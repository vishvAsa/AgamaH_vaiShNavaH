      <description>&lt;p&gt;Of this American mission, the rev. Mr. Ballantine, in a recent letter, says: “It may interest you to know that, during the ten years ending December, 31st, 1861, we received to the churches, on profession of their faith, 500 persons (not including six persons restored, who had been excommunicated). The number received during the previous twenty years—from the establishment of the mission, in 1831, to the end of 1851-was 171, besides six who came from other places, Two of the men received to this church the past year reside in villages eighteen miles north of Batral, and not far from the Godavery.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is Manbhāū sect that was prohibited from missionary activities and whose members were declared to lose their caste by the Government in June of 1782 for the reason that they destroyed Hindu temples and idols, shaved their heads in their own way, and wore their own special clothes. Regarding the sect, see I. M. P. Raeside: &amp;ldquo;A Bibliographical Index of Mahānubhāva Works in Marathi,” Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, vol. 23, Part 3, 1960, pp. 464-507.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
