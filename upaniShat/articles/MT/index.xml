      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2006/07/31/avyakta-origin-mythology/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The two tantric upaniShads, avyakta and nR^isiMha-tApini are clear in&#xA;their pA~ncharAtra affinities. Yet the saMkhya origin mythology of the&#xA;avyakta is a pretty remarkable piece that is worth considering, for it&#xA;is a rather distinctive expression of earliest stages of the universe.&#xA;While in general concepts is similar to the thoughts expressed in other&#xA;pA~ncharatra sAMkhya origin mythologies, such as the lakShmi-tantra, it&#xA;different in the details. Of course it does not go into the details of&#xA;the ta~nmAtras and their ontology like the account in the viShNu&#xA;purANa, but its clarification of the early events in just two paragraphs&#xA;is useful.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/1719907079476187481&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The text known as mahopaniShat that come down to us has at least 2 layers. The first section has a notable overlap with the nArAyaNavallI - see in the mahAnArAyaNopaniShat whose recensions are attached to the YV-taittirIya and atharvan traditions. This section as expounds nArAyaNa-paratvam along side a 25 tattva sAMkhya. It is clearly a vaiShNava text with sAMkhyan philosophical foundations overlapping with the ideas presented in the nArAyaNIya section of the Mbh. We believe a text close to this first section was alluded to in the said section of the Mbh.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
