## प्रामाण्य-क्रमः

दिव्यशास्त्रम् > मुनिभाषितम् (सात्त्विकम् > राजसम् > तामसम्) > पुरुषभाषितम्।

दिव्यशास्त्रे - पौष्कर-सात्त्वत-जयाख्याः। रत्न-त्रयम् इति ख्यातम्।  

मुनिभाषिते  
- सात्त्विके - ईश्वर-संहिता, भारद्वाज-संहिता, जयोत्तरम् …
- राजसे - सनत्कुमार-संहिता, वैखानसागमाः केचित्
- तामसे - तत्त्व-सङ्ग्रह-संहिता

दिव्यभाषिताविरोधेन मुनिभाषितस्य सात्त्विकता मीयते।

## प्राचीनता
### नारायणीयम्
> Meanwhile the 85 See Schreiner \(1997a: 1\) for these dates. According to Oberlies \(1997: 86\), the oldest sections of the *Nārāyaṇīya* \(chapters 321-326\) most likely belong to the period 200-300 CE. Hiltebeitel \(2006\), it should be noted, rejects these arguments and favours substantially earlier dates for the *Nārāyaṇīya*, and indeed the MBh as a whole.

### रत्न-त्रयम्
> In light of this, assigning these texts *en bloc* to one particular geographic region, or to one particular historical period, especially on the basis of a single, isolated passage or chapter, is surely a mistake. These are clearly not homogeneous, singly authored works, and it is hardly possible to retrieve the “original” Saṃhitās from the versions which have come down to us.

> previous scholarship on this subject which, as recently as 1994, favoured the much earlier date of c. 500 CE for the composition of the JS, SS and PauṣS \(Matsubara 1994: 34\). The allocation of this earlier date was largely based on the assumption that the *Ahirbudhnyasaṃhitā*, which itself refers to the JS and the SS, was known to the Kashmirian author Bhagavadutpala – an assumption which Sanderson \(2001: 35-8\) convincingly argues is unwarranted.

#### स्थानम्
> K. V. Soundara Rajan \(1981\), in a useful study of the JS’s 20th *paṭala*, argues that this chapter displays a knowledge of both Northern and Southern temple styles, and that the JS as a whole can therefore be assigned to Central India or the Upper Deccan, where both architectural forms were in concurrent use from an early period. 

### पारमेश्वर-संहिता
> The PārS incorporates passages from the *Nārāyaṇīya * section of the *Mahābhārata*, the *Ahirbudhnyasaṃhitā*, and the *Pādmasaṃhitā *\(PādS\)34 among others, and its author, or “compiler” as Rastelli proposes, clearly also had a close knowledge of each of the “three jewels”.
