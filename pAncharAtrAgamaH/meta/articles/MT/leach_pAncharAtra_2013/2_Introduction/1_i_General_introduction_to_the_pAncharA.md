## Pañcarātra
‘Pañcarātra’ or ‘Pāñcarātra’ is the name of a religious tradition which worships Viṣṇu, or a deity assimilated to Viṣṇu \(especially Nārāyaṇa or Vāsudeva\), as the highest god. 

## saṃhitā
The names *pañcarātra*/ *pāñcarātra* are also used to refer to the large scriptural corpus consisting of anonymously authored works in Sanskrit, ordinarily called *saṃhitā* \(“compendium”\), that were produced by the followers of this tradition. Although the individual Saṃhitās cannot be dated with any precision, most of them appear to have been composed between the ninth and the fourteenth century of the Common Era. 

The earliest of the extant works were very probably written in North India, in and around Kashmir. The majority of the published works, however, are products of South India, and the period c. 1100-1400 CE. 

The Saṃhitās are written, for the most part, in the same metre as the Sanskrit epics and much Classical Sanskrit poetry, namely the 32-syllable *anuṣṭubh śloka*. They are structured in the form of a dialogue, normally between sages or between a sage and god, in which one interlocutor instructs another in matters relating to the initiation rites by which one becomes a member of the tradition, the preparation for and performance of the post-initiatory worship of Viṣṇu, the rewards that can accrue from such worship, and various theological and cosmological topics. 

## Attestation
As is attested in the earliest textual sources which refer to the Pāñcarātra, including the *Nārāyaṇīya* section of the *Mahābhārata*, a seventh century stele inscription from Baset in Cambodia \(K. 447\), Śaṅkara’s *Brahmasūtrabhāṣya* \(on *sūtra* 2.2.42\), and the earlier Pāñcarātra Saṃhitās themselves, *pañcarātra* \(i.e. with a short first *a*\) is the older of the two names. The derived term *pāñcarātra*, meaning “*pertaining to* or *belonging to* the Pañcarātra”, is occasionally used to refer to the followers of the tradition \(see e.g. Kumārila’s *Tantravārttika*,[^1] and Rāmakaṇṭha’s 

[^1]: 

    On *sūtra* 1.3.4 \(328.16-17\), Kumārila mentions “the treatises \[which are a mixture\] of *dharma * and *adharma* \[that are\] accepted by the Sāṃkhyas, Yogas, Pāñcarātras, Pāśupatas, Buddhists and Jains” 
    
    \( *sāṃkhyayogapāñcarātrapāśupataśākya*\[ *nir*\] *granthaparigṛhītadharmādharmanibandhanāni*\). [[9]]

*Nareśvaraparīkṣāprakāśa* 87.22 *ff*\), though these are far more commonly called *pāñcarātrika* or, less often, *pāñcarātrin*. In the later South Indian literature, however, *pāñcarātra* became an increasingly common way to refer to the tradition itself. This convention has continued down to modern times, and *pāñcarātra* is now the standard name for the tradition in scholarly literature. Accordingly, and in spite of its being frequently anachronistic, in the following I refer to the tradition as “Pāñcarātra” unless I am referring directly to a textual passage which uses the earlier designation.[^2] 

## Origins of name
The origins of the name are mysterious, and its original meaning has been subject to a wide variety of interpretations, both within the scriptural literature \(see Smith 1980: 56-7\), and among modern Indological studies \(e.g. Schrader 1916: 24-6, van Buitenen 1962, Raghavan 1965, Neevel 1977: 8-10, Matsubara 1994: 123-27, Hudson 2002: 158-59\), though none of these is wholly convincing. 

## "Tradition"
The description of the Pāñcarātra as a “religious tradition” is itself not unproblematic. I refer here not so much to the qualifier “religious” which, as has been sufficiently demonstrated by a number of scholars \(e.g. Halbfass 1988: 310-48, Hacker 1995\), has no precise equivalent in Sanskrit, but rather to the term “tradition”. 

There are, indeed, a number of Sanskrit words which can be reasonably translated as “tradition” in this sense \(e.g. *āgama*, * āmnāya*, *paramparā*, *pāramparya*, * sampradāya*\), though in fact among these only *āgama* is regularly employed as a term of self-description by the authors of the Saṃhitās, principally to designate the scriptural corpus of the Pāñcarātra or a particular work within it. More commonly, the Pāñcarātra is characterised in its own literature as a teaching \( *upaniṣad*, *śāstra*\), a body of knowledge \( *jñāna*\), a system \( *tantra*\), a path \( *mārga*\), or a set of injunctions \( *vidhi*, *vidhāna*\). It is worth pointing out that while the noun *tantra* is frequently applied to the Pāñcarātra in the Saṃhitās, these texts rarely use the derived adjective *tāntrika *\(“Tantric”, i.e. pertaining to the Tantra/s\) when referring to their own rituals or adherents. In contrast, when the Pāñcarātra is characterised by outsiders, whether by its religious rivals \(see e.g. Yāmuna’s *Āgamaprāmāṇya * 53.10-11\) or, indeed, by 

[^2]: I also follow the scholarly convention of referring to a person or group of persons who worship Viṣṇu or one of his manifestations as “Vaiṣṇava”, though this is, again, frequently an anachronism. [[10]]

modern scholars, this term is used quite often.3 Modern scholars have described the Pāñcarātra variously, for example as a “cult” \(Colas 1990, Matsubara 1994\), a Vaiṣṇava and Tantric “sect” \(Gupta 1991\), “une école âgamique” \(Colas 1995\), and “\[einer\] wichtigen Strömung innerhalb der viṣṇuitischen Religion” \(Bock-Raming 2002: 2\). 

## Diversity
The characterisation of the Pāñcarātra as a “religious tradition” is potentially problematic insofar as it can carry the implication that the Pāñcarātra is a single system of beliefs and practices, and that Pāñcarātrikas therefore share a single religious identity. However, even the most cursory reading of a number of Saṃhitās reveals a striking heterogeneity in their liturgical and theological material. In addition, a closer analysis of these works, as well as of other texts which refer to Pāñcarātrikas, shows that the Pāñcarātra consisted, very probably from its outset, of a diverse range of followers. 

Not uncommonly, one set of followers would distinguish themselves from another on the basis of their practices, their doctrines or their scriptural allegiance. In this thesis, I provide a historical study of the divisions within the Pāñcarātra as based on the available textual evidence. I show that scriptural allegiance became one of the crucial factors in distinguishing between distinct Pāñcarātrika identities, and that the formation of the Pāñcarātra scriptural canon involved precisely the renegotiation of such allegiances. 

## Earlier study
The first in-depth study of the distinct traditions within the Pāñcarātra was provided by Rastelli \(2006\). This lengthy German language volume concentrates primarily on the fourfold division of the Pāñcarātra as described in several South Indian texts dating from the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. It is my hope that this thesis will add to Rastelli’s important study. 

Although previous scholarship on the Pāñcarātra paid little attention to its internal divisions, and therefore to the distinct religious identities of the authors of the extant Saṃhitās, there have nonetheless been several important studies of the Pāñcarātra over the past century. The first major scholarly work was F. Otto Schrader’s *Introduction to the Pāñcarātra and the Ahirbudhnya Saṃhitā* \(1916\), which remains to this day a valuable introduction to the 

[^3]: When applied to the Pāñcarātra by its rivals, the term “Tantric” carries the primary sense of “non-Vedic” \( *avaidika*\). In other words, the allegiance of Pāñcarātrikas is to the Tantras *rather than* the Vedas. See also Colas \(1990\) and Hüsken \(2009: 47, 111\). [[11]]

theogonic and cosmological speculations found in the Saṃhitās, despite the fact that it foregrounds a somewhat atypical Pāñcarātra text. The same year saw the publication of the *Ahirbudhnyasaṃhitā*, critically edited by M. D. Ramanujacharya under Schrader’s supervision. The next significant volumes in Pāñcarātra studies were E. 

Krishnamacharya’s critical edition \(based on South Indian manuscripts\) of the *Jayākhyasaṃhitā* \(1931\), and S. Krishnaswami Aiyangar’s edition and translation into English of the *Paramasaṃhitā* \(1940\). From the end of the 1960s, scholarship on the Pāñcarātra has gathered pace. Important early works during this period are H. Daniel Smith’s *A Sourcebook of Vaiṣṇava Iconography According to Pāñcarātrāgama Texts* \(1969\), and his indispensable two-volume *A Descriptive Bibliography of the Printed Texts of the Pāñcarātrāgama* \(1975; 1980\), containing a chapter-by-chapter summary of over thirty published works, as well as several unpublished ones, and a comprehensive subject index. The chapters on the Pāñcarātra in Gonda’s *Medieval Religious Literature in Sanskrit* \(1977\) are heavily indebted to this study. Also from this period, Sanjukta Gupta’s translation into English of the *Lakṣmītantra* \(1972\) generated a greater interest in the Pāñcarātra among scholars, though its value to modern scholarship on this subject is somewhat limited by the fact that, like the focus of Schrader’s pioneering study, the *Lakṣmītantra* is an atypical Pāñcarātra text. Over the next two decades, Gupta produced several important articles, including a diachronic study of the role of initiation \( *dīkṣā*\) in Pāñcarātra scriptures \(1983\). V. 

Varadachari’s *Āgamas and South Indian Vaiṣṇavism* \(1982\) contains valuable information on a wide variety of texts, as does M. Matsubara’s *Pāñcarātra Saṃhitās and Early Vaiṣṇava Theology* \(1994\), which can be viewed as a more comprehensive and up-to-date undertaking of Schrader’s project. No doubt a consequence of its being published by a small Indian publishing house, Varadachari’s book has not been cited much in subsequent scholarship, a fate that has also befallen, for similar reasons, H. Hikita’s very useful annotated translations \(published separately in Japan from 1990\) of most of the chapters of the *Sātvatasaṃhitā*. In an important sense Hikita’s work on the *Sātvatasaṃhitā* represents a turning point in Pāñcarātra studies: the first closely annotated translation of a Pāñcarātra Saṃhitā which frequently cross-references other Pāñcarātra texts. 

Since then, the [[12]] *Īśvarasaṃhitā* has been critically edited and translated into English by M. A. Lakshmithathachar, with revisions by V. Varadachari \(2009\). Subsequent to Hikita’s work, scholarship on the Pāñcarātra has tended to focus on one text, or on certain chapters of a text, in particular. Thus, Flood \(1992, 2000, 2006\) has concentrated in several studies on particular chapters of the *Jayākhyasaṃhitā*. Hikita \(2005\) has written a lengthy article on the installation of divine images in the *Sātvatasaṃhitā*. 

Most prominently, Rastelli \(1999, 2006\) and Czerniak-Drożdżowicz \(2003\) have produced book-length studies on, respectively, philosophical-cum-theological beliefs in the *Jayākhyasaṃhitā*, representations of the Pāñcarātra in the *Pārameśvarasaṃhitā*, and the layered composition of the *Paramasaṃhitā*, though Rastelli \(2006\), especially, also incorporates detailed analysis of other Pāñcarātra texts. Both of these authors have also published important articles on subjects related to Pāñcarātra ritual. 

These studies fundamentally differ from the earlier works of, for instance, Schrader, Varadachari and Matsubara, all of which attempt to find commonalities among Pāñcarātra texts, and so reach general conclusions about “the Pāñcarātra tradition”. 

To be sure, studies on particular topics or themes within the Pāñcarātra corpus continue to be produced, as for example Sferra \(1994\), Bock-Raming \(2002\), and Rastelli \(2002a\), but these now tend to be the exception rather than the rule, and they ordinarily address more circumscribed subjects than e.g. Pāñcarātra “theology” or “philosophy”, as well as being generally sensitive to the heterogeneous contents of the Saṃhitās.
