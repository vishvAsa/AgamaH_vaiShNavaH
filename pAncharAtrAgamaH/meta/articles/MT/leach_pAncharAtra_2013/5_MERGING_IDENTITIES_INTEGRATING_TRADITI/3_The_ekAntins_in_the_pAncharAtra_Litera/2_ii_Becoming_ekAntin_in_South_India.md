title = "2 ii \\) Becoming Ekāntin in South India"

+++

It is clear that, from the time of the composition of the *Nārāyaṇīya*, the word *ekāntin* has been used as a general term of commendation, as a means of conferring authority and expertise upon deserving persons, whether real or imagined. As we have seen in 364 ĀP 142.16-17: *yadi paraṃ te paramapuruṣam evāśritā ekāntinaḥ, anye kṣudradaivatakāḥ*

*sādhāraṇā iti*/. See also the SanS \( *Ṛṣirātra * 3.111cd\), where *ekāntacintanā * is explained as “never thinking of another god” \( *deve nānyacintā kadācana*\). As we have seen, the SanS is quoted by Yāmuna, and so predates him. [[215]]

several examples above, when the term is used in this “informal”, non-specific way, the passage in which it appears will often allude, either directly or indirectly, to the *Nārāyaṇīya*. The JS’s and the ViṣṇuS’s accounts of Ekāntins and Ekāntikas are different. They purport to offer factual descriptions of a particular class of Vaiṣṇava, and presumably because their primary aim is to describe rather than to praise, they make no appeals to the authority of the *Nārāyaṇīya*. Indeed, although the Ekāntin/Ekāntika depicted in these works is a renunciant, there is little to suggest that he is the same figure that we encounter in the *Śāntiparvan*. Contrarily, as we might expect, when *ekāntin* is used in this specifically descriptive or taxonomic sense but as a term of *self*-description, it suits the purposes of the authors to refer to the *Nārāyaṇīya* quite frequently, as is demonstrated especially in the opening chapters of the PārS and ĪS. 

It is not always easy to determine whether *ekāntin * is being used as a general term of commendation or as a proper name labelling a specific religious identity. 

Āgamasiddhānta or Ekāyana scriptural sources, whose authors likely called themselves Ekāntin, on certain occasions also use the term in the former sense. Thus, when we read in the ĪS of “those illustrious Ekāntins, headed by Śaṭhakopa, who have descended to the earth in order to restore mankind”,365 it is obvious that *ekāntin* is being used here as a straightforward honorific. The author is taking a term of commendation from his own religious culture and applying it retrospectively to a figure from the rather distant past, in this instance the famous ninth-tenth century Tamil devotional poet better known as Nammāḻvār. Although this affords us an insight into the esteem in which Nammāḻvār was held in certain Pāñcarātrika circles perhaps nearly half a millennium after his death, I do not consider this to be an especially significant use of the word *ekāntin*. Similar examples may be found elsewhere. Sometimes, inevitably, the application of the term is rather more ambiguous. In these verses from the NārS, for instance, *ekāntin* is also seemingly being used as a general term of commendation, but the fact that it associates Ekāntins 365 ĪS 8.175c-176b: *ekāntino mahābhāgāḥ śaṭhakopapuraḥsarāḥ*// *kṣoṇyāṃ kṛtāvatārā ye lokojjīvanahetunā*/. [[216]]

with supernatural powers and “worldly” desires makes it rather more striking, as does its suggestion that one may become an Ekāntin quite easily: *dvādaśyāṃ caivam eva hi*// *pāraṇaṃ yaḥ prakurvīta dīkṣitair vaiṣṇavaiḥ saha*

/ *sa bhaved bhaktimān viṣṇau tathaikāntitvam āpnuyāt*// *kaivalyaṃ cāpnuyāt paścāt nātra kāryā vicāraṇā*/ *aṇimādiguṇān vāpi kāṃkṣitān aihikāṃs tu vā*//. 

– “Whoever should break the fast along with initiated Vaiṣṇavas on the twelfth day \[of the month of Mārgaśīrṣa\], he is truly devoted to Viṣṇu and can therefore attain the status of an Ekāntin. And then he can attain perfect isolation \( *kaivalya*\), or else the supernatural powers such as miniaturisation etc.,366 or indeed \[whatever\] worldly gains are desired. With regard to this matter, there need be no inquiry \(i.e. it is clear\).” \(NārS 24.53d-55\) 

It is difficult to know whether to attach any significance to the use of the word *ekāntin* in this passage, though it seems unlikely that it is being used to refer to one particular group of Pāñcarātrikas.367 In the following I address a few passages from scriptural sources which I believe can tell us something interesting and significant about the particular group of South Indian Pāñcarātrikas who called themselves Ekāntins \(and Āgamasiddhāntins and Ekāyanas\). As we have seen, these Pāñcarātrikas present themselves as continuous with the Ekāntins of the *Nārāyaṇīya*. 

They identify their own ‘Veda’, the Ekāyanaveda, with the teaching given to Nārada in that work, and they characterise themselves as not “desiring” the fruits of their worship \( *niṣkāma*, *aphalārthin*, *nirāśīḥkarma* etc. See e.g. MBh 12.328.30f, 336.29d, PauṣS 31.286ab, PārS 1.35d, 25.55d\). Moreover, as in the following verse from the PauṣS \(31.149c-150\), which I have quoted already in Chapter Two, they positively condemn the practice of worshipping god as a means of satisfying desires: “The omniscient abiding in the heart does not permit \[worship that is performed with\] 

desire. One who grants heaven to his devotees even when it is not asked for – what is it that is not given by him? Therefore, one should abandon requests\!” 

[^366]: This is a reference to the eight classical *siddhi* s alluded to at *Yogasūtra* 3.45, and elaborated in the commentaries. Here, as elsewhere in the Pāñcarātra Saṃhitās \(e.g. JS 6.70c, SS 18.165ab\), the word *guṇa* is used instead of *siddhi*. This practice is also quite common in the Śaiva scriptural literature \(Mallinson 2011: 330 n. 16\). 

[^367]: Elsewhere in the NārS, the word appears to be used merely as a general term of commendation. At NārS 25.388, for example, the Ekāntins are named as “the most excellent Bhāgavatas” 

\( *bhāgavatottamāḥ*\). [[217]]

However, inevitably the South Indian Pāñcarātrika ‘Ekāntins’ had to adapt to a religious environment which was substantially different from that which formed the background to the *Nārāyaṇīya*. For example, the yogic and ascetic frames of reference by means of which the identity of the Ekāntins was originally established had to be radically reinterpreted in order to remain applicable in these different circumstances. Of course, this process is encountered already in the later chapters of the *Nārāyaṇīya* itself, wherein “renunciation” is reinterpreted, as it is in the *Bhagavadgītā*, to mean the renunciation of actions motivated by desire. This understanding of renunciation is found also in the Pāñcarātra Saṃhitās, as we will see in the following chapter. But the textual evidence suggests that South Indian Ekāntins also had to adapt to changing circumstances *in South India*. For example, there are indications, as demonstrated in this passage from the PauṣS, that they came to modify their position on worship undertaken in order to fulfill personal desires: *phalamūlānnapratiṣṭhāṃ śṛṇu vakṣye phalārthinām* / *nānnadānāt paraṃ*

*dānaṃ triṣu lokeṣu vidyate*// *sadyaḥprītikaraṃ hṛdyaṃ prāṇadaṃ prāṇinām api*/ *utpattāv api saṃskāre rasam annasya kīrtitam*// *annād bhavanti bhūtāni tasmāt sarvaṃ pratiṣṭhitam* / *tac ca pratiṣṭhitaṃ yena tena sarvaṃ pratiṣṭhitam* 

// *putradāradhanair annair vṛddhiṃ yāti kṣaṇāt kṣaṇam* / *prāpnoti paramām pūjām utkṛṣṭebhyo mahattarām*// *hṛṣṭaḥ puṣṭas tato bhūtvā tṛpto bhavati* *sarvadā* / *bhuktvā bhogān suvipulān ante nārāyaṇālayam* // *yāti* *candrapratīkāśair vimānair devanirmitaiḥ*/ *svargādau sarvaloke tu sthitvā*

*kalpaśatān bahūn* // *kālāt punar ihāyāti deśe sarvottame śubhe* / *satāṃ kule* *samāsādya janma jāty uttamaṃ mahat* // *jāyate rūpavān vāggmī*

*vidyājñānaparāyaṇah*/ *dviṣatām api sarveṣāṃ pūjyaḥ priyataras sadā* // 

*śīlavān śauryasampanno dhṛtyutsāhasamanvitaḥ* / *dvijadevaparo nityaṃ dātā*

*bhūtahite rataḥ* // *ekāntī dharmavettā vai nārāyaṇaparāyaṇaḥ* / *trivargam* *akhilam bhuktvā yathābhimatalakṣaṇaḥ*// *janma\(ā\)bhyas taṃ śubhaṃ karma* *kṛtvānantaguṇaṃ punaḥ* / *jñānam āsādyate yena prayāti paramaṃ padam* //. – 

“Listen\! I will explain the dedication \(or consecration\) of fruits, roots and \[other\] 

foods for those who desire the fruits \[of worship, *phalārthin*\]. In the three worlds there is no gift better than the gift of food. It immediately gives pleasure, \[and\] is appetising and restorative to beings. Even at the stage of preparation and dressing the tastiness of food is well-known\! \[All\] living beings come into being from food. From that everything is founded, and by one who has dedicated that, by him everything is founded. As long as he lives in this world, \[and\] in the heavenly world called Brahma\[loka\], he \[who dedicates food\] may live without sickness and pain. By means of \[donating\] food, he reaches lasting prosperity, with sons, wives and wealth. He receives the greatest honour from eminent elders. The gods, seers and perfected beings always consider carefully the highest welfare for him, together with increased longevity. Thus, being joyful 218 

and well-nourished, he is ever satisfied. Enjoying numerous pleasures, at death he goes to the abode of Nārāyaṇa by means of moon-like chariots made by the gods. Abiding in all worlds, beginning with heaven, for many hundreds of Kalpas, in the course of time he comes here again, to a supremely auspicious place. Achieving a birth in a respectable family, the most excellent birth, he is born with handsome form, eloquent, devoted to learning and knowledge. Ever more beloved, he is revered by all, even his enemies. Possessed of good character, might, constancy and strength, a donor \( *dātṛ*\) is always best among Brahmins, intent upon the welfare of beings. \[He is\] an Ekāntin, a knower of *dharma*, wholly devoted to Nārāyaṇa. Thoroughly enjoying the group of three \(i.e. the three *puruṣārtha* s\), possessed of the desired qualities, endlessly acting righteously through \[numerous\] lifetimes, knowledge is reached, by which he advances to the supreme abode.” \(PauṣS 41.143-155\) 

There is no doubt that this passage has been inserted into the PauṣS, for the redactor responsible has made no effort to disguise the fact – the next verses follow on from those which precede this excerpt. Needless to say, the relevant idea expressed here, i.e. that one can become an Ekāntin by means of making a donation to a temple, represents a radically different view of the Ekāntins from any we have encountered thus far. We are a long way here from the idealised depiction of the yogic-ascetic Ekāntins in the *Nārāyaṇīya*, and in later scriptural works such as the ParS and the LT. The fact that these verses are addressed to worshippers who desire fruits \( *phalārthin*\) only serves to emphasise the dramatic nature of this shift in attitude, for elsewhere in the PauṣS, as we have seen, such worshippers are openly condemned. 

My reason for proposing that this passage has been authored by a self-identifying Ekāntin, and that the term *ekāntin* is thus significant in this context, is that the donor is promised a *rebirth* as an Ekāntin, a reward which is hardly likely to have been offered by a non-Ekāntin Pāñcarātrika, for whom the initiation rite \( *dīkṣā*\) establishes the candidate’s eligibility to join Viṣṇu in his “supreme abode” \(see e.g. 

PādS cp 21.15, LT 41.5c-6, ŚrīprśS 16.18c-19\). As we have seen, according to several sources the Ekāyana or Āgamasiddhānta is a tradition that one is born into, rather than one which is joined through initiation, so the promise of a rebirth as an Ekāntin is, at least “officially”, the best offer that can be made to non-Āgamasiddhāntins. Elsewhere in the PauṣS we find similar expressions of the same idea. For instance, in a passage concerning the festival centred around the investiture 219 

of god’s icon with the sacred thread \( *pavitrāropaṇa*\), it is said that a man \( *nara*\) who makes unending donations of cattle, land and gold \( *gobhūsuvarṇa*\) on a daily basis \( *pratyaha*\) for as long as he lives, will attain the fruit \( *phala*\) of these donations 

“during a maximum lifespan” \( *paramāyuṣi*\), and will then journey to heaven \( *diva*\) 

“by means of moon-like carriages” \( *yānaiś candrapratīkāśaiḥ*\) \(PauṣS 30.174c-177\). 

Born again into an auspicious family, he will become devoted to Nārāyaṇa in thought, word and deed \( *karmaṇā manasā vācā nārāyaṇaparo bhavet*, PauṣS 

30.180cd\), will live a long life free of sickness and sorrow \( *vyādhiśokavinirmukta*\), with sons and wives etc. \( *putradārādika*\), and then will go to White Island \( *śvetadvīpa*\), where he will achieve identification with the supreme *brahman* \( *paraṃ*

*brahmatvam āyāti*\) \(PauṣS 30.178c-184b\). Although there is no explicitly “sectarian” 

terminology employed in these verses, it is fairly certain that it has been authored by an Ekāyana or ‘Ekāntin’ for the same reasons I have put forward with regard to the passage regarding the donation of food: a worshipper who desires the “fruit” of worship cannot attain liberation in this lifetime. The best he can hope for in this regard is an auspicious rebirth as one who is completely devoted \(“in thought, word and deed”\) to Nārāyaṇa. Only then may he go to White Island. 

In another passage of the PauṣS which conveys the same idea, the sectarian identity of the author is even more explicit. In this passage it is said that providing the “mixed worshipper” \( *vyāmiśrayājin*\) has undergone initiation and is completely devoted to Nārāyaṇa, to rituals such as mantra-repetition \( *japa*\) and the fire-sacrifice \( *homa*\), and to singing hymns of praise \( *stuti*\), “he can attain the world of Viṣṇu at death and, having obtained a superior rebirth, he may become, from \[the time of his\] 

childhood, O best among the twice-born, a Tanmaya, well-versed in the rituals of the Lord, and having him as his highest aim.”368 As we have seen, ‘Tanmaya’ is yet another name for ‘Ekāyana’, ‘Āgamasiddhāntin’ or, in the South Indian context, 

‘Ekāntin’. These verses just referred to are indubitably the work of an Ekāyana author since they follow on from the passage addressed in previous chapters wherein Ekāyanas are hailed as ‘Ekāntins’, and mixed worshippers are called “devotees in 368 PauṣS 36.265-266b: *dehānte vaiṣṇavaṃ lokaṃ prāpnuyāt punar eva hi*/ *janma cāsādya cotkṛṣṭam* *ābālyād dvijasattama*// *bhagavatkarmaniṣṇātaḥ tatparas tanmayo bhavet*//. [[220]]

appearance only”.369 The following verse, meanwhile, states that “Not aiming at the fruit \[of worship\], even in times of distress, he will not attain a rebirth in this world after leaving his body, O Pauṣkara.”370 The sectarian tenor of this passage as a whole, including its stated opposition to “mixed devotion” \(PauṣS 36.259cd\) and to worship undertaken in order to achieve a “fruit”, suggests to me that this was an earlier interpolation into the PauṣS than were the passages \(i.e. PauṣS 41.143-155 and 30.174c-184b\) quoted above on the donation of food, and “cattle, land and gold” to a temple. My reasons for believing this will become clear shortly. 

As we seen in Chapter Five, there are a number of passages in the PauṣS which refer to “mixed worshippers” \( *vyāmiśrayājin*\). These worshippers are Pāñcarātrikas who do not belong to the Ekāyana tradition. They are described as Brahmins \(PauṣS 

36.263a\), and they are depicted as having expertise in the Vedas \(PauṣS 27.711ab, see also SS 2.8cd\). They are contrasted on one occasion with Brahmins who are 

“exclusive” worshippers \( *ananyayājin*, 27.110c\), and on another with those who 

“seek refuge in no other” \( *ananyaśaraṇa*, 36.78a\). Elsewhere, in the earlier verses of the passage referred to above \(PauṣS 36.259c-263b\), the mixed worshippers are said to worship the retinue of subordinate deities \( *gaṇa*\), and they are contrasted here again with “exclusive” worshippers \( *nānyayājin*\) who are identified as Ekāyanas and are said to be Ekāntins. In this instance, as has just been restated, the mixed worshippers are denounced as “devotees in appearance only” \( *bhaktābhāsāḥ*\), and it is said that one should never practise “mixed devotion” \( *bhaktisāṅkarya*\). 

In a later chapter of the PauṣS, Pauṣkara asks God for a clarification with regard to the status of mixed worship, while pointing out that this has been repeatedly prohibited thus far.371 God replies: 

*satyam etan mahābuddhe yathā sañcoditaṃ tvayā*// *kintu kriyāntare prāpte na* *dośas tv adhikāriṇām*/ *yasmāt sarvaparatvaṃ hi teṣām asty acyutaṃ prati*// 

[^369]: The PārS, which was also authored by Ekāyanas, also promises rebirth as an Ekāyana to non-Ekāyana Pāñcarātrikas who correctly perform their duties. The passage in question \(PārS 13.114c-115\) has been discussed by Rastelli \(2006: 194\). 

[^370]: PauṣS 36.266c-267b: *nābhisandhāya ca phalam āpatkālagato ’pi vai*// *tyaktvā dehaṃ*

*punarjanma nāpnuyād iha pauṣkara*/. 

[^371]: PauṣS 38.47-48b: *deva vyāmiśrayājitvaṃ pratiṣiddhaṃ punaḥ punaḥ*/ *prāguktānāṃ ca yāgānāṃ*

*draṣṭum aṅgīkṛtaṃ ca yat*// *tanmātrasaṃśayaṃ jātaṃ chettum arhasi sāṃpratam*/. [[221]]

*tadāśritatvād devānām anyeṣāṃ pūjanāt tu vai*// *na doṣo hi yathā loke* *bhrātṛbhṛtyagaṇasya ca*/ *mānanād dharmapatnīnāṃ…*//. – * *“This is true, O 

wise one, just as you have urged. But when this other type of ritual \(i.e. “mixed worship”\) is valid, then there is no fault for those who are qualified, since for them Acyuta is superior to all. \[Therefore\] because they are subordinate to him, there is no fault in worshipping other gods, just as in one’s everyday life \[there is no fault\] in paying honour to a retinue \( *gaṇa*\) of servants, or to one’s brothers, or to one’s lawful wives”. \(PauṣS 38.48c-50c\) 

What can we deduce from these verses? First of all, they have evidently been added to the PauṣS after the “sectarian” portions which forbid the practice of mixed worship, for they refer directly to these prohibitions. Since these sectarian portions were clearly authored by Ekāyanas, who called themselves Ekāntins and proclaimed themselves superior to mixed worshippers partly on account of their monotheism, we must assume either that a.\) these verses were authored by a Pāñcarātrika who was himself a “mixed worshipper” as opposed to an Ekāyana, or that b.\) they were authored by an Ekāyana, and therefore provide evidence that some Ekāyanas, at least, changed their attitude towards “mixed worship”. I propose that the second explanation is the correct one, for the passage in which these verses are found, concerned with the installation \( *pratiṣṭhā*\) of the image of god \( *bhagavadbimba*\) in a temple, is clearly the work of an Ekāyana author. This is evident from the fact that the “principal ordinance” \( *mukhyakalpam*, PauṣS 38.41b\) for the installation is assigned to the knowers of the five times who are “exclusive” devotees \( *ananyāḥ*, PauṣS 38.31a\), who are devoted to the four Vyūhas and who peform the renunciation of actions \( *karmaṇām api saṃnyāsaṃ kurvanti*, PauṣS 38.32\), while the secondary or 

“alternative” ordinance \( *anukalpa*\) is to be performed by initiated twice-born Bhāgavatas who are “established in the *dharma* of the triple Veda” 

\( *trayīdharmasthitaiḥ*, PauṣS 38.41c-42\). The former group clearly denotes the Ekāyanas, while the latter are the Pāñcarātrikas who are elsewhere referred to as 

“mixed worshippers”. 

It could be argued that the verses which validate mixed worship were simply appended to this description of the principal and secondary rules for installation by a later redactor who was himself a mixed worshipper. In support of this, it could be pointed out that the PārS \(19.299c-340\) incorporates the passages PauṣS 38.26c-46 [[222]]

and 51-72b, but crucially not the verses we are presently addressing. Indeed, the omission of these verses in the PārS is interesting. However, in my view such a scenario is unlikely, both on account of the reference in these verses to the repeated prohibition of mixed worship, and because the following verses \(i.e. PauṣS 38.51 *ff*\), which *have* been incorporated into the PārS, seamlessly continue the discussion. 

Moreover, the PārS itself attests to there being a certain lack of clarity on the issue of the participation of the Ekāyanas, or ‘Ekāntins’ as they are called here, in a practice which the PauṣS \(36.262c-263b\) presents as being a key characteristic of “mixed worship”, namely the worship of the subordinate deities \( *gaṇa*\) of Viṣṇu. The passage reads as follows: 

*vāstukṣetreśagaruḍadvārśrīcaṇḍrapracaṇḍrakān*// *abhyarcyārghyādibhir* *devān prāsādasthāṃś ca pūjayet*/ *prāsāde ’tha caturdvāre maṇḍape cetareṣu* *ca*// *dvāratraye ’tha dhātāraṃ vidhātāraṃ jayaṃ tathā*/ *vijayaṃ cāpi* *bhadraṃ ca subhadraṃ ca ganeśvaram*// *yad aṅgabhāvam abhyeti* *dvārsthādyaṃ devatāgaṇam* / *viṣvaksenāvasānaṃ ca narāṇām alpamedhasām* 

// *jantor ekāntinas tad vai cittakhedakṛd arcanam* / *vighnakṛt prakṛtasyāpi* *śiṣyāṇāṃ tadanarcanam*// *atas tadanukampārthaṃ devabhṛtyadhiyārcanam* / 

*bhaktiśraddhojjhitaṃ caiva vihitaṃ tv evam eva hi* // *…*/ *…*// *etāvad arcanāt* *teṣāṃ guror ekāntinas tu vai*/ *syād virodhanirāsas tu yato bhṛtyas tu te hareḥ*

//. – “After worshipping Vāstu \(or ‘Vāstvīśa’ i.e. Vāstupuruṣa, the guardian deity of the temple\), Kṣetreśa, Garuḍa, Dvārśrī \(also known as Dvāralakṣmī\), Caṇḍa and Pracaṇḍa with *arghya* and so on, one should worship the temple gods in the temple, and the others in the pavillion at \[each of\] the four \[entrance-\]gates. 

Then, at the three gates \[one should worship\] Dhātṛ and Vidhātṛ, and also Jaya and Vijaya, and Bhadra and Subhadra, and the Lord of the Gaṇas \(i.e. 

Viṣvaksena\]. Worship from \(i.e. by\)372 a man \[who is\] an Ekāntin which is directed towards the subordinate class of deities who form God’s retinue, beginning with the gatekeepers and ending with Viṣvaksena, causes distress to the minds of men who have little understanding. \[But\] not worshipping them, even if it is done \[only\] for \(or by?\) the pupils \[of the priest\], causes obstacles. 

Therefore, worship with \[one’s\] thought \[directed upon\] the \[deities who are the\] 

servants of god is enjoined in order to elicit their compassion, though \[it should be done\] without devotion and loyalty… Thus, from the worship of these 

\[subordinate deities\] by an Ekāntin guru, strife will be cast out, since they are the servants of Hari.” \(PārS 6.125c-130, 132c-133b\) 

[^372]: The use of the ablative/genitive case here \( *jantor ekāntinaḥ*\) seems strange. In his commentary on the ĪS, Alaśiṅgabhaṭṭa is unsure of how to interpret this, and one of his suggestions is to take it as an ablative absolutive \( *lyablope pañcamī*\) – see *Sātvatārthaprakāśikā* on ĪS 4.3. However, this is not convincing. [[223]]

It is very difficult to draw any firm conclusions from this passage, which is also found in the ĪS.373 I am unable to satisfactorily translate the verse and half-verse \(6.131-132b\) I have omitted, though their gist, I believe, is that the subordinate deities “mentally” \( *manasā*\) accept worship “even if it is given without respect” 

\( *dattam apy avahelayā*\), and that because they are \(ultimately speaking\) “made of Acyuta” \( *acyutamayāḥ*\), their minds are extensions of his.374 How are we to interpret the passage in general? It appears to indicate that Ekāntins were being criticised in some quarters for worshipping members of Viṣṇu’s entourage, such as Viṣvaksena, the gatekeepers to the temple, and other temple deities.375 Presumably, if such criticism genuinely existed, it was based on the notion that worshipping these subordinate deities violated the Ekāntins’ commitment to monotheism. It is to be noted that in his ĀP, Yāmuna also makes the point that the subordinate deities are, like the lord of Viṣṇu’s retinue \(i.e. Viṣvaksena\), “dependent upon Viṣṇu”.376 

However, Yāmuna does not make this assertion in response to a specific criticism that Pāñcarātrikas worship Viṣṇu’s subordinate deities. Indeed, there is no indication in the ĀP that the Pāñcarātra’s Mīmāṃsaka opponents were critical of this practice, or that they felt that it somehow compromised the ideal of monotheism. If the criticism of the Ekāntin worship of Viṣṇu’s entourage was not coming from orthodox outsiders, then, from where was it coming? This is a very difficult question to answer, but we should not overlook the possibility that such criticism may have come from other Ekāntins. The author’s strategy in the above passage is to legitimate the Ekāntin worship of the subordinate deities by providing scriptural authority for it, but he also attempts to minimise the “distress” that this may cause by emphasising that this worship is, and *should be*, performed without devotion, loyalty, and respect, and that, in any case, the subordinate deities are “made of Acyuta”, and so any charge of abandoning monotheism would not apply. 

[^373]: PārS 6.124c-126b → ĪS 3.100-101; PārS 6.128-133b → ĪS 4.2c-7. 

[^374]: PārS 6.131-132b: *te tat prāṇicyutaṃ prahvā dattam apy avahelayā*/ *gṛhṇanti manasā śreyaḥ*

*paraṃ dhyātvā dhiyā hṛdi*// *yataḥ sarve ’cyutamayās taccittārpitamānasāḥ*/. Note that ĪS 4.5a reads *te tat pāṇicyutaṃ prahvā*. 

[^375]: On the mythical plane Caṇḍra, Pracaṇḍra, Dhātṛ, Vidhātṛ, Jaya, Vijaya, Bhadra and Subhadra are the gatekeepers of Vaikuṇṭha, Viṣṇu’s heaven. 

[^376]: ĀP 168 6-7: *devatāgaṇaḥ*// *guṇabhūtaḥ śruto viṣṇor viṣṇupāriṣadeśavat*/. [[224]]

Much of this is hypothetical, but when read in tandem with the PauṣS’s legitimation of valid forms of “mixed worship” for those who are qualified, these verses in the PārS and the ĪS do appear to indicate that some Ekāntins \(or Ekāyanas etc.\) were participating in forms of worship, specifically in temples, that members of their tradition had previously condemned. However, that the Ekāntin worship of Viṣṇu’s subordinate deities appears to have attracted controversy is itself rather difficult to explain within the broader history of the Pāñcarātra. For the Pāñcarātrika worship of Viṣṇu’s divine retinue is enjoined throughout the scriptural literature, both in its oldest documents, and in South Indian works including the PārS and the ĪS 

themselves. The worship of Viṣvaksena, for example, is attested to with such frequency throughout the Saṃhitās that I do not need to cite individual instances here. How, then, can we explain the statement that the Ekāntin worship of such deities as Viṣvaksena “causes distress” to some people? If Ekāntins or Ekāyanas had only recently taken on the worship of Viṣvaksena et al., it implies that they had a very minimal role in the composition of the early Saṃhitās, and indeed the remainder of the scriptural corpus. Alternatively, it may be proposed that the “absolute monotheism” which rejected this sort of worship was itself only a recent phenomenon among Pāñcarātrikas, and that it was, then, rather short-lived. In my view, the second explanation is more likely to be correct, for we do not find strictures against mixed worship in the JS, the SS, or the apparently older parts of the PauṣS. It is only in those sections of the PauṣS that were authored by Ekāyanas, which I propose were added to the text in South India, and in the PārS and the ĪS that we find such strictures. 

This proposal is also consistent with my hypothesis that the sectarianism which characterised certain South Indian Pāñcarātrika contexts was itself only relatively brief. It was, as I have suggested in Chapter Five, probably within such contexts that the Ekāyanas invented the tradition of the Ekāyanaveda and of the four distinct Pāñcarātra Siddhāntas. If this is correct, it seems reasonable to suggest that the explicit self-identification of the Ekāyanas with the Ekāntins of the *Nārāyaṇīya*, and their concomitant “absolute monotheism” also originated during this period, and for similar reasons. Faced with competition for the control of temples and the 225 

performance of rituals for fee-paying clients with other Pāñcarātrikas who claimed association with the Vedic tradition, the Ekāyanas sought to establish their own orthodox credentials. As we have seen in Chapter Five, the Ekāyana Pāñcarātrikas had probably always been liberation-seekers \( *mumukṣu*\) who renounced personal desires \( *niṣkāma* etc\), and they may have had genuine, albeit very distant, links to the religious culture represented in the *Nārāyaṇīya*. However, it appears to have been only in South India that the Ekāyanas began to explicitly represent themselves as Ekāntins. Admittedly, our information on the Kashmirian Ekāyanas is rather sparse, but there is no indication in the so-called *Saṃvitprakāśa*, for example, that the Ekāntins represented an important ideal to Vāmanadatta, its Ekāyana author.
