title = "4 iv \\) Conclusions"

It will be useful, at this juncture, to tie together several summary conclusions from the foregoing. Firstly, the idea found in the PārS that three works, namely the SS, PauṣS and JS, are supreme among the Pāñcarātra Saṃhitās is, in the context of the Pāñcarātra corpus *in toto*, a relatively late idea, probably no earlier than the twelfth century, and almost certainly originating in South India. The characterisation of these texts as the “three jewels” \( *ratnatraya*\) is later still, the earliest example being found in a work that is external to the Pāñcarātra scriptural corpus, namely Vedāntadeśika’s PRR, composed in Śrīraṅgam during the first quarter of the fourteenth century. In addition, the absence in the earlier literature of the division of the Pāñcarātra tradition into four Siddhāntas109 suggests that this too is a relatively late innovation, and the earliest extant articulations of this theory succeed several other works which also recognise the existence of distinct groups within the Pāñcarātra.110 Among these we can list at least the *Haravijaya*, Bhaṭṭa Rāmakaṇṭha’s NPP, the SS, the SanS, the JS, a Vaikhānasa work called the *Samūrtārcanādhikaraṇa*, and Yāmuna’s ĀP. The accounts of the different types of Vaiṣṇava or Pāñcarātrika contained in these texts are all markedly different from each other, but it is to be noted that none of them indicate that there was any sectarian animosity between these groups. 

Yāmuna’s ĀP makes no reference to the four Pāñcarātra Siddhāntas, and is certainly less “sectarian” in tone than sections of the PādS which I have addressed above. As Neevel \(1977: 35-36\) suggests, Yāmuna was very likely himself a member of a Pāñcarātra tradition that performed both Pāñcarātrika and Vedic rites. His inclusion of the followers of the Ekāyanaśākhā within the broad class of Bhāgavata Brahmins whom he is defending can possibly be explained by the fact that these Ekāyanas enjoyed a prominent position at the Raṅganāthasvāmin temple in Śrīraṅgam 109 This is based on the assumption that the passage dealing with the four Siddhāntas in the *Hayagrīvasaṃhitā* \(or the *Hayaśīrṣapañcarātra*\) that is quoted by Vedāntadeśika \(PRR 8.5-8\) was a late interpolation into that text. 

[^110]: The earliest extant “articulation” of the theory of four Pāñcarātra Siddhāntas may well occur in the section of the PauṣS \(38.295-39.39\) which Smith \(1975: 296\) has identified as a late interpolation. 

Dating the inclusion of this section within the PauṣS is no easy task, but I am assuming that it came after Yāmuna’s composition of the ĀP on the basis that both events probably occurred in Śrīraṅgam, where the PauṣS was in use, and the ĀP makes no mention of the Siddhāntas. [[76]]

at which Yāmuna was an *ācārya*.111 It is clear, at any rate, that Yāmuna did not oppose this tradition. He asserts that its members do not lose their Brahminical status through abandoning the *dharma* of the triple Veda and performing their own life-cycle rites \( *saṃskāra*\),112 and we must assume that he accepted the “non-personal status” or 

“authorlessness” \( *apauruṣeyatvam*\) of the Ekāyanaśākhā, even if he did not, as some scholars have alleged, author the *Kāśmīrāgamaprāmāṇya*, in which this status is purportedly “treated at length.”113 We should also bear in mind that Yāmuna’s chief objective in the ĀP was not to provide a description of the distinguishable “groups” 

within the Pāñcarātra, but to respond convincingly to a number of allegations cast against the orthopraxy of that tradition. By presenting the Pāñcarātra as a homogeneous ritualistic tradition,114 and the designations ‘Bhāgavata’ and 

‘Pañcarātra’ as synonymous, Yāmuna is thereby subsuming the least “orthoprax” 

Pāñcarātrikas \(i.e. the Ekāyanas\) into the most orthoprax or Veda-congruent stream \(the Vājasaneyins or Bhāgavatas\) and, at least until the very end of the ĀP, presenting the latter group as representative of the Pāñcarātra in general. 

The objective of the author of the description of the Siddhāntas in the PādS is different. His delineation of the divisions within the Pāñcarātra is accompanied by a warning against “mixing” \( *sāṅkarya*/ *saṅkara*\) one Siddhānta with another.115 Rastelli \(2006: 186-187\) draws attention to the fact that the warnings against “mixing” 

Siddhāntas which are found in the 19th *adhyāya* s of both the PādS’s Caryāpāda and the PārS are contained within sections of these texts which deal primarily with the rites of reparation \( *prāyaścitta*\). Given that such rites are also prescribed, for instance, in the event of a *tantrasāṅkarya * i.e a “mixing” of *systems*, whether it be Vaikhānasa or Pāśupata \(PārS 19.520, 549\), the term “sectarianism” does not seem too out of place in a discussion of the Pāñcarātra Siddhāntas of this period. Indeed, the PādS \( *cp* 111 Rastelli \(2006\) has shown that the partially Ekāyana PauṣS was in use at this temple, and that the PārS, an Ekāyana work, was very probably composed here. 

[^112]: ĀP 169.7-10: *ye punaḥ sāvitryanuvacanaprabhṛtitrayīdharmatyāgena ekāyanaśrutivihitān eva cattvāriṃśat saṃskārān kurvate te ’pi svaśākhāgṛhyoktam arthaṃ yathāvad anutiṣṭhamānāḥ na śākhāntarīyakarmānanuṣṭhānād brāhmaṇyāt pracyavante.*

[^113]: Yāmuna gives no clear indication in the ĀP that he authored this work. See ĀP 170.7-9: *yathā ca ekāyanaśākhāyā apauruṣeyatvaṃ tathā kāśmīrāgamaprāmāṇya eva prapañcitam iti*. 

[^114]: See, for example, Yāmuna’s claim \(at ĀP 115.8-116.1\) that “Mutual conflict between the 

\[Pañcarātra\] Tantras… does not exist” \( *parasparavipratiṣedhas tu*… *tantrāṇāṃ nāsty eva*\). 

[^115]: See especially PādS *jp* 1.84-85, *cp* 19.123 *ff*, and also *cp * 21.73c *ff*. [[77]]

19.125c *ff*\) explicitly states the equivalence between a *siddhāntasaṅkara* and a *tantrasaṅkara*. 

However, as we have seen, the warning against the mixing of Siddhāntas \(intended presumably solely for the benefit of Pāñcarātrika adepts\), and the descriptions of the divisions themselves, are presented in the PādS as we now possess it alongside a number of passages \(intended perhaps for the Pāñcarātra’s opponents as well\), in which these divisions are transcended, and in which the Pāñcarātra is shown to be a single, homogeneous tradition in a manner comparable to the “tradition” of the Veda. Of course, this depiction of a unified tradition with distinct branches is able to account for internal inconsistencies in the scriptural literature. The depiction of unity is aided in the PādS, as it is in several later Saṃhitās, via the presentation of a 

“Pāñcarātra canon”, and it is this theme, alongside that of the classification of a hierarchy of scriptures, to which I turn next. [[78]]
