title = "03 The Poem"

+++





The original impetus for this study was Tirumangai’s poem about the Parameccuravinnagaram \(*PT* 2.9\). His unique division between God in the first two lines of the stanza and emperor in the second two, and the complementary unique division in the temple between God as the vimana and king in the dynastic history on the prakara wall form the germ of this extended project. This chapter focuses on the poem, and the next chapter on Nandivarman Pallavamalla’s career. These two will prepare us for the Vishnu-house itself.

In order to demonstrate the poem’s structure I have translated its ten stanzas with attention to their thematic sequence and their liturgical, iconic, and historical meanings. \(The Tamil original may be found in Appendix 5.\) I am not a poet and have not tried to replicate Tirumangai’s poetic aesthetics. The notes in the right-hand column identifying the stanzas are not in the original, but are added for the sake of clarity in our later discussion. I provide a gloss for each stanza to clarify details of meaning and translation. Finally, the name Kanchi also has the form Kacci, and I have retained Tirumangai’s use of the latter. He signs his name with the title Kalikanri, which means “He puts down Kali with a mighty hand.” This title most likely refers to his skillful generation of bhakti in this dark Kali Yuga by means of poems crafted of refined pure Tamil.


STANZA ONE





*Bottom-Floor Sanctum*

The Speaker is the substance



Of the words He speaks,

*Narayana emanates*

Is Taste, Touch, Speech, Smell, and Sight,

*his subtle body*,

Is auspicious Hara, Is Naranan,

*rules Shiva and Brahma*

Is Brahma with four faces



And Kacci, beautiful in the rich expanse

*and dwells in Kanchi*

Of her realm, is His place,

*as black stone icon sitting in the sanctum*,

There where its many subjects shout

*Nandivarman is*

“The Ruler of Pallavas\!”

*acclaimed* Pallavan

“The Ruler of Cheras\!”

*and* Villavan

And numerous kings prostrate

*as subordinate rulers*

To the victory anklet of this

*acknowledge his imperial*

Pallava Lord of noble Mallas

*status, and Pallavamalla builds a*

Who built the Emperor’s Vishnu-house

*a residence for his*

To be His home.

*Master*.


Kalikanri begins by connecting the Bhagavan’s status as Supreme Ruler to Nandivarman’s Bhagavata status as Supreme Ruler. This connection continues throughout the poem to express Kalikanri’s belief that his emperor rules righteously as the consecrated slave representing the Bhagavan. I have kept Kalikanri’s word order in the phrase, “is auspicious Hara, is Naranan, is Brahma with four faces,” because this order replicates the depictions of Vasudeva’s three vyuha formations on the bottom-floor sanctum. The Plower facing north, the Pre-eminently Mighty facing east, and the Unobstructed facing south each has smaller depictions of Shiva to His left and Brahma with four faces to His right. God’s larger central position means He is the underlying cause and controller of the other two. Kalikanri’s use of Naranan for Narayana may reflect his ritual class satus \(*varna*\). When, through diksha consecration, Shudras receive the eight-syllable mantra, *Om namo narayanaya*, they are to recite it with only seven syllables, that is, *Om namo narayana*. This may be one reason he uses Naranan rather than Narayan. Tirumangai records Nandivarman’s personal name, Pallavamalla, with the words “Pallava Lord of noble Mallas.”


STANZA TWO



The vast Sky forever black,

*Narayana is Krishna*

The Lights of Sun and Moon,

*who sustains the cosmos*

The Earth and her Mountains

*in the lotus at His*

All continue at the navel

*navel*,

Of Kannan with the Lotus Eyes,

Whose place is splendid Kacci

With her tall surrounding walls,

Where the Owner of the

Hard Stone and strong Bow that scorched the valor of the Southern King steady in chariots during a battle on enemy ground

*the emperor’s Krishna icon stands in the top sanctum to embody the tejas that defeated the Pandyan’s alliance*.

Continues as Pallava Sovereign



Here on earth where he built



The Emperor’s Vishnu-house.




Kalikanri uses *kannan* as a double entendre: “he has eyes” and “Krishna” \(from the Prakrit *kanha*\). I have translated both meanings. “Hard stone” and “strong bow” translate *tinchilai*, another double entendre. *Chilai* means “bow” and, as the Sanskrit *shila*, means “stone.” In Tamil, *shila/chilai* may denote an icon carved of stone, in this case black stone. This hard black stone icon identifies Kannan of the stanza’s first half with Krishna as the black stone icon that originally stood in the top-floor sanctum of the vimana. It embodied the scorching tejas of the strong bow believed to have caused the defeat of the Pandya alliance. A scene carved on the prakara walkway illustrates this doctrine and will be discussed in chapter 4.


STANZA THREE





*Middle-Floor Sanctum*

In a time long ago



He lay down on a soft sturdy bed,

*Naraynna reclining on the*

An immense shape in the Ocean

*Snake in primordial waters*

The color of black gem

*sleeps in the sanctum as a*

Who gives boons here in Kacci

*black stone icon*,

With a necklace of villas



Belonging to the Pallava Sovereign



Who built the Emperor’s Vishnu-house



after those amassed in Mannai

*Nandivarman receives the boon*

with spears hankering for flesh

*of burning tejas to defeat an*

on their long mouths

*alliance at Netuvayil*.

fell apart early in battle



one day at Netuvayil



from his red-hot heat.




I have translated both meanings of the word *netuvayil;* it is a place name that also means “in the long mouth.” According to the Velvikkudi and Sinnamannur copper plates, the Pallavas and Pandyas fought at Mannai and Netuvayil \(Gopalan 1928: 120–124\). According to T. V. Mahalingam, all the battles in these copper plates were fought before Nandivarman’s thirty-third year of reign \(ca. 764; Mahalingam 1969:159, 178\). He argues that Mannai was in the Bangalore district and was the Rashtrakuta capital of Ganga territory. The Velvikkudi copper plates name Netuvayil along with a place called Man-nikkuricchi, which may correspond to the Mannaikuti named in the Udayendiram copper plates of ca. 757, and to Kalikanri’s Mannai in this stanza. The phrase “from his red-hot heat” is my translation of *parantavan*, a Tamil title; derived from the Sanskrit *paramtapas*, it means “he possesses the supreme heat that defeats another.”


STANZA FOUR



The cosmos and its eight directions,

*In order to beget*

Earth with her billowing waters

*a new cosmos Narayana*

Along with sky, fire, wind and such,

*ate the old one through*

My Father ate,

*fire and it became a*

The Lord whose place is Kacci,

*lotus blossom closed*

Brilliant from the glowing light

*at His navel as He sleeps*,

On each mansion floor,



There in the Vishnu-house



Which the emperor built

*Rebels clustered in the*

After a battle long ago

*lotus formation*

When the lotus formed by the rebels

*flee Nandivarman’s*

Suddenly fell apart

*attacking forces*.

As they fled his sweeping anger.




“Lotus formation” translates *intaikkulam* as “lotus” \(*intai*\) and “an assembled group” \(*kulam*\). “The Lotus” is a name for a specific battle formation attributed to Shiva’s son Skanda. Tirumangai uses it to link Narayana’s destruction of the previous cosmos in order to beget a new one with his emperor’s routing of the rebel forces in order to begin a new imperial rule.


STANZA FIVE



The elephant’s arm is a hollow tube

*Hari rescues Gajendra as depicted at the*

And his leg is thick and sturdy,

*western corner of the*

But it hurt badly until

*sanctum’s north-facing wall*,

He cured it, He who



Plunged one day into

*Gopala Krishna dances on the*

A pool of blooming flowers

*the snake Kaliya as depicted*

To scare the snake in its water,

*at the eastern corner of*

He whose place is beautiful Kacci

*the same wall*,

Encircled by cooling ponds,



There in the Emperor’s Vishnu-house



Built by the Sovereign of Pallavas



after the day he marched

*Nandivarman’s forces take*

at the head of battle

*control of Pampurnatu, the*

with Cobra in hand

*region of Nandipuram near*

to astonish the Southern King

*modern Kumhhakonam*,

of fragrant groves

*and banish the coalition*

and rampart walls high as mountains.

*led by the Pandyan*.


Although “with Cobra in hand” could mean that Nandivarman’s troops carried a cobra banner into battle,1 it more likely means that he had regained control of Pampurnatu, “Country of Cobra Village” \(*pambu-ur-natu*\), referred to here simply as Cobra \(*pampu*\). Pampurnatu is an ancient name for the region of modern Kumbhakonam in the Kaveri delta, the location of Nandivarman’s subcapital called Nandi’s Town, or Nandipuram.2 The Pandyan Maravarma Rajasimha supported Nandivarman’s rival kinsman, whom he called Chitramaya Pallavaraja, and Chitramaya beseiged him in Nandipuram. But when Nandivarman’s general, Udayachandra, killed Chitramaya with his sword he routed the rebel forces, to the Pandyan’s astonishment, Tirumangai says. The tall rampart walls surrounding the Pandyan’s capital of Maturai continues this cobra theme, for at the time Maturai was also known as Alavay, “mouth of poison,” which refers to a snake coiled with its tail in its mouth to indicate Maturai’s boundaries \(Shulman 1980: 122–131\).


STANZA SIX



One day, in the shape of a lion

*Man-lion seizes the asura king*

With nails sharp as diamond,

*Hiranyakashipu as depicted*

The Lord fighting the Valorous

*in Panel 8 of this north-facing*

One

*side, and Panel 9 depicts*

Clawed his waist and tore it open,

*Man-lion ripping him open at*

And in beautiful Kacci

*his navel*;

Encircled by mansions



He has His place,



The Vishnu-house which the Emperor serves,



The Sovereign who rules the Pallavas



In the shade of his White Umbrella

*Nandivarman rules righteously*

after he raised

*because of the tejas embodied*

the Spear and Banner

*by the khatvanga, carried into*

of the khatvanga

*battle, the staff Goddess Kali*

spine of bones

*holds when she emerges as*

high above the army.

*anger from the forehead of*



*Goddess Durga*.


“Serves” translates *paninta* in the phrase repeated at the end of each of the first nine stanzas: *paninta parameccuravinnagaram. Paninta* refers both to building and to serving.

The khatvanga is an implement important in Tantra rites, and Tirumangai says Nandivarman’s army used it to defeat his opponents. Like the spine, it is a column topped by a skull. Goddess Kali holds it when she emerges from the forehead of Goddess Chandika Durga to embody her anger \(*DM* 7.5–7 in Coburn 1991\). According to the tenth label of the inscription on the prakara’s southern side discussed in the next chapter, Pallavamalla formally viewed this khatvanga at his unction as Nandivarman. Tirumangai appears to refer to it as a “banner resembling the spinal column raised on a spear.”

The phrase I translate as “the banner of the khatvanga spine of bones” is *vitaval-koti-verpatal*. C. Minakshi interprets *vita* to be *vitai* \(bull\) and translates the phrase to mean “triumphant bull-banner and the spear weapon” \(Minakshi 1977: 55\). I prefer to keep the word unchanged. Two words in this phrase are clear: *verpatai* commonly means “spear weapon” and *koti* commonly means “banner,” “flag,” “standard,” and “streamer.” The problem is the meaning of *vitavel* composed *of vita* and *vel*. As a verb, *vel* means “to conquer,” “to destroy,” and “to resemble.” As a noun, *vita* from *vitam* means poison \(*visha*\). But it can also be a form of vittam, which the *Tamil Lexicon* says means “crossbeam,” “anything put across,” and “the body”; and it cites Tirumular’s use of the word in *Tirumantiram* 2904.

But according to the explanation of this stanza of the *Tirumantiram* by P. Iramanata Pillai and A. Citamparanar \(which is number 2863 in their edition\), *vittam* does not mean body but the sushumna column in the subtle body. This is important, because the sushumna column in the subtle body runs parallel to the spinal column in the gross body and may be represented by it. See the comments by P. Iramanata Pillai and A. Citamparanar on *Tirumantiram muvayiram:* 2863 in Tirumala Nayanar 1980: 1192–1193. For a discussion of the khatvanga that explains the Tamil Lexicon’s definition of *vittam*, see Wayman 1973: 122–126.


STANZA SEVEN



One day, when Great Bali

*Vamana the Dwarf at Bali’s*

Of the tall glittering crown

*horse sacrifice, as depicted*

Sponsored a great sacrifice,

*in Panel SP2 on the*

He took a dwarf’s shape,

*porch’s south side, receives*

And when water poured out

*Bali’s gift of three steps of*

To seal the gift

*land; as depicted in the next*

Swindled him of this vast world—

*panel on the sanctuary*

His place is Kacci blazing in all

\(*Panel 15*\), *he steps above*

Directions with Agni’s flaming mouths,

*heaven as Trivikrama, the Thrice-strider;*

There in the Vishnu-house



The Emperor built



After he proclaimed victory

*Nandivarman’s alliance*

For his many troops

*threatened both the Pandyan*

And shook the King of the South

*of Madurai and the Cheran*

who rules the world,

*of Karur, a durga fortress*

And Karur of the Virgin’s

*protected by the virgin*

Tall rampart wall.

*Goddess Durga*.


Tirumangai connects Dwarf swindling Bali of his world to Nandivarman taking the Pandyan’s world through battle. Bali’s ritual gift \(*dana*\) is finalized when he pours water over Dwarf’s hand. Tirumangai refers to this rite by chalamotu, “with water,” using *chalam* as the Sanskrit *jala*. But *chalam* also means “deceit,” and the poet intends this meaning too, so I have translated *chalamotu* to mean both “with water” and “with deceit.” *Kanni* or “virgin” refers to Goddess Chandika Durga in the *Devi Mahatmya*, and through her to Karur as a durga, which is a fortress or fortified town. Her virgin status means her tejas is intensely “hot,” not yet “cooled” by marriage to Shiva.


STANZA EIGHT



Once a King of vigor

*Kalikanri Tirumangai returns to the*

With the Umbrella of a hero

*side facing north, where the second*

And an army of monkeys

*panel depicts Rama with Lakshmana*

Blocked the sea with mountains—

*confronting Ocean who obstructs*

He is my Father the Lord

*their crossing to Lanka;*

Whose place in beautiful Kacci



Ringed by ornate halls



Is the Emperor’s Vishnu-house



Served by the Sovereign of Pallavas



who seized the Spear of War

*Nandivarman at Nenmeli gains*

in his right hand

*sovereignty over the Cheran*,

and with the power of an army

*whose Bow emblem gives him the*

frightened in Nenmeli

*title Villavan, “Owner of the*

the virile Villavan bull,

*Bow,” appearing as his title*

the Cheran who owns the Bow.

*in the first stanza*.


Rama son of Dasharatha with his brother Lakshmana angrily confronted Ocean on his way to Lanka to slay Ravana. Only after Ocean’s submission did he build the bridge to Lanka and kill its king. Tirumangai links this event to Nandivarman’s subjugation of Chera opponents, whose capital is Karur of the previous stanza. This explains the acclamation of Nandivarman Pallavamalla as Owner of the Bow \(*villavan*\) in stanza one and brings us full circle to his status as enthroned emperor.

Tirumangai returns to the northern wall for the depiction of Rama to end his listing of Nandivarman’s victories. He does this, as we shall see in later chapters, because the story of Rama’s angry encounter with Ocean illustrated by this panel represents the acharya’s continuing discipline of the devotee consecrated as a Bhagavata. After his diksha consecration, a ritual rebirth, he will sustain a dependent relation to his acharya as if the latter were his father and mother combined in one person. As a Bhagavata ruler, Nandivarman depended on his acharya to conduct liturgical matters on his behalf, including the liturgies that brought about all the victories concluded by this stanza. Rama confronting Ocean and then crossing to Lanka represents his acharya; the source of his acharya’s liturgical success, however, is Krishna, and he appears in the next stanza.


STANZA NINE





*Top-Floor Sanctum*

Pinnai’s forehead is a

*Gopala Krishna subdues Lust*

Gleaming crescent moon

*\(Mal\) disguised as seven bulls to*

And she’s a cousin,

*win Pinnai as his bride, for she*

So long ago in battle

*is his cousin-to-be-married; he*

He subdued deceiving Lust

*stands as the black stone icon*

In the shape of seven bulls,

*inside the sanctum;*

And now owns beautiful Kacci



With its surrounding wealth



Where the Sovereign of Pallavas

*Nandivarman rules as Emperor*

Serves the Vishnu-house he built

*possessing the Drum and Conch*

after he conquered those

*employed during the battles*

angry kings with swords

*whose victory established*

stained black from blood

*his imperial status*.

As the Emperor who owns



The Drum with a bitter mouth



And the Conch with the roar of the sea.




Tirumangai regards the enemies Nandivarman defeated as motivated by the demonic Lust \(Mal\) slain by Krishna in order to gain Pinnai as his bride. The word *mal* as *mahat* denotes greatness and is used for the Bhagavan; as derived from the verb *mal*, “to be confused, perturbed,” *mal* denotes illusion, desire, lust, and blackness, and is used for Krishna and for the demonic lust he defeated. The seven bull shapes this Lust took parallels the “seven battles and more” noted in records of these events on copper plates. Krishna standing as a black stone icon in the top-floor sanctum, Tirumangai tells us, defeated those lusting for the throne of his imperial slave through his royal drum and conch sounded during rites of battle. Both drum and conch, like the khatvanga, were formally displayed to Pallavamalla when he received unction as Kanchipuram’s ruler ca. 731. The supervisor of these rites was his acharya, represented by Rama confronting Ocean in the previous stanza.


STANZA TEN



The Pallavas’ Sovereign of ancient fame



Lives long in the land,



The Emperor who built the Vishnu-house



Well described by Kalikanri,

*The poet identifies himself as*

Ruler of Mangai’s people and her

*ruling Mangai in the*

Vast fields of abundant paddy,

*paddy-rich delta of the*



*Kaveri River*,

In this rich and beautiful garland

*a skillful poet in Tamil*

Of Tamil purity whose skillful

*whose poem embodies shakti*,

singers

*and will bring its devout*

\(By the grace of our Great Goddess Shri\)

*reciter to Vaikuntha on*

*White Island in the Ocean*

Shall rule with brilliance in that shining World

*of Milk, where the devotee shall*

Of abundant water surrounded by the Ocean

*rule, like Hari red with Hari’s shape*.

Which thunders like the roaring chariots



Of the kings who rule this world.




In this signature stanza the poet gives his title, his social identity, and the fruit of skillfully devout singing of his poem composed in a “pure” Tamil embodying shakti in the manner of a mantra. The fruit is eventual residence on White Island in the Ocean of Milk. This is emancipation known as salokya, “dwelling with God in His realm.” The emancipated one will there be a ruler resembling God and greatly superior to righteous rulers on earth, including Nandivarman Pallavamalla. This is the fruit Krishna promises to anyone who does what Nandivarman did in building him a Vishnu-house. In this final stanza Tirumangai implies that Nandivarman will eventually receive this fruit. He also implies that the drainage moat surrounding the Vishnu-house is filled with water, that it is the Ocean of Milk, and that the vimana in its midst is Vaikuntha on White Island. The black stone icon sitting inside is therefore Vaikuntha Perumal.
