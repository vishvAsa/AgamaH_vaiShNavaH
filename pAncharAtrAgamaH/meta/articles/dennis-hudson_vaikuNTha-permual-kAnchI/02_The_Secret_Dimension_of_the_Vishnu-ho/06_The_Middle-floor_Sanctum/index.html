  <p><em><strong>The Sculpted Program of the Northern Path</strong></em></p>
<p>Let us now turn to the sanctum on the middle floor of the Vishnu-house. To gain access, visitors climb the southern staircase inside the vimana leading into its small porch; they descend by way of the corresponding northern staircase. The porch doorway opens into an open-air verandah formed by the roof of the much larger porch below. The sides of the vimana below extend upward to create a low wall enclosing the entire middle story.</p>
<p>The two axes of the mandala organize the sanctum’s visual symmetry. On each side an opening in the center marks the place of the vyuha formation depicted on the sanctum below (the porch doorway is the central opening on the western side). Panels are evenly arrayed on both sides of this center: two sets of three on the northern and southern sides, and two sets of two on the western and eastern sides. Slits on each side of the central window on the northern, eastern, and southern sides provide additional light for the two stairways inside.</p>
<p>The two northern and southern panels immediately adjacent to the central windows along the north-south axis are set apart in design from the others, and are wider. They denote one or the other of the two bhagas belonging to the vyuha formation the side represents (jnana and bala for the side facing north; shakti and tejas for the side facing south). On the eastern wall the two panels adjacent to the central window are not set apart by design, but nevertheless denote its formation’s two bhagas (aishvarya and virya) by a width greater than the panels at the corners. There are altogether twenty-four sculpted panels on the sanctum and porch (excluding the figures on the porch face), and they give particular attention to stories found in Books 6–10 of the <em>Bhagavata Purana</em>, and especially to the Krishna Story (<em>Krishnakatha</em>) in Book 10.</p>
<p>Viewers standing on the verandah at a distance from the porch and sanctum have a sweeping view of the entire western face of the sanctum. The sculpted panels on the northern and southern sides of the porch cannot be seen, however, for they come into view only when walking the narrow path formed by the low wall on one side and the sanctum on the other. Likewise, sculpted panels facing north, east, and south on this sanctum can only be seen up close and one at a time.</p>
<p>The center of the western side is the doorway in the porch. Three figures on the face of the porch stand on each side. The set of three sculpted figures shown in Figure 6.1 is north of the porch doorway, which is to the right. A similar set is to the south of the doorway. Here a male guardian, dvarapala, stands peacefully adjacent to the entrance. He wears a tall crown, holds an unidentified object in his left hand, and rests his right hand on his hip. To his right stands a female in a gracefully relaxed pose. To her right stands a male wearing a tall crown, his hair emerging beneath it at the sides, suggesting recent vigorous motion. He gestures upward with his right hand in the direction of the northern sequence of panels. The set south of the doorway mirrors this arrangement; the two females probably depict the Ganga and Yamuna rivers as persons, reminders that this doorway to the sanctum opens towards the dark waters of Brahma’s nighttime where the reclining icon sleeps inside the sanctum.</p>

<h2 id="the-two-paths"><strong>The Two Paths</strong></h2>
<p>The next panels in sight on this western side are on the sanctum. They consist of one pair north of the porch and one pair south of the porch. These pairs reveal that, in contrast to the sanctum below, this sanctum’s sculpted program consists of two sequences running parallel, west to east. As illustrated by Figure 6.2, both sequences begin on one side of the porch and end on the sanctum’s eastern side with a panel adjacent to its central window.</p>
<p>FIGURE 6.2. The two paths of the middle-floor sanctum. Drawing by Case and Sandgren.</p>
<p>How are we to understand this arrangement? What are the differences between these sculpted sequences, and why are they in parallel directions? Why don’t all the panels form a continuous program in the clockwise directions of circumambulation? The beginning of an answer is offered in the story of Vamana the Dwarf and the asura king Bali, illustrated by southern path panels 14–16. Panel 14 introduces the Bhagavan as Vamana at Bali’s horse sacrifice, Panel 15 depicts Vamana taking three strides while Garuda binds Bali as a victim of his own sacrifice, and Panel 16 illustrates the fulfillment of Vamana’s promise to Bali after he became a devoted refugee.</p>
<p>Vamana promised to guard Bali and his family in Sutala and to keep them from the defilement inherent to underworld waters and to asuras. When Bali’s grandfather Prahlada overheard this promise he was astonished and said to Vamana: “Brahma and other devas are mighty because of [the path called] ‘Approaching the Honey of the Lotus Feet.’ But Granter of Refuge! We are asuras of wicked ways and vile wombs—why do you graciously bring us to the ‘Path of the Southern Doctrine?’ You are indeed like the Wishing Tree, for you give equally to everyone who asks” (<em>BP</em> 8.23.7).</p>
<p>The two paths Prahlada names appear to correspond to the two sculpted sequences of this sanctum. He identifies the first path as appropriate to “Brahma and other devas.” Translated into the fourfold ritual class system of varnas, these devas signify males born of wombs inherently “pure” and therefore qualified for consecration to the Vedas as dvija or “twice-born.” “Brahma” denotes Brahmins, and “other devas” led by Indra denote Kshatriyas, and to a lesser extent Vaishyas. These consecrated males are qualified to walk the path called Approaching the Honey of the Lotus Feet (<em>Padapadma-makarandanishevana</em>) with the guidance of appropriate Brahmins. The panels of the northern sequence document this path; it leads to the perception of Vasudeva Krishna as one’s master and virya action as His slave or servant.</p>
<p>Prahlada identifies the second path as appropriate to “we asuras of wicked ways and vile wombs.” By “we” Prahlada means asura kings like him and his grandson Bali. Translated into the terms of ritual class, they signify rulers who are Shudras; and according to Bhagavata Dharma virtually all rulers in the Kali Yuga are Shudras or barbarians. As Shudras, they are born of wombs inherently “impure” and therefore not qualified for consecration to the Vedas and dvija status; and their customs are “impure,” for they practice cross-cousin marriage, drink alcohol, and worship yakshas, rakshasas, and asuras. Yet the Pancharatra Agama cleanses them of their inherent “impurity” through its Man-lion Consecration (<em>nrisimha-diksha</em>), which Vasudeva teaches to Samkarshana in the <em>Satvata-samhita</em> (<em>SS</em> 17). This powerful purifying diksha is open to Shudras, women, and all others. Once purified, its sadhakas are analogous to the “twice-born” and have access to the path of Approaching the Honey of the Lotus Feet, but without its Vedic mantras such as <em>Om</em>. Bhagavata Shudras who are rulers are analogous to Prahlada and Bali, and they have further access to the Path of the Southern Doctrine, as Prahlada observes.</p>
<p>The two sequences of this middle-floor sanctum document the ritual career of one such Bhagavata Shudra ruler—Nandivarman Pallavamalla—and use specific events in <em>Bhagavata</em> stories to illustrate his steps along both paths to reach virya action and aishvarya sovereignty (Figure 6.3).</p>

<h2 id="approaching-the-honey-of-the-lotus-feet-sculpted-panels-of-the-northern-path"><strong>“Approaching the Honey of the Lotus Feet”: Sculpted Panels of the Northern Path</strong></h2>
<p>The twelve sculpted panels constituting the northern path move clockwise to depict an “awakening” of consciousness that leads to the perception of Vasudeva Krishna as one’s master. This process of awakening is told through the lore of the <em>Bhagavata Purana</em>, but with allusions to the career of Nandivarman as the paradigmatic devotee. These panels are organized according to the west-east and north-south axes of the mandala, as are those of the southern path. This means that they are <em>not</em> to be read as a continuous narrative sequence. The narratives introduced by the panels on the western side continue with the panels on the eastern side; the six panels in between interrupt these narratives to document stages in the purification of the devotee’s consciousness. Our discussion of the northern path will begin with the narrative (Panels 1–4 and 11–12), and will then turn to purification of consciousness (Panels 5–10).</p>

<h3 id="panel-1-the-murti-padmanabha"><em><strong>Panel 1: The Murti Padmanabha</strong></em></h3>
<p>THE PANEL. The northern path begins with the murti Padmanabha, the eleventh of the twelve interior formations (<em>antarvyuha</em>) discussed in the previous chapter (Figure 6.4). Dressed royally and crowned, he stands with two pairs of arms and faces north. His back pair of hands holds the wheel and conch. He rests his front left hand on his hip, and with his front right hand forms the abhayamudra of protection: his open hand with fingers pointed upward and facing the viewer is held at his chest. The murti Padmanabha’s name refers to the lotus, padma, at his navel, nabha. His position here invokes the Bhagavan inside the sanctum with Brahma’s lotus inside His stomach; as the path begins He offers the protection of refuge or sharana.</p>

<h3 id="panel-2-the-seven-seers"><em><strong>Panel 2: The Seven Seers</strong></em></h3>
<p>THE PANEL. This panel depicts the set of Seven Seers present during each Manu Term (<em>manvantara</em>) (Figure 6.5). A new set of Seven Seers appears in each Manu Term, fourteen of which constitute the largest cycle of time, called a kalpa, or one daytime of Brahma (<em>BP</em> 8.1; 8.5.1–9; 8.13–14). Each Manu Term lasts for seventy-one sets of four ages or yugas (Chatur Yuga) (<em>BP</em> 3.22.36; 3.11.24). We, for example, live during the term of the seventh Manu of this kalpa, who is the “son of Sun” (<em>vaivasvata</em>) named Shraddhadeva (Faith’s Deva); his younger brother, Savarni, will become the next Manu. The events of the Krishnakatha take place during Vaivasvata Shraddhadeva’s term as Manu, and each seer depicted here plays important roles in the stories illustrated on this sanctum and on the floor below. They are named Kashyapa, Atri, Vasishtha, Vishvamitra, Gautama, Jamadagni, and Bharadvaja (<em>BP</em> 8.13.5). After 1,200 deva years most of Veda will have been swallowed by time, but the Seven Seers will recover it through their ascetic self-discipline (<em>tapas</em>) and preserve it for the new set of four yugas. In this manner fourteen sets of Seven Seers sustain eternal Dharma throughout a kalpa (<em>BP</em> 8.14).</p>
<p>FIGURE 6.5. Panel 2: The seven seers or seven rishis. Photo by Sathya Seelan.</p>
<p>The seers dwell above earth and immediately below the pole star, Dhruva, the highest realm visible to the human eye. They circumambulate the base of Vishnu’s transcendent realm (<em>paramapada</em>), which is the entire realm of space-time upward from Dhruva. From earth they appear as the seven stars constituting the Great Bear constellation (Big Dipper) (<em>BP</em> 5.22.17). Here they turn toward the adjacent panel to watch Krishna’s life unfold beneath them on earth.</p>
<p>In the <em>Bhagavata Purana</em>, the narrating Shuka explains their astral modes to the emperor Parikshit. A star or constellation (<em>nakshatra</em>) appears each night in a northwestern line midway between the stars Pulaha and Kratu, who are the two central and dominant seers in the panel. The star or constellation appears there for one hundred human years and then a new star replaces it. Parikshit began his imperial rule when the star Magha was in the middle between Pulaha and Kratu. When the star Purvasadha replaces it the demon Kali will gain in strength, and the son of a Shudra woman will ascend the throne at Magadha. Nanda will be crowned 1,115 years after Parikshit’s birth and will destroy all Kshatriyas (<em>BP</em> 12.1.26–34). Kings will then be Shudras and against Dharma (<em>adharma</em>); gradually society will degenerate (<em>BP</em> 12.1.8–9). Kalki will appear on a white horse to establish a new Krita Yuga when Moon, Sun, and Jupiter conjoin in the same house while Pushya ascends (<em>BP</em> 12.1.12–14). Kalki on his horse appears below in the two panels flanking the porch entrance.</p>
<h3 id="panel-3-ashtabhujasvamin-the-lord-with-eight-arms"><em><strong>Panel 3: Ashtabhujasvamin: The Lord with Eight Arms</strong></em></h3>
<p>The Seven Seers’ gaze leads us to this panel on the north half of sanctum’s west wall. It depicts the murti Damodara, whose name, “has a rope around his waist,” refers to an episode in the Krishnakatha when the child Krishna let Yashoda tie him with a rope to a stone mortar (<em>BP</em> 10.9). He is depicted here as the Lord with Eight Arms, Ashtabhujavamin, who stands victoriously, a vigorous and assertive warrior holding weapons and objects in his eight hands, the counterpart of the meek submission of the previous panel. Moreoever, he complements the striding dwarf with eight arms (<em>vamana trivikrama</em>) depicted in the corresponding place on the sanctum’s south half (see Panel 15).</p>
<p>THE PANEL. This crowned and vigorous figure stands slightly off center in front of a throne (Figure 6.6). His torso and head are straight, and the panel’s vertical axis runs down the left side of his crown and face. He looks forward and slightly to the south. The bottom of his right foot rests on the throne, his knee thrusts to the north, and his right thigh and calf press together ready to spring into action. The perspective allows the viewer to see his entire right foot as if looking down from above. His left leg stretches down to the floor beneath the throne and is straight but slightly diagonal to the axis of his body.</p>
<p>FIGURE 6.6. Panel 3: Damodara as Ashtabhujasvamin: The Lord with Eight Arms (prior to repair). IFDI.</p>
<p>Each arm holds a weapon. On his right side his hand in back holds the wheel. Beneath its elbow an arm holds the handle of the sword he pulls out of a sheath on his lower back. Beneath it an arm holds the mace. His front arm rises straight out from the shoulder and bends upward at the elbow to take an arrow from the quiver on his back. On his left side his hand in back holds the conch. Beneath it a hand holds a shield. The hand beneath the shield has disappeared, but may have held a second quiver, or a noose, or the tusk of an elephant, but most likely a lotus. His front hand, at the level of the right side of his chest, holds a bow near its top; its bottom appears to rest on the floor in front of the throne. The angles of his two front arms express skill in archery.</p>
<p>At the north side of this panel stands a crowned two-armed figure holding the veneration gesture (<em>anjalimudra</em>): the palms of both hands with fingers pointed upward are brought together at the chest. He faces forward, turns slightly to the southwest, and is probably Garuda, who similarly appears in human form in other panels (see for example Panels 5 and 15). Above him in the corner is the small face and torso of a two-armed male. His left arm rises to the side of his face and his open hand bends to the south, with his other hand at the level of his chest. A similar figure may match him in the south corner, for suggestions of arms are visible, but the damage is too great to tell.1</p>
<p>THE PANEL’S MEANINGS. This panel represents the murti Damodara, the last of the twelve interior formations, and it signifies the darkness of late night. It also refers to a standing icon known for his eight arms; in Tamil he is <em>Attapuyakarattan</em> and in Sanskrit he is <em>Ashtabhujasvamin</em>. He stands facing west in a temple that in the eighth century was in Attiyur, a village south of Kanchipuram’s wall and moat. The city envelops it today as “Little Kanchi” or “Vishnu Kanchi.” The eight-armed icon is a powerful refuge, as the poet Pey said in the penultimate stanza of <em>Munran Tiruvantati:</em></p>
<p>Holding all eight weapons,</p>
<p>He is an unvanquished victor,</p>
<p>he who dwells in the house</p>
<p>of the Lord with Eight Arms</p>
<p>For one day,</p>
<p>to slay a tough crocodile</p>
<p>in the pond,</p>
<p>He merely aimed the wheel and flung it—</p>
<p>Our shelter is the sole of his foot.</p>
<p>Hari used his blazing wheel to free the Indra of Elephants (<em>gajendra</em>) from the crocodile of grasping desire as it tried to drown him in the cool waters of married life. The first panel facing north (Panel 5) illustrates this Gajendra story and is discussed in chapter 7.</p>
<p>Finally, this panel represents the first set of ceremonies of the northern path, but with specific reference to Nandivarman’s participation in them at the temple of Attapuyakarattan; these liturgical events were crucial to Nandivarman’s career as Bhagavata emperor. Around 745–746 he received “Consecration to the Man as Lion” (<em>narasimha-diksha</em>) at the feet of the Eight-armed Lord standing in Attiyur. This purified him for the two parts of “Consecration to the Icon” (<em>vibhava-diksha</em>). The first part took place at this temple and its second part at Sri Rangam, and Kalikanri recorded each event with a poem.2 In the first stanza about the Eight-armed Lord he records Nandivarman’s purification through his consecration to Man-lion:</p>
<p>Shiva burned up the wandering Three Cities,</p>
<p>Lord Brahma sits high on a lotus,</p>
<p>And they marvel,</p>
<p>For three worlds roar like waves</p>
<p>Thundering in the great sea</p>
<p>As they properly worship him,</p>
<p>The lion with burning nails and slicing teeth</p>
<p>Who splits Golden’s body into two—</p>
<p>“Who is this person?” I ask,</p>
<p>“I am the one dwelling in the house</p>
<p>Of the Eight-Armed-Lord”</p>
<p>he says.</p>
<p>Golden (<em>hiranyan</em>) represents the sadhaka’s arrogant self-sufficiency derived from an asura-like impurity. Consecration to Man-lion tears the arrogance apart and removes the impurity. We shall discuss this story at length in chapter 8. The voices at the end appear throughout nine of the poem’s ten stanzas. The questioner represents Nandivarman Pallavamalla, who seeks refuge and wonders about each stage in the liturgies. The presiding acharya answers him on behalf of the icon and himself, for the Eight-armed Lord resides in both during the consecrations.</p>
<p>The eight objects held by the icon in Attiyur match those held by the figure sculpted here, if we assume the latter’s missing hand held a lotus. Kalkanri describes these objects in his poem’s third stanza:</p>
<p>Pure gold gleams</p>
<p>As he holds an arrow in his right hand</p>
<p>and a firm bow with a mace,</p>
<p>a conch, and a bright sword,</p>
<p>Yet the vast light of a wheel</p>
<p>with a shield</p>
<p>and a graceful flower</p>
<p>Is brighter, how can this be?</p>
<p>When angry hate raged in that elephant</p>
<p>He threw it with the mere twist</p>
<p>Of one white tusk</p>
<p>And he is black like a cloud—</p>
<p>“Who is this person?” I ask,</p>
<p>“I am the one dwelling in the house</p>
<p>Of the Eight-Armed-Lord”</p>
<p>he says.</p>
<p>The elephant in this case is not Gajendra, but Kamsa’s raging “Chaplet of Blue Waterlilies” (<em>kuvalaya-apida</em>). His name captures Kamsa’s asura nature, because blue waterlilies bloom only at night. After Krishna kills Kuvalayapida he and Balarama take his tusks into Kamsa’s wrestling arena.</p>
<p>This panel is carefully positioned, because Krishna’s slaughter of Kuvalayapida mentioned here begins an episode that concludes with Krishna standing victoriously in the east-facing panel directly opposite (Panel 12). Here Krishna enters the arena with one elephant tusk over his shoulder and there he slays the wrestler Chanura. This eight-armed Damodara murti thus begins a transformation that ends with the Madhava murti standing there.</p>
<h3 id="panel-4-krishna-slays-the-asura-keshin-in-the-shape-of-a-horse"><em><strong>Panel 4: Krishna Slays the Asura Keshin in the Shape of a Horse</strong></em></h3>
<p>THE STORY. Kamsa, who has usurped Mathura’s throne from his father Ugrasena, knows that Vasudeva’s two sons intend to kill him: his son by Devaki together with Rohini, who is Samkarshana Balarama, and his son by Devaki alone, who is Vasudeva Krishna. Narada tells Kamsa that the boys reside in the cowherd settlement of Vraja called Gokula, in the house of the cowherd chieftain Nanda and his wife Yashoda. By birth the boys are Kshatriyas, but they are growing up as if they are cowherd boys or gopas. Having learned this, Kamsa sends various asuras to slay them, but until now the brothers have defeated them all. Kamsa finally sends the asura named Keshin (He Who Has Long Hair), who takes the shape of a huge horse. Keshin attacks Krishna in Gokula, but the boy wins once again: Krishna thrusts his arm down the horse’s throat, expands his arm, and strangles him—and the huge horse splits in two like a karkatika fruit. Narada then appears, praises Krishna for this deed, and predicts further conquests in the future.</p>
<p>After this Kamsa sends Maya’s son Vyoma, whose name means “air,” but more significantly “one who cannot be saved.” Vyoma has great skill with illusions and appears in Gokula disguised as a gopa boy. While the cowherd boys are playing as if they are rams, Vyoma carries them off one by one and locks them up in a mountain cave. But just as a tawny lion (<em>hari</em>) of great power attacks a wolf (<em>vikra</em>), Krishna attacks Vyoma, who now assumes an enormous asura form. But the Unfallen (Achyuta) holds him fast, throws him to the ground, and slays him as one slays the victim in a sacrifice. He then opens the cave, releases the boys, and they all return home (<em>BP</em> 10.36.20–21; 10.37).</p>
<p>With these two events, Krishna’s career as a cowherd growing up in Vraja in the Gokula settlement and the Vrindavan forest comes to an end. The corresponding corner panel on the eastern side portrays the next episode in the brothers’ careers: They leave Gokula for Mathura to live as the Kshatriyas they were born to be.</p>
<p>THE PANEL. Krishna in the center of this panel stands on his left leg placed on a raised platform (Figure 6.7). A tall cone, turban, or crown caps his head. He faces forward and looks down at the horse Keshin facing south, whose head he has seized and pulled up. The horse is left to stand on its hind legs at the bottom of the panel while its front legs dangle in the air. Krishna pushes his right foot down on the middle of the horse’s back, pulls its upper jaw upward with his right hand, and thrusts his left arm down its throat to strangle it. In the upper corners two male figures mirror each other, both with a crown or turban resembling Krishna’s, which suggests they are gopas. The left arm of one and the right arm of the other stretch up in a gesture of victory bracketing Krishna’s crown or turban; with the other hand each forms a damaged mudra at his chest.</p>
<p>FIGURE 6.7. Panel 4: Krishna slays the asura Keshin in the shape of a horse. Photo by Sathya Seelan.</p>
<p>THE PANEL’S MEANINGS. Krishna’s title Keshava refers to this episode; here he represents the murti Keshava, the first of the twelve interior formations. The Keshava murti, like the brahmamuhurta, embodies the potency for a prosperity and longevity worthy of kings, unfolding clockwise around the mandala as murtis, as the divisions of day-and-night, and as stages in a royal sadhana represented by episodes from the <em>Bhagavata Purana</em>. Keshava Krishna begins the circle and Ashatabhujaswami ends it.</p>
<p>This panel corresponds to the month of Margashirsha, to the final hour of night known as Brahma’s hour or brahmamuhurta, and to the “awakening” process that reaches its climax at the northeast corner of sunrise. The six panels on the northern side, which immediately follow this panel, document the stages of this “awakening” during the brahmamuhurta. But we shall leave them for the next chapter.</p>
<p>This episode alludes to two Vedic sacrifices performed for the sake of prosperity and longevity. Most obvious is the ancient horse sacrifice or ashvamedha, which proclaimed its royal sponsor to be the chakravartin, the pivot of the realm depicted as a chakra or wheel. Ruling at its center, he matched the turning of his wheel to Surya’s clockwise turning around the mandala of Earth, thereby gaining prosperity and life. By establishing its royal sponsor as the chakravartin to whom all other rulers are subordinate, the king is declared the supreme ruler or parameshvara, an emperor. Nandivarman received this imperial status as a Bhagavata when the second part of the diksha consecration, which had begun in Attiyur (the previous panel), was completed at Sri Rangam (this panel). Tirumangai recorded those ceremonies in separate poems.</p>
<p>In the ashvamedha, the “king of sacrifices,” the horse is suffocated like other victims, either by keeping its mouth and nose closed or by a noose (<em>SB</em> 3.8.1.15–16; 13.2.2.1). He is then cut up with a golden slaughtering knife (<em>SB</em> 13.2.2.16). But unlike other victims, only the horse’s left side is used for offerings, whereas meat is taken from the right and left sides of other animals.3 This implies that the golden knife literally or conceptually splits the horse into halves, just as Bhima splits Jarasamdha into halves, as we shall see.</p>
<p>The other sacrifice is the ritual context for sacrificing the horse, a ceremony lasting five days. It produces soma, which is a drink then offered to Indra in Heaven, because the king of devas loves soma. Pleasing Indra with libations of soma brings “deathlessness” or amrita to those who live on Earth. But in Heaven soma is “deathlessness” in the form of a drink called amrita; from the last hour of their night to their evening twilight, Indra and Bali, the king of asuras, fight to possess this elixir. And the Bhagavan arranges this context, as we shall see.</p>
<p>After Keshin is dead, the seer Narada appears secretly to tell Krishna that this concludes his cowherd conquests. He foretells the major episodes that will now unfold, beginning with his departure from Gokula in Akrura’s chariot, as depicted directly opposite this panel by Panel 11, facing east. Narada says to Krishna (in my paraphrase):</p>
<p>Krishna, Krishna, unknowable Self, Ruler of Unified Consciousness (<em>yogesha</em>), Ruler of the Moving Universe (<em>jagadishvara</em>), you have descended as leader of Satvatas to destroy Diti’s sons and the tormenting rakshasas who live on earth, and to preserve boundaries (<em>setu</em>). Out of play (<em>lila</em>) you destroyed this son of Diti, and day after tomorrow I will watch you slay Chanura, Mushtika, and the other wrestlers, and the elephant Kuvalayapida and Kamsa. Then I will see you slay the Conch, Yavana, Mura, and Naraka, and take away the Parijata tree after conquering Indra. Later I will see you marry the daughters of warriors through your virya, and free Nriga from sin at Dvaraka. Then I will watch you accept the Syamantaka jewel and Jambavati, and bring the Brahmin’s dead children back from Death, and destroy Paundraka, burn Kashi, and slay Dantavaktra and Shishupala the Chedi king. Whatever other virya deeds you perform while dwelling in Dvaraka I will see, and then I will see you in the chariot of Arjuna in the shape of Time (<em>kalarupa</em>) intent on annihilating armies of men. I prostrate to you who are uninvolved by maya, and who, for the sake of play (<em>kridartha</em>), takes the form of a man to lead the Yadus, Vrishnis, and Satvatas. (<em>BP</em> 10.37.11–24)</p>
<p>Narada’s statement may have been inserted into the Krishnakatha to gloss <em>keshava</em> (having long abundant hair), the man with long and abundant hair who slayed the horse with a long mane.4 Krishna as Ruler of Unified Consciousness, Ruler of the Moving Universe, abode of all things, and leader of Yadus, Vrishnis, and Satvatas expresses Pancharatra doctrine. The Yadus and Vrishnis constitute the set of clans to which Krishna belongs, but the Satvatas are his own clan. <em>Satvata</em> also refers to those who worship in the Satvata way, which is the Pancharatra Agama. Moreover, the Pancharatra scripture known as the <em>Satvata-samhita</em> explains the consecrations represented by the panels on this sanctum facing north, as we shall see in chapters 7 and 8. Finally, <em>keshava</em> is glossed as the murti producing chronological time, just as Keshava produces Krishna’s deeds following his cowherd career.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Kamsa sends one more asura, Vyoma, who steals the playing boys and puts them in a cave. Krishna throws him down and suffocates him like the animal victim (<em>pashumarana</em>) in a sacrifice. What is this Vyoma episode about? We already know that Krishna’s slaughter of Keshin climaxes his career in Gokula, so Vyoma’s slaughter must complete that climactic act in some way. The reference to the cowherds playfully acting like rams (<em>meshaya</em>) and other animals, and Vyoma’s death in the manner of a sacrificial beast, suggest the answer. During the horse sacrifice, the horse is tied with a ram and a gomriga (bovine deer) to a stake (<em>yupa</em>) in front of the eastern ahavaniya fire for offerings. In addition, twelve animals (all but one a goat) are tied around the horse as offerings for specific devas and are sacrificed after the horse (<em>SB</em> 13.2.2.1–11; and note 4, pp. 298–299). This story of Vyoma putting gopas imitating rams and other animals into a closed-up cave as if to suffocate them, and of Krishna then suffocating him “who cannot be saved,” appears to represent the sacrifice of these additional victims to complete the horse sacrifice. This Vyoma episode thus draws a ritual boundary around Krishna’s gopala career, just as another episode draws a similar boundary around his childhood after he defeats Kaliya. We shall discuss it in Chapter 8.</p>
<p>The significance of this Keshava episode is explained by the idea that the horse is the vajra for Kshatriyas. The Master of Progeny assigned other sacrifices to devas, but kept the horse sacrifice for himself; it is a diamond bolt of lightning (<em>vajra</em>) that stamps down his enemy, represented in the ashvamedha by a slain dog plunged into water under the horse’s feet (<em>SB</em> 13.2.1.1; 13.1.2.9). The gandharva king named Chitraratha once told Arjuna that when Indra used his vajra against Vritra, it split into a hundred and ten pieces on Vritra’s head. These pieces then took on differing bodies, so that “Whatever is a means to success in the world is known as an embodiment of the thunderbolt.” The Kshatriya’s steeds embody his vajra. The king’s vajra resembles Indra’s horse, Ucchaishravas, and the horses born of Lakshmi. Chitraratha promised the latter to Arjuna (<em>Mahabharata</em> 1.158.45–50; van Buitenen 1: 322).</p>
<p>Krishna’s slaughter of Keshin eliminates Kamsa’s means to success, and it could not be otherwise, for Krishna tells Arjuna, “Of weapons I am the vajra” (<em>BG</em> 10.28). Kamsa’s horse vajra is gone, and his elephant emblem as an Indra of Men is about to fall.</p>
<p>This story in the Krishnakatha leads directly into Krishna’s departure for Mathura (<em>BP</em> 10.37–38). These two stories are depicted along the west-east axis, the first here and the second on the corresponding corner panel facing east. To continue, therefore, we must skip the intervening panels facing north and turn directly to the first panel on the east. Figure 6.8 illustrates the pattern.</p>

<h3 id="panel-11-krishna-addresses-the-gopis-from-akruras-chariot"><em><strong>Panel 11: Krishna Addresses the Gopis from Akrura’s Chariot</strong></em></h3>
<p>THE STORY. Krishna and Balarama have by now destroyed everyone whom Kamsa had sent to slay them, and Kamsa is of course enraged. He puts Vasudeva and Devaki in shackles and devises plans to kill the brothers in Mathura. He tells his companions Chanura and Mushtika to pretend to be wrestlers and kill Krishna and Balarama in a public match. He tells his best elephant keeper to station the royal elephant Kuvalayapida at the entrance to the wrestling arena and kill them there. And he orders the Bow Sacrifice or Danuryaga to begin on the fourteenth day, and the animals desired by Rudra Shiva, the Most Bountiful King of Bhutas, sacrificed to him.</p>
<p>Kamsa then summons Akrura, a Yadu leader and a relative of Krishna, who among Vrishnis and Bhojas is famous for acting in the best interest of others. Kamsa receives him with friendly warmth, and asks for a favor. “I know that devas have taken refuge with Vaikuntha and are seeking my death. Go to Nanda’s Vraja and bring Balarama and Krishna to Mathura along with Nanda and the gopas with their tribute. Use as an excuse the Bow Sacrifice and the sights of the city. Once they are there either the royal elephant or wrestlers will kill them. I shall then get rid of all my enemies: Vasudeva and the other leaders of the Vrishnis, Bhojas, Dasharhas, my father Ugrasena and my brother Devaka, and finally everyone else. My guru is my father-in-law, Jarasandha of Magadha, and my friends are Dvivida, Shambara, Naraka, and Bana. Once we have eliminated all kings who side with devas, I shall enjoy Earth just as I please” (<em>BP</em> 10.36.28–37).</p>
<p>Akrura responds carefully. He commends Kamsa for seeking to overcome obstacles, as a king should. Yet whether one succeeds or fails, one should be the same, he observes, for results come through fate (<em>daiva</em>). If fate thwarts anyone intent on getting what he wants, without fail the pain of joy and sorrow has him in its grip. “Nevertheless, I shall carry out your command” (<em>BP</em> 10.36.16–39).</p>
<p>The next morning Akrura sets out for Gokula, joyously anticipating the sight of the Bhagavan Krishna, and reaches there at sunset. Balarama and Krishna receive him graciously, and he tells them all about Kamsa’s plans. At sunrise the next morning they are ready to leave and the gopis are devastated. Weeping and crying, “Krishna! Govinda! Damodara! Madhava!” they approach Akrura’s chariot, but he starts it moving, and Nanda and the others in carts filled with tributes of milk for the king follow behind. The gopis pursue Krishna, who is in Akrura’s chariot, longing for him to reply to their pleas, but “I shall return” is all he says. They watch him until they can no longer see the chariot, and return home without any hope that Govinda will return. Yet day and night they sing of him and his acts, and in so doing live free of sorrow (<em>BP</em> 10.38–39.37).</p>
<p>THE PANEL. Krishna is depicted standing in the chariot with Balarama to his left and Akrura to his right (Figure 6.9). Akrura stands respectfully with arms crossed. The man gazing from behind between the heads of Krishna and Akrura appears to be Nanda in an adjacent cart. Krishna has one pair of arms; his left hand rests at his waist and his right hand forms a damaged mudra gesture. The chariot is represented beneath by one wheel, and by the horse rearing up with early-morning energy, facing south toward Mathura. The two figures above this scene remain unidentified.</p>
<p>FIGURE 6.9. Panel 11: Krishna addresses the gopis from Akrura’s chariot. Photo by Sathya Seelan.</p>
<p>The location of this panel facing east at the northeast corner illustrates the moment after sunrise when Krishna turns to face the women he has entranced through his beauty, his heroic deeds, and his love. This begins the gopis’ clinging to Krishna in separation (<em>viraha bhakti</em>). Their pure or sattvika clinging is what the sadhaka experiences when “awake.” According to Kalikanri, Nandivarman tasted this gopi viraha bhakti during his consecration at the feet of the Eight-armed Lord in Attiyur. When stunningly beautiful women took over his mind he looked at the Eight-armed Lord through new eyes:</p>
<p>“However we think about his complexion,</p>
<p>Still we know nothing,” they say</p>
<p>As their bangles,</p>
<p>Their minds,</p>
<p>And all their fullness</p>
<p>Enter to become my mind,</p>
<p>“Who is this person like a cloud</p>
<p>Wearing the black of the boiling sea,</p>
<p>The purple of the bilberry,</p>
<p>And the dark blue of the lily</p>
<p>Blossoming with time?”</p>
<p>they ask,</p>
<p>“I am the one dwelling in the house</p>
<p>Of the Eight-Armed-Lord”</p>
<p>he says [6]</p>
<p>Kalikanri plays on the double meaning of <em>vannam/varna</em> as “color” and “nature.” Krishna’s dark color hides his true complexion from these lovers ardently desiring to know him. Nandivarman’s transformed consciousness now longs for the Supreme Male, but he remains as impenetrable as the dazzling black cloud these gopis cannot understand.</p>
<p>THE PANEL’S MEANINGS. All attention in the panel is on Krishna at sunrise, the cause of the gopis’ weeping; the viewer stands in their place as they hear him say, “I shall return.” Krishna is the content of jnana or knowledge, and the gopis therefore “see” him day and night by means of their pure longing. Krishna thus fulfills his promise to return, for Madhava is with them in Gokula even while he is away in Mathura. Moreover, this gopi perception of Krishna’s presence in his absence represents the consecrated devotee’s consciousness fully “awake” as a result of the sadhana inaugurated by the diksha, whose completion is represented by the Keshava panel opposite to this on the western side.</p>

<p>This panel consists of three different scenes (A, B, C; Figure 6.10). We shall discuss them individually from the viewer’s right to left (from north to south). The entire panel represents the murti Madhava, the third interior formation. The sequence of scenes north to south illustrates three aspects of the virya of the Pre-eminently Mighty formation. The source of virya is represented by Krishna sitting in front of Balarama, for they are identical to Narayana sitting in front of, and upon, Samkarshana the Snake. Virya in action is represented by Krishna wrestling Chanura, for Krishna wrestles with passion and slays with violence, but is unaffected all the while. Virya embodied for worship appears at the end as the murti Madhava standing stiffly as an icon.</p>

<h3 id="scene-a-krishna-sits-with-balarama-in-akruras-chariot"><em><strong>Scene A: Krishna Sits with Balarama in Akrura’s Chariot</strong></em></h3>
<p>THE STORY. After Akrura’s chariot leaves Gokula, it reaches the Yamuna River, where he stops. Nanda’s chariot goes on ahead, but Krishna and Balarama go to the river for their morning bath (<em>BP</em> 10.39.38–57; 10.40). They return and sit in the chariot in the shade while Akrura bathes. Akrura follows the prescribed rites, recites the “ancient prayer” (<em>brahma sanatana</em>), and immerses himself. Under water he sees Krishna and Balarama sitting as the Supreme Person and the Plower Snake. Startled, he emerges from the water, looks at the chariot, and sees Krishna and Balarama sitting there as he had left them.</p>
<p>Akrura again immerses himself in the Yamuna’s pure waters and again he sees the transcendent Bhagavan. He sees the Snake Ruler with a thousand crowned hoods, white in color with a blue garment, praised by siddhas, charanas, gandharvas, and asuras bowing their heads. He sees the four-armed Person seated on the Snake at peace, dark blue in color with a yellow garment, his reddish eyes like lotus petals. Numerous attendants praise him, including nine (or twelve) devis.5</p>
<p>Akrura responds with prayer. He first addresses the cause of everything he sees underwater as Narayana, the unmanifest Primordial Person from whose navel the lotus emerges, and from it Brahma, and from Brahma all these worlds. (The unmanifest Narayana in the waters, of course, describes the reclining icon on the other side of this wall inside the sanctum.) He then mentions five ways people worship Narayana: first, worship through unified consciousness (<em>yoga</em>); second, worship through ritual action (<em>karma</em>); and third, worship through the renunciation of ritual in favor of “knowledge as a sacrifice” (<em>jnana-yajna</em>). Fourth is the Sanskrit rites prescribed by the Bhagavan for worship of him either in one or in many material forms (<em>murti</em>). Fifth is worship of him in the shape of Shiva (<em>shiva-rupina</em>) according to the path taught by Shiva (<em>shivoktena margena</em>), but with differences according to the acharya. To explain how this is a way to worship Narayana, Akrura says that devotees of other devas may not know it, but they worship the Bhagavan because as Ruler he makes all devas. As Krishna will later teach Arjuna, just all rivers flow to the sea, all worship goes to Narayana (<em>BG</em> 9.23–25).</p>
<p>Akrura then describes the Bhagavan’s forms as modifications of matter (<em>prakriti</em>). He begins with his unmanifest subtle body as the ground plan of the gross body; the Bhagavan uses this ground plan to construct spacetime by means of Brahma and the lotus and then playfully “descends” into it as avatars (<em>BP</em> 10.40.11–22). Akrura venerates these material forms (<em>murti</em>) in the following sequence:</p>
<p>Causal Fish, and Horse-head who is the death of Madhu and Kaitabha;</p>
<p>Unbounded the Great who supports Mandara Mountain, and the form of Boar who lifts up Earth;</p>
<p>Wonderous Lion who removes fear from the world of the good, and Dwarf who extends beyond the three realms;</p>
<p>Master of Brighus who cuts down the tree of arrogant dominion, and Eminent Raghu who is the end of Ravana;</p>
<p>Satvata masters Vasudeva, Samkarshana, Pradyumna, and Aniruddha;</p>
<p>Buddha the Pure who deludes Daityas and Danavas, and Kalki’s shape who destroys those who become mlecchas.</p>
<p>The sequence thus reads: 1) Fish, 2) Hayagriva as Madhusudana, 3) Tortoise, 4) Boar, 5) Man-lion, 6) Dwarf, 7) Parashurama, 8) Raghava Rama, 9–12) the four Satvata heroes, 13) Shakyamuni Buddha, and (14) Kalki.</p>
<p>Akrura confesses his limitations and acknowledges Narayana’s grace. He is unable to control his mind propelled by desire and takes refuge at the Bhagavan’s feet, but even this act derives from Narayana’s prior grace. He ends his prayer by venerating the four formations: Vasudeva, the Plower as the dwelling place of all beings, and the Pre-eminently Mighty and the Unobstructed as the twofold Ruler of Senses. He is a refugee (<em>prapanna</em>) seeking their protection (<em>BP</em> 10.40.24–30).</p>
<p>The pool of water in this episode is pure because Krishna earlier removed its defilement, the kalmasha embodied by the naga named Kaliya. That episode, depicted at the eastern corner of the north wall, will be discussed in chapter 8. Akrura sees underwater what a sadhaka knows when he performs morning rites after Gopala has purified his consciousness (<em>chitta</em>). He knows that the Supreme Ruler (<em>parameshvara</em>) sits on the Plower Snake watching Brahma live out his days as the spacetime in which he is worshiping.6 This astounding perception is fraught with fearful implications, which is why Krishna gestures southward with the abhayamudra to reassure Akrura performing the brahma sanatana.</p>
<p>THE PANEL, SCENE A. This first scene is of Krishna and Balarama sitting in the chariot as Akrura sees them when he emerges from the pure Yamuna water (Figure 6.11). Krishna’s badly damaged face gazes directly east toward the viewer. He is dressed royally with a tall crown, has one pair of arms, and sits on a seat, his right leg drawn up and his left leg pendent. His left hand rests on his thigh. His right arm bends at the elbow and his hand forms a damaged mudra, perhaps the mushtimudra of the fist: the four fingers fold tightly into the palm and the thumb wraps over the forefinger. If so, it refers to the wrestling match ahead: Mushtika, which may mean “He of the Fist,” is the wrestler Balarama will fight; Chanura, which may mean “He Who Injures the Chest,” will fight Krishna with his fist. Krishna’s “mudra of the fist” explains why Balarama looks over Krishna’s right shoulder, as if he is talking to him about what lies ahead. Balarama, whose face is damaged, also has a tall crown and one pair of arms, and sits with legs crossed behind Krishna. Only his head tilting southward, his right shoulder, and his bent right knee are visible. He may gesture with his right hand, but damage makes it uncertain. In the panel’s present condition, nothing is depicted above these brothers.</p>

<h3 id="scene-b-krishna-as-hari-the-ruler-of-yoga-wrestles-chanura-in-mathura-as-kamsa-watches"><em><strong>Scene. B: Krishna as “Hari the Ruler of Yoga” Wrestles Chanura in Mathura as Kamsa Watches</strong></em></h3>
<p>THE STORY. By sunset Akrura’s chariot reaches Mathura, and they meet the gopas led by Nanda camped outside the city. Balarama and Krishna stay with them for the night, but Akrura continues into the city, reports their arrival to Kamsa, and returns home. The next morning the cowherds walk into the city to see its sights, and the city women praise the beauty of the brothers. Krishna seeks clothing appropriate to this Yadava capital and asks a royal washerman for the proper attire. The man arrogantly refuses and abuses him verbally, but Krishna merely nips off his head and everyone gets fine clothes. A friendly weaver adds to the brothers’ attire, and Krishna in return gives him prosperous well-being in this life, and after death emancipation with Krishna’s own shape. Sudama, a garland maker, welcomes the brothers to his home in veneration: “You two are the supreme cause of the entire moving universe, and a portion (<em>amsha</em>) of You has come to protect and assure well being. You are the friends and the atmans of the ever-moving universe, impartial in vision and the same toward all living beings, even though You enjoy the one who enjoys You” (<em>BP</em> 10.41.46–47). Sudama garlands them, and as a reward chooses unswerving devotion to the atman of all things, friendship with bhaktas, and supreme compassion for all beings. Madhava next meets Trivakra (She Who Is Bent Thrice), a hunchback servant of Kamsa with ointments for the body. She smears the brothers’ chests and arms, enhancing Balarama’s whiteness and Krishna’s blackness. In return Krishna makes her body straight, but graciously defers her offer of her courtesan services.</p>
<p>The brothers are now dressed properly and enter the Shrine of the Bow where the Sacrifice of the Bow is celebrated. But Krishna grabs the Bow, strings it, draws it, and snaps it in two with a sound so loud that it terrifies Kamsa in his palace. The brothers use the broken Bow’s pieces to slay soldiers dispatched to the scene, and then leave calmly to wander the city. At sunset they return to their camp for the night.</p>
<p>After sunrise the next morning, Kamsa has the wrestling arena consecrated and decorated, and Mathura’s people gather and take their seats. Nanda and his gopas offer their milk gifts to Kamsa, and find a platform to sit on. As Krishna and Balarama are walking to the arena, Kuvalayapida, the huge royal elephant, attacks them. Krishna, however, throws him, breaks off the elephant’s tusks, and uses one to kill him and his keeper. Holding this tusk over his shoulder, Krishna enters the arena with his brother, and the wrestlers confront them. Chanura tells Krishna that he and Balarama have been summoned by the king to wrestle. “Subjects who please royalty by mind, act, and word,” he says, “acquire majesty and wealth (<em>shri</em>); those who do not reap the opposite. It’s well known that you cowherds play at wrestling while grazing cattle in the forest. You and we should act to please the royalty, for the king is made of all beings, and therefore beings will be pleased with us” (<em>BP</em> 10.43.33, 35). Krishna’s reply is enigmatic: “Even we who wander the forest are subjects of the king of Bhojas, and we shall always act to please him, it is our highest kindness” (<em>BP</em> 10.43.37).</p>
<p>Chanura then wrestles Krishna and Mushtika wrestles Balarama. Chanura beats on Krishna’s chest with his fists, illustrating the possible meaning of his name, “He injures the chest.” But Krishna seizes his arms, whirls him around and around, and throws him to the ground dead. Mushtika slugs Balarama, likewise illustrating the possible meaning of his name, “He of the fist.” But Balarama kills him with a slap of his hand. Three other wrestlers die and the others flee. The brothers now summon their fellow gopas to come and dance on the arena floor, Kamsa’s musicians and their own anklets providing the music. This spectacle pleases everyone except Kamsa, and he orders the next stage of his long-range plan, the slaughter of Nanda, of Vasudeva, and of Ugrasena (<em>BP</em> 10.44.17–28; 30–33).</p>
<p>THE PANEL, SCENE B. This second scene portrays Krishna as Hari the Ruler of Yoga (Yogeshvara Hari), about to throw Chanura (Figure 6.12).7 The two wrestlers of equal height stand in a locked grip, each with one pair of arms. Krishna on the south has tied up his loincloth and has removed his crown, revealing long hair in a bun on the top of his head. Chanura on the north wears a wrestler’s garb: a loincloth, a double belt around his abdomen, and a turban tying his long hair. Krishna has the advantage as he stretches his right arm across Chanura to grasp the left side of his belt; his left arm either disappears behind his opponent or has been erased by damage. Krishna’s right leg stretched diagonally to the south supports him as he steps with his left leg in front of Chanura’s right leg to pull him off balance. Krishna glances downward with a smile, but Chanura, whose left foot vainly seeks support near the chariot bottom of the previous scene, looks straight ahead with grim knowledge of impending death.</p>
<p>Directly above, separated by a ledge, is a platform on which two crowned men and one woman sit with legs drawn up as they watch the scene below (Figure 6.13). Kamsa, to the north on the viewer’s right, looks down; he rests his right hand on his right thigh, and stretches his left arm upward; his open hand may signal the beginning of the wrestling, or alarm at Chanura’s impending death. The man sitting to his right also rests his right hand on his right thigh, but his left arm is not visible. The woman to his right grips an object upright in her right hand, but her left arm is also not visible. These two figures are not identified, but they do not appear agitated, perhaps because the wrestling has just begun.</p>

<p>FIGURE 6.13. Panel 12 B–2: Kamsa, seated above the wrestlers, is alarmed. Photo by Sathya Seelan.</p>
<p>THE PANEL’S MEANINGS. This wrestling scene alludes to the “death” of “the Pallava Wrestler” as an Indra of Men. Through a play on the word <em>malla</em>, which means “wrestler,” Krishna wrestling Chanura is used to represent Krishna’s conquest of Nandivarman, “The Pallava Wrestler,” which is the meaning of his personal name Pallavamalla. A Sanskrit poem written during Pallavamalla’s reign celebrates him as “a born emperor, who is handsome, who is a master both in the art of gymnastics and in the virtue of modesty” (<em>SII</em> 2: 357–357, stanza 30). He may have been a “born emperor,” but his imperial identity emerged only after Krishna slew a misperception about kingship he received when he was consecrated to rule Kanchipuram around 731. Chanura is not merely a wrestler but also King Kamsa’s companion, and before they wrestle he voiced this misperception when he challenged Krishna: “Subjects who please royalty by mind, act, and word acquire majesty and wealth (<em>shri</em>); those who do not reap the opposite … the king is made of all beings.” Chanura was not wrong about the way the king is made, of course, because the ceremony for engendering a king (<em>rajasuya</em>) does construct him from “all beings.” A realm is like a wheel (<em>chakra</em>): a wheel moves because of its pivot, a realm flourishes because of its king. But when Kamsa is the king this idea of kingship turns into despotism. In contrast, the Bhagavata understanding of kingship subordinates the king’s pleasure to God’s pleasure. Subjects are first of all to please God by thought, word, and deed, not the king; and a Bhagavata king is likewise to derive pleasure from God’s pleasure. The northern path for Pallavamala culminates in Krishna eliminating Chanura’s notion of kingship from his rule as Nandivarman. Ruling exclusively for the sake of Vasudeva Krishna, his rule is a virya rule.</p>
<h3 id="scene-c-krishna-stands-as-victorious-madhava">****<em><strong>Scene C: Krishna Stands as Victorious Madhava</strong></em></h3>
<p>THE PANEL, SCENE C. In this final scene Krishna appears formally clothed, crowned, and standing stiffly with one pair of arms (Figure 6.14). He rests his right hand on his hip, and raises his left hand at his side to form a mudra difficult to read, but appears to point toward the depiction of Krishna wrestling to his left.</p>
<p>FIGURE 6.14. Panel 12 C: Krishna stands as victorious Madhava. Photo by Hudson, 1993.</p>
<p>THE PANEL’S MEANINGS. This depiction is of the victorious Madhava, the embodiment of the virya of the Pre-eminently Mighty formation. Krishna embodies virya, which besides manliness, heroism, and sexual potency denotes the Pre-eminently Mighty’s ability to act without being affected by his action; he “owns” the passion (<em>rajas</em>) he emanates. Krishna as Madhava will leap up to Kamsa’s gallery, grab his hair, and pull him down to his death.8</p>
<p><em>Madhu</em> denotes a sweet substance, a sweet intoxicating drink, spring, the first month of the year, Chaitra, and the Vrishni lineage; <em>madhava</em> denotes the second month, Vaishakha, and the Yadavas. Chaitra and Vaishakha constitute spring (<em>vasanta</em>), but due to the precession of the equinoxes they fell about three weeks closer to the vernal equinox in the eighth century than they do now. Vasanta and the dual madhu-madhava help prepare the unction of Goddess Rama in <em>BP</em> 8.8.11.</p>
<p>Significantly, Madhava’s body is long: His feet are at a lower level than those of the wrestlers, and his crown rises above their piled hair. On one hand, this illustrates the Tamil epithet of the Bhagavan as Netiyon, “the long one,” or as Netumal, “the tall Vishnu.” On the other hand, it reveals a three-dimensional perspective to the panel. Of the three scenes, the feet of Krishna and Balarama in Akrura’s chariot are the highest above the panel’s bottom, for they are farthest from the viewer. The feet of Krishna and Chanura are lower, for they are nearer the viewer. And the feet of Madhava are the lowest, for he stands nearest the viewer. Madhava Krishna thus ends the northern path as an icon to be worshiped.</p>
