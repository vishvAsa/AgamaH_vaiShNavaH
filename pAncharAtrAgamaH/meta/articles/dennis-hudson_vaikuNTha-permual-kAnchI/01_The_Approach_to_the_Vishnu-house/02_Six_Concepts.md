title = "02 Six Concepts"

+++





In order to discuss the religious ideas that produced the emperor and his Vishnu-house, it will be helpful to examine six concepts basic to Bhagavata Dharma, as I understand it, by the eighth century. They are God as person, God as place, God as male and female, the doctrine of formation, the structure of the person, and inner vision.



## **God as Person**

Who is God? Who becomes Krishna? According to Bhagavatas, God \(*deva*\) has at least one thousand names. In this study six will be especially important: Narayana, Vasudeva, Bhagavan, Vishnu, Hari, and Krishna.



### ***Narayana***

The name Narayana denotes God as Supreme Self \(*paramatman*\), who is Supreme Person \(*parama purusha*\).1 Narayana is unchanging and unique, and transcends space and time by containing it within His Self. Brahma, who emerges from Narayana yet remains inseparable from Him, glosses His name as the “resting place or course \(*ayana*\) of man \(*narah*\), the wisdom ruling the atman of all embodied beings, the witness of all realms, who has waters as the resting place of His body, which eats men but does not compress them because of its true being, not because of His magically creative power” \(*BP* 10.14.14\).2 Markandeya’s vision of the baby on the banyan branch in the waters of the deluge illustrates Brahma’s final statement, for when the baby swallows this seer he sees the entire universe inside him and functioning properly \(*BP* 12.9\).

Seers have seen Narayana as a mass of light \(*vishakhayupa*\) shooting forth all forms like sparks, a light of pure consciousness and being that gives rise to “formations” \(*vyuha*\) and to their “transformations” \(*vibhava*\). Among the latter, for example, are the shining devas of light, their asura opponents of darkness, humans, animals, and nonsentient elements.3 Yet everything produced by this light, including darkness and asuras, is contained within it and sustained by it. The vimana that constitutes the Emperor’s Vishnu-house appears to be a built form of this blazing pillar.4 When it was newly painted it must have looked from a distance like a mountainous flame emerging above the enclosing prakara wall, replicating on a gigantic scale the fire burning in the square raised altar \(*uttara vedi*\) at the eastern end of the Vedic sacrificial arena.



### ***Vasudeva***

When Narayana manifests His glorious wealth \(*bhaga*\) prior to producing spacetime and its contents, he is known as Vasudeva, a name whose meaning repeats the meaning of Narayana as the abode of humans. He is simultaneously “God \(*deva*\) who is the dwelling place \(*vasu*\) for everything,” and “God \(*deva*\) for whom everything is a dwelling place \(*vasu*\).” The name Vasudeva captures the mystery Chatakopan experienced, which we shall encounter repeatedly: God contains everything, yet at the same time is contained by everything. Vasudeva names the unmanifest *brahman* \(*akshara brahma*\) as the cause of all causes; He is the primordial essence of being \(*sat*\), consciousness \(*chit*\), and joy \(*ananda*\) with a “body” made of pure clarity \(*shuddhasattva*\) \(Tapasyananda 1980–1982 1: xxx–xxxii\). The vision of God’s body is everything a Bhagavata can hope for. “Who sees me everywhere and sees everything in me,” Krishna tells Arjuna, “for him I am not destroyed and he is not destroyed for me…. \[But\] the person possessing *jnana*, who at the end of many births takes refuge in me \[saying\] ‘everything is Vasudeva,’ he is a great atman very difficult to find” \(*BG* 6.30; 7.19\).

Why does Narayana as Vasudeva bring all things into being? Bhagavatas say it is for His own pleasure \(*svasukha*\); spacetime arises from the joy innate to the creativity of consciousness \(*BP* 1.9.32\). In relation to every “thing,” which is a name-and-form \(*namarupa*\), Vasudeva’s bhaga divides into three pairs. They are:

1.knowledge or omniscience \(*jnana*\) and its indefatigable or transforming power \(*bala*\);

2.sovereignty \(*aishvarya*\) and its ability to act without being affected by the action \(*virya*\); and

3.the potency \(*shakti*\) of sound and its brilliant conquering power \(*tejas*\).

As Sanjukta Gupta explains, omniscience \(*jnana*\) is God’s essence and is primary; the other five bhagas are contained within it \(Gupta 1989: 225\).

God is called the Bhagavan because He possesses this wealth \(*bhaga*\) divided into three pairs. A person, whether male or female, who has been consecrated to the Bhagavan is called a Bhagavata, and anyone exclusively devoted to him is in practice a strict monotheist \(*ekantikabhakta*\). \(Appendix 1 contains an exploration of the term *Bhagavata*.\) A Bhagavata belongs to the Bhagavan in the way a slave belongs to a master. This metaphor of master and slave, which plays a highly significant role in religious thought and behavior, means that not only does the master own the slave but he is also responsible for him, protects him, and may use him as his representative. The slave’s place is at his master’s feet, and he is to be ready to serve him at any moment without question. He feels safe if his master is both powerful and compassionate, which God certainly is. There is an intimacy of mutual dependence in this metaphor not found in the Euro-American concept of slave as property.



### ***Vishnu***

Bhagavatas believe that because the Supreme Person as Supreme Self pervades all the things he emanates and is the one who acts within and through them, he is to be called Vishnu. This name points to him as the “pervading actor” and is found in the mantras of the *Rig Veda*. The seer Dirghatamas addresses Vishnu in three *Rig Veda* poems \(1.155–157\). He extols his prowess \(*virya*\) as like the lion, the fearful and hungry wild beast \(*mriga*\) of the mountains, whose roar at the end of night signals the approach of sunrise. He praises the three strides \(*vikrama*\) Vishnu takes to measure out directional space, only two of which, earth and sky, can humans see. His third stride places His foot \(*padam*\) in the realm \(*padam*\) above the pole star \(*dhruva*\) from which He looks down on devas in heaven and humans on earth. Vishnu resides in His padam as a young prince \(*yuvakumara*\), who turns chronological time like a vast wheel \(*chakra*\) making ninety-four revolutions.5 Yet Vishnu also acts in the worlds beneath Him through His descents \(*avatara*\) in confined modes \(*nirodha*\) to protect and to reveal.



### ***Hari***

While the name Vishnu denotes God’s fullness \(*vishvam*\) as pervading everything \(*vishnu*\) he possesses, the name Hari denotes his color \(Bhattar: 106–108\). The color called *hari* in the *Rig Veda* ranges from fawn through reddish brown, brown, tawny, pale yellow, yellow and bay, to green and greenish. It suggests the color of the lion in the mountains likened to Vishnu, the color of gold as an emblem of prosperity, and the color green as the nourishment of cattle. *Hari* also suggests the Bhagavan’s ability to take away evil or sin; in this sense it also takes the form *hara*, destroyer, which is a name for Shiva \(Monier-Williams 1964:1289\). In Bhagavata lore, Hari as green and greenish refers to the Bhagavan’s all-pervading fullness as it resides on \(or as\) the hill named Govardhana in Vrinda’s Forest \(Vrindavana\) along the Yamuna River in Vraja \(*BP* 10.24.31–38\). His color there is *hari* and he accepts the gifts cowherds offer him for the sake of prosperous increase \(*vardhana*\) for their cattle \(*go*\) and fields \(Bhattar: 106, 585\).



### ***Krishna***

The *Bhagavata Purana* explicitly identifies Krishna as Narayana, Vasudeva, Vishnu, and Hari—the Bhagavan fully present in human form. The bard named Ugrashravas tells Saunaka and other seers at a sacrifice that all other appearances of God are his shares and parts \(*amshakala*\), but “the man Krishna is the Bhagavan himself” \(*BP* 1.3.28\). This statement appears in a portion of the purana that is probably late in origin, perhaps a clarification by Bhagavatas of their belief about Krishna addressed to others who know his story but are not members of their religion. But this is not a new doctrine, because the Krishna Story \(*Krishnakatha*\) in the *Bhagavata Purana* makes the same point repeatedly, and this story belongs to what I think is the oldest portion of the purana.

The Krishna Story comprises Books Ten and Eleven. There is no question in my mind that later portions have been inserted into it, for example, Akrura’s prayer while submerged in a clear pool of Yamuna River water \(*BP* 10.40\), the story of Rishabha’s shramana sons discussed in chapter 1 \(*BP* 11.2–5\), and the long “Summary of the *Brahman* Doctrine” Krishna teaches to Uddhava in Dvaraka just before he goes to Prabhasa \(*BP* 11.6–29\).6 If we remove these later additions, the Krishna Story consists of Book Ten and three chapters of Book Eleven \(11.1, 30, 31\); and this is where we find early identifications of Krishna as the Bhagavan Himself \(*bhagavan svayam*\). Let us examine some examples.

At the beginning of the Krishna Story, the Bhagavan as the Self of everything tells the creative power of His unified consciousness \(*yogamaya*\) about His plan for His own birth as Balarama and Krishna. He begins with Balarama. “The whole of Shesha, which is my abode, will become an embryo in Devaki’s womb which you shall transplant to Rohini’s womb” \(*BP* 10.2.8\). His abode \(*dhama*\), of course, is omniscience \(*jnana*\), which is the bhaga at the base of all others. Jnana is the first to emanate to produce directional space and chronological time, and when the other five have devolved into it, only it remains. The word *shesha* as “first to escape” and “primordial remainder” \(*adishesha*\) captures both meanings. In iconography, the remainder \(*shesha*\) as God’s abode \(*dhama*\) appears as a multihooded snake \(*naga*\) that has no end \(*ananta*\), because jnana encompasses spacetime and is infinite. Devaki conceives him in Mathura, but Rohini in Gokula gives birth to him as Balarama.

The Bhagavan then tells Yogamaya about his birth as Krishna: “I will then become Devaki’s son through a share of my glorious wealth \(*amshabhagena*\), and you, O fair one, will become \[the daughter\] of Nanda’s wife Yashoda” \(*BP* 10.2.9\). This statement makes an important theological point. A “share” of the bhaga of the Supreme Person or Self is the Supreme Person’s bhaga, because a “share” \(*amsha*\) of fullness \(*purnam*\) taken from fullness is fullness. The *Brihadaranyaka Upanishad* \(5.1\) explains the doctrine this way, in Patrick Oliville’s translation:


The world there is full;

The world here is full;

Fullness from fullness proceeds.

After taking fully from the full,

It still remains completely full.7


This doctrine is taught through narrative details. Krishna as God’s fullness will contain the moving universe within his self, which means Devaki his mother becomes the dwelling place for Him who is the dwelling place for the moving universe \(*BP* 10.2.19\)—the mystery of the container contained by what it contains once again. His cowherd mother Yashoda perceives this when Krishna, nursing at her breast, yawns and she sees the entire realm of the moving and unmoving inside his mouth \(*BP* 10.7.34–37\). In another episode Krishna eats mud, but denies it, so Yashoda forces him to open his mouth and again sees the entire universe inside it \(*BP* 10.8.32–45\). The seer Markandeya has a similar vision \(*BP* 12.9.10–34\). And Brahma, too, is astounded that Narayana contains him even as he contains Krishna opening his mouth for Yashoda \(*BP* 10.14.11–17\).

Kamsa will hate Krishna as the Ruler of Senses \(Hrishikesha\), but Brahma, Shiva, Narada, and others will praise him as the Person \(*purusha*\) Madhava, who earlier made descents \(*krita-avatara*\) not out of causal necessity \(*karana*\) but out of play \(*vinoda*\) \(*BP* 10.2.24–42\). He was contained \(*nirodha*\) as Fish \(*matsya*\), Horse \(*ashva*\), Tortoise \(*kacchapa*\), Man-lion \(*nrisimha*\), Boar \(*varaha*\), Goose \(*hamsa*\), King \(*rajanya*\), Seer \(*vipra*\), and the Learned One \(*vibudha*\) \(*BP* 10.2.39–40\). But none of these was God in His fullness.

In the dark of the night “the Pervading Actor, the dwelling place of all hearts” takes birth as the Impeller of Men \(*janardana*\) in Kamsa’s jail through the Kshatriya named Vasudeva and the divine shape of his wife Devaki \(*BP* 10.3.8\). For this reason Krishna the man is known as “son of Vasudeva” and as “son of Devaki” \(*devakiputra*\). But to save his son’s life, Vasudeva quickly takes him to the cowherd settlement \(*gokula*\) in Vraja to live in disguise as a Shudra keeper of cattle; these people have no walled city, no territory, no village, and no house, but reside in forests and on mountains \(*BP* 10.24.24\). Later, when his “birth” as the son of the cowherd chieftain Nanda to his wife Yashoda is celebrated, Krishna is said to be the “endless ruler of everything” \(*vishveshvara-ananta*\) who is both Pervading Actor and Nanda’s son \(*BP* 10.5.13–16\). Nanda’s wandering people now prosper, because by dwelling among them Hari, the unborn protector of man \(*abhun-nripa*\), turns their gokula into a playground for Shri, his Dear One \(*rama-krida*\) \(*BP* 10.5.18\). When these cowherds prepare the annual sacrifice to Indra as the source of this prosperity, Krishna appears to them as Hari on the mountain Govardhana in a gigantic shape \(*rupa*\) that consumes their offerings \(*BP* 10.24.35–38\), and then holds up the mountain as an umbrella to shield the cowherds from Indra’s angry rains.

Krishna’s true identity is also stated in the *Chandogya Upanishad* \(*CU* 3.17\). Here he appears as a student of “the awesome son of Angiras” \(*ghora angirasa*\); Krishna is identified by his matrynomic, Krishna Son of Devaki. This “awesome son of Angiras” has just taught Krishna the doctrine that a man’s life is a sacrifice, a doctrine at the heart of the *Bhagavad-gita*. The sage is now without craving or thirst \(*apipasa*\) and near his end. In this state of clear perception he tells Devaki’s son, “Take refuge in these three: You are the undecaying \(*akshita*\), you are the unfallen \(*acyuta*\), you are life breath sharpened \(*pranasanshita*\).” The final identification appears to denote the syllable *Om*. This upanishad begins by identifying *Om* as the High Chant \(*udritha*\), which is not only the essence of the *Sama Veda* but also “the quintessence of all essences; it is the highest, the ultimate, the eighth” \(*CU* 1.3\). And Krishna in the *Bhagavad-gita* similarly identifies himself as the imperishable atman dwelling in the hearts of all beings, as the *Sama Veda*, and as the syllable *Om* \(*BG* 10.20, 22, 25\).

It is possible that this “awesome son of Angiras” appears as Krishna’s guru in the Krishna Story, but the evidence is only suggestive. In this story Devaki’s husband Vasudeva has Purodhasa and other Brahmins consecrate Krishna and Balarama as “twice-born” \(*dvija-samskriti, BP* 10.45.26\). Purodhasa may be the same as the “awesome son of Angiras” in the *Chandogya Upanishad*, because the form *puradhasa* denotes an Angirasa \(Monier-Williams 1964: 636a\). If so, Krishna Devakiputra in that upanishad and Krishna Devakiputra in this Krishna Story are the same, and so is his guru. This implies that the *Chandogya Upanishad*, which may date to the eighth century BCE, provides a detail of the Krishna Story known at the time: near the end of his life, the “awesome son of Angiras” revealed to Krishna that he is the imperishable, unfallen, and life-breath sharpened, and therefore is greater than Indra, a point the Krishna Story makes repeatedly. This detail also suggests that Krishna belongs to the *Atharva-angirasa* tradition, which raises the further question of whether Krishna Devakiputra is the same Krishna son of Angirasa who composed three poems addressed to Indra in the *Rig Veda* \(*RV* 10.42–44\). Finally, it is significant that the *Shatapatha Brahmana* dated to the same period as the *Chandogya Upanishad* contains an early account of the Person Narayana in the context of a pancharatra or five-night sacrifice, for the liturgical tradition \(*agama*\) of the five-nights \(*pancharatra*\) is closely connected to the Krishna Story and to Bhagavata Dharma \(see Hudson 2002a and 2002c\).

According to the Krishna Story, after Purodhasa consecrates the brothers as twice born, the acharya of the Yadava clan named Garga consecrates them to the Gayatri vow \(*gayatri-vrata, BP* 10.45.29\). Afterward they dwell with Sandipani, a native of Kashi living in Avanti, where they learn sixty-four subjects in sixty-four days \(*BP* 10.45.36\). When Krishna and Balarama are one hundred twenty-five years old they leave Earth as men, and shortly thereafter our human realm of Bharata enters the present Kali Yuga, the age dominated by delusion: Earth loses her true being \(*satya*\), right order \(*dharma*\), satisfaction \(*dhriti*\), glory \(*kirti*\), and majesty \(*shri*\) \(*BP* 11.31.17\). Yet Krishna’s presence—like that of less complete avataras, who are only shares or parts of the whole—continues on earth in the mode of icons \(*archa*\). They are sculpted and consecrated according to rites that “have come down” \(*agama*\) from Vasudeva as teachings addressed specifically to the Kali Yuga. People in this age who serve Krishna in his iconic bodies according to the mixed rites of Veda and Agama as found in Pancharatra liturgies may gain the true being, right order, and satisfaction of the previous age. And if they are Bhagavata, like Nandivarman Pallavamalla, they may also gain glory and kingship.



## **God as Place**

The transcendent Vasudeva is person, certainly, but He is also “place” or “presence” in an extended spatial sense. The Supremely Transcendent Person \(*parama mahapurusha*\) is also thought of as the “Pervading Actor’s Supreme Home” \(*vishnor dhama parama*\), as the “place” that Krishna tells Arjuna is his Highest Home \(*BP* 3.11.42; BG 8.21; 10.12–13; 15.6\). God as Highest Home or extended presence is called Vaikuntha Dhama, which means the “home without ignorance” or “the presence penetrating everywhere” or “the invincible realm.”8 The visual depiction of God at Home portrays Vasudeva sitting or reclining on the Snake, whose spreading hoods shelter Him like an open umbrella, because this endless and brilliant light is His Supreme Home constituted of white jnana.



## **God as Father and Mother**

This brings us to the Bhagavata belief that the Supreme Person is father and mother together.9 Within Vasudeva’s unity, “he” implies “she” and “she” implies “he.” God’s feminine dimension is the Goddess \(*devi*\). She, too, has many names, the most characteristic being Shri and Lakshmi, for she is majesty \(*shri*\) whose mark is wealth \(*lakshmi*\). But she is also Bhumidevi, because she is the material realm \(*bhumi*\); and she is Mahamaya, because she is transcendent and magical creativity \(*maya*\).

Vasudeva is pure consciousness and Devi is Vasudeva’s personality or “I-ness.” She is the thought within his omniscience. She exists because of him and depends on him, just as our thought depends upon our consciousness. Conversely, he depends on her, because he achieves everything—all that he thinks—only through her as his thoughts manifested. Devi is Vasudeva’s power to intend an act \(*kriyashakti*\); and at the same time, she is the power to bring this act into being \(*bhutishakti*\). As conscious intent she resembles fire \(*agni*\), and as fruitful act she resembles liquid \(*soma*\), for in esoteric analysis, fire produces liquid, and liquid produces everything of earth.10

Whenever we speak of “him” acting, therefore, we must always understand that the actor in fact is “she.” He empowers her because of his presence as omniscient consciousness in the same way as a magnet empowers iron filings by its presence, or a king empowers his ministers and generals through his authority. Subjects commonly say the king won a battle, when in fact he remained in the palace and his general on the field led the fighting. The ruler won because the general possessed his authority to put his will into effect in his name. Vasudeva similarly empowers Devi to act in his name.

In common with the Shaiva Agama, the Pancharatra Agama teaches that in relation to the universe, Vasudeva performs five acts by means of Devi. First, in a “place” within his omniscient and unified knowledge, he conceals himself. Within this concealed “place” he forms directional space and chronological time into spacetime and all its contents. He sustains what he has formed. He also reveals himself to some beings within spacetime. Finally, he devolves it all and the “place” disappears. Again, only he and she exist.

Repeated metaphors articulate this doctrine. One is agricultural. The farmer \(male\) knows his field \(female\), knows where to plow it, and knows when to plant his seed. Once planted, the farmer watches and guards the field as she transforms his seed into plants that produce food \(*anna*\). The obvious sexual dimension of this metaphor is also important. The king in the royal bed plants his seed in the queen’s womb in order to produce a son as heir. He watches and protects her as she gestates his seed into a human being. Insofar as his seed is an embryonic form of himself \(*garbha*\), the king is “reborn” through her as the prince. In this way the queen becomes the king’s “mother.”

This ancient and salient idea is basic to the rites of engendering a king \(*rajasuya*\). Shakuntala articulates it to King Dushyanta in the ancient story of the birth of their son Bharata. As J. A. B. van Buitenen translates her speech to Dushyanta: “A husband enters his wife and is reborn from her—thus the old poets know this as a wife’s wifehood…. A son, the wise say, is the man himself born from himself; therefore a man will look upon the mother of his son as his own mother. The son born from his wife is as a man’s face in a mirror; and looking at him brings as much joy to a father as finding heaven brings to a saint” \(van Buitenen 1959: 167\). The queen fulfills her role as wife by giving birth to her husband as her son. But in order to obtain his embryo she must use passion skillfully, because she must enable him to lose his self-discipline, become sexually aroused, and release his seed into her. A useful aid in ancient royal courts is liquor \(*sura*\).

These metaphors are used to illustrate a process beyond human knowing. By means of Devi, Vasudeva voluntarily becomes “inebriated” and obscures his unified jnana so that he “sees double.” Devi now makes herself available to him and receives his embryonic “seed” into her body, where she gestates it into their son the prince, whom they name Brahma. The seer named Kapila, who is believed to embody the mode of consciousness called “extinction” \(*nirvana*\) to teach samkhya ideas and bhaktiyoga \(*BP* 3.25.28–31\), summarizes this activity within God this way:

The beginningless Self \(*atman*\) is Person \(*purusha*\) without qualities \(*guna*\) and transcendent to matter \(*prakriti*\). His own light illuminates Him from within and is full of everything. Out of play \(*lila*\), He who is omnipresent \(*vibhuh*\) resorts to subtle matter that is divine and made of qualities \(*guna*\)—subtle matter approaches Him, as it were, and makes Herself available to Him. Their progeny, formed from her marvelous qualities, look at emerging matter, are bewildered by it, and knowledge of Him in this world instantly hides from them. \(*BP* 3.26.3–5\)

Brahma is the first of their progeny, the crown prince, so to speak. But just as Kapila says, he is born without knowing his parents despite his name. *Brahma* \(with a long *a* at the end\) is the masculine form of *brahman*, which means “growth,” “expansion,” or “evolution,” and denotes primordial being abstractly. In Bhagavata theology this abstract *brahman* is actually the Ancient Couple: param brahma, or *brahman* as supreme, is Father, and maha brahma, or *brahman* as great, is Mother \(*BG* 10.12; 13.12; 14.3–4\). Brahma the prince is named after both parents. He is Vasudeva the father reborn through Devi the mother, but as an ignorant son. Brahma is God’s ego; he is consciousness deluded by the sense of “This I am” \(*ahamkarana*\) and propelled by passion \(*rajas*\). To live his life as God’s deluded ego, Brahma transforms his own body into the universe of directional space and lunar-solar time, which is therefore known as Brahma’s sphere \(*brahmanda*\). We may call it spacetime, because directional space and chronological time form a single body for him. Brahma leads his life of days and nights under his father’s imperial authority and his mother’s unblinking gaze. The end of his night \(*ratra*\) when he arises for another of his days is known as Brahma’s hour \(*brahmamuhurta*\). This is the hour \(*hora*\) Brahma awakens to allow all things potential to become actual; seeds planted by intentional action \(*karma*\) in his previous day now ripen into the fruit \(*phala*\) of his new day. A similar hour ends the night among devas and asuras, among the ancestral manes \(*pitri*\), and among humans. In each case this hour embodies the potential from which all possibilities of the day develop.

In early Tamil poetry, Vasudeva with Devi is known as Tirumal. Krishna and Vishnu are both known as Mal, which means, as Kamil Zvelebil observes, “The Dark One” or “The Great One” \(Zvelebil 1977: 238–241\). *Mal* denotes God’s significant features: as “The Great One” \(*mal*\), he is the Bhagavan Vasudeva, and as “The Dark One” \(*mal*\), he is Krishna. The Sanskrit word *shri* in Tamil is *tiru*, and *tiru* it is prefixed to *mal* to form the name Tirumal. Zvelebil suggests it denotes “The Holy \(or Blessed\) Dark One.” But in Bhagavata terms it denotes the Bhagavan as the Ancient Couple, “Majestic Devi with the Great and Dark Vasudeva.”

Tirumal may also be glossed as the Shri Bhagavan, “Majesty with the Possessor of Wealth \(*Bhaga*\).” This name appears in the title of the most authoritative collection of ancient lore \(*purana*\) of the Bhagavata Dharma, the *Shrimad Bhagavata Purana*. Its name literally means “ancient lore \(*purana*\) pertaining to the slave of the Bhagavan \(*bhagavata*\) who possesses majesty \(*shri*\).” In this case the slave is the consecrated king together with his queen, a royal couple representing Tirumal to its realm in the way an enslaved couple may represent its master if he so chooses.



## **The Doctrine of Formation \(*Vyuha*\)**

The process by which Narayana Vasudeva turns His self into spacetime is explained by the Pancharatra doctrine of vyuha. The word *vyuha*, often translated as “emanation,” also means “re-arrangement” or “formation.” *Vyuha*, for example, is used in the *Mahabharata* for the formations that the armies of the Pandavas and Kauravas make on each day of battle to achieve strategic goals. When an army makes a specific formation \(*vyuha*\), it remains a single army, but is rearranged for a particular purpose. Similarly, when God makes a formation \(*vyuha*\), He remains single, but is arranged for a particular purpose. The difference, of course, is that whereas an army rearranges its component warriors to effect a specific formation, God rearranges the contents of consciousness through yogamaya. Each time, however, God is fully present in each formation even though its particular “shape” conceals the other formations He makes.

Vasudeva as supreme \(*para*\) and Vasudeva as formation \(*vyuha*\) differ only in relation to the beings produced. The supreme Vasudeva cannot be seen from within spacetime any more than a fetus can see the mother carrying it. But Vasudeva as formation can be seen if, to continue the metaphor, the fetus is born an infant. This birth occurs for Bhagavatas through the rites of consecration \(*diksha*\). But perception of Vasudeva as formation comes only from the disciplined way of life \(*sadhana*\) the consecrated devotee \(*sadhaka*\) must follow, and even then few attain it. Only the exceptional sadhaka like Chatakopan clearly sees God in this lifetime.

Vasudeva as formation produces his body, its contents, and its actions through three specific rearrangements of himself in a specific sequence. The primary Vasudeva formation first changes into the formation called the Plower \(Samkarshana\). He then changes this formation into the formation called the Pre-eminently Mighty \(Pradyumna\). He changes this formation into the formation called the Unobstructed \(Aniruddha\). By means of these three formations He also produces twelve material forms \(*murti*\) interior to them \(*vyuha-antara*\). We shall discuss the formations and their interior formations when we turn to the vimana in chapter 5.



## **The Structure of the Person**

Bhagavata Dharma accepts a concept of the human person \(*purusha*\) shared widely by religions that base themselves on Veda. It lies at the heart of this temple and of its liturgies and deserves careful attention. The portion of the *Taittiriya Upanishad* called Brahmavalli \(*TU* 2\) teaches it. The Brahmavalli analyzes a man who sits cross-legged in a stable posture of yoga, faces north, and performs rites of the Atharva-angirasas.11 He is the *brahman* priest of shrauta sacrifices responsible for the correct performance by all other priests and therefore knows all four Veda collections \(*samhita*\). He sits south of the high altar \(*uttara vedi*\), faces north, and employs mantras from the *Atharvaangirasa* collection.

The scripture begins by using a mandala to describe this *brahman* priest as he is visible to any viewer \(Figure 2.1\). It then describes him in terms of five layers of matter, four of which are dimensions of the man invisible to us because they constitute his soul \(*jiva*\). The mandala is a map that begins as a point. The point extends in the cardinal directions as two equally long axes. One axis runs west to east, the other runs north to south. The axes intersect at the center. Above the center is the point from which they emerge. The mandala thus depicts five directions normally described clockwise: east, south, west, north, and the center, which may also denote the apex.

The scripture uses the mandala’s two axes to describe the yogin’s visible body as he sits facing north. Its north-south axis forms his vertical alignment. The southern end of the axis is his head, the center of the axis is his torso pillar, and the northern end of the axis is his supporting posterior.12 The west-east axis forms his horizontal alignment from shoulder to shoulder. The western end of the axis is his left side, the center is his torso pillar, and the eastern end is his right side.



### ***Five Material Sheaths as Persons***

The five layers of matter \(*prakriti*\) that constitute the human person are called sheaths \(*kosha*\) \(Figure 2.2\). Because matter is constantly in motion, these sheaths are ever-moving material patterns that remain distinct even as they mingle with each other. The Brahmavalli says that each sheath is a person \(*purusha; TU* 2.1–6\), which of course means that this man sitting in yoga performance is fivefold. Each of his material persons has the same shape, each envelops the person composed of matter less dense than its matter, and each permeates the person enveloping it. The sequence of these sheathlike persons moves from the visible body made of flesh and bone inwardly through more refined invisible bodies to end with the most refined body of all. This final sheathlike person envelops the nonmaterial atman, the yogin’s Self.

SHEATH 1. The first person is the one visible to another person or to himself in a mirror. He is made of the taste or essence of food \(*annarasamaya*\), hair grows on his head, and his vertical and horizontal alignments follow the mandala described above.

SHEATH 2. The second person, within the flesh-and-bone person, permeates it as the person made of life-breath \(*pranamaya*\). His head is life-breath itself \(*pranaeva*\). His right side is breath inhaled through the mouth to permeate his whole body \(*vyana*\). His left side is breath expelled down and out through his anus \(*apana*\). His torso is space \(*akasha*\). And his supporting posterior is earth \(*prithvi*\).

SHEATH 3. Within the life-breath person and permeating him is the third person made of mind or mental activity \(*manasmaya*\). Most people’s mental activity consists of widely varied subjects, but since this yogin is the *brahman* priest of shrauta rites, Veda’s four compilations construct him. The *Yajus* formulas are his head, the *Rig* poems are his right side, the *Sama* chants are his left side, the rules of substitution \(*adesha*\) are his torso, and the *Atharvaangirasas* are his supporting posterior.

SHEATH 4. Within the mind person and permeating him is the person made of discriminative or subject-object knowledge \(*vijnanamaya*\). His head is faith \(*shraddha*\), his right side is true order \(*rita*\), his left side is true being \(*satya*\), his torso is consciousness unified \(*yoga*\), and his supporting posterior is performance \(*mahas*\).

SHEATH 5. The fifth person is made of joy \(*anandamaya*\) and permeates the person of discriminative knowledge. His head is pleasure \(*priya*\), his right side is delight \(*moda*\), his left side is thrill \(*pramoda*\), his torso is joy \(*ananda*\), and his supporting posterior is *brahman. Brahman* as his atman of pure consciousness \(*chit*\) is at the bottom of the spine.13

When we combine this yogin’s vertical and horizontal alignments with his five material persons and transfer them to a single plane, the mandala mapping of this particular human person emerges in a complex manner \(Figure 2.3\). These ideas about what constitutes a person will be useful for later reference. More immediately important is the way these five person-sheaths are arranged in three sets of material bodies \(*sharira*\).

### ***The Five Person-Sheaths as Three Sets of Bodies***

SET ONE. The first set is the single person of the gross material body perceived by others and seen by oneself in a mirror. It is the body of matter in its most dense or gross form \(*sthula-sharira*\). It begins as an embryo and ends as a corpse burning on the cremation pyre.

SET TWO. The second set includes the remaining four persons. It constitutes the soul, which is called the “living” \(*jiva*\).14 The soul is composed of matter, but it is invisible to perception through the organs of the gross body. It is a body of subtle or invisible matter \(*sukshma-sharira*\).

SET THREE. The third set is a single person within the subtle-body soul. It is the person comprised of joy enveloping the atman directly. This finest mode of matter is called the body of causation or causal subtle body \(*karana-sukshmasharira*\). It is causal because it carries the “seeds” the person has planted through intentional action \(*karman*\). When the soul leaves the gross body at death, the person of life-breath \(*prana*\) merges with the wind \(*vayu*\). The person of mental activity devolves into the person of subject-object consciousness, who then devolves into the person of joy. This threefold mode of the soul collapsed into a single material person continues to be alive \(*jiva*\), but now as the “departed” \(*preta*\). It carries the “seeds” that will determine the “pattern” the preta will follow when it becomes time for it to weave a new “garment” for the soul \(*BG* 2.22\).

Figure 2.4 diagrams this set of three bodies, which will be considered again in chapter 7. These three sets of five sheathlike persons will be with us throughout this study, for they inform architecture, liturgy, and literature. Moreover, they are important to the concept of inner vision or dhyana.

## **Inner Vision \(*Dhyana*\)**

Teachings about Vasudeva, his formations, and his bodies are believed to derive from adepts or seers who achieve skill in inner vision \(*dhyana*\). Inner vision is a fundamental part of the discipline of devotion \(*bhaktiyoga*\), and the *Bhagavata Purana* frequently describes it. Dhyana pervades the poems of the Alvars, whose use of it most likely followed Agama rites now found in texts associated with the Emperor’s Vishnu-house, such as the *Satvata-samhita*, the *Jayakhya-samhita*, the *Padma-samhita*, and the *Ahirbudhnya-samhita*.15

The practice of inner vision begins with the discipline of the gross and subtle bodies through yoga. The adept practitioner of yoga \(*yogin*\) learns to enter a state of unified consciousness \(*yoga*\) that allows an internally unified perception called enstasy \(*samadhi*\). Enstasy results when waking consciousness in the person of the gross body unites with the person of life breath, the person of mental activity, and the person of subject-object perception to join the person of joy. The yogin employs his mental activity and his subject-object perception to visualize forms of God without looking outward through the sense organs of the gross physical body. By penetrating the forms he visualizes and entering the person of joy, who stands beyond both his perception of the object, he enters into enstatic consciousness \(*samadhi*\).

In some cases, for example among seers like Narada, Vasudeva may appear to the yogin’s joyous consciousness in a shape \(*rupa*\) that will benefit others who seek him. When the yogin returns to waking consciousness, he or she teaches the vision to others, as Narada did. This revealed vision then passes down through the knowledge called Agama. Gurus will teach it to their disciples so they may recreate it in their own minds and mentally worship it as part of their sadhana. Devout participation in God through enstasy is the highest mode of worship in Bhagavata Dharma. It may eventually lead to the direct perception—while awake—of God in all things and of all things in God. At death enstasy may lead the preta into a highly pure gross body for a final birth and death, or may lead it instead to “extinction in *brahman*” \(*brahmanirvana; BG* 2.54–72; 6\).

Nevertheless, inner vision is very difficult for most people to practice in this dark and passionate Kali Yuga. A less effective but more easily attainable alternative is to use ordinary eyesight to gaze on Vasudeva’s many revealed shapes, which painters, plasterers, wood carvers, and sculptors make into material forms \(*murti*\) which may serve as icons \(*archa*\). Devotees directing their visual attention to these grossly material bodies of God may worship easily. They may now employ the full range of their body, mind, and speech to harness their consciousness and guide it to the icon for devout participation in God. One example of such a Kali Yuga adaptation of bhaktiyoga is an architectural complex as richly envisioned and carefully executed as the Emperor’s Vishnu-house, which Tirumangai wrote about in the Tamil poem we should now examine.
