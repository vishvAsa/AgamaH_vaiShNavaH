  <p>The side facing south represents afternoon, beginning with midday at the southeast corner and ending with sunset at the southwest corner. Aniruddha the Unobstructed on the sanctum wall gazes through the central window of the enclosing vimana. Representations of his shakti or potency are on the vimana to his right (west), and representations of his tejas, or brilliant conquering power, are to his left (east). Aniruddha’s shakti, when embodied as mantras, may function as arrows (<em>astra</em>) deployed in ceremony (<em>kriya</em>) intended to produce worldly pleasure (<em>bhukti</em>), or emancipation (<em>mukti</em>), or both. Ceremonies intended to produce bhukti alone are called prayoga, “the hurling or casting of missiles”; and in specific contexts, the Bhagavan holds the wheel or chakra as a prayogachakra, with its rim facing the viewer, as if about to throw it. The wheel, whose name is Sudarshana (Pleasing in Apearance), appears in ceremonies as the wheel or chakra mandala inscribed on a flat surface, usually temporarily.</p>
<p>Prayoga rites deploy mantra missiles against rakshasas, who come from the south to attack humans in the north, and against asuras, who come from the west to attack devas in the east. The samdhya or juncture of south and west combines rakshasa and asura threats during sunset’s twilight, also called samdhya. Prayoga rites employ “language in the manner of twilight,” as Alex Wayman translates <em>samdhyabhasha</em> (Wayman 1973: 130). These rites counter demonic threats from west and south to preserve amrita’s prosperous longevity for devas in the east and humans in the north. Mohini holding the pot of amrita at the southwest corner of sunset signifies the shakti or potency of these prayoga rites and illustrates ritual “language in the manner of twilight.”</p>
<p>Bharata’s ambiguous and compromised history told in Book Nine of the <em>Bhagavata Purana</em> may be described as written in samdhyabhasha. The south-facing panels represent afternoon moving toward evening twilight (<em>samdhya</em>), and, as we learned earlier (at Panel E3), twilight is a voluptuous woman, the object of asuras’ eager desire (<em>lolupa</em>). As Wayman noted, twilight is a moment of ambiguity, contradiction, and paradox. In tantric sadhanas it symbolizes “the sensitive points in the temporal flow when spiritual victory was possible.”</p>
<p>Stories of Bharata’s history told “in the manner of twilight” express the ambiguity and paradox characteristic of the <em>Mahabharata</em> and of Krishna’s “death” in life toward which Book Nine leads. Krishna gave three major teachings about life in the midst of shadows. During an inauspicious pause of great uncertainty as the Great War began, he taught Arjuna the “Bhagavan’s Song” (<em>Bhagavad-gita</em>). Later, when a delirium of disorder was bringing the Dvapara Yuga to an end, he taught Uddhava “The Summary of the <em>Brahman</em> Doctrine” (<em>Brahmavadasya-samgraha</em>). Finally, just before he “died” through the absurd mistake of the hunter Old Age (Jara), he taught the <em>Bhagavatam</em>. All three teachings—the <em>Bhagavad-gita</em>, the <em>Brahmavadasya-samgraha</em>, and the <em>Bhagavatam</em>—are intended for devotees living in the impending darkness of the Kali Yuga, but Krishna taught them in the Dvapara Yuga, and south-facing panels therefore introduce them.</p>
<p>The two south-facing corner panels illustrate Dvapara Yuga “twlight” by stories told in “twilight language.” They allude, for example, to stories of Trishanku, Harishchandra, Rohita, and Shunahshepa (<em>BP</em> 9.7), which contain such paradoxical and puzzling events as males becoming females, females becoming males, males as females giving birth, and males as males giving birth. They tell of Kshatriyas becoming Brahmins, Kshatriyas becoming Shudras, and seers being both Kshatriyas and Brahmins. And they tell of a Kshatriya disciple caught midway between earth and heaven by the rivalry of two Brahmin priests; his son and his wife, however, attain knowledge of atman by sacrificing a human substitute for their son in a shrauta ritual conducted by the two rival Brahmins.</p>
<p>The theme of a male who becomes a female appeared in east-facing panels (Panel E6); here facing south it continues through the story of the Kali Yuga’s origin in a man’s pretense at being pregnant. When Krishna’s son Samba pretended to be pregnant, he and others taunted Brahmins and were cursed in return. Samba then gave birth to an iron pestle. It was ground up and thrown into the sea, only to emerge in reeds and in an iron lump swallowed by a fish. Once extracted from the fish, the iron lump became the arrowhead that pierced Krishna’s ankle and “killed” him. The reeds containing iron became clubs with which Yadavas beat each other to death in a drunken brawl at the tirtha called Splendor (Prabhasa). The demon Kali then emerged at Prabhasa to rule Bharata unobstructed (<em>BP</em> 11.1).</p>

<h3 id="panel-s1-dattatreya-sits-with-soma-and-durvasas"><em><strong>Panel S1: Dattatreya Sits with Soma and Durvasas</strong></em></h3>
<p>THE STORY. Chandra or Soma, Dattatreya, and Durvasas are avatars of portions (<em>amsha</em>) of the trimurti: The atman is the sustaining and pervasive Vishnu, the destroying ruler (Isha) is Shiva, and the self-transforming creator is Brahma (<em>BP</em> 4.1.15–33).1 Their portions descended to Bharata during the first manvantara of our kalpa, while Svayambhuva Manu’s children were populating the earth (<em>BP</em> 4.1.15–33) and filling the positions of planets and stars, including the days and hours they measure (<em>BP</em> 4.1; 6.6.1–2, 23–24). Svayambhuva Manu’s granddaughter Anasuya gave them birth. Her husband Atri, in order to fulfill his duty to propagate, stood on one foot without food for a hundred years in the eastern Vindhyas near the Nirvindhya River (<em>BP</em> 4.1.17).2 With his breath and mind under control, he took refuge in the Ruler of the Moving Universe (Jagadishvara) and asked for a son equal to the Ruler. When the tapas fire eventually emerged from the top of Atri’s head to threaten the three worlds of rebirth (<em>tribhuvana</em>), the trimurti’s splendid devas appeared to him, Brahma on the swan, Vishnu on the kite bird, and Shiva on the bull. Atri prostrated before the triad and begged for an explanation: “You are Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva, and in every age (<em>yuga</em>) you assume forms through the ‘threads’ of maya to emanate, preserve, and dissolve. But I have been concentrating on only one Bhagavan. Why have all of you come?”</p>
<p>They replied: “We are the <em>brahman</em> of the true resolve (<em>satsankalpa</em>) you have envisioned (<em>dhyayati</em>). You will have three sons born from a portion (<em>amsha</em>) of each of us. They will be world-famous and will spread your name everywhere.” In the context of Bharata, Atri learned, the Ruler of the Moving Universe is threefold; to equal him his wife had to produce triplets. Anasuya therefore gave birth to a portion of Brahma as Soma the Moon, to a portion of Vishnu the Knower of Yoga (<em>yogavid</em>) as Datta, and to a portion of Shiva as Durvasas.</p>
<p>Each of those devas corresponds to a dimension within the sadhaka. The seer Kapila identified Durvasas with the sense of “I” (<em>ahamkara</em>) and Chandra the Moon with mental activity (<em>manas</em>) and intellect (<em>buddhi</em>) (<em>BP</em> 3.26.60–61, 70). Datta, he said, represents the consciousness (<em>chitta</em>) of the Knower of the Field (<em>kshetrajna</em>) within the “heart” (<em>hridaya</em>), the atman that brings the body to life.3 Atman’s descent through Atri and Anasuya was named “He Gave” (Dattah) because, as he told Atri, “I gave (<em>datta</em>) myself as your son” (<em>BP</em> 2.7.4). Datta is commonly known as Dattatreya, “He Gave [Himself] through Atri.”</p>
<p>Dattatreya’s central position in the panel illustrates his preeminent status as the amsha avatara of the atman as Pervading Actor (Vishnu). He is famous for yoga and appears as a radical renunciant (<em>avadhuta</em>) two panels ahead (Panel S3). Kings worship him, notably Krishna’s ancestor Yadu (whom we shall discuss at Panel S3) and Yadu’s descendent, the Haihaya ruler named Arjuna, the son of Kritavirya, and therefore also known as Kartaviryarjuna (<em>BP</em> 2.7.4). Arjuna is the disciple of Dattatreya. Due to his guru’s grace he is supreme in sacrifice, giving, asceticism, self-discipline, learning, prowess, and victory. He lives 85,000 years of pleasure and wealth, and has 1,000 arms and a might so great that he captures and imprisons ten-headed Ravana like a monkey in a cage. But out of arrogance Arjuna craves the wealth bestowed by Kamadhenu, the cow kept in the ashram of the Bhrigu rishi Jamadagni, whose youngest son Rama is a portion of Vasudeva. Arjuna steals the cow Kamadhenu and this leads Rama to slay Arjuna with his battle-axe (<em>parashu</em>), and Rama is therefore known as Parashurama, Rama with the Axe. Rama then slays Arjuna’s 10,000 sons, except for five; they continue the Lunar Dynasty through the Madhavas, Vrishnis, and Yadavas, who produce the Satvata lineage to which Balarama and Krishna belong (<em>BP</em> 9.23.19–38; 9.24). Rama later attacks the Kshatriyas twenty-one times and slays them all except for Mulaka, who dresses as a woman and hides; he regenerates the Solar Dynasty (<em>BP</em> 9.9.40–41; 9.15–16.27).</p>
<p>In the <em>Markandeya Purana</em>, a Brahmin boy named Sumati tells this story of the three sons of Atri and Anasuya to his Bhrigu father, who until now believed him to be too stupid (<em>jada</em>) to learn the Vedas. But “Jada” Sumati actually remembers more than ten thousand births in all kinds of wombs, and possesses wisdom beyond any need for Vedic learning. He becomes his father’s guru and teaches him about the processes of death and rebirth, and about Yama’s Naraka realms of purgatory (<em>MP</em> 10–15). Jada tells his father the story about Soma, Dattatreya, and Durvasas in a way that differs little from the <em>Bhagavata Purana</em> account, except that he adds more information about Dattatreya. Jada says the he is such a great yogin that he has a wife, he has sexual intercourse with her, he drinks liquor with her, and he enjoys singing and music with her. But all the while he remains pure, just as Matarishvan the fire remains pure in the houses of corpse-burning chandalas (<em>MP</em> 16–17). Jada then tells his father about two of Dattatreya’s royal devotees, one of whom is Kritavirya’s son Arjuna, and the other is not King Yadu but a king named Alarka.</p>
<p>According to Jada, Arjuna agrees to assume the throne after his father dies only if he can protect his realm with the power of a yogin. In order to gain this power, the sage Garga tells him to worship Dattatreya; he explains why with the story of Indra and his devas after they had been defeated by the asura named Jambha. After this defeat Indra goes for help to Dattatreya’s ashram, where he finds gandharvas singing to the great yogin as he sits eating and drinking with Goddess Lakshmi. When Indra venerates Dattatreya and asks him to defeat Jambha on his behalf, Dattatreya asks why devas think he can help since he drinks alcohol, eats food, consorts with a woman, and is impure—even though he knows all things and is even-minded at all times. Indra protests that in fact Dattatreya is a sinless Brahmin, and that Lakshmi is the mother of the world and pure as the sun. This pleases Dattatreya, and he tells the devas to bring him Jambha and the asuras. When the asuras arrive and see the beautiful Lakshmi seated to Dattatreya’s left their lust blazes up, they forget their deva enemies, and they decide to take the Goddess away with them in a palanquin carried on their heads. Lakshmi sits down inside the palanquin, the asuras place it on their heads, and instantly Dattatreya renders them impotent—for they have touched another man’s wife—and the devas slay them all. Lakshmi flies back to Dattatreya and Indra returns to heaven. This, Garga concludes, is why Arjuna should worship Dattatreya for the sake of sovereignty unequaled by anyone.</p>
<p>Arjuna follows Garga’s advice. He goes to Dattatreya’s ashram, affirms that Dattatreya is sinless, and that his Brahmin wife Lakshmi is the path of all existence. Dattatreya is pleased. The yogin tells Arjuna that whoever worships him and Lakshmi with offerings of meat, liquor, and sweets, accompanied by songs and music, and venerates Brahmins, will receive his worldly blessings and protection. He offers Arjuna a boon. Kritavirya’s son asks for many things, including universal and prosperous sovereignty, the dexterity of a thousand arms, death from a superior man, and unwavering faith in Dattatreya. Arjuna receives it all. He assumes his father’s throne as the sole protector of his realm and the only man who wields a weapon (<em>MP</em> 18–19).</p>
<p>Jada’s next lesson to his father is about the king named Alarka. In the <em>Bhagavata Purana</em>, Alarka descends through Pururavas from the portion of Vasudeva named Dhanvantari, who brings amrita during the Churning of the Milk Ocean, and Alarka is uniquely famous for ruling 66,000 years with the freshness of youth (<em>BP</em> 9.17.1–7). In Jada’s account he is the fourth and youngest son of Kuvalayashva and his wife Madalasa. Kuvalayashva loves Madalasa, but before they can marry she dies. Shiva’s grace, however, gives her rebirth in her same form as daughter of the naga named Ashvatara ruling in Patala under Earth (<em>MP</em> 20–24). Madalasa, now the daughter of the naga Ashvatara, marries Kavalayashva and they have four sons. She teaches the first three about the impermanent nature of the body, and none of them wants to be a householder obligated to perform its numerous required ceremonies. Kuvalayashva thus has no heir to the throne, so he urges his wife to teach their fourth son not how to be a renouncer but how to be householder, and a ruler who nourishes his pitri ancestors. Madalasa dutifuilly teaches their son Alarka three subjects: the dharma of ritual class and stage of life; the ritual duties of the householder, with special attention to shraddha rites for the pitri ancestors of various types; and the proper behavior for each day, concluding with shraddha rites again (<em>MP</em> 25–35).</p>
<p>Alarka follows his mother’s teaching, marries, begets children, and when his father dies assumes the throne. But his mother gives him one final instruction inscribed on a gold ring, and tells him to read it when the pain of loss intrinsic to the householder life becomes intolerable. Alarka rules with righteousness (<em>dharma</em>) and prosperity (<em>artha</em>), but becomes overly attached to pleasure (<em>kama</em>). His brother Subahu contrives to teach him a lesson by having the king of Kashi join him in attacking Alarka’s realm. This joint assault causes Alarka intolerable losses, and he reads the gold ring. It advises him to seek relief in Dattatreya. He does this, and Dattatreya teaches him the falsity of the thought “This is mine” and “This am I”; he also instructs him in the practice of yoga. Alarka gives his kingdom to his son and leaves to seek emancipation in the forest. Jada concludes this story by advising his father to follow Alarka’s example. Father and son then become sannyasins (<em>MP</em> 36–44).</p>
<p>THE PANEL. The tripartite horizontal and vertical divisions of this badly damaged panel signal Aniruddha the Unobstructed as the third formation (Figure 15.1). The scene portrays Dattatreya seated in the middle of three horizontal levels, his brother Soma to his right and his brother Durvasas to his left. Each has one pair of arms and sits in the royal posture of ease with one leg pendent. Dattatreya, slightly taller than his brothers, is the axis of the panel, and faces directly south as the center of attention. The foot of his pendent left leg rests on a footstool carried on the head of a short plump male. He forms badly damaged mudras with his hands at his chest. Soma and Durvasas turn toward Dattatreya in mirroring postures: one leg is pendent and the foot of the other leg rests on Dattatreya’s footstool; one hand rests on the seat and the other hand forms a badly damaged mudra at the chest.</p>
<p>FIGURE 15.1. Panel S1: Dattatreya sits with Soma and Durvasas. IFDI.</p>
<p>At the bottom level of the panel are four males with one pair of arms each. The <em>Markandeya Purana</em> account provides their identities. Two males dressed royally and crowned stand on each side of the fraternal triad, the king Arjuna son of Kritavirya beneath Soma’s right arm, and the royal rishi Alarka beneath Durvasas’s left arm. They are in mirrored postures: Both gaze upward toward Dattatreya, gesture toward him with an open hand, and rest the other hand on a hip. Alarka’s Bhrigu Brahmin father kneels on his right knee beneath Soma’s foot; he holds the anjalimudra as he listens to the teaching of his son, Jada Sumati, who is depicted as an ascetic with tied-up matted hair. He sits in a cross-legged posture beneath Durvasas’s foot and gestures upward toward Dattatreya with his open right hand.</p>
<p>The upper level of the panel portrays three males flying. The one directly above the head of Dattatreya emphasizes the panel’s vertical axis: He emerges from behind Dattatreya’s head and looks slightly downward with the anjalimudra. The figure flying to his right raises his open left hand high in a salute of praise, and the figure to his left positions both hands at the level of his chest with indistinct gestures.</p>
<p>THE PANEL’S MEANINGS. The three males on the panel—Soma, Dattatreya, Durvasas—direct us to the stories of the Solar and Lunar dynasties introduced in the previous depiction of Ilavrita. They are the contents of Books Nine, Ten, and Eleven of the <em>Bhagavata Purana</em>, and assume a knowledge of the wars of the <em>Ramayana</em> and of the <em>Mahabharata</em>, themselves repetitions on Bharata of the persistent wars between the devas and asuras. More precisely, the <em>Ramayana</em> tells of a north-south conflict: the rakshasa kin of the asuras in southern Lanka led by Ravana oppose humans in northern Ayodhya led by Vishnu incarnated in four brothers. The <em>Mahabharata</em>, however, tells of an east-west conflict: Asuras as the one hundred sons of “blind darkness” oppose devas as the five sons of the “moon’s pale light.” Vishnu intervened in the <em>Ramayana</em> to achieve a decisive victory and a rule of 11,000 years, whereas in the <em>Mahabharata</em>, Vasudeva himself appeared as Krishna to guide the five Pandavas. Yet his victory, fraught with ambiguity and compromise, was less decisive than Rama’s; ambiguity and compromise appear in all the stories of the south-facing panels.</p>
<p>This panel signifies the tejas of Aniruddha the Unobstructed, Vasudeva’s third formation. It also signifies the instrumental value of this tejas for the king, who is the paradigmatic householder for his realm. As in the case of Dattatreya with Goddess Lakshmi, this tejas is beyond the categories of pure and impure; and as in the case of Arjuna, the king can use it to rule with sovereign power for good or for ill. Moreover, this panel represents the value of dharma, artha, and kama in the householder way of life, and the householder’s importance to future generations entangled in samsara. Among the householder’s duties it emphasizes shraddha rites, whose offerings to the pitri ancestors are made in the afternoon represented by this southern side of the vimana (<em>MP</em> 34.74).</p>
<p>The panel thus alludes to collections (<em>samhita</em>) of the Pancharatra Agama that teach the application of mantras to practical matters of living (<em>prayoga</em>). Brahma in the form of Soma the Moon (or Chandra) points to the <em>Padmasamhita;</em> Brahma learned it at the beginning of the Padma Kalpa from Narayana as Keshava, and taught it to Kapila (<em>BP</em> 3.4.13; <em>PS</em> 1.1–34; Smith 1975: 199). Rudra Shiva in the form of Durvasas points to the teaching Durvasas overheard when Rudra as “serpent of the deep” (<em>ahirbudhnya</em>) taught Narada the <em>Ahirbudhnya-samhita</em>. Shaiva tantrics regard Durvasas as teacher of Shivajnana, who divided the Shaiva Agama into three lineages: Tryambaka (monism), Amardaka (dualism), and Shrinatha (monism-cum-dualism) (Smith 1975:44; Davis n.d.). Vishnu in the form of Dattatreya in the middle represents the <em>Paushkara-samhita</em>, one of the oldest agamas of the Pancharatra, classified along with the <em>Satvata-samhita</em> and the <em>Jayakhya-samhita</em> as one of “three gems.” The <em>Paushkara-samhita</em> is relevant to the acharya’s consecration (<em>Paushkara-samhita</em> 1.1–32; Smith 1975: 278; 295–296).</p>
<p>Early inscriptional evidence for the worship of Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva as the “triad of material forms” (<em>trimurti</em>) comes from the Pallava realm in the first half of the seventh century.4 The panel depicts the Bhagavata version of the Trimurti to introduce the Bharata region during the seventh manvantara in which we live under the rule of Manu Vaivasvata, the son of Sun. As we recall, Vaivasvata was the rebirth of the Pandya king Satyavrata, whom Fish rescued at the end of the previous kalpa. According to <em>Paushkara-samhita</em> 36, Satyavrata was also a name for Kanchipuram (Smith 1975: 290). Specific events in Kanchipuram during Nandivarman’s rule may be among the many meanings of this and following south-facing panels.</p>
<p>This panel also represents the solution to the inevitable pain of the householder life. As in the case of Alarka’s three brothers, the yogin’s perception of the distinction between matter (<em>prakriti</em>) and soul (<em>purusha</em>) extinguishes any concern for the continuation of death and birth in samsara. As the rishi Kapila explains in the <em>Bhagavata Purana</em>, the three sons of Atri and Anasuya represent dimensions of consciousness within the sadhaka: Dattatreya is the consciousness (<em>chitta</em>) of the atman within the heart; this consciousness brings the material body to life and is the basis for its other dimensions. Soma is mental activity (<em>manas</em>) and intellect (<em>buddhi</em>). Durvasas is the ego awareness, “This am I” (<em>BP</em> 3.26.60–61; 70). The panel depicts these relationships visually: Dattatreya is the atman’s consciousness placed in the center as the basis for the Soma mind and intellect to his right, and for the Durvasas ego to his left.</p>
<p>Aside from the central role of Dattatreya, Durvasas and Soma are significant to the Dvapara Yuga of this southern side, and to the concerns of afternoon twilight leading to the Kali Yuga on the side of the mandala facing west. Durvasas’s curse leads to the churning of the Milk Ocean, the emergence of Dhanvantari with amrita, and the appearance of Mohini depicted at the southwest corner (<em>BP</em> 8.5.16). Durvasas gives the mantras to Vasudeva’s sister, Pritha or Kunti, which leads to the Great War of the <em>Mahabharata</em> (<em>MBh</em> 1.104–115; van Buitenen 1: 240–259). Durvasas uses his skill in improper abhichara rites directed against King Ambarisha, but when this backfires he learns the importance to ritual performance of the protective power of the wheel Sudarshana (<em>BP</em> 9.4–5). Durvasas learns more about Sudarshana when he overhears Rudra teach Narada about this wheel, as related in the <em>Ahirbudhnya-samhita</em> of the Pancharatra Agama (Smith 1975: 43–44).5</p>
<p>The panel also appears to gloss the story of Arjuna son of Kritavirya as told in the <em>Bhagavata Purana</em>. In that account, Arjuna possesses 1,000 arms and is slain by Parashurama. But in the <em>Markandeya Purana</em> account illustrated here, Arjuna has two arms and asks for “the dexterity of a thousand arms,” and for “death from a superior man.” This telling assumes that the audience already knows the account in the <em>Bhagavata Purana</em>, and that the “superior man” is Parashurama. It suggests a metaphorical interpretation of Arjuna’s 1,000 arms, and of the entire Parashurama story.</p>
<p>This panel also encodes the end of the Krishna story. Chandra the Moon alludes to the bathing place (<em>tirtha</em>) called Prabhasa (Splendor) on the western coast, for Moon bathed there to be freed of periodic wasting away (<em>BP</em> 11.6.34–38). This is why the tirtha is known as Splendor, but it is a twilight splendor, because Prabhasa is where the Yadavas destroyed themselves, Balarama and Krishna “died,” the Lunar Dynasty disappeared, and where the asura Kali took over Bharata for the Kali Yuga represented ahead on the west.6 The panel thus introduces the south-facing side as the Dvapara Yuga “afternoon” leading to the Kali Yuga “nighttime” facing to the west.</p>
<h3 id="panel-s6-mohini-serves-the-devas-amrita-as-the-asuras-watch"><em><strong>Panel S6: Mohini Serves the Devas Amrita as the Asuras Watch</strong></em></h3>
<p>THE STORY. The story of Mohini feeding amrita to devas ends the churning of the Ocean of Milk episode (<em>BP</em> 8.5–12), which began with a curse Durvasas put on Indra. As narrated at the panel of the Milk Ocean churning on the middle floor (Panel 7), once the amrita appeared in Dhanvantari’s hands, an asura snatched it, leaving devas to appeal for help to Vishnu. He appeared in the form of the woman who infatuates males (Mohini). That event is crucial to the churning story and plays not only on asura sexual passion but also on Shiva’s (<em>BP</em> 8.8–9, 12).</p>
<p>After asuras obtained the amrita they started to quarrel over who would drink it first (<em>BP</em> 8.8.38–40). Weaker asuras feared they would get nothing and argued that devas should get a share too. The Pervading Actor (Vishnu), ruler of the knowledge of all means, then appeared as a stunning and alluring female who aroused heated passion in the asuras’ minds (<em>BP</em> 8.8. 41–46).</p>
<p>In a scene evoking Twilight’s first appearance to asuras (Panel E3), the asuras exclaimed over her beauty (<em>BP</em> 8.9.1–7) and asked her to divide the amrita between them and devas to avoid future disputes between Kashyapa’s two lineages. Mohini cunningly asked, “Why do you trust me, a courtesan who solicits men? No lasting relationship can be formed with women who always look for new experiences in sex” (<em>BP</em> 8.9.9–10). Reassured by those enticing remarks, the asuras laughed knowingly and handed her the jar of amrita. With a smile she said, “If you agree to whatever I do, whether you think it holy or unholy (<em>sadhu-asadhu</em>), only then will I distribute it.” Without further thought the asuras agreed.</p>
<p>Devas and asuras now prepared themselves ritually for the distribution (<em>BP</em> 8.9.14–15).7 They fasted and bathed, offered oblations into the fire, distributed food to cows, to Brahmins, and to other beings, and had Brahmins bless them. The donned gorgeous new clothes and sat on kusha grass with the ends pointing to the east. Hari as the sensually enticing courtesan then appeared. In Tapasyananda’s words, “Into the hall now entered that handsome woman with vase-like breasts, holding the Amrita jar in hand. A brilliant cloth of silk draped the lower part of her body. Her tread was slow, and her eyes unsteady as if under inebriation, and the sweet sounds of her tinkling anklets announced her slow movement. As the Devas and Asuras smiled and looked carefully at that female form assumed by the Deity to match Sri Herself, they were stupefied with excitement to see her face illumined by ear ornaments and beautified by her handsome cheeks, ears and nose, and her torso from which the end of her clothes covering the breasts had slipped down” (<em>BP</em> 8.9.17–18; Tapasyananda 1980–1982 2: 333).</p>
<p>The master of the moving universe (<em>jagatpati</em>) organized the asuras and devas into separate rows. She then walked through the rows of asuras with the pot of amrita and beguiled them with her eyebrows, her bashful smiles, the play of her clothes and ornaments, and her flattering words; all the while, however, she was feeding amrita to the devas sitting at a distance. The asuras kept their pledge not to object, because they desired her and because they thought it demeaning to quarrel with a woman.</p>
<p>But one asura named Svarbhanu sneaked into the midst of the devas, sat down between Sun and Moon, and drank a portion of amrita. Sun and Moon immediately found him out and revealed his identity. Hari cut off Svarbhanu’s head with the Sudarshana wheel, but since he had already drunk amrita, his head was now “immortal.” It became the celestial “grasper” (<em>graha</em>) named Rahu, who in revenge attacks Sun and Moon as eclipses, but is invariably frightened away by Sudarshana (<em>BP</em> 8.9.24–27).8 Having now attained his goal, the sustainer of the world resumed his own shape (<em>rupa</em>) before the asuras and departed on Garuda (<em>BP</em> 8.9.27–29; 8.10.1–2).9</p>
<p>After Shuka told the story of Mohini’s distribution of amrita to devas, he told of Indra’s defeat of Bali, and then of Shiva’s encounter with Mohini. When that Ruler of Mountains (<em>girisha</em>) heard that Mohini had infatuated asuras, he went on his bull with Devi and his bhutas to the dwelling place of the Slayer of Deluded Passion (<em>madhusudana</em>); that place corresponds to this western half of the vimana facing south (<em>BP</em> 8.12.1–11).10 Hari welcomed them warmly, seated them, and graciously heard Shiva’s request. The Great God (<em>mahadeva</em>) first praised Hari with a metaphysical statement of his transcendent identity and then stated his reason for coming (<em>BP</em> 8.12.4–11). He had seen the Bhagavan’s many avatars in the past, Shiva said, and now would like to see the form in which he completely infatuated (<em>sammohita</em>) asuras. With a smile, the Bhagavan Vishnu said he would show him the form that excites those who have erotic desire (<em>kama</em>), a form that is to be greatly respected by those resolved to arouse it (<em>BP</em> 8.12.16). Vishnu then disappeared.</p>
<p>Shiva stood with Uma and at first saw nothing. Then a garden of blossoming trees appeared, and its midst a woman was playing with a ball. In Tapasyananda’s words,</p>
<p>She had the noble appearance of a high-born lady, was dressed in silk, and had a golden girdle round her waist. As she took each step with her tender legs while pursuing the up and down movements of the ball, now stooping, now lifting up her body, it appeared that her slender middle region would break under the weight of her tremulous breasts and the precious pearl necklaces on her neck. The pupils of her long and quivering eyes moved excitedly and fast in pursuit of the unpredictable ball straying in different directions and the beauty of her face was enhanced by her bluish curls and by the luminous reflection of her ear-pendant on her smooth cheeks. The inherent charm she displayed as she held her loosening cloth and braids with her handsome left hand while striking the ball with the other, was sufficient to blind the whole world with excitement. (<em>BP</em> 8.12.18–21)</p>
<p>She glanced at Shiva seductively, and he was completely overwhelmed, forgetting even Uma and the bhutas. The woman suddenly started to chase the ball and the wind blew away her light garment. Shiva was now transfixed and sexually aroused. While Uma watched, he ran toward the woman as she ran bashfully into the trees. In hot pursuit, Shiva was kama’s slave and no longer able to control his senses. He grabbed the woman’s hair and embraced her against her will, covering her as a bull elephant covers its mate. But she was maya. She struggled, released herself, and despite her heavy hips ran on with disheveled hair. Still overwhelmed by kama, Shiva pursued the running Vishnu of marvelous deeds, as a bull follows a cow in heat, and his potent semen (<em>retas</em>) fell on the ground as he ran. Wherever it fell it turned into gold and silver ore. Shiva chased her on the banks of rivers and lakes, on mountains, and in forests and gardens, wherever seers live. When he had ejaculated all his semen and recovered from his infatuation, Shiva realized that God’s maya (<em>devamaya</em>) had completely deluded him. But he was not surprised, for he knew that the atman of the moving universe (<em>jagadatman</em>) was his own atman.</p>
<p>The Slayer of Deluded Passion (<em>madhusudana</em>) as Mohini saw that Shiva felt no remorse or shame and was pleased. He resumed his male form to praise him: “Although you were completely infatuated by my maya in a woman’s form, you have resumed your normal freedom from passion. Who else can do that? This maya shall never again overpower you.” With that blessing, Shiva and his hosts circumambulated the Bhagavan with the shrivatsa on his chest and returned to Kailasa. There Shiva reminded Bhavani that she had once asked him whom he had meditated on for a thousand years in yoga. “It is he,” Shiva now explained, “the ancient Person beyond Time and beyond Veda” (<em>BP</em> 8.12.41–44).</p>
<p>THE PANEL. The panel is divided into vertical halves, with devas occupying the entire eastern half and Mohini and asuras the western half (Figure 15.2).</p>
<p>FIGURE 15.2. Panel S6: Mohini serves the Devas amrita as the asuras watch (prior to repair). IFDI.</p>
<p>Mohini nevertheless dominates the scene, for the panel’s central axis runs along her left side, and she is the largest figure. Mohini wears a crown and turns slightly toward the east, her knees bent, and her left foot placed behind her right foot in a graceful serving posture. She has one pair of arms. Her left hand holds the pot of amrita at the level of her waist as her right hand grasps its top. She looks directly south at the viewer while tilting her head slightly eastward. Mohini’s full breasts and wide hips reveal her delusive sensuousness as a pumshchali or harlot dazzling asuras.</p>
<p>Three asuras aligned vertically crowd the panel’s edge on Mohini’s right (west). At the top stands the crowned asura king Bali, and at the bottom sits an asura waiting to be fed. Devas sit in rows to Mohini’s left (east) and face directly south. The middle figure at the bottom sits with his hands in his lap to receive the amrita. He may be the asura Svarbhanu, who will become the graha Rahu; if so, the two devas sitting slightly behind him are Soma to his right (west) and Surya to his left (east). Above these three stand two devas wearing crowns; the tallest is Indra’s. A male above him appears to hold the anjalimudra to articulate Indra’s veneration of Mohini. Above Mohini, a male whose left arm and hand are obliterated similarly articulates her act of serving amrita; his right hand appears to form the mushtimudra (mudra of the fist), which has the same shape as the balimudra (mudra of power or mudra of offering): the fingers bend to the palm and the thumb curls over the forefinger (<em>PS</em> 1974: 46 and 107). This mudra refers to the amrita contents of the pot Mohini holds in her hands, for the amrita is the bali, the powerful offering that is shakti or potency.</p>
<p>THE PANEL’S MEANINGS. The three vertical divisions of this panel (asuras, Mohini, and devas) signify Aniruddha, Vasudeva’s third formation.</p>
<p>Mohini depicted here at the corner of sunset signifies this formation’s shakti, the potency of mantras employed in prayoga ceremonies to defeat rakshasas and asuras and preserve the “immortality” of prosperous longevity for devas and for humans. Furthermore, Mohini at this western corner of the mandala’s southern side complements Dattatreya at its eastern corner. Both transcend the sensuality by which they bestow worldly blessings, but in differing ways. Dattatreya uses his siddhi powers as a perfected yogin to confer tejas on universal sovereigns such as Arjuna and Alarka, yet remains pure and even-minded throughout. Mohini uses her own lolupa body of eager desire instrumentally to manipulate asura lust and preserve deva prosperity, but she never desires.</p>
<p>Mohini serving amrita to devas illustrates in part Krishna’s statement at the end of his “Summary of the <em>Brahman</em> Doctrine” represented on this southern side by Panel S3. Krishna tells Uddhava, “This is the intelligent judgment of the wise and prudent, that one reaches Me, the True One, the Immortal One, by means of a false mortal [body] here [in this world]” (<em>BP</em> 11.29.22). Mohini in this panel depicts Vishnu’s skill in means: By means of his maya he manipulates the lust of the householder’s false mortal body to attain bhukti for him, and perhaps also mukti.</p>
<p>The panel ends the afternoon period begun by the southeast corner panel. The two previous panels, S4 and S5, denote periods in the afternoon leading to twilight, as we shall see, and the Mohini story alludes back to early and late afternoon. Shuka identified those afternoon periods through the Bhagavan’s murti names. Vishnu, which he used in the churning of the Milk Ocean, denotes the Tamil month Chittirai (Chitra), which corresponds to early afternoon. Madhusudana, which he used in telling of Mohini’s seduction of Shiva, denotes the month Vaikachi (Vaisakha), which corresponds to mid-afternoon.11 Mohini herself depicts the evening twilight.</p>
<p>Mohini in the shape of Twilight at this sunset corner evokes “language in the manner of twilight” or samdhyabhasha, a subject we introduced at the beginning of this chapter. At twilight an object may appear to be both what it is and something else altogether; a winding crack in a walkway may look like a snake. Similarly, “language in the manner of twilight” uses a word, instruction, or object to mean one thing in one context, and something else in another. The meaning depends upon the context of the performance—is it in the afternoon or at night? This twilight panel represents both possibilities. The story illustrated by this southwest corner panel, like the corner panel depicting Dattatreya with Soma and Durvasas, uses “language in the manner of twilight” to say many things at the same time.</p>
<p>As discussed at Panel E3, Twilight (<em>samdhya</em>) embodies Brahma’s erotic thoughts and feelings which caused him to “ejaculate” asuras from his loins. Twilight is a “terrible” (<em>ghora</em>) state of mind, one of eager desire (<em>lolupa</em>); possessing eager desire as their nature, asuras sought sexual union (<em>maithuna</em>) with Brahma their father (<em>BP</em> 3.20.23). When Brahma abandoned that “terrible” state of mind, it appeared as alluring Twilight, and asuras took her as their own. Similarly, when Mohini appeared to the asuras, she appeared as Twilight.12 Mohini here at the southwest thus signifies eager desire (<em>lolupa</em>) which agitates and overwhelms deluded minds as twilight leads into night.</p>
<p>An example of the use of “the language of twilight” is a refernce to “churning.” In the story of the churning of the Milk Ocean, which this Mohini panel concludes, the appearance of amrita, Mohini’s play with the asuras’ eager desire (<em>lolupa</em>), and her seduction of Shiva denote powerful but “unholy” aspects of prayoga.</p>
<p>In the last hour of night, mantra employed through disciplined breath control (<em>pranayama</em>) during visualization (<em>dhyana</em>) is “churning.” In predawn sadhana, breath control (<em>pranayama</em>) takes place after the sadhaka has divinized himself or herself through nyasa, a gesture of the right hand used to place Sudarshana in mantra form on various parts of the body. By means of nyasa, the sadhaka’s body is made into God’s body in order to visualize God beyond the body. The transformation appears to be this: Through nyasa the gross body becomes Brahma’s gross body of spacetime, with Meru as the spinal column; the subtle body’s central axis becomes Mandara churned by Vishnu; and consciousness permeating the subtle body becomes the Ocean infused with the Milk of mantra. The sadhaka’s pranayama using mantra to lead to dhyana is Vishnu’s churning of the Milk Ocean.</p>
<p>But in the first hour of night, pranayama using mantra and dhyana during sexual intercourse denotes “churning.” In this case, the male “churns” the female while using pranayama, mantra, and dhyana to transform eager desire (<em>lolupa</em>) into the instrumental means to obtain properous longevity (<em>amrita</em>). Early detailed descriptions of the rites appear in the <em>Brihadaranyaka Upanishad</em> (6.4); and the <em>Chandogya Upanishad</em> (2.13) teaches the <em>“Vamadevya Saman</em> woven upon sexual intercourse,” which leads to a full life span of prosperity and honor.</p>
<p>Moreover, this Mohini panel appears to allude to a well-known example of the type of ceremony commonly called tantric; it uses five offerings beginning in Sanskrit with the letter M, panchamakara. These offerings are called mamsa, matsya, mudra, madya, and maithuna. They literally mean flesh, fish, gram, wine, and coupling. Panchamakara ceremonies performed in a Bhagavata context in the recent past by the king of Puri in Orissa, as discussed by Frederique Marglin, open up possible hidden meanings of this panel (Marglin 1985; Hudson and Marglin 2002: 111–122). The king of Puri’s royal acharya supervised the afternoon panchamakara ceremony in the Jagannatha Temple, where Krishna as Lord of the Moving Universe and his brother Balarama and his sister Subhadra reside in icons carved of wood. The royal acharya performed the nighttime ceremony secretly, somewhere in the temple, or outside of it in a cremation ground or somewhere else.</p>
<p>The afternoon ceremony was meant for the welfare of the kingdom. It consisted of a vegetarian meal offered to Jagannatha accompanied by the dance of a devadasi, who faced south, as Mohini does here. In this meal, mamsa was a rice preparation, matsya was a vegetable dish, mudra was gram flour cakes, and madya was coconut milk. Maithuna was the “leavings of shakti,” vaginal drops that fell from the devadasi onto the ground while she danced. The nighttime ceremony was meant for goals specific to the king of Puri and was quite different. It was a nonvegetarian meal prepared and offered secretly. In this meal, mamsa was meat, matsya was fish, mudra was a gram preparation, and madya was wine. Maithuna was sexual fluid drawn by the acharya from a young woman and called “amrita.” The acharya mixed this “amrita” with the meat, fish, gram, and wine, placed the mixture in a conch shell called the Shri Patra, and added to it a bit of blood from a girl’s first menstruation. By means of mantras, the acharya made the Shri Patra conch shell the residence of Dakshinakalika, the Goddess whose name means Kalika of the South, or perhaps Kalika Facing South.</p>
<p>The acharya then dressed as a beautiful woman in a red sari, not unlike a courtesan who resembles Mohini. In this female guise the acharya evoked the tejas of Dakshinakalika from the Shri Patra conch and placed it onto a yantra. “She” then worshiped this tejas enthroned on the yantra with meat and wine offerings. Afterwards “she” fed pairs of men and women as “Viras” and “Shaktis” seated as a chakra wheel. This secret ceremony ended when all had worshiped the Goddess. It was believed that if this ceremony were performed correctly, the Goddess would deploy her tejas on behalf of the sponsoring king.</p>
<p>The panchamakara performances in Puri suggest three meanings hidden in this Mohini panel.13</p>
<p>1.Mohini’s graceful posture, facing south holding the amrita pot, evokes the devadasi, who likewise faces south during the afternoon meal offering, dancing as the panchamakara’s fifth component called maithuna.</p>
<p>2.Mohini’s beauty also evokes the acharya, who at night dresses as a beautiful woman and worships Dakshinakalika residing in “her” amrita pot called the Shri Patra.</p>
<p>3.Dakshinakalika residing in this Shri Patra, which the amrita pot at the visual center of this panel represents, is the potent shakti from which conquering tejas will emerge. We learn this from the <em>Devi Mahatmyam</em>. Vishnu’s maya takes shape as Parvati. When Parvati turns her gross material kosha or sheath into Kaushiki, the golden Goddess known as Chandika and Durga, she turns dark. This dark Parvati now dwells in the Himalayas as Kalika (<em>DM</em> 5. 83–89; Coburn 1991: 5.37–41). Kalika’s presence in the Himalayas explains Dakshinakalika to mean Kalika facing south, for she faces southward to protect Bharata. She is the potent shakti; the golden Chandka Durga who emerges from her is the conquering tejas.</p>
<p>The Mohini panel also alludes ahead to the next sequence of panels. The churning itself refers to Tortoise as represented by the panel around the corner (Panel W1); he held up the Mandara mountain while Vishnu churned the ocean. When lords of progeny asked Shiva to swallow the Kalakuta poison, they referred to his destruction of Daksha’s sacrifice; that story appears in the first panel on the porch (Panel SP1). The porch’s next two panels (Panels SP2 and SP3) probably depicted the lords of progeny’s similar allusions to Shiva’s destruction of Tripura and his burning of Kama, but one panel is missing and the other is damaged, and no unambiguous symbol identifies it.</p>
<p>The Mohini panel, moreover, alludes twice to the last south-facing panel at the porch’s southwest corner (Panel SP4). It depicts Upendra, Dwarf as Indra’s younger brother. One allusion is through the sequence of manvantaras. The churning of the ocean occurred in the sixth manvantara when Indra defeated Bali; that defeat led to Bali’s conquest of Indra, which in turn led to the appearance of Dwarf in the seventh manvatara. The other allusion is through the sequence of times that follow the late afternoon and evening. The murtis Trivikrama and Vamana represent sunset and early night. Both murti names refer to Dwarf (Vamana) as the one who made three strides (Trivikrama), measured out spacetime, and pushed Bali down into the nether worlds. After this Dwarf was honored as Upendra.</p>
<p>This last south-facing panel on the vimana (Panel S6) represents evening twilight to complement morning twilight on the north-facing corner panel diagonally opposite (Panel N1). Similarly, the first period of night denoted by the Upendra panel at the porch’s southwest corner (Panel SP3) complements the night’s final period (<em>brahmamuhurta</em>) denoted by the Hayagriva panel directly opposite on the northwest corner (Panel NP1).</p>
<h2 id="the-four-bracketed-panels"><strong>The Four Bracketed Panels</strong></h2>
<h3 id="panel-s2-krishna-in-dvaraka-teaches-uddhava-the-summary-of-the-brahman-doctrine"><em><strong>Panel S2: Krishna in Dvaraka Teaches Uddhava the “Summary of the Brahman Doctrine”</strong></em></h3>
<p>Two panels illustrate Krishna’s long “Summary of the <em>Brahman</em> Doctrine” (<em>Brahmavadasya-samgraha</em>): Krishna stands teaching Uddhava at Dvaraka (Panel S2), and Dattatreya as avadhuta stands teaching Yadu in the forest (Panel S3). The “Summary” (<em>BP</em> 11.6–29) alludes to other texts: to the earlier “Song of the Bhagavan” (<em>Bhagavad-gita</em>) that Krishna taught Arjuna on the Kuru field of dharma, to the <em>Bhagavatam</em> that Krishna taught Uddhava just before he died at Prabhasa (<em>BP</em> 3–4), and to the <em>Padma-samhita</em> of the Pancharatra Agama. H. Daniel Smith described the last as the Pancharatra text most widely used today and a complete introduction into “the intricacies of Pancharatra thought and practice” (Smith 1975: 197, 242). A coherent understanding of Bhagavata Dharma will include all four texts, but there is a hermeneutical problem arising from Krishna’s preference for the “invisible language” (<em>paroksha</em>) seers used for Veda’s “doctrine of the invisible” (<em>parokshvada</em>). That doctrine teaches <em>brahman</em> and atman in three topical categories (<em>BP</em> 11.21.35). Krishna’s preference matches “language in the manner of twilight,” which means that in these south-facing panels, nothing is quite what it seems. Our best course, therefore, is to pursue the hints narratives and statements offer regarding their “invisible” (<em>paroksha</em>) content.</p>
<p>The <em>Padma-samhita</em>, for example, is “invisibly” connected to the “Great Romance” and to the Mantrasiddhanta Path in the following manner.14 Keshava taught the <em>Padma-samhita</em> to Brahma, and it passed on in increasingly condensed forms to Kapila, to Padma in Patala, and to Samvarta at Kanva’s ashram. Samvarta was the son of Aurva who taught at Prabhasa. Samvarta thus connects Kanva to Prabhasa and to the <em>Padma-samhita</em> (<em>Jayakhya-samhita</em> 1; Smith 1975:114). The seer Kanva of the Lunar Dynasty was the foster father of Shakuntala, the mother of the famous emperor Bharata (<em>BP</em> 9.20.6–33), but he was also the father of a daughter named Indivaraprabha by the apsaras Menaka (Mani 1984: 176). Indivaraprabha married King Chandravaloka, father of Taravaloka, of the “Great Romance.” Indivaraprabha and Chandravaloka appear in that vast ocean of stories in a tale told by a vampire (<em>vetala</em>) in a cemetery at midnight to gain the status of a vidyadhara (van Buitenen 1959: 48–58). He told of a Brahmin boy who, just before he was sacrificed to a demon at the foot of a tree, laughed because he perceived the self-deception the body created—a statement of the south-facing perspective on tamas and death. Krishna, “slain” in Prabhasa at the foot of a tree shortly after he taught the <em>Bhagavatam</em>, was famous for a smile born of the same insight (<em>BG</em> 2.10).</p>
<p>According to the <em>Padma-samhita</em>, among the linages (<em>gotra</em>) of seers ardently seeking moksha, the Kanva branch, along with the Madhyandina branch, received consecration to the Mantrasiddhanta Path (<em>marga</em>), one of four taught by Brahma.15 Those who followed the Mantrasiddhanta Path apparently were Brahmins; they were consecrated to the sadhana of the “Wheel and Lotus Mandala” (<em>chakrabjamandala</em>), performed their own modes of the soma sacrifice and other rites, and had their own modes of visualizing and worshiping the Bhagavan, all without the desire for fruits (<em>PS</em> 4.21.2–12; 4.25–29; Smith 1975: 235–240). Moreover, the <em>Padma-samhita</em> listed among the most precious Pancharatra “gems” a text called the <em>Kanva-tantra</em> (<em>PS</em> 4.33.203–204; Smith 1975: 242). The Pancharatra liturgists in Nandivarman’s imperial court were probably Brahmins of the Kanva branch who followed the Mantrasiddhanta Path and delighted in Shiva’s “Great Romance.”</p>
<p>THE STORY. Shuka told the story of Krishna teaching Uddhava as part of his longer explanation of how Krishna “died,” his Yadava clan destroyed itself, and the Kali Yuga began. The narrative context of the panel is a visit Brahma and Shiva and other divine beings paid to Krishna in Dvaraka (<em>BP</em> 11.6.1–39). In this context, Shuka referred to him as Govinda, who had lived 125 years and had accomplished the purposes of his descent (<em>BP</em> 11.6.20. 11.6.25; 11.22.35). Due to a curse from Brahmins elicited by Samba, the Yadavas were now about to destroy themselves, and Brahma and Shiva had come to ask Krishna to return to his transcendent realm.</p>
<p>When they addressed Krishna, Brahma and Shiva connected the three of them to the transformed Trimurti of the previous panel (<em>BP</em> 11.6.7–19). They praised him as the source of their own functions, the Bhagavan himself, the controller of the three gunas who creates, protects, and destroys the manifest universe within himself through maya, yet is unaffected by those acts because of his own inherent pleasure (<em>sukha</em>). Nothing, they said, purifies the mind like listening to his glory.</p>
<p>Then they directed their veneration to Krishna’s feet, which, they said, six kinds of worshipers seek. Munis seek them in the seat of consciousness (<em>hridaya</em>) moist with love, as do prudent Satvatas desiring similarity with the four vyuhas in the manifestation of great power (<em>vibhuti</em>). The reflective (<em>chittah</em>), who worship three times a day to transcend heaven, seek his feet, as do sacrificers who follow three Vedas and think of the Trimurti while holding oblations for the fire in their hands. Yogins, who practice self-discipline to comprehend and control their own maya, also seek his feet, as do those who are supreme among Bhagavatas (<em>paramabhagavata</em>) (<em>BP</em> 11.6.10–11). Those six types of worshipers are discussed in Appendix 1.</p>
<p>Brahma and Shiva then addressed Krishna’s feet with their own requests. They asked that they purify them of their sins, just as they had encouraged devas and frightened asuras when they took three strides and brought Ganga into the world. They asked that they bring them well-being, for Krishna is the Supreme Person (Purushottama), the Ruler of purusha and prakriti who controls all contentious beings from great Brahma down to the smallest being, just as cowherds control contentious cattle through strings in their noses (<em>BP</em> 11.6.13–14). As Dattatreya’s middle position in the corner panel states, he controls Brahma and Shiva from within.</p>
<p>Brahma and Shiva praised Krishna as the material cause, the instrumental cause, and as Time-as the year with three seasons. He conceives the universe within himself, and as Ruler of Senses (Hrishikesha) is not entangled in the senses even when he enjoys the pleasures of his more than 16,000 wives. Two tirthas purifying sin flow from his feet, they concluded, the stories of his deeds and the waters of Ganga, and those who follow revelation (<em>shruti</em>) bathe in both (11.6.15–19). Krishna finally agreed to their request. He would return to Vaikuntha and would visit Brahma’s Satyaloka on the way.</p>
<p>After Brahma, Shiva, and the others left Dvaraka, evil omens appeared. Krishna urged the Yadava elders to take their people immediately to the tirtha at Prabhasa, where Moon had bathed to be freed of the pulmonary tuberculosis (phthisis) wasting him due to a curse by the lord of progeny Daksha. At Prabhasa, Krishna told them, they may cross the ocean of impending disaster by baths, by libations to the ancestors and devas, by feeding Brahmins, and by gifts to worthy men (<em>BP</em> 11.6.34–38).</p>
<p>Uddhava had seen and heard everything and anxiously approached Krishna for an explanation. As Krishna’s devotee from the age of five, Uddhava had long served as chief Vrishni commander and was his close friend (<em>BP</em> 3.2; 3.3.1–6) and an ideal Bhagavata (<em>BP</em> 11.16.29). When Uddhava realized that Krishna was going to “die” he asked to be taken home (<em>dhama</em>) with him, but quickly added that of course devotees like himself easily cross the darkness of samsara simply by serving him (<em>BP</em> 11.6.43). Uddhava described those devotees and, in doing so, reduced Brahma and Shiva’s six types to two, servants and renouncers (see Appendix 1).</p>
<p>In response to Uddhava’s anxiety about his imminent departure, Krishna urged him to renounce his householder life. Seven days from now, he said, the sea will submerge Dvaraka, and once he, Krishna, leaves Bharata the Kali Yuga will follow. He urged Uddhava not to stay for that unrighteous time, but to renounce his people and family, to follow him, to wander, and learn to see him in everything. Krishna then told Uddhava what such renunciation would be like (<em>BP</em> 11.7.6–12). He would learn to know that the world perceived by the senses is like the magic (<em>maya</em>) in a magic show. Controlling the senses and the mind, he would see the moving universe (<em>jagat</em>) in the atman and the atman in Krishna. When omniscient knowledge (<em>jnana</em>) and discriminatory knowledge (<em>vijnana</em>) fuse in the atman, Uddhava would experience the atman and nothing would then be an obstacle. He would live like an unfettered infant; without any sense of “ought” he would spontaneously avoid the harmful (<em>dosha</em>) and promote the favorable (<em>guna</em>), because he would see the world as the Bhagavan.</p>
<p>Uddhava, however, thought radical renunciation (<em>sannyasa</em>) would be difficult for him (<em>BP</em> 11.7.14–16). He acknowledged that Krishna is the Ruler of such self-control (<em>yogesha</em>), but described himself as immersed in the feeling that he <em>is</em> his body, and in the feeling that all those people connected to his body do in fact belong to <em>him</em>. Maya confounds all embodied beings from Brahma down, and everyone thinks that what is external to them is the only real thing. Uddhava nevertheless believed Krishna could help him overcome his delusion and formally took refuge in him: “Narayana the friend of Nara, the pure, endless, transcendent, omniscient Ruler, the eternal abode without delusion, I take refuge in you” (<em>BP</em> 11.7.18). Uddhava thus invoked the <em>Bhagavad-gita</em>, where Krishna cryptically identified himself as a form of Narayana and Arjuna as a form of Nara (<em>BG</em> 4.5). In response, Krishna taught Uddhava “The Summary of the <em>Brahman</em> Doctrine” (<em>Brahmavadasya-samgraha</em>) (<em>BP</em> 11.7–29). It was, in part, a commentary on the <em>Bhagavad-gita</em> and concluded with an explanation of that text’s “most important shloka” (<em>uttamashloka</em>), 18:66, which Krishna called “the eternal supreme secret of <em>brahman</em>” (<em>BP</em> 11.29.23 and 25).</p>
<p>When Krishna finished teaching Uddhava, he told him to go to the ashram at Badari where the seer Narayana teaches the seer Nara, and to live there as a renouncer according to the <em>“Brahman</em> Doctrine” (<em>Brahmavada</em>) as it applied to him (<em>BP</em> 3.4.22). With sobbing emotion, Uddhava placed Krishna’s sandals on his head, prostrated before him repeatedly, and left the way a worshiper leaves the Bhagavan’s icon in the temple’s vimana, by touching his head to his footstool (<em>BP</em> 11.29.46).</p>
<p>But Uddhava never left Krishna. He followed him as he left for Prabhasa and came upon him for the last time on the banks of the (west-flowing) Sarasvati River seated under a pipal (<em>ashvattha</em>) tree (<em>BP</em> 3.4). The seer Maitreya came there, too, and in Maitreya’s presence, Krishna taught Uddhava again. He called that second teaching the <em>Bhagavatam</em>, which he had imparted to Brahma during emanation in the Padma Kalpa (<em>BP</em> 3.4.13). The <em>Bhagavatam</em> reveals the atman’s highest state (<em>BP</em> 3.4.19). Its liturgical parallel is the <em>Padma-samhita</em>, which, as we noted, passed from Brahma to Samvarta in Kanva’s ashram (<em>PS</em> 1.1–24; Smith 1975: 199).</p>
<p>After Krishna’s final instruction, Uddhava witnessed his “death.” Later, while on his way to the ashram of Narayana and Nara in Badari, he met Vidura near the Yamuna River and told him of Krishna’s passing (<em>BP</em> 3.1.24–3.4). Vidura wanted to hear the <em>Bhagavatam</em>, but Uddhava said that its appropriate teacher was Maitreya, now living at Haridvara on the Ganga River.</p>
<p>THE PANEL. Krishna’s large figure is dressed in royal garments and wears a tall crown (Figure 15.3). He stands facing the viewer, but turns slightly toward Uddhava at his right. Krishna has two pairs of arms, as he does in the <em>Bhagavad-gita</em> (<em>BG</em> 11.46), and frequently in the <em>Bhagavata Purana</em> (e.g., <em>BP</em> 1.7.52, 9.30, 12.10; and 3.4.7–8). His back left hand holds the conch and his right hand the wheel as a prayogachakra. His front right hand at his chest forms what appears to be the mayamudra: the thumb and the ring finger touch (<em>PS</em> 1974: 16, no. 16). His front left hand rests on his left hip. Uddhava stands to Krishna’s right, likewise dressed in royal garments, the crown of his short form reaching to Krishna’s back right hand. Uddhava gazes up toward Krishna, forming the anjalimudra with his two hands as he listens to him teach the “Summary of the <em>Brahman</em> Doctrine.”</p>
<p>FIGURE 15.3. Panel S2: Krishna in Dvaraka teaches Uddhava the “Summary of the <em>Brahman</em> Doctrine.” AIIS.</p>
<p>Two male figures fly above Krishna and Uddhava, apparently to gloss the depictions below. The figure above Uddhava flies toward the center, gesturing praise with his open left hand raised up toward the male flying above Krishna. This figure (not seen in Panel S2, Figue 15.3) is positioned directly above Krishna’s head and likewise flies toward the center. But his right hand raised near his face forms the abhayamudra of protection, matching Krishna’s prayogachakra below.</p>
<p>THE PANEL’S MEANINGS. This panel represents Dvaraka, Krishna’s island realm in the western ocean, at the end of the Dvapara Yuga. Events in the Krishna Story now point forward to the imminent Kali Yuga represented by the vimana’s western side directly ahead.</p>
<p>This panel also represents the relation of Krishna as refuge to Uddhava as refugee (<em>prapanna</em>). This relationship of guru and disciple is a relationship of friends unequal in status. The intimate feelings Krishna has for his friend Uddhava prompts him as guru to teach him as his disciple. This relation will continue in the Kali Yuga as the relation of acharya to sadhaka. Moreover, this panel represents the “Summary of the <em>Brahman</em> Doctrine” contained in Book Eleven of the <em>Bhagavata Purana</em> (<em>BP</em> 11.7–29). Krishna teaches it for the sake of Bhagavatas who will live in the Kali Yuga soon to arrive.</p>
<p>The depiction of Krishna teaching Uddhava also alludes ahead to the corner panel of Mohini distributing amrita (Panel S6). Shuka contrasted the amrita of the “Summary” to the amrita churned up and distributed to devas:</p>
<p>The latter gives devas long and happy life, but condemns them to repeated death and birth, while the former is the death of that repeated death and birth. As the essence of jnana and vijnana, the “Summary” slays any anxiety (<em>bhaya</em>) about repeatedly coming into existence (<em>bhava</em>) (<em>BP</em> 11.29.49).</p>
<p>The story introduced by this panel ends with Maitreya teaching the <em>Bhagavatam</em> to Vidura, which constitutes Books Three and Four of the <em>Bhagavata Purana</em>. Maitreya first reviewed Krishna’s life for Vidura and then taught him about Brahma’s birth from the lotus (<em>padma</em>) at the beginning of the Padma Kalpa. Vidura the listener thus links the end of Krishna’s life, the onset of the Kali Yuga, and the emperor Parikshit’s rule narrated in Books Eleven, Twelve, One, and Two to Brahma’s lifetime unfolding in Books Three and Four. Maitreya telling the <em>Bhagavatam</em> to Vidhura appears to follow the <em>Padmasamhita</em> in general outline; <em>Bhagavata Purana</em> 3–4 is thus a narrative and metaphysical complement to the <em>Padma-samhita’s</em> liturgical concerns.</p>
<p>Vidura as the audience linking the end of Krishna’s life to the beginning of Brahma’s corresponds to his identity as the incarnation of Yama. That righteous deva of the dead rules in the south toward which this panel faces, and serves Bhagavatas (<em>BP</em> 3.5.20–22; 3.7.19–20).16 Except for them, those who live in the Kali Yuga are so obscured by ignorance and desire that they are almost inevitably condemned to Yama’s purgatorial realms in the south. But Bhagavatas need not fear him, and the way to be a Bhagavata is the content of “Summary of the <em>Brahman</em> Doctrine” and the <em>Bhagavatam</em> represented by this panel. Death thus appears in a highly auspicious context: Krishna’s teachings to Uddhava are for the sadhaka the “death of Death.” They are the Unobstructed formation’s brilliant conquering power (<em>tejas</em>).</p>
<p>Finally, the mayamudra Krishna forms in the panel with his right hand—if this is a correct interpretation—refers to the final goal of one who seeks to see truly. As he tells Uddhava, such a person will know that the world perceived by the senses is a trick of misperception like the maya of a magician’s performance.</p>
<h3 id="panel-s3-the-avadhuta-dattatreya-teaches-king-yadu"><em><strong>Panel S3: The Avadhuta Dattatreya Teaches King Yadu</strong></em></h3>
<p>THE STORY. This story is Krishna’s first lesson in his “Summary of the <em>Brahman</em> Doctrine.” Krishna told Uddhava about Dattatreya to illustrate that the intellect alone can lead one to knowledge of the atman (<em>BP</em> 11.7–9, esp. 11.7.19–23). Dattatreya, a radical Brahmin renouncer (<em>avadhuta</em>), taught King Yadu that one does not need revelation or commitment to a single guru to attain enlightened consciousness; intelligent use of keen observation and reflection will produce it. That teaching resembles the Buddhist bhikshu’s sadhana of disciplined reflection to perceive the opposite: the absence of atman (<em>anatman</em>).</p>
<p>King Yadu met Dattatreya wandering in the forest like a boy without a care. Yadu’s description of him (as translated by Tapasyananda) matches both the portrayal in the panel and that of the sant: “You are strong, learned, capable, handsome and eloquent. But you show no desire for anything, nor do you care to do any work. You merely wander about sometimes like a senseless man, sometimes as one inebriated, and sometimes like one possessed. While all men are being burnt in the fire of sexual craving and greed, you remain unaffected by it like an elephant that has plunged into the waters of the Ganga. O holy one! Kindly tell me what it is that fills your heart always with joy, though you are without any object of sense enjoyment and are companionless and alone” (<em>BP</em> 11.7.28–30; Tapasyananda 1980–1982 4: 39).</p>
<p>In the forest, Dattatreya told Yadu stories of his twenty-four gurus; each had taught him a specific lesson that led him to transcendent joy (<em>BP</em> 11.9.4). His gurus were the five material elements of earth, water, fire, wind, and space. They were the moon and the sun. They were doves, a python, the ocean, a river, a moth, a honeybee, an elephant, a man who gathered honey, a deer, and a fish. They were Pingala the courtesan, an osprey, a girl with bangles, an arrow-smith, a snake, a spider, and, finally, a wasp. Each guru caused him to use his own observation and reflection to attain a joy experienced by an innocent and ignorant child and by one who transcends the gunas. In a style resembling the Buddhist <em>Jatakas</em>, Dattatreya taught Yadu through folk tales, parables, and metaphors based on practical wisdom.</p>
<p>On first glance the panel appears to portray a bodhisattva as an avatar of the Bhagavan.17 Likewise, one may think it portrays Parshvanatha, the twenty-third Jaina tirthanhkara, because the enclosing nature of the curving form above his head suggests the snake hoods characteristic of Parshvanatha.18 Nevertheless, he is Dattatreya portrayed “in the manner of twilight” as avadhuta, muni, paramahamsa, bhikshu, or sannyasin. Krishna described avadhutas as bhikshus who usually wore something when among householders.19 One exception was Vyasa’s son Shuka, who taught the <em>Bhagavata Purana;</em> as an avadhuta he was completely naked in the presence of women at least once, but his nakedness was essential to that episode (<em>BP</em> 1.4.4–8).20 The renouncer’s nudity signifies consciousness beyond the dualities of gender, but his loincloth signifies respect for the feelings of householders. Krishna said the avadhuta carries a bamboo rod (<em>danda</em>), a walking stick that symbolizes control over mind, speech, and body. The “triple danda” is a single bamboo rod used to symbolize the three disciplines, or three rods bound together (<em>BP</em> 11.18.17; 11.18.40; 11.23.34).</p>
<p>King Yadu’s comment that Dattatreya is perpetually “cool” and not burning with the fire of sexual craving and greed like others alludes to a tradition about him not found in the <em>Bhagavata Purana</em>. According to Hariprasad Shivprasad Joshi, other accounts of the avadhuta Dattatreya describe him as attached to wine and women yet not defiled by them; he represents Agama rites of the “left-hand” (<em>vamachara</em>), which use wine and sexual intercourse as means to transcend normal consciousness. The woman, Joshi suggested, is the symbol of atman experience, and wine the pleasure arising out of it (Joshi 1965: 66–71).</p>
<p>In the <em>Markandeya Purana</em> (17.15–16; 23–25), Dattatreya enjoyed the objects of sense even while engaged in deep meditation, and sages were not put off by his wine and women. Dattatreya exemplifies a nonclinging stance toward the objects of senses while involved with them. With that stance, the sant moves freely among the polarities of purity and pollution, whether in the sensually aesthetic life of wealthy sophisticates or in the polluting life of corpse burners, all the while pure like Matarishvan, the household fire.</p>
<p>Visual “language in the manner of twilight” appears in the panel as as Dattatreya’s shaved head; no other figure on the temple has a shaved head. It suggests a bodhisattva bhikshu who will become a buddha. In Bhagavata belief, the Shakyamuni Buddha appeared early in the Kali Yuga as an avatar of Vishnu to delude asuras or “imposters” (<em>pakhanda</em>) with an attractive form and heretical doctrines (<em>BP</em> 1.3.24; 2.7.37).21 Positioned here, the panel alludes to the deceiving Buddha who will appear in the Kali Yuga to the west, where a Buddhist temple may once have stood in Kanchipuram’s center.</p>
<p>ALLUSIONS TO TARAVALOKA AND VESSANTARA. The panel’s visual focus on the avadhuta’s outstretched right hand evokes two figures in the Shibi lineage familiar to the temple’s eighth-century audience: Taravaloka of the “Great Romance” and Vessantara of the <em>Jatakas</em>. Their stories are almost exact parallels. According to karma doctrine, a person who attains enlightened consciousness through his or her own efforts, without a sadhana directed by a guru and without revealed teachings, does so because of significantly virtuous acts in previous lives. The most significant is giving (<em>dana</em>), as illustrated repeatedly in the stories of the first corner panel facing south. Taravaloka in the “Great Romance” was a paradigm for dana, which led to his imperial rule of the vidyadharas. He eventually renounced that rule in favor of tapas in the forest. Similarly, in the nearly identical Buddhist story of Vessantara, his dana gave him the Heaven of the Delighted (Tushita) and led him to tapas in the forest as the Shakyamuni (<em>Vessantara Jataka</em> 1977: xv–xvi). Moreover, the <em>tara</em> they share in their names links them to the female named Tara: In Bhagavata lore she is the wife of Moon and mother of Budha; in Buddhist lore she is the consort of Avalokiteshvara and “mother” to the Shakyamuni as a buddha.</p>
<p>The story of the Shakyamuni’s “birth” as a buddha continues the story of Vessantara’s perfection in giving. When Vessantara died, he entered the Heaven of the Delighted (Tushita) from which he descended as the Shakya prince of the Gautama lineage. He later became a muni, and after six years of extreme tapas, sat under an asvattha tree facing east, resolved to transcend the cosmic asvattha tree of samsara. As twilight approached, Death and Desire in the single form of Mara attacked him. Being completely on his own, his only defense was the ripened fruit of perfect acts from previous lives, the greatest of which was his dana as Vessantara. The muni therefore reached down toward Goddess Earth with his right hand and asked her to bear witness to the perfection of his previous giving. Goddess Earth roared in affirmation. As he concentrated on his dana as Vessantara, a huge elephant named Mountaingirdle knelt before him to acknowledge that he had given “the great gift, the supreme gift.” With that, Death-and-Desire fled. The muni then began the series of four visualizations (<em>dhyana</em>) that led at sunrise to his enlightenment as a buddha (<em>Vessantara Jataka</em> 1977: xvii–xix; Robinson and Johnson 1982: 5–13).</p>
<p>The Vessantara story, we are told, was and continues to be the most famous story in the Buddhist world (<em>Vessantara Jataka</em> 1977: xv; Spiro 1970:108). Beginning at Barhut in perhaps the second century BCE, it was depicted in most Buddhist sites from Central Asia to Sri Lanka, and no doubt also at Kanchipuram on structures no longer standing. Its oldest and longest literary version dates from before the third to fourth centuries CE, and resembles a folk epic with similarities to the <em>Mahabharata</em> (<em>Vessantara Jataka</em> 1977: xxvii–xliv). It forms part of the <em>Jataka</em> book and the longest chapter of the <em>Chariya-pitaka</em>, both in the Pali Canon. Its Pali tellings led to tellings in Sanskrit, Chinese, and languages of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>The Pali version, however, may have developed from pre-Buddhist tales about the self-giving Shibi dynasty, which non-Buddhist traditions continued. Taravaloka in the “Great Romance” represents such a non-Buddhist telling; and its related stories of Moon, Tara, and Budha suggest that the pre-Buddhist original was astral (<em>Vessantara Jataka</em> 1977: xxiii–xxxi).</p>
<p>A significant detail in the Vessantara story, however, links it more firmly to this panel’s location next to the window through which the Unobstructed formation gazes southward. If the vimana’s mandala were the mandala of a city, that south-facing window would correspond to its southern gateway. The avadhuta in this panel would then stand at that southern gateway reaching out in a gesture of giving. That gesture alludes to Vessantara who, like Taravaloka, visited the city’s almshouses each day. They stood at the city’s four gates, at its center, and at the gate of his mother’s palace. A king whose land suffered from drought sent eight Brahmins to the city to ask Prince Vessantara to give them his white elephant, for it would bring them rain. Early in the morning, the Brahmins waited at the almshouse at the southern gate and watched Vessantara give alms at the east gate. When he reached them at the southern gate riding on his white elephant, they stretched out their hands and asked him to give them the elephant. Prince Vessantara would have preferred to give them something of his own self, such as his head, but descended the elephant and gave it and everything connected to it: a gift of seven priceless things plus five hundred families of attendants. The Brahmins walked the elephant through the southern gate to the center of the city and exited through the northern gate (<em>Vessantara Jataka</em> 1977:12–14). Vessantara’s dana at the southern gate was the basis of his subsequent career of perfect giving, as Goddess Earth testified, which led to the Shakyamuni’s “awakening.” The depiction of the avadhuta “who gave” (<em>datta</em>) as Vessantara did, his right hand stretched out in a panel placed analogously at “the southern gate,” would allude in the mind of the eighth-century viewer directly to that crucial ritual act in the most popular of Buddhist stories.</p>
<p>Many Buddhists in eighth-century Kanchipuram, whom Hsuan Tsang had noted a century earlier, probably worshiped Tara and followed sadhanas of Esoteric Buddhism known as the Vajrayana and as the Mantrayana (Nakamura 1987: 313–343).22 The formal similarities between the Vajrayana and the Pancharatra Agama are notable. According to L. M. Joshi, the Vajrayana (Diamond Vehicle) originated in the Swat Valley (Uddiyana) in the north and in Dravidian-speaking regions of the south (Dhanyakataka, Sriparvata, and Potalaka Parvata).23 The bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara was believed to dwell with Tara on Potalaka Parvata, which Shu Hikosaka identified as the mountain Potiyil at the southern tip of Tamilnadu (Hikosaka 1989: 177–202). The Mantrayana was first taught at Dhanayakataka, according to Taranatha (Taranatha 1970: 345).</p>
<p>Esoteric Buddhist literature began appearing in the fourth century and was characterized by the use of Vedic rites such as the homa, the role of Indra’s vajra in Vajrapani, the presence of Shaiva and Vaishnava deities, the celebration of the Shakyamuni Buddha as conqueror of demons, and the stress on mantras, especially on the recitation of protective spells (<em>dharani</em>) for the sake of worldly well-being. One such system was known as the Taramantra (Taranatha 1970: 346). By the latter half of the seventh century, Esoteric Buddhists had employed Prajnaparamita thought in two texts perhaps composed at Nalanda, the <em>Mahavairochana-sutra</em> and the <em>Sarvatathagata-tattva-samgraha</em> (Diamond Peak Sutra). By 800 the <em>Guhyasamaja-tantra</em> had been added (Nakamura 1987: 321, 333, note 16). Texts about Tara appeared from the eighth century, as did the earliest epigraphical record of her worship, found in Java (Beyer 1978: 3–11; Nakamura 1987: 334–335). The <em>Kalachakra-tantra</em>, composed in the eleventh century, represented Esoteric Buddhism’s final stage and revealed an affinity to Vaishnavism. Its authors expected that an alliance of the Buddhists, Vaishnavas, and Shaivas would defeat the newly arrived Muslims, and were especially conciliatory toward the Vaishnavas (Nakamura 1987: 339).</p>
<p>In sum, by 800, Buddhists in Kanchipuram following the Vajrayana or Mantrayana, and Bhagavatas following the Pancharatra Agama or Mantrasiddhanta Marga shared these elements: the notion of Shakti; the idea of the threefold or fourfold cosmic body; the idea of the cosmic body as active and taking on forms; the idea of the elements of the universe as the cosmic body of the Effulgent One (the Vishakhayupa or Mahavairochana); a central focus on the use of mantras and dharani accompanied by mudras to attain worldly goals (<em>prayoga</em>); the use of four classes of Agama or Tantra (<em>kriya, charya, yoga</em>, and <em>anuttara-yoga</em> or <em>jnana</em>); mandalas used as objects of meditation; unction by sprinkling or pouring water (<em>abhisheka</em>); the fire sacrifice (<em>homa</em>); the goals of attaining success (<em>siddha</em>) and mysterious power (<em>siddhi</em>); and the purification and use of sexual desire for attaining pure consciousness (Nakamura 1987: 314–339; Gupta 1989).</p>
<p>As noted, the panel depicting Dattatreya flanked by Soma and Durvasas puns on “Budha” and “Buddha,” and on “Tara” and “Avaloka.” The puns would have been evident both to Bhagavatas and to Esoteric Buddhists because of what they shared, especially a similar concept of Shakti: Tara for Esoteric Buddhists resembles Sri Lakshmi for Bhagavatas.24 Dattatreya teaching Yadu also puns on “datta” as “I have given” to denote the bodhisattva Vessantara, the bodhisattva Avalokitesvara, Taravaloka, and Dattatreya; and it connects all those allusions to Krishna, because the panel illustrates the beginning of his “Summary of the <em>Brahman</em> Doctrine.” “Twilight” punning brings all modes of dana back to Krishna.</p>
<p>A contemporaneous literary example of that type of multilayered visual pun appears in a Sanskrit romance of about the mid-seventh century noted for its puns. Appropriately, it is about twilight (<em>samdhya</em>). In his <em>Vasavadatta</em>, Subandhu played on words to describe twilight: “The Lady Twilight was seen, devoted to the stars and clad in red sky, as a Buddhist nun [is devoted to Tara and is clad in red garments].”25 As Stephan Beyer explained, the pun centers on the ambivalence of <em>tara</em> (which means “star” and “Tara”) and of <em>ambara</em> (which means “sky” or “garment”). Beyer, while noting problems in his interpretation, described a situation that fits eighth-century Kanchipuram: “If we do accept that Subandhu was making a pun on the name of a Buddhist goddess before what was a primarily Hindu audience in his courtly circle—and playing with the name as casually as he played with those of the Brahmanic legends—it seems reasonable to suppose that this goddess was fairly well known by his time, else the pun would be without effect. And even if we concede that he might have been showing off an esoteric knowledge of Buddhism, at least he himself was acquainted with some sort of cult of Tara, a goddess whose popular devotion extended beyond the bounds of minor legend.”26 If we replace Subandhu with the designers of the Emperor’s Vishnu-house, we have an accurate statement of what they achieved in these first three south-facing panels: By playing on the names Tara and Datta they evoked Krishna for Bhagavata literati.</p>
<p>THE PANEL. The wandering Dattatreya has two arms and stands at the eastern side of the panel as he looks down at Yadu (Panel 15.4). He is nude except for a loincloth (<em>kaupina</em>) pulled between his legs. His visible left earlobe is lengthened, and his hair is shaved or closely cropped. A halo-like structure surrounds his head, perhaps a nimbus or part of a damaged form above him. His left hand, at the level of his chest, holds a long staff stretching diagonally from his right thigh over his left shoulder. He stretches his right arm downward toward Yadu, and forms a badly damaged mudra with his hand; this mudra, the visual center of the panel, is most likely the danamudra of giving. All an avadhuta has to give is his teaching. But it may also identify this teacher as Datta, “He Who Is Given.”</p>
<p>FIGURE 15.4. Panel S3: The Avadhuta Dattatreya teaches King Yadu (prior to repair). IFDI.</p>
<p>To Dattatreya’s left stands the smaller damaged figure of King Yadu with two arms. He is dressed in royal garb and his crown reaches to the level of Dattatreya’s chin. The king bends his left knee slightly toward the avadhuta, holds his right hand at the level of his stomach, and gazes upward toward him as he gestures praise with his open left hand.</p>
<p>At the top of the panel two male figures form a triangle with the vertical axis as its tip; they appear to gloss Dattareya’s reception of Yadu’s praise and King Yadu’s reception of Dattatreya’s teaching. The crowned male rising from behind the curving form above Dattatreya’s head faces forward, bends from the waist slightly westward, and gestures with his open right hand in an echo of Yadu’s left hand. The figure rising behind Yadu faces forward, tilts his crowned head eastward so that its top touches the other male’s right elbow, and with his right hand at his chest forms what may be the tattvamudra or jnanamudra, in which the thumb and forefinger touch.</p>
<p>THE PANEL’S MEANINGS. The avadhuta Dattatreya represents the perfected yogin, whose walking staff, Krishna tells Uddhava, symbolizes control over mind, speech, and body. Dattatreya’s stately and tranquil nude body illustrates illustrates his perpetually cool state while in the midst of burning sensual desire. Moreover, by illustrating the avadhuta this panel signifies the differing types of Bhagavatas introduced by Brahma and Shiva, and by Uddhava in the <em>Bhagavata Purana</em> (as mentioned in the previous Panel S2), and by Krishna in <em>Bhagavad-gita</em> 12.1–12. In each case the renouncer of the householder life, who seeks the nondual and unmanifest <em>brahman</em>, is set apart from those who seek <em>brahman</em> manifest as Vasudeva Krishna. The avadhuta Dattatreya in this panel represents the first type, those who gather around the imperishable, indefinite Unmanifest, which is present everywhere.</p>
<p>Even though in Bhagavata thought shramanas in Kanchipuram were deceived asuras or “imposters,” that judgment was not as derogatory as it may appear. The next panel portrays Prahlada worshiping Man-lion; Prahlada is the paradigm of the asura as devotee. He represents all people unclean by virtue of birth, ignorance, or sin, who nevertheless receive purification through diksha. To categorize shramanas as asuras, therefore, places them among the majority of the people of the Pallava domain; they all needed to be “cleaned up” through diksha.</p>
<h3 id="panel-s4-prahlada-worships-man-lion-in-the-region-of-hari"><em><strong>Panel S4: Prahlada Worships Man-lion in the Region of Hari</strong></em></h3>
<p>The west half of the vimana’s south-facing side focuses on prayoga rites in its three panels. Just as the three panels of the east half denote the <em>Padma-samhita</em> Brahma learned, so these three panels denote the <em>Ahirbudhnya-samhita</em> Shiva learned. A discussion of prayoga near the end of the <em>Padma-samhita</em> introduces Vighnaraja (King of Obstacles), usually depicted as the elephant-headed son of Parvati and Shiva known as Vighnesha (Ruler of Obstacles), Ganesha (Ruler of Hosts), and Ganapati (Master of Hosts). Vighnaraja does not appear on the vimana, but if he did he would be in this western half of the south-facing wall, as he is in the early sixth-century Bhagavata temple at Deogarh (Hudson 1991). That same chapter in the <em>Padma-samhita</em>, however, gives considerable attention to mantras addressed to various forms of Sudarshana’s representation as a wheel; and the next and penultimate chapter is entirely devoted to prayoga application of the <em>Sudarshana-mantra</em> (<em>PS</em> 31–32; Smith 1975: 241). Sudarshana, it appears, is the “King of Obstacles” (Vighnaraja).</p>
<p>SUDARSHANA. Our fullest understanding of Sudarshana comes from the <em>Ahirbudhnya-samhita</em> (Smith 1975: 43–65). Durvasas overheard Shiva teach Narada about Sudarshana (Beautiful or Handsome) in the form of the Bhagavan’s wheel (<em>chakra</em>). Narada had asked Shiva about the nature of Sudarshana’s power, thinking especially of the way he had defeated other weapons in Vishnu’s battle with Kalanemi (represented on the middle floor above by Panel 20). Shiva explained to Narada what he had learned from Samkarshana, and Durvasas listened. Durvasas then repeated Shiva’s account to Bharadvaja on the banks of the heavenly Ganga River. A condensed form of Durvasas’s account is the <em>Ahirbudhyna-samhita</em>. Besides explaining these final three south-facing panels, it refers to the <em>Satvata-samhita</em> in the context of “pure creation” (<em>AS</em> 5; Smith 1975: 146) and to the <em>Jayakhya-samhita</em> during the discussion of mantras (<em>AS</em> 14.41–66; Smith 1975: 152).</p>
<p>According to Durvasas, Sudarshana embodies Shakti’s will (<em>iccha</em>) to emanate and the efficient cause (<em>kriya</em>) of the universe. Shakti is also its material cause (<em>bhuti</em>). Shakti as Goddess Sri Lakshmi is kriya-shakti, which the Sudarshana wheel in the Bhagavan’s back right hand signifies. Shakti as Goddess Bhumi (Earth) is bhuti-shakti, and though it is not stated explicitly, the conch held in the Bhagavan’s back left hand signifies her, because it and Goddess Earth were lifted out of the water, and because the conch touches the Bhagavan’s lips, as does a female lover.27 In esoteric rites discussed at the Mohini panel above (Panel S6), the conch also becomes the residence of “Kalika of the South” (Dakshinakalika).</p>
<p>As kriya-shakti, Sudarshana causes the emanation and devolution of space-time, and as its “support” (<em>adhara</em>) sustains everything (<em>AS</em> 7.62–73; 8–10; Smith 1975:47–48). Its supporting function (<em>adhara</em>) appears as different forms of the wheel, but also in mandala visualizations as Tortoise (Kurma) and the Snake Shesha or Ananta (<em>PS</em> 22.1–36; Smith 1975: 283–284). Tortoise as “Unbounded” (Akupara) faces west around the corner from Mohini (Panel W1).</p>
<p>One mode of support is teaching about Shakti at work in the world, and such a teaching existed in the Krita Yuga. As the Krita Yuga shifted to the other ages, however, Sudarshana dispersed that original teaching into five systems (<em>shastra</em>) through five sages. Apantaratamas taught the three Vedas, Kapila taught samkhya, Hiranyagarbha (Brahma) taught yoga, Shiva taught the Pashupata, and the Bhagavan as Sudarshana condensed the pure essence of the original and taught it as the Pancharatra or Satvata system (<em>AS</em> 11–13; Smith 1975: 48–50). Sudarshana also promulgated systems intended to delude the wicked through the Buddha, the Jina, and some Shaiva teachers, as illustrated by Panel SP1 and on the middle floor above by Panel 17 (<em>AS</em> 12.51–55; 33.1–23; Smith 1975: 49, 56).28</p>
<p>As Shiva had said, the wheel in various forms embodies Sudarshana, who acts through mantras and yantras. When skilled Brahmins apply mantras in concert with a skilled king’s use of weapons, the kingdom prospers (<em>AS</em> 16; Smith 1975: 51). Mantras infused into the body of the sadhaka protect in two ways: through “a kind of awesome and glowing radiance” (<em>tejas</em>) within the sadhaka’s own being, and through “verbal and spellbinding power” (<em>shakti</em>) employed through eight types of wheel-shaped yantras (<em>AS</em> 21–23; Smith 1975: 52–53).</p>
<p>According to Durvasas, the most powerful mode of protection in the Kali Yuga is the Sudarshana yantra combined with the Narasimha yantra, a pair signified by the adjacent Man-lion and Boar panels facing south (Panels S4 and S5). The sadhanas of those combined yantras can bring about almost anything, and kings find them especially useful (<em>AS</em> 25, 27; Smith 1975: 53–54). To conquer a country, for example, the king should place the Sudarshana icon facing the intended country as he conducts appropriate rites. The weapons and army the king will then use against that country become extensions of various parts of Sudarshana’s body to protect the kingdom and its subjects (<em>AS</em> 29–30; Smith 1975: 54–55).</p>
<p>At the same time, the king is a refugee (<em>prapanna</em>) and at all times should worship the sixteen-armed Sudarshana according to the discipline of nyasa or “abandoning” dharmas, as Krishna urged Arjuna to do in <em>Bhagavad-gita</em> 18.66. That act of refuge (<em>prapatti</em>) has six qualities (in H. Daniel Smith’s summary): “an intense hope that <em>prapatti</em> will be successful, an abandonment of undesirable practices, a deep conviction that God will indeed save one, a sincere petition to Him as Protector, a surrender of oneself, and an admission of one’s helplessness. Who does this <em>‘nyasa’</em> completely and successfully need not do the other things like going on pilgrimages, undertaking <em>vratas</em>, presenting dana-gifts, etc.” (<em>AS</em> 37; Smith 1975: 57). Still, the king may worship Sudarshana for personal health: He eradicates illnesses such as fevers, tuberculosis, skin diseases, gastrointestinal troubles, and epilepsy, because they are fruits of sin and Sudarsana worship removes the sins (<em>AS</em> 38; Smith 1975: 57). But one rite will bring a king the fruits of all rites, Durvasas reported, a “most secret of secrets,” the “Great Unction” (<em>mahabhiseka</em>). The king performs it with the Sudarshana yantra placed on a Mahendra yantra together with a pot of holy water; eventually the water is poured over his head and the heads of his ministers (<em>AS</em> 39; Smith 1975: 58).</p>
<p>According to Durvasas, Shiva said that Sudarshana conquers through at least 102 weapons (<em>astra</em>) connected with mantras, as manifested in the slaughter of Madhu and Kaitabha, which is illustrated directly above this panel on the middle floor (Panel 19). Vishnu appeared in the form of the Sudarshana wheel, decapitated the asura pair, and restored Veda to Brahma (<em>AS</em> 40–41; Smith 1975: 58). Subsidiary mantras (<em>angamantra</em>) use subsidiary weapons (<em>angastra</em>); to illustrate them, Shiva told the story of the king of Kashi who hurled an “effigy” at Krishna. Along with the “effigy,” Sudarshana destroyed the king with his own angastra.</p>
<p>An expanded telling of that story in the <em>Bhagavata Purana</em> illustrates the way a Bhagavata king may defend himself against enemy kings, both Bhagavata and Shaiva (<em>BP</em> 10.66). In the story, Paundraka the king of Karusha claimed to be the real Vasudeva; he represents enemy kings who are also Bhagavatas. While staying with Kashi’s king, Paundraka sent a messenger to Dvaraka to challenge Krishna either to take refuge in him or to fight. Krishna belittled the message, mounted his chariot, and went to Kashi. Paundraka, dressed just like the Bhagavan, went with the king of Kashi and many warriors to attack Krishna outside the city. But Krishna slaughtered the warriors and filled the battlefield with dismembered bodies until it looked like a playground for Rudra, Master of Ghosts (<em>bhutapati</em>). He then cut off Paundraka’s head with the wheel and the head of the Kashi king with arrows, hurled the latter into the city, and returned to Dvaraka. But Paundraka had visualized the Bhagavan each day and wore his emblems, therefore his death by the Sudarshana wheel freed him of bondage and he attained the Bhagavan’s own form (<em>svarupa</em>).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Kashi the beheaded king’s son, Sudakshina (Excellent Right Hand or Virtuous South) vowed revenge. Shiva gave him a boon, and he chose learning the means to slay his father’s slayer. Shiva said to him (in Tapasyananda’s translation): “With the help of Brahmana priests, and adopting the Abhichara rites of worship (black magic) propitiate Dakshinagni [southern fire], who will carry out your objects, as a sacrificial priest does those of the master of a sacrifice. If the ritual is done against anyone other than holy men, your object will be carried out by the Agni along with the Bhutas accompanying him” (<em>BP</em> 10.66.30–31; Tapasyananda 1980–1982 3: 328).</p>
<p>Sudakshina performed the malevolent abhichara rites and out of the southern fire arose Agni in a fierce form: “The hairs on his head and face were like red-hot copper; his eyes emitted sparks of fire; his face with the ends of the fangs protruding and brows fiercely arching, presented a gruesome appearance. With his tongue he licked his lips. Stark naked and armed with a three-pronged trident, he walked about with his palmyrah-like legs, causing tremors on the earth. He ran towards Dwaraka, scorching the environs wherever he went” (<em>BP</em> 10.66.32–34; Tapasyananda 1980–1982 3: 328–329). Dvaraka’s residents saw that embodiment of the abhichara fire rushing toward them and appealed to Krishna for protection. He sent Sudarshana in pursuit. Retreating in shame, the abhichara fire returned to Kashi and burned up Sudakshina and his priests. Sudarshana then entered Kashi, burned it down, and returned to Dvaraka and to Krishna, for whom all exploits are easy.</p>
<p>The story tells us that a king’s enemy may be a Bhagavata, but that does not mean he should not be slain; but just because he is “false” does not mean than once slain he will not attain the Bhagavan. Daily visualization of the Bhagavan purifies him of the sins resulting from his “falseness.” Moreover, even though Shiva is the master of abhichara rites, that does not mean he is not the Bhagavan’s devotee, nor does it mean that abhichara rites do not have their place. They may be used against people who are not “holy” (<em>abrahmanye</em>); but if used against the “holy” they will backfire to destroy their patron and his priests.</p>
<p>Shiva now told Narada about the time the Bhagavan revealed Sudarshana to him so that he could destroy legions of demons threatening the world. Shiva was so strengthened by Sudarshana that other devas went to him for help. He taught Brihaspati, the devas’ acharya, the mantra to summon Sudarshana in his cosmic two-armed form, but it was so overwhelming that Brihaspati fainted (<em>AS</em> 42–43; Smith 1975: 59). Shiva also told Narada about King Kushadhvaja. He was freed of the demon “Great Delusion” (<em>mahamoha</em>) and of all his karma by building Sudarshana a temple and worshiping him for ten days. Removal of karma was the precondition for Kushadhvaja attaining “the sublime wisdom that comes of union with the Divine Soul” (<em>AS</em> 45; Smith 1975: 60). But a king may find it difficult to spend so much time in rites addressed to Sudarshana or to perform rites for which he is not qualified, such as the homa. If so, his court priest (<em>purohita</em>) may perform them on his behalf (<em>AS</em> 46; Smith 1975: 60).</p>
<p>Many Sudarshana rites require much time and effort. Shiva told Narada about the “Great Pacification” (<em>mahashantividhana</em>). Eight emperors performed it to set at rest all the “threatening and malefic powers in this world and the next,” and to gain prestige and power for themselves (<em>AS</em> 47: Smith 1975: 60–61). But there are less time-consuming ways for a king to gain Sudarshana’s power on his behalf. For example, the Sudarshana yantra may be inscribed on a seat, ring, mirror, flag or canopy, and Sudarshana will use that yantra to defend and conquer with his astras (<em>AS</em> 48–50; Smith 1975: 61–62).</p>
<p>Shiva concluded by teaching Narada about the esoteric structure of mantras. Mantras, like humans, have gross (<em>sthula</em>), subtle (<em>sukshma</em>), and transcendent (<em>para</em>) dimensions. Moreover, each letter of the pranava (A-U-M), which begins each mantra, is presided over by Samkarshana, Pradyumna, and Aniruddha, respectively; they give that sound its efficacy. The word <em>namah</em> (veneration), which ends each mantra, establishes a relationship between the mantra’s user and the deva addressed by it (<em>AS</em> 51–52; Smith 1975: 62). Shiva went on to discuss various mantras, but gave special attention to the Tara mantra and to the details of the “Narasimha mantra in the anushtubh meter.” He concluded, finally, by explaining the Purushasukta mantra, the Shrisukta mantra, and the Varaha mantra. The Varaha mantra in its gross or subtle forms reflects the brilliance and power of Sudarshana and summarizes all that he said about mantra (<em>AS</em> 59; Smith 1975: 64). Because of Shiva’s teaching to Narada as reported by Durvasas, we now understand that the panel depicting Man-lion (the Narasimha mantra) finds its completion in the panel depicting Boar (the Varaha mantra).</p>
<p>THE STORY. As discussed in Panels 8 and 9 of the sanctum above, after Narasimha rips apart Hiranyakashipu he ascends Indra’s throne, which the asura had seized, and the asura’s son Prahlada worships him. This takes place in the first Manu Term of this Daytime of Boar. Narasimha makes Prahlada the king of asuras for this single Manu Term. During his rule he practices the life of the refugee, listens to the stories of the Bhagavan, keeps Him in mind, and dedicates all his actions to Him. In order to eradicate karmic fruits, he experiences those already destined for this life, and avoids generating negative ones by performing only good acts. He lets Time consume the fruits that have determined his body’s nature and span of life (<em>BP</em> 7.10.11–14). Once Prahlada completes his rule, it appears, he goes to the Hari region of Jambu to worship Narasimha, for this is where he is during this seventh Manu Term.</p>
<p>The region of Jambu called Hari (Harivarsha) lies immediately south of central Ilavrita (<em>BP</em> 5.18.7–14). The Bhagavan appears here as a tawny lion (<em>hari</em>) in the shape of a man (<em>naraharirupa</em>). The great asura Prahlada worships him together with the region’s other inhabitants, and offers him a prayer beginning with the twelve-syllable Narasimha mantra, <em>Om namo bhagavate narasimhaya</em>. His prayer summarizes the ideal of Krishna’s servant or slave. Prahlada prays to Narasimha for “nonclinging” (<em>asanga</em>) and uses a mantra ending in the “seed” (<em>bija</em>) <em>AUM kshraum</em> (<em>BP</em> 5.18.8). He asks that the Bhagavan as Man-lion, the brilliant and self-sufficient conquering power within tejas, appear with diamond claws and diamond fangs to burn up karma and ignorance. He then prays for the happiness and peace of people, and for the spontaneous flow of their minds toward the Bhagavan: “May all be free from desire, from all karma and delusion, and from all attachments to house, wife, sons, wealth, and relatives. If any attachment is to continue, let it be to the devotees of the Bhagavan who listen to his exploits with a devotion not motivated by personal gain. Clinging to sants (<em>satsang</em>) leads one to hear about the Bhagavan, who then enters consciousness and purifies it. The household is the root of birth and death and Man-lion’s feet are the refuge from it” (<em>BP</em> 5.18.7–14). That portrayal of the Hari region points to the Man-lion Consecration, which purifies one for further consecrations, such as to the powerful “Man-lion mantra in the anushtubh meter.”</p>
<p>THE CEREMONY OF THE MAN-LION CONSECRATION. Prahlada’s asura nature vividly expresses the power of the Man-lion Consecration (<em>nrisimha-diksha</em>), which purifies a male or female of any caste from sin and pollution (<em>asubha</em>), and qualifies those purified for subsequent dikshas (<em>SS</em> 16–17; 19; Smith 1975: 529–530). At its beginning, the acharya constructs a wheel with letters (<em>varnacakra</em>) to worship the four formations (<em>vyuha</em>) (<em>SS</em> 2–5; Smith 1975: 516–518). From that wheel he then constructs a twelve-syllable mantra for the sadhaka to use in private worship (<em>svarthapuja</em>) of Narasimha. Then through yoga the acharya “becomes” Man-lion and projects Man-lion into the wheel design for worship; perhaps the “Man-lion mantra in the anushtubh meter” embodies him. After the acharya worships Man-lion in the wheel, he purifies the sadhaka by placing his hands on his head while speaking mantras. The sadhaka is then blindfolded and offers water in hospitality (<em>arghya</em>) to the material form of the mantra (<em>mantramurti</em>). When the blindfold is removed, the sadhaka “sees” that mantra’s material form, which means, presumably, he sees an item into which the acharya had projected the mantra. The acharya completes the ceremony by worshiping Man-lion again.</p>
<p>The sadhaka afterward uses the nrisimha mantra constructed for him in a sadhana that may last as long as twenty-one days, and may extend for another seven with japa and homa so that the sadhaka may get “anything his heart desires” (<em>SS</em> 17.453–454; Smith 1975: 527). Once he or she is purified, the sadhaka may choose to receive other dikshas for other sadhanas, but in any case must worship Man-lion daily.</p>
<p>Prahlada’s perpetual prayer in the Hari region reveals the Narasimha mantra’s ideal use. It may indeed lead the sadhaka toward all worldly benefits, but the ideal sadhaka will use it to destroy the desire for such benefits. The ideal sadhaka will pray that he or she, and all others too, may be freed from attachment to the household and all it represents even while living in their midst. The ideal sadhaka will ask for only one thing: that the Bhagavan will stimulate in him or her, and in all others too, the desire to cling to sants. Prahlada makes the reason explicit: Clinging to sants (<em>satsanga</em>) will open the ears to the Krishna story because sants always talk about it. Hearing those stories will purify consciousness; as consciousness is purified, the single-minded desire for the Bhagavan innate to the soul (<em>jiva</em>) will gradually flame up; as it flames, single-minded desire feeds on the fuel of all other desires and eliminates them.</p>
<p>PRAHLADA AND THE “MAN-LION MANTRA IN THE ANUSHTUBH METER.” Prahlada was the paradigmatic refugee (<em>prapanna</em>).29 He stood among devas and others too terrified to approach the enthroned Bhagavan, including even Goddess Sri Lakshmi. That was at the beginning of the first manvantara of the present kalpa, six manvantaras before our own, when Boar also appeared (<em>BP</em> 7.9.1–10.34).30 Prahlada’s exclusive devotion to the Bhagavan was instrumental in his father’s death and now he was heir to the asura throne. He had a special claim to Man-lion’s attention, and so after Man-lion had slain Hiranyakashipu (as illustrated on the middle floor above by Panels 8 and 9), devas led by Brahma asked Prahlada to intercede with the frightening Man-lion on their behalf, and pacify him. Prahlada agreed, and his lengthy prayer to Man-lion appears to comment on the “Man-lion mantra in the anushtubh meter” (<em>nrsimhanushtubh mantra</em>).31</p>
<p>Slowly Prahlada approached the enthroned Man-lion, joined his palms in the anjalimudra, and prostrated full length on the ground in front of his feet. He had placed himself in the category of refugee, and by making himself totally helpless before the warrior king’s conquering wrath, his anjalimudra pacified him. Man-lion felt compassion (<em>kripa</em>) well up within him from his innate dharma of generous and self-giving disposition toward any sincere refugee, no matter what gender, family, caste, or nature. He acted on that feeling of compassion and reached down, lifted Prahlada up, and placed the palms of his hands on his head. Instantly, Prahlada’s pollution (<em>ashubha</em>) dissolved and he had the vision (<em>darshana</em>) of the unmanifest supreme atman. In ritual terms, Man-lion’s touch was the “Vishnu hand” (<em>vishnuhasta</em>), the acharya’s purifying touch of the sadhaka’s head accompanied by mantras.32</p>
<p>Prahlada bowed to Man-lion and spoke at length in praise and adoration. He then made his requests, none of which had to do with his own personal worldly gain. He first asked Man-lion to remove his anger so as not to frighten devas. Second, he appealed to Man-lion to teach him “the discipline of serving you,” the only means by which he may transcend the destructive power of Time. It is not the protecting Man-lion who frightens him, Prahlada admitted, but the samsara wheel propelled by maya to operate karma. Prahlada’s third request, therefore, was that Man-lion as protector draw him away from Man-lion as the samsara wheel. His fourth request was that he be led while alive to the company of the Bhagavan’s devotees to serve them. Prahlada paused to reveal his newly granted understanding by explaining the Bhagavan’s threefold form, with its subtle and gross bodies encompassed by his highest mode as One. For the sake of the gross body, he said, the Bhagavan overcame rajas and tamas through sattva by entering as his beloved Hayagriva, by destroying Madhu and Kaitabha, and by restoring Veda to Brahma.33</p>
<p>Then Prahlada requested emancipation from samsara for himself along with all others helplessly caught in it. Prahlada ended by repeating the helpless condition of those caught by the passions, especially by sexual passion, which can be controlled only through grace. Prahlada finished his prayer and stood before Man-lion, who now gave him a boon, any worldly blessing he desired. Prahlada asked that no desires should arise within him, for he only wanted to serve the Bhagavan completely without self-interest, just as the Bhagavan gives boons without self-interest (<em>BP</em> 7.10.2–10).34 Man-lion nevertheless made Prahlada the leader of asuras for one manvantara, enjoying all its status and power. While in that position, he was to practice the life of the refugee, listen to the stories of the Bhagavan, keep the Bhagavan in mind, and dedicate all his actions to him. In order to eradicate karmic fruits, he was to experience those already destined for this life and avoid generating new negative ones by performing only good acts, letting Time consume those that have determined his body’s nature and lifespan (<em>BP</em> 7.10.11–14).</p>
<p>Prahlada finally asked that his father, Hiranyakashipu, be purified of his grievous sins. Surprisingly, Man-lion said that because of Prahlada’s birth, Hiranyakashipu and twenty-one generations of his ancestors had already been purified. Even so, as the model for all refugees to imitate, Prahlada should now perform the cremation rites as taught in Veda. Prahlada did so. Priests then consecrated him king of asuras. Devas, who saw that Man-lion was pacified, now approached him freely (<em>BP</em> 7.10.24–34).</p>
<p>Shiva told Parvati that the Nrisimhanushtubh mantra is so powerful that Brahma used it to create the world, that it is the basis of human and deva powers, and that unlike other mantras it may be used freely at any time without the usual ritual restrictions (<em>Ishvara-samhita</em> 1.19–27; Smith 1975: 88). Even Markandeya overcame death by means of that mantra with thirty-two syllables divided into eleven parts to describe Man-lion’s physical and spiritual features (<em>Ishvara-samhita</em> 2.1–18; Smith 1975: 88).</p>
<p>The diksha of this mantra is relatively simple compared to others. In the night before consecration, the sadhaka and acharya fast and worship Man-lion. They honor Shakti in a mandala drawn on the ground to which devas are invoked in pots placed at various spots. The sadhaka bathes and he and the acharya sleep. In the morning after bathing, the acharya selects a priest to chant Vedic mantras. Special offerings are then made to Man-lion and into the fire, and the acharya bathes the sadhaka from special vessels. Now dressed in new clothes, the sadhaka sits next to the acharya, who places his right hand on the candidate’s chest and whispers, “You shall now become my son.” The disciple agrees, repeats mantras, offers the Bhagavan flowers, and the diksha concludes. The acharya clasps his “son’s” right hand and teaches him the Nrisimhanushtubh mantra, which he will use in all devotional acts (<em>Ishvara-samhita</em> 3; Smith 1975: 88–89).</p>
<p>The mantra’s varieties depend on the peaceful or violent uses to which it will be put and on the corresponding mudras and dhyanas. For example, visualization of “a Leonine Form, his tail stretched up, his tongue lapping up all sentient creatures” accompanies the mantra when used to influence and subdue others. Visualization of a Man-lion with five fierce faces accompanies the mantra when used to cure diseases and illnesses from poisons (<em>Ishvara-samhita</em> 4; Smith 1975: 89). The mantra also has its lotus-shaped yantra, which, when used with nyasa, protects from all kinds of evils (<em>Ishvara-samhita</em> 5; Smith 1975: 89–90). Furthermore, use of the mantra with specific types of fire rites can produce, for example, a son for a barren woman, plentiful grain in the household, paralysis of someone else, the admiration of oneself by others, and relief from fever (<em>Ishvara-samhita</em> 7–8; Smith 1975: 90). Special rites addressed to Goddess Lakshmi with Man-lion will elevate one to the status of king (<em>Ishvara-samhita</em> 10; Smith 1975: 91). Shiva concluded by describing visualization of the “wheel at the center of consciousness” (<em>hridaya-chakra</em>) while sitting in various postures (<em>asana</em>) that will yield different results: “For example, if one wants to kill a particular person, one must simply imagine that enemy being beaten by others mercilessly. Homa-oblations, accompanied by specific meditations, and done at such times as the dead of the night or in certain seasons, may also effect such sorceries as subduing others or bringing about their death—or even, simply, beating them in debate” (condensation in Smith 1975: 92).</p>
<p>The Sudarshana chakra mandala as described in the exoteric explication of that “king of mantras” summarizes themes introduced by the southeast corner panel (<em>Nrisimha-purva-tapaniya Upanishad</em> 5; Deussen 1980: 828–833).35 The mandala slays evil spirits and protects from death; after the sadhaka has received it from the acharya, he or she should wear it on the neck, arm, or hairtuft. Its power is equivalent to what the sadhaka would gain if he or she had given earth with its seven continents as the dakshina gift at the end of a sacrifice (<em>Nrisimha-purva-tapaniya Upanisad</em> 5.2; Deussen 1980: 831). But while Prahlada’s prayer implied that exoteric use of the Sudarshana chakra mandala, his request went beyond it to its esoteric use: It is the means to relate to the atman as taught in the <em>Nrisimha-uttara-tapaniya Upanishad</em> (Deussen 1980: 835–858).</p>
<p>THE PANEL. Narasimha stands in the center of the panel facing the viewer (Figure 15.5). His right hip extends slightly to his right as if his weight is on his right foot in a posture of ease. He has two pairs of arms. His badly damaged back pair presumably holds the conch in the left hand and the wheel as a prayogachakra in the right hand. His front pair of hands forms two mudras at the level of his chest. His left hand forms what appears to be the ahutimudra, which refers to Vedic sacrifice: the thumb touches the tips of the second and third fingers (<em>PS</em> 1974: no. 72). His right hand appears to form the tattvamudra or jnanamudra, which refers to teaching: the tips of the thumb and forefinger touch (<em>PS</em> 1974: no. 99). This combination may be interpreted to signify the teaching (right hand) of the mantras of Vedic sacrifice (left hand).</p>
<p>FIGURE 15.5. Panel S4: Prahlada worships Man-lion in the region of Hari. AIIS.</p>
<p>At Narasimha’s right side, slightly in front, kneels Prahlada. His crown reaches Narasimha’s waist. His right knee touches the ground below the level of Narasimha’s feet, and his left foot rests flat. He faces southeast, gazes downward, and with his two hands forms the anjalimudra in devout attentiveness. High above Narasimha’s crown two figures watch, one behind the other. The one in front articulates the panels’ vertical axis, which runs down through Narasimha’s crown, the center of his body, and the space between his feet.</p>
<p>THE PANEL’S MEANINGS. This panel represents the region of Hari on the Jambu continent, directly south of Mount Meru, and denotes the completion of the story of Narasimha and Hiranyakashipu depicted in Panels 8 and 9 on the sanctum above. The story ends in Indra’s palace at Devadhani on the mountain Manasottara on Pushkara, the seventh and outermost of Earth’s continents.</p>
<p>The panel uses Prahlada, an impure asura who is purified, and whose prahlada or delight is in Krishna, to represent the refugee type of Bhagavata. Just as women, Shudras, and others who are inherently impure are purified through Bhagavata consecrations, so is Prahlada, but his prayer is for even greater purity. He invokes Narasimha as the “Tejas of tejas,” the source of the brilliant conquering power burning through his vajra or diamond claws and teeth to destroy impurity, most notably any arrogance produced by the skillful practice of yoga. The location of this episode on Manasottara, “Boundary of the Mind,” suggests that Narasimha’s vajra teeth and claws operate with the sadhaka at the limit of his thinking.</p>
<p>Finally, the panel implies a specific Pancharatra consecration relevant to all impure people no matter what their ritual class or their caste.</p>
<h3 id="panel-s5-goddess-earth-worships-boar-in-the-region-of-uttarakuru"><em><strong>Panel S5: Goddess Earth Worships Boar in the Region of Uttarakuru</strong></em></h3>
<p>THE STORY. This famous story began at the west-facing panel depicting Boar with Brahma (Panel W6).36 Goddess Earth, who had not yet been divided into seven continents and oceans or populated, had somehow sunk down into the nether world of Rasatala (Taste) (<em>BP</em> 3.13.17 and 5.24.7). Asuras known as Panis live in Rasa like snakes, afraid of the Bhagavan’s wheel Sudarshana and of Yama’s curse.37 Yama, of course, evokes the south. To rescue Goddess Earth from Rasa, Sacrifice as Person (Yajnapurusha) emerged from Brahma’s nostril as a tiny boar (<em>varaha</em>) the size of a thumb and immediately swelled into enormous proportions and roared. Applauded by seers dwelling in the Jana, Tapa, and Satya worlds above Dhruva, Boar smelled around to find Goddess Earth, roared again, and plunged into the waters, as an elephant in play (<em>BP</em> 3.13.25–29). When he reached Rasatala, he found her “whom he had formerly sheltered in his abdomen” and lifted her up (<em>BP</em> 3.13.30). But then Hiranyaksha attacked.</p>
<p>The asura Hiranyaksha had been looking for a fight for a long while. He had first gone to the deva world (in the east), but found no one because Indra and the others had already fled. He had then entered the ocean for fun, played around for a thousand years, and frightened all its creatures. Then he had gone to Varuna’s city called Vibhavari (in the west) and challenged Varuna, the protector of asura realms in the nether worlds and of ocean’s creatures.38 Varuna controlled his anger and told Hiranyaksha that if he wanted a good fight, he should find the primordial Person who takes up forms to defeat beings like him (<em>BP</em> 3.17.29–31). So the asura went down to the realm of Rasa to search him out.</p>
<p>When Hiranyaksha saw Boar carrying Goddess Earth, he ridiculed him as a wild animal stealing her who rightly belongs to the residents of Rasa where she had fallen. Patiently, Boar rose out of the waters, placed Goddess Earth on them, and infused her with his supporting power to keep her from sinking again (<em>BP</em> 3.18.6–8). He and Hiranyaksha then began a long and bloody fight with maces (<em>gada</em>). Brahma and the seers arrived on the scene, and Brahma explained that ever since he had received a boon from him, Hiranyaksha had been a source of endless trouble. “Kill him,” he urged Boar, “right now before night comes when asura power increases. Twilight (<em>samdhya</em>) is approaching and the auspicious hour (<em>muhurta</em>) of conquest (<em>abhijit</em>) is about to end” (<em>BP</em> 3.18.21–28).39</p>
<p>With a smile, Boar sprang at Hiranyaksha and struck his jaw but dropped his mace. Keeping to the code of warriors, the asura did not attack the weaponless opponent. Boar then called up his wheel Sudarshana and the asura attacked with mace, trident, and bare hands. He then resorted to magic and conjured pollutions of all sorts, including urine, feces, bones, blood and hair, and naked female rakshasis with spears and loosened hair, and bloodthirsty yakshas and rakshasas. But Sacrifice as Person dispersed them all with his purifying Sudarshana wheel. Hiranyaksha then grabbed Boar, but he broke the grip. Finally, while the asura pounded him with his fists, Boar hit him with his foot at the base of his ear and killed him. Brahma and the seers praised the asura’s good fortune, for he had been killed by the Bhagavan’s foot while looking at his face, a face that yogins desiring freedom from the subtle body based on falseness visualize in solitude through the enstasy of unified consciousness (<em>BP</em> 3.19.17–28).</p>
<p>With Hiranyaksha dead, Brahma and the seers began to praise Boar. He appeared to them holding Goddess Earth on his white tusks against the background of his enormous blue body (<em>BP</em> 3.13.33). They then alluded to Goddess Earth as the lotus womb Vasudeva had inseminated with Brahma’s jiva, and to Boar as the father who placed his seed in her, after which she brought forth all the worlds (<em>BP</em> 3.13.42). Boar then scooped out a place for Goddess Earth, established her in it, and vanished (<em>BP</em> 3.13.46–47).</p>
<p>In the northern Kuru region of Jambu, Goddess Earth and others use Bhakti-yoga to worship Boar as depicted here (<em>BP</em> 5.18.34–39). Bhumidevi recites a prayer that ends with a description of the scene portrayed by the panel: “Just as an elephant kills its rival, Boar destroyed the asura Hiranyaksa; and just as an elephant in play, he lifted her up by his tusk and brought her out of the waters.” Goddess Earth in northern Kuru thus gazes at herself being rescued by Sacrifice as Person. Parikshit identified Goddess Earth’s prayer as a Upanishad that reveals Boar as Sacrifice as Person (<em>BP</em> 5.18.34). Boar is the object of sacrifice, the procedures of the sacrifice, and the fruits of the sacrifice all together in one Person. He is understood only through mantra. His manifest form is composed of sacrifices conducted with and without sacrificial posts, and his limbs are the great sacrifices. His ritual acts (<em>karma</em>) are pure. But he manifests himself in only three ages, which we know from the story of Pururavas, are the Treta, Dvapara, and Kali Yugas, for there is no sacrifice in the Satya Yuga (Tagare 1976–1979 2: 729).</p>
<p>Sacrificial actions and their fruits, however, conceal the Bhagavan’s unmanifest essential shape (<em>svarupa</em>). As the cause of sacrificial efficacy, all sacrifices are latent in his pores (<em>BP</em> 3.13.34). For that reason some call him the Causal Boar (<em>karana-sukara</em>) or Hari the Primeval Boar (<em>Hari-adi-sukara</em>) or Narayana the Primeval Boar (<em>Narayana-adi-sukara</em>) (<em>BP</em> 3.20.31; 3.20.37; 3.19.21). His true shape is perceived only when the body and senses are disciplined and the discriminating mind pierces through maya. Of course, maya creates, sustains, and destroys through her material “threads” (<em>guna</em>) only because of him: Just as a piece of iron moves about when a magnet draws near, so maya acts in the presence of Vasudeva as cause. Like the magnet, he is the uninvolved witness of the activities she performs because of his presence.</p>
<p>The panel, we now see, represents Agama’s mantra system as Veda’s supplement, both represented by Boar as the essential shape (<em>svarupa</em>) of the Sacrifice as Person.40 Goddess Earth’s Upanishad reveals mantra to be his self-expression and our means for understanding him; and mantra is at the center of Agama.41 Its mantrashastra equals Veda’s system in validity and efficacy, but differs in one crucial respect: Pancharatra mantras may be used to worship the vyuhas by any person of any caste once they have been consecrated (<em>SS</em> 2.1–12; Smith 1975: 516). Worship with those mantras (<em>upasana</em>), we now know, is equivalent to performance of Veda’s fire sacrifices. Those qualified to perform Veda’s fire rituals, however, retain them in Agama rites such as the homa (<em>SS</em> 2.4–5; 43–77a, esp. 67; Smith 1975: 516).42 In other words, the Pancharatra Agama “translates” Veda’s rites for the Kali Yuga in the same way the <em>Mahabharata</em> “translates” Veda’s thought, and in principle both make Veda available to everyone. The image of Goddess Earth held by Boar in the late afternoon articulates Agama’s rescue of Bharata as karmabhumi just as Kali Yuga darkness is about to begin.</p>
<p>Sacrifice as Person upholding Goddess Earth manifests himself through mantras employed through upasana in the context of loving devotion.43 The context of the panel, flanked by Man-lion to the east and Mohini to the west, defines upasana here as prayoga: Only those who have first purified themselves through the Man-lion Consecration may receive consecrations into mantras through which they may gain “the whole earth.”</p>
<p>In narrative, the Boar and Man-lion stories connect to each other directly, as the sequence of these two panels suggests, and also connect to the stories of Rama and Krishna. Boar and Man-lion are the first of three pairs of births undertaken by Jaya and Vijaya, doorkeepers in Vaikuntha cursed by Brahma’s four Kumara sons (<em>BP</em> 3.15). Jaya and Vijaya were first born as the asura brothers Hiranyakashipu and Hiranyaksha, then as the rakshasa brothers Ravana and Kumbhakarna, and finally as the humans Shishupala and Dantavaktra. As Man-lion and Boar, the Bhagavan slew the first pair; as Rama and his brothers, he slew the second pair; and as Krishna, he slew the third pair. A sequence of sculpted panels, interrupted only by the southwest corner, link those stories. One east-facing panel refers to Rama (Panel E4), the next one to Krishna (Panel E5), and the two facing south after the corner refer to Krishna’s “Summary” (Panels S2 and S3), followed by the Man-lion and Boar panels (S4 and S5). Jaya and Vijaya appear in the story depicted by the porch’s south-facing corner panel (Panel SP3).</p>
<p>Those narrative and sculpted sequences denote Pancharatra sadhanas. Hanuman’s prayer to Rama in the first panel signifies desire for freedom from ordinary householder life. That leads to desire for consecration articulated by Goddess Sri Lakshmi in the second panel. Krishna in the third and fourth panels distinguishes between the radical renouncer and the householder as “holy person” and reveals the options for those who seek consecration. Then in the Man-lion panel, Prahlada signifies the purification to prepare the sadhaka for diksha, and the Boar panel signifies the diksha’s completion with the unction.</p>
<p>In sum, Boar holding Earth in a panel facing south depicts kriyashakti (Boar) transformimg bhutishakti (Goddess Earth) into a prosperous and protected world. Specifically, it signifies Shakti’s ability to rescue, establish, fertilize, and preserve a kingdom through rites and armies sponsored by a Bhagavata king. The “Boar mantra” (<em>Varaha mantra</em>) expresses Sudarshana, who in turn expresses Shakti’s iccha and kriya; they emerge when she “opens her eyes” as discussed in the <em>Ahirbudhnya-samhita</em>. Boar is Sacrifice as Person appearing as the ruler’s rites to enable Sudarshana to permeate his army and weapons in the conquest of enemies (<em>AS</em> 30; Smith 1975: 54–55). The depiction also points to the highly secret sadhana of the “Great Unction” (<em>mahabhiseka</em>), during which the king worships through a Sudarshana yantra in a Mahendra mandala with a pot of water, which is poured over his head and the heads of his ministers (<em>AS</em> 39: Smith 1975: 58). Boar holds Goddess Earth while facing south because during prayoga, the Unobstructed formation’s potency (<em>shakti</em>) releases brilliant and self-sufficient conquering power (<em>tejas</em>) to protect, expand, and fertilize the realm.</p>
<p>THE PANEL. This badly damaged panel depicts Boar as a crowned male with two pairs of arms and a boar’s head (Figure 15.6). He stands on its western side, faces east, and turns slightly sideways toward the viewer. The image captures Boar springing up from Patala: he pushes off a ledge with his right foot and raises his left knee for the upward spring. Boar holds Goddess Earth with his front pair of hands; his right hand grasps her knees and his left hand reaches behind to grasp her left shoulder. His back pair of hands is badly damaged, but the conch in his left hand is visible and there are remains of the wheel positioned as a prayogachakra.</p>
<p>FIGURE 15.6. Panel S5: Goddess Earth worships Boar in the region of Uttarakuru (prior to repair). IFDI.</p>
<p>Goddess Earth is depicted as human female with one pair of arms sitting astride Boar’s uplifted left thigh, but her entire right shoulder and arm are no longer visible. Her left arm bends up at the elbow, and her left hand may form a mudra at her chest. Her head and face are broken off, but she appears to gaze up at Boar’s face while he gazes at her.</p>
<p>The Panis’ realm appears in the panel at the bottom, where the crowned and multihooded naga under Goddess Earth forms the anjalimudra. His damaged hoods are visible behind the right side of his head. The upper body of a small female companion clings to his right side and looks upward toward Boar. The lower portions of both are missing. Above Boar and Goddess Earth are two males sitting, each with one pair of arms. The male above Boar appears to be springing up from his seat as if echoing Boar’s active posture: his right leg bends forward at the knee and his left leg stretches back. He holds his right hand at his right breast, perhaps forming a mudra, and may raise his damaged left arm and hand in a gesture of praise. The other male figure, directly above Earth’s head, repeats her passive posture and sits firmly, body erect as he bends his head downward to look at Boar. His damaged right hand at his chest may also form a mudra.</p>
<p>The panel depicts the vision Brahma and the seers received after Hiranyaksha’s conquest during the abhijinmuhurta, but as replicated in the Northern Kuru region. Sacrifice as Person has picked up Goddess Earth from the surface of the water to establish her firmly in place so that Brahma’s creation may continue. As he holds her, Brahma and seers in the highest realms praise them as Father and Mother. All three realms of spacetime thus appear in the panel: Figures at the top stand in the highest realm above Dhruva; the multihooded snake stands in the Pani’s lowest realm at the bottom; and the tall Boar, who links the lowest to the highest, holds Goddess Earth in the middle where she belongs.</p>
<p>THE PANEL’S MEANINGS. According to the story, Boar slays Hiranyakashipu in the afternoon before sunset, which is where this panel stands.</p>
<p>The panel represents the Uttarakuru region of Jambu and depicts a portrayal of Boar rescuing Goddess Earth that was worshiped in sacred places throughout Bharata at the time this temple was built. The panel does not depict any Kurus worshiping, and unless Goddess Earth is to be understood as worshiping Boar as he holds her, she is not depicted as worshiping either. We are probably to assume that this familiar image is the icon they worship.</p>
<p>The upanishad that Goddess Earth prays to Boar reveals that knowledge of the mantra rites of Vedic sacrifice embodied by Boar is the key to the knowledge of everything (<em>BP</em> 5.18.35–39). As if to refute the non-Vedic teachings of the Buddhists, Jains, and Ajivikas, this prayer states that all of manifest existence depends on the mantras of Vedic sacrifice.</p>
<p>Finally, this and the previous panel appear to represent two ritual stages in the rule of a Bhagavata king. The previous panel of the Hari Region, where Prahlada worships the icon of Narasimha, represents his diksha consecration to the Man-lion mantras. This panel of the Uttarakuru region, where Goddess Earth worships Boar, represents the shakti of the kriya ceremonies he sponsors to protect his realm.44</p>
