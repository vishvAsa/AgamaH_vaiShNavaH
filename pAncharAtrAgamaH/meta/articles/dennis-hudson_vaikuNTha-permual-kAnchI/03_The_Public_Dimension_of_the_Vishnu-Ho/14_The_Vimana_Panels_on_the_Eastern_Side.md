title = "14 The Vimana Panels on the Eastern Side"

+++





The panels on the eastern side of the vimana illustrate the virya action and the aishvarya sovereignty of Pradyumna, Vasudeva’s second and Pre-eminently Mighty formation. This formation, based on the self-delusion of Samkarshana the Plower, expresses the passion propelling Vasudeva’s emanation of directional space and chronological time through Brahma.

Of matter’s three “threads” \(*guna*\), the east-facing panels illustrate rajas, the passion that accounts for desire \(*kama*\), anger \(*krodha*\), and deed \(*karma*\). When a sense of “I” and “mine” motivates action, it is generative \(*pravritti*\) and moves the actor forward within chronological time. When the sense of “I” and “mine” is removed from action, it is nongenerative \(*nivritti*\) and leads the actor out of chronological time. Nivritti as the solution to pravritti is the subject of the east-facing panels.

The panels continue Brahma’s waking day begun by the north-facing panels. Brahma’s day-and-night is the paradigm for the human day-and-night, which begins at night’s end \(4–6 a.m.\). Daytime begins at sunrise \(6–8 a.m.\), which falls at the vimana’s northeast corner and reaches its midday zenith \(12–2 p.m.\) at its southeast corner.

In the terms of the solar year as a day-and-night, the northeast corner panel denotes the winter solstice, which begins the light half of the year and the Tamil month of Tai \(Pushya\). The following two panels denote the month of Machi \(Magha\). The next two panels denote the last month of the year known as Pankuni \(Phalguna\). The panel at the southeast corner begins the cycle anew with the first month of the year known as Chittirai \(Chitra, Chaitra\). Of Bharata’s four ages \(*yuga*\), this side illustrates the Treta Yuga, symbolized by the number three.

The panels sculpted at the corners of this side are divided into two parts, signaling that this is Vasudeva’s second formation. Of the four panels they bracket, the two north of the central opening illustrate virya and the two south of it illustrate aishvarya. We shall begin with the two corner panels.



## **The Two Corner Panels**

### ***Panel E1: Brahma Worshiped on the. Continent of Pushkara and His Four Kumara Sons***

THE STORY. The seventh continent on the outer edge of Earth is called Pushkara, “Blue Water Lily” or “Blue Lotus Blossom.” Beyond it, on the other side of a huge expanse of pure water, is Lokaloka, illustrated by Panel W2. The Pushkara continent is divided into two regions by the mountain range called Manasottara, “Beyond the Mind.” On this mountain is Indra’s city Devadhani to the east of Mount Meru, Yama’s city Samyamani to the south, Varuna’s city Nimlochani to the west, and Soma’s city Vibhavari to the north \(*BP* 5.21.7\). One wheel of Surya’s chariot runs along the top of this mountain \(*BP* 5.22.13\). Surya measures the year \(*samvatsara* or *vatsara*\) in a cycle divided into the day-and-night of devas and asuras.

Ramanaka and Dhataki, the two sons of Priyavarta’s son Vitihotra, rule these regions where the Blue Lotus Blossom, with thousands of petals shining like flames, serves as the throne of the Bhagavan in the shape of Brahma. This body of Brahma is constructed of karma or ritual action and has only one head and face; he passes this form on to the Manus as the paradigm of the human male who is qualified to perform kriya or ceremony \(*BP* 5.20.29–33\). Brahma uses this single-faced body, its shadow, and its reflection to populate the brahmanda he creates \(BP 3.20.12–53\). In contrast to Brahma’s passionate creativity, his first-born Kumara sons Sanaka, Sanandana, Sanatana, and Sanatkumara are established in knowledge of the atman, are chaste, and are completely devoted to Vasudeva \(BP 3.12.4–7\).

THE PANEL. The panel is divided horizontally into two unequal portions \(Figure 14.1\). The upper two-thirds portray the Bhagavan in the shape of Brahma standing behind the closed blossom of the brilliantly shining Blue Lotus that gives the continent its name. Surya is rising over the horizon and the blossom bends eastward toward him and begins to open. The panel’s vertical axis bifurcates Brahma’s body from the top of his crown down through the middle of the lotus to divide Brahma’s four sons sitting below into two pairs. Brahma is dressed royally, wears a tall crown and faces directly east toward the viewer, but his body from the thighs down is hidden behind his lotus-blossom throne. He has two pairs of arms. His back pair of hands rests on his hips. The forearms and hands of his front pair are missing, but appear to have held the anjalimudra at the center of his chest.




FIGURE 14.1. Panel E1: Brahma worshiped on the continent of Pushkara and his four Kumara sons. AIIS.


Four male figures are arranged vertically on each side of Brahma and the lotus blossom. Two small figures above stand at Brahma’s shoulders facing forward. The figure on the south raises his left arm and bends his open palm in praise toward Brahma’s face. Presumably the badly damaged figure on the north side mirrors this gesture. Two larger figures turned slightly toward Brahma at his torso and legs may be the rulers Ramanaka and Dhataki, although they appear to be flying. The figure on the south points the knee of his bent left leg northward as he stretches his right leg to the south, and stretches his right arm back parallel with it. He raises his left arm, presumably in a gesture of praise with his missing left hand. The figure on the north mirrors this posture. Two much smaller figures below fly at the sides of the lotus with similar gestures of praise.

The bottom third of the panel portrays the four Kumara sons of Brahma. Sanaka, Sanandana, Sanatana, and Sanatkumara sit on the same level, two on each side of the vertical axis running down from the top of Brahma’s crown, each pair slightly turned toward the middle. They sit mirrored with legs crossed, and may be nude or may wear loincloths that are not visible. All four have piled matted hair, long earlobes touching their shoulders, one pair of arms, and damaged hands at the waist. In the order of their birth, Sanaka the elder sits at Brahma’s extreme right \(south\), and to his left sits Sanandana, who raises his open left palm to gesture toward the scene above. Sanatana follows him, and Sanatkumara as the youngest ends the sequence at Brahma’s extreme left \(north\).

THE PANEL’S MEANINGS. This corner panel represents Pushkaradvipa, the Continent of the Blue Lotus Blossom, the outermost of Earth’s seven circular continents. Its mountain range Manasottara, “Beyond the Mind,” identifies this continent as the boundary of Brahma’s mental activity during his Daytime of Boar. It also respresents Surya appearing in the east to begin Brahma’s morning, and morning on Bharata.

The horizontal division between Brahma above and his four Kumara sons below represent Brahma’s creative passion and the Kumaras’ nonclinging consciousness, both focused eastward toward Vasudeva as the Person to whom morning sacrifices are offered. This combination of action impelled by passion and nonclinging consciousness signifies virya, the ability to act without clinging to the action and its consequences, a function of the sovereignty represented at the southeast corner by Panel E6.



### ***Panel E6: Bhava on Kailasa Venerates Pradyumna***

THE STORY. The scene is Mount Kailasa in the central region of our Jambu continent, which is called Ilavrita. At Ilavrita’s center stands Mount Meru, at whose center is Brahma’s square city surrounded in the cardinal and intermediate directions by the eight Lokapala world protectors \(*BP* 5.16.28–29\). It is perpetually midday on Mount Meru \(*BP* 5.21.8\); and the end of morning at midday is the period of time this panel signifies. Mount Meru is surrounded on its four sides by eight mountains, one of which is Kailasa; it stands south of Meru to the east, and southeast is the location of this panel.

Shiva resides on Kailasa with the name Bhava \(Coming into Being\), which suggests his creative use by the Pre-eminently Mighty formation, with his consort there, the Goddess Bhavani. On Kailasa, Shiva teaches seers sitting around him under a banyan tree \(*BP* 4.6.8–38\), and among his teachings is the prayer known as Yogadesha \(*BP* 4.24.32–79\); known also as the Rudra-gita, Brahma had taught it to Bhrigu and others born of himself for procreation \(*BP* 4.24.72–73\). It is to be recited when starting off in the morning \(*BP* 4.24.28\). Shiva also entertains Devi with the vast collection of tales called “The Ocean of the Streams of Story” \(*Kathasaritsagara*\). Nevertheless, on Kailasa Shiva worships the Plower as he appears in Patala, not the Pre-eminently Mighty as depicted here. We shall leave that fact to the end of the discussion. Let us first consider the story of Shiva’s Ilavarta-varsha \(Region that Changes Ila\). Appropriate to Chittirai \(Chitra, Chaitra\), the first month of the lunar-solar year \(*samvatsara*\), Ila’s story tells the origins of the Lunar Dynasty in the west at Hastinapura and the Solar Dynasty in the east at Ayodhya.

Rama tells Lakshmana the story of Ila in the *Ramayana’s* final book to introduce the horse sacrifice \(*Ram* 7.87–90\). There Ila is the son of Kardama, ruler of Bahlika, and the event of the male Ila becoming female takes place during the “charming month of Chaitra.” Thereafter, Ila is male one month and female the next. Eventually, through a horse sacrifice addressed to Shiva, Ila’s form as male is made permanent. Shuta also tells the story in Book Nine of the *Bhagavata Purana* to introduce the Solar and Lunar Dynasties, and we shall follow his telling.

According to Shuta \(*BP* 9.1.13–42\), the “Manu Son of Sun” named Shraddhadeva sponsored a single sacrifice to both Mitra \(ruler of daytime\) and Varuna \(ruler of nighttime\) to gain a son. Vasishtha supervised the rites as the *brahman* priest. Shraddhadeva’s wife Shraddha, however, wanted a daughter, and the hotri priest followed her will in the *Rig Veda* mantras. Thus was born their daughter named Ila. Manu persuaded Vasishtha to appeal to Hari the Ruler to change Ila into a male, which he did. Ila then became Sudyumna.

One day after the male Sudyumna had matured, he and followers rode horses into the region around Meru, where Shiva dwells with Devi. Immediately—due to Shiva’s previous command that he be the only male there—all the males became females, including the horses. Sudyumna was again Ila. Nevertheless, she continued wandering and came to the ashram of Moon’s son, Budha \(Mercury\). Budha longed for her and she for him; they produced a son named Pururavas. When Pururavas matured, he and the apsaras named Urvashi produced Moon’s descendents to rule Varuna’s nighttime. That was the Lunar Dynasty in the western region of Kurukshetra, whose capital was Hastinapura on the Yamuna River.

Afterward, Vasishtha asked Shiva to restore the female Ila to the male Sudyumna, and he agreed with this stipulation: One month Sudyumna would be a man and one month a woman. Sudyumna-Ila ruled that way long enough to produce three sons who ruled in the southern region \(*daksinapatha*\). Then Sudyumna-Ila left the throne for the forest. In the meantime, the Vaivasvata Manu and his wife had ten sons, the eldest of whom was Ikshvaku. He produced Sun’s descendents to rule Mitra’s daytime. That was the Solar Dynasty in the eastern region of Kosala, whose capital was Ayodhya.

Shuka began his description of the Ilavrita region \(*BP* 5.17\) with the story of Dwarf and Ganga’s descent, as discussed above in the introduction to part III. When Dwarf’s left toenail makes a hole in the edge of spacetime, Ganga emerges through it to flow over his foot onto the region of Dhruva. Dhruva rejoices in the water flowing from the foot of his clan deity \(*kuladeva*\) and sprinkles her on his head. From there she descends onto the matted hair of the Seven Seers, from there through the path of devas to the world of Moon, and from there onto the city of Brahma on mount Meru, flowing in the cardinal directions down Meru’s four sides. Ganga’s southward course flows through Bharata.

Shuka’s story of Ganga’s descent reminds us that the east-facing panels signify energetic \(*rajasika*\) activity on Earth, the central and densest layer of Brahma’s body. The hole in the boundary of Brahma’s body through which Ganga flows corresponds on Earth to the continent of Pushkara, which the first panel illustrates \(Panel E1\). Ganga flows from there onto Dhruva, which the next panel represents \(Panel E2\). The remaining panels portray other illustrations of rajasika activity under Dhruva, including Brahma’s creation of asuras and the Bhagavan’s descents to battle them.

Shuka omitted the familiar story of Shiva breaking Ganga’s fall by letting her fall on his head, a story frequently depicted in other Pallava temples and already discussed in connection with the seer Kapila \(Panel N3\). If we add it to this panel, it repeats Shiva’s subordination to the Bhagavan, for Shiva receives on his head the water flowing over Dwarf’s foot. Moreover, it invokes Brahma at the other corner, for Shiva needed Ganga’s waters to purify him as Bhairava from the sin of cutting off Brahma’s fifth head, which he then had to carry, as the seer Markandeya saw while in samadhi \(*BP* 12.10.11–13\).1 Shiva gazing at the Bhagavan here is Shiva purified of decapitating Brahma there.

The poet Poykai, who lived in the Pallava domain, added the story of Gajendra to those stories in *Tirunvantati* 97:


O mighty warrior

Gracious to the elephant

Attached to his mate,

Shiva joined your feet

And received grace too,

Did he not?

Smeared with ash

He joined his beautiful hands

In oblations to Fire

As Ganga plunged into his matted locks

Adorning them famously with her glitter.


Shiva needed purification because he had cut off Brahma’s fifth head. To atone for grievous brahmanicide \(*brahmahatya*\), he performed a fearful ritual requiring him to wander begging with the skull of Brahma, to smear himself with the ash of human corpses, and to offer pieces of his own body into Fire. He was not freed from the sin, however, until he followed Gajendra’s lead and took refuge in the Bhagavan as true recipient of all fire offerings. The Bhagavan then let Ganga fall onto Shiva’s head and purify him. Her glittering presence in his matted hair thus reminds us that Shiva is the Bhagavan’s dependent.

When Shuka finished the story of Ganga, he described each of the nine regions of Jambu, beginning with Ilavrita at the center. The formation Shiva worships in Ilavrita is Samkarshana the Plower, the delusive formation from which Shiva himself derives. Shiva perceives Samkarshana in samadhi and prays to him \(*BP* 5.17.16\). His prayer in Ilavrita correlates remarkably with another stanza from Poykai’s Tamil antati poem \(above\) and this panel’s position at the southeastern corner. Shiva’s prayer, moreover, summarizes the corner panels of the vimana already noted and anticipates those to come.

Shiva began by addressing the Bhagavan as the Lord who ends bondage for his devotees and continues it for others, all the while unaffected by the threads of his own creativity \(*mayaguna*\) \(*BP* 5.17.17–19\). That refers to Vaikunthanatha as depicted by Panel N1. Shiva then described a form dominated by delusion \(*tamas*\), which the Bhagavan created for those who do not perceive him clearly. He has reddened eyes, he is drunk on liquor, he stimulates naga women erotically when they touch his feet, and he bears the realm of Earth \(*bhumandala*\), the size of a mustard seed, somewhere in his hoods \(*BP* 5.17.20–21\). That refers to Samkarshana in Patala as portrayed by Panel N6.

Shiva then described Vasudeva’s intelligence \(*mahat*\); by thinking the thought “I,” intelligence becomes Brahma. That refers to Brahma with the lotus as portrayed by Panel E1. Shiva then acknowledged that he emerged from Brahma and brought into being the sense organs that function at the center of the universe, notably on Jambu in the region of Bharata \(*BP* 5.17.22\). That refers to Shiva’s appearance in this corner panel. Brahma at the north and Shiva at the south illustrate the beginning and end, as the Pre-eminently Mighty formation determines them from the center.

Shiva’s prayer then alluded forward to the south-facing panel around the corner from this one \(Panel S1\). Brahma and Shiva sit on either side of Vishnu, but in the respectively transformed guises of Soma the Moon and the seer Durvasas sitting with Datta the son of Atri \(Dattatreya\) in the middle. Shiva noted that, like birds tied with strings he holds, the Bhagavan controls all beings within spacetime, including Brahma and himself. As his central position declares, all things begin and end in him. The vyuha sculptures around the bottom sanctum make the same point, for each has Brahma to the right and Shiva to the left. Moreover, Kalikanri made same point verbally in the first stanza of his poem about the temple: “The Speaker is the substance / Of the words He speaks, / Is Taste, Touch, Speech, Smell, and Sight, / Is auspicious Hara, / Is Naranan, / Is Brahma with four faces / And Kacci, beautiful in the rich expanse / Of her realm, is His place.…” In the stanza, “Is auspicious Hara, Is Naranan, Is Brahma with four faces” appears as *nallaran naranan nanmukan* \(Auspicious Destroyer—Narayana—Four Faced\) to replicate verbally the visual order of the vimana and to make the same theological point: Narayana in the center controls the destroyer and the creator.

In his prayer, Shiva also alluded ahead to the last south-facing corner panel \(Panel S6\), which portrays Vishnu’s appearance as the courtesan Mohini \(She Who Deludes\). Since she had once seduced Shiva, he knew of what he spoke. Vasudeva’s maya, Shiva said, deludes the emanation of material threads \(*gunasarga-mohit*\) and binds whoever is born into it with karma. Like Mohini, deluding maya may be known but not easily escaped \(*BP* 5.17.23–24\).

Poykai captured the meaning of this corner panel in *Tiruvantati* 74 by alternatively describing Shiva and the Bhagavan standing side by side. He first mentioned Shiva and then the Bhagavan, which is the order in which the viewer encounters them when walking clockwise \(*pradakshina*\). Poykai depicted the thoughts the viewer has today when trying to understand the panel for the first time:


He rides a bull

He rides a bird.

He burned Tripura in battle

He ripped the chest of Man-lion.

He is ash white

He the color of blue gem.

His body is half woman

His lady is the lotus.

His hair is a matted pile

His crown is tall.

He has Ganga

He has warrior anklets deep down

So He is Protector.


The end of the verse makes the point verbally that the bottom of the panel makes visually: The Bhagavan is taller than Shiva. Shiva’s matted hair contains Ganga, but the Bhagavan’s crown is tall \(*nil*\) and his feet with warrior bracelets stand deep down \(*nil*\) below those of Shiva. He is long \(*nil*\) from head to toe.

Even though in Ilavrita Shiva worships the Plower, he is portrayed here venerating the Pre-eminently Mighty, who rules the rajas “thread” of matter. The sculpture captures the nature of rajas, for it is the source of desire \(*kama*\) and anger \(*krodha*\); they appear respectively as Kamadeva and Rudra Shiva. Kamadeva appears here with Shiva, because Shiva had burned him to ash with his third eye and then smeared that ash over his body.2 In Tamilnadu, that event is liturgically associated with Kama’s marriage to Rati at the Pankuni full moon, as discussed at Panel E5 below. This panel carries the story forward into the month of Chittirai and the new year, for although Shiva burned Kama, it was an act of grace on the part of the Pre-eminently Mighty, which Shiva now acknowledges as the year begins.

The two standing males also allude to Krishna’s two sons by different mothers, Pradyumna and Samba. Pradyumna was Rukmini’s eldest and of the highest status; Samba was the eldest born to Jambavati, the daughter of the ape Jambavan \(*BP* 10.61.8–12\), introduced earlier through the *Ramayana*. Krishna’s son Pradyumna was the burned-up Kama reembodied, and Samba embodied Shiva’s son named Guha and Skanda. Samba manifested Shiva’s destructive function in the Krishna story \(*BP* 3.1.28–30\). The two half-brothers derive from the same Pre-eminently Mighty formation by means of Krishna, just as desire \(*kama*\) and anger \(*krodha*\) emerge from the single thread of passion \(*rajas*\) \(*BG* 3.37\). The half-brothers function as a pair, which is why Goda invoked both Kama deva and his younger brother in the first poem of her *Nacchiyar Tirumoli*.

Samba’s appearance with Pradyumna foreshadows events in Prabhasa represented by the vimana’s south-facing panels. That region on the western coast of Bharata, which is connected to the *Jayakhya-samhita* of the Pancharatra Agama, is where Samba acted to unleash the final destruction of the Vrishnis. Once again, as in Sita’s case, “pregnancy” functioned negatively. Samba dressed up as a pregnant girl and teased seers, who cursed him to give birth to iron, which then became weapons in a drunken battle that resulted in the “deaths” of Balarama and Krishna and the onset of the Kali Yuga. Drunk and violent at Prabhasa, Pradyumna and Samba reversed their serene balance in this panel and fought each other to “death” \(*BP* 11.1 and 30\).

THE PANEL. The panel is divided vertically between two standing males, each royally dressed, possessing two pairs of arms, and facing forward \(Figure 14.2\). They are not quite equal, however, because they stand on different levels. Pradyumna on the south \(the viewer’s left\) stands on the lower level as if in the foreground and gazes straight ahead. He wears a crown and holds the wheel and conch in his back pair of hands. He rests his front right hand on his hip and his front left hand forms a mudra of uncertain shape at his chest.




FIGURE 14.2. Panel E6: Bhava on Kailasa venerates Pradyumna. Photo by Hudson, 1990.


To his left \(the viewer’s right\) Bhava stands on the higher level as if behind Pradyumna and slightly oriented toward him. He is not crowned and his matted hair is piled up on the top of his head. Three of Bhava’s four arms are visible. His back right arm appears to have broken off, but his back left hand rests on his hip to mirror Pradyumna’s posture. His two front hands form damaged mudras at his chest. Two figures at the panel’s top fly inward toward the vertical axis running down Pradyumna’s left side. At the bottom a small chubby figure adjacent to Bhava looks up at Pradyumna and gestures upward with his right hand in praise. He may depict a weapon of Bhava in the shape of a person \(*ayudhapurusha*\).

THE PANEL’S MEANINGS. This panel moves us from the outermost continent of Earth \(represented at the northeast corner\) to Ilavrita at the center of Earth \(represented at this southeast corner\). It identifies this southeast corner panel with the mountain Kailasa standing southeast of Mount Meru, where it is always midday, and this panel represents midday in the Daytime of Boar and midday in the daytime of devas and asuras; the latter begins with the winter solstice as sunrise at the northeast corner, and ends with the summer solstice as sunset at the southwest corner. In the terms of the Vedic solar calender of twelve months, this panel represents its beginning with the month of Chaitra. The previous Panel E5 represents its ending with the month of Phalguna, as we shall see below.

Finally, the figures in this panel reverse the relation of the deva Shiva to the deva Kama as portrayed in the famous story in which Shiva burns Kama to ash; he becomes bodiless, and only his wife Rati can see him \(*Shiva Purana*, Rudra-samhita 1: 8–9; and 3:17–19\). Instead, this panel depicts Shiva as Bhava venerating Pradyumna as Kama, because Kama is the pre-eminently mighty Pradyumna vyuha impelling all that Bhava does.



## **The Four Bracketed Panels**

### ***Panel E2: The Bhagavan Honors Dhruva with the Dhruva Realm***

THE STORY. Maitreya tells this story to Vidura at Haridvara \(*BP* 4.8–12; 5.23.1–3\). It is part of his lengthy teaching about Vasudeva and the creation of the brahmanda \(*BP* 3.5–4.31\). Dhruva, the apex of space visible to the human eye, refers both to a place and to a person. All planets, the stars, the sun, and the moon circumambulate Dhruva like animals attached to an oil press. Surya’s chariot is affixed to Dhruva and to great Meru directly below it, and its wheel runs along the top of the mountain range Manasottora on the outermost continent of Pushkara. Dhruva at the apex of visible space is crucial to the stability and order of chronological time measured by Surya beneath; any person who attains Dhruva goes beyond chronology into Vishnu’s realm \(called Vishnupadam or Vaikunthapadam\), and never returns to Earth to experience death and birth \(*BP* 4.9.20–26\).

The Bhagavan bestows the honor and rule of this realm to Brahma’s great-grandson named Dhruva, son of Uttanapada, who is one of two sons of Shatarupa and Svayambhuva Manu. Brahma is a portion of Hari, Svyambhuva Manu is a portion of this portion, and his sons Priyavrata and Uttanapada are each a part of Vasudeva established to protect the moving universe \(*BP* 4.8.6–8\). When Dhruva is five years old, his father’s second wife, Suruchi, deeply injures his Kshatriya pride by refusing to allow him to sit in his father’s lap with her son Uttama. Dhruva’s mother, Suniti, tells him that if he wants to sits equally in his father’s lap he should worship the Bhagavan. Dhruva leaves the city, and the rishi Narada teaches this boy of five years the practice of visualization \(*dhyana*\) focused on Vasudeva and using the mantra of twelve syllables, Om *namo bhagavate vasudevaya* \(*Om*, veneration to the Bhagavan Vasudeva\).

Dhruva puts Narada’s instruction into practice at Madhuvana on the Yamuna River, and in the fifth month of extraordinary tapas stands on one leg, focuses on Vasudeva in his heart, and controls his breath so completely that everyone in the universe is breathless. Devas seek refuge with the Bhagavan \(*BP* 4.8.40–82\). Vasudeva appears to Dhruva, touches his cheek with His conch, and in a long poem the child utters his profound knowledge \(*BP* 4.9.6–17\). Vasudeva promises Dhruva the honor of residing at the hub of the visible universe in Vishnupadam after he has ruled from his father’s throne for 36,000 years. This five-year-old boy has thus attained Vaikuntha after only six months of tapas.

Dhruva returns home, but is uneasy because he had sought and attained the Atman of the Moving Universe for the sake of worldy gain; when he stood before the grantor of emancipation, mukti was not on his mind due to his injured Kshatriya pride \(*BP* 4.9.27–36\). At the proper age, Dhruva marries Bhrami, the daughter of Shishumara, the Alligator Constellation circling directly beneath the pole star. They have two sons named after measurements of time: The elder is Kalpa \(Daytime of Brahma\) and the younger is Vatsara \(Year\) \(*BP* 4.10.1 and 5.23.4–8\).

One day, one of the mighty guhyakas, who are warriors among Kubera’s yakshas, kills Dhruva’s unmarried brother Uttama while on a hunting trip in the mountainous Punyajanalayam, or Realm of the Meritorious, which is the domain of yakshas. Dhruva goes there and angrily routs guhyaka forces outside their city \(*BP* 4.10.2–20; 4.11.1–35\). During the calm of his victory, however, the guhyakas assault him with asura maya; and Dhruva responds with the Narayanastra \(Narayana’s Arrow or mantra\) and slaughters them viciously. Svayambhuva Manu has compassion for the guhyakas and appears to remind Dhruva that killing out of anger is a sin. Since he knows Hari, why does he do it? Has he forgotten that the Bhagavan is the unmoved mover of the threads of matter? Doesn’t he know that his brother was killed by the power of Time moving these material threads? It’s difficult to understand, Manu admits, but the Bhagavan distinguished in virya is both an agent and a nonagent, both a killer and a nonkiller; and guhyakas did not kill his brother, this Person did, for He is the cause of fate \(*daivam*\). He emanates and destroys everything, but because He has no ego He is not affected by matter’s threads or by karma. Svayambhuva Manu warns Dhruva that his enraged violence has alienated Kubera, Ruler of Wealth, and the well-being of his family is threatened. His grandfather departs, and Dhruva shakes off his anger. Then when Kubera approaches him with others of the region, Dhruva venerates him and is reconciled to the Giver of Wealth.

Dhruva later performs rites addressed to the Person of Sacrifice and gains the perception of Vasudeva in his own atman and in all beings everywhere. Fixed in this perceived knowledge, Dhruva rules for 36,000 years \(*BP* 4.11.33–35; 4.12.1–43\). When he dies, Vasudeva’s blue-skinned and four-armed servants take him up to Vaikunthapada, and on the way Dhruva steps on the head of Death, who is Mrityu \(*BP* 4.12.19–43\). In his devotion to Vasudeva, Dhruva bathes his head in the Ganga as she falls from Vishnu’s feet down through the pole star Dhruva and onto Shiva’s head; from there she flows to Mount Meru’s summit, divides into four branches cascading down to Earth in the north, east, south, and west; and finally flows from the Himalayas eastward through Bharata and across the Realm of Nobles to the sea \(*BP* 5.17.1–2; 1.18.21\).

THE PANEL. The Bhagavan Vasudeva with two pairs of arms sits facing north \(Figure 14.3\). His right thigh and pendent leg hide his bent left leg, the sole of whose foot is visible under his right thigh. His hands in the back hold the wheel and conch. His front pair of hands ties a cloth around the head of Dhruva standing; his left hand holds the end of the cloth and his front right hand touches the top of Dhruva’s head. This rite bestows an honor, and according to the late R. Sundaravarada Bhattacharyar, priest of this temple, when a man receives a mantra the hair is tied up with a cloth in this manner.




FIGURE 14.3. Panel E2: The Bhagavan honors Dhruva with the Dhruva realm. Photo by Sathya Seelan.


Beneath Vasudeva’s throne sits Maitreya, whose tall piled hair appears to be decorated. He has elongated earlobes touching his shoulders, and wears bands around his arms and a cloth dhoti or veshti draping his legs. His left hand reaches up to gesture in praise to the scene above, which illustrates his long narration to Vidura.

THE PANEL’S MEANINGS. This panel represents the pole star Dhruva, located directly above the center of Earth and Mount Meru, the highest visible dimension of directional space visible to the naked eye. It thus represents the upper limit of Heaven, and the axis around which circle the sun, moon, and constellations \(*nakshatra*\), notably the Seven Rishis \(*BP* 5.22–23\). On the human level, it signifies the difficulty of virya for even the most highly developed and devout Bhagavata rulers. Dhruva quickly attained Vaikuntha through tapas as a mere child, yet as a ruler he succumbed to anger at the death of his brother and retaliated viciously. But it also represents the solution to this failure: the perceived knowledge of Vasudeva as the Pre-eminently Mighty whose own virya remains a mystery.

The location of this panel directly after Brahma on the outermost Pushkara continent delineates a juncture in the seven worlds that rise in increasing material purity from Earth to the upper limit of the brahmanda. The corner panel represents the four realms of Vishnupada above Dhruva, whose inhabitants do not experience death and birth; from top down they are Satyaloka, Tapokoka, Janaloka, and Maharloka. This panel represents the three realms beneath the pole star Dhruva, whose inhabitants do experience death and birth; from top down they are Svarloka \(Heaven with the constellations and planets\), Bhuvarloka \(Surya and the atmosphere\), and Bhurloka \(Earth and the seven realms of Rasa beneath\) \(*BP* 2.5.36–42; 5.21–23\). The inhabitants of these three realms include devas and asuras; siddhas, charanas, and vidyadharas; yakshas, rakshasas, pishachas, pretas, bhutas, and human beings. The next panel represents their creation by Brahma.



### ***Panel E3: Brahma Flees to the Bhagavan from His Asura Progeny***

THE STORY. The story of this panel tells of Brahma creating populations for the worlds beneath Dhruva. It is part of the creation sequence told by Shuta to seers during a break from their long fire sacrifice in the Naimisha forest \(*BP* 3.20\). Shuta first tells them what Maitreya had told Vidura about the way Boar killed the asura Hiranyakashipu; and he then tells them this story as if to explain Hiranyakashipu’s asura nature.

The story begins when the Bhagavan is playfully reclining in the primordial waters and enters into Brahma to establish the worlds as before. Brahma emits various forms from his body and then abandons them; an abandoned form then becomes a body for beings; and these beings act according to the nature of the abandoned form that produced them. Brahma begins with his shadow, using it to emit ignorance \(*avidya*\) in five segments: anger, complete darkness of soul, delusion, infatuation, and great confusion. Unhappy with ignorance, he abandons it and it becomes nighttime, the source of hunger and thirst, and of the bodies of yakshas and rakshasas. Hunger and thirst propel these nighttime demons toward Brahma as food, but he persuades them not to eat him because he is their father.

From the splendor of his divinity, Brahma then emits whatever is divine. It becomes daytime, and devas joyfully take it as their bodies. Brahma next produces eager desire or lolupa from his loins and it produces asuras. These lolupa beings see their father Brahma as the object of their lust and approach him to copulate. Brahma laughs at first and then becomes angry. But to his horror, his asura sons are serious, and he flees for protection to the Bhagavan’s feet. Hari takes shape for him, and Brahma pleads for help. Hari advises Brahma to abandon this dreadful \(*ghora*\) state of mind. When he does, his lolupa becomes Samdhya, or Twilight, in the shape of a stunningly beautiful courtesan skilled in manipulating her lusting customers. “What a beautiful figure\!” the asuras proclaim, “What boldness\! What a lovely young age\! She who has no desire is among us who are filled with it\!” Stupidly the asuras think Twilight belongs to them.

Brahma continues to emit beings. Gandharvas and apsaras appear from his beauty, which enjoys itself by itself, and their bodies are made of moonlight. Bhutas and pishachas emerge from his lassitude, naked and with disheveled hair, and their bodies are made from yawning sleep \(and they attack sleepers who drip saliva to create nightmares and madness\). Sadhya rishis and pitri ancestors emerge from Brahma’s invisible energy \(and invisibly consume the havya and kavya offerings in the shraddha rites of the dead\). Siddhas and vidyadharas emerge from Brahma’s power of invisibility and have bodies made of it. Kinnaras and kimpurushas emerge from Brahma’s admiration of his own reflection, and couples in bodies made of it sing Brahma’s praises during morning sacrifices. Eventually Brahma is so frustrated with these creations that in a body of anger he lies down and flails his hands and legs; and when he abandons this body of anger, snakes emerge from its hair and cruel serpents and hooded nagas from its limbs.

At last Brahma’s mind is satisfied, relaxed, and at peace, and the manus emerge from it to populate the world with mankind. Brahma gives humans his own form as person \(*purusha*\), which delights all creatures, because mankind will feed them with the offerings of the prescribed kriya ceremonies. Brahma brings himself under control through tapas and knowledge, engages in yoga, and enters into samadhi. From it come his favorite progeny, the rishi seers. He gives them skills in unified consciousness \(*samadhi*\), in the discipline of consciousness \(*yoga*\), in supernormal powers \(*siddhi*\), in ascetic practice \(*tapas*\), in knowledge \(*vidya*\), and in indifference to worldly enjoyments \(*virakti*\). The rishis begin with their skill in virakti indifference, and they end with the samadhi consciousness that makes them seers.

THE PANEL. The Bhagavan Hari dressed royally and with a tall crown stands with two pairs of arms facing directly eastward \(Figure 14.4\). His back left hand holds the conch. His back right hand holds the wheel as a prayogachakra to signal his opposition to the asuras pursuing Brahma. His front left hand rests on his hip and his front right hand holds the abhayamudra of protection. Two small figures fly above his crowned head with hand gestures raised in praise.




FIGURE 14.4. Panel E3: Brahma flees to the Bhagavan from his asura progeny. AIIS.


To his left, Brahma kneels on both knees, looks downward, and forms the anjalimudra with his front pair of hands, the posture of one seeking protection. He appears to hold his water jar with his back left arm \(not visible in the photograph\), and holds his rosary with his back right hand, which is visible beneath his front right shoulder. Brahma has only one face, as the story indicates, and due to his flight his hair emerges at its sides from beneath his crown.

THE PANEL’S MEANINGS. This panel uses the most controversial event in the story to represent Brahma’s emission of the beings populating the worlds beneath the pole star Dhruva \(as discussed at Panel E2\). It identifies lolupa or eager desire with the male’s genital region or “lap,” and with asuras; and it defines lolupa as opposite to the virya represented by this northeastern side of the temple mandala. It also identifies samdhya, the evening twilight, as especially alluring to asuras for the satisfaction of their eager desire. Twilight has the shape of a courtesan made of lolupa, but she possesses no desire of her own; and Vishnu as Mohini takes her shape at Panel S6. Finally, this panel implies a moral judgment of men who in the evening patronize courtesans: they act like asuras, for they allow their “laps” to lead them to female embodiments of their own lolupa, who then manipulate them, just as Mohini manipulates asuras \(and Shiva\), as we shall see below.



### ***Panel E4: Hanuman Worships Rama in the Kimpurusha Region of Jambu***

THE STORY. The supreme Bhagavata Hanuman resides in the region of Jambu called Kimpurusha, which is directly north of Bharata. According to the *Mahabharata*, he dwells on the Gandhamadana mountain range, a place frequented by kinnaras, gandharvas, and apsaras, home to the rakshasa Kubera, who rules the yakshas, and the location of the ashram of the royal rishi Arishtishena \(*Mbh* 3.155–156; van Buitenen 2: 519–525\). According to the *Bhagavata Purana*, Hanuman dwells there throughout the Kali Yuga, and together with the devotees of this region worships Rama, the brother of Lakshmana and the husband of Sita \(*BP* 5.19.1–8\). The royal rishi Arishtishena leads gandharvas in singing Rama’s story called the *Bhagavatkatha;* and Hanuman chants a brief prayer, which begins *Om namo bhagavate uttamashlokaya* \(*Om* veneration to the Bhagavan Uttamashloka\).

Hanuman venerates the Bhagavan Vasudeva, who as the avatar Rama not only destroys rakshasas but also becomes attached in order to teach people about the dangerous role attachment plays in the rule of a righteous king. Hanuman gives three examples of Rama’s attachments contrary to virya. One is his attachment to Sita as his wife, the cause of his sorrow when Ravana imprisons her in Lanka. Another is his attachment to Sita as mother of his progeny, which causes him pain when he orders Lakshmana to take her while pregnant into the forest and leave her there. The third is Rama’s attachment to his beloved brother Lakshmana, which causes him distress when he banishes Lakshmana to fulfill a promise he had unwittingly made to Time disguised as an ascetic. Nevertheless, Rama’s sovereign attachment can be gracious, for he takes all of Kosala’s inhabitants with him to Heaven when he leaves Earth, and in the Kali Yuga this gives hope to devas, asuras, monkeys, and humans. All the while, of course, the Bhagavan Vasudeva remains unaffected by Rama’s attachments, because his aishvarya acts are those of virya, and God is never entangled by what He does.

The reason Hanuman is in this Gandhamadana mountain range of the Kimpurusha region is explained at the end of Valmiki’s *Ramayana*. When Rama takes his subjects to Heaven, Hanuman chooses to stay on Earth, and Rama tells him to keep in mind his words and to live happily as long as the story of Rama told, which he does \(*Ram* 7.108.32–34\). In the *Mahabharata*, Bhima walks northeast looking for a flower for Draupadi and comes to Gandhamadana, where he encounters Hanuman. The monkey is huge and worn down by age. Hanuman reveals to Bhima the great and vigorous shape he had during Rama’s career, and tells him they are brothers, because the deva Vayu or Wind is father to them both. Hanuman promises to assist his much younger brother during battle: At strategic moments he will ferociously roar from his perch on the flagstaff of Bhima’s younger brother, Arjuna, who is Indra’s son, Krishna’s friend, and future hero of the Great War \(*Mbh* 3.146–150\).

The stories of Rama’s final three acts, when separated from the surrounding stories that elaborate narrative details, recapitulate Valmiki’s *Ramayana* from the time Rama took the throne in Ayodhya to his ascension with Bharata and Satrughna into the “deva made of Vishnu” \(*visnumaya deva*\). The light they shed on this panel reveals just how sophisticated a work of visual literature the temple is.

RAMA SEPARATES FROM SITA \(*R**AM* 7.42–49; 51–52; 91–99\). After Rama returned to Ayodhya as king, he and Sita spent about two years of pleasure in the royal Ashoka grove, and Sita became pregnant. Rama asked what would satisfy the desires her beautiful \(*kalyana*\) condition generated, and she said a visit to the pure forests of ascetic practice on the banks of the Ganga. Rama said she would go the next day. That evening, however, Rama learned what men in Ayodhya were saying: “After Rama had astoundingly built the bridge to Lanka, slayed Ravana, and subdued the rakshasas, he subdued his indignation \(*amarsha*\) and took Sita back into his house. What kind of pleasure born of his union with Sita is there in his heart? Ravana seized her bodily and took her by force to Lanka where rakshasas kept her in the Ashoka grove. Why does Rama not despise her who was subject to the will of rakshasas? We will have to treat our wives the same way, because the subjects follow the lead of the king” \(*Ram* 7.43.14–19\). Sita’s pregnancy was the occasion for the male gossip. Was Rama really the father? It was not Ravana, because it had been too long since his death, but it could be someone in the court, because once “polluted” by the touch and world of rakshasas, Sita would lust after other men in the way Shurpanakha had lusted after Rama and Lakshmana. Worse of all, Rama’s desire for Sita must be corrupt, because he took her back even though “polluted.” Consequently, if their own wives become pregnant by others, they will have to keep them and raise the children as their own, because they have to do what the king does. The gossip thus circled around the nature of Rama’s pleasure in Sita, born as it was from sexual union with her.

Infamy or shame \(*akirti*\) is the greatest of dangers for a ruler, and Rama feared it. With enormous sorrow he therefore instructed Lakshmana to take Sita across the Ganga the next morning and leave her there. Sita thus got her wish to visit the forests of pure ascetic practice, but not as she had intended. In the forest, Varuna’s son, the seer Valmiki, who knew what was happening because he wrote the *Ramayana*, found Sita and took her to his ashram to live. In Valmiki’s ashram Sita gave birth to twin boys, Kusha and Lava. When they matured, they looked just like their father \(*Ram* 7.94.14–15\).

In the meantime, Lakshmana learned from his charioteer that the seer Durvasas had earlier told Rama’s father, Dasharatha, that one day Rama would suffer separation from those dear to him, because Vishnu had long ago been cursed by Bhrigu. Vishnu had angrily cut off the head of Bhrigu’s wife because she had given refuge to his daitya enemies. Bhrigu therefore cursed Vishnu to be a man who, like him, suffers separation from his innocent wife. Vishnu accepted the curse for the welfare of the world. Lakshmana was comforted by that explanation, and when he returned to Rama he advised him not to grieve, because Kala \(Time\) brings everything to an end. Since the rumor about Sita would no doubt circle Ayodhya again, he said, Lakshmana advised Rama to restrain himself and take satisfaction in performing his royal duties, which Rama did.

After some years, Rama performed a horse sacrifice, to which the twin sons he did not know came to sing the *Ramayana* Valmiki had composed. While listening to it, Rama learned that Kusha and Lava were Sita’s sons \(*Ram* 7.95.2\). He quickly sent a messenger to Valmiki asking him to bring Sita back to Adyodhya for a public testimony to her purity.

Valmiki arrived with Sita in the midst of Ayodhya’s great crowd and testified that he, Varuna’s son, had never told a lie and that Sita was absolutely pure. Rama then replied that her purity had already been proven in Lanka and that he had forsaken her “from fear of the world” even while he knew she was sinless. In everyone’s sight Rama then proclaimed Kusha and Lava to be his sons and testified to his love \(*priti*\) for Sita who is pure \(*shuddha*\). At that point, divine beings and seers led by Brahma arrived; once again Rama spoke his love for pure Sita in public.

It was now Sita’s turn. Dressed in the ochre \(*kashaya*\) garments of an ascetic and gazing downward she said: “If I have never thought of another man but Rama, may Goddess Madhavi grant me an opening. If I venerate only Rama with mind, act, and speech, may Goddess Madhavi grant me an opening. If I speak in truth that no one other than Rama is known to me, may Goddess Madhavi grant me an opening” \(*Ram* 7.97.13–16\). Suddenly, a wondrous throne supported by nagas and holding Goddess Dharani arose out of the earth. The Goddess graciously took Sita by the hand, seated her on the throne with her, and descended into the realm of Taste \(Rasatala\). Sita had returned to her origin.

Everyone else rejoiced, but Rama wept in anger and sorrow. As he watched “Majesty in the shape of Sita” \(*sita shririva rupini*\) disappear into the arms of his mother-in-law, Goddess Vasudha, he experienced a sorrow unlike anything before; he threatened to wreak havoc on earth \(*bhumi*\) if she did not return his wife. Brahma spoke up to assure Rama that he would join Sita in heaven \(*svarga*\), and told him to listen to the remainder of the *Ramayana* to learn of his future \(*Ram* 7.97–98\). The next morning, Rama resumed listening to Kusha and Lava recite the *Ramayana*. Now he learned that he would never marry again and that a golden image of Sita would serve as queen during his sacrifices. He learned of the prosperity and well-being of his kingdom, of the deaths of his mothers Kausalya, Sumitra, and Kaikeyi, and of the thousands of years he would rule in harmony with Dharma \(*Ram* 7.99\).

RAMA BANISHES LAKSHMANA \(*R**am* 7.103–106\). One day, Kala \(Time\) appeared in the guise of an ascetic at Rama’s door. He told Lakshmana that he had a great message for Rama. After Lakshmana admitted him to Rama’s presence, the ascetic told him that his message was only between the two of them and if anyone else heard or even saw them, Rama must kill him. Rama agreed and told Lakshmana to guard the door himself and repeated the punishment. The ascetic then told Rama:

In your previous existence I was your son, Kala, arising from maya as destroyer of all. The Grandfather \(Brahma\), who is the venerable master of the world, has sent me to tell you:

“O Bhagavan, the time you set for protecting the world has been fulfilled. Prior to emanation, you destroyed the worlds with your maya, and while lying on the great waters you gave birth to me. Then by maya you produced the endless hooded Naga to lie above, and the powerful Madhu and Kaitabha, whose bones covered the earth as mountains to make it Medini. After you produced the shining lotus at your navel and then me, you assigned me the work \(*karma*\) belonging to the Master of Progeny \(*Prajapati*\). Acting accordingly, I asked you to protect the moving universe \(*jagat*\).

“From the eternal Bhagavan you became Vishnu, and through Aditi you were born as Dwarf. When you resolved to kill Ravana, you decided to rule for 11,000 years. Thus as the ‘son made of mind’ \(*manomaya putra*\) your years among men are completed and Kala has been sent to you. If you wish to continue among men you may, of course, but if you wish to protect the world of devas, they need Vishnu as their lord.” \(*Ram* 7.104.1–15\)

Rama laughingly told the destroyer of all that he would act according the wondrous words of the deva of devas and would return to the place from which he had come.

Significantly, Rama’s end came at the beginning of the twelfth millennium of his rule. That corresponds to the twelfth month of the year, which in Tamil is Pankuni \(Phalguna\). This first of two panels representing Pankuni suggests the month’s beginning.

In the meantime, however, the seer Durvasas appeared at Rama’s door and insisted that Lakshmana admit him immediately. When Lakshmana refused, Durvasas’s anger was uncontrollable and he threatened to curse Lakshmana, the region of Bharata, and all Raghu’s lineage. Thinking it would be best if only he died and not others, Lakshmana interrupted Rama’s meeting with the ascetic to report Durvasas’s arrival. Rama immediately left Kala to receive Durvasas, who had just completed a thousand-year fast and wanted to honor Rama by allowing him to feed him his first cooked food \(*bhojana*\). After Rama fed him, Durvasas left in satisfaction for his ashram. But remembering Kala’s words, Rama grieved that his family would die.

Lakshmana saw Rama grieving and urged him to keep his word about the interruption and punish him, for men who do not keep their promises go to purgatory \(*naraka*\). Rama was distressed and consulted his advisors. Vasishtha said that Kala is too powerful to resist and agreed that for the sake of Dharma, Rama had to keep his promise to kill anyone who interrupted his meeting with Kala. Rama turned to Lakshmana and instead of killing him, told him to leave; sadhus, he said, agree that forsaking \(*tyaga*\) someone is the same as killing \(*vadha*\) him.

Immediately Lakshmana left. He did not return home, but went directly to the Sarayu River, where he performed rites and began restraining his senses in yoga. Indra, devas, apsarases, and seers then appeared, sprinkled flowers on him, and, in a body invisible to humans, took him to Indra’s realm. Devas rejoiced at “the return of one of Vishnu’s four portions” \(*Ram* 7.106.18\).

RAMA TAKES ALL INHABITANTS OF KOSALA TO HEAVEN \(*R**AM* 7.107–110\). Once Lakshmana had left, Rama began preparations to follow in his footsteps. He asked his gathered subjects what they wanted him to do for them. They said that if he were pleased with them, to take them and their progeny and spouses to heaven with him; out of love \(*priti*\) they wanted to follow him. Rama acknowledged their steadfast bhakti and agreed \(*Ram* 7.107.16\).

Rama decided to consecrate Bharata king of Ayodhya, but Bharata insisted on following him. He therefore anointed Kusha the ruler of south Kosala at Kushavati in the Vindhyas, and Lava the ruler of north Kosala at Shravasta. In the meantime, Shatrughna at Madhura \(Mathura\) on the Yamuna River anointed his son Subahu ruler at Madhura and his son Shatrughati ruler at Vidisha. Alone, he traveled eastward to Ayodhya to join Rama for his final journey. At that point, Sugriva appeared in Ayodhya from the south, leading monkeys who change shape at will, apes, and rakshasas. They wanted to see Rama leave for heaven. Similarly, sons of devas, of seers, and of gandharvas arrived from the north to ask to go with Rama. Sugriva told Rama he had anointed Valin’s son, Angada, as ruler in order to follow him. Rama agreed to let them all accompany him.

Rama then addressed Vibhishana. He told him to rule in Lanka as long as the sun, the moon, and Medini remain, to protect the world, and to worship the Ikshvaku clan deity Jagannatha \(Lord of the Moving Universe\), whom Indra and the devas should also forever worship. Rama then spoke to Hanuman. As long as his story \(*katha*\) circulates, he said, so long will Hari be Ruler in the world. “Keep my words in mind and live happily” \(*Ram* 7.108.32–34\). Rama next turned to Jambavat, the ancient son of Brahma, and to all five sons of Jambavat together, and said, “You will live as long as the Kali Yuga persists” \(*Ram* 7.108.36–38\). That explains why Jambavat was alive during Krishna’s lifetime and had a daughter, Jambhavati, who became Krishna’s wife and gave birth to Samba.

In the morning, Vasishtha performed the rites for the great departure \(*mahaprasthana*\), and Rama walked westward toward the Sarayu River. The shape of Goddess Shri with the lotus walked silently at his right and Goddess Mahi walked at his left, followed by males and females, birds, flocks of animals, monkeys, and those who came to watch. They reached the place in the river to depart for heaven and Brahma appeared. He asked Rama to enter with his brothers into his own form \(*tanu*\), either into that pertaining to Vishnu or into eternal space. Rama chose to enter Vishnu in a body of tejas, along with Bharata and Satrughna. Devas then worshiped “the deva made of Vishnu” \(*Ram* 7.110.9–15\).

Vishnu of great tejas now instructed Brahma to admit those who followed him out of love \(*sneha*\) into a realm, and gave a promise of hope for all ages: “Bhaktas who have pursued me and renounced themselves for me attain me” \(*Ram* 7.110.17\). Brahma obeyed and granted them places in the worlds called Santana, a part of Visnu’s realm \(*vishnupada*\) close to Brahma’s world, which shares its qualities \(*guna*\). All the monkeys and apes born of devas then returned to their origins, and Sugriva entered the sphere of Sun \(*suryamandala*\). Everyone else who wanted to follow Rama, including animals and unmoving objects, apes, monkeys, and raksasas, entered the river, gained divine forms, and entered deva worlds \(*Ram* 7.110\).

That ends the story. A final chapter describes the benefits derived from reading and listening to Valmiki’s great kavya.

THE PANEL. Rama appears in this panel as an icon standing on a pedestal \(Figure 14.5\). He is dressed royally, wears a tall crown, and faces eastward with two pairs of arms. His back left hand holds the conch and his back right hand holds the wheel positioned as a prayogachakra. His front left hand rests on his lower hip, and at his right breast his damaged right hand forms what appears to be the abhayamudra of protection matching the prayogachakra above it.




FIGURE 14.5. Panel E4: Hanuman worships Rama in the Kimpurusha region of Jambu \(prior to repair\). Photo by Hudson, 1992.


Hanuman appears with one pair of arms in the shape he had during Rama’s career. He wears a short dhoti or veshti tied up as if for wrestling and his hair is piled up, or perhaps he wears a crown. He kneels to Rama’s right at the base of the icon’s pedestal, his right knee and his left foot resting on the ground below it as he bends down toward Rama’s feet with the anjalimudra of veneration. The small figure of a gandharva flies at Rama’s right above and behind Hanuman; no complementary gandharva appears on Rama’s left side. The royal seer Arishtishena is not depicted.

THE PANEL’S MEANINGS. This panel represents the Kimpurusha region of the Jambu continent, directly north of Bharata, and depicts the aishvarya sovereignty of Vasudeva’s avatar as Rama the son of Dasharatha, whose story Valmiki tells in his *Ramayana*. Specifically, it represents the ending of Valmiki’s *Ramayana*, which tells of Rama’s sovereign rule of Kosala after he, Sita, and Lakshmana had returned from Lanka and he was anointed king. Brahma appears in the stories to continue his role from the three previous east-facing panels, but as supervisor not of the beginning but of the end. Brahma’s messenger is Time, and the hunger and thirst of yaksas and raksasas from his shadow now appear in Durvasas.

The depiction of Hanuman praying to the icon of Rama signals that puja worship with true bhakti is the means by which the Bhagavan’s sovereignty overrules His own implacable Time \(*kala*\). Time destroys all things, endings are painful, and beautiful pregnancy as a beginning is an occasion for ugly thoughts leading to an end. The beauty \(*kalyana*\) of Sita’s pregnancy reveals that the king’s dharma to maintain the kingdom’s stability and prosperity costs his dharma as husband and father. Even though Sita makes him whole as his wife and becomes his “mother” at the birth of his sons, he must abandon her and them for the sake of his inherited kingship. When Rama told Lakshmana to take Sita away, he told one part of himself to cut off another part. Just as his father’s faithfulness to dharma had ended his life with the pain of separation, Rama’s life would end the same way. Time ends all things, endings lead to separation and death, and separation and death are painful.

Rama banished Lakshmana to reveal that not only must the king be free from shame or infamy, even if such a charge is based on a lie, he must also be faithful to his word, no matter where it leads. At the same time, a ruler must be grateful to his advisors, who cannot erase words but through interpretation can mitigate their impact. Rama’s words were Time’s way to bring Rama’s story to an end.

Finally, the subjects of Kosala represent bhaktas of all kinds, and Rama emancipates them all, which is why the otherwise distressing ending of the *Ramayana* remains a source of hope for Rama bhaktas in this Kali Yuga. The ascent of Kosala’s inhabitants to the highest heavens reveals bhakti to be the solution to Time’s tyranny of beginnings that lead to endings. Rama dearly loves those who dearly love him, all of whom will ascend beyond Dhruva to the worlds of Vishnu’s realm \(*vishnupada*\).



### ***Panel E5: Kamadeva in the Ketumala Region of Jambu Plays “Krishna Holding up Govardhana”***

THE STORY. West of Mount Meru on the Jambu continent is the Ketumala region ruled by Vatsara \(Year\), the younger son of Dhruva and Bhrami \(*BP* 5.18.15–23\). Vatsara the Year begets 36,000 sons as days and 36,000 daughters as nights. His sons and daughters marry each other, and these pairs constitute 36,000 day-and-nights or ahoratras. Each year the 36,000 wives become pregnant, but at year’s end the tejas of the wheel Sudarshana frightens them and they give birth to stillborn babies. In Ketumala the Bhagavan appears as the essential shape of Kamadeva \(the Lord of Senses\), and Goddess Lakshmi resides there as Ramadevi, “the Dear One.” Kamadeva delights Ramadevi and Vatsara’s 36,000 sons and 36,000 daughters as they watch him play.

This panel portrays the Lord of Senses entertaining Ramadevi and the others with a play \(*lila*\) about the time in Krishna’s life in Gokula he lifted the mountain Govardhana \(*BP* 5.18.16–17\). The panel resembles a seventh-century Mamallapuram relief in a cave-mandapa of Krishna lifting Govardhana.3 In the two depictions Krishna’s posture is the same, but the Mamallapuram relief also depicts Balarama standing under the mountain with Nanda and Yashoda, and Pinnai standing under it with Krishna and other gopis. In ancient Tamil lore, Pinnai is Krishna’s cowherd wife whom he won by slaying seven demons disguised as bulls, a story Kalikanri referred to in his penultimate stanza about the temple: “Pinnai’s forehead is a / Gleaming crescent moon / And she’s a cousin, / So long ago in battle / He subdued deceiving Lust / In the shape of seven bulls, / And now owns beautiful Kacci / With its surrounding wealth // Where the Sovereign of Pallavas / Serves the Vishnu-house he built / after he conquered those / angry kings with swords / stained black from blood / As the Emperor who owns / The Drum with a bitter mouth / And the Conch with the roar of the sea” \(*PT* 2.9.9\). The stanza correlates Krishna’s desire for Pinnai and his act to satisfy it with Nandivarman’s sovereign acts as Bhagavata emperor. It illustrates vividly the meaning of the east-facing panels and particularly this panel’s depiction of Krishna lifting Govardhana.

The *Bhagavata Purana* does not say how Kamadeva in Ketumala was entertaining Ramadevi and the sons and daughters of Year, so the designers decided to depict him enacting the play \(*lila*\) about Govardhana. That episode represents the sovereignty \(*aishvarya*\) appropriate to the east-facing side and to the month of Pankuni corresponding to this panel.

Indra, whose capital is in the east, is responsible for rains. Krishna lifted Govardhana as an umbrella to shield Gokula from the excessive rains Indra brought because of jealousy \(*BP* 10.24–27\). Those rains refer to the monsoon important to the Pallava realm, which comes from the east and falls as the northeast monsoon. In the ninth century \(assuming that weather patterns a millennium ago resembled those of today\), the rains fell during the months of Karttikai \(Krittika\) and Markali \(Margashirsha\) and ended around the winter solstice.4 As discussed in chapter 13, the entire north-facing side of the vimana represents the month of Markali and the rains of the northeast monsoon. The east-facing corner panel of Brahma with the lotus represents the “sunrise” of the winter solstice.

This panel, far from that Brahma panel, represents the end of Pankuni, which is the month of the vernal equinox long after the monsoon and the twelfth month of the year. It falls under the protective jurisdiction of the murti Govinda, and the name Govinda refers to Krishna lifting Mount Govardhana. After Indra admitted defeat, he became Krishna’s devotee. Krishna put the mountain back in place, and Indra and Surabhi, the Cow of cows, consecrated him with the heroic title “Indra of Cows” \(Govinda\) \(*BP* 10.27\). For the unction \(*abhisheka*\), Surabhi poured milk and Indra poured Ganga water.

The murti Govinda protects the three hot months that begin with Pankuni \(*Satvata-samhita* 8.1–136; Smith 1975: 521\). Their heat is connected to erotic heat and pregnancy, for on Pankuni’s full moon connected to the vernal equinox, Erotic Desire \(*Kama*\) and his wife Erotic Pleasure \(*Rati*\) unite as a couple, a paradigm of marriage. A girl who had bathed in Markali’s cold waters for the sake of a husband and prosperity, as Goddess Rama noted in her prayer, would have had her marriage arranged during the three months after the winter solstice—Tai, Machi, Pankuni—which are known today as the “wedding season.” Ideally, the wedding ceremony would take place around Pankuni’s full moon or later, because any child conceived through the initial coupling would be born after the following winter solstice in the auspicious light half rather than in the inauspicious dark half of the year.5

Ketumala in the panel not only represents the month that ends the solar year and begins three hot months, but also the marriage and pregnancy of Year’s 36,000 male days and female nights. The panel affirms erotic desire within marriage and reveals its inevitable ending, as does the *Ramayana* as illustrated by the previous panel. Time brings all things to an end. Goddess Rama’s prayer reveals the solution: consecration to the service of the Bhagavan, who as the Pre-eminently Mighty Lord of Senses satisfies all desire in himself. This panel thus signifies the consecration \(*diksha*\) of the bhakta whose love for God the previous panel introduced.

POEMS ADDRESSED BY GODA \(ANTAL\) TO THE RULER OF SENSES. Goddess Rama’s reference in her prayer to women performing vows \(*vrata*\) to attain husbands alludes to a bathing vow that girls performed during the Tamil months of Markali \(Margashirsha\) and Tai \(Pushya\). In her two works, *Tiruppavai* and *Nacciyar Tirumoli*, the ninth-century poet Goda \(Antal\) linked that bathing vow to other rites that continued into the month of Pankuni \(Hudson 1980, 1982\). Her desire resembled the desire of Ramadevi’s prayer, and her sadhana reveals that she had received the vishnuhasta that Goddess Rama longed for.

In *Tiruppavai*, Goda recorded the liturgical awakening of Madhusudana at the temple in Villi’s New Town during the month of Markali. She recorded her sadhana’s visualization \(*dhyana*\) in that poem: The gathered worshipers in New Town were gopis at Nanda’s house attempting to awaken Krishna so that he would give them the ritual implements they required for their vowed predawn bath and worship of Goddess Chandika Durga Katyayani. The intent of that bathing vow was to gain the majestic pleasure \(*bhukti*\) of serving Krishna forever. The means to it was Krishna’s gopi wife Pinnai, and they succeeded because they enlisted her on their side.

In the fourteen poems of *Nacciyar Tirumoli*, however, Goda went beyond bhukti to mukti; she used her sadhana’s visualization \(*dhyana*\) to become Pinnai lying in bed with Krishna in Nanda’s house \(Hudson 1993c; 1995–1996\). Goda had already identified Pinnai as Goddess Shri \(*Tiruppavai* 20\). She began this sadhana on the first day of Pankuni and describes it in detail in the first of *Nacciyar Tirumoli’s* fourteen poems. She tells us that from first day of Tai, through the whole month of Machi, to the first day of Pankuni, she had performed rites to enlist the aid of Krishna’s son Kamadeva and his younger half-brother Samba. She described the morning puja she offered the bodiless Kama by writing his name on a wall, her processions with liturgists in New Town’s streets, and the food she cooked for him. Those rites end in the late morning represented by this panel. The task she assigned Kama as Lord of Senses was to bring her to Krishna in Vrindavana by the time of Pankuni’s full moon:


The whole month of Tai

I purified the ground

And laid a graceful mandala,

From the first day of Machi

I decorated the streets with fine sand

And made them beautiful,

O god without a body,

“Will I ever live?” I wondered

And worshiped you and your younger brother,

You can direct me to the Lord of Venkatam

Who holds the incomparable Wheel

Spitting hot fire

Can’t you? \(1\)

I decorated the streets with fine white sand,

Bathed in a pond before the sky grew light,

Fed thornless branches to a fire,

And endured all for you,

O god of Desire—

You can make a honey-filled flower

Your arrow,

Write on it the incomparable name

“Ocean Colored Lord”

And shoot me into the target

“He Split the Mouth of the Bird”

Can’t you? \(2\)

Holding coral tree blossoms

And flowers with sweet intoxicating fragrance

I worshiped your feet three times a day,

And if my burning heart said,

“He is not real”

I didn’t speak it and slander you at all—

You can make clusters of blooming flowers Your arrow,

Write on it the incomparable name

“Govinda”

And shoot me into the Light of

“Wisdom Residing on Venkatam”

Can’t you? \(3\)

I wrote your ancient name on a wall,

And while facing it showed you

Auspicious flags bearing your shark emblem,

Horses, ladies waving yak-tail fans,

Bows of sugarcane,

And I gave them all to you,

Didn’t you notice, O god of Desire?—

My swollen breasts

Craving since youth

Are meant for Dvaraka’s Lord alone,

So I have been worshiping you

For you can make that happen quickly,

Can’t you? \(4\)

My full and swollen breasts

Meant for the Supreme Being

Whose body bears the Wheel and Conch

Are like food set aside by Brahmins

In the sacrifice for gods in heaven—

If you say they’re meant for a man,

That’s like a fox wandering

From the forest into the altar

To lick, smell, and pick the food over,

And I won’t go on living,

Don’t you see, Manmatha? \(5\)

Every day I appear on the street with

Handsome men, young men, learned men,

Skillful reciters of hymns

To observe Pankuni perfectly, O god of Desire—

So you should graciously make him

Whose skin is dark like a black cloud,

a purple Kaya flower,

or the sky-blue Karuvilai

Look at me through his auspicious eyes

In his splendid lotus face,

Don’t you see? \(6\).

I cook green paddy with sugarcane,

And new rice with brown sugar for aval,

And worship you with mantras

Sung by Brahmins of good voice, O Manmatha—

So give me this world’s greatest glory,

The touch of Trivikrama

Who long ago measured the land,

His auspicious hands on my lustrous belly

And soft full breasts,

Won’t you? \(7\).

My body is tarnished,

My hair is disheveled,

My lips are colorless,

And I eat only once,

O splendid and able god of Desire,

Don’t you notice the vow I endure?—

Don’t you know my lord?

Only one thing’s left to say:

Graciously crown my womanhood

By making this true:

“She will seize the feet

Of her beloved Keshava.” \(8\)

I worship you three times a day,

Venerate your feet,

Toss pure flowers in adoration,

And sing your praise,

But I faultlessly serve only him

Whose color is the sea surrounding the earth—

And if I don’t get true life

I’ll run wild

Weeping and wailing

Crying out “Mother\!”

And you’ll be thoroughly disgraced,

As if after yoking an ox to the plow

You worked it but never fed it,

Don’t you see? \(9\)

By venerating the feet of Lord Kama

Whose bow is sugarcane and arrows are flowers

And by telling him,

“The one there who ripped off the tusk

Of the incomparable roaring elephant

And split the mouth of the bird,

He the color of blue gem,

Set me aside for him.”

Goda, the daughter of Vishnucitta,

King of those who reside in New Town

Where storied houses soar like mountains,

Wove this Tamil garland out of desire,

And whoever recites it skillfully

Will no doubt reach the feet of the King

Ruling those who reside in Vishnu’s Realm. \(10\)


On her sadhana’s second day, Goda began visualizing herself as Pinnai growing up in Gokula to become the bride Krishna would win by slaying seven bulls. In each poem she documented her increasingly complex experience as Pinnai in relationship to Gopala Krishna, until the fourteenth day. That night the full moon would appear. Goda’s goal was union with Krishna in the manner of Sri Lakshmi’s union with Vasudeva. No poem records her experience on the fifteenth and full moon day; her silence, we may surmise, testifies to the samadhi she attained.

THE PANEL. The Bhagavan in the shape of Kamadeva \(Figure 14.6\) has two arms standing in the familiar posture of Krishna lifting the mountain Govardhana found elsewhere in Pallava sculpture—most notably at Mamallapuram, where Krishna is depicted as if holding up with one hand the entire cliff on which the famous “Descent of the Ganges” is carved. Kamadeva as Krishna turns his body slightly northward and faces his head with a tall crown tilted slightly southward toward the viewer. He rests his right hand on his right hip as his straight left arm rises at a slight angle pushing upward as if against the bottom of the imagined hill Govardhana. His straight right leg faces the viewer, and his left foot casually rests on a higher elevation.

Slightly behind Kamadeva to his left are two badly damaged figures. Vatsara the Year stands with his head at the level of Kamadeva’s chest. He stretches his left arm northward and holds his right hand at his breast as if forming a mudra. In front of him Ramadevi sits with legs crossed in the posture suitable for yoga and forms the anjalimudra of veneration with her two hands. Her head is at the level of Kamadeva’s left knee and thigh, and she appears to wear a breast band.

THE PANEL’S MEANINGS. This panel represents the Ketumala region of the Jambu continent, which is west of Mount Meru; it also represents the ending of the Vedic solar year with the month of Phalguna. The solar year begins with the month of Chaitra, which corresponds to the next panel, Panel E6 at the southeast corner. The ending of this solar year told as an allegory of a lifetime of one hundred years is signified by this panel.

The Year, derived from Dhruva as his son Vatsara, is measured by Surya’s course beneath the pole star Dhruva \(of Panel E2\); it consists of 360 day-and-nights \(*ahoratra*\). Vatsara the Year replicates these 360 ahoratras through his progeny, which as couples are the sum of a lifetime of one hundred years. These couples are 36,000 daytime sons and 36,000 nighttime daughters united by eager desire or lolupa \(Panel E3\). These ahoratra couples begin each year pregnant with possibilities, but each year ends with these possibilities stillborn due to Sudarshana’s tejas. Sudarshana in this allegory represents the Wheel of Time impelled by desire \(*kama*\) producing intent \(*iccha*\) and performance \(*kriya*\). The Wheel of Time brings everything it conceives to an end, just as the previous Panel E4 tells us through the three stories by which Valmiki brings the *Ramayana* to its end.

Kamadeva playing in Ketumala depicts the Pre-eminently Mighty formation’s aishvarya sovereignty over the desire he instills. Pradyumna’s lila as Govardhana Krishna evokes the story in the Krishnakatha in which Indra, king of devas and motivated by desire, acknowledges the sovereignty of Krishna with the title Govinda.

Finally, Ramadevi in the panel represents the bhakta’s longing for formal consecration as Kamadeva’s slave or servant through the vishnuhasta rite, the touch of the acharya’s hand on the disciple’s head. This confers a relationship to the Lord of Senses, preferred to all the majesty and wealth bestowed by the Shrivatsa on Vishnu’s chest, for it satisfies all desires, even for the mukti Dhruva attains in Panel E2.
