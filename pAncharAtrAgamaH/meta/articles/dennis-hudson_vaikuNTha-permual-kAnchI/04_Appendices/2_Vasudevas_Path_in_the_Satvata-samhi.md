#### The Satvata System

To perceive God in all things and all things in God is to be wide awake \(*sambuddha*\). If one is wide awake, one’s death will be “extinguishing into *brahman*” \(*brahmanirvana*\) and eternal presence in God’s supreme home \(*dhama parama*\). Only a few Bhagavatas attain this goal, because it requires the sadhaka’s full attention day and night and God’s grace. But every serious devotee can begin walking the path even if most go only the minimum distance. The path is “Approaching the Honey of the Lotus Feet,” and the feet are Krishna’s as he dances on Kaliya. Vasudeva described this path to the Plower as a body of teachings now found in the *Satvata-samhita*.

According to the first chapter of the *Satvata-samhita*, in the Treta Yuga the Vasudeva formation is perceived as red \(*rakta*\) in color. His Plower formation asks him why and he says that his color depends on the faith of his devotees; in the Treta Yuga their faith is mixed with passion \(*raga*\) and therefore he appears red. The Plower asks Vasudeva how to remove this passion. He answers that passion has difficulty remaining in refugees \(*prapanna*\) who turn devout attention to three modes of the Supreme *Brahman* \(*parama brahma*\). The first mode is as the supreme \(*para*\), the second is as formation \(*vyuha*\), and the third is as secondary emanation \(*vibhava*\) \(*SS* 1.2.2–27\). Vasudeva teaches the Plower how to worship these three modes and says his teachings constitute the Satvata system \(*satvata-shastra*\). The Satvata system thus emerges from a conversation within the Supreme *Brahman* between the primal formation of pure consciousness and its first rearrangement as consciousness intentionally deluded.

Later the Plower teaches this Satvata system to Parashurama \(Rama with the Axe\), who by then resides in the Malaya Mountains in the ancient realm of the Pandyas and Cheras \(*SS* 1; Smith 1975: 515–516\). Sometime later the deva seer Narada visits Parashurama and learns this secret teaching from him. Parashurama tells Narada to pass it on to the seers living in ashrams in the surrounding Malaya Mountains. Narada’s teaching then becomes the scripture compiled among Dravidas as the *Satvata-samhita*.

In this context Parashurama’s famous axe \(*parashu*\) is noteworthy. It represents “nonclinging” \(*asanga*\) as the instrumental means to remove the passion that causes one to see Vasudeva as red in color. Krishna refers to this axe in *Bhagavad-gita* 15.1–6, where he tells Arjuna to cut down the cosmic fig tree. The fig tree known as asvattha or pippala is a metaphor for a material body infused with the sap of passion; the body may be Brahma’s body of spacetime or the sadhaka’s body or both. The fig tree’s well-nourished root springs from a seed dropped by a bird up high on a host tree; the root throws out branches in all directions and sends subsidiary roots down to the ground to create a shaded world. Birds restlessly flit from branch to branch to eats its figs. Krishna tells Arjuna to use the axe of nonclinging \(*asanga-shastra*\) to chop down this tree and then, like a free bird, fly to Krishna’s supreme home \(*dhama parama*\) beyond directional space and chronological time. Vasudeva teaches the details of this “chopping” to the Plower in the *Satvata-samhita*. “Chopping” with nonclinging is the only way to approach and taste the honey of Krishna’s lotus feet.



#### Consecration to Man-lion

Chopping at the fig tree with the axe of nonclinging begins when a man or woman of any class or caste seeks refuge at the feet of an acharya. The refugee then lives with the acharya for months to receive training and purification \(*SS* 16.1–37; Smith 1975: 526\). The refugee’s waking consciousness during this period is like a raging ocean full of “graspers” \(*graha*\) and resists being banked, dammed, or channeled by the acharya’s discipline. The most powerful means to begin building the required embankment \(*setu*\) is “Consecration to the Lion as Man” or the “Man-lion Consecration” \(*nrisimha-diksha*\). Anyone may receive it and most devotees require it. The consecration ceremonies last at least seven days and possibly months; it is described in chapter 15 at Panel S4 \(*SS* 17; Smith 1975: 527–528\). They confer on the sadhaka a twelve-syllable mantra to kill the sin and impurity of waking consciousness centered on “This am I” \(*ahamkarana*\).1 And they commit the sadhaka to the daily worship of Man-lion, for which there are specific mantras and secret teachings \(*upanishad*\). Many sadhakas appear to remain at this first stage of the path, which may account for the Man-lion shrines found throughout South Asia.

After further training, the sufficiently cleansed refugee may receive the first of a set of three consecrations \(*diksha-traya*\). The first is “Consecration to a Secondary Emanation” \(*vibhava-diksha*\). It contains two parts and qualifies the sadhaka to perform private worship with mantras and icon \(*vibhava*\) solely for his or her own benefit \(*svarthapuja*\). Only priests receive consecrations that qualify them to perform worship for the benefit of others \(*pararthapuja*\). Consecration to vibhava worship appears to have been the most common diksha for those sadhakas, like Pallavamalla, who went beyond the Man-lion Consecration.



#### Vibhava-diksha, Part One

Preparation for this consecration begins with the auspicious sound of a bell \(*ghanta / mani*\) \(*SS* 18.25b\). The acharya employs a mantra to invoke the four formations into himself, purifies himself, and enters a newly constructed hall \(*mandapa*\) and blesses the waiting sadhaka. The acharya, who embodies all four formations, uses mantras to transform the implements for worship into devas. He then invokes the “Mantra of the Pillar of Blazing Light” \(*visakhayupa-mantra*\) to preside throughout the ceremony.2

Many rites follow; the first ones “heat” the sadhaka. Two branding irons are placed in a fire near the acharya; one has the design of a wheel \(*chakra*\) and the other a conch \(*shankha*\), as used today in Pancaratra rites followed by Sri Vaishnavas.3 When they are properly hot the acharya burns away the defilement of the sadhaka’s gross body by branding him or her as God’s property. He burns the wheel onto the right shoulder and the conch onto the left to make the sadhaka God’s property. When dressed according to the prescribed rites, this slave resembles the Master, who likewise bears the wheel on his right and the conch on his left. Ashvaghosha in his first-century “Life of the Buddha” \(*Buddhacharita*\) appears to have referred to these householder sadhakas as “wheel-bearers” \(*chakradhara*\).4 Nandivarman joined their ranks seven centuries later, as Kalikanri tells us in his poem about the rites at the Temple of the Eight-Armed Lord in Attiyur. Nandivarman’s voice wonders whether the acharya is Krishna who slew the elephant Kuvalayapida and lifted the mountain Govardhana, and then comments on the red-hot branding iron of the wheel, which the acharya holds before him:


The elephant feared

The man of wondrous deeds

Who held the great bell of a mountain

High to the clouds against the black rain,

Is he the cowherd

who held its tusk that day?

He recites Veda in front of me

And holds the wheel

Of burning light

Glowing like the light

Of heaven’s justice,

“Who is this person?”

I ask,

“I am the one dwelling in the house

Of the Eight-Armed-Lord”

he says.5


Once branded, the sadhaka is to feel the Bhagavan permeating his or her entire body, worships the Ruler as “supporter” and “supported,” and becomes the abode of devas. The sadhaka’s microcosmic body and Brahma’s macrocosmic bodies have fused. The acharya wraps a red thread around the sadhaka’s body and he or she visualizes bondage by the “passionate thread” of the twenty-five constituents of reality \(*tattvas*\) other than the atman, and the presence within of the four formations and everything else \(*SS* 18.111–199; Smith 1975: 528–529\). The sadhaka now possesses Brahma’s sovereignty \(*aishvarya*\).

This “heating” gives way to a “cooling.” The slave sits in Brahma’s sovereign place and the “oceans” within their respective bodies are now the same ocean of consciousness. The acharya infuses the “milk” of sacred lore and mantras into this ocean to make it the Milk Ocean. This is the way Kalikanri describes this cooling part of Nandivarman’s consecration:


Through the coolness of his nature

He teaches those in heaven and elsewhere

the arts

Veda

books on justice

ceremonies

and the meaning of mantras

Adjusted by grace to their nature,

Like the Ocean of Waves, home to

the tall mountain

the black gem

the Goddess on the Lotus

and the conch,

“Who is this person?”

I ask,

“I am the one dwelling in the house

Of the Eight-Armed-Lord”

he says.


A portion \(*amsha*\) of Vishnu known as Unconquered \(*ajita*\) is now planted at the base of the body as its tortoise-like “supporter” and at the top as the deva-like “supported.” Ajita uses devas and asuras to churn the Milk Ocean and produce the elements of a long and prosperous royal life for the conjoined Brahma and sadhaka. Some go to devas and others to asuras, but Ajita keeps majesty \(*shri*\) and the Kaustubha gem for his self.



#### Vibhava-diksha, Part Two

In the second part of the vibhava-diksha, the sadhaka’s identification with Brahma shifts to identification with Vasudeva and he or she receives the root of all mantras, the eight-syllable *Om namo narayanaya*.6 This second part is also known as the “one-yet-many consecration” \(*ekaneka-diksha*\) because it yields three results depending on the sadhaka’s intent: material enjoyment alone \(*bhoga*\), material enjoyment together with the isolation of the atman known as kaivalya, or only kaivalya. The sadhaka’s formal resolution \(*sankalpa*\) determines which mantras he or she receives, their consequent sadhanas, and the fruits produced \(*SS* 19.123–182; Smith 1975: 530\).

The liturgy of part two begins after the sadhaka has slept, and in the morning the acharya analyzes his or her dreams. He determines the rites appropriate to what the dreams reveal about the sadhaka. For them the sadhaka sits in a drawn mandala infused with the Bhagavan’s presence. The acharya places his hand on the sadhaka’s head, purifies him or her with mantras, and wraps a cloth around the eyes. He has the blindfolded sadhaka offer rites of hospitality \(*arghya*\) to the material form of the eight-syllable mantra \(*mantramurti*\), which is a stalk of kusha or darbha grass \(Smith 1980: 83\).

The acharya modifies the mantra according to the sadhaka’s ritual status and whispers it into the sadhaka’s right ear. The acharya Vedanta Deshika \(born 1268\) says that male members of the twice-born ritual classes \(usually Brahmins in southern India\) receive the root mantra in its Vedic form, with the dative suffix and the syllable *Om: Om namo narayanaya*. But women of the twice-born classes and all Shudras and others receive it in its tantric form without the dative suffix and *Om*: either as *Namo narayana* or *Namo narayanam*. Even though these distinctions are important, they are nevertheless superficial, because, Deshika says, all three versions of the mantra have the same validity and everyone may use the tantric versions. Only the Vedic version is restricted to the twice-born \(Vedanta Deshika 1956: 350–351\).

When the acharya removes the blindfold he shows the sadhaka the mantra’s material form and gives him or her a new name, one of the Bhagavan’s twelve murtis or of his weapons. In the case of a Brahmin male the name should end with *svami* \(master\), of a Kshatriya with *deva*, of a Vaisya with *vardhana* \(thriving\), and of a Shudra with *dasa* \(servant, slave\).7 The newly named sadhaka worships in the manner appropriate to his or her ritual class \(*varna*\), and the acharya performs further mantra rites on his disciple’s behalf \(*SS* 19.1–122; Smith 1975: 529–530\).

The final rite of this portion and of the entire vibhava-diksha is the unction \(*abhisheka*\); it completes the diksha as a “birth.” For this rite the sadhaka sits inside a specially built hall \(*mandapa*\), on a pedestal infused with the presence of the Plower as Adishesha the Snake. While the sadhaka utters the newly received root mantra, the acharya pours water over his head from a jar consecrated with Vishnu’s presence \(*vaishnava-kumbha*\). The poured water transmits Vishnu’s presence onto the sadhaka and signals that he or she is like a newborn cleansed of all defilement \(*papa*\) \(Heesterman 1957:157\). The sadhaka may now use the root mantra in worship on his or her behalf \(*svarthapuja*\).

This infusion of Adishesha in the pedestal on which the sadhaka sits for the unction reveals that part two of the vibhava-diksha moves the sadhaka from identification with Brahma to identification with the Unobstructed as Brahma’s source. The sadhaka’s posture replicates the Unobstructed as he appears in the waters of Vasudeva’s womb beyond directional space and chronological time \(*BP* 10.89.47–57\). When Brahma is awake in his body of spacetime the Unobstructed sits enthroned on the Plower as the snake Adishesha holding our perishing realm \(*kshiti mandala*\) on one of his thousand hoods. It has the size of a mustard seed \(*BP* 5.25.2\). The sadhaka’s ocean of consciousness is no longer the ocean existing inside Brahma, but the ocean in which Brahma exists. The axe of nonclinging in the metaphor of the fig tree has achieved its goal at least momentarily, and unction fluids are poured over the sadhaka repeating the eight-syllable mantra to confirm the fact.

The sadhaka now has a status like that of the seer Nara \(“man”\) and his acharya has a status like that of the seer Narayana. Nara is the material form of Vasudeva as a sadhaka disciple of himself in the material form of the seer named Narayana. God appears to become both guru and disciple in order to provide material forms to illustrate the meaning of the root mantra: “*Om*, I a human \(*nara*\) venerate him in whom I live, and move, and have my being \(*narayana*\).”

Nara venerates Narayana at his ashram at Badari, but throughout the kalpa the pair invisibly traverses Bharata to teach the discipline of the ego in favor of the atman, and to model the acharya-shishya relationship. Bhagavatas worship them together, and the very first words of the *Mahabharata* venerate them, for Narayana appears in its story as Krishna and Nara appears as Arjuna. The deva seer Narada resides at Badari with Narayana and Nara; and in their presence he teaches his disciple, Savarni, the Satvata System and the teachings of the seer Kapila to his mother Devahuti about samkhya and yoga \(*BP* 5.19.9–15; 10.52.1–4; 3.25–32\).

While the sadhaka is still wet from the unction, the acharya leads the “newborn” to the Bhagavan, most likely as icon \(*archa*\). The sadhaka performs the appropriate worship \(*puja*\) with the mantras and rites previously mastered. After this the acharya dismisses devas present in the mandala and its equipment, and the sadhaka worships the acharya, rewards Brahmins and other guests, and eats a meal. The acharya may instruct the “newborn” in the meanings of the root mantra, as Nandivarman’s acharya did at Sri Rangam. He taught the emperor for about two and three-quarters hours \(seven nalikai\), and Kalikanri described his instruction as a mother nursing her newborn child:


Sitting there for seven nalikai,

The breast filled with affection

Oozed with sweet grace

For the enduring Pallava ruler

\(a rare man of true valor,

a patron of kings flaunting

tall glittering crowns\);

I your slave

Know the richness of the mantra

Spoken to him,

I take refuge in the golden feet

That measured the world,

And I am saved by you

My Father at lovely Rangam graced by groves. \(*PT* 5.8.9\)


From this point on the sadhaka is committed to a lifelong sadhana that includes daily use of mudra, mandala, and mantra in worship. Each day he or she is to place the Bhagavan’s protective presence on six places of the body, most visibly on the forehead between the eyebrows \(*SS* 21.48–52a\). Daily life is to center on devotion to fire, to guru, to mantra, to the religious system \(*shastra*\), and to its authorities. And in every act the sadhaka is to remember the acharya \(*SS* 21.62; Smith 1975: 530–531\).



#### The Sadhaka

Let us now consider the sadhaka who has received the vibhava-diksha and is a slave to Majesty united to Ajita as Sri Vishnu or Tirumal. His consciousness has been infused with mantras, and God churns it through sadhana to produce all the elements of his majestic life, framed at its beginning by its end \(*kalakuta*\) and at its end by its prosperous longevity \(*amrita*\). His identities as Indra of Men \(*narendra*\) and Man as Deva \(*naradeva*\) are now subsumed by his status as a *Shrimad-bhagavata*, a Slave of the Bhagavan Possessing Majesty.

He appears in the framing stories of Nrisimha and Hiryanakashipu as a majestic Bhagavata \(Yudhishthira\) facing death \(Parikshit\). The story of Hiryanakashipu depicts a drama within him, which will lead to his death and another birth. Chronologically this story takes place prior to the Milk Ocean churning, and its place in the *Bhagavata Purana* before that story identifies it with the cleansing Man-lion Consecration \(*nrisimha-diksha*\). It is nevertheless depicted on the temple to illustrate the penultimate vyuha-diksha, because this sadhaka is qualified to perform worship to gain worldly pleasure \(*bhoga*\) for his self, like Hiryanakashipu. He understands samkhya’s doctrine of perceptive consciousness \(*purusha*\) as distinct from matter \(*prakriti*\), and he knows the yoga to use to be as wealthy and self-sufficient as Brahma appears to be. At the same time, however, a delight in Krishna has been born in him through the consecration, and it is steadfastly committed to the yoga of the servant \(*dasya-yoga*\) like Prahlada. A mature discipline for gaining one’s own pleasure \(*bhoga*\), and a young discipline for gaining another’s pleasure \(*dasa*\), are irreconcilable realities now exisitng within the same sadhaka. The solution to their opposition is samkhya-yoga as it is taught by the seer Kapila in the *Bhagavata Purana*, because it does not end with bhoga nor with kaivalya or moksha, but with service at Vasudeva’s feet \(*BP* 3.25.32–44\). This is the goal of the penultimate vyuha-diksha.



#### Man-lion in the Ocean of Milk: The Vyuha-diksha

Before Man-lion seized Hiryanakashipu, God’s bala churned the sadhaka’s ocean of consciousness infused with the milk of mantra through the sadhana of the vibhava-diksha. But through the sadhana of the next consecration, the vyuha-diksha, God’s jnana is enthroned within his ocean of milkly consciousness as Man-lion. We know this because of “The Secret Teaching about Man-lion’s Burning” \(*Nrisimha-tapaniya Upanishad*\) of the *Atharva Veda* \(Deussen 1980 2. 809–861\).

The *Nrisimha-tapaniya Upanishad* consists of two parts, the first or prior \(*purva*\) and the second or latter \(*uttara*\). Part one begins by telling us, “The Man-lion who rests in the milk-ocean \[is\] ‘the highest step’ meditated upon by the yogins” \(Purva 1.5\). Man-lion is the “King of Mantras” \(*mantraraja*\) resting on his throne within the sadhaka’s milk-ocean consciousness. It comes from Agama rather than from Veda, and devas receive it when they go to the Master of Progeny seeking refuge from their fear of death in samsara. Any sadhaka may receive it and recite it, but its accompanying Vedic portions such as *Om* are restricted to the twice-born \(Purva 1.3, 1.7\). As Man-lion’s sonic body, the mantra’s audible utterance \(*japa*\) conveys a vision of God and in the Kali Yuga is the gate to liberation \(Purva 1.5\).

The mantra consists of four lines in the anushtubh meter; in Paul Deussen’s translation it reads:


The terrible, mighty, great, Vishnu,

Burning in all the directions,

As Man-lion, fearful and gracious,

As the death of deaths, I adore him.

\(Deussen 1980 2: 810\).


The mantra may be drawn as a wheel mandala with *Om* at the center to denote Man-lion. It may be inscribed on a protective device \(*yantra*\) given by an acharya to a disciple to wear on the neck, arm, or hair-tuft. Its protective potency \(*shakti*\) is believed to be astounding. It produces fruits equivalent to: the purity of devas; release from all sins and samsara; the bondage of all devas, asuras, and poisons; the gain of the seven worlds from earth up to the cosmic shell; the enchantment of all beings; the offering of all sacrifices; the study of all revealed texts; and one hundred learned ascetics reciting the *Atharva Veda*. It confers the abode yogins meditate upon, which they gain and never lose \(Purva 5; Deussen 1980 2: 829–833\).



### ***The Sadhana of the Vyuha-diksha***

The vyuha-diksha inaugurates two sadhanas, which enable delight in Krishna to rule consciousness \(*SS* 16.29a, 36b–37; Smith 1975: 526\). The *Satvata-samhita* of the Pancharatra Agama describes them. The first sadhana consists of rites entitled “Worship of the Formations in the Fourth State of Consciousness” \(*turiyavyuha-samaradhana*\). They employ mantras and materials to produce a wheel of colors and letters \(*vamachakra*\), which the sadhaka draws on a surface, placing letters of the Sanskrit script in the spaces between wheel’s spokes, along the rim, and elsewhere.8 The sadhaka uses the wheel to focus on the four formations in his deep-sleep consciousness \(*sushupti-vyuha*\) and to worship them with four mantras.9

During the second discipline he constructs mantras from the same wheel of colors and letters for further worship. First he creates the Mantra of the Pillar of Blazing Light \(*vishakhayupa-mantra*\) from twenty-four letters and uses it to address all four of Narayana’s formations at once. He then uses four other mantras to address each formation individually, envisioning them as existing in his dreaming-sleep consciousness \(*svapnavyuha*\).10

Part two of the upanishad identifies the mantra *Om* at the mandala’s center as Man-lion, and says *Om* is the subject of its entire teaching \(Deussen 1980 2: 837–858\). According to Paul Deussen, *Om* unifies the microcosmic atman and the macrocosmic *brahman*, and Man-lion embodies all three. Its concept of the atman is subtler than samkhya’s separation of Self from matter in kaivalya. In Deussen’s words, “\[the atman\] persists in full purity only in his supreme, sixteenth aspect as a completely passive subject of perception \(*avikalpa*\), while with his fifteen subordinate forms he projects into the world and conditions its reality, but … this whole reality of the world and his fifteen subordinate forms are nothing when looked at from the highest point of view. The inner unity of Atman in all beings is thereby brought to view by the artistically executed interweaving of all forms with each other” \(Deussen 1980 2: 835\). Consciousness awake, dreaming, or in dreamless sleep participates in the deeper stage called the fourth \(*turiya*\). But the fourth itself divides into four. The “fourth of this fourth” \(*turiyaturiya*\) is the sixteenth and supreme aspect of the pure atman, completely true being without difference \(*avikalpa*\), pure perception whose only taste is of mental activity. It is not discovered through intellectual activity, however, only through conscious experience \(*anubhava*\).11 This conscious experience of the fourth of the fourth results from the two sadhanas inaugurated by the vyuha-diksha.



#### The Sukshma-diksha

As the last of the three consecrations that Narada teaches in the *Satvata-samhita*, the sukshma-diksha or “Consecration to the Hidden,” addresses the formations perceived in waking consciousness \(*SS* 5–6; Smith 1975: 517–520\). It moves the sadhaka’s perception of God from dreaming sleep to the per-eception of Narayana’s four formations while awake \(*jagratvyuha*\). Akrura’s underwater perception of Krishna and Balarama sitting in his chariot as Narayana sitting on Samkashana, and his long prayer, illustrate the hidden nature of this perception, as discussed in chapter 6. As Krishna told Arjuna, it is a waking up to a joy that culminates in “extinguishing in *brahman*” \(*brahmanirvana*\). “His pleasure within, his joy within, his light within, he with consciousness unified becomes *brahman* and approaches extinguishing in *brahman*. Seers in whom kalmasha is destroyed attain extinguishing in *brahman:* their doubts dispelled, with self-control, they take pleasure in friendliness toward all beings.12 Extinguishing in *brahman* revolves on all sides of these yatis whose thoughts are controlled, who are unlinked from desire and anger, and who know the Self”13

This sadhana begins with an interior sacrifice \(*antaryaga*\), performed with faith \(*shraddha*\) and devotion \(*bhakti*\) and using the wheel. The sadhaka visually constructs the formations with their specific shapes and colors, and then dissolves them counterclockwise, from the Unobstructed back through the Pre-eminently Mighty to the Plower and finally to Vasudeva, Lord of the Moving Universe. This rite is called apyayayoga, “the unification of consciousness \(*yoga*\) by dissolving \(*apyaya*\),” or “dissolving into unity” \(*SS* 5.21–26\). The singular Vasudeva at the end is the singular Krishna depicted in Panel 10, for Kaliya’s wives identify Krishna dancing on their husband as embodying all four formations. Balarama’s intentional inactivity in the Kaliya episode matches this apyayayoga, because Govinda acts on his own.

After this interior sacrifice, the Sukshma-diksha prescribes an exterior sacrifice \(*bahiryaga*\) to the “fourfold atman” \(*chaturatmya*\). It takes two forms. One is an elaborate puja focused on an icon in the Bhagavan’s house \(*bhagavadgriha*\) \(*SS* 6.1–131; Smith 1975: 518–519\). The other is the worship of the four formations in three stages. The sadhaka first takes fire out of a single pit to establish four separate fires, one for each formation. He offers each vyuha the offerings appropriate to him in his own fire. The sadhaka then performs ancestral rites by selecting four Pancharatra Brahmins whom he visualizes as the formations. Finally, the sadhaka visualizes the formations as inside his self and sacrifices to them \(*atmayaga*\). After all of this, he prostrates at the feet of God in the Bhagavan’s house and recites scriptures \(*SS* 6.132–190; Smith 1975: 519–520\).

Both forms of the exterior sacrifice \(*bahiryaga*\) correspond in the story to Krishna’s emergence from the Yamana River pond dressed as if for puja. The Brahmins who come to receive gifts correspond to the four Brahmins the sadhaka worships as the four formations, for they, too, receive gifts. Yashoda with Krishna sitting on her lap corresponds to the sadhaka’s worship of the formations inside himself. This last correspondence, however, requires a brief discussion of Yashoda and Nanda as they apply to the sadhaka.

According to the narrating Shuka, after Krishna emerged from the encounter with Kaliya, Yashoda of great excellence \(*mahabhaga*\), the sati who got back her lost child, embraced Krishna, placed him on her lap, and wept with joy. Yashoda represents the sadhaka’s knowledge \(*jnana*\), the greatest excellence \(*bhaga*\) a soul \(*jiva*\) possesses. This knowledge appears as a woman of true being \(*sati*\) joyfully embracing Krishna as its object. Correspondingly, Nanda represents the power \(*bala*\) paired with it. But the soul’s bhagas are limited in contrast to the bhagas of God. Nanda tries to go into the pool after Krishna disappears into Kaliya’s coils, but God’s bala, Balarama, restrains him \(*BP* 10.16.22\). Yashoda as the soul’s jnana holds the bejeweled Krishna in her lap, but her knowledge remains defective, because Krishna is not her son \(*BP* 10.17.17–18\).
