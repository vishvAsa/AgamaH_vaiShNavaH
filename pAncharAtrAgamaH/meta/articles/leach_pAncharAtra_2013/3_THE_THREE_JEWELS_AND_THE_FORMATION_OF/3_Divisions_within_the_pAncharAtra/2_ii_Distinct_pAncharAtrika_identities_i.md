title = "2 ii \\) Distinct Pāñcarātrika identities in the Āgamaprāmāṇya"

+++

It is clear that in his *Āgamaprāmāṇya* \(ĀP\) Yāmuna distinguishes between several types of Bhāgavata or ‘Sātvata’/’Sāttvata’ \(both spellings are used, the former more commonly\) who accept the authority of the Pāñcarātra scriptures.[^78] The unsystematic manner in which these distinctions are made, however, means that the identity of each distinguishable “type” is not altogether obvious. Perhaps unsurprisingly, modern scholars have arrived at different interpretations with regard to precisely which distinct groups are recognised by Yāmuna. Neevel \(1977: 30-37\) contends that the ĀP distinguishes between four classes of Bhāgavata which he names as: 

- \(i\) temple servants;  
- \(ii\) professional temple priests \( *arcaka*\);  
- \(iii\) Bhāgavata Brahmins who perform worship only for themselves, and who additionally perform “a distinctive series of forty sacraments \( *saṃskāra* s\)… based upon the now lost but inferable Ekāyana Śākhā” \(ibid.: 33\); and 
- \(iv\) Bhāgavata Brahmins who perform both Pāñcarātra and Vedic rites.
  
Rastelli \(2006\) and Young \(2007\) concur that there are four distinct groups represented by Yāmuna, though each differ in their interpretations as to the identity of these groups. 

The first of Neevel’s four “classes”, that of the “temple servants”, is described quite clearly in the ĀP \(150.4 *ff*\). Members of this class, called *vaiśyavrātya* s by Yāmuna’s Mīmāṃsaka opponents,[^79] are uninitiated \(and therefore ineligible for worshipping the Bhagavat directly\) and are classed as ‘Bhāgavatas’ purely on account of their association, as servants and temple guards \( *prāsādapālaka*\), with the temple worship of Vāsudeva. Contra Rastelli, Young \(2007: 241-242 n. 189\) argues that members of Neevel’s second class, the “professional temple priests” who earn a living by performing sacrifices or worship for others, are one branch of the group of 78 In this work the terms ‘Bhāgavata’ and ‘Sātvata’ are usually synonymous, the notable exception to the rule being Yāmuna’s Mīmāṃsaka opponent’s reference to “the threefold doctrine \( *tridhā matam*\) – 

Bhākta, Bhāgavata and Sātvata” at ĀP 54.3. When Yāmuna speaks “in his own voice” as it were, he treats both names as designating the same group - see for example ĀP 148.11, and 155.1-4. That both terms refer also to the ‘Pañcarātra’ can be inferred from ĀP 1.7-2.4 where Bhāgavata “doctrine” \( *matam*\) and “Pañcarātra *tantra*” are used interchangeably, and ĀP 7.1-2 and 170.13-171.4 where ‘Sātvata’ and ‘Pañcarātra’ are coterminous. 

[^79]: A *vaiśyavrātya* is one who has lost his status as a member of the Vaiśya class as a consequence of neglecting his Vaiśya duties. Manu \(10.23\) lists the Sātvatas among the offspring of *vaiśyavrātya* s. [[63]]

Bhāgavata Brahmins whom Neevel distinguishes as his *fourth* class i.e. those that perform both Pāñcarātra and Vedic rites. This branch of Bhāgavata Brahmins are a class of professional priests, says Young, who belong to the Vājasaneyaśākhā. There also exists, according to Young’s reading of the ĀP, another branch of Bhāgavata Brahmins belonging to the Vājasaneyaśākhā who perform *pūjā* only for themselves. 

These represent Young’s third group. Her fourth consists of Ekāyanas who claim membership of a lost Vedic recension \( *śākhā*\), and who “have some temple involvement.” 

Rastelli’s \(2006: 219\) interpretation of Yāmuna’s account is different again. Like Neevel, she distinguishes between the professional temple priests who have undergone *dīkṣā* and the Vājasaneyaśākhā Bhāgavata Brahmins who perform both Pāñcarātra and Vedic rites. Unlike Neevel, however, she does not interpret the ĀP as limiting members of the Ekāyanaśākhā to the performance of *svārthapūjā*, or “worship for oneself”, i.e. the form of worship “whose fruit goes to the worshipper” \(Brunner 1990: 6\). And unlike Young, Rastelli does not identify either the *svārthapūjaka* s or those who perform rituals for others \(i.e. the professional temple priests who are called *parārthapūjaka*\) solely with members of the Vājasaneyaśākhā. 

On my own reading of the ĀP, Yāmuna clearly distinguishes between different types of Bhāgavata on three separate occasions. In the first instance, he distinguishes between the temple servants and the Bhāgavatas by whom “the group of actions are performed daily: “approaching” the god \( *abhigamana*\), the gathering of the materials for worship \( *upādāna*\), worship \(literally “offering”, *ijyā*\), the study of texts \( *svādhyāya*\), and meditation \( *yoga*\)” \(ĀP 151.1-2\). The Bhāgavatas who perform these daily duties connected with the five times \( *pañcakāla*\) are the Pāñcarātrika Brahmins who are the subject of Yāmuna’s defence in the ĀP. These are then themselves subdivided by Yāmuna \(at ĀP 154.11-155.2\) into those who worship Hari for their profession \( *vṛtti*\) and those who perform *pūjā* only for themselves \( *svārtha*\). 

Then, at the end of the ĀP \(169.3 *ff*\), Yāmuna again subdivides the *pañcakālika* Brahmins into those who follow the Vājasaneyaśākhā, and those who have abandoned 64 

the *dharma* of the triple Veda \( *trayīdharma*\), and who perform the forty sacraments \( *saṃskāra*\) enjoined by the Ekāyanaśruti.80 

Whilst the aforementioned scholars are surely right to highlight the “categorical” 

distinction between the professional temple priests and those who perform rituals only for themselves, I am hesitant in accepting Young’s proposal that Yāmuna represents both of these “groups” as belonging solely to the Vājasaneyaśākhā. Although there are certain passages within the Pāñcarātra Saṃhitās which would support identifying Yāmuna’s professional priests as Vājasaneyins,81 there also exist passages which should warn *against* any such easy identification.82 These ambiguities can possibly be ironed out with recourse to the chronology of the relevant literature, and also can be explained by the fact that we are clearly dealing with both “internal” and “external” 

descriptions among distinct Pāñcarātra traditions. We should hardly expect, for example, that a description of the Vājasaneyaśākhā by an “external” Ekāyana author will completely coincide with an “internal” Vājasaneya *self*-description. However, more pertinent to my present purposes, irrespective of what is found in the broader Pāñcarātra literature, I can find no unequivocal suggestion in the ĀP that the professional priests belong only to the Vājasaneyaśākhā. Indeed, beyond claiming that the professional priests he is defending are initiated Bhāgavata Brahmins \(ĀP 154-158\) whose “meagre livelihoods” \( *vṛttikarśitāḥ*\) lead them to “perform sacrifices professionally for eminent Vaiṣṇavas” \(ĀP 155.3-4\), Yāmuna gives no information 80 That followers of the Ekāyanaśākhā perform the *pañcakālika* rites is asserted at ĀP 170.3-6. Young \(2007: 238-239\) interprets ‘Ekāyana’ in this instance as denoting a “general orientation”, synonymous with the terms Bhāgavata and Pāñcarātra. I do not agree with this reading, but even if it is correct it would still mean that Yāmuna is including the Ekāyanas \(i.e. as genuine Bhāgavatas\) among the *pañcakālika* Bhāgavatas. It might be added that in the Pāñcarātra scriptural literature, followers of both the Ekāyanaśākhā \(see PārS 1.44ab; 9.48b; 10.252c, 287b-289; and the *Bhārgavatantra* 24.19\) and the Vājasaneyaśākhā \(see PādS *cp* 21.13\) are said to perform the *pañcakāla* rites. 

[^81]: Yāmuna claims \(ĀP 156.6-158.3\) that the professional temple priests in question have undergone the Pāñcarātrika sacrament of initiation \( *dīkṣāsaṃskāra*\). In certain Pāñcarātra Saṃhitās \(see Rastelli 2006: 193-195\), though pointedly not in the ĀP, it is quite clearly stated that followers of the Ekāyanaśākhā 

do *not* undergo *dīkṣā*. In addition, elsewhere in the Pāñcarātra scriptural literature \(see, for instance, PādS *cp* 21.17c-21b\) it is claimed that only Mantrasiddhāntins \(viz. followers of the Vājasaneyaśākhā\) are qualified to perform rituals “for the sake of others” \( *parārtha*\). 

[^82]: See, for instance, PādS *cp* 1.3-9; PārS 9.152-153b: *iti svārthāvirodhena parārthādhikṛtasya tu* / 

*ekāyanasya viduṣaḥ proktāḥ kālāḥ krameṇa tu* // * tathā vai dīkṣitasyāpi siddhāntaratacetasaḥ* /; and also ĪS 21.511-512b: *svārthasyāpi parārthasya pūjāyām adhikāriṇaḥ*/ *śāṇḍilyādyanvaye jātā guror labdhābhiṣecanāḥ*// *anye tu kevalaṃ svārthapūjane hy adhikāriṇaḥ*/. The following section \(ĪS 

21.513-558\) unambiguously locates the “lineage of Śāṇḍilya etc.” within the tradition of the Ekāyanaveda. [[65]]

whatsoever as to their identity.83 Further to this, I can see no suggestion, in either the ĀP or the Pāñcarātra Saṃhitās, that those Bhāgavatas who Yāmuna claims “perform *pūjā* \[only\] for themselves” should be thought of as belonging only to the Vājasaneyaśākhā. Having asserted that there are Bhāgavatas who perform *pūjā* only for themselves at ĀP 155.2, Yāmuna then goes on to defend the professional priests, saying nothing more of the former group. When distinctions between the two *śākhā* s are admitted at ĀP 169.3 *ff*, Yāmuna mentions neither *parārthapūjā* nor *svārthapūjā*. It should, for the sake of clarity, be added here that the *pañcakālika* rites, performed by members of both recensions, are *svārthapūjā*. ****

I have dwelt on these issues because I think that to interpret Yāmuna as distinguishing between the Vājasaneyaśākhā and the Ekāyanaśākhā in such an explicit manner is to overlook the significant fact that it is only at the very end of the ĀP \(at 169.3 *ff*\), in other words at a stage in the debate when the author is confident that his opponents have already been defeated, that he concedes for the first time that there are differences in the ritual practices adopted by the followers of the two *śākhā* s. Until this point, although he has divided the *pañcakālika* Brahmins into *parārthapūjaka* s and *svārthapūjaka* s, Yāmuna has presented the Pāñcarātra as very much a single and homogeneous ritualistic tradition. Thus we find references, for example, to “the path prescribed by the Pañcarātra system” \( *pañcarātratantravihitamārgeṇa*, ĀP 139.6\), and to 

“the 

sacrament 

of 

initiation 

established 

by 

the 

Pañcarātra” 

\( *pañcarātrasiddhadīkṣāsaṃskāra*, ĀP 158.1\). Other than at ĀP 88.5 *ff*, where the Ekāyanaśākhā is said to be in conformity with the Veda, each of the *śākhā* s are mentioned only twice by Yāmuna prior to ĀP 169.3, and on both occasions it is their commonality, rather than their differences, that are highlighted. The passages in question read as follows: 

[^83]: Although at ĀP 169-170 the author distinguishes between the ritual practices of the Vājasaneyins and the Ekāyanas, he says nothing here which should exclude the Ekāyanas from acting as professional priests. It is true that at ĀP 170.6 the Ekāyanas are characterised as *mumukṣu* s, but this need not disqualify them - on this point see e.g. ĪS 21.506-508 and, more generally, Brunner \(1990\), who provides a clear account of the distinctions between *svārtha- * and *parārthapūjā*. The same would apply of course if we accept Young’s \(2007: 238-239\) reading that ‘Ekāyana’ here denotes ‘Bhāgavata’ in general \(and elsewhere, at ĀP 91.1-6, Yāmuna *does* imply that the Pāñcarātra tradition *in toto* is concerned only with *mokṣa*\). [[66]]

*atha bhāgavatajanaparigṛhītatvād iti hetuḥ hanta tarhi tatparigṛhītatvād vājasaneyakaikāyanaśākhāvacasāṃ pratyakṣādīnāṃ cāprāmāṇyaprasaṅgaḥ*/. - 

“Moreover, as to the argument \[that the Pañcarātra is invalid\] “because it is accepted by the Bhāgavatas”, well in that case the \[scriptural\] statements of the Vājasaneyaka and Ekāyana *śākhā* s and \[the means of knowledge\] perception etc. 

are also invalid, because they are accepted \[by the Bhāgavatas\] too\!” \(ĀP 140.5-7\) 

*iha vā kim aharahar adhīyamānavājasaneyakaikāyanaśākhān vilasadupa-vītottarīyaśikhāśālino ’dhyāpayato yājayataḥ pratigṛhṇato viduṣaḥ paśyanto brāhmaṇā iti nāvayanti*/. – “And in this case also, when \[people\] see learned men who study the Vājasaneyaka and Ekāyana *śākhā* s daily, who wear their clearly visible sacred threads, upper garments and hair-tufts, who teach and sacrifice and accept gifts, do they not consider them to be Brahmins? \(ĀP 141.8-10\) 

If it is reasonable to interpret these representations of the Vājasaneya and Ekāyana *śākhās* as being deliberately general or, as it were, “non-sectarian”, we might also see evidence of this generalising tendency in Yāmuna’s presentation of ‘Sātvata’, ‘Pañcarātra’, and ‘Bhāgavata’ as synonymous terms. As Colas \(2003: 234, 239\) has demonstrated, in much of the earlier literature that is external \(like the ĀP\) to the Pāñcarātra scriptural corpus, the terms ‘Bhāgavata’ and ‘Pañcarātra’ in particular refer to distinguishable groups.84 

<details><summary>Separation</summary>

This is the case in such diverse texts as Bāṇa’s *Harṣacarita* \(a seventh century work, the eighth chapter of which clearly presents Bhāgavatas and Pāñcarātrikas as distinct groups\), a ninth century Cambodian stele inscription at Prasat Komnap \(K. 701, wherein ‘Bhāgavata’, ‘Pañcarātra’, and ‘Sāttvata’ are named as three Vaiṣṇava denominations\), and a number of *circa* tenth century Vaikhānasa texts \(wherein ‘Bhāgavatas’ and ‘Pāñcarātrikas’ are clearly set apart\). This information is from Colas \(2003\). As Bakker \(1997\) and Willis \(2009\) have argued, the Sātvatas were themselves very likely a “strand” within a broader Bhāgavata cult, which points to the fact that the designation ‘Bhāgavata’ functioned as a general, overarching term as well as a specific one. 
</details>


A notable exception here is provided by Bhaṭṭa Jayanta’s *Āgamaḍambara *\(ĀḌ\), written in Kashmir during the reign of Śaṅkaravarman \(i.e. 883-902 CE\). In this play, which also endeavours to defend the orthodoxy of the Pāñcarātra, ‘Bhāgavata’ \(ĀḌ 4.11\), ‘Sātvata’ \(ĀḌ 4.19\) and ‘Pāñcarātrika’ \(ĀḌ 4.25\) are all used interchangeably to refer to the same religious group \(Dezső 2005: 197, 203\). 

I do not need to repeat here in detail the arguments of Colas \(ibid.\) and a number of other scholars \(e.g. Inden 2000\) – namely, that the term ‘Bhāgavata’ referred, at least during the period of the 5th - 6th centuries, primarily to “householder” or to [[67]]“aristocratic” Vaiṣṇavas who adhered to the Vedic sacrificial liturgy and were thus distinct from followers of the Pāñcarātra tradition which, as depicted in the early \(c. fourth-fifth century CE\)85 Vaiṣṇava text the *Nārāyaṇīya*, tended to, in the words of Colas \(2003: 234\), “subordinate Vedic rituals to its own renunciative ideology”. If we concur with Inden’s \(2000: 66\) reading of the *Viṣṇudharmottarapurāṇa* \(VDhP\), we might consider this work as perhaps one of the earliest extant texts to provide a precedent for Yāmuna’s strategy of collapsing the traditional distinctions between ‘Pāñcarātrika’ and ‘Bhāgavata’. However the dating of the VDhP is notoriously difficult.86 

Turning to the early Pāñcarātra Saṃhitās themselves, the Bhāgavatas are barely mentioned at all in the JS, SS and PauṣS.87 However, two later works which are quoted by Yāmuna in his ĀP, namely the *Paramasaṃhitā *\(ParS\) and the SanS, do employ the designation ‘Bhāgavata’ to refer to followers of the Pāñcarātra. In the case of the ParS, the majority of the passages in which the term ‘Bhāgavata’ is used to denote ‘Pāñcarātrika’ belong to sections of the text which Czerniak-Drożdżowicz \(2003\) has identified as having been inserted or “re-worked” by a later redactor.88 

However, in several instances, portions which apparently belong to the older “ritualistic corpus” also contain this use of the term ‘Bhāgavata’.89 Meanwhile the 85 See Schreiner \(1997a: 1\) for these dates. According to Oberlies \(1997: 86\), the oldest sections of the *Nārāyaṇīya* \(chapters 321-326\) most likely belong to the period 200-300 CE. Hiltebeitel \(2006\), it should be noted, rejects these arguments and favours substantially earlier dates for the *Nārāyaṇīya*, and indeed the MBh as a whole. 

[^86]: See for example Shah \(1958\), Rocher \(1986\), and Lubotsky \(1996\). Both Kane \(1962\) and Inden \(2000\) put forward the conservative dates 600-1000 CE. 

[^87]: The term *bhāgavata* occurs three times in the PauṣS, at 8.136, 36.409, and 38.42, though there is no indication in any of these passages that it should be taken as synonymous with Pāñcarātrika. The term appears once in the JS in the verse-heading at 22.3, where the five kinds of Vaiṣṇava – Yati, Ekāntin, Vaikhānasa, Karmasāttvata and Śikhin – are referred to as those who are “exclusively devoted to the Bhāgavata *dharma*”, and it does not occur at all in the SS. 

[^88]: Interpolated passages which equate ‘Bhāgavata’ with ‘Pāñcarātrika’ include ParS 3.36, 38, 57, 69-70; 27.30; 30.71, 123. It is very difficult to say when these and other similar passages were added to the ParS. 

[^89]: The most striking of these is at ParS 4.57-58: *etad vīravidhir hy eṣaḥ saṃkṣepāt kathito mayā*/ 

*iṣṭvaiva paramātmānaṃ nityaṃ bhāgavataś śuciḥ*// *sarvapāpaviśuddhātmā muktimārgaṃ prapadyate*

/ *labhate cepsitān kāmān ihāmutra ca sarvaśaḥ*//. See also ParS 18.30, 19.53 and 25.23. [[68]]

SanS unambiguously equates Bhāgavatas with Sāttvatas, Vaiṣṇavas *and* Pāñcarātrikas.90 

Why, specifically, should Yāmuna seek to present the designations ‘Pañcarātra’ and ‘Bhāgavata’ as synonymous? And why should the success of his defence of the Pāñcarātra be facilitated by his description of it as a single, homogeneous ritualistic tradition? To answer these questions it is helpful to look at the *Pādmasaṃhitā*, a text which was composed in South India some time after the ĀP.91
