  <p>Before turning to the classifications of different Pāñcarātra groups contained in several South Indian works belonging to the same religious context as the tradition of the supremacy of the *Jayākhyasaṃhitā *(JS), *Sātvatasaṃhitā *(SS) and <em>Pauskarasaṃhitā</em> (PauṣS), it will be helpful here to summarise the additional textual evidence for there being distinct types of Pāñcarātrika.</p>
<p>There are, from a period prior to our earliest Pāñcarātra scriptures, a number of textual sources which differentiate between Pāñcarātrikas and Bhāgavatas. I will refer to some of these below when I discuss Yāmuna’s <em>Āgamaprāmāṇya</em>.</p>
<h2 id="shankara">shankara</h2>
<p>Before that, however, it is worth looking at one such source, namely Śaṅkara’s <em>Brahmasūtrabhāṣya</em> (BSBh), in a little more detail. In his comments on <em>sūtra</em> s 2.2.42 and 2.2.44, Śaṅkara appears to attribute different theological positions to the Bhāgavatas and “those who follow the teachings of the Pañcarātra” ( <em>pañcarātrasiddhāntin</em>). The position of the Bhāgavatas is described as follows:</p>
<p><em>bhagavān evaiko vāsudevo nirañjanajñānasvarūpaḥ paramārthatattvam; sa caturdhātmānaṃ pravibhajya pratiṣṭhitaḥ</em>  <em>–</em> <em>vāsudevavyūharūpeṇa,</em> <em>saṃkarṣaṇavyūharūpeṇa, pradyumnavyūharūpeṇa, aniruddhavyūharūpeṇa ca; vāsudevo nāma paramātmā ucyate; saṃkarṣaṇo nāma jīvaḥ; pradyumno nāma manaḥ; aniruddho nāma ahaṃkāraḥ; teṣāṃ vāsudevaḥ parā prakṛtiḥ, itare saṃkarṣaṇādayaḥ kāryam; tam itthaṃbhūtaṃ parameśvaraṃ bhagavantam abhigamanopādānejyāsvādhyāyayogair</em> <em>varṣaśatam iṣṭvā</em> <em>kṣīṇakleśo</em> <em>bhagavantam eva pratipadyata iti</em>/. –</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The unique Bhagavat, Vāsudeva, whose essence is pure knowledge, is the supreme reality. After dividing himself, he is possessed of a fourfold form: the form[s] ( <em>vyūha</em>) Vāsudeva, Saṃkarṣaṇa, Pradyumna and Aniruddha. It is said that the Supreme Self is called Vāsudeva, the individual self is called Saṃkarṣaṇa, the mind is called Pradyumna, and the act of self-formulation is called Aniruddha.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Of these, Vāsudeva is the supreme material cause ( <em>prakṛti</em>), and the others, Saṃkarṣaṇa and so on, are the effect. After worshipping the Bhagavat, the supreme Lord, who is of such a nature [as described here] for a thousand years by means of [the five rites] approaching god, gathering the materials for worship, worship, textual study and meditation, [one’s] pain will be diminished, and one will assuredly attain to the Bhagavat.” (BSBh 415.5-13)</p></blockquote>
<p>The scheme outlined here, with the <em>jīva</em>, *manas * and <em>ahaṃkāra</em> personified by, respectively, Saṃkarṣaṇa, Pradyumna and Aniruddha, is the same as that given in a passage of the <em>Nārāyaṇīya</em> section of the <em>Mahābhārata</em> (MBh 12.326.20-39).</p>
<p>Śaṅkara attributes it here to the Bhāgavatas, and in his commentary on 2.2.44, he suggests that those who follow the teachings of the Pañcarātra do not subscribe to this theory:</p>

<p>“And these [Vyūhas] Saṃkarṣaṇa and so on, are not thought of as really being the individual self etc. How [is it they are thought of] then? It is agreed that all these are lords, [who are] endowed with the lordly properties [omniscient] knowledge, sovereignty, power, strength, virility and splendour. They are all Vāsudevas, flawless, without substrate (i.e. cause?), and with no imperfections… /… / And it is agreed upon by those who follow the teachings of the Pañcarātra that there is no distinction between Vāsudeva and the others, all of whom are identical, [and that none] is created either by the hierarchy [of the properties, omniscient] knowledge and sovereignty etc. Indeed, all the Vyūhas are accepted as Vāsudevas without any distinctions.” (BSBh 416.17-417.2, … 417.15-18)</p></blockquote>
<p>What are we to make of these passages? Some scholars (e.g. Colas 2011: 297) believe that Śaṅkara is using the names ‘Bhāgavata’ and ‘Pañcarātrasiddhāntin’ to refer to the same group. This position is perhaps based on the fact that the Bhāgavatas are described here as worshipping god in accordance with the “five times” (i.e.<em>abhigamana</em> etc.), a practice which is elsewhere expressly associated with the psychological principle.</p>
<p>As van Buitenen shows, the creative function of the <em>ahaṃkāra</em> in the <em>Mokṣadharmaparvan</em> (as well as in the <em>Sāṃkhyakārikā</em>) is continuous with older, mythical narratives wherein the primordial being combines and unites the principles of self-consciousness, self-formulation ( <em>ahaṃkāra</em>, i.e. the exclamation *aham! *), and self- (and by extension, world-) creation. [[48]]</p>
<p>Pāñcarātra.57</p>
<p>But this interpretation has the problem of explaining why it is, then, that the doctrines linked with these denominations are so clearly different. For the Bhāgavatas hold, according to Śaṅkara, that the Vyūhas Saṃkarṣaṇa, Pradyumna and Aniruddha are caused to become manifest by Vāsudeva, the “supreme cause” ( <em>parā prakṛtih</em>). This idea is compatible with the scheme of the successive emergence of these deities, and the principles ( <em>jīva</em>, <em>manas</em>, <em>ahaṃkāra</em>) they personify, that is articulated  in the <em>Nārāyaṇīya</em>.  However,  according  to  Śaṅkara,  the Pañcarātrasiddhāntins reject this idea, and hold that there is no distinction whatsoever between the four Vyūhas. In the absence of any further textual support, it is difficult to arrive at any firm conclusions from the above passages.+++(4)+++ But at the least we can affirm that, in Śaṅkara’s time, there appear to have been doctrinal disagreements among Vaiṣṇavas who adhered to the theology of the four differentiated forms of god ( <em>vyūha</em>).</p>
<p>That there were philosophical disagreements among Pāñcarātrikas, and that these disagreements were relatively important in shaping distinct Pāñcarātrika identities is suggested elsewhere in medieval Sanskrit literature.</p>

<p>In two recent publications, Alexis Sanderson (2007, 2009a) has drawn attention to several references to the ‘Pañcarātra’ tradition in Kashmirian works dating from the final centuries of the first millennium CE.58</p>
<h3 id="haravijaya">Haravijaya</h3>
<p>For the present purposes, two of these works are of particular interest. The first is the <em>Haravijaya</em>, a Sanskrit court epic written by Rājānaka Ratnākara around 830 CE.</p>
<p>In the 47th canto ( <em>sarga</em>) of this work, during a hymn to the goddess Caṇḍī, two groups of Vaiṣṇavas are distinguished (at verses 55-56):</p>
<ul>
<li>the Ekāyanas, whom I will discuss below,</li>
<li>and the followers of the teaching relating to Saṃkarṣaṇa ( <em>sāṃkarṣaṇa śāsana</em>).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="nareśvaraparīkṣāprakāśa">Nareśvaraparīkṣāprakāśa</h3>
<p>The second work, which is considerably more informative, is Bhaṭṭa Rāmakaṇṭha’s <em>Nareśvaraparīkṣāprakāśa</em> (NPP), a philosophical commentary on the c. seventh-eighth century <em>Nareśvaraparīkṣā</em> of Sadyojyotis. The NPP was most probably written during the second half of the tenth century (Watson 2006). Here, two kinds of 57 See e.g. MBh 12.325.4/57-59, the seventh century stele inscription from Baset in Cambodia (K. 447, see Cœdès 1942: 193-95), and a Śaiva work called the <em>Śrīkaṇṭhī</em> or the <em>Śrīkaṇṭhīyasaṃhitā</em>, at verses 51c-52 (Hanneder 1998: 244).</p>
<p>Pāñcarātras are named: the ‘Sāṅkarṣaṇapāñcarātras’ and the ‘Saṃhitāpāñcarātras’.</p>
<p>Sanderson (2009a: 108) thinks it very likely that these are the same groups distinguished by Ratnākara – in other words that the Saṃhitāpāñcarātras, presumably those who follow the Pāñcarātra Saṃhitās, are the same group as the Ekāyanas.</p>
<p>The two groups differ from each other, according to Rāmakaṇṭha, in their views on the individual self ( <em>jīva</em>).</p>
<ul>
<li>On the one hand, the Sāṅkarṣaṇapāñcarātras say that consciousness is merely a product of the “internal organ” ( <em>antaḥkaraṇacaitanikāḥ</em>, NPP 87.22), by which is meant, presumably, the mental faculties <em>manas</em>, <em>buddhi</em> and <em>ahaṃkāra</em>.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></li>
<li>On the other, the Saṃhitāpāñcarātras, along with “the knowers of the Upaniṣads” who subscribe to the theory of the transformation of the original cause, say the following: “Individual selves are truly distinct [from the mental faculties] but they are non-pervasive (i.e. atomic), and they originate from the imperishable supreme cause, which is either the referent of the word <em>brahman</em> [for those who are learned in the Upaniṣads], or is called Nārāyaṇa [for the Saṃhitāpāñcarātras]. Like a pot, for example, [originates from clay and will eventually dissolve back into it, so] the independent natures [of individual selves] originate from and [will eventually] dissolve back into their own cause.”<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>In a later passage, Rāmakaṇṭha says that for those who know the Upaniṣads, and for Pāñcarātras (presumably he is referring to both types of ‘Pāñcarātra’ here), liberation ( <em>mukti</em>) is the absorption of the individual selves into <em>brahman</em> (for the former), and into the supreme material cause ( <em>prakṛti</em>) called Nārāyaṇa (for the latter).<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>
<p>Rāmakaṇṭha’s distinction between the Sāṅkarṣaṇapāñcarātras and the Saṃhitāpāñcarātras offers an intriguing glimpse into an episode in the history of the Pāñcarātra which is now almost completely lost to us.</p>
<p>That distinct groups within the Pāñcarātra should have held opposing views on the ontology of individual selves seems somewhat surprising given that in the Pāñcarātra literature that is currently available, such concerns do not figure prominently.</p>
<h2 id="non-doctrinal-emphasis">Non-doctrinal emphasis</h2>
<p>Moreover, in the works by the Vedāntin defenders of Pāñcarātra orthodoxy, in the Vaikhānasa literature<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> and, as we will see presently, in the Pāñcarātra scriptures, different types of Pāñcarātrika are distinguished from one another not on account of opposing philosophical positions, but rather because of such factors as their different religious goals, liturgical practices, social class ( <em>varṇa</em>), customs, everyday habits, and religious insignia.</p>
<p>In the Pāñcarātra works, there are several ways in which different types of worshipper are classified. Already in our earliest Saṃhitās, there are clear indications that important differences were recognised among devotees, and that one of the most basic distinctions, as attested to in the SS and the PauṣS, was that between those “with desires” ( <em>sakāma</em>) and those “without desires” ( <em>akāma</em>, <em>niṣkāma</em>). The former, inevitably, desire various mundane and heavenly rewards (see e.g. PauṣS 36.80-81, SS 24.432-433), while the latter seek liberation only (e.g. PauṣS 31.203, SS 18.51ab).</p>
<p>According to these sources, the two types of worshipper participate alongside each other in the same rituals (PauṣS 31.201-227, SS 7.73), and both may be members of any of the four social classes ( <em>varṇa</em>) (PauṣS 38.26 <em>ff</em>, SS 7.43ab). In one place, the SS (7.37 <em>ff</em>) reports that the devotees who seek liberation only perform divergent rites on different days of the month during the year-long vow ( <em>vrata</em>) to worship the four forms of god,63 and that after the worship, the <em>sakāma</em> and the <em>niṣkāma</em> devotees give different gifts to Brahmins (7.49c-51). Meanwhile, they perform the twelve-day vow ( <em>dvādaśavrata</em>) in the same way, and it grants the same result to both (SS 7.73).</p>
<p>Elsewhere (SS 19.84c-85), it is said that the “Heart mantra” is to be recited with a different ending depending on the goal of the initiate – <em>svāhā</em> for enjoyments ( <em>bhoga</em>) and <em>namas</em> for liberation ( <em>mokṣa</em>). The SS cites another example wherein the <em>niṣkāma</em> and the <em>sakāma</em> devotees worship the mantras of the “manifested deities”</p>
<p>( <em>vibhavadevāḥ</em>) in the same way, only the <em>niṣkāma</em> worshippers (called here “those who practise renunciation”, <em>saṃnyāsakārin</em>) abandon the inevitable fruits of this worship while the <em>sakāma</em> worshippers (or “those who desire the fruits”, <em>phalārthin</em>) accumulate them.64 A passage in the PauṣS (19.51-52b) locates this distinction firmly within orthodox tradition ( <em>smṛti</em>) when it calls these contrasting methods, respectively, the way of “disengagement” or “abstention” ( <em>nivṛtti</em>), and the way of “engagement”</p>
<p>( <em>pravṛtti</em>), terms to which I shall return in Chapter Seven when I discuss the <em>Nārāyaṇīya</em>.65 This passage from the PauṣS is especially notable for its claim that those who seek only pleasures or “enjoyments” ( <em>bhoga</em>) achieve success therein by means of “engagement”, but that once they are satiated by such pleasures, they practise “disengagement”.66</p>
<p>In this last example from the PauṣS, the way of “disengagement” or desireless ( <em>niṣkāma</em>) worship appears to be considered the higher practice for the more advanced initiates. It is striking that while both the SS and the PauṣS contain passages (as referred to above) in which <em>sakāma</em> and <em>niṣkāma</em> are presented as apparently equally legitimate modes of worship, the PauṣS also contains a number of passages wherein *sakāma * worship is condemned, or at the least considered very inferior. Two good examples of this are found in the 31st chapter. In a verse (PauṣS 31.202c-203) I shall return to below when I discuss the Ekāyanas, <em>sakāma</em> worshippers are said to attain only meagre rewards ( <em>svalpaphala</em>), in comparison to *akāma * worshippers who attain the world of Acyuta ( <em>acyutaloka</em>). And before this we are told the following: “The omniscient abiding in the heart does not permit [worship that is performed with] desire. One who grants heaven to his devotees even when it is not asked for – what is 64 SS 10.48-50b: <em>saṃnyāsaṃ sañcayaṃ vāpi kṛtvā samyak kṛtasya vai</em>/ <em>mantrarūpānukāriṇyā</em></p>
<p><em>mudranīyaṃ ca mudrayā</em>// <em>phalārthaṃ prasavaṃ yena naiti saṃnyāsakāriṇām</em>/ <em>phalaparyavasānaṃ</em></p>
<p><em>ca kālam āgamacoditam</em>// <em>hartuṃ no yujyate yena siddhād yais tu phalārthinām</em>/. See Hikita’s (1991) translation of this passage.</p>
<p><em>pravṛttena tu karmaṇā</em>// <em>paritṛptās tu sambhogaiḥ nivṛttenācaranti ca</em>/. [[52]]</p>
<p>it that is not given by him? Therefore, one should abandon requests!”67 Such sentiments provide a striking contrast to other passages in the PauṣS (at e.g. 23.3-5, 31.227, 36.80-81, 38.26-28) which address <em>sakāma</em> and <em>niṣkāma</em> worshippers without favouring one kind over the other. They also contrast with the presentation of <em>sakāma</em> and <em>niṣkāma</em> worship in the SS, which does not contain a similar bias.68 It seems reasonable to assume that the passages in the PauṣS which favour <em>niṣkāma</em> over <em>sakāma</em>, and exhort the rejection of the latter, are the work of a different author from the passages in the same text wherein both approaches are presented as equally valid.</p>
<p>Given that the SS does not contain condemnations of <em>sakāma</em> worship, and that this bias is also almost entirely absent from the JS,69 it is likely that the passages in the PauṣS which strongly favour <em>niṣkāma</em> worship are the work of a later redactor. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that it is in the later, South Indian Pāñcarātra Saṃhitās, as we will see below, that worldly pleasures or enjoyments, and supernatural powers (i.e. <em>bhoga</em>/ <em>siddhi</em>) are commonly treated as inferior or even as illegitimate religious goals.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding these presumably later additions to the PauṣS, there are many passages in this work, as there are also in the SS, wherein <em>sakāma</em> and <em>niṣkāma</em> worshippers are depicted as participating alongside each other in the same rites. In such cases it appears that there would have been no observable difference between the two kinds of worshipper. Both could belong to any of the four social classes ( <em>varṇa</em>) and, as we have seen, it is indicated in the PauṣS that a worshipper may go from being <em>sakāma</em> to being <em>niṣkāma</em> purely according to his own inclinations. Judging by such passages, then, all initiates appear to have been eligible for either mode of worship.</p>
<p>However, both the SS and the PauṣS elsewhere contain a classification of the different 67 PauṣS 31.149c-150: <em>kāṅkṣitaṃ nānujānāti sarvajño hṛdaye sthitaḥ</em> // <em>aprārthito ’pi svargaṃ tu bhaktānāṃ yo dadāti ca</em>/ <em>kim adeyaṃ hi tasyāsti tasmād abhyarthanāṃ tyajet</em> //.</p>
<p>kinds of devotee wherein eligibilty for particular forms of worship <em>is</em> constrained by social class and religious identity. Both of these classifications adopt a fourfold model.</p>
<p>I will discuss that found in the PauṣS below. In the SS, we read near the beginning of the second chapter:</p>
<p><em>aṣṭāṅgayogasiddhānāṃ hṛdyāganiratātmanām</em>// <em>yoginām adhikāraḥ syād ekasmin hṛdayeśaye</em>/ <em>vyāmiśrayāgayuktānāṃ viprāṇāṃ vedavādinām</em>//</p>
<p><em>samantraṃ tu caturvyūhe tv adhikāro na cānyathā</em>/ <em>trayāṇāṃ kṣatriyādīnāṃ</em></p>
<p><em>prapannānāṃ ca tattvataḥ</em>// <em>amantram adhikāras tu caturvyūhakriyākrame</em>/</p>
<p><em>sakriye mantracakre tu vaibhavīye ’vivekinām</em>// <em>mamatāsannirastānāṃ</em></p>
<p><em>svakarmaniratātmanām</em>/ <em>karmavāṅmanasaiḥ samyag bhaktānāṃ parameśvare</em></p>
<p>// <em>caturṇāṃ adhikāro vai prāpte dīkṣākrame sati</em>/. – “With regard to the one who dwells in the heart, the authority [to worship this god] is for yogins who are accomplished in the eight-limbed yoga, whose selves are intent upon internal worship (literally “the sacrifice in the heart”). Regarding [the worship of] the four Vyūhas with mantras, the authority is for none other than the Brahmins who are versed in the Vedas [and] are engaged in mixed worship. And for the [other] three</p>
<p>[social classes] Kṣatriya and so on, who have truly taken refuge [with god], [their]</p>
<p>authority is [also] in the series of rites relating to [the worship of] the four Vyūhas, but [they must perform these] without mantras. For the four [classes, Brahmin etc.]70 who are completely devoted to the supreme lord in action, speech and thought, [and] who are intent upon their own duties, but who lack discrimination [and] who have not cast off egotism, [their] authority, provided they have been properly initiated, is with regard to the mantras relating to the Vibhava manifestations, and the attendant rites.” (SS 2.7c-12b) In his gloss on these verses in his Sanskrit commentary on the SS, the <em>Sātvatatantrabhāṣya</em> (STBh), Alaśiṅgabhaṭṭa draws attention to a very similar classification of initiates that is found in the *Lakṣmītantra *(LT). The major difference in the LT’s presentation is that there are only three categories of initiate: the experts in yoga who have the authority to worship the Supreme Self, those engaged in “mixed yoga” who worship the Vyūhas, and those “lacking in discrimination” who worship the Vibhava deities.71 In other words, the LT does not divide the “mixed worshippers”, as the SS does, into Brahmins on the one hand, and Kṣatriyas, Vaiśyas and Śūdras on the other. The SS’s fourfold classification of initiates is itself mapped onto a threefold 70 My interpretation of this last category of initiate is informed by Alaśiṅgabhaṭṭa’s comments on these verses. For a quite different translation of SS 2.10c-12b, see Schrader (1916: 152). **</p>
<p><em>adhikāraḥ paramātmani</em>// <em>vyāmiśrayogayuktānāṃ madhyānāṃ vyūhabhāvane</em>/ <em>vaibhavīyādirūpeṣu vivekavidhurātmanām</em>//. [[54]]</p>
<p>model of worship, i.e. of god’s <em>para</em>, <em>vyūha</em> and <em>vibhava</em> forms, which is referred to in the SS’s opening chapter (SS 1.23), which forms the organising structure for most of Chapters 2-12, and which is reflected in the three types of initiation ( <em>vibhava</em>, <em>vyūha</em> and <em>sūkṣmā dīkṣā</em>) that are introduced at SS 16.28c-29b.</p>
<p>There is no obvious correspondence between the SS’s fourfold classification of worshippers and that found in several South Indian works which I will address below.</p>
<p>Nor, despite the rather awkward disparity between the four types of initiate and the three types of worship, is there any obvious indication, as far as I can see, that SS</p>
<p>2.7c-12b has been added to the text by a later redactor, though it is notable that the only other reference to “mixed worship” in the SS occurs in the final chapter (SS</p>
<p>25.289ab) which, I will argue below, <em>is</em> a later addition to the text. The prohibition against Kṣatriyas and Vaiśyas worshipping the Vyūhas with mantras is particularly striking, especially in a supposedly “early” Saṃhitā. As we will see, this restrictive attitude towards social class is not found in the JS or the PauṣS, and is more in keeping with the later South Indian works. That there are four types of initiate distinguished may itself be interpreted as an attempt to establish a classificatory method which is at least formally consistent with the Brahminical model of the four social classes ( <em>varṇa</em>) and/or stages of life ( <em>āśrama</em>).</p>
<p>Certainly, the typology of Vaiṣṇavas found in another scriptural work, the *Sanatkumārasaṃhitā *(SanS), very obviously represents a conscious effort to situate its own system ( <em>tantra</em>) within the domain of Brahminical orthopraxy. It does this through applying a fourfold system of classification to the four traditional modes or stages of life ( <em>āśrama</em>), namely that of the celibate student ( <em>brahmacārin</em>), householder ( <em>gṛhastha</em>), hermit or forest-dweller ( <em>vānaprastha</em>), and mendicant or ascetic ( <em>bhikṣuka</em> or <em>yati</em> in the SanS). This fourfold division of the four <em>āśrama</em> s is formally consistent with the earliest extant classification of the four <em>āśrama</em> s, which is found in both the *Āśramopaniṣad * and the <em>Vaikhānasadharmasūtra</em> (Olivelle 1993: 165-166), though with three exceptions (Vaikhānasa, Haṃsa and Paramahaṃsa) the subdivisions are different in this case. The SanS, which may be one of our earliest South Indian Saṃhitās since it is quoted by Yāmuna in his <em>Āgamaprāmāṇya</em> (160.15 <em>ff</em>), offers the 55</p>
<p>following classification of those who belong to the <em>āśrama</em> system and are initiated into the Viṣṇumaṇḍala (SanS <em>Brahmarātra</em> 5.4c-42):72</p>
<p>Celibate students are known as either Brahmacārin, Liṅgin, Śiṣya or Upāsaka.</p>
<p>The Brahmacārin carries a staff, wears an antelope hide ( <em>ajina</em>), is devoted to studying the Veda and worshipping god, eats unsalted food ( <em>akṣāralavaṇāśin</em>) and food acquired by begging ( <em>bhaikṣāhāra</em>), and is moderate in his diet ( <em>mitāśana</em>). He is always intent upon honouring his teacher (SanS <em>Brahmarātra</em> 5.7-8). The Liṅgin, after giving up his ritual duties ( <em>karmāṇi saṃtyajya</em>, or his desires for the fruits thereof?), also eats moderately food that is aquired by begging. He bears the marks of the conch, discus, mace, bow, <em>śṛīvatsa</em> and Kaustubha gem, and worships either god (i.e. Viṣṇu) or Vainateya (Garuḍa) (5.9-10). The Śiṣya also begs for his food, eats moderately, serves his teacher, and worships Hari (5.11-12b). The Upāsaka performs his ablutions and worships god at dawn, noon and dusk, is devoted to mantra-repetition ( <em>japa</em>), the fire-sacrifice ( <em>homa</em>), study, and the eight-syllabled mantra, and honours his teacher (5.12c-14b).</p>
<p>Householders, the second stage of life, consist of Vratins, Gṛhasthas, Āḍhyas and Ācāryas. The Vratin fasts and performs vows ( <em>vrata</em>), is devoted to worshipping, eats moderately and at night, only makes sexual advances on his wife at the times of the month when she is at her most fertile ( <em>ṛtugāmin</em>), has his senses under control, and is devoted to the <em>mūlamantra</em> (5.15c-16). The Gṛhastha also fasts and performs vows, studies the Saṃhitās, and supports his students (5.17-18b). The Āḍhya (literally</p>
<p>“wealthy”) is free from desire and anger, is devoted to his guests, whom he feeds, is happy, participates in religious festivals, and supports devotees (5.18c-20b). The Ācārya is learned in the rite of installation ( <em>pratiṣṭhā</em>) and in Vedic and Tantric worship ( <em>yāge vaidikatāntrike</em>), is temperate, kind to his pupils, and is a knower and proclaimer of the Tantra (5.20c-22b).</p>
<p>Forest dwellers or hermits are also four: the Vaikhānasa, Tantrin, Guru and Niṣkala. The Vaikhānasa eats unsalted food, has a wife and son, lives either at home 72 Rastelli (2002a: 132), remarking on the central role of the maṇḍala in the SanS in general, notes the following: “In this text, ‘one should undergo the initiation’ is expressed by the phrase <em>praviṣed dīkṣāṃ</em></p>
<p><em>cakramaṇḍale</em>, ‘one should attain the initiation in the <em>cakramaṇḍala</em>,’ which shows the centrality of the maṇḍala in the <em>dīkṣā</em>.” [[56]]</p>
<p>or in a hermitage ( <em>āśrama</em>), is not lazy ( <em>atandrita</em>), explicates the Saṃhitās, sleeps on the floor on an antelope hide, and is devoted to meditation ( <em>dhyāna</em>) and knowledge (5.23c-25). The Tantrin lives outside of a village, worships god at dawn, noon and dusk, is devoted to the fire-sacrifice ( <em>homa</em>) and the repetition of mantras ( <em>japa</em>), though only of Tantric mantras, is clothed either in a garment made of bark ( <em>valkala</em>) or in an antelope hide, sleeps on <em>darbha</em> grass, and is devoted to the eight-syllabled mantra (5.26-27). The Guru also wears either bark or an antelope hide, performs ablutions at dawn, noon and dusk, feeds on roots and fruits and has no fixed abode ( <em>aniyatāvāsa</em>), frequents sacred bathing places ( <em>tīrtha</em>), is devoted to meditation ( <em>dhyāna</em>), is always worshipping Viṣṇu, and recites the twelve-syllabled mantra, knowing well the reality which it designates (5.28-30b). The Niṣkala is clothed in the same way, is devoted to the eight-syllabled mantra, eats only at night ( <em>naktabhojin</em>), is easily satisfied and free from envy, worships at dawn, noon and dusk, is indifferent to praise and blame, is dispassionate, and observes a vow of silence ( <em>maunin</em>) (5.30c-33b).</p>
<p>Finally, the ascetic ( <em>yati</em>) is either a Haṃsa, Paramahaṃsa, Bhagavant or Prabhu.</p>
<p>The Haṃsa wears the mark of the conch and discus, carries a single staff ( <em>ekadaṇḍin</em>), is skilled in the ritual of the Tantras ( <em>tantrakarma</em>), wears either red-brown garments ( <em>kāṣāya</em>) or an antelope skin, and has the hair-tuft ( <em>śikhā</em>) and the sacred thread ( <em>yajñopavīta</em>) (5.34c-36b). The Paramahaṃsa lives alone, also carries a single staff and is skilled in the ritual of the Tantras, is devoted to meditation, knowledge and non-dual philosophy ( <em>advaita</em>), has abandoned the hair-tuft and the sacred thread, and observes a vow of celibacy (5.36c-38). The Bhagavant bears the marks of conch and discus, and always carries a cushion made of grass ( <em>brasī</em>), a shoulder pole ( <em>śikya</em>), a gourd pitcher ( <em>kamaṇḍalu</em>), the triple staff ( <em>tridaṇḍin</em>), and the <em>yogapaṭṭika</em> cloth. He is devoted to Vāsudeva, and to the eight-syllabled mantra (5.39-40). Last of all, the Prabhu, like the Bhagavant, carries a triple staff and is devoted to the eight-syllabled mantra, and he also carries a Garuḍa banner ( <em>garuḍadhvaja</em>), and worships god at dawn, noon and dusk (5.41-42).</p>
<p>The classification of the sixteen different types of initiated Vaiṣṇava summarised here is, as far as I am aware, not found in any other text. Needless to say, the fourfold 57</p>
<p>division of each <em>āśrama</em> is suspiciously neat, and its formal consistency with earlier classifications was very likely a more significant motivation to the author than was an accurate reflection of the reality of the situation. Nonetheless, there are several points of interest here. Firstly, the inclusion of the Vaikhānasas and the “single-staffed”</p>
<p>Haṃsas and Paramahaṃsas is especially notable. These are the only categories of <em>āśramin</em> in the SanS’s list which are also named in the previously mentioned <em>Āśramopaniṣad</em> and <em>Vaikhānasadharmasūtra</em>, and they are also the only types of Vaiṣṇava listed here of whom we can confidently say that they were very probably not initiated Pāñcarātrikas, despite their inclusion in the ‘Viṣṇumaṇḍala’. For in the previous chapter of the SanS ( <em>Brahmarātra</em> 4.30-31), twice-born Vaikhānasas ( <em>vaikhānasā dvijāḥ</em>) are explicitly contrasted with “initiates” ( <em>dīkṣitāḥ</em>), while the Haṃsas and Paramahaṃsas are clearly both Advaitins (though only the latter are explicitly described as such), as is indicated by the fact that they carry a “single staff”</p>
<p>(see Olivelle 1993: 172). The inclusion of both of these groups in the Viṣṇumaṇḍala is very likely an attempt by the author of this passage to include and thereby subordinate members of other religious traditions within his own. The order in which the different types of Vaiṣṇava are named suggests an ascending hierarchy, and the Vaikhānasas are mentioned first among the hermits, while the Haṃsas and Paramahaṃsas precede the “triple staffed” Bhagavant and Prabhu. However, their inclusion here also suggests that the boundaries between Vaiṣṇava traditions in this particular time and place may not have been as clear as is ordinarily supposed. Certainly, the verses referred to above in the SanS’s previous chapter illustrate that Vaikhānasas had a certain authority in the eyes of the authors of this work. For it is said there that they may be accepted as judges in a legal dispute ( <em>vyavahāra</em>) when an initiate ( <em>dīkṣita</em>) is not available, and indeed that they are to be preferred in such circumstances over initiated students ( <em>brahmacārin</em>).73</p>
<p>It is certainly notable that the terms ‘Pañcarātra/Pāñcarātrika’ do not feature in the SanS’s classification of the sixteen different types of Vaiṣṇava, and that aside from the references to the twelve-syllabled and eight-syllabled mantras, there is very little here that identifies these <em>āśramin</em> s as belonging to the Pāñcarātra in particular. In this 73 The passage in which these verses appear in the SanS is translated and discussed by Derrett (1978). **[[58]]</p>
<p>regard, it is especially striking that the Upāsaka, Tantrin, Guru, Niṣkala and Prabhu are all described as worshipping god (and/or bathing) three times a day ( <em>trisaṃdhya</em>), i.e.</p>
<p>at dawn, noon, and dusk, while there is no mention of the worship at “five times”</p>
<p>( <em>pañcakāla</em>) which, according to the textual sources, was to become such a characteristic Pāñcarātrika practice in South India. We may interpret the SanS’s classification of “initiates into the Viṣṇumaṇḍala”, perhaps, as an attempt to impose a cohesiveness and a systematicity onto diverse traditions of Vaiṣṇava worship, where in reality there was probably little of either.</p>
<p>The same can also presumably be said of the JS’s classification of fifteen different types of Vaiṣṇava. Unlike the SS and the PauṣS, the JS does not make the basic distinction between <em>sakāma</em> and <em>niṣkāma</em> worshippers, tending to view liberation and enjoyments ( <em>bhoga</em>/ <em>bhukti</em>) or perfections ( <em>siddhi</em>) as simultaneously valid goals for the initiate (see e.g. JS 6.4, 8.2, 14.80, 16.4, 56-58b, 20.243ab, 31.44, 33.53). The SS (e.g. 19.4, 85c-86, 123) and the PauṣS (e.g. 29.61, 30.6, 32.126b-131) also refer to devotees who aspire to both goals. The absence of a distinction between <em>sakāma</em> and <em>niṣkāma</em> worshippers in the JS may indicate that this distinction was a later innovation.</p>
<p>In Chapters 20-22 of the JS, fifteen different types of Vaiṣṇava are named, classified into three groups of five. The first group consists of the Yati, Ekāntin, Vaikhānasa, Karmasāttvata and Śikhin. These are described in the 22nd chapter as follows: The Yati is a celibate ascetic who worships Viṣṇu alone in thought, word and deed. He sees Viṣṇu in all beings, and all beings in Viṣṇu. He obtains cooked food ( <em>siddhānna</em>) from Brahmins without having to beg ( <em>ayācita</em>). He has a shaved head and beard, wears a red-brown garment, carries only a staff, and is himself a Brahmin (JS 22.6-10). The Ekāntin, who is also a renunciant, but whose social class is not stated, I discuss at length in Chapter Eight. The Vaikhānasa is a propertied ( <em>parigrahavat</em>) Brahmin who supports his family by begging from other Brahmins, and by wealth obtained without begging from Kṣatriyas and Vaiśyas. He has matted hair ( <em>jaṭin</em>), carries an umbrella ( <em>chatrin</em>, though normally <em>chattrin</em>), and wears white (JS 22.13c-15b). In this description, the Vaikhānasa appears to inhabit a role which is somewhere between that of householder and renunciant, which may reflect an attempt by the author of these verses to present an account of Vaikhānasas which is consistent 59</p>
<p>with their status as hermits ( <em>vānaprastha</em>) in older literature such as the Dharmaśāstras (see e.g. Colas 2003). The Karmasāttvata, who is elsewhere called simply ‘Sātvata’</p>
<p>(JS 20.267c, 21.81a), is a Brahmin who supports his family by earning a livelihood ( <em>vṛtti</em>) performing rituals for a king (JS 22.15c-16). This identifies the Karmasāttvatas as professional priests. We know from Yāmuna’s <em>Āgamaprāmāṇya</em> (e.g. 13.10-15.5), wherein ‘Sātvatas’ or ‘Sāttvatas’ are accused of performing <em>pūjā</em> for a living ( <em>vṛttito</em> <em>devatāpūjā</em>, 14.12), that in South India such persons were subject to severe criticism by certain “orthodox” opponents of the Pāñcarātra.74 The Śikhin, finally, is a Brahmin who worships Viṣṇu in his heart, performs the ritual for the ancestors, and is eligible for the four modes of life ( <em>cāturāśramya</em>, JS 22.17-19b).</p>
<p>Before we move on to the next group of five Vaiṣṇavas in the JS, it is worth mentioning here the close similarity between the classificatory scheme just mentioned, and that found in the later *Viṣṇusaṃhitā *(ViṣṇuS). The ViṣṇuS, which I will discuss in greater detail in subsequent chapters, is a South Indian Pāñcarātra scripture which may have been written as late as the fourteenth century (Unni 1991: 7-10). In the second chapter of this work, the following is declared: “Just as there are many different branches of the Veda tree, so it is recognised by sages that there are divisions within the Pañcarātra. These [divisions] are distinguished from one another by their having different rituals and texts.”75 Thereupon the five divisions are named as Vaikhānasa, Sāttvata, Śikhin, Ekāntika and Mūlaka (ViṣṇuS 2.26cd). The separate divisions are presented here as “lineages” ( <em>gocarāḥ</em>), and a lineage is said to be equivalent to a</p>
<p>“family” or a “clan” ( <em>kulam</em>, ViṣṇuS 2.25c). I comment further on this passage in the ViṣṇuS in Chapter Eight.</p>
<p>The second group of five Vaiṣṇavas listed in the JS (22.28-37) consists of the Āpta, the Añjalikārin, the Anāpta, the Ārambhin and the Saṃpravartin. At JS 22.28-34b, the Āptas are themselves subdivided into the Sāttvata (who worships god in accordance with the “five times”, <em>pañcakālyena</em>), the Añjalikārin, and the Vipra (who performs the installation rites, <em>pratiṣṭhā</em>). However, elsewhere the Añjalikārin, who is 74 Yāmuna himself rejects this accusation and, as I will demonstrate shortly, does not differentiate between ‘Sātvatas’ and other ‘Bhāgavata’ Brahmins.</p>
<p><em>pañcarātrasya sūribhiḥ</em>// <em>kriyāpāṭhaviśeṣais tu bhidyante te pṛthak pṛthak</em>/. [[60]]</p>
<p>described as abandoning the fruit of the ritual ( <em>saṃnyāsakarmayogena phalasaṃpad</em> <em>vinaiva hi</em>, JS 22.31ab) and as desiring liberation only, is listed as an independent Vaiṣṇava (JS 20.267a, 21.87a). The Anāpta is said to perform the ritual enjoined for Āptas, but without abandoning the duties appropriate to their social class ( <em>varṇadharma</em>, JS 22.34c-35b) – in contrast to the Āptas, we must presume. The Ārambhin is described as worshipping in order to attain wealth (JS 22.35c-36b), and the Saṃpravartin as worshipping Hari “in the wrong way” ( <em>amārgena</em>, JS 22.36c-37b).</p>
<p>In an earlier chapter (JS 20.265-270), each of these five (including the Añjalikārin) together with the five belonging to the first group (the Yati, Ekāntin, Vaikhānasa, Karmasāttvata and Śikhin) are called ‘Pāñcarātrika’, and are seated together during an installation rite and instructed to recite mantras belonging to the Ekāyana recension ( <em>śākhā</em>). I will discuss this passage and its implications below.</p>
<p>Lastly, the JS’s third group of five Vaiṣnavas consists of the Yogin, the Japaniṣṭha, the Tāpasa, the Śāstrajña and the Śāstradhāraka (JS 22.39-56). I have discussed the latter two already in the Introduction. The Yogin is said to think of god as located in his heart, and to practise <em>samādhi</em> and recite mantras in the temple (JS</p>
<p>22.39-41). The Japaniṣṭha, like the Yati, wears a red-brown garment and carries a staff, and also recites mantras or hymns of praise ( <em>stuti</em>) in a low voice ( <em>upāṃśu</em>) (JS</p>
<p>22.42-45b). The Tāpasa performs the Cāndrāyaṇa fast and various ablutions, and eats food acquired by begging, or else survives on milk, roots and fruits (JS 22.45c-51b). It is notable that the members of this last group of five do not participate along with the other ten types of Vaiṣṇava in the installation rite mentioned above (i.e. at JS 20.265-270). While the JS’s classificatory scheme in general seems, like the SanS’s, to be rather too symmetrically arranged to be genuinely descriptive, these last five form an especially disparate group. The presence of the Śāstrajña and the Śāstradhāraka as distinct types of Vaiṣṇava alongside e.g. the Yogin and the Tāpasa seems particularly arbitrary. Elsewhere in the JS (e.g. 1.58), we should note that “knower of the <em>śāstra</em>” is used, rather, as a general term of commendation, and that in the SS (17.138), for example, protecting the scripture ( <em>āgama</em>) is incumbent upon <em>all</em> initiates.</p>
<p>It is highly significant that the Vaikhānasas are included here among the 15</p>
<p>kinds of Vaiṣṇava, for it indicates that these passages (i.e. JS 20.265-270, 21.76c-97, 61</p>
<p>22.1-81b) do not belong to the earliest portions of the JS which, as we have seen, appear to have been composed in either North India or the Upper Deccan. As far as we know, the Vaikhānasas were restricted to South India throughout the premodern period, which suggests that the composition of these passages also occurred in the south.76 This hypothesis is supported by the fact that JS 22.3-5 introduces the diverse ( <em>vaiṣyamya</em>) devotees as all performing the worship of god at the “five times”</p>
<p>( <em>pañcakālaniṣevin</em>), which is then briefly described at JS 22.64c-74b. Elsewhere in the JS, as Rastelli (2000a: 108) has pointed out, the worship according to the “five times”</p>
<p>hardly figures at all. Although this fact alone does not provide conclusive evidence that these passages were composed in South India, among the scriptural works it was certainly in the later southern Saṃhitās that the worship at the “five times” emerges as a central, characteristic feature of the Pāñcarātra liturgy.</p>
<p>It is very difficult to say when these passages may have been added to the JS.</p>
<p>Although the JS’s first group of five Vaiṣṇavas is very similar to a classification of Pāñcarātrikas found in the ViṣṇuS, a late, South Indian work, its list of 15 types of Vaiṣṇava is not found elsewhere. I will argue in a later chapter that JS 20.265-270, at least, shares a number of features with interpolated sections of the SS and the PauṣS, and that the latter appear to be earlier than the more “sectarian” portions of texts such as the PādS and the PārS, which I will address shortly. Presumably JS 20.265-270 is the work of the same redactor/s as JS 21.76c-97, and JS 22. We can be sure, at any rate, that the majority of the descriptions of the different types of Pāñcarātrika or Vaiṣṇava which I have summarised in this section pre-dated Yāmuna, to whose <em>Āgamaprāmāṇya</em> I now turn.77</p>

<p>Colas (1990) has shown that a number of Vaikhānasa works adumbrate sub-groups within the Pāñcarātra. Among these, the <em>Samūrtārcanādhikaraṇa</em> (65.123-125) divides Pāñcarātrikas into <em>āgneya vaiṣṇava</em> s and <em>tāmasa vaiṣṇava</em> s, the former following the rites prescribed in the <em>sūtra</em> of Bodhāyana and others, the latter following those prescribed in the <em>sūtra</em> of Kātyāyana and others. The <em>Samūrtārcanādhikaraṇa</em> is almost certainly earlier than Yāmuna, and may be as early as the ninth century (see Colas 1996: 95). Other Vaikhānasa texts offering variant subdivisions include the <em>Kriyādhikāra</em>, composed at the very latest during the thirteenth century, and possibly considerably earlier (ibid.), and the <em>Ānandasaṃhitā</em>, among the latest of the Vaikhānasa “medieval corpus”.&#160;<a href="#fnref:5" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
