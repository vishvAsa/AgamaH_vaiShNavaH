  <meta property="og:description" content="Several modern scholars (e.g. Jaiswal 1967:40; Brockington 1998: 299) have claimed that the Ekāntins in the Nārāyaṇīya are devotees of Nārāyaṇa, and that they are to be distinguished on this basis from the followers of Vāsudeva, who are considered to be inferior. These two religious groupings, according to this theory, are thus depicted as two distinct Vaiṣṇava “sects”. This reading is based exclusively on the following passage: [[192]]

  <p>Several modern scholars (e.g. Jaiswal 1967:40; Brockington 1998: 299) have claimed that the Ekāntins in the <em>Nārāyaṇīya</em> are devotees of Nārāyaṇa, and that they are to be distinguished on this basis from the followers of Vāsudeva, who are considered to be inferior. These two religious groupings, according to this theory, are thus depicted as two distinct Vaiṣṇava “sects”. This reading is based exclusively on the following passage: [[192]]</p>
<p><em>aho hy ekāntinaḥ sarvān prīṇāti bhagavān hariḥ</em>/ <em>vidhiprayuktāṃ pūjāṃ ca gṛhṇāti bhagavān svayam</em>// <em>ye tu dagdhendhanā loke puṇyapāpavivarjitāḥ</em>/</p>
<p><em>teṣāṃ tvayābhinirdiṣṭā pāraṃparyāgatā gatiḥ</em>// <em>caturthyāṃ caiva te gatyāṃ</em></p>
<p><em>gacchanti puruṣottamam</em>/ <em>ekāntinas tu puruṣā gacchanti paramaṃ padam</em>//</p>
<p><em>nūnam ekāntadharmo ’yaṃ śreṣṭho nārāyaṇapriyaḥ</em>/ <em>agatvā gatayas tisro yad gacchanty avyayaṃ harim</em>//. – “So! Lord Hari loves all Ekāntins, and the Lord himself accepts worship that is performed according to the prescribed methods.</p>
<p>But those whose fuel is burnt up in the world and are [therefore] free from merit and demerit, their path has been indicated by you, and handed down by a succession of teachers. Those on the fourth path go to the Supreme Person; Ekāntins, indeed, are the persons who go to the highest place. Certainly, this <em>ekāntadharma</em>, dear to Nārāyaṇa, is the most excellent because, not going along the [other] three paths, they [i.e. Ekāntins] go to the immortal Hari.” (MBh 12.336.1-4)</p>
<p>The precise meaning of these verses is rather obscure, and hinges on how we interpret the reference to the “three paths” ( <em>gatayas tisro</em>) which are not travelled by those who follow the <em>ekāntadharma</em>. The syntax in the fourth verse, which contains this reference, is particularly puzzling. Following Nīlakaṇṭha’s commentary,319</p>
<p>scholars including Ganguli (2000: 187), Jaiswal, Gonda (1970: 54), Brockington and Sutton (2000: 114) have interpreted these “three paths” as referring to three soteriological “stages” represented by the deified Vṛṣṇi heroes Aniruddha, Pradyumna and Saṃkarṣaṇa. According to this interpretation, followers of Vāsudeva (referred to as Puruṣottama at 336.3b) must pass through each of these three deities before reaching the fourth deity (i.e. Vāsudeva), whereas Ekāntins go straight to “the immortal Hari” (i.e. Nārāyaṇa). It is quite easy to see how this interpretation has been arrived at, but it is beset with problems which I will address below.</p>
<p>The claim that *gatayas tisro * designates the deities Aniruddha, Pradyumna and Saṃkarṣaṇa is no doubt based on the belief that this passage refers back to MBh 12.332.13-18. Certainly, the four verses translated above represent Janamejaya’s summary of what he has learnt thus far, and so it is entirely appropriate that we should interpret them as referring to teachings which have already been articulated in earlier chapters of the <em>Nārāyaṇīya</em>. The only previous account of the Vṛṣṇi deities in a soteriological context occurs at 332.13-18. The passage reads as follows: the 319 BhBhD on 12.336.3-4: <em>caturthyāṃ aniruddhapradyumnasaṃkarṣaṇān apekṣya caturthyāṃ</em></p>
<p>*vāsudevākhyāyāṃ haribhaktānāṃ viśeṣam āha ekāṃtinas tv iti&hellip; *(336.3) / <em>gatayaḥ gatīḥ</em></p>
<p>*aniruddhādīṃs trīn anupāsyaiva vāsudevaṃ gacchatīti arthaḥ *(336.4) /. [[193]]</p>
<p>liberation of those who are “free from merit and demerit” ( <em>puṇyapāpavivarjitāḥ</em>) begins with a journey towards the sun ( <em>āditya</em>), which is called the gate ( <em>dvāra</em>) (13).320 Their bodies burnt by the sun, these beings become invisible and infinitesimal ( <em>paramāṇu</em>), and they enter the god (i.e. Āditya) in this form (14).</p>
<p>Liberated from there, they stay in the body of Aniruddha, and then, having become <em>manas</em>, they enter into Pradyumna (15). Liberated from Pradyumna, these “most excellent Brahmins” ( <em>viprapravarāḥ</em>), the Sāṃkhyas together with the Bhāgavatas, then enter into Saṃkarṣaṇa, the <em>jīva</em> (16). Then, having transcended the three <em>guṇas</em>, they enter into Vāsudeva, who is called the “knower of the field” ( <em>kṣetrajñam</em>) (17).</p>
<p>Verse 18, which I have referred to above, asserts that, with their “minds concentrated and controlled, senses restrained, having attained the state of <em>ekānta</em>, they enter into Vāsudeva”.321 As Malinar (1997: 281) has pointed out, this last verse is at odds with the preceding verses, in which the liberated beings have already been divested of their bodies ( <em>sarvāṅga</em>) and minds ( <em>manas</em>). Hence, it is very probable that verses 13e-17 have been inserted into this passage, and that verse 18 originally immediately followed 13cd (ibid.). We must assume, of course, that this interpolation occurred prior to the composition of 336.1-4, if indeed the “three paths” mentioned there refer to Aniruddha, Pradyumna and Saṃkarṣaṇa.</p>
<p>There are, at the outset, at least two problems with the assumption that 336.1-4</p>
<p>refers back to 332.13-18. Firstly, 336.4, as we have established, refers to three paths (or “stages” if that interpretation is preferred), whereas at 332.13-18, the entrance of the liberated beings into Vāsudeva is preceded by their entrance into, and</p>
<p>“liberation” from, <em>four</em> deities, namely Āditya, Aniruddha, Pradyumna and Saṃkarṣaṇa. Bakker (1997: 59-62) notes that in this account Āditya, the sun, takes the place of Sāmba, one of the original “five heroes” ( <em>pañcavīra</em>) of the Vṛṣṇi clan, 320 The description “free from merit and demerit” ( <em>puṇyapāpavivarjita</em>) is also used to refer to liberated beings who “enter into the thousand-rayed god” at MBh 12.327.5e-6.</p>
<p><em>gacchatāṃ dvijasattama</em>// <em>sarvalokatamohantā ādityo dvāram ucyate</em>/// <em>ādityadagdhasarvāṅgā</em></p>
<p><em>adṛśyāḥ kena cit kva cit</em>/ <em>paramāṇubhūtā bhūtvā tu taṃ devaṃ praviśanty uta</em>// <em>tasmād api vinirmuktā aniruddhatanau sthitāḥ</em>/ <em>manobhūtās tato bhūyaḥ pradyumnaṃ praviśanty uta</em>//</p>
<p><em>pradyumnāc cāpi nirmuktā jīvaṃ saṃkarṣaṇaṃ tathā</em>/ <em>viśanti viprapravarāḥ sāṃkhyā bhāgavataiḥ</em></p>
<p><em>saha</em>// <em>tatas traiguṇyahīnās te paramātmānam añjasā</em>/ <em>praviśanti dvijaśreṣṭha kṣetrajñaṃ</em></p>
<p><em>nirguṇātmakam</em>// <em>sarvāvāsaṃ vāsudevaṃ kṣetrajñaṃ viddhi tattvataḥ</em>/// <em>samāhitamanaskāś ca niyatāḥ saṃyatendriyāḥ</em>/ <em>ekāntabhāvopagatā vāsudevaṃ viśanti te</em>//. [[194]]</p>
<p>who was subsequently expelled from the pantheon when Pāñcarātra authors developed a theology of four differentiated forms of god ( <em>vyūha</em>). Sāmba, observes Bakker, was closely related to the cult of the sun (Sūrya), both mythologically and iconographically. In other words, in the above account, which is not described or alluded to anywhere else in the <em>Nārāyaṇīya</em>, Āditya is almost certainly to be considered as much a “stage” in the process of ascent undertaken by liberated beings as are the other Vṛṣṇi deities. Of course, it could be argued that Sāmba or Āditya had already been dropped from the pantheon by the time 336.1-4 was composed, and that the devotee of Nārāyaṇa who authored these verses was aware of this, and adjusted the number accordingly. This, then, would be the only place in the text in which the entrance of liberated beings into Vāsudeva is represented as the fourth stage in a hierarchy of ascent. But this still leaves us with the following question: why did the author of 336.1-4 choose to refer only to “three paths” which are not travelled by Ekāntins? For if, as is alleged, these verses can be taken as evidence for an intra-Vaiṣṇava sectarianism, then surely there are four “paths” which Ekāntins do not travel, for they do not go to Vāsudeva either - they go to Hari or Nārāyaṇa.</p>
<p>This brings me to the second problem with the assumption that 336.1-4 refers back to 332.13-18. At verse 18, as we have seen, those who enter into Vāsudeva are said to have “attained the state of <em>ekānta</em>” ( <em>ekāntabhāvopagata</em>). This is another way of saying that they are Ekāntins. According to the “sectarian” interpretation of 336.1-4, however, Ekāntins are devotees of Nārāyaṇa, and <em>not</em> of Vāsudeva. In other words, the very passage that 336.1-4 supposedly refers back to explicitly contradicts the idea that Ekāntins are to be distinguished from the followers of Vāsudeva. Moreover, if, as is alleged (for example by Jaiswal 1967: 40 n. 3), the “Supreme Person”</p>
<p>( <em>puruṣottama</em>) is used exclusively as an epithet of Vāsudeva (and thus can only refer to him at 336.3b), then there are also other instances in the <em>Nārāyaṇīya</em> in which Ekāntins are identified as followers of this deity (e.g. 323.24, 336.66). However, it is not at all obvious that *puruṣottama * at 336.3b refers specifically to Vāsudeva. For, contrary to Jaiswal’s claim, elsewhere in the <em>Nārāyaṇīya</em> we find this honorific applied to, for instance, the *ṛṣis * Nara and Nārāyaṇa ( <em>puruṣottamau</em>, 331.29b), Hari (331.41d, 335.41b, 62d, 65d) and, later in chapter 336 itself, to the god Nārāyaṇa 195</p>
<p>(336.18b, 66b, 74b). Indeed, the final section of the <em>Nārāyaṇīya</em> explicitly addresses the question (asked by Rudra at 338.23) “who is the Puruṣottama?” Brahmā’s answer is quite clear. The “Supreme Person” is Nārāyaṇa (339.14). Vāsudeva is not mentioned here, nor indeed anywhere else in the final four chapters (336-339) of the <em>Nārāyaṇīya</em>. Finally, it should be noted that if we assume that <em>puruṣottama</em> at 336.3b refers to Vāsudeva, then this would be the only passage in the whole of the <em>Nārāyaṇīya</em> in which Vāsudeva and Nārāyaṇa, or their respective devotees, are clearly distinguished from each other in such a manner.</p>
<p>In light of the above, we must conclude that the “sectarian” reading of 336.1-4</p>
<p>is unwarranted. It is far more likely that the “Supreme Person” in this passage refers to (Hari-)Nārāyaṇa,322 as is the case when the term *puruṣottama * is employed later on in the same chapter. This requires, then, that we take the enclitic particle *tu * at 336.3c to be emphatic rather than adversative, and that we interpret “the Supreme Person”</p>
<p>and “the highest place” as referring to the same thing. Now we must address the question as to what is referred to by the “three paths” ( <em>gatayas tisro</em>) at 336.4c. As mentioned above, much of the secondary literature on the <em>Nārāyaṇīya</em> follows Nīlakaṇṭha’s reading. Esnoul (1979: 197-198) does not appear to agree with this reading, but does not directly address the problem. Nor does the collaborative volume <em>Nārāyaṇīya-Studien</em>. Thus far, I have been able to find in the Indological literature only one alternative interpretation of these verses, which is that offered by Peter Hill. According to Hill (2001: 291), the <em>ekāntadharma</em> is the most excellent</p>
<p>“since, without passing through the three stages (of life) they go (directly) to the immutable Hari.” We can presume that by “stages of life” here, Hill is referring to the <em>āśrama</em> s in their “classical formulation” (Olivelle 1993: 131), i.e. as successive modes of life. I do not find this reading very convincing, for reasons which will become obvious shortly.</p>
<p>The passage in question (336.1-4) implies that there are four “paths” or “ways”</p>
<p>( <em>gati</em>), and that among these the way of the Ekāntins is the most excellent. To my mind, the earlier teaching in the *Nārāyaṇīya * which this most closely resembles is that given at 12.328.30-32. Here, Lord Kṛṣṇa tells Arjuna that his devotees are of 322 This is consistent with Esnoul’s (1979: 197-198) translation of these verses. [[196]]</p>
<p>“four kinds” ( <em>caturvidhā</em>). “Among these”, he continues, “the Ekāntins, [for whom]</p>
<p>there are no other gods, are the most excellent. I alone am the way ( <em>gati</em>) for them, the performers of actions not motivated by desire.” He goes on to say that the remaining three types of devotee desire the fruits of their actions, and that they are all destined to “sink down”. The following verse, which may have been added later, identifies these latter devotees with the worship of Brahmā, Śiva and “other gods”.323</p>
<p>Malinar (1997: 258-264) notes that this classification of four types of devotee is most likely borrowed from the *Bhagavadgītā *(7.16-17b),324 and that the immediate context of the above verses in MBh 12.328 – namely, a conversation between Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna which extols the merits of the renunciation of personal desires – contains obvious echoes of that text. Unlike in the <em>Bhagavadgītā</em>, the other three types of devotee are not explicitly named in MBh 12.328.</p>
<p>We return now to MBh 12.336.1-4. These verses also occur in a context which refers to the <em>Bhagavadgītā</em> (at 336.8).325 Indeed, Vaiśaṃpāyana’s response to Janamejaya’s questions (at 336.6e-7b) includes the first reference to the conversation between Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna since the latter’s extended discussion (328.5-330.71), during which the classification of the four kinds of devotee was taught. Later in chapter 336, the Ekāntins are characterised, as at 328.30, by the fact that their actions are not motivated by desire ( <em>āśīḥkarmavivarjita</em>, 336.58f). That neither the three other kinds of devotee nor the three paths not travelled by Ekāntins are explicitly named may suggest that this fourfold classification is merely a formal model, authoritative because of its link to the teaching of the four kinds of devotee in the <em>Bhagavadgītā</em>. In other words, it is quite possible that the author of 336.1-4 had no particular “three paths” in mind when these verses were composed. However, it is also possible, in my opinion, that three other distinct “paths” <em>were</em> intended by the 323 MBh 12.328.30-32d: <em>caturvidhā mama janā bhaktā evaṃ hi śrutam</em>/ <em>teṣām ekāntinaḥ śreṣṭhās te caivānanyadevatāḥ</em>// <em>aham eva gatis teṣāṃ nirāśīḥkarmakāriṇām</em>/// <em>ye ca śiṣṭās trayo bhaktāḥ</em></p>
<p><em>phalakāmā hi te matāḥ</em>/ <em>sarve cyavanadharmāṇaḥ pratibuddhas tu śreṣṭhabhāk</em>// <em>brahmāṇaṃ</em></p>
<p><em>śitikaṇṭhaṃ ca yāś cānyā devatāḥ smṛtāḥ prabuddhavaryāḥ sevante māṃ evaiṣyanti yat param</em>//.</p>
<p><em>bhagavatā svayam</em> //. [[197]]</p>
<p>author of this passage, and that clues to the identity of these are provided in the verses which immediately follow:</p>
<p><em>sahopaniṣadān vedān ye viprāḥ samyag āsthitāḥ</em>/ <em>paṭhanti vidhim āsthāya ye cāpi yatidharmiṇaḥ</em>// <em>tebhyo viśiṣṭāṃ jānāmi gatim ekāntināṃ nṛṇām</em>/. –</p>
<p>“Those Brahmins who recite perfectly the Vedas together with the Upaniṣads, in accordance with the prescribed method, and those who follow the <em>dharma</em> of the ascetic - I know that the way of the Ekāntin men is better than those!” (MBh 12.336.5-6d)</p>
<p>To whom is Janamejaya referring when he speaks of those who follow the <em>dharma</em> of the ascetic? As we have seen above, in the first chapter of Part B of the <em>Nārāyaṇīya</em>, the <em>dharma</em> of the ascetic is called the <em>nivṛttidharma</em>, and it is associated with the traditions of Sāṃkhya and Yoga. The *nivṛttidharma * is contrasted there with the <em>dharma</em> of <em>pravṛtti</em>, which is associated with the Veda (327.61-66). These three traditions (Sāṃkhya, Yoga and Veda) are listed alongside each other again at the end of chapter 335, shortly before Janamejaya’s reference to the “three paths” not travelled by Ekāntins. Here it says that Hari is the “receptacle” ( <em>nidhi</em>) of the Vedas, and of asceticism ( <em>tapas</em>), that he is “Sāṃkhya” and “Yoga”. In the following verse, the Vedas are typified by “sacrifices” ( <em>yajñā</em>) which have Nārāyaṇa as their nature.</p>
<p>The same is then said of the path ( <em>gati</em>) that is intent upon Nārāyaṇa, which is epitomised by asceticism ( <em>tapas</em>). Though Sāṃkhya and Yoga are not mentioned here a second time, they are clearly intended, for “the path intent upon Nārāyaṇa”</p>
<p>refers to the <em>nivṛttidharma</em>, which is contrasted then with the <em>dharma</em> that is characterised by <em>pravṛtti</em>. Both <em>dharma</em> s have Nārāyaṇa as their nature.326 A few verses later, ascetics ( <em>yati</em>) who “know the Self” are identified as Sāṃkhyas and Yogins.327 In this latter verse, as is common in the <em>Nārāyaṇīya</em>, Sāṃkhya and Yoga are nominally distinguished from each other, but treated as more or less the same.328</p>
<p><em>nārāyaṇaparā gatiḥ</em>// <em>nārāyaṇaparaṃ satyam ṛtaṃ nārāyaṇātmakam</em>/ <em>nārāyaṇaparo dharmaḥ</em></p>
<p><em>punarāvṛttidurlabhaḥ</em>// <em>pravṛttilakṣaṇaś caiva dharmo nārāyaṇātmakaḥ</em>/.</p>
<p>For the present purposes, it is important to note that although the <em>Nārāyaṇīya</em> does not explicitly differentiate between Sāṃkhya and Yoga on matters of practice or doctrine, it nonetheless recognises them as two distinct ascetic traditions or “paths”.</p>
<p>Of course, the chief purpose of this passage at the end of chapter 335 is to assimilate and subordinate the three traditions called Veda, Sāṃkhya and Yoga to a supreme and all-encompassing theology of Nārāyaṇa. This method is already met with in late portions of Part A (326.64-65, 100-101b) and it can also be found in previous chapters in Part B (e.g. at 327.60-66, and 334.14-17). However, the most sustained attempt to articulate the inclusion of Veda, Sāṃkhya and Yoga within a single comprehensive <em>dharma</em>, which originates from Nārāyaṇa (336.10) and has Nārāyaṇa as its goal ( <em>niṣṭhā</em>, 337.65), occurs in chapters 336-337. In chapter 336, this <em>dharma</em>, alternatively called <em>ekānta</em> (4a), <em>sātvata</em> (27ab, 31c, 78ab), and <em>pañcarātra</em> (76), is shown to contain within itself the seemingly antithetical paths represented by the Veda, on the one hand, and by Sāṃkhya and Yoga on the other. The question as to how (and why) Nārāyaṇa has established both the <em>pravṛtti</em> and the <em>nivṛtti</em> <em>dharma</em> s has already been answered in the opening chapter of Part B (327), but only now is the <em>dharma</em> of the Ekāntins explicitly shown to include and transcend these. Thus, for instance, we are told that it is with the <em>ekāntadharma</em> that Nārāyaṇa created the sacrifices to gods and ancestors ( <em>daivaṃ pitryam</em>) (336.13def). The <em>ekāntadharma</em> is the same as ( <em>tulya</em>) Sāṃkhya and Yoga (336.69ab). Sāṃkhya, Yoga and the</p>
<p>“Āraṇyaka of the Vedas” ( <em>vedāraṇyaka</em>) are mutually complementary parts ( <em>parasparāṅgāni</em>) of the <em>dharma</em> of the Ekāntins, called in this instance <em>pañcarātra</em>.329 In chapter 337, in answer to Janamejaya’s question as to whether the branches of knowledge Sāṃkhya, Yoga, Pañcarātra and the Āraṇyaka of the Vedas have the same goal, or different goals (1-2), Vaiśaṃpāyana replies that according to tradition and knowledge, all branches of knowledge have Nārāyaṇa as their goal (63c-64b). He alone is the creator of the <em>śāstra</em> s (65). ‘Pañcarātra’ here appears to be simply another name for the <em>ekāntadharma</em> since, unlike the other branches of emphasises the soteriological method of knowledge. Elsewhere in the <em>Mokṣadharmaparvan</em>, the distinct tradition of Yoga is shown to favour the method of strength or power ( <em>bala</em>). On this see Fitzgerald ( <em>forthcoming</em>).</p>
<p>knowledge, it is proclaimed directly by Nārāyaṇa (60-63b), and it is said that</p>
<p>“knowers of <em>pañcarātra</em>” attain the state of <em>ekānta</em> ( <em>ekāntabhāva</em>) and enter into Hari (67).330 Pointedly, the same is not said of experts in Sāṃkhya, Yoga and Veda, though the next verse (68) does affirm that each of these is eternal ( <em>sanātana</em>).331</p>
<p>On the basis of the exposition of the <em>ekāntadharma</em> in chapters 336-337, then, it seems reasonable to infer that the three “paths” not travelled by Ekāntins are precisely Sāṃkhya, Yoga and Veda. These do not lead to “the highest place”. It has already been stated that Nārāyaṇa, or the *dharma * of Nārāyaṇa, is “difficult to reach for those who are subject to rebirth” ( <em>punarāvṛttidurlabhaḥ</em>), by whom is meant the followers of the Veda and the path of ritual action (i.e. <em>pravṛtti</em>).332 Later in chapter 336, it will be claimed that Hari “does not look at” one who is born into the <em>pravṛttidharma</em>. Such a one is looked at, rather, by Brahmā (whose “glance” is not salvific).333 And in chapter 339, Brahmā will clearly state that the “supreme path”</p>
<p>cannot be reached by the methods of Sāṃkhya and Yoga.334 The author/s of chapters 336-337 nonetheless include these three paths within the fourth and highest path, the comprehensive <em>dharma</em> of the Ekāntins, also called ‘Pañcarātra’. This deliberately inclusivist or syncretist agenda, wherein other teachings or traditions are subsumed and subordinated, appears to belong to the later redactions of the *Nārāyaṇīya * since it is only evident in the supposedly youngest portions of Part A (as identified by Oberlies 1997a and 1997b), and in Part B.</p>
<p>In the remainder of this section, I will draw attention to the fact that a syncretist policy was applied not only to Sāṃkhya, Yoga and Veda, but also to what appear to have originally been distinct traditions of worship. For example, the denominations 330 MBh 12.337.67: <em>pañcarātravido ye tu yathākramaparā nṛpa</em>/ <em>ekāntabhāvopagatās te hariṃ</em></p>
<p><em>praviśanti vai</em>//.</p>
<p><em>viśāṃ pate</em>// <em>pravṛttilakṣaṇair yuktaṃ nāvekṣati hariḥ svayam</em>/// <em>paśyaty enaṃ jāyamānaṃ</em></p>
<p><em>brahmā lokapitāmahaḥ</em>/ <em>rajasā tamasā caiva mānuṣaṃ samabhiplutam</em>//.</p>
<p><em>sātvata</em> and <em>bhāgavata</em> are clearly not used in this text to refer to distinct “sects”.335</p>
<p>Rather, they appear merely as alternative names for the followers of Nārāyaṇa.</p>
<p>Moreover, as we will see, the authors of the <em>Nārāyaṇīya</em> make no attempt to explicitly subordinate the followers of Vāsudeva, for instance, to those of Nārāyaṇa.</p>
<p>Rather, their equivalence, and indeed that of the gods themselves, is assumed. Thus, in the passage 328.16-29, the names Viṣṇu and Nārāyaṇa are used interchangeably to refer to the same god. This also occurs at 333.24-25. Elsewhere, at 331.9-11 the name Viṣṇu is used interchangeably with Vāsudeva, while at 335.87 it is said that Viṣṇu is called Vāsudeva because he is the abode of all beings ( <em>sarvabhūtakṛtāvāsa</em>).336 In chapter 328, when Janamejaya asks for the various names by which Hari-Nārāyaṇa is known, Vaiśaṃpāyana refers him to Hari/Keśava’s answer when asked the same question by Arjuna. Here we are told that Hari-Nārāyaṇa/Kṛṣṇa is called Vāsudeva because he is the abode of all beings ( <em>sarvabhūtādhivāsa</em>, 36cd), and that he is also called Viṣṇu among other names. The name Vāsudeva itself occurs on four separate occasions in Part B, and is used as follows: i.) as one of god’s various names, in the verse just referred to (328.36); ii.) as a name for Viṣṇu (335.87), as referred to above; iii.) at 331.9-11, wherein Vāsudeva and Viṣṇu are assimilated;337 and iv.) as the fifth and final deified Vṛṣṇi hero into whom the liberated “Sāṃkhyas and Bhāgavatas” enter (332.13-18), as discussed earlier. In this last passage, as on other occasions, Vāsudeva’s name is explained etymologically – he is the abode of all ( <em>sarvāvāsa</em>, 332.17e). He is, in addition, called here the knower of the field ( <em>kṣetrajña</em>, 17d, f), a designation which is also applied to Vāsudeva in one of the apparently youngest passages of Part A (326.38) (discussed below), and which is elsewhere assigned to Nārāyaṇa (325.4/05, 327.67, 339.6), Hari (336.54), and Kṛṣṇa (330.9).</p>
<p><em>prāptavāñ jayam uttamam</em>// <em>na cāsya kiṃ cid aprāpyaṃ manye lokeṣv api triṣu</em>/ <em>trailokyanātho</em> <em>viṣṇuḥ sa yasyāsīt sāhyakṛt sakhā</em>// <em>dhanyāś ca sarva evāsan brahmaṃs te mama pūrvakāḥ</em>/ <em>hitāya</em> <em>śreyase caiva yeṣām āsīj janārdanaḥ</em>//. [[201]]</p>
<p>The infrequency with which Vāsudeva’s name is used in Part B is consistent with Part A, where it is found in only three separate passages, and implied in a fourth. In these it is used as follows: i.) as a name for Nārāyaṇa during Nārada’s <em>stotra</em> (325.4/130); ii.) as the name of the “twenty-fifth” principle ( <em>tattva</em>), the “Self of the world” ( <em>lokasyātmā</em>), the “Supreme Self” ( <em>paramātmā</em>), the *puruṣa * who is seen by knowledge ( <em>jñāna</em>), the Self of all beings, the knower of the field etc., in a passage (326.20-39) which, employing terminology usually associated with Sāṃkhya, describes the reabsorption ( <em>pra-√lī</em>) of the five universal elements, and the successive emergence of the embodied self ( <em>jīva</em>), the mind ( <em>manas</em>) and the act of self-formulation ( <em>ahaṃkāra</em>). The latter are personified as, respectively, Saṃkarṣaṇa, Pradyumna and Aniruddha. Oberlies (1997a) adjudges this passage to have been interpolated into chapter 326 at a late stage; iii.) Vāsudeva is not named in the verses 326.68-71d, but it is likely he who is referred to as the “fourth form” ( <em>mūrtiś</em> <em>caturthī</em>) who created Saṃkarṣana, who in turn begot Pradyumna, from whom is born Aniruddha, and then Brahmā; and iv.) during the <em>paraṃparā</em> which draws Part A to a close, it is said that this narrative is not to be given to one who is not a devotee of Vāsudeva.338 In the same passage, we are told that this “great Upaniṣad” has been sung by Nārāyaṇa (326.100-101b), and that Janārdana should be worshipped as the Supreme Person ( <em>puruṣottama</em>, 326.119-120).</p>
<p>What can we infer from these infrequent references to Vāsudeva? Clearly, we must conclude that if the <em>Nārāyaṇīya</em> was at one time in the hands of “sectarian”</p>
<p>followers of Vāsudeva, then they did not make very good use of it. It is much more likely, of course, that these eight passages (from Parts A and B) were included in the text by authors who also professed devotion to Nārāyaṇa.339 Since Nārāyaṇa is clearly the principal god in the <em>Nārāyaṇīya</em>, and since archaeological and inscriptional evidence (on which see e.g. Härtel 1987) tells us that the worship of Vāsudeva was not <em>always</em> linked to the worship of Nārāyaṇa, we must assume that 338 MBh 12.326.113: <em>idam ākhyānam ārṣeyaṃ pāraṃparyāgataṃ nṛpa</em>/ <em>nāvāsudevabhaktāya tvayā</em></p>
<p><em>deyaṃ kathaṃ cana</em>//.</p>
<p>followers of Nārāyaṇa had adopted Vāsudeva into their own theology. They may have done this for purely “political” reasons, i.e. as a way of subordinating and dominating a rival “sect”. But the *Nārāyaṇīya * offers no evidence for this, and in fact points to another explanation. As we have seen above, the only “Vāsudeva passages”</p>
<p>which do not merely assimilate this god to Viṣṇu or Nārāyaṇa are those which identify the four or five deified Vṛṣṇi heroes with a series of emergent ontological principles (326.35-39), which function also as successive cosmic realms or levels through which liberated beings ascend (332.13-18). We can presume, then, that it is these passages which are able to offer us a better idea as to why Vāsudeva was considered important and worthy of adoption. If this is the case, it is inevitable that Vāsudeva’s importance derived in some way from his association with Saṃkarṣana, Pradyumna and Aniruddha.</p>
<p>That these four “forms” ( <em>mūrti</em>, 326.68a) were together considered important is proven by the fact that they are explicitly incorporated into the theology of Hari-Nārāyaṇa. This occurs at 336.51-56 and at 339.12, and 18-20. In the former passage, it is said that Hari is viewed as having one, two, three or four forms ( <em>vyūha</em>).340</p>
<p>Strongly echoing the account of the “Vāsudeva passage” 326.20-39, outlined above, these four <em>vyūha</em> s are identified as the knower of the field ( <em>kṣetrajña</em>, 336.54a), the embodied self ( <em>jīva</em>, 336.54cd), the mind ( <em>manas</em>, 336.55a), and the “agent, effect and cause” ( <em>kartā ca kāryaṃ kāraṇam</em>, 336.56ab. Cf. 326.37). In the final chapter of the <em>Nārāyaṇīya</em>, meanwhile, Brahmā reveals that Nārāyaṇa has a “fourfold” form (339.12, 20), and that in his role as creator he is called ‘Aniruddha’ (339.18ab).341</p>
<p>Why, then, did Nārāyaṇa theologians consider it expedient to adopt these differentiated divine forms?</p>
<p>The answer must surely involve the ontological principles or “levels” with which they are identified. Elsewhere in the *Mokṣadharmaparvan *(e.g. 12.228, 291, 293-294), these principles ( <em>tattva</em>) belong to the evolutionary cosmogony of Sāṃkhya and Yoga. According to this cosmogony, the lower ontological principles emerge out of the higher ones (see e.g. 294.27-28). The Vṛṣṇi heroes might have 340 MBh 12.336.53: <em>ekavyūhavibhāgo vā kva cid dvivyūhasaṃjñitaḥ</em>/ <em>trivyūhaś cāpi saṃkhyātaś</em> <em>caturvyūhaś ca dṛśyate</em>//. These are the only uses of the term <em>vyūha</em> in the <em>Nārāyaṇīya</em>.</p>
<p>been considered particularly germane to such a process since Pradyumna and Aniruddha are, respectively, the son and grandson of Vāsudeva. By incorporating these successively lower forms of god into this evolutionary scheme, the author of 326.20-39 is able to include within it both a god who remains completely transcendent, and a creator god from whom the universe originates (i.e. Aniruddha <em>,</em> 326.37). This much has been stated by numerous scholars before me. But the divinisation of these levels is important to the soteriological process too. Fitzgerald (forthcoming) discusses the distinct soteriological methods of Sāṃkhya and Yoga, as described in the “text-pair” MBh 12.289-290. Adherents of the method of Yoga, Fitzgerald shows, attempt to forcibly ascend through the levels to <em>mokṣa</em>. The Sāṃkhyas, meanwhile, claim that it is possible to attain mokṣa by way of “a comprehensive knowledge and understanding… [of] ever higher cosmic realities”</p>
<p>(ibid: 298).342 The author of MBh 12.332.13-18 distinguishes the *ekānta * path from both of these. For here, the “Sāṃkhyas together with the Bhāgavatas” do not liberate themselves either forcibly or by knowledge. Rather, each divinised realm that these beings pass through <em>liberates them</em>. In other words, by assigning the Vṛṣṇi deities to these levels, the author of this passage is able to illustrate the apparently new idea that the devotee is liberated not by himself but by god.</p>
