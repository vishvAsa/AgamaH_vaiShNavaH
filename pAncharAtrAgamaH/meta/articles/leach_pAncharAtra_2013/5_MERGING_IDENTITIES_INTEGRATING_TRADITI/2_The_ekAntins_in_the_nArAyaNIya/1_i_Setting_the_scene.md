As we have seen above, and will see again below, the *Nārāyaṇīya* \(MBh 12.321-339\) has played a crucial role in the self-understanding of later Pāñcarātra traditions. 

Within the last fifteen years or so, scholarship on this text has been dominated by the German language volume *Nārāyaṇīya-Studien *\(1997\), the outcome of a collaborative project undertaken by Reinhold Grünendahl, Angelika Malinar, Thomas Oberlies and Peter Schreiner. The contributions of these scholars are briefly summarised in an English language introduction to the volume by Schreiner \(1997a\), who writes near the beginning \(ibid: 1\): 

Even the most cursory survey of the whole Nārāyaṇīya reveals that the text is divided into two parts \(part A and part B, in our terminology\). Part A comprises chapters 321-326 and is a complex sequence of emboxed narratives. Part B is a sequence of separate units only loosely connected. Redactional devices like the change of dialogue setting and cross references suggest that part B is later than part A… \[As\] a whole the text cannot have taken shape long before the final redaction of the Mahābhārata, i.e. before the 4th-5th century A.D. 

The contributions of Oberlies \(1997, 1997a, 1997b\) to this volume identify the 

“emboxed narratives” which comprise the first six chapters as distinct textual units or 

“layers”, the composition of which can be arranged chronologically. The basic framework \(Grundgerüst\) of part A concerns Nārada’s journey to White Island \( *śvetadvīpa*\), his recitation of a *stotra*, and his subsequent vision of, and short conversation with, Nārāyaṇa. To this core narrative, other loosely connected tales and dialogues were subsequently added \(Oberlies 1997: 87\). Meanwhile, the lack of homogeneity in the following chapters \(12.327-339\), redacted after the completion of part A, and collectively referred to as part B, is demonstrated in one place or another in the essays of Grünendahl, Malinar and Schreiner. [[179]]

This general picture of the *Nārāyaṇīya*’s heterogeneous composition has been subject to detailed criticism and rejection by Hiltebeitel \(2006\), who holds that the composition of the MBh as a whole occurred within “at most two generations sometime between 150 BCE and the year zero” \(ibid: 227\).291 I am not competent to enter into the debate, not least because I am not working from manuscript sources. 

However, on the basis that any scholar now working on the *Nārāyaṇīya* is obliged, at least implicitly, to “take sides”, as it were, in the following I shall *explicitly* accept the general conclusions relating to the text’s composition which are contained in *Nārāyaṇīya-Studien*. Accordingly, I adopt that work’s principal hermeneutical policy of separating chapters 321-326, henceforth “Part A”, from chapters 327-339, “Part B”. This approach to the text is preferable to Hiltebeitel’s, to my mind, because it can much more easily explain the *Nārāyaṇīya*’s numerous discontinuities, inconsistencies and contradictions, and its generally disjointed narrative. I am fundamentally in agreement with Schreiner’s \(1997a: 15\) description of the *Nārāyaṇīya* as a “puzzling labyrinth”, and some of these inconsistencies etc. will be addressed below. 

Among the multiple characters, place names, themes and technical vocabularies which later Pāñcarātra authors appear to have borrowed from the *Nārāyaṇīya*, the vision of the idealised, prototypical Ekāntin worshippers has been one of the more persistent. But who are the Ekāntins in the *Nārāyaṇīya*? In his commentary on the MBh, called *Bhāratabhāvadīpa* \(BhBhD\), the seventeenth century Sanskrit scholar Nīlakaṇṭha Caturdhara identified the Ekāntins as “devotees without desires” 

\( *niṣkāmabhaktāḥ*\).292 While this characterisation cannot be said to be inaccurate, as I will demonstrate below, it is certainly insufficient. Ekāntins are described and referred to in both parts of the *Nārāyaṇīya*, and a close analysis of the relevant passages reveals the emergence of a number of new ideas in the later portions of Part A, and in Part B. These concern both the practice of the Ekāntins, and the means by which they are distinguished from other worshippers. In Part B especially, the 291 Hiltebeitel’s general position on the composition of the MBh has itself been subject to criticism by Fitzgerald \(2003\) among others.

Ekāntins are often described in purely abstract terms, as the perfect human beings. 

As Vaiśaṃpāyana says to Janamejaya: “Persons that are Ekāntins are very rare, O 

King. If the world were filled with Ekāntins, O son of the Kurus, \[who are\] non-violent, know the Self, are intent upon the welfare of all beings, are free from actions motivated by desire, the Kṛta Age would be reached \[again\]\!”293 However, the term *ekāntin * is also applied to particular persons, for example to the seer \( *ṛṣi*\) Nārada, whose story comprises the oldest text layer of Part A, and who is a prominent character in several chapters in Part B. Also present in both parts of the text are the fantastical “White Men”, the paradigmatic Ekāntins who inhabit White Island: *kṣīrodadher uttarataḥ śvetadvīpo mahāprabhaḥ*// *tatra nārāyaṇaparā*

*mānavāś candravarcasaḥ*/ *ekāntabhāvopagatās te bhaktāḥ puruṣottamam*// 

*te sahasrārciṣaṃ devaṃ praviśanti sanātanam*/ *atīndriyā nirāhārā aniṣpandāḥ*

*sugandhinaḥ*// *ekāntinas te puruṣāḥ śvetadvīpanivāsinaḥ*/. - “North of the Milk Ocean, shining brilliantly, is White Island. The people there, devoted to Nārāyaṇa, are the colour of the moon. Those devotees of the Supreme Person have attained the state of *ekānta*. They enter the eternal, thousand-rayed god. 

\[Existing in a state in which\] the sense faculties are transcended, without \[the need for\] food, motionless, sweet-smelling, those persons who live on White Island are Ekāntins.” \(MBh 12.323.23c-26b\) 

In the simplest terms, as expressed here and elsewhere \(e.g. 337.67\), Ekāntins are those who have attained the state of *ekānta *\( *ekāntabhāva*\). This is sometimes identified as a mental state \( *ekāntagatabuddhi*, 326.96, 331.50\). At 326.96 this mental state is declared to be a prerequisite for attaining a vision of god. The various descriptions and implications of the state of *ekānta * are the focus of my attention in the following part of this chapter, where I scrutinise the term *ekānta * itself. 

Thereafter, I address the “religious identity” of the Ekāntins, paying particular attention to the ways in which they are distinguished from other worshippers. 

[^293]: MBh 12.336.57e-58: *ekāntino hi puruṣā durlabhā bahavo nṛpa*/// *yady ekāntibhir ākīrṇaṃ jagat syāt kurunandana*/ *ahiṃsakair ātmavidbhiḥ sarvabhūtahite rataiḥ*// *bhavet kṛtayugaprāptir āśīḥkarmavivarjitaiḥ*///. [[181]]
