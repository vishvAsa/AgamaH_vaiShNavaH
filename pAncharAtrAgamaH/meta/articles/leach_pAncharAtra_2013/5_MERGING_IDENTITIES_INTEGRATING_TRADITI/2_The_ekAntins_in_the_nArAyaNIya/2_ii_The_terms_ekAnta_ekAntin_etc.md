title = "2 ii \\) The terms ekānta, ekāntin etc"

+++

In the context of the *Nārāyaṇīya*, several modern scholars \(e.g. Bhandarkar 1913: 6, Gonda 1977: 9, Matsubara 1994: 51 *ff*\) have understood the terms *ekānta* and *ekāntin* to denote primarily “monotheism”. However, although the exclusive worship of Hari-Nārāyaṇa, also called Viṣṇu and Vāsudeva, certainly appears to be one of the key meanings of *ekānta* and its related terms in several passages belonging to *Part B*, there is little justification for the claim that this is the primary sense of these terms throughout the *Nārāyaṇīya* as a whole. In the following I will argue that, as used in the *Nārāyaṇīya*, the terms *ekānta* etc. are multivalent, and that the text itself quite explicitly invites this interpretation. It is worth noting here that I am in agreement on this issue, at least in principle, with Vedāntadeśika, who himself stressed the multiple meanings of the term *ekāntin*.294 In sorting through the various, and concurrent, senses of *ekānta* and its related terms in the *Nārāyaṇīya*, I will draw attention to three in particular, and argue that each of these can be more significant to a preliminary understanding of the identity of the Ekāntins than is the characteristic of monotheism. Only in certain portions of Part B, moreover, does “monotheism” \(i.e. 

the worship of a Vaiṣṇava deity to the exclusion of other deities, Brahmā and Śiva in particular\) appear to supplant one of the three senses that I call attention to. **

It should be stated at the outset that I am not the first to question the validity of interpreting *ekānta* etc. in the *Nārāyaṇīya* as referring primarily to “monotheism”. 

Already in the middle of the nineteenth century, in his monumental *Indische Alterthumskunde* the Norwegian scholar Christian Lassen, a former student and colleague of August Wilhelm von Schlegel at the University of Bonn, rendered *ekāntagatabuddhi* \(used to describe Nārada at MBh 12.326.96d\) as “seinen Geist auf einen gewissen Gegenstand gerichtet hatte”, asserting in a footnote that the literal meaning of *ekānta* is “was einem einzigen Ausgang hat, also was sicher ist.” Lassen \(1852: 1104 n. 5\) concluded that *ekāntin * does not therefore mean “monotheist” 

\(“Ekāntin bedeutet demnach nicht eigentlich Monotheist”\). While I do not share 294 PRR 139.4 *ff*: *ekatra anto niścayaḥ prāpyatayā prāpakatayā ca… tatrāpy ananyopāyatvānanyapra-yojanatvayoḥ samuccayāt pāramyam* / *ananyapāyatvaṃ ca ananyadevatākatvaparyantam*. [[182]]

Lassen’s belief that we can do away with the sense of monotheism altogether, this is nonetheless an instructive reading. As with Vedāntadeśika before him, Lassen finds in the term *ekānta * a reference to the means by which a certain goal is attained, and a reference to the nature of the goal itself. The latter, according to Lassen, is both singular and certain. 

These represent, in my view, two of the primary senses of *ekānta* in the *Nārāyaṇīya*: the single-minded concentration on a Vaiṣṇava deity \(normally called Hari or Nārāyaṇa\), and the outcome \(i.e. liberation, *mokṣa*\) which is certain to ensue from such a practice. In the first of these senses, the term *ekānta* is similar in meaning, as Brockington \(2003: 18\) has observed, to the term *ekāgra*, which refers to “one-pointed” concentration. The adjectival compound *ekāgra * is used in several places in the MBh as “a general term of commendation” \(ibid.\), but it also occurs, especially in the *Mokṣadharmaparvan*, as the name for a technique adopted in meditation. Thus, at MBh 12.188.5, during an explanation of the fourfold “yoga of meditation” \( *dhyānayoga*\), we read, in the translation of Bronkhorst \(1993: 68-69\): 

“A sage, sitting like a piece of wood, bundling his senses together, should fix his mind \[so that it becomes\] one-pointed and held together as a result of recitation, on that”.295 Elsewhere, a description of the practice of yoga \( *yogakṛtya*\) contains a reference to performing “one-pointedness of the mind and senses” \( *manasaś cendriyāṇāṃ ca kṛtvaikāgryaṃ*, MBh 12.232.13ab, see also 24c\), while at MBh 12.294.8, meditation \( *dhyāna*\) is said to consist of one-pointedness of the mind \( *ekāgratā ca manasaḥ*\) and restraint of the breath \( *prāṇāyāma*\).296 As well as being explicitly associated with the practice of yoga \(see also 12.304.23, and *Bhagavadgītā* 

6.12a\) and meditation \( *dhyāna*, see also 12.198.6\), one-pointedness is also linked to 295 MBh 12.188.5: *tatra svādhyāyasaṃśliṣṭam ekāgraṃ dhārayen manaḥ*/ *piṇḍīkṛtyendriyagrāmam āsīnaḥ kāṣṭhavan muniḥ*//. Cf. Wynne \(2009: 189\), working from the Bombay edition: “In those places, the silent sage should sit as still as a piece of wood and bring his sense faculties together. Then he should keep his mind one-pointed, and steeped in meditation \( *tatra dhyānena saṃśliṣṭam ekāgraṃ*

*dhārayen manaḥ*\).” Both Bronkhorst \(1993: 70-71\) and Wynne \(2007: 29\) note that the passage containing this verse borrows ideas and nomenclature from Buddhist accounts of the four *dhyāna* s. 

[^296]: Ten chapters further on in the *Mokṣadharmaparvan* \(12.304.8-10\), the highest practice of yoga \( *yogakṛtya*\) is said to consist of “fixing the mind” \( *dhāraṇā*\) and restraining the breath \( *prāṇāyāma*\). 

It is likely that “one-pointedness” was understood, at least in some circles, in much the same way as 

“fixing the mind”. This is confirmed by the star passage \*775 immediately following 12.304.9ab: *ekāgratā ca manasaḥ prāṇāyāmas tathaiva ca*/. [[183]]

the practice of “recitation” \( *svādhyāya* at 12.188.5, *japa * at 12.192.16\) and to asceticism \( *tapas*, e.g. 3.246.25 and 12.242.4\).297 In the *Nārāyaṇīya*, one-pointedness is also linked with *japa *\(12.323.32, 325.2-3\) and with *tapas *\(327.41\), and it is attributed to Nārada as he practises “all austerities” \( *sarvakṛcchradharaḥ*, 325.2d\) having arrived at White Island. In this latter passage, the description of Nārada shares several features with certain descriptions of the Ekāntin inhabitants of White Island, who also have “one-pointed minds” \( *ekāgramanastvena*, 323.32e\). Further on, it is said: 

*ime hy anindriyāhārā madbhaktāś candravarcasaḥ*/ *ekāgrāś cintayeyur māṃ*

*naiṣāṃ vighno bhaved iti*// *siddhāś caite mahābhāgāḥ purā hy ekāntino*

*’bhavan*/ *tamorajovinirmuktā māṃ pravekṣyanty asaṃśayam*//. – “These 

\[White Men\] are without \(i.e. they have transcended\) the sense faculties and \[the need for\] food, are devoted to me, and are the colour of the moon. There should be no interruption for them – they should \[be able to\] direct their thoughts upon me one-pointedly. These perfected, illustrious beings became Ekāntins long ago. 

Freed from *rajas* and *tamas*, they will undoubtedly enter into me.” \(MBh 12.326.18-19\) 

Ekāntins are repeatedly characterised by their intense, single-minded concentration.298 They are focussed on one object only. According to Vedāntadeśika \(PRR 139.4\), the *anta* in *ekānta* refers to a *niścaya*, a “definite ascertainment”, which is *ekatra*, “in one place”, or in other words, of one particular object. Nīlakaṇṭha, meanwhile, in his commentary on the MBh, glosses *ekāntagatabuddhibhiḥ* \(at MBh 12.331.50b\) with *avyabhicaritabuddhibhiḥ*, literally “with undeviating minds”. In the opening chapter of the *Nārāyaṇīya *\(12.321\), the object of this concentrated attention is the inner self \( *antarātman*\) of all beings, called the knower of the field \( *kṣetrajña*, 29ab\), and Ekāntins are said to be “absorbed in that” \( *tadbhāvitā*, 12.321.42ab\). 

Elsewhere, they are described as being absorbed in *brahman* \( *brahmabhāva*, 323.45d\), and intensely concentrated \( *susamāhita*, 326.116\). More commonly, the object of their focussed attention is a personal god called Nārāyaṇa or Hari. It is, I 297 One-pointedness \( *ekaggatā*/ *ekāgratā*\) also has an important place in Buddhist meditation \(see e.g. 

Cousins 1992\) and in Pātañjala yoga \(see especially *Yogasūtra* 3.11-12\). 

[^298]: The star passage \*813 immediately following 12.323.42ab articulates this well. The two half- *ślokas* 323.42ab-\*813 together read: “By those men who are Ekāntins, knowers of the Five Times, yoked with supreme devotion, Hari is then worshipped in thought, word, and deed” \( *tair iṣṭaḥ*

*pañcakālajñair harir ekāntibhir naraiḥ*/ *bhaktyā paramayā yuktair manovākkarmabhis tadā *\*\). [[184]]

propose, this intensely concentrated mental attitude which is referred to by the phrase *ekāntabhāva* \(at e.g. 322.4d, 323.24c, and 326.116c\). Those who have “attained the state of *ekānta*” \( *ekāntabhāvopagatā*\), we are told at 332.18, have minds that are concentrated and controlled, their senses are restrained, and they enter into Vāsudeva.299 

This brings me to the second of the three primary senses of *ekānta* and related terms in the *Nārāyaṇīya*. As Lassen notes, the adjective *ekānta* also can also be used to describe something which has only one outcome \(“Ausgang”\) or “end” \(i.e. *anta*\). 

Lassen \(1852: 1104 n. 5\) remarks that this is the meaning of *ekānta* in the “Sāṃkhya system”, by which he no doubt means the tradition/s which composed, and later commented upon, the *Sāṃkhyakārikā *\(SK\). In this work, the terms *ekānta *\(SK 1\) and *aikāntika* \(SK 68\) are found alongside, respectively, *atyanta* and *ātyantika*, the former terms denoting “certainty” and the latter terms “finality” or “permanence” \(of the “isolation”, *kaivalya*, of *puruṣa* from *prakṛti* at SK 68\).300 The two terms appear to be close enough in meaning in the SK so as to be virtually synonymous \(see e.g. 

Larson 1969: 257, 280; Jacobsen 2002: 6, 275\), a semantic feature which is also found, for instance, in the *Bhagavadgītā *\(cf. 6.21a, 28d with 14.27d\). This use of the word *ekānta * to denote a type of “certainty” echoes the primary sense of *ekānta * and its related terms in the philosophical literature: an argument that is *aikāntika* is one which leads to a single and therefore a certain or definite conclusion, while one which is *anekānta* or *anaikāntika* leads to more than one conclusion, and so is 

“inconclusive” or “uncertain” \(Randle 1930: 192-194\). Outside of the philosophical context, *ekānta* can also refer more generally to something which is “absolutely” or 

“exclusively” the case, and on several occasions in his translation of the first two books of the *Śāntiparvan*, Fitzgerald \(2004\) translates *ekānta* with these words.301 

[^299]: MBh 12.332.18: *samāhitamanaskāś ca niyatāḥ saṃyatendriyāḥ*/ *ekāntabhāvopagatā vāsudevaṃ*

*viśanti te*//. 

[^300]: In his *Bhāṣya* on the *Sāṃkhyakārikā*, Gauḍapāda \(p. 2\) glosses *ekānta * with *avaśyam*, meaning 

“necessarily, inevitably, certainly, at all events, by all means” \(Monier-Williams 2002: 104\). In his *Vṛtti* on SK 68, the later commentator Māṭhara glosses *aikāntikam * with *avaśyambhāvitvāt*, literally 

“because of it being necessarily the case”. 

[^301]: See Fitzgerald’s \(2004\) translations of e.g. MBh 12.13.8a, 19.18a, 81.10a, 128.15a, 137.24c. [[185]]

In one place in the *Nārāyaṇīya*, we find the term *ekāntitvam * alongside *atyanta*,302 which may point to the validity of interpreting *ekānta* etc. as denoting, among other things, a kind of “certainty”. The kind of certainty that is applicable to Ekāntins regards their own liberation, which in this text commonly takes the form of entering into god.303 We are repeatedly told throughout the *Nārāyaṇīya* that Ekāntins, i.e. those who have attained the state of *ekānta*, are assured of entering into god, or of going to the “highest place” etc.304 On several occasions \(e.g. at 12.326.19, translated above, and at 326.44\), the liberation of the Ekāntins is referred to in the future tense, suggesting that the state of *ekānta* \( *ekāntabhāva*\) may represent a stage prior to final liberation. This would explain why the state of *ekānta* is so commonly referred to as something that is “attained”, “arrived at” or “entered into”.305 And if liberation is guaranteed to those who reach this stage, as is repeatedly stated, this would explain, for example, Nārada’s calling the “White Men” “awakened” \( *pratibuddha*, 331.41c, 51b\), and Yudhiṣṭhira’s referring to them as being already “liberated here” \( *vimuktā*

*bhavantīha*, 322.14a\). As Schreiner \(1997b: 178\) observes, this may be an articulation of the idea that was later called “liberation while living” \( *jīvanmukti*\). At any rate, it is clear that, for the authors of the *Nārāyaṇīya*, Ekāntins have already undergone a significant transformation of some sort, and that this sets them apart from non-Ekāntins. This transformation is conveyed, metaphorically, by the extraordinary physical appearance of the inhabitants of White Island \(described at e.g. 322.9-11\) or, as in the following less dramatic example from the *phalaśruti* which closes Part A, by the fact that Ekāntins take on the colour or the “radiance” of the moon: 

*yaś cedaṃ paṭhate nityaṃ yaś cedaṃ śṛṇuyān naraḥ*/ *ekāntabhāvopagata ekānte susamāhitaḥ*// *prāpya śvetaṃ mahādvīpaṃ bhūtvā candraprabho naraḥ*

[^302]: MBh 12.334.1: “Having heard this speech proclaimed by Nara and Nārāyaṇa, Nārada was completely devoted to god, and attained the status of an Ekāntin” \( *śrutvaitan nārado vākyaṃ*

*naranārāyaṇeritam*/ *atyantabhaktimān deve ekāntitvam upeyivān*//\). 

[^303]: That “entering into god” signifies “liberation” is asserted at 12.326.24ab: *yaṃ praviśya bhavantīha muktā vai dvijasattama*/. See also the very similar 326.41ab, and elsewhere 327.6. 

[^304]: Indeed, mention of the Ekāntins is *usually* accompanied by this assertion. See e.g. MBh 12.321.41-42; 326.19; 326.44; 332.18; 336.3c-4; 336.69; 337.67. 

[^305]: The most common way to articulate this is with the term *upagata* \(see MBh 12.323.24c, 326.116c, 332.18c, and 337.67c\). Elsewhere, *samāgata* \(323.49b\) and *upeyivas *\(334.1d\) are also used. [[186]]

/ *sa sahasrārciṣaṃ devaṃ praviśen nātra saṃśayaḥ*//. – “A man who regularly recites and listens to this, in a solitary place, intensely concentrated, \[by him\] the state of *ekānta* is attained. After reaching the great White Island and having become a man with the radiance of the moon \(i.e. a “White Man”\), he shall undoubtedly enter into the thousand-rayed god.” \(MBh 12.326.116-117\) This passage conveniently points to the third of what I am calling the three 

“primary senses” of *ekānta* while also conveying the two other senses that I have highlighted above. The use of the term *ekānta* to refer to a secluded or solitary place is common throughout the epic \(see e.g. MBh 1.21.4c, 3.49.3a, 3.137.5a, 12.215.8d\). 

Frequently, such places are inhabited by renunciates performing acts of asceticism \( *tapas*\) \(e.g. MBh 1.32.4, 1.110.30-35, 1.208.16 *ff* etc.\). Indeed, on several occasions in the *Śāntiparvan*, the term *ekāntaśīlin*, literally “practising a life of solitude”, implies precisely the practice of renunciation and *tapas*.306 In the *Nārāyaṇīya*, shortly after Nārada has listed his personal qualities and achievements \(among which he counts *ekāntabhāva*, 12.322.3-4\), the vantage point at the summit of Mount Meru from which he first sets eyes on White Island and its Ekāntin inhabitants is described as “secluded” \( *ekāntam*, 322.7b\). Given the prevalence of this use of *ekānta* in the MBh, and in the *Śāntiparvan* in particular, it seems reasonable to suggest that we should include this sense of the term and its implications in our preliminary understanding of the identity of the Ekāntins in the *Nārāyaṇīya*. After all, Ekāntins are repeatedly described as inhabiting a place \(i.e. White Island\) which is far removed from the ordinary world. As Nīlakaṇṭha emphasises in his commentary, Ekāntins have renounced all desires \(e.g. 328.30, 336.27-29\), though they remain desirous of liberation \(336.67\). They are called ascetics \( *yati*, 336.79c\), and are 306 See MBh 12.9.4-11, where Yudhiṣṭhira describes the life he will live as a forest hermit. The key verses, for the present purposes, are translated by Fitzgerald \(2004: 185\) as follows: “Abandoning the way of life and the comforts of society, enduring tremendous ascetic observances, I shall live in the forest… Enduring cold, wind, and heat, tolerating hunger, thirst, and fatigue, I shall dry my body up with the heat of the ascetic practices that are prescribed… Living all alone \( *ekāntaśīlin*, 10a\), reflecting upon matters… I will await the dissolution of this body.” See also 12.23.8-9b \(ibid.: 214\): 

“Asceticism, sacrifice, learning, begging alms, the restraint of the senses, meditation, a life of solitude \( *ekāntaśīlatva*\), contentment, and making donations - all according to one’s ability – these actions are the approved means to complete perfection for brahmins.” Elsewhere, see 12.21.9, 12.288.29, and 12.304.12. With regard to this last verse, it should be noted that Hopkins \(1901: 342\) and Brockington \(2003: 17\) interpret *ekāntaśīlinā * as, respectively, “devoted to one thing”, and “devoted to one purpose”. See also MBh 14.19.14-30, wherein *ekāntaśīla* is linked with the teaching or discipline of yoga \( *yogaśāstra*\). [[187]]

characterised as having transcended the sense faculties and the need for food \(322.9ab, 323.25cd\). Nārada, himself an Ekāntin, practises *tapas* or “austerities” 

\(322.3b, 325.2d\), and says that his vision of Nārāyaṇa is the “fruit” of these practices, alongside his restraint \( *yama*\) and piety \( *niyama*\) \(326.15\). On two occasions in later passages of Part A, and in several passages belonging to Part B, this renunciate way of life is subsumed under the general category of 

“disengagement” or withdrawal from activity \( *nivṛtti*\).307 At 327.61-66, this practice of *nivṛtti*, literally “turning away” from action, is associated with the traditions of Sāṃkhya and Yoga, and with the teaching \( *śāstra*\) and *dharma * of liberation \( *mokṣa*\). 

It is contrasted here with the path of ritual action, namely *pravṛtti*, which is practised by those who “know the Veda”.308 

Of course, each of the three senses of *ekānta* which I have highlighted here are closely related to one another, and at times their connotations overlap. So, for instance, the first and third senses both point to the practice of asceticism, the first by drawing attention to a meditative technique which was apparently well-established within certain ascetic milieux, the latter by evoking the solitary environments in which such techniques were commonly practised. The first and second senses, meanwhile, could be said to be even closer in that they both ultimately concern Nārāyaṇa: in the first sense as the object of contemplation, and in the second sense as the certain “end” to which this contemplation leads. Needless to say, my reasons for distinguishing *between* senses in the above manner are purely expositional. They do not reflect a strict hermeneutical method, but are merely intended to highlight what I consider to be the most important connotations of the term we are presently occupied with. It should be noted here, before we move on, that the senses of *ekānta* listed above have much in common with those connected to the term *ekāyana*, as discussed in the last chapter.309 

[^307]: MBh 12.326.63ab: “It is known that the supreme *nivṛtti* is the extinction of all duties” \( *nirvāṇaṃ*

*sarvadharmāṇāṃ nivṛttiḥ paramā smṛtā*\). 

[^308]: Hiltebeitel \(2011: 254\) writes: “Literally, *pravṛtti* means the “act of rolling onwards” or “turning outwards,” implying modes of engagement with the world consonant with dharmashastric norms”. 

Bailey \(1985\) offers a thorough discussion of the concepts *nivṛtti * and *pravṛtti*. 

[^309]: Among the meanings of *ekānta * given by Monier-Williams \(2002: 230\) we find “a lonely or retired or secret place”, “the only end or aim”, “devotion to one object”, “directed towards or devoted to only 188 

I have referred above to the prospect of a “preliminary understanding” of the identity of the Ekāntins, which now needs to be explained. Each of the senses of the term *ekānta* to which I have drawn attention can be found in passages which Oberlies \(1997, 1997a, 1997b\) has identified as belonging to the older portions of Part A. 

Bearing in mind that the * Nārāyaṇīya * contains multiple “layers”, i.e. sections which have been added to the core narrative \(concerning Nārada’s journey to White Island and his vision of god\), we should expect to find a number of new ideas and new points of emphasis in these younger sections, and indeed we do. Nārada’s vision of Nārāyaṇa \(described at 326.2-9\), which belongs to the *oldest* layer of the text, appears to be the consequence of, or the reward for, his singing a hymn of praise \( *stotra*\) with his mind “one-pointed” \( *ekāgramanāḥ*\). Nārada has achieved this “one-pointedness” through performing *japa* and austerities alongside the White Men on White Island.310 In layers of the text added subsequently, the practices of *japa*, asceticism and one-pointedness are, in one place or another, all presented as being central to the Ekāntin worship of god, and the latter is repeatedly declared to be the prerequisite for a *vision* of god. However, in the later additions to Part A, and in Part B, there is increasingly less emphasis on the meditative and ascetic practices referred to above, and a much greater stress on the idea of gratifying god by means of *bhakti*.311 

Thus, in the story of King Vasu’s *aśvamedha*, Vasu is rewarded with a vision of the Bhagavat not because he is an Ekāntin, but because god is pleased that his sacrifice involved no animal slaughter \(323.10-11\). At the end of this section, Vasu affirms that it is possible to see god only as a consequence of his kindness \( *yasya prasādaṃ kurute sa vai taṃ draṣṭum arhati*, 323.18ef\). Meanwhile, one of the main one object or person”, and “monotheistic doctrine”. Apte’s \(1988: 121\) entries, meanwhile, include 

“solitary”, “directed towards one point or object only”, “a lonely or retired place”, and “exclusive aim”. These are echoed in both dictionaries by the entries under ‘ *ekāyana*’: “absolute devotedness to one” \(Monier-Williams ibid.\), “a lonely or retired place”, “monotheism”, and “the sole object” \(Apte ibid.\). 

[^310]: MBh 12.325.1-3: *prāpya śvetaṃ mahādvīpaṃ nārado bhagavān ṛṣiḥ*/ *dadarśa tān eva narāñ* *śvetāṃś candraprabhāñ śubhān*// *pūjayām āsa śirasā manasā taiś ca pūjitaḥ*/ *didṛkṣur* *japyaparamaḥ sarvakṛcchradharaḥ sthitaḥ*// *bhūtvaikāgramanā vipra ūrdhvabāhur mahāmuniḥ*/ 

*stotraṃ jagau sa viśvāya nirguṇāya mahātmane*//. 

[^311]: The term *bhakti* is used at MBh 12.322.12, which may or may not belong to the oldest layer of the text \(Oberlies 1997: 91\). *Bhakti* and *bhakta* etc. are found much more frequently in the later portions of Part A, especially those which narrate the stories of King Vasu. [[189]]

themes in the following tale of the brothers Ekata, Dvita and Trita \(323.19-53\), which appears to be among the later additions to Part A, is that asceticism \( *tapas*\) does *not* lead to a vision of god. The brothers practise traditional methods of asceticism for thousands of years in order to see Nārāyaṇa \(323.19-21\), but are subsequently told that it is not possible for a non-devotee \( *abhakta*\) to see him \(323.48cd\). The following verse appears to equate being a devotee with being an Ekāntin,312 and it is striking that earlier on in this section the White Men, the paradigmatic Ekāntins, are described as practising one-pointedness and *japa* \(323.32\), but not *tapas*. It should also be noted here that the White Men are depicted as worshipping god with heavenly flowers and herbs \( *puṣpāṇi*… *cauṣadhīḥ*, 323.41cd\), which represents a significant departure from the historically earlier descriptions of Ekāntin worship. This move away from asceticism is also evident in another of the apparently youngest portions of Part A. In a verse in the *Nārāyaṇīya*’s opening chapter, we are told that “to see \[Nara and Nārāyaṇa\] by means of asceticism and ardour is difficult even for the gods. \[Only\] he to whom they bestow kindness can see both gods.”313 The theme continues in a short passage in chapter 331. Here it is said that god is not seen by asceticism \( *tapasāpi na dṛśyo hi* *bhagavān*, 331.12a\), and that Nārada’s viewing of god on White Island was manifested, rather, in consequence of god’s kindness \( *devaprasādānugataṃ vyaktaṃ*

*tat tasya darśanam*, 331.14ab\). 

This tendency away from asceticism and towards an emphasis on god’s kindness or favour \( *prasāda*\) is evident in sections of Part A which have been identified by the scholars of *Nārāyaṇīya-Studien * as being among the later additions to chapters 321-326. The trend coincides with an increasing emphasis on the reciprocal, loving relationship between god and his devotees, called *bhakti*. 

However, the practice of asceticism is not excluded from this new paradigm. Rather, its efficacy is reinterpreted within a *bhakti* framework which emphasises the greater 312 MBh 12.323.48c-49: *na sa śakyo abhaktena draṣṭuṃ devaḥ kathaṃ cana*// *kāmaṃ kālena mahatā*

*ekāntitvaṃ samāgataiḥ*/ *śakyo draṣṭuṃ sa bhagavān prabhāmaṇḍaladurdṛśaḥ*//.

power of god’s benevolence.314 Two examples from Part B ably demonstrate this method. In the first, Vyāsa declares that he has practised very severe asceticism so that he might know the past, present and future. While practising these austerities on the shore of the Milk Ocean, he says, this knowledge relating to the three times was revealed to him by means of god’s kindness.315 In the second example, Rudra claims that his asceticism and study, or recitation of texts \( *svādhyāya*\), is prosperous only on account of god’s kindness.316 Passages such as these articulate a rejection of the idea that ascetic practices \(and in the latter example, Vedic study\) are intrinsically efficacious. According to this historically later view, then, any kind of religious achievement is ultimately dependent upon god rather than the worshipper. This is expressed very clearly in chapter 336: “The person who is seen by Nārāyaṇa shall be awakened. Thus, one is not awakened by one’s own desires, O king.”317 As Schreiner \(1997b: 164-165\) remarks, this represents a complete inversion of the older idea of the vision of god. 

In the context of this kind of teaching, it was inevitable that meditative practices such as one-pointedness, which were previously considered to be themselves innately powerful,318 would be subordinated entirely to practices which aimed solely towards the gratification of god. It was, I propose, in this context that the term *ekānta* came to explicitly denote a monotheism. This sense is never explicit in Part A, wherein the Ekāntins are distinguished from non-Ekāntins primarily by their intensely concentrated \(“one-pointed”\) form of worship. In the story of Ekata, Dvita and Trita, for example, it is not indicated that the brothers fail to achieve a vision of god because they are not monotheists. However, the tale of Vasu’s liberation from a hole in the earth \(324.17-38\), which appears to have been added to 314 The notion of “renunciation” was also reinterpreted, along the lines of the teaching of renunciation in the *Bhagavadgītā*. This has already been adequately discussed in the secondary literature, see especially Malinar \(1997\).

[^318]: Of course, such practices still *were* considered to be innately powerful by certain other religious groups. [[191]]

Part A after the story of Ekata, Dvita and Trita \(Oberlies 1997: 112\), offers a striking prologue to ideas which will be taken up at greater length in Part B. For here \(324.27-33\), Vasu is liberated from the hole not by his own actions, but by the command of god, who is pleased \( *tuṣṭa*\) by Vasu’s constant worship \( *pūjā*\). As Grünendahl \(2002: 327\) notes, Vasu’s liberation “seems to have \[been\] regarded as a prototype of the god’s intervention on behalf of his devotees”. This passage is especially important to the present discussion since it contains the only explicit reference to “monotheism” in the whole of Part A. Although Vasu is never called an Ekāntin, he is referred to here as an *ananyabhakta* \(324.29c\), a “devotee of no other”. 

It was, then, precisely in this *bhakti* context, wherein the devotee is liberated by god rather than by himself, that monotheism, or “exclusive devotion”, became one of the primary means by which to distinguish Ekāntins from other worshippers. This method of discrimination, which is new to Part B, is demonstrated quite clearly in a passage from chapter 328 \(30-32d\). Here it is said that for Ekāntins, the most excellent devotees, “there are no other gods” \( *ananyadevatāḥ*\), whereas inferior devotees worship Brahmā, Śiva and “other gods” \( *anyā devatāḥ*\). I discuss this passage in greater detail in the following section, the primary concern of which is this relation between Ekāntins and other worshippers.
