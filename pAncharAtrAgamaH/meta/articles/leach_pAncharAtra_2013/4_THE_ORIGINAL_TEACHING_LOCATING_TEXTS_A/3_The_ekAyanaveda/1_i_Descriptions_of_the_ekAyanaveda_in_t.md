title = "1 i \\) Descriptions of the Ekāyanaveda in the South Indian literature"

+++
I will begin this section with a brief summary of the descriptions of the Ekāyanaveda and its followers that are found in several South Indian works. Since some of these descriptions have been addressed above, and Rastelli \(2006\) has provided a thorough analysis of the material relating to the Ekāyanaveda in its most important testament, the *Pārameśvarasaṃhitā *\(PārS\), I will limit myself here to some brief observations which I hope can provide a useful overview of the Pāñcarātrika tradition of the Ekāyanaveda in twelfth-fourteenth century South India. Subsequently, I will address the term *ekāyana* itself, and explore what the textual evidence can tell us about this Pāñcarātra tradition in earlier centuries. 

Although the existence of an “unauthored” \( *apauruṣeya*\) Ekāyana scripture \( *ekāyanaśruti*\) belonging to a distinct Vedic recension \( *śākhā*\) is found already in Yāmuna’s \(eleventh-twelfth century\) *Āgamaprāmāṇya *\(ĀP\), the earliest explicit references to an ‘Ekāyanaveda’ occur only in the later South Indian scriptural works, namely the PārS and the *Pādmasaṃhitā *\(PādS\). In these texts the Ekāyanaveda is described as the teaching \( *śāstra*\) to which one particular group of Pāñcarātrikas adhere. These Pāñcarātrikas are known as Āgamasiddhāntins or Ekāyanas. The PārS, which is undoubtedly a product of this tradition \(Rastelli 2006\), refers to the tradition of the Ekāyanaveda as the “good” or “true” tradition \( *sadāgama*\), and to the Ekāyanaveda itself as the Ekāntidharma \(1.60a\) and the “root-Veda” or the “original Veda” \( *mūlaveda*\). This latter name reflects the view that the actual Vedas are subordinate teachings. In contrast to the exoteric Vedas which enjoin the worship of multiple deities for various mundane and heavenly rewards, the PārS teaches that the Ekāyanaveda belongs to a “secret tradition” \( *rahasyāmnāya*\), whose members worship only Vāsudeva, especially in his fourfold form \( *cāturātmya*\), and exclusively seek liberation from *saṃsāra*. This juxtaposition, wherein the Vedas are [[133]] presented as a means to achieving lesser rewards \( *bhoga*\), and the Ekāyana tradition is characterised as offering the sole means to the highest goal, can be found already in Yāmuna’s ĀP \(170.3-7\). 

Also consistent with Yāmuna’s account is the PārS’s claim, later incorporated into the predominantly Ekāyana *Īśvarasaṃhitā *\(ĪS\), that the Ekāyanaveda does not have a “personal” \(i.e. human or divine etc.\) origin \( *apauruṣeya*\).[^231] That the Pāñcarātra tradition which claimed allegiance to the Ekāyanaveda considered their foundational teaching to be “uncreated” or “authorless” is also affirmed in the only other extant Pāñcarātra scripture which contains the claim that the *Jayākhyasaṃhitā* \(JS\), *Sātvatasaṃhitā *\(SS\), and *Pauṣkarasaṃhitā *\(PauṣS\) derive from the Ekāyanaveda, namely the *Śrīpraśnasaṃhitā *\(ŚrīprśS\). In the second chapter of this work, the “Pañcarātra *śāstra*” is equated with “the Veda named Ekāyana” \(2.38-41b\) which is said to be “eternal, like the Veda” \( *vedavan nityam*\) \(2.41c\). This position very likely provides an example of Vedāntin theologians, such as Yāmuna and Rāmānuja, having directly influenced scriptural forms of self-presentation. 

According to the PārS \(1.67c-71\), the Ekāyanaveda prescribes sacrifices such as the *aśvamedha*, and it contains all Vedic mantras, as well as teaching the 12 syllabled mantra \(10.139\). It is also said to be characterised by “abstention” or “disengagement” \( *nivṛtti*\). As Rastelli \(2006: 161-168\) shows, the author of the PārS borrows this term, alongside many other terms and motifs \(the most telling of which is the designation *ekāntidharma* for the original teaching itself\), from the *Nārāyaṇīya* section of the *Mahābhārata *\(MBh\), in a deliberate attempt to identify the Ekāyanaveda with the teaching given to Nārada in that text. 

The PādS provides us with several descriptions of the Ekāyana tradition which are valuable because they can afford us some insight into how the Ekāyanas were 

[^231]: PārS 19.524-526b \(→ ĪS 21.561b-563\): *ādyaṃ nityoditavyūhasthāpanādiprakāśakam*/ *apauruṣeyaṃ sadbrahmavāsudevākhyayājinām*// *lakṣyabhūtaṃ dvijendrāṇāṃ hṛdistham adhikāriṇām*/ *brahmopaniṣadākhyaṃ ca divyamantrakriyānvitam*// *vivekadaṃ paraṃ śāstram anicchāto ’pavargadam*/. Rastelli \(2006: 189\) has shown that this passage in the PārS draws heavily on SS 2.4-7b, though the “supreme teaching” in the latter work is not said to be *apauruṣeya*, and nor, as Rastelli points out, is it described as being a *veda* of any sort. It is worth noting that in his commentary on SS 2.4-7b, Alaśiṅgabhaṭṭa equates this “supreme *śastra*” \( *paraṃ śāstram*\) with the *ekāyanaśruti*, and claims that the SS is the “essence” of that \( *ekāyanaśruteḥ sārabhūtaṃ sātvatatantram upadekṣyāmīty*…\).[[134]]regarded by certain other Pāñcarātrikas. 

Of course, we must treat the PādS’s descriptions of the Ekāyanas with a degree of caution, knowing as we do that they are the product of a tradition which apparently competed with the Ekāyanas for the control of public temples. With this in mind, we must pay particular attention to those descriptions of the Ekāyanas in the PādS which are consistent with those found in the PārS and the ĪS, and in portions of other texts, such as the PauṣS, which appear to have been authored by Ekāyanas, and consider these to be in general the more reliable. So, for instance, we have little reason to doubt the accuracy of the PādS’s \( *cp* 21.30-32, 47ab\) claim that the Ekāyanas worship the fourfold form of god \( *caturmūrti*\), since this is also attested to by the Ekāyanas. Also, the claim \( *cp* 21.36cd\) that Ekāyanas perform life-cycle rituals \( *saṃskāra*\) beginning with the impregnation rite \( *niṣeka*\) according to their own system rather than by one or other of the recognised Vedic *śākhā* s, seems to be fairly uncontroversial given that Yāmuna \(ĀP 169.3 *ff*\) states the same, and that no Ekāyana text indicates otherwise. 

We have to treat rather more cautiously the PādS’s \( *cp* 21.53\) claim that Ekāyanas do not need to undergo an initiation ceremony \( *dīkṣā*\), since this is not explicitly stated in the PārS or, as far as I am aware, in any other work. However, as Rastelli \(2006: 193-195\) points out, this ceremony is not described in the PārS, and in one passage from that text \(PārS 13.114c-115\) the devotee is promised a rebirth as an Ekāyana if he successfully performs his duties. The PauṣS also guarantees a superior rebirth as an Ekāyana, or a ‘Tanmaya’ \(36.263c-266b\), as reward for devotion to Nārāyaṇa via the performance of mantra-repetition \( *japa*\) and fire-offerings \( *homa*\). 

In addition, there is a further clue, albeit from outside the South Indian context, that the Ekāyana is a tradition or “lineage” that one is born into, for the Kashmirian Brahmin Vāmanadatta, author of the so-called *Saṃvitprakāśa *\(SP\), claims in the closing verses of each *prakaraṇa* of that work that he was born into the Ekāyana. [^232] So, we may choose to tentatively accept this claim, even if the PādS \( *cp* 21.54ab\) remarks elsewhere that adherents of the triple Veda can enter into the Ekāyana provided that they do not already belong to another Pāñcarātra Siddhānta.

[^232]: SP 1.137c-138b reads: *ekāyane prasūtasya kaśmīreṣu dvijātmanaḥ*// *kṛtir vāmanadattasya seyaṃ bhagavadāśrayā*/. - “Depending on the Lord, this is a work of Vāmanadatta, a Brahmin born in Kashmir into the Ekāyana \[lineage\].” Cf. SP 2.61, 3.60, 4.98, and 5.52. On the title of this work see Sanderson \(2009a\). [[135]] 



With regard to other characterisations of the Ekāyanas which we find in the PādS, we enter more complex territory. For instance the claim \(at *cp* 21.43-46\) that Ekāyanas are not qualified to perform the rites related to the construction of temples and the installation \( *pratiṣṭhā*\) of divine images therein, is contradicted both by the PārS \(15.14c-20 etc.\) and by other works, as we will see below, but this does not necessarily mean that we can therefore dismiss the claim as false. For at the least, the presence of this claim in the PādS indicates that it was accepted by some Pāñcarātrikas. The same can be said for the PādS assertion that Ekāyanas \(as “non-Bhāgavatas”, *abhāgavata*\) are not permitted to perform worship for others \( *parārthayajana*, PādS cp 21.17c-20b\), which is contradicted at e.g. PārS 9.152 \(see Rastelli 2006: 79\), and that they cannot use Vedic mantras \(PādS *cp* 1.37c-39b\), which is also contradicted in several other works, as we will see below. 

Lastly, we turn to the social organisation of the Ekāyana tradition in South India. The PādS \( *cp* 21.39c-40\) claims that the Ekāyanas admit members of all four *varṇa* s. As far as I am aware this is not contradicted anywhere, and it is confirmed by the ĪS which states that the preceptor \( *ācārya*\) may be either Brahmin, Kṣatriya, Vaiśya or Śūdra.[^233] As we will see below, the JS, SS and PauṣS also appear to confirm that Ekāyanas can belong to any of the four *varṇa* s.
