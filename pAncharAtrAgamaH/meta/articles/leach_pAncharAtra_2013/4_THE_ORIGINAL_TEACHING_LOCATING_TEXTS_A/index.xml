      <description>&lt;p&gt;In her monograph on the &lt;em&gt;Paramasaṃhitā&lt;/em&gt;, Marzenna Czerniak-Drożdżowicz (2003: 37-41) asks a pertinent question: how were scriptural claims of divine authorship reconciled with the reality of the situation in which the scriptural texts were being re-worked by successive scholars? “How was such a process of re-working possible?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;she asks. “How could a text which claims to be the faithful record of god’s revelation be subjected to such manipulation?” She finds her answer, at least with regard to the &lt;em&gt;Paramasaṃhitā&lt;/em&gt;, in the text’s admission of multiple lines of transmission: “The admission that the text of a tradition is an intermediate transmission of the revelation opens up the possibility of re-working it”, she writes. “Therefore the attitude towards the text was very special: the text presented the revelation, but as a record of the revelation and not the revelation itself it could be subjected to change.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>
