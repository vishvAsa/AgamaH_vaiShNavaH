      <description>&lt;p&gt;In her illuminating work on the &lt;em&gt;Paramasaṃhitā&lt;/em&gt; (ParS), Czerniak-Drożdżowicz (2003: 35) identifies two main layers of this text:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;i.) an older layer “representing what we may call a tantric way of thinking”, which she also refers to as “the ritualistic corpus”; and&lt;br&gt;&#xA;ii.) a younger layer representing “a more orthodox brahmanical and devotional attitude”.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The latter, at least, was very probably composed in South India (ibid.: 147). Czerniak-Drożdżowicz notes that the account of the ParS’s revelation and transmission, which belongs to the younger layer of the text and which forms the “frame story” of its first and final chapters, explicitly connects the teaching of the ParS with that given in the &lt;em&gt;Nārāyaṇīya&lt;/em&gt;. It does this in a number of ways, including setting the scene of the revelation in the same mythical place, namely White Island ( &lt;em&gt;śvetadvīpa&lt;/em&gt;). As has been mentioned above, we find the same strategy in the opening chapter of the &lt;em&gt;Pārameśvarasaṃhitā&lt;/em&gt;, and it is also present in the *śāstrāvataraṇa * sections of other South Indian works, such as the &lt;em&gt;Īśvarasaṃhitā&lt;/em&gt;, for example, and the &lt;em&gt;Śrīpraśnasaṃhitā&lt;/em&gt;. Grünendahl (see especially 1989: 34 &lt;em&gt;ff&lt;/em&gt;) shows that such strategies are not limited to the Saṃhitās, for they can also be found, for example, in the &lt;em&gt;Viṣṇudharmāḥ&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;Viṣṇurahasya&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Into the reasonably tidy arrangement of, on the one hand, Pāñcarātrikas who claim a Vedic origin for their scriptures, who perform “mixed worship” and who, in some works, refer to their own tradition as the Mantrasiddhānta, and on the other hand, the Ekāyanas or Āgamasiddhāntins, who adhere to the Ekāyanaveda and who claim &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; to be the original scripture from which both the Vedas and the Pāñcarātra Samhitās derive, we encounter the &lt;em&gt;Ahirbudhnyasamhitā&lt;/em&gt; (AS). In this brief section, I provide a summary of the AS’s own account of the “original teaching”, before addressing the question of what this account might be able to tell us about the motivations of the authors of this text, and the kind of Pāñcarātra culture to which they belonged.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the passages summarised above, both the AS and the LT adopt a position which is close to that which we find in the &lt;em&gt;Nārāyaṇīya&lt;/em&gt; itself. In a verse which is subsequently quoted by both Yāmuna (ĀP 133.6-7) and Rāmānuja (see below), the &lt;em&gt;Nārāyaṇīya&lt;/em&gt; presents the ‘Pañcarātra’ as a single inclusive system which contains the “Āraṇyaka of the Vedas”, Sāṃkhya and Yoga as “mutually complementary parts”.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In a&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;sectarian religious context, this attitude of “inclusivism” or “tolerance”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; is normally associated, not unfairly, with the Śaiva tradition of the Mantramārga, and with works such as the &lt;em&gt;Svacchandatantra&lt;/em&gt;, whose appeal that “one should not censure Sāṃkhya, Yoga, the Pāñcarātra and the Veda because they all originate from Śiva, and indeed [all] grant liberation as their fruit”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; was later quoted approvingly by Abhinavagupta in his &lt;em&gt;Tantrāloka&lt;/em&gt; (TĀ).&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Such an approach stands in stark contrast to that adopted by Yāmuna in his ĀP, wherein the Śaiva scriptures ( &lt;em&gt;āgama&lt;/em&gt;), for example, are denounced as being “outside the Veda” ( &lt;em&gt;vedabāhya&lt;/em&gt;), and the only motivation of Rudra, their author, is said to be that of “bewildering” those who are qualified for this “corruption” of the Vedic path.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is not easy to locate the AS and the LT in relation to the other published Pāñcarātra Saṃhitās. There are several clues, as Begley and Sanderson have shown, that both are South Indian in origin, but excepting their prescriptions for the recitation of Vedic and Pāñcarātrika mantras and, in the case of the AS especially, their pronounced leanings towards Brahminical orthodoxy, they are different in many respects to the South Indian scriptural works which I have addressed in previous chapters. Other than a clearly interpolated section of the LT (41.67-68), neither text gives any indication of the Pāñcarātrika sectarianism which appears to have dominated certain South Indian contexts in the 12th and 13th centuries. This may suggest that both works predate this period of sectarian hostility, or that they are products of an area which was not affected by it. It is notable that, in contrast to the majority of South Indian Saṃhitās at my disposal (e.g. the SanS, ViṣS, PādS, NārS, PārS, ĪS, and ViṣṇuS), neither the AS nor the LT make any reference to the Vaikhānasa tradition.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
