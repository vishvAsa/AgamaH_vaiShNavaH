## Major vaiShNava polities and rulers
Most gupta-s were vaiShNava-s (garuDa emblem). Narasimhagupta baladitya who defeated foreigners was also a vaishnava.

The great Mihira Bhoja was a Vaishnava.

Kalanjar was lost to sullas by chandellas but then reclaimed again for them by a trailokyavarman who was supposedly a vaishnava.

rANa kumbha, who wrote a commentary on gIta-govinda and fought Islamic rulers, was vaiShNava. Many sUryavaMshI rAjaputra-s adore rAma most - even if where the family deity is ekalingjI shiva. 

Many vijayanagara rulers were vaiShNava-s. Eg. kRShNadevarAya (a shrIvaiShNava, initiated by Venkata Tatacharya, wrote shrIvaiShNava texts). General gopaNArya was disciple of vedAnta-deshika. 

(Overt Saiva affiliation ended with Sangamas. Devaraya II most probably started as a Saiva (as Sangamas were Saivas) who later seems to have become an Advaitin.)

Gajapatis of Odisha were Vaishnavas and were inveterate enemies of Ms for long. 

voDeya-s of maisUru were shrI-vaiShNava-s (shiShya-s of parakAla-maTha).

mArtANDa varma, who defeated the dutch, was a parama vaishnava. Dharma-rAja rAma-varma who defeated tipu was also a vaishnava. Both sport clear urdhva-puNDra.

shindes of gwalior were vaishnavas. Just look at any depiction of mahadji. 

Raghoji bhonsale was also vaishnava. Raghoji and Murari rao ghorpade became sishyas of uttaradi matha swamiji

## Mass action
shrIrangam defence against Ulugh Khan - thousands of vaiShNava-s sacrificed their lives. AchArya-s rescued idols. Motivated recapture via disciple gopaNArya.

Ramanandi Akhara across the north was probably the most successful militia protection for pilgrims during mughal occupation.

Haryanvi Ramanandi Nirmohi Akhara Bairagis accepted all castes and gave training in both Vedopanishad and martial arts. In Rajasthan, Bairagis were convinced by Sawai Jaisingh to only allow Brahmanas and Kshatriyas and to maintain strict caste distance. Later in, in areas where by military necessity many shudras joined, the raja convinced the Akhara that only shudras would be armed and the brahmanas would give up their arms.

rAm-janma-bhUmi reclamation.

rAdhAramaNadAsa and ISKCON spearheded resistance of Hindus after the 2024 islamist takeover of bangladesh; facing imprisonment and bans.

## Absurd claims and objections
> We have hardly any vaishnav king who fought invaders.  

Refuted above.

> If God can take avtar for one devotee then why can't he appear for 1K devotees?

vaiShNava-s say - He will appear for a prahlAd or draupadI, not ordinary "devotees" like us.
