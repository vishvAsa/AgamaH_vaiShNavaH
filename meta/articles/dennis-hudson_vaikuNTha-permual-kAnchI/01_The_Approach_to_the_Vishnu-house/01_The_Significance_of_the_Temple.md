The two temples of Kanchipuram mentioned in the Introduction dramatically illustrate the religious and political conflict of the time and place, each one built as the personal place of worship by an emperor. Rajasimha articulated his Maheshvara religion majestically in the architecture and sculptures of his palace for Shiva known today as the Kailasanatha Temple. About fifty years later, Nandivarman Pallavamalla responded with his more intimate Vaikuntha Perumal Temple, which is the focus of this study. But a proper understanding of either temple requires some understanding of the rich religious context of the Pallava capital as the eighth century began.

Kanchipuram was a durga or fortress laid out between the Palar River and its branch called Vegavati. A rampart and moat enclosed this durga, penetrated only by guarded gateways. Where the west-east and north-south axes crossed stood its ancient center, which contained the royal palace and the temples for the Goddess \(Kamakkottam\), for Skanda \(Kumarakkottam\) and Trivikrama \(Urakam\), and perhaps a royal Buddhist shrine. The royal processional road \(Raja Street\) surrounded these structures on all four sides. To the west, in the prosperous section called Patakam, stood the temple of Krishna as Messenger of the Pandavas \(Pandavatutar\), and to the north stood the temple of Shiva \(Ekamreshvara\), an important center for Pashupatas. When Rajasimha built the Kailasanatha Temple, he placed it on the city’s western side, facing east. Nandivarman placed his temple on the eastern side, facing west.

Outside the rampart to the south stood Buddhist sites: an Ashoka Stupa about one hundred feet tall, the royal vihara for bhikshus or monks, and probably a shrine for Manimekalai, goddess of the trade routes to Southeast Asia, which by this time were vital to the economy of Pallava rule. A Jain temple stood southwest of the city \(Jaina Kanchi\). To the southeast was the hamlet of Attiyur, which contained temples for Vishnu reclining \(Vehka\), for Vishnu standing with eight arms \(Ashtabhujaswami\), and the hill-like temple for Vishnu carved of the atti or udumbara tree \(Varadarajaswami\). Modern Kanchipuram, however, has changed all this, for the city has spread over the remains of the rampart and moat to incorporate Attiyur and its temples as “Little Kanchi” or “Vishnu Kanchi.”

Kanchipuram’s eighth-century architecture reveals the variety of religions that made it their home because there was wealth to patronize them. Its port of Mamallapuram was a nexus of trade linking Dravida and the Deccan with Sumatra, Java, Champa in Vietnam, China, Cambodia, and Thailand. Wealthy merchants and rulers endowed monasteries and temples to house sadhus or ascetics of all sorts: Maheshvara, Pashupata, Kapalika, Bhagavata; shramana ascetics of Buddhist and Jain sects; and Brahmin sannyasins. Acharyas or scholar priests of different schools of ritual practice called Agamas, and acharyas of different doctrinal systems called Dharmas flourished alongside scholars and poets of a variety of languages. The elite of this city was highly literate, both verbally and visually, which explains why Nandivarman Pallavamalla constructed a Vishnu-house that is virtually a visual summary of Bhagavata Dharma. He addressed it to viewers who must have already known a great deal about the rites and doctrines of their religion, and in sophisticated detail. This is a temple meant not to teach by means of depictions but rather to remind devotees of what they already know. Its design is to use these recollections to transform consciousness, to “awaken” devout viewers to God, who gazes at them from all sides, and from within, wherever they look.

Part of the unfolding discovery of pattern and meaning in the Emperor’s Vishnu-house involves understanding the uniqueness of Nandivarman’s building and the impact it appears to have had on the Bhagavata religion among the Tamils. His temple was a new type for the time: the first completed Bhagavata vimana with three sanctums for worship placed one above the other on three floors. Its paradigm may have been the west-facing temple in Nandipuram near contemporary Kumbhakonam, where an icon sits within a single sanctum and faces west. After Nandivarman had gained final control of his realm he performed a purification ceremony at this Nandipuram temple. Judging from the poem Tirumangai composed to record the event \(*PT* 5.10\), Nandipuram’s west-facing seated icon was believed to embody the two dimensions within God that Nandivarman later brought into view through the reclining and standing icons of his Vishnu-house.

Nandivarman’s architect for his Master’s palace no doubt followed the lead of a scholar of agama \(*agamika*\), and we shall discuss such scholars later. Guided by him, the architect hid the seated icon, and its “internal” dimensions represented by the reclining and standing icons, within the palatial and mountainous vimana. He surrounded it with a drainage pathway that fills with water when the drain is plugged. He enclosed both palace and drainage pathway with the prakara wall on which he had the history of the Pallava Dynasty sculpted, giving prominence to his emperor’s career. In other words, he produced an architectural version of God’s body seen by Brahma as the magnificent “Indra of Earth” known as the mountain Vaikuntha on White Island \(*Shvetadvipa*\) in the Ocean of Milk: “The Bhagavan, who houses the moving and the unmoving, appeared as Earth’s kinsman, the Indra of Earth embraced by waves with a thousand golden peaks as crown and the kaushtubha jewel as embryo” \(*BP* 3.8.30\).1

As the sponsor \(*yajamana*\) of this building, Nandivarman no doubt believed he would reap its fruits as Krishna describes them in the *Bhagavata Purana:* “By establishing my icon \(*archa*\), one gains the whole earth; by establishing my dwelling, the three realms of rebirth; by such things as worship \(*puja*\), the world of Brahma; and by all three, equality with me \(*matsamyata*\)” \(*BP* 11.27.52\). All three acts, Krishna explains, are to be performed according to the disciplines of rites taught by Veda and Tantra \(*vaidikatantrikaih*\), a combination characteristic of the Pancharatra Agama \(*BP* 11.27.49\). Since Nandivarman had fulfilled all three by sponsoring the Emperor’s Vishnu-house and its liturgies he was presumably qualified for eventual “equality” with Krishna. By “equality” Krishna presumably means residence with him in his Highest Home \(*dhama parama*\), as he explains to Arjuna in the *Bhagavad*-*gita* \(*BG* 15.4–6\). Dwelling with God in his Highest Home is the mode of emancipation \(*mukti*\) known as salokya. Resemblance to Him suggests the further mode of emancipation known as sarupa, in which one’s shape is God’s shape. Tirumangai suggests in his poem about the temple that sarupa is Nandivarman’s destiny. In this final stanza, Tirumangai gives his name as Kalikanri, which means “one who put down with a strong hand the might of Kali,” perhaps an honorific title \(*PT* 2.9.10\):


The Pallavas’ Sovereign of ancient fame

Lives long in the land,

The Emperor who built the Vishnu-house

Well described by Kalikanri,

Ruler of Mangai’s people and her

vast fields of abundant paddy,

In this rich and beautiful garland

Of Tamil purity whose skillful singers

\(By the grace of our Great Goddess Shri\)

Shall rule with brilliance in that shining World

Of abundant water surrounded by the Ocean

Which thunders like the warring chariots

Of the kings who rule this world.


Nandivarman was a Bhagavata emperor, and his dharma was not to cultivate the purity of consciousness Kalikanri says will result from “skillful” singing of his poem. But his dharma did allow him to obtain the same fruits by building a residence for this Master and serving Him there, which he did.

In addition to this personal religious motivation, Nandivarman probably built the Emperor’s Vishnu-house as his response to Rajasimha’s great temple across the city, constructed some fifty years earlier. A Bhagavata emperor in Kanchipuram would not want a Maheshvara predecessor to excel him in devotion. And like that great monument, this Vishnu-house must have been splendid to behold and walk through, for many, if not all, of its sculptures were painted, probably in the same colors the *Bhagavata Purana* instructs devotees to perceive in their own visualizations \(*dhyana*\) \(Mahalingam 1969: 184–185\). It must have been a powerful visual and sensual experience for any serious devotee to enter the mandala through its western gate, walk around the enclosing prakara wall, walk into the vimana and around the bottom sanctum, climb the stairs to the sanctum above, walk around it, and then walk downstairs and circumambulate yet again. Walking through a colorful mandala in this manner is what adepts in yoga, dhyana, dharana, and samadhi can do through their disciplined imaginations without moving an inch. But they are a minority among the devout. It is far easier for everyone else to participate in God’s enormously complex body by walking, and this is what Nandivarman enabled them to do.

According to the evidence at hand, all other three-story Vishnu-houses built in southern India appeared after Nandivarman had built this one. By 806 one was built in Uttaramerur, south of Kanchipuram, and by 808 another was built in Kuram, north of Kanchipuram. In the Pandya realm, one was built in the capital of Madurai, and one in Tirukkottiyur east of Madurai, both probably in the ninth century \(Soundara Rajan 1975: 261–262\). Another was built in 866 in the Ay domain at Parthavasekharapuram near modern Trivandram at India’s southern tip.2 Significantly, the appearance of these Bhagavata tritala-vimanas coincides chronologically and geographically with the appearance of the four most prolific Alvar poets. Kalikanri or “Tirumangai” in the Pallava realm and Catakopan or “Nammalvar” in the Pandya realm are datable to the latter half of the eighth century. Vishnuchittan or “Periyalvar” and his daughter Kotai or “Antal” in the Pandya realm are datable to the first half of the ninth century, and perhaps later.

These unique temples and poems reveal a singular period of Bhagavata creativity in southern India, a fact recorded in the *Bhagavata Purana*, in a portion that may be dated to between the sixth and ninth centuries, but more likely the latter. This portion is divided between Books Five \(5.2–15\) and Eleven \(11.2–5\) and consists of three stories. One is the story of the avatara of Vasudeva named Rishabha, another is the story of his son Bharata, and the third is the story of Rishabha’s nine sons who are “ascetics clothed in the wind” \(*shramana vatarashana;* 11.2.20.\). The first two stories appear in a book that otherwise teaches cosmology, and the third appears in the Krishna story \(*Krishakatha*\) as it leads to the beginning of the Kali Yuga with the destruction of the descendents of King Yadu.

There are two reasons to date this set of three stories to these centuries. Padmanabha Jaini provides the first in his discussion of the Jina Rishabha’s transformation into an avatara of Vishnu \(Jaini 1977: 321–337\). Jaini observes that although the first tirthankara, Rishabha, has always held the prime place in Jaina devotion, biographical details of Rishabha and of his son Bharata appeared among Jainas only in the sixth century, and then only in “the commentaries beginning with the *Avshyaka*-*niruti* of Bhadrabahu II.” These, he says, are written in Prakrit and “used primarily by Jain monks in their daily ritual and hence not easily accessible to the public abroad” \(Jaini 1977: 331\). But the story of Rishabha became widely known when Jinasena told it in his *Adipurana* of the ninth century. Jinasena was a Digambara acharya, the guru of the Rashtrakuta king Amoghavarsha I \(ca. 814–880\). He established his court in Malkhed in northeastern Karnataka. Amoghavarsha was “an apostate from his traditional Vaishnava faith” according to Jaini, and he identifies him as “the king named Arhat of Konka, Venka, and Kutaka” described in *BP* 5.6.9–11 \(Jaini 1977: 329\). In Amoghavarsha’s court, he argues, Jinasena refashioned the tirthankara Rishabha into a godlike Jina that could compete in the minds of Jaina laity with the trimurti of Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva:

The waves of the *bhakti* movement that had swept over the whole range of Indian life finally over-took the atheist Jains and forced them to deify, as it were, their human *tirthankaras* or face the peril of extinction. Probably the move brought to the surface the emotional hunger of the Jain laity for an object of worship more gracious and glamorous than merely the austere figure of an exalted human teacher. Jinasena very skillfully provided the Jain laity with a new identity of a socially honoured caste of “neo-Brahmans,” a new book of codes in the guise of a Purana, and a new mage of the Jina endowed with a grandeur and majesty that could easily compete with the Hindu trinity. \(Jaini 1977: 335\)

Jaini says it is highly probable that Jinasena’s *Adipurana* is the reason for the account in the *Bhagavata Purana*, and he may be correct. But since details of the stories of the tirthankara Rishabha and his son Bharata had been developed among Jaina ascetics since the sixth century, it is not impossible that the Bhagavata interpretation of Rishabha as an avatara of Vasudeva has it origins during this period, as well. Moreover, the king of Dakshina Karnataka named Arhat \(Jina\) may be a collective representation of royal patrons of Jainas from this same period, and not a specific reference to the ninth-century king Amoghavarsha I, as Jaini argues.

Jaina literature flourished from patronage by Kadambas of the late fourth to early sixth centuries, by the Sendrakas subordinate to the early Chalukyas from the sixth century, by the Gangas from the seventh century, and by the Rashtrakutas from the eighth century \(*EITA* 1.2 Text: 6–7, 108\). Intimate knowledge of Jaina thought during this period was available to Bhagavata acharyas by means of marriages between the rulers in Kanchipuram and these patrons of Jainas, notably through the maternal line.3 In the sixth century, the wife of the Bhagavata ruler Simhavarman \(ca. 535–580\), and mother of the Bhagavata ruler Simhavishnuvarman \(ca. 560–580\), constructed an Arhat temple for the Yapaniya Sangha \(Yavanika Sangha\) of the Jainas in the realm of the Western Gangas. Her intent was to generate glory for her husband’s family and her own merit \(Mahalingam 1969: 54–55\). She may also have patronized the Jaina temple for Jina Vardhamana, which existed in Kanchipuram at the time \(*EITA* 1.1 Text: 23, 74\).

Nandivarman Pallavamalla began \(or perhaps continued\) generations of intermarriage with courts patronizing Jainas. Sometime after his unction ca. 731 he went into exile among the Rasthrakutas \(his career will be discused in greater detail in chapter 4\). He then married Reva, daughter of Dantidurga \(a.k.a. Sahastunga Dantidurga Khadgavaloka\). Dantidurga ruled from an uncertain place from 733 until he vanquished the Chalukyan Kirttivarman II. By 753 he had assumed sovereign titles. Around this time he assisted Nandivarman in regaining the throne in Kanchipuram, and surrounded the capital with his troops while Nandivarman received Bhagavata consecration \(Tirumangai records this in *Periya Tirumoli* 2.8\). Dantidurga converted a Buddhist cave at Ellora \(number fifteen\) into a Bhagavata cave-temple, where he left an inscription, and may have begun the celebrated Kailasanatha temple adjacent to it \(cave sixteen\).4 Dantidurga and his daughter Reva may have been Bhagavatas, but Digambara and Yapaniya Jainas found considerable patronage in their court. Sometime in the middle of the century, the Digambara acharya Akalankadeva \(ca. 720–780\), a noted author on Jaina epistemology and logic, challenged the Brahamavadins in a dialectical disputation at Dantidurga’s court. And this was only one example of Rashtrakuta patronage of Jaina acharyas and their scholarship before Amoghavarsha took Jinasena as his guru \(*EITA* 1.2 Text: 108\).

The son born to Nandivarman and Reva took Dantivarnam as his coronation name, honoring his maternal grandfather Dantidurga. He was a Bhagavata with connections to the Jainas of the Rashtrakuta court through his mother. Dantivarman married Aggalanimmati of the Kadambas of Vanavasi in Karnataka, who had long patronized several Jaina sects including the Svetambara, Digambara, and Yapaniya \(*EITA* 1.2 Text: 6\). Dantivarman began as the junior ruler \(*yuvaraja*\) at the end of his father’s reign and continued ruling until ca. 845. His son by Aggalanimmati reenforced the Pallava connection to his grandmother’s Rashtrakuta lineage—and to the Jainas patronized there—by taking as his wife a daughter of Amoghavarsha named Sankha. He took the coronation name of Nandivarman III in honor of his paternal grandfather. He ruled for about twenty-two years \(844–866\). During these years his father-in-law Amoghavarsha \(ca. 814–880\) ruled in Malkhed in northeastern Karnataka. His guru was the Digambara acharya Jinasena, the famous composer of the *Adipurana*, which his disciple Gunabhadra completed. And Gunabhadra was the guru of Amoghavarsha’s son Krishna I \(*EITA* 1.2 Text: 108\).

According to Jaini, this is when the Jina Rishabha entered the Bhagavata Purana as an avatara of Vishnu.

Nandivarman III eventually divided the Pallava realm between his two sons by his two wives. He gave its southern part to his son by Sankha named Nripatungavarman \(ca. 854–880\). He was an ally first of the Pandyan Shrimara and then of his son Varagunvarman II, both of whom appear to have been Bhagavatas. Nandivarman III gave the northern part of his realm to his son named Kampavarman by his wife Kandan Marampavaiyar of the Palluvettaraiyar. He ruled ca. 847–880. Kampavarman married into another royal family who patronized Jainas through Vijaya, daughter of Prithvipati I of the Gangas, based in Gangavadi in Karnataka and allied with the Rashtrakutas at Malkhed. They had a son named Aparajitavarman \(ca. 875–894\).

Rivalry between these half-brothers—Nripatunga in the south allied with Pandyas sympathetic to Bhagavata Dharma, and Kampavarman in the north allied with Gangas and Rashtrakutas sympathetic to Jaina Dharma—led Kampavarman to push Nripatunga into the Kaveri River valley. With the aid of his Ganga father-in-law Prithvipati I, Kampavarman’s son Aparajitavarman finally defeated his paternal uncle in 878 or 881. Aparajitavarman—connected through his mother with Jaina patrons—was then sole ruler of the Pallava realm for about fifteen years until Aditya Chola slew him in ca. 894 and brought the Pallava Dynasty to its end.

As the above account documents, generations of family connections between royal patrons of Bhagavata Dharma and of Jaina Dharma would have provided contexts for the story of the Jina Rishabha as an avatara of Vishnu to develop long before Jinasena’s *Adipurana* in the middle of the ninth century. The Buddha as the ninth avatara appears in the first inscription listing the ten avataras, which is in the Adivaraha Cave-temple in Mamallapuram and is dated to the middle of the seventh century \(Srinivasan 1964:173\). It is unlikely that a story of Rishabha as an avatara would not have appeared by this time as well. But this would not be the developed literary version now contained in the *Bhagavata Purana*, and Jaini may be correct that it was composed in response to Jinasena’s *Adipurana* composed in the court of Dantivarman III’s father-in-law Amoghavarsha.

The second reason to think this literary telling of the story of Rishabha and Bharata entered the *Bhagavata Purana* between the sixth and ninth centuries—and most likely in the ninth—is found in an “old legend” \(*itihasa puratana*; *BP* 11.2.14\). This legend is about a discussion between Rishabha’s nine shramana sons and a king of Mithila in Videha named Nimi. When the shramana named Karabhajana teaches king Nimi he describes the greatness of the Kali Yuga \(*BP* 11.5.29–34\). In the Dvapara Yuga, he says, the Bhagavan is worshiped with the rites of Veda and Tantra, which refer to the Pancharatra Agama. But in the Kali Yuga he is worshiped with various Tantra rites in a form possessing a black complexion brilliant as sapphire, with all his arms, decorations, weapons, and attendants. Worshipers extol his glories and names through sankirtana, and they pray a mantra that ends with a description of Rama leaving Adyodhya and chasing a wild animal made of maya desired by Sita.

The Kali Yuga is the greatest of the four ages, Karabhajana explains, because people attain their goal merely through sankirtana; no better method exists. “People for whom Narayana is the last resort \(*narayanaparayanah*\),” Karabhajana observes, “appear more often in the Kali Yuga than in other times, and especially in the Dravida region” \(*BP* 11.5.39–40\). He then describes the Dravida region by its river systems. First there are the Tamraparni River and the Kritamala or Vaigai River, which sustain the Pandya realm. Second is the Payasvini or Palar River, which sustains the Pallava realm. Third is the Kaveri River “of great purity,” which sustains the Chola and Muttaraiyar realms. Fourth is “the great river flowing westward,” which sustains the Chera realm. This last in Tamil is the Great River \(*periya-aru*\) known today as the Periyar. It flows from the Western Ghats into the Arabian Sea in what is now Kerala.

According to R. Nagaswamy, however, recent excavations and discoveries of coins reveal that the capital of the Chera realm, which is known both as Karur and Vanji, was located not in Kerala but on the Anporunai or Amaravati River in Tamilnadu. This river originates in the western hills of Varahagiri. It flows eastward to join the Kaveri River near Karur, where the Chera capital existed probably from the time of Ashoka Maurya in the third century BCE. It flourished during the Sangam period from the first century CE. The Pallavas of Kanchipuram dominated the Kaveri region, including Karur, from the sixth century. But in the eighth century it was still considered the Chera capital, because when Nandivarman conquered Karur he took the Chera title of Villavan. Tirumangai reports this in the first stanza of his poem about this Vishnu-house \(*PT* 2.9.1\). This conquest early in the second half of the eighth century is probably the occasion for the Chera to shift their capital of Karur or Vanji to “the great river flowing westward” in Kerala. From the twelfth century on, these names in Tamil literature refer to the Chera’s western capital on the Periyar, not to its original location on the Anporunai or Amaratavti River \(Nagaswamy 1995: 107–108\).

Since Karabhajana refers to “the great river flowing westward” as the system sustaining the Chera realm, therefore, this “ancient legend” must not be earlier than the end of the eighth century. But its description of Bhagavata devotion in Dravida points later into the ninth century, for as we have noted, the most prolific Tamil poets of Bhagavata devotion lived in the Pallava, Chola, and Pandya realms the legend describes by means of their rivers: Kalikanri or “Tirumangai”; Chatakopan or “Nammalvar”; Vishnuchittan or “Periyalvar”; and Kotai or “Antal.” Dating to the second half of the eighth century and to the ninth, they proclaim in their Tamil poems the doctrine that Karabhajana says is popular in Dravida. It teaches complete submission to the Giver of Emancipation \(*mukunda*\), with no debts or obligations to any other being, and with love \(*priya*\) focused completely on Him \(*BP* 11.5.41–42\). This is the Bhagavata doctrine of taking refuge in God \(*prapatti*\) and living thereafter as a refugee \(*prapanna*\) in complete dependence. In Bhagavata Dharma this doctrine of dependence exists alongside the doctrine of ritual activity, which by the eighth century we may call Bhagavata Tantra. Krishna teaches Arjuna both doctrines \(*BG* 12.6–11\). But in the end he urges him to live dependently as a prapanna refugee \(*BG* 18.65–66\). Kotai’s *Tiruppavai* records the prapanna doctrine as found in Villi’s New Town \(*Villipputtur*\) south of Madurai. It is devotion expressed openly to others. But in her *Nacchiyar Tirumoli* she records her own practice of Tantra. It is devotion expressed secretly \(Hudson 1980 and 2000b\).

Nandivarman Pallavamalla’s newly built Vishnu-house presumably played a role in the generation of this enormously creative period of Bhagavata Dharma in Dravida. It is possible, for example, that Kotai’s father Vishnuchittan had Nandivarman in mind when he composed his New Year poem for Krishna called *Tiruppallantu* or “Many Years.”5 Its first stanza ends with Krishna subduing the wrestler Chanura in the Mathura wrestling ring before he kills Kamsa:


Many years, many years,

Many thousands of years,

Many millions of hundreds of thousands

May there be auspicious protection

For the beauty of your red feet,

O Krishna the color of black gem

With arms so powerful

They subdued the wrestler.


A depiction of Krishna wrestling Chanura appears on the middle-floor sanctum of the Emperor’s Vishnu-house as the conclusion of a sculpted sequence that implicitly records Krishna’s subjugation of Nandivarman through the consecration \(*diksha*\) that made him his beloved slave. Vishnuchittan may have had this depiction in mind; he may have used Chanura to represent the “Pallava Wrestler” in Kanchipuram, to honor him during the rule of Pandyan Bhagavatas who replaced Maravarman Rajasimha \(730–765\), the Shaiva Pandya who supported the opponents of Nandivarman’s rule.

Maravaraman Rajasimha’s immediate successor was Varagunavarman I \(765–815\), followed by Shrimara Shrivallabha \(815–862\) and then by Varagunavarman II.6 We have already met the last as a close ally of the Pallava king Nripatungavarman, whose vassel he may have become \(*EITA* 1.1 Text: 111\). Varagunavarman I is identified as a paramavaishnava in the Shrivaramangala copper plates of ca. 770, and he had a minister who was known as Maran Kari and as Madhura Kavi. This minister may be the same Madhurakavi who wrote a single poem of eleven stanzas \(*kannin chirutampu*\) to honor the Alvar he calls “The Venerable One of Southern Kurukur” \(*tenkurukur nampi*\). His name is Maran Chatakopan and he lives at Kurukurnakar on the Porunal or Tamparaparni River \(*TVM* 4.5.11\). He holds the office of the “Nakaran of bounteous Kurukur,” which suggests that he is a village or temple master \(*TVM* 4.10.11\).7 But he is also “Chatakopan, the Pandya Lord of the Tamparaparni River” \(*TVM* 9.2.11\), “Chatakopan, the chief of Kurukai and the Pandya lord of fertile groves” \(*TVM* 3.6.11\), and “the Pandya district lord of prosperous groves” \(*TVM* 8.9.11\). He holds this last position for a long time \(*TVM* 5.6.11\). If Madhurakavi in the copperplate dated ca. 770 is the same as the poet Madhurakavi, this means that he and Chatakopan, a Pandyan official in Kurukur on the Tampraparni River, were contemporaries of Nandivarman Pallavamalla, and of Tirumangai in the latter half of the eighth century.

Vishnuchittan and his daughter Kotai in Villi’s New Town south of Madurai appear to have lived later. In the penultimate stanza of *Tiruppallantu*, Vishnuchittan says, “Like Chelvan Apimanatunkan, king of those joined in the faultless assembly, I, too, am an old slave of Yours, Tirumal.” *Chelvan apimanatunkan* means “the prosperous man who is dear” and is equivalent in Sanskrit to *Shri vallabhah*, which is the title of the Pandyan Shrimaran Shrivallabhan. Since Shrivallabhan ruled 815–862, and since Vishnuchittan says that both of them are old, we may date Vishnuchittan and his daughter Kotai to the first half of the ninth century. The term translated as “those… in the … assembly,” which is *kottiyar*, may refer to the Pandya ghatika, a learned assembly \(*goshthi*\) of Brahmins connected to kingship. Or it may refer to the inhabitants of the town east of Madurai known as Tirukottiyur \(Shri Goshtipuram in Sanskrit\). This town will reappear below.

Further evidence of the far-reaching creative influence of Nandivarman’s newly built Vishnu-house during these years of these “waves of the bhakti movement” appears in two poems composed by Chatakopan and translated by A. K. Ramanujan. They are organized according to the same sequence of iconic postures found in the Emperor’s Vishnu-house. But Chatakopan begins at the top with Krishna standing on earth, moves to him reclining as Brahma’s origin in the middle, and ends with him sitting in his Highest Home on the bottom. The first poem is *Tiruvaymoli* 7.6.5, to I have appended clarifying which notes:


My cowherd

\[*standing*\]

my rough dark diamond



how will this self of mine



ever-trammeled in the three

\[*reclining*\]

worlds unfolding



in your navel’s lotus



how will it come through



and reach you there

\[*sitting*\]

in your overwhelming world of light?8




Tirumangai shares this interpretation of these three iconic postures, as we shall later see. The top sanctum is God’s grossly material body \(*sthulasharira*\) where He stands as Krishna in the world we inhabit. The middle sanctum is God’s subtle material body \(*sukshmasharira*\), where He reclines as the source of our world. This is where Brahma repeatedly goes to sleep and awakens for a lifetime we experience as the repeated dissolution and emanation of our seemingly endless world of death and birth, the realm of samsara so difficult to cross. The bottom sanctum is God’s body of pure material being \(*shuddhasattva*\), which Krishna calls his Highest Home. It is the ultimate goal for anyone seeking emancipation from samsara. Chatakopan’s problem translates into the terms of the three-story vimana this way: How can we move from the top-floor sanctum to the bottom-floor sanctum without getting trapped in the middle-floor sanctum?

He offers a solution to this problem in the second poem, which is *Tiruvaymoli* 8.7.9. It is the consecrated life of disciplined devotion according to Bhagavata Tantra—and it appears that the sadhana he followed produced astonishing results for him:


My dark one

\[*standing*\]

stands there as if nothing’s changed



after taking entire



into his maw



all three worlds

\[*reclining*\]

the gods



and the good kings



who hold their lands



as a mother would



a child in her womb—



and I



by his leave

\[*sitting*\]

have taken him entire



and I have him in my belly

\[*Chatakopan’s body*\]

for keeps.9




If we were to unpack this poem we would have a concise summary of Bhagavata Dharma in ninth-century south India. Chatakopan’s statement, “I by his leave have taken him entire” combines the devout dependence of the refugee prapanna on God’s grace with the ceremonial activities of a Tantrika liturgical discipline. Chatakopan’s skill in that discipline may explain the experience he recorded in another poem, an experience that may be like that of a chamiyati through whom a being speaks to others, but probably more like that of a yogin wordless in enstatic consciousness. As Ramanujan translated *Tiruvaymoli* 10.7.1, “Poets, beware, your life is in danger: the lord of gardens is a thief,… he … sneaked into my body,… he consumed me life and limb, and filled me, made me over into himself.”10

In both these poems Chatakopan reports his perception of a profound mystery: He holds God in his self, and God holds him in His self, and yet God remains in the sanctum as icon. Krishna’s Highest Home of overwhelming light and Chatakopan’s gross body of overwhelming darkness become neither two nor one, but something in between. This “in-between-ness” is the subject of the first poem in his *Tiruvaymoli* collection \(1.1.4\), also translated by Ramanujan:


We here and that man, this man,

and that other in-between,

and that woman, this woman,

and that other, whoever,

those people, and these,

and these others in-between,

this thing, that thing,

and this other in-between, whichever,

all things dying, these things,

those things, those others in-between,

good things, bad things,

things that were, that will be,

being all of them,

he stands there.11


In still another poem Chatakopan confesses the impossibility of talking about such a mystery \(in my translation of *Tiruvaymoli* 2.5.10\):


Not a man, not a woman,

and not a man-woman

different from these;

Not seen, not existing,

but not *not* existing too;

Appearing as the shape desired

when the time for worship comes,

yet not that either—

Talk of our Bhagavan

Is so oblique

It falls apart completely.


How should we understand these amazing correlations between Nandivarman’s Vishnu-house of three sanctums in Kanchipuram and poems composed by Chatakopan living in the Pandya realm hundreds of miles to the south? I think it unlikely that Nandivarman or his acharya expressed a new Bhagavata doctrine through their unique tritala-vimana; instead they brought into view the doctrine of three dimensions in God’s body that is found in the *Bhagavad-gita* and other portions of the *Mahabharata*, and that is implied by the vyuha theology of the Pancharatra Agama, evidence of which appears in the latter half of the first millennium BCE. Acharyas in royal courts apparently taught this doctrine to their disciples by means of a mandala. For lack of a specific name we may call it “Krishna’s Mandala.”12

This mandala must have been present wherever there were consecrated Bhagavatas as adept as Chatakopan, and it accounts for the correlations between *Tiruvaymoli* 7.6.5. and 8.7.9 and the Paramecchuravinnagaram. The fact that Nandivarman used his three-dimensional built form of Krishna’s Mandala as a summa of Bhagavata Dharma further suggests that it was the paradigm for the entire religious system. We shall discuss it in detail when we turn to the Emperor’s Vishnu-house in parts II and III.



## **The Name of the Vishnu-house: Paramecchura as God, Emperor, and Architect**

The official name of the Vaikuntha Perumal Temple when it was built encodes important information. Tirumangai uses it in its Tamil form, *Paramecchuravinnagaram*. Its Sanskrit form, *parameshvara-vishnugriha*, was used in an inscription carved on the vimana about 813 to record the gift of a gold vessel by Nandivarman’s son and successor, Dantivarman \(Minakshi 1941: 1\). Paramecchura and Parameshvara literally mean “supreme ruler.” As used in the poem, *Paramecchuravinnagaram* may be interpreted in three ways: as the “Supreme Ruler’s Vishnu-house”; as the “Emperor’s Vishnu-house”; and as the “Vishnu-house of the Emperor’s Architect.”

In the first interpretation, as a title for the Bhagavan, Supreme Ruler refers to the sitting icon on the bottom floor. As we shall see, this icon embodies God’s formation \(*vyuha*\) called Vasudeva, the Supreme Ruler of the brahmanda, or what we may call “spacetime.”13

In the second interpretation, as a title for the Pallava ruler, Supreme Ruler means emperor, and the inscriber of a grant Nandivarman made ca. 753–754 describes himself as “The Majestic Emperor’s Master Woodworker.”14 This use also appears in the inscription on the south prakara walkway, which we shall examine in detail in chapter 4. The inscription’s first label refers to the Parameshvara who died before Pallavamalla ascended the throne. The third label refers to Pallavamalla as the boy who would become the Parameshvara. The tenth label describes the status of Parameshvara he received after the unction that made him an Indra of Men \(*narendra*\) with the name Nandivarman.

The eleventh label adds, however, the Tamil title Perumanatikal. Literally, this means “the feet \(*atikal*\) of the Bhagavan \(*peruman*\).” In the context of a Vishnu-house it denotes the feet of the icon where offerings are placed.15 When applied to a person, *perumanatikal* means that he has offered his self to the Bhagavan’s feet to be his slave. The paradigm for this is the asura king Bali, who offers himself at the feet of Dwarf after he takes his three strides \(*BP* 8.2–11\). Since the plural “feet” \(*atikal*\) may also denote respect, I understand the title in Nandivarman’s case to mean the Bhagavan’s Venerable Slave. It is the Tamil equivalent of the Sanskrit title *paramabhagavata*, which means the Bhagavan’s Supreme Slave. Both terms likewise refer to the King of Kings and Supreme Ruler \(*rajadhirajaparameshvara*\), a title for Nandivarman that appears in a grant dated ca. 753–754 \(*SII* 2. 342–361, stanza 71\). The word “emperor” as used here captures all these meanings.

The third interpretation of *paramecchura* and *parameshvara* refers to the imperial architect who designed the Emperor’s Vishnu-house. We know from an inscription in the first three-story vimana built after this one, which was about 806 in Uttaramerur, that its architect was called *parameshvara-peruntacchan*.16 This may mean that the master architect’s name was Parameshvara, but more likely it means that he was the master architect serving the emperor, in other words the Imperial Architect. According to the inscription, he belonged to the area of Kanchipuram called simply Patakam, which means “the section” \(*patakam*\) and is the short form of Pumpatakam, which means “the prosperous \(*pum*\) section.” It was west of the elevated portion of the city’s ancient center.

This Imperial Architect may have been the same master architect who appears in the grant Nandivarman issued near the very end of his reign in response to Tirumangai’s request. It mentions the Master Architect \(*per**untacchan*\) of Vitelvituku Pallava. The word *vitelvituku* names the oath Nandivarman took during his unction at the beginning of his career.17 This master architect is said to live in the Aimpanaiccheri section of Kanchipuram, and his son, Shri Dandi, carved the letters of the grant on the copper plates.18 Perhaps Aimpanaiccheri was the official name for the prosperous section of the city known as Patakam.19

An inscription on the foundation of the Uttaramerur temple notes that “scholars of Agama” \(*agamika*\) guided its architect. Given the Pancharatra basis of Nandivarman’s earlier vimana in Kanchipuram, it may be that these agamikas also followed the Pancharatra Agama. Gros and Nagaswamy argue, however, that the Shriveli vimana in Uttaramerur was designed according to the Vaikhanasa Agama, specifically according to the *Marichi-samhita*.20 This issue cannot be settled here. But I suggest that the direction in which a vimana faces indicates its purpose, and that a vimana’s purpose accounts for its design, which means differently arranged and oriented tritala-vimanas may derive from the same liturgical tradition, in this case the Pancharatra.21

The Agama scholar who guided the Imperial Architect in designing the Emperor’s Vishnu-house obviously possessed a very complex vision of God’s body transmitted by Bhagavata Dharma through text, liturgy, iconography, and architecture. He was no doubt an acharya, a scholar priest who consecrated devotees and taught his disciples the meanings of the mantras they received. By the mid-eighth century, lineages of such Bhagavata acharyas supported by their disciples in royal courts and private households had existed in India for at least a millennium. Nandivarman’s acharya guided the Imperial Architect in designing his three-dimensional mandala properly, a fact recorded on the prakara walkway, as illustrated by the composite photograph in Figure 1.1.

These sculptures appear in an enthronement scene we shall discuss in chapter 4, which moves from north to south \(the viewer’s right to left\). The enthroned acharya appears after a display of the ritual implements by means of which Pallavamalla’s general, Udayachandra, slew his rival Chitramaya Pallavaraja and then won seven battles “and more” to give his emperor “the whole realm.” The acharya’s place in this sequence suggests that he supervised the rites of the conch, drum, and khatvanga whose tejas brought all this about, and then designed the tritala-vimana to house the emperor’s Master.

Before we turn to the poem Tirumangai composed about this vimana and to the Vishnu-house itself, let us consider six concepts important to the discussion that follows.
