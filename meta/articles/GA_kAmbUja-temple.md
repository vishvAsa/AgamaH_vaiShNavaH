Apart from the exalted siddhAnta shaivam, the venerable pA~ncarAtra of vaiSNava-s also received patronage in kambUjadesha. Here is another text from an inscription during the reign of jayavarman I, from a stele found in the Wat Po Wal of Battambang: (Unfortunately, incomplete)

The viSNu of the temple is beautifully named trailokyasAra (Essence of the three worlds). The unnamed worshiper/sacrificer (yajvan) performs the five sacrifices (pa~ncayaj~na), is one who approaches (abhigAmin) the deity for pa~ncakAla pUjA.

By calling the priest abhigAmin (he who approaches, he who does abhigamana), this inscription is referring to the technical term used in pA~ncarAtra texts for offering worship to a deity in a temple, that is, abhigamana.
