The Vedas represent the earliest extant literature in the world They are four, under the names of Rgveda, Yajurveda, Samaveda and Atharvaveda They record many aspects of the life of the people of ancient India whose religious beliefs and aspirations left an indelible mark on their social life. 

Indeed, the religions and social aspects became inextricably mixed up with each other But it must not be forgotten that the Vedas deal primarily with the religious beliefs and practices of ancient India 

Whether the Vedas are regarded as eternal as Hindu tradition believes, or as composed by a number of authors at different periods and then codified, it must be admitted that the concept of the Deity must have been an article of faith long before the ancient Indians felt any urge to offer worship There was also the realization that man has to depend on the Deity for protection from danger and distress and for a secure and happy life. To evoke response from a deity when a person offered his prayer to gain any particular objective, or to offer thanksgiving for the fulfilment of the prayer, an offering of what that person had with him was made Usually, the offering was made in the sacred fire which was believed to convey it to the deity concerned The prayers are recorded in the Rgueda and the ways and means of the offerings to be made are treated in the Yajurveda. The Samaveda helped in chanting those prayers so as to attract the Deity As for the Atharvaveda, it provided the people with the means to protect themselves against enemies and evil forces.

others God then became identical with the mantra, Many deities appeared thus to the same or various meditators and thus many mantras came into existence. Those mantras which were of the nature of praise were also called rks 15 Some of these mantras were used with or without change when set to music and sung and when making offerings to the deities concerned. The meditator is thus a seer of the mantra (mantradrastr) and not its author Those who have realized this are known as the rstr 

for the particular mantras the rsis for some rks 

The word 'mantra 

Hence some sages are considered as 

is considered to have been connected with the faculty of thinking which is the sense of the root 'man' or 'matrı' 16 When the rls occur In the Vedic texts for employment in sacred rites, they no longer have the denotation of the faculty of thinking. Besides, certain passages which convey senses other than thinking, are also called mantras So, It is held that whichever passage is specifically mentioned in the Ved c texts as mantra must be named as such 17 

Regarding the concept of God and the characteristic features of deities in the Rgueda, the scholars of the West contend that the religion of the Rgueda represents that of a primitive society marked by the "spontaneous emotional reactions of wonder, awe and fear evoked in man by natural phenomena such as the wind, the sun and the moon. Impressed by these powerful and inexplicable forces of Nature, primitive man reacted with emotional attitudes and behaviour to which'

"religion" is given 18 Prsonification of 

of the supernatural and the anthropomorphic concepts of Nature are also held to have given rise to the idea of Gud in primi ive society 19 Some scholars are of opinion that the Vedic culture was influenced by magic acts, fertility rites and other prim t ve manifestations of religion The p.rformance of these Was intended to stimulate or propitiate the powers of Nature and so was consider.d as an obligatory duty. A study of pumive culture is thus quite essential for understanding Vedic culture 20 

These findings of the Western scholars could be accepted, if the Rgveda conta ns any evidence to support them A society which is called primitive is distinguish.d from a civilized one and, on this ground, is held to be inferior to the latter order to avoid this kind of attitude towards that society, the word 'preliterate is often used by modern writers. 

TH 

Certainly the society and culture as depicted in the Rgveda are no pri muve There are certain featur s which b-long on'y to primitive < ciety and none of then are traceable in the Reveda There is nothing like the mana' of the Polynesians, the 'maniton' of the North Am ricans, tyrannical practices characterized by cruelty and rough behavt ur, head-hunting for achieving a greater starus, tattoo, taboos and tot mism 

These are negative pces of evidence to prove that the religion of the Vedas is not primitive 

On the other hand, there are substantial pice s of evidence to show that society in the Vedic period wa, cvilizad Family life is well d.picted with people striving for and living a happy

and prosperous life 21 The ideal of a rastra was quite familiar to the people of that period 22 Homes, gatherings. garments and the use of horses and chariots are frequently referred 10, suggesting an advanced and developed society on the material plan. 23 

Words 24 like cäru, sumangaliḥ, saubhagalva and others bring out the aesthetic sense of that society Fine poetry,25 with attractive similes, points to the literary excellence of the Rgveda 

Culturally, the standard of the Rgueda marks a well advanced stage of society Acts of worship and prayer, accompanied by offerings, convey the friendly attitude of the people towards the dens The relation between a devotee and his god as described reveals reciprocal aff ction and familiarity between them 26 This can be compared only to the relation which is noticed in the cult of bhakts of later days Lastly, lofty ideals of culture are suggested in the prayers offered by the peopl. 27 All these show that the culture and religion of the Vedas were well advanced and so could not have belonged to a primitive society. 

Sup'rnaturalism is an important element of religion, It is a belief that there is a reality over and above the forces of Nature This reality is acknowledged by both preliterate and civilized societies. So the worship of this reality as manifested in Nature cannot be treated as worship of Nature or anthro- pomorphism or personification of natural phenomena. Neither the cosmic experience nor the awe and fear evoked in man by natural phenomena could be taken as having given rise to the

origin of religion. Faith in the deity as governing the moral order must be taken as accounting for its rise. 

Even if we concede that magic arts could have been responsible for the rise of culture and religion in a primitive society, it has no relevance for Vedic culture. The Rgveda does not have any direct reference to such acts Whatever references are there, suggestive of such practices in the Rgueda, and, more so, in the Tajurveda, may be deemed as survivals from a hoary past. The Atharvaveda does contain many references to them, It would be reasonable to take the major portion of the Atharva- veda as compiled long before the Rgueda, but on this account it would not be proper to trace the origin of religion to magic 

Not only were the ancient people aware of the concept of the deity, but they had also knowledge of the distinct traits of several gods Indra is depicted as a warrior, Agni and Brhaspati as priests and Rudra and Asvins as physicians. Some deities are depicted as passing through the air in their chariots drawn by steed. 28 Their limbs and ornaments are frequently referred to as dazzling.29 They are offered seats made of sacred grass,30 and served with milk, butter, grain and flesh of sheep and other animals 31 The soma juice is frequently stated to be an offering to deities 32 

Such descriptions show that a particular god was conceived in the manner in which he presented himself to the seers and that each deity had some definite features with which he was identified. Sometimes, while a particular deity is glorifed, another deity is also brought in and extolled together with the

It is not therefore proper to hold that the deities of the Vedas did not have definite forms at all and much more Inaccurate is it to treat the Vedic deities as lacking in individuality The deities must have appeared before the seers with their distinct features which were identifiable to them and which were described by them in expressions with which they were quite familiar. 

Though the gods appeared before sages through mantras and were depicted by them, they went out of sight afterwards.

Vedic seers were aware of the possession of physical forms by the gods. Yet the Vedas do not contain a specific description of the person of the deity. This is clear from the role that Agni played in sacrifices. Agni is considered as the bearer of oblations to the gods, which means that the gods did not appear in person to receive the offerings. This made the Mimämsä schools of thought argue that a god is only mantra and there is no god apart from 11,40 Supreme significance came to be attached to the scrupulous attention to be paid to the uttering of mantras without the least inaccuracy.41 

While the concept of divinity was developing on these lines, there must have been growing another tendency to evolve a different concept of the deity, of course basing it on the teachings of the Vedas.42 The hotr, adhvaryu, udgätṛ and brahman, who were all connected with the performance of a Vedic ritual, wer. perhaps the only persons who were content with the identification of mantras with the gods Perhaps, those who assisted them also held the same view. Others who were Brahmins. Ksatriyas and Vaisyas, and did not have actual participation in such performances, might have remained content with this concept of God. The Vedantins, however, refuted it, admitting physical forms for the deities 43 

Long before the development of the Ithasas and Purānae there must have been an intense yearning on the part of the people to visu se the one supreme God in person. God however would not present Himself to one and all for the mule

Again, though gods and men appear to be friendly accord ng to the Vedic tenets, there is no direct evidence in them to prove that man had an intense longing to visual ze the one Sipreme God That is, the doctrine of bhakti does not appear have developed then. Those who performed the acrifices had only the awareness of their dependence on the gds for protection and secu ity They and those also who did not actually participate in the ritualistic performances, should hav had the concept of a Supreme God and even might have dev. ped a strong desire to see Him in person It is this intense liking that ripened later into bhaktı. 

B sides, there were Südras who formed the majority of the population There were also women who represented nearly half the people. Both these were not qualified for the s udy of the Vedas and for that reason had no competence to have the fitness to p rform the rituals They were not however, living in the dark. In a way, they should have known what God is B longing to the same community, they must have had abiding faith in what the sacrifiers belived. It must be no surprise if they, too, along with the men of the twice-burn castes, ch.rished a deep longing to visualiz: God. 

It is to satisfy the year ungs of these that the Agamas were brought into b ing. The word 'ägama' suggests that they came later than the Vedas 44 They are held to be intrins cally valid for the following reasons First, they are based on what the Vedas

Agamas are either the gods themselves or sages of great credibility who were steeped in the Vedic tradition. Further, the Agamas contain references to the Vedas and enjoin the adoption of Vedic mantras

The word agama' is derived from the root, gam", with the preposition 'a'. The sense of this root, which means 'to go", may also be moving (mentally) towards an object which is to be gained'. In this sense, the word conveys the same meaning as the word 'veda'. Besides, as the preposition 'a gives this root the sense of motion in the reverse direction, the word 'agama' can be taken to imply the handing down of knowledge from teacher to pupil, and thus to denote traditional (sampradaya) knowledge. Then the word 'agama' can be taken to mean what the Agamar stand for.

The Agamas are also known as Tantras. The word tantra is derived in two ways. According to one view it is from the root, 'tan", to spread, with the unadi suffix, stran.45 Hence some scholars 48 suggest that tantra' means the spreading out of the cosmic energy in the person who practises It. Others 47 take it in the sense of a system which elaborates the knowledge evidently acquired from the Vedas. To vindicate the validity of their system, the writers on Tantra seek to split the word as *tan' and 'tra (spreading and saving), so as to mean that Tantra gives an exposition of the matters taken up in the system and also saves the aspirants who follow it from bondage.48 The

word is also traced to the root tatri' which means sustaining or lending support, and hence can be taken in the sense of offering an exposition 49 Yet others take it to mean understanding,50 

The word, tantra, occurs in the sense of a sastra,51 as evidenced by the titles of works like Şaştıtantra Tantraväittika and others. It has acquired a specific sense in this lit.rature, It does not mean any sastra, but only the Tantrika system. 

An attempt is also sought to be made to specify the purposes served by the Agama and Tantra The Agama provides the aspirant with knowledge and Tantra saves him from bondage,52

However, the two names have come to signify the same system whose validity is held to be on a par with the Vedas, Snṛts and Purānas It is held that the Agamas bave special importance and validity in the Kaliyuga,

AGAMAS AND SOUTH INDIAN VAISNAVISM 

The Agamas have an independent development of theory and practice and should be taken as a system of philosophy and religion based on the Vedas. The theoretical side represents a continuation of the results of philosophical enquiries which the Vedas deal with. The controversies and discussions which mark these enquiries are left out in the Agamas. Greater attention is paid here to the cultural discipline which is sought to be inculcated through practical religion. 

The matters which the Agamas treat of could be brought under four heads, namely, jñāna, ***a, kriyā and caryā, which stand respectively for the knowlec reality, yogic practices for the realisation of the Ultimate Reality, preparation of materials and their collection for the worship of the · 

the religious practices. 

The Sashhita and Brahmana portions of the Vedas could be taken to form a unit containing a rich development of the concept of God who is to be worshipped through the performance of sacrifices. The various hymns of the Ṛgoeda were evolved at different periods in praise of the deities and found ritualistice use in portions of the Yajurveda and Sämaveda which had relevance to the propitiation of particular deities through sacrifices in which particular hymns were to be recited. The explanatory portions of the particular rituals, which had relevance, are found in the Brahmanas forming an integral part of those Rgvedic hymns that were employed for the purpose 

It is only later that Vyasa edited the mass of Vedic literature into the four Vedas, and the corresponding Samhita, Brahmaṇa, Aranyaka and Upanisad portions. 

The hymns of the Rgueda were classified by Vyasa in a particular order, taking into account the importance of the roles of the deities in the hymns. The first hymn which is in praise of Agni, was not composed at first and so was not the earliest. Any offering which is made to any god is to be made only in the sacred fire, and so Agni is extolled in this hymn 

INTRODUCTORY 

13 

which Vyasa placed at the beginning for that purpose. The concept of any deity cannot therefore be taken to represent an earlier or later stage simply on the ground whether or not he is extolled in the so called nuclear portion of the Rgveda In fact, which the nuclear portion is and which it is not, cannot be now discussed and decided, for the present classification was made by Vyasa long after the Vedas were compiled. 

Two major aspects of the concept of the deity emerge when the hymns of the Rgueda and others are given a thorough study. One is that all deities are not different and distinct from one another, but represe y several forms of a single Divine Aing 53 It is because of this aspect that the features revealed depiction of some deities overlap All the deities are real. Th the monotheistic tendency prevailed in the Vedic literature as such. To represent the Vedic religion as polytheism or henotheism is only to ignore this main aspect of the concept of the Deity The Aranyakas and Upanisads contain speculations and discussions on this concept. The second aspect is that God is the soul of the mobile and immobile worlds, representing the embodied living beings and inert matter respectively 64 These two aspects became the foundations of theism as developed in the different schools of Hindu religion 

There grew up a literature, during the period of the development of sacred literature represented in the Brāhmaṇas which took the shape of narratives, anecdotes and epics. This was concerned with a critical enquiry into the nature, activities and relative positions of the various gods The concept of a single divine Being was subjected to serious elucidation,

resulting in the identification of this B.ing. Agni and Indra were, of course, the chief deities in the Rived c hymns. Yet, V anu and Rudra did not have insignificant positions, as imagined by foreign scholars. It may be admitted that they were not favoured as against Agni, Indra and Virup. The bymns a idressed to these two contain what could be taken to be suggestive of the in'i mate relationship of the pople with them. The narratives and episodes did not und rmine the prominence of Agni and Varugar Indra, but were in favour of the exclusive worship of Vişņu or Rudra, 

The Agamas presuppose this aspect of the d.velopment of the concept of God Ohr deities are not treated as unreal. 

In fact, 

They are not, however, as eminent as V şi or Rudra they are of secondary significance, and are generally treated as forming parts of the retinue of Visa or Rudra. The Agamas arose in this way and their emphasis on the personal nature of Gid marked them out. They b came class fi:d, according to the deity exclusively glorified in each. 

A god treated as supreme cannot be conceived of as a mere Absolure, nor as one who is to be propitiated for a defirite purpose like obtaining rains, security from enemies or the elements of Nature, or prosperity of a particular kind F.r these purpos:s, the worship of particular deitus is commended, but this does not by any means lend support to any pre-eminent position for these deities. As a result of the development of the worship of the principal deities as recorded in the epics, Parāņas and other ancient literature, the Agamas evilved the cult of a single deity to the exclusion of all o hers 

He came 

to be looked upon as pre-eminent in the sense that he not only overshadowed the greatness and might of other gods, bu also had enough power to fu fil the aspirations of his worshippers. This trend is already noticed in some of the Purapas, like the Vişnu, Bhagavata, Skanda and others, 

Whether Vign or Rudra is admitted to be the pre-eminent God, it is necessary to recognize Him as endowed with

enormous potentialities and capacities to keep every thing under His control, to create the world and maintain it, affording protection and security to created beings. The Agamas therefore conceive of God as powerful (fakta) The power (sakti) which God possesses is not external to Him, for in that case His relationship to and control over it will have to be explained, which may lead to the undesirable admission of power (sakti) being independent of God For this reason, the Agamas recognize God as never dissociated from power This power is not inert like primordial matter (prakṛt); in which case, it should occupy a very subordinate position in relation to God. Hence the Agamas describe this power (sakti) as animate. The feminine gender of the word, sakts', suggests that this should be a goddess ever associated with God as His consort. As such, this goddess is named differently as Laksmi, Durgā, Māyā and others. The Godhead therefore 18 a two-in-one reality. Except for the Śrīsūkta 55 and later portions of the Mahānārayaniya Upanisad,58 the Vedic literature does not conceive of the co-presence of a female principle along with Brahman or Isvara Those Upanisads 57 which subscribe to the concept the female principle as constituting the Ultimate Reality, are held to be of later origin This concept is also indicated or elaborated in the Puranas and Itihāsas. In this respect, the Āgamas maintain their own concept and tradition, not shared by ancient Vedic tradition 

Admission of a Supreme Deity is closely connected with problems like God's relations to the world in respect of its

This forms part of the Khila of the Rgveda The word, 'Khila', shows that it did not form part of the Rgveda in the recension that is now available Evidently, Vyasa did not include it It could have been in some other recension which has now disappeared, and so it has a loose existence But on this ground, it cannot be treated as a later production.

INTRODUCTORY 

17 

Since God and Sakti are non-dual, there cannot be anything that could exist outside this Reality. If anything exists, it can only be an emanation of the Reality To account for the existe ence of the world, the Agamas give three cosmological accounts. Each one has a definite purpose to serve. 

The first account mentions three4 types of creation, namely, pure (suddha) mixed (misra) and impure (asuddha). The pure type is represented by the emanations of Sakti which are intended to give relief to the selves in bondage. The mixed one corresponds to the traditional kind which is described in the Purānas and according to which Brahma, Vişnu and Rudra have their roles to play in the world to be created. The impure type is akin to the evolution of Prakṛlı, more or less based on the teachings of the Sankhya system. Sakti is present in every created product in some form or other. 

The second account divides creation into six stages through which it passes. Each stage is called a sheath (kosa) 65 The first is Saktilosa in which Sakti manifests itself, but remains in its transcendental form Māyākosa is the second, which represen's the beginning of the material creation. The Prasuti- koja is the third in which Sakti gives rise to deities with the help of the three gupas. Brahma, Visnu and Rudra get their consorts during the fourth stage called Prakṛtikosa. Brahmāņda- koda is the name given to the fifth stage, which represents the evolution of the Sankhya categories. The bodies of all animate beings represent the last stage called Jivakosa. 

64. The Satkäryavāda which forms the basis of the creation theory requires to be justified while explaining the emanations of various forms from the Ultimate Reality which is pure unsullied with the three gunas of Prakrti This is possible only by admitting certain divisions in creation as pure, impure and mixed, 

65 These are different from the five kosas of the Vedantins: anna, prāņa, manas, vijñāna and änande,

The third cosmological account details sonic creation 60 which passes through six stages called varņa, kalā, tatīva, mantra, pada and bhuvans. The first stage is represented by absolute sound (Sabdabrahman) which has four stages of polarization under the names of Pară, Pasyanti, Vatkhari and Madhyamă67 Kala has five aspects,88 namely, Nivptti, Pratișthä, Vidyā, Santi and Santyalitä 'Tattva' refers to the classification of sounds and 

of the created beings. The mantra stage can be termed as lin- gistic occultism This begins from the letters which are called mātṛkās89 (a word which means mother") forming the source of all words. The pada stage70 marks four levels of consciousness, 



66. This is concerned with the creation of sound from Brahman and its development through stages.

namely, jāgrat, (waking stage), soapna (dream), suşupti (deep sleep) and turiya (transcendental state) The last one, bhuvana, consists of the material creation. Among these, varna and mantra have a direct bearing on sound and its creation. The other four are related to general cosmology. This account of creation seeks to indicate that the physical world, which is made up of the material nature and sonic nature, arise; out of the Absolute Reality, identified with Absolute Sound. Another name for this theory of creation is * adhvan' and the six courses are called sad adhvanah. 

While the above account of the third theory of creation is concerned with an admixture of sonic and material creation and therefore is objective, there is another kind of evolution repre- sented purely by sound.71 The first or primordial stage is repre- sented by the Ultimate Reality (param tattvam) and is in the form of sentience. When this Reality entertains a will to create, it manifests itself as Sakti It is also called Maya and the root- cause (karaṇabindu). This shows that Sakti is non-different from the Supreme Reality. The next stage in the evolution is the formation of Nada which is indistinct sound possessing light. From the Nada emanates the supreme Bindu (Para), which represents the primary stage of creation. Out of this evolve the lower Bindu and Bija. From the lower Bindu a lower kind of Nada is produced, representing the creation of the sound of the letters; and the Bija is the source for the tattoas of the material wolrd. 

These two accounts of the third kind of creation have significant meaning. Other systems of thought hold sound to

have sprung rrom ākāśa, akañkāra, vāyu and other sources. This does not explain the important role which mantras play in wor- ship nor show how God could be taken as ex's'ing in mantras. A better exposition is therefore attempted by the Agamas, which seek to trace the origin and development of mantras from the Ultimate Reality. 

The individual self (jiva) is represented by the sixth kosa callid fiva-kota It is therefore part of Absolute Reality Sakti manifests itself in several kinds of evolutes which are insentient and sentient, the latter being represented by the selves. The selves are admitted to be karma-ridden, and the evolution of Sakti is only to help them in freeing themselves from bondage, 

Liberation consists in the self obtaining proper enlighten- ment about the essence of the Supreme Reality. In other words, the self has to realize that it is part of Sakti which is not d ff.r- ent from God The schools of Agamas hive different inter- pretations of the nature of liberation which is based on this concept of the self being a part of and emination from Sakii The self merges into Sakti and so has no existence apart from God.72 Others hold that, being sentien', the self even then bas individuality, with transcendental existence 73 

The self gets to this stage through enlightenment acquired by divine grace which is called Saktibita 74 a word indicative of the role played here by Sakti. Karma, jñana and yoga are the means to win the grace of the Divine. 

The yoga section of the Agamas discusses the methods which a self has to adopt to know the real nature of the Ultimate Reality. They are based on the Toga-sūtras of Patanjali. The

INTRODUCTORY 

21 

A gamas recognize that, within the human body, there are alx cakras (or circles)75 with the names of Mulädhära, Svadhisthāna, Maṇipūra, Anahata, Viduddha, and Ãjñā, placed one above the other, the first one being placed below the navel, and the last at the top of the head All of them are said to be in the form of lotuses There are several ducts (nd dis) inside the body among which an arterial duct is called Susumna and is held to be the most important, Ida is another important duct to its right, while Pingald runs to its 1.ft. The Sușumnă duct connec's the Muladhara with the Ajna. The jivasakti les coiled like a serpent in the Mulädhāra. 

The self has to adopt yogic practices to arouse this sleeping Sakti which is called Kundalini and make it rise up through the duct of Susumnā, pass through the circles", and ultimately reach the Brahmarandhra, the middle cavity at the top of Suşımnă. At this stage, the self would merge with the Supreme Sakti and have a direct experience of bliss. In order to adopt this method, the self has to practise various postures (asanas) and carry out breath-control (prāṇāyāma). The Ida and Pingala ducts play a prominent role in präṇāyāma. The method of yoga as recommended in the Agamas envisages a self which acquires the knowledge of reality to find the Absolute in himself, since God is not absent from anywhere and is not distinct from Sakti, The aspirant is therefore required to have experience within himself and, as such, this concept has appeal only to a limited number who could adopt yogic practices 

The next section is called Kriyāpāda, which is concerned with the making of images, construction of temples and instal- lation of the images there. The gods are represented in the Vedas as displaying or possessing distinct features so as to be definitely

Identified and distinguished. Certain features displayed by some gods were held in common by more than one deity. This led to the formation of the concept of all-deities * (viśvedevāḥ)78 and to the evolution of a monotheistic tendency making the gods as subordinate in position to a Supreme God whose various manifestations they were taken to represent. 

It is hard for an aspirant to have concentration on the features of a god who is not present before him whenever he requires. The need therefore arose to evolve a concept which would admit of the form of the particular god who is to be meditated upon. God has been conceived of by the Vedic seers 

03 

all-pervading (sarvavyāpin) and also transcendental 77 Another principle which is involved in the conc.pt of God- head is that He is also immanent78. These aspects have made it possible for evolving a new concept according to which God, who is infinite and beyond all kinds of temporal, spiritual and objective limitations, and who, for that reason, could not be described and depicted accurately with the instruments of measurement and evaluation that are finite, becomes accessible to man by taking a physical body in the shape of an idol. Along with the idol, there also came into existence the mystic diagrams drawn to specific scales on metals or other materials with the letters of the mantra relating to the particular deity being set in specified spots. 

This concept of admitting a finitized form for the Infinite Supreme Being is based on two assumptions. God can make

Himself manifest at any time at His own will. The manifested form is as much God's as the ut manifested one is. God pre- sents Himself in this form for the sake of His devotee, and so God's presence in the idol cannot be questioned. Secondly, God's immanence, when it is displayed in the idol, cannot also be explained away. Therefore, the finitized form of God as idol must be taken to have been known to Indians from very ancient times on the authority of the Agamas, 

The various deities were worshipped by the Vedic seers by making offerings of ghee, butter and other materials in the sacred fire, whenever specific desires were needed to be fulfilled. The worshipper was well aware that his particular desire would be granted if a particular deity was worshipped The relation ship between the worshipper and the deity was based merely on this understanding. People who used to know this and realized It, must have felt in course of time that there existed between them and the particular deity an intimate relation which was drawing them both close to each other. This gave rise to the feeling of dependence on the god, which developed into one of affection. Affection gradually resulted in the rise of devotion in man for the god. Man could not then live aloof from that deity. He desired to offer his oblations to that deity in the fire. It is not unnatural then that he should have desired to see his god before him. A devotee should, indeed, expect to perceive his god in a form which his finite senses could easily comprehend The form with which the god presented himself to his devotee, must have been cherished as his essential form. Those who had visions like these of the same god would not have allowed that attractive figure to go away from their sight. They were not sure of having it again, if it vanished from their presence Naturally, they should have taken steps to shape, out of any material they had, whether mud, stone or metal, a figure that would represent that form in the idol carved out by them So it is the devotion of the worshipper that has brought about the concept of the idol and idol worship.24 

AGAMAS AND SOUTH INDIAN VAISNAVISH 

The seer who used to feel that his transactions with a deity whom he worshipped by making offerings into the sacred fire were ended after that act of worship was completed, did not any longer ponder over the identity of that deity, as there was no need thereafter for continuing the worship When that deity was represented in an idol, the deity was always there before the worshipper, attracting his mind and senses Emo- tions surged into his mind, taking the forms of gratitude for the favours received and attraction to the beauty of the person of the deity. The m nd was enraptured with the ravishing beauty of the god. The worshipper could no longer allow himself to forget that form or ignore the presence of the deity there. 

The idol is God Himself. Awareness that God is supreme, possessing countless qualities, powerful, amiable and easy of access to the worshipper, gives rise to affection and passionate longing for God. Naturally, the worshipper would erect a place for keeping the idol, decorate that place and see that nothing affects its sanctity This is the starting point for th: rise of the section called Kriyāpāda in the Agamas. 

Steeped in the Vedic traditions, the seers could not ignore the significance of the Vedic mantras which, on being repeated by them, brought forth the deity before them The mantras were therefore used for all purposes connected with the worship of the idol, 

The feeling of attachment for an object fills the human heart and arouses there a desire to keep that object well-secured in a safe place. When that feeling is enlivened by the spirit of devotion, attempts are made by the owner of that object to beautify it and enshrine it in a place that is also embellished with all artistic designs in consonance with the beauty of the object. Every possible attempt is made to adopt all devices for the main purpose of providing that object with a charming enviroment. It is in this sense that Hindu iconography, sculpture, painting and architecture are said to have had a divine origin. These fine arts were primarily intended for God.

The selection of the proper site for the erection of the temple, excavating it, preparation of the bricks, raising of the basement and other preliminaries are dealt with in detail in the Kriyapada Choice of stones, erection of pillars, building the halls and construction of the temples are then described. The temple is treated as Puruşa, the humanized Supreme Being The cosmos is conceived to be present abstractly and also in concep tion 79 So, the temple is constructed with specific numbers of halls, courtyards and other structures, with all the deities represented there in the form of images and specified places. This explains why the sanctum sanctorum is called 'garbhagrha”. The size of the towers, the storeys in the towers and the temple structure should be uniform, but In proportion to the size of the chief idol to be enshrined in the temples. Rules are given for the selection of stone, wood or metal for making the idols. After the idols are carved, an initial ceremony called adhivāsa is to be performed. Then the eyes are carved for the idol followed by an elaborate process of installation. After this, the idols become sanctified and fit for worship. Methods of off. ring daily worship to the deity are then treated. Vedic mantras are to be recited while attending to all this work. 

Similarly, every person is required to offer worship to God in his residence. The procedural details for this purpose are also contained in this section of the Agamas The idol, the sālagrāma, the linga and the mystic diagram are required to be worshipped in the house in accordance with the aptitude, capacity and economic conditions of the worshipper. 

The fourth section which is called Caryapada prescribes the rules for carrying out the daily routine of the aspirant and for attending to the worship of God in temples and houses and conducting general, private and public festivals Most of the texts of the Agamas contain a more detailed exposition of this

section than others, ladicating the ulterior purpose of the Agamas. This section lays stress on the practical side of their teachings.

The worship of God is to be conducted through mantras, which are constituted of letters or rather, syllabic sounds. These represent the power of God 80 Each letter has a deity. An aspirant has to choose the letters which get moulded into the form of a mantra and use it for worshipping his deity Any set of letters or any word is not a mantra The letters have to be such as to form a word which could become a mantra. Each letter in that manha reveals only an aspect of God who is to be represented by it Only when the whole mintra gets formed, the full form of God would become available there. This is like a particular formation of letters which, becoming a word, would convey meaning. Mantra manifests God and thus stands for God whose presence is felt there. Mantras and D ty become one and the same. The letters of the mantra become the yntra of God So mantra's pantra or an id. I of God The yantra or idol cannot therefore be a mere piece of stone or metal To produce this manifestation of the deity in the yantra or idol, the mantra must be intonated in the most accurate way prescribed in the Agamas in respect of both sound and rhythm. Any attempt to render it in another language would reduce it to the status of a mere word, possessing simply physical properties. Such translated words may have the status of prayers, but mantras alone have the power to compel the deity to appear before the aspirant. 

The letters, which form mantras, are called mäirkas, as they form the basis of words. They are classified under different heads. A pedestal for them (mitskapitha) is required to be prepared with specific dimensions and a diagram is to be drawn to take the shape of a locus. There are specific rul.s to draw the forms of the letters in the petals in accordance with the mantra of the denly to be worshipped.

The characteristic feature of the mantra is consciousness and is said to be of four parts,81 namely, bija, pinda, säṁjñā and pada The bija may contain either one or two vowels coupled with a consonant. It constitutes the essential part of the particular deity's mantra. The prapava, krim, drim, aim, klim. and such others illustrate the bija. The consonants, inserted between the bija and the remaining part, constitute the pinde. Yowels also are sometimes connected with it: im represents this Samiña is the name of the particular deity addressed in the mantra in association with the words, names and prapava, e.g., namo Vişnave'. A combination of verbal utterance with nominal concepts of a laudatory nature gives rise to the pade section, e.g, * sahasrajvālāya'. All these four parts together constitute a complete mantra and each of these is held to be as efficacious as a mantra Such words as sodhd, vauşat and phat are used at the end of certain mantras, conveying the offering.82

Mantras of two kinds are employed in the Agemic practices, namely, vaidika and tantrika. The vaidika mantras are takes

from the four Vedas, according as circumstances demand. There are also täntrika mantras, and some which represent an admixture of both. Tn tantrika mantras are required on two grounds One is that every deity, which forms part of the re. tinue of the principal deny, requires a spec fic mantra for wor. ship, and a Vedic mantra is not always available for the purpose. S-condly, they prov de those who are not qualified to s'udy the Vedas with mantras which th y could readily ue; eg. Om hrim halaya astraya hūm phot; Om hrim aim karty n namh ; sadoditānandavigrahaya krim klım soāhā The Vedic mantras are adapted for länrik purposes. For instance, there ar Gayahi mantra:83 for several deities on the model of the Săvil·l mantra. The Revedic mantra Svasti na Indro Vṛddhasravih* (1 89 6), is adipted as 'hrim hūm svasti naḥ Käljäyani Āporṇa'. These. mantras have to be repeated (as japa) in order to attain success. (siddhi). 

✡ 

Those who adopt the tantrika made of worship are required to undergo initiation84 (diksd) und r a preceptor who is well up in the subject. The qualifications are prescribed for the pupil and the preceptor. Initiation (dikṣā) is not simply giving lectures or guiding the apprentice in doing a pi ce of work, but transference of the supreme power wh ch resid.s in has body into the body of the pupil. 

There are several items to be gone through while offering worship of God. Worship of God is f two k d 85 nimely, internal (antaryaga) and external (baya yaga). Tue puant is required to look inward and find God there The entire procedure of worship as practised internally is to be gone through and, after the inner worship is over, external worship Is to be undertaken.

INTRODU 

20 

The first step to be adopted before actually beginning the Inner or subjective mode of worship is the purification of the elements in the body of the aspirant (bhūtasuddhi)86 This consists in imagining the earthy element of the body being absorbed into the subtle element characterised by smell (gandha-tanmātrā); which is to be merged in water, which io Ite turn in the subtle element characterised by taste (rasa-lanmåtrā) and so on till the body gets into the mind, that into life and that into matter Matter is to be absorbed in the Supreme Being. In the reverse order, a new body is gradually imagined to be created, a body which is made up of pure saliva, so an to be free from the impurities which arise on account of the ragus and tamas of matter. This new body then gets fit for worshipping God. 

The human body, which is made up of matter, is regarded as impure. The ancient texts tend to depict the body as reprehensible,87 The question that would generally be raised in the context is as to how the perfect idol or diagram of God, sancufied by the utterance of mantras, can be touched by the impure hand of man and offered worship There is no answer to this question in any ancient work except what is suggested in the Agamar. By this process of bhūta-suddhi, an aspirant is made to imagine that he gets rid of his impure body and obtains a pure frame with which he could offer worship 10 God This at once suggests that the body which has become perfect and flawless through this mental process is fully quali fied and competent to offer worship. Hence the Agamas have gone beyond the Vedas in suggesting that the human body is not so detestible as it is held to be. One should rather attach value and respect to the body which acquires the unique privilege in

this life for handling the idol or diagram and offering worship to 

It directly. 

After carrying out bhatafuddhi, the aspirant should imagine that he offers worship to God within himself, passing through all the stages of worship and using the materials which are also Imagined to have been procured there for the purpose This mental worship enables the aspirant to feel happy that God within him has been worshipped by him and helps him in preparing himself for the external mode of worship. 

Apart from collecting the widely used materials of worship such as the vessels, bell and others, the Agamas insist on certain preliminaries to be gone through before the actual act of worship is begun. 

Among them, the mengala88 is a pictorial representation of the descent of the Supreme Reality on earth at the spot where God is to be worshipped. This takes the form of drawing certain figures on the ground. The figures generally take the form of a lotus with a specific number of petals. Each figure has particular spo's assigned for various deities with the chief deity taking its place in the centre. In general, a mandala can be us.d for any deity. With an artistic background, the maṇḍalo is treated as the place to be worshipped. This is generally used on occasions when pavitydropane, initiation and other rites are undertaken. 

Tentre89 plays a prominent part in the Agamas The word, * yantra' which is derived from the root 'yam' meaning 'to restrain", conveys the sense that the yantra is capable of sub- duing lust, anger and other i. purities which affect the self. Is

restrains the self from falling a victim to vice and fixes its atten- tion on the deity. Generally, it takes the shape of a diagram drawn on paper, engraved on metals or cut on crystals and stones. Tantras vary in design according to the deities they represent and whose mantras have their syllables written or carved there in specific places. The yantra is said to be the body of the deity which is mantra itself. 

Vide: 

qi angad då gearear taða fr tenantfar dat gratuanteaur # 

(Cited in Sabdakalpadruma, Pt. IV. p. 13.) 

While mandalas could be used for any delty, the yantra is concerned only with a particular deity All yantras have common edging called bhūpura, which is a quadrangular figure with four doors on each side. These doors are intended to isolate the yantra from the outside world. The worshipper meditates upon God and arouses Him within himself. He then transfers Him to the yantra which becomes His body. The yantra is then no longer gross matter It becomes fit to be worshipped. This transference of God into the yantra is stated to be Pranapratistha,90 as the deity is infused with life there. 

The yantra becomes thus the concrete presence of the deity. The syllables of the mantra of the deity are still there, representing the deity. Meditation, repetition of the mantra and the act of worship are all done with reference to the yantra. Though concretized, the deity is not visualized in the yantra by all the aspirants. Hence this principle of the yantra is extended in its application to the idol of God which represents Him in physical form, acceptable and attractive to the eyes and minds of the aspirants. The idol, made of stone, wood, minerals, or metals, does not have the syllables of the mantre served on IL

Sometimes, however, the idol may be installed on a yantra specifically prepared for the purpose, 

Nydse 91 is a practice enjoined by the Agamas Sounds have particular deities. They are also located in the human body. The sound, presided over by a particular deity, must be identified with the one present in the body. This is fine by touching that part of the body where it is located with the tip of a particular finger in the right hand and its palm This is called Nyā、a. While doing this, the mantra of the particular delty must be uttered. Thereby, the body of the aspirant is considered to get filled up with the life of the deity This Nyasa is called mantranyasa, which makes the aspirant acquire fitness to worship that deity. It is a mental process which removes the obstacles which lie in the path of offering worship to the deity When it is done on one hand with another, it is called Flastanyäsa or Karanyäsa, 

This is to be followed by doing it on the body, when it is called Anganyă sa The latter is said to be of five kinds 92 the limbs on which nyata is to be done being hṛdaya, šikhā, d'ras, astra and kavaca. When this is to be done on the yantra and idol, they are held to possess these limbs. The aspirant who spiritul zes his body by Nyasa, infuses the potency of the mantra into the idol on which he performs Nyāsa 

He must spiritualize the limbs of the idol and the interior of the idol also the Nyasa is thus both ext rnal (bahir) and int rnal (antas). Nyāta is also done with a view to create a new potency in the idol. It is of three kinds, sa ĥhāranyasa, sṛştınyaia and sthitinyasa,93 Nyasa is required to be done on almost all

Writing which includes painting gestures which convey the intention of those who display them and articulate spc-ch have been, from a very ancient period of humin histo y, the meins which men have adopted for communicating with one another. Among these, speech in the form of articulate expression 's most w.dely usd, while writing com s nex in importa ice ✪ s'ures, unaccompanied by words, do convey sense.

It is therefore natural that both in practical life and in artistic presenta lons such as dince, the poses with the phy i al limbs should play a dominant role. The same principle is appli cable to the employm nt of mudras in worship. Varada, abhiya- hasta, vyakhyāmudrā and och kinds of mudrds are found to be shown by icons and painted and sculptur d figures, adding much to their communicative eff ctiveness Similarly, the aspirant is erjoined to employ the mudras, while performing worship.

This must apply also to the people who lived in ancient India. This society did not certainly migrate into India from without Practices of the people should have varied, and the different practices could have reacted on one another Citiin of them might have been taken up by a section which did not have themb fore. These practices have been there ever since the enlightened secrion of people had their own way of religious and secu'ar life fully orginız.d. The foreign or tribal origin of the Agamas does not therefore merit acceptance The sources for the Agamas must therefore be admitted to have bren vinted but Indian, nermitting the volaris of the various culs to draw out whatever they required. Besides mutual influence, exotic impact cannot be totally denied. 

The Himalayan regions 10 where Kai'as is situated, are said to have b.en the home of the Sawa Agamas Sɔme think 105 that it is from Bengal the Agamas spread to A`sam, Nepal, Tibet and China.

received worship in particular places. The passage in the Mahabharata makes a general reference to the gods, which shows that deities other than Visņu had their idols in temples for worship. The Puranas contain references to the temples of these gods All this indicates that idol worship, as enjoined in the Agamas, must have been very ancient The structures to house these deities could have sprung up later, of which alone the Puranas have references and descriptions. 

It must not be surprising, if references in the Ramayana to the various spots in hermitages for many deities should turn out to be Agamle without any tinge of the use of yantras and tantrika mantras. The opüha doctrine of the Pancaratra refers to the names of Krsna and the members of His family. This may be a later addition made at the end of the Doaparayuga. Or, those names, which should have been in vogue long before that period, could have been given to the members in the family of Krypa, just like the name * Vasudeva' Anyway, the Mahā- bharata which must have taken a specific shape by 3000 BC 125 should justify this date as the lowermost limit for the prevalence of the Agamic doctrines
