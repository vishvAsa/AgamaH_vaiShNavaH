The Agamas, as a whole, are based on the Vedas, and their concept of God is derived from them It is but natural that the Supreme Deity should be depicted as formless and beyond comprehension The finite Instruments of man and of his powers are totally inadequate to measure God and His powers 1159 God becomes an object of adoration, and so He is represented as an embodiment of lovable qualities and bliss, 1160 thus indicating the result of a development that is only of Agamic origin 

This concept of God should naturally be consistent with a way of worship that would be practicable for those who believe In it. Hence the Āgamas invariably prescribe yoga as the means of mokşa. Control of the mind and coucentration of the mental activities, which form part of the yogic practice, are essential for offering worship. Therefore, stress is laid quite often on meditation 1161 God, who becomes the object of meditation, is not formless but bas forms which represent different levels of realization, beginning from concrete appearance represented by the waking state and passing through the states of dream and deep sleep and culminating in the transcendental one 1162 The Ulumate Reality is therefore called Naray na in the Pañcarā tra Agamal163 and Sadavisnu in the Vaskhanasa 1184

The Sriprasnasamhitā makes an explicit reference to the later rise of offering worship to the arca form of God 1165 The Vaihhānasa Agama also classifies the act of worship as of two kinds, namely, Amūrtārcana and Samurtärcana 1166 The name of the former shows clearly that though worship (arcana) is under- taken, it is not with reference to the concrete form of God It is held that the performance of homa in the fire eonstitutes Amürtarcana According to this Agama, this is to be done on the lines prescribed in the Vaikhānasa Kalpasūtras 1167 

Both the Agamas have developed mostly with reference to the worship of God in concrete form Ene arcă form is required to be created out of specific materials 1168 Slace Visnu with Sri is considered to be the Ultimate Reality, the Image of God as Varaha paved the way for the earth to be raised to the level of a goddess called Bhudevi, identified with Pusti She too was given a status in the form of an idol to occupy a place to the left of Visnu.1169 Nila came to occupy a place under the influence of the stories of Krsna. While treating Visnu as the Supreme God, it became necessary to give other gods a due place, and so they are treated as forming part of His retinue. The idols so created for the principal deity, particularly Vişnu and His consorts and some others as well, such as Visvaksena, Hanuman, the Vibhava deitles and others, were required to be only one for each, but not more. 

The worship of God can also be done in water, kūrca (a bundle of grass used as a seat) and an idol. The tradition of

the Agamas is to treat the first one as low, the second as of the middle kind and the last as the best 1170 The idol is called bera 1171 which means 'body' The Agamas use this word quite often to refer to the idol. Worship of the Lord in the idol is said to please the eyes, mind and heart It produces devotion for Him in people who worship It. Hari is pleased and becomes accessible to Hls devotees.

This word does not occur in the Sanskrit language But it 13 found as forming part of other words 

eg, the name of Kubera, the lord 

of wealth, who is said to have a bad (deformed) body Vide

Vāyupurāna, LXX-39a Some commentators take this word to be derived from the root 'Kumb' meaning to conceal' with the suffix, 'erac' Kubera is said to conceal his wealth and keep it away from one and all Vide Bhanujıdıkşita on Nāmalıngānusāsana, I 1 68a Cf Vacaspatya pp 2104. 4969 Sabdakalpadruma, II p 144. 

This interpretation is not acceptable, for it does not explain how the word 'bera' has come into being The origin of this word is still 

mysterious, 

The Agamas use the words 'bera", and mürtı' in the sense of the idol

Five beras, 

according to the Vaikhanasa system, called Dhruva, Kautuka, Snapana, Utsava and Bali, are required in temples. They are to be made out of various materials in specific sizes proportionate to one another 1172 Some authorities bold the Snapana and Kautuka to be of little Importance By worshipping the Dhruvabera one gets rewards hereafter and the Utsavabera gives rewards here itself 1173 

The Vaikhanasa texts seek to classify the forms of God in a different way also. They are mobile (cala) and immobile (acala) 1174 The former is required to depend upon another which is taken as represented by the kautuka-bera 1175 This is to be served with devotion upon which devotion sprouts out in the devotee, People become prosperous by worshipping this form. The other form is also called niskala 1176 It does not depend upon a concrete form It is represented by the Dhruvabera, This form is mainly intended for the worship of the recluses 1177

The need to have an Image from its position accounts Dhruvabera But the grace of God is not restricted to be received only by the arcaka or the devotees who visit the temple. There are persons who may be ill and can not move out of their homes For their benefit, an image is required to be taken in procession through the streets This accounts for another image whose size must be in some prescribed proportion to that of Dhruvabera It is called the Utsavabera The occasions for taking this image around the locality must be determined. Hence certain days or periods in the year are particularised when festivals can be celebrated with pomp Again, there is

the need to offer a ceremonial bath every day to God. This can. not be done without much inconvenience So an image called the Snapanabera is intended for the purpose. The Dhruva and Utsava beras have ablutions generally once a week on a fixed day of on specific occasions, The Snapanabera is also called Tirthabera and is taken for immersion in the sacred waters of a tank or river or sea when the annual or any other festival concludes, the occasion being called avabrtha An image called Kautukabera or Karmabera is Installed for which offerings of flowers, (arcana) are made daily. Lastly, it is necessary to have a Balibera which is to be taken round for making offerings at fixed places in the temple. 

The Valkhanasa kind of worship, at it is now in practice, does not keep the distinction between the Utsava and Kautuka beras The offerings (arcana) are made direct to the Mulabera and Kautukabera 1177 

The Pañcaratra mode of worship has a Sayanabera, used to show God as taking rest at night at the end of the routine of dally worship. The Vaikhanasa mode permits the Snapana or Bali bera to be used for this purpose. Some Pōñcarātia texts speak of a Tirthabera as the sixth idol used on specific occasions. 

It is hard to understand how and why the present practice arose of keeping only four or three beras in the temples Including the major ones. It is found that one of the beras like the Snapana is used to serve the purposes of another which was perhaps not made or lost in course of time no strong justification for keeping both the beras as suggested In certain texts The 

There seems to be Tirtha and Snapana reference in the

Vişoaksena-samhita 1178 to Karma, Nitya and Tarunalaya is also vague, unless some kind of justification is to be offered for keeping them 

There are rules which prescribe the size of each bera, the metals out of which they are to be made and the methods and times of worship Among them, the Dhruvabera is also called the Mulabera, as it represents figuratively the root out of which a tree is evolved, in which the Utsava-bera represents the flower and the other three the leaves. The utmost significance is therefore given to the installation of the Dhruva-bera There are certain postures like Sthiti, Asana, Sayana and others for this 1179 Specific ornaments and weapons are required to adorn these idols 

In the making of these idols, the materials will have to be examined and selected, so as to bring prosperity for the maker, the priest and the people of the locality also Artistic form Is to be achieved while making the image. God, however, takes the form which the maker or the priest or the devotee eagerly prays to God to take up

The idols are to be installed in specific places with elaborate preparations of materials using the particular mantras enjoined In the Agama texts for each deity and for each bera The kind of grains to be used for preparing the food offerings, the quantity of the Ingredients, the kind of flowers to be culled for offering to God, the materials to be brought for each pitcher (kalasa) whose number varies according to the occasions and which are used for ablution (snapana) of the idol and the number of offerings to be made to suit the occasions are all dealt with 

in these texts. 

To house the idols, the sanctum sanctorum is to be built with enclosures of varying number, quadrangles, courtyards and halls with towers with specified numbers of storeys. Rules are laid down differently in different texts for installing the gods who form the retinue of the principal deity in particular enclosures 

Worship done to the idol is stated in the Vaikhānasa 1180 texts to be of two kinds, Santika and Paustika, the former bringing about the removal of evils of all people, while the latter is conducive to their welfare. 

Worship of God is called yajña which suggests that it is Vedic in character. It is of two kinds. worship in the temple and worship at home. Worship in the temple is extolled to be the best. It will not stop, even if the priest who performs it passes away It is conducive to the welfare and prosperity of the people of the locality This classification is also called

svärtha and parärtha 1181 The former corresponds to worship done in the house and the latter to that done in the temple. 

The Vatkhanasa text called Vasadhikāra offers another classification into pure and mixed The former is that which is done in the house by one who observes all the forty sacraments prescribed in the Vaskhānasa-kalpasūtras. The Idol to be worshipped must be installed in the house and the worshipper must perform homa dally in the fire, and he should not perform worship in the temple. The worship done in the temple for others' sake, following strictly the procedure laid down in the Agamas, is of the mixed kind

According to the Vaikhanasa Agama, only those who, by birth, belong to the Varkhanasa sutra, are eligible to worship in temples Investiture with the sacred thread (upanayana) is the only qualification, which only Brahmins can have Others are forbidden from having this right, whatever be their caste or sex If such persons touch the idol, even by accident, expiatory rites have to be performed 1185

who is to attend to worship, is called *ācārya' in th's system Besides being a follower of the Vaikhānasa-sūtra, he must be a householder with a wife and children Study of the Vedas and training in the performance of Srauta rites and expiatory rites, diligence in discharging his duties and, above all, abiding devotion to Visnu, mark him as competent for the work in the temple In addition to atten ling to his work in the temple, he must also offer worship to God in his house 1186

The pupil must have amiable qualities, be able to receive and retain what is taught to him and live according to the tradition with faith in God 1199 Initiation is open to any caste and even women are eligible, if they get their husbands" permission 1200

Initiation is twofold according to the economic condition of the pup!! A well-to-do candidate gets it done on an elaborate scale. For one who is not well off, homa is done in the fire with seeds of sesamum, for the penniless oral Instruction 1204 is enough. No one who makes a request for it may be denied.1205 There is another classification into ordinary and special Mantras are merely used in the former kind which admits of three further subdivisions, condensed, normal and elaborate 1206 The special kind is fivefold The Samayins and youngsters whose hearts are set on Visnu get the first kind. The second is open to maldens and Putrakas. The third is prescribed for the Sadhakas who wish to obtain moksa. The Acāryas must adopt the fourth to attain sayujya.

The pupil must be pure and free from temptations. A samhāranyasa is done by the preceptor on the body of the pupil In order to get rid of the impurities there belonging to prakrti. The body then becomes pure when the teacher does śrstinyā‹a there. This is followed by sthitinyasa when the mantra is taught which does not leave the pupil on any account 1208 The preceptor does this at first on his body so as to make himself mantramaya and then he does this on the body of the pupil.1209 

The mantra is then raught to the pupll which he is to practise with faith and diligence 1210 To do this, he has to undertake japa, homa, tarpana, abhişeka and viprabhojana, All these are collectvely called Purascarana, 1211 

There is yet another division of initiation as gross, subtle, and absolute All the three are called mantradikṣā 1212 for which the pupil must have got himself qualified in the practice of mantras. Thereupon, the adept will give initiation in the principles (lattoa). The entire process 19 highly intricate to understand 1213 The pupil will have to occupy the maṇḍalas, especially, the cakrābja-mandala.

It is thus found that all are qualified for initiation. In this eontext, it is worth considering what the word kṛtalaksana means in a passage already cited from the Mahabharata.1215 It means those who have the 'mark' This mark' (annot be getting initiated, but something else by which one getung it becomes eligible to do worship to God This mark may be that which is made on the shoulder blades of the pupil by the teacher with the heated symbols of the conch and discus. It may be the urdhoapundra. Anyway, both these show the wearer of them as a Vaisnava Ancient texts 1216 declare these as easential for doing worship to God 

Some of the later Samhitas 1217 mention the sacrament of pañcasamskāra as Included under Initiation, calling it a dîkṣā. Ancient texts, however, do not refer to this. Though it is necessary to qualify a person for worshipping God, it is not initiation, nor can it be considered a qualification for a priest to offer worship in a temple,1218 

He 

The acarya is one of the four kinds of adepts for dīksā is virtually the director for giving guidance to those who participate in the installation ceremonies Thus, he is not an ordinary priest The duciples, assistants and arcakas work under his direction He must therefore be well-versed in the theory and practice of the Agamic works Including that relating to the building of the temples.

The act of worship is conceived in the Agamas as yāga 1219 The Pañcaratra bas specific rules laid down for this. The Vaskhanasa follows the rules laid down in the Vaikhanasakalpa- sutras. The cakrābjamandala is to be used for the performance of the rituals, which are classified into seven kinds :-yāga, stoma, mahāyāga, adhoara, sava, kratu and haristoma What precedes in this order is of less importance than what follows it. These are to be performed respectively by the Samayin, Diksıta, Cakravartin, Abhisikta, Guru, Acārya and Bhagavān 1220 

The Agamas are concerned also with the well-being of the people. This is evidenced from the directions contained in them for laying down the roads in the villages where the temples are to be constructed.1221 The Aparajitaprecha, Silparatna, Kasyapa-sılpasūtra, Tantra-samuccaya, and many others treat, among other topics, temple-building with architectural details and other allied topics However, what they contain do not accord well with the Agamic treatment in all details Several methods could have been utilised by the Agama texis to serve their purposes They are not actually concerned with the details of construction, materials and measurement They are interested primarily in maintaining the ritualistic aspect in the building programmes Architectural detalls are therefore not fully available in the texts 

An individual or a group of persons or a rich landlord or a king is referred to as yajamāna or bhakta if he takes the initiative

by providing the means for the building of a temple. Any one cannot become a yajamāna,1222 

Under the director, artisans have to work. They are referred to by the words, rathakāra”, “ Silpın', 'sthapati' and 



' taksaka". Among them, the Silpin works as a liaison agent between the director or the acarya and the yaramana. The qualifications of these are stated in texts like S'ilparatna,1223 

A mantra is 

Mantras play a significant role in the Agamas sound with which one associates oneself in the belief that it would protect thim. It protects from all dangers one who knows its secret 1224 Since the mantra emanates from sound, and sound arises from Brahman, the mantra should denote God alone. The pupil who receives the mantra from the preceptor should practise the ritual performance called puraścarana This is to be done on the bank of a great river, or in a temple or a forest or a place which is out of public sight Full effects cannot be achieved unless the aspirant repeats the mantra a specific number of times 1225 

There are many kinds of mantras For instance, tāraka is a mantra which saves the devotre from worldly suffering. It is with reference to a male deity. But it is called tārikā when it refers to a female deity. There are others such as anutāra, anutārikā,

For the installation ceremony a hall is to be built for performing homa this is the yagasala. The sacred fires vary according to the deities to be installed Ahavaniya, anvāhārya, gārhapatya, āvasathya and sabhya are the five fires according to the Vaikhanasa

This process is called adhiväsa 1268 In the meanwhile, God's presence is invoked in jars filled with consecrated water. The Idols are then taken out and carried behind the arcakas who go in advance bearing the jars of consecrated water to the inner shrine where the dhruvabera is already stationed The idols are kept In the places assigned to them They are all sprinkled with the waters beginning with the dhruvabera which becomes veritably

But in some temples1283 of the Pancarätra kind, the club is absent and the figure is identical with that in the Vaskhanasa temples It seems that the mode of worship should have changed from Pañcaratra to Vaskhanasa and vice-versa during the 17th century when the idols were removed to plices of safety to save them from the Muslim forces which attacked south India. 

The Pañcaratra Agama attaches importance to the oyuha concept and speaks of the installation of these deitles 1284 Five mārtis and vīras are required to be installed according to the Varkhanasa Agama,1285 However, they do not appear to have been installed as such la the temples nor are they found to receive daily worship.1288 Besides, both the Agamas enjoin the Installation of the vibhava forms of God. But there also, only some get represented such as Narasimha, Rama and Krsna in temples where the principal deities are other than these. 

The Vaikhanasa Agama in particular enjolas the installation of Matsya and Kürma avatāras in villages, the sea-shore, forests and bille There must be no kautuka imige for the dhruva bera of these, 1287 

Some vibhava forms are of more than one type Varaha is of three klods-Adivaräha, who rescu-1 the earth from the nether regions and whose face only should be that of the boar, as at Srimuspam near Chidambaram, Pralaya-varaha who saved the

Girlja and Sthunaja are two forms of Narasimha. The former represents the Lord's descent to the earth on the representations of the gods about their sufferings at the hands of the demon, Hiranyakasıpu After killing the demon, He stayed in forests on the hills His wrath was appeased by the prayers of the gods.

Laksmi-narasimha has Laksmi seated on His lap Patala- narasimha is seated on Garuda There is one reference to form seated on Adisesa and known as Yanaka-narasimha. 

Trivikrama has three forms. In one, He has eight arms with the left foot raised to the height of the head In another, the left foot is raised to the height of the navel. The third form shows the left foot raised to the height of the forehead. Krsna also has many forms-Navonitanata (dancing with butter in hands), Parthasarathi (as charloteer of Arjuna) and Kāliya- mardana (killing the venomous serpent, Kaliya) He is also known with four arms The Idol of Vasudeva may be of two kinds-divine (divya) and human (mānusa) The former has four hands of the Vaikhānasa kind, while the latter is two-handed.

recited during worship. Homa is to be performed in the fire of the triangular form of the fire-altar which is kindled by the fire of his sentience. The procedure is the same AS In external worship 1292 

The external form of worship is to be undertaken after arranging for the vessels, materials and other requisites. Vaidika and Tantrika mantras, mandalas etc. (according to the Agama) are required to be made use of here. Vinayaka is to be worshipped at the outset,1293 There are six stages which mark this mode of worship, namely, Mantra sana, Snānāsana, Alajkārāsana, Bhojyāsana, Mantrāsana and Paryańkāsana. Al the first stage, one has to offer oneself and one's belongings to God.1294 During the second stage, dance, music and recitation of mantras have to be performed during the holy bath given to the idol.1295 Sandal paste, flowers and other offerings are to be made during this stage. Incense bas to be burnt and offered to God Apart from dance and music, auspicious songs must be sung, 1296 

In this context, it is to be noted that the present-day practice of offering mantrapuspa is based on this mandate in the Agamas The offering according to current usage includes the reeltation of the initial mantras of the four Vedas, to be followed

by upanisadic passages glorifying Narayana and the Aṣtakṣara- mantra Passages are then recited from the Rāmāyaṇa, Mahabharata, Viṣṇupurana and other sacred texts. Portions from select stanzas from the Nalayira-divyaprabandha and the Stotraratna of Yamuna and other Acāryas are then to be recited. The Vaikhanasa texts do not enjoin the recitation of the Nalayira-dıoyaprabandha, but the Pañcaratra works refer to the singing of passages composed in bhāsā, meaning 'non-Sanskrit languages • 1297 Some texts actually refer to the Azhvārs' compositions which are to be sung,1288 

One is that 

Two features are worth noting in this context the Agama texts do not speak of the recitation of the Vedic passages on this occasion In all probability, during the period after Yamuna and perhaps Rāmānuja, too, the system should have been evolved, so as to give due place for all passages which are held to be eulogistic (stuti) of God. Commencing from the Vedas, these include the Tamil prabandhas and also the stotras of Yamuna and other ācāryas 1299 Another feature that is striking is that the Agamas state that the arcaka must recite many maniras 1300 during worship, which include the Purușasūkta, Jstante stotra and others. The practice, which obtains now, is the recitation of all these by others as well who are qualified

This practice is also to be noted during snäna when not only the Purusasukta and Upanisads, but also passages from the compositions of Perlyāzhvār (Viṣnucitta) are recited by all those assembled in the temple. Such a practice could be taken to have been Introduced about 1000 A D or even later during the period of Rāmānuja. It is worth noting here that the Nityagrantha of Ramanuja and that of Stiranga- nārāyaṇārya do not make specific mention of this practice.1301 

This stage is followed by Bhojyäsana in which food prepara- tions are to be offered These are called havis and are to be sanctified by the astra mantra Surabhimudra must be shown and then the havis offered to God To compensate any lapse in the offerings, mātrā, a special preparation made of rice, is to be offered Mantrāsana recurs again whe fruits and betels are offered The Lord is also to be adored with dance and music 1302 

Here again, a practice, not mentioned in the Agamas, has come into vogue in temples A few passages from the compositions of Gɔda (Ândal) and Visnucitia (Perlyāzhvär) are sung by way of prayer for continued service of this kind and as mangalāśāsana,1303 a sort of benediction for the Lord's glory to continue for ever This is followed by a few Sanskrit passages glorifying the pattern of worship enjoined by 

1301 The Nitya of Ramanuja and the Ārādhanakārıkā of Vangipurattu Nambi prescribe the procedure for offering worship The Vaisnava tradition is primarily based on the work of Rāmānuja

1303 The idea of mangalāƒāsana is derived from the earnestness of the devotees to greet the Lord and hail His auspiciousness, thus wishing This for the continued availability of that vision and presence of the Lord seems to derive from a prayer of the same import addressed to Rudra. Vide RV II, 33 9 It has a full development in R. II, 25, 32b-37,374

Rāmānuja A prayer is then offered for the glory of the holy Sriranga to prosper and grow This is followed by the singing of Vazhitirunamam which means greetings for the recital of the holy name of an ācārya and praying that he should continue for centuries The followers of the Vadakalal school of Vaisnavas sing in the context the Vāzhıtirunāmam of Vedantadesika and those of the Teńkalai school that of Mana vālamahāmuni These practices are all later developments, brought in under the influence of the Tamil hymns of the Azhvars The arcakas bave no part to play here.

The six stages mentioned above together constitute the daily procedure for worship In a temple where there is more than one idol, these stages are to be taken to represent the worship offered to all the idols jointly Idols under the names, 'snāna-bera former alone gets the stage of snänäsana beras get it on fixed days in a week and occasions like ekādasī, sravaṇa, amāvāsya and others Even here, the utsava bera gets it not always in the sanctum sanctorum, but in a specified place outside it Similarly, the Alankārāsana may also be outside the ioner shrine at different places according to Occasion Normally, the Bhojyasana is offered twice once in the noon and again early in the night The second Manträsana is twice a day, once in the noon and later in the night, following the Bhojyasana The Alankärāsana marks the last stage only in the night when the sayana bera receives worship 

The six stages have therefore to be looked upon as marking the acts of worship offered to all the idols jointly on ordinary days with slight variations as the occasion demands when the utsava bera receives some of them. During all the stages, certain kinds of offerings like the arghya, padya and ācamaniya

are offered and the dhupa and dipa In the second and third. The dipa is also offered in the last two stages 1304 The act of worship is to be undertaken at all stages with the use of the bell which is stated to be of the form of Sabdabrahman 1305 

The Varkhanasa texts prescribe the method of worship on almost the same lines with some changes. A brahmacarin or grhastha is permitted to attend to the act of worship.1306 Worship of God is taken to be of two kinds, one of which relates to God as formless (nırākāra) and the other to God as having a form. Worship is offered to God on the ground as in homa, when no form is visualized, but His presence is also lavoked on the kusa seat. Formlessness also characterises His worship in water (as in a jar), in the heart and in the sun's disc 1307 

The five fires are to be used for doing homa when the five beras 1308 are to be worshipped and three fires (Iretägns) for

'S'aṭhāri' is the name given to the sandals of God fixed to a pedestal which is placed on the heads of the devotees when they visit the shrine and offer their prayers to God. It is quite possible that this was Instituted in the temples of Vişņu after the Tamil prabandhas were given importance. Sathakopa, also known as Nammazhvar, is the super-prapanna for all Vaisnavas, and it is felt that a Valspava must consider himself to be extremely blessed to have the sathari placed on his head by the arcaka Inasmuch as Sathakopa himself is known as Sathari Some of the Agamas refer to the installation of Sathari, calling it by the name of 'pādukäpratisthā ".1321 

In some Agama texts, the Azhvars and äcäryas are allowed Installation under the name, Bhaktabımba ".1322 Specific rules are prescribed to give them the forms appropriate to their birth, and install them in particular places like the prākāra, the outer quadrangle or separate shrines.

The flowers, fruits and food offered to God are stated to become unsuited for partaklog by devotees. Nirmalya is the name given to them.1325 The Agamas declare that these become defective by offering them to Visvaksena. This defect is removed by distributing It before ofering them Visvaksena 1326 

Regarding the food preparations, there are aine kinds broadly classified as utlama, madhyama and adhama, each one having three subdivisions of the same kind. The economic status of those who administer the temple, the nature of the temple as soayamoyakta and the like and the occasion, all determine the nature of the food to be prepared and offered to God. Of these nine kinds, some have necessarily to be offered,

Special worship is required to be undertaken on occasions which the Agamas enjoin. Doādasi, Amāvāsyā, Pūrṇimā, Sravana, Avatar adına (the day when the deity made His manifestation), the day on which the lunar asterism of the yajamāna falls, the Caitra and Tula Visu, Uttarāyaṇa and Dakşinayana, and the Sankrantis (the days when the sun enters divisions of the zodiac) are held to be the specific occasions when worship of particular kinds is to be offered to God. If the asterisms and tithis occupy ten näḍikäs on the next day, that day must be chosen for this worship and not the one when that asterism or tithi is not available at sunrise This worship must be undertaken on that day when the tithi is only for a very small part in the case of Ekadasi, Amāvāsyā and Doādas7,1330 The Vaikhänasa texts speak of Sravana, two Dvādasīs, Pūrnımā and Amäväsyn as Visnu dinas when special kinds of worship are required to be offered 1331 However, the practice obtaining in

This bath is called avabrtha, which also is to mark the conclusion of the festival The festival is to commence on a day so as to have avabṛtha on the days of visu, ayana, birthday of the king, birthday of the acarya who conducts the installation, eccurrence of an eclipse, monthly asterism (which may mean the day having the asterism when God made His manifestation) or the five days belonging to Visnu.1341 The festivals conducted at present are arranged to have avabrtha on one of the days mentioned here In most of the prominent temples, 1342 the conclusion on the ninth day is the day with Sravana The festival is conducted normally for nine days and duration of more than this number is rare. 1343 It

Elaborate preparations are to be made for conducting the festival. Collection of the sacred mud (mytsangraha), and sowing the seeds of various grains (ankurārpaṇa) form the preliminary rites for the conduct of any festival Dhvajārohaṇa and dhvajävarohana are the two chlef items in the festival, the former marking the commencement and the latter the conclusion of the festival. The rite connected with the former is given in @ very detailed way, sometimes taking up one chapter of the text.1345 In order to announce the commencement of the festival each day, a Parasava 1346 shall blow the conch, sound next the big drum and sound thrice the kettle-drum with the left hand and thrice with the right hand.1347 

The festival is conducted daily on all days both in the morning and evening. The deity is taken through the streets of the locality both in the morning and evening On both the occasions, homa is performed by the arcaka who undertakes the responsibility of attending to the festival Offerings are then made to the guardians of the quarters and also on the balipītha, the pedestal Intended for this and permanently built by the side of the dhvajasthambha.

With the exception of the evening on the day when the deity 18 taken around the streets in the morning in the chariot, there is procession on all days both in the morning and the evening. There are specific vehicles (vahana) in which the idol is carried through the streets. There is no direct statement in the text prescribing the use of particular vehicles on particular days in either of the sessions, of course, with some exceptions. 

The Pauskara, Jaya and Sattuata Samhitas do not treat the Mahotsava But, curiously enough, the Jaya contains additional Slokas in chapter I according to a manuscript which contains detailed information regarding the temple of God at Kañci aud the festival conducted thete annually in the Vaisakha month. It is correct as to the details now btaining in the temple However, these slokas could be taken to bave been deliberately interpolated with a view to present the greatness of this temple. Besides being considered as one of the three gems (ratna), the Jaya is very ancient and as such, should conform to the contents of the other two sambitas which do not refer to the celebration of the Mahotsava in the temples at Srirangam and Melkote, where these samhitas are followed.

The Paramesvara, 1349 Padma1350 and Isvara1351 Samhitas and Bbrgu's Kriyādhikara1352 mention the vehicles for some of the sessions, while the Sriprasna and other Samhitas1353 give the entire list All the texts are agreed upon having the elephant and horse vehicles on the sixth and eighth day of the festival in the night The car festival is held on the ninth day when cürṇābhışıka, mṛgayā and avabṛtha are also held in most of the temples, while it is held on the seventh day in some temples 1354 Curṇabhiseka is bad on the sixth day there, and mrgaya and avabrtha on the ninth day The Isuara-samhita mentions the vehicles without specific reference to their being used in the morning or the evening. It is worth while noting two striking features. One is that Garuḍotsava is held in the night in many temples and in the morning in a few. It is held on the fifth day of the festival in the night or on the fourth day in the night in some temples like Srirangam In temples as in Kan 1 and Tiruvallikkeni, it is celebrated on the third day in the morning. Secondly, the car festival is fixed for the seventh day at Kañci, Melkote, Tiruvallikken! and other places. At Kani the huge car used to get back to its destination after passing through the streets almost invariably after a delay of a few days; and in that case, the avabṛtha on the ninth duy used to get postponed. In general, it must be remarked that, except for the festivals on certain days, the pattern available in the prominent temples has influenced the system in others. The

Agamas offer only a broad outline of the conduct of the festival, leaving the laner details to be settled by the acarya (who must be well versed in the carya aspect of the Agama of the temple), according to the exigencies of the locality.

After dhuajavarohana, the utsava bera is to be taken to the sanctum sanctorum and placed near the dhruvabera 

When the vehicle with the utsava-bera, well decorated with ornaments and flowers, is being carried through the streets, no one must stand on or sit in or occupy any portion of the vehicle. An exception is made in the case of the elephant vehicle on which the acārya is to sit behind the utsava idol with the goad In his hand. The arcaka may also sit in the front part of the vehicle 1362 

As against this general rule, the acarya, according to another text, can sit in the front in all other vehicles as well 1363 Those who bear the vehicle through the streets must wear a coat and turban and be adorned with flowers and ornaments The acārya and arcaka also must wear a turban This practice has disappeared except in Srirangam in the case of the bearers of the vehicle and perhaps in Tirupati and Tirumalai where only one arcaka wears the turban. However, the acarya who occupies the elephant vehicle wears invariably a turban. 

A significant feature of the procession when the ulsava Idol Is taken through the streets of the locality in the vehicle or without it, is the recitation of the Āzhvars' compositions in its

This practice must have been introduced after Nathamuni and should have formed part of the conduct of the festival during the time of Ramanuja. That this practice was disputed in the 14th century is evident from Vedantadesika's successful effort in silencing the opponents and establishing it on firm grounds 1364 

The Agamas do not make clear as to why the composition of the Azhvärs are to be sung in the forefront. An answer to this question is suggested in the following sloka ef Vedantadesika :-

This may be conceded. But it is also possible to offer another interpretation. Silencing the arguments of the opponents is already stated in the second quarter of this sloka, and so this could not have been meant by the act of cleaning the streets Again, It is not clear as to why the respectable person who cleaned the streets should have taught the Tiruvaymozhi in particular to Vedantadesika. Cleaning the streets could symbolically represent the purification of the streets and making them fit for God's procession through them This purification is service (kainkarya) which may be mental, verbal or physical 

All the three kinds are applicable here, but 

It may preferably denote the verbal one 1366 suggested by the word (kautaskutanivartakān). This should then mean that these pious people recite some holy passages which cannot be the Vedas, as the reciters of them have to follow God in the procession. What they recite could not be simple stotras, but poems literary in formation and philosophical in import which could bear parity with the Vedas. Since the days of Na hamuni and Yamuna, the ubhayavedanta concept has been in vogue While one Vedanta is based on the Upanisads, the other is based on the Nalayıradıvyaprabandha. If the Vedas are to be recited behind the deity, the compositions of the Azhvars must be recited in front Like the Vedic mantras which have the power to cleanse anything of its Impurity and make it flawless, the songs of Azhvārs too should be deemed to have a similar power to make the streets free of all worldly Impurities and make them fit for the Lord to be carried through, Hence It would be appropriate to take the word 'vithiŝodhakakimkarān' in the sense of those who recite the compositions of the Azhars in front of the Lord Rightly enough, those who recite these compositions head the procession. The pipers and others who contribute to the music follow them. Such highly learned persons could not be mere sweepers. More cleaning the streets is not also meant here

Or, the recitation of the compositions of the Azhvars in the front may be explained in a different manner These compositions composed in Tamil do not get included in the Agamic rituals followed in the temple If there is a slip in the conduct of the ritualistic performance, samproksana is required to be done in the temple. If the Az xārs' compositions are rot recited, there is no explatory rite ordained to atone for this The priests in the temple are not worried about it 

Yet, these compositions have been offered a status equal to that of the Vedas in the conduct of dany worship and public festivals The ritual in the temple is not 

the temple is not taken to get completed, if these compositions are not sung at the intervals that are assigned by the early Acaryas 

the 

If the Dwyaprabandha should have a place in temple worship, it is necessary to attend to it without disturbing the procedural detalls that hav. been in practice and followed In accordance with the prescriptions laid down Agamas, It is worth noting here that the recitition of the Vedas is always done behind the procession, that is, after the Delty This is the case even in the temples of Siva. When the heads of religious institutions are taken 10 procession around the streets in villages and towns, the Vedas are recited behind them So also when mahāprasādas are taken round the streets and also when the bridegroom starts for the bride's house for marriage A time-honoured practice like this cannot be disturhed on any account. So the Vaisnava Acaryas chose to provide the reciters of the Prabandha with a separate place of honour in temple processions. To place them just behind the deity would amount to disturbing the hoary custom To place them behind the Veda reciters would mean that they are no better than bhajana- gosthis. The Prabandhas have been considered as Dravida Vedas, and so they were placed in front of the procession. Thus the Deity is taken in the procession which is led by the recitation of one Veda and followed by that of another. 

AGAMAS AND TEMPLES 

393 

The three Vedas, the Ekayana recension of the Veda, the Saltvate and other samhitās are to be recited to the right of the Lord and the Itihasas and Puranas to His left during processions. Others, who are grammarians and logiclans, may also join the procession, 1387 

There should be provision for good music at that time. The flute, vina and other instruments will be played upon. There will also be dancers 1368 All these are to provide attraction. The atmosphere must not be puritanic, severe and solemn. Even those who do not have much faith in God should be attracted to witness the procession. There may be people whose interest may lie only in the appreciation of music and dance. Some may like only to see the paraphernalia and the show. By witnessing these, they will have an occasion to have a look at God. This is enough for the spirit of the Agamas to provide for the conduct of the festivals.

After the return of the procession to the temple in each session, the four Vedas must be recited, to be followed by the recitation of the Tamil compositions of Āzhvārs. Then the stotras In Sanskrit and Tamil are to be sung in praise of the Lord. The practice that is now in vogue is to conclude the recitation of the Azhvars' compositions at first and then that of the Vedas.

Among other festivals which last over many days, mention must be made of the Navaratri 1369 and Adhyayana festivals. The former is to be concluded on the navami in the ¿Ã¿vayūja month. It begins on the Amāvāsyā day. As the name denotes, It is primarily intended for Sri The Lord is to be taken on the horse vehicle on the ninth day to the vahni tree (also known as sami). 1370 Now this is held on the dasami called Vijayadasami The Adhyayana festival is also called the Margasirsa festival 1371 This is done for ten days before and after Sukla Ekadasi. Visvaksena and the idols of the devotees of the Lord are brought to the presence of God. They are all worshipped by the recitation of the Vedas, Tamil Prabandhas, stotras in Sanskrit, Prakṛta and Tamil. The Tamil prabandhas are called here as the compositions (gatha) of devotees, There is explicit reference to the Näläyiradivyaprabandha in

The Vasanta utsava is held generally for seven days, but for three days in some temples. During the day, the delty is served with proper attendance suited to the climatic conditions of the season, and there is procession in the evening within or without the temple. As in the annual festival, there are ankurārpaṇa, homa and other items. There is no dhvajārohana. On the seventh day in the evening the utsava Idol is carried through the streets on the horse vehicle and the festival Is concluded by avabrtha in a tank or river early in the night. The car festival or the Garuda vehicle is enjoined in some texts, but this does not sppear to be practised in any temple.1373 

The birth-days of Sri Rama, Narasimha and Sri Krsna are celebrated when the idols of these deities are given bath and special worship is offered. Invariably, there is procession for the utsava idols of these deitles In particular, on the day following Sri Jayanti, there is a festival called Sikyotsava known as Uriyadi in Tamil 1374 The Agamas enjoin the celebrations of the birthdays of other vibhavas as well, but the present-day practice does not appear to attach much significance to them.1375

The Dipolsava in the Karttika month is enjoined to be celebrated in the texts, and the practice bears testimony to It. However, there is some disparity in the Vaskhanasa and Pañcarātra regarding the proper date for the celebration of this festival, as also those of the birth-days of Sri Rama, Sri Krsna and Narasimha. Rules about the duration of the tithi and constellations concerned account for this difference.1376 

On the day following the advent of the uttarayana (the observance of the winter solstice) on the Makara-sankranti day, there is a hunting festival in which the utsava idol is taken to a distant place Celebrations like the holy bath and others are gone through after which the Deity is brought back to the temple,1377 

The floating festival is conducted in the cold season (Mägho and Phalguna months) for nine, seven, five, three days or one day, and the utsava idol is taken in the float normally in a tank for three or five or seven rounds This is celebrated with great pomp. The float is to be respected as Adisega and so all and sundry must not touch It or occupy It.1378 The ācārya, arcakas and the Vaisnavas who render service to the Deity and recite the

Vedas are the only persons permitted to occupy it. In the float a decorated quadrangle is constructed where the utsava idol with Sridevi and Bhudevi is placed. There is to be a different float to be occupied by those who play on musical instruments and the women dancers. 1379 This is not in general practice at the present day. 

There are numerous other festivals like Dolotsava, Davanotsava. Kodai-utsava (summer festival) and others which are held each in some temples alone. Citrapurṇima, Padinettaṁ- perukku, Pallava-utsava, and others are peculiar to certain temples and to some areas only. 

An Important festival other than these is that of the birth-day of an Azhvar or Acārya, conducted for ten days Io each case, the concluding session coinciding with the birth-day. It is only la certain temples that all of them have their birth- days celebrated for ten days, Normally, each has it in his place of birth. In other places, the celebration Is conducted at least for the birth-day. Among the Azhvars, Nammāzhvär and Andal have their celebrations for ten days in all temples. Rāmānuja's birth-day is observed in every temple with great pomp. In many temples, the festival is conducted for all the ten days in honour of the birth-days of Vedantadesika and Manavāla mahāmuni. With the exception of some, the Azhvārs and ācāryas have worship with the recitation of the Vedas and Tamil compositions, all confined to the respective shrine Itself. On the last day, that is, the birthday, their idols are taken in procession through the streets with all the paraphernalia, as in the case of the Deity. In some temples, they are taken along with the Deity After the procession, they are worshipped along with the Deity whose honours are conferred on them, before they are taken to their own shrines 1380

During the procession through the streets, devotees from each house offer fruits like plantain, mango, coconut and others. The areaka has to offer them to the Lord without uttering any mantra, 1381 The devotees are to be shown God's favour by placing the Sathari on their heads,1382 People who render service on these occasions, would get the fruit of performing a sacrifice. Special benefits are assured for those who participate in the car festival.1383 The Agamas have the unique distinction of liberalism by an open declaration that the touch of the untouchable on such occasions would not give rise to any defect or pollution.

The energy of all the people should be conserved and converged to bestow pointed attention on the conduct of the festival of God No other deity of the locality must have a festival during this period 1384 

Snapana, giving an ablution to the Deity, forms an important part of the contents of the Āgamas It is of various kinds. Generally, it is given to the dhruvabera on a parucular day in a week and to the utsavabera on fixed occasions like Ekadasi. Amāvāsyā and Sravana and others. A special ball is required for the purpose. Small pitchers (kalasa) are to be made out of certain metals and materials and of prescribed dimensions. Certain kinds of precious stones and of grains are to be procured and put there. The number of pitchers varies according to the

The particular spots, directions and method according to which they are to be placed, are detailed in many of the texts, 1386 For offering the bath, apart from pure water, pañcagavya, curds, milk, honey, and other Ilquds are required, and they are to be filled in pitchers kept in specified places Different mantras are given to sanctify the various substances mentioned above. These pitchers are to be honoured with arghya, pādya, ācamaniye, dhūpa, dipa, naivedya, ärätrika and other upacāras. Then, as per the prescribed method in the texts, the acārya must perform snapana to the delty to the chanting of the mantras enjoined to be used. There are to be short latervals between the use of a certain number of pitchers containing certain ingredients. During those intervals, the Delty must be offered some upācāres Including naivedya. The Agama texts refer to other kinds of snapana. Mahābhiseka is the name given to snapana conducted on an elaborate scale.1387 Worldly prosperity and the like are stated to accrue to those who undertake to conduct snapana of these kinds 1388

The person who receives It, must take it without allowing even a drop to remain in the palm.1391 Those who take it must not wash their hands also, as it would then mean that the palm has become polluted through its touch with the lips The holy water can never become unboly. On the other hand, it purifies the lips and through them the entire body and the self there. The palm therefore becomes and remains pure. 

The present-day custom of offering the holy water at first in the temple every day when the puja or snapana is done, to certain persons who are Acārya purusas and who have their rights to receive it so, without the priest partaking it, has no sanction in the Agamas.

and other items concerned with the temple. Hence the Agama texts have enjoined and expounded the rites of expiation in detail These acts are all the more necessary, because the people visit temples and worship God there Defects of commission and omission detract from the sanctified presence of God in the idols there. So much so, people who attend the temple cannot get the benefit for the r worship Hence the Agamas (the Vaikhānasa ir particular) contain many chapters on expiation (pray asciita) 1393 

A very important kind of explatory rite is not'cd in the Paramesvara and Pādma Samhitas It is called Tularohana. For the lapses comautted by the ruling king he is to be weigned in a balance against gold The pieces of gold should be distributed among the deserving 1394 

The practice of weighing a person against gold or silver or any other object may be anterior to the period when these samhitas came to include it as part of expiatory rites. This pracuce has been continuing even to the present day in some form or other, but act necessarily as per of expiation for the shortcomings in the conduct of temple worship 

Among these rituals, the Pavitra is the most important and Is held to be of paramount significance in making amends for the lapses, derelictions and imperfections in the worship 

1393 

The earlier Pañcarātra texts have one chapter for expiation, but do not refer to any defect from the Vaikhānasa practices Vide -JS XXV, PauS XLIII, SKS Rs1-VIII Later texts prohibit the admixture of the two Agama traditions and also that of the Siddhantas of the Pañcarātra, Vide -PaS IV 18 & 19, Pār$ XIX, XXI & XXII IS, XIX, KapiñjalaS
