## Aindra decline
Apart from the Bharhut and Sanchi Stupas (in which Indra is invariably depicted with ambiguous features and as subservient to Buddha rather than as an object of veneration), depictions of Indra are very sparse until almost five centuries after the time of Porus.

### vyAkaraNa
According to Dāṇḍekar, the rule "Vāsudevārjunābhyāṃ vun" implies that the Vāsudeva-cult had largely come to supercede the "Aindra" Arjuna-cult (abhyarhitaṃ ca pūrvaṃ nipatati, "that which is [more] honoured in placed first") at the time of Pāṇini, who lived in the Northwest (Śālātura) around the 4th or 5th century BC.

Bhāgavatism is almost certainly older than Buddhism, as evidenced by the Ghaṭajātaka and the arguments against Śāśvatavāda in the Brahmajālasutta. It is possibly older Jainism as well, though that is up for debate.

> Just a correction that (present Pali) JATAKAS in story format are commentaries they don't go back to even 5th century. As for Vasudeva and Baladeva there is a mention in Cullaniddessa.

I'm not referring to mention of Vāsudeva, but rather to the narrative itself.
In the narrative, Vāsudeva is presented as a king which historians have noted is a secondary or even tertiary  development from the earlier narrative in which Ugrasena is king.

The Vepacittisutta was also composed in response to an early version of the Gītā (the "triṣṭubh" hymn), with Mātali representing Kṛṣṇa and Indra representing Arjuna.

All of this has been discussed at length by scholars.

## vedic identification
Moreover, the mention of Vāsudeva and Saṅkarṣaṇa alongside Vedic deities and rituals (in the Nāṇeghāṭ inscription) and the identification of Vāsudeva and Saṅkarṣaṇa with the Vedic deity Nārāyaṇa (in the Hāthībāḍā Ghosuṇḍī inscription from Rajasthan) indicates that Bhāgavatism had largely merged with Vedic Vaiṣṇavism by at least the 2nd century BC. 

## Pre shaiva
Aside from a few notable exceptions (e.g. the Śivaliṅga at Guḍimallam, which bears a depiction of Śiva atop Apasmara) the vast majority of devotional depictions from the time period are associated either with either Yakṣa-cult or with Bhāgavatism/Vaiṣṇavism. Even Buddhism was largely aniconic until a few centuries later.

## Heracles
The Greek accounts of authors like Arian and Megasthenes also speak of Heracles being adored by the Sourasenoi on the Iobares/Yamuna in the cities of Kleisobora and Methora (i.e. Mathurā).

Given Megasthenes' statement connecting "Heracles" with the "Sourasenoi" (Śūrasenas) and "Methora" (Mathurā) as well as the statement from Strabo indicating that "Heracles" was worshipped primarily in the plains while "Dionysus" (likely Śiva) was worshipped in the mountains, the most likely scenario is that the "Heracles," whose figure was carried by Porus' army, was actually Vāsudeva.
