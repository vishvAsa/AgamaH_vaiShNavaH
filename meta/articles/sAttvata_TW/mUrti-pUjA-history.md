Temple worship in India also may have its origins in Bhāgavatism.

The famous Heliodorus pillar of Vidiśā/Besnagar was part of a temple complex in honor of Vāsudeva dating to the 3rd century BC, around the same time as the Śivaliṅga from Gudimallam temple.

The earliest anthropomorphic images of Indian cult/votive deities in India comes from Bhāgavatism (Tikula, coins of Agathocles, Malhar), Śaivism (Gudimallam Liṅga), and Yakṣa-cult (Parkham Maṇibhadra). These figures date to the 3rd - 2nd century BC.

## patanjali
Moreover, Patañjali (living in 1st century BC) speaks of the existence of a prāsāda (i.e. temple) dedicated to the worship of Dhanapati (i.e. Kubera/Vaiśravaṇa) Rāma (i.e. Baladeva/Saṅkarṣaṇa) and Keśava (i.e. Gopāla-Kṛṣṇa/Vāsudeva).

There is some debate as to whether the first section regarding the playing of drums, conches, and flutes in the assembly is connected to the second part about the temple dedicated to the three aforementioned deities. This is because the first part (mṛdaṅga-śaṅkha-tūṇavāḥ pṛthaṅ nadanti saṁsadi) follows the jarau lagau (i.e.।ऽ।ऽ।ऽ।ऽ) pattern of Pramāṇikā metre whereas the latter part (prāsāde Dhanapati-Rāma-Keśavānām) follows the manajaragāḥ pattern (i.e. ऽऽऽ।।।।ऽ।ऽ।ऽऽ) of Praharṣiṇī metre.

So although we can conclude that  a temple to those particular deities must have existed during Patañjali's era, it's not certain whether the use of those particular instruments accompanied temple worship during that period.

## Later codification
Although Pāñcarātrika temple worship was first codified in Gupta-era Kashmir, several of the practices described in the Pāñcarātra Āgamas/Saṁhitās may date to 3rd century BC.

## Jaina bauddha contrast
The earliest Jaina figure is Pārśvanātha from the Pārśvanātha Āyāgapaṭa, dating to the first century BC.

There is no anthropomorphic inage of Buddha before 1st century AD Mathurā & Gandhāra, which postdates even images of Skanda on Yaudheya coins.

The Sāñcī Stūpa and Barhut Stūpa depict Buddha in aniconic form and depict Indra/Śakra and Brahmā with nondescript characteristics, implying that a particular iconography had not yet developed.

## Cult epigraphy
On the other hand, there are rock-art petroglyphs ~3rd-2nd century BC depicting Vāsudeva  Saṅkarṣaṇa, and Ekānaṃśā/Nidrā-Kālarūpiṇī (Tikula, Madhya Pradesh), coins of Agathocles of Bactria ~ 180 BCE depicting Vāsudeva and Saṅkarṣaṇa (NW India), Śuṅga era depiction of Viṣṇu ~2nd century BC (Malhār, Chattīsgaṛh), etc.

There are numerous inscriptions attesting to the existence of Bhāgavatism and the worship of Vāsudeva and Saṅkarṣaṇa prior to the common era (e.g. the Hāthībādā-Ghosuṇḍī inscription from Rājasthān, the Besnagar Pillar of Heliodorus at Vidiśā, the Vasu Doorjamb inscription from Mathurā, Nāneghāṭ inscription from Mahārāṣṭra).

A depiction of the Vṛṣṇi triad was even discovered at Berenike, Egypt (~1st century AD), indicating that Bhāgavatism was somewhat popular among Indian merchant communities.

So there is considerable iconographic evidence in addition to epigraphic evidence from inscriptions such as Besnagar Pillar of Heliodorus (Vidiśā), Vasu Doorjamb inscription (Mathurā), Hāthībādā-Ghosuṇḍī (Rājasthān), Nāneghāṭ (Mahārāṣṭra), etc.


The Mora Well inscription referring to pratimās of the Vṛṣṇi Pañcavīras (i.e. Saṅkarṣaṇa/Balarāma, Vāsudeva/Kṛṣṇa, Pradyumna, Sāmba, and Aniruddha) and the Vasu Doorjamb inscription referencing a toraṇa that was erected at the great temple of Vāsudeva were discovered at Mathurā.

Megasthenes also references the cult of "Heracles" at "Methora" and "Kleisobora." 

## Coins
In terms of numismatic evidence (as opposed to epigraphic evidence), the coins of the Vṛṣṇi duo (Vāsudeva-Kṛṣṇa & Saṅkarṣaṇa-Balarāma) from Taxila can be more securely dated as they bear the name of the Greco-Bactrian ruler Agathocles, who ruled during the early 2nd century BC.
