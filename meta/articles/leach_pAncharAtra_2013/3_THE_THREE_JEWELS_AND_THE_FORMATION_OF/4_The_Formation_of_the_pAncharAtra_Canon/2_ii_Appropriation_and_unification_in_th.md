What can the classificatory innovations in such texts as the PādS and the PārS tell us about the Pāñcarātra traditions in South India? To what degree were these “canonical” 

schemes describing well-established exegetical principles and Pāñcarātrika identities, and to what degree were such systems modelled on the texts themselves? With regard to the four Siddhāntas the second question is very difficult to answer, though the Vaikhānasa literature, which contains various taxonomies of Pāñcarātra groups, may provide a clue that this system of classification did not long precede its earliest descriptions in the Pāñcarātra literature. For the earliest probable Vaikhānasa reference to the ‘Siddhānta’ system of classification occurs only in the *Ānandasaṃhitā*, which is among the latest of the Vaikhānasa “medieval corpus”.142 With regard to the organisation and classification of the Pāñcarātra scriptures, these processes are not yet evident in the earliest Pāñcarātra works, and the textual evidence suggests that they did not begin to gain importance until about the twelfth century, some time after Yāmuna’s composition of the ĀP.143 This is suggested by the fact that those works which classify and enumerate the Saṃhitās, such as the PādS and the PārS, do so as part of an overall attempt, that is absent in the earlier scriptures, to provide scriptural authority for a Pāñcarātra system of temple-worship.144 Although his *modus operandi* and his intended audience are clearly different, this is also one of Yāmuna’s main objectives in the ĀP. However, despite the fact that he names and quotes several Saṃhitās, Yāmuna does not refer to any scriptural system of text-classification, or to any “canonical” list, and this indicates that such strategies were indeed not yet “well-established” within the Pāñcarātra context. 

[^142]: See Colas \(1990: 27\), who reports that the *Ānandasaṃhitā* \(8.23-24\) describes the *siddhānta* of the *avāntaravaiṣṇavas *\(the Pāñcarātrikas\) as “fourfold”, though it does not name the subdivisions. 

[^143]: However, as we will see below, a work *external* to the Pāñcarātra scriptural corpus, namely the Śaiva *Śrīkaṇṭhī* or *Śrīkaṇṭhīyasaṃhitā*, contains what may be a pre-Yāmuna “canonical” list of Pāñcarātra Saṃhitās. 

[^144]: In other words, the cataloguing of scriptures constitutes an attempt to distinguish those works prescribing rites for temple-worship which have scriptural authority from those which do not. [[90]]

To reiterate, there was no single classificatory method employed by the Pāñcarātra Saṃhitas, and so any discussion of a Pāñcarātra “canon” needs to be prefaced with the caveat that what was “canonical” for one Pāñcarātra tradition, for instance the supremacy of the JS, SS and PauṣS, was, as we have seen above, not necessarily canonical for another.145 Here it is worth recalling Michael Witzel’s \(1997: 259-260\) remarks on the development of the *Vedic* canon: 

\[O\] *riginally there was no canon* of Vedic texts, no Vedic “Scripture”, but only a *canon of texts accepted by each school*… This means: *all school texts taken* *together form the Vedic canon*. It does not mean that *all* of these texts were accepted by *all Brahmins*. A working definition, thus, may be: the Vedic canon consists of the sum of all those texts in Vedic Sanskrit that originated in and were used by the various Vedic schools \( *śākhās*\). 

While it is highly probable that the fourfold ‘Siddhānta’ system of classification within the Pāñcarātra was a South Indian innovation which based itself upon the Vedic precedent, and which might be usefully interpreted therefore as presenting an *ideal* *model * rather than a purely descriptive account,146 it is nonetheless evident that there were real divisions among Pāñcarātrikas, that these divisions are likely to have preceeded the extant Pāñcarātra scriptural literature,147 and that, to paraphrase Witzel, not *all* Pāñcarātra scriptures were “originally” considered “canonical” by *all* Pāñcarātra groups. This is nowhere more evident than with regard to the “three jewels”. 

[^145]: It also needs to be emphasised, when speaking of traditions * within* the Pāñcarātra, that many of the texts at our disposal do not “belong” to one Siddhānta or another, but rather are composite entities which often appear to have undergone redactions, for example, by both Āgamasiddhāntins *and* Mantrasiddhāntins \(or their “Veda-congruent” equivalents\). An obvious example of this is the PauṣS, though the ĪS and the PādS also betray the influence of both Siddhāntas. 

[^146]: To characterise the Siddhānta system of classification as in some sense normative \(as opposed to 

“purely descriptive”\) is not to deny that Pāñcarātra groups may have been arranged according to this model during certain periods, at least in the eyes of some Pāñcarātrikas. The delineations of the four Siddhāntas found in both the PādS and the PārS are certainly presented as “descriptive” accounts, and for instance the PādS, PārS and BhT all prescribe reparation rites \( *prāyaścitta*\) for those who have 

“mixed” ritual practices from different Siddhāntas. Elsewhere in the PādS \( *kp* 24.6b\), meanwhile, one of the essential characteristics of the ideal *ācārya* is said to be *siddhāntabhedavid*. 

[^147]: As we have seen above, Rājānaka Ratnākara refers to distinct Pāñcarātra groups in his *Haravijaya*, written in c. 830 CE. Śaṅkara also appears to recognise distinctions among groups which perform worship at the “five times” and which venerate the four Vyūha forms of god. **[[91]]

As we have seen, three of the four Pāñcarātra scriptures which claim the superiority of the JS, SS and PauṣS also mention a “root-Veda” or an “original Veda” 

\( *mūlaveda*\) within the same context. In each instance, this “original Veda” designates the so-called ‘Ekāyanaveda’,148 thus linking these passages, and therefore we must assume the “three jewels doctrine” itself, with the Pāñcarātra tradition that is referred to in the PādS and the PārS as the ‘Āgamasiddhānta’.149 As outlined above, the Āgamasiddhānta is variously characterised in the PādS by its allegiance to the Ekāyanaveda, by having liberation as its single goal, by prescribing its “leading rite” 

\( *nayakarma*\) for all four *varṇas*, by the fact that its members do not undergo *dīkṣā*, and by the fact that they do not use Vedic mantras and recite the *dvādaśākṣara* mantra without the Vedic elements *ṛṣi* and *chandas*. According to the ŚrīprśS \(16.31c-34\), the Āgamasiddhānta shares these last characteristics with both the Tantra and the Tantrāntara Siddhāntas, and it is exclusively members of the *Mantrasiddhānta* who are qualified to use Vedic mantras alongside those belonging to the ‘Ekāyana’. The PādS’s claim that the Āgamasiddhānta does not teach the *ṛṣi* and * chandas* elements of a mantra appears to be corroborated by both the PārS and the ĪS, neither of which teach these \(Rastelli 2006: 208-209\). In the absence of any conflicting evidence, then, this characteristic alone should make it relatively easy to distinguish textual sources belonging to the Āgamasiddhānta from those which belong to the Mantrasiddhānta, at least when we are considering those works which contain these classifications. 

The type of Pāñcarātrika who adheres to the Mantrasiddhānta is commonly referred to as a “mixed worshipper” \( *vyāmiśrayājin*\) by Āgamasiddhāntin or 148 See especially PārS 1.32c-33b: *ity uktvādhyāpayām āsa vedam ekāyanābhidam *// *mūlabhūtas tu* *mahato vedavṛkṣasya yo mahān */. – “Having spoken thus, he taught the Veda called Ekāyana, which is the main root of the great Veda-tree”; ĪS 1.19-20b \(← PārS 1.57c-58b, 1.33ab\); ĪS 1.24ab \(← PārS 

1.76ab\): *mahato vedavṛkṣasya mūlabhūto mahān ayam */. – “This \[Ekāyanaveda\] is the main root of the great Veda-tree”; ŚrīprśS 2.38ab: *vedam ekāyanam nāma vedānāṃ śirasi sthitam */. – “The Veda named Ekāyana is situated at the head of the Vedas”. 

[^149]: I have referred to the claim that the SS, PauṣS and JS are the superior Pāñcarātra scriptures as the 

“three jewels doctrine” for ease of exposition, though it should not obscure the fact that these texts are not referred to as the “three jewels” in any extant Āgamasiddhānta source. [[92]]

‘Ekāyana’ authors who consider such worshippers to be inferior.150 An example of this can be found in the PauṣS: 

*viprā ekāyanākhyā ye te bhaktās tattvato ’cyute *// *ekāntinaḥ sutattvasthā dehāntān* *nānyayājinaḥ */ *kartavyatvena ye viṣṇuṃ saṃyajanti phalaṃ vinā *// *prāpnuvanti* *ca dehānte vāsudevatvam abjaja */ *vyāmiśrayājinaś cānye bhaktābhāsās tu te* *smṛtāḥ *//. – “Those Brahmins that are called Ekāyanas are truly devotees of Acyuta. They who worship Viṣṇu as a duty \[that is\] without fruit, worshipping no other \[god\], are Ekāntins \(“they have a single aim”\) who \[will\] exist in their true state after death. \[In other words\] at death they attain the state of Vāsudeva, O 

Lotus-born\! And the others are mixed sacrificers - they are considered to be devotees in appearance only.” \(PauṣS 36.260c-262\) 

The division between those Vaiṣṇavas who “mix” a Pāñcarātrika system of image worship with elements taken from the Vedic liturgy, and those who typically 

“reject” or who are not “qualified for” the use of Vedic mantras and the institution of *varṇa*-based rules, appears to have been the most significant schism within the South Indian Pāñcarātra in the early centuries of the second millennium. The *Bhārgavatantra* \(BhT 24.17-18\) characterises these groups as, respectively, the “mixed” \( *miśra*\) and the “pure” \( *śuddha*\) Vaiṣṇavas.151 Representatives of these two Pāñcarātra traditions are contrasted with each other already in Yāmuna’s *Āgamaprāmāṇya* \(ĀP\) \(169-171\) and, as we have seen above, both traditions produced scriptural works which glorify their own tradition and undermine the other. Conversely, no extant work, as far as I am aware, identifies itself with the Tantra or Tantrāntara Siddhāntas.152 To the extent that these appear to have been the two most prominent types of Pāñcarātrika in South India during the 12th-14th centuries, the descriptions of the ‘Āgamasiddhānta’ and the 

‘Mantrasiddhānta’ contained in such texts as the PādS and the PārS appear to offer 150 The designation “mixed worshipper” \( *vyāmiśrayājin*\) does not only refer to worshippers who perform both Pāñcarātrika and Vedic rites. In the PārS, for instance, it is used more generally to denote *all* followers of the “mixed dharma” \( *miśradharma*\), which is the PārS’s name for the Vedas. 

[^151]: The “mixed” Vaiṣṇavas, who are described as *traividya*, are here associated with the *aṣṭākṣara* mantra, and the “pure” Vaiṣṇavas, who follow the Ekāyanaveda, with the *dvādaśākṣara * mantra. Colas \(1990: 26\) reports that the Vaikhānasa work *Kriyādhikāra* also divides the Pāñcarātra into *miśra* and *śuddha* sub-groups and that, according to the *Yajñādhikāra*, the latter has no *vedamaryādā*. 

[^152]: However, according to Vedāntadeśika \(PRR 30.18 *ff*\) the *Śrīkarasaṃhitā* associates *itself* with the 

‘Purāṇasiddhānta’. The PRR \(31.1-2\) quotes this text thus: *etat purāṇasiddhāntaṃ śrīkaraṃ ca viśeṣataḥ*

/ *idaṃ śrīkarasaṃjñākhyaṃ bhogamokṣaphalapradam *//. Vedāntadeśika \(PRR 30.21-22 and 31.5-6\) asserts that the name ‘Purāṇasiddhānta’ designates the ‘Tantrāntarasiddhānta’, and argues that it is precisely the Tantrāntarasiddhānta that is denoted by the particle *ca* in the above verse. [[93]]

something of a valuable, albeit inevitably incomplete, Pāñcarātrika ethnography of this period. 

It is notable that of the eight Pāñcarātra scriptures that contain, or are said to contain, a hierarchical description of the Siddhānta divisions, five of these place the Āgamasiddhānta at the top. These are the PauṣS, the PārS, the ĪS and, according to Vedāntadeśika, the HP and the *Kālottara*.153 Only the PādS, the BhT \(whose account is clearly based on that of the PādS\),154 and the later ŚrīprśS give the highest status to the Mantrasiddhānta.155 If we are to assume, as we surely must, that the fourfold Siddhānta system of classification developed within \(or, in the other possible scenario, was first adopted by\) *one particular* Pāñcarātra tradition \(i.e. as opposed to the improbable scenario that it simultaneously emerged among distinct traditions\), it would seem quite likely, then, that this particular tradition was that which identified itself, at least in certain works, as precisely the ‘Āgamasiddhānta’. This thesis, which is speculative, also appears to find support in the probable status of the PauṣS as the work which contains the earliest extant description of the Siddhānta divisions. For the passage in question \(i.e. PauṣS 38.293-307b\) gives precedence to the Āgama “called Siddhānta” 

\( *siddhāntasaṃjñam*, 294c\), which it lists alongside the Mantra, Tantra and Tantrāntara Siddhāntas. These verses were presumably authored by a member of the tradition which is elsewhere called ‘Āgamasiddhānta’. In addition, as we shall see in a later 153 The verses attributed to the HP or, as Vedāntadeśika names it, the ‘ *Hayagrīvasaṃhitā*’ in the PRR 

\(8.5-8\) read: *āgamākhyaṃ hi siddhāntaṃ sanmokṣaikaphalapradam */ *mantrasaṃjñaṃ hi siddhāntaṃ*

*siddhimokṣapradaṃ nṛṇām *// *tantrasaṃjñaṃ tu siddhāntaṃ caturvargaphalapradam */ *tantrāntaraṃ*

*hi siddhāntaṃ vāñchitārthaphalapradam *//. – “The Siddhānta named Āgama grants liberation as its only fruit. The Siddhānta called Mantra grants to people liberation and magical powers \( *siddhi*\). The Siddhānta called Tantra grants the “group of four” \(i.e. the *puruṣārtha* s\) as its fruit. The Tantrāntara Siddhānta grants as its fruit the “desired goal”.” Vedāntadeśika \(PRR 8.9\) explains that the “desired goal” here indicates liberation \( *apavarga*\). The verses attributed to the *Kālottara* in the PRR \(31.14-18\) read: *anekabhedabhinnaṃ ca pañcarātrākhyam āgamam */ *pūrvam āgamasiddhāntaṃ mantrākhyaṃ*

*tadanantaram *// *tantraṃ tantrāntaraṃ ceti caturdhā parikīrtitam *//. – “The tradition named Pañcarātra is split into various divisions \( *bheda*\). The first is the Āgama, and after that there is the one called Mantra, the Tantra, and the Tantrāntara. Thus it is said to be fourfold.” 

[^154]: See BhT 22.87-93b, and BhT 24.19-20 \(← PādS *cp* 21.36, 37cd, 38ab\), BhT 24.25-27b \(← PādS *cp* 21.53-54b, 38c-39b\). 

[^155]: See e.g. ŚrīprśS 16.32-34b: *tantrāntare tv āgame ca siddhānte tantrasaṃjñike */ *teṣu* *pūjāpravṛttānāṃ dīkṣā nirbījasaṃjñikā *// *anyeṣāṃ dīkṣākaraṇe teṣām anadhikāritā */ *ato nirbīja ity* *uktā vidvadbhiḥ kamalekṣaṇe *// *sabījaṃ mantrasiddhāntadīkṣākramam udīryate */. – “For those engaged in worship according to the Tantrāntara, the Āgama and the Siddhānta called Tantra, the initiation is called ‘without seed’. For them there is no entitlement to perform the intiation of others. 

Thus it is called ‘without seed’ by the learned, O lotus-eyed. \[Conversely\] the method of initiation in the Mantrasiddhānta is called ‘with seed’.” [[94]]

chapter, it is the classification found in Āgamasiddhānta sources which is accepted as 

“canonical” by Vedāntadeśika in his PRR. Irrespective of its origin, we can be certain, at any rate, that the Siddhānta system of classification was adopted fairly quickly by at least some Pāñcarātrikas who also performed Vedic rites, as is proven by its presence in the PādS. 

The textual evidence suggests that a similar process occurred with regard to the 

“three jewels”, though it appears to have taken considerably longer for this theory to have gained acceptance among the non-Āgamasiddhāntin Pāñcarātrikas. As stated above, three of the four extant works which contain a passage claiming the superiority of the JS, SS and PauṣS refer in the same instance to the ‘Ekāyanaveda’, thus linking these passages to the Āgamasiddhānta. However, whilst the PārS and the majority of the ĪS are undoubtedly authored by Āgamasiddhāntins, the third work which associates the “three jewels doctrine” with the ‘Ekāyanaveda’, namely the ŚrīprśS, is almost certainly primarily a work of the ‘Mantrasiddhānta’. This is evident not only from the fact that substantial portions of this text borrow from or are based upon the PādS, as Padmanabhan \(1969\) has shown, but also from its frequent use of Vedic mantras156 allied to its claim that among the four Siddhāntas it is only members of the Mantrasiddhānta who are entitled to use Vedic mantras alongside those belonging to the ‘Ekāyana’ \(the term ‘Ekāyana’ being used here to refer to the Pāñcarātra in general\).157 How, then, are we to interpret the inclusion of these ‘Ekāyana’ passages in the ŚrīprśS? It is worth our while to briefly address each of these. 

In several places in the ŚrīprśS \(e.g. at 2.38 *ff*, 16.20 and 16.34\), the terms 

‘Ekāyana’ and ‘Ekāyanaveda’ are used to refer to the Pāñcarātra tradition and the Pāñcarātra teaching in general.158 On each of these occasions, the Vedas are referred to in the same verse - once in order to accord the Ekāyanaveda the higher authority \(2.38ab: *vedam ekāyanaṃ nāma vedānāṃ śirasi sthitam*\), and in the other two 156 These are listed by Padmanabhan \(1969\) in the appendix to the ŚrīprśS. 

[^157]: ŚrīprśS 16.34: *sabījaṃ mantrasiddhāntadīkṣākramam udīryate */ *caturvedoktamantraiś ca mantrair* *ekāyanasthitaiḥ *//. – “\[Conversely\] the method of initiation in the Mantrasiddhānta is called ‘with seed’. \[It is performed\] with mantras enunciated in the four Vedas and with mantras contained in the Ekāyana.” ****

[^158]: The “Veda named Ekāyana” is also mentioned at ŚrīprśS 23.185a, though in this instance its precise referent is not clear. [[95]]

instances to place the Ekāyanaveda and the Vedas on an equal footing. In each of these examples, the idea of the ‘Ekāyanaveda’ appears to be employed as a means of establishing the authority of the Pāñcarātra tradition, but only in the first instance \(i.e. 

at ŚrīprśS 2.38ab\) does the representation of the Ekāyanaveda conform to the characteristically Ekāyana view, which we have seen articulated in the PārS and the ĪS, that the Ekāyanaveda is *superior* to the Vedas. Such a claim is unlikely to have been authored by the more Veda-congruent Pāñcarātrikas, at least according to the representation of these groups that we find in the PādS.159 In light of this, I propose that ŚrīprśS 2.38ab, along with a number of other verses in the section 2.26-46b, have been borrowed by a Mantrasiddhāntin author from an Āgamasiddhānta source. This hypothesis is preferable to one which would have the whole passage borrowed from, or re-worked by, an Āgamasiddhāntin author or editor, since the description of the Pāñcarātra “duties” \( *kārya*\) at 2.43-46b includes initiation \( *dīkṣā*\) \(45a\) which, as we have seen, was *not* undergone in the Āgamasiddhānta according to a variety of sources. In addition to 2.38ab, I propose that the reference to the Ekāyanaveda as a *nivṛttiśāstra* at 2.32a, and the contrasting description at 2.26d of the three Vedas as advancing a path of ritual action \( *karmapravartinī*\) have also been borrowed from an Āgamasiddhānta source, since such terminology is key to Āgamasiddhāntin self-understanding in the PārS, and is quite distinct from the language used in “outsider” 

descriptions of the Ekāyana found, for example, in the PādS, from which the ŚrīprśS 

borrows quite freely, and also the BhT.160 Other apparent borrowings from Āgamasiddhānta sources include the *nirukti* analysis of the name ‘Ekāyana’ at 2.39 

\(cf. PārS 1.57c-58b and ĪS 1.19\), and the claim at 2.41c that the Pāñcarātra *śāstra * is 

“eternal, like the Veda” \( *vedavan nityam*\). 

[^159]: See especially the Mantrasiddhāntin author’s description of the Āgamasiddhānta at PādS *cp* 21.30-54b. 

[^160]: On the use of this terminology in the PārS see Rastelli \(2006: 163-166\). Rastelli shows that the PārS 

borrows these terms from the *Nārāyaṇīya*, but modifies their meaning so that “*pravṛtti * ist eine \(rituelle\) Tätigkeit mit dem Zweck, die Erfüllung von Wünschen zu erlagen \[und\] *nivṛtti * ist eine \(rituelle\) Tätigkeit, die ohne jegliches Begehren durchgeführt wird…” \(ibid: 166\). Following the *Nārāyaṇīya*, PārS 1.45c *ff* associates *pravṛtti * with the Vedas, and *nivṛtti * with its own teaching \(which is, for the PārS, the Ekāyanaveda\). The PādS \( *cp* 19.117a, 21.35c\), meanwhile, describes the “renunciation of action” 

\( *karmasaṃnyāsa*\) and the “desireless” \( *nirāśa*\) worship of god in the Āgamasiddhānta, but it does not favourably contrast these practices with those employed by followers of the Veda. See also BhT 24.19-27b. [[96]]

In the 16th chapter of the ŚrīprśS, the term ‘Ekāyanaveda’ is used to refer to the Pāñcarātra teaching in general. The verse in question reads as follows: *yathaiva karmakāṇḍeṣu dīkṣoktā yāgasiddhaye */ *tathaivaikāyane vede* *pūjāyāgādisiddhaye *//. - “Just as initiation \( *dīkṣā*\) is spoken of \[as necessary\] for the performance of sacrifice in the ritual portions \( *karmakāṇḍa*\) \[of the Veda\], so too \[it is spoken of as necessary\] for the performance of worship and sacrifice etc. in the Ekāyanaveda.” \(ŚrīprśS 16.20\) 

This verse, then, provides another instance \(i.e. alongside ŚrīprśS 2.26-46b\) in which an association is drawn between followers of the ‘Ekāyanaveda’ and *dīkṣā*. As we have seen above, earlier works such as the PādS and the PārS indicate, contrarily, that followers of the Ekāyanaveda do *not* undergo *dīkṣā*. Of course, the passages from these works which address this issue, such as PādS *cp* 21.51-53 which explicitly states that “the way of the Ekāyana” \( *ekāyanādhvan*\) does not involve *dīkṣā*, do not use the designation ‘Ekāyana’ as a name for the Pāñcarātra in general, as is the case in the 16th chapter of the ŚrīprśS. As I have stated earlier, the above verse \(ŚrīprśS 16.20\) occurs in a passage which identifies the ŚrīprśS with the Mantrasiddhānta, and so this is quite a clear example, therefore, of a Mantrasiddhāntin incorporating the idea of the 

‘Ekāyanaveda’ into his own tradition’s self-understanding. The same process also appears to be at work at ŚrīprśS 49.471c-473, quoted above, which incorporates the presumably Āgamasiddhāntin claim regarding the superiority of the JS, SS and PauṣS. 

Although we cannot be sure of the “sectarian” identity of the author of this passage, it is quite clear that these verses are borrowed from an Āgamasiddhānta source. This is evident not only from the fact that, as mentioned previously, they strongly echo PārS 

1.77 and ĪS 1.25, but also from the fact that the section of the ŚrīprśS in which they are found is replete with borrowings from Āgamasiddhānta sources.161 

[^161]: See for example: ŚrīprśS 49.446cd ↔ ĪS 19.103ab; ŚrīprśS 49.448cd ↔ ĪS 19.93ab; ŚrīprśS 

49.454abc ↔ ĪS 19.100c-101a; ŚrīprśS 49.457a ↔ ĪS 19.104c; ŚrīprśS 49.464-466a ↔ PārS 19.496-498a → ĪS 19.117c-119c; ŚrīprśS 49.475-476b ↔ PārS 15.928c-929 → ĪS 19.67-68b; ŚrīprśS 49.476c-479b ↔ PārS 19.545-547 → ĪS 21.582c-584; ŚrīprśS 49.481-483b ↔ PārS 10.329-331b → ĪS 23.45c-47; ŚrīprśS 49.486abc ↔ ĪS 19.121abc; ŚrīprśS 49.487a ↔ ĪS 19.123a. It is possible, of course, that the ŚrīprśS borrowed these verses from another work. It should also be noted that close variants of PārS 

19.545-548b and 10.329-333b are quoted by Vedāntadeśika in his PRR \(18.15 *ff*; 40.8 *ff*\). [[97]]

Why should the ŚrīprśS, a work which seems to have been authored by Mantrasiddhāntins, incorporate these passages extolling the Ekāyanaveda? It appears that by the time of the composition of this work, the Ekāyanaveda, or at least the *idea* of the Ekāyanaveda had, in certain contexts, acquired an authoritative status among the more Veda-congruent Pāñcarātrikas. In Yāmuna’s ĀP, of course, we have already encountered an instance of a non-Āgamasiddhāntin \(i.e. Yāmuna himself\) accepting the validity of the Ekāyanaveda \(or the ‘Ekāyanaśruti’\), and it should be noted that Vedāntadeśika, whose PRR may well predate the ŚrīprśS, followed Yāmuna in this respect.162 Turning to the scriptural literature, this pattern is also evident in a section of the PādS which addresses the various *pañcakāla* observances incumbent upon the Pāñcarātrika initiate. In the passage \(PādS *cp* 13.66c-72b\) which deals with the study of texts \( *svādhyāya*\), the initiate is instructed to study, alongside the various recensions of the three Vedas, the “original recension based on the Ekāyana” 

\( *mūlaśākhām ekāyanasamāśrayām*\). Although, again, the “sectarian” identity of the author of this passage is not absolutely clear,163 his allegiance to the three Vedas and the respectful reference, for example, to “experts in the six limbs \[of the Veda\]” most probably indicates a non-Āgamasiddhānta background.164 Certainly the remainder of this chapter exhibits the kind of Veda-congruent Vaiṣṇava devotionalism which is more representative of the Mantrasiddhānta.165 

That the PādS should contain a passage wherein an apparently non-Āgamasiddhāntin author invokes the Ekāyanaveda might appear somewhat surprising given that in this work’s descriptions of the Pāñcarātra Siddhāntas \(see especially PādS *cp* 21.30-54b\), the Ekāyanaveda is explicitly associated *only* with the 162 See, for example, PRR 4.5-18 \(← ĀP 169.7-170.11\). The ŚrīprśS is not quoted by Vedāntadeśika, and thus may well succeed him. 

[^163]: There are passages in the PādS which do appear to have been authored by Āgamasiddhāntins, most notably in the first chapter of the Caryāpāda. 

[^164]: See PādS *cp* 13.67-70b: *ṛco yajūṃṣi sāmāni bhidyamānāny anekadhā *// *śākhābhedair mūlaśākhām* *ekāyanasamāśrayām */ *trayīmayīm adhīyīta sukhāsīnas samāhitaḥ *// *anyais sārdham adhīyānaiṣ*

[^165]: See especially the injunction to perform the Vaiśvadeva ritual at home following the recitation of the **

*Jitaṃtestotra*. This act completes the performance of the five “great sacrifices” \( *mahāyajña*\), which should be undertaken according to one’s Gṛhyasūtra. PādS * cp* 13.64 reads: *iti vijñāpya deveśaṃ*

*vaiśvadevaṃ svadhāmani */ *kuryāt pañca mahāyajñān api gṛhyoktavartmanā *//. On the *Jitaṃtestotra* see Colas \(1996: 234-236\) and Oberhammer \(2007: 42-46\). [[98]]

Āgamasiddhānta. We must assume that these two sections of the PādS do not share a common author, and that the summary of the *pañcakāla* duties in PādS *cp* 13 is in all likelihood the later contribution to the text. This is most likely the case because in the *scriptural* literature, the non-Āgamasiddhāntin incorporation of the idea of the Ekāyanaveda is a strategy which is found in the later works, including the ŚrīprśS, as we have just seen, and also the *Śrīpuruṣottamasaṃhitā* \(ŚrīpurS\), another work which probably postdates Vedāntadeśika \(Smith 1975: 274\). 

In the opening chapter of the ŚrīpurS, the sage Vasiṣṭha presents the designations 

‘Pāñcarātra’, ‘Mūlaveda’, ‘Sāttvata’, ‘Tantra’, ‘Ekāyana’ and ‘Āgama’ as synonymous terms,166 and in explaining why each of these names is an appropriate designation for the Lord’s teaching \( *bhagavacchāstra*\), the author incorporates passages from both the PādS and the ĪS, including them alongside each other. In fact, much of the first chapter of the ŚrīpurS is an amalgam of verses borrowed from these two works.167 Indeed, I believe that we can interpret this section of the ŚrīpurS as a conscious attempt to accommodate forms of self-understanding found within the more Veda-congruent Pāñcarātra traditions, as represented in the PādS, with those found within the Ekāyana tradition, and articulated in the ĪS, so that both are included within a single, homogeneous Pāñcarātra “system” \( *tantram*\).168 Accordingly, as in the *Adhikaḥ*

*Pāṭhaḥ* to which I shall turn shortly, there is no mention of distinct Pāñcarātra Siddhāntas in this work. However, the two contrasting Pāñcarātrika modes of self-description sit rather uneasily alongside each other in the ŚrīpurS. Thus, the Ekāyana claim that “this is the main root of the great Veda tree - the Ṛc etc. are its trunk and 166 ŚrīpurS 1.11 *ff*. See also ŚrīpurS 22.57c-59b \(← PādS *cp* 2.87c-88, quoted above\): *sa eva sūris suhṛt* *sāttvataḥ pāñcarātravit *// *ekāntikas *\( *ekāṃtikas*\) * tanmayaś ca deśiko dīkṣito ’rcakaḥ */ *gurur* *bhāgavataś caiva pūjakas sādhako hariḥ *// *bhaṭṭārakādir ākhyābhir ākhyeyaḥ kamalāsana */.

Additionally, the first chapter of the ŚrīpurS shares a noteworthy parallel verse, explaining the meaning of the term “Pāñcarātra”, with the *Mārkaṇḍeyasaṃhitā* \(MārkS\): ŚrīpurS 1.6c-7b ↔ MārkS 1.22c-23b. The MārkS may be more or less contemporary with the ŚrīpurS, though there are several clues that it is the earlier of the two works.

branches”,169 is included beside the PādS’s declaration that “this Tantra, rooted in *śruti*, is an authority like the Kalpasūtras. There is no teaching superior to the Veda”.170 I shall comment more on these opposing strategies in my discussion of the 

“original teaching” in the following chapters. 

The only extant non-Āgamasiddhānta scriptural source that contains an original formulation of the “three jewels doctrine”, then, is the interpolated section of the JS 

entitled *Adhikaḥ Pāṭhaḥ*. This fourteenth century work follows the PādS in invoking the memory of the sage Aupagāyana, said here to be a student \( *adhīyāna*\) of the Kāṇvī 

*śākhā* \(JS *ap* 109ab\) and it also prescribes the mixing \( *vimiśrita*\) of Vedic and celestial \( *divya*\) i.e. Pāñcarātrika mantras \(JS *ap* 118\). Having declared that the Jayākhya is superior among the “three jewels” \( *ratneṣu triṣv api śreṣṭhaṃ jayākhyaṃ tantram* *ucyate*, JS *ap* 108ab\), Lord Varada \( *varadarāja*\), the narrator of this section, asserts: *jayākhyenātha pādmena tantreṇa sahitena vai *// *mūlavyākhyānarūpābhyāṃ*

*samarcayatu māṃ sadā */ *na tantrasaṅkaro doṣas tantrayor anayor iha *//. – 

“Thus, one should always worship me according to the Jayākhya \[Saṃhitā\] *along* *with* the Pādma Tantra \[i.e.\] according to both forms - the root \[text\] and the commentary. Here, with regard to both Tantras, the defect is in *not* mixing the Tantras.” \(JS *ap * 111c-112\) 

Thus, the apparently Mantrasiddhāntin author of the *Adhikaḥ Pāṭhaḥ* has found a way of incorporating the teaching of the “three jewels” whilst ensuring that the PādS, a work which belongs to the Mantrasiddhānta, is, *practically* speaking, as essential as those texts. Where the “mixing” of one Tantra with another is normally discouraged as a “defect” or a “fault” \( *doṣa*\), in this instance the defect is said to be that of following the JS without also following its “commentary”, the PādS. This case offers a good example, then, not to mention a more seamless process, of forming a single 

“Pāñcarātra canon”, of bringing together “canonical” systems from distinct Pāñcarātra traditions with the aim of subsuming them into a “single” tradition. This integrative strategy is a clear development from the Mantrasiddhāntin appropriation of the 169 ŚrīpurS 1.14: *mahato vedavṛkṣasya mūlabhūto mahān ayam */ *ṛgādyāḥ skandhabhūtās te* *śākhābhūtāś ca yoginaḥ *//. 

[^170]: ŚrīpurS 1.26c-27a: *śrutimūlam idaṃ tantraṃ pramāṇaṃ kalpasūtravat *// *vedāc chāstraṃ paraṃ*

*nāsti.. *. /. [[100]]

tradition of the Ekāyanaveda which we have met with in the ŚrīprśS. Indeed, unlike the *Adhikaḥ Pāṭhaḥ* and the ŚrīpurS, the ŚrīprśS contains no deliberate and sustained attempt to present the Pāñcarātra as a single, homogeneous system. Thus, for instance, in the same passage that incorporates the “three jewels claim”, the ŚrīprśS advises against “mixing” the Siddhāntas.171 The more fully developed integrative approach of the *Adhikaḥ Pāṭhaḥ* and the ŚrīpurS probably indicates that both of these works postdate the ŚrīprśS. 

The inclusion of a canonical list of Pāñcarātra scriptures, which is found at the end of the ŚrīpurS’s first chapter as well as in several other predominantly late works, including an interpolated section of the PādS, also derives from this same integrative strategy. In addition to the PādS, the South Indian Pāñcarātra works which contain lists of Saṃhitās in their *śāstrāvataraṇa* portions are the ŚrīpurS, the *Viśvāmitrasaṃhitā *\(ViśS\), the *Kapiñjalasaṃhitā*, the *Bhāradvājasaṃhitā*, the *Mārkaṇḍeyasaṃhitā *\(MārkS\), and the *Viṣṇutantra*. Each of these except for the *Viṣṇutantra* 172 claim that there are at least 108 Tantras or Saṃhitās,173 but among them only the ViśS actually names 108.174 In this text we are told that the extent of the Pañcarātra Tantras amounts to “a thousand million verses \( *grantha*\)”, though this measure is said to increase and shorten in accordance with the course of the cosmic ages \( *yuga*\).175 

Finally, I should mention a rather interesting list of Pāñcarātra Saṃhitās, which may be relatively early, and is quite distinct in its content from other lists. I refer to that found in the Śaiva *Śrīkaṇṭhī*, also known as the *Śrīkaṇṭhīyasaṃhitā*, a fragment of which was discovered by Alexis Sanderson in a manuscript of a Kashmirian ritual manual called the *Nityādisaṃgraha*. An unedited transcript of this fragment appears in the appendices of Hanneder \(1998\). The *Śrīkaṇṭhī*, which is quoted by Kṣemarāja \(c. 

[^171]: ŚrīprśS 49.479ab ↔ PārS 19.547cd → ĪS 21.584cd. 

[^172]: The *Viṣṇutantra*, a late, unpublished Pāñcarātra text, lists 141 scriptures according to Schrader \(1916: 5\), and 154 scriptures according to Parampurushdas and Shrutiprakashdas \(2002: 55\). 

[^173]: As Schrader \(1916\) has pointed out, the number 108 should be read as symbolic, reflecting as it does numerical conventions such as the enumeration of 108 Upaniṣads. 

[^174]: The * Kapiñjalasaṃhitā* \(1.14b-27\) names 100 titles; in a very similar list \(see Smith 1975\), the *Bhāradvājasaṃhitā* \(1.8b-22a\) names 103; the ŚrīpurS \(1.30-44a\) names 105; the MārkS \(1.43-59\) names 91. 

[^175]: ViśS 2.34: *eteṣāṃ granthasaṃkhyā ca śatakoṭipramāṇataḥ */ *yugakramavaśād vipra vṛddhiṃ*

1000-1050\), and was apparently known also to Abhinavagupta \(c. 975-1025\), tells us that the Pāñcarātra amounts to “a thousand million \[ *śloka* s\]”, that there are 116 

Saṃhitās in total, that they are spoken by Viṣṇu, and that they explicate the teaching of the five times \( *pañcakāla*\).176 It then names all 116 works \(verses 53c-69\). Among these, alongside familiar titles including the *Pauṣkarī*, *Jayā*, *Padmodbhavā*, *Paramā*, *Sātvatā*, *Sanatkaumārikā*, *Mārkaṇḍeyā*, and *Viṣvaksenā*, are a number of titles which do not feature in other lists of Pāñcarātra scriptures. Such an extensive list of Pāñcarātra scriptures appears to be unique in the North Indian literature. Although a list of Pāñcarātra works is found also in the relatively early, and apparently North Indian *Hayaśīrṣapañcarātra*,177 in this work, and in the virtually identical list is contained in the *Agnipurāṇa* \(39.2c-5\), only 25 original Pañcarātra Tantras are admitted.178 

There are, in my view, several features of the *Śrīkaṇṭhī*’s list which may cause us to doubt whether it is as old as other parts of this text. Firstly, as just mentioned, it is much more extensive than any other list to have emerged in a North Indian work. 

Secondly, the importance it assigns to the teaching of the “five times” in the Pāñcarātra is rare in Kashmirian works of this period. The early Pāñcarātra scriptures which appear to have been authored in Kashmir themselves do not assign an especially prominent place to this teaching \(see Rastelli 2000a\). Thirdly, the fact that the tradition is called here ‘Pāñcarātra’, rather than ‘Pañcarātra’, is also very unusual. 

Although in South Indian works ‘Pāñcarātra’ gradually became the standard name for the tradition, it is much more commonly referred to as ‘Pañcarātra’ in the earlier literature.179 Lastly, none of the recently discovered early Pāñcarātra works, namely the *Svāyambhuvapañcarātra*, the * Devāmṛtapañcarātra*, the *Mahālakṣmīsaṃhitā*, and the *Jayottaratantra*, are named in the list. If Sanderson \(2009\) is correct in his 176 *Śrīkaṇṭhī* 51c-52: *śatakoṭipravistīrṇaṃ pāñcarātraṃ pramāṇataḥ *// *tatra bhedaśataṃ pūrṇaṃ*

*ṣoḍaśādhikam eva ca */ *viṣṇunā kathitaṃ devi pañcakālanidarśanam *//.

judgement that these works were composed in or around Kashmir before the middle of the tenth century, then we would surely expect their inclusion.
