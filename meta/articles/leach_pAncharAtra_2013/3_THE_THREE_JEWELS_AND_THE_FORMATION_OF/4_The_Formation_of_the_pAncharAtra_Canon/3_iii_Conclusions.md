The canonical list of scriptures contained in the PārS is probably one of the earliest attempts in a South Indian Saṃhitā to enumerate and classify the Pāñcarātra scriptural corpus. It is directly based on the hierarchy of teachings found in the SS, and the fact that it grades specific scriptures according to this hierarchy suggests that it is not derived from another canonical list. It is almost certainly older than the lists of Saṃhitās contained in other South Indian texts such as the PādS and the ViśS. 

Compared to these later lists, the PārS’s list is very short, and the hierarchical scheme it employs has the effect of limiting the canon to only a handful of genuinely authoritative works. The tradition of the supremacy of the JS, SS and PauṣS very likely emerged within the Pāñcarātra tradition to which the authors of the PārS 

belonged, namely the Āgamasiddhānta. We know that these authors had the JS, SS 

and PauṣS in their possession, since they incorporated a good deal of material from all three works into the PārS. The fact that they present these three scriptures as being unique in their ability to confer *mokṣa* may indicate that these works were not, at that time, in the possession of the Āgamasiddhāntins’ main Pāñcarātrika rivals. There is, as we have seen, no reason to believe that the authors of the PādS, for example, considered these works to be particularly important. Nonetheless, the idea of the supremacy of the JS, SS and PauṣS did later find its way into non-Āgamasiddhānta scriptures, as did also the idea of the Ekāyanaveda. 

In the context of the ĀP I argued that Yāmuna’s acceptance of the validity and authority of the Ekāyanaveda may have been motivated by the prominence of Āgamasiddhāntins at the Raṅganāthasvāmin temple in Śrīraṅgam, where Yāmuna was an *ācārya*. Can we advance similar explanations for the non-Āgamasiddhāntin acceptance of the Ekāyanaveda in such texts as the 13th chapter of the PādS’s 103 

Caryāpāda and the ŚrīprśS? In other words, were these works also produced in environments in which the Āgamasiddhāntins or Ekāyanas continued to exert a significant influence? This is a difficult question to answer at the present state of research, since the date and provenance of these texts is not clear.180 The relatively small literary output of the Āgamasiddhānta suggests that they were not numerically dominant, and the available evidence, as we have seen, suggests that they congregated in the relatively small Vaiṣṇava temple towns of Śrīraṅgam and Melkote. Nonetheless, we may provisionally assume that Āgamasiddhāntin influence within the Pāñcarātra extended beyond these places. I will come back to the question of why the more Veda-congruent Pāñcarātra works began incorporating apparently Āgamasiddhāntin ideas in Chapters Eight and Nine, once I have explored these separate traditions in greater depth. For the time being, a preliminary and partial explanation might usefully focus on the fact that it seems to have been the Āgamasiddhāntins who were initially responsible for the formation and classification of the Pāñcarātra canon. 

The climate of intra-Pāñcarātrika sectarianism attested to in such works as the PādS and the PārS appears, then, to have subsided, and been replaced by a culture wherein the more Veda-congruent Pāñcarātrikas, as represented by such works as the PādS, the ŚrīpurS and the *Adhikaḥ Pāṭhaḥ*, attempted to present a unified Pāñcārātra tradition. This is most clearly demonstrated in the extensive, non-hierarchical lists of Pāñcarātra scriptures referred to above. The attempt to integrate distinct Pāñcarātra traditions is observable already in Yāmuna’s ĀP, but in the scriptural literature it is only in evidence at a later time, most probably subsequent to the composition of the PārS. The passages I have addressed in the ŚrīprśS appear to indicate that the non-Āgamasiddhānta appropriation of the idea of the Ekāyanaveda, and of the supremacy of the JS, SS and PauṣS, had already begun before the appearance, among the scriptural works, of conscious attempts, such as we find in the ŚrīpurS, to present a single, homogeneous Pāñcarātra system. Indeed, it may well be the case that by the time of the composition of the ŚrīpurS, the sectarian culture had already dissipated, 180 The ŚrīprśS’s likely chronological position between the ĪS and texts such as the ŚrīpurS and the *Adhikaḥ Pāṭhaḥ* would place it most likely in the fourteenth century. Several commentators have linked the origin of the ŚrīprśS with Kumbakonam in present day Tamil Nadu, though this remains somewhat speculative \(Raghavan 1969\).

and that the “ecumenism” of this work reflected a new reality. It is certainly striking, as we will see in the following chapters, that the vast majority of the later Pāñcarātra Saṃhitās belong to the more Veda-congruent Pāñcarātra culture that is typified by the PādS, whereas the tradition that is represented in the PārS survives only in that work, in the ĪS, and in several apparently interpolated sections of earlier texts.
