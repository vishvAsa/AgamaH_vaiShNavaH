title = "1 i \\) Classifications of scripture in the Pārameśvarasaṃhitā and the Pādmasaṃhitā"

+++


In this chapter I address the textual evidence which points to the formation of the Pāñcarātra canon as being the outcome of the decline of the sectarian culture I have referred to above. In this first part, I compare the *Pārameśvarasaṃhitā*’s \(PārS\) relatively early attempt to establish a scriptural canon with the substantially different approach to canon-formation that is found in the PādS. 

## Statements
As we have seen in Chapter One, both the PārS and the *Īśvarasaṃhitā *\(ĪS\) employ a classificatory scheme in which the Pāñcarātra scriptures are divided into three groups, namely the celestial teachings \( *divyaśāstra*\), the teachings of sages \( *munibhāṣitaśāstra*\), and the teachings of men \( *pauruṣaśāstra*\).116 

<details><summary>Oghas (द्रष्टुं नोद्यम्)</summary>

It is worth pointing out the similarity of this scheme with that of the threefold “stream” or “flow” \( *ogha*\) of gurus that is named in such Śaiva Kaula works as the *Ciñcinīmatasārasamuccaya*, the *Kulārṇavatantra*, and in Maheśvarānanda’s *Mahārthamañjarīparimala* as the “celestial stream” \( *divyaugha*\), the “perfected stream” \( *siddhaugha*\) and the “human stream” \( *mānavaugha*\). On the evidence of the relatively late composition of each of these works, it would appear that this Śaiva scheme postdates the threefold classification of texts found in the Pāñcarātra. 
</details>


An earlier formulation of this scheme can be found in the *Sātvatasaṃhitā* \(SS\): 

*tatra vai trividhaṃ vākyaṃ divyaṃ ca munibhāṣitam* // *pauruṣaṃ cāravindākṣa tadbhedam avadhāraya * / *yad arthāḍhyam asandigdhaṃ svaccham alpākṣaraṃ*

>
> Thus, O wise one, know that scripture \( *āgama*\), which originates from statements which are appropriated \[in this way\], is an entire proclamation of law which reveals the correct path.” \(SS 22.52c-59b\) 

## divyam
In this context the designation “celestial” \( *divyam*\) indicates that the text is, quite literally, the “utterance” \(or “statement”, *vākyam*\) of God. The PārS informs us that the celestial teachings are “spoken” by Vāsudeva and then “circulated” by “\[lesser gods\] headed by Brahmā, Rudra and Indra”.117 The same verses are contained in the ĪS \(1.54-55\), and they are also alluded to in the *Pāñcarātrarakṣā* \(PRR 39.8 *ff*\), wherein Vedāntadeśika affirms that *divyam* means “directly established by God” \( *sākṣād bhagavatpraṇītaḥ*\). 

## munibhāṣitaśāstra
In the PārS \(10.339c-345b\) and the ĪS \(1.57c-63b\), the second group of scriptures \( *munibhāṣitaśāstra*\) is divided into *sāttvika*, *rājasa* and *tāmasa* works. This classification of texts according to the Sāṃkhyan theory of the three “strands” or dynamic tendencies \( *guṇa*\) inherent within the ground of materiality \( *prakṛti*\), is a strategy which is also encountered in the self-classification of certain Purāṇas.118 

### sāttvika
According to the PārS \(10.338-340b\) and the ĪS \(1.56-58b\), although *sāttvika* texts are communicated by lesser gods and sages, they are established in accordance with the content \( *arthajāla*\) that is learnt directly from Viṣṇu \(Puṇḍarīkākṣa\). 

Vedāntadeśika reiterates that this category of teaching is founded on the “bare narrative” that is heard directly from God.119

[^119]: PRR 39.13-14: *sākṣād bhagavataḥ śrutārthamātranibandhanarūpaṃ śāstraṃ sāttvikam*. [[80]]

### rājasa
The PārS \(10.340c-344\) teaches that a *rājasa* text is either partially based on this transmitted knowledge and partially on the author’s own understanding \( *svabuddhi*\), or it is a summary \( *saṃkṣepa*\) of God’s teaching “by Brahmā etc.” \( *brahmādibhiḥ*\), *or* it is a summary, written by sages, of God’s teaching *as learnt from* Brahmā etc. \( *brahmādibhyaḥ*\). 

There are two distinct types of *rājasa* text, namely Pañcarātra and Vaikhānasa \(see also ĪS 1.58c-62\). 

### tāmasa
A *tāmasa* text constitutes the thoughts \( *svavikalpa*\) of the sages alone \(PārS 10.345ab, ĪS 1.63ab\), while a *pauruṣaśāstra* is the creation of an ordinary person \( *manuja*, PārS 10.345cd, ĪS 1.63cd\). 

[^120]: As Smith \(1975: 66\) has pointed out, there is more than one Pāñcarātra text with this name. The *Īśvarasaṃhitā* listed here is very unlikely to be the extant, published ĪS.



## Members
Although the threefold \( *divya*, *munibhāṣita*, *pauruṣa*\) classification is already present in the SS, the PārS is, as far as I am aware, the only published Pāñcarātra text which grades specific scriptures according to this hierarchy. 

### divya
As outlined above, the SS, PauṣS and JS are the “celestial” scriptures.+++(5)+++ 

### munibhāṣita
#### sāttvika
Among those that are “spoken by sages”, the PārS counts itself alongside the *Īśvarasaṃhitā*,120 the *Bharadvājasaṃhitā*, the *Saumantavī*, the *Vaihāyasīsaṃhitā*, “the teaching that originated with the Citraśikhaṇḍins” \(named by Vedāntadeśika as the *Citraśikhaṇḍisaṃhitā* at PRR 40.4\), and the *Jayottara* as *sāttvika* texts.121 

<details><summary>Variant (द्रष्टुं नोद्यम्)</summary>

Rastelli \(2006: 111\) offers a variant reading of this passage, wherein the *Īśvarasaṃhitā*, *Bharadvājasaṃhitā* and *Saumantavī* are included as *divya* alongside the SS, PauṣS and JS, and the PārS is not included at all: “Höre: Sātvata, Pauṣkara und Jayākhya, \(376cd\) solchartige Śāstras sind göttlich \( *divya*\). Auch die Īśvarasaṃhitā, die Bharadvājasaṃhitā, \(377\) und die Saumantavī werden ,vom höchsten Herrscher stammend‘ \( *pārameśvara*\) genannt.” My own reading is in agreement with that of Vedāntadeśika in his PRR \(40.3-7\): *… sāttvatapauṣkarajayākhyādīni śāstrāṇi divyāni īśvarabhāradvājasaumantavapārameśvaravaihāyasacitraśikhaṇḍisaṃhitājayottarādīni sāttvikāni* *sanatkumārapadmodbhavaśātātapatejodraviṇamāyāvaibhavikādīni rājasāni* *pañcapraśna-śukapraśnatattvasāgarādīni tāmasānīti…*
</details>

#### rājasa
The *Sanatkumāra*, *Padmodbhava*, *Satyā*, *Tejodraviṇa* and *Māyāvaibhavika* are named as *rājasa* texts,122 

122 It is worth pointing out that the first two of these *rājasa* texts are among the “five jewels” enumerated at the end of the PādS \( *cp* 33.204-205b\) and discussed above.



#### tāmasa
and the *Pañcapraśna*, *Śukapraśna* and *Tattvasāgarasaṃhitā* as * tāmasa* texts.123

[[81]]

## pauruṣaśāstra
The “teachings of men” \( *pauruṣaśāstra*\) are not named. 

## Meta
### sāṅkaryam
Meanwhile, it is said that a “mixing together” \( *sāṅkaryam*\) of these scriptures should be avoided \(PārS 10.385cd, ĪS 23.33cd\). 

### Origins
What can this hierarchy of texts tell us about the attitude towards scriptural authority in the PārS? To what extent does this categorisation conform to the way in which the Pāñcarātra Saṃhitās are classified and enumerated in other Pāñcarātra works? 

To be sure, the threefold hierarchical scheme is borrowed from the SS, and was later incorporated from the PārS into the ĪS, but it is not found, as far as I am aware, in any other Pāñcarātra text. 

That the PārS grades specific scriptures according to this hierarchy is a significant development from the SS, which gives no obvious indication that it ranks itself among the “celestial” category. 

In a similar vein, the PārS’s characterisation of the JS is not derived from that work’s own self-description, for the present version of the JS, at least, contains a presentation of its own transmission which does not conform to the idea that it represents the *direct* revelation of God.124 

As in the SS, the classificatory scheme in the PārS ostensibly grades a textual statement \( *vākya*\) according to the identity of its author, but this neat structure is then set aside with the allowance that a human statement can gain the status of one that is “spoken by sages” providing that its content conforms to that of the celestial statements.125 This allowance reveals two key features of this system of classification. 

### Incomplete, open
Firstly, it is clear that we are not dealing here with either a “complete” or a “closed” canon of works, since it is admitted that the *munibhāṣita* category is open to additions.126 

#### JS divyam?
The opening *paṭala* of the JS begins with the sage Saṃvartaka approaching his father Aurva and asking him to tell of the means by which rebirth in *saṃsāra* can be avoided. In response, Aurva recites to Saṃvartaka a conversation between Nārada and God as he himself has heard it from Śāṇḍilya. 

However, Śāṇḍilya’s account of God’s teaching, learnt by Śāṇḍilya directly from Nārada, and repeated by Aurva to form the content of the Saṃhitā as we now possess it, is not a verbatim repetition of God’s utterances, but is rather an “abridgement” \( *saṃkṣiptam*, JS 1.50a\) of the same, in which only the “essence” \( *sārabhūtam*\) is selected for retelling \(JS 1.74cd\). Insofar as this abridgement has been performed by Śāṇḍilya himself, the dialogue between Nārada and God which begins at JS 2.31 and continues thereafter cannot be said to have been directly revealed by God. 

Indeed, according to its self-description as summarised here, the JS would fit better into the PārS’s category of *munibhāṣita* teachings of the *rājasa* type. 

[^125]: PārS 10.373-374b: *sāttvikādikramāt teṣu samabhyūhya mahāmate* / *prasiddhārthān upādāya saṅ-gatārthaṃ vilakṣaṇam* // *api cet pauruṣaṃ vākyaṃ tan munivākyavat* /. See also SS 22.57c-58b, on which this is based. 

[^126]: In this respect the delineation of the Pāñcarātra canon in the PārS does not conform to the somewhat limited definition of “canon” advanced by Jonathan Z. Smith in his influential essay *Sacred Persistance: Towards a Redescription of Canon*. Smith \(1982: 48, 52\) argues that “the element of 82  has closure transforms a catalogue into a canon”, and that “the essential structure of limitation and closure along with exegetical ingenuity remains constant.”

The “incompleteness” of the list of scriptures in the PārS is further 124 conveyed, as Rastelli \(2006: 127\) has pointed out, by the appendage of the terms “and so on, and so forth” \( *evamādīni*, *ityādīni*\) to the names of the Saṃhitās at each level of the hierarchy. This is the case even with the *divyaśāstra* s, suggesting the belief that this category may also be added to at a future time. It is also demonstrated by the fact that no Vaikhānasa works are named in the list of *rājasa* texts, despite the earlier claim that this category includes such works. 

### divya-standard
The second notable characteristic of this scheme which is highlighted by the admission that new texts can be included at the *munibhāṣita* level is that the *divya* texts are unambiguously posited as the standard by which all other texts must be measured. To acquire any sort of authority, a text which is not directly revealed by God must conform as closely as possible to the *divyaśāstra* s, and if it in any way contradicts \( *virodhi*\) these, it should be rejected.127 +++(4)+++

This premise mirrors to some extent the *vedamūlatva* principle as articulated in the Pūrvamīmāṃsā school and subsequently adopted by several South Indian Vedāntin thinkers.128 I shall comment further on the role of the *vedamūlatva* principle in the textual history of the Pāñcarātra in the following chapter. 

The author of the PārS accentuates the hierarchical structure of the canon by imposing an additional hierarchy \(in the form of *sāttvika*, *rājasa* and *tāmasa*\) onto the level of the *munibhāṣitaśāstra*. This strategy, an innovation from what is found in the SS, multiplies the number of levels which exist beneath the celestial teachings, the effect of which is that the authority of the latter is enhanced. 

#### Emphasis
The authority of the *divyaśāstra* s is also seemingly emphasised in the PārS’s scheme via the author’s omitting the SS’s claim that the *munibhāṣitaśāstra* s grant the *puruṣārtha* s as their fruit \( *phala*\) \(SS 22.55cd\). By omitting this verse, as Rastelli \(2006: 109-110\) 

[^127]: PārS 10.371c-372: *pārameśvaravākyārthair yad virodhi na tad dvija*// *saṃgrāhyaṃ sāttvikādyeṣu* *munivākyeṣu yatnataḥ*/ *yad divyāpekṣitaṃ vipra saṃgrāhyaṃ avirodhi tat*//. My comments here repeat the key points of Rastelli’s \(2006: 125-126\) analysis of this passage. 

[^128]: The similarity between the hierarchical system of the SS and the PārS and the *vedamūlatva* principle is also conveyed by Vedāntadeśika, in his comments on SS 22.52c-58b. Vedāntadeśika’s exegesis, which is later quoted approvingly by Alaśiṅgabhaṭṭa in his STBh \(522.4-6\), is undoubtedly less restrictive than the PārS in its willingness to place the *munibhāṣita* statements alongside the *divya*, but the Mīmāṃsaka terminology is familiar: *atra anirvāhakam ādyokteḥ iti divyamunibhāṣitayoḥ*

*viruddhārthatvam ucyate* \(PRR 29.16-17\). [[83]]

observed, the author removes any reference to the *munibhāṣitaśāstra* s’ capacity to confer *mokṣa*. In the PārS’s scheme the ability to confer *mokṣa* is expressly linked only with the *divyaśāstra* s \(see PārS 10.357ab\). Can we infer from this that the *munibhāṣita* texts are being presented here as soteriologically ineffective, as the Vedas are presented in the PārS’s opening *adhyāya*? Quite possibly, although such an inference is not unproblematic, especially if we have concluded, contra Rastelli, that the PārS counts * itself* among this group of texts, albeit as belonging to the superior \(i.e.*sāttvika*\) class.129 Whilst the *rājasa* texts certainly appear to be restricted to the granting of supernatural powers \( *siddhi*\),130 the capacity of the *sāttvika* texts is not explicitly stated here, and so their status with regard to this matter remains unclear. 

## Key features
However, if we limit our efforts, as seems advisable in this instance, to attempting to understand in more general terms the significance of this classificatory scheme, several key features appear indubitable. 

### divyaśāstra height
Firstly, the *divyaśāstra* s are to be regarded as being *substantially* different from all texts beneath them. While it is possible for new works to be *munivākyavat*, there is no such concept as *divyavākyavat*. 

The closest another text can come to the celestial teachings is to conform in its entirety with those direct utterances of God,131 and even then the capacity to grant *mokṣa* remains, *in this presentation*, exclusively associated with the celestial teachings. 

### munibhāṣitaśāstra limit
Secondly, the author of the PārS imposes a more limited capacity onto the *munibhāṣitaśāstra* s than is present in the SS’s scheme. This is achieved not only by omitting the reference to the *puruṣārtha* s, but also by the imposition of an internal hierarchy, so that, for instance, this level of text now incorporates works of the Vaikhānasa tradition, as well as \( *tāmasa*\) works which have no direct relation to god’s teaching. 

[^129]: The author of this section of the PārS certainly doesn’t indicate that the PārS should be considered as *divyaśāstra*, and bearing in mind that large sections of this text are incorporated from the SS, PauṣS and JS, it does seem reasonable to view the PārS as conforming to its own description of the *sāttvika* type of *munibhāṣitaśāstra*. 

[^130]: The description of the *rājasa* category at PārS 10.361-367b begins: “\[That which\] praises, as well as bestows, supernatural powers…” \( *praśaṃsakaṃ yat siddhīnāṃ saṃpravartakam apy atha*\). This line is incorporated from SS 22.54cd, where it is applied to the *munivākya* level in general. 

[^131]: Elsewhere the PārS presents *itself* as strictly conforming to the celestial teachings, though it does not make this claim in the passage under review. [[84]]

The restrictive, exclusivist approach of the PārS becomes more evident when it is compared to the delineation of the Pāñcarātra canon that is contained in the PādS. 


As in the PārS, the ‘Pañcarātra’ teaching \( *śāstra*\) is presented in the PādS as being superior to the Vedas, which are depicted as being unable to lead one to liberation. 

Thus, in the PādS’s opening chapter \( *jp* 1.92d-93b\) we read that “the tree which possesses the Kalpasūtras \[among its branches\] delivers everything that is desired to those who desire, except for liberation” \( *kalpakadrumaḥ*// *arthibhyo vāñchitaṃ* *sarvaṃ prayacchati gatiṃ vinā*\).132 In contrast to the PārS, however, the author of this section of the PādS incorporates the claim relating to the *puruṣārtha* s that is contained in the SS, and applies it to the Pāñcarātra scriptural tradition *in general*. Comparing the ‘Pañcarātra’ to the “tree which possesses the Kalpasūtras \[among its branches\]”, in other words the “Veda-tree”, we are told that “the teaching called Pañcarātra grants the group of four \[i.e. the *puruṣārtha* s\] as its fruit” \( *pañcarātrākhyaśāstraṃ tu* *caturvargaphalapradam*, PādS * jp* 1.93cd\). 

Shortly before enumerating 108 Pāñcarātra scriptures, the PādS’s narrator Saṃvarta declares that “Nārāyaṇa himself is the proclaimer of all the Tantras” 

\( *tantrāṇāṃ caiva sarveṣāṃ vaktā nārāyaṇaḥ svayam*, PādS *jp* 1.88cd\). This claim is also found in other South Indian Saṃhitās which contain extensive lists of Pāñcarātra works, such as the *Viśvāmitrasaṃhitā *\(ViśS\) and the *Bhāradvājasaṃhitā*.133 Such claims, of course, openly contradict the PārS’s assertion that only the three celestial scriptures are directly revealed by God. According to this section of the PādS, then, there is no hierarchy among the Pāñcarātra teachings, since all are revealed by God, and all grant the *puruṣārtha* s. The much more inclusive nature of this portion of the PādS is perhaps best exemplified by the declaration, in the final verse of the PādS’s opening *adhyāya*, that “a person who regularly recites aloud the names of the Tantras 132 See also PādS *jp* 1.2-3b, where the seers \( *ṛṣi*\) complain to Kaṇva that they have studied the Vedas together with their auxiliary parts \( *sāṅgopāṅga*\), but that this has not led them to liberation \( *kaivalya*\). 

[^133]: See for example ViśS 2.14-15, where it stated that the Tantras are “heard from the mouth of Nārāyaṇa” \( *nārāyaṇamukhāc chrutvā*, 14a\), and ViśS 4.1ab: *bhagavatparam ity uktaṃ tantram etat* *tvayā guro*/; and the *Bhāradvājasaṃhitā*, which is not available to me, but is reported by Smith \(1975: 321\) to contain the claim \(at 1.1-8a\) that “the Pāñcarātra system… came directly from the mouth of Viṣṇu.” [[85]]

is liberated from all evil, and attains eternal *brahman*.”134 The ViśS \(2.33cd\) contains a very similar claim: “One who knows these names of the Tantras is entitled to liberation” \( *etāni tantranāmāni yo jānāti sa muktibhāk*\). 

What can the contrast between the two types of canonical classification found in the PārS and the PādS teach us about the contexts from which these works emerged? 

Should the exclusivist attitude conveyed in the PārS be interpreted simply as being indicative of the Āgamasiddhāntins, who followed their own ritual system and claimed exclusive allegiance to the “original Veda”, in contrast to the Mantrasiddhāntins who performed both Pāñcarātrika and Vedic rites, and claimed that their texts were *based* *on* the Veda?135 In other words, were such attitudes somehow “intrinsic” to these traditions’ self-understanding, or might they also reflect their respective historical circumstances? To be sure, it seems very probable that the canonical list of scriptures found in the PārS predates the PādS’s much more extensive list. But might geography, as well as chronology, have been a determining factor here? In other words, could the environments in which these texts were produced, Śrīraṅgam in the case of the PārS 

and Kāñcīpuram in the case of the PādS, have been in any way relevant to the development of these contrasting ways of thinking about the Pāñcarātra scriptures? 

Much has been written on the “cosmopolitanism” and “religious pluralism” of Kāñcī during the medieval period \(e.g. Mumme 1988, Hopkins 2001\). The former Pallava capital remained an important mercantile centre throughout the era of Cōḷa rule, and thereafter it continued to host, as it had for several centuries, diverse religious communities. Although by the time of the twelfth century the once substantial Buddhist presence appears to have considerably diminished \(Monius 2001\), significant Jain and Vaiṣṇava communities remained, even while they struggled to compete with Śaiva groups for social dominance and Cōḷa patronage \(Champakalakshmi 1996\). In addition, a number of separate, powerful Brahminical communities surrounded the city \(Heitzman 2001\), a consequence of royally instituted 134 PādS *jp* 1.116: *tantrāṇāṃ nāmadheyāni yo nityaṃ paṭhate naraḥ* / *sarvapāpavinirmukto yāti* *brahma sanātanam* //. 

[^135]: I undertake a fuller discussion of this last point below. [[86]]

land grants \( *brahmadeya*\), while communities associated with competing philosophical traditions purportedly existed side by side in Kāñcī itself.136 

In comparison, Śrīraṇgam was a much smaller town with a decidedly less cosmopolitan atmosphere. The historian R. Champakalakshmi \(1987: 99\) describes Kāñcī as a “multi-temple centre” and contrasts it with Śrīraṅgam, an example of a 

“sacred centre which originated and evolved around a single cult centre”. Although the power and political influence of the ruling, Śaiva-oriented Cōḷas should not be underestimated,137 Śrīraṅgam was an overwhelmingly Vaiṣṇava town, dominated by the Raṅganāthasvāmin temple, a Vaiṣṇava equivalent in this respect to the Śaiva town of Cidambaram \(ibid.\). 

The main competition that the Pāñcarātra faced here was from the Vaikhānasa tradition. Hari Rao \(1976\) dicusses how the *Kōyiloḷuku*, the Śrīraṅgam temple chronicle, describes in great detail the substitution, by Rāmānuja, of a Vaikhānasa-based system of temple-worship for one based on the Pāñcarātra Saṃhitās. However, this did not signal the end of this competitive rivalry, since from 1223-1225 CE, Śrīraṅgam was occupied by the Oḍḍas, the army of the Eastern Gaṅga King Anaṅgabhīma III, who reinstated Vaikhānasa ritual practices throughout the short period of their occupation \(Spencer 1978: 18\). 

Bearing in mind that Rastelli assigns the composition of the PārS to a period subsequent to the career of Rāmānuja, and that she favours a date prior to the social and political upheavals which affected Śrīraṅgam during the thirteenth century, we might tentatively suppose that the PārS was partially, or even wholly, composed between these two events, in other words c. 1175-1223 CE. The fact that the Oḍḍas could reinstate a Vaikhānasa system of worship at least half a century after Rāmānuja’s own liturgical “reformation” suggests that this other Vaiṣṇava tradition must have maintained a relatively strong presence in Śrīraṅgam throughout this period. This may help to explain why the author of the section of the PārS addressed 

[^136]: Both Mumme \(1988: 8\) and Hopkins \(2001: 36\) refer to the presence in Kāñcī, during Vedāntadeśika’s time, of *maṭhas* associated with Vedānta, Nyāya and Mīmāṃsā. 

[^137]: Heitzman \(1997: 14\) writes of the period: “There is little indication that religious institutions in receipt of gifts set themselves up as separate political or military powers; instead, religious institutions and brāhmaṇas remained everywhere dependent on a secular arm which took care of these activities.” [[87]]

above felt the need to incorporate the Vaikhānasa tradition, at a lower level, within his own - an example of Paul Hacker’s \(e.g. 1995\) conception of *Inklusivismus*.138 

Employing a similar technique, the PādS \( *jp* 1.47abc\) asserts in its opening *adhyāya* that “There are six kinds of mutually contradictory Tantras which have you as their deity, O Śaṅkara” \( *ṣaṭprakārāṇi tantrāṇi tvad daivatyāni śaṅkara*/ *parasparaviruddhāni*\). At PādS *jp* 1.50-53, these six Tantras are shown to be Sāṃkhya, Yoga, Buddhism, Jainism, the Pāñcarātra and the Śaiva teachings \(the latter being subdivided into Kāpāla, Śuddhaśaiva, and Pāśupata\). Each of these are said to be “established on earth” by the Bhagavat \(PādS *jp* 1.48cd\),139 and the “unchecked” or “uncontrolled” emergence of the “other five” teachings is said to proceed “by Viṣṇu’s *māyā*” \( *vaiṣṇavyā māyayā loke pracaranti niraṅkuśāḥ*, PādS *jp* 1.57ab\). The very name ‘Pañcarātra’ is explained on the basis of these other five teachings: “The five \( *pañca*\) other great teachings are like night \(or ‘darkness’, *rātrī*\) in the presence of *that* \[i.e. Pañcarātra\]: \[so\] it comes forth into the world with that name.”[^140] 

It is highly unlikely that religio-philosophical systems called ‘Sāṃkhya’ and 

‘Yoga’ represented a significant challenge to the Pāñcarātra in twelfth and thirteenth century Kāñcīpuram. Rather, this list of teachings is much more likely to be a convenient shorthand for *all* of the religious paths alternative to the Pāñcarātra, with Sāṃkhya and Yoga retaining their older connotations of, respectively, knowledge-based and “action”-based soteriologies. Where the PārS incorporates the Vaikhānasa tradition within itself, then, the PādS appears to include and subordinate *all* religious traditions. I will discuss this strategy further in Chapter Six, in particular reference to the *Ahirbudhnyasaṃhitā*. Here it will suffice to ask: might such a religiously plural environment as Kāñcī encourage an inclusive attitude towards the scriptures of one’s 138 See also Halbfass’ \(1995\) Introduction. Elsewhere, at PārS 19.549 \(→ ĪS 21.586\), the Vaikhānasa system \( *tantra*\) is explicitly denounced, alongside that of the “Śaiva Pāśupatas”, as being contrary \( *viruddha*\) to the four Pāñcarātra Siddhāntas. 

[^139]: Among these, the Buddhist and Jain teachings are attributed to the Bhagavat himself, who is “skillful in the concealment of knowledge” \( *jñānāpahnavaniṣṇātam*\), and who “assumes the form” \( *mūrtiṃ* *samāsthāya*\) of these traditions’ teachers for his own purposes \(PādS *jp* 1.51-52b\). 

[^140]: PādS *jp* 1.72: *pañcatarāṇi śāstrāṇi rātrī yan te mahānty api*/ *tatsannidhau samākhyāsau tena loke* *pravartate*//. Cf. ViśS 2.6: *sāṃkhyayogādayaḥ pañca rātrāyante ’sya saṃnidhau*/ *tasmād vā*

*pañcarātrārthaḥ procyate sūrisattamaiḥ*//. * *– “The five \[teachings\] Sāṃkhya, Yoga etc. are eclipsed \( *rātrāyante*\) in the presence of this. Thus, the meaning of ‘Pañcarātra’ is explained by the best of sages.” Cf. also PauṣS 38.307c-308, wherein the “five nights” \( *pañcarātram*\) are Purāṇa, Veda, Vedānta, Sāṃkhya and Yoga. [[88]]

*own* tradition? Certainly, the competition for the control of temples that the Pāñcarātra faced in Kāñcī would have been more formidable than in “single-cult centres” such as Śrīraṅgam and Melkote, the town in present day Karnataka with which the ĪS has been associated for much of its history. Such a competitive environment is hardly likely to inspire a restrictive or delimiting approach to what could reasonably be claimed as one’s own scriptural corpus. As Yāmuna demonstrates in his ĀP, a unified and coherent, albeit internally diverse “system” is better equipped to counter opposition than an assemblage of distinct groups or texts. And if the question is turned around the other way, perhaps the Āgamasiddhantins in places such as Śrīraṅgam and Melkote had less reason to persuade outsiders of the magnitude of their own scriptural corpus, or of the essential unity of the broader tradition to which they belonged. Since these Āgamasiddhāntins had already explicitly rejected the Veda, there were presumably fewer outsiders who would consider accepting them anyway.[^141] 

The contrasts between Kāñcī and Śrīraṅgam which I have advanced here as being possibly relevant to differing methodological approaches towards Pāñcarātra canon-formation should not be taken too far, lest it be forgotten that both towns had close connections with each other throughout the medieval period and that, in addition to the Āgamasiddhāntins, Śrīraṅgam was also home to such influential figures as Yāmuna, Rāmānuja and Vedāntadeśika, all of whom evince in their work, albeit in different ways, the kind of “inclusive” or “cosmopolitan” attitudes that I have been associating here with Kāñcī. Moreover, an explanatory model based purely on a sort of 

“geographical determinism” is, in this instance, almost certainly unsuitable. However, it should nonetheless be noted that Āgamasiddhāntins do appear to have congregated in smaller single-cult centres, while works such as the PādS and the *Adhikaḥ Pāṭhaḥ*, whose authors alligned themselves with the Vedic tradition, and adopted a more *inclusive* approach to the Pāñcarātra scriptures, were products of a more cosmopolitan religious environment, in this case the multi-temple town of Kāñcī. 

[^141]: However, it should be noted that there *were*, according to the PādS, followers of the Vedas who joined the Ekāyana. PādS *cp* 21.54ab \(→ BhT 24.26ab\) reads: *ekāyane praviṣṭānāṃ traividyānām ayaṃ* *kramaḥ*/. [[89]]
