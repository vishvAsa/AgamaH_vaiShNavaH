title = "2 ii \\) The three jewels"

+++

General introductions to the Pāñcarātra literature commonly emphasise the exalted status of the JS, SS and PauṣS as the so-called “three jewels” \( *ratnatraya*\) of the scriptural corpus.32 However, despite its ubiquity in oral traditions and in the secondary Indological literature, the claim that these three works are supreme in the Pāñcarātra canon is itself contained in only four of the 35 published Saṃhitās, namely the *Pārameśvarasaṃhitā*, the *Īśvarasaṃhitā*, the *Śrīpraśnasaṃhitā*, and a late, interpolated section of the JS entitled *Adhikaḥ Pāṭhaḥ*. Further, as we will see below, only the latter among these works actually refers to the the JS, SS and PauṣS as the 

“three jewels”. Before proceeding to discuss ideas of textual hierarchy and canon in the Pāñcarātra literature in general, I will offer in this chapter a brief synopsis of the relevant passages from these four texts. 

Among these, the *Pārameśvarasaṃhitā* \(PārS\) is likely the earliest.33 Rastelli \(2006: 54, 98\) cautiously assigns the composition of this work to the period 1100-1300 CE, favouring the earlier half of this time frame on account of the social and political upheavals which affected Śrīraṅgam, the PārS’s likely place of origin, throughout the thirteenth century. She also highlights the derivative nature of the text. 

The PārS incorporates passages from the *Nārāyaṇīya * section of the *Mahābhārata*, the 31 That is, given that research on the Pāñcarātra in general is still relatively young. There are many better preserved works among the published Pāñcarātra Saṃhitās, and most of these have not yet been studied in any detail.

*Ahirbudhnyasaṃhitā*, and the *Pādmasaṃhitā *\(PādS\)34 among others, and its author, or 

“compiler” as Rastelli proposes, clearly also had a close knowledge of each of the 

“three jewels”. Rastelli \(2002: 9\) writes: “\[The\] compiler of the PārS turns to all three of these Saṃhitās with each topic that is also dealt with in one or more of these texts and incorporates in some cases very long passages from them. Some chapters of the PārS consist almost entirely of passages adopted from these three texts.” While there are several apparently earlier Saṃhitās which reveal a close knowledge of one or other of the JS, SS and PauṣS, it would appear that the PārS is one of the earliest extant Pāñcarātra Saṃhitās to display a close knowledge of all three texts. 

In the PārS’s opening chapter \( *adhyāya*\) the SS, PauṣS and JS are listed together and are said to confer both liberation and “enjoyments” \( *bhoga*\). This is in contradistinction to the “first teaching” \( *prathamaṃ śāstram*\), called here the “secret tradition” \( *rahasyāmnāya*\), which grants liberation only.35 We are told elsewhere in the first chapter that the three Saṃhitās were revealed for the benefit of those who had, from the time of the Tretā Age \( *yuga*\), given up the “supreme *dharma*” \(i.e. the secret tradition\), which refers only to Vāsudeva, and replaced it with a “mixed *dharma*” 

\( *miśradharma*\), which refers to other deities and fulfills other desires \( *kāma*\).36 In the present age these people “long again for that abode \[of Vāsudeva\]”, and so the three Saṃhitās are revealed, which are accessible to members of each social class \( *varṇa*\), and which combine a concern with worldly enjoyments \( *bhoga*\) as contained in the 

“mixed *dharma*” with the Vāsudeva-oriented soteriology of the “supreme *dharma*”.37 

Elsewhere in the PārS, this supreme *dharma* or “secret tradition” is also variously 34 Although the PārS is included in the canonical list of Pāñcarātra Saṃhitās contained in the PādS \( *jp* 1.105b\), this list is a late interpolation, and the PārS is likely the later text. See Rastelli \(2006: 58-9\). [[35]]

PārS 

1.16c-19b: **

*śrutvaivaṃ*

*prathamaṃ*

*śāstraṃ*

*rahasyāmnāyasaṃjñitam* 

// 

*divyamantrakramopetaṃ mokṣaikaphalalakṣaṇam* / *bhūyaḥ saṃcoditāt tasmāt tena lokahitaiṣiṇā* // 

*śrutaṃ vistarataḥ śāstraṃ bhogamokṣapradaṃ hi yat* / *anuṣṭupchandobaddhena proktaṃ bhagavatā* 

*svayam * // *sātvataṃ pauṣkaraṃ caiva jayākhyety evamādikam* /. 

[^36]: In other words, desires for enjoyments \( *bhoga*\) rather than for liberation. See PārS 1.75bcd: * tatas* *tretāyugādiṣu */ *vikāravedāḥ sarvatra devāntaragocarāḥ* //; 1.79: *tatas tretāyuge sarve* *nānākāmasamanvitāḥ */ *vyāmiśrayājino bhūtvā tyajyanty ādyaṃ sanātanam* //; and 1.87 \(see next note\). The “changed Vedas” \( *vikāravedāḥ*\) at 1.75c are to be understood as the same as the “mixed *dharma*” that is mentioned at 1.87b. 

[^37]: In addition to the verses in the previous note, see especially PārS 1.87-89: *parityajya paraṃ dharmaṃ*

*miśradharmam upeyuṣām */ *bhūyas tatpadakāṅkṣāṇāṃ śraddhābhaktī upeyuṣām *// *anugrahārthaṃ*

called the “root-Veda” or the “original Veda” \( *mūlaveda*, e.g. PārS 1.64b, 10.212c; *mūlaśruti*, PārS 1.63a\), the foremost Bhāgavata *dharma* \(PārS 1.78a\), the *dharma* of the Ekāntins \( *ekāntidharma*, PārS 1.60a\), the original *dharma* \( *prakṛtidharma*, PārS 

1.41a, 74c\), and the Ekāyanaveda \(e.g. PārS 1.32c, 56c\). 

The SS, PauṣS and JS are also mentioned together at PārS 10.376cd, this time in the context of a classification of Pāñcarātra scriptures into three distinct groups, namely 

the 

celestial 

teachings 

\( *divyaśāstra*\), 

the 

teachings 

of 

sages 

\( *munibhāṣitaśāstra*\), and the teachings of men \( *pauruṣaśāstra*\).38 Although this classification is already present in the SS,39 a text which was known to the author/compiler of the PārS, the theory that the SS, PauṣS and JS alone among Pāñcarātra scriptures represent the *direct* revelation of God \( *divyaśāstra*\) is, as far as we can tell, here expressed for the first time.40 I will discuss this passage in detail below. 

The author of the PārS directly relates his own text to this original revelation by claiming that it contains within itself the elucidation of the meaning of the PauṣS. 

Explaining the transmission of the teaching, Śāṇḍilya, the narrator of the PārS, says: *pārameśvaraśāstrāṇāṃ sarveṣāṃ munipuṅgava * / *sārabhūtaṃ viśeṣeṇa* *pauṣkarārthopapādakam* // *mūlavedānusāreṇa chandasānuṣṭubhena ca* / 

*lakṣagranthena sarvārthakriyājñānopalabdhaye *// *sa me ’bravīn mahāśāstraṃ*

*pārameśvarasaṃjñayā* //. – “So as \[for me\] to attain knowledge, and the accomplishment of all \[my\] objectives, he \[Saṃkarṣaṇa\] related to me the great teaching called Pārameśvara, which is in accordance with the root-Veda \( *mūlaveda*\), has *anuṣṭubh* as its metre, consists \[originally\] of one *lakh* of verses, which is, O best of sages, the true essence of all the teachings relating to the highest Lord \( *pārameśvaraśāstrāṇām*\), and which presents in particular the meaning of the Pauṣkara \[Saṃhitā\].” \(PārS 1.90-92b\) 

The *Īśvarasaṃhitā *\(ĪS\) also contains substantial derivative portions, incorporating numerous passages from the SS \(see Bock-Raming 2002: 352 *ff*\), and 38 For this classification see especially PārS 10.336-345, and the parallel verses at ĪS 1.54-63. 

[^39]: SS 22.52c-59b. Several of these verses, as Rastelli \(2006: 108 n. 202\) has shown, are included within a section of the tenth chapter of the PārS \(10.347-374b\). This whole section of the PārS is also included in the ĪS \(23.4-31b\). 

[^40]: See PārS 10.376c-377b: *sātvataṃ pauṣkaraṃ caiva jayākhyaṃ ca tathaiva ca* // *evamādīni śāstrāṇi* *divyānīty avadhāraya* /. It should be pointed out that Rastelli \(2006: 111 *ff*\) offers a different reading of the passage containing these verses. See my discussion “The Formation of the Pāñcarātra Canon” 

below. [[34]]

also borrowing liberally from the PārS. Like the PārS, this text is included in the canonical list of scriptures found in the PādS \( *jp* 1.103d\), but the ĪS is certainly the later text, probably not composed before the late thirteenth or fourteenth century \(Matsubara 1994: 28-31\). Numerous passages in the first chapter of the ĪS, a short history of the “descent” or genealogy of the Pāñcarātra scriptures \( *śāstrāvataraṇa*\), contain material which is apparently drawn directly from the PārS.41 The author refers to the three texts SS, PauṣS and JS again as the celestial \( *divya*\) teachings, which are proclaimed by Hari in the *anuṣṭubh* metre, and are “in accordance with the root-Veda”.42 A few lines later the text partially repeats itself with a verse, the first part of which is the same as PārS 10.376c-377b: 

*sātvataṃ pauṣkaraṃ caiva jayākhyaṃ ca tathaiva ca *// * evamādīni divyāni* *śāstrāṇi hariṇā svayam */ * mūlavedānusāreṇa proktāni hitakāmyayā *//. – “Such celestial teachings as the Sātvata, Pauṣkara and Jayākhya were taught by \[the Lord\] Hari himself, in accordance with the root-Veda, for the sake of the well-being of others.” \(ĪS 64c-65\) 

The ĪS goes on to liken the position of the three texts within the broader literature to that of three mantras – the eight-syllabled \( *aṣṭākṣara*\), the twelve-syllabled \( *dvādaśākṣara*\) and the six-syllabled \( *ṣaḍakṣara*\)43 - among all the mantras of Viṣṇu: “And this triad Sātvata etc. is pervasive, O best of sages, as is the triad of mantras *aṣṭākṣara* etc., O learned ones.”44 How are we to understand the term *vyāpaka* 41 Parallel verses, containing a few minor changes, between the first chapter of the ĪS and the PārS: ĪS 

1.1 ← PārS 1.1; ĪS 1.2cd ← PārS 1.3cd; ĪS 1.3ab ← PārS 1.4cd; ĪS 1.12ab ← PārS 1.25cd; ĪS 1.16ab

[^42]: ĪS 1.50-51a: *mūlavedānusāreṇa chandasānuṣṭubhena ca* / *sātvataṃ pauṣkaraṃ caiva jayākhyety* *evamādikam* // *divyaṃ sacchāstrajālaṃ*… 

[^43]: These are, respectively, OṂ NAMO NĀRĀYAṆĀYA, OṂ NAMO BHAGAVATE 

VĀSUDEVĀYA, and OṂ VIṢṆAVE NAMAḤ. 

[^44]: ĪS 1.66: *sātvatādyaṃ trikaṃ caitat vyāpakaṃ munisattamāḥ* / *yathā cāṣṭākṣarādīnāṃ* *mantrāṇāṃ*

*tritayaṃ budhāḥ* //. Rastelli’s \(1999a: 71\) translation of this verse into German reads: “Und diese Dreiheit Sātvata usw. ist umfassend, ihr besten Weisen, wie die Dreiheit \(d.h. die Silbe *oṃ*\) für Mantras wie den Aṣṭākṣara\[mantra\] und die anderen, ihr Weisen.” This reading might be justified with recourse to a passage in the SS \(9.37-41b\) in which the *bīja* and *piṇḍa* portions of a mantra are called 

“pervading” \( *vyāpaka*\) in distinction to the *saṃjñā* and *pada* portions which are “pervaded” \( *vyāpya*\). 

However, elsewhere in the ĪS the *aṣṭākṣara* is named as one of three mantras which are themselves 35 

in this context? In what sense are the three aforementioned mantras *vyāpaka* in their context? Elsewhere in the ĪS we are provided with an explanation: *sādhāraṇās tv ime mantrās trayaḥ* *sarvāsu* *mūrtiṣu* // *anye tu manavas* *tattanmūrtimātraparā hy ataḥ* / *vyāpakatritayenārcyāḥ sarvā api ca* *mūrtayaḥ* // 

*mantrair anyais tu sampūjyās tattanmūrtaya eva hi* / *tasmāt sarveṣu mantreṣu* *vyāpakatritayaṃ varam* //. – “These three mantras are applicable in \[the worship of\] all \[divine\] manifestations, while other formulas are only applicable to this or that particular manifestation. Indeed, all \[divine\] manifestations can be worshipped with the triad of pervasive \[mantras\], while particular \[individual\] 

manifestations are \[also\] worshipped with other mantras. Therefore, among all mantras the triad of pervasive \[ones\] is superior.” \(ĪS 23.53c-55b\) According to the author of this passage, then, the superiority of the “pervasive” 

or “comprehensive” mantras rests on their general applicability in Pāñcarātra worship. 

This is in contrast to other mantras, which are applicable only in the worship of “this or that” \( *tattat*\) particular divine manifestation. By describing the SS, PauṣS and JS as 

“pervasive” in the manner of these mantras, the author is therefore expressing the idea that these three “celestial” scriptures have a *general * applicability in any context of Pāñcarātra worship, and this is to be understood alongside the concomitant idea that the applicability of other scriptures is limited to their own *specific* contexts. “Context” 

here refers primarily to the temple in which a particular scripture is in use. When the author then admits that the SS, PauṣS and JS are linked with, respectively, Yādavācala \(Melkote\), Śrīraṅgam and Hastiśaila \(Kāñcīpuram\),45 he is able to provide this information having already established the fact that their use is not limited to these places. 

called “pervasive” \( *vyāpaka*\): *sarveṣu viṣṇumantreṣu mantrāḥ syur vyāpakās trayaḥ* / *ādyaṃ*

*nārāyaṇāṣṭārṇaṃ dvitīyaṃ dvādaśākṣaram* // * vāsudevasya yogīndrās tato viṣṇuṣaḍakṣaram* /. – 

“Among all the mantras of Viṣṇu, there are three pervasive mantras. The first has eight syllables and is of Nārāyaṇa, the second has twelve syllables and is of Vāsudeva, and then, most excellent Yogins, there is the six syllabled \[mantra\] of Viṣṇu” \(ĪS 23.52-53b\). We are subsequently told: *triṣv apy eṣu* *vyāpakeṣu mantro hy aṣṭākṣaro ’dhikaḥ* /. – “Indeed, among these three pervasive \[ones\], the *aṣṭākṣara* mantra is superior” \(ĪS 23.56ab\). These three mantras are also considered together in the *Lakṣmītantra* at 24.68 *ff*, where they are said to constitute three of the five *vyāpaka* mantras in the Pāñcarātra \(74cd\). 

[^45]: ĪS 1.67: *etat tantratrayoktena vidhinā yādavācale* / *śrīraṅge hastiśaile ca kramāt sampūjyate hariḥ* 

//. The later *Adhikaḥ Pāṭhaḥ* section of the JS \(12c-13b\) also associates these texts with these places: *sāttvataṃ yaduśailendre śrīraṅge pauṣkaraṃ tathā* // *hastiśaile jayākhyaṃ ca sāmrājyam adhitiṣṭhati* 

/. [[36]]

We also find in the ĪS \(1.54-63\) the same passage classifying Pāñcarātra scriptures into three groups \( *divya*, *munibhāṣita*, and *pauruṣa*\) that is contained in the PārS \(10.336-345\), as well as the device of appending itself to one of the three jewels, in this case the SS, the meaning of which the ĪS \(25.213b\) claims to be “illuminating” 

\( *prakāśikā*\). In a passage which is similar to the aforementioned Pārs 1.90, Nārada explains to the sages gathered at the Badarī hermitage: *atas sākṣād īśvaroktaśāstrāṇāṃ dvijapuṅgavāḥ* // * sārabhūtaṃ viśeṣeṇa* *sātvatārthopapādakam* / * īśvarākhyam idaṃ tantraṃ sākṣāt saṅkarṣaṇāc chrutam* 

// *sampravakṣyāmi*… //. – “Therefore, O best among the twice-born, I will enunciate this tantra called Īśvara, heard directly from Saṅkarṣaṇa, which is the true essence of the teachings which are directly revealed by God, and which presents in particular the meaning of the Sātvata \[Saṃhitā\].” \(ĪS 1.69c-71a\) A ‘Śrīpraśna’ is also mentioned in the canonical list of the PādS \( *jp* 1.101a\) but, like both the PārS and the ĪS, the *Śrīpraśnasaṃhitā *\(ŚrīprśS\) is almost certainly later than the bulk of this text. The chronology proposed by Raghavan \(1969\) places it as roughly contemporary with the ĪS, with the ŚrīprśS likely to be the later of the two works. Like both the PārS and the ĪS, the ŚrīprśS contains substantial derivative portions. It reproduces a significant number of verses verbatim from the ‘Kriyāpāda’ 

section of the PādS, and also shares parallel verses with the SS and the ĪS 

\(Padmanabhan 1969\). In a similar manner to the PārS and the ĪS, the ŚrīprśS refers to the SS, PauṣS and JS as the celestial \( *divya*\) scriptures in a passage which contains strong echoes of PārS 1.77 and ĪS 1.25,46 and which also refers to an original Pāñcarātra teaching \( *śāstra*\) called the “root-Veda” \( *mūlaveda*\): *jaganmūlaṃ vāsudevaṃ mukhyataḥ pratyapādayat *// * tac chāstraṃ mūla-vedākhyam ity api procyate budhaiḥ * / * adhyetṛbhedam āśritya śāstram etat* *tridhā rame *// * sāttvataṃ pauṣkaraṃ caiva jayākhyaṃ ca bhaviṣyati */ * athaitāḥ*

*saṃhitā divyāḥ vadiṣyanti vipaścitaḥ* //. – “The teaching is designated with the name *mūlaveda* by the learned because it primarily expounded upon Vāsudeva 

\[who is\] the root of the world. Owing to there being differences among students, I delight \[in the fact that\] this teaching will become threefold: Sāttvata, Pauṣkara 46 PārS 1.77 *: jaganmūlasya devasya vāsudevasya mukhyataḥ */ * pratipādakatā siddhā mūlavedākhyatā*

*dvija* //; ĪS 1.25 *: jaganmūlasya vedasya vāsudevasya mukhyataḥ */ * pratipādakatā siddhā*

*mūlavedākhyatā dvijāḥ* //. [[37]]

and Jayākhya. Thus the learned will say these Saṃhitās are celestial.” \(ŚrīprśS 

49.471c-473\) 

These verses articulate a rather different understanding, then, of the relation between the three celestial Saṃhitās and the original teaching. Where the PārS \(1.87-89\) and the ĪS \(1.47-51\) present the JS, SS and PauṣS as combining the soteriology of the root-Veda with the granting of enjoyments \( *bhoga*\) as found in the “mixed *dharma*”, and as having been revealed by god for the benefit of those who had abandoned the former in favour of the latter, in this passage the ŚrīprśS presents the three celestial Saṃhitās as themselves distinct manifestations of the root-Veda. 

The section of the JS entitled *Adhikaḥ Pāṭhaḥ* \(literally “additional text”\) consists of 163 *śloka* s, which have been interpolated between the JS’s first and second chapters. The *Adhikaḥ Pāṭhaḥ* offers the most substantial account of the “three jewels” 

theory, as well as an interesting and unique interpretation as to how the three texts relate to one another. The narrator explains: 

47

*pañcarātrasya kṛtsnasya vaktā nārāyaṇaḥ svayam * / *iti sarvatra vikhyātaṃ* 

*bhagavacchāstragauravam* // *sāttvataṃ pauṣkaraṃ caiva jayākhyaṃ* *tantram* *uttamam * / *ratnatrayam iti khyātaṃ tadviśeṣa ihocyate* // *sāraṃ*

*sāttvataśāstrasya* *rahasyaṃ prājñasaṃmatam* / *ratnatrayam idaṃ sākṣād* *bhagavadvaktraniḥsṛtam* // *pravartitaṃ tathaivedam anyūnānadhikatvataḥ* / 

*anyānyāni tu tantrāṇi bhagavanmukhanirgatam* // *sāraṃ samupajīvyaiva* *samāsavyāsadhāraṇaiḥ* / *vyākhyopabṛṃhaṇanyāyād vyāpitāni tathā tathā * // 

*vyākhyāmūlanayenaiṣāṃ gauravaṃ sampratiṣṭhitam* /. – “Nārāyaṇa himself is the proclaimer of the whole of the Pañcarātra. The venerability of the teaching of the Bhagavat is thus known everywhere. The Sāttvata, Pauṣkara and Jayākhya are 

\[collectively\] the highest Tantra, called the “three jewels”. Its particularity is explained here. The essence of the Sāttvata teaching is a secret that is honoured by sages. This triad of jewels has come forth directly from the mouth of the Bhagavat, so indeed this \[triad\] is established as neither deficient nor excessive. 

After the tantras established themselves \[out of\] the essence emanating from the mouth of the Bhagavat, they supplemented \( *vyāpitāni*, literally “pervaded”\) one another with a commentary \(or “explanation”, *vyākhyā*\), \[that is\] based upon a 47 Cf. *Mahābhārata *\(MBh\) 12.337.63ab: *pañcarātrasya kṛtsnasya vettā tu bhagavān svayam* /. In his *Āgamaprāmāṇya* \(128.4\), Yāmuna quotes this verse \(“Thus it is taught in the *Mahābhārata*…”, *paṭhyate bhārate tathā*\) but in the version which is found in the main text above, i.e. in the opening verse of the *Adhikaḥ* *Pāṭhaḥ*: *pañcarātrasya kṛtsnasya vaktā nārāyaṇaḥ svayam*. It is later quoted by Rāmānuja, alongside other passages from the MBh, in his *Śrībhāṣya* on *sūtra* 2.2.42 \(334.1\) and, later still, by Madhva in his commentary on the MBh, the *Mahābhāratatātparyanirṇaya* \(2.101ab\). The *Pāñcarātrarakṣā* contains the verse at 43.9-10. Each of these works predates the *Adhikaḥ Pāṭhaḥ* \(for the dating of which see below\). [[38]]

principle of strengthening \[the “essence” or “root text”\], and in such a way \[these tantras can be characterised\] by their possessing both brevity \[i.e. in the form of the root text\], and detail \[in the form of the commentary\]. Indeed the venerability of these \[texts\] is established on the grounds of \[this combination of\] commentary and root \[text\].” \(JS *ap* 1-6b\) 

As far as I am aware, this is the only passage in any extant Pāñcarātra text in which the relationship between the “three jewels” is characterised in this way. As we have seen above, the PārS, ĪS and ŚrīprśS all indicate the common origin of the JS, SS 

and PauṣS in their references to a “root-Veda”, or an “original Veda” \( *mūlaveda*\). That which distinguishes the above account, however, is the idea that the three texts remain interdependent even after they have emerged from the same source \(here simply 

“essence”, *sāra*\), and that each of them supplements the other in the manner of root text and commentary. Rastelli \(1999: 54\) explains their relation in this context thus: 

“Jede Saṃhitā beinhaltet einen Teil der von Gott verkündeten Lehre, und zwar in der Weise, dass eine die andere ergänzt bzw. eine den Stoff ausführlicher erklärt, welcher in einer anderen nur kurz angerissen wird” \(“Each Saṃhitā contains a part of God’s teaching in such a way that one completes the other. Where one explains some material in detail, in the other it will be described only briefly”\). In other words, none of these texts can be fully understood except when read in tandem with the others, since the three taken together constitute a single teaching \( *śāstra*\). The narrator himself explains this a few lines later: 

*mūlavyākhyānarūpatvād upajīvyaṃ parasparam* // *tantratrayam idaṃ vidyād* *ekaśāstraṃ tathā budhaḥ* /. – “Owing to the form of root \[text\] and commentary, the three Tantras are mutually supportive, so the learned should know that this 

\[threefold Tantra\] is a single teaching.” \(JS *ap* 11c-12b\) The *Adhikaḥ Pāṭhaḥ* is also unique among the aforementioned Pāñcarātra works in that it is the only one which actually contains the term *ratnatraya*. The prevalence of this term in the secondary Indological literature therefore far outweighs its presence in the Pāñcarātra scriptures themselves, where it occurs only in this late, interpolated section of the JS. In fact, to my knowledge, the only other extant Sanskrit text of this period which contains the term in reference to Pāñcarātra scriptures is the 39 

*Pāñcarātrarakṣā* \(PRR\) of Veṅkaṭanātha - hereafter referred to as ‘Vedāntadeśika’, the honorific by which he is now more commonly known. Vedāntadeśika belonged, at that time, to the Śrīvaiṣṇava community at Śrīraṅgam. In the PRR, as in the *Adhikaḥ*

*Pāṭhaḥ*, the renowned \( *prasiddha*\) scriptures called the “three jewels” are characterised by their having come forth directly from the mouth of God.48 

The *Adhikaḥ Pāṭhaḥ* and the PRR, the only two extant works which employ this term *ratnatraya* to describe Pāñcarātra scriptures, were in all likelihood both written during the fourteenth century, the former in Kāñcīpuram and the latter in Śrīraṅgam. 

The *Adhikaḥ Pāṭhaḥ* was written, at least partly, to eulogise the Varadarājasvāmin temple in Kāñcī \(referred to as *Hastiśaila* throughout\). The general date of its composition is provided by Rajan \(1981: 27\), whose fourteenth century estimate is based on the correlation of architectural descriptions contained in the text with historical data concerning the construction of the temple building. Meanwhile, although the PRR is likely to have been written during its author’s first stint as an *ācārya* at Śrīraṅgam,49 Vedāntadeśika \(whose traditional dates are 1268-1369\) did spend his formative years in Kāñcīpuram, and his writings exerted considerable influence in this city during his lifetime as well as after his death \(Raman 1975: 70 *ff*, Hopkins 2002\).50 It is not therefore wholly implausible to suggest that the author of the *Adhikaḥ Pāṭhaḥ* might have been familiar with the PRR.51 At any rate, if Rajan is correct in identifying the *gopura* described in the *Adhikaḥ Pāṭhaḥ* with one added to the Varadarājasvāmin temple during the Vijayanagar period, it is fairly safe to assume that this interpolated section of the JS was composed during the second half of the 48 PRR 47.6-7: *yathoktaṃ sākṣād bhagavanmukhodgatatayā ratnatrayam iti prasiddheṣu jayākhya-sāttvatapauṣkareṣu*… 

[^49]: In other words, during the period before the second sack of Śrīraṅgam by Muslim forces in 1323. See Singh \(1958: 100\), and Hari Rao \(1976: 116-17\). 

[^50]: Vedāntadeśika wrote a *stotra*, the *Varadarājapañcāśat*, in praise of Lord Varadarāja at Kāñcī, and was intimately connected with this temple in his early years. 

[^51]: Of course this does not enable us to conclude that the author of the *Adhikaḥ Pāṭhaḥ* directly borrowed from the PRR, for \(an\)other text/s no longer available to us may also have characterised the JS, SS and PauṣS as *ratnatraya*. However, the influence of the teachings of *Viśiṣṭādvaitavedānta* are clearly discernible in the *Adhikaḥ Pāṭhaḥ* \(see, for example, JS *ap* 109\), and Vedāntadeśika was a very important figure in that *milieu* during this period. [[40]]

fourteenth century, during the 1360s at the very earliest,52 and is therefore almost certainly later than the PRR. 

This would mean of course that the composition of the *Adhikaḥ Pāṭhaḥ* was also subsequent to that of the PārS and the ĪS. That the *Adhikaḥ Pāṭhaḥ* contains the claim, found in both the PārS and the ĪS, that these two texts serve to elucidate, respectively, the PauṣS and the SS, further bears witness to its later composition. The author of the *Adhikaḥ Pāṭhaḥ* tells us: 

*tantre ’py aṣṭottaraśate parameśvarasaṃhitā* // *pauṣkarārthavivṛtyarthā*

*vyākhyārūpā* ’ *vatāritā */ *sāttvatasya vivṛtyartham īśvaraṃ tantram uttamam* // 

*jayākhyasyāsya tantrasya vyākhyānaṃ pādmam ucyate* /. – “Also, among the 108 

tantras, the *Parameśvarasaṃhitā* was transmitted \( *avatāritā*, literally “brought down”\) in the form of a commentary \( *vyākhyā*\), \[whose\] purpose is the explanation of the meaning of the Pauṣkara \[Saṃhitā\]. The Īśvara \[Saṃhitā\] is the highest tantra \[whose\] purpose is the explanation of the Sāttvata \[Saṃhitā\]. The commentary on the Jayākhya Tantra is called the Pādma \[Saṃhitā\].” \(JS *ap* 6c-8b\) 

Whilst the PārS and the ĪS, as we have established, themselves claim association with, respectively, the PauṣS and the SS, the *Pādmasaṃhitā *\(PādS\) does not link itself to the JS in the manner described above. Indeed, it is tempting to conclude that this single verse in the *Adhikaḥ Pāṭhaḥ* has provided the basis for the claim, which has been perpetuated in a number of modern exegetical and scholarly works \(e.g. 

Padmanabhan 1974: 29, Varadachari 1982: 287, Colas 2009: 155\), that the PādS is 

“based on” or “derived from” the JS. This explanation appeals because although the 

‘Jñānapāda’ section of the PādS appears to have incorporated several passages from the fourth chapter of the JS \(Rastelli 1999a\), in general the PādS owes little to the earlier work, and contains a wealth of information, especially on the subject of the construction of temples, which is wholly absent from the JS. It is indicative, indeed, that the JS’s 20th *paṭala*, wherein the majority of this work’s architectural detail is to 52 According to K.V. Raman \(1975: 26\) Kāñcī did not come under Vijayanagar dominance until the 1360s. The outer, western *gopura* of the Varadarājasvāmin temple \(i.e. that which Rajan identifies as being described in the *Adhikaḥ Pāṭhaḥ*\) is likely to have been built following Vijayanagar leader Kumāra Kampana’s arrival in the city, sometime during, or shortly after, 1361. The earliest dateable inscription found on the plinth portion of the *gopura* belongs to Kampana and is dated 1374. On this see Raman \(ibid: 54\). [[41]]

be found, shares no significant data with the PādS, and describes a style of temple which is not referred to by the latter \(see Rajan 1981\). It is worth mentioning, in addition, that the status of the PādS as a “commentary” on the JS does not appear to have been accepted always by the traditions which have inherited and used these texts. 

For the nineteenth century Śrīvaiṣṇava author Alaśiṅgabhaṭṭa writes in his commentary on the ĪS, the *Sātvatārthaprakāśikā* \(SāPr\), that in fact it is the *Lakṣmītantra* \(LT\) that is the commentary \( *vṛtti*\) on the JS, and that the PādS is only consulted by the priests of the Hastiśailanātha \(i.e. Vāradarājasvāmin\) temple on those subjects \(specifically “festivals etc.”\) which the LT does not cover.53 

In the context of the three jewels the PādS is important for its presentation of an alternative scriptural hierarchy, not found elsewhere in the extant literature. At the very end of this long text, we encounter the claim that there are “five jewels”, and these do not include the JS, SS or PauṣS: 

*tantrāṇāṃ caiva ratnāni pañcāhuḥ paramarṣayaḥ* / *pādmaṃ sanatkumāraṃ ca* *tathā paramasaṃhitā* // *padmodbhavaṃ ca māhendraṃ kaṇva tantrāmṛtāni ca* 

/. – “Eminent sages name five jewels among the tantras: Pādma, Sanatkumāra, Paramasaṃhitā, Padmodbhava and Māhendra are the immortal tantras O Kaṇva.” 

\(PādS *cp* 33.204-205b\) 

We are faced here, at least ostensibly, with a somewhat puzzling situation. 

Whilst the author of the *Adhikaḥ Pāṭhaḥ* tells us that the PādS is a commentary on the JS, and is in use in the same temple in Kāñcīpuram as that text,54 the PādS itself does not include the JS in its list of “five jewels”, those scriptures which, we can presumably infer, the author of the above passage considered superior within his tradition. Leaving aside for the moment the question of why the author of the *Adhikaḥ*

*Pāṭhaḥ* might have made this claim on behalf of the PādS \(I will discuss this question below\), we must first attempt to explain why the JS is not included in this list. 

[^53]: SāPr on ĪS 1.64-67: *idaṃ sātvatapauṣkarajayākhyatantratrayam… īśvarapārameśvaralakṣmī-tantrākhyatantratrayaṃ krameṇa teṣāṃ vṛttirūpam */ *tatreśvarapārameśvarayor utsavādīnāṃ*

*pauṣkalyam asti */ *lakṣmītantre tu tan nāsti */ *ataḥ ‘anuktam anyato grāhyam’ ity uktarītyā*

*hastiśailanāthārcakaiḥ padmoktānām utsavādyācārāṇāṃ parigrahaḥ kṛta iti… */. 

[^54]: On the JS’s and the PādS’s association with Kāñcī see JS *ap* 13-14b: *hastiśaile jayākhyaṃ ca* *sāmrājyam adhitiṣṭhati* */ pādmatantraṃ hastiśaile*… // … *kāryakāri pracāryate* /. On the JS’s association with Kāñcī at the time of the composition of the ĪS, see ĪS 1.67. **[[42]]

There are, on the face of it, at least two possible explanations for its omission. 

The first is simply that the composition of this portion of the PādS was complete before the idea of the supremacy of the JS, SS and PauṣS became current.55 Given that it appears quite probable that the PārS \(the earliest extant text to list the JS, SS and PauṣS as the “celestial” scriptures\) incorporated passages from the PādS and is therefore later than the bulk of that text, it is certainly a possibility that the composition of this section of the PādS predated the idea of the superiority of the three aforementioned scriptures. However, we can be certain that the PādS’s list of canonical scriptures \(at *jp * 1.99-114\) was added to the main body of the text at a much later date \(as can be inferred from the inclusion within the list of demonstrably later scriptures such as the ĪS and the ŚrīprśS\), and this shows that additions were still being made to the PādS at a time when the theory of the supremacy of the JS, SS and PauṣS was already quite well established. Indeed, the fact that its list of “five jewels” 

occurs at the very end of the PādS might well suggest that this passage is itself a later addition. 

The second possible explanation is that the author of the passage in question in the PādS belonged to a tradition within the Pāñcarātra which did not at that time accept the supremacy of the JS, SS and PauṣS. The fact that the PādS describes *itself* as “celestial” \( *divyam*\) at the beginning of the second chapter \( *jp* 2.3a\) is perhaps worthy of note, though it was quite common for authors to present their texts in such terms, regardless of the tradition they belonged to. Be that as it may, the theory that the PādS did originate from a tradition within the Pāñcarātra which was distinct from the tradition to which at least the PārS and the ĪS belonged is a compelling one, and it is the subject of distinct traditions within the Pāñcarātra to which I shall turn next. 

[^55]: As is the case with much of the anonymous Pāñcarātra literature, the PādS is certainly not a homogeneous, singly authored work, and so it is difficult to establish its date and provenance. Rastelli \(2003\) claims that its date can be determined only in relation to other Saṃhitās, and places the bulk of its composition between that of the *Paramasaṃhitā* \(ParS\), from which it borrows, and that of the PārS. 

Her suggestion that it is subsequent to the *Ahirbudhnyasaṃhitā* \(AS\) as well as to the lifetime of Rāmānuja would most likely place it towards the end of the twelfth century, or shortly thereafter. [[43]]
