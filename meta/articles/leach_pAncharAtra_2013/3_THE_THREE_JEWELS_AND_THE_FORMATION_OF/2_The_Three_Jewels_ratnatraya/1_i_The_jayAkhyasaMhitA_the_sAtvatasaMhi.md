The *Jayākhyasaṃhitā* \(JS\), the *Sātvatasaṃhitā* \(SS\), and the *Pauṣkarasaṃhitā* 

\(PauṣS\) are assigned by modern scholars to the earliest stratum of extant Pāñcarātra scriptural literature. This earliest stratum has recently been enlarged with the discovery of several Pāñcarātra texts in Nepalese palm-leaf manuscripts. Four of these as yet unpublished works have been named by Alexis Sanderson \(2009: 62 *ff*\) as the *Svāyambhuvapañcarātra*, * * the *Devāmṛtapañcarātra*, the *Vāsudevakalpa* of the *Mahālakṣmīsaṃhitā*, and the *Jayottaratantra*.27 They are currently being edited for publication by Diwakar Acharya \(Acharya 2010\). According to both Sanderson \(2009, 2009b\) and Acharya \(2010\), each of these recently discovered texts appear to be older than the JS, SS and PauṣS, which Sanderson \(2009: 62 *ff*\) argues are unlikely to have been written before the middle of the ninth century. Sanderson arrives at this *terminus* *post quem* on the basis of several factors, the most decisive of which is that the JS and the SS teach the visualisation of a four-faced form of Vāsudeva, called Vaikuṇṭha in the JS \(6.73c-74\) and Śaktyātman or Śaktīśa in the SS \(12.9-19\). The earliest surviving stone and bronze sculptures depicting four-faced forms of Viṣṇu \(an innovation on earlier three-faced depictions\) can be dated to c. 850 CE, and are found almost exclusively in Kashmir \(see also Sanderson 2005: 283-84\). Moreover, all three Pāñcarātra works, according to Sanderson, incorporate ritual practices and terminology from sources belonging to a mature stage in the development of Saiddhāntika Śaiva ritual \(see also Sanderson 2001: 38 n. 50\). On the basis of their 27 Of these, the *Devāmṛtapañcarātra* is the only title that is unequivocally absent from later canonical lists. A ‘Svāyambhuva’ is included in the list of Pāñcarātra scriptures contained in the *ādikāṇḍa* \(2.1-6\) of the *Hayaśīrṣapañcarātra*, also known as the *Hayagrīvasaṃhitā*, and in the very similar list contained in the *Agnipurāṇa* 39.1-5; a ‘Mahālakṣmī’ is named in lists of Pāñcarātra scriptures found in the *Kapiñjala*, *Śrīpuruṣottama*, *Bhāradvāja*, and *Viśvāmitra* Saṃhitās; and a ‘Jayottara’ is listed in the *Viṣṇutantra*, as well as in the *Kapiñjala*, *Bhāradvāja*, *Pādma* and *Pārameśvara* Saṃhitās, and in Vedāntadeśika’s *Pañcarātrarakṣā* \(40.3-7\), which gives a list parallel to that found in the *Pārameśvarasaṃhitā* \(at 10.376c-382b\). [[29]]

more “sophisticated” language and the fact that they have better assimilated material from Śaiva sources, Sanderson \(2009: 68-9\) believes that the SS and the PauṣS are probably the latest of the “early” Pāñcarātra works. 

The conclusions arrived at by Sanderson with regard to the dating of our earliest Pāñcarātra scriptures represent a significant departure from previous scholarship on this subject which, as recently as 1994, favoured the much earlier date of c. 500 CE for the composition of the JS, SS and PauṣS \(Matsubara 1994: 34\). The allocation of this earlier date was largely based on the assumption that the *Ahirbudhnyasaṃhitā*, which itself refers to the JS and the SS, was known to the Kashmirian author Bhagavadutpala 

– an assumption which Sanderson \(2001: 35-8\) convincingly argues is unwarranted. 

With regard to the provenance of the earliest works, Schrader \(1916\), Matsubara \(1994\), and Sanderson \(2009, 2009b\) agree upon a Kashmirian origin, while K. V. 

Soundara Rajan \(1981\), in a useful study of the JS’s 20th *paṭala*, argues that this chapter displays a knowledge of both Northern and Southern temple styles, and that the JS as a whole can therefore be assigned to Central India or the Upper Deccan, where both architectural forms were in concurrent use from an early period. 

As I will demonstrate in later chapters, the present versions of the JS, SS and PauṣS all contain material which appears to have been interpolated in South India. In light of this, assigning these texts *en bloc* to one particular geographic region, or to one particular historical period, especially on the basis of a single, isolated passage or chapter, is surely a mistake. These are clearly not homogeneous, singly authored works, and it is hardly possible to retrieve the “original” Saṃhitās from the versions which have come down to us. Discrete passages and sometimes whole chapters have been added to these texts, and we must assume that the redactors responsible for these additions have also, on occasion, deleted passages from the older layers. Such a scenario would at least help to explain why the present versions of the SS and the PauṣS, in particular, contain large sections which appear to be so arbitrarily structured, and are so evidently incomplete.28 

Owing to the heterogeneous authorship of these works, then, it is very difficult to establish a *terminus ad quem* for their composition. That both the JS and the SS are 28 On the SS’s structure, and its likely added and missing portions, see especially Smith \(1975: 534-35\). [[30]]

named as well as quoted by the Kashmirian author Bhagavadutpala tells us, at any rate, that these texts existed in Kashmir in some form during his lifetime. Although Bhagavadutpala’s dates are themselves far from certain, he is unlikely to have written his *Spandapradīpikā* \(SpPr\) before the middle of the tenth century, the period assigned to him by Dyczkowski \(1994: 29\). Bhagavadutpala quotes from the JS, which he also calls *Śrījayā* \(SpPr 12.2\) and simply *Jayā *\(SpPr 35.24, 56.16\), on four occasions, and in each instance the verses are found in the present edition of this text. We can be sure, then, that the older parts of the extant JS were composed before c. 950 CE, while the presumably youngest section of this text, as we will see below, was added during the second half of the fourteenth century. Meanwhile, the SS, or the *Śrīsātvatā* \(SpPr 21.22\) is quoted once by Bhagavadutpala, though only the first of the two *śloka* s quoted is found in the present version of the SS \(at 18.128\). As I will argue below, it is my opinion that the final two chapters \(the 24th and 25th\) of this work are a later addition to the text, though it is very difficult to say when this interpolation may have occurred. My own estimate is that it was not very late, and that if it can be shown to have taken place in South India, then it was very likely before the career of Rāmānuja, in other words before c. 1125 CE.29 

While it is possible that the PauṣS is also quoted by Bhagavadutpala \(SpPr 3.17: *śrīpauṣkarāyāṃ hy uktam…*\), it cannot be stated for certain that this *śrīpauṣkarā* refers to our text. Dyczkowski \(1994: 295\), however, favours this interpretation over that which puts forward the *Pauṣkarāgama*, a Śaiva work. The quoted verse is not found in the \(incomplete\) present versions of either text. Of the three works addressed here, i.e. 

the JS, SS and PauṣS, the PauṣS appears to contain the largest amount of interpolated material. Owing to the poor and incomplete state of the extant PauṣS, as reflected in Apte’s two-part \(1991, 2006\) Critical Edition, there has been very little serious scholarship on this work, and no sustained attempt to analyse and compare its heterogeneous contents.30 Moreover, unless new manuscripts of the PauṣS come to 29 The traditional date of Rāmānuja’s death, 1137 CE, is now widely regarded - see Carman \(1974: 27\) and Young \(2007: 236\) - as 30 or 40 years too early. 

[^30]: This is in contrast to the JS and the SS which, in recent years, have been the subject of, respectively, a detailed study by Rastelli \(1999\), and a partial translation by Hikita. Hikita has published separately his annotated translations of certain chapters of the SS, and several of these can be found in my bibliography. [[31]]

light, it seems unlikely that such a project could be fruitfully undertaken at any time in the near future.31 In the absence of such a text-critical study, it makes little sense in my opinion to assign the present version of the PauṣS to an early date and a North Indian provenance for, as we will see in subsequent chapters, there are several clues that significant sections of it were composed in South India at a later date.
