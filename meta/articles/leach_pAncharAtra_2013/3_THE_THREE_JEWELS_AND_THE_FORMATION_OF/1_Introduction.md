My primary focus in these first three chapters is the idea that there are three Pāñcarātra scriptures which have particular importance in the tradition. By concentrating on the formulations of this idea, I submit, we can learn something both about its origin, and about the different kinds of Pāñcarātrika who made these formulations. In Chapter One I show that this idea appears to have been much less prevalent among Pāñcarātrikas than is commonly supposed by modern Indologists. Indeed, it may well have been the case that certain members of the Pāñcarātra rejected the idea of the supremacy of these three works. As I show in Chapter Two, numerous textual sources attest to the fact that there were distinct groups within the Pāñcarātra from a time quite probably prior to the composition of the earliest extant Pāñcarātra Saṃhitās. There is, however, little consistency in the accounts of the different Pāñcarātra groups until around the late eleventh or early twelfth century. The more consistent accounts belong to works composed in South India from this date. Some of these works strongly indicate that there was, during this period, a sectarian animosity between two Pāñcarātra groups in particular, and little agreement among their opposing members as to who had the authority to perform rites in the temple. In Chapter Three, I show that this climate of sectarianism gradually went into decline, possibly starting in the thirteenth century, and that it was replaced by a culture which made concerted attempts to integrate the distinct Pāñcarātra traditions. One of the outcomes of this process was the formation of the Pāñcarātra canon.
