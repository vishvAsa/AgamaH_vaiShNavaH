title = "3 iii \\) The four Pāñcarātra Siddhāntas according to the Pādmasaṃhitā"

+++

The *Pādmasaṃhitā *\(PādS\) attempts to clearly delineate the divisions within the Pāñcarātra, while still preserving the “inclusivist” approach fostered by Yāmuna. It is one of several Saṃhitās which divides the Pāñcarātra tradition into four ‘Siddhāntas’, the others being the PauṣS \(38.293-307b\), the *Pārameśvarasaṃhitā* \(19.522-544\), the *Īśvarasaṃhitā *\(21.560-586\), the *Śrīpraśnasaṃhitā* \(16.31c-35b\), the *Bhārgavatantra* \(22.87-94b\) and, according to Vedāntadeśika, the *Hayagrīvasaṃhitā* \(see PRR 8.5-8\), the *Kālottara* \(PRR 31.14-18\), and the *Śrīkarasaṃhitā* \(PRR 30.18 *ff*\).92 Since Rastelli 90 SanS *Indrarātra* 3.81c-82: *kecit tān sāttvatān āhuḥ kecid bhāgavatān viduḥ *// *kecic ca vaiṣṇavān* *āhuḥ kecit tān pāñcarātrikān */ *iti nāmnā tu bhedena dīkṣitā vaiṣṇavāḥ smṛtāḥ *//. 

91 As outlined above, on the basis of Rastelli’s \(2003\) chronology, I place the PādS in the late twelfth or early thirteenth century at the latest. 

92 Smith \(1975: 296\) convincingly suggests that the passage in the PauṣS which deals with the Siddhāntas is part of a later interpolation. Rastelli \(2006: 190-191\) suggests that we can assign its composition and inclusion within the PauṣS to a period prior to the composition of the PārS. The 

‘ *Hayagrīvasaṃhita*’, quoted by Vedāntadeśika, is another name for the *Hayaśīrṣapañcarātra* \(Schrader 1916: 11; Gonda 1977: 106\). This work, which is not available to me, appears to have its origins in North India \(Rastelli 2007: 190\). Several scholars \(e.g. Rajan 1981: 34\) favour an early date, perhaps as early as the ninth century. However, since there is no mention of the four Pāñcarātra Siddhāntas in any other works dating from this period, or indeed from quite a lengthy period subsequent to this, we can suppose that this passage was also probably part of a later interpolation into the text. The ‘ *Kālottara*’ 

referred to by Vedāntadeśika is listed by Parampushdas and Shrutiprakashdas \(2002: 83\), under 

“Unpublished Saṃhitās”, as the ‘\(Śrī\) Kālottara-Saṃhitā’. Such a title does not appear in any 

“canonical” list given in a Saṃhitā. Each of the works listed above names the same four Pāñcarātra Siddhāntas with the exceptions of the PauṣS \(32.35b, 38.293c-294c\) which calls what is elsewhere known as ‘Āgamasiddhānta’ simply ‘Siddhānta’ and, according to Vedāntadeśika, the *Śrīkarasaṃhitā*. 

This latter work refers to the four Siddhāntas as the ‘Vedasiddhānta’, the ‘Divyasiddhānta’, the 

‘Tantrasiddhānta’, and the ‘Purāṇasiddhānta’. As far as I am aware, such a classification is not found in 69 

\(2006\) has provided a thorough description of the accounts of these Siddhāntas in the Pāñcarātra scriptural literature, I will limit myself here to a discussion of those broadly 

“sectarian” or inclusivist portrayals of the Pāñcarātra in the PādS which I believe can contribute towards our understanding of the internal divisions in the Pāñcarātra as encountered and presented by Yāmuna. 

In the opening *adhyāya* of the PādS, after a brief eulogy in which the Pañcarātra’s place among other teachings \( *śāstra*\) is likened to the place of the Ganges among other sacred bathing places \( *tīrtha*\), and of Acyuta among other gods \(PādS *jp* 1.63c-64b\), and in which there are references to the injunctions \( *vidhi*\) “of the Pañcarātra” \(1.64c, 69a\), and to the Pañcarātra as a teaching which rescues one “from the ocean of existence” \( *bhavasāgarāt*\) \(1.75-76b\), the author states the following: *ṛgādi saṃjñayā vedaś caturdhā bhidyate* * yathā* // *tadvat siddhāntabhedena* *pañcarātraṃ caturvidham* / *ṛgādayo yathā caikaṃ bhidyate bahuśākhyayā* // 

*tathā siddhāntam ekaikaṃ* *vaktṛbhedena bhidyate* /. – “Just as the Veda is divided into four parts with the names Ṛc etc., so too is the Pañcarātra fourfold, with separate Siddhāntas. And just as the Ṛc and others are divided into many branches, similarly each Siddhānta is divided by \[its having\] different speakers.” 

\(PādS *jp* 1.76c-78b\) 

Here, then, we see an apparently early attempt to present the divisions within the Pāñcarātra as being homologous with the four Vedas.93 The term *siddhānta* which ordinarily means “settled opinion or doctrine” \(Monier-Williams 2002: 1216\) is explained in the PādS by means of a process of “semantic analysis” \( *nirvacana*\): *siddhāntaṃ nāma cānvarthaṃ nirāhur iti paṇḍitāḥ* // * mīmāṃsādiṣu śāstreṣu ye* *siddhārthā manīṣiṇaḥ* / *teṣām ante ’dhikāro ’smin iti siddhāntasaṃjñitam* //. – 

“Scholars have explained the name *siddhānta* in accordance with its meaning: herein lies the authority of those learned ones who, with regard to the ultimate \( *ante*\), have accomplished \( *siddha*\) their goal in teachings such as Mīmāṃsā etc. 

94

Thus it is called *siddhānta*.” \(PādS *jp* 1.78c-79\) any other extant work. A ‘ *Śrīkara*’ is listed in the PādS \( *jp* 1.102b\), the *Viśvāmitrasaṃhitā* \(2.18d *and* 24c\), and, according to Schrader \(1916: 11\), the *Viṣṇutantra*. 

93 Vedāntadeśika would later use the same strategy in his PRR \(e.g. 3.10-12\), a text which quotes the PādS a number of times. 

94 Verse 1.79 is repeated at PādS *cp* 19.110c-111b. There are similar explanations of the term *siddhānta* in both the PauṣS \(38.305-307b\) and the PārS \(19.544\). 

70 

PādS *jp* 1.80-82 names the four Siddhāntas as ‘Mantra’, ‘Āgama’, ‘Tantra’, and 

‘Tantrāntara’. At *jp* 1.86cd, the PādS claims that it belongs to the Mantrasiddhānta. 

This Siddhānta, the author tells us elsewhere \( *cp* 19.115d\), is “foremost” \( *agrimam*\). 

Mantrasiddhāntins primarily worship a single form of god \( *ekamūrti*, *jp* 1.80ab\), which we are told \(at *cp* 21.25c\) is Vāsudeva.95 The author asserts \( *cp* 21.28c-29\) that Mantrasiddhāntins “should meditate on” or “visualise” \( *dhyāyeyuḥ*, 29c\) and honour Vāsudeva’s image \( *bera*\) with Vedic mantras \( *trayīmantra*\). The Vedic origin of the Mantrasiddhānta is described at PādS *cp* 21.2 *ff*. Here we are told that a group of 8000 

seers \( *ṛṣi*\), * * led by Aupagāyana and belonging to the Kāṇva and Mādhyandina recensions \(i.e. of the Vājasaneya school\) asked Brahmā for a means to liberation, and in response to this, Brahmā, “desiring to grant favours” \( *anugrahakāmyayā*\), initiated these seers into the Pañcarātra “by way of the * * Mantrasiddhānta” \(PādS *cp* 21.7c-8\). 

Having been initiated into the *cakravārija maṇḍala* \(also known as the *cakrābja* *maṇḍala*\), the *ṛṣi* s are instructed to recite the Kāṇvī and Mādhyandanī recensions \( *śākhā*\), and to accompany the performance of Vedic rituals such as *somayāga* with visualisation on \( *dhyāna*\) and worship of the Lord \( *bhagavat*\) \(PādS *cp* 21.10c-11b\). 

The Mantrasiddhānta, “like the Veda”, teaches that performing the ritual as a duty \( *kartavya*\), in other words as something that is “without fruit”, leads to supreme bliss.96 We are told in the following verse that this \(potentially\) liberation-conferring ritual is “the worship of the Lord \( *bhagavat*\) according to the five times teaching” 

which is “to be performed either at home or in the temple”.97 

The author of the PādS then tells us that Mantrasiddhāntins are those who are born into the lineage \( *vaṃśa*\) of Bhagavat worshippers founded by these original Vājasaneyin seers, and that it is for this reason that they are called ‘Bhāgavatas’. Once these Bhāgavatas have themselves been properly initiated, they are also qualified to 95 As Rastelli \(2006: 224-225\) shows, according to PārS 19.529-539 the Mantrasiddhāntins do not always worship god as a “single form”, they also worship him in his *vyūha* and *vibhava* forms. This is merely one example of conflicting \(“internal”/“external”\) descriptions across texts which belong to different Siddhāntas. 

96 PādS *cp* 21.11c-12: *kartavyatvena vedoktaṃ ity evaṃ phalavarjitam *// *kartavyam iti kurvāṇaiḥ*

*karma niśśreyasaṃ param */ *prāpyate ’nena yuṣmābhir mantrasiddhāntavartmanā *//. Cf. PauṣS 

36.260c-261, wherein worshipping Viṣṇu “as a duty… \[that is\] without fruit” is associated, contrarily, with the Ekāyana Brahmins \( *vipra*\). 

97 PādS *cp* 21.13ac: *pañcakālaṃ yathāśāstraṃ *\[corr. *yathāśāstra*\] *gṛhe vā mandire ’pi vā* / 

*bhagavatpūjanaṃ kāryam*… //. 

71 

perform the ritual worship of Viṣṇu in accordance with the “five times”.98 It is further stated \(at *cp* 21.17c-21b\) that only Bhāgavatas can perform worship for the sake of others \( *parārthayajana*\), though this rule is then immediately revised to enable an initiated non-Bhāgavata to do so if commanded to by a Bhāgavata.99 It is notable that the author of this section of the PādS holds ‘Bhāgavatas’ in very high regard,100 and that in equating Bhāgavatas with Mantrasiddhāntins, he is equating them with Pāñcarātrika Brahmins who also perform Vedic rites. 

This account of the Mantrasiddhānta is followed by a description of the Āgamasiddhānta. We have been told previously \(PādS *jp* 1.80cd, *cp* 19.116-117\) that members of this Siddhānta favour worshipping the four forms \( *caturmūrti*\) of god, namely the Vyūhas Vāsudeva and so on. The author of this section of the PādS clearly regards the Āgamasiddhānta as an inferior tradition, and its inferiority is conveyed by the fact that its members do not undergo initiation \( *dīkṣā*, see PādS *cp* 1.3-5b, 21.53\),101 and are therefore not qualified to perform certain rites. These include the investiture of god’s icon with the sacred thread \( *pavitrāropaṇa*\), and the rites relating to the construction of temples \( *karṣaṇādi*\) and the installation of divine images therein \( *pratiṣṭhā*\) \(PādS *cp* 21.33-35b, 43-46\). Tellingly, it is said that an Āgamasiddhāntin should ask a Brahmin who has been initiated into the Mantrasiddhānta to perform these latter rites.102 Unsurprisingly, as we will see below, Āgamasiddhāntins present a rather different picture, and claim that they *are* qualified to peform the rites relating to *pavitrāropaṇa* and *pratiṣṭhā*. 

98 PādS *cp* 21.14-15: *yūyaṃ bhāgavatās tena jātā bhagavadarcanāt* / *bhagavadbhaktikaraṇād vaṃśa-jātāś caturmukha* // *nāmnā bhāgavatāḥ santo dīkṣayitvā yathāvidhi* / *yathoktaṃ karma kurvāṇāḥ* 

*prāpnuvanti paraṃ padam* //. This understanding of the Bhāgavatas as belonging to a lineage that one is born into is also found in the *Nāradīyasaṃhita* at 11.24ab: *bhagavadvaṃśajātāḥ ye te vai bhāgavatāḥ*

*smṛtāḥ */. 

99 This immediate revision possibly indicates that the second, more moderate “rule” was incorporated into the text at a later time. 

100 See especially PādS *cp* 21.21c-22: *bhagavān eva govinda sākṣād bhāgavataḥ smṛtaḥ *// *taṃ dṛṣṭvā*

*vidyayā dīnam api duṣkṛtakāriṇam */ *nirguṇaṃ guṇinaṃ vāpi pratyuttiṣṭhet kṛtāñjaliḥ */. 

101 The PārS, which does not describe the initiation rite, also appears to confirm \(at e.g. 9.187-190, 13.114c-115, 15.14c-20, 18.116-117\) that Āgamasiddhāntins do not undergo *dīkṣā*. This information is taken from Rastelli \(2006: 193-195\). 

102 PādS *cp * 21.45: *yāceta mantrasiddhānte dīkṣitaṃ viprasattamam */ *pūjārtham ātmano* *bimbapratiṣṭhākarṣaṇādiṣu* \(corr. *karaṇādiṣu*\) //. 

72 

Both passages that discuss the omission of *dīkṣā* refer to an ‘Ekāyana’; in the first instance to an *ekāyanaṃ vedam* \(PādS *cp* 1.3c\), and in the second instance to an *ekāyanādhvan* \(PādS *cp* 21.53d\). This ‘Ekāyanaveda’ or “way of the Ekāyana” is the ritual teaching to which members of the Āgamasiddhānta adhere.103 However, despite the fact that his teaching bears the affix *veda*, according to the PādS \( *cp* 21.37c-39b\) the Pāñcarātrika ‘Ekāyana’ \(this designation is shown to be synonymous with 

‘Āgamasiddhāntin’ at PādS *cp* 21.47ab\), in contrast to the Mantrasiddhāntin is not permitted to use Vedic mantras, and recites the *dvādaśākṣara* mantra without the elements *bīja*, *śakti*, *aṅga*, *ṛṣi* and *chandas*.104 Further manifestly non-Vedic characteristics of this Siddhānta include the fact that its followers are not members of a Brahminical lineage \( *gotra*, PādS *cp* 21.41ab\), and that the “leading rite” or the “rite of guidance” \( *nayakarman*\) undertaken according to the *ekādhvan* is enjoined for all four *varṇas*, rather than only for the highest three \(PādS *cp* 21.36c-37b\). It is not clear what this *nayakarman* refers to, though it appears to be one of the life-cycle rites \( *saṃskāra*\) undertaken by Ekāyanas since it is mentioned in that context.105 

In spite of the clear deficiencies or limitations of the Ekāyana in the eyes of the more Veda-congruent Mantrasiddhāntin author of this section of the PādS, however, it is important to recognise that the followers of this “lesser” Siddhānta, and equally the followers of the other Siddhāntas, the Tantra and Tantrāntara, are accepted nonetheless as genuine Pāñcarātrikas. The Tantrasiddhānta is described in the PādS as having several characteristics in common with the Āgamasiddhānta. For instance, it accepts members of all four social classes \(PādS *cp* 21.55\), and its adherents are said to have abandoned the Veda, and to perform the life-cycle rites \( *saṃskāra*\) in accordance with their own Tantra \(PādS *cp* 21.56\). Tantrasiddhāntins are said to 103 PādS *cp* 21.36cd \(→ BhT 24.19cd\) refers to *ekādhvan* as the tradition according to which the *saṃskāras* are performed in the Āgamasiddhānta. It seems reasonable, in light of line 53cd referred to above, to take this as a synonym for *ekāyanādhvan*. At PādS *cp* 21.47ab it is stated: *ekāyanaś* *caturmūrtiṃ pratigṛhya samarcayet* /. – “The Ekāyana should worship having accepted the fourfold form”. 

104 See the parallel verses at BhT 24.20, 26c-27b\). As Hanneder \(1997\) and Rastelli \(2006\) have shown, these last two elements serve to make Tantric mantras seem more Vedic. The Mantrasiddhānta as presented in the Pāds incorporate these elements, whereas the Āgamasiddhānta does not. Rastelli \(2006: 208\) writes, “Es paßt sehr gut zu der PādS, deren Anhänger sich selbst auf vedisch-orthodoxe Traditionen zurückführen und die ihr Ritual als viṣṇuitische Modifikation des vedisch-orthodoxen Rituals betrachten, daß sie die “vedischen” und die “tantrischen” Elemente eines Mantra lehrt.” 

105 See the discussion of this verse in Rastelli \(2006: 196-197\). 

73 

worship nine forms of god \(PādS *cp* 21.59-66\). Members of the Tantrāntarasiddhānta, meanwhile, may also belong to any of the four social classes, and are said to worship images of god with three, four or more faces, surrounded by attendant deities \( *parivāra*\), and to perform the life-cycle rites in accordance with the Tantrāntara path \( *mārga*\) *and* the Veda \(PādS *cp* 21.70-73b\). 

The four Siddhāntas, then, are accepted by the PādS as distinct branches of a single tradition. Consequently the many eulogies to the ‘Pañcarātra’ in general which are found throughout this work are not intended to honour merely the Mantrasiddhānta, rather they honour all four Siddhāntas together as the aggregate 

‘Pañcarātra’. And, while, for instance, the Āgamasiddhāntin or Ekāyana is depicted as being prohibited from performing certain rites, he is nonetheless shown to perform the quintessentially Pāñcarātrika rite of worshipping Viṣṇu in accordance with the five times \( *pañcakāla*\).106 Elsewhere in the PādS, we encounter the following emphatically inclusive statement: 

*sūriḥ suhṛd bhāgavataḥ sāttvataḥ pañcakālavit* // *aikāntikas tanmayaś ca* *pāñcarātrika ity api* / *evamādibhir ākhyābhir ākhyeyaḥ kamalāsana* //. - “Sage, friend, Bhāgavata, Sāttvata, knower of the five times, Aikāntika, Tanmaya and also Pāñcarātrika - \[he\] is called by names such as these, O Kamalāsana.” \(PādS 

*cp* 2.87c-88\)107 

It is unlikely that the author of this verse is the same as the author of the descriptions of the Mantra and Āgama Siddhāntas summarised above, for there the designation ‘Bhāgavata’ clearly refers only to a follower of the Mantrasiddhānta, and not to Pāñcarātrikas in general. The inclusivism conveyed in this verse may indicate its later composition for, as we will see below, such strategies are increasingly evident among the later scriptural works. This verse is of interest here because it includes the terms ‘Aikāntika’ and ‘Tanmaya’ as synonyms of ‘Bhāgavata’ and ‘Pāñcarātrika’. The term *aikāntika* is derived from the word *ekānta* which, along with its derivatives, is prominent in the *Nārāyaṇīya* and throughout much of the Pāñcarātra scriptural 106 See PādS *cp* 21.34c-35b, and also the following verse 35c-36b: *nirāśaiḥ* *karmasaṃnyāsakāribhir* *devapūjanam* // * balādimantrair acchidrapañcakālaparāyaṇaiḥ* /. 

107 Cf. *Viśvāmitrasaṃhitā* 9.89c-90: *sa eva brāhmaṇo vidvān sa evāśramiṇāṃ varaḥ *// *sa etair* *nāmabhir vācya ekāntī pāñcarātrikaḥ */ *sūrir bhāgavataś caiva sāttvataḥ pāñcakālikaḥ *//. 

74 

literature \(see Matsubara 1994: 51-59\). Scholars have long considered one such derivative, *ekāntin*, to mean something like “monotheist” in a Pāñcarātra context \(e.g. 

ibid., and Gonda 1977\) but, as we will see below, this term can also designate “one who has a single goal” viz. liberation. That the term *aikāntika* can similarly denote 

“liberation as the single goal” is indicated in the *Ahirbudhnyasaṃhitā* \(5.22-23b\), wherein the “Aikāntika path” \( *aikāntikaṃ* *mārgam*\) is said to lead to “the fruit” 

\( *phalam*\) of attaining to the Bhagavat \( *bhagavatprāpti*\). Although the PādS \( *cp* 21.11c-12\) claims that the way of the Mantrasiddhānta leads to “ultimate bliss” 

\( *niśśreyasam*\) and that its worship of god is “without \[worldly\] fruit” \( *phalavarjitam*\), the characteristic of having liberation as the only goal is far more commonly associated with the Āgamasiddhānta or Ekāyana tradition. This is attested to in the ĀP 

\(170.3 *ff*\), the PādS \( *cp* 21.35cd, 42\), the PārS \(10.145cd\), the *Hayaśīrṣapañcarātra* \(HP\) as quoted by Vedāntadeśika \(PRR 8.5-8\), and also the PRR \(9.13-10.2\) itself. 

In other words, the reference to ‘Aikāntika’ in the passage quoted above \(PādS 

*cp* 2.87c-88\) very likely denotes a follower of the Ekāyana tradition. Moreover, we can assume that ‘Tanmaya’ is also used to denote a follower of this tradition, since elsewhere in the PādS’s Caryāpāda the Tanmayas are instructed to recite mantras belonging to the Ekāyana recension \( *śākhā*\), while the “most excellent knowers of mantras” recite from the four Vedas.108 The designation ‘Tanmaya’, meaning literally 

“\[he who is\] identical with that” or “\[he who is\] consisting of that”, is also used to refer to Ekāyanas in the SS \(25.132\) and the PauṣS \(36.266b\). In this passage of the PādS, then, as in Yāmuna’s ĀP, the Ekāyana is equated with the Brahmanical 

‘Bhāgavata’. Similarly inclusivist tendencies are not infrequent in the PādS \(and may belong, as I have suggested above, to later portions of the text\). The tension between these passages and those more “sectarian” portions is resolved, in any case, through the presentation of a “fourfold” Pāñcarātra, conceived on the model of the Veda, in which all divisions and perceived hierarchies are ultimately transcended by the inclusive and uniquely Pāñcarātrika ritual act of Viṣṇu worship according to the “five times”. 

108 PādS *cp* 11.242c-243b: *dikṣu vedāṃś ca caturaḥ paṭheyur mantravittamāḥ *// *vidikṣu ekāyanāṃ*

*śākhāṃ tanmayās sumukhās tathā */.
