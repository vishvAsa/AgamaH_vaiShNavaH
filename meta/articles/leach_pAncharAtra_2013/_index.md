Kanchi's vaikuntha perumal temple was built in the eighth century. And this temple shows familiarity with Padma samhita, ahirbudhnya etc. hence, the claim that they are post Ramanuja is nonsense (though currently it follows vaikhanasa but such changes hv happened due to disturbances - Trivikrama temple of kanchi was originally vaikhanasa but now following pancaratra). Sanderson places them at 850CE which itself is unacceptable based on the evidence from kanchi. Also, the core paddhati text of padmanabhaswamy temple's tantri is Padma samhita mixed with some malayala practices. Now, padmanabhaswamy temple is mentioned by nammazhwar (thus it is more than 1200 yrs old at the very least) and there r references to the temple even in sangam literature as per some scholars. The tantri of the temple has always been the tharananelloor family as per records. Kerala mahatmyam says that they came from kanchi (where Padma samhita reigns supreme - even in varadaraja temple). So, if Padma samhita was post Ramanuja, how come the tantris of this temple have it as their core text? Indologists fail to apply logic properly
