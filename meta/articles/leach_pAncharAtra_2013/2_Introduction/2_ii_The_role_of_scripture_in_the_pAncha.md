title = "2 ii \\) The role of scripture in the Pāñcarātra Saṃhitās"

+++

Over the past quarter of a century or so, several scholarly works in the field of Indian religions \(see e.g. the contributions in Levering 1989, Timm 1992, and Patton 1994; see also Flood 1999, 2006, 2006a\) have sought to redress a perceived imbalance in the broader discipline of “religious studies” – namely, the tendency among scholars to downplay the importance of scriptural traditions within religions, and of textual [[13]] studies within the academic study of religion. This tendency had, arguably, characterised a good deal of scholarship over the previous half century, and might itself be usefully interpreted as a corrective to the well-documented overemphasis on scriptural traditions that was initiated primarily by Protestant philologists during the nineteenth century. Timm \(1992: 2\) has summarised this initial shift in focus: Stationing themselves within the discipline of the “history of religions,” scholars dissatisfied with the limitations of the “textual” approach to the study of religion shifted the primary focus onto the so-called primitive or archaic forms of religious expression, downplaying the importance of the scriptural and commentarial traditions in favor of uncovering foundational categories and motifs through which they hoped to reveal the universal patterns and qualities of human religious expression. 

This particular approach to religion as a *sui generis* phenomenon has been adopted most prominently by scholars working in the field of the “phenomenology of religion”, most notably Gerardus van der Leeuw and Mircea Eliade and their methodological heirs. However, as McCutcheon \(1997: 14 *ff*\) has observed, the Schleiermacherian prioritisation of “inner” or “subjective” religious experience over “interpersonally available” historical data \(texts, artefacts etc.\) can by no means be limited, within the study of religion, to the phenomenologists. In his book *Beyond Phenomenology: Rethinking the Study of Religion*, Flood \(1999: 47, 50\) offers a critique of the ahistorical emphasis on “inner experience” and argues instead for a historicist approach to religions, understanding the latter primarily as “value-laden” and, re Lactantius, “binding” narratives and behaviours which are “articulated in *texts*” \(my emphasis\). Elsewhere, Flood \(2006a: 52\) takes the term “religion” to refer, *par excellence*, “to forms of human practice communally arrived at which are constrained by a text or group of texts set aside and regarded as sacred.”4 Addressing Indian textual history, Flood \(2006: 49\) highlights the significance of the “Tantric” 

traditions being *scriptural*, noting that “Tantric practices are always textually substantiated”, and that in the Tantric context “text is inseparable from tradition”. 

This last idea is helpfully conveyed by the fact that in the Tantric literature, the term 

[^4]: “Religion”, writes Flood \(2006a: 52\), can be taken “to refer prototypically to a historical tradition that is formed by text and continuously refers back to that text.” [[14]]

*tantra* can mean both “text” *and* “tradition”, the latter being denoted, for instance, in the stock phrase *asmin tantre* \(see Padoux 1998\). In addition, just as the adjective 

“Vedic” \( *vaidika*\) designates first and foremost a *textual* tradition or orientation \(rather than the derived sense marking a historical period\), so too the term “Tantric” 

\( *tāntrika*\) refers to particular *texts*, to rites prescribed in these texts, and to identities constrained by them. It is notable that in the context of Tantric \(as distinct from 

“Purāṇic”\) Śaivism, as Hanneder \(1998: 5\) explains, the word *śaiva* does not denote 

“a worshipper of Śiva”, but rather one who follows a scripture that is taught by Śiva. 

Turning to the Pāñcarātra Saṃhitās, how is the role of scripture understood and articulated therein? Can a common understanding of the place and purpose of scripture be detected within this large and diverse body of literature? Is it possible, in other words, to speak of a Pāñcarātra attitude to scripture or are there, rather, a variety of attitudes, each of them peculiar to one or other text, tradition or historical period? 

First of all, it should be stated that the Pāñcarātra scriptural corpus evolved over a long period of time. Over five hundred years separate the composition of the earliest Saṃhitās at our disposal from the composition of the most recent. Accordingly, it is obviously true that when the earliest works were written, a Pāñcarātra “scriptural corpus” did not exist as it did for the authors of the youngest texts. This is also true of the earliest of the *published* Saṃhitās, namely the *Jayākhyasaṃhitā* \(JS\), the *Sātvatasaṃhitā* \(SS\) and the *Pauṣkarasaṃhitā *\(PauṣS\). In these works there are not many clues, outside of clearly interpolated material,5 to an already existing Pāñcarātra scriptural tradition.6 

In the *Jayākhyasaṃhitā* \(at 22.3a\) we find a single, passing reference to the 

“Bhagavaddharma Tantras”, mentioned alongside “those who observe the \[ritual teaching of the\] five times” and, as we will see below, there are a number of verses in this work in which the teaching \( *śāstra*\) and those who know it are praised, but these 5 I refer here to the *Adhikaḥ Pāṭhaḥ* section of the JS, and to PauṣS 38.295-39.39 \(on which see Smith 1975: 296\). 

[^6]: The *Sātvatasaṃhitā* and the *Pauṣkarasaṃhitā* both provide notable exceptions: the former with its reference to “those who are learned in the Saṃhitās” \( *saṃhitāpāragāṇām*, SS 20.4c\) – the context suggests that this must be a reference to the Pāñcarātra Saṃhitās; I discuss the relevant passage in the *Pauṣkarasaṃhitā* \(41.77-97\) below. It is also worth noting that if we discount the interpolated *Adhikaḥ*

*Pāṭhaḥ* section of the *Jayākhyasaṃhitā*, the three earliest of the published Saṃhitās contain no mention of each other. [[15]]

instances provide scant evidence of a scriptural tradition peculiar to the Pāñcarātra.7 

Indeed, it is telling that a “knower of the Śāstra” \( *śāstrajña*\) is identified in the *Jayākhyasaṃhitā * as “a Vaiṣṇava who knows the Purāṇa, the Dharmaśāstras and the Vaiṣṇava legends \( *itihāsa*\), who listens to the doctrines of the Vedānta \(i.e. the Upaniṣads\) and also explains \[their meaning\], and who, after carefully discussing the import of \[scriptural\] statements belonging to lost traditions of recitation \( *praṇaṣṭapāṭha*\)8 together with \[other\] knowers of that \[import\], tirelessly pieces together \( *saṃskaroti*\) a sacred text \( *āgama*\).”9 In this definition of a “knower of the Śāstra”, then, there is no mention of texts belonging specifically to the Pāñcarātra. 

Both the “knower of the Śāstra” and the collectively assembled “sacred text” or 

“scripture” \( *āgama*\) are located, rather, within a textual tradition that is *smārta* \(in the sense of being based upon scriptural statements which are “remembered” rather than directly “heard”\),10 and simply “Vaiṣṇava”.11 

The broadly Vaiṣṇava identity of the scriptural tradition ackowledged by the *Jayākhyasaṃhitā* is also apparent in the section which follows the identification of the **

“knower of the Śāstra”. This passage addresses the role of the *śāstradhāraka*, who is responsible for preserving and transmitting the scriptures: 

[^7]: Both the *Jayākhyasaṃhitā* \(elsewhere at 1.12 and 1.40ab\) and the *Pauṣkarasaṃhitā* \(30.38, 31.200\) refer to their own tradition, on a couple of occasions, as *Bhagavaddharma*. The verse heading at JS 

22.3 equates the *Bhagavaddharma* with the *dharma* of the Bhāgavatas, who are alternatively called 

‘Vaiṣṇava’ in the same chapter \(see 22.1, 56cd\). 

[^8]: The compound *pranaṣṭapāṭhavākyānām*, and thus the verse in which it occurs, can be interpreted differently. See e.g. Colas \(1995: 131 n. 37\): “Ayant pratiqué la conjecture du sens correct des passages dont la leçon est corrompue, avec l’aide des connaisseurs de ces \(textes\), il perfectionne l’Āgama, avec zèle et sans se lasser”. Czerniak-Drożdżowicz \(2003: 40\) gives a similar reading. 

[^9]: JS 22.51c-53: *purāṇaṃ dharmaśāstrāṇi itihāsāṃś ca vaiṣṇavān*// *vetti vedāntasiddhāntān śṛṇuyād vyākaroti api*/ *praṇaṣṭapāṭhavākyānāṃ kṛtvā vastuvicāraṇam*// *tajjñais saha prayatnād vai hy āgamaṃ saṃskaroti yaḥ*/ *atandritaḥ sadā viddhi taṃ śāstrajñam hi vaiṣṇavam*//. 

[^10]: See Pollock’s \(1997: 408\) summary of the *śruti*/ *smṛti * distinction in “classical Sanskrit culture”: “In short, *śruti * means nothing other than “\(Veda\) actually now perceived aurally \(in recitation\)”, i.e. extant or available; *smṛti*, nothing other than “\(Veda\) that is remembered”, i.e., material that, having once been heard in recitation is inferentially recoverable from present reformulations \(in language or practice\), which once existed as part of a Vedic corpus.” Pollock \(ibid.: 409\) goes on to explain: “Early Mīmāṃsā \[as articulated in the *Śābarabhāṣya* and the *Tantravārttika*\] holds that the *smṛti* s are derived from Vedic recensions now forgotten or geographically or otherwise inaccessible to us; Nyāya \[as articulated, for example, in Udayana’s *Nyāyakusumāñjali*\] reasons that these recensions must have actually disappeared”. On the basis of this description, it would appear that the *Jayākhyasaṃhitā*’s conception of “lost traditions of recitation” \( *praṇaṣṭapāṭha*\) corresponds more closely to the Naiyāyika account. 

[^11]: The “knower of the *śāstra*” \( *śāstrajñaḥ*\) is also identified simply as a “Vaiṣṇava” at JS 1.58. [[16]]

*śraddhayā yaḥ samuccitya yatra kutracid āgamam* / *brahma dhyāyaṃs tathā* 

*paścāt sandhārayati yatnataḥ* // *pūjayaty arghyapuṣpādyaiś śāstrapīṭhaṃ* 

*krameṇa tu* / *dadāti vaiṣṇavānāṃ ca gopayaty akṛtātmanām* // 

*anyadarśanabhaktānāṃ viddhi taṃ śāstradhārakam* /. – “Know that a *śāstradhāraka* is one who, having faithfully assembled the scripture \( *āgama*\) wherever it is \[diversely found\], then carefully retains it in his memory, \[all the while\] meditating on *brahman*, and who worships the *śastrapīṭha* in the appropriate way with *arghya* and flowers etc., and who imparts \[the scripture\] to Vaiṣṇavas, and conceals it from the unprepared devotees of other systems \( *darśana*\).” \(JS 22.54-56b\) 

The idea that Vaiṣṇavas belong to the same “system”, or share a common “point of view” \( *darśana*, on this term see Halbfass 1988: 263-286\) is echoed also in the *Sātvatasaṃhitā* \(22.26-27b\). According to the 22nd chapter of the *Jayākhyasaṃhitā*, in which both of the above quoted passages are found, Vaiṣṇavas are born into a “great lineage” \( *mahākula*, JS 22.4d\) whose members are devoted exclusively to the Bhāgavata *dharma* and who, as mentioned above, observe the ritual teaching of the 

“five times” \( *pañcakāla*\) and follow the Bhagavaddharma Tantras \(JS 22.3\). It is notable that the devotees of Viṣṇu who adhere to the ritual system set forth in the *Jayākhyasaṃhitā* are most commonly referred to as *vaiṣṇava*, rather than as *pāñcarātrika*. Indeed, if we discount the colophons and the interpolated *Adhikaḥ* 

*Pāṭhaḥ* section, it is striking how infrequently the terms *pañcarātra* and *pāñcarātrika* occur in the *Jayākhyasaṃhitā*. As we will see repeatedly below, this is in stark contrast to the later Saṃhitās, especially those composed in South India, and it suggests that in the time and place of the composition of the *Jayākhyasaṃhitā*, the distinctions between Pāñcarātrikas and other Vaiṣṇavas were less clear than they would later become.12 We might bear this in mind when we consider the idea of 

“scripture” \( *āgama*\) or Śāstra in Pāñcarātra texts of this earlier period. 

The passage describing the *śāstradhāraka * is also of particular interest in the present context on account of its reference to the worship of the “seat” of Śāstras \( *śāstrapīṭha*\). It is noteworthy that several Pāñcarātra works, including the *Jayākhyasaṃhitā*, the *Sātvatasaṃhitā* and the *Pauṣkarasaṃhitā*, refer to the worship of texts in their written form, whether collectively, as part of a *śāstrapīṭha*, or 12 The *Sātvatasaṃhitā*, the *Pauṣkarasaṃhitā* and the *Paramasaṃhitā* \(ParS\) also address themselves primarily to “Vaiṣṇavas” rather than to Pāñcarātrikas. See e.g. SS 12.170, 16.10, 19.2, 21.46ab; PauṣS 

20.111, 27.128ab, 31.212, 36.256; ParS 3.52-56, 5.74, 7.1-26, 16.2, 57-8, 19.48, 26.76, 29.33. [[17]]

otherwise.13 The *śāstrapīṭha* mentioned here is the same as the *vidyāpīṭha*, the “seat of knowledge”, or in Brunner-Lachaux’s \(1963: 226 n. 2\) words the “throne of wisdom” 

\( *trône-de-sagesse*\), that is met with quite frequently in Śaiva literature.14 Indeed both the *Jayākhyasaṃhitā* \(21.23cd\) and the *Pauṣkarasaṃhitā* \(41.91, 97cd\) refer to it also as the *vidyāpīṭha*. Of these two works, the *Pauṣkarasaṃhitā* \(at 41.77-97\) contains the much fuller description of the *śāstrapīṭha*, and includes information on the texts that are to be worshipped there. In this account, the “entire collection of Pañcarātra 

\[teachings\], beginning with the Sadāgama” \(I discuss the notion *sadāgama* below in Chapter Five\) is included alongside the Vedas and their auxiliary “limbs” \( *vedāṅga*\), the Smṛtis and other “remembered” works \( *smṛtyantara*\), the Itihāsas, and works on philosophy and grammar.15 These texts are tied together with cord and placed in caskets on a metal yantra in a whitewashed stone sanctuary that is decorated with a portrait of the goddess Vāgīśvarī holding a bundle of Śāstras \(PauṣS 41.80c-84\). The adept then worships the manuscripts \( *pustaka*\) which are collectively called Viṣṇu’s 

“body of pure knowledge” \( *viśuddhajñānadeha*, PauṣS 41.88\). The text says that Viṣṇu is to be worshipped in the form of the Vedas and Upaniṣads adorned with the Sadāgama etc. \(i.e. the Pāñcarātra scriptures\) and the divine Purāṇas etc. 

\( *bhagavatpurāṇādya*, PauṣS 41.90\). This seat of Śāstras \( *śāstrapīṭha*\), or knowledge \( *vidyāpīṭha*\), is “made of the word- *brahman*” \( *śabdabrahmamayam*\), and it should be worshipped daily \(PauṣS 41.91\). 

As is indicated by the inclusion of works of philosophy and grammar, in this description of the *śāstrapīṭha* the term *śāstra * has a broader designation than 

“scripture” as is ordinarily understood. In the Pāñcarātra literature, the term *śāstra* is 13 As well as mentioning the *śāstrapīṭha* \(SS 25.377a\), the *Sātvatasaṃhitā* also contains the injunction that “the teaching relating to the highest lord is not to be opened without being worshipped” \( *nāpujitaṃ*

*samudghāṭyaṃ śāsanaṃ pārameśvaram*, SS 21.16ab\). See also the precept for worshipping the “pure” 

and “divine” collection of scriptures \( *āgamasaṃcaya*\) at SS 20.13-14b. Elsewhere in the scriptural corpus, the worship of texts in their written form is prescribed, for example, in the *Viṣvaksenasaṃhitā* 

\(37.14c *ff*\), the *Pārameśvarasaṃhitā* \(12.149c-150b\) and the *Īśvarasaṃhitā* \(14.225c *ff*\). 

[^14]: See for example Aghoraśivācārya’s *Kriyākramadyotikā * p.119-120 – information from Brunner-Lachaux \(1963: 226-227\) – the *Tantrāloka* \(28.156b\), and the *Yogakhaṇḍa * of the * Manthānabhairava-tantra* \(folio 86a\) – information from Dyczkowski \(1988: 158 n. 280\). Dyczkowski writes here: 

“*Vidyāpīṭha * in the \[Śaiva\] Siddhānta refers to the Āgama in general viewed as an object of veneration. 

The worship of the sacred scripture is a way of worshipping Śiva.” 

[^15]: PauṣS 41.78-79: *pariśuddhān samuccitya pañcarātrīyasañcayān*/ *sadāgamādikān kṛtsnān vedavedāṅgasaṃyutān*// *smṛtismṛtyantaropetān itihāsasamanvitān*/ *ānvīkṣakībhir vidyābhis saśabdākhyābhisaṃvṛtān*//. [[18]]

broadly used to denote any teaching which imparts sacred knowledge, which is to say knowledge that is ultimately derived from god. Of course this includes the Saṃhitās, which frequently refer to themselves as *śāstra*,16 but it is not limited to them. Thus, it is commonly said that the Pāñcarātrika preceptor, i.e. the *guru* or *ācārya*,17 whose duty it is to reveal the Śāstra to other initiates \(see e.g. JS 18.69-70, SS 22.15c-16b, *Īśvarasaṃhitā* 22.38 *ff*\), must be learned in other teachings in addition to the Saṃhitās.18 For this reason, in the following when I translate *śāstra* I do so with the word “teaching”, and I reserve the term “scripture” for the Sanskrit *āgama* which, as mentioned above, refers more narrowly to the Pāñcarātra scriptural corpus or to a particular text within it. 

Insofar as the worship of manuscripts does not appear to be confined to one particular Pāñcarātra tradition, to one category of Pāñcarātrika initiate,19 or to one historical period, this practice provides a good indication of the central importance of texts in the religious lives of Pāñcarātrikas. This is also attested to by the prescriptions for the practice of textual study \( *svādhyāya*, *adhyayana*\), which we find throughout the literature. Listening to, contemplating \( *cintana*\), reciting, and expounding upon \( *vyākhyāna*\) texts is enjoined for all initiates \(see e.g. JS 16.301-314b, SS 21.8\). In the *Pauṣkarasaṃhitā* \(41.61cd\), some of the texts to be studied are named – the *Ṛgveda*, *Sāmaveda* and Itihāsa. In later works, such as the *Pādmasaṃhitā* \( *cp* 13.66c-72b\) and the *Śrīpraśnasaṃhitā* \(17.55-57b\), other texts are added to this list: the Purāṇas, the Dharmaśāstras, and texts of the Pāñcarātra. 

[^16]: See e.g. JS 18.69-70, 33.86ab, SS 21.42, *Śrīpraśnasaṃhitā* 54.135ab, *Īśvarasaṃhitā * 25.217. 

[^17]: Gonda \(1965: 240\) has shown that the term *guru* has had, from the time of “the earliest texts” a much broader semantic range than has *ācārya*, primarily insofar as it has not always exclusively denoted a 

“spiritual teacher” but has also been applied to “other venerable or respectable persons, to father, mother, or any relative older than one’s self.” However, in the Pāñcarātra Saṃhitās the terms *guru* and *ācārya* are usually synonymous \(see e.g. JS 16.329, SS 20.2-3, *Ahirbudhnyasaṃhitā* 15.44-45, *Lakṣmītantra* 21.41. For exceptions, see e.g. JS 20.139c-140b, and *Sanatkumārasaṃhitā Brahmarātra* 5.14c-30b\). In keeping with its traditionally more specific denotation, *ācārya* is usually the term used when the fourfold hierarchy of Pāñcarātrika initiates is enumerated i.e. the series *samayin*, *putraka*, *sādhaka* and *ācārya*, though the terms *guru* and *deśika * are also occasionally applied to this role \(e.g. JS 

16.329, PauṣS 33.24, SS 20.2-3, 22.61c\). 

[^18]: These normally include the Vedas and their auxiliary limbs \( *vedāṅga*\), and the Upaniṣads \( *vedānta*\). 

See e.g. *Ahirbudhnyasaṃhitā * 20.1 *ff*, *Śrīpraśnasaṃhitā * 16.1-12, *Viśvāmitrasaṃhitā* 3.2-6. 

[^19]: On occasion, the worship of texts is prescribed for a particular category of initiate \(e.g. for the *putraka* at SS 20.13-14, or for the *sādhaka * at JS 17.33c-34 and *Viṣvaksenasaṃhitā* 37.4c-15b\), but elsewhere it is enjoined for the initiate in more general terms \(e.g. SS 21.16ab, 25.377, and PauṣS 

41.77 *ff*\). [[19]]

The centrality of the study of texts for Pāñcarātrikas is most clearly conveyed by the fact that this practice was enshrined in the daily routine of initiates known as the “five times” \( *pañcakāla*\). This consists of the performance of the following five ritual duties at five different times of the day: i.\) “approaching” god \( *abhigamana*\) by means of mantra-repetition \( *japa*\) and the singing of hymns of praise \( *stotra*\). This is to be peformed before sunrise, during the period known as *brahmamuhūrta*; ii.\) Having arisen, the next period of the day \(lasting one *prahara*, approximately three hours\) is to be spent gathering the materials \(such as flowers, fruits etc.\) for worship. 

This duty is called *upādāna* \(“acquiring” or “appropriating”\); iii.\) Then, worship of god \( *ijyā*\) is to be performed, for about four and a half hours according to the *Jayākhyasaṃhitā* \(22.71c\); iv.\) This is followed by the study of texts \( *svādhyāya*\), which consists of listening to a recital, contemplating its meaning, and then reciting and expounding upon the text oneself. According to the *Pauṣkarasaṃhitā*, this lasts a further three hours \(or one *prahara*\); v.\) Finally, at the end of the day, one should perform *pūjā* and follow this with meditation \( *yoga*\), which should then continue intermittently through the night. This description of the five duties at five times is a summary of passages in the *Jayākhyasaṃhitā* \(22.64c-74b\) and the *Pauṣkarasaṃhitā* 

\(38.283-292\), which offer very similar accounts. As Rastelli \(2000a, 2006: 86-91\) has shown, although neither of these texts nor the *Sātvatasaṃhitā* place particular emphasis on this fivefold schema, and do not prescribe its performance for all initiates, in many of the later Saṃhitās, and in other works which describe Pāñcarātra rituals, the performance of these rites at the “five times” is shown to be incumbent upon *all* Pāñcarātrikas. 

Thus, the study of texts, including those other than the Pāñcarātra Saṃhitās, became a daily duty for initiates. As we have seen above, Pāñcarātrikas were also enjoined to worship texts other than their own scriptures. How, then, do the Saṃhitās distinguish themselves from these other texts? As we will see repeatedly below, one of the most common ways in which the Pāñcarātra scriptures are distinguished from other Śāstras is that they alone are capable of conferring liberation from worldy suffering. The importance that the Saṃhitās accord themselves in the lives of initiates \( *śiṣya*\) is also evident from the passages, often found at the very end of a work, that 20 

enumerate the merits which accrue from hearing the teaching \( *śravaṇaphala * or *phalaśruti*\). A few examples will suffice: “Should one who is a Vaiṣṇava of pure mind hear this Tantra, the sins he committed in former lifetimes will vanish… A man who dilligently reads this \[Tantra\], or who teaches it \[to another\], his sin perishes and 

\[his\] devotion is regarded as exceptional.”20 “This Tantra bestows longevity and health, and increases fame, beauty and wealth. It destroys sins and is assuredly the means to *yoga*.”21 “God is pleased with he who reads this \[Tantra\] with devotion. 

Liberation is in the palm of his hand, and he is freed from his sins.”22 According to the *Jayākhyasaṃhitā* \(1.57cd\), the two goals of the initiate, namely liberation from *saṃsāra* \( *mokṣa*\) and worldly “enjoyments” \( *bhoga*\), are both “dependent upon Śāstra” \( *śāstrāyattā*\). 

The Saṃhitās are accessible only to those who have undergone the ritual of initiation \( *dīkṣā*\) into the Pāñcarātra \(see e.g. JS 33.86ab, SS 21.42\), though not all texts agree upon whether all initiates are authorised to access them. Thus, the *Sātvatasaṃhitā* \(22.15c-16\) states that the lowest rank of initiate, the follower of the general observances \( *samayin*\), is eligible to learn the Śāstra from the preceptor \( *deśika*\), and to deliberate upon \( *vicārayati*\) its meaning, while the *Sanatkumārasaṃhitā *\( *Brahmarātra * 5.120cd\) describes Samayins as “not knowing the Tantras” \( *atantrajñā*\).23 Nonetheless, the fact that initiation is required to access these texts distinguishes them from the other Śāstras mentioned above, which Pāñcarātrikas also study and worship. As we will see below, especially in Chapter Four, the Pāñcarātra Saṃhitās commonly present themselves, like the Śaiva Tantras \(see 20 *Paramasaṃhitā * 31.66, 68: *ya idaṃ śruṇuyāt tantraṃ vaiṣṇavaḥ śuddhamānasaḥ*/ *tasya pāpāni naśyanti janmāntarakṛtāni ca*// … // *yaḥ paṭhed ādarād etat tat pāṭhayati vā naraḥ*/ *tasyāpi pāpaṃ kṣarati viśeṣā bhaktir iṣyate*//. 

[^21]: *Viṣvaksenasaṃhitā* 8.7: *āyur ārogyadaṃ nṝṇāṃ kīrtiśrīpuṣṭivardhanam *\(corr. *kīrtiśrīputra-vardhanam*\*\) **/ *pāpakṣayaṃ mahāpuṇyaṃ yogasādhanam eva ca*//. \* This correction is suggested by the editor. 

[^22]: *Bhārgavatantra* 25.26c-27b: *etad yaḥ paṭhate bhaktyā tasmin devaḥ prasīdati*// *tasya muktiḥ*

*karatale sa pāpebhyaḥ pramucyate*/. 

[^23]: The fourfold hierarchy of initiates \( *samayin*, *putraka*, *sādhaka*, *ācārya*\) which is found in some but not all Pāñcarātra works, has been addressed by several scholars \(e.g. Gupta 1983, Rastelli 2000, 2000a\). Very often the descriptions of these categories of initiate in one text will conflict with those found in another. The classification is itself neither unique nor original to the Pāñcarātra, and is found more commonly in the Śaiva Tantras. [[21]]

Sanderson 1988\), as transmitting a higher, more specialised revelation for those who are already initiated into the Veda. 

The ritual of initiation is led by the *ācārya* or *guru*, who uses a Saṃhitā as his guide. The initiate appears to have a special relationship with the text by which he joins the community of practitioners – according to the *Jayākhyasaṃhitā* \(16.301\), this is his “own Śāstra”, and he should protect it as if it were his own body \( *gopanīyaṃ svaśāstraṃ ca rakṣaṇīyaṃ śarīravat*, JS 16.301cd\). The *Sātvatasaṃhitā* 

\(17.138\) also recommends that one worships and protects \( *gopana*\) the scripture \( *āgama*\) by which one has commenced one’s religious practice. However, as Rastelli \(1999: 31\) has pointed out, the majority of the *Jayākhyasaṃhitā*, for instance, appears to be addressed primarily to the preceptor, with several chapters also clearly intended for the *sādhaka*, the category of initiate beneath the *ācārya*. Although it is not expressly stated, it may have been the case that only certain parts of this and other Saṃhitās were accessible to the other initiates.24 To be sure, the bulk of these texts have the function of manuals which are intended to guide the preceptor through the officiation of rituals. So far as the *other* participants in the ritual are concerned, it is the preceptor, rather than the text, which acts as the guide. Hence, in the context of the ritual, the *guru* or *ācārya* is truly the one who reveals the scripture, and in this sense he is akin to god \(see e.g. JS 5.8d, 16.363, SS 17.128ab, 18.121cd, PauṣS 32.69, 33.24, *Lakṣmītantra * 21.41d, 23.4cd\), and should be worshipped as god is worshipped \(JS 21.76cd, SS 8.96cd, 20.33-34b, 40, PauṣS 30.213ab\). In fact, according to the *Jayākhyasaṃhitā*, the guru is more important than both the Śāstra and god: *vibhoḥ śāstrasya ca guros tritayasyāsya pūjanāt*// *phalaṃ bhavaty anūnaṃ vai* *iha loke paratra ca*/ *nārāyaṇaḥ paraṃ brahma tajjñānenābhigamyate*// 

*jñānasya sādhanaṃ śāstraṃ tac chāstraṃ guruvaktragam*/ *brahmaprāptir ato* *hetor gurvadhīnā sadaiva hi*// *hetunā ’nena vai viprā gurur gurutamaḥ smṛtaḥ*

/ *yasmād devo jagannāthaḥ kṛtvā martyamayīṃ tanum*// *magnān uddharate* *lokān kāruṇyāc chāstrapāṇinā*/ *tasmād bhaktir gurau kāryā*

*saṃsārabhayabhīruṇā*// *śāstrāñjanena yo ’jñānatimiraṃ vinipātayet*/ *śāstraṃ*

*pāpaharaṃ puṇyaṃ pavitraṃ bhogamokṣadam*// *śāntidaṃ ca mahārthaṃ ca* *vakti yas sa jagadguruḥ*/. – “From the worship of this triad of Lord, Śāstra and 24 Since some texts, as I have mentioned above, clearly grant other initiates access to the scriptures – for instance the *Sātvatasaṃhitā* calls the *putraka* a knower of the Śāstra \( *śāstrajña*\) – this issue appears to be one on which we cannot reach general conclusions. [[22]]

guru, the entire fruit comes into being both in this world and in the next life. 

Nārāyaṇa, the supreme *brahman*, is attained with this knowledge. Śāstra is the means of accomplishing this knowledge, and Śāstra is in the mouth of the guru. 

Hence, attainment of *brahman* is always dependent upon the guru as the cause, and on account of this, O Brahmins, the guru is considered to be the most important \[of the triad\]. Because God, the lord of the universe, after making a mortal body \[for himself\] out of compassion, lifts up people who are immersed 

\[in the ocean of *saṃsāra*\] with the hand of scripture, therefore devotion to the guru should be performed with fear and dread of *saṃsāra*. One who can dispel the darkness of ignorance with the ointment of the teaching, who proclaims the teaching that removes evil, and is meritorious, purifying, and granting of enjoyments and liberation, which bestows tranquility and is the highest teaching \( *mahārtham*\), he is a world-teacher \( *jagadguru*\).” \(JS 1.60c-66b\) A similar hierarchy is present in the *Sanatkumārasaṃhitā* \(SanS\).25 

We can conclude this short survey by noting that there are, then, a number of quite general statements that can reasonably be made concerning the role of scripture in the Pāñcarātra Saṃhitās. Pāñcarātrikas routinely worshipped the manuscripts of their own scriptures as well as other texts, while the practice of textual study \( *svādhyāya*\) became a daily duty incumbent upon all initiates. Initiation into the Pāñcarātra granted access to at least sections of the scriptural corpus, and Pāñcarātrikas were exhorted by the authors of the Saṃhitās to safeguard the text with which their own initiation was conducted. Large parts of the Saṃhitās are clearly intended to guide the preceptor through his officiation of rituals, and would thus be accessible to the other initiates through his mediation. Insofar as the preceptor is responsible for revealing these parts of the Saṃhitās to the other initiates, his role is akin to that of god, through whom the revelation of scripture first took place. Certain textual passages praise the guru above both scripture and god on the basis that without 25 SanS *Brahmarātra* 10.51-54: *laukikaṃ vaidikaṃ cāpi tathādhyātmikam eva ca*/ *trividhaṃ tat* *samuddiṣṭaṃ pradhānaṃ cottarottaram*// *laukikaṃ tv arthaśāstrādi vaidikaṃ vedasaṃyutam*/ 

*adhyātmajñānam anyac ca yogatantrādi kathyate*// *yogatantreṣu sarveṣu viṣṇutantram anuttamam*/ 

*viṣṇutantreṣu sarveṣu pañcarātraṃ viśiṣyate*// *pañcarātre tathā mantrā mantreṣv artho viśiṣyate*/ 

*artheṣv apy upadeśaś ca nopadeśāt paraṃ tataḥ*//. – “That \[knowledge, *vidyā*\] is threefold and is, in ascending order of importance, worldly, Vedic, and relating to the Self. ‘Worldly’ knowledge \[is imparted in\] the Arthaśāstra and so on, ‘Vedic’ knowledge is connected with the Vedas, and knowledge of the Self is discussed in such works as the Yoga Tantras. Among all Yoga Tantras, the Viṣṇu Tantra is supreme. The Pañcarātra is best among all Viṣṇu Tantras, and in the Pañcarātra it is the mantras \[that are most important\]. With regard to the mantras, the referent \[i.e. the deity\] is most important, and with regard to the referents, instruction \[i.e. from a guru, is the most important element\]. 

Thus, there is nothing higher than instruction.” [[23]]

him, scripture, and therefore god, would remain inaccessible to the ordinary initiate. 

However, it is to be noted that this hierarchy is authorative precisely because it is substantiated by scripture. 

My reason for emphasising here the importance of scripture, and of texts generally, in the religious lives of Pāñcarātrikas is as follows. In this thesis I argue that from the study of these texts we can learn a great deal about the identities of those who authored and used them. The fact that the religious practices of Pāñcarātrikas are, to recall Flood’s words, “textually substantiated”, allows us to track the changes that the ritual repertoire of one particular Pāñcarātra tradition, or text, underwent. Such changes can teach us something about the traditions that used these texts. Not only this, Pāñcarātrika identities were established alongside the classification of Pāñcarātra texts, and their appeals to texts outside of the Pāñcarātra corpus. As I will show in the following, the most prominent division between separate Pāñcarātra traditions was demarcated precisely by their textual allegiance. Moreover, the subsequent emergence of a single, integrated Pāñcarātrika identity was fashioned alongside the Pāñcarātra scriptural canon.
