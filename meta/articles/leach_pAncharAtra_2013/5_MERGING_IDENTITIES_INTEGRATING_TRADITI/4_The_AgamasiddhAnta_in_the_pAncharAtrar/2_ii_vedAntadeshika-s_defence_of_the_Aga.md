title = "2 ii \\) Vedāntadeśika’s defence of the Āgamasiddhānta"

+++

While the PārS and the *Kōyiloḷuku*, the Śrīraṅgam temple chronicle, provide ample evidence \(see Rastelli 2006: 243-244\) that the Ekāyanas were active in Śrīraṅgam in the 12th and \(probably early\) 13th centuries, there is not, to my knowledge, a comparable body of evidence which can demonstrate that they remained active there as late as the early fourteenth century i.e. when Vedāntadeśika composed the PRR 

and was *ācārya* at the Raṅganāthasvāmin temple. However, the PRR itself contains several passages which suggest that this very probably *was* the case. For it is difficult to overlook the fact that in his defence of the Pāñcarātra, Vedāntadeśika lends his support in particular to the Āgamasiddhānta. Thus, in the opening section of the PRR’s first chapter, Vedāntadeśika establishes that the Āgamasiddhānta is the 231 

primary Siddhānta. In support of this he quotes \(at PRR 6.4 *ff*\) PauṣS 38.293c-305, and \(at 8.5-8\) the *Hayagrīvasaṃhitā *\(otherwise known as the *Hayaśīrṣapañcarātra*\), both of which list the Āgamasiddhānta at the top of the Siddhānta hierarchy. 

Subsequently, at PRR 9.8-11, he quotes PādS *cp* 19.111c-113b, which lists the Mantrasiddhānta as the “first” Siddhānta, but in his succeeding commentary, Vedāntadeśika notes that this is a reversal of the sequence \( *vyutkrama*\) that is found in the PauṣS, and that this reversal is intended merely as a means of praising the Mantrasiddhānta.377 In other words, the hierarchy found in the PauṣS is the canonical one. As if to emphasise this, Vedāntadeśika then \(falsely\!\) claims, at PRR 9.13-14, that the PādS itself acknowledges the “superiority” \( *atiśayaḥ*\) of the Āgamasiddhānta, and that this superiority is conveyed, according to the PādS, by the fact that the Āgamasiddhānta confers liberation alone. 

These verses in the PRR are followed by a short quotation of PādS * cp* 19.117ab: “And in the Āgama \[Siddhānta\], wherein the renunciation of actions is described…” \( *karmaṇām api saṃnyāsaḥ kathyate yatra cāgame*\). Vedāntadeśika quotes this half- *śloka* in order to issue an important corrective as to its meaning. The 

“renunciation of actions” mentioned here refers, in fact, to the renunciation of 

“actions motivated by desire” \( *kāmyakarma*\) which is performed in the Āgamasiddhānta, says Vedāntadeśika, in accordance with the teaching of “pure renunciation” \( *sāttvikatyāga*\) that is propounded in the 18th chapter of the *Bhagavadgītā*.378 In other words, according to Vedāntadeśika, Āgamasiddhāntins perform rituals relating to their own social class and stage of life etc. 

\( *svavarṇāśramādi*\), and also the daily and occasional rites prescribed in the Gṛhyasūtras of their own *śākhā*, but they renounce what the *Bhagavadgītā * calls the 

“fruits” of these actions.379 “Therefore”, concludes Vedāntadeśika, “it should not be 377 PRR 9.12-13: *atra āgamamantrasiddhāntayoḥ pauṣkaroktakramāt vyutkrameṇopādānaṃ*

*siddhimokṣapradamantrasiddhāntaprāśastye tātparyāt*. 

[^378]: PRR 9.15-17: *atra kāmyakarmaṇāṃ svarūpataḥ saṃnyāsaḥ*. *svavarṇāśramādiniyatānāṃ tu* *bhagavadgītāṣṭādaśādhyāyanirṇītaprakāreṇa*

*sāttvikatyāgaḥ*. 

*svaśākhāgṛhyoktamaryādayā*

*sarvatra nityanaimittikādiparigrahaḥ*.

*sarvakarmaphalatyāgaṃ prāhus tyāgaṃ vicakṣaṇāḥ* //. [[232]]

erroneously thought that in the Āgamasiddhānta all actions are renounced, for there is a great variety of specific actions \[performed therein\].”380 

These verses are worth summarising because they strongly indicate that the Āgamasiddhānta was still a living tradition in the early part of the fourteenth century, when Vedāntadeśika composed the PRR. Moreover, this passage very much reads like a defence of the Āgamasiddhānta against a very specific accusation - namely, that of renouncing ritual action. Who, in the eyes of Vedāntadeśika, might have been 

“erroneously” suggesting that Āgamasiddhāntins do not engage in ritual action? Such an accusation is not, after all, included in the various objections against the Pāñcarātra which are listed in Yāmuna’s ĀP. First of all, it should be noted that Vedāntadeśika’s contention that Āgamasiddhāntins renounce only the desire which ordinarily motivates ritual action - i.e. they do not renounce ritual action *itself* - is supported by the PādS’s Caryāpāda, from which the above half- *śloka* is taken, as well as by several Āgamasiddhānta sources.381 Furthermore, it is significant that the PādS, like the PauṣS and the PārS, does actually on occasion refer to this renunciation of “desire” as simply the “renunciation of action” \( *karmasaṃnyāsa*\).382 

In other words, there is scriptural support for Vedāntadeśika’s aforementioned interpretation of PādS *cp* 19.117ab, not least in the PādS itself. In the absence of any evidence to the contrary, then, this suggests that the accusation that Āgamasiddhāntins do not engage in ritual action might have come from somewhere other than the Mantrasiddhānta, the tradition to which the majority of the PādS 

belonged. 

The most likely source of this criticism is perhaps the Vaikhānasa tradition. 

According to Gérard Colas \(1990: 24-25\), the Vaikhānasa *Samūrtārcanādhikaraṇa* states that the Pāñcarātra “is esteemed by hermits \( *vanastha*\) and ascetics \( *yatin*\)”, and several other Vaikhānasa works cited by Colas also include the claim that \(in Colas’ words\) “while the Vaikhānasa cult is citadine, the Pāñcarātra is prescribed for 380 PRR 9.17-10.1: *ata āgamasiddhānte sarvakarmasvarūpatyāga iti na bhramitavyam, karmaviśeṣa-bhūyastvāt*. 

[^381]: See for example PādS *cp* 21.34c-36, where Āgamasiddhāntins are said to be devoted to the *pañcakāla * ritual system, and to worship God “without desire” \( *nirāśa*\). Among Āgamasiddhānta sources, see for instance PauṣS 27.4 and 38.28c-32, and PārS 15.14c-18. 

[^382]: See for example PādS *cp* 21.35cd, PauṣS 38.32cd and PārS 15.16cd. [[233]]

far away places, outside towns, on a hill or a mountain, near a river or an ocean, in forests”. Such descriptions of the Pāñcarātra as a renunciative tradition as opposed to an urban, temple-based cult must, of course, be assessed alongside the context from which they emerged. Elsewhere, Colas \(1995: 117\) addresses this issue when he writes of the opposition between “les deux écoles âgamiques, celles-ci s’affrontant pour obtenir le contrôle du rituel dans les temples de l’Inde du Sud” \(“The two Āgamic schools \[i.e. the Vaikhānasa and the Pāñcarātra\] which clashed with one another in the attempt to gain control of ritual in the temples of South India”\). Of particular relevance to the question we are addressing presently, Colas \(ibid: 117-118\) notes that : “À l’époque de Vedānta Deśika, les querelles entre les desservants de temple se réclamant de l’une et de l’autre école âgamique vishnuite ne cessent de croître et de s’étendre avec la prolifération des temples publics” \(“At the time of Vedanta Desika, the quarrels between the temple priests claiming \[allegiance to\] one or other Vaiṣṇava Āgamic school continue to grow and expand with the proliferation of public temples”\). Further on, moreover, Colas \(ibid: 119\) suggests that Vaikhānasa authors may have been directing their criticisms at one Pāñcarātra group *in particular*, namely those who had abandoned their Vedic *sūtra*. “C’est peut-être cette partie de l’école pāñcarātra”, writes Colas, “que les manuels des prêtres vaikhānasa visaient à stigmatiser” \(“It is perhaps this branch of the Pāñcarātra school which the manuals of the Vaikhānasa priests aimed at stigmatising”\). 

If Colas is correct, it would seem quite likely, then, that in his PRR 

Vedāntadeśika is defending the Āgamasiddhānta against criticisms which were coming from within the Vaikhānasa tradition. After all, the Āgamasiddhāntins or Ekāyanas are those Pāñcarātrikas who, according to both the ĀP \(169.7 *ff*\) and the PRR \(4.5 *ff*\), had “abandoned” the *dharma* of the triple Veda \( *trayīdharma*\) in order to follow the Gṛhyasūtras of their “own *śākhā*”. In addition, when the PauṣS 

\(27.637d\) 

refers 

to 

“those 

who 

have 

abandoned 

mixed 

worship” 

\( *vyāmiśrārādhanojjhitāḥ*\), we can assume that it is the Ekāyanas who are meant. 

Irrespective of the source of these criticisms, this discussion raises another possible explanation as to why Vedāntadeśika, who himself did *not* abandon allegiance to the 

“triple Veda” as the highest scriptural authority, might have sought to defend the 234 

Āgamasiddhāntins, who had abandoned that allegiance. He may have sought to defend them not only because they held positions of influence at the Raṅganāthasvāmin temple in Śrīraṅgam, but also because they were the Pāñcarātrikas who were especially subject to external criticism. Viewed in this way, the success of Vedāntadeśika’s *Defence of the Pāñcarātra* would have rested in large part on the success of his defence of the Āgamasiddhānta. For if criticisms of the Āgamasiddhānta could be used to denounce the Pāñcarātra in general, a successful defence of the latter could be built upon a persuasive vindication of the former. 

If authors belonging to the Vaikhānasa tradition occasionally ignored the internal divisions within the Pāñcarātra and resorted to branding the Pāñcarātra in general as “non-Vedic” \( *avaidika*\), or as devoted only to the attainment of *mokṣa*, or as not concerned with temple worship etc.,383 then Vedāntadeśika, like Yāmuna before him, also attempted to present a unified and coherent Pāñcarātra “system”, adherence to which would not contravene allegiance to the Veda.384 On occasion, as we might expect, Vedāntadeśika’s presentation of a harmonious Pāñcarātra system contains ideas drawn from distinct Pāñcarātra traditions which seem to contradict one another.385 However, generally his account is quite consistent. Although the PRR, unlike Yāmuna’s ĀP, does contain a number of descriptions of the Siddhānta divisions, as well as passages drawn from the scriptural literature which warn against 

“mixing” the Siddhāntas, Vedāntadeśika also attempts to minimise the importance of any internal “conflict”. Having quoted the PādS’s \( *cp* 19.113c-128b\) account of the Siddhānta divisions, for example, he is keen to point out that its descriptions of the Tantra and Tantrāntara Siddhāntas are in agreement with those given in the PauṣS. 

“If there is sameness of meaning between the two texts”, says Vedāntadeśika, “then there is no contradiction” \( *yadi dvayor granthayor aikārthyaṃ saṃbhavati tadā na* *virodhaḥ*, PRR 11.18-19\). Moreover, as we have seen, in the presentation of the PRR 

[^383]: See Colas \(1990\) for a list of Vaikhānasa classifications of the Pāñcarātra. 

[^384]: See especially PRR 21.7 *ff*, which asserts the validity and authority of Pāñcarātrika prescriptions for the installation and worship of the image of Viṣṇu when prescriptions for these rites are not contained in the Vedas \(that is, other than for the Baudhāyana, Vaikhānasa and Śaunaka schools\). 

[^385]: See for example PRR 3.7-12, wherein the Pāñcarātra is alternatively called the “fifth Veda” and 

“the root of the great Veda-tree” – the latter description being borrowed from PārS 1.76ab. [[235]]

the supremacy of the Āgamasiddhānta is not a “sectarian” issue, but one on which even the PādS, a work predominantly of the Mantrasiddhānta, is in agreement. 

Indeed, it is precisely this depiction of a universally acknowledged hierarchy of Pāñcarātra Siddhāntas which is key to Vedāntadeśika’s mitigating what is probably the most characteristic feature of Pāñcarātrika “sectarianism”, namely the prohibition against the “mixing” of Siddhāntas. For it is in this context that he quotes, without attribution, a passage which claims that Pāñcarātrikas are not only qualified to perform the rites of their “own” Siddhānta, they are also eligible for the ritual systems \( *tantra*\) of those Siddhāntas which are “lower” than their own. Thus, since the Āgamasiddhānta is at the top of the hierarchy, its members are also entitled to worship according to the systems prescribed by the Mantra, Tantra and Tantrāntara Siddhāntas. A Mantrasiddhāntin, meanwhile, is also qualified for the Tantra and Tantrāntara Siddhāntas, while a Tantrasiddhāntin is qualified in addition for the Tantrāntarasiddhānta. Likewise, members of each Siddhānta have the authority to worship in places which have been established by a Siddhānta “inferior” to their own. This means that, according to this account, Āgamasiddhāntins have the entitlement to worship in any Pāñcarātra temple, while Tantrāntarasiddhāntins appear to be restricted to worshipping in their own homes.386 

How are we to interpret these claims, and the inclusion of this passage in the PRR? Vedāntadeśika does not name the source of these verses, which is fairly unusual in this work, and I have been not been able to locate them in the scriptural literature. 

The most striking claim contained here is that members of the Āgamasiddhānta have the authority to perform all rites which are enjoined by the Mantrasiddhānta, the implication being that they can execute this entitlement without being guilty of 

“mixing Siddhāntas”, or of leaving their own Siddhānta and entering another. 

Vedāntadeśika then quotes another unnamed source which reinforces this idea by 386 PRR 13.9-14.4: *punar apy uparyupari tantrasthitānām adho ’dhas tantrādhikāritvam uktam –*

*tantrāntare tathā tantramantrasiddhāntavartmani *\(corr. *tantra-mantra siddhāntavartmani*\) * */ 

*dīkṣitānāṃ krameṇaiva hy uparyupari yogataḥ */ *anyeṣām adhikāraḥ syāt tattatsaṃskārapūrvakam *// **

*kāraṇāgamasiddhāntaniṣṭhenānyais tribhiḥ sadā */ *arcanīyam athānyābhyāṃ mantrasiddhāntinā*

*tathā *// *pūjanīyam athānyena tantrasiddhāntināniśam */ *svena tantrāntareṇaiva pūjanīyaṃ svake* *gṛhe *// *iti* / *atrāpy utkṛṣṭasiddhāntasthitenāpi apakṛṣṭasiddhāntasthāneṣu tattatsiddhānta-prakāreṇaiva pūjanīyatvam uktam*. [[236]]

stating that “if they are qualified for the principle \[ordinance\], \[then\] they are qualified for the secondary \[ordinance\]” \( *mukhyādikāriṇaḥ santi yadi gauṇādhikāriṇaḥ*, PRR 

14.6\). 

Could these unnamed sources possibly reflect and validate actual processes which were then taking place? In other words, *were* Āgamasiddhāntins affiliating themselves with the more Veda-congruent Pāñcarātra traditions? We can be fairly sure that the latter had by this time become the more dominant, so a transition of this nature would certainly have been expedient. Can this help to explain why non-Āgamasiddhānta scriptures begin to incorporate Āgamasiddhāntin canonical systems, such as the idea of the Ekāyanaveda and the supremacy of the JS, SS and PauṣS, within their own? And can it also help to explain the apparent disappearance of the Āgamasiddhānta, not only as a named Pāñcarātra tradition, but also as a strand within the Pāñcarātra whose representatives claimed the superiority of their own tradition over that of the Veda? 

These questions are very difficult to answer at present, and new sources may come to light which cast doubt upon their validity. It should also be restated that Vedāntadeśika quotes these unnamed sources alongside passages from the PārS, for example, which explicitly prohibit the mixing of Siddhāntas \( *siddhāntasāṃkarya*, see e.g. PRR 18.15-19.5, quoting PārS 19.545-548b\). He also mentions that according to the PārS and the *Kālottara*, entering a superior Siddhānta by abandoning an inferior one is not a fault, whereas abandoning a superior ‘Tantra’ \(i.e. Siddhānta\) to enter a 

“low” or “debased” one *is* a fault, and is equivalent to a mixing of Tantras \(i.e. 

separate ‘systems’\).387 Nonetheless, the processes proposed above, wherein Āgamasiddhāntins take on the practices of the more Veda-congruent Pāñcarātra traditions, could certainly help to explain how it was that the culture of Pāñcarātrika sectarianism gave way to the synthesis of previously distinct groups. 

Such processes could also, of course, help to explain the content of some of the passages which I have addressed in Chapter Eight: the fact that Ekāyana authors of the PauṣS changed their earlier position on “mixed worship”, for instance, and that they 387 PRR 28.16-19: *… apakṛṣṭasiddhāntaparityāgenāpi utkṛṣṭasiddhāntapraveśanaṃ na doṣāya;* *pratyuta guṇāyaiva; utkṛṣṭatantraparityāgena nikṛṣṭatantrapraveśane samānatantrasaṃkare ca doṣa* *ity uktam. * [[237]]

began to address, and promise rewards to, worshippers who “desire fruits” 

\( *phalārthin*\); and also the verses in the PārS and the ĪS which authorise the worship, albeit “without devotion and loyalty”, of Viṣṇu’s subordinate deities, irrespective of the “distress” that this may cause to those “of little understanding”. It should also be borne in mind that reparation rites \( *prāyaścitta*\) were devised by the traditions which authored these texts in the event that a “mixing of Siddhāntas” or the abandoning of one Siddhānta for another should occur, and that the very existence of these rites suggests that such events *did* occur. Indeed, when taken together, these passages in the PauṣS, the PārS and the ĪS suggest that if Āgamasiddhāntins did begin to abandon their ideals and allign themselves with more Veda-congruent patterns of worship, then this process began well before Vedāntadeśika’s time. The fact that the Āgamsiddhānta is still referred to as a living tradition in the PRR, as it is also in presumably younger works such as the ĪS and the ŚrīprśS, indicates, of course, that it could not have reached its completion until a later date.
