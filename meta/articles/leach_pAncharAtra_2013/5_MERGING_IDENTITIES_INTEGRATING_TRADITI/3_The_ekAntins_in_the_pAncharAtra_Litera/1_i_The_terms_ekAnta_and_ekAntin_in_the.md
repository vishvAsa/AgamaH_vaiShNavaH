title = "1 i \\) The terms ekānta and ekāntin in the Pāñcarātra scriptures"

+++
In a contribution to the volume *Nārāyaṇīya-Studien*, Reinhold Grünendahl \(1997\) discusses the “profile of ideas” \( *Ideenprofil*\) which many later works borrow from the *Nārāyaṇīya*. In particular, he draws attention to a large number of parallel passages that the *Viṣṇudharmottarapurāṇa*, the *Viṣṇurahasya*, and the *Vaiṣṇavakhaṇḍa* of the *Skandapurāṇa* 349 share with the *Nārāyaṇīya*. In this later literature, as we would expect, events from Part A of the *Nārāyaṇīya*, such as Nārada’s journey to Mount Meru and his vision of White Island there, are retold from the *bhakti* perspective of Part B. In the following, I address the history of one of the most important borrowings from the *Nārāyaṇīya* in the Pāñcarātra scriptural literature, namely the descriptions of a class of worshipper called ‘Ekāntin’. Here too, as we will see, it is the perspective of Part B of the *Nārāyaṇīya* that shapes the religious identities of these “later” Ekāntins. I intend to ask here, in particular, what the appropriation of the idea of the Ekāntins in these scriptural works can tell us about the religious identities of the authors who take up the term, and the worshippers to whom it is applied. As in the last chapter, I begin by focussing on the employment of the word *ekānta*. 

In the *Jayākhyasaṃhitā *\(JS\), the term *ekānta* is most frequently employed alongside the adjective *nirjana* or *vijana* \(“deserted”\) to refer to a secluded or solitary place which is to be inhabited by the *sādhaka* who aspires to achieve mastery of a mantra \( *mantrasiddhi*\).350 Elsewhere in the JS, we also find the term used in the sense of a “single aim” \(3.18b\), and in the adverbial sense of “absolutely”, as in the following instance: “Absolutely flawless knowledge, free from all limitations, arises 349 This is the *Skandapurāṇa * published by the Veṅkateśvara Press in 1910. 

350 See e.g. JS 17.19c, 19.2a, 26.116b, 27.72c, 29.129b and 31.40c. On the concept *mantrasiddhi* see Rastelli \(2000\). In the same article Rastelli \(ibid: 343\) makes the important point that “the *sādhaka* does not live in seclusion in order to renounce the world but in order to gain powers to rule over it”. [[207]]

gradually for one who is yoked through the repeated practice of yoga”.351 It is striking that in the JS as well as in other scriptural works, the term *ekānta* is overwhelmingly found, even when it carries an apparently “neutral” meaning as in the verse just quoted, within contexts which are primarily concerned with the recitation of mantras \( *japa*\), or with meditation \( *dhyāna*\), asceticism or yoga. In this respect, one cannot fail to be reminded of the use of *ekānta* in the *Mahābhārata* \(MBh\), and especially in the *Mokṣadharmaparvan*. Most commonly in the JS the term occurs within the context of prescriptions for the repetition of mantras \( *japa*\), but it is also linked contextually with meditation \(or “visualisation”, *dhyāna*, e.g. 

10.2c, 31.40c\) and with asceticism \(27.72c\). 

Elsewhere among the scriptural works, the *Paramasaṃhitā *\(ParS\) and the *Lakṣmītantra* \(LT\) both use the word *ekānta* on a number of occasions, and in contexts consistent with its use in the MBh and the JS. In the ParS, for instance, we read as follows: “Having first restrained the senses via non-attachment, he whose attention is firm should steadily fix his mind upon the lord of the gods, his resolve one-pointed \( *ekāntaniścayaḥ*\).”352 “He should practise yoga”, the passage continues, 

“by which the god of gods is pleased” \(ParS 10.24: *yogaṃ samabhyaset tena* *devadevaḥ prasīdati*\). A few verses later, it is said that the activity of the mind \( *cittavṛtti*\) should be brought under control “in a solitary place” \( *ekānte*\).353 Similar instructions for the practice of *japa* and meditation are found elsewhere in the ParS 

\(e.g. 10.71, 11.24ab, 17.42cd, 27.35ab, 30.67cd\). In the opening chapter of the LT, meanwhile, Śakra \(Indra\) is described as having attained the state of *ekānta* \( *ekāntabhāva*, LT 1.54a\) shortly after his ascetic practices directed towards Lakṣmī 

have been enumerated.354 Lakṣmī, in response, tells him “I am pleased by your very 351 JS 5.2: *sarvopādhivinirmuktaṃ jñānam ekāntanirmalam */ *utpadyate hi yuktasya yogābhyāsāt* *krameṇa tat* //. 

352 ParS 10.22: *vairāgyeṇendriyāṇy ādau nigṛhya dṛḍhamānasaḥ */ *samaṃ dadhīta deveśe cittam* *ekāntaniścayaḥ *//. 

353 ParS 10.31: *upakramair bahutaraiś cittavṛttiṃ śanaiḥ śanaiḥ */ *ānayed vaśam ekānte tvarayā na* *kadācana *//. 

354 LT 1.49-50: *tatra divyaṃ tapas tepe bilvamūlaniketanaḥ */ *ekapādasthito maunī kāṣṭhabhūto*

*’nilāśanaḥ *// *ūrdhvadṛgbāhuvaktraś ca niyato niyatātmavān */ *divyaṃ varṣasahasraṃ vai tapas tepe* *suduścaram* //. – “There, his home at the base of a Bel tree, he practised divine asceticism. Standing completely motionless on one leg, silent, subsisting on the air alone, his face and arms raised to the sky, restrained, self-controlled, he practised very severe asceticism for a thousand divine years.” [[208]]

strict asceticism” \( *prasannāsmi tapasā tava suvrata*, 1.55ab\), and she grants him a request, the consequence of which is the teaching which comprises the remainder of the text. Later in the LT, the term *ekānta* is used to refer to a “solitary place” which is suitable for the performance of *japa* \(47.11ab\), and to the “solitary life” 

\( *ekāntaśīla*\) appropriate to one who is devoted to the visualisation \( *dhyāna*\) and recitation \( *japa*\) of the *jayāmantra* \(48.11-13\). 

Another example of the use of *ekānta* in the context of *japa* and *dhyāna* can be found in the opening verses of the final chapter of the *Viṣṇusaṃhitā* \(ViṣṇuS\). Here, we are introduced to the supreme Bhāgavata yoga, the highest good which has never before been heard by others.355 The passage reads as follows: 

*yuktāhāravihāras tu yuktaceṣṭaḥ samāhitaḥ */ *yogaṃ bhāgavataṃ nityam* *abhyasen niyatātmavān *// * pañcakālavibhāgajño mitabhāṣī mitāśanaḥ */ 

*kāmakrodhādijid bhaktaḥ samaloṣṭāśmakāñcanaḥ *// *samayācārasaṃyukto* *japadhyānaparāyaṇaḥ */ *ekānte vijane sthāne nivāte śabdavarjite *// *baddhvā*

*yogāsanaṃ maunī yogaṃ yuñjīta yogavit */. - “His diet and lifestyle moderate, his movements curbed, concentrated, he \[the devotee\], disciplined and composed, should always practise the Bhāgavata yoga. Knowing the divisions of the five times, measured in his speech and diet, conquering desire and anger and so forth, the devotee \[for whom\] a lump of earth, a rock and gold are all the same, is wholly intent upon the recitation \[of mantras\] \( *japa*\) and meditation upon god \( *dhyāna*\), in accordance with established practice. Having assumed the yoga posture in a solitary \( *ekānte*\), deserted \( *vijane*\) place that is safe and quiet, the knower of yoga, remaining silent, should practise yoga.” \(ViṣṇuS 30.2-5b\) Each of the scriptural works mentioned thus far in this section – the JS, the ParS, the LT and the ViṣṇuS – also contain descriptions of Ekāntins, or in the case of the ViṣṇuS, of Ekāntikas. In the ParS, these descriptions occur during the first and final chapters, both of which, as we have seen, have been identified by Czerniak-Drożdżowicz \(2003\) as having been added to the older “ritualistic corpus” of the text by later redactors. The descriptions in question \(ParS 1.17-24 and 31.1-43\) are 355 ViṣṇuS 30.1: *atha vakṣyāmi saṃkṣepād yogaṃ bhāgavataṃ param */ *yad anyair aśrutaṃ pūrvaṃ*

*hitānāṃ paramaṃ hitam *//. The second half- *śloka * finds a parallel at ParS 30.4cd, and indeed the 30th chapter of the ViṣṇuS shares a number of parallel verses with the 30th chapter of the ParS. The latter is also concerned with the practice of yoga within a *bhakti* framework which emphasises god’s kindness \( *anugraha*, *prasāda*\). See e.g. ViṣṇuS 30.5ab ↔ ParS 30.6cd; ViṣṇuS 30.7cd ↔ ParS 30.11cd; ViṣṇuS 30.8c-13 ↔ ParS 30.14-18; ViṣṇuS 30.27-29b ↔ ParS 30.75-77b; ViṣṇuS 30.33c-36 ↔ ParS 

30.93-96b; ViṣṇuS 30.39-42a ↔ ParS 30.100c-104a. [[209]]

contained in passages which explicitly invoke the *Nārāyaṇīya*. Accordingly, the Ekāntins are described here in ways which echo accounts in the earlier text: they are 

“perfected beings” \( *siddhāḥ*, ParS 1.22c, 31.13b-18a; cf. MBh 12.326.19a\) wholly devoted to meditating only on the Supreme Person \( *puruṣottamam evaikaṃ*

*dhyāyantas tatparāyaṇāḥ*, ParS 1.23cd\). They are beyond dualities and without possessions \( *nirdvandvā niṣparigrahāḥ*, ParS 1.24b; cf. MBh 12.326.42b\). They have subdued their sense faculties and are always engaged in meditation \( *paripakvakaṣāyāś ca sarvadā dhyānatatparāḥ*, ParS 1.24cd\).356 They live on White Island \( *śvetadvīpa*, ParS 31.4c, 11\), the “abode of yogins” \(ParS 1.17d-18b\), are 

“illustrious” \( *mahābhāgāḥ*, ParS 31.4a; cf. MBh 12.326.19a\), and are “intensely concentrated” \( *susamāhitāḥ*, ParS 31.29d; cf. MBh 12.326.116d\). 

The description of Ekāntins in the LT \(17.9-20\) also contains echoes of the *Nārāyaṇīya*, as well as of another passage in the *Mokṣadharmaparvan*, even if it does not invoke the earlier text as explicitly as the ParS.357 There is no mention here, for example, of White Island. The LT equates Ekāntins with “perfected beings” 

\( *siddhāḥ*, LT 17.10-11\) who know thoroughly Veda and Vedānta \(LT 17.10b\), who are Sāṃkhyas learned in “enumerative knowledge” \( *saṃkhyā* or *saṃkhyāna*, LT 

17.11cd; cf. MBh 12.294.30cd\), whose senses are withdrawn, who are conversant with the meditative techniques of fixing the mind \( *dhāraṇā*\) and visualisation \( *dhyāna*\), and who are concentrated \( *samāhita*\) Yogas \(LT 17.12\).358 They persist 

“without food” \( *anāhārāḥ*\), are “illustrious” \( *mahābhāgāḥ*\), and they constantly behold Lakṣmī and Nārāyaṇa \(LT 17.16c-17b\). 

In these passages from the ParS and the LT, the term *ekāntin* is used, as it is in the *Nārāyaṇīya*, to refer to the most accomplished worshippers, those who are uniquely capable of attaining the highest goal. The Ekāntins here are the perfect devotees, and as such, they are not intended to represent a specific “group” among the audience of these texts. Rather, the designation *ekāntin* represents an ideal, and 356 ParS 1.24: *ekāntino mudā yuktā nirdvandvā niṣparigrahāḥ */ *paripakvakaṣāyāś ca sarvadā*

*dhyānatatparāḥ *//. 

357 On the interpolated passage LT 41.67-78, which applies the honorific *paramaikāntin* to 800 sages \( *muni*\) learned in the Kāṇva and Mādhyandina schools, see Rastelli \(2006: 233-236\). 

358 This use of the terms *sāṃkhya* and *yoga* as plural nouns referring to adherents of the “schools” 

Sāṃkhya and Yoga is also found in the *Mokṣadharmaparvan*, see Fitzgerald \( *forthcoming*\). [[210]]

one whose contours have been drawn already in the *Nārāyaṇīya*. In this sense these passages differ from those in the JS and the ViṣṇuS which, as we have seen in Chapter Two, use the terms *ekāntin * and *ekāntika* to designate one particular group of Vaiṣṇavas among others. In the JS, the Ekāntin is named as one of five distinct types of Vaiṣṇava, all of whom are “born into this great lineage of those devoted only to Nārāyaṇa” \( *nārāyaṇaikaniṣṭhānāṃ ye ’smin jātā mahākule*, JS 22.4cd\). Each of the five, named in JS 22 \(6-19b\) as Yati, Ekāntin, Vaikhānasa, Karmasāttvata and Śikhin, are said to observe the duties of the five times \( *pañcakāla*, 22.3b\). The same five types of Vaiṣṇava are listed together in the previous chapter \(JS 21.78-81\) as recipients of gifts at the end of the festival of the purifying threads \( *pavitrotsava*\). 

In the description in JS 22, the Ekāntin is characterised as wandering, begging alms from Brahmins \(literally “from those devoted to the six duties”\), being respected or treated hospitably \( *satkṛta*, by Brahmins?\), being without possessions, worshipping god in accordance with the eight-limbed method, living alone with a pupil possessed of good qualities, being intent upon contemplation, and being a qualified Vaiṣṇava by virtue of his place in an order of succession \( *kulakrama*\) \(i.e. 

rather than, presumably, via initiation\).359 In the ViṣṇuS, as we have seen in Chapter Two, the Ekāntika is named as one of five Pañcarātra lineages \( *gocara*\) alongside the Vaikhānasa, Sāttvata, Śikhin, and Mūlaka. The Ekāntika is described here as subsisting on begged alms, as serving the twice-born classes, and as worshipping god once a day.360 According to the *Hāriṇī*, the commentary on the ViṣṇuS authored by Nārāyaṇa, a Nambūtiri Brahmin \(Unni 1991: 12-13\) who most likely lived in the 359 JS 22.11-13b: *bhrāntvā bhikṣāṃ *\(corr. *mikṣāṃ*\) *ca ṣaṭkarmaniratebhyas tu satkṛtām */ 

*aparigrahavān yo vai tayā saṃpūjayet prabhum *// * pumān goptāram avyaktam aṣṭāṅgavidhinā mahat*

/ *guṇinā saha śiṣyena vasaty eko vicāradhīḥ *// *kulakrameṇādhikārī sa ekāntīha vaiṣṇavaḥ */. The 

“eight-limbed method” is described at JS 22.75c-80b as consisting of 1.\) approaching god \( *abhigamana*\); 2.\) worshipping with *arghya* and flowers etc. \( *bhoga*\); 3.\) worshipping with honey, clarified butter, oil, sour milk \( *dadhi*\), or with an animal; 4.\) worshipping with food \(22.78b: *annena* *pūjanam* corr. *antena pūjanam* after Rastelli 2000a: 107 n. 24\); 5.\) the giving away of food which has been used in worship \( *saṃpradāna*\); 6.\) the fire offering \( *vahnisaṃtarpana*\); 7.\) the offering to ancestors \( *pitṛyāga*\); and 8.\) the final sacrifice \( *anuyāga*\), namely the offering of food into the internal fires which are one’s breaths \( *prāṇāgnihavana*\). 

360 ViṣṇuS 2.32c-33b: *śuśrūṣaṇaṃ dvijātīnāṃ bhaikṣavṛttyā ca vartanam *// *sakṛc cārādhanaṃ yeṣāṃ*

*te tathaikāntikāḥ smṛtāḥ */. [[211]]

fifteenth or sixteenth century,361 the Ekāntikas are Śūdras, and theirs is the lowest of the five lineages \(Czerniak-Drożdżowicz 2010: 228-236\). Although the ViṣṇuS itself does not explicitly make these claims, it appears to suggest the same by characterising Ekāntikas as serving the twice-born, while associating the Sāttvatas and Śikhins with, respectively, Kṣatriyas and Vaiśyas.362 

What can we learn from these short descriptions of the Ekāntin and the Ekāntika in the JS and the ViṣṇuS? First of all, it should be noted that the two accounts may have been composed several centuries apart, though as we have seen, the passages in the JS which mention Ekāntins \(JS 20.265-270, 21.78-81, 22.1 *ff*\) are unlikely to belong to the oldest portions of this text, since they list the Ekāntins alongside Vaikhānasas, who appear to have been restricted to South India in premodern times. This suggests that these passages were themselves composed and added to the JS in the south. In theory, then, the interval between the composition of the accounts in the JS and ViṣṇuS may be considerably shorter than might otherwise be assumed, given that the composition of the JS is normally assigned *en bloc* to North India or the upper Deccan during the ninth century. At any rate, the continuities between the JS’s Ekāntin and the ViṣṇuS’s Ekāntika are clear to see. 

Both are depicted as renunciants who support themselves by means of begging, and both accounts present the Ekāntin/Ekāntika as one of five named Vaiṣṇava lineages or groups alongside the Vaikhānasa, the Śikhin and the Karmasāttvata or Sāttvata. 

With regard to the names of these other Vaiṣṇavas, the obvious discrepancy is between the JS’s *yati* and the ViṣṇuS’s *mūlaka*. It is notable, however, that these descriptions of the Yati and the Mūlaka contain some striking similarities: both 361 Marzenna Czerniak-Drożdżowicz has kindly informed me by email \(dated 10/12/2011\) that in his introduction to *The Tantrasamuccaya of Nārāyaṇa with the Commentary Vimarśinī of Śaṅkara* \(ed. T. 

Ganapati Śāstrī, Delhi: Nag Publishers, 1989\), N. P. Unni identifies the author of the *Hāriṇī* as a pupil of Śaṅkara, the fifteenth century commentator on the *Tantrasamuccaya*. 

362 See ViṣṇuS 2.30ab, where Sāttvatas are said to support their families by means of livelihoods consonant with the Kṣatriya class \( *kṣatravṛttyopapannena kuṭumbasya ca poṣaṇam*\), and 2.31c where Śikhins are said to support themselves by means of agriculture, trade and breeding cattle \( *kṛṣivāṇijyagorakṣā*\). [[212]]

receive means by which to live “without asking” \( *āyacita*, JS 22.9b and ViṣṇuS 

2.34c\), and both worship god in thought, word and deed.363 

Indeed, there are a number of similarities between the fivefold classifications found in the JS and the ViṣṇuS, while the differences between the two accounts are equally illuminating. As stated above, in the ViṣṇuS the Ekāntikas are said to serve the twice-born, while the Sāttvatas are presented as Kṣatriyas, and the Śikhins as Vaiśyas. The *Hāriṇī * commentary, meanwhile, identifies both the Vaikhānasas and the Mūlakas as Brahmins \(Czerniak-Drożdżowicz 2010: 232, 234\). Although the ViṣṇuS itself does not make this connection, it does describe the Vaikhānasas and Mūlakas in similar terms – both are said to support themselves “by unsolicited means” \( *ayācitopapannena*, ViṣṇuS 2.28c, 34c\). While it is not emphatic or indeed very clearly expressed, there is, at any rate, clearly a hierarchy at work in the ViṣṇuS’s fivefold classification, and the Ekāntikas, servants of the twice-born, are at the bottom of this hierarchy. Their lowly position here brings to mind the sectarianism which characterised certain South Indian Pāñcarātra contexts. Of course, within such contexts, it should not greatly surprise us that the ViṣṇuS should accord a low status to the Ekāntika for, as we have seen, the authors of this work clearly located themselves within a Pāñcarātra tradition which they considered to be 

“based on” or “rooted in” the Veda. Such traditions commonly distinguished themselves from those Pāñcarātrikas that appropriated the name ‘Ekāntin’ and called their own tradition the Āgamasiddhānta or Ekāyana. Whether the ViṣṇuS was itself composed in such a sectarian context is, however, rather difficult to affirm. It does not appear to associate itself with any one of the five Vaiṣṇava lineages, despite its avowal that one of the ways in which the lineages are distinguished from one another is the fact that they have different texts \( *pāṭhaviśeṣa*, ViṣṇuS 2.23a\). Nor does it include polemic against other Pañcarātra groups. But we can hypothesise that its depiction of the Ekāntika may at least contain echoes of an earlier \(or perhaps of a geographically distant\) sectarian animosity. 

363 See JS 22.8ab: *karmaṇā manasā vācā yajanty ekam adhokṣajam*; and ViṣṇuS 2.34ab: *arcanam* *devadevasya manovākkāyakarmabhiḥ*. [[213]]

How does the account in the JS compare? Like the ViṣṇuS, the JS incorporates membership of social class \( *varṇa*\) into its fivefold classification. According to its presentation, the Yatis \(22.10c\), Vaikhānasas \(22.13c\), Karmasāttvatas \(22.16d\) and Śikhins \(22.18b\) are all Brahmins, while the Ekāntins are not explicitly linked with any *varṇa*. Why should the author of this section of the JS make a point of identifying these other groups as Brahmins while saying nothing about the social class of Ekāntins? Of course, it may not have been the author’s intention to convey anything by this omission. However, when this is read alongside the ViṣṇuS’s account, it seems to suggest that in the presumably South Indian context in which these verses were written, the Vaiṣṇavas who called themselves Ekāntin were not always considered by others to be Brahmins, or even members of the twice-born classes. Might these be the Pāñcarātrikas who are identified as “non-Brahmins” by Yāmuna’s opponents in the *Āgamaprāmāṇya* \(e.g. ĀP 11.5 *ff*\)? This cannot be answered with any confidence, but perhaps the author of these verses in the JS was aware of a controversy regarding the social status of these ‘Ekāntins’, and therefore decided to omit any reference it. This is speculative, but we should note, at any rate, that the JS’s account of the Ekāntins is substantially more positive than that found in the ViṣṇuS. Where the latter has the Ekāntikas serving the twice-born \(which would presumably include the other named Vaiṣṇava lineages\), in the JS the Ekāntins are respected renunciants who receive alms from Brahmins. We might construe these contrasting descriptions in the JS and the ViṣṇuS as themselves different interpretations of the Ekāntins’ apparent non-inclusion among the three highest classes: while the ViṣṇuS regards them as Śūdras, the authors of this section of the JS 

may consider them to exist outside of the *varṇa* system altogether. At the least, it seems safe to conclude that despite their differing views on the status of the Ekāntin or Ekāntika, neither the JS’s nor the ViṣṇuS’s accounts were authored by people who identified themselves as Ekāntin or Ekāntika. 

It is precisely to the self-identifying Ekāntins in South India that I now turn. As we have seen in earlier chapters, the Āgamasiddhāntin or Ekāyana authors who contributed towards the composition of the *Pauṣkarasaṃhitā *\(PauṣS\), the *Pārameśvarasaṃhitā *\(PārS\) and the *Īśvarasaṃhitā* \(ĪS\) also called themselves 214 

Ekāntins and, in reference to the *Nārāyaṇīya*, their religion the *ekāntidharma *\(PārS 

1.60a, ĪS 1.30c; cf. MBh 12.336.57a\). They also, it should be noted, identified themselves as Brahmins \(e.g. PauṣS 36.260c, 38.293c-294, PārS 13.56ab, 15.160ab, ĪS 18.230b\). For these authors, the term *ekāntin* appears to denote both the “single goal” of liberation * and* monotheism \(see especially PauṣS 36.259c-263b\). Although, as we have seen, neither of these characteristics feature in the descriptions of Ekāntins and Ekāntikas in the JS and the ViṣṇuS, for Ekāntin authors they are two of the attributes which most crucially set them apart from non-Ekāntin Pāñcarātrikas \(PauṣS 36.259c-263b, PārS 1.17b, 33cd, ĪS 1.22cd, 21.515cd\). Among demonstrably South Indian texts, Yāmuna’s ĀP contains one of the earliest uses of the term *ekāntin* in reference to the Pāñcarātra. It is used in the sense of monotheism, here applied to Pāñcarātrikas in general, in order to distinguish them from “ordinary” \(i.e. Smārta\) Brahmins with their own “insignificant little gods”.364 We find an echo of this at PauṣS 36.261-263b, which I have quoted earlier, where Ekāntins are said to worship no god other than Vāsudeva, in contrast to Pāñcarātrika Brahmins that are mixed worshippers \( *vyāmiśrayājin*\), who worship a multitude of inferior deities. On several occasions the PauṣS also juxtaposes the Ekāntins with devotees who desire worldly fruits. However, as we will see in the following section, a few scriptural passages indicate that the boundaries between the self-proclaimed ‘Ekāntins’ and the other Pāñcarātrikas became less clear over time.
