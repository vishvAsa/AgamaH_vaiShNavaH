It is not easy to locate the AS and the LT in relation to the other published Pāñcarātra Saṃhitās. There are several clues, as Begley and Sanderson have shown, that both are South Indian in origin, but excepting their prescriptions for the recitation of Vedic and Pāñcarātrika mantras and, in the case of the AS especially, their pronounced leanings towards Brahminical orthodoxy, they are different in many respects to the South Indian scriptural works which I have addressed in previous chapters. Other than a clearly interpolated section of the LT \(41.67-68\), neither text gives any indication of the Pāñcarātrika sectarianism which appears to have dominated certain South Indian contexts in the 12th and 13th centuries. This may suggest that both works predate this period of sectarian hostility, or that they are products of an area which was not affected by it. It is notable that, in contrast to the majority of South Indian Saṃhitās at my disposal \(e.g. the SanS, ViṣS, PādS, NārS, PārS, ĪS, and ViṣṇuS\), neither the AS nor the LT make any reference to the Vaikhānasa tradition. 

It may be tentatively proposed that both were composed in urban, cosmopolitan centres where the Pāñcarātra had some prominence. As mentioned above, many chapters of the AS are directly addressed to prospective royal patrons. 

The fact that neither work is particularly concerned with the details of temple ritual may indicate that other Pāñcarātra texts were in use alongside them. Interestingly, both have incorporated material and ideas from Kashmirian Śaiva sources \(Sanderson 2001: 35-38\) and in their metaphysical positions and their attitudes towards other teachings, appear to have been substantially influenced by Kashmirian literature. 

The idea of the compatibility of the five teachings Pañcarātra, Veda, Sāṃkhya, Yoga, and Pāśupata is clearly incorporated from the *Nārāyaṇīya*. Like that text, both works aim to include, and thereby subordinate, the four latter teachings within a comprehensive Vaiṣṇava *dharma*. However, it is notable that the AS and the LT go, as it were, one step further than the *Nārāyaṇīya* in that they genuinely integrate Śaiva ideas into their syncretistic world-view.

The AS’s presentation of the five teachings can, I believe, be interpreted as a conscious attempt to renew the integrative project undertaken by the authors of the *Nārāyaṇīya*, and to bring that project up to date. Hence, its descriptions of the five teachings do not rely on the *Nārāyaṇīya*’s reports of what were then apparently relatively loosely coordinated traditions. Rather, “Epic” Sāṃkhya and Yoga are replaced by the “Classical” systems, so that ‘Sāṃkhya’, for instance, is represented by the *Saṣṭitantra* \(AS 12.18-31b\), the lost, apparently systematic philosophical text \(see Schrader 1916: 110-111\) of which the *Sāṃkhyakārikā* \(72\) claims to be a summary. ‘Yoga’ is Pātañjala Yoga \(AS 31.18-32.76\). Ideas associated with 

‘Pāśupata’, as I have mentioned above, actually belong to the, by this time, more prominent Śaiva Siddhānta. ‘Veda’ now incorporates 21 branches of knowledge \( *vidyā*\). 

What, then, of ‘Pañcarātra’ itself? Does the AS present a “Classical” model of this system, a comprehensive synthesis and summary of its diverse teachings, practices and religious identities? This is rather difficult to answer, since from our perspective, based on the available evidence in the other Pāñcarātra Saṃhitās, it most certainly does not. However, the AS does consistently present the Pāñcarātra as a single “system” \( *tantra*\) or “law” \( *dharma*\), and it also contains a short, systematic and rather esoteric summary \( *saṃkṣepa*\) of the Pāñcarātra, distinguishing between ten “collections \[of teachings\]” \( *saṃhitā*\). These are listed as follows: God \( *bhagavat*\), ritual \( *karma*\), knowledge \( *vidyā*\), time \( *kāla*\), duty \( *kartavya*\), special rites \( *vaiśeṣikī kriyā*\), restraining the mind and sense-faculties \( *saṃyama*\), contemplation \( *cintā*\), the “path” \( *mārga*\), and liberation \( *mokṣa*\) \(AS 12.45-48\). 

This is hardly a comprehensive “summary” of the Pāñcarātra tradition that is available to us through its scriptural literature. It is, though, comprehensive in another sense: it is general enough to be able to incorporate the methods of Veda, Sāṃkhya, Yoga and Pāśupata, and this is no doubt the author’s intention. For although “time” could probably be interpreted by the AS’s audience, if necessary, as referring to the Pāñcarātra teaching of the “five times” \(as it is by Schrader\), there is no terminology here which is peculiar to the Pāñcarātra. Unsurprisingly, we do not find similar summaries of the Pāñcarātra elsewhere in the scriptural works. Indeed, 175 

the apparent originality of this presentation raises the question of the Pāñcarātra’s identity in the period and place of the AS’s composition. For the fact that its authors were free to present the Pāñcarātra in this way suggests that the identity of this tradition was, in that period and place, open to revision and reinvention.
