In her illuminating work on the *Paramasaṃhitā* \(ParS\), Czerniak-Drożdżowicz \(2003: 35\) identifies two main layers of this text: i.\) an older layer “representing what we may call a tantric way of thinking”, which she also refers to as “the ritualistic corpus”; and ii.\) a younger layer representing “a more orthodox brahmanical and devotional attitude”. The latter, at least, was very probably composed in South India \(ibid.: 147\). Czerniak-Drożdżowicz notes that the account of the ParS’s revelation and transmission, which belongs to the younger layer of the text and which forms the “frame story” of its first and final chapters, explicitly connects the teaching of the ParS with that given in the *Nārāyaṇīya*. It does this in a number of ways, including setting the scene of the revelation in the same mythical place, namely White Island \( *śvetadvīpa*\). As has been mentioned above, we find the same strategy in the opening chapter of the *Pārameśvarasaṃhitā*, and it is also present in the *śāstrāvataraṇa * sections of other South Indian works, such as the *Īśvarasaṃhitā*, for example, and the *Śrīpraśnasaṃhitā*. Grünendahl \(see especially 1989: 34 *ff*\) shows that such strategies are not limited to the Saṃhitās, for they can also be found, for example, in the *Viṣṇudharmāḥ* and the *Viṣṇurahasya*. 

Allusions to the *Nārāyaṇīya* are so common in the Pāñcarātra scriptural corpus that they cannot, it seems, tell us very much about the particular Pāñcarātrika identities of the authors who make use of them. Both Ekāyana and non-Ekāyana authors connect their own texts to the *Nārāyaṇīya*. However, it is notable that, of the older Saṃhitās, the *Sātvatasaṃhitā* \(SS\) makes no reference to the *Nārāyaṇīya* in its brief opening chapter on the transmission of the teaching and that, indeed, the only obvious reference to it in the entire work is in the final chapter, where it is said that the temple \( *devatāyatana*\) is “equivalent to White Island” \( *śvetadvīpasamam*, SS 

25.310ab\). As I have argued above, I strongly suspect this chapter to be a later 153 

addition to the SS. In my view it was probably added in South India, though there is little internal evidence for this. It is also quite likely, in my view, that the opening chapter of the *Jayākhyasaṃhitā* \(JS\), the so-called “beginning of the teaching” 

\( *śāstrārambha*\), together with the first 30 verses of its second chapter, do not belong to the oldest layer of this text, though this is rather more difficult to establish. Before the interpolation of the *Adhikaḥ Pāṭhaḥ*, this section \(JS 1.1-2.30\), at any rate, clearly formed a textual unit. There are, as Grünendahl \(1997: 363-364\) has noted, a number of themes, stories, incidents, characters and geographical locations here which are clearly borrowed from the *Nārāyaṇīya*. One of my reasons for suspecting that this section of the JS may have been a later addition is that none of these \(other than Nārada, who receives the teaching of which the JS is an abridgement\) are referred to again, and nor is Śāṇḍilya, one of the main interlocutors in this extended passage. 

The *Pauṣkarasaṃhitā*, meanwhile, does not contain a history of the transmission of the teaching. 

The appeals to the *Nārāyaṇīya*, which we find particularly in the South Indian scriptural literature, are motivated, undoubtedly, by the desire to locate these works within an ancient and authoritative tradition. In their quest to allign the Pāñcarātra with orthodox Brahminical culture, the authors of the Saṃhitās were greatly helped by the fact that this section of the epic declares itself to be “the great secret teaching” 

\( *mahopaniṣadam*\), “spoken of as the Pañcarātra” \( *pañcarātrānuśabditam*, MBh 12.326.100\). This proclamation alone ensured that the name ‘Pañcarātra’ would always carry a certain prestige, and it is no surprise that several Saṃhitās also describe themselves as *mahopaniṣad* \(e.g. PādS *jp* 1.28, 71 and in the colophons, PārS 10.141, 14.494, 15.987c-989, ĪS 18.514-515 etc.\). As with the allusions to the *Nārāyaṇīya* in the *śāstrāvataraṇa* narratives, the employment in scriptural works of terms such as *mahopaniṣad* indicate that people reading and using these texts were familiar with the *Nārāyaṇīya*. Ordinarily, the authors of these allusions and references are simply “name-dropping”, rather than venturing to engage in any genuine way with the *Nārāyaṇīya*’s content. However, in this chapter I will be addressing a scriptural work of the Pāñcarātra which refers to itself as *mahopaniṣad*, 154 

but whose authors appear to be have been making a genuine attempt to continue, and to bring up to date, the project undertaken by the authors of the *Nārāyaṇīya*.
