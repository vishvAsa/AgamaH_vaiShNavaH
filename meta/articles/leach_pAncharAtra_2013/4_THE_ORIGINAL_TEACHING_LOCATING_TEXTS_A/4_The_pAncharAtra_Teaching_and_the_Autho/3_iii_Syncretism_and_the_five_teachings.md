title = "3 iii \\) Syncretism and the five teachings"

+++

In the passages summarised above, both the AS and the LT adopt a position which is close to that which we find in the *Nārāyaṇīya* itself. In a verse which is subsequently quoted by both Yāmuna \(ĀP 133.6-7\) and Rāmānuja \(see below\), the *Nārāyaṇīya* presents the ‘Pañcarātra’ as a single inclusive system which contains the “Āraṇyaka of the Vedas”, Sāṃkhya and Yoga as “mutually complementary parts”.267 In a 267 MBh 12.336.76abcd: *evam ekaṃ sāṃkhyayogaṃ vedāraṇyakam eva ca */ *parasparaṅgāny etāni* *pañcarātraṃ ca kathyate *//. [[162]]

sectarian religious context, this attitude of “inclusivism” or “tolerance”268 is normally associated, not unfairly, with the Śaiva tradition of the Mantramārga, and with works such as the *Svacchandatantra*, whose appeal that “one should not censure Sāṃkhya, Yoga, the Pāñcarātra and the Veda because they all originate from Śiva, and indeed 

\[all\] grant liberation as their fruit”269 was later quoted approvingly by Abhinavagupta in his *Tantrāloka* \(TĀ\).270 Such an approach stands in stark contrast to that adopted by Yāmuna in his ĀP, wherein the Śaiva scriptures \( *āgama*\), for example, are denounced as being “outside the Veda” \( *vedabāhya*\), and the only motivation of Rudra, their author, is said to be that of “bewildering” those who are qualified for this “corruption” of the Vedic path.271 

Rāmānuja’s attitude towards the other traditions listed in the *Nārāyaṇīya* is more ambiguous. On occasion in his *Śrībhāṣya*, for example, Rāmānuja unequivocally rejects the world-view \( *darśana*\) of the Sāṃkhyas, which he condemns as being “opposed to the Veda” \( *vipratiṣiddhaṃ vedam*, *Śrībhāṣya * on *sūtra* 2.2.9\). He also lists Kapila among the teachers of false doctrines: “It is said that owing to their falsity and because they are outside the Veda, the doctrines of Kapila, Kaṇāda, the Buddha and the Arhat should be ignored by those who desire the highest good.”272 However, elsewhere Rāmānuja remarks that “the view of Kapila, although it is rejected as contrary to scripture and logic, is \[nonetheless\] accepted in part by Vaidikas, on account of such theories as the pre-existence of the effect in the cause.”273 Rāmānuja also has a rather ambiguous attitude towards the Pāśupatas. In his comments on *sūtra* s 2.2.35-38, which draw heavily on Yāmuna’s ĀP \(91.14 *ff*\), 268 See Granoff \(1992: 287 n. 5\), who writes: “On the basis of a limited acquaintance with the Pāñcarātra, I would suspect that the tolerance for other groups displayed in the Northern Śaiva Tantras is not a feature of the Pāñcaratra, which is far more typical of medieval Indian religion in its hostility to the scripture of other groups.” 

269 *Svacchandatantra* 5.44c-45b: *sāṃkhyaṃ yogaṃ pāñcarātraṃ vedāṃś caiva na nindayet *// *yataḥ*

*śivodbhavāḥ sarve hy apavargaphalapradāḥ */. 

270 TĀ 35.36. Abhinavagupta \(TĀ 35.30-37\) argues that the single tradition called ‘Kula’ presents itself in various ways in accordance with the diversity among its followers. 

271 ĀP 98.5-7: *tathā tatraiva bhagavān rudraḥ prastutaśaivādyāgamānāṃ svayam eva vedabāhyatvaṃ*

*vedamārgāpabhraṣṭajanādhikāritvaṃ tad vyāmohaikaprayojanatāṃ ca darśayati*. 

272 *Śrībhāṣya* on *sūtra* 2.2.35 \(327.22-23\): *kapilakaṇādasugatārhatamatānām asāmañjasyāt *\(corr. 

*asāmaṃjasyāt*\) *vedabāhyatvāc ca niśśreyasārthibhir anādaraṇīyatvam uktam.*

273 *Śrībhāṣya* on *sūtra* 2.2.16 \(315.19-20\): *kapilapakṣasya śrutinyāyavirodhaparityaktasyāpi* *satkāryavādādinā kvacid aṃśe vaidikaiḥ parigraho ’sti.*[[163]]

the doctrine of Paśupati \( *paśupatimata*\) is denounced as being contrary to the Veda \( *vedaviruddha*, e.g. at *Śrībhāṣya * 329.11-12\), and akin to the doctrines of Kapila and Kaṇāda et al., insofar as it is false \( *asāmañjasya*\) and to be ignored \( *anādaraṇīya*, *Śrībhāṣya* 327.23-328.1\). Here, the followers of Paśupati are criticised both for their theological and soteriological teachings, and for their religious practices. However, in his comments on *sūtra * 2.2.42, wherein the validity of the Pañcarātra system \( *tantra*\) is argued for, and the *Nārāyaṇīya* appealed to on several occasions, Rāmānuja approaches the Pāśupata, as well as Sāṃkhya and Yoga, with a different perspective.274 Thus, quoting the aforementioned MBh 12.336.76, Rāmānuja explains that Sāṃkhya, Yoga, the Vedas and the Āraṇyakas all constitute “the one Pañcarātra”, and that they are all devoted to propounding a single truth.275 Rāmānuja elaborates on this claim as follows: 

*sāṅkhyoktāni pañcaviṃśatitattvāni, yogoktaṃ ca yamaniyamādyātmakaṃ*

*yogaṃ, vedoditakarmasvarūpāṇy aṅgīkṛtya tattvānāṃ brahmātmakatvaṃ,* *yogasya ca brahmopāsanaprakāratvaṃ karmaṇāṃ ca tadārādhanarūpatām* *abhidadhati, brahmasvarūpaṃ pratipādayanty āraṇyakāni */ *etad eva pareṇa* *brahmaṇā nārāyaṇena svayam eva paṃcarātratantre viśadīkṛtam – iti */

*mahopaniṣadaṃ caturvedasamanvitam */ *sāṃkhyayogakṛtaṃ tena pañcarātrānuśabditam*\), Rāmānuja identifies the terms ‘Sāṃkhya’ and ‘Yoga’ as referring to, respectively, the yoga of knowledge \( *jñānayoga*\) and the yoga of action \( *karmayoga*\). He cites the *Bhagavadgītā* \(3.3cd\) in support of this \( *Śrībhāṣya* 333.11-12\). Conversely, in his comments on *sūtra* s 2.2.1-2.2.9, Rāmānuja explicitly identifies ‘Sāṃkhya’ with the *Sāṃkhyakārikā*, from which he quotes a number of times. The question as to “which” Sāṃkhya Rāmānuja is referring in his commentary on 2.2.42 is beyond the scope of the present work, but suffice to say that it should not necessarily be assumed that he intends the 

‘Sāṃkhya’ of the *Sāṃkhyakārikā * and its commentaries. 

275 *Śrībhāṣya* \(334.16-18\): *sāṅkhyaṃ ca yogaś ca sāṅkhyayogam, vedāś cāraṇyakāni ca* *vedāraṇyakam, parasparāṅgāny etāni, ekatattvapratipādanaparatayaikībhūtāni ekaṃ paṃcarātram* *iti kathyate*. Note that Rāmānuja takes *vedāraṇyakam* here to be a *samāhāradvandva* compound. As is indicated in my above reading of MBh 12.336.76, I take *vedāraṇyakam* in the *Nārāyaṇīya* to be a *tatpuruṣa* compound. This, I believe, is supported by MBh 12.331.2-3, where we find \(at 3c\) a reference to “the Āraṇyaka from the Vedas” \( *āraṇyakaṃ ca vedebhyaḥ*\). The context here implies that the Āraṇyaka is the best part of the Vedas. [[164]]

follows\]: they explain the principles \[of Sāṃkhya\] as having *brahman* as their nature, Yoga as a method of meditation upon *brahman*, and the rites \[of the Veda\] as consisting of the worship of *that* \(i.e. *brahman*\). This, indeed, has been explained by Nārāyaṇa, himself the supreme *brahman*, in the Pañcarātra system. 

In the *Śārīraka* \(i.e. the *Brahmasūtra*\), the principles spoken of in Sāṃkhya are rejected only insofar as \[they are\] not \[described as\] having the nature of *brahman*. It is not \[the principles which are rejected\] *per se*. And in Yoga and Pāśupata, it is the Lord’s being merely the instrumental cause \[of creation\], the contradictory notions regarding the true essence of the totality of existence, and the conduct outlawed by the Veda that are rejected. It is not \[that\] Yoga and Paśupati \[are rejected\] *per se*. Thus it is said, ‘Sāṃkhya, Yoga, Pañcarātra, the Vedas, and Pāśupata: these are the valid means of knowledge with regard to *ātman*, and they cannot be destroyed by logical arguments.’ \[Therefore\] the bare essentials of each of the \[world-views\] set forth in these various \[systems\] are to be accepted. It is said \[therefore\] that not everything \[in these systems\] is to be rejected, as is the case with the \[schemes of\] reality set forth by the Jina and the Buddha.” \( *Śrībhāṣya* 334.18-335.2\) 

It is worth quoting Rāmānuja *in extenso* on the subject of Sāṃkhya, Yoga and the Pāśupata in order to highlight the differences between his own approach to these traditions and that which is found in the AS and the LT. Rāmānuja is especially critical of Sāṃkhya and the Pāśupata, and is accepting of these traditions’ ontological and theological systems only when they are radically reinterpreted so as to conform to his own Vaiṣṇava Vedāntin outlook. As he says himself, “the reality of \[each\] 

principle such as *pradhāna*, *puruṣa* and *paśupati* that is taught in these systems is to be accepted only insofar as \[that reality\] is \[recognised as\] being identical with Nārāyaṇa, who is the supreme *brahman* known from the Vedānta.”276 

The claim in the *Nārāyaṇīya*, the AS and the LT that Nārāyaṇa or Lakṣmī is the culmination or goal \( *niṣṭhā*\) of each of these traditions is also, of course, a 

“sectarian” re-reading of other soteriological systems, and can be justly interpreted as an attempt to include and thereby subordinate these alternative paths within an all-encompassing Vaiṣṇava *dharma*. A very similar strategy, albeit one without any obvious link to the *Nārāyaṇīya*, can be found in a short passage of the JS.277 It is 276 *Śrībhāṣya * on *sūtra* 2.2.42 \(334.5-6\): * tattantrābhihitapradhānapuruṣapaśupatiprabhṛtitattvasya* *vedāntavedyaparabrahmabhūtanārāyaṇātmakatayaiva *\[corr. *nārāyaṇatmakatayaiva*\] * vastutvam* *abhyupagamanīyam*.

notable that, unlike Rāmānuja, both the AS and the LT include Buddhist and Jain traditions, and also the Cārvākas or Lokāyatas within their inclusive framework: *sa eva sarvabhūtānāṃ sraṣṭā pālayitāntakaḥ */ *sa eva śivarūpeṇa śaivair* *ārādhyate prabhuḥ *// *sa eva brahmarūpeṇa sṛjaty etac carācaram */ *sa eva* *pālayaty etad viṣṇur bhūtvā janārdanaḥ *// *sa eva rudrarūpeṇa saṃharaty* *akhilaṃ jagat */ *buddhātmanā ca bauddhānāṃ sa eva jagati sthitaḥ *// *sa* *evāśāmbarāṇāṃ* \(corr. *eva śāmbarāṇāṃ*\) * ca nirāvaraṇarūpadhṛt */ *sa eva* *cārvākamate*

For Buddhists \( *bauddha*\), he exists in the world in the form of the Buddha, and for those who are sky-clad \( *āśāmbara*, i.e. the Digambaras\) he has an unveiled form. According to the doctrine of the Cārvākas, he has the form of the Lord of the Jinas. For the sacrificers he is called Yajñapūruṣa, and it is said that he is worshipped as this by the Mīmāṃsakas.

25.39-44\) 

While these passages may be cited as good examples of “inclusivism” in Paul Hacker’s sense of the term,278 they cannot be said to be genuinely syncretistic. 

However, elsewhere in the AS and the LT, we do encounter genuine attempts to appropriate and integrate the four traditions \(Veda, Sāṃkhya, Yoga, Pāśupata\) listed alongside the Pañcarātra in the *Nārāyaṇīya*. As we have seen in previous chapters, it is not unusual for Pāñcarātra scriptures to incorporate Vedic rites and mantras into their own rituals, as the AS and the LT do, as has been noted above. The AS’s \(15.26 *ff*\) orthodox account of the four social classes \( *varṇa*\) and stages of life \( *āśrama*\) is not particularly striking either, for much the same reason. Nor is its decree that the initiate \( *śiṣya*\) must be a member of the twice-born classes \(AS 

20.8d\), or the LT’s \(21.30d\) assertion that the preceptor \( *ācārya*\) should be a Brahmin who is “thoroughly learned in the Veda” \( *vedapāragaḥ*\), though such restrictions may well support the argument that neither of these works are as old as was previously held. However, what is more striking is that both of these texts also openly appropriate, integrate and legitimate ideas and nomenclature from Sāṃkhya, Yoga and Śaiva sources. 

Thus, the AS’s seventh chapter on the “impure creation” \( *śuddhetarasṛṣṭi*\) begins by acknowledging its reliance on the evolutionary scheme propounded by the Sāṃkhyas.279 In the same work, ‘Yoga’ is presented as commensurate with the 

“internal worship” or “sacrifice in the heart” \( *hṛdyāga*, *hṛdayārādhana*, AS 31.2 *ff*\) that we find described in other Saṃhitās. Here, in contrast to the act of “advancing” 

or “engaging” \( *pravartakakarman*\), which is said to lead to fruits such as heaven \( *svargādiphala*\), Yoga or internal worship is called *nivartakakarman*, the act of 

“turning away” or “disengaging”, and is said to lead to liberation \( *mokṣa*\) \(AS 31.13-278 For Hacker \(1995: 244\), “inclusivism” consists “in claiming for, and thus including in, one’s own religion what really belongs to an alien sect”. Halbfass \(1995: 11\) further characterises Hacker’s notion of inclusivism as “a subordinating identification of other teachings with parts or preliminary stages of one’s own religious system, which is thus presented as a superior structure”. 

279 AS 7.1: *anyūnānatiriktaṃ yad guṇasāmyaṃ tamomayam */ *tat sāṃkhyair jagato mūlaṃ prakṛtiś* *ceti kathyate *//. [[167]]

14\). The eight limbs \( *aṣṭāṅga*\) of Yoga, by which the individual self \( *jīvātman*\) achieves conjunction \( *saṃyoga*\) with the supreme self \( *paramātman*\) \(AS 31.15\), are then described in detail \(AS 31.18-32.76\). These are the same eight limbs we find enumerated in the *Yogasūtra*, though the descriptions of each one differ here. At the end of the AS, the author claims to have “reflected thoroughly on the methods of Sāṃkhya and Yoga”.280 The LT, meanwhile, adopts a similar position with regard to these traditions, and frequently legitimates both as effective soteriological methods alongside the Pāñcarātra and the Veda \(e.g. LT 13.12-13b, 15.17, 17.9-13, 32.17\). 

Alexis Sanderson \(2001: 35-38\) has shown that both the AS and the LT also incorporate ideas and terminology from North Indian Śaiva scriptural sources. I do not need to repeat Sanderson’s findings here, or to list the substantial text-parallels he has found between the LT and several Kashmirian works. It is worth emphasising, however, that these processes of appropriation and inclusion are deliberately *open* in these works. For example, in the AS \(14.14-20\) we are told that at the beginning of creation, Viṣṇu’s discus-form Sudarśana manifests as five powers \( *śakti*\), one of which, namely the power of concealment \( *tirodhāna*\), causes the embodied selves \( *jīva*\) to be tainted by “three impurities” \( *malatrayam*\). As Schrader \(1916: 115\) has observed, these “three impurities” are not the same as those presented in a number of Śaiva scriptures, rather they bear a close resemblance to three of the five so-called 

“sheaths” \( *kañcuka*\) which are listed in several works of the Śaiva Mantramārga. 

However, it is notable that at AS 11.45ab the five powers \( *śaktipañcaka*\) and the three impurities \( *malatraya*\) are named together as doctrines of the Pāśupata.281 

Elsewhere, at the end of the presentation of the five teachings which have evolved out of the original teaching \( *ādiśāstra*\), it is said that Sudarśana, having divided himself into five, has “five faces” \( *pañcavaktragaḥ*\).282 This is a very common epithet of Śiva. Though it is also applied to Viṣṇu elsewhere in the Pāñcarātra 280 AS 60.17ab: *sāṃkhyayogavidhir yatra kārtsnyena paricintyate */. Cf. the final *śloka* of the *Nārāyaṇīya* \(MBh 12.339.21\), in which Brahmā claims to have answered the preceding questions in conformity with Sāṃkhya and Yoga: *etat te kathitaṃ putra yathāvad anupṛcchataḥ */ *sāṃkhyajñāne* *tathā yoge yathāvad anuvarṇitam *//. 

281 The association of the doctrine of the “three impurities” with the Pāśupata is also made at AS 

55.13-14. 

282 AS 11.64c-65b: *sudarśanāhvayo yo ’sau saṃkalpo vaiṣṇavaḥ paraḥ *// *sa svayaṃ bibhide tena* *pañcadhā pañcavaktragaḥ */. [[168]]

literature, in these texts god is more frequently characterised as having *four* faces, corresponding to his four Vyūha forms. In another passage, the highest principles of the Pāśupata doctrine, as well as those of Sāṃkhya and Yoga, are said to be denoted by the *praṇava* *oṃ*, which refers at the same time to Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Śiva \(AS 

51.39-42\). 

The AS, moreover, explicitly adverts to its syncretist agenda. In its opening chapter, the text describes itself as “a union of the different Siddhāntas embellished with 

the 

various 

\[branches 

of\] 

knowledge” 

\( *nānāsiddhāntasaṃbhedā*

*nānāvidyopaśobhitā*, AS 1.70ab\). The term *siddhānta* is used in the AS to designate not the separate traditions *within* the Pāñcarātra, on which this text says nothing, but rather the five traditions which are founded in the original teaching \( *ādiśāstra*\). At AS 15.6cd it is claimed that these five Siddhāntas are “highly esteemed by everyone” 

\( *sarvasaṃmatāḥ*\). In the preceding chapter, the paths \( *mārga*\) by which “the abode of Viṣṇu” \( *sthānaṃ vaiṣṇavam*\) can be reached include Sāṃkhya, Yoga, Vedānta and the observance of “terrible austerities” \( *ugravratadharaḥ*\), which I take to mean the Pāśupata.283 These paths may be followed both on their own and conjointly \( *saṃhatair vigṛhītaiś ca*\) \(AS 14.39-40\). In its closing chapters, meanwhile, the AS 

describes itself as a “compendium” \( *saṃhitā*\), “immersed in the various Śāstras” 

\( *nānāśāstrāvagāhinī*, AS 59.69cd\), “consisting of Sāṃkhya and Yoga etc.” 

\( *sāṃkhyayogādisaṃmitā*, AS 59.70b\), and as “the essence of the Tantras” 

\( *tantrasāra*, AS 60.20cd\). 

Such pronouncements should not obscure the fact that the AS presents the Pañcarātra as being superior to the other four Śāstras. It speaks in one passage, for instance, of the possibility of the followers of the Vedas and Sāṃkhya etc. 

“ascending” \( *ārohanti*\), if they desire it, to the Sāttvata teaching \(AS 15.21c-22b\). In another passage, the Vedas, Sāṃkhya and Pāśupata are described as providing 

“mediate” \( *vyavadhānataḥ*, AS 13.17b\) or “indirect” \( *parokṣam*, AS 13.25c\) knowledge \(of god, and of the means to *mokṣa*\), and this is contrasted with the 

“direct” \( *sākṣāt*\) knowledge provided by the Pāñcarātra \(AS 13.21c-22\). And it is the Pañcarātra Śāstra alone among the five systems of knowledge that is said to contain 283 In the *Nārāyaṇīya* \(MBh 12.328.18c\) Rudra is called *ugravratadharaḥ*. [[169]]

the essence \( *sāra*\) of the original teaching \(AS 11.62c-63b\). However, on the cosmological plane the five teachings are situated at the same level, for they are the manifestations of “the word” \( *śabda*\), which in this text is presented, as Schrader \(1916: 107-108\) notes, as one of Sudarśana’s “regulative powers” \( *pramāṇa*\) \(see e.g. AS 11.2\), i.e. the means by which the periods between cosmic creation and dissolution are structured and maintained. In this context the AS calls the five teachings the “primordial elements” \( *etāni pañca śāstrāṇi mūlabhūtāni*\) which, by Viṣṇu’s will \( *saṃkalpa*\), are separated from each other in every Cosmic Age \( *yuga*\) \(AS 12.49\). **

The LT does not present itself as a compendium of other Śāstras, or as encompassing the teachings of Veda, Sāṃkhya, Yoga and Pāśupata in the consistent manner of the AS. Nonetheless, in addition to the verses quoted above wherein Lakṣmī is presented as the “goal” \( *niṣṭhā*\) of the five traditions \(LT 1.41c-43b\), we also find it said of “the yogin who is intent upon meditating on Tārikā”, that he is 

“eagerly engaged in the \[Vedic\] rites, he is a Sāṃkhya, a Yogin, a Sāttvata and a Pāśupata.”284 And at the very end of the LT, it is determined that the one who is fit to receive the teaching must, among other accomplishments, know the method of Yoga together with its limbs \( *sāṅgayogavidhāna*\), the Vedas and Vedāṅgas, and the doctrine of Paśupati \(LT 57.52c-53b\). 

Like the AS, the LT draws on the non-dual philosophy of Kashmirian Śaiva traditions, wherein “reality” is viewed as nothing but the unbounded, dynamic consciousness of Śiva. The AS and the LT’s markedly tolerant and inclusive approach to other religious systems can be seen in many ways as the inevitable consequence of such a philosophy, for all teachings must be admitted as ultimately deriving from the same source.285 Thus, the nominal inclusion, as we have seen, of even Buddhist, Jain and Cārvaka or Lokāyata traditions, and the LT’s claim, when speaking of Śāstra, that “the supreme good is accessible everywhere”: 284 LT 40.118-119a: *evaṃ yo vartate yogī tārikāmananodyataḥ */ *sa karmaṭhaḥ sa vai sāṃkhyaḥ sa* *yogī sa ca sāttvataḥ *// *sa ca pāśupato jñeyaḥ*… //. 

285 Non-Saiddhāntika Śaiva philosophers such as Abhinavagupta avoided the potential relativism of the claim that all Śāstras are valid because they are all manifestations of Śiva’s consciousness by employing a variety of arguments which attempted to justify the ordering of God’s revelation into a hierarchy \(see e.g. Hanneder 1998\). There is no such systematic presentation in the AS or the LT. [[170]]

He must follow all Siddhāntas perfectly in order to attain *ātman*. \[This means\] being free from attachment and aversion, and with his mind free from desire. He should neither mentally nor verbally condemn the Śāstras, whether high or low, \[and\] he should accept their content entirely insofar as it is related to *ātman*. All Śāstras are deployed \( *tanvate*\) for the benefit of living beings… The venerable Nārāyaṇa is described \[in them\] in many different ways. Abiding in Nārāyaṇa, I am all-seeing and all-knowing, resembling a physician who knows the cause of diseases. Embodying this and that particular guru etc., I assuredly divulge the various different Śāstras \[each of which\] is a source of knowledge that is adapted to \[one’s own particular\] 

capacity. \[Therefore\] no Śāstra should ever be rejected completely. Whether it be abundant or scarce, the supreme good is accessible everywhere. Therefore, insofar as one must take refuge in \[one\] teaching \( *artha*\), there should no contempt \[for another teaching\].” \(LT 28.29-31, 33-36\) 

Although the AS and the LT are both very probably South Indian in origin, when formulating their understanding of Śāstra and locating their own texts within that compass, the authors of these works looked to the non-dualism of Kashmirian Śaiva philosophers rather than to the “differentiated non-dualism” of Rāmānuja and his Śrīvaiṣṇava tradition. This is despite the fact that both works elsewhere show the influence of the latter \(see especially AS 37.22-35b, as noted by Rastelli 2004, and LT 16.42-44, 17.38-64, 28.9-16\). Indeed it is striking, and hardly coincidental, that these texts’ only references to the soteriological *ineffectiveness* of Sāṃkhya and Yoga occur among the passages just cited \(i.e. AS 37.25-26, LT 17.49-50, 63\) – in other words, alongside expressions of devotion which appear to bear the influence of Śrīvaiṣṇava thought. 

Where, then, can we locate the syncretistic AS and LT within the textual history of the Pāñcarātra? Both works clearly borrow from the *Nārāyaṇīya* the device of integrating the four traditions Veda, Sāṃkhya, Yoga and Pāśupata within a 171 

Pāñcarātra framework. However, it is also evident that a syncretistic Pāñcarātra tradition existed in Kashmir before the composition of the AS and the LT, for it is represented there in the c. tenth century *Spandapradīpikā* \(SpPr\) of Bhagavadutpala. 

Like the AS and the LT, this work draws heavily on non-dual Śaiva philosophy, quoting profusely from Śaiva scriptural and post-scriptural works, as well as, for example, from Vāmanadatta’s *Saṃvitprakāśa*,286 several Pañcarātra scriptures, the Upaniṣads, Ānandavardhana’s *Dhvanyāloka*, Bhartṛhari, Nāgārjuna, Dignāga, and other unnamed Buddhist sources.287 Of more relevance, at least with regard to the AS, we find the five traditions of the *Nārāyaṇīya* listed together in another work composed in Kashmir, or in “the sphere of Kashmir’s cultural influence” \(Sanderson 2009a: 105\), towards the end of the first millennium, namely the *Viṣṇudharmottarapurāṇa* \(VDhP\). In this work, Sāṃkhya, Yoga, the Pañcarātra, the Vedas and the Pāśupata are listed together as the five “doctrines” \( *kṛtānta*\)288 

alongside, in one case fourteen \(VDhP 1.74.32-35b\), and in another case eighteen \(VDhP 2.22.128-134b\), traditional branches of knowledge \( *vidyā*\). In the verse following the first passage, the VDhP asserts that “the Dharmas of Viṣṇu \(i.e. the *Viṣṇudharmāḥ*\), together with their additions, have proclaimed this \(i.e. the VDhP\) to be the essence \(i.e. of the fourteen branches of knowledge and the five doctrines\)” 

\( *sottarā vaiṣṇavā dharmās sāram etat prakīrtitam*, VDhP 1.74.35cd\). In other words, the VDhP, like the AS, presents itself here as the summation of the entire available breadth of “authentic” knowledge, and this consists of the traditional branches of learning \( *vidyā*, or elsewhere *vidyāsthāna*\) together with Sāṃkhya, Yoga, Pañcarātra and Pāśupata. The AS \(1.70ab\), recall, claims to be a “union” of these teachings. 

286 Numerous passages from this work are also incorporated into the LT \(see Sanderson 2001: 36 n. 

46\). 

287 The SpPr, the printed edition of which runs only to 58 pages, quotes directly from other texts 222 

times, with over 40 different works cited. Bhagavadutpala states in the introductory section that the philosophical viewpoint \( *darśana*\) of the *Spandakārikā*, on which he is commentating, is non-dual \( *advaita*\). This viewpoint is “its own system” \( *idaṃ darśanaṃ svatantram*\), writes Bhagavadutpala, and all Śāstras which teach non-dualism conform with it \( *sarvaśāstrasamudbhūtaṃ*

*cādvaitapratipādakatvaṃ nirbādham eva*, SpPr 6.10-11\). 

288 See Yāmuna’s, Rāmānuja’s, and Vedāntadeśika’s quotation of MBh 12.326.100cd at, respectively, ĀP 107.1-2, *Śrībhāṣya* 333.8-9, and PRR 2.8-10: *idaṃ mahopaniṣadaṃ caturvedasamanvitam */ 

*sāṃkhyayogakṛtāntena pañcarātrānuśabditam *//. MBh 12.326.100cd reads: *sāṃkhyayogakṛtaṃ tena* *pañcarātrānuśabditam* //. [[172]]

In the second *khaṇḍa* of the VDhP, four subsidiary Vedas – Itihāsa \(narratives which tell of “the way things were”\), Dhanurveda \(weaponry\), Gandharva \(music, dance and drama\), and Āyurveda \(medicine\) – are added to the list of the fourteen *vidyā* s \(i.e. the four Vedas and six Vedāṅgas, Mīmāṃsā, Nyāya, Dharmaśāstra and Purāṇa\), and named alongside the five “doctrines”.289 The same verses are contained in the *Agnipurāṇa* \(219.57c-61\), and their content is reflected in the 12th chapter of the AS, wherein the chief fields of enquiry and application of the five systems Veda, Sāṃkhya, Yoga, Pañcarātra, and Pāśupata are enumerated, and the Veda is shown to consist of 21 subdivisions \( *bheda*\). Here \(at AS 12.6c-16\), the disciplines of architecture, planning and construction \( *vāstu*\), governance \( *daṇḍanīti*\), and agriculture and commerce \( *vārtā*, though normally *vārttā*\) are added to the eighteen branches of knowledge named in the second *khaṇḍa* of the VDhP.290 The listing in the VDhP of the traditional branches of knowledge alongside the five systems named together in the *Nārāyaṇīya* may well be sufficiently broad in its scope to qualify as a relatively early formulation of the disciplines and traditions which would later collectively be called “Hinduism”. Although the AS’s syncretistic world-view, aiming to incorporate and encapsulate all traditions of “authentic knowledge”, is rare among the scriptural works of the Pāñcarātra, it is not unprecedented in Vaiṣṇava literature. 

289 VDhP 2.22.128-134b: *mahendro malayaḥ sahyaḥ śuktimān ṛkṣavāṃs tathā* / *vindhyaś ca* *pāriyātraś ca sarva* *eva mahīdharāḥ* // *samāgamyābhiṣiñcantu tvām adya vasudhādhipa* / 

*ṛgvedo’tha yajurvedaḥ* *sāmavedas tathaiva ca* // *atharvavedo vedās tvām abhiṣiñcantu pārthiva* / 

*itihāso dhanurvedo gandharvaś cāyussaṃjñitaḥ* // *vedopavedāś ca tathā vijayāya bhavantu te* / 

*śikṣā kalpo vyākaraṇaṃ niruktaṃ* *jyotiṣāṅgatiḥ* // *chandovicitiṣaṣthāni vijayaḥ pradiśantu te* / 

*aṅgāni vedāś catvāro mīmāṃsā nyāyavistaraḥ* // *dharmaśāstraṃ purāṇañ ca vidyā etāś caturdaśa* / 

*sāṃkhyayogaḥ pañcarātraṃ vedāḥ pāśupataṃ tathā* // *kṛtāntapañcakaṃ *\[corr. *kṛtānnapañcakaṃ*\] *hy* *etac chāstrāṇi vividhāni ca* /. 

290 According to Krishnamacharya \(1986: 106\), the editor of the revised edition of the AS, verses 15-16 are omitted in one manuscript. In these verses *vāstuveda*, *dhanurveda*, *gāndharva* and *āyurveda* are listed as four of the five Upavedas, and it is claimed that there are 21 divisions in total. These verses may be a later interpolation, and they pose something of a problem in that if there are indeed five Upavedas, then Itihāsa and Purāṇa \(at 14a\) must count together as one, but if this is the case then the AS only enumerates 20 divisions as opposed to 21. It is possible that a re-worker may have identified *arthāḥ* at AS 12.13a as referring to the *Arthaśāstra*. [[173]]
