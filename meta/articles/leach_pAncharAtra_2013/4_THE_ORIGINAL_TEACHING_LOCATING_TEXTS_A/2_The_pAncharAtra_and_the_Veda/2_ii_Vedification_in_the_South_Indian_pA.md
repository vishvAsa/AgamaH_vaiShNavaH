title = "2 ii \\) “Vedification” in the South Indian Pāñcarātra"

+++

In an article devoted to the referent of the term *dharma* in the Dharmasūtras, Albrecht Wezler \(2004\) explores the manner in which “the *dharma* of the Dharmaśāstra” is presented as having been “extracted” from the Veda. Addressing the opening two verses of the *Gautamadharmasūtra *\(GDh\), Wezler argues that there is a clear distinction presupposed between the Vedic *dharma*, on the one hand, and 

“the *dharma* of the Dharmaśāstra” on the other. It is the latter, says Wezler, to which Gautama refers in the phrase “the Veda is the root of *dharma*” \( *vedo dharmamūlam*, GDh 1.1\). According to Wezler, this statement, together with the second verse, which he translates as “and tradition as well as practice of those who know it \(that is, the Veda\), \[are the root of *dharma*\]”, is a clear sign of a process of “Vedification”, which he explains as meaning “in the first place the development of the *vedamūlatva* concept” \(ibid.: 643-644\). 

209 See SanS *Brahmarātra * 4.68c-73, *Ṛṣirātra * 5.30c-40b, 7.1-73, 9.7-10, 22-24 etc. 

210 MārkS 1.26ab: *teṣv ayaṃ mantrasiddhānto mārkaṇḍeyākhya īritaḥ *// - “Among these \[Saṃhitās\], this which is named Mārkaṇḍeya is said to be \[a teaching of\] the Mantrasiddhānta.” [[120]]

“Vedification” is a useful term to apply to the processes at work in the South Indian Pāñcarātra scriptures which I have listed above. Inevitably, when applied to this much later literature, the concept of “Vedification” carries quite different implications from those intended by Wezler, for by the time of the composition of these works the term ‘Veda’ had a substantially broader scope of reference than in Gautama’s day. The enlargement of the Vedic canon in the intervening centuries was itself, of course, largely an outcome of the application of the *vedamūlatva* principle \(see especially Halbfass 1991 and Pollock 1997\). Needless to say, when I use Wezler’s term in reference to the Pāñcarātra, I do not mean to identify the ‘Veda’ of the Dharmasūtras with the broader body of texts and practices by means of which the authors of the later Pāñcarātra Saṃhitās attempted to establish the legitimacy of their tradition. 

Of course, we can see processes of Vedification in operation already in the earliest Saṃhitās, especially in certain formal features of the texts themselves and also in their incorporation of Vedic rituals into the daily practice of initiates. 

However, as we have seen, these works \(I am thinking specifically here of the JS, SS 

and PauṣS\) do not establish their own authority on the grounds that they are “rooted in the Veda”. The Pāñcarātrika method of accommodating or appropriating Vedic practices was no doubt intended to enhance its credibility in the eyes of outsiders, and to present Pāñcarātrika forms of worship as continuous with the more orthoprax systems. But the texts themselves, in their narrative portions, do not locate their own tradition within the Veda, or even as based upon it, as the later Saṃhitās do. Rather, Vedic practice, on the rare occasions it is explicitly identified as such, is presented as preliminary to, and subordinate to, a higher system of Viṣṇu worship. 

The idea that the Pāñcarātra way of worship is superior to the Veda because it is soteriologically effective is clearly present among the later South Indian Pāñcarātra traditions which enjoin “mixed worship”, and it can still be found in their scriptures. 

Thus, in the opening chapter of the PādS \( *jp* 1.92d-93\), in a verse referred to previously, it is expressly said that the Pañcarātra can grant liberation whereas the Veda \(“the tree which possesses the Kalpasūtras”\) cannot. However, this verse is followed very quickly by the qualifier “there is no teaching superior to the Veda” [[121]]

\( *vedaśāstrāt paraṃ nāsti*, PādS *jp* 1.96c\). Such proclamations of deference towards the Veda, which seem rather perfunctory at times, and may have been added later in the last case, can be found increasingly often in the younger works. For example, clear signs of Vedification are evident in the NārS, a work which is quoted by Vedāntadeśika, and which therefore very probably predates such scriptures as the ĪS, ŚrīprśS, ViśS, MārkS, ViṣṇuS and ŚrīpurS.211 The NārS teaches that the Pāñcarātra mantras are themselves Vedic: “Those mantras which are revealed here in the Pañcarātra, they are all known to be Vedic. This secret called ‘Pāñcarātra’ is certainly Vedic, and the path of the Veda is manifested \[here\]”.212 However, this verse occurs only very shortly after another in which the NārS rules that “whatever is not spoken of in detail \[here\], with regard to the \[ *saṃskāra* s\] beginning with the impregnation rite, that should always be performed by the wise according to the path which is taught in the Veda”.213 This clearly gives priority to the Pāñcarātra system, or to the NārS itself, since the earlier part of this chapter \(NārS 29.1-36b\) explains in detail how the life-cycle rites \( *saṃskāra*\) should be performed. Of course, the inclusion of such passages is itself a sign of Vedification, but the implicit instruction here is that the NārS’s injunctions should replace those of the Veda, and that the latter should be consulted only for additional information.214 This is counter to the position that was later taken up by Vedāntadeśika, namely that Pāñcarātrika rites are valid only when they address matters, such as the installation and worship of Viṣṇu’s icon in a temple, which are not contained in the Veda \(PRR 21.7 *ff*\). 

There are, to be sure, different degrees of Vedification. The Veda is frequently praised as the highest teaching in the late South Indian Pāñcarātra works, but often such claims appear to be doing little more than paying lip service or, as 211 Vedāntadeśika cites a ‘Nāradīya’ on four occasions in his PRR. None of the verses quoted are found in the printed edition of the NārS, but on the first occasion \(at PRR 16.19-20\) the quoted verses are addressed to Gautama. Gautama is, along with Nārada, the principal interlocutor of the present version of the NārS. This makes it quite likely, then, that Vedāntadeśika had access to a different version of the same work. 

212 NārS 29.39-40b: *atra mantrās tu ye kecit pañcarātre prakāśitāḥ */ *te sarve vaidikāḥ jñeyāḥ*

*rahasyaṃ vaidikaṃ tv idam *// *pāñcarātram iti khyātaṃ vedādhvaprakaṭīkṛtam */. 

213 NārS 29.36c-37b: *niṣekādiṣu sarvatra yad yad uktam avistaram *// *vedoditena mārgeṇa tat tat* *kāryaṃ vipaścitā */. 

214 Elsewhere, the NārS states that *either* the Vedic *or* the Pāñcarātrika life-cycle rites should be performed. NārS 11.81: *niṣekādyāṃs tu saṃskārān vaidikāṃs tu samācaret */ *pāñcarātroditān vāpi* *evaṃ vaṃśair *\(corr. *vaṃśer*\) * anuṣṭhitān *//. [[122]]

Louis Renou \(1960: 2\) has characterised such conventions, as offering “*un simple*

*‘coup de chapeau’ en passant*”. A good example of such an attitude is found in the ViśS \(3.2-6b\), where it is said that the Pāñcarātrika guru should be a Brahmin who is learned not only in the Vedas together with their auxiliary limbs \( *sāṅgavedavit*\), but also in the Nyāyaśastra, Vaiśeṣika, Mīmāṃsā, Sāṃkhya, Yoga, Vedānta, and in the discipline of architecture, planning and construction \( *vāstuśāstra*\). There are many similar passages in other works, which I do not need to list here. But we also encounter what we might interpret as more “genuine” processes of Vedification. A good example of this can be found in the ViṣṇuS’s assertion that the initiate should always perform what is stipulated in the Dharmaśāstra in his own home, and that what is spoken of in the Tantras is in conformity with the laws relating to family \(or clan, *kula*\), social class \( *varṇa*\), and stage of life \( *āśrama*\).215 Needless to say, this idea of the equivalence between Tantra and Dharmaśāstra, and the injunction for the initiate to adhere to the domestic rules of the latter, represents a somewhat radical revision of the SS’s earlier claim, referred to above, that the Dharmaśāstra is only for those who have not undergone initiation \( *dīkṣā*\). According to this prescription in the ViṣṇuS, then, initiation into the Pāñcarātra would not disturb one’s daily duties as a householder – a pledge which was no doubt intended to appeal to an audience who wished to maintain their Smārta obligations. 

Perhaps the most telling indicator of genuine Vedification is the gradual change in scriptural attitudes towards social class \( *varṇa*\). In the earliest of the published Saṃhitās, the JS, SS and PauṣS, there are several passages which attest to a relatively open, socially inclusive policy regarding initiation and participation in the post-initiatory rites. In all three texts, initiation is unambiguously open to members of all four *varṇa* s as well as to women. The JS states that “the whole world should be initiated\!” \( *dīkṣayen medinīṃ sarvam*, JS 16.10a\), and this is shown to include “pure-minded” \( *bhāvitātman*\) women and children \(JS 16.2ab\). In the case of women this appears to mean that they must be virgins \( *kanyakā*, JS 16.59c\), of whom it is said that they are only able to undergo the intitiation which grants “enjoyments” \( *bhoga*\) 215 ViṣṇuS 29.68: *svagṛhye dharmaśāstre ca yaduktam tat sadācaret */ *tantroktam aviruddhaṃ ca* *kulavarṇāśramānugam *//. [[123]]

and “perfections” \( *siddhi*, JS 16.82\) i.e. not liberation. Eligibility for initiation does not extend to the offspring of *pratiloma* marriages, i.e. wherein the man is of a lower social class than the woman \(JS 18.19ab\). Regarding the role of preceptor \( *ācārya*\), the JS \(18.5c-9\) rules that he should be a Brahmin, but that in the absence of a Brahmin, a Kṣatriya is competent to initiate Kṣatriyas, Vaiśyas and Śūdras, while in the absence of a Kṣatriya, a Vaiśya may initiate Vaiśyas and Śūdras. A Śūdra, meanwhile, may initiate other Śūdras. In the JS’s chapter on the rites of reparation \( *prāyaścitta*\), however, we meet with a more orthodox attitude towards social class. 

Here, for example, a reparation rite is enjoined if one has eaten food that has been touched by a village hog, a vulture, a jackal, a monkey, a cockerel or a Śūdra – the 

“leftovers” of any of these are considered “contaminated”.216 The same chapter prescribes the repetition of mantras \( *japa*\) as reparation for the intentional or unintentional killing of a woman, Śūdra or child \( *strīśūdrabālakān hatvā…*, JS 

25.108\), and for entering the home of a Caṇḍāla, a washerman \( *rajaka*\) or a leather worker \( *carmakāra*, JS 25.109c-112b\).217 

The present versions of the SS and the PauṣS do not contain similar passages on the reparation rites. Nor do they state that a Śūdra may act as preceptor to other Śūdras, but both clearly state that initiation is open to members of all four *varṇa* s \(e.g. SS 16.17-22, 19.42-45, PauṣS 1.35ab, 38.72\), and both allow that women can be initiated \(SS 19.6, PauṣS 1.34-36\).218 According to the SS \(7.57-64\), members of all *varṇa* s who aspire to liberation only can perform the twelve year vow \( *dvādaśavārṣikavrata*\), though each *varṇa* must begin the vow at different times of the year. Regarding the rites of reparation \( *prāyaścitta*\), the SS \(16.20-22\) rules that the lower the *varṇa* of the initiate, the longer the rites must be performed in order to destroy whatever impurities \( *kalmaṣa*\) have accumulated. Elsewhere, it is mentioned that the different *varṇa* s have their own mantras \( *svamantra*, SS 18.9c-10b\). 

However, all initiates \(i.e. including Śūdras and women\) appear to be eligible to 216 JS 25.14-15: *viḍvarāhair atho gṛdhragomāyukapikukkuṭaiḥ */ *saṃspṛṣṭam antyajenāpi* *śūdrādyucchiṣṭadūṣitam *// *abhojyānnaṃ tu vā bhuktvā sevitvā ’nyastriyaṃ tu vā */ *snātvā bhuktvā tv* *ahorātraṃ pañcagavyaṃ samācaret *//. 

217 According to Manu \(10.12, 16\) a Caṇḍāla is the lowest Pratiloma i.e. the offspring of a Śūdra father and a Brahmin mother. He is, says Manu, “the worst of men” \( *adhamo nṛṇām*, ibid.\). 

218 In the SS \(19.6\), as in the JS, these women must be “pure minded” or “devout” \( *bhāvitātman*\). [[124]]

receive the sacred thread \( *upavīta*\) at the end of the *bhūtaśuddhi* rite \(SS 19.51c-52b\),219 and though Śūdras may not recite the mantric formulas *vauṣaṭ*, *svāhā * and *vaṣaṭ*, they can achieve the same effect \( *kārya*\) by reciting *namaḥ*.220 In an earlier chapter \(SS 2.7c-12b\), as we have seen above, Kṣatriyas, Vaiśyas and Śūdras are prohibited from worshipping the Vyūhas with mantras. Meanwhile, the PauṣS 

\(27.131c-132\) endorses the use of mantras with the *praṇava* \( *oṃ*\) by Śūdras, provided they are suitable \( *yogyatāvaśāt*\), and by women, provided they are virtuous \( *sadācāravaśāt*\). In another passage of the PauṣS, which is largely incomprehensible due to the corrupt and lacunose text, it is nonetheless possible to discern the claim that there is no fault \( *doṣa*\) accrued when Brahmins who are learned in the Veda eat food which has been offered in worship by Śūdras.221 In a later chapter, it is forbidden to give the food offered in worship \( *naivedya*\) to non-devotees \( *abhakta*\), 

“deniers” \( *nāstika*\), those of a wicked nature \( *durātman*\), women, Śūdras, animals and servants \(PauṣS 31.197-199\). 

The JS and the PauṣS in particular contain passages which appear to express conflicting attitudes towards the Brahminical *varṇa* system. This is not especially surprising given that these are not homogeneous, singly authored works, but it is worth restating the presence of these inconsistencies in order to remind ourselves of the difficulty in speaking about these texts in “general” terms. Indeed, this is especially true of the JS and the PauṣS, both of which contain portions which appear to have been authored in South India, in a sociocultural context quite different from that of their presumably North Indian origins. It may be tentatively proposed that the more “orthodox” attitudes towards social class, such as those expressed in the passage from the PauṣS just referred to \(i.e. PauṣS 31.197-199\), and in the prescriptions for the reparation rites in JS 25, belong to the later portions of these works since, as we will see presently, such attitudes are found increasingly often in 219 The *bhūtaśuddhi* rite consists of “the purification of the elements within the body \[of the initiate\]” 

\(Flood 2006: 106\). See also Flood \(2000\). 

220 SS 19.54c-55b: *vauṣaṭsvāhāvaṣaṭkāraniṣṭhānāṃ tu pratikriyā *// *namaskāreṇa mantrāṇāṃ kārye* *prāpte hy anugrahe */. 

221 PauṣS 27.695c-697b: *śrotriyāṇāṃ dvijendrāṇāṃ tvadarthāśramavartinām *// *yadvad bhuktād* *dhaviś *\(corr. Apte *dhavaś*\) *śūdrān na doṣo jñānagauravāt */ *evaṃ svabhāvadīptānāṃ nirmalānāṃ*

*sadaiva hi *// *na vai jātaṃ nānairmalyaṃ *\(corr. Apte *na nairmalyaṃ*\) *bhavec chūdraparigrahāt */. [[125]]

the later, South Indian Saṃhitās. It is worth noting in this context that Smith \(1975: 130\) has drawn attention to another verse in the JS’s chapter on the reparation rites \(JS 25.144\) which, in his opinion, points to a South Indian provenance. Of course, palaeographic evidence would be required to conclusively determine whether sections of this chapter have indeed been inserted into older material. 

In the South Indian works, then, there is a gradual but decisive shift in attitudes. 

The SanS, which may be one of the earliest extant South Indian scriptures since it is quoted by Yāmuna in his ĀP,222 gives a good indication of this in the ninth chapter of the section called *Indrarātra*. Here, the following is said: *ācāryagrahaṇe yogyās trayo varṇā dvijātayaḥ */ *ācāryatvaṃ na śūdrās tu* *labhate jātucit kvacit *// *caturṇām api varṇānām ācāryo brāhmaṇo bhavet */ 

*tadalābhe kṣatriyas tu ācāryo vaiśyaśūdrayoḥ *// *brāhmaṇakṣatriyālābhe* *vaiśyaḥ syāc chūdrajanmanaḥ */. – * *“The three twice-born social classes are eligible to take up \[the position\] of *ācārya*. Śūdras are not permitted \[to take up\] 

the position of *ācārya* under any circumstances. Of the four social classes, a Brahmin should \[ideally\] be the *ācārya*. In the absence of him \[i.e. a Brahmin\], a Kṣatriya \[can be\] the *ācārya* for Vaiśyas and Śūdras. In the absence of a Brahmin and a Kṣatriya, a Vaiśya can be \[the *ācārya*\] for one who is born of Śūdras.” \(SanS *Indrarātra* 9.13-15b\) 

This is very similar to the passage from the JS \(18.5c-9\) referred to above, except that here the SanS removes the right for Śūdras to act as preceptors for other Śūdras. Several verses later, the SanS restates this prohibition, but with an *addenda*: *brāhmaṇāc chūdrakanyāyāṃ jātaḥ śūdrottamas tu yaḥ */ *śūdrāṇām uttamaḥ so*

*’pi na cācāryatvam arhati *// *śūdrottamasya kānyāyāṃ brāhmaṇād yas tu jāyate*

/ *kalpavaiśyas tu prokto vaiśyakalpo na saṃśayaḥ *// *sarveṣām api śūdrāṇāṃ*

*sa cācaryo bhaviṣyati */. – “One who is born of a daughter of a Śūdra, and a Brahmin, is the best of Śūdras. Even though he is the best of Śūdras, he is not able to be an *ācārya*. But one who is born of the daughter of \[one who is\] the best of Śūdras, and a Brahmin, he is called a Kalpavaiśya, and he is undoubtedly almost equal to a Vaiśya. He *can* be an *ācārya* to all Śūdras.” \(SanS *Indrarātra* 9.24-26b\) 

Elsewhere, the SanS \( *Ṛṣirātra* 5.30c-40b\) prohibits Śūdras and women from entering into the *maṇḍala* \(see Rastelli 2002a: 132-133\), and warns that they should 222 See ĀP 161.6 quoting SanS *Indrarātra* 9.2ab, and ĀP 162.1-4 quoting SanS *Indrarātra * 1.10c-11, 10ab. [[126]]

only be initiated at certain times of the year \(SanS *Indrarātra* 4.9\). Nonetheless, like the JS, SS and PauṣS, it does allow that they may be initiated. The acceptance of Śūdras, but with these sorts of qualifications and prohibitions, is common in the South Indian Pāñcarātra literature. Thus, the ViśS \(3.17-18b\) initially states that the initiate \( *śiṣya*\) should be born of a good family \( *praśastakula*\) belonging to the highest three social classes \( *varṇa*\), and should have studied the Vedas together with their auxiliary parts \( *sāṅga*\) etc. However, in a subsequent verse \(ViśS 3.27\) it is said that the *guru*, out of compassion \( *kṛpayā*\), should also accept as initiates women, Śūdras and \(mixed class\) Anulomas who are “endowed with noble qualities” 

\( *kalyāṇaguṇasaṃyutāḥ*\). In a later chapter, the ViśS rules that none of these persons should hear mantras containing the *praṇava*, or *namaḥ*, *svāhā*, *huṃ*, and *phaṭ* etc., or Viṣṇu’s name with the dative ending.223 This contradicts the SS \(19.54c-55b\), of course, which rules that Śūdras may recite *namaḥ*, and the PauṣS \(27.131c-132\) which allows that women and Śūdras may recite *oṃ*. The PādS \( *cp* 2.61c-64\) contains a very similar proscription against women, Śūdras and Anulomas,224 as does the later ŚrīprśS \(16.138c-141\), which also prohibits Śūdras from receiving instruction in the method of the “five times” \( *gurūttamaḥ *// *pañcakālavidhiṃ cāpi* *vinā śūdram upādiśet*, ŚrīprśS 16.137d-138b\). In other instances, Śūdras are barred from performing fire-offerings \( *homa*\) \(e.g. ParS 27.31, ViṣṇuS 2.9c-10b\). 

Insofar as it is possible to detect unidirectional trends in the large, and often internally inconsistent corpus of South Indian Pāñcarātra literature, then, we might provisionally conclude that there is a greater tendency among the later works towards Brahminical “orthodoxy” with regard to the question of social class \( *varṇa*\). Where the SanS, an apparently relatively early South Indian text, allows Kṣatriyas, Vaiśyas and ‘Kalpavaiśyas’ to perform limited duties as *ācārya*, for instance, the later NārS 

\(11.21-35b\) allows the Kṣatriya to act as *guru*, but states that only Brahmins may inhabit the higher role of *ācārya*. Śūdras, in this scheme, are unequivocally restricted 223 ViśS 9.72-73: *śūdrāṇāṃ ca tathā strīṇām anulomabhuvām api */ *namaḥsvāhāhuṃphaḍādirahitaṃ*

*praṇavena ca *// *varjitaṃ viṣṇunāmaiva caturthyantaṃ ca pāṭhayet */ *gāyatrīṃ japahomaṃ ca* *ādadyād brāhmaṇo manum *//. 

224 See also PādS *kp* 9.19, where it is said that women, Śūdras and Anulomas should worship silently \( *tūṣṇīm ādhānam ācaret*\), which means without mantras \( *amantraka*\). [[127]]

to the lowest level of initiate \( *samayin*\).225 Works which are still later, such as the MārkS \(12.1\), the ŚrīprśS \(4.16-18\) and the ŚrīpurS \(2.4-8\), meanwhile, dictate that only a Brahmin can be *guru* or *ācārya*. We also find among many later Saṃhitās an increased antipathy towards Śūdras and women, even when these persons are admitted still for initiation. In several, for example, a rite of purification, or literally 

“pacification” \( *śāntihoma*\), is prescribed in the event that the temple icon \( *bimba*\) has been touched by either \(e.g. NārS 25.248c-249c, ViṣṇuS 28.22 *ff*, ĪS 19.134-145b\). Meanwhile the ŚrīprśS, in its chapter on the reparation rites, lists women and those who have not been initiated into the twice-born classes \( *anupanīta*\) alongside lepers \( *kuṣṭhin*\), people with tuberculosis \( *yakṣman*\), the mute \( *mūkaka*\), those who are blind in one eye \( *kāṇa*\), those with missing limbs \( *aṅgahīna*\), Pratilomas, and the bastard offspring of adulterous women \( *kuṇḍa*\) and widows \( *golaka*\) \(ŚrīprśS 

49.168-169\).226 However, it should be stated that not all of the later texts at my disposal contain such passages. For instance, the 26th chapter of the MārkS, which concentrates mostly on the required reparation rites for damaged temple icons, claims \(at MārkS 26.29c-30\) that these are defiled by contact with foreigners \( *mleccha*\), people with missing limbs \( *aṅgahīna*\) and dogs \( *śvāna*\), but it does not mention women or Śūdras \(though admittedly there is a small portion of text missing at MārkS 26.30c\). Likewise, the ŚrīpurS \(30.38 *ff*\) prescribes a reparation rite in the event that the temple icon is touched by a Cāṇḍāla, a Śabara, or various animals, but it does not mention women and Śūdras.227 

Moreover, despite the apparent trend towards an increasingly conservative attitude towards women and Śūdras, I have only been able to find one instance where Śūdras are disqualified from initation altogether. This occurs in the ViṣṇuS \(29.2\). 

Even the PādS, which explicitly characterises the Āgamasiddhānta \(PādS *cp* 21.37-225 The NārS \(11.21-35b\) names a hierarchy of seven initiates: *samayin*, *dīkṣita*, *cakravartin*, *abhiṣikta*, *guru*, *ācārya*, and *bhagavant*. These are respectively identified with seven sacrificial ceremonies: *yāga*, *stoma*, *mahāyāga*, *adhvara*, *sava*, *kratu*, and *haristoma*. The NārS rules that the Brahmin is qualified to perform all seven sacrifices, the Kṣatriya the first five, the Vaiśya the first three, and the Śūdra only the first \(i.e. *yāga*\). Cf. SanS *Indrarātra* 4.53-55 and ViṣṇuS 29.2-4, both of which name the same sevenfold hierarchy of initiate and the corresponding sacrifices, but which do not add the detail concerning *varṇa* affiliation. 

226 See Manu 3.174 for these definitions of *kuṇḍa* and *golaka*. 

227 According to Monier-Williams \(2002: 1052\), ‘Śabara’ is the name of “a wild mountaineer tribe in the Deccan” which was “in later language applied to any savage or barbarian”. [[128]]

40\), the Tantrasiddhānta \(PādS *cp* 21.55-56, 66ab\), and the Tantrāntarasiddhānta \(PādS *cp* 21.70c-73b\) as each accepting members of all four *varṇa* s, contains passages which show that the Mantrasiddhānta, its own tradition, did as well \(e.g. 

PādS *kp* 1.15c-17b, *cp* 2.61c-64\). To what, then, can we attribute this continued, albeit often reluctant, acceptance of Śūdras in particular? 

Marzenna Czerniak-Drożdżowicz \(2003: 62\) answers this question with reference to the ParS, but her answer can be applied to the broader context: “The possibility of acceptable Śūdras’ limited participation in the religious life seems to be one of the characteristic features of the ParS’s tradition. It could not accept the full participation of Śūdras, but faced by the political and economical influence of Śūdra devotees, it was obliged to accept them to some extent.” She elaborates on “the circumstances in which Pāñcarātra found itself in the south of India, where orthodox Brahmanism was exceptionally influential but where at the same time groups classified as Śūdras were not only numerically predominant but also in some cases, such as that of the Veḷḷāla agriculturalists, a power element in a society active in the patronage of religion” \(ibid.: 73\). This latter phenomenon has been discussed by Burton Stein \(1980: 241-253\), who identifies processes of urbanisation in twelfth and thirteenth century South India as catalysts of a general increase in social mobility. 

According to Stein \(2004: 86, 97\), inscriptional evidence from this period attests to the fact that many Śūdras came to enjoy considerable “social power”, and that some Śūdra families, especially from the thirteenth century, “seem to have gained Kshatriya identification through their successful assumption of roles as warrior leaders”. 

We might conclude, then, that there were political drawbacks to a thoroughgoing “Vedification” of Pāñcarātra traditions in South India. Although it is certainly not wise to take scriptural ordinances on their own as evidence of ethnographic realities, the extended passage in the SanS \( *Indrarātra * 9.13-50b\) which contains the verses on the ‘Kalpavaiśya’ which I have quoted above does appear to indicate an environment in which a high degree of social mobility was possible. The political advantages in continuing to accept Śūdras into the fold must have been substantial given that in other respects Pāñcarātrikas were increasingly keen to stress 129 

the continuity of their own practices with those legitimated by Brahminical orthodoxy. In the sort of social environment described by Czerniak-Drożdżowicz and Stein, it is easy to imagine that there would have been significant advantages also in accepting, to repeat Sanderson’s \(2005: 231-232\) words, “that the brahmanical tradition alone was valid in the domain it claimed for itself”. Indeed, the SanS can be interpreted as articulating a similar idea, albeit with a final qualification: *vaidikaṃ tāntrikaṃ caiva tathā vaidikatāntrikam * // *trividhaṃ karma* *saṃproktaṃ pratiṣṭhārādhanādiṣu* / *vaidikaṃ brāhmaṇānāṃ tu rājñāṃ*

*vaidikatāntrikam* // *tāntrikaṃ vaiśyaśūdrāṇāṃ sarveṣāṃ tāntrikaṃ tu vā */. – 

“Ritual action concerning installation and worship etc. is declared to be threefold: Vedic, Tantric, and Vedic *and* Tantric. Vedic is for Brahmins, Vedic *and* Tantric is for kings, \[and\] Tantric is for Vaiśyas and Śūdras. But \[in fact\] 

Tantric is for everyone.” \(SanS *Bramarātra* 6.29c-31b\)228 

The ViṣS, which contains the same verses \(at 39.315-316\), elsewhere states that 

“worship for oneself” should be either Vedic or Tantric, while “worship for others” 

should be either Tantric or “mixed” but *never* Vedic.229 By such means, the Pāñcarātrikas who practised “mixed worship” gave themselves, at least theoretically, a distinct advantage over their Smārta rivals, and they did so while managing to maintain a veneer of orthodoxy. For, as is clearly attested in Yāmuna’s ĀP \(e.g. 

14.10 *ff*\), the professional priestly performance of worship “for others” \( *parārtha*\) was deeply frowned upon in orthodox Brahminical society, and indeed in that sphere entailed the loss of one’s Brahminical status. As is evident from these regulations in the SanS and the ViṣS, Pāñcarātrikas were happy to accept that such restrictions were valid within the domain that imposed them, and of course these constraints, as well those which excluded Śūdras from the category of initiate, worked to their own advantage. For in an environment characterised by increasing social mobility and the rise to power of landowning communities considered by many not to belong to the twice-born classes, the authority and power of the domain that the orthodox 228 See alternative expressions of the same idea at SanS *Brahmarātra* 4.68c-73, and *Ṛṣirātra* 5.37-40, and 9.7-10, 22-24. 

229 ViṣS 20.344-345: *ātmārthaṃ vaidikenaiva tāntrikeṇaiva vā mune */ *parārthe tāntrikeṇaiva* *miśritaṃ vā hariṃ param *// *arcayet pūrvavad dhīmān rājño rāṣṭrasya vardhanam */ *parārthe* *vaidikenaiva na kuryāt tu kathaṃcana *//. [[130]]

Brahminical tradition claimed for itself would have been substantially diminished.230 

In such a context, professional Pāñcarātrika ritualists were no doubt keenly aware of the advantages in limiting the degree to which their own tradition underwent Vedification.
