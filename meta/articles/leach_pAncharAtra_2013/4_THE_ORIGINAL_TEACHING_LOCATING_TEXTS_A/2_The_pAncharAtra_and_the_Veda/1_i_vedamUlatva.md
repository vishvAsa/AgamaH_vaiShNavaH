How do the Pāñcarātra scriptures define themselves in relation to the Veda? Are there common approaches to this question among those works which do not appeal to the Ekāyanaveda? And do largely earlier texts such as the *Jayākhyasaṃhitā *\(JS\), *Sātvatasaṃhitā *\(SS\) and *Pauṣkarasaṃhitā* \(PauṣS\) utilise similar methods to the Saṃhitās composed in South India? As we will see in the following, one of the most frequently used strategies in the later, South Indian works is the claim that the original form of the teaching upon which the present work is based is none other than the Veda itself. Of course, acceptance of this claim would satisfy the well-known Mīmāṃsaka criterion for a source of valid knowledge \( *pramāṇa*\) relating to *dharma*. 

In his *Tantravārttika *\(TV\), on 1.3.4 \(328.14 *ff*\), the sixth century187 Mīmāṃsaka philosopher Kumārila had employed the *vedamūlatva* principle to argue *against* the validity of the Pāñcarātras, whose treatises \( *nibandhana*\) he grouped together with those of the Sāṃkhyas, Yogas, Pāśupatas, Buddhists \( *śākya*\) and Jains \( *nirgrantha*\). 

Each of these Kumārila declared “contrary to the triple Veda” \( *trayīviparīta*\), and 

“not accepted by those who know the triple Veda” \( *etāni trayīvidbhir na* *parigṛhītāni*\). Over a century later, the Pāñcarātra tradition’s non-conformity with the Veda was also affirmed by Śaṅkara. In his *Brahmasūtrabhāṣya* \(BSBh\) * * on 2.2.45 

\(418.1-5\), Śaṅkara claims that there are a number of doctrinal issues on which the Pañcarātra teaching is in conflict with the Veda \( *vedavipratiṣedha*\). 

According to currently accepted chronologies, both Kumārila and Śaṅkara lived long before the composition of our earliest Pāñcarātra scriptural sources. It is, for this reason alone, difficult to estimate the effect that these thinkers’ criticisms might have 187 Vincent Eltschinger \(2010\) refers to Helmut Krasser’s forthcoming article “How to Teach a Buddhist Monk to Refute the Heretics? Bhāviveka’s relationship to Kumārila and Dharmakīrti”. In this article, Krasser places Kumārila in the sixth century. I am very grateful to Dr. Eltschinger for providing me with a copy of his own article.

had on Pāñcarātra traditions themselves. Having said this, it seems somehow unlikely that Śaṅkara’s rejection of the Pāñcarātra’s compatibility with the Veda would have significantly influenced developments *within* the Pāñcarātra, not least because it is based on a philosophical position and an interpretation of the Veda which our earliest Pāñcarātra authors do not appear to have shared.188 If the Pāñcarātrika response to Mīmāṃsaka criticism in later South India is anything to go by, however, it seems probable that Kumārila’s attack on the credibility of the Pāñcarātra would have elicited a more significant reaction. For Kumārila’s rejection of the Pāñcarātra’s validity is based not on a few metaphysical distinctions but, as with Yāmuna’s Mīmāṃsaka opponent in the *Āgamaprāmāṇya *\(ĀP\), on their entire methodology, and on their sociocultural status, which Kumārila claims lies “outside the Veda” 

\( *vedabāhyaḥ*, TV 330.17\). 

As it stands, there is no evidence either way for a direct Pāñcarātrika response to Kumārila or to Śaṅkara. At any rate, as we will see shortly, these thinkers’ 

criticisms of the Pāñcarātra appear to have had little influence on the authors of the earliest Saṃhitās, who quite openly announce their own teachings’ superiority to the Veda.189 But we might tentatively suppose that certain formal features of the Pāñcarātra scriptural tradition – the terminology borrowed from Vedic ritual \( *yāga*, *ijyā*, etc.\), the fact that the works are written in Sanskrit, normally in the *anuṣṭubh* metre, that they are called *saṃhitā* – may have been motivated by a desire to counter the sort of attitude displayed by Kumārila. Of course, judging by the evidence provided in Yāmuna’s ĀP, and also in Bhaṭṭa Jayanta’s play *Āgamaḍambara *\(ĀḌ\), these strategies were not wholly successful. In the latter \(ĀḌ 4.3\), for instance, a 

“Vedic officiant” \( *ṛtvik*\) names the Pāñcarātrikas alongside the Śaivas, Pāśupatas, Sāṃkhyas, Buddhists \( *saugata*\) and Digambara Jains as members of “heterodox 188 The JS, SS and PauṣS are in no sense “philosophical” texts, and nor do they articulate a consistent metaphysics. However, each of them generally inclines more towards the position of “difference and non-difference” \( *bhedābheda*\), than towards Śaṅkara’s type of “non-dualism” \( *advaita*\). On Bhedābhedavāda in the JS see Rastelli \(1999\); in the SS, see below. 

189 This apparent lack of influence is hardly surprising given the distance in time between these thinkers and the composition of the Saṃhitās. Inevitably, geography may also have been a factor. 

Śaṅkara was almost certainly from South India \(Lorenzen 1983: 156\). Kumārila was probably also from the south, though this is less certain \(Taber 2007: 390\). As I have stated above, the JS, SS and PauṣS were all probably *initially* composed in North India.

religions” \( *bāhyāgamā*, Dezső 2005: 193\), voicing his annoyance “that these Pāñcarātrika Bhāgavatas should adopt brahminical manners” \(ĀḌ 4.11, trans. Dezső 

2005: 195\).190 Several centuries after Kumārila, then, the Pāñcarātra continued to attract criticism from orthodox outsiders who saw themselves as the genuine representatives and custodians of Vedic tradition. But the very fact that Pāñcarātrikas could acquire the support of a non-Vaiṣṇava Brahmin such as Jayanta indicates, at least, that by the time of the composition of our earliest Saṃhitās, they had become, in Sanderson’s \(1985: 208 n. 3\) words, “well-connected”. Indeed, this is conveyed quite clearly in the ĀḌ itself, when the Vedic officiant grudgingly remarks that Queen Sugandhā is reported to be sympathetic \( *sānukrośā*\) towards the Bhāgavatas \(i.e. the Pāñcarātrikas\), and that a royal minister \( *rājapuruṣa*\) shows favour to them \(ĀḌ 4.19\).191 

Unfortunately, at present we know very little about the precise context in which the earliest Pāñcarātra Saṃhitās were written. Sanderson \(2009: 58 *ff*\) has recently drawn attention to evidence suggesting that the Pāñcarātra received royal patronage during the Kārkoṭa dynasty \(c. 626-855 CE\) of Kashmir, and that it went into decline in that region shortly thereafter, as royal preference shifted to the Śaivism of the Mantramārga. According to Sanderson \(ibid.: 61\), it is highly probable that the Pāñcarātra produced its earliest extant works while “in the shadow of Śaivism”, and that these texts are “the product of a thorough reformation in which Vaiṣṇavas followed the example of the already flourishing Śaiva Mantramārga in order to provide themselves with a substantially new ritual system that would enable them to compete more effectively with their rivals.” Elsewhere, Sanderson \(2005: 232 n. 3\) notes that the most prominent among these rivals, namely the Śaiva Saiddhāntikas, 

“came to be widely accepted as co-religionists in traditional brahmanical circles”, and that this is attested to, for example, in Bhaṭṭa Jayanta’s *Nyāyamañjarī*. How did 190 Dezső’s translation of the Vedic officiant’s complaints at ĀḌ 4.11 continues thus: “They 

\[Pāñcarātrikas\] mix with brahmins and have no scruples about using the form of greeting that only we may use to our equals. They recite the Pañcarātra scriptures with a special pattern of accented syllables, as if they were taking the text of Veda as their example. “We are brahmins,” they say of themselves, and demand that others speak of them in the same way.” 

191 Sugandhā, queen consort of the ruling Śaṅkaravarman, would later briefly become regent \(904-906 

CE\), though I am not aware of any evidence that Pāñcarātrikas benefitted from this. 

113 

the Saiddhāntikas acquire this status? This is an important question for our own purposes since, as Jayanta and Yāmuna show, it is precisely this recognition that Pāñcarātrikas craved. If the Pāñcarātra remodelled itself in accordance with Śaiva norms, then, we can assume that their strategies coincided to some degree with those of the Saiddhāntikas. Here it is worth quoting Sanderson’s \(2005: 231-232\) summary of the latter: 

\[T\]he Śaivism of the Mantramārga developed in practice a thorough accommodation of the brahmanical religion that it claimed to transcend, thus minimizing, even eliminating, the offense it gave as a tradition whose scriptures, like those of the Buddhists, were seen to be, and claimed to be, outside the corpus of the Vedas. These Śaivas were to accept that the brahmanical tradition alone was valid in the domain it claimed for itself and that they were bound to follow its prescriptions and incorporate its rituals beside their own wherever practicable. 

With regard to the early Pāñcarātra Saṃhitās, this method of accommodation is perhaps most strikingly evident in the inclusion in the daily liturgy of a fire-sacrifice based on the Vedic model \(e.g. JS 15, SS 6.76-168b, PauṣS 28.1-29.61\). Indeed, as Rastelli \(2000a\) has pointed out, there are numerous correspondences between the daily religious duties of Pāñcarātrikas, and those of the “orthoprax” Smārta householders. However, such methods of accommodation and appropriation do not, in the earlier works, represent an attempt to situate their own religious practices within the domain of Vedic ritualism. For there is, in addition, a large repertoire of supernumerary duties, the performance of which can lead to higher accomplishments than are available to those who practise only the Smārta rites. This idea is introduced at the very beginning of the JS, during the narration of the transmission of the teaching \( *śāstrāvataraṇa*\). Here, when the sage Saṃvartaka asks his father Aurva how rebirth in *saṃsāra * can be avoided, Aurva tells him that long ago, in the Kṛta Age, he had sought the same goal by practising austerities alongside sages learned in the Veda and its auxiliary disciplines \( *vedāṅga*, JS 1.7\). After many thousands of years of unproductive asceticism, a great voice had told them that performing sacrifices, studying the Veda, giving gifts, and undertaking various rites and vows such as the Cāndrāyana fast etc., would not lead to liberation from bondage, even 114 

after ten million *yuga* s, without knowledge of the supreme god \(JS 1.8-16\).192 This knowledge is made available in the following teaching. 

The Veda’s inability to lead its practitioners towards liberation is also expressed in the *śāstrāvataraṇa * portions of later works, including the *Paramasaṃhitā *\(ParS 1.3-4\) and the *Pādmasaṃhitā *\(PādS *jp* 1.2-9\). The primary purpose of this claim, no doubt, is that it serves as a justification for an additional system of rites, while at the same time conveying the superiority of the Pāñcarātra teaching. But the way in which the claim is articulated, which is fairly consistent across texts, also serves another important purpose. It conveys the notion that those who undertake initiation into the Pāñcarātra have already been initiated into the Veda, but have been unable to achieve their goal/s within that system. In this way, the Pāñcarātra is presented as an additional, higher teaching for Vedic initiates who desire additional and higher goals. The passage from the JS which I summarised above might not belong to the oldest parts of that text, but the general idea it expresses \(if not its single-minded prioritisation of liberation over other accomplishments\) can also be found, for example, in the SS. In the 21st chapter of this work, which is devoted to the general rules for initiates, it is announced that “the content \(or ‘meaning’\) of the teaching is revealed to devotees who have undergone initiation \( *dīkṣā*\). And for the others, there is the Dharmaśāstra” \(or, as Alaśiṅgabhaṭṭa, the SS’s later commentator puts it “only the Dharmaśāstra”, *kevaladharmaśāstram*, STBh p. 509\).193 The later *Ahirbudhnyasaṃhitā* \(AS\) even draws on orthodox Brahminical tradition to express a similar point. Here, it is said that the Vedic initiation \( *upanayana*\) represents a “second birth”, whereas initiation into the Pāñcarātra \( *yajñadīkṣā*\) is the “third birth”.194 

The earliest of the published Saṃhitās situate themselves above the Veda. What is more, we can be certain that earlier Pāñcarātrikas, whose texts have not survived, 192 Compare JS 1.11 with *Bhagavadgītā* 11.48ab.

also held this position, for it is explicitly criticised by Śaṅkara in his BSBh.195 It is also, as we will see in Chapter Seven, continuous with methods of classification found in the younger parts of the *Nārāyaṇīya*. Although the earliest Saṃhitās present themselves notionally as higher teachings for those who are already eligible for Vedic instruction, in reality, as we will see below, they appeal to a considerably broader social audience, and they do not claim to be “rooted in the Veda”. As far as I am aware, the earliest articulation of the idea that the Pāñcarātra is rooted in the Veda is contained in Bhaṭṭa Jayanta’s late ninth or early tenth century philosophical drama the ĀḌ. Here, the eminent Naiyāyika scholar known as Dhairyarāśi argues that “statements of the Pañcarātra and other such \[traditions\] are valid \( *prāmāṇyahetuḥ*\) because they are rooted in the Veda \( *vedamūlatā*\)” \(ĀḌ 4.147\). In South India, this became a common theme. Yāmuna’s ĀP \(e.g. 7.12-14\) demonstrates clearly in its *pūrvapakṣa* section that the *vedamūlatva* principle was, by this time, already well established within the Pāñcarātra. Yāmuna’s own response to his Mīmāṃsaka opponent’s denial that the Pāñcarātra is rooted in the Veda is as follows: 

*sa*

*khalu*

*bhagavān*

*amoghasahajasaṃvedanasākṣādbhavadakhilavedarāśir*

*viprakīrṇavividhavidhyarthavādamantrātmakānekaśākhādhyayanadhāraṇādiṣv* *adhīradhiyo bhaktān avalokya tadanukampayā laghunopāyena tadarthaṃ*

*saṃkṣipyopadideśeti*. – “The Lord, for whom the entire collection of the Vedas is immediately present on account of his innate and unerring perception, upon seeing that his devotees were not sufficiently concentrated in their minds for studying and remembering the multiple recensions with their diverse and scattered injunctions, explanations and mantras, out of compassion \[for his devotees\] abridged its content in a succinct manner, and taught it thus.” \(ĀP 102.6-9\) Here, then, we see a clear articulation of what the Pāñcarātra’s being “rooted in the Veda” entails for Yāmuna. The singular Pāñcarātra teaching is a concise summary or “abridgement” of the vast and disordered collection of Vedic recensions \( *śākhā*\). This abridgement has been authored by God, and elsewhere \(e.g. ĀP 39.1-7, 60.5 *ff*, 84.1-3\) Yāmuna has already shown that Viṣṇu’s reliability is vouched for in 195 BSBh on 2.2.45 \(418.4-5\): *vedavipratiṣedhaś ca bhavati – caturṣu vedeṣu paraṃ śreyo ’labdhvā*

*śāṇḍilya idaṃ śāstram adhigatavān ityādivedanindādarśanāt */. – “And there is conflict with the Veda, for it is seen that the Veda is censured is statements such as “Not finding the supreme good in the four Vedas, Śāṇḍilya learnt this teaching \(i.e. Pañcarātra\).” 

116 

the unauthored \( *apauruṣeya*\) Vedas themselves. This application of the *vedamūlatva* principle represents a significant development from formulations found in the Pūrvamīmāṃsā. In that tradition, the authority of “remembered” \( *smṛti*\) texts and practices which are “rooted in the Veda” is conferred by “texts inferentially proven to exist” i.e. “Vedic texts for one reason or another not accessible to us” \(Pollock 1997: 404, 407\). By contrast, Yāmuna’s Pāñcarātra is “rooted in the Veda” in the sense that it is a reformulation \(by God, no less\) not merely of various scattered injunctions \(see ibid.: 409\), or of a lost or otherwise inaccessible Vedic text or recension, but of “the entire Vedic corpus” \( *akhilavedarāśiḥ*\). 

Turning to the Pāñcarātra scriptures themselves, we find the same idea in the opening chapter of the *Viśvāmitrasaṃhitā* \(ViśS\), a presumably late, South Indian work which is not referred to by Vedāntadeśika, and so may well postdate him. Here, at ViśS 1.73-79, we are told that the Vedas were a source of confusion and that to remedy this, Nārāyaṇa condensed their content, the resulting abridgement being the 

“knowledge called Pañcarātra” \( *pañcarātrāhvayaṃ jñānam*\), said to be the “absolute essence of the content \(or ‘meaning’\) of the Vedas” \( *vedārthasārasarvasvam*\). Of course, this idea that the Pāñcaratra teaching constitutes a condensed version or abridgement \( *saṃkṣepa*\) of the Vedas carries with it the implication that, being shorter and easier to understand, it is actually an *improvement* on these texts. As we have seen, it was precisely this implied claim that was offered as evidence for the Pāñcarātra tradition’s “non-Vedic” status by Śaṅkara in his BSBh \(418.1-5, on 2.2.45\). It is also directly referred to by Yāmuna’s imagined Mīmāṃsaka opponent in the ĀP \(102.14 *ff*\).196 In fact, in the fourteenth century, Vedāntadeśika \(e.g. PRR 

25.8 *ff*\) was still having to defend the Pāñcarātra against the accusation that they censured the Veda, and considered their own system to be superior. 

Of the works available to me, it is only among the later, post-Yāmuna Saṃhitās that we encounter evidence of the *vedamūlatva* principle being explicitly incorporated into modes of scriptural self-understanding.197 With the exception of the 196 Yāmuna himself makes sure that he is not misunderstood on this point – for him the Pañcarātra and the Veda are equally authoritative \( *pañcarātraśrutyoḥ ekārthyam eva pratīyate*, ĀP 105.3\). 

197 However, a verse conveying the *vedamūlatva* principle which is quoted without attribution by Yāmuna at ĀP 102.11-12 is also quoted by Rāmānuja in his ŚrīBh \(332.15-19\) alongside verses from 117 

ViśS, these Saṃhitās tend to utilise a considerably more moderate version of the *vedamūlatva * idea – one that, at least ostensibly, reverses the notion that the Veda is inferior to the Pāñcarātra. Perhaps one of the earliest clear expressions of such an idea within the scriptural corpus is the declaration, found in both the PādS \( *jp* 1.91cd\) and the *Viṣvaksenasaṃhitā* \(ViṣS 8.5ab\), that it is “rooted in *śruti*, and is an authority like the Kalpasūtras” \( *śrutimūlam idaṃ tantraṃ pramāṇaṃ kalpasūtravat*\). 

As we have seen, the same verse is found in the later *Śrīpuruṣottamasaṃhitā* 

\(ŚrīpurS\),198 and it also occurs in the presumably later *Mārkaṇḍeyasaṃhitā* 

\(MārkS\).199 The claim in each of these works that they are equivalent in status to the Kalpasūtras is a rather humble retreat from earlier declarations \(at e.g. PauṣS 

38.307c-309\) that the Pāñcarātra is superior to the Veda. These younger Saṃhitās most likely compare themselves to the late ancillary \( *aṅga*\) Vedic Sūtras on the solemn \( *śrauta*\) and domestic \( *gṛhya*\) rites, and the rules for proper behaviour \( *dharma*\), which were universally categorised as Smṛti texts by this period \(Witzel 2003: 87\), in order to convey the idea that they are merely “ritual handbooks” which represent no great challenge to Vedic orthopraxy – indeed, they are continuous with that orthopraxy. 

A similar claim is found in the *Viṣṇusaṃhitā *\(ViṣṇuS\). N. P. Unni \(1991: 7-10\), in his long introduction to the printed edition of this text, suggests that the ViṣṇuS was authored by a Keralan Brahmin before, or during, the fourteenth century. 

He arrives at this *terminus ad quem* on the basis that the *Tantrasamuccaya*, which he says can be dated to the fourteenth century \(though several scholars, see e.g. Ślączka 2010, in fact date it to the fifteenth\), is indebted to the ViṣṇuS. The ViṣṇuS, which is strikingly “non-sectarian” in its outlook, calls itself a ‘Tantra’ \(ViṣṇuS 2.1\), which it the ParS \(1.3-4\). The ParS is quoted by Yāmuna, and so predates him. However, the verse in question is not found in the present version of the ParS. The verse reads: *vedānteṣu yathāsāraṃ saṃgṛhya* *bhagavān hariḥ */ *bhaktānukampayā vidvān saṃcikṣepa yathāsukham* //. – “The omniscient Lord Hari, after taking the essence of the Upaniṣads, out of compassion for his devotees condensed it for their benefit.” 

198 SrīpurS 1.26cd. Here the verse appears to have been drawn directly from the PādS. Note, also, ŚrīpurS 1.27cd ↔ MārkS 1.42cd. 

199 MārkS 1.38ab. In this instance too, the verse appears to have been borrowed directly from the PādS, since the ensuing verses are also contained in the earlier work \(MārkS 1.39-42b ← PādS *jp* 1.93c-96\). My assumption that the MārkS is later than the PādS is based upon the reasons articulated in Smith \(1975: 328\) and Gonda \(1977: 106\). The ViṣS, meanwhile, may be more or less contemporary with the PādS \(Matsubara 1994: 35\). 

118 

defines etymologically as “that by which all things are accomplished and people are protected from danger” \( *sarve ’thā yena tanyante trāyante ca bhayāj janāḥ*, ViṣṇuS 

2.10cd\). According to ViṣṇuS 2.20, there are five subdivisions of ‘Tantra’, each distinguished from the other on the basis of their having different speakers \( *vaktṛ*\). 

The five distinct Tantras are named as Śaiva, Vaiṣṇava, Brāhma, Saura, and Kaumāra. The ViṣṇuS argues that “because it is rooted in the Veda, or rather in \[the authority of\] reliable persons \( *āpta*\), Tantra is an authoritative source of knowledge like the Purāṇas or like the statements of Manu and others.”200 A few verses later, this position is explained when the ViṣṇuS adopts the Naiyāyika view \(which is contrary to that held by Yāmuna\) that the Veda, like the Tantra, is itself an authoritative source of knowledge because it derives from a reliable person \( *āptamūlatā*, i.e. 

God\).201 Because Viṣṇu is a teacher of *dharma* \( *dharmapravaktṛ*\), we are told, what is said by him is akin to the statements of Manu \( *manuvākyavat*, ViṣṇuS 2.21ab\). 

The ViṣṇuS is one of many late South Indian Pāñcarātra works which explicitly enjoin the concurrent use of “Vedic” \( *vaidika*\) and “Tantric” \( *tāntrika*\) mantras.202 

Other scriptures which presumably belong to a similar period \(i.e. 13th-14th centuries, or possibly even later\), and which also enjoin what the *Nāradīyasaṃhitā* \(NārS\) calls 

“mixed worship” \( *miśrārcana*, 2.63ab\), include the ViśS,203 the *Śrīpraśnasaṃhitā*

\(ŚrīprśS\),204 and the ŚrīpurS.205 Among the apparently earlier \(pre-Vedāntadeśika\) South Indian works which openly prescribe a “mixed” \( *miśra*, *vyāmiśra*\) form of worship, we can count the PādS, the *Bhārgavatantra* \(BhT\),206 the NārS, the *Viṣvaksenasaṃhitā *\(ViṣS\),207 the *Lakṣmītantra* \(LT\),208 and the *Sanatkumārasaṃhitā*

200 ViṣṇuS 2.11c-12b: *vedamūlatayā tantraṃ āptamūlatayāthavā *// *purāṇavat pramāṇaṃ syāt tathā*

*manvādivākyavat */. 

201 ViṣṇuS 2.19: *āptaproktatayā tantraṃ pramāṇam iti ye viduḥ */ *vedaprāmāṇyam apy āhur* *āptamūlatayaiva te *//. The idea that the Vedas are authored by Viṣṇu is, unsurprisingly, common in the later Pāñcarātra works. Elsewhere see e.g. ViśS 4.34. 

202 See for example ViṣṇuS 4.18c-19, and 29.38-51b, 83. 

203 See the list of Vedic mantras in the printed edition of the ViśS p. 298. At ViśS 6.2 *ff*, knowledge of the *ṛṣi* and *chandas* elements \(6.10ab\) of the *praṇava* mantra is declared to be a prerequisite for this mantra’s successful employment. 

204 See e.g. ŚrīprśS 16.34. For a list of the Vedic mantras used in the ŚrīprśS, see Padmanabhan’s \(1969\) appendix to the printed edition of the text. 

205 See e.g. ŚrīpurS 19.12c-13, 22.46 *ff* and 24.41 *ff*. 

206 See e.g. BhT 24.17-18, 27c *ff*. 

207 See ViṣS 8.3c-6, 12.1 *ff*, 13.1-12, 13.34 *ff*, 20.343 *ff*, 31.7-9, 39.316 etc. 

208 See LT 11.49, and especially chapters 28-29 and 49-50. See also Gupta \(2000: 391\). 

119 

\(SanS\).209 In the scriptural literature that is available to me, the claim that the Pāñcarātra teaching is “rooted in the Veda” is one that is made exclusively by Pāñcarātrikas who practise what they call “mixed worship”. As we have seen in previous chapters, the PādS claims that this kind of worship is restricted to Pāñcarātrikas who belong to the tradition called ‘Mantrasiddhānta’. Among later works, the BhT \(22.88, 24.17-50\), the ŚrīprśS \(16.31c-34\), and the MārkS210 all associate themselves with this tradition. In the following, I attempt a brief and, inevitably, preliminary overview of the ways in which Pāñcarātra texts authorising mixed worship attempted to present themselves as being in conformity with Vedic tradition, while nonetheless avoiding some of the restrictions which a genuine conformity would have entailed.
