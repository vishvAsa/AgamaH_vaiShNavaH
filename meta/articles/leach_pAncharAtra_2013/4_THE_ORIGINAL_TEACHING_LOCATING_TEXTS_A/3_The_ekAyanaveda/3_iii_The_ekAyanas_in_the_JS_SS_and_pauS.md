title = "3 iii \\) The Ekāyanas in the JS, SS and PauṣS"

+++

Whether a text called ‘Ekāyanaveda’ ever existed has been debated by modern scholars, with Renou \(1947: 205\), for instance, claiming that the tradition of the Ekāyanaveda is a late invention, and Rastelli \(e.g. 2008: 265\) arguing that, nonetheless, a text or texts known as ‘Ekāyanaveda’ must have once been extant. In support of this, Rastelli points to the PārS’s \(17.451c\) prescription to recite the *ekāyanī śākhā*, and the JS’s \(20.269cd-270a\) prescription to recite mantras from the *ekāyanīyaśākhā*. To these we can perhaps add the PādS’s \( *cp* 13.66c-70b\) decree that the “original recension based on the Ekāyana” should be studied alongside the various recensions of the Ṛc, Yajus and Sāman. However, although there are a number of Pāñcarātra works which refer to the Ekāyana as a Vedic *śākhā*, it should be noted that none of these aforementioned verses refer precisely to an 

‘Ekāyanaveda’, and that if a text or texts bearing this name did once exist, it does not seem possible at present to identify it \(or them\) in any extant source. Certainly there is insufficient evidence to corroborate Krishnamacharya’s \(1959: 5\) suggestion that both the ‘Pañcarātraśruti’ and the ‘Pañcarātropaniṣad’ that are quoted by the Kashmirian author Bhagavadutpala in his *Spandapradīpikā* refer to the 

‘Ekāyanaveda’. The claim made by Alaśiṅgabhaṭṭa in his commentary on the ĪS, the *Sātvatārthaprakāśikā* \(SāPr\), namely that the JS, SS and PauṣS constitute the 

“sūtras” of the “original Veda” \( *mūlaveda*\) \(i.e. the Ekāyanaveda\),239 is probably best interpreted as a late attempt to solve the puzzle we are presently addressing, but it indicates, at least, that this author did not think it likely that the Ekāyanaveda was ever a unique work. Much the same idea is contained, as we have seen in Chapter One, in the ŚrīprśS \(49.471c-473\). ****

What, then, is the origin of the idea of the Ekāyanaveda, and of the Ekāyana tradition as a Vedic *śākhā*? Inevitably, these questions are not easy to answer, but we might gain a better understanding by turning to the earliest of the published Saṃhitās, namely the JS, SS and PauṣS. Although none of these works refer to an Ekāyanaveda, each of them contain references to Ekāyana mantras or to “twice-239 SāPr on ĪS 1.64-67: *idaṃ sātvatapauṣkarajayākhyatantratrayaṃ mūlavedasya sūtrarūpam*. 

141 

born” \( *dvija*\) Ekāyanas or Ekāyana Brahmins \( *vipra*\), and the JS refers to an Ekāyana *śākhā*. By analysing these passages, then, we may hope to learn something of the Ekāyana tradition in the centuries preceding the composition of works such as the PādS and the PārS. 

Of the earlier works, the JS will involve the shortest discussion, since a form of the term *ekāyana* occurs only twice in this text, and both instances belong to the same short passage \(JS 20.265-270\). The passage itself occurs within the context of the installation \( *pratiṣṭhā*\) of an image of Viṣṇu in a temple. Members of ten Vaiṣṇava denominations \(named above in Chapter Two\) are seated by the preceptor *\(ācārya*\) in the ordinal and cardinal directions and are instructed to recite “the supremely sacred mantras derived from the *ekāyanīyaśākhā*.” It is notable that none of the denominations is named *ekāyana*, though one of them is called *ekāntin*, a name which the PārS and the ĪS, as well as the PauṣS as we will see below, occasionally use synonymously with *ekāyana*. All ten denominations are called 

‘Pāñcarātrika’, and the JS tells us that their members may belong to any of the four *varṇa* s.240 As I have noted above, it is significant that the Vaikhānasas are included here among the Vaiṣṇava groups, for it indicates that this passage does not belong to the earliest portions of the JS, which appear to have been composed in either North India \(Sanderson 2009: 61\) or the upper Deccan \(Rajan 1981: 34\). As far as we know, the Vaikhānasas were restricted to South India throughout the premodern period, which suggests that the composition of this passage also occurred in the south. 

I shall now turn to the SS. The majority of SS 24.282-25.294, wherein all this work’s references to the Ekāyanas are found, have been incorporated into the PārS 

240 JS 20.265-270 \(→ PārS 12.311c-317b\): *bhagavadbhāvino ye ca yatayaḥ pāñcarātrikāḥ */ 

*caturbhir āptair viprādyair yuktāṃs tv īśadiśi nyaset *// *ekāntinas tathā ’nāptaiḥ *\(corr. *’ptaiś ca*\) *yuktān āgneyadiggatān */ *niveśya vipra naiṛtyāṃ bhaktān vaikhānasān *\(corr. *vaikhānasaiḥ*\) *saha *//

*saṃśitavratān* //. Both of the above emmendations are suggested by the editor. **

142 

and the ĪS.241 Here, at least four Ekāyanas \(24.302ab\) are named among the professional assistants to an officiating temple priest or *guru* - they are literally 

“guardians of the image” \( *mūrtipa*, 25.113d-114a, 255\) - in a sequence of rites relating to the construction of a temple \(24.282-433\) and the installation \( *pratiṣṭhā*\) and worship of a divine image therein \(25.39-260b\). These Ekāyanas are said to be Brahmins \( *vipra*, e.g. 24.287c, 25.118d\). They receive instructions from the guru together with other professional assistants \(25.106ab\) who are also identified as Brahmins, and who are said to be specialists in one or other of the four Vedas \(e.g. 

24.291a, 25.157ab, 170b, 206ab etc.\). These latter Brahmins are evidently also Pāñcarātrikas, and they are explicitly identified as such for they are called *bhagavanmaya* \(at 24.288b and 326b\), which is a common way of referring to a Pāñcarātrika adept both in the SS and in the broader scriptural literature.242 Although it is not precisely stated, they are presumably the same Brahmins that are described in the second chapter of the SS \(2.8cd\) as “adherents” or “proclaimers” of the Veda \( *vedavādin*\) who engage in “mixed sacrifices” \( *vyāmiśrayāga*\). 

In these chapters, the Ekāyanas are distinguished from the other Brahminical assistants \( *mūrtipa*\) primarily on account of their textual expertise. For while the latter are specialists in the Vedic mantras, the Ekāyanas are “knowers of the Pañcarātra” \( *pañcarātravid*, 25.134c\). Indeed, on two occasions they are referred to as simply ‘Pāñcarātrika’ in order to differentiate them from the Brahmins who recite from the Ṛgveda etc. \(24.344-345, 25.145c-146\). And at the beginning of the passage containing prescriptions for rites relating to the construction of the temple, the Ekāyanas are introduced as “Brahmins dedicated to the Sadāgama” \(24.287cd\). This latter term is given in the PauṣS \(at e.g. 38.307c-309\) as an alternative name for the 

‘Pañcarātra’. I will discuss this passage in the PauṣS below, when I address this text directly. 

241 Parallel passages between SS 24-25 and the PārS are listed in Rastelli \(2006: 577-578\). Regarding the ĪS, most of SS 24.282-433 is found at ĪS 16.93-104, and 139c-287. Most of SS 25.1-294 is contained in the 18th chapter of the ĪS, with the following exceptions: SS 25.64c-87b → ĪS 15.59c-61, 117-135; SS 25.260c-268c → ĪS 16.293c-301c; SS 25.271c-287b → ĪS 16.312c-328b. 

242 In the SS see e.g. 6.74cd \(and Alaśiṅgabhaṭṭa’s commentary on this verse\), 7.107c-109b, and 22.46. 

Elsewhere see e.g. JS 16.7-9, 18.6, and PauṣS 27.207cd, 32.88-89, 37.63cd etc. 

143 

Other names by which the Ekāyanas are known in this section of the SS include 

‘Tajjña’ \(25.124c\) and ‘Tanmaya’ \(25.132a\). The latter is ordinarily found either as an adjective meaning “made of that” or “consisting of that”, or as the derivative abstract noun *tanmayatva*. It occurs in its adjectival form in several Upaniṣads, where it has generally been interpreted as denoting a doctrine of identity with *brahman* \(“that”\).243 Both forms are commonly found in the Śaiva scriptural literature as well as that of the Pāñcarātra.244 Its use as a proper noun, such as we find in SS 25, is much less common, at least in Pāñcarātra works, though it is notable that this form can be found also in an earlier chapter of the SS.245 At any rate, we can take both ‘Tajjña’ and ‘Tanmaya’ as honorifics, and in this respect there is little to differentiate such forms from the qualifier *bhagavanmaya* which is applied to the priestly assistants who specialise in the Vedic mantras. 

What can we learn about the Ekāyanas from their role in the installation rites as related in the SS? A couple of points are worthy of note. Firstly, they appear to have a close association with the fourfold form of god \( *caturvyūha*\), for they represent these forms in the fire sacrifice \( *havana*\) during the installation of the pots \( *kumbha*\). 

Here it is said that the guru seats in the cardinal directions four Ekāyanas who bear the names “Vāsudeva and so on” \(24.302ab\). Later, they recite the *vyūhamantra* \(25.114\) and the mantras of the four forms \( *caturmūrti*, 25.242\). Secondly, throughout the installation rites the Ekāyanas recite not only Pāñcarātra mantras but also Vedic mantras \(e.g. at 24.333, 25.53-54b, 95c-96b, 113d-115b, 253-257b etc.\).246 Of course, this prescription for Ekāyanas to recite Vedic mantras contradicts the aforementioned assertion contained in the PādS \( *cp* 21.37c-39b\) – namely, that the Ekāyanas do not recite Vedic mantras. 

There is good reason to believe that chapters 24 and 25 are later additions to the SS, and that at least the final third of chapter 24 \(24.282-433\) and the bulk of chapter 25 were written together for inclusion within the text. There are several clues which point to the validity of these claims, and I will briefly enumerate them here. Firstly, 243 See for example Olivelle \(1996: 262\) and Radhakrishnan \(1994: 683\). 

244 Some of the uses of these terms in the Pāñcarātra literature are discussed in Rastelli \(2009\). 

245 See SS 7.69d, 77d, and 88a. As mentioned above, *tanmaya* can also be found as a proper noun designating the Ekāyanas at e.g. PauṣS 36.266b and PādS *cp* 11.243b\). 

246 These mantras are listed by Hikita \(1995; 2005\). 

144 

both chapters address the preparation for and performance of a temple-based *parārthapūjā* wherein professional priests officiate on behalf of a royal patron, here referred to simply as *ārādhaka* \(e.g. at SS 24.239d, 281c; 25.105d, 119b\). The royal patron’s “universal sovereignty” \(he is considered, in this respect, akin to Vāsudeva\) is hailed at the beginning of the 24th chapter.247 Conversely, the remainder of the SS 

is concerned not with the priestly performance of temple rituals for a fee-paying client \(on which see e.g. SS 24.54, 25.259ab\), but with the initiation ceremonies and, more extensively, the broad repertoire of “private” post-initiatory rites, in other words with worship “for onself” \( *svārthapūjā*\). This fact suggests that the final two chapters were simply appended to the text, and indeed the preceding chapters, which address the rules of conduct for initiates \(21-22\) and the selection of mantras for the *vibhava* forms of god \(23\), do not prepare the reader of the SS for this abrupt shift in focus. In addition, the naming of Ekāyanas, and the practice of explicitly identifying Vedic mantras by naming their source is absent from the remainder of the text. 

Although we cannot be certain, it seems probable that at least the final third of chapter 24 \(and possibly this chapter as a whole\) together with 25.1-294 were written specifically for inclusion within the SS, rather than having been incorporated *en bloc* from another work. This is not to say, of course, that passages within this portion of text could not have been incorporated from other texts.248 Rather, this section of the text more generally seems to have been authored, or at least thoroughly revised, in order to be incorporated into the larger work. This is indicated by the fact that it remains consistent throughout with what Smith \(1975: 515\) calls the “narrative framework” of the SS i.e. the dialogue between Lord Viṣṇu \(Bhagavat\) and Saṃkarṣaṇa as related by Nārada. This is evident, for instance, in the frequent use of 247 SS 24.16c-17c: *varṇāśramagurutvāc ca svāmitvād akhilasya ca* // *bhūtādidevarūpatvād uttamād* *yeṣu* *vastuṣu* / *nṛpaś*… //. Elsewhere in the SS \(e.g. at 5.98 and 7.77\), the “first god” \( *ādideva*\) is identified as Vāsudeva. 

248 The prayer to summon Viṣṇu into his four-faced material form at SS 25.119c-122 may well be drawn from an older source. Sanderson \(2009a: 109\) reports that these verses have been transmitted among Kashmirian Smārta Brahmins in modern times. Cf. the wording in this prayer with the description of the four-faced form of Śaktyātman or Śaktīśa at SS 12.9-19. 

145 

the vocative *lāṅgalin* \(“possessor of the plough”\) which is an epithet of Saṃkarṣaṇa.249 

The question as to when these chapters may have been added to our text remains very difficult to answer. While it is certainly possible that this redaction occurred in South India, there is not, as far as I am aware, any obvious indication of this. For instance there is no evidence, as far as I can see, that the author’s worldview has been influenced by ideas which would come to be labelled as 

“differentiated non-dualism” \( *viśiṣṭādvaita*\). Indeed, the clearest articulation of a philosophical stance which we find in chapters 24 and 25 indicates that our author’s outlook is in keeping, rather, with the dominant philosophical mode of the remainder of the SS, namely that of “difference and non-difference” \( *bhedābheda*\).250 This suggests that if these chapters were added to our text in South India, this is likely to have happened before the career of Rāmānuja \(twelfth century\), who was to exert such a profound influence on the Pāñcarātra traditions of this region. Such a suggestion also appears to find support in the fact that the appended chapters contain numerous passages wherein the goal of acquiring “perfections” or supernatural powers \( *siddhi*\) and worldly “enjoyments” \( *bhoga*\) is presented as being compatible with, or even a legitimate alternative to, the pursuit of liberation from *saṃsāra* \( *apavarga* or *mokṣa*\).251 For in the *bhakti*-oriented climate which succeeded the rise to prominence of Tamil Śrīvaiṣṇava communities, these goals were increasingly subordinated to the idea of liberation as god’s gracious reward for an attitude of devotional surrender. The SS’s closing *phalaśruti *\(25.379-384\), wherein rewards are promised for those who conceal the preceding Saṃhitā from non-devotees who are desirous of *bhoga*, is undoubtedly a still later addition to the text. 

249 See e.g. SS 24.397d, 414d; 25.172d, 185b, 188d, 232b, 266b. Conversely, the presence of the vocative *lāṅgalin* in the numerous parallel passages contained in the ĪS, and at PārS 15.594b, help us to establish that these passages have been borrowed from elsewhere, since Saṃkarṣaṇa does not feature in the “narrative frameworks” of these texts. 

250 See SS 25.148c-153. For examples of Bhedābhedavāda elsewhere in the SS see e.g. 2.72, 5.7-8, 5.81-82b, and 9.27. That said, as with the majority of Pāñcarātra Saṃhitās, there is not one consistent philosophical “position” undergirding the SS’s accounts of god’s relationship to the world. For imagery clearly indebted to the doctrine of “non-dualism” \( *advaita*\), for instance, see SS 4.33-35b. 

251 See e.g. SS 24.408ab, 25.2-3b, 229cd, 288, 308ab, 357b. However see also 25.367cd, wherein supernatural pleasures \( *bhoga*\) are graded below existence in “the abode of Acyuta”. 

146 

Lastly, it is notable that at the beginning of the final two chapters of the SS, it is claimed that members of all four *vaṛna* s may perform the construction of a “mantra-made form of god” \( *mantramayaṃ vapuḥ*, 24.2\), and the ritual wherein mantras are fixed onto the icon \( *mantrabimbaniveśana*, 25.1-2\). These statements obviously refer to the prospective “worshipper” \( *ārādhaka*\) or “patron” of the rituals which are about to be addressed. 

Finally, I turn to the PauṣS. Because this text is full of corrupted passages and missing portions and is, in its present state, even less of an homogeneous entity than is the SS, I will confine myself here to making some general observations on those passages which either directly or indirectly refer to the Ekāyanas. I have listed these observations separately in order to convey my opinion that the passages addressed should not necessarily be interpreted as belonging to a single authorial voice, or even to the perspective of a single Pāñcarātra tradition. 

1. The first use of the term *ekāyana* in the PauṣS is worthy of note because it occurs in a verse which closely resembles a verse in the SS. In both texts these verses occur in the context of the performance of the *śrāddha * ritual, wherein the worshipper presents offerings to his deceased ancestors. In the passage in the SS \(6.168c-169b\), the worshipper welcomes four Pāñcarātrika Brahmins \(to receive the offerings\) who are described as “having attained their goal in the supreme reality” \(… *caturo viniveśyāsaneṣu ca *// 

*labdhalakṣān pare tattve brāhmaṇān pāñcarātrikān */\). In the PauṣS 

\(27.166ab\), the “worthy recipient” who has “attained his goal in the supreme reality” is a twice-born Ekāyana \( *labdhalakṣaṃ pare tattve pātram ekāyanaṃ*

*dvijam *\(corr. *dvija*\) /\). 

2. Unlike the SS, the PauṣS contains several passages \(e.g. 31.149-150b, 38.41-46, 272-273b\) which bear witness to the type of Pāñcarātrika “sectarianism” 

which I have addressed in the previous chapter. In the following verses, the Ekāyanas are clearly described in opposition to the “mixed worshippers”. Part of this passage has been quoted above, I present a fuller version here: 147 

*jñātvaivaṃ bhaktisāṅkaryaṃ na kuryād evam eva hi *// *varjanīyaṃ*

*prayatnena ya icched uttamāṃ gatim */ * viprā ekāyanākhyā ye te bhaktās* *tattvato ’cyute *// *ekāntinaḥ sutattvasthā dehāntān nānyayājinaḥ */ 

*kartavyatvena ye viṣṇuṃ saṃyajanti phalaṃ vinā *// *prāpnuvanti ca* *dehānte vāsudevatvam abjaja */ *vyāmiśrayājinaś cānye bhaktābhāsās tu te* *smṛtāḥ *// *parijñeyās tu te viprā nānāmārgagaṇārcanāt */. – “Knowing thus \[i.e. that Puruṣottama is the “inner ruler” \( *antaryāmin*\) of all gods\], one should never perform mixed devotion. Indeed one who desires the supreme goal should avoid \[that\] with every effort. Those Brahmins that are called Ekāyanas are truly devotees of Acyuta. They who worship Viṣṇu as a duty \[that is\] without \(worldly\) fruit, worshipping no other 

\[god\], are Ekāntins who \[will\] exist in their true state after death. \[In other words\] at death they attain the state of Vāsudeva, O Lotus-born\! And the others are mixed worshippers - they are considered to be devotees in appearance only. Those Brahmins are \[easily\] recognised on account of their worshipping a multitude \[of inferior gods\] in various different ways.” 

\(36.259c-263b\) 

3. At PauṣS 31.286ab it is also said that the Ekāntins \(i.e. the Ekāyanas\) do not desire worldy fruits – here they are called *aphalārthin*. We can suppose that it is they who are referred to when the text speaks of “devotees without desires” \( *akāma*\) earlier in the same chapter \(31.203cd, 227cd\). In these instances, and elsewhere \(e.g. 36.80ab, 38.27ab\), they are contrasted with devotees “with desires” \( *sakāma*\). At 31.202c-203a, it is stated that “\[Rituals\] 

such as the sacrifice are known to grant only meagre fruits to worshippers with desires, even if they grant heaven” \( *kratuvat svalpaphaladā svargadā*

*yady api smṛtāḥ *// *sakāmānāṃ hi tatrāpi*…\). The worshippers without desires, meanwhile, are granted “the world of Acyuta” \( *acyutaloka*, 203cd\), or they are “united in the supreme self” \( *paramātmani saṃyojyam*, 227cd\). 

The mention of sacrifice \( *kratu*\) in the former instance would appear to identify the *sakāma* devotees with those “mixed worshippers” whose primary expertise lies in the Vedas \(27.711ab\). These Vaidikas/mixed worshippers are contrasted with the “Brahmins who worship no other \[god\]” \( *ananyayājin*, 27.710c\), or who “seek refuge in no other” \( *ananyaśaraṇa*, 36.78a\), and with Ekāntins who “know the Āgama” \( *āgamajña*, 32.72cd\). From these examples we can deduce the following: the Ekāyanas identify themselves as the legitimate heirs and custodians of the Pāñcarātra scriptural tradition; they 148 

worship Viṣṇu exlusively, and believe that non-Ekāyana Pāñcarātrins worship other gods in addition to Viṣṇu; they worship god because they consider it to be their duty \( *kartavya*\), rather than as a means of satisfying desires, and they consider themselves unique in this respect; they believe that they attain a higher goal after death than the other devotees; they like to call themselves Ekāntins. I will discuss this last term in Chapters Seven and Eight. 

4. As with South Indian Pāñcarātra works such as the PādS, the PārS and the ĪS 

etc., the PauṣS divides the Pāñcarātra tradition into four Siddhāntas \(38.293c-303b\). However, the PauṣS calls what is elsewhere known as the Āgamasiddhānta simply ‘Siddhānta’ \(32.35b, 38.293c-294c\). If this is accepted as the earliest extant account of the four Pāñcarātra Siddhāntas, this may indicate that ‘Siddhānta’ was in fact the original, or at least an early name of the Āgamasiddhānta. If this is the case, we might reasonably ask: could there be a link between this tradition and the ‘Pañcarātrasiddhāntins’ 

spoken of by Śaṅkara several centuries earlier? Given the distance in time between Śaṅkara and the South Indian Pāñcarātra Saṃhitās, it is unlikely that this question could be answered with any degree of certainty. However, it is worth restating the fact that Śaṅkara distinguishes between these Pañcarātrasiddhāntins and the ‘Bhāgavatas’, just as later scriptural works such as the PādS distinguish between Bhāgavatas and Āgamasiddhāntins. At any rate, the PauṣS \(38.293c-294\) states that this ‘Siddhānta’, wherein Brahmins worship god’s fourfold form “as a duty” \( *kartavyatva*\), is the first of the four Siddhāntas. Smith \(1975: 296\) suggests, quite correctly in my view, that this whole passage is an interpolation. 

5. PauṣS 38.307c-309 claims that that which is known as ‘Pañcarātra’ is also called ‘Sadāgama’, the “good” or “true” tradition, and it describes it as the 

“root” or “foundation” \( *mūla*\) which is superior to Purāṇa, Veda, Vedānta, Sāṃkhya and Yoga on account of the fact that it reveals a superior fruit, i.e. 

the supreme *brahman*. PārS 10.244c-245c contains a portion of this short 149 

passage, but in place of *pañcarātram iti smṛtam *\(at PauṣS 38.308d\) it has *ādyaṃ vedaṃ sanātanam *\(“the first eternal Veda”, PārS 10.244b\), by which it means the Ekāyanaveda. 

6. As with the SS, the PauṣS contains a short section \(relative to the text as a whole\) in which Ekāyana Brahmins \( *vipra*\) are named as participating in rites together with specialists in the four Vedas. This section of the PauṣS \(chapter 42\) also has the following points in common with the relevant passages of the SS: the Ekāyana/Vaidika participation occurs during the ritual of installation \( *pratiṣṭhā*\) related to the construction of a temple; the account occurs very near the end of the text \(in the case of the PauṣS it forms the penultimate chapter\); the Ekāyanas know the mantras of the fourfold form of god \( *cāturātmya*\) \(42.31cd\), and they are said to represent these forms in the ritual context \(42.125ab\); at the fire-sacrifice \( *homa*\) the Ekāyanas are seated in the cardinal directions, and the Vaidikas are seated in the ordinal directions \(42.331-32\); the Ekāyanas recite Vedic mantras \(42.145c-147b, 180\). 

7. In the final chapter of the PauṣS \(43.160cd\), the devotees who worship no other god \( *nānyayājin*\), who are elsewhere called ‘Ekāyana’ and ‘Ekāntin’, are said to include Brahmins, Kṣatriyas, Vaiśyas and Śūdras. 

8. Lastly, it is notable that in PauṣS 42 the preceptor is explicitly said to recite both Vedic and Pāñcarātrika mantras \(148-149b\), and also Ekāyana mantras \(188ab, 190cd\).
