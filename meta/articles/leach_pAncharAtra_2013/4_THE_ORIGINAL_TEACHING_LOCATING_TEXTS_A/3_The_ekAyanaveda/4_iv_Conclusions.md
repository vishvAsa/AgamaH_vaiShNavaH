Although there are references in the JS, SS and PauṣS to Ekāyana mantras and to 

“twice born” \( *dvija*\) Ekāyanas and Ekāyana Brahmins \( *vipra*\), and despite there being an indubitable link between the Pāñcarātrika Ekāyana tradition and Kashmir, as well as a possible allusion to the idea of the ‘Ekāyanaveda’ in Bhaṭṭa Jayanta’s ĀḌ,252 the earliest * * clear Pāñcarātrika references to an e *kāyanaśruti* or an e *kāyanaveda* occur only in the later, South Indian works, namely the ĀP, the PādS 

and the PārS. Moreover, among the passages in the JS, SS and PauṣS which refer to the Ekāyana recension and the Ekāyana Brahmins, those in the JS and SS are demonstrably later additions to these texts. We can be fairly sure that the passage in the JS which refers to mantras belonging to the Ekāyana *śākhā* is a product of South India, and it seems likely, owing to their many similarities, that SS 24-25 and PauṣS 

42 were composed in similar environments. 

The only portions of the JS and the SS which refer to the Ekāyana *śākhā*, or to Ekāyana Brahmins, occur within the context of prescriptions for installation rites in public temples. The PauṣS’s references to the Ekāyanas are more scattered, but PauṣS 42 also depicts them as participating in temple rituals with non-Ekāyana Pāñcarātrikas. Each of these text-portions \(i.e. JS 20.265-270, SS 24-25 and PauṣS 

42\) are bereft of any obvious indication of intra-Pāñcarātra sectarianism, and are thus at variance with other portions of the PauṣS, as well as with portions of the PādS and PārS which have been addressed earlier, wherein Ekāyana and non-Ekāyana Pāñcarātrins are very clearly at odds with one another. In the scriptural literature, references to an ‘Ekāyanaveda’ occur only in the latter context, which may indicate that this climate of sectarianism was already current in the time of Yāmuna, for he writes of an *ekāyanaśruti*, and describes the Ekāyana worship of god in accordance with the “five times” \( *pañcakāla*\) as the “single means” for attaining to the Bhagavat. 

252 At ĀD 4.139ab, the character known as Dairyarāśi refers to “the designation ‘Veda’ that people apply to the texts \( *vacana*\) of the Pañcarātra”. See Dezső \(2005: 237\).

The understanding of Ekāyana as meaning “the only way” also appears to have emerged during this period. This interpretation of the term appears to represent a signficant revision of the original sense of *ekāyana*, which very likely denoted a 

“single goal”. The origins of the Pāñcarātrika use of the term may go back to an explanation of the name Nārāyaṇa which is contained in the *Nārāyaṇīya*. The forthrightly exclusivist reading of *ekāyana* as “the only way” is, at any rate, very much at odds with the inclusive attitude displayed in the JS, wherein several distinct Vaiṣṇava denominations recite the Ekāyana mantras. Of course this scenario might not reflect the historical reality, but it can tell us something about the intentions of the author of this passage, which appear to be more consistent with the authors of the much later scriptural works such as the ŚrīprśS and the ŚrīpurS. In these texts, as we have seen, the term *ekāyana* is used to denote the Pāñcarātra in general, which also appears to be the case in JS 20.265-270. This may mean that this passage itself belongs to a much later period or, perhaps more likely, that the culture of Pāñcarātrika sectarianism was both succeeded and preceded by more “inclusive” and cooperative intra-Pāñcarātra relations. 

The question as to why a group of Pāñcarātrikas began to refer to an Ekāyanaveda, and to present the Ekāyana as the “only way” now needs to be asked. 

It seems probable that this question is linked also to why Pāñcarātrika redactors decided to add passages to the SS and the PauṣS in which Ekāyanas are shown to participate in public temple rites. These insertions were added, I propose, by authors who were eager to demonstrate that Ekāyanas were, contrary to what their rivals within the Pāñcarātra were claiming \(at e.g. PādS *cp* 21.43-46\), qualified to perform installation rites “for others” \( *parārtha*\), and that there was scriptural support for this. Moreover, the Ekāyanas considered themselves to be the “real” Pāñcarātrikas, and felt their status to be under threat on account of the fact that certain non-Ekāyana Pāñcarātrikas \(the “mixed worshippers”\) could claim association with the Veda. This may well have convinced the Ekāyanas to make a concerted effort to establish their own distinct religious identity, and to claim their own Veda.
