In her monograph on the *Paramasaṃhitā*, Marzenna Czerniak-Drożdżowicz \(2003: 37-41\) asks a pertinent question: how were scriptural claims of divine authorship reconciled with the reality of the situation in which the scriptural texts were being re-worked by successive scholars? “How was such a process of re-working possible?” 

she asks. “How could a text which claims to be the faithful record of god’s revelation be subjected to such manipulation?” She finds her answer, at least with regard to the *Paramasaṃhitā*, in the text’s admission of multiple lines of transmission: “The admission that the text of a tradition is an intermediate transmission of the revelation opens up the possibility of re-working it”, she writes. “Therefore the attitude towards the text was very special: the text presented the revelation, but as a record of the revelation and not the revelation itself it could be subjected to change.” 

Such an attitude towards the text is not, of course, unique to the Pāñcarātra. 

Epic and Purāṇic literature commonly presents itself also as an “intermediate transmission” in which a narrator, as distinct from the original author, recounts a story or sequence of events first heard elsewhere. Thus, in the opening *adhyāya* of the first book \( *ādiparvan*\) of the Sanskrit *Mahābhārata* \(MBh\) the bard Ugraśravas is presented as the epic’s narrator whilst its authorship is attributed to the seer \( *ṛṣi*\) Kṛṣṇa Dvaipāyana Vyāsa.181 The same Vyāsa is also frequently credited with the 181 The problematic question of Vyāsa’s “authorship” in the MBh’s presentation of itself is addressed by Fitzgerald \(2003\), who dicusses “how little the *MBh* itself seems to regard \[Vyāsa as its author\]” 

\(ibid.: 817\). However, as Fitzgerald points out in the same review, the Ugraśravas and Vaiśaṃpāyana framing passages do present Vyāsa as the author, or at least the *original* reciter \(MBh 1.1.9\), of the MBh. See also, for example, MBh 1.1.19, 191, and 205. [[107]]

composition of the Purāṇas,182 many of which are narrated by either Ugraśravas or his father Lomaharṣaṇa. Likewise, it is not Vālmīki, the author of the *Rāmāyaṇa*, who recites his own composition in the Sanskrit epic, but rather his pupils Lava and Kuśa, the twin sons of Rāma. This narrative technique whereby the original author of the text is distanced from its \(re-\)telling by a chain of transmission \( *paramparā * or *vaṃśa*\), is also used quite frequently in the Śaiva scriptural literature.183 Somewhat surprisingly, it is even encountered in an early Upaniṣad.184 It is a device which helps to establish the ancient pedigree of a text, and to ground it in a clearly delineated oral tradition,185 but it also establishes the text’s status as providing “a record of the revelation”, and as thereby being “subject to change”. 

The Pāñcarātra Saṃhitās employ a variety of techniques to establish their own 

“intermediate” status. A common strategy, found also in the epic, Purāṇic and Śāstric literature,186 involves the claim that the *present* form of the text is a condensation of its *original* form. Thus, in the opening chapter of the *Jayākhyasaṃhitā* \(1.70-75\), we are told that the current Saṃhitā comprises the essence \( *sāra*\) of an original teaching which ran to 15 million \( *sārdhakoṭi*\) *śloka* s. Likewise, in the opening chapter of the *Pādmasaṃhitā* \( *jp* 1.31-34\) we learn that the current Saṃhitā is a much shorter version of the 15 million *śloka* s taught to Brahmā by Keśava. In the *Lakṣmītantra* \(44.52\), Lakṣmī declares that the present version of the text is but the essence of the original *Lakṣmītantra* which consisted of a thousand million \( *śatakoṭi*\) *śloka* s. The *Paramasaṃhitā* \(1.45c-47\) also claims that its present form comprises merely the essence of its original form which consisted of “a hundred thousand chapters” 

\( *adhyāyalakṣam*\). Meanwhile, the *Ahirbudhnyasaṃhitā* \(1.70c-73\) contains the claim that it originally consisted of 240 *adhyāyas * before it was shortened to its present 60, while the 30-chapter *Viṣṇusaṃhitā* \(1.50-52\) declares that its original version 182 See, for example, *Bhāgavatapurāṇa* 1.3.40-1; *Viṣṇupurāṇa* 3.6.15 *ff*; *Agnipurāṇa* 271.11 *ff*; and *Vāyupurāṇa* 61.55 *ff*. Information from Rocher \(1986: 45 *ff*\).

[^184]: *Bṛhadāraṇyakopaniṣad* 2.6.1-3; 4.6.1-3; 6.5.1-4. 

[^185]: Doniger \(1993a: 32\) writes that “Epic and Purāṇic tradition \( *smṛti*\) defines itself by the chain of human memory, displaying each link as publicly as possible.” 

[^186]: See Pollock \(1985: 512-513\), who provides examples from the MBh \(12.59.13 *ff*\), the *Matsyapurāṇa* \(53.3-11\), Vātsyāyana’s *Kāmasūtra*, the *Mānasāra* and the *Carakasaṃhitā* among others. [[108]]

contained 108 chapters. In each instance this abridgement of the original teaching is presented as having taken place in order to benefit the recipients of the teaching. 

In the following, I analyse the varying ways in which Pāñcarātra authors derived the legitimacy of their own textual tradition from a text or a body of texts which, whether real or imagined, lay outside the canonical boundaries *of* *that* *tradition*. In other words, I shall be addressing Pāñcarātrika methods of appeal to transcendent textual sources. In particular, I intend to ask what such practices can tell us about the traditions in question. Why should one tradition favour this legitimating textual source over that one? In Chapter Four I address the idea that the Pāñcarātra teachings are “rooted in the Veda” \( *vedamūlatva*\). The majority of South Indian texts at my disposal subscribe to this idea, and I present an overview of the methods used by these works in their attempts to locate themselves within a tradition which is continuous with that of the Veda. In contrast to these, certain other Pāñcarātra texts, as we have seen above, make the claim that their scriptures are rooted in an original teaching called ‘Ekāyanaveda’. In Chapter Five I explore the tradition of the Ekāyanaveda, attempting to gather together textual clues as to the context of its emergence. Finally, in Chapter Six I address the idea of the original teaching found in the *Ahirbudhnyasaṃhitā*, and the ways in which this work legitimates the Pāñcarātra tradition *in toto* by appeal to the *Nārāyaṇīya*.
