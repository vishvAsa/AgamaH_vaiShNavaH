## bhAgavata, sattvata, pAncharAtra

## Doctrinal or ritual difference?
> That distinct groups within the Pāñcarātra should have held opposing views (as per rAmakaNTha) on the ontology of individual selves seems somewhat surprising given that in the Pāñcarātra literature that is currently available, such concerns do not figure prominently. Moreover, in the works by the Vedāntin defenders of Pāñcarātra orthodoxy, in the Vaikhānasa literature and, as we will see presently, in the Pāñcarātra scriptures, different types of Pāñcarātrika are distinguished from one another not on account of opposing philosophical positions, but rather because of such factors as their different religious goals, liturgical practices, social class \( *varṇa*\), customs, everyday habits, and religious insignia.
