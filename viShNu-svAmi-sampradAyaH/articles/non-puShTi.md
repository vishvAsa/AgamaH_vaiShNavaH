Regarding vishnu swami sect so honestly speaking it is now extinct only. No works etc are available of the original vishnu swami sect. Although people claim to be from Vishnu Swami, they don't have anything with them older than the 15th century.



> modern Day Vishnu Swamis that are NOT Pushti

## tIrtha-purohitas
Actually they are Tirtha Purohits of mathura kshetra. They trace their lineage to Brahmins mentioned in the bhagvatam of whom wives served Bhagvan. 

When Braj was restored in the 16th century and sampradayas were established so they claimed to be followers of Vishnu swami. 

They are also the official ritualists in Braj as many temples invite them including Gaudiyas on different occasions. But the quality is now declining and now it is very hard to find good Brahmins. Ritualists are very less in Braj now.

## haridAsi connection
Later when tatitya sthan ( Main centre of haridasi sampradaya) was established then they served as its main Acharya starting from lalit mohini dev ji till now all the heads have been from Chaturvedis only and now it is a sort of tradition that chaturvedis can only adorn all such positions.

They are associated with some temples of Braj. 

Srila Sanatan Goswami also received the madan mohan deity from the house of a chaturvedi. There are also claims that they are descendants of Indo Greeks.

## vAllabha-connection
They have given madhukari to many Gaudiya Acharyas. They were closely associated with pushtimarg and haridasi sampradaya. Govind swami and cit swami one of principle followers of Goswami Vitthalnath of Gokul were chaturvedis brahmins.

In Gopal peeth they teach works of vallabhacharya only. Now most chaturvedis are into haridasis and some are into pushtis. The only difference is that they get Brahma sambandh from vallabh kul and practice sadhana based on krsna mantra.

Chaturvedis have also served as Acharyas of Vallabh kul from rituals to teachings .
