Interesting thing, Bhaskara in Brahma sutra bhashya in support of his view of moksha, says those who follow Pancharatra also endorse his view on moksha. This once again shows Pancharatra is shastra just like Shruthi and smruthi. Just like Advaitins believe the agama teaches advaita, Dvaitins say the agama teaches dvaita, Bhaskara says the agama teaches bhedabheda. Nowhere Bhaskara similarly quotes agamas outside the vedas such as Pashupata, Shakta, etc.

Infact, Bhaskara in his Gita bhashya says that those who worship Rudra, Ganapati, etc are inferior to the worshippers of Vasudeva and devatantara worshippers do not attain moksha.
