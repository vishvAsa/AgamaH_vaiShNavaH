CHAPTER FIVE

The following summary of the fifth chapter is given by Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura in his *Amṛta-pravāha-bhāṣya.* Pradyumna Miśra, a resident of Śrīhaṭṭa, came to see Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu to hear from Him about Lord Kṛṣṇa and His pastimes. The Lord, however, sent him to Śrīla Rāmānanda Rāya. Śrīla Rāmānanda Rāya was training the *deva-dāsī* dancing girls in the temple, and when Pradyumna Miśra heard about this, he returned to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. The Lord, however, elaborately described the character of Śrīla Rāmānanda Rāya. Then Pradyumna Miśra went to see Rāmānanda Rāya again to hear about the transcendental truth from him.

A *brāhmaṇa* from Bengal composed a drama about the activities of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and went to Jagannātha Purī to show it to the associates of the Lord. When Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s secretary, Svarūpa Dāmodara Gosvāmī, heard the drama, he discerned a tinge of Māyāvāda philosophy and pointed it out to the author. Although Svarūpa Dāmodara condemned the entire drama, by reference to secondary meanings of the introductory verse he nevertheless satisfied the *brāhmaṇa.* That *brāhmaṇa* poet thus became greatly obliged to Svarūpa Dāmodara Gosvāmī, renounced his family connections and stayed at Jagannātha Purī with the associates of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

Thus although externally he appeared to be a man, internally, in his original spiritual position, he considered himself a maidservant and considered the two girls gopīs.**

### Purport

Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura writes in his *Amṛta-pravāha-bhāṣya:* “Śrīla Rāmānanda Rāya composed a drama named *Jagannātha-vallabha-nāṭaka,* and he engaged two young girls who were professional dancers and singers to demonstrate the ideology of the drama. Such girls, who are called *deva-dāsīs,* are still employed in the temple of Jagannātha, where they are called *māhārīs.* Śrī Rāmānanda Rāya engaged two such girls, and because they were meant to play the parts of *gopīs,* he taught them how to awaken thoughts like those of the *gopīs.* Because the *gopīs* are worshipable personalities, Rāmānanda Rāya, who considered the two girls *gopīs* and himself their maidservant, engaged in their service by massaging their bodies with oil to cleanse them completely. Because Rāmānanda Rāya always placed himself in the position of a maidservant of the *gopīs,* his rehearsal with the girls was actually on the spiritual platform.”

Because there was no question of personal sense gratification when Śrī Rāmānanda Rāya was serving the girls, his mind was steady and his body untransformed. This is not to be imitated, nor is such a mentality possible for anyone but Śrī Rāmānanda Rāya, as Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu will explain. The example of Śrī Rāmānanda Rāya is certainly unique. The author of *Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta* has given this description because in perfect devotional service one can attain such a position. Nevertheless, one must understand this subject very seriously and never attempt to imitate such activities.

### Translation

### Purport

Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura comments in this connection, “Any person seriously inclined to hear about the pastimes of Kṛṣṇa’s *rāsa* dance, as mentioned in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,* with great faith and a transcendental, spiritually inspired mind, is immediately freed from the natural lusty desires found within the heart of a materialistic man.”

When a pure Vaiṣṇava speaks on *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* and another pure Vaiṣṇava hears *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* from such a realized soul, both of them live in the transcendental world, where the contamination of the modes of material nature cannot touch them. Freed from the contamination of the modes of nature, the speaker and hearer are fixed in a transcendental mentality, knowing that their position on the transcendental platform is to serve the Supreme Lord. The class of men known as *prākṛta-sahajiyās,* who consider the transcendental pastimes of Lord Kṛṣṇa something like the behavior between a man and a woman in the material field, artificially think that hearing the *rāsa-līlā* will help them by diminishing the lusty desires of their diseased hearts. But because they do not follow the regulative principles but instead violate even ordinary morals, their contemplation of *rāsa-līlā* is a futile attempt, which sometimes results in their imitating the dealings of the *gopīs* and Lord Kṛṣṇa. To forbid such habits of the *prākṛta-sahajiyās,* Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu has excluded their material intelligence by using the word *viśvāsa* (“faith”). In *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (10.33.30), Śrīla Śukadeva Gosvāmī says:

*naitat samācarej jātu* *manasāpi hy anīśvaraḥ  
vinaśyaty ācaran mauḍhyād* *yathā rudro ’bdhijaṁ viṣam*

“Certainly one who is not the Supreme Personality of Godhead should never, even within his mind, imitate the activities of the transcendental *rāsa-līlā* of Kṛṣṇa. If out of ignorance one does so, he will be destroyed, just as if he were to imitate Lord Śiva, who drank poison produced from the ocean.”

### Translation

**“ ‘A transcendentally sober person who, with faith and love, continually hears from a realized soul about the activities of Lord Kṛṣṇa in His rāsa dance with the gopīs, or one who describes such activities, can attain full transcendental devotional service at the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus lusty material desires, which are the heart disease of all materialistic persons, are for him quickly and completely vanquished.’**

### Purport

All the activities of Lord Kṛṣṇa are transcendental, and the *gopīs* are also transcendentally situated. Therefore the activities of the *gopīs* and Lord Kṛṣṇa, if seriously understood, will certainly free one from material attachment. Then there is no possibility that lusty material desires will awaken.

It is so spiritually exalted that it cannot be expressed in words. Such a person is an eternally liberated associate of the Lord, and his body is completely spiritualized. Although he is visible to material eyes, he is spiritually situated, and all his activities are spiritual. By the will of Kṛṣṇa, such a devotee is understood to possess a spiritual body.**

**“I cannot properly describe the discourses of Rāmānanda Rāya, for he is not an ordinary human being. He is fully absorbed in the devotional service of the Lord.**

### Purport

One is forbidden to accept the *guru,* or spiritual master, as an ordinary human being (*guruṣu nara-matiḥ*)*.* When Rāmānanda Rāya spoke to Pradyumna Miśra, Pradyumna Miśra could understand that Rāmānanda Rāya was not an ordinary human being. A spiritually advanced person who is authorized to act as the spiritual master speaks as the Supreme Personality of Godhead dictates from within. Thus it is not he that is personally speaking. In other words, when a pure devotee or spiritual master speaks, what he says should be accepted as having been directly spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the *paramparā* system.

### Translation

**Although Rāmānanda Rāya was a householder, he was not under the control of the six kinds of bodily changes. Although apparently a pounds-and-shillings man, he advised even persons in the renounced order.**

### Purport

Śrī Rāmānanda Rāya externally appeared to be a *gṛhastha* who was under the influence of the external, material energy, not a self-controlled *brahmacārī, vānaprastha* or *sannyāsī. Gṛhasthas* (householders) who are under the influence of the external energy accept householder life for the purpose of sense enjoyment, but a transcendentally situated Vaiṣṇava is not subjected to the influence of the senses by the Lord’s material rule of the six kinds of bodily changes (*kāma, krodha, lobha, moha, mada* and *mātsarya*), even when he plays the part of a *gṛhastha.* Thus although Śrīla Rāmānanda Rāya acted as a *gṛhastha* and was accepted as an ordinary pounds-and-shillings man, he was always absorbed in the transcendental pastimes of Lord Kṛṣṇa. Therefore his mind was spiritually situated, and he was interested only in the subject of Kṛṣṇa. Rāmānanda Rāya was not among the Māyāvādī impersonalists or materialistic logicians who are opposed to the principles of Lord Kṛṣṇa’s transcendental pastimes. He was already spiritually situated in the order of renounced life; therefore he was able to turn sand into gold by spiritual potency, or, in other words, to elevate a person from a material to a spiritual position.

### Translation

**To vanquish the false pride of so-called renunciants and learned scholars, He spreads real religious principles, even through a śūdra, or lowborn, fourth-class man.**

### Purport

When a man is greatly learned in the *Vedānta-sūtras,* he is known as a *paṇḍita,* or learned scholar. Generally this qualification is attributed to *brāhmaṇas* and *sannyāsīs. Sannyāsa,* the renounced order of life, is the topmost position for a *brāhmaṇa,* a member of the highest of the four *varṇas* (*brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya and śūdra*)*.* According to public opinion, a person born in a *brāhmaṇa* family, duly reformed by the purificatory processes and properly initiated by a spiritual master, is an authority on Vedic literature. When such a person is offered the *sannyāsa* order, he comes to occupy the topmost position. The *brāhmaṇa* is supposed to be the spiritual master of the other three *varṇas,* namely *kṣatriya, vaiśya* and *śūdra,* and the *sannyāsī* is supposed to be the spiritual master even of the exalted *brāhmaṇas.*

Generally *brāhmaṇas* and *sannyāsīs* are very proud of their spiritual positions. Therefore, to cut down their false pride, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu preached Kṛṣṇa consciousness through Rāmānanda Rāya, who was neither a member of the renounced order nor a born *brāhmaṇa.* Indeed, Śrī Rāmānanda Rāya was a *gṛhastha* belonging to the *śūdra* class, yet Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu arranged for him to be the master who taught Pradyumna Miśra, a highly qualified *brāhmaṇa* born in a *brāhmaṇa* family. Even Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu Himself, although belonging to the renounced order, took instruction from Śrī Rāmānanda Rāya. In this way Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu exhibited His opulence through Śrī Rāmānanda Rāya. That is the special significance of this incident.

According to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s philosophy, *yei kṛṣṇa-tattva-vettā, sei ‘guru’ haya:* anyone who knows the science of Kṛṣṇa can become a spiritual master, without reference to whether or not he is a *brāhmaṇa* or *sannyāsī*. Ordinary people cannot understand the essence of *śāstra,* nor can they understand the pure character, behavior and abilities of strict followers of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s principles. The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is creating pure, exalted Vaiṣṇavas even from those born in families considered lower than those of *śūdras.* This is proof that a Vaiṣṇava may appear in any family, as confirmed in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (2.4.18):

*kirāta-hūṇāndhra-pulinda-pulkaśā *
 *ābhīra-śumbhā yavanāḥ khasādayaḥ  
ye ’nye ca pāpā yad-apāśrayāśrayāḥ *
 *śudhyanti tasmai prabhaviṣṇave namaḥ*

“Kirātas, Hūṇas, Āndhras, Pulindas, Pulkaśas, Ābhīras, Śumbhas, Yavanas and members of the Khasa races, and even others addicted to sinful acts, can be purified by taking shelter of the devotees of the Lord, due to His being the supreme power. I beg to offer my respectful obeisances unto Him.” (*Bhāg.* 2.4.18) By the grace of the Supreme Lord Viṣṇu, anyone can be completely purified, become a preacher of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and become the spiritual master of the entire world. This principle is accepted in all Vedic literature. Evidence can be quoted from authoritative *śāstras* showing how a lowborn person can become the spiritual master of the entire world. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is to be considered the most munificent personality, for He distributes the real essence of the Vedic *śāstras* to anyone who becomes qualified by becoming His sincere servant.

*‘bhakti’, ‘prema’, ‘tattva’ kahe rāye kari’ ‘vaktā’

### Synonyms

### Translation

**Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu preached about devotional service, ecstatic love and the Absolute Truth by making Rāmānanda Rāya, a gṛhastha born in a low family, the speaker. Then Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu Himself, the exalted brāhmaṇa-sannyāsī, and Pradyumna Miśra, the purified brāhmaṇa, both became the hearers of Rāmānanda Rāya.**

### Purport

Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura says in his *Amṛta-pravāha-bhāṣya* that *sannyāsīs* in the line of Śaṅkarācārya always think that they have performed all the duties of *brāhmaṇas* and that, furthermore, having understood the essence of the *Vedānta-sūtra* and become *sannyāsīs,* they are the natural spiritual masters of all society. Similarly, persons born in *brāhmaṇa* families think that because they execute the ritualistic ceremonies recommended in the *Vedas* and follow the principles of *smṛti,* they alone can become spiritual masters of society. These highly exalted *brāhmaṇas* think that unless one is born in a *brāhmaṇa* family, one cannot become a spiritual master and teach the Absolute Truth. To cut down the pride of these birthright *brāhmaṇas* and Māyāvādī *sannyāsīs,* Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu proved that a person like Rāmānanda Rāya, although born in a *śūdra* family and situated in the *gṛhastha-āśrama,* can become the spiritual master of such exalted personalities as Himself and Pradyumna Miśra. This is the principle of the Vaiṣṇava cult, as evinced in the teachings of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. A person who knows what is spiritual and what is material and who is firmly fixed in the spiritual position can be *jagad-guru,* the spiritual master of the entire world. One cannot become *jagad-guru* simply by advertising oneself as *jagad-guru* without knowing the essential principles for becoming *jagad-guru.* Even people who never see what a *jagad-guru* is and never talk with other people become puffed-up *sannyāsīs* and declare themselves *jagad-gurus.* Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu did not like this. Any person who knows the science of Kṛṣṇa and who is fully qualified in spiritual life can become *jagad-guru.* Thus Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu personally took lessons from Śrī Rāmānanda Rāya and also sent Pradyumna Miśra, an exalted *brāhmaṇa,* to take lessons from him.

Now that same mercy is overflooding the entire world through the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. The present Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is nondifferent from the pastimes performed by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu when He was personally present, for the same principles are being followed and the same actions performed without fail.

“A mellow temporarily appearing transcendental but contradicting mellows previously stated and lacking some of a mellow’s necessities is called *rasābhāsa,* an overlapping mellow, by advanced devotees who know how to taste transcendental mellows. Such mellows are called *uparasa* (submellows), *anurasa* (imitation transcendental mellows) and *aparasa* (opposing transcendental mellows). Thus the overlapping of transcendental mellows is described as being first grade, second grade or third grade. When the twelve mellows — such as neutrality, servitorship and friendship — are characterized by adverse *sthāyi-bhāva, vibhāva* and *anubhāva* ecstasies, they are known as *uparasa,* submellows. When the seven indirect transcendental mellows and the dried-up mellow of neutrality are produced by devotees and moods not directly related to Kṛṣṇa and devotional service in ecstatic love, they are described as *anurasa,* imitation mellows. If Kṛṣṇa and the enemies who harbor feelings of opposition toward Him are respectively the object and abodes of the mellow of laughter, the resulting feelings are called *aparasa,* opposing mellows. Experts in distinguishing one mellow from another sometimes accept some overlapping transcendental mellows (*rasābhāsa*) as *rasas* due to their being pleasurable and tasteful.” Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura says, *paraspara-vairayor yadi yogas tadā rasābhāsaḥ:* “When two opposing transcendental mellows overlap, they produce *rasābhāsa,* or an overlapping of transcendental mellows.”

tathā dehāntara-prāptir* *dhīras tatra na muhyati*

“As the embodied soul continuously passes, in this body, from boyhood to youth to old age, the soul similarly passes into another body at death. A sober person is not bewildered by such a change.” For the ordinary living being in material existence there is a division or distinction between the body and the owner of the body. In spiritual existence, however, there is no such distinction, for the body is the owner himself and the owner is the body itself. In spiritual existence, everything must be spiritual. Therefore there is no distinction between the body and its owner.

### Purport

If one thinks that the form of Lord Jagannātha is an idol made of wood, he immediately brings ill fortune into his life. According to the direction of the *Padma Purāṇa, arcye viṣṇau śilā-dhīḥ* *.* *.* *.* *yasya vā nārakī saḥ:* “Anyone who considers the Deity in the temple to be made of stone or wood is a resident of hell.” Thus one who thinks that the body of Lord Jagannātha is made of matter and who distinguishes between Lord Jagannātha’s body and His soul is condemned, for he is an offender. A pure devotee who knows the science of Kṛṣṇa consciousness makes no distinction between Lord Jagannātha and His body. He knows that they are identical, just as Lord Kṛṣṇa and His soul are one and the same. When one’s eyes are purified by devotional service performed on the spiritual platform, one can actually envision Lord Jagannātha and His body as being completely spiritual. The advanced devotee, therefore, does not see the worshipable Deity as having a soul within a body like an ordinary human being. There is no distinction between the body and the soul of Lord Jagannātha, for Lord Jagannātha is *sac-cid-ānanda-vigraha,* just as the body of Kṛṣṇa is *sac-cid-ānanda-vigraha.* There is actually no difference between Lord Jagannātha and Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, but the ignorant poet from Bengal applied a material distinction to the body of Lord Śrī Jagannātha.

### Translation

**“You have calculated Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, who is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, full in six opulences, to be on the level of an ordinary living being. Instead of knowing Him as the supreme fire, you have accepted Him as a spark.”**

### Purport

In the *Upaniṣads* it is said, *yathāgner visphuliṅgā vyuccaranti:* the living entities are like sparks of fire, and His Lordship the Supreme Personality of Godhead is considered the original great fire. When we hear this *śruti-vākya,* or message from the *Vedas,* we should understand the distinction between the Supreme Lord Kṛṣṇa and the living entities. A person under the control of the external energy, however, cannot understand that distinction. Such a person cannot understand that the Supreme Person is the original great fire, whereas the living entities are simply small fragmental parts of that Supreme Personality of Godhead. As Kṛṣṇa says in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (15.7):

*mamaivāṁśo jīva-loke* *jīva-bhūtaḥ sanātanaḥ  
manaḥ-ṣaṣṭhānīndriyāṇi* *prakṛti-sthāni karṣati*

“The living entities in this conditioned world are My eternal fragmental parts. Due to conditioned life, they are struggling very hard with the six senses, which include the mind.”

There is a distinction between the body and the soul of the materially existing living being, but because Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and Lord Jagannātha do not possess material bodies, there is no distinction between Their bodies and souls. On the spiritual platform, body and soul are identical; there is no distinction between them. As stated in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (1.11.38):

*etad īśanam īśasya* *prakṛti-stho ’pi tad-guṇaiḥ  
na yujyate sadātma-sthair* *yathā buddhis tad-āśrayā*

“This is the divinity of the Personality of Godhead. He is not affected by the qualities of material nature, even though He is in contact with them. Similarly, the devotees who have taken shelter of the Lord cannot be influenced by the material qualities.” His Lordship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, is unaffected by the influence of the three modes of material nature. Indeed, His devotees are also unpolluted by the influence of the external energy because they engage in the service of His Lordship. Even the very body of a devotee becomes spiritualized, just as an iron rod put into fire becomes as qualified as fire because it becomes red hot and will immediately burn anything it touches. Therefore the poet from Bengal committed a great offense by treating Lord Jagannātha’s body and Lord Jagannātha, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as two different entities, material and spiritual, as if the Lord were an ordinary living being. The Lord is always the master of the material energy; therefore He is not doomed to be covered by the material energy like an ordinary living entity.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara continued, “Because you have committed an offense to Lord Jagannātha and Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, you will attain a hellish destination. You do not know how to describe the Absolute Truth, but nevertheless you have tried to do so. Therefore you must be condemned.**

### Purport

The *brāhmaṇa* poet from Bengal was an offender in the estimation of Svarūpa Dāmodara Gosvāmī, for although the poet had no knowledge of the Absolute Truth, he had nevertheless tried to describe it. The Bengali poet was an offender to both Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and Lord Jagannātha. Because he had made a distinction between Lord Jagannātha’s body and His soul and because he had indicated that Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was different from Lord Jagannātha, he had committed offenses to Them both. *A-tattva-jña* refers to one who has no knowledge of the Absolute Truth or who worships his own body as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If an *ahaṅgrahopāsaka-māyāvādī,* a person engaged in fruitive activities or a person interested only in sense gratification describes the Absolute Truth, he immediately becomes an offender.

### Translation

**“You are in complete illusion, for you have distinguished between the body and the soul of His Lordship \[Lord Jagannātha or Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu\]. That is a great offense.**

### Purport

When one differentiates between the body and the soul of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he immediately becomes an offender. Because the living entities in the material world are generally covered by material bodies, the body and the soul of an ordinary human being cannot be identical. The Supreme Lord bestows the fruits of one’s activities, for He is the Lord of the results of fruitive action. He is also the cause of all causes, and He is the master of the material energy. Therefore He is supreme. An ordinary living being, however, in his material condition, experiences the results of his own fruitive activities and therefore falls under their influence. Even in the liberated stage of *brahma-bhūta* identification, he engages in rendering service to His Lordship. Thus there are distinctions between an ordinary human being and the Supreme Lord. *Karmīs* and *jñānīs* who ignore these distinctions are offenders against the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

An ordinary human being is prone to be subjugated by the material energy, whereas His Lordship the Supreme Personality of Godhead — Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Lord Kṛṣṇa or Lord Jagannātha — is always the master of the material energy and is therefore never subject to its influence. His Lordship the Supreme Personality of Godhead has an unlimited spiritual identity, never to be broken, whereas the consciousness of the living entity is limited and fragmented. The living entities are fragmental portions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead eternally (*mamaivāṁśo jīva-loke jīva-bhūtaḥ sanātanaḥ*)*.* It is not that they are covered by the material energy in conditioned life but become one with the Supreme Personality of Godhead when freed from the influence of material energy. Such an idea is offensive.

According to the considerations of Māyāvādī fools, the Supreme Personality of Godhead accepts a material body when He appears in the material world. A Vaiṣṇava, however, knows perfectly well that for Kṛṣṇa, Lord Jagannātha or Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu — unlike for ordinary human beings — there is no distinction between the body and the soul. Even in the material world His Lordship retains His spiritual identity; therefore Lord Kṛṣṇa exhibited all opulences even in His childhood body. There is no distinction between the body and the soul of Kṛṣṇa; whether He is in His childhood body or His youthful body, He is always identical with His body. Even though Kṛṣṇa appears like an ordinary human being, He is never subjected to the rules and regulations of the material world. He is *svarāṭ,* or fully independent. He can appear in the material world, but contrary to the offensive conclusion of the Māyāvāda school, He has no material body. In this connection one may again refer to the above-mentioned verse from *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (1.11.38):

*etad īśanam īśasya* *prakṛti-stho ’pi tad-guṇaiḥ  
na yujyate sadātma-sthair* *yathā buddhis tad-āśrayā*

The Supreme Person has an eternal spiritual body. If one tries to distinguish between the body and the soul of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he commits a great offense.

svarūpa, deha, — cid-ānanda, nāhika vibheda*

### Synonyms

*īśvarera* — of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; *nāhi* — there is not; *kabhu* — at any time; *deha*-*dehi*-*bheda* — distinction between the body and the soul; *svarūpa* — personal identity; *deha* — body; *cit*-*ānanda* — all made of blissful spiritual energy; *nāhika* *vibheda* — there is no distinction.

### Translation

**“At no time is there a distinction between the body and the soul of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. His personal identity and His body are made of blissful spiritual energy. There is no distinction between them.**

### Purport

Lord Kṛṣṇa, the son of Nanda Mahārāja, is *advaya-jñāna;* in other words, there is no distinction between His body and His soul, for His existence is completely spiritual. According to the verse from *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* beginning with the words *vadanti tat tattva-vidas tattvam* (1.2.11), the Absolute Truth is always to be understood from three angles of vision as Brahman, Paramātmā and Bhagavān. Unlike the objects of the material world, however, the Absolute Truth is always one and always the same. Thus there is no distinction between His body and His soul. His form, name, attributes and pastimes, therefore, are completely distinct from those of the material world. One should know perfectly well that there is no difference between the body and the soul of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When one conceives of a distinction between His body and His soul, one is immediately conditioned by material nature. Because a person in the material world makes such distinctions, he is called *baddha-jīva,* a conditioned soul.

I surrender unto You because, whereas I am proud of my material body and senses, Your Lordship is the cause of the cosmic manifestation. Yet You are untouched by matter.**

### Purport

**“** **‘This present form, or any transcendental form expanded by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, is equally auspicious for all the universes. Since You have manifested this eternal personal form, upon whom Your devotees meditate, I therefore offer my respectful obeisances unto You. Those who are destined to be dispatched to the path of hell neglect Your personal form because of speculating on material topics.’**

These verses from *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (3.9.3-4) were spoken by Lord Brahmā.

### Synonyms

### Translation

**“Whereas Kṛṣṇa, the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is full of transcendental bliss, possesses all six spiritual opulences in full, and is the master of the material energy, the small conditioned soul, who is always unhappy, is the servant of the material energy.**

### Purport

The living entity is an ever-conditioned servant of the material energy, whereas Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the master of the material energy. How, then, could they be on an equal level? There can be no comparison between them. His Lordship is always in a happy condition of transcendental bliss, whereas the conditioned soul is always unhappy because of his contact with the material energy. The Supreme Lord controls the material energy, and the material energy controls the conditioned souls. There is therefore no comparison between the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the ordinary living entities.

### Purport

Herein Svarūpa Dāmodara Gosvāmī instructs the poet from Bengal to hear *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* from a pure Vaiṣṇava and learn from him. In India especially, there is now a class of professional *Bhāgavatam* readers whose means of livelihood is to go from village to village, town to town, reading *Bhāgavatam* and collecting *dakṣiṇā,* or rewards, in the form of money or goods, like umbrellas, cloth and fruit. Thus there is now a system of *Bhāgavata* business, with recitations called *bhāgavata-saptāha* that continue for one week, although this is not mentioned in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.* Nowhere does *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* say that the *Bhāgavatam* should be heard for one week from professionals. Rather, *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (1.2.17) says, *śṛṇvatāṁ sva-kathāḥ kṛṣṇaḥ puṇya-śravaṇa-kīrtanaḥ:* one should regularly hear *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* from a self-realized Vaiṣṇava. By such hearing, one becomes pious: *hṛdy antaḥ-stho hy abhadrāṇi vidhunoti suhṛt satām.* As one thus hears the *Bhāgavatam* regularly and sincerely, his heart is purified of all material contamination:

*naṣṭa-prāyeṣv abhadreṣu* *nityaṁ bhāgavata-sevayā  
bhagavaty uttama-śloke* *bhaktir bhavati naiṣṭhikī*

“By regularly hearing the *Bhāgavatam* and by rendering of service to the pure devotee, all that is troublesome to the heart is almost completely destroyed, and loving service unto the Personality of Godhead, who is praised with transcendental songs, is established as an irrevocable fact.” (*Bhāg.* 1.2.18)

This is the proper process, but people are accustomed to being misled by professional *Bhāgavatam* reciters. Therefore Svarūpa Dāmodara Gosvāmī herein advises that one should not hear *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* from professional reciters. Instead, one must hear and learn the *Bhāgavatam* from a self-realized Vaiṣṇava. Sometimes it is seen that when a Māyāvādī *sannyāsī* reads the *Bhāgavatam,* flocks of men go to hear jugglery of words that cannot awaken their dormant love for Kṛṣṇa. Sometimes people go to see professional dramas and offer food and money to the players, who are expert at collecting these offerings very nicely. The result is that the members of the audience remain in the same position of *gṛham andha-kūpam,* family affection, and do not awaken their love for Kṛṣṇa.

In the *Bhāgavatam* (7.5.30), it is said, *matir na kṛṣṇe parataḥ svato vā mitho ’bhipadyeta gṛha-vratānām:* the *gṛha-vratas,* those who are determined to continue following the materialistic way of life, will never awaken their dormant love of Kṛṣṇa, for they hear the *Bhāgavatam* only to solidify their position in household life and to be happy in family affairs and sex. Condemning this process of hearing the *Bhāgavatam* from professionals, Svarūpa Dāmodara Gosvāmī says, *yāha, bhāgavata paḍa vaiṣṇavera sthāne:* “To understand the *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,* you must approach a self-realized Vaiṣṇava.” One should rigidly avoid hearing the *Bhāgavatam* from a Māyāvādī or other nondevotee who simply performs a grammatical jugglery of words to twist some meaning from the text, collect money from the innocent public, and thus keep people in darkness.

Svarūpa Dāmodara Gosvāmī strictly prohibits the behavior of the materialistic so-called hearers of *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.* Instead of awakening real love for Kṛṣṇa, such hearers of the *Bhāgavatam* become more and more attached to household affairs and sex life (*yan maithunādi-gṛhamedhi-sukhaṁ hi tuccham*)*.* One should hear *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* from a person who has no connection with material activities, or, in other words, from a *paramahaṁsa* Vaiṣṇava, one who has achieved the highest stage of *sannyāsa.* This, of course, is not possible unless one takes shelter of the lotus feet of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* is understandable only for one who can follow in the footsteps of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

### Translation

**Svarūpa Dāmodara continued, “Associate regularly with the devotees of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, for then only will you understand the waves of the ocean of devotional service.**

### Purport

It is clearly to be understood in this connection that the followers of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s way of devotional service are eternal associates of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and perfect knowers of the Absolute Truth. If one immediately follows the principles of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu by associating with His devotees, lusty desires for material enjoyment will vanish from one’s heart. Then one will be able to understand the meaning of *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* and the purpose of listening to it. Otherwise such understanding is impossible.

Svarūpa Dāmodara Gosvāmī informed the bengali poet, “Because of your ignorance and your leaning toward Māyāvāda philosophy, you cannot distinguish the difference between the Māyāvāda and Vaiṣṇava philosophies. Therefore the process you have adopted to praise Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and Lord Jagannātha does not follow the proper system; indeed, it is irregular and offensive. Fortunately, however, through your words, the goddess of learning, mother Sarasvatī, has tactfully offered her prayers to her master, Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.”
