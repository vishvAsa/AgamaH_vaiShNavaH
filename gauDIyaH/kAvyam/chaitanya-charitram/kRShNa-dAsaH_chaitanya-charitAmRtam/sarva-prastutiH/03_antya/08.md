CHAPTER EIGHT

The following summary of the eighth chapter is given by Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura in his *Amṛta-pravāha-bhāṣya.* This chapter describes the history of the Lord’s dealings with Rāmacandra Purī. Although Rāmacandra Purī was one of the disciples of Mādhavendra Purī, he was influenced by dry Māyāvādīs, and therefore he criticized Mādhavendra Purī. Therefore Mādhavendra Purī accused him of being an offender and rejected him. Because Rāmacandra Purī had been rejected by his spiritual master, he became concerned only with finding faults in others and advising them according to dry Māyāvāda philosophy. For this reason he was not very respectful to the Vaiṣṇavas, and later he became so fallen that he began criticizing Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu for His eating. Hearing his criticisms, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu reduced His eating, but after Rāmacandra Purī left Jagannātha Purī, the Lord resumed His usual behavior.

## Text 8

### Verse text

*paramānanda-purī kaila caraṇa vandana  
purī-gosāñi kaila tāṅre dṛḍha āliṅgana*

### Synonyms

*paramānanda*-*purī* — Paramānanda Purī; *kaila* — did; *caraṇa* — unto the feet; *vandana* — offering obeisances; *purī*-*gosāñi* — Rāmacandra Purī; *kaila* — did; *tāṅre* — unto him; *dṛḍha* — strong; *āliṅgana* — embracing.

### Translation

**Paramānanda Purī offered respects at the feet of Rāmacandra Purī, and Rāmacandra Purī strongly embraced him.**

### Purport

Because Rāmacandra Purī was a disciple of Mādhavendra Purī, both Paramānanda Purī and Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu offered him respectful obeisances. Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura comments that although Rāmacandra Purī was naturally very envious and although he was against the principles of Vaiṣṇavism — or, in other words, against the principles of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His devotees — common people nevertheless addressed him as Gosvāmī or Gosāñi because he was superficially in the renounced order and dressed like a *sannyāsī.* In the modern age the title *gosvāmī* is used by a caste of *gṛhasthas,* but formerly it was not. Rūpa Gosvāmī and Sanātana Gosvāmī, for example, were called *gosvāmī* because they were in the renounced order. Similarly, because Paramānanda Purī was a *sannyāsī,* he was called Purī Gosvāmī. By careful scrutiny, therefore, one will find that *gosvāmī* is not the title for a certain caste; rather, it is properly the title for a person in the renounced order.

### Translation

**Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu also offered obeisances unto Rāmacandra Purī, who then embraced Him and thus remembered Kṛṣṇa.**

### Purport

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu offered obeisances to Rāmacandra Purī in consideration of his being a disciple of Śrīla Mādhavendra Purī, the spiritual master of His own spiritual master, Īśvara Purī. When a Vaiṣṇava *sannyāsī* meets another Vaiṣṇava *sannyāsī,* they both remember Kṛṣṇa. Even Māyāvādī *sannyāsīs* generally remember Nārāyaṇa, who is also Kṛṣṇa, by saying *oṁ namo bhagavate nārāyaṇāya* or *namo nārāyaṇāya.* Thus it is the duty of a *sannyāsī* to remember Kṛṣṇa. According to *smṛti-śāstra,* a *sannyāsī* does not offer obeisances or blessings to anyone. It is said, *sannyāsī nirāśīr nirnamaskriyaḥ:* a *sannyāsī* should not offer anyone blessings or obeisances.

As stated in the *Bhagavad-gītā, brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā:* a Brahman realized person is always happy. *Na śocati na kāṅkṣati:* he neither laments nor aspires for anything. Not knowing why Mādhavendra Purī was crying, Rāmacandra Purī tried to become his advisor. Thus he committed a great offense, for a disciple should never try to instruct his spiritual master.

### Verse text

*śuni’ mādhavendra-mane krodha upajila  
‘dūra, dūra, pāpiṣṭha’ bali’ bhartsanā karila*

*śuni’* — hearing; *mādhavendra* — of Mādhavendra Purī; *mane* — in the mind; *krodha* — anger; *upajila* — arose; *dūra* *dūra* — get out; *pāpiṣṭha* — you sinful rascal; *bali’* — saying; *bhartsanā* *karila* — he chastised.

### Translation

**Hearing this instruction, Mādhavendra Purī, greatly angry, rebuked him by saying, “Get out, you sinful rascal!**

### Purport

Rāmacandra Purī could not understand that his spiritual master, Mādhavendra Purī, was feeling transcendental separation. His lamentation was not material. Rather, it proceeded from the highest stage of ecstatic love of Kṛṣṇa. When he was crying in separation, “I could not achieve Kṛṣṇa! I could not reach Mathurā!” this was not ordinary material lamentation. Rāmacandra Purī was not sufficiently expert to understand the feelings of Mādhavendra Purī, but nevertheless he thought himself very advanced. Therefore, regarding Mādhavendra Purī’s expressions as ordinary material lamentation, he advised him to remember Brahman because he was latently an impersonalist. Mādhavendra Purī understood Rāmacandra Purī’s position as a great fool and therefore immediately rebuked him. Such a reprimand from the spiritual master is certainly for the betterment of the disciple.

sei aparādhe iṅhāra ‘vāsanā’ janmila*

### Synonyms

*ei* — this; *ye* — that; *śrī*-*mādhavendra* *śrīpāda* — His Lordship Mādhavendra Purī; *upekṣā* *karila* — neglected or denounced; *sei* *aparādhe* — because of the offense; *iṅhāra* — of Rāmacandra Purī; *vāsanā* — material desire; *janmila* — arose.

### Translation

**Rāmacandra Purī was thus denounced by Mādhavendra Purī. Due to his offense, gradually material desire appeared within him.**

### Purport

The word *vāsanā* (“material desires”) refers to dry speculative knowledge. Such speculative knowledge is only material. As confirmed in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (10.14.4), a person without devotional service who simply wants to know things (*kevala-bodha-labdhaye*) gains only dry speculative knowledge but no spiritual profit. This is confirmed in the *Bhakti-sandarbha* (111), wherein it is said:

*jīvan-muktā api punar* *yānti saṁsāra-vāsanām  
yady acintya-mahā-śaktau* *bhagavaty aparādhinaḥ*

“Even though one is liberated in this life, if one offends the Supreme Personality of Godhead he falls down in the midst of material desires, of which dry speculation about spiritual realization is one.”

In his *Laghu-toṣaṇī* commentary on *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (10.2.32), Jīva Gosvāmī says:

*jīvan-muktā api punar* *bandhanaṁ yānti karmabhiḥ  
yady acintya-mahā-śaktau* *bhagavaty aparādhinaḥ*

“Even if one is liberated in this life, he becomes addicted to material desires because of offenses to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.”

A similar quotation from one of the *Purāṇas* also appears in the *Viṣṇu-bhakti-candrodaya:*

*jivān-muktāḥ prapadyante* *kvacit saṁsāra-vāsanām  
yogino na vilipyante* *karmabhir bhagavat-parāḥ*

“Even liberated souls sometimes fall down to material desires, but those who fully engage in devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead are not affected by such desires.”

These are references from authoritative revealed scriptures. If one becomes an offender to his spiritual master or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he falls down to the material platform to merely speculate.

### Verse text

*śuṣka-brahma-jñānī, nāhi kṛṣṇera ‘sambandha’  
sarva loka nindā kare, nindāte nirbandha*

### Synonyms

*śuṣka* — dry; *brahma*-*jñānī* — impersonalist philosopher; *nāhi* — there is not; *kṛṣṇera* — with Lord Kṛṣṇa; *sambandha* — relationship; *sarva* — all; *loka* — persons; *nindā* *kare* — criticizes; *nindāte* *nirbandha* — fixed in blaspheming.

### Translation

**One who is attached to dry speculative knowledge has no relationship with Kṛṣṇa. His occupation is criticizing Vaiṣṇavas. Thus he is situated in criticism.**

### Purport

Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura has explained in his *Anubhāṣya* that the word *nirbandha* indicates that Rāmacandra Purī had a steady desire to criticize others. Impersonalist Māyāvādīs, who have no relationship with Kṛṣṇa, who cannot take to devotional service, and who simply engage in material arguments to understand Brahman, regard devotional service to Kṛṣṇa as *karma-kāṇḍa,* or fruitive activities. According to them, devotional service to Kṛṣṇa is but another means for attaining *dharma, artha, kāma* and *mokṣa*. Therefore they criticize the devotees for engaging in material activities. They think that devotional service is *māyā* and that Kṛṣṇa or Viṣṇu is also *māyā.* Therefore they are called Māyāvādīs. Such a mentality awakens in a person who is an offender to Kṛṣṇa and His devotees.

### Synonyms

### Translation

**“Of the two rules, Rāmacandra Purī obeys the first by abandoning praise, but although he knows that the second is more prominent, he neglects it by criticizing others.**

### Purport

The above-mentioned verse from *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* gives two injunctions. The first, called *pūrva-vidhi,* is that one should not praise, and the second, *para-vidhi,* is that one should not criticize. As will be apparent from the following verse, the injunction against praise is less important than the injunction against blasphemy. One should carefully observe the *para-vidhi,* although one may neglect the *pūrva-vidhi.* Thus the actual injunction is that one may praise but should not criticize. This is called *śleṣokti,* or a statement having two meanings. Rāmacandra Purī, however, acted in just the opposite way, for he neglected the *para-vidhi* but strictly observed the *pūrva-vidhi.* Since he avoided following the principle of not criticizing, Rāmacandra Purī broke both the rules.
