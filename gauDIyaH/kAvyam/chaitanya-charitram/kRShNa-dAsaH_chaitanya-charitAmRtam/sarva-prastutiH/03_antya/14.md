CHAPTER FOURTEEN

Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura gives the following summary of the fourteenth chapter*.* Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s feelings of separation from Kṛṣṇa resulted in highly elevated transcendental madness. When He was standing near the Garuḍa-stambha and praying to Lord Jagannātha, a woman from Orissa put her foot on the Lord’s shoulder in her great eagerness to see Lord Jagannātha. Govinda chastised her for this, but Caitanya Mahāprabhu praised her eagerness. When Caitanya Mahāprabhu went to the temple of Lord Jagannātha, He was absorbed in ecstatic love and saw only Kṛṣṇa. As soon as He perceived this woman, however, His external consciousness immediately returned, and He saw Jagannātha, Baladeva and Subhadrā. Caitanya Mahāprabhu also saw Kṛṣṇa in a dream, and He was overwhelmed with ecstatic love. When He could no longer see Kṛṣṇa, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu compared Himself to a *yogī* and described how that *yogī* was seeing Vṛndāvana. Sometimes all the transcendental ecstatic symptoms were manifest in Him. One night, Govinda and Svarūpa Dāmodara noticed that although the three doors to the Lord’s room were closed and locked, the Lord was not present inside. Seeing this, Svarūpa Dāmodara and the other devotees went outside and saw the Lord lying unconscious by the gate known as Siṁha-dvāra. His body had become unusually long, and the joints of His bones were loose. The devotees gradually brought Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu back to His senses by chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra,* and then they took Him back to His residence. Once Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu mistook a sand dune known as Caṭaka-parvata for Govardhana Hill. As He ran toward it, He became stunned, and then the eight ecstatic transformations appeared in His body due to great love for Kṛṣṇa. At that time all the devotees chanted the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra* to pacify Him.

### Verse text

*svarūpa-gosāñi āra raghunātha-dāsa  
ei duira kaḍacāte e-līlā prakāśa*

### Synonyms

### Translation

**Svarūpa Dāmodara Gosvāmī and Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī recorded all these transcendental activities of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu in their notebooks.**

### Purport

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s transcendental feelings of separation from Kṛṣṇa and His consequent madness are not at all understandable by a person on the material platform. Nonetheless, a so-called party of devotees named *nadīyā-nāgarī* has sprung up and introduced the worship of Viṣṇupriyā. This certainly indicates their ignorance concerning Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s pastimes. In the opinion of Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura, such worship is a product of the imagination. Many other methods of worshiping Caitanya Mahāprabhu have also been introduced, but they have all been rejected by stalwart devotees like Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura. The groups practicing such unauthorized worship have been listed by Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura:

*āula, bāula, kartābhajā, neḍā, daraveśa, sāṅi,  
sahajiyā, sakhībhekī, smārta, jāta-gosāñi,  
ativāḍī, cūḍādhārī, gaurāṅga-nāgarī*

Svarūpa Dāmodara Gosvāmī and Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī witnessed Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s activities firsthand and recorded them in two notebooks. Therefore, without reference to these notebooks one cannot understand the activities of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Anyone inventing some new method for worshiping Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is certainly unable to understand the Lord’s pastimes, for he is bereft of the real process of approaching the Lord.

āra saba kaḍacā-kartā rahena dūra-deśe*

### Synonyms

*se*-*kāle* — in those days; *e*-*dui* — these two; *rahena* — stayed; *mahāprabhura* *pāśe* — with Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu; *āra* — other; *saba* — all; *kaḍacā*-*kartā* — commentators; *rahena* — remained; *dūra*-*deśe* — far away.

### Translation

**In those days, Svarūpa Dāmodara and Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī lived with Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, whereas all other commentators lived far away from Him.**

### Purport

Besides Svarūpa Dāmodara and Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī, there were many others who also recorded Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s activities. Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura believes that the people of the world would benefit greatly if such notes were available. It is a most unfortunate situation for human society that none of these notebooks is still extant.

### Purport

For future reference, we should remember that Svarūpa Dāmodara Gosvāmī recorded the pastimes briefly, whereas Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī recorded them elaborately. These two great personalities simply recorded the facts; they did not create any descriptive literary embellishments.

## Text 14

### Verse text

*rādhikāra bhāve prabhura sadā ‘abhimāna’  
sei bhāve āpanāke haya ‘rādhā’-jñāna*

### Synonyms

*rādhikāra* *bhāve* — in the emotion of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī; *prabhura* — of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu; *sadā* — always; *abhimāna* — conception; *sei* *bhāve* — under such a conception; *āpanāke* — upon Himself; *haya* — becomes; *rādhā*-*jñāna* — consideration as Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī.

### Translation

**Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s emotions exactly corresponded to those of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī when She met Uddhava. The Lord always conceived of Himself in Her position and sometimes thought that He was Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī Herself.**

### Purport

Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura explains that the purport of the word *abhimāna,* or “self-conception,” is that Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu thought Himself to be in the position of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī and was always ready to render Kṛṣṇa service in that way. Although Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is Kṛṣṇa Himself, He assumed the complexion and emotions of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī and remained in that status. He never assumed the complexion or status of Lord Kṛṣṇa. Of course, Kṛṣṇa wanted to experience the role of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī; that is the original cause of His assuming the body of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Therefore pure Vaiṣṇavas never disturb Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s conception of being Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī.

Unfortunately, at the present time a group of so-called devotees maintain that Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is the enjoyer and that they are enjoyers as well. They have actually deviated from devotional service to the Lord. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu manifested Himself to show that cultivation of love for Kṛṣṇa in separation is the easiest way of success for all living entities. Despite this fact, there are some theosophists who declare that because Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, such cultivation is easy for Him but difficult for the living entity and that one can therefore approach Kṛṣṇa in any way he likes. To nullify this idea, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu demonstrated practically how one can achieve love of Kṛṣṇa by adopting Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī’s mood in separation from Kṛṣṇa.

### Translation

**Such is the state of transcendental madness. Why is it difficult to understand? When one is highly elevated in love of Kṛṣṇa, he becomes transcendentally mad and talks like a madman.**

*etasya mohanākhyasya  
gatiṁ kām apy upeyuṣaḥ

### Translation

**“When the ecstatic emotion of enchantment gradually progresses, it becomes similar to bewilderment. Then one reaches the stage of astonishment \[vaicitrī\], which awakens transcendental madness. Udghūrṇā and citra-jalpa are two among the many divisions of transcendental madness.”**

### Purport

Because Garuḍa is the carrier of Lord Viṣṇu, he is the supreme Vaiṣṇava. Therefore to touch his body with one’s feet or to climb the column of Garuḍa is certainly a *vaiṣṇava-aparādha,* an offense to a Vaiṣṇava. The woman was also offensive to Kṛṣṇa by putting her foot on the shoulder of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Seeing all these offenses, Govinda very hastily made her get down.

The woman was so eager to see Lord Jagannātha that she forgot she was offending the feet of a Vaiṣṇava by climbing the column of Garuḍa. She also neglected to consider that by putting her foot on the shoulder of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, she offended the Supreme Personality of Godhead. These are both grievous offenses that displease the Supreme Lord and Vaiṣṇavas. She was so eager to see Lord Jagannātha, however, that she committed all these offenses obliviously. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu praised her eagerness; He regretted that Lord Jagannātha had not bestowed such great eagerness upon Him.

### Purport

These are the feelings of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī. First Lord Caitanya felt that He had been taken to Vṛndāvana, where He saw Kṛṣṇa’s *rāsa* dance with the *gopīs.* Then He was brought to Kurukṣetra to see Lord Jagannātha, His sister (Subhadrā) and Lord Balarāma. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu lost Vṛndāvana and Kṛṣṇa, the master of Vṛndāvana. At this time, Caitanya Mahāprabhu experienced *divyonmāda,* transcendental madness in separation from Kṛṣṇa. At Kurukṣetra, Kṛṣṇa displays His opulence, whereas in Vṛndāvana He is in His original position. Kṛṣṇa never goes even a step away from Vṛndāvana; therefore Kurukṣetra is less important for the *gopīs* than Vṛndāvana.

Although devotees who worship Kṛṣṇa in opulence (His Vaikuṇṭha aspect) may prefer to see Lord Kṛṣṇa at Kurukṣetra along with Subhadrā and Balarāma, the *gopīs* want to see Kṛṣṇa in Vṛndāvana, performing the *rāsa* dance with Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu showed by practical example how one can cultivate the mood of Rādhārāṇī and the other *gopīs* in separation from Kṛṣṇa. Devotees absorbed in this mood do not like to see Kṛṣṇa anywhere else but Vṛndāvana. Therefore Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu lamented, “I found Kṛṣṇa in Vṛndāvana, and now I have again lost Him and come to Kurukṣetra.” Unless one is a very highly advanced devotee, he cannot understand these intricate feelings. The author of *Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta,* however, has tried to explain this *divyonmāda* as far as possible, and it is our duty simply to appreciate it as far as possible. Therefore the author has made the following request in verse 11:

*tāte viśvāsa kari’ śuna bhāvera varṇana  
ha-ibe bhāvera jñāna, pāibā prema-dhana*

“My dear readers, simply try to hear this description with faith and love. That will help you understand transcendental ecstasy, and at last you will achieve love of Godhead very easily.”

“At Akrūra’s request, Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma left the house of Nanda Mahārāja for Mathurā. At that time the mind of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī was disrupted, and She became almost mad because of extreme separation from Kṛṣṇa. She experienced great mental pain and agitation, which caused Her to drown in mental speculation in the river of anxiety. She thought, ‘Now I am going to die, and when I die, Kṛṣṇa will surely come back to see Me again. But when He hears of My death from the people of Vṛndāvana, He will certainly be very unhappy. Therefore I shall not die.’ ” This is the explanation of the word *cintā.*

*Jāgara,* wakefulness*.* As stated in the *Padyāvalī* (326):

*yāḥ paśyanti priyaṁ svapne* *dhanyās tāḥ sakhi yoṣitaḥ  
asmākaṁ tu gate kṛṣṇe* *gatā nidrāpi vairiṇī*

Thinking Herself very unfortunate, Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī addressed Her very dear friend Viśākhā, “My dear friend, if I could see Kṛṣṇa in My dreams, I would certainly be glorified for My great fortune. But what can I do? Sleep also plays mischievously with Me. Indeed, it has become My enemy. Therefore I have not slept since the departure of Kṛṣṇa.”

*Udvega,* mental agitation*.* This word is explained in the *Haṁsa-dūta* (104) as follows:

*mano me hā kaṣṭaṁ jvalati kim ahaṁ hanta karavai *
 *na pāraṁ nāvāraṁ su-mukhi kalayāmy asya jaladheḥ  
iyaṁ vande mūrdhnā sapadi tam upāyaṁ kathaya me *
 *parāmṛśye yasmād dhṛti-kaṇikayāpi kṣaṇikayā*

Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī addressed Lalitā, “My dear beautiful-faced Lalitā, I cannot express how My heart is burning. It is a great, unfathomable ocean of anxiety. Still, I wish to offer My obeisances at your lotus feet. What shall I do? Please consider My condition and advise Me how I can become peaceful. That is My desire.”

*Tānava,* thinness, is described as follows:

*udañcad-vaktrāmbhoruha-vikṛtir antaḥ-kulaṣitā *
 *sadāhārābhāva-glapita-kuca-kokā yadu-pate  
viśuṣyantī rādhā tava viraha-tāpād anu-dinaṁ *
 *nidāghe kuly eva kraśima-paripākaṁ prathayati*

When Uddhava returned to Mathurā after visiting Vṛndāvana, Lord Kṛṣṇa inquired from him about Rādhārāṇī and Viśākhā. Uddhava replied as follows: “Consider the condition of the *gopīs*! Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī especially is in a very painful condition because of separation from You. She has grown skinny, and Her bodily luster is almost gone. Her heart is immersed in pain, and because She has given up eating, Her breasts have become black, as if diseased. Because of separation from You, all the *gopīs,* especially Rādhārāṇī, appear like dried-up water holes under the scorching heat of the sun.”

*Malina-aṅgatā,* uncleanliness, is described as follows:

*hima-visara-viśīrṇāmbhoja-tulyānana-śrīḥ *
 *khara-marud-aparajyad-bandhu-jīvopamauṣṭhī  
agha-hara śarad-arkottāpitendīvarākṣī *
 *tava viraha-vipatti-mlāpitāsīd viśākhā*

Uddhava said to Kṛṣṇa, “O most auspicious Kṛṣṇa, please hear me. The tribulation caused by Your absence has made Viśākhā languid. Her lips tremble like trees in a strong wind. Her beautiful face is like a lotus flower that has withered under the snow, and her eyes are like lotus petals scorched by the heat of the autumn sun.”

*Pralāpa,* mad talking, is explained in the *Lalita-mādhava* as follows:

*kva nanda-kula-candramāḥ kva śikhi-candra-kālaṅkṛtiḥ *
 *kva mandra-muralī-ravaḥ kva nu surendra-nīla-dyutiḥ  
kva rāsa-rasa-tāṇḍavī kva sakhi jīva-rakṣauṣadhir *
 *nidhir mama suhṛttamaḥ kva tava hanta hā dhig vidhiḥ*

This is Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī’s lamentation for Her beloved Kṛṣṇa, who was away from home. A woman whose husband has left home and gone to a foreign land is called *proṣita-bhartṛkā.* Lamenting for Kṛṣṇa in the same way that such a woman laments for her husband, Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī said, “My dear friend, where is the glory of the family of Mahārāja Nanda, who wears a half-moon ornament on His head? Where is Kṛṣṇa, whose hue is like that of the *indranīla* jewel and who plays so nicely on His flute? Where is your friend, the best of all men, so expert in dancing in the circle of the *rāsa* dance? Where is He who is the real medicine to save Me from dying of heart disease? I must condemn Providence, for he has caused Me so many tribulations by separating Me from Kṛṣṇa.”

*Vyādhi,* disease, is also described in the *Lalita-mādhava:*

*uttāpī puṭa-pākato ’pi garala-grāmād api kṣobhaṇo *
 *dambholer api duḥsahaḥ kaṭur alaṁ hṛn-magna-śūlyād api  
tīvraḥ prauḍha-visūcikāni cayato ’py uccair mamāyaṁ balī *
 *marmāṇy adya bhinatti gokula-pater viśleṣa-janmā jvaraḥ*

Being greatly afflicted by the pain of separation from Kṛṣṇa, Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī said, “My dear Lalitā, kindly hear Me. I cannot bear suffering the fever of separation from Kṛṣṇa, nor can I explain it to you. It is something like gold melting in an earthen box. This fever produces more distress than poison, and it is more piercing than a thunderbolt. I suffer exactly like someone almost dead from cholera. To be giving Me so much pain, this fever must be very strong indeed.”

*Unmāda,* madness, is explained as follows:

*bhramati bhavana-garbhe nirnimittaṁ hasantī *
 *prathayati tava vārtāṁ cetanācetaneṣu  
luṭhati ca bhuvi rādhā kampitāṅgī murāre *
 *viṣama-viraha-khedodgāri-vibhrānta-cittā*

Uddhava said to Kṛṣṇa, “My dear Kṛṣṇa, all the *gopīs* are so afflicted by Your absence that they have become almost mad. O Murāri, at home Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī laughs unnecessarily and, like a madwoman, inquires about You from every entity without distinction, even from the stones. She rolls on the ground, unable to bear the agony of Your absence.”

*Moha,* illusion, is explained as follows:

*nirundhe dainyābdhiṁ harati guru-cintā paribhavaṁ *
 *vilumpaty unmādaṁ sthagayati balād bāṣpa-laharīm  
idānīṁ kaṁsāre kuvalaya-dṛśaḥ kevalam idaṁ *
 *vidhatte sācivyaṁ tava viraha-mūrcchā-sahacarī*

Lalitā wrote Kṛṣṇa the following letter on Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī’s behalf: “My dear Kṛṣṇa, Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī has fallen unconscious on the ground, Her mind greatly agitated by Her separation from You. O enemy of Kaṁsa, You have now become a first-class politician, and therefore You can supposedly give relief to everyone. Therefore please consider the plight of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī, or very soon You will hear of Her death. Maybe at that time You will lament, although now You are jubilant.”

*Mṛtyu,* death, is explained in the *Haṁsa-dūta* (96):

*aye rāsa-krīḍā-rasika mama sakhyaṁ nava-navā *
 *purā baddhā yena praṇaya-laharī hanta gahanā  
sa cen muktāpekṣas tvam asi dhig imāṁ tūla-śakalaṁ *
 *yad etasyā nāsā-nihitam idam adyāpi calati*

In the following letter, Lalitā chastised Kṛṣṇa for staying in Mathurā: “Simply by dancing in the circle of the *rāsa* dance, You attracted Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī’s love. Why are You now so indifferent to my dear friend Rādhārāṇī? She is lying nearly unconscious, thinking of Your pastimes. I shall determine whether She is alive by putting a cotton swab under Her nostrils, and if She is still living, I shall chastise Her.”
