CHAPTER FIFTEEN

The following is a summary of the fifteenth chapter*.* After seeing the *upala-bhoga* ceremony of Lord Jagannātha, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu once more began to feel ecstatic emotions. When He saw the garden on the beach by the sea, He again thought that He was in Vṛndāvana, and when He began to think of Kṛṣṇa engaging in His different pastimes, transcendental emotions excited Him again. On the night of the *rāsa* dance, the *gopīs,* bereaved by Kṛṣṇa’s absence, searched for Kṛṣṇa from one forest to another. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu adopted the same transcendental thoughts as those of the *gopīs* and was filled with ecstatic emotion. Svarūpa Dāmodara Gosvāmī recited a verse from the *Gīta-govinda* just suitable to the Lord’s emotions. Caitanya Mahāprabhu then exhibited the ecstatic transformations known as *bhāvodaya, bhāva-sandhi, bhāva-śābalya* and so on. The Lord experienced all eight kinds of ecstatic transformations, and He relished them very much.
