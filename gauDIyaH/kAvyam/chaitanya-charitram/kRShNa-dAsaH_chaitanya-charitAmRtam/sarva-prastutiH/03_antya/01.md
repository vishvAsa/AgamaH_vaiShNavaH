CHAPTER ONE

A summary of the first chapter is given by Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura in his *Amṛta-pravāha-bhāṣya* as follows. When Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu returned to Jagannātha Purī from Vṛndāvana, all His devotees from other parts of India, upon receiving the auspicious news, came to Puruṣottama-kṣetra, or Jagannātha Purī. Śivānanda Sena took a dog with him and even paid fees for it to cross the river. One night, however, the dog could not get any food and therefore went directly to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu at Jagannātha Purī. The next day, when Śivānanda and his party reached Jagannātha Purī, Śivānanda saw the dog eating some coconut pulp offered to it by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. After this incident, the dog was liberated and went back home, back to Godhead.

Meanwhile, Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī reached Bengal, after returning from Vṛndāvana. Although he could not follow the Bengali devotees, after some time he also came to Jagannātha Purī, where he stayed with Haridāsa Ṭhākura. Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī composed an important verse beginning with the words *priyaḥ so ’yam,* and Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu relished it very much. One day Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Rāmānanda Rāya, Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya and others went to the place of Haridāsa Ṭhākura and heard some of the verses Rūpa Gosvāmī had composed for his books *Lalita-mādhava* and *Vidagdha-mādhava.* After examining the manuscripts of these two books, Rāmānanda Rāya approved and appreciated them very much. After the period of Cāturmāsya, all the devotees who had come from Bengal returned to their homes. Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī, however, remained at Jagannātha Purī for some time.

### Purport

If one wants to benefit the entire world, he will certainly find persons like hogs and pigs who will put forward many impediments. That is natural. But if a devotee seeks shelter at the lotus feet of the six Gosvāmīs, the merciful Gosvāmīs will certainly give the Lord’s servitor all protection. It is not astonishing that impediments are placed before those who are spreading the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement all over the world. Nevertheless, if we adhere to the lotus feet of the six Gosvāmīs and pray for their mercy, all impediments will be annihilated, and the transcendental devotional desire to serve the Supreme Lord will be fulfilled.

I started the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement at the age of seventy. Now I am seventy-eight, and so my death is imminent. I am trying to finish the translation of *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* as soon as possible, but before finishing it, I have given my readers the book *Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead,* so that if I die before finishing the whole task, they may enjoy this book, which is the essence of *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.*

### Translation

**Śivānanda Sena, unhappy that the dog had to stay behind, paid the boatman ten paṇa of conchshells to take the dog across the river.**

### Purport

One *paṇa* is eighty *kaḍis,* or small conchshells. Formerly, even fifty or sixty years ago, there was no paper currency in India. Coins were generally made not of base metal but of gold, silver and copper. In other words, the medium of exchange was really something valuable. Four pieces of *kaḍi* made one *gaṇḍā,* and twenty such *gaṇḍās* equaled one *paṇa.* This *kaḍi* was also used as a medium of exchange; therefore Śivānanda Sena paid for the dog with *daśa paṇa,* or eighty times ten pieces of *kaḍi.* In those days one paisa was also subdivided into small conchshells, but at the present moment the prices for commodities have gone so high that there is nothing one can get in exchange for only one paisa. With one paisa in those days, however, one could purchase sufficient vegetables to provide for a whole family. Even thirty years ago, vegetables were occasionally so inexpensive that one paisa’s worth could provide for a whole family for a day.

### Translation

**In the morning they looked for the dog, but it could not be found anywhere. All the Vaiṣṇavas were astonished.**

### Purport

Śivānanda Sena’s attachment to the dog was a great boon for that animal. The dog appears to have been a street dog. Since it naturally began to follow Śivānanda Sena while he was going to Jagannātha Purī with his party, he accepted it into his party and maintained it the same way he was maintaining the other devotees. It appears that although on one occasion the dog was not allowed aboard a boat, Śivānanda did not leave the dog behind but paid more money just to induce the boatman to take the dog across the river. Then when the servant forgot to feed the dog and the dog disappeared, Śivānanda, being very anxious, sent ten men to find it. When they could not find it, Śivānanda observed a fast. Thus it appears that somehow or other Śivānanda had become attached to the dog.

As will be evident from the following verses, the dog got the mercy of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and was immediately promoted to Vaikuṇṭha to become an eternal devotee. Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura has therefore sung, *tumi ta’ ṭhākura, tomāra kukkura, baliyā jānaha more* (*Śaraṇāgati* 19). He thus offers to become the dog of a Vaiṣṇava. There are many other instances in which the pet animal of a Vaiṣṇava was delivered back home to Vaikuṇṭhaloka, back to Godhead. Such is the benefit of somehow or other becoming the favorite of a Vaiṣṇava. Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura has also sung, *kīṭa-janma ha-u yathā tuyā dāsa* (*Śaraṇāgati* 11). There is no harm in taking birth again and again. Our only desire should be to take birth under the care of a Vaiṣṇava. Fortunately we had the opportunity to be born of a Vaiṣṇava father who took care of us very nicely. He prayed to Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī that in the future we would become a servant of the eternal consort of Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Thus somehow or other we are now engaged in that service. We may conclude that even as dogs we must take shelter of a Vaiṣṇava. The benefit will be the same as that which accrues to an advanced devotee under a Vaiṣṇava’s care.

### Translation

### Purport

This is the result of *sādhu-saṅga* — consequent association with Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and promotion back home, back to Godhead. This result is possible even for a dog, by the mercy of the Vaiṣṇava. Therefore, everyone in the human form of life should be induced to associate with devotees. By rendering a little service, even by eating *prasādam,* what to speak of chanting and dancing, everyone can be promoted to Vaikuṇṭhaloka. It is therefore requested that all our devotees in the ISKCON community become pure Vaiṣṇavas, so that by their mercy all the people of the world will be transferred to Vaikuṇṭhaloka, even without their knowledge. Everyone should be given a chance to take *prasādam* and thus be induced to chant the holy names Hare Kṛṣṇa and also dance in ecstasy. By these three processes, although performed without knowledge or education, even an animal went back to Godhead.

### Purport

One’s bodily luster and beauty, one’s constitution, one’s activities and one’s qualities all depend on the law of cause and effect. There are three qualities in material nature, and as stated in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (13.22), *kāraṇaṁ guṇa-saṅgo ’sya sad-asad-yoni-janmasu:* one takes birth in a good or bad family according to his previous association with the qualities of material nature. Therefore one seriously eager to achieve transcendental perfection, Kṛṣṇa consciousness, must eat *kṛṣṇa-prasādam.* Such food is *sāttvika,* or in the material quality of goodness, but when offered to Kṛṣṇa it becomes transcendental. Our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement distributes *kṛṣṇa-prasādam,* and those who eat such transcendental food are sure to become devotees of the Lord. This is a very scientific method, as stated in this verse from *Nala-naiṣadha* (3.17): *kāryaṁ nidānād dhi guṇān adhīte.* If in all his activities a person strictly adheres to the mode of goodness, he will certainly develop his dormant Kṛṣṇa consciousness and ultimately become a pure devotee of Lord Kṛṣṇa.

Unfortunately, at the present moment the bodily constitutions of the leaders of society, especially the governmental leaders, are polluted. As described in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (12.1.40):

*asaṁskṛtāḥ kriyā-hīnā* *rajasā tamasāvrtāḥ  
prajās te bhakṣayiṣyanti* *mlecchā rājany-arūpiṇaḥ*

Such leaders have no chance to purify their eating. Politicians meet together and exchange good wishes by drinking liquor, which is so polluted and sinful that naturally drunkards and meat-eaters develop a degraded mentality in the mode of ignorance. The processes of eating in different modes are explained in the *Bhagavad-gītā,* wherein it is stated that those who eat rice, wheat, vegetables, milk products, fruit and sugar are situated in the elevated quality of goodness. Therefore if we want a happy and tranquil political situation, we must select leaders who eat *kṛṣṇa-prasādam.* Otherwise the leaders will eat meat and drink wine, and thus they will be *asaṁskṛtāḥ,* unreformed, and *kriyā-hīnāḥ,* devoid of spiritual behavior. In other words, they will be *mlecchas* and *yavanas,* or men who are unclean in their habits. Through taxation, such men exploit the citizens as much as possible, and in this way they devour the citizens of the state instead of benefiting them. We therefore cannot expect a government to be efficient if it is headed by such unclean *mlecchas* and *yavanas.*

### Translation

**One has to learn about the beauty and transcendental position of the holy name of the Lord by hearing the revealed scriptures from the mouths of devotees. Nowhere else can we hear of the sweetness of the Lord’s holy name.**

### Purport

It is said in the *Padma Purāṇa, ataḥ śrī-kṛṣṇa-nāmādi na bhaved grāhyam indriyaiḥ.* Chanting and hearing of the transcendental holy name of the Lord cannot be performed by the ordinary senses. The transcendental vibration of the Lord’s holy name is completely spiritual. Thus it must be received from spiritual sources and must be chanted after having been heard from a spiritual master. One who hears the chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra* must receive it from the spiritual master by aural reception. Śrīla Sanātana Gosvāmī has forbidden us to hear the holy name of Kṛṣṇa chanted by non-Vaiṣṇavas, such as professional actors and singers, for it will have no effect. It is like milk touched by the lips of a serpent, as stated in the *Padma Purāṇa:*

*avaiṣṇava-mukhodgīrṇaṁ* *pūtaṁ hari-kathāmṛtam  
śravaṇaṁ naiva kartavyaṁ* *sarpocchiṣṭaṁ yathā payaḥ*

As far as possible, therefore, the devotees in the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement gather to chant the holy name of Kṛṣṇa in public so that both the chanters and the listeners may benefit.

*śrī-caitanya-mano-’bhīṣṭaṁ* *sthāpitaṁ yena bhū-tale  
svayaṁ rūpaḥ kadā mahyaṁ* *dadāti sva-padāntikam*

“When will Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī Prabhupāda, who has established within this material world the mission to fulfill the desire of Lord Caitanya, give me shelter under his lotus feet?”

The special function of Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī is to establish the feelings of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. These feelings are His desires that His special mercy be spread throughout the world in this Kali-yuga.

*pṛthivīte āche yata nagarādi-grāma  
sarvatra pracāra haibe mora nāma*

The desire of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is that all over the world everyone, in every village and every town, know of Him and His *saṅkīrtana* movement. These are the inner feelings of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Śrī Rūpa Gosvāmī committed to writing all these feelings of the Lord. Now again, by the mercy of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, the same feelings are being spread all over the world by the servants of the Gosvāmīs, and devotees who are pure and simple will appreciate this attempt. As concluded by Śrīla Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī, however, those who are on the level of hogs and dogs will never appreciate such a great attempt. Yet this does not matter to the preachers of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s cult, for all over the world they will continue to perform this responsible work, even though persons who are like cats and dogs do not appreciate them.

### Translation

**Rāmānanda Rāya inquired, “How have you introduced the assembly of the players?”**

### Purport

**Rūpa Gosvāmī replied, “The players assemble at a suitable time under the heading of pravartaka.**

In a drama all the actors are called *pātra,* or players. This is stated by Viśvanātha Kavirāja in the *Sāhitya-darpaṇa* (6.283):

*divya-martye sa tad-rūpo* *miśram anyataras tayoḥ  
sūcayed vastu-bījaṁ vā-* *mukhaṁ pātram athāpi vā*

The meaning of *āmukha* is stated by Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī in the *Nāṭaka-candrikā:*

*sūtra-dhāro naṭī brūte* *sva-kāryaṁ pratiyuktitaḥ  
prastutākṣepi-citroktyā* *yat tad āmukham īritam*

When Śrīla Rāmānanda Rāya inquired about the arrangement for introducing the assembly of players in the drama, Rūpa Gosvāmī replied that when the players first enter the stage in response to the time, the introduction is technically called *pravartaka.* For an example, see verse 136 below. Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura says that the introduction, which is technically called *āmukha,* may be of five different kinds, according to the *Sāhitya-darpaṇa* (6.288):

*udghātyakaḥ kathodghātaḥ* *prayogātiśayas tathā  
pravartakāvalagite* *pañca prastāvanā-bhidāḥ*

“Introductions may be classified as follows: (1) *udghātyaka,* (2) *kathodghāta,* (3) *prayogātiśaya,* (4) *pravartaka* and (5) *avalagita.*” These five kinds of introduction are called *āmukha.* Thus Śrīla Rāmānanda Rāya asked which of the five introductions had been employed, and Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī replied that he had used the introduction called the *pravartaka.*

### Translation

**“ ‘Springtime had arrived, and the full moon of that season inspired the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is complete in everything, with new attraction to meet the beautiful Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī at night to increase the beauty of Their pastimes.’ ”**

### Purport

Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura interprets this verse (*Vidagdha-mādhava* 1.10) in two ways, for Lord Kṛṣṇa and for Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī. When interpreted for Kṛṣṇa, the night is understood to have been a dark-moon night, and when interpreted for Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī, it is considered to have been a full-moon night.

### Purport

**Śrī Rūpa replied, “I think that Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s desire to hear is prarocanā.**

The method of inducing the audience to become more and more eager to hear by praising the time and place, the hero and the audience is called *prarocanā.* This is the statement regarding *prarocanā* in the *Nāṭaka-candrikā:*

*deśa-kāla-kathā-vastu-* *sabhyādīnāṁ praśaṁsayā  
śrotṝṇām unmukhī-kāraḥ* *kathiteyaṁ prarocanā*

Similarly, the *Sāhitya-darpaṇa* (6.286) says:

*tasyāḥ prarocanā vīthī* *tathā prahasanā-mukhe  
aṅgānyatronmukhī-kāraḥ* *praśaṁsātaḥ prarocanā*

Any literature presented in Sanskrit must follow the rules and regulations mentioned in the authoritative reference books. The technical inquiries by Śrīla Rāmānanda Rāya and the replies of Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī indicate that both of them were expert and fully conversant with the techniques of writing drama.

### Translation

**“This introduction is technically called udghātyaka, and the whole scene is called vīthī. You are so expert in dramatic expression that each of my statements before you is like a wave from an ocean of impudence.**

In this connection Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura again quotes the following verse from the *Sāhitya-darpaṇa* (6.288):

*udghātyakaḥ kathodghātaḥ* *prayogātiśayas tathā

Thus the technical names for the five kinds of introductory scenes of the drama are listed as *udghātyaka, kathodghāta, prayogātiśaya, pravartaka* and *avalagita.* When Śrīla Rāmānanda Rāya inquired which of these five Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī had used to accomplish the technical introduction to his drama *Lalita-mādhava,* Rūpa Gosvāmī replied that he had used the introduction technically called *udghātyaka.* According to the *Bhāratī-vṛtti,* three technical terms used are *prarocanā, vīthī* and *prahasanā.* Thus Rūpa Gosvāmī also mentioned *vīthī,* which is a technical term for a certain type of expression. According to the *Sāhitya-darpaṇa* (6.520):

*vīthyām eko bhaved aṅkaḥ* *kaścid eko ’tra kalpyate  
ākāśa-bhāṣitair uktaiś* *citrāṁ pratyuktim āśritaḥ*

The *vīthī* beginning of a drama consists of only one scene. In that scene, one of the heroes enters the stage, and by means of opposing statements uttered by a voice from the sky (offstage), he introduces the abundant conjugal mellow and other mellows to some degree. In the course of the introduction, all the seeds of the play are planted. This introduction is called *udghātyaka* because the player dances on the stage. This term also indicates that the full moon enters the stage. In this case, when the word *naṭatā* (“dancing on the stage”) is linked with the moon, its meaning is obscure, but because the meaning becomes very clear when the word *naṭatā* is linked with Kṛṣṇa, this type of introduction is called *udghātyaka*.

Śrīla Rāmānanda Rāya used highly technical terms when he discussed this subject with Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī. Rūpa Gosvāmī stated that Śrīla Rāmānanda Rāya was a greatly learned scholar of bona fide dramatic composition. Thus although Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī was quite fit to answer Śrīla Rāmānanda Rāya’s questions, due to his Vaiṣṇava humility he said that his words were impudent. Actually both Rūpa Gosvāmī and Rāmānanda Rāya were scholarly experts in composing poetry and presenting it strictly according to the *Sāhitya-darpaṇa* and other Vedic literatures.

### Translation

**“ ‘The dust from cows and calves on the road creates a kind of darkness indicating that Kṛṣṇa is returning home from the pasture. Also, the darkness of evening provokes the gopīs to meet Kṛṣṇa. Thus the pastimes of Kṛṣṇa and the gopīs are covered by a kind of transcendental darkness and are therefore impossible for ordinary scholars of the Vedas to see.’**

### Purport

This verse from the *Lalita-mādhava* (1.23) is spoken by Paurṇamāsī in a conversation with Gārgī.

Kṛṣṇa states in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (2.45), *trai-guṇya-viṣayā vedā nistrai-guṇyo bhavārjuna.* Thus He advised Arjuna to rise above the modes of material nature, for the entire Vedic system is filled with descriptions involving *sattva-guṇa, rajo-guṇa* and *tamo-guṇa.* People are generally covered by the quality of *rajo-guṇa* and are therefore unable to understand the pastimes of Kṛṣṇa with the *gopīs* of Vraja. Moreover, the quality of *tamo-guṇa* further disturbs their understanding. In Vṛndāvana, however, although Kṛṣṇa is covered by the hazy darkness of the dust, the *gopīs* can nevertheless understand that within the dust storm is Kṛṣṇa. Because they are His topmost devotees, they can perceive His hand in everything. Thus even in the dark or in a hazy storm of dust, devotees can understand what Kṛṣṇa is doing. The purport of this verse is that under no circumstances is Kṛṣṇa ever lost to the vision of exalted devotees like the *gopīs.*

The Supreme Personality of Godhead is not partial to some and neutral to others. One can actually draw the attention of the Supreme Personality of Godhead by service. Then one is further empowered by the Lord to act in such a way that everyone can appreciate his service. This is confirmed in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (4.11): *ye yathā māṁ prapadyante tāṁs tathaiva bhajāmy aham.* Kṛṣṇa is responsive. If one tries to render his best service to the Lord, the Lord gives him the power to do so. Kṛṣṇa also says in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (10.10):

*teṣāṁ satata-yuktānāṁ* *bhajatāṁ prīti-pūrvakam  
dadāmi buddhi-yogaṁ taṁ* *yena mām upayānti te*

“To those who are constantly devoted to serving Me with love, I give the understanding by which they can come to Me.” Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu bestowed His special favor upon Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī because Rūpa Gosvāmī wanted to serve the Lord to the best of his ability. Such is the reciprocation between the devotee and the Lord in the discharge of devotional duties.

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu informed Śrīla Rāmānanda Rāya that he and Sanātana Gosvāmī had engaged equally in devotional service after giving up all relationships with material activity. Such renunciation is a symptom of an unalloyed devotee engaged in the service of the Lord with no tinge of material contamination. According to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, this is the position of *tṛṇād api su-nīcena taror iva sahiṣṇunā.* A pure devotee, free from the reactions of the material modes of nature, executes devotional service with tolerance like that of a tree. He also feels humbler than the grass. Such a devotee, who is called *niṣkiñcana,* or free from all material possessions, is always absorbed in emotional love of Godhead. He is reluctant to perform any kind of sense gratification. In other words, such a devotee is free from all material bondage, but he engages in Kṛṣṇa conscious activities. Such expert devotional service is performed without hypocrisy. Humility, renunciation and learned scholarship were combined in Sanātana Gosvāmī, the ideal pure devotee, who was on the same level of understanding as Śrīla Rāmānanda Rāya. Like Rāmānanda Rāya, Sanātana Gosvāmī was a fully cognizant expert in the conclusions of devotional service and was therefore able to describe such transcendental knowledge.

Because he is empowered by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, whatever he writes becomes very effective. The principle of being empowered by the Supreme Personality of Godhead is essential. A materialistic poet who describes in his poetry the material activities of men and women cannot describe the transcendental pastimes of the Lord or the transcendental conclusions of devotional service. Śrīla Sanātana Gosvāmī has therefore warned all neophyte devotees that one should not hear from the mouth of a non-Vaiṣṇava:

*avaiṣṇava-mukhodgīrṇaṁ* *pūtaṁ hari-kathāmṛtam  
śravaṇaṁ naiva kartavyaṁ* *sarpocchiṣṭaṁ yathā payaḥ*

(*Padma Purāṇa*)

“One should not hear anything about Kṛṣṇa from a non-Vaiṣṇava. Milk touched by the lips of a serpent has poisonous effects; similarly, talks about Kṛṣṇa given by a non-Vaiṣṇava are also poisonous.”

Unless one is a fully unalloyed devotee of the Lord, one should not try to describe the pastimes of Kṛṣṇa in poetry, for it will be only mundane. There are many descriptions of Kṛṣṇa’s *Bhagavad-gītā* written by persons whose consciousness is mundane and who are not qualified by pure devotion. Although they attempted to write transcendental literature, they could not fully engage even a single devotee in Kṛṣṇa’s service. Such literature is mundane, and therefore, as warned by Śrī Sanātana Gosvāmī, one should not touch it.
