CHAPTER SEVEN

The following summary of chapter seven is given by Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura in his *Amṛta-pravāha-bhāṣya.* In this chapter, Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s meeting with Vallabha Bhaṭṭa is described. There was some joking behavior between these two personalities, and finally Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu corrected Vallabha Bhaṭṭa and sympathetically accepted an invitation from him. Before this, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu saw that Vallabha Bhaṭṭa was greatly attached to Gadādhara Paṇḍita. Therefore He acted as if displeased with Gadādhara Paṇḍita. Later, when Vallabha Bhaṭṭa became intimately connected with the Lord, the Lord advised him to take instructions from Gadādhara Paṇḍita. Thus the Lord expressed His feelings of love for Gadādhara Paṇḍita.

### Purport

Śrī Madhvācārya has brought our attention to this quotation from the *Nārāyaṇa-saṁhitā:*

*dvāparīyair janair viṣṇuḥ* *pañcarātrais tu kevalaiḥ  
kalau tu nāma-mātreṇa* *pūjyate bhagavān hariḥ*

“In the Dvāpara-yuga one could satisfy Kṛṣṇa or Viṣṇu only by worshiping opulently according to the *pāñcarātrikī* system, but in the Age of Kali one can satisfy and worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead Hari simply by chanting His holy name.” Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura explains that unless one is directly empowered by the causeless mercy of Kṛṣṇa, one cannot become the spiritual master of the entire world (*jagad-guru*)*.* One cannot become an *ācārya* simply by mental speculation. The true *ācārya* presents Kṛṣṇa to everyone by preaching the holy name of the Lord throughout the world. Thus the conditioned souls, purified by chanting the holy name, are liberated from the blazing fire of material existence. In this way, spiritual benefit grows increasingly full, like the waxing moon in the sky. The true *ācārya,* the spiritual master of the entire world, must be considered an incarnation of Kṛṣṇa’s mercy. Indeed, he is personally embracing Kṛṣṇa. He is therefore the spiritual master of all the *varṇas* (*brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya* and *śūdra*) and all the *āśramas* (*brahmacarya, gṛhastha, vānaprastha* and *sannyāsa*). Since he is understood to be the most advanced devotee, he is called *paramahaṁsa-ṭhākura. Ṭhākura* is a title of honor offered to the *paramahaṁsa.* Therefore one who acts as an *ācārya,* directly presenting Lord Kṛṣṇa by spreading His name and fame, is also to be called *paramahaṁsa-ṭhākura.*

### Purport

*Puruṣārtha* (“the goal of life”) generally refers to religion, economic development, satisfaction of the senses and, finally, liberation. However, above these four kinds of *puruṣārthas,* love of Godhead stands supreme. It is called *parama-puruṣārtha* (the supreme goal of life) or *puruṣārtha-śiromaṇi* (the most exalted of all *puruṣārthas*). Lord Kṛṣṇa is worshiped by regulative devotional service, but the highest perfection of devotional service is spontaneous love of Godhead.

Nor was such a thing ever imagined by the most beautiful girls in the heavenly planets, girls whose bodily luster and aroma resemble the beauty and fragrance of lotus flowers. And what to speak of worldly women, who may be very, very beautiful according to material estimation?’**

This verse from *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (10.47.61) was spoken by Uddhava. When Uddhava was sent by Kṛṣṇa to see the condition of the *gopīs* in Vṛndāvana, he stayed there for a few months in their association and always talked with them about Kṛṣṇa. Although this greatly pleased the *gopīs* and other residents of Vrajabhūmi, Vṛndāvana, Uddhava saw that the *gopīs* were severely afflicted by their separation from Kṛṣṇa. Their hearts were so disturbed that their minds were sometimes deranged. Observing the unalloyed devotion and love of the *gopīs* for Kṛṣṇa, Uddhava desired to become a creeper, a blade of grass or an herb in Vṛndāvana so that sometimes the *gopīs* would trample him and he would receive the dust of their lotus feet on his head.

**Knowing that Vallabha Bhaṭṭa’s heart was full of pride, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu spoke these words, hinting at how one can learn about devotional service.**

### Purport

Vallabha Bhaṭṭa was greatly proud of his knowledge in devotional service, and therefore he wanted to speak about Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu without understanding the Lord’s position. The Lord therefore hinted in many ways that if Vallabha Bhaṭṭa wanted to know what devotional service actually is, he would have to learn from all the devotees He mentioned, beginning with Advaita Ācārya, Lord Nityānanda, Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya and Rāmānanda Rāya. As Svarūpa Dāmodara has said, if one wants to learn the meaning of *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,* one must take lessons from a realized soul. One should not proudly think that one can understand the transcendental loving service of the Lord simply by reading books. One must become a servant of a Vaiṣṇava. As Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura has confirmed, *chāḍiyā vaiṣṇava-sevā nistāra peyeche kebā:* one cannot be in a transcendental position unless one very faithfully serves a pure Vaiṣṇava. One must accept a Vaiṣṇava *guru* (*ādau gurv-āśrayam*), and then by questions and answers one should gradually learn what pure devotional service to Kṛṣṇa is. That is called the *paramparā* system.

As the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu exists in everyone’s heart. Therefore He would know the circumstances under which Paṇḍita Gosāñi agreed to hear Vallabha Bhaṭṭa’s explanations, and certainly He would not be angry. However, the Vaiṣṇavas who were always with Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu might not understand Gadādhara Paṇḍita’s inner consciousness, and they might accuse him of having compromised with Vallabha Bhaṭṭa, despite his having been neglected by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Gadādhara Paṇḍita Gosāñi was seriously thinking in this way.

### Translation

**“Whatever you might write due to false pride, trying to surpass Śrīdhara Svāmī, would carry a contrary purport. Therefore no one would pay attention to it.**

### Purport

*Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* has many *ṭīkās,* or commentaries, following the *paramparā* system, but Śrīdhara Svāmī’s is first. The commentaries of all the other *ācāryas* follow his. The *paramparā* system does not allow one to deviate from the commentaries of the previous *ācāryas.* By depending upon the previous *ācāryas,* one can write beautiful commentaries. However, one cannot defy the previous *ācāryas.* The false pride that makes one think that he can write better than the previous *ācāryas* will make one’s comments faulty. At the present moment it has become fashionable for everyone to write in his own way, but such writing is never accepted by serious devotees. Because of false pride, every scholar and philosopher wants to exhibit his learning by interpreting the *śāstras,* especially the *Bhagavad-gītā* and *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,* in his own way. This system of commenting in one’s own way is fully condemned by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Therefore He says, *‘artha-vyasta’ likhana sei.* commentaries written according to one’s own philosophical way are never accepted; no one will appreciate such commentaries on the revealed scriptures.

Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura comments that Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu acted as a very merciful well-wisher toward Vallabha Bhaṭṭa by externally neglecting him in many ways to purify him of his false pride in being a learned scholar. The Lord neglected Gadādhara Paṇḍita for a few days because of his associating with Vallabha Bhaṭṭa. Actually He was not at all displeased with Gadādhara Paṇḍita. Indeed, because Gadādhara Paṇḍita is the personal potency of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, there is no chance of the Lord’s being dissatisfied with him. However, a person who is too much attracted to externals cannot understand the deep meaning of these dealings of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. If one therefore becomes disrespectful to Gadādhara Paṇḍita, he will surely be vanquished.
