CHAPTER EIGHTEEN

A summary of the eighteenth chapter is given by Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura in his *Amṛta-pravāha-bhāṣya.* On an autumn evening when the moon was full, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu walked along the seashore near the Āiṭoṭā temple. Mistaking the sea for the Yamunā River, He jumped into it, hoping to see the water pastimes Kṛṣṇa enjoyed with Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī and the other *gopīs.* As He floated in the sea, however, He was washed away to the Koṇārka temple, where a fisherman, thinking that the Lord’s body was a big fish, caught Him in his net and brought Him ashore. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was unconscious, and His body had become unusually transformed. As soon as the fisherman touched the Lord’s body, he became mad in ecstatic love of Kṛṣṇa. His own madness frightened him, however, because he thought that he was being haunted by a ghost. As he was about to seek a ghost charmer, he met Svarūpa Dāmodara Gosvāmī and the other devotees on the beach, who had been looking everywhere for the Lord. After some inquiries, Svarūpa Dāmodara could understand that the fisherman had caught Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu in his net. Since the fisherman was afraid of being haunted by a ghost, Svarūpa Dāmodara gave him a slap and chanted Hare Kṛṣṇa, which immediately pacified him. Thereafter, when the devotees chanted the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra* loudly, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu came to His external consciousness. Then they brought Him back to His own residence.

### Translation

**“The blue lotuses are friends of the sun-god, and though they all live together, the blue lotuses plunder the cakravākas. The red lotuses, however, blossom at night and are therefore strangers or enemies to the cakravākas. Yet in Kṛṣṇa’s pastimes the red lotuses, which are the hands of the gopīs, protect their cakravāka breasts. This is a metaphor of contradiction.”**

### Purport

Because the blue lotus flower blossoms with the rising of the sun, the sun is the friend of the blue lotus. The *cakravāka* birds also appear when the sun rises, and therefore the *cakravākas* and blue lotuses meet. Although the blue lotus is a friend of the sun, in Kṛṣṇa’s pastimes it nevertheless plunders their mutual friend the *cakravāka.* Normally, *cakravākas* move about whereas lotuses stand still, but herein Kṛṣṇa’s hands, which are compared to blue lotuses, attack the breasts of the *gopīs,* which are compared to *cakravākas.* This is called a reverse analogy. At night the red lotus blossoms, whereas in sunlight it closes. Therefore the red lotus is an enemy of the sun and is unknown to the sun’s friend the *cakravāka.* The *gopīs’* breasts, however, are compared to *cakravākas* and their hands to red lotuses protecting them. This is a wonderful instance of reverse analogy.
