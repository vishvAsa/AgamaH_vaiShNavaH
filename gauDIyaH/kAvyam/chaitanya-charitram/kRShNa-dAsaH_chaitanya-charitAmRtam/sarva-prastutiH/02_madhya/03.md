CHAPTER THREE

In his *Amṛta-pravāha-bhāṣya,* Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura gives the following summary of the third chapter. After accepting the *sannyāsa* order at Katwa, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu traveled continuously for three days in Rāḍha-deśa and, by the trick of Nityānanda Prabhu, eventually came to the western side of Śāntipura. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was induced to believe that the river Ganges was the Yamunā. When He was worshiping the sacred river, Advaita Prabhu arrived in a boat. Advaita Prabhu asked Him to take His bath in the Ganges and took Him to His (Advaita’s) house. There all the Navadvīpa devotees, along with mother Śacīdevī, came to see Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. This house was located at Śāntipura. Mother Śacīdevī cooked for Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and Nityānanda Prabhu, and at that time there were many joking exchanges between Advaita Prabhu and Nityānanda Prabhu. In the evening there was a mass *saṅkīrtana* at the house of Advaita Prabhu, and mother Śacīdevī gave Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu permission to leave. She requested Him to make Jagannātha Purī, Nīlācala, His headquarters. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu granted His mother’s request and, followed by Nityānanda, Mukunda, Jagadānanda and Dāmodara, left Śāntipura. Bidding farewell to mother Śacīdevī, they all proceeded toward Jagannātha Purī, following the path of Chatrabhoga.

### Translation

**After accepting the sannyāsa order, Caitanya Mahāprabhu, out of intense love for Kṛṣṇa, started for Vṛndāvana. However, He mistakenly wandered about in a trance continuously for three days in the tract of land known as Rāḍha-deśa.**

### Purport

The word Rāḍha-deśa comes from the word *rāṣṭra,* or “state.” From *rāṣṭra* the corrupted word *rāḍha* has come. The part of Bengal on the western side of the Ganges is known as Rāḍha-deśa. Another name is Pauṇḍra-deśa or Peṇḍo-deśa. The word *peṇḍo* is a corrupted form of the word *pauṇḍra.* It appears that the capital of Rāṣṭra-deśa was situated in that part of Bengal.

### Translation

**“\[As a brāhmaṇa from Avantī-deśa said:\] ‘I shall cross over the insurmountable ocean of nescience by being firmly fixed in the service of the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa. This was approved by the previous ācāryas, who were fixed in firm devotion to the Lord, Paramātmā, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.’ ”**

### Purport

In connection with this verse, which is a quotation from *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (11.23.57), Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura says that of the sixty-four items required for rendering devotional service, acceptance of the symbolic marks of *sannyāsa* is a regulative principle. If one accepts the *sannyāsa* order, his main business is to devote his life completely to the service of Mukunda, Kṛṣṇa. If one does not completely devote his mind and body to the service of the Lord, he does not actually become a *sannyāsī.* It is not simply a matter of changing dress. In *Bhagavad-gītā* (6.1) it is also stated, *anāśritaḥ karma-phalaṁ kāryaṁ karma karoti yaḥ/ sa sannyāsī ca yogī ca:* one who works devotedly for the satisfaction of Kṛṣṇa is a *sannyāsī.* The dress is not *sannyāsa,* but the attitude of service to Kṛṣṇa is.

The word *parātma-niṣṭhā* means being a devotee of Lord Kṛṣṇa. *Parātmā,* the Supreme Person, is Kṛṣṇa. *Īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ.* Those who are completely dedicated to the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa in service are actually *sannyāsīs.* As a matter of formality, the devotee accepts the *sannyāsa* dress as previous *ācāryas* did. He also accepts the three *daṇḍas.* Later Viṣṇu Svāmī considered that accepting the dress of a *tri-daṇḍī* was *parātma-niṣṭhā.* Therefore sincere devotees add another *daṇḍa,* the *jīva-daṇḍa,* to the three existing *daṇḍas.* The Vaiṣṇava *sannyāsī* is known as a *tridaṇḍi-sannyāsī.* The Māyāvādī *sannyāsī* accepts only one *daṇḍa,* not understanding the meaning of *tri-daṇḍa.* Later, many persons in the community of Śiva Svāmī gave up the *ātma-niṣṭhā* (devotional service) of the Lord and followed the path of Śaṅkarācārya. Instead of accepting 108 names, those in the Śiva Svāmī *sampradāya* follow the path of Śaṅkarācārya and accept the ten names of *sannyāsa.* Although Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu accepted the then-existing order of *sannyāsa* (namely *eka-daṇḍa*), He still recited a verse from *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* about the *tridaṇḍa-sannyāsa* accepted by the *brāhmaṇa* of Avantīpura. Indirectly He declared that within that *eka-daṇḍa,* one *daṇḍa,* four *daṇḍas* existed as one. Accepting *ekadaṇḍa-sannyāsa* without *parātma-niṣṭhā* (devotional service to Lord Kṛṣṇa) is not acceptable to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. In addition, according to the exact regulative principles, one should add the *jīva-daṇḍa* to the *tri-daṇḍa.* These four *daṇḍas,* bound together as one, are symbolic of unalloyed devotional service to the Lord. Because the *ekadaṇḍi-sannyāsīs* of the Māyāvāda school are not devoted to the service of Kṛṣṇa, they try to merge into the Brahman effulgence, which is a marginal position between material and spiritual existence. They accept this impersonal position as liberation. Māyāvādī *sannyāsīs,* not knowing that Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was a *tridaṇḍī,* think of Caitanya Mahāprabhu as an *ekadaṇḍi-sannyāsī.* This is due to their *vivarta,* bewilderment. In *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* there is no such thing as an *ekadaṇḍi-sannyāsī;* indeed, the *tridaṇḍi-sannyāsī* is accepted as the symbolic representation of the *sannyāsa* order. By citing this verse from *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,* Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu accepted the *sannyāsa* order recommended in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.* The Māyāvādī *sannyāsīs,* who are enamored of the external energy of the Lord, cannot understand the mind of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

To date, all the devotees of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, following in His footsteps, accept the *sannyāsa* order and keep the sacred thread and tuft of unshaved hair. The *ekadaṇḍi-sannyāsīs* of the Māyāvādī school give up the sacred thread and do not keep any tuft of hair. Therefore they are unable to understand the purport of *tridaṇḍa-sannyāsa,* and as such they are not inclined to dedicate their lives to the service of Mukunda. They simply think of merging into the existence of Brahman because of their disgust with material existence. The *ācāryas* who advocate the *daiva-varṇāśrama* (the social order of *cātur-varṇyam* mentioned in the *Bhagavad-gītā*) do not accept the proposition of *āsura-varṇāśrama,* which maintains that the social order of *varṇa* is indicated by birth.

The most intimate devotee of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, namely Gadādhara Paṇḍita, accepted *tridaṇḍa-sannyāsa* and also accepted Mādhava Upādhyāya as his *tridaṇḍi-sannyāsī* disciple. It is said that from this Mādhavācārya the *sampradāya* known in western India as the Vallabhācārya *sampradāya* has begun. Śrīla Gopāla Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmī, who is known as a *smṛty-ācārya* in the Gauḍīya-Vaiṣṇava-sampradāya, later accepted the *tridaṇḍa-sannyāsa* order from Tridaṇḍipāda Prabodhānanda Sarasvatī. Although acceptance of *tridaṇḍa-sannyāsa* is not distinctly mentioned in the Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava literature, the first verse of Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī’s *Upadeśāmṛta* advocates that one should accept the *tridaṇḍa-sannyāsa* order by controlling the six forces:

*vāco vegaṁ manasaḥ krodha-vegaṁ *
 *jihvā-vegam udaropastha-vegam  
etān vegān yo viṣaheta dhīraḥ *
 *sarvām apīmāṁ pṛthivīṁ sa śiṣyāt*

“One who can control the forces of speech, mind, anger, belly, tongue and genitals is known as a *gosvāmī* and is competent to accept disciples all over the world.” The followers of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu never accepted the Māyāvāda order of *sannyāsa,* and for this they cannot be blamed. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu accepted Śrīdhara Svāmī, who was a *tridaṇḍi-sannyāsī,* but the Māyāvādī *sannyāsīs,* not understanding Śrīdhara Svāmī, sometimes think that Śrīdhara Svāmī belonged to the Māyāvāda *ekadaṇḍa-sannyāsa* community. Actually this was not the case.

### Translation

**The real purpose of accepting sannyāsa is to dedicate oneself to the service of Mukunda. By serving Mukunda, one can actually be liberated from the bondage of material existence.**

### Purport

In this connection, Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura says that Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu accepted the *sannyāsa* order and recommended the determination of the Avantīpura *bhikṣu* to engage in the service of Mukunda. He accepted the *brāhmaṇa’s* version due to his determination to serve Mukunda. The *sannyāsī* dress is actually an attraction for material formality. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu did not like such formality, but He wanted the essence of it — service to Mukunda. Such determination in any condition is *parātma-niṣṭhā.* That is required. The conclusion is that the *sannyāsa* order depends not on the dress but the determination to serve Mukunda.

### Translation

**All the eatables were first cooked by the wife of Advaita Ācārya. Then Śrīla Advaita Ācārya personally offered everything to Lord Viṣṇu.**

### Purport

This is the ideal householder’s life. The husband and wife live together, and the husband works very hard to secure paraphernalia for worshiping Lord Viṣṇu. The wife at home cooks a variety of foods for Lord Viṣṇu, and the husband offers it to the Deity. After that, *ārati* is performed, and the *prasādam* is distributed amongst family members and guests. According to the Vedic principles, there must always be a guest in a householder’s house. In my childhood I have actually seen my father receive not less than four guests every day, and in those days my father’s income was not very great. Nonetheless, there was no difficulty in offering *prasādam* to at least four guests every day. According to Vedic principles, a householder, before taking lunch, should go outside and shout very loudly to see if there is anyone without food. In this way he invites people to take *prasādam.* If someone comes, the householder offers him *prasādam,* and if there is not much left, he should offer his own portion to the guest. If no one responds to his call, the householder can accept his own lunch. Thus the householder’s life is also a kind of austerity. Because of this, the householder’s life is called the *gṛhastha-āśrama.* Although a person may live with his wife and children happily in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he also observes the regulative principles followed in any temple. If there is no Kṛṣṇa consciousness, the householder’s abode is called a *gṛha-medhī’s* house. Householders in Kṛṣṇa consciousness are actually *gṛhasthas* — that is, those living in the *āśrama* with their families and children. Śrī Advaita Prabhu was an ideal *gṛhastha,* and His house was the ideal *gṛhastha-āśrama.*

### Translation

**All the prepared food was divided into three equal parts. One part was arranged on a metal plate for offering to Lord Kṛṣṇa.**

### Purport

The word *bāḍāila,* meaning “increased,” is very significant in this verse. It is a sophisticated word used by the *gṛhasthas* in Bengal. Whenever food is prepared and we take away a portion, the food is actually decreased. But here it is the system to say *bāḍāila,* or “increased.” If food is prepared for Kṛṣṇa and offered to Him and the Vaiṣṇavas, the stock is increased, never decreased.

### Purport

Although the Hindus and Muslims lived together in a very friendly manner, still there were distinctions between them. The Muslims were considered *yavanas,* or low-born, and whenever a Muslim was invited, he would be fed outside of the house. Although personally called by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and Nityānanda Prabhu to take *prasādam* with Them, still, out of great humility, Haridāsa Ṭhākura submitted, “I shall take the *prasādam* outside of the house.” Although Haridāsa Ṭhākura was an exalted Vaiṣṇava accepted by Advaita Ācārya, Nityānanda Prabhu and Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, nonetheless, in order not to disturb social tranquillity, he humbly kept himself in the position of a Muslim, outside the jurisdiction of the Hindu community. Therefore he proposed to take *prasādam* outside the house. Although he was in an exalted position and equal to other great Vaiṣṇavas, he considered himself a *pāpiṣṭha,* a most sinful man, and *adhama,* the lowest among men. Although a Vaiṣṇava may be very advanced spiritually, he keeps himself externally humble and submissive.

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was pleased because He saw how nicely so many varieties of food were prepared for Kṛṣṇa. Actually all kinds of *prasādam* are prepared for Kṛṣṇa, not for the people, but the devotees partake of *prasādam* with great pleasure.

### Translation

**When Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu entered the room, He saw three divisions of food, and He knew that all of these were meant for Kṛṣṇa. However, He did not understand the intentions of Advaita Ācārya.**

### Purport

Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura states that one of these servings was offered in a metal dish and was meant for Kṛṣṇa, whereas the other two were placed on big banana leaves. The offering on the metal plate was personally offered by Advaita Ācārya to Kṛṣṇa. The other two servings, on banana leaves, were to be accepted by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and Lord Nityānanda. That was Advaita Ācārya’s intention, but He did not disclose this to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Thus when Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu saw the food offered in three places, He thought that all of it was meant for Kṛṣṇa.

### Synonyms

*prabhu* *kahe* — the Lord said; *sannyāsīra* — by a *sannyāsī*; *bhakṣya* — to be eaten; *nahe* — this is not; *upakaraṇa* — varieties of food; *ihā* — this; *khāile* — if eating; *kaiche* — how; *haya* — there is; *indriya* — senses; *vāraṇa* — controlling.

### Translation

**Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, “It is not proper for a sannyāsī to eat such a variety of foods. If he does, how can he control his senses?”**

### Purport

The word *upakaraṇa* indicates a variety of foods, such as dhal, vegetables and other varieties of possible dishes that one can eat very nicely with rice. It is not proper, however, for a *sannyāsī* to eat such palatable dishes. If he did so, he would not be able to control his senses. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu did not encourage *sannyāsīs* to eat very palatable dishes, for the whole Vaiṣṇava cult is *vairāgya-vidyā,* as renounced as possible. Caitanya Mahāprabhu also advised Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī not to eat very palatable dishes, wear very nice garments or talk on mundane subjects. These things are all prohibited for those in the renounced order. A devotee does not accept anything to eat that is not first offered to Kṛṣṇa. All the rich foods offered to Kṛṣṇa are given to the *gṛhasthas,* the householders. There are many nice things offered to Kṛṣṇa — garlands, bedsteads, nice ornaments, nice food and even nicely prepared pan, betel nuts — but a humble Vaiṣṇava, thinking his body material and nasty, does not accept such preparations for himself. He thinks that by accepting such things he will offend the lotus feet of the Lord. Those who are *sahajiyās* cannot understand what Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu meant when He asked Advaita Ācārya to bring two separate leaves and give a small quantity of the *prasādam* to Him.

“Whatever edibles a *sannyāsī* gets from a householder’s house he should take outside near some lake or river, and after offering the food to Viṣṇu, Brahmā and the sun (three divisions), he should eat the entire offering and not leave anything for others to eat.”

### Translation

**Advaita Ācārya said, “You are a reject paramahaṁsa, and You have accepted the renounced order of life just to fill up Your belly. I can understand that Your business is to give trouble to brāhmaṇas.”**

### Purport

There is always a difference of opinion between a *smārta-brāhmaṇa* and a Vaiṣṇava *gosvāmī.* There are even *smārta* opinions and Vaiṣṇava *gosvāmī* opinions available in astrological and astronomical calculations. By calling Nityānanda Prabhu a *bhraṣṭa avadhūta* (a rejected *paramahaṁsa*), Advaita Ācārya Prabhu in a sense accepted Nityānanda Prabhu as a *paramahaṁsa.* In other words, Nityānanda Prabhu had nothing to do with the rules governing *smārta-brāhmaṇas.* Thus under pretense of condemning Him, Advaita Ācārya was actually praising Him. In the *avadhūta* stage, the *paramahaṁsa* stage, which is the supermost stage, one may appear to be *viṣayī,* on the platform of sense gratification, but in actuality he has nothing to do with sense gratification. At that stage, a person sometimes accepts the symbols and dress of a *sannyāsī* and sometimes does not. Sometimes he dresses like a householder. We should know, however, that these are all joking words between Advaita Ācārya and Nityānanda Prabhu. They are not to be taken as insults.

In Khaḍadaha, sometimes people misunderstood Nityānanda Prabhu to belong to the *śākta-sampradāya,* whose philosophy is *antaḥ śāktaḥ bahiḥ śaivaḥ sabhāyāṁ vaiṣṇavo mataḥ.* According to the *śākta-sampradāya,* a person called *kaulāvadhūta* thinks materially while externally appearing to be a great devotee of Lord Śiva. When such a person is in an assembly of Vaiṣṇavas, he appears like a Vaiṣṇava. Actually Nityānanda Prabhu did not belong to such a community. Nityānanda Prabhu was always a *brahmacārī* of a *sannyāsī* of the *vaidika* order. Actually He was a *paramahaṁsa.* Sometimes He is accepted to be a disciple of Lakṣmīpati Tīrtha. If He is so accepted, Nityānanda Prabhu belonged to the Madhva-sampradāya. He did not belong to the *tāntrika-sampradāya* of Bengal.

### Synonyms

*avadhūtera* *jhuṭhā* — the remnants of the food of the *avadhūta*; *lāgila* — touched; *mora* — My; *aṅge* — on the body; *parama* *pavitra* — perfectly purified; *more* — Me; *kaila* — made; *ei* — this; *ḍhaṅge* — behavior.

### Translation

**When the rice thrown by Nityānanda Prabhu touched His body, Advaita Ācārya thought Himself purified by the touch of remnants thrown by Paramahaṁsa Nityānanda. Therefore He began dancing.**

### Purport

The word *avadhūta* refers to one above all rules and regulations. Sometimes, not observing all the rules and regulations of a *sannyāsī,* Nityānanda Prabhu exhibited the behavior of a mad *avadhūta.* He threw the remnants of food on the ground, and some of these remnants touched the body of Advaita Ācārya. Advaita Ācārya accepted this happily because He presented Himself as a member of the community of *smārta-brāhmaṇas.* By touching the remnants of food thrown by Nityānanda Prabhu, Advaita Ācārya immediately felt Himself purified of all *smārta* contamination. The remnants of food left by a pure Vaiṣṇava are called *mahā-mahā-prasādam.* This is completely spiritual and is identified with Lord Viṣṇu. Such remnants are not ordinary. The spiritual master is to be considered on the stage of *paramahaṁsa* and beyond the jurisdiction of the *varṇāśrama* institution. The remnants of food left by the spiritual master and similar *paramahaṁsas,* or pure Vaiṣṇavas, are purifying. When an ordinary person touches such *prasādam,* his mind is purified, and his mind is raised to the status of a pure *brāhmaṇa.* The behavior and statements of Advaita Ācārya are meant for the understanding of ordinary people who are unaware of the strength of spiritual values, not knowing the potency of food left by the bona fide spiritual master and pure Vaiṣṇavas.

### Synonyms

*tore* — You; *nimantraṇa* — invitation; *kari’* — making; *pāinu* — I have gotten in return; *tāra* — of that; *phala* — the result; *tora* — Your; *jāti*-*kula* *nāhi* — there is no indication of Your caste and family; *sahaje* — by nature; *pāgala* — You are a madman.

### Translation

**Advaita Ācārya jokingly said, “My dear Nityānanda, I invited You, and indeed I have received the results. You have no fixed caste or dynasty. By nature You are a madman.**

### Purport

The words *sahaje pāgala* (“by nature a madman”) indicate that Nityānanda Prabhu was transcendentally situated on the *paramahaṁsa* stage. Because He always remembered Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa and Their service, this was transcendental madness. Śrī Advaita Ācārya was pointing out this fact.

*āpanāra sama more karibāra tare  
jhuṭhā dile, vipra bali’ bhaya nā karile*

### Synonyms

*āpanāra* *sama* — like You; *more* — Me; *karibāra* *tare* — for making; *jhuṭhā* — remnants of food; *dile* — You have given; *vipra* *bali’* — considering as a *brāhmaṇa*; *bhaya* — fear; *nā* *karile* — You did not do.

### Translation

**“To make Me a madman like Yourself, You have thrown the remnants of Your food at Me. You did not even fear the fact that I am a brāhmaṇa.”**

### Purport

The words *āpanāra sama* indicate that Advaita Ācārya considered Himself to belong to the *smārta-brāhmaṇas,* and He considered Nityānanda Prabhu to be on the transcendental stage with pure Vaiṣṇavas. Lord Nityānanda gave Advaita Ācārya His remnants to situate Him on the same platform and make Him a pure unalloyed Vaiṣṇava or *paramahaṁsa.* Advaita Ācārya’s statement indicates that a *paramahaṁsa* Vaiṣṇava is transcendentally situated. A pure Vaiṣṇava is not subject to the rules and regulations of the *smārta-brāhmaṇas.* That was the reason for Advaita Ācārya’s stating, *āpanāra sama more karibāra tare:* “to raise Me to Your own standard.” A pure Vaiṣṇava, or a person on the *paramahaṁsa* stage, accepts the remnants of food (*mahā-prasādam*) as spiritual. He does not consider it to be material or sense gratificatory. He accepts *mahā-prasādam* not as ordinary dhal and rice but as spiritual substance. To say nothing of the remnants of food left by a pure Vaiṣṇava, *prasādam* is never polluted even if it is touched by the mouth of a *caṇḍāla.* Indeed, it retains its spiritual value. Therefore by eating or touching such *mahā-prasādam,* a *brāhmaṇa* is not degraded. There is no question of being polluted by touching the remnants of such food. Actually, by eating such *mahā-prasādam,* one is freed from all the contaminations of the material condition. That is the verdict of the *śāstra.*

ihāke ‘jhuṭhā’ kahile, tumi kaile aparādha*

### Synonyms

*nityānanda* *bale* — Lord Nityānanda said; *ei* — this; *kṛṣṇera* *prasāda* — *mahā-prasādam* of Lord Kṛṣṇa; *ihāke* — unto it; *jhuṭhā* — remnants of food; *kahile* — if You say; *tumi* — You; *kaile* — have made; *aparādha* — offense.

### Translation

**Nityānanda Prabhu replied, “These are the remnants of food left by Lord Kṛṣṇa. If You take them to be ordinary remnants, You have committed an offense.”**

### Purport

In the *Bṛhad-viṣṇu Purāṇa* it is stated that one who considers *mahā-prasādam* to be equal to ordinary rice and dhal certainly commits a great offense. Ordinary edibles are touchable and untouchable, but there are no such dualistic considerations where *prasādam* is concerned. *Prasādam* is transcendental, and there are no transformations or contaminations, just as there are no contaminations or transformations in the body of Lord Viṣṇu Himself. Thus even if one is a *brāhmaṇa* he is certain to be attacked by leprosy and bereft of all family members if he makes such dualistic considerations. Such an offender goes to hell, never to return. This is the injunction of the *Bṛhad-viṣṇu Purāṇa.*

### Purport

This is a song composed by Vidyāpati. Sometimes the word *mādhava* is misunderstood to refer to Mādhavendra Purī. Advaita Ācārya was a disciple of Mādhavendra Purī, and consequently some people think that He was referring to Mādhavendra Purī by using the word *mādhava.* But actually this is not the fact. This song was composed to commemorate the separation of Kṛṣṇa from Rādhārāṇī during Kṛṣṇa’s absence in Mathurā. It is thought that this song was sung by Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī when Kṛṣṇa returned. It is technically called *Mathurā-viraha.*

The mouth becomes swollen, and one experiences inertia and illusion. When a person attains his desired object and feels very fortunate, the luster of his body increases. Because of his own qualities and feelings of greatness, he does not care for anyone else, and this is called *garva,* or pride. In this condition one utters prayers and does not reply to others’ inquiries. Looking at one’s own body, concealing one’s desires and not heeding the words of others are symptoms visible in the ecstasy of *garva.*

### Translation

### Purport

These verses indicate that mother Śacī, born in the family of Nīlāmbara Cakravartī, used to worship Lord Viṣṇu even before her marriage. As stated in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (6.41):

*prāpya puṇya-kṛtāṁ lokān* *uṣitvā śāśvatīḥ samāḥ  
śucīnāṁ śrīmatāṁ gehe* *yoga-bhraṣṭo ’bhijāyate*

“The unsuccessful *yogī,* after many, many years of enjoyment on the planets of the pious living entities, is born into a family of righteous people, or into a family of rich aristocracy.” Mother Śacī, a *nitya-siddha* living entity, is an incarnation of mother Yaśodā. She appeared in the house of Nīlāmbara Cakravartī and was everlastingly engaged in the service of Lord Viṣṇu. Later she directly had as her child Lord Viṣṇu, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and she served Him from the day of His appearance. This is the position of *nitya-siddha* associates. Śrī Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura therefore sings: *gaurāṅgera saṅgi-gaṇe nitya-siddha kari māne.* Every devotee should know that all the associates of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu — His family members, friends and other associates — were all *nitya-siddhas. A nitya-siddha* never forgets the service of the Lord. He is always engaged, even from childhood, in worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

### Translation

**Since Advaita Ācārya was giving alms and food to Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, the other devotees, headed by Śrīvāsa Ṭhākura, also desired to give Him alms and invite Him for lunch.**

### Purport

It is the duty of all *gṛhasthas* to invite a *sannyāsī* to their homes if he happens to be in the neighborhood or village. This very system is still current in India. If a *sannyāsī* is in the neighborhood of a village, he is invited by all householders, one after another. As long as a *sannyāsī* remains in the village, he enlightens the inhabitants in spiritual understanding. In other words, a *sannyāsī* has no housing or food problems even when he travels extensively. Even though Advaita Ācārya was supplying Caitanya Mahāprabhu with *prasādam,* the other devotees from Navadvīpa and Śāntipura also desired to offer Him *prasādam.*

### Translation

**Śacīmātā said, “It will be a great happiness for me if Nimāi \[Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu\] stays here. But at the same time, if someone blames Him, it will be my great unhappiness.”**

### Purport

It is a great happiness for a mother if her son does not leave home to search out Kṛṣṇa but remains with her. At the same time, if a son does not search after Kṛṣṇa but simply remains at home, he is certainly blamed by experienced saintly persons. Such blame certainly causes great unhappiness for a mother. If a real mother wants her son to progress spiritually, she had better allow him to go out searching for Kṛṣṇa. The mother naturally desires the welfare of the son. If a mother does not allow her son to search for Kṛṣṇa, she is called *mā,* which indicates *māyā.* By allowing her son to go as a *sannyāsī* and search for Kṛṣṇa, Śacīmātā instructs all mothers of the world. She indicates that all sons should become real devotees of Kṛṣṇa and should not stay at home under the care of an affectionate mother. This is supported by *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (5.5.18):

*gurur na sa syāt sva-jano na sa syāt *
 *pitā na sa syāj jananī na sā syāt  
daivaṁ na tat syān na patiś ca sa syān *
 *na mocayed yaḥ samupeta-mṛtyum*

“No one should become a spiritual master — nor a relative, father, mother, worshipable Deity or husband — if he cannot help a person escape the imminent path of death.” Every living entity is wandering within the universe, subjected to the law of *karma* and transmigrating from one body to another and from one planet to another. Therefore the whole Vedic process is meant to save the wandering living entities from the clutches of *māyā* — birth, death, disease and old age. This means stopping the cycle of birth and death. This cycle can be stopped only if one worships Kṛṣṇa. As the Lord says in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (4.9):

*janma karma ca me divyam* *evaṁ yo vetti tattvataḥ  
tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma* *naiti mām eti so ’rjuna*

“One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna.”

To stop the cycle of birth and death, one has to understand Kṛṣṇa as He is. Simply by knowing Kṛṣṇa, one can stop the process of rebirth into this material world. By acting in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, one can return to Godhead. The highest perfection of life is for a father, mother, spiritual master, husband or any other family member to help others return home, back to Godhead. That is the most preferred welfare activity for the benefit of relatives. Therefore, Śacīmātā, although the mother of Nimāi Paṇḍita, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, considered all the facts and decided to allow her son to go out and search for Kṛṣṇa. At the same time, she made some arrangements in order that she might get news of all the activities of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

*ghare* *yāñā* — returning home; *kara* — kindly do; *sadā* — always; *kṛṣṇa*-*saṅkīrtana* — chanting of the holy name of the Lord; *kṛṣṇa*-*nāma* — the holy name of the Lord; *kṛṣṇa*-*kathā* — discussion of Kṛṣṇa’s pastimes; *kṛṣṇa* — of Lord Kṛṣṇa; *ārādhana* — worshiping.

### Translation

**Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu requested them all to return home and begin chanting the holy name congregationally. He also requested them to worship Kṛṣṇa, chant His holy name and discuss His holy pastimes.**

### Purport

The cult of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement, is very nicely explained by Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu authoritatively. It is not that everyone has to take *sannyāsa* like Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Everyone can execute the cult of Kṛṣṇa consciousness at home, as ordered by the Lord. Everyone can congregationally chant the holy name of Kṛṣṇa, the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra.* One can also discuss the subject matter of the *Bhagavad-gītā* and *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* and install Deities of Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa or Gaura-Nitāi or both and worship them very carefully in one’s own home. It is not that we have to open different centers all over the world. Whoever cares for the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement can install Deities at home and, under superior guidance, worship the Deity regularly, chanting the *mahā-mantra* and discussing the *Bhagavad-gītā* and *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.* We are actually teaching in our classes how to go about this. One who feels that he is not yet ready to live in a temple or undergo strict regulative principles in the temple — especially householders who live with a wife and children — can start a center at home by installing the Deity, worshiping the Lord morning and evening, chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa and discussing the *Bhagavad-gītā* and *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.* Anyone can do this at home without difficulty, and Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu requested all the devotees present there to do so.

### Purport

Although Śrīla Haridāsa Ṭhākura was born in a Muslim family, he was accepted as a properly initiated *brāhmaṇa.* As such, he had every right to enter the temple of Jagannātha Purī, but because there were some rules and regulations stipulating that only *brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas, vaiśyas* and *śūdras* (members of the *varṇāśrama-dharma* system) could enter, Haridāsa Ṭhākura, out of his great humility, did not want to violate these existing rules. He therefore said that he did not have the strength to enter into the temple, and he pointed out that if Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu lived within the temple, there would be no way for Haridāsa Ṭhākura to see Him. Later, when Haridāsa Ṭhākura went to Jagannātha Purī, he lived outside the temple, at a place called Siddhabakula. A monastery has now been erected there, known as Siddhabakula Maṭha. People who visit Jagannātha Purī often go to see Siddhabakula and the tomb of Haridāsa Ṭhākura, on the beach by the sea.

**In this way all the opulences of Advaita Ācārya — His faith, devotion, home, riches and everything else — were successfully utilized in the worship of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu.**

### Purport

Advaita Ācārya set an ideal example for all householder devotees in His reception of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu and His devotees and in His execution of a daily festival at His home. If one has the proper means and wealth, he should occasionally invite the devotees of Lord Caitanya who are engaged in preaching all over the world and hold a festival at home simply by distributing *prasādam* and talking about Kṛṣṇa during the day and holding congregational chanting for at least three hours in the evening. This procedure must be adopted in all centers of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. Thus they will daily perform *saṅkīrtana-yajña.* In *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (11.5.32) the daily performance of *saṅkīrtana-yajña* is recommended for this age (*yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana-prāyair yajanti hi su-medhasaḥ*). One should worship Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu and His four associates, the Pañca-tattva, by distributing *prasādam* and holding congregational chanting. Indeed, that *yajña* or sacrifice, is most recommended in this Age of Kali. In this age, other *yajñas* are not possible to perform, but this *yajña* can be performed everywhere and anywhere without difficulty.

### Translation

**Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was unaffected. He left swiftly, and Advaita Ācārya followed Him, weeping.**

### Purport

As Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura explains, the word *nirapekṣa* means not being affected by anything material and remaining fixed in the service of the Lord. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu did not very much care for the roaring tumult and cry at the house of Advaita Ācārya, which He heard when starting for Jagannātha Purī. Worldly moralists may criticize Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu for being very cruel, but the Lord did not care for such criticism. As the world teacher of this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, He actually showed that a person seriously engaged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness should not be affected by worldly affection. The best course is to engage in rendering service to the Lord and to become callous to material objectives. Externally everyone is attached to material things, but if one becomes entangled in such things, he cannot make progress in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Therefore those who are engaged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness should not care for the so-called morality of the material world if that morality opposes the service of the Lord. As Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu has personally shown, one cannot properly execute Kṛṣṇa consciousness without being neutral.

### Purport

In the southern section of the Eastern Railway, in the district of twenty-four *pargaṇās,* is a station named Magrāhāṭa. If one goes to the southeastern side of that station for some fourteen miles, there is a place called Jayanagara. About six miles south of this Jayanagara station is a village named Chatrabhoga. Sometimes this village is called Khāḍi. In this village is a Deity of Lord Śiva known as Vaijurkānātha. A festival takes place there every year during the month of Caitra (March-April). The festival is known as Nandā-melā. At the present moment the Ganges does not flow there. On the same railway line is another station, known as Bāruipura, and near this station is another place, called Āṭisārā. Formerly this village was also situated on the banks of the Ganges. One can go from this village to Pānihāṭi and from there to Varāha-nagara, north of Calcutta. In those days the Ganges flowed to the south of Calcutta through Kālī-ghāṭa, which is still known as Ādi-gaṅgā*.* From Bāruipura, the Ganges branched out and flowed through Diamond Harbour near the Mathurāpura police station. It is to be noted that Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu passed through all these places on His way to Jagannātha Purī.
