+++
CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR

The following summary of this chapter is given by Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura in his *Amṛta-pravāha-bhāṣya.* According to Śrī Sanātana Gosvāmī’s request, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu explained the well-known *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* verse beginning *ātmārāmāś ca munayaḥ.* He explained this verse in sixty-one different ways. He analyzed all the words and described each word with its different connotations. Adding the words *ca* and *api,* He described all the different meanings of the verse. He then concluded that different classes of transcendentalists (*jñānīs, karmīs, yogīs*) utilize this verse according to their own interpretation, but if they would give up this process and surrender to Kṛṣṇa, as indicated by the verse itself, they would be able to comprehend the real meaning of the verse. In this regard, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu narrated a story about how the great sage Nārada converted a hunter into a great Vaiṣṇava, and how this was appreciated by Nārada’s friend Parvata Muni. Sanātana Gosvāmī then offered a prayer to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu explained the glory of *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.* After this, the Lord gave Sanātana Gosvāmī a synopsis of *Hari-bhakti-vilāsa,* which Sanātana Gosvāmī later developed into the guiding principle of all Vaiṣṇavas.

### Purport

In Sanskrit the verb “to do” has two forms, technically called *parasmai-pada* and *ātmane-pada.* When things are done for one’s personal satisfaction, the form is called *ātmane-pada.* In that case, the word “do” in English is *kurvate* in sanskrit. When things are done for others, the verb form changes to *kurvanti.* Thus Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu informed Sanātana Gosvāmī that in the *ātmārāma* verse the verb *kurvanti* means that things should be done only for the satisfaction of Kṛṣṇa. This is supported by the grammarian Pāṇini. The verb is formed as *ātmane-pada* when the work is to be done for one’s own benefit, and when it is done for others, it is called *parasmai-pada.* Thus the verb is formed according to whether something is done for one’s self-satisfaction or for another’s satisfaction.

### Purport

This verse (*Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* 10.52.37) was written by Rukmiṇīdevī in a letter to Kṛṣṇa inviting Him to kidnap her. Śukadeva Gosvāmī described this to Mahārāja Parīkṣit when the King asked him how Rukmiṇī had been kidnapped. Rukmiṇī had heard about Kṛṣṇa’s qualities from different people, and after she heard about them, she decided to accept Kṛṣṇa as her husband. Everything had been arranged for her marriage to Śiśupāla; therefore she wrote a letter to Kṛṣṇa, which she sent through a *brāhmaṇa,* and invited Him to kidnap her.

However, Kṛṣṇa assures the devotee, *ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi mā śucaḥ:* “I will protect you from all sinful reactions. Do not fear.” The word *sarva-pāpebhyaḥ* indicates four kinds of sinful activities. As soon as the devotee surrenders unto Kṛṣṇa’s lotus feet, he is certainly relieved from all sinful activities and their results. The four basic sinful activities are summarized as illicit sex, intoxication, gambling and meat-eating.

### Translation

**“ ‘O best among the Bharatas \[Arjuna\], four kinds of pious men render devotional service unto Me — the distressed, the desirer of wealth, the inquisitive and he who is searching for knowledge of the Absolute.’**

### Purport

This is a quotation from the *Bhagavad-gītā* (7.16). The word *sukṛtinaḥ* is very important in this verse. *Su* means “auspicious,” and *kṛtī* means “meritorious” or “regulated.” Unless one follows the regulative principles of religious life, human life is no different from animal life. Religious life means following the principles of *varṇa* and *āśrama.* In the *Viṣṇu Purāṇa* it is said:

*varṇāśramācāravatā* *puruṣeṇa paraḥ pumān  
viṣṇur ārādhyate panthā* *nānyat tat-toṣa-kāraṇam*

According to religious life, society is divided into four social divisions — *brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya* and *śūdra* — and four spiritual divisions — *brahmacarya, gṛhastha, vānaprastha* and *sannyāsa.* One needs to be trained to become a *brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya* or *śūdra,* just as one is trained to become an engineer, doctor or lawyer. Those who are properly trained can be considered human beings; if one is not trained socially and spiritually — that is, if one is uneducated and unregulated — his life is on the animal platform. Among animals there is no question of spiritual advancement. Spiritual life can be attained by proper training — either by following the principles of *varṇa* and *āśrama* or by being directly trained in the *bhakti* school by the methods of *śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ smaraṇaṁ pāda-sevanam/ arcanaṁ vandanaṁ dāsyaṁ sakhyam ātma-nivedanam.* Without being trained, one cannot be *sukṛtī,* auspicious. In this verse Kṛṣṇa says that people approach Him when in distress, in need of money or when actually inquisitive to understand the Supreme Being, or the original source of everything. Some people approach Him in the pursuit of knowledge of the Absolute Truth, and others approach Him when they are distressed, like the devotee Gajendra. Others are inquisitive, like the great sages headed by Śaunaka, and others need money, like Dhruva Mahārāja. Śukadeva Gosvāmī approached the Lord when he pursued knowledge. All these great personalities thus took to the devotional service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa.

### Translation

**“ ‘The intelligent, who have understood the Supreme Lord in the association of pure devotees and have become free from bad, materialistic association, can never avoid hearing the glories of the Lord, even though they have heard them only once.’**

### Purport

This is a verse from *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (1.10.11). All the members of the Kuru dynasty offered respects when Kṛṣṇa was leaving Hastināpura after the Battle of Kurukṣetra. Kṛṣṇa was going to His own kingdom, and all the members of the Kuru dynasty were overwhelmed by His departure. This verse was spoken in that connection by Sūta Gosvāmī.

A pure devotee becomes attached to Kṛṣṇa by hearing the Lord’s glories. The Lord’s glories and the Lord Himself are identical. One has to be qualified to understand this absolute truth; therefore one should be given a chance to associate with a pure devotee. Our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is meant for this purpose. We want to create pure devotees so that other people will benefit by their association. In this way the number of pure devotees increases. Professional preachers cannot create pure devotees. There are many professional preachers of *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* who read this work to earn their livelihood. However, they cannot convert materialistic people to devotional service. Only a pure devotee can convert others to pure devotional service. It is therefore important for all the preachers in our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement to first become pure devotees and follow the regulative principles, refraining from illicit sex, meat-eating, gambling and intoxication. They should regularly chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra* on their beads, follow the devotional process, rise early in the morning, attend *maṅgala-ārati* and recite *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* and the *Bhagavad-gītā* regularly. In this way, one can become purified and free from all material contamination.

*sarvopādhi-vinirmuktaṁ* *tat-paratvena nirmalam  
hṛṣīkeṇa hṛṣīkeśa-* *sevanaṁ bhaktir ucyate*

“*Bhakti,* or devotional service, means engaging all one’s senses in the service of the Lord, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the master of all the senses. When the spirit soul renders service unto the Supreme, there are two side effects. One is freed from all material designations, and one’s senses are purified simply by being employed in the service of the Lord.” (*Nārada-pañcarātra*)

To make a show of devotional service will not help one. One must be a pure devotee following the devotional process; then one can convert others to devotional service. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu practiced devotional service and preached (*āpani ācari’ bhakti karila pracāra*). If a preacher behaves properly in devotional service, he will be able to convert others. Otherwise, his preaching will have no effect.

### Translation

**“ ‘The great scripture Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, compiled by Mahāmuni Vyāsadeva from four original verses, describes the most elevated and kindhearted devotees and completely rejects the cheating ways of materially motivated religiosity. It propounds the highest principle of eternal religion, which can factually mitigate the threefold miseries of a living being and award the highest benediction of full prosperity and knowledge. Those willing to hear the message of this scripture in a submissive attitude of service can at once capture the Supreme Lord in their hearts. Therefore there is no need for any scripture other than Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.’**

### Translation

**“Association with a devotee, the mercy of Kṛṣṇa, and the nature of devotional service help one to give up all undesirable association and gradually attain elevation to the platform of love of Godhead.**

### Purport

This verse-refers to the association of pure devotees, the mercy of Kṛṣṇa and the rendering of devotional service. All these help one give up the association of nondevotees and the material opulence awarded by the external energy, *māyā.* A pure devotee is never attracted by material opulence, for he understands that wasting time to acquire material opulence is a misuse of the gift of human life. In *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* it is said, *śrama eva hi kevalam.* In the eyes of a devotee, politicians, social workers, philanthropists, philosophers and humanitarians are simply wasting their time, for human society is not freed from the cycle of birth and death by their activity and propaganda. These so-called philanthropists, politicians and philosophers have no knowledge because they do not know that there is life after death. Understanding that there is life after death is the beginning of spiritual knowledge. A person can understand himself and what he is simply by understanding the first lessons of the *Bhagavad-gītā* (2.13):

*dehino ’smin yathā dehe* *kaumāraṁ yauvanaṁ jarā  
tathā dehāntara-prāptir* *dhīras tatra na muhyati*

“As the embodied soul continuously passes, in this body, from boyhood to youth to old age, the soul similarly passes into another body at death. A sober person is not bewildered by such a change.”

Not knowing the real science of life, a foolish person engages in the temporary activities of this life and thus becomes further entangled in the cycle of birth and death. He always desires material opulence, which can be attained by *karma, jñāna* and *yoga.* But when one is actually elevated to the devotional platform, he gives up all these desires. This is called *anyābhilāṣitā-śūnya.* Then one becomes a pure devotee.

### Purport

Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura has given the following summary of verses 107-111. Transcendentalists on the path of philosophical speculation can be divided into two categories — the pure worshipers of impersonal Brahman and those who wish to merge into the existence of impersonal Brahman. When one is fully absorbed in the thought that one is not different from the Supreme Absolute Truth, one is said to be a worshiper of the impersonal Brahman. The impersonal worshipers of Brahman can again be divided into three categories — (1) *sādhakas,* those who are nearing perfect execution of the process of Brahman realization; (2) those who are fully absorbed in meditation on Brahman; and (3) those who are on the *brahma-bhūta* platform and have no relationship with material existence. Even though the worshiper of impersonal Brahman can be highly advanced, he cannot attain liberation without discharging devotional service. Anyone who has realized himself as spirit soul can engage in devotional service. This is the verdict of the *Bhagavad-gītā* (18.54):

*brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā* *na śocati na kāṅkṣati  
samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu* *mad-bhaktiṁ labhate parām*

“One who is thus transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman and becomes fully joyful. He never laments or desires to have anything; he is equally disposed to every living entity. In that state he attains pure devotional service unto Me.”

To attain the platform of pure devotional service, one has to become spiritually pure and attain the *brahma-bhūta* platform, which is beyond material anxiety and material discrimination. When one approaches pure devotional service after realizing Brahman, one becomes attracted by pure devotional service. At such a time, by rendering devotional service, one gets a spiritual body with purified senses.

*sarvopādhi-vinirmuktaṁ* *tat-paratvena nirmalam  
hṛṣīkeṇa hṛṣīkeśa-* *sevanaṁ bhaktir ucyate*

When one’s senses are pure, one can render loving devotional service to Kṛṣṇa. A pure devotee can only remember Kṛṣṇa’s transcendental qualities. Remembering them, he fully engages in the loving service of the Lord.

*mumukṣavo ghora-rūpān  
hitvā bhūta-patīn atha  
nārāyaṇa-kalāḥ śāntā

### Synonyms

*mumukṣavaḥ* — those who are perfectly learned, who desire the highest perfection, and who, unlike demons and nondevotees, are never envious of anyone; *ghora*-*rūpān* — demigods with fearful bodily features; *hitvā* — giving up; *bhūta*-*patīn* — the forefathers (*prajāpatis*); *atha* — therefore; *nārāyaṇa*-*kalāḥ* — the plenary expansions of Lord Nārāyaṇa; *śāntāḥ* — very peaceful; *bhajanti* — they worship; *hi* — certainly; *anasūyavaḥ* — nonenvious.

### Translation

**“ ‘Those who want to be relieved from the material clutches give up the worship of the various demigods who have fearful bodily features. Such peaceful devotees, who are not envious of the demigods, worship the different forms of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Nārāyaṇa.’**

### Purport

This is a quotation from the *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (1.2.26). Those who actually want the highest perfection worship Lord Viṣṇu in His different incarnations. Those who are attracted to the materialistic way of life and who are always agitated and full of anxiety worship demigods who appear fierce — demigods like goddess Kālī and Kāla-bhairava (Rudra). The devotees of Kṛṣṇa, however, do not envy the demigods or their worshipers but peacefully render devotional service to the incarnations of Nārāyaṇa instead.

### Verse text

*sei sabera sādhu-saṅge guṇa sphurāya  
kṛṣṇa-bhajana karāya, ‘mumukṣā’ chāḍāya*

### Synonyms

*sei* *sabera* — of all those worshipers of different demigods; *sādhu*-*saṅge* — the contact of real devotees; *guṇa* *sphurāya* — awakens the appreciation of transcendental qualities; *kṛṣṇa*-*bhajana* *karāya* — engages in the devotional service of Lord Kṛṣṇa; *mumukṣā* *chāḍāya* — and causes to give up the desire to be liberated or merge into the impersonal feature of the Lord.

### Translation

**“If those who are attached to demigod worship fortunately associate with the devotees, their dormant devotional service and appreciation of the Lord’s qualities gradually awaken. In this way they also engage in Kṛṣṇa’s devotional service and give up the desire for liberation and the desire to merge into the existence of impersonal Brahman.**

### Purport

The four Kumāras (Catuḥsana), Śukadeva Gosvāmī and the nine Yogendras were absorbed in Brahman realization, and how they became devotees is described herein. There are three kinds of impersonalists — the *mumukṣu* (those desiring liberation), the *jīvan-muktas* (those liberated in this life) and the *prāpta-svarūpas* (those merged in Brahman realization). All three types of *jñānīs* are called *mokṣākāṅkṣīs,* those desiring liberation. By associating with devotees, such people give up the *mumukṣu* principle and render devotional service. The real cause for this change is the association of devotees. The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is meant to attract all types of men, even those who desire things other than the Lord’s devotional service. Through the association of devotees, they gradually begin to render devotional service.

Following his path, they observe the activities of the arteries. Thus they gradually rise to the heart, where subtle Brahman, Paramātmā, is situated. They then worship Him. O unlimited Ananta! Better than these persons are the mystic yogīs who worship You from the top of their heads. Beginning with the abdomen and proceeding through the heart, they reach the top of the head and pass through the brahma-randhra, the hole at the top of the skull. Thus these yogīs attain the perfectional platform and do not enter the cycle of birth and death again.’**

### Translation

**“ ‘The transcendental position cannot be attained by wandering up and down from Brahmaloka and Satyaloka to Pātālaloka. If one is actually intelligent and learned, he should endeavor for that rare transcendental position. By the force of time one attains whatever material happiness is available within the fourteen worlds, just as one attains distress in due course of time. But since spiritual consciousness is not attained in this way, one should try for it.’**

### Purport

This verse was spoken by Nārada Muni in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (1.5.18). Nārada Muni was speaking to Vyāsadeva, who was morose even after he had compiled all the Vedic literatures. In this connection, Nārada Muni advised Śrīla Vyāsadeva to try to attain devotional service and nothing else.

### Translation

**“ ‘Devotional perfection is very difficult to attain for two reasons. First, unless one is attached to Kṛṣṇa, he cannot attain devotional perfection even if he renders devotional service for a long time. Second, Kṛṣṇa does not easily deliver perfection in devotional service.’**

### Purport

As stated in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (5.6.18), *muktiṁ dadāti karhicit.* Śrīla Śukadeva Gosvāmī told Mahārāja Parīkṣit that Kṛṣṇa readily grants liberation but does not very readily grant perfection in devotional service. This means that Kṛṣṇa wants to see that a devotee is actually sincere and serious and that he does not have ulterior motives. If this is the case, devotional service can very easily be successful; otherwise it is very difficult to obtain from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This verse appears in the *Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu* (1.1.35).

Although the ocean of nescience is vast, they can still cross over it. What, then, is the difficulty for those who are advanced in Vedic knowledge?’**

### Purport

This is a quotation from *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (2.7.46). Lord Brahmā said this when speaking to his disciple Nārada about the wonderful characteristics of Lord Viṣṇu. Simply by chanting the glories of Lord Viṣṇu, one can cross the ocean of nescience, even though one may be lowborn.

### Purport

It is here mentioned that every living entity is *ātmārāma.* Temporarily covered by the influence of *māyā,* the living entity serves his senses, which are represented as *kāma-krodha-lobha-moha-mada-mātsarya* — lust, anger, greed, illusion, madness and envy*.* In the material condition, all living entities are engaged in sense gratification, but when they associate with devotees who follow the regulative principles, they become purified and awakened to their original consciousness.

### Purport

This is confirmed in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (9.32), wherein the Lord says:

*māṁ hi pārtha vyapāśritya* *ye ’pi syuḥ pāpa-yonayaḥ  
striyo vaiśyās tathā śūdrās* *te ’pi yānti parāṁ gatim*

“O son of Pṛthā, those who take shelter in Me, though they be of lower birth — women, *vaiśyas* \[merchants\] and *śūdras* \[workers\] — can attain the supreme destination.”

Everyone is eligible to become Kṛṣṇa’s devotee. One simply has to be trained according to the approved process. It is the work of Kṛṣṇa’s confidential devotees to turn everyone into a Kṛṣṇa *bhakta.* If the confidential devotees do not take up the task of elevating everyone to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then who will do it? Those who claim to be devotees but do not engage in Kṛṣṇa’s service to elevate all living creatures to Kṛṣṇa consciousness are to be considered *kaniṣṭha-adhikārīs* (people in the lowest stage of devotional service). When one rises to the second platform of devotional service, his business is to propagate Kṛṣṇa consciousness all over the world. Those who are active in the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement should not remain in the neophyte stage but should rise to the platform of preachers, the second platform of devotional service. Devotional service is so enchanting that even the first-class devotees (*uttama-adhikārīs*) also come down to the second platform to preach and render service to the Lord for the benefit of the whole world.

All these things are certainly very wonderful.’**

### Purport

This is a quotation from *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (10.21.19). As Kṛṣṇa wandered in the forest with Baladeva and the two of Them wonderfully played Their flutes, all the *gopīs* became very much attracted. Thus they praised the Lord’s activities, describing how He was enthusing all the plants, birds, hills, water — everything.

### Translation

**“ ‘Those who follow the path of great, saintly mystic yogīs take to the yogic gymnastic process and begin worshiping from the abdomen, where it is said that Brahman is located. Such people are called śārkarākṣa, which means that they are situated in the gross bodily conception. There are also followers of the ṛṣi known as Āruṇa. Following his path, they observe the activities of the arteries. Thus they gradually rise to the heart, where subtle Brahman, Paramātmā, is situated. They then worship Him. O unlimited Ananta! Better than these persons are the mystic yogīs who worship You from the top of their heads. Beginning with the abdomen and proceeding through the heart, they reach the top of the head and pass through the brahma-randhra, the hole at the top of the skull. Thus these yogīs attain the perfectional platform and do not enter the cycle of birth and death again.’**

At that time, all the *ṛṣis* assembled there neglected to complete the ritualistic ceremonies because there was no positive assurance of the results. All the performers were coated with black ash due to the large amount of smoke coming from the fire.

### Translation

**“Once upon a time the great saint Nārada, after visiting Lord Nārāyaṇa in the Vaikuṇṭhas, went to Prayāga to bathe at the confluence of three rivers — the Ganges, Yamunā and Sarasvatī.**

### Purport

The great saint Nārada is so liberated that he can go to the Vaikuṇṭha planets to see Nārāyaṇa and then immediately come to this planet in the material world and go to Prayāga to bathe in the confluence of three rivers. The word *tri-veṇī* refers to a confluence of three rivers. This confluence is still visited by many hundreds of thousands of people who go there to bathe, especially during the Māgha-melā, which occurs during the month of January. A liberated person who has no material body can go anywhere and everywhere; therefore a living entity is called *sarva-ga,* which indicates that he can go anywhere and everywhere. Presently scientists are trying to go to other planets, but due to their material bodies, they are not free to move at will. However, when one is situated in his original spiritual body, he can move anywhere and everywhere without difficulty. Within this material world there is a planet called Siddhaloka, whose inhabitants can go from one planet to another without the aid of a machine or space rocket. In the material world every planet has a specific advantage (*vibhūti-bhinna*). In the spiritual world, however, all the planets and their inhabitants are composed of spiritual energy. Because there are no material impediments, it is said that everything in the spiritual world is one.

### Translation

**“Nārada Muni replied, ‘If you leave the animals half-dead, you are purposefully giving them pain. Therefore you will have to suffer in retaliation.’**

### Purport

This is an authoritative statement given by the greatest authority, Nārada Muni. If one gives another living entity unnecessary pain, one will certainly be punished by the laws of nature with a similar pain. Although the hunter Mṛgāri was uncivilized, he still had to suffer the results of his sinful activities. However, if a civilized man kills animals regularly in a slaughterhouse to maintain his so-called civilization, using scientific methods and machines to kill animals, one cannot even estimate the suffering awaiting him. So-called civilized people consider themselves very advanced in education, but they do not know about the stringent laws of nature. According to nature’s law, it is a life for a life. We can hardly imagine the sufferings of one who maintains a slaughterhouse. He endures suffering not only in this life, but in his next life also. It is said that a hunter, murderer or killer is advised not to live and not to die. If he lives, he accumulates even more sins, which bring about more suffering in a future life. He is advised not to die because his dying means that he immediately begins to endure more suffering. Therefore he is advised not to live and not to die.

As followers of the Vedic principles, we accept the statements of Nārada Muni in this regard. It is our duty to see that no one suffers due to sinful activities. Foolish rascals are described in the *Bhagavad-gītā* as *māyayāpahṛta-jñānāḥ,* which indicates that although they are superficially educated, *māyā* has taken their real knowledge away. Such people are presently leading human society. In *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* they are described as *andhā yathāndhair upanīyamānāḥ.* These rascals are themselves blind, and yet they are leading others who are blind. When people follow such leaders, they suffer unlimited pains in the future. Despite so-called advancement, all this is happening. Who is safe? Who is happy? Who is without anxiety?

### Translation

**“Nārada Muni continued, ‘My dear hunter, your business is killing animals. That is a slight offense on your part. But when you consciously give them unnecessary pain by leaving them half-dead, you incur very great sins.’**

### Purport

This is another good instruction to animal-killers. There are always animal-killers and animal-eaters in human society because less civilized people are accustomed to eating meat. In the Vedic civilization, meat-eaters are advised to kill an animal for the goddess Kālī or a similar demigod. This is in order not to give the animal unnecessary pain, as slaughterhouses do. In the *bali-dāna* sacrifice to a demigod, it is recommended to cut the throat of an animal with one slice. This should be done on a dark-moon night, and the painful noises expressed by the animal at the time of being slaughtered are not to be heard by anyone. There are also many other restrictions. Slaughter is allowed only once a month, and the killer of the animal has to suffer similar pains in his next life. At the present moment, so-called civilized men do not sacrifice animals to a deity in a religious or ritualistic way. They openly kill animals daily by the thousands for no purpose other than the satisfaction of the tongue. Because of this the entire world is suffering in so many ways. Politicians are unnecessarily declaring war, and according to the stringent laws of material nature, massacres are taking place between nations.

*prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni* *guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ  
ahaṅkāra-vimūḍhātmā* *kartāham iti manyate*

“The bewildered spirit soul, under the influence of the three modes of material nature, thinks himself to be the doer of activities that are in actuality carried out by nature.” (Bg. 3.27) The laws of *prakṛti* (nature) are very stringent. No one should think that he has the freedom to kill animals and not suffer the consequences. One cannot be safe by doing this. Nārada Muni herein says that animal-killing is offensive, especially when animals are given unnecessary pain. Meat-eaters and animal-killers are advised not to purchase meat from the slaughterhouse. They can worship Kālī once a month, kill some unimportant animal and eat it. Even by following this method, one is still an offender.

*kadarthiyā* — giving unnecessary pains; *tumi* — you; *yata* — all; *mārilā* — killed; *jīvere* — the living entities; *tārā* — all of them; *taiche* — similarly; *tomā* — you; *māribe* — will kill; *janma*-*janma*-*antare* — life after life.

### Translation

**“Nārada Muni continued, ‘All the animals that you have killed and given unnecessary pain will kill you one after the other in your next life and in life after life.’**

### Purport

This is another authoritative statement made by the great sage Nārada. Those who kill animals and give them unnecessary pain — as people do in slaughterhouses — will be killed in a similar way in the next life and in many lives to come. One can never be excused from such an offense. If one kills many thousands of animals in a professional way so that other people can purchase the meat to eat, one must be ready to be killed in a similar way in his next life and in life after life. There are many rascals who violate their own religious principles. According to Judeo-Christian scriptures, it is clearly said, “Thou shalt not kill.” Nonetheless, giving all kinds of excuses, even the heads of religions indulge in killing animals while trying to pass as saintly persons. This mockery and hypocrisy in human society bring about unlimited calamities; therefore occasionally there are great wars. Masses of such people go out onto battlefields and kill themselves. Presently they have discovered the atomic bomb, which is simply waiting to be used for wholesale destruction. If people want to be saved from the killing business life after life, they must take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness and cease sinful activity. The International Society for Krishna Consciousness recommends that everyone abandon meat-eating, illicit sex, intoxication and gambling. When one gives up these sinful activities, he can understand Kṛṣṇa and take to this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. We therefore request everyone to abandon sinful activity and chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra.* In this way people can save themselves from repeated birth and death and from being killed like the animals in slaughterhouses.

### Synonyms

*nārada*-*saṅge* — in the association of the great sage Nārada Muni; *vyādhera* — of the hunter; *mana* — the mind; *parasanna* *ha*-*ila* — became cleansed and satisfied; *tāṅra* — his; *vākya* — words; *śuni’* — hearing; *mane* — in the mind; *bhaya* *upajila* — some fear arose.

### Translation

**“In this way, through the association of the great sage Nārada Muni, the hunter was a little convinced of his sinful activity. He therefore became somewhat afraid due to his offenses.**

### Purport

This is the effect of associating with a pure devotee. Our preachers who are preaching Kṛṣṇa consciousness all over the world should follow in the footsteps of Nārada Muni and become purified by following the four principles and chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra.* This will make them fit to become Vaiṣṇavas. Then, when they speak to sinful people about the teachings of this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, people will be affected and take the instructions. We receive instructions in devotional service through the disciplic succession. Nārada Muni is our original *guru* because he is the spiritual master of Vyāsadeva. Vyāsadeva is the spiritual master of our disciplic succession; therefore we should follow in the footsteps of Nārada Muni and become pure Vaiṣṇavas. A pure Vaiṣṇava is one who has no ulterior motive. He has totally dedicated himself to the service of the Lord. He does not have material desires, and he is not interested in so-called learning and philanthropic work. The so-called learned scholars and philanthropists are actually *karmīs* and *jñānīs,* and some are actually misers engaged in sinful activity. All are condemned because they are not devotees of Lord Kṛṣṇa.

Everyone has a chance to become purified by associating with this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement and strictly following the rules and regulations. By chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra,* one can become free from all contamination, especially contamination brought about by the killing of animals. Lord Kṛṣṇa Himself requests:

*sarva-dharmān parityajya* *mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja  
ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo* *mokṣayiṣyāmi mā śucaḥ*

“Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. I shall deliver you from all sinful reactions. Do not fear.” (Bg. 18.66)

We should take this instruction from Kṛṣṇa and follow in the footsteps of Nārada Muni in the disciplic succession. If we simply surrender unto Kṛṣṇa’s lotus feet and take this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement seriously, we can be freed from the *karma* incurred by sin. If we are intelligent enough, we shall engage in the loving service of the Lord. Then our lives will be successful, and we shall not have to suffer like the hunter life after life. By killing animals, not only will we be bereft of the human form but we will have to take an animal form and somehow or other be killed by the same type of animal we have killed. This is the law of nature. The Sanskrit word *māṁsa* means “meat.” It is said, *māṁ saḥ khadati iti māṁsaḥ.* That is, “I am now eating the flesh of an animal who will some day in the future be eating my flesh.”

kemane tarimu muñi pāmara adhama?*

### Synonyms

*vyādha* *kahe* — the hunter said; *bālya* *haite* — from the very beginning of my childhood; *ei* *āmāra* *karma* — I have been taught this business (half-killing animals); *kemane* — how; *tarimu* — shall become free from these sinful activities; *muñi* — I; *pāmara* *adhama* — sinful and misled.

### Translation

**“The hunter then admitted that he was convinced of his sinful activity, and he said, ‘I have been taught this business from my very childhood. Now I am wondering how I can become freed from these unlimited volumes of sinful activity.’**

### Purport

This kind of admission is very beneficial as long as one does not again commit sin. Cheating and hypocrisy are not tolerated by higher authorities. If one understands what sin is, he should give it up with sincerity and regret and surrender unto the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead through His agent, the pure devotee. In this way, one can be freed from the reactions of sin and make progress in devotional service. However, if one continues committing sins after making some atonement, he will not be saved. In the *śāstras,* such atonement is compared to an elephant’s bathing. An elephant takes a very good bath and cleanses its body very nicely, but as soon as it comes out of the water, it picks up some dust on the shore and throws it all over its body. Atonement may be carried out very nicely, but it will not help a person if he continues committing sins. Therefore the hunter first admitted his sinful activity before the saintly person Nārada and then asked how he could be saved.

### Synonyms

*ei* — this; *pāpa* *yāya* *mora* — sinful reactions of my life can be washed off; *kemana* *upāye* — by what means; *nistāra* *karaha* *more* — kindly deliver me; *paḍoṅ* — I fall down; *tomāra* *pāye* — at your lotus feet.

### Translation

**“The hunter continued, ‘My dear sir, please tell me how I can be relieved from the reactions of my sinful life. Now I fully surrender unto you and fall down at your lotus feet. Please deliver me from sinful reactions.’**

### Purport

By the grace of Nārada Muni, the hunter came to his good senses and immediately surrendered unto the saint’s lotus feet. This is the process. By associating with a saintly person, one is able to understand the reactions of his sinful life. When one voluntarily surrenders to a saintly person who is a representative of Kṛṣṇa and follows his instructions, one can become freed from sinful reactions. Kṛṣṇa demands the surrender of a sinful man, and Kṛṣṇa’s representative gives the same instructions. The representative of Kṛṣṇa never tells his disciple, “Surrender unto me.” Rather he says, “Surrender unto Kṛṣṇa.” If the disciple accepts this principle and surrenders himself through the representative of Kṛṣṇa, his life is saved.

One must follow the instructions of a spiritual master; then one will certainly be delivered from all sinful reactions. This is the secret of success. *Yasya deve parā bhaktir yathā deve tathā gurau.* If one has unflinching faith in Kṛṣṇa and the spiritual master, the result is *tasyaite kathitā hy arthāḥ prakāśante mahātmanaḥ:* all the conclusions of the revealed scriptures will be open to such a person. A pure devotee of Kṛṣṇa can make the same demands that Nārada Muni is making. He says, “If you follow my instructions, I shall take responsibility for your liberation.” A pure devotee like Nārada can give assurance to any sinful man because by the grace of the Lord such a devotee is empowered to deliver any sinful person if that person follows the principles set forth.

व्याध कहे, — ‘येइ कह, सेइ त’ करिव’ ।  
नारद कहे, — ‘धनुक भाङ्ग, तवे से कहिव’ ॥ २५६ ॥

### Verse text

*vyādha kahe, — ‘yei kaha, sei ta’ kariba’  
nārada kahe, — ‘dhanuka bhāṅga, tabe se kahiba’*

### Synonyms

*vyādha* *kahe* — the hunter replied; *yei* *kaha* — whatever you say; *sei* *ta’* *kariba* — that I shall do; *nārada* *kahe* — Nārada Muni replied; *dhanuka* *bhāṅga* — break your bow; *tabe* — then; *se* *kahiba* — I shall speak to you.

### Translation

**“The hunter then said, ‘My dear sir, whatever you say I shall do.’**

### Purport

**“Nārada immediately ordered him, ‘First of all, break your bow. Then I shall tell you what is to be done.’**

This is the process of initiation. The disciple must vow that he will no longer commit sinful activity — namely illicit sex, meat-eating, gambling and intoxication. He promises to execute the order of the spiritual master. Then the spiritual master takes care of him and elevates him to spiritual emancipation.

व्याध कहे, — ‘धनुक भाङ्गिले वर्तिव केमने ?’

### Verse text

*vyādha kahe, — ‘dhanuka bhāṅgile vartiba kemane?’  
nārada kahe, — ‘āmi anna diba prati-dine’*

### Synonyms

*vyādha* *kahe* — the hunter replied; *dhanuka* *bhāṅgile* — if I break my bow; *vartiba* *kemane* — what will be the source of my maintenance; *nārada* *kahe* — Nārada Muni replied; *āmi* — I; *anna* — food; *diba* — shall supply; *prati*-*dine* — every day.

### Translation

**“The hunter replied, ‘If I break my bow, how shall I maintain myself?’**

### Purport

**“Nārada Muni replied, ‘Do not worry. I shall supply all your food every day.’**

The source of our income is not actually the source of our maintenance. Every living being — from the great Brahmā down to an insignificant ant — is being maintained by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. *Eko bahūnāṁ yo vidadhāti kāmān.* The one Supreme Being, Kṛṣṇa, maintains everyone. Our so-called source of income is our own choice only. If I wish to be a hunter, it will appear that hunting is the source of my maintenance. If I become a *brāhmaṇa* and completely depend on Kṛṣṇa, I do not conduct a business, but nonetheless my maintenance is supplied by Kṛṣṇa. The hunter was disturbed about breaking his bow because he was worried about his income. Nārada Muni assured the hunter because he knew that the hunter was not being maintained by the bow but by Kṛṣṇa. Being the agent of Kṛṣṇa, Nārada Muni knew very well that the hunter would not suffer by breaking the bow. There was no doubt that Kṛṣṇa would supply him food.

### Verse text

*dhanuka bhāṅgi’ vyādha tāṅra caraṇe paḍila  
tāre uṭhāñā nārada upadeśa kaila*

### Synonyms

*dhanuka* *bhāṅgi’* — breaking the bow; *vyādha* — the hunter; *tāṅra* — his (Nārada Muni’s); *caraṇe* — at the lotus feet; *paḍila* — surrendered; *tāre* — him; *uṭhāñā* — raising; *nārada* — the great saint Nārada Muni; *upadeśa* *kaila* — gave instruction.

### Translation

**“Being thus assured by the great sage Nārada Muni, the hunter broke his bow, immediately fell down at the saint’s lotus feet and fully surrendered. After this, Nārada Muni raised him with his hand and gave him instructions for spiritual advancement.**

### Purport

This is the process of initiation. The disciple must surrender to the spiritual master, the representative of Kṛṣṇa. The spiritual master, being in the disciplic succession stemming from Nārada Muni, is in the same category with Nārada Muni. A person can be relieved from his sinful activity if he surrenders to the lotus feet of a person who actually represents Nārada Muni. Nārada Muni gave instructions to the hunter after the hunter surrendered.

“घरे गिय़ा व्राह्मणे देह’ यत आछे धन ।

### Verse text

*“ghare giyā brāhmaṇe deha’ yata āche dhana  
eka eka vastra pari’ bāhira hao dui-jana*

### Synonyms

*ghare* *giyā* — returning home; *brāhmaṇe* — to the *brāhmaṇas,* the most intelligent men in spiritual understanding; *deha’* — give; *yata* — whatever; *āche* — you have; *dhana* — riches; *eka* *eka* — each of you; *vastra* *pari’* — just one cloth; *bāhira* *hao* — leave home; *dui*-*jana* — both of you.

### Translation

**“Nārada Muni then advised the hunter, ‘Return home and distribute whatever riches you have to the pure brāhmaṇas who know the Absolute Truth. After you have distributed all your riches to the brāhmaṇas, you and your wife should leave home, each of you taking only one cloth to wear.’**

### Purport

This is the process of renunciation at the stage of *vānaprastha.* After enjoying householder life for some time, the husband and wife must leave home and distribute their riches to *brāhmaṇas* and Vaiṣṇavas. One can keep his wife as an assistant in the *vānaprastha* stage. The idea is that the wife will assist the husband in spiritual advancement. Therefore Nārada Muni advised the hunter to adopt the *vānaprastha* stage and leave home. It is not that a *gṛhastha* should live at home until he dies. *Vānaprastha* is preliminary to *sannyāsa.* In the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement there are many young couples engaged in the Lord’s service. Eventually they are supposed to take *vānaprastha,* and after the *vānaprastha* stage the husband may take *sannyāsa* in order to preach. The wife may then remain alone and serve the Deity or engage in other activities within the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement.

*tulasī-parikramā kara, tulasī-sevana  
nirantara kṛṣṇa-nāma kariha kīrtana*

### Synonyms

*tulasī*-*parikramā* *kara* — circumambulate the *tulasī* plant; *tulasī*-*sevana* — just supply water to the root of Tulasī-devī; *nirantara* — continuously; *kṛṣṇa*-*nāma* — the holy name of Kṛṣṇa; *kariha* — just perform; *kīrtana* — chanting.

### Translation

**“ ‘After planting the tulasī tree before your house, you should daily circumambulate that tulasī plant, serve her by giving her water and other things, and continuously chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra.’**

### Purport

This is the beginning of spiritual life. After leaving householder life, one may go to a holy place, such as the bank of the Ganges or Yamunā, and erect a small cottage. A small cottage can be constructed without any expenditure. Four logs serving as pillars can be secured by any man from the forest. The roof can be covered with leaves, and one can cleanse the inside. Thus one can live very peacefully. In any condition, any man can live in a small cottage, plant a *tulasī* tree, water it in the morning, offer it prayers, and continuously chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra.* Thus one can make vigorous spiritual advancement. This is not at all difficult. One simply has to follow the instructions of the spiritual master strictly. Then everything will be successful in due course of time. As far as eating is concerned, there is no problem. If Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, supplies everyone with eatables, why should He not supply His devotee? Sometimes a devotee will not even bother to construct a cottage. He will simply go to live in a mountain cave. One may live in a cave, in a cottage beside a river, in a palace or in a big city like New York or London. In any case, a devotee can follow the instructions of his spiritual master and engage in devotional service by watering the *tulasī* plant and chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra.* Taking the advice of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and our spiritual master, Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Gosvāmī Mahārāja, one can go to any part of the world and instruct people to become devotees of the Lord by following the regulative principles, worshiping the *tulasī* plant and continuously chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra.*

### Translation

**“Nārada Muni continued, ‘Every day I shall send sufficient food to you both. You can take as much food as you want.’**

### Purport

When a person takes to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, there is no need to care for material necessities. Kṛṣṇa says, *yoga-kṣemaṁ vahāmy aham:* “I personally carry all necessities to My devotees.” Why should one be anxious about the necessities of life? The principle should be that one should not want more than what is absolutely necessary. Nārada Muni advises the hunter to accept only what is absolutely necessary for him and his wife. The devotee should always be alert to consume only those things that he absolutely requires and not create unnecessary needs.

### Translation

**“The news that the hunter had become a Vaiṣṇava spread all over the village. Indeed, all the villagers brought alms and presented them to the Vaiṣṇava who had formerly been a hunter.**

### Purport

It is the duty of the public to present a gift to a saintly person, Vaiṣṇava or *brāhmaṇa* when going to see him. Every Vaiṣṇava is dependent on Kṛṣṇa, and Kṛṣṇa is ready to supply all of life’s necessities, provided a Vaiṣṇava follows the principles set forth by the spiritual master. There are certainly many householders in our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. They join the movement and live in the society’s centers, but if they take advantage of this opportunity and do not work but live at the expense of the movement, eating *prasādam* and simply sleeping, they place themselves in a very dangerous position. It is therefore advised that *gṛhasthas* should not live in the temple. They must live outside the temple and maintain themselves. Of course, if the *gṛhasthas* are fully engaged in the Lord’s service according to the directions of the authorities, there is no harm in their living in a temple. In any case, a temple should not be a place to eat and sleep. A temple manager should be very careful about these things.

### Translation

**“Nārada Muni said, ‘My dear hunter, such behavior is not at all astonishing. A man in devotional service is automatically nonviolent. He is the best of gentlemen.**

### Purport

In this verse the word *sādhu-varya* means “the best of gentlemen.” At the present moment there are many so-called gentlemen who are expert in killing animals and birds. Nonetheless, these so-called gentlemen profess a type of religion that strictly prohibits killing. According to Nārada Muni and Vedic culture, animal-killers are not even gentlemen, to say nothing of being religious men. A religious person, a devotee of the Lord, must be nonviolent. Such is the nature of a religious person. It is contradictory to be violent and at the same time call oneself a religious person. Such hypocrisy is not approved by Nārada Muni and the disciplic succession.

### Synonyms

*dekhiyā* — seeing; *vyādhera* — of the hunter; *prema* — the ecstatic love; *parvata*-*mahā*-*muni* — the great sage Parvata Muni; *nāradere* *kahe* — spoke to Nārada Muni; *tumi* *hao* *sparśa*-*maṇi* — you are certainly a touchstone.

### Translation

**“When Parvata Muni saw the ecstatic loving symptoms of the hunter, he told Nārada, ‘Certainly you are a touchstone.’**

### Purport

When a touchstone touches iron, it turns the iron to gold. Parvata Muni called Nārada Muni a touchstone because by his touch the hunter, who was the lowest among men, became an elevated and perfect Vaiṣṇava. Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura said that the position of a Vaiṣṇava can be tested by seeing how good a touchstone he is — that is, by seeing how many Vaiṣṇavas he has made during his life. A Vaiṣṇava should be a touchstone so that he can convert others to Vaiṣṇavism by his preaching, even though people may be fallen like the hunter. There are many so-called advanced devotees who sit in a secluded place for their personal benefit. They do not go out to preach and convert others into Vaiṣṇavas, and therefore they certainly cannot be called *sparśa-maṇi,* advanced devotees. *Kaniṣṭha-adhikārī* devotees cannot turn others into Vaiṣṇavas, but a *madhyama-adhikārī* Vaiṣṇava can do so by preaching. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu advised His followers to increase the numbers of Vaiṣṇavas.

*yāre dekha, tāre kaha ‘kṛṣṇa’-upadeśa  
āmāra ājñāya guru hañā tāra’ ei deśa*

(Cc. *Madhya* 7.128)

It is Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s wish that everyone should become a Vaiṣṇava and *guru.* Following the instructions of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and His disciplic succession, one can become a spiritual master, for the process is very easy. One can go everywhere and anywhere to preach the instructions of Kṛṣṇa. The *Bhagavad-gītā* is Kṛṣṇa’s instructions; therefore the duty of every Vaiṣṇava is to travel and preach the *Bhagavad-gītā,* either in his country or a foreign country. This is the test of *sparśa-maṇi,* following in the footsteps of Nārada Muni.

नारद कहे, — ‘वैष्णव, तोमार अन्न किछु आय़ ?’

### Verse text

*nārada kahe, — ‘vaiṣṇava, tomāra anna kichu āya?’  
vyādha kahe, “yāre pāṭhāo, sei diyā yāya*

### Synonyms

*nārada* *kahe* — Nārada Muni said; *vaiṣṇava* — O Vaiṣṇava; *tomāra* — your; *anna* — food; *kichu* *āya* — does any come; *vyādha* *kahe* — the hunter replied; *yāre* *pāṭhāo* — whoever you send; *sei* — that person; *diyā* — giving something; *yāya* — goes.

### Translation

**“Nārada Muni then asked the hunter, ‘My dear Vaiṣṇava, do you have some income for your maintenance?’**

### Purport

**“The hunter replied, ‘My dear spiritual master, whoever you send gives me something when he comes to see me.’**

This confirms the statement in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (9.22) to the effect that the Lord carries all necessities to His Vaiṣṇava devotee. Nārada Muni asked the former hunter how he was being maintained, and he replied that everyone who came to see him brought him something for his maintenance. Kṛṣṇa, who is situated in everyone’s heart, says, “I personally carry all necessities to a Vaiṣṇava.” He can order anyone to execute this. Everyone is ready to give something to a Vaiṣṇava, and if a Vaiṣṇava is completely engaged in devotional service, he need not be anxious for his maintenance.

sabe dui-janāra yogya bhakṣya-mātra cāi”*

### Synonyms

*eta* *anna* — so much food; *nā* *pāṭhāo* — you do not need to send; *kichu* *kārya* *nāi* — there is no such need; *sabe* — only; *dui*-*janāra* — for two persons; *yogya* — requisite; *bhakṣya*-*mātra* — eatables; *cāi* — we want.

### Translation

**“The former hunter said, ‘Please do not send so much grain. Only send what is sufficient for two people, no more.’**

### Purport

The former hunter only wanted enough for two people to eat, no more. It is not necessary for a Vaiṣṇava to keep a stock of food for the next day. He should receive only sufficient grain to last one day. The next day, he must again depend on the Lord’s mercy. This is the instruction of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. When His personal servant Govinda sometimes kept a stock of *harītakī* (myrobalan), Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu chastised him, saying, “Why did you keep a stock for the next day?” Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī and others were begging daily from door to door for their sustenance, and they never attempted to stock their *āśrama* with food for the next day. We should not materially calculate, thinking, “It is better to stock food for a week. Why give the Lord trouble by having Him bring food daily?” One should be convinced that the Lord will provide daily. There is no need to stock food for the next day.

‘आत्मा’-शव्दे कहे — सर्वविध भगवान् ।

### Verse text

*‘ātmā’-śabde kahe — sarva-vidha bhagavān  
eka ‘svayaṁ bhagavān’, āra ‘bhagavān’-ākhyāna*

### Synonyms

*ātmā*-*śabde* — by the word *ātmā*; *kahe* — it is said; *sarva*-*vidha* *bhagavān* — all types of Personalities of Godhead; *eka* — one; *svayam* *bhagavān* — the original Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa; *āra* — another; *bhagavān*-*ākhyāna* — the Personality of Godhead by an expansive designation.

### Translation

**“The word ‘ātmā’ refers to all the different Personalities of Godhead. One of them is the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself, Kṛṣṇa, and the others are different incarnations or expansions of Kṛṣṇa.**

### Purport

The word *ātmā* also includes all kinds of personalities known as Bhagavān, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This means that Kṛṣṇa has unlimited expansions. This is described in the *Brahma-saṁhitā* (5.46):

*dīpārcir eva hi daśāntaram abhyupetya *
 *dīpāyate vivṛta-hetu-samāna-dharmā  
yas tādṛg eva hi ca viṣṇutayā vibhāti *
 *govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi*

The expansions of Kṛṣṇa are thus compared to candles that have been lit from an original candle. All the secondary candles are equally powerful, but the original candle is that from which all the others have been lit. Kṛṣṇa is the original Supreme Personality of Godhead, and He is expanded as Balarāma, Saṅkarṣaṇa, Aniruddha, Pradyumna and Vāsudeva. In this way there are innumerable incarnations and expansions who are also called Bhagavān, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

Regarding the variety of personalities known as Bhagavān, Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura says that the Personality of Godhead known as Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and that His expansions are also called the Personality of Godhead. In other words, Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the origin of all other Personalities of Godhead. Speculative philosophers and mystic *yogīs* also meditate upon the form of Kṛṣṇa, but this form is not the form of the original Supreme Personality of Godhead. Such a Bhagavān is but a partial representation of the Lord’s full potency. Nonetheless, He also has to be understood to be the Supreme Personality of Godhead. To clarify this matter, one should simply understand that Kṛṣṇa, the son of Nanda Mahārāja in Vṛndāvana, the friend of the cowherd boys and lover of the *gopīs,* is actually the original Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is attained by spontaneous love. Although His expansions are also called the Supreme Personality of Godhead, They are attained only by the execution of regulative devotional service.

### Purport

Devotional service includes nine processes, beginning with hearing, chanting and remembering the activities of Lord Viṣṇu. Only one who has taken to devotional service can understand *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,* which is the spotless *Purāṇa* for a transcendentalist (*paramahaṁsa*). So-called commentaries are useless for this purpose. According to the Vedic injunction, *yasya deve parā bhaktir yathā deve tathā gurau.* All Vedic literatures maintain that *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* has to be learned from the person *bhāgavata,* and to understand it one has to engage in pure devotional service. *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* cannot be understood by so-called erudite scholars or grammarians. One who has developed pure Kṛṣṇa consciousness and has served the pure devotee, the spiritual master, can understand *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.* Others cannot.

### Translation

**“If one becomes a madman like Me, he may also understand the meaning of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam by this process.”**

### Purport

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu plainly explains that *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* cannot be understood by those who are materially situated. In other words, one has to become a madman like Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Apart from being the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is an *ācārya* who exhibited love of God like a madman. According to His own written verse, *yugāyitaṁ nimeṣeṇa.* He says that for Him, “a moment seems to last twelve years.” *Cakṣuṣā prāvṛṣāyitam:* “My tears are flowing like torrents of rain.” *Śūnyāyitaṁ jagat sarvam:* “I feel as if the entire universe were vacant.” Why? *Govinda-viraheṇa me:* “Due to My being separated from Govinda, Kṛṣṇa.”

One can understand *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* only by following in the footsteps of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, who was mad for Kṛṣṇa. We cannot, of course, imitate Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. It is not possible. However, unless one is very serious about understanding Kṛṣṇa, he cannot understand *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* gives the full narration of Kṛṣṇa’s transcendental activities. The first nine cantos explain who Kṛṣṇa is, and the Lord’s birth and activities are narrated in the Tenth Canto. In the *Bhagavad-gītā* it is stated, *janma karma ca me divyam.* Kṛṣṇa’s appearance and disappearance are transcendental, not mundane. A person is eligible to return home, back to Godhead, if he perfectly understands Kṛṣṇa and His appearance and disappearance. This is verified by Kṛṣṇa Himself in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (4.9): *tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti so ’rjuna.*

It is therefore concluded that one has to learn about Kṛṣṇa from *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* and the *Bhagavad-gītā,* and one has to follow in the footsteps of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Those who do not follow Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu cannot understand the *Bhagavad-gītā* and *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.*

### Translation

**“I am a most lowborn person. I have no knowledge of good behavior. How is it possible for me to write authorized directions about Vaiṣṇava activities?”**

### Purport

Actually Sanātana Gosvāmī belonged to a very respectable *brāhmaṇa* family. Nonetheless, he submitted himself as a fallen, lowborn person because he had served in the Muslim government. A *brāhmaṇa* is never supposed to engage in anyone’s service. Serving others for a livelihood (*paricaryātmakaṁ karma*) is the business of *śūdras.* The *brāhmaṇa* is always independent and busy studying *śāstra* and preaching *śāstra* to subordinate social members such as *kṣatriyas* and *vaiśyas.* Sanātana Gosvāmī felt unfit to write Vaiṣṇava *smṛti* about the behavior of Vaiṣṇavas because he had fallen from the brahminical position. Thus Sanātana Gosvāmī clearly admits that the brahminical culture should be standardized. Presently in India, so-called *brāhmaṇas* are almost all engaged in some mundane service, and they do not understand the import of the Vedic *śāstras.* Nonetheless, they are passing themselves off as *brāhmaṇas* on the basis of birth. In this connection, Sanātana Gosvāmī declares that a *brāhmaṇa* cannot be engaged in anyone’s service if he wants to take a leading part in society. In *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* Nārada Muni states that even if a *brāhmaṇa* is in a difficult position, he should not accept the occupation of a *śūdra.* This means that he should not be engaged in service for another, for this is the business of dogs. Under the circumstances, Sanātana Gosvāmī felt very low because he had accepted a position of service in the Muslim government. The conclusion is that no one should claim to be a *brāhmaṇa* simply by birthright while engaging in someone else’s service.

### Translation

**Sanātana Gosvāmī then requested the Lord, “Please personally tell me how I can write this difficult book about Vaiṣṇava behavior. Please manifest Yourself in my heart.**

### Purport

The writing of Vaiṣṇava literatures is not a function for ordinary men. Vaiṣṇava literatures are not mental concoctions. They are all authorized literatures meant to guide those who are going to be Vaiṣṇavas. Under these circumstances, an ordinary man cannot give his own opinion. His opinion must always correspond with the conclusion of the *Vedas.* Unless one is fully qualified in Vaiṣṇava behavior and authorized by superior authority (the Supreme Personality of Godhead), one cannot write Vaiṣṇava literatures or purports and commentaries on *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* and the *Bhagavad-gītā.*

### Purport

In the *Padma Purāṇa,* the characteristics of the *guru,* the bona fide spiritual master, have been described:

*mahā-bhāgavata-śreṣṭho* *brāhmaṇo vai gurur nṛṇām  
sarveṣām eva lokānām* *asau pūjyo yathā hariḥ*

*mahā-kula-prasūto ’pi* *sarva-yajñeṣu dīkṣitaḥ  
sahasra-śākhādhyāyī ca* *na guruḥ syād avaiṣṇavaḥ*

The *guru* must be situated on the topmost platform of devotional service. There are three classes of devotees, and the *guru* must be accepted from the topmost class. The first-class devotee is the spiritual master for all kinds of people. It is said, *gurur nṛṇām.* The word *nṛṇām* means “of all human beings.” The *guru* is not limited to a particular group. It is stated in the *Upadeśāmṛta* of Rūpa Gosvāmī that a *guru* is a *gosvāmī,* a controller of the senses and the mind. Such a *guru* can accept disciples from all over the world. *Pṛthivīṁ sa śiṣyāt.* This is the test of the *guru.*

In India there are many so-called *gurus,* and they are limited to a certain district or a province. They do not even travel about India, yet they declare themselves to be *jagad-guru,* the *guru* of the whole world. Such cheating *gurus* should not be accepted. Anyone can see how the bona fide spiritual master accepts disciples from all over the world. The *guru* is a qualified *brāhmaṇa;* therefore he knows Brahman and Parabrahman. He thus devotes his life for the service of Parabrahman. The bona fide spiritual master who accepts disciples from all over the world is also worshiped all over the world because of his qualities. *Lokānām asau pūjyo yathā hariḥ:* the people of the world worship him just as they worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead. All these honors are offered to him because he strictly follows the brahminical principles and teaches these principles to his disciples. Such a person is called an *ācārya* because he knows the principles of devotional service, he behaves in that way himself, and he teaches his disciples to follow in his footsteps. Thus he is an *ācārya* or *jagad-guru.* Even though a person is born in a brahminical family and is very expert in performing sacrifices, he cannot be accepted as a *guru* if he is not a strict Vaiṣṇava. A *guru* is a *brāhmaṇa* by qualification, and he can turn others into *brāhmaṇas* according to the śāstric principles and brahminical qualifications. Brahmanism is not a question of heredity. In *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (7.11.35) Śrī Nārada Muni tells Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira what a *brāhmaṇa* is. He states that if brahminical qualifications are observed in *kṣatriyas, vaiśyas* or even *śūdras,* one should accept them as *brāhmaṇas.* In this regard, Śrīla Śrīdhara Svāmī has commented: *śamādibhir eva brāhmaṇādi-vyavahāro mukhyaḥ, na jāti-mātrādīty āha — yasyeti. yad yadi anyatra varṇāntare ’pi dṛśyeta, tad-varṇāntaraṁ tenaiva lakṣaṇa-nimittenaiva varṇena vinirdiśet, na tu jāti-nimittenety arthaḥ:* “The most important criterion for deciding whether to deal with someone as a *brāhmaṇa* or as a member of another *varṇa* is the presence or absence of self-control and similar brahminical qualities. We should not judge primarily according to superficial characteristics like birth. This is stated in the verse beginning *yasya* \[*Bhāg.* 7.11.35\]. If the qualities of one *varṇa* are seen in someone born in another*,* he should be designated according to the *varṇa* of his qualities, not that of his birth.”

There is a similar statement made by Nīlakaṇṭha, a commentator on the *Mahābhārata: śūdro ’pi śamādy-upeto brāhmaṇa eva brāhmaṇo ’pi kāmādy-upetaḥ śūdra eva.* “Although one may be born in a *śūdra* family, if he is endowed with the brahminical qualities, beginning with *śama* \control of the mind\], he is to be accepted as a *brāhmaṇa.* Although one may be born in a *brāhmaṇa* family, if he is endowed with the qualities beginning with *kāma* \[lust\], he is to be considered a *śūdra.*” No one should present himself as a *brāhmaṇa* simply on the basis of being born in a brahminical family. One must be qualified by the brahminical qualities mentioned in the *śāstras,* particularly the [*Bhagavad-gītā* (18.42):

*śamo damas tapaḥ śaucaṁ* *kṣāntir ārjavam eva ca  
jñānaṁ vijñānam āstikyaṁ* *brahma-karma svabhāva-jam*

“Peacefulness, self-control, austerity, purity, tolerance, honesty, knowledge, wisdom and religiousness — these are the natural qualities by which the *brāhmaṇas* work.”

Unless one is qualified with all these attributes, he cannot be accepted as a *brāhmaṇa.* It is not a question of simply taking birth in a *brāhmaṇa* family. In this regard, Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura remarks that Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura and Śyāmānanda Gosvāmī, although not born in *brāhmaṇa* families, are accepted as bona fide spiritual masters because they were *brāhmaṇas* by qualification. Personalities like Śrī Gaṅgā-nārāyaṇa, Rāmakṛṣṇa and many others, who were actually born in *brāhmaṇa* families, accepted Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura and Śyāmānanda Gosvāmī as their spiritual masters.

The *mahā-bhāgavata* is one who decorates his body with *tilaka* and whose name indicates him to be a servant of Kṛṣṇa by the word *dāsa.* He is also initiated by a bona fide spiritual master and is expert in worshiping the Deity, chanting *mantras* correctly, performing sacrifices, offering prayers to the Lord and performing *saṅkīrtana.* He knows how to serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead and how to respect a Vaiṣṇava. When one has attained the topmost position of *mahā-bhāgavata,* he is to be accepted as a *guru* and worshiped exactly like Hari, the Personality of Godhead. Only such a person is eligible to occupy the post of a *guru.* However, if one is highly qualified but is not a Vaiṣṇava, he cannot be accepted as a *guru.* One cannot be a *brāhmaṇa* unless one is a Vaiṣṇava. If one is a Vaiṣṇava, he is already a *brāhmaṇa.* If a *guru* is completely qualified as a Vaiṣṇava, he must be accepted as a *brāhmaṇa* even if he is not born in a *brāhmaṇa* family. The caste system method of distinguishing a *brāhmaṇa* by birth is not acceptable when applied to a bona fide spiritual master. A spiritual master is a qualified *brāhmaṇa* and *ācārya.* If one is not a qualified *brāhmaṇa,* he is not expert in studying the Vedic literatures. *Nānā-śāstra-vicāraṇaika-nipuṇau.* Every Vaiṣṇava is a spiritual master, and a spiritual master is automatically expert in brahminical behavior. He also understands the Vedic *śāstras.*

Similarly, a disciple’s qualifications must be observed by the spiritual master before he is accepted as a disciple. In our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, the requirement is that one must be prepared to give up the four pillars of sinful life — illicit sex, meat-eating, intoxication and gambling. In Western countries especially, we first observe whether a potential disciple is prepared to follow the regulative principles. Then he is given the name of a Vaiṣṇava servant and initiated to chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra,* at least sixteen rounds daily. In this way the disciple renders devotional service under the guidance of the spiritual master or his representative for at least six months to a year. He is then recommended for a second initiation, during which a sacred thread is offered and the disciple is accepted as a bona fide *brāhmaṇa.* Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura introduced the system of giving the sacred thread to a bona fide Vaiṣṇava, and we are following in his footsteps. The qualifications of a bona fide disciple are described in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (11.10.6) as follows:

*amānya-matsaro dakṣo* *nirmamo dṛḍha-sauhṛdaḥ  
asatvaro ’rtha-jijñāsur* *anasūyur amogha-vāk*

The disciple must have the following qualifications. He must give up interest in the material bodily conception. He must give up material lust, anger, greed, illusion, madness and envy. He should be interested only in understanding the science of God, and he should be ready to consider all points in this matter. He should no longer think, “I am this body,” or, “This thing belongs to me.” One must love the spiritual master with unflinching faith, and one must be very steady and fixed. The bona fide disciple should be inquisitive to understand transcendental subject matter. He must not search out faults among good qualities, and he should no longer be interested in material topics. His only interest should be Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

As far as the mutual testing of the spiritual master and disciple is concerned, Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura explains that a bona fide disciple must be very inquisitive to understand the transcendental subject matter. As stated in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (11.3.21):

*tasmād guruṁ prapadyeta* *jijñāsuḥ śreya uttamam*

“One who is inquisitive to understand the highest goal and benefit of life must approach a bona fide spiritual master and surrender unto him.” A serious disciple must be alert when selecting a bona fide spiritual master. He must be sure that the spiritual master can deliver all the transcendental necessities. The spiritual master must observe how inquisitive the disciple is and how eager he is to understand the transcendental subject matter. The spiritual master should study the disciple’s inquisitiveness for no less than six months or a year. A spiritual master should not be very anxious to accept a disciple because of his material opulences. Sometimes a big businessman or landlord may approach a spiritual master for initiation. Those who are materially interested are called *viṣayīs* (*karmīs*), which indicates that they are very fond of sense gratification. Such *viṣayīs* sometimes approach a famous *guru* and ask to become a disciple just as a matter of fashion. Sometimes *viṣayīs* pose as disciples of a reputed spiritual master just to cover their activities and advertise themselves as advanced in spiritual knowledge. In other words, they want to attain material success. A spiritual master must be very careful in this regard. Such business is going on all over the world. The spiritual master does not accept a materially opulent disciple just to advertise the fact that he has such a big disciple. He knows that by associating with such *viṣayī* disciples, he may fall down. One who accepts a *viṣayī* disciple is not a bona fide spiritual master. Even if he is, his position may be damaged due to association with an unscrupulous *viṣayī.* If a so-called spiritual master accepts a disciple for his personal benefit or for material gain, the relationship between the spiritual master and the disciple turns into a material affair, and the spiritual master becomes like a *smārta-guru.* There are many caste *gosvāmīs* who professionally create some disciples who do not care for them or their instructions. Such spiritual masters are satisfied simply to get some material benefits from their disciples. Such a relationship is condemned by Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura, who calls such spiritual masters and disciples a society of cheaters and cheated. They are also called *bāulas* or *prākṛta-sahajiyās.* Their aim is to make the connection between the spiritual master and the disciple into a very cheap thing. They are not serious in wanting to understand spiritual life.

The words *sevya bhagavān* in this verse of the *Caitanya-caritāmṛta* are important. *Bhagavān* indicates the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Viṣṇu. Lord Viṣṇu alone is worshipable. There is no need to worship demigods. This is confirmed in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (7.20):

*kāmais tais tair hṛta-jñānāḥ* *prapadyante ’nya-devatāḥ  
taṁ taṁ niyamam āsthāya* *prakṛtyā niyatāḥ svayā*

“Those whose intelligence has been stolen by material desires surrender unto demigods and follow the particular rules and regulations of worship according to their own natures.”

It is also stated in the *Skanda Purāṇa:*

*vāsudevaṁ parityajya* *yo ’nya-devam upāsate  
sva-mātaraṁ parityajya* *śva-pacīṁ vandate hi saḥ*

“A person who worships the demigods and gives up Lord Vāsudeva is like a man who gives up the protection of his mother for the shelter of a witch.”

It is also stated by Lord Kṛṣṇa in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (9.23):

*ye ’py anya-devatā-bhaktā* *yajante śraddhayānvitāḥ  
te ’pi mām eva kaunteya* *yajanty avidhi-pūrvakam*

“Those who are devotees of other gods and who worship them with faith actually worship only Me, O son of Kuntī, but they do so in a wrong way.”

Demigods are also living entities and parts and parcels of Kṛṣṇa. Therefore in one sense one worships Kṛṣṇa when one worships the demigods, but not in the proper way. There is a proper method to water a tree: one should water the root. But if one waters the leaves and branches instead, he is simply wasting his time. If one worships the demigods to the exclusion of Lord Viṣṇu, his rewards will only be material. As confirmed by Lord Kṛṣṇa in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (7.23):

*anta-vat tu phalaṁ teṣāṁ* *tad bhavaty alpa-medhasām  
devān deva-yajo yānti* *mad-bhaktā yānti mām api*

“Men of small intelligence worship the demigods, and their fruits are limited and temporary. Those who worship the demigods go to the planets of the demigods, but My devotees ultimately reach My supreme planet.”

Demigod worship is meant for unintelligent men because the benefits derived from demigod worship are all material, temporary and retractable. It is also stated in the *Padma Purāṇa:*

*yas tu nārāyaṇaṁ devaṁ* *brahma-rudrādi-daivataiḥ  
samatvenaiva vīkṣeta* *sa pāṣaṇḍī bhaved dhruvam*

“Whoever thinks Lord Viṣṇu and the demigods are on the same level is to be immediately considered a rogue as far as spiritual understanding is concerned.”

There are three modes of nature in the material world, but when one is situated spiritually, he is above the material modes, even though he lives in this material world. As Lord Kṛṣṇa states in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (14.26):

*māṁ ca yo ’vyabhicāreṇa* *bhakti-yogena sevate  
sa guṇān samatītyaitān* *brahma-bhūyāya kalpate*

“One who engages in full devotional service, unfailing in all circumstances, at once transcends the modes of material nature and thus comes to the level of Brahman.” In material consciousness, however, even one who is situated in the mode of goodness is susceptible to pollution by the modes of passion and ignorance. When the mode of goodness is mixed with the mode of passion, one worships the sun-god, Vivasvān. When the mode of goodness is mixed with the mode of ignorance, one worships Gaṇapati, or Gaṇeśa. When the mode of passion is mixed with the mode of ignorance, one worships Durgā, or Kālī, the external potency. When one is simply in the mode of ignorance, one becomes a devotee of Lord Śiva because Lord Śiva is the predominating deity of the mode of ignorance within this material world. However, when one is completely free from the influence of all the modes of material nature, one becomes a pure Vaiṣṇava on the devotional platform. As Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī states in the *Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu:*

*anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyaṁ* *jñāna-karmādy-anāvṛtam  
ānukūlyena kṛṣṇānu-* *śīlanaṁ bhaktir uttamā*

“One should render transcendental loving service to the Supreme Lord Kṛṣṇa favorably and without desire for material profit or gain through fruitive activities or philosophical speculation. That is called pure devotional service.”

The position of *viśuddha-sattva* is the position of uncontaminated goodness. On that platform one can then understand, *ārādhyo bhagavān vrajeśa-tanayas tad-dhāma vṛndāvanam:* “The Supreme Personality of Godhead, the son of Nanda Mahārāja, is to be worshiped along with His transcendental abode, Vṛndāvana.”

The word *sarva-mantra-vicāraṇa* in the present verse of *Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta* means “considering all different types of *mantras.*” There are different kinds of *mantras* for different kinds of devotees. There is the *mantra* known as the *dvādaśākṣara mantra,* composed of twelve syllables, and there is the *mantra* composed of eighteen syllables. Similarly, there are the Nārasiṁha *mantra,* the Rāma *mantra,* the Gopāla *mantra* and so on. Each and every *mantra* has its own spiritual significance. The spiritual master has to select a *mantra* for his disciple according to the disciple’s ability to chant different *mantras.*

### Translation

**“You should discuss the qualifications necessary for receiving a mantra, the perfection of the mantra, the purification of the mantra, initiation, morning duties, remembrance of the Supreme Lord, cleanliness and washing the mouth and other parts of the body.**

### Purport

The following injunction is given in the *Hari-bhakti-vilāsa* (1.194) regarding *mantra-adhikārī,* the qualification for receiving *mantra* initiation:

*tāntrikeṣu ca mantreṣu* *dīkṣāyāṁ yoṣitām api  
sādhvīnām adhikāro ’sti* *śūdrādīnāṁ ca sad-dhiyām*

“*Śūdras* and women who are chaste and sincerely interested in understanding the Absolute Truth are qualified to be initiated with the *pāñcarātrika-mantras.*” This is confirmed by Lord Kṛṣṇa in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (9.32):

*māṁ hi pārtha vyapāśritya* *ye ’pi syuḥ pāpa-yonayaḥ  
striyo vaiśyās tathā śūdrās* *te ’pi yānti parāṁ gatiṁ*

“O son of Pṛthā, those who take shelter in Me, though they be of lower birth — women, *vaiśyas* \[merchants\] and *śūdras* \[workers\] — can attain the supreme destination.”

If one actually wants to serve Kṛṣṇa, it doesn’t matter whether one is a *śūdra, vaiśya* or even a woman. If one is sincerely eager to chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra* or *dīkṣā-mantra,* one is qualified to be initiated according to the *pāñcarātrika* process. However, according to Vedic principles, only a *brāhmaṇa* who is fully engaged in his occupational duties can be initiated. *Śūdras* and women are not admitted to a *vaidika* initiation. Unless one is fit according to the estimation of the spiritual master, one cannot accept a *mantra* from the *pāñcarātrika-vidhi* or the *vaidika-vidhi.* When one is fit to accept the *mantra,* one is initiated by the *pāñcarātrika-vidhi* or the *vaidika-vidhi.* In any case, the result is the same.

Regarding *mantra-siddhy-ādi-śodhana,* the efficacy of the *mantra,* Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura gives sixteen divisions, which are confirmed in the *Hari-bhakti-vilāsa* (beginning with 1.204):

*siddha-sādhya-susiddhāri-* *kramāj jñeyo vicakṣaṇaiḥ*

These are (1) *siddha,* (2) *sādhya,* (3) *susiddha* and (4) *ari.* These four principles can be divided further: (1) *siddha-siddha,* (2) *siddha-sādhya,* (3) *siddha-susiddha,* (4) *siddha-ari,* (5) *sādhya-siddha,* (6) *sādhya-sādhya,* (7) *sādhya-susiddha,* (8) *sādhya-ari,* (9) *susiddha-siddha,* (10) *susiddha-sādhya,* (11) *susiddha-susiddha,* (12) *susiddha-ari,* (13) *ari-siddha,* (14) *ari-sādhya,* (15) *ari-susiddha,* and (16) *ari-ari.*

Those who are initiated with the eighteen-syllable *mantra* do not need to consider the above-mentioned sixteen divisions. As enjoined in the *Hari-bhakti-vilāsa* (1.215, 219, 220):

*na cātra śātravā doṣā* *narṇasvādi-vicāraṇā  
ṛkṣa-rāśi-vicāro vā* *na kartavyo manau priye*

*nātra cintyo ’ri-śuddhyādir* *nāri-mitrādi-lakṣaṇam*

*siddha-sādhya-susiddhāri-* *rūpā nātra vicāraṇā*

There is *śodhana,* or purification of the *mantra,* but there is no such consideration for the Kṛṣṇa *mantra. Balitvāt kṛṣṇa-mantrāṇāṁ saṁskārāpekṣaṇaṁ na hi:* “The Kṛṣṇa *mantra* is so strong that there is no question of *śodhana.*” (*Hari-bhakti-vilāsa* 1.235)

As far as *dīkṣā* is concerned, one should consult *Madhya-līlā* 15.108. On the whole, when a person is initiated according to the *pāñcarātrika-vidhi,* he has already attained the position of a *brāhmaṇa.* This is enjoined in the *Hari-bhakti-vilāsa* (2.12):

*yathā kāñcanatāṁ yāti* *kāṁsyaṁ rasa-vidhānataḥ  
tathā dīkṣā-vidhānena* *dvijatvaṁ jāyate nṛṇām*

“As bell metal can be turned into gold when treated with mercury, a disciple initiated by a bona fide *guru* immediately attains the position of a *brāhmaṇa*.”

As far as the time of *dīkṣā* (initiation) is concerned, everything depends on the position of the *guru.* As soon as a bona fide *guru* is received by chance or by a program, one should immediately take the opportunity to receive initiation. In the book called *Tattva-sāgara,* it is stated:

*durlabhe sad-gurūṇāṁ ca* *sakṛt-saṅga upasthite  
tad-anujñā yadā labdhā* *sa dīkṣāvasaro mahān*

*grāme vā yadi vāraṇye* *kṣetre vā divase niśi  
āgacchati gurur daivād* *yathā dīkṣā tad-ājñayā*

*yadaivecchā tadā dīkṣā* *guror ājñānurūpataḥ  
na tīrthaṁ na vrataṁ hemo* *na snānaṁ na japa-kriyā*

*dīkṣāyāḥ karaṇaṁ kintu* *svecchā-prāpte tu sad-gurau*

“If by chance one gets a *sad-guru,* it doesn’t matter whether one is in the temple or the forest. If the *sad-guru,* the bona fide spiritual master, agrees, one can be initiated immediately, without waiting for a suitable time or place.”

Concerning *prātaḥ-smṛti,* remembrance of the Lord in the morning, in the early morning hours (known as *brāhma-muhūrta*) one should get up and immediately chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra,* or at least “Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa.” In this way, one should remember Kṛṣṇa. Some *ślokas* or prayers should also be chanted. By chanting, one immediately becomes auspicious and transcendental to the infection of material qualities. Actually one has to chant and remember Lord Kṛṣṇa twenty-four hours daily, or as much as possible:

*smartavyaḥ satataṁ viṣṇur* *vismartavyo na jātucit  
sarve vidhi-niṣedhāḥ syur* *etayor eva kiṅkarāḥ*

“Kṛṣṇa is the origin of Lord Viṣṇu. He should always be remembered and never forgotten at any time. All the rules and prohibitions mentioned in the *śāstras* should be the servants of these two principles.” This is a quotation from the *Padma Purāṇa,* from the portion called *Bṛhat-sahasra-nāma-stotra.*

The word *prātaḥ-kṛtya* in the present verse of the *Caitanya-caritāmṛta* means that one should evacuate regularly in the morning and then cleanse himself by taking a bath. One has to gargle (*ācamana*) and brush his teeth (*danta-dhāvana*). He should do this either with twigs or a toothbrush — whatever is available. This will purify the mouth. Then one should take his bath. Actually householders and *vānaprasthas* should bathe two times a day (*prātar-madhyāhnayoḥ snānaṁ vānaprastha-gṛhasthayoḥ*). A *sannyāsī* should bathe three times daily, and a *brahmacārī* may take only one bath a day. Whenever one is not able to bathe in water, he can bathe by chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra.* One also has to perform his *sandhyādi-vandana* — that is, one has to chant his Gāyatrī *mantra* three times daily — morning, noon and evening.

**“Also describe Deity worship, wherein one should offer food to Kṛṣṇa at least five times daily and in due time place Him on a bed. You should also describe the process for offering ārati and the worship of the Lord according to the list of five, sixteen or fifty ingredients.**

### Purport

The five ingredients for Deity worship are (1) very good scents, (2) very good flowers, (3) incense, (4) a lamp and (5) something edible. As for *ṣoḍaśopacāra,* the sixteen ingredients, one should (1) provide a sitting place (*āsana*), (2) ask Kṛṣṇa to sit down, (3) offer *arghya,* (4) offer water to wash the legs, (5) wash the mouth, (6) offer *madhu-parka,* (7) offer water for washing the mouth, (8) bathe the Lord, (9) offer garments, (10) decorate the Lord’s body with ornaments, (11) offer sweet scents, (12) offer flowers with good fragrance, like the rose or *campaka,* (13) offer incense, (14) offer a lamp, (15) give good food, and (16) offer prayers.

In the *Hari-bhakti-vilāsa* (eleventh *vilāsa,* verses 127-140) there is a vivid description of what is required in Deity worship. There are sixty-four items mentioned. In the temple, worship should be so gorgeous that all sixty-four items should be available for the satisfaction of the Personality of Godhead. Sometimes it is impossible to get all sixty-four items; therefore we recommend that at least on the first day of installation all sixty-four items should be available. When the Lord is established, worship with all sixty-four items should continue as far as possible. The sixty-four items are as follows: (1) There must be a big bell hanging in front of the temple room so that whoever comes into the room can ring the bell. This item is called *prabodhana,* or offering oneself submissively to the Lord. This is the first item. (2) The visitor must chant “Jaya Śrī Rādhā-Govinda!” or “Jaya Śrī Rādhā-Mādhava!” when he rings the bell. In either case, the word *jaya* must be uttered. (3) One should immediately offer obeisances to the Lord, falling down like a stick. (4) There must be regular *maṅgala-ārati* in the temple during the early morning, an hour and a half before the sun rises. (5) There must be an *āsana,* a sitting place before the altar. This *āsana* is for the spiritual master. The disciple brings everything before the spiritual master, and the spiritual master offers everything to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. (6) After *maṅgala-ārati,* the Deity is supposed to wash His teeth by using a twig; therefore a twig must be offered. (7) Water must be offered for washing the Deity’s feet. (8) *Arghya* should be offered. (9) Water for *ācamana* should be offered. (10) *Madhu-parka,* a small bowl containing *madhu* (honey, a little ghee, a little water, a little sugar, yogurt and milk) should be offered. This is called *madhu-parka-ācamana.* (11) One should place wooden slippers before the Lord. (12) One should massage the body of the Lord. (13) One should massage the body of the Lord with oil. (14) With a soft, wet sponge one should remove all the oil smeared over the Lord’s body. (15) One should bathe the Lord with water in which nicely scented flowers have been soaking for some time. (16) After bathing the body of the Lord with water, one should bathe Him with milk. (17) Then one should bathe Him with yogurt. (18) Then one should bathe Him with ghee. (19) Then one should bathe Him with honey. (20) Then one should bathe Him with water in which sugar has been dissolved. (21) Then one should wash the Deity with water and chant this *mantra:*

*cintāmaṇi-prakara-sadmasu kalpa-vṛkṣa- *
 *lakṣāvṛteṣu surabhīr abhipālayantam  
lakṣmī-sahasra-śata-sambhrama-sevyamānaṁ *
 *govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi*

\(22\) One should dry the entire body of the Lord with a towel. (23) A new dress should be put on the Lord’s body. (24) A sacred thread should be placed on His body. (25) Water should be offered for cleansing His mouth (*ācamana*). (26) Nicely scented oils like liquid sandalwood pulp should be smeared over the Lord’s body. (27) All kinds of ornaments and crowns should be placed on His body. (28) Then one should offer flower garlands and decorative flowers. (29) One should burn incense. (30) Lamps should be offered. (31) Precautions should always be taken so that demons and atheists cannot harm the body of the Lord. (32) Food offerings should be placed before the Lord. (33) Spices for chewing should be offered. (34) Betel nuts should be offered. (35) At the proper time, there should be arrangements so that the Lord may take rest in bed. (36) The Lord’s hair should be combed and decorated. (37) First-class garments should be offered. (38) A first-class helmet should be offered. (39) The garments should be scented. (40) There should be Kaustubha jewels and other ornaments offered. (41) A variety of flowers should be offered. (42) Another *maṅgala-ārati* should be offered. (43) A mirror should be offered. (44) The Lord should be carried on a nice palanquin to the altar. (45) The Lord should be seated on the throne. (46) Again water should be given for the washing of His feet. (47) Something again should be offered for eating. (48) Evening *ārati* should be offered*.* (49) The Lord should be fanned with a *cāmara* fan, and an umbrella should be placed over His head. (50) The Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra* and approved songs should be sung. (51) Musical instruments should be played. (52) One should dance before the Deity. (53) One should circumambulate the Deity. (54) One should again offer obeisances. (55) One should offer different types of prayers and hymns at the Lord’s lotus feet. (56) One should touch the lotus feet of the Lord with one’s head. This may not be possible for everyone, but at least the *pūjārī* should do this. (57) The flowers offered on the previous day should touch one’s head. (58) One should take the remnants of the Lord’s food. (59) One should sit before the Lord and think that he is massaging the Lord’s legs. (60) One should decorate the Lord’s bed with flowers before the Lord takes His rest. (61) One should offer one’s hand to the Lord. (62) One should take the Deity to His bed. (63) One should wash the feet of the Lord and then sit Him on the bed. (64) One should place the Lord on the bed and then massage His feet.

*Ārati* should be offered to the Deities five times daily — early in the morning before sunrise, later in the morning, at noon, in the evening and at night. This means that there should be worship and a change of dress and flowers. As far as the eatables are concerned, all items should be first-class preparations. There should be first-class rice, dhal, fruit, sweet rice, vegetables and a variety of foods to be sucked, drunk and chewed. All the eatables offered to the Deities should be extraordinarily excellent. In Europe and America there is presently no monetary scarcity. People are not poor, and if they follow these principles of Deity worship, they will advance in spiritual life. As far as placing the Deity in the bed is concerned, if the Deity is large and heavy, it is not possible to move Him daily. It is better that a small Deity, which is also worshiped, be taken to the bed. This *mantra* should be chanted: *āgaccha śayana-sthānaṁ priyābhiḥ saha keśava.* “O Keśava, kindly come to Your bed along with Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī.” (*Hari-bhakti-vilāsa* 11.40)

The Deity should be placed in bed with Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī, and this should be indicated by bringing the wooden slippers from the altar to the bedside. When the Deity is laid down, His legs should be massaged. Before laying the Deity down, a pot of milk and sugar should be offered to Him. After taking this thick milk, the Deity should lie down and should be offered betel nuts and spices to chew.

### Synonyms

### Translation

**“You should glorify the holy name and explain that one must carefully give up offenses when chanting the holy name. You should also describe the symptoms of a Vaiṣṇava and explain that one must give up or nullify all kinds of sevā-aparādha, offenses in Deity worship.**

### Purport

The devotee should always be very careful not to commit the ten offenses when chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra.* If a devotee very strictly follows the methods of Deity worship, he will naturally and quickly become a pure Vaiṣṇava. A pure Vaiṣṇava has unflinching faith in the Lord, and he does not deviate at all. He is always engaged in perfect Deity worship.

One should also note the specific offenses against Deity worship. These are mentioned in the *Skanda Purāṇa* (*Avantī-khaṇḍa*)*,* spoken by Vyāsadeva himself. One should liquidate all kinds of offenses.

The *śālagrāma-śilā* should be worshiped with *tulasī* where a sufficient quantity of *tulasī* leaves are available. Worship of *śālagrāma-śilā* should be introduced in all ISKCON temples. *Śālagrāma-śilā* is the form of the Lord’s mercy. To worship the Deity with the sixty-four items mentioned may be a difficult job, but the Lord has become so small that anyone in any temple can carefully handle Deity worship simply by performing the same activities with the *śālagrāma-śilā.*

There are thirty-two offenses to the Deity that should be avoided. (1) One should not enter the temple in a vehicle. Shoes and slippers should be removed before entering the temple. (2) One should offer obeisances as soon as he sees the Deity. (3) One should enter the temple after taking a bath. In other words, one should be very clean. (4) One should not offer obeisances to the Lord with one hand. (5) One should not circumambulate demigods before the Deities. (6) One should not spread his legs before the Deity. (7) One should not sit down before the Deity with his legs crossed, nor should one touch his legs with his hands. (8) One should not lie down before the Deity. (9) One should not eat before the Deity. (10) One should not speak lies before the Deity. (11) One should not speak very loudly before the Deity. (12) One should not talk nonsense before the Deity. (13) One should not cry before the Deity. (14) One should not deal with others before the Deity. (15) One should not utter harsh words before the Deity. (16) One should not cover himself with a blanket. (17) One should not talk enviously of others before the Deity. (18) One should not praise others before the Deity. (19) One should not use slang before the Deity. (20) One should not pass air before the Deity. (21) One should not neglect the sixty-four items of Deity worship. (22) One should not eat anything not offered to the Deity. (23) One should not neglect offering seasonal fruits as soon as they are available. (24) One should always offer fresh, untouched fruit to the Deity. (25) One should not sit with his back toward the Deity. (26) One should not offer obeisances to others before the Deity. (27) One should not sit near the Deity without taking the spiritual master’s permission. (28) One should not be proud to hear himself praised before the Deity. (29) One should not blaspheme the demigods. (30) One should not be unkind to others before the Deities. (31) One should observe all festivals in the temple. (32) One should not fight or quarrel before the Deity.

**“Śrīla Sanātana Gosvāmī, the elder brother of Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī, was a most important minister in the government of Hussain Shah, the ruler of Bengal, and he was considered a most brilliant gem in that assembly. He possessed all the opulences of a royal position, but he gave up everything just to accept the youthful goddess of renunciation. Although he externally appeared to be a mendicant who had renounced everything, he was filled with the pleasure of devotional service within his heart. Thus he can be compared to a deep lake covered with moss. He was the object of pleasure for all the devotees who knew the science of devotional service.**
