title = "02 The Ecstatic Manifestations of Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu"
+++
CHAPTER TWO

In the second chapter of the *Madhya-līlā,* the author describes the pastimes the Lord performed during the last twelve years of His life. Thus he has also described some of the pastimes of the *antya-līlā.* Why he has done so is very difficult for an ordinary person to understand. The author expects that reading the pastimes of the Lord will gradually help a person awaken his dormant love of Kṛṣṇa. Actually this *Caitanya-caritāmṛta* was compiled by the author during very old age. Fearing he might not be able to finish the book, he has included a synopsis of the *antya-līlā* here in the second chapter. Śrīla Kavirāja Gosvāmī has confirmed that the opinion of Svarūpa Dāmodara is authoritative in the matter of devotional service. Over and above this are the notes of Svarūpa Dāmodara, memorized by Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī, who also helped in the compilation of the *Caitanya-caritāmṛta.* After the disappearance of Svarūpa Dāmodara Gosvāmī, Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī went to Vṛndāvana. At that time the author, Śrīla Kavirāja Gosvāmī, met Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī, by whose mercy he also could memorize all the notes. In this way the author was able to complete this transcendental literature, *Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta.*

### Verse text

*vicchede ’smin prabhor antya-  
līlā-sūtrānuvarṇane  
gaurasya kṛṣṇa-viccheda-  
pralāpādy anuvarṇyate*

### Synonyms

*vicchede* — in the chapter; *asmin* — this; *prabhoḥ* — of the Lord; *antya*-*līlā* — of the last division of His pastimes; *sūtra* — of a synopsis; *anuvarṇane* — in the matter of description; *gaurasya* — of Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu; *kṛṣṇa*-*viccheda* — of separation from Kṛṣṇa; *pralāpa* — craziness; *ādi* — other subject matters; *anuvarṇyate* — is being described.

### Translation

**While relating in synopsis form the last division of the pastimes of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, in this chapter I shall describe the Lord’s transcendental ecstasy, which appears like madness due to His separation from Kṛṣṇa.**

### Purport

In this second chapter, the activities of Lord Caitanya that took place after the Lord accepted *sannyāsa* are generally described. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is specifically mentioned here as being *gaura,* or of fair complexion. Kṛṣṇa is generally known to be blackish, but when He is absorbed in the thought of the *gopīs,* who are all of fair complexion, Kṛṣṇa Himself also becomes fair. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu in particular felt separation from Kṛṣṇa very deeply, exactly like a lover who is dejected in separation from the beloved. Such feelings, which were expressed by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu for nearly twelve years at the end of His pastimes, are described in brief in this second chapter of *Madhya-līlā.*

Because of the winds of the sea, sometimes the sand would form dunes. Such sand dunes are called *caṭaka parvata.* Instead of seeing these sand dunes simply as hills of sand, the Lord would take them to be Govardhana Hill. Sometimes He would run toward these dunes at high speed, crying very loudly, expressing the state of mind exhibited by Rādhārāṇī. Thus Caitanya Mahāprabhu was absorbed in thoughts of Kṛṣṇa and His pastimes. His state of mind brought Him the atmosphere of Vṛndāvana and Govardhana Hill, and thus He enjoyed the transcendental bliss of separation and meeting.

### Purport

The ecstatic transformations of the body described in such exalted literatures as the *Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu* are practically not seen in this material world. However, these symptoms were perfectly present in the body of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. These symptoms are indicative of *mahābhāva,* or the highest ecstasy. Sometimes *sahajiyās* artificially imitate these symptoms, but experienced devotees reject such imitations immediately. The author admits herein that these symptoms are not to be found anywhere but in the body of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

No one can understand another’s difficulties. Our life is actually not under Our control, for youth will remain for two or three days and soon be finished. In this condition, O creator, what will be Our destination?’ ”**

### Purport

The moonlike face of Kṛṣṇa is the reservoir of nectarean songs and the abode of His flute. It is also the root of all bodily beauty. The *gopīs* think that if their eyes are not engaged in seeing the beautiful face of Kṛṣṇa, it would be better for them to be struck by a thunderbolt. For the *gopīs,* to see anything but Kṛṣṇa is uninteresting and, indeed, detestable. The *gopīs* are never pleased to see anything but Kṛṣṇa. The only solace for their eyes is the beautiful moonlike face of Kṛṣṇa, the worshipful object of all senses. When they cannot see the beautiful face of Kṛṣṇa, they actually see everything as vacant, and they desire to be struck by a thunderbolt. They do not find any reason to maintain their eyes when they are bereft of the beauty of Kṛṣṇa.

“Both by rising and setting, the sun decreases the duration of life of everyone except one who utilizes the time by discussing topics of the all-good Personality of Godhead. Do the trees not live? Do the bellows of the blacksmith not breathe? All around us, do the beasts not eat and discharge semen? Men who are like dogs, hogs, camels and asses praise those men who never listen to the transcendental pastimes of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the deliverer from evils. One who has not listened to the messages about the prowess and marvelous acts of the Personality of Godhead and has not sung or chanted loudly the worthy songs about the Lord should be considered to possess ears like the holes of snakes and a tongue like that of a frog. The upper portion of the body, though crowned with a silk turban, is only a heavy burden if not bowed down before the Personality of Godhead, who can award *mukti* \[freedom\]. And the hands, though decorated with glittering bangles, are like those of a dead man if not engaged in the service of the Personality of Godhead Hari. The eyes which do not look at the symbolic representations of the Personality of Godhead Viṣṇu \[His forms, names, qualities, etc.\] are like those printed on the plumes of a peacock, and the legs which do not move to the holy places \[where the Lord is remembered\] are considered to be like tree trunks. The person who has not at any time received upon his head the dust from the feet of a pure devotee of the Lord is certainly a dead body. And the person who has never experienced the flavor of the *tulasī* leaves from the lotus feet of the Lord is also a dead body, although breathing. Certainly that heart is steel-framed which, in spite of one’s chanting the holy name of the Lord with concentration, does not change and feel ecstasy, at which time tears fill the eyes and the hairs stand on end.”

### Purport

In the *Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu,* the word *dainya* (humility) is explained as follows: “When unhappiness, fearfulness and the sense of having offended combine, one feels condemned. This sense of condemnation is described as *dīnatā,* humility. When one is subjected to such humility, he feels physically inactive, he apologizes, and his consciousness is disturbed. His mind is also restless, and many other symptoms are visible.” The word *nirveda* is also explained in the *Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu:* “One may feel unhappiness and separation, as well as jealousy and lamentation, due to not discharging one’s duties. The despondency that results is called *nirveda.* When one is captured by this despondency, thoughts, tears, loss of bodily luster, humility and heavy breathing result.” *Viṣāda* is also explained in the *Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu:* “When one fails to achieve his desired goal of life and repents for all his offenses, there is a state of regret called *viṣāda.*” The symptoms of *avasāda* are also explained: “One hankers to revive his original condition and inquires how to do so. There are also deep thought, heavy breathing, crying and lamentation, as well as a changing of the bodily color and drying up of the tongue.”

In the *Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu* thirty-three such destructive symptoms are mentioned. They are expressed in words, in the eyebrows and in the eyes. These symptoms are called *vyabhicārī bhāva,* destructive ecstasy. If they continue, they are sometimes called *sañcārī,* or continued ecstasy.

### Purport

When Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu thus spoke in ecstasy, He saw two persons before Him. One was His secretary, Svarūpa Dāmodara, and the other was Rāya Rāmānanda.

### Purport

In this connection, Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura says that the lovable Supreme Lord is the supreme shelter. The Lord is the supreme subject, and the devotees are the object. The coming together of a subject and object is called *ālambana.* The object hears, and the subject plays the flute. That the object cannot see the moonlike face of Kṛṣṇa and has no eagerness to see Him is the sign of being without *ālambana.* Externally imagining such a thing simply satisfies one’s lusty desires, and thus one lives without purpose.

### Translation

**“Love for Lord Kṛṣṇa is very pure, just like the waters of the Ganges. That love is an ocean of nectar. That pure attachment to Kṛṣṇa does not conceal any spot, which would appear just like a spot of ink on a white cloth.**

### Purport

### Translation

**“Unalloyed love of Kṛṣṇa is like an ocean of happiness. If someone gets one drop of it, the whole world can drown in that drop. It is not befitting to express such love of Godhead, yet a madman must speak. But even though he speaks, no one believes him.”**

Such love of Godhead acts in two ways. The poisonous effects of love of Godhead defeat the severe and fresh poison of the serpent. Yet there is simultaneously transcendental bliss, which pours down and defeats the pride of nectar and diminishes its value. In other words, love of Kṛṣṇa is so powerful that it simultaneously defeats the poisonous effects of a snake, as well as the happiness derived from pouring nectar on one’s head. It is perceived as doubly effective, simultaneously poisonous and nectarean.’ ”**

### Translation

**Because of the various kinds of ecstasy, contradictory states of mind occurred, and this resulted in a great fight between different types of ecstasy. Anxiety, impotence, humility, anger and impatience were all like soldiers fighting, and the madness of love of Godhead was the cause.**

### Purport

In the *Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu* it is stated that when similar ecstasies from separate causes meet, they are called *svarūpa-sandhi.* When opposing elements meet, whether they arise from a common cause or different causes, their conjunction is called *bhinna-rūpasandhi,* the meeting of contradictory ecstasies. The simultaneous joining of different ecstasies — fear and happiness, regret and happiness — is called meeting (*sandhi*)*.* The word *śābalya* refers to different types of ecstatic symptoms combined together, like pride, despondency, humility, remembrance, doubt, impatience caused by insult, fear, disappointment, patience and eagerness. The friction that occurs when these combine is called *śābalya.* Similarly, when the desire to see the object is very prominent, or when one is unable to tolerate any delay in seeing the desired object, the incapability is called *autsukya,* or eagerness. If such eagerness is present, one’s mouth dries up and one becomes restless. One also becomes full of anxiety, and hard breathing and impatience are observed. Similarly, the lightness of heart caused by strong attachment and strong agitation of the mind is called impotence (*cāpalya*)*.* Failure of judgment, misuse of words, and obstinate activities devoid of anxiety are observed. Similarly, when one becomes too angry at the other party, offensive and abominable speech occurs, and this anger is called *roṣa.* When one becomes impatient due to being scolded or insulted, the resultant state of mind is called *amarṣa.* In this state of mind, one perspires, acquires a headache, fades in bodily color and experiences anxiety and an urge to search out the remedy. The bearing of a grudge, aversion and chastisement are all visible symptoms.

### Translation

**The symptoms of madness served as an impetus for remembering Kṛṣṇa. The mood of ecstasy awoke love, disdain, defamation by words, pride, honor and indirect prayer. Thus Śrī Kṛṣṇa was sometimes blasphemed and sometimes honored.**

### Purport

The word *unmāda* is explained in the *Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu* as extreme joy, misfortune and bewilderment in the heart due to separation. Symptoms of *unmāda* are laughing like a madman, dancing, singing, performing ineffectual activities, talking nonsense, running, shouting and sometimes working in contradictory ways. The word *praṇaya* is explained thus: When there is a possibility of receiving direct honor but it is avoided, that love is called *praṇaya.* Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī, in his *Ujjvala-nīlamaṇi,* explains the word *māna* thus: When the lover feels novel sweetness by exchanging hearty loving words but wishes to hide his feelings by crooked means, *māna* is experienced.

### Translation

**There were different transformations of the body of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu: being stunned, trembling, perspiring, fading away of color, weeping, and choking of the voice. In this way His whole body was pervaded by transcendental joy. As a result, sometimes Caitanya Mahāprabhu would laugh, sometimes cry, sometimes dance and sometimes sing. Sometimes He would get up and run here and there, and sometimes fall on the ground and lose consciousness.**

### Purport

In the *Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu,* eight kinds of transcendental changes taking place in the body are described. *Stambha,* being stunned, refers to the mind’s becoming transcendentally absorbed. In that state, the peaceful mind is placed on the life air, and different bodily transformations are manifest. These symptoms are visible in the body of an advanced devotee. When life becomes almost inactive, it is called “stunned.” The emotions resulting from this condition are joy, fear, astonishment, moroseness and anger. In this condition, the power of speech is lost and there is no movement in the hands and legs. Otherwise, being stunned is a mental condition. Many other symptoms are visible on the entire body in the beginning. These are very subtle, but gradually they become very apparent. When one cannot speak, naturally one’s active senses are arrested, and the knowledge-acquiring senses are rendered inoperative. *Kampa,* trembling of the body, is mentioned in the *Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu* as a result of a special kind of fear, anger and joy. This is called *vepathu,* or *kampa.* When the body begins to perspire because of joy, fear and anger combined, this is called *sveda. Vaivarṇya* is described as a change in the bodily color. It is caused by a combination of moroseness, anger and fear. When these emotions are experienced, the complexion turns pale and the body becomes lean and thin. *Aśru* is explained in the *Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu* as a combination of joy, anger and moroseness that causes water to flow from the eyes without effort. When there is joy and there are tears in the eyes, the temperature of the tears is cold, but when there is anger, the tears are hot. In both cases, the eyes are restless, the eyeballs are red and there is itching. These are all symptoms of *aśru.* When there is a combination of moroseness, astonishment, anger, joy and fear, there is a choking in the voice. This choking is called *gadgada.* Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu refers to *gadgada-ruddhayā girā,* or “a faltering voice.” In the *Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu, pulaka* is described as joy, encouragement and fear. When these combine, the hairs on the body stand on end, and this bodily state is called *pulaka.*

Consequently He got up and immediately made a tumultuous sound, very loudly declaring, “Now Kṛṣṇa, the great personality, is present.” In this way, because of Kṛṣṇa’s sweet qualities, Caitanya Mahāprabhu made different types of mistakes in His mind. Thus by reciting the following verse, He ascertained the presence of Lord Kṛṣṇa.**

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu enjoyed all these four mellows, and thus He remained obliged to His devotees.**

### Purport

Paramānanda Purī is said to have been Uddhava in Vṛndāvana. His affections with Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu were on the platform of paternal love. This was because Paramānanda Purī happened to be the Godbrother of the spiritual master of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Similarly, Rāmānanda Rāya, who is considered an incarnation of Arjuna and by some an incarnation of Viśākhādevī, enjoyed unalloyed fraternal love with the Lord. Unalloyed personal service was enjoyed by Govinda and others. In the presence of His most confidential devotees like Gadādhara Paṇḍita, Jagadānanda and Svarūpa Dāmodara, Caitanya Mahāprabhu enjoyed the ecstatic conditions of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī in Her conjugal relationship with Kṛṣṇa. Absorbed in these four transcendental mellows, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu resided in Jagannātha Purī, feeling very much obliged to His devotees.

What, then, is so astonishing about these symptoms’ being manifest in the body of the Supreme Personality of Godhead? In the ecstatic mood of conjugal love, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was on the highest platform; therefore, all the exuberant ecstasies were naturally visible in His body.**

### Purport

Līlāśuka is Bilvamaṅgala Ṭhākura Gosvāmī. He was a South Indian, a *brāhmaṇa,* and his former name was Śilhaṇa Miśra. When he was a householder, he became attracted to a prostitute named Cintāmaṇi, but eventually he took her advice and became renounced. Thus he wrote a book named *Śānti-śataka,* and later, by the mercy of Lord Kṛṣṇa and the Vaiṣṇavas, he became a great devotee. Thus he became famous as Bilvamaṅgala Ṭhākura Gosvāmī. On that elevated platform he wrote a book named *Kṛṣṇa-karṇāmṛta,* which is very famous amongst Vaiṣṇavas. Since he exhibited so many ecstatic symptoms, people used to call him Līlāśuka.

Thus He is the most munificent.**

### Purport

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s capital is the touchstone of love of Godhead, and consequently He is a great owner of that transcendental treasure. After making unlimited amounts of gold, the touchstone remains the same. Similarly, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, although distributing love of Godhead unlimitedly, still remained the supreme owner of this transcendental opulence. His devotees, who learned it from Him, also had to distribute it munificently all over the world. This Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, following in the footsteps of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and His confidential devotees, is also trying to distribute love of Godhead all over the world through the chanting of the holy names of the Lord — Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare.

*yadi* — if; *keha* — someone; *hena* — thus; *kaya* — says; *grantha* — this book; *kaila* — is made; *śloka*-*maya* — with various Sanskrit verses; *itara* — ordinary; *jane* — persons; *nāribe* *bujhite* — will not be able to understand; *prabhura* — of Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu; *yei* — whatever; *ācaraṇa* — activities; *sei* — that; *kari* — I do; *varṇana* — description; *sarva*-*citta* — all hearts; *nāri* — I am unable; *ārādhite* — to please.

### Translation

**If one says that Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta is full of Sanskrit verses and therefore not understandable by a common man, I reply that what I have described are the pastimes of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and that for me to satisfy everyone is not possible.**

### Purport

Śrīla Kavirāja Gosvāmī and one who follows in his footsteps do not have to cater to the public. Their business is simply to satisfy the previous *ācāryas* and describe the pastimes of the Lord. One who is able to understand can relish this exalted transcendental literature, which is actually not meant for ordinary persons like scholars and literary men. Generally, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s pastimes recorded in the *Caitanya-caritāmṛta* are studied in universities and scholastic circles from a literary and historical point of view, but actually *Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta* is not a subject matter for research workers or literary scholars. It is simply meant for those devotees who have dedicated their lives to the service of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

yadi haya rāgoddeśa,* *tāhāṅ haye āveśa,

### Synonyms

*nāhi* — there is not; *kāhāṅ* — anywhere; *sa*-*virodha* — opposing element; *nāhi* — there is not; *kāhāṅ* — anywhere; *anurodha* — acceptance of someone’s opinion; *sahaja* — simple; *vastu* — substance; *kari* — I do; *vivaraṇa* — description; *yadi* — if; *haya* — there is; *rāga*-*uddeśa* — someone’s attraction or obstruction; *tāhāṅ* — there; *haye* — becoming; *āveśa* — involved; *sahaja* — simple; *vastu* — substance; *nā* *yāya* — is not possible; *likhana* — the writing.

### Translation

**In this Caitanya-caritāmṛta there is no contradictory conclusion, nor is anyone else’s opinion accepted. I have written this book to describe the simple substance as I have heard it from superiors. If I become involved in someone’s likes and dislikes, I cannot possibly write the simple truth.**

### Purport

The simplest thing for human beings is to follow their predecessors. Judgment according to mundane senses is not a very easy process. Whatever is awakened by attachment to one’s predecessor is the way of devotional service as indicated by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. The author says, however, that he cannot consider the opinions of those who become attracted or repelled by such things, because one cannot write impartially in that way. In other words, the author is stating that he did not inject personal opinion in the *Caitanya-caritāmṛta.* He has simply described his spontaneous understanding from superiors. If he had been carried away by someone’s likes and dislikes, he could not have written of such a sublime subject matter in such an easy way. The actual facts are understandable to real devotees. When these facts are recorded, they are very congenial to the devotees, but one who is not a devotee cannot understand. Such is the subject matter for realization. Mundane scholarship and its concomitant attachments and detachments cannot arouse spontaneous love of Godhead. Such love cannot be described by a mundane scholar.

### Translation

**If one does not understand in the beginning but continues to hear again and again the wonderful effects of Lord Caitanya’s pastimes will bring love for Kṛṣṇa. Gradually one will come to understand the loving affairs between Kṛṣṇa and the gopīs and other associates of Vṛndāvana. Everyone is advised to continue to hear over and over again in order to greatly benefit.**

### Translation

**In reply to those critics who say that Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta is full of Sanskrit verses, it can be said that Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam is also full of Sanskrit verses, as are the commentaries on Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. Nonetheless, Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam can be understood by everyone, as well as by advanced devotees who study the Sanskrit commentaries. Why, then, will people not understand the Caitanya-caritāmṛta? There are only a few Sanskrit verses, and these have been explained in the Bengali vernacular. What is the difficulty in understanding?**

I have neither added to nor subtracted from their version.**

### Purport

According to Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura, there are three kinds of devotees, known as *bhajana-vijña* (experts in devotional service), *bhajana-śīla* (devotees engaged in devotional service) and *kṛṣṇa-nāme dīkṣita kṛṣṇa-nāma-kārī* (initiated devotees engaged in chanting). The author of *Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta* begs the mercy of all these devotees and asks them to be pleased with him. He says, “Let the neophyte devotees — the devotees who are very expert in arguing though they have no sense of advanced devotional service, who think themselves very advanced because they imitate some *smārta-brāhmaṇa* — let such devotees not be displeased with me, thinking that I have committed errors in this regard. I beg their pardon with great humility, but I am submitting that I personally have no desire to add or subtract anything. I have only written what I have heard in the disciplic succession because I am dedicated to the lotus feet of previous *ācāryas* like Svarūpa Dāmodara, Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī and Rūpa Gosvāmī. I have only written what I have learned from them.”
