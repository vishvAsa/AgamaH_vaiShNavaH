CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE

The following is a summary of chapter twenty-five. A Maharashtriyan *brāhmaṇa* who was living in Benares was a great devotee of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. He was always very happy to hear the glories of the Lord, and it was by his arrangement that all the *sannyāsīs* of Vārāṇasī became devotees of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. He invited all the *sannyāsīs* to his house to meet Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and this incident has been described in the seventh chapter of the *Ādi-līlā.* From that day, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu became famous in the city of Vārāṇasī, and many important men in that city became His followers. By and by, one of the disciples of the great *sannyāsī* Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī became devoted to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and this devotee explained Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu to Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī and supported His views with various arguments.

One day Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu went to take a bath at Pañcanada, and afterwards all His devotees began chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra* in front of the temple of Bindu Mādhava. At this time Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī and all his devotees approached the Lord. Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī immediately fell down at the lotus feet of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and very much regretted his past behavior toward the Lord. He asked Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu about devotional service in terms of the *Vedānta-sūtra,* and the Lord told him about devotional service that is approved by great personalities who know the *Vedānta-sūtra.* Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu then pointed out that *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* is the proper commentary on the *Vedānta-sūtra.* He then explained the *catuḥ-ślokī* (four *ślokas*) of *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,* the essence of that great scripture.

From that day on, all the *sannyāsīs* of Vārāṇasī became devotees of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Before returning to His headquarters at Jagannātha Purī, the Lord advised Sanātana Gosvāmī to go to Vṛndāvana. The Lord then departed for Jagannātha Purī. Kavirāja Gosvāmī then describes something about Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī, Sanātana Gosvāmī and Subuddhi Rāya. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu returned to Jagannātha Purī through the great forest of Jhārikhaṇḍa (Jharkhand) in central India. At the end of this chapter, Kavirāja Gosvāmī sums up the incidents of the *madhya-līlā* and instructs every living being to read this sublime book of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s pastimes.

### Purport

If one saw the personal characteristics and activities of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, one would certainly be convinced that He was the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One can ascertain this by following in the footsteps of the śāstric injunctions. This sincere study and appreciation of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is also applicable to His authorized devotees, and it is clearly stated in the *Caitanya-caritāmṛta* (*Antya-līlā* 7.11):

*kali-kālera dharma — kṛṣṇa-nāma-saṅkīrtana  
kṛṣṇa-śakti vinā nāhe tāra pravartana*

In this Age of Kali, real religious propaganda should induce people to chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra.* This is possible for someone who is especially empowered by Kṛṣṇa. No one can do this without being especially favored by Kṛṣṇa. Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura comments in this regard in his *Anubhāṣya,* wherein he quotes a verse from the *Nārāyaṇa-saṁhitā:*

*dvāparīyair janair viṣṇuḥ* *pañcarātrais tu kevalaiḥ  
kalau tu nāma-mātreṇa* *pūjyate bhagavān hariḥ*

“In Dvāpara-yuga, devotees of Lord Viṣṇu and Kṛṣṇa rendered devotional service according to the principles of *Pāñcarātra.* In this Age of Kali, the Supreme Personality of Godhead is worshiped simply by the chanting of His holy names.” Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura then comments, “Without being empowered by the direct potency of Lord Kṛṣṇa to fulfill His desire and without being specifically favored by the Lord, no human being can become the spiritual master of the whole world. He certainly cannot succeed by mental concoction, which is not meant for devotees or religious people. Only an empowered personality can distribute the holy name of the Lord and enjoin all fallen souls to worship Kṛṣṇa. By distributing the holy name of the Lord, he cleanses the hearts of the most fallen people; therefore he extinguishes the blazing fire of the material world. Not only that, he broadcasts the shining brightness of Kṛṣṇa’s effulgence throughout the world. Such an *ācārya,* or spiritual master, should be considered nondifferent from Kṛṣṇa — that is, he should be considered the incarnation of Lord Kṛṣṇa’s potency. Such a personality is *kṛṣṇāliṅgita-vigraha* — that is, he is always embraced by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa. Such a person is above the considerations of the *varṇāśrama* institution. He is the *guru,* or spiritual master, for the entire world, a devotee on the topmost platform, the *mahā-bhāgavata* stage, and a *paramahaṁsa-ṭhākura,* a spiritual form only fit to be addressed as *paramahaṁsa* or *ṭhākura.*”

Nonetheless, there are many people who are just like owls and never open their eyes to see the sunshine. These owlish personalities, who are inferior even to the Māyāvādī *sannyāsīs,* cannot see the brilliance of Kṛṣṇa’s favor upon the *mahā-bhāgavata* devotee. They are prepared to criticize the person engaged in distributing the holy name all over the world and following in the footsteps of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, who wanted Kṛṣṇa consciousness preached in every town and city.

### Purport

We have been spreading this *saṅkīrtana* movement in the Western countries, and in our recent tour of European cities like Rome, Geneva, Paris and Frankfurt, many learned Christian scholars, priests, philosophers and *yogīs* came to see us, and by the grace of Kṛṣṇa they agreed that the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, the *bhakti* cult, offers the topmost conclusion. Following in the footsteps of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, we are trying to convince everyone that the devotional service of the Lord is enjoined in every scripture. If a person is religious, he must accept the supreme authority of the Lord, become His devotee and try to love Him. This is the real principle of religion. It does not matter whether one is Christian, Muslim or whatever. He simply must accept the sublime position of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and render service unto Him. It is not a question of being Christian, Muslim or Hindu. One should be purely religious and freed from all these material designations. In this way one can learn the art of devotional service. This argument appeals to all intelligent men, and consequently the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is gaining ground throughout the world. Due to our solid logic and scientific presentation, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s prediction that Kṛṣṇa consciousness will spread to every town and village throughout the world is gradually being realized.

*‘brahma’-śabde kahe ‘ṣaḍ-aiśvarya-pūrṇa bhagavān’  
tāṅre ‘nirviśeṣa’ sthāpi, ‘pūrṇatā’ haya hāna*

### Synonyms

*brahma*-*śabde* — by the word *brahma*; *kahe* — is meant; *ṣaṭ*-*aiśvarya*-*pūrṇa* *bhagavān* — the Supreme Personality of Godhead, full in all six opulences; *tāṅre* — Him; *nirviśeṣa* *sthāpi* — if we make impersonal; *pūrṇatā* *haya* *hāna* — His completeness becomes damaged.

### Translation

**“The word ‘Brahman’ \[‘the greatest’\] indicates the Supreme Personality of Godhead, full in all six opulences. But if we take the onesided impersonalist view, His fullness is diminished.**

### Purport

The Supreme Personality of Godhead is originally the Supreme Person, and He expands Himself impersonally through His potency. As the Lord says in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (9.4):

*mayā tatam idaṁ sarvaṁ* *jagad avyakta-mūrtinā  
mat-sthāni sarva-bhūtāni* *na cāhaṁ teṣv avasthitaḥ*

“By Me, in My unmanifested form, this entire universe is pervaded. All beings are in Me, but I am not in them.” The potency of Kṛṣṇa that is spread everywhere is impersonal, just as the sunlight is the impersonal expansion of the sun globe and the sun-god. If we simply take one side of the Supreme Personality of Godhead — His impersonal effulgence — that one side does not fully explain the Absolute Truth. Impersonal appreciation of the Absolute Truth is one-sided and incomplete. One should also accept the other side, the personal side — Bhagavān. *Brahmeti paramātmeti bhagavān iti śabdyate.* One should not be satisfied simply by understanding the Brahman feature of the Personality of Godhead. One must also know the Lord’s personal feature. That is complete understanding of the Absolute Truth.

### Translation

**“The Vedas, the Upaniṣads, the Brahma-sūtra and the Purāṇas all describe the activities of the spiritual potency of the Lord. If one cannot accept the personal activities of the Lord, he jokes foolishly and gives an impersonal description.**

### Purport

In the Vedic literatures, including the *Purāṇas,* there are full descriptions of the spiritual potency of Kṛṣṇa. All the pastimes of the Lord are eternal, blissful and full of knowledge, just as the form of Kṛṣṇa Himself is eternal, blissful and full of knowledge (*sac-cid-ānanda-vigraha*)*.* Unintelligent people with a poor fund of knowledge compare their temporary bodies to the spiritual body of Kṛṣṇa, and by such foolishness they try to understand Kṛṣṇa as one of them. *Avajānanti māṁ mūḍhā mānuṣīṁ tanum āśritam.* The *Bhagavad-gītā* (9.11) points out that foolish people think of Kṛṣṇa as one of them. Not understanding His spiritual potency, they simply decry the personal form of the Absolute Truth, foolishly thinking of themselves as *jñānīs* cognizant of the complete truth. They cannot understand that just as the material energy of the Lord has a variety of activities, the spiritual energy has variety also. They consider activities in devotional service the same as activities in material consciousness. Under such a wrong impression, they sometimes dare joke about the spiritual activities of the Lord and His devotional service.

ei baḍa ‘pāpa’, — satya caitanyera vāṇī*

### Synonyms

*cit*-*ānanda* *kṛṣṇa*-*vigraha* — the transcendental form of Kṛṣṇa, which is completely spiritual; *māyika* *kari’* *māni* — accept as made of the external energy, *māyā*; *ei* *baḍa* *pāpa* — this is a great act of sin; *satya* — true; *caitanyera* *vāṇī* — the words of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

### Translation

**“The Māyāvādīs do not recognize the personal form of the Lord as spiritual and full of bliss. This is a great sin. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s statements are actually factual.**

### Purport

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s movement especially aims at defeating the Māyāvāda conclusion about the Absolute Truth. Since the members of the Māyāvāda school cannot understand the spiritual form of the Lord, they incorrectly think the Lord’s form is also made of material energy. They think that He is covered by a material body just like other living beings. Due to this offensive understanding, they cannot recognize that Śrī Kṛṣṇa’s personal form is transcendental, not material. Their conclusion is a great offense at the lotus feet of the Lord. As explained by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Śrī Kṛṣṇa has His eternal, blissful form that is full of knowledge, and all Vaiṣṇava *ācāryas* accept this. That is the proper understanding of the Absolute Truth.

### Translation

**“ ‘O supreme one, the transcendental form I am now seeing is full of transcendental bliss. It is not contaminated by the external energy. It is full of effulgence. My Lord, there is no better understanding of You than this. You are the Supreme Soul and the creator of this material world, but You are not connected with this material world. You are completely different from created form and variety. I sincerely take shelter of that form of Yours which I am now seeing. This form is the original source of all living beings and their senses.’**

### Purport

This is a quotation from *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (3.9.3). This verse was spoken by Lord Brahmā, who perfectly realized the Supreme Personality of Godhead after meditating upon the Lord within the water of the Garbhodaka Ocean. Brahmā realized that the form of the Lord is completely spiritual. This is certainly a better understanding of the Absolute Truth than the impersonal understanding.

### Translation

**“Śrīpāda Śaṅkarācārya has given his interpretation and imaginary meaning. It does not actually appeal to the mind of any sane man. He has done this to convince the atheists and bring them under his control.**

### Purport

Śrīpāda Śaṅkarācārya’s propaganda opposed the atheistic philosophy of Buddha. Lord Buddha’s intention was to stop atheists from committing the sin of killing animals. Atheists cannot understand God; therefore Lord Buddha appeared and spread the philosophy of nonviolence to keep the atheists from killing animals. Unless one is free from the sin of animal-killing, he cannot understand religion or God. Although Lord Buddha was an incarnation of Kṛṣṇa, he did not speak about God, for the people were unable to understand. He simply wanted to stop animal-killing. Śrīpāda Śaṅkarācārya wanted to establish the predominance of one’s spiritual identity; therefore he wanted to convert the atheists through an imaginary interpretation of the Vedic literatures. These are the secrets of the *ācāryas.* Sometimes they conceal the real purport of the *Vedas* and explain the *Vedas* in a different way. Sometimes they enunciate a different theory just to bring the atheists under their control. Thus it is said that Śaṅkara’s philosophy is for *pāṣaṇḍas,* atheists.

### Purport

In his *Amṛta-pravāha-bhāṣya,* Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura gives the following summary of the six philosophical processes. Prakāśānanda admitted that Śrīpāda Śaṅkarācārya, being very eager to establish his philosophy of monism, took shelter of the Vedānta philosophy and tried to explain it in his own way. The fact is, however, that if one accepts the existence of God, one certainly cannot establish the theory of monism. For this reason Śaṅkarācārya refuted all kinds of Vedic literature that establishes the supremacy of the Personality of Godhead. In various ways, Śaṅkarācārya has tried to refute the Vedic literature. Throughout the world, ninety-nine percent of the philosophers following in the footsteps of Śaṅkarācārya refuse to accept the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Instead they try to establish their own opinions. It is typical of mundane philosophers to want to establish their own opinions and refute those of others. Therefore: (1) The Mīmāṁsaka philosophers, following the principles of Jaimini, stress fruitive activity and say that if there is a God, He must be under the laws of fruitive activity. In other words, if one performs his duties very nicely in the material world, God is obliged to give one the desired result. According to these philosophers, there is no need to become a devotee of God. If one strictly follows moral principles, one will be recognized by the Lord, who will give the desired reward. Such philosophers do not accept the Vedic principle of *bhakti-yoga.* Instead, they give stress to following one’s prescribed duty. (2) Atheistic Sāṅkhya philosophers like Kapila analyze the material elements very scrutinizingly and thereby come to the conclusion that material nature is the cause of everything. They do not accept the Supreme Personality of Godhead as the cause of all causes. (3) Nyāya philosophers like Gautama and Kaṇāda have accepted a combination of atoms as the original cause of the creation. (4) Māyāvādī philosophers say that everything is an illusion. Headed by philosophers like Aṣṭāvakra, they stress the impersonal Brahman effulgence as the cause of everything. (5) Philosophers following the precepts of Patañjali practice *rāja-yoga.* They imagine a form of the Absolute Truth within many forms. That is their process of self-realization.

All five of these philosophies completely reject the predominance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and strive to establish their own philosophical theories. However, Śrīla Vyāsadeva wrote the *Vedānta-sūtra* and, taking the essence of all Vedic literature, established the supremacy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. All five kinds of philosophers mentioned above understand that impersonal Brahman is without material qualities, and they believe that when the Personality of Godhead appears, He is contaminated and covered by the material qualities. The technical term used is *saguṇa.* They speak of *saguṇa* Brahman and *nirguṇa* Brahman. For them, *nirguṇa* Brahman means “the impersonal Absolute Truth without any material qualities” and *saguṇa* Brahman means “the Absolute Truth that accepts the contamination of material qualities.” More or less, this kind of philosophical speculation is called Māyāvāda philosophy. The fact is, however, that the Absolute Truth never has anything to do with material qualities because He is transcendental. He is always complete with full spiritual qualities. The five philosophers mentioned above do not accept Lord Viṣṇu as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but they are very busy refuting the philosophies of other schools. There are six kinds of philosophical processes in India. Because Vyāsadeva is the Vedic authority, he is known as Vedavyāsa. His philosophical explanation of the *Vedānta-sūtra* is accepted by the devotees. As Kṛṣṇa confirms in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (15.15):

*sarvasya cāhaṁ hṛdi sanniviṣṭo *
 *mattaḥ smṛtir jñānam apohanaṁ ca  
vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyo *
 *vedānta-kṛd veda-vid eva cāham*

“I am seated in everyone’s heart, and from Me come remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness. By all the *Vedas,* I am to be known; indeed, I am the compiler of Vedānta, and I am the knower of the *Vedas.*”

The ultimate goal of studying all Vedic literature is the acceptance of Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is propagating the philosophical conclusion of Śrīla Vyāsadeva and following other great *ācāryas* like Rāmānujācārya, Madhvācārya, Viṣṇu Svāmī, Nimbārka and Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu Himself.

### Translation

**“ ‘Dry arguments are inconclusive. A great personality whose opinion does not differ from others is not considered a great sage. Simply by studying the Vedas, which are variegated, one cannot come to the right path by which religious principles are understood. The solid truth of religious principles is hidden in the heart of an unadulterated, self-realized person. Consequently, as the śāstras confirm, one should accept whatever progressive path the mahājanas advocate.’**

### Purport

This is a quotation from *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (10.34.9). The inhabitants of Vṛndāvana, under the leadership of Nanda Mahārāja, once went to the bank of the Sarasvatī on a pilgrimage. Nanda Mahārāja was fasting, and he lay down near the forest. At that time a serpent, who was formerly cursed by Āṅgirasa Ṛṣi, appeared. This serpent had formerly been named Sudarśana, and he had belonged to the Vidyādhara planet. However, because he joked with the *ṛṣi,* he was condemned to take on the body of a big snake. When this serpent attacked Nanda Mahārāja, Nanda Mahārāja began to call, “Kṛṣṇa! Help!” Kṛṣṇa immediately appeared and began to kick the serpent with His lotus feet. Due to being touched by the Lord’s lotus feet, the serpent was immediately freed from the reactions of his sinful life. Being freed, he again assumed his original form of Sudarśana, the Vidyādhara.

### Translation

**When Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī supported himself by quoting the verse from Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu immediately protested by uttering the holy name of Lord Viṣṇu. The Lord then presented Himself as a most fallen living entity, and He said, “If someone accepts a fallen conditioned soul as Viṣṇu, Bhagavān, or an incarnation, he commits a great offense.”**

### Purport

Although Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was Viṣṇu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, to teach us a lesson He nonetheless denied belonging to the Viṣṇu category. Unfortunately, there are many so-called Viṣṇu incarnations in this Age of Kali. People do not know that posing oneself as an incarnation is most offensive. People should not accept an ordinary man as an incarnation of God, for this also is a very great offense.

### Translation

**Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu replied, “I am an ordinary living being, and therefore My knowledge is very insignificant. However, the meaning of the Brahma-sūtra is very grave because its author, Vyāsadeva, is the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself.**

### Purport

An ordinary living being cannot actually understand the meaning of the *Vedānta-sūtra.* One can understand the meaning if he hears it from the authority, Vyāsadeva himself. For this purpose, Vyāsadeva gave a commentary on the *Brahma-sūtra* in the form of *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.* He had been instructed to do this by his spiritual master, Nārada. Of course, Śaṅkarācārya distorted the meaning of the *Brahma-sūtra* because he had a motive to serve. He wanted to establish Vedic knowledge in place of the atheistic knowledge spread by Lord Buddha. All these necessities are there according to time and circumstances. Neither Lord Buddha nor Śaṅkarācārya is to be blamed. The time required such an explanation for the understanding of various types of atheists. The conclusion is that one cannot understand the meaning of the *Vedānta-sūtra* without going through *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* and rendering devotional service. Caitanya Mahāprabhu therefore further explains the matter in the following verses.

### Purport

The sound vibration *oṁkāra* is the root of Vedic knowledge. *Oṁkāra* is known as the *mahā-vākya,* or supreme sound. Whatever meaning is in the supreme sound *oṁkāra* is further understood in the Gāyatrī *mantra.* Again, this same meaning is explained in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* in the four *ślokas* known as the *catuḥ-ślokī,* which begin with the words *ahaṁ evāsam evāgre.* The Lord says, “Only I existed before the creation.” From this statement, four *ślokas* have been composed, and these are known as the *catuḥ-ślokī.* In this way the Supreme Personality of Godhead informed Lord Brahmā about the purport of the *catuḥ-ślokī.* Again, Lord Brahmā explained this to Nārada Muni, and Nārada Muni explained it to Śrīla Vyāsadeva. This is the *paramparā* system, the disciplic succession. The import of Vedic knowledge, the original word *praṇava,* has been explained in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.* The conclusion is that the *Brahma-sūtra* is explained in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.*

### Purport

This is a quotation from *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (8.1.10). Communists and socialists are trying to propagate the philosophy that everything belongs to the mass of people or to the state. Such an idea is not perfect. When this idea is expanded, we can see that everything belongs to God. That will be the perfection of the communistic idea. The purpose of *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* is here very nicely explained. Every one of us must be satisfied with those things the Supreme Personality of Godhead has allotted us. We should not encroach upon the possessions of others. This simple idea can be expanded in our daily lives. Everyone should have a piece of land given by the government, and everyone should possess a few cows. Both of these should be utilized for one’s daily bread. Above that, if something is manufactured in a factory, it should be considered the property of the Supreme Personality of Godhead because the ingredients belong to the Supreme Lord. Actually, there is no need to manufacture such things artificially, but if it is done, one should consider that the goods produced belong to the Supreme Lord. Spiritual communism recognizes the supreme proprietorship of the Supreme Lord. As Lord Kṛṣṇa explains in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (5.29):

*bhoktāraṁ yajña-tapasāṁ* *sarva-loka-maheśvaram  
suhṛdaṁ sarva-bhūtānāṁ* *jñātvā māṁ śāntim ṛcchati*

“A person in full consciousness of Me, knowing Me to be the ultimate beneficiary of all sacrifices and austerities, the Supreme Lord of all planets and demigods, and the benefactor and well-wisher of all living entities, attains peace from the pangs of material miseries.”

It is further explained in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* that no one should claim anything as his property. Whatever property one claims to be his actually belongs to Kṛṣṇa. One should be satisfied with whatever has been allotted by the Supreme Lord and should not encroach upon the property of others. This will lead to peace in the whole world.

Spiritual knowledge means fully understanding the Absolute Truth in three features — impersonal Brahman, localized Paramātmā and the all-powerful Supreme Personality of Godhead. Ultimately when one takes shelter at the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and engages in the Lord’s service, the resultant knowledge is called *vijñāna,* special knowledge, or the practical application of spiritual knowledge. One should be engaged in the Lord’s devotional service to achieve the aim of life, called *prayojana.* The practice of devotional service to attain that goal of life is called *abhidheya.*

### Purport

Real spiritual knowledge has to be received from revealed scriptures. After this knowledge is attained, one can begin to perceive his actual spiritual life. Any knowledge achieved by speculation is imperfect. One must receive knowledge from the *paramparā* system and from the *guru;* otherwise one will be bewildered and will ultimately become an impersonalist. One who very scrutinizingly deliberates on genuine spiritual knowledge can realize the personal feature of the Absolute Truth. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is always transcendental to this material creation. *Nārāyaṇaḥ paro ’vyaktāt:* “Nārāyaṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is always transcendental.” He is not a creation of this material world. Without realizing spiritual knowledge, one cannot understand that the transcendental form of the Lord is always beyond the creative energy. The example of the sun and the sunshine is given. The sunshine is not the sun, but still the sunshine is not separate from the sun. The philosophy of *acintya-bhedābheda-tattva* (simultaneously one and different) cannot be understood by one who is fully under the influence of the external energy. Consequently a person under the influence of the material energy cannot understand the nature and form of the Personality of the Absolute Truth.

### Purport

The cult of *bhāgavata-dharma* can be spread in all circumstances, among all people and in all countries. Many envious people accuse the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement of spoiling the rigidity of so-called Hinduism. That is not actually the fact. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu confirms that devotional service to the Lord — the cult of *bhāgavata-dharma,* which is now being spread as the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement — can be spread in every country, to every person, in any condition of life, and in all circumstances. *Bhāgavata-dharma* does not restrict pure devotees to the Hindu community. A pure devotee is above a *brāhmaṇa;* therefore it is not incompatible to offer the sacred thread to devotees in Europe, America, Australia, Japan, Canada, and so on. Sometimes these pure devotees, who have been accepted by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, are not allowed to enter certain temples in India. Also, some high-caste *brāhmaṇas* and *gosvāmīs* refuse to take *prasādam* in the temples of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. Actually this is against the instruction of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Devotees can come from any country, and they can belong to any creed or race. On the strength of this verse, those who are actually devotees and followers of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu must accept devotees from all parts of the world as pure Vaiṣṇavas. They should be accepted not artificially but factually. One should see how they are advanced in Kṛṣṇa consciousness and how they are conducting Deity worship, *saṅkīrtana* and Ratha-yātrā. Considering all these points, the envious persons must henceforward refrain from their malicious atrocities.

### Verse text

*‘dharmādi’ viṣaye yaiche e ‘cāri’ vicāra  
sādhana-bhakti — ei cāri vicārera pāra*

### Synonyms

*dharma*-*ādi* — of religious activities and so on; *viṣaye* — in the subject matter; *yaiche* — just as; *e* *cāri* *vicāra* — there is a consideration of four principles, namely the person, country, time and atmosphere; *sādhana*-*bhakti* — of devotional service; *ei* — these; *cāri* — four; *vicārera* — to the considerations; *pāra* — transcendental.

### Translation

**“ ‘As far as religious principles are concerned, there is a consideration of the person, the country, the time and the circumstance. In devotional service, however, there are no such considerations. Devotional service is transcendental to all such considerations.**

### Purport

When we are on the material platform, there are different types of religions — Hinduism, Christianity, Islam, Buddhism and so on. These are instituted for a particular time, a particular country or a particular person. Consequently there are differences. Christian principles are different from Hindu principles, and Hindu principles are different from Muslim and Buddhist principles. These may be considered on the material platform, but when we come to the platform of transcendental devotional service, there are no such considerations. The transcendental service of the Lord (*sādhana-bhakti*) is above these principles. The world is anxious for religious unity, and that common platform can be achieved in transcendental devotional service. This is the verdict of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. When one becomes a Vaiṣṇava, he becomes transcendental to all these limited considerations. This is confirmed by Lord Kṛṣṇa in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (14.26):

*māṁ ca yo ’vyabhicāreṇa* *bhakti-yogena sevate  
sa guṇān samatītyaitān* *brahma-bhūyāya kalpate*

“One who engages in full devotional service, unfailing in all circumstances, at once transcends the modes of material nature and thus comes to the level of Brahman.”

The devotional activities of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement are completely transcendental to material considerations. As far as different faiths are concerned, religions may be of different types, but on the spiritual platform, everyone has an equal right to execute devotional service. That is the platform of oneness and the basis for a classless society. In his *Amṛta-pravāha-bhāṣya,* Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura confirms that one has to learn from a bona fide spiritual master about religious principles, economic development, sense gratification and ultimately liberation. These are the four divisions of regulated life, but they are on the material platform. On the spiritual platform, the four principles are *jñāna, vijñāna, tad-aṅga* and *tad-rahasya.* Rules, regulations and restrictions are on the material platform, but on the spiritual platform one has to be equipped with transcendental knowledge, which is above the principles of religious rituals. Mundane religious activity is known as *smārta-viddhi,* but transcendental devotional service is called *gosvāmi-viddhi.* Unfortunately many so-called *gosvāmīs* are on the platform of *smārta-viddhi,* yet they try to pass as *gosvāmi-viddhi,* and thus the people are cheated. *Gosvāmī-viddhi* is strictly explained in Sanātana Gosvāmī’s *Hari-bhakti-vilāsa,* wherein it is stated:

*yathā kāñcanatāṁ yāti* *kāṁsyaṁ rasa-vidhānataḥ  
tathā dīkṣā-vidhānena* *dvijatvaṁ jāyate nṛṇām*

“By chemical manipulation, bell metal is turned into gold when touched by mercury; similarly, when a person is properly initiated, he can acquire the qualities of a *brāhmaṇa*.”

The conclusion is that devotional service is open for everyone, regardless of caste, creed, time and country. This Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is functioning according to this principle.

īśād apetasya viparyayo ’smṛtiḥ  
tan-māyayāto budha ābhajet taṁ  
bhaktyaikayeśaṁ guru-devatātmā*

### Synonyms

*bhayam* — fear; *dvitīya*-*abhiniveśataḥ* — from the misconception of being a product of material energy; *syāt* — arises; *īśāt* — from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa; *apetasya* — of one who has withdrawn (the conditioned soul); *viparyayaḥ* — reversal of position; *asmṛtiḥ* — no conception of his relationship with the Supreme Lord; *tat*-*māyayā* — because of the illusory energy of the Supreme Lord; *ataḥ* — therefore; *budhaḥ* — one who is wise; *ābhajet* — must worship; *tam* — Him; *bhaktyā* — by devotional service; *ekayā* — undiverted to *karma* and *jñāna*; *īśam* — the Supreme Personality of Godhead; *guru* — as the spiritual master; *devatā* — worshipable Lord; *ātmā* — Supersoul.

### Translation

**“ ‘When the living entity is attracted by the material energy, which is separate from Kṛṣṇa, he is overpowered by fear. Because he is separated from the Supreme Personality of Godhead by the material energy, his conception of life is reversed. In other words, instead of being the eternal servant of Kṛṣṇa, he becomes Kṛṣṇa’s competitor. This is called viparyayo ’smṛtiḥ. To nullify this mistake, one who is actually learned and advanced worships the Supreme Personality of Godhead as his spiritual master, worshipful Deity and source of life. He thus worships the Lord by the process of unalloyed devotional service.’**

He is directly and indirectly conscious of all manifestations, and He is independent because there is no other cause beyond Him. It is He only who first imparted the Vedic knowledge unto the heart of Brahmājī, the original living being. By Him even the great sages and demigods are placed into illusion, as one is bewildered by the illusory representations of water seen in fire, or land seen on water. Only because of Him do the material universes, temporarily manifested by the reactions of the three modes of nature, appear factual, although they are unreal. I therefore meditate upon Him, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, who is eternally existent in the transcendental abode, which is forever free from the illusory representations of the material world. I meditate upon Him, for He is the Absolute Truth.**

Both Navadvīpa and Vārāṇasī were celebrated for their highly educational activities. At the present time these cities are still inhabited by great, learned scholars, but Vārāṇasī is especially a center for Māyāvādī *sannyāsīs* who are learned scholars. However, unlike Navadvīpa, there are hardly any devotees in Vārāṇasī. Consequently a discussion of *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* was very rare in Vārāṇasī. In Navadvīpa, such a discussion was quite ordinary. After Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu visited Vārānaṣī and turned Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī and his disciples into Vaiṣṇavas, Vārāṇasī became like Navadvīpa because so many devotees began discussing *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.* Even at the present moment one can hear many discussions on *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* taking place on the banks of the Ganges. Many scholars and *sannyāsīs* gather there to hear *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* and perform *saṅkīrtana.*

### Purport

When we began distributing the message of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu in the Western countries, a similar thing happened. In the beginning we were very much disappointed for at least one year because no one came forth to help this movement, but by the grace of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, some young boys joined this movement in 1966. Of course we distributed Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s message of the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra* without bargaining or selling. As a result, this movement has spread all over the world, with the assistance of European and American boys and girls. We therefore pray for all the blessings of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu upon all the devotees in the Western world who are spreading this movement.

### Purport

Following in the footsteps of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, we have constructed temples in both Vṛndāvana and Māyāpur, Navadvīpa, just to give shelter to the foreign devotees coming from Europe and America. Since the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement started, many Europeans and Americans have been visiting Vṛndāvana, but they have not been properly received by any *āśrama* or temple there. It is the purpose of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness to give them shelter and train them in devotional service. There are also many tourists eager to come to India to understand India’s spiritual life, and the devotees in our temples both in Vṛndāvana and in Navadvīpa should make arrangements to accommodate them as far as possible.

### Translation

**This became a perplexing problem for him because his wife kept requesting him to kill Subuddhi Rāya. Finally the Nawab sprinkled a little water on Subuddhi Rāya’s head from a pitcher that had been used by a Muslim.**

### Purport

Five hundred years ago in India, the Hindus were so rigid and strict that if a Muslim would sprinkle a little water from his pitcher upon a Hindu, the Hindu would be immediately ostracized. Recently, in 1947, during the partition days, there was a big riot between Hindus and Muslims, especially in Bengal. The Hindus were forcibly made to eat cow’s flesh, and consequently they began crying, thinking that they had become Muslims. Actually the Muslims in India did not come from the country of the Muslims, but Hindus instituted the custom that somehow or other if one contacted a Muslim, he became a Muslim. Rūpa Gosvāmī and Sanātana Gosvāmī were born in a high *brāhmaṇa* family, but because they accepted employment under a Muslim government, they were considered Muslims. Subuddhi Rāya was sprinkled with water from the pitcher of a Muslim, and consequently he was condemned to have become a Muslim. Later, Aurangzeb, the Muslim emperor, introduced a tax especially meant for Hindus. Being oppressed in the Hindu community, many low-caste Hindus preferred to become Muslims. In this way the Muslim population increased. Later the British government made it a policy to divide the Hindus and the Muslims, and thus they maintained ill feelings between them. The result was that India was divided into Pakistan and Hindustan.

From early histories it appears that the entire earth was under one culture, Vedic culture, but gradually, due to religious and cultural divisions, the rule fragmented into many subdivisions. Now the earth is divided into many countries, religions and political parties. Despite these political and religious divisions, we advocate that everyone should unite again under one culture — Kṛṣṇa consciousness. People should accept one God, Kṛṣṇa; one scripture, the *Bhagavad-gītā*; and one activity, devotional service to the Lord. Thus people may live happily upon this earth and combine to produce sufficient food. In such a society, there would be no question of scarcity, famine or cultural or religious degradation. So-called caste systems and national divisions are artificial. According to our Vaiṣṇava philosophy, these are all external bodily designations. The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is not based upon bodily designations. It is a transcendental movement on the platform of spiritual understanding. If the people of the world understood that the basic principle of life is spiritual identification, they would understand that the business of the spirit soul is to serve the Supreme Spirit, Kṛṣṇa. As Lord Kṛṣṇa says in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (15.7), *mamaivāṁśo jīva-loke jīva-bhūtaḥ sanātanaḥ:* “The living entities in this conditioned world are My eternal fragmental parts.” All living entities in different life forms are sons of Kṛṣṇa. Therefore they are all meant to serve Kṛṣṇa, the original supreme father. If this philosophy is accepted, the failure of the United Nations to unite all nations will be sufficiently compensated all over the world by a great Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. Recently we had talks with Christian leaders in Australia, including the Catholic Bishop of Melbourne, and everyone there was pleased with our philosophy of oneness in religious consciousness.

### Synonyms

*tabe* — upon this; *subuddhi*-*rāya* — Subuddhi Rāya; *sei* — that; *chadma* — plea; *pāñā* — getting an opportunity; *vārāṇasī* *āilā* — came to Vārāṇasī; *saba* — all; *viṣaya* *chāḍiyā* — giving up the implications of material activities.

### Translation

**Taking the Nawab’s sprinkling water upon him as an opportunity, Subuddhi Rāya left his family and business affairs and went to Vārāṇasī.**

### Purport

It appears that Subuddhi Rāya was a big landholder and a responsible, respectable gentleman. He could not, however, avoid the social misconception that one becomes a Muslim when water is sprinkled on one’s face from a Muslim’s pitcher. Actually he was planning to give up his material life and leave his family. Hindu culture recommends four divisions — *brahmacarya, gṛhastha, vānaprastha* and *sannyāsa.* Subuddhi Rāya was thinking of taking *sannyāsa,* and by the grace of Kṛṣṇa, he received this opportunity. He therefore left his family and went to Vārāṇasī. The system of *varṇāśrama-dharma* is very scientific. If one is directed by the *varṇāśrama* institution, he will naturally think of retiring from family life at the end of his life. Therefore *sannyāsa* is compulsory at the age of fifty.

### Purport

This is another instance of Hindu custom. One *brāhmaṇa* would give advice condoning a particular fault, and another would give advice to the contrary. Typically, lawyers and physicians differ, giving one kind of instruction and then another. Due to the *brāhmaṇas’* different opinions, Subuddhi Rāya became further perplexed. He did not know what to do or what not to do.

### Translation

**The Lord advised him, “Go to Vṛndāvana and chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra constantly.”**

### Purport

This is a solution to all sinful activities. In this Age of Kali everyone is perplexed by so many inconveniences — social, political and religious — and naturally no one is happy. Due to the contamination of this age, everyone has a very short life. There are many fools and rascals who advise people to adopt this way of life or that way of life, but real liberation from life’s perplexities means preparation for the next life. *Tathā dehāntara-prāptir dhīras tatra na muhyati.* One should be situated in his spiritual identity and return home, back to Godhead. The simplest method for this is recommended herein by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. We should constantly chant the holy names of the Lord, the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra.* Following in the footsteps of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is recommending this process all over the world. We are saying, “Chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra,* be freed from all the complexities of life, and realize Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Engage in His devotional service and perfect your life so that you can return home, back to Godhead.”

### Translation

**Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu further advised Subuddhi Rāya: “Begin chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra, and when your chanting is almost pure, all your sinful reactions will go away. After you chant perfectly, you will get shelter at the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa.**

### Purport

The ten kinds of offenses should be considered. In the beginning, when one is initiated into the chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra,* there are naturally many offenses. Therefore the devotee should very carefully try to avoid these offenses and chant purely. This does not mean that the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra* is sometimes pure and sometimes impure. Rather, the chanter is impure due to material contamination. He has to purify himself so that the holy names will be perfectly effective. Chanting the holy name of the Lord inoffensively will help one get immediate shelter at Kṛṣṇa’s lotus feet. This means that by chanting purely, one will immediately be situated on the transcendental platform. We should note, however, that according to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s instructions, one should not wait to purify himself before chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra.* Whatever our condition may be, we should begin chanting immediately. By the power of the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra,* we will gradually be relieved from all material contamination and will get shelter at the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, the ultimate goal of life.

### Purport

In those days there was no banking system like the one now found in Western countries. If one had excess money, he would deposit it with some merchant, usually a grocer. That was the banking system. Subuddhi Rāya would deposit his extra money with a mercantile man and spend it when necessary. When one is in the renounced order, saving money is not recommended. However, if one saves money for the service of the Lord or a Vaiṣṇava, that is accepted. These are the dealings of Subuddhi Rāya, who is one of the confidential devotees of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī also followed this principle by spending fifty percent of his money in order to serve Kṛṣṇa through *brāhmaṇas* and Vaiṣṇavas. He gave twenty-five percent of his money to relatives, and twenty-five percent he deposited in the custody of a merchant. These are the approved methods recommended in the *Caitanya-caritāmṛta.* Whether in the renounced order or in the *gṛhastha* order, a Vaiṣṇava should follow these principles set forth by the previous *ācāryas.*

**Subuddhi Rāya used to spend his savings to supply yogurt to Bengali Vaiṣṇavas who came to Mathurā. He also gave them cooked rice and oil massages. When he saw a poverty-stricken Vaiṣṇava, he would use his money to feed him.**

### Purport

There is a special reference for the maintenance of Bengali Vaiṣṇavas. A Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava is a Bengali Vaiṣṇava. Most of the devotees of Lord Caitanya at that time were Gauḍīyas and Oriyās, inhabitants of Bengal and Orissa. There are still many hundreds of thousands of His followers in Bengal and Orissa. Bengalis are habituated to eating cooked rice as their staple food. When they went to Mathurā in the north, they found that the people generally ate chapatis or *roṭis* made of wheat. The Bengalis could not digest this food because they were used to cooked rice. Therefore as soon as Subuddhi Rāya saw a Bengali Vaiṣṇava arriving in Mathurā, he would try to supply him with cooked rice. Bengalis are also accustomed to taking a massage with mustard oil. In any case, Subuddhi Rāya wanted to serve the Vaiṣṇavas according to their needs. Therefore he would supply yogurt to ease the digestion of food eaten in Mathurā, particularly the chapatis and *roṭis* made with wheat*.*

### Translation

**To deliver all fallen souls, the Lord traveled from country to country. He personally tasted the transcendental pleasure of devotional service, and He simultaneously spread the cult of devotion everywhere.**

### Purport

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu personally traveled to different regions of India to spread the *bhakti* cult throughout the country. He also personally relished transcendental activities. By His personal behavior He has given an example for devotees to follow. That is, one should broadcast the cult of devotional service. He specifically instructed His devotees to enjoin all Indians to broadcast this message throughout the world because at that time the Lord could not personally travel to other parts of the world. In this regard, He has left two instructions:

*bhārata-bhūmite haila manuṣya-janma yāra  
janma sārthaka kari’ kara para-upakāra*

“All Indians should seriously take up the cult of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and should perfect their lives by adopting the process of devotional service. After perfecting their lives, they should broadcast this message all over the world for the welfare of all human beings \[*para-upakāra*\]*.*” (Cc. *Ādi* 9.41) A Vaiṣṇava is especially interested in *para-upakāra,* doing good to others. Prahlāda Mahārāja was also interested in this. He did not want to be delivered alone; rather, he wanted to deliver all fallen souls, who are bereft of knowledge of *bhakti* and who misuse their intelligence for the temporary benefit of the material body. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu also wanted His mission spread all over the world.

*pṛthivīte āche yata nagarādi grāma  
sarvatra pracāra haibe mora nāma*

“In every town and village, the chanting of My name will be heard.” (*Caitanya-bhāgavata, Antya* 4.126)

Following in the footsteps of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, we are trying to broadcast His message throughout the world. By His mercy, people are taking this movement very seriously. Indeed, our books are extensively distributed in the Western countries, especially in America and Europe. Even the ecclesiastical orders in these countries are appreciating the value of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement and are ready to unite for the highest benefit of human society. The followers of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu may therefore take this movement seriously and broadcast it throughout the world, from village to village and from town to town, just as Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu Himself did.

As Lord Kṛṣṇa states in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (7.3):

*manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu* *kaścid yatati siddhaye  
yatatām api siddhānāṁ* *kaścin māṁ vetti tattvataḥ*

“Out of many thousands among men, one may endeavor for perfection, and of those who have achieved perfection, hardly one knows Me in truth.”

It is very difficult to understand Kṛṣṇa, but if one tries to understand *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* through Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s *bhakti* cult, one will undoubtedly understand Kṛṣṇa very easily. If somehow or other one understands Kṛṣṇa, his life is successful. Again, as Kṛṣṇa states in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (4.9):

*janma karma ca me divyam* *evaṁ yo vetti tattvataḥ  
tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma* *naiti mām eti so ’rjuna*

“One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna.”

### Synonyms

*kṛṣṇa*-*līlā* *amṛta*-*sāra* — the pastimes of Lord Kṛṣṇa are the essence of all eternal bliss; *tāra* *śata* *śata* *dhāra* — the flow of that eternal bliss is running in hundreds of branches; *daśa*-*dike* — in all the ten directions; *vahe* — flows; *yāhā* *haite* — from which; *se* — those; *caitanya*-*līlā* — pastimes of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu; *haya* — are; *sarovara* *akṣaya* — a transcendental eternal lake; *manaḥ*-*haṁsa* — my mind, which is like a swan; *carāha’* — please wander; *tāhāte* — in that lake.

### Translation

**The pastimes of Lord Kṛṣṇa are the essence of all nectar, and that nectar is flowing in hundreds of rivers in all directions. The pastimes of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu are an eternal reservoir, and one is advised to let his mind swim like a swan on this transcendental lake.**

### Purport

The essence of spiritual knowledge is found in the pastimes of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, which are identical with the pastimes of Lord Kṛṣṇa. This is the essence of knowledge. If knowledge does not include the understanding of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and Kṛṣṇa, it is simply superfluous. By Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s grace, the nectar of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa’s pastimes is flowing in different directions in hundreds and thousands of rivers. One should not think that the pastimes of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu are different from Kṛṣṇa’s pastimes. It is said, *śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya, rādhā-kṛṣṇa nahe anya:* “Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu is a combination of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa.” Thus without understanding the pastimes of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, one cannot understand Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa. Śrīla Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura therefore sings, *rūpa-raghunātha-pade haibe ākuti/ kabe hāma bujhaba se yugala pirīti:* “When shall I become very eager to study the books left by the six Gosvāmīs? Then I shall be able to understand the conjugal pastimes of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa.” Caitanya Mahāprabhu directly empowered Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī and Śrīla Sanātana Gosvāmī. Following in their footsteps, the other Gosvāmīs understood Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and His mission. One should understand Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya and Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa from the six Gosvāmīs in the *paramparā* system. The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is following as strictly as possible in the footsteps of the Gosvāmīs. Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura says, *ei chaya gosāñi yāṅra, mui tāṅra dāsa:* “I am the servant of the six Gosvāmīs.” The philosophy of Kṛṣṇa consciousness is to become the servant of the servant of the servant of the Lord. Whoever wants to understand the difficult subject matter of *kṛṣṇa-kathā* should accept the disciplic succession. If one is somehow or other able to understand Kṛṣṇa, his life is successful. *Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti so ’rjuna.* A perfect devotee is able to understand Kṛṣṇa through the disciplic succession, and his entrance into the kingdom of God is thereby certainly opened. When one understands Kṛṣṇa, there is no difficulty in transferring oneself to the spiritual kingdom.

### Translation

**The devotees who have a relationship with Kṛṣṇa are like the swans and cakravāka birds who play in that forest of lotus flowers. The buds of those lotus flowers are the pastimes of Kṛṣṇa, and they are edibles for the swanlike devotees. Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa is always engaged in His transcendental pastimes; therefore the devotees, following in the footsteps of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, can always eat those lotus buds, for they are the pastimes of the Lord.**

### Translation

**The Caitanya-caritāmṛta pastimes of Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu constitute a very secret literature. It is the life and soul of all devotees. Those who are not fit to relish this literature, who are envious like hogs and pigs, will certainly not adore it. However, this will not harm my attempt. These pastimes of Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu will certainly please all saintly people who have clear hearts. They will certainly enjoy it. We wish that this will enhance their enjoyment more and more.**

### Purport

*Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports to* Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta, Madhya-līlā, *twenty-fifth chapter, describing how the inhabitants of Vārāṇasī were converted* to *Vaiṣṇavism.*

**Note:**

The author of *Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta,* Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī, has condemned all his enemies by comparing them to envious hogs and pigs. The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, which is spreading throughout the world, is being appreciated by sincere people, although they have never previously heard of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and Kṛṣṇa’s pastimes. Now even the higher, priestly circles are appreciating this movement. They have concluded that this movement is very nice and that they have something to learn from it. Nonetheless, in India there are some people who say that they belong to this cult but who are actually very envious of the *ācārya.* They have tried to suppress our activities in many ways, but as far as we are concerned, we follow in the footsteps of Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī and take them as envious pigs and hogs. We simply wish to present the pastimes of Lord Kṛṣṇa and Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu to the best of our ability so that those who are really honest can cleanse their hearts. We hope that they enjoy this literature and bestow their blessings upon us. It appears that even such a great personality as Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī met with some envious obstacles; what, then, to speak of us, who are only insignificant creatures in this universe. We are simply trying to execute the orders of our spiritual master to the best of our ability.
