CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO

In the twenty-second chapter, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu describes the process of devotional service. In the beginning He describes the truth about the living entity and the superexcellence of devotional service. He then describes the uselessness of mental speculation and mystic *yoga.* In all circumstances the living entity is recommended to accept the path of devotional service as personally explained by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. The speculative method of the so-called *jñānīs* is considered a waste of time, and that is proved in this chapter. An intelligent person should abandon the processes of *karma-kāṇḍa, jñāna-kāṇḍa* and mystic *yoga.* One should give up all these useless processes and take seriously to the path of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. In this way one’s life will be successful. If one takes to Kṛṣṇa consciousness fully, even though he may sometimes be agitated due to having previously practiced mental speculation and yogic mysticism, he will be saved by Lord Kṛṣṇa Himself. The fact is that devotional service is bestowed by the blessings of a pure devotee (*sa mahātmā su-durlabhaḥ*)*.* A pure devotee is the supreme transcendentalist, and one has to receive his mercy for one’s dormant Kṛṣṇa consciousness to be awakened. One has to associate with pure devotees. If one has firm faith in the words of a great soul, pure devotional service will awaken.

In this chapter Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu differentiates between a pure devotee and others. He also describes the characteristics of a pure devotee. A devotee’s most formidable enemy is association with women in an enjoying spirit. Association with nondevotees is also condemned because it is also a formidable enemy on the path of devotional service. One has to fully surrender unto the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa and give up attraction for women and nondevotees.

The six symptoms of fully surrendered souls are also described in this chapter. Devotional service has been divided into two categories — regulative devotional service and spontaneous love. There are sixty-four items listed in regulative devotional service, and out of these sixty-four the last five are considered very important. By practicing even one of the nine processes of devotional service, one can become successful. Speculative knowledge and mystic *yoga* can never help one in devotional service. Pious activity, nonviolence, sense control and regulation are not separate from devotional service in its pure form. If one engages in devotional service, all good qualities follow. One does not have to cultivate them separately. Spontaneous devotional service arises when one follows a pure devotee who is awakened to spontaneous love of God. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu describes the symptoms of devotees who are already situated in spontaneous love of God. He also describes the devotees who are trying to follow in the footsteps of the pure devotees.

### Purport

The Lord has many potencies, and He is nondifferent from all these potencies. Because the potencies and the potent cannot be separated, they are identical. Kṛṣṇa is described as the source of all potencies, and He is also identified with the external potency, the material energy. Kṛṣṇa also has internal potencies, or spiritual potencies, which are always engaged in His personal service. His internal potency is different from His external potency. Kṛṣṇa’s internal potency and Kṛṣṇa Himself, who is the potent, are always identical.

स्वांश-विस्तार — चतुर्व्यूह, अवतारगण ।

### Verse text

*svāṁśa-vistāra — catur-vyūha, avatāra-gaṇa  
vibhinnāṁśa jīva — tāṅra śaktite gaṇana*

### Synonyms

*sva*-*aṁśa*-*vistāra* — the expansion of His personal forms; *catur*-*vyūha* — His quadruple form; *avatāra*-*gaṇa* — the incarnations; *vibhinna*-*aṁśa* — His separated forms; *jīva* — the living entities; *tāṅra* — His; *śaktite* — in the category of potency; *gaṇana* — calculating.

### Translation

**“Expansions of His personal self — like the quadruple manifestations of Saṅkarṣaṇa, Pradyumna, Aniruddha and Vāsudeva — descend as incarnations from Vaikuṇṭha to this material world. The separated expansions are the living entities. Although they are expansions of Kṛṣṇa, they are counted among His different potencies.**

### Purport

The personal expansions are known as *viṣṇu-tattva,* and the separated expansions are known as *jīva-tattva.* Although the *jīvas* (living entities) are part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they are still counted among His multipotencies. This is fully described by Lord Kṛṣṇa in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (7.5):

*apareyam itas tv anyāṁ* *prakṛtiṁ viddhi me parām  
jīva-bhūtāṁ mahā-bāho* *yayedaṁ dhāryate jagat*

“Besides this inferior nature, O mighty-armed Arjuna, there is another, superior energy of Mine, which comprises the living entities who are exploiting the resources of this material, inferior nature.”

Although the living entities are Kṛṣṇa’s parts and parcels, they are *prakṛti,* not *puruṣa.* Sometimes *prakṛti* (a living entity) attempts to imitate the activities of the *puruṣa.* Due to a poor fund of knowledge, living entities conditioned in this material world claim to be God. They are thus illusioned. A living entity cannot be on the level of a *viṣṇu-tattva,* or the Personality of Godhead, at any stage; therefore it is ludicrous for a living entity to claim to be God. Advanced spiritualists would never accept such a thing. Such claims are made to cheat ordinary, foolish people. The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement declares war against such bogus incarnations. The bogus propaganda put out by people claiming to be God has killed God consciousness all over the world. Members of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement must be very alert to defy these rascals, who are presently misleading the whole world. One such rascal, known as Pauṇḍraka, appeared before Lord Kṛṣṇa, and the Lord immediately killed him. Of course, those who are Kṛṣṇa’s servants cannot kill such imitation gods, but they should try their best to defeat them through the evidence of *śāstra,* authentic knowledge received through the disciplic succession.

The conditioned soul thus gets into touch with devotional service to Lord Kṛṣṇa, and in this way he can approach nearer and nearer to the Lord.**

### Purport

An explanation of verses 8 through 15 is given by Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura in his *Amṛta-pravāha-bhāṣya.* The Lord is spread throughout the creation in His quadruple expansions and incarnations. Kṛṣṇa is fully represented with all potencies in each and every personal extension, but the living entities, although separated expansions, are also considered one of the Lord’s energies. The living entities are divided into two categories — the eternally liberated and the eternally conditioned. Those who are ever liberated never come in contact with *māyā,* the external energy. The ever-conditioned souls are always under the clutches of the external energy. This is described by Lord Kṛṣṇa in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (7.14):

*daivī hy eṣā guṇamayī* *mama māyā duratyayā*

“This divine energy of Mine, consisting of the three modes of material nature, is difficult to overcome.”

The *nitya-baddhas* are always conditioned by the external energy, and the *nitya-muktas* never come in contact with the external energy. Sometimes an ever-liberated personal associate of the Supreme Personality of Godhead descends into this universe just as the Lord descends. Although working for the liberation of conditioned souls, the messenger of the Supreme Lord remains untouched by the material energy. Generally ever-liberated personalities live in the spiritual world as associates of Lord Kṛṣṇa, and they are known as *kṛṣṇa-pāriṣada,* associates of the Lord. Their only business is enjoying Lord Kṛṣṇa’s company, and even though such eternally liberated persons come within this material world to serve the Lord’s purpose, they enjoy Lord Kṛṣṇa’s company without stoppage. The ever-liberated person who works on Kṛṣṇa’s behalf enjoys Lord Kṛṣṇa’s company through his engagement. The ever-conditioned soul, provoked by lusty desires to enjoy the material world, is forced to transmigrate from one body to another. Sometimes he is elevated to higher planetary systems, and sometimes he is degraded to hellish planets and subjected to the tribulations of the external energy.

Due to being conditioned by the external energy, the conditioned soul within this material world gets two kinds of bodies — a gross material body and a subtle material body composed of mind, intelligence and ego. Due to the gross and subtle bodies, he is subjected to the threefold miseries (*ādhyātmika, ādhibhautika* and *ādhidaivika*), miseries arising from the body and mind, other living entities and natural disturbances caused by demigods from higher planetary systems. The conditioned soul subjected to the threefold material miseries is ceaselessly kicked by *māyā,* and this is his disease. If by chance he meets a saintly person who works on Kṛṣṇa’s behalf to deliver conditioned souls, and if he agrees to abide by his order, he can gradually approach the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa.

### Translation

**“ ‘O my Lord, there is no limit to the unwanted orders of lusty desires. Although I have rendered these desires so much service, they have not shown any mercy to me. I have not been ashamed to serve them, nor have I even desired to give them up. O my Lord, O head of the Yadu dynasty, recently, however, my intelligence has been awakened, and now I am giving them up. Due to transcendental intelligence, I now refuse to obey the unwanted orders of these desires, and I now come to You to surrender myself at Your fearless lotus feet. Kindly engage me in Your personal service and save me.’**

### Purport

This verse is also quoted in the *Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu* (3.2.35). When we chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra* we are saying, “Hare! O energy of the Lord! O my Lord Kṛṣṇa!” In this way we are simply addressing the Lord and His spiritual potency, represented as Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa, Sītā-Rāma or Lakṣmī-Nārāyaṇa. The devotee always prays to the Lord and His internal energy (consort) so that he may engage in Their transcendental loving service. When the conditioned soul attains his real spiritual energy and fully surrenders unto the Lord’s lotus feet, he tries to engage in the Lord’s service. This is the real constitutional position of the living entity.

### Verse text

*ei saba sādhanera ati tuccha bala

### Synonyms

*ei* *saba* — all these; *sādhanera* — of methods of spiritual activities; *ati* — very; *tuccha* — insignificant; *bala* — strength; *kṛṣṇa*-*bhakti* — devotional service to Lord Kṛṣṇa; *vinā* — without; *tāhā* — all these; *dite* — to deliver; *nāre* — are not able; *phala* — the desired result.

### Translation

**“Without devotional service, all other methods for spiritual self-realization are weak and insignificant. Unless one comes to the devotional service of Lord Kṛṣṇa, jñāna and yoga cannot give the desired results.**

### Purport

In the Vedic scriptures, stress is sometimes given to fruitive activity, speculative knowledge and the mystic *yoga* system. Although people are inclined to practice these processes, they cannot attain the desired results without being touched by *kṛṣṇa-bhakti,* devotional service. In other words, the real desired result is to invoke dormant love for Kṛṣṇa. *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (1.2.6) states:

*sa vai puṁsāṁ paro dharmo* *yato bhaktir adhokṣaje  
ahaituky apratihatā* *yayātmā suprasīdati*

“The supreme occupation \[*dharma*\] for all humanity is that by which men can attain to loving devotional service unto the transcendent Lord. Such devotional service must be unmotivated and uninterrupted to completely satisfy the self.” *Karma, jñāna* and *yoga* cannot actually awaken love of Godhead. One has to take to the Lord’s devotional service, and the more one is inclined to devotional service, the more he loses interest in other so-called achievements. Dhruva Mahārāja went to practice mystic *yoga* to see the Lord personally, face to face, but when he developed an interest in devotional service, he saw that he was not being benefited by *karma, jñāna* and *yoga.*

*naiṣkarmyam* — which does not produce enjoyment of the resultant action; *api* — although; *acyuta*-*bhāva* — of devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead; *varjitam* — devoid; *na* — not; *śobhate* — looks beautiful; *jñānam* — speculative knowledge; *alam* — exceedingly; *nirañjanam* — which is without material contamination; *kutaḥ* — how much less; *punaḥ* — again; *śaśvat* — always (at the time of practicing and at the time of achieving the goal); *abhadram* — inauspicious; *īśvare* — to the Supreme Personality of Godhead; *na* — not; *ca* — also; *arpitam* — dedicated; *karma* — activities; *yat* — which; *api* — although; *akāraṇam* — causeless.

### Translation

**“ ‘When pure knowledge is beyond all material affinity but is not dedicated to the Supreme Personality of Godhead \[Kṛṣṇa\], it does not appear very beautiful, although it is knowledge without a material tinge. What, then, is the use of fruitive activities — which are naturally painful from the beginning and transient by nature — if they are not utilized for the devotional service of the Lord? How can they be very attractive?’**

### Purport

This is a quotation from *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (1.5.12). Even after writing many Vedic literatures, Vyāsadeva felt very morose. Therefore his spiritual master, Nāradadeva, told him that he could be happy by writing about the activities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Up to that time, Śrīla Vyāsadeva had written the *karma-kāṇḍa* and *jñāna-kāṇḍa* sections of the *Vedas,* but he had not written about *upāsanā-kāṇḍa,* or *bhakti.* Thus his spiritual master, Nārada, chastised him and advised him to write about the activities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore Vyāsadeva began writing *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.*

### Verse text

*kevala jñāna ‘mukti’ dite nāre bhakti vine  
kṛṣṇonmukhe sei mukti haya vinā jñāne*

### Synonyms

*kevala* — only; *jñāna* — speculative knowledge; *mukti* — liberation; *dite* — to deliver; *nāre* — is not able; *bhakti* *vine* — without devotional service; *kṛṣṇa*-*unmukhe* — if one is attached to the service of Lord Kṛṣṇa; *sei* *mukti* — that liberation; *haya* — appears; *vinā* — without; *jñāne* — knowledge.

### Translation

**“Speculative knowledge alone, without devotional service, is not able to give liberation. On the other hand, even without knowledge one can obtain liberation if one engages in the Lord’s devotional service.**

### Purport

One cannot attain liberation simply by speculative knowledge. Even though one may be able to distinguish between Brahman and matter, one’s liberation will be hampered if one is misled into thinking that the living entity is as good as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Indeed, one falls down again onto the material platform because considering oneself the Supreme Person, the Supreme Absolute Truth, is offensive. When such a person comes in contact with a pure devotee, he can actually become liberated from material bondage and engage in the Lord’s service. A prayer by Bilvamaṅgala Ṭhākura is relevant here:

*bhaktis tvayi sthiratarā bhagavan yadi syād *
 *daivena naḥ phalati divya-kiśora-mūrtiḥ  
muktiḥ svayaṁ mukulitāñjali sevate ’smān *
 *dharmārtha-kāma-gatayaḥ samaya-pratīkṣāḥ*

“O my Lord, if one engages in Your pure devotional service with determination, You become visible in Your original transcendental youthful form as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As far as liberation is concerned, she stands before the devotee with folded hands waiting to render service. Religion, economic development and sense gratification are all automatically attained without separate endeavor.” (*Kṛṣṇa-karṇāmṛta* 107)

### Translation

**“ ‘My dear Lord, devotional service unto You is the only auspicious path. If one gives it up simply for speculative knowledge or the understanding that these living beings are spirit souls and the material world is false, he undergoes a great deal of trouble. He only gains troublesome and inauspicious activities. His endeavors are like beating a husk that is already devoid of rice. His labor becomes fruitless.’**

*tāte* — therefore; *kṛṣṇa* *bhaje* — if one worships Lord Kṛṣṇa; *kare* — performs; *gurura* *sevana* — service to his spiritual master; *māyā*-*jāla* *chuṭe* — gets free from the binding net of *māyā*; *pāya* — gets; *kṛṣṇera* *caraṇa* — shelter at the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa.

### Translation

**“If the conditioned soul engages in the service of the Lord and simultaneously carries out the orders of his spiritual master and serves him, he can get out of the clutches of māyā and become eligible for shelter at Kṛṣṇa’s lotus feet.**

### Purport

It is a fact that every living entity is eternally a servant of Kṛṣṇa. This is forgotten due to the influence of *māyā,* which induces one to believe in material happiness. Being illusioned by *māyā,* one thinks that material happiness is the only desirable object. This material consciousness is like a chain around the neck of the conditioned soul. As long as he is bound to that conception, he cannot get out of *māyā’s* clutches. However, if by Kṛṣṇa’s mercy he gets in touch with a bona fide spiritual master, abides by his order and serves him, engaging other conditioned souls in the Lord’s service, he then attains liberation and Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa’s shelter.

### Synonyms

*cāri* *varṇa*-*āśramī* — followers of the four social and spiritual orders of life; *yadi* — if; *kṛṣṇa* — Lord Kṛṣṇa; *nāhi* — not; *bhaje* — serve; *sva*-*karma* *karite* — performing his duty in life; *se* — that person; *raurave* — in a hellish condition; *paḍi’* — falling down; *maje* — becomes immersed.

### Translation

**“The followers of the varṇāśrama institution accept the regulative principles of the four social orders \[brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya and śūdra\] and four spiritual orders \[brahmacarya, gṛhastha, vānaprastha and sannyāsa\]. However, if one carries out the regulative principles of these orders but does not render transcendental service to Kṛṣṇa, he falls into a hellish condition of material life.**

### Purport

One may be a *brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya* or *śūdra,* or one may perfectly follow the spiritual principles of *brahmacarya, gṛhastha, vānaprastha* and *sannyāsa,* but ultimately one falls down into a hellish condition unless one becomes a devotee. Without developing one’s dormant Kṛṣṇa consciousness, one cannot be factually elevated. The regulative principles of *varṇāśrama-dharma* in themselves are insufficient for attainment of the highest perfection. That is confirmed in the following two quotations from *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (11.5.2-3).

*kṛṣṇa — sūrya-sama; māyā haya andhakāra  
yāhāṅ kṛṣṇa, tāhāṅ nāhi māyāra adhikāra*

### Synonyms

*kṛṣṇa* — Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead; *sūrya*-*sama* — like the sun planet; *māyā* — the illusory energy; *haya* — is; *andhakāra* — darkness; *yāhāṅ* *kṛṣṇa* — wherever there is Kṛṣṇa; *tāhāṅ* — there; *nāhi* — not; *māyāra* — of *māyā,* or the darkness of illusion; *adhikāra* — the jurisdiction.

### Translation

**“Kṛṣṇa is compared to sunshine, and māyā is compared to darkness. Wherever there is sunshine, there cannot be darkness. As soon as one takes to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, the darkness of illusion (the influence of the external energy) will immediately vanish.**

### Purport

In *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (2.9.34) it is stated:

*ṛte ’rthaṁ yat pratīyeta* *na pratīyeta cātmani  
tad vidyād ātmano māyāṁ* *yathābhāso yathā tamaḥ*

“What appears to be truth without Me is certainly My illusory energy, for nothing can exist without Me. It is like a reflection of a real light in the shadows, for in the light there are neither shadows nor reflections.”

Wherever there is light, there cannot be darkness. When a living entity becomes Kṛṣṇa conscious, he is immediately relieved of all material lusty desires. Lusty desires and greed are associated with *rajas* and *tamas,* passion and darkness. When one becomes Kṛṣṇa conscious, the modes of passion and darkness immediately vanish, and then the mode of goodness (*sattva-guṇa*) remains. When one is situated in the mode of goodness, he can make spiritual advancement and understand things clearly. This position is not possible for everyone. When a person is Kṛṣṇa conscious, he continuously hears about Kṛṣṇa, thinks about Him, worships Him and serves Him as a devotee. If he remains in Kṛṣṇa consciousness in this way, the darkness of *māyā* certainly will not be able to touch him.

### Translation

**“ ‘The external illusory energy of Kṛṣṇa, known as māyā, is always ashamed to stand in front of Kṛṣṇa, just as darkness is ashamed to remain before the sunshine. However, that māyā bewilders unfortunate people who have no intelligence. Thus they simply boast that this material world is theirs and that they are its enjoyers.’**

### Purport

The entire world is bewildered because people are thinking, “This is my land,” “America is mine,” “India is mine.” Not knowing the real value of life, people think that the material body and the land where it is produced are all in all. This is the basic principle behind nationalism, socialism and communism. Such thinking, which simply bewilders the living being, is nothing but rascalism. It is due to the darkness of *māyā.* But as soon as one becomes Kṛṣṇa conscious, he is immediately relieved from such misconceptions. This verse is quoted from *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (2.5.13). There is also another appropriate verse in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (2.7.47):

*śaśvat praśāntam abhayaṁ pratibodha-mātraṁ *
 *śuddhaṁ samaṁ sad-asataḥ paramātma-tattvam  
śabdo na yatra puru-kārakavān kriyārtho *
 *māyā paraity abhimukhe ca vilajjamānā  
tad vai padaṁ bhagavataḥ paramasya puṁso *
 *brahmeti yad vidur ajasra-sukhaṁ viśokam*

“What is realized as the Absolute Brahman is full of unlimited bliss without grief. That is certainly the ultimate phase of the supreme enjoyer, the Personality of Godhead. He is eternally devoid of all disturbances, fearless, completely conscious as opposed to matter, uncontaminated and without distinctions. He is the principal, primeval cause of all causes and effects, in whom there is no sacrifice for fruitive activities and in whom the illusory energy does not stand.”

This verse was spoken by Lord Brahmā when he was questioned by the great sage Nārada. Nārada was surprised to see the creator of the universe meditating, for this indicated there might be someone greater than Lord Brahmā. While answering the great sage Nārada, Lord Brahmā described the position of *māyā* and the bewildered living entities. This verse was spoken in that connection.

*āmi — vijña, ei mūrkhe ‘viṣaya’ kene diba?

*āmi* — I; *vijña* — all-intelligent; *ei* *mūrkhe* — unto this foolish person; *viṣaya* — material enjoyment; *kene* *diba* — why should I give; *sva*-*caraṇa*-*amṛta* — the nectar of shelter at My lotus feet; *diyā* — giving; *viṣaya* — the idea of material enjoyment; *bhulāiba* — I shall make him forget.

### Translation

**“ ‘Since I am very intelligent, why should I give this fool material prosperity? Instead I shall induce him to take the nectar of the shelter of My lotus feet and make him forget illusory material enjoyment.’**

### Purport

Those who are interested in material enjoyment are known as *bhukti-kāmī.* One who is interested in merging into the effulgence of Brahman or perfecting the mystic *yoga* system is not a devotee at all. Devotees do not have such desires. However, if a *karmī, jñānī* or *yogī* somehow contacts a devotee and renders devotional service, Kṛṣṇa immediately awards him love of God and gives him shelter at His lotus feet, although he may have no idea how to develop love of Kṛṣṇa. If a person wants material profit from devotional service, Kṛṣṇa condemns such materialistic desires. To desire material opulence while engaging in devotional service is foolish. Although the person may be foolish, Kṛṣṇa, being all-intelligent, engages him in His devotional service in such a way that he gradually forgets material opulence. The point is that we should not try to exchange loving service for material prosperity. If we are actually surrendered to the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, our only desire should be to satisfy Kṛṣṇa. That is pure Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Surrender means not that we demand something from the Lord but that we completely depend on His mercy. If Kṛṣṇa likes, He may keep His devotee in a poverty-stricken condition, or if He likes He may keep him in an opulent position. The devotee should not be concerned in either case; he should simply be very serious about trying to satisfy the Lord by rendering Him service.

*kona* *bhāgye* — by fortune; *kāro* — of someone; *saṁsāra* — conditioned life; *kṣaya*-*unmukha* — on the point of destruction; *haya* — is; *sādhu*-*saṅge* — by association with devotees; *tabe* — then; *kṛṣṇe* — to Lord Kṛṣṇa; *rati* — attraction; *upajaya* — awakens.

### Translation

**“By good fortune one becomes eligible to cross the ocean of nescience, and when one’s term of material existence decreases, one may get an opportunity to associate with pure devotees. By such association, one’s attraction to Kṛṣṇa is awakened.**

### Purport

Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura explains this point. Is this *bhāgya* (fortune) the result of an accident or something else? In the scriptures, devotional service and pious activity are considered fortunate. Pious activities can be divided into three categories: pious activities that awaken one’s dormant Kṛṣṇa consciousness are called *bhakty-unmukhī sukṛti,* pious activities that bestow material opulence are called *bhogonmukhī sukṛti,* and pious activities that enable the living entity to merge into the existence of the Supreme are called *mokṣonmukhī sukṛti.* These last two awards of pious activity are not actually fortunate. Pious activities are fortunate when they help one become Kṛṣṇa conscious. The good fortune of *bhakty-unmukhī* is attainable only when one comes in contact with a devotee. By associating with a devotee willingly or unwillingly, one advances in devotional service, and thus one’s dormant Kṛṣṇa consciousness is awakened.

*mahat*-*kṛpā* — the mercy of great devotees; *vinā* — without; *kona* *karme* — by some other activity; *bhakti* *naya* — there is not devotional service; *kṛṣṇa*-*bhakti* — love of Kṛṣṇa or devotional service to Kṛṣṇa; *dūre* *rahu* — leaving aside; *saṁsāra* — the bondage of material existence; *nahe* — there is not; *kṣaya* — destruction.

### Translation

**“Unless one is favored by a pure devotee, one cannot attain the platform of devotional service. To say nothing of kṛṣṇa-bhakti, one cannot even be relieved from the bondage of material existence.**

### Purport

Pious activities bring about material opulence, but one cannot acquire devotional service by any amount of material pious activity — not by giving charity, opening big hospitals and schools or working philanthropically. Devotional service can be attained only by the mercy of a pure devotee. Without a pure devotee’s mercy, one cannot even escape the bondage of material existence. The word *mahat* in this verse means “a pure devotee,” as Lord Kṛṣṇa confirms in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (9.13):

*mahātmānas tu māṁ pārtha* *daivīṁ prakṛtim āśritāḥ  
bhajanty ananya-manaso* *jñātvā bhūtādim avyayam*

“O son of Pṛthā, those who are not deluded, the great souls, are under the protection of the divine nature. They are fully engaged in devotional service because they know Me as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, original and inexhaustible.”

One has to associate with such a *mahātmā,* who has accepted Kṛṣṇa as the supreme source of the entire creation. Without being a *mahātmā,* one cannot understand Kṛṣṇa’s absolute position. A *mahātmā* is rare and transcendental, and he is a pure devotee of Lord Kṛṣṇa. Foolish people consider Kṛṣṇa a human being, and they consider Lord Kṛṣṇa’s pure devotee an ordinary human being also. Whatever one may be, one must take shelter at the lotus feet of a devotee *mahātmā* and treat him as the most exalted well-wisher of all human society. We should take shelter of such a *mahātmā* and ask for his causeless mercy. Only by his benediction can one be relieved from attachment to the materialistic way of life. When one is thus relieved, he can engage in the Lord’s transcendental loving service through the mercy of the *mahātmā.*

### Translation

**“ ‘O King Rahūgaṇa, without taking upon one’s head the dust from the lotus feet of a pure devotee \[a mahājana or mahātmā\], one cannot attain devotional service. Devotional service is not possible to attain simply by undergoing severe austerities and penances, by gorgeously worshiping the Deity, or by strictly following the rules and regulations of the sannyāsa or gṛhastha order; nor is it attained by studying the Vedas, submerging oneself in water, or exposing oneself to fire or scorching sunlight.’**

At that time Jaḍa Bharata informed the King how to become detached from material attraction.

Prahlāda Mahārāja had informed his father of the nine basic processes of *bhakti-yoga,* explaining that whoever takes to these processes is to be considered a highly learned scholar. Hiraṇyakaśipu, however, did not like his son to talk about devotional service; therefore he immediately called Prahlāda’s teacher, Ṣaṇḍa. The teacher explained that he had not taught devotional service to Prahlāda but that the boy was naturally inclined that way. At that time Hiraṇyakaśipu became very angry and asked Prahlāda why he had become a Vaiṣṇava. In answer to this question, Prahlāda Mahārāja recited this verse to the effect that one cannot become the Lord’s devotee without receiving the mercy and blessings of another devotee.

### Purport

This is a quotation from *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (1.18.13). This verse concerns the Vedic rites and sacrifices performed by the great sages of Naimiṣāraṇya, headed by Śaunaka Ṛṣi. The sages pointed out that association with a devotee for even less than a second is beyond comparison to a thousand Vedic rituals and sacrifices, elevation to heavenly planets or merging into the existence of the Supreme.

### Purport

Firm faith and confidence are called *śraddhā.* When one engages in the Lord’s devotional service, he is to be understood to have performed all his responsibilities in the material world. He has satisfied his forefathers, ordinary living entities, and demigods and is free from all responsibility. Such a person does not need to meet his responsibilities separately. It is automatically done. Fruitive activity (*karma*) is meant to satisfy the senses of the conditioned soul. However, when one awakens to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he does not have to work separately for pious activity. The best achievement of all fruitive activity is detachment from material life, and this detachment is spontaneously enjoyed by the devotee firmly engaged in the Lord’s service.

### Translation

**“A devotee is considered superlative or superior according to his attachment and love. In the Eleventh Canto of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, the following symptoms have been given.**

### Purport

Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura has stated that if one has developed faith in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he is to be considered an eligible candidate for further advancement in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Those who have faith are divided into three categories — *uttama, madhyama* and *kaniṣṭha* (first class, second class and neophyte). A first-class devotee has firm conviction in the revealed scriptures and is expert in arguing according to the *śāstras.* He is firmly convinced of the science of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. The *madhyama-adhikārī,* or second-class devotee, has firm conviction in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, but he cannot support his conviction by citing śāstric references. The neophyte devotee does not yet have firm faith. In this way the devotees are typed.

The standard of devotion is also categorized in the same way. A neophyte believes that only love of Kṛṣṇa or Kṛṣṇa consciousness is very good, but he may not know the basis of pure Kṛṣṇa consciousness or how one can become a perfect devotee. Sometimes in the heart of a neophyte there is attraction for *karma, jñāna* or *yoga.* When he is free and transcendental to mixed devotional activity, he becomes a second-class devotee. When he becomes expert in logic and can refer to the *śāstras,* he becomes a first-class devotee. The devotees are also described as positive, comparative and superlative in terms of their love and attachment for Kṛṣṇa.

It should be understood that a *madhyama-adhikārī,* a second-class devotee, is fully convinced of Kṛṣṇa consciousness but cannot support his convictions with śāstric reference. A neophyte may fall down by associating with nondevotees because he is not firmly convinced and strongly situated. The second-class devotee, even though he cannot support his position with śāstric reference, can gradually become a first-class devotee by studying the *śāstras* and associating with a first-class devotee. However, if the second-class devotee does not advance himself by associating with a first-class devotee, he makes no progress. There is no possibility that a first-class devotee will fall down, even though he may mix with nondevotees to preach. Conviction and faith gradually increase to make one an *uttama-adhikārī,* a first-class devotee.

He is to be considered on the material platform, although he is trying to advance in devotional service. Such a person is a bhakta-prāya \[neophyte devotee\], or bhaktābhāsa, for he is a little enlightened by Vaiṣṇava philosophy.’**

He becomes a first-class devotee when, in the course of advancing in devotional service, he feels an intimate relationship with all living entities, seeing them as part and parcel of the Supreme Person.

This is a quotation from *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (3.25.21). When the sages, headed by Śaunaka, inquired about Kapiladeva, the incarnation of Godhead, Sūta Gosvāmī, who was the topmost devotee of the Lord, quoted talks about self-realization between Vidura and Maitreya, a friend of Vyāsadeva’s. During these talks the topic of Lord Kapila had come up, and at that time Maitreya had repeated Kapiladeva’s discussions with His mother, wherein the Lord states that attachment to material things is the cause of conditioned life. When a person becomes attached to transcendental things, he is on the path of liberation.

### Translation

**“ ‘By association with worldly people, one becomes devoid of truthfulness, cleanliness, mercy, gravity, spiritual intelligence, shyness, austerity, fame, forgiveness, control of the mind, control of the senses, fortune and all opportunities. One should not at any time associate with a coarse fool who is bereft of the knowledge of self-realization and who is no more than a toy animal in the hands of a woman. The illusion and bondage that accrue to a man from attachment to any other object are not as complete as that resulting from association with a woman or with men too much attached to women.’**

### Purport

These verses, quoted from *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (3.31.33-35), were spoken by Kapiladeva, an incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, to His mother. Herein Kapiladeva discusses pious and impious activities and the symptoms of those who are devoid of devotional service to Kṛṣṇa. Generally people do not know about the miserable conditions within the womb of a mother in any species of life. Due to bad association, one gradually falls into lower species. Association with women is greatly stressed in this regard. When one becomes attached to women or to those who are attached to women, one falls down into the lower species.

*puruṣaḥ prakṛti-stho hi* *bhuṅkte prakṛti-jān guṇān  
kāraṇaṁ guṇa-saṅgo ’sya* *sad-asad-yoni-janmasu*

“The living entity in material nature thus follows the ways of life, enjoying the three modes of nature. This is due to his association with that material nature. Thus he meets with good and evil among various species.” (*Bhagavad-gītā* 13.22)

According to Vedic civilization, one’s association with women should be very much restricted. In spiritual life there are four *āśramas — brahmacarya, gṛhastha, vānaprastha* and *sannyāsa.* The *brahmacārī, vānaprastha* and *sannyāsī* are completely forbidden to associate with women. Only *gṛhasthas* are allowed to associate with women under certain very much restricted conditions — that is, one associates with women to propagate nice children. Other reasons for association are condemned.

### Translation

**“ ‘The six divisions of surrender are the acceptance of those things favorable to devotional service, the rejection of unfavorable things, the conviction that Kṛṣṇa will give protection, the acceptance of the Lord as one’s guardian or master, full self-surrender, and humility.**

### Purport

One who is fully surrendered is qualified with the six following characteristics: (1) The devotee has to accept everything that is favorable for the rendering of transcendental loving service to the Lord. (2) He must reject everything unfavorable to the Lord’s service. This is also called renunciation. (3) A devotee must be firmly convinced that Kṛṣṇa will give him protection. No one else can actually give one protection, and being firmly convinced of this is called faith. This kind of faith is different from the faith of an impersonalist who wants to merge into the Brahman effulgence in order to benefit by cessation of repeated birth and death. A devotee wants to remain always in the Lord’s service. In this way, Kṛṣṇa is merciful to His devotee and gives him all protection from the dangers found on the path of devotional service. (4) The devotee should accept Kṛṣṇa as his supreme maintainer and master. He should not think that he is being protected by a demigod. He should depend only on Kṛṣṇa, considering Him the only protector. The devotee must be firmly convinced that within the three worlds he has no protector or maintainer other than Kṛṣṇa. (5) Self-surrender means remembering that one’s activities and desires are not independent. The devotee is completely dependent on Kṛṣṇa, and he acts and thinks as Kṛṣṇa desires. (6) The devotee is meek and humble.

Lord Kṛṣṇa states in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (15.15):

*sarvasya cāhaṁ hṛdi sanniviṣṭo *
 *mattaḥ smṛtir jñānam apohanaṁ ca  
vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyo *
 *vedānta-kṛd veda-vid eva cāham*

“I am seated in everyone’s heart, and from Me come remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness. By all the *Vedas* I am to be known. Indeed, I am the compiler of Vedānta, and I am the knower of the *Vedas.*” Situated in everyone’s heart, Kṛṣṇa deals differently according to the living entity’s position. The living entity’s position is to be under the protection of the illusory energy or under Kṛṣṇa’s personal protection. When a living entity is fully surrendered, he is under the direct protection of Kṛṣṇa, and Kṛṣṇa gives him all intelligence by which he can advance in spiritual realization. The nondevotee, however, being under the protection of the illusory energy, increasingly forgets his relationship with Kṛṣṇa. Sometimes it is asked how Kṛṣṇa causes one to forget. Kṛṣṇa personally causes His devotee to forget material activities, and through the agency of *māyā* Kṛṣṇa causes the nondevotee to forget his devotional service to the Lord. This is called *apohana.*

### Purport

This verse is found in the *Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu* (1.2.2). Because living entities are minute, atomic parts and parcels of the Lord, devotional service is already present within them in a dormant condition. Devotional service begins with *śravaṇaṁ kīrtanam,* hearing and chanting. When a man is sleeping, he can be awakened by sound vibration; therefore every conditioned soul should be given the chance to hear the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra* chanted by a pure Vaiṣṇava. One who hears the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra* thus vibrated is awakened to spiritual consciousness, or Kṛṣṇa consciousness. In this way one’s mind gradually becomes purified, as stated by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu (*ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam*)*.* When the mind is purified, the senses are also purified. Instead of using the senses for sense gratification, the awakened devotee employs the senses in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. This is the process by which dormant love for Kṛṣṇa is awakened.

### Translation

**“Those who have not attained the platform of spontaneous attachment in devotional service render devotional service under the guidance of a bona fide spiritual master according to the regulative principles mentioned in the revealed scriptures. According to the revealed scriptures, this kind of devotional service is called vaidhī bhakti.**

### Purport

In the beginning, one has to hear from a bona fide spiritual master. This is favorable for advancing in devotional service. According to this process, one hears, chants, remembers and engages in Deity worship, acting under the directions of the spiritual master. These are the essential primary activities of devotional service. Devotional service must not be executed for some material purpose. One should not even have a desire to merge into the Absolute Truth. One has to render such service out of love only. *Ahaitukī, apratihatā.* Devotional service must be without ulterior motives; then material conditions cannot check it. Gradually one can rise to the platform of spontaneous loving service. A child is sent to school by force to receive an education, but when he gets a little taste of education at an advanced age, he automatically participates and becomes a learned scholar. One cannot force a person to become a scholar, but sometimes force is used in the beginning. A child is forced to go to school and read and write according to the instructions of his teachers. Such is the difference between *vaidhī bhakti* and spontaneous *bhakti.* Dormant love for Kṛṣṇa exists in everyone’s heart, and it simply has to be awakened by the regulative process of devotional service. One has to learn to use a typewriter by following the regulative principles of the typing book. One has to place his fingers on the keys in such a way and practice, but when one becomes adept, he can type swiftly and correctly without even looking at the keys. Similarly, one has to follow the rules and regulations of devotional service as they are set down by the spiritual master; then one can come to the point of spontaneous loving service. This love is already there within the heart of everyone (*nitya-siddha kṛṣṇa-prema*)*.*

Spontaneous service is not artificial. One simply has to come to that platform by rendering devotional service according to the regulative principles. Thus one has to practice hearing and chanting and follow the other regulative principles by washing the temple, cleansing oneself, rising early in the morning, attending *maṅgala-ārati* and so on. If one does not come to the platform of spontaneous service in the beginning, he must adopt regulative service according to the instructions of the spiritual master. This regulative service is called *vaidhī bhakti.*

This is called *kīrtitavyaḥ.* When one hears about the Lord and glorifies Him, it is natural to think of Him. This is called *smartavyaḥ.* All this must be carried out if one actually wants to be immune from fear.

### Translation

**“ ‘Kṛṣṇa is the origin of Lord Viṣṇu. He should always be remembered and never forgotten at any time. All the rules and prohibitions mentioned in the śāstras should be the servants of these two principles.’**

### Purport

This verse is a quotation from the *Padma Purāṇa.* There are many regulative principles in the *śāstras* and directions given by the spiritual master. These regulative principles should act as servants of the basic principle — that is, one should always remember Kṛṣṇa and never forget Him. This is possible when one chants the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra.* Therefore one must strictly chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra* twenty-four hours daily. One may have other duties to perform under the direction of the spiritual master, but he must first abide by the spiritual master’s order to chant a certain number of rounds. In our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, we have recommended that the neophyte chant at least sixteen rounds. This chanting of sixteen rounds is absolutely necessary if one wants to remember Kṛṣṇa and not forget Him. Of all the regulative principles, the spiritual master’s order to chant at least sixteen rounds is most essential.

One may sell books or enlist life members or render some other service, but these duties are not ordinary duties. These duties serve as an impetus for remembering Kṛṣṇa. When one goes with a *saṅkīrtana* party or sells books, he naturally remembers that he is going to sell Kṛṣṇa’s books. In this way, he is remembering Kṛṣṇa. When one goes to enlist a life member, he talks about Kṛṣṇa and thereby remembers Him. *Smartavyaḥ satataṁ viṣṇur vismartavyo na jātucit.* The conclusion is that one must act in such a way that he will always remember Kṛṣṇa, and one must refrain from doing things that make him forget Kṛṣṇa. These two principles form the basic background of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

अवैष्णव-सङ्ग-त्याग, वहुशिष्य ना करिव ।

### Verse text

*avaiṣṇava-saṅga-tyāga, bahu-śiṣya nā kariba  
bahu-grantha-kalābhyāsa-vyākhyāna varjiba*

### Synonyms

*avaiṣṇava* — of one who is not a devotee of the Lord; *saṅga* — the association; *tyāga* — giving up; *bahu*-*śiṣya* — an unlimited number of disciples; *nā* *kariba* — should not accept; *bahu*-*grantha* — of many different types of scriptures; *kalā*-*abhyāsa* — studying a portion; *vyākhyāna* — and explanation; *varjiba* — we should give up.

### Translation

**“The twelfth item is to give up the company of nondevotees. (13) One should not accept an unlimited number of disciples. (14) One should not partially study many scriptures just to be able to give references and expand explanations.**

### Purport

Accepting an unlimited number of devotees or disciples is very risky for one who is not a preacher. According to Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī, a preacher has to accept many disciples to expand the cult of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. This is risky because when a spiritual master accepts a disciple, he naturally accepts the disciple’s sinful activities and their reactions. Unless he is very powerful, he cannot assimilate all the sinful reactions of his disciples and has to suffer the consequences. Therefore one is generally forbidden to accept many disciples.

One should not partially study a book just to pose oneself as a great scholar by being able to refer to scriptures. In our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement we have therefore limited our study of the Vedic literatures to the *Bhagavad-gītā, Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, Caitanya-caritāmṛta* and *Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu.* These four works are sufficient for preaching purposes. They are adequate for the understanding of the philosophy and the spreading of missionary activities all over the world. If one studies a particular book, he must do so thoroughly. That is the principle. By thoroughly studying a limited number of books, one can understand the philosophy.

### Purport

Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura points out that there are thirty-five items up to the point of observing special vows in the month of Kārttika. To these thirty-five items, another four are added — namely marking *tilaka* on different parts of the body, writing the names of the Lord all over the body, accepting the Deity’s garland and accepting *caraṇāmṛta.* These four items are understood to be included by Kavirāja Gosvāmī within *arcana,* worship of the Deity. Although these items are not mentioned here, they are to be added to the previous thirty-five items. Thus the total number becomes thirty-nine. To these thirty-nine should be added five others: association with devotees, chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra,* reading *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* regularly, residing in Mathurā, the birthplace of Kṛṣṇa, and worshiping the Deity with great respect and veneration. The thirty-nine items plus these five come to a total of forty-four. If we add the previous twenty items to these forty-four, the total number becomes sixty-four. The five items mentioned above repeat previously mentioned items. In the *Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu,* Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī states:

*aṅgānāṁ pañcakasyāsya* *pūrva-vilikhitasya ca  
nikhila-śraiṣṭhya-bodhāya* *punar apy atra śaṁsanam*

“The glorification of these five items \[association with devotees, chanting the holy name and so on\] is to make known the complete superiority of these five practices of devotional service.”

The sixty-four items of devotional service include all the activities of the body, mind and senses. Thus the sixty-four items engage one in devotional service in all respects.

### Synonyms

*śrīmad*-*bhāgavata* — of the *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam*; *arthānām* — of the meanings; *āsvādaḥ* — enjoying the taste; *rasikaiḥ* *saha* — with the devotees; *sa*-*jātīya* — similar; *āśaye* — endowed with a desire; *snigdhe* — advanced in devotional affection; *sādhau* — with a devotee; *saṅgaḥ* — association; *svataḥ* — for one’s self; *vare* — better.

### Translation

**“ ‘One should taste the meaning of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam in the association of pure devotees, and one should associate with the devotees who are more advanced than oneself and who are endowed with a similar type of affection for the Lord.**

### Purport

The words *sajātīyāśaye snigdhe sādhau saṅgaḥ svato vare* are very important. One should not associate with professional *Bhāgavatam* reciters. A professional *Bhāgavatam* reciter is one who is not in the disciplic succession or one who has no taste for *bhakti-yoga.* Simply on the strength of grammatical knowledge and word jugglery, professional reciters maintain their bodies and their desires for sense gratification by reading *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.* One should also avoid those who are averse to Lord Viṣṇu and His devotees, those who are Māyāvādīs, those who offend the chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra,* those who simply dress as Vaiṣṇavas or so-called *gosvāmīs,* and those who make a business by selling Vedic *mantras* and reciting *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* to maintain their families. One should not try to understand *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* from such materialistic people. According to the Vedic injunctions, *yasya deve parā bhaktiḥ.* The *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* can be recited only by one who has unflinching faith in the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa and His devotee, the spiritual master. One should try to understand *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* from the spiritual master. The Vedic injunction states, *bhaktyā bhāgavataṁ grāhyaṁ na buddhyā na ca ṭīkayā.* One has to understand *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* through the process of devotional service and by hearing the recitation of a pure devotee. These are the injunctions of the Vedic literature — *śruti* and *smṛti.* Those who are not in the disciplic succession and who are not pure devotees cannot understand the real mysterious objective of *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* and *Śrīmad Bhagavad-gītā.*

### Synonyms

*nāma*-*saṅkīrtanam* — chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra*; *śrīman*-*mathurā*-*maṇḍale* — in Mathurā, where Kṛṣṇa specifically performs His pastimes; *sthitiḥ* — residence.

### Translation

**“ ‘One should congregationally chant the holy name of the Lord and reside in Vṛndāvana.’**

### Purport

Śrīla Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura has sung:

*śrī gauḍa-maṇḍala-bhūmi,* *yeba jāne cintāmaṇi,  
tāra haya vrajabhūmi vāsa*

“One who understands the transcendental nature of Navadvīpa and its surrounding area, where Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu enacted His pastimes, resides always in Vṛndāvana.” Similarly, living in Jagannātha Purī is as good as living in Vṛndāvana. The conclusion is that Navadvīpa-dhāma, Jagannātha Purī-dhāma and Vṛndāvana-dhāma are identical.

However, if one goes to Mathurā-maṇḍala-bhūmi for sense gratification or to make a livelihood, he commits an offense and is condemned. Whoever does so must be penalized in the next life by becoming a hog or a monkey in Vṛndāvana-dhāma. After taking on such a body, the offender is liberated in the next life. Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura remarks that residing in Vṛndāvana with a view to enjoy sense gratification surely leads a so-called devotee to a lower species.

### Translation

**“ ‘Mahārāja Ambarīṣa always engaged his mind at the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, his words in describing the spiritual world and the Supreme Personality of Godhead, his hands in cleansing and washing the Lord’s temple, his ears in hearing topics about the Supreme Lord, his eyes in seeing the Deity of Lord Kṛṣṇa in the temple, his body in embracing Vaiṣṇavas or touching their lotus feet, his nostrils in smelling the aroma of the tulasī leaves offered to Kṛṣṇa’s lotus feet, his tongue in tasting food offered to Kṛṣṇa, his legs in going to places of pilgrimage like Vṛndāvana and Mathurā or to the Lord’s temple, his head in touching the lotus feet of the Lord and offering Him obeisances, and his desires in serving the Lord faithfully. In this way Mahārāja Ambarīṣa engaged his senses in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. As a result, he awakened his dormant loving propensity for the Lord’s service.’**

### Verse text

*kāma tyaji’ kṛṣṇa bhaje śāstra-ājñā māni’  
deva-ṛṣi-pitrādikera kabhu nahe ṛṇī*

### Synonyms

*kāma* — material desires; *tyaji’* — giving up; *kṛṣṇa* — Lord Kṛṣṇa; *bhaje* — worships; *śāstra*-*ājñā* — the direction of the revealed scripture; *māni’* — accepting; *deva* — demigods; *ṛṣi* — great sages; *pitṛ*-*ādikera* — of the forefathers and so on; *kabhu* — at any time; *nahe* — not; *ṛṇī* — a debtor.

### Translation

**“If a person gives up all material desires and completely engages in the transcendental loving service of Kṛṣṇa, as enjoined in the revealed scriptures, he is never indebted to the demigods, sages or forefathers.**

### Purport

After birth, every man is indebted in so many ways. He is indebted to the demigods for their supplying necessities like air, light and water. When one takes advantage of the Vedic literatures, one becomes indebted to great sages like Vyāsadeva, Nārada, Devala and Asita. When one takes birth in a particular family, he becomes indebted to his forefathers. We are even indebted to common living entities like cows, from whom we take milk. Because we accept service from so many animals, we become indebted. However, if one is completely engaged in the Lord’s devotional service, he is absolved of all debts. This is confirmed in the following verse, quoted from *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (11.5.41).

### Purport

It is said:

*adhyāpanaṁ brahma-yajñaḥ* *pitṛ-yajñas tu tarpaṇam  
homo daivo balir bhauto* *nṛ-yajño ’tithi-pūjanam*

“By offering oblations with ghee, one satisfies the demigods. By studying the *Vedas,* one performs *brahma-yajña,* which satisfies the great sages. Offering libations of water before one’s forefathers is called *pitṛ-yajña.* By offering tribute, one performs *bhūta-yajña.* By properly receiving guests, one performs *nṛ-yajña*.” These are the five *yajñas* that liquidate the five kinds of indebtedness — indebtedness to the demigods, great sages, forefathers, living entities and common men. Therefore one has to perform these five kinds of *yajñas.* But when one takes to the *saṅkīrtana-yajña* (the chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra*), one does not have to perform any other *yajña.* In *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,* Nārada Muni made a statement about the systematic performance of *bhāgavata-dharma* in connection with statements previously made by the nine Yogendras before Mahārāja Nimi. The sage Karabhājana Ṛṣi explained the four incarnations of the four *yugas,* and at the end, in this verse (text 141), he explained the position of Kṛṣṇa’s pure devotee and how he is absolved of all debts.

*vidhi-dharma chāḍi’ bhaje kṛṣṇera caraṇa  
niṣiddha pāpācāre tāra kabhu nahe mana*

### Synonyms

*vidhi*-*dharma* *chāḍi’* — giving up all regulative principles of the *varṇa* and *āśrama* institution; *bhaje* — worships; *kṛṣṇera* *caraṇa* — the lotus feet of Lord Kṛṣṇa; *niṣiddha* — forbidden; *pāpa*-*ācāre* — in sinful activities; *tāra* — his; *kabhu* — at any time; *nahe* — not; *mana* — the mind.

### Translation

**“Although the pure devotee does not follow all the regulative principles of varṇāśrama, he worships the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa. Therefore he naturally has no tendency to commit sin.**

### Purport

The *varṇāśrama* institution is planned in such a way that one will not commit sinful activities. Material existence continues due to sinful activity. When one acts sinfully in this life, he gets a suitable body for the next life. When one again acts sinfully, he takes on another material body. In this way one is continuously under the influence of material nature.

*puruṣaḥ prakṛti-stho hi* *bhuṅkte prakṛti-jān guṇān  
kāraṇaṁ guṇa-saṅgo ’sya* *sad-asad-yoni-janmasu*

“The living entity in material nature thus follows the ways of life, enjoying the three modes of material nature. This is due to his association with that material nature. Thus he meets with good and evil among various species.” (Bg. 13.22)

Due to our association with the modes of material nature, we get different types of bodies, good and bad. One cannot be liberated from the cycle of birth and death, known as transmigration of the soul, unless one is completely freed from all sinful activities. The best process, therefore, is to take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. One cannot take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness without being freed from all sinful activities. Naturally one who is very serious about Kṛṣṇa consciousness is freed from all sinful activity. Consequently a devotee is never inclined to commit sins. If one is pressured by the law or obligations to give up sinful activity, one cannot do so. However, if one takes to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he can very easily give up all sinful activity. This is confirmed herein.

### Translation

**“The path of speculative knowledge and renunciation is not essential for devotional service. Indeed, good qualities such as nonviolence and control of the mind and senses automatically accompany a devotee of Lord Kṛṣṇa.**

### Purport

Sometimes a neophyte devotee or ordinary person thinks highly of speculative knowledge, austerity, penances and renunciation, thinking them the only path for advancement in devotional service. Actually this is not a fact. The path of knowledge, mystic *yoga* and renunciation has nothing to do with the pure soul. When one is temporarily in the material world, such processes may help a little, but they are not necessary for a pure devotee of Kṛṣṇa. In the material world, such activities end in material enjoyment or merging into the effulgence of the Supreme. They have nothing to do with the eternal loving service of the Lord. If one abandons speculative knowledge and simply engages in devotional service, he has attained his perfection. The devotee has no need for speculative knowledge, pious activity or mystic *yoga.* All these are automatically present when one renders the Lord transcendental loving service.

### Translation

**“ ‘For one who is fully engaged in My devotional service, whose mind is fixed on Me in bhakti-yoga, the path of speculative knowledge and dry renunciation is not very beneficial.’**

### Purport

The path of devotional service is always independent of other activity. The path of speculative knowledge and mystic *yoga* may be a little beneficial in the beginning, but it cannot be considered part of devotional service. This verse (*Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* 11.20.31) was spoken by Lord Kṛṣṇa when He was speaking to Uddhava before His departure from this material world. These are important instructions given directly by Lord Kṛṣṇa. Śrī Uddhava asked the Lord about the two kinds of instructions given in the *Vedas.* One instruction is called *pravṛtti-mārga,* and the other is called *nivṛtti-mārga.* These are directions for enjoying the material world according to regulative principles and then giving up the material world for higher spiritual understanding. Sometimes one does not know whether to practice speculative knowledge and mystic *yoga* for advancement in spiritual knowledge. Kṛṣṇa explains to Uddhava that the mechanical process of speculative knowledge and *yoga* is not necessary for advancing in devotional service. Devotional service is completely spiritual; it has nothing to do with material things. It is awakened by hearing and chanting in the association of devotees. Because devotional service is always transcendental, it has nothing to do with material activity.

### Translation

**“If one follows in the footsteps of the inhabitants of Vṛndāvana out of such transcendental covetousness, he does not care for the injunctions or reasonings of śāstra. That is the way of spontaneous love.**

### Purport

Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura says that a devotee is attracted by the service of the inhabitants of Vṛndāvana — namely the cowherd men, Mahārāja Nanda, mother Yaśodā, Rādhārāṇī, the *gopīs* and the cows and calves. An advanced devotee is attracted by the service rendered by an eternal servitor of the Lord. This attraction is called spontaneous attraction. Technically it is called *svarūpa-upalabdhi.* This stage is not achieved in the beginning. In the beginning one has to render service strictly according to the regulative principles set forth by the revealed scriptures and the spiritual master. By continuously rendering service through the process of *vaidhī bhakti,* one’s natural inclination is gradually awakened. That is called spontaneous attraction, or *rāgānugā bhakti.*

An advanced devotee situated on the platform of spontaneity is already very expert in śāstric instruction, logic and argument. When he comes to the point of eternal love for Kṛṣṇa, no one can deviate him from that position, neither by argument nor by śāstric evidence. An advanced devotee has realized his eternal relationship with the Lord, and consequently he does not accept the logic and arguments of others. Such an advanced devotee has nothing to do with the *sahajiyās,* who manufacture their own way and commit sins by indulging in illicit sex, intoxication and gambling, if not meat-eating. Sometimes the *sahajiyās* imitate advanced devotees and live in their own whimsical way, avoiding the principles set down in the revealed scriptures. Unless one follows the six Gosvāmīs — Śrī Rūpa, Sanātana, Raghunātha Bhaṭṭa, Śrī Jīva, Gopāla Bhaṭṭa and Raghunātha dāsa — one cannot be a bona fide spontaneous lover of Kṛṣṇa. In this connection, Śrīla Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura says, *rūpa-raghunātha-pade haibe ākuti kabe hāma bujhaba se yugala pirīti.* The *sahajiyās’* understanding of the love affairs between Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa is not bona fide because they do not follow the principles laid down by the six Gosvāmīs. Their illicit connection and their imitation of the dress of Rūpa Gosvāmī, as well as their avoidance of the prescribed methods of revealed scriptures, will lead them to the lowest regions of hell. These imitative *sahajiyās* are cheated and unfortunate. They are not equal to advanced devotees (*paramahaṁsas*)*.* Debauchees and *paramahaṁsas* are not on the same level.

Indeed, he begins to covet that particular type of devotion.

### Purport

Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura comments on this verse. Externally a devotee performs all the items of devotional service in nine different ways, beginning with *śravaṇa* and *kīrtana,* and within his mind he always thinks of his eternal relationship with Kṛṣṇa and follows in the footsteps of the devotees of Vṛndāvana. If one engages himself in the service of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa in this way, he can transcend the regulative principles enjoined in the *śāstras* and, through his spiritual master, fully engage in rendering spontaneous love to Kṛṣṇa. In this way, he attains affection at the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa actually comes under the control of such spontaneous feelings, and ultimately one can attain association with the Lord.
