CHAPTER THIRTEEN

A summary of this chapter is given by Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura in his *Amṛta-pravāha-bhāṣya* as follows. After bathing early in the morning, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu saw the deities (Jagannātha, Baladeva and Subhadrā) get aboard their three cars. This function is called Pāṇḍu-vijaya. At that time, King Pratāparudra took a broom with a golden handle and began to cleanse the road. Lord Jagannātha took permission from the goddess of fortune and then started in the car for the Guṇḍicā temple. The road to the temple led along a broad, sandy beach, and on both sides of the road were residential quarters, houses and gardens. Along that road the servants called *gauḍas* began to pull the cars. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu divided His *saṅkīrtana* party into seven divisions. With two *mṛdaṅgas* in each division, there were altogether fourteen *mṛdaṅgas.* While performing *kīrtana,* Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu exhibited various symptoms of transcendental ecstasy, and Jagannātha and Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu exchanged Their feelings very blissfully. When the cars reached the place known as Balagaṇḍi, the devotees offered the deities simple food. At this time, in a nearby garden, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and His devotees took a brief rest from the dancing.

### Purport

The word *dayitā* refers to one who has received the mercy of the Lord. Lord Jagannātha has a number of stalwart servants known as *dayitās.* These servants do not come from very high-caste families (*brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas* or *vaiśyas*), but because they are engaged in the service of the Lord, they have been elevated to a respected position. Thus they are known as *dayitās.* These servants of Lord Jagannātha take care of the Lord from the day of the Snāna-yātrā up to the time the Lord is carried from the throne to the Ratha car. In the *Kṣetra-māhātmya* these *dayitās* are said to come from the *śabaras,* a caste that keeps and sells pigs. However, among the *dayitās* there are also many who come from the *brāhmaṇa* caste. Those *dayitās* coming from the *brāhmaṇa* families are called *dayitā-patis,* or leaders of the *dayitās.* The *dayitā-patis* offer food such as sweetmeats to Lord Jagannātha during the *anavasara,* the resting period after Snāna-yātrā. They also make the early-morning offering of sweetmeats daily. It is said that during the *anavasara* Lord Jagannātha suffers from fever and that the *dayitā-patis* offer Him an infusion of drugs represented by fruit juice. It is said that in the beginning Lord Jagannātha was worshiped by the *śabaras* and was known as the Deity Nīla Mādhava. Later, when the Deity was established in the temple, the Lord became known as Jagannātha. Because the Deities were taken from the *śabaras,* all the *śabara* devotees were elevated to the position of *dayitās.*

महाप्रभुर कृपा हैल से-सेवा हइते ॥ १८ ॥

### Verse text

*mahāprabhu sukha pāila se-sevā dekhite  
mahāprabhura kṛpā haila se-sevā ha-ite*

### Synonyms

*mahāprabhu* — Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu; *sukha* *pāila* — felt very happy; *se*-*sevā* — that kind of service; *dekhite* — to see; *mahāprabhura* — of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu; *kṛpā* — mercy; *haila* — there was; *se*-*sevā* *ha*-*ite* — because of that service.

### Translation

**Upon seeing the King engaged in such menial service, Caitanya Mahāprabhu became very happy. Simply by rendering this service, the King received the mercy of the Lord.**

### Purport

Unless one receives the mercy of the Lord, he cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead or engage in His devotional service.

*athāpi te deva padāmbuja-dvaya- *
 *prasāda-leśānugṛhīta eva hi  
jānāti tattvaṁ bhagavan-mahimno *
 *na cānya eko ’pi ciraṁ vicinvan*

(*Bhāg.* 10.14.29)

A devotee who has received even a small fraction of the mercy of the Lord can understand Him. Others may engage in theoretical speculation to understand the Lord, but they cannot know anything about Him. Although Mahārāja Pratāparudra was very eager to see Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, the Lord refused to see him. But when Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu saw the King engaged in menial service for Lord Jagannātha, He became very happy. Thus the King became eligible to receive Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s mercy. If a devotee accepts Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu as the universal *guru* and Lord Jagannātha as the Supreme Personality of Godhead Kṛṣṇa, he is benefited by the combined mercy of Kṛṣṇa and *guru.* That is stated by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu in His instructions to Rūpa Gosvāmī (Cc. *Madhya* 19.151):

*brahmāṇḍa bhramite kona bhāgyavān jīva  
guru-kṛṣṇa-prasāde pāya bhakti-latā-bīja*

The seed of devotional service fructifies and becomes a transcendental creeper. Finally it reaches the lotus feet of the Lord in the spiritual sky. This seed is obtained by the mercy of the Lord and the *guru.* By the Lord’s mercy one gets the association of a bona fide *guru,* and by the mercy of the *guru* one gets a chance to render devotional service. Devotional service, the science of *bhakti-yoga,* carries one from this material world to the spiritual world.

Just as the residents of Purī compared the Ratha-yātrā car to Mount Sumeru, the residents of London considered the car rival to the Nelson Monument.

### Translation

**Having taken permission from the goddess of fortune, the Lord came out to ride on the Ratha car and perform His pastimes for the pleasure of the devotees.**

### Purport

In this connection, Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura comments that as an ideal husband, Lord Jagannātha remained fifteen days in a secluded place with His wife, the supreme goddess of fortune. Nonetheless, the Lord wanted to come out of seclusion to give happiness to His devotees. The Lord enjoys Himself in two ways, known as *svakīya* and *parakīya.* The Lord’s conjugal love in the *svakīya-rasa* relates to the regulative principles observed in Dvārakā, where the Lord has many married queens. But in Vṛndāvana the conjugal love of the Lord is not with His married wives but with His girlfriends, the *gopīs.* Conjugal love with the *gopīs* is called *parakīya-rasa.* Lord Jagannātha leaves the secluded place where He enjoys the company of the supreme goddess of fortune in *svakīya-rasa,* and He goes to Vṛndāvana, where He enjoys the *parakīya-rasa.* Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura therefore reminds us that the Lord’s pleasure in *parakīya-rasa* is superior to His pleasure in *svakīya-rasa.*

In the material world, *parakīya-rasa,* or loving affairs with unmarried girlfriends, is the most degraded relationship, but in the spiritual world this type of loving affair is considered the supreme enjoyment. In the material world everything is but a reflection of the spiritual world, and that reflection is perverted. We cannot understand the affairs of the spiritual world on the basis of our experience in the material world. The Lord’s pastimes with the *gopīs* are therefore misunderstood by mundane scholars and word-wranglers. The *parakīya-rasa* of the spiritual world should not be discussed except by one who is very advanced in pure devotional service. The *parakīya-rasa* in the spiritual world and that in the material world are not comparable. The former is like gold, and the latter is like iron. Because the difference between the two is so great, they cannot actually be compared. However, just as a knowledgeable person can easily distinguish gold from iron, one who has the proper realization can easily distinguish the transcendental activities of the spiritual world from material activities.

### Purport

The mystery of the Lord’s activities is described by Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura. Lord Jagannātha was astonished to see the transcendental dancing and chanting of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and He stopped His car just to see the dancing. Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu then danced in such a mystical way that He pleased Lord Jagannātha. The seer and the dancer were one and the same Supreme Person, but the Lord, being one and many at the same time, was exhibiting the variegatedness of His pastimes. This is the meaning behind His mysterious exhibition. By the mercy of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, the King could understand how the two of Them were enjoying each other’s activities. Another mysterious exhibition was Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s simultaneous presence in seven groups. By the mercy of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, the King could understand that also.

### Translation

**Although the King had been refused an interview, he was indirectly bestowed causeless mercy. Who can understand the internal potency of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu?**

### Purport

As Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was playing the part of a world teacher, He did not agree to see the King, because a king is a mundane person interested in money and women. Indeed, the very word “king” suggests one who is always surrounded by money and women. As a *sannyāsī,* Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was afraid of both money and women. The very word “king” is repugnant to one who is in the renounced order of life. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu refused to see the King, but indirectly, by the Lord’s causeless mercy, the King was able to understand the Lord’s mysterious activities. Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s activities were exhibited sometimes to reveal Him as the Supreme Personality of Godhead and sometimes to show Him as a devotee. Both kinds of activities are mysterious and appreciated only by pure devotees.

### Translation

**Indeed, the Personality of Godhead forgot Himself in the course of His transcendental pastimes, but His internal potency \[līlā-śakti\], knowing the intentions of the Lord, made all arrangements.**

### Purport

It is stated in the *Upaniṣads:*

*parāsya śaktir vividhaiva śrūyate *
 *svābhāvikī jñāna-bala-kriyā ca*

“The Supreme Lord has multipotencies, which act so perfectly that all consciousness, strength and activity are being directed solely by His will.” (*Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad* 6.8)

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu exhibited His mystic power in presenting Himself simultaneously in each and every *saṅkīrtana* group. Most people thought that He was one, but some saw that He was many. The internal devotees could understand that the Lord, although one, was exhibiting Himself as many in the different *saṅkīrtana* groups. When Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu danced, He forgot Himself and was simply absorbed in ecstatic bliss. But His internal potency arranged everything perfectly. This is the difference between the internal and external potency. In the material world, the external potency (material energy) can act only after one endeavors at great length, but when the Supreme Lord desires, everything is performed automatically by the internal potency. By His will, things happen so nicely and perfectly that they appear to be carried out automatically. Sometimes the activities of the internal potency are exhibited in the material world. In fact, all the activities of material nature are actually performed by the inconceivable energies of the Lord, but so-called scientists and students of material nature are unable to understand ultimately how things are happening. They evasively conclude that everything is being done by nature, but they do not know that behind nature is the potent Supreme Personality of Godhead. Lord Kṛṣṇa explains this in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (9.10):

*mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ* *sūyate sa-carācaram  
hetunānena kaunteya* *jagad viparivartate*

“This material nature, which is one of My energies, is working under My direction, O son of Kuntī, producing all moving and nonmoving beings. Under its rule this manifestation is created and annihilated again and again.”

### Purport

Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa expanded Himself into many forms while engaged in the *rāsa-līlā* dance, and He also expanded Himself when He married 16,000 wives in Dvārakā. The same process was adopted by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu when He expanded Himself into seven forms to dance in each and every group of the *saṅkīrtana* party. These expansions were appreciated by pure devotees, including King Pratāparudra. Although for reasons of external formality Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu refused to see King Pratāparudra because he was a king, King Pratāparudra became one of the Lord’s most confidential devotees by the Lord’s special mercy upon him. The King could see Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu simultaneously present in all seven groups. As confirmed in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,* one cannot see the expansions of the transcendental forms of the Lord unless one is a pure devotee of the Lord.

### Purport

In his *Anubhāṣya,* Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura describes the ecstasy of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu as follows. After giving up the company of the *gopīs* in Vṛndāvana, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the son of Mahārāja Nanda, engaged in His pastimes at Dvārakā. When Kṛṣṇa went to Kurukṣetra with His brother and sister and others from Dvārakā, He again met the inhabitants of Vṛndāvana. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is *rādhā-bhāva-dyuti-suvalita,* that is, Kṛṣṇa Himself assuming the part of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī in order to understand Kṛṣṇa. Lord Jagannātha-deva is Kṛṣṇa, and Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya Mahāprabhu is Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī. Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s leading Lord Jagannātha toward the Guṇḍicā temple corresponded to Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī’s leading Kṛṣṇa toward Vṛndāvana. Śrī Kṣetra, Jagannātha Purī, was taken as the kingdom of Dvārakā, the place where Kṛṣṇa enjoys supreme opulence. But He was being led by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu to Vṛndāvana, the simple village where all the inhabitants are filled with ecstatic love for Kṛṣṇa. Śrī Kṣetra is a place of *aiśvarya-līlā,* just as Vṛndāvana is the place of *mādhurya-līlā.* Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s following at the rear of the *ratha* indicated that Lord Jagannātha, Kṛṣṇa, was forgetting the inhabitants of Vṛndāvana. Although Kṛṣṇa neglected the inhabitants of Vṛndāvana, He could not forget them. Thus in His opulent Ratha-yātrā, He was returning to Vṛndāvana. In the role of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was examining whether the Lord still remembered the inhabitants of Vṛndāvana. When Caitanya Mahāprabhu fell behind the Ratha car, Jagannātha-deva, Kṛṣṇa Himself, understood the mind of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī. Therefore, Jagannātha sometimes fell behind the dancing Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu to indicate to Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī that He had not forgotten. Thus Lord Jagannātha would stop the forward march of the *ratha* and wait at a standstill. In this way Lord Jagannātha agreed that without the ecstasy of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī He could not feel satisfied. While Jagannātha was thus waiting, Gaurasundara, Caitanya Mahāprabhu, in His ecstasy of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī, immediately came forward to Kṛṣṇa. At such times, Lord Jagannātha would proceed ahead very slowly. These competitive exchanges were all part of the love affair between Kṛṣṇa and Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī. In that competition between Lord Caitanya’s ecstasy for Jagannātha and Jagannātha’s ecstasy for Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī, Caitanya Mahāprabhu emerged successful.

आहुश्च ते नलिन-नाभ पदारविन्दं  
योगेश्वरैर्हृदि विचिन्त्यमगाधवोधैः ।  
संसारकूपपतितोत्तरणावलम्वं  
गेहं जुषामपि मनस्युदिय़ात् सदा नः ॥ १३६ ॥

### Verse text

*āhuś ca te nalina-nābha padāravindaṁ  
yogeśvarair hṛdi vicintyam agādha-bodhaiḥ  
saṁsāra-kūpa-patitottaraṇāvalambaṁ  
gehaṁ juṣām api manasy udiyāt sadā naḥ*

### Synonyms

*āhuḥ* — the *gopīs* said; *ca* — and; *te* — Your; *nalina*-*nābha* — O Lord, whose navel is just like a lotus flower; *pada*-*aravindam* — lotus feet; *yoga*-*īśvaraiḥ* — by great mystic *yogīs*; *hṛdi* — within the heart; *vicintyam* — to be meditated upon; *agādha*-*bodhaiḥ* — who are highly learned philosophers; *saṁsāra*-*kūpa* — in the dark well of material existence; *patita* — of those fallen; *uttaraṇa* — for deliverance; *avalambam* — the only shelter; *geham* — in family affairs; *juṣām* — of those engaged; *api* — although; *manasi* — in the minds; *udiyāt* — let be awakened; *sadā* — always; *naḥ* — our.

### Translation

**“\[The gopīs spoke thus:\] ‘Dear Lord, whose navel is just like a lotus flower, Your lotus feet are the only shelter for those who have fallen into the deep well of material existence. Your feet are worshiped and meditated upon by great mystic yogīs and highly learned philosophers. We wish that these lotus feet may also be awakened within our hearts, although we are only ordinary persons engaged in household affairs.’ ”**

### Purport

This is a quotation from *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (10.82.48). The *gopīs* were never interested in *karma-yoga, jñāna-yoga* or *dhyāna-yoga.* They were simply interested in *bhakti-yoga.* Unless they were forced, they never liked to meditate on the lotus feet of the Lord. Rather, they preferred to take the lotus feet of the Lord and place them on their breasts. Sometimes they regretted that their breasts were so hard, fearing that Kṛṣṇa might not be very pleased to keep His soft lotus feet there. When those lotus feet were pricked by the grains of sand in the Vṛndāvana pasturing ground, the *gopīs* were pained and began to cry. The *gopīs* wanted to keep Kṛṣṇa at home always, and in this way their minds were absorbed in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Such pure Kṛṣṇa consciousness can arise only in Vṛndāvana. Thus Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu began to explain His own mind, which was saturated in the ecstasy of the *gopīs.*

### Verse text

‘mane’ ‘vane’ eka kari’ jāni  
tāhāṅ tomāra pada-dvaya,* *karāha yadi udaya,

### Synonyms

*anyera* — of others; *hṛdaya* — consciousness; *mana* — mind; *mora* *mana* — My mind; *vṛndāvana* — Vṛndāvana consciousness; *mane* — with the mind; *vane* — with Vṛndāvana; *eka* *kari’* — as one and the same; *jāni* — I know; *tāhāṅ* — there, at Vṛndāvana; *tomāra* — Your; *pada*-*dvaya* — two lotus feet; *karāha* — You do; *yadi* — if; *udaya* — appearance; *tabe* — then; *tomāra* — Your; *pūrṇa* — complete; *kṛpā* — mercy; *māni* — I accept.

### Translation

**Speaking in the mood of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī, Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, “For most people, the mind and heart are one, but because My mind is never separated from Vṛndāvana, I consider My mind and Vṛndāvana to be one. My mind is already Vṛndāvana, and since You like Vṛndāvana, will You please place Your lotus feet there? I would deem that Your full mercy.**

### Purport

The mind’s activities are thinking, feeling and willing, by which the mind accepts materially favorable things and rejects the unfavorable. This is the consciousness of people in general. But when one’s mind does not accept and reject but simply becomes fixed on the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, then one’s mind becomes as good as Vṛndāvana. Wherever Kṛṣṇa is, there also are Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī, the *gopīs,* the cowherd boys and all the other inhabitants of Vṛndāvana. Thus as soon as one fixes Kṛṣṇa in his mind, his mind becomes identical with Vṛndāvana. In other words, when one’s mind is completely free from all material desires and is engaged only in the service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, then one always lives in Vṛndāvana, and nowhere else.

### Verse text

*prāṇa-nātha, śuna mora satya nivedana  
vraja — āmāra sadana,* *tāhāṅ tomāra saṅgama,  
nā pāile nā rahe jīvana*

### Synonyms

*prāṇa*-*nātha* — O My Lord, master of My life; *śuna* — please hear; *mora* — My; *satya* — true; *nivedana* — submission; *vraja* — Vṛndāvana; *āmāra* — My; *sadana* — place; *tāhāṅ* — there; *tomāra* — Your; *saṅgama* — association; *nā* *pāile* — if I do not get; *nā* — not; *rahe* — does remain; *jīvana* — life.

### Translation

**“My dear Lord, kindly hear My true submission. My home is Vṛndāvana, and I wish Your association there. But if I do not get it, then it will be very difficult for Me to keep My life.**

### Purport

Only when the mind is free from designations can one desire the association of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The mind must have some occupation. If a person is to be free of material things, his mind cannot be vacant; there must be subject matters for thinking, feeling and willing. Unless one’s mind is filled with thoughts of Kṛṣṇa, feelings for Kṛṣṇa and a desire to serve Kṛṣṇa, the mind will be filled with material activities. Those who have given up all material activities and have ceased thinking of them should always retain the ambition to think of Kṛṣṇa. Without Kṛṣṇa, one cannot live, just as a person cannot live without some enjoyment for his mind.

### Synonyms

*pūrve* — previously; *uddhava*-*dvāre* — through Uddhava; *ebe* — now; *sākṣāt* — directly; *āmāre* — unto Me; *yoga* — mystic yogic meditation; *jñāne* — philosophical speculation; *kahilā* — You have said; *upāya* — the means; *tumi* — You; *vidagdha* — very humorous; *kṛpā*-*maya* — merciful; *jānaha* — You know; *āmāra* — My; *hṛdaya* — mind; *more* — unto Me; *aiche* — in that way; *kahite* — to speak; *nā* *yuyāya* — is not at all befitting.

### Translation

**“My dear Kṛṣṇa, formerly, when You were staying in Mathurā, You sent Uddhava to teach Me speculative knowledge and mystic yoga. Now You Yourself are speaking the same thing, but My mind doesn’t accept it. There is no place in My mind for jñāna-yoga or dhyāna-yoga. Although You know Me very well, You are still instructing Me in jñāna-yoga and dhyāna-yoga. It is not right for You to do so.”**

### Purport

The process of mystic *yoga,* the speculative method for searching out the Supreme Absolute Truth, does not appeal to one who is always absorbed in thoughts of Kṛṣṇa. A devotee is not at all interested in speculative activities. Instead of cultivating speculative knowledge or practicing mystic *yoga,* a devotee should worship the Deity in the temple and continuously engage in the Lord’s service. Temple Deity worship is realized by the devotees to be the same as direct service to the Lord. The Deity is known as the *arcā-vigraha* or *arcā-avatāra,* an incarnation of the Supreme Lord in the form of a material manifestation (brass, stone or wood). Ultimately there is no difference between Kṛṣṇa manifest in matter or Kṛṣṇa manifest in spirit because both are His energies. For Kṛṣṇa, there is no distinction between matter and spirit. His manifestation in material form, therefore, is as good as His original form, *sac-cid-ānanda-vigraha.* A devotee constantly engaged in Deity worship according to the rules and regulations laid down in the *śāstras* and given by the spiritual master realizes gradually that he is in direct contact with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus he loses all interest in so-called meditation, *yoga* practice and mental speculation.

### Synonyms

*citta* *kāḍhi’* — withdrawing the consciousness; *tomā* *haite* — from You; *viṣaye* — in mundane subject matters; *cāhi* — I want; *lāgāite* — to engage; *yatna* *kari* — I endeavor; *nāri* *kāḍhibāre* — I cannot withdraw; *tāre* — to such a servant; *dhyāna* — of meditation; *śikṣā* — instruction; *karāha* — You give; *loka* — people in general; *hāsāñā* — laugh; *māra* — You kill; *sthāna*-*asthāna* — proper or improper place; *nā* *kara* — You do not make; *vicāre* — consideration.

### Translation

**Caitanya Mahāprabhu continued, “I would like to withdraw My consciousness from You and engage it in material activities, but even though I try, I cannot do so. I am naturally inclined to You only. Your instructions for Me to meditate on You are therefore simply ludicrous. In this way, You are killing Me. It is not very good for You to think of Me as a candidate for Your instructions.**

### Purport

Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī says in his *Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu* (1.1.11):

*anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyaṁ* *jñāna-karmādy-anāvṛtam  
ānakūlyena kṛṣṇānu-* *śīlanaṁ bhaktir uttamā*

For a pure devotee, there is no scope for indulgence in mystic *yoga* practice or the cultivation of speculative philosophy. It is indeed impossible for a pure devotee to engage his mind in such unwanted activities. Even if a pure devotee wanted to, his mind would not allow him to do so. That is a characteristic of a pure devotee — he is transcendental to all fruitive activity, speculative philosophy and mystic *yoga* meditation. The *gopīs* therefore expressed themselves as follows.

### Verse text

*nahe gopī yogeśvara,* *pada-kamala tomāra,  
dhyāna kari’ pāibe santoṣa  
tomāra vākya-paripāṭī,* *tāra madhye kuṭināṭī,  
śuni’ gopīra āro bāḍhe roṣa*

### Synonyms

*nahe* — not; *gopī* — *gopīs*; *yogeśvara* — masters of mystic *yoga* practice; *pada*-*kamala* *tomāra* — Your lotus feet; *dhyāna* *kari’* — by meditation; *pāibe* *santoṣa* — we get satisfaction; *tomāra* — Your; *vākya* — words; *paripāṭī* — very kindly composed; *tāra* *madhye* — within that; *kuṭināṭī* — duplicity; *śuni’* — hearing; *gopīra* — of the *gopīs*; *āro* — more and more; *bāḍhe* — increases; *roṣa* — anger.

### Translation

**“The gopīs are not like the mystic yogīs. They will never be satisfied simply by meditating on Your lotus feet and imitating the so-called yogīs. Teaching the gopīs about meditation is another kind of duplicity. When they are instructed to undergo mystic yoga practice, they are not at all satisfied. On the contrary, they become more and more angry with You.”**

### Purport

Śrīla Prabodhānanda Sarasvatī has stated (*Caitanya-candrāmṛta* 5):

*kaivalyaṁ narakāyate tridaśa-pūr ākāśa-puṣpāyate *
 *durdāntendriya-kāla-sarpa-paṭalī protkhāta-daṁṣṭrāyate  
viśvaṁ pūrṇa-sukhāyate vidhi-mahendrādiś ca kīṭāyate *
 *yat kāruṇya-katākṣa-vaibhava-vatāṁ taṁ gauram eva stumaḥ*

For a pure devotee who has realized Kṛṣṇa consciousness through Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, the monistic philosophy by which one becomes one with the Supreme appears hellish. The mystic *yoga* practice, by which the mind is controlled and the senses are subjugated, also appears ludicrous to a pure devotee. The devotee’s mind and senses are already engaged in the transcendental service of the Lord. In this way the poisonous effects of sensory activities are removed. If one’s mind is always engaged in the service of the Lord, there is no possibility that one will think, feel or act materially. Similarly, the fruitive workers’ attempt to attain to the heavenly planets is nothing more than a phantasmagoria for the devotee. After all, the heavenly planets are material, and in due course of time they will all be dissolved. Devotees do not care for such temporary things. They engage in transcendental devotional activities because they desire elevation to the spiritual world, where they can live eternally and peacefully and with full knowledge of Kṛṣṇa. In Vṛndāvana, the *gopīs,* cowherd boys and even the calves, cows, trees and water are fully conscious of Kṛṣṇa. They are never satisfied with anything but Kṛṣṇa.

### Synonyms

*deha*-*smṛti* — bodily concept of life; *nāhi* — not; *yāra* — one whose; *saṁsāra*-*kūpa* — blind well of material life; *kāhāṅ* — where is; *tāra* — his; *tāhā* *haite* — from that; *nā* — does not; *cāhe* — want; *uddhāra* — liberation; *viraha*-*samudra*-*jale* — in the water of the ocean of separation; *kāma*-*timiṅgile* — the transcendental Cupid in the form of *timiṅgila* fish; *gile* — swallow; *gopī*-*gaṇe* — the *gopīs*; *neha’* — please take out; *tāra* *pāra* — beyond that.

### Translation

**Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu continued, “The gopīs have fallen into the great ocean of separation and are being devoured by the timiṅgila fish of their ambition to serve You. The gopīs are to be delivered from the mouths of these timiṅgila fish, for they are pure devotees. Since they have no material conception of life, why should they aspire for liberation? The gopīs do not want that liberation desired by yogīs and jñānīs, for they are already liberated from the ocean of material existence.**

### Purport

The bodily conception is created by the desire for material enjoyment. This is called *vipada-smṛti,* which is the opposite of real life. The living entity is eternally the servant of Kṛṣṇa, but when he desires to enjoy the material world, he cannot progress in spiritual life. One can never be happy by advancing materially. This is also stated in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (7.5.30): *adānta-gobhir viśatāṁ tamisraṁ punaḥ punaś carvita-carvaṇānām.* Through the uncontrolled senses, one may advance one’s hellish condition. He may continue to chew the chewed; that is, repeatedly accept birth and death. The conditioned souls use the duration of life between birth and death only to engage in the same hackneyed activities — eating, sleeping, mating and defending. In the lower animal species, we find the same activities. Since these activities are repeated, engaging in them is like chewing that which has already been chewed. If one can give up his ambition to engage in hackneyed material life and take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness instead, he will be liberated from the stringent laws of material nature. One does not need to make a separate attempt to become liberated. If one simply engages in the service of the Lord, he will be liberated automatically. As Śrīla Bilvamaṅgala Ṭhākura therefore says, *muktiḥ svayaṁ mukulitāñjali sevate ’smān:* “Liberation stands before me with folded hands, begging to serve me.”

### Purport

Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī did not express Her personal unhappiness at being separated from Kṛṣṇa. She wanted to evoke Kṛṣṇa’s feelings for the condition of all the others in Vṛndāvana-dhāma — mother Yaśodā, Mahārāja Nanda, the cowherd boys, the *gopīs,* the birds and bees on the banks of the Yamunā, the water of the Yamunā, the trees, the forests and all the other paraphernalia associated with Kṛṣṇa before He left Vṛndāvana for Mathurā. These feelings of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī were manifested by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and therefore He invited Lord Jagannātha, Kṛṣṇa, to return to Vṛndāvana. That is the purport of the Ratha-yātrā car’s going from Jagannātha Purī to the Guṇḍicā temple.

### Purport

It is said: *vṛndāvanaṁ parityajya padam ekaṁ na gacchati.* In one sense, Kṛṣṇa, the original Personality of Godhead (*īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ*), does not even take one step away from Vṛndāvana. However, in order to take care of various duties, Kṛṣṇa had to leave Vṛndāvana. He had to go to Mathurā to kill Kaṁsa, and then He was taken by His father to Dvārakā, where He was busy with state affairs and disturbances created by demons. Kṛṣṇa was away from Vṛndāvana, and He was not at all happy, as He plainly disclosed to Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī. She is the dearmost life and soul of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, and He expressed His mind to Her as follows.

**Śrī Kṛṣṇa continued: “All the inhabitants of Vṛndāvana-dhāma — My mother, father, cowherd boyfriends and everything else — are like My life and soul. And among all the inhabitants of Vṛndāvana, the gopīs are My very life and soul. And among the gopīs, You, Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī, are the chief. Therefore You are the very life of My life.**

### Purport

Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī is the center of all Vṛndāvana’s activities. In Vṛndāvana, Kṛṣṇa is the instrument of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī; therefore all the inhabitants of Vṛndāvana still chant “Jaya Rādhe!” From Kṛṣṇa’s own statement given herein, it appears that Rādhārāṇī is the Queen of Vṛndāvana and that Kṛṣṇa is simply Her decoration. Kṛṣṇa is known as Madana-mohana, the enchanter of Cupid, but Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī is the enchanter of Kṛṣṇa. Consequently Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī is called Madana-mohana-mohinī, the enchanter of the enchanter of Cupid.

### Purport

Kṛṣṇa has two kinds of presence — *prakaṭa* and *aprakaṭa,* manifest and unmanifest. These are identical for the sincere devotee. Even if Kṛṣṇa is not physically present, the devotee’s constant absorption in the affairs of Kṛṣṇa makes Him always present. This is confirmed in the *Brahma-saṁhitā* (5.38):

*premāñjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena *
 *santaḥ sadaiva hṛdayeṣu vilokayanti  
yaṁ śyāmasundaram acintya-guṇa-svarūpaṁ *
 *govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi*

Due to his intense love, the pure devotee always sees Lord Kṛṣṇa present within his heart. All glories to Govinda, the primeval Personality of Godhead! When Kṛṣṇa is not manifest before the inhabitants of Vṛndāvana, they are always absorbed in thoughts of Him. Therefore even though at that time Kṛṣṇa was living in Dvārakā, He was simultaneously present before all the inhabitants of Vṛndāvana. This was His *aprakaṭa* presence. Devotees who are always absorbed in thoughts of Kṛṣṇa will soon see Kṛṣṇa face to face without a doubt. In other words, devotees who are always engaged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness and are fully absorbed in thoughts of Kṛṣṇa certainly return home, back to Godhead. They then see Kṛṣṇa directly, face to face, talk with Him and enjoy His company. This is confirmed in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (4.9): *tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti so ’rjuna*.

Because during his lifetime a pure devotee is always speaking of Kṛṣṇa and engaging in His service, as soon as he gives up his body he immediately returns to Goloka Vṛndāvana, where Kṛṣṇa is personally present. He then meets Kṛṣṇa directly. This is successful human life. This is the meaning of *prakaṭeha ānibe satvara:* The pure devotee will soon see the personal manifestation of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa.

### Purport

Just as Kṛṣṇa does not take a step away from Vṛndāvana, Kṛṣṇa’s devotee also does not like to leave Vṛndāvana. However, when he has to tend to Kṛṣṇa’s business, he leaves Vṛndāvana. After finishing his mission, a pure devotee returns home, back to Vṛndāvana, back to Godhead. Kṛṣṇa assured Rādhārāṇī that after killing the demons outside Vṛndāvana, He would return. “I am coming back very soon,” He promised, “as soon as I have killed the few remaining demons.”

### Synonyms

### Translation

**However, just to warn His personal associates, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, externally expressed feelings of anger.**

### Purport

When Mahārāja Pratāparudra asked to see the Lord, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu immediately refused, saying:

*niṣkiñcanasya bhagavad-bhajanonmukhasya *
 *pāraṁ paraṁ jigamiṣor bhava-sāgarasya  
sandarśanaṁ viṣayiṇām atha yoṣitāṁ ca *
 *hā hanta hanta viṣa-bhakṣaṇato ’py asādhu*

(*Caitanya-candrodaya-nāṭaka* 8.23)

The word *niṣkiñcanasya* refers to a person who has finished his material activities. Such a person can begin to execute his activities in Kṛṣṇa consciousness to cross over the ocean of nescience. It is very dangerous for such a person to have intimate relationships with mundane people or to become intimately related with women. This formality is to be observed by anyone who is serious about going back home, back to Godhead. To teach His personal associates these principles, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu expressed external anger when touched by the King. Since the Lord was very much satisfied with the humble behavior of the King, He intentionally allowed the King to touch Him, but externally He expressed anger just to warn His personal associates.

### Purport

Although outwardly the King was a mundane man interested in money and women, internally he was purified by devotional activities. He showed this by engaging as a street sweeper to please Lord Jagannātha. A person may appear to be a pounds-and-shillings man interested in money and women, but if he is actually very meek and humble and surrendered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he is not mundane. Such a judgment can be made only by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and His very confidential devotees. As a general principle, however, no devotee should intimately mix with mundane people interested in money and women.
