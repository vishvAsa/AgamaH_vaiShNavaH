CHAPTER EIGHT

The summary of the eighth chapter is given by Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura in his *Amṛta-pravāha-bhāṣya.* After visiting the temple of Jiyaḍa-nṛsiṁha, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu went to the banks of the river Godāvarī, to a place known as Vidyānagara. When Śrīla Rāmānanda Rāya went there to take his bath, they met. After introducing himself, Śrī Rāmānanda Rāya requested Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu to remain in the village for some days. Honoring his request, Caitanya Mahāprabhu stayed there in the home of some Vedic *brāhmaṇas.* In the evening, Śrīla Rāmānanda Rāya used to come to see Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Rāmānanda Rāya, who was clothed in ordinary dress, offered the Lord respectful obeisances. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu questioned him on the object and process of worship and also asked him to recite verses from the Vedic literature.

First of all, Śrīla Rāmānanda Rāya enunciated the system of the *varṇāśrama* institution. He recited various verses about *karmārpaṇa,* stating that everything should be dedicated to the Lord. He then spoke of detached action, knowledge mixed with devotional service, and finally the spontaneous loving service of the Lord. After hearing Śrīla Rāmānanda Rāya recite some verses, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu accepted the principle of pure devotional service devoid of all kinds of speculation. After this, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu asked Rāmānanda Rāya to explain the higher platform of devotional service. Then Śrīla Rāmānanda Rāya explained unalloyed devotional service, love of Godhead, and serving the Lord in the moods of pure servitude, fraternity and parental love. Finally he spoke of serving the Lord in conjugal love. He then spoke of how conjugal love can be developed in various ways. This conjugal love attains its highest perfection in Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī’s love for Kṛṣṇa. He next described the position of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī and the transcendental mellows of love of God. Śrīla Rāmānanda Rāya then recited a verse of his own concerning the platform of ecstatic vision, technically called *prema-vilāsa-vivarta.* Śrīla Rāmānanda Rāya also explained that all stages of conjugal love can be attained through the mercy of the residents of Vṛndāvana, especially by the mercy of the *gopīs.* All these subject matters were thus vividly described. Gradually Rāmānanda Rāya could understand the position of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and when Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu exhibited His real form, Rāmānanda Rāya fell unconscious. After some days, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu asked Rāmānanda Rāya to retire from government service and come to Jagannātha Purī. These descriptions of the meetings between Rāmānanda Rāya and Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu are taken from the notebook of Svarūpa Dāmodara Gosvāmī.

### Synonyms

*ei*-*mata* — in this way; *vipra*-*gaṇa* — all the *brāhmaṇas*; *bhāve* — think; *mane* *mana* — within their minds; *vijātīya* *loka* — outside people; *dekhi* — seeing; *prabhu* — Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu; *kaila* — did; *samvaraṇa* — restraining.

### Translation

**While the brāhmaṇas were thinking in this way about the activities of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and Rāmānanda Rāya, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu saw those outsiders and restrained His transcendental emotions.**

### Purport

Rāmānanda Rāya was intimately related to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu; therefore he can be accepted as a *sajātīya,* a person within the intimate circle of the Lord. The *brāhmaṇas,* however, were followers of the Vedic rituals and were not able to have an intimate connection with Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Consequently they are called *vijātīya-loka.* In other words, they were not pure devotees. One may be a highly learned *brāhmaṇa,* but if he is not a pure devotee he is a *vijātīya,* an outcaste, one outside devotional service — in other words, a nondevotee. Although Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and Rāmānanda Rāya were embracing in ecstasy, the Lord restrained His transcendental emotions upon seeing the outsider *brāhmaṇas.*

### Translation

**“You do not fear the Vedic injunctions stating that You should not associate with a śūdra. You were not contemptuous of my touch, although in the Vedas You are forbidden to associate with śūdras.**

### Purport

In the *Bhagavad-gītā* (9.32) the Lord says:

*māṁ hi pārtha vyapāśritya* *ye ’pi syuḥ pāpa-yonayaḥ  
striyo vaiśyās tathā śūdrās* *te ’pi yānti parāṁ gatim*

“O son of Pṛthā, those who take shelter in Me, though they be of lower birth — women, *vaiśyas* \[merchants\], as well as *śūdras* \[workers\] — can attain the supreme destination.”

The word *pāpa-yonayaḥ* means “born into a lower-class.” According to the Vedic system of classification, women, *vaiśyas,* and *śūdras* belong to a lower social order. A low life means a life without Kṛṣṇa consciousness. High and low positions in society are calculated by considering a person’s Kṛṣṇa consciousness. A *brāhmaṇa* is considered to be on the highest platform because he knows Brahman, the Absolute Truth. The second caste, the *kṣatriya* caste, also know Brahman, but not as well as the *brāhmaṇas.* The *vaiśyas* and *śūdras* do not clearly understand God consciousness, but if they take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness by the mercy of Kṛṣṇa and the spiritual master, they do not remain in the lower castes (*pāpa-yonayaḥ*). It is clearly stated: *te ’pi yānti parāṁ gatim.*

Unless one has attained the highest standard of life, one cannot return home, back to Godhead. One may be a *śūdra, vaiśya* or woman, but if one is situated in the service of the Lord in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, one should not be considered *strī, śūdra, vaiśya* or lower than *śūdra.* Though a person may be from a lowborn family, if he is engaged in the Lord’s service he should never be considered to belong to a lowborn family. The *Padma Purāṇa* forbids, *vīkṣate jāti-sāmānyāt sa yāti narakaṁ-dhruvam.* A person goes to hell quickly when he considers a devotee of the Lord in terms of birth. Although Śrī Rāmānanda Rāya supposedly took birth in a *śūdra* family, he is not to be considered a *śūdra,* for he was a great advanced devotee. Indeed, he was on the transcendental platform. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu therefore embraced him. Out of spiritual humility, Śrī Rāmānanda Rāya presented himself as a *śūdra* (*rāja-sevī viṣayī śūdrādhama*). Even though one may engage in government service or in any other pounds-shillings-pence business — in short, in materialistic life — he need only take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Kṛṣṇa consciousness is a very simple process. One need only chant the holy names of the Lord and strictly follow the principles forbidding sinful activity. In this way one can no longer be considered an untouchable, a *viṣayī* or a *śūdra.* One who is advanced in spiritual life should not associate with nondevotees — namely men in government service and men engaged in materialistic activity for sense gratification or in the service of others. Such men are considered *viṣayī,* materialistic. It is said:

*niṣkiñcanasya bhagavad-bhajanonmukhasya *
 *pāraṁ paraṁ jigamiṣor bhava-sāgarasya  
sandarśanaṁ viṣayiṇām atha yoṣitāṁ ca *
 *hā hanta hanta viṣa-bhakṣaṇato ’py asādhu*

“A person who is very seriously engaged in cultivating devotional service with a view to crossing the ocean of nescience and who has completely abandoned all material activities should never see a *śūdra,* a *vaiśya* or a woman.” (*Śrī Caitanya-candrodaya-nāṭaka* 8.23)

### Translation

**“You have come here specifically to deliver me. You are so merciful that You alone can deliver all fallen souls.**

### Purport

Śrīla Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura sings in his *Prārthanā* (39):

*śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya-prabhu dayā kara more,  
tomā vinā ke dayālu jagat-saṁsāre*

*patita-pāvana-hetu tava avatāra,  
mo sama patita prabhu nā pāibe āra*

“My dear Lord, please be merciful to me. Who can be more merciful than Your Lordship within these three worlds? You appear as an incarnation just to reclaim the conditioned, fallen souls, but I assure You that You will not find a soul more fallen than me.”

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s specific mission is to deliver fallen souls. Of course, in this Age of Kali there is hardly anyone who is not fallen according to the calculations of Vedic behavior. In His instructions to Rūpa Gosvāmī, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu described the so-called followers of Vedic religion in this way (*Madhya* 19.146):

*veda-niṣṭha-madhye ardheka veda ‘mukhe’ māne  
veda-niṣiddha pāpa kare, dharma nāhi gaṇe*

So-called followers of Vedic principles simply accept the *Vedas* formally, but they act against Vedic principles. This is symptomatic of this Age of Kali. People claim to follow a certain type of religion, saying formally, “I am Hindu,” “I am Muslim,” “I am Christian,” “I am this or that,” but actually no one follows the principles enunciated in religious scriptures. This is the disease of this age. Therefore the merciful Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu has simply advised us to chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra: harer nāma harer nāma harer nāmaiva kevalam.* The Lord can deliver anyone and everyone, even though one may have fallen from the injunctions of revealed scriptures. This is Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s special mercy. Consequently He is known as *patita-pāvana,* the deliverer of all fallen souls.

*mahānta-svabhāva ei tārite pāmara  
nija kārya nāhi tabu yāna tāra ghara*

### Synonyms

*mahānta*-*svabhāva* — the nature of saintly persons; *ei* — this; *tārite* — to deliver; *pāmara* — fallen souls; *nija* — own; *kārya* — business; *nāhi* — there is not; *tabu* — still; *yāna* — goes; *tāra* — his; *ghara* — house.

### Translation

**“It is the general practice of all saintly people to deliver the fallen. Therefore they go to people’s houses, although they have no personal business there.**

### Purport

A *sannyāsī* is supposed to beg from door to door. He does not beg simply because he is hungry. His real purpose is to enlighten the occupant of every house by preaching Kṛṣṇa consciousness. A *sannyāsī* does not abandon his superior position and become a beggar just for the sake of begging. Similarly, a person in householder life may be very important, but he may also voluntarily take to the mendicant way of life. Rūpa Gosvāmī and Sanātana Gosvāmī were ministers, but they voluntarily accepted the mendicant’s life in order to humbly preach Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s message. It is said about them: *tyaktvā tūrṇam aśeṣa-maṇḍala-pati-śreṇīṁ sadā tuccha-vat bhūtvā dīna-gaṇeśakau karuṇayā kaupīna-kanthāśritau.* Although the Gosvāmīs were very aristocratic, on the order of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu they became mendicants just to deliver the fallen souls. One should also consider that those who engage in the missionary activities of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement are under the guidance of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. They are not actually beggars; their real business is to deliver fallen souls. Therefore they may go from door to door just to introduce a book about Kṛṣṇa consciousness so that people can become enlightened by reading. Formerly *brahmacārīs* and *sannyāsīs* used to beg from door to door. At the present moment, especially in the Western countries, a person may be handed over to the police if he begs from door to door. In Western countries, begging is considered criminal. Members of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement have no business begging. Instead, they work very hard to introduce some literatures about Kṛṣṇa consciousness so that people can read them and be benefited. But if one gives some contribution to a Kṛṣṇa conscious man, he never refuses it.

### Translation

**“My dear Sir, according to Your behavior and bodily features, You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is impossible for ordinary living beings to possess such transcendental qualities.”**

### Purport

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s bodily features were uncommon. Indeed, His body was extraordinary in its measurements. The measurement of His chest and the measurement of His forearms were the same. This is called *nyagrodha-parimaṇḍala.* As far as His nature is concerned, He was kind to everyone. No one but the Supreme Personality of Godhead can be kind to everyone. Therefore the Lord’s name is Kṛṣṇa, “all-attractive.” As stated in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (14.4), Kṛṣṇa is the kind father of everyone. In every species of life (*sarva-yoniṣu*), He is the original father, the seed-giver (*bīja-pradaḥ pitā*). How, then, can He be unkind to any living entity? One may be a man, an animal or even a tree, but the Lord is kind to everyone. That is God’s qualification. He also says in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (9.29), *samo ’haṁ sarva-bhūteṣu:* “I am equally kind to everyone.” And He advises, *sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja:* “Give up all other engagements and simply surrender unto Me.” This instruction is meant not only for Arjuna but for all living entities. Whoever takes advantage of this offer is immediately immune to all sinful activity and returns home, back to Godhead. While present on this planet, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu made the same offer.

### Translation

**The Lord replied to Rāmānanda Rāya, “Sir, you are the best of the topmost devotees; therefore simply the sight of you has melted everyone’s heart.**

### Purport

Unless one is a first-class devotee, he cannot be a preacher. A preacher is generally a topmost devotee, but in order to meet the general populace, he has to come to distinguish between devotees and nondevotees. Otherwise, an advanced devotee makes no such distinctions. Indeed, he always sees that everyone is engaged in the service of the Lord. When one engages in preaching work, he must distinguish between people and understand that some people are not engaged in the devotional service of the Lord. The preacher then has to take compassion upon such innocent people who do not know how to worship the Lord. In *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (11.2.45), the symptoms of a topmost devotee are described as follows:

*sarva-bhūteṣu yaḥ paśyed* *bhagavad-bhāvam ātmanaḥ  
bhūtāni bhagavaty ātmany* *eṣa bhāgavatottamaḥ*

“The advanced devotee sees that all living entities are part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Everyone is in Kṛṣṇa, and Kṛṣṇa is also within everyone. Such a vision is possible only for a person who is very advanced in devotional service.”

### Translation

**Rāmānanda Rāya approached Lord Śrī Caitanya and offered his respectful obeisances, and the Lord embraced him. Then they began to discuss Kṛṣṇa in a secluded place.**

### Purport

The word *rahaḥ-sthāne,* “in a secluded place,” is very significant. Talks about Kṛṣṇa and His pastimes — especially His pastimes in Vṛndāvana and His dealings with the *gopīs* — are all very confidential. They are not subject matter for public discussion because those who have no understanding of the transcendental nature of Kṛṣṇa’s pastimes always commit great offenses, thinking Kṛṣṇa to be an ordinary human being and the *gopīs* ordinary girls. Following the principle of Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, who never discussed the dealings between Kṛṣṇa and the *gopīs* publicly, devotees in the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement are enjoined not to discuss the pastimes of Lord Kṛṣṇa in Vṛndāvana in public. For the general public, *saṅkīrtana* is the most effective method to awaken Kṛṣṇa consciousness. If possible, one should discuss the principles enunciated in the *Bhagavad-gītā.* Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu followed this principle very strictly and discussed the philosophy of the *Bhagavad-gītā* with learned scholars like Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya and Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī. However, He taught the principles of the *bhakti* cult to students like Sanātana Gosvāmī and Rūpa Gosvāmī, and He discussed with Śrī Rāmānanda Rāya the topmost devotional dealings between Kṛṣṇa and the *gopīs.* For the general populace, He performed *saṅkīrtana* very vigorously. We must also follow these principles in preaching Kṛṣṇa consciousness all over the world.

### Translation

**Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu ordered Rāmānanda Rāya, “Recite a verse from the revealed scriptures concerning the ultimate goal of life.”**

### Purport

**Rāmānanda replied, “If one executes the prescribed duties of his social position, he awakens his original Kṛṣṇa consciousness.**

In this connection, Śrī Rāmānujācārya states in the *Vedārtha-saṅgraha* that devotional service is naturally very dear to the living entity. Indeed, it is life’s goal. This devotional service is supreme knowledge, or Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and it brings detachment from all material activity. In the transcendental position, a living being can perfectly acknowledge the superiority of serving the Supreme Lord. The devotees attain the Supreme Lord only by devotional service. Having such knowledge, one engages in his occupational duty, and that is called *bhakti-yoga.* By performing *bhakti-yoga,* one can rise to the platform of pure devotional service.

A great saint, the father of Śrīla Vyāsadeva, Parāśara Muni, has specifically mentioned that devotional service to the Lord can ultimately be awakened in human society by the discharge of duties in accordance with the *varṇāśrama* system*.* The Supreme Personality of Godhead instituted *varṇāśrama-dharma* to give human beings a chance to return home, back to Godhead. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, who is known in the *Bhagavad-gītā* as Puruṣottama — the greatest of all personalities — personally came and declared that the institution of *varṇāśrama-dharma* was founded by Him. As stated in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (4.13):

*cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭaṁ* *guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ  
tasya kartāram api māṁ* *viddhy akartāram avyayam*

Elsewhere in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (18.45-46) the Lord says:

*sve sve karmaṇy abhirataḥ* *saṁsiddhiṁ labhate naraḥ  
sva-karma-nirataḥ siddhiṁ* *yathā vindati tac chṛṇu*

*yataḥ pravṛttir bhūtānāṁ* *yena sarvam idaṁ tatam  
sva-karmaṇā tam abhyarcya* *siddhiṁ vindati mānavaḥ*

Human society should be divided into four divisions — *brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya* and *śūdra* — and everyone should always engage in his occupational duty. The Lord says that those engaged in their occupational duty can attain perfection simply by rendering loving devotional service to the Lord while executing their particular duty. Actually the modern ideal of a classless society can be introduced only by Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Let men perform their occupational duty, and let them give their profits to the service of the Lord. In other words, one can attain the perfection of life by discharging one’s occupational duty and employing the results in the service of the Lord. This method is confirmed by great personalities like Bodhāyana, Taṅka, Dramiḍa, Guhadeva, Kapardi and Bhāruci. It is also confirmed by the *Vedānta-sūtra.*

### Translation

**“ ‘The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Viṣṇu, is worshiped by the proper execution of prescribed duties in the system of varṇa and āśrama. There is no other way to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One must be situated in the institution of the four varṇas and āśramas.’ ”**

### Purport

This is a quotation from the *Viṣṇu Purāṇa* (3.8.9). As stated by Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura in his *Amṛta-pravāha-bhāṣya,* “The purport is that one can realize life’s perfection simply by satisfying the Supreme Personality of Godhead.” This is also confirmed in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (1.2.13):

*ataḥ pumbhir dvija-śreṣṭhā* *varṇāśrama-vibhāgaśaḥ  
sv-anuṣṭhitasya dharmasya* *saṁsiddhir hari-toṣaṇam*

“O best among the twice-born, it is therefore concluded that the highest perfection one can achieve by discharging the duties prescribed for one’s own occupation according to caste divisions and orders of life is to please the Personality of Godhead.”

Every man should perform his occupational duty in the light of his particular tendency. According to his abilities, one should accept a position in the *varṇāśrama* institution. The divisions of *brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya* and *śūdra* are natural divisions within society. Indeed, everyone has a prescribed duty according to the *varṇāśrama-dharma.* Those who properly execute their prescribed duties live peacefully and are not disturbed by material conditions. The spiritual orders — *brahmacarya, gṛhastha, vānaprastha* and *sannyāsa* — are called *āśramas.* If one executes his prescribed duty in both the social and spiritual orders, the Supreme Personality of Godhead is satisfied. If one neglects his duties, however, he becomes a transgressor and a candidate for a hellish condition. Actually we see that different people are engaged in different ways; therefore there must be divisions according to work. To attain perfection, one must make devotional service the center of life. In this way one can awaken his natural instincts by work, association and education. One should accept the *varṇāśrama* divisions by qualification, not by birth. Unless this system is introduced, human activities cannot be systematically executed.

The *brāhmaṇas* are the intellectuals who can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. They are always engaged in the cultivation of knowledge. It does not matter whether one is born in India or outside India. Those who are naturally very heroic and who tend to rule over others are called *kṣatriyas.* Those who tend to produce food by agricultural methods, protect cows and other animals and engage in trade are called *vaiśyas,* or merchants. Those who are not sufficiently intelligent to be *brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas* or *vaiśyas* are required to serve a master and are called *śūdras.* Thus everyone can engage in the service of the Lord and awaken his natural Kṛṣṇa consciousness. If a society does not function according to such natural divisions, the social orders become degraded. The conclusion is that the scientific method of *varṇāśrama-dharma* should be adopted by society.

### Purport

The Lord has said that the *varṇāśrama-dharma* is not properly executed in this Age of Kali; therefore He ordered Rāmānanda Rāya to go further into the matter. Rāmānanda replied with this verse from the *Bhagavad-gītā* (9.27), which instructs that while remaining in the system of *varṇāśrama-dharma* one may offer the results of his activities to Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa in loving service. Naturally Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was asking Rāmānanda Rāya about the execution of devotional service. Rāmānanda Rāya first enunciated the principle of *varṇāśrama-dharma* in consideration of materialistic people. However, this conception is not transcendental. As long as one is in the material world, he must follow the principles of *varṇāśrama-dharma,* but devotional service is transcendental. The system of *varṇāśrama-dharma* refers to the three modes of material nature, but transcendental devotional service is on the absolute platform.

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu belongs to the spiritual world, and His methods for propagating the *saṅkīrtana* movement are also imported from the spiritual world. Śrīla Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura has sung: *golokera prema-dhana, hari-nāma-saṅkīrtana, rati na janmila kene tāya.* This states that the *saṅkīrtana* movement has nothing to do with this material world. It is imported from the spiritual world, Goloka Vṛndāvana. Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura laments that mundane people do not take this *saṅkīrtana* movement seriously. Considering the position of devotional service and the *saṅkīrtana* movement, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu deemed the system of *varṇāśrama-dharma* to be material, although it aims at elevation to the spiritual platform. However, the *saṅkīrtana* movement can raise one immediately to the spiritual platform. Consequently it is said that *varṇāśrama-dharma* is external, and Caitanya Mahāprabhu requested Rāmānanda Rāya to proceed deeper into the matter and uncover the spiritual platform.

Sometimes materialists consider Lord Viṣṇu a material conception. Impersonalists think that above Lord Viṣṇu is the impersonal Brahman. The impersonalists misunderstand the worship of Lord Viṣṇu. They worship Lord Viṣṇu to merge into His body. In order that *viṣṇu-ārādhana* not be misunderstood, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu requested that Śrī Rāmānanda Rāya proceed further and clear up the issue. Rāmānanda Rāya quoted the verse from the *Bhagavad-gītā* stating that the results of one’s occupational duty may be offered to Lord Viṣṇu or Kṛṣṇa. In *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (1.2.8) it is also said:

*dharmaḥ sv-anuṣṭhitaḥ puṁsāṁ* *viṣvaksena-kathāsu yaḥ  
notpādayed yadi ratiṁ* *śrama eva hi kevalam*

“If one executes the occupational duties of *varṇāśrama-dharma* but does not cultivate his dormant Kṛṣṇa consciousness, his activities are futile. His occupation simply becomes unnecessary labor.”

### Translation

**“This is also external,” Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu said. “Please proceed and speak further on this matter.”**

**Rāmānanda Rāya replied, “To give up one’s occupational duties in the varṇāśrama system is the essence of perfection.”**

### Purport

A *brāhmaṇa* may renounce his family and accept *sannyāsa.* Others — *kṣatriyas* and *vaiśyas* — may also give up their families and take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Such renunciation is called *karma-tyāga.* By such renunciation, the Supreme Personality of Godhead is satisfied.

In contrast, the process of renouncing the results of one’s activities by offering these results to Kṛṣṇa is not considered uncontaminated, because, although such a process implies that one recognizes Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Person, it still involves one in activities on the material platform. Since such activities are within the material universe, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu considered them external. To correct this, Rāmānanda Rāya recommended that one take to the renounced order of life in order to transcend material activities. This is supported by the following verse from *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (11.11.32).

### Translation

**“As stated in scripture \[Bg. 18.66\], ‘After giving up all kinds of religious and occupational duties, if you come to Me, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and take shelter, I will give you protection from all of life’s sinful reactions. Do not worry.’ ”**

### Purport

In this connection, Śrīla Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī instructs in his book *Manaḥ-śikṣā* (2):

*na dharmaṁ nādharmaṁ śruti-gaṇa-niruktaṁ kila kuru *
 *vraje rādhā-kṛṣṇa-pracura-paricaryām iha tanu*

He has thus enjoined that we should not perform religious or irreligious activities as prescribed in the *Vedas.* The best course is to engage always in the service of Lord Kṛṣṇa and Rādhārāṇī. That is the perfection of everything in this life. Similarly, in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (4.29.46) it is said by Nārada Muni:

*yadā yasyānugṛhṇāti* *bhagavān ātma-bhāvitaḥ  
sa jahāti matiṁ loke* *vede ca pariniṣṭhitām*

“When one actually takes to the loving service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he gives up all duties in the material world, as well as all duties prescribed by the Vedic literatures. In this way one is fixed in the service of the Lord.”

### Translation

**After hearing Rāmānanda Rāya speak in this way, Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu again rejected his statement and said, “Go ahead and say something more.”**

### Purport

**Rāmānanda Rāya then replied, “Devotional service mixed with empiric knowledge is the essence of perfection.”**

Devotional service mixed with non-Vedic speculative knowledge is certainly not pure devotional service. Therefore Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī in his *Anubhāṣya* preaches that self-realization following the execution of ritualistic ceremonies is in the neutral stage between liberation and conditioned life. It is a place beyond this material world, in the river Virajā, where the three modes of material nature are subdued or neutralized in the unmanifest stage. However, the spiritual world is a manifestation of spiritual energy and is known as Vaikuṇṭhaloka, “the place where there is no anxiety.” The material world, known as *brahmāṇḍa,* is the creation of the external energy. Between the two creations — the material creation and the spiritual creation — is a river known as Virajā, as well as a place known as Brahmaloka. Virajā-nadī and Brahmaloka are shelters for living entities disgusted with material life and inclined to impersonal existence by way of denying material variegatedness. Since these places are not situated in the Vaikunṭḥalokas, or the spiritual world, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu proclaims them to be external. In the Brahmaloka and Virajā-nadī, one cannot conceive of the Vaikuṇṭhalokas. Brahmaloka and Virajā-nadī are also attained after difficult austerities, but in these realms there is no understanding of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His transcendental loving service. Without such spiritual knowledge, simple detachment from material conditions is but another side of material existence. From the spiritual point of view, it is all external. When Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu rejected this proposal, Rāmānanda Rāya suggested that devotional service based on philosophy and logic is a more advanced position. He therefore quoted the following verse from the *Bhagavad-gītā* (18.54).

*brahma*-*bhūtaḥ* — freed from material conceptions of life but attached to an impersonal situation; *prasanna*-*ātmā* — fully joyful; *na* *śocati* — he does not lament; *na* *kāṅkṣati* — he does not hanker; *samaḥ* — equally disposed; *sarveṣu* — all; *bhūteṣu* — to the living entities; *mat*-*bhaktim* — My devotional service; *labhate* — achieves; *parām* — transcendental.

### Translation

**Rāmānanda Rāya continued, “According to the Bhagavad-gītā, ‘One who is thus transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman and becomes fully joyful. He never laments or desires to have anything. He is equally disposed toward every living entity. In that state he attains pure devotional service unto Me.’ ”**

### Purport

In this verse from the *Bhagavad-gītā* it is said that a person who accepts the theory of monism — being always engaged in empiric philosophical discussions about spiritual life — becomes joyful and is relieved from all material lamentation and hankering. At that stage, one is equipoised. He sees all living entities as spiritual beings. After attaining this elevated stage, one can attain pure devotional service. The conclusion is that devotional service mixed with ritualistic fruitive activity is inferior to spiritual service based on empiric philosophic discussion.

### Translation

**After hearing this, the Lord, as usual, rejected it, considering it to be external devotional service. He again asked Rāmānanda Rāya to speak further, and Rāmānanda Rāya replied, “Pure devotional service without any touch of speculative knowledge is the essence of perfection.”**

### Purport

In his *Anubhāṣya* commentary, Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura says that this stage — devotional service mixed with speculative knowledge — is also external and not within the jurisdiction of pure devotional service as practiced in Vaikuṇṭhaloka. As soon as there is some conception of materialistic thought — be it positive or negative — the service is not spiritual. It may be free from material contamination, but because there is mental speculation the devotional service is not pure and freed from the contamination of material life. A living entity who wants to be completely pure must be above this material conception. The negation of material existence does not necessarily mean spiritual existence. After material existence is negated, spiritual existence — namely *sac-cid-ānanda* — still may not be manifested. Until one comes to the stage of actually understanding one’s eternal relationship with the Supreme Lord, he cannot enter into spiritual life. Spiritual life means becoming detached from material life and engaging in the loving service of the Lord. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu therefore asked Rāmānanda Rāya to explain something transcendental to devotional service mixed with speculative knowledge. A pure devotee is completely surrendered to the lotus feet of the Lord, and only by his love does he conquer Kṛṣṇa, who cannot be conquered by anyone. Kṛṣṇa always stands victorious over everything. No one can conquer Him. One can attain the stage of pure devotion simply by fully surrendering. This is next corroborated by *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (10.14.3), wherein Lord Brahmā, defeated by the potency of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, fully surrendered unto the Lord.

They should completely follow the principles of devotional service and remain free from illicit sex, gambling, intoxication and animal slaughter. Surrendering themselves fully with body, words and mind, they can live in any āśrama or social status. Indeed, You are conquered by such persons, although You are always unconquerable.’ ”**

### Translation

**At this point, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu replied, “This is all right, but still you can speak more on the subject.”**

### Purport

**Rāmānanda Rāya then replied, “Ecstatic love for the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the essence of all perfection.”**

In his *Amṛta-pravāha-bhāṣya,* Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura summarizes the conversation up to this point, where Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu says to Rāmānanda Rāya, *eho haya, āge kaha āra:* “This is the process accepted in devotional service, but there is something more than this. Therefore please explain what is beyond.” Simply executing the duties of all *varṇas* and *āśramas* is not as good as offering all the results of one’s activities to the Lord. When one gives up all fruitive activity and fully surrenders to the Lord, he attains *sva-dharma-tyāga,* wherein he abandons the social order and takes to the renounced order. That is certainly better. However, better than the renounced order is cultivation of knowledge mixed with devotional service. Yet all these activities are external to the activities of the spiritual world. There is no touch of pure devotional service in them. Pure devotional service cannot be attained by empiric philosophy, nor can perfection be attained simply by good association. Devotional service by self-realization is a different subject matter. It is untouched by fruitive activity, for one surrenders the results of activities to the Lord, abandons prescribed duties and accepts the renounced order of life. Such devotional service is situated on a higher platform than that of empiric philosophical speculation with a mixture of *bhakti.* This is verified by Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī in his *Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu* (1.1.11):

*anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyaṁ* *jñāna-karmādy-anāvṛtam  
ānukūlyena kṛṣṇānu-* *śīlanaṁ bhaktir uttamā*

“One should render transcendental loving service to the Supreme Lord Kṛṣṇa favorably and without desire for material profit or gain through fruitive activities or philosophical speculation. That is called pure devotional service.”

Devotional activities, however, sometimes appear to be impure in the neophyte stage, but in the mature stage they are completely pure, or free from material activity. Therefore Rāmānanda Rāya replied after hearing the last statement of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu: *prema-bhakti* — *sarva-sādhya-sāra.* Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu actually accepted this verse (*jñāne prayāsam*) as the basic principle of perfection. One has to practice this principle in order to make further progress. When further progress is actually made, one comes to the platform of ecstatic loving service to the Lord. This first stage is technically called *sādhana-bhakti,* or devotional service in practice. The result of *sādhana-bhakti* must be ecstatic love, attachment for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, which is also called *prema-bhakti.* In the neophyte stage, *sādhana-bhakti* includes faith, association with devotees, and practicing devotional service. Thus one is freed from all unwanted things. One then becomes fixed in devotional service and increases his desire to act in devotional service. Thus one becomes attached to the Lord and His devotional service.

### Translation

**“ ‘Pure devotional service in Kṛṣṇa consciousness cannot be had even by pious activity in hundreds and thousands of lives. It can be attained only by paying one price — that is, intense greed to obtain it. If it is available somewhere, one must purchase it without delay.’ ”**

### Purport

The previous two verses are included in the *Padyāvalī* (13, 14), an anthology compiled by Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī. Verse 69 refers to devotional service in faith, and verse 70 refers to devotional service rendered out of intense greed. The first is devotional service rendered in accordance with the regulative principles, and the second refers to spontaneous loving service of the Lord without extraneous endeavor. Henceforward the basic principle underlying the talks between Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and Rāmānanda Rāya will be spontaneous loving service to the Lord. The regulative principles according to the injunctions of the *śāstras* are necessary insofar as one’s original dormant Kṛṣṇa consciousness is not spontaneously awakened. An example of spontaneous action is the flowing of rivers into the ocean. Nothing can stop this flow of water. Similarly, when one’s dormant Kṛṣṇa consciousness is awakened, it spontaneously flows to the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa without impediment. Whatever will be spoken henceforth by Rāmānanda Rāya based on spontaneous love will be agreeable to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and the Lord will ask him more and more about this subject.

### Purport

**In reply, Rāmānanda Rāya said, “Spontaneous loving service in servitude — as exchanged by master and servant — is the highest perfection.**

Spontaneous loving service to the Lord is called devotional service with an intimate attachment between the servitor and the served. This intimacy is called *mamatā.* Between the servitor and the served there is a feeling of oneness. This *mamatā* begins with *dāsya-prema,* service rendered to the master by the servant. Unless there is such a relationship, the loving affairs between the Lord and His devotee are not actually fixed. When the devotee feels “The Lord is my master” and renders service unto Him, Kṛṣṇa consciousness is awakened. This fixed consciousness is on a higher platform than simple cognizance of love of Godhead.

### Purport

As long as loving service is rendered to the Lord in the master-servant relationship, there is some fear, for the servant is always afraid of the master, despite the intimacy of self-interest. In this stage the servant is always afraid of the master and respectful of Him. When the devotee is further advanced, he has nothing to fear. He considers the Lord and himself on an equal level. At such a time, the devotee is fully convinced that Lord Kṛṣṇa is a friend and cannot at all be dissatisfied if the devotee lives with Him on an equal level. This understanding is called *viśrambha,* that is, devoid of a respectful attitude. When this attitude is chosen, it becomes *sakhya-prema,* or love of Godhead in friendship. On this stage there is developed consciousness of equality between the Lord and the devotee.

And what pious activities did mother Yaśodā perform that made the Absolute Supreme Personality of Godhead Kṛṣṇa call her “Mother” and suck her breasts?’**

### Purport

This is a statement from *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (10.9.20). Kṛṣṇa agreed to be bound by mother Yaśodā after she had given up trying to bind Kṛṣṇa with ropes. This is another appreciation made by Śukadeva Gosvāmī in his narration of the pastimes of Kṛṣṇa before Mahārāja Parīkṣit.

### Translation

**The Lord said, “Your statements are certainly getting better and better one after the other, but surpassing all of them is another transcendental mellow, and you can speak of that as the most sublime.”**

### Purport

**Rāmānanda Rāya then replied, “Conjugal attachment for Kṛṣṇa is the topmost position in love of Godhead.**

In general, love of Godhead is devoid of the intimacy of ownership. In the case of love in servitude, there is a want of confidence. There is a want of increased affection in the fraternal relationship, and even when this affection increases in the parental relationship, there is nonetheless a want of complete freedom. However, when one becomes a conjugal lover of Kṛṣṇa, everything lacking in the other relationships is completely manifest. Love of Godhead lacks nothing in the conjugal stage. The summary of this verse is that parental love of Godhead is certainly higher than fraternal love and that conjugal love is higher yet. It was when Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu requested Rāmānanda Rāya to go further that he came to the point of the conjugal relationship, which is the highest perfectional stage of transcendental love.

**“ ‘When Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa was dancing with the gopīs in the rāsa-līlā, the gopīs were embraced around the neck by the Lord’s arms. This transcendental favor was never bestowed upon the goddess of fortune or the other consorts in the spiritual world. Nor was such a thing ever imagined by the most beautiful girls in the heavenly planets, girls whose bodily luster and aroma resemble the beauty and fragrance of lotus flowers. And what to speak of worldly women, who may be very, very beautiful according to material estimation?’**

### Purport

This verse (*Bhāg.* 10.47.60) was spoken by Uddhava when he visited Śrī Vṛndāvana to deliver a message from Kṛṣṇa to the *gopīs.* Uddhava remained in Vṛndāvana to observe the activities of the *gopīs* there. When he saw the ecstatic love for Kṛṣṇa in separation manifested by the *gopīs,* he appreciated their supreme love and therefore expressed his feelings in this verse. He admitted that the fortune of the *gopīs* could not be compared even to the fortune of the goddess of fortune, to say nothing of the beautiful girls in the heavenly planets.

### Purport

In this regard, Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura explains that this verse does not advocate the whimsical invention of some methods of love of Godhead. Such inventions cannot be accepted as topmost. Indeed, such concoctions are not recommended in these verses. Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī has said in the *Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu* (1.2.101):

*śruti-smṛti-purāṇādi-* *pañcarātra-vidhiṁ vinā  
aikāntikī harer bhaktir* *utpātāyaiva kalpate*

He clearly mentions in this verse that one must refer to the Vedic literatures and other, supplementary literatures and follow the conclusion of the *Vedas.* An invented devotional attitude simply creates disturbances in the transcendental realm. If a person overly addicted to family life takes to *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* or Kṛṣṇa consciousness to earn a livelihood, his activity is certainly offensive. One should not become a caste *guru* and sell *mantras* for the benefit of mundane customers, nor should one make disciples for a livelihood. All these activities are offensive. One should not make a livelihood by forming a professional band to carry out congregational chanting, nor should one perform devotional service when one is attached to mundane society, friendship and love. Nor should one be dependent on so-called social etiquette. All of this is mental speculation. None of these things can be compared to unalloyed devotional service. No one can compare unalloyed devotional service, Kṛṣṇa consciousness, to mundane activities. There are many unauthorized parties pretending to belong to the Śrī Caitanya cult, and some are known as *āula, bāula, kartābhajā, neḍā, daraveśa, sāṅi, sahajiyā sakhībhekī, smārta, jāta-gosāñi, ativāḍī, cūḍādhārī* and *gaurāṅga-nāgarī.*

Moreover, there are those who take the caste *gosvāmīs’* opinions of such parties as bona fide, comparing these opinions to those of the six Gosvāmīs, headed by Śrī Rūpa and Śrī Sanātana. This is simply another cheating process. There are also nondevotees who compose unauthorized songs, who establish different temples for money, who worship the Deity as priests for salaries, who accept caste brahmanism as all in all, and who do not know the value of a pure Vaiṣṇava. Actually the caste *brāhmaṇas* of the *smārta* community are opposed to the principles of the *Sātvata-pañcarātra.* Furthermore, there are many Māyāvādīs and those overly addicted to material sense enjoyment. None of these can be compared to a person who is purely engaged in preaching Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Every Kṛṣṇa conscious person is constantly endeavoring to utilize different transcendental devices in the service of the Lord. Such a devotee renounces all material enjoyment and completely dedicates himself to the service of his spiritual master and Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. He may be a perfect celibate, a restrained householder, a regulated *vānaprastha* or a *tridaṇḍi-sannyāsī* in the renounced order. It doesn’t matter. The pseudo transcendentalists and the pure devotees cannot be compared, nor can one argue that a person can invent his own way of worship.

The purport in presenting this verse necessitates explaining the comparative positions of the transcendental mellows known as *śānta, dāsya, sakhya, vātsalya* and *mādhurya.* All these *rasas,* or mellows, are situated on the transcendental platform. Pure devotees take shelter of one of them and thus progress in spiritual life. Actually one can take shelter of such spiritual mellows only when one is completely uncontaminated by material attachment. When one is completely free from material attachment, the feelings of the transcendental mellows are awakened in the heart of the devotee. That is *svarūpa-siddhi,* the perfection of one’s eternal relationship with the Supreme Lord. *Svarūpa-siddhi,* the eternal relationship with the Supreme Lord, may be situated in any one of the transcendental mellows. Each and every one of them is as perfect as the others. But by comparative study an unbiased person can realize that the mellow of servitorship is better than the mellow of neutrality, that the mellow of fraternity is better than the mellow of servitorship, that the parental mellow is better than that of fraternity, and that above all other mellows is the mellow of conjugal love. However, these are all spiritually situated on the same platform because all these relationships of perfection in love are based on a central point — Kṛṣṇa.

These mellows cannot be compared to the feelings one derives from demigod worship. Kṛṣṇa is one, but the demigods are different. They are material. Love for Kṛṣṇa cannot be compared to material love for different demigods. Because Māyāvādīs are on the material platform, they recommend the worship of Śiva or Durgā and say that worship of Kālī and Kṛṣṇa are the same. However, on the spiritual platform there is no demigod worship. The only worshipable object is Kṛṣṇa. Therefore although there is no difference between a devotee in *śānta-rasa* or *dāsya-rasa, vātsalya-rasa* or *mādhurya-rasa,* one can still make a comparative study of the intensity of love in these different transcendental positions. For example, it may be said that *dāsya-rasa* is better than *śānta-rasa,* yet transcendental love of God is there in both of them. Similarly, we can judge that love of Godhead in fraternity is better than love of Godhead in neutrality and servitorship. Similarly, love of Godhead in parental affection is better than love in fraternity. And, as stated before, love of God in the conjugal *rasa* is superior to that in the parental *rasa.*

The analysis of different types of love of Godhead has been made by expert *ācāryas* who know all about devotional service on the transcendental platform. Unfortunately, inexperienced and unauthorized persons in the mundane world, not understanding the transcendental position of pure love, try to find some material fault in the transcendental process. This is simply impudence on the part of spiritually inexperienced people. Such faultfinding is symptomatic of unfortunate mundane wranglers.

### Translation

**“Complete attainment of the lotus feet of Lord Kṛṣṇa is made possible by love of Godhead, specifically mādhurya-rasa, or conjugal love. Lord Kṛṣṇa is indeed captivated by this standard of love. This is stated in Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.**

### Purport

To explain the topmost quality of conjugal love, Śrīla Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī gives the example of the material elements — sky, air, fire, water and earth. In the sky (space) there is the quality of sound. Similarly, in air there are the qualities of sound and touch. In fire, there are three qualities — sound, touch and form. In water there are four qualities — sound, touch, form and taste. Finally, in earth there are all five qualities — sound, touch, form, taste and also smell. Now, one can see that the quality of the sky is in all — namely in air, fire, water and earth. In earth we can find all the qualities of material nature. The same can be applied to the *rasa* known as *mādhurya-rasa,* or conjugal love. In conjugal love there are the qualities of neutrality, servitorship, fraternity and parental affection, as well as those of conjugal love itself. The conclusion is that through conjugal love the Lord is completely satisfied.

Conjugal love (*mādhurya-rasa*) is also known as *śṛṅgāra-rasa.* It is the conclusion of *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* that in the complete combination of loving service to the Lord — namely in conjugal love — the Supreme Lord fully agrees to be under the control of the devotee. The highest form of conjugal love is represented by Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī; therefore in the pastimes of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa we can see that Kṛṣṇa is always subjugated by Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī’s influence.

### Purport

It is a completely mistaken idea that one can worship Kṛṣṇa in any form or in any way and still attain the ultimate result of receiving the favor of the Lord. This is a decision made by gross materialists. Generally such men say that you can manufacture your own way of worshiping the Supreme Lord and that any type of worship is sufficient to approach the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Certainly there are different means for attaining different results in fruitive activity, speculative knowledge, mystic *yoga* and austerity. Crude men therefore say that one who adopts any of these methods achieves the Supreme Personality of Godhead’s favor. They claim that it doesn’t matter what kind of method one adopts. A general example is given: If one wishes to arrive at a certain place, there are many roads leading there, and one can go to that place by any one of these roads. Similarly, these gross materialists say, there are different ways to attain the favor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. They claim that one can conceive of the Supreme Personality of Godhead as goddess Durgā, goddess Kālī, Lord Śiva, demigod Gaṇeśa, Lord Rāmacandra, Kṛṣṇa, the impersonal Brahman or whatever, and one can chant the Lord’s name in any way and in any form. Such materialists claim that since ultimately all these names and forms are one, the result is the same. They also give the example that a man who has different names will answer if called by any one of them. Therefore, they claim, there is no need to chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra.* If one chants the name of Kālī, Durgā, Śiva, Gaṇeśa or anyone else, the result will be the same.

Such claims made by mental speculators are no doubt very pleasing to mental speculators, but those who are actually in knowledge do not admit such conclusions, which are against the authority of the *śāstras.* A bona fide *ācārya* will certainly not accept such a conclusion. As Kṛṣṇa clearly states in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (9.25):

*yānti deva-vratā devān* *pitṝn yānti pitṛ-vratāḥ  
bhūtāni yānti bhūtejyā* *yānti mad-yājino ’pi mām*

“Those who worship the demigods will take birth among the demigods, those who worship the ancestors go to the ancestors, those who worship ghosts and spirits will take birth among such beings, and those who worship Me will live with Me.”

Only the devotees of the Lord can be admitted to His kingdom — not the demigod worshipers, *karmīs, yogīs* or anyone else. A person who desires elevation to the heavenly planets worships various demigods, and material nature may be pleased to offer such devotees their desired positions. The material nature gives a person his own nature, by which he increases affection for different types of demigods. However, the *Bhagavad-gītā* (7.20) says that demigod worship is meant for men who have lost all their intelligence:

*kāmais tais tair hṛta-jñānāḥ* *prapadyante ’nya-devatāḥ  
taṁ taṁ niyamam āsthāya* *prakṛtyā niyatāḥ svayā*

“Those whose intelligence has been stolen by material desires surrender unto demigods and follow the particular rules and regulations of worship according to their own natures.”

Although one may be elevated to the heavenly planets, the results of such a benediction are limited:

*anta-vat tu phalaṁ teṣāṁ* *tad bhavaty alpa-medhasām  
devān deva-yajo yānti* *mad-bhaktā yānti mām api*

“Men of small intelligence worship the demigods, and their fruits are limited and temporary. Those who worship the demigods go to the planets of the demigods, but My devotees ultimately reach My supreme planet.” (Bg. 7.23)

Being elevated to the heavenly planets or other material planets does not mean attaining an eternal life of knowledge and bliss. At the end of the material world, all attainments of material elevation will also end. Again, according to Kṛṣṇa in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (18.55), only those who engage in His loving devotional service will be admitted to the spiritual world and return to Godhead, not others:

*bhaktyā mām abhijānāti* *yāvān yaś cāsmi tattvataḥ  
tato māṁ tattvato jñātvā* *viśate tad-anantaram*

“One can understand Me as I am, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, only by devotional service. And when one is in full consciousness of Me by such devotion, he can enter into the kingdom of God.”

Impersonalists cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead; therefore it is not possible for them to enter into the spiritual kingdom of God and return home, back to Godhead. Actually one attains different results by different means. It is not that all achievements are one and the same. Those interested in the four principles of *dharma, artha, kāma* and *mokṣa* cannot be compared to those interested in the unalloyed devotional service of the Lord. *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (1.1.2) therefore says:

*dharmaḥ projjhita-kaitavo ’tra paramo nirmatsarāṇāṁ satāṁ *
 *vedyaṁ vāstavam atra vastu śiva-daṁ tāpa-trayonmūlanam  
śrīmad-bhāgavate mahā-muni-kṛte kiṁ vā parair īśvaraḥ *
 *sadyo hṛdy avarudhyate ’tra kṛtibhiḥ śuśrūṣubhis tat-kṣaṇāt*

“Completely rejecting all religious activities which are materially motivated, this *Bhāgavata Purāṇa* propounds the highest truth, which is understandable by those devotees who are pure in heart. The highest truth is reality distinguished from illusion for the welfare of all. Such truth uproots the threefold miseries. This beautiful *Bhāgavatam,* compiled by the great sage Śrī Vyāsadeva, is sufficient in itself for God realization. As soon as one attentively and submissively hears the message of *Bhāgavatam,* he becomes attached to the Supreme Lord.”

Those who aspire after liberation attempt to merge into the impersonal Brahman. To this end they execute ritualistic religious ceremonies, but *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* considers this a cheating process. Indeed, such people can never dream of returning home, back to Godhead. There is a gulf of difference between the goal of *dharma, artha, kāma* and *mokṣa* and the goal of devotional service.

The goddess Durgā is the superintending deity of this material world, which is made of material elements. The demigods are simply different directors engaged in operating the departments of material activities, and they are under the influence of the same material energy. Kṛṣṇa’s internal potencies, however, have nothing to do with the creation of this cosmic material world. The spiritual world and all spiritual activities are under the direction of the internal, spiritual energy, and such activities are performed by Yogamāyā, the spiritual energy. Yogamāyā is the spiritual or internal energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Those who are interested in being promoted to the spiritual world and engaging in the service of the Lord attain spiritual perfection under the control of Yogamāyā*.* Those who are interested in material promotion engage in ritualistic religious ceremonies and economic development to develop sense gratification. They ultimately attempt to merge into the impersonal existence of the Lord. Such people generally become impersonalists. They are interested in worshiping Lord Śiva or goddess Durgā, but their return is one hundred percent materialistic.

Following the example of the *gopīs,* the devotees sometimes worship the goddess Kātyāyanī, but they understand that Kātyāyanī is an incarnation of Yogamāyā*.* The *gopīs* worshiped Kātyāyanī, Yogamāyā, to attain Kṛṣṇa as their husband. On the other hand, it is stated in the *Sapta-śatī* scripture that a *kṣatriya* king named Suratha and a rich *vaiśya* named Samādhi worshiped material nature in the form of goddess Durgā to attain material perfection. If one tries to mingle the worship of Yogamāyā with that of Mahāmāyā, considering them one and the same, he does not really show very high intelligence. The idea that everything is one is a kind of foolishness indulged in by those with less brain substance. Fools and rascals say that the worship of Yogamāyā and the worship of Mahāmāyā are the same. This conclusion is simply the result of mental speculation, and it has no practical effect. In the material world, sometimes one gives an exalted title to an utterly worthless thing; in Bengal this is known as giving a blind child a name like Padmalocana, which means “lotus-eyed.” One may foolishly call a blind child Padmalocana, but such an appellation does not bear any meaning.

In the spiritual world the Absolute Lord is always identical with His name, fame, form, qualities and pastimes. Such identity is impossible in the material world, where the name of a person is different from the person himself. The Supreme Lord has many holy names like Paramātmā, Brahman and “the creator,” but one who worships the Lord as the creator cannot understand the relationship between a devotee and the Lord in the five types of transcendental mellows, nor can he understand the conception of Kṛṣṇa. One cannot understand the six transcendental opulences of the Lord simply by understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead as impersonal Brahman.

Impersonal realization of the Absolute Truth is certainly transcendental, but this does not mean that one who has attained this realization can understand the *sac-cid-ānanda* form of the Lord. Similarly, Paramātmā realization — realization of the plenary expansion of the Absolute Truth within everyone’s heart — is also an incomplete understanding of the Absolute Truth. Even a devotee of the Personality of Godhead Nārāyaṇa cannot actually understand the transcendental attractive features of Kṛṣṇa. Indeed, a devotee of Kṛṣṇa who is attached to the sublime attractive features of the Lord does not consider Nārāyaṇa very important. When the *gopīs* sometimes saw Kṛṣṇa in the form of Nārāyaṇa, they were not very much attracted to Him. The *gopīs* never addressed Kṛṣṇa as Rukmiṇī-ramaṇa. Kṛṣṇa’s devotees in Vṛndāvana address Him as Rādhāramaṇa, Nandanandana and Yaśodānandana, but not as Vasudeva-nandana or Devakī-nandana. Although according to the material conception Nārāyaṇa, Rukmiṇī-ramaṇa and Kṛṣṇa are one and the same, in the spiritual world one cannot use the name Rukmiṇī-ramaṇa or Nārāyaṇa in place of the name Kṛṣṇa. If one does so out of a poor fund of knowledge, his mellow with the Lord becomes spiritually faulty and is called *rasābhāsa,* an overlapping of transcendental mellows. The advanced devotee who has actually realized the transcendental features of the Lord will not commit the mistake of creating a *rasābhāsa* situation by using one name for another. Because of the influence of Kali-yuga, there is much *rasābhāsa* in the name of extravagance and liberal-mindedness. Such fanaticism is not very much appreciated by pure devotees.

Kṛṣṇa and His devotees become perfectly intimate in conjugal love of Godhead. In other mellows, the Lord and the devotees do not enjoy transcendental bliss as perfectly. The next verse (*Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* 10.33.6) will illustrate this point.

### Purport

The name Rādhā is derived from this verse (*Bhāg.* 10.30.28), from the words *anayārādhitaḥ,* meaning “by Her the Lord is worshiped.” Sometimes the critics of *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* find it difficult to find Rādhārāṇī’s holy name in that book, but the secret is disclosed here in the word *ārādhita,* from which the name Rādhā has come. Of course, the name of Rādhārāṇī is directly mentioned in other *Purāṇas.* This *gopī’s* worship of Kṛṣṇa is topmost, and therefore Her name is Rādhā, or “the topmost worshiper.”

During the *rāsa* dance, one form of Kṛṣṇa was between every two *gopīs.* But by the side of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī there was only one Kṛṣṇa. Although this was the case, Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī still manifested disagreement with Kṛṣṇa. This verse is from the *Ujjvala-nīlamaṇi* (*Śṛṅgāra-bheda-kathana* 102), written by Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī.

Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura explains that a mundane person, being enriched by mundane opulences, must always know that the transcendental opulences of the advanced devotees are far more important than the materialistic opulences of a person like himself. A materialistic person with material opulences should not be very proud or puffed up before a transcendental devotee. If one approaches a transcendental devotee on the strength of one’s material heritage, opulence, education and beauty and does not offer respect to the advanced devotee of the Lord, the Vaiṣṇava devotee may offer formal respects to such a materially puffed-up person, but he may not deliver transcendental knowledge to him. Indeed, the devotee sees him as a non-*brāhmaṇa* or *śūdra.* Such a puffed-up person cannot understand the science of Kṛṣṇa. A proud person is deceived in transcendental life and, despite having attained a human form, will again glide into hellish conditions. By His personal example, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu explains how one should be submissive and humble before a Vaiṣṇava, even though one may be situated on a high platform. Such is the teaching of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu as the *ācārya* of the world, the supreme spiritual master and teacher.

### Translation

**“Whether one is a brāhmaṇa, a sannyāsī or a śūdra — regardless of what he is — he can become a spiritual master if he knows the science of Kṛṣṇa.”**

### Purport

This verse is very important to the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. In his *Amṛta-pravāha-bhāṣya,* Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura explains that one should not think that because Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was born a *brāhmaṇa* and was situated in the topmost spiritual order as a *sannyāsī,* it was improper for Him to receive instructions from Śrīla Rāmānanda Rāya, who belonged to the *śūdra* caste. To clarify this matter, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu informed Rāmānanda Rāya that knowledge of Kṛṣṇa consciousness is more important than caste. In the system of *varṇāśrama-dharma* there are various duties for the *brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas, vaiśyas* and *śūdras.* Actually the *brāhmaṇa* is supposed to be the spiritual master of all other *varṇas,* or classes, but as far as Kṛṣṇa consciousness is concerned, everyone is capable of becoming a spiritual master because knowledge in Kṛṣṇa consciousness is on the platform of the spirit soul. To spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness, one need only be cognizant of the science of the spirit soul. It does not matter whether one is a *brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya, śūdra, sannyāsī, gṛhastha* or whatever. If one simply understands this science, he can become a spiritual master.

It is stated in the *Hari-bhakti-vilāsa* that one should not accept initiation from a person who is not in the brahminical order if there is a fit person in the brahminical order present. This instruction is meant for those who are overly dependent on the mundane social order and is suitable for those who want to remain in mundane life. If one understands the truth of Kṛṣṇa consciousness and seriously desires to attain transcendental knowledge for the perfection of life, he can accept a spiritual master from any social status, provided the spiritual master is fully conversant with the science of Kṛṣṇa. Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura also states that although one is situated as a *brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya, śūdra, brahmacārī, vānaprastha, gṛhastha* or *sannyāsī,* if he is conversant in the science of Kṛṣṇa he can become a spiritual master as *vartma-pradarśaka-guru, dīkṣā-guru* or *śikṣā-guru.* The spiritual master who first gives information about spiritual life is called the *vartma-pradarśaka-guru,* the spiritual master who initiates according to the regulations of the *śāstras* is called the *dīkṣā-guru,* and the spiritual master who gives instructions for elevation is called the *śikṣā-guru.* Factually the qualifications of a spiritual master depend on his knowledge of the science of Kṛṣṇa. It does not matter whether he is a *brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, sannyāsī* or *śūdra.* This injunction given by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is not at all against the injunctions of the *śāstras.* In the *Padma Purāṇa* it is said:

*na śūdrā bhagavad-bhaktās* *te ’pi bhāgavatottamāḥ  
sarva-varṇeṣu te śūdrā* *ye na bhaktā janārdane*

One who is actually advanced in spiritual knowledge of Kṛṣṇa is never a *śūdra,* even though he may have been born in a *śūdra* family. However, even if a *vipra,* or *brāhmaṇa,* is very expert in the six brahminical activities (*paṭhana, pāṭhana, yajana, yājana, dāna, pratigraha*) and is also well versed in the Vedic hymns, he cannot become a spiritual master unless he is a Vaiṣṇava. But if one is born in the family of *caṇḍālas* yet is well versed in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he can become a *guru.* These are the śāstric injunctions, and strictly following these injunctions, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, as a *gṛhastha* named Śrī Viśvambhara, was initiated by a *sannyāsī-guru* named Īśvara Purī. Similarly, Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu was initiated by Mādhavendra Purī, a *sannyāsī.* According to others, however, He was initiated by Lakṣmīpati Tīrtha. Advaita Ācārya, although a *gṛhastha,* was initiated by Mādhavendra Purī, and Śrī Rasikānanda, although born in a *brāhmaṇa* family, was initiated by Śrī Śyāmānanda Prabhu, who was not born in a caste *brāhmaṇa* family. There are many instances in which a born *brāhmaṇa* took initiation from a person who was not born in a *brāhmaṇa* family. The brahminical symptoms are explained in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (7.11.35), wherein it is stated:

*yasya yal-lakṣaṇaṁ proktaṁ* *puṁso varṇābhivyañjakam  
yad anyatrāpi dṛśyeta* *tat tenaiva vinirdiśet*

If a person is born in a *śūdra* family but has all the qualities of a spiritual master, he should be accepted not only as a *brāhmaṇa* but as a qualified spiritual master also. This is also the instruction of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura therefore introduced the sacred thread ceremony for all Vaiṣṇavas according to the rules and regulations.

Sometimes a Vaiṣṇava who is a *bhajanānandī* does not take the *sāvitra-saṁskāra* (sacred thread initiation), but this does not mean that this system should be used for preaching work. There are two kinds of Vaiṣṇavas — *bhajanānandī* and *goṣṭhy-ānandī.* A *bhajanānandī* is not interested in preaching work, but a *goṣṭhy-ānandī* is interested in spreading Kṛṣṇa consciousness to benefit the people and increase the number of Vaiṣṇavas. A Vaiṣṇava is understood to be above the position of a *brāhmaṇa.* As a preacher, he should be recognized as a *brāhmaṇa;* otherwise there may be a misunderstanding of his position as a Vaiṣṇava. However, a Vaiṣṇava *brāhmaṇa* is not selected on the basis of his birth but according to his qualities. Unfortunately, those who are unintelligent do not know the difference between a *brāhmaṇa* and a Vaiṣṇava. They are under the impression that unless one is a *brāhmaṇa* he cannot be a spiritual master. For this reason only, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu makes the statement in this verse:

*kibā vipra, kibā nyāsī, śūdra kene naya  
yei kṛṣṇa-tattva-vettā, sei ‘guru’ haya*

If one becomes a *guru,* he is automatically a *brāhmaṇa.* Sometimes a caste *guru* says that *ye kṛṣṇa-tattva-vettā, sei guru haya* means that one who is not a *brāhmaṇa* may become a *śikṣā-guru* or a *vartma-pradarśaka-guru* but not an initiator *guru.* According to such caste *gurus,* birth and family ties are considered foremost. However, the hereditary consideration is not acceptable to Vaiṣṇavas. The word *guru* is equally applicable to the *vartma-pradarśaka-guru, śikṣā-guru* and *dīkṣā-guru.* Unless we accept the principle enunciated by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement cannot spread all over the world. According to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s intentions, *pṛthivīte āche yata nagarādi-grāma sarvatra pracāra haibe mora nāma.* Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s cult must be preached all over the world. This does not mean that people should take to His teachings and remain *śūdras* or *caṇḍālas.* As soon as one is trained as a pure Vaiṣṇava, he must be accepted as a bona fide *brāhmaṇa.* This is the essence of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s instructions in this verse.

Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura has said, *māyāra vaśe, yāccha bhese, khāccha hābuḍubu, bhāi.* A person under the grip of the material energy is carried away by the waves of that illusory energy. In other words, a person in the material world is a servant of *māyā.* However, a person in the spiritual energy is a servant of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Although Rāmānanda Rāya knew that nothing was unknown to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, he nonetheless began to speak further on the subject because the Lord desired it.

*vṛndāvane* — in Vṛndāvana; *aprākṛta* — spiritual; *navīna* — new; *madana* — Cupid; *kāma*-*gāyatrī* — hymns of desire; *kāma*-*bīje* — by the spiritual seed of desire called *klīm*; *yāṅra* — of whom; *upāsana* — the worship.

### Translation

**“In the spiritual realm of Vṛndāvana, Kṛṣṇa is the spiritual, ever-fresh Cupid. He is worshiped by the chanting of the Kāma-gāyatrī mantra, with the spiritual seed klīm.**

### Purport

Vṛndāvana is described in the *Brahma-saṁhitā* (5.56) in this way:

*śriyaḥ kāntāḥ kāntaḥ parama-puruṣaḥ kalpa-taravo *
 *drumā bhūmiś cintāmaṇi-gaṇa-mayī toyam amṛtam  
kathā gānaṁ nāṭyaṁ gamanam api vaṁśī priya-sakhī *
 *cid-ānandaṁ jyotiḥ param api tad āsvādyam api ca*

*sa yatra kṣīrābdhiḥ sravati surabhībhyaś ca su-mahān *
 *nimeṣārdhākhyo vā vrajati na hi yatrāpi samayaḥ  
bhaje śvetadvīpaṁ tam aham iha golokam iti yaṁ *
 *vidantas te santaḥ kṣiti-virala-cārāḥ katipaye*

The spiritual realm of Vṛndāvana is always spiritual. The goddess of fortune and the *gopīs* are always present there. They are Kṛṣṇa’s beloveds, and all of them are as spiritual as Kṛṣṇa. In Vṛndāvana, Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Person and is the husband of all the *gopīs* and the goddess of fortune. The trees in Vṛndāvana are wish-fulfilling trees. The land is made of touchstone, and the water is nectar. Words are musical vibrations, and all movements are dancing. The flute is the Lord’s constant companion. The planet Goloka Vṛndāvana is self-luminous like the sun and is full of spiritual bliss. The perfection of life lies in tasting that spiritual existence; therefore everyone should cultivate its knowledge. In Vṛndāvana, spiritual cows are always supplying spiritual milk. Not a single moment is wasted there — in other words, there is no past, present or future. Not a single particle of time is wasted. Within this material universe, the devotees worship that transcendental abode as Goloka Vṛndāvana. Lord Brahmā himself said, “Let me worship that spiritual land where Kṛṣṇa is present.” This transcendental Vṛndāvana is not appreciated by those who are not devotees or self-realized souls because this Vṛndāvana-dhāma is all spiritual. The pastimes of the Lord there are also spiritual. None are material. According to a prayer by Śrīla Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura (*Prārthanā* 1):

*āra kabe nitāi-cāṅdera karuṇā karibe  
saṁsāra-vāsanā mora kabe tuccha ha’be*

“When will Lord Nityānanda have mercy upon me so that I can realize the uselessness of material pleasure?”

*viṣaya chāḍiyā kabe śuddha ha’be mana  
kabe hāma heraba śrī-vṛndāvana*

“When will my mind be cleansed of all material dirt so that I will be able to feel the presence of spiritual Vṛndāvana?”

*rūpa-raghunātha-pade haibe ākuti  
kabe hāma bujhaba se yugala-pirīti*

“When will I be attracted to the instructions of the Gosvāmīs so that I will be able to understand what is Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa and what is Vṛndāvana?”

These verses indicate that one first has to be purified of all material desires and all attraction for fruitive activity and speculative knowledge if one wishes to understand Vṛndāvana.

In reference to the words *aprākṛta navīna madana, aprākṛta* refers to that which is the very opposite of the material conception. The Māyāvādīs consider this to be zero or impersonal, but that is not the case. Everything in the material world is dull, but in the spiritual world everything is alive. The desire for enjoyment is present both in Kṛṣṇa and in His parts and parcels, the living entities. In the spiritual world, such desires are also spiritual. No one should mistakenly consider such desires to be material. In the material world, if one is sexually inclined and enjoys sex life, he enjoys something temporary. His enjoyment vanishes after a few minutes. However, in the spiritual world the same enjoyment may be there, but it never vanishes. It is continuously enjoyed. In the spiritual world such sex pleasure appears to the enjoyer to be more and more relishable with each new feature. In the material world, however, sex enjoyment becomes distasteful after a few minutes only, and it is never permanent. Because Kṛṣṇa appears very much sexually inclined, He is called the new Cupid in the spiritual world. There is no material inebriety in such desire, however.

*Gāyantaṁ trāyate yasmād gāyatrī tvaṁ tataḥ smṛtā:* one who chants the Gāyatrī *mantra* is gradually delivered from the material clutches. In other words, that which delivers one from material entanglement is called Gāyatrī*.* An explanation of the Gāyatrī *mantra* can be found in the *Madhya-līlā,* chapter twenty-one, text 125:

*kāma-gāyatrī-mantra-rūpa,* *haya kṛṣṇera svarūpa,  
sārdha-cabbiśa akṣara tāra haya  
se akṣara ‘candra’ haya,* *kṛṣṇe kari’ udaya,  
trijagat kailā kāmamaya*

The Kāma-gāyatrī *mantra* is just like a Vedic hymn, but it is the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself. There is no difference between the Kāma-gāyatrī and Kṛṣṇa. Both are composed of twenty-four and a half transcendental syllables (see *Madhya* 21.125-29). The *mantra* depicted in letters is also Kṛṣṇa, and the *mantra* rises just like the moon. Due to this, there is a perverted reflection of desire in human society and among all kinds of living entities. In the *mantra klīṁ kāma-devāya vidmahe puṣpa-bāṇāya dhīmahi tan no ’naṅgaḥ pracodayāt,* Kṛṣṇa is called Kāma-deva, Puṣpa-bāṇa and Anaṅga. Kāma-deva is Madana-mohana, the Deity who establishes our relationship with Kṛṣṇa; Puṣpa-bāṇa (“He who carries an arrow made of flowers”) is Govinda, the Personality of Godhead who accepts our devotional service; and Anaṅga is Gopījana-vallabha, who satisfies all the *gopīs* and is the ultimate goal of life. This Kāma-gāyatrī (*klīṁ kāma-devāya vidmahe puṣpa-bāṇāya dhīmahi tan no ’naṅgaḥ pracodayāt*) simply does not belong to this material world. When one is advanced in spiritual understanding, he can worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead with his spiritually purified senses and fulfill the desires of the Lord.

*man-manā bhava mad-bhakto* *mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru  
mām evaiṣyasi satyaṁ te* *pratijāne priyo ’si me*

“Always think of Me and become My devotee. Worship Me and offer your homage unto Me. Thus you will come to Me without fail. I promise you this because you are My very dear friend.” (Bg. 18.65)

In the *Brahma-saṁhitā* (5.27-28) it is stated:

*atha veṇu-ninādasya* *trayī-mūrti-mayī gatiḥ  
sphurantī praviveśāśu* *mukhābjāni svayambhuvaḥ*

*gāyatrīṁ gāyatas tasmād* *adhigatya saroja-jaḥ  
saṁskṛtaś cādi-guruṇā* *dvijatām agamat tataḥ*

*trayyā prabuddho ’tha vidhir* *vijñāta-tattva-sāgaraḥ  
tuṣṭāva veda-sāreṇa* *stotreṇānena keśavam*

“Then Gāyatrī, mother of the *Vedas,* having been manifested by the divine sound of Śrī Kṛṣṇa’s flute, entered the lotus mouth of Brahmā, the self-born, through his eight earholes. Thus the lotus-born Brahmā received the Gāyatrī *mantra,* which had sprung from the song of Śrī Kṛṣṇa’s flute. In this way he attained twice-born status, having been initiated by the supreme, primal preceptor, Godhead Himself. Enlightened by the recollection of that Gāyatrī, which embodies the three *Vedas,* Brahmā became acquainted with the expanse of the ocean of truth. Then he worshiped Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the essence of all the *Vedas,* with a hymn.”

The vibration of Kṛṣṇa’s flute is the origin of the Vedic hymns. Lord Brahmā, who is seated on a lotus flower, heard the sound vibration of Kṛṣṇa’s flute and was thereby initiated by the Gāyatrī *mantra.*

### Translation

**“The very name Kṛṣṇa means that He attracts even Cupid. He is therefore attractive to everyone — male and female, moving and inert living entities. Indeed, Kṛṣṇa is known as the all-attractive one.**

### Purport

Just as there are many orbs in the material world called stars or planets, in the spiritual world there are many spiritual planets called Vaikuṇṭhalokas. The spiritual universe, however, is situated far, far away from the cluster of material universes. Material scientists cannot even estimate the number of planets and stars within this universe. They are also incapable of traveling to other stars by spaceship. According to the *Bhagavad-gītā* (8.20), there is also a spiritual world:

*paras tasmāt tu bhāvo ’nyo* *’vyakto ’vyaktāt sanātanaḥ  
yaḥ sa sarveṣu bhūteṣu* *naśyatsu na vinaśyati*

“Yet there is another unmanifested nature, which is eternal and is transcendental to this manifested and unmanifested matter. It is supreme and is never annihilated. When all in this world is annihilated, that part remains as it is.”

Thus there is another nature, which is superior to material nature. The word *bhāva* or *svabhāva* refers to nature. The spiritual nature is eternal, and even when all the material universes are destroyed, the planets in the spiritual world abide. They remain exactly as the spirit soul remains even after the annihilation of the material body. That spiritual world is called the *aprākṛta* (antimaterial) world. In this transcendental, spiritual world or universe, the highest planetary system is known as Goloka Vṛndāvana. That is the abode of Lord Kṛṣṇa Himself, who is also all-spiritual. Kṛṣṇa is known there as Aprākṛta-madana. The name Madana refers to Cupid, but Kṛṣṇa is the spiritual Madana. His body is not material like the body of Cupid in this material universe. Kṛṣṇa’s body is all-spiritual — *sac-cid-ānanda-vigraha.* Therefore He is called Aprākṛta-madana. He is also known as Manmatha-madana, which means that He is attractive even to Cupid. Sometimes Kṛṣṇa’s activities and attractive features are misinterpreted by gross materialists who accuse Him of being immoral because He danced with the *gopīs,* but such an accusation results from not knowing that Kṛṣṇa is beyond this material world. His body is *sac-cid-ānanda-vigraha,* completely spiritual. There is no material contamination in His body, and one should not consider His body a lump of flesh and bones. The Māyāvādī philosophers conceive of Kṛṣṇa’s body as material, and this is an abominable, grossly materialistic conception. Just as Kṛṣṇa is completely spiritual, the *gopīs* are also spiritual, and this is confirmed in the *Brahma-saṁhitā* (5.37):

*ānanda-cin-maya-rasa-pratibhāvitābhis *
 *tābhir ya eva nija-rūpatayā kalābhiḥ  
goloka eva nivasaty akhilātma-bhūto *
 *govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi*

“I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord. He resides in His own realm, Goloka, with Rādhā, who resembles His own spiritual figure and who embodies the ecstatic potency (*hlādinī*). Their companions are Her confidantes, who embody extensions of Her bodily form and who are imbued and permeated with ever-blissful spiritual *rasa.*”

The *gopīs* are also of the same spiritual quality (*nija-rūpatayā*) because they are expansions of Kṛṣṇa’s pleasure potency. Neither Kṛṣṇa nor the *gopīs* have anything to do with lumps of matter or the material conception. In the material world the living entity is encaged within a material body, and due to ignorance he thinks that he is the body. Therefore here the enjoyment of lusty desires between male and female is all material. One cannot compare the lusty desires of a materialistic man to the transcendental lusty desires of Kṛṣṇa. Unless one is advanced in spiritual science, he cannot understand the lusty desires between Kṛṣṇa and the *gopīs.* In the *Caitanya-caritāmṛta* the lusty desire of the *gopīs* is compared to gold. The lusty desires of a materialistic man, on the other hand, are compared to iron. At no stage can iron and gold be equal. The living entities — moving and nonmoving — are part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa; therefore they originally have the same kind of lusty desire as His. But when this lusty desire is expressed through matter, it is abominable. When a living entity is spiritually advanced and liberated from material bondage, he can understand Kṛṣṇa in truth. As stated in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (4.9):

*janma karma ca me divyam* *evaṁ yo vetti tattvataḥ  
tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma* *naiti mām eti so ’rjuna*

“One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this material world but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna.”

When one can understand the body of Kṛṣṇa as well as the Lord’s lusty desires, one is immediately liberated. A conditioned soul encaged within the material body cannot understand Kṛṣṇa. As stated in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (7.3):

*manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu* *kaścid yatati siddhaye  
yatatām api siddhānāṁ* *kaścin māṁ vetti tattvataḥ*

“Out of many thousands among men, one may endeavor for perfection, and of those who have achieved perfection, hardly one knows Me in truth.”

The word *siddhaye* indicates liberation. Only after being liberated from material conditioning can one understand Kṛṣṇa. When one can understand Kṛṣṇa as He is (*tattvataḥ*), one actually lives in the spiritual world, although apparently living within the material body. This technical science can be understood when one is actually spiritually advanced.

In his *Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu* (1.2.187), Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī says:

*īhā yasya harer dāsye* *karmaṇā manasā girā  
nikhilāsv apy avasthāsu* *jīvan-muktaḥ sa ucyate*

When a person in this material world desires only to serve Kṛṣṇa with love and devotion, he is liberated, even though functioning within this material world. As the *Bhagavad-gītā* (14.26) confirms:

*māṁ ca yo ’vyabhicāreṇa* *bhakti-yogena sevate  
sa guṇān samatītyaitān* *brahma-bhūyāya kalpate*

“One who engages in full devotional service, unfailing in all circumstances, at once transcends the modes of material nature and thus comes to the level of Brahman.”

Simply by engaging in the loving service of the Lord one can attain liberation. As stated in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (18.54), *brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā na śocati na kāṅkṣati.* A person who is highly advanced in spiritual knowledge and who has attained the *brahma-bhūta* stage neither laments nor hankers for anything material. That is the stage of spiritual realization.

Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura considers the *brahma-bhūta* stage in two divisions — *svarūpa-gata* and *vastu-gata.* One who has understood Kṛṣṇa in truth but is still maintaining some material connection is known to be situated in his *svarūpa,* his original consciousness. When that original consciousness is completely spiritual, it is called Kṛṣṇa consciousness. One who lives in such consciousness is actually living in Vṛndāvana. He may live anywhere; material location doesn’t matter. When by the grace of Kṛṣṇa one thus advances, he becomes completely uncontaminated by the material body and mind and at that time factually lives in Vṛndāvana. That stage is called *vastu-gata.*

One should execute his spiritual activities in the *svarūpa-gata* stage of consciousness. He should also chant such spiritual *mantras* as *oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya,* and the *cin-mayī* Gāyatrī — *klīṁ kṛṣṇāya govindāya gopījana-vallabhāya svāhā,* and *klīṁ kāma-devāya vidmahe puṣpa-bāṇāya dhīmahi tan no ’naṅgaḥ pracodayāt.* These are the Kāmagāyatrī or *kāma-bīja mantras.* One should be initiated by a bona fide spiritual master and worship Kṛṣṇa with these transcendental *mantras.*

As explained by Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī in the previous verse and the current verse:

*vṛndāvane ‘aprākṛta navīna madana’  
kāma-gāyatrī kāma-bīje yāṅra upāsana*

*puruṣa, yoṣit, kibā sthāvara-jaṅgama  
sarva-cittākarṣaka, sākṣāt manmatha-madana*

A person who is properly purified and initiated by the spiritual master worships the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, by chanting this *mantra,* the Kāma-gāyatrī with the *kāma-bīja.* As the *Bhagavad-gītā* (18.65) confirms, one should engage in transcendental worship in order to be fit for being attracted by Kṛṣṇa, the all-attractive:

*man-manā bhava mad-bhakto* *mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru  
mām evaiṣyasi satyaṁ te* *pratijāne priyo ’si me*

“Always think of Me and become My devotee. Worship Me and offer your homage unto Me. Thus you will come to Me without fail. I promise you this because you are My very dear friend.”

Since every living entity is part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa is naturally attractive. Due to the material covering, one’s attraction for Kṛṣṇa is checked. One is not usually attracted by Kṛṣṇa in the material world, but as soon as one is liberated from material conditioning, he is naturally attracted. Therefore it is said in this verse, *sarva-cittākarṣaka:* “Everyone is naturally attracted by Kṛṣṇa.” This attraction is within everyone’s heart, and when the heart is cleansed, that attraction is manifested (*ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanaṁ bhava-mahā-dāvāgni-nirvāpaṇam*).

By virtue of His expanding attractive features, He subjugated the gopīs named Tārakā and Pāli and absorbed the minds of Śyāmā and Lalitā. He is the most attractive lover of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī and is the reservoir of pleasure for devotees in all transcendental mellows.’**

### Purport

Everyone has a particular transcendental mellow by which he loves and serves Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa is the most attractive feature for every kind of devotee. He is therefore called *akhila-rasāmṛta-mūrti,* the transcendental form of attraction for all kinds of devotees, whether the devotee be in the *śānta-rasa, dāsya-rasa, sakhya-rasa, vātsalya-rasa* or *mādhurya-rasa*.

This is the opening verse of the *Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu,* by Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī.

### Translation

**“Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī’s transcendental body is brilliant in luster and full of all transcendental fragrances. Lord Kṛṣṇa’s affection for Her is like a perfumed massage.**

### Purport

*Sugandhi udvartana* refers to a paste made of several perfumes and fragrant oils. This paste is massaged all over the body, and in this way the body’s dirt and perspiration are removed. Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī’s body is automatically perfumed, but when Her body is massaged with the scented paste of Lord Kṛṣṇa’s affection, Her entire body is doubly perfumed and made brilliant and lustrous. This is the beginning of Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī’s description of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī’s transcendental body. This description (found in verses 165-181) is based on a book by Śrīla Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī known as *Premāmbhoja-maranda.* Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura’s translation of the original Sanskrit reads as follows:

“The love of the *gopīs* for Kṛṣṇa is full of transcendental ecstasy. It appears to be a brilliant jewel, and enlightened by such a transcendental jewel, Rādhārāṇī’s body is further perfumed and decorated with *kuṅkuma.* In the morning Her body is bathed in the nectar of compassion, in the afternoon in the nectar of youth, and in the evening in the nectar of luster itself. In this way the bathing is performed, and Her body becomes as brilliant as the *cintāmaṇi* jewel. She is dressed in various kinds of silken garments, one of which is Her natural shyness.

“Her beauty is more and more enhanced, being decorated with the red *kuṅkuma* of beauty itself and the blackish musk of conjugal love. Thus Her body is decorated with different colors. Her ornaments embody the natural symptoms of ecstasy — trembling, tears, jubilation, stunning, perspiration, faltering of the voice, bodily redness, madness and dullness. In this way Her entire body is bedecked with these nine different jewels. Over and above this, the beauty of Her body is enhanced by Her transcendental qualities, which constitute the flower garland hanging on Her body. The ecstasy of love for Kṛṣṇa is known as *dhīrā* and *adhīrā,* sober and restless. Such ecstasy constitutes the covering of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī’s body, and it is adorned by camphor. Her transcendental anger toward Kṛṣṇa is embodied as the arrangement of the hair on Her head, and the *tilaka* of Her great fortune shines on Her beautiful forehead. Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī’s earrings are the holy names of Kṛṣṇa, as well as the hearing of His name and fame. Her lips are always reddish due to the betel nut of ecstatic affection for Kṛṣṇa. The black ointment around Her eyes is Her tricky behavior with Kṛṣṇa brought about by love. Her joking with Kṛṣṇa and gentle smiling constitute the camphor with which She is perfumed. She sleeps in Her room with the aroma of pride, and when She lies down in Her bed, the transcendental variety of Her loving ecstasies is like a jeweled locket in the midst of Her necklace of separation. Her transcendental breasts are covered by Her sari in the form of affection and anger toward Kṛṣṇa. She has a stringed instrument known as a *kacchapī-vīṇā,* which is the fame and fortune that actually dries up the faces and breasts of the other *gopīs.* She always keeps Her hands on the shoulder of Her *gopī* friend, who represents Her youthful beauty, and although She is highly qualified with so many spiritual assets, She is nonetheless affected by the Cupid known as Kṛṣṇa. Thus She is defeated. Śrīla Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī offers his respectful obeisances to Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī, taking a straw in his mouth. Indeed, he prays, ‘O Gāndharvikā, Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī, just as Lord Kṛṣṇa never rejects a surrendered soul, please don’t reject me.’ ” This is a summary translation of the *Premāmbhoja-maranda,* which Kavirāja Gosvāmī quotes.

Thus there are three baths in different kinds of water. Rādhārāṇī then puts on two garments — a lower and an upper garment. The upper garment is pinkish and is Her affection and attraction for Kṛṣṇa, and the lower garment, a blackish silk sari, is Her shyness.

**Rāya Rāmānanda replied, “Lord Kṛṣṇa is dhīra-lalita, for He can always keep His girlfriends in a subjugated state. Thus His only business is enjoying sense gratification.**

### Purport

We should always remember that Kṛṣṇa’s sense gratification is never to be compared to the sense gratification of the material world. As we have already explained, Kṛṣṇa’s sense gratification is just like gold. The perverted reflection of that sense gratification found in the material world is just like iron. The purport is that Kṛṣṇa is not impersonal. He has all the desires that are manifest in the perverted reflection within this material world. However, the qualities are different — one is spiritual, and the other is material. Just as there is a difference between life and death, there is a difference between spiritual sense gratification and material sense gratification.

Although this is factual, you can continue telling Me more if there is anything more to say.” In reply, Rāmānanda Rāya said, “I do not think I have anything to say beyond this, but there is a topic known as *prema-vilāsa-vivarta,* which I may explain to You. I do not know whether it will bring You happiness or not.”

### Translation

**Saying this, Rāmānanda Rāya began to sing a song he had composed, but Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, out of the ecstasy of love of Godhead, immediately covered Rāmānanda’s mouth with His own hand.**

### Purport

The topics that are about to be discussed between Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and Rāmānanda Rāya cannot be understood by a materialistic poet, nor by intelligence or material perception. Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura states that the spiritual mellow can be realized only when one is situated on the transcendental platform beyond the material stage of goodness. That platform is called *viśuddha-sattva* (*sattvaṁ viśuddhaṁ vasudeva-śabditam*). Realization of the *viśuddha-sattva* platform is beyond the pale of the material world and is not perceived by bodily senses or mental speculation. Our identification with the gross body and subtle mind is different from spiritual understanding. Since the intelligence and mind are material, the loving affairs of Śrī Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa are beyond their perception. *Sarvopādhi-vinirmuktaṁ tat-paratvena nirmalam:* when we are free from all material designations and our senses are completely purified by the *bhakti* process, we can understand the sense activities of the Absolute Truth (*hṛṣīkeṇa hṛṣīkeśa-sevanaṁ bhaktir ucyate*).

The spiritual senses are beyond the material senses. A materialist can think only of the negation of material variety; he cannot understand spiritual variety. He thinks that spiritual variety simply contradicts material variety and is a negation or void, but such conceptions cannot even reach the precincts of spiritual realization. The wonderful activities of the gross body and subtle mind are always imperfect. They are below the degree of spiritual understanding and are ephemeral. The spiritual mellow is eternally wonderful and is described as *pūrṇa, śuddha, nitya-mukta* — that is, complete, perfectly pure and eternally liberated from all material conceptions. When we are unable to fulfill our material desires, there is certainly sorrow and confusion. This may be described as *vivarta.* But in spiritual life there is no sorrow, inebriety or imperfection. Śrīla Rāmānanda Rāya was expert in realizing the spiritual activities of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī and Kṛṣṇa, and Rāmānanda’s spiritual experience was placed before Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu as he inquired whether the Lord approved his realization of spiritual truth.

There are three books prominent in this connection. One was written by Bhakta dāsa Bāula and is called *Vivarta-vilāsa.* Another was compiled by Jagadānanda Paṇḍita and is called *Prema-vivarta.* Śrī Rāmānanda Rāya’s book is called *Prema-vilāsa-vivarta.* The *Vivarta-vilāsa* by Bhakta dāsa Bāula is completely different from the other two books. Sometimes a university student or professor tries to study these transcendental literatures and attempts to put forth a critical analysis from the mundane view, with an end to receiving degrees like a Ph.D. Such realization is certainly different from that of Rāmānanda Rāya. If one actually wants to take a Ph.D. degree from Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and be approved by Rāmānanda Rāya, he must first become free from all material designations (*sarvopādhi-vinirmuktaṁ tat-paratvena nirmalam*). A person who identifies with his material body cannot understand these talks between Śrī Rāmānanda Rāya and Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Man-made religious scriptures and transcendental philosophical talks are quite different. Indeed, there is a gulf of difference between the two. This subject matter has been very diligently described by Śrīman Madhvācārya. Since material philosophers are situated in the material conception of life, they are unable to realize the spiritual *prema-vilāsa-vivarta.* They cannot accommodate an elephant upon a dish. Similarly, mundane speculators cannot capture the spiritual elephant within their limited conception. It is just like a frog’s trying to measure the Atlantic Ocean by imagining it so many times larger than his well. Materialistic philosophers and *sahajiyās* cannot understand the talks between Rāmānanda Rāya and Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu concerning the pastimes of Śrī Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa. The only tendency of the impersonalists or the *prākṛta-sahajiyās* is to face the platform of impersonalism. They cannot understand spiritual variegatedness. Consequently, when Rāmānanda Rāya attempted to sing his own verses, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu stopped him by covering his mouth with His own hand.

### Translation

**“ ‘Alas, before We met there was an initial attachment between Us brought about by an exchange of glances. In this way attachment evolved. That attachment has gradually grown, and there is no limit to it. Now that attachment has become a natural sequence between Ourselves. It is not that it is due to Kṛṣṇa, the enjoyer, nor is it due to Me, for I am the enjoyed. It is not like that. This attachment was made possible by mutual meeting. This mutual exchange of attraction is known as manobhava, or Cupid. Kṛṣṇa’s mind and My mind have merged together. Now, during this time of separation, it is very difficult to explain these loving affairs. My dear friend, though Kṛṣṇa might have forgotten all these things, you can understand and bring this message to Him. But during Our first meeting there was no messenger between Us, nor did I request anyone to see Him. Indeed, Cupid’s five arrows were Our via media. Now, during this separation, that attraction has increased to another ecstatic state. My dear friend, please act as a messenger on My behalf, because if one is in love with a beautiful person, this is the consequence.’**

### Purport

These verses were originally composed and sung by Rāmānanda Rāya himself. Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura suggests that during the time of conjugal enjoyment, the attachment might be compared to Cupid himself. However, during the period of separation, Cupid becomes a messenger of highly elevated love. This is called *prema-vilāsa-vivarta.* When there is separation, conjugal enjoyment itself acts like a messenger, and that messenger was addressed by Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī as a friend. The essence of this transaction is that transcendental loving affairs are as relishable during separation as during conjugal enjoyment. When Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī was fully absorbed in love of Kṛṣṇa, She mistook a black *tamāla* tree for Kṛṣṇa and embraced it. Such a mistake is called *prema-vilāsa-vivarta.*

### Purport

Śrīla Sanātana Gosvāmī has advised us to hear about Kṛṣṇa from a Vaiṣṇava. He has explicitly forbidden us to hear from an *avaiṣṇava.*

*avaiṣṇava-mukhodgīrṇaṁ* *pūtaṁ hari-kathāmṛtam  
śravaṇaṁ naiva kartavyaṁ* *sarpocchiṣṭaṁ yathā payaḥ*

Thus quoting from *Padma Purāṇa,* Śrīla Sanātana Gosvāmī warns that one should not hear anything about Kṛṣṇa from an *avaiṣṇava,* however great a mundane scholar he may be. Milk touched by the lips of a serpent has poisonous effects; similarly, talks about Kṛṣṇa given by an *avaiṣṇava* are also poisonous. However, because a Vaiṣṇava is surrendered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, his talks are spiritually potent. In the *Bhagavad-gītā* (10.10) the Supreme Lord says:

*teṣāṁ satata-yuktānāṁ* *bhajatāṁ prīti-pūrvakam  
dadāmi buddhi-yogaṁ taṁ* *yena mām upayānti te*

“To those who are constantly devoted to worshiping Me with love, I give the understanding by which they can come to Me.” When a pure Vaiṣṇava speaks, he speaks perfectly. How is this? His speech is managed by Kṛṣṇa Himself from within the heart. Śrīla Rāmānanda Rāya accepts this benediction from Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu; therefore he admits that whatever he was speaking was not derived from his own intelligence. Rather, everything was coming from Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. According to the *Bhagavad-gītā* (15.15):

*sarvasya cāhaṁ hṛdi sanniviṣṭo *
 *mattaḥ smṛtir jñānam apohanaṁ ca  
vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyo *
 *vedānta-kṛd veda-vid eva cāham*

“I am seated in everyone’s heart, and from Me come remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness. By all the *Vedas,* I am to be known. Indeed I am the compiler of the *Vedānta,* and I am the knower of the *Vedas.*”

All intelligence emanates from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Supersoul within the heart of everyone. Nondevotees want to ask the Supreme Lord for sense gratification; therefore nondevotees come under the influence of *māyā,* the illusory energy. A devotee, however, is directed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead and comes under the influence of *yogamāyā.* Consequently there is a gulf of difference between statements made by a devotee and those made by a nondevotee.

### Translation

**“Without the help of the gopīs, one cannot enter into these pastimes. Only one who worships the Lord in the ecstasy of the gopīs, following in their footsteps, can engage in the service of Śrī Śrī Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa in the bushes of Vṛndāvana. Only then can one understand the conjugal love between Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa. There is no other procedure for understanding.**

### Purport

The means for returning home, for going back to Godhead, is devotional service, but everyone has a different taste in the Lord’s service. One may be inclined to serve the Lord in servitude (*dāsya-rasa*), fraternity (*sakhya-rasa*) or parental love (*vātsalya-rasa*), but none of these can enable one to enter into the service of the Lord in conjugal love. To attain such service, one has to follow in the footsteps of the *gopīs* in the ecstasy of *sakhī-bhāva.* Then only can one understand the transcendental mellow of conjugal love.

In the *Ujjvala-nīlamaṇi* (*Sakhī-prakaraṇa* 1), Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī advises:

*prema-līlā-vihārāṇāṁ *
 *samyag vistārikā sakhī  
viśrambha-ratna-peṭī ca*

One who expands the conjugal love of Kṛṣṇa and His enjoyment among the *gopīs* is called a *sakhī.* Such a person is a confidential *gopī* in the conjugal affairs. Such assistants are like jewels in the form of Kṛṣṇa’s confidantes. The actual business of the *sakhīs* is described thus in *Ujjvala-nīlamaṇi* (*Sakhī-prakaraṇa* 88-91):

*mithaḥ prema-guṇotkīrtis* *tayor āsakti-kāritā  
abhisāro dvayor eva* *sakhyāḥ kṛṣṇe samarpaṇam*

*narmāśvāsana-nepathyaṁ* *hṛdayodghāṭa-pāṭavam  
chidra-saṁvṛtir etasyāḥ* *paty-ādeḥ parivañcanā*

*śikṣā saṅgamanaṁ kāle* *sevanaṁ vyajanādibhiḥ  
tayor dvayor upālambhaḥ* *sandeśa-preṣaṇaṁ tathā*

*nāyikā-prāṇa-saṁrakṣā* *prayatnādyāḥ sakhī-kriyāḥ*

In the conjugal pastimes of Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa is the hero (*nāyaka*), and Rādhikā is the heroine (*nāyikā*). The first business of the *gopīs* is to chant the glories of both the hero and the heroine. Their second business is to gradually create a situation in which the hero may be attracted to the heroine and vice versa. Their third business is to induce both of Them to approach each other. Their fourth business is to surrender unto Kṛṣṇa, the fifth is to create a jovial atmosphere, the sixth to give Them assurance to enjoy Their pastimes, the seventh to dress and decorate both hero and heroine, the eighth to show expertise in expressing Their desires, the ninth to conceal the faults of the heroine, the tenth to cheat their respective husbands and relatives, the eleventh to educate, the twelfth to enable both the hero and heroine to meet at the proper time, the thirteenth to fan the hero and heroine, the fourteenth to sometimes reproach the hero and heroine, the fifteenth to set conversations in motion, and the sixteenth to protect the heroine by various means.

Some materialistic *sahajiyās* who cannot actually understand the pastimes of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa manufacture their own life-styles without referring to authority. Such *sahajiyās* are called *sakhī-bhekī,* and sometimes they are called *gaura-nāgarī.* They believe that the material body, which is fit to be eaten by jackals and dogs, is enjoyable for Kṛṣṇa. Consequently they artificially decorate the material body to attract Kṛṣṇa, thinking themselves *sakhīs.* But Kṛṣṇa is never attracted by the artificial grooming of the material body. As far as Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī and Her *gopīs* are concerned, their bodies, homes, dresses, ornaments, endeavors and activities are all spiritual. All of these are meant to satisfy the spiritual senses of Kṛṣṇa. Indeed, they are so pleasing and endearing to Kṛṣṇa that He is subjugated by the influence of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī and Her friends. They have nothing to do with anything mundane within the fourteen planetary systems of the universe. Although Kṛṣṇa is attractive to everyone, He is nonetheless attracted by the *gopīs* and Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī.

One should not be misled by mental concoctions, supposing his material body to be perfect and deeming oneself a *sakhī.* This is something like *ahaṅgrahopāsanā,* that is, a Māyāvādī’s worship of his own body as the Supreme. Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī has cautioned mundaners to abstain from such conceptions. He also warns that thinking oneself one of the associates of the Supreme without following in the footsteps of the *gopīs* is as offensive as thinking oneself the Supreme. Such thinking is an *aparādha.* One has to practice living in Vṛndāvana by hearing about the talks of the *gopīs* with Kṛṣṇa. However, one should not consider himself a *gopī,* for this is offensive.

### Translation

**“ ‘The pastimes of Śrī Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa are self-effulgent. They are happiness personified, unlimited and all-powerful. Even so, the spiritual humors of such pastimes are never complete without the gopīs, the Lord’s personal friends. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is never complete without His spiritual potencies; therefore unless one takes shelter of the gopīs, one cannot enter into the company of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa. Who can be interested in Their spiritual pastimes without taking their shelter?’**

The *gopīs* are not as pleased when they directly mix with Kṛṣṇa as when they serve to unite Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī with Kṛṣṇa. Their transcendental pleasure lies in uniting Them.”

**“It is to be noted that the natural characteristic of the gopīs is to love the Supreme Lord. Their lusty desire is not to be compared to material lust.

### Purport

Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura says that material lust should never be attributed to Kṛṣṇa, who is full of transcendental knowledge. Material lust cannot be engaged in the service of the Lord, for it is applicable to materialists, not to Kṛṣṇa. Only *prema,* or love of Godhead, is applicable for the satisfaction of Kṛṣṇa. *Prema* is full service rendered unto the Lord. The lusty affairs of the *gopīs* actually constitute the topmost love of Godhead because the *gopīs* never act for their own personal satisfaction. They are simply pleased by engaging other *gopīs* in the service of the Lord. The *gopīs* derive more transcendental pleasure from indirectly engaging other *gopīs* in the service of Kṛṣṇa than from engaging in His service themselves. That is the difference between material lust and love of Godhead. Lust applies to the material world, and love of Godhead applies only to Kṛṣṇa.

### Purport

In all, there are sixty-four items listed for the rendering of service unto Kṛṣṇa, and these are the regulative principles enjoined in the *śāstras* and given by the spiritual master. One has to serve Kṛṣṇa according to these regulative principles, but if one develops spontaneous love for Kṛṣṇa as exhibited in the activities of those who live in Vrajabhūmi, one attains the platform of *rāgānuga-bhakti.* One who has developed this spontaneous love is eligible for elevation to the platform enjoyed by the inhabitants of Vrajabhūmi. In Vrajabhūmi, there are no regulative principles set forth for Kṛṣṇa’s service. Rather, everything is carried out in spontaneous, natural love for Kṛṣṇa. There is no question of following the principles of the Vedic system. Such principles are followed within this material world, and as long as one is on the material platform, he has to execute them. However, spontaneous love of Kṛṣṇa is transcendental. It may seem that the regulative principles are being violated, but the devotee is on the transcendental platform. Such service is called *guṇātīta,* or *nirguṇa,* for it is not contaminated by the three modes of material nature.

### Synonyms

*tāhāte* — in this matter; *dṛṣṭānta* — the example; *upaniṣad* *śruti*-*gaṇa* — the great sages known as the personified *Upaniṣads* or *śrutis*; *rāga*-*mārge* — on the path of spontaneous love; *bhaji’* — worshiping; *pāila* — obtained; *vrajendra*-*nandana* — the lotus feet of Lord Kṛṣṇa.

### Translation

**“Those saintly persons who represent the Upaniṣads are vivid examples of this. By worshiping the Lord on the path of spontaneous love, they attained the lotus feet of Vrajendra-nandana, the son of Nanda Mahārāja.**

### Purport

In the Goloka Vṛndāvana planet, Kṛṣṇa’s servants are headed by Raktaka and Patraka. Kṛṣṇa’s friends are headed by Śrīdāmā, Subala and others. There are also elderly *gopīs* and the cowherd men, headed by Nanda Mahārāja, mother Yaśodā and others. All of these personalities are eternally engaged in the loving service of the Lord in accordance with their specific attachments for Kṛṣṇa. One who wants to return home to serve the Lord directly may be attracted to Kṛṣṇa as a servant, friend, father or mother. If a person continuously serves Kṛṣṇa during this life in a particular ecstasy, upon giving up the material body he attains a spiritual body suitable for serving Kṛṣṇa in terms of his particular attachment. One may serve as a servant, friend, father or mother. In the same way, one who wants to serve Kṛṣṇa in conjugal love can attain a body under the guidance of the *gopīs.* In this connection, the most vivid example is provided by those saintly personalities known as the *śrutis,* who represent the *Upaniṣads.* The *śrutis* understood that without serving Kṛṣṇa and following in the footsteps of the *gopīs* there would be no possibility of their entering the kingdom of God and serving Kṛṣṇa in the mood of conjugal love. Therefore they engaged in spontaneous loving service unto Kṛṣṇa and followed in the footsteps of the *gopīs.*

**“ ‘Great sages conquer the mind and senses by practicing the mystic yoga system and controlling the breath. Thus engaging in mystic yoga, they see the Supersoul within their hearts and ultimately enter into impersonal Brahman. But even the enemies of the Supreme Personality of Godhead attain that position simply by thinking of the Supreme Lord. However, the damsels of Vraja, the gopīs, being attracted by the beauty of Kṛṣṇa, simply wanted to embrace Him and His arms, which are like serpents. Thus the gopīs ultimately tasted the nectar of the lotus feet of the Lord. Similarly, we Upaniṣads can also taste the nectar of His lotus feet by following in the footsteps of the gopīs.’ ”**

### Translation

**“After thinking of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa and Their pastimes for a long time and after getting completely free from material contamination, one is transferred to the spiritual world. There the devotee attains an opportunity to serve Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa as one of the gopīs.**

### Purport

Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura comments that the word *siddha-deha,* “perfected spiritual body,” refers to a body beyond the material gross body composed of five elements and the subtle astral body composed of mind, intelligence and false ego. In other words, one attains a completely spiritual body fit to render service to the transcendental couple Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa: *sarvopādhi-vinirmuktaṁ tat-paratvena nirmalam.*

When one is situated in his spiritual body, which is beyond this gross and subtle material body, he is fit to serve Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa. That body is called *siddha-deha.* The living entity attains a particular type of gross body in accordance with his past activities and mental condition. In this life the mental condition changes in different ways, and the same living entity gets another body in the next life according to his desires. The mind, intelligence and false ego are always engaged in an attempt to dominate material nature. According to that subtle astral body, one attains a gross body to enjoy the objects of one’s desires. According to the activities of the present body, one prepares another subtle body. And according to the subtle body, one attains another gross body. This is the process of material existence. However, when one is spiritually situated and does not desire a gross or subtle body, he attains his original spiritual body. As confirmed by the *Bhagavad-gītā* (4.9): *tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti so ’rjuna.*

One is elevated to the spiritual world by the spiritual body and is situated either in Goloka Vṛndāvana or in another Vaikuṇṭha planet. In the spiritual body there are no longer material desires, and one is fully satisfied by rendering service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa. This is the platform of *bhakti* (*hṛṣīkeṇa hṛṣīkeśa-sevanaṁ bhaktir ucyate*). When the spiritual body, mind and senses are completely purified, one can render service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His consort. In Vaikuṇṭha the consort is Lakṣmī, and in Goloka Vṛndāvana the consort is Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī. In the spiritual body, free from material contamination, one can serve Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa and Lakṣmī-Nārāyaṇa. When one is thus spiritually situated, he no longer thinks of his own personal sense gratification. This spiritual body is called *siddha-deha,* the body by which one can render transcendental service unto Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa. The process is that of engaging the transcendental senses in loving devotional service. This verse specifically mentions, *sakhī-bhāve pāya rādhā-kṛṣṇera caraṇa:* only transcendentally elevated persons in the mood of the *gopīs* can engage in the service of the lotus feet of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa.

**“Unless one follows in the footsteps of the gopīs, he cannot attain the service of the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, the son of Nanda Mahārāja. If one is overcome by knowledge of the Lord’s opulence, he cannot attain the Lord’s lotus feet, even though he is engaged in devotional service.**

### Purport

One can worship Lakṣmī-Nārāyaṇa by the process of *vidhi-mārga,* worshiping the Lord with regulative principles according to the instructions of the *śāstra* and the spiritual master. But the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa, cannot be directly worshiped by this process. The dealings between Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa and the *gopīs* are devoid of the opulences of Lakṣmī-Nārāyaṇa. The process of *vidhi-mārga,* following the regulative principles, is utilized in the worship of Lakṣmī-Nārāyaṇa, whereas the process of spontaneous service — following in the footsteps of the *gopīs,* who are the denizens of Vṛndāvana — is transcendentally more advanced and is the process whereby Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa are worshiped. One cannot attain this elevated position while worshiping the Lord in His opulence. Those attracted by the conjugal love between Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa must follow in the footsteps of the *gopīs.* Only then is it possible to enter into the Lord’s service in Goloka Vṛndāvana and directly associate with Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa.

### Translation

**On one occasion the Lord inquired, “Of all types of education, which is the most important?”**

### Purport

**Rāmānanda Rāya replied, “No education is important other than the transcendental devotional service of Kṛṣṇa.”**

texts 245 to 257 are all questions and answers between Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and Rāmānanda Rāya. In these exchanges there is an attempt to show the difference between material and spiritual existence. Education in Kṛṣṇa consciousness is always transcendental and is the best of all forms of education. Material education aims at increasing the activities of material sense gratification. Beyond material sense gratification is another negative form of knowledge called *brahma-vidyā,* or impersonal transcendental knowledge. But beyond that *brahma-vidyā,* or knowledge of the impersonal Brahman, is knowledge of devotional service to the Supreme Lord, Viṣṇu. This knowledge is higher. And higher still is devotional service to Lord Kṛṣṇa, which is the topmost form of education. According to *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (4.29.49), *tat karma hari-toṣaṁ yat sā vidyā tan-matir yayā:* “Work meant for pleasing the Supreme Lord is the best, and education that enhances one’s Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the best.”

Also, according to *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (7.5.23-24):

*śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ* *smaraṇaṁ pāda-sevanam  
arcanaṁ vandanaṁ dāsyaṁ* *sakhyam ātma-nivedanam*

*iti puṁsārpitā viṣṇau* *bhaktiś cen nava-lakṣaṇā  
kriyeta bhagavaty addhā* *tan manye ’dhītam uttamam*

This is a statement given by Prahlāda Mahārāja in answer to a question raised by his father. Prahlāda Mahārāja said, “To hear or chant about Lord Viṣṇu, to remember Him, to serve His lotus feet, to worship Him, to offer prayers to Him, to become His servant and His friend, to sacrifice everything for His service — all these are varieties of devotional service. One who is engaged in such activities is understood to be educated to the topmost perfection.”

‘कीर्तिगणम्मध्ये जीवेर कोन् वड़ कीर्ति?’

### Verse text

*‘kīrti-gaṇa-madhye jīvera kon baḍa kīrti?’  
‘kṛṣṇa-bhakta baliyā yāṅhāra haya khyāti’*

### Synonyms

*kīrti*-*gaṇa*-*madhye* — among glorious activities; *jīvera* — of the living entity; *kon* — which; *baḍa* — greatest; *kīrti* — glory; *kṛṣṇa*-*bhakta* — a devotee of Lord Kṛṣṇa; *baliyā* — as; *yāṅhāra* — of whom; *haya* — there is; *khyāti* — the reputation.

### Translation

**Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu then asked Rāmānanda Rāya, “Out of all glorious activities, which is the most glorious?”**

### Purport

**Rāmānanda Rāya replied, “That person who is reputed to be a devotee of Lord Kṛṣṇa enjoys the utmost fame and glory.”**

The greatest reputation a living being can have is to be a devotee of Kṛṣṇa and to act in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. In the material world everyone is trying to be famous by accumulating a large bank balance or material opulence. There is a steady competition among *karmīs* attempting to advance in a wealthy society. The whole world is turning in accordance with that competitive mood. But this kind of name and fame is temporary, for it lasts only as long as the temporary material body exists. One may become famous as a *brahma-jñānī,* an impersonalist scholar, or one may become a materially opulent person. In either case, such reputations are inferior to the reputation of Kṛṣṇa’s devotee. In the *Garuḍa Purāṇa* it is said:

*kalau bhāgavataṁ nāma* *durlabhaṁ naiva labhyate  
brahma-rudra-padotkṛṣṭaṁ* *guruṇā kathitaṁ mama*

“In this Age of Kali, the fame of one who is known as a great devotee is very rare. However, such a position is superior to that of the great demigods like Brahmā and Mahādeva. This is the opinion of all spiritual masters.”

In the *Itihāsa-samuccaya,* Nārada tells Puṇḍarīka:

*janmāntara-sahasreṣu* *yasya syād buddhir īdṛśī  
dāso ’haṁ vāsudevasya* *sarvāḻ lokān samuddharet*

“After many, many births, when a person realizes that he is the eternal servant of Vāsudeva, he can deliver all the worlds.”

In the *Ādi Purāṇa,* in a conversation between Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna, it is said, *bhaktānām anugacchanti muktayaḥ śrutibhiḥ saha:* “The most exalted position of liberation is given by Vedic knowledge. Everyone follows in the footsteps of the devotee.” Similarly, in the *Bṛhan-nāradīya Purāṇa* it is further stated, *adyāpi ca muni-śreṣṭhā brahmādyā api devatāḥ:* “Until now, even the great demigods like Brahmā and Lord Śiva did not know the influence of a devotee.” The *Garuḍa Purāṇa* similarly states:

*brāhmaṇānāṁ sahasrebhyaḥ* *satra-yājī viśiṣyate  
satra-yājī-sahasrebhyaḥ* *sarva-vedānta-pāragaḥ*

*sarva-vedānta-vit-koṭyā* *viṣṇu-bhakto viśiṣyate  
vaiṣṇavānāṁ sahasrebhya* *ekānty eko viśiṣyate*

“It is said that out of thousands of *brāhmaṇas,* one is qualified to perform sacrifices, and out of many thousands of such qualified *brāhmaṇas* expert in sacrificial offerings, one learned *brāhmaṇa* may have passed beyond all Vedic knowledge. He is considered the best among all these *brāhmaṇas.* And yet, out of thousands of such *brāhmaṇas* who have surpassed Vedic knowledge, one person may be a *viṣṇu-bhakta,* and he is most famous. Out of many thousands of such Vaiṣṇavas, one who is completely fixed in the service of Lord Kṛṣṇa is most famous. Indeed, a person who is completely devoted to the service of the Lord certainly returns home, back to Godhead.”

There is also the following statement in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (3.13.4):

*śrutasya puṁsāṁ sucira-śramasya *
 *nanv añjasā sūribhir īḍito ’rthaḥ  
tat-tad-guṇānuśravaṇaṁ mukunda- *
 *pādāravindaṁ hṛdayeṣu yeṣām*

“After much hard labor, a person highly learned in Vedic literature certainly becomes very famous. However, one who is always hearing and chanting the glories of the lotus feet of Mukunda within his heart is certainly superior.”

In the *Nārāyaṇa-vyūha-stava* it is said:

*nāhaṁ brahmāpi bhūyāsaṁ* *tvad-bhakti-rahito hare  
tvayi bhaktas tu kīṭo ’pi* *bhūyāsaṁ janma-janmasu*

“I do not aspire to take birth as a Brahmā if that Brahmā is not a devotee of the Lord. I shall be satisfied simply to take birth as an insect if I am given a chance to remain in the house of a devotee,”

There are many similar verses in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,* especially 3.25.38, 4.24.29, 4.31.22, 7.9.24, and 10.14.30.

It was Lord Śiva who said, “I do not know the truth about Kṛṣṇa, but a devotee of Lord Kṛṣṇa knows all the truth. Out of all the devotees of Lord Kṛṣṇa, Prahlāda is the greatest.”

Above Prahlāda, the Pāṇḍavas are supposedly more advanced. Above the Pāṇḍavas are the members of the Yadu dynasty, who are even more advanced. In the Yadu dynasty, Uddhava is the furthest advanced, and above Uddhava are the damsels of Vraja-dhāma, the *gopīs* themselves.

In the *Bṛhad-vāmana Purāṇa,* Lord Brahmā tells Bhṛgu:

*ṣaṣṭi-varṣa-sahasrāṇi* *mayā taptaṁ tapaḥ purā  
nanda-gopa-vraja-strīṇāṁ* *pāda-reṇūpalabdhaye*

“I underwent meditation and austerities for sixty thousand years just to understand the dust of the lotus feet of the *gopīs.* Still, I could not understand it. To say nothing of me, even Lord Śiva, Lord Śeṣa and the goddess of fortune, Lakṣmī, could not understand it.”

In the *Ādi Purāṇa* the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself says:

*na tathā me priyatamo* *brahmā rudraś ca pārthiva  
na ca lakṣmīr na cātmā ca* *yathā gopī-jano mama*

“Lord Brahmā, Lord Śiva, the goddess of fortune and even My own self are not as dear to Me as the *gopīs.*” Of all the *gopīs,* Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī is the topmost. Rūpa Gosvāmī and Sanātana Gosvāmī are the most exalted servitors of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī and Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Those who adhere to their service are known as *rūpānuga* devotees. The *Caitanya-candrāmṛta* (26) gives the following statement about Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī:

*āstāṁ vairāgya-koṭir bhavatu śama-dama-kṣānti-maitry-ādi-koṭis *
 *tattvānudhyāna-koṭir bhavatu bhavatu vā vaiṣṇavī bhakti-koṭiḥ  
koṭy-aṁśo ’py asya na syāt tad api guṇa-gaṇo yaḥ svataḥ-siddha āste *
 *śrīmac-caitanyacandra-priya-caraṇa-nakha-jyotir āmoda-bhājām*

The qualities of one engaged in the service of Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu — such as reputation, austerities, penances and knowledge — are not to be compared to the good qualities of others. Such is the perfection of a devotee always engaged in the service of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

*‘sampattira madhye jīvera kon sampatti gaṇi?’  
‘rādhā-kṛṣṇe prema yāṅra, sei baḍa dhanī’*

### Synonyms

*sampattira* — riches; *madhye* — among; *jīvera* — of the living entities; *kon* — what; *sampatti* — the wealth; *gaṇi* — we accept; *rādhā*-*kṛṣṇe* — to Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī and Kṛṣṇa; *prema* — loving service; *yāṅra* — whose; *sei* — he; *baḍa* — very great; *dhanī* — capitalist.

### Translation

**Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu asked, “Of the many capitalists who possess great riches, who is the topmost?”**

### Purport

**Rāmānanda Rāya replied, “He who is richest in love for Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa is the greatest capitalist.”**

Everyone in this material world is attempting to acquire riches to satisfy the senses. Actually no one cares for anything other than acquiring material possessions and maintaining them. The wealthy are generally accepted as the most important personalities in this material world, but when we compare a material man of wealth to one wealthy in devotional service to Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa, the latter is found to be the greatest capitalist. According to *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (10.39.2):

*kim alabhyaṁ bhagavati* *prasanne śrī-niketane  
tathāpi tat-parā rājan* *na hi vāñchanti kiñcana*

“What is difficult for the devotees of Lord Kṛṣṇa, who is the shelter of the goddess of fortune? Although such devotees can obtain anything, O King, they do not desire anything.”

### Translation

**Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu asked, “Of all kinds of distress, what is the most painful?”**

**Śrī Rāmānanda Rāya replied, “Apart from separation from the devotee of Kṛṣṇa, I know of no unbearable unhappiness.”**

### Purport

Concerning this, the Lord states in the Vedic literature:

*mām anārādhya duḥkhārtaḥ* *kuṭumbāsakta-mānasaḥ  
sat-saṅga-rahito martyo* *vṛddha-sevā-paricyutaḥ*

“A person who does not worship Me, who is unduly attached to family and who does not stick to devotional service must be considered a most unhappy person. Similarly, one who does not associate with Vaiṣṇavas, or who does not render service to his superior, is also a most unhappy person.”

There is also the following statement in the *Bṛhad-bhāgavatāmṛta* (1.5.54):

*sva-jīvanādhikaṁ prārthyaṁ* *śrī-viṣṇu-jana-saṅgataḥ  
vicchedena kṣaṇaṁ cātra* *na sukhāṁśaṁ labhāmahe*

“Out of all kinds of desirable things experienced in the life of a living entity, association with the devotees of the Lord is the greatest. When we are separated from a devotee even for a moment, we cannot enjoy happiness.”

‘rādhā-kṛṣṇera prema-keli’ — yei gītera marma’*

### Synonyms

*gāna*-*madhye* — among songs; *kona* *gāna* — which song; *jīvera* — of the living entity; *nija* — his own; *dharma* — religion; *rādhā*-*kṛṣṇera* *prema*-*keli* — the loving affairs of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa; *yei* — which; *gītera* — of the song; *marma* — purport.

### Translation

**Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu next asked Rāmānanda Rāya, “Among many songs, which song is to be considered the actual religion of the living entity?”**

### Purport

**Rāmānanda Rāya replied, “That song describing the loving affairs of Śrī Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa is superior to all other songs.”**

As stated in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (10.33.36):

*anugrahāya bhaktānāṁ* *mānuṣaṁ deham āsthitaḥ  
bhajate tādṛśīḥ krīḍā* *yāḥ śrutvā tat-paro bhavet*

“Lord Kṛṣṇa descends apparently as a human being, and He exhibits His transcendental pastimes in Vṛndāvana so that the conditioned soul may be attracted to hearing His transcendental activities.” Nondevotees are strictly prohibited from participating in songs celebrating the loving affairs of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa. Unless one is a devotee, it is very dangerous to hear the songs about the pastimes of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa that were written by Jayadeva Gosvāmī, Caṇḍīdāsa and other exalted devotees. Lord Śiva drank an ocean of poison, but one should not imitate this. One must first become a pure devotee of Lord Kṛṣṇa. Only then can one enjoy hearing the songs of Jayadeva and relish transcendental bliss. If one simply imitates the activities of Lord Śiva and drinks poison, one will certainly meet with death.

The talks between Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and Rāmānanda Rāya are meant for advanced devotees only. Those who are on the mundane platform and who study these talks in order to put forward some thesis for a Ph.D. will not be able to understand them. Instead, these conversations will have a poisonous effect.

‘राधाकृष्ण-प्रेमकेलि कर्ण-रसाय़न ॥’ २५५ ॥

### Verse text

*‘śravaṇa-madhye jīvera kon śreṣṭha śravaṇa?’  
‘rādhā-kṛṣṇa-prema-keli karṇa-rasāyana’*

### Synonyms

*śravaṇa*-*madhye* — out of all topics for hearing; *jīvera* — of the living entity; *kon* — what; *śreṣṭha* — most important; *śravaṇa* — topic of hearing; *rādhā*-*kṛṣṇa*-*prema*-*keli* — the loving affairs between Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa; *karṇa*-*rasa*-*ayana* — most pleasing to the ear.

### Translation

**Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu asked, “Out of all topics people listen to, which is best for all living entities?”**

### Purport

**Rāmānanda Rāya replied, “Hearing about the loving affairs between Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa is most pleasing to the ear.”**

According to *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (10.33.39):

*vikrīḍitaṁ vraja-vadhūbhir idaṁ ca viṣṇoḥ *
 *śraddhānvito ’nuśṛṇuyād atha varṇayed yaḥ  
bhaktiṁ parāṁ bhagavati pratilabhya kāmaṁ *
 *hṛd-rogam āśv apahinoty acireṇa dhīraḥ*

“He who faithfully hears about the dealings between Lord Kṛṣṇa and the *gopīs* in the *rāsa* dance and he who describes these activities attain to the perfectional stage of devotional service and simultaneously lose material, lusty desires.”

A liberated person who hears about the loving affairs of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa is not inclined to have lusty desires. One mundane rogue once said that when the Vaiṣṇavas chant the name “Rādhā, Rādhā,” he simply remembers a barber’s wife named Rādhā. This is a practical example. Unless one is liberated, he should not try to hear about the loving affairs between Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa. If one is not liberated and listens to a relation of the *rāsa* dance, he may remember his own mundane activities and illicit connections with some woman whose name may also be Rādhā. In the conditioned stage one should not even try to remember such things. By practicing the regulative principles, one should rise to the platform of spontaneous attraction for Kṛṣṇa. Then and only then should one hear about *rādhā-kṛṣṇa-līlā.* Although these affairs may be very pleasing both to conditioned and to liberated souls, the conditioned soul should not try to hear them. The talks between Rāmānanda Rāya and Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu are conducted on the platform of liberation.

### Verse text

### Synonyms

“In this material world the living entity’s only business is to accept the path of *bhakti-yoga* and chant the holy name of the Lord.”

### Verse text

*‘mukti, bhukti vāñche yei, kāhāṅ duṅhāra gati?’  
‘sthāvara-deha, deva-deha yaiche avasthiti’*

### Synonyms

*mukti* — liberation; *bhukti* — sense enjoyment; *vāñche* — desires; *yei* — one who; *kāhāṅ* — where; *duṅhāra* — of both of them; *gati* — the destination; *sthāvara*-*deha* — the body of a tree; *deva*-*deha* — the body of a demigod; *yaiche* — just as; *avasthiti* — situated.

### Translation

**“And what is the destination of those who desire liberation and those who desire sense gratification?” Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu asked.**

### Purport

**Rāmānanda Rāya replied, “Those who attempt to merge into the existence of the Supreme Lord will have to accept bodies like those of trees. And those who are overly inclined toward sense gratification will attain the bodies of demigods.”**

Those who desire liberation by merging into the existence of God do not desire sense gratification within the material world. On the other hand, they have no information about serving the lotus feet of the Lord. Consequently, they are doomed to stand like trees for many thousands of years. Although trees are living entities, they are nonmoving. The liberated soul who merges into the existence of the Lord is no better than the trees. Trees also stand in the Lord’s existence because material energy and the Lord’s energy are the same. Similarly, the Brahman effulgence is also the energy of the Supreme Lord. It is the same whether one remains in the Brahman effulgence or in the material energy because in neither is there spiritual activity. Better situated are those who desire sense gratification and promotion to the heavenly planets. Such people want to enjoy themselves like denizens of heaven in the gardens of paradise. They at least retain their individuality in order to enjoy life. But the impersonalists, who try to lose their individuality, also lose both material and spiritual pleasure. The last destination of the Buddhist philosophers is to become just like a stone, which is immovable and has neither material nor spiritual activity. As far as the hard-working *karmīs* are concerned, *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* states (11.10.23):

*iṣṭveha devatā yajñaiḥ* *svar-lokaṁ yāti yājñikaḥ  
bhuñjīta deva-vat tatra* *bhogān divyān nijārjitān*

“After performing various sacrificial rituals for elevation to the heavenly planets, the *karmīs* go there and enjoy themselves with the demigods to the extent that they have obtained the results of pious activities.”

In the *Bhagavad-gītā* (9.20-21) Lord Kṛṣṇa states:

*trai-vidyā māṁ soma-pāḥ pūta-pāpā *
 *yajñair iṣṭvā svar-gatiṁ prārthayante  
te puṇyam āsādya surendra-lokam *
 *aśnanti divyān divi deva-bhogān*

*te taṁ bhuktvā svarga-lokaṁ viśālaṁ *
 *kṣīṇe puṇye martya-lokaṁ viśanti  
evaṁ trayī-dharmam anuprapannā *
 *gatāgataṁ kāma-kāmā labhante*

“Those who study the *Vedas* and drink *soma* juice, seeking the heavenly planets, worship Me indirectly. Purified of sinful reactions, they take birth on the pious, heavenly planet of Indra, where they enjoy godly delights. When they have thus enjoyed vast heavenly sense pleasure and the results of their pious activities are exhausted, they return to this mortal planet again. Thus those who seek sense enjoyment by adhering to the principles of the three *Vedas* achieve only repeated birth and death.”

Therefore after finishing the results of pious activities, the *karmīs* return to this planet in the form of rain, and they begin their life as grass and plants in the evolutionary process.

अरसज्ञ काक चूषे ज्ञान-निम्वफले ।

### Verse text

*arasa-jña kāka cūṣe jñāna-nimba-phale  
rasa-jña kokila khāya premāmra-mukule*

### Synonyms

*arasa*-*jña* — those who are without mellows; *kāka* — the crows; *cūṣe* — suck; *jñāna* — of knowledge; *nimba*-*phale* — on the bitter *nimba* fruit; *rasa*-*jña* — those who enjoy transcendental mellows; *kokila* — the cuckoos; *khāya* — eat; *prema*-*āmra*-*mukule* — the buds of the mango of love of Godhead.

### Translation

**Rāmānanda Rāya continued, “Those who are devoid of all transcendental mellows are like the crows that suck the juice from the bitter fruits of the nimba tree of knowledge, whereas those who enjoy mellows are like the cuckoos who eat the buds of the mango tree of love of Godhead.”**

### Purport

The speculative process of empiric philosophy is as bitter as the fruit of the *nimba* tree. Tasting this fruit is the business of crows. In other words, the philosophical process of realizing the Absolute Truth is a process taken up by crowlike men. But the cuckoolike devotees have very sweet voices with which to chant the holy name of the Lord and taste the sweet fruit of the mango tree of love of Godhead. Such devotees relish sweet mellows with the Lord.

The heart of Brahmā was enlightened by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is Vedic information given in the *Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad* (6.18):

taṁ ha devam ātma-buddhi-prakāśaṁ *

### Translation

**Rāmānanda Rāya continued, “The Supersoul within everyone’s heart speaks not externally but from within. He instructs the devotees in all respects, and that is His way of instruction.”**

### Purport

Here Śrī Rāmānanda Rāya admits that Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is the Supersoul. It is the Supersoul that inspires the devotee; therefore He is the original source of the Gāyatrī *mantra,* which states, *oṁ bhūr bhuvaḥ svaḥ tat savitur vareṇyaṁ bhargo devasya dhīmahi dhiyo yo naḥ pracodayāt.* Savitā is the original source of all intelligence. That Savitā is Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. This is confirmed in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (2.4.22):

*pracoditā yena purā sarasvatī *
 *vitanvatājasya satīṁ smṛtiṁ hṛdi  
sva-lakṣaṇā prādurabhūt kilāsyataḥ *
 *sa me ṛṣīṇām ṛṣabhaḥ prasīdatām*

“May the Lord, who in the beginning of the creation amplified the potent knowledge of Brahmā from within his heart and inspired him with full knowledge of creation and His own self, and who appeared to be generated from the mouth of Brahmā, be pleased with me.” This was spoken by Śukadeva Gosvāmī when he invoked the blessing of the Supreme Personality of Godhead before delivering *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* to Mahārāja Parīkṣit.

### Translation

**“ ‘O my Lord, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, son of Vasudeva, O all-pervading Personality of Godhead, I offer my respectful obeisances unto You. I meditate upon Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa because He is the Absolute Truth and the primeval cause of all causes of the creation, sustenance and destruction of the manifested universes. He is directly and indirectly conscious of all manifestations, and He is independent because there is no other cause beyond Him. It is He only who first imparted the Vedic knowledge unto the heart of Brahmājī, the original living being. By Him even the great sages and demigods are placed into illusion, as one is bewildered by the illusory representations of water seen in fire, or land seen on water. Only because of Him do the material universes, temporarily manifested by the reactions of the three modes of nature, appear factual, although they are unreal. I therefore meditate upon Him, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, who is eternally existent in the transcendental abode, which is forever free from the illusory representations of the material world. I meditate upon Him, for He is the Absolute Truth.’ ”**

### Translation

**“The mahā-bhāgavata, the advanced devotee, certainly sees everything mobile and immobile, but he does not exactly see their forms. Rather, everywhere he immediately sees manifest the form of the Supreme Lord.”**

### Purport

Due to his deep ecstatic love for Kṛṣṇa, the *mahā-bhāgavata* sees Kṛṣṇa everywhere and nothing else. This is confirmed in the *Brahma-saṁhitā* (5.38): *premāñjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena santaḥ sadaiva hṛdayeṣu vilokayanti.*

As soon as a devotee sees something — be it movable or inert — he immediately remembers Kṛṣṇa. An advanced devotee is advanced in knowledge. This knowledge is very natural to a devotee, for he has already read in the *Bhagavad-gītā* how to awaken Kṛṣṇa consciousness. According to Lord Kṛṣṇa in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (7.8):

*raso ’ham apsu kaunteya* *prabhāsmi śaśi-sūryayoḥ  
praṇavaḥ sarva-vedeṣu* *śabdaḥ khe pauruṣaṁ nṛṣu*

“O son of Kuntī \[Arjuna\], I am the taste of water, the light of the sun and the moon, the syllable *oṁ* in the Vedic *mantras;* I am the sound in ether and ability in man.”

Thus when a devotee drinks water or any other liquid, he immediately remembers Kṛṣṇa. For a devotee there is no difficulty in awakening Kṛṣṇa consciousness twenty-four hours a day. Caitanya Mahāprabhu therefore says here:

*sthāvara jaṅgama dekhe nā dekhe tāra mūrti  
sarvatra haya nija iṣṭa-deva-sphūrti*

A saintly person, an advanced devotee, sees Kṛṣṇa twenty-four hours a day and nothing else. As far as movable and inert things are concerned, a devotee sees them all as transformations of Kṛṣṇa’s energy. As Lord Kṛṣṇa states in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (7.4):

*bhūmir āpo ’nalo vāyuḥ* *khaṁ mano buddhir eva ca  
ahaṅkāra itīyaṁ me* *bhinnā prakṛtir aṣṭadhā*

“Earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence and false ego — all together these eight constitute My separated material energies.”

Actually nothing is separate from Kṛṣṇa. When a devotee sees a tree, he knows that the tree is a combination of two energies — material and spiritual. The inferior energy, which is material, forms the body of the tree; however, within the tree is the living entity, the spiritual spark, which is part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa. This is the superior energy of Kṛṣṇa within this world. Whatever living thing we see is simply a combination of these two energies. When an advanced devotee thinks of these energies, he immediately understands that they are manifestations of the Supreme Lord. As soon as we see the sun rise in the morning, we arise and set about doing our morning duties. Similarly, as soon as a devotee sees the energy of the Lord, he immediately remembers Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa. This is explained in this verse: *sarvatra haya nija iṣṭa-deva-sphūrti.*

A devotee who has purified his existence through devotional service sees only Kṛṣṇa in every step of life. This is also explained in the next verse, which is a quotation from *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (11.2.45).

### Translation

**“ ‘The plants, creepers and trees were full of fruits and flowers due to ecstatic love of Kṛṣṇa. Indeed, being so full, they were bowing down. They were inspired by such deep love for Kṛṣṇa that they were constantly pouring showers of honey. In this way the gopīs saw all the forests of Vṛndāvana.’ ”**

### Purport

This verse (*Bhāg.* 10.35.9) is one of the songs the *gopīs* sang during Kṛṣṇa’s absence. In Kṛṣṇa’s absence the *gopīs* were always absorbed in thought of Him. Similarly, the *mahā-bhāgavata,* the advanced devotee, sees everything as potentially serving the Lord. Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī states:

*prāpañcikatayā buddhyā* *hari-sambandhi-vastunaḥ  
mumukṣubhiḥ parityāgo* *vairāgyaṁ phalgu kathyate*

(*Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu* 1.2.126)

The advanced devotee does not see anything as unconnected with Kṛṣṇa. Unlike the Māyāvādī philosophers, a devotee does not see the material world as false, because he knows that everything in the material world is connected to Kṛṣṇa. A devotee knows how to utilize everything in the service of the Lord, and this is characteristic of the *mahā-bhāgavata.* The *gopīs* saw the plants, creepers and forest trees loaded with fruits and flowers and ready to serve Kṛṣṇa. In this way they immediately remembered their worshipable Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa. They did not simply see plants, creepers and trees the way a mundaner sees them.

### Translation

**Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the reservoir of all pleasure, and Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī is the personification of ecstatic love of Godhead. These two forms had combined as one in Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. This being the case, Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu revealed His real form to Rāmānanda Rāya.**

### Purport

This is described as *rādhā-bhāva-dyuti-suvalitaṁ naumi kṛṣṇa-svarūpam.* Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa was absorbed in the features of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī. This was disclosed to Rāmānanda Rāya when he saw Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. An advanced devotee can understand *śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya, rādhā-kṛṣṇa nahe anya.* Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, being a combination of Kṛṣṇa and Rādhā, is nondifferent from Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa combined. This is explained by Svarūpa Dāmodara Gosvāmī:

*rādhā kṛṣṇa-praṇaya-vikṛtir hlādinī śaktir asmād *
 *ekātmānāv api bhuvi purā deha-bhedaṁ gatau tau  
caitanyākhyaṁ prakaṭam adhunā tad-dvayaṁ caikyam āptaṁ *
 *rādhā-bhāva-dyuti-suvalitaṁ naumi kṛṣṇa-svarūpam*

(Cc. *Ādi* 1.5)

Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa is one. Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa is Kṛṣṇa and Kṛṣṇa’s pleasure potency combined. When Kṛṣṇa exhibits His pleasure potency, He appears to be two — Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa. Otherwise, Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa are one. This oneness may be perceived by advanced devotees through the grace of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. This was the case with Rāmānanda Rāya. One may aspire to attain such a position, but one should not try to imitate the *mahā-bhāgavata.*

### Translation

**After embracing Rāmānanda Rāya, the Lord pacified him, informing him, “But for you, no one has ever seen this form.”**

### Purport

In the *Bhagavad-gītā* (7.25) Lord Kṛṣṇa states:

*nāhaṁ prakāśaḥ sarvasya* *yoga-māyā-samāvṛtaḥ  
mūḍho ’yaṁ nābhijānāti* *loko mām ajam avyayam*

“I am never manifest to the foolish and unintelligent. For them I am covered by My internal potency \[*yogamāyā*\], and so they do not know Me, who am unborn and infallible.”

The Lord always reserves the right of not being exposed to everyone. The devotees, however, are always engaged in the service of the Lord, serving with the tongue by chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra* and tasting *mahā-prasādam.* Gradually the sincere devotee pleases the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the Supreme Lord reveals Himself. One cannot see the Supreme Lord by making personal efforts. Rather, when the Lord is pleased by the service of a devotee, He reveals Himself.

### Translation

**“I have now converted My body and mind into the ecstasy of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī; thus I am tasting My own personal sweetness in that form.”**

### Purport

Gaurasundara here informed Śrī Rāmānanda Rāya, “My dear Rāmānanda Rāya, you were actually seeing a separate person with a fair-complexioned body. Actually I am not fair. Being Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the son of Nanda Mahārāja, I am blackish, but when I come in touch with Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī I become fair-complexioned externally. Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī does not touch the body of anyone but Kṛṣṇa. I taste My own transcendental features by accepting the complexion of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī. Without Rādhārāṇī, one cannot taste the transcendental pleasure of Kṛṣṇa’s conjugal love.” In this regard, Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura comments on the *prākṛta-sahajiyā-sampradāya,* which considers Kṛṣṇa and Lord Caitanya to possess different bodies. They misinterpret the words *gaura aṅga nahe mora* in text 287. From that verse and the present verse we can understand that Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu is nondifferent from Kṛṣṇa. Both are the same Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the form of Kṛṣṇa, the Lord enjoys spiritual bliss and remains the shelter of all devotees, *viṣaya-vigraha.* And in His Gaurāṅga feature Kṛṣṇa tastes separation from Kṛṣṇa in the ecstasy of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī. This ecstatic form is Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya. Śrī Kṛṣṇa is always the transcendental reservoir of all pleasure, and He is technically called *dhīra-lalita.* Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī is the embodiment of spiritual energy, personified as ecstatic love for Kṛṣṇa; therefore only Kṛṣṇa can touch Her. The *dhīra-lalita* aspect is not seen in any other form of the Lord, including Viṣṇu and Nārāyaṇa. Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī is therefore known as Govinda-nandinī and Govinda-mohinī, for She is the only source of transcendental pleasure for Śrī Kṛṣṇa and the only person who can enchant His mind.

### Purport

All these conversations between Rāmānanda Rāya and Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu appear ludicrous to a common man who is not a devotee. The entire world is filled with material conceptions, and people are unable to understand these conversations due to the conditioning of mundane philosophy. Those who are overly attached to mundane activities cannot understand the ecstatic conversations between Rāmānanda Rāya and Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Consequently the Lord requested that Rāmānanda Rāya keep all these conversations secret and not expose them to the general populace. If one is actually advanced in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he can understand these confidential talks; otherwise they appear crazy. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu therefore informed Rāmānanda Rāya that they both appeared like madmen and were therefore on the same platform. It is confirmed in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (2.69):

*yā niśā sarva-bhūtānāṁ* *tasyāṁ jāgarti saṁyamī  
yasyāṁ jāgrati bhūtāni* *sā niśā paśyato muneḥ*

“What is night for all beings is the time of awakening for the self-controlled, and the time of awakening for all beings is night for the introspective sage.”

Sometimes Kṛṣṇa consciousness appears like a type of madness to mundane people, just as the activities of mundaners are considered a form of madness by Kṛṣṇa conscious men.

Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura gives the following summary of the conversations between Rāmānanda Rāya and Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Rāmānanda Rāya replied to five questions of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and these questions and their replies are recorded in verses 57-67. The first answer is compared to copper, the second to a better metal, bell metal, the third to a still better metal, silver, and the fourth to the best metal of all, gold. But the fifth answer is compared to the most valuable gem, touchstone, because it deals with unalloyed devotion, the ultimate goal of devotional life, and illuminates the preceding four subordinate answers.

Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura points out that in Vrajabhūmi there is the Yamunā River with its sandy banks. There are *kadamba* trees, cows, Kṛṣṇa’s sticks with which He herds cows, and Kṛṣṇa’s flute. All of these belong to *śānta-rasa,* the mellow of neutrality in devotional service. There are also the direct servants of Kṛṣṇa, such as Citraka, Patraka and Raktaka, and these are the embodiments of service in the mellow of servitude. There are also friends like Śrīdāmā and Sudāmā, who embody service in fraternity. Nanda Mahārāja and mother Yaśodā are the embodiments of parental love. Above all of these are Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī and Her assistants, the *gopīs* Lalitā, Viśākhā and others, who embody conjugal love. In this way all five mellows — *śānta, dāsya, sakhya, vātsalya* and *mādhurya* — exist eternally in Vrajabhūmi. They are also compared, respectively, to copper, bell metal, silver, gold and touchstone, the basis of all metals. Śrīla Kavirāja Gosvāmī therefore refers to a mine eternally existing in Vṛndāvana, Vrajabhūmi.

Here even Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu set the example in showing how one should offer respects to Hanumānjī.

### Purport

Śrī Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura says that Kṛṣṇa is obtainable for the faithful, but for those who are accustomed to argue, Kṛṣṇa is far, far away. Similarly, these talks between Rāmānanda Rāya and Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu can be understood by a person who has firm faith. Those who are not in the disciplic succession, the *asauta-panthīs,* cannot have faith in these talks. They are always doubting and engaging in mental concoctions. These talks cannot be understood by such whimsical people. Transcendental topics remain far, far away from those engaged in mundane arguments. In this regard, the Vedic *mantras* in the *Kaṭha Upaniṣad* (1.2.9) state, *naiṣā tarkeṇa matir āpaneyā proktānyenaiva su-jñānāya preṣṭha.* According to the *Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad* (3.2.3):

*nāyam ātmā pravacanena labhyo *
 *na medhayā na bahunā śrutena  
yam evaiṣa vṛṇute tena labhyas *
 *tasyaiṣa ātmā vivṛṇute tanūṁ svām*

And according to the *Brahma-sūtra* (2.1.11), *tarkāpratiṣṭhānāt.*

All Vedic literatures declare that transcendental subjects cannot be understood simply by argument or logic. Spiritual matters are far above experimental knowledge. Only by Kṛṣṇa’s mercy can one who is interested in His transcendental loving affairs understand them. If one tries to understand these transcendental topics simply by using one’s material brain substance, the attempt will be futile. Whether one is a *prākṛta-sahajiyā* or a mundane opportunist or scholar, one’s labor to understand these topics by mundane means will ultimately be frustrated. One therefore has to give up all mundane attempts and try to become a pure devotee of Lord Viṣṇu. When a devotee follows the regulative principles, the truth of these talks will be revealed to him. This is confirmed in the *Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu* (1.2.234):

*ataḥ śrī-kṛṣṇa-nāmādi* *na bhaved grāhyam indriyaiḥ  
sevonmukhe hi jihvādau* *svayam eva sphuraty adaḥ*

One cannot understand the Lord’s holy name, pastimes, form, qualities or entourage with one’s blunt material senses. However, when the senses are purified by the constant rendering of service, the spiritual truth of the pastimes of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa is revealed. As confirmed in the *Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad, yam evaiṣa vṛṇute tena labhyas.* Only one who is favored by the Supreme Personality of Godhead can understand the transcendental features of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

### Translation

**I have tried to preach the pastimes of Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s meeting with Rāmānanda Rāya in accordance with the notebooks of Śrī Svarūpa Dāmodara.**

### Purport

At the end of every chapter, the author admits the value of the disciplic succession. He never claims to have written this transcendental literature by carrying out research work. He simply admits his indebtedness to the notes taken by Svarūpa Dāmodara, Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī and other authoritative persons. This is the way of writing transcendental literatures, which are never meant for so-called scholars and research workers. The process is *mahā-jano yena gataḥ sa panthāḥ:* one has to strictly follow great personalities and *ācāryas. Ācārya-vān puruṣo veda:* one who has the favor of the *ācārya* knows everything. This statement made by Kavirāja Gosvāmī is very valuable for all pure devotees. Sometimes the *prākṛtā sahajiyās* claim that they have heard the truth from their *guru.* But one cannot have transcendental knowledge simply by hearing from a *guru* who is not bona fide. The *guru* must be bona fide, and he must have heard from his own bona fide *guru.* Only then will his message be accepted as bona fide. Lord Kṛṣṇa confirms this in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (4.1):

*śrī-bhagavān uvāca  
imaṁ vivasvate yogaṁ* *proktavān aham avyayam  
vivasvān manave prāha* *manur ikṣvākave ’bravīt*

“The Supreme Lord said, ‘I instructed this imperishable science of *yoga* to the sun-god, Vivasvān, and Vivasvān instructed it to Manu, the father of mankind, and Manu in turn instructed it to Ikṣvāku.’ ”

In this way the message is transmitted in the bona fide spiritual disciplic succession from bona fide spiritual master to bona fide student. Śrīla Kavirāja Gosvāmī therefore as usual concludes this chapter by reasserting his faith in the lotus feet of the six Gosvāmīs. Thus he is able to set forth this transcendental literature, *Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta.*
