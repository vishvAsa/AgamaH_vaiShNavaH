CHAPTER SEVENTEEN

The following summary of the seventeenth chapter is given by Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura in his *Amṛta-pravāha-bhāṣya.* After attending the Ratha-yātrā ceremony of Śrī Jagannātha, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu decided to start for Vṛndāvana. Śrī Rāmānanda Rāya and Svarūpa Dāmodara Gosvāmī selected a *brāhmaṇa* named Balabhadra Bhaṭṭācārya to personally assist Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Early in the morning before sunrise, the Lord started for the town of Kaṭaka (Cuttack). North of Kaṭaka, He penetrated a dense forest and came upon many tigers and elephants, whom He engaged in chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra.* Whenever the Lord had a chance to visit a village, Balabhadra Bhaṭṭācārya would beg alms and acquire some rice and vegetables. If there were no village, Balabhadra would cook whatever rice remained and collect some spinach from the forest for the Lord to eat. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was very pleased with the behavior of Balabhadra Bhaṭṭācārya.

In this way the Lord passed through the jungle of Jhārikhaṇḍa (Jharkhand) and finally reached Vārāṇasī. After taking His bath at the Maṇikarṇikā-ghāṭa at Vārāṇasī, He met Tapana Miśra, who took the Lord to his place and respectfully gave Him a comfortable residence. At Vārāṇasī, Vaidya Candraśekhara, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s old friend, also rendered service unto Him. Seeing the behavior of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, a Maharashtriyan *brāhmaṇa* informed Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī, the leader of the Māyāvādī *sannyāsīs.* Prakāśānanda made various accusations against the Lord. The Maharashtriyan *brāhmaṇa* was very sorry about this, and he brought the news to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, inquiring from Him why the Māyāvādī *sannyāsīs* did not utter the holy name of Kṛṣṇa. In reply, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu said that they were offenders and that one should not associate with them. In this way the Lord bestowed His blessings upon the *brāhmaṇa.*

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu next passed through Prayāga and Mathurā and then took His lunch at the home of a Sānoḍiyā *brāhmaṇa,* a disciple of Mādhavendra Purī. He bestowed His blessings upon the *brāhmaṇa* by accepting lunch at his place. Thereafter the Lord visited the twelve forests of Vṛndāvana and was filled with great ecstatic love. As He toured the Vṛndāvana forests, He heard the chirping of parrots and other birds.

ऐछे यवे पाइ, तवे लइ ‘एक’ जन ॥ १४ ॥

### Verse text

*nūtana saṅgī ha-ibeka, — snigdha yāṅra mana  
aiche yabe pāi, tabe la-i ‘eka’ jana*

### Synonyms

### Translation

**“Such a person must be a new man, and he must have a peaceful mind. If I can obtain such a man, I shall agree to take him with Me.”**

### Purport

Formerly, when Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu went to South India, a *brāhmaṇa* named Kālā Kṛṣṇadāsa went with Him. Kālā Kṛṣṇadāsa fell victim to a woman, and Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu had to take the trouble to free him from the clutches of the gypsies. Therefore the Lord here says that He wants a new man who is peaceful in mind. One whose mind is not peaceful is agitated by certain drives, especially sex desire, even though he be in the company of Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Such a man will become a victim of women and will fall down even in the company of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. *Māyā* is so strong that unless one is determined not to fall victim, even the Supreme Personality of Godhead cannot give protection. The Supreme Lord and His representative always want to give protection, but a person must take advantage of their personal contact. If one thinks that the Supreme Personality of Godhead or His representative is an ordinary man, he will certainly fall down. Thus Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu did not want a person like Kālā Kṛṣṇadāsa to accompany Him. He wanted someone who was determined, who had a peaceful mind, and who was not agitated by ulterior motives.

स्वरूप कहे, — एइ वलभद्र-भट्टाचार्य ।

### Verse text

*svarūpa kahe, — ei balabhadra-bhaṭṭācārya  
tomāte su-snigdha baḍa, paṇḍita, sādhu, ārya*

### Translation

**Svarūpa Dāmodara then said, “Here is Balabhadra Bhaṭṭācārya, who has great love for You. He is an honest, learned scholar, and he is advanced in spiritual consciousness.**

### Purport

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu wanted a new man, not a person like Kālā Kṛṣṇadāsa who would fall for women. Svarūpa Dāmodara therefore immediately pointed out a new *brāhmaṇa* named Balabhadra Bhaṭṭācārya. Śrī Svarūpa Dāmodara Gosvāmī had studied this person very thoroughly and had seen that he had great love for Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Not only did he love the Lord, but he was also learned and honest. He was not duplicitous, and he was advanced in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. According to a Bengali proverb, *ati bhakti corera lakṣaṇa:* “Too much devotion is a symptom of a thief.” A person who assumes himself to be a great devotee but mentally is thinking of something else is duplicitous. One who is not duplicitous is called *sādhu.* Svarūpa Dāmodara immediately pointed out that Balabhadra Bhaṭṭācārya was quite fit to accompany the Lord because he was a learned scholar and was simple and had great love for Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya Mahāprabhu. He was also advanced in Kṛṣṇa consciousness; therefore he was considered appropriate for accompanying the Lord as a personal servant.

The words *snigdha* (“very peaceful”) and *su-snigdha* (“affectionate”) are used in verses fourteen and fifteen respectively, and they are also found in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (1.1.8): *brūyuḥ snigdhasya śiṣyasya guravo guhyam apy uta.* “A disciple who has actual love for his spiritual master is endowed, by the blessings of the spiritual master, with all confidential knowledge.” Śrīla Śrīdhara Svāmī has commented that the word *snigdhasya* means *prema-vataḥ.* The word *prema-vataḥ* indicates that one has great love for his spiritual master.

### Purport

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was the Supreme Personality of Godhead playing the part of a very great, advanced devotee. On the *mahā-bhāgavata* platform, the devotee makes no distinction between friends and enemies. On that platform he sees everyone as a servant of Kṛṣṇa. As stated in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (5.18):

*vidyā-vinaya-sampanne* *brāhmaṇe gavi hastini  
śuni caiva śva-pāke ca* *paṇḍitāḥ sama-darśinaḥ*

“The humble sages, by virtue of true knowledge, see with equal vision a learned and gentle *brāhmaṇa,* a cow, an elephant, a dog, and a dog-eater \[outcaste\].”

A *mahā-bhāgavata,* being learned and advanced in spiritual consciousness, sees no difference between a tiger, an elephant or a learned scholar. The test of advanced spiritual consciousness is that one becomes fearless. He envies no one, and he is always engaged in the Lord’s service. He sees every living entity as an eternal part and parcel of the Lord, rendering service according to his capacity by the will of the Supreme Lord. As Kṛṣṇa confirms in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (15.15):

*sarvasya cāhaṁ hṛdi sanniviṣṭo *
 *mattaḥ smṛtir jñānam apohanaṁ ca*

“I am seated in everyone’s heart, and from Me come remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness.”

The *mahā-bhāgavata* knows that Kṛṣṇa is in everyone’s heart. Kṛṣṇa is dictating, and the living entity is following His dictations. Kṛṣṇa is within the heart of the tiger, elephant and boar. Therefore Kṛṣṇa tells them, “Here is a *mahā-bhāgavata.* Please do not disturb him.” Why, then, should the animals be envious of such a great personality? Those who are neophytes or even a little progressed in devotional service should not try to imitate the *mahā-bhāgavata.* Rather, they should only follow in his footsteps. The word *anukara* means “imitating,” and *anusara* means “trying to follow in the footsteps.” We should not try to imitate the activities of a *mahā-bhāgavata* or Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Our best efforts should be exerted in trying to follow them according to our ability. The *mahā-bhāgavata’s* heart is completely freed from material contamination, and he can become very dear even to fierce animals like tigers and elephants. Indeed, the *mahā-bhāgavata* treats them as his very intimate friends. On this platform there is no question of envy. When the Lord was passing through the forest, He was in ecstasy, thinking the forest to be Vṛndāvana. He was simply searching for Kṛṣṇa.

Thus everyone chanted the holy name of Kṛṣṇa and Hari, and they danced, cried and smiled.**

### Purport

The transcendental potency of the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra* is herein explained. First, the holy name is vibrated by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. When someone hears from Him directly, he is purified. When another person hears from that person, he also is purified. In this way the purification process is advanced among pure devotees. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and no one can claim His potency. Nonetheless, if one is a pure devotee, hundreds and thousands of men can be purified by his vibration. This potency is within every living being, provided he chants the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra* offenselessly and without material motives. When a pure devotee chants offenselessly, another person will become a Vaiṣṇava, and from him another Vaiṣṇava will emerge. This is the *paramparā* system.

*tathāpi* — still; *tāṅra* — His; *darśana* — of seeing; *śravaṇa* — of hearing; *prabhāve* — by the potency; *sakala* — all; *deśera* — of countries; *loka* — people; *ha*-*ila* — became; *vaiṣṇave* — pure devotees of the Lord.

### Translation

**Although Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu did not manifest His natural ecstatic love, everyone became a pure devotee simply by seeing and hearing Him.**

### Purport

Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī has described Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu as *mahā-vadānya-avatāra,* the most munificent incarnation. Although Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is not physically present now, simply by chanting His holy name (*śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya prabhu-nityānanda śrī-advaita gadādhara śrīvāsādi-gaura-bhakta-vṛnda*) people throughout the world are becoming devotees. This is due to the ecstatic chanting of the holy name of the Lord. It is said that a pure devotee can see the Lord at every moment, and because of this he is empowered by the Lord. This is confirmed in the *Brahma-saṁhitā* (5.38): *premāñjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena santaḥ sadaiva hṛdayeṣu vilokayanti.* Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu appeared five hundred years ago, but it cannot be said that now the potency of the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra* is less than it was in His presence. By hearing Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu through the *paramparā* system, one can be purified. Therefore in this verse it is said, *tathāpi tāṅra darśana-śravaṇa-prabhāve.* It is not that everyone is able to see Kṛṣṇa or Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya Mahāprabhu physically, but if one hears about Him through books like *Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta* and through the *paramparā* system of pure Vaiṣṇavas, there is no difficulty in becoming a pure Vaiṣṇava, free from mundane desires and personal motivations.

### Purport

Actually a *sannyāsī* or a *brāhmaṇa* will not accept an invitation extended by a person born in a lower family. However, there are many devotees who are raised to the platform of *brāhmaṇa* by their initiation. These people are called *śūdra-mahājana.* This indicates that one who is born in a non-*brāhmaṇa* family has accepted the *brāhmaṇa* status by initiation. Such devotees extended invitations to Balabhadra Bhaṭṭācārya. A Māyāvādī *sannyāsī* will accept an invitation only from a *brāhmaṇa* family, but a Vaiṣṇava does not accept an invitation from a *brāhmaṇa* if he does not belong to the Vaiṣṇava sect. However, a Vaiṣṇava will accept an invitation from a *brāhmaṇa* or *śūdra-mahājana* if that person is an initiated Vaiṣṇava. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu Himself accepted invitations from *śūdra-mahājanas,* and this confirms the fact that anyone initiated by a Vaiṣṇava *mantra* can be accepted as a *brāhmaṇa.* One can accept an invitation from such a person.

### Purport

Kāśī is another name for Vārāṇasī (Benares). It has been a place of pilgrimage since time immemorial. Two rivers named Asiḥ and Varuṇā merge there. Maṇikarṇikā is famous because, according to the opinion of great personalities, a bejeweled earring fell there from the ear of Lord Viṣṇu. According to some, it fell from the ear of Lord Śiva. The word *maṇi* means “jewel,” and *karṇikā* means “from the ear.” According to some, Lord Viśvanātha is the great physician who cures the disease of material existence by delivering a person through the ear, which receives the vibration of the holy name of Lord Rāma. Because of this, this holy place is called Maṇikarṇikā. It is said that there is no better place than where the river Ganges flows, and the bathing ghat known as Maṇikarṇikā is especially sanctified because it is very dear to Lord Viśvanātha. In the *Kāśī-khaṇḍa* it is said:

*saṁsāri-cintāmaṇir atra yasmāt *
 *tārakaṁ saj-jana-karṇikāyām  
śivo ’bhidhatte saha-sānta-kāle *
 *tad gīyate ’sau maṇi-karṇiketi*

*mukti-lakṣmī mahā-pīṭha-* *maṇis tac-caraṇābjayoḥ  
karṇikeyaṁ tataḥ prāhur* *yāṁ janā maṇi-karṇikām*

According to this passage from the *Kāśī-khaṇḍa,* one who gives up his body at Maṇikarṇikā is liberated simply by remembering Lord Śiva’s name.

### Purport

The Bindu Mādhava temple is the oldest Viṣṇu temple in Vārāṇasī. At present this temple is known as Veṇī Mādhava, and it is situated on the banks of the Ganges. Formerly five rivers converged there, and they were named Dhūtapāpā, Kiraṇā, Sarasvatī, Gaṅgā and Yamunā. Now only the river Ganges is visible. The old temple of Bindu Mādhava, which was visited by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, was later dismantled by Aurangzeb, the great Hindu-hating emperor of the Mogul dynasty. In the place of this temple, he constructed a big *masjīd,* or mosque. Later, another temple was constructed by the side of the mosque, and this temple is still existing. In the temple of Bindu Mādhava there are Deities of four-handed Nārāyaṇa and the goddess Lakṣmī. In front of these Deities is a column of Śrī Garuḍa, and along the side are deities of Lord Rāma, Sītā, Lakṣmaṇa and Śrī Hanumānjī.

In the province of Maharashtra is a state known as Sātārā. During the time of Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura, the native prince belonged to the Vaiṣṇava cult. Being a *brāhmaṇa,* he took charge of worshiping the Deity. He was known as Śrīmanta Bālāsāheb Pantha Mahārāja. The state still bears the expenditure for temple maintenance. The first king in this dynasty to take charge of worship in the temple, two hundred years ago, was Mahārāja Jagatjīvana Rāo Sāheb.

### Purport

While at Vārāṇasī (Benares), Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu stayed at the house of Tapana Miśra. Near Tapana Miśra’s house was a bathing ghat known as Pañcanadī-ghāṭa. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu used to take His bath daily at this ghat, and He used to see the temple of Bindu Mādhava. Then He would take His lunch at Tapana Miśra’s house. Near the Bindu Mādhava temple is a big banyan tree, and it is said that after eating, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu used to rest beneath the tree. That banyan tree is still known today as Caitanya-vaṭa. Gradually, due to changes in language, the name became Yatana-vaṭa. The local people still call that place Yatana-vaṭa.

At present, beside a lane there is a tomb of Vallabhācārya, but there is no sign that Caitanya Mahāprabhu ever lived there. Vallabhācārya was also known as Mahāprabhu among his disciples. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu probably lived at Yatana-vaṭa, but there is no sign of Candraśekhara’s or Tapana Miśra’s house, nor is there any sign of the Māyāvādī *sannyāsī* Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī, with whom Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu discussed the *Vedānta-sūtra.* A little distance from Yatana-vaṭa is a temple of Gaura-Nityānanda established by Śaśibhūṣaṇa Niyogī Mahāśaya of Calcutta. During the time of Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī, this temple was managed by the mother-in-law of Śaśibhūṣaṇa and his brother-in-law Nārāyaṇa-candra Ghoṣa.

### Translation

**“Due to my past deeds, I am residing at Vārāṇasī, but here I do not hear anything but the words ‘māyā’ and ‘Brahman.’ ”**

### Purport

The word *prārabdhe* (“past deeds”) is important in this verse. Since Candraśekhara was a devotee, he was always eager to hear about Kṛṣṇa and His transcendental pastimes. Most of the inhabitants of Benares were and are impersonalists, worshipers of Lord Śiva and followers of the *pañcopāsanā* method. The impersonalists imagine some form of the impersonal Brahman, and to facilitate meditation they concentrate upon the forms of Viṣṇu, Śiva, Gaṇeśa, Sūrya and goddess Durgā. Actually these *pañcopāsakas* are not devotees of anyone. As it is said, to be a servant of everyone is to be a servant of no one. Vārāṇasī, or Kāśī, is the chief holy place of pilgrimage for impersonalists, and it is not at all suitable for devotees. A Vaiṣṇava likes to live in a *viṣṇu-tīrtha,* a place where Lord Viṣṇu’s temples are present. In Vārāṇasī there are many hundreds and thousands of Lord Śiva’s temples, or *pañcopāsaka* temples. Consequently Candraśekhara expressed great unhappiness as he informed Lord Caitanya that he was obliged to live at Benares due to his past misdeeds. As said in the *Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu, durjāty-ārambhakaṁ pāpaṁ yat syāt prārabdham eva tat:* “According to one’s past misdeeds, one takes birth on a lower platform.” But in the *Brahma-saṁhitā* (5.54) it is said, *karmāṇi nirdahati kintu ca bhakti-bhājām:* “There is no *karma* attached to the past deeds or misdeeds of one in devotional service.” A devotee is not subjected to *karma-phala,* the effect of fruitive activity. *Karma-phala* is applicable to *karmīs,* not *bhaktas.*

There are three kinds of devotees: those who are eternally on the transcendental platform (*nitya-siddha*), those who have been elevated to the transcendental platform by the execution of devotional service (*sādhana-siddha*), and those who are neophytes advancing toward the perfectional platform (*sādhaka*)*.* The *sādhakas* are gradually becoming free from fruitive reaction. The *Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu* (1.1.17) describes the symptoms of *bhakti-yoga* thus:

*kleśa-ghnī śubha-dā mokṣa-* *laghutā-kṛt su-durlabhā  
sāndrānanda-viśeṣātmā* *śrī-kṛṣṇākarṣiṇī ca sā*

Devotional service is *kleśa-ghnī* even for beginners. This means that it reduces or nullifies all kinds of suffering. The word *śubha-dā* indicates that devotional service bestows all good fortune, and the word *kṛṣṇa-ākarṣiṇī* indicates that devotional service gradually attracts Kṛṣṇa toward the devotee. Consequently a devotee is not subject to any sinful reaction. In the *Bhagavad-gītā* (18.66) Kṛṣṇa says:

*sarva-dharmān parityajya* *mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja  
ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo* *mokṣayiṣyāmi mā śucaḥ*

“Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. I shall deliver you from all sinful reactions. Do not fear.”

Thus a fully surrendered, sincere devotee immediately receives relief from all kinds of sinful reactions. There are three stages of fructification for sinful activity. At one stage, one commits the sinful act, before that the seed of this act exists, and before that there is ignorance whereby one commits the sin. Suffering is involved in all three stages. However, Kṛṣṇa is merciful to His devotee, and consequently He immediately nullifies all three stages — the sin, the seed of sin and the ignorance that leads one to sin. The *Padma Purāṇa* confirms this:

*aprārabdha-phalaṁ pāpaṁ* *kūṭaṁ bījaṁ phalonmukham  
krameṇaiva pralīyeta* *viṣṇu-bhakti-ratātmanām*

For a further explanation of this topic, *The Nectar of Devotion* should be consulted.

### Translation

**Candraśekhara continued, “There is no talk at Vārāṇasī other than discussions on the six philosophical theses. Nonetheless, Tapana Miśra has been very kind to me, for he speaks about topics relating to Lord Kṛṣṇa.**

### Purport

The six philosophical theses are (1) Vaiśeṣika, propounded by Kaṇāda Ṛṣi, (2) Nyāya, propounded by Gautama Ṛṣi, (3) Yoga, or mysticism, propounded by Patañjali Ṛṣi, (4) the philosophy of Sāṅkhya, propounded by Kapila Ṛṣi, (5) the philosophy of Karma-mīmāṁsā, propounded by Jaimini Ṛṣi, and (6) the philosophy of Brahma-mīmāṁsā, or Vedānta, the ultimate conclusion of the Absolute Truth (*janmādy asya yataḥ*), propounded by Vedavyāsa. Actually Vedānta philosophy is meant for the devotees because in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (15.15) Lord Kṛṣṇa says, *vedānta-kṛd veda-vid eva cāham:* “I am the compiler of Vedānta, and I am the knower of the *Vedas.*” Vyāsadeva is an incarnation of Kṛṣṇa, and consequently Kṛṣṇa is the compiler of Vedānta philosophy. Therefore Kṛṣṇa clearly knows the purport of Vedānta philosophy. As stated in the *Bhagavad-gītā,* whoever hears Vedānta philosophy from Kṛṣṇa is actually aware of the real meaning of Vedānta. The Māyāvādīs call themselves Vedāntists but do not at all understand the purport of Vedānta philosophy. Not being properly educated, people in general think that Vedānta means the Śaṅkarite interpretation.

This principle must be followed by the *sannyāsīs* of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. That is the instruction of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, given by His personal behavior.

### Translation

**There was a great Māyāvādī sannyāsī named Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī, who used to teach Vedānta philosophy to a great assembly of followers.**

### Purport

Śrīpāda Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī was a Māyāvādī *sannyāsī,* and his characteristics have been described in *Caitanya-bhāgavata* (*Madhya-khaṇḍa,* chapter three):

*‘hasta’, ‘pada’, ‘mukha’ mora nāhika ‘locana’  
veda more ei-mata kare viḍambana*

*kāśīte paḍāya veṭā ‘prakāśa-ānanda’  
sei veṭā kare mora aṅga khaṇḍa-khaṇḍa*

*vākhānaye veda, mora vigraha nā māne  
sarvāṅge ha-ila kuṣṭha, tabu nāhi jāne*

*sarva-yajñamaya mora ye-aṅga — pavitra  
‘aja’, ‘bhava’ ādi gāya yāṅhāra caritra*

*‘puṇya’ pavitratā pāya ye-aṅga-paraśe  
tāhā ‘mithyā’ bale veṭā kemana sāhase*

In the *Madhya-khaṇḍa,* chapter twenty, it is said:

*sannyāsī ‘prakāśānanda’ vasaye kāśīte  
more khaṇḍa-khaṇḍa veṭā kare bhāla-mate*

*paḍāya ‘vedānta’, mora ‘vigraha’ nā māne  
kuṣṭha karāiluṅ aṅge, tabu nāhi jāne*

*‘satya’ mora ‘līlā-karma’, ‘satya’ mora ‘sthāna’  
ihā ‘mithyā’ bale, more kare khān-khān*

Being an impersonalist, Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī used to explain the Absolute Truth as being without hands, legs, mouths or eyes. In this way he used to cheat the people by denying the personal form of the Lord. Such a foolish person was Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī, whose only business was to sever the limbs of the Lord by proving the Lord impersonal. Although the Lord has form, Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī attempted to cut off the hands and legs of the Lord. This is the business of demons. The *Vedas* state that people who do not accept the Lord’s form are rascals. The form of the Lord is factual, for Kṛṣṇa states in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (15.15), *vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyaḥ.* When Kṛṣṇa says *aham,* He says “I am,” which means “I,” the person. He adds the word *eva,* which is used for conclusive verification. Thus by studying Vedānta philosophy one must come to know the Supreme Person. Whoever describes Vedic knowledge as impersonal is a demon. One becomes successful in life by worshiping the form of the Lord. The Māyāvādī *sannyāsīs* deny the form of the Lord, which delivers all fallen souls. Indeed, the Māyāvādī demons try to cut this form to pieces.

The Personality of Godhead is worshiped by exalted demigods like Lord Brahmā and Lord Śiva. The original Māyāvādī *sannyāsī,* Śaṅkarācārya, also accepted the fact that the Lord’s form is transcendental: *nārāyaṇaḥ paro ’vyaktāt.* “Nārāyaṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is beyond the *avyakta,* the unmanifested material energy.” *Avyaktād aṇḍa-sambhavaḥ:* “This material world is a creation of that unmanifested material energy.” However, Nārāyaṇa has His own eternal form, which is not created by the material energy. Simply by worshiping the form of the Lord, one is purified. However, Māyāvādī *sannyāsīs* are impersonalist philosophers, and they describe the form of the Lord as *māyā,* or false. How can one be purified by worshiping something false? Māyāvādī philosophers have no sufficient reason for being impersonalists. They blindly follow a principle that cannot be supported by reason or argument. This was the situation with Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī, the chief Māyāvādī *sannyāsī* of Benares. He was supposed to teach Vedānta philosophy, but he would not accept the form of the Lord; therefore he was attacked with leprosy. Nonetheless, he continued to commit sins by describing the Absolute Truth as impersonal. The Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, always displays pastimes and activities, but Māyāvādī *sannyāsīs* claim that these activities are false.

Some people falsely claim that Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī later became known as Prabodhānanda Sarasvatī, but this is not a fact. Prabodhānanda Sarasvatī was the uncle and spiritual master of Gopāla Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmī. In his *gṛhastha* life, Prabodhānanda Sarasvatī was a resident of Śrī Raṅga-kṣetra, and he belonged to the Vaiṣṇava Rāmānuja-sampradāya. It is a mistake to consider Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī and Prabodhānanda Sarasvatī the same man.

### Translation

**Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī said, “Yes, I have heard about Him. He is a sannyāsī from Bengal, and He is very sentimental. I have also heard that He belongs to the Bhāratī-sampradāya, for He is a disciple of Keśava Bhāratī. However, He is only a pretender.”**

### Purport

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was considered *bhāvuka* (sentimental) because He was always seen in the *bhāva* stage. That is, He always exhibited ecstatic love for Kṛṣṇa. However, foolish people considered Him sentimental. In the material world, so-called devotees sometimes exhibit emotional symptoms. Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s ecstatic love cannot be compared to the imitative emotional exhibitions of pretenders. Such exhibitions do not continue for very long. They are temporary. We actually see that some emotional imitators exhibit certain symptoms, but immediately after their exhibition, they are attracted to smoking and other things. In the beginning, when Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī heard of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s activities, he considered them to be those of a pretender. Consequently he called Him a *loka-pratāraka,* a pretender. Māyāvādīs cannot understand the transcendental symptoms exhibited by a devotee; therefore when such symptoms are manifest, the Māyāvādīs equate them with temporary emotional feelings. However, Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī’s statement is offensive, and consequently he should be considered an atheist (*pāṣaṇḍī*)*.* According to Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī, since Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī was not engaged in the Lord’s devotional service, his *sannyāsa* is to be considered *phalgu-vairāgya.* This means that since he did not know how to use things for the Lord’s service, his renunciation of the world was artificial.

### Purport

Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī vilified and blasphemed Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Words like *brahma, caitanya, ātmā, paramātmā, jagadīśa, īśvara, virāṭ, vibhu, bhūmā, viśvarūpa* and *vyāpaka* all indirectly indicate Kṛṣṇa. However, the chanter of these names is not actually attracted to the Supreme Personality of Godhead Kṛṣṇa and His transcendental pastimes. One may get a little light from these names, but one cannot understand that the holy name of the Lord is identical with the Lord. One considers the Lord’s names material due to a poor fund of knowledge. Māyāvādī philosophers and the *pañcopāsakas* cannot in the least understand the existence of the spiritual world and the blissful variegatedness there. They cannot understand the Absolute Truth and its spiritual varieties — name, form, qualities and pastimes. Consequently they conclude that Kṛṣṇa’s transcendental activities are *māyā.* To avoid this misconception one has to directly cultivate knowledge about the holy name of the Lord. Māyāvādī philosophers do not know this fact, and therefore they commit great offenses. One should not hear anything about Kṛṣṇa or devotional service from the mouths of Māyāvādī impersonalists.

### Purport

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is herein pointing out to the *brāhmaṇa* that Māyāvādī philosophers cannot understand that the living entity is equal in quality with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Because they do not accept this, they think that the living entity has been falsely divided from the original Brahman due to being conditioned by *māyā.* Māyāvādīs believe that the Absolute Truth is ultimately impersonal. When an incarnation of God or God Himself comes, they think He is covered by *māyā.* In other words, Māyāvādī impersonalists think that the Lord’s form is also a product of this material world. Due to a poor fund of knowledge, they cannot understand that Kṛṣṇa has no body separate from Himself. His body and Himself are both the same Absolute Truth. Not having perfect knowledge of Kṛṣṇa, such impersonalists certainly commit offenses at His lotus feet. Therefore they do not utter “Kṛṣṇa, ” the original name of the Absolute Truth. In their impersonal way, they utter the name of impersonal Brahman, spirit soul. In other words, they indulge in indirect indications of the Absolute Truth. Even if they happen to utter the names “Govinda,” “Kṛṣṇa” or “Mādhava,” they still cannot understand that these names are as good as Govinda, Kṛṣṇa or Mādhava the person. Because they are ultimately impersonalists, their uttering of the personal name has no potency. Actually they do not believe in Kṛṣṇa but consider all these names to be material vibrations. Not being able to appreciate the holy name of the Lord, they simply utter indirect names like Brahman, *ātmā* and *caitanya.*

It is a fact, however, that the name of Kṛṣṇa and Kṛṣṇa the person are both spiritual. Everything about Kṛṣṇa is transcendental, blissful and objective. For a conditioned soul, the body is different from the soul, and the name given by the father is also different from the soul. The conditioned living entity’s identification with material objects keeps him from attaining his actual position. Although he is an eternal servant of Kṛṣṇa, he acts differently. The *svarūpa,* or actual identification of the living entity, is described by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu as *jīvera ‘svarūpa’ haya — kṛṣṇera ‘nitya-dāsa’.* The conditioned soul has forgotten the real activities of his original position. However, this is not the case with Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa’s name and His person are identical. There is no such thing as *māyā* Kṛṣṇa because Kṛṣṇa is not a product of the material creation. There is no difference between Kṛṣṇa’s body and His soul. Kṛṣṇa is simultaneously both soul and body. The distinction between body and soul applies to conditioned souls. The body of the conditioned soul is different from the soul, and the conditioned soul’s name is different from his body. One may be named Mr. John, but if we call for Mr. John, Mr. John may never actually appear. However, if we utter the holy name of Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa is immediately present on our tongue. In the *Padma Purāṇa,* Kṛṣṇa says, *mad-bhaktā yatra gāyanti tatra tiṣṭhāmi nārada:* “O Nārada, I am present wherever My devotees are chanting.” When the devotees chant the holy name of Kṛṣṇa — Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare — Lord Kṛṣṇa is immediately present.

Kṛṣṇa’s name is complete, and it is the form of all transcendental mellows. It is not a material name under any condition, and it is no less powerful than Kṛṣṇa Himself. Since Kṛṣṇa’s name is not contaminated by the material qualities, there is no question of its being involved with māyā. Kṛṣṇa’s name is always liberated and spiritual; it is never conditioned by the laws of material nature. This is because the name of Kṛṣṇa and Kṛṣṇa Himself are identical.’**

Since Kṛṣṇa’s transcendental body, name, form, qualities, pastimes and entourage are all the Absolute Truth, they are as good as Kṛṣṇa Himself (*sac-cid-ānanda-vigraha*)*.* As long as the living entity is conditioned by the three modes of material nature (goodness, passion and ignorance), the objects of his material senses — material form, taste, smell, sound and touch — will not help him understand spiritual knowledge and bliss. Rather, these are revealed to the pure devotee. One’s material name, form and qualities are certainly different from one another. In the material world, there is no conception of absolute; however, when we come to Kṛṣṇa consciousness we find that there is no material difference between Kṛṣṇa’s body and His names, activities and entourage.

### Purport

When one understands that he belongs not to the material world but to the spiritual world, one is called liberated. Being situated in the spiritual world is certainly pleasurable, but those who realize the transcendental name, form, qualities and pastimes of Lord Kṛṣṇa enjoy transcendental bliss many times more than one who has simply realized the self. When one is situated on the platform of self-realization, he can certainly be easily attracted by Kṛṣṇa and become a servant of the Lord. This is explained in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (18.54):

*brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā* *na śocati na kāṅkṣati  
samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu* *mad-bhaktiṁ labhate parām*

“One who is thus transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman and becomes fully joyful. He never laments or desires to have anything. He is equally disposed to every living entity. In that state he attains pure devotional service unto Me.”

When one becomes spiritually realized (*brahma-bhūta*), he becomes happy (*prasannātmā*), for he is relieved from material conceptions. One who has attained this platform is not agitated by material action and reaction. He sees everyone on the platform of spirit soul (*paṇḍitāḥ sama-darśinaḥ*)*.* When one is completely realized, he can rise to the platform of pure devotional service (*mad-bhaktiṁ labhate parām*)*.* When one comes to the platform of *bhakti,* devotional service, he automatically realizes who Kṛṣṇa is. As the Lord says in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (18.55):

*bhaktyā mām abhijānāti* *yāvān yaś cāsmi tattvataḥ  
tato māṁ tattvato jñātvā* *viśate tad-anantaram*

“One can understand Me as I am, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, only by devotional service. And when one is in full consciousness of Me by such devotion, he can enter into the kingdom of God.”

It is only on the *bhakti* platform that one can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead Kṛṣṇa and His transcendental name, form, qualities, pastimes and entourage. Being thus qualified spiritually, one is allowed to enter the spiritual kingdom of God and return home, back to Godhead (*viśate tad-anantaram*).

### Purport

This is a verse from *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (3.15.43). Vidura and Maitreya discussed the pregnancy of Diti. Diti’s pregnancy caused the demigods to be very much afraid, and the demigods went to see Lord Brahmā. Lord Brahmā explained the original incident involving the cursing of Jaya and Vijaya by the Catuḥsana Kumāras. Once the Catuḥsana Kumāras went to Vaikuṇṭha to visit Nārāyaṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but they were stopped from entering the palace at the seventh gate by two doorkeepers named Jaya and Vijaya. Due to their jealousy, Jaya and Vijaya would not allow the Kumāras entry, and consequently the Kumāras became angry and cursed Jaya and Vijaya, condemning them to take birth in a family of *asuras* in the material world. The omniscient Personality of Godhead could immediately understand the incident, and He came with His eternal consort, the goddess of fortune. The Catuḥsana Kumāras immediately offered their obeisances unto the Lord. Simply by seeing the Lord and smelling the aroma of *tulasī* and saffron from His lotus feet, the Kumāras became devotees and abandoned their long-cherished impersonalism. Thus the four Kumāras were turned into Vaiṣṇavas simply by smelling the aromatic *tulasī* mixed with saffron. Those who are actually on the platform of Brahman realization and who have not offended the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa can immediately become Vaiṣṇavas simply by smelling the aroma of the Lord’s lotus feet. But those who are offenders or demons are never attracted to the Lord’s personal feature, even though they may visit the Lord’s temple many times. In Vṛndāvana we have seen many Māyāvādī *sannyāsīs* who do not even come to the temple of Govindajī, Gopīnātha or Madana-mohana because they think that such temples are *māyā.* Therefore they are called Māyāvādīs. Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya Mahāprabhu therefore said that the Māyāvādīs are the greatest offenders.

अतएव ‘कृष्णनाम’ ना आइसे तार मुखे ।

### Verse text

*ataeva ‘kṛṣṇa-nāma’ nā āise tāra mukhe  
māyāvādi-gaṇa yāte mahā bahirmukhe*

### Synonyms

*ataeva* — therefore; *kṛṣṇa*-*nāma* — the holy name of Kṛṣṇa; *nā* — does not; *āise* — come; *tāra* *mukhe* — in their mouths; *māyāvādi*-*gaṇa* — all the Māyāvādīs; *yāte* — because; *mahā* *bahiḥ*-*mukhe* — great offenders by dint of strong atheism.

### Translation

**“Because the Māyāvādīs are great offenders and atheistic philosophers, the holy name of Kṛṣṇa does not come from their mouths.**

### Purport

Because they are constantly blaspheming the Supreme Personality of Godhead by saying that He has no head, hands or legs, Māyāvādī philosophers remain offenders for many, many births, even though they have partially realized Brahman. However, if such impersonalists are not offenders at the lotus feet of the Lord, they immediately become devotees in the association of a devotee. In other words, if an impersonalist is not an offender, he can become a devotee if he gets a chance to associate with other devotees. If he is an offender, he cannot be converted even by the association of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya Mahāprabhu was very much afraid of this Māyāvādī offender; therefore He spoke as follows.

### Translation

**“I have brought a heavy load to sell in this city. To take it back again is a very difficult job; therefore if I get but a fraction of the price, I shall sell it here in this city of Kāśī.”**

### Purport

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was selling the transcendental holy name of the Lord. But Kāśī was a city of Māyāvādīs (impersonalists), and such people will never chant the holy names of the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra.* Consequently Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was feeling disappointed. How could He teach the Māyāvādīs the importance of chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra*? The attraction for chanting the holy name of the Lord belongs absolutely to pure devotees, and there was no possibility of finding pure devotees at Kāśī. Consequently Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s commodity was certainly very heavy. The Lord therefore suggested that even though there were no pure devotees in Kāśī, if someone was a little inclined to chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra,* He would deliver this big load, although the proper price was not paid.

Actually we experienced this when we came to preach the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement in the West. When we came to New York in 1965, we never expected that the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra* would be accepted in this country. Nonetheless, we invited people to our storefront to join in chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra,* and the Lord’s holy name is so attractive that simply by coming to our storefront in New York, fortunate young people became Kṛṣṇa conscious. Although this mission was started with insignificant capital, it is now going nicely. The spreading of the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra* in the West has become successful because the young people were not offenders. The youths who joined this movement were not very advanced as far as purity is concerned, nor were they very well educated in Vedic knowledge, but because they were not offenders, they could accept the importance of the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement. We are now very happy to see that this movement is advancing more and more in the Western countries. We therefore conclude that the so-called *mlecchas* and *yavanas* of the Western countries are more purified than offensive Māyāvādīs or atheistic impersonalists.

The city of Prayāga is situated a few miles from the city of Allahabad. The name Prayāga is given due to successful sacrifices performed there. It is said, *prakṛṣṭo yāgo yāga-phalaṁ yasmāt.* If one performs sacrifices at Prayāga, he certainly gets immediate results without difficulty. Prayāga is also called Tīrtharāja, the king of all places of pilgrimage. This holy place is situated on the confluence of the rivers Ganges and Yamunā. Every year a fair takes place there known as Māgha-melā, and every twelve years a Kumbha-melā is also held. In any case, many people come to bathe there every year. During Māgha-melā, people from the local district generally come, and during Kumbha-melā people come from all over India to live there and bathe in the Ganges and Yamunā. Whoever goes there immediately feels the place’s spiritual influence. A fort located there was constructed by the emperor Akbar about five hundred years ago, and near the fort is a place called Triveṇī. On the other side of Prayāga is an old place known as Pratiṣṭhāna-pura. It is also well known as Jhuṅsi. Many saintly people live there, and consequently it is very attractive from the spiritual point of view.

### Purport

At the present moment, the temple of Keśavajī is very much improved. At one time, Keśavajī-mandira was attacked by the emperor Aurangzeb, who constructed such a big mosque there that the temple of Keśavajī was insignificant in comparison. But with the help of many rich Marwaris, the temple has been improved, and a very large temple is now being constructed so that the mosque is now appearing diminished in comparison. Many archeological discoveries have been made there, and many people from foreign countries are beginning to appreciate Kṛṣṇa’s birthplace. This Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is attracting many foreigners to the Keśavajī temple, and now they will also be attracted by the Kṛṣṇa-Balarāma temple in Vṛndāvana.

### Purport

In northwestern India, *vaiśyas* are divided into various subdivisions. Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura points out that they are divided as Āgarwālā, Kālawāra and Sānwāḍa. Out of them, the Āgarwālās are said to be first-class *vaiśyas,* and the Kālawāras and Sānwāḍas are considered lower due to their occupational degradation. The Kālawāras generally take wine and other intoxicants. Although they are *vaiśyas,* they are considered to belong to a lower class. The priests who guide the Kālawāras and the Sānwāḍas are called Sanoḍiyā *brāhmaṇas.* Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura states that the word *sānoyāḍa* in Bengal indicates *suvarṇa-vaṇik.* In Bengal there are priests who guide the *suvarṇa-vaṇik* community, which is also considered a low class. There is little difference between the Sānwāḍas and the *suvarṇa-vaṇiks.* Generally the *suvarṇa-vaṇiks* are bankers dealing in gold and silver. In western India, the Āgarwālās also belong to the banking profession. This is the original business of the *suvarṇa-vaṇik* or Āgarwālā community. Historically, the Āgarwālās came from the up-country named Ayodha, and the *suvarṇa-vaṇik* community also came from Ayodha. It therefore appears that the *suvarṇa-vaṇiks* and the Āgarwālās belong to the same community. The Sanoḍiyā *brāhmaṇas* were the guides of the Kālawāras and Sānwāḍas. They are therefore considered to be lower-class *brāhmaṇas,* and a *sannyāsī* is not allowed to take alms or food from them. However, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu accepted lunch cooked by a Sanoḍiyā *brāhmaṇa* simply because he belonged to Mādhavendra Purī’s community. Śrīla Mādhavendra Purī was the spiritual master of Īśvara Purī, who was the spiritual master of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Thus a spiritual relationship is established on the spiritual platform, without consideration of material inferiority or superiority.

Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura remarks that although the *brāhmaṇa* did not belong to a superior community, he fearlessly chastised so-called caste *brāhmaṇas* because he was situated on the platform of pure devotional service. There are people who are opposed to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s accepting a Vaiṣṇava belonging to a lower caste. Such people do not consider *mahā-prasādam* transcendental, and therefore they are described here as *mūrkha* (foolish) and *duṣṭa* (mischievous). A pure devotee has the power to challenge such high-caste people, and his brave statements are not to be considered proud or puffed up. On the contrary, he is to be considered straightforward. Such a person does not like to flatter high-class *brāhmaṇas* who belong to the non-Vaiṣṇava community.

### Translation

**Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu replied, “The Vedas, Purāṇas and great learned sages are not always in agreement with one another. Consequently there are different religious principles.**

### Purport

Unless one comes to the Absolute Truth, there is no possibility of agreement. *Nāsāv ṛṣir yasya mataṁ na bhinnam:* it is said that a great learned scholar or sage cannot be exalted unless he disagrees with other scholars and sages. On the material platform, there is no possibility of agreement; therefore there are different kinds of religious systems. But the Absolute Truth is one, and when one is situated in the Absolute Truth, there is no disagreement. On that absolute platform the Supreme Personality of Godhead is worshipable. As stated in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (18.55), *bhaktyā mām abhijānāti yāvān yaś cāsmi tattvataḥ.* On the absolute platform, the worshipful Deity is one, and the process of worship is also one. That process is *bhakti.*

There are many different religions throughout the world because they are not all on the absolute platform of devotional service. As confirmed in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (18.66): *sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja.* The word *ekam* means “one,” Kṛṣṇa. On this platform, there are no different religious systems. According to *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (1.1.2), *dharmaḥ projjhita-kaitavo ’tra.* On the material platform, religious systems are different. *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* describes them from the very beginning as *dharmaḥ kaitavaḥ,* cheating religions. None of these religions is actually genuine. The genuine religious system is that which enables one to become a lover of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the words of *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (1.2.6):

*sa vai puṁsāṁ paro dharmo* *yato bhaktir adhokṣaje  
ahaituky apratihatā* *yayātmā suprasīdati*

“The supreme occupation \[*dharma*\] for all humanity is that by which men can attain to loving devotional service unto the transcendent Lord. Such devotional service must be unmotivated and uninterrupted in order to completely satisfy the self.”

On this platform there is nothing but the service of the Lord. When a person has no ulterior motive, there is certainly oneness and agreement of principles. Since everyone has a different body and mind, different types of religions are needed. But when one is situated on the spiritual platform, there are no bodily and mental differences. Consequently on the absolute platform there is oneness in religion.

### Purport

Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura gives the following commentary on this passage. A *sādhu,* or honest man, is called a *mahājana* or a *mahātmā.* The *mahātmā* is described thus by Lord Kṛṣṇa in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (9.13):

*mahātmānas tu māṁ pārtha* *daivīṁ prakṛtim āśritāḥ  
bhajanty ananya-manaso* *jñātvā bhūtādim avyayam*

“O son of Pṛthā, those who are not deluded, the great souls, are under the protection of the divine nature. They are fully engaged in devotional service because they know Me as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, original and inexhaustible.”

In the material world, the word *mahātmā* is understood in different ways by different religionists. Mundaners also come up with their different angles of vision. For the conditioned soul busy in sense gratification, a *mahājana* is recognized according to the proportion of sense gratification he offers. For instance, a businessman may consider a certain banker to be a *mahājana,* and *karmīs* desiring material enjoyment may consider philosophers like Jaimini to be *mahājanas.* There are many *yogīs* who want to control the senses, and for them Patañjali Ṛṣi is a *mahājana.* For the *jñānīs,* the atheist Kapila, Vasiṣṭha, Durvāsā, Dattātreya and other impersonalist philosophers are *mahājanas.* For the demons, Hiraṇyākṣa, Hiraṇyakaśipu, Rāvaṇa, Rāvaṇa’s son Meghanāda, Jarāsandha and others are accepted as *mahājanas.* For materialistic anthropologists speculating on the evolution of the body, a person like Darwin is a *mahājana.* The scientists who are bewildered by Kṛṣṇa’s external energy have no relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, yet they are accepted by some as *mahājanas.* Similarly, philosophers, historians, literary men, public speakers and social and political leaders are sometimes accepted as *mahājanas.* Such *mahājanas* are respected by certain men who have been described in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (2.3.19):

*śva-viḍ-varāhoṣṭra-kharaiḥ*  
 *saṁstutaḥ puruṣaḥ paśuḥ  
na yat-karṇa-pathopeto*  
 *jātu nāma gadāgrajaḥ*

“Men who are like dogs, hogs, camels and asses praise those men who never listen to the transcendental pastimes of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the deliverer from evils.”

Thus on the material platform animalistic leaders are worshiped by animals. Sometimes physicians, psychiatrists and social workers try to mitigate bodily pain, distress and fear, but they have no knowledge of spiritual identity and are bereft of a relationship with God. Yet they are considered *mahājanas* by the illusioned. Self-deceived persons sometimes accept leaders or spiritual masters from a priestly order that has been officially appointed by the codes of material life. In this way, they are deceived by official priests. Sometimes people accept as *mahājanas* those who have been designated by Śrīla Vṛndāvana dāsa Ṭhākura as *ḍhaṅga-vipras* (imposter *brāhmaṇas*)*.* Such imposters imitate the characteristics of Śrīla Haridāsa Ṭhākura, and they envy Haridāsa Ṭhākura, who was certainly a *mahājana.* They make great artificial endeavors, advertising themselves as great devotees of the Lord or as mystic hypnotists knowledgeable in witchcraft, hypnotism and miracles. Sometimes people accept as *mahājanas* demons like Pūtanā, Tṛṇāvarta, Vatsa, Baka, Aghāsura, Dhenuka, Kālīya and Pralamba. Some people accept imitators and adversaries of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, such as Pauṇḍraka, Śṛgāla Vāsudeva, the spiritual master of the demons (Śukrācārya), or atheists like Cārvāka, King Vena, Sugata and Arhat. People who accept such imitators as *mahājanas* have no faith in Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Rather, they accept godless cheaters who present themselves as incarnations of God and cheat foolish people within the material world by word jugglery. Thus many rascals are accepted as *mahājanas.*

It is those who are devoid of devotional service who sometimes mistakenly accept persons with mundane motives as *mahājanas.* The only motive must be *kṛṣṇa-bhakti,* devotional service to the Lord. Sometimes fruitive workers, dry philosophers, nondevotees, mystic *yogīs* and persons attached to material opulence, women and money are considered *mahājanas.* But *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (6.3.25) gives the following statement about such unauthorized *mahājanas:*

*prāyeṇa veda tad idaṁ na mahājano ’yaṁ *
 *devyā vimohita-matir bata māyayālam  
trayyāṁ jaḍī-kṛta-matir madhu-puṣpitāyāṁ *
 *vaitānike mahati karmaṇi yujyamānaḥ*

In this material world, *karmīs* (fruitive actors) are accepted as *mahājanas* by foolish people who do not know the value of devotional service. The mundane intelligence and mental speculative methods of such foolish people are under the control of the three modes of material nature. Consequently they cannot understand unalloyed devotional service. They are attracted by material activities, and they become worshipers of material nature. Thus they are known as fruitive actors. They even become entangled in material activities disguised as spiritual activities. In the *Bhagavad-gītā* such people are described as *veda-vāda-ratāḥ,* supposed followers of the *Vedas.* They do not understand the real purport of the *Vedas,* yet they think of themselves as Vedic authorities. People versed in Vedic knowledge must know Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. *Vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyaḥ.* (Bg. 15.15)

In this material world a person may be famous as a *karma-vīra,* a successful fruitive worker, or he may be very successful in performing religious duties, or he may be known as a hero in mental speculation (*jñāna-vīra*), or he may be a very famous renunciant. In any case, *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (3.23.56) gives the following opinion in this matter.

*neha yat karma dharmāya* *na virāgāya kalpate  
na tīrtha-pada-sevāyai* *jīvann api mṛto hi saḥ*

“Anyone whose work is not meant for elevating him to religious life, anyone whose religious ritualistic performances do not raise him to renunciation, and anyone situated in renunciation that does not lead him to devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead must be considered dead, although he is breathing.”

The conclusion is that all pious activity, fruitive activity, religious principles and renunciation must ultimately lead to devotional service. There are different types of processes for rendering service. One may serve his country, people and society, the *varṇāśrama-dharma* system*,* the sick, the poor, the rich, women, demigods and so on. All this service comes under the heading of sense gratification, or enjoyment in the material world. It is most unfortunate that people are more or less attracted by such material activity and that the leaders of these activities are accepted as *mahājanas,* great ideal leaders. Actually they are only misleaders, but an ordinary man cannot understand how he is being misled.

Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura says, *sādhu-śāstra-guru-vākya, cittete kariyā aikya:* “One should accept as one’s guide the words of the *sādhus,* the *śāstra* and the *guru.*” A *sādhu* is a great personality like Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, the *śāstras* are the injunctions of revealed scriptures, and the *guru,* or spiritual master, is one who confirms the scriptural injunctions. Accepting the guidance of these three is the actual way of following the great personalities (*mahājanas*) for real advancement in life (*mahājano yena gataḥ sa panthāḥ*). A man covered by illusion cannot understand the proper way; therefore Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu says, *dharma-sthāpana-hetu sādhura vyavahāra:* “The behavior of a devotee is the criterion for all other behavior.” Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu Himself followed the devotional principles and taught others to follow them. *Purī-gosāñira ye ācaraṇa, sei dharma sāra.* Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu personally followed the behavior of Mādhavendra Purī and advised others to follow his principles. Unfortunately, people have been attracted to the material body since time immemorial.

*yasyātma-buddhiḥ kuṇape tri-dhātuke *
 *sva-dhīḥ kalatrādiṣu bhauma ijya-dhīḥ  
yat-tīrtha-buddhiḥ salile na karhicij *
 *janeṣv abhijñeṣu sa eva go-kharaḥ*

“A human being who identifies this body made of three elements with his self, who considers the by-products of the body to be his kinsmen, who considers his land of birth worshipable, and who goes to a place of pilgrimage simply to take a bath rather than meet men of transcendental knowledge there is to be considered like an ass or a cow.” (*Bhāg.* 10.84.13) Those who accept the logic of *gaḍḍālikā-pravāha* and follow in the footsteps of pseudo *mahājanas* are carried away by the waves of *māyā.* Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura therefore warns:

*miche māyāra vaśe,* *yāccha bhese’,  
khāccha hābuḍubu, bhāi  
jīva kṛṣṇa-dāsa,* *e viśvāsa,  
ka’rle ta’ āra duḥkha nāi*

“Don’t be carried away by the waves of *māyā.* Just surrender to the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, and all miseries will end.” Those who follow social customs and behavior forget to follow the path chalked out by the *mahājanas;* thus they are offenders at the feet of the *mahājanas.* Sometimes they consider such *mahājanas* very conservative, or they create their own *mahājanas.* In this way they ignore the principles of the *paramparā* system. This is a great misfortune for everyone. If one does not follow in the footsteps of the real *mahājanas,* one’s plans for happiness will be frustrated. This is elaborately explained later in the *Madhya-līlā* (chapter twenty-five, verses 55, 56 and 58). It is there stated:

*parama kāraṇa īśvare keha nāhi māne  
sva-sva-mata sthāpe para-matera khaṇḍane*

*tāte chaya darśana haite ‘tattva’ nāhi jāni  
‘mahājana’ yei kahe, sei ‘satya’ māni*

*śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya-vāṇī — amṛtera dhāra  
tiṅho ye kahaye vastu, sei ‘tattva’ — sāra*

People are so unfortunate that they do not accept the instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Instead, they want to be supported by so-called *mahājanas,* or authorities. *Tāte chaya darśana haite ‘tattva’ nāhi jāni:* we cannot ascertain the real truth simply by following speculators. We have to follow the footsteps of the *mahājanas* in the disciplic succession. Then our attempt will be successful. *Śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya-vāṇī — amṛtera dhāra:* “Whatever is spoken by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is an incessant flow of nectar.” Whoever accepts His words as reality can understand the essence of the Absolute Truth.

No one can ascertain the Absolute Truth by following the philosophy of Sāṅkhya or the *yoga* system of Patañjali, for neither the followers of Sāṅkhya nor the *yogīs* who follow Patañjali accept Lord Viṣṇu as the Supreme Personality of Godhead (*na te viduḥ svārtha-gatiṁ hi viṣṇum*)*.* The ambition of such people is never fulfilled; therefore they are attracted by the external energy. Although mental speculators may be renowned all over the world as great authorities, actually they are not. Such leaders are themselves conservative and not at all liberal. However, if we preach this philosophy, people will consider Vaiṣṇavas very sectarian. Śrīla Mādhavendra Purī was a real *mahājana,* but misguided people cannot distinguish the real from the unreal. But a person who is awakened to Kṛṣṇa consciousness can understand the real religious path chalked out by the Lord and His pure devotees. Śrī Mādhavendra Purī was a real *mahājana* because he understood the Absolute Truth properly and throughout his life behaved like a pure devotee. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu approved the method of Śrī Mādhavendra Purī. Therefore, although from the material viewpoint the Sanoḍiyā *brāhmaṇa* was on a lower platform, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu considered him situated on the highest platform of spiritual realization.

*Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (6.3.20) states that there are twelve *mahājanas:* Brahmā, Nārada, Śambhu, the four Kumāras, Kapila, Manu, Prahlāda, Janaka, Bhīṣma, Bali, Śukadeva and Yamarāja.

To select our *mahājanas* in the Gauḍīya-sampradāya, we have to follow in the footsteps of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and His representatives. His next representative is Śrī Svarūpa Dāmodara Gosvāmī, and the next representatives are the six Gosvāmīs — Śrī Rūpa, Śrī Sanātana, Bhaṭṭa Raghunātha, Śrī Jīva, Gopāla Bhaṭṭa and Dāsa Raghunātha. A follower of Viṣṇu Svāmī’s was Śrīdhara Svāmī, the most well known commentator on *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.* He was also a *mahājana.* Similarly, Caṇḍīdāsa, Vidyāpati and Jayadeva were all *mahājanas.* One who tries to imitate the *mahājanas* just to become an imitative spiritual master is certainly far away from following in the footsteps of the *mahājanas.* Sometimes people cannot actually understand how a *mahājana* follows other *mahājanas.* In this way people commit offenses and fall from devotional service.

### Translation

**Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu continued, “ ‘Dry arguments are inconclusive. A great personality whose opinion does not differ from others is not considered a great sage. Simply by studying the Vedas, which are variegated, one cannot come to the right path by which religious principles are understood. The solid truth of religious principles is hidden in the heart of an unadulterated, self-realized person. Consequently, as the śāstras confirm, one should accept whatever progressive path the mahājanas advocate.’ ”**

Some are located on the western side of the Yamunā, and others are on the eastern side. The forests situated on the eastern side are Bhadravana, Bilvavana, Lauhavana, Bhāṇḍīravana and Mahāvana. On the western side are Madhuvana, Tālavana, Kumudavana, Bahulāvana, Kāmyavana, Khadiravana and Vṛndāvana. These are the twelve forests of the Vṛndāvana area.
