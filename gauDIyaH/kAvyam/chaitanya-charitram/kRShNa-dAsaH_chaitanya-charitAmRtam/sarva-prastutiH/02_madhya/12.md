CHAPTER TWELVE

In his *Amṛta-pravāha-bhāṣya,* Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura summarizes this chapter as follows. The King of Orissa, Mahārāja Pratāparudra, tried his best to see Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Śrīla Nityānanda Prabhu and the other devotees informed the Lord about the King’s desire, but Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu would not agree to see him. At that time Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu devised a plan, and He sent a piece of the Lord’s outward garment to the King. The next day, when Rāmānanda Rāya again entreated Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu to see the King, the Lord, denying the request, asked Rāmānanda Rāya to bring the King’s son before Him. The prince visited the Lord dressed like a Vaiṣṇava, and this awakened remembrance of Kṛṣṇa. Thus Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu delivered the son of Mahārāja Pratāparudra.

After this, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu washed the Guṇḍicā temple before the Ratha-yātrā took place. He then took His bath at Indradyumna Lake and partook of *prasādam* in the garden nearby. While Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu washed the temple of Guṇḍicā, a Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava washed the lotus feet of the Lord and drank the water. This incident is very significant, for it awoke within the devotee ecstatic love. Then the son of Advaita Prabhu named Gopāla fainted during *kīrtana,* and when he did not come to his senses, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu favored him by awakening him. There was also some humorous talk between Nityānanda Prabhu and Advaita Prabhu during *prasādam.* Advaita Prabhu said that Nityānanda Prabhu was unknown to anyone and that it was not the duty of a householder *brāhmaṇa* to accept dinner with a person unknown in society. In answer to this humorous statement, Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu replied that Advaita Ācārya was a monist and that one could not know how his mind could be turned by eating with such an impersonalist. The conversation of these two *prabhus* — Nityānanda Prabhu and Advaita Prabhu — carried a deep meaning that only an intelligent man can understand. After all the Vaiṣṇavas finished their luncheon, Svarūpa Dāmodara and others took their *prasādam* within the room. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu took great pleasure when He saw the Jagannātha Deity after the period of the Deity’s retirement. At that time Lord Caitanya was accompanied by all the devotees, and all of them were very pleased.

### Translation

**Nityānanda Prabhu continued, “The King has decided to become a mendicant and accept the sign of a mendicant by wearing an ivory earring. He does not want to enjoy his kingdom without seeing the lotus feet of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.”**

### Purport

In India there is still a class of professional mendicants who are very much like the gypsies of Western countries. They know some magical art and mystical processes, and their business is to beg from door to door, sometimes pleading and sometimes threatening. Such mendicants are sometimes called *yogīs* and sometimes *kāṇaphāṭā yogīs.* The word *kāṇaphāṭā* refers to one who has put a hole in his ear to wear an earring made of ivory. Mahārāja Pratāparudra was so depressed by not getting to see Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu that he decided to become such a *yogī.* Ordinary men think that a *yogī* must have an ivory earring in his ear, but this is not the sign of a real *yogī.* Mahārāja Pratāparudra also thought that to become a mendicant *yogī,* one must wear such an earring.

### Translation

**Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, “I can understand that you all desire to take Me to Kaṭaka to see the King.”**

### Purport

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is naturally the reservoir of all kindness, and as soon as He heard the statement made by the King, His heart immediately softened. Thus the Lord was ready to go see the King even at Kaṭaka. He did not even consider allowing the King to come from Kaṭaka to Jagannātha Purī to see Him. It is significant that Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was so kind that He was ready to go see the King at Kaṭaka. Apparently it was never expected that the King wanted to see the Lord at His place, but by way of being externally harsh, the Lord indicated that if all the devotees so desired, He would go to Kaṭaka to see the King.

तोमा-सवार आज्ञाय़ आमि ना मिलि राजारे ।  
दामोदर कहे यवे, मिलि तवे ताँरे ॥ २५ ॥

### Verse text

*tomā-sabāra ājñāya āmi nā mili rājāre  
dāmodara kahe yabe, mili tabe tāṅre*

### Synonyms

*tomā*-*sabāra* — of all of you; *ājñāya* — by the order; *āmi* — I; *nā* — not; *mili* — shall meet; *rājāre* — the King; *dāmodara* — Dāmodara Paṇḍita; *kahe* — says; *yabe* — when; *mili* — I shall meet; *tabe* — then; *tāṅre* — him.

### Translation

**“I shall not meet the King at the request of all the devotees, but I shall do so if Dāmodara will give his permission.”**

### Purport

From the spiritual point of view, a *sannyāsī* is strictly forbidden to see materialistic people, especially a king who is always engaged in counting pounds, shillings and pence. Indeed, the meeting between a *sannyāsī* and a king is always considered abominable. A *sannyāsī* is always subjected to public criticism, and a small fault on his part is taken seriously by the public. People actually expect a *sannyāsī* to preach and not take part in any social or political matters. If a *sannyāsī* is subject to public criticism, his preaching will not be fruitful. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu specifically wanted to avoid such criticism so that His preaching work would not be hampered. It so happened that while the Lord was talking to His disciples at that time, the devotee Dāmodara Paṇḍita was present. This Dāmodara Paṇḍita was a very faithful devotee and a staunch lover of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Whenever there was anything that might touch or taint the character of the Lord, Dāmodara Paṇḍita would immediately point it out, not even considering the exalted position of the Lord. It is sometimes said that fools rush in where angels dare not, and Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu wanted to point out Dāmodara Paṇḍita’s foolishness in coming forward to criticize the Lord. This is why the Lord stated that if Dāmodara Paṇḍita would give Him permission, He would go to see the King. There was deep meaning in this statement, for it is a warning that Dāmodara should not dare criticize the Lord any more, for it was not befitting his position as a devotee. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was considered the guide and spiritual master of all the devotees living with Him. Dāmodara Paṇḍita was one of them, and the Lord rendered Dāmodara Paṇḍita a special favor by warning him to avoid criticizing Him any further. A devotee or a disciple should never attempt to criticize the Lord or His representative, the spiritual master.

### Purport

This refers to the day Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa and His cowherd boys and flocks of animals were present in the pasturing grounds near Mathurā. At that time the cowherd boys, being a little hungry, requested food, and Lord Kṛṣṇa asked them to go to the *brāhmaṇas* who were engaged nearby in performing *yajña,* or sacrifice, and to get some food from that *yajña.* Being so ordered by the Lord, all the cowherd boys went to the *brāhmaṇas* and asked them for food, but they were denied. After this, the cowherd boys begged food from the wives of the *brāhmaṇas.* All these wives were very much devoted to Lord Kṛṣṇa in spontaneous love, and as soon as they heard the request of the cowherd boys and understood that Kṛṣṇa wanted some food, they immediately left the place of sacrifice. They were very much chastised for this by their husbands, and they were ready to give up their lives. It is the nature of a pure devotee to sacrifice his life for the transcendental loving service of the Lord.

Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu was thus very tactfully suggesting that Caitanya Mahāprabhu give a piece of His old clothing to the King. Even though the King was not to meet the Lord, the King would then be pacified by receiving such a cloth. The King was very anxious to see the Lord, yet it was not possible for the Lord to see him. Just to resolve the situation, Nityānanda Prabhu suggested that the Lord send an old piece of clothing. Thus the King would understand that the Lord was showing mercy to him. The King would then not do anything drastic like giving up his life or becoming a mendicant.

### Translation

**When the King received the old cloth, he began to worship it exactly as he would worship the Lord personally.**

### Purport

This is also the conclusion of the Vedic injunctions. Since the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the Absolute Truth, everything in relation to Him is on the same platform. The King had great affection for Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and although he did not see the Lord, he had nonetheless already attained the conclusion of devotional service. Immediately upon receiving the cloth from Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya, the King began to worship it, accepting it as Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. The Lord’s clothing, bedding, slippers and everything required as an ordinary necessity are all transformations of Śeṣa, Viṣṇu, the expansion of Śrī Baladeva. Thus the cloth and other paraphernalia of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are but other forms of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Everything connected to the Lord is worshipable. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu instructs us that just as Kṛṣṇa is worshipable, Kṛṣṇa’s place, Vṛndāvana, is also worshipable. And as Vṛndāvana is worshipable, similarly the paraphernalia in Vṛndāvana — the trees, roads, river, everything — is worshipable. A pure devotee thus sings, *jaya jaya vṛndāvana-vāsī yata jana:* “All glories to the residents of Vṛndāvana!” If a devotee has a staunch devotional attitude, all these conclusions will be awakened or revealed within the heart.

*yasya deve parā bhaktir* *yathā deve tathā gurau  
tasyaite kathitā hy arthāḥ* *prakāśante mahātmanaḥ*

“Only unto those great souls who have implicit faith in both the Lord and the spiritual master are all the imports of Vedic knowledge automatically revealed.” (*Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad* 6.23)

Thus following in the footsteps of Mahārāja Pratāparudra and other devotees, we should learn to worship everything belonging to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is referred to by Lord Śiva as *tadīyānām.* In the *Padma Purāṇa* it is said:

*ārādhanānāṁ sarveṣāṁ* *viṣṇor ārādhanaṁ param  
tasmāt parataraṁ devi* *tadīyānāṁ samarcanam*

“O Devī, the most exalted system of worship is the worship of Lord Viṣṇu. Greater than that is the worship of *tadīya,* or anything belonging to Viṣṇu.” Śrī Viṣṇu is *sac-cid-ānanda-vigraha.* Similarly, the most confidential servant of Kṛṣṇa, the spiritual master, and all devotees of Viṣṇu are *tadīya.* The *sac-cid-ānanda-vigraha, guru,* Vaiṣṇavas and things used by them must be considered *tadīya* and without a doubt worshipable by all living beings.

### Translation

**Śrī Rāmānanda Rāya was indeed a diplomatic minister for the King. His general behavior was very expert, and simply by describing the King’s love for Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, he gradually softened the Lord’s mind.**

### Purport

A diplomat in the material world knows how to deal with people, especially in political affairs. Some of the great devotees of the Lord — like Rāmānanda Rāya, Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī, Sanātana Gosvāmī and Rūpa Gosvāmī — were government officers and had a background of very opulent householder life. Consequently they knew how to deal with people. In many instances we have seen the diplomacy of Rūpa Gosvāmī, Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī and Rāmānanda Rāya employed in the service of the Lord. When Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī’s father and uncle were to be arrested by government officials, Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī hid them and personally met the government officers and settled the affair diplomatically. This is but one instance. Similarly, Sanātana Gosvāmī, after resigning his ministership, was thrown in jail, and he bribed the attendant of the jail so he could leave the clutches of the Nawab and live with Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Now we see Rāmānanda Rāya, a most confidential devotee of the Lord, diplomatically soften the heart of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, despite the fact that the Lord definitely decided not to meet the King. The diplomacy of Rāmānanda Rāya and entreaties of Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya and all the other great devotees succeeded. The conclusion is that diplomacy used for the service of the Lord is a form of devotional service.

### Translation

**“Here is a great devotee,” Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu said. “Upon seeing him, everyone can remember the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, son of Mahārāja Nanda.”**

### Purport

In his *Anubhāṣya,* Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura states that a materialist mistakenly accepts the body and mind as the source of material enjoyment. In other words, a materialist accepts the bodily conception of life. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu did not regard the son of Mahārāja Pratāparudra with the idea that he was a materialist, being the son of a materialist. Nor did He consider Himself the enjoyer. Māyāvādī philosophers make a great mistake by assuming that the *sac-cid-ānanda-vigraha,* the transcendental form of the Lord, is like a material body. However, there is no material contamination in transcendence, nor is there any possibility of imagining a spirituality in matter. One cannot accept matter as spirit. As indicated by the technical words *bhauma ijya-dhīḥ* (*Bhāg.* 10.84.13), materialistic Māyāvādīs imagine the form of God in matter, although according to their imagination, God is ultimately formless. This is simply mental speculation. Even though Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, He placed Himself in the position of a *gopī.* He also accepted the King’s son directly as the son of Mahārāja Nanda, Vrajendra-nandana Hari. This is perfect vision according to the direction of the Vedic culture, as confirmed in *Śrīmad Bhagavad-gītā:* *paṇḍitāḥ sama-darśinaḥ.* Such acceptance of the Absolute Truth according to Vaiṣṇava philosophy is explained in both the *Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad* (3.2.3) and the *Kaṭha Upaniṣad* (1.2.23) in the following words:

*nāyam ātmā pravacanena labhyo *
 *na medhayā na bahunā śrutena  
yam evaiṣa vṛṇute tena labhyas *
 *tasyaiṣa ātmā vivṛṇute tanūṁ svām*

“The Supreme Lord is not obtained by expert explanations, by vast intelligence, nor even by much hearing. He is obtained only by one whom He Himself chooses. To such a person He manifests His own form.”

The living entity is entangled in material existence due to his lack of such spiritual vision. Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura has sung in his *Kalyāṇa-kalpataru: saṁsāre āsiyā prakṛti bhajiyā ‘puruṣa’ abhimāne mari.* When the living entity comes to the material world, he thinks himself the enjoyer. Thus he becomes more and more entangled.

### Translation

**From then on, the fortunate prince was one of the most intimate devotees of the Lord.**

### Purport

In this regard, Śrīla Prabodhānanda Sarasvatī writes, *yat-kāruṇya-kaṭākṣa-vaibhava-vatām.* If Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu simply glanced at someone for a moment, that person immediately turned into one of the most confidential devotees of the Lord. The prince came to see the Lord for the first time, but by the Lord’s mercy the boy immediately became a topmost devotee. This was not in theory but in practice. We cannot apply the *nagna-mātṛkā-nyāya* formula. This states that if one’s mother was naked in her childhood, she should continue to remain naked, even though she has become the mother of so many children. If a person is actually blessed by the mercy of the Lord, he can immediately become a topmost devotee of the Lord. The logic of *nagna-mātṛkā* states that if a person is not elevated on such and such a date, he cannot become an exalted devotee overnight, as it were. This particular instance offers evidence to contradict that theory. On the previous day, the boy was simply an ordinary prince, and the next day he was counted as one of the topmost devotees of the Lord. This was all made possible by the causeless mercy of the Lord. The Lord is omnipotent — all-powerful or almighty — and He can act as He likes.

It is understood by hearsay that the wife of Indradyumna, the King who established the Jagannātha temple, was known as Guṇḍicā. There is also mention of the name of the Guṇḍicā temple in authoritative scripture. The area of the Guṇḍicā temple is estimated to be 288 cubits by 215 cubits (a cubit is about a foot and a half). The main temple inside is about 36 cubits by 30 cubits, and the *kīrtana* hall is 32 cubits by 30 cubits.

### Purport

It is significant that Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu told Svarūpa Dāmodara Gosvāmī that the Bengali Vaiṣṇava was “your Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava.” This means that all Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇavas who are followers of the Caitanya cult are subordinate to Svarūpa Dāmodara Gosvāmī. The *paramparā* system is very strictly observed by Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇavas. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s personal secretary was Svarūpa Dāmodara Gosvāmī. The next group of devotees was the six Gosvāmīs, then Kavirāja Gosvāmī. It is necessary to observe the *paramparā* system of the Caitanya cult. There are many offenses one can commit while serving the Lord, and these are described in the *Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu, Hari-bhakti-vilāsa* and other books. According to the rules and regulations, no one should accept obeisances in the temple of the Lord before the Deity. Nor is it proper for a devotee to offer obeisances and touch the feet of the spiritual master before the Deity. This is considered an offense. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu Himself was personally the Supreme Personality of Godhead; therefore it was not actually offensive to wash His lotus feet in the temple. However, because He was playing the part of an *ācārya,* the Lord considered Himself an ordinary human being. He also wanted to give instructions to ordinary human beings. The point is that even though one plays the part of a spiritual master, he should not accept obeisances or permit a disciple to wash his feet before the Deity. This is a matter of etiquette.

### Purport

In commenting on the cleansing of the Guṇḍicā temple, Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura says that Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, as the world leader, was personally giving instructions on how one should receive Lord Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, within one’s cleansed and pacified heart. If one wants to see Kṛṣṇa seated in his heart, he must first cleanse the heart, as prescribed by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu in His *Śikṣāṣṭaka: ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam.* In this age, everyone’s heart is especially unclean, as confirmed in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam: hṛdy antaḥ-stho hy abhadrāṇi.* To wash away all dirty things accumulated within the heart, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu advised everyone to chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra.* The first result will be that the heart is cleansed (*ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam*). Similarly, *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (1.2.17) confirms this statement:

*śṛṇvatāṁ sva-kathāḥ kṛṣṇaḥ* *puṇya-śravaṇa-kīrtanaḥ  
hṛdy antaḥ-stho hy abhadrāṇi* *vidhunoti suhṛt satām*

“Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the Personality of Godhead, who is the Paramātmā \[Supersoul\] in everyone’s heart and the benefactor of the truthful devotee, cleanses desire for material enjoyment from the heart of the devotee who relishes His messages, which are in themselves virtuous when properly heard and chanted.”

If a devotee at all wants to cleanse his heart, he must chant and hear the glories of the Lord, Śrī Kṛṣṇa (*śṛṇvatāṁ sva-kathāḥ kṛṣṇaḥ*). This is a simple process. Kṛṣṇa Himself will help cleanse the heart because He is already seated there. Kṛṣṇa wants to continue living within the heart, and the Lord wants to give directions, but one has to keep his heart as clean as Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu kept the Guṇḍicā temple. The devotee therefore has to cleanse his heart just as the Lord cleansed the Guṇḍicā temple. In this way one can be pacified and enriched in devotional service. If the heart is filled with straw, grains of sand, weeds or dust (in other words, *anyābhilāṣa-pūrṇa*), one cannot enthrone the Supreme Personality of Godhead there. The heart must be cleansed of all material motives brought about through fruitive work, speculative knowledge, the mystic *yoga* system and so many other forms of so-called meditation. The heart must be cleansed without ulterior motive. As Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī says, *anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyaṁ jñāna-karmādy-anāvṛtam.* In other words, there should not be any external motive. One should not attempt material upliftment, understanding the Supreme by speculative knowledge, fruitive activity, severe austerity and penance, and so on. All these activities are against the natural growth of spontaneous love of Godhead. As soon as these are present within the heart, the heart should be understood to be unclean and therefore unfit to serve as Kṛṣṇa’s sitting place. We cannot perceive the Lord’s presence in our hearts unless our hearts are cleansed.

A material desire is explained as a desire to enjoy the material world to its fullest extent. In modern language, this is called economic development. An inordinate desire for economic development is considered to be like straws and grains of sand within the heart. If one is overly engaged in material activity, the heart will always remain disturbed. As stated by Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura:

*saṁsāra viṣānale,* *divā-niśi hiyā jvale,  
juḍāite nā kainu upāya*

In other words, endeavor for material opulence is against the principle of devotional service. Material enjoyment includes activities such as great sacrifices for auspicious activity, charity, austerity, elevation to the higher planetary system, and even living happily within the material world.

Modernized material benefits are like the dust of material contamination. When this dust is agitated by the whirlwind of fruitive activity, it overcomes the heart. Thus the mirror of the heart is covered with dust. There are many desires to perform auspicious and inauspicious activities, but people do not know how life after life they are keeping their hearts unclean. One who cannot give up the desire for fruitive activity is understood to be covered by the dust of material contamination. *Karmīs* generally think that the interaction of fruitive activities can be counteracted by another *karma,* or fruitive activity. This is certainly a mistaken conception. If one is deluded by such a conception, he is cheated by his own activity. Such activities have been compared to an elephant’s bathing. An elephant may bathe very thoroughly, but as soon as it comes out of the river, it immediately takes some sand from the land and throws it all over its body. If one suffers due to his past fruitive activities, he cannot counteract his suffering by performing auspicious activities. The sufferings of human society cannot be counteracted by material plans. The only way suffering can be mitigated is by Kṛṣṇa consciousness. When one takes to Kṛṣṇa consciousness and engages himself in the devotional service of the Lord — beginning with chanting and hearing the glories of the Lord — the cleansing of the heart begins. When the heart is actually cleansed, one can clearly see the Lord sitting there without any disturbance. In *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (9.4.68) the Lord confirms that He sits within the heart of the pure devotee: *sādhavo hṛdayaṁ mahyaṁ sādhūnāṁ hṛdayaṁ tv aham.*

Impersonal speculation, monism (merging into the existence of the Supreme), speculative knowledge, mystic *yoga* and meditation are all compared to grains of sand. They simply cause irritation to the heart. No one can satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead by such activities, nor do we give the Lord a chance to sit in our hearts peacefully. Rather, the Lord is simply disturbed by them. Sometimes *yogīs* and *jñānīs* in the beginning take to the chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra* as a way to begin their various practices. But when they falsely think that they have attained release from the bondage of material existence, they give up chanting. They do not consider that the ultimate goal is the form of the Lord or the name of the Lord. Such unfortunate creatures are never favored by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for they do not know what devotional service is. Lord Kṛṣṇa describes them in the *Bhagavad-gītā* in this way:

*tān ahaṁ dviṣataḥ krūrān* *saṁsāreṣu narādhamān  
kṣipāmy ajasram aśubhān* *āsurīṣv eva yoniṣu*

“Those who are envious and mischievous, who are the lowest among men, I perpetually cast into the ocean of material existence, into various demoniac species of life.” (Bg. 16.19)

By His practical example, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu has shown us that all the grains of sand must be picked up thoroughly and thrown outside. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu also cleansed the outside of the temple, fearing that the grains of sand would again come within. In this connection, Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura explains that even though one may become free from the desire for fruitive activity, sometimes the subtle desire for fruitive activity again comes into being within the heart. One often thinks of conducting business to improve devotional activity. But the contamination is so strong that it may later develop into misunderstanding, described as *kuṭi-nāṭi* (faultfinding) and *pratiṣṭhāśā* (the desire for name and fame and for high position), *jīva-hiṁsā* (envy of other living entities), *niṣiddhācāra* (accepting things forbidden in the *śāstra*), *kāma* (desire for material gain) and *pūjā* (hankering for popularity). The word *kuṭi-nāṭi* means “duplicity.” As an example of *pratiṣṭhāśā,* one may attempt to imitate Śrīla Haridāsa Ṭhākura by living in a solitary place. One’s real desire may be for name and fame — in other words, one thinks that fools will accept one to be as good as Haridāsa Ṭhākura just because one lives in a solitary place. These are all material desires. A neophyte devotee is certain to be attacked by other material desires as well, namely desires for women and money. In this way the heart is again filled with dirty things and becomes harder and harder, like that of a materialist. Gradually one desires to become a reputed devotee or an *avatāra* (incarnation).

The word *jīva-hiṁsā* (envy of other living entities) actually means stopping the preaching of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Preaching work is described as *paropakāra,* welfare activity for others. Those who are ignorant of the benefits of devotional service must be educated by preaching. If one stops preaching and simply sits down in a solitary place, he is engaging in material activity. If one desires to make a compromise with the Māyāvādīs, he is also engaged in material activity. A devotee should never make compromises with nondevotees. By acting as a professional *guru,* mystic *yogī* or miracle man, one may cheat and bluff the general public and gain fame as a wonderful mystic, but all this is considered to be dust, straw and grains of sand within the heart. In addition, one should follow the regulative principles and not desire illicit sex, gambling, intoxicants or meat.

To give us practical instructions, Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu cleansed the temple twice. His second cleansing was more thorough. The idea was to throw away all the stumbling blocks on the path of devotional service. He cleansed the temple with firm conviction, as is evident from His using His own personal garments for cleaning. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu wanted to see personally that the temple was thoroughly cleansed to the standard of clean marble. Clean marble gives a cooling effect. Devotional service means attaining peace from all disturbances caused by material contamination. In other words, it is the process by which the mind is cooled. The mind can be peaceful and thoroughly cleansed when one no longer desires anything but devotional service.

Even though all dirty things may be cleansed away, sometimes subtle desires remain in the mind for impersonalism, monism, success and the four principles of religious activity (*dharma, artha, kāma* and *mokṣa*)*.* All these are like spots on clean cloth. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu also wanted to cleanse all these away.

By His practical activity, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu informed us how to cleanse our hearts. Once the heart is cleansed, we should invite Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa to sit down, and we should observe the festival by distributing *prasādam* and chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra.* Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu used to teach every devotee by His personal behavior. Everyone who spreads the cult of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu accepts a similar responsibility. The Lord was personally chastising and praising individuals in the course of the cleaning, and those who are engaged as *ācāryas* must learn from Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu how to train devotees by personal example. The Lord was very pleased with those who could cleanse the temple by taking out undesirable things accumulated within. This is called *anartha-nivṛtti,* cleansing the heart of all unwanted things. Thus the cleansing of the Guṇḍicā-mandira was conducted by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu to let us know how the heart should be cleansed and soothed to receive Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa and enable Him to sit within the heart without disturbance.

### Purport

Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya was previously a *smārta-brāhmaṇa* — that is, one who strictly follows the Vedic principles on the mundane platform. On the mundane platform one cannot believe that *prasādam* is transcendental, that Govinda is the original form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, or that a Vaiṣṇava is a liberated person. These transcendental considerations are out of the ordinary Vedic scholar’s jurisdiction. Most Vedic scholars are called Vedāntists. These so-called followers of Vedānta philosophy consider the Absolute Truth to be impersonal. They also believe that a person born in a particular caste cannot change his caste until he dies and takes rebirth. The *smārta-brāhmaṇas* also reject the fact that *mahā-prasādam* (food offered to the Deity) is transcendental and materially uncontaminated. Originally, Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya was subjected to all the rules and regulations of the Vedic principles on the mundane platform. Now Gopīnātha Ācārya pointed out how Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya had been converted by the causeless mercy of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Being converted, Sārvabhauma partook of *prasādam* with the Vaiṣṇavas. Indeed, he sat by the side of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

### Translation

**“Whereas I once associated with the disciples of logic, all nondevotees, I am now merged in the waves of the nectarean ocean of the association of devotees.”**

### Purport

As Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura explains, the word *bahirmukha* refers to a person who is very busy tasting material enjoyment. Such a person always poses himself as an enjoyer of the external energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Being attracted by external opulence, the nondevotee always forgets his intimate relationship with Kṛṣṇa. Such a person does not like the idea of becoming Kṛṣṇa conscious. This is explained by Śrīla Prahlāda Mahārāja in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (7.5.30-31):

*matir na kṛṣṇe parataḥ svato vā *
 *mitho ’bhipadyeta gṛha-vratānām  
adānta-gobhir viśatāṁ tamisraṁ *
 *punaḥ punaś carvita-carvaṇānām*

*na te viduḥ svārtha-gatiṁ hi viṣṇuṁ *
 *durāśayā ye bahir-artha-māninaḥ  
andhā yathāndhair upanīyamānās *
 *te ’pīśa-tantryām uru-dāmni baddhāḥ*

Materialists who are overly attracted to the material body, material world and material enjoyment, who cannot control their material senses, are carried to the darkest regions of material existence. Such people cannot become Kṛṣṇa conscious, either by themselves or by congregational effort. Such people do not understand that the goal of life for a human being is to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Viṣṇu. A human life is especially meant for this purpose, and one has to go through all kinds of penances and austerities and set aside the propensity for sense gratification. Materialists always remain blind because they are always guided by blind rascals. A materialistic person considers himself free to act as he likes. He does not know that he is rigidly controlled by the stringent laws of nature, nor does he know that he has to transmigrate from one body to another and perpetually rot in material existence. Such rascals and foolish people are lured by the prayers of their foolish leaders for sense gratification, and they cannot understand what is meant by Kṛṣṇa consciousness. The material world exists outside the spiritual sky, and a foolish materialist cannot estimate the extent of this material sky. What, then, can he know of the spiritual sky? Materialists simply believe their imperfect senses and do not take instructions from the revealed scriptures. According to Vedic civilization, one has to see through the authority of the revealed scriptures. *Śāstra-cakṣuḥ:* one should see everything through the medium of the Vedic literature. In this way, one can distinguish between the spiritual world and material world. Those who ignore such instructions cannot be convinced of the existence of the spiritual world. Because they have forgotten their spiritual identity, such materialists take this material world as the all in all. They are therefore called *bahirmukha.*

### Translation

**“One who participates in Your impersonal monistic philosophy does not accept anything but the one Brahman.”**

### Purport

The impersonal monist does not believe that God is the only object of worship and that the living entities are His eternal servants. According to the monists, God and the devotee may be separate in the material state, but when they are spiritually situated, there is no difference between them. This is called *advaita-siddhānta,* the conclusion of the monists. Monists consider devotional service of the Lord to be material activity; therefore they consider such devotional activities to be the same as *karma,* or fruitive activity. This monistic mistake is a great stumbling block on the road to devotional service.

Actually this discussion between Advaita Ācārya and Nityānanda was a mock fight to serve as a great instruction for all devotees. Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu wanted to point out that Advaita Ācārya, a pure devotee, did not agree with the monistic conclusion. The conclusion of devotional service is:

*vadanti tat tattva-vidas* *tattvaṁ yaj jñānam advayam  
brahmeti paramātmeti* *bhagavān iti śabdyate*

“Learned transcendentalists who know the Absolute Truth call this nondual substance Brahman, Paramātmā or Bhagavān.” (*Bhāg.* 1.2.11)

Absolute knowledge consists of Brahman, Paramātmā and Bhagavān. This conclusion is not the same as that of the monists. Śrīla Advaita Ācārya was given the title of *ācārya* because He spread the *bhakti* cult, not the philosophy of monism. The true conclusion of *advaita-siddhānta,* expressed at the very beginning of the *Caitanya-caritāmṛta* (*Ādi* 1.3)*,* is not the same as the philosophy of the monists. Here *advaita-siddhānta* means *advaya-jñāna,* or oneness in variety. Actually Śrīla Nityānanda Prabhu was praising Śrīla Advaita Ācārya through friendly mock fighting. He was giving the Vaiṣṇava conclusion in terms of the *Bhāgavatam’s* conclusive words, *vadanti tat tattva-vidaḥ.* This is also the conclusion of a *mantra* in the *Chāndogya Upaniṣad, ekam evādvitīyam.*

A devotee knows that there is oneness in diversity. The *mantras* of the *śāstras* do not support the monistic conclusions of the impersonalists, nor does Vaiṣṇava philosophy accept impersonalism without variety. Brahman is the greatest, He who includes everything, and that is oneness. As Kṛṣṇa says in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (7.7), *mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat:* there is no one superior to Kṛṣṇa Himself. He is the original substance because every category emanates from Him. Thus He is simultaneously one with and different from all other categories. The Lord is always engaged in a variety of spiritual activities, but the monist cannot understand spiritual variety. The conclusion is that although the powerful and the power are one and the same, within the energy of the powerful there are varieties. In those varieties there is a distinction between the different parts of one’s personal self, between types of the same category, and between types of different categories. In other words, there is always variety in the categories, which are understood as knowledge, the knower and the knowable. Due to the eternal existence of knowledge, the knower and the knowable, devotees everywhere know about the eternal existence of the form, name, qualities, pastimes and entourage of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Devotees never agree with the monists’ preaching of oneness. Unless one adheres to the conceptions of the knower, the knowable and knowledge, there is no possibility of understanding spiritual variety, nor can one taste the transcendental bliss of spiritual variety.

The philosophy of monism is an adjustment of the Buddhist philosophy of voidism. In a mock fight with Śrī Advaita Ācārya, Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu was refuting this type of monistic philosophy. Vaiṣṇavas certainly accept Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa as the ultimate “one,” and that which is without Kṛṣṇa is called *māyā,* or that which has no existence. External *māyā* is exhibited in two phases — *jīva-māyā,* the living entities, and *guṇa-māyā,* the material world. In the material world there is *prakṛti* (material nature) and *pradhāna* (the ingredients of material nature). However, for one who becomes Kṛṣṇa conscious, the distinction between material and spiritual varieties does not exist. An advanced devotee like Prahlāda Mahārāja sees everything as one — Kṛṣṇa. As stated in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (7.4.37)*, kṛṣṇa-graha-gṛhītātmā na veda jagad īdṛśam*. One who is in full Kṛṣṇa consciousness does not distinguish between things material and spiritual; he takes everything to be related to Kṛṣṇa and therefore spiritual. By *advaya-jñāna-darśana,* Śrīla Advaita Ācārya has glorified pure devotional service. Śrīla Nityānanda Prabhu herein sarcastically condemns the philosophy of the impersonal monists and praises the correct nondual philosophy of Śrī Advaita Prabhu.

हेन तोमार सङ्गे मेार एकत्रे भोजन ।  
ना जानि, तोमार सङ्गे कैछे हय़ मन ॥ १९५ ॥

### Verse text

*hena tomāra saṅge mora ekatre bhojana  
nā jāni, tomāra saṅge kaiche haya mana*

### Synonyms

*hena* — thus; *tomāra* — Your; *saṅge* — in association; *mora* — My; *ekatre* — together; *bhojana* — eating; *nā* *jāni* — I do not know; *tomāra* *saṅge* — by Your association; *kaiche* — how; *haya* *mana* — My mind will turn.

### Translation

**Nityānanda Prabhu continued, “You are such a monist! And now I am eating beside You. I do not know how My mind will be affected in this way.”**

### Purport

*Saṅgāt sañjāyate kāmaḥ* (Bg. 2.62). One develops his consciousness according to society and association. As Śrīla Nityānanda Prabhu admits, a devotee should be very careful when associating with those who are not devotees. When asked by a householder devotee what the behavior of a devotee should be, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu immediately replied:

*asat-saṅga-tyāga, — ei vaiṣṇava-ācāra  
‘strī-saṅgī’ — eka asādhu, ‘kṛṣṇābhakta’ āra*

(Cc. *Madhya* 22.87)

A Vaiṣṇava, a devotee, should simply discard intimate association with nondevotees. In his *Upadeśāmṛta,* Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī has described the symptoms of intimate relationships in this way:

*dadāti pratigṛhṇāti* *guhyam ākhyāti pṛcchati  
bhuṅkte bhojayate caiva* *ṣaḍ-vidhaṁ prīti-lakṣaṇam*

The words *bhuṅkte bhojayate* indicate that one should eat with devotees. One should carefully avoid eating food offered by nondevotees. Indeed, a devotee should be very strict in not accepting food from a nondevotee, especially food prepared in restaurants or hotels or on airplanes. Śrīla Nityānanda Prabhu’s reference in this connection is meant to emphasize that one should avoid eating with Māyāvādīs and covert Māyāvādīs like the *sahajiyā* Vaiṣṇavas, who are materially affected.

### Translation

### Purport

Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu usually saw Lord Jagannātha from a distance, standing behind the column of Garuḍa. But because he had not seen Lord Jagannātha for fifteen days, Caitanya Mahāprabhu felt great separation from Him. In great eagerness, Caitanya Mahāprabhu crossed the meeting hall and entered the room where food was offered, just to see the face of Lord Jagannātha. In verse 210, this action is called *maryādā-laṅghana,* a violation of the regulative principles. This indicates that one should not come very near a superior. Both the Lord’s Deity form and the spiritual master should be seen from a distant place. This is called *maryādā.* Otherwise, as it is said, familiarity breeds contempt. Sometimes coming too near the Deity or the spiritual master degrades the neophyte devotee. Personal servants of the Deity and the spiritual master should therefore always be very careful, for negligence may overcome them in their duty.

Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s eyes have been compared to thirsty bumblebees, and Śrī Jagannātha’s eyes have been compared to blossoming lotus flowers. The author has made these comparisons in order to describe Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu while the Lord was deeply absorbed in ecstatic love for Lord Jagannātha.

“The beauty of the son of Mahārāja Nanda is incomparable. Nothing is higher than His beauty, and nothing can equal it. His beauty is like waves in an ocean of nectar. This beauty is attractive both for moving and for nonmoving objects.”

Similarly, in the *tantra-śāstra* there is another description of the Lord’s beauty:

*kandarpa-koṭy-arbuda-rūpa-śobha- *
 *nīrājya-pādābja-nakhāñcalasya  
kutrāpy adṛṣṭa-śruta-ramya-kānter *
 *dhyānaṁ paraṁ nanda-sutasya vakṣye*

“I shall relate the supreme meditation upon Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the son of Nanda Mahārāja. The tips of the toes of His lotus feet reflect the beauty of the bodies of unlimited millions of Cupids, and His bodily luster has never been seen or heard of anywhere.”

One may also consult *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (10.29.14) in this connection.
