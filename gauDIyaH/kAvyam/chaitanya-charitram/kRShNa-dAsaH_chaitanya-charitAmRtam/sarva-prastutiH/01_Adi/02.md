CHAPTER TWO

This chapter explains that Lord Caitanya is the Supreme Personality of Godhead Kṛṣṇa Himself. Therefore, the Brahman effulgence is the bodily luster of Lord Caitanya, and the localized Supersoul situated in the heart of every living entity is His partial representation. The *puruṣa-avatāras* are also explained in this connection. Mahā-Viṣṇu is the reservoir of all conditioned souls, but, as confirmed in the authoritative scriptures, Lord Kṛṣṇa is the ultimate fountainhead, the source of numerous plenary expansions, including Nārāyaṇa, who is generally accepted by Māyāvādī philosophers to be the Absolute Truth. The Lord’s manifestation of *prābhava* and *vaibhava* expansions, as well as partial incarnations and incarnations with delegated powers, are also explained. Lord Kṛṣṇa’s ages of boyhood and youth are discussed, and it is explained that His age at the beginning of youth is His eternal form.

The spiritual sky contains innumerable spiritual planets, the Vaikuṇṭhas, which are manifestations of the Supreme Lord’s internal energy. Innumerable material universes are similarly exhibited by His external energy, and the living entities are manifested by His marginal energy. Because Lord Kṛṣṇa Caitanya is not different from Lord Kṛṣṇa, He is the cause of all causes; there is no cause beyond Him. He is eternal, and His form is spiritual. Lord Caitanya is directly the Supreme Lord, Kṛṣṇa, as the evidence of authoritative scriptures proves. This chapter stresses that a devotee who wishes to advance in Kṛṣṇa consciousness must have knowledge of Kṛṣṇa’s personal form, His three principal energies, His pastimes and the relationship of the living entities with Him.

### Purport

By the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, even an inexperienced boy with no educational culture can be saved from the ocean of nescience, which is full of various types of philosophical doctrines that are like dangerous aquatic animals. The philosophy of the Buddha, the argumentative presentations of the *jñānīs,* the *yoga* systems of Patañjali and Gautama, and the systems of philosophers like Kaṇāda, Kapila and Dattātreya are dangerous creatures in the ocean of nescience. By the grace of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu one can have real understanding of the essence of knowledge by avoiding these sectarian views and accepting the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa as the ultimate goal of life. Let us all worship Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu for His gracious mercy to the conditioned souls.

### Translation

**O my merciful Lord Caitanya, may the nectarean Ganges waters of Your transcendental activities flow on the surface of my desertlike tongue. Beautifying these waters are the lotus flowers of singing, dancing and loud chanting of Kṛṣṇa’s holy name, which are the pleasure abodes of unalloyed devotees. These devotees are compared to swans, ducks and bees. The river’s flowing produces a melodious sound that gladdens their ears.**

### Purport

Our tongues always engage in vibrating useless sounds that do not help us realize transcendental peace. The tongue is compared to a desert because a desert needs a constant supply of refreshing water to make it fertile and fruitful. Water is the substance most needed in the desert. The transient pleasure derived from mundane topics of art, culture, politics, sociology, dry philosophy, poetry and so on is compared to a mere drop of water because although such topics have a qualitative feature of transcendental pleasure, they are saturated with the modes of material nature. Therefore neither collectively nor individually can they satisfy the vast requirements of the desertlike tongue. Despite crying in various conferences, therefore, the desertlike tongue continues to be parched. For this reason, people from all parts of the world must call for the devotees of Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, who are compared to swans swimming around the beautiful lotus feet of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu or bees humming around His lotus feet in transcendental pleasure, searching for honey. The dryness of material happiness cannot be moistened by so-called philosophers who cry for Brahman, liberation and similar dry speculative objects. The urge of the soul proper is different. The soul can be solaced only by the mercy of Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and His many bona fide devotees, who never leave the lotus feet of the Lord to become imitation Mahāprabhus but all cling to His lotus feet like bees that never leave a honey-soaked lotus flower.

Lord Caitanya’s movement of Kṛṣṇa consciousness is full of dancing and singing about the pastimes of Lord Kṛṣṇa. It is compared herein to the pure waters of the Ganges, which are full of lotus flowers. The enjoyers of these lotus flowers are the pure devotees, who are like bees and swans. They chant like the flowing of the Ganges, the river of the celestial kingdom. The author desires such sweetly flowing waves to cover his tongue. He humbly compares himself to materialistic persons who always engage in dry talk from which they derive no satisfaction. If they were to use their dry tongues to chant the holy name of the Lord — Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare — as exemplified by Lord Caitanya, they would taste sweet nectar and enjoy life.

### Translation

**What the Upaniṣads describe as the impersonal Brahman is but the effulgence of His body, and the Lord known as the Supersoul is but His localized plenary portion. Lord Caitanya is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa Himself, full with six opulences. He is the Absolute Truth, and no other truth is greater than or equal to Him.**

### Purport

The compilers of the *Upaniṣads* speak very highly of the impersonal Brahman. The *Upaniṣads,* which are considered the most elevated portion of the Vedic literatures, are meant for persons who desire to get free from material association and who therefore approach a bona fide spiritual master for enlightenment. The prefix *upa-* indicates that one must receive knowledge about the Absolute Truth from a spiritual master. One who has faith in his spiritual master actually receives transcendental instruction, and as his attachment for material life slackens, he is able to advance on the spiritual path. Knowledge of the transcendental science of the *Upaniṣads* can free one from the entanglement of existence in the material world, and when thus liberated, one can be elevated to the spiritual kingdom of the Supreme Personality of Godhead by advancement in spiritual life.

The beginning of spiritual enlightenment is realization of impersonal Brahman. Such realization is effected by gradual negation of material variegatedness. Impersonal Brahman realization is the partial, distant experience of the Absolute Truth that one achieves through the rational approach. It is compared to one’s seeing a hill from a distance and taking it to be a smoky cloud. A hill is not a smoky cloud, but it appears to be one from a distance because of our imperfect vision. In imperfect or smoky realization of the Absolute Truth, spiritual variegatedness is conspicuous by its absence. This experience is therefore called *advaita-vāda,* or realization of the oneness of the Absolute.

The impersonal glowing effulgence of Brahman consists only of the personal bodily rays of the Supreme Godhead, Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Since Śrī Gaurasundara, or Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, is identical with Śrī Kṛṣṇa Himself, the Brahman effulgence consists of the rays of His transcendental body.

Similarly, the Supersoul, which is called the Paramātmā, is a plenary representation of Caitanya Mahāprabhu. The *antar-yāmī,* the Supersoul in everyone’s heart, is the controller of all living entities. This is confirmed in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (15.15), wherein Lord Kṛṣṇa says, *sarvasya cāhaṁ hṛdi sanniviṣṭaḥ:* “I am situated in everyone’s heart.” The *Bhagavad-gītā* (5.29) also states, *bhoktāraṁ yajña-tapasāṁ sarva-loka-maheśvaram,* indicating that the Supreme Lord, acting in His expansion as the Supersoul, is the proprietor of everything. Similarly, the *Brahma-saṁhitā* (5.35) states, *aṇḍāntara-stha-paramāṇu-cayāntara-stham.* The Lord is present everywhere, within the heart of every living entity and within each and every atom as well. Thus by this Supersoul feature the Lord is all-pervading.

Furthermore, Lord Caitanya is also the master of all wealth, strength, fame, beauty, knowledge and renunciation because He is Śrī Kṛṣṇa Himself. He is described as *pūrṇa,* or complete. In the feature of Lord Caitanya, the Lord is an ideal renouncer, just as Śrī Rāma was an ideal king. Lord Caitanya accepted the order of *sannyāsa* and exemplified exceedingly wonderful principles in His own life. No one can compare to Him in the order of *sannyāsa.* Although in Kali-yuga acceptance of the *sannyāsa* order is generally forbidden, Lord Caitanya accepted it because He is complete in renunciation. Others cannot imitate Him but can only follow in His footsteps as far as possible. Those who are unfit for this order of life are strictly forbidden by the injunctions of the ś*āstras* to accept it. Lord Caitanya, however, is complete in renunciation as well as all other opulences. He is therefore the highest principle of the Absolute Truth.

By an analytical study of the truth of Lord Caitanya, one will find that He is not different from the Supreme Personality of Godhead Kṛṣṇa; no one is greater than or even equal to Him. In the *Bhagavad-gītā* (7.7) Lord Kṛṣṇa says to Arjuna, *mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat kiñcid asti dhanañjaya:* “O conqueror of wealth \[Arjuna\], there is no truth superior to Me.” Thus it is here confirmed that there is no truth higher than Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya.

The impersonal Brahman is the goal of those who cultivate the study of books of transcendental knowledge, and the Supersoul is the goal of those who perform the *yoga* practices. One who knows the Supreme Personality of Godhead surpasses realization of both Brahman and Paramātmā because Bhagavān is the ultimate platform of absolute knowledge.

The Personality of Godhead is the complete form of *sac-cid-ānanda* (full life, knowledge and bliss). By realization of the *sat* portion of the Complete Whole (unlimited existence), one realizes the impersonal Brahman aspect of the Lord. By realization of the *cit* portion of the Complete Whole (unlimited knowledge), one can realize the localized aspect of the Lord, the Paramātmā. But neither of these partial realizations of the Complete Whole can help one realize *ānanda,* or complete bliss. Without such realization of *ānanda,* knowledge of the Absolute Truth is incomplete.

This verse of the *Caitanya-caritāmṛta* by Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī is confirmed by a parallel statement in the *Tattva-sandarbha,* by Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī. In the Eighth Part of the *Tattva-sandarbha* it is said that the Absolute Truth is sometimes approached as impersonal Brahman, which, although spiritual, is only a partial representation of the Absolute Truth. Nārāyaṇa, the predominating Deity in Vaikuṇṭha, is to be known as an expansion of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, but Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Absolute Truth, the object of the transcendental love of all living entities.

### Translation

### Purport

According to the rules of rhetorical arrangement for efficient composition in literature, a subject should be mentioned before its predicate. The Vedic literature frequently mentions Brahman, Paramātmā and Bhagavān, and therefore these three terms are widely known as the subjects of transcendental understanding. But it is not widely known that what is approached as the impersonal Brahman is the effulgence of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s transcendental body. Nor is it widely known that the Supersoul, or Paramātmā, is only a partial representation of Lord Caitanya, who is identical with Bhagavān Himself. Therefore the descriptions of Brahman as the effulgence of Lord Caitanya, the Paramātmā as His partial representation, and the Supreme Personality of Godhead Kṛṣṇa as identical with Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu must be verified by evidence from authoritative Vedic literatures.

The author wants to establish first that the essence of the *Vedas* is the *viṣṇu-tattva,* the Absolute Truth, Viṣṇu, the all-pervading Godhead. The *viṣṇu-tattva* has different categories, of which the highest is Lord Kṛṣṇa, the ultimate *viṣṇu-tattva,* as confirmed in the *Bhagavad-gītā* and throughout the Vedic literature. In *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* the same Supreme Personality of Godhead Kṛṣṇa is described as Nanda-suta, the son of King Nanda. Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī says that Nandasuta has again appeared as Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and he bases this statement on his understanding that the Vedic literature concludes there is no difference between Lord Kṛṣṇa and Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. This the author will prove. If it is thus proved that Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the origin of all *tattvas* (truths), namely Brahman, Paramātmā and Bhagavān, and that there is no difference between Śrī Kṛṣṇa and Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, it will not be difficult to understand that Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is also the same origin of all *tattvas.* The same Absolute Truth, as He is revealed to students of different realizations, is called Brahman, Paramātmā and Bhagavān.

### Translation

**In terms of His various manifestations, He is known in three features, called the impersonal Brahman, the localized Paramātmā and the original Personality of Godhead.**

### Purport

Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī has explained the word *bhagavān* in his *Bhagavat-sandarbha.* The Personality of Godhead, being full of all conceivable and inconceivable potencies, is the absolute Supreme Whole. Impersonal Brahman is a partial manifestation of the Absolute Truth realized in the absence of such complete potencies. The first syllable of the word *bhagavān* is *bha,* which means “sustainer” and “protector.” The next letter, *ga,* means “leader,” “pusher” and “creator.” *Va* means “dwelling” (all living beings dwell in the Supreme Lord, and the Supreme Lord dwells within the heart of every living being). Combining all these concepts, the word *bhagavān* carries the import of inconceivable potency in knowledge, energy, strength, opulence, power and influence, devoid of all varieties of inferiority. Without such inconceivable potencies, one cannot fully sustain or protect. Our modern civilization is sustained by scientific arrangements devised by many great scientific brains. We can just imagine, therefore, the gigantic brain whose arrangements sustain the gravity of the unlimited number of planets and satellites and who creates the unlimited space in which they float. If one considers the intelligence needed to orbit man-made satellites, one cannot be fooled into thinking that there is not a gigantic intelligence responsible for the arrangements of the various planetary systems. There is no reason to believe that all the gigantic planets float in space without the superior arrangement of a superior intelligence. This subject is clearly dealt with in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (15.13), where the Personality of Godhead says, “I enter into each planet, and by My energy they stay in orbit.” Were the planets not held in the grip of the Personality of Godhead, they would all scatter like dust in the air. Modern scientists can only impractically explain this inconceivable strength of the Personality of Godhead.

The potencies of the syllables *bha, ga* and *va* apply in terms of many different meanings. Through His different potent agents, the Lord protects and sustains everything, but He Himself personally protects and sustains only His devotees, just as a king personally sustains and protects his own children, while entrusting the protection and sustenance of the state to various administrative agents. The Lord is the leader of His devotees, as we learn from the *Bhagavad-gītā,* which mentions that the Personality of Godhead personally instructs His loving devotees how to make certain progress on the path of devotion and thus surely approach the kingdom of God. The Lord is also the recipient of all the adoration offered by His devotees, for whom He is the objective and the goal. For His devotees the Lord creates a favorable condition for developing a sense of transcendental love of Godhead. Sometimes He does this by taking away a devotee’s material attachments by force and baffling all his material protective agents, for thus the devotee must completely depend on the Lord’s protection. In this way the Lord proves Himself the leader of His devotees.

The Lord is not directly attached to the creation, maintenance and destruction of the material world, for He is eternally busy in the enjoyment of transcendental bliss with paraphernalia composed of His internal potencies. Yet as the initiator of the material energy as well as the marginal potency (the living beings), He expands Himself as the *puruṣa-avatāras,* who are invested with potencies similar to His. The *puruṣa-avatāras* are also in the category of *bhagavat-tattva* because each and every one of them is identical with the original form of the Personality of Godhead. The living entities are His infinitesimal particles and are qualitatively one with Him. They are sent into this material world for material enjoyment, to fulfill their desires to be independent individuals, but still they are subject to the supreme will of the Lord. The Lord deputes Himself in the state of Supersoul to supervise the arrangements for such material enjoyment. The example of a temporary fair is quite appropriate in this connection. If the citizens of a state assemble in a fair to enjoy for a short period, the government deputes a special officer to supervise it. Such an officer is invested with all governmental power, and therefore he is identical with the government. When the fair is over, there is no need for such an officer, and he returns home. The Paramātmā is compared to such an officer.

The living beings are not all in all. They are undoubtedly parts of the Supreme Lord and are qualitatively one with Him, yet they are subject to His control. Thus they are never equal to the Lord or one with Him. The Lord who associates with the living being is the Paramātmā, or supreme living being. No one, therefore, should view the tiny living beings and supreme living being to be on an equal level.

The all-pervading truth that exists eternally during the creation, maintenance and annihilation of the material world and in which the living beings rest in trance is called the impersonal Brahman.

### Translation

**“Learned transcendentalists who know the Absolute Truth say that it is nondual knowledge and is called impersonal Brahman, the localized Paramātmā and the Personality of Godhead.”**

### Purport

This Sanskrit verse appears as the eleventh verse of the First Canto, second chapter, of *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,* where Sūta Gosvāmī answers the questions of the sages headed by Śaunaka Ṛṣi concerning the essence of all scriptural instructions. *Tattva-vidaḥ* refers to persons who have knowledge of the Absolute Truth. They can certainly understand knowledge without duality because they are on the spiritual platform. The Absolute Truth is known sometimes as Brahman, sometimes as Paramātmā and sometimes as Bhagavān. Persons who are in knowledge of the truth know that one who tries to approach the Absolute simply by mental speculation will ultimately realize the impersonal Brahman, and one who tries to approach the Absolute through *yoga* practice will be able to realize Paramātmā, but one who has complete knowledge and spiritual understanding realizes the spiritual form of Bhagavān, the Personality of Godhead.

Devotees of the Personality of Godhead know that Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the son of the King of Vraja, is the Absolute Truth. They do not discriminate between Śrī Kṛṣṇa’s name, form, qualities and pastimes. One who wants to separate the Lord’s absolute name, form and qualities from the Lord Himself must be understood to be lacking in absolute knowledge. A pure devotee knows that when he chants the transcendental name “Kṛṣṇa,” Śrī Kṛṣṇa is present as transcendental sound. He therefore chants with full respect and veneration. When he sees the forms of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, he does not see anything different from the Lord. If one sees otherwise, he must be considered untrained in absolute knowledge. This lack of absolute knowledge is called *māyā.* One who is not Kṛṣṇa conscious is ruled by the spell of *māyā* under the control of a duality in knowledge. In the Absolute, all manifestations of the Supreme Lord are nondual, just as the multifarious forms of Viṣṇu, the controller of *māyā,* are nondual. Empiric philosophers who pursue the impersonal Brahman accept only the knowledge that the personality of the living entity is not different from the personality of the Supreme Lord, and mystic *yogīs* who try to locate the Paramātmā accept only the knowledge that the pure soul is not different from the Supersoul. The absolute conception of a pure devotee, however, includes all others. A devotee does not see anything except in its relationship with Kṛṣṇa, and therefore his realization is the most perfect of all.

### Verse text

*tāṅhāra aṅgera śuddha kiraṇa-maṇḍala  
upaniṣat kahe tāṅre brahma sunirmala*

### Synonyms

*tāṅhāra* — His; *aṅgera* — of the body; *śuddha* — pure; *kiraṇa* — of rays; *maṇḍala* — realm; *upaniṣat* — the *Upaniṣads*; *kahe* — say; *tāṅre* — unto that; *brahma* — Brahman; *su*-*nirmala* — transcendental.

### Translation

**What the Upaniṣads call the transcendental, impersonal Brahman is the realm of the glowing effulgence of the same Supreme Person.**

### Purport

Three *mantras* of the *Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad* (2.2.9-11) give information regarding the bodily effulgence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. They state:

*hiraṇmaye pare kośe* *virajaṁ brahma niṣkalam  
tac chubhraṁ jyotiṣāṁ jyotis* *tad yad ātma-vido viduḥ*

*na tatra sūryo bhāti na candra-tārakaṁ *
 *nemā vidyuto bhānti kuto ’yam agniḥ  
tam eva bhāntam anubhāti sarvaṁ *
 *tasya bhāsā sarvam idaṁ vibhāti*

*brahmaivedam amṛtaṁ purastād brahma *
 *paścād brahma dakṣiṇataś cottareṇa  
adhaś cordhvaṁ ca prasṛtaṁ brahmai- *
 *vedaṁ viśvam idaṁ variṣṭham*

“In the spiritual realm, beyond the material covering, is the unlimited Brahman effulgence, which is free from material contamination. That effulgent white light is understood by transcendentalists to be the light of all lights. In that realm there is no need of sunshine, moonshine, fire or electricity for illumination. Indeed, whatever illumination appears in the material world is only a reflection of that supreme illumination. That Brahman is in front and in back, in the north, south, east and west, and also overhead and below. In other words, that supreme Brahman effulgence spreads throughout both the material and spiritual skies.”

### Translation

**“I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, who is endowed with great power. The glowing effulgence of His transcendental form is the impersonal Brahman, which is absolute, complete and unlimited and which displays the varieties of countless planets, with their different opulences, in millions and millions of universes.”**

### Purport

This verse appears in the *Brahma-saṁhitā* (5.40). Each and every one of the countless universes is full of innumerable planets with different constitutions and atmospheres. All these come from the unlimited nondual Brahman, or Complete Whole, which exists in absolute knowledge. The origin of that unlimited Brahman effulgence is the transcendental body of Govinda, who is offered respectful obeisances as the original and supreme Personality of Godhead.

tāṅhāra prasāde mora haya sṛṣṭi-śakti*

### Synonyms

*sei* — that; *govinda* — Lord Govinda; *bhaji* — worship; *āmi* — I; *tehoṅ* — He; *mora* — my; *pati* — Lord; *tāṅhāra* — His; *prasāde* — by the mercy; *mora* — my; *haya* — becomes; *sṛṣṭi* — of creation; *śakti* — power.

### Translation

**“I worship Govinda. He is my Lord. Only by His grace am I empowered to create the universe.”**

### Purport

Although the sun is situated far away from the other planets, its rays sustain and maintain them all. Indeed, the sun diffuses its heat and light all over the universe. Similarly, the supreme sun, Govinda, diffuses His heat and light everywhere in the form of His different potencies. The sun’s heat and light are nondifferent from the sun. In the same way, the unlimited potencies of Govinda are nondifferent from Govinda Himself. Therefore the all-pervasive Brahman is the all-pervasive Govinda. The *Bhagavad-gītā* (14.27) clearly mentions that the impersonal Brahman is dependent upon Govinda. That is the real conception of absolute knowledge.

### Synonyms

*munayaḥ* — saints; *vāta*-*vāsanāḥ* — naked; *śramanāḥ* — who perform severe physical penances; *ūrdhva* — raised up; *manthinaḥ* — whose semen; *brahma*-*ākhyam* — known as Brahmaloka; *dhāma* — to the abode; *te* — they; *yānti* — go; *śāntāḥ* — equipoised in Brahman; *sannyāsinaḥ* — who are in the renounced order of life; *amalāḥ* — pure.

### Translation

**“Naked saints and sannyāsīs who undergo severe physical penances, who can raise the semen to the brain, and who are completely equipoised in Brahman can live in the realm known as Brahmaloka.”**

### Purport

In this verse from *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (11.6.47), *vāta-vāsanāḥ* refers to mendicants who do not care about anything material, including clothing, but who depend wholly on nature. Such sages do not cover their bodies even in severe winter or scorching sunshine. They take great pains not to avoid any kind of bodily suffering, and they live by begging from door to door. They never discharge their semen, either knowingly or unknowingly. By such celibacy they are able to raise the semen to the brain. Thus they become most intelligent and develop very sharp memories. Their minds are never disturbed or diverted from contemplation on the Absolute Truth, nor are they ever contaminated by desire for material enjoyment. By practicing austerities under strict discipline, such mendicants attain a neutral state transcendental to the modes of nature and merge into the impersonal Brahman.

*ātmāntaryāmī yāṅre yoga-śāstre kaya  
seha govindera aṁśa vibhūti ye haya*

### Synonyms

*ātmā* *antaḥ*-*yāmī* — in-dwelling Supersoul; *yāṅre* — who; *yoga*-*śāstre* — in the scriptures of *yoga*; *kaya* — is spoken; *seha* — that; *govindera* — of Govinda; *aṁśa* — plenary portion; *vibhūti* — expansion; *ye* — which; *haya* — is.

### Translation

**He who is described in the yoga-śāstras as the indwelling Supersoul \[ātmā antar-yāmī\] is also a plenary portion of Govinda’s personal expansion.**

### Purport

The Supreme Personality of Godhead is by nature joyful. His enjoyments, or pastimes, are completely transcendental. He is in the fourth dimension of existence, for although the material world is measured by the limitations of length, breadth and height, the Supreme Lord is completely unlimited in His body, form and existence. He is not personally attached to any of the affairs within the material cosmos. The material world is created by the expansion of His *puruṣa-avatāras,* who direct the aggregate material energy and all the conditioned souls. By understanding the three expansions of the *puruṣa,* a living entity can transcend the position of knowing only the twenty-four elements of the material world.

One of the expansions of Mahā-Viṣṇu is Kṣīrodakaśāyī Viṣṇu, the Supersoul within every living entity. As the Supersoul of the total aggregate of living entities, or the second *puruṣa,* He is known as Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu. As the creator or original cause of innumerable universes, or the first *puruṣa,* who is lying on the Causal Ocean, He is called Mahā-Viṣṇu. The three *puruṣas* direct the affairs of the material world.

The authorized scriptures direct the individual souls to revive their relationship with the Supersoul. Indeed, the system of *yoga* is the process of transcending the influence of the material elements by establishing a connection with the *puruṣa* known as Paramātmā. One who has thoroughly studied the intricacies of creation can know very easily that this Paramātmā is the plenary portion of the Supreme Being, Śrī Kṛṣṇa.

### Translation

**As the one sun appears reflected in countless jewels, so Govinda manifests Himself \[as Paramātmā\] in the hearts of all living beings.**

### Purport

The sun is situated in a specific location but is reflected in countless jewels and appears in innumerable localized aspects. Similarly, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, although eternally present in His transcendental abode, Goloka Vṛndāvana, is reflected in everyone’s heart as the Supersoul. In the *Upaniṣads* it is said that the *jīva* (living entity) and the Paramātmā (Supersoul) are like two birds sitting in the same tree. The Supersoul engages the living being in executing fruitive work as a result of his deeds in the past, but the Paramātmā has nothing to do with such engagements. As soon as the living being ceases to act in terms of fruitive work and takes to the service of the Lord (the Paramātmā), coming to know of His supremacy, he is immediately freed from all designations, and in that pure state he enters the kingdom of God, known as Vaikuṇṭha.

The Paramātmā, or Supersoul, the guide of the individual living beings, does not take part in fulfilling the desires of the living beings, but He arranges for their fulfillment by material nature. As soon as an individual soul becomes conscious of his eternal relationship with the Supersoul and looks only toward Him, he at once becomes free from the entanglements of material enjoyment. Christian philosophers who do not believe in the law of *karma* put forward the argument that it is absurd to say one must accept the results of past deeds of which he has no consciousness. A criminal is first reminded of his misdeeds by witnesses in a law court, and then he is punished. If death is complete forgetfulness, why should a person be punished for his past misdeeds? The conception of the Paramātmā is an invincible answer to these fallacious arguments. The Paramātmā is the witness of the past activities of the individual living being. A man may not remember what he has done in his childhood, but his father, who has seen him grow through different stages of development, certainly remembers. Similarly, the living being undergoes many changes of body through many lives, but the Supersoul is always with him and remembers all his activities, despite his evolution through different bodies.

### Translation

**\[Grandfather Bhīṣma said:\] “As the one sun appears differently situated to different seers, so also do You, the unborn, appear differently represented as the Paramātmā in every living being. But when a seer knows himself to be one of Your own servitors, no longer does he maintain such duality. Thus I am now able to comprehend Your eternal forms, knowing well the Paramātmā to be only Your plenary portion.”**

### Purport

This verse from *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (1.9.42) was spoken by Bhīṣmadeva, the grandfather of the Kurus, when he was lying on a bed of arrows at the last stage of his life. Arjuna, Kṛṣṇa and numberless friends, admirers, relatives and sages had gathered on the scene as Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira took moral and religious instructions from the dying Bhīṣma. Just as the final moment arrived for him, Bhīṣma spoke this verse while looking at Lord Kṛṣṇa.

Just as the one sun is the object of vision of many different persons, so the one partial representation of Lord Kṛṣṇa who lives in the heart of every living entity as the Paramātmā is a variously perceived object. One who comes intimately in touch with Lord Kṛṣṇa by engaging in His eternal service sees the Supersoul as the localized partial representation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Bhīṣma knew the Supersoul to be a partial expansion of Lord Kṛṣṇa, whom he understood to be the supreme, unborn transcendental form.

*seita govinda sākṣāc caitanya gosāñi  
jīva nistārite aiche dayālu āra nāi*

### Synonyms

*seita* — that; *govinda* — Govinda; *sākṣāt* — personally; *caitanya* — Lord Caitanya; *gosāñi* — Gosāñi; *jīva* — the fallen living entities; *nistārite* — to deliver; *aiche* — such; *dayālu* — a merciful Lord; *āra* — another; *nāi* — there is not.

### Translation

**That Govinda personally appears as Caitanya Gosāñi. No other Lord is as merciful in delivering the fallen souls.**

### Purport

Having described Govinda in terms of His Brahman and Paramātmā features, now the author of *Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta* advances his argument to prove that Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is the identical personality. The same Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, in the garb of a devotee of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, descended to this mortal world to reclaim the fallen human beings who had misunderstood the Personality of Godhead even after the explanation of the *Bhagavad-gītā.* In the *Bhagavad-gītā* the Personality of Godhead Śrī Kṛṣṇa directly instructed that the Supreme is a person, that the impersonal Brahman is His glowing effulgence, and that the Paramātmā is His partial representation. All men were therefore advised to follow the path of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, leaving aside all mundane “isms.” Offenders misunderstood this instruction, however, because of their poor fund of knowledge. Thus by His causeless, unlimited mercy Śrī Kṛṣṇa came again as Śrī Caitanya Gosāñi.

The author of *Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta* most emphatically stresses that Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu is Śrī Kṛṣṇa Himself. He is not an expansion of the *prakāśa* or *vilāsa* forms of Śrī Kṛṣṇa; He is the *svayaṁ-rūpa,* Govinda. Apart from the relevant scriptural evidence forwarded by Śrīla Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī, there are innumerable other scriptural statements regarding Lord Caitanya’s being the Supreme Lord Himself. The following examples may be cited:

\(1\) From the *Caitanya Upaniṣad* (5): *gauraḥ sarvātmā mahā-puruṣo mahātmā mahā-yogī tri-guṇātītaḥ sattva-rūpo bhaktiṁ loke kāśyati.* “Lord Gaura, who is the all-pervading Supersoul, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, appears as a great saint and powerful mystic who is above the three modes of nature and is the emblem of transcendental activity. He disseminates the cult of devotion throughout the world.”

\(2\) From the *Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad* (6.7 and 3.12):

*tam īśvarāṇāṁ paramaṁ maheśvaraṁ *
 *taṁ devatānāṁ paramaṁ ca daivatam  
patiṁ patīnāṁ paramaṁ parastād *
 *vidāma devaṁ bhuvaneśam īḍyam*

“O Supreme Lord, You are the Supreme Maheśvara, the worshipable Deity of all the demigods and the Supreme Lord of all lords. You are the controller of all controllers, the Personality of Godhead, the Lord of everything worshipable.”

*mahān prabhur vai puruṣaḥ* *sattvasyaiṣa pravartakaḥ  
su-nirmalām imāṁ prāptim* *īśāno jyotir avyayaḥ*

“The Supreme Personality of Godhead is Mahāprabhu, who disseminates transcendental enlightenment. Just to be in touch with Him is to be in contact with the indestructible *brahmajyoti.*”

\(3\) From the *Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad* (3.1.3):

*yadā paśyaḥ paśyate rukma-varṇaṁ *
 *kartāram īśaṁ puruṣaṁ brahma-yonim*

“One who sees that golden-colored Personality of Godhead, the Supreme Lord, the supreme actor, who is the source of the Supreme Brahman, is liberated.”

\(4\) From *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (11.5.33-34 and 7.9.38)*:*

*dhyeyaṁ sadā paribhava-ghnam abhīṣṭa-dohaṁ *
 *tīrthāspadaṁ śiva-viriñci-nutaṁ śaraṇyam  
bhṛtyārti-haṁ praṇata-pāla-bhavābdhi-potaṁ *
 *vande mahā-puruṣa te caraṇāravindam*

“We offer our respectful obeisances unto the lotus feet of Him, the Lord, upon whom one should always meditate. He destroys insults to His devotees. He removes the distresses of His devotees and satisfies their desires. He, the abode of all holy places and the shelter of all sages, is worshipable by Lord Śiva and Lord Brahmā. He is the boat of the demigods for crossing the ocean of birth and death.”

*tyaktvā sudustyaja-surepsita-rājya-lakṣmīṁ *
 *dharmiṣṭha ārya-vacasā yad agād araṇyam  
māyā-mṛgaṁ dayitayepsitam anvadhāvad *
 *vande mahā-puruṣa te caraṇāravindam*

“We offer our respectful obeisances unto the lotus feet of the Lord, upon whom one should always meditate. He left His householder life, leaving aside His eternal consort, whom even the denizens of heaven adore. He went into the forest to deliver the fallen souls, who are put into illusion by material energy.”

Prahlāda said:

*itthaṁ nṛ-tiryag-ṛṣi-deva jhaṣāvatārair *
 *lokān vibhāvayasi haṁsi jagat-pratīpān  
dharmaṁ mahā-puruṣa pāsi yugānuvṛttaṁ *
 *channaḥ kalau yad abhavas tri-yugo ’tha sa tvam*

“My Lord, You kill all the enemies of the world in Your multifarious incarnations in the families of men, animals, demigods, *ṛṣis,* aquatics and so on. Thus You illuminate the worlds with transcendental knowledge. In the Age of Kali, O Mahāpuruṣa, You sometimes appear in a covered incarnation. Therefore You are known as Tri-yuga \[one who appears in only three *yugas*\].”

\(5\) From the *Kṛṣṇa-yāmala-tantra: puṇya-kṣetre nava-dvīpe bhaviṣyāmi śacī-sutaḥ.* “I shall appear in the holy land of Navadvīpa as the son of Śacī-devī.”

\(6\) From the *Vāyu Purāṇa: kalau saṅkīrtanārambhe bhaviṣyāmi śacī-sutaḥ.* “In the Age of Kali when the *saṅkīrtana* movement is inaugurated, I shall descend as the son of Śacī-devī.”

\(7\) From the *Brahma-yāmala-tantra:*

*atha vāhaṁ dharādhāme* *bhūtvā mad-bhakta-rūpa-dhṛk  
māyāyāṁ ca bhaviṣyāmi* *kalau saṅkīrtanāgame*

“Sometimes I personally appear on the surface of the world in the garb of a devotee. Specifically, I appear as the son of Śacī in Kali-yuga to start the *saṅkīrtana* movement.”

\(8\) From the *Ananta-saṁhitā:*

*ya eva bhagavān kṛṣṇo* *rādhikā-prāṇa-vallabhaḥ  
sṛṣṭy ādau sa jagan-nātho* *gaura āsīn maheśvari*

“The Supreme Person, Śrī Kṛṣṇa Himself, who is the life of Śrī Rādhārāṇī and is the Lord of the universe in creation, maintenance and annihilation, appears as Gaura, O Maheśvarī.”

Therefore Nārāyaṇa is eternally existing. Everything that exists now or will be created in the future is nothing but Nārāyaṇa, who is the unadulterated Deity. There is only Nārāyaṇa and nothing else.”

“O King, know Him who is causeless and yet is the cause of creation, maintenance and annihilation. He exists in the three states of consciousness — namely waking, dreaming and deep sleep — as well as beyond them. He enlivens the body, the senses, the breath of life, and the heart, and thus they move. Know Him to be supreme.”

### Verse text

*bhakti-yoge bhakta pāya yāṅhāra darśana  
sūrya yena savigraha dekhe deva-gaṇa*

### Synonyms

*bhakti*-*yoge* — by devotional service; *bhakta* — the devotee; *pāya* — obtains; *yāṅhāra* — whose; *darśana* — sight; *sūrya* — the sun-god; *yena* — like; *sa*-*vigraha* — with form; *dekhe* — they see; *deva*-*gaṇa* — the denizens of heaven.

### Translation

**Through their service, devotees see that Personality of Godhead, just as the denizens of heaven see the personality of the sun.**

### Purport

The Supreme Personality of Godhead has His eternal form, which cannot be seen by material eyes or mental speculation. Only by transcendental devotional service can one understand the transcendental form of the Lord. The comparison is made here to the qualifications for viewing the personal features of the sun-god. The sun-god is a person who, although not visible to our eyes, is seen from the higher planets by the demigods, whose eyes are suitable for seeing through the glaring sunshine that surrounds him. Every planet has its own atmosphere according to the influence of the arrangement of material nature. It is therefore necessary to have a particular type of bodily construction to reach a particular planet. The inhabitants of earth may be able to reach the moon, but the inhabitants of heaven can reach even the fiery sphere called the sun. What is impossible for man on earth is easy for the demigods in heaven because of their different bodies. Similarly, to see the Supreme Lord one must have the spiritual eyes of devotional service. The Personality of Godhead is unapproachable by those who are habituated to speculation about the Absolute Truth in terms of experimental scientific thought, without reference to the transcendental vibration. The ascending approach to the Absolute Truth ends in the realization of impersonal Brahman and the localized Paramātmā but not the Supreme Transcendental Personality.

**Those who walk the paths of knowledge and yoga worship only Him, for it is Him they perceive as the impersonal Brahman and localized Paramātmā.**

### Purport

Those who are fond of mental speculation (*jñāna-mārga*) or want to meditate in mystic *yoga* to find the Absolute Truth must approach the impersonal effulgence of the Lord and His partial representation respectively. Such persons cannot realize the eternal form of the Lord.

### Purport

Nārāyaṇa is identical to Śrī Kṛṣṇa. They are in fact the same person manifested differently, like a high court judge who is differently situated in his office and at home. As Nārāyaṇa the Lord is manifested with four hands, but as Kṛṣṇa He is manifested with two hands.

They are absolute and are not creations of māyā.”**

### Purport

This statement, which is from *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (10.14.14), was spoken by Lord Brahmā in his prayers to Lord Kṛṣṇa after the Lord had defeated him by displaying His mystic powers. Brahmā had tried to test Lord Kṛṣṇa to see if He were really the Supreme Personality of Godhead playing as a cowherd boy. Brahmā stole all the other boys and their calves from the pasturing grounds, but when he returned to the pastures he saw that all the boys and calves were still there, for Lord Kṛṣṇa had created them all again. When Brahmā saw this mystic power of Lord Kṛṣṇa’s, he admitted defeat and offered prayers to the Lord, addressing Him as the proprietor and seer of everything in the creation and as the Supersoul who is within each and every living entity and is dear to all. That Lord Kṛṣṇa is Nārāyaṇa, the father of Brahmā, because Lord Kṛṣṇa’s plenary expansion Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu, after placing Himself on the Garbha Ocean, created Brahmā from His own body. Mahā-Viṣṇu in the Causal Ocean and Kṣīrodakaśāyī Viṣṇu, the Supersoul in everyone’s heart, are also transcendental expansions of the Supreme Truth.

### Translation

**“All the living beings within the material and spiritual worlds are ultimately born of You, for You are the Supersoul of them all.**

### Purport

The cosmic manifestation is generated by the interaction of the three modes of material nature. The transcendental world has no such material modes, although it is nevertheless full of spiritual variegatedness. In that spiritual world there are also innumerable living entities, who are eternally liberated souls engaged in transcendental loving service to Lord Kṛṣṇa. The conditioned souls, who remain within the material cosmic creation, are subjected to the threefold miseries and pangs of material nature. They exist in different species of life because they are eternally averse to transcendental loving devotion to the Supreme Lord.

Saṅkarṣaṇa is the original source of all living entities because they are all expansions of His marginal potency. Some of them are conditioned by material nature, whereas others are under the protection of the spiritual nature. The material nature is a conditional manifestation of spiritual nature, just as smoke is a conditional stage of fire. Smoke is dependent on fire, but in a blazing fire there is no place for smoke. Smoke disturbs, but fire serves. The serving spirit of the residents of the transcendental world is displayed in five varieties of relationships with the Supreme Lord, who is the central enjoyer. In the material world everyone is a self-centered enjoyer of mundane happiness and distress. One considers himself the lord of everything and tries to enjoy the illusory energy, but he is not successful because he is not independent: he is but a minute particle of the energy of Lord Saṅkarṣaṇa. All living beings exist under the control of the Supreme Lord, who is therefore called Nārāyaṇa.

### Synonyms

*pṛthvī* — the earth; *yaiche* — just as; *ghaṭa* — of earthen pots; *kulera* — of the multitude; *kāraṇa* — the cause; *āśraya* — the shelter; *jīvera* — of the living beings; *nidāna* — root cause; *tumi* — You; *tumi* — You; *sarva*-*āśraya* — shelter of all.

### Translation

**“As the earth is the original cause and shelter of all pots made of earth, so You are the ultimate cause and shelter of all living beings.**

### Purport

As the vast earth is the source for the ingredients of all earthen pots, so the Supreme Soul is the source for the complete substance of all individual living entities. The cause of all causes, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the cause of the living entities. This is confirmed in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (7.10), where the Lord says, *bījaṁ māṁ sarva-bhūtānām* (“I am the seed of all living entities”), and in the *Upaniṣads* (*Kaṭha Up.* 2.2.13), which say, *nityo nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānām* (“the Lord is the supreme leader among all the eternal living beings”).

The Lord is the reservoir of all cosmic manifestation, animate and inanimate. The advocates of Viśiṣṭādvaita-vāda philosophy explain the *Vedānta-sūtra* by saying that although the living entity has two kinds of bodies — subtle (consisting of mind, intelligence and false ego) and gross (consisting of the five basic elements) — and although he thus lives in three bodily dimensions (gross, subtle and spiritual), he is nevertheless a spiritual soul. Similarly, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who emanates the material and spiritual worlds, is the Supreme Spirit. As an individual spirit soul is almost identical to his gross and subtle bodies, so the Supreme Lord is almost identical to the material and spiritual worlds. The material world, full of conditioned souls trying to lord it over matter, is a manifestation of the external energy of the Supreme Lord, and the spiritual world, full of perfect servitors of the Lord, is a manifestation of His internal energy. Since all living entities are minute sparks of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, He is the Supreme Soul in both the material and spiritual worlds. The Vaiṣṇavas following Lord Caitanya stress the doctrine of *acintya-bhedābheda-tattva,* which states that the Supreme Lord, being the cause and effect of everything, is inconceivably, simultaneously one with His manifestations of energy and different from them.

The controlling Deities of the living beings in the mundane worlds are the three *puruṣa-avatāras.* But the potent energy displayed by Śrī Kṛṣṇa is far more extensive than that of the *puruṣas.* Śrī Kṛṣṇa is therefore the original father and Lord who protects all creative manifestations through His various plenary portions. Since He sustains even the shelters of the collective living beings, there is no doubt that Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the original Nārāyaṇa.

Śrī Kṛṣṇa knows what the living beings have done for hundreds and thousands of past births, and He sees what they are doing now; therefore He knows the results of their present actions that will fructify in the future. As stated in the *Bhagavad-gītā,* the entire cosmic situation is created as soon as He glances over the material energy. Nothing can exist without His superintendence. Since He sees even the abode where the collective living beings rest, He is the original Nārāyaṇa.

### Translation

**“Superficially we see that these puruṣas have a relationship with māyā, but above them, in the fourth dimension, is Lord Kṛṣṇa, who has no contact with the material energy.**

### Purport

The three *puruṣas* — Kāraṇodakaśāyī Viṣṇu, Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu and Kṣīrodakaśāyī Viṣṇu — all have a relationship with the material energy, called *māyā,* because through *māyā* They create the material cosmos. These three *puruṣas,* who lie on the Kāraṇa, Garbha and Kṣīra oceans respectively, are the Supersoul of everything that be: Kāraṇodakaśāyī Viṣṇu is the Supersoul of the collective universes, Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu is the Supersoul of the collective living beings, and Kṣīrodakaśāyī Viṣṇu is the Supersoul of all individual living entities. Because all of Them are somehow attracted to the affairs of the material energy, They can be said to have some affection for *māyā.* But the transcendental position of Śrī Kṛṣṇa Himself is not even slightly tinged by *māyā.* His transcendental state is called *turīya,* or the fourth-dimensional stage.

### Translation

**“ ‘In the material world the Lord is designated as virāṭ, hiraṇyagarbha and kāraṇa. But beyond these three designations, the Lord is ultimately in the fourth dimension.’**

### Purport

*Virāṭ* (the phenomenal manifestation of the Supreme Whole), *hiraṇyagarbha* (the numinous soul of everything), and *kāraṇa* (the cause, or causal nature) are all but designations of the *puruṣas,* who are responsible for material creation. The transcendental position surpasses these designations and is therefore called the position of the fourth dimension. This is a quotation from Śrīdhara Svāmī’s commentary on the Eleventh Canto, fifteenth chapter, verse 16, of *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.*

### Translation

**“ ‘This is the opulence of the Lord: Although situated in the material nature, He is never affected by the modes of nature. Similarly, those who have surrendered to Him and fixed their intelligence upon Him are not influenced by the modes of nature.’**

### Purport

This text is from *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (1.11.38). Those who have taken shelter of the lotus feet of the Personality of Godhead do not identify with the material world, even while living in it. Pure devotees may deal with the three modes of material nature, but because of their transcendental intelligence in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, they are not influenced by the material qualities. The spell of material activities does not attract such devotees. Therefore, the Supreme Lord and His devotees acting under Him are always free from material contamination.

Brahmā has confirmed that Lord Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme, the source of the three manifestations known as Kṣīrodakaśāyī Viṣṇu, Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu and Kāraṇodakaśāyī Viṣṇu (Mahā-Viṣṇu). For His pastimes, Lord Kṛṣṇa has four original manifestations — namely Vāsudeva, Saṅkarṣaṇa, Pradyumna and Aniruddha. The first *puruṣa-avatāra,* Mahā-Viṣṇu in the Causal Ocean, who is the creator of the aggregate material energy, is an expansion of Saṅkarṣaṇa; the second *puruṣa,* Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu, is an expansion of Pradyumna; and the third *puruṣa,* Kṣīrodakaśāyī Viṣṇu, is an expansion of Aniruddha. All these are within the category of manifestations of Nārāyaṇa, who is a manifestation of Śrī Kṛṣṇa.

### Purport

In the verse from *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* cited above (*Bhāg.* 1.2.11), the principal word, *bhagavān,* indicates the Personality of Godhead, and Brahman and Paramātmā are concomitants deduced from the Absolute Personality, as a government and its ministers are deductions from the supreme executive head. In other words, the principal truth is exhibited in three different phases. The Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead Śrī Kṛṣṇa (Bhagavān), is also known as Brahman and Paramātmā, although all these features are identical.

### Translation

**“All these incarnations of Godhead are either plenary portions or parts of the plenary portions of the puruṣa-avatāras. But Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself. In every age He protects the world through His different features when the world is disturbed by the enemies of Indra.”**

### Purport

This statement of *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (1.3.28) definitely negates the concept that Śrī Kṛṣṇa is an *avatāra* of Viṣṇu or Nārāyaṇa. Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the original Personality of Godhead, the supreme cause of all causes. This verse clearly indicates that incarnations of the Personality of Godhead such as Śrī Rāma, Nṛsiṁha and Varāha all undoubtedly belong to the Viṣṇu group, but all of Them are either plenary portions or portions of plenary portions of the original Personality of Godhead, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa.

### Translation

**“Mistakes, illusions, cheating and defective perception do not occur in the sayings of the authoritative sages.**

### Purport

*Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* has listed the *avatāras,* the plenary expansions of the *puruṣa,* and Lord Kṛṣṇa appears among them. But the *Bhāgavatam* further explains Lord Kṛṣṇa’s specific position as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Since Lord Kṛṣṇa is the original Personality of Godhead, reason and argument establish that His position is always supreme.

Had Kṛṣṇa been a plenary expansion of Nārāyaṇa, the original verse would have been differently composed; indeed, its order would have been reversed. But there cannot be mistakes, illusion, cheating or imperfect perception in the words of liberated sages. Therefore there is no mistake in this statement that Lord Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Sanskrit statements of *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* are all transcendental sounds. Śrīla Vyāsadeva revealed these statements after perfect realization, and therefore they are perfect, for liberated sages like Vyāsadeva never commit errors in their rhetorical arrangements. Unless one accepts this fact, there is no use in trying to obtain help from the revealed scriptures.

*Bhrama* refers to false knowledge or mistakes, such as accepting a rope as a snake or an oyster shell as gold. *Pramāda* refers to inattention or misunderstanding of reality, and *vipralipsā* is the cheating propensity. *Karaṇāpāṭava* refers to imperfectness of the material senses. There are many examples of such imperfection. The eyes cannot see that which is very distant or very small. One cannot even see his own eyelid, which is the closest thing to his eye, and if one is disturbed by a disease like jaundice, he sees everything to be yellow. Similarly, the ears cannot hear distant sounds. Since the Personality of Godhead and His plenary portions and self-realized devotees are all transcendentally situated, they cannot be misled by such deficiencies.

### Translation

**“When from one candle many others are lit, I consider that one the original.**

### Purport

The *Brahma-saṁhitā,* chapter five, verse 46, states that the *viṣṇu-tattva,* or the principle of the Absolute Personality of Godhead, is like a lamp because the expansions equal their origin in all respects. A burning lamp can light innumerable other lamps, and although they will not be inferior, still the lamp from which the others are lit must be considered the original. Similarly, the Supreme Personality of Godhead expands Himself in the plenary forms of the *viṣṇu-tattva,* and although they are equally powerful, the original powerful Personality of Godhead is considered the source. This example also explains the appearance of qualitative incarnations like Lord Śiva and Lord Brahmā. According to Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī, *śambhos tu tamo-’dhiṣṭhānatvāt kajjalamaya-sūkṣma-dīpa-śikhā-sthānīyasya na tathā sāmyam:* “The *śambhu-tattva,* or the principle of Lord Śiva, is like a lamp covered with carbon because of his being in charge of the mode of ignorance. The illumination from such a lamp is very minute. Therefore the power of Lord Śiva cannot compare to that of the Viṣṇu principle.”

The tenth item is the shelter of all the others. To distinguish this ultimate shelter from the other nine subjects, the mahājanas have described these nine, directly or indirectly, through prayers or direct explanations.’**

### Purport

These verses from *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (2.10.1-2) list the ten subject matters dealt with in the text of the *Bhāgavatam.* Of these, the tenth is the substance, and the other nine are categories derived from the substance. These ten subjects are listed as follows:

\(1\) *Sarga:* the first creation by Viṣṇu, the bringing forth of the five gross material elements, the five objects of sense perception, the ten senses, the mind, the intelligence, the false ego and the total material energy, or universal form.

\(2\) *Visarga:* the secondary creation, or the work of Brahmā in producing the moving and unmoving bodies in the universe (*brahmāṇḍa*)*.*

\(3\) *Sthāna:* the maintenance of the universe by the Personality of Godhead, Viṣṇu. Viṣṇu’s function is more important and His glory greater than Brahmā’s and Lord Śiva’s, for although Brahmā is the creator and Lord Śiva the destroyer, Viṣṇu is the maintainer.

\(4\) *Poṣaṇa:* special care and protection for devotees by the Lord. As a king maintains his kingdom and subjects but nevertheless gives special attention to the members of his family, so the Personality of Godhead gives special care to His devotees who are souls completely surrendered to Him.

\(5\) *Ūti:* the urge for creation, or initiative power, that is the cause of all inventions, according to the necessities of time, space and objects.

\(6\) *Manv-antara:* the periods controlled by the Manus, who teach regulative principles for living beings who desire to achieve perfection in human life. The rules of Manu, as described in the *Manu-saṁhitā,* guide the way to such perfection.

\(7\) *Īśānukathā:* scriptural information regarding the Personality of Godhead, His incarnations on earth and the activities of His devotees. Scriptures dealing with these subjects are essential for progressive human life.

\(8\) *Nirodha:* the winding up of all energies employed in creation. Such potencies are emanations from the Personality of Godhead who eternally lies in the Kāraṇa Ocean. The cosmic creations, manifested with His breath, are again dissolved in due course.

\(9\) *Mukti:* liberation of the conditioned souls encaged by the gross and subtle coverings of body and mind. When freed from all material affection, the soul, giving up the gross and subtle material bodies, can attain the spiritual sky in his original spiritual body and engage in transcendental loving service to the Lord in Vaikuṇṭhaloka or Kṛṣṇaloka. When the soul is situated in his original constitutional position of existence, he is said to be liberated. It is possible to engage in transcendental loving service to the Lord and become *jīvan-mukta,* a liberated soul, even while in the material body.

\(10\) *Āśraya:* the Transcendence, the summum bonum, from whom everything emanates, upon whom everything rests, and in whom everything merges after annihilation. He is the source and support of all. The *āśraya* is also called the Supreme Brahman, as in the *Vedānta-sūtra* (*athāto brahma-jijñāsā, janmādy asya yataḥ*)*. Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* especially describes this Supreme Brahman as the *āśraya.* Śrī Kṛṣṇa is this *āśraya,* and therefore the greatest necessity of life is to study the science of Kṛṣṇa.

*Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* accepts Śrī Kṛṣṇa as the shelter of all manifestations because Lord Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the ultimate source of everything, the supreme goal of all.

Two different principles are to be considered herein — namely *āśraya,* the object providing shelter, and *āśrita,* the dependents requiring shelter. The *āśrita* exist under the original principle, the *āśraya.* The first nine categories, described in the first nine cantos of *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,* from creation to liberation — including the *puruṣa-avatāras,* the incarnations, the marginal energy, or living entities, and the external energy, or material world — are all *āśrita.* The prayers of *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,* however, aim for the *āśraya-tattva,* the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Śrī Kṛṣṇa. The great souls expert in describing *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* have very diligently delineated the other nine categories, sometimes by direct narrations and sometimes by indirect narrations such as stories. The real purpose of doing this is to know perfectly the Absolute Transcendence, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, for the entire creation, both material and spiritual, rests on the body of Śrī Kṛṣṇa.

Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī states in his *Bhagavat-sandarbha* (16) that by His potencies, which act in natural sequences beyond the scope of the speculative human mind, the Supreme Transcendence, the summum bonum, eternally and simultaneously exists in four transcendental features: His personality, His impersonal effulgence, particles of His potency (the living beings), and the principal cause of all causes. The Supreme Whole is compared to the sun, which also exists in four features, namely the personality of the sun-god, the glare of his glowing sphere, the sun rays inside the sun planet, and the sun’s reflections in many other objects. The ambition to corroborate the existence of the transcendental Absolute Truth by limited conjectural endeavors cannot be fulfilled, because He is beyond the scope of our limited speculative minds. In an honest search for truth, we must admit that His powers are inconceivable to our tiny brains. The exploration of space has demanded the work of the greatest scientists of the world, yet there are countless problems regarding even fundamental knowledge of the material creation that bewilder scientists who confront them. Such material knowledge is far removed from the spiritual nature, and therefore the acts and arrangements of the Absolute Truth are, beyond all doubts, inconceivable.

The primary potencies of the Absolute Truth are mentioned to be three: internal, external and marginal. By the acts of His internal potency, the Personality of Godhead in His original form exhibits the spiritual cosmic manifestations known as the Vaikuṇṭhalokas, which exist eternally, even after the destruction of the material cosmic manifestation. By His marginal potency the Lord expands Himself as living beings who are part of Him, just as the sun distributes its rays in all directions. By His external potency the Lord manifests the material creation, just as the sun with its rays creates fog. The material creation is but a perverse-reflection of the eternal Vaikuṇṭha nature.

These three energies of the Absolute Truth are also described in the *Viṣṇu Purāṇa,* where it is said that the living being is equal in quality to the internal potency, whereas the external potency is indirectly controlled by the chief cause of all causes. *Māyā,* the illusory energy, misleads a living being as fog misleads a pedestrian by blocking off the light of the sun. Although the potency of *māyā* is inferior in quality to the marginal potency, which consists of the living beings, who are part and parcel of the Lord, it nevertheless has the power to control the living beings, just as fog can block the actions of a certain portion of the sun’s rays although it cannot cover the sun. The living beings covered by the illusory energy evolve in different species of life, with bodies ranging from that of an insignificant ant to that of Brahmā, the constructor of the cosmos. The *pradhāna,* the chief cause of all causes in the impersonal vision, is none other than the Supreme Lord, whom one can see face to face in the internal potency. He takes the material all-pervasive form by His inconceivable power. Although all three potencies — namely internal, external and marginal — are essentially one in the ultimate issue, they are different in action, like electric energy, which can produce both cold and heat under different conditions. The external and marginal potencies are so called under various conditions, but in the original, internal potencies there are no such conditions, nor is it possible for the conditions of the external potency to exist in the marginal, or vice versa. One who is able to understand the intricacies of all these energies of the Supreme Lord can no longer remain an empiric impersonalist under the influence of a poor fund of knowledge.

### Purport

Now the author of *Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta* turns to a description of the Personality of Godhead Kṛṣṇa in His innumerable expansions. The Lord primarily expands Himself in two categories, namely *prābhava* and *vaibhava.* The *prābhava* forms are fully potent like Śrī Kṛṣṇa, and the *vaibhava* forms are partially potent. The *prābhava* forms are manifested in relation with potencies, but the *vaibhava* forms are manifested in relation with excellences. The potent *prābhava* manifestations are also of two varieties: temporary and eternal. The Mohinī, Haṁsa and Śukla forms are manifested only temporarily, in terms of a particular age. Among the other *prābhavas,* who are not very famous according to the material estimation, are Dhanvantari, Ṛṣabha, Vyāsa, Dattātreya and Kapila. Among the *vaibhava-prakāśa* forms are Kūrma, Matsya, Nara-Nārāyaṇa, Varāha, Hayagrīva, Pṛśnigarbha, Baladeva, Yajña, Vibhu, Satyasena, Hari, Vaikuṇṭha, Ajita, Vāmana, Sārvabhauma, Ṛṣabha, Viṣvaksena, Dharmasetu, Sudhāmā, Yogeśvara and Bṛhadbhānu.

Childhood and boyhood are two special features of the Personality of Godhead Śrī Kṛṣṇa, but His permanent feature is His eternal form as an adolescent youth. The original Personality of Godhead Śrī Kṛṣṇa is always worshiped in this eternal adolescent form.

The material cosmos displays the external energy, in which the conditioned living beings are provided all liberty to go back to the Personality of Godhead after leaving the material tabernacle.

### Translation

**A sincere student should not neglect the discussion of such conclusions, considering them controversial, for such discussions strengthen the mind. Thus one’s mind becomes attached to Śrī Kṛṣṇa.**

### Purport

There are many students who, in spite of reading the *Bhagavad-gītā,* misunderstand Kṛṣṇa because of imperfect knowledge and conclude Him to be an ordinary historical personality. This one must not do. One should be particularly careful to understand the truth about Kṛṣṇa. If because of laziness one does not come to know Kṛṣṇa conclusively, one will be misguided about the cult of devotion, like those who declare themselves advanced devotees and imitate the transcendental symptoms sometimes observed in liberated souls. Although the use of thoughts and arguments is a most suitable process for inducing an uninitiated person to become a devotee, neophytes in devotional service must always alertly understand Kṛṣṇa through the vision of the revealed scriptures, the bona fide devotees and the spiritual master. Unless one hears about Śrī Kṛṣṇa from such authorities, one cannot make advancement in devotion to Śrī Kṛṣṇa. The revealed scriptures mention nine means of attaining devotional service, of which the first and foremost is hearing from authority. The seed of devotion cannot sprout unless watered by the process of hearing and chanting. One should submissively receive the transcendental messages from spiritually advanced sources and chant the very same messages for one’s own benefit as well as the benefit of one’s audience.

When Brahmā described the situation of pure devotees freed from the culture of empiric philosophy and fruitive actions, he recommended the process of hearing from persons who are on the path of devotion. Following in the footsteps of such liberated souls, who are able to vibrate real transcendental sound, can lead one to the highest stage of devotion, and thus one can become a *mahā-bhāgavata.* From the teachings of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu to Sanātana Gosvāmī (*Madhya* 22.65) we learn:

*śāstra-yuktye sunipuṇa, dṛḍha-śraddhā yāṅra  
‘uttama-adhikārī’ sei tāraye saṁsāra*

“A person who is expert in understanding the conclusion of the revealed scriptures and who fully surrenders to the cause of the Lord is actually able to deliver others from the clutches of material existence.” Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī, in his *Upadeśāmṛta* (3), advises that to make rapid advancement in the cult of devotional service one should be very active and should persevere in executing the duties specified in the revealed scriptures and confirmed by the spiritual master. Accepting the path of liberated souls and the association of pure devotees enriches such activities.

Imitation devotees, who wish to advertise themselves as elevated Vaiṣṇavas and who therefore imitate the previous *ācāryas* but do not follow them in principle, are condemned in the words of *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (2.3.24) as stone-hearted. Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura has commented on their stone-hearted condition as follows: *bahir aśru-pulakayoḥ sator api yad dhṛdayaṁ na vikriyeta tad aśma-sāram iti kaniṣṭhādhikāriṇām eva aśru-pulakādi-mattve ’pi aśma-sāra-hṛdayatayā nindaiṣā.* “Those who shed tears by practice but whose hearts have not changed are to be known as stone-hearted devotees of the lowest grade. Their imitation crying, induced by artificial practice, is always condemned.” The desired change of heart referred to above is visible in the reluctance to do anything not congenial to the devotional way. To create such a change of heart, conclusive discussion about Śrī Kṛṣṇa and His potencies is absolutely necessary. False devotees may think that simply shedding tears will lead one to the transcendental plane, even if one has not had a factual change in heart, but such a practice is useless if there is no transcendental realization. False devotees, lacking the conclusion of transcendental knowledge, think that artificially shedding tears will deliver them. Similarly, other false devotees think that studying books of the previous *ācāryas* is unadvisable, like studying dry empiric philosophies. But Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī, following the previous *ācāryas,* has inculcated the conclusions of the scriptures in the six theses called the *Ṣaṭ-sandarbhas.* False devotees who have very little knowledge of such conclusions fail to achieve pure devotion for want of zeal in accepting the favorable directions for devotional service given by self-realized devotees. Such false devotees are like impersonalists, who also consider devotional service no better than ordinary fruitive actions.
