CHAPTER TWELVE

Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura gives a summary of the twelfth chapter in his *Amṛta-pravāha-bhāṣya.* The twelfth chapter describes the followers of Advaita Prabhu, among whom the followers of Acyutānanda, the son of Advaita Ācārya, are understood to be the pure followers who received the cream of the philosophy Śrī Advaita Ācārya enunciated. Other so-called descendants and followers of Advaita Ācārya are not to be recognized. This chapter also includes narrations concerning the son of Advaita Ācārya named Gopāla Miśra and Advaita Ācārya’s servant named Kamalākānta Viśvāsa. In his early life Gopāla fainted during the cleansing of the Guṇḍicā-mandira at Jagannātha Purī and thus became a recipient of the mercy of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. The story of Kamalākānta Viśvāsa concerns his borrowing three hundred rupees from Pratāparudra Mahārāja to clear a debt of Advaita Ācārya’s, for which Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu chastised him when He came to know of it. Kamalākānta Viśvāsa was then purified by the request of Śrī Advaita Ācārya. After describing the descendants of Advaita Ācārya, the chapter concludes by describing the followers of Gadādhara Paṇḍita Gosvāmī.

### Translation

**At first all the followers of Advaita Ācārya shared a single opinion. But later they followed two different opinions, as ordained by providence.**

### Purport

The words *daivera kāraṇa* indicate that by dint of providence, or by God’s will, the followers of Advaita Ācārya divided into two parties. Such disagreement among the disciples of one *ācārya* is also found among the members of the Gauḍīya Maṭha. In the beginning, during the presence of Oṁ Viṣṇupāda Paramahaṁsa Parivrājakācārya Aṣṭottara-śata Śrī Śrīmad Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura Prabhupāda, all the disciples worked in agreement; but just after his disappearance, they disagreed. One party strictly followed the instructions of Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura, but another group created their own concoction about executing his desires. Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura, at the time of his departure, requested all his disciples to form a governing body and conduct missionary activities cooperatively. He did not instruct a particular man to become the next *ācārya.* But just after his passing away, his leading secretaries made plans, without authority, to occupy the post of *ācārya,* and they split into two factions over who the next *ācārya* would be. Consequently, both factions were *asāra,* or useless, because they had no authority, having disobeyed the order of the spiritual master. Despite the spiritual master’s order to form a governing body and execute the missionary activities of the Gauḍīya Maṭha, the two unauthorized factions began litigation that is still going on after forty years with no decision.

Therefore, we do not belong to any faction. But because the two parties, busy dividing the material assets of the Gauḍīya Maṭha institution, stopped the preaching work, we took up the mission of Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura and Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura to preach the cult of Caitanya Mahāprabhu all over the world, under the protection of all the predecessor *ācāryas,* and we find that our humble attempt has been successful. We followed the principles especially explained by Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura in his commentary on the *Bhagavad-gītā* verse beginning *vyavasāyātmikā buddhir ekeha kuru-nandana.* According to this instruction of Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura, it is the duty of a disciple to follow strictly the orders of his spiritual master. The secret of success in advancement in spiritual life is the firm faith of the disciple in the orders of his spiritual master. The *Vedas* confirm this:

*yasya deve parā bhaktir* *yathā deve tathā gurau  
tasyaite kathitā hy arthāḥ* *prakāśante mahātmanaḥ*

“To one who has staunch faith in the words of the spiritual master and the words of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the secret of success in Vedic knowledge is revealed.” The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is being propagated according to this principle, and therefore our preaching work is going on successfully, in spite of the many impediments offered by antagonistic demons, because we are getting positive help from our previous *ācāryas.* One must judge every action by its result. The members of the self-appointed *ācārya’s* party who occupied the property of the Gauḍīya Maṭha are satisfied, but they could make no progress in preaching. Therefore by the result of their actions one should know that they are *asāra,* or useless, whereas the success of the ISKCON party, the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, which strictly follows *guru* and Gaurāṅga, is increasing daily all over the world. Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura wanted to print as many books as possible and distribute them all over the world. We have tried our best in this connection, and we are getting results beyond our expectations.

### Verse text

*keha ta’ ācārya ājñāya, keha ta’ svatantra  
sva-mata kalpanā kare daiva-paratantra*

### Synonyms

*keha* *ta’* — some; *ācārya* — the spiritual master; *ājñāya* — upon His order; *keha* *ta’* — some; *sva*-*tantra* — independently; *sva*-*mata* — their own opinions; *kalpanā* *kare* — they concoct; *daiva*-*paratantra* — under the spell of *māyā*.

### Translation

**Some of the disciples strictly accepted the orders of the ācārya, and others deviated, independently concocting their own opinions under the spell of daivī-māyā.**

### Purport

This verse describes the beginning of a schism. When disciples do not stick to the principle of accepting the order of their spiritual master, immediately there are two opinions. Any opinion different from the opinion of the spiritual master is useless. One cannot infiltrate materially concocted ideas into spiritual advancement. That is deviation. There is no scope for adjusting spiritual advancement to material ideas.

### Verse text

*dhānya-rāśi māpe yaiche pātnā sahite  
paścāte pātnā uḍāñā saṁskāra karite*

### Synonyms

### Translation

**Paddy is mixed with straw at first, and one must fan it to separate the paddy from the straw.**

### Purport

This example given by Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī is very appropriate. In the case of the Gauḍīya Maṭha members, one can apply a similar process. There are many disciples of Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura, but to judge who is actually his disciple, to divide the useful from the useless, one must measure the activities of such disciples in executing the will of the spiritual master. Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura tried his best to spread the cult of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu to countries outside India. When he was present he patronized the disciples to go outside India to preach the cult of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, but they were unsuccessful because within their minds they were not actually serious about preaching His cult in foreign countries; they simply wanted to take credit for having gone to foreign lands and utilize this recognition in India by advertising themselves as repatriated preachers. Many *svāmīs* have adopted this hypocritical means of preaching for the last eighty years or more, but no one could preach the real cult of Kṛṣṇa consciousness all over the world. They merely came back to India falsely advertising that they had converted all the foreigners to the ideas of Vedānta or Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and then they collected funds in India and lived satisfied lives of material comfort. As one fans paddy to separate the real paddy from useless straw, by accepting the criterion recommended by Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī one can very easily understand who is a genuine world-preacher and who is useless.

### Purport

commenting on verses 13 through 17, Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura gives an extensive description of the descendants of Advaita Ācārya. The *Caitanya-bhāgavata, Antya-khaṇḍa,* chapter one, states that Acyutānanda was the eldest son of Advaita Ācārya. The Sanskrit book *Advaita-carita* states, “Advaita Ācārya Prabhu had three sons who were devotees of Lord Caitanya. Their names were Acyuta, Kṛṣṇa Miśra and Gopāla dāsa, and they were all born of the womb of His wife, Sītādevī. Advaita Ācārya also had three more sons, whose names were Balarāma, Svarūpa and Jagadīśa. Thus there were six sons of Advaita Ācārya.” Among the six sons, three were strict followers of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and of these three, Acyutānanda was the eldest.

Advaita Prabhu married in the beginning of the fifteenth century Śakābda (late fifteenth century A.D.)*.* When Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu wanted to visit the village of Rāmakeli while going from Jagannātha Purī to Vṛndāvana during the Śakābda years 1433 and 1434 (A.D. 1511 and 1512), Acyutānanda was only five years old. The *Caitanya-bhāgavata, Antya-khaṇḍa,* fourth chapter, describes Acyutānanda at that time as *pañca-varṣa vayasa madhura digambara,* “only five years old and standing naked.” Therefore it is to be concluded that Acyutānanda was born sometime in the year 1428 (A.D. 1506). Before the birth of Acyutānanda, Advaita Prabhu’s wife, Sītādevī, came to see Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu at His birth. Thus it is not impossible that she had the other three sons by Advaita within the twenty-one years between 1407 and 1428 Śakābda (A.D. 1486 and 1507)*.* In an unauthorized book of the name *Sītādvaita-carita,* published in Bengali in the unauthorized newspaper *Nityānanda-dāyinī* in 1792 Śakābda (A.D. 1870), it is mentioned that Acyutānanda was a class friend of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. According to the *Caitanya-bhāgavata,* this statement is not at all valid. When Caitanya Mahāprabhu accepted the renounced order of *sannyāsa* in the year 1431 Śakābda (A.D. 1509), He came to the house of Advaita Prabhu at Śāntipura*.* At that time, as stated in the *Caitanya-bhāgavata, Antya-khaṇḍa,* chapter one, Acyutānanda was only three years old. The *Caitanya-bhāgavata* further states that the naked child, the son of Advaita Prabhu, immediately came and fell down at the lotus feet of Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. The Lord immediately took him on His lap, although he was not very clean, having dust all over his body. Lord Caitanya said, “My dear Acyuta, Advaita Ācārya is My father, and thus we are brothers.”

Before Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu exhibited His spiritual forms during His residence at Navadvīpa, He asked Śrī Rāma Paṇḍita, Śrīvāsa Ṭhākura’s brother, to go to Śāntipura and bring back Advaita Ācārya. Acyutānanda joined his father at that time. It is said, *advaitera tanaya ‘acyutānanda’ nāma/ parama-bālaka, seho kānde avirāma.* Acyutānanda also joined in crying in transcendental bliss. Again, when Lord Caitanya beat Advaita Ācārya for explaining *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* from an impersonalist viewpoint opposed to the principles of *bhakti-yoga,* Acyutānanda was also present. Therefore all these incidents must have occurred only two or three years before Lord Caitanya accepted the *sannyāsa* order. As mentioned above, in the *Caitanya-bhāgavata, Antya-khaṇḍa,* chapter one, it is stated that Acyutānanda, the son of Advaita Ācārya, offered his obeisances to the Lord. Therefore it should be concluded that from the very beginning of his life Acyutānanda was a great devotee of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

There is no information that Acyutānanda ever married, but he is described as the biggest branch of the Advaita Ācārya family. From a book named *Śākhā-nirṇayāmṛta* it is understood that Acyutānanda was a disciple of Gadādhara Paṇḍita and that he took shelter of Lord Caitanya in Jagannātha Purī and engaged in devotional service. The *Caitanya-caritāmṛta, Ādi-līlā,* chapter ten, states that Acyutānanda, the son of Advaita Ācārya, lived in Jagannātha Purī, taking shelter of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Gadādhara Paṇḍita, in the last years of his life, also lived with Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu at Jagannātha Purī. There is no doubt, therefore, that Acyutānanda was a disciple of Paṇḍita Gadādhara. In the accounts of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s dancing in front of the car during the Ratha-yātrā festival, Acyutānanda’s name is to be found many times. It is stated that in the party of Advaita Ācārya from Śāntipura, Acyutānanda was dancing and others were singing. At that time the boy was only six years old. text 87 of the *Gaura-gaṇoddeśa-dīpikā,* compiled by Śrī Kavi-karṇapūra, describes Acyutānanda as a disciple of Gadādhara Paṇḍita and a great and dear devotee of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. According to the opinion of some, he was an incarnation of Kārttikeya, the son of Lord Śiva, and according to others he was formerly the *gopī* named Acyutā. The *Gaura-gaṇoddeśa-dīpikā* (88) supports both these opinions. Another book, *Narottama-vilāsa,* compiled by Śrī Narahari dāsa, mentions Acyutānanda’s presence during the festival at Khetari. According to Śrī Narahari dāsa, during the last days of his life Acyutānanda stayed in his house at Śāntipura, but during the presence of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu he lived at Jagannātha Purī with Gadādhara Paṇḍita.

**Kṛṣṇa Miśra was a son of Advaita Ācārya. Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu always sat in his heart.**

### Purport

Of the six sons of Advaita Ācārya, three, Acyutānanda, Kṛṣṇa Miśra and Gopāla dāsa, lived faithfully in the service of Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Since Acyutānanda did not accept a wife, he had no issue. The second son of Advaita Ācārya, Kṛṣṇa Miśra, had two sons, Raghunātha Cakravartī and Dola-govinda. The descendants of Raghunātha still live in Śāntipura, in the neighborhoods of Madana-gopāla-pāḍa, Gaṇakara, Mṛjāpura and Kumārakhāli. Dola-govinda had three sons, namely Cāṅda, Kandarpa and Gopīnātha. The descendants of Kandarpa live in Maldah, in the village Jikābāḍī. Gopīnātha had three sons, Śrīvallabha, Prāṇavallabha and Keśava. The descendants of Śrīvallabha live in the villages known as Maśiyāḍārā (Mahiṣaḍerā), Dāmukadiyā and Caṇḍīpura. There is a genealogical table for the family of Śrīvallabha beginning from his eldest son, Gaṅgā-nārāyaṇa. The descendants of Śrīvallabha’s youngest son, Rāmagopāla, still live in Dāmukadiyā, Caṇḍīpura, Śolamāri, and so on. The descendants of Prāṇavallabha and Keśava live in Uthalī. The son of Prāṇavallabha was Ratneśvara, and his son was Kṛṣṇarāma, whose youngest son was Lakṣmī-nārāyaṇa. His son was Navakiśora, and Navakiśora’s second son was Rāmamohana, whose eldest son was Jagabandhu and whose third son, Vīracandra, accepted the *sannyāsa* order and established a Deity of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu in Katwa. These two sons of Rāmamohana were known as Baḍa Prabhu and Choṭa Prabhu, and they inaugurated the circumambulation of Navadvīpa-dhāma. One may refer to the *Vaiṣṇava-mañjuṣā* for the complete genealogical table of Advaita Prabhu in the line of Kṛṣṇa Miśra.

### Translation

**The other sons of Advaita Ācārya were Śrī Balarāma, Svarūpa and Jagadīśa.**

### Purport

The Sanskrit book *Advaita-carita* states that Balarāma, Svarūpa and Jagadīśa were the fourth, fifth and sixth sons of Advaita Ācārya. Therefore Śrī Advaita Ācārya had six sons. Balarāma, Svarūpa and Jagadīśa, being *smārtas,* or Māyāvādīs, were rejected by Vaiṣṇava society. Sometimes Māyāvādīs pose themselves as Vaiṣṇavas, or worshipers of Lord Viṣṇu, but actually they do not believe in Lord Viṣṇu as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for they consider demigods like Lord Śiva, Durgā, the sun-god and Gaṇeśa equal to Him. They are generally known as *pañcopāsaka-smārtas,* and one should not count them among the Vaiṣṇavas.

Balarāma had three wives and nine sons. The youngest son of his first wife was known as Madhusūdana Gosvāmī. He took the title Bhaṭṭācārya and accepted the path of the *smārta* or Māyāvāda philosophy. Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura notes that the son of Gosvāmī Bhaṭṭācārya, Śrī Rādhāramaṇa Gosvāmī Bhaṭṭācārya, refused the title *gosvāmī* because it is generally meant for *sannyāsīs,* those who have taken the renounced order of life. One who is still in family life should not misuse the title *gosvāmī.* Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura did not recognize the caste *gosvāmīs* because they were not in the line of the six *gosvāmīs* in the renounced order who were direct disciples of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu — namely Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī, Śrīla Sanātana Gosvāmī, Śrīla Bhaṭṭa Raghunātha Gosvāmī, Śrī Gopāla Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmī, Śrī Jīva Gosvāmī and Śrīla Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī. Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura said that the *gṛhastha āśrama,* or the status of family life, is a sort of concession for sense gratification. Therefore a *gṛhastha* should not falsely adopt the title *gosvāmī.* The ISKCON movement has never conferred the title *gosvāmī* upon a householder. Although all the *sannyāsīs* we have initiated in ISKCON are young, we have awarded them the titles of the renounced order of life, *svāmī* and *gosvāmī,* because they have completely dedicated their lives to preach the cult of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura mentions that not only do the householder caste *gosvāmīs* disrespect the title *gosvāmī,* but also, following the principles of the *smārta* Raghunandana, they exhibit great foolishness by burning a straw image of Advaita Ācārya in a *śrāddha* ceremony, thus acting like Rākṣasas and disrespecting the *Hari-bhakti-vilāsa,* which is the guide for Vaiṣṇavas. Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura says that sometimes these *smārta* caste *gosvāmīs* write books on Vaiṣṇava philosophy or commentaries on the original scriptures, but a pure devotee should cautiously avoid reading them.

The name Kamalānanda mentioned in the *Ādi-līlā* (10.149) and the name Kamalākānta mentioned in the *Madhya-līlā* (10.94) both refer to the same man. Kamalākānta, a very confidential servant of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu born in a *brāhmaṇa* family, engaged in the service of Śrī Advaita Ācārya as His secretary. When Paramānanda Purī went from Navadvīpa to Jagannātha Purī, he took Kamalākānta Viśvāsa with him, and they both went to see Lord Caitanya at Jagannātha Purī. It is mentioned in the *Madhya-līlā* (10.94) that one of the devotees of Lord Caitanya, the *brāhmaṇa* Kamalākānta, went with Paramānanda Purī to Jagannātha Purī.

### Translation

**“But he has made the incarnation of Godhead a poverty-stricken beggar. Therefore I shall punish him in order to correct him.”**

### Purport

To describe a man as an incarnation of God, or Nārāyaṇa, and at the same time present him as poverty-stricken is contradictory, and it is the greatest offense. The Māyāvādī philosophers, engaged in the missionary work of spoiling the Vedic culture by preaching that everyone is God, describe a poverty-stricken man as *daridra-nārāyaṇa,* or “poor Nārāyaṇa.” Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu never accepted such foolish and unauthorized ideas. He strictly warned, *māyāvādi-bhāṣya śunile haya sarva-nāśa:* “Anyone who follows the principles of Māyāvāda philosophy is certainly doomed.” Such a fool needs to be reformed by punishment.

Although it is contradictory to say that the Supreme Personality of Godhead or His incarnation is poverty-stricken, we find in the revealed scriptures that when the Lord incarnated as Vāmana, He begged some land from Mahārāja Bali. Everyone knows, however, that Vāmanadeva was not at all poverty-stricken. His begging from Mahārāja Bali was a device to favor him. When Mahārāja Bali actually gave the land, Vāmanadeva exhibited His all-powerful position by covering the three worlds with three steps. One should not accept the so-called *daridra-nārāyaṇas* as incarnations, because they are completely unable to show the opulence of the genuine incarnations of God.

### Purport

The *bāuliyās,* or *bāulas,* are one of thirteen unauthorized sects that pass as followers of Caitanya Mahāprabhu. The Lord ordered Govinda, His personal assistant, not to allow Kamalākānta Viśvāsa to come into His presence because he had become a *bāuliyā.* Thus although the *bāula-sampradāya, āula-sampradāya* and *sahajiyā-sampradāya,* as well as the *smārtas, jāta-gosāñis, ativāḍīs, cūḍādhārīs* and *gaurāṅga-nāgarīs,* claim to belong to the disciplic succession of Caitanya Mahāprabhu, the Lord actually rejected them.

### Translation

**When Kamalākānta Viśvāsa heard about this punishment by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, he was very unhappy, but when Advaita Prabhu heard about it, He was greatly pleased.**

### Purport

In the *Bhagavad-gītā* (9.29) the Lord says, *samo ’haṁ sarva-bhūteṣu na me dveṣyo ’sti na priyaḥ:* “I envy no one, nor am I partial to anyone. I am equal to all.” The Supreme Personality of Godhead being equal to everyone, no one can be His enemy, nor can anyone be His friend. Since everyone is a part or son of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Lord cannot be partial and regard someone as a friend and someone as an enemy. Thus when Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu punished Kamalākānta Viśvāsa by no longer allowing him to come into His presence, although the punishment was actually very hard on him, Śrī Advaita Prabhu, understanding the inner meaning of such punishment, was happy because He appreciated that the Lord had actually favored Kamalākānta Viśvāsa. Therefore He was not at all unhappy. Devotees should always be happy with all the dealings of their master, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. A devotee may be put into difficulty or opulence, but he should accept both as gifts of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and jubilantly engage in the service of the Lord in all circumstances.

मुक्ति—श्रेष्ठ करि’ कैनु वाशिष्ठ व्याख्यान ।  
क्रुद्ध हञा प्रभु मोरे कैल अपमान ॥ ४० ॥

### Verse text

*mukti — śreṣṭha kari’ kainu vāśiṣṭha vyākhyāna  
kruddha hañā prabhu more kaila apamāna*

### Synonyms

*mukti* — liberation; *śreṣṭha* — the topmost; *kari’* — accepting; *kainu* — I did; *vāśiṣṭha* — the book known as *Yoga-vāśiṣṭha*; *vyākhyāna* — explanation; *kruddha* — angry; *hañā* — becoming; *prabhu* — the Lord; *more* — unto Me; *kaila* — did; *apamāna* — disrespect.

### Translation

**“Thus I expounded the Yoga-vāśiṣṭha, which considers liberation the ultimate goal of life. For this the Lord became angry at Me and treated Me with apparent disrespect.**

### Purport

There is a book of the name *Yoga-vāśiṣṭha* that Māyāvādīs greatly favor because it is full of impersonal misunderstandings regarding the Supreme Personality of Godhead, with no touch of Vaiṣṇavism. Factually, all Vaiṣṇavas should avoid such a book, but Advaita Ācārya Prabhu, wanting punishment from the Lord, began to support the impersonal statements of the *Yoga-vāśiṣṭha.* Thus Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu became extremely angry at Him and seemingly treated Him disrespectfully.

### Translation

**“When chastised by Lord Caitanya, I was very happy to receive a punishment similar to that awarded Śrī Mukunda.**

### Purport

Śrī Mukunda, a great friend and associate of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, used to visit many places where people were against the Vaiṣṇava cult. When Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu came to know of this, He punished Mukunda, forbidding him to see Him again. Although Caitanya Mahāprabhu was soft like a flower, He was also strict like a thunderbolt, and everyone was afraid to allow Mukunda to come again into the presence of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Mukunda, therefore, being very sorry, asked his friends whether he would one day be allowed to see Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. When the devotees brought this inquiry to Lord Caitanya, the Lord replied, “Mukunda will get permission to see Me after many millions of years.” When they gave this information to Mukunda, he danced with jubilation, and when Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu heard that Mukunda was so patiently waiting to meet Him after millions of years, He immediately asked him to return. There is a statement about this punishment of Mukunda in the *Caitanya-bhāgavata, Madhya-khaṇḍa,* tenth chapter.

### Purport

Mother Śacīdevī was similarly punished, as mentioned in the *Caitanya-bhāgavata, Madhya-khaṇḍa,* chapter twenty-two. Mother Śacīdevī, apparently showing her feminine nature, accused Advaita Prabhu of encouraging her son to become a *sannyāsī.* Caitanya Mahāprabhu, taking this accusation as an offense, asked Śacīdevī to touch the lotus feet of Advaita Ācārya to mitigate the offense she had supposedly committed.

### Purport

This is a reference to Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s former punishment of Advaita Ācārya. When Advaita Ācārya Prabhu was reading *Yoga-vāśiṣṭha,* Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu beat Him, but He never told Him not to come into His presence. But Kamalākānta was punished with the order never to come into the Lord’s presence. Therefore Śrī Advaita Ācārya Prabhu wanted to impress upon Caitanya Mahāprabhu that He had shown more favor to Kamalākānta Viśvāsa because He had prohibited Kamalākānta from seeing Him, whereas He had not done so to Advaita Ācārya. Therefore the favor shown Kamalākānta Viśvāsa was greater than that shown Advaita Ācārya.

### Translation

**Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu instructed Kamalākānta, “You are a bāuliyā, one who does not know things as they are. Why do you act in this way? Why do you invade the privacy of Advaita Ācārya and damage His religious principles?**

### Purport

Kamalākānta Viśvāsa, out of his ignorance, asked the King of Jagannātha Purī, Mahārāja Pratāparudra, to liquidate the three-hundred-rupee debt of Advaita Ācārya, but at the same time he established Advaita Ācārya as an incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is contradictory. An incarnation of the Supreme Godhead cannot be indebted to anyone in this material world. Caitanya Mahāprabhu is never satisfied by such a contradiction, which is technically called *rasābhāsa,* or overlapping of one humor (*rasa*) with another. This is the same type of idea as the contradiction that Nārāyaṇa is poverty-stricken (*daridra-nārāyaṇa*)*.*

प्रतिग्रह कभु ना करिवे राजधन ।

### Verse text

*pratigraha kabhu nā karibe rāja-dhana  
viṣayīra anna khāile duṣṭa haya mana*

### Synonyms

*pratigraha* — acceptance of alms; *kabhu* — at any time; *nā* — not; *karibe* — should do; *rāja*-*dhana* — charity by kings; *viṣayīra* — of men who are materialistic; *anna* — food; *khāile* — by eating; *duṣṭa* — polluted; *haya* — becomes; *mana* — mind.

### Translation

**“Advaita Ācārya, My spiritual master, should never accept charity from rich men or kings, because if a spiritual master accepts money or grains from such materialists his mind becomes polluted.**

### Purport

It is very risky to accept money or food from materialistic persons, for such acceptance pollutes the mind of the charity’s recipient. According to the Vedic system, one should give charity to *sannyāsīs* and *brāhmaṇas* because one who thus gives charity becomes free from sinful activities. Formerly, therefore, *brāhmaṇas* would not accept charity from a person unless he were very pious. Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu gave this instruction for all spiritual masters. Materialistic persons who are not inclined to give up their sinful activities like illicit sex, intoxication, gambling and meat-eating sometimes want to become our disciples, but, unlike professional spiritual masters who accept disciples regardless of their condition, Vaiṣṇavas do not accept such cheap disciples. One must at least agree to abide by the rules and regulations for a disciple before a Vaiṣṇava *ācārya* can accept him. In fact, a Vaiṣṇava should not even accept charity or food from persons who do not follow the rules and regulations of the Vaiṣṇava principles.

*mana duṣṭa ha-ile nahe kṛṣṇera smaraṇa  
kṛṣṇa-smṛti vinu haya niṣphala jīvana*

### Synonyms

*mana* — mind; *duṣṭa* — polluted; *ha*-*ile* — becoming; *nahe* — is not possible; *kṛṣṇera* — of Lord Kṛṣṇa; *smaraṇa* — remembrance; *kṛṣṇa*-*smṛti* — remembrance of Lord Kṛṣṇa; *vinu* — without; *haya* — becomes; *niṣphala* — without any result; *jīvana* — life.

### Translation

**“When one’s mind is polluted, it is very difficult to remember Kṛṣṇa, and when remembrance of Lord Kṛṣṇa is hampered, one’s life is unproductive.**

### Purport

A devotee should always be alert, keeping his mind in a sanguine state so that he can always remember Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa. The *śāstras* state, *smartavyaḥ satataṁ viṣṇuḥ:* in devotional life one should always remember Lord Viṣṇu. Śrīla Śukadeva Gosvāmī also advised Mahārāja Parīkṣit, *smartavyo nityaśaḥ.* In the Second Canto, first chapter, of *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,* Śukadeva Gosvāmī advised Parīkṣit Mahārāja:

*tasmād bhārata sarvātmā* *bhagavān īśvaro hariḥ  
śrotavyaḥ kīrtitavyaś ca* *smartavyaś cecchatābhayam*

“O descendant of King Bharata, one who desires to be free from all miseries must hear about, glorify and also remember the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the Supersoul, the controller and the savior from all miseries.” (*Bhāg.* 2.1.5) This is the summary of all the activities of a Vaiṣṇava, and the same instruction is repeated here (*kṛṣṇa-smṛti vinu haya niṣphala jīvana*)*.* Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī states in his *Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu, avyartha-kālatvam:* A Vaiṣṇava must be very alert not to waste even a second of his valuable lifetime. This is a symptom of a Vaiṣṇava. But association with pounds-and-shillings men, or *viṣayīs,* materialists who are simply interested in sense gratification, pollutes one’s mind and hampers such continuous remembrance of Lord Kṛṣṇa. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu therefore advised, *asat-saṅga-tyāga — ei vaiṣṇava-ācāra:* a Vaiṣṇava should behave in such a way as to never associate with nondevotees or materialists (Cc. *Madhya* 22.87). One can avoid such association simply by always remembering Kṛṣṇa within his heart.

The sixth verse of *Śākhā-nirṇayāmṛta,* a book written by Yadunandana dāsa, states that Bhāgavata Ācārya compiled a famous book of the name *Prema-taraṅgiṇī.* According to the *Gaura-gaṇoddeśa-dīpikā* (195), Bhāgavata Ācārya formerly lived in Vṛndāvana as Śveta-mañjarī. Viṣṇudāsa Ācārya was present during the Khetari-mahotsava. He went there with Acyutānanda, as stated in the *Bhakti-ratnākara,* Tenth *Taraṅga.* Ananta Ācārya was one of the eight principal *gopīs.* His former name was Sudevī.

### Translation

**A person without Kṛṣṇa consciousness is no better than dry wood or a dead body. He is understood to be dead while living, and after death he is punishable by Yamarāja.**

### Purport

In the *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,* Sixth Canto, third chapter, twenty-ninth verse, Yamarāja, the superintendent of death, tells his assistants what class of men they should bring before him. There he states, “A person whose tongue never describes the qualities and holy name of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, whose heart never throbs as he remembers Kṛṣṇa and His lotus feet, and whose head never bows in obeisances to the Supreme Lord must be brought before me for punishment.” In other words, nondevotees are brought before Yamarāja for punishment, and thus material nature awards them various types of bodies. After death, which is *dehāntara,* a change of body, nondevotees are brought before Yamarāja for justice. By the judgment of Yamarāja, material nature gives them bodies suitable for the reactions of their past activities. This is the process of *dehāntara,* or transmigration of the self from one body to another. Kṛṣṇa conscious devotees, however, are not subject to be judged by Yamarāja. For devotees there is an open road, as confirmed in the *Bhagavad-gītā.* After giving up the body (*tyaktvā deham*), a devotee never again has to accept another material body, for in a spiritual body he goes back home, back to Godhead. The punishments of Yamarāja are meant for persons who are not Kṛṣṇa conscious.

### Translation

**The descendants of Advaita Ācārya who accepted the path of Śrī Acyutānanda were all great devotees.**

### Purport

In this connection, Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura, in his *Amṛta-pravāha-bhāṣya,* gives this short note: “Śrī Advaita Ācārya is one of the important trunks of the *bhakti-kalpataru,* or desire tree of devotional service. Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, as a gardener, poured water on the root of the *bhakti* tree and thus nourished all its trunks and branches. But nevertheless, under the spell of *māyā,* the most unfortunate condition of a living entity, some of the branches, not accepting the gardener who poured water on them, considered the trunk the only cause of the great *bhakti-kalpataru.* In other words, the branches or descendants of Advaita Ācārya who considered Advaita Ācārya the original cause of the devotional creeper, and who thus neglected or disobeyed the instructions of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, deprived themselves of the effect of being watered and thus dried up and died. It is further to be understood that not only the misguided descendants of Advaita Ācārya but anyone who has no connection with Caitanya Mahāprabhu — even if he is independently a great *sannyāsī,* learned scholar or ascetic — is like a dead branch of a tree.”

This analysis by Śrī Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura, supporting the statements of Śrī Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī, depicts the position of the present so-called Hindu religion, which, being predominantly conducted by the Māyāvāda philosophy, has become a hodgepodge institution of various concocted ideas. Māyāvādīs greatly fear the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement and accuse it of spoiling the Hindu religion because it accepts people from all parts of the world and all religious sects and scientifically engages them in the *daiva-varṇāśrama-dharma.* As we have explained several times, however, we find no such word as “Hindu” in the Vedic literature. The word most probably came from Afghanistan, a predominantly Muslim country, and originally referred to a pass in Afghanistan known as Hindukush, which is still a part of a trade route between India and various Muslim countries.

The actual Vedic system of religion is called *varṇāśrama-dharma,* as confirmed in the *Viṣṇu Purāṇa:*

*varṇāśramācāra-vatā* *puruṣeṇa paraḥ pumān  
viṣṇur ārādhyate panthā* *nānyat tat-toṣa-kāraṇam*

(*Viṣṇu Purāṇa* 3.8.9)

The Vedic literature recommends that a human being follow the principles of *varṇāśrama-dharma.* Accepting the process of *varṇāśrama-dharma* will make a person’s life successful because this will connect him with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the goal of human life. Therefore the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is meant for all of humanity. Although human society has different sections or subdivisions, all human beings belong to one species, and therefore we accept that they all have the ability to understand their constitutional position in connection with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Viṣṇu. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu confirms, *jīvera ‘svarūpa’ haya — kṛṣṇera nitya-dāsa:* “Every living entity is an eternal part, an eternal servant, of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.” Every living entity who attains the human form of life can understand the importance of his position and thus become eligible to become a devotee of Lord Kṛṣṇa. We take it for granted, therefore, that all humanity should be educated in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Indeed, in all parts of the world, in every country where we preach the *saṅkīrtana* movement, we find that people very easily accept the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra* without hesitation. The visible effect of this chanting is that the members of the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement, regardless of their backgrounds, all give up the four principles of sinful life and come to an elevated standard of devotion.

Although posing as great scholars, ascetics, householders and *svāmīs,* the so-called followers of the Hindu religion are all useless, dried-up branches of the Vedic religion. They are impotent; they cannot do anything to spread the Vedic culture for the benefit of human society. The essence of the Vedic culture is the message of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Lord Caitanya instructed:

*yāre dekha, tāre kaha ‘kṛṣṇa’ upadeśa  
āmāra ājñāya guru hañā tāra’ ei deśa*

(Cc*. Madhya* 7.128)

One should simply instruct everyone he meets regarding the principles of *kṛṣṇa-kathā,* as expressed in *Bhagavad-gītā As It Is* and *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.* One who has no interest in *kṛṣṇa-kathā* or the cult of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is like dry, useless wood with no living force. The ISKCON branch, being directly watered by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, is becoming undoubtedly successful, whereas the disconnected branches of the so-called Hindu religion that are envious of ISKCON are drying up and dying.

The *Gaura-gaṇoddeśa-dīpikā* (202) mentions Jitāmitra as the *gopī* named Śyāma-mañjarī. Jitāmitra wrote a book entitled *Kṛṣṇa-māyurya.* Jagannātha dāsa was a resident of Vikramapura, near Dacca. His birthplace was the village known as Kāṣṭhakāṭā or Kāṭhādiyā. His descendants now reside in villages known as Āḍiyala, Kāmārapāḍā and Pāikapāḍā. He established a temple of Yaśomādhava. The worshipers in this temple are the Gosvāmīs of Āḍiyala. As one of the sixty-four *sakhīs,* he was formerly an assistant of Citrādevī-gopī named Tilakinī. The following is a list of his descendants: Rāmanṛsiṁha, Rāmagopāla, Rāmacandra, Sanātana, Muktārāma, Gopīnātha, Goloka, Harimohana Śiromaṇi, Rākhālarāja, Mādhava and Lakṣmīkānta. The *Śākhā-nirṇaya* mentions that Jagannātha dāsa preached the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement in the district or state of Tripura.”

### Synonyms

### Translation

**The nineteenth branch was Śrī Hari Ācārya; the twentieth, Sādipuriyā Gopāla; the twenty-first, Kṛṣṇadāsa Brahmacārī; and the twenty-second, Puṣpagopāla.**

### Purport

The *Gaura-gaṇoddeśa-dīpikā* (196 and 207) mentions that Hari Ācārya was formerly the *gopī* named Kālākṣī. Sādipuriyā Gopāla is celebrated as a preacher of the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement in Vikramapura, in East Bengal (now Bangladesh). Kṛṣṇadāsa Brahmacārī was formerly among the group of *sakhīs* known as the *aṣṭa-sakhīs.* His name was Indulekhā. Kṛṣṇadāsa Brahmacārī lived in Vṛndāvana. There is a tomb in the Rādhā-Dāmodara temple known as Kṛṣṇadāsa’s tomb. Some say that this is the tomb of Kṛṣṇadāsa Brahmacārī, and others say it is that of Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī. In either case we offer our respects because both of them were expert in distributing love of Godhead to the fallen souls of this age. The *Śākhā-nirṇaya* mentions that Puṣpagopāla was formerly known as Svarṇagrāmaka.

Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura writes in his *Anubhāṣya,* “Śrī Maṅgala Vaiṣṇava was a resident of the village Ṭiṭakaṇā in the district of Murshidabad. His forefathers were *śāktas* who worshiped the goddess Kirīṭeśvarī. It is said that Maṅgala Vaiṣṇava, formerly a staunch *brahmacārī,* left home and later married the daughter of his disciple Prāṇanātha Adhikārī in the village of Mayanāḍāla. The descendants of this family are known as the Ṭhākuras of Kāṅdaḍā, which is a village in the district of Burdwan near Katwa. Scattered descendants of Maṅgala Vaiṣṇava, thirty-six families altogether, still live there. Among the celebrated disciples of Maṅgala Ṭhākura are Prāṇanātha Adhikārī, Puruṣottama Cakravartī of the village of Kāṅdaḍā, and Nṛsiṁha-prasāda Mitra, whose family members are well-known *mṛdaṅga* players. Sudhākṛṣṇa Mitra and Nikuñjavihārī Mitra are both especially famous *mṛdaṅga* players. In the family of Puruṣottama Cakravartī there are famous persons like Kuñjavihārī Cakravartī and Rādhāvallabha Cakravartī, who now live in the district of Birbhum. They professionally recite songs from *Caitanya-maṅgala.* It is said that when Maṅgala Ṭhākura was constructing a road from Bengal to Jagannātha Purī, he found a Deity of Rādhāvallabha while digging a lake. At that time he was living in the locality of Kāṅdaḍā, in the village named Rāṇīpura. The *śālagrāma-śilā* personally worshiped by Maṅgala Ṭhākura still exists in the village of Kāṅdaḍā. A temple has been constructed there for the worship of Vṛndāvana-candra. Maṅgala Ṭhākura had three sons — Rādhikāprasāda, Gopīramaṇa and Śyāmakiśora. The descendants of these three sons are still living.”
