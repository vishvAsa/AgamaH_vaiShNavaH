### Bengali

श्रीचैतन्यपदाम्भोज–मधुपेभ्यो नमो नमः ।  
कथञ्चिदाश्रय़ाद्‌ येषां श्वापि तद्‌गन्धभाग्‌भवेत् ॥ १ ॥

### Verse text

*śrī-caitanya-padāmbhoja-  
madhupebhyo namo namaḥ  
kathañcid āśrayād yeṣāṁ  
śvāpi tad-gandha-bhāg bhavet*

### Synonyms

*śrī*-*caitanya* — Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu; *pada*-*ambhoja* — the lotus feet; *madhu* — honey; *pebhyaḥ* — unto those who drink; *namaḥ* — respectful obeisances; *namaḥ* — respectful obeisances; *kathañcit* — a little of it; *āśrayāt* — taking shelter of; *yeṣām* — of whom; *śvā* — dog; *api* — also; *tat*-*gandha* — the aroma of the lotus flower; *bhāk* — shareholder; *bhavet* — may become.

### Translation

**Let me repeatedly offer my respectful obeisances unto the beelike devotees who always taste the honey of the lotus feet of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. If even a doggish nondevotee somehow takes shelter of such devotees, he enjoys the aroma of the lotus flower.**

### Purport

The example of a dog is very significant in this connection. A dog naturally does not become a devotee at any time, but still it is sometimes found that a dog of a devotee gradually becomes a devotee also. We have actually seen that a dog has no respect even for the *tulasī* plant. Indeed, a dog is especially inclined to pass urine on the *tulasī* plant. Therefore the dog is the number one nondevotee. But Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s *saṅkīrtana* movement is so strong that even a doglike nondevotee can gradually become a devotee by the association of a devotee of Lord Caitanya. Śrīla Śivānanda Sena, a great householder devotee of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, attracted a dog on the street while going to Jagannātha Purī. The dog began to follow him and ultimately went to see Caitanya Mahāprabhu and was liberated. Similarly, cats and dogs in the household of Śrīvāsa Ṭhākura were also liberated. Cats and dogs and other animals are not expected to become devotees, but in the association of a pure devotee they are also delivered.

वन्दे श्रीकृष्णचैतन्य–प्रेमामरतरोः प्रिय़ान्‌ ।

*vande śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya-  
premāmara-taroḥ priyān  
śākhā-rūpān bhakta-gaṇān  
kṛṣṇa-prema-phala-pradān*

### Synonyms

*vande* — I offer my obeisances; *śrī*-*kṛṣṇa*-*caitanya* — to Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu; *prema*-*amara*-*taroḥ* — of the eternal tree full of love of Godhead; *priyān* — those who are devotees; *śākhā*-*rūpān* — represented as branches; *bhakta*-*gaṇān* — all the devotees; *kṛṣṇa*-*prema* — of love of Kṛṣṇa; *phala* — of the fruit; *pradān* — the givers.

### Purport

Śrī Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī sets the example of offering obeisances to all the preacher devotees of Lord Caitanya, without distinction as to higher and lower. Unfortunately, at present there are many foolish so-called devotees of Lord Caitanya who make such distinctions. For example, the title *“*Prabhupāda” is offered to a spiritual master, especially to a distinguished spiritual master such as Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī Prabhupāda, Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī Prabhupāda or Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Gosvāmī Prabhupāda. When our disciples similarly wanted to address their spiritual master as Prabhupāda, some foolish people became envious. Not considering the propaganda work of the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement, simply because these disciples addressed their spiritual master as Prabhupāda they became so envious that they formed a faction along with other such envious persons just to minimize the value of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. To chastise such fools, Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī very frankly says, *keha karibāre nāre jyeṣṭha-laghu-krama.* Anyone who is a bona fide preacher of the cult of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu must be respectful to the real devotees of Lord Caitanya; one should not be envious, considering one preacher to be very great and another to be very lowly. This is a material distinction and has no place on the platform of spiritual activities. Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī therefore offers equal respect to all the preachers of the cult of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, who are compared to the branches of the tree. ISKCON is one of these branches, and it should therefore be respected by all sincere devotees of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

### Translation

**The two brothers Śrīvāsa Paṇḍita and Śrī Rāma Paṇḍita started two branches that are well known in the world.**

### Purport

In the *Gaura-gaṇoddeśa-dīpikā* (90), Śrīvāsa Paṇḍita (Śrīvāsa Ṭhākura) is described as an incarnation of Nārada Muni, and Śrī Rāma Paṇḍita, his younger brother, is said to be an incarnation of Parvata Muni, a great friend of Nārada’s. Śrīvāsa Paṇḍita’s wife, Mālinī, is celebrated as an incarnation of the nurse Ambikā, who fed Lord Kṛṣṇa with her breast milk, and as already noted, his niece Nārāyaṇī, the mother of Ṭhākura Vṛndāvana dāsa, the author of *Śrī Caitanya-bhāgavata,* was the sister of Ambikā in *kṛṣṇa-līlā.* We also understand from the description of *Śrī Caitanya-bhāgavata* that after Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s acceptance of the *sannyāsa* order, Śrīvāsa Paṇḍita left Navadvīpa, possibly because of feelings of separation, and domiciled at Kumārahaṭṭa.

### Verse text

*cāri bhāi sa-vaṁśe kare caitanyera sevā  
gauracandra vinā nāhi jāne devī-devā*

### Translation

**These four brothers and their family members fully engaged in the service of Lord Caitanya. They knew no other god or goddess.**

### Purport

Śrīla Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura has said, *anya-devāśraya nāi, tomāre kahinu bhāi, ei bhakti parama-kāraṇa:* if one wants to become a pure, staunch devotee, one should not take shelter of any of the demigods or
-goddesses. Foolish Māyāvādīs say that worshiping demigods is as good as worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but that is not a fact. This philosophy misleads people to atheism. One who has no idea what God actually is thinks that any form he imagines or any rascal he accepts can be God. This acceptance of cheap gods or incarnations of God is actually atheism. It is to be concluded, therefore, that those who worship demigods or self-proclaimed incarnations of God are all atheists. They have lost their knowledge, as confirmed in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (7.20): *kāmais tais tair hṛta-jñānāḥ prapadyante ’nya-devatāḥ.* “Those whose minds are distorted by material desires surrender unto demigods.” Unfortunately, those who do not cultivate Kṛṣṇa consciousness and do not properly understand the Vedic knowledge accept any rascal to be an incarnation of God, and they are of the opinion that one can become an incarnation simply by worshiping a demigod. This philosophical hodge-podge exists under the name of the Hindu religion, but the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement does not approve of it. Indeed, we strongly condemn it. Such worship of demigods and so-called incarnations of God should never be confused with the pure Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement.

### Verse text

*ācāryaratnera nāma ‘śrī-candraśekhara’ —  
yāṅra ghare devī-bhāve nācilā īśvara*

### Synonyms

*ācāryaratnera* — of Ācāryaratna; *nāma* — name; *śrī*-*candraśekhara* — Śrī Candraśekhara; *yāṅra* — of whom; *ghare* — in the home; *devī*-*bhāve* — as the goddess; *nācilā* — danced; *īśvara* — Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

### Translation

**Ācāryaratna was also named Śrī Candraśekhara Ācārya. In a drama in his house, Lord Caitanya played the goddess of fortune.**

### Purport

Dramatic performances were enacted during the presence of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, but the players who took part in such dramas were all pure devotees; no outsiders were allowed. The members of ISKCON should follow this example. Whenever they stage dramatic performances about the lives of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu or Lord Kṛṣṇa, the players must be pure devotees. Professional players and dramatic actors have no sense of devotional service, and therefore although they can perform very artistically, there is no life in such performances. Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura used to refer to such an actor as *yātrā-dale nārada,* which means “farcical Nārada.” Sometimes an actor in a drama plays the part of Nārada Muni, although in his private life he is not at all like Nārada Muni because he is not a devotee. Such actors are not needed in dramatic performances about the lives of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and Lord Kṛṣṇa.

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu used to perform dramas with Advaita Prabhu, Śrīvāsa Ṭhākura and other devotees in the house of Candraśekhara. The place where Candraśekhara’s house was situated is now known as Vrajapattana. Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura established the Śrī Caitanya Maṭha at this place. When Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu decided to accept the renounced order of life, Candraśekhara Ācārya was informed of this by Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu, and therefore he was present when Lord Caitanya accepted *sannyāsa* from Keśava Bhāratī in Katwa. It is he who first spread the word in Navadvīpa of Lord Caitanya’s accepting *sannyāsa.* Śrī Candraśekhara Ācārya was present during many important incidents in the pastimes of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. He therefore forms the second branch of the tree of Lord Caitanya.

पुण्डरीक विद्यानिधि—वड़शाखा जानि ।

*puṇḍarīka vidyānidhi — baḍa-śākhā jāni  
yāṅra nāma lañā prabhu kāndilā āpani*

### Synonyms

*puṇḍarīka* *vidyānidhi* — Puṇḍarīka Vidyānidhi; *baḍa*-*śākhā* — another big branch; *jāni* — I know; *yāṅra* *nāma* — whose name; *lañā* — taking; *prabhu* — the Lord; *kāndilā* — cried; *āpani* — Himself.

### Translation

**Puṇḍarīka Vidyānidhi, the third big branch, was so dear to Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu that in his absence Lord Caitanya Himself would sometimes cry.**

### Purport

In the *Gaura-gaṇoddeśa-dīpikā* (54), Śrīla Puṇḍarīka Vidyānidhi is described as the father of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī in *kṛṣṇa-līlā.* Caitanya Mahāprabhu therefore treated him as His father. Puṇḍarīka Vidyānidhi’s father was known as Bāṇeśvara or, according to another opinion, Śuklāmbara Brahmacārī, and his mother’s name was Gaṅgādevī. According to one opinion, Bāṇeśvara was a descendent of Śrī Śivarāma Gaṅgopādhyāya. The original home of Puṇḍarīka Vidyānidhi was in East Bengal (now Bangladesh), in a village near Dacca named Bāghiyā, which belonged to the Vārendra group of *brāhmaṇa* families. Sometimes these Vārendra *brāhmaṇas* were at odds with another group known as Rāḍhīya *brāhmaṇas,* and therefore Puṇḍarīka Vidyānidhi’s family was ostracized and at that time was not living as a respectable family.

Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura writes in his *Anubhāṣya,* “One of the members of this family is living in Vṛndāvana and is named Sarojānanda Gosvāmī. One special characteristic of this family is that each of its members had only one son or no son at all, and therefore the family was not very expansive. There is a place in the district of Caṭṭagrāma in East Bengal that is known as Hāta-hājāri, and a short distance from this place is a village known as Mekhalā-grāma, in which Puṇḍarīka Vidyānidhi’s forefathers lived. One can approach Mekhalā-grāma from Caṭṭagrāma either on horseback, by bullock cart or by steamer. The steamer station is known as Annapūrṇāra-ghāṭa. The birthplace of Puṇḍarīka Vidyānidhi is about two miles southwest of Annapūrṇāra-ghāṭa. The temple constructed there by Puṇḍarīka Vidyānidhi is now very old and much in need of repair. Without repair, the temple may soon crumble. There are two inscriptions on the bricks of that temple, but they are so old that one cannot read them. There is another temple, however, about two hundred yards south of this one, and some people say that this is the old temple constructed by Puṇḍarīka Vidyānidhi.”

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu called Puṇḍarīka Vidyānidhi “father,” and He gave him the title Premanidhi. Puṇḍarīka Vidyānidhi later became the spiritual master of Gadādhara Paṇḍita and an intimate friend of Svarūpa Dāmodara’s. Gadādhara Paṇḍita at first misunderstood Puṇḍarīka Vidyānidhi to be an ordinary pounds-and-shillings man, but later, upon being corrected by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, he became his disciple. Another incident in the life of Puṇḍarīka Vidyānidhi involves his criticizing the priest of the Jagannātha temple, for which Jagannātha Prabhu chastised him personally by slapping his cheeks. This is described in *Śrī Caitanya-bhāgavata, Antya-khaṇḍa,* chapter ten. Śrī Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura informs us that during his time there were still two living descendants of the family of Puṇḍarīka Vidyānidhi, who were named Śrī Harakumāra Smṛtitīrtha and Śrī Kṛṣṇakiṅkara Vidyālaṅkāra. For further information one should refer to the dictionary known as *Vaiṣṇava-mañjuṣā.*

### Verse text

*baḍa śākhā, — gadādhara paṇḍita-gosāñi  
teṅho lakṣmī-rūpā, tāṅra sama keha nāi*

### Synonyms

*baḍa* *śākhā* — big branch; *gadādhara* *paṇḍita*-*gosāñi* — the descendants or disciplic succession of Gadādhara Paṇḍita; *teṅho* — Gadādhara Paṇḍita; *lakṣmī*-*rūpā* — incarnation of the pleasure potency of Lord Kṛṣṇa; *tāṅra* — his; *sama* — equal; *keha* — anyone; *nāi* — there is none.

### Translation

**Gadādhara Paṇḍita, the fourth branch, is described as an incarnation of the pleasure potency of Śrī Kṛṣṇa. No one, therefore, can equal him.**

### Purport

In the *Gaura-gaṇoddeśa-dīpikā* (147-53) it is stated, “Śrī Kṛṣṇa's pleasure potency, formerly known as Vṛndāvaneśvarī, is now personified in the form of Śrī Gadādhara Paṇḍita in the pastimes of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Śrī Svarūpa Dāmodara Gosvāmī has pointed out that in the shape of Lakṣmī, the pleasure potency of Kṛṣṇa, she was formerly very dear to the Lord as Śyāmasundara-vallabhā. The same Śyāmasundara-vallabhā is now present in Lord Caitanya’s pastimes as Gadādhara Paṇḍita. Formerly, as Lalitā-sakhī, she was always devoted to Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī. Thus Gadādhara Paṇḍita is simultaneously an incarnation of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī and Lalitā-sakhī.” In the twelfth chapter of this part of the *Caitanya-caritāmṛta* there is a description of the descendants or disciplic succession of Gadādhara Paṇḍita.

### Purport

In the *Gaura-gaṇoddeśa-dīpikā* (71) it is stated that Vakreśvara Paṇḍita was an incarnation of Aniruddha, one of the quadruple expansions of Viṣṇu (Vāsudeva, Saṅkarṣaṇa, Aniruddha and Pradyumna). He could dance wonderfully for seventy-two continuous hours. When Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu played in dramatic performances in the house of Śrīvāsa Paṇḍita, Vakreśvara Paṇḍita was one of the chief dancers, and he danced continuously for that length of time. Śrī Govinda dāsa, an Oriyā devotee of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, has described the life of Vakreśvara Paṇḍita in his book *Gaura-kṛṣṇodaya.* There are many disciples of Vakreśvara Paṇḍita in Orissa, and they are known as Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇavas although they are Oriyās. Among these disciples are Śrī Gopālaguru and his disciple Śrī Dhyānacandra Gosvāmī.

“In Vraja there were two very nice singers named Madhukaṇṭha and Madhuvrata. They appeared in *caitanya-līlā* as Mukunda and Vāsudeva Datta, who were singers in the society of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu.” When Lord Caitanya was a student, Mukunda Datta was His class friend, and they frequently engaged in logical arguments. Sometimes Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu would fight with Mukunda Datta, using tricks of logic. This is described in the *Caitanya-bhāgavata, Ādi-khaṇḍa,* chapters eleven and twelve. When Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu returned from Gayā, Mukunda Datta gave Him pleasure by reciting verses from *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* about *kṛṣṇa-līlā.* It was by his endeavor that Gadādhara Paṇḍita Gosvāmī became a disciple of Puṇḍarīka Vidyānidhi, as stated in *Śrī Caitanya-bhāgavata, Madhya-khaṇḍa,* chapter seven. When Mukunda Datta sang in the courtyard of Śrīvāsa Prabhu, Mahāprabhu danced with His singing, and when Lord Caitanya for twenty-one hours exhibited an ecstatic manifestation known as *sāta-prahariyā,* Mukunda Datta inaugurated the function by singing.

Sometimes Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu chastised Mukunda Datta by calling him *khaḍajāṭhiyā beṭā* because he attended many functions held by different classes of nondevotees. This is stated in the *Caitanya-bhāgavata, Madhya-khaṇḍa,* chapter ten. When Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu dressed Himself as the goddess of fortune to dance in the house of Candraśekhara, Mukunda Datta began the first song.

Before disclosing His desire to take the renounced order of life, Lord Caitanya first went to the house of Mukunda Datta, but at that time Mukunda Datta requested Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu to continue His *saṅkīrtana* movement for a few days more before taking *sannyāsa.* This is stated in the *Caitanya-bhāgavata, Madhya-khaṇḍa,* chapter twenty-six. The information of Lord Caitanya’s accepting the renounced order was made known to Gadādhara Paṇḍita, Candraśekhara Ācārya and Mukunda Datta by Nityānanda Prabhu, and therefore all of them went to Katwa and arranged for *kīrtana* and all the paraphernalia for Lord Caitanya’s acceptance of *sannyāsa.* After the Lord took *sannyāsa,* they all followed Him, especially Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu, Gadādhara Prabhu and Mukunda Datta, who followed Him all the way to Puruṣottama-kṣetra. In this connection one may refer to *Śrī Caitanya-bhāgavata, Antya-khaṇḍa,* chapter two. In the place known as Jaleśvara, Nityānanda Prabhu broke the *sannyāsa* rod of Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Mukunda Datta was also present at that time. He went every year from Bengal to see Lord Caitanya at Jagannātha Purī.

### Synonyms

*vāsudeva* *datta* — Vāsudeva Datta; *prabhura* — of Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu; *bhṛtya* — servant; *mahāśaya* — great personality; *sahasra*-*mukhe* — with thousands of mouths; *yāṅra* — whose; *guṇa* — qualities; *kahile* — describing; *nā* — never; *haya* — becomes fulfilled.

### Translation

**Vāsudeva Datta, the nineteenth branch of the Śrī Caitanya tree, was a great personality and a most confidential devotee of the Lord. One could not describe his qualities even with thousands of mouths.**

### Purport

Vāsudeva Datta, the brother of Mukunda Datta, was also a resident of Caṭṭagrāma. In the *Caitanya-bhāgavata* it is said, *yāṅra sthāne kṛṣṇa haya āpane vikraya:* Vāsudeva Datta was such a powerful devotee that Kṛṣṇa was purchased by him. Vāsudeva Datta stayed at Śrīvāsa Paṇḍita’s house, and in the *Caitanya-bhāgavata* it is described that Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu was so pleased with Vāsudeva Datta and so affectionate toward him that He used to say, “I am only Vāsudeva Datta’s man. My body is only meant to please Vāsudeva Datta, and he can sell Me anywhere.” Thrice He vowed that this was a fact and that no one should disbelieve these statements. “All My dear devotees,” He said, “I tell you the truth. My body is especially meant for Vāsudeva Datta.” Vāsudeva Datta initiated Śrī Yadunandana Ācārya, the spiritual master of Raghunātha dāsa, who later became Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī. This will be found in the *Caitanya-caritāmṛta,* *Antya-līlā,* sixth chapter, verse 161. Vāsudeva Datta spent money very liberally; therefore Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu asked Śivānanda Sena to become his *sarakhela,* or secretary, in order to control his extravagant expenses. Vāsudeva Datta was so kind to the living entities that he wanted to take all their sinful reactions so that they might be delivered by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. This is described in the fifteenth chapter of the *Caitanya-caritāmṛta’s Madhya-līlā,* verses 159 through 180.

Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura writes in his *Anubhāṣya,* “There is a railway station named Pūrvasthalī near the Navadvīpa railway station, and about one mile away, in a village known as Māmagāchi, which is the birthplace of Vṛndāvana dāsa Ṭhākura, there is presently a temple of Madana-gopāla that was established by Vāsudeva Datta.” The Gauḍīya Maṭha devotees have now taken charge of this temple, and the *sevā-pūjā* is going on very nicely. Every year all the pilgrims on the *navadvīpa-parikramā* visit Māmagāchi. Since Śrī Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura inaugurated the *navadvīpa-parikramā* function, the temple has been very well managed.

### Translation

**The twentieth branch of the Caitanya tree was Haridāsa Ṭhākura. His character was wonderful. He used to chant the holy name of Kṛṣṇa 300,000 times a day without fail.**

### Purport

Certainly the chanting of 300,000 holy names of the Lord is wonderful. No ordinary person can chant so many names, nor should one artificially imitate Haridāsa Ṭhākura’s behavior. It is essential, however, that everyone fulfill a specific vow to chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra.* Therefore we have prescribed in our Society that all our students must chant at least sixteen rounds daily. Such chanting must be offenseless in order to be of high quality. Mechanical chanting is not as powerful as chanting of the holy name without offenses. It is stated in the *Caitanya-bhāgavata, Ādi-khaṇḍa,* chapter two, that Haridāsa Ṭhākura was born in a village known as Buḍhana but after some time came to live on the bank of the Ganges at Phuliyā, near Śāntipura. From the description of his chastisement by a Muslim magistrate, which is found in the sixteenth chapter of the *Ādi-khaṇḍa* of *Caitanya-bhāgavata,* we can understand how humble and meek Haridāsa Ṭhākura was and how he achieved the causeless mercy of the Lord. In the dramas performed by Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Haridāsa Ṭhākura played the part of a police chief. While chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra* in Benāpola, he was personally tested by Māyādevī herself. Haridāsa Ṭhākura’s passing away is described in the *Antya-līlā* of *Caitanya-caritāmṛta,* eleventh chapter. It is not definitely certain whether Śrī Haridāsa Ṭhākura appeared in the village named Buḍhana that is in the district of Khulnā. Formerly this village was within a district of twenty-four *pargaṇas* within the Sātakṣīrā division.

### Translation

**One subbranch of Haridāsa Ṭhākura consisted of the residents of Kulīna-grāma. The most important among them was Satyarāja Khān, or Satyarāja Vasu, who was a recipient of all the mercy of Haridāsa Ṭhākura.**

### Purport

Satyarāja Khān was the son of Guṇarāja Khān and father of Rāmānanda Vasu. Haridāsa Ṭhākura lived for some time during the Cāturmāsya period in the village named Kulīna-grāma, where he chanted the holy name, the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra,* and distributed his mercy to the descendants of the Vasu family. Satyarāja Khān was allotted the service of supplying silk ropes for the Jagannātha Deity during the Ratha-yātrā festival. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s answers to his inquiries about the duty of householder devotees are vividly described in the *Madhya-līlā,* chapters fifteen and sixteen.

The village of Kulīna-grāma is situated two miles from the railway station named Jaugrāma on the Newcord line from Howrah to Burdwan. Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu very highly praised the people of Kulīna-grāma, and He stated that even a dog of Kulīna-grāma was very dear to Him.

### Translation

**Murāri Gupta, the twenty-first branch of the tree of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, was a storehouse of love of Godhead. His great humility and meekness melted the heart of Lord Caitanya.**

### Purport

Śrī Murāri Gupta wrote a book called *Śrī Caitanya-carita.* He belonged to a *vaidya* physician family of Śrīhaṭṭa, the paternal home of Lord Caitanya, and later became a resident of Navadvīpa. He was among the elders of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Lord Caitanya exhibited His Varāha form in the house of Murāri Gupta, as described in the *Caitanya-bhāgavata, Madhya-khaṇḍa,* third chapter. When Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu exhibited His *mahā-prakāśa* form, He appeared before Murāri Gupta as Lord Rāmacandra. When Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and Nityānanda Prabhu were sitting together in the house of Śrīvāsa Ṭhākura, Murāri Gupta first offered his respects to Lord Caitanya and then to Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu. Nityānanda Prabhu, however, was older than Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and therefore Lord Caitanya remarked that Murāri Gupta had violated social etiquette, for he should have first shown respect to Nityānanda Prabhu and then to Him. In this way, by the grace of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Murāri Gupta was informed about the position of Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu, and the next day he offered obeisances first to Lord Nityānanda and then to Lord Caitanya. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu gave chewed pan, or betel nut, to Murāri Gupta. Once Śivānanda Sena offered food to Lord Caitanya that had been cooked with excessive ghee, and the next day the Lord became sick and went to Murāri Gupta for treatment. Lord Caitanya accepted some water from the waterpot of Murāri Gupta, and thus He was cured. The natural remedy for indigestion is to drink a little water, and since Murāri Gupta was a physician, he gave the Lord some drinking water and cured Him.

When Caitanya Mahāprabhu appeared in the house of Śrīvāsa Ṭhākura in His Caturbhuja *mūrti,* Murāri Gupta became His carrier in the form of Garuḍa, and in these pastimes of ecstasy the Lord then got up on his back. It was the desire of Murāri Gupta to leave his body before the disappearance of Caitanya Mahāprabhu, but the Lord forbade him to do so. This is described in the *Caitanya-bhāgavata, Madhya-khaṇḍa,* chapter twenty. When Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu one day appeared in ecstasy as the Varāha *mūrti,* Murāri Gupta offered Him prayers. He was a great devotee of Lord Rāmacandra, and his staunch devotion is vividly described in the *Caitanya-caritāmṛta, Madhya-līlā,* fifteenth chapter, verses 137 through 157.

*pratigraha nāhi kare, nā laya kāra dhana  
ātma-vṛtti kari’ kare kuṭumba bharaṇa*

### Synonyms

*pratigraha* *nāhi* *kare* — he did not accept charity from anyone; *nā* — not; *laya* — take; *kāra* — anyone’s; *dhana* — wealth; *ātma*-*vṛtti* — own profession; *kari’* — executing; *kare* — maintained; *kuṭumba* — family; *bharaṇa* — provision.

### Translation

**Śrīla Murāri Gupta never accepted charity from friends, nor did he accept money from anyone. He practiced as a physician and maintained his family with his earnings.**

### Purport

It should be noted that a *gṛhastha* (householder) must not make his livelihood by begging from anyone. Every householder of the higher castes should engage himself in his own occupational duty as a *brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya* or *vaiśya,* but he should not engage in the service of others, for this is the duty of a *śūdra.* One should simply accept whatever he earns by his own profession. The engagements of a *brāhmaṇa* are *yajana, yājana, paṭhana, pāṭhana, dāna* and *pratigraha.* A *brāhmaṇa* should be a worshiper of Viṣṇu, and he should also instruct others how to worship Him. A *kṣatriya* can become a landholder and earn his livelihood by levying taxes or collecting rent from tenants. A *vaiśya* can accept agriculture or general trade as an occupational duty. Since Murāri Gupta was born in a physician’s family (*vaidya-vaṁśa*), he practiced as a physician, and with whatever income he earned he maintained his family. As stated in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,* everyone should try to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead through the execution of his occupational duty. That is the perfection of life. This system is called *daivī-varṇāśrama.* Murāri Gupta was an ideal *gṛhastha,* for he was a great devotee of Lord Rāmacandra and Caitanya Mahāprabhu. By practicing as a physician he maintained his family and at the same time satisfied Lord Caitanya to the best of his ability. This is the ideal of householder life.

### Translation

**As Murāri Gupta treated his patients, by his mercy both their bodily and spiritual diseases subsided.**

### Purport

Murāri Gupta could treat both bodily and spiritual disease because he was a physician by profession and a great devotee of the Lord in terms of spiritual advancement. This is an example of service to humanity. Everyone should know that there are two kinds of diseases in human society. One disease, which is called *adhyātmika,* or material disease, pertains to the body, but the main disease is spiritual. The living entity is eternal, but somehow or other, when in contact with the material energy, he is subjected to the repetition of birth, death, old age and disease. The physicians of the modern day should learn from Murāri Gupta. Although modern philanthropic physicians open gigantic hospitals, there are no hospitals to cure the material disease of the spirit soul. The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement has taken up the mission of curing this disease, but people are not very appreciative because they do not know what this disease is. A diseased person needs both proper medicine and a proper diet, and therefore the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement supplies materially stricken people with the medicine of the chanting of the holy name, or the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra,* and the diet of *prasādam.* There are many hospitals and medical clinics to cure bodily diseases, but there are no such hospitals to cure the material disease of the spirit soul. The centers of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement are the only established hospitals that can cure man of birth, death, old age and disease.

### Translation

**Śrī Gadādhara dāsa, the twenty-third branch, was understood to be the topmost, for he induced all the Muslim Kazis to chant the holy name of Lord Hari.**

### Purport

About eight or ten miles from Calcutta, on the banks of the Ganges, is a village known as Eṅḍiyādaha-grāma. Śrīla Gadādhara dāsa was known as an inhabitant of this village (*eṅḍiyādaha-vāsī gadādhara dāsa*)*.* The *Bhakti-ratnākara* (Seventh Wave), informs us that after the disappearance of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Gadādhara dāsa went from Navadvīpa to Katwa. Thereafter he came to Eṅḍiyādaha and resided there. He is stated to be the luster of the body of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī, just as Śrīla Gadādhara Paṇḍita Gosvāmī is an incarnation of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī Herself. Caitanya Mahāprabhu is sometimes explained to be *rādhā-bhāva-dyuti-suvalita,* or characterized by the emotions and bodily luster of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī. Gadādhara dāsa is this *dyuti,* or luster. In the *Gaura-gaṇoddeśa-dīpikā* (154) he is described to be an expansion of the potency of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī. He counts among the associates of both Śrīla Gaurahari and Nityānanda Prabhu; as a devotee of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu he was one of the associates of Lord Kṛṣṇa in conjugal love, and as a devotee of Lord Nityānanda he is considered to have been one of the friends of Kṛṣṇa in pure devotional service. Even though he was an associate of Lord Nityānanda Prabhu, he was not among the cowherd boys but was situated in the transcendental mellow of conjugal love. He established a temple of Śrī Gaurasundara in Katwa.

In 1434 Śakābda (A.D. 1512), when Lord Nityānanda Prabhu was empowered by Lord Caitanya to preach the *saṅkīrtana* movement in Bengal, Śrī Gadādhara dāsa was one of Lord Nityānanda’s chief assistants. He preached the *saṅkīrtana* movement by requesting everyone to chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra.* This simple preaching method of Śrīla Gadādhara dāsa can be followed by anyone and everyone in any position of society. One must simply be a sincere and serious servant of Nityānanda Prabhu and preach this cult door to door.

When Śrīla Gadādhara dāsa Prabhu was preaching the cult of *hari-kīrtana,* there was a magistrate who was very much against his *saṅkīrtana* movement. Following in the footsteps of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Śrīla Gadādhara dāsa one night went to the house of the Kazi and requested him to chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra.* The Kazi replied, “All right, I shall chant Hare Kṛṣṇa tomorrow.” On hearing this, Śrīla Gadādhara dāsa Prabhu began to dance, and he said, “Why tomorrow? You have already chanted the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra,* so simply continue.”

In the *Gaura-gaṇoddeśa-dīpikā* (verses 154-55) it is said:

*rādhā-vibhūti-rūpā yā* *candrakāntiḥ purā vraje  
sa śrī-gaurāṅga-nikaṭe* *dāsa-vaṁśyo gadādharaḥ*

*pūrṇānandā vraje yāsīd* *baladeva-priyāgraṇī  
sāpi kārya-vaśād eva* *prāviśat taṁ gadādharam*

Śrīla Gadādhara dāsa is considered to be a united form of Candrakānti, who is the effulgence of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī, and Pūrṇānandā, who is the foremost of Lord Balarāma’s very dear girlfriends. Thus Śrīla Gadādhara dāsa Prabhu was one of the associates of both Caitanya Mahāprabhu and Nityānanda Prabhu.

Once while Śrīla Gadādhara dāsa Prabhu was returning to Bengal from Jagannātha Purī with Nityānanda Prabhu, he forgot himself and began talking very loudly as if he were a girl of Vrajabhūmi selling yogurt, and Śrīla Nityānanda Prabhu noted this. Another time, while absorbed in the ecstasy of the *gopīs,* he carried a jug filled with Ganges water on his head as if he were selling milk. When Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu appeared in the house of Rāghava Paṇḍita while going to Vṛndāvana, Gadādhara dāsa went to see Him, and Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was so glad that He put His foot on his head. When Gadādhara dāsa Prabhu was present in Eṅḍiyādaha, he established a Bāla Gopāla *mūrti* for worship there. Śrī Mādhava Ghoṣa performed a drama known as *Dāna-khaṇḍa* with the help of Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu and Śrī Gadādhara dāsa. This is explained in the *Caitanya-bhāgavata* (*Antya* 5.318-94).

The tomb of Gadādhara dāsa Prabhu, which is in the village of Eṅḍiyādaha, was under the control of the Saṁyogī Vaiṣṇavas and later under the direction of Siddha Bhagavān dāsa Bābājī of Kālnā. By his order, Śrī Madhusūdana Mullik, one of the members of the aristocratic Mullik family of the Nārikelaḍāṅgā in Calcutta, established a *pāṭhabāḍī* (monastery) there in the Bengali year 1256 (A.D. 1849). He also arranged for the worship of a Deity named Śrī Rādhākānta. His son Balāicāṅda Mullik established Gaura-Nitāi Deities there in the Bengali year 1312 (A.D. 1905). Thus on the throne of the temple are both Gaura-Nityānanda Deities and Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa Deities. Below the throne is a tablet with an inscription written in Sanskrit. In that temple there is also a small Deity of Lord Śiva as Gopeśvara. This is all described on a stone by the side of the entrance door.

### Purport

The *sākṣāt* feature of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is His personal presence. *Āveśa* refers to invested power, like that invested in Nakula Brahmacārī. *Āvirbhāva* is a manifestation of the Lord that appears even though He is personally not present. For example, Śrī Śacīmātā offered food at home to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu although He was far away in Jagannātha Purī, and when she opened her eyes after offering the food, she saw that it had actually been eaten by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Similarly, when Śrīvāsa Ṭhākura performed *saṅkīrtana,* everyone felt the presence of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, even in His absence. This is another example of *āvirbhāva.*

**In his body there were symptoms of āvirbhāva. Such appearances are uncommon, but Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu displayed many such pastimes through His different features.**

### Purport

In the *Gaura-gaṇoddeśa-dīpikā* (73-74) it is said that Nakula Brahmacārī displayed the prowess (*āveśa*) and Pradyumna Brahmacārī the appearance (*āvirbhāva*) of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. There are many hundreds and thousands of devotees of Lord Caitanya among whom there are no special symptoms, but when a devotee of Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu functions with specific prowess, he displays the feature called *āveśa.* Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu personally spread the *saṅkīrtana* movement, and He advised all the inhabitants of Bhāratavarṣa to take up His cult and preach it all over the world. The visible bodily symptoms of devotees who follow such instructions are called *āveśa.* Śrīla Śivānanda Sena observed such *āveśa* symptoms in Nakula Brahmacārī, who displayed symptoms exactly like those of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. The *Caitanya-caritāmṛta* states that in the Age of Kali the only spiritual function is to broadcast the holy name of the Lord, but this function can be performed only by one who is actually empowered by Lord Kṛṣṇa. The process by which a devotee is thus empowered is called *āveśa,* or sometimes it is called *śakty-āveśa.*

Pradyumna Brahmacārī was formerly a resident of a village known as Piyārīgañja in Kālnā. There is a description of him in the *Antya-līlā* of *Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta,* second chapter, and in the *Antya-khaṇḍa* of *Śrī Caitanya-bhāgavata,* chapters three and nine.

### Purport

Śrīla Śivānanda Sena has been described by Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Mahārāja as follows: “Śivānanda Sena was a resident of Kumārahaṭṭa, which is also known as Hālisahara, and was a great devotee of the Lord. About one and a half miles from Kumārahaṭṭa is another village, known as Kāṅcaḍāpāḍā, in which there are Gaura-Gopāla Deities installed by Śivānanda Sena, who also established a temple of Kṛṣṇarāya that is still existing. Śivānanda Sena was the father of Paramānanda Sena, who was also known as Purī dāsa or Kavi-karṇapūra. Paramānanda Sena wrote in his *Gaura-gaṇoddeśa-dīpikā* (176) that two of the *gopīs* of Vṛndāvana, whose former names were Vīrā and Dūtī, combined to become his father. Śrīla Śivānanda Sena guided all the devotees of Lord Caitanya who went from Bengal to Jagannātha Purī, and he personally bore all the expenses for their journey. This is described in the *Caitanya-caritāmṛta, Madhya-līlā,* chapter sixteen, verses 19 through 27. Śrīla Śivānanda Sena had three sons, named Caitanya dāsa, Rāmadāsa and Paramānanda. As mentioned above, this last son later became Kavi-karṇapūra and wrote the *Gaura-gaṇoddeśa-dīpikā.* His spiritual master was Śrīnātha Paṇḍita, who was Śivānanda Sena’s priest. Due to Vāsudeva Datta’s lavish spending, Śivānanda Sena was engaged to supervise his expenditures.”

Śrī Śivānanda Sena actually experienced Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s features of *sākṣāt, āveśa* and *āvirbhāva.* He once took along a dog while on his way to Jagannātha Purī, and it is described in the *Antya-līlā,* first chapter, that this dog later attained salvation by his association. When Śrīla Raghunātha dāsa, who later became Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī, fled his paternal home to join Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, his father wrote a letter to Śivānanda Sena to get information about him. Śivānanda Sena supplied him the details for which he asked, and later Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī’s father sent some servants and money to Śivānanda Sena to take care of Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī. Once Śrī Śivānanda Sena invited Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu to his home and fed Him so sumptuously that the Lord felt indigestion and was somewhat sick. This became known to Śivānanda Sena’s eldest son, Caitanya dāsa, who gave the Lord the kinds of food that would help His digestion, and thus Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu was very pleased. This is described in *Antya-līlā,* tenth chapter, verses 142 through 151.

Once while going to Jagannātha Purī, all the devotees had to stay underneath a tree, without the shelter of a house or even a shed, and Nityānanda Prabhu became very angry, as if He were greatly disturbed by hunger. Thus He cursed Śivānanda’s sons to die. Śivānanda’s wife was very much aggrieved at this, and she began to cry. She very seriously thought that since her sons had been cursed by Nityānanda Prabhu, certainly they would die. When Śivānanda later returned and saw his wife crying, he said, “Why are you crying? Let us all die if Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu desires.” When Śivānanda Sena returned and Śrīla Nityānanda Prabhu saw him, the Lord kicked him severely, complaining that He was very hungry, and asked why he had not arranged for His food. Such is the behavior of the Lord with His devotees. Śrīla Nityānanda Prabhu behaved like an ordinary hungry man, as if completely dependent on the arrangements of Śivānanda Sena.

A nephew of Śivānanda Sena’s named Śrīkānta left the company in protest of Nityānanda Prabhu’s curse and went directly to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu at Jagannātha Purī, where the Lord pacified him. On that occasion, Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu allowed His toe to be sucked by Purī dāsa, who was then a child. It is by the order of Caitanya Mahāprabhu that he could immediately compose Sanskrit verses. During the misunderstanding with Śivānanda’s family, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu ordered His personal attendant, Govinda, to give them all the remnants of His food. This is described in *Antya-līlā,* chapter twelve, verse 53.

Caitanya dāsa, the eldest son of Śivānanda Sena, wrote a commentary on *Kṛṣṇa-karṇāmṛta* that was later translated by Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura in his paper *Sajjana-toṣaṇī.* According to expert opinion, Caitanya dāsa was the author of the book *Caitanya-carita* (also known as *Caitanya-caritāmṛta*), which was written in Sanskrit. The author was not Kavi-karṇapūra, as is generally supposed. This is the opinion of Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura. Śrī Rāmadāsa was the second son of Śivānanda Sena. It is stated in the *Gaura-gaṇoddeśa-dīpikā* (145) that the two famous parrots named Dakṣa and Vicakṣaṇa in *kṛṣṇa-līlā* became the elder brothers of Kavi-karṇapūra, namely Caitanya dāsa and Rāmadāsa. Karṇapūra, the third son, who was also known as Paramānanda dāsa or Purī dāsa, was initiated by Śrīnātha Paṇḍita, who was a disciple of Śrī Advaita Prabhu. Karṇapūra wrote many books that are important in Vaiṣṇava literature, such as the *Ānanda-vṛndāvana-campū, Alaṅkāra-kaustubha, Gaura-gaṇoddeśa-dīpikā* and the great epic *Caitanya-candrodaya-nāṭaka.* He was born in the year 1448 Śakābda (A.D. 1526). He continually wrote books for ten years, from 1488 until 1498.

When Lord Nityānanda Prabhu rebuked Śivānanda Sena on the way to Purī, these two nephews of Śivānanda left the company as a protest and went to see Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu at Jagannātha Purī. The Lord could understand the feelings of the boys, and He asked His personal assistant, Govinda, to supply them *prasādam* until the party of Śivānanda arrived. During the Ratha-yātrā *saṅkīrtana* festival these two brothers were members of the party led by Mukunda. In the *Gaura-gaṇoddeśa-dīpikā* (174) it is said that the *gopī* whose name was Kātyāyanī appeared as Śrīkānta Sena.

Śrīdhara was a poor *brāhmaṇa* who made a living by selling banana-tree bark to be made into cups. Most probably he had a banana-tree garden and collected the leaves, skin and pulp of the banana trees to sell daily in the market. He spent fifty percent of his income to worship the Ganges, and the balance he used for his subsistence. When Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu started His civil disobedience movement in defiance of the Kazi, Śrīdhara danced in jubilation. The Lord used to drink water from his water jug. Śrīdhara presented a squash to Śacīdevī to cook before Lord Caitanya took *sannyāsa.* Every year he went to see Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu at Jagannātha Purī. According to Kavi-karṇapūra, Śrīdhara was a cowherd boy of Vṛndāvana whose name was Kusumāsava. In his *Gaura-gaṇoddeśa-dīpikā* (133) it is stated:

*kholā-vecātayā khyātaḥ* *paṇḍitaḥ śrīdharo dvijaḥ

### Purport

In the *Caitanya-bhāgavata, Madhya-khaṇḍa,* chapter twenty-one, it is stated that Devānanda Paṇḍita and Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya’s father, Viśārada, lived in the same village. Devānanda Paṇḍita was a professional reciter of *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,* but Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu did not like his interpretation of it. In the present town of Navadvīpa, which was formerly known as Kuliyā, Lord Caitanya showed such mercy to him that he gave up the Māyāvādī interpretation of *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* and learned how to explain *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* in terms of *bhakti.* Formerly, when Devānanda was expounding the Māyāvādī interpretation, Śrīvāsa Ṭhākura was once present in his meeting, and when he began to cry, Devānanda’s students drove him away. Some days later, Caitanya Mahāprabhu passed that way, and when He met Devānanda He chastised him severely because of his Māyāvāda interpretation of *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.* At that time Devānanda had little faith in Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu as an incarnation of Lord Kṛṣṇa, but one night some time later Vakreśvara Paṇḍita was a guest in his house, and when he explained the science of Kṛṣṇa, Devānanda was convinced about the identity of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Thus he was induced to explain *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* according to the Vaiṣṇava understanding. In the *Gaura-gaṇoddeśa-dīpikā* (106) it is described that he was formerly Bhāguri Muni, the *sabhā-paṇḍita* who recited Vedic literatures in the house of Nanda Mahārāja.

### Purport

Śrī Mukunda dāsa was the son of Nārāyaṇa dāsa and eldest brother of Narahari Sarakāra. His second brother’s name was Mādhava dāsa, and his son was named Raghunandana dāsa. Descendants of Raghunandana dāsa still live four miles west of Katwa in the village named Śrīkhaṇḍa, where Raghunandana dāsa used to live. Raghunandana had one son named Kānāi, who had two sons — Madana Rāya, who was a disciple of Narahari Ṭhākura, and Vaṁśīvadana. It is estimated that at least four hundred men descended in this dynasty. All their names are recorded in the village of Śrīkhaṇḍa. In the *Gaura-gaṇoddeśa-dīpikā* (175) it is stated that the *gopī* whose name was Vṛndādevī became Mukunda dāsa, lived in Śrīkhaṇḍa village and was very dear to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. His wonderful devotion and love for Kṛṣṇa are described in the *Caitanya-caritāmṛta, Madhya-līlā,* chapter fifteen. It is stated in the *Bhakti-ratnākara* (Eighth Wave) that Raghunandana used to serve a Deity of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

Narahari dāsa Sarakāra was a very famous devotee. Locana dāsa Ṭhākura, the celebrated author of *Śrī Caitanya-maṅgala,* was his disciple. In the *Caitanya-maṅgala* it is stated that Śrī Gadādhara dāsa and Narahari Sarakāra were extremely dear to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, but there is no specific statement regarding the inhabitants of the village of Śrīkhaṇḍa.

Cirañjīva and Sulocana were both residents of Śrīkhaṇḍa, where their descendants are still living. Of Cirañjīva’s two sons, the elder, Rāmacandra Kavirāja, was a disciple of Śrīnivāsa Acārya and an intimate associate of Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura. The younger son was Govinda dāsa Kavirāja, the famous Vaiṣṇava poet. Cirañjīva’s wife was Sunandā, and his father-in-law was Dāmodara Sena Kavirāja. Cirañjīva previously lived on the bank of the Ganges River, in the village of Kumāranagara. The *Gaura-gaṇoddeśa-dīpikā* (207) states that he was formerly Candrikā in Vṛndāvana.

*anupama-vallabha, śrī-rūpa, sanātana

### Synonyms

*anupama*-*vallabha* — Anupama, or Vallabha; *śrī*-*rūpa* — Śrī Rūpa; *sanātana* — Sanātana; *ei* — these; *tina* — three; *śākhā* — branches; *vṛkṣera* — of the tree; *paścime* — on the western side; *sarvottama* — very great.

### Translation

**On the western side were the forty-third, forty-fourth and forty-fifth branches — Śrī Sanātana, Śrī Rūpa and Anupama. They were the best of all.**

### Purport

Śrī Anupama was the father of Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī and younger brother of Śrī Sanātana Gosvāmī and Śrī Rūpa Gosvāmī. His former name was Vallabha, but after Lord Caitanya met him He gave him the name Anupama. Because of working in the Muslim government, these three brothers were given the title Mullik. Our personal family is connected with the Mulliks of Mahatma Gandhi Road in Calcutta, and we often used to visit their Rādhā-Govinda temple. They belong to the same family as we do. Our family *gotra,* or original genealogical line, is the Gautama-gotra, or line of disciples of Gautama Muni, and our surname is De. But due to their accepting the posts of zamindars in the Muslim government, they received the title Mullik. Similarly, Rūpa, Sanātana and Vallabha were also given the title Mullik. Mullik means “lord.” Just as the English government gives rich and respectable persons the title “lord,” so the Muslims give the title Mullik to rich, respectable families that have intimate connections with the government. Thus the title Mullik is found not only among the Muslims but also among the Hindu aristocracy. This title is not restricted to a particular family but is given to different families and castes. The qualifications for receiving it are wealth and respectability.

Sanātana Gosvāmī and Rūpa Gosvāmī belonged to the Bharadvāja-gotra, which indicates that they belonged either to the family or disciplic succession of Bharadvāja Muni. As members of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement we belong to the family, or disciplic succession, of Sarasvatī Gosvāmī, and thus we are known as Sārasvatas. Obeisances are therefore offered to the spiritual master as *sārasvata-deva,* or a member of the Sārasvata family (*namas te sārasvate deve*), whose mission is to broadcast the cult of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu (*gaura-vāṇī-pracāriṇe*) and to fight with impersonalists and voidists (*nirviśeṣa-śūnyavādi-pāścātya-deśa-tāriṇe*)*.* This was also the occupational duty of Sanātana Gosvāmī, Rūpa Gosvāmī and Anupama Gosvāmī.

The genealogical table of Sanātana Gosvāmī, Rūpa Gosvāmī and Vallabha Gosvāmī can be traced back to the twelfth century Śakābda, when a gentleman of the name Sarvajña appeared in a very rich and opulent *brāhmaṇa* family in the province of Karṇāṭa. He had two sons, named Aniruddhera Rūpeśvara and Harihara, who were both bereft of their kingdoms and thus obliged to reside in the highlands. The son of Rūpeśvara, who was named Padmanābha, moved to a place in Bengal known as Naihāṭī, on the bank of the Ganges. There he had five sons, of whom the youngest, Mukunda, had a well-behaved son named Kumāradeva, who was the father of Rūpa, Sanātana and Vallabha. Kumāradeva lived in Phateyābād (Fateyabad), an area bordering Bāklācandradvīpa in East Bengal (now Bangladesh). The present-day village of Prembagh, which lies near Ramshara in the Jessore district of Bangladesh, is said by many to be the site of Kumāradeva’s house. Of his many sons, three took to the path of Vaiṣṇavism. Later, Śrī Vallabha and his elder brothers Śrī Rūpa and Sanātana came from Candradvīpa to the village in the Maldah district of Bengal known as Rāmakeli. It is in this village that Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī took birth, accepting Vallabha as his father. Because of engaging in the service of the Muslim government, the three brothers received the title Mullik. When Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu visited the village of Rāmakeli, He met Vallabha there. Later, Śrī Rūpa Gosvāmī, after meeting Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, resigned from government service, and when he went to Vṛndāvana to meet Lord Caitanya, Vallabha accompanied him. The meeting of Rūpa Gosvāmī and Vallabha with Caitanya Mahāprabhu at Allahabad is described in the *Madhya-līlā,* chapter nineteen.

Actually, it is to be understood from the statement of Sanātana Gosvāmī that Śrī Rūpa Gosvāmī and Vallabha went to Vṛndāvana under the instructions of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. First they went to Mathurā, where they met a gentleman named Subuddhi Rāya, who maintained himself by selling dry fuel wood. He was very pleased to meet Śrī Rūpa Gosvāmī and Anupama, and he showed them the twelve forests of Vṛndāvana. Thus they lived in Vṛndāvana for one month and then again went to search for Sanātana Gosvāmī. Following the course of the Ganges, they reached Allahabad, or Prayāga-tīrtha, but because Sanātana Gosvāmī had come there by a different road, they did not meet him there, and when Sanātana Gosvāmī came to Mathurā he was informed of the visit of Rūpa Gosvāmī and Anupama by Subuddhi Rāya. When Rūpa Gosvāmī and Anupama met Caitanya Mahāprabhu at Benares, they heard about Sanātana Gosvāmī’s travels from Him, and thus they returned to Bengal, adjusted their affairs with the state and, on the order of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, went to see the Lord at Jagannātha Purī.

In the year 1436 Śakābda (A.D. 1514), the youngest brother, Anupama, died and went back home, back to Godhead. He went to the abode in the spiritual sky where Śrī Rāmacandra is situated. At Jagannātha Purī, Śrī Rūpa Gosvāmī informed Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu of this incident. Vallabha was a great devotee of Śrī Rāmacandra; therefore he could not seriously consider the worship of Rādhā-Govinda according to the instructions of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Yet he directly accepted Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu as an incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Rāmacandra. In the *Bhakti-ratnākara* there is the following statement: “Vallabha was given the name Anupama by Śrī Gaurasundara, but he was always absorbed in the devotional service of Lord Rāmacandra. He did not know anyone but Śrī Rāmacandra, but he knew that Caitanya Gosāñi was the same Lord Rāmacandra.”

In the *Gaura-gaṇoddeśa-dīpikā* (180) Śrī Rūpa Gosvāmī is described to be the *gopī* named Śrī Rūpa-mañjarī. In the *Bhakti-ratnākara* there is a list of the books Śrī Rūpa Gosvāmī compiled. Of all his books, the following sixteen are very popular among Vaiṣṇavas: (1) *Haṁsadūta,* (2) *Uddhava-sandeśa,* (3) *Kṛṣṇa-janma-tithi-vidhi,* (4 and 5) *Rādhā-kṛṣṇa-gaṇoddeśa-dīpikā, Bṛhat* (major) and *Laghu* (minor), (6) *Stavamālā,* (7) *Vidagdha-mādhava,* (8) *Lalita-mādhava,* (9) *Dāna-kelikaumudi,* (10) *Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu* (this is the most celebrated book by Śrī Rūpa Gosvāmī), (11) *Ujjvala-nīlamaṇi,* (12) *Ākhyāta-candrikā,* (13) *Mathurā-mahimā,* (14) *Padyāvalī,* (15) *Nāṭaka-candrikā* and (16) *Laghu-bhāgavatāmṛta.* Śrī Rūpa Gosvāmī gave up all family connections, joined the renounced order of life and divided his money, giving fifty percent to the *brāhmaṇas* and Vaiṣṇavas and twenty-five percent to his *kuṭumba* (family members), and keeping twenty-five percent for personal emergencies. He met Haridāsa Ṭhākura in Jagannātha Purī, where he also met Lord Caitanya and His other associates. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu used to praise the handwriting of Rūpa Gosvāmī. Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī could compose verses according to the desires of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and by His direction he wrote two books named *Lalita-mādhava* and *Vidagdha-mādhava.* Lord Caitanya desired the two brothers, Sanātana Gosvāmī and Rūpa Gosvāmī, to publish many books in support of the Vaiṣṇava religion. When Sanātana Gosvāmī met Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, the Lord advised him also to go to Vṛndāvana.

Śrī Sanātana Gosvāmī is described in the *Gaura-gaṇoddeśa-dīpikā* (181). He was formerly known as Rati-mañjarī or sometimes Lavaṅga-mañjarī. In the *Bhakti-ratnākara* it is stated that his spiritual master, Vidyā-vācaspati, sometimes stayed in the village of Rāmakeli, and Sanātana Gosvāmī studied all the Vedic literatures from him. He was so devoted to his spiritual master that this cannot be described. According to the Vedic system, if someone sees a Muslim he must perform rituals to atone for the meeting. Sanātana Gosvāmī always associated with Muslim kings. Not giving much attention to the Vedic injunctions, he used to visit the houses of Muslim kings, and thus he considered himself to have been converted into a Muslim. He was therefore always very humble and meek. When Sanātana Gosvāmī presented himself before Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, he said, “I am always in association with lower-class people, and my behavior is therefore very abominable.” He actually belonged to a respectable *brāhmaṇa* family, but because he considered his behavior to be abominable, he did not try to place himself among the *brāhmaṇas* but always remained among people of the lower castes. He wrote the *Hari-bhakti-vilāsa* and *Vaiṣṇava-toṣaṇī,* which is a commentary on the Tenth Canto of *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.* In the year 1476 Śakābda (A.D. 1554) he completed the *Bṛhad-vaiṣṇava-toṣaṇī* commentary on *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.* In the year 1504 Śakābda (A.D. 1582) Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī published an edited version of the *Bṛhad-vaiṣṇava-toṣaṇī* named *Laghu-toṣaṇī.*

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu taught His principles through four chief followers. Among them, Rāmānanda Rāya is exceptional, for through him the Lord taught how a devotee can completely vanquish the power of Cupid. By Cupid’s power, as soon as one sees a beautiful woman he is conquered by her beauty. Śrī Rāmānanda Rāya, however, vanquished Cupid’s pride. Indeed, while rehearsing the *Jagannātha-vallabha-nāṭaka* he personally directed extremely beautiful young girls in dancing, but he was never affected by their youthful beauty. Śrī Rāmānanda Rāya personally bathed these girls, touching them and washing them with his own hands, yet he remained calm and passionless, as a great devotee should be. Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu certified that this was possible only for Rāmānanda Rāya. Similarly, Dāmodara Paṇḍita was notable for his objectivity as a critic. He did not even spare Caitanya Mahāprabhu from his criticism. This also cannot be imitated by anyone else. Haridāsa Ṭhākura is exceptional for his forbearance because although he was beaten with canes in twenty-two marketplaces, he was nevertheless tolerant. Similarly, Śrī Sanātana Gosvāmī, although he belonged to a most respectable *brāhmaṇa* family, was exceptional for his humility and meekness.

In the *Madhya-līlā,* chapter nineteen, the device adopted by Sanātana Gosvāmī to get free from government service is described. He served a notice of sickness to the Nawab, the Muslim governor, but actually he was studying *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* with *brāhmaṇas* at home. The Nawab received information of this through a royal physician, and he immediately went to see Sanātana Gosvāmī to discover his intentions. The Nawab requested Sanātana to accompany him on an expedition to Orissa, but when Sanātana Gosvāmī refused, the Nawab ordered that he be imprisoned. When Rūpa Gosvāmī left home, he wrote a note for Sanātana Gosvāmī informing him of some money that he had entrusted to a local grocer. Sanātana Gosvāmī took advantage of this money to bribe the jail keeper and get free from detention. Then he left for Benares to meet Caitanya Mahāprabhu, bringing with him only one servant, whose name was Īśāna. On the way they stopped at a *sarāi,* or hotel, and when the hotel keeper found out that Īśāna had some gold coins with him, he planned to kill both Sanātana Gosvāmī and Īśāna to take away the coins. Later Sanātana Gosvāmī saw that although the hotel keeper did not know them, he was being especially attentive to their comfort. Therefore he concluded that Īśāna was secretly carrying some money and that the hotel keeper was aware of this and therefore planned to kill them for it. Upon being questioned by Sanātana Gosvāmī, Īśāna admitted that he indeed had money with him, and immediately Sanātana Gosvāmī took the money and gave it to the hotel keeper, requesting him to help them get through the jungle. Thus with the help of the hotel keeper, who was also the chief of the thieves of that territory, Sanātana Gosvāmī crossed over the Hazipur mountains, which are presently known as the Hazaribags. He then met his brother-in-law Śrīkānta, who requested that he stay with him. Sanātana Gosvāmī refused, but before they parted Śrīkānta gave him a valuable blanket.

Somehow or other Sanātana Gosvāmī reached Vārāṇasī and met Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu at the house of Candraśekhara. By the order of the Lord, Sanātana Gosvāmī was cleanly shaved and his dress changed to that of a mendicant, or *bābājī.* He put on old garments of Tapana Miśra’s and took *prasādam* at the house of a Maharashtrian *brāhmaṇa.* Then, in discourses with Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, the Lord Himself explained everything about devotional service to Sanātana Gosvāmī. He advised Sanātana Gosvāmī to write books on devotional service, including a book of directions for Vaiṣṇava activities, and to excavate the lost places of pilgrimage in Vṛndāvana. Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu gave him His blessings to do all this work and also explained to Sanātana Gosvāmī the import of the *ātmārāma* verse from sixty-one different angles of vision.

Sanātana Gosvāmī went to Vṛndāvana by the main road, and when he reached Mathurā he met Subuddhi Rāya. Then he returned to Jagannātha Purī through Jhārikhaṇḍa (Jharkhand), the Madhya Pradesh jungle. At Jagannātha Purī he decided to give up his body by falling down beneath a wheel of the Jagannātha *ratha,* but Caitanya Mahāprabhu saved him. Then Sanātana Gosvāmī met Haridāsa Ṭhākura and heard about the disappearance of Anupama. Sanātana Gosvāmī later described the glories of Haridāsa Ṭhākura. Sanātana observed the etiquette of Jagannātha’s temple by going along the beach to visit Lord Caitanya, although it was extremely hot due to the sun. He requested Jagadānanda Paṇḍita to give him permission to return to Vṛndāvana. Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu praised the character of Sanātana Gosvāmī, and He embraced Sanātana, accepting his body as spiritual. Sanātana Gosvāmī was ordered by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu to live at Jagannātha Purī for one year. When he returned to Vṛndāvana after that time, he again met Rūpa Gosvāmī, and both brothers remained in Vṛndāvana to execute the orders of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

The place where Śrī Rūpa Gosvāmī and Sanātana Gosvāmī formerly lived has now become a place of pilgrimage. It is generally known as Gupta Vṛndāvana, or hidden Vṛndāvana, and is situated about eight miles south of English Bazaar. There the following places are still visited: (1) the temple of the Śrī Madana-mohana Deity, (2) the Keli-kadamba tree, under which Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu met Sanātana Gosvāmī at night and (3) Rūpasāgara, a large pond excavated by Śrī Rūpa Gosvāmī. A society named Rāmakeli-saṁskāra-samiti was established in 1924 to repair the temple and renovate the pond.

### Purport

In the *Gaura-gaṇoddeśa-dīpikā* (195) it is said that Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī was formerly Vilāsa-mañjarī *gopī.* From his very childhood Jīva Gosvāmī was greatly fond of *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.* He later came to Navadvīpa to study Sanskrit, and, following in the footsteps of Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu, he circumambulated the entire Navadvīpa-dhāma. After visiting Navadvīpa-dhāma he went to Benares to study Sanskrit under Madhusūdana Vācaspati, and after finishing his studies in Benares he went to Vṛndāvana and took shelter of his uncles, Śrī Rūpa and Sanātana. This is described in the *Bhakti-ratnākara.* As far as our information goes, Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī composed and edited at least twenty-five books. They are all very much celebrated, and they are listed as follows: (1) *Hari-nāmāmṛta-vyākaraṇa,* (2) *Sūtra-mālikā,* (3) *Dhātu-saṅgraha,* (4) *Kṛṣṇārcā-dīpikā,* (5) *Gopāla-virudāvalī,* (6) *Rasāmṛta-śeṣa,* (7) *Śrī Mādhava-mahotsava,* (8) *Śrī Saṅkalpa-kalpavṛkṣa,* (9) *Bhāvārtha-sūcaka-campū,* (10) *Gopāla-tāpanī-ṭīkā,* (11) a commentary on the *Brahma-saṁhitā,* (12) a commentary on the *Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu,* (13) a commentary on the *Ujjvala-nīlamaṇi,* (14) a commentary on the *Yogasāra-stava,* (15) a commentary on the *Gāyatrī-mantra,* as described in the *Agni Purāṇa,* (16) a description of the Lord’s lotus feet derived from the *Padma Purāṇa,* (17) a description of the lotus feet of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī, (18) *Gopāla-campū* (in two parts) and (19-25) seven *sandarbhas:* the *Krama-, Tattva-, Bhagavat-, Paramātma-, Kṛṣṇa-, Bhakti-* and *Prīti-sandarbha.* After the disappearance of Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī and Sanātana Gosvāmī in Vṛndāvana, Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī became the *ācārya* of all the Vaiṣṇavas in Bengal, Orissa and the rest of the world, and it is he who used to guide them in their devotional service. In Vṛndāvana he established the Rādhā-Dāmodara temple, where, after retirement, we had the opportunity to live from 1962 until 1965, when we decided to come to the United States of America. When Jīva Gosvāmī was still present, Śrīla Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī compiled his famous *Caitanya-caritāmṛta.* Later, Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī inspired Śrīnivāsa Ācārya, Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura and Duḥkhī Kṛṣṇadāsa to preach Kṛṣṇa consciousness in Bengal. Jīva Gosvāmī was informed that all the manuscripts that had been collected from Vṛndāvana and sent to Bengal for preaching purposes were plundered near Viṣṇupura, in Bengal, but later he received the information that the books had been recovered. Śrī Jīva Gosvāmī awarded the designation Kavirāja to Rāmacandra Sena, a disciple of Śrīnivāsa Ācārya’s, and to Rāmacandra’s younger brother Govinda. While Jīva Gosvāmī was alive, Śrīmatī Jāhnavā-devī, the pleasure potency of Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu, went to Vṛndāvana with a few devotees. Jīva Gosvāmī was very kind to the Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇavas, the Vaiṣṇavas from Bengal. Whoever went to Vṛndāvana he provided with a residence and *prasādam.* His disciple Kṛṣṇadāsa Adhikārī listed all the books of the Gosvāmīs in his diary.

The *sahajiyās* level three accusations against Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī. This is certainly not congenial for the execution of devotional service. The first accusation concerns a materialist who was very proud of his reputation as a great Sanskrit scholar and approached Śrī Rūpa and Sanātana to argue with them about the revealed scriptures. Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī and Sanātana Gosvāmī, not wanting to waste their time, gave him a written statement that he had defeated them in a debate on the revealed scriptures. Taking this paper, the scholar approached Jīva Gosvāmī for a similar certificate of defeat, but Jīva Gosvāmī did not agree to give him one. On the contrary, he argued with him regarding the scriptures and defeated him. Certainly it was right for Jīva Gosvāmī to stop such a dishonest scholar from advertising that he had defeated Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī and Sanātana Gosvāmī, but due to their illiteracy the *sahajiyā* class refer to this incident to accuse Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī of deviating from the principle of humility. They do not know, however, that humility and meekness are appropriate when one’s own honor is insulted but not when Lord Viṣṇu or the *ācāryas* are blasphemed. In such cases one should not be humble and meek but must act. One should follow the example given by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Lord Caitanya says in His *Śikṣāṣṭaka* (3):

*tṛṇād api su-nīcena* *taror iva sahiṣṇunā  
amāninā māna-dena* *kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ*

“One can chant the holy name of the Lord in a humble state of mind, thinking himself lower than the straw in the street. One should be more tolerant than a tree, devoid of all sense of false prestige, and should be ready to offer all respect to others. In such a state of mind one can chant the holy name of the Lord constantly.” Nevertheless, when the Lord was informed that Nityānanda Prabhu was injured by Jagāi and Mādhāi, He immediately went to the spot, angry like fire, wanting to kill them. Thus Lord Caitanya has explained His verse by the example of His own behavior. One should tolerate insults against oneself, but when there is blasphemy committed against superiors such as other Vaiṣṇavas, one should be neither humble nor meek: one must take proper steps to counteract such blasphemy. This is the duty of a servant of a *guru* and Vaiṣṇavas. Anyone who understands the principle of eternal servitude to the *guru* and Vaiṣṇavas will appreciate the action of Śrī Jīva Gosvāmī in connection with the so-called scholar’s victory over his *gurus,* Śrīla Rūpa and Śrīla Sanātana Gosvāmī.

Another story fabricated to defame Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī states that when Śrīla Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī showed him the newly-completed manuscript of *Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta,* Jīva Gosvāmī thought it would hamper his reputation as a big scholar and therefore threw it into a well. Śrīla Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī was greatly shocked, according to this story, and he died immediately. Fortunately a copy of the manuscript of *Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta* had been kept by a person named Mukunda, and therefore later it was possible to publish the book. This story is another ignominious example of blasphemy against a *guru* and Vaiṣṇava. Such a story should never be accepted as authoritative.

According to another accusation, Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī did not approve of the principles of the *parakīya-rasa* of Vraja-dhāma and therefore supported *svakīya-rasa,* showing that Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa are eternally married. Actually, when Jīva Gosvāmī was alive, some of his followers disliked the *parakīya-rasa* of the *gopīs.* Therefore Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī, for their spiritual benefit, supported *svakīya-rasa,* for he could understand that *sahajiyās* would otherwise exploit the *parakīya-rasa,* as they are actually doing at the present time. Unfortunately, in Vṛndāvana and Navadvīpa it has become fashionable among *sahajiyās,* in their debauchery, to find an unmarried sexual partner to live with to execute so-called devotional service in *parakīya-rasa.* Foreseeing this, Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī supported *svakīya-rasa,* and later all the Vaiṣṇava *ācāryas* also approved of it. Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī was never opposed to the transcendental *parakīya-rasa,* nor has any other Vaiṣṇava disapproved of it. Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī strictly followed his predecessor *gurus* and Vaiṣṇavas, Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī and Sanātana Gosvāmī, and Śrīla Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī accepted him as one of his instructor *gurus.*

### Purport

Although it is not only in western India that people were contaminated by association with Muslims, it is a fact that the farther west one goes in India the more he will find the people to be fallen from the Vedic culture. Until five thousand years ago, when the entire planet was under the control of Mahārāja Parīkṣit, the Vedic culture was current everywhere. Gradually, however, people were influenced by non-Vedic culture, and they lost sight of how to behave in connection with devotional service. Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī and Sanātana Gosvāmī very kindly preached the *bhakti* cult in western India, and following in their footsteps the propagators of the Caitanya cult in the Western countries are spreading the *saṅkīrtana* movement and inculcating the principles of Vaiṣṇava behavior, thus purifying and reforming many persons who were previously accustomed to the culture of *mlecchas* and *yavanas.* All of our devotees in the Western countries give up their old habits of illicit sex, intoxication, meat-eating and gambling. Of course, five hundred years ago these practices were unknown in India — at least in eastern India — but unfortunately at present all of India has been victimized by these non-Vedic principles, which are sometimes even supported by the government.

### Purport

The spot where we now find Śrī Rādhā-kuṇḍa was an agricultural field during the time of Caitanya Mahāprabhu. A small reservoir of water was there, and Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu bathed in that water and pointed out that originally Rādhā-kuṇḍa existed in that location. Following His directions, Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī and Sanātana Gosvāmī renovated Rādhā-kuṇḍa. This is one of the brilliant examples of how the Gosvāmīs excavated lost places of pilgrimage. Similarly, it is through the endeavor of the Gosvāmīs that all the important temples in Vṛndāvana were established. Originally there were seven important Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava temples established in Vṛndāvana, namely the Madana-mohana temple, Govinda temple, Gopīnātha temple, Śrī Rādhāramaṇa temple, Rādhā-Śyāmasundara temple, Rādhā-Dāmodara temple and Gokulānanda temple.

### Purport

Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura writes in his *Anubhāṣya,* “Śrīla Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī was most probably born in the year 1416 Śakābda (A.D. 1494) in a *kāyastha* family as the son of Govardhana Majumadāra, who was the younger brother of the then zamindar, Hiraṇya Majumadāra. The village where he took birth is known as Śrī-kṛṣṇapura. On the railway line between Calcutta and Burdwan is a station named Triśābaghā \[now known as Ādi-saptagrāma\], and about one and a half miles away is the village of Śrī-kṛṣṇapura, where the parental home of Śrī Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī was situated. A temple of Śrī Śrī Rādhā-Govinda is still there. In front of the temple is a large open area but no large hall for devotees to assemble. A rich Calcutta gentleman named Haricaraṇa Ghoṣa, who resided in the Simlā quarter, recently repaired the temple. The entire temple compound is surrounded by walls, and in a small room just to the side of the temple is a small platform on which Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī used to worship the Deity. By the side of the temple is the dying river Sarasvatī.”

The forefathers of Śrīla Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī were all Vaiṣṇavas and were very rich men. His spiritual master at home was Yadunandana Ācārya. Although Raghunātha dāsa was a family man, he had no attachment for his estate and wife. Seeing his tendency to leave home, his father and uncle engaged special bodyguards to watch over him, but nevertheless he managed to escape their vigilance and went away to Jagannātha Purī to meet Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. This incident took place in the year 1439 Śakābda (A.D. 1517). Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī compiled three books, named *Stava-mālā* (or *Stavāvalī*), *Dāna-carita* and *Muktā-carita.* He lived a long time, residing for most of his life at Rādhā-kuṇḍa. The place where Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī performed his devotional service still exists by Rādhā-kuṇḍa. He almost completely gave up eating, and therefore he was very skinny and of weak health. His only concern was to chant the holy name of the Lord. He gradually reduced his sleeping until he was almost not sleeping at all. It is said that his eyes were always full of tears. When Śrīnivāsa Ācārya went to see Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī, the Gosvāmī blessed him by embracing him. Śrīnivāsa Ācārya requested his blessings for preaching in Bengal, and Śrīla Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī granted them. In the *Gaura-gaṇoddeśa-dīpikā* (186) it is stated that Śrīla Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī was formerly the *gopī* named Rasa-mañjarī. Sometimes it is said that he was Rati-mañjarī.

### Purport

This confidential service was the personal care of the Lord. Svarūpa Dāmodara, acting as His secretary, attended to the Lord’s baths, meals, rest and massages, and Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī assisted him. In effect, Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī acted as the assistant secretary of the Lord.

**Śrī Gopāla Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmī, the forty-seventh branch, was one of the great and exalted branches of the tree. He always engaged in discourses about love of Godhead in the company of Rūpa Gosvāmī and Sanātana Gosvāmī.**

### Purport

Śrī Gopāla Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmī was the son of Veṅkaṭa Bhaṭṭa, a resident of Śrī Raṅgam. Gopāla Bhaṭṭa formerly belonged to the disciplic succession of the Rāmānuja-sampradāya but later became part of the Gauḍīya-sampradāya. In the year 1433 Śakābda (A.D. 1511), when Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu was touring South India, He stayed for four months during the period of Cāturmāsya at the house of Veṅkaṭa Bhaṭṭa, who then got the opportunity to serve the Lord to his heart’s content. Gopāla Bhaṭṭa also got the opportunity to serve the Lord at this time. Śrī Gopāla Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmī was later initiated by his uncle, the great *sannyāsī* Prabodhānanda Sarasvatī. Both the father and the mother of Gopāla Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmī were extremely fortunate, for they dedicated their entire lives to the service of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. They allowed Gopāla Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmī to go to Vṛndāvana, and they gave up their lives thinking of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. When Lord Caitanya was later informed that Gopāla Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmī had gone to Vṛndāvana and met Śrī Rūpa and Sanātana Gosvāmī, He was very pleased, and He advised Śrī Rūpa and Sanātana to accept Gopāla Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmī as their younger brother and take care of him. Śrī Sanātana Gosvāmī, out of his great affection for Gopāla Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmī, compiled the Vaiṣṇava *smṛti* named *Hari-bhakti-vilāsa* and published it under his name. Under the instruction of Śrīla Rūpa and Sanātana, Gopāla Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmī installed one of the seven principal Deities of Vṛndāvana, the Rādhāramaṇa Deity. The *sevaits* (priests) of the Rādhāramaṇa temple belong to the Gauḍīya-sampradāya.

When Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī took permission from all the Vaiṣṇavas before writing *Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta,* Gopāla Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmī also gave him his blessings, but he requested him not to mention his name in the book. Therefore Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī has mentioned Gopāla Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmī only very cautiously in one or two passages of the *Caitanya-caritāmṛta.* Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī has written in the beginning of his *Tattva-sandarbha,* “A devotee from southern India who was born of a *brāhmaṇa* family and was a very intimate friend of Rūpa Gosvāmī and Sanātana Gosvāmī has written a book that he has not compiled chronologically. Therefore I, a tiny living entity known as *jīva,* am trying to assort the events of the book chronologically, consulting the direction of great personalities like Madhvācārya, Śrīdhara Svāmī, Rāmānujācārya and other senior Vaiṣṇavas in the disciplic succession.” In the beginning of the *Bhagavat-sandarbha* there are similar statements by Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī. Śrīla Gopāla Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmī compiled a book called *Sat-kriyāsāra-dīpikā,* edited the *Hari-bhakti-vilāsa,* wrote a foreword to the *Ṣaṭ-sandarbha* and a commentary on the *Kṛṣṇa-karṇāmṛta,* and installed the Rādhāramaṇa Deity in Vṛndāvana. In the *Gaura-gaṇoddeśa-dīpikā* (184) it is mentioned that his previous name in the pastimes of Lord Kṛṣṇa was Anaṅga-mañjarī. Sometimes he is also said to have been an incarnation of Guṇa-mañjarī. Śrīnivāsa Ācārya and Gopīnātha Pūjārī were two of his disciples.

### Translation

**The ācārya Śaṅkarāraṇya was considered the forty-eighth branch of the original tree. From Him proceeded the subbranches known as Mukunda, Kāśīnātha and Rudra.**

### Purport

It is said that Śaṅkarāraṇya was the *sannyāsa* name of Śrīla Viśvarūpa, who was the elder brother of Viśvambhara (the original name of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu). Śaṅkarāraṇya expired in 1432 Śakābda (A.D. 1510) at Sholapur, where there is a place of pilgrimage known as Pāṇḍarapura. This is referred to in the *Madhya-līlā,* chapter nine, verses 299 and 300.

Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura writes in his *Anubhāṣya,* “Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu opened a primary school in the house of Mukunda, or Mukunda Sañjaya, and Mukunda’s son, whose name was Puruṣottama, became the Lord’s student. Kāśīnātha arranged the marriage of Lord Caitanya in His previous *āśrama,* when His name was Viśvambhara. Kāśīnātha induced the court *paṇḍita,* Sanātana, to offer Viśvambhara his daughter. In text 50 of the *Gaura-gaṇoddeśa-dīpikā* it is mentioned that Kāśīnātha was an incarnation of the *brāhmaṇa* Kulaka, whom Satrājit sent to arrange the marriage of Kṛṣṇa and Satyabhāmā, and in text 135 it is mentioned that Rudra, or Śrī Rudrarāma Paṇḍita, was formerly a friend of Lord Kṛṣṇa’s named Varūthapa. Śrī Rudrarāma Paṇḍita constructed a big temple at Vallabhapura, which is one mile north of Māheśa, for the Deities named Rādhāvallabha. The descendants of his brother, Yadunandana Vandyopādhyāya, are known as Cakravartī Ṭhākuras, and they are in charge of the maintenance of this temple as *sevaits.* Formerly the Jagannātha Deity used to come to the temple of Rādhāvallabha from Māheśa during the Ratha-yātrā festival, but in the Bengali year 1262 \[A.D. 1855\], due to a misunderstanding between the priests of the two temples, the Jagannātha Deity stopped coming.”

### Purport

Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura writes in his *Anubhāṣya,* “About one and a half miles away from Kumārahaṭṭa, or Kāmarhaṭṭa, which is a few miles from Calcutta, is a village known as Kāṅcaḍāpāḍā, which was the home of Śrī Śivānanda Sena. There he constructed a temple of Śrī Gauragopāla. Śrīnātha Paṇḍita established another temple there with Śrī Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa *mūrtis.* The Deity of that temple is named Śrī Kṛṣṇa Rāya. The temple of Kṛṣṇa Rāya, which was constructed in the year 1708 Śakābda \[A.D. 1786\] by a prominent zamindar named Nimāi Mullik of Pāthuriyā-ghāṭa in Calcutta, is very large. There is a big courtyard in front of the temple, and there are residential quarters for visitors and good arrangements for cooking *prasādam.* The entire courtyard is surrounded by very high boundary walls, and the temple is almost as big as the Māheśa temple. Inscribed on a tablet are the names of Śrīnātha Paṇḍita and his father and grandfather and the date of construction of the temple. Śrīnātha Paṇḍita, one of the disciples of Advaita Prabhu, was the spiritual master of the third son of Śivānanda Sena, who was known as Paramānanda Kavi-karṇapūra. It is said that the Kṛṣṇa Rāya Deity was installed during the time of Kavi-karṇapūra. According to hearsay, Vīrabhadra Prabhu, the son of Nityānanda Prabhu, brought a big stone from Murshidabad from which three Deities were carved — namely, the Rādhāvallabha *vigraha* of Vallabhapura, the Śyāmasundara *vigraha* of Khaḍadaha and the Śrī Kṛṣṇa Rāya *vigraha* of Kāṅcaḍāpāḍā. The home of Śivānanda Sena was situated on the bank of the Ganges near an almost ruined temple. It is said that the same Nimāi Mullik of Calcutta saw this broken-down temple of Kṛṣṇa Rāya while he was going to Benares and thereafter constructed the present temple.”

Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura writes in his *Anubhāṣya,* “In the *Gaura-gaṇoddeśa-dīpikā* (203) it is said, ‘Bhāgavata Ācārya compiled a book entitled *Kṛṣṇa-prema-taraṅgiṇī,* and he was the most beloved devotee of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu.’ When Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu visited Varāhanagara, now a suburb of Calcutta, He stayed in the house of a most fortunate *brāhmaṇa* who was a very learned scholar in *Bhāgavata* literature. As soon as this *brāhmaṇa* saw Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, he began to read *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.* When Mahāprabhu heard his explanation, which expounded *bhakti-yoga,* He immediately became unconscious in ecstasy. Lord Caitanya later said, ‘I have never heard such a nice explanation of *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.* I therefore designate you Bhāgavata Ācārya. Your only duty is to recite *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.* That is My injunction.’ His real name was Raghunātha. His monastery, which is situated in Varāhanagara, about three and a half miles north of Calcutta on the bank of the Ganges, still exists, and it is managed by the initiated disciples of the late Śrī Rāmadāsa Bābājī. Presently, however, it is not as well managed as in the presence of Bābājī Mahārāja.

“Another name of Ṭhākura Sāraṅga dāsa was Śārṅga Ṭhākura. Sometimes he was also called Śārṅgapāṇi or Śārṅgadhara. He was a resident of Navadvīpa in the neighborhood known as Modadruma-dvīpa, and he used to worship the Supreme Lord in a secluded place on the bank of the Ganges. He was not accepting disciples, but he was repeatedly being inspired from within by the Supreme Personality of Godhead to do so. Thus one morning he decided, ‘Whomever I see I shall make my disciple.’ When he went to the bank of the Ganges to take his bath, by chance he saw a dead body floating in the water, and he touched it with his feet. This immediately brought the body to life, and Ṭhākura Sāraṅga dāsa accepted him as his disciple. This disciple later became famous as Ṭhākura Murāri, and his name is always associated with that of Śrī Sāraṅga. His disciplic succession still inhabits the village of Śar. There is a temple at Māmagāchi that is said to have been started by Sāraṅga Ṭhākura. Not long ago, a new temple building was erected in front of a *bakula* tree there, and it is now being managed by the members of the Gauḍīya Maṭha. It is said that the management of the temple is now far better than before. In the *Gaura-gaṇoddeśa-dīpikā* (172) it is stated that Sāraṅga Ṭhākura was formerly a *gopī* named Nāndīmukhī. Some devotees say that he was formerly Prahlāda Mahārāja, but Śrī Kavi-karṇapūra says that his father, Śivānanda Sena, does not accept this proposition.”

Vāṇīnātha Vipra was a resident of Cāṅpāhāṭi, a village in the district of Burdwan near the town of Navadvīpa, the police station of Pūrvasthalī and the post office of Samudragarh. The temple there was very much neglected, but it was renovated in the Bengali year 1328 \[A.D. 1921\] by Śrī Paramānanda Brahmacārī \[one of Śrī Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura’s disciples\], who reorganized the *sevā-pūjā* (worship in the temple) and placed the temple under the management of the Śrī Caitanya Maṭha of Śrī Māyāpur. In the temple as it now exists, the Deity of Śrī Gaura-Gadādhara is worshiped strictly according to the principles of the revealed scriptures. Cāṅpāhāṭi is two miles away from both Samudragarh and the Navadvīpa station of the Eastern Railway.”

### Purport

In the *Gaura-gaṇoddeśa-dīpikā* (115) it is said that the two brothers Jagāi and Mādhāi were formerly the doorkeepers named Jaya and Vijaya, who later became Hiraṇyākṣa and Hiraṇyakaśipu. Jagāi and Mādhāi were born in respectable *brāhmaṇa* families, but they adopted the professions of thieves and rogues and thus became implicated in all kinds of undesirable activities, especially woman-hunting, intoxication and gambling. Later, by the grace of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu and Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu, they were initiated, and they got the chance to chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra.* As a result of chanting, both brothers became exalted devotees of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. The descendants of Mādhāi still exist, and they are respectable *brāhmaṇas.* The tombs of these two brothers, Jagāi and Mādhāi, are in a place known as Ghoṣahāṭa, or Mādhāitalā-grāma, which is situated about one mile south of Katwa. It is said that Śrī Gopīcaraṇa dāsa Bābājī established a temple of Nitāi-Gaura at this place about two hundred fifty years ago.

### Translation

**There was Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya, one of the biggest branches of the tree of the Lord, and his sister’s husband, Śrī Gopīnātha Ācārya.**

### Purport

The original name of Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya was Vāsudeva Bhaṭṭācārya. His place of birth, which is known as Vidyānagara, is about two and a half miles away from the Navadvīpa railway station, or Cāṅpāhāṭi railway station. His father was a very much celebrated man of the name Maheśvara Viśārada. It is said that Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya was the greatest logician of his time in India. At Mithilā, in Bihar, he became a student of a great professor named Pakṣadhara Miśra, who did not allow any student to note down his explanations of logic. Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya was so talented, however, that he learned the explanations by heart, and when he later returned to Navadvīpa he established a school for the study of logic, thus diminishing the importance of Mithilā. Students from various parts of India still come to Navadvīpa to study logic. According to some authoritative opinions, the celebrated logician Raghunātha Śiromaṇi was also a student of Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya’s. In effect, Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya became the leader of all students of logic. Although he was a *gṛhastha* (householder), he even taught many *sannyāsīs* in the knowledge of logic.

He started a school at Jagannātha Purī for the study of Vedānta philosophy, of which he was a great scholar. When Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya met Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, he advised the Lord to learn Vedānta philosophy from him, but later he became a student of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu to understand the real meaning of Vedānta. Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya was so fortunate as to see the six-armed form of Lord Caitanya known as Ṣaḍbhuja. A Ṣaḍbhuja Deity is still situated at one end of the Jagannātha temple. Daily *saṅkīrtana* performances take place in this part of the temple. The meeting of Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya with Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu is vividly described in *Madhya-līlā,* chapter six. Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya wrote a book of one hundred verses named *Caitanya-śataka* or *Suśloka-śataka.* Two other verses he wrote, beginning with the words *vairāgya-vidyā-nija-bhakti-yoga* and *kālān naṣṭaṁ bhakti-yogaṁ nijaṁ yaḥ,* are very famous among Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇavas. The *Gaura-gaṇoddeśa-dīpikā* (119) states that Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya was an incarnation of Bṛhaspati, the learned scholar from the celestial planets.

Gopīnātha Ācārya, who belonged to a respectable *brāhmaṇa* family, was also an inhabitant of Navadvīpa and a constant companion of the Lord. He was the husband of Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya’s sister. In the *Gaura-gaṇoddeśa-dīpikā* (178) it is described that he was formerly the *gopī* named Ratnāvalī. According to the opinion of others, he was an incarnation of Brahmā.

### Purport

In Jagannātha Purī Lord Caitanya lived at the house of Kāśī Miśra, who was the priest of the King. Later this house was inherited by Vakreśvara Paṇḍita and then by his disciple Gopālaguru Gosvāmī, who established a Deity of Rādhākānta there. The *Gaura-gaṇoddeśa-dīpikā* (193) states that Kāśī Miśra was formerly Kubjā in Mathurā. Pradyumna Miśra, an inhabitant of Orissa, was a great devotee of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Pradyumna Miśra was born of a *brāhmaṇa* family and Rāmānanda Rāya of a non-*brāhmaṇa* family, yet Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu advised Pradyumna Miśra to take instruction from Rāmānanda Rāya. This incident is described in the *Antya-līlā,* chapter five.

Bhavānanda Rāya was the father of Śrī Rāmānanda Rāya. His residence was in Ālālanātha (Brahmagiri), which is about twelve miles west of Jagannātha Purī. By caste he belonged to the *karaṇa* community of Orissa, whose members were sometimes known as *kāyasthas* and sometimes as *śūdras;* his son Rāmānanda Rāya was the governor of Madras under the control of King Pratāparudra of Jagannātha Purī.

### Purport

The *Gaura-gaṇoddeśa-dīpikā* (120-24) states that Rāmānanda Rāya was formerly Arjuna. He is also considered to have been an incarnation of the *gopī* Lalitā, although in the opinion of others he was an incarnation of Viśākhādevī. He was a most confidential devotee of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, “Although I am a *sannyāsī,* My mind is sometimes perturbed when I see a woman. But Rāmānanda Rāya is greater than Me, for he is always undisturbed, even when he touches a woman.” Only Rāmānanda Rāya was endowed with the prerogative to touch a woman in this way; no one should imitate him. Unfortunately, there are rascals who imitate the activities of Rāmānanda Rāya. We need not discuss them further.

In Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s final pastimes, Rāmānanda Rāya and Svarūpa Dāmodara always engaged in reciting suitable verses from *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* and other books to pacify the Lord’s ecstatic feelings of separation from Kṛṣṇa. When Lord Caitanya went to southern India, Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya advised Him to meet Rāmānanda Rāya, declaring that there was no devotee as advanced in understanding the conjugal love of Kṛṣṇa and the *gopīs.* While touring South India, Lord Caitanya met Rāmānanda Rāya by the bank of the Godāvarī, and in their long discourses the Lord took the position of a student, and Rāmānanda Rāya instructed Him. Caitanya Mahāprabhu concluded these discourses by saying, “My dear Rāmānanda Rāya, both you and I are madmen, and therefore we met intimately on an equal level.” Lord Caitanya advised Rāmānanda Rāya to resign from his government post and come back to Jagannātha Purī to live with Him. Although Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu refused to see Mahārāja Pratāparudra because he was a king, Rāmānanda Rāya, by a Vaiṣṇava scheme, arranged a meeting between the Lord and the King. This is described in the *Madhya-līlā,* chapter twelve, verses 41-57. Śrī Rāmānanda Rāya was present during the water sports of the Lord after the Ratha-yātrā festival.

Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu considered Śrī Rāmānanda Rāya and Śrī Sanātana Gosvāmī to be equal in their renunciation, for although Śrī Rāmānanda Rāya was a *gṛhastha* engaged in government service and Śrī Sanātana Gosvāmī was in the renounced order of complete detachment from material activities, they were both servants of the Supreme Personality of Godhead who kept Kṛṣṇa in the center of all their activities. Śrī Rāmānanda Rāya was one of the three and a half personalities with whom Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu discussed the most confidential topics of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu advised Pradyumna Miśra to learn the science of Kṛṣṇa from Śrī Rāmānanda Rāya. As Subala always assisted Kṛṣṇa in His dealings with Rādhārāṇī in *kṛṣṇa-līlā,* so Rāmānanda Rāya assisted Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu in His feelings of separation from Kṛṣṇa. Śrī Rāmānanda Rāya was the author of the *Jagannātha-vallabha-nāṭaka.*

### Purport

Pratāparudra Mahārāja, who belonged to the dynasty of the Gaṅgā kings and whose capital was in Cuttack, was the Emperor of Orissa and a great devotee of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. It was by the arrangement of Rāmānanda Rāya and Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya that he was able to personally serve Lord Caitanya. In the *Gaura-gaṇoddeśa-dīpikā* (118) it is said that King Indradyumna, who established the temple of Jagannātha thousands of years ago, later took birth again in his own family as Mahārāja Pratāparudra during the time of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Mahārāja Pratāparudra was as powerful as King Indra. The drama named *Caitanya-candrodaya* was written under his direction.

In the *Caitanya-bhāgavata, Antya-khaṇḍa,* chapter five, Paramānanda Mahāpātra is described as follows: “Paramānanda Mahāpātra was among the devotees who took birth in Orissa and accepted Caitanya Mahāprabhu as their only asset. In the ecstasy of conjugal love, he always thought of Caitanya Mahāprabhu.” Bhagavān Ācārya, a very learned scholar, was formerly an inhabitant of Hālisahara, but he left everything to live with Caitanya Mahāprabhu in Jagannātha Purī. His relationship with Caitanya Mahāprabhu was friendly, like that of a cowherd boy. He was always friendly to Svarūpa Gosāñi, but he was staunchly devoted to the lotus feet of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. He sometimes invited Caitanya Mahāprabhu to his house.

Bhagavān Ācārya was very liberal and simple. His father, Śatānanda Khān, was completely materialistic, and his younger brother, Gopāla Bhaṭṭācārya, was a staunch Māyāvādī philosopher who had studied very elaborately. When his brother came to Jagannātha Purī, Bhagavān Ācārya wanted to hear from him about Māyāvāda philosophy, but Svarūpa Dāmodara forbade him to do so, and there the matter stopped. Once a friend of Bhagavān Ācārya’s from Bengal wanted to recite a drama that he had written that was against the principles of devotional service, and although Bhagavān Ācārya wanted to recite this drama before Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Svarūpa Dāmodara, the Lord’s secretary, did not allow him to do so. Later Svarūpa Dāmodara pointed out the drama’s many mistakes and its disagreements with the conclusion of devotional service, and the author became aware of the faults in his writing and then surrendered to Svarūpa Dāmodara, begging his mercy. This is described in the *Antya-līlā,* chapter five, verses 91-158.

In the *Gaura-gaṇoddeśa-dīpikā* (189) it is said that Śikhi Māhiti was formerly an assistant of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī named Rāgalekhā. His sister Mādhavī was also an assistant of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī and was named Kalākelī. Śikhi Māhiti, Mādhavī and their brother Murāri Māhiti were all unalloyed devotees of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu who could not forget Him for a moment of their lives. There is a book in the Oriyā language called *Caitanya-carita-mahākāvya,* in which there are many narrations about Śikhi Māhiti. One narration concerns his seeing an ecstatic dream. Śikhi Māhiti always engaged in serving the Lord in his mind. One night, while he was rendering such service, he fell asleep, and while he was asleep his brother and sister came to awaken him. At that time he was in full ecstasy because he was having a wonderful dream that Lord Caitanya, while visiting the temple of Jagannātha, was entering and again coming out of the body of Jagannātha and looking at the Jagannātha Deity. Thus as soon as he awakened he embraced his brother and sister and informed them, “My dear brother and sister, I have had a wonderful dream that I shall now explain to you. The activities of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, the son of Mother Śacī, are certainly most wonderful. I saw that Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, while visiting the temple of Jagannātha, was entering the body of Jagannātha and again coming out of His body. I am still seeing the same dream. Do you think I have become deranged? I am still seeing the same dream! And the most wonderful thing is that as soon as I came near Caitanya Mahāprabhu, He embraced me with His long arms.” As Śikhi Māhiti spoke to his brother and sister in this way, his voice faltered and there were tears in his eyes. Thus the brothers and sister went to the temple of Jagannātha, and there they saw Lord Caitanya in the Jagamohana *kīrtana* hall, looking at the beauty of the Śrī Jagannātha Deity just as in Śikhi Māhiti’s dream. The Lord was so magnanimous that He immediately embraced Śikhi Māhiti, exclaiming, “You are the elder brother of Murāri!” Being thus embraced, Śikhi Māhiti felt ecstatic transcendental bliss. Thus he and his brother and sister always engaged in rendering service to the Lord. Murāri Māhiti, the younger brother of Śikhi Māhiti, is described in the *Madhya-līlā,* chapter ten, verse 44.

Within this world, Caitanya Mahāprabhu had three and a half very confidential devotees. The three were Svarūpa Gosāñi, Śrī Rāmānanda Rāya and Śikhi Māhiti, and Śikhi Māhiti’s sister, Mādhavīdevī, being a woman, was considered the half. Thus it is known that Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu had three and a half confidential devotees.

### Purport

Raghunātha Bhaṭṭācārya, or Raghunātha Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmī, one of the six Gosvāmīs, was the son of Tapana Miśra. Born in approximately 1425 Śakābda (A.D. 1503), he was expert in reciting *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,* and in *Antya-līlā,* chapter thirteen, it is stated that he was also expert in cooking; whatever he cooked would be nectarean. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was greatly pleased to accept the food that he cooked, and Raghunātha Bhaṭṭa used to take the remnants of food left by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Raghunātha Bhaṭṭācārya lived for eight months in Jagannātha Purī, after which Lord Caitanya ordered him to go to Vṛndāvana to join Śrī Rūpa Gosvāmī. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu asked Raghunātha Bhaṭṭācārya not to marry but to remain a *brahmacārī,* and He also ordered him to read *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* constantly. Thus he went to Vṛndāvana, where he engaged in reciting *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* to Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī. He was so expert in reciting *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* that he would recite each and every verse in three melodious tunes. While Raghunātha Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmī was living with Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, the Lord blessed him by offering him betel nuts offered to the Jagannātha Deity and a garland of *tulasī* said to be as long as fourteen cubits. Under Raghunātha Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmī’s order, one of his disciples constructed the Govinda temple. Raghunātha Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmī supplied all the ornaments of the Govinda Deity. He never talked of nonsense or worldly matters but always engaged in hearing about Kṛṣṇa twenty-four hours a day. He never cared to hear blasphemy of a Vaiṣṇava. Even when there were points to be criticized, he used to say that since all the Vaiṣṇavas were engaged in the service of the Lord, he did not mind their faults. Later Raghunātha Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmī lived by Rādhā-kuṇḍa in a small cottage. In the *Gaura-gaṇoddeśa-dīpikā* (185) it is said that Raghunātha Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmī was formerly the *gopī* named Rāga-mañjarī.

### Translation

**From each branch of the tree have grown hundreds and thousands of subbranches of disciples and granddisciples.**

### Purport

It was the desire of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu that His cult be spread all over the world. Therefore there is a great necessity for many, many disciples of the branches of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s disciplic succession. His cult should be spread not only in a few villages, or in Bengal, or in India, but all over the world. It is very regrettable that complacent so-called devotees criticize the members of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness for accepting *sannyāsa* and spreading the cult of Lord Caitanya all over the world. It is not our business to criticize anyone, but because they try to find fault with this movement, the real truth must be stated. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu wanted devotees all over the world, and Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura and Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura confirmed this. It is in pursuit of their will that the ISKCON movement is spreading all over the world. Genuine devotees of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu must take pride in the spread of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement instead of viciously criticizing its propaganda work.
