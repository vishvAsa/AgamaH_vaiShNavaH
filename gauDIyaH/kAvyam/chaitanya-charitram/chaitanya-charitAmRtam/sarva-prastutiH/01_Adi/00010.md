CHAPTER NINE

A summary of chapter nine has been given as follows by Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura in his *Amṛta-pravāha-bhāṣya.* In this chapter the author of *Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta* has devised a figurative example by describing “the desire tree of *bhakti*.” He considers Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, who is known as Viśvambhara, to be the gardener of this tree because He is the main personality who has taken charge of it. As the supreme enjoyer, He enjoyed the fruits Himself and distributed them as well. The seed of the tree was first sown in Navadvīpa, the birth site of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and then the tree was brought to Puruṣottama-kṣetra (Jagannātha Purī), and then to Vṛndāvana. The seed fructified first in Śrīla Mādhavendra Purī, and then in his disciple Śrī Īśvara Purī. It is figuratively described that both the tree itself and the trunk of the tree are Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Paramānanda Purī and eight other great *sannyāsīs* are like the spreading roots of the tree. From the main trunk there extend two special branches, Advaita Prabhu and Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu, and from those branches grow other branches and twigs. The tree surrounds the entire world, and the fruits of the tree are to be distributed to everyone. In this way the tree of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu intoxicates the entire world. It should be noted that this is a figurative example meant to explain the mission of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

तं श्रीमत्कृष्णचैतन्यदेवं वन्दे जगद्‌गुरुम् ।  
यस्यानुकम्पय़ा श्वापि महाव्धिं सन्तरेत् सुखम् ॥ १ ॥

### Verse text

devaṁ vande jagad-gurum  
yasyānukampayā śvāpi  
mahābdhiṁ santaret sukham*

### Synonyms

*tam* — unto Him; *śrīmat* — with all opulence; *kṛṣṇa*-*caitanya*-*devam* — unto Lord Kṛṣṇa Caitanyadeva; *vande* — I offer obeisances; *jagat*-*gurum* — spiritual master of the world; *yasya* — whose; *anukampayā* — by the mercy of; *śvā* *api* — even a dog; *mahā*-*abdhim* — great ocean; *santaret* — can swim; *sukham* — without difficulty.

### Translation

### Purport

Sometimes it is to be seen that a dog can swim in the water for a few yards and then come back to the shore. Here, however, it is stated that if a dog is blessed by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, he can swim across an ocean. Similarly, the author of *Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta,* Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī, placing himself in a helpless condition, states that he has no personal power, but by the desire of Lord Caitanya, expressed through the Vaiṣṇavas and the Madana-mohana *vigraha,* it is possible for him to cross a transcendental ocean to present *Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta*.

śrī-jīva, gopāla-bhaṭṭa, dāsa-raghunātha*

### Synonyms

*śrī*-*rūpa* — Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī; *sanātana* — Śrīla Sanātana Gosvāmī; *bhaṭṭa* *raghunātha* — Raghunātha Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmī; *śrī*-*jīva* — Śrī Jīva Gosvāmī; *gopāla*-*bhaṭṭa* — Śrī Gopāla Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmī; *dāsa*-*raghunātha* — Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī.

### Translation

**I also remember the six Gosvāmīs — Rūpa, Sanātana, Bhaṭṭa Raghunātha, Śrī Jīva, Gopāla Bhaṭṭa and Dāsa Raghunātha.**

### Purport

This is the process for writing transcendental literature. A sentimentalist who has no Vaiṣṇava qualifications cannot produce transcendental writings. There are many fools who consider *kṛṣṇa-līlā* to be a subject of art and who write or paint pictures about the pastimes of Lord Kṛṣṇa with the *gopīs,* sometimes depicting them in a manner practically obscene. These fools take pleasure in material sense gratification, but one who wants to make advancement in spiritual life must scrupulously avoid their literature. Unless one is a servant of Kṛṣṇa and the Vaiṣṇavas, as Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī presents himself to be in offering respects to Lord Caitanya, His associates and His disciples, one should not attempt to write transcendental literature.

### Verse text

*e-saba-prasāde likhi caitanya-līlā-guṇa  
jāni vā nā jāni, kari āpana-śodhana*

### Synonyms

*e*-*saba* — all these; *prasāde* — by the mercy of; *likhi* — I write; *caitanya* — of Lord Caitanya; *līlā*-*guṇa* — pastimes and qualities; *jāni* — know; *vā* — or; *nā* — not; *jāni* — know; *kari* — do; *āpana* — self; *śodhana* — purification.

### Translation

**It is by the mercy of all these Vaiṣṇavas and gurus that I attempt to write about the pastimes and qualities of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Whether I know it or know not, it is for self-purification that I write this book.**

### Purport

This is the sum and substance of transcendental writing. One must be an authorized Vaiṣṇava, humble and pure. One should write transcendental literature to purify oneself, not for credit. By writing about the pastimes of the Lord, one associates with the Lord directly. One should not ambitiously think, “I shall become a great author. I shall be celebrated as a writer.” These are material desires. One should attempt to write for self-purification. It may be published or it may not be published, but that does not matter. If one is actually sincere in writing, all his ambitions will be fulfilled. Whether one is known as a great author is incidental. One should not attempt to write transcendental literature for material name and fame.

### Purport

In many places devotional service has been compared to a creeper. One has to sow the seed of the devotional creeper, *bhakti-latā,* within his heart. As he regularly hears and chants, the seed will fructify and gradually grow into a mature plant and then produce the fruit of devotional service, namely love of Godhead, which the gardener (*mālā-kāra*) can then enjoy without impediments.

### Purport

Śrī Mādhavendra Purī, also known as Śrī Mādhava Purī, belonged to the disciplic succession from Madhvācārya and was a greatly celebrated *sannyāsī.* Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was the third disciplic descendant from Śrī Mādhavendra Purī. The process of worship in the disciplic succession of Madhvācārya was full of ritualistic ceremonies, with hardly a sign of love of Godhead. Śrī Mādhavendra Purī was the first person in that disciplic succession to exhibit the symptoms of love of Godhead and the first to write a poem beginning with the words *ayi dīna-dayārdra nātha,* “O supremely merciful Personality of Godhead.” In that poem is the seed of Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s cultivation of love of Godhead.

### Translation

**The seed of devotional service next fructified in the form of Śrī Īśvara Purī, and then the gardener Himself, Caitanya Mahāprabhu, became the main trunk of the tree of devotional service.**

### Purport

Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura writes in his *Anubhāṣya,* “Śrī Īśvara Purī was a resident of Kumārahaṭṭa, where there is now a railroad station known as Kāmarhaṭṭa. Nearby there is another station, named Hālisahara, which belongs to the Eastern Railway. This railway runs from the eastern section of Calcutta.”

Īśvara Purī appeared in a *brāhmaṇa* family and was the most beloved disciple of Śrīla Mādhavendra Purī. In the last portion of *Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta* (*Antya* 8.28-31), it is stated:

*īśvara-purī gosāñi kare śrī-pada sevana  
sva-haste karena mala-mūtrādi mārjana*

*nirantara kṛṣṇa-nāma karāya smaraṇa  
kṛṣṇa-nāma kṛṣṇa-līlā śunāya anukṣaṇa*

*tuṣṭa hañā purī tāṅre kaila āliṅgana  
vara dilā kṛṣṇe tomāra ha-uka prema-dhana*

*sei haite īśvara-purī premera sāgara*

“At the last stage of his life Śrī Mādhavendra Purī became an invalid and was completely unable to move, and Īśvara Purī so completely engaged himself in his service that he personally cleaned up his stool and urine. Always chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra* and reminding Śrī Mādhavendra Purī about the pastimes of Lord Kṛṣṇa in the last stage of his life, Īśvara Purī gave the best service among his disciples. Thus Mādhavendra Purī, being very pleased with him, blessed him, saying, ‘My dear boy, I can only pray to Kṛṣṇa that He will be pleased with you.’ Thus Īśvara Purī, by the grace of his spiritual master, Śrī Mādhavendra Purī, became a great devotee in the ocean of love of Godhead.” Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī states in his *Gurv-aṣṭaka* prayer, *yasya prasādād bhagavat-prasādo yasyāprasādān na gatiḥ kuto ’pi:* “By the mercy of the spiritual master one is blessed by the mercy of Kṛṣṇa. Without the grace of the spiritual master one cannot make any advancement.” It is by the mercy of the spiritual master that one becomes perfect, as vividly exemplified here. A Vaiṣṇava is always protected by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but if he appears to be an invalid, this gives a chance to his disciples to serve him. Īśvara Purī pleased his spiritual master by service, and by the blessings of his spiritual master he became such a great personality that Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu accepted him as His spiritual master.

Śrīla Īśvara Purī was the spiritual master of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, but before initiating Lord Caitanya he went to Navadvīpa and lived for a few months in the house of Gopīnātha Ācārya. At that time Lord Caitanya became acquainted with him, and it is understood that he served Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu by reciting his book, *Kṛṣṇa-līlāmṛta.* This is explained in *Śrī Caitanya-bhāgavata, Ādi-khaṇḍa,* chapter eleven.

To teach others by example how to be a faithful disciple of one’s spiritual master, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, visited the birthplace of Īśvara Purī at Kumāra-haṭṭa and collected some earth from his birth site. This He kept very carefully, and He used to eat a small portion of it daily. This is stated in the *Caitanya-bhāgavata, Ādi-khaṇḍa,* chapter seventeen. It has now become customary for devotees, following the example of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, to go there and collect some earth from that place.

Thus the tree stood steadfastly on the strength of these nine roots.**

### Purport

*Paramānanda Purī:* Paramānanda Purī belonged to a *brāhmaṇa* family of the Trihut district in Uttara Pradesh. Mādhavendra Purī was his spiritual master. In relationship with Mādhavendra Purī, Paramānanda Purī was very dear to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. In the *Caitanya-bhāgavata, Antya-khaṇḍa,* there is the following statement:

*sannyāsīra madhye īśvarera priya-pātra  
āra nāhi eka purī gosāñi se mātra*

*dāmodara-svarūpa paramānanda-purī  
sannyāsi-pārṣade ei dui adhikārī*

*niravadhi nikaṭe thākena dui jana  
prabhura sannyāse kare daṇḍera grahaṇa*

*purī dhyāna-para dāmodarera kīrtana  
yata-prīti īśvarera purī-gosāñire*

*dāmodara-svarūpereo tata prīti kare*

“Among his *sannyāsī* disciples, Īśvara Purī and Paramānanda Purī were very dear to Mādhavendra Purī. Thus Paramānanda Purī, like Svarūpa Dāmodara, who was also a *sannyāsī,* was very dear to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and was His constant associate. When Lord Caitanya accepted the renounced order, Paramānanda Purī offered Him the *daṇḍa.* Paramānanda Purī was always engaged in meditation, and Śrī Svarūpa was always engaged in chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra.* As Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu offered full respect to His spiritual master, Īśvara Purī, He similarly respected Paramānanda Purī and Svarūpa Dāmodara.” It is described in the *Caitanya-bhāgavata, Antya-khaṇḍa,* chapter three, that when Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu first saw Paramānanda Purī He made the following statement:

*āji dhanya locana, saphala āji janma  
saphala āmāra āji haila sarva-dharma*

*prabhu bale āji mora saphala sannyāsa  
āji mādhavendra more ha-ilā prakāśa*

“My eyes, My mind, My religious activities and My acceptance of the *sannyāsa* order have now all become perfect because today Mādhavendra Purī is manifest before Me in the form of Paramānanda Purī.” The *Caitanya-bhāgavata* further states:

*kathokṣaṇe anyo ’nye karena praṇāma  
paramānanda-purī caitanyera priya-dhāma*

“Thus Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu exchanged respectful obeisances with Paramānanda Purī, who was very dear to Him.” Paramānanda Purī established a small monastery behind the western side of the Jagannātha temple, where he had a well dug to supply water. The water, however, was bitter, and therefore Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu prayed to Lord Jagannātha to allow Ganges water to come into the well to make it sweet. When Lord Jagannātha granted the request, Lord Caitanya told all the devotees that from that day hence, the water of Paramānanda Purī’s well should be celebrated as Ganges water, for any devotee who would drink it or bathe in it would certainly get the same benefit as that derived from drinking or bathing in the waters of the Ganges. Such a person would certainly develop pure love of Godhead. It is stated in the *Caitanya-bhāgavata* (*Antya* 3.255):

*prabhu bale āmi ye āchiye pṛthivīte  
niścaya-i jāniha purī-gosāñira prīte*

“Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu used to say, ‘I am living in this world only on account of the excellent behavior of Śrī Paramānanda Purī.’ ” The *Gaura-gaṇoddeśa-dīpikā* (118) states, *purī śrī-paramānando ya āsīd uddhavaḥ purā.* “Paramānanda Purī is none other than Uddhava.” Uddhava was Lord Kṛṣṇa’s friend and cousin, and in *caitanya-līlā* the same Uddhava became the friend of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and His uncle in terms of their relationship in the disciplic succession.

*Keśava Bhāratī:* The Sarasvatī, Bhāratī and Purī *sampradāyas* belong to the Śṛṅgerī-maṭha in South India, and Śrī Keśava Bhāratī, who at that time was situated in a monastery in Katwa, belonged to the Bhāratī-sampradāya. According to some authoritative opinions, although Keśava Bhāratī belonged to the Śaṅkara-sampradāya, he had formerly been initiated by a Vaiṣṇava. He is said to have been a Vaiṣṇava on account of having been initiated by Mādhavendra Purī, for some say that he took *sannyāsa* from Mādhavendra Purī. The temple and Deity worship started by Keśava Bhāratī are still existing in the village known as Khāṭundi, which is under the postal jurisdiction of Kāndarā in the district of Burdwan. According to the managers of that *maṭha,* the priests are descendants of Keśava Bhāratī, and some say that the worshipers of the Deity are descendants of the sons of Keśava Bhāratī. In his householder life he had two sons, Niśāpati and Ūṣāpati, and a *brāhmaṇa* of the name Śrī Nakaḍicandra Vidyāratna, who was a member of the family of Niśāpati, was the priest in charge at the time that Śrī Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī visited this temple. According to some, the priests of the temple belong to the family of Keśava Bhāratī’s brother. Still another opinion is that they descend from Mādhava Bhāratī, who was another disciple of Keśava Bhāratī’s. Mādhava Bhāratī’s disciple Balabhadra, who also later became a *sannyāsī* of the Bhāratī-sampradāya, had two sons in his family life, named Madana and Gopāla. Madana, whose family’s surname was Bhāratī, lived in the village of Āuriyā, and Gopāla, whose family’s surname was Brahmacārī, lived in the village of Denduḍa. There are still many living descendants of both families.

In the *Gaura-gaṇoddeśa-dīpikā* (52), it is said:

*mathurāyāṁ yajña-sūtraṁ* *purā kṛṣṇāya yo muniḥ  
dadau sāndīpaniḥ so ’bhūd* *adya keśava-bhāratī*

“Sāndīpani Muni, who formerly offered the sacred thread to Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma, later became Keśava Bhāratī.” It is he who offered *sannyāsa* to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. There is another statement about Keśava Bhāratī from the *Gaura-gaṇoddeśa-dīpikā* (117): *iti kecit prabhāṣante ’krūraḥ keśava-bhāratī.* “According to some authoritative opinions, Keśava Bhāratī is an incarnation of Akrūra.” Keśava Bhāratī offered the *sannyāsa* order to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu in the year 1432 *śakābda* (A.D. 1510) in Katwa. This is stated in the *Vaiṣṇava-mañjuṣā,* Part Two.

*Brahmānanda Purī:* Śrī Brahmānanda Purī was one of the associates of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu while He was performing *kīrtana* in Navadvīpa, and he also joined Lord Caitanya in Jagannātha Purī. We may note in this connection that the name Brahmānanda is accepted not only by Māyāvādī *sannyāsīs* but by Vaiṣṇava *sannyāsīs* also. One of our foolish Godbrothers criticized our *sannyāsī* Brahmānanda Svāmī, saying that this was a Māyāvādī name. The foolish man did not know that Brahmānanda does not always refer to the impersonal Brahman. Parabrahman, the Supreme Brahman, is Kṛṣṇa. A devotee of Kṛṣṇa can therefore also be called Brahmānanda; this is evident from the fact that Brahmānanda Purī was one of the chief *sannyāsī* associates of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

*Brahmānanda Bhāratī:* Brahmānanda Bhāratī went to see Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya Mahāprabhu at Jagannātha-dhāma. At that time he used to wear only a deerskin to cover himself, and Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu indirectly indicated that He did not like this deerskin covering. Brahmānanda Bhāratī therefore gave it up and accepted a loincloth of saffron color, as used by Vaiṣṇava *sannyāsīs.* For some time he lived with Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu at Jagannātha Purī.

### Purport

This tree of devotional service is not of this material world. It grows in the spiritual world, where there is no distinction between one part of the body and another. It is something like a tree of sugar, for whichever part of such a tree one tastes, it is always sweet. The tree of *bhakti* has varieties of branches, leaves and fruits, but they are all meant for the service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. There are nine different processes of devotional service (*śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ smaraṇaṁ pāda-sevanam arcanaṁ vandanaṁ dāsyaṁ sakhyam ātma-nivedanam*), but all of them are meant only for the service of the Supreme Lord. Therefore whether one hears, chants, remembers or worships, his activities will yield the same result. Which one of these processes will be the most suitable for a particular devotee depends upon his taste.

There is no distinction made between those who are fit and those who are not fit to hear or take part in the *saṅkīrtana* movement. It should therefore be preached without discrimination. The only purpose of the preachers of the *saṅkīrtana* movement must be to go on preaching without restriction. That is the way in which Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu introduced this *saṅkīrtana* movement to the world.

### Translation

**“Since the tree of devotional service is transcendental, every one of its parts can perform the action of all the others. Although a tree is supposed to be immovable, this tree nevertheless moves.**

### Purport

It is our experience in the material world that trees stand in one place, but in the spiritual world a tree can go from one place to another. Therefore everything in the spiritual world is called *alaukika,* uncommon or transcendental. Another feature of such a tree is that it can act universally. In the material world the roots of a tree go deep within the earth to gather food, but in the spiritual world the twigs, branches and leaves of the upper portion of the tree can act like the roots.

Here Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu indicates that the distribution of the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra* should be performed by combined forces. Although He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, He laments, “How can I act alone? How can I alone pick the fruit and distribute it all over the world?” This indicates that all classes of devotees should combine to distribute the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra* without consideration of the time, place or situation.

### Translation

**“Therefore I order every man within this universe to accept this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement and distribute it everywhere.**

### Purport

In this connection there is a song sung by Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura:

*enechi auṣadhi māyā nāśibāra lāgi’  
harināma-mahāmantra lao tumi māgi’*

*bhakativinoda prabhu-caraṇe paḍiyā  
sei harināma-mantra la-ila māgiyā*

The *saṅkīrtana* movement has been introduced by Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu just to dispel the illusion of *māyā,* by which everyone in this material world thinks himself to be a product of matter and therefore to have many duties pertaining to the body. Actually, the living entity is not his material body: he is a spirit soul. He has a spiritual need to be eternally blissful and full of knowledge, but unfortunately he identifies himself with the body, sometimes as a human being, sometimes as an animal, sometimes a tree, sometimes an aquatic, sometimes a demigod, and so on. Thus with each change of body he develops a different type of consciousness with different types of activities and thus becomes increasingly entangled in material existence, transmigrating perpetually from one body to another. Under the spell of *māyā,* or illusion, he does not consider the past or future but is simply satisfied with the short life span that he has gotten for the present. To eradicate this illusion, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu has brought the *saṅkīrtana* movement, and He requests everyone to accept and distribute it. A person who is actually a follower of Śrī Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura must immediately accept the request of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu by offering respectful obeisances unto His lotus feet and thus beg from Him the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra.* If one is fortunate enough to beg from the Lord this Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra,* his life is successful.

### Translation

**“I am the only gardener. If I do not distribute these fruits, what shall I do with them? How many fruits can I alone eat?**

### Purport

Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu produced so many fruits of devotional service that they must be distributed all over the world; otherwise, how could He alone relish and taste each and every fruit? The original reason that Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa descended as Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was to understand Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī’s love for Kṛṣṇa and to taste that love. The fruits of the tree of devotional service were innumerable, and therefore He wanted to distribute them unrestrictedly to everyone. Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī therefore writes:

*anarpita-carīṁ cirāt karuṇayāvatīrṇaḥ kalau *
 *samarpayitum unnatojjvala-rasāṁ sva-bhakti-śriyam  
hariḥ puraṭa-sundara-dyuti-kadamba-sandīpitaḥ *
 *sadā hṛdaya-kandare sphuratu vaḥ śacī-nandanaḥ*

There were many previous incarnations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but none were so generous, kind and magnanimous as Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, for He distributed the most confidential aspect of devotional service, namely, the conjugal love of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa. Therefore Śrī Rūpa Gosvāmī Prabhupāda desires that Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu live perpetually in the hearts of all devotees, for thus they can understand and relish the loving affairs of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī and Kṛṣṇa.

### Synonyms

*ātma* — self; *icchā*-*amṛte* — by the nectar of the will; *vṛkṣa* — the tree; *siñci* — sprinkle; *nirantara* — constantly; *tāhāte* — there; *asaṅkhya* — unlimited; *phala* — fruits; *vṛkṣera* — on the tree; *upara* — upper.

### Translation

**“By the transcendental desire of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, water has been sprinkled all over the tree, and thus there are innumerable fruits of love of Godhead.**

### Purport

God is unlimited, and His desires are also unlimited. This example of unlimited fruits is factually appropriate even within the material context, for with the good will of the Supreme Personality of Godhead there can be enough fruits, grain and other foodstuffs produced so that all the people in the world could not finish them, even if they ate ten times their capacity. In this material world there is actually no scarcity of anything but Kṛṣṇa consciousness. If people become Kṛṣṇa conscious, by the transcendental will of the Supreme Personality of Godhead there will be enough foodstuffs produced so that people will have no economic problems at all*.* One can very easily understand this fact. The production of fruits and flowers depends not upon our will but upon the supreme will of the Personality of Godhead. If He is pleased, He can supply enough fruits, flowers, etc., but if people are atheistic and godless, then nature, by His will, restricts the supply of food. For example, in several provinces in India, especially Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and other adjoining states, there is sometimes a great scarcity of foodstuffs due to lack of rainfall. So-called scientists and economists cannot do anything about this. Therefore, to solve all problems, one must seek the good will of the Supreme Personality of Godhead by becoming Kṛṣṇa conscious and worshiping Him regularly in devotional service.

*ataeva* — therefore; *saba* — all; *phala* — fruits; *deha’* — distribute; *yāre* *tāre* — to everyone and anyone; *khāiyā* — eating; *ha*-*uk* — let them become; *loka* — all people; *ajara* — without old age; *amare* — without death.

### Translation

**“Distribute this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement all over the world. Let people eat these fruits and ultimately become free from old age and death.**

### Purport

The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement introduced by Lord Caitanya is extremely important because one who takes to it becomes eternal, being freed from birth, death and old age. People do not recognize that the real distresses in life are the four principles of birth, death, old age and disease. They are so foolish that they resign themselves to these four miseries, not knowing the transcendental remedy of the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra.* Simply by chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra,* one can become free from all misery, but because they are enchanted by the illusory energy, people do not take this movement seriously. Therefore those who are actually servants of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu must seriously distribute this movement all over the world to render the greatest benefit to human society. Of course, animals and other lower species are not capable of understanding this movement, but if even a small number of human beings take it seriously, then by their chanting loudly, all living entities, including even trees, animals and other lower species, will be benefited. When Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu inquired from Haridāsa Ṭhākura how He was to benefit living entities other than humans, Śrīla Haridāsa Ṭhākura replied that the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra* is so potent that if it is chanted loudly, everyone will benefit, including the lower species of life.

They are finding peace in *saṅkīrtana,* and therefore they are acknowledging the supreme benefit of this movement. This is the blessing of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. His prediction is now factually being fulfilled, and those who are sober and conscientious are appreciating the value of this great movement.

### Purport

The magnanimity of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu is expressed in this very important verse. Although He was born in Bengal and Bengalis therefore have a special duty toward Him Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is addressing not only Bengalis but all the inhabitants of India. It is in the land of India that actual human civilization can be developed.

Human life is especially meant for God realization, as stated in the *Vedānta-sūtra: athāto brahma-jijñāsā.* Anyone who takes birth in the land of India (Bhārata-varṣa) has the special privilege of being able to take advantage of the instruction and guidance of the Vedic civilization. He automatically receives the basic principles of spiritual life, for 99.9% of the Indian people, even simple village farmers and others who are neither educated nor sophisticated, believe in the transmigration of the soul, believe in past and future lives, believe in God, and naturally want to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead or His representative. These ideas are the natural inheritance of a person born in India. India has many holy places of pilgrimage, such as Gayā, Benares, Mathurā, Prayāga, Vṛndāvana, Haridvāra, Rāmeśvaram and Jagannātha Purī, and still people go there by the hundreds and thousands. Although the present leaders of India are influencing the people not to believe in God, not to believe in a next life and not to believe in a distinction between pious and impious life, and although they are teaching them how to drink wine, eat meat and become supposedly civilized, people are nevertheless afraid of the four activities of sinful life — namely illicit sex, meat-eating, intoxication and gambling — and whenever there is a religious festival, they gather together by the thousands. We have actual experience of this. Whenever the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement holds a *saṅkīrtana* festival in a big city like Calcutta, Bombay, Madras, Ahmedabad or Hyderabad, thousands of people come to hear. Sometimes we speak in English, but even though most people do not understand English, they nevertheless come to hear us. Even when imitation incarnations of Godhead speak, people gather in the thousands, for everyone who is born in the land of India has a natural spiritual inclination and is taught the basic principles of spiritual life; they merely need to be a little more educated in the Vedic principles. Therefore Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu says here, *janma sārthaka kari’ kara para-upakāra:* if an Indian is educated in the Vedic principles, he is able to perform the most beneficial welfare activity for the entire world.

At present, for want of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, or God consciousness, the entire world is in darkness, having been covered by the four principles of sinful life — meat-eating, illicit sex, gambling and intoxication. Therefore there is a need for vigorous propaganda to educate people to refrain from sinful activities. This will bring peace and prosperity; the rogues, thieves and debauchees will naturally decrease in number, and all of human society will be God conscious.

The practical effect of our spreading the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement all over the world is that now the most degraded debauchees are becoming the most elevated saints. This is only one Indian’s humble service to the world. If all Indians had taken to this path, as advised by Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, India would have given a unique gift to the world, and thus India would have been glorified. Now, however, India is known as a poverty-stricken country, and whenever anyone from America or another opulent country goes to India, he sees many people lying by the footpaths for whom there are not even provisions for two meals a day. There are also institutions collecting money from all parts of the world in the name of welfare activities for poverty-stricken people, but they are spending it for their own sense gratification. Now, on the order of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement has been started, and people are benefiting from this movement. Therefore it is now the duty of the leading men of India to consider the importance of this movement and train many Indians to go outside of India to preach this cult. People will accept it, there will be cooperation among the Indian people and among the other people of the world, and the mission of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu will then be fulfilled. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu will then be glorified all over the world, and people will naturally be happy, peaceful and prosperous, not only in this life but also in the next, for as stated in the *Bhagavad-gītā,* anyone who understands Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, will very easily get salvation, or freedom from the repetition of birth and death, and go back home, back to Godhead. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu therefore requests every Indian to become a preacher of His cult to save the world from disastrous confusion.

This is not only the duty of Indians but the duty of everyone, and we are very happy that American and European boys and girls are seriously cooperating with this movement. One should know definitely that the best welfare activity for all of human society is to awaken man’s God consciousness, or Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Therefore everyone should help this great movement. This is confirmed in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,* Tenth Canto, twenty-second chapter, verse 35, which is next quoted in the *Caitanya-caritāmṛta.*

### Translation

**“ ‘It is the duty of every living being to perform welfare activities for the benefit of others with his life, wealth, intelligence and words.’**

### Purport

There are two kinds of general activities — *śreyas,* or activities which are ultimately beneficial and auspicious, and *preyas,* or those which are immediately beneficial and auspicious. For example, children are fond of playing. They do not want to go to school to receive an education, and they think that to play all day and night and enjoy with their friends is the aim of life. Even in the transcendental life of Lord Kṛṣṇa, we find that when He was a child He was very fond of playing with His friends of the same age, the cowherd boys. He would not even go home to take His dinner. Mother Yaśodā would have to come out to induce Him to come home. Thus it is a child’s nature to engage all day and night in playing, not caring even for his health and other important concerns. This is an example of *preyas,* or immediately beneficial activities. But there are also *śreyas,* or activities which are ultimately auspicious. According to Vedic civilization, a human being must be God conscious. He should understand what God is, what this material world is, who he is, and what their interrelationships are. This is called *śreyas,* or ultimately auspicious activity.

In this verse of *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* it is said that one should be interested in *śreyas.* To achieve the ultimate goal of *śreyas,* or good fortune, one should engage everything, including his life, wealth and words, not only for himself but for others also. However, unless one is interested in *śreyas* in his own life, he cannot preach of *śreyas* for the benefit of others.

This verse cited by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu applies to human beings, not to animals. As indicated in the previous verse by the words *manuṣya-janma,* these injunctions are for human beings. Unfortunately, human beings, although they have the bodies of men, are becoming less than animals in their behavior. This is the fault of modern education. Modern educators do not know the aim of human life; they are simply concerned with how to develop the economic condition of their countries or of human society. This is also necessary; the Vedic civilization considers all aspects of human life, including *dharma* (religion), *artha* (economic development), *kāma* (sense gratification) and *mokṣa* (liberation). But humanity’s first concern should be religion. To be religious, one must abide by the orders of God, but unfortunately people in this age have rejected religion, and they are busy in economic development. Therefore they will adopt any means to get money. For economic development one does not need to get money by hook or by crook; one needs only sufficient money to maintain his body and soul. However, because modern economic development is going on with no religious background, people have become lusty, greedy and mad after money. They are simply developing the qualities of *rajas* (passion) and *tamas* (ignorance), neglecting the other quality of nature, *sattva* (goodness), and the brahminical qualifications. Therefore the entire society is in chaos.

The *Bhāgavatam* says that it is the duty of an advanced human being to act in such a way as to facilitate human society’s attainment of the ultimate goal of life. There is a similar verse in the *Viṣṇu Purāṇa,* part three, chapter twelve, verse 45, which is next quoted in the *Caitanya-caritāmṛta*.

### Translation

**“ ‘By his work, thoughts and words, an intelligent man must perform actions which will be beneficial for all living entities in this life and the next.’**

### Purport

Unfortunately, people in general do not know what is to take place in the next life. To prepare oneself for his next life is common sense, and it is a principle of the Vedic civilization, but presently people throughout the world do not believe in a next life. Even influential professors and other educators say that as soon as the body is finished, everything is finished. This atheistic philosophy is killing human civilization. People are irresponsibly performing all sorts of sinful activities, and thus the privilege of the human life is being taken away by the educational propaganda of the so-called leaders. Actually it is a fact that this life is meant for preparation for the next life; by evolution one has come through many species, or forms, and this human form of life is an opportunity to promote oneself to a better life. This is explained in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (9.25):

*yānti deva-vratā devān* *pitṝn yānti pitṛ-vratāḥ  
bhūtāni yānti bhūtejyā* *yānti mad-yājino ’pi mām*

“Those who worship the demigods will take birth among the demigods; those who worship ghosts and spirits will take birth among such beings; those who worship ancestors go to the ancestors; and those who worship Me will live with Me.” Therefore, one may promote himself to the higher planetary systems, which are the residence of the demigods, one can promote himself to Pitṛloka, one can remain on earth, or one can also go back home, back to Godhead. This is further confirmed elsewhere in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (4.9): *tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti so ’rjuna.* After giving up the body, one who knows Kṛṣṇa in truth does not come back again to this world to accept a material body, but he goes back home, back to Godhead. This knowledge is in the *śāstras,* and people should be given the opportunity to understand it. Even if one is not able to go back to Godhead in one life, the Vedic civilization at least gives one the opportunity to be promoted to the higher planetary systems, where the demigods live, and not glide down again to animal life. At present, people do not understand this knowledge, although it constitutes a great science, for they are uneducated and trained not to accept it. This is the horrible condition of modern human society. As such, the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is the only hope to direct the attention of intelligent men to a greater benefit in life.

### Translation

**“I am merely a gardener. I have neither a kingdom nor very great riches. I simply have some fruits and flowers that I wish to utilize to achieve piety in My life.**

### Purport

In performing welfare activities for human society, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu presents Himself as being not very rich, thus indicating that a man need not be rich or opulent to act for the welfare of humanity. Sometimes rich men are very proud that they can perform beneficial activities for human society whereas others cannot. A practical example is that when there is a scarcity of food in India on account of meager rainfall, some members of the richer class very proudly distribute foodstuffs, making huge arrangements with the help of the government, as if merely by such activities people will be benefited. Suppose there were no food grain. How would the rich men distribute food? Production of grain is completely in the hands of God. If there were no rain, there would be no grain, and these so-called rich men would be unable to distribute grain to the people.

The real purpose of life, therefore, is to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī describes in his *Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu* that devotional service is so exalted that it is beneficial and auspicious for every man. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu also declared that to propagate the *bhakti* cult of devotional service in human society, one does not need to be very rich. Anyone who knows the art can do it and thus render the highest benefit to humanity. Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu takes the part of a gardener because although a gardener is naturally not a very rich man, he has some fruits and flowers. Any man can collect some fruits and flowers and satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead in devotional service, as the Lord recommends in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (9.26):

*patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyaṁ* *yo me bhaktyā prayacchati  
tad ahaṁ bhakty-upahṛtam* *aśnāmi prayatātmanaḥ*

One cannot satisfy the Supreme Lord by his riches, wealth or opulent position, but anyone can collect a little fruit or a flower and offer it to the Lord. The Lord says that if one brings such an offering in devotion, He will accept it and eat it. When Kṛṣṇa eats, the entire world becomes satisfied. There is a story in the *Mahābhārata* illustrating how by Kṛṣṇa’s eating, the sixty thousand disciples of Durvāsā Muni were all satisfied. Therefore it is a fact that if by our life (*prāṇaiḥ*), by our wealth (*arthaiḥ*), by our intelligence (*dhiyā*) or by our words (*vācā*) we can satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead, naturally the entire world will become happy. Therefore our main duty is to satisfy the Supreme Godhead by our actions, our money and our words. This is very simple. Even if one does not have money, he can preach the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra* to everyone. One can go everywhere, to every home, and request everyone to chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra.* Thus the entire world situation will become very happy and peaceful.

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is the most benevolent personality in human society because His only desire is to make people happy. His *saṅkīrtana* movement is especially meant for the purpose of making people happy. He wanted to become the tree Himself because a tree is said to be the most benevolent living entity. In the following verse, which is from *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (10.22.33), Kṛṣṇa Himself highly praises the existence of a tree.

### Translation

**“ ‘Just see how these trees are maintaining every living entity! Their birth is successful. Their behavior is just like that of great personalities, for anyone who asks anything from a tree never goes away disappointed.’ ”**

### Purport

According to Vedic civilization, *kṣatriyas* are considered to be great personalities because if anyone goes to a *kṣatriya* king to ask for charity, the king will never refuse. The trees are compared to those noble *kṣatriyas* because everyone derives all kinds of benefits from them — some people take fruit, others take flowers, others take leaves, others take twigs, and others even cut the tree, and yet the tree gives to everyone without hesitation.

Unnecessarily cutting trees without consideration is another example of human debauchery. The paper industry cuts many hundreds and thousands of trees for its mills, and with the paper so much rubbish literature is published for the whimsical satisfaction of human society. Unfortunately, although these industrialists are now happy in this life by dint of their industrial development, they do not know that they will incur the responsibility for killing these living entities who are in the form of trees.

This verse, quoted from *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,* was spoken by Lord Kṛṣṇa to His friends when He was taking rest underneath a tree after His pastime of stealing the clothes of the *gopīs* (*vastra-haraṇa-līlā*)*.* By quoting this verse, Caitanya Mahāprabhu teaches us that we should be tolerant like trees and also beneficial like trees, which give everything to the needy persons who come underneath them. A needy person may derive many advantages from trees and also from many animals, but in modern civilization people have become so ungrateful that they exploit the trees and animals and kill them. These are some of the sinful activities of modern civilization.

### Purport

It is the desire of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu that the benevolent activities of the *saṅkīrtana* movement, which was inaugurated five hundred years ago in Navadvīpa, be spread all over the world for the benefit of all human beings. Unfortunately, there are many so-called followers of Caitanya Mahāprabhu who are satisfied simply to construct a temple, make a show of the Deities, collect some funds and utilize them for eating and sleeping. There is no question of their preaching the cult of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu all over the world. But even though they are unable to do so, if anyone else does it they become envious. This is the condition of the modern followers of Caitanya Mahāprabhu. The Age of Kali is so strong that it affects even the so-called followers of Lord Caitanya. At least the followers of Caitanya Mahāprabhu must come out of India to preach His cult all over the world, for this is the mission of Lord Caitanya. The followers of Lord Caitanya must execute His will with heart and soul, being more tolerant than the trees and humbler than the straw in the street.

Therefore the members of ISKCON must increase this movement more and more, according to the principles that we are presently trying to execute. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, thus being pleased, will smilingly glance upon them, bestowing His favor, and the movement will be successful.

### Translation

**The great gardener, Lord Caitanya, personally eats this fruit, and as a result He constantly remains mad, as if helpless and bewildered.**

### Purport

It is the mission of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu to act Himself and teach the people. He says, *āpani ācari’ bhakti karila pracāra* (Cc. *Ādi* 4.41). One must first act himself and then teach. This is the function of a real teacher. Unless one is able to understand the philosophy that he speaks, it will not be effective. Therefore one should not only understand the philosophy of the Caitanya cult but also implement it practically in one’s life.

While chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra,* Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu sometimes fainted and remained unconscious for many hours. He prays in His *Śikṣāṣṭaka* (7):

*yugāyitaṁ nimeṣeṇa* *cakṣuṣā prāvṛṣāyitam  
śūnyāyitaṁ jagat sarvaṁ* *govinda-viraheṇa me*

“O Govinda! Feeling Your separation, I am considering a moment to be like twelve years or more. Tears are flowing from My eyes like torrents of rain, and I am feeling all vacant in the world in Your absence.” This is the perfectional stage of chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra* and eating the fruit of love of Godhead, as exhibited by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. One should not artificially imitate this stage, but if one is serious and sincerely follows the regulative principles and chants the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra,* the time will come when these symptoms will appear. Tears will fill his eyes, he will be unable to chant the *mahā-mantra* distinctly, and his heart will throb in ecstasy. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu says that one should not imitate this, but a devotee should long for the day to come when such symptoms of trance will automatically appear in his body.

### Verse text

### Translation

**Persons who had formerly criticized Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, calling Him a drunkard, also ate the fruit and began to dance, saying, “Very good! Very good!”**

### Purport

When Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu started the *saṅkīrtana* movement, even He was unnecessarily criticized by Māyāvādīs, atheists and fools*.* Naturally we are also criticized by such men. They will always remain and will always criticize anything that is actually good for human society. But the preachers of the *saṅkīrtana* movement should not be deterred by such criticism. Our method should be to convert such fools gradually by asking them to come and take *prasādam* and chant and dance with us. This should be our policy. Anyone who comes to join us, of course, must be sincere and serious regarding spiritual advancement in life; then such a person, simply by joining us, chanting with us, dancing with us and taking *prasādam* with us, will gradually also come to say that this movement is very good. But one who joins with an ulterior purpose, to get material benefit or personal gratification, will never be able to grasp the philosophy of this movement.
