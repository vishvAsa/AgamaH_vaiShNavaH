CHAPTER EIGHT

The eighth chapter of *Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta* is summarized by Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura in his *Amṛta-pravāha-bhāṣya.* In this chapter the glories of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and Nityānanda are described, and it is also stated that one who commits offenses in chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra* does not achieve love of Godhead, even after chanting for many years. In this connection, Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura warns against artificial displays of the bodily symptoms called *aṣṭa-sāttvika-vikāra.* That is also an offense. One should seriously and sincerely continue to chant the Pañca-tattva names *śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya prabhu-nityānanda śrī-advaita gadādhara śrīvāsādi-gaura-bhakta-vṛnda.* All these *ācāryas* will bestow their causeless mercy upon a devotee and gradually purify his heart. When he is actually purified, automatically he will experience ecstasy in chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra.* Previous to the composition of *Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta,* Śrīla Vṛndāvana dāsa Ṭhākura wrote a book called *Śrī Caitanya-bhāgavata.* Only those subjects which were not discussed by Śrīla Vṛndāvana dāsa Ṭhākura in his *Caitanya-bhāgavata* have been taken up by Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī to be depicted in *Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta.* In his very old age, Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī went to Vṛndāvana, and by the order of Śrī Madana-mohanajī he wrote *Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta.* Thus we are now able to relish its transcendental bliss.

Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī teaches us first to offer respect to the Pañca-tattva — Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Nityānanda Prabhu, Advaita Prabhu, Gadādhara Prabhu and Śrīvāsa Prabhu and other devotees. We must strictly follow the principle of offering our respects to the Pañca-tattva, as summarized in the *mantra śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya prabhu-nityānanda śrī-advaita gadādhara śrīvāsādi-gaura-bhakta-vṛnda.* At the beginning of every function in preaching, especially before chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra* — Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare — we must chant the Pañca-tattva’s names and offer our respects to them.

### Translation

**By remembering the lotus feet of the Pañca-tattva, a dumb man can become a poet, a lame man can cross mountains, and a blind man can see the stars in the sky.**

### Purport

In Vaiṣṇava philosophy there are three ways for perfection — namely *sādhana-siddha,* perfection attained by executing devotional service according to the rules and regulations, *nitya-siddha,* eternal perfection attained by never forgetting Kṛṣṇa at any time, and *kṛpā-siddha,* perfection attained by the mercy of the spiritual master or another Vaiṣṇava. Kavirāja Gosvāmī here stresses *kṛpā-siddha,* perfection by the mercy of superior authorities. This mercy does not depend on the qualifications of a devotee. By such mercy, even if a devotee is dumb he can speak or write to glorify the Lord splendidly, even if lame he can cross mountains, and even if blind he can see the stars in the sky.

The croaking of the frogs in the rainy season resounds very loudly in the forest, with the result that snakes, hearing the croaking in the darkness, approach the frogs and swallow them. Similarly, the so-called educational vibrations of the tongues of university professors who do not have spiritual knowledge is like the croaking of frogs.

### Verse text

*ei saba nā māne yebā kare kṛṣṇa-bhakti  
kṛṣṇa-kṛpā nāhi tāre, nāhi tāra gati*

### Synonyms

*ei* — these; *saba* — all; *nā* *māne* — does not accept; *yebā* — anyone who; *kare* — executes; *kṛṣṇa*-*bhakti* — devotional service; *kṛṣṇa*-*kṛpā* — mercy of Kṛṣṇa; *nāhi* — is not; *tāre* — unto him; *nāhi* — there is not; *tāra* — his; *gati* — advancement.

### Translation

**One who does not accept the glories of the Pañca-tattva but still makes a show of devotional service to Kṛṣṇa can never achieve the mercy of Kṛṣṇa or advance to the ultimate goal.**

### Purport

If one is seriously interested in Kṛṣṇa conscious activities, he must be ready to follow the rules and regulations laid down by the *ācāryas,* and he must understand their conclusions. The *śāstra* says, *dharmasya tattvaṁ nihitaṁ guhāyāṁ mahā-jano yena gataḥ sa panthāḥ* (*Mahābhārata, Vana-parva* 313.117). It is very difficult to understand the secret of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, but one who advances by the instruction of the previous *ācāryas* and follows in the footsteps of his predecessors in the line of disciplic succession will have success. Others will not. Śrīla Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura says in this connection, *chāḍiyā vaiṣṇava-sevā nistāra peyeche kebā:* “Unless one serves the spiritual master and *ācāryas,* one cannot be liberated.” Elsewhere he says:

*ei chaya gosāñi yāṅra — mui tāṅra dāsa  
tāṅ-sabāra pada-reṇu mora pañca-grāsa*

“I simply accept a person who follows in the footsteps of the six Gosvāmīs, and the dust of such a person’s lotus feet is my food.”

### Synonyms

*pūrve* — formerly; *yaiche* — as it was; *jarāsandha* — King Jarāsandha; *ādi* — heading; *rāja*-*gaṇa* — kings; *veda*-*dharma* — performance of Vedic rituals; *kari’* — doing; *kare* — does; *viṣṇura* — of Lord Viṣṇu; *pūjana* — worship.

### Translation

**Formerly kings like Jarāsandha \[the father-in-law of Kaṁsa\] strictly followed the Vedic rituals, thus worshiping Lord Viṣṇu.**

### Purport

In these verses the author of *Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta,* Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī, is very seriously stressing the importance of worship of the Pañca-tattva. If one becomes a devotee of Gaurasundara or Kṛṣṇa but does not give importance to the Pañca-tattva (*śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya prabhu-nityānanda śrī-advaita gadādhara śrīvāsādi-gaura-bhakta-vṛnda*), his activities are considered to be offenses, or, in the words of Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī, *utpāta* (disturbances). One must therefore be ready to offer due respects to the Pañca-tattva before becoming a devotee of Lord Gaurasundara or of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

### Bengali

कृष्ण नाहि माने, ताते दैत्य करि’ मानि ।

### Verse text

*kṛṣṇa nāhi māne, tāte daitya kari’ māni  
caitanya nā mānile taiche daitya tāre jāni*

### Synonyms

*kṛṣṇa* — Lord Kṛṣṇa; *nāhi* — does not; *māne* — accept; *tāte* — therefore; *daitya* — demon; *kari’* *māni* — we accept; *caitanya* — Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu; *nā* — without; *mānile* — accepting; *taiche* — similarly; *daitya* — demon; *tāre* — to him; *jāni* — we know.

### Translation

**One who does not accept Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead is certainly a demon. Similarly, anyone who does not accept Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu as Kṛṣṇa, the same Supreme Lord, is also to be considered a demon.**

### Purport

Formerly there were kings like Jarāsandha who strictly followed the Vedic rituals, acted as charitable, competent *kṣatriyas,* possessed all *kṣatriya* qualities and were even obedient to the brahminical culture but who did not accept Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Jarāsandha attacked Kṛṣṇa many times, and each time, of course, he was defeated. Like Jarāsandha, any man who performs Vedic rituals but does not accept Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead must be considered an *asura,* or demon. Similarly, one who does not accept Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu as Kṛṣṇa Himself is also a demon. This is the conclusion of authoritative scriptures. Therefore, both so-called devotion to Gaurasundara without devotional service to Kṛṣṇa and so-called *kṛṣṇa-bhakti* without devotional service to Gaurasundara are nondevotional activities. If one wants to be successful on the path of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he must be thoroughly conscious of the personality of Gaurasundara as well as the personality of Kṛṣṇa. Knowing the personality of Gaurasundara means knowing the personalities of *śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya prabhu-nityānanda śrī-advaita gadādhara śrīvāsādi-gaura-bhakta-vṛnda.* The author of *Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta,* pursuant to the authorities, stresses this principle for perfection in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

### Verse text

*more nā mānile saba loka habe nāśa  
ithi lāgi’ kṛpārdra prabhu karila sannyāsa*

### Synonyms

*more* — unto Me; *nā* — without; *mānile* — accepting; *saba* — all; *loka* — people in general; *habe* — will go to; *nāśa* — destruction; *ithi* — for this; *lāgi’* — for the reason of; *kṛpā*-*ārdra* — all merciful; *prabhu* — Lord Caitanya; *karila* — accepted; *sannyāsa* — the *sannyāsa* order.

### Translation

**Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu thought, “Unless people accept Me they will all be destroyed.” Thus the merciful Lord accepted the sannyāsa order.**

### Purport

In *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (12.3.51) it is said, *kīrtanād eva kṛṣṇasya mukta-saṅgaḥ paraṁ vrajet:* “Simply by chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra,* or Lord Kṛṣṇa’s name, one is liberated and goes back home, back to Godhead.” This Kṛṣṇa consciousness must be achieved through the mercy of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. One cannot be complete in Kṛṣṇa consciousness unless he accepts Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and His associates as the only means for success. It is because of these considerations that the Lord accepted *sannyāsa,* for thus people would offer Him respect and very quickly come to the platform of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Since Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, who is Kṛṣṇa Himself, inaugurated the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, without His mercy one cannot be elevated to the transcendental platform of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

### Verse text

*sannyāsi-buddhye more karibe namaskāra  
tathāpi khaṇḍibe duḥkha, pāibe nistāra*

### Synonyms

*sannyāsi*-*buddhye* — by consideration of a *sannyāsī*; *more* — unto Me; *karibe* — they will; *namaskāra* — offer obeisances; *tathāpi* — therefore; *khaṇḍibe* — will diminish; *duḥkha* — distress; *pāibe* — will get; *nistāra* — liberation.

### Translation

**“If a person offers obeisances to Me, even due to accepting Me only as an ordinary sannyāsī, his material distresses will diminish, and he will ultimately get liberation.”**

### Purport

Kṛṣṇa is so merciful that He always thinks of how to liberate the conditioned souls from the material platform. It is for this reason that Kṛṣṇa incarnates, as clearly indicated in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (4.7):

*yadā yadā hi dharmasya* *glānir bhavati bhārata  
abhyutthānam adharmasya* *tadātmānaṁ sṛjāmy aham*

“Whenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice, O descendant of Bharata, and a predominant rise of irreligion — at that time I descend Myself.” Kṛṣṇa always protects the living entities in many ways. He comes Himself, He sends His own confidential devotees, and He leaves behind Him *śāstras* like the *Bhagavad-gītā.* Why? It is so that people may take advantage of the benediction to be liberated from the clutches of *māyā.* Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu accepted *sannyāsa* so that even a foolish person who accepted Him as an ordinary *sannyāsī* would offer Him respect, for this would help diminish his material distresses and ultimately liberate him from the material clutches. Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī points out in this connection that Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya Mahāprabhu is the combined form of Śrī Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa (*mahāprabhu śrī-caitanya, rādhā-kṛṣṇa — nahe anya*). Therefore when fools considered Caitanya Mahāprabhu to be an ordinary human being and thus treated Him disrespectfully, the merciful Lord, in order to deliver these offenders, accepted *sannyāsa* so that they would offer Him obeisances, accepting Him as a *sannyāsī.* Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu accepted *sannyāsa* to bestow His great mercy on people in general, who cannot appreciate Him as Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa Themselves.

### Verse text

*hena kṛpāmaya caitanya nā bhaje yei jana  
sarvottama ha-ileo tāre asure gaṇana*

### Synonyms

*hena* — such; *kṛpāmaya* — merciful; *caitanya* — Lord Śrī Caitanya; *nā* — does not; *bhaje* — worship; *yei* — one; *jana* — person; *sarvottama* — supreme; *ha*-*ileo* — in spite of his being; *tāre* — unto him; *asure* — among the demons; *gaṇana* — the calculation.

### Translation

**One who does not show respect unto this merciful Lord, Caitanya Mahāprabhu, or does not worship Him should be considered a demon, even if he is very much exalted in human society.**

### Purport

Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Mahārāja says in this connection: “O living entities, simply engage yourselves in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. This is the message of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.” Lord Caitanya preached this cult, instructing the philosophy of Kṛṣṇa consciousness in His eight verses, or *Śikṣāṣṭaka,* and He said, *ihā haite sarva-siddhi haibe sabāra:* “By chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra,* one will get all perfection in life.” Therefore one who does not show Him respect or cannot appreciate His mercy despite all these merciful gestures is an *asura,* or opponent of bona fide devotional service to Lord Viṣṇu, even though he may be very much exalted in human society. The word *asura* refers to one who is against devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Viṣṇu. It should be noted that unless one worships Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu it is useless to become a devotee of Kṛṣṇa, and unless one worships Kṛṣṇa it is also useless to become a devotee of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Such devotional service is to be understood to be a product of Kali-yuga. Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura remarks in this connection that atheist *smārtas,* or worshipers of the five kinds of demigods, worship Lord Viṣṇu for a little satisfaction in material success but have no respect for Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Thinking Him to be one of the ordinary living entities, they discriminate between Gaurasundara and Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Such understanding is also demoniac and is against the conclusion of the *ācāryas.* Such a conclusion is a product of Kali-yuga.

### Translation

**Therefore I say again, lifting my arms: O fellow human beings, please worship Śrī Caitanya and Nityānanda without false arguments!**

### Purport

Because a person who performs *kṛṣṇa-bhakti* but does not understand Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya and Prabhu Nityānanda will simply waste his time, the author, Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī, requests everyone to take to the worship of Śrī Caitanya and Nityānanda Prabhu and the Pañca-tattva. He assures everyone that any person who does so will be successful in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

### Translation

**If you are indeed interested in logic and argument, kindly apply it to the mercy of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. If you do so, you will find it to be strikingly wonderful.**

### Purport

Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura comments in this connection that people in general, in their narrow-minded conception of life, create many different types of humanitarian activities, but the humanitarian activities inaugurated by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu are different. For logicians who want to accept only that which is proven through logic and argument, it is a fact that without logic and reason there can be no question of accepting the Absolute Truth. Unfortunately, when such logicians take to this path without the mercy of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, they remain on the platform of logic and argument and do not advance in spiritual life. However, if one is intelligent enough to apply his arguments and logic to the subtle understanding of the fundamental spiritual substance, he will be able to know that a poor fund of knowledge established on the basis of material logic cannot help one understand the Absolute Truth, which is beyond the reach of imperfect senses. The *Mahābhārata* therefore says, *acintyāḥ khalu ye bhāvā na tāṁs tarkeṇa yojayet.* (*Mahābhārata, Bhīṣma-parva* 5.22) How can that which is beyond the imagination or sensory speculation of mundane creatures be approached simply by logic? Logic and argument are very poor in spiritual strength and always imperfect when applied to spiritual understanding. By putting forward mundane logic one frequently comes to the wrong conclusion regarding the Absolute Truth, and as a result of such a conclusion one may fall down to accept a body like that of a jackal.

Despite all this, those who are actually inquisitive to understand the philosophy of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu through logic and argument are welcome. Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī addresses them, “Please put Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s mercy to your crucial test, and if you are actually a logician you will come to the right conclusion that there is no personality more merciful than Lord Caitanya.” Let the logicians compare all the results of other humanitarian work with the merciful activities of Lord Caitanya. If their judgment is impartial, they will understand that no other humanitarian activities can surpass those of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

Everyone is engaged in humanitarian activities on the basis of the body, but from the *Bhagavad-gītā* (2.18) we understand, *anta-vanta ime dehā nityasyoktāḥ śarīriṇaḥ:* “The material body is ultimately subject to destruction, whereas the spiritual soul is eternal.” Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s philanthropic activities are performed in connection with the eternal soul. However one tries to benefit the body, it will be destroyed, and one will have to accept another body according to his present activities. If one does not, therefore, understand this science of transmigration but considers the body to be all in all, his intelligence is not very advanced. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, without neglecting the necessities of the body, imparted spiritual advancement to purify the existential condition of humanity. Therefore if a logician makes his judgment impartially, he will surely find that Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is the *mahā-vadānyāvatāra,* the most magnanimous incarnation. He is even more magnanimous than Lord Kṛṣṇa Himself. Lord Kṛṣṇa demanded that one surrender unto Him, but He did not distribute love of Godhead as magnanimously as Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Therefore Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī offers Lord Caitanya his respectful obeisances with the words *namo mahā-vadānyāya kṛṣṇa-prema-pradāya te/ kṛṣṇāya kṛṣṇa-caitanya-nāmne gaura-tviṣe namaḥ.* Lord Kṛṣṇa simply gave the *Bhagavad-gītā,* by which one can understand Lord Kṛṣṇa as He is, but Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, who is also Kṛṣṇa Himself, gave people love of Kṛṣṇa without discrimination.

### Purport

Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura says in this connection that although one may go on chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra* for many, many years, there is no possibility of attaining the platform of devotional service unless one accepts Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. One must follow strictly the instruction of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu given in the *Śikṣāṣṭaka* (3):

*tṛṇād api su-nīcena* *taror iva sahiṣṇunā  
amāninā māna-dena* *kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ*

“One should chant the holy name of the Lord in a humble state of mind, thinking oneself lower than the straw in the street; one should be more tolerant than a tree, devoid of all sense of false prestige, and should be ready to offer all respect to others. In such a state of mind one can chant the holy name of the Lord constantly.” One who follows this direction, being freed from the ten kinds of offenses, becomes successful in Kṛṣṇa consciousness and ultimately reaches the platform of loving service to the Personality of Godhead.

One must come to the understanding that the holy name of the Lord and the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself are identical. One cannot reach this conclusion unless one is offenseless in chanting the holy name. By our material calculation we see a difference between the name and the substance, but in the spiritual world the Absolute is always absolute: the name, form, qualities and pastimes of the Absolute are all as good as the Absolute Himself. Thus one is understood to be an eternal servant of the Supreme Personality of Godhead if he considers himself an eternal servant of the holy name and in this spirit distributes the holy name to the world. One who chants in that spirit, without offenses, is certainly elevated to the platform of understanding that the holy name and the Personality of Godhead are identical. To associate with the holy name and chant the holy name is to associate with the Personality of Godhead directly. In the *Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu* it is clearly said, *sevonmukhe hi jihvādau svayam eva sphuraty adaḥ.* The holy name becomes manifest when one engages in the service of the holy name. This service in a submissive attitude begins with one’s tongue. *Sevonmukhe hi jihvādau:* One must engage his tongue in the service of the holy name. Our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is based on this principle. We try to engage all the members of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement in the service of the holy name. Since the holy name and Kṛṣṇa are nondifferent, the members of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement not only chant the holy name of the Lord offenselessly, but also do not allow their tongues to eat anything that is not first offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Supreme Lord declares:

*patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyaṁ* *yo me bhaktyā prayacchati  
tad ahaṁ bhakty-upahṛtaṁ* *aśnāmi prayatātmanaḥ*

“If one offers Me with love and devotion a leaf, a flower, a fruit or water, I will accept it.” (Bg. 9.26) Therefore the International Society for Krishna Consciousness has many temples all over the world, and in each and every temple the Lord is offered these foods. On the basis of His demands, the devotees chant the holy name of the Lord offenselessly and never eat anything that is not first offered to the Lord. The functions of the tongue in devotional service are to chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra* and eat *prasādam* that is offered to the Lord.

*jñānataḥ su-labhā muktir  
bhuktir yajñādi-puṇyataḥ

### Synonyms

*jñānataḥ* — by cultivation of knowledge; *su*-*labhā* — easily obtainable; *muktiḥ* — liberation; *bhuktiḥ* — sense enjoyment; *yajña*-*ādi* — performance of sacrifices, etc.; *puṇyataḥ* — and by performing pious activities; *sā* — that; *iyam* — this; *sādhana*-*sāhasraiḥ* — execution of thousands of sacrifices; *hari*-*bhaktiḥ* — devotional service; *su*-*durlabhā* — is very rare.

### Translation

**“By cultivating philosophical knowledge one can understand his spiritual position and thus be liberated, and by performing sacrifices and pious activities one can achieve sense gratification in a higher planetary system, but the devotional service of the Lord is so rare that even by executing hundreds and thousands of such sacrifices one cannot obtain it.”**

### Purport

Prahlāda Mahārāja instructs:

*matir na kṛṣṇe parataḥ svato vā *
 *mitho ’bhipadyeta gṛha-vratānām*

(*Bhāg.* 7.5.30)

*naiṣāṁ matis tāvad urukramāṅghriṁ *
 *spṛśaty anarthāpagamo yad-arthaḥ  
mahīyasāṁ pāda-rajo-’bhiṣekaṁ *
 *niṣkiñcanānāṁ na vṛṇīta yāvat*

(*Bhāg.* 7.5.32)

These *ślokas* are to be discussed. Their purport is that one cannot obtain *kṛṣṇa-bhakti,* or the devotional service of the Lord, by official execution of the Vedic rituals. One has to approach a pure devotee. Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura sings, *chāḍiyā vaiṣṇava-sevā nistāra pāyeche kebā:* “Who has been elevated without rendering service to a pure Vaiṣṇava?” It is the statement of Prahlāda Mahārāja that unless one is able to accept the dust from the lotus feet of a pure Vaiṣṇava there is no possibility of achieving the platform of devotional service. That is the secret. The above-mentioned *tantra-vacana,* quoted from the *Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu* (1.1.36), is our perfect guidance in this connection.

### Translation

**\[The great sage Śukadeva said:\] “My dear Mahārāja Parīkṣit, the Supreme Personality of Godhead Kṛṣṇa is always ready to help you. He is your master, guru, God, and very dear friend, and also the head of your family. Yet sometimes He agrees to act as your servant or order-carrier. You are greatly fortunate because this relationship is possible only by bhakti-yoga. The Lord can give liberation \[mukti\] very easily, but He does not very easily give one bhakti-yoga, because by that process He is bound to the devotee.”**

### Purport

This passage is a quotation from *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (5.6.18). While Śukadeva Gosvāmī was describing the character of Ṛṣabhadeva, he distinguished between *bhakti-yoga* and liberation by reciting this verse. In relationship with the Yadus and Pāṇḍavas, the Lord acted sometimes as their master, sometimes as their advisor, sometimes as their friend, sometimes as the head of their family and sometimes even as their servant. Kṛṣṇa once had to carry out an order of Yudhiṣṭhira’s by carrying a letter Yudhiṣṭhira had written to Duryodhana regarding peace negotiations. Similarly, He also became the chariot driver of Arjuna. This illustrates that in *bhakti-yoga* there is a relationship established between the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the devotee. Such a relationship is established in the transcendental mellows known as *dāsya, sakhya, vātsalya* and *mādhurya.* If a devotee wants simple liberation, he gets it very easily from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as confirmed by Bilvamaṅgala Ṭhākura. *Muktiḥ svayaṁ mukulitāñjali sevate ’smān:* for a devotee, *mukti* is not very important because *mukti* is always standing on his doorstep waiting to serve him in some way. A devotee, therefore, must be attracted by the behavior of the inhabitants of Vṛndāvana, who live in a relationship with Kṛṣṇa. The land, water, cows, trees and flowers serve Kṛṣṇa in *śānta-rasa,* His servants serve Him in *dāsya-rasa,* and His cowherd friends serve Him in *sakhya-rasa.* Similarly, the elder *gopīs* and *gopas* serve Kṛṣṇa as father and mother, uncle and other relatives, and the young *gopīs,* the cowherd girls, serve Kṛṣṇa in conjugal love.

While executing devotional service, one must be naturally inclined to serve Kṛṣṇa in one of these transcendental relationships. That is the actual success of life. For a devotee, to get liberation is not very difficult. Even one who is unable to establish a relationship with Kṛṣṇa can achieve liberation by merging into the Brahman effulgence. This is called *sāyujya-mukti.* Vaiṣṇavas never accept *sāyujya-mukti,* although sometimes they accept the other forms of liberation, namely *sārūpya, sālokya, sāmīpya* and *sārṣṭi.* A pure devotee, however, does not accept any kind of *mukti.* He wants only to serve Kṛṣṇa in a transcendental relationship. This is the perfectional stage of spiritual life. Māyāvādī philosophers desire to merge into the existence of the Brahman effulgence, although this aspect of liberation is always neglected by devotees. Śrīla Prabodhānanda Sarasvatī Ṭhākura, describing this kind of *mukti,* which is called *kaivalya,* or becoming one with the Supreme, has said, *kaivalyaṁ narakāyate:* “Becoming one with the Supreme is as good as going to hell.” Therefore the ideal of Māyāvāda philosophy, becoming one with the Supreme, is hellish for a devotee; he never accepts it. Māyāvādī philosophers do not know that even if they merge into the effulgence of the Supreme, this will not give them ultimate rest. An individual soul cannot live in the Brahman effulgence in a state of inactivity; after some time, he must desire to be active. However, since he is not aware of his relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead and therefore has no spiritual activity, he must come down for further activities in this material world. This is confirmed in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (10.2.32):

*āruhya kṛcchreṇa paraṁ padaṁ tataḥ *
 *patanty adho ’nādṛta-yuṣmad-aṅghrayaḥ*

Because Māyāvādī philosophers have no information regarding the transcendental service of the Lord, even after attaining liberation from material activities and merging into the Brahman effulgence, they must come down again to this material world to open hospitals or schools or perform similar philanthropic activities.

हेन प्रेम श्रीचैतन्य दिला यथा तथा ।

*hena prema śrī-caitanya dilā yathā tathā  
jagāi mādhāi paryanta — anyera kā kathā*

### Synonyms

*hena* — such; *prema* — love of Godhead; *śrī*-*caitanya* — Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu; *dilā* — has given; *yathā* — anywhere; *tathā* — everywhere; *jagāi* — Jagāi; *mādhāi* — Mādhāi; *paryanta* — up to them; *anyera* — of others; *kā* — what to speak; *kathā* — words.

### Translation

**Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu has freely given this love of Kṛṣṇa everywhere and anywhere, even to the most fallen, such as Jagāi and Mādhāi. What then to speak of those who are already pious and elevated?**

### Purport

The distinction between Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s gift to human society and the gifts of others is that whereas so-called philanthropic and humanitarian workers have given some relief to human society as far as the body is concerned, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu offers the best facilities for going back home, back to Godhead, with love of Godhead. If one seriously makes a comparative study of the two gifts, certainly if he is at all sober he will give the greatest credit to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. It was with this purpose that Kavirāja Gosvāmī said:

*śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya-dayā karaha vicāra  
vicāra karile citte pābe camatkāra*

“If you are indeed interested in logic and argument, kindly apply it to the mercy of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. If you do so, you will find it to be strikingly wonderful.” (Cc. *Ādi* 8.15)

Śrīla Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura says:

*dīna-hīna yata chila,* *hari-nāme uddhārila,  
tāra sākṣī jagāi mādhāi*

The two brothers Jagāi and Mādhāi epitomize the sinful population of this Age of Kali. They were most disturbing elements in society because they were meat-eaters, drunkards, woman-hunters, rogues and thieves. Yet Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu delivered them, to say nothing of others who were sober, pious, devoted and conscientious. The *Bhagavad-gītā* confirms that to say nothing of the brahminically qualified devotees and *rājarṣis* (*kiṁ punar brāhmaṇāḥ puṇyā bhaktā rājarṣayas tathā*), anyone who by the association of a pure devotee comes to Kṛṣṇa consciousness becomes eligible to go back home, back to Godhead. In the *Bhagavad-gītā* (9.32) the Lord thus declares:

*māṁ hi pārtha vyapāśritya* *ye ’pi syuḥ pāpa-yonayaḥ  
striyo vaiśyās tathā śūdrās* *te ’pi yānti parāṁ gatim*

“O son of Pṛthā, those who take shelter in Me, though they be of lower birth — women, *vaiśyas* \[merchants\] and *śūdras* \[workers\] — can attain the supreme destination.”

Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu delivered the two fallen brothers Jagāi and Mādhāi, but the entire world is presently full of Jagāis and Mādhāis, or, in other words, woman-hunters, meat-eaters, gamblers, thieves and other rogues, who create all kinds of disturbances in society. The activities of such persons have now become common practices. It is no longer considered abominable to be a drunkard, woman-hunter, meat-eater, thief or rogue, for these elements have been assimilated by human society. That does not mean, however, that the abominable qualities of such persons will help free human society from the clutches of *māyā.* Rather, they will entangle humanity more and more in the reactions of the stringent laws of material nature. One’s activities are all performed under the influence of the modes of material nature (*prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ*)*.* Because people are now associating with the modes of ignorance (*tamo-guṇa*) and, to some extent, passion (*rajo-guṇa*), with no trace of goodness (*sattva-guṇa*), they are becoming increasingly greedy and lusty, for that is the effect of associating with these modes. *Tadā rajas-tamo-bhavāḥ kāma-lobhādayaś ca ye:* “By associating with the two lower qualities of material nature, one becomes lusty and greedy.” (*Bhāg.* 1.2.19) Actually, in modern human society, everyone is greedy and lusty, and therefore the only means for deliverance is Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s *saṅkīrtana* movement, which can promote all the Jagāis and Mādhāis to the topmost position of *sattva-guṇa,* or brahminical culture.

*Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (1.2.18-19) states:

*naṣṭa-prāyeṣv abhadreṣu* *nityaṁ bhāgavata-sevayā  
bhagavaty uttama-śloke* *bhaktir bhavati naiṣṭhikī*

*tadā rajas-tamo-bhāvāḥ* *kāma-lobhādayaś ca ye  
ceta etair anāviddhaṁ* *sthitaṁ sattve prasīdati*

Considering the chaotic condition of human society, if one actually wants peace and tranquillity, one must take to the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement and engage always in *bhāgavata-dharma.* Engagement in *bhāgavata-dharma* dissipates all ignorance and passion, and when ignorance and passion are dissipated one is freed from greed and lust. When freed from greed and lust, one becomes brahminically qualified, and when a brahminically qualified person makes further advancement, he becomes situated on the Vaiṣṇava platform. It is only on this Vaiṣṇava platform that it is possible to awaken one’s dormant love of Godhead, and as soon as one does so, his life is successful.

At present, human society is specifically cultivating the mode of ignorance (*tamo-guṇa*), although there may also be some symptoms of passion (*rajo-guṇa*)*.* Full of *kāma* and *lobha,* lust and greed, the entire population of the world consists mostly of *śūdras* and a few *vaiśyas,* and gradually it is coming about that there are *śūdras* only. Communism is a movement of *śūdras,* and capitalism is meant for *vaiśyas.* In the fighting between these two factions, the *śūdras* and *vaiśyas,* gradually, due to the abominable condition of society, the communists will emerge triumphant, and as soon as this takes place, whatever is left of society will be ruined. The only possible remedy that can counteract the tendency toward communism is the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, which can give even communists the real idea of communist society. According to the doctrine of communism, the state should be the proprietor of everything. But the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, expanding this same idea, accepts God as the proprietor of everything. People cannot understand this because they have no sense of God, but the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement can help them to understand God and to understand that everything belongs to God. Since everything is the property of God, and all living entities — not only human beings but even animals, birds, plants and so on — are children of God, everyone has the right to live at the cost of God with God consciousness. This is the sum and substance of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement.

### Translation

**Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself, is fully independent. Therefore, although it is the most confidentially stored benediction, He can distribute love of Godhead to anyone and everyone without consideration.**

### Purport

This is the benefit of Lord Caitanya’s movement. If one somehow or other comes in contact with the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement, without consideration of his being a *śūdra, vaiśya,* Jagāi, Mādhāi or even lower, he becomes advanced in spiritual consciousness and immediately develops love of Godhead. We now have actual experience that throughout the entire world this movement is making many such persons lovers of God simply by the chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra.* Actually, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu has appeared as the spiritual master of the entire world. He does not discriminate between offenders and the innocent. *Kṛṣṇa-prema-pradāya te:* He liberally gives love of Godhead to anyone and everyone. This can be actually experienced, as stated in the next verse.

### Translation

**Whether he is offensive or inoffensive, anyone who even now chants śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya prabhu-nityānanda is immediately overwhelmed with ecstasy, and tears fill his eyes.**

### Purport

The *prākṛta-sahajiyās* who chant *nitāi-gaura rādhe śyāma* have very little knowledge of the *Bhāgavata* conclusion, and they hardly follow the Vaiṣṇava rules and regulations, and yet because they chant *bhaja nitāi-gaura,* their chanting immediately evokes tears and other signs of ecstasy. Although they do not know the principles of Vaiṣṇava philosophy and are not very much advanced in education, by these symptoms they attract many men to become their followers. Their ecstatic tears will of course help them in the long run, for as soon as they come in contact with a pure devotee their lives will become successful. Even in the beginning, however, because they are chanting the holy names of *nitāi-gaura,* their swift advancement on the path of love of Godhead is very prominently visible.

### Translation

**There are offenses to be considered while chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra. Therefore simply by chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa one does not become ecstatic.**

### Purport

It is very beneficial to chant the names *śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya prabhu-nityānanda* before chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra* because by chanting these two holy names — *śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya prabhu-nityānanda* — one immediately becomes ecstatic, and if he then chants the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra* he becomes free of offenses.

There are ten offenses to avoid in chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra.* The first offense is to blaspheme great personalities who are engaged in distributing the holy name of the Lord. It is said in the *śāstra* (Cc. *Antya* 7.11), *kṛṣṇa-śakti vinā nahe tāra pravartana:* one cannot distribute the holy names of the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra* unless he is empowered by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore one should not criticize or blaspheme a devotee who is thus engaged.

*Śrī Padma Purāṇa* states:

*satāṁ nindā nāmnaḥ paramam aparādhaṁ vitanute *
 *yataḥ khyātiṁ yātaṁ katham u sahate tad-vigarhām*

To blaspheme the great saintly persons who are engaged in preaching the glories of the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra* is the worst offense at the lotus feet of the holy name. One should not criticize a preacher of the glories of the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra.* If one does so, he is an offender. The Nāma-prabhu, who is identical with Kṛṣṇa, will never tolerate such blasphemous activities, even from one who passes as a great devotee.

The second *nāmāparādha* is described as follows:

*śivasya śrī-viṣṇor ya iha guṇa-nāmādi-sakalaṁ *
 *dhiyā bhinnaṁ paśyet sa khalu hari-nāmāhita-karaḥ*

In this material world, the holy name of Viṣṇu is all-auspicious. Viṣṇu’s name, form, qualities and pastimes are all transcendental, absolute knowledge. Therefore, if one tries to separate the Absolute Personality of Godhead from His holy name or His transcendental form, qualities and pastimes, thinking them to be material, that is offensive. Similarly, to think that the names of demigods such as Lord Śiva are as good as the name of Lord Viṣṇu — or, in other words, to think that Lord Śiva and the other demigods are other forms of God and are therefore equal to Viṣṇu — is also blasphemous. This is the second offense at the lotus feet of the holy name of the Lord.

The third offense at the lotus feet of the holy name, which is called *guror avajñā,* is to consider the spiritual master to be material and therefore to envy his exalted position. The fourth offense (*śruti-śāstra-nindanam*) is to blaspheme Vedic literatures such as the four *Vedas* and the *Purāṇas.* The fifth offense (*artha-vādaḥ*) is to consider the glories of the holy name to be exaggerations. Similarly, the sixth offense (*hari-nāmni kalpanam*) is to consider the holy name of the Lord to be imaginary.

The seventh offense is described as follows:

*nāmno balād yasya hi pāpa-buddhir *
 *na vidyate tasya yamair hi śuddhiḥ*

To think that since the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra* can counteract all sinful reactions one may therefore go on with his sinful activities and at the same time chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra* to neutralize them is the greatest offense at the lotus feet of *hari-nāma.*

The eighth offense is stated thus:

*dharma-vrata-tyāga-hutādi-sarva- *
 *śubha-kriyā-sāmyam api pramādaḥ*

It is offensive to consider the chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra* to be a religious ritualistic ceremony. Performing religious ceremonies, following vows and practicing renunciation and sacrifice are all materialistic auspicious activities. The chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra* must not be compared to such materialistic religiosity. This is an offense at the lotus feet of the holy name of the Lord.

The ninth offense is described as follows:

*aśraddadhāne vimukhe ’py aśṛṇvati *
 *yaś copadeśaḥ śiva-nāmāparādhaḥ*

It is an offense to preach the glories of the holy name among persons who have no intelligence or no faith in the subject matter. Such people should be given the chance to hear the chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra,* but in the beginning they should not be instructed about the glories or the spiritual significance of the holy name. By constant hearing of the holy name, their hearts will be purified, and then they will be able to understand the transcendental position of the holy name.

The tenth offense is as follows:

*śrute ’pi nāma-māhātmye* *yaḥ prīti-rahito naraḥ  
ahaṁ-mamādi-paramo* *nāmni so ’py aparādha-kṛt*

If one has heard the glories of the transcendental holy name of the Lord but nevertheless continues in a materialistic concept of life, thinking “I am this body and everything belonging to this body is mine \[*ahaṁ mameti*\],” and does not show respect and love for the chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra,* that is an offense.

*tad aśma-sāraṁ hṛdayaṁ batedaṁ  
yad gṛhyamāṇair hari-nāma-dheyaiḥ  
na vikriyetātha yadā vikāro  
netre jalaṁ gātra-ruheṣu harṣaḥ*

### Synonyms

*tat* — that; *aśma*-*sāram* — as hard as iron; *hṛdayam* — heart; *bata* — O; *idam* — this; *yat* — which; *gṛhyamāṇaiḥ* — in spite of taking the chanting; *hari*-*nāma*-*dheyaiḥ* — meditating on the holy name of the Lord; *na* — does not; *vikriyeta* — change; *atha* — thus; *yadā* — when; *vikāraḥ* — transformation; *netre* — in the eyes; *jalam* — tears; *gātra*-*ruheṣu* — in the pores of the body; *harṣaḥ* — ecstasy.

### Translation

**“If one’s heart does not change, tears do not flow from his eyes, his body does not shiver, and his bodily hairs do not stand on end as he chants the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra, it should be understood that his heart is as hard as iron. This is due to his offenses at the lotus feet of the Lord’s holy name.”**

### Purport

Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura, commenting on this verse, which is a quotation from *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (2.3.24), remarks that sometimes a *mahā-bhāgavata,* or very advanced devotee, does not manifest such transcendental symptoms as tears in the eyes, whereas sometimes a *kaniṣṭha-adhikārī,* a neophyte devotee, displays them artificially. This does not mean, however, that the neophyte is more advanced than the *mahā-bhāgavata* devotee. The test of the real change of heart that takes place when one chants the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra* is that one becomes detached from material enjoyment. This is the real change. *Bhaktiḥ pareśānubhavo viraktir anyatra ca* (*Bhāg.* 11.2.42)*.* If one is actually advancing in spiritual life, he must become very much detached from material enjoyment. If it is sometimes found that a *kaniṣṭha-adhikārī* (neophyte devotee) shows artificial tears in his eyes while chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra* but is still completely attached to material things, his heart has not really changed. The change must be manifested in terms of one’s real activities.

‘एक’ कृष्णनामे करे सर्वपाप नाश ।  
प्रेमेर कारण भक्ति करेन प्रकाश ॥ २६ ॥

### Verse text

*‘eka’ kṛṣṇa-nāme kare sarva-pāpa nāśa  
premera kāraṇa bhakti karena prakāśa*

### Synonyms

*eka* — one; *kṛṣṇa*-*nāme* — by chanting the holy name of Lord Kṛṣṇa; *kare* — makes; *sarva* — all; *pāpa* — sinful life; *nāśa* — exhausted; *premera* — of love of Godhead; *kāraṇa* — cause; *bhakti* — devotional service; *karena* — becomes; *prakāśa* — manifest.

### Translation

**Simply chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra without offenses vanquishes all sinful activities. Thus pure devotional service, which is the cause of love of Godhead, becomes manifest.**

### Purport

One cannot be situated in the devotional service of the Lord unless one is free from sinful life. This is confirmed in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (7.28):

*yeṣāṁ tv anta-gataṁ pāpaṁ* *janānāṁ puṇya-karmanām  
te dvandva-moha-nirmuktā* *bhajante māṁ dṛḍha-vratāḥ*

“Persons who have acted piously in previous lives and in this life and whose sinful actions are completely eradicated are freed from the duality of delusion, and they engage themselves in My service with determination.” A person who is already cleansed of all tinges of sinful life engages without deviation or duality of purpose in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. In this age, although people are greatly sinful, simply chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra* can relieve them from the reactions of their sins. *Eka kṛṣṇa-nāme:* only by chanting Kṛṣṇa’s name is this possible. This is confirmed in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (12.3.51): *kīrtanād eva kṛṣṇasya mukta-saṅgaḥ.* Caitanya Mahāprabhu has also taught us this. While passing on the road, He used to chant:

*kṛṣṇa kṛṣṇa kṛṣṇa kṛṣṇa kṛṣṇa kṛṣṇa kṛṣṇa he  
kṛṣṇa kṛṣṇa kṛṣṇa kṛṣṇa kṛṣṇa kṛṣṇa kṛṣṇa he  
kṛṣṇa kṛṣṇa kṛṣṇa kṛṣṇa kṛṣṇa kṛṣṇa rakṣa mām  
kṛṣṇa kṛṣṇa kṛṣṇa kṛṣṇa kṛṣṇa kṛṣṇa pāhi mām  
rāma rāghava rāma rāghava rāma rāghava rakṣa mām  
kṛṣṇa keśava kṛṣṇa keśava kṛṣṇa keśava pāhi mām*

If one always chants the holy name of Kṛṣṇa, gradually one is freed from all reactions of sinful life, provided he chants offenselessly and does not commit more sinful activities on the strength of chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra.* In this way one is purified, and his devotional service causes the arousal of his dormant love of God. If one simply chants the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra* and does not commit sinful activities and offenses, one’s life is purified, and thus one comes to the fifth stage of perfection, or engagement in the loving service of the Lord (*premā pum-artho mahān*)*.*

### Synonyms

*premera* — of love of Godhead; *udaye* — when there is awakening; *haya* — it becomes so; *premera* — of love of Godhead; *vikāra* — transformation; *sveda* — perspiration; *kampa* — trembling; *pulaka*-*ādi* — throbbing of the heart; *gadgada* — faltering; *aśru*-*dhāra* — tears in the eyes.

### Translation

**When one’s transcendental loving service to the Lord is actually awakened, it generates transformations in the body such as perspiration, trembling, throbbing of the heart, faltering of the voice and tears in the eyes.**

### Purport

These bodily transformations are automatically manifested when one is actually situated in love of Godhead. One should not artificially imitate them. Our disease is desire for that which is material; even while advancing in spiritual life, we want material acclaim. One must be freed from this disease. Pure devotion must be *anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyam,* without desire for anything material. Advanced devotees manifest many bodily transformations, which are symptoms of ecstasy, but one should not imitate them to achieve cheap adoration from the public. When one actually attains the advanced stage, the ecstatic symptoms will appear automatically; one does not need to imitate them.

### Translation

**As a result of chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra, one makes such great advancement in spiritual life that simultaneously his material existence terminates and he receives love of Godhead. The holy name of Kṛṣṇa is so powerful that by chanting even one name, one very easily achieves these transcendental riches.**

### Translation

**If one chants the exalted holy name of the Lord again and again and yet his love for the Supreme Lord does not develop and tears do not appear in his eyes, it is evident that because of his offenses in chanting, the seed of the holy name of Kṛṣṇa does not sprout.**

### Purport

If one chants the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra* offensively, one does not achieve the desired result. Therefore one should carefully avoid the offenses, which have already been described in connection with verse 24.

चैतन्य–नित्यानन्दे नाहि एसव विचार ।

### Verse text

*caitanya-nityānande nāhi e-saba vicāra  
nāma laite prema dena, vahe aśrudhāra*

### Synonyms

*caitanya*-*nityānande* — when chanting the holy names of Lord Caitanya and Nityānanda; *nāhi* — there are not; *e*-*saba* — all these; *vicara* — considerations; *nāma* — the holy name; *laite* — simply by chanting; *prema* — love of Godhead; *dena* — they give; *vahe* — there is a flow; *aśru*-*dhāra* — tears in the eyes.

### Translation

**But if one only chants, with some slight faith, the holy names of Lord Caitanya and Nityānanda, very quickly he is cleansed of all offenses. Thus as soon as he chants the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra, he feels the ecstasy of love for God.**

### Purport

Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura remarks in this connection that if one takes shelter of Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and Nityānanda, follows Their instructions to become more tolerant than the tree and humbler than the grass, and in this way chants the holy name of the Lord, very soon he achieves the platform of transcendental loving service to the Lord, and tears appear in his eyes. There are offenses to be considered in chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra,* but there are no such considerations in chanting the names of Gaura-Nityānanda. Therefore, if one chants the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra* but his life is still full of sinful activities, it will be very difficult for him to achieve the platform of loving service to the Lord. But if in spite of being an offender one chants the holy names of Gaura-Nityānanda, he is very quickly freed from the reactions to his offenses. Therefore, one should first approach Lord Caitanya and Nityānanda, or worship Guru-Gaurāṅga, and then come to the stage of worshiping Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa. In our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, our students are first advised to worship Guru-Gaurāṅga, and then, when they are somewhat advanced, the Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa Deity is installed, and they are engaged in the worship of the Lord.

One should first take shelter of Gaura-Nityānanda in order to reach, ultimately, Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa. Śrīla Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura sings in this connection:

*gaurāṅga balite ha’be pulaka śarīra  
hari hari balite nayane ba’be nīra*

*āra kabe nitāi-cāṅdera karuṇā ha-ibe  
saṁsāra-vāsanā mora kabe tuccha habe*

*viṣaya chāḍiyā kabe śuddha habe mana  
kabe hāma heraba śrī-vṛndāvana*

In the beginning one should very regularly chant Śrī Gaurasundara’s holy name and then chant the holy name of Lord Nityānanda. Thus one’s heart will be cleansed of impure desires for material enjoyment. Then one can approach Vṛndāvana-dhāma to worship Lord Kṛṣṇa. Unless one is favored by Lord Caitanya and Nityānanda, there is no need to go to Vṛndāvana, for unless one’s mind is purified, he cannot see Vṛndāvana, even if he goes there. Actually going to Vṛndāvana involves taking shelter of the six Gosvāmīs by reading the *Bhaktirasāmṛta-sindhu, Vidagdha-mādhava, Lalita-mādhava* and the other books that they have given. In this way one can understand the transcendental loving affairs between Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa. *Kabe hāma bujhaba se yugala-pirīti.* The conjugal love between Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa is not an ordinary human affair; it is fully transcendental. In order to understand Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa, worship Them and engage in Their loving service, one must be guided by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Nityānanda Prabhu and the six Gosvāmīs, Lord Caitanya’s direct disciples.

For an ordinary man, worship of Śrī Caitanya and Nityānanda Prabhu or the Pañca-tattva is easier than worship of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa. Unless one is very fortunate, he should not be induced to worship Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa directly. A neophyte student who is not sufficiently educated or enlightened should not indulge in the worship of Śrī Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa or the chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra.* Even if he does so, he cannot get the desired result. One should therefore chant the names of Nitāi-Gaura and worship Them without false prestige. Since everyone within this material world is more or less influenced by sinful activities, in the beginning it is essential that one take to the worship of Guru-Gaurāṅga and ask their favor, for thus despite all his disqualifications one will very soon become qualified to worship the Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa *vigraha.*

It should be noted in this connection that the holy names of Lord Kṛṣṇa and Gaurasundara are both identical with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore one should not consider one name to be more potent than the other. Considering the position of the people of this age, however, the chanting of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s name is more essential than the chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra* because Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is the most magnanimous incarnation and His mercy is very easily achieved. Therefore one must first take shelter of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu by chanting *śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya prabhu-nityānanda śrī-advaita gadādhara śrīvāsādi-gaura-bhakta-vṛnda.* By serving Gaura-Nityānanda one is freed from the entanglements of material existence and thus becomes qualified to worship the Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa Deity.

### Translation

**Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, the independent Supreme Personality of Godhead, is greatly magnanimous. Unless one worships Him, one can never be liberated.**

### Purport

Śrī Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura here remarks that one should not give up the worship of Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa to worship Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. By worshiping either Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa or Lord Caitanya alone, one cannot become advanced. One should not try to supersede the instructions of the six Gosvāmīs, for they are *ācāryas* and very dear to Lord Caitanya. Therefore Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura sings:

*rūpa-raghunātha-pade haibe ākuti  
kabe hāma bujhaba se yugala-pirīti*

One must be a submissive student of the six Gosvāmīs, from Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī to Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī. Not following their instructions but imagining how to worship Gaurasundara and Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa is a great offense, as a result of which one clears a path to hell. If one neglects the instructions of the six Gosvāmīs and yet becomes a so-called devotee of Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa, he merely criticizes the real devotees of Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa. As a result of speculation, he considers Gaurasundara to be an ordinary devotee and therefore cannot make progress in serving the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa.

### Purport

Śrī Vṛndāvana dāsa Ṭhākura’s *Śrī Caitanya-bhāgavata* was originally entitled *Śrī Caitanya-maṅgala,* but when Śrīla Locana dāsa Ṭhākura later wrote another book named *Śrī Caitanya-maṅgala,* Śrīla Vṛndāvana dāsa Ṭhākura changed the name of his own book, which is now therefore known as *Śrī Caitanya-bhāgavata.* The life of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is very elaborately described in the *Caitanya-bhāgavata,* and Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī has already informed us that in his *Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta* he has described whatever Vṛndāvana dāsa Ṭhākura has not mentioned. This acceptance of *Śrī Caitanya-bhāgavata* by Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī indicates his acceptance of the disciplic succession. A writer of transcendental literature never tries to surpass the previous *ācāryas.*

**By reading Śrī Caitanya-maṅgala one can understand all the glories and truths of Lord Caitanya and Nityānanda and come to the ultimate conclusion of devotional service to Lord Kṛṣṇa.**

### Purport

*Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* is the authoritative reference book from which to understand devotional service, but because it is very elaborate, few men can understand its purport. *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* is the original commentary on the *Vedānta-sūtra,* which is called *nyāya-prasthāna.* It was written to enable one to understand the Absolute Truth through infallible logic and argument, and therefore its natural commentary, *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,* is extremely elaborate. Professional reciters have created the impression that *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* deals only with Kṛṣṇa’s *rāsa-līlā,* although Kṛṣṇa’s *rāsa-līlā* is described only in chapters 29 through 33 of the Tenth Canto. They have in this way presented Kṛṣṇa to the Western world as a great woman-hunter, and therefore we sometimes have to deal with such misconceptions in preaching. Another difficulty in understanding *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* is that the professional reciters have introduced *bhāgavata-saptāha,* or seven-day readings of the *Bhāgavatam.* They want to finish *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* in a week, although it is so sublime that even one verse of *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,* if properly explained, cannot be completed in three months. Under these circumstances, it is a great aid for the common man to read Śrīla Vṛndāvana dāsa Ṭhākura’s *Caitanya-bhāgavata,* for thus he can actually understand devotional service, Kṛṣṇa, Lord Caitanya and Nityānanda. Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī has said:

*śruti-smṛti-purāṇādi-* *pañcarātra-vidhiṁ vinā  
aikāntikī harer bhaktir* *utpātāyaiva kalpate*

“Devotional service to the Lord that ignores the authorized Vedic literatures — the *Upaniṣads, Purāṇas, Nārada-pañcarātra,* etc. — is simply an unnecessary disturbance in society.” Due to misunderstanding *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,* people are misled regarding the science of Kṛṣṇa. However, by reading Śrīla Vṛndāvana dāsa Ṭhākura’s book one can very easily understand this science.

### Purport

Śrīla Sanātana Gosvāmī has written in his *Hari-bhakti-vilāsa:*

*avaiṣṇava-mukhodgīrṇaṁ* *pūtaṁ hari-kathāmṛtam  
śravaṇaṁ naiva kartavyaṁ* *sarpocchiṣṭaṁ yathā payaḥ*

“One should not hear anything about Kṛṣṇa from a non-Vaiṣṇava. Milk touched by the lips of a serpent has poisonous effects; similarly, talks about Kṛṣṇa given by a non-Vaiṣṇava are also poisonous.”

Transcendental literature that strictly follows the Vedic principles and the conclusion of the *Purāṇas* and *pāñcarātrika-vidhi* can be written only by a pure devotee. It is not possible for a common man to write books on *bhakti,* for his writings will not be effective. He may be a very great scholar and may be expert in presenting literature in flowery language, but this is not at all helpful in understanding transcendental literature. Even if transcendental literature is written in faulty language, it is acceptable if it is written by a devotee, whereas so-called transcendental literature written by a mundane scholar, even if it is a very highly polished literary presentation, cannot be accepted. The secret in a devotee’s writing is that when he writes about the pastimes of the Lord, the Lord helps him; he does not write alone. As stated in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (10.10), *dadāmi buddhi-yogaṁ taṁ yena mām upayānti te.* Since a devotee writes in service to the Lord, the Lord from within gives him so much intelligence that he sits down near the Lord and goes on writing books. Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī confirms that what Vṛndāvana dāsa Ṭhākura wrote was actually spoken by Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and he simply repeated it. The same holds true for *Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta.* Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī wrote *Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta* in his old age, in an invalid condition, but it is such a sublime literature that Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Gosvāmī Mahārāja used to say, “The time will come when the people of the world will learn Bengali to read *Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta.*” We are trying to present *Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta* in English and do not know how successful it will be, but if one reads the original *Caitanya-caritāmṛta* in Bengali he will relish increasing ecstasy in devotional service.

### Translation

**Nārāyaṇī eternally eats the remnants of the food of Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Śrīla Vṛndāvana dāsa Ṭhākura was born of her womb.**

### Purport

In text 43 of the *Gaura-gaṇoddeśa-dīpikā,* a book written by Kavi-karṇapūra that describes all the associates of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and who they previously were, there is the following statement regarding Nārāyaṇī:

*ambikāyāḥ svasā yāsīn* *nāmnā śrīla-kilimbikā  
kṛṣṇocchiṣṭaṁ prabhuñjānā* *seyaṁ nārāyaṇī matā*

When Lord Kṛṣṇa was a child, He was nursed by a woman named Ambikā, who had a younger sister named Kilimbikā. During the time of Lord Caitanya’s incarnation, the same Kilimbikā used to eat the remnants of food left by Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. That Kilimbikā was Nārāyaṇī, who was a niece of Śrīvāsa Ṭhākura’s. Later on, when she grew up and married, Śrīla Vṛndāvana dāsa Ṭhākura was born from her womb. A devotee of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa is celebrated in terms of devotional service rendered to the Lord; thus we know Śrīla Vṛndāvana dāsa Ṭhākura as the son of Nārāyaṇī. Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura notes in this connection that there is no reference to his paternal ancestry because there is no need to understand it.

Among these, fifty are primary (*ayaṁ netā su-ramyāṅgaḥ,* etc.), and in minute quantity they were all present in the body of Śrī Haridāsa Paṇḍita. Since every living entity is a part of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, all fifty of these good qualities of Śrī Kṛṣṇa are originally minutely present in every living being. Due to his contact with material nature, these qualities are not visible in the conditioned soul, but when one becomes a purified devotee, they all automatically manifest themselves. This is stated in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (5.18.12), as mentioned in the text below.

### Purport

Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura writes in his *Anubhāṣya,* “Śrī Ananta Ācārya is one of the eternal associates of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Previously, during the advent of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, Ananta Ācārya was Sudevī, one of the eight *gopīs.* This is stated in the *Gaura-gaṇoddeśa-dīpikā* (165), as follows: *anantācārya-gosvāmī yā su-devī purā vraje.* ‘Ananta Ācārya Gosvāmī was formerly Sudevī-gopī in Vraja \[Vṛndāvana\].’ In Jagannātha Purī, or Puruṣottama-kṣetra, there is a monastery known as Gaṅgā-mātā Maṭha that was established by Ananta Ācārya. In the disciplic succession of the Gaṅgā-mātā Maṭha, he is known as Vinoda-mañjarī. One of his disciples was Haridāsa Paṇḍita Gosvāmī, who is also known as Śrī Raghu Gopāla and as Śrī Rāsa-mañjarī. His disciple Lakṣmīpriyā was the maternal aunt of Gaṅgā-mātā, a princess who was the daughter of the King of Puṭiyā. Gaṅgā-mātā brought a Deity of the name Śrī Rasika-rāya from Kṛṣṇa Miśra of Jaipur and installed Him in the house of Sārvabhauma in Jagannātha Purī. The disciple in the fifth generation after Śrī Ananta Ācārya was Śrī Vanamālī; in the sixth generation, Śrī Bhagavān dāsa, who was a Bengali; in the seventh generation, Madhusūdana dāsa, who was an Oriyā; in the eighth generation, Nīlāmbara dāsa; in the ninth generation, Śrī Narottama dāsa; in the tenth generation, Pītāmbara dāsa; and in the eleventh generation, Śrī Mādhava dāsa. The disciple in the twelfth generation is presently in charge of the Gaṅgā-mātā monastery.”

It is a qualification of a Vaiṣṇava that he is *adoṣa-darśī:* he never sees others’ faults. Of course, every human being has both good qualities and faults. Therefore it is said, *saj-janā guṇam icchanti doṣam icchanti pāmarāḥ:* everyone has a combination of faults and glories. But a Vaiṣṇava, a sober man, accepts only a man’s glories and not his faults, for flies seek sores whereas honeybees seek honey. Haridāsa Paṇḍita never found fault with a Vaiṣṇava but considered only his good qualities.

### Translation

**Govinda Gosāñi, the priest engaged in the service of Lord Govinda in Vṛndāvana, was a disciple of Kāśīśvara Gosāñi. There was no servant more dear to the Govinda Deity.**

### Purport

Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura writes in his *Anubhāṣya,* “Kāśīśvara Gosāñi was one of the contemporaries of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu who was with the Lord in Jagannātha Purī. Also known as Kāśīśvara Paṇḍita, he was a disciple of Īśvara Purī and son of Vāsudeva Bhaṭṭācārya, who belonged to the dynasty of Kāñjilāla Kānu. His surname was Caudhurī. His nephew, his sister’s son, who was named Rudra Paṇḍita, was the original priest of Vallabhapura, which is situated about one mile from the Śrīrāmapura railway station in the village of Cātarā. Installed there are the Deities of Rādhā-Govinda and Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Kāśīśvara Gosāñi was a very strong man, and therefore when Lord Caitanya visited the temple of Jagannātha, he used to protect the Lord from the crowds. Another of his duties was to distribute *prasādam* to the devotees after *kīrtana.*”

Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura visited this temple at Vallabhapura. At that time the person in charge was a Śaivite, Śrī Śivacandra Caudhurī, who was a descendant of Kāśīśvara Gosāñi’s brother. In Vallabhapura there was a permanent arrangement to cook nine kilos of rice, vegetables and other foodstuffs daily, and near the village there is sufficient land, which belonged to the Deity, on which this rice was grown. Unfortunately, the descendants of Kāśīśvara Gosāñi’s brother have sold a major portion of this land, and therefore the Deity worship has now been hampered.

It is said in the *Gaura-gaṇoddeśa-dīpikā* (137) that the servant of Kṛṣṇa in Vṛndāvana named Bhṛṅgāra descended as Kāśīśvara Gosāñi during the pastimes of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. In our householder life we also sometimes visited this temple of Vallabhapura and took *prasādam* there at noon. The Deities of this temple, Śrī Śrī Rādhā-Govinda and the Gaurāṅga *vigraha,* are extremely beautiful. Near Vallabhapura is a beautiful temple of Jagannātha. We sometimes used to take *prasādam* in this Jagannātha temple also. These two temples are situated within a one mile-radius of the Śrīrāmapura railway station, near Calcutta.

**By their mercy, all these devotees ordered me to write of the last pastimes of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Because of their order only, although I am shameless, I have attempted to write this Caitanya-caritāmṛta.**

### Purport

To write about the transcendental pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is not an ordinary endeavor. Unless one is empowered by the higher authorities, or advanced devotees, one cannot write transcendental literature, for all such literature must be above suspicion, or, in other words, it must have none of the defects of conditioned souls, namely mistakes, illusions, cheating and imperfect sense perceptions. The words of Kṛṣṇa and of the disciplic succession that carries the orders of Kṛṣṇa are actually authoritative. To be empowered to write transcendental literature is a privilege in which a writer can take great pride. As a humble Vaiṣṇava, Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī, being thus empowered, felt very much ashamed that it was he who was to narrate the pastimes of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

*vaiṣṇavera ājñā pāñā cintita-antare  
madana-gopāle gelāṅ ājñā māgibāre*

### Synonyms

*vaiṣṇavera* — of all the Vaiṣṇava devotees; *ājñā* — order; *pāñā* — receiving; *cintita*-*antare* — anxiety within myself; *madana*-*gopāle* — to the temple of Śrī Madana-mohana; *gelāṅ* — I went; *ājñā* — order; *māgibāre* — to receive.

### Translation

**Having received the order of the Vaiṣṇavas but being anxious within my heart, I went to the temple of Madana-mohana in Vṛndāvana to ask His permission also.**

### Purport

A Vaiṣṇava always follows the order of *guru* and Kṛṣṇa. *Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta* was written by Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī by their mercy. Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī considered all the devotees that have been mentioned to be his preceptor *gurus,* or spiritual masters, and Madana-gopāla (Śrī Madana-mohana *vigraha*) is Kṛṣṇa Himself. Thus he took permission from both of them, and when he received the mercy of both *guru* and Kṛṣṇa, he was able to write this great literature, *Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta.* This example should be followed. Anyone who attempts to write about Kṛṣṇa must first take permission from the spiritual master and Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa is situated in everyone’s heart, and the spiritual master is His direct external representative. Thus Kṛṣṇa is situated *antar-bahiḥ,* within and without. One must first become a pure devotee by following the strict regulative principles and chanting sixteen rounds daily, and when one thinks that he is actually on the Vaiṣṇava platform, he must then take permission from the spiritual master, and that permission must also be confirmed by Kṛṣṇa from within his heart. Then, if one is very sincere and pure, he can write transcendental literature, either prose or poetry.

āmāra likhana yena śukera paṭhana*

### Synonyms

*ei* — this; *grantha* — great literature; *lekhāya* — causes me to write; *more* — unto me; *madana*-*mohana* — the Deity; *āmāra* — my; *likhana* — writing; *yena* — like; *śukera* — of the parrot; *paṭhana* — responding.

### Translation

**Actually Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta is not my writing but the dictation of Śrī Madana-mohana. My writing is like the repetition of a parrot.**

### Purport

This should be the attitude of all devotees. When the Supreme Personality of Godhead recognizes a devotee, He gives him intelligence and dictates how he may go back home, back to Godhead. This is confirmed in *Śrīmad Bhagavad-gītā* (10.10):

*teṣāṁ satata-yuktānāṁ* *bhajatāṁ prīti-pūrvakam  
dadāmi buddhi-yogaṁ taṁ* *yena mām upayānti te*

“To those who are constantly devoted to serving Me with love, I give the understanding by which they can come to Me.” The opportunity to engage in the transcendental loving service of the Lord is open to everyone because every living entity is constitutionally a servant of the Lord. To engage in the service of the Lord is the natural function of the living entity, but because he is covered by the influence of *mayā,* the material energy, he thinks it to be a very difficult task. But if he places himself under the guidance of a spiritual master and does everything sincerely, immediately the Lord, who is situated within everyone’s heart, dictates how to serve Him (*dadāmi buddhi-yogaṁ tam*)*.* The Lord gives this direction, and thus the devotee’s life becomes perfect. Whatever a pure devotee does is done by the dictation of the Supreme Lord. Thus it is confirmed by the author of *Śrī* *Caitanya-caritāmṛta* that whatever he wrote was written under the direction of the Śrī Madana-mohana Deity.

### Translation

**As a wooden doll is made to dance by a magician, I write as Madana-gopāla orders me to do so.**

### Purport

This is the position of a pure devotee. One should not take any responsibility on his own but should be a soul surrendered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who will then give him dictation as the *caittya-guru,* or the spiritual master within. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is pleased to guide a devotee from within and without. From within He guides him as the Supersoul, and from without He guides him as the spiritual master.
