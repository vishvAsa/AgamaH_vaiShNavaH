title = "21 The Pastimes of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu in His Youth"
+++
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN

The seventeenth chapter, as summarized by Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura in his *Amṛta-pravāha-bhāṣya,* describes Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s pastimes from His sixteenth year until the time He accepted the renounced order of life. Śrīla Vṛndāvana dāsa Ṭhākura has already vividly described these pastimes in the *Caitanya-bhāgavata;* therefore Kṛṣṇa dāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī describes them only briefly. Vivid descriptions of some portions of His pastimes are seen in this chapter, however, because Vṛndāvana dāsa Ṭhākura has not elaborately described them.

In this chapter we shall find descriptions of the mango distribution festival and Lord Caitanya’s discourses with Chand Kazi. Finally, the chapter shows that the same son of mother Yaśodā, Lord Kṛṣṇa, tasted four transcendental mellows of devotional service in His form of Śacīnandana, the son of mother Śacī. To understand Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī’s ecstatic love for Him, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa assumed the form of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. The attitude of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī is considered the superexcellent devotional mentality. As Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Kṛṣṇa Himself assumed the position of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī to taste Her ecstatic situation. No one else could do this.

When Śrī Kṛṣṇa assumed the form of the four-armed Nārāyaṇa, the *gopīs* showed their respect, but they were not very interested in Him. In the ecstatic love of the *gopīs,* all worshipable forms but Kṛṣṇa are rejected. Among all the *gopīs,* Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī has the highest ecstatic love. When Kṛṣṇa in His form of Nārāyaṇa saw Rādhārāṇī, He could not keep His position as Nārāyaṇa and again assumed the form of Kṛṣṇa.

The King of Vrajabhūmi is Nanda Mahārāja, and the same person in Navadvīpa is Jagannātha Miśra, the father of Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Similarly, mother Yaśodā is the Queen of Vrajabhūmi, and in the pastimes of Lord Caitanya she is Śacīmātā. Therefore the son of Śacī is the son of Yaśodā. Śrī Nityānanda occupies an ecstatic position of parental love in servitude and fraternal attraction. Śrī Advaita Prabhu exhibits the ecstasy of both fraternity and servitude. All the Lord’s other associates, situated in their original love, engage in the service of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

The same Absolute Truth who enjoys as Kṛṣṇa, Śyāmasundara, who plays His flute and dances with the *gopīs,* sometimes takes birth in a *brāhmaṇa* family and plays the part of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, accepting the renounced order of life. It appears contradictory that the same Kṛṣṇa accepted the ecstasy of the *gopīs,* and of course this is very difficult for an ordinary person to understand. But if we accept the inconceivable energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, we can understand that everything is possible. There is no need of mundane arguments in this connection, because mundane arguments are meaningless in regard to inconceivable potency.

At the end of the seventeenth chapter, Śrīla Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī, following in the footsteps of Śrīla Vyāsadeva, has summarized all the *ādi-līlā* pastimes separately.

वन्दे स्वैराद्भुतेहं तं चैतन्यं यत्प्रसादतः ।  
यवनाः सुमनाय़न्ते कृष्णनामप्रजल्पकाः ॥ १ ॥

### Verse text

*vande svairādbhutehaṁ taṁ  
caitanyaṁ yat-prasādataḥ  
yavanāḥ sumanāyante  
kṛṣṇa-nāma-prajalpakāḥ*

### Synonyms

*vande* — let me offer my obeisances; *svaira* — completely independent; *adbhuta* — and uncommon; *īham* — whose activities; *tam* — unto Him; *caitanyam* — Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu; *yat* — of whom; *prasādataḥ* — by the mercy; *yavanāḥ* — even the unclean; *sumanāyante* — are transformed into gentlemen; *kṛṣṇa*-*nāma* — of the holy name of Lord Kṛṣṇa; *prajalpakāḥ* — taking to the chanting.

### Translation

**Let me offer my respectful obeisances to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, by whose mercy even unclean yavanas become perfectly well bred gentlemen by chanting the holy name of the Lord. Such is the power of Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.**

### Purport

There is a persistent misunderstanding between caste *brāhmaṇas* and advanced Vaiṣṇavas, or *gosvāmīs,* because caste *brāhmaṇas,* or *smārtas,* are of the opinion that one cannot become a *brāhmaṇa* unless he changes his body. As we have discussed several times, it is to be understood that by the supremely powerful potency of the Lord, as described by Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī, everything is possible. Caitanya Mahāprabhu is as fully independent as Kṛṣṇa. Therefore no one can interfere with His activities. If He wants, by His mercy He can convert even a *yavana,* an unclean follower of non-Vedic principles, into a perfectly well behaved gentleman. This is actually happening in our propagation of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. The members of the present Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement were not born in India, nor do they belong to the Vedic culture, but within the short time of four or five years they have become such wonderful devotees simply by chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra* that even in India they are well received as perfectly well behaved Vaiṣṇavas wherever they go.

Although less intelligent men cannot understand it, this is the special power of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Actually, the body of a Kṛṣṇa conscious person changes in many ways. Even in the United States, when our devotees chant on the street, American ladies and gentlemen inquire from them whether they are actually Americans because no one could expect Americans to become such nice devotees all of a sudden. Even Christian priests are greatly surprised that all these boys from Jewish and Christian families have joined this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement; before joining, they never regarded any principles of religion seriously, but now they have become sincere devotees of the Lord. Everywhere people express this astonishment, and we take great pride in the transcendental behavior of our students. Such wonders are possible, however, only by the mercy of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. They are not ordinary or mundane.

### Bengali

वाय़ुव्याधिच्छले कैल प्रेम परकाश ।  
भक्तगण लञा कैल विविध विलास ॥ ७ ॥

### Verse text

*vāyu-vyādhi-cchale kaila prema parakāśa  
bhakta-gaṇa lañā kaila vividha vilāsa*

### Synonyms

*vāyu*-*vyādhi* — disease caused by disturbance of the air in the body; *chale* — on the plea of; *kaila* — made; *prema* — love of Godhead; *parakāśa* — manifestation; *bhakta*-*gaṇa* — the devotees; *lañā* — taking with Him; *kaila* — did; *vividha* — varieties of; *vilāsa* — pastimes.

### Translation

**In His youth the Lord exhibited His ecstatic love of Kṛṣṇa on the plea of disturbances of the bodily airs. Accompanied by His confidential devotees, He enjoyed various pastimes in this way.**

### Purport

According to Āyur-vedic treatment, the entire physiological system is conducted by three elements, namely *vāyu, pitta* and *kapha* (air, bile and mucus). Secretions within the body transform into other secretions like blood, urine and stool, but if there are disturbances in the metabolism, the secretions turn into *kapha* (mucus) by the influence of the air within the body. According to the Āyur-vedic system, when the secretion of bile and formation of mucus disturb the air circulating within the body, fifty-nine varieties of diseases may occur. One such disease is craziness.

On the plea of disturbance of the bodily air and metabolism, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu acted as if crazy. Thus in His school He began to explain the grammar of verbs through Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Explaining everything in grammar in relationship to Kṛṣṇa, the Lord induced His students to refrain from worldly education, for it is better to become Kṛṣṇa conscious and in this way attain the highest perfectional platform of education. On these grounds, Śrī Jīva Gosvāmī later compiled the grammar entitled *Hari-nāmāmṛta-vyākaraṇa.* People in general consider such explanations crazy. Therefore the Lord’s purpose in His attitude of craziness was to explain that there is nothing within our experience but Kṛṣṇa consciousness, for everything may be dovetailed with Kṛṣṇa consciousness. These pastimes of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu have been very vividly described in the *Caitanya-bhāgavata, Madhya-līlā,* chapter one.

तवेत करिला प्रभु गय़ाते गमन ।

### Verse text

*tabeta karilā prabhu gayāte gamana  
īśvara-purīra saṅge tathāi milana*

### Synonyms

*tabeta* — thereafter; *karilā* — did; *prabhu* — Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu; *gayāte* — to Gayā; *gamana* — travel; *īśvara*-*purīra* *saṅge* — with Īśvara Purī; *tathāi* — there; *milana* — meeting.

### Translation

**Thereafter the Lord went to Gayā. There He met Śrīla Īśvara Purī.**

### Purport

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu went to Gayā to offer respectful oblations to His forefathers. This process is called *piṇḍa-dāna.* In Vedic society, after the death of a relative, especially one’s father or mother, one must go to Gayā and there offer oblations to the lotus feet of Lord Viṣṇu. Therefore hundreds and thousands of men gather in Gayā daily to offer such oblations, or *śrāddha.* Following this principle, Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu also went there to offer *piṇḍa* to His dead father. Fortunately He met Īśvara Purī there.

दीक्षा–अनन्तरे हैल, प्रेमेर प्रकाश ।  
देशे आगमन पुनः प्रेमेर विलास ॥ ९ ॥

### Verse text

*dīkṣā-anantare haila, premera prakāśa  
deśe āgamana punaḥ premera vilāsa*

### Synonyms

*dīkṣā* — initiation; *anantare* — immediately after; *haila* — became; *premera* — of love of Godhead; *prakāśa* — exhibition; *deśe* — in His home country; *āgamana* — coming back; *punaḥ* — again; *premera* — of love of God; *vilāsa* — enjoyment.

### Translation

**In Gayā, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was initiated by Īśvara Purī, and immediately afterwards He exhibited signs of love of Godhead. He again displayed such symptoms after returning home.**

### Purport

When Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu went to Gayā, accompanied by many of His disciples, He became sick on the way. He had such a high fever that He asked His students to bring water that had washed the feet of *brāhmaṇas,* and when they brought it the Lord drank it and was cured. Therefore everyone should respect the position of a *brāhmaṇa,* as indicated by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Neither the Lord nor His followers displayed any disrespect to *brāhmaṇas.*

The followers of the Lord must be prepared to offer *brāhmaṇas* all due respect. But preachers of Lord Caitanya’s cult object if someone presents himself as a *brāhmaṇa* without having the necessary qualifications. The followers of Lord Caitanya cannot blindly accept that everyone born in a *brāhmaṇa* family is a *brāhmaṇa.* Therefore one should not indiscriminately follow the Lord’s example of showing respect to *brāhmaṇas* by drinking water that has washed their feet. Gradually the *brāhmaṇa* families have become degraded because of the contamination of Kali-yuga. Thus they misguide people by exploiting their sentiments.

शचीके प्रेमदान, तवे अद्वैत–मिलन ।  
अद्वैत पाइल विश्वरूप–दरशन ॥ १० ॥

### Verse text

*śacīke prema-dāna, tabe advaita-milana  
advaita pāila viśvarūpa-daraśana*

### Synonyms

*śacīke* — unto mother Śacīdevī; *prema*-*dāna* — giving love of Godhead; *tabe* — thereafter; *advaita* — with Advaita Ācārya; *milana* — meeting; *advaita* — Advaita Ācārya; *pāila* — received; *viśva*-*rūpa* — of the universal form of the Lord; *daraśana* — vision.

### Translation

**Thereafter the Lord delivered love of Kṛṣṇa to His mother, Śacīdevī, nullifying her offense at the feet of Advaita Ācārya. Thus there was a meeting with Advaita Ācārya, who later had a vision of the Lord’s universal form.**

### Purport

One day Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was sitting on the throne of Viṣṇu in the house of Śrīvāsa Prabhu, and in a mood of His own He said, “My mother has offended the lotus feet of Advaita Ācārya. Unless she nullifies this offense at the lotus feet of a Vaiṣṇava, it will not be possible for her to achieve love of Kṛṣṇa.” Hearing this, all the devotees went to bring Advaita Ācārya there. While coming to see the Lord, Advaita Ācārya was glorifying the characteristics of mother Śacīdevī, and thus upon arriving He fell down on the ground in ecstasy. Then, under the instruction of Lord Caitanya, Śacīdevī took advantage of this situation to touch Advaita Ācārya’s lotus feet. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was very much pleased by His mother’s action, and He said, “Now My mother’s offense at the lotus feet of Advaita Ācārya has been rectified, and she may have love of Kṛṣṇa without difficulty.” By this example Lord Caitanya taught everyone that although one may be very much advanced in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, if one offends the lotus feet of a Vaiṣṇava his advancement will not bear fruit. We should therefore be very cautious not to offend a Vaiṣṇava. *Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta* has described such an offense as follows:

*yadi vaiṣṇava-aparādha uṭhe hātī mātā  
upāḍe vā chiṇḍe, tāra śukhi’ yāya pātā*

(Cc. *Madhya* 19.156)

As a mad elephant may trample all the plants in a garden, so by committing one offense at the lotus feet of a Vaiṣṇava one may spoil all the devotional service he has accumulated in his life.

After this incident, one day Advaita Ācārya Prabhu requested Caitanya Mahāprabhu to display the universal form He had very kindly shown Arjuna. Lord Caitanya agreed to this proposal, and Advaita Prabhu was fortunate enough to see the universal form of the Lord.

### Purport

*Abhiṣeka* is a special function for the installation of the Deity. In this ceremony the Deity is bathed with milk and water and then worshiped and given a change of dress. This *abhiṣeka* function was especially observed at the house of Śrīvāsa. All the devotees, according to their means, worshiped the Lord with all kinds of paraphernalia, and the Lord gave benedictions to each devotee according to his desire.

तवे नित्यानन्द–स्वरूपेर आगमन ।

### Verse text

*tabe nityānanda-svarūpera āgamana  
prabhuke miliyā pāila ṣaḍ-bhuja-darśana*

### Synonyms

*tabe* — thereafter; *nityānanda*-*svarūpera* — of the Personality of Godhead Nityānanda; *āgamana* — appearance; *prabhuke* — Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu; *miliyā* — meeting; *pāila* — obtained; *ṣaṭ*-*bhuja*-*darśana* — a vision of the six-armed Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

### Translation

**After this function at the house of Śrīvāsa Ṭhākura, Nityānanda Prabhu appeared, and when He met with Lord Caitanya He got the opportunity to see Him in His six-armed form.**

### Purport

The form of Ṣaḍ-bhuja, the six-armed Lord Gaurasundara, is a representation of three incarnations. The form of Śrī Rāmacandra is symbolized by a bow in one hand and an arrow in another, the form of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa is symbolized by a stick and a flute like those generally held by a cowherd boy, and Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu is symbolized by a *sannyāsa-daṇḍa* and a *kamaṇḍalu,* or waterpot.

Śrīla Nityānanda Prabhu was born in the village of Ekacakrā, in the district of Birbhum, as the son of Padmāvatī and Hāḍāi Paṇḍita. In His childhood He played like Balarāma. When He was growing up, a *sannyāsī* came to the house of Hāḍāi Paṇḍita and begged to have the *paṇḍita’s* son as his *brahmacārī* assistant. Hāḍāi Paṇḍita immediately agreed and delivered his son to him, although the separation was greatly shocking, so much so that Hāḍāi lost his life after the separation. Nityānanda Prabhu traveled on many pilgrimages with the *sannyāsī.* It is said that for many days He lived at Mathurā with him, and at that time He heard about Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s pastimes in Navadvīpa. Therefore He came down to Bengal to see the Lord. When Lord Nityānanda came to Navadvīpa, He was a guest at the house of Nandana Ācārya. Understanding that Nityānanda Prabhu had arrived, Lord Caitanya sent His devotees to Him, and thus there was a meeting between Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and Nityānanda Prabhu.

### Verse text

*tabe nityānanda-gosāñira vyāsa-pūjana

### Synonyms

*tabe* — thereafter; *nityānanda* — Nityānanda; *gosāñira* — of the Lord; *vyāsa*-*pūjana* — worshiping Vyāsadeva or the spiritual master; *nityānanda*-*āveśe* — in the ecstasy of becoming Nityānanda; *kaila* — did; *muṣala* *dhāraṇa* — carrying a plowlike weapon called a *muṣala*.

### Translation

**Nityānanda Prabhu then arranged to offer Vyāsa-pūjā, or worship of the spiritual master, to Lord Śrī Gaurasundara. But Lord Caitanya carried the plowlike weapon called muṣala in the ecstasy of being Nityānanda Prabhu.**

### Purport

By the order of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Nityānanda Prabhu arranged for the Vyāsa-pūjā of the Lord on the night of the full moon. He arranged for the Vyāsa-pūjā, or *guru-pūjā,* through the agency of Vyāsadeva. Since Vyāsadeva is the original *guru* (spiritual master) of all who follow the Vedic principles, worship of the spiritual master is called Vyāsa-pūjā. Nityānanda Prabhu arranged for the Vyāsa-pūjā, and *saṅkīrtana* was going on, but when He tried to put a garland on the shoulder of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, He saw Himself in Lord Caitanya. There is no difference between the spiritual positions of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu and Nityānanda Prabhu, or Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma. All of Them are but different manifestations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. During this special ceremony, all the devotees of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu could understand that there is no difference between Lord Caitanya and Nityānanda Prabhu.

One night Śacīdevī dreamt that the Deities in her house, Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma, had taken the forms of Caitanya and Nityānanda and were fighting one another, as children do, to eat the *naivedya,* or offering to the Deities. The next day, by the will of Lord Caitanya, Śacīdevī invited Nityānanda to take *prasādam* at her house. Thus Viśvambhara (Lord Caitanya) and Nityānanda were eating together, and Śacīdevī realized that They were none other than Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma. Seeing this, she fainted.

Jagāi and Mādhāi were two brothers born in Navadvīpa in a respectable *brāhmaṇa* family who later became addicted to all kinds of sinful activities. By the order of Lord Caitanya, both Nityānanda Prabhu and Haridāsa Ṭhākura used to preach the cult of Kṛṣṇa consciousness door to door. In the course of such preaching they found Jagāi and Mādhāi, two maddened drunken brothers, who, upon seeing them, began to chase them. On the next day, Mādhāi struck Nityānanda Prabhu on the head with a piece of earthen pot, thus drawing blood. When Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu heard of this, He immediately came to the spot, ready to punish both brothers, but when the all-merciful Lord Gaurāṅga saw Jagāi’s repentant behavior, He immediately embraced him. By seeing the Supreme Personality of Godhead face to face and embracing Him, both the sinful brothers were at once cleansed. Thus they received initiation into the chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra* from the Lord and were delivered.

तवे सप्तप्रहर छिला प्रभु भावावेशे ।

### Verse text

*tabe sapta-prahara chilā prabhu bhāvāveśe  
yathā tathā bhakta-gaṇa dekhila viśeṣe*

### Synonyms

*tabe* — thereafter; *sapta*-*prahara* — twenty-one hours; *chilā* — remained; *prabhu* — the Lord; *bhāva*-*āveśe* — in ecstasy; *yathā* — anywhere; *tathā* — everywhere; *bhakta*-*gaṇa* — the devotees; *dekhila* — saw; *viśeṣe* — specifically.

### Translation

**After this incident, the Lord remained in an ecstatic position for twenty-one hours, and all the devotees saw His specific pastimes.**

### Purport

In the Deity’s room there must be a bed for the Deity behind His throne. (This system should immediately be introduced in all our centers. It does not matter whether the bed is big or small; it should be of a size the Deity room can conveniently accommodate, but there must be at least a small bed.) One day in the house of Śrīvāsa Ṭhākura, Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu sat down on the bed of Viṣṇu, and all the devotees worshiped Him with the Vedic *mantras* of the *Puruṣa-sūkta,* beginning with *sahasra-śīrṣā puruṣaḥ sahasrākṣaḥ sahasra-pāt.* This *veda-stuti* should also be introduced, if possible, for installations of Deities. While bathing the Deity, all the priests and devotees must chant this *Puruṣa-sūkta* and offer the appropriate paraphernalia for worshiping the Deity, such as flowers, fruits, incense, *ārati* paraphernalia, *naivedya, vastra* and ornaments. All the devotees worshiped Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu in this way, and the Lord remained in ecstasy for seven *praharas,* or twenty-one hours. He took this opportunity to show the devotees that He is the original Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, who is the source of all other incarnations, as confirmed in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (10.8): *ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavo mattaḥ sarvaṁ pravartate.* All the different forms of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, or *viṣṇu-tattva,* emanate from the body of Lord Kṛṣṇa. Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu exposed all the private desires of the devotees, and thus all of them became fully confident that Lord Caitanya is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

Some devotees call this exhibition of ecstasy by the Lord *sāta-prahariyā bhāva,* or “the ecstasy of twenty-one hours,” and others call it *mahābhāva-prakāśa* or *mahā-prakāśa.* There is a description of this *sāta-prahariyā bhāva* in the *Caitanya-bhāgavata, Madhya-khaṇḍa,* chapter nine, which mentions that Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu blessed a maidservant named Duḥkhī with the name Sukhī. He called for Kholāvecā Śrīdhara and showed him His *mahā-prakāśa.* Then He called for Murāri Gupta and showed him His feature as Lord Rāmacandra. He offered His blessings to Haridāsa Ṭhākura, and at this time He also asked Advaita Prabhu to explain the *Bhagavad-gītā* as it is (*gītāra satya-pāṭha*) and showed special favor to Mukunda.

### Translation

**One day Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu felt the ecstasy of the boar incarnation and got up on the shoulders of Murāri Gupta. Thus they both danced in Murāri Gupta’s courtyard.**

### Purport

One day Caitanya Mahāprabhu began to cry out, “Śūkara! Śūkara!” Thus crying out for the boar incarnation of the Lord, He assumed His form as the boar incarnation and got up on the shoulders of Murāri Gupta. He carried a small *gāḍu,* a small waterpot with a nozzle, and thus He symbolically picked up the earth from the depths of the ocean, for this is the pastime of Lord Varāha.

### Translation

**After this incident the Lord ate raw rice given by Śuklāmbara Brahmacārī and explained very elaborately the import of the “harer nāma” śloka mentioned in the Bṛhan-nāradīya Purāṇa.**

### Purport

Śuklāmbara Brahmacārī resided in Navadvīpa on the bank of the Ganges. When Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was dancing in ecstasy, he approached the Lord with a begging bag containing rice. The Lord was so pleased with His devotee that He immediately snatched the bag and began to eat the raw rice. No one forbade Him, and thus He finished the entire supply of rice.

### Translation

**“This verse repeats the word ‘eva’ \[‘certainly’\] three times for emphasis, and it also three times repeats ‘harer nāma’ \[‘the holy name of the Lord’\], just to make common people understand.**

### Purport

To emphasize something to an ordinary person, one may repeat it three times, just as one might say, “You must do this! You must do this! You must do this!” Thus the *Bṛhan-nāradīya Purāṇa* repeatedly emphasizes the chanting of the holy name so that people may take it seriously and thus free themselves from the clutches of *māyā.* It is our practical experience in the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement all over the world that many millions of people are factually coming to the spiritual stage of life simply by chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra* regularly, according to the prescribed principles. Therefore our request to all our students is that they daily chant at least sixteen rounds of this *harer nāma mahā-mantra* offenselessly, following the regulative principles. Thus their success will be assured without a doubt.

### Translation

**“The use of the word ‘kevala’ \[‘only’\] prohibits all other processes, such as the cultivation of knowledge, practice of mystic yoga, or performance of austerities and fruitive activities.**

### Purport

Our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement stresses the chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra* only, whereas those who do not know the secret of success for this Age of Kali unnecessarily indulge in the cultivation of knowledge, the practice of mystic *yoga* or the performance of fruitive activities or useless austerities. They are simply wasting their time and misleading their followers. When we point this out very plainly to an audience, members of opposing groups become angry at us. But according to the injunctions of the *śāstras,* we cannot make compromises with these so-called *jñānīs, yogīs, karmīs* and *tapasvīs.* When they say they are as good as we are, we must say that only we are good and that they are not good. This is not our obstinacy; it is the injunction of the *śāstras.* We must not deviate from the injunctions of the *śāstras.* This is confirmed in the next verse of the *Caitanya-caritāmṛta.*

### Translation

**“For even if one cuts a tree, it never protests, and even if it is drying up and dying, it does not ask anyone for water.**

### Purport

This practice of forbearance (*taror iva sahiṣṇunā*) is very difficult, but when one actually engages in chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra,* the quality of forbearance automatically develops. A person advanced in spiritual consciousness through the chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra* need not practice to develop it separately, for a devotee develops all good qualities simply by chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra* regularly.

### Purport

The grass is specifically mentioned in this verse because everyone tramples upon it yet the grass never protests. This example indicates that a spiritual master or leader should not be proud of his position; being always humbler than an ordinary common man, he should go on preaching the cult of Caitanya Mahāprabhu by chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra.*

**Raising my hands, I declare, “Everyone please hear me! String this verse on the thread of the holy name and wear it on your neck for continuous remembrance.”**

### Purport

When chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra,* in the beginning one may commit many offenses, which are called *nāmābhāsa* and *nāma-aparādha.* In this stage there is no possibility of achieving perfect love of Kṛṣṇa by chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra.* Therefore one must chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra* according to the principles of the above verse, *tṛṇād api su-nīcena taror iva sahiṣṇunā.* One should note in this connection that chanting involves the activities of the upper and lower lips as well as the tongue. All three must be engaged in chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra.* The words “Hare Kṛṣṇa” should be very distinctly pronounced and heard. Sometimes one mechanically produces a hissing sound instead of chanting with the proper pronunciation with the help of the lips and tongue. Chanting is very simple, but one must practice it seriously. Therefore the author of *Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta,* Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī, advises everyone to keep this verse always strung about his neck.

### Translation

**One night while kīrtana was going on inside Śrīvāsa Ṭhākura’s house, a brāhmaṇa named Gopāla Cāpāla, the chief of the nonbelievers, who was talkative and very rough in his speech, placed all the paraphernalia for worshiping the goddess Durgā outside Śrīvāsa Ṭhākura’s door.**

### Purport

This *brāhmaṇa,* Gopāla Cāpāla, wanted to defame Śrīvāsa Ṭhākura by proving that he was actually a *śākta,* or a worshiper of Bhavānī, the goddess Durgā, but was externally posing as a Vaiṣṇava. In Bengal there is perpetual competition between the devotees of goddess Kālī and the devotees of Lord Kṛṣṇa. Generally Bengalis, especially those who are meat-eaters and drunkards, are very much attached to worshiping the goddesses Durgā, Kālī, Śītalā and Caṇḍī. Such devotees, who are known as *śāktas,* or worshipers of the *śakti-tattva,* are always envious of Vaiṣṇavas. Since Śrīvāsa Ṭhākura was a well-known and respected Vaiṣṇava in Navadvīpa, Gopāla Cāpāla wanted to reduce his prestige by bringing him down to the platform of the *śāktas.* Therefore outside Śrīvāsa Ṭhākura’s door he placed various paraphernalia for worshiping Bhavānī, the wife of Lord Śiva, such as a red flower, a plantain leaf, a pot of wine, and reddish sandalwood paste. In the morning, when Śrīvāsa Ṭhākura saw all this paraphernalia in front of his door, he called for the respectable gentlemen of the neighborhood and showed them that at night he was worshiping Bhavānī. Very sorry, these gentlemen called for a sweeper to cleanse the place and purify it by sprinkling water and cow dung there. This incident concerning Gopāla Cāpāla is not mentioned in the *Caitanya-bhāgavata.*

### Synonyms

*nitya* *rātre* — every night; *kari* — I do; *āmi* — I; *bhavānī*-*pūjana* — worship of Bhavānī, the wife of Lord Śiva; *āmāra* — my; *mahimā* — glories; *dekha* — you see; *brāhmaṇa*-*sat*-*jana* — all respectable *brāhmaṇas*.

### Translation

**“Gentlemen, every night I worship the goddess Bhavānī. Since the paraphernalia for the worship is present here, now all you respectable brāhmaṇas and members of the higher castes can understand my position.”**

### Purport

According to the Vedic system there are four castes — the *brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas, vaiśyas* and *śūdras* — and below them are the *pañcamas* (literally, “members of the fifth group”), who are lower than the *śūdras.* The higher castes — the *brāhmaṇas,* the *kṣatriyas* and even the *vaiśyas* — were known as *brāhmaṇa-saj-jana.* The *brāhmaṇas* especially were known as *saj-jana,* or respectable gentlemen who guided the entire society. If there were disputes in the village, people would approach these respectable *brāhmaṇas* to settle them. Now it is very difficult to find such *brāhmaṇas* and *saj-janas,* and thus every village and town is so disrupted that there is no peace and happiness anywhere. To revive a fully cultured civilization, the scientific division of society into *brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas, vaiśyas* and *śūdras* must be introduced all over the world. Unless some people are trained as *brāhmaṇas,* there cannot be peace in human society.

### Translation

**They called for a sweeper \[hāḍi\], who threw all the items of worship far away and cleansed the place by mopping it with a mixture of water and cow dung.**

### Purport

The men in Vedic society who engage in public sanitary activities like picking up stool and sweeping the street are called *hāḍis.* Sometimes they are untouchable, especially when engaged in their profession, yet such *hāḍis* also have the right to become devotees. This is established by *Śrī Bhagavad-gītā* (9.32), where the Lord declares:

*māṁ hi pārtha vyapāśritya* *ye ’pi syuḥ pāpa-yonayaḥ  
striyo vaiśyās tathā śūdrās* *te ’pi yānti parāṁ gatim*

“O son of Pṛthā, those who take shelter in Me, though they be of lower birth — women, *vaiśyas* \[merchants\], and *śūdras* \[workers\] — can attain the supreme destination.”

There are many untouchables of the lower caste in India, but according to Vaiṣṇava principles everyone is welcome to accept this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement on the spiritual platform of life and thus be freed from trouble. Neither equality nor fraternity is possible on the material platform.

When Lord Caitanya declares *tṛṇād api su-nīcena taror iva sahiṣṇunā,* He indicates that one must be above the material conception of life. When one thoroughly understands that he is not the material body but a spiritual soul, he is even humbler than a man of the lower castes, for he is spiritually elevated. Such humility, in which one thinks himself lower than the grass, is called *su-nīcatva,* and being more tolerant than a tree is called *sahiṣṇutva,* forbearance. Being situated in devotional service, not caring for the material conception of life, is called *amānitva,* indifference to material respect; yet a devotee thus situated is called *māna-da,* for he is prepared to give honor to others without hesitation.

Mahatma Gandhi started the *hari-jana* movement to purify the untouchables, but he was a failure because he thought that one could become a *hari-jana,* a personal associate of the Lord, through some kind of material adjustment. That is not possible. Unless one fully realizes that he is not the body but is a spiritual soul, there is no question of his becoming a *hari-jana.* Those who do not follow in the footsteps of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu and His disciplic succession cannot distinguish between matter and spirit, and therefore all their ideas are but a mixed-up hodgepodge of problems. They are virtually lost in the bewildering network of Māyādevī.

### Translation

**“As an incarnation of God, You are delivering so many fallen souls. I am also a greatly unhappy fallen soul. Kindly deliver me by Your mercy.”**

### Purport

It appears that although Gopāla Cāpāla was sinful, talkative and insulting, he nevertheless had the qualification of simplicity. Thus he believed Caitanya Mahāprabhu to be the incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead who had come to deliver all fallen souls, and he appealed for his own deliverance, seeking the mercy of the Lord. He did not know, however, that the deliverance of the fallen does not consist of curing their bodily diseases, although it is also a fact that when a man is delivered from the material clutches his material bodily diseases are automatically cured. Gopāla Cāpāla simply wanted to be delivered from the bodily sufferings of leprosy, but Śrī Caitanya, although accepting his sincere appeal, wanted to inform him of the real cause of suffering.

### Translation

**“O sinful person, envious of pure devotees, I shall not deliver you! Rather, I shall have you bitten by these germs for many millions of years.**

### Purport

We should note herein that all our sufferings in this material world, especially from disease, are due to our past sinful activities. And of all sinful activities, actions directed against a pure devotee out of sheer envy are considered extremely severe. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu wanted Gopāla Cāpāla to understand the cause of his suffering. Any person who disturbs a pure devotee engaged in broadcasting the holy name of the Lord is certainly punished like Gopāla Cāpāla. This is the instruction of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. As we shall see, one who offends a pure devotee can never satisfy Caitanya Mahāprabhu unless and until he sincerely regrets his offense and thus rectifies it.

### Synonyms

*śrīvāse* — unto Śrīvāsa Ṭhākura; *karāili* — you have caused to do; *tui* — you; *bhavānī*-*pūjana* — worshiping the goddess Bhavānī; *koṭi* *janma* — for ten million births; *habe* — there will be; *tora* — your; *raurave* — in hell; *patana* — fall down.

### Translation

**“You have made Śrīvāsa Ṭhākura appear to have been worshiping the goddess Bhavānī. Simply for this offense, you will have to fall down into hellish life for ten million births.**

### Purport

There are many tantric followers who, wishing to eat meat and drink wine, practice the black art of worshiping the goddess Bhavānī in a crematorium. Such fools also consider this *bhavānī-pūjā* to be as good as worship of Lord Kṛṣṇa in devotional service. But such abominable tantric activities performed by so-called *svāmīs* and *yogīs* are herein condemned by Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. He declares that such *bhavānī-pūjā* for drinking wine and eating meat quickly plunges one into hellish life. The method of worship itself is already hellish, and its results must also be hellish and nothing more.

Many rascals say that whatever way one accepts, one will ultimately reach Brahman. Yet we can see from this verse how such persons reach Brahman. Brahman spreads everywhere, but appreciation of Brahman in different objects leads to different results. In the *Bhagavad-gītā* (4.11) the Lord says, *ye yathā māṁ prapadyante tāṁs tathaiva bhajāmy aham:* “I reward everyone according to his surrender unto Me.” Māyāvādīs certainly realize Brahman in certain aspects, but realization of Brahman in the aspects of wine, women and meat is not the same realization of Brahman that devotees achieve by chanting, dancing and eating *prasādam.* Māyāvādī philosophers, being educated in paltry knowledge, think all sorts of Brahman realization one and the same and do not consider varieties. But although Kṛṣṇa is everywhere, by His inconceivable potency He is simultaneously not everywhere. Thus the Brahman realization of the tantric cult is not the same Brahman realization as that of pure devotees. Unless one reaches the highest point of Brahman realization, Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he is punishable. All people except Kṛṣṇa conscious devotees are to some proportion *pāṣaṇḍīs,*or demons, and thus they are punishable by the Supreme Lord, the Personality of Godhead, as stated below.

### Synonyms

*pāṣaṇḍī* — demons, atheists; *saṁhārite* — to kill; *mora* — My; *ei* — this; *avatāra* — incarnation; *pāṣaṇḍī* — atheist; *saṁhāri’* — killing; *bhakti* — devotional service; *karimu* — I shall do; *pracāra* — preaching.

### Translation

**“I have appeared in this incarnation to kill the demons \[pāṣaṇḍīs\] and, after killing them, to preach the cult of devotional service.”**

### Purport

Lord Caitanya’s mission is the same as that of Lord Kṛṣṇa, which He states in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (4.7-8):

*yadā yadā hi dharmasya* *glānir bhavati bhārata  
abhyutthānam adharmasya* *tadātmānaṁ sṛjāmy aham*

*paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ* *vināśāya ca duṣkṛtām  
dharma-saṁsthāpanārthāya* *sambhavāmi yuge yuge*

“Whenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice, O descendant of Bharata, and a predominant rise of irreligion — at that time I descend Myself. In order to deliver the pious and to annihilate the miscreants, as well as to reestablish the principles of religion, I advent Myself millennium after millennium.”

As explained here, the real purpose of an incarnation of Godhead is to kill the atheists and maintain the devotees. He does not say, like so many rascal incarnations, that atheists and devotees are on the same platform. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, or Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the real Personality of Godhead, does not advocate such an idea.

Atheists are punishable, whereas devotees are to be protected. To maintain this principle is the mission of all *avatāras,* or incarnations. One must therefore identify an incarnation by His activities, not by popular votes or mental concoctions. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu gave protection to devotees and killed many demons in the course of His preaching work. He specifically mentioned that the Māyāvādī philosophers are the greatest demons. Therefore He warned all others not to hear the Māyāvāda philosophy: *māyāvādi-bhāṣya śunile haya sarva-nāśa.* Simply by hearing the Māyāvāda interpretation of the *śāstras,* one is doomed (Cc. *Madhya* 6.169).

**After saying this, the Lord left to take His bath in the Ganges, and that sinful man did not give up his life but continued to suffer.**

It appears that an offender to a Vaiṣṇava continues to suffer and does not give up his life. We have actually seen that a great *vaiṣṇava-aparādhī* continuously suffered so much that it was difficult for him to move, and yet he did not die.

### Purport

Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura, in his *Anubhāṣya,* has given the following note in connection with the village Kuliyā. The village originally known as Kuliyā has developed into what is now the city of Navadvīpa. In various authorized books like the *Bhaktiratnākara, Caitanya-carita-mahākāvya, Caitanya-candrodaya-nāṭaka* and *Caitanya-bhāgavata* it is mentioned that the village of Kuliyā is on the western side of the Ganges. Even now, within the area known as Koladvīpa, there is a place known as *kuliāra gañja* and a place called *kuliāra daha,* both within the jurisdiction of the present municipality of Navadvīpa. In the time of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, the two villages on the western side of the Ganges named Kuliyā and Pāhāḍapura both belonged to the jurisdiction of Bāhiradvīpa. At that time the place on the eastern side of the Ganges now known as Antardvīpa was known as Navadvīpa. At that time the place on the eastern side of the Ganges now known as Antardvīpa was known as Navadvīpa. At Śrī Māyāpur that place is still known as Dvīpera Māṭha. There is another place of the name Kuliyā near Kāṅcaḍāpāḍā, but it is not the same Kuliyā mentioned here. It cannot be accepted as *aparādha-bhañjanera pāṭa,* or the place where the offense was excused, for that occurred in the above-mentioned Kuliyā on the western side of the Ganges. For business reasons many envious persons oppose excavation of the real place, and sometimes they advertise unauthorized places as the authorized one.

When one understands this fact with faith and love, he personally becomes free from all curses uttered by *brāhmaṇas* or anyone else. This incident is not mentioned in the *Caitanya-bhāgavata.*

### Purport

Mukunda Datta was once forbidden to enter the association of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu because of his mixing with the Māyāvādī impersonalists. When Lord Caitanya manifested His *mahā-prakāśa,* He called all the devotees one after another and blessed them, while Mukunda Datta stood outside the door. The devotees informed the Lord that Mukunda Datta was waiting outside, but the Lord replied, “I shall not soon be pleased with Mukunda Datta, for though he explains devotional service among devotees, he then goes to Māyāvādīs to hear from them the *Yoga-vāśiṣṭha-rāmāyaṇa,* which is full of Māyāvāda philosophy. For this I am greatly displeased with him.” Hearing the Lord speak in that way, Mukunda Datta, standing outside, was exceedingly glad that the Lord would at some time be pleased with him, although He was not pleased at that moment. But when the Lord understood that Mukunda Datta was going to give up the association of the Māyāvādīs for good, He was pleased, and He at once called to see Mukunda. Thus He delivered him from the association of the Māyāvādīs and gave him the association of pure devotees.

### Purport

Advaita Ācārya was a disciple of Mādhavendra Purī, Īśvara Purī’s spiritual master. Therefore Īśvara Purī, the spiritual master of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, was Advaita Ācārya’s Godbrother. In view of this, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu treated Advaita Ācārya as His spiritual master, but Śrī Advaita Ācārya did not like this behavior of Lord Caitanya, for He wanted to be treated as His eternal servant. Advaita Prabhu’s aspiration was to be a servant of the Lord, not His spiritual master. He therefore devised a plan to antagonize the Lord. He began to explain the path of philosophical speculation in the midst of some unfortunate Māyāvādīs, and when Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu heard about this, He immediately went there and in a very angry mood began to beat Advaita Ācārya. At that time, Advaita Ācārya, greatly pleased, began to dance, saying, “Just see how My desire has now been fulfilled! Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu used to treat Me honorably for so long, but now He is treating Me neglectfully. This is My reward. His affection for Me is so great that He wanted to save Me from the hands of the Māyāvādīs.” Hearing this statement, Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu was somewhat ashamed, but He was very pleased with Advaita Ācārya.

All the devotees rested there for some time and drank water from Śrīdhara’s damaged iron pot. The Lord accepted the water because the pot belonged to a devotee. Chand Kazi then returned home. The place where they rested is still situated on the northeastern side of Māyāpur, and it is known as *kīrtana-viśrāma-sthāna,* “the resting place of the *kīrtana* party.”

### Purport

On the *mahā-prakāśa* day, Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu embraced Haridāsa Ṭhākura and informed him that he was none other than an incarnation of Prahlāda Mahārāja. When Viśvarūpa took *sannyāsa,* Śacīmātā thought that Advaita Ācārya had persuaded Him to do so. Therefore she accused Advaita Ācārya of this, which was an offense at His lotus feet. Later Lord Caitanya induced His mother to take the dust of Advaita Ācārya’s lotus feet, and thus her *vaiṣṇava-aparādha* was nullified.

### Translation

**When a student interpreted the glories of the holy name as a prayer of exaggeration, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, greatly unhappy, immediately warned everyone not to see the student’s face henceforward.**

### Purport

Once when Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu explained the glories of the transcendental potency of the Lord’s holy name, the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra,* one unfortunate student said that such glorification of the holy name was an exaggeration in the *śāstras* to induce people to take to it. In this way the student interpreted the glories of the holy name. This is called *artha-vāda,* and it is one of the ten offenses at the lotus feet of the holy name of the Lord. There are many kinds of offenses, but the offense known as *nāma-aparādha,* an offense at the lotus feet of the holy name, is extremely dangerous. The Lord therefore warned everyone not to see the face of the offender. The Lord immediately took a bath in the Ganges with all His clothes on to teach everyone to avoid such a *nāma-aparādha.* The holy name is identical with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. There is no difference between the person God and His holy name. This is the absolute position of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore one who distinguishes between the Lord and His name is called a *pāṣaṇḍī,* or nonbeliever, an atheistic demon. Glorification of the holy name is glorification of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One should never attempt to distinguish between the Lord and His name or interpret the glories of the holy name as mere exaggerations.

### Translation

**“\[The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, said:\] ‘My dear Uddhava, neither through aṣṭāṅga-yoga \[the mystic yoga system to control the senses\], nor through impersonal monism or an analytical study of the Absolute Truth, nor through study of the Vedas, nor through austerities, charity or acceptance of sannyāsa can one satisfy Me as much as by developing unalloyed devotional service unto Me.’ ”**

### Purport

*Karmīs, jñānīs, yogīs, tapasvīs* and students of Vedic literature who do not have Kṛṣṇa consciousness simply beat around the bush and do not get any final profit because they have no clear knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Nor do they have faith in approaching Him by discharging devotional service, although everywhere such service is repeatedly emphasized, as it is in this verse from *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (11.14.20). The *Bhagavad-gītā* (18.55) also declares, *bhaktyā mām abhijānāti yāvān yaś cāsmi tattvataḥ:* “One can understand the Supreme Personality as He is only by devotional service.” If one wants to understand the Supreme Personality factually, he must take to the path of devotional service and not waste time in profitless philosophical speculation, fruitive activity, mystic yogic practice or severe austerity and penance. Elsewhere in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (12.5) the Lord confirms, *kleśo ’dhikataras teṣām avyaktāsakta-cetasām:* “For those whose minds are attached to the unmanifested, impersonal feature of the Supreme, advancement is very troublesome.” People who are attached to the impersonal feature of the Lord are obliged to take great trouble, yet nevertheless they cannot understand the Absolute Truth. As explained in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (1.2.11), *brahmeti paramātmeti bhagavān iti śabdyate.* Unless one understands the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the original source of both Brahman and Paramātmā, one is still in darkness about the Absolute Truth.

### Purport

This is a verse from *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (10.81.16) spoken by Sudāmā Vipra in the presence of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa. This and the previous verse quoted from *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* clearly indicate that although Kṛṣṇa is so great that it is not possible for anyone to satisfy Him, He exhibits His greatness by being personally satisfied even with one who is unqualified from so many angles of vision. Sudāmā Vipra was born in a family of *brāhmaṇas,* and he was a learned scholar and a class friend of Kṛṣṇa’s, yet he considered himself unfit to be strictly called a *brāhmaṇa.* He called himself a *brahma-bandhu,* meaning “one born in a *brāhmaṇa* family but not brahminically qualified.” Because of His great respect for *brāhmaṇas,* however, Kṛṣṇa embraced Sudāmā Vipra, although he was not a regular *brāhmaṇa* but a *brahma-bandhu,* or friend of a *brāhmaṇa* family. Murāri Gupta could not be called even a *brahma-bandhu* because he was born of a *vaidya* family and according to the social structure was therefore considered a *śūdra.* But Kṛṣṇa bestowed special mercy upon Murāri Gupta because he was a beloved devotee of the Lord, as stated by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. The purport of Śrī Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura’s elaborate discussion of this subject is that no qualification in this material world can satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, yet everything becomes successful simply through development of devotional service to the Lord.

The members of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness cannot even call themselves *brahma-bandhus.* Therefore our only means for satisfying Kṛṣṇa is to pursue the injunctions of Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, who says:

*yāre dekha, tāre kaha ‘kṛṣṇa’-upadeśa  
āmāra ājñāya guru hañā tāra’ ei deśa*

“Whomever you meet, instruct him on the teachings of Kṛṣṇa. In this way, on My order, become a spiritual master and deliver the people of this country.” (Cc. *Madhya* 7.128) Simply trying to follow the orders of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, we speak to the people of the world about *Bhagavad-gītā As It Is.* This will make us qualified to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa.

Because of this incident, that place is still known as Meghera-cara*.* Since the course of the Ganges has now changed, the village of the name Belapukhuriyā, which was formerly situated in a different place, called Tāraṇavāsa, has now become known as Meghera-cara*.* The *Madhya-khaṇḍa* of Śrīla Locana dāsa Ṭhākura’s *Caitanya-maṅgala* also relates that once at the end of the day, when evening clouds assembled overhead and thundered threateningly, all the Vaiṣṇavas were very much afraid. But the Lord took His *karatālas* in His hands and personally began chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra,* looking up toward the sky as if to direct the demigods in the higher planets. Thus all the assembled clouds dispersed, and as the sky became clear, with the moon rising, the Lord began dancing very happily with His jubilant and satisfied devotees.

At that time Gaurahari (Lord Caitanya) appeared on the scene, and He also began to hear the thousand names of Viṣṇu with full satisfaction. When He thus heard the holy name of Lord Nṛsiṁha, Lord Caitanya became absorbed in thought, and He became angry like Nṛsiṁha Prabhu in His angry mood. His eyes became red, His bodily hairs stood on end, all the parts of His body trembled, and He made a thundering sound. All of a sudden He took up a club, and people became greatly afraid, thinking, “We do not know what kind of offense we have now committed!” But then Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu adjusted His thoughts and sat down on His seat.

### Translation

**Then Lord Caitanya, adopting the mood of Lord Śiva, got on the man’s shoulders, and thus they danced together for a long time.**

### Purport

Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu adopted the mood of Lord Śiva, for He is Śiva also. According to the philosophy of *acintya-bhedābheda-tattva,* Lord Śiva is not different from Lord Viṣṇu, but still Lord Śiva is not Lord Viṣṇu, just as yogurt is nothing but milk and yet is not milk nevertheless. One cannot get the benefit of milk by drinking yogurt. Similarly, one cannot get salvation by worshiping Lord Śiva. If one wants salvation, one must worship Lord Viṣṇu. This is confirmed in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (9.4): *mat-sthāni sarva-bhūtāni na cāhaṁ teṣv avasthitaḥ.* Everything is resting on the Lord, for everything is His energy, yet He is not everywhere. Lord Caitanya’s adopting the mood of Lord Śiva is not extraordinary, but one should not therefore think that by worshiping Lord Śiva one is worshiping Lord Caitanya. That would be a mistake.

### Translation

**On another day an astrologer came who was said to know everything — past, present and future. Thus Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu received him with all honor and put this question before him.**

### Purport

*Brāhmaṇas* generally used to become astrologers, Āyur-vedic physicians, teachers and priests. Although highly learned and respectable, such *brāhmaṇas* went from door to door to distribute their knowledge. A *brāhmaṇa* would first go to a householder’s home to give information about the functions to be performed on a particular *tithi,* or date, but if there were sickness in the family, the family members would consult the *brāhmaṇa* as a physician, and the *brāhmaṇa* would give instruction and some medicine. Often, since the *brāhmaṇas* were expert in astrology, people would also be greatly inquisitive about their past, present and future.

Although the *brāhmaṇa* appeared at Lord Caitanya’s house as a beggar, Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu received him with great respect because he was a qualified *brāhmaṇa* who knew the astrological science perfectly. Although *brāhmaṇas* would go door to door just like beggars, they were honored as very respectable guests. This was the system in Hindu society five hundred years ago, during the time of Caitanya Mahāprabhu. This system was current even one hundred years ago; even fifty or sixty years ago, when we were children, such *brāhmaṇas* would visit householders like humble beggars, and people would derive great benefit from the mercy of such *brāhmaṇas.* The greatest benefit was that a householder could save a great deal of money from being spent on doctor bills because the *brāhmaṇas,* aside from explaining the past, present and future, could ordinarily cure all kinds of diseases simply by giving instructions and some medicine. Thus no one was bereft of the benefit of a first-class physician, astrologer and priest. The important members of ISKCON should give careful attention to our Dallas school, where children are being taught Sanskrit and English to become perfect *brāhmaṇas.* If they are actually trained as perfect *brāhmaṇas,* they can save society from rogues and ruffians; indeed, people can live happily under the protection of qualified *brāhmaṇas.* Therefore the *Bhagavad-gītā* (4.13) gives special stress to the division of society (*cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭaṁ guṇa-karmavibhāgaśaḥ*)*.* Unfortunately some people are now claiming to be *brāhmaṇas* simply by birthright, with no qualifications. Therefore the entire society is in chaos.

*ke āchiluṅ āmi pūrva janme kaha gaṇi’  
gaṇite lāgilā sarva-jña prabhu-vākya śuni’*

### Synonyms

*ke* *āchiluṅ* *āmi* — who I was; *pūrva* *janme* — in My previous birth; *kaha* — please say; *gaṇi’* — by your astrological calculation; *gaṇite* — to calculate; *lāgilā* — began; *sarva*-*jña* — a man who knows past, present and future; *prabhu*-*vākya* — the words of Lord Caitanya; *śuni’* — hearing.

### Translation

**“Please tell Me who I was in My previous birth,” the Lord said. “Please tell Me by your astrological computations.” Hearing the words of the Lord, the astrologer immediately began to calculate.**

### Purport

Through astrology one can know past, present and future. Modern Western astrologers have no knowledge of the past or future, nor can they perfectly say anything about the present. Herein we find, however, that after hearing Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s order, the astrologer immediately began his calculations. This was not a facade: he actually knew how to ascertain one’s past life through astrology. A still-existing treatise called the *Bhṛgu-saṁhitā* describes a system by which anyone can immediately get information about what he was in the past and what he is going to be in the future. The *brāhmaṇas* who went door to door as if beggars had perfect command of such vast knowledge. Thus the highest knowledge was easily available even to the poorest man in society. The poorest man could inquire from an astrologer about his past, present and future, with no need for business agreements or exorbitant payments. The *brāhmaṇa* would give him all the benefit of his knowledge without asking remuneration, and the poor man, in return, would offer a handful of rice, or anything he had in his possession, to satisfy the *brāhmaṇa.* In a perfect human society, perfect knowledge in any science — medical, astrological, ecclesiastical and so on — is available even to the poorest man, with no anxiety over payment. In the present day, however, no one can get justice, medical treatment, astrological help or ecclesiastical enlightenment without money, and since people are generally poor, they are bereft of the benefits of all these great sciences.

*gaṇi’ dhyāne dekhe sarva-jña, — mahā-jyotirmaya  
ananta vaikuṇṭha-brahmāṇḍa — sabāra āśraya*

### Synonyms

*gaṇi’* — by calculation; *dhyāne* — by meditation; *dekhe* — sees; *sarva*-*jña* — knower of everything; *mahā*-*jyotir*-*maya* — highly effulgent body; *ananta* — unlimited; *vaikuṇṭha* — spiritual world; *brahmāṇḍa* — planets; *sabāra* — of all of them; *āśraya* — shelter.

### Translation

**Through calculation and meditation, the all-knowing astrologer saw the greatly effulgent body of the Lord, which is the resting place of all the unlimited Vaikuṇṭha planets.**

### Purport

Here we get some information of the Vaikuṇṭha world, or spiritual world. *Vaikuṇṭha* means “without anxiety.” In the material world, everyone is full of anxiety, but another world, where there is no anxiety, is described in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (8.20):

*paras tasmāt tu bhāvo ’nyo* *’vyakto ’vyaktāt sanātanaḥ  
yaḥ sa sarveṣu bhūteṣu* *naśyatsu na vinaśyati*

“Yet there is another unmanifest nature, which is eternal and is transcendental to this manifested and unmanifested matter. It is supreme and is never annihilated. When all in this world is annihilated, that part remains as it is.”

As there are many planets within the material world, there are many millions of planets, called Vaikuṇṭhalokas, in the spiritual world. All these Vaikuṇṭhalokas, or superior planets, rest on the effulgence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As stated in the *Brahma-saṁhitā* (*yasya prabhā prabhavato jagad-aṇḍa-koṭi-*), the Brahman effulgence emanating from the body of the Supreme Lord creates innumerable planets in both the spiritual and material worlds; thus these planets are creations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The astrologer saw Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu to be the very same Personality of Godhead. We can just imagine how learned he was, yet he was traveling door to door, just like an ordinary beggar, for the highest benefit of human society.

Herein it is clearly indicated that the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Brahman, is, in the ultimate issue, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore a person is the beginning of all things. As confirmed in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (10.8), *mattaḥ sarvaṁ pravartate:* everything begins from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Supreme Lord is the supreme living entity. Therefore whatever exists, whether matter or spirit, is all but an emanation from the Supreme Person, or supreme life. The modern scientists’ theory that life begins from matter is nonsense. Both matter and life begin from life. Unfortunately the scientists do not know this scientific fact; they are drifting in the darkness of their so-called knowledge.

By the power of astrological science one can even ascertain the position of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Everything is to be identified by its symptoms. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is identified by the symptoms mentioned in the *śāstras.* It is not that anyone and everyone can become God without proof from *śāstras.*

### Translation

**“In My last birth I was born in the family of cowherd men, and I gave protection to the calves and cows. Because of such pious activities, I have now become the son of a brāhmaṇa.”**

### Purport

The words of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, the greatest authority, herein clearly indicate that one becomes pious simply by keeping cows and protecting them. Unfortunately, people have become such rascals that they do not even care about the words of an authority. People generally consider cowherd men lowly members of society, but herein Caitanya Mahāprabhu confirms that they are so pious that in their next lives they are going to be *brāhmaṇas.* The caste system has a specific purpose. If this scientific system is followed, human society will get the greatest benefit. Heeding this instruction by the Lord, people should serve cows and calves and in return get ample quantities of milk. There is no loss in serving the cows and calves, but modern human society has become so degraded that instead of giving protection to the cows and serving them, people are killing them. How can they expect peace and prosperity in human society while committing such sinful activities? It is impossible.

### Translation

**The astrologer said, “What I saw in meditation was full of opulence, and therefore I was confused.**

### Purport

It appears that the astrologer not only was a knower of past, present and future through astrological calculation, but was a great meditator as well. Therefore he was a great devotee and could see Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu to be the same personality as Kṛṣṇa. He was puzzled, however, about whether Kṛṣṇa and Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu were actually the same person.

### Purport

*Śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya rādhā-kṛṣṇa nahe anya:* in the vision of a perfect devotee, Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu is a combination of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa. One who sees Lord Caitanya to be different from Kṛṣṇa is under the illusory energy of the Lord. It appears that the astrologer was already an advanced devotee, and when he came into the presence of the Supreme Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, he became perfectly self-realized and could see that the Supreme Personality of Godhead Kṛṣṇa and Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu are one and the same Supreme Person.

### Translation

**The all-knowing astrologer concluded, “Whatever You may be or whoever You may be, I offer my respectful obeisances unto You!” By His causeless mercy, the Lord then gave him love of Godhead, thus rewarding him for his service.**

### Purport

The incident of Lord Caitanya’s meeting the all-knowing astrologer is not mentioned in the *Caitanya-bhāgavata,* but we cannot therefore say that it did not take place. On the contrary, we must accept the statement of Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī that whatever the *Caitanya-bhāgavata* did not mention he has especially mentioned in the *Caitanya-caritāmṛta.*

### Translation

**After drinking the water, Lord Caitanya became so ecstatic that He began to dance. Thus everyone saw the pastime of attracting the river Yamunā.**

### Purport

*Yamunākarṣaṇa-līlā* is the pastime of attracting the Yamunā. One day, Śrī Baladeva wanted the Yamunā River to come before Him, and when the river Yamunā refused, He took His plow, wanting to dig a canal so that the Yamunā would be obliged to come there. Since Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is the original form of Baladeva, in His ecstasy He asked everyone to bring honey. In this way, all the devotees standing there saw the *yamunākarṣaṇa-līlā.* In this *līlā,* Baladeva was accompanied by His girlfriends. After drinking a honey beverage called Vāruṇī, He wanted to jump into the Yamunā and swim with the girls. It is stated in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (10.65.25-30, 33) that Lord Baladeva asked the Yamunā to come near, and when the river disobeyed the order of the Lord, He became angry and thus wanted to snatch her near to Him with His plow. The Yamunā, however, very much afraid of Lord Balarāma’s anger, immediately came and surrendered unto Him, praying to the Lord, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and admitting her fault. She was then excused. This is the sum and substance of the *yamunākarṣaṇa-līlā.* The incident is also described in the prayer of Jayadeva Gosvāmī concerning the ten incarnations:

*vahasi vapuṣi viśade vasanaṁ jaladābhaṁ  
halahati-bhīti-milita-yamunābham  
keśava dhṛta-haladhara-rūpa jaya jagad-īśa hare*

### Purport

The International Society for Krishna Consciousness now has its world center in Navadvīpa, Māyāpur. The managers of this center should see that twenty-four hours a day there is chanting of the holy names of the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra,* with the addition of *haraye namaḥ, kṛṣṇa yādavāya namaḥ,* for this song was a favorite of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s. But all such *saṅkīrtana* must be preceded by the chanting of the holy names of the five *tattvas — śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya prabhu-nityānanda śrī-advaita gadādhara śrīvāsādi-gaura-bhakta-vṛnda.* We are already accustomed to chant these two *mantras — śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya prabhu-nityānanda śrī-advaita gadādhara śrīvāsādi-gaura-bhakta-vṛnda* and Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare. Now, after these, the other two lines — namely *haraye namaḥ, kṛṣṇa yādavāya namaḥ/ gopāla govinda rāma śrī-madhusūdana* — should be added, especially in Māyāpur. Chanting of these six lines should go on so perfectly well that no one there hears any vibration other than the chanting of the holy names of the Lord. That will make the center spiritually all-perfect.

### Purport

The *phaujadarā,* or city magistrate, was called the *kājī* (Kazi). The *jamidāras* (zamindars), or landholders (*maṇḍalerās*), levied taxes on the land, but keeping law and order and punishing criminals was the duty entrusted to the Kazi. Both the Kazi and the landholders were under the control of the governor of Bengal, which at that time was known as Subā-bāṅgālā. The districts of Nadia, Islāmpura and Bāgoyāna were all under the zamindar named Hari Hoḍa or his descendant known as Hoḍa Kṛṣṇadāsa. It is said that Chand Kazi was the spiritual master of Nawab Hussain Shah. According to one opinion his name was Maulānā Sirājuddina, and according to another his name was Habibara Rahamāna. Descendants of Chand Kazi are still living in the vicinity of Māyāpur. People still go to see the tomb of Chand Kazi, which is underneath a *campaka* tree and is known as Chand Kazi’s *samādhi.*

### Translation

**“For so long you did not follow the regulative principles of the Hindu religion, but now you are following them with great enthusiasm. May I know by whose strength you are doing so?**

### Purport

It appears that from the aggression of Baktiyār Khiliji in Bengal until the time of Chand Kazi, Hindus, or the followers of the Vedic principles, were greatly suppressed. Like the Hindus in present-day Pakistan, practically no one could execute the Hindu religious principles freely. Chand Kazi referred to this condition of Hindu society. Formerly the Hindus had not been straightforward in executing their Hindu principles, but now they were freely chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra.* Therefore it must have been by the strength of someone else that they were so daring.

Actually, that was the fact. Although the members of the so-called Hindu society had followed the social customs and formulas, they had practically forgotten to execute their religious principles strictly. But with the presence of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu they actually began following the regulative principles according to His order. That order is still existing, and anywhere and everywhere, in all parts of the world, one can execute it. That order is to become a spiritual master under the direction of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu by following the regulative principles, chanting daily at least sixteen rounds of the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra,* and preaching the cult of Kṛṣṇa consciousness all over the world. If we adhere to the order of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, we shall get spiritual strength without a doubt, and we shall be free to preach this cult of the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement and not be hampered by anyone.

### Translation

**“No one should perform saṅkīrtana on the streets of the city. Today I am excusing the offense and returning home.**

### Purport

Such orders stopping *saṅkīrtana* in the streets of the world’s great cities have been imposed upon members of the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement. We have hundreds of centers all over the world, and we have been specifically persecuted in Australia. In most cities of the Western world we have been arrested many times by the police, but we are nevertheless executing the order of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu by chanting on the streets of all the important cities, such as New York, London, Chicago, Sydney, Melbourne, Paris and Hamburg. We must remember that such incidents took place in the past, five hundred years ago, and the fact that they are still going on indicates that our *saṅkīrtana* movement is really authorized, for if *saṅkīrtana* were an insignificant material affair, demons would not object to it. The demons of the time tried to obstruct the *saṅkīrtana* movement started by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Similar demons are trying to obstruct the *saṅkīrtana* movement we are executing all over the world, and this proves that our *saṅkīrtana* movement is still pure and genuine, following in the footsteps of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

### Translation

**“The next time I see someone performing such saṅkīrtana, I shall certainly chastise him by not only confiscating all his property but also converting him into a Muslim.”**

### Purport

To convert a Hindu into a Muslim was an easy affair in those days. If a Muslim simply sprinkled water on the body of a Hindu, it was supposed that the Hindu had already become a Muslim. During the transition of the British in Bangladesh during the last Hindu-Muslim riots, many Hindus were converted into Muslims by having cows’ flesh forcibly pushed into their mouths. Hindu society was so rigid at the time of Lord Caitanya that if a Hindu were converted into a Muslim, there was no chance of his being reformed. In this way the Muslim population in India increased. None of the Muslims came from outside; social customs somehow or other forced Hindus to become Muslims, with no chance of returning to Hindu society. Emperor Aurangzeb also inaugurated a tax that Hindus had to pay because of their being Hindus. Thus all the poor Hindus of the lower class voluntarily became Muslims to avoid the tax. In this way the Muslim population in India increased. Chand Kazi threatened to convert the people into Muslims by the simple process of sprinkling water on their bodies.

### Purport

Gandhi is known for having started the movement of nonviolent civil disobedience in India, but about five hundred years before him, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu started His movement of nonviolent civil disobedience to the order of Chand Kazi. It is not necessary to commit violence to stop the opposition from hindering a movement, for one can kill their demoniac behavior with reason and argument. Following in the footsteps of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, whenever there are obstacles the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement should kill the opposition with reason and argument and thus stop their demoniac behavior. If we became violent in every case, it would be difficult for us to manage our affairs. We should therefore follow in the footsteps of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, who disobeyed the order of Chand Kazi but subdued him with reason and argument.

### Translation

**The loud sound of the chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra certainly made the Kazi very much afraid, and he hid himself within his room. Hearing the people thus protesting, murmuring in great anger, the Kazi would not come out of his home.**

### Purport

The Kazi’s order not to perform *saṅkīrtana* could stand only as long as there was no civil disobedience. Under the leadership of the Supreme Lord, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, the chanters, increasing in number, disobeyed the order of the Kazi. Thousands assembled together and formed parties, chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra* and making a tumultuous sound of protest. Thus the Kazi was very much afraid, as naturally one should be under such circumstances.

In the present day also, people all over the world may join together in the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement and protest against the present degraded governments of the world’s godless societies, which are based on all kinds of sinful activities. *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* states that in the Age of Kali, thieves, rogues and fourth-class people who have neither education nor culture capture the seats of governments to exploit the citizens. This is a symptom of Kali-yuga that has already appeared. People cannot feel secure about their lives and property, yet the so-called governments continue, and government ministers get fat salaries, although they are unable to do anything good for society. The only remedy for such conditions is to enhance the *saṅkīrtana* movement under the banner of Kṛṣṇa consciousness and protest against the sinful activities of all the world’s governments.

The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is not a sentimental religious movement; it is a movement for the reformation of all the anomalies of human society. If people take to it seriously, discharging this duty scientifically, as ordered by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, the world will see peace and prosperity instead of being confused and hopeless under useless governments. There are always rogues and thieves in human society, and as soon as a weak government is unable to execute its duties, these rogues and thieves come out to do their business. Thus the entire society becomes a hell unfit for gentlemen to live in. There is an immediate need for a good government — a government by the people, with Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Unless the masses of people become Kṛṣṇa conscious, they cannot be good men. The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement that Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu started by chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra* still has its potency. Therefore people should understand it seriously and scientifically and spread it all over the world.

The *saṅkīrtana* movement started by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is described in the *Caitanya-bhāgavata, Madhya-khaṇḍa,* twenty-third chapter, beginning with verse 241, which states, “My dear Lord, let my mind be fixed at Your lotus feet.” Following Lord Caitanya’s chanting, all the devotees reproduced the same sound He chanted. In this way the Lord proceeded, leading the entire party on the strand roads by the bank of the Ganges. When the Lord came to His own *ghāṭa,* or bathing place, He danced more and more. Then He proceeded to Mādhāi’s *ghāṭa.* In this way Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, the Supreme Lord, who was known as Viśvambhara, danced all over the banks of the Ganges. Then He proceeded to Bārakoṇā-ghāṭa, then Nāgariyā-ghāṭa, and, traveling through Gaṅgānagara, reached Simuliyā, a quarter at one end of the town. All these places surround Śrī Māyāpur. After reaching Simuliyā, the Lord proceeded toward the Kazi’s house, and in this way He reached the door of Chand Kazi.

Some of the men in Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s civil disobedience movement were agitated because they could not control their minds. But the Lord was thoroughly peaceful, sober and unagitated. Therefore when the Kazi came down to see Him, the Lord offered him proper respect and a seat because he was a respectable government officer. Thus the Lord taught us by His personal behavior. In pushing on our *saṅkīrtana* movement of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, we might have to face difficult days, but we should always follow in the footsteps of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and do the needful according to the time and circumstances.

### Translation

**“In our village relationship, Nīlāmbara Cakravartī Ṭhākura was my uncle. Such a relationship is stronger than a bodily relationship.**

### Purport

In India, even in the interior villages, all the Hindu and Muslim communities used to live very peacefully by establishing a relationship between them. The young men called the elderly members of the village by the name *cācā* or *kākā,* “uncle,” and men of the same age called each other *dādā,* “brother.” The relationship was very friendly. There were even invitations from Muslim houses to Hindu houses and from Hindu houses to Muslim houses. Both the Hindus and the Muslims accepted the invitations to go to one another’s houses to attend ceremonial functions. Even until fifty or sixty years ago, the relationship between Hindus and Muslims was very friendly, and there were no disturbances. We do not find any Hindu-Muslim riots in the history of India, even during the days of the Muslims’ rule over the country. Conflict between Hindus and Muslims was created by polluted politicians, especially foreign rulers, and thus the situation gradually became so degraded that India was divided into Hindustan and Pakistan. Fortunately, the remedy to unite not only the Hindus and Muslims but all communities and all nations can still be implemented by the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement on the strong basic platform of love of Godhead.

### Synonyms

### Translation

**“Since the bull and cow are your father and mother, how can you kill and eat them? What kind of religious principle is this? On what strength are you so daring that you commit such sinful activities?”**

### Purport

Everyone can understand that we drink the milk of cows and take the help of bulls in producing agricultural products. Therefore, since our real father gives us food grains and our mother gives us milk with which to live, the cow and bull are considered our father and mother. According to Vedic civilization, there are seven mothers, of which the cow is one. Therefore Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu challenged the Muslim Kazi, “What kind of religious principle do you follow by killing your father and mother to eat them?” In any civilized human society, no one would dare kill his father and mother for the purpose of eating them. Therefore Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu challenged the system of Muslim religion as patricide and matricide. In the Christian religion also, a principal commandment is “Thou shalt not kill.” Nevertheless, Christians violate this rule; they are very expert in killing and in opening slaughterhouses. In our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, our first provision is that no one should be allowed to eat any kind of flesh. It does not matter whether it is cows’ flesh or goats’ flesh, but we especially stress the prohibition against cows’ flesh because according to *śāstra* the cow is our mother. Thus the Muslims’ cow-killing was challenged by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

Chand Kazi agreed to talk with Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu on the strength of the scriptures. According to the Vedic scripture, if one can support his position by quoting from the *Vedas,* his argument is perfect. Similarly, when the Muslims support their position with quotations from the Koran, their arguments are also authorized. When Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu raised the question of the Muslims’ cow-killing and bull-killing, Chand Kazi came to the standard of understanding from his scriptures.

### Translation

**“On the path of material activities, there is regulation for killing cows. If such killing is done under the guidance of scripture, there is no sin.”**

### Purport

The word *śāstra* is derived from the *dhātu,* or verbal root, *śas. Śas-dhātu* pertains to controlling or ruling. A government’s ruling through force or weapons is called *śastra.* Thus whenever there is ruling, either by weapons or by injunctions, the *śas-dhātu* is the basic principle. Between *śastra* (ruling through weapons) and *śāstra* (ruling through the injunctions of the scriptures), the better is *śāstra.* Our Vedic scriptures are not ordinary lawbooks of human common sense; they are the statements of factually liberated persons unaffected by the imperfectness of the senses.

*Śāstra* must be correct always, not sometimes correct and sometimes incorrect. In the Vedic scriptures, the cow is described as a mother. Therefore she is a mother for all time; it is not, as some rascals say, that in the Vedic age she was a mother but she is not in this age. If *śāstra* is an authority, the cow is a mother always; she was a mother in the Vedic age, and she is a mother in this age also.

If one acts according to the injunctions of *śāstra,* he is freed from the reactions of sinful activity. For example, the propensities for eating flesh, drinking wine and enjoying sex are all natural to the conditioned soul. The path of such enjoyment is called *pravṛtti-marga.* The *śāstra* says, *pravṛttir eṣā bhūtānāṁ nivṛttis tu mahā-phalā:* one should not be carried away by the propensities of defective conditioned life; one should be guided by the principles of the *śāstras.* A child’s propensity is to play all day long, but it is the injunction of the *śāstras* that the parents should take care to educate him. The *śāstras* are there just to guide the activities of human society. But because people do not refer to the instructions of *śāstras,* which are free from defects and imperfections, they are therefore misguided by so-called educated teachers and leaders who are full of the deficiencies of conditioned life.

### Translation

**Refuting the Kazi’s statement, the Lord immediately replied, “The Vedas clearly enjoin that cows should not be killed. Therefore every Hindu, whoever he may be, avoids indulging in cow-killing.**

### Purport

In the Vedic scriptures there are concessions for meat-eaters. It is said that if one wants to eat meat, he should kill a goat before the goddess Kālī and then eat its meat. Meat-eaters are not allowed to purchase meat or flesh from a market or slaughterhouse. There are no sanctions for maintaining regular slaughterhouses to satisfy the tongues of meat-eaters. As far as cow-killing is concerned, it is completely forbidden. Since the cow is considered a mother, how could the *Vedas* allow cow-killing? Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu pointed out that the Kazi’s statement was faulty. In the *Bhagavad-gītā* (18.44) there is a clear injunction that cows should be protected: *kṛṣi-gorakṣya-vāṇijyaṁ vaiśya-karma svabhāva-jam.* “The duty of *vaiśyas* is to produce agricultural products, trade and give protection to cows.” Therefore it is a false statement that the Vedic scriptures contain injunctions permitting cow-killing.

In our practical preaching work we meet many Christians who talk about statements of the Bible. When we question whether God is limited or unlimited, Christian priests say that God is unlimited. But when we question why the unlimited God should have only one son and not unlimited sons, they are unable to answer. Similarly, from a scientific point of view, the answers of the Old Testament, New Testament and Koran to many questions have changed. But a *śāstra* cannot change at a person’s whim. All *śāstras* must be free from the four defects of human nature. The statements of *śāstras* must be correct for all time.

### Translation

**“My dear Nimāi Paṇḍita, what You have said is all true. Our scriptures have developed only recently, and they are certainly not logical and philosophical.**

### Purport

The *śāstras* of the *yavanas,* or meat-eaters, are not eternal scriptures. They have been fashioned recently, and sometimes they contradict one another. The scriptures of the *yavanas* are three: the Old Testament, the New Testament and the Koran. Their compilation has a history; they are not eternal like the Vedic knowledge. Therefore although they have their arguments and reasonings, they are not very sound and transcendental. As such, modern people advanced in science and philosophy deem these scriptures unacceptable.

Sometimes Christian priests come to us inquiring, “Why are our followers neglecting our scriptures and accepting yours?” But when we ask them, “Your Bible says, ‘Do not kill.’ Why then are you killing so many animals daily?” they cannot answer. Some of them imperfectly answer that the animals have no souls. But then we ask them, “How do you know that animals have no souls? Animals and children are of the same nature. Does this mean that the children of human society also have no souls?” According to the Vedic scriptures, within the body is the owner of the body, the soul. In the *Bhagavad-gītā* (2.13) it is said:

*dehino ’smin yathā dehe* *kaumāraṁ yauvanaṁ jarā  
tathā dehāntara-prāptir* *dhīras tatra na muhyati*

“As the embodied soul continuously passes, in this body, from boyhood to youth to old age, the soul similarly passes into another body at death. The self-realized soul is not bewildered by such a change.”

Because the soul is within the body, the body changes through so many forms. There is a soul within the body of every living creature, whether animal, tree, bird or human being, and the soul is transmigrating from one type of body to another. When the scriptures of the *yavanas* — namely the Old Testament, New Testament and Koran — cannot properly answer inquisitive followers, naturally those advanced in scientific knowledge and philosophy lose faith in such scriptures. The Kazi admitted this while talking with Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. The Kazi was a very intelligent person. He had full knowledge of his position, as stated in the following verse.

*Pātasāha* refers to the king. Nawab Hussain Shah, whose full name was Ālā Uddīn Saiyad Husen Sā, was at that time (A.D. 1498-1521) the independent King of Bengal. Formerly he was the servant of the cruel Nawab of the Hābsī dynasty named Mujaḥphara Khān, but somehow or other he assassinated his master and became the King. After gaining the throne of Bengal (technically called Masnada), he declared himself Saiyad Husen Ālā Uddīn Seriph Mukkā. There is a book called *Riyāja Us-salātina,* whose author, Golām Husen, says that Nawab Hussain Shah belonged to the family of Mukkā Seriph. To keep his family’s glory, he took the name Seriph Mukkā. Generally, however, he is known as Nawab Hussain Shah. After his death, his eldest son, Nasaratsā, became King of Bengal (A.D. 1521-1533). This King also was very cruel. He committed many atrocities against the Vaiṣṇavas. As a result of his sinful activities, one of his servants from the Khojā group killed him while he was praying in the mosque.

**“ ‘Since that time, my tongue also always vibrates the sound “Hari, Hari.” I have no desire to say it, but still my tongue says it. I do not know what to do.’**

### Purport

Sometimes demoniac nonbelievers, not understanding the potency of the holy name, make fun of the Vaiṣṇavas when the Vaiṣṇavas chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra.* This joking is also beneficial for such persons. *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,* Sixth Canto, second chapter, verse 14, indicates that the chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra,* even in joking, in the course of ordinary discussion, in indicating something extraneous, or in negligence, is called *nāmābhāsa,* which is chanting that is almost on the transcendental stage. This *nāmābhāsa* stage is better than *nāmāparādha. Nāmābhāsa* awakens the supreme remembrance of Lord Viṣṇu. When one remembers Lord Viṣṇu, he becomes free from material enjoyment. Thus he gradually comes forward toward the transcendental service of the Lord and becomes eligible to chant the holy name of the Lord in the transcendental position.

### Translation

**“After hearing all this, I sent all the mlecchas back to their homes. Five or seven nonbelieving Hindus then approached me.**

### Purport

The word *pāṣaṇḍī* refers to nonbelievers engaged in fruitive activities and to idolatrous worshipers of many demigods. *Pāṣaṇḍīs* do not believe in one God, the Supreme Personality, Lord Viṣṇu; they think that all the demigods have the same potency as He. The definition of a *pāṣaṇḍī* is given in the *tantra-śāstra:*

*yas tu nārāyaṇaṁ devaṁ* *brahma-rudrādi-daivataiḥ  
samatvenaiva vīkṣeta* *sa pāṣaṇḍī bhaved dhruvam*

“A *pāṣaṇḍī* is one who considers the great demigods such as Lord Brahmā and Lord Śiva equal to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Nārāyaṇa.” (*Hari-bhakti-vilāsa,* 1.17)

The Supreme Personality of Godhead is *asamaurdhva;* in other words, no one can be equal to or greater than Him. But *pāṣaṇḍīs* do not believe this. They worship any kind of demigod, thinking it all right to accept whomever they please as the Supreme Lord. The *pāṣaṇḍīs* were against the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and now we see practically that they also do not like our humble attempts to spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness all over the world. On the contrary, these *pāṣaṇḍīs* say that we are spoiling the Hindu religion because people all over the world are accepting Lord Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead according to the version of *Bhagavad-gītā As It Is.* The *pāṣaṇḍīs* condemn this movement, and sometimes they accuse Vaiṣṇavas from foreign countries of being not bona fide. Even so-called Vaiṣṇavas — pseudo followers of the Vaiṣṇava cult — do not agree with our activities in making Vaiṣṇavas in the Western countries. Such *pāṣaṇḍīs* existed even during the time of Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and they continue to exist. Despite all the activities of these *pāṣaṇḍīs,* however, the prediction of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu will triumph: *pṛthivīte āche yata nagarādi grāma/ sarvatra pracāra haibe mora nāma.* “In every town and village, the chanting of My name will be heard.” No one can check the spread of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement because upon this movement is the benediction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

### Translation

**“ ‘According to Hindu scripture, God’s name is the most powerful hymn. If everyone hears the chanting of the name, the potency of the hymn will be lost.**

### Purport

In the list of offenses in the chanting of the holy name of the Lord, it is said, *dharma-vrata-tyāga-hutādi-sarva-śubha-kriyā-sāmyam api pramādaḥ:* to consider the chanting of the holy name of the Lord equal to the execution of some auspicious religious ceremony is an offense. According to the materialistic point of view, observing a religious ceremony invokes an auspicious atmosphere for the material benefit of the entire world. Materialists therefore manufacture religious principles to live comfortably and without disturbance in executing their material activities. Since they do not believe in the existence of God, they have manufactured the idea that God is impersonal and that to have some conception of God one may imagine any form. Thus they respect the many forms of the demigods as different representations or manifestations of the Lord. They are called *bahv-īśvara-vādīs,* or followers of thousands and thousands of gods. They consider the chanting of the names of the demigods an auspicious activity. Great so-called *svāmīs* have written books saying that one may chant any name — Durgā, Kālī, Śiva, Kṛṣṇa, Rāma, and so on — because any name is all right for invoking an auspicious atmosphere in society. Thus they are called *pāṣaṇḍīs* — unbelievers or faithless demons.

Such *pāṣaṇḍīs* do not know the actual value of the chanting of the holy name of Lord Kṛṣṇa. Foolishly proud of their material birth as *brāhmaṇas* and their consequently higher position in the social order, they think of the other classes — namely the *kṣatriyas, vaiśyas* and *śūdras* — as lower classes. According to them, no one but the *brāhmaṇas* can chant the holy name of Kṛṣṇa, for if others chanted the holy name, its potency would be reduced. They are unaware of the potency of Lord Kṛṣṇa’s name. The *Bṛhan-nāradīya Purāṇa* recommends:

*harer nāma harer nāma* *harer nāmaiva kevalam  
kalau nāsty eva nāsty eva* *nāsty eva gatir anyathā*

“For spiritual progress in this Age of Kali, there is no alternative, no alternative, no alternative to the holy name, the holy name, the holy name of the Lord.” The *pāṣaṇḍīs* do not accept that the potency of the holy name of Kṛṣṇa is so great that one can be delivered simply by chanting the holy name, although this is confirmed in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (12.3.51): *kīrtanād eva kṛṣṇasya mukta-saṅgaḥ paraṁ vrajet.* Any man from any part of the world who practices chanting of the holy name of Kṛṣṇa can be liberated and after death go back home, back to Godhead. The rascal *pāṣaṇḍīs* think that if anyone but a *brāhmaṇa* chants the holy name, the potency of the holy name is vanquished. According to their judgment, instead of delivering the fallen souls, the potency of the holy name is reduced. Believing in the existence of many gods and considering the chanting of the holy name of Kṛṣṇa no better than other hymns, these *pāṣaṇḍīs* do not believe in the words of the *śāstra* (*harer nāma harer nāma harer nāmaiva kevalam*)*.* But Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu confirms in His *Śikṣāṣṭaka, kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ:* one must chant the holy name of the Lord always, twenty-four hours a day. The *pāṣaṇḍīs,* however, are so fallen and falsely proud of having taken birth in *brāhmaṇa* families that they think that instead of delivering all the fallen souls, the holy name becomes impotent when constantly chanted by lower-class men.

Significant in verse 211 are the words *kṛṣṇera kīrtana kare nīca bāḍa bāḍa,* indicating that anyone can join in the *saṅkīrtana* movement. This is confirmed in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (2.4.18): *kirāta-hūṇāndhra-pulinda-pulkaśā ābhīra-śumbhā yavanāḥ khasādayaḥ.* This is a list of the names of *caṇḍālas*. The *pāṣaṇḍīs* say that when these lower-class men are allowed to chant, their influence is enhanced. They do not like the idea that others should also develop spiritual qualities, because this would curb their false pride in having taken birth in families of the elevated *brāhmaṇa* caste, with a monopoly on spiritual activities. But despite all protests from so-called Hindus and members of the *brāhmaṇa* caste, we are propagating the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement all over the world, according to the injunctions of the *śāstras* and the order of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Thus we are sure that we are delivering many fallen souls, making them bona fide candidates for going back home, back to Godhead.

ग्रामेर ठाकुर तुमि, सव तोमार जन ।

### Verse text

*grāmera ṭhākura tumi, saba tomāra jana  
nimāi bolāiyā tāre karaha varjana*

### Synonyms

*grāmera* — of this town; *ṭhākura* — the ruler; *tumi* — you; *saba* — all; *tomāra* — your; *jana* — people; *nimāi* — Nimāi Paṇḍita; *bolāiyā* — calling; *tāre* — unto Him; *karaha* — do; *varjana* — the punishment of making Him leave the town.

### Translation

**“ ‘Sir, you are the ruler of this town. Whether Hindu or Muslim, everyone is under your protection. Therefore please call Nimāi Paṇḍita and make Him leave the town.’**

### Purport

The word *ṭhākura* has two meanings. One meaning is “God” or “a godly person,” and another meaning is *kṣatriya.* Here the *pāṣaṇḍī brāhmaṇas* address the Kazi as *ṭhākura,* considering him the ruler of the town. There are different names by which to address the members of different castes. The *brāhmaṇas* are addressed as *mahārāja,* the *kṣatriyas* as *ṭhākura,* the *vaiśyas* as *śetha* or *mahājana,* and the *śūdras* as *caudhurī.* This etiquette is still followed in northern India, where the *kṣatriyas* are addressed as Ṭhākura Sāhab. The *pāsaṇḍīs* went so far as to request the magistrate, or Kazi, to have Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu expelled from the town because of His introducing *hari-nāma-saṅkīrtana.* Fortunately our Hare Kṛṣṇa movement all over the world, especially in the civilized world of Europe and America, has become very popular. Generally no one complains against us to have us removed from a city. Although such an attempt was indeed made in Melbourne, Australia, the attempt failed. Thus we are now introducing this Hare Kṛṣṇa movement in great cities of the world like New York, London, Paris, Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne and Auckland, and by the grace of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu everything is going on nicely. People are happy to accept the principle of chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra,* and the result is most satisfactory.

### Translation

**“The chanting of the holy name of Kṛṣṇa from your mouth has performed a wonder — it has nullified the reactions of all your sinful activities. Now you have become supremely pure.**

### Purport

Confirming the potency of the *saṅkīrtana* movement, these words from the very mouth of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu express how people can be purified simply by chanting the holy name of Lord Kṛṣṇa. The Kazi was a Muslim *mleccha,* or meat-eater, but because he several times uttered the holy name of Lord Kṛṣṇa, automatically the reactions of his sinful life were vanquished and he was fully purified of all material contamination. We do not know why the *pāṣaṇḍīs* of the present day protest that we are deteriorating the Hindu religion by spreading Kṛṣṇa consciousness all over the world and claiming all classes of men to the highest standard of Vaiṣṇavism. But these rascals disagree with us so vehemently that some of them do not allow European and American Vaiṣṇavas to enter the temples of Viṣṇu. Thinking religion to be meant for material benefit, these so-called Hindus have actually become vicious by worshiping the numerous forms of the demigods. In the next verse Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu confirms the Kazi’s purification.

### Translation

**“Because you have chanted three holy names of the Lord — Hari, Kṛṣṇa and Nārāyaṇa — you are undoubtedly the most fortunate and pious.”**

### Purport

Here the Supreme Lord, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, con-firms that anyone who chants the holy names Hari, Kṛṣṇa and Nārāyaṇa without offense is certainly extremely fortunate, and whether Indian or non-Indian, Hindu or non-Hindu, he immediately comes to the level of the most pious personality. We therefore do not care about the statements of *pāṣaṇḍīs* who protest against our movement’s making the members of other cities or countries into Vaiṣṇavas. We have to follow in the footsteps of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, executing our mission peacefully, or, if necessary, kicking the heads of such protesters.

Śrīvāsa Ṭhākura was so patient, however, that he did not allow anyone to express sorrow by crying, for he did not want the *kīrtana* going on at his house to be disturbed. Thus *kīrtana* continued without a sound of lamentation. But when the *kīrtana* was over, Caitanya Mahāprabhu, who could understand the incident, declared, “There must have been some calamity in this house.” When He was then informed about the death of Śrīvāsa Ṭhākura’s son, He expressed His regret, saying, “Why was this news not given to Me before?” He went to the place where the son was lying dead and asked him, “My dear boy, why are you leaving the house of Śrīvāsa Ṭhākura?” The dead son immediately replied, “I was living in this house as long as I was destined to live here. Now that the time is over, I am going elsewhere, according to Your direction. I am Your eternal servant, a dependent living being. I must act only according to Your desire. Beyond Your desire, I cannot do anything. I have no such power.” Hearing these words of the dead son, all the members of Śrīvāsa Ṭhākura’s family received transcendental knowledge. Thus there was no cause for lamentation. This transcendental knowledge is described in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (2.13): *tathā dehāntara-prāptir dhīras tatra na muhyati.* When someone dies, he accepts another body; therefore sober persons do not lament. After the discourse between the dead boy and Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, funeral ceremonies were performed, and Lord Caitanya assured Śrīvāsa Ṭhākura, “You have lost one son, but Nityānanda Prabhu and I are your eternal sons. We shall never be able to give up your company.” This is an instance of a transcendental relationship with Kṛṣṇa. We have eternal transcendental relationships with Kṛṣṇa as His servants, friends, fathers, sons or conjugal lovers. When the same relationships are pervertedly reflected in this material world, we have relationships as the sons, fathers, friends, lovers, masters or servants of others, but all these relationships are subject to termination within a definite period. If we revive our relationship with Kṛṣṇa, however, by the grace of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu our eternal relationship will never break to cause our lamentation.

### Purport

Nārāyaṇī was a niece of Śrīvāsa Ṭhākura, and later she became the mother of Śrīla Vṛndāvana dāsa Ṭhākura. In this connection the *sahajiyās* cite a malicious story that after eating the remnants of Lord Caitanya’s food Nārāyaṇī became pregnant and gave birth to Vṛndāvana dāsa Ṭhākura. The rascal *sahajiyās* may manufacture such false statements, but no one should believe them because they are motivated by enmity against the Vaiṣṇavas.

One day he was very pleased with the dancing of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu; indeed, he was enchanted. The Lord, understanding his attitude, showed him His original form as Kṛṣṇa. The tailor then began to dance, saying, “I have seen! I have seen!” He became absorbed in ecstatic love and began to dance with Lord Caitanya. Thus he became one of the foremost Vaiṣṇava adherents of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

### Translation

**As she took the dust of His lotus feet again and again, the Lord became unlimitedly unhappy.**

### Purport

This holding of a great personality’s lotus feet is certainly very good for the person who takes the dust, but this example of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s unhappiness indicates that a Vaiṣṇava should not allow anyone to take dust from his feet.

One who takes the dust of a great personality’s lotus feet transfers his sinful activities to that great personality. Unless the person whose dust is taken is very strong, he must suffer the sinful activities of the person who takes the dust. Therefore ordinarily it should not be allowed. Sometimes in big meetings people come to take the same advantage by touching our feet. On account of this, sometimes we have to suffer from some disease. As far as possible, no outsider should be allowed to touch one’s feet to take dust from them. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu personally showed this by His example, as explained in the next verse.

### Translation

**Immediately He ran to the river Ganges and jumped in to counteract the sinful activities of that woman. Lord Nityānanda and Haridāsa Ṭhākura caught Him and raised Him from the river.**

### Purport

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is God Himself, but He was playing the part of a preacher. Every preacher should know that being allowed to touch a Vaiṣṇava’s feet and take dust may be good for the person who takes it, but it is not good for the person who allows it to be taken. As far as possible, this practice should ordinarily be avoided. Only initiated disciples should be allowed to take this advantage, not others. Those who are full of sinful activities should generally be avoided.

### Translation

**“Why are You chanting the names ‘gopī gopī’ instead of the holy name of Lord Kṛṣṇa, which is so glorious? What pious result will You achieve by such chanting?”**

### Purport

It is said, *vaiṣṇavera kriyā-mudrā vijñeha nā bujhaya:* no one can understand the activities of a pure devotee. A student or neophyte devotee could not possibly understand why Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was chanting the name of the *gopīs,* nor should the student have asked the Lord about the potency of chanting *gopī gopī.* The neophyte student was certainly convinced of the piety in the chanting of Kṛṣṇa’s holy name, but this sort of attitude is also offensive. *Dharma-vrata-tyāga-hutādi-sarva-śubha-kriyā-sāmyam api pramādaḥ:* to chant the holy name of Kṛṣṇa in exchange for the achievement of piety is an offense. This, of course, was unknown to the student. Thus he innocently asked, “What piety is there in the chanting of the name *gopī*?” He did not know that there is no question of piety or impiety. The chanting of the holy name of Kṛṣṇa or the holy name *gopī* is on the transcendental platform of loving affairs. Since he was not expert in understanding such transcendental activities, his question was merely impudent. Thus Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, apparently greatly angry at him, reacted as follows.

### Translation

**Hearing the foolish student, the Lord became greatly angry and rebuked Lord Kṛṣṇa in various ways. Taking up a stick, He rose to strike the student.**

### Purport

It is mentioned in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* that when Uddhava came from Lord Kṛṣṇa with a message for the *gopīs,* all the *gopīs,* especially Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī, denounced Kṛṣṇa in various ways. Such denunciations, however, reflect an exuberant loving attitude that an ordinary man cannot understand. When the foolish student questioned Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Lord Caitanya similarly rebuked Lord Kṛṣṇa in loving exuberance. When Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was in the mood of the *gopīs* and the student advocated the cause of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, Lord Caitanya was greatly angry. Seeing His anger, the foolish student, who was an ordinary atheistic *smārta-brāhmaṇa,* foolishly misjudged Him. Thus he and a party of students were ready to strike the Lord in retaliation. After this incident, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu decided to take *sannyāsa* so that people would not commit offenses against Him, considering Him an ordinary householder, for in India even now a *sannyāsī* is naturally offered respect.

### Translation

**The brāhmaṇa student ran to a place where a thousand students were studying together. There he described the incident to them.**

### Purport

In this verse we find the word *dvija,* indicating that the student was a *brāhmaṇa.* Actually, in those days, only members of the *brāhmaṇa* class became students of Vedic literature. Schooling is meant especially for *brāhmaṇas;* previously there was no question of schooling for *kṣatriyas, vaiśyas* or *śūdras. Kṣatriyas* used to learn the technology of warfare, and *vaiśyas* learned business from their fathers or other businessmen; they were not meant to study the *Vedas.* At present, however, everyone goes to school, and everyone is given the same type of education, although no one knows what the result will be. The result, however, is most unsatisfactory, as we have seen in the Western countries especially. The United States has vast educational institutions where everyone is allowed to receive an education, but the result is that most students become like hippies.

Higher education is not meant for everyone. Only selected individuals trained in brahminical culture should be allowed to pursue a higher education. Educational institutions should not aim to teach technology, for a technologist cannot properly be called educated. A technologist is a *śūdra;* only one who studies the *Vedas* may properly be called a learned man (*paṇḍita*)*.* The duty of a *brāhmaṇa* is to become learned in the Vedic literature and teach the Vedic knowledge to other *brāhmaṇas.* In our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement we are simply teaching our students to become fit *brāhmaṇas* and Vaiṣṇavas. In our school at Dallas, the students are learning English and Sanskrit, and through these two languages they are studying all our books, such as *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, Bhagavad-gītā As It Is* and *The Nectar of Devotion.* It is a mistake to educate every student as a technologist. There must be a group of students who become *brāhmaṇas.* Without *brāhmaṇas* who study the Vedic literature, human society will be entirely chaotic.

### Translation

**When all the students thus resolved, criticizing Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, their intelligence was spoiled. Thus although they were learned scholars, because of this offense the essence of knowledge was not manifested in them.**

### Purport

In the *Bhagavad-gītā* it is said, *māyayāpahṛta-jñānā āsuraṁ bhāvam āśritāḥ:* when one becomes inimical to the Supreme Personnality of Godhead, adopting an atheistic attitude (*āsuraṁ bhāvam*), even if one is a learned scholar the essence of knowledge does not become manifested in him; in other words, the essence of his knowledge is stolen by the illusory energy of the Lord. In this connection Śrī Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura quotes a *mantra* from the *Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad* (6.23):

*yasya deve parā bhaktir* *yathā deve tathā gurau  
tasyaite kathitā hy arthāḥ* *prakāśante mahātmanaḥ*

The purport of this verse is that one who is unflinchingly devoted to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Viṣṇu, and similarly devoted to the spiritual master, with no ulterior motive, becomes a master of all knowledge. In the heart of such a devotee, the real essence of the Vedic knowledge becomes manifested. This essence is nothing but surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead (*vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyaḥ*)*.* Only unto one who fully surrenders to the spiritual master and the Supreme Lord does the essence of Vedic knowledge become manifested, not to anyone else. This same principle is emphasized by Śrī Prahlāda Mahārāja in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (7.5.24):

*iti puṁsārpitā viṣṇau* *bhaktiś cen nava-lakṣaṇā  
kriyate bhagavaty addhā* *tan manye ’dhītam uttamam*

“A person who directly applies these nine principles \hearing, chanting, remembering, etc.\] in the service of the Lord is to be understood as a greatly learned man who has assimilated the Vedic literatures very well, for the goal of studying the Vedic literature is to understand the supremacy of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa.” Śrīdhara Svāmī confirms in his commentary that first one must surrender to the spiritual master; then the process of devotional service will develop. It is not a fact that only one who diligently pursues an academic career can become a devotee. Even with no academic career, if one has full faith in the spiritual master and the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he develops in spiritual life and real knowledge of the *Vedas.* The example of Mahārāja Khaṭvāṅga confirms this. One who surrenders is understood to have learned the subject matter of the *Vedas* very nicely. One who adopts this Vedic process of surrender learns devotional service and is certainly successful. One who is very proud, however, is unable to surrender either to the spiritual master or to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus he cannot understand the essence of any Vedic literature. *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* ([*Bhāg.* 11.11.18) declares:

*śabda-brahmaṇi niṣṇāto* *na niṣṇāyāt pare yadi  
śramas tasya śrama-phalo* *hy adhenum iva rakṣataḥ*

“If one is learned in the Vedic literature but is not a devotee of Lord Viṣṇu, his work is a useless waste of labor, just like the keeping of a cow that does not give milk.”

Anyone who does not follow the surrendering process but is simply interested in an academic career cannot make any advancement. His profit is only his labor for nothing. If one is expert in the study of the *Vedas* but does not surrender to a spiritual master or Viṣṇu, all his cultivation of knowledge is but a waste of time and labor.

### Purport

Here is a depiction of materialists who have no knowledge of devotional service. They may be very religious and may work very systematically or perform austerities and penances, but if they blaspheme the Supreme Personality of Godhead they are nothing but rogues. This is confirmed in the *Hari-bhakti-sudhodaya* (3.11):

*bhagavad-bhakti-hīnasya* *jātiḥ śāstraṁ japas tapaḥ  
aprāṇasyaiva dehasya* *maṇḍanaṁ loka-rañjanam*

If they are without knowledge of devotional service to the Lord, then great nationalism, fruitive, political or social work, science or philosophy are all simply like costly garments decorating a dead body. The only offense of persons adhering to these principles is that they are not devotees; they are always blasphemous toward the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His devotees.

### Translation

**“I shall accept the sannyāsa order of life, for thus people will offer Me their obeisances, thinking of Me as a member of the renounced order.**

### Purport

Among the members of the *varṇāśrama* institution’s social orders (*brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya* and *śūdra*), the *brāhmaṇa* is considered the foremost, for he is the teacher and spiritual master of all the other *varṇas.* Similarly, among the spiritual orders (*brahmacarya, gṛhastha, vānaprastha* and *sannyāsa*), the *sannyāsa* order is the most elevated. Therefore a *sannyāsī* is the spiritual master of all the *varṇas* and *āśramas,* and a *brāhmaṇa* is also expected to offer obeisances to a *sannyāsī.* Unfortunately, however, caste *brāhmaṇas* do not offer obeisances to a Vaiṣṇava *sannyāsī.* They are so proud that they do not offer obeisances even to Indian *sannyāsīs,* what to speak of European and American *sannyāsīs.* Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, however, expected that even the caste *brāhmaṇas* would offer respectful obeisances to a *sannyāsī* because five hundred years ago the social custom was to offer obeisances immediately to any *sannyāsī,* known or unknown.

The *sannyāsīs* of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement are bona fide. All the students of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement have undergone the regular process of initiation. As enjoined in the *Hari-bhakti-vilāsa* by Sanātana Gosvāmī, *tathā dīkṣā-vidhānena dvijatvaṁ jāyate nṛṇām:* by the regular process of initiation, any man can become a *brāhmaṇa.* Thus in the beginning the students of our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement agree to live with devotees, and gradually, having given up four prohibited activities — illicit sex, gambling, meat-eating and intoxication — they become advanced in the activities of spiritual life. When one is found to be regularly following these principles, he is given the first initiation (*hari-nāma*), and he regularly chants at least sixteen rounds a day. Then, after six months or a year, he is initiated for the second time and given the sacred thread with the regular sacrifice and rituals. After some time, when he advances still further and is willing to give up this material world, he is given the *sannyāsa* order. At that time he receives the title *svāmī* or *gosvāmī,* both of which mean “master of the senses.” Unfortunately, debauched so-called *brāhmaṇas* in India neither offer them respect nor accept them as bona fide *sannyāsīs.*Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu expected the so-called *brāhmaṇas* to offer respect to such Vaiṣṇava *sannyāsīs.* Nevertheless, it does not matter whether they offer respect, nor whether they accept these *sannyāsīs* as bona fide, for the *śāstra* describes punishment for such disobedient so-called *brāhmaṇas.* The śāstric injunction declares:

*devatā-pratimāṁ dṛṣṭvā* *yatiṁ caiva tridaṇḍinam  
namaskāraṁ na kuryād yaḥ* *prāyaścittīyate naraḥ*

“One who does not offer respect to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, to His Deity in the temple or to a *tridaṇḍī sannyāsī* must undergo *prāyaścitta* \[atonement\].” If one does not offer obeisances to such a *sannyāsī,* the prescribed *prāyaścitta* is to fast for one day.

### Synonyms

*praṇatite* — by offering obeisances; *ha’be* — there will be; *ihāra* — of such offenders; *aparādha* — the offenses; *kṣaya* — destruction; *nirmala* — pure; *hṛdaye* — in the heart; *bhakti* — devotional service; *karāiba* — I shall cause; *udaya* — the rising.

### Translation

**“Offering obeisances will relieve them of all the reactions to their offenses. Then, by My grace, devotional service \[bhakti\] will awaken in their pure hearts.**

### Purport

According to the Vedic injunctions, only a *brāhmaṇa* may be offered *sannyāsa.* The Śaṅkara-sampradāya (*ekadaṇḍa-sannyāsa-sampradāya*) awards the *sannyāsa* order only to caste *brāhmaṇas,* or born *brāhmaṇas,* but in the Vaiṣṇava system even one not born in a *brāhmaṇa* family may be made a *brāhmaṇa* according to the direction of the *Hari-bhakti-vilāsa* (*tathā dīkṣā-vidhānena dvijatvaṁ jāyate nṛṇām*)*.* Any person from any part of the world may be made a *brāhmaṇa* by the regular process of initiation, and when he follows brahminical behavior, observing the principle of abstaining from intoxication, illicit sex, meat-eating and gambling, he may be offered *sannyāsa.* All the *sannyāsīs* in the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, who are preaching all over the world, are regular *brāhmaṇa-sannyāsīs.* Thus the so-called caste *brāhmaṇas* should not object to offering them respectful obeisances. By offering such obeisances, as recommended by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, they will diminish their offenses and automatically awaken to their natural position of devotional service. As it is said, *nitya-siddha kṛṣṇa-prema sādhya kabhu naya: kṛṣṇa-prema* can be awakened in a purified heart. The more we offer obeisances to *sannyāsīs,* especially Vaiṣṇava *sannyāsīs,* the more we diminish our offenses and purify our hearts. Only in a purified heart can *kṛṣṇa-prema* awaken. This is the process of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s cult, the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement.

According to the system of Vedic society, whenever an unknown *sannyāsī* comes to a village or town, someone must invite him to take *prasādam* in his home. *Sannyāsīs* generally take *prasādam* in the house of a *brāhmaṇa* because the *brāhmaṇa* worships the Lord Nārāyaṇa *śilā,* or *śālagrāma-śilā,* and therefore there is *prasādam* that the *sannyāsī* may take. Keśava Bhāratī accepted the invitation of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Thus the Lord had a good opportunity to explain His desire to take *sannyāsa* from him.

### Purport

At the end of His twenty-fourth year, at the end of the fortnight of the waxing moon, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu left Navadvīpa and crossed the river Ganges at a place known as Nidayāra-ghāṭa. Then He reached Kaṇṭaka-nagara, or Kāṭoyā (Katwa), where He accepted *ekadaṇḍa-sannyāsa* according to the Śaṅkarite system. Since Keśava Bhāratī belonged to the Śaṅkarite sect, he could not initiate Caitanya Mahāprabhu into the Vaiṣṇava *sannyāsa* order, whose members carry the *tridaṇḍa.*

Candraśekhara Ācārya assisted in the routine ceremonial work of the Lord’s acceptance of *sannyāsa.* By the order of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, *kīrtana* was performed for the entire day, and at the end of the day the Lord shaved off His hair. On the next day He became a regular *sannyāsī,* with one rod (*ekadaṇḍa*)*.* From that day on, His name was Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya. Before that, He was known as Nimāi Paṇḍita. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, in the *sannyāsa* order, traveled all over Rāḍhadeśa, the region where the Ganges River cannot be seen. Keśava Bhāratī accompanied Him for some distance.

स्वमाधुर्य राधा–प्रेमरस आस्वादिते ।

### Synonyms

### Translation

**To taste the mellows of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī’s loving affairs in Her relationship with Kṛṣṇa, and to understand the reservoir of pleasure in Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Himself, as Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, accepted the mood of Rādhārāṇī.**

### Purport

In this connection Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura writes in his *Anubhāṣya,* “Śrī Gaurasundara is Kṛṣṇa Himself with the attitude of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu never gave up the attitude of the *gopīs.* He remained everlastingly predominated by Kṛṣṇa and never accepted the part of the predominator by imitating conjugal love with an ordinary woman, as *sahajiyās* generally do. He never placed Himself in the position of a debauchee. Lusty materialists like the members of the *sahajiyā-sampradāya* hanker after women, even others’ wives. But when they try to ascribe the responsibility for their lusty activities to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, they become offenders to Svarūpa Dāmodara and Śrīla Vṛndāvana dāsa Ṭhākura. In *Śrī Caitanya-bhāgavata, Ādi-khaṇḍa,* chapter fifteen, it is said:

*sabe para-strīra prati nāhi parihāsa  
strī dekhi’ dūre prabhu hayena eka-pāśa*

‘Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu never even joked with others’ wives. As soon as He saw a woman coming, He would immediately give her ample room to pass without talking.’ He was extremely strict regarding the association of women. The *sahajiyās,* however, pose as followers of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu although they indulge in lusty affairs with women. In His youth Lord Caitanya was very humorous with everyone, but He never joked with any woman, nor in this incarnation did He talk about women. The *gaurāṅga-nāgarī* party is not approved by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu or Vṛndāvana dāsa Ṭhākura. Even though one may offer all kinds of prayers to Caitanya Mahāprabhu, one should strictly avoid worshiping Him as the Gaurāṅga Nāgara. The personal behavior of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and the verses written by Śrī Vṛndāvana dāsa Ṭhākura have completely repudiated the lusty desires of the *gaurāṅga-nāgarīs.*”

The wonderful feelings of the gopīs in ecstatic parama-rasa with Kṛṣṇa constitute the greatest mystery in spiritual life.”**

### Purport

In verses 296 through 301 the emotional devoted service of Śrī Nityānanda, Śrī Advaita Prabhu and others has been fully described. Describing such individual service, the *Gaura-gaṇoddeśa-dīpikā* (11-16) declares that although Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu appeared as a devotee, He is none other than the son of Nanda Mahārāja. Similarly, although Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu appeared as Lord Caitanya’s assistant, He is none other than Baladeva, the carrier of the plow*.* Advaita Ācārya is the incarnation of Sadāśiva from the spiritual world. All the devotees headed by Śrīvāsa Ṭhākura are His marginal energy, whereas the devotees headed by Gadādhara Paṇḍita are manifestations of His internal potency.

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Advaita Prabhu and Nityānanda Prabhu all belong to the *viṣṇu-tattva* category. Because Lord Caitanya is an ocean of mercy, He is addressed as *mahāprabhu,* whereas Nityānanda and Advaita, being two great personalities who assist Lord Caitanya, are addressed as *prabhu.* Thus there are two *prabhus* and one *mahāprabhu.* Gadādhara Gosvāmī is a representative of a perfect *brāhmaṇa* spiritual master. Śrīvāsa Ṭhākura represents a perfect *brāhmaṇa* devotee. These five are known as the Pañca-tattva.

**In kṛṣṇa-līlā the Lord’s complexion is blackish. Holding a flute to His mouth, He enjoys as a cowherd boy. Now the selfsame person has appeared with a fair complexion, sometimes acting as a brāhmaṇa and sometimes accepting the renounced order of life.**

*sei kṛṣṇa, sei gopī, — parama virodha  
acintya caritra prabhura ati sudurbodha*

### Synonyms

*sei* *kṛṣṇa* — that Kṛṣṇa; *sei* *gopī* — that *gopī*; *parama* *virodha* — very contradictory; *acintya* — inconceivable; *caritra* — character; *prabhura* — of the Lord; *ati* — very; *sudurbodha* — difficult to understand.

### Translation

**He is Kṛṣṇa, yet He has accepted the mood of the gopīs. How is it so? It is the inconceivable character of the Lord, which is very difficult to understand.**

### Purport

Kṛṣṇa’s accepting the part of the *gopīs* is certainly contradictory according to any mundane calculations, but the Lord, by His inconceivable character, may act like the *gopīs* and feel separation from Kṛṣṇa, although He is Kṛṣṇa Himself. Such a contradiction can be reconciled only in the Supreme Personality of Godhead because He has energy that is inconceivable (*acintya*), which can make possible that which is impossible to do (*aghaṭa-ghaṭana-patīyasī*)*.* Such contradictions are very difficult to understand unless a devotee strictly follows the Vaiṣṇava philosophy under the direction of the Gosvāmīs. Therefore Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī ends every chapter with this verse:

*śrī-rūpa-raghunātha-pade yāra āśa  
caitanya-caritāmṛta kahe kṛṣṇadāsa*

“Praying at the lotus feet of Śrī Rūpa and Śrī Raghunātha, always desiring their mercy, I*,* Kṛṣṇadāsa, narrate *Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta,* following in their footsteps.”

In a song by Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura it is stated:

*rūpa-raghunātha-pade ha-ibe ākuti  
kabe hāma bujhaba se yugala-pīriti*

The conjugal love between Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa, which is called *yugala-pīriti,* is not understandable by mundane scholars, artists or poets. It is simply to be understood by devotees who strictly follow in the footsteps of the six Gosvāmīs. Sometimes so-called artists and poets try to understand the love affairs of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa, and they publish cheap books of poetry and pictures on the subject. Unfortunately, however, they do not understand the transcendental affairs of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa even to the smallest degree. They are simply meddling in a matter in which they are not fit even to enter.

There he is put into boiling oil called *kumbhī-pāka,* from which there is no deliverance. Kumbhīpāka is meant for persons who are unnecessarily envious. Those who are envious of the activities of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu are punished in that hellish condition.
