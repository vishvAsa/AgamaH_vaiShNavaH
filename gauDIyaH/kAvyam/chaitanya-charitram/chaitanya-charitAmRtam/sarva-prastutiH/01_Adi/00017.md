CHAPTER SIXTEEN

This chapter fully describes Lord Caitanya’s *kaiśora-līlā,* or the activities He performed just before attaining youth. During this time He studied deeply and was victorious over greatly learned scholars. During His *kaiśora-līlā* the Lord also sported in the water. He went to East Bengal to secure financial assistance, cultivate knowledge and introduce the *saṅkīrtana* movement, and there He met Tapana Miśra, whom He instructed about spiritual advancement and ordered to go to Vārāṇasī. While Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu was touring East Bengal, His wife, Lakṣmīdevī, was bitten by a serpent or by the serpent of separation, and thus she left this world. When the Lord returned home, He saw that His mother was overwhelmed with grief because of Lakṣmīdevī’s death. Therefore at her request He later married His second wife, Viṣṇupriyā-devī. This chapter also describes the Lord’s argument with Keśava Kāśmīrī, the celebrated scholar, and the Lord’s criticism of his prayer glorifying mother Ganges. In this prayer the Lord found five kinds of literary ornaments and five kinds of literary faults, thus defeating the *paṇḍita.* Later the Kāśmīrī Paṇḍita, who was known to have been victorious all over the country, submitted himself to the goddess of learning, and by her order he met Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu on the morning of the next day and surrendered unto Him.

कृपासुधा–सरिद्यस्य विश्वमाप्लावय़न्त्यपि ।  
नीचगैव सदा भाति तं चैतन्यप्रभुं भजे ॥ १ ॥

### Verse text

*kṛpā-sudhā-sarid yasya  
viśvam āplāvayanty api  
nīca-gaiva sadā bhāti  
taṁ caitanya-prabhuṁ bhaje*

### Synonyms

*kṛpā*-*sudhā* — of the nectar of the mercy; *sarit* — river; *yasya* — whose; *viśvam* — the whole universe; *āplāvayantī* — inundating; *api* — although; *nīca*-*gā* *eva* — more inclined to the poor and fallen; *sadā* — always; *bhāti* — is manifest; *tam* — Him; *caitanya*-*prabhum* — Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu; *bhaje* — I worship.

### Translation

**I worship Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, whose nectarean mercy flows like a great river, inundating the entire universe. Just as a river flows downstream, Lord Caitanya especially extends Himself to the fallen.**

### Purport

Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura has sung, *śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya prabhu dayā kara more.* He prays for Lord Caitanya’s mercy because He is the mercy incarnation, having appeared especially to reclaim the fallen souls. The more fallen one is, the greater one’s claim to the favor of Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. One must only be very sincere and serious. Despite being contaminated by all the bad qualities of this Kali-yuga, if one surrenders unto the lotus feet of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, the Lord will surely and certainly deliver him. The best example is Jagāi and Mādhāi. In this Age of Kali practically everyone is like Jagāi and Mādhāi, but the *saṅkīrtana* movement inaugurated by Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu is still flowing like a great river, inundating the entire world, and thus the International Society for Krishna Consciousness is successfully claiming all fallen souls to free them from contamination.

Since He is therefore the husband or Lord of both goddesses, I offer my obeisances unto Him.**

### Purport

Although Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and His devotees in disciplic succession can defeat all kinds of learned scholars, scientists and philosophers in arguments, thus establishing the supremacy of the Personality of Godhead, their main business as preachers is to introduce *saṅkīrtana* everywhere. Simply to defeat scholars and philosophers is not the occupation of a preacher. Preachers must simultaneously introduce the *saṅkīrtana* movement, for that is the mission of the Caitanya cult.

### Verse text

*bahu-śāstre bahu-vākye citte bhrama haya  
sādhya-sādhana śreṣṭha nā haya niścaya*

### Synonyms

### Translation

**If one becomes a bookworm, reading many books and scriptures and hearing many commentaries and the instructions of many men, this will produce doubt within his heart. One cannot in this way ascertain the real goal of life.**

### Purport

In *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (7.13.8) it is said, *granthān naivābhyased bahūn na vyākhyām upayuñjīta:* “One should not read many books, nor should one try to make a profession of reciting many books, especially if one is a devotee.” One must give up the ambition to be a learned scholar and in this way earn a worldly reputation and financial facilities. If one diverts his attention to studying many books, he cannot fix his mind in devotional service, nor can he understand many scriptures, for they are full of grave statements and meanings. In this connection Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura gives his opinion that those who are attracted to studying many kinds of literature concerning various subject matters, especially fruitive activities and philosophical speculation, are deprived of unalloyed devotional service because of their splayed attention.

Man has a general tendency toward fruitive activities, religious ritualistic ceremonies and philosophical speculation. A living entity thus bewildered since time immemorial does not understand the real goal of life, and thus his activities in life are wasted. Innocent persons misled in this way are deprived of unalloyed *kṛṣṇa-bhakti,* devotional service to the Lord. Tapana Miśra is a vivid example of such a person. He was a learned scholar, but he could not ascertain what the goal of life is. Therefore he was given a chance to hear Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu instructing Sanātana Gosvāmī. Lord Caitanya’s instruction to Tapana Miśra is especially significant for persons who loiter here and there collecting books and reading none of them, thus becoming bewildered regarding the aim of life.

### Translation

**The Lord, being satisfied, instructed him about the object of life and the process for attaining it. He instructed him that the basic principle of success is to chant the holy name of the Lord \[the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra\].**

### Purport

The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is based upon this instruction of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu that one must chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra* regularly and according to the prescribed principles. We simply ask our Western students to chant at least sixteen rounds a day, but sometimes we find that they fail to chant even these sixteen rounds, and instead they bring many austere books and a worshiping method that diverts their attention in so many ways. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s cult is based upon the chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra.* Lord Caitanya first advised Tapana Miśra to fix his mind on this chanting. We, the members of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, must strictly follow this advice of Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

### Translation

**I cannot understand the inconceivable pastimes of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, for although Tapana Miśra wanted to live with Him in Navadvīpa, the Lord advised him to go to Vārāṇasī.**

### Purport

When Tapana Miśra met Him, Caitanya Mahāprabhu was living in household life, and there was no indication that in the future He would accept the *sannyāsa* order. But by asking Tapana Miśra to go to Vārāṇasī, He indicated that in the future He would accept *sannyāsa* and that when He would teach Sanātana Gosvāmī, Tapana Miśra would take advantage of the opportunity to learn the object of life and the real process for attaining it.

### Purport

Following in the footsteps of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is distributing the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra* and inducing people all over the world to chant. We are giving people an immense treasury of transcendental literature, translated into all the important languages of the world, and by the grace of Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu this literature is selling profusely and people are chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra* with great delight. This is the preaching process of the Caitanya cult. Since the Lord wanted this cult preached all over the world, the International Society for Krishna Consciousness is acting in a humble way so that the vision of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu may be fulfilled all over the world, especially in the Western countries.

### Translation

### Purport

As stated in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (8.6), *yaṁ yaṁ vāpi smaran bhāvaṁ tyajaty ante kalevaram:* one’s practice in thinking throughout his entire life determines the quality of his thoughts at death, and thus at death one obtains a suitable body. According to this principle, Lakṣmīdevī, the goddess of fortune from Vaikuṇṭha, who was absorbed in thought of the Lord in separation from Him, certainly went back home to Vaikuṇṭhaloka after death.

### Translation

**When the Lord returned home, bringing with Him great wealth and many followers, He spoke to Śacīdevī about transcendental knowledge to relieve her of the grief she was suffering.**

### Purport

It is stated in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (2.13):

*dehino ’smin yathā dehe* *kaumāraṁ yauvanaṁ jarā  
tathā dehāntara-prāptir* *dhīras tatra na muhyati*

“As the embodied soul continuously passes, in this body, from boyhood to youth to old age, the soul similarly passes into another body at death. The self-realized soul is not bewildered by such a change.” Such verses from the *Bhagavad-gītā* or any other Vedic literature give valuable instructions on the occasion of someone’s passing away. By discussing such instructions from the *Bhagavad-gītā* or *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,* a sober man can certainly understand that the soul never dies but rather passes from one body to another. This is called transmigration of the soul. A soul comes into this material world and creates bodily relationships with a father, a mother, sisters, brothers, a wife and children, but all these relationships pertain to the body, not the soul. Therefore, as described in the *Bhagavad-gītā, dhīras tatra na muhyati:* one who is sober is not disturbed by such phenomenal changes within this material world. Such instructions are called *tattva-kathā,* or real truth.

### Translation

**Then Lord Caitanya married Viṣṇupriyā, the goddess of fortune, and thereafter He conquered a champion of learning named Keśava Kāśmīrī.**

### Purport

As in the modern day there are many champions in sports, so in bygone days there were many learned scholars in India who were champions in learning. One such person was Keśava Kāśmīrī, who came from the state of Kashmir. He traveled all over India and at last came to Navadvīpa to challenge the learned scholars there. Unfortunately he could not conquer the learned scholars in Navadvīpa, for he was defeated by the boy scholar Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Later he understood that Caitanya Mahāprabhu is none other than the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus he surrendered unto Him and later became a pure Vaiṣṇava in the *sampradāya* of Nimbārka. He wrote *Kaustubha-prabhā,* a commentary on the *Vedānta* commentary of the Nimbārka-sampradāya, which is known as the *Pārijāta-bhāṣya.*

The *Bhakti-ratnākara* mentions Keśava Kāśmīrī and lists his predecessors in the disciplic succession of the Nimbārka-sampradāya: (1) Śrīnivāsa Ācārya, (2) Viśva Ācārya, (3) Puruṣottama, (4) Vilāsa (5) Svarūpa, (6) Mādhava, (7) Balabhadra, (8) Padma, (9) Śyāma (10) Gopāla, (11) Kṛpā, (12) Deva Ācārya, (13) Sundara Bhaṭṭa, (14) Padmanābha, (15) Upendra, (16) Rāmacandra, (17) Vāmana, (18) Kṛṣṇa, (19) Padmākara, (20) Śravaṇa, (21) Bhūri, (22) Mādhava, (23) Śyāma, (24) Gopāla, (25) Balabhadra, (26) Gopīnātha, (27) Keśava, (28) Gokula and (29) Keśava Kāśmīrī. It is stated in the *Bhakti-ratnākara* that Keśava Kāśmīrī was a favorite devotee of mother Sarasvatī, the goddess of learning. By her grace he was an extremely influential scholar, and he was the greatest champion among all the scholars in the four corners of the country. Therefore he got the title *dig-vijayī,* which means “one who has conquered everyone in all directions.” He belonged to a very respectable *brāhmaṇa* family of Kashmir. Later, by the order of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, he gave up the profession of winning championships and became a great devotee. He joined the Nimbārka-sampradāya, one of the Vaiṣṇava communities of the Vedic culture.

Formerly Sanskrit schools first taught grammar very thoroughly, and this system continues even now. A student was supposed to study grammar carefully for twelve years in the beginning of his life, because if one is expert in the grammar of the Sanskrit language, all the *śāstras* are open to him. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was famous for teaching grammar to students, and therefore Keśava Kāśmīrī first referred to His position as a teacher of grammar. Keśava Kāśmīrī was very proud of his literary career; he was far above the first lessons of grammar, and so he thought the position of Nimāi Paṇḍita not at all comparable to his own*.*

### Translation

**“I understand that You teach Kalāpa-vyākaraṇa. I have heard that Your students are very expert in the word jugglery of this grammar.”**

### Purport

There are many schools of grammar in the Sanskrit language, the most famous of which are the systems of Pāṇini and the Kalāpa and Kaumudī grammars. There were different branches of grammatical knowledge, and a student of grammar was supposed to study them all in twelve years. Caitanya Mahāprabhu, who was famous as Nimāi Paṇḍita, taught grammar to His students, who became expert in dealing with the word jugglery of complicated grammar. Almost anyone expert in studying grammar interprets the *śāstras* in many ways by changing the root meanings of their words. A student of grammar can sometimes completely change the meaning of a sentence by juggling grammatical rules. Keśava Kāśmīrī indirectly taunted Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu by implying that although He was a great teacher of grammar, such grammatical jugglery of root meanings did not require great expertise. This was a challenge to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Because it was prearranged that Keśava Kāśmīrī would have to discuss the *śāstras* with Nimāi Paṇḍita, from the very beginning he wanted to bluff the Lord. Thus the Lord replied as follows.

**The Lord said, “Yes, I am known as a teacher of grammar, but factually I cannot impress My students with grammatical knowledge, nor can they understand Me very well.**

Since Keśava Kāśmīrī was a little puffed up, the Lord increased his artificial pride by presenting Himself as subordinate to him. Thus He flattered him as follows.

Replying to Keśava Kāśmīrī sarcastically, Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu indirectly minimized the value of his poetry by saying, “Yes, your compositions are so nice that no one but you and your worshipable mother, the goddess of learning, can understand them.” Keśava Kāśmīrī was a favorite devotee of mother Sarasvatī, the goddess of learning, but Caitanya Mahāprabhu, as the master of the goddess of learning, has the right to speak sarcastically of her devotees. In other words, although Keśava Kāśmīrī was proud of being favored by the goddess of learning, he did not know that she is controlled by Caitanya Mahāprabhu Himself because He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

*prabhu* — the Lord; *kahe* — replied; *devera* — of a superior power; *vare* — by benediction; *tumi* — you; *kavi*-*vara* — the most elevated poet; *aiche* — similarly; *devera* — of the Lord; *vare* — by the benediction; *keho* — someone; *haya* — becomes; *śruti*-*dhara* — one who can immediately remember.

### Translation

**The Lord replied, “By the grace of the Lord someone may become a great poet, and similarly by His grace someone else may become a great śruti-dhara who can memorize anything immediately.”**

### Purport

In this connection, *śruti-dhara* is a very important word. *Śruti* means “hearing,” and *dhara* means “one who can capture.” Formerly, before the beginning of Kali-yuga, almost everyone, especially among the intelligent men, the *brāhmaṇas,* was a *śruti-dhara.* As soon as a student heard any of the Vedic wisdom from his master, he would remember it forever. There was no need to refer to books, and therefore there were no written books in those days. The spiritual master delivered the Vedic hymns and their explanations to the student, who would then remember them forever, without consulting books.

To become a *śruti-dhara,* one who can remember simply by hearing, is a great achievement for a student. In the *Bhagavad-gītā* (10.41) the Lord says:

*yad yad vibhūtimat sattvaṁ* *śrīmad ūrjitam eva vā  
tat tad evāvagaccha tvaṁ* *mama tejo-’ṁśa-sambhavam*

“Know that all opulent, beautiful and glorious creations spring from but a spark of My splendor.”

As soon as we find anything extraordinary, we should understand that such an extraordinary manifestation is the special grace of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu replied to the champion, Keśava Kāśmīrī, that just as he was greatly proud of being a favorite devotee of mother Sarasvatī, so someone else, like Caitanya Mahāprabhu Himself, being favored by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, could become a *śruti-dhara* and thus memorize anything immediately simply by hearing it.

upamālaṅkāra guṇa, kichu anuprāsa*

### Synonyms

*vipra* *kahe* — the *brāhmaṇa* replied; *śloke* — in that verse; *nāhi* — there is not; *doṣera* — of fault; *ābhāsa* — even a tinge; *upamā*-*alaṅkāra* — simile or metaphor; *guṇa* — quality; *kichu* — something; *anuprāsa* — alliteration.

### Translation

**The brāhmaṇa replied, “There is not a tinge of fault in that verse. Rather, it has the good qualities of similes and alliteration.”**

### Purport

In the last line of the verse quoted by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, the letter *bha* is repeated many times, as in the words *bhavānī, bhartur, vibhavati* and *adbhuta.* Such repetition is called *anuprāsa,* or alliteration. The words *lakṣmīr iva* and *viṣṇoś caraṇa-kamalotpatti* are instances of *upamā-alaṅkāra,* for they exhibit metaphorical beauty. The Ganges is water, and Lakṣmī is the goddess of fortune. Since water and a person are not actually similar, the comparison is metaphorical.

### Translation

**“You are an ordinary student of grammar. What do You know about literary embellishments? You cannot review this poetry because You do not know anything about it.”**

### Purport

Keśava Kāśmīrī first wanted to bluff Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu by saying that since He was not an advanced student in literary style, He could not review a verse full of metaphors and literary ornaments. This argument has some basis in fact. Unless one is a medical man he cannot criticize a medical man, and unless one is a lawyer he cannot criticize a lawyer. Therefore Keśava Kāśmīrī first depreciated the Lord’s position. Because Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was to the champion a student of grammar, how could He dare criticize a great poet like him? Lord Caitanya, therefore, criticized the poet in a different way. He said that although He was certainly not advanced in a literary career, He had heard from others how to criticize such poetry, and as a *śruti-dhara,* possessing a complete memory, He could understand the process for such a review.

### Translation

### Purport

The statement *kariyāchi śravaṇa* (“I have heard it”) is very important in the sense that hearing is more important than directly studying or perceiving. If one is expert in hearing and hears from the right source, his knowledge is immediately perfect. This process is called *śrauta-panthā,* or the acquisition of knowledge by hearing from authorities. All Vedic knowledge is based on the principle that one must approach a bona fide spiritual master and hear from him the authoritative statements of the *Vedas.* It is not necessary for one to be a highly polished literary man to receive knowledge; to receive perfect knowledge from a perfect person, one must be expert in hearing. This is called the descending process of deductive knowledge, or *avaroha-panthā.*

### Translation

**“My dear sir, in this verse there are five faults and five literary ornaments. I shall state them one after another. Kindly hear Me and then give your judgment.**

### Purport

In the verse beginning with *mahattvaṁ gaṅgāyāḥ* there are five literary ornaments and five examples of faulty composition. There are two examples of the fault called *avimṛṣṭa-vidheyāṁśa* and one example each of the faults *viruddha-mati, punar-ukti* and *bhagna-krama.*

*Vimṛṣṭa* means “clean,” and *vidheyāṁśa* means “predicate.” It is a general rule of composition to establish a subject first and then give its predicate. For example, according to Sanskrit grammar if one says, “This man is learned,” his composition is in order. But if one says, “Learned is this man,” the composition is not in order. Such a flaw is called *avimṛṣṭa-vidheyāṁśa-doṣa,* or the fault of unclean composition. The subject matter to be known of the verse is the glorification of the Ganges, and therefore the word *idam* (“this”), or what is known, should have been placed before instead of after the glorification. The subject matter already known should be placed before the unknown so that its meaning will not be misconstrued.

The second instance of *avimṛṣṭa-vidheyāṁśa-doṣa* occurs in the words *dvitīya-śrī-lakṣmīr iva.* In this composition the word *dvitīya* (“second”) is *vidheya,* or unknown. Placing the unknown first to make the compound word *dvitīya-śrī-lakṣmīr* is another fault. The words *dvitīya-śrī-lakṣmīr iva* were intended to compare the Ganges to the goddess of fortune, but because of this fault the meaning of the compound word was bewildering.

The third fault is that of *viruddha-mati,* or contradictory conception, in the words *bhavānī-bhartuḥ.* The word *bhavānī* refers to the wife of Bhava, Lord Śiva. But since Bhavānī is already known as the wife of Lord Śiva, to add the word *bhartā,* “husband,” thus forming a compound meaning “the husband of the wife of Lord Śiva,” is contradictory, for thus it appears as if the wife of Lord Śiva had another husband.

The fourth fault is *punar-ukti,* or redundancy, which occurs when the verb *vibhavati* (“flourishes”), which should have ended the composition, is further qualified by the unnecessary adjective *adbhuta-guṇā* (“endowed with wonderful qualities”). The fifth fault is *bhagna-krama,* which means “broken order.” In the first, third and fourth lines there is *anuprāsa,* or alliteration, created by the sounds *ta, ra* and *bha,* but in the second line there is no such *anuprāsa,* and therefore the order is broken.

### Translation

**“In this birth of the Ganges by the inconceivable potency of the Lord, there is no contradiction although it appears contradictory.**

### Purport

The central point of all Vaiṣṇava philosophy is to accept the inconceivable potency of Lord Viṣṇu. What sometimes appears contradictory from a material viewpoint is understandable in connection with the Supreme Personality of Godhead because He can perform contradictory activities by dint of His inconceivable potencies. Modern scientists are puzzled. They cannot even explain how such a large quantity of chemicals has formed the atmosphere. Scientists explain that water is a combination of hydrogen and oxygen, but when asked where such a large quantity of hydrogen and oxygen came from and how they combined to manufacture the great oceans and seas, they cannot answer because they are atheists who will not accept that everything comes from life. Their thesis is that life comes from matter.

Where do all these chemicals come from? The answer is that they are produced by the inconceivable energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Living entities are part of the Supreme Godhead, and from their bodies come many chemicals. For example, the lemon tree is a living entity that produces many lemons, and within each lemon is a great deal of citric acid. Therefore, if even an insignificant living entity who is but a part of the Supreme Lord can produce so much of a chemical, how much potency there must be in the body of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

Scientists cannot perfectly explain where the chemicals of the world are manufactured, but one can explain this perfectly by accepting the inconceivable energy of the Supreme Lord. There is no reason for denying this argument. Since there are potencies in the living entities who are samples of the Personality of Godhead, how much potency there must be in the Supreme Godhead Himself. As described in the *Vedas, nityo nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānām:* “He is the chief eternal of all eternals and the chief living entity among all living entities.” (*Kaṭha Upaniṣad,* 2.2.13)

Unfortunately, atheistic science will not accept that matter comes from life. Scientists insist upon their most illogical and foolish theory that life comes from matter, although this is quite impossible. They cannot prove in their laboratories that matter can produce life, yet there are thousands and thousands of examples illustrating that matter comes from life. Therefore in *Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta* Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī says that as soon as one accepts the inconceivable potency of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, no great philosopher or scientist can put forward any thesis to contradict the Lord’s power. This is expressed in the following Sanskrit verse.

### Purport

In the *Bhagavad-gītā* it is clearly said that all intelligence comes from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is situated in everyone’s heart as the Paramātmā. The Paramātmā gave the *paṇḍita* the intelligence to understand that because he was proud of his learning and wanted to defeat even the Supreme Lord, by the will of the Lord and through the agency of mother Sarasvatī he had been defeated. One should not, therefore, be too proud of one’s position. Even if one is a greatly learned scholar, if he commits an offense to the lotus feet of the Lord he will not be able to speak properly, in spite of his learning. In every respect, we are controlled. Our only duty, therefore, is to surrender always to the lotus feet of the Lord and not be falsely proud. Mother Sarasvatī created this situation to favor the champion *paṇḍita* so that he might surrender unto Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

### Purport

In *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (1.5.11) it is said:

*tad-vāg-visargo janatāgha-viplavo *
 *yasmin prati-ślokam abaddhavaty api  
nāmāny anantasya yaśo ’ṅkitāni yat *
 *śṛṇvanti gāyanti gṛṇanti sādhavaḥ*

“In explaining the glories of the Lord, inexperienced men may compose poetry with many faults, but because it contains glorification of the Lord, great personalities read it, hear it and chant it.” Despite its minute literary discrepancies, one must study poetry on the merit of its subject matter. According to Vaiṣṇava philosophy, any literature that glorifies the Lord, whether properly written or not, is first class. There need be no other considerations. The poetic compositions of Bhavabhūti, or Śrīkaṇṭha, include *Mālatī-mādhava, Uttara-carita, Vīra-carita* and many similar Sanskrit dramas. This great poet was born during the time of Bhojarāja as the son of Nīlakaṇṭha, a *brāhmaṇa.* Kālidāsa flourished during the time of Mahārāja Vikramāditya, and he became the state poet. He composed some thirty or forty Sanskrit dramas, including *Kumāra-sambhava, Abhijñāna-śakuntalā* and *Megha-dūta.* His drama *Raghu-vaṁśa* is especially famous. We have already described Jayadeva in chapter thirteen of the *Ādi-līlā.*

The champion surrendered unto the Lord, and the Lord favored him. One who is favored by the Lord is freed from material bondage, as stated in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (4.9): *tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti so ’rjuna.*

### Synonyms

*bhāgyavanta* — very fortunate; *dig*-*vijayī* — the poetic champion; *sa*-*phala* — successful; *jīvana* — life; *vidyā*-*bale* — by the strength of learning; *pāila* — got; *mahā*-*prabhura* — of Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu; *caraṇa* — lotus feet.

### Translation

**The poetic champion was certainly most fortunate. His life was successful by dint of his vast learning and erudite scholarship, and thus he attained the shelter of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu.**

### Purport

Śrī Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura has sung that the best qualification for taking shelter of the lotus feet of Lord Caitanya is to be the most fallen because the Lord came specifically to deliver the fallen souls. In this age there are very few scholars. Almost everyone is a fallen meat-eater, drunkard, woman-hunter or gambler. Such persons are never considered learned scholars, even if they pose as such. Because these so-called scholars superficially see that Caitanya Mahāprabhu associates with the fallen souls, they think that He is meant for a lower class of men but that they do not need Him. Thus such scholars do not take to the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. To be puffed up with false learning, therefore, is a disqualification for accepting the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. But here is a special example, for although the poetic champion was a greatly learned scholar, the Lord also favored him because of his humble submission.
