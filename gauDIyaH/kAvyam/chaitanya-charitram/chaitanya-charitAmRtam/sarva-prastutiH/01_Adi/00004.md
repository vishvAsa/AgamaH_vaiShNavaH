CHAPTER THREE

In this chapter the author has fully discussed the external reasons for the descent of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, after displaying His pastimes as Lord Kṛṣṇa, thought it wise to make His advent in the form of a devotee to explain personally the transcendental mellows of reciprocal service and love exchanged between Himself and His servants, friends, parents and fiancées. According to the Vedic literature, the foremost occupational duty for humanity in this Age of Kali is *nāma-saṅkīrtana,* or congregational chanting of the holy name of the Lord. The incarnation for this age especially preaches this process, but only Kṛṣṇa Himself can explain the confidential loving service performed in the four principal varieties of loving affairs between the Supreme Lord and His devotees. Lord Kṛṣṇa therefore personally appeared, with His plenary portions, as Lord Caitanya. As stated in this chapter, it was for this purpose that Lord Kṛṣṇa appeared personally in Navadvīpa in the form of Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja has herein presented much authentic evidence from *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* and other scriptures to substantiate the identity of Lord Caitanya with Śrī Kṛṣṇa Himself. He has described bodily symptoms in Lord Caitanya that are visible only in the person of the Supreme Lord, and he has proved that Lord Caitanya appeared with His personal associates — Śrī Nityānanda, Advaita, Gadādhara, Śrīvāsa and other devotees — to preach the special significance of chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. The appearance of Lord Caitanya is both significant and confidential. He can be appreciated only by pure devotees and only through the process of devotional service. The Lord tried to conceal His identity as the Supreme Personality of Godhead by representing Himself as a devotee, but His pure devotees could recognize Him by His special features. The *Vedas* and *Purāṇas* foretell the appearance of Lord Caitanya, but still He is sometimes called, significantly, the concealed descent of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

Advaita Ācārya was a contemporary of Lord Caitanya’s father. He felt sorry for the condition of the world because even after Lord Kṛṣṇa’s appearance, no one had interest in devotional service to Kṛṣṇa. This forgetfulness was so overwhelming that Advaita Prabhu was convinced that no one but Lord Kṛṣṇa Himself could enlighten people about devotional service to the Supreme Lord. Therefore Advaita requested Lord Kṛṣṇa to appear as Lord Caitanya. Offering *tulasī* leaves and Ganges water, He cried for the Lord’s appearance. The Lord, being satisfied by His pure devotees, descends to satisfy them. As such, being pleased by Advaita Ācārya, Lord Caitanya appeared.

In the previous chapter it has been established that Kṛṣṇa, the son of Vrajendra (the King of Vraja), is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, with six opulences. He eternally enjoys transcendentally variegated opulences on His planet, which is known as Goloka. The eternal pastimes of the Lord in the spiritual planet Kṛṣṇaloka are called *aprakaṭa,* or unmanifested, pastimes because they are beyond the purview of the conditioned souls. Lord Kṛṣṇa is always present everywhere, but when He is not present before our eyes, He is said to be *aprakaṭa,* or unmanifested.

A *manv-antara* is the period controlled by one Manu. The reign of fourteen Manus equals the length of one day (twelve hours) in the life of Brahmā, and the night of Brahmā is of the same duration. These calculations are given in the authentic astronomy book known as the *Sūrya-siddhānta.* An annotated Bengali translation of this book was compiled by the great professor of astronomy and mathematics Bimal Prasād Datta, later known as Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Gosvāmī, who was our merciful spiritual master. He was honored with the title Siddhānta Sarasvatī for translating the *Sūrya-siddhānta,* and the title Gosvāmī Mahārāja was added when he accepted *sannyāsa,* the renounced order of life.

### Purport

Now is the term of Vaivasvata Manu, during which Lord Caitanya appears. First Lord Kṛṣṇa appears at the close of the Dvāpara-yuga of the twenty-eighth *divya-yuga,* and then Lord Caitanya appears in the Kali-yuga of the same *divya-yuga.* Lord Kṛṣṇa and Lord Caitanya appear once in each day of Brahmā, or once in fourteen *manv-antaras,* each of seventy-one *divya-yugas* in duration.

From the beginning of Brahmā’s day of 4,320,000,000 years, six Manus appear and disappear before Lord Kṛṣṇa appears. Thus 1,975,320,000 years of the day of Brahmā elapse before the appearance of Lord Kṛṣṇa. This is an astronomical calculation according to solar years.

### Bengali

दास्य, सख्य, वात्सल्य, शृङ्गार—चारि रस ।  
चारि भावेर भक्त यत कृष्ण तार वश ॥ ११ ॥

### Verse text

*dāsya, sakhya, vātsalya, śṛṅgāra — cāri rasa  
cāri bhāvera bhakta yata kṛṣṇa tāra vaśa*

### Synonyms

*dāsya* — servitude; *sakhya* — friendship; *vātsalya* — parental affection; *śṛṅgāra* — conjugal love; *cāri* — four; *rasa* — mellows; *cāri* — four; *bhāvera* — of the sentiments; *bhakta* — devotees; *yata* — as many as there are; *kṛṣṇa* — Lord Kṛṣṇa; *tāra* — by them; *vaśa* — subdued.

### Translation

**Servitude \[dāsya\], friendship \[sakhya\], parental affection \[vātsalya\] and conjugal love \[śṛṅgāra\] are the four transcendental mellows \[rasas\]. By the devotees who cherish these four mellows, Lord Kṛṣṇa is subdued.**

### Purport

*Dāsya, sakhya, vātsalya* and *śṛṅgāra* are the transcendental modes of loving service to the Lord. *Śānta-rasa,* or the neutral stage, is not mentioned in this verse because although in *śānta-rasa* one considers the Absolute Truth the sublime great, one does not go beyond that conception. *Śānta-rasa* is a very grand idea for materialistic philosophers, but such idealistic appreciation is only the beginning; it is the lowest among the relationships in the spiritual world. *Śānta-rasa* is not given much importance because as soon as there is a slight understanding between the knower and the known, active loving transcendental reciprocations and exchanges begin. *Dāsya-rasa* is the basic relationship between Kṛṣṇa and His devotees; therefore this verse considers *dāsya* the first stage of transcendental devotional service.

दास–सखा–पितामाता–कान्तागण लञा ।  
व्रजे क्रीड़ा करे कृष्ण प्रेमाविष्ट हञा ॥ १२ ॥

### Verse text

*dāsa-sakhā-pitā-mātā-kāntā-gaṇa lañā  
vraje krīḍā kare kṛṣṇa premāviṣṭa hañā*

### Synonyms

*dāsa* — servants; *sakhā* — friends; *pitā*-*mātā* — father and mother; *kāntā*-*gaṇa* — lovers; *lañā* — taking; *vraje* — in Vraja; *krīḍā* *kare* — plays; *kṛṣṇa* — Lord Kṛṣṇa; *prema*-*āviṣṭa* — absorbed in love; *hañā* — being.

### Translation

**Absorbed in such transcendental love, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa enjoys in Vraja with His devoted servants, friends, parents and conjugal lovers.**

### Purport

The descent of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the Absolute Personality of Godhead, is very purposeful. In the *Bhagavad-gītā* it is said that one who knows the truth about Śrī Kṛṣṇa’s descent and His various activities is at once liberated and does not have to fall again to this existence of birth and death after he leaves his present material body. In other words, one who factually understands Kṛṣṇa makes his life perfect. Imperfect life is realized in material existence, in five different relationships we share with everyone within the material world: neutrality, servitorship, friendship, parental love and amorous love between husband and wife or lover and beloved. These five enjoyable relationships within the material world are perverted reflections of relationships with the Absolute Personality of Godhead in the transcendental nature. That Absolute Personality, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, descends to revive the five eternally existing relationships. Thus He manifests His transcendental pastimes in Vraja so that people may be attracted into that sphere of activities and leave aside their imitation relationships with the mundane. Then, after fully exhibiting all such activities, the Lord disappears.

### Translation

**Lord Kṛṣṇa enjoys His transcendental pastimes as long as He wishes, and then He disappears. After disappearing, however, He thinks thus:**

bhakti vinā jagatera nāhi avasthāna*

### Synonyms

*cira*-*kāla* — for a long time; *nāhi* *kari* — I have not done; *prema*-*bhakti* — loving devotional service; *dāna* — giving; *bhakti* — devotional service; *vinā* — without; *jagatera* — of the universe; *nāhi* — not; *avasthāna* — existence.

### Translation

**“For a long time I have not bestowed unalloyed loving service to Me upon the inhabitants of the world. Without such loving attachment, the existence of the material world is useless.**

### Purport

The Lord seldom awards pure transcendental love, but without such pure love of God, freed from fruitive activities and empiric speculation, one cannot attain perfection in life.

### Translation

**“Everywhere in the world people worship Me according to scriptural injunctions. But simply by following such regulative principles one cannot attain the loving sentiments of the devotees in Vrajabhūmi.**

### Bengali

ऐश्वर्यज्ञानेते सव जगत् मिश्रित ।

### Verse text

*aiśvarya-jñānete saba jagat miśrita  
aiśvarya-śithila-preme nāhi mora prīta*

### Synonyms

*aiśvarya*-*jñānete* — with knowledge of the opulences; *saba* — all; *jagat* — the world; *miśrita* — mixed; *aiśvarya*-*śithila*-*preme* — to love enfeebled by opulence; *nāhi* — there is not; *mora* — My; *prīta* — attraction.

### Translation

**“Knowing My opulences, the whole world looks upon Me with awe and veneration. But devotion made feeble by such reverence does not attract Me.**

### Purport

After His appearance, Lord Kṛṣṇa thought that He had not distributed the transcendental personal dealings with His devotees in *dāsya, sakhya, vātsalya* and *mādhurya.* One may understand the science of the Supreme Personality of Godhead from the Vedic literatures and thus become a devotee of the Lord and worship Him within the regulative principles described in the scriptures, but one will not know in this way how Kṛṣṇa is served by the residents of Vrajabhūmi. One cannot understand the dealings of the Lord in Vṛndāvana simply by executing the ritualistic regulative principles mentioned in the scriptures. By following scriptural injunctions one may enhance his appreciation for the glories of the Lord, but there is no chance for one to enter into personal dealings with Him. Giving too much attention to understanding the exalted glories of the Lord reduces the chance of one’s entering into personal loving affairs with the Lord. To teach the principles of such loving dealings, the Lord decided to appear as Lord Caitanya.

### Translation

**“By performing such regulated devotional service in awe and veneration, one may go to Vaikuṇṭha and attain the four kinds of liberation.**

सार्ष्टि, सारूप्य, आर सामीप्य, सालोक्य ।

### Verse text

*sārṣṭi, sārūpya, āra sāmīpya, sālokya  
sāyujya nā laya bhakta yāte brahma-aikya*

### Synonyms

*sārṣṭi* — opulences equal with the Lord’s; *sārūpya* — the same form as the Lord’s; *āra* — and; *sāmīpya* — personal association with the Lord; *sālokya* — residence on a Vaikuṇṭha planet; *sāyujya* — oneness with the Lord; *nā* *laya* — they do not accept; *bhakta* — devotees; *yāte* — since; *brahma*-*aikya* — oneness with Brahman.

### Translation

**“These liberations are sārṣṭi \[achieving opulences equal to those of the Lord\], sārūpya \[having a form the same as the Lord’s\], sāmīpya \[living as a personal associate of the Lord\] and sālokya \[living on a Vaikuṇṭha planet\]. Devotees never accept sāyujya, however, since that is oneness with Brahman.**

### Purport

Those engaged in devotional service according to the ritualistic principles mentioned in the scriptures attain these different kinds of liberation. But although such devotees can attain *sārṣṭi, sārūpya, sāmīpya* and *sālokya,* they are not concerned with these liberations, for such devotees are satisfied only in rendering transcendental loving service to the Lord. The fifth kind of liberation, *sāyujya,* is never accepted even by devotees who perform only ritualistic worship. To attain *sāyujya,* or merging into the Brahman effulgence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the aspiration of the impersonalists. A devotee never cares for *sāyujya* liberation.

### Synonyms

### Translation

**“I shall personally inaugurate the religion of the age — nāma-saṅkīrtana, the congregational chanting of the holy name. I shall make the world dance in ecstasy, realizing the four mellows of loving devotional service.**

### Bengali

आपनि करिमु भक्तभाव अङ्गीकारे ।  
आपनि आचरि’ भक्ति शिखाइमु सवारे ॥ २० ॥

### Verse text

*āpani karimu bhakta-bhāva aṅgīkāre  
āpani ācari’ bhakti śikhāimu sabāre*

### Synonyms

*āpani* — personally; *karimu* — I shall make; *bhakta*-*bhāva* — the position of a devotee; *aṅgīkāre* — acceptance; *āpani* — personally; *ācari’* — practicing; *bhakti* — devotional service; *śikhāimu* — I shall teach; *sabāre* — to all.

### Translation

**“I shall accept the role of a devotee, and I shall teach devotional service by practicing it Myself.**

### Purport

When one associates with a pure devotee, he becomes so elevated that he does not aspire even for *sārṣṭi, sārūpya, sāmīpya* or *sālokya,* because he feels that such liberation is a kind of sense gratification. Pure devotees do not ask anything from the Lord for their personal benefit. Even if offered personal benefits, pure devotees do not accept them, because their only desire is to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead by transcendental loving service. No one but the Lord Himself can teach this highest form of devotional service. Therefore, when the Lord took the place of the incarnation of Kali-yuga to spread the glories of chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa — the system of worship recommended in this age — He also distributed the process of devotional service performed on the platform of transcendental spontaneous love. To teach the highest principles of spiritual life, the Lord Himself appeared as a devotee in the form of Lord Caitanya.

### Translation

**In His later pastimes He is known as Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya. He blesses the whole world by teaching about the name and fame of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa.**

### Purport

Lord Caitanya remained a householder only until His twenty-fourth year had passed. Then He entered the renounced order and remained manifest in this material world until His forty-eighth year. Therefore His *śeṣa-līlā,* or the final portion of His activities, lasted twenty-four years.

Some so-called Vaiṣṇavas say that the renounced order of life was not accepted in the Vaiṣṇava *sampradāya,* or disciplic succession, until Lord Caitanya. This is not a very intelligent proposition. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu took the *sannyāsa* order from Śrīpāda Keśava Bhāratī, who belonged to the Śaṅkara sect, which approves of only ten names for *sannyāsīs.* Long before the advent of Śrīpāda Śaṅkarācārya, however, the *sannyāsa* order existed in the Vaiṣṇava line of Viṣṇu Svāmī. In the Viṣṇu Svāmī Vaiṣṇava *sampradāya,* there are ten different kinds of *sannyāsa* names and 108 different names for *sannyāsīs* who accept the *tri-daṇḍa,* the triple staff of *sannyāsa.* This is approved by the Vedic rules. Therefore Vaiṣṇava *sannyāsa* was existent even before the appearance of Śaṅkarācārya, although those who know nothing about Vaiṣṇava *sannyāsa* unnecessarily declare that there is no *sannyāsa* in the Vaiṣṇava *sampradāya.*

During the time of Lord Caitanya, the influence of Śaṅkarācārya in society was very strong. People thought that one could accept *sannyāsa* only in the disciplic succession of Śaṅkarācārya. Lord Caitanya could have performed His missionary activities as a householder, but He found householder life an obstruction to His mission. Therefore He decided to accept the renounced order, *sannyāsa.* Since His acceptance of *sannyāsa* was also designed to attract public attention, Lord Caitanya, not wishing to disturb the social convention, took the renounced order of life from a *sannyāsī* in the disciplic succession of Śaṅkarācārya, although *sannyāsa* was also sanctioned in the Vaiṣṇava *sampradāya.*

In the Śaṅkara-sampradāya there are ten different names awarded to *sannyāsīs:* (1) Tīrtha, (2) Āśrama, (3) Vana, (4) Araṇya, (5) Giri, (6) Parvata, (7) Sāgara, (8) Sarasvatī, (9) Bhāratī and (10) Purī. Before one enters *sannyāsa,* he has one of the various names for a *brahmacārī,* the assistant to a *sannyāsī. Sannyāsīs* with the titles Tīrtha and Āśrama generally stay at Dvārakā, and their *brahmacārī* name is Svarūpa. Those known by the names Vana and Araṇya stay at Puruṣottama, or Jagannātha Purī, and their *brahmacārī* name is Prakāśa. Those with the names Giri, Parvata and Sāgara generally stay at Badarikāśrama, and their *brahmacārī* name is Ānanda. Those with the titles Sarasvatī, Bhāratī and Purī usually live at Śṛṅgerī in South India, and their *brahmacārī* name is Caitanya.

Śrīpāda Śaṅkarācārya established four monasteries in India, in the four directions (north, south, east and west), and he entrusted them to four *sannyāsīs* who were his disciples. Now there are hundreds of branch monasteries under these four principal monasteries, and although there is an official symmetry among them, there are many differences in their dealings. The four different sects of these monasteries are known as Ānandavāra, Bhogavāra, Kīṭavāra and Bhūmivāra, and in course of time they have developed different ideas and different slogans.

According to the regulation of the disciplic succession, one who wishes to enter the renounced order in Śaṅkara’s sect must first be trained as a *brahmacārī* under a bona fide *sannyāsī,* The *brahmacārī’s* name is ascertained according to the group to which the *sannyāsī* belongs. Lord Caitanya accepted *sannyāsa* from Keśava Bhāratī. When He first approached Keśava Bhāratī, He was accepted as a *brahmacārī* with the name Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya Brahmacārī. After He took *sannyāsa,* He preferred to keep the name Kṛṣṇa Caitanya.

The great authorities in the disciplic succession had not offered to explain why Lord Caitanya refused to take the name Bhāratī after He took *sannyāsa* from a Bhāratī, until Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Gosvāmī Mahārāja volunteered the explanation that because a *sannyāsī* in the Śaṅkara-sampradāya thinks that he has become the Supreme, Lord Caitanya, wanting to avoid such a misconception, kept the name Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya, placing Himself as an eternal servitor. A *brahmacārī* is supposed to serve the spiritual master; therefore He did not negate that relationship of servitude to His spiritual master. Accepting such a position is favorable for the relationship between the disciple and the spiritual master.

The authentic biographies also mention that Lord Caitanya accepted the *daṇḍa* (rod) and begging pot, symbolic of the *sannyāsa* order, at the time He took *sannyāsa.*

### Purport

In this Age of Kali the practical system of religion for everyone is the chanting of the name of Godhead. This was introduced in this age by Lord Caitanya. *Bhakti-yoga* actually begins with the chanting of the holy name, as confirmed by Madhvācārya in his commentary on the *Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad.* He quotes this verse from the *Nārāyaṇa-saṁhitā:*

*dvāparīyair janair viṣṇuḥ* *pañcarātrais tu kevalaiḥ  
kalau tu nāma-mātreṇa* *pūjyate bhagavān hariḥ*

“In the Dvāpara-yuga people should worship Lord Viṣṇu only by the regulative principles of the *Nārada-pañcarātra* and other such authorized books. In the Age of Kali, however, people should simply chant the holy names of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.” The Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra* is specifically mentioned in many *Upaniṣads,* such as the *Kali-santaraṇa Upaniṣad,* where it is said:

*hare kṛṣṇa hare kṛṣṇa* *kṛṣṇa kṛṣṇa hare hare  
hare rāma hare rāma* *rāma rāma hare hare*

*iti ṣoḍaśakaṁ nāmnāṁ* *kali-kalmaṣa-nāśanaṁ  
nātaḥ parataropāyaḥ* *sarva-vedeṣu dṛśyate*

“After searching through all the Vedic literature, one cannot find a method of religion more sublime for this age than the chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa.”

### Purport

This is a verse from the *Mahābhārata* (*Dāna-dharma, Viṣṇu-sahasra-nāma-stotra*)*.* In his commentary on the *Viṣṇu-sahasra-nāma,* called the *Nāmārtha-sudhā,* Śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa, commenting upon this verse, asserts that Lord Caitanya is the Supreme Personality of Godhead according to the evidence of the *Upaniṣads.* He explains that *suvarṇa-varṇaḥ* means a golden complexion. He also quotes the Vedic injunction *yadā paśyaḥ paśyate rukma-varṇaṁ kartāram īśaṁ puruṣaṁ brahma-yonim* (*Muṇḍaka Up.* 3.1.3)*. Rukma-varṇaṁ kartāram īśam* refers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead as having a complexion the color of molten gold. *Puruṣam* means the Supreme Lord, and *brahma-yonim* indicates that He is also the Supreme Brahman. This evidence, too, proves that Lord Caitanya is the Supreme Personality of Godhead Kṛṣṇa. Another meaning of the description of the Lord as having a golden hue is that Lord Caitanya’s personality is as fascinating as gold is attractive. Śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa has explained that the word *varāṅga* means “exquisitely beautiful.”

Lord Caitanya accepted *sannyāsa,* leaving aside His householder life, to preach His mission. He has equanimity in different senses. First, He describes the confidential truth of the Personality of Godhead, and second, He satisfies everyone by knowledge and attachment to Kṛṣṇa. He is peaceful because He renounces all topics not related to the service of Kṛṣṇa. Śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa has explained that the word *niṣṭhā* indicates His being rigidly fixed in chanting the holy name of Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Lord Caitanya subdued all disturbing opponents of devotional service, especially the monists, who are actually averse to the personal feature of the Supreme Lord.

### Purport

This text is from *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (11.5.32). Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī has explained this verse in his commentary on the *Bhāgavatam,* known as the *Krama-sandarbha,* wherein he says that Lord Kṛṣṇa also appears with a golden complexion. That golden Lord Kṛṣṇa is Lord Caitanya, who is worshiped by intelligent men in this age. That is confirmed in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* by Garga Muni, who said that although the child Kṛṣṇa was blackish, He also appears in three other colors — red, white and yellow. He exhibited His white and red complexions in the Satya and Tretā ages respectively. He did not exhibit the remaining color, yellow-gold, until He appeared as Lord Caitanya, who is known as Gaura Hari.

Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī explains that *kṛṣṇa-varṇam* means Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya. *Kṛṣṇa-varṇa* and Kṛṣṇa Caitanya are equivalent. The name Kṛṣṇa appears with both Lord Kṛṣṇa and Lord Caitanya Kṛṣṇa. Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but He always engages in describing Kṛṣṇa and thus enjoys transcendental bliss by chanting and remembering His name and form. Lord Kṛṣṇa Himself appears as Lord Caitanya to preach the highest gospel.

Lord Caitanya always chants the holy name of Kṛṣṇa and describes it also, and because He is Kṛṣṇa Himself, whoever meets Him will automatically chant the holy name of Kṛṣṇa and later describe it to others. He injects one with transcendental Kṛṣṇa consciousness, which merges the chanter in transcendental bliss. In all respects, therefore, He appears before everyone as Kṛṣṇa, either by personality or by sound. Simply by seeing Lord Caitanya one at once remembers Lord Kṛṣṇa. One may therefore accept Him as *viṣṇu-tattva.* In other words, Lord Caitanya is Lord Kṛṣṇa Himself.

*Sāṅgopāṅgāstra-pārṣadam* further indicates that Lord Caitanya is Lord Kṛṣṇa. His body is always decorated with ornaments of sandalwood and with sandalwood paste. By His superexcellent beauty He subdues all the people of the age. In other descents the Lord sometimes used weapons to defeat the demoniac, but in this age the Lord subdues them with His all-attractive figure as Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī explains that His beauty is His *astra,* or weapon, to subdue the demons. Because He is all-attractive, it is to be understood that all the demigods lived with Him as His companions. His acts were uncommon and His associates wonderful. When He propagated the *saṅkīrtana* movement, He attracted many great scholars and *ācāryas,* especially in Bengal and Orissa. Lord Caitanya is always accompanied by His best associates like Lord Nityānanda, Advaita, Gadādhara and Śrīvāsa.

Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī cites a verse from the Vedic literature which says that there is no necessity of performing sacrificial demonstrations or ceremonial functions. He comments that instead of engaging in such external, pompous exhibitions, all people, regardless of caste, color or creed, can assemble together and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa to worship Lord Caitanya. *Kṛṣṇa-varṇaṁ tviṣākṛṣṇam* indicates that prominence should be given to the name of Kṛṣṇa. Lord Caitanya taught Kṛṣṇa consciousness and chanted the name of Kṛṣṇa. Therefore, to worship Lord Caitanya, everyone should together chant the *mahā-mantra* — Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare. To propagate worship in churches, temples or mosques is not possible, because people have lost interest in that. But anywhere and everywhere, people can chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. Thus worshiping Lord Caitanya, they can perform the highest activity and fulfill the highest religious purpose of satisfying the Supreme Lord.

Śrīla Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya, a famous disciple of Lord Caitanya, said, “The principle of transcendental devotional service having been lost, Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya has appeared in order to deliver again the process of devotion. He is so kind that He is distributing love of Kṛṣṇa. Everyone should be attracted more and more to His lotus feet, as humming bees are attracted to a lotus flower.”

### Translation

**The word “aṅga” indeed refers to plenary portions. Such manifestations should never be considered products of material nature, for they are all transcendental, full of knowledge and full of bliss.**

### Purport

In the material world, if a fragment is taken from an original object, the original object is reduced by the removal of that fragment. But the Supreme Personality of Godhead is not at all affected by the actions of *māyā.* The *Īśopaniṣad* says:

*oṁ pūrṇam adaḥ pūrṇam idaṁ* *pūrṇāt pūrṇam udacyate  
pūrṇasya pūrṇam ādāya* *pūrṇam evāvaśiṣyate*

“The Personality of Godhead is perfect and complete, and because He is completely perfect, all emanations from Him, such as this phenomenal world, are perfectly equipped as complete wholes. Whatever is produced of the complete whole is also complete in itself. Because He is the complete whole, even though so many complete units emanate from Him, He remains the complete balance.” (*Śrī Īśopaniṣad,* Invocation)

In the realm of the Absolute, one plus one equals one, and one minus one equals one. Therefore one should not conceive of a fragment of the Supreme Lord in the material sense. In the spiritual world there is no influence of the material energy or material calculations of fragments. In the fifteenth chapter of the *Bhagavad-gītā,* the Lord says that the living entities are His parts and parcels. There are innumerable living entities throughout the material and spiritual universes, but still Lord Kṛṣṇa is full in Himself. To think that God has lost His personality because His many parts and parcels are distributed all over the universe is an illusion. That is a material calculation. Such calculations are possible only under the influence of the material energy, *māyā.* In the spiritual world the material energy is conspicuous only by its absence.

In the category of *viṣṇu-tattva* there is no loss of power from one expansion to the next, any more than there is a loss of illumination as one candle kindles another. Thousands of candles may be kindled by an original candle, and all will have the same candle power. In this way it is to be understood that although all the *viṣṇu-tattvas,* from Kṛṣṇa and Lord Caitanya to Rāma, Nṛsiṁha, Varāha and so on, appear with different features in different ages, all are equally invested with supreme potency.

Demigods such as Lord Brahmā and Lord Śiva come in contact with the material energy, and their power and potency are therefore of different gradations. All the incarnations of Viṣṇu, however, are equal in potency, for the influence of *māyā* cannot even approach Them.

### Translation

**Thus the Lord is equipped with sharp weapons in the form of His parts and plenary portions. All these weapons are competent enough to crush the faithless atheists.**

### Purport

The word *pāṣaṇḍa* is very significant here. One who compares the Supreme Personality of Godhead to the demigods is known as a *pāṣaṇḍa. Pāṣaṇḍas* try to bring the Supreme Lord down to a mundane level. Sometimes they create their own imaginary God or accept an ordinary person as God and advertise him as equal to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. They are so foolish that they present someone as the next incarnation of Lord Caitanya or Kṛṣṇa although his activities are all contradictory to those of a genuine incarnation, and thus they fool the innocent public. One who is intelligent and who studies the characteristics of the Supreme Personality of Godhead with reference to the Vedic context cannot be bewildered by the *pāṣaṇḍas.*

*Pāṣaṇḍas,* or atheists, cannot understand the pastimes of the Supreme Lord or transcendental loving service to the Lord. They think that devotional service is no better than ordinary fruitive activities (*karma*)*.* As the *Bhagavad-gītā* (4.8) confirms, however, the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His devotees, saving the righteous and chastising the miscreants (*paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ vināśāya ca duṣkṛtām*), always curb these nonsensical atheists. Miscreants always want to deny the Supreme Personality of Godhead and put stumbling blocks in the path of devotional service. The Lord sends His bona fide representatives and appears Himself to curb this nonsense.

### Translation

**One who says that ten million aśvamedha sacrifices are equal to the chanting of the holy name of Lord Kṛṣṇa is undoubtedly an atheist. He is sure to be punished by Yamarāja.**

### Purport

In the list of the ten kinds of offenses in chanting the holy name of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hare Kṛṣṇa, the eighth offense is *dharma-vrata-tyāga-hutādi-sarva-śubha-kriyā-sāmyam api pramādaḥ.* One should never consider the chanting of the holy name of Godhead equal to pious activities like giving charity to *brāhmaṇas* or saintly persons, opening charitable educational institutions, distributing free food and so on. The results of pious activities do not equal the results of chanting the holy name of Kṛṣṇa.

The Vedic scriptures say:

*go-koṭi-dānaṁ grahaṇe khagasya *
 *prayāga-gaṅgodaka-kalpa-vāsaḥ  
yajñāyutaṁ meru-suvarṇa-dānaṁ *
 *govinda-kīrter na samaṁ śatāṁśaiḥ*

“Even if one distributes ten million cows in charity during an eclipse of the sun, lives at the confluence of the Ganges and Yamunā for millions of years, or gives a mountain of gold in sacrifice to the *brāhmaṇas,* he does not earn one hundredth part of the merit derived from chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa.” In other words, one who accepts the chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa to be some kind of pious activity is completely misled. Of course, it is pious; but the real fact is that Kṛṣṇa and His name, being transcendental, are far above all mundane pious activity. Pious activity is on the material platform, but chanting of the holy name of Kṛṣṇa is completely on the spiritual plane. Therefore, although *pāsaṇḍīs* do not understand this, pious activity can never compare to the chanting of the holy name.

### Purport

Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī has placed the verse from *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* quoted in text 52 (*kṛṣṇa-varṇaṁ tviṣākṛṣṇam*) as the auspicious introduction to his *Bhāgavata-sandarbha,* or *Ṣaṭ-sandarbha.* He has composed this text (81), which is, in effect, an explanation of the *Bhāgavatam* verse, as the second verse of the same work. The verse from *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* was enunciated by Karabhājana, one of the nine great sages, and it is elaborately explained by the *Sarva-saṁvādinī,* Jīva Gosvāmī’s commentary on his own *Ṣaṭ-sandarbha.*

*Antaḥ kṛṣṇa* refers to one who is always thinking of Kṛṣṇa. This attitude is a predominant feature of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī. Even though many devotees always think of Kṛṣṇa, none can surpass the *gopīs,* among whom Rādhārāṇī is the leader in thinking of Kṛṣṇa. Rādhārāṇī’s Kṛṣṇa consciousness surpasses that of all other devotees. Lord Caitanya accepted the position of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī to understand Kṛṣṇa; therefore He was always thinking of Kṛṣṇa in the same way as Rādhārāṇī. By thinking of Lord Kṛṣṇa, He always overlapped Kṛṣṇa.

Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya, who was outwardly very fair, with a complexion like molten gold, simultaneously manifested His eternal associates, opulences, expansions and incarnations. He preached the process of chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, and those who are under His lotus feet are glorious.

### Translation

**“O my Lord, those influenced by demoniac principles cannot realize You, although You are clearly the Supreme by dint of Your exalted activities, forms, character and uncommon power, which are confirmed by all the revealed scriptures in the quality of goodness and the celebrated transcendentalists in the divine nature.”**

### Purport

This is a verse from the *Stotra-ratna* (12) of Yāmunācārya, the spiritual master of Rāmānujācārya. The authentic scriptures describe the transcendental activities, features, form and qualities of Kṛṣṇa, and Kṛṣṇa explains Himself in the *Bhagavad-gītā,* the most authentic scripture in the world. He is further explained in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,* which is considered the explanation of the *Vedānta-sūtra.* Lord Kṛṣṇa is accepted as the Supreme Personality of Godhead by these authentic scriptures, not simply by *vox populi.* In the modern age a certain class of fools think that they can vote anyone into the position of God, as they can vote a man into the position of a political executive head. But the transcendental Supreme Personality of Godhead is perfectly described in the authentic scriptures. In the *Bhagavad-gītā* the Lord says that only fools deride Him, thinking that anyone can speak like Kṛṣṇa.

Even according to historical references, Kṛṣṇa’s activities are most uncommon. Kṛṣṇa has affirmed, “I am God,” and He has acted accordingly. Māyāvādīs think that everyone can claim to be God, but that is their illusion, for no one else can perform such extraordinary activities as Kṛṣṇa. When He was a child on the lap of His mother, He killed the demon Pūtanā. Then He killed the demons Tṛṇāvarta, Vatsāsura and Baka. When He was a little more grown up, He killed the demons Aghāsura and Ṛṣabhāsura. Therefore God is God from the very beginning. The idea that someone can become God by meditation is ridiculous. By hard endeavor one may realize his godly nature, but he will never become God. The *asuras,* or demons, who think that anyone can become God, are condemned.

The authentic scriptures are compiled by personalities like Vyāsadeva, Nārada, Asita and Parāśara, who are not ordinary men. All the followers of the Vedic way of life have accepted these famous personalities, whose authentic scriptures conform to the Vedic literature. Nevertheless, the demoniac do not believe their statements, and they purposely oppose the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His devotees. Today it is fashionable for common men to write whimsical words as so-called incarnations of God and be accepted as authentic by other common men. This demoniac mentality is condemned in the seventh chapter of the *Bhagavad-gītā,* wherein it is said that those who are miscreants and the lowest of mankind, who are fools and asses, cannot accept the Supreme Personality of Godhead because of their demoniac nature. They are compared to *ulūkas,* or owls, who cannot open their eyes in the sunlight. Because they cannot bear the sunlight, they hide themselves from it and never see it. They cannot believe that there is such illumination.

### Translation

**“O my Lord, everything within material nature is limited by time, space and thought. Your characteristics, however, being unequaled and unsurpassed, are always transcendental to such limitations. You sometimes cover such characteristics by Your own energy, but nevertheless Your unalloyed devotees are always able to see You under all circumstances.”**

### Purport

This verse is also quoted from the *Stotra-ratna* (13) of Yāmunācārya. Everything covered by the influence of *māyā* is within the limited boundaries of space, time and thought. Even the greatest manifestation we can conceive, the sky, also has limitations. From the authentic scriptures, however, it is evident that beyond the sky is a covering of seven layers, each ten times thicker than the one preceding it. The covering layers are vast, but with or without coverings, space is limited. Our power to think about space and time is also limited. Time is eternal; we may imagine billions and trillions of years, but that will still be an inadequate estimate of the extent of time. Our imperfect senses, therefore, cannot think of the greatness of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, nor can we bring Him within the limitations of time or our thinking power. His position is accordingly described by the word *ullaṅghita.* He is transcendental to space, time and thought; although He appears within them, He exists transcendentally. Even when the Lord’s transcendental existence is disguised by space, time and thought, however, pure devotees of the Supreme Lord can see Him in His personal features beyond space, time and thought. In other words, even though the Lord is not visible to the eyes of ordinary men, those who are beyond the covering layers because of their transcendental devotional service can still see Him.

The sun may appear covered by a cloud, but actually it is the eyes of the tiny people below the cloud that are covered, not the sun. If those tiny people rose above the cloud in an airplane, they could then see the sunshine and the sun without impediment. Similarly, although the covering of *māyā* is very strong, Lord Kṛṣṇa says in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (7.14):

*daivī hy eṣā guṇa-mayī* *mama māyā duratyayā  
mām eva ye prapadyante* *māyām etāṁ taranti te*

“This divine energy of Mine, consisting of the three modes of material nature, is difficult to overcome. But those who have surrendered unto Me can easily cross beyond it.” To surpass the influence of the illusory energy is very difficult, but those who are determined to catch hold of the lotus feet of the Lord are freed from the clutches of *māyā.* Therefore, pure devotees can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but demons, because of their miscreant behavior, cannot understand the Lord, in spite of seeing the many revealed scriptures and the uncommon activities of the Lord.

### Translation

**“There are two classes of men in the created world. One consists of the demoniac and the other of the godly. The devotees of Lord Viṣṇu are the godly, whereas those who are just the opposite are called demons.”**

### Purport

This is a verse from the *Padma Purāṇa. Viṣṇu-bhaktas,* or devotees in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, are known as *devas* (demigods). Atheists, who do not believe in God or who declare themselves God, are *asuras* (demons). *Asuras* always engage in atheistic material activities, exploring ways to utilize the resources of matter to enjoy sense gratification. The *viṣṇu-bhaktas,* Kṛṣṇa conscious devotees, are also active, but their objective is to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead by devotional service. Superficially both classes may appear to work in the same way, but their purposes are completely opposite because of a difference in consciousness. *Asuras* work for personal sense gratification, whereas devotees work for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord. Both work conscientiously, but their motives are different.

The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is meant for *devas,* or devotees. Demons cannot take part in Kṛṣṇa conscious activities, nor can devotees in Kṛṣṇa consciousness take part in demoniac activities or work like cats and dogs simply for sense gratification. Such activity does not appeal to those in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Devotees accept only the bare necessities of life to keep themselves fit to act in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. The balance of their energy is used for developing Kṛṣṇa consciousness, through which one can be transferred to the abode of Kṛṣṇa by always thinking of Him, even at the point of death.

Advaita Ācārya saw the entire world to be engaged in activities of material piety and impiety, without a trace of devotional service, or Kṛṣṇa consciousness, anywhere. The fact is that in this material world there is no scarcity of anything except Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Material necessities are supplied by the mercy of the Supreme Lord. We sometimes feel scarcity because of our mismanagement, but the real problem is that people are out of touch with Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Everyone is engaged in material sense gratification, but people have no plan for making an ultimate solution to their real problems, namely birth, disease, old age and death. These four material miseries are called *bhava-roga,* or material diseases. They can be cured only by Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Therefore Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the greatest benediction for human society.

### Translation

**Seeing the activities of the world, the Ācārya felt compassion and began to ponder how He could act for the people’s benefit.**

### Purport

This sort of serious interest in the welfare of the public makes one a bona fide *ācārya.* An *ācārya* does not exploit his followers. Since the *ācārya* is a confidential servitor of the Lord, his heart is always full of compassion for humanity in its suffering. He knows that all suffering is due to the absence of devotional service to the Lord, and therefore he always tries to find ways to change people’s activities, making them favorable for the attainment of devotion. That is the qualification of an *ācārya.* Although Śrī Advaita Prabhu Himself was powerful enough to do the work, as a submissive servitor He thought that without the personal appearance of the Lord, no one could improve the fallen condition of society.

In the grim clutches of *māyā,* the first-class prisoners of this material world wrongly think themselves happy because they are rich, powerful, resourceful and so on. These foolish creatures do not know that they are nothing but play dolls in the hands of material nature and that at any moment material nature’s pitiless intrigues can crush to dust all their plans for godless activities. Such foolish prisoners cannot see that however they improve their position by artificial means, the calamities of repeated birth, death, disease and old age are always beyond the jurisdiction of their control. Foolish as they are, they neglect these major problems of life and busy themselves with false things that cannot help them solve their real problems. They know that they do not want to suffer death or the pangs of disease and old age, but under the influence of the illusory energy, they are grossly negligent and therefore do nothing to solve the problems. This is called *māyā.* People held in the grip of *māyā* are thrown into oblivion after death, and as a result of their *karma,* in the next life they become dogs or gods, although most of them become dogs. To become gods in the next life, they must engage in the devotional service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; otherwise, they are sure to become dogs or hogs in terms of the laws of nature.

The third-class prisoners, being less materially opulent than the first-class prisoners, endeavor to imitate them, for they also have no information of the real nature of their imprisonment. Thus they also are misled by the illusory material nature. The function of the *ācārya,* however, is to change the activities of both the first-class and third-class prisoners for their real benefit. This endeavor makes him a very dear devotee of the Lord, who says clearly in the *Bhagavad-gītā* that no one in human society is dearer to Him than a devotee who constantly engages in His service by finding ways to preach the message of Godhead for the real benefit of the world. The so-called *ācāryas* of the Age of Kali are more concerned with exploiting the resources of their followers than mitigating their miseries; but Śrī Advaita Prabhu, as an ideal *ācārya,* was concerned with improving the condition of the world situation.

### Translation

**“My name, ‘Advaita,’ will be fitting if I am able to induce Kṛṣṇa to inaugurate the movement of the chanting of the holy name.”**

### Purport

The nondualist Māyāvādī philosopher who falsely believes that he is nondifferent from the Lord is unable to call Him like Advaita Prabhu. Advaita Prabhu is nondifferent from the Lord, yet in His relationship with the Lord He does not merge with Him but eternally renders service unto Him as a plenary portion. This is inconceivable for Māyāvādīs because they think in terms of mundane sense perception and therefore think that nondualism necessitates losing one’s separate identity. It is clear from this verse, however, that Advaita Prabhu, although retaining His separate identity, is nondifferent from the Lord.

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu preached the philosophy of inconceivable, simultaneous oneness with the Lord and difference from Him. Conceivable dualism and monism are conceptions of the imperfect senses, which are unable to reach the Transcendence because the Transcendence is beyond the conception of limited potency. The actions of Śrī Advaita Prabhu, however, give tangible proof of inconceivable nondualism. One who therefore surrenders unto Śrī Advaita Prabhu can easily follow the philosophy of inconceivable simultaneous dualism and monism.

### Purport

Through devotional service one can easily please Lord Kṛṣṇa with a leaf of the *tulasī* plant and a little water. As the Lord says in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (9.26), a leaf, a flower, a fruit or some water (*patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyam*), when offered with devotion, very much pleases Him. He universally accepts the services of His devotees. Even the poorest of devotees in any part of the world can secure a small flower, fruit or leaf and a little water, and if these offerings, and especially *tulasī* leaves and Ganges water, are offered to Kṛṣṇa with devotion, He is very satisfied. It is said that Kṛṣṇa is so much pleased by such devotional service that He offers Himself to His devotee in exchange for it. Śrīla Advaita Ācārya knew this fact, and therefore He decided to call for the Personality of Godhead Kṛṣṇa to descend by worshiping the Lord with *tulasī* leaves and the water of the Ganges.

### Purport

This text from *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (3.9.11) is a prayer by Lord Brahmā to the Supreme Personality of Godhead Kṛṣṇa for His blessings in the work of creation. Knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead can be understood from the descriptions of the Vedic scriptures. For example, the *Brahma-saṁhitā* (5.29) describes that in the abode of Lord Kṛṣṇa, which is made of *cintāmaṇi* (touchstone), the Lord, acting as a cowherd boy, is served by hundreds and thousands of goddesses of fortune. Māyāvādīs think that the devotees have imagined the form of Kṛṣṇa, but the authentic Vedic scriptures have actually described Kṛṣṇa and His various transcendental forms.

The word *śruta* in *śrutekṣita-pathaḥ* refers to the *Vedas,* and *īkṣita* indicates that the way to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead is by proper study of the Vedic scriptures. One cannot imagine something about God or His form. Such imagination is not accepted by those who are serious about enlightenment. Here Brahmā says that one can know Kṛṣṇa through the path of properly understanding the Vedic texts. If by studying the form, name, qualities, pastimes and paraphernalia of the Supreme Godhead one is attracted to the Lord, he can execute devotional service, and the form of the Lord will be impressed in his heart and remain transcendentally situated there. Unless a devotee actually develops transcendental love for the Lord, it is not possible for him to think always of the Lord within his heart. Such constant thought of the Lord is the sublime perfection of the yogic process, as the *Bhagavad-gītā* confirms in the sixth chapter (47), stating that anyone absorbed in such thought is the best of all *yogīs.* Such transcendental absorption is known as *samādhi.* A pure devotee who is always thinking of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the person qualified to see the Lord.

One cannot speak of Urugāya (the Lord, who is glorified by sublime prayers) unless one is transcendentally elevated. The Lord has innumerable forms, as the *Brahma-saṁhitā* confirms (*advaitam acyutam anādim ananta-rūpam*)*.* The Lord expands Himself in innumerable *svāṁśa* forms. When a devotee, hearing about these innumerable forms, becomes attached to one and always thinks of Him, the Lord appears to him in that form. Lord Kṛṣṇa is especially pleasing to such devotees, in whose hearts He is always present because of their highly elevated transcendental love.
