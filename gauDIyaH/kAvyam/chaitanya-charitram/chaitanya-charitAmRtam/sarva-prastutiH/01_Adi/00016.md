CHAPTER FIFTEEN

A synopsis of the fifteenth chapter is as follows. The Lord took lessons in grammar from Gaṅgādāsa Paṇḍita and became very expert in commenting upon grammar. He forbade His mother to take grains on the Ekādaśī day. He narrated a story that Viśvarūpa, after accepting the *sannyāsa* order, invited Him in a dream to accept *sannyāsa* also*,* but the Lord refused and was therefore sent back home. When Jagannātha Miśra passed away, the Lord married the daughter of Vallabhācārya, whose name was Lakṣmī. All these events are summarized in this chapter.

### Verse text

*gaṅgādāsa paṇḍita-sthāne paḍena vyākaraṇa  
śravaṇa-mātre kaṇṭhe kaila sūtra-vṛtti-gaṇa*

### Synonyms

*gaṅgādāsa* — Gaṅgādāsa; *paṇḍita*-*sthāne* — at the place of the teacher; *paḍena* — studies; *vyākaraṇa* — grammar; *śravaṇa*-*mātre* — simply by hearing; *kaṇṭhe* — between the neck and the heart; *kaila* — did; *sūtra*-*vṛtti*-*gaṇa* — the aphorisms and their definitions.

### Translation

**When the Lord was studying grammar at the place of Gaṅgādāsa Paṇḍita, He would immediately learn grammatical rules and definitions by heart simply by hearing them once.**

### Purport

Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura says that the Lord was given lessons by a teacher named Viṣṇu and another teacher named Sudarśana. Later on, when He was a little grown up, He was under the care of Gaṅgādāsa Paṇḍita, who taught Him grammar of a higher standard. Anyone serious about studying the Sanskrit language should first learn grammar. It is said that simply to finish studying Sanskrit grammar takes at least twelve years, but once one learns the grammatical rules and regulations very nicely, all other scriptures or subject matters in Sanskrit are extremely easy to understand, for Sanskrit grammar is the gateway to education.

prabhu kahe, — ekādaśīte anna nā khāibe*

### Translation

### Purport

From the very beginning of His childhood life Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu introduced the system of observing a fast on the Ekādaśī day. In the *Bhakti-sandarbha,* by Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī, there is a quotation from the *Skanda Purāṇa* admonishing that a person who eats grains on Ekādaśī becomes a murderer of his mother, father, brother and spiritual master, and even if he is elevated to a Vaikuṇṭha planet, he falls down. On Ekādaśī, everything is cooked for Viṣṇu, including regular grains and dhal, but it is enjoined that a Vaiṣṇava should not even take *viṣṇu-prasādam* on Ekādaśī. It is said that a Vaiṣṇava does not accept anything eatable that is not offered to Lord Viṣṇu, but on Ekādaśī a Vaiṣṇava should not touch even *mahā-prasādam* offered to Viṣṇu, although such *prasādam* may be kept for being eaten the next day. It is strictly forbidden for one to accept any kind of grain on Ekādaśī, even if it is offered to Lord Viṣṇu.

### Bengali

शची कहे,—ना खाइव, भालइ कहिला ।  
सेइ हैते एकादशी करिते लागिला ॥ १० ॥

### Verse text

*śacī kahe, — nā khāiba, bhāla-i kahilā  
sei haite ekādaśī karite lāgilā*

### Synonyms

*śacī* *kahe* — mother Śacī said; *nā* *khāiba* — I shall not take; *bhāla*-*i* *kahilā* — You have said very nicely; *sei* *haite* — from that day; *ekādaśī* — Ekādaśī day; *karite* *lāgilā* — began to observe.

### Translation

**Mother Śacī said, “You have spoken very nicely. I shall not eat grains on Ekādaśī.” From that day, she began to observe fasting on Ekādaśī.**

### Purport

It is a prejudice among *smārta-brāhmaṇas* that a widow must observe fasting on Ekādaśī but a woman who is *sa-dhava* — who has her husband — should not. It appears that before Lord Caitanya’s request, Śacīmātā, being *sa-dhava,* was not observing Ekādaśī. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, however, introduced the system that a woman, even if not a widow, must observe the Ekādaśī day and must not touch any kind of grains, even those offered to the Deity of Viṣṇu.

## Text 14

### Bengali

भाल हैल,—विश्वरूप सन्न्यास करिल ।  
पितृकुल, मातृकुल,—दुइ उद्धारिल ॥ १४ ॥

### Verse text

*bhāla haila, — viśvarūpa sannyāsa karila  
pitṛ-kula, mātṛ-kula, — dui uddhārila*

### Synonyms

*bhāla* *haila* — it is very good; *viśvarūpa* — Viśvarūpa; *sannyāsa* — the renounced order of life; *karila* — has accepted; *pitṛ*-*kula* — father’s family; *mātṛ*-*kula* — mother’s family; *dui* — both of them; *uddhārila* — delivered.

### Translation

**“My dear mother and father,” the Lord said, “it is very good that Viśvarūpa has accepted the sannyāsa order, for thus He has delivered both His father’s family and His mother’s family.”**

### Purport

It is sometimes said that Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu disapproved of the acceptance of the *sannyāsa* order in this Kali-yuga because in the *śāstra* it is said:

*aśvamedhaṁ gavālambhaṁ* *sannyāsaṁ pala-paitṛkam  
devareṇa sutotpattiṁ* *kalau pañca vivarjayet*

“In this Age of Kali, five acts are forbidden: the offering of a horse in sacrifice, the offering of a cow in sacrifice, the acceptance of the order of *sannyāsa,* the offering of oblations of flesh to the forefathers, and a man’s begetting children in his brother’s wife.” (*Brahma-vaivarta Purāṇa, Kṛṣṇa-janma-khaṇḍa* 185.180)

Nevertheless, we see that Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu Himself accepted *sannyāsa* and approved of the *sannyāsa* of His elder brother, Viśvarūpa. It is clearly said here, *bhāla haila, — viśvarūpa sannyāsa karila/ pitṛ-kula, mātṛ-kula, — dui uddhārila.* Therefore, should it be thought that Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu made statements that are contradictory? No, actually He did not. It is recommended that one accept *sannyāsa* to dedicate his life for the service of the Lord, and everyone must take that kind of *sannyāsa,* for by accepting such *sannyāsa* one renders the best service to both his paternal and maternal families. But one should not accept the *sannyāsa* order of the Māyāvāda school, which has practically no meaning. We find many Māyāvādī *sannyāsīs* simply loitering in the street thinking themselves Brahman or Nārāyaṇa and spending all day and night begging so they can fill their hungry bellies. Māyāvādī *sannyāsīs* have become so degraded that there is a section of them who eat everything, just like hogs and dogs. It is such degraded *sannyāsa* that is prohibited in this age. Actually, Śrīla Śaṅkarācārya’s principles for the acceptance of *sannyāsa* were very strict, but later the so-called Māyāvādī *sannyāsīs* became degraded because of their false philosophy, which propounds that by accepting *sannyāsa* one becomes Nārāyaṇa. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu rejected that kind of *sannyāsa.* But the acceptance of *sannyāsa* is one of the items of the *varṇāśrama-dharma.* How then can it be rejected?

### Verse text

एकदिन नैवेद्य–ताम्वुल खाइय़ा ।

### Verse text

*eka-dina naivedya-tāmbūla khāiyā  
bhūmite paḍilā prabhu acetana hañā*

### Synonyms

*eka*-*dina* — one day; *naivedya* — food offered to the Deity; *tāmbūla* — betel nut; *khāiyā* — after eating; *bhūmite* — on the ground; *paḍilā* — fell; *prabhu* — the Lord; *acetana* — unconscious; *hañā* — becoming.

### Translation

**One day Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu ate betel nuts offered to the Deity, but they acted as an intoxicant, and He fell down on the ground unconscious.**

### Purport

Betel nuts are an intoxicant, and therefore the regulative principles prohibit eating them. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s pastime of fainting after eating betel nuts is a solid instruction to all of us that one should not touch betel nuts, even those offered to Viṣṇu, just as one should not touch grains on the Ekādaśī day. Of course, Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s fainting had a particular purpose. As the Supreme Personality of Godhead, He can do whatever He likes and eat whatever He wants, but we should not imitate His pastimes.

### Verse text

*ei mata nānā līlā kare gaurahari  
ki kāraṇe līlā, — ihā bujhite nā pāri*

### Synonyms

*ei* *mata* — in this way; *nānā* — various; *līlā* — pastimes; *kare* — does; *gaurahari* — Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu; *ki* *kāraṇe* — what is the reason; *līlā* — pastimes; *ihā* — this; *bujhite* — to understand; *nā* — not; *pāri* — I am able.

### Translation

**In this way Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu performed various pastimes, but why He did so I cannot understand.**

### Purport

The Supreme Personality of Godhead and His devotees who come to this world are executing a mission, and therefore sometimes they act in a way that is very difficult to understand. It is said, therefore, *vaiṣṇavera kriyā-mudrā vijñeha nā bujhaya:* even if one is a very learned and intelligent scholar, he cannot understand the activities of a Vaiṣṇava. A Vaiṣṇava accepts anything favorable for executing his mission. But foolish persons, not knowing the purpose of such exalted Vaiṣṇavas, indulge in criticizing them. That is forbidden. Since no one can understand what a Vaiṣṇava does for the purpose of executing his mission, to criticize such a Vaiṣṇava is the offense called *sādhu-nindā.*
