CHAPTER THIRTEEN

The thirteenth chapter describes Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s appearance. The entire *Ādi-līlā* describes Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s household life, and similarly the *Antya-līlā* describes His life in the *sannyāsa* order. Within the Lord’s *antya-līlā,* the first six years of His *sannyāsa* life are called the *madhya-līlā.* During this time, Caitanya Mahāprabhu toured southern India, went to Vṛndāvana, returned from Vṛndāvana and preached the *saṅkīrtana* movement.

A learned *brāhmaṇa* named Upendra Miśra, who resided in the district of Śrīhaṭṭa, was the father of Jagannātha Miśra, who came to Navadvīpa to study under the direction of Nīlāmbara Cakravartī and then settled there after marrying Nīlāmbara Cakravartī’s daughter, Śacīdevī. Śrī Śacīdevī gave birth to eight children, all daughters, who died one after another immediately after birth. After her ninth pregnancy she gave birth to a son, who was named Viśvarūpa. Then, in 1407 Śaka Era (A.D. 1486), in the full-moon evening of the month of Phālguna, with the constellation of Siṁha (Leo) on the horizon, Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu appeared as the son of Śrī Śacīdevī and Jagannātha Miśra. After hearing of the birth of Caitanya Mahāprabhu, learned scholars and *brāhmaṇas,* bringing many gifts, came to see the newborn baby. Nīlāmbara Cakravartī, who was a great astrologer, immediately prepared a horoscope, and by astrological calculation he saw that the child was a great personality. This chapter describes the symptoms of this great personality.

स प्रसीदतु चैतन्यदेवो यस्य प्रसादतः ।  
तल्लीलावर्णने योग्यः सद्यः स्यादधमोऽप्यय़म् ॥१ ॥

### Verse text

*sa prasīdatu caitanya-  
devo yasya prasādataḥ  
tal-līlā-varṇane yogyaḥ  
sadyaḥ syād adhamo ’py ayam*

### Synonyms

*saḥ* — He; *prasīdatu* — may bestow His blessings; *caitanya*-*devaḥ* — Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu; *yasya* — of whom; *prasādataḥ* — by the grace; *tat*-*līlā* — His pastimes; *varṇane* — in the description; *yogyaḥ* — able; *sadyaḥ* — immediately; *syāt* — becomes possible; *adhamaḥ* — the most fallen; *api* — although; *ayam* — I am.

### Translation

**I wish the grace of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, by whose mercy even one who is fallen can describe the pastimes of the Lord.**

### Purport

To describe Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu or Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, one needs supernatural power, which is the grace and mercy of the Lord. Without this grace and mercy, one cannot compose transcendental literature. By dint of the grace of the Lord, however, even one who is unfit for a literary career can describe wonderful transcendental topics. Description of Kṛṣṇa is possible for one who is empowered. *Kṛṣṇa-śakti vinā nahe tāra pravartana* (Cc. *Antya* 7.11). Unless endowed with the mercy of the Lord, one cannot preach of the Lord’s name, fame, qualities, form, entourage and so on. It should be concluded, therefore, that the writing of *Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta* by Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī manifests specific mercy bestowed upon the author, although he thought of himself as the most fallen. We should not consider him fallen because he describes himself as such. Rather, anyone who is able to compose such transcendental literature is our esteemed master.

### Verse text

*jaya śrī-caitanyacandrera bhakta candra-gaṇa  
sabāra prema jyotsnāya ujjvala tri-bhuvana*

### Synonyms

*jaya* — all glories; *śrī*-*caitanya* — of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu; *candrera* — who is as bright as the moon; *bhakta* — devotees; *candra*-*gaṇa* — other moons; *sabāra* — of all of them; *prema*-*jyotsnāya* — by the full light of love of Godhead; *ujjvala* — bright; *tri*-*bhuvana* — all the three worlds.

### Translation

**All glories to the moons who are devotees of the principal moon, Lord Caitanyacandra! Their bright moonshine illuminates the entire universe.**

### Purport

In this verse we find the moon described as *candra-gaṇa,* which is plural in number. This indicates that there are many moons. In the *Bhagavad-gītā* (10.21) the Lord says, *nakṣatrāṇām ahaṁ śaśī:* “Among the stars, I am the moon.” All the stars are like the moon. Western astronomers consider the stars to be suns, but Vedic astronomers, following the Vedic scriptures, consider them moons. The sun has the ability to shine powerfully, and the moons reflect the sunshine and therefore look brilliant. In the *Caitanya-caritāmṛta* Kṛṣṇa is described to be like the sun. The supreme powerful is the Supreme Personality of Godhead Śrī Kṛṣṇa, or Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and His devotees are also bright and illuminating because they reflect the supreme sun. The *Caitanya-caritāmṛta* (*Madhya* 22.31) states:

*kṛṣṇa — sūrya-sama; māyā haya andhakāra  
yāhāṅ kṛṣṇa, tāhāṅ nāhi māyāra adhikāra*

“Kṛṣṇa is bright like the sun. As soon as the sun appears, there is no question of darkness or nescience.” Similarly, the present verse also describes that by the illumination of all the moons, brightened by the reflection of the Kṛṣṇa sun, or by the grace of all the devotees of Caitanya Mahāprabhu, the entire world will be illuminated, despite the darkness of Kali-yuga. Only the devotees of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu can dissipate the darkness of Kali-yuga, the ignorance of the population of this age. No one else can do so. We therefore wish that all the devotees of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement may reflect the supreme sun and thus dissipate the darkness of the entire world.

### Translation

**When teaching a course in grammar \[vyākaraṇa\] and explaining it with notes, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu taught His disciples about the glories of Lord Kṛṣṇa. All explanations culminated in Kṛṣṇa, and His disciples would understand them very easily. Thus His influence was wonderful.**

### Purport

Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī compiled a grammar in two parts, named *Laghu-hari-nāmāmṛta-vyākaraṇa* and *Bṛhad-dhari-nāmāmṛta-vyākaraṇa.* If someone studies these two texts in *vyākaraṇa,* or grammar, he learns the grammatical rules of the Sanskrit language and simultaneously learns how to become a great devotee of Lord Kṛṣṇa.

In the *Caitanya-bhāgavata, Madhya-khaṇḍa,* first chapter, there is a statement about the method by which Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu taught grammar. Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu explained the aphorisms of grammar to be eternal, like the holy name of Kṛṣṇa. As stated in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (15.15), *vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyaḥ.* The purport of all revealed scriptures is understanding of Kṛṣṇa. Therefore if a person explains anything that is not Kṛṣṇa, he simply wastes his time laboring hard without fulfilling the aim of his life. If one simply becomes a teacher or professor of education but does not understand Kṛṣṇa, it is to be understood that he is among the lowest of mankind, as stated in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (7.15): *narādhamā māyayāpahṛta-jñānāḥ.* If one does not know the essence of all revealed scriptures but still becomes a teacher, his teaching is like the disturbing braying of an ass.

### Translation

**When Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu was a student, He asked whomever He met to chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra. In this way He inundated the whole town of Navadvīpa with the chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa.**

### Purport

The present Navadvīpa-dhāma is but a part of the whole of Navadvīpa. Navadvīpa means “nine islands.” These nine islands, which occupy an area of land estimated at thirty-two square miles, are surrounded by different branches of the Ganges. In all nine of those islands of the Navadvīpa area there are different places for cultivating devotional service. It is stated in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (7.5.23) that there are *nava-vidha bhakti,* nine different activities of devotional service:

*śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ* *smaraṇaṁ pāda-sevanam  
arcanaṁ vandanaṁ dāsyaṁ* *sakhyam ātma-nivedanam*

There are different islands in the Navadvīpa area for cultivation of these nine varieties of devotional service. They are as follows: (1) Antardvīpa, (2) Sīmantadvīpa, (3) Godrumadvīpa, (4) Madhyadvīpa, (5) Koladvīpa, (6) Ṛtudvīpa, (7) Jahnudvīpa, (8) Modadruma-dvīpa and (9) Rudradvīpa. According to the settlement map, our ISKCON Navadvīpa center is situated on the Rudradvīpa island. Below Rudradvīpa, in Antardvīpa, is Māyāpur. There Śrī Jagannātha Miśra, the father of Caitanya Mahāprabhu, used to reside. In all these different islands, Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, as a young man, used to lead His *saṅkīrtana* party. He thus inundated the entire area with the waves of love of Kṛṣṇa.

### Translation

**The saṅkīrtana movement went on from one part of the town to another, as the Lord wandered everywhere performing kīrtana. In this way He inundated the whole world by distributing love of Godhead.**

### Purport

One may raise the question how all three worlds became inundated with love of Kṛṣṇa, since Caitanya Mahāprabhu performed *kīrtana* only in the Navadvīpa area. The answer is that Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is Kṛṣṇa Himself. The entire cosmic manifestation results from the Lord’s first setting it in motion. Similarly, since the *saṅkīrtana* movement was first set in motion five hundred years ago by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s desire that it spread all over the universe, the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, in continuity of that same motion, is now spreading all over the world, and in this way it will gradually spread all over the universe. With the spread of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, everyone will merge in an ocean of love of Kṛṣṇa.

### Translation

### Purport

A person who is advanced in Kṛṣṇa consciousness always feels separation from Kṛṣṇa because such a feeling of separation excels the feeling of meeting Kṛṣṇa. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, in His last twelve years of existence within this world at Jagannātha Purī, taught the people of the world how, with a feeling of separation, one can develop His dormant love of Kṛṣṇa. Such feelings of separation or meeting with Kṛṣṇa are different stages of love of Godhead. These feelings develop in time when a person seriously engages in devotional service. The highest stage is called *prema-bhakti,* but this stage is attained by executing *sādhana-bhakti.* One should not try to elevate himself artificially to the stage of *prema-bhakti* without seriously following the regulative principles of *sādhana-bhakti. Prema-bhakti* is the stage of relishing, whereas *sādhana-bhakti* is the stage of improving in devotional service. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu taught this cult of devotional service in full detail by practical application in His own life. It is said, therefore, *āpani ācari’ bhakti śikhāimu sabāre.* Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is Kṛṣṇa Himself, and in the role of a *kṛṣṇa-bhakta,* a devotee of Kṛṣṇa, He instructed the entire world how one can execute devotional service and thus go back home, back to Godhead, in due course of time.

### Translation

**As Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī talked inconsistently when She met Uddhava, so also Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu relished, both day and night, such ecstatic talk in the mood of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī.**

### Purport

In this connection one should refer to Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī’s soliloquy after meeting Uddhava in Vṛndāvana. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu presented a similar picture of such ecstatic imaginary talking. Full of jealousy and madness symptomizing neglect by Kṛṣṇa, Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī, criticizing a bumblebee, talked just like a madwoman. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, in the last days of His pastimes, exhibited all the symptoms of such ecstasy. In this connection one should refer to the fourth chapter of the *Ādi-līlā,* verses 107 and 108.

### Translation

**The Lord used to read the books of Vidyāpati, Jayadeva and Caṇḍīdāsa, relishing their songs with His confidential associates like Śrī Rāmānanda Rāya and Svarūpa Dāmodara Gosvāmī.**

### Purport

Vidyāpati was a famous composer of songs about the pastimes of Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa. He was an inhabitant of Mithilā, born in a *brāhmaṇa* family. It is calculated that he composed his songs during the reign of King Śivasiṁha and Queen Lachimādevī, in the beginning of the fourteenth century of the Śaka Era, almost one hundred years before the appearance of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. The twelfth generation of Vidyāpati’s descendants is still living. Vidyāpati’s songs about the pastimes of Lord Kṛṣṇa express intense feelings of separation from Kṛṣṇa, and Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu relished all those songs in His ecstasy of separation from Kṛṣṇa.

Jayadeva was born during the reign of Mahārāja Lakṣmaṇa Sena of Bengal, in the eleventh or twelfth century of the Śaka Era. His father was Bhojadeva, and his mother was Vāmādevī. For many years he lived in Navadvīpa, then the capital of Bengal. His birthplace was in the Birbhum district, in the village Kendubilva. In the opinion of some authorities, however, he was born in Orissa, and still others say that he was born in southern India. He passed the last days of his life in Jagannātha Purī. One of his famous books is *Gīta-govinda,* which is full of transcendental mellow feelings of separation from Kṛṣṇa. The *gopīs* felt separation from Kṛṣṇa before the *rāsa* dance, as mentioned in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,* and the *Gīta-govinda* expresses such feelings. There are many commentaries on the *Gīta-govinda* by many Vaiṣṇavas.

Caṇḍīdāsa was born in the village of Nānnura, which is also in the Birbhum district of Bengal. He was born of a *brāhmaṇa* family, and it is said that he also took birth in the beginning of the fourteenth century, Śakābda Era. It has been suggested that Caṇḍīdāsa and Vidyāpati were great friends because the writings of both express the transcendental feelings of separation profusely. The feelings of ecstasy described by Caṇḍīdāsa and Vidyāpati were actually exhibited by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. He relished all those feelings in the role of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī, and His appropriate associates for this purpose were Śrī Rāmānanda Rāya and Śrī Svarūpa Dāmodara Gosvāmī. These intimate associates of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu helped the Lord very much in the pastimes in which He felt like Rādhārāṇī.

Śrī Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura comments in this connection that such feelings of separation as Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu enjoyed from the books of Vidyāpati, Caṇḍīdāsa and Jayadeva are especially reserved for persons like Śrī Rāmānanda Rāya and Svarūpa Dāmodara, who were *paramahaṁsas,* men of the topmost perfection, because of their advanced spiritual consciousness. Such topics are not to be discussed by ordinary persons imitating the activities of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. For critical students of mundane poetry and literary men without God consciousness who are after bodily sense gratification, there is no need to read such a high standard of transcendental literature. Persons who are after sense gratification should not try to imitate *rāgānuga* devotional service. The songs of Caṇḍīdāsa, Vidyāpati and Jayadeva describe the transcendental activities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Mundane reviewers of these songs simply help people in general become debauchees, and this leads only to social scandals and atheism in the world. One should not misunderstand the pastimes of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa to be the activities of a mundane young boy and girl. The mundane sexual activities of young boys and girls are most abominable. Therefore, those who are in bodily consciousness and who desire sense gratification are forbidden to indulge in discussions of the transcendental pastimes of Śrī Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa.

### Translation

**In separation from Kṛṣṇa, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu relished all these ecstatic activities, and thus He fulfilled His own desires.**

### Purport

In the beginning of the *Caitanya-caritāmṛta* it is said that Lord Caitanya appeared in order to taste the feelings Rādhārāṇī felt upon seeing Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa Himself could not understand the ecstatic feelings of Rādhārāṇī toward Him, and therefore He desired to accept the role of Rādhārāṇī and thereby taste these feelings. Lord Caitanya is Kṛṣṇa with the feelings of Rādhārāṇī; in other words, He is a combination of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa. It is therefore said, *śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya rādhā-kṛṣṇa nahe anya.* By worshiping Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu alone, one can relish the loving affairs of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa together. One should therefore try to understand Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa not directly but through Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and through His devotees. Śrīla Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura therefore says, *rūpa-raghunātha-pade haibe ākuti, kabe hāma bujhaba se yugala-pīriti:* “When shall I develop a mentality of service toward Śrī Rūpa Gosvāmī, Sanātana Gosvāmī, Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī and the other devotees of Lord Caitanya and thus become eligible to understand the pastimes of Śrī Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa?”

Some of the family descendants of Nīlāmbara Cakravartī still live in the village of the name Magḍobā, in the district of Faridpur, in Bangladesh. His nephew was Jagannātha Cakravartī, also known as Māmu Ṭhākura, who became a disciple of Paṇḍita Gosvāmī and stayed at Jagannātha Purī as the priest of Ṭoṭā-gopīnātha. Nīlāmbara Cakravartī lived at Navadvīpa, in the neighborhood of Belapukuriyā. This fact is mentioned in the book *Prema-vilāsa.* Because he lived near the house of the Kazi, the Kazi was also considered one of the maternal uncles of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. The Kazi used to address Nīlāmbara Cakravartī as *kākā,* or ‘uncle.’ One cannot separate the residence of the Kazi from Vāmanapukura because the tomb of the Kazi is still existing there. Formerly the place was known as Belapukuriyā, and now it is called Vāmanapukura. This has been ascertained by archeological evidence.”

### Translation

**In Rāḍhadeśa, the part of Bengal where the Ganges is not visible, Nityānanda Prabhu, Gaṅgādāsa Paṇḍita, Murāri Gupta and Mukunda took birth.**

### Purport

Here *rāḍha-deśe* refers to the village of the name Ekacakrā, in the district of Birbhum, next to Burdwan. After the Burdwan railway station there is another branch line, which is called the Loop Line of the Eastern Railway, and there is a railway station of the name Mallārapura. Eight miles east of this railway station, Ekacakrā village is still situated. Ekacakrā village extends north and south for an area of about eight miles. Other villages, namely Vīracandra-pura and Vīrabhadra-pura, are situated within the area of the village of Ekacakrā. In honor of the holy name of Vīrabhadra Gosvāmī, these places are renowned as Vīracandra-pura and Vīrabhadra-pura.

In the Bengali year 1331 (A.D. 1924) a thunderbolt struck the temple of Ekacakrā-grāma. Therefore the temple is now in a broken state. Before this, there were no such accidents in that quarter. Within the temple there is a Deity of Śrī Kṛṣṇa established by Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu. The name of the Deity is Baṅkima Rāya or Bāṅkā Rāya.

On Baṅkima Rāya’s right side is a deity of Jāhnavā, and on His left side is Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī. The priests of the temple describe that Lord Nityānanda Prabhu entered within the body of Baṅkima Rāya and that the deity of Jāhnavā-mātā was therefore later placed on the right side of Baṅkima Rāya. Afterwards, many other Deities were installed within the temple. On another throne within the temple are Deities of Muralīdhara and Rādhā-Mādhava. On another throne are Deities of Manomohana, Vṛndāvana-candra and Gaura-Nitāi. But Baṅkima Rāya is the Deity originally installed by Nityānanda Prabhu.

On the eastern side of the temple is a *ghāṭa* known as Kadamba-khaṇḍī on the bank of a river called the Yamunā, and it is said that the Deity of Baṅkima Rāya was floating in the water and Lord Nityānanda Prabhu picked Him up and then installed Him in the temple. Thereafter, in a place known as Bhaḍḍāpura, in the village of Vīracandra-pura, about half a mile west, in a place underneath a *nima* tree, Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī was found. For this reason, the Rādhārāṇī of Baṅkima Rāya was known as Bhaḍḍāpurera Ṭhākurāṇī, the mistress of Bhaḍḍāpura. On another throne, on the right side of Baṅkima Rāya, is a Deity of Yogamāyā.

Now the temple and temple corridor rest on a high plinth, and on a concrete structure in front of the temple is a *kīrtana* hall. It is also said that on the northern side of the temple there was a Deity of Lord Śiva named Bhāṇḍīśvara and that the father of Nityānanda Prabhu, Hāḍāi Paṇḍita, used to worship that Deity. At present, however, the Bhāṇḍīśvara Deity is missing, and in his place a Jagannātha Svāmī Deity has been installed. Lord Nityānanda Prabhu did not factually construct any temples. The temple was constructed at the time of Vīrabhadra Prabhu. In the Bengali year 1298 (A.D. 1891), a *brahmacārī* of the name Śivānanda Svāmī repaired the temple, for it had become dilapidated.

In this temple there is an arrangement to offer food to the Deity on the basis of seventeen seers (about thirty-four pounds) of rice and necessary vegetables. The present priestly order of the temple belongs to the family of Gopījana-vallabhānanda, one of the branches of Nityānanda Prabhu. There is a land settlement in the name of the temple, and income from this land finances the expenditures for the temple. There are three parties of priestly *gosvāmīs* who take charge of the temple management, one after another. A few steps from the temple is a place known as Viśrāmatalā, where it is said that Nityānanda Prabhu in His childhood used to enjoy sporting with His boyfriends by enacting the *rāsa-līlā* and various other pastimes of Vṛndāvana.

Near the temple is a place named Āmalītalā (Imlitala), which is so named because of a big tamarind tree there. According to a party named the Neḍādi-sampradāya, Vīrabhadra Prabhu, with the assistance of twelve hundred Neḍās (Buddhist monks), dug a great lake of the name Śvetagaṅgā. Outside of the temple are tombs of the Gosvāmīs, and there is a small river known as the Mauḍeśvara, which is called the water of Yamunā. Within half a mile from this small river is the birthplace of Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu. It appears that there was a big *kīrtana* hall in front of the temple, but later it became dilapidated. It is now covered by banyan trees. Later on, a temple was constructed within which Gaura-Nityānanda Deities are existing. The temple was constructed by the late Prasannakumāra Kārapharmā. A tablet was installed in his memory in the Bengali year 1323 (A.D. 1916), in the month of Vaiśākha (April-May).

The place where Nityānanda Prabhu appeared is called Garbhavāsa. There is an allotment of about forty-three *bighās* (fourteen acres) of land to continue the worship in a temple there. The Mahārāja of Dinājapura donated twenty *bighās* of land (about six and a half acres) in this connection. It is said that near the place known as Garbhavāsa, Hāḍāi Paṇḍita conducted a primary school. The priests of this place, listed in a genealogical table, were as follows: (1) Śrī Rāghavacandra, (2) Jagadānanda dāsa, (3) Kṛṣṇadāsa, (4) Nityānanda dāsa, (5) Rāmadāsa, (6) Vrajamohana dāsa, (7) Kānāi dāsa, (8) Gauradāsa, (9) Śivānanda dāsa and (10) Haridāsa. Kṛṣṇadāsa belonged to the Ciḍiyā-kuñja at Vṛndāvana. The date of his disappearance is Kṛṣṇa-janmāṣṭamī. Ciḍiyā-kuñja is a place now managed by the *gosvāmīs* of Śṛṅgāra-ghāṭa in Vṛndāvana. They are also known as belonging to the Nityānanda family, most probably on the basis of their relationship with Kṛṣṇadāsa.

Near Garbhavāsa is a place called Bakulatalā, where Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu and His boyfriends used to take part in sporting activities known as *jhāla-jhapeṭā.* There is a *bakula* tree there that is wonderful because all its branches and subbranches look like the hoods of serpents. It has been suggested that by the desire of Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu, Anantadeva manifested Himself in that way. The tree is very old. It is said that formerly it had two trunks, but later on, when the playmates of Nityānanda Prabhu felt inconvenience in jumping from the branches of one trunk to those of the other, Nityānanda Prabhu, by His mercy, merged the two trunks into one.

Another place nearby is named Hāṅṭugāḍā. It is said that Lord Nityānanda Prabhu brought all the holy places there. Therefore the people in the surrounding villages go there instead of to the Ganges to take bath. It is named Hāṅṭugāḍā because Śrīla Nityānanda Prabhu used to perform the *dadhi-ciḍā* festival of distributing chipped rice with yogurt *prasādam* there and He took the *prasādam* kneeling down. A sanctified lake in this place is always full of water throughout the year. A great fair is held there during Goṣṭhāṣṭamī, and there is another big fair on the birthday of Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu. In the *Gaura-gaṇoddeśa-dīpikā* (58-63) it is described that Halāyudha, Baladeva, Viśvarūpa and Saṅkarṣaṇa appeared as Nityānanda Avadhūta.

We simply stand on the platform of devotional service and preach the same principles all over the world.

tad ahaṁ bhakty-upahṛtam* *aśnāmi prayatātmanaḥ*

“If one offers Me with love and devotion a leaf, a flower, a fruit or water, I will accept it.” Following this principle, Advaita Prabhu pleased the Supreme Personality of Godhead with *tulasī* leaves and water of the Ganges.

### Purport

Viśvarūpa was the elder brother of Gaurahari, Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. When arrangements were being made for the marriage of Viśvarūpa, He took *sannyāsa* and left home. He took the *sannyāsa* name of Śaṅkarāraṇya. In 1431 Śakābda Era (A.D. 1509), He disappeared in Pāṇḍarapura, in the district of Sholapur. As an incarnation of Saṅkarṣaṇa, He is both the ingredient and immediate cause of the creation of this material world. He is nondifferent from Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, for the *aṁśa* and the *aṁśī,* or the part and the whole, are not different. As an incarnation of Saṅkarṣaṇa, Viśvarūpa belongs to the quadruple manifestation of *catur-vyūha.* In the *Gaura-candrodaya* it is said that Viśvarūpa, after His so-called demise, remained mixed within Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu.

### Translation

**The husband and wife \[Jagannātha Miśra and Śacīmātā\], having gotten Viśvarūpa as their son, were very pleased within their minds. Because of their pleasure, they specifically began to serve the lotus feet of Govinda.**

### Purport

There is a common saying in India that everyone goes to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead when he is in distress, but when a person is in an opulent position, he forgets God. In the *Bhagavad-gītā* (7.16) this is confirmed:

*catur-vidhā bhajante māṁ* *janāḥ sukṛtino ’rjuna  
ārto jijñāsur arthārthī* *jñānī ca bharatarṣabha*

“If backed by pious activities in the past, four kinds of men — namely those who are distressed, those in need of money, those searching after knowledge and those who are inquisitive — become interested in devotional service.” The husband and wife, Jagannātha Miśra and Śacīmātā, were very unhappy because their eight daughters had passed away. Now, when they got Viśvarūpa as their son, certainly they became extremely happy. They knew that it was by the grace of the Lord that they were endowed with such happiness and opulence. Therefore instead of forgetting the Lord, they became more and more adherent in rendering service to the lotus feet of Govinda. When a common man becomes opulent, he forgets God; but the more opulent a devotee becomes by the grace of the Lord, the more he becomes attached to the service of the Lord.

### Translation

**“Anywhere and everywhere I go, all people offer me respect. Even without my asking, they voluntarily give me riches, clothing and paddy.”**

### Purport

A *brāhmaṇa* does not become anyone’s servant. To render service to someone else is the business of the *śūdras.* A *brāhmaṇa* is always independent because he is a teacher, spiritual master and advisor to society. The members of society provide him with all the necessities of life. In the *Bhagavad-gītā* the Lord says He has divided society into four divisions — *brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya* and *śūdra.* A society cannot run smoothly without this scientific division. A *brāhmaṇa* should give good advice to all the members of society, a *kṣatriya* should look after the administration, maintaining law and order in society, *vaiśyas* should produce and trade to meet all the needs of society, whereas *śūdras* should render service to the higher sections of society (the *brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas* and *vaiśyas*)*.*

Jagannātha Miśra was a *brāhmaṇa;* therefore people would send him all bodily necessities — money, cloth, grain and so on. While Lord Caitanya was in the womb of Śacīmātā, Jagannātha Miśra received all these necessities of life without asking for them. Because of the presence of the Lord in his family, everyone offered him due respect as a *brāhmaṇa.* In other words, if a *brāhmaṇa* or Vaiṣṇava sticks to his position as an eternal servant of the Lord and executes the will of the Lord, there is no question of scarcity for his personal maintenance or the needs of his family.

### Translation

**After this conversation, both husband and wife were very jubilant, and together they rendered service to the household śālagrāma-śilā.**

### Purport

Especially in every *brāhmaṇa’s* house there must be a *śālagrāma-śilā* to be worshiped by the *brāhmaṇa* family. This system is still current. People who are *brāhmaṇas* by caste, who are born in a *brāhmaṇa* family, must worship the *śālagrāma-śilā.* Unfortunately, with the progress of Kali-yuga, the so-called *brāhmaṇas,* although very proud of taking birth in *brāhmaṇa* families, no longer worship the *śālagrāma-śilā.* But actually it has been a custom since time immemorial that a person born in a *brāhmaṇa* family must worship the *śālagrāma-śilā* in all circumstances. In our Kṛṣṇa consciousness society, some of the members are very anxious to introduce worship of the *śālagrāma-śilā,* but we have purposely refrained from introducing it because most of the members of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement do not originally come from families of the *brāhmaṇa* caste. After some time, when we find that they are actually situated strictly in the line of brahminical behavior, *śālagrāma-śilā* worship will be introduced.

In this age, the worship of the *śālagrāma-śilā* is not as important as the chanting of the holy name of the Lord. That is the injunction of the *śāstra: harer nāma harer nāma harer nāmaiva kevalaṁ/ kalau nāsty eva nāsty eva nāsty eva gatir anyathā.* Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī’s opinion is that by chanting the holy name offenselessly one becomes completely perfect. Nevertheless, just to purify the situation of the mind, worship of the Deity in the temple is also necessary. Therefore when one is advanced in spiritual consciousness or is perfectly situated on a spiritual platform, he may take to the worship of the *śālagrāma-śilā.*

The transference of the Lord from the heart of Jagannātha Miśra to the heart of Śacīmātā is explained by Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura as follows: “It is to be concluded that Jagannātha Miśra and Śacīmātā are *nitya-siddhas,* ever-pure associates of the Lord. Their hearts are always uncontaminated, and therefore they never forget the Supreme Personality of Godhead. A common man in this material world has a contaminated heart. He must therefore first purify his heart to come to the transcendental position. But Jagannātha Miśra and Śacīmātā were not a common man and woman with contaminated hearts. When the heart is uncontaminated, it is said to be in the existential position of Vasudeva. Vasudeva can beget Vāsudeva, or Kṛṣṇa, who is transcendentally situated.”

It is to be understood that Śacīdevī did not become pregnant as an ordinary woman becomes pregnant because of sense indulgence. One should not think the pregnancy of Śacīmātā to be that of an ordinary woman, because that is an offense. One can understand the pregnancy of Śacīmātā when one is actually advanced in spiritual consciousness and fully engaged in the devotional service of the Lord.

In *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (10.2.16) it is stated:

*bhagavān api viśvātmā* *bhaktānām abhayaṅ-karaḥ  
āviveśāṁśa-bhāgena* *mana ānakadundubheḥ*

This is a statement regarding the birth of Lord Kṛṣṇa. The incarnation of the Lord entered the mind of Vasudeva and was then transferred to the mind of Devakī. Śrīla Śrīdhara Svāmī gives the following annotation in this connection: *‘mana āviveśa’ manasy āvirbabhūva; jīvānām iva na dhātu-sambandha ity arthaḥ.* There was no question of the seminal discharge necessary for the birth of an ordinary human being. Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī also comments in this connection that Lord Kṛṣṇa first appeared in the mind of Ānakadundubhi, Vasudeva, and was then transferred to the mind of Devakī-devī. Thus the spiritual bliss in the mind of Devakī-devī gradually increased, just as the moon increases every night until it becomes a full moon. At the time of His appearance, Lord Kṛṣṇa came out of the mind of Devakī and appeared within the prison house of Kaṁsa, by the side of Devakī’s bed. At that time, by the spell of *yogamāyā,* Devakī thought that her child had now been born. In this connection, even the demigods from the celestial kingdom were also bewildered. As it is stated, *muhyanti yat sūrayaḥ* (*Bhāg.* 1.1.1). They came to offer their prayers to Devakī, thinking that the Supreme Lord was within her womb. The demigods came to Mathurā from their celestial kingdom. This indicates that Mathurā is still more important than the celestial kingdom of the upper planetary system.

Lord Kṛṣṇa, as the eternal son of Yaśodāmayī, is always present in Vṛndāvana. The pastimes of Lord Kṛṣṇa are continuously going on within both this material world and the spiritual world. In such pastimes, the Lord always thinks Himself the eternal son of mother Yaśodā and father Nanda Mahārāja. In the Tenth Canto of *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,* chapter six, verse 43, it is stated, “When magnanimous, broad-hearted Nanda Mahārāja came back from a tour, he immediately took his son Kṛṣṇa on his lap and experienced transcendental bliss by smelling His head.” Similarly, in the Tenth Canto, ninth chapter, verse 21, it is said, “This Personality of Godhead, appearing as the son of a cowherd damsel, is easily available and understandable to devotees, whereas those who are under the concept of bodily life, even though they are very much advanced in austerity and penance, or even though they are great philosophers, are unable to understand Him.”

Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura next quotes Śrīpāda Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa, who refers to the prayers offered by the demigods to Lord Kṛṣṇa in the womb of Devakī and summarizes the birth of Kṛṣṇa as follows: “As the rising moon manifests light in the east, so Devakī, who was always situated on the transcendental platform, having been initiated in the Kṛṣṇa *mantra* by Vasudeva, the son of Śūrasena, kept Kṛṣṇa within her heart.” From this statement of *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (10.2.18) it is understood that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, having been transferred from the heart of Ānakadundubhi, or Vasudeva, manifested Himself in the heart of Devakī. According to Śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa, “the heart of Devakī” means the womb of Devakī because in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* 10.2.41 the demigods say, *diṣṭyāmba te kukṣi-gataḥ paraḥ pumān:* “Mother Devakī, the Lord is already within your womb.” Therefore, that the Lord was transferred from the heart of Vasudeva to the heart of Devakī means that He was transferred to the womb of Devakī.

Similarly, in regard to the appearance of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu as described in the *Caitanya-caritāmṛta,* the words *viśeṣe sevana kare govinda-caraṇa,* “they specifically began to worship the lotus feet of Govinda,” indicate that exactly as Kṛṣṇa appeared in the heart of Devakī through the heart of Vasudeva, so Lord Caitanya appeared in the heart of Śacīdevī through the heart of Jagannātha Miśra. This is the mystery of the appearance of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Consequently, one should not think of Lord Caitanya’s appearance as that of a common man or living entity. This subject matter is a little difficult to understand, but for devotees of the Lord it will not at all be difficult to realize the statements given by Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī.

### Purport

Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura, in his *Amṛta-pravāha-bhāṣya,* has presented the horoscope of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu as follows:

*śaka* 1407/10/22/28/45\*  
*dinam*

7 11 8

15 54 38

40 37 40

13 6 23

The explanation of the horoscope given by Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura is that at the time of the birth of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu the planets were situated as follows: Śukra (Venus) was in Meṣa-rāśi (Aries) and the *nakṣatra* (lunar mansion) of Aśvinī; Ketu (the ninth planet) was in Siṁha-rāśi (Leo) and Uttaraphalgunī; Candra (the moon) was in Pūrvaphalgunī (the eleventh lunar mansion); Śani (Saturn) was in Vṛścika-rāśi (Scorpio) and Jyeṣthā; Bṛhaspati (Jupiter) was in Dhanu-rāśi (Sagittarius) and Pūrvāṣāḍhā; Maṅgala (Mars) was in Makara-rāśi (Capricorn) and Śravaṇā; Ravi (the sun) was in Kumbha-rāśi (Aquarius) and Pūrvabhādrapāda; Rāhu was in Pūrvabhādrapāda; and Budha (Mercury) was in Mīna-rāśi (Pisces) and Uttarabhādrapāda. The *lagna* was Siṁha*.*

*siṁha-rāśi, siṁha-lagna, ucca graha-gaṇa  
ṣaḍ-varga, aṣṭa-varga, sarva sulakṣaṇa*

### Synonyms

*siṁha* — the lion; *rāśi* — sign of the zodiac; *siṁha* — the lion; *lagna* — birth moment; *ucca* — high; *graha*-*gaṇa* — all planets; *ṣaṭ*-*varga* — six divisions; *aṣṭa*-*varga* — eight divisions; *sarva* — all; *su*-*lakṣaṇa* — symptoms of auspiciousness.

### Translation

**\[According to the Jyotir-veda, or Vedic astrology, the auspicious birth moment is described as follows:\] The moon was in Leo \[the figure of the lion in the zodiac\], Leo was the ascendant, several planets were strongly positioned, and the ṣaḍ-varga and aṣṭa-varga showed all-auspicious influences.**

### Purport

Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura, who was previously a great astrologer, explains this verse as follows: The *ṣaḍ-varga* (six divisions) are technically called *kṣetra, horā, drekkāṇa, navāṁśa, dvādaśāṁśa* and *triṁśāṁśa.* According to Jyotir-vedic astrology, when the relationship between the planets and the rulers of these six divisions is determined, the auspiciousness of the moment of birth can be calculated. In the book named *Bṛhaj-jātaka* and other books there are directions for interpreting the movements of the stars and planets. One who knows the process of calculating the *aṣṭa-varga* (eight divisions) can predict auspicious and inauspicious events. This science is known especially by persons who are called *horā-śāstra-vit,* or those who know the astrological scriptures*.* On the strength of astrological calculations from the *horā* scriptures, Nīlāmbara Cakravartī, the grandfather of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, had ascertained the auspicious moment when the Lord would appear.

It is customary in India that all the followers of the Vedic scriptures bathe in the Ganges or the sea as soon as there is a lunar or solar eclipse. All strict followers of the Vedic religion stand up in the water throughout the whole period of the eclipse and chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra.* At the time of the birth of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, such a lunar eclipse took place, and naturally all the people standing in the water were chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare.

### Purport

It is understood that Advaita Prabhu, at that time, was in His own paternal house at Śāntipura. Haridāsa Ṭhākura frequently used to meet Him. Coincidentally, therefore, he was also there, and upon the birth of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu both of them immediately began to dance. But no one in Śāntipura could understand why those two saintly persons were dancing.

**Seeing the lunar eclipse and laughing, Advaita Ācārya and Haridāsa Ṭhākura immediately went to the bank of the Ganges and bathed in the river in great jubilation. Taking advantage of the occasion of the lunar eclipse, Advaita Ācārya, by His mental strength, distributed various types of charity to the brāhmaṇas.**

### Purport

It is the custom of Hindus to give in charity to the poor as much as possible during the time of a lunar or solar eclipse. Advaita Ācārya, therefore, taking advantage of this eclipse, distributed many varieties of charity to the *brāhmaṇas.* In *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (10.3.11) there is a statement that when Kṛṣṇa took His birth, Vasudeva immediately took advantage of this moment and distributed ten thousand cows to the *brāhmaṇas.* It is customary among Hindus that at the time a child is born, especially a male child, the parents distribute great charity in jubilation. Advaita Ācārya was actually interested in distributing charity because of Lord Caitanya’s birth at the time of the lunar eclipse. People could not understand, however, why Advaita Ācārya was giving such a great variety of things in charity. He did so not because of the lunar eclipse but because of the Lord’s taking birth at that moment. He distributed charity exactly as Vasudeva did at the time of Lord Kṛṣṇa’s appearance.

### Translation

**In outer space all the demigods, including the inhabitants of Gandharvaloka, Siddhaloka and Cāraṇaloka, offered their prayers and danced to the accompaniment of music, songs and the beating of drums. Similarly, in Navadvīpa city all the professional dancers, musicians and blessers gathered together, dancing in great jubilation.**

### Purport

As there are professional singers, dancers and reciters of prayers in the heavenly planets, so in India still there are professional dancers, blessers and singers, all of whom assemble together during householder ceremonies, especially marriages and birth ceremonies. These professional men earn their livelihood by taking charity on such occasions from the homes of the Hindus. Eunuchs also take advantage of such ceremonies to receive charity. That is their means of livelihood. Such men never become servants or engage themselves in agriculture or business occupations; they simply take charity from neighborhood friends to maintain themselves peacefully. The *bhāṭas* are a class of *brāhmaṇas* who go to such ceremonies to offer blessings by composing poems with references to the Vedic scriptures.

### Translation

**The wife of Śrīvāsa Ṭhākura, whose name was Mālinī, accompanied by the wife of Candraśekhara \[Ācāryaratna\] and other ladies, came there in great happiness to worship the baby with paraphernalia such as vermilion, turmeric, oil, fused rice, bananas and coconuts.**

### Purport

Vermilion, *kha-i* (fused rice), bananas, coconuts and turmeric mixed with oil are all auspicious gifts for such a ceremony. As there is puffed rice, so there is another preparation of rice called *kha-i,* or fused rice, which, along with bananas, is taken as a very auspicious presentation. Also, turmeric mixed with oil and vermilion makes an auspicious ointment that is smeared over the body of a newborn baby or a person who is going to marry. These are all auspicious activities in family affairs. We see that five hundred years ago at the birth of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu all these ceremonies were performed rigidly, but at present such ritualistic performances hardly ever take place. Generally a pregnant mother is sent to the hospital, and as soon as her child is born he is washed with an antiseptic, and this concludes everything.

### Purport

It appears that Advaita Ācārya had two different houses, one at Śāntipura and one at Navadvīpa. When Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu was born, Advaita Ācārya was residing not at His Navadvīpa house but at His Śāntipura house. Therefore, as formerly explained (text 99), from Advaita’s old paternal house (*nijālaya*) in Śāntipura, Sītā came to Navadvīpa to present gifts to the newborn child, Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

**There were also tiger nails set in gold, waist decorations of silk and lace, ornaments for the hands and legs, nicely printed silken saris, and a child’s garment, also made of silk. Many other riches, including gold and silver coins, were also presented to the child.**

### Purport

From the gifts presented by Sītā Ṭhākurāṇī, Advaita Ācārya’s wife, it appears that Advaita Ācārya was at that time a very rich man. Although *brāhmaṇas* are not the rich men of society, Advaita Ācārya, being the leader of the *brāhmaṇas* in Śāntipura, was considerably well-to-do. Therefore He presented many ornaments to the baby, Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. But Kamalākānta Viśvāsa’s asking for three hundred rupees from the King of Jagannātha Purī, Mahārāja Pratāparudra, on the plea that Advaita Ācārya was in debt for that amount, indicates that such a rich man, who could present many valuable ornaments, saris, etc., thought it difficult to repay three hundred rupees. Therefore the value of a rupee at that time was many thousands of times what it is now. At present, no one feels difficulty over a debt of three hundred rupees, nor can an ordinary man accumulate such valuable ornaments to present to a friend’s son. Probably the value of three hundred rupees at that time was equal to the present value of thirty thousand rupees.

### Purport

The words *vastra-gupta dolā* are very significant in this verse. Even fifty or sixty years ago in Calcutta, all respectable ladies would go to a neighboring place riding on a palanquin carried by four men. The palanquin was covered with soft cotton, and in that way there was no chance of seeing a respectable lady traveling in public. Ladies, especially those coming from respectable families, could not be seen by ordinary men. This system is still current in remote places. The Sanskrit word *asūrya-paśyā* indicates that a respectable lady could not be seen even by the sun. In the oriental culture this system was very prevalent and was strictly observed by respectable ladies, both Hindu and Muslim. We have actual experience in our childhood that our mother would not walk even next door to observe an invitation; rather, she would go in either a carriage or a palanquin carried by four men. This custom was also strictly followed five hundred years ago, and the wife of Advaita Ācārya, being a very respectable lady, observed the customary rules current in that social environment.

### Purport

A *peṭāri* is a kind of big basket that is carried in pairs on the ends of a rod balanced over the shoulders. The man who carries such a load is called a *bhārī.* This system of carrying luggage and packages is still current in India and other oriental countries, and we have seen that the same system is still current even in Jakarta, Indonesia.

### Purport

Ḍākinī and Śāṅkhinī are two companions of Lord Śiva and his wife who are supposed to be extremely inauspicious, having been born of ghostly life. It is believed that such inauspicious living creatures cannot go near a *nima* tree. At least medically it is accepted that *nima* wood is extremely antiseptic, and formerly it was customary to have a *nima* tree in front of one’s house. On very large roads in India, especially in Uttar Pradesh, there are hundreds and thousands of *nima* trees. *Nima* wood is so antiseptic that the Āyurvedic science uses it to cure leprosy. Medical scientists have extracted the active principle of the *nima* tree, which is called margosic acid. *Nima* is used for many purposes, especially to brush the teeth. In Indian villages ninety percent of the people use *nima* twigs for this purpose. Because of all the antiseptic effects of the *nima* tree and because Lord Caitanya was born beneath a *nima* tree, Sītā Ṭhākurāṇī gave the Lord the name Nimāi. Later in His youth He was celebrated as Nimāi Paṇḍita, and in the neighborhood villages He was called by that name, although His real name was Viśvambhara.

Then Sītā Ṭhākurāṇī, being honored by mother Śacīdevī and Jagannātha Miśra, was greatly happy within her mind, and thus she returned home.**

### Purport

On the fifth day from the birth of a child, as also on the ninth day, the mother bathes either in the Ganges or in another sacred place. This is called *niṣkrāmaṇa,* or the ceremony of coming out of the maternity home. Nowadays the maternity home is a hospital, but formerly in every respectable house one room was set aside as a maternity home where children would take birth, and on the ninth day after the birth of a child the mother would come into the regular rooms in the ceremony called *niṣkrāmaṇa.* Of the ten purificatory processes, *niṣkrāmaṇa* is one. Formerly, especially in Bengal, the higher castes observed four months after the birth of a child as a quarantine. At the end of the fourth month, the mother could see the sun rise. Later the higher castes, namely the *brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas* and *vaiśyas,* observed only twenty-one days as a quarantine, whereas the *śūdras* had to observe thirty days. For the sections of society known as *kartābhajā* and *satīmā,* the mother of the child was immediately purified after the quarantine by the throwing of *hari-nuṭa,* small pieces of sweetmeat, in *saṅkīrtana.* Śacīdevī and Jagannātha Miśra, with the newborn child, were honored by Sītā Ṭhākurāṇī. Similarly, while Sītā Ṭhākurāṇī was returning home, she was also honored by Śacīdevī and Jagannātha Miśra. That was the system in respectable families of Bengal.

पाइय़ा मानुष जन्म, ये ना शुने गौरगुण,  
हेन जन्म तार व्यर्थ हैल ।  
पाइय़ा अमृतधुनी, पिय़े वियगर्त–पानि,

### Verse text

*pāiyā mānuṣa janma,* *ye nā śune gaura-guṇa,  
hena janma tāra vyartha haila  
pāiyā amṛtadhunī,* *piye viṣa-garta-pāni,  
janmiyā se kene nāhi maila*

### Synonyms

*pāiyā* *mānuṣa* *janma* — anyone who has gotten the form of a human body; *ye* — who; *nā* — does not; *śune* — hear; *gaura*-*guṇa* — the qualities of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu; *hena* *janma* — such a birth; *tāra* — his; *vyartha* *haila* — becomes useless; *pāiyā* — getting the opportunity; *amṛtadhunī* — of the river of nectar; *piye* — drinks; *viṣa*-*garta*-*pāni* — water in a poison pit of material happiness; *janmiyā* — taking birth as a human being; *se* — he; *kene* — why; *nāhi* — did not; *maila* — die.

### Translation

**Anyone who attains a human body but does not take to the cult of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is baffled in his opportunity. Amṛtadhunī is a flowing river of the nectar of devotional service. If after getting a human body one drinks the water in a poison pit of material happiness instead of the water of such a river, it would be better for him not to have lived, but to have died long ago.**

### Purport

In this connection Śrīmat Prabodhānanda Sarasvatī has composed the following verses in his *Caitanya-candrāmṛta* (37, 36, 34):

*acaitanyam idaṁ viśvaṁ* *yadi caitanyam īśvaram  
na viduḥ sarva-śāstra-jñā* *hy api bhrāmyanti te janāḥ*

“This material world is without Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu is Kṛṣṇa consciousness personified. Therefore if a very learned scholar or scientist does not understand Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, certainly he is wandering uselessly in this world.”

*prasārita-mahā-prema-* *pīyūṣa-rasa-sāgare  
caitanya-candre prakaṭe* *yo dīno dīna eva saḥ*

“A person who does not take advantage of the nectar of devotional service overflowing during the presence of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s cult is certainly the poorest of the poor.”

*avatīrṇe gaura-candre* *vistīrṇe prema-sāgare  
suprakāśita-ratnaughe* *yo dīno dīna eva saḥ*

“The advent of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu is just like an expanding ocean of nectar. One who does not collect the valuable jewels within this ocean is certainly the poorest of the poor.”

Similarly, *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (2.3.19, 20, 23) states:

*śva-viḍ-varāhoṣṭra-kharaiḥ*  
 *saṁstutaḥ puruṣaḥ paśuḥ  
na yat-karṇa-pathopeto*  
 *jātu nāma gadāgrajaḥ*

*bile batorukrama-vikramān ye *
 *na śṛṇvataḥ karṇa-puṭe narasya  
jihvāsatī dārdurikeva sūta *
 *na copagāyaty urugāya-gāthāḥ*

*jīvañ chavo bhāgavatāṅghri-reṇuṁ *
 *na jātu martyo ’bhilabheta yas tu  
śrī-viṣṇu-padyā manujas tulasyāḥ *
 *śvasañ chavo yas tu na veda gandham*

“A person who has no connection with Kṛṣṇa consciousness may be a very great personality in so-called human society, but actually he is no better than a great animal. Such big animals are generally praised by other animals like dogs, hogs camels and asses. A person who does not lend his aural reception to hearing about the Supreme Personality of Godhead must be considered to have earholes like holes in a field. Although that person has a tongue, it is like the tongue of a frog, which unnecessarily creates a disturbance by croaking, inviting the snake of death. Similarly, a person who neither takes advantage of the dust of the lotus feet of great devotees nor smells the *tulasī* leaves offered to the lotus feet of the Lord must be considered dead even though he is supposedly working.”

Similarly, *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* 10.1.4 states:

*nivṛtta-tarṣair upagīyamānād *
 *bhavauṣadhāc chrotra-mano-’bhirāmāt  
ka uttamaśloka-guṇānuvādāt *
 *pumān virajyeta vinā paśu-ghnāt*

“Who but the animal-killer or the killer of the soul will not care to hear glorification of the Supreme Personality of Godhead? Such glorification is enjoyed by persons liberated from the contamination of this material world.”

Similarly, *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* 3.23.56 says, *na tīrtha-pada-sevāyai jīvann api mṛto hi saḥ:* “Although a person is apparently living, if he does not serve the lotus feet of great devotees he is to be considered a dead body.”

### Synonyms

*śrī*-*caitanya*-*nityānanda* — Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and Nityānanda Prabhu; *ācārya* *advaitacandra* — Ācārya Śrī Advaitacandra; *svarūpa*-*rūpa*-*raghunāthadāsa* — Svarūpa Dāmodara, Rūpa Gosvāmī and Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī; *iṅhā*-*sabāra* — of all of them; *śrī*-*caraṇa* — the lotus feet; *śire* — on the head; *vandi* — offering respect; *nija*-*dhana* — personal property; *janma*-*līlā* — narration of the birth; *gāila* — sang; *kṛṣṇadāsa* — Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī.

### Translation

**Taking on my head as my own property the lotus feet of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Nityānanda Prabhu, Ācārya Advaitacandra, Svarūpa Dāmodara, Rūpa Gosvāmī and Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī, I, Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī, have thus described the advent of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.**

### Purport

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Nityānanda, Advaita Prabhu, Svarūpa Dāmodara, Rūpa Gosvāmī, Raghunātha dāsa and their followers are all accepted by Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī. Anyone who follows in the footsteps of Kavirāja Gosvāmī also accepts the lotus feet of the above-mentioned lords as his personal property. For a materialistic person, material wealth and opulence are only illusory. Actually they are not possessions but entanglements because by enjoying the material world a conditioned soul becomes more and more entangled by incurring debts for his present enjoyment. Unfortunately, a conditioned soul considers property for which he is in debt to be his own, and he is very busy acquiring such property. But a devotee considers such property not real property but simply an entanglement in the material world. If Lord Kṛṣṇa is very pleased with a devotee, He takes away his material property, as He states in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (10.88.8): *yasyāham anugṛhṇāmi hariṣye tad-dhanaṁ śanaiḥ. “*To show special favor to a devotee, I take away all his material property.” Similarly, Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura says:

*dhana mora nityānanda,* *rādhā-kṛṣṇa-śrīcaraṇa  
sei mora prāṇadhana*

“My real riches are Nityānanda Prabhu and the lotus feet of Śrī Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa.” He further prays, “O Lord, kindly give me this opulence. I do not want anything but Your lotus feet as my property.” Śrīla Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura has sung in many places that his real property is the lotus feet of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa. Unfortunately, we are interested in unreal property and are neglecting our real property (*adhane yatana kari’ dhana teyāginu*).

Sometimes *smārtas* consider Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī a *śūdra.* But Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī here especially mentions *svarūpa-rūpa-raghunāthadāsa.* Therefore one who considers the lotus feet of Raghunātha dāsa to be transcendental to all divisions of the caste system enjoys the riches of actual spiritual bliss.

*Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports to* Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta, Ādi-līlā, *thirteenth chapter, describing the advent of Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.*
