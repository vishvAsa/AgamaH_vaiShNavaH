title = "12 The Loving Dealings Between Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and Jagadānanda Paṇḍita"
+++
CHAPTER TWELVE

A summary of the twelfth chapter is given by Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura in his *Amṛta-pravāha-bhāṣya* as follows. This chapter discusses the transformations of ecstatic love that Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu exhibited day and night. The devotees from Bengal again journeyed to Jagannātha Purī to see Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. As usual, the leader was Śivānanda Sena, who traveled with his wife and children. Because arrangements were delayed en route and Lord Nityānanda did not have a suitable place to reside, He became somewhat disturbed. Thus He became very angry with Śivānanda Sena, who was in charge of the affairs of the party, and kicked him in loving anger. Śivānanda Sena felt highly favored to have been kicked by Nityānanda Prabhu, but his nephew Śrīkānta Sena became upset and therefore left their company. He met Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu at Jagannātha Purī before the rest of the party arrived.

That year a devotee named Parameśvara dāsa Modaka also went with his family to see Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu at Jagannātha Purī. The devotees often invited Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu to eat with them. When the Lord bade them all farewell, He talked very pleasingly with them. The year before, Jagadānanda Paṇḍita had been sent to Śacīmātā with *prasādam* and cloth. This year he returned to Purī with a big pot of floral-scented sandalwood oil to massage the Lord’s head. The Lord, however, would not accept the oil, and because of His refusal, Jagadānanda Paṇḍita broke the pot in front of Him and began to fast. The Lord tried to pacify him and asked Jagadānanda Paṇḍita to cook for Him. Jagadānanda Paṇḍita became so pleased when Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu accepted his cooking that he broke his fast.

*ghṛtaṁ ca sārṣapaṁ tailaṁ* *yat tailaṁ puṣpa-vāsitam

### Purport

The word *vivarta* means accepting something to be the opposite of what it appears. Here, Jagadānanda Paṇḍita appeared very angry, but this anger was a manifestation of his great love for Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. *Prema-vivarta* is also the name of a book written by Jagadānanda Paṇḍita. Therefore the author of *Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta,* Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī, uses the words *prema-vivarta* to refer to one who reads the book or hears about Jagadānanda Paṇḍita’s loving dealings with Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. In either case, such a person very soon achieves love of Kṛṣṇa.
