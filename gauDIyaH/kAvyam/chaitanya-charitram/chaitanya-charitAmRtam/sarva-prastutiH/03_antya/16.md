CHAPTER SIXTEEN

The sixteenth chapter is summarized by Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura in his *Amṛta-pravāha-bhāṣya.* When the Bengali devotees of the Lord returned to Jagannātha Purī, a gentleman named Kālidāsa, who was an uncle of Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī, went with them to see Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Kālidāsa had tasted the remnants of food of all the Vaiṣṇavas in Bengal, even Jhaḍu Ṭhākura. Because of this, he received the shelter of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu at Jagannātha Purī.

When Kavi-karṇapūra was only seven years old, he was initiated by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu into the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra.* He later became the greatest poet among the Vaiṣṇava *ācāryas.*

When Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu ate the remnants of food known as *vallabha-bhoga,* He described the glories of such remnants of the Lord’s food and then fed all the devotees the *prasādam.* Thus they all tasted *adharāmṛta,* the nectar from the lips of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa.

### Translation

### Purport

In this connection Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura warns the men of this age not to imitate the jesting of a *mahā-bhāgavata* like Kālidāsa. If someone imitates him by playing with dice or gambling while chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra,* he will certainly become a victim of offenses unto the holy name. As it is said, *hari-nāma-bale pāpe pravṛtti:* one must not commit sinful activities on the strength of chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra.* Playing with dice is certainly gambling, but it is clearly said here that Kālidāsa did this only in jest. A *mahā-bhāgavata* can do anything, but he never forgets the basic principles. Therefore it is said, *tāṅra vākya, kriyā-mudrā vijñeha nā bujhaya:* “No one can understand the activities of a pure devotee.” We should not imitate Kālidāsa.

Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura remarks, “Both Kālidāsa and Jhaḍu Ṭhākura are worshiped at a place called Śrīpāṭabāṭī, in the village known as Bhedo or Bhaduyā. This village is situated about three miles south of the village of Kṛṣṇapura, the birthplace of Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī, which is about one mile west of the Bandel junction of the Burdwan line. A post office there is named Devānanda-pura. Jhaḍu Ṭhākura used to worship the Deity of Śrī Madana-gopāla. The Deity is still worshiped by one Rāmaprasāda dāsa, who belongs to the Rāmāyet community. It is said that the Deity worshiped by Kālidāsa had been worshiped until recently in the village of Śaṅkha on the bank of the Sarasvatī River, but the Deity was taken away by a gentleman named Matilāla Caṭṭopādhyāya from the village of Triveṇī. The Deity is now being worshiped at his place.”

Simply to take birth in a brāhmaṇa family or to have brahminical qualities is not sufficient. One must become a pure devotee of the Lord. If a śva-paca or caṇḍāla is a devotee, he delivers not only himself but his whole family, whereas a brāhmaṇa who is not a devotee but simply has brahminical qualifications cannot even purify himself, what to speak of his family.’**

Although he may be born in a family of dog-eaters and therefore, by material calculations, be the lowest of men, he is glorious nevertheless. That is the wonderful power of chanting the holy name of the Lord. One who chants the holy name is understood to have performed all kinds of austerities. He has studied all the Vedas, he has performed all the great sacrifices mentioned in the Vedas, and he has already taken his bath in all the holy places of pilgrimage. It is he who is factually the Āryan.’ ”**

### Translation

**“Such a position may befit others, but I do not possess such spiritual power. I belong to a lower class and have not even a pinch of devotion to Kṛṣṇa.”**

### Purport

In his statement, Jhaḍu Ṭhākura presents himself as being born in a low-caste family and not having the qualifications of a bona fide devotee of Lord Kṛṣṇa. He accepts the statements declaring a lowborn person highly exalted if he is a Vaiṣṇava. However, he feels that these descriptions from *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* appropriately describe others, but not himself. Jhaḍu Ṭhākura’s attitude is quite befitting a real Vaiṣṇava, for a Vaiṣṇava never considers himself exalted, even if he factually is. He is always meek and humble and never thinks that he is an advanced devotee. He assigns himself to a lower position, but that does not mean he is indeed low. Sanātana Gosvāmī once said that he belonged to a low-caste family, for although he was born in a *brāhmaṇa* family, he had associated with *mlecchas* and *yavanas* in his service as a government minister. Similarly, Jhaḍu Ṭhākura presented himself as someone who belonged to a low caste, but he was actually elevated above many persons born in *brāhmaṇa* families. Not only is there evidence for this in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,* as quoted by Kālidāsa in verses 26 and 27, but there is also considerable evidence for this conclusion in other *śāstras.* For example, in the *Mahābhārata* (*Vana-parva,* chapter 177, verse 20), it is stated:

*śūdre tu yad bhavel lakṣma* *dvije tac ca na vidyate  
na vai śūdro bhavec chūdro* *brāhmaṇo na ca brāhmaṇaḥ*

“If someone born a *śūdra* possesses the characteristics of a *brāhmaṇa* and someone born a *brāhmaṇa* does not, that *śūdra* should not be known as a *śūdra,* and that *brāhmaṇa* should not be known as a *brāhmaṇa.*”

Similarly, in the *Vana-parva,* chapter 203, verses 11-12, it is said:

*śūdra-yonau hi jātasya* *sad-guṇānupatiṣṭhataḥ  
ārjave vartamānasya* *brāhmaṇyam abhijāyate*

“If a person born in a *śūdra* family has developed the qualities of a *brāhmaṇa,* such as *satya* \[truthfulness\], *śama* \[peacefulness\], *dama* \[self-control\] and *ārjava* \[simplicity\], he attains the exalted position of a *brāhmaṇa.*”

And in the *Anuśāsana-parva,* chapter 163, it is said:

*sthito brāhmaṇa-dharmeṇa* *brāhmaṇyam upajīvati  
kṣatriyo vātha vaiśyo vā* *brahma-bhūyaḥ sa gacchati*

*ebhis tu karmabhir devi* *śubhair ācaritais tathā  
śūdro brāhmaṇatāṁ yāti* *vaiśyaḥ kṣatriyatāṁ vrajet*

*na yonir nāpi saṁskāro* *na śrutaṁ na ca santatiḥ  
kāraṇāni dvijatvasya* *vṛttam eva tu kāraṇam*

“If one is factually situated in the occupation of a *brāhmaṇa,* he must be considered a *brāhmaṇa,* even if born in a *kṣatriya* or *vaiśya* family. O Devī, even if one is born a *śūdra,* if he is actually engaged in the occupation and pure behavior of a *brāhmaṇa,* he becomes a *brāhmaṇa.* Moreover, a *vaiśya* can become a *kṣatriya.* Therefore, neither the source of one’s birth nor his reformation nor his education is the criterion of a *brāhmaṇa.* The *vṛtta,* or occupation, is the real standard by which one is known as a *brāhmaṇa.*”

We have seen that a person who is not the son of a doctor and has not attended a medical college is sometimes able to practice medicine. By practical knowledge of how to perform a surgical operation, how to mix medicine and how to give certain medicines for certain diseases, a person can receive a certificate and be registered as a medical practitioner in the practical field. He can do a medical man’s work and be known as a doctor. Although qualified medical men may consider him a quack, the government will recognize his work. Especially in India, there are many such doctors who perform their medical services perfectly. They are accepted even by the government. Similarly, if one is engaged in brahminical service or occupational duties, he must be considered a *brāhmaṇa* despite the family in which he is born. That is the verdict of all the *śāstras.*

In *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (7.11.35), it is said:

*yasya yal lakṣaṇaṁ proktaṁ* *puṁso varṇābhivyañjakam  
yad anyatrāpi dṛśyeta* *tat tenaiva vinirdiśet*

This is a statement by Nārada Muni to Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira, wherein Nārada says that the symptoms of a *brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya* and *vaiśya* are all described in the *śāstra.* Therefore, if one is found exhibiting the symptoms and qualities of a *brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya* or *vaiśya* and serving in a brahminical, *kṣatriya* or *vaiśya* occupation, even if he is not born a *brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya* or *vaiśya* he should be considered such according to his qualifications and occupation.

Similarly, in the *Padma purāṇa* it is said:

*na śūdrā bhagavad-bhaktās* *te tu bhāgavatā matāḥ  
sarva-varṇeṣu te śūdrā* *ye na bhaktā janārdane*

“A devotee should never be considered a *śūdra.* All the devotees of the Supreme Personality of Godhead should be recognized as *bhāgavatas.* If one is not a devotee of Lord Kṛṣṇa, however, even if born in a *brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya* or *vaiśya* family, he should be considered a *śūdra.*”

In the *Padma Purāṇa* it is also said:

*śva-pākam iva nekṣeta* *loke vipram avaiṣṇavam  
vaiṣṇavo varṇo-bāhyo ’pi* *punāti bhuvana-trayam*

“If a person born in a *brāhmaṇa* family is an *avaiṣṇava,* a nondevotee, one should not see his face, exactly as one should not look upon the face of a *caṇḍāla,* or dog-eater. However, a Vaiṣṇava found in *varṇas* other than *brāhmaṇa* can purify all the three worlds.”

The *Padma Purāṇa* further says:

*śūdraṁ vā bhagavad-bhaktaṁ* *niṣādaṁ śva-pacaṁ tathā  
vīkṣate jāti-sāmānyāt* *sa yāti narakaṁ dhruvam*

“One who considers a devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead who was born in a family of *śūdras, niṣādas* or *caṇḍālas* to belong to that particular caste certainly goes to hell.”

A *brāhmaṇa* must be a Vaiṣṇava and a learned scholar. Therefore in India it is customary to address a *brāhmaṇa* as *paṇḍita.* Without knowledge of Brahman, one cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore a Vaiṣṇava is already a *brāhmaṇa,* whereas a *brāhmaṇa* may become a Vaiṣṇava. In the *Garuḍa Purāṇa* it is said:

*bhaktir aṣṭa-vidhā hy eṣā* *yasmin mlecche ’pi vartate  
sa viprendro muni-śreṣṭhaḥ* *sa jñānī sa ca paṇḍitaḥ*

“Even if one is born a *mleccha,* if he becomes a devotee he is to be considered the best of the *brāhmaṇas* and a learned *paṇḍita.*”

Similarly, the *Tattva-sāgara* says:

*yathā kāñcanatāṁ yāti* *kāṁsyaṁ rasa-vidhānataḥ  
tathā dīkṣā-vidhānena* *dvijatvaṁ jāyate nṛṇām*

“As bell metal is turned to gold when mixed with mercury in an alchemical process, so one who is properly trained and initiated by a bona fide spiritual master becomes a *brāhmaṇa* immediately.” All this evidence found in the revealed scriptures proves that according to the Vedic version, a Vaiṣṇava is never to be considered an *abrāhmaṇa,* or non-*brāhmaṇa.* A Vaiṣṇava should not be thought to belong to a lower caste even if born in a *mleccha* or *yavana* family. Because he has become a devotee of Lord Kṛṣṇa, he has become purified and has attained the stage of *brāhmaṇa* (*dvijatvaṁ jāyate nṛṇām*)*.*
