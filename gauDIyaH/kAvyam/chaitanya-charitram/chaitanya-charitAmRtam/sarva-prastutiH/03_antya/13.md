CHAPTER THIRTEEN

Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura gives the following summary of the thirteenth chapter in his *Amṛta-pravāha-bhāṣya.* Thinking Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was uncomfortable sleeping on bark of plantain trees, Jagadānanda made a pillow and quilt for Him. The Lord, however, did not accept them. Then Svarūpa Dāmodara Gosvāmī made another pillow and quilt from finely shredded plantain leaves, and after strongly objecting, the Lord accepted them. With the permission of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Jagadānanda Paṇḍita went to Vṛndāvana, where he discussed many devotional subjects with Sanātana Gosvāmī. There was also a discussion about Mukunda Sarasvatī’s garment. When Jagadānanda returned to Jagannātha Purī, he presented Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu with some gifts from Sanātana Gosvāmī, and the incident of the *pīlu* fruit took place.

Once, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu became ecstatic upon hearing the songs of a *deva-dāsī.* Unaware of who was singing, He ran toward her through thorny bushes, but when Govinda informed the Lord that it was a woman singing, He immediately stopped. By this incident, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu instructed everyone that *sannyāsīs* and Vaiṣṇavas should not hear women singing.

When Raghunātha Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmī left Vārāṇasī on his way to Jagannātha Purī after completing his education, he met Rāmadāsa Viśvāsa Paṇḍita. Viśvāsa Paṇḍita was very proud of his education, and being an impersonalist, he was not well received by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. A summary of the life of Raghunātha Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmī ends this chapter.

### Translation

**“Do not mix freely with the residents of Mathurā; show them respect from a distance. Because you are on a different platform of devotional service, you cannot adopt their behavior and practices.**

### Purport

The residents of Vṛndāvana and Mathurā are devotees of Kṛṣṇa in parental affection, and their feelings always conflict with the opinions of *smārta-brāhmaṇas.* Devotees who worship Kṛṣṇa in opulence cannot understand the parental devotional feelings of the residents of Mathurā and Vṛndāvana, who follow the path of spontaneous love. Devotees on the platform of *vidhi-mārga* (regulative devotional principles) may misunderstand the activities of those on the platform of *rāga-mārga* (devotional service in spontaneous love). Therefore Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu instructed Jagadānanda Paṇḍita to remain apart from the residents of Vṛndāvana, who were spontaneous devotees, so as not to become disrespectful toward them.

### Translation

**“You should remain in Vṛndāvana for only a short time and then return here as soon as possible. Also, do not climb Govardhana Hill to see the Gopāla Deity.**

### Purport

In his *Amṛta-pravāha-bhāṣya,* Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura advises that one avoid remaining in Vṛndāvana for a very long time. As the saying goes, “Familiarity breeds contempt.” If one stays in Vṛndāvana for many days, he may fail to maintain proper respect for its inhabitants. Therefore those who have not attained the stage of spontaneous love for Kṛṣṇa should not live in Vṛndāvana very long. It is better for them to make short visits. One should also avoid climbing Govardhana Hill to see the Gopāla Deity. Since Govardhana Hill itself is identical with Gopāla, one should not step on the hill or touch it with his feet. One may see Gopāla when He goes elsewhere.

### Translation

**“This saffron cloth is unfit for a Vaiṣṇava to wear; therefore I have no use for it. I shall give it to a stranger.”**

### Purport

Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura comments on this incident as follows: Vaiṣṇavas are all liberated persons, unattached to anything material. Therefore a Vaiṣṇava need not accept the dress of a *sannyāsī* to prove his exalted position. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu accepted the renounced order from a *sannyāsī* of the Māyāvāda school. Present-day Vaiṣṇava *sannyāsīs,* however, never think that by accepting the dress of the *sannyāsa* order they have become equal to Caitanya Mahāprabhu. In fact, a Vaiṣṇava accepts the *sannyāsa* order to remain an eternal servant of his spiritual master. He accepts the *sannyāsa* order knowing that he is unequal to his spiritual master, who is a *paramahaṁsa,* and he thinks that he is unfit to dress like a *paramahaṁsa.* Therefore a Vaiṣṇava accepts *sannyāsa* out of humility, not out of pride.

Sanātana Gosvāmī had adopted the dress of a *paramahaṁsa;* therefore it was inappropriate for him to wear the saffron cloth on his head. However, a Vaiṣṇava *sannyāsī* does not think himself fit to imitate the dress of a *paramahaṁsa* Vaiṣṇava. According to the principles set down by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu (*tṛṇād api su-nīcena*), one should always think himself in the lowest stage, not on the level of a *paramahaṁsa* Vaiṣṇava. Thus a Vaiṣṇava will sometimes accept the *sannyāsa* order just to keep himself below the level of a *paramahaṁsa* Vaiṣṇava. This is the instruction of Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura.

*aṣṭa*-*māsa* — for eight months; *rahi’* — staying; *prabhu* — Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu; *bhaṭṭe* — to Raghunātha Bhaṭṭa; *vidāya* *dilā* — bid farewell; *vivāha* *nā* *kariha* — do not marry; *bali’* — saying; *niṣedha* *karilā* — he forbade.

### Translation

**After eight months, when Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu bade farewell to Raghunātha Bhaṭṭa, the Lord flatly forbade him to marry. “Do not marry,” the Lord said.**

### Purport

Raghunātha Bhaṭṭācārya had become a greatly advanced devotee while still unmarried. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu could see this, and therefore He advised him not to begin the process of material sense gratification. Marriage is a concession for people who are unable to control their senses. Raghunātha, however, being an advanced devotee of Kṛṣṇa, naturally had no desire for sense gratification. Therefore Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu advised him not to enter the bondage of marriage. Generally a person cannot make much advancement in spiritual consciousness if he is married. He becomes attached to his family and is prone to sense gratification. Thus his spiritual advancement is very slow or almost nil.

### Translation

**Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu said to Raghunātha Bhaṭṭa, “When you return home, serve your aged father and mother, who are devotees, and try to study Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam from a pure Vaiṣṇava who has realized God.”**

### Purport

One should note how Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, advised Raghunātha Bhaṭṭācārya to learn *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.* He advised him to understand *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* not from professional men but from a real *bhāgavata,* a devotee. He also advised Raghunātha Bhaṭṭa to serve his mother and father because they were both Lord Caitanya’s devotees. Anyone who wishes to advance in Kṛṣṇa consciousness must try to serve the devotees of Kṛṣṇa. As Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura says, *chāḍiyā vaiṣṇava-sevā nistāra peyeche kebā:* “Without serving a self-realized Vaiṣṇava, no one has ever been released from the materialistic way of life.” Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu would have never advised Raghunātha Bhaṭṭa to serve ordinary parents, but since his parents were Vaiṣṇavas, the Lord advised him to serve them.

One might ask, “Why shouldn’t ordinary parents be served?” As stated in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (5.5.18):

*gurur na sa syāt sva-jano na sa syāt *
 *pitā na sa syāj jananī na sā syāt  
daivaṁ na tat syāt na patiś ca sa syān *
 *na mocayed yaḥ samupeta-mṛtyum*

“One who cannot deliver his dependent from the path of birth and death should never become a spiritual master, a relative, a father or mother, or a worshipable demigod, nor should such a person become a husband.” Everyone naturally gets a father and mother at the time of birth, but the real father and mother are those who can release their offspring from the clutches of imminent death. This is possible only for parents advanced in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Therefore any parents who cannot enlighten their offspring in Kṛṣṇa consciousness cannot be accepted as a real father and mother. The following verse from the *Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu* (1.2.200) confirms the uselessness of serving ordinary parents:

*laukikī vaidikī vāpi* *yā kriyā kriyate mune  
hari-sevānukūlaiva* *sa kāryā bhaktim icchatā*

“One should perform only those activities — either worldly or prescribed by Vedic rules and regulations — which are favorable for the cultivation of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.”

Concerning the study of *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,* Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu clearly advises that one avoid hearing from a non-Vaiṣṇava professional reciter. In this connection Sanātana Gosvāmī quotes a verse from the *Padma Purāṇa:*

*avaiṣṇava-mukhodgīrṇaṁ* *pūtaṁ hari-kathāmṛtam  
śravaṇaṁ naiva kartavyaṁ* *sarpocchiṣṭaṁ yathā payaḥ*

“No one should hear or take lessons from a person who is not a Vaiṣṇava. Even if he speaks about Kṛṣṇa, such a lesson should not be accepted, for it is like milk touched by the lips of a serpent.” Nowadays it is fashionable to observe Bhāgavata-saptāha and hear *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* from persons who are anything but advanced devotees or self-realized souls. There are even many Māyāvādīs who read *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* to throngs of people. Many Māyāvādīs have recently begun reciting *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* in Vṛndāvana, and because they can present the *Bhāgavatam* with word jugglery, twisting the meaning by grammatical tricks, materialistic persons who go to Vṛndāvana as a matter of spiritual fashion like to hear them. All this is clearly forbidden by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. We should note carefully that since these Māyāvādīs cannot personally know the meaning of *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,* they can never deliver others by reciting it. On the other hand, an advanced devotee of the Lord is free from material bondage. He personifies *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* in life and action. Therefore we advise that anyone who wants to learn *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* must approach such a realized soul.

### Translation

**He would not listen to blasphemy of a Vaiṣṇava, nor would he listen to talk of a Vaiṣṇava’s misbehavior. He knew only that everyone was engaged in Kṛṣṇa’s service; he did not understand anything else.**

### Purport

Raghunātha Bhaṭṭa never did anything harmful to a Vaiṣṇava. In other words, he was never inattentive in the service of the Lord, nor did he ever violate the rules and regulations of a pure Vaiṣṇava. It is the duty of a Vaiṣṇava *ācārya* to prevent his disciples and followers from violating the principles of Vaiṣṇava behavior. He should always advise them to strictly follow the regulative principles, which will protect them from falling down. Although a Vaiṣṇava preacher may sometimes criticize others, Raghunātha Bhaṭṭa avoided this. Even if another Vaiṣṇava was actually at fault, Raghunātha Bhaṭṭa would not criticize him; he saw only that everyone was engaged in Kṛṣṇa’s service. That is the position of a *mahā-bhāgavata.* Actually, even if one is serving *māyā,* in a higher sense he is also a servant of Kṛṣṇa. Because *māyā* is the servant of Kṛṣṇa, anyone serving *māyā* serves Kṛṣṇa indirectly. Therefore it is said:

*keha māne, keha nā māne, saba tāṅra dāsa  
ye nā māne, tāra haya sei pāpe nāśa*

“Some accept Him, whereas others do not, yet everyone is His servant. One who does not accept Him, however, will be ruined by his sinful activities.” (Cc. *Ādi* 6.85)
