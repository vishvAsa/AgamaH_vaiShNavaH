CHAPTER SIX

A summary of this chapter is given by Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura in his *Amṛta-pravāha-bhāṣya* as follows. When Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu went into transcendental fits of ecstatic love, Rāmānanda Rāya and Svarūpa Dāmodara Gosvāmī attended to Him and satisfied Him as He desired. Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī had been attempting to come to the lotus feet of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu for a long time, and finally he left his home and met the Lord. When Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu had gone to Śāntipura on His way to Vṛndāvana, Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī had offered to dedicate his life at the Lord’s lotus feet. In the meantime, however, a Muslim official became envious of Hiraṇya dāsa, Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī’s uncle, and induced some big official court minister to have him arrested. Thus Hiraṇya dāsa left his home, but by the intelligence of Raghunātha dāsa the misunderstanding was mitigated. Then Raghunātha dāsa went to Pānihāṭi, and following the order of Nityānanda Prabhu, he observed a festival (*ciḍā-dadhi-mahotsava*) by distributing chipped rice mixed with yogurt. The day after the festival, Nityānanda Prabhu gave Raghunātha dāsa the blessing that he would very soon attain the shelter of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. After this incident, Raghunātha dāsa, with the help of his priest, whose name was Yadunandana Ācārya, got out of his house by trickery and thus ran away. Not touching the general path, Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī secretly went to Jagannātha Purī. After twelve days, he arrived in Jagannātha Purī at the lotus feet of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu entrusted Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī to Svarūpa Dāmodara Gosvāmī. Therefore another name for Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī is Svarūpera Raghu, or the Raghunātha of Svarūpa Dāmodara. For five days Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī took *prasādam* at the temple, but later he would stand at the Siṁha-dvāra gate and eat only whatever he could gather by alms. Later he lived by taking alms from various *chatras,* or food distributing centers. When Raghunātha’s father received news of this, he sent some men and money, but Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī refused to accept the money. Understanding that Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī was living by begging from the *chatras,* Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu presented him with His own *guñjā-mālā* and a stone from Govardhana Hill. Thereafter, Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī used to eat rejected food that he had collected and washed. This renounced life greatly pleased both Svarūpa Dāmodara Gosvāmī and Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. One day Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu took by force some of the same food, thus blessing Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī for his renunciation.

### Translation

**Indeed, the caudhurī was afraid of Raghunātha dāsa because Raghunātha dāsa belonged to the kāyastha community. Although the caudhurī would chastise him with oral vibrations, he was afraid to beat him.**

### Purport

Raghunātha dāsa belonged to a very aristocratic family of the *kāyastha* community. He had substantial influence with the local people, and therefore the *caudhurī,* or minister, was afraid to beat him. Superficially he would chastise Raghunātha dāsa with threatening vibrations, but he did not beat him. The members of the *kāyastha* community in India are generally very intelligent and expert in business management. Formerly they were mostly government officers. They were mentioned even by Yājñavalkya, as quoted by Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura in his *Amṛta-pravāha-bhāṣya:*

*cāṭa-taskara-durvṛttair* *mahā-sāhasikādibhiḥ  
pīḍyamānā prajā rakṣet* *kāyasthaiś ca viśeṣataḥ*

From this verse it appears that the governmental officials of the *kāyastha* community would sometimes chastise the citizens, and thus it was the duty of the king to protect the people in general from the atrocities of the *kāyasthas.* In Bengal the *kāyastha* community is honored almost as much as the *brāhmaṇa* community, but in the up-country of India the *kāyasthas* are considered *śūdras* because they generally eat meat and drink wine. In any case, from history the *kāyasthas* appear very intelligent. Thus the Muslim *caudhurī* was afraid of Raghunātha dāsa because he belonged to the *kāyastha* community.

tomāre kāḍila viṣaya-viṣṭhā-garta haite”*

### Synonyms

*prabhu* *kahe* — Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu said; *kṛṣṇa*-*kṛpā* — the mercy of Lord Kṛṣṇa; *baliṣṭha* — more powerful; *sabā* *haite* — than anything; *tomāre* — you; *kāḍila* — He has delivered; *viṣaya* — of material enjoyment; *viṣṭhā* — of stool; *garta* — the ditch; *haite* — from.

### Translation

**Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, “The mercy of Lord Kṛṣṇa is stronger than anything else. Therefore the Lord has delivered you from the ditch of materialistic life, which is like a hole into which people pass stool.”**

### Purport

According to the law of *karma,* everyone is destined to suffer or enjoy according to a certain material standard, but the mercy of Lord Kṛṣṇa is so powerful that the Lord can change all the reactions of one’s past *karma,* or fruitive activities. Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu specifically drew attention to the mercy of Lord Kṛṣṇa. That mercy is more powerful than anything else, for it had saved Raghunātha dāsa from the strong bondage of materialistic life, which the Lord compared to a hole where people pass stool. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu gave His verdict that those addicted to the materialistic way of life are like worms that are living in stool but cannot give it up. A *gṛha-vrata,* one who has decided to live in a comfortable home although it is actually miserable, is in a condemned position. Only the mercy of Kṛṣṇa can save one from such misery. Without Kṛṣṇa’s mercy, one cannot get out of the filthy entanglement of materialistic life. The poor living entity cannot give up his materialistic position on his own; only when granted the special mercy of Kṛṣṇa can he give it up. Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu knew very well that Raghunātha dāsa was already liberated. Nevertheless He emphasized that Raghunātha dāsa’s life of material comfort as a very rich man’s son with a very beautiful wife and many servants to attend him was like a ditch of stool. The Lord thus specifically indicated that ordinary men who are very happy with material comforts and family life are in no better position than worms in stool.

*prabhu kahena, — “tomāra pitā-jyeṭhā dui jane

### Synonyms

*prabhu* *kahena* — Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu said; *tomāra* — your; *pitā*-*jyeṭhā* — father and his elder brother; *dui* *jane* — both of them; *cakravartī*-*sambandhe* — because of a relationship with Nīlāmbara Cakravartī; *hāma* — I; *ājā* *kari’* — as My grandfathers; *māne* — consider.

### Translation

**The Lord continued, “Your father and his elder brother are both related as brothers to My grandfather, Nīlāmbara Cakravartī. Therefore I consider them My grandfathers.**

### Purport

Nīlāmbara Cakravartī, the grandfather of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, was very intimately related to Raghunātha dāsa’s father and uncle. Nīlāmbara Cakravartī used to call them his younger brothers because both of them were very much devoted to the *brāhmaṇas* and were very respectable gentlemen. Similarly, they used to call him Dādā Cakravartī, addressing him as an elder brother *brāhmaṇa.* Raghunātha dāsa, however, was almost the same age as Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Generally a grandchild may joke about his grandfather. Therefore Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu took advantage of the relationship between His grandfather and Raghunātha dāsa’s father and uncle to speak in a joking way.

### Translation

**“My dear Raghunātha dāsa, your father and his elder brother are just like worms in stool in the ditch of material enjoyment, for the great disease of the poison of material enjoyment is what they consider happiness.**

### Purport

When a man is attached to material enjoyment, he is attached to many miserable conditions, but nevertheless he accepts his condemned position as one of happiness. Sense enjoyment is so strong for such a person that he cannot give it up, exactly as a worm in stool cannot give up the stool. From the spiritual point of view, when a person is too absorbed in material enjoyment, he is exactly like a worm in stool. Although such a position is utterly miserable to the eyes of liberated souls, the materialistic enjoyer is greatly attached to it.

### Verse text

yadyapi brahmaṇya kare brāhmaṇera sahāya  
‘śuddha-vaiṣṇava’ nahe, haye ‘vaiṣṇavera prāya’

### Synonyms

*yadyapi* — although; *brahmaṇya* *kare* — give charity to the *brāhmaṇas*; *brāhmaṇera* *sahāya* — great helpers to the *brāhmaṇas*; *śuddha*-*vaiṣṇava* — pure Vaiṣṇavas; *nahe* — not; *haye* — they are; *vaiṣṇavera* *prāya* — almost like Vaiṣṇavas.

### Translation

**“Although your father and uncle are charitable to brāhmaṇas and greatly help them, they are nevertheless not pure Vaiṣṇavas. However, they are almost like Vaiṣṇavas.**

### Purport

As stated by Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura in his *Amṛta-pravāha-bhāṣya,* some people, usually very rich men, dress like Vaiṣṇavas and give charity to *brāhmaṇas.* They are also attached to Deity worship, but because of their attachment to material enjoyment, they cannot be pure Vaiṣṇavas. *Anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyaṁ jñāna-karmādy-anāvṛtam.* The pure Vaiṣṇava has no desire for material enjoyment. That is the basic qualification of a pure Vaiṣṇava. There are men, especially rich men, who regularly worship the Deity, give charity to *brāhmaṇas* and are pious in every respect, but they cannot be pure Vaiṣṇavas. Despite their outward show of Vaiṣṇavism and charity, their inner desire is to enjoy a higher standard of material life. Raghunātha dāsa’s father, Govardhana, and uncle, Hiraṇya dāsa, were both very charitable to *brāhmaṇas.* Indeed, the *brāhmaṇas* from the Gauḍīya district were practically dependent upon them. Thus they were accepted as very pious gentlemen. However, they presented themselves as Vaiṣṇavas to the eyes of people in general, although from a purely spiritual point of view they were ordinary human beings, not pure Vaiṣṇavas. Actual Vaiṣṇavas considered them almost Vaiṣṇavas, not pure Vaiṣṇavas. In other words, they were *kaniṣṭha-adhikārīs,* for they were ignorant of higher Vaiṣṇava regulative principles. Nevertheless, they could not be called *viṣayīs,* or blind materialistic enjoyers.

*tathāpi viṣayera svabhāva — kare mahā-andha  
sei karma karāya, yāte haya bhava-bandha*

### Synonyms

*tathāpi* — still; *viṣayera* *svabhāva* — the potency of material enjoyment; *kare* *mahā*-*andha* — makes one completely blind; *sei* *karma* *karāya* — causes one to act in that way; *yāte* — by which; *haya* — there is; *bhava*-*bandha* — the bondage of birth and death.

### Translation

**“Those who are attached to materialistic life and are blind to spiritual life must act in such a way that they are bound to repeated birth and death by the actions and reactions of their activities.**

### Purport

As clearly stated in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (3.9), *yajñārthāt karmaṇo ’nyatra loko ’yaṁ karma-bandhanaḥ:* if one does not act as a pure devotee, whatever acts he performs will produce reactions of fruitive bondage (*karma-bandhanaḥ*)*.* Similarly, in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (5.5.4) it is said:

*nūnaṁ pramattaḥ kurute vikarma *
 *yad indriya-prītaya āpṛṇoti  
na sādhu manye yata ātmano ’yam *
 *asann api kleśa-da āsa dehaḥ*

“A materialistic person, madly engaged in activities for sense enjoyment, does not know that he is entangling himself in repeated birth and death and that his body, although temporary, is full of miseries.” A *viṣayī,* a person blindly caught in a web of materialistic life, remains in the cycle of birth and death perpetually. Such a person cannot understand how to execute pure devotional service, and therefore he acts as a *karmī, jñānī, yogī* or something else, according to his desire, but he does not know that the activities of *karma*, *jñāna* and *yoga* simply bind one to the cycle of birth and death.

### Translation

**“By His own free will, Lord Kṛṣṇa has delivered you from such a condemned materialistic life. Therefore the glories of Lord Kṛṣṇa’s causeless mercy cannot be expressed.”**

### Purport

In the *Brahma-saṁhitā* (5.54) it is said, *karmāṇi nirdahati kintu ca bhakti-bhājām.* Lord Kṛṣṇa is so merciful that He can stop the reactions of *karma* for His devotee. Everyone — from the small insect called *indra-gopa* up to Indra, the King of heaven — is bound by the reactions of fruitive activities.

*yas tv indra-gopam atha vendram aho sva-karma- *
 *bandhānurūpa-phala-bhājanam ātanoti  
karmāṇi nirdahati kintu ca bhakti-bhājāṁ *
 *govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi*

Everyone, whether an insect or the King of heaven, is entangled and bound by the actions and reactions of his *karma.* However, when one becomes a pure devotee, free from material desires and from bondage to *karma, jñāna* and *yoga,* one is freed from material actions and reactions by the causeless mercy of Kṛṣṇa. One cannot express sufficient gratitude to Kṛṣṇa for being freed from the materialistic way of life.

### Purport

As stated in the *Hari-bhakti-vilāsa* at the end of the twentieth *vilāsa* (366, 379, 382):

*kṛtyāny etāni tu prāyo* *gṛhiṇāṁ dhanināṁ satām  
likhitāni na tu tyakta-* *parigraha-mahātmanām*

*prabhāte cārdha-rātre ca* *madhyāhne divasa-kṣaye  
kīrtayanti hariṁ ye vai* *te taranti bhavārṇavam*

*evam ekāntināṁ prāyaḥ* *kīrtanaṁ smaraṇaṁ prabhoḥ  
kurvatāṁ parama-prītyā* *kṛtyam anyan na rocate*

A well-to-do householder Vaiṣṇava cannot live like a person in the renounced order who completely takes shelter of the holy name. Such a householder should chant the holy name of Kṛṣṇa in the morning, at midday and in the evening. Then he will be able to cross beyond nescience. Pure devotees in the renounced order, however, who fully surrender to the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, should chant the holy name of the Lord with great love and faith, always thinking of Kṛṣṇa’s lotus feet. They should have no occupation other than chanting the holy name of the Lord. In the *Bhakti-sandarbha* (283), Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī says:

*yady api śrī-bhāgavata-mate pañca-rātrādi-vad-arcana-mārgasyāvaśyakatvaṁ nāsti, tad vināpi śaraṇāpatty-ādīnām ekatareṇāpi puruṣārtha-siddher abhihitatvāt.*

“It is *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam’s* opinion that the process of Deity worship is not actually necessary, just as the specific prescriptions of the *Pañcarātra* and other scriptures do not have to be followed. The *Bhāgavatam* enjoins that even without practicing Deity worship one can achieve the complete success of human life by any of the other devotional processes, such as simply offering oneself at the Lord’s feet for His protection.”

### Purport

Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura remarks that people who are under the bodily conception of life are called materialists. If we accept the offerings of such people, place them before the Lord and invite Vaiṣṇavas to partake of the *prasādam,* that attempt will gain us only a material reputation, not the actual benefit of service to a pure Vaiṣṇava. One should therefore try to serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead by fully surrendering at His lotus feet. If one engages for the service of the Lord whatever money one has honestly earned, that is spiritual service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the spiritual master and the Vaiṣṇavas.

### Translation

**“ ‘At my request Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu accepts the invitations because He knows that a foolish person like me would be unhappy if He did not accept them.’**

### Purport

Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura says that people who are advanced in learning but attached to material enjoyment, who are puffed up by material possessions, by birth in an elevated aristocratic family or by education, may offer showbottle devotional service to the Deity and also offer *prasādam* to Vaiṣṇavas. Because of their ignorance, however, they cannot understand that since their minds are materially polluted, neither the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Kṛṣṇa, nor the Vaiṣṇavas accept their offerings. If one accepts money from such materialistic persons to offer food to the Deity and Vaiṣṇavas, a pure Vaiṣṇava does not accept it. This causes unhappiness for the materialists because they are fully absorbed in the bodily conception of life. Therefore they sometimes turn against the Vaiṣṇavas.

### Translation

**“When one eats food offered by a materialistic man, one’s mind becomes contaminated, and when the mind is contaminated, one is unable to think of Kṛṣṇa properly.**

### Purport

Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura suggests that people who are materialistically inclined and *sahajiyās,* or so-called Vaiṣṇavas who take everything very casually, are both *viṣayīs,* or materialists. Eating food offered by them causes contamination, and as a result of such contamination, even a serious devotee becomes like a materialistic man. There are six kinds of association — giving charity, accepting charity, accepting food, offering food, talking confidentially and inquiring confidentially. One should very carefully avoid associating with both the *sahajiyās,* who are sometimes known as Vaiṣṇavas, and the non-Vaiṣṇavas, or *avaiṣṇavas.* Their association changes the transcendental devotional service of Lord Kṛṣṇa into sense gratification, and when sense gratification enters the mind of a devotee, he is contaminated. The materialistic person who aspires after sense gratification cannot properly think of Kṛṣṇa.

### Translation

**“When one accepts an invitation from a person contaminated by the material mode of passion, the person who offers the food and the person who accepts it are both mentally contaminated.**

### Purport

Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura says that there are three varieties of invitations — those in the mode of goodness, those in passion and those in ignorance. An invitation accepted from a pure devotee is in the mode of goodness, an invitation accepted from a person who is pious but materially attached is in the mode of passion, and an invitation accepted from a person who is materially very sinful is in the mode of ignorance.

The person who just passed did not give me anything, but another person will come, and he will give me something.’ Thus a person in the renounced order gives up his neutrality and depends on the charity of this person or that. Thinking in this way, he adopts the occupation of a prostitute.**

**Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu instructed Raghunātha dāsa, “This stone is the transcendental form of Lord Kṛṣṇa. Worship the stone with great eagerness.”**

### Purport

Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura writes in his *Anubhāṣya* that in the opinion of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, the *govardhana-śilā,* the stone from Govardhana Hill, was directly the form of Kṛṣṇa, the son of Mahārāja Nanda. The Lord used the stone for three years, and then in the heart of Raghunātha dāsa the Lord awakened devotional service to the stone. The Lord then gave the stone to Raghunātha dāsa, accepting him as one of His most confidential servants. However, some envious people conclude that because Raghunātha dāsa had not taken birth in the family of a *brāhmaṇa,* Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu did not give him the right to worship the Deity directly but instead gave him a stone from Govardhana. This kind of thought is *nārakī,* or hellish. As stated in the *Padma Purāṇa, arcye viṣṇau śilā-dhīr guruṣu nara-matir vaiṣṇave jāti-buddhiḥ* *.* *.* *.* *yasya vā nārakī saḥ.* If one thinks that the worshipable *śālagrāma-śilā* is a mere stone, that the spiritual master is an ordinary human being or that a pure Vaiṣṇava preaching the *bhakti* cult all over the world is a member of a particular caste or material division of society, he is considered a *nārakī,* a candidate for hellish life. When Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu instructed that the *govardhana-śilā,* the stone taken from Govardhana, is nondifferent from the body of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, He indirectly advised such foolish persons that one should not be envious of a Vaiṣṇava who belongs to a different caste or sect. One should accept a Vaiṣṇava as transcendental. In this way one can be saved; otherwise, one is surely awaiting a hellish life.

All six Gosvāmīs strictly followed the instructions of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. This is the principle for progress in devotional service. After receiving an order from the spiritual master, one must strictly try to execute the order. That is the way of success.

### Purport

This verse (*Bhāg.* 7.15.40) was spoken by Nārada to Yudhiṣṭhira Mahārāja regarding a householder’s liberation from material bondage. On the spiritual platform, one does not unnecessarily care for the body. Śrīla Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura has said, *deha-smṛti nāhi yāra, saṁsāra bandhana kāhāṅ tāra.* One who is spiritually situated does not think that he is the body. Therefore he can transcendentally execute severe penances in the renounced order of life. The best example of such renunciation is Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī.
