The summary of this chapter is given by Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura in his *Amṛta-pravāha-bhāṣya* as follows. In this chapter it is described how Brahmā Haridāsa Ṭhākura gave up his body with the consent of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and how the Lord Himself personally performed the funeral ceremony and carried the body to the sea. He personally entombed the body, covered it with sand and erected a platform on the site. After taking a bath in the sea, He personally begged *prasādam* of Jagannātha from shopkeepers and distributed *prasādam* to the assembled devotees.

### Synonyms

*eta* *bali’* — saying this; *mahā*-*prasāda* — to the *mahā-prasādam*; *karilā* *vandana* — he offered respect; *eka* *rañca* — one fractional part; *lañā* — taking; *tāra* *karilā* *bhakṣaṇa* — ate it.

### Translation

**Saying this, he offered prayers to the mahā-prasādam, took a little portion, and ate it.**

### Purport

*Mahā-prasādam* is nondifferent from Kṛṣṇa. Therefore, instead of eating *mahā-prasādam,* one should honor it. It is said here, *karilā vandana,* “he offered prayers.” When taking *mahā-prasādam,* one should not consider the food ordinary preparations. *Prasāda* means favor. One should consider *mahā-prasādam* a favor of Kṛṣṇa. As stated by Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura, *kṛṣṇa baḍa dayāmaya karibāre jihvā jaya svaprasāda-anna dilā bhāi.* Kṛṣṇa is very kind. In this material world we are all very much attached to tasting various types of food. Therefore, Kṛṣṇa eats many nice varieties of food and offers the food back to the devotees, so that not only are one’s demands for various tastes satisfied, but by eating *prasādam* one makes advancement in spiritual life. Therefore, we should never consider ordinary food on an equal level with *mahā-prasādam.*

### Purport

**Haridāsa Ṭhākura replied, “My disease is that I cannot complete my rounds.”**

If one cannot complete the fixed number of rounds he is assigned, he should be considered to be in a diseased condition of spiritual life. Śrīla Haridāsa Ṭhākura is called *nāmācārya.* Of course, we cannot imitate Haridāsa Ṭhākura, but everyone must chant a prescribed number of rounds. In our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement we have fixed sixteen rounds as the minimum so that the Westerners will not feel burdened. These sixteen rounds must be chanted, and chanted loudly, so that one can hear himself and others.

## Text 24

### Verse text

*prabhu kahe, — “vṛddha ha-ilā ‘saṅkhyā’ alpa kara  
siddha-deha tumi, sādhane āgraha kene kara?*

### Synonyms

*prabhu* *kahe* — Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu said; *vṛddha* *ha*-*ilā* — you have become old; *saṅkhyā* *alpa* *kara* — reduce your number; *siddha*-*deha* *tumi* — you are already liberated; *sādhane* — in the regulative principles; *āgraha* *kene* *kara* — why are you eager.

### Translation

**“Now that you have become old,” the Lord said, “you may reduce the number of rounds you chant daily. You are already liberated, and therefore you need not follow the regulative principles very strictly.**

### Purport

Unless one has come to the platform of spontaneous love of God, he must follow the regulative principles. Ṭhākura Haridāsa was the living example of how to follow the regulative principles. Similarly, Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī was also such a living example. In the *Ṣaḍ-gosvāmy-aṣṭaka* it is stated, *saṅkhyā-pūrvaka-nāma-gāna-natibhiḥ kālāvasānī-kṛtau.* The Gosvāmīs, especially Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī, strictly followed all the regulative principles. The first regulative principle is that one must chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra* loudly enough so that he can hear himself, and one must vow to chant a fixed number of rounds. Not only was Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī chanting a fixed number of rounds, but he had also taken a vow to bow down many times and offer obeisances to the Lord.

### Verse text

*loka nistārite ei tomāra ‘avatāra’  
nāmera mahimā loke karilā pracāra*

### Synonyms

*loka* *nistārite* — to deliver the people in general; *ei* — this; *tomāra* *avatāra* — your incarnation; *nāmera* *mahimā* — the glories of the holy name; *loke* — in this world; *karilā* *pracāra* — you have preached.

### Translation

**“Your role in this incarnation is to deliver the people in general. You have sufficiently preached the glories of the holy name in this world.”**

### Purport

Haridāsa Ṭhākura is known as *nāmācārya* because it is he who preached the glories of chanting *hari-nāma,* the holy name of God. By using the words *tomāra avatāra* (“your incarnation”), Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu confirms that Haridāsa Ṭhākura is the incarnation of Lord Brahmā. Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura says that advanced devotees help the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His mission and that such devotees or personal associates incarnate by the will of the Supreme Lord. The Supreme Lord incarnates by His own will, and, by His will, competent devotees also incarnate to help Him in His mission. Haridāsa Ṭhākura is thus the incarnation of Lord Brahmā, and other devotees are likewise incarnations who help in the prosecution of the Lord’s mission.

### Translation

**The Lord concluded, “Now, therefore, please reduce the fixed number of times you chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra.”**

### Purport

**Haridāsa Ṭhākura replied, “Kindly hear my real plea.**

### Translation

**“My dear Lord, by Your mercy You have made me dance in many ways. For example, I was offered the śrāddha-pātra, which should have been offered to first-class brāhmaṇas. I ate from it even though I was born in a family of meat-eaters.**

### Purport

Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura, in his *Anubhāṣya,* quotes from the *Viṣṇu-smṛti* in reference to the *śrāddha-pātra.*

*brāhmaṇāpasadā hy ete* *kathitāḥ paṅkti-dūṣakāḥ  
etān vivarjayed yatnāt* *śrāddha-karmaṇi paṇḍitaḥ*

According to this verse, if one is born in a *brāhmaṇa* family but does not behave according to brahminical standards, he should not be offered the *śrāddha-pātra,* which is *prasādam* offered to the forefathers. Advaita Ācārya offered the *śrāddha-pātra* to Haridāsa Ṭhākura, not to a *brāhmaṇa* who had been born in a *brāhmaṇa* family. Although Haridāsa Ṭhākura was born in the family of meat-eaters, because he was an advanced devotee he was shown more respect than a first-class *brāhmaṇa.*

### Purport

At Puruṣottama-kṣetra, or Jagannātha Purī, there is a temple of Ṭoṭā-gopīnātha. If one goes from there to the sea, he can discover the tomb of Haridāsa Ṭhākura still existing. Every year on the date of Ananta-caturdaśī there is a festival to commemorate the passing away of Haridāsa Ṭhākura. At the same place, Deities of Nityānanda Prabhu, Kṛṣṇa Caitanya Mahāprabhu and Advaita Prabhu were established about one hundred years ago. A gentleman named Bhramaravara from Kendrāpāḍā, in the province of Orissa, contributed funds to establish these Deities in the temple. The management of the temple was under the Ṭoṭā-gopīnātha *gosvāmīs.*

This temple was later sold to someone else, and this party is now maintaining the *sevā-pūjā* of the temple. Near this temple and the tomb of Haridāsa Ṭhākura, Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura constructed a small house called the Bhakti-kuṭī. In the Bengali year 1329 (A.D. 1922), the Puruṣottama-maṭha, a branch of the Gauḍīya Maṭha, was established there. In the *Bhakti-ratnākara* it is stated:

*śrīnivāsa śīghra samudrera kūle gelā  
haridāsa-ṭhākurera samādhi dekhilā*

*bhūmite paḍiyā kailā praṇati vistara  
bhāgavata-gaṇa śrī-samādhi-sannidhāne  
śrīnivāse sthira kailā sasneha-vacane*

*punaḥ śrīnivāsa śrī-samādhi praṇamiyā  
ye vilāpa kailā, tā śunile drave hiyā*

“Śrīnivāsa Ṭhākura quickly ran to the seashore. When he saw the tomb of Haridāsa Ṭhākura, he immediately fell down offering prayers and almost fainted. The devotees present there pacified him with very sweet and affectionate words, and Śrīnivāsa again offered his obeisances to the tomb. Hearing of the separation that Śrīnivāsa expressed in his lamentation at the tomb of Haridāsa Ṭhākura makes one’s heart melt.”

### Translation

**Haridāsa Ṭhākura was not only the topmost devotee of the Lord but also a great and learned scholar. It was his great fortune that he passed away before Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.**

### Purport

Haridāsa Ṭhākura is mentioned here as the most learned scholar, *parama-vidvān.* Actually, the most important science to know is the science of getting out of the clutches of material existence. Anyone who knows this science must be considered the greatest learned person. Anyone who knows the temporary situation of this material world and is expert in achieving a permanent situation in the spiritual world, who knows that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is beyond the jurisdiction of our experimental knowledge, is understood to be the most learned scholar. Haridāsa Ṭhākura knew this science perfectly. Therefore, he is described in this connection as *parama-vidvān.* He personally preached the importance of chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra,* which is approved by the revealed scriptures. As stated in the *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (7.5.24):

*iti puṁsārpitā viṣṇau* *bhaktiś cen nava-lakṣaṇā  
kriyeta bhagavaty addhā* *tan manye ’dhītam uttamam*

There are nine different processes of devotional service to Kṛṣṇa, the most important being *śravaṇaṁ kīrtanam* — hearing and chanting. Haridāsa Ṭhākura knew this science very well, and he can therefore be called, technically, *sarva-śāstrādhītī.* Anyone who has learned the essence of all the Vedic scriptures is to be known as a first-class educated person, with full knowledge of all *śāstra.*
