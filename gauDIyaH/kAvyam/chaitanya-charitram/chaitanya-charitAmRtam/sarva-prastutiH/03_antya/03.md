CHAPTER THREE

A summary of the third chapter is given by Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura as follows. A beautiful young *brāhmaṇa* girl in Jagannātha Purī had a very handsome son who was coming every day to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. This was not very much to the liking of Dāmodara Paṇḍita, however, who therefore told Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, “If You display so much love for this boy, people will doubt Your character.” Hearing these words from Dāmodara Paṇḍita, the Lord sent him to Navadvīpa to supervise the affairs of His mother, Śacīdevī. He also especially requested Dāmodara Paṇḍita to remind His mother that He was sometimes going to her home to accept the food she offered. Thus, following the order of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Dāmodara Paṇḍita went to Navadvīpa, taking with him all kinds of *prasādam* from Lord Jagannātha.

On another occasion, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu once inquired from Haridāsa Ṭhākura, who was known as Brahma Haridāsa, how the *yavanas,* or persons bereft of Vedic culture, would be delivered in Kali-yuga*.* Haridāsa Ṭhākura replied that their deliverance would be possible if they very loudly chanted the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra,* for hearing the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra* chanted loudly, even with but little realization, would help them.

After describing this incident, the author of the *Caitanya-caritāmṛta* also describes how Haridāsa Ṭhākura was tested at Benāpola, a village near Śāntipura. A person named Rāmacandra Khān, who was envious of Haridāsa Ṭhākura, sent a professional prostitute to attempt to defame him, but by the mercy of Haridāsa Ṭhākura, even the prostitute was delivered. Because of offending a pure Vaiṣṇava, Rāmacandra Khān was later cursed by Nityānanda Prabhu and ruined.

From Benāpola, Haridāsa Ṭhākura went to the village known as Cāndapura, where he lived at the house of Balarāma Ācārya. Thereafter, Haridāsa Ṭhākura was received by two brothers known as Hiraṇya and Govardhana Majumadāra, but in the course of a discussion he was offended by a caste *brāhmaṇa* known as Gopāla Cakravartī. Because of this offense, Gopāla Cakravartī was punished by being afflicted with leprosy.

Haridāsa Ṭhākura later left Cāndapura and went to the house of Advaita Ācārya, where he was tested by Māyādevī, the personification of the external energy. She also received his favor by being blessed with the chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra.*

### Purport

Dāmodara Paṇḍita was a great devotee of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Sometimes, however, a person in such a position becomes impudent, being influenced by the external energy and material considerations. Thus a devotee mistakenly dares to criticize the activities of the spiritual master or the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Despite the logic that “Caesar’s wife must be above suspicion,” a devotee should not be disturbed by the activities of his spiritual master and should not try to criticize him. A devotee should be fixed in the conclusion that the spiritual master cannot be subject to criticism and should never be considered equal to a common man. Even if there appears to be some discrepancy according to an imperfect devotee’s estimation, the devotee should be fixed in the conviction that even if his spiritual master goes to a liquor shop, he is not a drunkard; rather, he must have some purpose in going there. It is said in a Bengali poem:

*yadyapi nityānanda surā-bāḍi yāya  
tathāpio haya nityānanda-rāya*

“Even if I see that Lord Nityānanda has entered a liquor shop, I shall not be diverted from my conclusion that Nityānanda Rāya is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.”

### Purport

As a simple and staunch devotee of Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Dāmodara Paṇḍita could not tolerate criticism of the Lord, but unfortunately he himself was criticizing Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu in his own way. The Lord could understand that it was because of Dāmodara Paṇḍita’s simplicity that he impudently dared criticize Him. Nevertheless, such behavior by a devotee is not very good.

Because mother Śacī was feeling separation from Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, she thought she was dreaming that her son had come to her. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, however, wanted to inform her that actually it was not a dream. He actually came there and ate whatever His mother offered Him. Such are the dealings of advanced devotees with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As stated in the *Brahma-saṁhitā* (5.38):

*premāñjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena *
 *santaḥ sadaiva hṛdayeṣu vilokayanti  
yaṁ śyāmasundaram acintya-guṇa-svarūpaṁ *
 *govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi*

“I worship the primeval Lord, Govinda, who is always seen by the devotee whose eyes are anointed with the pulp of love. He is seen in His eternal form of Śyāmasundara, situated within the heart of the devotee.” Pure devotees realize dealings with the Lord on the transcendental plane, but because the devotees are still in the material world, they think that these are dreams. The Lord, however, talks with the advanced devotee, and the advanced devotee also sees Him. It is all factual; it is not a dream.

### Translation

**“My dear Ṭhākura Haridāsa, in this Age of Kali most people are bereft of Vedic culture, and therefore they are called yavanas. They are concerned only with killing cows and brahminical culture. In this way they all engage in sinful acts.**

### Purport

From this statement by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu we can clearly understand that the word *yavana* does not refer only to a particular class of men. Anyone who is against the behavior of the Vedic principles is called a *yavana.* Such a *yavana* may be in India or outside of India. As described here, the symptom of *yavanas* is that they are violent killers of cows and brahminical culture. We offer our prayers to the Lord by saying, *namo brahmaṇya-devāya* *go-brāhmaṇa-hitāya ca.* The Lord is the maintainer of brahminical culture. His first concern is to see to the benefit of cows and *brāhmaṇas.* As soon as human civilization turns against brahminical culture and allows unrestricted killing of cows, we should understand that men are no longer under the control of the Vedic culture but are all *yavanas* and *mlecchas.* It is said that the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement will be prominent within the next ten thousand years, but after that people will all become *mlecchas* and *yavanas.* Thus at the end of the *yuga,* Kṛṣṇa will appear as the Kalki *avatāra* and kill them without consideration.

### Translation

**“How will these yavanas be delivered? To My great unhappiness, I do not see any way.”**

### Purport

This verse reveals the significance of Lord Śrī Caitanya’s appearance as *patita-pāvana,* the deliverer of all the fallen souls. Śrīla Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura sings, *patita-pāvana-hetu tava avatāra:* “O my Lord, You have appeared just to deliver all the fallen souls.” *Mo-sama patita prabhu nā pāibe āra:* “And among all the fallen souls, I am the lowest.” How Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya Mahāprabhu was always thinking about the deliverance of the fallen souls is shown by the statement *e duḥkha apāra* (“It is My great unhappiness”). This statement indicates that Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, who is the Supreme Personality of Godhead Kṛṣṇa Himself, is always very unhappy to see the fallen souls in the material world. Therefore He Himself comes as He is, or He comes as a devotee in the form of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, to deliver love of Kṛṣṇa directly to the fallen souls. *Namo mahā-vadānyāya kṛṣṇa-prema-pradāya te.* Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is so merciful that He not only gives knowledge of Kṛṣṇa but by His practical activities teaches everyone how to love Kṛṣṇa (*kṛṣṇa-prema-pradāya te*).

Those who are following in the footsteps of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu should take the Lord’s mission most seriously. In this Age of Kali, people are gradually becoming less than animals. Nevertheless, although they are eating the flesh of cows and are envious of brahminical culture, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is considering how to deliver them from this horrible condition of life. Thus He asks all Indians to take up His mission:

*bhārata-bhūmite haila manuṣya-janma yāra  
janma sārthaka kari’ kara para-upakāra*

“One who has taken his birth as a human being in the land of India \[Bhārata-varṣa\] should make his life successful and work for the benefit of all other people.” (Cc. *Ādi-līlā* 9.41) it is therefore the duty of every advanced and cultured Indian to take this cause very seriously. All Indians should help the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement in its progress, to the best of their ability. Then they will be considered real followers of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Unfortunately, even some so-called Vaiṣṇavas enviously refuse to cooperate with this movement but instead condemn it in so many ways. We are very sorry to say that these people try to find fault with us, being unnecessarily envious of our activities, although we are trying to the best of our ability to introduce the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement directly into the countries of the *yavanas* and *mlecchas.* Such *yavanas* and *mlecchas* are coming to us and becoming purified Vaiṣṇavas who follow in the footsteps of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. One who identifies himself as a follower of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu should feel like Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, who said, *ihā-sabāra kon mate ha-ibe nistāra:* “How will all these *yavanas* be delivered?” Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was always anxious to deliver the fallen souls because their fallen condition gave Him great unhappiness. That is the platform on which one can propagate the mission of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

### Translation

**Haridāsa Ṭhākura replied, “My dear Lord, do not be in anxiety. Do not be unhappy to see the condition of the yavanas in material existence.**

### Purport

These words of Haridāsa Ṭhākura are just befitting a devotee who has dedicated his life and soul to the service of the Lord. When the Lord is unhappy because of the condition of the fallen souls, the devotee consoles Him, saying, “My dear Lord, do not be in anxiety.” This is service. Everyone should adopt the cause of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu to try to relieve Him from the anxiety He feels. This is actually service to the Lord. One who tries to relieve Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s anxiety for the fallen souls is certainly a most dear and confidential devotee of the Lord. To blaspheme such a devotee who is trying his best to spread the cult of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is the greatest offense. One who does so is simply awaiting punishment for his envy.

**“A devotee in advanced ecstatic love exclaims, ‘O my Lord Rāmacandra! O my Lord Rāmacandra!’ But the yavanas also chant, ‘hā rāma, hā rāma!’ Just see their good fortune!”**

### Purport

If a child touches fire, the fire will burn him, and if an elderly man touches fire, it will burn him also. Haridāsa Ṭhākura says that a great devotee of the Lord exclaims *hā rāma, hā rāma,* but although *yavanas* do not know the transcendental meaning of *hā rāma, hā rāma,* they say those words in the course of their ordinary life. For the *yavanas* the words *hā rāma* mean “abominable,” whereas the devotee exclaims the words *hā rāma* in ecstatic love. Nevertheless, because the words *hā rāma* are the spiritual *summum bonum,* the fact is the same, whether they are uttered by *yavanas* or by great devotees, just as fire is the same both for a child and for an elderly man. In other words, the holy name of the Lord, *hā rāma,* always acts, even when the holy name is chanted without reference to the Supreme Lord. *Yavanas* utter the holy name in a different attitude than devotees, but the holy name *hā rāma* is so powerful spiritually that it acts anywhere, whether one knows it or not. This is explained as follows.

### Translation

**Nāmācārya Haridāsa Ṭhākura, the authority on the chanting of the holy name, said, “The chanting of the Lord’s holy name to indicate something other than the Lord is an instance of nāmābhāsa. Even when the holy name is chanted in this way, its transcendental power is not destroyed.**

### Translation

**“ ‘Even a mleccha who is being killed by the tusk of a boar and who cries in distress again and again, “hā rāma, hā rāma” attains liberation. What then to speak of those who chant the holy name with veneration and faith?’**

### Purport

This refers to an instance in which a meat-eater being killed by a boar uttered the words *hā rāma, hā rāma* again and again at the time of his death. Since this is a quotation from the *Nṛsiṁha Purāṇa,* this indicates that in the purāṇic age there must also have been *mlecchas* and *yavanas* (meat-eaters), and the words *hā rāma,* meaning “condemned,” were also uttered in those days. Thus Haridāsa Ṭhākura gives evidence that even a meat-eater who condemns something by uttering the words *hā rāma* gets the benefit of chanting the holy name that the devotee chants to mean “O my Lord Rāma!”

### Translation

**“The letters of the holy name have so much spiritual potency that they act even when uttered improperly.**

### Purport

Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura states that the word *vyavahita* (“improperly uttered”) is not used here to refer to the mundane vibration of the letters of the alphabet. Such negligent utterance for the sense gratification of materialistic persons is not a vibration of transcendental sound. Utterance of the holy name while one engages in sense gratification is an impediment on the path toward achieving ecstatic love for Kṛṣṇa. On the other hand, if one who is eager for devotional service utters the holy name even partially or improperly, the holy name, which is identical with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, exhibits its spiritual potency because of that person’s offenseless utterance. Thus one is relieved from all unwanted practices, and one gradually awakens his dormant love for Kṛṣṇa.

### Translation

**“ ‘If a devotee once utters the holy name of the Lord, or if it penetrates his mind or enters his ear, which is the channel of aural reception, that holy name will certainly deliver him from material bondage, whether vibrated properly or improperly, with correct or incorrect grammar, or properly joined or vibrated in separate parts. O brāhmaṇa, the potency of the holy name is therefore certainly great. However, if one uses the vibration of the holy name for the benefit of the material body, for material wealth and followers, or under the influence of greed or atheism — in other words, if one utters the name with offenses — such chanting will not produce the desired result very soon. Therefore one should diligently avoid offenses in chanting the holy name of the Lord.’ ”**

### Purport

This verse from the *Padma Purāṇa* is included in the *Hari-bhakti-vilāsa* (11.289) by Sanātana Gosvāmī. Therein Śrīla Sanātana Gosvāmī gives the following explanation:

*vāci gataṁ prasaṅgād vāṅ-madhye pravṛttam api, smaraṇa-patha-gataṁ kathañcin manaḥ-spṛṣṭam api, śrotra-mūlaṁ gataṁ kiñcit śrutam api, śuddha-varṇaṁ vā aśuddha-varṇam api vā, vyavahitaṁ śabdāntareṇa yad-vyavadhānaṁ vakṣyamāna-nārāyaṇa-śabdasya kiñcid uccāraṇānantaraṁ prasaṅgād āpatitaṁ śabdāntaraṁ tena rahitaṁ sat.*

This means that if one somehow or other hears, utters or remembers the holy name, or if it catches his mind while coming near his ears, that holy name, even if vibrated in separate words, will act. An example of such separation is given as follows:

*yadvā, yadyapi ‘halaṁ riktam’ ity ādy-uktau hakāra-rikārayor vṛttyā harīti-nāmāsty eva, tathā ‘rāja-mahiṣī’ ity atra rāma-nāmāpi, evam anyad apy ūhyam, tathāpi tat-tan-nāma-madhye vyavadhāyakam akṣarāntaram astīty etādṛśa-vyavadhāna-rahitam ity arthaḥ, yadvā, vyavahitaṁ ca tad-rahitaṁ cāpi vā, tatra vyavahitaṁ nāmnaḥ kiñcid uccāraṇānantaraṁ kathañcid āpatitaṁ śabdāntaraṁ samādhāya paścān nāmāvaśiṣṭākṣara-grahaṇam ity evaṁ rūpaṁ, madhye śabdāntareṇāntaritam ity arthaḥ, rahitaṁ paścād avaśiṣṭākṣara-grahaṇa-varjitaṁ, kenacid aṁśena hīnam ity arthaḥ, tathāpi tārayaty eva.*

Suppose one is using the two words *halaṁ riktam.* Now the syllable *ha* in the word *halam* and the syllable *ri* in *riktam* are separately pronounced, but nevertheless the holy name will act because one somehow or other utters the word *hari.* Similarly, in the word *rāja-mahiṣī,* the syllables *rā* and *ma* appear in two separate words, but because they somehow or other appear together, the holy name *rāma* will act, provided there are no offenses.

*sarvebhyaḥ pāpebhyo ’parādhebhyaś ca saṁsārād apy uddhārayaty eveti satyam eva, kintu nāma-sevanasya mukhyaṁ yat phalaṁ tan na sadyaḥ sampadyate. tathā deha-bharaṇādy-artham api nāma-sevanena mukhyaṁ phalam āśu na sidhyatīty āha, tac ced iti.*

The holy name has so much spiritual potency that it can deliver one from all sinful reactions and material entanglements, but utterance of the holy name will not be very soon fruitful if done to facilitate sinning.

*tan nāma ced yadi dehādi-madhye nikṣiptaṁ, deha-bharaṇādy-artham eva vinyastam, tadāpi phala-janakaṁ na bhavati kim? api tu bhavaty eva, kintu atra iha loke śīghraṁ na bhavati, kintu vilambenaiva bhavatīty arthaḥ.*

The holy name is so powerful that it must act, but when one utters the holy name with offenses, its action will be delayed, not immediate, although in favorable circumstances the holy names of the Lord act very quickly.

Worship Him with a faithful, unflinching mind, without duplicity and in a highly elevated manner. Thus worship the Lord, whose name is like the sun, for just as a slight appearance of the sun dissipates the darkness of night, so a slight appearance of the holy name of Kṛṣṇa can drive away all the darkness of ignorance that arises in the heart due to greatly sinful activities performed in previous lives.’**

### Purport

While we are preaching, opposing elements sometimes argue, “If all living entities were delivered by the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, what would happen then? The universe would be devoid of living entities.” In answer to this, we may say that in a prison there are many prisoners, but if one thinks that the prison would be empty if all the prisoners adopted good behavior, he is incorrect. Even if all the prisoners within a jail are freed, other criminals will fill it again. A prison will never be vacant, for there are many prospective criminals who will fill the prison cells, even if the present criminals are freed by the government. As confirmed in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (13.22), *kāraṇaṁ guṇa-saṅgo ’sya sad-asad-yoni-janmasu:* “Because of the living entity’s association with material nature, he meets with good and evil among various species.” There are many unmanifested living entities covered by the mode of ignorance who will gradually come to the mode of passion. Most of them will become criminals because of their fruitive activities and again fill the prisons.

### Translation

**Haridāsa Ṭhākura constructed a cottage in a solitary forest. There he planted a tulasī plant, and in front of the tulasī he would chant the holy name of the Lord 300,000 times daily. He chanted throughout the entire day and night.**

### Purport

The village of Benāpola is situated in the district of Yaśohara (Jessore), which is now in Bangladesh. Benāpola is near the Bangaon station, which is at the border of Bangladesh and may be reached by the Eastern Railway from Sealdah Station in Calcutta. Haridāsa Ṭhākura, being the *ācārya* of chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra,* is called Nāmācārya Haridāsa Ṭhākura. From his personal example we can understand that chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra* and becoming highly elevated in Kṛṣṇa consciousness is very simple. Without difficulty one can sit down anywhere, especially on the bank of the Ganges, Yamunā or any other sacred river, devise a sitting place or cottage, plant a *tulasī* tree, and before the *tulasī* chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra* undisturbed.

Haridāsa Ṭhākura used to chant the holy name on his beads 300,000 times daily. Throughout the entire day and night, he would chant the sixteen names of the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra.* One should not, however, imitate Haridāsa Ṭhākura, for no one else can chant the holy name 300,000 times a day. Such chanting is for the *mukta-puruṣa,* or liberated soul. We can follow his example, however, by chanting sixteen rounds of the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra* on beads every day and offering respect to the *tulasī* plant. This is not at all difficult for anyone, and the process of chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra* with a vow before the *tulasī* plant has such great spiritual potency that simply by doing this one can become spiritually strong. Therefore we request the members of the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement to follow Haridāsa Ṭhākura’s example rigidly. Chanting sixteen rounds does not take much time, nor is offering respects to the *tulasī* plant difficult. The process has immense spiritual potency. One should not miss this opportunity.

*brāhmaṇera ghare kare bhikṣā nirvāhaṇa  
prabhāve sakala loka karaye pūjana*

### Synonyms

*brāhmaṇera* *ghare* — in the house of a *brāhmaṇa*; *kare* — does; *bhikṣā* *nirvāhaṇa* — asking alms of food; *prabhāve* — by spiritual potency; *sakala* *loka* — all people; *karaye* *pūjana* — worship.

### Translation

**For his bodily maintenance he would go to a brāhmaṇa’s house and beg some food. He was spiritually so influential that all the neighboring people worshiped him.**

### Purport

In the days of Haridāsa Ṭhākura, all the *brāhmaṇas* worshiped Nārāyaṇa in the form of the *śālagrāma-śilā.* Therefore begging from a *brāhmaṇa’s* house meant taking *kṛṣṇa-prasādam,* which is transcendental (*nirguṇa*)*.* If we take food from the houses of others, such as *karmīs,* we shall have to share the qualities of those from whom we take alms. Therefore Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu took *prasādam* in the houses of Vaiṣṇavas. This is the general process. The members of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement are advised not to take food from anywhere but a Vaiṣṇava’s or *brāhmaṇa’s* house where Deity worship is performed. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu has said, *viṣayīra anna khāile duṣṭa haya mana:* if a devotee takes alms or food from the house of a *karmī* who is simply interested in money, his mind will become unclean. We must always remember that a devotee’s life is one of *vairāgya-vidyā,* or renunciation and knowledge. Therefore all devotees are warned not to live unnecessarily luxurious lives at the cost of others. *Gṛhasthas* living within the jurisdiction of the temple must be especially careful not to imitate *karmīs* by acquiring opulent clothing, food and conveyances. As far as possible, these should be avoided. A member of the temple, whether *gṛhastha, brahmacārī* or *sannyāsī,* must practice a life of renunciation, following in the footsteps of Haridāsa Ṭhākura and the six Gosvāmīs. Otherwise, because *māyā* is very strong, at any time one may become a victim of *māyā* and fall down from spiritual life.

### Translation

**By no means could he find any fault in the character of Haridāsa Ṭhākura. Therefore he called for local prostitutes and began a plan to discredit His Holiness.**

### Purport

This is typical of atheistic men, but even among so-called religionists, *sādhus,* mendicants, *sannyāsīs* and *brahmacārīs,* there are many enemies of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement who always try to find faults in it, not considering that the movement is spreading automatically by the grace of Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, who wanted it spread all over the world, in every town and village. We are trying to fulfill the Lord’s desire, and our attempt has become fairly successful, but the enemies of this movement unnecessarily try to find faults in it, exactly like the old rascal Rāmacandra Khān, who opposed Haridāsa Ṭhākura.

### Translation

**Rāmacandra Khān said to the prostitutes, “There is a mendicant named Haridāsa Ṭhākura. All of you devise a way to deviate him from his vows of austerity.”**

### Purport

Devotional service is the path of *vairāgya-vidyā* (renunciation and knowledge). Haridāsa Ṭhākura was following this path, but Rāmacandra Khān planned to induce him to break his vows. Renunciation means renunciation of sensual pleasure, especially the pleasure of sex. Therefore a *brahmacārī,* *sannyāsī* or *vānaprastha* is strictly prohibited from having relationships with women. Haridāsa Ṭhākura was strictly renounced, and thus Rāmacandra Khān called for prostitutes because prostitutes know how to break a man’s vow of celibacy by their feminine influence and thus pollute a mendicant or a person engaged in devotional life. It was impossible for Rāmacandra Khān to induce any other women to break Haridāsa Ṭhākura’s vow, and therefore he called for prostitutes. Free mingling with women has never been possible in India, but for one who wanted to associate with society girls, they were available in a district of prostitutes. There were prostitutes in human society even in Lord Kṛṣṇa’s time, for it is said that the prostitutes of Dvārakā City came forth to receive the Lord. Although they were prostitutes, they were also devotees of Kṛṣṇa.

*tulasīre* — unto the *tulasī* plant; *tāṅke* — unto Haridāsa Ṭhākura; *veśyā* — the prostitute; *namaskāra* *kari’* — offering obeisances; *dvāre* *vasi’* — sitting at the door; *nāma* — the holy name; *śune* — hears; *bale* — says; *hari* *hari* — “O my Lord Hari, O my Lord Hari.”.

### Translation

**After offering her obeisances to the tulasī plant and Haridāsa Ṭhākura, she sat down at the door. Hearing Haridāsa Ṭhākura chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra, she also chanted, “O my Lord Hari, O my Lord Hari.”**

### Purport

Herein one can clearly see how a Vaiṣṇava delivers a fallen soul by a transcendental trick. The prostitute came to pollute Haridāsa Ṭhākura, but he took it as his duty to deliver the prostitute. As clearly demonstrated here, the process of deliverance is very simple. With faith and reverence the prostitute associated with Haridāsa Ṭhākura, who personally treated her material disease by chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra.* Although the prostitute had an ulterior motive, somehow or other she got the association of a Vaiṣṇava and satisfied him by occasionally chanting in imitation, “O my Lord Hari, O my Lord Hari.” The conclusion is that associating with a Vaiṣṇava, chanting the holy name of the Lord and offering obeisances to the *tulasī* plant or a Vaiṣṇava all lead one to become a transcendental devotee who is completely cleansed of all material contamination.

### Translation

**“I have vowed to chant ten million names in a month. I have taken this vow, but now it is nearing its end.**

### Purport

If one regularly chants 333,333 names daily for a month (30 days) and then chants ten more names, he will thus chant ten million names. In this way a devotee worships the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Such worship is called *yajña.* *Yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana-prāyair yajanti hi su-medhasaḥ:* those whose intelligence is brilliant accept this *hari-nāma-yajña,* the *yajña* of chanting the holy name of the Lord. By performing this *yajña,* one satisfies the Supreme Personality of Godhead and thus attains perfection in spiritual life. According to external vision, Haridāsa Ṭhākura belonged to a Muslim family. Nevertheless, because he engaged himself in performing the *yajña* of chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra,* he became a regularly initiated *brāhmaṇa.* As stated in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (3.33.6):

*yan-nāmadheya-śravaṇānukīrtanād *
 *yat-prahvaṇād yat-smaraṇād api kvacit  
śvādo ’pi sadyaḥ savanāya kalpate *
 *kutaḥ punas te bhagavan nu darśanāt*

Even if a devotee comes from a family of dog-eaters, if he surrenders to the Personality of Godhead he immediately becomes a qualified *brāhmaṇa* and is immediately fit to perform *yajña,* whereas a person born in a family of *brāhmaṇas* has to wait until completing the reformatory processes before he may be called *saṁskṛta,* purified. It is further said in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (12.1.40):

*asaṁskṛtāḥ kriyā-hīnā* *rajasā tamasāvṛtāḥ  
prajās te bhakṣayiṣyanti* *mlecchā rājanya-rūpiṇaḥ*

“In the Age of Kali, *mlecchas,* or lowborn people who have not undergone the purifying process of *saṁskāra,* who do not know how to apply that process in actual life, and who are covered by the modes of passion and ignorance will take the posts of administrators. They will devour the citizens with their atheistic activities.” A person who is not purified by the prescribed process of *saṁskāra* is called *asaṁskṛta,* but if one remains *kriyā-hīna* even after being purified by initiation — in other words, if one fails to actually apply the principles of purity in his life — he remains an unpurified *mleccha* or *yavana.* On the other hand, we find that Haridāsa Ṭhākura, although born in a *mleccha* or *yavana* family, became Nāmācārya Haridāsa Ṭhākura because he performed the *nāma-yajña* a minimum of 300,000 times every day.

Herein we find that Haridāsa Ṭhākura strictly followed his regulative principle of chanting 300,000 names. Thus when the prostitute became restless, he informed her that first he had to finish his chanting and then he would be able to satisfy her. Actually Haridāsa Ṭhākura chanted the holy name of the Lord for three nights continuously and gave the prostitute a chance to hear him. Thus she became purified, as will be seen in the following verses.

### Translation

**“Tomorrow I will surely finish, and my vow will be fulfilled. Then it will be possible for me to enjoy with you in full freedom.”**

### Purport

Haridāsa Ṭhākura never wanted to enjoy the prostitute, but he tricked her to deliver her by giving her a chance to hear the holy name of the Lord while he chanted. Pure devotees chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra,* and simply by hearing this chanting from a purified transcendental person, one is purified of all sinful activities, no matter how lowborn or fallen one may be. As soon as one is thus completely free from the reactions of sinful activities, he is eligible to render devotional service to the Lord. This is the process for engaging the fallen souls in devotional service. As Lord Kṛṣṇa says in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (7.28):

*yeṣāṁ tv anta-gataṁ pāpaṁ* *janānāṁ puṇya-karmaṇām  
te dvandva-moha-nirmuktā* *bhajante māṁ dṛḍha-vratāḥ*

“Persons who have acted piously in previous lives and in this life and whose sinful actions are completely eradicated are freed from the duality of delusion, and they engage themselves in My service with determination.”

### Purport

Haridāsa Ṭhākura’s instruction that the prostitute should distribute to the *brāhmaṇas* all the property she had at home is very significant. Haridāsa Ṭhākura never advised the prostitute to give charity to the so-called *daridra-nārāyaṇas* (“poor Nārāyaṇas”) or any other such persons. According to Vedic civilization, charity should be given only to the qualified *brāhmaṇas*. As stated in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (18.42):

*śamo damas tapaḥ śaucaṁ* *kṣāntir ārjavam eva ca  
jñānaṁ vijñānam āstikyaṁ* *brahma-karma svabhāva-jam*

The brahminical qualifications are truthfulness, control of the senses and mind, tolerance, simplicity, knowledge, practical application of transcendental knowledge in one’s life, and full faith in the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Persons engaged in pursuing spiritual understanding have no time to earn their livelihood. They depend completely on the mercy of the Lord, who says in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (9.22) that He personally carries to them all their necessities (*yoga-kṣemaṁ vahāmy aham*)*.*

The Vedic civilization recommends that one give charity to *brāhmaṇas* and *sannyāsīs,* not to the so-called *daridra-nārāyaṇas.* Nārāyaṇa cannot be *daridra,* nor can *daridra* be Nārāyaṇa, for these are contradictory terms. Atheistic men invent such concoctions and preach them to fools, but charity should actually be given to *brāhmaṇas* and *sannyāsīs* because whatever money they get they spend for Kṛṣṇa. Whatever charity one gives to a *brāhmaṇa* goes to Kṛṣṇa, who says in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (9.27):

*yat karoṣi yad aśnāsi* *yaj juhoṣi dadāsi yat  
yat tapasyasi kaunteya* *tat kuruṣva mad-arpaṇam*

“Whatever you do, whatever you eat, whatever you offer or give away, and whatever austerities you perform — do that, O son of Kuntī, as an offering to Me.” Everything actually belongs to Kṛṣṇa, but so-called civilized men unfortunately think that everything belongs to them. This is the mistake of materialistic civilization. The prostitute (*veśyā*) had earned money by questionable means, and therefore Haridāsa Ṭhākura advised her to distribute to the *brāhmaṇas* whatever she possessed. When Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī retired from family life, he distributed fifty percent of his income to the *brāhmaṇas* and Vaiṣṇavas. A *brāhmaṇa* knows what the Absolute Truth is, and a Vaiṣṇava, knowing the Absolute Truth, acts on behalf of the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Generally one earns money by many questionable means. Therefore at some time one should retire and distribute whatever one has to the *brāhmaṇas* and Vaiṣṇavas who engage in devotional service by preaching the glories of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

### Translation

**“Chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra continuously and render service to the tulasī plant by watering her and offering prayers to her. In this way you will very soon get the opportunity to be sheltered at the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa.”**

### Purport

At least five thousand years ago, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa expressed His desire that everyone surrender to Him (*sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja*)*.* Why is it that people cannot do this? Kṛṣṇa assures, *ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi mā śucaḥ:* “I shall deliver you from all sinful reactions. Do not fear.” Everyone is suffering from the results of sinful activities, but Kṛṣṇa says that if one surrenders unto Him, He will protect one from sinful reactions. Modern civilization, however, is interested neither in Kṛṣṇa nor in getting relief from sinful acts. Therefore men are suffering. Surrender is the ultimate instruction of the *Bhagavad-gītā,* but for one who cannot surrender to the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, it is better to chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra* constantly, under the instruction of Haridāsa Ṭhākura.

In our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement we are teaching our followers to chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra* continuously on beads. Even those who are not accustomed to this practice are advised to chant at least sixteen rounds on their beads so that they may be trained. Otherwise, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu recommended:

*tṛṇād api su-nīcena* *taror iva sahiṣṇunā  
amāninā māna-dena* *kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ*

“One should chant the holy name of the Lord in a humble state of mind, thinking oneself lower than the straw in the street. One should be more tolerant than a tree, devoid of all sense of false prestige, and ready to offer all respect to others. In such a state of mind one can chant the holy name of the Lord constantly.” *Sadā* means “always.” Haridāsa Ṭhākura says, *nirantara nāma lao:* “Chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra* without stopping.”

Although Kṛṣṇa wants everyone to surrender to His lotus feet, because of people’s sinful activities they cannot do this. *Na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ prapadyante narādhamāḥ:* rascals and fools, the lowest of men, who engage in sinful activities, cannot suddenly surrender to the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa. Nevertheless, if they begin chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra* and rendering service unto the *tulasī* plant, they will very soon be able to surrender. One’s real duty is to surrender to the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, but if one is unable to do so, he should adopt this process, as introduced by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and His most confidential servant, Nāmācārya Śrīla Haridāsa Ṭhākura. This is the way to achieve success in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

### Translation

**Thereafter, the prostitute distributed to the brāhmaṇas whatever household possessions she had, following the order of her spiritual master.**

### Purport

Sometimes the word *gṛha-vṛtti* is substituted for the word *gṛha-vitta*. *Vṛtti* means “profession.” The *gṛha-vṛtti* of the prostitute was to enchant foolish people and induce them to indulge in sex. Here, however, *gṛha-vṛtti* is not a suitable word. The proper word is *gṛha-vitta,* which means “all the possessions she had in her home.” All the girl’s possessions had been earned by professional prostitution and were therefore products of her sinful life. When such possessions are given to *brāhmaṇas* and Vaiṣṇavas who can engage them in the service of the Lord because of their advancement in spiritual life, this indirectly helps the person who gives the charity, for he is thus relieved of sinful reactions. As Kṛṣṇa promises, *ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi:* “I shall save you from all sinful reactions.” When our Kṛṣṇa conscious devotees go out to beg charity or collect contributions in the form of membership fees, the money thus coming to the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is strictly employed to advance Kṛṣṇa consciousness all over the world. The Kṛṣṇa conscious devotees collect the money of others for the service of Kṛṣṇa, and they are satisfied with Kṛṣṇa’s *prasādam* and whatever He gives them for their maintenance. They do not desire material comforts. However, they go to great pains to engage the possessions of prostitutes, or persons who are more or less like prostitutes, in the service of the Lord and thus free them from sinful reactions. A Vaiṣṇava *guru* accepts money or other contributions, but he does not employ such contributions for sense gratification. A pure Vaiṣṇava thinks himself unfit to help free even one person from the reactions of sinful life, but he engages one’s hard-earned money in the service of the Lord and thus frees one from sinful reactions. A Vaiṣṇava *guru* is never dependent on the contributions of his disciples. Following the instructions of Haridāsa Ṭhākura, a pure Vaiṣṇava does not personally take even a single paisa from anyone, but he induces his followers to spend for the service of the Lord whatever possessions they have.

Stalwart, highly advanced Vaiṣṇava devotees are not interested in seeing prostitutes, but when a prostitute or any other fallen soul becomes a Vaiṣṇava, stalwart Vaiṣṇavas are interested in seeing them. Anyone can be turned into a Vaiṣṇava if he or she follows the Vaiṣṇava principles. A devotee who follows these principles is no longer on the material platform. Therefore, it is one’s strict adherence to the principles that should be considered, not the country of one’s birth. Many devotees join our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement from Europe and America, but one should not therefore consider them European Vaiṣṇavas or American Vaiṣṇavas. A Vaiṣṇava is a Vaiṣṇava and should therefore be given all the respect due a Vaiṣṇava.

It is said, *phalena paricīyate:* one is recognized by the result of his actions. In Vaiṣṇava society there are many types of Vaiṣṇavas. Some of them are called *gosvāmīs,* some are called *svāmīs,* some are *prabhus,* and some are *prabhupāda.* One is not recognized, however, simply by such a name. A spiritual master is recognized as an actual *guru* when it is seen that he has changed the character of his disciples. Haridāsa Ṭhākura actually changed the character of the professional prostitute. People greatly appreciated this, and therefore they all offered obeisances to Haridāsa Ṭhākura and glorified him.

*paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ* *vināśāya ca duṣkṛtām  
dharma-saṁsthāpanārthāya* *sambhavāmi yuge yuge*

Lord Kṛṣṇa appears in every millennium for two purposes, namely to deliver the devotees and to kill the nondevotees. His devotees also have two similar purposes — to preach the *bhakti* cult of Kṛṣṇa consciousness and to defeat all kinds of agnostics and atheistic demons. Nityānanda Prabhu carried out the order of Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu in this way, and those who strictly follow Nityānanda Prabhu perform the same activities. There are two classes of devotees. One is called *goṣṭhy-ānandī,* and the other is called *bhajanānandī.* A devotee who does not preach but always engages in devotional activities is called a *bhajanānandī,* whereas a devotee who not only is expert in devotional service but who also preaches the cult of *bhakti* and defeats all kinds of agnostics is called a *goṣṭhy-anandī.*

In those days, and also even now, the palatial buildings of respectable people, especially in the villages of Bengal, were divided into two parts. The inside part was especially meant for the family, and the ladies would live there unexposed to men. That part was called the *bhitara-bāḍi,* or inside house. In the outside house, or *bahir-bāḍi,* the respectable gentleman received visitors and kept his business office. The Durgā-maṇḍapa would be part of the outside house. Thus when Lord Nityānanda entered the outside house, Rāmacandra Khān was in the inside house with the members of his family. When Nityānanda Prabhu arrived, Rāmacandra Khān did not receive Him personally but sent his servant to inform Him indirectly to go away.

### Translation

**He had handsome bodily features, and he was learned and youthful, but he could not tolerate the statement that simply by glimpsing the awakening of the Lord’s holy name one can attain liberation.**

### Purport

Vaiṣṇavas strictly follow the directions of the *śāstras* regarding how one can be liberated simply by a slight awakening of pure chanting of the holy name. Māyāvādīs cannot tolerate the statements of the *śāstras* about how easily liberation can be achieved, for, as stated in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (12.5), *kleśo ’dhikaratas teṣām avyaktāsakta-cetasām:* impersonalists must work hard for many, many births, and only then will they perhaps be liberated. Vaiṣṇavas know that simply by chanting the holy name of the Lord offenselessly, one achieves liberation as a by-product. Thus there is no need to endeavor separately for liberation. Śrīla Bilvamaṅgala Ṭhākura has said, *muktiḥ svayaṁ mukulitāñjali sevate ’smān:* liberation stands at one’s door, ready to render any kind of service, if one is a pure devotee with unflinching faith and reverence. This the Māyāvādīs cannot tolerate. Therefore the *ārindā pradhāna,* chief tax collector, although very learned, handsome and youthful, could not tolerate the statements of Haridāsa Ṭhākura.

The philosophy enunciated by the Māyāvādīs is called *ghaṭa-paṭiyā* (“pot-and-earth”) philosophy. According to this philosophy, everything is one. Such philosophers see no distinction between a pot made of earth and the earth itself, reasoning that anything made of earth, such as different pots, is also the same earth. Since Gopāla Cakravartī was a *ghaṭa-paṭiyā* logician, a gross materialist, what could he understand about the transcendental devotional service of the Lord?

From this statement by Haridāsa Ṭhākura, it is understood that a pure Vaiṣṇava never takes anyone’s insults seriously. This is the teaching of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu:

*tṛṇād api su-nīcena* *taror iva sahiṣṇunā  
amāninā māna-dena* *kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ*

“One should chant the holy name of the Lord in a humble state of mind, thinking oneself lower than the straw in the street. One should be more tolerant than a tree, devoid of all sense of false prestige and ready to offer all respects to others. In such a state of mind one can chant the holy name of the Lord constantly.” A Vaiṣṇava is always tolerant and submissive like trees and grass. He tolerates insults offered by others, for he is simply interested in chanting the holy name of the Lord without being disturbed.

### Translation

**A characteristic of a pure devotee is that he excuses any offense by an ignorant rascal. A characteristic of Kṛṣṇa, however, is that He cannot tolerate blasphemy of His devotees.**

### Purport

The characteristic of a Vaiṣṇava and the characteristic of the Lord mentioned in this verse are very significant. In His *Śikṣāṣṭaka* (3) Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu has taught the characteristics of a Vaiṣṇava:

*tṛṇād api su-nīcena* *taror iva sahiṣṇunā  
amāninā māna-dena* *kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ*

A Vaiṣṇava strictly follows this principle of being humbler than the grass and more tolerant than a tree, expecting no honor from others but offering honor to everyone. In this way, a Vaiṣṇava is simply interested in chanting about the Supreme Personality of Godhead and glorifying Him. Haridāsa Ṭhākura epitomized this foremost order of Vaiṣṇavism.

Kṛṣṇa, however, cannot tolerate any insults or blasphemy against a Vaiṣṇava. For example, Prahlāda Mahārāja was chastised by his father, Hiraṇyakaśipu, in so many ways, but although Prahlāda tolerated this, Kṛṣṇa did not. The Lord therefore came in the form of Nṛsiṁhadeva to kill Hiraṇyakaśipu. Similarly, although Śrīla Haridāsa Ṭhākura tolerated the insult by Gopāla Cakravartī, Kṛṣṇa could not. The Lord immediately punished Gopāla Cakravartī by making him suffer from leprosy. While instructing Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī about the many restrictive rules and regulations for Vaiṣṇavas, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu has very vividly described the effects of offenses at the lotus feet of a Vaiṣṇava. *Yadi vaiṣṇava-aparādha uṭhe hātī mātā* (*Madhya* 19.156). Offending or blaspheming a Vaiṣṇava has been described as the greatest offense, and it has been compared to a mad elephant. When a mad elephant enters a garden, it ruins all the creepers, flowers and trees. Similarly, if a devotee properly executing his devotional service becomes an offender at the lotus feet of his spiritual master or another Vaiṣṇava, his devotional service is spoiled.

### Translation

### Purport

While Haridāsa Ṭhākura was staying under the care of Advaita Ācārya, he was afraid of the behavior of the society in Śāntipura, Navadvīpa, which was full of exceedingly aristocratic *brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas* and *vaiśyas.* Haridāsa Ṭhākura was born in a Muslim family and was later recognized as a great Vaiṣṇava, but nevertheless the *brāhmaṇas* were very critical of him. Thus Haridāsa Ṭhākura was afraid that Advaita Ācārya would be put into some difficulty because of His familiarity with Haridāsa Ṭhākura. Śrī Advaita Ācārya treated Haridāsa Ṭhākura as a most elevated Vaiṣṇava, but others, like Rāmacandra Khān, were envious of Haridāsa Ṭhākura. Of course, we have to follow in the footsteps of Advaita Ācārya, not caring for people like Rāmacandra Khān. At present, many Vaiṣṇavas are coming to our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement from among the Europeans and Americans, and although men like Rāmacandra Khān are always envious of such Vaiṣṇavas, one should follow in the footsteps of Śrī Advaita Ācārya by treating all of them as Vaiṣṇavas. Although they are not as exalted as Haridāsa Ṭhākura, such Americans and Europeans, having accepted the principles of Vaiṣṇava philosophy and behavior, should never be excluded from Vaiṣṇava society.

### Translation

**Advaita Ācārya replied, “My dear Haridāsa, do not be afraid. I shall behave strictly according to the principles of the revealed scriptures.**

### Purport

Śrīla Advaita Ācārya was not afraid of the strict brahminical culture and customs of society. As stated in the śāstric injunctions, which are the true medium of evidence or proof, anyone can go back to Godhead, even if born of a low family. Kṛṣṇa says in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (9.32):

*māṁ hi pārtha vyapāśritya* *ye ’pi syuḥ pāpa-yonayaḥ  
striyo vaiśyās tathā śūdrās* *te ’pi yānti parāṁ gatim*

“O son of Pṛthā, those who take shelter in Me, though they be of lower birth — women, *vaiśyas* \merchants\] and *śūdras* \[workers\] — can attain the supreme destination.” Though having taken a low birth in human society, one who accepts Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead is quite competent to go back home, back to Godhead; and one who is a bona fide candidate for going back to Godhead should not be considered a lowborn person, or *caṇḍāla.* That is also a śāstric injunction. As stated in [*Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (2.4.18):

*kirāta-hūṇāndhra-pulinda-pulkaśā *
 *ābhīra-śumbhā yavanāḥ khasādayaḥ  
ye ’nye ca pāpā yad-apāśrayāśrayāḥ *
 *śudhyanti tasmai prabhaviṣṇave namaḥ*

Not only the *yavanas* and *khasādayaḥ* but even those born in still lower families can be purified (*śudhyanti*) by the grace of a devotee of Lord Kṛṣṇa, for Kṛṣṇa empowers such devotees to perform this purification. Advaita Ācārya had confidence in the śāstric evidence and did not care about social customs. The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, therefore, is a cultural movement that does not care about local social conventions. Following in the footsteps of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and Advaita Ācārya, we can accept a devotee from any part of the world and recognize him as a *brāhmaṇa* as soon as he is qualified due to following the principles of Vaiṣṇava behavior.

*tumi khāile haya koṭi-brāhmaṇa-bhojana”

### Synonyms

*tumi* *khāile* — if you eat; *haya* — there is; *koṭi*-*brāhmaṇa*-*bhojana* — feeding ten million *brāhmaṇas*; *eta* *bali* — saying this; *śrāddha*-*pātra* — the dish offered to the forefathers; *karāilā* *bhojana* — made to eat.

### Translation

**“Feeding you is equal to feeding ten million brāhmaṇas,” Advaita Ācārya said. “Therefore, accept this śrāddha-pātra.” Thus Advaita Ācārya made him eat.**

### Purport

*Śrāddha* is *prasādam* offered to the forefathers at a certain date of the year or month. The *śrāddha-pātra,* or plate offered to the forefathers, is then offered to the best of the *brāhmaṇas* in society. Instead of offering the *śrāddha-pātra* to any other *brāhmaṇa,* Advaita Ācārya offered it to Haridāsa Ṭhākura, considering him greater than any of the foremost *brāhmaṇas.* This act by Śrī Advaita Ācārya proves that Haridāsa Ṭhākura was always situated in a transcendental position and was therefore always greater than even the most exalted *brāhmaṇa,* for he was situated above the mode of goodness of the material world. Referring to the *Bhakti-sandarbha,* text 177, Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura quotes the following statements from the *Garuḍa Purāṇa* in this connection:

*brāhmaṇānāṁ sahasrebhyaḥ* *satra-yājī viśiṣyate  
satra-yāji-sahasrebhyaḥ* *sarva-vedānta-pāragaḥ*

*sarva-vedānta-vit-koṭyā* *viṣṇu-bhakto viśiṣyate  
vaiṣṇavānāṁ sahasrebhya* *ekānty eko viśiṣyate*

“A *brāhmaṇa* qualified to offer sacrifices is better than an ordinary *brāhmaṇa,* and better than such a *brāhmaṇa* is one who has studied all the Vedic scriptures. Among many such *brāhmaṇas,* one who is a devotee of Lord Viṣṇu is the best, and among many such Vaiṣṇavas, one who fully engages in the service of the Lord is the best.”

*bhaktir aṣṭa-vidhā hy eṣā* *yasmin mlecche ’pi vartate  
sa viprendro muni-śreṣṭhaḥ* *sa jñānī sa ca paṇḍitaḥ  
tasmai deyaṁ tato grāhyaṁ* *sa ca pūjyo yathā hariḥ*

“There are many different kinds of devotees, but even a Vaiṣṇava coming from a family of *mlecchas* or *yavanas* is understood to be a learned scholar, complete in knowledge, if he knows the Vaiṣṇava philosophy. He should therefore be given charity, for such a Vaiṣṇava is as worshipable as the Supreme Personality of Godhead.”

*na me ’bhaktaś catur-vedī* *mad-bhaktaḥ śva-pacaḥ priyaḥ  
tasmai deyaṁ tato grāhyaṁ* *sa ca pūjyo yathā hy aham*

Lord Kṛṣṇa says, “Even if a nondevotee comes from a *brāhmaṇa* family and is expert in studying the *Vedas,* he is not very dear to Me, whereas even if a sincere devotee comes from a low family of meat-eaters, he is very dear to Me. Such a sincere pure devotee should be given charity, for he is as worshipable as I.”

### Translation

**Advaita Ācārya was always absorbed in thoughts of how to deliver the fallen souls of the entire world. “The entire world is full of nondevotees,” He thought. “How will they be delivered?”**

### Purport

Śrīla Advaita Ācārya sets the standard for *ācāryas* in the Vaiṣṇava *sampradāya.* An *ācārya* must always be eager to deliver the fallen souls. A person who establishes a temple or *maṭha* to take advantage of people’s sentiments by using for his livelihood what people contribute for the worship of the Deity cannot be called a *gosvāmī* or *ācārya.* One who knows the conclusion of the *śāstras,* follows in the footsteps of his predecessors and endeavors to preach the *bhakti* cult all over the world is to be considered an *ācārya.* The role of an *ācārya* is not to earn his livelihood through the income of the temple. Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura used to say that if one earns his livelihood by displaying the Deity in the temple, he is not an *ācārya* or *gosvāmī.* It would be better for him to accept service even as a sweeper in the street, for that is a more honorable means of earning one’s living.

### Purport

In the *Bhagavad-gītā* (7.14) Lord Kṛṣṇa says:

*daivī hy eṣā guṇa-mayī* *mama māyā duratyayā  
mām eva ye prapadyante* *māyām etāṁ taranti te*

“This divine energy of Mine, consisting of the three modes of material nature, is difficult to overcome. But those who have surrendered unto Me can easily cross beyond it.” This was actually proved by the behavior of Haridāsa Ṭhākura. *Māyā* enchants the entire world. Indeed, people have forgotten the ultimate goal of life because of the dazzling attractions of the material world. But this dazzling attraction, especially the attractive beauty of a woman, is meant for persons who are not surrendered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord says, *mām eva ye prapadyante māyām etāṁ taranti te:* “One who is surrendered unto Me cannot be conquered by the illusory energy.” The illusory energy personally came to test Haridāsa Ṭhākura, but herein she admits her defeat, for she was unable to captivate him. How is this possible? It was because Haridāsa Ṭhākura, fully surrendered to the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, was always absorbed in thoughts of Kṛṣṇa by chanting the holy names of the Lord 300,000 times daily as a vow.

*brahmādi jīva, āmi sabāre mohiluṅ  
ekelā tomāre āmi mohite nāriluṅ*

### Synonyms

*brahma*-*ādi* *jīva* — all living entities, beginning from Lord Brahmā; *āmi* — I; *sabāre* *mohiluṅ* — captivated everyone; *ekelā* — alone; *tomāre* — you; *āmi* — I; *mohite* *nāriluṅ* — could not attract.

### Translation

**“I have previously captivated the mind of even Brahmā, what to speak of others. Your mind alone have I failed to attract.**

### Purport

Beginning from Lord Brahmā down to the insignificant ant, everyone, without exception, is attracted by the illusory energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The demigods, human beings, animals, birds, beasts, trees and plants are all attracted by sexual desire. That is the illusion of *māyā.* Everyone, whether man or woman, thinks that he is the enjoyer of the illusory energy. In this way, everyone is captivated and engaged in material activities. However, because Haridāsa Ṭhākura was always thinking of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and was always busy satisfying the senses of the Lord, this process alone saved him from the captivation of *māyā.* This is practical proof of the strength of devotional service. Because of his full engagement in the service of the Lord, he could not be induced to enjoy *māyā.* The verdict of the *śāstras* is that a pure Vaiṣṇava, or devotee of the Lord, never thinks of enjoying the material world, which culminates in sex life. He never thinks himself an enjoyer; instead, he always wants to be enjoyed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore the conclusion is that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is eternal, transcendental, beyond the perception of sense gratification and beyond the material qualities. Only if a living entity gives up the false conception that the body is the self and always thinks himself an eternal servant of Kṛṣṇa and the Vaiṣṇavas can he surpass the influence of *māyā* (*mām eva ye prapadyante māyām etāṁ taranti te*). A pure living entity who thus attains the stage of *anartha-nivṛtti,* cessation of everything unwanted, has nothing to enjoy in the material world. One attains this stage only by properly performing the functions of devotional service. Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī has written:

*ādau śraddhā tataḥ sādhu-* *saṅgo ’tha bhajana-kriyā  
tato ’nartha-nivṛttiḥ syāt* *tato niṣṭhā rucis tataḥ*

“In the beginning one must have a preliminary desire for self-realization. This will bring one to the stage of trying to associate with persons who are spiritually elevated. In the next stage, one becomes initiated by an elevated spiritual master, and under his instruction the neophyte devotee begins the process of devotional service. By execution of devotional service under the guidance of the spiritual master, one becomes freed from all material attachments, attains steadiness in self-realization and acquires a taste for hearing about the Absolute Personality of Godhead, Śrī Kṛṣṇa.” (*Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu* 1.4.15) If one is actually executing devotional service, then *anarthas,* the unwanted things associated with material enjoyment, will automatically disappear.

### Translation

**“The holy name of Lord Rāma certainly gives liberation, but the holy name of Kṛṣṇa transports one to the other side of the ocean of nescience and at last gives one ecstatic love of Kṛṣṇa.**

### Purport

In an indirect way, this verse explains the chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra.* The Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra* — Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare — includes both the holy name of Lord Kṛṣṇa and the name of Lord Rāma. Lord Rāma gives one the opportunity to be liberated, but simply by liberation one does not get actual spiritual benefit. Sometimes if one is liberated from the material world but has no shelter at the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, one falls down to the material world again. Liberation is like a state of convalescence, in which one is free from a fever but is still not healthy. Even in the stage of convalescence, if one is not very careful, one may have a relapse. Similarly, liberation does not offer as much security as the shelter of the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa. It is stated in the *śāstra:*

*ye ’nye ’ravindākṣa vimukta-māninas *
 *tvayy asta-bhāvād aviśuddha-buddhayaḥ  
āruhya kṛcchreṇa paraṁ padaṁ tataḥ *
 *patanty adho ’nādṛta-yuṣmad-aṅghrayaḥ*

“O Lord, the intelligence of those who think themselves liberated but who have no devotion is impure. Even though they rise to the highest point of liberation by dint of severe penances and austerities, they are sure to fall down again into material existence, for they do not take shelter at Your lotus feet.” (*Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* 10.2.32) *Yuṣmad-aṅghrayaḥ* refers to the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa. If one does not take shelter of Kṛṣṇa’s lotus feet, he falls down (*patanty adhaḥ*), even from liberation. The Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra,* however, gives liberation and at the same time offers shelter at the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa. If one takes shelter at the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa after liberation, he develops his dormant ecstatic love for Kṛṣṇa. That is the highest perfection of life.
