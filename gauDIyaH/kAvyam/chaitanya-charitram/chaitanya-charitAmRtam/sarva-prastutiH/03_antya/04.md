CHAPTER FOUR

The fourth chapter is summarized by Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura in his *Amṛta-pravāha-bhāṣya* as follows. Śrīla Sanātana Gosvāmī came alone from Mathurā to Jagannātha Purī to see Lord Caitanya. Because of bathing in bad water and not getting enough food every day while traveling on the path through Jhārikhaṇḍa (Jharkhand) Forest, he developed a disease that made his body itch. Suffering greatly from this itching, he resolved that in the presence of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu he would throw himself under the wheel of Jagannātha’s car and in this way commit suicide.

When Sanātana Gosvāmī came to Jagannātha Purī, he stayed under the care of Haridāsa Ṭhākura for some time, and Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was very happy to see him. The Lord informed Sanātana Gosvāmī about the death of his younger brother Anupama, who had great faith in the lotus feet of Lord Rāmacandra. One day Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu said to Sanātana Gosvāmī, “Your decision to commit suicide is the result of the mode of ignorance. One cannot get love of God simply by committing suicide. You have already dedicated your life and body to My service; therefore your body does not belong to you, nor do you have any right to commit suicide. I have to execute many devotional services through your body. I want you to preach the cult of devotional service and go to Vṛndāvana to excavate the lost holy places.” After having thus spoken, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu left, and Haridāsa Ṭhākura and Sanātana Gosvāmī had many talks about this subject.

One day Sanātana Gosvāmī was summoned by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, who wanted him to come to Yameśvara-ṭoṭā. Sanātana Gosvāmī reached the Lord through the path along the beach by the sea. When Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu asked Sanātana Gosvāmī which way he had come, Sanātana replied, “Many servitors of Lord Jagannātha come and go on the path by the Siṁha-dvāra gate of the Jagannātha temple. Therefore, I did not go by that path, but instead went by the beach.” Sanātana Gosvāmī did not realize that there were burning blisters on his feet because of the heat of the sand. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was pleased to hear about Sanātana Gosvāmī’s great respect for the temple of Lord Śrī Jagannātha.

Because his disease produced wet sores on his body, Sanātana Gosvāmī used to avoid embracing Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, but nevertheless the Lord would embrace him by force. This made Sanātana Gosvāmī very unhappy, and therefore he consulted Jagadānanda Paṇḍita about what he should do. Jagadānanda advised him to return to Vṛndāvana after the car festival of Jagannātha, but when Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu heard about this instruction, He chastised Jagadānanda Paṇḍita and reminded him that Sanātana Gosvāmī was senior to him and also more learned. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu informed Sanātana Gosvāmī that because Sanātana was a pure devotee, the Lord was never inconvenienced by his bodily condition. Because the Lord was a *sannyāsī,* He did not consider one body better than another. The Lord also informed him that He was maintaining Sanātana and the other devotees just like a father. Therefore the moisture oozing from Sanātana’s itching skin did not affect the Lord at all. After speaking with Sanātana Gosvāmī in this way, the Lord again embraced him, and after this embrace, Sanātana Gosvāmī became free from the disease. The Lord ordered Sanātana Gosvāmī to stay with Him for that year, and the next year, after seeing the Ratha-yātrā festival, he left Puruṣottama-kṣetra and returned to Vṛndāvana.

After meeting Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Śrī Rūpa Gosvāmī also returned to Bengal, where he remained for one year. Whatever money he owned, he distributed among his relatives, the *brāhmaṇas* and the temples. In this way he completely retired and returned to Vṛndāvana to meet Sanātana Gosvāmī.

After narrating these incidents, Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī has given a list of the main books of Sanātana Gosvāmī, Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī and Jīva Gosvāmī.

*viprāt* — than a *brāhmaṇa*; *dvi*-*ṣaṭ*-*guṇa*-*yutāt* — who has twelve brahminical qualifications; *aravinda*-*nābha* — of Lord Viṣṇu, who has a lotuslike navel; *pāda*-*aravinda* — unto the lotus feet; *vimukhāt* — than a person bereft of devotion; *śva*-*pacam* — a *caṇḍāla,* or a person accustomed to eating dogs; *variṣṭham* — more glorified; *manye* — I think; *tat*-*arpita* — dedicated unto Him; *manaḥ* — mind; *vacana* — words; *īhita* — activities; *artha* — wealth; *prāṇam* — life; *punāti* — purifies; *saḥ* — he; *kulam* — his family; *na* *tu* — but not; *bhūri*-*mānaḥ* — a *brāhmaṇa* proud of possessing such qualities.

### Translation

**“ ‘One may be born in a brāhmaṇa family and have all twelve brahminical qualities, but if in spite of being thus qualified he is not devoted to the lotus feet of Lord Kṛṣṇa, who has a navel shaped like a lotus, he is not as good as a caṇḍāla who has dedicated his mind, words, activities, wealth and life to the service of the Lord. Simply to take birth in a brāhmaṇa family or to have brahminical qualities is not sufficient. One must be a pure devotee of the Lord. Thus if a śva-paca, or caṇḍāla, is a devotee, he delivers not only himself but his entire family as well, whereas a brāhmaṇa who is not a devotee but simply has brahminical qualifications cannot even purify himself, what to speak of his family.’**

*bhajanera madhye śreṣṭha nava-vidhā bhakti  
‘kṛṣṇa-prema’, ‘kṛṣṇa’ dite dhare mahā-śakti*

### Synonyms

*bhajanera* *madhye* — in executing devotional service; *śreṣṭha* — the best; *nava*-*vidhā* *bhakti* — the nine prescribed methods of devotional service; *kṛṣṇa*-*prema* — ecstatic love of Kṛṣṇa; *kṛṣṇa* — and Kṛṣṇa; *dite* — to deliver; *dhare* — possess; *mahā*-*śakti* — great potency.

### Translation

**“Among the ways of executing devotional service, the nine prescribed methods are the best, for these processes have great potency to deliver Kṛṣṇa and ecstatic love for Him.**

### Purport

The nine kinds of devotional service are mentioned in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (7.5.23):

*śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ* *smaraṇaṁ pāda-sevanam  
arcanaṁ vandanaṁ dāsyaṁ* *sakhyam ātma-nivedanam*

These nine are hearing, chanting, remembering Kṛṣṇa, offering service to Kṛṣṇa’s lotus feet, offering worship in the temple, offering prayers, working as a servant, making friendship with Kṛṣṇa and unreservedly surrendering to Kṛṣṇa. These nine processes of devotional service can grant one Kṛṣṇa and ecstatic love for Him. In the beginning one has to discharge devotional service according to regulative principles, but gradually, as devotional service becomes one’s life and soul, one achieves the most exalted position of ecstatic love for Kṛṣṇa. Ultimately, Kṛṣṇa is the goal of life. One need not have taken birth in an aristocratic *brāhmaṇa* family to attain the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, nor is a person born in a low family unfit for achieving Kṛṣṇa’s lotus feet. In *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (3.33.7) Devahūti says to Kapiladeva:

*aho bata śva-paco ’to garīyān *
 *yaj-jihvāgre vartate nāma tubhyam  
tepus tapas te juhuvuḥ sasnur āryā *
 *brahmānūcur nāma gṛṇanti ye te*

“O my Lord, even a person born in a low family of dog-eaters is glorious if he always chants the holy name of the Lord. Such a person has already performed all types of austerities, penances and Vedic sacrifices, has already bathed in the sacred rivers, and has also studied all the Vedic literature. Thus he has become an exalted personality.” Similarly, Kuntīdevī says to Lord Kṛṣṇa:

*janmaiśvarya-śruta-śrībhir* *edhamāna-madaḥ pumān  
naivārhaty abhidhātuṁ vai* *tvām akiñcana-gocaram*

“A person who is proud of his birth, opulence, knowledge and beauty cannot achieve Your lotus feet. You are available only to the humble and meek, not to the proud.” (*Bhāg.* 1.8.26.)

### Verse text

*tāra madhye sarva-śreṣṭha nāma-saṅkīrtana  
niraparādhe nāma laile pāya prema-dhana*

### Synonyms

*tāra* *madhye* — of the nine different types of devotional service; *sarva*-*śreṣṭha* — the most important of all; *nāma*-*saṅkīrtana* — chanting of the holy name of the Lord; *niraparādhe* — without offenses; *nāma* *laile* — if one chants the holy name; *pāya* — he gets; *prema*-*dhana* — the most valuable ecstatic love of Kṛṣṇa.

### Translation

**“Of the nine processes of devotional service, the most important is to always chant the holy name of the Lord. If one does so, avoiding the ten kinds of offenses, one very easily obtains the most valuable love of Godhead.”**

### Purport

Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī Prabhu gives the following directions in his *Bhakti-sandarbha* (270):

*iyaṁ ca kīrtanākhyā bhaktir bhagavato dravya-jāti-guṇa-kriyābhir dīna-janaika-viṣayāpāra-karuṇā-mayīti śruti-purāṇādi-viśrutiḥ. ata eva kalau svabhāvata evāti-dīneṣu lokeṣu āvirbhūya tān anāyāsenaiva tat-tad-yuga-gata-mahā-sādhanānāṁ sarvam eva phalaṁ dadānā sā kṛtārthayati. yata eva tayaiva kalau bhagavato viśeṣataś ca santoṣo bhavati.*

“Chanting the holy name is the chief means of attaining love of Godhead. This chanting or devotional service does not depend on any paraphernalia, nor on one’s having taken birth in a good family. By humility and meekness one attracts the attention of Kṛṣṇa. That is the verdict of all the *Vedas.* Therefore if one becomes very humble and meek, he can easily attain the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa in this Age of Kali. That is the fulfillment of all great sacrifices, penances and austerities because when one achieves ecstatic love of Godhead, he attains the complete perfection of life. Therefore whatever one does in executing devotional service must be accompanied by the chanting of the holy name of the Lord.” The chanting of the holy name of Kṛṣṇa — Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare — has been praised by Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī in his *Nāmāṣṭaka* (verse 1):

*nikhila-śruti-mauli-ratna-mālā- *
 *dyuti-nīrājita-pāda-paṅkajānta  
ayi mukta-kulair upāsyamānaṁ *
 *paritas tvāṁ hari-nāma saṁśrayāmi*

“O Hari-nāma! The tips of the toes of Your lotus feet are constantly being worshiped by the glowing radiance emanating from the string of gems known as the *Upaniṣads,* the crown jewels of all the *Vedas.* You are eternally adored by liberated souls such as Nārada and Śukadeva. O Hari-nāma! I take complete shelter of You.”

Similarly, Śrīla Sanātana Gosvāmī has praised the chanting of the holy name as follows in his *Bṛhad-bhāgavatāmṛta* (part one, chapter One, verse 9):

*jayati jayati nāmānanda-rūpaṁ murārer *
 *viramita-nija-dharma-dhyāna-pūjādi-yatnam  
katham api sakṛd āttaṁ mukti-daṁ prāṇināṁ yat *
 *paramam amṛtam ekaṁ jīvanaṁ bhūṣaṇaṁ me*

“All glories, all glories to the all-blissful holy name of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, which causes the devotee to give up all conventional religious duties, meditation and worship. When somehow or other uttered even once by a living entity, the holy name awards him liberation. The holy name of Kṛṣṇa is the highest nectar. It is my very life and my only treasure.”

In *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (2.1.11) Śukadeva Gosvāmī says:

*etan nirvidyamānānām* *icchatām akuto-bhayam  
yogināṁ nṛpa nirṇītaṁ* *harer nāmānukīrtanam*

“O King, constant chanting of the holy name of the Lord after the ways of the great authorities is the doubtless and fearless way of success for all, including those who are free from all material desires, those who are desirous of all material enjoyment, and those who are self-satisfied by dint of transcendental knowledge.”

In *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (6.3.22) Yamarāja says:

*etāvān eva loke ’smin* *puṁsāṁ dharmaḥ paraḥ smṛtaḥ  
bhakti-yogo bhagavati* *tan-nāma-grahaṇādibhiḥ*

“Devotional service, beginning with the chanting of the holy name of the Lord, is the ultimate religious principle for the living entity in human society.”

Similarly, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu has said in His *Śikṣāṣṭaka* (3):

*tṛṇād api su-nīcena* *taror iva sahiṣṇunā  
amāninā māna-dena* *kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ*

“One should chant the holy name of the Lord in a humble state of mind, thinking oneself lower than the straw in the street. One should be more tolerant than a tree, devoid of all sense of false prestige and ready to offer all respect to others. In such a state of mind one can chant the holy name of the Lord constantly.” Regarding the ten offenses in chanting the holy name, one may refer to *Ādi-līlā,* chapter eight, verse 24.

### Purport

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu wanted to accomplish many purposes through the exegetical endeavors of Śrīla Sanātana Gosvāmī. First Sanātana Gosvāmī compiled the book called *Bṛhad-bhāgavatāmṛta* to teach people how to become devotees, execute devotional service and attain love of Kṛṣṇa. Second, he compiled the *Hari-bhakti-vilāsa,*wherein he collected authoritative scriptural injunctions regarding how a Vaiṣṇava should behave. Only by the endeavors of Śrī Sanātana Gosvāmī were all the lost places of pilgrimage in the Vṛndāvana area excavated. He established Madana-mohana, the first Deity in the Vṛndāvana area, and by his personal behavior he taught how one should act in the renounced order, completely devoted to the service of the Lord. By his personal example, he taught people how to stay in Vṛndāvana to execute devotional service. The principal mission of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was to preach Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Mathurā and Vṛndāvana are the abodes of Lord Kṛṣṇa. Therefore these two places are very dear to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and He wanted to develop their glories through Sanātana Gosvāmī.

*āmāra ei deha prabhura kārye nā lāgila  
bhārata-bhūmite janmi’ ei deha vyartha haila”*

### Synonyms

*āmāra* — my; *ei* — this; *deha* — body; *prabhura* — of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu; *kārye* — in the service; *nā* *lāgila* — could not be used; *bhārata*-*bhūmite* — in the land of India; *janmi’* — taking birth; *ei* *deha* — this body; *vyartha* *haila* — has become useless.

### Translation

**“My body could not be used in the service of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Therefore although it took birth in the land of India, this body has been useless.”**

### Purport

For a further explanation of the importance of Bhārata-bhūmi, one may refer to *Ādi-līlā* 9.41 and also *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* 5.19.19-27. The special feature of a birth in India is that a person born in India becomes automatically God conscious. In every part of India, and especially in the holy places of pilgrimage, even an ordinary uneducated man is inclined toward Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and as soon as he sees a Kṛṣṇa conscious person, he offers obeisances. India has many sacred rivers, such as the Ganges, Yamunā, Narmadā, Kāverī and Kṛṣṇā, and simply by bathing in these rivers people are liberated and become Kṛṣṇa conscious. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu therefore says:

*bhārata-bhūmite haila manuṣya-janma yāra  
janma sārthaka kari’ kara para-upakāra*

One who has taken birth in the land of Bhārata-bhūmi, India, should take full advantage of his birth. He should become completely well versed in the knowledge of the *Vedas* and spiritual culture and should distribute the experience of Kṛṣṇa consciousness all over the world. People all over the world are madly engaging in sense gratification and in this way spoiling their human lives, with the risk that in the next life they may become animals or less. Human society should be saved from such a risky civilization and the danger of animalism by awakening to God consciousness, Kṛṣṇa consciousness. The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement has been started for this purpose. Therefore unbiased men of the highest echelon should study the principles of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement and fully cooperate with this movement to save human society.

### Translation

### Purport

Sanātana Gosvāmī clearly defines herein the bona fide spiritual master of the world. The qualifications expressed in this connection are that one must act according to the scriptural injunctions and at the same time preach. One who does so is a bona fide spiritual master. Haridāsa Ṭhākura was the ideal spiritual master because he regularly chanted on his beads a prescribed number of times. Indeed, he was chanting the holy name of the Lord 300,000 times a day. Similarly, the members of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement chant a minimum of sixteen rounds a day, which can be done without difficulty, and at the same time they must preach the cult of Caitanya Mahāprabhu according to the gospel of *Bhagavad-gītā As It Is.* One who does so is quite fit to become a spiritual master for the entire world.

### Translation

**Sanātana Gosvāmī replied, “You have given me very good advice. I shall certainly go there, for that is the place the Lord has given me for my residence.”**

### Purport

The words *prabhu-datta deśa* are very significant. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s devotional cult teaches one not to sit down in one place but to spread the devotional cult all over the world. The Lord dispatched Sanātana Gosvāmī and Rūpa Gosvāmī to Vṛndāvana to excavate and renovate the holy places and from there establish the cult of *bhakti.* Therefore Vṛndāvana was given to Sanātana Gosvāmī and Rūpa Gosvāmī as their place of residence. Similarly, everyone in the line of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s devotional cult should accept the words of the spiritual master and thus spread the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. They should go everywhere, to all parts of the world, accepting those places as their *prabhu-datta deśa,* the places of residence given by the spiritual master or Lord Kṛṣṇa. The spiritual master is the representative of Lord Kṛṣṇa; therefore one who has carried out the orders of the spiritual master is understood to have carried out the orders of Kṛṣṇa or Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu wanted to spread the *bhakti* cult all over the world (*pṛthivīte āche yata nagarādi grāma*). Therefore devotees in the line of Kṛṣṇa consciousness must go to different parts of the world and preach, as ordered by the spiritual master. That will satisfy Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

### Purport

Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura gives his opinion about how a person completely engaged in the service of the Lord transforms his body from material to transcendental. He says, “A pure devotee engaged in the service of Lord Kṛṣṇa has no desire for his personal sense gratification, and thus he never accepts anything for that purpose. He desires only the happiness of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, and because of his ecstatic love for Kṛṣṇa, he acts in various ways. *Karmīs* think that the material body is an instrument for material enjoyment, and that is why they work extremely hard. A devotee, however, has no such desires. A devotee always engages wholeheartedly in the service of the Lord, forgetting about bodily conceptions and bodily activities. The body of a *karmī* is called material because the *karmī,* being too absorbed in material activities, is always eager to enjoy material facilities, but the body of a devotee who tries his best to work very hard for the satisfaction of Kṛṣṇa by fully engaging in the Lord’s service must be accepted as transcendental. Whereas *karmīs* are interested only in the personal satisfaction of their senses, devotees work for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord. Therefore one who cannot distinguish between devotion and ordinary *karma* may mistakenly consider the body of a pure devotee material. One who knows does not commit such a mistake. Nondevotees who consider devotional activities and ordinary material activities to be on the same level are offenders to the chanting of the transcendental holy name of the Lord. A pure devotee knows that a devotee’s body, being always transcendental, is just suitable for rendering service to the Lord.

“A devotee on the topmost platform of devotional service always humbly thinks that he is not rendering any devotional service. He thinks that he is poor in devotional service and that his body is material. On the other hand, those known as the *sahajiyās* foolishly think that their material bodies are transcendental. Because of this, they are always bereft of the association of pure devotees, and thus they cannot behave like Vaiṣṇavas. Observing the defects of the *sahajiyās,* Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura has sung as follows in his book *Kalyāṇa-kalpataru:*

*āmi ta’ vaiṣṇava,* *e-buddhi ha-ile,  
amānī nā haba āmi  
pratiṣṭhāśā āsi’,* *hṛdaya dūṣibe,  
ha-iba niraya-gāmī  
nije śreṣṭha jāni’,* *ucchiṣṭādi-dāne,  
habe abhimāna bhāra  
tāi śiṣya tava,* *thākiyā sarvadā,  
nā la-iba pūjā kāra*

“ ‘If I think I am a Vaiṣṇava, I shall look forward to receiving respect from others. And if the desire for fame and reputation pollutes my heart, certainly I shall go to hell. By giving others the remnants of my food, I shall consider myself superior and shall be burdened with the weight of false pride. Therefore, always remaining your surrendered disciple, I shall not accept worship from anyone else.’ Śrīla Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī has written (*Antya-līlā* 20.28):

*premera svabhāva — yāhāṅ premera sambandha  
sei māne, — ‘kṛṣṇe mora nāhi prema-gandha’*

“ ‘Wherever there is a relationship of love of Godhead, the natural symptoms are that the devotee does not think himself a devotee, but always thinks that he has not even a drop of love for Kṛṣṇa.’ ”

### Purport

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu told Sanātana Gosvāmī, “Since you are a Vaiṣṇava, your body is spiritual, not material.

Therefore even if your body were material, a *sannyāsī* should see no distinction between a good body and a bad body.”

### Translation

**“In the material world, conceptions of good and bad are all mental speculations. Therefore, saying ‘This is good’ and ‘This is bad’ is all a mistake.**

### Purport

Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the Absolute Truth, ever existing with different varieties of energies. When one is absorbed in the illusory energy of Kṛṣṇa and cannot understand Kṛṣṇa, one cannot ascertain what is good for him and what is bad. Conceptions of good and bad are all imaginations or mental speculations. When one forgets that he is an eternal servant of Kṛṣṇa, he wants to enjoy the material world through different plans. At that time he distinguishes between material plans that are good and those that are bad. Actually, however, they are all false.

### Translation

**“Since I am in the renounced order, My duty is to make no distinctions and be equipoised. My knowledge must be equally disposed toward sandalwood pulp and dirty mud.**

### Purport

It is the duty of a *sannyāsī,* a person in the renounced order, to be always equipoised, and that is also the duty of a learned man and a Vaiṣṇava. A Vaiṣṇava, a *sannyāsī* or a learned person has no conception of the material world; in other words, he has no conception of anything materially important. He has no desire to use sandalwood pulp for sense gratification, nor does sense gratification make him hate mud. Acceptance or rejection of material things is not the concern of a *sannyāsī,* a Vaiṣṇava or a learned person. An advanced devotee has no desire to enjoy or reject anything. His only duty is to accept whatever is favorable for the advancement of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. A Vaiṣṇava should be indifferent to material enjoyment and renunciation and should always hanker for the spiritual life of rendering service to the Lord.

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is trying to convince Haridāsa Ṭhākura and Sanātana Gosvāmī that a devotee whose life is dedicated to the service of the Lord is never in the material conception.

One should never consider his body material, just as one should never consider the body of the Deity worshiped in the temple to be made of stone or wood. Factually, the Deity is directly the Supreme Personality of Godhead, without a doubt. The injunctions of the *Padma Purāṇa* therefore state, *arcye viṣṇau śilā-dhīr guruṣu nara-matir vaiṣṇave jāti-buddhiḥ* *.* *.* *.* *yasya vā nārakī saḥ*: “That person is a resident of hell who considers the Deity worshiped in the temple to be stone or wood, who considers the spiritual master an ordinary man, and who thinks that the body of a Vaiṣṇava fully dedicated to the service of the Lord belongs to the material modes of nature.”

In this way he becomes fit to enjoy the spiritual bliss derived from exchanging loving mellows with Me.’**

### Purport

This is a quotation from *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (11.29.34). At the time of initiation, a devotee gives up all his material conceptions. Therefore, being in touch with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he is situated on the transcendental platform. Thus having attained knowledge and the spiritual platform, he always engages in the service of the spiritual body of Kṛṣṇa. When one is freed from material connections in this way, his body immediately becomes spiritual, and Kṛṣṇa accepts his service. However, Kṛṣṇa does not accept anything from a person with a material conception of life. When a devotee no longer has any desire for material sense gratification, in his spiritual identity he engages in the service of the Lord, for his dormant spiritual consciousness awakens. This awakening of spiritual consciousness makes his body spiritual, and thus he becomes fit to render service to the Lord. *Karmīs* may consider the body of a devotee material, but factually it is not, for a devotee has no conception of material enjoyment. If one thinks that the body of a pure devotee is material, he is an offender, for that is a *vaiṣṇava-aparādha.* In this connection one should consult Śrīla Sanātana Gosvāmī’s *Bṛhad-bhāgavatāmṛta* (1.3.45 and 2.3.139).

### Purport

An associate of the Lord is one whose body is fully engaged in the service of the Lord. A materialist might see Sanātana Gosvāmī’s body as being full of itching sores that exuded foul moisture and a bad smell. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, however, said that actually the aroma of his body was the excellent scent of a mixture of sandalwood pulp, camphor, musk and *aguru.* In the *Garuḍa Purāṇa* this mixture, which is called *catuḥsama,* is described as follows:

*kastūrikāyā dvau bhāgau* *catvāraś candanasya tu  
kuṅkumasya trayaś caikaḥ* *śaśinaḥ syāt catuḥ-samam*

“Two parts of musk, four parts of sandalwood, three parts of *aguru* or saffron and one part of camphor, when mixed together, form *catuḥsama.*” The aroma of *catuḥsama* is very pleasing. It is also mentioned in the *Hari-bhakti-vilāsa* (sixth *vilāsa*).

“When will Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī Prabhupāda, who has established within the material world the mission to fulfill the desire of Lord Caitanya, give me shelter under his lotus feet?” Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī and Sanātana Gosvāmī were previously ministers directly in charge of the government of Nawab Hussain Shah, and they were also householders, but later they became *gosvāmīs.* A *gosvāmī,* therefore, is one who executes the will of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. The title *gosvāmī* is not an inherited designation; it is meant for a person who has controlled his sense gratification and dedicated his life to executing the order of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

Later, Gopāla Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmī produced a shortened version of it and added the *Dig-darśinī-ṭīkā.* In the *Hari-bhakti-vilāsa* there are so many quotations from the *sātvata* scriptures that sometimes it is inquired how the atheistic *smārtas* can refuse to accept them and instead imagine some other opinions. What is recorded in the *Hari-bhakti-vilāsa* strictly follows the Vedic scriptures and is certainly pure, but the attitude of the *karmīs* is always one of giving up the conclusion of pure Vaiṣṇava understanding. Because the *karmīs* are very much attached to the world and material activities, they always try to establish atheistic principles that oppose the understanding of the Vaiṣṇavas.”
