CHAPTER FIVE

Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura gives the following summary of the fifth chapter in his *Amṛta-pravāha-bhāṣya.* After passing through Yājapura, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu reached the town of Kaṭaka (Cuttack) and there went to see the temple of Sākṣi-gopāla. While there, He heard the story of Sākṣi-gopāla from the mouth of Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu.

Once there were two *brāhmaṇas,* one elderly and the other young, who were inhabitants of a place known as Vidyānagara. After touring many places of pilgrimage, the two *brāhmaṇas* finally reached Vṛndāvana. The elderly *brāhmaṇa* was very satisfied with the service of the young *brāhmaṇa,* and he wanted to offer him his youngest daughter in marriage. The young *brāhmaṇa* received the promise of his elder before the Gopāla Deity of Vṛndāvana. Thus the Gopāla Deity acted as a witness. When the two *brāhmaṇas* returned to Vidyānagara, the younger *brāhmaṇa* raised the question of this marriage, but the elderly *brāhmaṇa,* due to obligations to his friends and wife, answered that he could not remember his promise. Because of this, the younger *brāhmaṇa* returned to Vṛndāvana and narrated the whole story to Gopālajī. Thus Gopālajī, being obliged by the young man’s devotional service, accompanied him to southern India. Gopālajī followed the younger *brāhmaṇa,* who could hear the tinkling sound of Gopālajī’s ankle bells. When all the respectable gentlemen of Vidyānagara were assembled, Gopālajī testified to the promise of the elderly *brāhmaṇa.* Thus the marriage was performed. Later, the king of that country constructed a fine temple for Gopāla.

Afterwards, King Puruṣottama-deva of Orissa was insulted by the King of Vidyānagara, who refused to give him his daughter in marriage and called him a sweeper of Lord Jagannātha. With the help of Lord Jagannātha, King Puruṣottama-deva fought the King of Vidyānagara and defeated him. Thus he took charge of both the King’s daughter and his kingdom as well. At that time, Gopālajī, being very much obligated by the devotional service of King Puruṣottama-deva, was brought to the town of Kaṭaka.

After hearing this narration, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu visited the temple of Gopāla in great ecstasy of love of God. From Kaṭaka He went to Bhuvaneśvara and saw the temple of Lord Śiva. In this way, He gradually arrived at Kamalapura, and on the banks of the Bhārgī River He came to the temple of Lord Śiva, where He entrusted His *sannyāsa* staff to Nityānanda Prabhu. However, Nityānanda Prabhu broke the staff into three pieces and threw it into the Bhārgī River at a place known as Āṭhāranālā. Being angry at not getting His staff back, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu left the company of Nityānanda Prabhu and went alone to see the Jagannātha temple.

### Purport

The Sākṣi-gopāla temple is situated between the Khurdā Road railway station and the Jagannātha Purī station. The Deity is not presently situated in Kaṭaka, but when Nityānanda Prabhu traveled there, the Deity was present. Kaṭaka is a town in Orissa situated on the Mahānadī River. When Sākṣi-gopāla was brought from Vidyānagara in southern India, He stayed for some time at Kaṭaka. Thereafter, He was situated for some time in the Jagannātha temple. It seems that in the temple of Jagannātha there was some disagreement between Jagannātha and Sākṣi-gopāla, a disagreement called *prema-kalaha,* a quarrel of love. In order to settle this love quarrel, the King of Orissa constructed a village about eleven miles from Jagannātha Purī. The village was called Satyavādī, and Gopāla was stationed there. Thereafter, a new temple was constructed. Now there is a Sākṣi-gopāla station, and people go to Satyavādī to see the witness Gopāla.

महाकुलीन तुमि — विद्या-धनादि-प्रवीण ।  
आमि अकुलीन, आर धन-विद्या-हीन ॥ २२ ॥

### Verse text

*mahā-kulīna tumi — vidyā-dhanādi-pravīṇa  
āmi akulīna, āra dhana-vidyā-hīna*

### Synonyms

*mahā*-*kulīna* — highly aristocratic; *tumi* — you; *vidyā* — education; *dhana*-*ādi* — riches; *pravīṇa* — enriched; *āmi* — I; *akulīna* — not aristocratic; *āra* — and; *dhana*-*vidyā*-*hīna* — without any wealth and education.

### Translation

**“You are a most aristocratic family man, well educated and very rich. I am not at all aristocratic, and I am without a decent education and have no wealth.**

### Purport

Due to pious activities, one can be enriched by four opulences: one may obtain birth in an aristocratic family, become highly educated, become very beautiful or get a sufficient quantity of riches. These are symptoms of pious activities performed in one’s past life. In India it is still current for an aristocratic family never to consider a marriage with a common family. Though the caste may be the same, to maintain the aristocracy such marriages are rejected. No poor man will dare marry the daughter of a rich man. Because of this, when the elderly *brāhmaṇa* offered the young *brāhmaṇa* his daughter, the young *brāhmaṇa* did not believe that it would be possible to marry her. Therefore he asked the elderly *brāhmaṇa* why he was proposing something unprecedented (*asambhava*)*.* It was unheard of for an aristocratic person to offer his daughter to a person who was both uneducated and poor.

कन्यादान-पात्र आमि ना हइ तोमार ।  
कृष्णप्रीत्ये करि तोमार सेवा-व्यवहार ॥ २३ ॥

### Verse text

*kanyā-dāna-pātra āmi nā ha-i tomāra  
kṛṣṇa-prītye kari tomāra sevā-vyavahāra*

### Synonyms

*kanyā*-*dāna*-*pātra* — a bridegroom suitable for one’s daughter; *āmi* — I; *nā* — not; *ha*-*i* — am; *tomāra* — of you; *kṛṣṇa*-*prītye* — only for satisfaction of Kṛṣṇa; *kari* — I do; *tomāra* — of you; *sevā* — of service; *vyavahāra* — activities.

### Translation

**“Sir, I am not a suitable bridegroom for your daughter. I render service to you only for the satisfaction of Kṛṣṇa.**

### Purport

Both *brāhmaṇas* were pure Vaiṣṇavas. The younger man took special care of the older one simply to please Kṛṣṇa. In *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (11.19.21) Kṛṣṇa says, *mad-bhakta-pūjābhyadhikā:* “It is better to render service to My devotee.” Thus, according to the Gauḍīya-Vaiṣṇava philosophy of Caitanya Mahāprabhu, it is better to be a servant of the servant of God. One should not try to serve Kṛṣṇa directly. A pure Vaiṣṇava serves a servant of Kṛṣṇa and identifies himself as a servant of a servant of Kṛṣṇa. This is pleasing to Lord Kṛṣṇa. Śrīla Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura confirms this philosophy: *chāḍiyā vaiṣṇava-sevā nistāra peyeche kebā.* Unless one serves a liberated Vaiṣṇava, he cannot attain liberation by directly serving Kṛṣṇa. He must serve the servant of Kṛṣṇa.

व्राह्मण-सेवाय़ कृष्णेर प्रीति वड़ हय़ ।

### Verse text

*brāhmaṇa-sevāya kṛṣṇera prīti baḍa haya  
tāṅhāra santoṣe bhakti-sampad bāḍaya”*

### Synonyms

*brāhmaṇa*-*sevāya* — by rendering service to a *brāhmaṇa*; *kṛṣṇera* — of Lord Kṛṣṇa; *prīti* — the satisfaction; *baḍa* — very great; *haya* — is; *tāṅhāra* *santoṣe* — by pleasing the Lord; *bhakti* — of devotional service; *sampad* — the opulence; *bāḍaya* — increases.

### Translation

**“Lord Kṛṣṇa is very much pleased by service rendered to brāhmaṇas, and when the Lord is pleased, the opulence of one’s devotional service increases.”**

### Purport

In this regard, Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura comments that the younger *brāhmaṇa* rendered service to the older one with the purpose of pleasing Kṛṣṇa. It was not a matter of ordinary worldly dealings. Kṛṣṇa is pleased when a Vaiṣṇava is rendered service. Because the younger *brāhmaṇa* served the older one, Lord Gopāla agreed to become a witness of the marriage negotiation in order to maintain the prestige of both devotees. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu would certainly not have liked to hear about marital dealings unless such dealings were exchanged between two Vaiṣṇavas. Marriage arrangements and ceremonies belong to ordinary material *karma-kāṇḍa* sections of the scriptures. The Vaiṣṇavas, however, are not interested in any kind of *karma-kāṇḍa* dealings. Śrīla Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura says: *karma-kāṇḍa jñāna-kāṇḍa kevala viṣera bhāṇḍa.* For a Vaiṣṇava, the *karma-kāṇḍa* and *jñāna-kāṇḍa* sections of the *Vedas* are unnecessary. Indeed, a real Vaiṣṇava takes these sections as a poison pot (*viṣera bhāṇḍa*)*.* Sometimes we take part in a marriage ceremony for our disciples, but this does not mean that we are interested in *karma-kāṇḍa* activities. Sometimes, not knowing the Vaiṣṇava philosophy, an outsider criticizes such activity, maintaining that a *sannyāsī* should not take part in a marriage ceremony between a young boy and a young girl. However, this is not a *karma-kāṇḍa* activity, because our purpose is to spread the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. We are giving all facility to the general populace to take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and in order to fix the devotees in concentration on the service of the Lord, marriage is sometimes allowed. We have experienced that such married couples actually render very important service to the mission. Therefore, one should not misunderstand when a *sannyāsī* takes part in a marriage ceremony. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and Nityānanda Prabhu took great pleasure in hearing about the marriage ceremony between the young *brāhmaṇa* and the daughter of the elderly *brāhmaṇa.*

*bandhūnām icchatāṁ dātuṁ* *kṛṣṇāya bhaginīṁ nṛpa  
tato nivārya kṛṣṇa-dviḍ* *rukmī caidyam amanyata*

King Bhīṣmaka of Vidarbha wanted to offer Kṛṣṇa his daughter, Rukmiṇī, but Rukmī, the eldest of his five sons, objected. Therefore Bhīṣmaka withdrew his decision and decided to offer Rukmiṇī to the King of Cedi, Śiśupāla, who was a cousin of Kṛṣṇa’s. However, Rukmiṇī conceived of a trick: she sent a letter to Kṛṣṇa asking Him to kidnap her. Thus in order to please Rukmiṇī, who was His great devotee, Kṛṣṇa kidnapped her. There ensued a great fight between Kṛṣṇa and the opposing party, headed by Rukmiṇī’s brother Rukmī. Rukmī was defeated and, because of his harsh words against Kṛṣṇa, was about to be killed, but he was saved at the request of Rukmiṇī. However, Kṛṣṇa shaved off all of Rukmī’s hair with His sword. Śrī Balarāma did not like this, and so to please Rukmiṇī, Balarāma rebuked Kṛṣṇa.

### Translation

**Coming before Gopāla, the elderly brāhmaṇa said, “My dear Lord, please witness that I have given my daughter to this boy.”**

### Purport

In India it is still the custom for a daughter to be offered to someone simply by word. This is called *vāg-datta.* This means that the father, brother or guardian of a girl has given his word that she will be married to a certain man. Consequently, that daughter cannot be married to anyone else. She is reserved by virtue of the honest words of the father or guardian. There are many instances in which the parents of a female child have given someone a verbal promise that their daughter will be married to his son. Both parties agree to wait until the boy and girl are grown up, and then the marriage takes place. Following this custom, which is very old in India, the elderly *brāhmaṇa* promised to give his daughter to the younger *brāhmaṇa* in charity, and he promised this before the Gopāla Deity. In India the custom is to honor any promise made before the Deity. Such a promise cannot be canceled. In Indian villages, whenever there is a quarrel between two parties, they go to a temple to settle the quarrel. Whatever is spoken in front of the Deity is taken to be true, for no one would dare lie before the Deity. This same principle was followed in the Battle of Kurukṣetra. Therefore in the very beginning of the *Bhagavad-gītā* it is stated: *dharma-kṣetre kuru-kṣetre.*

By not becoming God conscious, human society is deteriorating to the lowest standard of animal life. This Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is very essential to reviving God consciousness among the general populace. If people actually become God conscious, all quarrels can be settled outside of court, as happened in the case of the two *brāhmaṇas* whose disagreement was settled by the witness Gopāla.

### Purport

The son of the elderly *brāhmaṇa* was an atheist and a follower of the *Raghunātha-smṛti.* He was very expert in dealing with pounds-shillings-pence, but he was fool number one. Consequently, he did not believe in the spiritual position of the Deity, nor did he have any faith in the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore, as a typical idol worshiper, he considered the form of the Lord to be made of stone or wood. Thus he assured his father that the witness was only a stone Deity and was not capable of speaking. Besides that, he assured his father that the Deity was situated far away and consequently could not come to bear witness. In essence, he was saying, “Have no anxiety. You do not have to lie directly, but you should speak like a diplomat, like King Yudhiṣṭhira when he spoke to Droṇācārya — *aśvatthāmā hata iti gajaḥ.* Following this principle, simply say that you do not remember anything and are completely unaware of the statements given by the young *brāhmaṇa.* If you make the background like that, I shall know how to fill in the argument and defeat him by word jugglery. Thus I shall save you from having to give your daughter to him. In this way, our aristocracy will be saved. You have nothing to worry about.”

### Translation

**“Thus I have called upon a great personality in this transaction. I have asked the Supreme Godhead to be my witness. The entire world accepts the words of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.”**

### Purport

Although the young *brāhmaṇa* described himself as having no claims to aristocracy and being an uneducated common man, still he had one good qualification: he believed that the Supreme Personality of Godhead was the topmost authority, he accepted the words of Lord Kṛṣṇa without hesitation, and he had firm faith in the Lord’s consistency. According to Prahlāda Mahārāja, another authority on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, such a staunch and faithful devotee of the Lord must be understood to be a most learned scholar: *tan manye ’dhītam uttamam* (*Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* 7.5.24). A pure devotee who has firm faith in the words of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is to be considered a most learned scholar, the topmost aristocrat and the richest man in the whole world. All godly qualities automatically exist in such a devotee. In the preaching work of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, we, as the servant of the servant of the servant of the servant of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, fully believe in the words of Kṛṣṇa and His servants, the disciplic succession. In this way we are presenting the words of Kṛṣṇa throughout the world. Even though we are neither a rich man nor a very learned scholar, and even though we do not belong to any aristocracy, this movement is still being welcomed and is very easily spreading all over the world. Although we are very poor and have no professional source of income, Kṛṣṇa supplies money whenever we need it. Whenever we need some men, Kṛṣṇa supplies them. Thus it is stated in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (6.22): *yaṁ labdhvā cāparaṁ lābhaṁ manyate nādhikaṁ tataḥ.* Actually, if we can attain the favor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, we do not need anything else. We certainly do not need those things which a mundane person considers to be material assets.

### Translation

**Taking this opportunity, the elderly brāhmaṇa immediately confirmed that this was really true. He said, “If Gopāla personally comes here to serve as a witness, I shall surely give my daughter to the young brāhmaṇa.”**

### Purport

**The elderly brāhmaṇa’s son immediately confirmed this, saying, “Yes, this is a very nice settlement.”**

As the Supersoul within the heart of all living entities, Kṛṣṇa knows everyone’s desire, everyone’s request and everyone’s prayer. Although all these may be contradictory, the Lord has to create a situation in which everyone will be pleased. This is an instance of a marriage negotiation between an elderly *brāhmaṇa* and a youthful one. The elderly *brāhmaṇa* was certainly willing to give his daughter in charity to the young *brāhmaṇa,* but his son and relatives became impediments to this transaction. The elderly *brāhmaṇa* considered how to get out of this situation and still offer his daughter to the young *brāhmaṇa.* His son, an atheist and a very cunning fellow, was thinking of how to stop the marriage. The father and son were thinking in a contradictory way, yet Kṛṣṇa created a situation wherein they agreed. They both agreed that if the Gopāla Deity would come and serve as a witness, the daughter would be given to the young *brāhmaṇa.*

### Purport

It was not at all the intention of the young *brāhmaṇa* to get the daughter of the elderly *brāhmaṇa* in marriage and thus enjoy material happiness and sense gratification. It was not for that reason that the young *brāhmaṇa* went to Vṛndāvana to ask the Supreme Personality of Godhead to act as a witness. His only concern was that the elderly *brāhmaṇa* had promised something, and if Gopāla did not bear witness to that transaction, then the older *brāhmaṇa* would incur a spiritual blemish. Therefore, the young *brāhmaṇa* wanted protection and help from the Deity. The young *brāhmaṇa* was thus a pure Vaiṣṇava, and he had no desire for sense gratification. He wanted only to serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the older *brāhmaṇa,* who was also a Vaiṣṇava and very much devoted to the Lord.

### Purport

The dealings between a devotee and the Lord are very simple. The young *brāhmaṇa* said to the Lord, “You know everything, but if You do not bear witness, You will be involved in sinful activities.” There is no possibility, however, of the Lord’s being involved in sinful activities. A pure devotee, even though he knows everything of the Supreme Lord, can speak with the Lord exactly as if He were a common man. Although the dealings between the Lord and His devotee are always very simple and open, there is formality. All these things happen because of the connection between the Lord and the devotee.

### Translation

**Śrī Gopālajī then smiled and said, “My dear brāhmaṇa, just listen to Me. I shall walk behind you, and in this way I shall go with you.”**

### Purport

The conversation between Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa and the *brāhmaṇa* is proof that the Lord in His *arcā-mūrti,* or form made of material elements, is not material, for those elements, although separated from the Lord, are also a part of the Lord’s energy, as stated in the *Bhagavad-gītā.* Because the elements are the Lord’s own energy and because there is no difference between the energy and the energetic, the Lord can appear through any element. Just as the sun can act through the sunshine and thus distribute its heat and light, so Kṛṣṇa, by His inconceivable power, can appear in His original spiritual form in any material element, including stone, wood, paint, gold, silver and jewels, because the material elements are all His energy. The *śāstras* warn, *arcye viṣṇau śilā-dhīḥ . . . nārakī saḥ:* one should never think of the *arcā-mūrti,* the Deity within the temple, as stone, wood or any other material element. Because of his advanced devotional position, the younger *brāhmaṇa* knew that although the Deity of Gopāla appeared to be stone, He was not stone. He was the son of Nanda Mahārāja, Vrajendra-nandana Himself. As such, the Deity could act exactly as the Lord does in His original form as Kṛṣṇa.

Lord Kṛṣṇa was talking to the young *brāhmaṇa* just to test his knowledge about the *arcā-vigraha.* In other words, those who have understood the science of Kṛṣṇa — Kṛṣṇa’s name, form, qualities and so forth — can also talk with the Deity. To an ordinary person, however, the Deity will appear to be made of stone, wood or some other material. In the higher sense, since all material elements ultimately emanate from the supreme spiritual entity, nothing is really material. Being omnipotent, omnipresent and omniscient, Kṛṣṇa can deal with His devotee in any form without difficulty. By the mercy of the Lord, the devotee knows perfectly well about the Lord’s dealings. Indeed, he can talk face to face with the Lord.

### Translation

**After the marriage ceremony was performed, the Lord informed both brāhmaṇas, “You two brāhmaṇas are My eternal servants, birth after birth.”**

### Purport

Like these two *brāhmaṇas* of Vidyānagara, there are many devotees who are eternal servants of the Lord. They are specifically known as *nitya-siddha,* eternally perfect. Although the *nitya-siddhas* appear in the material world and seem to be common members of the world, they never forget the Supreme Personality of Godhead in any condition. This is the symptom of a *nitya-siddha.*

There are two kinds of living entities — *nitya-siddha* and *nitya-baddha.* The *nitya-siddha* never forgets his relationship with the Supreme Personality, whereas the *nitya-baddha* is always conditioned, even before the creation. He always forgets his relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Here the Lord informs the two *brāhmaṇas* that they are His servants birth after birth. The phrase birth after birth refers to the material world because in the spiritual world there is no birth, death, old age or disease. By the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the *nitya-siddha* remains within this material world like an ordinary man, but the only business of the *nitya-siddha* is to broadcast the glories of the Lord. This incident appears to be an ordinary story about a marriage transaction involving two ordinary people. However, Kṛṣṇa accepted the two *brāhmaṇas* as His eternal servants. Both *brāhmaṇas* took much trouble in these negotiations, just like mundane people, yet they were acting as eternal servants of the Lord. All *nitya-siddhas* within this material world may appear to toil like ordinary men, but they never forget their position as servants of the Lord.

Another point: The elderly *brāhmaṇa* belonged to an aristocratic family and was learned and wealthy. The young *brāhmaṇa* belonged to an ordinary family and was uneducated. But these mundane qualifications do not concern a *nitya-siddha* engaged in the service of the Lord. We have to accept the fact that the *nitya-siddhas* are completely distinct from the *nitya-baddhas,* who are ordinary human beings. Śrīla Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura confirms this statement:

*gaurāṅgera saṅgi-gaṇe,* *nitya-siddha kari’ māne,  
se yāya vrajendra-suta pāśa  
śrī-gauḍa-maṇḍala-bhūmi,* *yebā jāne cintāmaṇi  
tāra haya vraja-bhūme vāsa*

One who accepts the associates of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu as *nitya-siddhas* is certain to be elevated to the spiritual kingdom to become an associate of the Supreme Lord. One should also know that Gauḍa-maṇḍala-bhūmi — those places in Bengal where Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu stayed — are equal to Vrajabhūmi, or Vṛndāvana. There is no difference between the inhabitants of Vṛndāvana and those of Gauḍa-maṇḍala-bhūmi, or Śrīdhāma Māyāpur.

This city of Vidyānagara is situated in Trailaṅga-deśa, South India, on the bank of the river Godāvarī. The place where the Godāvarī flows into the Bay of Bengal is called Koṭadeśa. The Orissa kingdom was very powerful, and Koṭadeśa was the capital of Orissa. It was then known as Vidyānagara. Formerly this city was situated on the southern side of the river Godāvarī. At that time King Puruṣottama-deva managed to control Orissa and appoint a government. The present city of Vidyānagara is on the southeast side of the river, only twenty to twenty-five miles from Rajahmundry. During the time of Mahārāja Pratāparudra, Śrī Rāmānanda Rāya was the governor there. Vijaya-nagara is not identical with Vidyānagara.

### Translation

**\[In his book Caitanya-bhāgavata\] Śrīla Vṛndāvana dāsa Ṭhākura has very vividly described the places visited by the Lord on the way to Bhuvaneśvara.**

### Purport

In his book *Caitanya-bhāgavata, Antya-khaṇḍa,* Śrīla Vṛndāvana dāsa Ṭhākura has very nicely described the Lord’s journey en route to Kaṭaka (Cuttack). On that journey, the Lord visited a place known as Bālihastā, or Bālakāṭīcaṭi. He then visited the city of Bhuvaneśvara, where Lord Śiva’s temple is located. The temple of Bhuvaneśvara is situated about five to six miles from Bālakāṭīcaṭi. The temple of Lord Śiva is mentioned in the *Skanda Purāṇa,* in the narration about the Lord’s garden and the one mango tree. A king named Kāśirāja wanted to fight with Lord Kṛṣṇa, and consequently he took shelter of Lord Śiva to acquire the power to fight the Lord. Being pleased with his worship, Lord Śiva helped him fight Kṛṣṇa. Lord Śiva’s name is Āśutoṣa, which indicates that he is very easily satisfied when one worships him, regardless of the purpose, and he gives his devotee whatever benediction the devotee wants. Therefore, people are generally very fond of worshiping Lord Śiva. Thus Kāśirāja was helped by Lord Śiva, but in the fight with Lord Kṛṣṇa he was not only defeated but killed. In this way the weapon known as Pāśupata-astra was baffled, and Kṛṣṇa set fire to the city of Kāśī. Later Lord Śiva became conscious of his mistake in helping Kāśirāja, and he begged Lord Kṛṣṇa’s forgiveness. As a benediction from Lord Kṛṣṇa, he received a place known as Ekāmra-kānana. Later, the kings of the Keśarī dynasty established their capital there, and for many hundreds of years they reigned over the state of Orissa.

### Translation

### Purport

In the *Caitanya-bhāgavata* (*Antya-khaṇḍa,* chapter two) it is said that when Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu arrived at Śrī Bhuvaneśvara, He visited the temple of Lord Śiva known as Gupta-kāśī (the concealed Vārāṇasī). Lord Śiva established this as a place of pilgrimage by bringing water from all holy places and creating the lake known as Bindu-sarovara. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu took His bath in this lake, feeling a great regard for Lord Śiva. From the spiritual point of view, people still go to take a bath in this lake. Actually, by taking a bath there, one becomes very healthy even from the material viewpoint. Taking a bath and drinking the water of this lake can cure any disease of the stomach. Regular bathing certainly cures indigestion. The river Bhārgī, or Bhārgīnadī, came to be known as the Daṇḍa-bhāṅgā-nadī after Lord Caitanya bathed in its waters. It is situated six miles north of Jagannātha Purī. The reason for the change in names is given as follows.

### Translation

**When Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu went to the temple of Lord Śiva known as Kapoteśvara, Nityānanda Prabhu, who was keeping His sannyāsa staff in custody, broke the staff in three parts and threw it into the river Bhārgīnadī. Later this river became known as Daṇḍa-bhāṅgā-nadī.**

### Purport

The mystery of the *sannyāsa-daṇḍa* (staff) of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu has been explained by Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu accepted the order of *sannyāsa* from a Māyāvādī *sannyāsī.* The Māyāvādī *sannyāsīs* generally carry one staff, or *daṇḍa.* Taking advantage of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s absence, Śrīla Nityānanda Prabhu broke the staff into three parts and threw it into the river later known as the Daṇḍa-bhāṅgā-nadī. In the *sannyāsa* order there are four divisions — *kuṭīcaka, bahūdaka, haṁsa* and *paramahaṁsa.* Only when the *sannyāsī* remains on the *kuṭīcaka* and *bahūdaka* platforms can he carry a staff. However, when one is elevated to the status of *haṁsa* or *paramahaṁsa,* after touring and preaching the *bhakti* cult, he must give up the *sannyāsa* staff.

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is therefore said, *śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya, rādhā-kṛṣṇa nahe anya:* “Two personalities — Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī and Śrī Kṛṣṇa — are combined in the incarnation of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.” Therefore, considering Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu to be an extraordinary person, Lord Nityānanda Prabhu did not wait for the *paramahaṁsa* stage. He reasoned that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is automatically on the *paramahaṁsa* stage; therefore He does not need to carry the *sannyāsa-daṇḍa.* This is the reason Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu broke the staff into three pieces and threw it into the water.

Historians say this temple must have been constructed at least two thousand years ago. During the time of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, the small buildings surrounding the original temple had not been constructed. Nor was the high platform in front of the temple present during the time of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

### Translation

### Purport

Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu considered Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s acceptance of *sannyāsa* to be useless. He therefore relieved the Lord of the trouble of carrying the staff. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu expressed anger because He wanted to teach all other *sannyāsīs* that they should not give up the staff before attaining the platform of *paramahaṁsa.* Seeing that the regulative principles could be slackened by such action, Caitanya Mahāprabhu wanted to carry the staff personally. However, Nityānanda broke it. For this reason Caitanya Mahāprabhu displayed a little anger. It is said in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (3.21), *yad yad ācarati śreṣṭhas tat tad evetaro janaḥ:* Whatever great people do, others follow. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu wanted to follow the Vedic principles strictly in order to save inexperienced neophytes who try to imitate *paramahaṁsas.*

### Translation

**The pastime of the breaking of the staff is very deep. Only one whose devotion is fixed upon the lotus feet of the two Lords can understand it.**

### Purport

One who understands Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and Nityānanda Prabhu in reality can understand Their identity as well as the breaking of the staff. All the previous *ācāryas,* being induced to engage themselves fully in the service of the Lord, gave up attachment for material life and thus accepted the staff, which signifies full engagement of the mind, speech and body in the service of the Lord. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu accepted the regulative principles of the renounced order of life. That is completely clear. However, in the *paramahaṁsa* stage there is no need to accept a *daṇḍa* (staff), and Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was certainly in the *paramahaṁsa* stage. Nonetheless, to indicate that everyone should take *sannyāsa* at the end of life in order to engage fully in the service of the Lord, even *paramahaṁsas* like Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and His confidential devotees follow the regulative principles unfailingly. Indeed, that was His purpose. Nityānanda Prabhu, who was His eternal servitor, believed that there was no need for Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu to carry the staff, and to declare to the world that Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was above all regulations, He broke it into three pieces. The pastime known as *daṇḍa-bhaṅga-līlā* is thus explained by Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura.

### Translation

**The glories of Lord Gopāla, who is merciful to brāhmaṇas, are very great. The narration of Sākṣi-gopāla was spoken by Nityānanda Prabhu and heard by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.**

### Purport

There are four points of instruction one should consider in the story of Sākṣi-gopāla. First, the Deity (*arcā-vigraha*) of Śrī Gopāla is eternally *sac-cid-ānanda-vigraha,* the transcendental form of the Lord. Second, the Deity surpasses material regulative principles and extends the reality of transcendental principles. Third, one can be situated in a transcendental position after becoming a *brāhmaṇa,* but as a *brāhmaṇa,* one has to follow the regulative principles very strictly. Lastly, *brahmaṇya-deva* indicates Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa Himself, who is worshiped thus: *namo brahmaṇya-devāya go-brāhmaṇa-hitāya ca/ jagad-dhitāya kṛṣṇāya govindāya namo namaḥ.* This indicates that a devotee who is under the protection of Kṛṣṇa is automatically situated as a *brāhmaṇa,* and such a *brāhmaṇa* is not illusioned. This is factual.
