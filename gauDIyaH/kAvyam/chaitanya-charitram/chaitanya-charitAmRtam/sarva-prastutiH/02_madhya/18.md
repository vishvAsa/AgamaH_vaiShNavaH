CHAPTER EIGHTEEN

The following summary of the eighteenth chapter is given by Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura in his *Amṛta-pravāha-bhāṣya.* In the village of Āriṭ-grāma, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu discovered the transcendental lakes known as Rādhā-kuṇḍa and Śyāma-kuṇḍa. He then saw the Deity Harideva at Govardhana Village. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu had no desire to climb Govardhana Hill because the hill is worshiped as Kṛṣṇa. The Gopāla Deity could understand the mind of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu; therefore on the plea of being attacked by Muslims, Gopāla transferred Himself to the village of Gāṅṭhuli-grāma. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu then went to Gāṅṭhuli-grāma to see Lord Gopāla. Some years later, Lord Gopāla also went to Mathurā, to the house of Viṭhṭhaleśvara, and stayed there for one month just to give an audience to Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī.

After visiting Nandīśvara, Pāvana-sarovara, Śeṣaśāyī, Khelā-tīrtha, Bhāṇḍīravana, Bhadravana, Lohavana and Mahāvana, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu went to Gokula and then finally returned to Mathurā. Seeing a great crowd in Mathurā, He moved His residence near Akrūra-ghāṭa, and from there He went every day to Vṛndāvana to see Kālīya-hrada, Dvādaśāditya-ghāṭa, Keśī-ghāṭa, Rāsa-sthalī, Cīra-ghāṭa and Āmli-talā. At Kālīya Lake, many people mistook a fisherman for Kṛṣṇa. When some respectable people came to see Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, they expressed their opinion that when one takes *sannyāsa,* he becomes Nārāyaṇa. Their mistake was corrected by the Lord. In this way, their Kṛṣṇa consciousness was awakened, and they could understand that a *sannyāsī* is simply a living entity and not the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

When Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu took His bath at Akrūra-ghāṭa, He submerged Himself in the water for a long time. Balabhadra Bhaṭṭācārya decided to take Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu to Prayāga after visiting the holy place known as Soro-kṣetra. While stopping near a village on the way to Prayāga, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu fainted in ecstatic love. Some Pāṭhāna soldiers who were passing through saw Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and falsely concluded that the Lord’s associates, Balabhadra Bhaṭṭācārya and others, had killed the Lord with a poison named *dhuturā* and were taking His wealth. Thus the soldiers arrested them. However, when Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu regained His senses, His associates were released. He talked with a person who was supposed to be a holy man in the party. From the Koran, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu established devotional service to Kṛṣṇa. Thus the leader of the soldiers, named Vijulī Khān, surrendered to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and he and his party became devotees of Lord Kṛṣṇa. The same village today is known as the village of Pāṭhāna Vaiṣṇavas. After bathing in the Ganges at Soro, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu arrived at Prayāga, at the confluence of three rivers — the Ganges, Yamunā and Sarasvatī.

### Purport

Āriṭ-grāma is also called Ariṣṭa-grāma. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu understood that in that village Ariṣṭāsura had been killed by Śrī Kṛṣṇa. While there, He inquired about Rādhā-kuṇḍa, but no one could tell Him where it was. The *brāhmaṇa* accompanying Him could also not ascertain its whereabouts. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu could then understand that the holy places known as Rādhā-kuṇḍa and Śyāma-kuṇḍa were at that time lost to everyone’s vision. He therefore discovered Rādhā-kuṇḍa and Śyāma-kuṇḍa, which were two reservoirs of water in two paddy fields. Although there was very little water, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was omniscient and could understand that formerly these two ponds were called Śrī Rādhā-kuṇḍa and Śyāma-kuṇḍa. In this way Rādhā-kuṇḍa and Śyāma-kuṇḍa were discovered.

### Purport

Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura gives the following information about Govinda-kuṇḍa. There is a village named Āniyora on Govardhana Hill, a little distance from the village of Paiṭha. Govinda-kuṇḍa is situated near here, and there are two temples to Govinda and Baladeva there. According to some, Queen Padmāvatī excavated this lake. In the *Bhakti-ratnākara* (Fifth Wave), the following statement is found:

*ei śrī-govinda-kuṇḍa-mahimā aneka  
ethā indra kaila govindera abhiṣeka*

“Govinda-kuṇḍa is exalted for its many spiritual activities. It was here that Indra, defeated by Lord Govinda, offered prayers to Him and bathed Him.” In the book *Stavāvalī* (*Vraja-vilāsa-stava* 74) the following verse is found:

*nīcaiḥ prauḍha-bhayāt svayaṁ sura-patiḥ pādau vidhṛtyeha yaiḥ *
 *svar-gaṅgā-salilaiś cakāra surabhi-dvārābhiṣekotsavam  
govindasya navaṁ gavām adhipatā rājye sphuṭaṁ kautukāt *
 *tair yat prādurabhūt sadā sphuratu tad govinda-kuṇḍaṁ dṛśoḥ*

“With humility caused by great fear, Indra took hold of the lotus feet of Lord Kṛṣṇa and, in the company of a *surabhi* cow, performed His coronation festival by bathing Him with the waters of the heavenly Ganges River. Thus Lord Kṛṣṇa’s kingship over the cows became splendidly manifest. I pray that Govinda-kuṇḍa, the lake created by that ceremonial bath, may eternally appear before my eyes.”

Also, in the *Mathurā-khaṇḍa* it is stated:

*yatrābhiṣikto bhagavān* *maghonā yadu-vairiṇā  
govinda-kuṇḍaṁ taj-jātaṁ* *snāna-mātreṇa mokṣa-dam*

“Simply by bathing in Govinda-kuṇḍa, one is awarded liberation. This lake was produced when Bhagavān Śrī Kṛṣṇa was bathed by Lord Indra.”

Gāṅṭhuli-grāma is situated near the two villages Bilachu and Gopāla-pura. According to hearsay, Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa first met here. In the *Bhakti-ratnākara* (Fifth Wave), it is stated, *sakhī duṅha vastre gāṅṭhi dila saṅgopane:* “The two concealed Themselves by tying Their outer garments together.” It is also stated, *phāguyā laiyā keha gāṅṭhi khuli’ dilā:* “With a *phāguyā* They undid the knot.” For this reason the village is known as Gāṅṭhuli.

### Purport

When the two brothers Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī and Sanātana Gosvāmī went to Vṛndāvana, they decided to live there. Following Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s example, they did not climb the hill because they considered it nondifferent from Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. On some pretext, the Gopāla Deity granted Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu an audience beneath the hill, and Gopāla similarly favored Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī and Sanātana Gosvāmī. During his ripe old age, when Rūpa Gosvāmī could not go to Govardhana Hill because of invalidity, Gopāla kindly went to Mathurā and remained at the house of Viṭhṭhaleśvara for one month. It was then that Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī could see Gopāla’s beauty to his heart’s content.

The following description concerning Viṭhṭhaleśvara is given in the *Bhakti-ratnākara* (Fifth Wave):

*viṭhṭhalera sevā kṛṣṇa-caitanya-vigraha  
tāhāra darśane haila parama āgraha*

Śrī Vallabha Bhaṭṭa had two sons. The elder, Gopīnātha, was born in 1432 Śakābda Era (A.D. 1510), and the younger, Viṭhṭhaleśvara, was born in 1437 (A.D. 1515) and died in 1507 (A.D. 1585). Viṭhṭhaleśvara had seven sons: Giridhara, Govinda, Bālakṛṣṇa, Gokuleśa, Raghunātha, Yadunātha and Ghanaśyāma. Viṭhṭhaleśvara completed many of his father’s unfinished books, including his commentary on the *Vedānta-sūtra,* the *Subodhinī* commentary on *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, Vidvan-maṇḍana, Śṛṅgāra-rasa-maṇḍana* and *Nyāsādeśa-vivaraṇa.* Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu went to Vṛndāvana before the birth of Viṭhṭhaleśvara. As previously mentioned, Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī was very old at the time Gopāla stayed at the house of Viṭhṭhaleśvara.

### Purport

Śrī Lokanātha Gosvāmī was a personal associate of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and a great devotee of the Lord. He was a resident of a village named Tālakhaḍi in the district of Yaśohara (Jessore), in Bengal. Previously he lived in Kācanāpāḍā. His father’s name was Padmanābha, and his only sibling was a younger brother named Pragalbha. Following the orders of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Śrī Lokanātha went to Vṛndāvana to live. He established a temple named Gokulānanda. Śrīla Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura selected Lokanātha dāsa Gosvāmī to be his spiritual master, and Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura was his only disciple. Because Lokanātha dāsa Gosvāmī did not want his name mentioned in the *Caitanya-caritāmṛta,* we do not often see it in this celebrated book. On the E.B.R. Railroad, the Yaśohara station is located in Bangladesh. From the railway station one has to go by bus to the village of Sonākhāli and from there to Khejurā. From there one has to walk or, during the rainy season, go by boat to the village of Tālakhaḍi. In this village there are still descendants of Lokanātha Gosvāmī’s younger brother.

### Verse text

*bhaṭṭācārya tabe kahe prabhura caraṇe  
‘ājñā deha’, yāi’ kari kṛṣṇa daraśane!’*

### Synonyms

*bhaṭṭācārya* — Balabhadra Bhaṭṭācārya; *tabe* — at that time; *kahe* — says; *prabhura* *caraṇe* — at the lotus feet of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu; *ājñā* *deha’* — please give permission; *yāi’* — going; *kari* *kṛṣṇa* *daraśane* — I shall see Lord Kṛṣṇa directly.

### Translation

**At that time Balabhadra Bhaṭṭācārya placed a request at the lotus feet of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. He said, “Please give me permission to go see Lord Kṛṣṇa directly.”**

### Purport

The puzzled people who visited Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu were actually seeing Lord Kṛṣṇa, but they were mistaken in thinking that Lord Kṛṣṇa had come to Kālīya Lake. They all said that they had seen Kṛṣṇa directly performing His pastimes on the hoods of the serpent Kālīya and that the jewels on Kālīya’s hoods were blazing brilliantly. Because they were speculating with their imperfect knowledge, they saw Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu as an ordinary human being and a boatman’s light in the lake as Kṛṣṇa. One must see things as they are through the mercy of a spiritual master; otherwise, if one tries to see Kṛṣṇa directly, he may mistake an ordinary man for Kṛṣṇa or Kṛṣṇa for an ordinary man. Everyone has to see Kṛṣṇa according to the verdict of Vedic literatures presented by the self-realized spiritual master. A sincere person is able to see Kṛṣṇa through the transparent via medium of Śrī Gurudeva, the spiritual master. Unless one is enlightened by the knowledge given by the spiritual master, he cannot see things as they are, even though he remains constantly with the spiritual master. This incident at Kālīya-daha is very instructive for those eager to advance in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

### Verse text

*tabe tāṅre kahe prabhu cāpaḍa māriyā  
“mūrkhera vākye ‘mūrkha’ hailā paṇḍita hañā*

### Synonyms

*tabe* — thereafter; *tāṅre* — unto Balabhadra Bhaṭṭācārya; *kahe* — says; *prabhu* — Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu; *cāpaḍa* *māriyā* — slapping; *mūrkhera* *vākye* — by the words of some rascals and fools; *mūrkha* *hailā* — you became a fool; *paṇḍita* *hañā* — being a learned scholar.

### Translation

**When Balabhadra Bhaṭṭācārya asked to see Kṛṣṇa at Kālīya-daha, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu mercifully slapped him, saying, “You are a learned scholar, but you have become a fool, being influenced by the statements of other fools.**

### Purport

*Māyā* is so strong that even a person like Balabhadra Bhaṭṭācārya, who was constantly staying with Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, was influenced by the words of fools. He wanted to see Kṛṣṇa directly by going to Kālīya-daha, but Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, being the original spiritual master, would not allow His servant to fall into such foolishness. He therefore chastised him, slapping him just to bring him to a real sense of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

### Verse text

*kṛṣṇa kene daraśana dibe kali-kāle?  
nija-bhrame mūrkha-loka kare kolāhale*

### Synonyms

*kṛṣṇa* — Lord Kṛṣṇa; *kene* — why; *daraśana* — interview; *dibe* — would give; *kali*-*kāle* — in this Age of Kali; *nija*-*bhrame* — by their own mistake; *mūrkha*-*loka* — foolish persons; *kare* *kolāhale* — make a chaotic tumult.

### Translation

**“Why would Kṛṣṇa appear in the Age of Kali? Foolish people who are mistaken are simply causing agitation and making a tumult.**

### Purport

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s first statement (*kṛṣṇa kene daraśana dibe kali-kāle*) refers to the scriptures. According to scripture, Kṛṣṇa appears in Dvāpara-yuga, but He never appears as Himself in Kali-yuga. Rather, He appears in Kali-yuga in a covered form. As stated in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (11.5.32), *kṛṣṇa-varṇaṁ tviṣākṛṣṇaṁ sāṅgopāṅgāstra-pārṣadam.* Kṛṣṇa appears in the Age of Kali in the garb of a devotee, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, who always associates with His internal soldiers — Śrī Advaita Prabhu, Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu, Śrīvāsa Prabhu and Gadādhara Prabhu. Although Balabhadra Bhaṭṭācārya was personally serving Lord Kṛṣṇa in His role as a devotee (Caitanya Mahāprabhu), he mistook Lord Kṛṣṇa for an ordinary man and an ordinary man for Lord Kṛṣṇa because he did not follow the rules set down by *śāstra* and *guru.*

*kintu* — but; *kāhoṅ* — where; *kṛṣṇa* — Kṛṣṇa; *dekhe* — one sees; *kāhoṅ* — where; *bhrama* *māne* — mistakes; *sthāṇu*-*puruṣe* — the dry tree and a person; *yaiche* — as; *viparīta*-*jñāne* — by understanding one to be the other.

### Purport

The word *sthāṇu* means “a dry tree without leaves.” From a distance one may mistake such a tree for a person. This is called *sthāṇu-puruṣa.* Although Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was living in Vṛndāvana, the inhabitants considered Him an ordinary human being, and they mistook the fisherman to be Kṛṣṇa. Every human being is prone to make such mistakes. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was mistaken for an ordinary *sannyāsī,* the fisherman was mistaken for Kṛṣṇa, and the torchlight was mistaken for bright jewels on Kālīya’s hoods.

### Synonyms

*prabhu* *kahe* — Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu further inquired; *kāhāṅ* *pāilā* — where have you gotten; *kṛṣṇa* *daraśana* — sight of Kṛṣṇa; *loka* *kahe* — the respectable persons replied; *sannyāsī* *tumi* — You are a *sannyāsī*; *jaṅgama*-*nārāyaṇa* — moving Nārāyaṇa.

### Translation

**Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu then asked them, “Where have you seen Kṛṣṇa directly?”**

### Purport

**The people replied, “You are a sannyāsī, a renunciant; therefore You are a moving Nārāyaṇa \[jaṅgama-nārāyaṇa\].”**

This is the viewpoint of Māyāvāda philosophy. Māyāvāda philosophy supports the impersonalist view that Nārāyaṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, has no form. One can imagine impersonal Brahman in any form — as Viṣṇu, Lord Śiva, Vivasvān, Gaṇeśa or Devī Durgā. According to the Māyāvāda philosophy, when one becomes a *sannyāsī* he is to be considered a moving Nārāyaṇa. Māyāvāda philosophy holds that the real Nārāyaṇa does not move because, being impersonal, He has no legs. Thus according to Māyāvāda philosophy, whoever becomes a *sannyāsī* declares himself Nārāyaṇa. Foolish people accept such ordinary human beings as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is called *vivarta-vāda.*

In this regard, Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura comments that *jaṅgama-nārāyaṇa* means that the impersonal Brahman takes a shape and moves here and there in the form of a Māyāvādī *sannyāsī.* The Māyāvāda philosophy confirms this. *Daṇḍa-grahaṇa-mātreṇa naro nārāyaṇo bhavet:* “Simply by accepting the *daṇḍa* of the order of *sannyāsa,* one is immediately transformed into Nārāyaṇa.” Therefore Māyāvādī *sannyāsīs* address one another by saying *oṁ namo nārāyaṇāya.* In this way one Nārāyaṇa worships another Nārāyaṇa.

Actually an ordinary human being cannot become Nārāyaṇa. As the chief Māyāvādī *sannyāsī,* Śrī Śaṅkarācārya, says, *nārāyaṇaḥ paro ’vyaktāt:* “Nārāyaṇa is not a creation of this material world. Nārāyaṇa is above the material creation.” Due to their poor fund of knowledge, Māyāvādī *sannyāsīs* think that Nārāyaṇa, the Absolute Truth, takes birth as a human being and that when He realizes this, He becomes Nārāyaṇa again. They never consider why Nārāyaṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, would accept an inferior position as a human being and then again become Nārāyaṇa when He is perfect. Why should Nārāyaṇa be imperfect? Why should He appear as a human being? Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu very nicely explained these points while at Vṛndāvana.

### Purport

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu immediately stated that a living being, however exalted he may be, should never be compared to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. All of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s preaching protests the monistic philosophy of the Māyāvāda school. The central point of Kṛṣṇa consciousness is that the *jīva,* the living entity, can never be accepted as Kṛṣṇa or Viṣṇu. This viewpoint is elaborated in the following verses.

### Translation

**“A sannyāsī in the renounced order is certainly part and parcel of the complete whole, just as a shining molecular particle of sunshine is part and parcel of the sun itself. Kṛṣṇa is like the sun, full of six opulences, but the living entity is only a fragment of the complete whole.**

### Translation

**“A living entity and the Absolute Personality of Godhead are never to be considered equal, just as a fragmental spark can never be considered the original flame.**

### Purport

Māyāvādī *sannyāsīs* consider themselves Brahman, and they superficially speak of themselves as Nārāyaṇa. The monistic disciples of the Māyāvāda school (known as *smārta-brāhmaṇas*) are generally householder *brāhmaṇas* who accept the Māyāvādī *sannyāsīs* as Nārāyaṇa incarnate; therefore they offer their obeisances to them. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu immediately protested this unauthorized system, specifically mentioning that a *sannyāsī* is nothing but a fragmental portion of the Supreme (*cit-kaṇa jīva*). In other words, he is nothing more than an ordinary living being. He is never Nārāyaṇa, just as a molecular portion of sunshine is never the sun itself. The living entity is nothing but a fragmental part of the Absolute Truth; therefore at no stage of perfection can a living entity become the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This Māyāvāda viewpoint is always condemned by the Vaiṣṇava school. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu Himself protested this philosophy. When the Māyāvādīs accept *sannyāsa* and consider themselves Nārāyaṇa, they become so puffed up that they do not even enter the temple of Nārāyaṇa to offer respects, for they falsely think themselves Nārāyaṇa Himself. Although Māyāvādī *sannyāsīs* may offer respects to other *sannyāsīs* and address them as Nārāyaṇa, they do not go to a Nārāyaṇa temple and offer respects. These Māyāvādī *sannyāsīs* are always condemned and are described as demons. The *Vedas* clearly state that living entities are subordinate parts and parcels of the supreme. *Eko bahūnāṁ yo vidadhāti kāmān:* the Supreme Being, Kṛṣṇa, maintains all living entities.

### Translation

**“A foolish person who says that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the same as the living entity is an atheist, and he becomes subject to punishment by the superintendent of death, Yamarāja.**

### Purport

Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura says that the word *pāṣaṇḍī* refers to one who considers the living entity under the control of the illusory energy to be equal with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is transcendental to all material qualities. Another kind of *pāṣaṇḍī* is one who does not believe in the spirit soul, the superior potency of the Lord, and therefore does not distinguish between spirit and matter. While describing one of the offenses against chanting the holy names, specifically the offense called *śruti-śāstra-nindana* (blaspheming the Vedic literature), Jīva Gosvāmī states in his *Bhakti-sandarbha, yathā pāṣaṇda-mārgeṇa dattātreyarṣabha-devopāsakānāṁ pāṣaṇḍīnām.* “Worshipers of impersonalists like Dattātreya are also *pāṣaṇḍīs.*” Concerning the offense of *ahaṁ-mama-buddhi,* or *dehātma-buddhi* (considering the body to be the self), Jīva Gosvāmī states, *deva-draviṇādi-nimittaka-‘pāṣaṇḍa’-śabdena ca daśāparādhā eva lakṣyante, pāṣaṇḍa-mayatvāt teṣām:* “Those who are overly absorbed in the conception of the body and the bodily necessities are also called *pāṣaṇḍīs.*” Elsewhere in the *Bhakti-sandarbha* it is stated:

*uddiśya devatā eva* *juhoti ca dadāti ca  
sa pāṣaṇḍīti vijñeyaḥ* *svatantro vāpi karmasu*

“A *pāṣaṇḍī* is one who considers the demigods and the Supreme Personality of Godhead to be one; therefore a *pāṣaṇḍī* worships any kind of demigod as the Supreme Personality of Godhead.” One who disobeys the orders of the spiritual master is also considered a *pāṣaṇḍī.* The word *pāṣaṇḍī* has been described in many places in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,* including 4.2.28, 30 and 32, 5.6.9, and 12.2.13 and 3.43.

On the whole, a *pāṣaṇḍī* is a nondevotee who does not accept the Vedic conclusions. In the *Hari-bhakti-vilāsa* (1.117) there is a verse quoted from the *Padma Purāṇa* describing the *pāṣaṇḍī.* Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu quotes this verse as the following text.

### Translation

**“It is now the beginning of the month of Māgha. If we go to Prayāga at this time, we shall have an opportunity to bathe for a few days during Makara-saṅkrānti.”**

### Purport

Bathing during the month of Māgha at the Māgha-melā still takes place. This is a very old *melā* (assembly), dating from time immemorial. It is said that ever since the Lord in the form of Mohinī took a bucket of nectar and kept it at Prayāga, holy men have gathered there every year and observed the Māgha-melā. Every twelfth year there is a Kumbha-melā, a great festival, and all the holy men from all over India assemble there. The *brāhmaṇa* wanted to take advantage of the Māgha-melā and bathe there.

Bathing at the confluence of the Ganges and Yamunā, near the fort at Allahabad (Prayāga), is mentioned in the revealed scriptures:

*māghe māsi gamiṣyanti* *gaṅgā-yāmuna-saṅgamam  
gavāṁ śata-sahasrasya* *samyag dattaṁ ca yat-phalam  
prayāge māgha-māse vai* *try-ahaṁ snātasya tat-phalam*

“If one goes to Prayāga and bathes at the confluence of the Ganges and Yamunā in the month of Māgha, he attains the result of giving hundreds and thousands of cows in charity. Simply by bathing for three days there, he attains the results of such a pious activity.” Because of this, the Sanoḍiyā *brāhmaṇa* was very eager to go to Prayāga and bathe. Generally *karmīs* (fruitive laborers) take advantage of bathing there during the month of Māgha, thinking that they will be rewarded in the future. Those who are situated in devotional service do not very strictly follow this *karma-kāṇḍīya* process.

Whenever a person in the Western world becomes interested in this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, he is initiated by this process. In India we are falsely accused of converting *mlecchas* and *yavanas* to the Hindu religion. In India there are many Māyāvādī *sannyāsīs* known as *jagad-guru,* although they have hardly visited the whole world. Some are not even sufficiently educated, yet they make accusations against our movement and accuse us of destroying the principles of the Hindu religion by accepting Muslims and *yavanas* as Vaiṣṇavas. Such people are simply envious. We are not spoiling the Hindu system of religion but are simply following in the footsteps of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu by traveling all over the world and accepting those who are interested in understanding Kṛṣṇa as Kṛṣṇadāsa or Rāmadāsa. By the process of a bona fide initiation, their names are changed.
