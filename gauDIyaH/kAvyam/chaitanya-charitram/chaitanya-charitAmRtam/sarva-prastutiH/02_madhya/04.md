CHAPTER FOUR

In his *Amṛta-pravāha-bhāṣya,* Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura gives the following summary of the fourth chapter. Passing along the path of Chatrabhoga and coming to Vṛddhamantreśvara, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu reached the border of Orissa. On His way He enjoyed transcendental bliss by chanting and begging alms in different villages. In this way He reached the celebrated village of Remuṇā, where there is a Deity of Gopīnātha. There He narrated the story of Mādhavendra Purī, as He had heard it from His spiritual master, Īśvara Purī. The narration is as follows.

One night while in Govardhana, Mādhavendra Purī dreamed that the Gopāla Deity was within the forest. The next morning he invited his neighborhood friends to accompany him to excavate the Deity from the jungle. He then established the Deity of Śrī Gopālajī on top of Govardhana Hill with great pomp. Gopāla was worshiped, and the Annakūṭa festival was observed. This festival was known everywhere, and many people from the neighboring villages came to join. One night the Gopāla Deity again appeared to Mādhavendra Purī in a dream and asked him to go to Jagannātha Purī to collect some sandalwood pulp and smear it on the body of the Deity. Having received this order, Mādhavendra Purī immediately started for Orissa. Traveling through Bengal, he reached Remuṇā village and there received a pot of condensed milk (*kṣīra*) offered to the Deity of Gopīnāthajī. This pot of condensed milk was stolen by Gopīnātha and delivered to Mādhavendra Purī. Since then, the Gopīnātha Deity has been known as Kṣīra-corā-gopīnātha, the Deity who stole the pot of condensed milk. After reaching Jagannātha Purī, Mādhavendra Purī received permission from the King to take out one *maund* of sandalwood and twenty *tolas* of camphor. Aided by two men, he brought these things to Remuṇā. Again he saw in a dream that Gopāla at Govardhana Hill desired that very sandalwood to be turned into pulp mixed with camphor and smeared over the body of Gopīnāthajī. Understanding that that would satisfy the Gopāla Deity at Govardhana, Mādhavendra Purī executed the order and returned to Jagannātha Purī.

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu narrated this story for Lord Nityānanda Prabhu and other devotees and praised the pure devotional service of Mādhavendra Purī. When He recited some verses composed by Mādhavendra Purī, He went into an ecstatic mood. But when He saw that many people were assembled, He checked Himself and ate some sweet rice *prasādam.* Thus He passed that night, and the next morning He again started for Jagannātha Purī.

### Purport

Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura annotates that this Gopāla Deity was originally installed by Vajra, the great-grandson of Kṛṣṇa. Mādhavendra Purī rediscovered Gopāla and established Him on top of Govardhana Hill. This Gopāla Deity is now situated at Nāthadvāra and is under the management of descendants of Vallabhācārya. The worship of the Deity is very luxurious, and one who goes there can purchase varieties of *prasādam* by paying a small price.

*pañca*-*gavya* — in five kinds of products from the cow; *pañca*-*amṛte* — in a preparation made with five palatable foods; *snāna* — bath; *karāñā* — finishing; *mahā*-*snāna* — a vast bath with ghee and water; *karāila* — performed; *śata* — one hundred; *ghaṭa* — waterpots; *diñā* — with.

### Translation

**After the first bathing, further bathings were conducted with pañca-gavya and then with pañcāmṛta. Then the mahā-snāna was performed with ghee and water, which had been brought in one hundred pots.**

### Purport

The ingredients of *pañca-gavya* are milk, yogurt, ghee (clarified butter), cow urine and cow dung. All these items come from the cow; therefore we can just imagine how important the cow is, since its urine and stool are required for bathing the Deity. The *pañcāmṛta* consists of five kinds of nectar — yogurt, milk, ghee, honey and sugar. The major portion of this preparation also comes from the cow. To make it more palatable, sugar and honey are added.

This produces a nice finish. The oil smeared over the body of the Deity should be scented. To perform the *mahā-snāna,* at least two and a half *mānas* (about twenty-four gallons) of water are needed to pour over the body of the Deity.

### Translation

**Although Śrī Gopāla ate everything offered, still, by the touch of His transcendental hand, everything remained as before.**

### Purport

The atheists cannot understand how the Supreme Personality of Godhead, appearing in the form of the Deity, can eat all the food offered by His devotees. In the *Bhagavad-gītā* (9.26) Kṛṣṇa says:

*patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyaṁ* *yo me bhaktyā prayacchati  
tad ahaṁ bhakty-upahṛtam* *aśnāmi prayatātmanaḥ*

“If one offers Me with love and devotion a leaf, a flower, a fruit or water, I will accept it.” The Lord is *pūrṇa,* complete, and therefore He eats everything offered by His devotees. However, by the touch of His transcendental hand, all the food remains exactly as before. It is the quality that is changed. Before the food was offered, it was something else, but after it is offered the food acquires a transcendental quality. Because the Lord is *pūrṇa,* He remains the same even after eating. *Pūrṇasya pūrṇam ādāya pūrṇam evāvaśiṣyate.* The food offered to Kṛṣṇa is qualitatively as good as Kṛṣṇa; just as Kṛṣṇa is *avyaya,* indestructible, the food eaten by Kṛṣṇa, being identical with Him, remains as before.

Apart from this, Kṛṣṇa can eat the food with any one of His transcendental senses. He can eat by seeing the food or by touching it. Nor should one think that it is necessary for Kṛṣṇa to eat. He does not become hungry like an ordinary human being; nonetheless, He presents Himself as being hungry, and as such, He can eat everything and anything, regardless of quantity. The philosophy underlying Kṛṣṇa’s eating is understandable by our transcendental senses. When our senses are purified by constantly being engaged in the devotional service of the Lord, we can understand Kṛṣṇa’s activities, names, forms, qualities, pastimes and entourage.

*ataḥ śrī-kṛṣṇa-nāmādi* *na bhaved grāhyam indriyaiḥ  
sevonmukhe hi jihvādau* *svayam eva sphuraty adaḥ*

“No one can understand Kṛṣṇa by the blunt material senses. But He reveals Himself to the devotees, being pleased with them for their transcendental loving service unto Him.” (*Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu* 1.2.234) The devotees understand Kṛṣṇa through revelation. It is not possible for a mundane scholar to understand Kṛṣṇa and His pastimes through research work on the nondevotional platform.

### Translation

**The wonderful festival and installation of Śrī Gopālajī was arranged in one day. Certainly all this was accomplished by the potency of Gopāla. No one but a devotee can understand this.**

### Purport

The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement has spread all over the world within a very short time (within five years), and mundane people are very much astonished at this. However, by the grace of Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, we understand that everything is possible by the grace of Kṛṣṇa. Why does Kṛṣṇa have to take five years? In five days He can spread His name and fame all over the world like wildfire. Those who have faith in and devotion to Kṛṣṇa can understand that these things happen so wonderfully by the grace of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. We are simply the instruments. In the fierce Battle of Kurukṣetra, Arjuna was victorious within eighteen days simply because Kṛṣṇa’s grace was on his side.

*yatra yogeśvaraḥ kṛṣṇo* *yatra pārtho dhanur-dharaḥ  
tatra śrīr vijayo bhūtir* *dhruvā nītir matir mama*

“Wherever there is Kṛṣṇa, the master of all mystics, and wherever there is Arjuna, the supreme archer, there will also certainly be opulence, victory, extraordinary power and morality. That is my opinion.” (Bg. 18.78)

If the preachers in our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement are sincere devotees of Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa will always be with them because He is very kind and favorable to all His devotees. Just as Arjuna and Kṛṣṇa were victorious in the Battle of Kurukṣetra, this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement will surely emerge victorious if we but remain sincere devotees of the Lord and serve the Lord according to the advice of the predecessors (the six Gosvāmīs and other devotees of the Lord). As Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura has stated: *tāṅdera caraṇa sevi bhakta-sane vāsa, janame janame haya ei abhilāṣa.* The Kṛṣṇa consciousness devotees must always desire to remain in the society of devotees. *Bhakta-sane vāsa:* they cannot go outside the Kṛṣṇa consciousness society or movement. Within the society we must try to serve the predecessors by preaching Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s cult and spreading His name and fame all over the world. If we attempt this seriously within the society, it will be successfully done. There is no question of estimating how this will happen in the mundane sense. But without a doubt, it happens by the grace of Kṛṣṇa.

At that time Kṛṣṇa expanded Himself and declared, “I am Govardhana Hill.” In this way He accepted all the paraphernalia and food offered to Govardhana Hill. It is stated in the *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (10.24.26, 31-33):

*pacyantāṁ vividhāḥ pākāḥ* *sūpāntāḥ pāyasādayaḥ  
saṁyāvā-pūpa-śaṣkulyaḥ* *sarva-dohaś ca gṛhyatām*

*kālātmanā bhagavatā* *śakra-darpaṁ jighāṁsatā  
proktaṁ niśamya nandādyāḥ* *sādhv agṛhṇanta tad-vacaḥ*

*tathā ca vyadadhuḥ sarvaṁ* *yathāha madhusūdanaḥ  
vācayitvā svasty-ayanaṁ* *tad-dravyeṇa giri-dvijān*

*upahṛtya balīn sarvān* *ādṛtā yavasaṁ gavām  
go-dhanāni puras-kṛtya* *giriṁ cakruḥ pradakṣiṇam*

“ ‘Prepare very nice foods of all descriptions from the grains and ghee collected for the *yajña.* Prepare rice, dhal, then halavah, *pakorā, purī* and all kinds of milk preparations like sweet rice, sweetballs, *sandeśa, rasagullā* and *lāḍḍu.*’

“The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, therefore advised the cowherd men to stop the Indra-yajña and begin the Govardhana-pūjā to chastise Indra, who was very much puffed up at being the supreme controller of the heavenly planets. The honest and simple cowherd men, headed by Nanda Mahārāja, accepted Kṛṣṇa’s proposal and executed in detail everything He advised. They performed Govardhana worship and circumambulation of the hill. According to the instruction of Lord Kṛṣṇa, Nanda Mahārāja and the cowherd men called in learned *brāhmaṇas* and began to worship Govardhana Hill by chanting Vedic hymns and offering *prasādam.* The inhabitants of Vṛndāvana assembled together, decorated their cows and gave them grass. Keeping the cows in front, they began to circumambulate Govardhana Hill.”

सकल व्राह्मणे पुरी वैष्णव करिल ।  
सेइ सेइ सेवा-मध्ये सवा निय़ोजिल ॥ ८७ ॥

### Verse text

*sakala brāhmaṇe purī vaiṣṇava karila  
sei sei sevā-madhye sabā niyojila*

### Synonyms

*sakala* *brāhmaṇe* — all the *brāhmaṇas* who were present there; *purī* — Mādhavendra Purī Gosvāmī; *vaiṣṇava* *karila* — elevated to the position of Vaiṣṇavas; *sei* *sei* — under different divisions; *sevā*-*madhye* — in rendering service; *sabā* — all of them; *niyojila* — were engaged.

### Translation

**All the brāhmaṇas present on that occasion were initiated by Mādhavendra Purī into the Vaiṣṇava cult, and Mādhavendra Purī engaged them in different types of service.**

### Purport

In the scriptures it is stated, *ṣaṭ-karma-nipuṇo vipro mantra-tantra-viśāradaḥ.* A qualified *brāhmaṇa* must be expert in the occupational duties of a *brāhmaṇa.* His duties are mentioned as six brahminical engagements. *Paṭhana* means that a *brāhmaṇa* must be conversant with the Vedic scriptures. He must also be able to teach others to study the Vedic literatures. This is *pāṭhana.* He must also be expert in worshiping different deities and in performing the Vedic rituals (*yajana*)*.* On account of this *yajana,* the *brāhmaṇa,* being the head of society, performs all the Vedic rituals for *kṣatriyas, vaiśyas* and *śūdras.* This is called *yājana,* assisting others in performing ceremonies. The remaining two items are *dāna* and *pratigraha.* The *brāhmaṇa* accepts all kinds of contributions (*pratigraha*) from his followers (namely, the *kṣatriyas, vaiśyas* and *śūdras*)*.* But he does not keep all the money. He keeps only as much as required and gives the balance to others in charity (*dāna*).

In order for such a qualified *brāhmaṇa* to worship the Deity, he must be a Vaiṣṇava. Thus the Vaiṣṇava’s position is superior to that of the *brāhmaṇa.* This example given by Mādhavendra Purī confirms that even though a *brāhmaṇa* may be very expert, he cannot become a priest or servitor of the *viṣṇu-mūrti* unless he is initiated in *vaiṣṇava-mantra.* After installing the Deity of Gopāla, Mādhavendra Purī initiated all the *brāhmaṇas* into Vaiṣṇavism. He then allotted the *brāhmaṇas* different types of service to the Deity. From four in the morning until ten at night (from *maṅgala-ārātrika* to *śayana-ārātrika*), there must be at least five or six *brāhmaṇas* to take care of the Deity. Six *ārātrikas* are performed in the temple, and food is frequently offered to the Deity and the *prasādam* distributed. This is the method of worshiping the Deity according to the rules and regulations set by the predecessors. Our *sampradāya* belongs to the disciplic succession of Mādhavendra Purī, who belonged to the Madhva-sampradāya. We are in the disciplic succession of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, who was initiated by Śrī Īśvara Purī, a disciple of Mādhavendra Purī’s. Our *sampradāya* is therefore called the Madhva-Gauḍīya-sampradāya. As such, we must carefully follow in the footsteps of Śrī Mādhavendra Purī and observe how he installed the Gopāla Deity on top of Govardhana Hill, how he arranged and performed the Annakūṭa ceremony in only one day, and so forth. Our installation of Deities in America and in the wealthy countries of Europe should be carried out in terms of Śrī Mādhavendra Purī’s activities. All the servitors of the Deity must be strictly qualified as *brāhmaṇas* and, specifically, must engage in the Vaiṣṇava custom of offering as much *prasādam* as possible and distributing it to the devotees who visit the temple to see the Lord.

### Translation

**The inhabitants of the village brought to the Deity of Gopāla as much food grains, ghee, yogurt and milk as they had in their village.**

### Purport

*Anna, ghṛta, dadhi* and *dugdha* are food grains, ghee, yogurt and milk. Actually these are the basis of all food. Vegetables and fruits are subsidiary. Hundreds and thousands of preparations can be made out of grains, vegetables, ghee, milk and yogurt. The food offered to Gopāla in the Annakūṭa ceremony contained only these five ingredients. Only demoniac people are attracted to other types of food, which we will not even mention in this connection. We should understand that in order to prepare nutritious food, we require only grains, ghee, yogurt and milk. We cannot offer anything else to the Deity. The Vaiṣṇava, the perfect human being, does not accept anything not offered to the Deity. People are often frustrated with national food policies, but from the Vedic scriptures we find that if there are sufficient cows and grains, the entire food problem is solved. The *vaiśyas* (people engaged in agriculture and commerce) are therefore recommended in the *Bhagavad-gītā* to produce grains and give protection to cows. Cows are the most important animal because they produce the miracle food, milk, from which we can prepare ghee and yogurt.

The perfection of human civilization depends on Kṛṣṇa consciousness, which recommends Deity worship. Preparations made from vegetables, grains, milk, ghee and yogurt are offered to the Deity and then distributed. Here we can see the difference between the East and the West. The people who came to see the Deity of Gopāla brought all kinds of food to offer the Deity. They brought all the food they had in stock, and they came before the Deity not only to accept *prasādam* for themselves but to distribute it to others. The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement vigorously approves this practice of preparing food, offering it to the Deity and distributing it to the general population. This activity should be extended universally to stop sinful eating habits as well as other behavior befitting only demons. A demoniac civilization will never bring peace within the world. Since eating is the first necessity in human society, those engaged in solving the problems of preparing and distributing food should take lessons from Mādhavendra Purī and execute the Annakūṭa ceremony. When the people take to eating only *prasādam* offered to the Deity, all the demons will be turned into Vaiṣṇavas. When the people are Kṛṣṇa conscious, naturally the government will be so also. A Kṛṣṇa conscious man is always a very liberal well-wisher of everyone. When such men head the government, the people will certainly be sinless. They will no longer be disturbing demons. It is then and then only that a peaceful condition can prevail in society.

### Translation

**The ideal place to execute Kṛṣṇa consciousness is Vrajabhūmi, or Vṛndāvana, where the people are naturally inclined to love Kṛṣṇa and Kṛṣṇa is naturally inclined to love them.**

### Purport

In the *Bhagavad-gītā* (4.11) it is said, *ye yathā māṁ prapadyante tāṁs tathaiva bhajāmy aham.* There is a responsive cooperation between the Supreme Lord Kṛṣṇa and His devotees. The more a devotee sincerely loves Kṛṣṇa, the more Kṛṣṇa reciprocates, so much so that a highly advanced devotee can talk with Kṛṣṇa face to face. Kṛṣṇa confirms this in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (10.10):

*teṣāṁ satata-yuktānāṁ* *bhajatāṁ prīti-pūrvakam  
dadāmi buddhi-yogaṁ taṁ* *yena mām upayānti te*

“To those who are constantly devoted to serving Me with love, I give the understanding by which they can come to Me.” The actual mission of human life is to understand Kṛṣṇa and return home, back to Godhead. Therefore one who is sincerely engaged in the service of the Lord with love and faith can talk with Kṛṣṇa and receive instructions by which he can speedily return home, back to Godhead. Today many scholars defend the science of religion, and they have some conception of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but religion without practical experience of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is no religion at all. *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* describes this as a form of cheating. Religion means abiding by the orders of Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If one is not qualified to talk with Him and take lessons from Him, how can one understand the principles of religion? Thus talks of religion or religious experience without Kṛṣṇa consciousness are a useless waste of time.

### Purport

This is the way to install the Deity, construct the temple and increase the property of the temple. Everyone should be enthusiastic to contribute to the construction of the temple for the Deity, and everyone should also contribute food for the distribution of *prasādam.* The devotees should preach the gospel of devotional service and thus engage people in practical service to the Deity. Wealthy people can also be attracted to take part in these activities. In this way everyone will become spiritually inclined, and the entire society will be converted to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. The desire to satisfy the material senses will automatically diminish, and the senses will become so purified that they will be able to engage in *bhakti* (devotional service to the Lord). *Hṛṣīkeṇa hṛṣīkeśa-sevanaṁ bhaktir ucyate.* By serving the Lord, one’s senses are gradually purified. The engagement of one’s purified senses in the service of Lord Hṛṣīkeśa is called *bhakti.* When the dormant propensity for *bhakti* is awakened, one can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead as He is. *Bhaktyā mām abhijānāti yāvān yaś cāsmi tattvataḥ.* (Bg. 18.55) This is the process of giving humanity the chance to awaken Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Thus people can perfect their lives in all respects.

The disciples of the Gosvāmīs were entrusted with the *sevā-pūjā* (Deity worship) of these temples. It was not that the disciples were family members of the original Gosvāmīs. All the Gosvāmīs were in the renounced order of life, and Jīva Gosvāmī in particular was a lifelong *brahmacārī.* At present, *sevāitas* assume the title of *gosvāmī* on the basis of their being engaged as *sevāitas* of the Deity. The *sevāitas* who have inherited their positions now assume proprietorship of the temples, and some of them are selling the Deities’ property as if it were their own.

### Purport

The Deity of Gopāla had been buried within the jungle for many years, and although He was installed and was offered thousands of pots of water, He still felt very hot. He therefore asked Mādhavendra Purī to bring sandalwood from the Malaya province. Sandalwood produced in Malaya is very popular. That province is situated on the western *ghāṭa,* and the hill Nīlagiri is sometimes known as Malaya Hill. The word *malaya-ja* is used to indicate the sandalwood produced in Malaya Province. Sometimes the word Malaya refers to the modern country of Malaysia. Formerly this country also produced sandalwood, but now they have found it profitable to produce rubber trees. Although the Vedic culture was once prevalent in Malaysia, now all the inhabitants are Muslims. The Vedic culture is now lost in Malaysia, Java and Indonesia.

### Translation

**Advaita Ācārya begged to be initiated by Mādhavendra Purī. After initiating Him, Mādhavendra Purī started for South India.**

### Purport

In this connection, Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura comments that Advaita Ācārya took initiation from Mādhavendra Purī, who was a *sannyāsī* in the disciplic succession of the Madhva-sampradāya. According to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu:

*kibā vipra kibā nyāsī śūdra kene naya,  
yei kṛṣṇa-tattva-vettā, sei ‘guru’ haya*

“A person may be a *brāhmaṇa,* a *sannyāsī,* a *śūdra* or whatever, but if he is well conversant in the science of Kṛṣṇa, he can become a *guru.*” (Cc. *Madhya* 8.128) This statement is supported by Śrī Mādhavendra Purī. According to the *pañcarātra* injunction, only a householder *brāhmaṇa* can initiate. Others cannot. When a person is initiated, it is assumed that he has become a *brāhmaṇa;* without being initiated by a proper *brāhmaṇa,* one cannot be converted into a *brāhmaṇa.* In other words, unless one is a *brāhmaṇa,* he cannot make another a *brāhmaṇa.* A *gṛhastha-brāhmaṇa* partaking of the *varṇāśrama-dharma* institution can secure various types of paraphernalia to worship Lord Viṣṇu through his honest labor. Actually, people beg to be initiated by these householder *brāhmaṇas* just to become successful in the *varṇāśrama* institution or to become free from material desires. It is therefore necessary for a spiritual master in the *gṛhastha-āśrama* to be a strict Vaiṣṇava. A spiritual master from the *sannyāsa* order has very little opportunity to perform *arcana,* Deity worship, but when one accepts a spiritual master from the transcendental *sannyāsīs,* the principle of Deity worship is not at all neglected. To implement this conclusion, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu gave us His opinion in the verse *kibā vipra kibā nyāsī,* etc. This indicates that the Lord understood the weakness of society in its maintaining that only a *gṛhastha-brāhmaṇa* should be a spiritual master. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu indicated that it does not matter whether the spiritual master is a *gṛhastha* (householder), a *sannyāsī* or even a *śūdra.* A spiritual master simply must be conversant in the essence of the *śāstra;* he must understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Only then can one become a spiritual master. *Dīkṣā* actually means initiating a disciple with transcendental knowledge by which he becomes freed from all material contamination.

ayācita pāile khā’na, nahe upavāsa*

### Synonyms

*ayācita*-*vṛtti* — accustomed to avoid begging; *purī* — Mādhavendra Purī; *virakta* — unattached; *udāsa* — indifferent; *ayācita* — without begging; *pāile* — if getting; *khā’na* — he eats; *nahe* — if not; *upavāsa* — fasting.

### Translation

**Mādhavendra Purī avoided begging. He was completely unattached and indifferent to material things. If, without his begging, someone offered him some food, he would eat; otherwise he would fast.**

### Purport

This is the *paramahaṁsa* stage, the highest stage for a *sannyāsī.* A *sannyāsī* can beg from door to door just to collect food, but a *paramahaṁsa* who has taken *ayācita-vṛtti,* or *ājagara-vṛtti,* does not ask anyone for food. If someone offers him food voluntarily, he eats. *Ayācita-vṛtti* means being accustomed to refrain from begging, and *ājagara-vṛtti* indicates one who is compared to a python, the big snake that makes no effort to acquire food but rather allows food to come automatically within its mouth. In other words, a *paramahaṁsa* simply engages exclusively in the service of the Lord without caring even for eating or sleeping. It was stated about the six Gosvāmīs: *nidrāhāra-vihārakādi-vijitau.* In the *paramahaṁsa* stage one conquers the desire for sleep, food and sense gratification. One remains a humble, meek mendicant engaged in the service of the Lord day and night. Mādhavendra Purī had attained this *paramahaṁsa* stage.

kṣīra-icchā haila, tāhe māne aparādhe*

### Synonyms

*prema*-*amṛte* *tṛpta* — being satisfied only in the loving service of the Lord; *kṣudhā*-*tṛṣṇā* — hunger and thirst; *nāhi* — not; *bādhe* — impede; *kṣīra* — for sweet rice; *icchā* — the desire; *haila* — became; *tāhe* — for that reason; *māne* — he considers; *aparādhe* — offense.

### Translation

**A paramahaṁsa like Mādhavendra Purī is always satisfied in the loving service of the Lord. Material hunger and thirst cannot impede his activities. When he desired to taste a little sweet rice offered to the Deity, he considered that he had committed an offense by desiring to eat what was being offered to the Deity.**

### Purport

It is advisable that food being offered to the Deity be covered when taken from the kitchen to the Deity room. In that way, others may not see it. Those who are not accustomed to following the advanced regulative devotional principles may desire to eat the food, and that is an offense. Therefore no one should be given a chance to even see it. However, when it is brought before the Deity, it must be uncovered. Seeing the food uncovered before the Deity, Mādhavendra Purī desired to taste a little of it so that he could prepare a similar sweet rice for his Gopāla. Mādhavendra Purī was so strict, however, that he considered this to be an offense. Consequently he left the temple without saying anything to anyone. The *paramahaṁsa* is therefore called *vijita-ṣaḍ-guṇa.* He must conquer the six material qualities — *kāma, krodha, lobha, moha, matsarya* and *kṣudhā-tṛṣṇā* (lust, anger, greed, illusion, enviousness and hunger and thirst).

*grāmera śūnya-hāṭe vasi’ karena kīrtana

### Synonyms

*grāmera* — of the village; *śūnya*-*hāṭe* — in the vacant marketplace; *vasi’* — sitting down; *karena* — performs; *kīrtana* — chanting; *ethā* — in the temple; *pūjārī* — the priest; *karāila* — made; *ṭhākure* — the Deity; *śayana* — lying down.

### Translation

**Mādhavendra Purī left the temple and sat down in the village marketplace, which was vacant. Sitting there, he began to chant. In the meantime, the temple priest laid the Deity down to rest.**

### Purport

Although Mādhavendra Purī was not interested in eating and sleeping, his interest in chanting the *mahā-mantra* was as acute as if he were an aspiring transcendentalist rather than a *paramahaṁsa.* This means that even in the *paramahaṁsa* stage, one cannot give up chanting. Haridāsa Ṭhākura and the Gosvāmīs were all engaged in chanting a fixed number of rounds; therefore chanting on beads is very important for everyone, even though one may become a *paramahaṁsa.* This chanting can be executed anywhere, either inside or outside the temple. Mādhavendra Purī even sat down in a vacant marketplace to perform his chanting. As stated by Śrīnivāsa Ācārya in his prayers to the Gosvāmīs: *nāma-gāna-natibhiḥ.* A *paramahaṁsa* devotee is always engaged in chanting and rendering loving service to the Lord. Chanting the Lord’s holy names and engaging in His service are identical. As stated in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (7.5.23), there are nine kinds of devotional service: hearing (*śravaṇam*), chanting (*kīrtanam*), remembering (*viṣṇoḥ smaraṇam*), serving (*pāda-sevanam*), worship of the Deity (*arcanam*), praying (*vandanam*), carrying out orders (*dāsyam*), serving Him as a friend (*sakhyam*) and sacrificing everything for the Lord (*ātma-nivedanam*)*.* Although each process appears distinct, when one is situated on the absolute platform he can see that they are identical. For instance, hearing is as good as chanting, and remembering is as good as chanting or hearing. Similarly, engaging in Deity worship is as good as chanting, hearing or remembering. The devotee is expected to accept all nine processes of devotional service, but even if only one process is properly executed, he can still attain the highest position (*paramahaṁsa*) and go back home, back to Godhead.

*kṣīra laha ei, yāra nāma ‘mādhava-purī’

### Synonyms

*kṣīra* *laha* — take the pot of sweet rice; *ei* — this; *yāra* — whose; *nāma* — name; *mādhava*-*purī* — Mādhavendra Purī; *tomā* *lāgi’* — for you only; *gopīnātha* — the Deity of Lord Gopīnātha; *kṣīra* — the pot of sweet rice; *kaila* — did; *curi* — steal.

### Translation

**Holding the pot of sweet rice, the priest called, “Will he whose name is Mādhavendra Purī please come and take this pot! Gopīnātha has stolen this pot of sweet rice for you!”**

### Purport

The difference between the Absolute Truth and relative truth is explained here. Lord Gopīnātha has openly declared herein that He is a thief. He had stolen the pot of sweet rice, and this was not kept a secret because His act of stealing is a source of great transcendental bliss. In the material world, theft is criminal, but in the spiritual world the Lord’s stealing is a source of transcendental bliss. Mundane rascals, who cannot understand the absolute nature of the Personality of Godhead, sometimes call Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa immoral, but they do not know that His seemingly immoral activities, which are not kept secret, afford pleasure to the devotees. Not understanding the transcendental behavior of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, these rascals slur His character and immediately fall into the category of miscreants (rascals, lowest among men, demons and those whose knowledge is taken away by the illusory energy). Kṛṣṇa explains in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (7.15):

*na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ* *prapadyante narādhamāḥ  
māyayāpahṛta-jñānā* *āsuraṁ bhāvam āśritāḥ*

“Those miscreants who are grossly foolish, who are lowest among mankind, whose knowledge is stolen by illusion, and who partake of the atheistic nature of demons do not surrender unto Me.” (Bg. 7.15)

Mundane rascals cannot understand that whatever Kṛṣṇa does, being absolute in nature, is all-good. This quality of the Lord is explained in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (10.33.29). One may consider certain acts of a supremely powerful person to be immoral by mundane calculations, but this is not actually the case. For example, the sun absorbs water from the surface of the earth, but it does not absorb water only from the sea. It also absorbs water from filthy sewers and ditches containing urine and other impure substances. The sun is not polluted by absorbing such water. Rather, the sun makes the filthy place pure. If a devotee approaches the Supreme Personality of Godhead for an immoral or improper purpose, he nonetheless becomes purified; the Lord does not become infected. In *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (10.29.15) it is stated that if one approaches the Supreme Lord even out of lust, anger or fear (*kāmaṁ krodhaṁ bhayam*), he is purified. The *gopīs,* being young girls, approached Kṛṣṇa because He was a beautiful young boy. From the external point of view, they approached the Lord out of lust, and the Lord danced with them at midnight. From the mundane point of view, these activities may appear immoral because a married or unmarried young girl cannot leave home to mix with a young boy and dance with him. Although this is immoral from the mundane viewpoint, the activities of the *gopīs* are accepted as the highest form of worship because it was Lord Kṛṣṇa whom they approached with lusty desires in the dead of night.

But these things cannot be understood by nondevotees. One must understand Kṛṣṇa in *tattva* (truth). One should use his common sense and consider that if simply by chanting Kṛṣṇa’s holy name one is purified, how then can the person Kṛṣṇa be immoral? Unfortunately, mundane fools are accepted as educational leaders and are offered exalted posts for teaching irreligious principles to the general populace. This is explained in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (7.5.31): *andhā yathāndhair upanīyamānāḥ.* Blind men are trying to lead other blind men. Due to the immature understanding of such rascals, common men should not discuss Kṛṣṇa’s pastimes with the *gopīs.* A nondevotee should not even discuss His stealing sweet rice for His devotees. It is warned that one should not even think about these things. Although Kṛṣṇa is the purest of the pure, mundane people, thinking of Kṛṣṇa’s pastimes that appear immoral, themselves become polluted. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu therefore never publicly discussed Kṛṣṇa’s dealings with the *gopīs.* He used to discuss these dealings only with three confidential friends. He never discussed *rāsa-līlā* publicly, as the professional reciters do, although they do not understand Kṛṣṇa or the nature of the audience. However, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu encouraged the public chanting of the holy name on a huge scale for as many hours as possible.

*kṣīra lañā sukhe tumi karaha bhakṣaṇe  
tomā-sama bhāgyavān nāhi tribhuvane*

### Synonyms

*kṣīra* *lañā* — taking the pot of sweet rice; *sukhe* — in happiness; *tumi* — you; *karaha* — do; *bhakṣaṇe* — eating; *tomā*-*sama* — like you; *bhāgyavān* — fortunate; *nāhi* — there is no one; *tri*-*bhuvane* — within the three worlds.

### Translation

**The priest continued, “Would the sannyāsī whose name is Mādhavendra Purī please come and take this pot of sweet rice and enjoy the prasādam with great happiness! You are the most fortunate person within these three worlds!”**

### Purport

Here is an example of a personal benediction by Kṛṣṇa’s immoral activity. By Gopīnātha’s stealing for His devotee, the devotee becomes the most fortunate person within the three words. Thus even the Lord’s criminal activities make His devotee the most fortunate person. How can a mundane rascal understand the pastimes of Kṛṣṇa and judge whether He is moral or immoral? Since Kṛṣṇa is the Absolute Truth, there are no mundane distinctions such as moral and immoral. Whatever He does is good. This is the real meaning of “God is good.” He is good in all circumstances because He is transcendental, outside the jurisdiction of this material world. Therefore, Kṛṣṇa can be understood only by those who are already living in the spiritual world. This is corroborated in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (14.26):

*māṁ ca yo ’vyabhicāreṇa* *bhakti-yogena sevate  
sa guṇān samatītyaitān* *brahma-bhūyāya kalpate*

“One who engages in full devotional service, unfailing in all circumstances, at once transcends the modes of material nature and thus comes to the level of Brahman.”

One who is engaged in unalloyed devotional service to the Lord is already situated in the spiritual world (*brahma-bhūyāya kalpate*)*.* In all circumstances, his activities and dealings with Kṛṣṇa are transcendental and thus not understandable by mundane moralists. It is therefore better not to discuss such activities among mundane people. It is better to give them the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra* so that they will be gradually purified and then come to understand the transcendental activities of Kṛṣṇa.

### Verse text

*eta śuni’ purī-gosāñi paricaya dila  
kṣīra diyā pūjārī tāṅre daṇḍavat haila*

### Synonyms

*eta* *śuni’* — hearing this; *purī*-*gosāñi* — Mādhavendra Purī; *paricaya* — introduction; *dila* — gave; *kṣīra* *diyā* — delivering the pot of sweet rice; *pūjārī* — the priest; *tāṅre* — to him; *daṇḍavat* *haila* — offered obeisances.

### Translation

**Hearing this invitation, Mādhavendra Purī came out and identified himself. The priest then delivered the pot of sweet rice and offered his obeisances, falling flat before him.**

### Purport

A *brāhmaṇa* is not supposed to offer his obeisances by falling flat before anyone because a *brāhmaṇa* is considered to be in the highest caste. However, when a *brāhmaṇa* sees a devotee, he offers his *daṇḍavats.* This *brāhmaṇa* priest did not ask Mādhavendra Purī whether he was a *brāhmaṇa,* but when he saw that Mādhavendra Purī was such a bona fide devotee that Kṛṣṇa would even steal for him, he immediately understood the position of the saint. As stated by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu: *kibā vipra, kibā nyāsī, śūdra kene naya/ yei kṛṣṇa-tattva-vettā, sei ‘guru’ haya.* (Cc. *Madhya* 8.128) Had the *brāhmaṇa* priest been an ordinary *brāhmaṇa,* Gopīnātha would not have talked with him in a dream. Since the Deity spoke to both Mādhavendra Purī and the *brāhmaṇa* priest in dreams, practically speaking they were on the same platform. However, because Mādhavendra Purī was a senior *sannyāsī* Vaiṣṇava, a *paramahaṁsa,* the priest immediately fell flat before him and offered obeisances.

kṛṣṇa ye iṅhāra vaśa, — haya yathocita*

### Synonyms

*prema* *dekhi’* — seeing the ecstatic position of Mādhavendra Purī; *sevaka* — the priest; *kahe* — said; *ha*-*iyā* — being; *vismita* — struck with wonder; *kṛṣṇa* — Lord Kṛṣṇa; *ye* — that; *iṅhāra* — by him; *vaśa* — obliged; *haya* — it is; *yathocita* — befitting.

### Translation

**Upon seeing the ecstatic loving symptoms manifest in Mādhavendra Purī, the priest was struck with wonder. He could understand why Kṛṣṇa had become so much obliged to him, and he saw that Kṛṣṇa’s action was befitting.**

### Purport

A devotee can bring Kṛṣṇa perfectly under his control. This is explained in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (10.14.3): *ajita jito ’py asi tais tri-lokyām.* Kṛṣṇa is never conquered by anyone, but a devotee can conquer Him through devotional service. As stated in the *Brahma-saṁhitā* (5.33): *vedeṣu durlabham adurlabham ātma-bhaktau.* One cannot understand Kṛṣṇa simply by reading Vedic literature. Although all Vedic literature is meant for understanding Kṛṣṇa, one cannot understand Kṛṣṇa without being a lover of Kṛṣṇa. Therefore along with the reading of Vedic literature (*svādhyāya*), one must engage in devotional worship of the Deity (*arcana-vidhi*)*.* Together these will enhance the devotee’s transcendental understanding of devotional service. *Śravaṇādi śuddha-citte karaye udaya* (Cc. *Madhya* 22.107). Love of Godhead is dormant within everyone’s heart, and if one simply follows the standard process of devotional service, it is awakened. But foolish mundane people who simply read about Kṛṣṇa mistakenly think that He is immoral or criminal.

### Translation

**Being afraid of his reputation \[pratiṣṭhā\], Mādhavendra Purī fled from Remuṇā. But the reputation brought by love of Godhead is so sublime that it goes along with the devotee, as if following him.**

### Purport

Almost all the conditioned souls within the material world are envious. Jealous people generally turn against one who automatically attains some reputation. This is natural for jealous people. Consequently, when a devotee is fit to receive worldly reputation, he is envied by many people. This is quite natural. When a person, out of humility, does not desire fame, people generally think him quite humble and consequently give him all kinds of fame. Actually a Vaiṣṇava does not hanker after fame or a great reputation. Mādhavendra Purī, the king of Vaiṣṇavas, bore his reputation, but he wanted to keep himself outside of the vision of the general populace. He wanted to cover his real identity as a great devotee of the Lord, but when people saw him overwhelmed in the ecstasy of love of Godhead, they naturally gave credit to him. Actually a first-class reputation is due Mādhavendra Purī because he was a most confidential devotee of the Lord. Sometimes a *sahajiyā* presents himself as being void of desires for reputation (*pratiṣṭhā*) in order to become famous as a humble man. Such people cannot actually attain the platform of celebrated Vaiṣṇavas.

The Cāturmāsya period begins in the month of Āṣāḍha (June-July) from the day of Ekādaśī called Śayanā-ekādaśī, in the fortnight of the waxing moon. The period ends in the month of Kārttika (October-November) on the Ekādaśī day known as Utthānā-ekādaśī, in the fortnight of the waxing moon. This four-month period is known as Cāturmāsya. Some Vaiṣṇavas also observe it from the full-moon day of Āṣāḍha until the full-moon day of Kārttika. That is also a period of four months. This period, calculated by the lunar months, is called Cāturmāsya, but others also observe Cāturmāsya according to the solar month from Śrāvaṇa to Kārttika. The whole period, either lunar or solar, takes place during the rainy season. Cāturmāsya should be observed by all sections of the population. It does not matter whether one is a *gṛhastha* or a *sannyāsī.* The observance is obligatory for all *āśramas.* The real purpose behind the vow taken during these four months is to minimize the quantity of sense gratification. This is not very difficult. In the month of Śrāvaṇa one should not eat spinach, in the month of Bhādra one should not eat yogurt, and in the month of Āśvina one should not drink milk. One should not eat fish or other nonvegetarian food during the month of Kārttika. A nonvegetarian diet means fish and meat. Similarly, *masūra* dhal and *urad* dhal are also considered nonvegetarian. These two dhals contain a great amount of protein, and food rich in protein is considered nonvegetarian. On the whole, during the four-month period of Cāturmāsya one should practice giving up all food intended for sense enjoyment.

When the living entity feels spiritual separation from Kṛṣṇa (*kṛṣṇa-viraha*), he has achieved the prime success of life.

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu wanted to point out this intense love of Kṛṣṇa exhibited by Mādhavendra Purī. All Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s devotees later followed in the footsteps of Mādhavendra Purī, serving the Lord without personal considerations.

**“This is the natural result of intense love of Godhead. The devotee does not consider personal inconveniences or impediments. In all circumstances he wants to serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead.**

### Purport

It is natural for those who have developed intense love for Kṛṣṇa not to care for personal inconvenience and impediments. Such devotees are simply determined to execute the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead or His representative, the spiritual master. In all circumstances, even amidst the greatest dangers, they undeviatingly carry on with the greatest determination. This definitely proves the intense love of the servitor. As stated in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (10.14.8), *tat te ’nukampāṁ su-samīkṣamāṇaḥ:* those who seriously desire to get free from the clutches of material existence, who have developed intense love for Kṛṣṇa, are worthy candidates for going back home, back to Godhead. An intense lover of Kṛṣṇa does not care for any number of material discomforts, scarcity, impediments or unhappiness. It is said that when one sees apparent unhappiness or distress in a perfect Vaiṣṇava, it is not at all unhappiness for him; rather, it is transcendental bliss. In the *Śikṣāṣṭaka* (8), Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu has also instructed, *āśliṣya vā pāda-ratāṁ pinaṣṭu mām.* The intense lover of Kṛṣṇa is never deviated from his service, despite all difficulties and impediments brought before him.

### Purport

The uncontaminated devotees who strictly depend on the Vedānta philosophy are divided into four *sampradāyas,* or transcendental parties. Out of the four *sampradāyas,* the Śrī Madhvācārya-sampradāya was accepted by Mādhavendra Purī. Thus he took *sannyāsa* according to *paramparā,* the disciplic succession. Beginning from Madhvācārya down to the spiritual master of Mādhavendra Purī, the *ācārya* named Lakṣmīpati, there was no realization of devotional service in conjugal love. Śrī Mādhavendra Purī introduced the conception of conjugal love for the first time in the Madhvācārya-sampradāya, and this conclusion of the Madhvācārya-sampradāya was revealed by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu when He toured southern India and met the Tattvavādīs, who supposedly belonged to the Madhvācārya-sampradāya.

When Śrī Kṛṣṇa left Vṛndāvana and accepted the kingdom of Mathurā, Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī, out of ecstatic feelings of separation, expressed how Kṛṣṇa can be loved in separation. Thus devotional service in separation is central to this verse. Worship in separation is considered by the Gauḍīya-Madhva-sampradāya to be the topmost level of devotional service. According to this conception, the devotee thinks of himself as very poor and neglected by the Lord. Thus he addresses the Lord as *dīna-dayārdra nātha,* as did Mādhavendra Purī. Such an ecstatic feeling is the highest form of devotional service. Because Kṛṣṇa had gone to Mathurā, Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī was very much affected, and She expressed Herself thus: “My dear Lord, because of Your separation My mind has become overly agitated. Now tell Me, what can I do? I am very poor and You are very merciful, so kindly have compassion upon Me and let Me know when I shall see You.” Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was always expressing the ecstatic emotions of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī that She exhibited when She saw Uddhava at Vṛndāvana. Similar feelings, experienced by Mādhavendra Purī, are expressed in this verse. Therefore, Vaiṣṇavas in the Gauḍīya-Madhva-sampradāya say that the ecstatic feelings experienced by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu during His appearance came from Śrī Mādhavendra Purī through Īśvara Purī. All the devotees in the line of the Gauḍīya-Madhva-sampradāya accept these principles of devotional service.
