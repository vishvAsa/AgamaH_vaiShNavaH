CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE

The following summary of the twenty-third chapter is given by Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura in his *Amṛta-pravāha-bhāṣya.* In this chapter Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu describes the symptoms of emotion and love and the awakening of one’s original loving relationship with the Lord, as well as the characteristics of a devotee who has actually attained that stage. He then describes the gradual increase of love of God up to the point of *mahābhāva.* He then describes the five divisions of attraction and how they continue. He also describes the mellow derived from conjugal love, which is the supreme emotion. Conjugal love is divided into two categories — *svakīya* and *parakīya. Svakīya* refers to loving affairs between husband and wife, and *parakīya* refers to loving affairs between two lovers. There are a number of descriptions in this connection. There is also a description of the sixty-four transcendental qualities of Kṛṣṇa and the twenty-five transcendental qualities of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī.

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu then describes those candidates who are eligible to taste the mellows of devotional service. Their fundamental natures and their varieties are also described. The Lord also informs Sanātana Gosvāmī about all the confidential paraphernalia of devotional service. He gives a description of Goloka Vṛndāvana, where the Lord is engaged in His eternal pastimes described in the *Hari-vaṁśa.* There is also an opposing description and a favorable description of *keśa-avatāra.* All these instructions are mentioned herein.

In this way Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu blessed Sanātana Gosvāmī, placing His hand on his head. Thus Sanātana received the power to describe these subjects in books like *Hari-bhakti-vilāsa.*

### Translation

**“When that ecstatic emotional stage intensifies, it is called love of Godhead. Such love is life’s ultimate goal and the reservoir of all pleasure.**

### Purport

Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura summarizes this growth of love of Godhead as a gradual process. A person becomes interested in devotional service by some good fortune. Eventually he becomes interested in pure devotional service without material contamination. At that point, a person wants to associate with devotees. As a result of this association, he becomes more and more interested in discharging devotional service and hearing and chanting. The more one is interested in hearing and chanting, the more he is purified of material contamination. Liberation from material contamination is called *anartha-nivṛtti,* indicating a diminishing of all unwanted things. This is the test of development in devotional service. If one actually develops the devotional attitude, he must be freed from the material contamination of illicit sex, intoxication, gambling and meat-eating. These are the preliminary symptoms. When one is freed from all material contamination, his firm faith in devotional service awakens. When firm faith develops, a taste arises, and by that taste one becomes attached to devotional service. When this attachment intensifies, the seed of love of Kṛṣṇa fructifies. This position is called *prīti* or *rati* (affection) or *bhāva* (emotion). When *rati* intensifies, it is called love of Godhead. This love of Godhead is actually life’s highest perfection and the reservoir of all pleasure.

Thus devotional life is divided into two stages — *sādhana-bhakti* and *bhāva-bhakti. Sādhana-bhakti* refers to the development of devotional service through the regulative principles. The basic principle for the execution of devotional service is faith. Above that, there is association with devotees, and after that there is initiation by a bona fide spiritual master. After initiation, when one follows the regulative principles of devotional service, one becomes freed from all unwanted things. In this way one becomes firmly fixed and gradually develops a taste for devotional service. The more the taste grows, the more one desires to render service to the Lord. In this way one becomes attached to a particular mellow in the Lord’s service — *śānta, dāsya, sakhya, vātsalya* or *madhura.* As a result of such attachment, *bhāva* develops. *Bhāva-bhakti* is the platform of purified goodness. By such purified goodness, one’s heart melts in devotional service. *Bhāva-bhakti* is the first seed of love of Godhead. This emotional stage is there before one attains pure love. When that emotional stage intensifies, it is called *prema-bhakti,* or transcendental love of Godhead. This gradual process is also described in the following two verses, which are found in the *Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu* (1.4.15-16).

**“ ‘In the beginning there must be faith. Then one becomes interested in associating with pure devotees. Thereafter one is initiated by the spiritual master and executes the regulative principles under his orders. Thus one is freed from all unwanted habits and becomes firmly fixed in devotional service. Thereafter, one develops taste and attachment. This is the way of sādhana-bhakti, the execution of devotional service according to the regulative principles. Gradually emotions intensify, and finally there is an awakening of love. This is the gradual development of love of Godhead for the devotee interested in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.’**

### Purport

Mahārāja Parīkṣit’s expression of anxiety is explained in this verse. He says, “Let whatever is destined to happen take place. It doesn’t matter. Just let me see that not a moment of my time is wasted without a relationship with Kṛṣṇa.” One has to tolerate all obstacles on the path of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and one has to see that not a moment of his life is wasted outside of Kṛṣṇa’s service.

### Purport

In the *Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu* (2.1.4-5), the following definition is given:

*athāsyāḥ keśava-rater* *lakṣitāyā nigadyate  
sāmagrī-paripoṣeṇa* *paramā rasa-rūpatā*

*vibhāvair anubhāvaiś ca* *sāttvikair vyabhicāribhiḥ  
svādyatvaṁ hṛdi bhaktānām* *ānītā śravaṇādibhiḥ  
eṣā kṛṣṇa-ratiḥ sthāyī* *bhāvo bhakti-raso bhavet*

“Love for Kṛṣṇa, Keśava, as previously described, reaches the supreme state of being composed of mellows when its ingredients are fulfilled. By means of *vibhāva, anubhāva, sāttvika* and *vyabhicārī,* hearing and chanting are activated, and the devotee is able to taste love for Kṛṣṇa. Then attachment for Kṛṣṇa, or permanent ecstasy (*sthāyi-bhāva*), becomes the mellow of devotional service (*bhakti-rasa*)*.*”

### Purport

In the *Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu* (2.1.14), *vibhāva* is described as follows:

*tatra jñeyā vibhāvās tu* *raty-āsvādana-hetavaḥ  
te dvidhālambanā eke* *tathaivoddīpanāḥ pare*

“The cause bringing about the tasting of love for Kṛṣṇa is called *vibhāva. Vibhāva* is divided into two categories — *ālambana* (support) and *uddīpana* (awakening).”

In the *Agni Purāṇa* it is stated:

*vibhāvyate hi raty-ādir* *yatra yena vibhāvyate  
vibhāvo nāma sa dvedhā-* *lambanoddīpanātmakaḥ*

“That which causes love for Kṛṣṇa to appear is called *vibhāva.* That has two divisions — *ālambana* (in which love appears) and *uddīpana* (by which love appears).”

In the *Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu* (2.1.16), the following is stated about *ālambana:*

*kṛṣṇaś ca kṛṣṇa-bhaktāś ca* *budhair ālambanā matāḥ  
raty-āder viṣayatvena* *tathādhāratayāpi ca*

“The object of love is Kṛṣṇa, and the container of that love is the devotee of Kṛṣṇa. Learned scholars call them *ālambana* — the foundations.” Similarly, *uddīpana* is described as follows:

*uddīpanās tu te proktā* *bhāvam uddīpayanti ye  
te tu śrī-kṛṣṇa-candrasya* *guṇāś ceṣṭāḥ prasādhanam*

“Those things which awaken ecstatic love are called *uddīpana.* Mainly this awakening is made possible by the qualities and activities of Kṛṣṇa, as well as by His mode of decoration and the way His hair is arranged.” (B.r.s. 2.1.301) The *Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu* (2.1.302) also gives the following further examples of *uddīpana:*

*smitāṅga-saurabhe vaṁśa-* *śṛṅga-nūpura-kambavaḥ  
padāṅka-kṣetra-tulasī-* *bhakta-tad-vāsarādayaḥ*

“Kṛṣṇa’s smile, the fragrance of His transcendental body, His flute, bugle, ankle bells and conchshell, the marks on His feet, His place of residence, His favorite plant \[*tulasī*\], His devotees, and the observance of fasts and vows connected to His devotion all awaken the symptoms of ecstatic love.”

### Purport

The *Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu* (2.2.1) describes *anubhāva* as follows:

*anubhāvās tu citta-stha-* *bhāvānām avabodhakāḥ  
te bahir vikriyā prāyāḥ* *proktā udbhāsvarākhyayā*

“The many external ecstatic symptoms, or bodily transformations which indicate ecstatic emotions in the mind and which are also called *udbhāsvara,* are the *anubhāvas,* or subordinate ecstatic expressions of love.” Some of these symptoms are dancing, falling down and rolling on the ground, singing and crying very loudly, bodily contortions, loud vibrations, yawning, deep breathing, disregard for others, the frothing of saliva, mad laughter, spitting, hiccups and other, similar symptoms. All these symptoms are divided into two divisions — *śīta* and *kṣepaṇa.* Singing, yawning and so on are called *śīta.* Dancing and bodily contortions are called *kṣepaṇa.*

In his *Anubhāṣya,* Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura quotes the following verse from the Vedic literature describing *udbhāsvara:*

*udbhāsante sva-dhāmnīti* *proktā udbhāsvarā budhaiḥ  
nīvy-uttarīya-dhammilla-* *sraṁsanaṁ gātra-moṭanam  
jṛmbhā ghrāṇasya phullatvaṁ* *niśvāsādyāś ca te matāḥ*

“The ecstatic symptoms manifest in the external body of a person in ecstatic love are called *udbhāsvara* by learned scholars*.* Some of these are a slackening of the belt and a dropping of clothes and hair. Others are bodily contortions, yawning, a trembling of the front portion of the nostrils, heavy breathing, hiccupping and falling down and rolling on the ground. These are the external manifestations of emotional love.” *Stambha* and other symptoms are described in *Madhya-līlā* 14.167.

*Nirveda, harṣa* and other symptoms are explained in *Madhya-līlā* 14.167. The transitory elements (*vyabhicārī*) are described in the *Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu* (2.4.1—3) as follows:

*athocyante trayas triṁśad-* *bhāvā ye vyabhicāriṇaḥ  
viśeṣeṇābhimukhyena* *caranti sthāyinaṁ prati  
vāg-aṅga-sattva-sūcyā ye* *jñeyās te vyabhicāriṇaḥ*

unmajjanti nimajjanti* *stāyiny amṛta-vāridhau  
ūrmi-vad vardhayanty enaṁ* *yānti tad-rūpatāṁ ca te*

“There are thirty-three transitory elements, known as *vyabhicārī* ecstatic emotions. They especially wander about the permanent sentiments as assistants. They are to be known by words, by different symptoms seen in the limbs and in other parts of the body, and by the peculiar conditions of the heart. Because they set in motion the progress of the permanent sentiments, they are specifically called *sañcārī,* or impelling principles. These impelling principles rise up and fall back in the permanent sentiments of ecstatic love like waves in an ocean of ecstasy. Consequently they are called *vyabhicārī.*”

### Purport

Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura says that the mellow of neutrality increases to simple love of Godhead. In the mellow of servitorship, love of Godhead increases beyond that to affection, counterlove (anger based on love), love and attachment. Similarly, the mellow of friendship increases to affection, counterlove, love, attachment and subattachment. It is the same with the mellow of parental affection. The special feature of the mellow of friendship exhibited by personalities like Subala is that it increases from fraternal affection to counterlove, to spontaneous attachment, to subordinate attachment, and finally to the ecstasy where all the ecstatic symptoms continuously exist.

### Translation

**“There are two divisions of each of the five mellows — yoga \[connection\] and viyoga \[separation\]. Among the mellows of friendship and parental affection, there are many divisions of connection and separation.**

### Purport

In the *Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu* (3.2.93), these divisions are described:

*ayoga-yogāvetasya* *prabhedau kathitāv ubhau*

“In the mellows of *bhakti-yoga,* there are two stages — *ayoga* and *yoga.*” *Ayoga* (*viyoga*) is described in the *Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu* (3.2.94) as follows:

*saṅgābhāvo harer dhīrair* *ayoga iti kathyate  
ayoge tvan-manaskatvaṁ* *tad-guṇādy-anusandhayaḥ  
tat-prāpty-upāya-cintādyāḥ* *sarveṣāṁ kathitāḥ kriyāḥ*

“Learned scholars in the science of *bhakti-yoga* say that when there is an absence of association with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, separation takes place. In the stage of *ayoga* (separation), the mind is filled with Kṛṣṇa consciousness and is fully absorbed in thoughts of Kṛṣṇa. In that stage, the devotee searches out the transcendental qualities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is said that in that stage of separation, all the devotees in the different mellows are always active in thinking of ways to attain Kṛṣṇa’s association.”

The word *yoga* (“connection”) is thus described in the *Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu* (3.2.129):

*kṛṣṇena saṅgamo yas tu* *sa yoga iti kīrtyate*

“When one meets Kṛṣṇa directly, that is called *yoga.*”

In the transcendental mellows of neutrality and servitorship, there are similar divisions of *yoga* and *viyoga,* but they are not variegated. The divisions of *yoga* and *viyoga* are always existing in the five mellows. However, in the transcendental mellows of friendship and parental affection, there are many varieties of *yoga* and *viyoga.* The varieties of *yoga* are thus described:

*yogo ’pi kathitaḥ siddhis* *tuṣṭiḥ sthitir iti tridhā*

“*Yoga* (connection) is of three types — success, satisfaction and permanence.” (B.r.s. 3.2.129) The divisions of *ayoga* (separation) are described as follows:

*utkaṇṭhitaṁ viyogaś cety* *ayogo ’pi dvidhocyate*

“Thus *ayoga* has two divisions — longing and separation.” (B.r.s. 3.2.95)

### Purport

The *adhirūḍha* ecstasies are explained in the *Ujjvala-nīlamaṇi* (*Sthāyi-bhāva-prakaraṇa* 170):

*rūḍhoktebhyo ’nubhāvebhyaḥ* *kām apy āptā viśiṣṭatām

*Vipralambha* is described in the *Ujjvala-nīlamaṇi* (*Vipralambha-prakaraṇa* 3-4):

*yūnor ayuktayor bhāvo* *yuktayor vātha yo mithaḥ  
abhīṣṭāliṅganādīnām* *anavāptau prakṛṣyate*

*sa vipralambho vijñeyaḥ* *sambhogonnati-kārakaḥ  
na vinā vipralambhena* *sambhogaḥ puṣṭim aśnute*

“When the lover and the beloved meet, they are called *yukta* (connected). Previous to their meeting, they are called *ayukta* (not connected). Whether connected or not connected, the ecstatic emotion arising due to not being able to embrace and kiss each other as desired is called *vipralambha.* This *vipralambha* helps nourish emotions at the time of meeting.” Similarly, *sambhoga* is described in the following verse quoted from the Vedic literature by Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura in his *Anubhāṣya:*

*darśanāliṅganādīnām* *ānukūlyān niṣevayā  
yūnor ullāsam ārohan* *bhāvaḥ sambhoga īryate*

“Meeting each other and embracing each other are aimed at bringing about the happiness of the lover and the beloved. When this stage becomes increasingly jubilant, the resultant ecstatic emotion is called *sambhoga.*” When awakened, *sambhoga* is divided into four categories:

\(1\) *pūrva-rāga-anantara* — after *pūrva-rāga* (attachment prior to meeting), *sambhoga* is called brief (*saṅkṣipta*);

\(2\) *māna-anantara* — after *māna* (anger based on love), *sambhoga* is called encroached (*saṅkīrṇa*);

\(3\) *kiñcid-dūra-pravāsa-anantara* — after being a little distance away for some time, *sambhoga* is called accomplished (*sampanna*);

\(4\) *sudūra-pravāsa-anantara* — after being far away, *sambhoga* is called perfection (*samṛddhimān*)*.*

The meetings of the lovers that take place in dreams also have these four divisions.

The word *māna* is also described in the *Ujjvala-nīlamaṇi* (*Vipralambha-prakaraṇa* 68):

*dam-patyor bhāva ekatra* *sator apy anuraktayoḥ  
svābhīṣṭāśleṣa-vīkṣādi-* *nirodhī māna ucyate*

*“Māna* is a word used to indicate the mood of the lover and the beloved experienced whether they are in one place or in different places. This mood obstructs their looking at each other and embracing each other, despite the fact that they are attached to each other.”

*Pravāsa* is also explained in the *Ujjvala-nīlamaṇi* (*Vipralambha-prakaraṇa* 139), as follows:

*pūrva-saṅgatayor yūnor* *bhaved deśāntarādibhiḥ  
vyavadhānaṁ tu yat prājñaiḥ* *sa pravāsa itīryate*

*“Pravāsa* is a word used to indicate the separation of lovers who were previously intimately associated. This separation is due to their being in different places.”

Similarly, *prema-vaicittya* is also explained in the *Ujjvala-nīlamaṇi* (*Vipralambha-prakaraṇa* 134):

*priyasya sannikarṣe ’pi* *premotkarṣa-svabhāvataḥ  
yā viśeṣa-dhiyārtis tat* *prema-vaicittyam ucyate*

“*Prema-vaicittya* is a word used to indicate an abundance of love that brings about grief from fear of separation, although the lover is present.”

### Translation

**“ ‘These qualities are sometimes very minutely exhibited in living beings, but they are fully manifested in the Supreme Personality of Godhead.’**

### Purport

This verse is found in the *Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu* (2.1.30). Living entities are parts and parcels of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As Lord Kṛṣṇa states in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (15.7):

*mamaivāṁśo jīva-loke* *jīva-bhūtaḥ sanātanaḥ  
manaḥ-ṣaṣṭhānīndriyāṇi* *prakṛti-sthāni karṣati*

“The living entities in this conditioned world are My eternal, fragmental parts. Due to conditioned life, they are struggling very hard with the six senses, which include the mind.”

The qualities of Kṛṣṇa are present in the living entity in minute, atomic quantities. A small portion of gold is certainly gold, but it cannot be equal to a gold mine. Similarly, the living entities have all the characteristics of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in minute quantity, but the living entity is never equal to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. God is therefore described as the Supreme Being, and the living entity is described as a *jīva.* God is described as the Supreme Being, the chief of all living beings, because He is supplying the necessities of all others — *eko bahūnāṁ yo vidadhāti kāmān.* The Māyāvādīs maintain that everyone is God, but even if this philosophy is accepted, no one can maintain that everyone is equal to the Supreme Godhead in every respect. Only unintelligent men maintain that everyone is equal to God or that everyone is God.

There are another five qualities, which exist in the Vaikuṇṭha planets in Nārāyaṇa, the Lord of Lakṣmī. These qualities are also present in Kṛṣṇa, but they are not present in demigods like Lord Śiva or in other living entities. These are (1) the Lord possesses inconceivable supreme power, (2) He generates innumerable universes from His body, (3) He is the original source of all incarnations, (4) He bestows salvation upon enemies He kills, and (5) He has the ability to attract exalted persons who are satisfied in themselves. Although these qualities are present in Nārāyaṇa, the dominating Deity of the Vaikuṇṭha planets, they are even more wonderfully present in Kṛṣṇa.**

### Translation

**“ ‘Apart from these sixty transcendental qualities, Kṛṣṇa has an additional four transcendental qualities, which are not manifested even in the personality of Nārāyaṇa. These are: (1) Kṛṣṇa is like an ocean filled with waves of pastimes that evoke wonder within everyone in the three worlds. (2) In His activities of conjugal love, He is always surrounded by His dear devotees who possess unequaled love for Him. (3) He attracts the minds of all three worlds with the melodious vibration of His flute. (4) His personal beauty and opulence are beyond compare. No one is equal to Him, and no one is greater than Him. Thus the Personality of Godhead astonishes all living entities, both moving and nonmoving, within the three worlds. He is so beautiful that He is called Kṛṣṇa.**

### Purport

Māyāvādī philosophers, who have a poor fund of knowledge, simply dismiss the subject by explaining that *kṛṣṇa* means “black.” Not understanding the qualities of Kṛṣṇa, these atheistic rascals do not accept Him as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Although the Lord is described and accepted by great personalities, *ācāryas* and sages, the Māyāvādīs still do not appreciate Him. Unfortunately, at the present moment human society is so degraded that people cannot even provide themselves with life’s daily necessities, yet they are captivated by Māyāvādī philosophers and are being misled. According to the *Bhagavad-gītā,* simply by understanding Kṛṣṇa one can get free from the cycle of birth and death. *Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti so ’rjuna.* Unfortunately this great science of Kṛṣṇa consciousness has been impeded by Māyāvādī philosophers, who are opposed to the personality of Kṛṣṇa. Those who are preaching this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement must try to understand Kṛṣṇa from the statements given in the *Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu* (*The Nectar of* *Devotion*)*.*

### Purport

Sanātana Gosvāmī was enjoined (1) to broadcast the revealed scriptures on devotional service and establish the conclusions of devotional service, (2) to reestablish lost places of pilgrimage like Vṛndāvana and Rādhā-kuṇḍa, (3) to establish the Vṛndāvana method of temple worship and install Deities in temples (Śrī Sanātana Gosvāmī established the Madana-mohana temple, and Rūpa Gosvāmī established the Govindajī temple), and (4) to enunciate the behavior of a Vaiṣṇava (as Śrīla Sanātana Gosvāmī did in the *Hari-bhakti-vilāsa*)*.* In this way Sanātana Gosvāmī was empowered to establish the cult of Vaiṣṇavism. As stated by Śrīnivāsa Ācārya in his *Ṣaḍ-gosvāmy-aṣṭaka* (2):

*nānā-śāstra-vicāraṇaika-nipuṇau sad-dharma-saṁsthāpakau *
 *lokānāṁ hita-kāriṇau tri-bhuvane mānyau śaraṇyākarau  
rādhā-kṛṣṇa-padāravinda-bhajanānandena mattālikau *
 *vande rūpa-sanātanau raghu-yugau śrī-jīva-gopālakau*

“I offer my respectful obeisances unto the six Gosvāmīs, namely Śrī Sanātana Gosvāmī, Śrī Rūpa Gosvāmī, Śrī Raghunātha Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmī, Śrī Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī, Śrī Jīva Gosvāmī and Śrī Gopāla Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmī, who are very expert in scrutinizingly studying all the revealed scriptures with the aim of establishing eternal religious principles for the benefit of all human beings. Thus they are honored all over the three worlds, and they are worth taking shelter of because they are absorbed in the mood of the *gopīs* and are engaged in the transcendental loving service of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa.”

This Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement continues the tradition of the six Gosvāmīs, especially Śrīla Sanātana Gosvāmī and Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī. Serious students of this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement must understand their great responsibility to preach the cult of Vṛndāvana (devotional service to the Lord) all over the world. We now have a nice temple in Vṛndāvana, and serious students should take advantage of it. I am very hopeful that some of our students can take up this responsibility and render the best service to humanity by educating people in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

*yukta-vairāgya-sthiti saba śikhāila  
śuṣka-vairāgya-jñāna saba niṣedhila*

### Synonyms

*yukta*-*vairāgya* — of proper renunciation; *sthiti* — the situation; *saba* — all; *śikhāila* — instructed; *śuṣka*-*vairāgya* — dry renunciation; *jñāna* — speculative knowledge; *saba* — all; *niṣedhila* — forbade.

### Translation

**Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu then told Sanātana Gosvāmī about proper renunciation according to a particular situation, and the Lord forbade dry renunciation and speculative knowledge in all respects.**

### Purport

This is the technique for understanding *śuṣka-vairāgya* and *yukta-vairāgya.* In the *Bhagavad-gītā* (6.17) it is said:

*yuktāhāra-vihārasya* *yukta-ceṣṭasya karmasu  
yukta-svapnāvabodhasya* *yogo bhavati duḥkha-hā*

“He who is temperate in his habits of eating, sleeping, recreation and work can mitigate all material pains by practicing the *yoga* system.” To broadcast the cult of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, one has to learn the possibility of renunciation in terms of country, time and candidate. A candidate for Kṛṣṇa consciousness in the Western countries should be taught about the renunciation of material existence, but one would teach candidates from a country like India in a different way. The teacher (*ācārya*) has to consider time, candidate and country. He must avoid the principle of *niyamāgraha* — that is, he should not try to perform the impossible. What is possible in one country may not be possible in another. The *ācārya’s* duty is to accept the essence of devotional service. There may be a little change here and there as far as *yukta-vairāgya* (proper renunciation) is concerned. Dry renunciation is forbidden by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and we have also learned this from our spiritual master, His Divine Grace Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura Gosvāmī Mahārāja. The essence of devotional service must be taken into consideration, and not the outward paraphernalia.

Sanātana Gosvāmī wrote his Vaiṣṇava *smṛti, Hari-bhakti-vilāsa,* which was specifically meant for India. In those days, India was more or less following the principle of *smārta-vidhi.* Śrīla Sanātana Gosvāmī had to keep pace with this, and his *Hari-bhakti-vilāsa* was compiled with this in mind. According to *smārta-brāhmaṇas,* a person not born in a *brāhmaṇa* family could not be elevated to the position of a *brāhmaṇa.* Sanātana Gosvāmī, however, says in the *Hari-bhakti-vilāsa* (2.12) that anyone can be elevated to the position of a *brāhmaṇa* by the process of initiation.

*yathā kāñcanatāṁ yāti* *kāṁsyaṁ rasa-vidhānataḥ  
tathā dīkṣā-vidhānena* *dvijatvaṁ jāyate nṛṇām*

“As bell metal is turned to gold when mixed with mercury in an alchemical process, so one who is properly trained and initiated by a bona fide spiritual master immediately becomes a *brāhmaṇa*.”

There is a difference between the *smārta* process and the *gosvāmī* process. According to the *smārta* process, one cannot be accepted as a *brāhmaṇa* unless he is born in a *brāhmaṇa* family. According to the *gosvāmī* process, the *Hari-bhakti-vilāsa* and the *Nārada-pañcarātra,* anyone can be a *brāhmaṇa* if he is properly initiated by a bona fide spiritual master. This is also the verdict of Śukadeva Gosvāmī in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (2.4.18):

*kirāta-hūṇāndhra-pulinda-pulkaśā *
 *ābhīra-śumbhā yavanāḥ khasādayaḥ  
ye ’nye ca pāpā yad-apāśrayāśrayāḥ *
 *śudhyanti tasmai prabhaviṣṇave namaḥ*

“Kirātas, Hūṇas, Āndhras, Pulindas, Pulkaśas, Ābhīras, Śumbhas, Yavanas and members of the Khasa races, and even others who are addicted to sinful acts, can be purified by taking shelter of the devotees of the Lord, due to His being the supreme power. I beg to offer my respectful obeisances unto Him.”

A Vaiṣṇava is immediately purified, provided he follows the rules and regulations of his bona fide spiritual master. It is not necessary that the rules and regulations followed in India be exactly the same as those in Europe, America and other Western countries. Simply imitating without effect is called *niyamāgraha.* Not following the regulative principles but instead living extravagantly is also called *niyamāgraha.* The word *niyama* means “regulative principles,” and *āgraha* means “eagerness.” The word *agraha* means “not to accept.” We should not follow regulative principles without an effect, nor should we fail to accept the regulative principles. What is required is a special technique according to country, time and candidate. Without the sanction of the spiritual master, we should not try to imitate. This principle is recommended here: *śuṣka-vairāgya-jñāna saba niṣedhila.* This is Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s liberal demonstration of the *bhakti* cult. We should not introduce anything whimsically, without the sanction of the bona fide spiritual master. In this connection, Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura comments on these points by quoting two verses by Śrī Rūpa Gosvāmī (*Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu* 1.2.255-256).

*anāsaktasya viṣayān* *yathārham upayuñjataḥ  
nirbandhaḥ kṛṣṇa-sambandhe* *yuktaṁ vairāgyam ucyate*

*prāpañcikatayā buddhyā* *hari-sambandhi-vastunaḥ  
mumukṣubhiḥ parityāgo* *vairāgyaṁ phalgu kathyate*

“When one is not attached to anything but at the same time accepts everything in relation to Kṛṣṇa, one is rightly situated above possessiveness. On the other hand, one who rejects everything without knowledge of its relationship to Kṛṣṇa is not as complete in his renunciation.” To preach the *bhakti* cult, one should seriously consider these verses.

### Purport

One should not be jealous of members of other castes or nations. It is not that only Indians or *brāhmaṇas* can become Vaiṣṇavas. Anyone can become a Vaiṣṇava. Therefore one should recognize that the *bhakti* cult must be spread all over the world. That is real *adveṣṭā.* Moreover, the word *maitra,* “friendly,” indicates that one who is able to preach the *bhakti* cult all over the world should be equally friendly to everyone. These two and the following six verses were spoken by Śrī Kṛṣṇa in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (12.13-20).

The word *anapekṣa* means that one should not be concerned with mundane people and should not depend upon them. One should depend solely on the Supreme Personality of Godhead and be free from material desires. One should also be clean, within and without. To be outwardly clean, one should regularly bathe with soap and oil, and to be inwardly clean one should always be absorbed in thoughts of Kṛṣṇa. The words *sarvārambha-parityāgī* indicate that one should not be interested in the so-called *smārta-vidhi* of pious and impious activities.

Why then should learned persons like devotees go to flatter those who are intoxicated by hard-earned wealth?’ ”**

### Purport

This is a quotation from *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (2.2.5). In this verse, Śukadeva Gosvāmī advises Mahārāja Parīkṣit that a devotee should be independent in all circumstances. The body can be maintained with no problem if one follows the instructions given in this verse. To maintain the body, we require shelter, food, water and clothing, and all these necessities can be obtained without approaching puffed-up rich men. One can collect old garments that have been thrown out, one can eat fruits offered by the trees, one can drink water from the rivers, and one can live within the caves of mountains. By nature’s arrangements, shelter, clothing and food are supplied to the devotee who is completely surrendered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Such a devotee does not need a puffed-up materialistic person to maintain him. In other words, devotional service can be discharged in any condition. This is the version of *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (1.2.6):

*sa vai puṁsāṁ paro dharmo* *yato bhaktir adhokṣaje  
ahaituky apratihatā* *yayātmā suprasīdati*

“The supreme occupation \[*dharma*\] for all humanity is that by which men can attain to loving devotional service unto the transcendent Lord. Such devotional service must be unmotivated and uninterrupted in order to completely satisfy the self.” This verse explains that devotional service cannot be checked by any material condition.

### Purport

In the Vedic scripture *Hari-vaṁśa* (*Viṣṇu-parva,* chapter nineteen), there is the following description of Goloka Vṛndāvana:

*manuṣya-lokād ūrdhvaṁ tu* *khagānāṁ gatir ucyate  
ākāśasyopari ravir* *dvāraṁ svargasya bhānumān  
svargād ūrdhvaṁ brahma-loko* *brahmarṣi-gaṇa-sevitaḥ*

*upary upari tatrāpi* *gatis tava tapo-mayī  
yāṁ na vidmo vayaṁ sarve* *pṛcchanto ’pi pitām aham*

*gatiḥ śama-damāṭyānāṁ* *svargaḥ su-kṛta-karmaṇām  
brāhmye tapasi yuktānāṁ* *brahma-lokaḥ parā gatiḥ*

*gavām eva tu goloko* *durārohā hi sā gatiḥ  
sa tu lokas tvayā kṛṣṇa* *sīdamānaḥ kṛtātmanā  
dhṛto dhṛtimatā vīra* *nighnatopadravān gavām*

When the King of heaven, Indra, surrendered to Kṛṣṇa after Kṛṣṇa had raised Govardhana Hill, Lord Indra stated that above the planetary systems wherein human beings reside is the sky, where birds fly. Above the sky is the sun and its orbit. This is the entrance to the heavenly planets. Above the heavenly planets are other planets, up to Brahmaloka, where those advancing in spiritual knowledge reside. The planets up to Brahmaloka are part of the material world (Devī-dhāma). Because the material world is under the control of Devī, Durgā, it is called Devī-dhāma. Above Devī-dhāma is a place where Lord Śiva and his wife Umā reside. Those brightened by spiritual knowledge and liberated from material contamination reside in that Śivaloka. Beyond that planetary system is the spiritual world, where there are planets called Vaikuṇṭhalokas. Goloka Vṛndāvana is situated above all the Vaikuṇṭhalokas. Goloka Vṛndāvana is the kingdom of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī and the parents of Kṛṣṇa, Mahārāja Nanda and mother Yaśodā. In this way there are various planetary systems, and they are all creations of the Supreme Lord. As stated in the *Brahma-saṁhitā* (5.43):

*goloka-nāmni nija-dhāmni tale ca tasya *
 *devī-maheśa-hari-dhāmasu teṣu teṣu  
te te prabhāva-nicayā vihitāś ca yena *
 *govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi*

“Below the planet named Goloka Vṛndāvana are the planets known as Devī-dhāma, Maheśa-dhāma and Hari-dhāma. These are opulent in different ways. They are managed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda, the original Lord. I offer my obeisances unto Him.”

Thus Goloka Vṛndāvana-dhāma is situated above the Vaikuṇṭha planets. The spiritual sky containing all the Vaikuṇṭha planets is very small compared to Goloka Vṛndāvana-dhāma. The space occupied by Goloka Vṛndāvana-dhāma is called *mahākāśa,* or “the greatest sky of all.” Lord Indra said, “We asked Lord Brahmā about Your eternal planet, but we could not understand it. Those fruitive actors who have controlled their senses and mind with pious activities can be elevated to the heavenly planets. Pure devotees who are always engaged in Lord Nārāyaṇa’s service are promoted to the Vaikuṇṭha-lokas. However, my Lord Kṛṣṇa, Your Goloka Vṛndāvana-dhāma is very difficult to attain. Yet both You and that supreme planetary system have descended here upon this earth. Unfortunately, I have disturbed You by my misdeeds, and that was due to my foolishness. I am therefore trying to satisfy You by my prayers.”

Śrī Nīlakaṇṭha confirms the existence of Goloka Vṛndāvana-dhāma by quoting the *Ṛg-saṁhitā* (*Ṛg Veda* 1.154.6):

*tā vāṁ vāstūny uśmasi gamadhyai *
 *yatra gāvo bhūri-śṛṅgā ayāsaḥ  
atrāha tad urugāyasya kṛṣṇaḥ *
 *paramaṁ padam avabhāti bhūri*

“We wish to go to Your \[Rādhā’s and Kṛṣṇa’s\] beautiful houses, about which cows with large, excellent horns are wandering. Yet distinctly shining on this earth is that supreme abode of Yours that showers joy on all, O Urugāya \[Kṛṣṇa, who is much praised\].”

### Translation

**Illusory stories opposed to the conclusions of Kṛṣṇa consciousness concern the destruction of the Yadu dynasty, Kṛṣṇa’s disappearance, the story that Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma arise from a black hair and a white hair of Kṣīrodakaśāyī Viṣṇu, and the story about the kidnapping of the queens. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu explained to Sanātana Gosvāmī the proper conclusions of these stories.**

### Purport

Due to envy, many *asuras* describe Kṛṣṇa to be like a black crow or an incarnation of a hair. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu told Sanātana Gosvāmī how to counteract all these asuric explanations of Kṛṣṇa. The word *kāka* means crow, and *keśa* means hair. The *asuras* describe Kṛṣṇa as an incarnation of a crow, an incarnation of a *śūdra* (a blackish tribe) and an incarnation of a hair, not knowing that the word *keśa* means *ka-īśa* and that *ka* means Lord Brahmā and *īśa* means Lord. Thus the word *keśa* indicates that Kṛṣṇa is the Lord of Lord Brahmā.

Some of Lord Kṛṣṇa’s pastimes are mentioned in the *Mahābhārata* as *mauṣala-līlā.* These include the stories of the destruction of the Yadu dynasty, Kṛṣṇa’s disappearance, His being pierced by a hunter’s arrow, the story of Kṛṣṇa’s being an incarnation of a piece of hair (*keśa-avatāra*) as well as *mahiṣī-haraṇa,* the kidnapping of Kṛṣṇa’s queens. Actually these are not factual but are related for the bewilderment of the *asuras,* who want to prove that Kṛṣṇa is an ordinary human being. They are false in the sense that these pastimes are not eternal, nor are they transcendental or spiritual. There are many people who are by nature averse to the supremacy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Viṣṇu. Such people are called *asuras.* They have mistaken ideas about Kṛṣṇa. As stated in the *Bhagavad-gītā,* the *asuras* are given a chance to forget Kṛṣṇa more and more, birth after birth. Thus they make their appearance in a family of *asuras* and continue this process, being kept in bewilderment about Kṛṣṇa. *Asuras* in the dress of *sannyāsīs* even explain the *Bhagavad-gītā* and *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* in different ways according to their own imaginations. Thus they continue to remain *asuras* birth after birth.

As far as the *keśa-avatāra* (incarnation of a hair) is concerned, it is mentioned in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (2.7.26). The *Viṣṇu Purāṇa* also states, *ujjahārātmanaḥ keśau sita-kṛṣṇau mahā-bala.*

Similarly, it is stated in the *Mahābhārata* (*Ādi-parva* 189.31-32):

*sa cāpi keśau harir uccakarta *
 *ekaṁ śuklam aparaṁ cāpi kṛṣṇam  
tau cāpi keśāv āviśatāṁ yadūnāṁ *
 *kule striyau rohiṇīṁ devakīṁ ca*

*tayor eko balabhadro babhūva *
 *yo ’sau śvetas tasya devasya keśaḥ  
kṛṣṇo dvitīyaḥ keśavaḥ sambabhūva *
 *keśaḥ yo ’sau varṇataḥ kṛṣṇa uktaḥ*

Thus in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,* the *Viṣṇu Purāṇa* and the *Mahābhārata* there are references to Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma being incarnations of a black hair and a white hair respectively. It is stated that Lord Viṣṇu snatched two hairs — one white and one black — from His head. These two hairs entered the wombs of Rohiṇī and Devakī, members of the Yadu dynasty. Balarāma was born from Rohiṇī, and Kṛṣṇa was born of Devakī. Thus Balarāma appeared from the first hair, and Kṛṣṇa appeared from the second hair. It was also foretold that all the *asuras,* who are enemies of the demigods, would be cut down by Lord Viṣṇu by His white and black plenary expansions and that the Supreme Personality of Godhead would appear and perform wonderful activities. In this connection, one should see the *Laghu-bhāgavatāmṛta,* the chapter called *Kṛṣṇāmṛta,* verses 156-164. Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī has refuted this argument about the hair incarnation, and his refutation is supported by Śrī Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa’s commentaries. This matter is further discussed in the *Kṛṣṇa-sandarbha* (29) and in the commentary known as *Sarva-saṁvādinī,* by Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī.
