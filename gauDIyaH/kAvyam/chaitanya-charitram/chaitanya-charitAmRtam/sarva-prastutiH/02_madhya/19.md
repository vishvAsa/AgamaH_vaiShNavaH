CHAPTER NINETEEN

A summary of this chapter is given by Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura in his *Amṛta-pravāha-bhāṣya.* Meeting Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu in a village called Rāmakeli, two brothers, Rūpa and Sanātana, began to devise means to get out of their government service. They appointed some *brāhmaṇas* to perform *puraścaraṇa* ceremonies and chant the holy name of Kṛṣṇa. Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī deposited ten thousand gold coins with a grocer, and the balance he brought in two boats to a place called Bāklā Candradvīpa. There he divided this money among the *brāhmaṇas,* Vaiṣṇavas and his relatives, and a portion he kept for emergency measures and personal needs. He was informed that Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was going to Vṛndāvana from Jagannātha Purī through the forest of Jhārikhaṇḍa (Jharkhand); therefore he sent two people to Jagannātha Purī to find out when the Lord would leave for Vṛndāvana. In this way Rūpa Gosvāmī retired, but Sanātana Gosvāmī told the Nawab that he was sick and could not attend to his work. Giving this excuse, he sat at home and studied *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* with learned *brāhmaṇa* scholars. The Nawab Hussain Shah first sent his personal physician to see what the real facts were; then he personally came to see why Sanātana was not attending to official business. Knowing that he wanted to resign his post, the Nawab had him arrested and imprisoned. The Nawab then went off to attack Orissa.

When Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu started for Vṛndāvana through the forest of Jhārikhaṇḍa, Rūpa Gosvāmī left home and sent news to Sanātana that he was leaving with his younger brother (Anupama Mallika) to meet Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī finally reached Prayāga and met with Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu for ten successive days. During this time, Vallabha Bhaṭṭa extended an invitation to the Lord with great respect. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu introduced Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī to Vallabha Bhaṭṭa. After this, a *brāhmaṇa* scholar named Raghupati Upādhyāya arrived and discussed Kṛṣṇa consciousness with the Lord. Kavirāja Gosvāmī then extensively describes the living condition of Śrī Rūpa and Sanātana at Vṛndāvana. During the ten days at Prayāga, Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī was instructed by the Lord, who gave him the basic principles of the *Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu.* The Lord then sent Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī to Vṛndāvana. The Lord Himself returned to Vārāṇasī and stayed at the home of Candraśekhara.

### Translation

**Before the creation of this cosmic manifestation, the Lord enlightened the heart of Lord Brahmā with the details of the creation and manifested the Vedic knowledge. In exactly the same way, the Lord, being anxious to revive the Vṛndāvana pastimes of Lord Kṛṣṇa, impregnated the heart of Rūpa Gosvāmī with spiritual potency. By this potency, Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī could revive the activities of Kṛṣṇa in Vṛndāvana, activities almost lost to memory. In this way, He spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness throughout the world.**

### Translation

**The greedy masters of his clerical and secretarial staff performed the government duties while Sanātana personally remained home and discussed the revealed scriptures.**

### Purport

Sanātana Gosvāmī was the minister in charge of the government secretariat, and his assistants — the undersecretaries and clerks — all belonged to the *kāyastha* community. Formerly the *kāyasthas* belonged to the clerical and secretarial staff of the government, and later if one served in such a post, he was called a *kāyastha.* Eventually if a person could not identify himself as a *brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya* or *śūdra,* he used to introduce himself as a *kāyastha* to get a wealthy and honorable position. In Bengal it is said that if one cannot give the identity of his caste, he calls himself a *kāyastha.* On the whole, the *kāyastha* community is a mixture of all castes, and it especially includes those engaged in clerical or secretarial work. Materially such people are always busy occupying responsible government posts.

When Sanātana Gosvāmī was relaxing and feeling inclined to retire from government service, many *kāyasthas* on his secretarial staff were very eager to occupy his post. In this regard, Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura states that when Sanātana Gosvāmī was a government minister and the *kāyasthas* who assisted him saw that he was reluctant to continue, they became very expert in their duties. Sanātana Gosvāmī was a *brāhmaṇa* belonging to the Sārasvata *brāhmaṇa* community. It is said that when he resigned, a subordinate named Purandara Khān, who was a *kāyastha,* occupied his post.

### Translation

**Śrī Sanātana Gosvāmī used to discuss Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam in an assembly of twenty or thirty learned brāhmaṇa scholars.**

### Purport

Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura gives the following commentary on the words *bhāgavata vicāra.* As confirmed in the *Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad* (1.1.4-5), there are two kinds of educational systems:

*dve vidye veditavya iti, ha sma yad brahma-vido vadanti — parā caivāparā ca. tatrāparā ṛg-vedo yajur-vedaḥ sāma-vedo ’tharva-vedaḥ śikṣā kalpo vyākaraṇaṁ niruktaṁ chando jyotiṣam iti. atha parā yayā tad akṣaram adhigamyate.*

“There are two kinds of educational systems. One deals with transcendental knowledge \[*parā vidyā*\] and the other with material knowledge \[*aparā vidyā*\]*.* All the *Vedas* — the *Ṛg Veda, Yajur Veda, Sāma Veda* and *Atharva Veda,* along with their corollaries, known as *śikṣā, kalpa, vyākaraṇa, nirukta, chanda* and *jyotiṣa* — belong to the inferior system of material knowledge \[*aparā vidyā*\]*.* By *parā vidyā* one can understand the *akṣara* — Brahman or the Absolute Truth.” As far as the Vedic literature is concerned, the *Vedānta-sūtra* is accepted as the *parā vidyā. Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* is an explanation of that *parā vidyā.* Those who aspire for liberation (*mukti* or *mokṣa*) and introduce themselves as *vaidāntika* are also equal to those groups aspiring to improve religion (*dharma*)*,* economic development (*artha*) and sense gratification (*kāma*)*. Dharma, artha, kāma* and *mokṣa* are called *catur-varga.* They are all within the system of inferior, material knowledge. Any literature giving information about the spiritual world, spiritual life, spiritual identity and the spirit soul is called *parā vidyā. Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* does not have anything to do with the materialistic way of life; it gives transcendental information to educate people in the superior system of *parā vidyā.* Sanātana Gosvāmī was engaged in discussing the *bhāgavata-vidyā,* which means he discussed transcendental superior knowledge. Those who are *karmīs, jñānīs* or *yogīs* are not actually fit to discuss *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.* Only Vaiṣṇavas, or pure devotees, are fit to discuss that literature. As stated in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* itself (12.13.18):

*śrīmad-bhāgavataṁ purāṇam amalaṁ yad vaiṣṇavānāṁ priyaṁ *
 *yasmin pāramahaṁsyam ekam amalaṁ jñānaṁ paraṁ gīyate  
yatra jñāna-virāga-bhakti-sahitaṁ naiṣkarmyam āviṣkṛtaṁ *
 *tac chṛṇvan supaṭhan vicāraṇa-paro bhaktyā vimucyen naraḥ*

Although *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* is counted among the *Purāṇas,* it is called the spotless *Purāṇa.* Because it does not discuss anything material, it is liked by transcendental Vaiṣṇava devotees. The subject matter found in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* is meant for *paramahaṁsas.* As it is said, *paramo nirmatsarāṇāṁ satāṁ vedyam. A paramahaṁsa* is one who does not live in the material world and who does not envy others. In *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,* devotional service is discussed to arouse the living entity to the transcendental position of *jñāna* (knowledge) and *vairāgya* (renunciation). As stated in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (1.2.12):

*tac chraddadhānāḥ munayo* *jñāna-vairāgya-yuktayā  
paśyanty ātmani cātmānaṁ* *bhaktyā śruta-gṛhītayā*

“The seriously inquisitive student or sage, well equipped with knowledge and detachment, realizes that Absolute Truth by rendering devotional service in terms of what he has heard from the *Vedānta-śruti*.”

This is not sentiment. Knowledge and renunciation can be obtained through devotional service (*bhaktyā śruta-gṛhītayā*), that is, by arousing one’s dormant devotional consciousness, Kṛṣṇa consciousness. When Kṛṣṇa consciousness is aroused, it relieves one from fruitive activity, activity for economic improvement and material enjoyment. This relief is technically called *naiṣkarmya,* and when one is relieved, he is no longer interested in working hard for sense gratification. *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* is Śrīla Vyāsadeva’s last, mature contribution, and one should read and hear it in an assembly of realized souls while engaging in devotional service. At such a time one can be liberated from all material bondage. This was the course taken by Sanātana Gosvāmī, who retired from government service to study *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* with learned scholars.

ācambite gosāñi-sabhāte kaila āgamana*

### Synonyms

*āra* *dina* — one day; *gauḍa*-*īśvara* — the Nawab of Bengal; *saṅge* — with; *eka*-*jana* — one other person; *ācambite* — suddenly; *gosāñi*-*sabhāte* — in the assembly of Sanātana Gosvāmī; *kaila* *āgamana* — came.

### Purport

The full name of the Nawab of Bengal (Hussain Shah) was Ālāuddīna Saiyada Husena Sāha Seripha Makkā, and he ruled Bengal for twenty-three years, from 1420 to 1443 Śakābda Era (A.D. 1498 to 1521). Sanātana Gosvāmī was studying *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* with the scholars in the year 1424 (A.D. 1502).

पात्साह देखिय़ा सवे सम्भ्रमे उठिला ।

### Verse text

*pātsāha dekhiyā sabe sambhrame uṭhilā  
sambhrame āsana diyā rājāre vasāilā*

### Synonyms

*pātsāha* *dekhiyā* — seeing the Nawab; *sabe* — all of them; *sambhrame* — in great respect; *uṭhilā* — stood up; *sambhrame* — with great respect; *āsana* *diyā* — giving a sitting place; *rājāre* — the King; *vasāilā* — made to sit.

### Translation

**As soon as all the brāhmaṇas and Sanātana Gosvāmī saw the Nawab appear, they all stood up and respectfully gave him a sitting place to honor him.**

### Purport

Although Nawab Hussain Shah was a *mleccha-yavana,* he was nonetheless the governor of the country, and the learned scholars and Sanātana Gosvāmī offered him all the respect due a king or a governor. When a person occupies an exalted executive post, one should consider that he has acquired the grace of the Lord. In the *Bhagavad-gītā* (10.41) Lord Kṛṣṇa says:

*yad yad vibhūtimat sattvaṁ* *śrīmad ūrjitam eva vā  
tat tad evāvagaccha tvaṁ* *mama tejo-’ṁśa-sambhavam*

“Know that all opulent, beautiful and glorious creations spring from but a spark of My splendor.”

Whenever we see something exalted, we must consider it part of the power of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. A powerful man (*vibhūtimat sattvam*) is one who has obtained the grace of the Lord or has derived some power from Him. In the *Bhagavad-gītā* (7.10) Kṛṣṇa says, *tejas tejasvinām aham:* “I am the power of the powerful.” The learned *brāhmaṇa* scholars showed respect to Nawab Hussain Shah because he represented a fraction of Kṛṣṇa’s power.

It is said that the relationship between the Nawab of Bengal and Sanātana Gosvāmī was very intimate. The Nawab used to consider Sanātana Gosvāmī his younger brother, and when Sanātana Gosvāmī showed a very strong intention to resign, the Nawab, feeling familial affection, essentially said, “I am your elder brother, but I do not look after the state management. My only business is attacking other states with my soldiers and fighting everywhere as a plunderer. Because I am a meat-eater \[*yavana*\]*,* I am used to hunting all kinds of living beings. In this way I am destroying all kinds of living entities in Bengal. While engaged in this destructive business, I am hoping that you will tend to the administration of the state. Since I, your elder brother, am engaged in such a destructive business, you, being my younger brother, should look after the state management. If you do not, how will things continue?” This talk was based on a family relationship, and Sanātana Gosvāmī also replied in an intimate and joking way. Essentially he told the Nawab, “My dear brother, you are the independent ruler of Bengal. You can act in whatever way you like, and if someone commits a fault, you can punish him accordingly.” In other words, Sanātana Gosvāmī was saying that since the Nawab was accustomed to acting like a plunderer, he should go ahead and take action. Since Sanātana was not showing much enthusiasm for performing his duty, the Nawab should dismiss him from his service. The Nawab could understand the intention of Sanātana Gosvāmī’s statement. He therefore left in an angry mood and ordered Sanātana Gosvāmī’s arrest.

Indeed, all respects should be given to him, and whatever he offers should be accepted. Such devotees are as worshipable as I am.”’**

### Translation

**At that time, Śrī Vallabha Bhaṭṭa was staying at Āḍāila-grāma, and when he heard that Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu had arrived, he went to His place to see Him.**

### Purport

Vallabha Bhaṭṭa was a great learned scholar of Vaiṣṇavism. In the beginning he was very much devoted to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, but since he thought that he could not receive proper respect from Him, he later joined the Viṣṇu Svāmī sect and became the *ācārya* of that sect. His sect is celebrated as the Vallabhācārya-sampradāya. This *sampradāya* has had great influence in Vṛndāvana near Gokula and in Bombay. Vallabha Bhaṭṭa wrote many books, including a commentary on *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* called *Subodhinī-ṭīkā* and notes on the *Vedānta-sūtra* in the form of an *Anubhāṣya.* He also wrote a combination of sixteen short works called *Ṣoḍaśa-grantha.* The village where he was staying — Āḍāila-grāma, or Adelī-grāma — was near the confluence of the rivers Ganges and Yamunā, on the other side of the Yamunā from Prayāga, about one mile from the river. A temple of Lord Viṣṇu there still belongs to the Vallabha-sampradāya.

Vallabha Bhaṭṭa was originally from a place in southern India called Trailaṅga. There is a railway station there called Niḍāḍābhalu. Sixteen miles from that station is a village called Kāṅkaḍabāḍa, or Kākuṅrapāḍhu. A learned *brāhmaṇa* named Lakṣmaṇa Dīkṣita used to live there, and Vallabha Bhaṭṭa was his son. There are five sections of the *brāhmaṇa* community of Āndhra Pradesh, known as Bella-nāṭī, Vegī-nāṭī, Muraki-nāṭī, Telagu-nāṭī and Kāśala-nāṭī*.* Out of these five brahminical communities, Vallabhācārya took his birth in the community of Bella-nāṭī in the year 1400 Śakābda Era (A.D. 1478). According to some people, Vallabha Bhaṭṭācārya’s father took *sannyāsa* before Vallabha’s birth, and he returned home to take Vallabhācārya as his son. According to the opinion of others, Vallabhācārya was born in 1400 Śakābda Era on the Ekādaśī day of the dark moon in the month of Caitra, and he took his birth in a *brāhmaṇa* family surnamed Khambhaṁpāṭībāru. According to this account, his father’s name was Lakṣmaṇa Bhaṭṭa Dīkṣita, and he was born in Campakāraṇya. In someone else’s opinion, Vallabhācārya appeared near the village named Cāṅpā-jhāra-grāma, which is near a railway station named Rājima in Madhya Pradesh.

After studying for eleven years at Vārāṇasī, Vallabhācārya returned home. On his return, he heard that his father had departed from the material world. Keeping his brother and mother at home, he went to the banks of the river Tuṅgabhadrā, to a village called Vidyānagara, where he enlightened Kṛṣṇadeva, the grandson of King Bukkarāja. After that, he traveled throughout India thrice on trips lasting six years each. Thus he passed eighteen years and became victorious in his discussions of revealed scripture. When he was thirty years old, he married Mahālakṣmī, who belonged to the same *brāhmaṇa* community as his. Near Govardhana Hill he established a Deity in the valley. Finally he came to Āḍāila, which is on the other side of the Yamunā from Prayāga.

Vallabhācārya had two sons, Gopīnātha and Viṭhṭhaleśvara, and in his old age he accepted the renounced order. In 1452 Śakābda Era (A.D. 1530), he passed away from the material world at Vārāṇasī. His book known as *Ṣoḍaśa-grantha* and his commentaries on the *Vedānta-sūtra* (*Anubhāṣya*) and *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (*Subodhinī*) are very famous. He wrote many other books besides.

### Translation

**Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, “Don’t touch him, for he belongs to a very low caste. You are a follower of Vedic principles and are a well experienced performer of many sacrifices. You also belong to the aristocracy.”**

### Purport

Generally *brāhmaṇas* are puffed up with false prestige because they belong to the aristocracy and perform many Vedic sacrifices. In South India especially, this fastidious position is most prominent. At any rate, this was the case five hundred years ago. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu actually started a revolution against this brahminical system by inaugurating the chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra.* By this chanting, one can be delivered regardless of caste, creed, color or social position. Whoever chants the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra* is immediately purified due to the transcendental position of devotional service. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is here hinting to Vallabha Bhaṭṭācārya that an exalted *brāhmaṇa* who makes sacrifices and follows Vedic principles should not neglect a person who is engaged in devotional service by chanting the holy name of the Lord.

Actually Rūpa Gosvāmī did not belong to a lower caste. He was from a highly aristocratic *brāhmaṇa* family, but due to his association with the Muslim Nawab, he was considered fallen and was excommunicated from *brāhmaṇa* society. However, due to his advanced devotional service, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu accepted him as a *gosvāmī.* Vallabha Bhaṭṭācārya knew all this. One who is a devotee is above caste and creed, yet Vallabha Bhaṭṭācārya felt himself prestigious.

The present head of the Vallabha Bhaṭṭācārya *sampradāya* of Bombay is named Dīkṣita Mahārāja. He is very friendly to our movement, and whenever we meet him, this learned *brāhmaṇa* scholar highly praises the activities of the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement. He is a life member of our Society, and although he is a learned scholar in the brahminical caste tradition, he accepts our Society and considers its members bona fide devotees of Lord Viṣṇu.

### Translation

**Vallabha Bhaṭṭācārya said, “Since these two are constantly chanting the holy name of Kṛṣṇa, how can they be untouchable? On the contrary, they are most exalted.”**

### Purport

Vallabha Bhaṭṭācārya’s admission of the brothers’ exalted position should serve as a lesson to one who is falsely proud of his position as a *brāhmaṇa.* Sometimes so-called *brāhmaṇas* do not recognize our European and American disciples as devotees or *brāhmaṇas,* and some *brāhmaṇas* are so proud that they do not allow them to enter temples. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu herein gives a great lesson. Although Vallabha Bhaṭṭācārya was a great authority on brahmanism and a learned scholar, he admitted that those who chant the Lord’s holy name are bona fide *brāhmaṇas* and Vaiṣṇavas and are therefore exalted.

This is the wonderful effect of chanting the holy name of the Lord. It is therefore concluded that one who chants the holy name of the Lord should be understood to have performed all kinds of austerities and great sacrifices mentioned in the Vedas. He has already taken his bath in all the holy places of pilgrimage, he has studied all the Vedas, and he is actually an Āryan.’ ”**

### Translation

**“Of all Kṛṣṇa’s abodes, which do you think is the best?”**

### Purport

**Raghupati Upādhyāya said, “Madhu-purī, or Mathurā-dhāma, is certainly the best.”**

Lord Kṛṣṇa has many forms, as stated in the *Brahma-saṁhitā* (5.33): *advaitam acyutam anādim ananta-rūpam.* Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu asked Raghupati Upādhyāya which form was the best of Lord Kṛṣṇa’s millions of forms, and he immediately replied that the supreme form was the Śyāmasundara form. In that form, Kṛṣṇa stands curved in three places and holds His flute. The Śyāmasundara form is also described in the *Brahma-saṁhitā* (5.38):

*premāñjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena *
 *santaḥ sadaiva hṛdayeṣu vilokayanti  
yaṁ śyāmasundaram acintya-guṇa-svarūpaṁ *
 *govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi*

“I worship the primeval Lord, Govinda, who is always seen by the devotee whose eyes are anointed with the pulp of love. He is seen in His eternal form of Śyāmasundara, situated within the heart of the devotee.”

Those who are filled with ecstatic love for Kṛṣṇa always see the form of Śyāmasundara within their hearts. Raghupati Upādhyāya confirms that the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, has many incarnations — Nārāyaṇa, Nṛsiṁha, Varāha and others — but Kṛṣṇa is distinguished as the supermost. According to *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (1.3.28), *kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam:* “Kṛṣṇa is the original Personality of Godhead.” Kṛṣṇa means Śyāmasundara, who plays His flute in Vṛndāvana. Of all forms, this form is the best of all. Kṛṣṇa lives sometimes in Mathurā and sometimes in Dvārakā, but Mathurā is considered the better place. This is also confirmed by Rūpa Gosvāmī in his *Upadeśāmṛta* (9): *vaikuṇṭhāj janito varā madhu-purī.* “Madhu-purī, or Mathurā, is far superior to the Vaikuṇṭhalokas in the spiritual world.”

### Purport

*Parāsya śaktir vividhaiva śrūyate.* The Supreme Lord has multipotencies, which the Lord bestows on His fortunate devotees. The Lord has a special potency by which He spreads the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. This is explained in the *Caitanya-caritāmṛta* (*Antya* 7.11): *kali-kālera dharma — kṛṣṇa-nāma-saṅkīrtana/ kṛṣṇa-śakti vinā nahe tāra pravartana.* “One cannot spread the holy name of Kṛṣṇa without being specifically empowered by Lord Kṛṣṇa.” A devotee who receives this power from the Lord must be considered very fortunate. The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is spreading to enlighten people about their real position, their original relationship with Kṛṣṇa. One requires Kṛṣṇa’s special power in order to be able to do this. People forget their relationship with Kṛṣṇa and work under the spell of *māyā* life after life, transmigrating from one body to another. This is the process of material existence. The Supreme Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa personally descends to teach people that their position in the material world is a mistaken one. The Lord again comes as Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu to induce people to take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. The Lord also empowers a special devotee to teach people their constitutional position.

Although the Lord was transcendentally situated in His transcendental eternal form, at Prayāga He told Rūpa Gosvāmī about transcendental ecstatic love of Kṛṣṇa.

He very carefully followed the principles enunciated by the Lord, and he was a competent person to explain properly the pastimes of Lord Kṛṣṇa. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu expanded His mercy to Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī just so he could render service by writing transcendental literatures.”**

### Purport

Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī and Sanātana Gosvāmī had no fixed residence. They stayed beneath a tree for one day only and wrote huge volumes of transcendental literature. They not only wrote books but chanted, danced, discussed Kṛṣṇa and remembered Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s pastimes. Thus they executed devotional service.

In Vṛndāvana there are *prākṛta-sahajiyās* who say that writing books or even touching books is taboo. For them, devotional service means being relieved from these activities. Whenever they are asked to hear a recitation of Vedic literature, they refuse, saying, “What business do we have reading or hearing transcendental literatures? They are meant for neophytes.” They pose themselves as too elevated to exert energy for reading, writing and hearing. However, pure devotees under the guidance of Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī reject this *sahajiyā* philosophy. It is certainly not good to write literature for money or reputation, but to write books and publish them for the enlightenment of the general populace is real service to the Lord. That was Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī’s opinion, and he specifically told his disciples to write books. He actually preferred to publish books rather than establish temples. Temple construction is meant for the general populace and neophyte devotees, but the business of advanced and empowered devotees is to write books, publish them and distribute them widely. According to Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura, distributing literature is like playing on a great *mṛdaṅga.* Consequently we always request members of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness to publish as many books as possible and distribute them widely throughout the world. By thus following in the footsteps of Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī, one can become a *rūpānuga* devotee.

### Translation

**For ten days Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu stayed at Prayāga and instructed Rūpa Gosvāmī, empowering him with the necessary potency.**

### Purport

This is a confirmation of the statement *kṛṣṇa-śakti vinā nahe tāra pravartana.* Unless one is specifically empowered by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he cannot spread the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. An empowered devotee sees and feels himself to be the lowest of men, for he knows that whatever he does is due to the inspiration given by the Lord in the heart. This is confirmed by Lord Kṛṣṇa in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (10.10):

*teṣāṁ satata-yuktānāṁ* *bhajatāṁ prīti-pūrvakam  
dadāmi buddhi-yogaṁ taṁ* *yena mām upayānti te*

“To those who are constantly devoted to serving Me with love, I give the understanding by which they can come to Me.”

To be empowered by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one has to qualify himself. This means that one must engage twenty-four hours daily in the loving devotional service of the Lord. The material position of a devotee doesn’t matter because devotional service is not dependent on material considerations. In his earlier life, Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī was a government officer and a *gṛhastha.* He was not even a *brahmacārī* or *sannyāsī.* He associated with *mlecchas* and *yavanas,* but because he was always eager to serve, he was a qualified recipient for the Lord’s mercy. A sincere devotee can therefore be empowered by the Lord regardless of his situation. In the preceding verse from the *Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu,* Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī has described how he was personally empowered by the Lord. He further states in the *Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu* (1.2.187):

*īhā yasya harer dāsye* *karmaṇā manasā girā  
nikhilāsv apy avasthāsu* *jīvan-muktaḥ sa ucyate*

“A person acting in the service of Kṛṣṇa with his body, mind and words is a liberated person even in the material world, although he may be engaged in many so-called material activities.”

To keep oneself free from material contamination and attain the Lord’s favor, one must be sincerely eager to render service to the Lord. This is the only qualification necessary. As soon as one is favored by the mercy of the spiritual master and the Lord, one is immediately given all the power necessary to write books and propagate the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement without being hampered by material considerations.

### Translation

**“In this universe there are limitless living entities in 8,400,000 species, and all are wandering within this universe.**

### Purport

This is a challenge to so-called scientists and philosophers who presume that there are living entities on this planet only. So-called scientists are going to the moon, and they say that there is no life there. This does not tally with Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s version. He says that everywhere within the universe there are unlimited numbers of living entities in 8,400,000 different forms. In the *Bhagavad-gītā* (2.24) we find that the living entities are *sarva-gata,* which means that they can go anywhere. This indicates that there are living entities everywhere. They exist on land, in water, in air, in fire and in ether. Thus there are living entities in all types of material elements. Since the entire material universe is composed of five elements — earth, water, fire, air and ether — why should there be living entities on one planet and not others? Such a foolish version can never be accepted by Vedic students. From the Vedic literatures we understand that there are living entities on each and every planet, regardless of whether the planet is composed of earth, water, fire or air. These living entities may not have the same forms that are found on this planet earth, but they have different forms composed of different elements. Even on this earth we can see that the forms of land animals are different from the forms of aquatics. According to the circumstance, living conditions differ, but undoubtedly there are living entities everywhere. Why should we deny the existence of living entities on this or that planet? Those who have claimed to have gone to the moon have not gone there, or else with their imperfect vision they cannot actually perceive the particular type of living entities there.

The living entities are described as *ananta,* or unlimited; nonetheless, they are said to belong to 8,400,000 species. As stated in the *Viṣṇu Purāṇa:*

*jala-jā nava-lakṣāṇi* *sthāvarā lakṣa-viṁśati  
kṛmayo rudra-saṅkhyakāḥ* *pakṣiṇāṁ daśa-lakṣaṇam  
triṁśal-lakṣāṇi paśavaḥ* *catur-lakṣāṇi mānuṣāḥ*

“There are 900,000 species living in the water. There are also 2,000,000 nonmoving living entities (*sthāvara*), such as trees and plants. There are also 1,100,000 species of insects and reptiles, and there are 1,000,000 species of birds. As far as quadrupeds are concerned, there are 3,000,000 varieties, and there are 400,000 human species.” Some of these species may exist on one planet and not on another, but in any case within all the planets of the universe — and even in the sun — there are living entities. This is the verdict of the Vedic literatures. As the *Bhagavad-gītā* (2.20) confirms:

*na jāyate mriyate vā kadācin *
 *nāyaṁ bhūtvā bhavitā vā na bhūyaḥ  
ajo nityaḥ śāśvato ’yaṁ purāṇo *
 *na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre*

“For the soul there is neither birth nor death at any time. He has not come into being, does not come into being, and will not come into being. He is unborn, eternal, ever-existing and primeval. He is not slain when the body is slain.”

Since the living entities are never annihilated, they simply transmigrate from one life form to another. Thus there is an evolution of forms according to the degree of developed consciousness. One experiences different degrees of consciousness in different forms. A dog’s consciousness is different from a man’s. Even within a species we find that a father’s consciousness is different from his son’s and that a child’s consciousness is different from a youth’s. Just as we find different forms, we find different states of consciousness. When we see different states of consciousness, we may take it for granted that the bodies are different. In other words, different types of bodies depend on different states of consciousness. This is also confirmed in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (8.6):

*yaṁ yaṁ vāpi smaran bhāvaṁ* *tyajanty ante kalevaram  
taṁ tam evaiti kaunteya* *sadā tad bhāva-bhāvitaḥ*

“One’s consciousness at the time of death determines one’s type of body in the next life.” This is the process of transmigration of the soul. A variety of bodies is already there; we change from one body to another in terms of our consciousness.

### Purport

This is quoted from the commentary on the portion of *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* wherein the *Vedas* personified offer their obeisances unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Lord Kṛṣṇa confirms this statement in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (15.7): *mamaivāṁśo jīva-loke jīva-bhūtaḥ sanātanaḥ.* “The living entities in this conditioned world are My eternal fragmental parts.”

Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa personally identifies Himself with the minute living entities. Lord Kṛṣṇa is the supreme spirit, the Supersoul, and the living entities are His very minute parts and parcels. Of course, we cannot divide the tip of a hair into such fine particles, but spiritually such small particles can exist. Spiritual strength is so powerful that a mere atomic portion of spirit can be the biggest brain in the material world. The same spiritual spark is within an ant and within the body of Brahmā. According to his *karma,* material activities, the spiritual spark attains a certain type of body. Material activities are carried out in goodness, passion and ignorance or a combination of these. According to the mixture of the modes of material nature, the living entity is awarded a particular type of body. This is the conclusion.

If the living entities are simply satisfied with being identical with You as spiritual particles, then they will be happy being controllers of so many things. The conclusion that the living entities and the Supreme Personality of Godhead are one and the same is a faulty conclusion. It is not a fact.’**

### Verse text

*tāra madhye ‘sthāvara’, ‘jaṅgama’ — dui bheda  
jaṅgame tiryak-jala-sthalacara-vibheda*

### Synonyms

*tāra* *madhye* — among the living entities who are conditioned within the material world; *sthāvara* — immobile; *jaṅgama* — mobile; *dui* *bheda* — two divisions; *jaṅgame* — among the living entities who can move; *tiryak* — the living entities who can move in the air (the birds); *jala* — or living entities who can move within the water; *sthala*-*cara* — living entities who can move on land; *vibheda* — three divisions.

### Translation

**“The unlimited living entities can be divided into two divisions — those that can move and those that cannot move. Among living entities that can move, there are birds, aquatics and animals.**

### Purport

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is giving clear instructions on how the living entities live under different conditions. There are trees, plants and stones that cannot move, but still they must be considered living entities, or spiritual sparks. The soul is present in bodies like those of trees, plants and stones. They are all living entities. Among moving living entities such as birds, aquatics and animals, the same spiritual spark is there. As stated herein, there are living entities that can fly, swim and walk. We must also conclude that there are living entities that can move within fire and ether. Living entities have different material bodies composed of earth, water, air, fire and ether. The words *tāra madhye* mean “within this universe.” The entire material universe is composed of five material elements. It is not true that living entities reside only within this planet and not within others. Such a conclusion is completely contradictory to the *Vedas.* As stated in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (2.24):

*acchedyo ’yam adāhyo ’yam* *akledyo ’śoṣya eva ca  
nityaḥ sarva-gataḥ sthāṇur* *acalo ’yaṁ sanātanaḥ*

“This individual soul is unbreakable and insoluble, and can be neither burned nor dried. He is everlasting, present everywhere, unchangeable, immovable and eternally the same.”

The soul has nothing to do with the material elements. Any material element can be cut to pieces, especially earth. As far as the living entity is concerned, however, he can be neither burned nor cut to pieces. He can therefore live within fire. We can conclude that there are also living entities within the sun. Why should living entities be denied this planet or that planet? According to the *Vedas,* the living entities can live anywhere and everywhere — on land, in water, in air and in fire. Whatever the condition, the living entity is unchangeable (*sthāṇu*)*.* From the statements of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and the *Bhagavad-gītā,* we are to conclude that living entities exist everywhere throughout the universes. They are distributed as trees, plants, aquatics, birds, human beings and so on.

### Translation

**“Among human beings, those who are followers of the Vedic principles are considered civilized. Among these, almost half simply give lip service while committing all kinds of sinful activities against these principles. Such people do not care for the regulative principles.**

### Purport

The word *veda* means “knowledge.” Supreme knowledge consists of understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead and our relationship with Him and acting according to that relationship. Action in accordance with the Vedic principles is called religion. Religion means following the orders of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Vedic principles are the injunctions given by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Āryans are civilized human beings who have been following the Vedic principles since time immemorial. No one can trace out the history of the Vedic principles set forth so that man might understand the Supreme Being. Literature or knowledge that seeks the Supreme Being can be accepted as a bona fide religious system, but there are many different types of religious systems according to the place, the disciples and the people’s capacity to understand.

The highest type of religious system is described in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (1.2.6) thus: *sa vai puṁsāṁ paro dharmo yato bhaktir adhokṣaje.* The highest form of religion is that by which one becomes fully conscious of the existence of God, including His form, name, qualities, pastimes, abode and all-pervasive features. When everything is completely known, that is the perfection of Vedic knowledge. The fulfillment of Vedic knowledge is systematic knowledge of the characteristics of God. This is confirmed by Lord Kṛṣṇa in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (15.15): *vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyaḥ.* The aim of Vedic knowledge is to understand God. Therefore those who are actually following Vedic knowledge and searching after God cannot commit sinful activities against the Supreme Lord’s order. However, in this Age of Kali, although men profess to belong to so many different kinds of religions, most of them commit sinful activities against the orders of the Vedic scriptures. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu therefore says herein, *veda-niṣiddha pāpa kare, dharma nāhi gaṇe.* In this age, men may profess a religion, but they actually do not follow the principles. Instead, they commit all kinds of sins.

### Translation

### Purport

Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura states that the word *karma-niṣṭha* refers to one who aspires to enjoy the results of his good work and pious activity. Some followers of Vedic principles offer everything to the Absolute Truth and do not aspire to enjoy the results of their pious actions. These are also considered among the *karma-niṣṭhas.* Sometimes we see pious men earn money with great hardship and then spend the money for some pious cause by opening public charities, schools and hospitals. Whether one earns money for himself or for the public benefit, he is called a *karma-niṣṭha.* Out of millions of *karma-niṣṭhas* there may be one who is wise. Those who try to avoid fruitive activity and who become silent in order to merge into the spiritual existence of the Absolute Truth are generally known as *jñānīs,* wise men. They are not interested in fruitive activity but in merging into the Supreme. In either case, both the *karma-niṣṭhas* and the *jñānīs* are interested in personal benefit. The *karmīs* are directly interested in personal benefit within the material world, and the *jñānīs* are interested in merging into the existence of the Supreme. The *jñānīs* maintain that fruitive activity is imperfect. For them, perfection is the cessation of work and the merging into the supreme existence. That is their goal in life. The *jñānī* wants to extinguish the distinction between knowledge, the knower and the aim of knowledge. This philosophy is called monism, or oneness, and is characterized by spiritual silence.

### Translation

**“Out of many millions of such wise men, one may actually become liberated \[mukta\], and out of many millions of such liberated persons, a pure devotee of Lord Kṛṣṇa is very difficult to find.**

### Purport

In *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (10.2.32) it is said that due to their poor fund of knowledge, the *jñānīs* are not actually liberated. They simply think that they are liberated. The perfection of knowledge culminates when one comes to the platform of knowing the Supreme Personality of Godhead. *Brahmeti paramātmeti bhagavān iti śabdyate.* The Absolute Truth (*satya-vastu*) is described as Brahman, Paramātmā and Bhagavān. Knowledge of impersonal Brahman and the Supersoul is imperfect until one comes to the platform of knowing the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is therefore clearly said in this verse, *koṭi-mukta-madhye ‘durlabha’ eka kṛṣṇa-bhakta.* Those who search after the knowledge of impersonal Brahman or localized Paramātmā are certainly accepted as liberated, but due to their imperfect knowledge they are described in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* as *vimukta-māninaḥ.* Since their knowledge is imperfect, their conception of liberation is imperfect. Perfect knowledge is possible when one knows the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is supported by Lord Kṛṣṇa in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (5.29):

*bhoktāraṁ yajña-tapasāṁ* *sarva-loka-maheśvaram  
suhṛdaṁ sarva-bhūtānāṁ* *jñātvā māṁ śāntim ṛcchati*

“A person in full consciousness of Me, knowing Me to be the ultimate beneficiary of all sacrifices and austerities, the Supreme Lord of all planets and demigods, and the benefactor and well-wisher of all living entities, attains peace from the pangs of material miseries.”

Research is going on for the *karmīs, jñānīs* and *yogīs,* but until the search is complete, no one can attain peace. Therefore the *Bhagavad-gītā* says, *jñātvā māṁ śāntim ṛcchati:* one can actually attain peace when he knows Kṛṣṇa. This is described in the next verse.

### Translation

**“Because a devotee of Lord Kṛṣṇa is desireless, he is peaceful. Fruitive workers desire material enjoyment, jñānīs desire liberation, and yogīs desire material opulence; therefore they are all lusty and cannot be peaceful.**

### Purport

The devotee of Lord Kṛṣṇa has no desire other than serving Kṛṣṇa. Even so-called liberated people are full of desires. Fruitive actors desire better living accommodations, and *jñānīs* want to be one with the Supreme. *Yogīs* desire material opulence, yogic perfections and magic. All of these nondevotees are lusty (*kāmī*)*.* Because they desire something, they cannot have peace.

The peace formula is given by Kṛṣṇa in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (5.29):

*bhoktāraṁ yajña-tapasāṁ* *sarva-loka-maheśvaram  
suhṛdaṁ sarva-bhūtānāṁ* *jñātvā māṁ śāntim ṛcchati*

One who simply understands that throughout the entire universe Kṛṣṇa is the supreme enjoyer and beneficiary of all kinds of sacrifices, penances and austerities, which should be performed only to attain His devotional service, that Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Being and thus the proprietor of all the material worlds, and that Kṛṣṇa is the only friend who can actually do good to all living entities (*suhṛdaṁ sarvabhūtānām*) — one who understands these three principles about Kṛṣṇa immediately becomes desireless (*niṣkāma*) and therefore peaceful. A *kṛṣṇa-bhakta* knows that his friend and protector in all respects is Kṛṣṇa, who is able to do anything for His devotee. Kṛṣṇa says, *kaunteya pratijānīhi na me bhaktaḥ praṇaśyati:* “O son of Kuntī, declare it boldly that My devotee never perishes.” Since Kṛṣṇa gives this assurance, the devotee lives in Kṛṣṇa and has no desire for personal benefit. The background for the devotee is the all-good Himself. Why should the devotee aspire for something good for himself? His only business is to please the Supreme by rendering as much service as possible. A *kṛṣṇa-bhakta* has no desire for his own personal benefit. He is completely protected by the Supreme. *Avaśya rakṣibe kṛṣṇa viśvāsa pālana.* Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura says that he is desireless because Kṛṣṇa will give him protection in all circumstances. It is not that he expects any assistance from Kṛṣṇa; he simply depends on Kṛṣṇa just as a child depends on his parents. The child does not know how to expect service from his parents, but he is always protected nevertheless. This is called *niṣkāma* (desirelessness).

Although *karmīs, jñānīs* and *yogīs* fulfill their desires by performing various activities, they are never satisfied. A *karmī* may work very hard to acquire a million dollars, but as soon as he gets a million dollars he desires another million. For the *karmīs,* there is no end of desire. The more the *karmī* gets, the more he desires. The *jñānīs* cannot be desireless because their intelligence is unsound. They want to merge into the Brahman effulgence, but even though they may be raised to that platform, they cannot be satisfied there. There are many *jñānīs* or *sannyāsīs* who, after taking *sannyāsa* and giving up the world as false, return to the world to engage in politics or philanthropy or to open schools and hospitals. This means that they could not attain the real Brahman (*brahma satyam*)*.* They have to come down to the material platform to engage in philanthropic activity. Thus they again cultivate desires, and when these desires are exhausted, they desire something different. Therefore the *jñānī* cannot be *niṣkāma,* desireless. Nor can the *yogīs* be desireless, for they desire yogic perfections in order to exhibit some magical feats and gain popularity. People gather around these *yogīs,* and the *yogīs* desire more and more adulation. Because they misuse their mystic power, they fall down again to the material platform. It is not possible for them to become *niṣkāma,* desireless.

The conclusion is that only the devotees, who are simply satisfied in serving the Lord, can actually become desireless. Therefore Caitanya Mahāprabhu says here, *kṛṣṇa-bhakta niṣkāma.* Since the *kṛṣṇa-bhakta,* the devotee of Kṛṣṇa, is satisfied with Kṛṣṇa, there is no possibility of falldown.

**“ ‘O great sage, out of many millions of materially liberated people who are free from ignorance, and out of many millions of siddhas who have nearly attained perfection, there is hardly one pure devotee of Nārāyaṇa. Only such a devotee is actually completely satisfied and peaceful.’**

### Purport

This verse is quoted from *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (6.14.5). The *nārāyaṇa-parāyaṇa,* the devotee of Lord Nārāyaṇa, is the only blissful person. One who becomes a *nārāyaṇa-parāyaṇa* is already liberated from material bondage. He already possesses all the perfections of *yoga.* Unless one comes to the platform of *nārāyaṇa-parāyaṇa* and passes over the platform of *bhukti-mukti-siddhi,* he cannot be fully satisfied. That is the pure devotional stage.

*anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyaṁ* *jñāna-karmādy-anāvṛtam  
ānukūlyena kṛṣṇānu-* *śīlanaṁ bhaktir uttamā*

One who desires nothing but Kṛṣṇa and who is not influenced by the process of *jñāna-mārga* (cultivation of knowledge) actually becomes free from ignorance. A first-class person is one who is not influenced by *karma* (fruitive activity) or *yoga* (mystic power). He simply depends on Kṛṣṇa and is satisfied in his devotional service. According to *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (6.17.28): *nārāyaṇa-parāḥ sarve na kutaścana bibhyati.* Such a person is never afraid of anything. For him, heaven and hell are the same. Not knowing the situation of a *nārāyaṇaparāyaṇa,* rascals become envious. By the grace of Nārāyaṇa, a devotee is situated in the most opulent position in the material world. Rascals are envious of Nārāyaṇa and His devotee, but the devotee endeavors to please another devotee of Nārāyaṇa because he knows that by pleasing Nārāyaṇa’s representative one directly pleases Lord Nārāyaṇa. Therefore a devotee offers the best comforts and facilities to his spiritual master. Outsiders who have no knowledge of Nārāyaṇa are envious of both Nārāyaṇa and His devotee. Consequently when they see that Nārāyaṇa’s devotee is opulently situated, they become even more envious. But when the devotee of Nārāyaṇa asks such foolish people to come live with him in the same comfortable situation, they do not agree because they cannot give up illicit sex, meat-eating, intoxication and gambling. Therefore the materialist refuses the company of a *nārāyaṇa-parāyaṇa,* although he is envious of the devotee’s material situation. In Western countries when ordinary men — storekeepers and workers — see our devotees living and eating sumptuously and yet not working, they become very eager to know where they get the money. Such people become envious and ask, “How is it possible to live so comfortably without working? How is it you have so many cars, bright faces and nice clothes?” Not knowing that Kṛṣṇa looks after His devotees, such people become surprised, and some become envious.

### Translation

**“According to their karma, all living entities are wandering throughout the entire universe. Some of them are being elevated to the upper planetary systems, and some are going down into the lower planetary systems. Out of many millions of wandering living entities, one who is very fortunate gets an opportunity to associate with a bona fide spiritual master by the grace of Kṛṣṇa. By the mercy of both Kṛṣṇa and the spiritual master, such a person receives the seed of the creeper of devotional service.**

### Purport

When we speak of *brahmāṇḍa,* we refer to the whole universe, or to the cluster of many millions of universes. In all the universes there are innumerable planets, and there are innumerable living entities upon those planets — in the air, on land and in the water. There are millions and trillions of living entities everywhere, and they are engaged by *māyā* in suffering and enjoying the results of their fruitive activity, life after life. This is the position of the materially conditioned living entities. Out of many of these living entities, one who is actually fortunate (*bhāgyavān*) comes in contact with a bona fide spiritual master by Kṛṣṇa’s mercy.

Kṛṣṇa is situated in everyone’s heart, and if one desires something, Kṛṣṇa fulfills one’s desire. If the living entity by chance or fortune comes in contact with the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement and wishes to associate with that movement, Kṛṣṇa, who is situated in everyone’s heart, gives him the chance to meet a bona fide spiritual master. This is called *guru-kṛṣṇa-prasāda.* Kṛṣṇa is prepared to bestow His mercy upon all living entities, and as soon as a living entity desires the Lord’s mercy, the Lord immediately gives him an opportunity to meet a bona fide spiritual master. Such a fortunate person is fortified by both Kṛṣṇa and the spiritual master. He is helped from within by Kṛṣṇa and from without by the spiritual master. Both are prepared to help the sincere living being become free from material bondage.

How one can become this fortunate can be seen in the life of Śrīla Nārada Muni. In his previous life he was born of a maidservant. Although he was not born into a prestigious position, his mother was fortunately engaged in rendering service to some Vaiṣṇavas. When these Vaiṣṇavas were resting during the Cāturmāsya period, the boy Nārada took the opportunity to engage in their service. Taking compassion upon the boy, the Vaiṣṇavas offered him the remnants of their food. By serving these Vaiṣṇavas and obeying their orders, the boy became the object of their sympathy, and by the Vaiṣṇavas’ unknown mercy, he gradually became a pure devotee. In the next life he was Nārada Muni, the most exalted of Vaiṣṇavas and the most important *guru* and *ācārya* of Vaiṣṇavas.

Following in the footsteps of Nārada Muni, this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is rendering service to humanity by giving everyone a chance to come in contact with Kṛṣṇa. If one is fortunate, he becomes intimately related with this movement. Then, by the grace of Kṛṣṇa, one’s life becomes successful. Everyone has dormant *kṛṣṇa-bhakti* — love for Kṛṣṇa — and in the association of good devotees, that love is revealed. As stated in the *Caitanya-caritāmṛta* (*Madhya* 22.107):

*nitya-siddha-kṛṣṇa-prema ‘sādhya’ kabhu naya  
śravaṇādi-śuddha-citte karaye udaya*

Dormant devotional service to Kṛṣṇa is within everyone. Simply by associating with devotees, hearing their good instructions and chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra,* dormant love for Kṛṣṇa is awakened. In this way one acquires the seed of devotional service. *Guru-kṛṣṇa-prasāde pāya bhakti-latā-bīja.*

*mālī hañā kare sei bīja āropaṇa

### Synonyms

*mālī* *hañā* — becoming a gardener; *kare* — does; *sei* — that; *bīja* — seed of devotional service; *āropaṇa* — sowing; *śravaṇa* — of hearing; *kīrtana* — of chanting; *jale* — with the water; *karaye* — does; *secana* — sprinkling.

### Translation

**“When a person receives the seed of devotional service, he should take care of it by becoming a gardener and sowing the seed in his heart. If he waters the seed gradually by the process of śravaṇa and kīrtana \[hearing and chanting\], the seed will begin to sprout.**

### Purport

To live with devotees or to live in a temple means to associate with the *śravaṇa-kīrtana* process. Sometimes neophyte devotees think that they can continue the *śravaṇa-kīrtana* process without worshiping the Deity, but the execution of such *śravaṇa-kīrtana* is meant for highly developed devotees like Haridāsa Ṭhākura, who engaged in the *śravaṇa-kīrtana* process without worshiping the Deity. However, one should not falsely imitate Haridāsa Ṭhākura and abandon Deity worship just to try to engage in *śravaṇa-kīrtana.* This is not possible for neophyte devotees.

The word *guru-prasāda* indicates that the spiritual master is very merciful in bestowing the boon of devotional service upon the disciple. That is the best possible gift the spiritual master has to offer. Those with a background of pious life are eligible to receive life’s supreme benefit, and to bestow this benefit, the Supreme Personality of Godhead sends His representative to impart His mercy. endowed with the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the spiritual master distributes the mercy to those who are elevated and pious. Thus the spiritual master trains his disciples to render devotional service unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is called *guru-kṛpā.* It is *kṛṣṇa-prasāda,* Kṛṣṇa’s mercy, that He sends a bona fide spiritual master to the deserving disciple. By the mercy of Kṛṣṇa, one meets the bona fide spiritual master, and by the mercy of the spiritual master, the disciple is fully trained in the devotional service of the Lord.

*Bhakti-latā-bīja* means “the seed of devotional service.” Everything has an original cause, or seed. For any idea, program, plan or device, there is first of all the contemplation of the plan, and that is called the *bīja,* or seed. The methods, rules and regulations by which one is perfectly trained in devotional service constitute the *bhakti-latā-bīja,* or seed of devotional service. This *bhakti-latā-bīja* is received from the spiritual master by the grace of Kṛṣṇa. Other seeds, called *anyābhilāṣa-bīja,* include *karma-bīja* and *jñāna-bīja.* If one is not fortunate enough to receive the *bhakti-latā-bīja* from the spiritual master, he instead cultivates such seeds as *karma-bīja, jñāna-bīja,* or political, social or philanthropic *bījas.* However, the *bhakti-latā-bīja* is different from these other *bījas.* The *bhakti-latā-bīja* can be received only through the mercy of the spiritual master. Therefore one has to satisfy the spiritual master to get the *bhakti-latā-bīja* (*yasya prasādād bhagavat-prasādaḥ*)*.* The *bhakti-latā-bīja* is the origin of devotional service. Unless one satisfies the spiritual master, he gets the *bīja,* or root cause, of *karma, jñāna* and *yoga* without the benefit of devotional service. But one who is faithful to his spiritual master gets the *bhakti-latā-bīja.* This *bhakti-latā-bīja* is received when one is initiated by the bona fide spiritual master. After receiving the spiritual master’s mercy, one must repeat his instructions, and this is called *śravaṇa-kīrtana* — hearing and chanting. One who has not properly heard from the spiritual master or who does not follow the regulative principles is not fit for chanting (*kīrtana*)*.* This is explained in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (2.41): *vyavasāyātmikā buddhir ekeha kuru-nandana.* One who has not listened carefully to the instructions of the spiritual master is unfit for chanting or for preaching the cult of devotional service. One has to water the *bhakti-latā-bīja* by receiving instructions from the spiritual master.

### Synonyms

*upajiyā* — being cultivated; *bāḍe* — grows; *latā* — the creeper of devotional service; *brahmāṇḍa* — the whole universe; *bhedi’* — penetrating; *yāya* — goes; *virajā* — the river between the spiritual world and the material world; *brahma*-*loka* — the Brahman effulgence; *bhedi’* — penetrating; *para*-*vyoma* — the spiritual sky; *pāya* — attains.

### Translation

**“As one waters the bhakti-latā-bīja, the seed sprouts, and the creeper gradually grows to the point where it penetrates the walls of this universe and goes beyond the Virajā River, lying between the spiritual world and the material world. It attains brahma-loka, the Brahman effulgence, and penetrating through that stratum, it reaches the spiritual sky and the spiritual planet Goloka Vṛndāvana.**

### Purport

A creeper generally takes shelter of a big tree, but the *bhakti-latā,* being the creeper of spiritual energy, cannot take shelter of any material planet, for there is no tree on any material planet that the *bhakti* creeper can utilize for shelter. In other words, devotional service cannot be utilized for any material purpose. Devotional service is meant only for the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Sometimes men with a poor fund of knowledge maintain that *bhakti* can be applied to material things also. In other words, they say that devotional service can be rendered to one’s country or to the demigods, but this is not a fact. Devotional service is especially meant for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and it is beyond this material range. There is a river, or causal ocean, between the spiritual and material natures, and this river is free from the influence of the three modes of material nature; therefore it is called Virajā. The prefix *vi* means *vigata* (“completely eradicated”), and *rajas* means “the influence of the material world.” On this platform, a living entity is completely free from material entanglement. For the *jñānīs* who want to merge into the Brahman effulgence, there is Brahma-loka*.* The *bhakti-latā,* however, has no shelter in the material world, nor has it shelter in Brahma-loka, although Brahma-loka is beyond the material world. The *bhakti-latā* grows until it reaches the spiritual sky, where Goloka Vṛndāvana is situated.

### Translation

**“Being situated in one’s heart and being watered by śravaṇa-kīrtana, the bhakti creeper grows more and more. In this way it attains the shelter of the desire tree of the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, who is eternally situated in the planet known as Goloka Vṛndāvana, in the topmost region of the spiritual sky.**

### Purport

In the *Brahma-saṁhitā* (5.37) it is said:

*ānanda-cinmaya-rasa-pratibhāvitābhis *
 *tābhir ya eva nija-rūpatayā kalābhiḥ  
goloka eva nivasaty akhilātma-bhūto *
 *govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi*

“I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord. He resides in His own realm, Goloka, with Rādhā, who resembles His own spiritual figure and who embodies the ecstatic potency \[*hlādinī*\]*.* Their companions are Her confidantes, who embody extensions of Her bodily form and who are imbued and permeated with ever-blissful spiritual *rasa.*” In the spiritual world, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, has expanded Himself by His spiritual potency. He has His eternal form of bliss and knowledge (*sac-cid-ānanda-vigraha*)*.* Everything in the Goloka Vṛndāvana planet is a spiritual expansion of *sac-cid-ānanda.* Everyone there is of the same potency — *ānanda-cinmaya-rasa.* The relationship between the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His servitor is *cinmaya-rasa.* Kṛṣṇa and His entourage and paraphernalia are of the same *cinmaya* potency. In this way the Supreme Personality of Godhead is expanded throughout the spiritual world, and when that *cinmaya-rasa* potency expands through the material potency, it becomes all-pervading. The idea is that although the Supreme Personality of Godhead exists on His own planet, Goloka Vṛndāvana, He is also present everywhere. *Aṇḍāntara-stha-paramāṇu-cayāntara-stham.* He is present within all the universes, although they are innumerable, and He is also present within the atom. *Īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ hṛd-deśe ’rjuna tiṣṭhati:* He is also present within the heart of all living entities. This is His all-pervasive potency.

Goloka Vṛndāvana is the highest planet in the spiritual world. In order to go to the spiritual world after penetrating the covering of the material universe, one must penetrate Brahma-loka, the spiritual effulgence. Then one can come to the Goloka Vṛndāvana planet. There are also other planets in the spiritual world, called Vaikuṇṭha planets, and on these planets Lord Nārāyaṇa is worshiped with awe and veneration. On these planets *śānta-rasa* is prevalent, and some of the devotees are also connected with the Supreme Personality of Godhead in *dāsya-rasa,* the mellow of servitorship. As far as the mellow of fraternity is concerned, in Vaikuṇṭha this *rasa* is represented by *gaurava-sakhya,* friendship in awe and veneration. The other fraternity *rasa,* exhibited as *viśrambha* (friendship in equality), is found in the Goloka Vṛndāvana planet. Above that is service to the Lord in *vātsalya-rasa* (parental love), and above all is the relationship with the Lord in the *mādhurya-rasa* (conjugal love). These five *rasas* are fully exhibited in the spiritual world in one’s relationship with the Lord. Therefore in the spiritual world the *bhakti* creeper finds its resting place at the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa.

### Translation

**“The creeper greatly expands in the Goloka Vṛndāvana planet, and there it produces the fruit of love for Kṛṣṇa. Although remaining in the material world, the gardener regularly sprinkles the creeper with the water of hearing and chanting.**

### Purport

In Goloka Vṛndāvana the devotees have very intimate relationships with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The devotee engages in the Lord’s service in great ecstatic love. Such love was exhibited personally by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu in His teachings to the people of the material world. The fruit of the devotional creeper is the pure desire to serve and please the senses of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. *Kṛṣṇendriya-prīti-icchā dhare ‘prema’ nāma.* (Cc. *Ādi.* 4.165) In the spiritual world one has no desire other than to please the senses of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The conditioned soul within the material world can neither understand nor appreciate how a pure devotee in the material world can render confidential service to the Lord out of feelings of ecstatic love and always engage in pleasing the Supreme Lord’s senses. Although seen within this material world, the pure devotee always engages in the confidential service of the Lord. An ordinary neophyte devotee cannot realize this; therefore it is said, *vaiṣṇavera kriyā-mudrā vijñeha nā bujhaya.* The activities of a pure Vaiṣṇava cannot be understood even by a learned scholar in the material world.

Every living entity is wandering within this universe in different species and on different planetary systems according to his fruitive activities. Out of many millions of living entities, one may be fortunate enough to receive the seed of the *bhakti-latā,* the creeper of devotional service. By the grace of the spiritual master and Kṛṣṇa, one nourishes the *bhakti-latā* by regularly sprinkling it with the water of *śravaṇa-kīrtana,* hearing and chanting. In this way the seed of the *bhakti-latā* sprouts and grows up and up through the whole universe until it penetrates the covering of the material universe and reaches the spiritual world. The *bhakti-latā* continues to grow until it reaches the topmost planetary system, Goloka Vṛndāvana, where Kṛṣṇa lives. There the creeper takes shelter at the lotus feet of the Lord, and that is its final destination. At that time the creeper begins to grow the fruits of ecstatic love of God. It is the duty of the devotee who nourishes the creeper to be very careful. It is said that the watering of the creeper must continue: *ihāṅ mālī sece nitya śravaṇādi jala.* It is not that at a certain stage one can stop chanting and hearing and become a mature devotee. If one stops, one certainly falls down from devotional service. Although one may be very much exalted in devotional service, he should not give up the watering process of *śravaṇa-kīrtana.* If one gives up that process, it is due to an offense. This is described in the following verse.

### Synonyms

*yadi* — if; *vaiṣṇava*-*aparādha* — an offense at the feet of a Vaiṣṇava; *uṭhe* — arises; *hātī* — an elephant; *mātā* — mad; *upāḍe* — uproots; *vā* — or; *chiṇḍe* — breaks; *tāra* — of the creeper; *śukhi’* — shriveling up; *yāya* — goes; *pātā* — the leaf.

### Translation

**“If the devotee commits an offense at the feet of a Vaiṣṇava while cultivating the creeper of devotional service in the material world, his offense is compared to a mad elephant that uproots the creeper and breaks it. In this way the leaves of the creeper are dried up.**

### Purport

One’s devotional attitude increases in the association of a Vaiṣṇava:

*tāṅdera caraṇa sevi bhakta-sane vāsa  
janame janame haya, ei abhilāṣa*

By his personal example, Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura stresses that a devotee must always remember to please his predecessor *ācārya.* The Gosvāmīs are represented by one’s spiritual master. One cannot be an *ācārya* (spiritual master) without following strictly in the disciplic succession of the *ācāryas.* One who is actually serious about advancing in devotional service should desire only to satisfy the previous *ācāryas. Ei chaya gosāñi yāra, mui tāra dāsa.* One should always think of oneself as a servant of the servant of the *ācāryas,* and thinking this, one should live in the society of Vaiṣṇavas. However, if one thinks that he has become very mature and can live separate from the association of Vaiṣṇavas and thus gives up all the regulative principles due to offending a Vaiṣṇava, one’s position becomes very dangerous. Offenses against the holy name are explained in *Ādi-līlā,* chapter eight, verse 24. Giving up the regulative principles and living according to one’s whims is compared to a mad elephant, which by force uproots the *bhakti-latā* and breaks it to pieces. In this way the *bhakti-latā* shrivels up. Such an offense is especially created when one disobeys the instructions of the spiritual master. This is called *guru-avajñā.* The devotee must therefore be very careful not to commit offenses against the spiritual master by disobeying his instructions. As soon as one is deviated from the instructions of the spiritual master, the uprooting of the *bhakti-latā* begins, and gradually all the leaves dry up.

### Translation

**“The gardener must defend the creeper by fencing it all around so that the powerful elephant of offenses may not enter.**

### Purport

While the *bhakti* creeper is growing, the devotee must protect it by fencing it all around. The neophyte devotee must be protected by being surrounded by pure devotees. In this way he will not give the maddened elephant a chance to uproot his *bhakti* creeper. When one associates with nondevotees, the maddened elephant is set loose. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu has said, *asat-saṅga-tyāga, — ei vaiṣṇava-ācāra.* The first business of a Vaiṣṇava is to give up the company of nondevotees. A so-called mature devotee, however, commits a great offense by giving up the company of pure devotees. The human being is a social animal, and if one gives up the society of pure devotees, he must associate with nondevotees (*asat-saṅga*)*.* By contacting nondevotees and engaging in nondevotional activities, a so-called mature devotee will fall victim to the mad elephant offense. Whatever growth has taken place is quickly uprooted by such an offense. One should therefore be very careful to defend the creeper by fencing it in — that is, by following the regulative principles and associating with pure devotees.

Even if one thinks that there are many pseudo devotees or nondevotees in the Kṛṣṇa Consciousness Society, still one should stick to the Society; if one thinks the Society’s members are not pure devotees, one can keep direct company with the spiritual master, and if there is any doubt, one should consult the spiritual master. However, unless one follows the spiritual master’s instructions concerning the regulative principles and chanting and hearing the holy name of the Lord, one cannot become a pure devotee. By one’s mental concoctions, one falls down. By associating with nondevotees, one breaks the regulative principles and is thereby lost. In the *Upadeśāmṛta* (2) of Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī, it is said:

*atyāhāraḥ prayāsaś ca* *prajalpo niyamāgrahaḥ  
jana-saṅgaś ca laulyaṁ ca* *ṣaḍbhir bhaktir vinaśyati*

“One’s devotional service is spoiled when he becomes too entangled in the following six activities: (1) eating more than necessary or collecting more funds than required, (2) overendeavoring for mundane things that are very difficult to attain, (3) talking unnecessarily about mundane subject matters, (4) practicing the scriptural rules and regulations only for the sake of following them and not for the sake of spiritual advancement, or rejecting the rules and regulations of the scriptures and working independently or whimsically, (5) associating with worldly-minded persons who are not interested in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and (6) being greedy for mundane achievements.”

### Translation

**“Some unnecessary creepers growing with the bhakti creeper are the creepers of behavior unacceptable for those trying to attain perfection, diplomatic behavior, animal-killing, mundane profiteering, mundane adoration and mundane importance. All these are unwanted creepers.**

### Purport

There is a certain pattern of behavior prescribed for those actually trying to become perfect. In our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement we advise our students not to eat meat, not to gamble, not to engage in illicit sex and not to indulge in intoxication. People who indulge in these activities can never become perfect; therefore these regulative principles are for those interested in becoming perfect and going back to Godhead. *Kuṭīnāṭī,* or diplomatic behavior, cannot satisfy the *ātmā,* the soul. It cannot even satisfy the body or the mind. The culprit mind is always suspicious; therefore our dealings should always be straightforward and approved by Vedic authorities. If we treat people diplomatically or duplicitously, our spiritual advancement is obstructed. *Jīva-hiṁsana* refers to the killing of animals or to envy of other living entities. The killing of poor animals is undoubtedly due to envy of those animals. The human form is meant for the understanding of Kṛṣṇa consciousness (*athāto brahma-jijñāsā*), for inquiring about the Supreme Brahman. In the human form, everyone has a chance to understand the Supreme Brahman. The so-called leaders of human society do not know the real aim of human life and are therefore busy with economic development. This is misleading. Every state and every society is busy trying to improve the quality of eating, sleeping, mating and defending. This human form of life is meant for more than these four animal principles. Eating, sleeping, mating and defending are problems found in the animal kingdom, and the animals have solved these problems without difficulty. Why should human society be so busy trying to solve these problems? The difficulty is that people are not educated to understand this simple philosophy. They think that advancement of civilization means increasing sense gratification.

There are many religious propagandists who do not know how the ultimate problems of life can be solved, and they also try to educate people in a form of sense gratification. This is also *jīva-hiṁsana.* Real knowledge is not given, and religionists mislead the general populace. As far as material profits are concerned, one should know that whatever material profit one has must be abandoned at the time of death. Unfortunately people do not know that there is life after death; therefore mundane people waste their time amassing material profit which has to be left behind at the time of death. Such profit has no eternal benefit. Similarly, adoration by mundane people is valueless because after death one has to accept another body. Material adoration and titles are decorations that cannot be carried over to the next body. In the next life, everything is forgotten.

All these obstructions have been described in this verse as unwanted creepers. They simply present obstacles for the real creeper, the *bhakti-latā.* One should be very careful to avoid all these unwanted things. Sometimes these unwanted creepers look exactly like the *bhakti* creeper. They appear to be of the same size and the same species when they are packed together with the *bhakti* creeper, but in spite of this, the creepers are called *upaśākhā.* A pure devotee can distinguish between the *bhakti* creeper and a mundane creeper, and he is very alert to distinguish them and keep them separate.

### Translation

**“If one does not distinguish between the bhakti creeper and the other creepers, the sprinkling of water is misused because the other creepers are nourished while the bhakti creeper is curtailed.**

### Purport

If one chants the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra* while committing offenses, these unwanted creepers will grow. One should not take advantage of chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra* for some material profit. As mentioned in verse 159:

*‘niṣiddhācāra’, ‘kuṭīnāṭī’, ‘jīva-hiṁsana’  
‘lābha’, ‘pūjā’, ‘pratiṣṭhādi’ yata upaśākhā-gaṇa*

The unwanted creepers have been described by Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura. He states that if one hears and chants without trying to give up offenses, one becomes materially attached to sense gratification. One may also desire freedom from material bondage like the Māyāvādīs, or one may become attached to the *yoga-siddhis* and desire wonderful yogic powers. If one is attached to wonderful material activities, one is called *siddhi-lobhī,* greedy for material perfection. One may also be victimized by diplomatic or crooked behavior, or one may associate with women for illicit sex. One may make a show of devotional service like the *prākṛta-sahajiyās,* or one may try to support his philosophy by joining some caste or identifying himself with a certain dynasty, claiming a monopoly on spiritual advancement. Thus with the support of family tradition, one may become a pseudo *guru,* or so-called spiritual master. One may become attached to the four sinful activities — illicit sex, intoxication, gambling and meat-eating — or one may consider a Vaiṣṇava to belong to a mundane caste or creed. One may think, “This is a Hindu Vaiṣṇava, and this is a European Vaiṣṇava. European Vaiṣṇavas are not allowed to enter the temples.” In other words, one may consider Vaiṣṇavas in terms of birth, thinking one a *brāhmaṇa* Vaiṣṇava, another a *śūdra* Vaiṣṇava, another a *mleccha* Vaiṣṇava and so on. One may also try to carry out a professional business by means of chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra* or reading *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,* or one may try to increase his monetary strength by illegal means. Also, one may become a cheap Vaiṣṇava by trying to chant in a secluded place for material adoration, or one may desire mundane reputation by making compromises with nondevotees concerning one’s philosophy or spiritual life, or one may become a supporter of a hereditary caste system. All these are pitfalls of personal sense gratification. Just to cheat some innocent people, one makes a show of advanced spiritual life and becomes known as a *sādhu, mahātmā* or religious person. All this means that the so-called devotee has become victimized by all these unwanted creepers and that the real creeper, the *bhakti-latā,* has been stunted.

tabe mūla-śākhā bāḍi’ yāya vṛndāvana*

### Synonyms

*prathamei* — from the very beginning; *upaśākhāra* — of the unwanted creepers; *karaye* — does; *chedana* — the cutting away; *tabe* — then only; *mūla*-*śākhā* — the chief creeper; *bāḍi’* — growing; *yāya* — goes; *vṛndāvana* — to the lotus feet of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa in Vṛndāvana.

### Translation

**“As soon as an intelligent devotee sees an unwanted creeper growing beside the original creeper, he must cut it down instantly. Then the real creeper, the bhakti-latā, grows nicely, returns home, back to Godhead, and seeks shelter under the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa.**

### Purport

If one is misled by unwanted creepers and is victimized, he cannot make progress back to Godhead. Rather, he remains within the material world and engages in activities having nothing to do with pure devotional service. Such a person may be elevated to the higher planetary systems, but because he remains within the material world, he is subjected to the threefold material miseries.

### Synonyms

*eita* — this; *parama*-*phala* — the supreme goal of life; *parama* — supreme; *puruṣa*-*artha* — interest of the living being; *yāṅra* *āge* — in the presence of which; *tṛṇa*-*tulya* — very insignificant; *cāri* — four; *puruṣa*-*artha* — the different types of human interests.

### Translation

**“To taste the fruit of devotional service in Goloka Vṛndāvana is the highest perfection of life, and in the presence of such perfection, the four material perfections — religion, economic development, sense gratification and liberation — are very insignificant achievements.**

### Purport

The highest achievement attained by the *jñānīs,* or impersonalists, is becoming one with the Supreme, generally known as *mokṣa,* liberation. The highest achievements of the *yogīs* are the eight material perfections, such as *aṇimā, laghimā* and *prāpti.* Yet these are nothing compared to the eternal bliss of the devotee who returns back to Godhead and tastes the fruit of devotional service to the lotus feet of the Lord. The material perfections, even up to the point of liberation, are very insignificant in comparison; therefore the pure devotee is never interested in such things. His only interest is in perfecting his devotional service to the Lord. The pleasure of the impersonalist, monist philosophers is condemned in the following verse, which is also found in Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī’s *Lalita-mādhava.*

### Synonyms

*ṛddhā* — excellent; *siddhi*-*vraja* — of the groups of material perfections of the *yogīs* (*aṇimā, laghimā, prāpti* and so on); *vijayitā* — the victory; *satya*-*dharmā* — the religious principles of perfection (*satya, śama, titikṣā* and so on); *samādhiḥ* — the yogic perfection of meditation; *brahma*-*ānandaḥ* — the spiritually blissful life of the monist; *guruḥ* — very high in material considerations; *api* — although; *camatkārayati* — they appear very important; *eva* — only; *tāvat* — that long; *yāvat* — as long as; *premṇām* — of love of Kṛṣṇa; *madhu*-*ripu* — of Kṛṣṇa, the enemy of the Madhu demon; *vaśī*-*kāra* — in the controlling; *siddha*-*auṣadhīnām* — which is like perfect herbs that can control snakes; *gandhaḥ* — a slight fragrance; *api* — even; *antaḥ*-*karaṇa*-*saraṇī*-*pānthatām* — a traveler on the path of the heart; *na* *prayāti* — does not become.

### Translation

**“ ‘As long as there is not the slightest fragrance of pure love of Kṛṣṇa, which is the perfect medicinal herb for controlling Lord Kṛṣṇa within the heart, the opulences of the material perfections known as the siddhis, the brahminical perfections \[satya, śama, titikṣā and so on\], the trance of the yogīs and the monistic bliss of Brahman all seem wonderful for men.’**

### Purport

There are different types of perfections known as *siddhi-vraja,* and also the perfections of achieving brahminical qualifications, yogic trance and merging into the Supreme. All these material perfections are certainly very attractive for a mundane person, but their brilliance exists only as long as one does not take to devotional service. Devotional service can control the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the supreme controller of all universal affairs. The five *rasas* (mellows) in the transcendental world are practiced by the inhabitants of Goloka Vṛndāvana in neutrality, servitorship, friendship, parental affection and conjugal love. All these please the Lord so much that He is controlled by the devotees. For instance, mother Yaśodā was so advanced in devotional service that Kṛṣṇa agreed to be controlled by her stick. In other words, the five principal mellows are so great and glorious that they are able to control the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the material world, however, the so-called *siddhis,* or perfections, manifest their brightness only as long as one is not interested in devotional service. In other words, the perfection of the *karmīs, jñānīs, yogīs* and others remains attractive only as long as one does not come to the point of devotional service, which is so great and significant that it can control the supreme controller, Kṛṣṇa.

### Translation

**“ ‘When first-class devotional service develops, one must be devoid of all material desires, knowledge obtained by monistic philosophy, and fruitive action. The devotee must constantly serve Kṛṣṇa favorably, as Kṛṣṇa desires.’**

### Purport

This verse is also found in Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī’s *Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu* (1.1.11). As we can understand from the *Bhagavad-gītā* (9.34 and 18.65), the Supreme Personality of Godhead wants everyone to think of Him always (*man-manā bhava mad-bhaktaḥ*)*.* Everyone should become His devotee, not the devotee of a demigod. Everyone should engage in His devotional service, including *arcana* (Deity worship) in the temple. *Man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru.* Everyone should offer obeisances, from moment to moment, to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. These are the desires of the Supreme Lord, and one who fulfills His desires favorably is actually a pure devotee. Kṛṣṇa wants everyone to surrender unto Him, and devotional service means preaching this gospel all over the world. The Lord says openly in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (18.69), *na ca tasmān manuṣyeṣu kaścin me priya-kṛttamaḥ:* One who preaches the gospel of the *Bhagavad-gītā* for the benefit of all is most dear to Kṛṣṇa. The *Bhagavad-gītā* is spoken by the Lord so that human society can be perfectly organized from all angles of vision — politically, socially, economically, philosophically and religiously. From any point of view, human society can be reformed by the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement; therefore one who spreads this philosophy of Kṛṣṇa consciousness for the benefit of all conditioned souls in the universe is perfect in pure devotional service.

The criterion is that a devotee must know what Kṛṣṇa wants him to do. This understanding can be achieved through the medium of a spiritual master who is a bona fide representative of Kṛṣṇa. Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī advises, *ādau gurv-āśrayam.* One who is serious in wanting to render pure devotional service to the Lord must take shelter of a spiritual master who comes in the disciplic succession from Kṛṣṇa. *Evaṁ paramparā-prāptam imaṁ rājarṣayo viduḥ.* Without accepting a bona fide spiritual master coming in the disciplic succession, one cannot find out the real purpose of devotional service. Therefore one has to accept the shelter of a bona fide spiritual master and agree to be directed by him. The first business of a pure devotee is to satisfy his spiritual master, whose only business is to spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness. And if one can satisfy the spiritual master, Kṛṣṇa is automatically satisfied — *yasya prasādād bhagavat-prasādaḥ.* This is the success of devotional service. This is the meaning of the word *ānukūlyena* — that is, favorable devotional service to the Lord. A pure devotee has no plans other than those for the Lord’s service. He is not interested in attaining success in mundane activities. He simply wants success in the progress of devotional service. For a devotee, there cannot be worship of others or demigod worship. A pure devotee does not engage himself in such pseudo devotional service. He is interested only in satisfying Kṛṣṇa. If one lives only for the satisfaction of Kṛṣṇa, it does not matter whether he belongs to this order of life or that order of life. One’s only business should be to satisfy Kṛṣṇa. This process is completely manifest in the activities of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. It has been actually proved that the entire world can accept devotional service without failure. One simply has to follow the instructions of the representative of Kṛṣṇa.

Through discussion, one can create an interest and understanding of the *Pañcarātra* and *Bhāgavata* systems.

In other words, one must not desire material profit when rendering devotional service.

### Translation

**“By regularly rendering devotional service, one gradually becomes attached to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When that attachment is intensified, it becomes love of Godhead.**

### Purport

The *Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu* (1.2.2) gives the following information about *sādhana-bhakti:*

*kṛti-sādhyā bhavet sādhya-* *bhāvā sā sādhanābhidhā  
nitya-siddhasya bhāvasya* *prākaṭyaṁ hṛdi sādhyatā*

The process of devotional service — beginning with chanting and hearing — is called *sādhana-bhakti.* This includes the regulative principles that are intended to awaken one to devotional service. Devotional service is always dormant in everyone’s heart, and by the offenseless chanting of the holy names of the Lord, one’s original dormant Kṛṣṇa consciousness is awakened. This awakening to Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the beginning of *sādhana-bhakti.* This can be divided into many different parts, including faith, association with devotees, initiation by the spiritual master, engagement in devotional service under the instructions of a spiritual master, steadiness in devotional service and the awakening of a taste for devotional service. In this way, one can become attached to Kṛṣṇa and His service, and when this attachment is intensified, it results in ecstatic love for Kṛṣṇa. The word *rati* is explained in the *Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu* (1.3.41) as follows:

*vyaktaṁ masṛṇatevāntar-* *lakṣyate rati-lakṣaṇam  
mumukṣu-prabhṛtīnāṁ ced* *bhaved eṣā ratir na hi*

“When a tenderness of the heart is manifested, there is *rati,* or attachment. But those who are interested in being liberated from material bondage will not manifest this tenderness*.*” This attachment is not like material attachment. When one is free of material contamination, attachment for Kṛṣṇa’s service awakens and is called *rati.* In the material world there is attachment for material enjoyment, but this is not *rati.* Transcendental *rati* can be awakened only on the spiritual platform. Ecstatic love for Kṛṣṇa (*prema*) is described in the *Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu* (1.41) as follows:

*samyaṅ masṛṇita-svānto* *mamatvātiśayāṅkitaḥ  
bhāvaḥ sa eva sāndrātmā* *budhaiḥ premā nigadyate*

“When the heart is completely softened and devoid of all material desires and when one’s emotional feelings become very strong, one becomes very much attached to Kṛṣṇa. Such purified emotion is known as pure love.”

### Purport

In the *Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu,* (3.2.84) *sneha* (affection) is described as follows:

*sāndraś citta-dravaṁ kurvan* *premā sneha itīryate  
kṣaṇikasyāpi neha syād* *viśleṣasya sahiṣṇutā*

“That aspect of *prema* in which the melting of the heart for the lover is concentrated is called *sneha,* or affection. The symptom of such affection is that the lover cannot for a moment remain without the association of the beloved.” A description of *māna* can be found in *Madhya-līlā* (chapter two, verse 66). Similarly, a description of *praṇaya* is also there. As far as *rāga* is concerned, the *Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu* (3.2.87) says:

*snehaḥ sa rāgo yena syāt* *sukhaṁ duḥkham api sphuṭam  
tat-sambandha-lave ’py atra* *prītiḥ prāṇa-vyayair api*

“That stage at which affection for the beloved converts unhappiness into happiness is called *rāga,* or attachment. When one has such attachment for Kṛṣṇa, he can give up his own life to satisfy his beloved Kṛṣṇa.” *Anurāga, bhāva* and *mahābhāva* are described in the Sixth chapter of the *Madhya-līlā,* verse 13. The purport to that verse explains *adhirūḍha-mahābhāva.*

### Translation

**“All these stages combined are called sthāyibhāva, or continuous love of Godhead in devotional service. In addition to these stages, there are vibhāva and anubhāva.**

### Purport

Attachment for Kṛṣṇa never wanes; it increases more and more as one attains different stages. All the stages together are called *sthāyibhāva,* or continuous existence of ecstasy. The nine forms of devotional service are *śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ smaraṇaṁ pāda-sevanam arcanaṁ vandanaṁ dāsyaṁ sakhyam ātma-nivedanam.* When continuous love of Godhead is mixed with the processes of devotional service, it is called *vibhāva, anubhāva, sāttvika* and *vyabhicārī.* The devotee thus enjoys a variety of transcendental bliss. In his *Amṛta-pravāha-bhāṣya,* Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura states that *anubhāva* can be divided into thirteen categories: (1) dancing, (2) rolling on the ground, (3) singing, (4) yelling, (5) jumping, (6) making loud noises, (7) yawning, (8) heavy breathing, (9) not caring for public opinion, (10) discharging saliva, (11) roaring laughter, (12) unsteadiness and (13) hiccuping. These are the symptoms of *anubhāva.* Thus the transcendental mellows are experienced in different stages. Similarly, there are many other forms of expression that have been analytically studied by the Gosvāmīs. In the *Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu,* Rūpa Gosvāmī gives each and every symptom a particular name.

### Translation

**“According to the devotee, attachment falls within the five categories of śānta-rati, dāsya-rati, sakhya-rati, vātsalya-rati and madhura-rati. These five categories arise from devotees’ different attachments to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The transcendental mellows derived from devotional service are also of five varieties.**

### Purport

*Śānta-rati* is described in the *Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu* (2.5.16-18) as follows:

*mānase nirvikalpatvaṁ śama ity abhidhīyate*

“When one is completely free from all doubts and material attachments, he attains the neutral position, called *śānta.*”

*vihāya viṣayonmukhyaṁ* *nijānanda-sthitir yataḥ  
ātmanaḥ kathyate so ’tra* *vabhāvaḥ śama ity asau*

*prāyaḥ śama-pradhānānāṁ* *mamatā-gandha-varjitā  
paramātmatayā kṛṣṇe* *jātā śāntī ratir matā*

The *śānta-rati* realization of Kṛṣṇa is in the neutral stage between the conception of impersonalism and personalism. This means that one is not very strongly attached to the personal feature of the Lord. An appreciation of the greatness of the Lord is called *śānta-rati.* This is attachment not to the personal feature but to the impersonal feature. Generally, one in this stage is attached to the Paramātmā feature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

*īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ* *hṛd-deśe ’rjuna tiṣṭhati  
bhrāmayan sarva-bhūtāni* *yantrārūḍhāni māyayā*

“The Supreme Lord is situated in everyone’s heart, O Arjuna, and is directing the wanderings of all living entities, who are seated as on a machine made of the material energy.” (Bg. 18.61) On the strength of this statement from the *Bhagavad-gītā,* we can understand that in *śānta-rasa* a devotee sees the Lord’s representation everywhere.

*Dāsya-rati* is explained in the *Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu* (2.5.27) thus:

*svasmād bhavanti ye nyūnās* *te ’nugrāhyā harer matāḥ  
ārādhyatvātmikā teṣāṁ* *ratiḥ prītir itīritā  
tatrāsakti-kṛd anyatra* *prīti-saṁhāriṇī hy asau*

When the Supreme Lord in His localized aspect is appreciated and a great devotee understands his subordinate position, not only does he surrender to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but, due to his subordinate position, he wishes to render some service and thus become favored by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. A devotee in *śānta-rati* is not very much willing to render service to the Lord, but a devotee in *dāsya-rati* voluntarily wants to render service. Due to this attitude, the devotee in *dāsya-rati* realizes the Supreme Personality of Godhead more fully than a devotee in *śānta-rati.* He considers the Lord to be a worshipable object, and this means that his attachment for the Lord increases. Thus *dāsya-rati* is characterized as *bhaktiḥ pareśānubhavo viraktir anyatra ca.* (*Bhāg.* 11.2.42) In other words, on the *dāsya-rati* platform a devotee is attached to rendering service to the Lord, and he is detached from material activities. *Śānta-rati* is neither material nor spiritual, but *dāsya-rati* is actually on the spiritual platform. There is no attachment for material things on the spiritual platform (*viraktir anyatra ca*). A devotee in *dāsya-rati* has no attachment for anything but Kṛṣṇa’s service.

*Sakhya-rati* is described in the *Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu* (2.5.30) as follows:

*ye syus tulyā mukundasya* *te sakhāyaḥ satāṁ matāḥ  
sāmyād viśrambha-rūpaiṣāṁ* *ratiḥ sakhyam ihocyate*

According to the opinion of advanced devotees and learned scholars, a devotee in *sakhya-rati* feels equal to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is a relationship in friendship. Due to having a friendly relationship with the Lord, not only is one free from material attachment, but one believes in equal dealings with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is called *sakhya-rati.* The *sakhya-rati* devotee is so advanced that he treats the Lord on an equal level and even exchanges joking words with Him. Although one is never equal to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the *sakhya-rati* devotee feels equal to the Lord, and he does not feel guilty because of this. Usually it is offensive to consider oneself equal to the Lord. The Māyāvādīs, for example, consider themselves equal to the Lord, but such feelings entail bereavement because they are material. *Sakhya-rati,* however, is a feeling experienced in the mind by a pure devotee, and he is eternally related with the Supreme Personality of Godhead in that feeling.

*Vātsalya-rati* is described as follows in the *Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu* (2.5.33):

*guravo ye harer asya* *te pūjyā iti viśrutāḥ  
anugraha-mayī teṣāṁ* *ratir vātsalyam ucyate  
idaṁ lālana-bhavyāśīś* *cibuka-sparśanādi-kṛt*

When a living entity is situated on the platform of *vātsalya-rati,* he thinks of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His childhood feature. In this feature, the Lord has to be protected by the devotee, and at this time the devotee takes the position of being worshiped by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. These feelings of parental love are called *vātsalya-rati.* When the devotee is situated on this platform, he wants to maintain the Lord like a son, and he desires all good fortune for the Lord. He offers blessings to the Lord by touching His feet and head.

*Madhura-rati,* or attachment in conjugal love, is described as follows:

*mitho harer mṛgākṣyāś ca* *sambhogasyādi-kāraṇam  
madhurāpara-paryāyā* *priyatākhyoditā ratiḥ  
asyāṁ kaṭākṣa-bhrū-kṣepa-* *priya-vāṇī-smitādayaḥ*

Madhura-rati, the conjugal relationship experienced between the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the young damsels of Vrajabhūmi, continuously exists in eight kinds of remembrances. This intimate relationship brought about by conjugal love produces movements of the eyebrows, glancing, sweet words and exchanges of joking words.

### Translation

**“The chief transcendental mellows experienced with the Supreme Personality of Godhead are five — śānta, dāsya, sakhya, vātsalya and madhura.**

### Purport

*Śānta-bhakti-rasa* is described in the *Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu* (3.1.4-6) as follows:

 *vakṣyamāṇair vibhāvādyaiḥ* *śamināṁ svādyatāṁ gataḥ *
 *sthāyī śānti-ratir dhīraiḥ* *śānta-bhakti-rasaḥ smṛtaḥ*

 *prāyaḥ sva-sukha-jātīyaṁ* *sukhaṁ syād atra yoginām *
 *kintv ātma-saukhyam aghanaṁ* *ghanaṁ tv īśa-mayaṁ sukham*

 *tatrāpīśa-svarūpānu-* *bhavasyaivoru-hetutā *
 *dāsādi-van-mano-jñātva-* *līlāder na tathā matā*

When *śānta-rati* (neutral attraction) exists continuously and is mixed with ecstatic emotion, and when the devotee relishes that neutral position, it is called *śānta-bhakti-rasa. Śānta-bhakti-rasa* devotees generally relish the impersonal feature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Since their taste of transcendental bliss is incomplete, it is called *aghana,* or not concentrated. A comparison is made between ordinary milk and concentrated milk. When the same devotee goes beyond the impersonal and tastes the service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His original form as *sac-cid-ānanda-vigraha* (His transcendental, blissful body, complete in knowledge and eternity), the taste is called concentrated (*ghana*) transcendental bliss. Sometimes the devotees in *śānta-rasa* relish transcendental bliss after meeting the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but this is not comparable to the transcendental bliss relished by the devotees situated in *dāsya-rasa,* the transcendental mellow in which one renders service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

*Dāsya-rasa,* or *dāsya-bhakti-rasa,* is described in the *Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu* (3.2.3-4) as follows:

*ātmocitair vibhāvādyaiḥ* *prītir āsvādanīyatām  
nītā cetasi bhaktānāṁ* *prīti-bhakti-raso mataḥ*

*anugrāhy asya dāsatvāl* *lālyatvād apy ayaṁ dvidhā  
bhidyate sambhrama-prīto* *gaurava-prīta ity api*

When according to his desires the living entity develops love for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, this beginning stage of love is called *dāsya-bhakti-rasa. Dāsya-bhakti-rasa* is divided into two categories, called *sambhrama-dāsya* and *gaurava-dāsya.* In *sambhrama-dāsya,* the devotee renders respectful service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but in the more advanced *gaurava-dāsya,* the devotee feels he is receiving protection from the Lord.

*Sakhya-bhakti-rasa* is described as follows in the *Bhakti-rasāmṛta sindhu* (3.3.1):

*sthāyi-bhāvo vibhāvādyaiḥ* *sakhyam ātmocitair iha  
nītaś citte satāṁ puṣṭiṁ* *rasaḥ preyān udīryate*

“According to one’s original consciousness, ecstatic emotions may be exhibited as continuously existing in fraternity. When this stage of Kṛṣṇa consciousness is mature, it is called *preyo-rasa* or *sakhya-bhakti-rasa.*”

*Vātsalya-bhakti-rasa* is described in the *Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu* (3.4.1) as follows:

*vibhāvādyais tu vātsalyaṁ* *sthāyī puṣṭim upāgataḥ  
eṣa vatsala-nāmātra* *prokto bhakti-raso budhaiḥ*

“When eternally existing love of Godhead transforms into parental love and is mixed with corresponding emotions, that stage of spiritual existence is described by learned devotees as *vātsalya-bhakti-rasa.*”

*Madhura-bhakti-rasa* is described in the *Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu* (3.5.1) as follows:

*ātmocitair vibhāvādyaiḥ* *puṣṭiṁ nītā satāṁ hṛdi  
madhurākhyo bhaved bhakti-* *raso ’sau madhurā ratiḥ*

“If in accordance with one’s own natural development in Kṛṣṇa consciousness one’s attraction leans toward conjugal love within the heart, that is called attachment in conjugal love, or *madhura-rasa.*”

Similarly, *hāsya, adbhuta, vīra, karuṇa, raudra, bhaya* and *bībhatsa* — the seven indirect mellows — are explained in the *Bhaktirasāmṛta-sindhu.* The *hāsya-bhakti-rasa,* laughing devotion, is explained as follows (B.r.s. 4.1.6):

“When attachment to Kṛṣṇa mixes with the bellicose tendency, the charitable tendency or the merciful tendency in the heart of the devotee, such devotion is called *vīra-bhakti-rasa.*”

*Karuṇa-bhakti-rasa* is described as follows (B.r.s. 4.4.1):

*ātmocitair vibhāvādyair* *nītā puṣṭiṁ satāṁ hṛdi  
bhavec choka-ratir bhakti-* *raso hi karuṇābhidhaḥ*

“When one’s devotional attitude and attachment for Kṛṣṇa is mixed with lamentation, it is called *karuṇa-bhakti-rasa.*”

Similarly, *raudra-bhakti-rasa* is described as follows (B.r.s. 4.5.1):

*nītā krodha-ratiḥ puṣṭiṁ* *vibhāvādyair nijocitaiḥ  
hṛdi bhakta-janasyāsau* *raudra-bhakti-raso bhavet*

“When devotion is mixed with anger in the heart of the devotee, the taste is called *raudra-bhakti-rasa.*”

*Bhayānaka-bhakti-rasa* is described as follows (B.r.s. 4.6.1):

“When one’s attachment for Kṛṣṇa develops in an abominable way, and the devotee enjoys it, that is called *bībhatsa-bhakti-rasa.*”

In conclusion, when a pure devotee is situated in any of the five principal mellows (*śānta, dāsya, sakhya, vātsalya* or *madhura*) and that mellow is mixed with one or more of the seven indirect *bhakti-rasas* (*hāsya, adbhuta, vīra, karuṇa, raudra, bhayānaka* or *bībhatsa*), the indirect mellows become prominent.

### Purport

This verse from *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (10.60.24) refers to Kṛṣṇa’s speaking to Rukmiṇī in His bedroom.

There is no question of actually comparing oneself to Kṛṣṇa, but because the devotee is so advanced in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he is able to behave with Kṛṣṇa as he would with an ordinary man.

### Translation

**“ ‘When mother Yaśodā saw all the universes within Kṛṣṇa’s mouth, she was astonished for the time being. The Lord is worshiped like Indra and other demigods by the followers of the three Vedas, who offer Him sacrifices. He is worshiped as impersonal Brahman by saintly persons who understand His greatness through studying the Upaniṣads, as the Puruṣa by great philosophers who analytically study the universe, as the allpervading Supersoul by great yogīs, and as the Supreme Personality of Godhead by devotees. Nevertheless, mother Yaśodā considered the Lord her own son.’**

### Purport

This verse is quoted from *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (10.8.45). Those who are spiritually advanced forget Kṛṣṇa’s opulence by the mercy of *yogamāyā.* For instance, mother Yaśodā considered Kṛṣṇa an ordinary child.

### Translation

**“ ‘Although Kṛṣṇa is beyond sense perception and is unmanifest to human beings, He takes up the guise of a human being with a material body. Thus mother Yaśodā thought Him to be her son, and she bound Lord Kṛṣṇa with rope to a wooden mortar, as if He were an ordinary child.’**

### Purport

This verse from *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (10.9.14) is in reference to Lord Kṛṣṇa’s exhibiting Himself like an ordinary child before mother Yaśodā. He was playing like a naughty boy, stealing butter and breaking butter pots. Mother Yaśodā became disturbed and wanted to bind the Lord to a mortar used for pounding spices. In other words, she considered the Supreme Personality of Godhead an ordinary child.

### Purport

This verse is from *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (10.18.24). When all the cowherd boys were playing in the forest of Vṛndāvana, the demon Pralambāsura appeared in order to kidnap Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma. The *asura* appeared disguised in the form of a cowherd boy, but Kṛṣṇa could understand his trick. Kṛṣṇa therefore divided all the cowherd boys into two parties. One party belonged to Balarāma, and the other party belonged to Kṛṣṇa Himself. Ultimately Kṛṣṇa was defeated in this play, and according to the wager, the defeated party had to carry the victorious party on their shoulders. Kṛṣṇa had to carry Śrīdāmā on His shoulders, and Bhadrasena had to carry Vṛṣabha. The demon Pralambāsura had to carry Balarāma, and when Balarāma mounted his shoulders, the demon ran far away. Finally the demon began to expand his body to a gigantic size, and Balarāma understood that he intended to kill Him. Balarāma immediately struck the demon’s head with His strong fist, and the demon fell down dead as if he were a snake whose head had been smashed.

### Translation

**“ ‘My dearmost Kṛṣṇa, You are worshiping Me and giving up the company of all the other gopīs, who wanted to enjoy themselves with You.” Thinking like this, Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī considered Herself Kṛṣṇa’s most beloved gopī. She had become proud and had left the rāsa-līlā with Kṛṣṇa. In the deep forest She said, “My dear Kṛṣṇa, I cannot walk any more. You can take Me wherever You like.” When Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī petitioned Kṛṣṇa in this way, Kṛṣṇa said, “Just get up on My shoulders.” As soon as Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī began to do so, He disappeared. Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī then began to grieve over Her request and Kṛṣṇa’s disappearance.’**

We have come only because we are attracted by the supreme music of Your flute. But You are a great cheater, for who else would give up the company of young girls like us in the dead of night?’**

### Purport

This verse, quoted from *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (10.31.16), describes how the *gopīs* went to the forest for Kṛṣṇa’s enjoyment in the dead of night. The *gopīs* approached Kṛṣṇa to enjoy themselves with Him in the *rāsa* dance. Kṛṣṇa knew this very well, but He was superficially trying to avoid them. He is therefore addressed by the *gopīs* as *kitava,* a great cheater, because He first attracted them to come dance with Him, and yet when they actually came, neglecting the orders of their friends and relatives, He tried to avoid them by giving them so-called good instructions. These cunning instructions were too much for the *gopīs* to tolerate; they therefore had a right to address Kṛṣṇa as *kitava,* a great cheater. They were all young girls, and they had come to Him to be enjoyed. How could He avoid them? The *gopīs* therefore expressed great disappointment in this verse. They came voluntarily, but Kṛṣṇa was so cunning that He wanted to avoid their company. The *gopīs’* lamentation was certainly very appropriate, and in this way Kṛṣṇa tested their sincerity.

### Translation

**“When one is fully attached to Kṛṣṇa’s lotus feet, one attains the śamatā stage. The word ‘śamatā’ is derived from the word ‘śama’; therefore śānta-rasa, the position of neutrality, means being fully attached to the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa. This is the verdict from the mouth of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself. This state is called self-realization.**

### Translation

### Purport

This verse is from *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (11.19.36). The conditioned soul under the clutches of *māyā,* the material energy, is very much agitated by the urges of the tongue and the genitals. Control of the urges of the tongue, the belly and the genitals (which are situated in a straight line) is called *dhṛti.* Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura says, *tāra madhye jihvā ati, lobhamaya sudurmati.* Among the senses, the tongue is the most formidable enemy of the conditioned soul. Urged by the tongue, one commits many sinful activities. Although Kṛṣṇa has given human beings nice food, people still commit sins by killing poor animals for the satisfaction of the tongue. Not being able to control the tongue, the conditioned soul eats more than he needs. Of course, everyone must eat to keep the body fit for the Lord’s service, but when one cannot control the senses, he falls victim to the dictations of the tongue and the belly. Naturally, genital agitation follows, and one seeks illicit sex. However, if one is fixed at the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, he can control the tongue. Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura further states, *kṛṣṇa baḍa dayāmaya, karibāre jihvā jaya, sva-prasāda-anna dilā bhāi:* in order to conquer the tongue, Kṛṣṇa has been very merciful and has given us nice food that has been offered to Him. When a person is attached to Kṛṣṇa’s lotus feet, he does not eat anything not offered to Kṛṣṇa. *Sei annāmṛta khāo, rādhā-kṛṣṇa-guṇa gāo, preme ḍāka caitanya-nitāi.* Since a devotee eats only *prasādam,* he conquers the dictations of the tongue, belly and genitals. One can control the dictates of the senses when situated in the position of *śānta-rasa.* Then one’s advancement in Kṛṣṇa consciousness is assured.

*kṛṣṇa vinā tṛṣṇā-tyāga — tāra kārya māni  
ataeva ‘śānta’ kṛṣṇa-bhakta eka jāni*

### Synonyms

*kṛṣṇa* *vinā* — without Kṛṣṇa; *tṛṣṇā*-*tyāga* — giving up all desires; *tāra* — of *śānta-rasa*; *kārya* — the business; *māni* — I accept; *ataeva* — therefore; *śānta* — the position of equilibrium; *kṛṣṇa*-*bhakta* — a devotee of Kṛṣṇa; *eka* — only; *jāni* — I know.

### Translation

**“Giving up all desires not connected with Kṛṣṇa is the business of one who is in śānta-rasa. Only a devotee of Kṛṣṇa can be situated on that platform. He is thus called a śānta-rasa-bhakta.**

### Purport

In this position, one is freed from all material enjoyment. When one is not agitated or disturbed, he can immediately realize his relationship with Kṛṣṇa. A *śānta-rasa* devotee is therefore always fixed in realization. This instruction was given by the Lord Himself to Uddhava. The beginning of pure devotional service is called *anyābhilāṣitā-śūnya.* When one is situated on the platform of neutrality, he is freed from the material platform and fully situated in spiritual life. The word *dama,* used in verse 213, means *indriya-saṁyama* — curbing one’s senses. The word *dama* can also mean curbing one’s enemies. A king has to take steps to curb the criminal activities of his citizens. Great *rājarṣis,* devotee kings, used to control undesirable elements in their states, and this also may be called *dama.* However, *dama* here refers to the conditioned soul who must control his senses. Real *dama* means controlling the undesirable activities of the senses.

The devotee’s only desire is to be attached to the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa and to engage in His transcendental loving service.

Thus the Lord is the object of maintenance, like a son, and therefore this mellow is full of the qualities of four rasas — śānta-rasa, dāsya-rasa, fraternity and parental love. This is more transcendental nectar.**

### Purport

In his *Amṛta-pravāha-bhāṣya,* Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura gives us a short summary of this complicated description of the different *rasas.* He states that by becoming firmly fixed in the Lord’s service, one is devoid of all material desires. These are the two transcendental qualities on the *śānta-rasa* platform. Just as sound vibration is found in all the material elements, these two qualities of *śānta-rasa* are spread throughout all the other transcendental mellows, which are known as *dāsya-rasa, sakhya-rasa, vātsalya-rasa* and *madhura-rasa.* Although in *śānta-rasa* there is attachment for Kṛṣṇa in awe and veneration — since the two valuable transcendental qualities of this *rasa* are attachment for Kṛṣṇa and detachment from material desires — nonetheless the sense of intimacy is lacking. The reason for this is that in *śānta-rasa* attachment for impersonal Brahman and localized Paramātmā is prominent. In other words, the sense of intimacy by which one thinks of Kṛṣṇa as one’s only shelter and friend is absent in *śānta-rasa* because one accepts Kṛṣṇa as the impersonal Parambrahma or localized Paramātmā. This understanding is based on the speculative knowledge of the *jñānī.* However, when this knowledge is further developed, one is convinced that the Paramātmā, the Supreme Lord, is the master and that the living entity is His eternal servant. One then attains the platform of *dāsya-rasa.* In *dāsya-rasa* the Lord is accepted with awe and veneration. Thus the active service that is absent in *śānta-rasa* becomes prominent in *dāsya-rasa.* In other words, in *dāsya-rasa* the qualities of *śānta-rasa* are present, and service also becomes predominantly visible. Similarly, when this same *rasa* is developed into fraternity (*sakhya-rasa*), a friendly intimacy is added. There is no awe or veneration in *sakhya-rasa.* Therefore *sakhya-rasa* is invested with the qualities of three *rasas* — *śānta, dāsya* and *sakhya.* Similarly, on the platform of parental love, the qualities of *śānta-rasa, dāsya-rasa* and *sakhya-rasa* are fully developed in another form — the sense of maintaining the Lord. Therefore on the platform of parental love there exists a combination of the qualities of four transcendental mellows — *śānta, dāsya, sakhya* and parenthood. The mellow of parenthood puts the devotee in the position of a maintainer. Indeed, without formality the devotee takes the position of maintainer and regards the Lord as the object of maintenance. Thus on the platform of parental love the qualities of four transcendental mellows of love of Kṛṣṇa are present.
