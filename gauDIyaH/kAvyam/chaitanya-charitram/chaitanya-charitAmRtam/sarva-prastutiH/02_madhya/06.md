CHAPTER SIX

A summary of the sixth chapter is given by Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura in his *Amṛta-pravāha-bhāṣya* as follows. When Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu entered the temple of Jagannātha, He immediately fainted. Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya then took Him to his home. Meanwhile, Gopīnātha Ācārya, the brother-in-law of Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya, met Mukunda Datta and talked to him about Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s acceptance of *sannyāsa* and His journey to Jagannātha Purī. After hearing about Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s fainting and His being carried to the house of Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya, people crowded there to see the Lord. Śrīla Nityānanda Prabhu and other devotees then visited the Jagannātha temple, and when they came back to the house of Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu returned to external consciousness. Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya received everyone and distributed *mahā-prasādam* with great care. The Bhaṭṭācārya then became acquainted with Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and arranged accommodations at his aunt’s house. His brother-in-law, Gopīnātha Ācārya, established that Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu was Kṛṣṇa Himself, but Sārvabhauma and his many disciples could not accept this. However, Gopīnātha Ācārya convinced Sārvabhauma that no one can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead without being favored by Him. He proved by śāstric quotation, quotations from the revealed scriptures, that Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was Kṛṣṇa Himself in person. Still, Sārvabhauma did not take these statements very seriously. Hearing all these arguments, Caitanya Mahāprabhu told His devotees that Sārvabhauma was His spiritual master and that whatever he said out of affection was for everyone’s benefit.

When Sārvabhauma met Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, he asked Him to hear Vedānta philosophy from him. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu accepted this proposal, and for seven days He continally heard Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya explain the *Vedānta-sūtra.* However, the Lord remained very silent. Because of His silence, the Bhaṭṭācārya asked Him whether He was understanding the Vedānta philosophy, and the Lord replied, “Sir, I can understand Vedānta philosophy very clearly, but I cannot understand your explanations.” There was then a discussion between the Bhaṭṭācārya and Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu concerning the authority of the Vedic scriptures, specifically the *Upaniṣads* and *Vedānta-sūtra.* The Bhaṭṭācārya was an impersonalist, but Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu proved that the Absolute Truth is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He proved that the conceptions of the Māyāvādī philosophers concerning the impersonal Absolute Truth are incorrect.

The Absolute Truth is neither impersonal nor without power. The greatest mistake made by the Māyāvādī philosophers is in conceiving the Absolute Truth to be impersonal and without energy. In all the *Vedas,* the unlimited energies of the Absolute Truth have been accepted. It is also accepted that the Absolute Truth has His transcendental, blissful, eternal form. According to the *Vedas,* the Lord and the living entity are equal in quality but different quantitatively. The real philosophy of the Absolute Truth states that the Lord and His creation are inconceivably and simultaneously one and different. The conclusion is that the Māyāvādī philosophers are actually atheists. There was much discussion on this issue between Sārvabhauma and Caitanya Mahāprabhu, but despite all his endeavors, the Bhaṭṭācārya was defeated in the end.

At the request of Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu then explained the *ātmārāma* verse of *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* in eighteen different ways. When the Bhaṭṭācārya came to his senses, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu disclosed His real identity. The Bhaṭṭācārya then recited one hundred verses in praise of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu and offered his obeisances. After this, Gopīnātha Ācārya and all the others, having seen the wonderful potencies of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, became very joyful.

One morning after this incident, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu received some *prasādam* from Jagannātha and offered it to Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya. Without caring for formality, the Bhaṭṭācārya immediately partook of the *mahā-prasādam.* On another day, when the Bhaṭṭācārya asked Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu the best way to worship and meditate, the Lord advised him to chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra.* On another day, the Bhaṭṭācārya wanted to change the reading of the *tat te ’nukampām* verse because he did not like the word *mukti-pada.* He wanted to substitute the word *bhakti-pada.* Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu advised Sārvabhauma not to change the reading of *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,* because *mukti-pada* indicated the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Kṛṣṇa. Having become a pure devotee, the Bhaṭṭācārya said, “Because the meaning is hazy, I still prefer *bhakti-pada.*” At this, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and the other inhabitants of Jagannātha Purī became very pleased. Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya thus became a pure Vaiṣṇava, and the other learned scholars there followed him.

### Purport

The word *sūddīpta-sāttvika* is explained as follows by Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura: “The *Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu* mentions eight kinds of transcendental transformations in the bodies of advanced devotees. These are sometimes checked by the devotee, and there are two stages of such checking, technically known as *dhūmāyitā* and *jvalitā.* The *dhūmāyitā* (smoking) stage is exhibited when only one or two transformations are slightly present and it is possible to conceal them. When more than two or three transcendental transformations are manifest and it is still possible to conceal them, although with great difficulty, that stage is called *jvalitā* (lighted). When four or five symptoms are exhibited, the *dīpta* (blazing) stage has been reached. When five, six or all eight symptoms are simultaneously manifest, that position is called *uddīpta* (inflamed). And when all eight symptoms are multiplied a thousand times and are all visible at once, the devotee is in the *sūddīpta* (intensely inflamed) stage. *Nitya-siddha-bhakta* indicates the eternally liberated associates of the Lord. Such devotees enjoy the company of the Lord in four relationships — as servant, friend, parent or conjugal lover.”

### Purport

*Adhirūḍha-bhāva,* or *adhirūḍha-mahābhāva,* is explained in the *Ujjvala-nīlamaṇi* of Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī. Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura quotes Rūpa Gosvāmī as follows: “The loving propensity of the *āśraya* (devotee) toward the *viṣaya* (Lord) becomes so ecstatic that even after enjoying the company of the beloved, the devotee feels that his enjoyment is insufficient. At such a time, the lover sees the beloved in different ways. Such a development of ecstasy is called *anurāga.* When *anurāga* reaches its highest limit and becomes perceivable in the body, it is called *bhāva.* When the bodily symptoms are not very distinct, however, the emotional state is still called *anurāga,* not *bhāva.* When *bhāva* ecstasy is intensified, it is called *mahā-bhāva.* The symptoms of *mahā-bhāva* are visible only in the bodies of eternal associates like the *gopīs.*”

Vaiṣṇava *sannyāsīs* never think of themselves as being one with the Lord; they always consider themselves eternal servants of Kṛṣṇa, and they want to see everyone in the world become Kṛṣṇa conscious. For this reason, a Vaiṣṇava *sannyāsī* always offers his blessings to everyone, saying *kṛṣṇe matir astu* (“May you become Kṛṣṇa conscious”).

Thus the Bhaṭṭācārya certainly accepted Him as his master.

The Lord took *sannyāsa* from Keśava Bhāratī in the Bhāratī *sampradāya,* in which the *brahmacārīs* (the assistants of the *sannyāsīs*) are named “Caitanya.” Even after accepting *sannyāsa,* Caitanya Mahāprabhu retained the name “Caitanya,” meaning a humble servant of a *sannyāsī.* Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya appreciated this very much.

### Translation

**Gopīnātha Ācārya replied, “Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya Mahāprabhu does not rely on any external formality. There is no need for Him to accept the sannyāsa order from a superior sampradāya.”**

### Purport

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu accepted *sannyāsa* from the Bhāratī *sampradāya* (community), which belongs to the disciplic succession of Śaṅkarācārya. Śaṅkarācārya introduced names for his *sannyāsa* disciples, and these are ten in number. Out of these, the surnames Tīrtha, Āśrama and Sarasvatī are considered topmost. In the monastery at Śṛṅgerī, the surname Sarasvatī is considered first class, Bhāratī second class and Purī third class. A *sannyāsī* who has very nicely understood the slogan *tat tvam asi* and who takes his bath at the confluence of the rivers Ganges, Yamunā and Sarasvatī is called a Tīrtha. A person who is very eager to accept *sannyāsa,* who is detached from worldly activities, who has no desire for any kind of material facilities, and who is thus saved from repeated birth and death is known as Āśrama. When a *sannyāsī* lives in a beautiful, solitary place in the forest and is freed from all material desires, he is called Vana. A *sannyāsī* who always lives in the forest and renounces all connection with the world in order to be elevated to the heavenly planets, where he can live in the Nandana-kānana*,* is called Araṇya. One who prefers living in the mountains engaging in the study of the *Bhagavad-gītā* and whose intelligence is fixed is called Giri. One who prefers living in great mountains, even among ferocious animals, to attain the summit of philosophical speculation (understanding that the essence of this material world is useless) is called Parvata. A *sannyāsī* who has dipped into the ocean of the Absolute Truth and collected some valuable stones of knowledge from that ocean, who never falls from the regulative principles of a *sannyāsī,* is called Sāgara. One who has learned the classical art of music, who engages in its culture, and who has become expert and completely aloof from material attachment is called Sarasvatī. Sarasvatī is the goddess of music and learning, and in one hand she holds a musical instrument called a *vīṇā.* A *sannyāsī* who is always engaged in music for spiritual elevation is called Sarasvatī. One who has become completely educated and is freed from all kinds of ignorance and who is never unhappy, even in a distressed condition, is called Bhāratī. One who has become very expert in absolute knowledge, who is situated in the Absolute Truth, and who always discusses the Absolute Truth is called Purī.

All these *sannyāsīs* are assisted by *brahmacārīs,* who are described as follows: One who knows his real identity and is fixed in his particular occupational duty, who is always happy in spiritual understanding, is called Svarūpa-brahmacārī. One who completely knows the Brahman effulgence and is always engaged in the practice of *yoga* is called Prakāśa-brahmacārī. One who has acquired absolute knowledge and who always meditates on the Absolute Truth, knowledge, the unlimited and the Brahman effulgence, thus keeping himself in transcendental bliss, is called Ānanda-brahmacārī. One who is able to distinguish between matter and spirit, who is never disturbed by material transformations, and who meditates on the unlimited, inexhaustible, auspicious Brahman effulgence is a first-class, learned *brahmacārī* and is named Caitanya.

When Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya was talking with Gopīnātha Ācārya about Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s *sannyāsa* community, he appreciated the first name, “Śrī Kṛṣṇa,” but did not like the surname, “Caitanya,” which is the name for a *brahmacārī* belonging to the Bhāratī community. He therefore suggested that the Lord be elevated to the Sarasvatī community. However, Gopīnātha Ācārya pointed out that the Lord does not depend on any external formality. Gopīnātha Ācārya was firmly convinced that Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was Kṛṣṇa Himself and therefore independent of any external ritual or formality. If one wants to engage in pure devotional service, he does not require titular superiority as a Bhāratī or a Sarasvatī.

### Synonyms

*nirantara* — continually; *iṅhāke* — to Him; *vedānta* — Vedānta philosophy; *śunāiba* — I shall recite; *vairāgya* — of renunciation; *advaita* — of monism; *mārge* — on the path; *praveśa* — entrance; *karāiba* — I shall cause Him to make.

### Translation

**“I shall continually recite Vedānta philosophy before Caitanya Mahāprabhu so that He may remain fixed in His renunciation and thus enter upon the path of monism.”**

### Purport

According to Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya, among *sannyāsīs* the cultivation of Vedānta philosophy helps in becoming detached from sense gratification. Thus a *sannyāsī* can protect the prestige of wearing a loincloth (*kaupīna*). One has to practice sense control as well as mind control and subdue the six forces of speech, mind, anger, tongue, belly and genitals. Then one can become expert in understanding the devotional service of the Lord and thus become a perfect *sannyāsī.* For that purpose one must cultivate knowledge and renunciation regularly. When one is attached to material sense gratification, he cannot protect his *sannyāsa* order. Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya suggested that by the study of *vairāgya* (renunciation) Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu might be saved from the clutches of full-fledged youthful desires.

### Translation

**Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya then suggested, “If Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu would like, I could bring Him into a first-class sampradāya by offering Him saffron cloth and performing the reformatory process again.”**

### Purport

The Bhaṭṭācārya wanted to reinstate Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu into the Sarasvatī *sampradāya* because he did not like the Lord’s belonging to the Bhāratī *sampradāya* or Purī *sampradāya.* Actually, he did not know the position of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. As the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Caitanya Mahāprabhu did not depend on an inferior or superior *sampradāya.* The Supreme Personality of Godhead remains in the supreme position in all circumstances.

### Verse text

*‘bhaṭṭācārya’ tumi iṅhāra nā jāna mahimā  
bhagavattā-lakṣaṇera iṅhātei sīmā*

### Synonyms

*bhaṭṭācārya* — my dear Bhaṭṭācārya; *tumi* — you; *iṅhāra* — of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu; *nā* — not; *jāna* — know; *mahimā* — the greatness; *bhagavattā* — of being the Supreme Personality of Godhead; *lakṣaṇera* — of symptoms; *iṅhātei* — in Him; *sīmā* — the highest degree.

### Translation

**“My dear Bhaṭṭācārya, you do not know the greatness of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. All the symptoms of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are found in Him to the highest degree.”**

### Purport

Since the Bhaṭṭācārya was an impersonalist, he had no idea of the Absolute Truth beyond the impersonal effulgence. However, Gopīnātha Ācārya informed him that Caitanya Mahāprabhu was the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Those who know the Absolute Truth know it in three phases, as explained in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (1.2.11):

*vadanti tat tattva-vidas* *tattvaṁ yaj jñānam advayam  
brahmeti paramātmeti* *bhagavān iti śabdyate*

“Those who are in knowledge of the nondual Absolute Truth know very clearly what is Brahman, what is Paramātmā, and what is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.” The Supreme Personality of Godhead is *ṣaḍ-aiśvarya-pūrṇa,* complete with six opulences. Gopīnātha Ācārya emphasized that all those six opulences were completely existing in Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

*śiṣya-gaṇa kahe, — ‘īśvara kaha kon pramāṇe’  
ācārya kahe, — ‘vijña-mata īśvara-lakṣaṇe’*

### Synonyms

*śiṣya*-*gaṇa* *kahe* — the disciples of Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya said; *īśvara* *kaha* — you say the Supreme Personality of Godhead; *kon* *pramāṇe* — by what evidence; *ācārya* *kahe* — Gopīnātha Ācārya replied; *vijña*-*mata* — statements of authorized persons; *īśvara*-*lakṣaṇe* — in understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

### Translation

**The disciples of Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya retaliated, “By what evidence do you conclude that Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is the Supreme Lord?”**

### Purport

**Gopīnātha Ācārya replied, “The statements of authorized ācāryas who understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead are proof.”**

Since the appearance of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, there have been many pseudo incarnations in India who do not present authorized evidence. Five hundred years ago the disciples of Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya, being very learned scholars, were certainly right in asking Gopīnātha Ācārya for evidence. If a person proposes that he himself is God or that someone else is an incarnation of God or God Himself, he must cite evidence from *śāstra* to prove his claim. Thus the request of the Bhaṭṭācārya’s disciples is quite bona fide. Unfortunately, at the present moment it has become fashionable to present someone as an incarnation of God without referring to the *śāstras.* Before an intelligent person accepts someone as an incarnation of God, however, he must ask about the evidence. When the disciples of Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya challenged Gopīnātha Ācārya, he immediately replied correctly: “We must hear the statements of great personalities in order to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead.” Lord Kṛṣṇa is established as the Supreme Personality of Godhead by statements from many authorized persons, such as Brahmā, Nārada, Vyāsadeva, Asita and Arjuna. Similarly, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is also established as the Supreme Personality of Godhead by evidence from the same personalities. This will be explained later.

### Translation

**The disciples of the Bhaṭṭācārya said, “We derive knowledge of the Absolute Truth by logical hypothesis.”**

### Purport

**Gopīnātha Ācārya replied, “One cannot attain real knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead by such logical hypothesis and argument.”**

The Māyāvādī philosophers in particular make certain hypotheses about the Absolute Truth. They reason that in the material world we experience that everything is created. If we trace the history of anything, we find a creator. Therefore there must be a creator of this huge cosmic manifestation. By such reasoning they come to the conclusion that a higher power has created this cosmic manifestation. The Māyāvādīs do not accept this great power to be a person. Their brains cannot accommodate the fact that the huge cosmic manifestation can be created by a person. They doubt this because as soon as they think of a person, they think of a person within the material world with limited potency. Sometimes the Māyāvādī philosophers will accept Lord Kṛṣṇa or Lord Rāma as Bhagavān, but they think of the Lord as a person having a material body. The Māyāvādīs do not understand that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, has a spiritual body. They think of Kṛṣṇa as a great personality, a human being, within whom there is the supreme impersonal power, Brahman. Therefore they finally conclude that the impersonal Brahman is the Supreme, not the personality Kṛṣṇa. This is the basis of Māyāvādī philosophy. However, from the *śāstras* we can understand that the Brahman effulgence consists of the bodily rays of Kṛṣṇa:

*yasya prabhā prabhavato jagad-aṇḍa-koṭi- *
 *koṭiṣv aśeṣa-vasudhādi-vibhūti-bhinnam  
tad brahma niṣkalam anantam aśeṣa-bhūtaṁ *
 *govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi*

“I serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda, the primeval Lord, the effulgence of whose transcendental body is known as the *brahmajyoti.* That *brahmajyoti,* which is unlimited, unfathomed and all-pervasive, is the cause of the creation of unlimited numbers of planets with varieties of climates and specific conditions of life.” (*Brahma-saṁhitā* 5.40)

Māyāvādī philosophers study the Vedic literature, but they do not understand that in the last stage of realization the Absolute Truth is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa. They do accept the fact that there is a creator of this cosmic manifestation, but that is *anumāna* (hypothesis). The Māyāvādī philosophers’ logic is something like seeing smoke on a hill and concluding that there is a fire. When there is a forest fire on a high hill, smoke is first of all visible. Since it is known that smoke is created when there is fire, from seeing the smoke on the hill one can conclude that a fire is burning there. Similarly, from seeing this cosmic manifestation the Māyāvādī philosophers conclude that there must be a creator.

The disciples of Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya wanted evidence to show that Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was actually the creator of the cosmic manifestation. Only then would they accept Him as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the original cause of creation. Gopīnātha Ācārya replied that one could not understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead by guesswork. As Kṛṣṇa says in the *Bhagavad- gītā*(7.25):

*nāhaṁ prakāśaḥ sarvasya* *yoga-māyā-samāvṛtaḥ  
mūḍho ’yaṁ nābhijānāti* *loko mām ajam avyayam*

“I am never manifest to the foolish and unintelligent. For them I am covered by My eternal creative potency \*yogamāyā*\]; and so the deluded world knows Me not, who am unborn and infallible.” The Supreme Personality of Godhead reserves the right of not being exposed to nondevotees. He can only be understood by bona fide devotees. Lord Kṛṣṇa says elsewhere in the [*Bhagavad-gītā* (18.55), *bhaktyā mām abhijānāti:* “One can understand Me only by the devotional process.” In the fourth chapter of the *Bhagavad-gītā* (4.3) Lord Kṛṣṇa says, *bhakto ’si me sakhā ceti rahasyaṁ hy etad uttamam.* Here Lord Kṛṣṇa informs Arjuna that He is disclosing the secrets of the *Bhagavad-gītā* to him because he is His devotee. Arjuna was not a *sannyāsī,* nor was he a Vedāntist or *brāhmaṇa.* He was, however, a devotee of Kṛṣṇa. The conclusion is that we have to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead from the devotees. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu Himself says, *guru-kṛṣṇa-prasāde pāya bhakti-latā-bīja.* (Cc. *Madhya* 19.151)

More evidence can be cited to show that without the mercy of a devotee or the mercy of Kṛṣṇa, one cannot understand what is Kṛṣṇa and what is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is confirmed in the next verse.

*anumāna* *pramāṇa* — evidence by hypothesis; *nahe* — there is not; *īśvara*-*tattva*-*jñāne* — in understanding the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead; *kṛpā* *vinā* — without His mercy; *īśvarere* — the Supreme Personality of Godhead; *keha* — anyone; *nāhi* — not; *jāne* — knows.

### Translation

**Gopīnātha Ācārya continued, “One can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead only by His mercy, not by guesswork or hypothesis.”**

### Purport

One cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead simply by exhibiting some mundane magic. Foolish people are enchanted by magical demonstrations, and when they see a few wonderful things done by mystical power, they accept a magician as the Personality of Godhead or an incarnation. This is not the way of realization. Nor should one guess or speculate about an incarnation of God or the Personality of Godhead. One has to learn from the bona fide person or from the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself, as Arjuna did, by the mercy of Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa Himself also gives many hints about His potencies as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One should understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead only through the evidence presented by the *śāstras* and the *mahājanas.* In any case, one must have the mercy of the Lord in order to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead by devotional service.

### Purport

The above verse is from *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (10.14.29). The *Brahma-saṁhitā* states, *vedeṣu durlabham adurlabham ātma-bhaktau* (Bs. 5.33). Although the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, is the ultimate goal of knowledge (*vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyaḥ*), one who is not a pure devotee and who is not engaged in the service of the Lord cannot understand Him. Lord Brahmā therefore confirms this. *Vedeṣu durlabham:* “It is very difficult to understand the Supreme Lord simply through one’s studies.” *Adurlabham ātma-bhaktau:* “However, it is very easy for the devotees to capture the Lord.” The Lord is known as *ajita* (unconquerable). No one can conquer the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but the Lord consents to be conquered by His devotees. That is His nature. As stated in the *Padma Purāṇa:*

*ataḥ śrī-kṛṣṇa-nāmādi* *na bhaved grahyam indriyaiḥ  
sevonmukhe hi jihvādau* *svayam eva sphuraty adaḥ*

Being pleased by devotional activities, the Lord reveals Himself to His devotees. That is the way to understand Him.

The verse from *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* quoted by Gopīnātha Ācārya was originally spoken by Lord Brahmā when he was defeated by Lord Kṛṣṇa. Lord Brahmā had stolen all the calves and cowherd boys in order to test Kṛṣṇa’s power. Lord Brahmā admitted that his own extraordinary powers within the universe were not in the least comparable to the unlimited powers of Lord Kṛṣṇa. If Lord Brahmā can make a mistake in understanding Kṛṣṇa, what to speak of ordinary persons, who either misunderstand Kṛṣṇa or falsely present a so-called incarnation of Kṛṣṇa for their own sense gratification.

### Translation

**“It is not your fault; it is the verdict of the scriptures. You cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead simply by scholarship.”**

### Purport

This is a very important verse. Even big scholars cannot understand Kṛṣṇa, yet they dare comment on the *Bhagavad-gītā.* Reading the *Bhagavad-gītā* means understanding Kṛṣṇa, yet we actually see many scholars making blunders in trying to understand Kṛṣṇa. Gopīnātha Ācārya’s statement is confirmed in many places in the Vedic literature. In the *Kaṭha Upaniṣad* (1.2.23) it is stated:

*nāyam ātmā pravacanena labhyo *
 *na medhayā na bahunā śrutena  
yam evaiṣa vṛṇute tena labhyas *
 *tasyaiṣa ātmā vivṛṇute tanūṁ svām*

It is also stated in *Kaṭha Upaniṣad* (1.2.9):

*naiṣā tarkeṇa matir āpaneyā *
 *proktānyenaiva sujñānāya preṣṭha  
yāṁ tvam āpaḥ satya-dhṛtir batāsi *
 *tvādṛṅ no bhūyān naciketaḥ praṣṭā*

The fact is that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Supersoul, cannot be attained simply by explanations, logic and erudite scholarship. One cannot understand Him simply by one’s brain substance. Even by studying all the Vedic literatures, one cannot understand the Supreme Lord. However, if one is slightly favored by the mercy of the Lord, if the Lord is pleased, one can understand Him. But who are the candidates eligible to receive the mercy of the Lord? Only the devotees. They alone can understand what is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord reveals Himself to the sincere devotee when He is pleased with his service: *svayam eva sphuraty adaḥ.* One should not try to understand the Lord simply from the statements of the *Vedas,* nor should one uselessly attempt to decry these statements through reasoning and logic.

### Translation

**Gopīnātha Ācārya replied, “Knowledge of the summum bonum, the Absolute Truth, is evidence of the mercy of the Supreme Lord.”**

### Purport

Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya informed his brother-in-law, Gopīnātha Ācārya, “The Supreme Personality of Godhead may not have shown mercy to me, but what is the proof of His having shown it to you? Kindly let us know about this.” In reply to this, Gopīnātha Ācārya said that the *summum bonum,* the Absolute Truth, and His different potencies are identical. Therefore one can understand the substance of the Absolute Truth by the manifestation of His different potencies. The *summum bonum* includes all potencies in one unit. The Absolute Truth combined with different characteristics is the original substance (*vastu*): *parāsya śaktir vividhaiva śrūyate.*

Thus the *Vedas* state that the Absolute Truth has different potencies. When one understands the characteristics of the potencies of the Absolute Truth, one is aware of the Absolute Truth. On the material platform as well, one can understand the substance by the manifestation of its symptoms. For example, when there is heat, it is to be understood that there is fire. The heat of the fire is perceived directly. The fire may not be visible, but one can search out the fire by feeling heat. Similarly, if one can perceive the characteristics of the Absolute Truth, we can know that he has understood the substance of the Absolute Truth by the mercy of the Lord.

In the *Bhagavad-gītā* (7.25) it is said, *nāhaṁ prakāśaḥ sarvasya:* the Supreme Personality of Godhead reserves the right of not being exposed to everyone. *Sevonmukhe hi jihvādau svayam eva sphuraty adaḥ:* “The Lord reveals Himself to a devotee when He is completely satisfied by the devotee’s service.” Thus one cannot understand the Supreme Lord without His mercy. The Absolute Truth cannot be understood by speculation, and this is the conclusion of the *Bhagavad-gītā.*

### Purport

When one’s heart is not cleansed, one cannot awaken the transcendental nature of devotional service. As Lord Kṛṣṇa confirms in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (7.28):

*yeṣāṁ tv anta-gataṁ pāpaṁ* *janānāṁ puṇya-karmaṇām  
te dvandva-moha-nirmuktā* *bhajante māṁ dṛḍha-vratāḥ*

“Persons who have acted piously in previous lives and in this life and whose sinful actions are completely eradicated are freed from the dualities of delusion, and they engage themselves in My service with determination.”

When one is actually engaged in pure devotional service, it is understood that he has already attained freedom from all reactions to sinful activities. In other words, it is to be understood that devotees are already freed from sin. A sinful person, a miscreant (*duṣkṛtī*), cannot engage in devotional service. Nor can one engage in devotional service simply on the basis of scholarly speculation. One has to wait for the mercy of the Lord in order to render pure devotional service.

### Translation

**“Another name for Lord Viṣṇu is Triyuga because there is no incarnation of Lord Viṣṇu in Kali-yuga. Indeed, this is the verdict of the revealed scriptures.”**

### Purport

The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Viṣṇu, is known as Triyuga, which means that He is manifest in three *yugas.* However, this means that in the Age of Kali the Lord appears not directly but in disguise. This is confirmed in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (7.9.38):

*itthaṁ nṛ-tiryag-ṛṣi-deva-jhaṣāvatārair *
 *lokān vibhāvayasi haṁsi jagat-pratīpān  
dharmaṁ mahā-puruṣa pāsi yugānuvṛttaṁ *
 *channaḥ kalau yad abhavas tri-yugo ’tha sa tvam*

“My Lord, You kill all the enemies of the world in Your multifarious incarnations in the families of men, animals, demigods, *ṛṣis,* aquatics and so on. Thus You illuminate the worlds with transcendental knowledge. In the Age of Kali, O Mahāpuruṣa, You sometimes appear in a covered incarnation. Therefore You are known as Triyuga \[one who appears in only three *yugas*\].”

Śrīla Śrīdhara Svāmī has also verified that Lord Viṣṇu appears in the Age of Kali but does not act as He does in other ages. Lord Viṣṇu incarnates for two purposes: *paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ vināśāya ca duṣkṛtām.* That is, He comes to engage in pastimes with His devotees and to annihilate the demons. These purposes are visible in the Satya, Tretā and Dvāpara *yugas,* but in Kali-yuga the Lord appears disguised. He does not directly kill demons and give protection to the faithful. Because the Lord is not directly perceived in Kali-yuga but is directly known in the other three *yugas,* His name is Triyuga.

### Synonyms

### Translation

**“In this Age of Kali there is no līlā-avatāra of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; therefore He is known as Triyuga. That is one of His holy names.”**

### Purport

A *līlā-avatāra* is an incarnation of the Lord who performs a variety of activities without making any special endeavor. He always has one pastime after another, all full of transcendental pleasure, and these pastimes are fully controlled by the Supreme Person. The Supreme Person is totally independent of all others in these pastimes. While teaching Sanātana Gosvāmī (Cc. *Madhya* 20.296-298), Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu pointed out that one cannot count the number of *līlā-avatāras:*

*līlāvatāra kṛṣṇera nā yāya gaṇana  
pradhāna kariyā kahi dig-daraśana*

“However,” the Lord told Sanātana, “I shall explain the chief *līlā-avatāras.*”

*matsya, kūrma, raghunātha, nṛsiṁha, vāmana  
varāhādi — lekhā yāṅra nā yāya gaṇana*

Thus the Lord’s incarnations were enumerated, including Matsya, the fish incarnation; Kūrma, the tortoise; Lord Rāmacandra; Nṛsiṁhadeva; Vāmanadeva; and Varāha, the boar incarnation. Thus there are innumerable *līlā-avatāras,* and all of these exhibit wonderful pastimes. Lord Varāha, the boar incarnation, lifted the entire planet earth from the depths of the Garbhodaka Ocean. The tortoise incarnation, Lord Kūrma, became a pivot for the emulsification of the whole sea, and Lord Nṛsiṁhadeva appeared as half-man, half-lion. These are some of the wonderful and uncommon features of *līlā-avatāras.*

In his book *Laghu-bhāgavatāmṛta,* Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī has enumerated the following twenty-five *līlā-avatāras:* Catuḥ-sana, Nārada, Varāha, Matsya, Yajña, Nara-Nārāyaṇa, Kapila, Dattātreya, Hayaśīrṣa (Hayagrīva), Haṁsa, Pṛśnigarbha, Ṛṣabha, Pṛthu, Nṛsiṁha, Kūrma, Dhanvantari, Mohinī, Vāmana, Paraśurāma, Rāghavendra, Vyāsa, Balarāma, Kṛṣṇa, Buddha and Kalki.

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is not mentioned as a *līlā-avatāra* because He is an incarnation in disguise (*channa-avatāra*)*.* In this Age of Kali there are no *līlā-avatāras,* but there is an incarnation of the Lord manifested in the body of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. This has been explained in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.*

### Translation

**“ ‘In the past, your son has had bodies of three different colors, according to the age. These colors were white, red and yellow. In this age \[Dvāpara-yuga\] He has accepted a blackish body.’**

### Purport

This verse from *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (10.8.13) was spoken by Garga Muni when he was performing the rituals at Lord Kṛṣṇa’s name-giving ceremony. He states that the incarnations of the Lord in other ages had been white, red and yellow. This yellow color refers to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, whose bodily complexion was yellowish. This confirms that in past Kali-yugas the Lord also had incarnated in a body that was yellow in hue. It is understood that the Lord incarnates in different colors for the different *yugas* (Satya, Tretā, Dvāpara and Kali). Accepting the color yellow (*pīta*), as well as other characteristics, the Lord incarnated as Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. This is the verdict of all Vedic authorities.

### Translation

**“ ‘In almost all cases, whatever learned brāhmaṇas speak becomes accepted; nothing is impossible for one who takes shelter of My illusory energy and speaks under her influence.’ ”**

### Purport

In this verse from *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (11.22.4), the Supreme Personality of Godhead explains that His illusory energy can perform the impossible; such is the power of the illusory energy. In many cases philosophical speculators have covered the real truth and have boldly set forth false theories. In ancient times philosophers like Kapila, Gautama, Jaimini, Kaṇāda and similar *brāhmaṇas* propounded useless philosophical theories, and in modern days so-called scientists are setting forth many false theories about the creation, backed up by seemingly logical arguments. This is all due to the influence of the Supreme Lord’s illusory energy. The illusory energy, therefore, sometimes appears correct because it is emanating from the Supreme Correct. To avoid the very bewildering illusory influence, one must accept the words of the Supreme Personality of Godhead as they are. Only then can one escape the influence of the illusory energy.

The *Vedānta-* or *Brahma-sūtra,* written by Śrīla Vyāsadeva, is a book studied by all advanced spiritual students, especially by the *sannyāsīs* of all religious communities (*sampradāyas*)*.* The *sannyāsīs* must read the *Vedānta-sūtra* to establish their final conclusions concerning Vedic knowledge. Here, of course, the *Vedānta* mentioned is the commentary of Śaṅkarācārya, known as *Śārīraka-bhāṣya.* Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya intended to convert Caitanya Mahāprabhu, who was a Vaiṣṇava *sannyāsī,* into a Māyāvādī *sannyāsī.* He therefore made this arrangement to instruct Him in the *Vedānta-sūtra* according to the *Śārīraka* commentary of Śaṅkarācārya. All the *sannyāsīs* of the Śaṅkara-sampradāya enjoy seriously studying the *Vedānta-sūtra* with the *Śārīraka-bhāṣya* commentary. It is said, *vedānta-vākyeṣu sadā ramantaḥ:* “One should always enjoy the studies of the *Vedānta-sūtra.*”

### Translation

**“Only for the sake of executing the duties of the renounced order of sannyāsa do I listen. Unfortunately, I cannot in the least understand the meaning you are presenting.”**

### Purport

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu presented Himself as if He were a *sannyāsī* in name only or, in other words, a number-one fool. Māyāvādī *sannyāsīs* in India are very much accustomed to declaring themselves *jagad-gurus,* teachers of the world, although they have no information of the outside world and are limited in their experience to a small town or village, or perhaps to the country of India. Nor do such *sannyāsīs* have sufficient education. Unfortunately, at the present moment there are many foolish *sannyāsīs,* both in India and elsewhere, who simply read and study Vedic literature without understanding the purports. When Caitanya Mahāprabhu was having His discussion with the Chand Kazi, the Muslim magistrate of Navadvīpa, He recited a verse from the Vedic literature to the effect that the order of *sannyāsa* is prohibited in this Age of Kali. Only those who are very serious and who follow the regulative principles and study Vedic literature should accept *sannyāsa.* Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu approved of a *sannyāsī’s* reading the *Vedānta-sūtra,* or *Brahma-sūtra,* but He did not approve the *Śārīraka* commentary of Śaṅkarācārya. Indeed, He said elsewhere, *māyāvādi-bhāṣya śunile haya sarva-nāśa:* “If one hears the *Śārīraka-bhāṣya* of Śaṅkarācārya, he is doomed.” Thus a *sannyāsī,* a transcendentalist, must read the *Vedānta-sūtra* regularly, but he should not read the *Śārīraka-bhāṣya.* This is the conclusion of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. The real commentary on the *Vedānta-sūtra* is *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. Artho ’yaṁ brahma-sūtrānām: Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* is the original commentary on the *Vedānta-sūtra,* written by the author himself, Śrīla Vyāsadeva.

### Translation

**“You do not explain the direct meaning of the Brahma-sūtras. Indeed, it appears that your business is to cover their real meaning.”**

### Purport

This is typical of all Māyāvādīs or atheists who interpret the meaning of Vedic literature in their own imaginative way. The real purpose of such foolish people is to impose the impersonalist conclusion on all Vedic literature. The Māyāvādī atheists also interpret the *Bhagavad-gītā.* In every verse of *Śrīmad Bhagavad-gītā* it is clearly stated that Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In every verse Vyāsadeva says, *śrī-bhagavān uvāca,* “the Supreme Personality of Godhead said,” or “the Blessed Lord said.” It is clearly stated that the Blessed Lord is the Supreme Person, but Māyāvādī atheists still try to prove that the Absolute Truth is impersonal. In order to present their false, imaginary meanings, they must adopt so much word jugglery and grammatical interpretation that they finally become ludicrous. Therefore Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu remarked that no one should hear the Māyāvādī commentaries or purports to any Vedic literature.

### Translation

**“Although there is other evidence, the evidence given in the Vedic version must be taken as foremost. Vedic versions understood directly are first-class evidence.”**

### Purport

Works that should be consulted are Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī’s *Tattva-sandarbha* (10-11), Śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa’s commentary on that, and the following verses of the *Brahma-sūtra: śāstra-yonitvāt* (Vs. 1.1.3), *tarkāpratiṣṭhānāt* (Vs. 2.1.11) and *śrutes tu śabda-mūlatvāt* (Vs. 2.1.27), as commented upon by Śrī Rāmānujācārya, Śrī Madhvācārya, Śrī Nimbārkācārya and Śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa. In his book *Sarva-saṁvādinī,* Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī has noted that although there are ten kinds of evidence — direct perception, the Vedic version, historical reference, hypothesis and so on — and although they are all generally accepted as evidence, the person presenting a hypothesis, reading the Vedic version, perceiving or interpreting by his experience is certain to be imperfect in four ways. That is, he is subject to committing mistakes, to becoming illusioned, to cheating and to having imperfect senses. Although the evidence may be correct, the person himself is in danger of being misled due to his material defects. Apart from the direct presentation, there is a chance that an interpretation may not be perfect. Therefore the conclusion is that only a direct presentation can be considered evidence. An interpretation cannot be accepted as evidence, but may be considered proof of evidence.

In the *Bhagavad-gītā,* at the very beginning it is stated:

*dhṛtarāṣṭra uvāca  
dharma-kṣetre kuru-kṣetre* *samavetā yuyutsavaḥ  
māmakāḥ pāṇḍavāś caiva* *kim akurvata sañjaya*

The statements of the *Bhagavad-gītā* are themselves proof that there is a place of religious pilgrimage named Kurukṣetra where the Pāṇḍavas and Kurus met to fight. After meeting there, what did they do? This was Dhṛtarāṣṭra’s inquiry to Sañjaya. Although these statements are very clear, atheists try to interpret different meanings of the words *dharma-kṣetra* and *kuru-kṣetra.* Therefore Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī has warned us not to depend on any kind of interpretation. It is better to take the verses as they are, without interpretation.

According to Vedic principles, bones and dung are generally considered very impure. If one touches a bone or stool, he must take a bath immediately. That is the Vedic injunction. Yet the *Vedas* also enjoin that a conchshell, although the bone of an animal, and cow dung, although the stool of an animal, are very much sanctified. Even though such statements appear contradictory, on the basis of the Vedic version we still accept the fact that conchshells and cow dung are pure and sanctified.

### Translation

**“The Vedic statements are self-evident. Whatever is stated there must be accepted. If we interpret according to our own imagination, the authority of the Vedas is immediately lost.”**

### Purport

Out of four main types of evidence — direct perception, hypothesis, historical reference and the *Vedas* — Vedic evidence is accepted as the foremost. If we want to interpret the Vedic version, we must imagine an interpretation according to what we want to do. First of all, we set forth such an interpretation as a suggestion or hypothesis. As such, it is not actually true, and the self-evident proof is lost.

Śrīla Madhvācārya, commenting on the aphorism *dṛśyate tu* (*Vedānta-sūtra* 2.1.6), quotes the *Bhaviṣya Purāṇa* as follows:

*ṛg-yajuḥ-sāmātharvāś ca* *bhārataṁ pañcarātrakam  
mūla-rāmāyaṇaṁ caiva* *veda ity eva śabditāḥ*

*purāṇāni ca yānīha* *vaiṣṇavāni vido viduḥ  
svataḥ-prāmāṇyam eteṣāṁ* *nātra kiñcid vicāryate*

The *Ṛg Veda, Yajur Veda, Sāma Veda, Atharva Veda, Mahābhārata, Pañcarātra* and original *Rāmāyaṇa* are all considered Vedic literature. The *Purāṇas* that are especially meant for Vaiṣṇavas (such as the *Brahma-vaivarta Purāṇa, Nāradīya Purāṇa, Viṣṇu Purāṇa* and *Bhāgavata Purāṇa*) are also Vedic literature. Therefore, whatever is stated in such *Purāṇas* or in the *Mahābhārata* and *Rāmāyaṇa* is self-evident. There is no need for interpretation. The *Bhagavad-gītā* is also within the *Mahābhārata;* therefore all the statements of the *Bhagavad-gītā* are self-evident. There is no need for interpretation, and if we do interpret, the entire authority of the Vedic literature is lost.

### Synonyms

*veda*-*purāṇe* — in the *Vedas* and the *Purāṇas*; *kahe* — it is stated; *brahma*-*nirūpaṇa* — explaining the Supreme; *sei* *brahma* — that Supreme; *bṛhat*-*vastu* — the greatest; *īśvara*-*lakṣaṇa* — feature of the Supreme Personality.

**“All the Vedas and literature that strictly follows the Vedic principles explain that the Supreme Brahman is the Absolute Truth, the greatest of all, and a feature of the Supreme Lord.**

### Purport

The greatest of everything is Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Lord Kṛṣṇa states in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (15.15), *vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyaḥ:* “By all the *Vedas,* I am to be known.” In *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (1.2.11) it is said that the Absolute Truth is understood in three phases — namely, Brahman, Paramātmā and Bhagavān, the Supreme Personality of Godhead (*brahmeti paramātmeti bhagavān iti śabdyate*)*.* Thus the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the last word in understanding the Absolute Truth, Brahman.

### Synonyms

*sarva*-*aiśvarya*-*paripūrṇa* — full with all opulences; *svayam* — personally; *bhagavān* — the Supreme Personality of Godhead; *tāṅre* — Him; *nirākāra* — impersonal; *kari’* — making; *karaha* — you make; *vyākhyāna* — explanation,.

### Translation

**“Actually, the Supreme Absolute Truth is a person, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, full with all opulences. You are trying to explain Him as impersonal and formless.**

### Purport

Brahman means *bṛhattva,* the greatest of all. The greatest of all is Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He possesses all potencies and opulence in full; therefore the Absolute Truth, the greatest of all, is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Whether one says “Brahman” or “the Supreme Personality of Godhead,” the fact is the same, for they are identical. In the *Bhagavad-gītā,* Arjuna accepted Kṛṣṇa as *paraṁ brahma paraṁ dhāma.* Although the living entities or material nature are sometimes described as Brahman, Parabrahman — the Supreme, the greatest of all Brahmans — is still Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is full with all opulences, and as such He possesses all riches, all strength, all reputation, all knowledge, all beauty and all renunciation. He is eternally a person and eternally supreme. If one tries to explain the Supreme impersonally, one distorts the real meaning of Brahman.

*‘nirviśeṣa’ tāṅre kahe yei śruti-gaṇa  
‘prākṛta’ niṣedhi kare ‘aprākṛta’ sthāpana*

### Synonyms

*nirviśeṣa* — impersonal; *tāṅre* — Him; *kahe* — say; *yei* — whatever; *śruti*-*gaṇa* — the *Vedas*; *prākṛta* — mundane; *niṣedhi* — forbidding; *kare* — does; *aprākṛta* — transcendental; *sthāpana* — confirmation.

### Translation

**“Wherever there is an impersonal description in the Vedas, the Vedas mean to establish that everything belonging to the Supreme Personality of Godhead is transcendental and free of mundane characteristics.”**

### Purport

There are many impersonal statements about the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As stated in the *Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad* (3.19):

*apāṇi-pādo javano grahītā *
 *paśyaty acakṣuḥ sa śṛṇoty akarṇaḥ  
sa vetti vedyaṁ na ca tasyāsti vettā *
 *tam āhur agryaṁ puruṣaṁ mahāntam*

Although the Supreme Lord is described as having no hands and legs, He nonetheless accepts all sacrificial offerings. He has no eyes, yet He sees everything. He has no ears, yet He hears everything. When it is stated that the Supreme Lord has no hands and legs, one should not think that He is impersonal. Rather, He has no *mundane* hands or legs like ours. “He has no eyes, yet He sees.” This means that He does not have mundane, limited eyes like ours. Rather, He has such eyes that He can see past, present and future, everywhere, in every corner of the universe and in every corner of the heart of every living entity. Thus the impersonal descriptions in the *Vedas* intend to deny mundane characteristics in the Supreme Lord. They do not intend to establish the Supreme Lord as impersonal.

### Translation

**Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu continued, “ ‘Whatever Vedic mantras describe the Absolute Truth impersonally only prove in the end that the Absolute Truth is a person. The Supreme Lord is understood in two features — impersonal and personal. If one considers the Supreme Personality of Godhead in both features, he can actually understand the Absolute Truth. He knows that the personal understanding is stronger because we see that everything is full of variety. No one can see anything that is not full of variety.’**

### Verse text

*brahma haite janme viśva, brahmete jīvaya  
sei brahme punarapi haye yāya laya*

### Synonyms

*brahma* *haite* — from the Supreme Brahman; *janme* — emanates; *viśva* — the whole cosmic manifestation; *brahmete* — in the Absolute Truth; *jīvaya* — exists; *sei* — that; *brahme* — in the Absolute Truth; *punarapi* — again; *haye* — being; *yāya* — goes; *laya* — to annihilation.

### Translation

**“Everything in the cosmic manifestation emanates from the Absolute Truth, remains in the Absolute Truth, and after annihilation again enters the Absolute Truth.**

### Purport

In the *Taittirīya Upaniṣad* (3.1) it is said, *yato vā imāni bhūtāni jāyante:* “The entire material cosmic manifestation is born of the Supreme Brahman.” Also, the *Brahma-sūtra* begins with the verse *janmādy asya yataḥ:* “The Absolute Truth is that from whom everything emanates.” (Bs. 1.1.2) That Absolute Truth is Kṛṣṇa. In the *Bhagavad-gītā* (10.8), Kṛṣṇa says, *ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavo mattaḥ sarvaṁ pravartate:* “I am the source of all spiritual and material worlds. Everything emanates from Me.” Therefore Kṛṣṇa is the original Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Again, Kṛṣṇa states in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (9.4), *mayā tatam idaṁ sarvaṁ jagad avyakta-mūrtinā:* “By Me, in My unmanifested form, this entire universe is pervaded.” And as confirmed in the *Brahma-saṁhitā* (5.37), *goloka eva nivasaty akhilātma-bhūtaḥ:* “Although the Lord always stays in His abode, Goloka Vṛndāvana, He is still all-pervading.” His all-pervasive feature is understood to be impersonal because one does not find the form of the Lord in that all-pervasiveness. Actually, everything is resting on the rays of His bodily effulgence. The *Brahma-saṁhitā* (5.40) also states:

*yasya prabhā prabhavato jagad-aṇḍa-koṭi- *
 *koṭiṣv aśeṣa-vasudhādi-vibhūti-bhinnam*

Due to the rays of the Lord’s bodily effulgence, millions of universes are created, just as planets are created from the sun.

### Translation

**“The personal features of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are categorized in three cases — namely ablative, instrumental and locative.”**

### Purport

Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura states in his *Amṛta-pravāha-bhāṣya* that according to the injunction of the *Upaniṣads* (“the Supreme Absolute Truth is He from whom everything emanates”), it is understood that the whole cosmic manifestation emanated from Brahman, the Supreme Absolute Truth. The creation subsists by the energy of the Supreme Brahman and, after annihilation, merges into the Supreme Brahman. From this we can understand that the Absolute Truth can be categorized in three cases — ablative, instrumental and locative. According to these three cases, the Absolute Truth is positively personified. In this connection, Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī quotes the *Aitareya Upaniṣad* (1.1.1): *ātmā vā idam eka evāgra āsīn nānyat kiñcana miṣat sa īkṣata lokān nu sṛjā iti.* Similarly, in the *Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad* (4.9) it is stated:

*chandāṁsi yajñāḥ kratavo vratāni *
 *bhūtaṁ bhavyaṁ yac ca vedā vadanti  
yasmān māyī sṛjate viśvam etat *
 *tasmiṁś cānyo māyayā sanniruddhaḥ*

And in the *Taittirīya Upaniṣad* (3.1): *yato vā imāni bhūtāni jāyante, yena jātāni jīvanti, yat prayanty abhisaṁviśanti, tad vijijñāsasva tad brahma.* This was the answer given by father Varuṇa when questioned by his son Vāruṇi Bhṛgu about the Absolute Truth. In this *mantra,* the word *yataḥ,* the Absolute Truth from which the cosmic manifestation has emanated, is in the ablative case; that Brahman by which this universal creation is maintained is in the instrumental case (*yena*); and that Brahman into which the whole cosmic manifestation merges is in the locative case (*yat* or *yasmin*)*.* It is stated in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (1.5.20):

*idaṁ hi viśvaṁ bhagavān ivetaro *
 *yato jagat-sthāna-nirodha-sambhavāḥ*

“The entire universal creation is contained in the gigantic form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Everything emanates from Him, everything rests in His energy, and after annihilation everything merges into His person.”

### Translation

**Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu continued, “When the Supreme Personality of Godhead wished to become many, He glanced over the material energy. Before the creation there were no mundane eyes or mind; therefore the transcendental nature of the Absolute Truth’s mind and eyes is confirmed.**

### Purport

In the *Chāndogya Upaniṣad* (6.2.3), it is said, *tad aikṣata bahu syāṁ prajāyeya.* This statement confirms the fact that when the Supreme Personality of Godhead wishes to become many, the cosmic manifestation arises simply by His glancing over material energy. It may be noted that the Supreme Lord glanced over the material nature before the creation of this cosmic manifestation. Before the creation there were no material minds or material eyes; therefore the mind by which the Supreme Personality of Godhead desired to create is transcendental, and the eyes with which He glanced over material nature are also transcendental. Thus the Lord’s mind, eyes and other senses are all transcendental.

*brahma-śabde kahe pūrṇa svayaṁ bhagavān  
svayaṁ bhagavān kṛṣṇa, — śāstrera pramāṇa*

### Synonyms

*brahma*-*śabde* — by the word “Brahman”; *kahe* — it is said; *pūrṇa* — complete; *svayam* — personally; *bhagavān* — the Supreme Personality of Godhead; *svayam* — personally; *bhagavān* — the Supreme Personality of Godhead; *kṛṣṇa* — Lord Kṛṣṇa; *śāstrera* *pramāṇa* — the verdict of all Vedic literature.

### Translation

**“The word ‘Brahman’ indicates the complete Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is Śrī Kṛṣṇa. That is the verdict of all Vedic literature.**

### Purport

This is also confirmed in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (15.15), where the Lord says, *vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyaḥ.* The ultimate object in all Vedic literature is Kṛṣṇa. Everyone is searching for Him. This is also confirmed elsewhere in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (7.19):

*bahūnāṁ janmanām ante* *jñānavān māṁ prapadyate  
vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti* *sa mahātmā sudurlabhaḥ*

“After many births and deaths, he who is actually in knowledge surrenders unto Me, knowing Me to be the cause of all causes and all that is. Such a great soul is very rare.”

When one has actually become wise through the study of Vedic literature, he surrenders unto Vāsudeva, Bhagavān Śrī Kṛṣṇa. This is also confirmed in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (1.2.7-8):

*vāsudeve bhagavati* *bhakti-yogaḥ prayojitaḥ  
janayaty āśu vairāgyaṁ* *jñānaṁ ca yad ahaitukam*

*dharmaḥ sv-anuṣṭhitaḥ puṁsāṁ* *viṣvaksena-kathāsu yaḥ  
notpādayed yadi ratiṁ* *śrama eva hi kevalam*

Understanding Vāsudeva is real knowledge. By engaging in the devotional service of Vāsudeva, Kṛṣṇa, one acquires perfect knowledge and Vedic understanding. Thus one becomes detached from the material world. This is the perfection of human life. Although one may perfectly follow religious rituals and ceremonies, he is simply wasting his time (*śrama eva hi kevalam*) if he does not attain this perfection.

Before the creation of the cosmic manifestation, the Supreme Personality of Godhead possessed His totally transcendental mind and eyes. That Supreme Personality of Godhead is Kṛṣṇa. A person may think that there is no direct statement about Kṛṣṇa in the *Upaniṣads,* but the fact is that the Vedic *mantras* cannot be understood by people with mundane senses. As stated in the *Padma Purāṇa, ataḥ śrī-kṛṣṇa-nāmādi na bhaved grāhyam indriyaiḥ:* a person with mundane senses cannot fully understand the name, qualities, form and pastimes of Śrī Kṛṣṇa. The *Purāṇas* are therefore meant to explain and supplement Vedic knowledge. The great sages present the *Purāṇas* in order to make the Vedic *mantras* understandable for common men (*strī-śūdra-dvija-bandhūnām*)*.* Considering that women, *śūdras* and *dvija- bandhus* (unworthy sons of the twice-born) cannot understand the Vedic hymns directly, Śrīla Vyāsadeva compiled the *Mahābhārata.* Actually, the Supreme Personality of Godhead is *vedeṣu durlabham* (untraceable in the *Vedas*), but when the *Vedas* are properly understood or when Vedic knowledge is received from devotees, one can understand that all Vedic knowledge leads to Śrī Kṛṣṇa.

The *Brahma-sūtra* (1.1.3) confirms this fact also: *śāstra-yonitvāt.* commenting upon this *Brahma-sūtra* aphorism, Śrī Madhvācārya says, “The *Ṛg Veda, Yajur Veda, Sāma Veda, Atharva Veda, Mahābhārata, Pañcarātra* and the original Vālmīki *Rāmāyaṇa* are all Vedic literatures. Any literature following the conclusive statements of these Vedic literatures is also to be considered Vedic literature. That literature which does not conform to Vedic literature is simply misleading.”

Therefore when reading Vedic literature, we must take the path traversed by great *ācāryas: mahā-jano yena gataḥ sa panthāḥ.* Unless one follows the path traversed by great *ācāryas,* he cannot understand the real purport of the *Vedas.*

### Translation

**“All these mantras confirm that the Absolute Truth is personal, but the Māyāvādīs, throwing away the direct meaning, interpret the Absolute Truth as impersonal.**

### Purport

As mentioned above, the *Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad* (3.19) states:

*apāṇi-pādo javano grahītā *
 *paśyaty acakṣuḥ sa śṛṇoty akarṇaḥ  
sa vetti vedyaṁ na ca tasyāsti vettā *
 *tam āhur agryaṁ puruṣaṁ mahāntam*

This Vedic *mantra* clearly states, *puruṣaṁ mahāntam.* The word *puruṣa* means “person.” In the *Bhagavad-gītā* (10.12) Arjuna confirms that this person is Kṛṣṇa when he addresses Kṛṣṇa as *puruṣaṁ śāśvatam:* “You are the original person.” Thus the *puruṣaṁ mahāntam* mentioned in the verse from the *Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad* is Śrī Kṛṣṇa. His hands and legs are not mundane but are completely transcendental. However, when He comes, fools take Him to be an ordinary person (*avajānanti māṁ mūḍhā mānuṣīṁ tanum āśritam*)*.* One who has no Vedic knowledge, who has not studied the *Vedas* from a bona fide spiritual master, does not know Kṛṣṇa. Therefore he is a *mūḍha.* Such fools take Kṛṣṇa to be an ordinary person (*paraṁ bhāvam ajānantaḥ*)*.* They do not actually know what Kṛṣṇa is. *Manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu kaścid yatati siddhaye.* It is not possible to understand Kṛṣṇa simply by studying the *Vedas* perfectly. One must have the mercy of a devotee (*yat-pādam*)*.* Unless one is favored by a devotee, he cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Arjuna also confirms this in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (10.14): “My Lord, it is very difficult to understand Your personality.” The less intelligent class of men cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead without being favored by His devotee. Therefore the *Bhagavad-gītā* (4.34) contains another injunction:

*tad viddhi praṇipātena* *paripraśnena sevayā  
upadekṣyanti te jñānaṁ* *jñāninas tattva-darśinaḥ*

One has to approach a bona fide spiritual master and surrender to him. Only then can one understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead as a person.

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu now quotes four verses from the *Viṣṇu Purāṇa* (6.7.61-63 and 1.12.69) to explain the different potencies of the Lord.

kṣetra-jñākhyā tathā parā  
avidyā-karma-saṁjñānyā

### Synonyms

*viṣṇu*-*śaktiḥ* — the internal potency of Lord Viṣṇu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead; *parā* — spiritual; *proktā* — said; *kṣetra*-*jña* — the living entities; *ākhyā* — known as; *tathā* — also; *parā* — spiritual; *avidyā* — nescience, or godlessness; *karma* — and fruitive activities; *saṁjñā* — known as; *anyā* — another; *tṛtīyā* — third; *śaktiḥ* — potency; *iṣyate* — is accepted as.

### Translation

**“ ‘The internal potency of the Supreme Lord, Viṣṇu, is spiritual, as verified by the śāstras. There is another spiritual potency, known as kṣetra-jña, or the living entity. The third potency, which is known as nescience, makes the living entity godless and fills him with fruitive activity.**

### Purport

In the *Bhagavad-gītā,* in Śrī Kṛṣṇa’s discourse on the *kṣetra* and the *kṣetra-jña,* it is clearly stated that the *kṣetra-jña* is the living entity, who knows his field of activities. The living entities in the material world are forgetful of their eternal relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This forgetfulness is called *avidyā,* or nescience. The *avidyā-śakti,* the *avidyā* potency of the material world, provokes fruitive activity. Although this *avidyā-śakti* (material energy, or nescience) is also an energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, it is especially intended to keep the living entities in a state of forgetfulness. This is due to their rebellious attitude toward the Lord. Thus although the living entities are constitutionally spiritual, they come under the influence of the potency of nescience. How this happens is described in the following verse.

*yayā* — by which; *kṣetra*-*jña*-*śaktiḥ* — the living entities, known as the *kṣetra-jña* potency; *sā* — that potency; *veṣṭitā* — covered; *nṛpa* — O King; *sarva*-*gā* — capable of going anywhere in the spiritual or material worlds; *saṁsāra*-*tāpān* — miseries due to the cycle of repeated birth and death; *akhilān* — all kinds of; *avāpnoti* — obtains; *atra* — in this material world; *santatān* — arising from suffering or enjoying various kinds of reactions to fruitive activities.

### Translation

**“ ‘O King, the kṣetra-jña-śakti is the living entity. Although he has the facility to live in either the material or spiritual world, he suffers the threefold miseries of material existence because he is influenced by the avidyā \[nescience\] potency, which covers his constitutional position.**

### Translation

**“ ‘This living entity, covered by the influence of nescience, exists in different forms in the material condition. O King, he is thus proportionately freed from the influence of material energy, to a greater or lesser degree.’**

### Purport

The material energy acts on the living entity in different degrees, according to how he acquires the association of the three modes of material nature. There are 8,400,000 species of life, some inferior, some superior and some mediocre. The gradations of the bodies are calculated according to the covering of material energy. In the lower categories — including aquatics, trees, plants, insects, birds and so forth — spiritual consciousness is almost nonexistent. In the mediocre category — the human form of life — spiritual consciousness is comparatively awakened. In the superior life forms, spiritual consciousness is fully awakened. Then the living entity understands his real position and tries to escape the influence of material energy by developing Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

For the living entities, who are part and parcel of the Lord, the pleasure potency in the material world is sometimes displeasing and sometimes mixed.

According to the verdict of all Vedic literature, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the living entity and the illusory energy (this material world) constitute the subject matter of knowledge. Everyone should try to understand the relationship between them. First of all, one should try to understand the nature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. From the *śāstras* we understand that the nature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the sum total of eternity, bliss and knowledge. As stated in verse 154 (*viṣṇu-śaktiḥ parā proktā*), the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the reservoir of all potencies, and His potencies are all spiritual.

The spiritual potency of the Lord is manifested in three phases — the internal or spiritual potency, the marginal potency, which consists of the living entities, and the external potency, known as *māyā-śakti.* We must understand that in each of these three phases the original spiritual potencies of pleasure, eternity and knowledge remain intact. When the potencies of spiritual pleasure and knowledge are both bestowed upon the conditioned souls, the conditioned souls can escape the clutches of the external potency, *māyā,* which acts as a cover obscuring one’s spiritual identity. When freed, the living entity awakens to Kṛṣṇa consciousness and engages in devotional service with love and affection.

### Purport

The Supreme Personality of Godhead is by nature the master of all potencies. By nature, the living entities, being infinitesimal, are always under the influence of the Lord’s potencies. According to the *Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad* (3.1.1-2):

*dvā suparṇā sayujā sakhāyā *
 *samānaṁ vṛkṣaṁ pariṣasvajāte  
tayor anyaḥ pippalaṁ svādv atty *
 *anaśnann anyo ’bhicākaśīti*

*samāne vṛkṣe puruṣo nimagno *
 *’nīśayā śocati muhyamānaḥ  
juṣṭaṁ yadā paśyaty anyam īśam *
 *asya mahimānam eti vīta-śokaḥ*

The *Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad* completely distinguishes the Lord from the living entities. The living entity is subjected to the reactions of fruitive activity, whereas the Lord simply witnesses such activity and bestows the results. According to the living entity’s desires, he is wandering from one body to another and from one planet to another, under the direction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Paramātmā. However, when the living entity comes to his senses by the mercy of the Lord, he is awarded devotional service. Thus he is saved from the clutches of *māyā.* At such a time he can see his eternal friend, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and become free from all lamentation and hankering. This is confirmed in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (18.54), where the Lord says, *brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā na śocati na kāṅkṣati:* “One who is thus transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman and becomes fully joyful. He never laments or desires to have anything.” Thus it is definitely proved that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the master of all potencies and that the living entities are always subjected to these potencies. That is the difference between *māyādhīśa* and *māyā-vaśa.*

According to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s philosophy of *acintya-bhedābheda-tattva,* the living entity and the Supreme Lord are accepted as one and different at the same time.

### Translation

**“One who does not accept the transcendental form of the Lord is certainly an agnostic. Such a person should be neither seen nor touched. Indeed, he is subject to be punished by Yamarāja.**

### Purport

According to the Vedic instructions, the Supreme Personality of Godhead has His eternal, transcendental form, which is always blissful and full of knowledge. Impersonalists think that “material” refers to the forms within our experience and that “spiritual” refers to an absence of form. However, one should know that beyond this material nature is another nature, which is spiritual. Just as there are material forms in this material world, there are spiritual forms in the spiritual world. This is confirmed by all Vedic literature. The spiritual forms in the transcendental world have nothing to do with the negative conception of formlessness. The conclusion is that a person is an agnostic when he does not agree to worship the transcendental form of the Lord.

Actually, at the present moment all systems of religion deny the worship of the form of the Lord due to ignorance of His transcendental form. The first-class materialists (the Māyāvādīs) imagine five specific forms of the Lord, but when they try to equate the worship of such imaginary forms with *bhakti,* they are immediately condemned. Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa confirms this in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (7.15), where He says, *na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ prapadyante narādhamāḥ.* Bereft of real knowledge due to agnosticism, the Māyāvādī philosophers should not even be seen by the devotees of the Lord, nor touched, because those philosophers are liable to be punished by Yamarāja, the superintendent demigod who judges the activities of sinful men. The Māyāvādī agnostics wander within this universe in different species of life due to their nondevotional activities. Such living entities are subjected to the punishments of Yamarāja. Only the devotees, who are always engaged in the service of the Lord, are exempt from the jurisdiction of Yamarāja.

### Translation

**“The Buddhists do not recognize the authority of the Vedas; therefore they are considered agnostics. However, those who have taken shelter of the Vedic scriptures yet preach agnosticism in accordance with the Māyāvāda philosophy are certainly more dangerous than the Buddhists.**

### Purport

Although the Buddhists are directly opposed to Vaiṣṇava philosophy, it can easily be understood that the Śaṅkarites are more dangerous because they accept the authority of the *Vedas* yet act contrary to Vedic instruction. *Vedāśraya nāstikya-vāda* means “agnosticism under the shelter of Vedic culture” and refers to the monistic philosophy of the Māyāvādīs. Lord Buddha abandoned the authority of the Vedic literature and therefore rejected the ritualistic ceremonies and sacrifices recommended in the *Vedas.* His *nirvāṇa* philosophy means stopping all material activities. Lord Buddha did not recognize the presence of transcendental forms and spiritual activities beyond the material world. He simply described voidism beyond this material existence. The Māyāvādī philosophers offer lip service to Vedic authority but try to escape the Vedic ritualistic ceremonies. They concoct some idea of a transcendental position and call themselves Nārāyaṇa, or God. However, God’s position is completely different from their concoction. Such Māyāvādī philosophers consider themselves above the influence of *karma-kāṇḍa* (fruitive activities and their reactions). For them, the spiritual world is equated with the Buddhist voidism. There is very little difference between impersonalism and voidism. Voidism can be directly understood, but the impersonalism enunciated by Māyāvādī philosophers is not very easily understandable. Of course, Māyāvādī philosophers accept a spiritual existence, but they do not know about the spiritual world and spiritual beings. According to *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (10.2.32):

*ye ’nye ’ravindākṣa vimukta-māninas *
 *tvayy asta-bhāvād aviśuddha-buddhayaḥ  
āruhya kṛcchreṇa paraṁ padaṁ tataḥ *
 *patanty adho ’nādṛta-yuṣmad-aṅghrayaḥ*

The intelligence of the Māyāvādīs is not purified; therefore even though they practice austerities for self-realization, they cannot remain within the impersonal *brahmajyoti.* Consequently, they fall down again into this material world.

The Māyāvādīs’ conception of spiritual existence is almost identical to the negation of material existence. The Māyāvādīs believe that there is nothing positive in spiritual life. As a result, they cannot understand devotional service or the worship of the Supreme Person, *sac-cid-ānanda-vigraha.* The Māyāvādī philosophers consider Deity worship in devotional service to be *pratibimba-vāda,* or the worship of a form that is the reflection of a false material form. Thus the Lord’s transcendental form, which is eternally blissful and full of knowledge, is unknown to Māyāvādī philosophers. Although the term “Bhagavān” is explicitly described in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,* they cannot understand it. *Brahmeti paramātmeti bhagavān iti śabdyate:* “The Absolute Truth is called Brahman, Paramātmā and Bhagavān.” (*Bhāg.* 1.2.11) The Māyāvādīs try to understand Brahman only, or, at the most, Paramātmā. However, they are unable to understand Bhagavān. Therefore the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, says, *māyayāpahṛta-jñānāḥ.* Because of the temperament of the Māyāvādī philosophers, real knowledge is taken from them. Because they cannot receive the mercy of the Lord, they will always be bewildered by His transcendental form. Impersonal philosophy destroys the three phases of knowledge — *jñāna, jñeya* and *jñātā.* As soon as one speaks of knowledge, there must be a person who is the knower, the knowledge itself and the object of knowledge. Māyāvāda philosophy combines these three categories; therefore the Māyāvādīs cannot understand how the spiritual potencies of the Supreme Personality of Godhead act. Because of their poor fund of knowledge, they cannot understand the distinction in the spiritual world between knowledge, the knower and the object of knowledge. Because of this, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu considers the Māyāvādī philosophers more dangerous than the Buddhists.

### Translation

**“Śrīla Vyāsadeva presented the Vedānta philosophy for the deliverance of conditioned souls, but if one hears the commentary of Śaṅkarācārya, everything is spoiled.**

### Purport

Factually, the devotional service of the Lord is described in the *Vedānta-sūtra,* but the Māyāvādī philosophers, the Śaṅkarites, prepared a commentary known as *Śārīraka-bhāṣya,* in which the transcendental form of the Lord is denied. The Māyāvādī philosophers think that the living entity is identical with the Supreme Soul, Brahman. Their commentaries on the *Vedānta-sūtra* are completely opposed to the principle of devotional service. Caitanya Mahāprabhu therefore warns us to avoid these commentaries. If one indulges in hearing the Śaṅkarite *Śārīraka-bhāṣya,* he will certainly be bereft of all real knowledge.

The ambitious Māyāvādī philosophers desire to merge into the existence of the Lord, and this may be accepted as *sāyujya-mukti.* However, this form of *mukti* means denying one’s individual existence. In other words, it is a kind of spiritual suicide. This is absolutely opposed to the philosophy of *bhakti-yoga. Bhakti-yoga* offers immortality to the individual conditioned soul. If one follows the Māyāvādī philosophy, he misses his opportunity to become immortal after giving up the material body. The immortality of the individual person is the highest perfectional stage a living entity can attain.

*maṇi yaiche avikṛte prasabe hema-bhāra  
jagad-rūpa haya īśvara, tabu avikāra*

### Synonyms

*maṇi* — the touchstone; *yaiche* — just as; *avikṛte* — without being transformed; *prasabe* — produces; *hema*-*bhāra* — volumes of gold; *jagat*-*rūpa* — the cosmic manifestation; *haya* — becomes; *īśvara* — the Supreme Personality of Godhead; *tabu* — still; *avikāra* — unchanged.

### Translation

**“The touchstone, after touching iron, produces volumes of gold without being changed. Similarly, the Supreme Personality of Godhead manifests Himself as the cosmic manifestation by His inconceivable potency, yet He remains unchanged in His eternal, transcendental form.**

### Purport

According to the commentary of Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura, the purpose of the *janmādy asya* verse in the *Vedānta-sūtra* is to establish that the cosmic manifestation is the result of the transformation of the potencies of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Supreme Lord is the master of innumerable eternal energies, which are unlimited. Sometimes these energies are manifested, and sometimes they are not. In any case, all energies are under His control; therefore He is the original energetic, the abode of all energies. A common brain in the conditioned state cannot conceive of how these inconceivable energies abide in the Supreme Personality of Godhead, how He exists in His innumerable forms as the master of both spiritual and material energies, how He is the master of both manifest and potential powers, and how contradictory potencies can abide in Him. As long as the living entity is within this material world, in the condition of illusion, he cannot understand the activities of the inconceivable energies of the Lord. Thus the Lord’s energies, though factual, are simply beyond the power of the common brain to understand.

When the atheistic philosophers or the Māyāvādīs, being unable to understand the inconceivable energies of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, imagine an impersonal void, their imagination is only the counterpart of materialistic thinking. Within the material world, there is nothing inconceivable. High-thinking philosophers and scientists can tackle the material energy, but not being able to understand the spiritual energy, they can simply imagine an inactive state, such as the impersonal Brahman. This is simply the negative side of material life. By such imperfect knowledge, the Māyāvādī philosophers conclude that the cosmic manifestation is a transformation of the Supreme. Thus they must necessarily also accept the theory of the illusion of the Supreme (*vivarta-vāda*)*.* However, if we accept the inconceivable potencies of the Lord, we can understand how the Supreme Personality of Godhead can appear within this material world without being touched or contaminated by the three modes of material nature.

From the *śāstras* we learn that there is a stone or jewel called a touchstone that can transform iron into gold. Although the touchstone turns iron into gold many times, it remains in its original condition. If such a material stone can maintain its inconceivable energy after producing volumes of gold, certainly the Supreme Personality of Godhead can remain in His original *sac-cid-ānanda* form after creating the cosmic world. As confirmed in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (9.10), He acts only through His different energies. *Mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ:* Kṛṣṇa directs the material energy, and that potency works in this material world. This is also confirmed in the *Brahma-saṁhitā* (5.44):

*sṛṣṭi-sthiti-pralaya-sādhana-śaktir ekā *
 *chāyeva yasya bhuvanāni bibharti durgā  
icchānurūpam api yasya ca ceṣṭate sā *
 *govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi*

The *durgā-śakti* (material energy) acts under the direction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the universal creation, maintenance and destruction are being carried out by the *durgā-śakti.* Kṛṣṇa’s direction is in the background. The conclusion is that the Supreme Personality of Godhead remains as He is, even though directing His energy, which makes the diverse cosmic manifestation work so wonderfully.

व्यास — भ्रान्त वलि’ सेइ सूत्रे दोष दिय़ा ।

### Verse text

*vyāsa — bhrānta bali’ sei sūtre doṣa diyā  
‘vivarta-vāda’ sthāpiyāche kalpanā kariyā*

### Synonyms

*vyāsa* — Śrīla Vyāsadeva; *bhrānta* — mistaken; *bali’* — saying; *sei* — that; *sūtre* — in the *Vedānta-sūtra*; *doṣa* — fault; *diyā* — accusing; *vivarta*-*vāda* — the theory of illusion; *sthāpiyāche* — has established; *kalpanā* — imagination; *kariyā* — doing.

### Translation

**“Śaṅkarācārya states that the theory of transformation presented in the Vedānta-sūtra implies that the Absolute Truth itself is transformed. In this way the Māyāvādī philosophers denigrate Śrīla Vyāsadeva by accusing him of error. They thus find fault in the Vedānta-sūtra and misinterpret it to try to establish the theory of illusion.**

### Purport

The first verse of the *Brahma-sūtra* is *athāto brahma-jijñāsā:* “We must now inquire into the Absolute Truth.” The second verse immediately answers, *janmādy asya yataḥ:* “The Absolute Truth is the original source of everything.” *Janmādy asya yataḥ* does not suggest that the original person has been transformed. Rather, it clearly indicates that He produces this cosmic manifestation through His inconceivable energy. This is also clearly explained in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (10.8), where Kṛṣṇa says, *mattaḥ sarvaṁ pravartate:* “From Me, everything emanates.” This is also confirmed in the *Taittirīya Upaniṣad* (3.1.1): *yato vā imāni bhūtāni jāyante.* “The Supreme Absolute Truth is that from which everything is born.” Similarly, in the *Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad* (1.1.7) it is stated, *yathorṇa-nābhiḥ sṛjate gṛhṇate ca:* “\[The Lord creates and destroys the cosmic manifestation\] as a spider creates a web and draws it back within itself.” All of these śāstric statements indicate the transformation of the Lord’s energy, not of the Lord Himself. Tranformation of the Lord’s energy is called *pariṇāma-vāda.* However, being very anxious to protect Śrīla Vyāsadeva from criticism, Śaṅkarācārya became a pseudo gentleman and put forward his theory of illusion (*vivarta-vāda*)*.* Śaṅkarācārya concocted this meaning of *pariṇāma-vāda,* and by word jugglery he endeavored very hard to establish *pariṇāma-vāda* as *vivarta-vāda.*

*jīvera dehe ātma-buddhi — sei mithyā haya  
jagat ye mithyā nahe, naśvara-mātra haya*

### Synonyms

*jīvera* — of the living entities; *dehe* — in the body; *ātma*-*buddhi* — considering as the self; *sei* — that; *mithyā* — untruth; *haya* — is; *jagat* — the cosmic manifestation; *ye* — that; *mithyā* — untruth; *nahe* — not; *naśvara*-*mātra* — only temporary; *haya* — is.

### Translation

**“The theory of illusion can be applied only when the living entity identifies himself with the body. As far as the cosmic manifestation is concerned, it cannot be called false, although it is certainly temporary.**

### Purport

The living entity is the eternal servant of Kṛṣṇa. Being part and parcel of the Lord, he is constitutionally pure, but due to his contact with material energy, he identifies himself with either the gross or the subtle material body. Such identification is certainly false and constitutes the genuine platform of the theory of illusion. The living entity is eternal: he can never be subjected to the limits of time, as are his gross and subtle bodies. The cosmic manifestation is never false, but it is subject to change by the influence of the time factor. For a living entity to accept this cosmic manifestation as the field for his sense enjoyment is certainly illusory. This material world is the manifestation of the material energy of the Lord. This is explained by Kṛṣṇa in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (7.4):

*bhūmir āpo ’nalo vāyuḥ* *khaṁ mano buddhir eva ca  
ahaṅkāra itīyaṁ me* *bhinnā prakṛtir aṣṭadhā*

“Earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence and false ego — all together these eight constitute My separated material energies.”

The material world is the inferior energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but it is not a fact that the Supreme Lord has been transformed into this material world. The Māyāvādī philosophers, devoid of true understanding, have confused the theory of illusion and the theory of the cosmic manifestation by word jugglery. The theory of illusion can be applied to a person who identifies himself with the body. The living entity is the superior energy of the Supreme Lord, and the material world is the inferior energy. Both, however, are *prakṛti* (energy). Although the energies are simultaneously one with the Lord and different from Him, the Lord never loses His personal form due to the transformation of His different energies.

*‘tat tvam asi’ — jīva-hetu prādeśika vākya  
praṇava nā māni’ tāre kahe mahā-vākya*

### Synonyms

*tat* *tvam* *asi* — you are the same; *jīva*-*hetu* — for the enlightenment of the conditioned soul; *prādeśika* — subsidiary; *vākya* — vibration; *praṇava* — the *oṁkāra* incarnation; *nā* — not; *māni’* — accepting; *tāre* — that; *kahe* — says; *mahā*-*vākya* — transcendental vibration.

### Translation

**“The subsidiary vibration tat tvam asi \[“you are the same”\] is meant for the understanding of the living entity, but the principal vibration is oṁkāra. Not caring for oṁkāra, Śaṅkarācārya has stressed the vibration tat tvam asi.”**

### Purport

*Tat tvam asi* is accepted as the primary vibration by one who does not accept *praṇava,* the transcendental sound incarnation of the holy name of the Lord, as the chief principle in the Vedic literature. By word jugglery, Śaṅkarācārya tried to create an illusory presentation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His relationship with the living entities and the cosmic manifestation. *Tat tvam asi* is a warning to the living entity not to mistake the body for the self. Therefore *tat tvam asi* is especially meant for the conditioned soul. The chanting of *oṁkāra* or the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra* is meant for the liberated soul. Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī has said, *ayi mukta-kulair upāsyamānam* (*Nāmāṣṭaka* 1). Thus the holy name of the Lord is chanted by the liberated souls. Similarly, Parīkṣit Mahārāja says, *nivṛtta-tarṣair upagīyamānāt* (*Bhāg.* 10.1.4). The holy name of the Lord can be chanted by those who have fully satisfied their material desires or who are fully situated on the transcendental platform and devoid of material desire. The name of the Lord can be chanted by one who is completely freed from material contamination (*anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyaṁ jñāna-karmādy-anāvṛtam*)*.* Śaṅkarācārya has indirectly minimized the value of the principal Vedic *mantra* (*oṁkāra*) by accepting a subordinate vibration (*tat tvam asi*) as the most important Vedic *mantra.*

**Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu continued, “The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the central point of all relationships, acting in devotional service to Him is one’s real occupation, and the attainment of love of Godhead is the ultimate goal of life. These three subject matters are described in the Vedic literature.**

### Purport

In the *Bhagavad-gītā* (15.15) Lord Kṛṣṇa confirms this statement: *vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyaḥ.* The actual purpose in reading the *Vedas* is to learn how to become a devotee of the Supreme Lord. The Lord Himself advises, *man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru* (Bg. 9.34). Therefore, after studying the *Vedas,* one must then execute devotional service by thinking always of the Supreme Lord (*man-manā*), becoming His devotee, worshiping Him and always offering Him obeisances. This is called *viṣṇu-ārādhana,* and it is the supreme occupational duty of all human beings. It is properly discharged in the *varṇāśrama-dharma* system, which divides society into *brahmacarya, gṛhastha, vānaprastha* and *sannyāsa* and *brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya* and *śūdra.* This is the whole scheme of Vedic civilization. However, this institution is very difficult to establish in this age; therefore Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu advises that we not worry about the Vedic system of *varṇāśrama-dharma.* Rather, we should take directly to the chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra* and simply hear about the Supreme Personality of Godhead from pure devotees. This is the process recommended by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and this is the purpose for studying the *Vedas.*

### Translation

**“If one tries to explain the Vedic literature in a different way, he is indulging in imagination. Any interpretation of the self-evident Vedic version is simply imaginary.**

### Purport

When a conditioned soul is purified, he is called a devotee. A devotee has his relationship only with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and his only occupational duty is to execute devotional service to satisfy the Lord. This service is rendered through the Lord’s representative, the spiritual master: *yasya deve parā bhaktir yathā deve tathā gurau.* When the devotee executes devotional service properly, he attains the highest perfection of life — love of Godhead: *sa vai puṁsāṁ paro dharmo yato bhaktir adhokṣaje.* The ultimate goal of understanding the *Vedas* is to be elevated to the platform of rendering loving service to the Lord. The Māyāvādī philosophers, however, consider the central point of relationship to be the impersonal Brahman, the function of the living entity to be the acquisition of knowledge of Brahman, resulting in detachment from material activity, and the ultimate goal of life to be liberation, or merging into the existence of the Supreme. All of this, however, is simply due to the imagination of the conditioned soul. It simply opposes him to material activities. One should always remember that all Vedic literatures are self-evident. No one is allowed to interpret the Vedic verses. If one does so, he indulges in imagination, and that has no value.

There are many different branches of these categories, but the Supreme Personality of Godhead, by His inconceivable potencies and transcendental qualities, attracts the mind of the student engaged in the activities of *karma, jñāna, yoga* and so forth. The Supreme Lord is full of inconceivable potencies, which are related to His person, His energies and His transcendental qualities. All of these are very attractive to the serious student. Consequently the Lord is known as Kṛṣṇa, the all-attractive one.

**Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu explained the meaning of the verse by giving evidence concerning Śukadeva Gosvāmī and the four ṛṣis Sanaka, Sanat-kumāra, Sanātana and Sanandana. Thus the Lord gave various meanings and explanations.**

### Purport

That Kṛṣṇa is all-attractive is verified by the activities of the four *ṛṣis* and Śukadeva Gosvāmī. All of them were liberated persons, yet they were attracted by the qualities and pastimes of the Lord. It is therefore said, *muktā api līlayā vigrahaṁ kṛtvā bhagavantaṁ bhajante:* “Even liberated persons are attracted by the pastimes of Lord Kṛṣṇa and thus engage in devotional service.” (Cc. *Madhya* 24.112) From the very beginning of their lives, Śukadeva Gosvāmī and the four Kumāras, known as *catuḥ-sana,* were liberated and self-realized on the Brahman platform. Nonetheless, they were attracted by the qualities of Kṛṣṇa, and they engaged in His service. The four Kumāras were attracted by the aroma of the flowers offered at the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, and in this way they became devotees. Śukadeva Gosvāmī heard *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* by the mercy of his father, Vyāsadeva, and he was consequently attracted to Kṛṣṇa and became a great devotee. The conclusion is that the transcendental bliss experienced in the service of the Lord must be superior to *brahmānanda,* the bliss derived from realizing the impersonal Brahman.

### Purport

The goal of human perfection is stated here in brief. One has to surpass all the planetary systems of the material universe, pierce through the covering of the universe and reach the spiritual world, known as Vaikuṇṭhaloka. The Vaikuṇṭhalokas are variegated spiritual planets situated in the Lord’s impersonal bodily effulgence, known as the *brahmajyoti.* One may aspire to elevate himself to a heavenly planet within the material world, such as the moon, the sun or Venus, but if one is spiritually advanced in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he does not wish to remain within the material universe, even in a higher planetary system. Rather, he prefers to penetrate the covering of the universe and attain the spiritual world. He can then be situated in one of the Vaikuṇṭha planets there. However, the devotees under the guidance of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu aspire to reach the topmost spiritual planet, known as Goloka Vṛndāvana, the residence of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa and His eternal associates.

### Translation

**“ ‘When a person takes shelter of the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead without reservation, the unlimited, merciful Lord bestows His causeless mercy upon him. Thus he can pass over the insurmountable ocean of nescience. Those whose intelligence is fixed in the bodily conception, who think, “I am this body,” are fit food for dogs and jackals. The Supreme Lord never bestows His mercy upon such people.’ ”**

### Purport

The Supreme Lord never bestows His benediction upon those fixed in the bodily conception. As Kṛṣṇa clearly states in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (18.66):

*sarva-dharmān parityajya* *mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja  
ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo* *mokṣayiṣyāmi mā śucaḥ*

“Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. I shall deliver you from all sinful reactions. Do not fear.”

The verse that Caitanya Mahāprabhu quoted (*Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* 2.7.42) explains the meaning of Śrī Kṛṣṇa’s statement. Kṛṣṇa bestowed His causeless mercy upon Arjuna just to get him out of the bodily conception. This was done at the very beginning of the second chapter of the *Bhagavad-gītā* (2.13), where Kṛṣṇa says, *dehino ’smin yathā dehe kaumāraṁ yauvanaṁ jarā.* In this body, there is an owner, and one should not consider the body to be the self. This is the first instruction to be assimilated by a devotee. If one is under the bodily conception, he is unable to realize his true identity and engage in the loving devotional service of the Lord. Unless one comes to the transcendental position, he cannot expect the causeless mercy of the Supreme Lord, nor can he cross over the vast ocean of material nescience. Lord Kṛṣṇa confirms this in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (7.14): *mām eva ye prapadyante māyām etāṁ taranti te.* Without surrendering unto the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, one cannot expect release from the clutches of *māyā,* the illusory energy. According to *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (10.2.32), Māyāvādī *sannyāsīs* who falsely think of themselves as liberated from the clutches of *māyā* are called *vimukta-māninaḥ.* Actually, they are not liberated, but they think that they have become liberated and have become Nārāyaṇa Himself. Although they have apparently realized that they are not the material body but spirit soul, they nonetheless neglect the duty of the spirit soul, which is to render service to the Supreme Soul. Therefore their intelligence remains unsanctified. Unless one’s intelligence is sanctified, one cannot apply it to understanding devotional service. Devotional service begins when the mind, intelligence and ego are completely purified. Māyāvādī *sannyāsīs* do not purify their intelligence, mind and ego, and consequently they cannot engage in the service of the Lord or expect the causeless mercy of the Lord. Although they rise to a very high position by executing severe austerities and penances, they still hover in the material world without the benediction of the lotus feet of the Lord. Sometimes they rise to the Brahman effulgence, but because their minds are not completely purified, they must return to material existence.

The *karmīs* are fully under the bodily conception of life, and the *jñānīs,* although theoretically understanding that they are not the body, also have no information about the lotus feet of the Lord because they overly stress impersonalism. Consequently both *karmīs* and *jñānīs* are unfit for receiving the mercy of the Lord and becoming devotees. Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura therefore says, *karma-kāṇḍa jñāna-kāṇḍa, kevala viṣera bhāṇḍa:* those who have taken to the process of *karma-kāṇḍa* (fruitive activity) and *jñāna-kāṇḍa* (speculation on the science of transcendence) have simply eaten from poisoned pots. They are condemned to remain in material existence life after life until they take shelter of the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa. This is confirmed in *Śrīmad Bhagavad-gītā* (7.19):

*bahūnāṁ janmanām ante* *jñānavān māṁ prapadyate  
vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti* *sa mahātmā su-durlabhaḥ*

“After many births and deaths, he who is actually in knowledge surrenders unto Me, knowing Me to be the cause of all causes and all that is. Such a great soul is very rare.”

*bhakti-sādhana-śreṣṭha śunite haila mana

### Translation

**Then the Bhaṭṭācārya asked Caitanya Mahāprabhu, “Which item is most important in the execution of devotional service?” The Lord replied that the most important item was the chanting of the holy name of the Lord.**

### Purport

There are nine items to be executed in devotional service. These are enumerated in the following verse from *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (7.5.23):

*śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ* *smaraṇaṁ pāda-sevanam  
arcanaṁ vandanaṁ dāsyaṁ* *sakhyam ātma-nivedanam*

Hearing the glories of the Lord, chanting, remembering, serving the lotus feet of the Lord, offering worship in the temple, offering prayers, becoming a servant of the Lord, becoming the Lord’s friend, and *sarvātma-nivedana,* offering oneself fully at the lotus feet of the Lord — these are the nine devotional processes. In *The Nectar of Devotion,* these are expanded into sixty-four items. When Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya asked the Lord which item was most important, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu immediately answered that the most important item is the chanting of the holy names of the Lord — Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare. He then quoted the following verse from the *Bṛhan-nāradīya Purāṇa* (thirty-eighth chapter, verse 126) to confirm His statement.

### Translation

**“ ‘In this age of quarrel and hypocrisy, the only means of deliverance is the chanting of the holy names of the Lord. There is no other way. There is no other way. There is no other way.’ ”**

### Purport

Because the people of this age are so fallen, they can simply chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra.* In this way they can rid themselves of the bodily conception of life and become eligible to engage in the Lord’s devotional service. One cannot engage in the devotional service of the Lord without being purified of all contamination. This is confirmed in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (7.28):

*yeṣāṁ tv anta-gataṁ pāpaṁ* *janānāṁ puṇya-karmaṇām  
te dvandva-moha-nirmuktā* *bhajante māṁ dṛḍha-vratāḥ*

“Persons who have acted piously in previous lives and in this life and whose sinful actions are completely eradicated are freed from the dualities of delusion, and they engage themselves in My service with determination.” Sometimes people are surprised to see young men and women take so seriously to the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. By giving up sinful activity — illicit sex, meat-eating, intoxication and gambling — and strictly following the injunctions given by the spiritual master, they have become purified of all contamination. They can therefore fully engage in the devotional service of the Lord.

In this Age of Kali, *hari-kīrtana* is very, very important. The importance of chanting the holy name of the Lord is stated in the following verses from *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (12.3.51-52):

*kaler doṣa-nidhe rājann* *asti hy eko mahān guṇaḥ  
kīrtanād eva kṛṣṇasya* *mukta-saṅgaḥ paraṁ vrajet*

*kṛte yad dhyāyato viṣṇuṁ* *tretāyāṁ yajato makhaiḥ  
dvāpare paricaryāyāṁ* *kalau tad dhari-kīrtanāt*

“The most important factor in this Age of Kali, which is an ocean of faults, is that one can be free from all contamination and become eligible to enter the kingdom of God simply by chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra.* The self-realization that was achieved in the Satya millennium by meditation, in the Tretā millennium by the performance of different sacrifices, and in the Dvāpara millennium by worship of Lord Kṛṣṇa can be achieved in the Age of Kali simply by chanting the holy names, Hare Kṛṣṇa.”

### Translation

**Gopīnātha Ācārya reminded Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya, “My dear Bhaṭṭācārya, what I foretold to you has now taken place.”**

### Purport

Previously Gopīnātha Ācārya had informed Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya that when he would be blessed by the Lord he would thoroughly understand the transcendental process of devotional service. This prediction was now fulfilled. The Bhaṭṭācārya was fully converted to the cult of Vaiṣṇavism, and he was following the principles automatically, without being pressured. In the *Bhagavad-gītā* (2.40) it is therefore said, *sv-alpam apy asya dharmasya trāyate mahato bhayāt:* “Simply by performing a little devotional service, one can escape the greatest danger.” Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya had been in the greatest danger because he had adhered to Māyāvāda philosophy. Somehow or other he came into contact with Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and became a perfect devotee. In this way he was saved from the great falldown of impersonalism.

**“Let my consciousness, which is like a honeybee, take shelter of the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who has just now appeared as Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya Mahāprabhu to teach the ancient system of devotional service to Himself. This system had almost been lost due to the influence of time.”**

### Purport

As Lord Kṛṣṇa states in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (4.7):

*yadā yadā hi dharmasya* *glānir bhavati bhārata  
abhyutthānam adharmasya* *tadātmānaṁ sṛjāmy aham*

“Whenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice, O descendant of Bharata, and a predominant rise of irreligion — at that time I descend Myself.”

This is also the case with Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s appearance. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu appeared in this world as a disguised incarnation of Kṛṣṇa, but His appearance is confirmed in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,* the *Mahābhārata* and other Vedic scriptures. He appeared in order to teach the fallen souls in this material world, for in this Age of Kali almost everyone has become attached to fruitive and ritualistic activities and mental speculation. Consequently there was a great need to revive the system of devotional service. The Lord Himself personally came down disguised as a devotee so that the fallen populace might take advantage of the Lord’s example.

At the conclusion of the *Bhagavad-gītā,* Lord Kṛṣṇa advised complete surrender unto Him, promising all protection to His devotee. Unfortunately, people are so fallen that they cannot accept the instructions of Lord Kṛṣṇa; therefore Kṛṣṇa returned with the same mission, but He executed it in a different way. As Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, He ordered us to surrender unto Himself, but as Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, He taught us how to surrender to Kṛṣṇa. Therefore He is praised by the Gosvāmīs: *namo mahā-vadānyāya kṛṣṇa-prema-pradāye te.* Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa is certainly the Personality of Godhead, but He is not as magnanimous as Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Lord Kṛṣṇa simply gave orders for one to become His devotee (*man-manā bhava mad-bhaktaḥ*), but Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu actually taught the process of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. If one wants to become a devotee of Kṛṣṇa, he must first take shelter of the lotus feet of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, following in the footsteps of Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya and other exalted devotees.

### Translation

**The Bhaṭṭācārya recited, “ ‘One who seeks Your compassion and thus tolerates all kinds of adverse conditions due to the karma of his past deeds, who engages always in Your devotional service with his mind, words and body, and who always offers obeisances unto You is certainly a bona fide candidate for becoming Your unalloyed devotee.’ ”**

### Purport

When reciting this verse from *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (10.14.8), Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya changed the original reading from *mukti-pade* to *bhakti-pade. Mukti* means liberation and merging into the impersonal Brahman effulgence. *Bhakti* means rendering transcendental service unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Because of having developed pure devotional service, the Bhaṭṭācārya did not like the word *mukti-pade,* which refers to the impersonal Brahman feature of the Lord. However, he was not authorized to change a word in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,* as Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu will explain. Although the Bhaṭṭācārya changed the word in his devotional ecstasy, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu did not approve of it.

### Synonyms

*bhaṭṭācārya* — Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya; *kahe* — said; *bhakti* — devotional service; *sama* — equal to; *nahe* — not; *mukti* — of liberation; *phala* — the result; *bhagavat*-*bhakti* — to the devotional service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; *vimukhera* — of one who is averse to; *haya* — it is; *daṇḍa* — the punishment; *kevala* — only.

### Translation

**Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya replied, “The awakening of pure love of Godhead, which is the result of devotional service, far surpasses liberation from material bondage. For those averse to devotional service, merging into the Brahman effulgence is a kind of punishment.”**

### Purport

In the *Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa* it is said:

*siddha-lokas tu tamasaḥ* *pāre yatra vasanti hi  
siddhā brahma-sukhe magnā* *daityāś ca hariṇā hatāḥ*

“In Siddhaloka \[Brahmaloka\] there live two kinds of living entities — those who are killed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead due to their having been demons in their previous lives and those who are very fond of enjoying the impersonal effulgence of the Lord.” The word *tamasaḥ* means “the coverings of the universe.” Layers of material elements cover the universe, and outside these coverings is the impersonal Brahman effulgence. If one is destined to remain in the Lord’s impersonal effulgence, he misses the opportunity to render service to the Personality of Godhead. Therefore devotees consider remaining in the impersonal Brahman effulgence a kind of punishment. Sometimes devotees think of merging into the Brahman effulgence, and consequently they are promoted to Siddhaloka. Because of their impersonal understanding, they are actually punished. Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya continues to explain the distinction between *mukti-pada* and *bhakti-pada* in the following verses.

### Translation

**“A pure devotee does not like even to hear about sāyujya-mukti, which inspires him with fear and hatred. Indeed, the pure devotee would rather go to hell than merge into the effulgence of the Lord.”**

### Purport

Śrīla Prabodhānanda Sarasvatī has sung, *kaivalyaṁ narakāyate.* The impersonalist’s conception of becoming one with the effulgence of the Lord is exactly like hell. Therefore, of the five types of liberation, the first four (*sālokya, sāmīpya, sārūpya* and *sārṣṭi*) are not so undesirable because they can be avenues of service to the Lord. Nonetheless, a pure devotee of Lord Kṛṣṇa rejects even these types of liberation; he aspires only to serve Kṛṣṇa birth after birth. He is not very interested in stopping the repetition of birth, for he simply desires to serve the Lord, even in hellish circumstances. Consequently the pure devotee hates and fears *sāyujya-mukti,* merging into the effulgence of the Lord. This merging is due to an offense committed against the transcendental loving service of the Lord, and therefore it is not at all desirable for a pure devotee.

**Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya continued, “There are two kinds of sāyujya-mukti: merging into the Brahman effulgence and merging into the personal body of the Lord. Merging into the Lord’s body is even more abominable than merging into His effulgence.”**

### Purport

According to the opinion of the Māyāvādī Vedāntists, the living entity’s ultimate success is to merge into the impersonal Brahman. The impersonal Brahman, or bodily effulgence of the Supreme Lord, is known as Brahmaloka or Siddhaloka. According to the *Brahma-saṁhitā* (5.40), *yasya prabhā prabhavato jagad-aṇḍa-koṭi:* the material universes are generated from the bodily rays of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. *Yogīs* who follow the principles of Patañjali accept the personality of the Absolute Truth, but they want to merge into the transcendental body of the Supreme Lord. That is their desire. Being the greatest authority, the Supreme Lord can easily allow many millions of living entities to merge into His body. The origin of everything is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Bhagavān, and His bodily effulgence is known as the *brahmajyoti,* Brahmaloka or Siddhaloka. Thus Brahmaloka or Siddhaloka is a place where many sparklike living entities, parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord, are assembled. Because these living entities do not wish to keep their individual existences, they are combined and allowed to remain in Brahmaloka like so many atomic particles of sunshine emanating from the sun.

The word *siddha* is very significant. *Siddha* refers to one who has realized the Brahman effulgence and who has complete knowledge that the living entity is not a material atom but a spiritual spark. This understanding is described in the *Bhagavad-gītā* as *brahma-bhūta.* In the conditioned state, the living entity is known as *jīva-bhūta,* or “the living force within matter.” *Brahma-bhūta* living entities are allowed to stay in Brahmaloka or Siddhaloka, but unfortunately they sometimes again fall into the material world because they are not engaged in devotional service. This is supported by the verse in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* beginning *ye ’nye ’ravindākṣa.* (*Bhāg.* 10.2.32) These semiliberated souls falsely claim to be liberated, but unless one engages in devotional service to the Lord, he is still materially contaminated. Therefore these living entities have been described as *vimukta-māninaḥ,* meaning that they falsely consider themselves liberated although their intelligence is not yet purified. Although these living entities undergo severe austerities to rise to the platform of Siddhaloka, they cannot remain there perpetually, for they are bereft of *ānanda* (bliss). Even though these living entities attain the *brahma-bhūta* stage and realize the Supreme Personality of Godhead through His bodily effulgence, they nonetheless fall down due to neglecting the Lord’s service. They do not properly utilize whatever little knowledge they have of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Not attaining *ānanda,* or bliss, they come down to the material world to enjoy. This is certainly a falldown for one who is actually liberated. The *bhaktas* consider such a falldown equal to achieving a place in hell.

The followers of the Patañjali *yoga* system actually want to merge into the body of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This indicates that they do not want to engage in His service despite their knowledge of Him, and thus their position is even more abominable than that of those who want to merge into the Lord’s effulgence. These *yogīs* meditate on the four-handed Viṣṇu form of the Lord in order to merge into His body. The Patañjali system describes the form of the Lord as *kleśa-karma-vipākāśayair aparāmṛṣṭaḥ puruṣa-viśeṣa īśvaraḥ:* “The Supreme Personality of Godhead is a person who does not partake of a miserable material life.” The *yogīs* accept the eternity of the Supreme Person in one of their *mantras — sa pūrveṣām api guruḥ kālānavacchedāt:* “Such a person is always supreme and is not influenced by the element of time.” The followers of the Patañjali system therefore accept the eternity of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, yet, according to them, *puruṣārtha-śūnyānāṁ pratiprasavaḥ kaivalyaṁ svarūpa-pratiṣṭhā vā citi-śaktir iti.* They believe that in the perfectional stage, the conception of *puruṣa* is vanquished. According to their description, *citi-śaktir iti.* They believe that when one becomes perfect, he cannot remain a person. This *yoga* system is therefore abominable because its final conception is impersonal. In the beginning, these *yogīs* accept the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but they ultimately give up this idea in order to become impersonal. They are most unfortunate because although they have a personal conception of the Absolute Truth, they neglect to render devotional service to the Lord and thus fall down again into the material world. As mentioned above, this idea is supported by *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* 10.2.32: *aruhya kṛcchreṇa paraṁ padaṁ tataḥ patanty adho ’nādṛta-yuṣmad-aṅghrayaḥ.* Due to neglecting the lotus feet of the Lord, these *yogīs* again fall down into the material existence (*patanty adhaḥ*)*.* Consequently this path of *yoga* is more abominable than the impersonalists’ path. This conclusion is also supported by Lord Kapiladeva in the following verse from *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (3.29.13).

Since all types of *muktis* reside at the lotus feet of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, He may be called *mukti-pada.*
