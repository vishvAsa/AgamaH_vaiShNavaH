CHAPTER FIFTEEN

The following summary of this chapter is given by Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura in his *Amṛta-pravāha-bhāṣya.* After the Ratha-yātrā festival, Śrī Advaita Ācārya Prabhu worshiped Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu with flowers and *tulasī.* Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, in return, worshiped Advaita Ācārya with the flowers and *tulasī* that remained on the offered plate and said a *mantra, yo ’si so ’si namo ’stu te* (“Whatever You are, You are — but I offer My respects unto You”). Then Advaita Ācārya Prabhu invited Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu for *prasādam.* When Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and His devotees performed the Nandotsava ceremony, the Lord dressed Himself as a cowherd boy. Thus the ceremony was very jubilant. Then the Lord and His devotees observed Vijayā-daśamī, the day of victory when Lord Rāmacandra conquered Laṅkā. The devotees all became soldiers of Lord Rāmacandra, and Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, in the ecstasy of Hanumān, manifested various transcendentally blissful activities. Thereafter, the Lord and His devotees observed various other ceremonies.

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu then asked all the devotees to return to Bengal. Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu sent Nityānanda Prabhu to Bengal for preaching and also sent Rāmadāsa, Gadādhara dāsa and several other devotees with Him. Then Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, with great humility, sent some Jagannātha *prasādam* and a cloth from Lord Jagannātha to His mother through Śrīvāsa Ṭhākura. When the Lord bade farewell to Rāghava Paṇḍita, Vāsudeva Datta, the residents of Kulīna-grāma and other devotees, He praised them for their transcendental qualities. Rāmānanda Vasu and Satyarāja Khān asked some questions, and Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu instructed them that all householder devotees must engage themselves in the service of Vaiṣṇavas exclusively devoted to chanting the holy name of the Lord. He also instructed the Vaiṣṇavas from Khaṇḍa, as well as Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya and Vidyā-vācaspati, and He praised Murāri Gupta for his firm faith in the lotus feet of Lord Rāmacandra. Considering the humble prayer of Vāsudeva Datta, He established that Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa is qualified to deliver all the conditioned souls.

Thereafter, when Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was accepting *prasādam* at the house of Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya, Sārvabhauma’s son-in-law, Amogha, created trouble in the family with his criticisms. The following morning, he was attacked by the disease of *visūcikā* (cholera). Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu very kindly saved him from death and enlivened him in chanting the holy name of Lord Kṛṣṇa.

### Translation

**With great respect, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu requested Advaita Ācārya, “Give Kṛṣṇa consciousness, devotion to Kṛṣṇa, even to the lowest of men \[caṇḍālas\].”**

### Purport

This is Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s order to all His devotees. *Kṛṣṇa-bhakti,* devotion to Kṛṣṇa, is open to everyone, even low-class men like *caṇḍālas.* One should follow this order in the disciplic succession stemming from Śrī Advaita and Nityānanda Prabhu and distribute Kṛṣṇa consciousness without discrimination throughout the world.

There are different kinds of men, beginning with the *brāhmaṇa* and going down to the lowest platform, known as *caṇḍāla.* Whatever one’s position, everyone in this Age of Kali needs to be enlightened in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That is the greatest need of the day. Everyone is acutely feeling the pangs of material existence. Even in the ranks and files of the American Senate, the pinpricks of material existence are felt, so much so that April 30, 1974, was actually set aside as Prayer Day. Thus everyone is feeling the resultant pinpricks of Kali-yuga brought about by human society’s indulging in illicit sex, meat-eating, gambling and intoxication. Now is the time for the members of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness to distribute *kṛṣṇa-bhakti* all over the world and thus follow the orders of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. The Lord has ordered everyone to become a *guru* (Cc. *Madhya* 7.128): *āmāra ājñāya guru hañā tāra’ ei deśa.* Everyone in every town and village should be enlightened by the instructions of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Kṛṣṇa consciousness should be distributed to everyone indiscriminately. In this way, the entire world will be peaceful and happy, and everyone will glorify Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, as He desires.

The word *caṇḍāla* actually refers to a dog-eater, who is considered the lowest of men. Even *caṇḍālas* can be enlightened in Kṛṣṇa consciousness due to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s benedictions. *Kṛṣṇa-bhakti* is not the monopoly of a certain caste. Everyone is eligible to receive this great benediction given by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Everyone should be given a chance to receive it and be happy.

The word *dāna,* meaning “charity,” is also significant in this verse. Whoever engages in the distribution of Kṛṣṇa consciousness is a charitable person. Professional men recite *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* and discuss *kṛṣṇa-bhakti* for an exchange of money. They cannot distribute such exalted transcendental property to everyone and anyone. Only pure devotees, who have no motive other than serving Kṛṣṇa, can give such transcendentally valuable benedictions out of charity.

### Verse text

*nityānande ājñā dila, — ‘yāha gauḍa-deśe  
anargala prema-bhakti kariha prakāśe*

### Synonyms

*nityānande* — unto Nityānanda Prabhu; *ājñā* *dila* — Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu ordered; *yāha* *gauḍa*-*deśe* — go to Gauḍa-deśa (Bengal); *anargala* — without restriction; *prema*-*bhakti* — devotional service in love of Godhead; *kariha* *prakāśe* — manifest.

### Translation

**Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu ordered Nityānanda Prabhu, “Go to Bengal and, without restriction, manifest devotional service to the Lord, Kṛṣṇa consciousness.”**

### Purport

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu thus ordered Nityānanda Prabhu to deliver all the Bengalis to devotional service. In the *Bhagavad-gītā* (9.32) the Lord says:

*māṁ hi pārtha vyapāśritya* *ye ’pi syuḥ pāpa-yonayaḥ  
striyo vaiśyās tathā śūdrās* *te ’pi yānti parāṁ gatim*

“O son of Pṛthā, those who take shelter in Me, though they be of lower birth — women, *vaiśyas* \[merchants\], and *śūdras* \[workers\] — can attain the supreme destination.” Whoever takes to Kṛṣṇa consciousness and follows the regulative principles can return home, back to Godhead.

In his *Anubhāṣya,* Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura writes, “There is a class of so-called devotees called *prākṛta-sahajiyās* who think that Nityānanda Prabhu is an ordinary human being. They have spread the news that Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu ordered Nityānanda Prabhu to return to Bengal from Orissa just to marry and beget children. This is certainly a great offense against Nityānanda Prabhu.”

Such an offense is called *pāṣaṇḍa-buddhi,* or an atheistic remark. Offenders consider Nityānanda Prabhu to be like one of them, an ordinary human being. They do not know of Nityānanda Prabhu’s identity with the *viṣṇu-tattva.* Thinking Nityānanda Prabhu to be an ordinary human being is the business of mental speculators known as *kuṇapātma-vādīs.* These people accept the material body, which is a bag of three material elements (*kuṇape tri-dhātuke*), as themselves. They think that Nityānanda Prabhu’s body was similarly material and that it was meant for sense gratification. Whoever thinks in this way is a candidate for the darkest regions of hell. Those who hanker after women and money, who are self-interested and have the mentality of merchants, can certainly discover many things with their fertile brains and speak against the authorized revealed scriptures. They also engage in some moneymaking businesses to cheat innocent people, and they try to support their business programs by making such offensive statements. Actually Nityānanda Prabhu, being the expansion of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, is the most munificent incarnation. No one should consider Him an ordinary human being or an entity like the *prajāpatis,* who were ordered by Brahmā to increase generations. Nityānanda Prabhu should not be considered instrumental for sense gratification. Although professional so-called preachers support this idea, such statements are not found in any authorized revealed scriptures. Actually there is no support for these statements made by *sahajiyās* or other professional distributors of *kṛṣṇa-bhakti.*

### Purport

Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura states that Rāghava Paṇḍita was not simply a crazy fellow suffering from some cleansing mania. He did not belong to the mundane world. In lower consciousness, accepting something to be spiritual when it is actually material is called *bhauma ijya-dhīḥ.* Rāghava Paṇḍita was an eternal servant of Kṛṣṇa, and everything he saw was related to the service of the Lord. He was always absorbed in the transcendental thought of how he could always serve Kṛṣṇa with everything. Sometimes neophytes, devotees on the lower platform, try to imitate Rāghava Paṇḍita on the platform of material purity and impurity. Such imitation will not help anyone. As explained in the *Caitanya-caritāmṛta* (*Antya-līlā* 4.174), *bhadrābhadra-vastu-jñāna nāhika ‘prākṛte.’* On the transcendental platform there is no higher or lower, pure or impure. On the material platform, distinction is made between good and bad, but on the spiritual platform everything is of the same quality.

*‘dvaite’ bhadrābhadra-jñāna, saba — ‘manodharma’  
‘ei bhāla, ei manda’, — ei saba ‘bhrama’*

“In the material world, conceptions of good and bad are all mental speculations. Therefore, saying ‘This is good and that is bad’ is all a mistake.” (Cc. *Antya* 4.176)

### Purport

*Śrī Kṛṣṇa-vijaya* is a book of poems considered to be the first poetry book written in Bengal. Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura states that this book was begun in the year 1395 Śakābda (A.D. 1473). After seven years, it was completed (in 1402 Śakābda). This book was written in plain language, and even half-educated Bengalis and women could read it very clearly. Even ordinary men with little knowledge of the alphabet could read this book and understand it. Its language is not very ornamental, and sometimes the poetry is not very sweet to hear. Although according to the sonnet style each line should contain fourteen syllables, there are sometimes sixteen, twelve or thirteen syllables in his verse. Many words used in those days could be understood only by local inhabitants, yet this book is still so popular that no bookstore is complete without it. It is very valuable for those who are interested in advancing in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

Śrī Guṇarāja Khān was one of the topmost Vaiṣṇavas, and he translated the Tenth and Eleventh Cantos of *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* for the understanding of the common man. The book *Śrī Kṛṣṇa-vijaya* was highly praised by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and it is very valuable for all Vaiṣṇavas. Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura gives a genealogical table and family history of Guṇarāja Khān. When a Bengali emperor named Ādiśūra first came from Kānyakubja, or Kānauj, he brought with him five *brāhmaṇas* and five *kāyasthas.* Since the king is supposed to be accompanied by his associates, the *brāhmaṇas* accompanied the King to help him in higher spiritual matters. The *kāyasthas* were to render other services. In the northern Indian high country, the *kāyasthas* are accepted as *śūdras,* but in Bengal the *kāyasthas* are considered among the higher castes. It is a fact that the *kāyasthas* came to Bengal from northern India, specifically from Kānyakubja, or Kānauj. Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura says that the *kāyasthas* who came from Kānyakubja were high-class men. Of them, Daśaratha Vasu was a great personality, and the thirteenth generation of his family included Guṇarāja Khān.

His real name was Mālādhara Vasu, but the title Khān was given to him by the Emperor of Bengal. Thus he became known as Guṇarāja Khān. Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura gives the following genealogical table of Guṇarāja Khān: (1) Daśaratha Vasu; (2) Kuśala; (3) Śubhaśaṅkara; (4) Haṁsa; (5) Śaktirāma (Bāgāṇḍā), Muktirāma (Māinagara) and Alaṅkāra (Baṅgaja); (6) Dāmodara; (7) Anantarāma; (8) Guṇīnāyaka and Vīṇānāyaka. The twelfth generation included Bhagīratha, and the thirteenth Mālādhara Vasu, or Guṇarāja Khān. Śrī Guṇarāja Khān had fourteen sons, of whom the second son, Lakṣmīnātha Vasu, received the title Satyarāja Khān. His son was Śrī Rāmānanda Vasu; therefore Rāmānanda Vasu belonged to the fifteenth generation. Guṇarāja Khān was a very well known and wealthy man. His palace, fort and temples are still existing, and from these we can deduce that the opulence of Guṇarāja Khān was certainly very great. Śrī Guṇarāja Khān never cared for the artificial aristocracy introduced by Ballāl Sena.

### Translation

**Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu replied, “Whoever chants the holy name of Kṛṣṇa just once is worshipable and is the topmost human being.**

### Purport

Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura says that a person who simply chants the holy name of Kṛṣṇa once becomes perfect and should be regarded as a Vaiṣṇava. This is confirmed by Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī in his *Upadeśāmṛta* (5): *kṛṣṇeti yasya giri taṁ manasādriyeta.* With such faith in the holy name one may begin a life of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. But an ordinary person cannot chant the holy name of Kṛṣṇa with such faith. One should accept the holy name of Kṛṣṇa to be identical with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Transcendence Himself. As the *Padma Purāṇa* states, “The holy name of Kṛṣṇa is identical with Kṛṣṇa and is like a *cintāmaṇi* gem, a touchstone*.* That name is Kṛṣṇa personified in sound and is therefore perfectly transcendental and eternally liberated from material contamination.” Thus one should understand that the name “Kṛṣṇa” and Kṛṣṇa Himself are identical. Having such faith, one must continue to chant the holy name.

When one is situated on the neophyte platform, one cannot understand the devotional ingredients of a pure, unalloyed devotee. However, when the novice engages in devotional service — especially in Deity worship — and follows the order of a bona fide spiritual master, he is a pure devotee. Anyone can take advantage of hearing about Kṛṣṇa consciousness from such a devotee and thus gradually become purified. In other words, any devotee who believes that the holy name of the Lord is identical with the Lord is a pure devotee, even though he may be in the neophyte stage. By his association, others may also become Vaiṣṇavas.

One is known as a materialistic devotee if he simply worships the Deity of Hari with faith but does not show proper respect to the devotees and to others. This is stated in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (11.2.47):

*arcāyām eva haraye* *pūjāṁ yaḥ śraddhayehate  
na tad-bhakteṣu cānyeṣu* *sa bhaktaḥ prākṛtaḥ smṛtaḥ*

Yet even by associating with such a neophyte devotee, one can become a devotee also. When Lord Caitanya was teaching Sanātana Gosvāmī, He said:

*śraddhāvān jana haya bhakti-adhikārī  
‘uttama’, ‘madhyama’, ‘kaniṣṭha’ — śraddhā-anusārī*

*yāhāra komala-śraddhā, se ‘kaniṣṭha’ jana  
krame krame teṅho bhakta ha-ibe ‘uttama’*

*rati-prema-tāratamye bhakta-taratama*

“A person who has attained firm faith is a real candidate for advancing in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. According to the faith, there are first-class, second-class and neophyte devotees. One who has preliminary faith is called a *kaniṣṭha-adhikārī,* or a neophyte. The neophyte, however, can become an advanced devotee if he strictly follows the regulative principles set down by the spiritual master. Therefore it is on the basis of faith and attachment to Kṛṣṇa that one can judge who is a *madhyama-adhikārī* or an *uttama-adhikārī.*” (Cc. *Madhya* 22.64, 69, 71)

It is thus concluded that even a neophyte devotee is superior to the *karmīs* and *jñānīs* because he has full faith in chanting the holy name of the Lord. A *karmī* or a *jñānī,* regardless of his greatness, has no faith in Lord Viṣṇu, His holy name or His devotional service. One may be advanced religiously, but if he is not trained in devotional service, he has very little credit on the transcendental platform. Even a neophyte devotee engaged in Deity worship in accordance with the regulations set forth by the spiritual master is in a position superior to that of the fruitive worker and speculative philosopher.

*“eka kṛṣṇa-nāme kare sarva-pāpa kṣaya  
nava-vidhā bhakti pūrṇa nāma haite haya*

### Synonyms

*eka* *kṛṣṇa*-*nāme* — one holy name of Kṛṣṇa; *kare* — can do; *sarva*-*pāpa* — of all sinful reactions; *kṣaya* — destruction; *nava*-*vidhā* — nine processes; *bhakti* — of devotional service; *pūrṇa* — complete; *nāma* *haite* — simply by chanting the holy name; *haya* — are.

### Translation

**“Simply by chanting the holy name of Kṛṣṇa once, a person is relieved from all the reactions of a sinful life. One can complete the nine processes of devotional service simply by chanting the holy name.**

### Purport

The nine types of devotional service are mentioned in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (7.5.23):

*śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ* *smaraṇaṁ pāda-sevanam  
arcanaṁ vandanaṁ dāsyaṁ* *sakhyam ātma-nivedanam*

*iti puṁsārpitā viṣṇau* *bhaktiś cen nava-lakṣaṇā  
kriyeta bhagavaty addhā* *tan manye ’dhītam uttamam*

“The process of devotional service entails hearing, chanting and remembering the holy name, form, pastimes, qualities and entourage of the Lord, offering service according to the time, place and performer, worshiping the Deity, offering prayers, always considering oneself the eternal servant of Kṛṣṇa, making friends with Him and dedicating everything unto Him. These nine items of devotional service, when directly offered to Kṛṣṇa, constitute the highest attainment of life. This is the verdict of the revealed scriptures.”

As for being freed from all sinful reactions by chanting the holy name of Kṛṣṇa only once, one must chant the holy name without committing any offenses. Then chanting one name is sufficient to rescue a living being from all sinful reactions. Such a person who chants the holy name of the Lord offenselessly is very important and woshipable. Indeed, the nine devotional processes, beginning with *śravaṇa* and *kīrtana,* can all be attained at once if one simply chants the holy name of the Lord offenselessly.

In this regard, Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī states in his book *Bhakti-sandarbha* (173): *yadyapi anyā bhaktiḥ kalau kartavyā, tadā; kīrtanākhya-bhakti-saṁyogenaiva.* Out of the nine processes of devotional service, *kīrtana* is very important. Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī therefore instructs that the other processes, such as *arcana, vandana, dāsya* and *sakhya,* should be executed, but they must be preceded and followed by *kīrtana,* the chanting of the holy name. We have therefore introduced this system in all of our centers. *Arcana, ārati, bhoga* offering, Deity dressing and decoration are all preceded and followed by the chanting of the holy name of the Lord — Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare.

Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī explains *dīkṣā* in his *Bhakti-sandarbha* (283):

*divyaṁ jñānaṁ yato dadyāt* *kuryāt pāpasya saṅkṣayam  
tasmāt dīkṣeti sā proktā* *deśikais tattva-kovidaiḥ*

“*Dīkṣā* is the process by which one can awaken his transcendental knowledge and vanquish all reactions caused by sinful activity. A person expert in the study of the revealed scriptures knows this process as *dīkṣā.*” The regulative principles of *dīkṣā* are explained in the *Hari-bhakti-vilāsa* (2.3-4) and the *Bhakti-sandarbha* (283). As stated:

*dvijānām anupetānāṁ* *svakarmādhyayanādiṣu  
yathādhikāro nāstīha* *syāc copanayanād anu  
tathātrādīkṣitānāṁ tu* *mantra-devārcanādiṣu  
nādhikāro ’sty ataḥ kuryād* *ātmānaṁ śiva-saṁstutam*

“Even though born in a *brāhmaṇa* family, one cannot engage in Vedic rituals without being initiated and having a sacred thread. Although born in a *brāhmaṇa* family, one becomes a *brāhmaṇa* only after initiation and the sacred thread ceremony. Unless one is initiated as a *brāhmaṇa,* one cannot worship the holy name properly.”

According to the Vaiṣṇava regulative principles, one must be initiated as a *brāhmaṇa.* The *Hari-bhakti-vilāsa* (2.6) quotes the following injunction from the *Viṣṇu-yāmala:*

*adīkṣitasya vāmoru* *kṛtaṁ sarvaṁ nirarthakam  
paśu-yonim avāpnoti* *dīkṣā-virahito janaḥ*

“ ‘Unless one is initiated by a bona fide spiritual master, all his devotional activities are useless. A person who is not properly initiated can descend again into the animal species.’ ”

*Hari-bhakti-vilāsa* (2.10) further quotes:

*ato guruṁ praṇamyaivaṁ* *sarva-svaṁ vinivedya ca  
gṛhṇīyād vaiṣṇavaṁ mantraṁ* *dīkṣā-pūrvaṁ vidhānataḥ*

“ ‘It is the duty of every human being to surrender to a bona fide spiritual master. Giving him everything — body, mind and intelligence — one must take Vaiṣṇava initiation from him.’ ”

The *Bhakti-sandarbha* (298) gives the following quotation from the *Tattva-sāgara:*

*yathā kāñcanatāṁ yāti* *kāṁsyaṁ rasa-vidhānataḥ  
tathā dīkṣā-vidhānena* *dvijatvaṁ jāyate nṛṇām*

“ ‘By chemical manipulation, bell metal is turned into gold when touched by mercury; similarly, when a person is properly initiated, he can acquire the qualities of a *brāhmaṇa.*’ ”

The *Hari-bhakti-vilāsa* (17.11-12), in discussing the *puraścaryā* process, quotes the following verses from the *Agastya-saṁhitā:*

*pūjā traikālikī nityaṁ* *japas tarpaṇam eva ca  
homo brāhmaṇa-bhuktiś ca* *puraścaraṇam ucyate*

*guror labdhasya mantrasya* *prasādena yathā-vidhi  
pañcāṅgopāsanā-siddhyai* *puraś caitad vidhīyate*

“ ‘In the morning, afternoon and evening one should worship the Deity, chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra,* offer oblations, perform a fire sacrifice and feed the *brāhmaṇas.* These five activities constitute *puraścaryā.* To attain full success when taking initiation from the spiritual master, one should first perform these *puraścaryā* processes.’ ”

The word *puraḥ* means “before,” and *caryā* means “activities.” Due to the necessity of these activities, we do not immediately initiate disciples in the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. For six months, a candidate for initiation must first attend *ārati* and classes in the *śāstras,* practice the regulative principles and associate with other devotees. When one is actually advanced in the *puraścaryā-vidhi,* he is recommended by the local temple president for initiation. It is not that anyone can be suddenly initiated without meeting the requirements. When one is further advanced by chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra* sixteen rounds daily, following the regulative principles and attending classes, he receives the sacred thread (brahminical recognition) after the second six months.

In the *Hari-bhakti-vilāsa* (17.4-5, 7) it is stated:

*vinā yena na siddhaḥ syān* *mantro varṣa-śatair api  
kṛtena yena labhate* *sādhako vāñchitaṁ phalam*

*puraścaraṇa-sampanno* *mantro hi phala-dhāyakaḥ  
ataḥ puraṣkriyāṁ kuryāt* *mantra-vit siddhi-kaṅkṣayā*

*puraṣkriyā hi mantrāṇāṁ* *pradhānaṁ vīryam ucyate  
vīrya-hīno yathā dehī* *sarva-karmasu na kṣamaḥ  
puraścaraṇa-hīno hi* *tathā mantraḥ prakīrtitaḥ*

“Without performing the *puraścaryā* activities, one cannot become perfect even by chanting this *mantra* for hundreds of years. But one who has undergone the *puraścaryā-vidhi* process can attain success very easily. If one wishes to perfect his initiation, he must first undergo the *puraścaryā* activities. The *puraścaryā* process is the life force by which one is successful in chanting the *mantra.* Without the life force, one cannot do anything; similarly, without the life force of *puraścaryā-vidhi,* no *mantra* can be perfected.”

In his *Bhakti-sandarbha* (283-84), Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī describes the importance of Deity worship and initiation (*dīkṣā*) as follows:

*yadyapi śrī-bhāgavata-mate pañcarātrādi-vat arcana-mārgasya āvaśyakatvaṁ nāsti, tad vināpi śaraṇāpattyādīnām ekatareṇāpi puruṣārtha-siddher abhihitatvāt, tathāpi śrī-nāradādi-vartmānusaradbhiḥ śrī-bhagavatā saha sambandha-viśeṣaṁ dīkṣā-vidhānena śrī-guru-caraṇa-sampāditaṁ cikīrṣadbhiḥ kṛtāyāṁ dīkṣāyām arcanam avaśyaṁ kriyetaiva.*

*yadyapi svarūpato nāsti, tathāpi prāyaḥ svabhāvato dehādi-sambandhena kadarya-śīlānāṁ vikṣipta-cittānāṁ janānāṁ tat-tat-saṅkocī-karaṇāya śrīmad-ṛṣi-prabhṛtibhir atrārcana-mārge kvacit kvacit kācit kācin maryādā sthāpitāsti*.

“It is *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam’s* opinion that the process of Deity worship is not actually necessary, just as the specific prescriptions of the *Pañcarātra* and other scriptures do not have to be followed. The *Bhāgavatam* enjoins that even without practicing Deity worship one can achieve the complete success of human life by any of the other devotional processes, such as simply offering oneself at the Lord’s feet for His protection. Nonetheless, Vaiṣṇavas following the path of Śrī Nārada and his successors endeavor to establish a personal relationship with the Lord by receiving the grace of a bona fide spiritual master through initiation, and in this tradition the devotees are obliged at the time of initiation to begin engaging in Deity worship.

“Although Deity worship is not essential, the material conditioning of most candidates for devotional service requires that they engage in this activity. When we consider their bodily and mental conditions, we find that the character of such candidates is impure and their minds are agitated. Therefore, to rectify this material conditioning the great sage Nārada and others have at different times recommended various kinds of regulations for Deity worship.”

Similarly, the *Rāmārcana-candrikā* states:

*vinaiva dīkṣāṁ viprendra* *puraścaryāṁ vinaiva hi  
vinaiva nyāsa-vidhinā* *japa-mātreṇa siddhi-dā*

“O best of the *brāhmaṇas,* even without initiation, preliminary purification or acceptance of the renounced order, one can attain perfection in devotional service simply by chanting the Lord’s holy name.”

In other words, the chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra* is so powerful that it does not depend on official initiation, but if one is initiated and engages in *pañcarātra-vidhi* (Deity worship), his Kṛṣṇa consciousness will awaken very soon, and his identification with the material world will be vanquished. The more one is freed from material identification, the more one can realize that the spirit soul is qualitatively as good as the Supreme Soul. At such a time, when one is situated on the absolute platform, one can understand that the holy name of the Lord and the Lord Himself are identical. At that stage of realization, the holy name of the Lord, the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra,* cannot be identified with any material sound. If one accepts the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra* as a material vibration, he falls down. One should worship and chant the holy name of the Lord by accepting it as the Lord Himself. One should therefore be initiated properly according to revealed scriptures under the direction of a bona fide spiritual master. Although chanting the holy name is good for both the conditioned and liberated soul, it is especially beneficial to the conditioned soul because by chanting it one is liberated. When a person who chants the holy name is liberated, he attains the ultimate perfection by returning home, back to Godhead. In the words of *Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta* (*Ādi* 7.73):

*kṛṣṇa-mantra haite habe saṁsāra-mocana  
kṛṣṇa-nāma haite pābe kṛṣṇera caraṇa*

“Simply by chanting the holy name of Kṛṣṇa one can obtain freedom from material existence. Indeed, simply by chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra* one will be able to see the lotus feet of the Lord.”

The offenseless chanting of the holy name does not depend on the initiation process. Although initiation may depend on *puraścaryā* or *puraścaraṇa,* the actual chanting of the holy name does not depend on *puraścaryā-vidhi,* or the regulative principles. If one chants the holy name even once without committing an offense, he attains all success. During the chanting of the holy name, the tongue must work. Simply by chanting the holy name, one is immediately delivered. The tongue is *sevonmukha-jihvā* — it is controlled by service. One whose tongue is engaged in tasting material things and also talking about them cannot use the tongue for absolute realization.

*ataḥ śrī-kṛṣṇa-nāmādi* *na bhaved grāhyam indriyaiḥ  
sevonmukhe hi jihvādau* *svayam eva sphuraty adaḥ*

“With the material senses one cannot understand the transcendental holy name of the Lord or His form, activities and pastimes. But when one actually engages in devotional service, utilizing the tongue, the Lord is revealed.” As it is said in the *Caitanya-caritāmṛta* (*Madhya* 17.134):

*ataeva kṛṣṇera ‘nāma’, ‘deha’, ‘vilāsa’,  
prākṛtendriya-grāhya nahe, haya sva-prakāśa*

“The holy name of Kṛṣṇa, His body and His pastimes cannot be understood by the blunt material senses. They are manifested independently.”

### Translation

**“ ‘The holy name of Lord Kṛṣṇa is an attractive feature for many saintly, liberal people. It is the annihilator of all sinful reactions and is so powerful that, save for the dumb who cannot chant it, it is readily available to everyone, including the lowest type of man, the caṇḍāla. The holy name of Kṛṣṇa is the controller of the opulence of liberation, and it is identical with Kṛṣṇa. When a person simply chants the holy name with his tongue, immediate effects are produced. Chanting the holy name does not depend on initiation, pious activities or the puraścaryā regulative principles generally observed before initiation. The holy name does not wait for any of these activities. It is self-sufficient.’ ”**

**Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu then finally advised, “One who is chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra is understood to be a Vaiṣṇava; therefore you should offer all respects to him.”**

### Purport

In his *Upadeśāmṛta,* Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī states: *kṛṣṇeti yasya giri taṁ manasādriyeta dīkṣāsti cet praṇatibhiś ca bhajantam īśam.* An advanced devotee should respect a person who has been initiated by a bona fide spiritual master and who is situated on the transcendental platform, chanting the holy name with faith and obeisances and following the instructions of the spiritual master. Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura comments that serving Vaiṣṇavas is most important for householders. Whether a Vaiṣṇava is properly initiated or not is not a subject for consideration. One may be initiated and yet contaminated by the Māyāvāda philosophy, but a person who chants the holy name of the Lord offenselessly will not be so contaminated. A properly initiated Vaiṣṇava may be imperfect, but one who chants the holy name of the Lord offenselessly is all-perfect. Although he may apparently be a neophyte, he still has to be considered a pure, unalloyed Vaiṣṇava. It is the duty of the householder to offer respects to such an unalloyed Vaiṣṇava. This is Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s instruction.

Unless Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya Mahāprabhu discloses the fact, no one can understand who is actually a great devotee of the Lord engaged in His service. It is therefore said in the *Caitanya-caritāmṛta* (*Madhya* 23.39), *tāṅra vākya, kriyā, mudrā vijñeha nā bujhaya:* even the most perfect and learned scholar cannot understand a Vaiṣṇava’s activities. A Vaiṣṇava may be engaged in governmental service or in a professional business so that externally one cannot understand his position. Internally, however, he may be a *nitya-siddha* Vaiṣṇava — that is, an eternally liberated Vaiṣṇava. Externally Mukunda dāsa was a royal physician, but internally he was the most liberated *paramahaṁsa* devotee. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu knew this very well, but ordinary men could not understand it, for the activities and plans of a Vaiṣṇava cannot be understood by ordinary men. However, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and His representative understand everything about a devotee, even though the devotee may externally pretend to be an ordinary householder and professional businessman.

### Purport

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu set forth three duties for three different people. Mukunda was to earn money and follow the religious principles, whereas Narahari was to remain with the Lord’s devotees, and Raghunandana was to engage in the Lord’s service in the temple. Thus one person worships in the temple, another earns money honestly by executing his professional duty, and yet another preaches Kṛṣṇa consciousness with the devotees. Apparently these three types of service appear separate, but actually they are not. When Kṛṣṇa or Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is the center, everyone can engage in different activities for the service of the Lord. That is the verdict of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

### Verse text

*‘dāru-brahma’-rūpe — sākṣāt śrī-puruṣottama  
bhāgīrathī hana sākṣāt ‘jala-brahma’-sama*

### Synonyms

*dāru*-*brahma*-*rūpe* — in the form of Brahman as wood; *sākṣāt* — directly; *śrī*-*puruṣottama* — Lord Jagannātha; *bhāgīrathī* — the river Ganges; *hana* — is; *sākṣāt* — directly; *jala*-*brahma*-*sama* — the Supreme in the form of water.

### Translation

**“Lord Jagannātha is the Supreme Lord Himself in the form of wood, and the river Ganges is the Supreme Lord Himself in the form of water.**

### Purport

The *Vedas* enjoin, *sarvaṁ khalv idaṁ brahma:* everything is the energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Supreme Brahman or Parambrahma. *Parasya brahmaṇaḥ śaktis tathedam akhilaṁ jagat:* everything is a manifestation of the energy of the Supreme Brahman. Since the energy and energetic are identical, actually everything is Kṛṣṇa, Parambrahma. In the *Bhagavad-gītā* (9.4) Lord Kṛṣṇa confirms this:

*mayā tatam idaṁ sarvaṁ* *jagad avyakta-mūrtinā  
mat-sthāni sarva-bhūtāni* *na cāhaṁ teṣv avasthitaḥ*

“By Me, in My unmanifested form, this entire universe is pervaded. All beings are in Me, but I am not in them.”

Kṛṣṇa is spread throughout the whole universe in His impersonal form. Since everything is a manifestation of the Lord’s energy, the Lord can manifest Himself through any energy. In this age, the Lord is manifest through wood as Lord Jagannātha, and He is manifest through water as the river Ganges. Therefore Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu ordered the two brothers — Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya and Vidyā-vācaspati — to worship Lord Jagannātha and the river Ganges.

### Purport

The word *prabhu,* or master, indicates that the Lord is to be continuously served by His devotee. The original *prabhu* is the Lord, Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Nonetheless, there are many devotees attached to Lord Rāmacandra, and Murāri Gupta is a vivid example of such unalloyed devotion. He never agreed to give up Lord Rāmacandra’s worship, not even upon Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s request. Such is the chastity of devotional service, as stated in the *Antya-līlā* of *Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta* (4.46-47):

*sei bhakta dhanya, ye nā chāḍe prabhura caraṇa

In a firm relationship with the Lord, the devotee does not give up the Lord’s service under any circumstance. As far as the Lord Himself is concerned, if the devotee chooses to leave, the Lord brings him back again, dragging him by the hair.

### Purport

Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura gives the following commentary on this verse. In the Western countries, Christians believe that Lord Jesus Christ, their spiritual master, appeared in order to eradicate all the sins of his disciples. To this end, Lord Jesus Christ appeared and disappeared. Here, however, we find Śrī Vāsudeva Datta Ṭhākura and Śrīla Haridāsa Ṭhākura to be many millions of times more advanced than even Lord Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ relieved only his followers from all sinful reactions, but Vāsudeva Datta is here prepared to accept the sins of everyone in the universe. So the comparative position of Vāsudeva Datta is millions of times better than that of Lord Jesus Christ. A Vaiṣṇava is so liberal that he is prepared to risk everything to rescue the conditioned souls from material existence. Śrīla Vāsudeva Datta Ṭhākura is universal love itself, for he was willing to sacrifice everything and fully engage in the service of the Supreme Lord.

Śrīla Vāsudeva Datta knew very well that Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was the original Personality of Godhead, Transcendence itself, above the material conception of illusion and *māyā.* Lord Jesus Christ certainly finished the sinful reactions of his followers by his mercy, but that does not mean he completely delivered them from the pangs of material existence. A person may be relieved from sins once, but it is a practice among Christians to confess sins and yet commit them again. By getting freed from sins and again engaging in them, one cannot attain freedom from the pangs of material existence. A diseased person may go to a physician for relief, but after he leaves the hospital he may again be infected due to his unclean habits. Thus material existence continues. Śrīla Vāsudeva Datta wanted to completely relieve the conditioned souls from material existence so that they would no longer have an opportunity to commit sinful acts. This is the significant difference between Śrīla Vāsudeva Datta and Lord Jesus Christ. It is a great offense to receive pardon for sins and then commit the same sins again. Such an offense is more dangerous than the sinful activity itself. Vāsudeva Datta was so liberal that he requested Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu to transfer all offensive activity upon him so the conditioned souls would be purified and go back home, back to Godhead. This prayer was certainly without duplicity.

Vāsudeva Datta’s example is unique not only within this world but within the universe. It is beyond the conception of fruitive actors or the speculation of mundane philosophers. Due to being illusioned by the external energy and due to a poor fund of knowledge, people tend to envy one another. Because of this they are entangled in fruitive activity, and they try to escape this fruitive activity by mental speculation. Consequently neither *karmīs* nor *jñānīs* are purified. In the words of Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Ṭhākura, they are *kukarmīs* and *kujñānīs* — bad fruitive actors and bad speculators. The Māyāvādīs and *karmīs* should therefore turn their attention to the magnanimous Vāsudeva Datta, who wanted to suffer for others in a hellish condition. No one should consider Vāsudeva Datta a mundane philanthropist or welfare worker. Nor was he interested in merging into the Brahman effulgence or in gaining material honor or reputation. He was far, far above philanthropists, philosophers and fruitive actors. He was the most exalted personality to ever show mercy to the conditioned souls. This is not an exaggeration of his transcendental qualities. It is perfectly true. Actually, there cannot be any comparison to Vāsudeva Datta. As the perfect Vaiṣṇava, he was *para-duḥkha-duḥkhī,* very much aggrieved to see others suffer. The entire world is purified simply by the appearance of such a great devotee. Indeed, by his transcendental presence the whole world is glorified and all conditioned souls are also glorified. As Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura confirms, Vāsudeva Datta is the ideal devotee of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu:

*gaurāṅgera saṅgi-gaṇe,* *nitya-siddha kari’ māne,  
se yāya vrajendrasuta-pāśa*

One who executes Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s mission must be considered eternally liberated. He is a transcendental person and does not belong to this material world. Such a devotee, engaging in the deliverance of the total population, is as magnanimous as Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu Himself.

*namo mahā-vadānyāya* *kṛṣṇa-prema-pradāya te  
kṛṣṇāya kṛṣṇa-caitanya-* *nāmne gaura-tviṣe namaḥ*

Such a personality factually represents Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu because his heart is always filled with compassion for all conditioned souls.

### Translation

**“Whosever welfare you desire immediately becomes a Vaiṣṇava, and Kṛṣṇa delivers all Vaiṣṇavas from the reactions of their past sinful activities.**

### Purport

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu here informed Vāsudeva Datta that since Kṛṣṇa is all-powerful, He can immediately deliver all conditioned souls from material existence. In essence, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, “You desire the liberation of all kinds of living entities without discrimination. You are very anxious for their good fortune, and I say that simply by your prayer all living entities within the universe can be liberated. You do not even have to take up the burden of their sinful activities. Thus there is no need for you to suffer for their sinful lives. Whoever receives your compassion becomes a Vaiṣṇava immediately, and Kṛṣṇa delivers all Vaiṣṇavas from the reactions to their past sinful activities.” Kṛṣṇa also promises this in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (18.66):

*sarva-dharmān parityajya* *mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja  
ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo* *mokṣayiṣyāmi mā śucaḥ*

“Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. I shall deliver you from all sinful reactions. Do not fear.”

As soon as one fully surrenders to Kṛṣṇa, he becomes a Vaiṣṇava. In this verse from the *Bhagavad-gītā* Kṛṣṇa promises to relieve His devotee from all the reactions to sinful life. It is a fact that a fully surrendered Vaiṣṇava is completely out of the range of material infection. This is to say that he does not suffer the results of his previous pious or impious actions. Unless one is freed from sinful life, one cannot become a Vaiṣṇava. In other words, if one is a Vaiṣṇava, his sinful life is certainly ended. According to the *Padma Purāṇa:*

*aprārabdha-phalaṁ pāpaṁ* *kūṭaṁ bījaṁ phalonmukham  
krameṇaiva pralīyeta* *viṣṇu-bhakti-ratātmanām*

“There are different stages of dormant reactions to sinful activities to be observed in a sinful life. Sinful reactions may be just waiting to take effect \[*phalonmukha*\], reactions may be still further dormant \[*kūṭa*\], or the reactions may be in a seedlike state \[*bīja*\]. In any case, all types of sinful reactions are vanquished one after another if a person engages in the devotional service of Lord Viṣṇu.”

The name Virajā indicates a marginal position between the spiritual and material worlds, but the Virajā River is not under the control of the material energy.

कोटि-कामधेनु-पतिर छागी यैछे मरे ।

### Verse text

*koṭi-kāmadhenu-patira chāgī yaiche mare  
ṣaḍ-aiśvarya-pati kṛṣṇera māyā kibā kare?*

### Synonyms

*koṭi* — of millions; *kāma*-*dhenu* — of desire cows; *patira* — of the master; *chāgī* — one she-goat; *yaiche* — as; *mare* — dies; *ṣaṭ*-*aiśvarya*-*pati* — the master of six opulences; *kṛṣṇera* — of Kṛṣṇa; *māyā* — external energy; *kibā* — what; *kare* — can do.

### Translation

**“If a person possessing millions of wish-fulfilling cows loses one she-goat, he does not consider the loss. Kṛṣṇa owns all six opulences in full. If the entire material energy is destroyed, what does He lose?”**

### Purport

Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura, in clarifying verses 171-179, states that the meaning of these stanzas is very simple but that the purport is a little difficult to understand. Generally, the conditioned souls forget Kṛṣṇa when they are enticed by the material, external energy. Consequently they are called *kṛṣṇa-bahirmukha,* bereft of their relationship with Kṛṣṇa. When such a living entity comes under the jurisdiction of the material energy, he is sent into one of the innumerable material universes created by the material energy to give a chance to conditioned souls to fulfill their desires in the material world. Being very eager to enjoy the fruits of their activities, conditioned souls become involved in the actions and reactions of material life. Consequently they enjoy and suffer the results of *karma.* However, if a conditioned soul becomes Kṛṣṇa conscious, the *karma* of his pious and impious activities is completely destroyed. Simply by becoming a devotee, one is freed of all the reactions of *karma.* Similarly, simply by the desire of a devotee, a conditioned soul can attain liberation and transcend the results of *karma.* Since everyone can be liberated in this way, one may conclude that it is according to the sweet will of the devotee whether the material world exists or does not exist. Ultimately, however, it is not the sweet will of the devotee but the will of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who, if He so desires, can completely annihilate the material creation. There is no loss on His part. The owner of millions of cows does not consider the loss of one she-goat. Similarly, Lord Kṛṣṇa is the proprietor of both the material and spiritual universes. The material world constitutes only one-fourth of His creative energy. If, according to the desire of the devotee, the Lord completely destroys the creation, He is so opulent that He will not mind the loss.

### Translation

**Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu continued, “ ‘O my Lord, O unconquerable one, O master of all potencies, please exhibit Your internal potency to conquer the nescience of all moving and inert living entities. Due to nescience, they accept all kinds of faulty things, thus provoking a fearful situation. O Lord, please show Your glories! You can do this very easily, for Your internal potency is beyond the external potency, and You are the reservoir of all opulence. You are also the demonstrator of the material potency. You are also always engaged in Your pastimes in the spiritual world, where You exhibit Your reserved, internal potency, and sometimes You exhibit the external potency by glancing over it. Thus You manifest Your pastimes. The Vedas confirm Your two potencies and accept both types of pastimes due to them.’ ”**

### Purport

This verse is taken from *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (10.87.14). It is from the prayers of the *śruti-gaṇa,* the personified *Vedas,* who glorify the Lord.

The almighty Personality of Godhead has three potencies — internal, external and marginal. The conditioned souls, who are condemned due to their forgetfulness of the Lord, are put under the control of the external potency when she creates the material world. The three modes of material nature keep the living entity in a constant state of fear (*bhayaṁ dvitīyābhiniveśataḥ*)*.* The conditioned soul is always fearful due to being controlled by the external potency; therefore the conditioned soul should always pray to the almighty Lord to conquer the external potency (*māyā*) so that she will no longer manifest her powers, which bind all living entities, moving and inert. By praying in this way one will become eligible to remain constantly in the association of the Lord, thus fulfilling the mission of going back home, back to Godhead.

According to etiquette, things used by Kṛṣṇa should not be used by anyone else. Similarly, things used by the spiritual master should also not be used by anyone else. That is etiquette. Whatever is used by Kṛṣṇa or the spiritual master is worshipable. In particular, their sitting or eating places should not be used by anyone else. A devotee must be very careful to observe this.

### Purport

This is a quotation from *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (11.6.46). In the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement, the chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra,* the dancing in ecstasy and the eating of the remnants of food offered to the Lord are very, very important. One may be illiterate or incapable of understanding the philosophy, but if he partakes of these three items, he will certainly be liberated without delay.

This verse was spoken by Uddhava to Lord Kṛṣṇa. This was during the time when the *Uddhava-gītā* was spoken. At that time there was some disturbance in Dvārakā, and Lord Kṛṣṇa decided to leave the material world and enter the spiritual world. Uddhava could understand the situation, and he talked with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The verse quoted above is an excerpt from their conversation. Śrī Kṛṣṇa’s pastimes in this material world are called *prakaṭa-līlā* (manifested pastimes), and His pastimes in the spiritual world are called *aprakaṭa-līlā* (unmanifested pastimes). By “unmanifested” we mean that they are not present before our eyes. It is not that Lord Kṛṣṇa’s pastimes are nonexistent. They are going on exactly as the sun is shining perpetually, but when the sun is present before our eyes, we call it daytime (manifest), and when it is not present, we call it night (unmanifest). Those who are above the jurisdiction of night are always in the spiritual world, where the Lord’s pastimes are constantly manifest to them. As the *Brahma-saṁhitā* (5.37-38) confirms:

*ānanda-cinmaya-rasa-pratibhāvitābhis *
 *tābhir ya eva nija-rūpatayā kalābhiḥ  
goloka eva nivasaty akhilātma-bhūto *
 *govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi*

*premāñjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena *
 *santaḥ sadaiva hṛdayeṣu vilokayanti  
yaṁ śyāmasundaram acintya-guṇa-svarūpaṁ *
 *govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi*

“I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, who resides in His own realm, Goloka, with Rādhā, who resembles His own spiritual figure and who embodies the ecstatic potency \[*hlādinī*\]*.* Their companions are Her confidantes, who embody extensions of Her bodily form and who are imbued and permeated with ever-blissful spiritual *rasa.* I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, who is Śyāmasundara, Kṛṣṇa Himself, with inconceivable innumerable attributes, whom the pure devotees see in their heart of hearts with the eye of devotion tinged with the salve of love.”

### Purport

In Dvārakā, Lord Kṛṣṇa had eighteen mothers — Devakī, Rohiṇī and others. Besides these was His foster mother, Yaśodā, in Vṛndāvana. Lord Kṛṣṇa also had many uncles. As stated by Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī in his *Bṛhat Śrī Śrī Rādhā-kṛṣṇa-gaṇoddeśa-dīpikā* (32), *upanando ’bhinandaś ca pitṛvyau pūrva-jau pituḥ:* “The elder brothers of Nanda Mahārāja were Upananda and Abhinanda.” Similarly, in the same verse the names of the younger brothers of Nanda Mahārāja are given: *pitṛvyau tu kanīyāṁsau syātāṁ sannanda-nandanau.* “Sannanda and Nandana \[also known as Sunanda and Pāṇḍava\] were the younger brothers of Kṛṣṇa’s father, Nanda Mahārāja.” Śrī Kṛṣṇa’s maternal uncles are also described in this book (in verse 46): *yaśodhara-yaśodeva-sudevādyās tu mātulāḥ.* “Yaśodhara, Yaśodeva and Sudeva were the maternal uncles of Kṛṣṇa.” Also mentioned in the *Rādhā-kṛṣṇa-gaṇoddeśa-dīpikā* (38) are Kṛṣṇa’s uncles who were the husbands of Nanda Mahārāja’s sisters: *mahānīlaḥ sunīlaś ca ramaṇāv etayoḥ kramāt.* “Mahānīla and Sunīla are the husbands of Kṛṣṇa’s aunts.”

### Translation

**“You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead, whereas I am a most insignificant living being. Therefore please accept a little quantity of food from my house.”**

### Purport

A *sannyāsī* is expected to collect a little food from each and every householder. That is to say, he should take whatever he requires to eat. This system is called *mādhukarī.* The word *mādhukarī* comes from the word *madhukara* and means “honey-collecting bees.” Bees collect a little honey from each flower, but all these small quantities of honey accumulate to become a beehive. *Sannyāsīs* should collect a little from each and every householder and should eat simply what is necessary to maintain the body. Being a *sannyāsī,* Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu could collect a little food from the house of Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya, and this was the Bhaṭṭācārya’s request. Compared to the food eaten by the Lord on other occasions, the Bhaṭṭācārya’s feast was not even a morsel. This is what the Bhaṭṭācārya is pointing out to the Lord.

### Purport

The *Hari-bhakti-vilāsa* cites the following quotation from the *Skanda Purāṇa* concerning the blaspheming of a Vaiṣṇava:

*yo hi bhāgavataṁ lokam* *upahāsaṁ nṛpottama  
karoti tasya naśyanti* *artha-dharma-yaśaḥ-sutāḥ*

*nindāṁ kurvanti ye mūḍhā* *vaiṣṇavānāṁ mahātmanām  
patanti pitṛbhiḥ sārdhaṁ* *mahā-raurava-saṁjñite*

*hanti nindati vai dveṣṭi* *vaiṣṇavān nābhinandati  
krudhyate yāti no harṣaṁ* *darśane patanāni ṣaṭ*

In a conversation between Mārkaṇḍeya and Bhagīratha, it is said, “My dear King, one who derides an exalted devotee loses the results of his pious activities, his opulence, his reputation and his sons. Vaiṣṇavas are all great souls. Whoever blasphemes them falls down to the hell known as Mahāraurava, accompanied by his forefathers. Whoever kills or blasphemes a Vaiṣṇava and whoever is envious of a Vaiṣṇava or angry with him, or whoever does not offer him obeisances or feel joy upon seeing him, certainly falls into a hellish condition.”

Also, the *Hari-bhakti-vilāsa* (10.314) gives the following quotation from the *Dvārakā-māhātmya:*

*kara-patraiś ca phālyante* *su-tīvrair yama-śāsanaiḥ  
nindāṁ kurvanti ye pāpā* *vaiṣṇavānāṁ mahātmanām*

In a conversation between Prahlāda Mahārāja and Bali Mahārāja, it is said, “Those sinful people who blaspheme Vaiṣṇavas, who are all great souls, are subjected very severely to the punishment offered by Yamarāja.”

In his *Bhakti-sandarbha* (313), Jīva Gosvāmī quotes this statement concerning the blaspheming of Lord Viṣṇu:

*ye nindanti hṛṣīkeśaṁ* *tad-bhaktaṁ puṇya-rūpiṇam  
śata-janmārjitaṁ puṇyaṁ* *teṣāṁ naśyati niścitam*

*te pacyante mahā-ghore* *kumbhīpāke bhayānake  
bhakṣitāḥ kīṭa-saṅghena* *yāvac candra-divākarau*

*śrī-viṣṇor avamānanād gurutaraṁ śrī-vaiṣṇavollaṅghanam*

*tadīya-dūṣaka-janān* *na paśyet puruṣādhamān  
taiḥ sārdhaṁ vañcaka-janaiḥ* *saha-vāsaṁ na kārayet*

“ ‘One who criticizes Lord Viṣṇu and His devotees loses all the benefits accrued in a hundred pious births. Such a person rots in the Kumbhīpāka hell and is bitten by worms as long as the sun and moon exist. One should therefore not even see the face of a person who blasphemes Lord Viṣṇu and His devotees. Never try to associate with such persons.’ ”

In his *Bhakti-sandarbha* (265), Jīva Gosvāmī further quotes from *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (10.74.40):

*nindāṁ bhagavataḥ śṛṇvaṁs* *tat-parasya janasya vā  
tato nāpaiti yaḥ so ’pi* *yāty adhaḥ sukṛtāc cyutaḥ*

“ ‘If one does not immediately leave upon hearing the Lord or the Lord’s devotee blasphemed, he falls down from devotional service.’ ” Similarly, Lord Śiva’s wife Satī states in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (4.4.17):

*karṇau pidhāya nirayād yad akalpa īśe *
 *dharmāvitary asṛṇibhir nṛbhir asyamāne  
chindyāt prasahya ruśatīm asatīṁ prabhuś cej *
 *jihvām asūn api tato visṛjet sa dharmaḥ*

“If one hears an irresponsible person blaspheme the master and controller of religion, he should block his ears and go away if unable to punish him. But if one is able to kill, then one should by force cut out the blasphemer’s tongue and kill the offender, and after that he should give up his own life.”

### Purport

Śrīla Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya considered that if Amogha were killed, the killer would suffer sinful reactions for killing the body of a *brāhmaṇa.* For the same reason, it would have been undesirable for the Bhaṭṭācārya to commit suicide because he also was a *brāhmaṇa.* Since neither course could be accepted, the Bhaṭṭācārya decided to give up his relationship with Amogha and never see his face.

As far as killing the body of a *brāhmaṇa* is concerned, *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (1.7.53) gives the following injunction concerning a *brahma-bandhu,* a person born of a *brāhmaṇa* father but devoid of brahminical qualities:

*śrī-bhagavān uvāca  
brahma-bandhur na hantavya* *ātatāyī vadhār-haṇaḥ*

“The Personality of Godhead Śrī Kṛṣṇa said, ‘A *brahma-bandhu* is not to be killed, but if he is an aggressor, he must be killed.’ ”

Quoting from the *smṛti,* Śrīla Śrīdhara Svāmī comments on this quotation from *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam:*

*ātatāyinam āyāntam* *api vedānta-pāragam  
jighāṁ santaṁ jighāṁsīyān* *na tena brahma-hā bhavet*

“ ‘An aggressor intent on killing may be a very learned scholar of Vedānta, yet he should be killed because of his envy in killing others. In such a case, it is not sinful to kill a *brāhmaṇa.*’ ”

It is also stated in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (1.7.57):

*vapanaṁ draviṇādānaṁ* *sthānān niryāpaṇaṁ tathā  
eṣa hi brahma-bandhūnāṁ* *vadho nānyo ’sti daihikaḥ*

“Cutting the hair from his head, depriving him of his wealth and driving him from his residence are the prescribed punishments for a *brahma-bandhu.* There is no injunction for killing the body.”

As far as Ṣāṭhī, the daughter of Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya, was concerned, she was advised to give up her relationship with her husband. Concerning this, *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (5.5.18) states, *na patiś ca sa syān na mocayed yaḥ samupeta-mṛtyum:* “One cannot be a husband if he cannot liberate his dependents from inevitable death.” If a person is not in Kṛṣṇa consciousness and is bereft of spiritual power, he cannot protect his wife from the path of repeated birth and death. Consequently such a person cannot be accepted as a husband. A wife should dedicate her life and everything to Kṛṣṇa for further advancement in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. If her husband abandons Kṛṣṇa consciousness and she gives up her connection with him, she follows in the footsteps of the *dvija-patnīs,* the wives of the *brāhmaṇas* who were engaged in performing sacrifices. The wife is not to be condemned for cutting off such a relationship. In this regard, Śrī Kṛṣṇa assures the *dvija-patnīs* in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (10.23.31-32):

*patayo nābhyasūyeran* *pitṛ-bhrātṛ-sutādayaḥ  
lokāś ca vo mayopetā* *devā apy anumanvate*

*na prītaye ’nurāgāya* *hy aṅga-saṅgo nṛṇām iha  
tan mano mayi yuñjānā* *acirān mām avāpsyatha*

“My dear *dvija-patnīs,* rest assured that your husbands will not neglect you on your return, nor will your brothers, sons or fathers refuse to accept you. Because you are My pure devotees, not only your relatives but also people in general, as well as the demigods, will be satisfied with you. Transcendental love for Me does not depend upon bodily connection, but anyone whose mind is always absorbed in Me will surely, very soon, come to Me for My eternal association.”

The Kaurava soldiers were under the command of Karṇa, but the commander-in-chief of the Gandharvas was able to arrest all the Kauravas by virtue of superior military strength. At that time Duryodhana’s ministers and commanders requested Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira to help. After being thus petitioned, Bhīmasena spoke the verse given above, remembering Duryodhana’s former nefarious and atrocious activities against them. Indeed, Bhīmasena felt it very fitting that Duryodhana and his company were arrested. This could have been accomplished by the Pāṇḍavas only with great endeavor.

### Purport

This statement (*Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* 10.4.46) was made by Śukadeva Gosvāmī to Mahārāja Parīkṣit. This quotation concerns the attempted killing of Kṛṣṇa’s sister (Yogamāyā), who appeared before Kṛṣṇa’s birth as the daughter of mother Yaśodā. This daughter Yogamāyā and Kṛṣṇa were born simultaneously, and Vasudeva replaced Yogamāyā with Kṛṣṇa and took Yogamāyā away. When she was brought to Mathurā and Kaṁsa attempted to kill her, Yogamāyā slipped out of his hands. She could not be killed. She then informed Kaṁsa about the birth of his enemy, Kṛṣṇa, and being thus baffled, Kaṁsa consulted his associates, who were all demons. When this big conspiracy was taking place, this verse was spoken by Śukadeva Gosvāmī. He points out that a demon can lose everything because of his nefarious activities.

The word *mahad-atikrama,* meaning “envy of Lord Viṣṇu and His devotees,” is significant in this verse. The word *mahat* indicates a great personality, a devotee or the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself. Being always engaged in the Lord’s service, the devotees themselves are as great as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The word *mahat* is also explained by Lord Kṛṣṇa in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (9.13):

*mahātmānas tu māṁ pārtha* *daivīṁ prakṛtim āśritāḥ  
bhajanty ananya-manaso* *jñātvā bhūtādim avyayam*

“O son of Pṛthā, those who are not deluded, the great souls, are under the protection of the divine nature. They are fully engaged in devotional service because they know Me as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, original and inexhaustible.”

Being envious of the Lord and His devotees is not at all auspicious for a demon. By such envy, a demon loses everything considered beneficial.

### Purport

The Absolute Truth is realized in three phases — impersonal Brahman, Paramātmā and the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Bhagavān. All of these are one and the same truth, but Brahman, Paramātmā and Bhagavān constitute three different features. Whoever understands Brahman is called a *brāhmaṇa,* and when a *brāhmaṇa* engages in the Lord’s devotional service, he is called a Vaiṣṇava. Unless one comes to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, his realization of impersonal Brahman is imperfect. A *brāhmaṇa* can chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra* on the platform of *nāmābhāsa,* but not on the platform of pure vibration. When a *brāhmaṇa* engages in the Lord’s service, fully understanding his eternal relationship, his devotional service is called *abhidheya.* When one attains that stage, he is called a *bhāgavata,* or Vaiṣṇava. This indicates that he is free from contamination and material attachment. Lord Kṛṣṇa confirms this in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (7.28):

*yeṣāṁ tv anta-gataṁ pāpaṁ* *janānāṁ puṇya-karmaṇām  
te dvandva-moha-nirmuktā* *bhajante māṁ dṛḍha-vratāḥ*

“Persons who have acted piously in previous lives and in this life and whose sinful actions are completely eradicated are freed from the duality of delusion, and they engage themselves in My service with determination.”

A *brāhmaṇa* may be a very learned scholar, but this does not mean that he is free from material contamination. A *brāhmaṇa’s* contamination, however, is in the mode of goodness. In the material world, the three modes are goodness, passion and ignorance, and all of these are simply different gradations of contamination. Unless a *brāhmaṇa* transcends such contamination and approaches the platform of unalloyed devotional service, he cannot be accepted as a Vaiṣṇava. An impersonalist may be aware of the impersonal Brahman feature of the Absolute Truth, but his activities are on the impersonal platform. Sometimes he imagines a form of the Lord (*saguṇa-upāsanā*), but such an attempt is never successful in helping one attain complete realization. The impersonalist may consider himself a *brāhmaṇa* and may be situated in the mode of goodness, but nonetheless he is conditioned by one of the modes of material nature. This means that he is not yet liberated, for liberation cannot be attained unless one is completely free from the modes. In any case, the Māyāvāda philosophy keeps one conditioned. If one becomes a Vaiṣṇava through proper initiation, he automatically becomes a *brāhmaṇa.* There is no doubt about it. The *Garuḍa Purāṇa* confirms this:

*brāhmaṇānāṁ sahasrebhyaḥ* *satra-yājī viśiṣyate  
satra-yāji-sahasrebhyaḥ* *sarva-vedānta-pāragaḥ  
sarva-vedānta-vit-koṭyā* *viṣṇu-bhakto viśiṣyate*

“Out of many thousands of *brāhmaṇas,* one may become qualified to perform *yajña.* Out of many thousands of such qualified *brāhmaṇas,* one may be fully aware of the Vedānta philosophy. Out of many millions of learned Vedānta scholars, there may be one *viṣṇu-bhakta,* or devotee of Lord Viṣṇu. It is he who is most exalted.”

Unless one is a fully qualified *brāhmaṇa,* he cannot advance in the spiritual science. A real *brāhmaṇa* is never envious of Vaiṣṇavas. If he is, he is considered an imperfect neophyte. Impersonalist *brāhmaṇas* are always opposed to Vaiṣṇava principles. They are envious of Vaiṣṇavas because they do not know the goal of life. *Na te viduḥ svārtha-gatiṁ hi viṣṇum.* However, when a *brāhmaṇa* becomes a Vaiṣṇava, there is no duality. If a *brāhmaṇa* does not become a Vaiṣṇava, he certainly falls down from the *brāhmaṇa* platform. This is confirmed by *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (11.5.3): *na bhajanty avajānanti sthānād bhraṣṭāḥ patanty adhaḥ.*

We can actually see that in this Age of Kali many so-called *brāhmaṇas* are envious of Vaiṣṇavas. The Kali-contaminated *brāhmaṇas* consider Deity worship to be imaginative: *arcye viṣṇau śilā-dhīr guruṣu nara-matir vaiṣṇave jāti-buddhiḥ.* Such a contaminated *brāhmaṇa* may superficially imagine a form of the Lord, but actually he considers the Deity in the temple to be made of stone or wood. Similarly, such a contaminated *brāhmaṇa* considers the *guru* to be an ordinary human being, and he objects when a Vaiṣṇava is created by the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. Many so-called *brāhmaṇas* attempt to fight us, saying, “How can you create a *brāhmaṇa* out of a European or American? A *brāhmaṇa* can be born only in a *brāhmaṇa* family.” They do not consider that this is never stated in any revealed scripture. Lord Kṛṣṇa specifically states in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (4.13), *cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭaṁ guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ:* “According to the three modes of material nature and the work associated with them, the four divisions of human society are created by Me.”

Thus a *brāhmaṇa* is not a result of the caste system. He becomes a *brāhmaṇa* only by qualification. Similarly, a Vaiṣṇava does not belong to a particular caste; rather, his designation is determined by the rendering of devotional service.

### Purport

Amogha was an offender because he blasphemed the Lord. As a result, he was about to die of cholera. Amogha did not receive an opportunity to be freed from all offenses after being attacked by the disease, but Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya and his wife were very dear to the Lord. Because of their relationship, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu excused Amogha. Instead of being punished by the Lord, he was saved by the Lord’s mercy. All this was due to the unflinching love of Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya for Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Externally, Amogha was Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya’s son-in-law, and he was being maintained by Sārvabhauma. Consequently if Amogha were not excused, his punishment would have directly affected Sārvabhauma. Amogha’s death would have indirectly brought about the death of Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya.
