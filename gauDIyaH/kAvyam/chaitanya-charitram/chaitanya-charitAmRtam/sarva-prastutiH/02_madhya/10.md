CHAPTER TEN

While Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was traveling in South India, Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya had many talks with King Pratāparudra. When Mahārāja Pratāparudra requested the Bhaṭṭācārya to arrange an interview with the Lord, the Bhaṭṭācārya assured him that he would try to do so as soon as Caitanya Mahāprabhu returned from South India. When the Lord returned to Jagannātha Purī from His South Indian tour, He lived at the home of Kāśī Miśra. Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya introduced many Vaiṣṇavas to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu after His return. The father of Rāmānanda Rāya, Bhavānanda Rāya, offered another son named Vāṇīnātha Paṭṭanāyaka for the Lord’s service. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu informed His associates about the pollution of Kṛṣṇadāsa brought about by his association with the Bhaṭṭathāris, and thus the Lord proposed to give him leave. Nityānanda Prabhu sent Kṛṣṇadāsa to Bengal to inform the Navadvīpa devotees about the Lord’s return to Jagannātha Purī. All the devotees of Navadvīpa thus began arranging to come to Jagannātha Purī. At this time Paramānanda Purī was at Navadvīpa, and immediately upon hearing news of the Lord’s return, he started for Jagannātha Purī accompanied by a *brāhmaṇa* named Kamalākānta. Puruṣottama Bhaṭṭācārya, a resident of Navadvīpa, was educated at Vārāṇasī. He accepted the renounced order from Caitanyānanda, but he took the name of Svarūpa. Thus he arrived at the lotus feet of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. After the demise of Śrī Īśvara Purī, his disciple Govinda, following his instructions, went to serve Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Due to his relationship with Keśava Bhāratī, Brahmānanda Bhāratī was also respectfully received by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. When he arrived at Jagannātha Purī, he was advised to give up the deerskin clothing he wore. When Brahmānanda understood Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu correctly, he accepted Him as Kṛṣṇa Himself. However, when Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya addressed Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu as Kṛṣṇa, the Lord immediately protested. In the meantime, Kāśīśvara Gosvāmī also came to see Caitanya Mahāprabhu. In this chapter, devotees from many different areas come to see Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and they are exactly like many rivers that come from many places to finally flow into the sea.

### Bengali

वैष्णवेर एइ हय़ एक स्वभाव निश्चल ।  
तेँहो जीव नहेन, हन स्वतन्त्र ईश्वर ॥ १३ ॥

### Verse text

*vaiṣṇavera ei haya eka svabhāva niścala  
teṅho jīva nahena, hana svatantra īśvara*

### Translation

**“A Vaiṣṇava travels to places of pilgrimage to purify them and reclaim fallen conditioned souls. This is one of the duties of a Vaiṣṇava. Actually, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is not a living entity but the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself. Consequently, He is a fully independent controller, yet in His position as a devotee, He carries out the activities of a devotee.”**

### Purport

Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura points out that because there are many permanent residents in holy places who do not precisely follow the rules and regulations governing living in a sacred place, exalted devotees have to go to these places to reclaim such persons. This is the business of a Vaiṣṇava. A Vaiṣṇava is unhappy to see others materially enmeshed. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu taught these activities of a Vaiṣṇava although He is the worshipable Deity of all Vaiṣṇavas, the complete and independent Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is *pūrṇaḥ śuddho nitya-muktaḥ* — complete, completely uncontaminated and eternally liberated. He is *sanātana,* for He has no beginning or end.

### Translation

**The King said, “Bhaṭṭācārya, you are the most learned and experienced person I know. Therefore when you address Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu as Lord Kṛṣṇa, I accept this as the truth.**

### Purport

This is the way to advance in spiritual science. One must accept the words of an *ācārya,* a bona fide spiritual master, to clear the path for spiritual advancement. This is the secret of success. However, one’s guide must be a spiritual master who is actually an unalloyed devotee strictly following the instructions of the previous *ācārya* without deviation. Whatever the spiritual master says must be accepted by the disciple. Only then is success certain. This is the Vedic system.

Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya was a *brāhmaṇa* and a realized soul, whereas Pratāparudra was a *kṣatriya. Kṣatriya* kings used to obey very faithfully the orders of learned *brāhmaṇas* and saintly persons, and in this way they would rule their country. Similarly, *vaiśyas* used to follow the king’s orders, and *śūdras* used to serve the three higher castes. In this way the *brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas, vaiśyas* and *śūdras* used to live cooperatively, performing their respective duties. Consequently society was peaceful, and people were able to discharge the duties of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Thus they were happy in this life and able to return home, back to Godhead.

### Translation

### Purport

In this verse the word *prabhupāda,* referring to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, is significant. Regarding this, Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Gosvāmī Prabhupāda comments, “Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, and all His servants address Him as Prabhupāda. This means that there are many *prabhus* taking shelter under His lotus feet.” The pure Vaiṣṇava is addressed as *prabhu,* and this address is an etiquette observed between Vaiṣṇavas. When many *prabhus* remain under the shelter of the lotus feet of another *prabhu,* the address Prabhupāda is given. Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu and Śrī Advaita Prabhu are also addressed as Prabhupāda. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Śrī Advaita Prabhu and Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu are all *viṣṇu-tattva,* the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Viṣṇu. Therefore all living entities are under Their lotus feet. Lord Viṣṇu is the eternal Lord of everyone, and the representative of Lord Viṣṇu is the Lord’s confidential servant. Such a person acts as the spiritual master for neophyte Vaiṣṇavas; therefore the spiritual master is as respectable as Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya or Lord Viṣṇu Himself. For this reason the spiritual master is addressed as Oṁ Viṣṇupāda or Prabhupāda. The *ācārya,* the spiritual master, is generally respected by others as Śrīpāda, and the initiated Vaiṣṇavas are addressed as Prabhu. Prabhu, Prabhupāda and Viṣṇupāda are described in revealed scriptures like *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, Caitanya-caritāmṛta* and *Caitanya-bhāgavata.* In this regard, these scriptures present evidence accepted by unalloyed devotees.

The *prākṛta-sahajiyās* are not even worthy of being called Vaiṣṇavas. They think that only caste *gosvāmīs* should be called Prabhupāda. Such ignorant *sahajiyās* call themselves *vaiṣṇava-dāsa-anudāsa,* which means the servant of the servant of the Vaiṣṇavas. However, they are opposed to addressing a pure Vaiṣṇava as Prabhupāda. In other words, they are envious of a bona fide spiritual master who is addressed as Prabhupāda, and they commit offenses by considering a bona fide spiritual master an ordinary human being or a member of a certain caste. Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura describes such *sahajiyās* as most unfortunate. Because of their misconceptions, they fall into a hellish condition.

*rāya* *kahe* — Bhavānanda Rāya replied; *āmi* *śūdra* — I belong to the fourth class of the social divisions; *viṣayī* — engaged in mundane affairs; *adhama* — very fallen; *tabu* — still; *tumi* — You; *sparśa* — touch; *ei* — this; *īśvara*-*lakṣaṇa* — sign of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

### Translation

**After hearing Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s praise, Bhavānanda Rāya submitted, “I am in the fourth class of the social order, and I engage in mundane affairs. Although I am very fallen, You have still touched me. This is proof that You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead.”**

### Purport

As stated in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (5.18):

*vidyā-vinaya-sampanne* *brāhmaṇe gavi hastini  
śuni caiva śva-pāke ca* *paṇḍitāḥ sama-darśinaḥ*

“The humble sages, by virtue of true knowledge, see with equal vision a learned and gentle *brāhmaṇa,* a cow, an elephant, a dog and a dog-eater \[outcaste\].”

Those who are highly advanced in spiritual understanding do not care about a person’s material condition. A spiritually advanced person sees the spiritual identity of every living being, and consequently he makes no distinction between a learned *brāhmaṇa,* a dog, a *caṇḍāla* or anyone else. He is not influenced by the material body but sees a person’s spiritual identity. Consequently Bhavānanda Rāya appreciated Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s statement, which showed that the Lord did not consider the social position of Bhavānanda Rāya, who belonged to the *śūdra* caste engaged in mundane activities. Rather, the Lord considered the spiritual position of Bhavānanda Rāya, along with that of Rāmānanda Rāya and his brothers. The servant of the Lord is also similarly inclined. He gives shelter to any person — any living entity — regardless of whether he belongs to a *brāhmaṇa* family or a *caṇḍāla* family*.* The spiritual master reclaims all people and encourages everyone in spiritual life. By taking shelter of such a devotee, one can make his life successful. As confirmed in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (2.4.18):

*kirāta-hūṇāndhra-pulinda-pulkaśā *
 *ābhīra-śumbhā yavanāḥ khasādayaḥ  
ye ’nye ca pāpā yad-apāśrayāśrayāḥ *
 *śudhyanti tasmai prabhaviṣṇave namaḥ*

“Kirātas, Hūṇas, Āndhras, Pulindas, Pulkaśas, Ābhīras, Śumbhas, Yavanas and members of the Khaśa races, and even others who are addicted to sinful acts, can be purified by taking shelter of the devotees of the Lord, due to His being the supreme power. I beg to offer my respectful obeisances unto Him.”

Whoever takes shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead or His pure devotee is elevated to the spiritual order and purified from material contamination. This is also confirmed by Kṛṣṇa in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (9.32):

*māṁ hi pārtha vyapāśritya* *ye ’pi syuḥ pāpa-yonayaḥ  
striyo vaiśyās tathā śūdrās* *te ’pi yānti parāṁ gatim*

“O son of Pṛthā, those who take shelter in Me, though they be of lower birth — women, *vaiśyas* \[merchants\] and *śūdras* \[workers\] — can attain the supreme destination.”

### Synonyms

*nija* — own; *gṛha* — house; *vitta* — wealth; *bhṛtya* — servants; *pañca*-*putra* — five sons; *sane* — with; *ātmā* — self; *samarpiluṅ* — surrender; *āmi* — I; *tomāra* — Your; *caraṇe* — at the lotus feet.

### Translation

**Appreciating Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s favor, Bhavānanda Rāya also said, “Along with my home, riches, servants and five sons, I surrender myself at Your lotus feet.**

### Purport

This is the process of surrender. As Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura sings:

*mānasa, deha, geha, yo kichu mora  
arpiluṅ tuyā pade nanda-kiśora!*

(*Śaraṇāgati*)

When one surrenders unto the lotus feet of the Lord, he does so with everything in his possession — his house, his body, his mind and whatever else he possesses. If there is any obstruction to this surrendering process, one should immediately give it up without attachment. If one can surrender with all his family members, there is no need to take *sannyāsa.* However, if the surrendering process is hampered by so-called family members, one should immediately give them up to complete the surrendering process.

### Translation

**“Now that I have brought him here, I am asking him to leave. Now he can go wherever he likes, for I am no longer responsible for him.”**

### Purport

Kālā Kṛṣṇadāsa was influenced and allured by nomads or gypsies, who enticed him with women. *Māyā* is so strong that Kālā Kṛṣṇadāsa left Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s company to join gypsy women. Even though a person may associate with Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, he can be allured by *māyā* and leave the Lord’s company due to his slight independence. Only one who is overwhelmed by *māyā* can be so unfortunate as to leave Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s company, yet unless one is very conscientious, the influence of *māyā* can drag one away, even though he be the personal assistant of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. And what to speak of others? The Bhaṭṭathāris used to increase their numbers by using women to allure outsiders. This is factual evidence showing that it is possible at any time to fall down from the Lord’s association. One need only misuse his little independence. Once fallen and separated from the Supreme Personality of Godhead’s association, one becomes a candidate for suffering in the material world. Although rejected by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Kālā Kṛṣṇadāsa was given another chance, as the following verses relate.

Even though a person is rejected by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the devotees of the Lord do not reject him; therefore the Lord’s devotees are more merciful than the Lord Himself. Śrīla Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura thus sings, *chāḍiyā vaiṣṇava-sevā nistāra peyeche kebā:* one cannot be relieved from the material clutches without engaging in the service of pure devotees. The Lord Himself may sometimes be very hard, but the devotees are always kind. Thus Kālā Kṛṣṇadāsa received the mercy of the four devotees mentioned above.

“Svarūpa” is one of the names of a *brahmacārī* in Śaṅkarācārya’s disciplic succession.

Dāmodara Svarūpa was formerly a resident of Navadvīpa, and his name was Puruṣottama Ācārya. When he went to Vārāṇasī, he took *sannyāsa* from a *sannyāsī* designated Tīrtha. Although he received the title Svarūpa in his *brahmacārī* stage, he did not change his name when he took *sannyāsa.* Actually as a *sannyāsī* he should have been called Tīrtha, but he chose to retain his original *brahmacārī* title of Svarūpa.

### Verse text

*sannyāsa karilā śikhā-sūtra-tyāga-rūpa  
yoga-paṭṭa nā nila, nāma haila ‘svarūpa’*

### Synonyms

*sannyāsa* *karilā* — accepted the *sannyāsa* order; *śikhā* — tuft of hair; *sūtra* — sacred thread; *tyāga* — giving up; *rūpa* — in the form of; *yoga*-*paṭṭa* — saffron-colored dress; *nā* *nila* — did not accept; *nāma* — name; *haila* — was; *svarūpa* — Svarūpa.

### Translation

**Upon accepting sannyāsa, Puruṣottama Ācārya followed the regulative principles by giving up his tuft of hair and sacred thread, but he did not accept the saffron-colored dress. Also, he did not accept a sannyāsī title but remained as a naiṣṭhika-brahmacārī.**

### Purport

There are regulative principles governing the renounced order. One has to perform eight kinds of *śrāddha.* One must offer oblations to one’s forefathers and perform the sacrifice of *virajā-homa.* Then one must cut off the tuft of hair called a *śikhā* and also give up the sacred thread. These are preliminary processes in the acceptance of *sannyāsa,* and Svarūpa Dāmodara accepted all these. However, Puruṣottama Ācārya did not accept the saffron color, a *sannyāsī* name or a *daṇḍa,* and for this reason he retained his *brahmacārī* name. Actually Puruṣottama Ācārya did not accept the *sannyāsa* order formally, but he renounced worldly life. He did not want to be disturbed by the formality of the *sannyāsa* order. He simply wanted to worship Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa without disturbance; therefore with heart and soul he took up the renounced order but not the formalities accompanying it. Renunciation means not doing anything but serving the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Śrī Kṛṣṇa. When one acts on this platform, trying to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one is both a *sannyāsī* and a *yogī.* This is confirmed in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (6.1):

*śrī-bhagavān uvāca  
anāśritaḥ karma-phalaṁ* *kāryaṁ karma karoti yaḥ  
sa sannyāsī ca yogī ca* *na niragnir na cākriyaḥ*

“The Supreme Personality of Godhead said, ‘One who is unattached to the fruits of his work and who works as he is obligated is in the renounced order of life, and he is the true mystic, not he who lights no fire and performs no work.’ ”

śunite nā haya prabhura cittera ullāsa*

### Synonyms

*bhakti*-*siddhānta* — conclusive statements about the science of devotional service; *viruddha* — opposing; *āra* — and; *rasa*-*ābhāsa* — overlapping of transcendental mellows; *śunite* — to hear; *nā* — not; *haya* — becomes; *prabhura* — of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu; *cittera* — of the heart; *ullāsa* — jubilation.

### Translation

**Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was never pleased to hear books or verses opposed to the conclusive statements of devotional service. The Lord did not like hearing rasābhāsa, the overlapping of transcendental mellows.**

### Purport

*Bhakti-siddhānta-viruddha* refers to that which is against the principle of unity in diversity, philosophically known as *acintya-bhedābheda* — simultaneous oneness and difference — whereas *rasābhāsa* is something that may appear to be a transcendental mellow but actually is not. Those who are pure Vaiṣṇavas should avoid both these things opposed to devotional service. These misconceptions practically parallel the Māyāvāda philosophy. If one indulges in Māyāvāda philosophy, he gradually falls down from the platform of devotional service. By overlapping mellows (*rasābhāsa*) one eventually becomes a *prākṛta-sahajiyā* and takes everything to be very easy. One may also become a member of the *bāula* community and gradually become attracted to material activities. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu has therefore advised us to avoid *bhakti-siddhānta-viruddha* and *rasābhāsa.* In this way the devotee can remain pure and free from falldowns. Everyone should try to remain aloof from *bhakti-siddhānta-viruddha* and *rasābhāsa.*

### Translation

**It was the practice of Svarūpa Dāmodara Gosvāmī to examine all literatures to find out whether their conclusions were correct. Only then would he allow them to be heard by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.**

### Purport

Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura says that if something impedes the execution of devotional service, it should be understood to be impure. Pure devotees of the Lord do not accept impure principles. Impure devotees accept *rasābhāsa,* or overlapping, contradictory mellows, and other principles opposed to the *bhakti* path. The followers of such impure principles are never accepted as pure devotees. There are many parties following the path of *rasābhāsa,* and the followers are sometimes adored by ordinary men. Those who adopt the conclusions of *rasābhāsa* and *bhakti-siddhānta-viruddha* are never accepted as devotees of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Svarūpa Dāmodara Gosvāmī never approved such followers as Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇavas, nor did he allow them even to meet the Supreme Lord, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

### Purport

Svarūpa Dāmodara Gosvāmī was very expert in music as well as the Vedic scriptures. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu used to call him Dāmodara because of his expert singing and musical skills. The name Dāmodara was given by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and added to the name given by his *sannyāsa-guru.* He was therefore known as Svarūpa Dāmodara, or Dāmodara Svarūpa. He compiled a book of music named *Saṅgīta-dāmodara.*

### Translation

**“O ocean of mercy, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu! Let there be an awakening of Your auspicious mercy, which easily drives away all kinds of material lamentation by making everything pure and blissful. Indeed, Your mercy awakens transcendental bliss and covers all material pleasures. By Your auspicious mercy, quarrels and disagreements arising among different scriptures are vanquished. Your auspicious mercy pours forth transcendental mellows and thus causes the heart to jubilate. Your mercy, which is full of joy, always stimulates devotional service and glorifies conjugal love of God. May transcendental bliss be awakened within my heart by Your causeless mercy.”**

### Purport

This important verse (*Śrī Caitanya-candrodaya-nāṭaka* 8.10) specifically describes the Lord’s causeless mercy. Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura explains that Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, who is the most magnanimous Personality of Godhead, distributes His causeless mercy in three ways to the conditioned soul. Every living entity is morose in the material world because he is always in want. He undergoes a great struggle for existence and tries to minimize his miserable condition by squeezing the utmost pleasure out of this world. But the living entity is never successful in this endeavor. While in a miserable condition, a person sometimes seeks the favor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but this is very difficult for materialistic people to obtain. However, when one becomes Kṛṣṇa conscious by the grace of the Lord, the fragrance of the lotus feet of the Lord expands, and in this way a materialist may gain freedom from his miseries. Actually his mind is cleansed by his transcendental connection with the lotus feet of the Lord. At such a time one is enlightened by the loving service of the Lord.

There are many different kinds of scriptures, and by reading them one often becomes puzzled. But when one receives the mercy of the Lord, his confusion is mitigated. Not only are scriptural disparities resolved, but a kind of transcendental bliss is awakened, and in this way one is fully satisfied. The transcendental loving service of the Lord constantly engages the conditioned soul in serving the Lord’s lotus feet. Through such fortunate engagement, one’s transcendental love for Kṛṣṇa is increased. One’s position is thus completely purified, and one is filled with transcendental bliss accompanied by the spirit soul’s jubilation.

Thus the transcendental causeless mercy of Lord Kṛṣṇa is manifested in the heart of the devotee. At such a time, material needs no longer exist. The lamentation that invariably accompanies material desires also vanishes. By the grace of the Lord one is elevated to the transcendental position, and then the transcendental mellows of the spiritual world are manifested in him. One’s devotional service then becomes firm, and one engages in the Lord’s transcendental loving service with great determination. All these combine to fully awaken the devotee’s heart with love of Kṛṣṇa.

In the beginning, a conditioned soul is bereft of Kṛṣṇa consciousness and is always morose in his material activities. Later, by associating with a pure devotee, one becomes inquisitive to know the Absolute Truth. In this way one begins to engage in the transcendental service of the Lord. Next, by the Lord’s grace all misconceptions are vanquished and the heart is cleansed of all material dirt. It is only then that the pleasure of transcendental bliss is awakened. By the Lord’s mercy one is completely convinced of the value of devotional service. When one can see the pastimes of the Lord everywhere, he is firmly situated in transcendental bliss. Such a devotee is relieved of all kinds of material desires, and he preaches the glories of the Lord all over the world. These Kṛṣṇa conscious activities separate him from material activities and the desire for liberation, because at every step the devotee feels himself connected with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Although such a devotee may sometimes be involved in household life, he is untouched by material existence due to his constant engagement in devotional service. Thus everyone is advised to take shelter of devotional service to become happy and liberated.

*eta* *śuni’* — hearing this; *sārvabhauma* — Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya; *prabhure* — unto the Lord; *puchila* — inquired; *purī*-*gosāñi* — Īśvara Purī; *śūdra*-*sevaka* — a servant who is a *śūdra*; *kāṅhe* *ta’* — why; *rākhila* — kept.

### Translation

**After hearing this, Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya asked Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, “Why did Īśvara Purī keep a servant who comes from a śūdra family?”**

### Purport

Both Kāśīśvara and Govinda were personal servants of Īśvara Purī. After Īśvara Purī’s demise, Kāśīśvara went to visit all the holy places of India. Following the orders of his spiritual master, Govinda immediately went to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu for shelter. Govinda came from a *śūdra* family, but because he was initiated by Īśvara Purī, he was certainly a *brāhmaṇa.* Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya here asked Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu why Īśvara Purī accepted a disciple from a *śūdra* family. According to the *smṛti-śāstra,* which gives directions for the management of the *varṇāśrama* institution, a *brāhmaṇa* cannot accept a disciple from the lower castes. In other words, a *kṣatriya, vaiśya* or *śūdra* cannot be accepted as a servant. If a spiritual master accepts such a person, he is contaminated. Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya therefore asked why Īśvara Purī accepted a servant or disciple born of a *śūdra* family.

In answer to this question, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu replied that His spiritual master, Īśvara Purī, was so empowered that he was as good as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As such, Īśvara Purī was the spiritual master of the whole world. He was not a servant of any mundane rule or regulation. An empowered spiritual master like Īśvara Purī can bestow his mercy upon anyone, irrespective of caste or creed. The conclusion is that an empowered spiritual master is authorized by Kṛṣṇa and his own *guru* and should therefore be considered as good as the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself. That is the verdict of Viśvanātha Cakravartī: *sākṣād-dharitvena.* An authorized spiritual master is as good as Hari, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As Hari is free to act as He likes, the empowered spiritual master is also free. As Hari is not subject to mundane rules and regulations, the spiritual master empowered by Him is also not subject. According to the *Caitanya-caritāmṛta* (*Antya-līlā* 7.11), *kṛṣṇa-śakti vinā nahe tāra pravartana.* An authorized spiritual master empowered by Kṛṣṇa can spread the glories of the holy name of the Lord, for he has power of attorney from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the mundane world, anyone possessing his master’s power of attorney can act on behalf of his master. Similarly, a spiritual master empowered by Kṛṣṇa through his own bona fide spiritual master should be considered as good as the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself. That is the meaning of *sākṣād-dharitvena.* Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu therefore describes the activities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the bona fide spiritual master as follows.

### Translation

**Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, “Both the Supreme Personality of Godhead and My spiritual master, Īśvara Purī, are completely independent. Therefore neither the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead nor that of Īśvara Purī is subject to any Vedic rules and regulations.**

### Translation

**“Lord Kṛṣṇa’s mercy is dependent only on affection. Being obliged only by affection, Lord Kṛṣṇa acts very independently.**

### Purport

Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is merciful, but His mercy does not depend on mundane rules and regulations. He is dependent only on affection and nothing else. Service to Lord Kṛṣṇa can be rendered in two ways. One can serve the Lord in affection or in veneration. When service is rendered in affection, it is the Lord’s special mercy. When service is rendered in veneration, it is doubtful whether Kṛṣṇa’s mercy is actually involved. If Kṛṣṇa’s mercy is there, it is not dependent on any prescribed caste or creed. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu wanted to inform Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya that Lord Kṛṣṇa is the spiritual master of everyone, and He does not care for mundane caste or creed. Therefore Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu cited the example of Lord Kṛṣṇa’s accepting food at the house of Vidura, who was a *śūdra* by birth. By the same token, Īśvara Purī, an empowered spiritual master, could show mercy to anyone. As such, he accepted Govinda, although the boy was born in a *śūdra* family. When Govinda was initiated, he became a *brāhmaṇa* and was accepted as Īśvara Purī’s personal servant. In the *Hari-bhakti-vilāsa,* Śrī Sanātana Gosvāmī states that one who is initiated by a bona fide spiritual master immediately becomes a *brāhmaṇa.* A pseudo spiritual master cannot transform a person into a *brāhmaṇa,* but an authorized spiritual master can do so. This is the verdict of *śāstra,* Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and all the Gosvāmīs.

A *guru’s* servants or disciples are all Godbrothers to one another, and as such they should all respect one another as *prabhu,* or master. No one should disrespect his Godbrother. For this reason Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu asked Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya what to do about Govinda. Govinda was the personal servant of Īśvara Purī, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s spiritual master, and now Īśvara Purī had ordered Govinda to become Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s personal servant. So what was to be done? This was the inquiry Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu placed before Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya, an experienced friend.

On the other hand, Brahmānanda Bhāratī also wanted to prove that Jagannātha and Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu are one, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but that to fulfill His mission Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu appeared to be moving whereas Lord Jagannātha appeared to be inert. Thus this jolly argument was going on. Finally, Brahmānanda Bhāratī referred the whole matter to Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya for a final decision.

**Brahmānanda Bhāratī continued, “The living entity is localized, whereas the Supreme Brahman is all-pervading. That is the verdict of the revealed scriptures.**

### Purport

Brahmānanda Bhāratī drew Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya’s attention because he wanted him to judge the argument. He then stated that Brahman, the Supreme Lord, is all-pervading. This is confirmed by Lord Kṛṣṇa in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (13.3):

*kṣetra-jñaṁ cāpi māṁ viddhi* *sarva-kṣetreṣu bhārata  
kṣetra-kṣetrajñayor jñānaṁ* *yat taj jñānaṁ mataṁ mama*

“O scion of Bharata, you should understand that I am also the knower in all bodies, and to understand this body and its knower is called knowledge. That is My opinion.”

The Supreme Personality of Godhead in His Paramātmā feature is expanded everywhere. The *Brahma-saṁhitā* says, *aṇḍāntara-stha-paramāṇu-cayāntara-stham:* by virtue of His all-pervasive nature, the Supreme Lord is within the universe as well as within all elements of the universe. He is even within the atom. In this way the Supreme Lord Govinda is all-pervasive. On the other hand, the living entities are very, very small. It is said that the living entity is one ten-thousandth of the tip of a hair. Therefore the living entity is localized. Living entities rest on the Brahman effulgence, the bodily rays of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

This is confirmed in the *Vedas: nityo nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānām.* The Supreme Personality of Godhead is Brahman or Parambrahman, the chief of all living entities. Both the Supreme Brahman, or the Personality of Godhead, and the living entities are persons, but the Supreme Brahman is the predominator, whereas the living entities are predominated.

### Translation

**“I have been meditating on the impersonal Brahman since my birth, but since I have seen You, I have fully experienced Kṛṣṇa.”**

### Purport

Brahmānanda Bhāratī admitted that when there is an argument between the spiritual master and the disciple, the spiritual master is naturally victorious, although the disciple may put forward a strong argument. In other words, it is customary that the words of the spiritual master are more worshipable than the words of a disciple. Under the circumstances, since Brahmānanda Bhāratī was in the position of a spiritual master, he emerged victorious over Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, who considered Himself Brahmānanda Bhāratī’s disciple. However, Brahmānanda Bhāratī reversed the argument and took the position of a devotee, stating that Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa. This means that the Lord was voluntarily defeated out of affection for His devotee. He was defeated voluntarily, because no one can defeat the Supreme Lord. Concerning this, the words of Bhīṣma in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (1.9.37) are important:

*sva-nigamam apahāya mat-pratijñām *
 *ṛtam adhikartum avapluto ratha-sthaḥ  
dhṛta-ratha-caraṇo ’bhyayāc calad-gur *
 *harir iva hantum ibhaṁ gatottarīyaḥ*

“Fulfilling my desire and sacrificing His own promise, He got down from the chariot, took up its wheel and ran toward me hurriedly, just as a lion goes to kill an elephant. He even dropped His outer garment on the way.”

Kṛṣṇa promised not to fight in the Battle of Kurukṣetra, but Bhīṣma, in order to break Kṛṣṇa’s promise, attacked Arjuna in such a vigorous way that Kṛṣṇa was obliged to take up a chariot wheel and attack Bhīṣma. The Lord did this to show that His devotee was being maintained at the sacrifice of His own promise. Brahmānanda Bhāratī said, “Since the beginning of my life I was attached to impersonal Brahman realization, but as soon as I saw You, I became very much attached to the Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa.” Therefore Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is Lord Kṛṣṇa Himself, and thus Brahmānanda Bhāratī became His devotee.

### Translation

**“Bilvamaṅgala Ṭhākura abandoned his impersonal realization for the realization of the Personality of Godhead. I now see that my condition is similar to his, for it has already changed.”**

### Purport

In his early life, Bilvamaṅgala Ṭhākura was an impersonalistic monist, and he used to meditate upon the impersonal Brahman effulgence. Later he became a devotee of Lord Kṛṣṇa, and his explanation for this change is given in a verse (text 178) that is quoted in the *Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu.* Sometimes a devotee gradually comes to the stage of Bhagavān realization, realization of the Supreme Person, after having attained the lower stages of realization — impersonal Brahman realization and localized Paramātmā realization. The condition of such a devotee is described in the *Caitanya-candrāmṛta* (5), by Prabodhānanda Sarasvatī:

*kaivalyaṁ narakāyate tridaśa-pūr ākāśa-puṣpāyate *
 *durdāntendriya-kāla-sarpa-paṭalī protkhāta-daṁṣṭrāyate  
viśvaṁ pūrṇa-sukhāyate vidhi-mahendrādiś ca kīṭāyate *
 *yat-kāruṇya-kaṭākṣa-vaibhava-vatāṁ taṁ gauram eva stumaḥ*

*Kaivalya,* oneness in the effulgence of Brahman, appears hellish to the devotee. The heavenly planets, the abodes of the demigods, appear to a devotee like phantasmagorias. The *yogīs* meditate for sense control, but for the devotee the senses appear like serpents with broken teeth. The devotee doesn’t have to control his senses, for his senses are already engaged in the Lord’s service. Consequently there is no possibility that the senses will act like serpents. In the material condition, the senses are as strong as poisonous snakes. But when the senses are engaged in the Lord’s service, they are like poisonous snakes with their fangs removed, and so they are no longer dangerous. The entire world is a replica of Vaikuṇṭha for the devotee because he has no anxiety. He sees that everything belongs to Kṛṣṇa, and he does not want to enjoy anything for himself. He does not even aspire for the position of Lord Brahmā or Indra. He simply wants to engage everything in the service of the Lord; therefore he has no problem. He stands in his original constitutional position. All this is possible when one receives Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s merciful glance.

In the *Caitanya-candrāmṛta* there are many more verses illustrating this same principle.

*dhik kurvanti ca brahma-yoga-viduṣas taṁ gauracandraṁ numaḥ*

(*Caitanya-candrāmṛta* 6)

*tāvad brahma-kathā vimukta-padavī tāvan na tiktī-bhavet *
 *tāvac cāpi viśṛṅkhalatvam ayate no loka-veda-sthitiḥ  
tāvac chāstra-vidāṁ mithaḥ kala-kalo nānā-bahir-vartmasu *
 *śrī-caitanya-padāmbuja-priya-jano yāvan na dig-gocaraḥ*

(*Caitanya-candrāmṛta* 19)

*gauraś cauraḥ sakalam aharat ko ’pi me tīvra-vīryaḥ*

(*Caitanya-candrāmṛta* 60)

A discussion of the impersonal Brahman is not very palatable to a devotee. The so-called regulations of the *śāstras* also appear null and void to him. There are many people who argue over the *śāstras,* but for a devotee such discussions are but tumultuous roaring. By the influence of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, all these problems disappear.

### Translation

**“Without having ecstatic love for Kṛṣṇa, one cannot see Him directly. Therefore through the mercy of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Brahmānanda Bhāratī has acquired direct vision of the Lord.”**

### Purport

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, “You are Brahmānanda Bhāratī, an advanced devotee who ecstatically loves the Supreme Lord. Therefore you see Kṛṣṇa everywhere, and there is no doubt about it.” Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya was a mediator between Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and Brahmānanda Bhāratī, and his judgment was that an advanced devotee like Brahmānanda Bhāratī was seeing Kṛṣṇa by Kṛṣṇa’s mercy. Kṛṣṇa directly presents Himself before the vision of an advanced devotee. Since Brahmānanda Bhāratī was an advanced devotee, he saw Kṛṣṇa in the person of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. In the words of the *Brahma-saṁhitā* (5.38):

*premāñjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena *
 *santaḥ sadaiva hṛdayeṣu vilokayanti  
yaṁ śyāmasundaram acintya-guṇa-svarūpaṁ *
 *govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi*

“I worship the primeval Lord, Govinda, who is always seen by the devotee whose eyes are anointed with the pulp of love. He is seen in His eternal form of Śyāmasundara, situated within the heart of the devotee.”

### Translation

**Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, “Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya, what are you saying? Lord Viṣṇu, save Me! Such glorification is simply another form of blasphemy.”**

### Purport

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was a little embarrassed by the Bhaṭṭācārya’s statement; therefore He uttered the name Viṣṇu to save Himself. The Lord herein confirms that if one is overestimated, glorification is just another form of blasphemy. In this way He protests this so-called offensive statement.
