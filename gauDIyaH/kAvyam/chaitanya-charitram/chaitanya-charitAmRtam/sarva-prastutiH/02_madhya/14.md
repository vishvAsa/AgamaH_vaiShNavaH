CHAPTER FOURTEEN

Dressing himself as a Vaiṣṇava, Mahārāja Pratāparudra entered the garden at Balagaṇḍi alone and began reciting verses from *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.* He then took the opportunity to massage the lotus feet of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. The Lord, in His ecstatic love for Kṛṣṇa, immediately embraced the King and thus bestowed mercy upon him. When there was an offering of *prasādam* in the garden, Lord Caitanya also partook of it. After this, when Lord Jagannātha’s *ratha* car stopped moving, King Pratāparudra called for many elephants to pull it, but they were unsuccessful. Seeing this, Lord Caitanya began to push the car from behind with His head, and the car began moving. Then the devotees began pulling the car with ropes. Near the Guṇḍicā temple is a place known as Āiṭoṭā. This place was fixed up for Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu to rest in. When Lord Jagannātha was seated at Sundarācala, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu saw it as Vṛndāvana. He performed sporting pastimes in the water of the lake known as Indradyumna. For nine continuous days during Ratha-yātrā, the Lord remained at Sundarācala, and on the fifth day He and Svarūpa Dāmodara observed the pastimes of Lakṣmī, the goddess of fortune. During that time, there was much talk about the pastimes of the *gopīs.* When the *ratha* was again being drawn and the chanting resumed, two devotees from Kulīna-grāma — Rāmānanda Vasu and Satyarāja Khān — were requested to bring silk ropes every year for the Ratha-yātrā ceremony.

### Translation

### Purport

Sometimes members of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness — especially in the Western countries — find it difficult to approach people to distribute books because people are unfamiliar with the traditional saffron robes of the devotees. The devotees have therefore inquired whether they can wear European and American dress before the general public. From the instructions given to King Pratāparudra by Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya, we can understand that we may change our dress in any way to facilitate our service. When our members change their dress to meet the public or to introduce our books, they are not breaking the devotional principles. The real principle is to spread the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, and if one has to change into regular Western dress for this purpose, there should be no objection.

### Translation

**How powerful is the mercy of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu! Without even inquiring about the King, the Lord made everything successful.**

### Purport

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s mercy is so powerful that it acts automatically. If a person renders loving service to Kṛṣṇa, it never goes in vain. It is recorded in a spiritual account, and in due time it will fructify. This is confirmed by the *Bhagavad-gītā* (2.40):

*nehābhikrama-nāśo ’sti* *pratyavāyo na vidyate  
sv-alpam apy asya dharmasya* *trāyate mahato bhayāt*

“In this endeavor there is no loss or diminution, and a little advancement on this path can protect one from the most dangerous type of fear.”

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu has particularly bestowed upon all fallen souls in this age the most potent method of devotional service — *saṅkīrtana,* the congregational chanting of the Lord’s holy name — and whoever takes to it through the mercy of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is immediately elevated to the transcendental position. As *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (11.5.32) recommends, *yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana-prāyair yajanti hi su-medhasaḥ*.

A student of Kṛṣṇa consciousness must receive Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s mercy; then his devotional service will quickly succeed. This was the case with King Pratāparudra. One has to be noticed by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and a little service with sincere efforts will convince the Lord that one is a proper candidate for returning home, back to Godhead. At first Mahārāja Pratāparudra did not have a chance to meet Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, but when the Lord saw that the King was serving Lord Jagannātha as a menial sweeper, the Lord’s mercy upon the King became a solid fact. When Mahārāja Pratāparudra, in the dress of a Vaiṣṇava, was serving the Lord, the Lord did not even inquire who he was. Rather, He had compassion upon him and embraced him.

Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī wants to point out that nothing could compare to the Lord’s mercy toward Mahārāja Pratāparudra; therefore he uses the word *dekha* (“just see”) and *caitanyera kṛpā-mahābala* (“how powerful is the mercy of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu”). This is also confirmed by Prabodhānanda Sarasvatī: *yat-kāruṇya-kaṭākṣa-vaibhava-vatām* (*Caitanya-candrāmṛta* 5). Even a little of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s mercy serves as a great asset for spiritual advancement. Therefore the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement must be spread through the mercy of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. When Rūpa Gosvāmī experienced the mercy and magnanimity of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, he said:

*namo mahā-vadānyāya* *kṛṣṇa-prema-pradāya te  
kṛṣṇāya kṛṣṇa-caitanya-* *nāmne gaura-tviṣe namaḥ*

“I offer my respectful obeisances unto the Supreme Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya, who is more magnanimous than any other *avatāra,* even Kṛṣṇa Himself, because He is bestowing freely what no one else has ever given — pure love of Kṛṣṇa.” Śrīla Locana dāsa Ṭhākura has also sung, *parama karuṇa, pahuṅ dui jana, nitāi-gauracandra:* “The two brothers Nitāi and Gaura are so kind that no one can compare to Them.” Similarly, Śrīla Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura has sung:

*vrajendra-nandana yei,* *śacī-suta haila sei,  
balarāma ha-ila nitāi,  
dīna-hīna yata chila,* *hari-nāme uddhārila,  
tā’ra sākṣī jagāi-mādhāi*

“Just to deliver all the sinful persons of this age by propagating the chanting of the holy name, Lord Kṛṣṇa and Lord Balarāma have advented as Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and Nityānanda Prabhu. Jagāi and Mādhāi are evidence of Their success.”

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s special mission is the deliverance of all fallen souls in Kali-yuga. Devotees of Kṛṣṇa must persistently seek the favor and mercy of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu to become fit to return home, back to Godhead.

राजा कहे, — आमि तोमार दासेर अनुदास ।

### Verse text

*rājā kahe, — āmi tomāra dāsera anudāsa  
bhṛtyera bhṛtya kara, — ei mora āśa*

### Synonyms

*rājā* *kahe* — the King said; *āmi* — I; *tomāra* — Your; *dāsera* *anudāsa* — most obedient servant of Your servants; *bhṛtyera* *bhṛtya* — servant of the servants; *kara* — make (me); *ei* — this; *mora* *āśa* — my desire.

### Translation

**The King replied, “My Lord, I am the most obedient servant of Your servants. It is my ambition that You will accept me as the servant of Your servants.”**

### Purport

The greatest achievement for a devotee is to become a servant of the servants of the Lord. Actually, no one should desire to become the direct servant of the Lord. That is not a very good idea. When Prahlāda Mahārāja was offered a benediction by Nṛsiṁhadeva, Prahlāda rejected all kinds of material benedictions, but he prayed to become the servant of the servants of the Lord. When Dhruva Mahārāja was offered a benediction by Kuvera, the treasurer of the demigods, Dhruva could have asked for unlimited material opulence, but he simply asked for the benediction of becoming the servant of the servants of the Lord. Kholāvecā Śrīdhara was a very poor man, but when Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu wanted to give him a benediction, he also prayed to the Lord to be allowed to remain a servant of the servants of the Lord. The conclusion is that being the servant of the servants of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the highest benediction one can desire.

### Translation

**Seeing the Lord’s special mercy upon King Pratāparudra, the devotees praised the King’s good fortune, and their minds became open and blissful.**

### Purport

This is characteristic of a pure Vaiṣṇava. He is never envious if another devotee receives the mercy and strength of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. A pure Vaiṣṇava is very happy to see a person elevated in devotional service. Unfortunately, there are many so-called Vaiṣṇavas who become envious to see someone actually recognized by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. It is a fact that no one can preach Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s message without receiving the special mercy of the Lord. This is known to every Vaiṣṇava. Yet there are some envious people who cannot tolerate the expansion of this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement all over the world. They find fault with the preacher who has spread this movement and do not praise him for the excellent service he has rendered in fulfilling Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s mission.

### Purport

Following in the footsteps of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, a Vaiṣṇava should be fully satisfied simply to see a variety of food offered to the Deity of Jagannātha or Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa. A Vaiṣṇava should not hunger for a variety of food for his own sake; rather, his satisfaction is in seeing various foods being offered to the Deity. In his *Gurv-aṣṭaka,* Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura writes:

*catur-vidha-śrī-bhagavat-prasāda- *
 *svādv-anna-tṛptān hari-bhakta-saṅghān  
kṛtvaiva tṛptiṁ bhajataḥ sadaiva *
 *vande guroḥ śrī-caraṇāravindam*

“The spiritual master is always offering Kṛṣṇa four kinds of delicious food \[analyzed as that which is licked, chewed, drunk and sucked\]. When the spiritual master sees that the devotees are satisfied by eating *bhagavat-prasādam,* he is satisfied. I offer my respectful obeisances unto the lotus feet of such a spiritual master.”

The spiritual master’s duty is to engage his disciples in preparing varieties of nice foods to offer the Deity. After being offered, this food is distributed as *prasādam* to the devotees. These activities satisfy the spiritual master, although he himself does not eat or require such a variety of *prasādam.* By seeing to the offering and distribution of *prasādam,* he himself is encouraged in devotional service.

### Translation

**Observing the beggars eating prasādam, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu chanted, “Haribol!” and instructed them to chant the holy name.**

### Purport

In a song, Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura chants:

*miche māyāra vaśe,* *yāccha bhese’,  
khāccha hābuḍubu, bhāi  
jīva kṛṣṇa-dāsa,* *e viśvāsa,  
ka’rle ta’ āra duḥkha nāi*

“O people! Why are you being captivated by the waves of the ocean of nescience? If you would immediately accept Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa as your eternal master, there would be no chance of being carried away by the waves of illusion. Then all your sufferings would stop.” Kṛṣṇa conducts the material world under the three modes of material nature, and consequently there are three platforms of life — higher, middle and lower. On whatever platform one may be situated, one is tossed by the waves of material nature. Someone may be rich, someone may be middle class, and someone may be a poor beggar — it doesn’t matter. As long as one is under the spell of the three modes of material nature, he must continue to experience these divisions.

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu therefore advised the beggars to chant “Haribol!” while taking *prasādam.* Chanting means accepting one’s self as the eternal servant of Kṛṣṇa. This is the only solution, regardless of social position. Everyone is suffering under the spell of *māyā;* therefore the best course is to learn how to get out of the clutches of *māyā.* How to do so is stated by Kṛṣṇa in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (14.26):

*māṁ ca yo ’vyabhicāreṇa* *bhakti-yogena sevate  
sa guṇān samatītyaitān* *brahma-bhūyāya kalpate*

“One who engages in full devotional service, unfailing in all circumstances, at once transcends the modes of material nature and thus comes to the level of Brahman.”

One can overcome the spell of *māyā* and attain the transcendental platform by agreeing to engage in the devotional service of the Lord. Devotional service begins with *śravaṇaṁ kīrtanam;* therefore Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu advised the beggars to chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra* for elevation to the transcendental position. On the transcendental platform, there is no distinction between the rich, the middle class and the poor.

### Translation

**As soon as the beggars chanted the holy name, “Haribol,” they were immediately absorbed in ecstatic love of Godhead. In this way Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu performed wonderful pastimes.**

### Purport

To feel the emotion of ecstatic love of God is to be on the transcendental platform. If one can keep himself in that transcendental position, he will surely return home, back to Godhead. In the spiritual world there are no higher, middle or lower classes. This is confirmed in the *Īśopaniṣad* (7):

*yasmin sarvāṇi bhūtāny* *ātmaivābhūd vijānataḥ  
tatra ko mohaḥ kaḥ śoka* *ekatvam anupaśyataḥ*

“One who always sees all living entities as spiritual sparks, in quality one with the Lord, becomes a true knower of things. What, then, can be illusion or anxiety for him?”

One should not compare Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s *vṛndāvana-vihāra* in the garden of Jagannātha with the activities of the *gaurāṅga-nāgarīs.*

The word *pañcamī* means “the fifth day” and is used because this takes place on the fifth day of the moon.

She becomes very angry with her husband and attacks Him with her great opulence.”

*Rasābhāsa* occurs when one’s relationship with Kṛṣṇa is adulterated. There are different types of *rasābhāsa* — first class, second class and third class. The word *rasa* means “mellow,” and *ābhāsa* means “a shadow.” If one tastes one kind of mellow and something extra is imposed, that is *uparasa.* If something is derived from the original mellow, it is called *anurasa.* If something is appreciated that is far removed from the original mellow, it is called *aparasa. Uparasa, anurasa* and *aparasa* are, respectively, first-, second- and third-class *rasābhāsas.* As stated in the *Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu* (4.9.1-2):

*pūrvam evānuśiṣṭena* *vikalā rasa-lakṣaṇā

### Purport

This verse is a quotation from *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (10.33.25). The *gopīs* are all transcendental spirit souls. One should never think that the *gopīs* and Kṛṣṇa have material bodies. Vṛndāvana-dhāma is also a spiritual abode, and there the days and nights, the trees, flowers and water, and everything else are spiritual. There is not even a trace of material contamination. Kṛṣṇa, who is the Supreme Brahman and Supersoul, is not at all interested in anything material. His activities with the *gopīs* are all spiritual and take place within the spiritual world. They have nothing to do with the material world. Lord Kṛṣṇa’s lusty desires and all His dealings with the *gopīs* are on the spiritual platform. One has to be transcendentally realized before even considering relishing the pastimes of Kṛṣṇa with the *gopīs.* One who is on the mundane platform must first purify himself by following the regulative principles. Only then can he try to understand Kṛṣṇa and the *gopīs.* Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and Svarūpa Dāmodara Gosvāmī are here talking about the relationship between Kṛṣṇa and the *gopīs;* therefore the subject matter is neither mundane nor erotic. Being a *sannyāsī,* Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was very strict in His dealings with women. Unless the *gopīs* were on the spiritual platform, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu would have never even mentioned them to Svarūpa Dāmodara Gosvāmī. Therefore these descriptions do not at all pertain to material activity.

The left wing and right wing of the *gopīs* has been explained by Rūpa Gosvāmī in his *Ujjvala-nīlamaṇi* (*Sakhī-prakaraṇa* 26 and 32). The left wing is described in this way:

*māna-grahe sadodyuktā* *tac-chaithilye ca kopanā  
abhedyā nāyake prāyaḥ* *krūrā vāmeti kīrtyate*

“A *gopī* who is always eager to be jealously angered, who is very enthusiastic for that position, who immediately becomes angry when defeated, who is never under the control of a hero, and who always opposes Him is called a *vāmā,* or a left-wing *gopī.*”

Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī describes the right-wing *gopīs* in this way:

*asahyā māna-nirbandhe* *nāyake yukta-vādinī  
sāmabhis tena bhedyā ca* *dakṣiṇā parikīrtitā*

“A *gopī* who cannot tolerate womanly anger, who speaks suitable words to the hero, and who is satisfied by His sweet words is called a *dakṣiṇā,* or a right-wing *gopī.*”

### Purport

Whenever Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī leaves Her house, She is always well dressed and attractive. It is Her womanly nature to attract Śrī Kṛṣṇa’s attention, and upon seeing Her so attractively dressed, Śrī Kṛṣṇa desires to touch Her body. The Lord then finds some fault in Her and prohibits Her from going to a river crossing and stops Her from picking flowers. Such are the pastimes between Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī and Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Being a cowherd girl, Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī regularly carries milk in a container and often goes to sell the milk on the other side of the Yamunā. To cross the river, She has to pay the boatman, and the spot where the boatman collects his fares is called the *dāna-ghāṭi.* Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa stops Her from going, telling Her, “First You have to pay the fee; then You will be allowed to go.” This pastime is called *dāna-keli-līlā.* Similarly, if Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī wants to pick a flower, Śrī Kṛṣṇa claims to be the garden’s proprietor and prohibits Her. This pastime is called *kila-kiñcita.* Rādhārāṇī’s shyness arises due to Śrī Kṛṣṇa’s prohibitions, and ecstatic loving bodily symptoms called *kila-kiñcita-bhāva* are manifest at this time. These ecstatic symptoms are explained in the following verse, which is from Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī’s *Ujjvala-nīlamaṇi* (*Anubhāva-prakaraṇa* 39).
