CHAPTER ELEVEN

Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura summarizes the eleventh chapter in his *Amṛta-pravāha-bhāṣya.* When Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya tried his best to arrange a meeting between Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and King Pratāparudra, the Lord flatly denied his request. At this time Śrī Rāmānanda Rāya returned from his governmental post, and he praised King Pratāparudra highly in Lord Caitanya’s presence. Because of this, the Lord became a little soft. The King also made promises to Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya, who hinted how the King might meet the Lord. During Anavasara, while Lord Jagannātha was resting for fifteen days, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, being unable to see Lord Jagannātha, went to Ālālanātha. Later, when the devotees from Bengal came to see Him, He returned to Jagannātha Purī. While Advaita Ācārya and the other devotees were coming to Jagannātha Purī, Svarūpa Dāmodara and Govinda, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s two personal assistants, went to receive all the devotees with garlands. From the roof of his palace, King Pratāparudra could see all the devotees arriving. Gopīnātha Ācārya stood on the roof with the King, and, following Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya’s instructions, identified each and every devotee. The King discussed the devotees with Gopīnātha Ācārya, and he mentioned that the devotees were accepting *prasādam* without observing the regulative principles governing pilgrimages. They accepted *prasādam* without having shaved, and they neglected to fast in a holy place. After Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya had explained to the King why the devotees had apparently violated the scriptural injunctions for visiting a place of pilgrimage, the King arranged residential quarters for all the devotees and saw to their *prasādam.* Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu talked very happily with Vāsudeva Datta and other devotees. Haridāsa Ṭhākura also came, and due to his humble and submissive attitude, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu gave him a nice solitary place near the temple. After this, the Lord began performing *saṅkīrtana,* dividing all the devotees into four groups. After *saṅkīrtana,* all the devotees left for their residential quarters.

### Purport

This is a quotation from *Śrī Caitanya-candrodaya-nāṭaka* (8.23). Thus Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu enunciates the principles for a *sannyāsī* renouncing the material world for spiritual advancement. Spiritual advancement is not meant for magic shows and jugglery but for crossing the material world and being transferred to the spiritual world. *Pāraṁ paraṁ jigamiṣoḥ* means desiring to go to the other side of the material world. There is a river called Vaitaraṇī, and on one side of this river is the material world, and on the other side is the spiritual world. Since the Vaitaraṇī River is compared to a great ocean, it is named *bhava-sāgara,* the ocean of repeated birth and death. Spiritual life aims at stopping this repetition of birth and death and entering into the spiritual world, where one can live eternally cognizant and blissful.

Unfortunately, the general populace does not know anything about spiritual life or the spiritual world. The spiritual world is mentioned in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (8.20):

*paras tasmāt tu bhāvo ’nyo* *’vyakto ’vyaktāt sanātanaḥ  
yaḥ sa sarveṣu bhūteṣu* *naśyatsu na vinaśyati*

“Yet there is another unmanifested nature, which is eternal and is transcendental to this manifested and unmanifested matter. It is supreme and is never annihilated. When all in this world is annihilated, that part remains as it is.”

Thus there is a spiritual nature beyond this material world, and that spiritual nature exists eternally. Spiritual advancement means stopping material activities and entering into spiritual activities. This is the process of *bhakti-yoga.* In the material world, the via media for sense gratification is mainly a woman. One who is seriously interested in spiritual life should strictly avoid women. A *sannyāsī* should never see a man or a woman for material benefit. In addition, talks with materialistic men and women are also dangerous, and they are compared to drinking poison. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was very strict on this point. He therefore refused to see King Pratāparudra, who was naturally always engaged in political and economic affairs. The Lord even refused to see the King despite the request of a personality like Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya, who was the Lord’s intimate friend and devotee.

प्रभु कहे, — तथापि राजा कालसर्पाकार ।  
काष्ठनारी-स्पर्शे यैछे उपजे विकार ॥ १० ॥

### Verse text

*prabhu kahe, — tathāpi rājā kāla-sarpākāra  
kāṣṭha-nārī-sparśe yaiche upaje vikāra*

### Synonyms

*prabhu* *kahe* — Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu replied; *tathāpi* — still; *rājā* — the King; *kāla*-*sarpa*-*ākāra* — just like a venomous snake; *kāṣṭha*-*nārī* — a woman made of wood; *sparśe* — by touching; *yaiche* — as; *upaje* — arises; *vikāra* — agitation.

### Translation

**Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, “Although it is correct that the King is a great devotee, he is still to be considered a venomous snake. Similarly, even though a woman be made of wood, one becomes agitated simply by touching her form.**

### Purport

Śrī Cāṇakya Paṇḍita has stated in his moral instructions: *tyaja durjana-saṁsargaṁ bhaja sādhu-samāgamam.* This means that one has to abandon the association of materialistic people and associate with spiritually advanced people. However qualified a materialist may be, he is no better than a venomous serpent. Everyone knows that a snake is dangerous and poisonous, and when its hood is decorated with jewels, it is no less poisonous or dangerous. However qualified a materialist may be, he is no better than a snake decorated with jewels. One should therefore be careful in dealing with such materialists, just as one would be careful in dealing with a bejeweled serpent.

Even though a woman be made of wood or stone, she becomes attractive when decorated. One becomes sexually agitated even by touching the form. Therefore one should not trust his mind, which is so fickle that it can give way to enemies at any moment. The mind is always accompanied by six enemies — namely, *kāma, krodha, mada, moha, mātsarya* and *bhaya* — that is, lust, anger, intoxication, illusion, envy and fear. Although the mind may be merged in spiritual consciousness, one should always be very careful in dealing with it, just as one is careful in dealing with a snake. One should never think that his mind is trained and that he can do whatever he likes. One interested in spiritual life should always engage his mind in the service of the Lord so that the enemies of the mind, who always accompany the mind, will be subdued. If the mind is not engaged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness at every moment, there is a chance that it will give way to its enemies. In this way we become victims of the mind.

Chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra* engages the mind at the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa constantly; thus the mind’s enemies do not have a chance to strike. Following Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s example in these verses, we should be very careful in dealing with the mind, which should not be indulged in any circumstance. Once we indulge the mind, it can create havoc in this life, even though we may be spiritually advanced. The mind is specifically agitated through the association of materialistic men and women. Therefore Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, through His personal behavior, warns everyone to avoid meeting a materialistic person or a woman.

### Purport

King Pratāparudra requested an interview with Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu through the Bhaṭṭācārya, who duly submitted the request. The Lord, however, immediately refused this interview. Now when Rāmānanda Rāya informed the Lord how eager the King was to see Him, the Lord was immediately pleased. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu requested Rāmānanda Rāya to retire from his government post and come to Śrī Puruṣottama-kṣetra (Jagannātha Purī) to live with Him. When this proposal was submitted to King Pratāparudra, he immediately accepted it and also encouraged Rāmānanda Rāya by allowing him a full pension. This was very much appreciated by the Lord, and this confirms the fact that the Lord is more pleased when one serves the servant of the Lord. In ordinary parlance it is said, “If you love me, love my dog.” To approach the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one has to go through His confidential servant. This is the method. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu clearly says, “Because the King loves you, Rāmānanda Rāya, he is very fortunate. Kṛṣṇa will certainly accept him due to his love for you.”

आराधनानां सर्वेषां विष्णोराराधनं परम् ।

### Verse text

*ārādhanānāṁ sarveṣāṁ  
viṣṇor ārādhanaṁ param  
tasmāt parataraṁ devi  
tadīyānāṁ samarcanam*

### Synonyms

*ārādhanānām* — of varieties of worship; *sarveṣām* — all; *viṣṇoḥ* — of Lord Viṣṇu; *ārādhanam* — worship; *param* — the most exalted; *tasmāt* — and above such worship of Lord Viṣṇu; *parataram* — of greater value; *devi* — O goddess; *tadīyānām* — of persons in relationship with Lord Viṣṇu; *samarcanam* — rigid and firm worship.

### Translation

**“\[Lord Śiva told the goddess Durgā:\] ‘My dear Devī, although the Vedas recommend worship of demigods, the worship of Lord Viṣṇu is topmost. However, above the worship of Lord Viṣṇu is the rendering of service to Vaiṣṇavas, who are related to Lord Viṣṇu.’**

### Purport

The *Vedas* are divided into three divisions — *karma-kāṇḍa, jñāna-kāṇḍa* and *upāsanā-kāṇḍa.* These are activities dealing with fruitive work, empiric philosophical speculation and worship. There are recommendations in the *Vedas* for the worship of various demigods as well as Lord Viṣṇu. In this quotation from the *Padma Purāṇa,* Lord Śiva answers a question posed to him by goddess Durgā*.* This verse is also included in the *Laghu-bhāgavatāmṛta* (2.4), by Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī. The words *viṣṇor ārādhanam* refer to the worship of Lord Viṣṇu, or Kṛṣṇa. Thus the supreme form of worship is the satisfaction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Śrī Kṛṣṇa. It is further concluded that the worshiper of Lord Viṣṇu renders better service by worshiping the devotee of Lord Kṛṣṇa. There are different types of devotees — those in *śānta-rasa, dāsya-rasa, sakhya-rasa, vātsalya-rasa* and *mādhurya-rasa.* Although all the *rasas* are on the transcendental platform, *mādhurya-rasa* is the supreme transcendental mellow. Consequently it is concluded that the worship of devotees engaged in the Lord’s service in *mādhurya-rasa* is the supreme spiritual activity. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and His followers mainly worship Lord Kṛṣṇa in *mādhurya-rasa.* Other Vaiṣṇava *ācāryas* recommended worship up to *vātsalya-rasa.* Therefore Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī in his *Vidagdha-mādhava* (1.2) describes Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s cult as supreme:

*anarpita-carīṁ cirāt karuṇayāvatīrṇaḥ kalau *
 *samarpayitum unnatojjvala-rasāṁ sva-bhakti-śriyam*

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu appeared in this Age of Kali to exhibit the superexcellence of *mādhurya-rasa,* a gift never previously bestowed by any *ācārya* or incarnation. Consequently Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is accepted as the most magnanimous incarnation. It is He only who distributed love of Kṛṣṇa while exhibiting the superexcellence of loving Kṛṣṇa in the conjugal *rasa.*

### Translation

**Rāmānanda Rāya said, “The legs are like the chariot, and the heart is like the charioteer. Wherever the heart takes the living entity, the living entity is obliged to go.”**

### Purport

In the *Bhagavad-gītā* (18.61) Lord Kṛṣṇa explains:

*īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ* *hṛd-deśe ’rjuna tiṣṭhati  
bhrāmayan sarva-bhūtāni* *yantrārūḍhāni māyayā*

“The Supreme Lord is situated in everyone’s heart, O Arjuna, and is directing the wanderings of all living entities, who are seated as on a machine made of material energy.”

Thus the living entity wanders within this universe riding upon a chariot (the body) bestowed by material nature. A similar explanation is given in the *Kaṭha Upaniṣad* (1.3.3-4):

*ātmānaṁ rathinaṁ viddhi* *śarīraṁ ratham eva tu  
buddhiṁ tu sārathiṁ viddhi* *manaḥ pragraham eva ca*

*indriyāṇi hayān āhur* *viṣayāṁs teṣu gocarān  
ātmendriya-mano-yuktaṁ* *bhoktety āhur manīṣiṇaḥ*

Here it is said that the living entity is the passenger riding in the chariot of the body, which is offered by material nature. The intelligence is the charioteer, the mind constitutes the reins controlling the horses, and the senses are the horses. Thus the living entity is the false enjoyer of the material world.

One who is advanced in Kṛṣṇa consciousness can control the mind and intelligence and in this way rein in the horses, the senses, even though they are very powerful. One who can control the senses by his mind and intelligence can very easily approach the Supreme Personality of Godhead, or Viṣṇu, who is the ultimate goal of life. *Tad viṣṇoḥ paramaṁ padaṁ sadā paśyanti sūrayaḥ.* Those who are actually advanced approach Lord Viṣṇu, their ultimate goal. Such people are never captivated by Lord Viṣṇu’s external energy, the material world.

### Translation

**“Alas, has Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu incarnated to deliver all kinds of sinners with the exception of a king named Mahārāja Pratāparudra?**

### Purport

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s mission is thus described by Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura: *patita-pāvana-hetu tava avatāra/ mo-sama patita prabhu nā pāibe āra.* If Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu descended to reclaim sinners, then one who is the most sinful and lowborn is the first candidate for the Lord’s consideration. Mahārāja Pratāparudra considered himself a most fallen soul because he had to deal with material things constantly and enjoy material profits. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s business was the deliverance of the most fallen. How, then, could He reject the King? The more fallen a person is, the more he has the right to be delivered by the Lord — provided, of course, he surrenders unto the Lord. Mahārāja Pratāparudra was a fully surrendered soul; therefore the Lord could not refuse him on the grounds that he was a worldly pounds-shillings man.

*tāṅra pratijñā — more nā karibe daraśana  
mora pratijñā — tāṅhā vinā chāḍiba jīvana*

### Synonyms

*tāṅra* *pratijñā* — His determination; *more* — unto me; *nā* — not; *karibe* — will do; *daraśana* — seeing; *mora* *pratijñā* — my promise; *tāṅhā* *vinā* — without Him; *chāḍiba* — I will give up; *jīvana* — life.

### Translation

**Mahārāja Pratāparudra continued, “If Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is determined not to see me, then I am determined to give up my life if I do not see Him.**

### Purport

A devotee with Mahārāja Pratāparudra’s determination will certainly be victorious in advancing in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Śrī Kṛṣṇa confirms this in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (9.14):

*satataṁ kīrtayanto māṁ* *yatantaś ca dṛḍha-vratāḥ  
namasyantaś ca māṁ bhaktyā* *nitya-yuktā upāsate*

“Always chanting My glories, endeavoring with great determination, bowing down before Me, these great souls perpetually worship Me with devotion.”

These are the symptoms of a *mahātmā* engaged in the Lord’s service in full Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Thus Mahārāja Pratāparudra’s determination is very much exalted and is called *dṛḍha-vrata.* Because of this determination, he was finally able to receive Lord Caitanya’s direct mercy.

*yadi sei mahāprabhura nā pāi kṛpā-dhana  
kibā rājya, kibā deha, — saba akāraṇa*

### Synonyms

*yadi* — if; *sei* — that; *mahāprabhura* — of Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu; *nā* — not; *pāi* — I get; *kṛpā*-*dhana* — the treasure of mercy; *kibā* *rājya* — what is the value of my kingdom; *kibā* *deha* — what is the value of this body; *saba* *akāraṇa* — everything useless.

### Translation

**“If I do not receive Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s mercy, my body and my kingdom are certainly useless.”**

### Purport

This is an excellent example of *dṛḍha-vrata,* determination. If one does not receive the Supreme Personality of Godhead’s mercy, one’s life is defeated. In *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (5.5.5) it is said: *parābhavas tāvad abodha-jāto yāvan na jijñāsata ātma-tattvam.* Unless one inquires into spiritual life, everything is useless. Without spiritual inquiry, our labor and the object of our labor are simply a waste of time.

rājāra anurāga dekhi’ ha-ilā vismita*

### Synonyms

*eta* *śuni’* — hearing this; *sārvabhauma* — Sārvabhauma; *ha*-*ilā* — became; *cintita* — very thoughtful; *rājāra* — of the King; *anurāga* — attachment; *dekhi’* — seeing; *ha*-*ilā* — became; *vismita* — astonished.

### Translation

**Hearing King Pratāparudra’s determination, Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya became thoughtful. Indeed, he was very much astonished to see the King’s determination.**

### Purport

Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya was astonished because such determination is not possible for a worldly man attached to material enjoyment. The King certainly had ample opportunity for material enjoyment, but he was thinking that his kingdom and everything else was useless if he could not see Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. This is certainly sufficient cause for astonishment. In *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* it is stated that *bhakti,* devotional service, must be unconditional. No material impediments can actually check the advancement of devotional service, be it executed by a common man or a king. In any case, devotional service rendered to the Lord is always complete, despite the devotee’s material position. Devotional service is so exalted that it can be executed by anyone in any position. One must simply be *dṛḍha-vrata,* firmly determined.

*bhaṭṭācārya kahe — deva nā kara viṣāda  
tomāre prabhura avaśya ha-ibe prasāda*

### Synonyms

*bhaṭṭācārya* *kahe* — the Bhaṭṭācārya said; *deva* — O King; *nā* *kara* *viṣāda* — do not be worried; *tomāre* — unto you; *prabhura* — of Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu; *avaśya* — certainly; *ha*-*ibe* — there must be; *prasāda* — mercy.

### Translation

**Finally Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya said, “My dear King, do not worry. Because of your firm determination, I am sure that Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s mercy will definitely be bestowed upon you.”**

### Purport

Due to King Pratāparudra’s firm determination, the Bhaṭṭācārya predicted that the King would receive Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s mercy without fail. As confirmed elsewhere in *Caitanya-caritāmṛta* (*Madhya* 19.151), *guru-kṛṣṇa-prasāde pāya bhakti-latā-bīja:* “By the mercy of the spiritual master and Kṛṣṇa, one gets the seed of devotional service.” The Bhaṭṭācārya was the spiritual master of King Pratāparudra, and he gave his blessings to the effect that the Lord would be merciful upon the King. The mercy of the spiritual master and Kṛṣṇa combine to grant success to a devotee engaged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. This is confirmed by the *Vedas:*

*yasya deve parā bhaktir* *yathā deve tathā gurau  
tasyaite kathitā hy arthāḥ* *prakāśante mahātmanaḥ*

“Only unto those great souls who have implicit faith in both the Lord and the spiritual master are all the imports of Vedic knowledge automatically revealed.” (*Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad* 6.23)

Mahārāja Pratāparudra had firm faith in the Bhaṭṭācārya, who declared Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu to be the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Having firm faith in the Bhaṭṭācārya as his spiritual master, King Pratāparudra immediately accepted Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu as the Supreme Lord. Thus he began worshiping Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu in his mind. This is the process of devotional service. According to Lord Kṛṣṇa in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (9.34):

*man-manā bhava mad-bhakto* *mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru  
mām evaiṣyasi yuktvaivam* *ātmānaṁ mat-parāyaṇaḥ*

“Engage your mind always in thinking of Me, become My devotee, offer obeisances to Me and worship Me. Being completely absorbed in Me, surely you will come to Me.”

This process is very simple. One need only be firmly convinced by the spiritual master that Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If one decides this, he can make further progress by thinking of Kṛṣṇa, chanting of Kṛṣṇa and glorifying Him. There is then no doubt that such a fully surrendered devotee will receive the blessings of Lord Kṛṣṇa. Śrīla Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya explains this further.

### Translation

**As soon as the Bhaṭṭācārya saw the King’s firm determination, he declared, “The Supreme Lord is approached only by pure love. Your love for Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is very, very deep; therefore without a doubt He will be merciful upon you.”**

### Purport

Such determination is the first qualification. As confirmed by Rūpa Gosvāmī (*Upadeśāmṛta* 3): *utsāhān niścayād dhairyāt.* One must first have firm determination, firm faith. When one engages in devotional service, he must maintain this firm determination. Then Kṛṣṇa will be pleased with his service. The spiritual master can show the path of devotional service. If the disciple follows the principles rigidly and undeviatingly, he will certainly receive the mercy of Kṛṣṇa. This is confirmed by the *śāstras.*

### Purport

A Vaiṣṇava is always ready to help another Vaiṣṇava progress toward realization of the Absolute Truth. Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya could understand the King’s position as a pure Vaiṣṇava. The King was always thinking of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and the Bhaṭṭācārya wanted to help him approach the Lord. A Vaiṣṇava is always compassionate, especially when he sees a prospective devotee very determined (*dṛḍha-vrata*). Consequently the Bhaṭṭācārya was ready to help the King.

prabhu-āge kahite prabhura phiri’ gela mana*

### Synonyms

*rāmānanda* *rāya* — Rāmānanda Rāya; *āji* — today; *tomāra* — your; *prema*-*guṇa* — quality of love; *prabhu*-*āge* — in front of the Lord; *kahite* — when he described; *prabhura* — of Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu; *phiri’* *gela* — became changed; *mana* — the mind.

### Translation

**“The Lord has already changed His mind due to Rāmānanda Rāya’s description of your pure love for Him.”**

### Purport

At first the Lord did not want to see the King, but due to the Bhaṭṭācārya’s and Rāmānanda Rāya’s earnest endeavors, the Lord’s mind was changed. The Lord already declared that Kṛṣṇa would be merciful upon the King due to the King’s service to the devotees. This is the process by which one can advance in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. First there must be the devotee’s mercy; then Kṛṣṇa’s mercy will descend. *Yasya prasādād bhagavat-prasādo/ yasyāprasādān na gatiḥ kuto ’pi.* Our first duty, therefore, is to satisfy the spiritual master, who can arrange for the Lord’s mercy. A common man must first begin to serve the spiritual master, or the devotee. Then, through the mercy of the devotee, the Lord will be satisfied. Unless one receives the dust of a devotee’s lotus feet on one’s head, there is no possibility of advancement. This is also confirmed by a statement of Prahlāda Mahārāja’s in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (7.5.32):

*naiṣāṁ matis tāvad urukramāṅghriṁ *
 *spṛśaty anarthāpagamo yad-arthaḥ  
mahīyasāṁ pāda-rajo-’bhiṣekaṁ *
 *niṣkiñcanānāṁ na vṛṇīta yāvat*

Unless one approaches a pure devotee, he cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Mahārāja Pratāparudra worshiped both Rāmānanda Rāya and Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya. Thus he touched the lotus feet of pure devotees and was able thereby to approach Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu felt Lord Jagannātha’s absence from the temple very much.

### Purport

Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura, honoring the personal associates of Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, has sung as follows (*Prārthanā* 13):

*gaurāṅgera saṅgi-gaṇe* *nitya-siddha kari’ māne  
se yāya vrajendra-suta-pāśa*

One who is intelligent understands that all the personal associates and devotees of Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu are ever liberated. This means that because they are always engaged in the devotional service of the Lord, they do not belong to this material world. One who is engaged in the Lord’s devotional service twenty-four hours daily and never forgets the Lord is called *nitya-siddha.* Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī confirms this statement:

*īhā yasya harer dāsye* *karmaṇā manasā girā  
nikhilāsv apy avasthāsu* *jīvan-muktaḥ sa ucyate*

“A person acting in the service of Kṛṣṇa with body, mind, intelligence and words is a liberated person even within the material world, although he may be engaged in many so-called material activities.” (*Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu,* 1.2.187)

A devotee is always thinking of how better to serve Lord Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and how to broadcast His name, fame and qualities throughout the world. One who is *nitya-siddha* has no business other than broadcasting the glories of the Lord all over the world according to his ability. Such people are already associates of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Therefore Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura says, *nitya-siddha kari’ māne.* One should not think that because Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was personally present five hundred years ago, only His associates were liberated. Rather, Śrīla Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura says that anyone is a *nitya-siddha* if he acts on behalf of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu by spreading the glories of the holy name of the Lord. We should respect those devotees preaching the glories of the Lord as *nitya-siddha* and should not consider them conditioned.

*māṁ ca yo ’vyabhicāreṇa* *bhakti-yogena sevate  
sa guṇān samatītyaitān* *brahma-bhūyāya kalpate*

(Bg. 14.26)

One who has transcended the material modes of nature is said to be on the Brahman platform. That is also the platform of *nitya-siddha.* The *nitya-siddha* not only stays on the Brahman platform but also works on that platform. Simply by accepting the associates of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu as *nitya-siddha,* one can very easily go back home, back to Godhead.

Such are the symptoms of pure devotees when they are chanting. All the pure devotees are as bright as sunshine, and their bodily luster is very effulgent. In addition, their performance of *saṅkīrtana* is unparalleled. There are many professional chanters who can perform congregational chanting with various musical instruments in an artistic and musical way, but their chanting cannot be as attractive as the congregational chanting of pure devotees. If a devotee sticks strictly to the principles governing Vaiṣṇava behavior, his bodily luster will naturally be attractive, and his singing and chanting of the holy names of the Lord will be effective. People will appreciate such *kīrtana* without hesitation. Even dramas about the pastimes of Lord Caitanya or Śrī Kṛṣṇa should be played by devotees. Such dramas will immediately interest an audience and be full of potency. The students of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness should note these two points and try to apply these principles in their spreading of the Lord’s glories.

*aiche prema, aiche nṛtya, aiche hari-dhvani  
kāhāṅ nāhi dekhi, aiche kāhāṅ nāhi śuni*

### Synonyms

*aiche* — such; *prema* — ecstatic love; *aiche* *nṛtya* — such dancing; *aiche* *hari*-*dhvani* — such vibration of the chanting of the holy name; *kāhāṅ* — anywhere; *nāhi* *dekhi* — I have never seen; *aiche* — such; *kāhāṅ* — anywhere; *nāhi* *śuni* — I never heard.

### Translation

**“I have never before seen such ecstatic love, nor heard the vibration of the holy name of the Lord chanted in such a way, nor seen such dancing during saṅkīrtana.”**

### Purport

Because the temple of Lord Jagannātha is situated at Jagannātha Purī, many devotees from all parts of the world came to perform *saṅkīrtana* in glorification of the Lord. All these devotees were certainly seen and heard by Mahārāja Pratāparudra, but he herein admits that the *kīrtana* performed by the associates of the Lord was unique. He had never before heard such *saṅkīrtana* nor seen such attractive features manifest by the devotees. The members of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness should go to India during the birthday ceremony of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu at Māyāpur and perform *saṅkīrtana* congregationally. This will attract the attention of all the important personalities in India, just as the beauty, bodily luster and *saṅkīrtana* performance by the associates of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu attracted the attention of Mahārāja Pratāparudra. The associates of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu were unlimited during the Lord’s presence on this planet, but anyone who is pure in life and devoted to the mission of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is to be understood as a *nitya-siddha* associate of the Lord.

### Purport

Rascals propose that anyone can invent his own religious process, and this proposition is condemned herein. If one actually wants to become religious, he must take up the chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra.* The real meaning of religion is stated in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (6.3.19-22):

*dharmaṁ tu sākṣād-bhagavat-praṇītaṁ *
 *na vai vidur ṛṣayo nāpi devāḥ  
na siddha-mukhyā asurā manuṣyāh *
 *kutaś ca vidyādhara-cāraṇādayaḥ*

*svayambhūr nāradaḥ śambhuḥ* *kumāraḥ kapilo manuḥ  
prahlādo janako bhīṣmo* *balir vaiyāsakir vayam*

*dvādaśaite vijānīmo* *dharmaṁ bhāgavataṁ bhaṭāḥ  
guhyaṁ viśuddhaṁ durbodhaṁ* *yaṁ jñātvāmṛtam aśnute*

*etāvān eva loke ’smin* *puṁsāṁ dharmaḥ paraḥ smṛtaḥ  
bhakti-yogo bhagavati* *tan-nāma-grahaṇādibhiḥ*

The purport of these verses is that *dharma,* or religion, cannot be manufactured by a human being. Religion is the law or code of the Lord. Consequently religion cannot be manufactured even by great saintly persons, demigods or *siddha-mukhyas,* and what to speak of *asuras,* human beings, Vidyādharas, Cāraṇas, and so on. The principles of *dharma,* religion, come down in the *paramparā* system beginning with twelve personalities — namely, Lord Brahmā; the great saint Nārada; Lord Śiva; the four Kumāras; Kapila, the son of Devahūti; Svāyambhuva Manu; Prahlāda Mahārāja; King Janaka; grandfather Bhīṣma; Bali Mahārāja; Śukadeva Gosvāmī; and Yamarāja. The principles of religion are known to these twelve personalities. *Dharma* refers to the religious principles by which one can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. *Dharma* is very confidential, uncontaminated by any material influence, and very difficult for ordinary men to understand. However, if one actually understands *dharma,* he immediately becomes liberated and is transferred to the kingdom of God. *Bhāgavata-dharma,* or the principle of religion enunciated by the *paramparā* system, is the supreme principle of religion. In other words, *dharma* refers to the science of *bhakti-yoga,* which begins by the novice’s chanting the holy name of the Lord (*tan-nāma-grahaṇādibhiḥ*).

Therefore in this Age of Kali, as recommended here in the *Caitanya-caritāmṛta* (text 98), *kali-kāle dharma* — *kṛṣṇa-nāma- saṅkīrtana:* the chanting of the holy name of the Lord is the method of religion approved by all Vedic scriptures. In the next text of the *Caitanya-caritāmṛta,* quoted from *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (11.5.32), this principle is further stressed.

sei se tāṅhāre ‘kṛṣṇa’ kari’ la-ite pāre*

### Synonyms

*bhaṭṭa* *kahe* — Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya said; *tāṅra* *kṛpā* — of Lord Caitanya’s mercy; *leśa* — even a fraction; *haya* — there is; *yāṅre* — unto whom; *sei* *se* — that person only; *tāṅhāre* — Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu; *kṛṣṇa* *kari’* — accepting as Kṛṣṇa; *la*-*ite* *pāre* — can take up.

### Translation

**The Bhaṭṭācārya replied, “A person who has received but a small fraction of mercy from Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu can understand that He is Lord Kṛṣṇa. No one else can.**

### Purport

The *saṅkīrtana* movement can be spread by a person who is especially favored by Lord Kṛṣṇa (*kṛṣṇa-śakti vinā nahe tāra pravartana*). Without first obtaining the mercy of the Lord, one cannot spread the holy name of the Lord. One who can spread the Lord’s name is called *labdha-caitanya* in the words of Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī. The *labdha-caitanya* is one who has actually awakened his original consciousness, Kṛṣṇa consciousness. The influence of the pure devotees in Kṛṣṇa consciousness is such that it can awaken others to become immediately Kṛṣṇa conscious and engage themselves in the transcendental loving service of Kṛṣṇa. In this way the descendants of pure devotees increase, and Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu takes much pleasure in seeing the increase of His devotees. The word *su-medhasaḥ* means “sharply intelligent.” When one’s intelligence is sharp, he can increase the interests of common men in loving Caitanya Mahāprabhu and through Him in loving Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa. Those not interested in understanding Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu are simply material in their attempts at professional chanting and dancing for money, despite their supposed artistry. If one does not have full faith in Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, he cannot properly chant and dance in the *saṅkīrtana* movement. Artificial chanting and dancing may be due to sentiments or sentimental agitation, but this cannot help one advance in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

### Translation

**“If the mercy of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is not bestowed upon a person — regardless of how learned a scholar that person may be and regardless of his seeing or listening — he cannot accept Lord Caitanya as the Supreme Personality of Godhead.**

### Purport

The same principles can be applied to demoniac persons, even though they be in the *sampradāya* of Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Without receiving the Lord’s special power, one cannot preach His glories all over the world. Even though one may celebrate himself as a learned follower of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and even though one may attempt to preach the holy name of the Lord all over the world, if he is not favored by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu he will find fault with the pure devotee and will not be able to understand how a preacher is empowered by Lord Caitanya. One must be considered bereft of the mercy of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu when he criticizes the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement now spreading all over the world or finds fault with this movement or the leader of the movement.

### Translation

**The Bhaṭṭācārya told the King, “What you have said is right according to the regulative principles governing the visiting of holy places, but there is another path, which is the path of spontaneous love. According to those principles, there are subtle intricacies involved in the execution of religious principles.**

### Purport

According to the Vedic regulative principles, one has to be celibate before entering a holy place of pilgrimage. Generally people are very much addicted to sense gratification, and unless they have sex at night, they cannot sleep. The regulative principles therefore enjoin that before a common man goes to a holy place of pilgrimage, he should observe complete celibacy. As soon as one enters a holy place, he must observe fasting for the day, and after shaving his head clean, he must take a bath in a river or ocean near the holy place. These methods are adopted to neutralize the effects of sinful activities. Visiting a holy place of pilgrimage means neutralizing the reactions of a sinful life. Those who go to holy places of pilgrimage actually unload the reactions of their sinful lives, and consequently holy places are overloaded with sinful activities left there by visitors.

When a saintly person or pure devotee visits such a holy place, he absorbs the sinful effects left by the common men and again purifies the holy place. *Tīrthī-kurvanti tīrthāni* (*Bhāg.* 1.13.10). Therefore a common man’s visit to a holy place and an exalted saintly person’s visit there are different. The common man leaves his sins in the holy place, and a saintly person or devotee cleanses these sins simply by his presence. The devotees of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu were not common men, and they could not be subjected to the rules and regulations governing the visiting of holy places. Rather, they exhibited their spontaneous love for Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Immediately upon arrival at the holy place, they went to see Lord Caitanya, and by His order they took *mahā-prasādam* without following the regulations governing holy places.

याँरे कृपा करि’ करेन हृदय़े प्रेरण ।  
कृष्णाश्रय़ हय़, छाड़े वेद-लोक-धर्म ॥ ११७ ॥

### Verse text

*yāṅre kṛpā kari’ karena hṛdaye preraṇa  
kṛṣṇāśraya haya, chāḍe veda-loka-dharma*

### Synonyms

*yāṅre* — in whomever; *kṛpā* — mercy; *kari’* — bestowing; *karena* — does; *hṛdaye* — in the heart; *preraṇa* — inspiration; *kṛṣṇa*-*āśraya* — shelter of Lord Kṛṣṇa; *haya* — there is; *chāḍe* — he gives up; *veda* — Vedic principles; *loka*-*dharma* — social etiquette.

### Translation

**“The man to whom the Lord shows His mercy by inspiring him within the heart takes shelter only of Lord Kṛṣṇa and abandons all Vedic and social customs.**

### Purport

This is also the teaching of Lord Kṛṣṇa in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (18.66):

*sarva-dharmān parityajya* *mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja  
ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo* *mokṣayiṣyāmi mā śucaḥ*

“Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. I shall deliver you from all sinful reactions. Do not fear.” Such firm faith in the Supreme Personality of Godhead is possible only by the mercy of the Lord. The Lord is sitting within everyone’s heart, and when He personally inspires His devotee, the devotee does not stick to the Vedic principles or social customs but rather devotes himself to the transcendental loving service of the Lord. This is confirmed in the following verse from *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (4.29.46).

### Purport

This instruction (*Bhāg.* 4.29.46) was given by Nārada Gosvāmī to King Prācīnabarhi in connection with the story of Purañjana. Here Nārada implies that without the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead one cannot extricate himself from the fruitive activities that are under the jurisdiction of the *Vedas.* In previous verses (*Bhāg.* 4.29.42-44) Nārada admits that even personalities like Lord Brahmā, Lord Śiva, Manu, the Prajāpatis (headed by Dakṣa), the four Kumāras, Marīci, Atri, Aṅgirā, Pulastya, Pulaha, Kratu, Bhṛgu, Vasiṣṭha and even Nārada himself could not properly receive the causeless mercy of the Lord.

### Purport

This is verse 21 from the *Stotra-ratna,* composed by Ālabandāru Yāmunācārya. One’s relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead may be reestablished even after one has fallen into the ocean of nescience, which is the ocean of material existence involving the repetition of birth, death, old age and disease, all arising out of the acceptance of the material body. There are 8,400,000 species of material life, but in the human body one attains a chance to get release from the repetition of birth and death. When one becomes the Lord’s devotee, he is rescued from this dangerous ocean of birth and death. The Lord is always prepared to shower His mercy upon fallen souls struggling against miserable material conditions. As Lord Kṛṣṇa states in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (15.7):

*mamaivāṁśo jīva-loke* *jīva-bhūtaḥ sanātanaḥ  
manaḥ-ṣaṣṭhānīndriyāṇi* *prakṛti-sthāni karṣati*

“The living entities in this conditioned world are My eternal fragmental parts. Due to conditioned life, they are struggling very hard with the six senses, which include the mind.”

Thus every living being is struggling hard in this material nature. Actually the living entity is part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, and when he surrenders unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he attains release from the ocean of birth and death. The Lord, being very kind to fallen souls, is always anxious to get the living entity out of the ocean of nescience. If the living entity understands his position and surrenders to the Lord, his life becomes successful.

### Purport

Although Haridāsa Ṭhākura was such a highly exalted Vaiṣṇava that he was addressed as Haridāsa Gosvāmī, he still did not like to disturb the common sense of the general populace. Haridāsa Ṭhākura was so exalted that he was addressed as *ṭhākura* and *gosāñi,* and these titles are offered to the most advanced Vaiṣṇavas. The spiritual master is generally called *gosāñi,* and *ṭhākura* is used to address the *paramahaṁsas,* those in the topmost rank of spirituality. Nonetheless, Haridāsa Ṭhākura did not want to go near the temple, although he was called there by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu Himself. The Jagannātha temple still accepts only those Hindus who are in the *varṇāśrama* order. Other castes, especially those who are not Hindu, are not allowed to enter the temple. This is a long-standing regulation, and thus Haridāsa Ṭhākura, although certainly competent and qualified to enter the temple, did not want even to go near it. This is called Vaiṣṇava humility.

### Translation

**“Please give that room to Me, for I have a need for it. Indeed, I shall remember the lotus feet of the Lord sitting in that solitary place.”**

### Purport

This statement of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is significant. *Nibhṛte vasiyā tāhāṅ kariba smaraṇa:* “I shall sit down there in that solitary place and remember the lotus feet of the Lord.” Neophyte students are not to imitate sitting in a solitary place and remembering the lotus feet of the Lord by chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra.* We should always remember that it was Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu Himself who wanted such a place, either for Himself or Haridāsa Ṭhākura. No one can suddenly attain the level of Haridāsa Ṭhākura and sit down in a solitary place to chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra* and remember the lotus feet of the Lord. Only an exalted person like Haridāsa Ṭhākura or Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, who is personally exhibiting the proper behavior for an *ācārya,* can engage in such a practice.

At the present moment we see that some of the members of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness are tending to leave their preaching activities in order to sit in a solitary place. This is not a very good sign. It is a fact that Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura has condemned this process for neophytes. He has even stated in a song, *pratiṣṭhāra tare, nirjanera ghare, tava hari-nāma kevala kaitava:* “Sitting in a solitary place intending to chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra* is considered a cheating process.” This practice is not possible for neophytes at all. The neophyte devotee must act and work very laboriously under the direction of the spiritual master, and he must thus preach the cult of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Only after maturing in devotion can he sit down in a solitary place to chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra* as Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu Himself did. Although Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, to teach us a lesson He traveled all over India continuously for six years and only then retired at Jagannātha Purī. Even at Jagannātha Purī the Lord chanted the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra* in great meetings at the Jagannātha temple. The point is that one should not try to imitate Haridāsa Ṭhākura at the beginning of one’s transcendental life. One must first become very mature in devotion and thus receive the approval of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Only at such a time may one actually sit down peacefully in a solitary place to chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra* and remember the lotus feet of the Lord. The senses are very strong, and if a neophyte devotee imitates Haridāsa Ṭhākura, his enemies (*kāma, krodha, lobha, moha, mada* and *mātsarya*) will disturb and fatigue him. Instead of chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra,* the neophyte will simply sleep soundly. Preaching work is meant for advanced devotees, and when an advanced devotee is further elevated on the devotional scale, he may retire to chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra* in a solitary place. However, if one simply imitates advanced spiritual life, he will fall down, just like the *sahajiyās* in Vṛndāvana.

### Translation

**Then both the Lord and His servant began to cry in ecstatic love. Indeed, the Lord was transformed by the qualities of His servant, and the servant was transformed by the qualities of his master.**

### Purport

The Māyāvādī philosophers say that the living entity and the Supreme Lord are nondifferent, and therefore they equate the transformation of the living entity with the transformation of the Lord. In other words, Māyāvādīs say that if the living entity is pleased, the Lord is also pleased, and if the living entity is displeased, the Lord is also displeased. By juggling words in this way, Māyāvādīs try to prove that there is no difference between the living entity and the Lord. This, however, is not a fact. In this verse Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī explains: *prabhu-guṇe bhṛtya vikala, prabhu bhṛtya-guṇe.* The Lord and the living entity are not equal, for the Lord is always the master, and the living entity is always the servant. Transformation takes place due to transcendental qualities, and it is thus said that the servant of the Lord is the heart of the Lord, and the Lord is the heart of the servant. This is also explained by Lord Kṛṣṇa in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (4.11):

*ye yathā māṁ prapadyante* *tāṁs tathaiva bhajāmy aham  
mama vartmānuvartante* *manuṣyāḥ pārtha sarvaśaḥ*

“As all surrender unto Me, I reward them accordingly. Everyone follows My path in all respects, O son of Pṛthā.”

The Lord is always eager to congratulate the servant because of the servant’s transcendental qualities. The servant pleasingly renders service unto the Lord, and the Lord also very pleasingly reciprocates, rendering even more service unto the servant.

### Translation

**The Lord said, “I wish to touch you just to be purified, for your purified activities do not exist in Me.”**

### Purport

This is an example of the reciprocation of feelings between master and servant. The servant thinks that he is most impure and that the master should not touch him, and the master thinks that because He has become impure by associating with so many impure living entities, He should touch a pure devotee like Haridāsa Ṭhākura just to purify Himself. Actually both the servant and the master are already purified because neither of them is in touch with the impurities of material existence. They are already equal in quality because both of them are the purest. There is a difference in quantity, however, because the master is unlimited and the servant is limited. Consequently the servant always remains subordinate to the master, and this relationship is eternal and undisturbed. As soon as the servant feels like becoming the master, he falls into *māyā.* Thus it is by misuse of free will that one falls under the influence of *māyā.*

The Māyāvādī philosophers try to explain the equality of master and servant in terms of quantity, but they fail to explain why, if the master and servant are equal, the servant falls victim to *māyā.* They try to explain that when the servant, the living entity, is out of the clutches of *māyā,* he immediately becomes the so-called master again. Such an explanation is never satisfactory. Being unlimited, the master cannot become a victim of *māyā,* for in such a case His unlimitedness would be crippled or limited. Thus the Māyāvāda explanation is not correct. The fact is that the master is always master and unlimited, and the servant, being limited, is sometimes curtailed by the influence of *māyā. Māyā* is also the master’s energy and is also unlimited; therefore the limited servant or limited living entity is forced to remain under the master or the master’s potency, *māyā.* Being freed from *māyā’s* influence, one can again become a pure servant and equal qualitatively to the Lord. The relationship between master and servant continues due to their being unlimited and limited respectively.

### Translation

**Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu then recited the following verse: “ ‘My dear Lord, one who always keeps Your holy name on his tongue becomes greater than an initiated brāhmaṇa. Although he may be born in a family of dog-eaters and therefore by material calculation may be the lowest among men, he is still glorious. This is the wonderful effect of chanting the holy name of the Lord. It is therefore concluded that one who chants the holy name of the Lord should be understood to have performed all kinds of austerities and great sacrifices mentioned in the Vedas. He has already taken his bath in all the holy places of pilgrimage. He has studied all the Vedas, and he is actually an Āryan.’ ”**

### Purport

The word Āryan means advanced. Unless one is spiritually advanced, he cannot be called an Āryan, and this is the difference between Āryan and non-Āryan. Non-Āryans are those who are not spiritually advanced. By following the Vedic culture, by performing great sacrifices and by becoming a strict follower of the Vedic instructions, one may become a *brāhmaṇa,* a *sannyāsī* or an Āryan. It is not possible to become a *brāhmaṇa, sannyāsī* or Āryan without being properly qualified. *Bhāgavata-dharma* never allows one to become a cheap *brāhmaṇa, sannyāsī* or Āryan. The qualities or qualifications described herein are quoted from *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (3.33.7) and were spoken by Devahūti, the mother of Kapiladeva, when she understood the influence of devotional service (*bhakti-yoga*)*.* In this way Devahūti praised the devotee, pointing out his greatness in all respects.

### Translation

**“Remain here peacefully and look at the cakra on the top of the temple and offer obeisances. As far as your prasādam is concerned, I shall arrange to have that sent here.”**

### Purport

Since he was born in a Muslim family, Śrīla Haridāsa Ṭhākura could not enter the temple of Jagannātha due to temple restrictions. Nonetheless, he was recognized by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu as Nāmācārya Haridāsa Ṭhākura. Haridāsa Ṭhākura, however, considered himself unfit to enter the Jagannātha temple. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu could have personally taken Haridāsa Ṭhākura into the Jagannātha temple if He wished, but the Lord did not like to disturb a popular custom. Consequently the Lord asked His servant simply to look at the Viṣṇu wheel on top of the temple and offer obeisances (*namaskāra*)*.* This means that if one is not allowed to enter the temple, or if he thinks himself unfit to enter the temple, he can look at the wheel from outside the temple, and that is as good as seeing the Deity within.

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu promised to come daily to see Śrīla Haridāsa Ṭhākura, and this indicates that Śrīla Haridāsa Ṭhākura was so advanced in spiritual life that, although considered unfit to enter the temple, he was being personally visited by the Lord every day. Nor was there any need for his going outside his residence to collect food. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu assured Haridāsa Ṭhākura that the remnants of His food would be sent there. As the Lord states in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (9.22), *yoga-kṣemaṁ vahāmy aham:* “I arrange all life’s necessities for My devotees.”

A reference is made here for those who are very anxious to imitate the behavior of Ṭhākura Haridāsa in an unnatural way. One must receive the order of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu or His representative before adopting such a way of life. The duty of a pure devotee or a servant of the Lord is to carry out the order of the Lord. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu asked Nityānanda Prabhu to go to Bengal and preach, and He asked the Gosvāmīs, Rūpa and Sanātana, to go to Vṛndāvana and excavate the lost places of pilgrimage. In this case the Lord asked Haridāsa Ṭhākura to remain there at Jagannātha Purī and constantly chant the holy names of the Lord. Thus Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu gave different persons different orders, and consequently one should not try to imitate the behavior of Haridāsa Ṭhākura without being ordered by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu or His representative. Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura condemns such imitations in this way:

*duṣṭa mana! tumi kisera vaiṣṇava?  
pratiṣṭhāra tare,* *nirjanera ghare,  
tava hari-nāma kevala kaitava*

“My dear mind, you are trying to imitate Haridāsa Ṭhākura and chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra* in a secluded place, but you are not worth being called a Vaiṣṇava because what you want is cheap popularity and not the actual qualifications of Haridāsa Ṭhākura. If you try to imitate him you will fall down, for your neophyte position will cause you to think of women and money. Thus you will fall into the clutches of *māyā,* and your so-called chanting in a secluded place will bring about your downfall.”

### Translation

**They ate all kinds of cakes and sweet rice, filling themselves up to their throats, and at intervals they vibrated the holy name of the Lord in great jubilation.**

### Purport

It is the practice of Vaiṣṇavas while taking *prasādam* to chant the holy name of Lord Hari at intervals and also sing various songs, such as *śarīra avidyā-jāla.* Those who are honoring *prasādam,* accepting the remnants of food offered to the Deity, must always remember that *prasādam* is not ordinary food. *Prasādam* is transcendental. We are therefore reminded:

*mahā-prasāde govinde* *nāma-brahmaṇi vaiṣṇave  
sv-alpa-puṇya-vatāṁ rājan* *viśvāso naiva jāyate*

Those who are not pious cannot understand the value of *mahā- prasādam* or the holy name of the Lord. Both *prasādam* and the Lord’s name are on the Brahman platform, or spiritual platform. One should never consider *prasādam* to be like ordinary hotel cooking. Nor should one touch any kind of food not offered to the Deity. Every Vaiṣṇava strictly follows this principle and does not accept any food that is not *prasādam.* One should take *prasādam* with great faith and should chant the holy name of the Lord and worship the Deity in the temple, always remembering that the Deity, *mahā-prasādam* and the holy name do not belong to the mundane platform. By worshiping the Deity, eating *prasādam* and chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra,* one can always remain on the spiritual platform (*brahma-bhūyāya kalpate*)*.*
