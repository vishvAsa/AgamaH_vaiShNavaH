CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE

Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura gives the following summary of the twenty-first chapter. In this chapter Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu fully describes Kṛṣṇaloka, the spiritual sky, the Causal Ocean and the material world, which consists of innumerable universes. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu then describes Lord Brahmā’s interview with Kṛṣṇa at Dvārakā and the Lord’s curbing the pride of Brahmā. There is also a description of one of Kṛṣṇa’s pastimes with Brahmā. In this chapter the author of the *Caitanya-caritāmṛta* has presented some nice poems about the pastimes of Kṛṣṇa and Kṛṣṇa’s superexcellent beauty. Throughout the rest of the chapter, our intimate relationship (*sambandha*) with Kṛṣṇa is described.

Nor can You Yourself ascertain the limit of Your qualities. Like atoms in the sky, there are multi-universes with seven coverings, and these are rotating in due course of time. All the experts in Vedic understanding are searching for You by eliminating the material elements. In this way, searching and searching, they come to the conclusion that everything is complete in You. Thus You are the resort of everything. This is the conclusion of all Vedic experts.’**

### Purport

This verse from *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (10.87.41), which was spoken by the personified *Vedas,* is confirmed by Lord Kṛṣṇa in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (7.19):

*bahūnāṁ janmanām ante* *jñānavān māṁ prapadyate  
vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti* *sa mahātmā su-durlabhaḥ*

“After many births and deaths, he who is actually in knowledge surrenders unto Me, knowing Me to be the cause of all causes and all that is. Such a great soul is very rare.” Even after searching for the Absolute Truth throughout the universe, learned scholars and Vedic experts cannot reach the ultimate goal. In this way they come to Kṛṣṇa.

When there is a discussion about the Absolute Truth, there are always various pros and cons. The purpose of such arguments is to come to the right conclusion. Such an argument is generally known as *neti neti* (“not this, not that”). Until one comes to the right conclusion, the process of thinking “This is not the Absolute Truth, that is not the Absolute Truth” will continue. When we come to the right conclusion, we accept the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, as the ultimate truth.

### Translation

### Purport

When Lord Kṛṣṇa was present in the earthly Vṛndāvana, Lord Brahmā, taking Him to be an ordinary cowherd boy, wanted to test His potency. Therefore Lord Brahmā stole all the calves and cowherd boys from Kṛṣṇa and hid them by his illusory energy. When Kṛṣṇa saw that Brahmā had stolen His calves and cowherd boys, He immediately created many material and spiritual planets in Lord Brahmā’s presence. Within a moment, cowherd boys, calves and unlimited Vaikuṇṭhas — all expansions of the Lord’s spiritual energy — were manifested. As stated in the *Brahma-saṁhitā, ānanda-cinmaya-rasa-pratibhāvitābhiḥ.* Not only did Kṛṣṇa create all the paraphernalia of His spiritual energy, but He also created unlimited material universes with unlimited Brahmās. All these pastimes, which are described in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,* will cleanse one’s consciousness. In this way one can actually understand the Absolute Truth. The spiritual planets in the spiritual sky are called Vaikuṇṭhas, and each of them has a predominating Deity (Nārāyaṇa) with a specific name. Similarly, in the material sky there are innumerable universes, and each is dominated by a specific deity, a Brahmā. Kṛṣṇa simultaneously created all these Vaikuṇṭha planets and universes within a moment after Brahmā’s return.

The word *avadhūta* means “rambling, agitating, moving, absorbed, defeated.” In some readings of *Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta,* it is said: *yāhāra śravaṇe citta-mala haya dhūta.* Instead of the word *avadhūta,* the words *haya dhūta,* meaning that the heart or consciousness is cleansed, are used. When the consciousness is cleansed, one can understand what and who Kṛṣṇa is. This is confirmed by Kṛṣṇa in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (7.28):

*yeṣāṁ tv anta-gataṁ pāpaṁ* *janānāṁ puṇya-karmaṇām  
te dvandva-moha-nirmuktā* *bhajante māṁ dṛḍha-vratāḥ*

“Persons who have acted piously in previous lives and in this life and whose sinful actions are completely eradicated are freed from the dualities of delusion, and they engage themselves in My service with determination.” Unless one is freed from the reactions of sinful activities, one cannot understand Kṛṣṇa or engage in His transcendental loving service.

### Translation

**“Each of the cowherd boys was tending calves to the extent of a koṭi, arbuda, śaṅkha and padma. That is the way of counting.**

### Purport

According to Vedic mathematical calculations, the following enumeration system is used: units, tens (*daśa*)*,* hundreds (*śata*)*,* thousands (*sahasra*)*,* ten thousands (*ayuta*) and hundred thousands (*lakṣa*)*.* Ten times *lakṣa* is *niyuta.* Ten times *niyuta* is *koṭi.* Ten times *koṭi* is *arbuda.* Ten times *arbuda* is *vṛnda.* Ten times *vṛnda* is *kharva.* Ten times *kharva* is *nikharva.* Ten times *nikharva* is *śaṅkha.* Ten times *śaṅkha* is *padma,* and ten times *padma* is *sāgara.* Ten times *sāgara* is *antya,* and ten times *antya* is *madhya,* and ten times *madhya* is *parārdha.* Each item is ten times greater than the previous one. Thus all the cowherd boys, who were companions of Kṛṣṇa, had many calves to take care of.

### Translation

### Purport

Because he wants to enjoy the material energy, the conditioned soul is allowed to reside in Devī-dhāma, the external energy, where goddess Durgā carries out the orders of the Supreme Lord as His maidservant. The material energy is called *jagal-lakṣmī* because she protects the bewildered conditioned souls. Goddess Durgā is therefore known as the material mother, and Lord Śiva, her husband, is known as the material father. Goddess Durgā is so named because this material world is like a big fort where the conditioned soul is placed under her care. For material facilities, the conditioned soul tries to please goddess Durgā, and mother Durgā supplies all kinds of material facilities. Because of this, the conditioned souls are allured and do not wish to leave the external energy. Consequently they are continuously making plans to live here peacefully and happily. Such is the material world.

### Translation

**“Kṛṣṇa is the supreme proprietor of all dhāmas, including Goloka-dhāma, Vaikuṇṭha-dhāma and Devī-dhāma. The paravyoma and Goloka-dhāma are beyond Devī-dhāma, this material world.**

### Purport

When a living entity is liberated from Devī-dhāma but does not know of the opulence of Hari-dhāma, he is placed in Maheśa-dhāma, which is between the other two *dhāmas.* The liberated soul does not get an opportunity to serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead there; therefore although this Maheśa-dhāma is Lord Śiva’s *dhāma* and above Devī-dhāma, it is not the spiritual world. The spiritual world begins with Hari-dhāma, or Vaikuṇṭhaloka.

Hari-dhāma (*paravyoma*) and Goloka Vṛndāvana are beyond the material cosmic manifestation. They are celebrated as three fourths of the Lord’s energy. The material world, conducted by the Supreme Lord’s external energy, is called Devī-dhāma and is a manifestation of one fourth of His energy.

### Translation

**“Actually it is very difficult to ascertain the number of universes. Every universe has its separate Lord Brahmā and Lord Śiva, who are known as permanent governors. Therefore there is also no counting them.**

### Purport

Lord Brahmā and Lord Śiva are called *cira-loka-pāla,* permanent governors. This means that they govern the affairs of the universe from the beginning of the creation to the end. In the next creation, the same living entities may not be present, but because Brahmā and Śiva are existing from the beginning to the end, they are called *cira-loka-pāla,* permanent governors. *Loka-pāla* means “predominating deities.” There are eight predominating deities of the prominent heavenly planets, and they are Indra, Agni, Yama, Varuṇa, Nirṛti, Vāyu, Kuvera and Śiva.

### Translation

**“When Kṛṣṇa was so informed, He immediately asked the doorman, ‘Which Brahmā? What is his name?’ The doorman therefore returned and questioned Lord Brahmā.**

### Purport

From this verse we can understand that Brahmā is the name of the post and that the person occupying the post has a particular name also. From the *Bhagavad-gītā: imaṁ vivasvate yogam.* Vivasvān is the name of the present predominating deity of the sun. He is generally called Sūrya, the sun-god, but he also has his own particular name. The governor of the state is generally called *rāja-pāla,* but he also has his own individual name. Since there are hundreds and thousands of Brahmās with different names, Kṛṣṇa wanted to know which of them had come to see Him.

### Translation

**“There is a very deep meaning in the word ‘try-adhīśvara,’ which indicates that Kṛṣṇa possesses three different lokas, or natures.**

### Purport

The word *try-adhīśvara* means “proprietor of the three worlds.” There are three worlds, and Kṛṣṇa is the supreme proprietor of them all. This is explained by Lord Kṛṣṇa in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (5.29):

*bhoktāraṁ yajña-tapasāṁ* *sarva-loka-maheśvaram  
suhṛdaṁ sarva-bhūtānāṁ* *jñātvā māṁ śāntim ṛcchati*

“A person in full consciousness of Me, knowing Me to be the ultimate beneficiary of all sacrifices and austerities, the Supreme Lord of all planets and demigods, and the benefactor and well-wisher of all living entities, attains peace from the pangs of material miseries.”

The word *sarva-loka* means “all three worlds,” and the word *maheśvara* means “the supreme proprietor.” Kṛṣṇa is the proprietor of both the material and the spiritual world. The spiritual world is divided into two portions — Goloka Vṛndāvana and the Vaikuṇṭhas. The material world is a combination of universes unlimited in number.

### Purport

Kṛṣṇa has many pastimes, of which His pastimes in Goloka Vṛndāvana (the *gokula-līlā*) are supreme. He also has pastimes in the Vaikuṇṭhas, the spiritual world, as Vāsudeva, Saṅkarṣaṇa, Pradyumna and Aniruddha. In His pastimes in the material sky, He lies down in the Causal Ocean as Kāraṇārṇavaśāyī, the *puruṣa-avatāra.* His incarnations as a fish, tortoise and so on are called His causal incarnations. He incarnates in the modes of nature as Lord Brahmā, Lord Śiva and Lord Viṣṇu. He also incarnates as empowered living entities like Pṛthu and Vyāsa. The Supersoul is His localized incarnation, and His all-pervasive aspect is the impersonal Brahman.

When we consider impartially all the unlimited pastimes of the Lord, we find that His pastimes as a human being on this planet — wherein He sports as a cowherd boy with a flute in His hands and appears youthful and fresh like a ballet dancer — are pastimes and features that are never subjected to material laws and inebrieties. The wonderful beauty of Kṛṣṇa is presented in the supreme planet, Gokula (Goloka Vṛndāvana). Inferior to that is His representation in the spiritual sky, and inferior to that is His representation in the external energy (Devī-dhāma). A mere drop of Kṛṣṇa’s sweetness can drown these three worlds — Goloka Vṛndāvana, Hari-dhāma (Vaikuṇṭhaloka) and Devī-dhāma (the material world). Everywhere, Kṛṣṇa’s beauty merges everyone in the ecstasy of transcendental bliss. Actually the activities of *yogamāyā* are absent in the spiritual sky and the Vaikuṇṭha planets. She simply works in the supreme planet, Goloka Vṛndāvana, and she works to manifest the activities of Kṛṣṇa when He descends to the material universe to please His innumerable devotees within the material world. Thus a replica of the Goloka Vṛndāvana planet and the pastimes there is manifested on this planet on a specific tract of land — Bhauma Vṛndāvana, the Vṛndāvana-dhāma on this planet.

Above all these beautiful features, Kṛṣṇa’s eyes dance and move obliquely, acting like arrows to pierce the minds of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī and the gopīs.

Kṛṣṇa is the owner of these five arrows, and with His Cupid-like beauty He conquers the minds of the gopīs, though they are very proud of their superexcellent beauty.

### Translation

**“When the onlooker of Kṛṣṇa’s face becomes dissatisfied in this way, he thinks, ‘Why didn’t the creator give me thousands and millions of eyes? Why has he given me only two? Even these two eyes are disturbed by blinking, which keeps me from continuously seeing Kṛṣṇa’s face.’ Thus one accuses the creator of being dry and tasteless due to engaging in severe austerities. ‘The creator is only a dry manufacturer. He does not know how to create and set things in their proper places.**

If the creator will accept this advice, then I would say that he is competent in his work.’**

Moving His hands in ecstasy, He recited a verse.**

### Purport

When there is a combination of *kapha, pitta* and *vāyu,* the three bodily elements, there occurs *sannipāti,* or a convulsive disease. Lord Caitanya said, “This disease of Mine is caused by the personal features of Lord Kṛṣṇa. The three elements are the beauty of Kṛṣṇa’s body, the beauty of His face, and the beauty of His smile. Stricken by these three beauties, My mind goes into convulsions. It wishes to drink the ocean of Kṛṣṇa’s beauty, but because I am undergoing convulsions, My physician, who is Śrī Kṛṣṇa Himself, does not even allow Me to take a drop of water from that ocean.” Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was ecstatic in this way because He was presenting Himself in the mood of the *gopīs.* The *gopīs* wanted to drink the ocean of sweetness arising from the bodily features of Kṛṣṇa, but Kṛṣṇa did not allow them to come near. Consequently their desire to meet Kṛṣṇa increased, and being unable to drink the ambrosia of Kṛṣṇa’s bodily features, they became very unhappy.

### Purport

The vibration of Kṛṣṇa’s flute is always prominent in the ears of the *gopīs.* Naturally they cannot hear anything else. Constant remembrance of the holy sound of Kṛṣṇa’s flute keeps them enlightened and enlivened, and they do not allow any other sound to enter their ears. Since their attention is fixed on Kṛṣṇa’s flute, they cannot divert their minds to any other subject. In other words, a devotee who has heard the sound of Kṛṣṇa’s flute forgets to talk or hear of any other subject. This vibration of Kṛṣṇa’s flute is represented by the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra.* A serious devotee of the Lord who chants and hears this transcendental vibration becomes so accustomed to it that he cannot divert his attention to any subject matter not related to Kṛṣṇa’s blissful characteristics and paraphernalia.

Lord Kṛṣṇa is very merciful to you because by bewildering My mind He has revealed His personal opulence and sweetness. He has caused you to hear all these things from Me for your understanding.**

### Purport

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu admitted that He was speaking like a madman, which He should not have done for the understanding of those who are externally situated. Statements about Kṛṣṇa’s body, His characteristics and His flute would appear like a madman’s statements to a mundane person. It was actually a fact that Kṛṣṇa wanted to reveal Himself to Sanātana Gosvāmī due to His specific mercy upon him. Somehow or other, Kṛṣṇa explained Himself and His flute to Sanātana Gosvāmī through the mouth of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, who appeared as though mad. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu admitted that He wanted to tell Sanātana Gosvāmī something else, but somehow or other, in transcendental ecstasy, He spoke of a different subject matter.
