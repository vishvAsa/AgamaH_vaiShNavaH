CHAPTER TWENTY

The following summary of this chapter is given by Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura in his *Amṛta-pravāha-bhāṣya.* When Śrīla Sanātana Gosvāmī was imprisoned by Nawab Hussain Shah, he received news from Rūpa Gosvāmī that Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu had gone to Mathurā. Sanātana Gosvāmī thereafter satisfied the superintendent of the jail by sweet solicitations and bribery. After giving the jailer seven thousand gold coins, Sanātana Gosvāmī was released. He then crossed the Ganges and fled. One of his servants, Īśāna, followed him, carrying eight gold coins. Sanātana Gosvāmī and his servant then spent the night in a small hotel on the way to Benares. The hotel owner knew that Sanātana Gosvāmī and his servant had eight gold coins, and he decided to kill them and take the money. Making plans in this way, the hotel owner received them as honorable guests. Sanātana Gosvāmī, however, asked his servant how much money he had, and taking seven of the gold coins, Sanātana offered them to the hotel owner. Thus the owner helped them cross the hilly tract and proceed toward Vārāṇasī. On the way, Sanātana Gosvāmī met his brother-in-law, Śrīkānta, at Hājipura, and Śrīkānta helped him after he had heard about all Sanātana’s troubles. Thus Sanātana Gosvāmī finally arrived at Vārāṇasī and stood before the door of Candraśekhara. Caitanya Mahāprabhu called him in and ordered him to change his dress so that he would look like a gentleman. For his garment, he used an old cloth of Tapana Miśra’s. Later, he exchanged his valuable blanket for a torn quilt. At this time Caitanya Mahāprabhu was very pleased with him, and thus Śrī Sanātana Gosvāmī received knowledge of the Absolute Truth from the Lord Himself.

First they discussed the constitutional position of the living entities, and Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu explained to Sanātana Gosvāmī how the living entity is one of Lord Kṛṣṇa’s energies. After this, the Lord explained the way of devotional service. While discussing the Absolute Truth, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the Lord analyzed Brahman, Paramātmā and Bhagavān, as well as the expansions of the Lord called *svayaṁ-rūpa, tad-ekātma* and *āveśa,* which are divided into various branches known as *vaibhava* and *prābhava.* Thus the Lord described the many forms of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He also described the incarnations of God within the material world, incarnations such as the *puruṣa-avatāras, manvantara-avatāras, guṇa-avatāras* and *śaktyāveśa-avatāras.* The Lord also discussed the divisions of Kṛṣṇa’s different ages, such as *bālya* and *paugaṇḍa,* and the different pastimes of the different ages. He explained how Kṛṣṇa attained His permanent form when He reached youth. In this way Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu explained and described everything to Sanātana Gosvāmī.

saṁsāra ha-ite tāre mukta karena gosāñā*

### Synonyms

### Translation

**“If one releases a conditioned soul or imprisoned person according to religious principles, he himself is also released from material bondage by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.”**

### Purport

It appears from this statement that Sanātana Gosvāmī, who was formerly a minister of the Nawab, was trying to cheat the Muslim superintendent. A jail superintendent had only an ordinary education, or practically no education, and he was certainly not supposed to be very advanced in spiritual knowledge. But just to satisfy him, Sanātana Gosvāmī praised him as a very learned scholar of the scriptures. The jailkeeper could not deny that he was a learned scholar, because when one is elevated to an exalted position, one thinks oneself fit for that position. Sanātana Gosvāmī was correctly explaining the effects of spiritual activity, and the jailkeeper connected his statement with his release from jail.

There are innumerable conditioned souls rotting in the material world, imprisoned by *māyā* under the spell of sense gratification. The living entity is so entranced by the spell of *māyā* that in conditioned life even a pig feels satisfied. There are two kinds of covering powers exhibited by *māyā.* One is called *prakṣepātmikā,* and the other is called *āvaraṇātmikā.* When one is determined to get out of material bondage, the *prakṣepātmikā-śakti,* the spell of diversion, impels one to remain in conditioned life fully satisfied by sense gratification. Due to the other power (*āvaraṇātmikā*), a conditioned soul feels satisfied even if he is rotting in the body of a pig or a worm in stool. To release a conditioned soul from material bondage is very difficult because the spell of *māyā* is so strong. Even when the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself descends to deliver conditioned souls, asking them to surrender unto Him, the conditioned souls do not agree to the Lord’s proposal. Therefore Śrī Sanātana Gosvāmī said, “Somehow or other, if one helps another gain release from the bondage of *māyā,* he is certainly recognized immediately by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.” As Lord Kṛṣṇa states in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (18.69):

*na ca tasmān manuṣyeṣu* *kaścin me priya-kṛttamaḥ  
bhavitā na ca me tasmād* *anyaḥ priyataro bhuvi*

The greatest service one can render to the Lord is to try to infuse devotional service into the heart of the conditioned soul so that the conditioned soul may be released from conditioned life. Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura has said that a Vaiṣṇava is recognized by his preaching work — that is, by convincing the conditioned soul about his eternal position, which is explained here as *nija-dharma.* It is the living entity’s eternal position to serve the Lord; therefore to help one get release from material bondage is to awaken one to the dormant understanding that he is the eternal servant of Kṛṣṇa. *Jīvera ‘svarūpa’ haya — kṛṣṇera ‘nitya-dāsa’.* This will be further explained by the Lord Himself to Sanātana Gosvāmī.

### Translation

**“ ‘Saints of your caliber are themselves places of pilgrimage. Because of their purity, they are constant companions of the Lord, and therefore they can purify even the places of pilgrimage.’**

### Purport

This verse was spoken by Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira to Vidura in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (1.13.10). Vidura was returning home after visiting sacred places of pilgrimage, and Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira was receiving his saintly uncle. In essence, Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira was saying, “My dear Lord Vidura, you yourself are a holy place because you are an advanced devotee. People like you always carry Lord Viṣṇu in their hearts. You can revitalize all holy places after they have been polluted by the pilgrimages of sinners.”

A sinful person goes to a holy place of pilgrimage to be purified. In a holy place, there are many saintly people and temples of Lord Viṣṇu; however, the holy place becomes infected with the sins of many visitors. When an advanced devotee goes to a holy place, he counteracts all the sins of the pilgrims. Therefore Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira addressed Vidura in this way.

Since an advanced devotee carries Lord Viṣṇu within his heart, he is a moving temple and a moving Viṣṇu. An advanced devotee does not need to go to holy places, for wherever he stays is a holy place. In this connection, Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura states, *tīrtha-yātrā pariśrama, kevala manera bhrama:* visiting holy places is simply another type of bewilderment. Since an advanced devotee does not need to go to a holy place, why does he go? The answer is that he goes simply to purify the place.

However, even though a person is born in a family of dog-eaters, he is very dear to Me if he is a pure devotee who has no motive to enjoy fruitive activity or mental speculation. Indeed, all respects should be given to him, and whatever he offers should be accepted. Such devotees are as worshipable as I am.’**

### Translation

**“ ‘One may be born in a brāhmaṇa family and have all twelve brahminical qualities, but if he is not devoted to the lotus feet of Lord Kṛṣṇa, who has a navel shaped like a lotus, he is not as good as a caṇḍāla who has dedicated his mind, words, activities, wealth and life to the service of the Lord. Simply to take birth in a brāhmaṇa family or to have brahminical qualities is not sufficient. One must become a pure devotee of the Lord. If a śva-paca or caṇḍāla is a devotee, he delivers not only himself but his whole family, whereas a brāhmaṇa who is not a devotee but simply has brahminical qualifications cannot even purify himself, what to speak of his family.’ ”**

### Purport

This verse is spoken by Prahlāda Mahārāja in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (7.9.10). A *brāhmaṇa* is supposed to be qualified with twelve qualities. As stated in the *Mahābhārata:*

*dharmaś ca satyaṁ ca damas tapaś ca *
 *amātsaryaṁ hrīs titikṣānasūyā  
yajñaś ca dānaṁ ca dhṛtiḥ śrutaṁ ca *
 *vratāni vai dvādaśa brāhmaṇasya*

“A *brāhmaṇa* must be perfectly religious. He must be truthful, and he must be able to control his senses. He must execute severe austerities, and he must be detached, humble and tolerant. He must not envy anyone, and he must be expert in performing sacrifices and giving whatever he has in charity. He must be fixed in devotional service and expert in the knowledge of the *Vedas.* These are the twelve qualifications for a *brāhmaṇa*.”

The *Bhagavad-gītā* (18.42) describes the brahminical qualities in this way:

*śamo damas tapaḥ śaucaṁ* *kṣāntir ārjavam eva ca  
jñānaṁ vijñānam āstikyaṁ* *brahma-karma svabhāva-jam*

“Peacefulness, self-control, austerity, purity, tolerance, honesty, knowledge, wisdom and religiousness — these are the natural qualities by which the *brāhmaṇas* work.”

In the *Muktāphala-ṭīkā,* it is said:

*śamo damas tapaḥ śaucaṁ* *kṣānty-ārjava-viraktayaḥ  
jñāna-vijñāna-santoṣāḥ* *satyāstikye dvi-ṣaḍ guṇāḥ*

“Mental equilibrium, sense control, austerity, cleanliness, tolerance, simplicity, detachment, theoretical and practical knowledge, satisfaction, truthfulness and firm faith in the *Vedas* are the twelve qualities of a *brāhmaṇa.*”

### Translation

**“My dear Sanātana, Kṛṣṇa has saved you from Mahāraurava, life’s deepest hell. He is an ocean of mercy, and His activities are very grave.”**

### Purport

As stated in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (18.61), *īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ hṛd-deśe ’rjuna tiṣṭhati.* Staying within everyone’s heart, Lord Kṛṣṇa works very gravely. No one can understand how He is working, but as soon as the Lord understands the sincere activity of a person in devotional service, He helps him in such a way that the devotee cannot understand how things are happening. If the devotee is determined to serve the Lord, the Lord is always prepared to help him (*dadāmi buddhi-yogaṁ taṁ yena mām upayānti te*)*.* Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is telling Sanātana Gosvāmī how merciful the Lord is. Sanātana Gosvāmī was a minister in the service of Nawab Hussain Shah. He was always mixing with materially inclined people, particularly with Muslims, meat-eaters. Although he was in intimate touch with them, by Kṛṣṇa’s mercy he came to find such association distasteful. Therefore he left them. As stated by Śrīnivāsa Ācārya, *tyaktvā tūrṇam aśeṣa-maṇḍala-pati-śreṇīṁ sadā tuccha-vat.* Kṛṣṇa enlightened Sanātana Gosvāmī in such a way that he was able to give up his exalted post as minister. Thinking his material position insignificant, Sanātana was prepared to become a mendicant. Appreciating the activities of Sanātana Gosvāmī, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu praised his action and thanked Kṛṣṇa for His mercy upon him.

### Translation

**Candraśekhara then made Sanātana Gosvāmī look like a gentleman. He took him to bathe in the Ganges, and afterwards he brought him a new set of clothes.**

### Purport

The words *bhadra karāñā* are significant in this verse. Due to his long hair, mustache and beard, Sanātana Gosvāmī looked like a *daraveśa,* or hippie. Since Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu did not like Sanātana Gosvāmī’s hippie features, he immediately asked Candraśekhara to get him shaved clean. If anyone with long hair or a beard wants to join this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement and live with us, he must similarly shave himself clean. The followers of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu consider long hair objectionable.

Sanātana Gosvāmī was saved from a hellish condition (Mahāraurava) by the grace of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Mahāraurava is a hell wherein animal killers are placed. In this regard, refer to *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (5.26.10-12).

सनातन कहे, — “आमि माधुकरी करिव ।  
व्राह्मणेर घरे केने एकत्र भिक्षा लव ?” ८१ ॥

### Verse text

*sanātana kahe, — “āmi mādhukarī kariba  
brāhmaṇera ghare kene ekatra bhikṣā laba?”*

### Synonyms

*sanātana* *kahe* — Sanātana replied; *āmi* — I; *mādhukarī* *kariba* — shall practice acceptance of food by *mādhukarī* means; *brāhmaṇera* *ghare* — in the house of a *brāhmaṇa*; *kene* — why; *ekatra* — in one place; *bhikṣā* *laba* — I should accept lunch.

### Translation

**Sanātana replied, “I shall practice the process of mādhukarī. Why should I accept full meals in the house of a brāhmaṇa?”**

### Purport

The word *mādhukarī* comes from the word *madhukara,* which refers to bees collecting honey from flower to flower. A *mādhukarī* is a saintly person or a mendicant who does not accept a full meal at one house but begs from door to door, taking a little food from each householder’s place. In this way he does not overeat or give householders unnecessary trouble. A person in the renounced order may beg but not cook. His begging should not be a burden for the householders. The *mādhukarī* process is strictly to be followed by a *bābājī,* that is, one who has attained the *paramahaṁsa* stage. This practice is still current in Vṛndāvana, and there are many places where alms are offered. Unfortunately, there are many beggars who have come to Vṛndāvana to accept alms but not follow the principles of Sanātana Gosvāmī. People try to imitate him and lead an idle life by practicing *mādhukarī.* It is almost impossible to strictly follow Sanātana Gosvāmī or Rūpa Gosvāmī. It is better to accept food offered to Kṛṣṇa in the temple than to try to imitate Sanātana Gosvāmī and Rūpa Gosvāmī.

*yuktāhāra-vihārasya* *yukta-ceṣṭasya karmasu  
yukta-svapnāvabodhasya* *yogo bhavati duḥkha-hā*

“He who is regulated in his habits of eating, sleeping, recreation and work can mitigate all material pains by practicing the *yoga* system.” (Bg. 6.17)

The ideal *sannyāsī* strictly follows the ways practiced by the Gosvāmīs.

**Sanātana Gosvāmī said, “I was born in a low family, and my associates are all low-class men. I myself am fallen and am the lowest of men. Indeed, I have passed my whole life fallen in the well of sinful materialism.**

### Purport

Actually Śrī Sanātana Gosvāmī belonged to a *brāhmaṇa* family because he belonged to the Sārasvata division of the *brāhmaṇas* and was well cultured and well educated. Somehow or other he accepted a ministership in the Muslim government; therefore he had to associate with meat-eaters, drunkards and gross materialists. Sanātana Gosvāmī considered himself fallen, for in the association of such men, he also fell victim to material enjoyment. Having passed his life in that way, he considered that he had wasted his valuable time. This statement about how one can become fallen in this material world is made by the greatest authority in the Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava-sampradāya. Actually the whole world is presently fallen into material existence. Everyone is a meat-eater, drunkard, woman-hunter, gambler and whatnot. People are enjoying material life by committing the four basic sins. Although they are fallen, if they simply submit themselves at the lotus feet of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, they will be saved from sinful reactions.

The threefold material miseries are miseries arising from the body and the mind, miseries arising from dealings with other living entities, and miseries arising from natural disturbances. Sometimes we suffer bodily when we are attacked by a fever, and sometimes we suffer mentally when a close relative dies. Other living entities also cause us misery. There are living entities born of the human embryo, of eggs, perspiration and vegetation. Miserable conditions brought about by natural catastrophes are controlled by the higher demigods. There may be severe cold or thunderbolts, or a person may be haunted by ghosts. These threefold miseries are always before us, and they entrap us in a dangerous situation. *Padaṁ padaṁ yad vipadām.* There is danger in every step of life.

### Purport

Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura explains these verses as follows: Śrī Sanātana Gosvāmī asked Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, “Who am I?” In answer, the Lord replied, “You are a pure living entity. You are neither the gross material body nor the subtle body composed of mind and intelligence. Actually you are a spirit soul, eternally part and parcel of the Supreme Soul, Kṛṣṇa. Therefore you are His eternal servant. You belong to Kṛṣṇa’s marginal potency. There are two worlds — the spiritual world and the material world — and you are situated between the material and spiritual potencies. You have a relationship with both the material and the spiritual world; therefore you are called the marginal potency. You are related with Kṛṣṇa as one and simultaneously different. Because you are spirit soul, you are one in quality with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but because you are a very minute particle of spirit soul, you are different from the Supreme Soul. Therefore your position is simultaneously one with and different from the Supreme Soul. The examples given are those of the sun itself and the small particles of sunshine and of a blazing fire and the small particles of fire.” Another explanation of these verses can be found in *Ādi-līlā,* chapter two, verse 96.

### Translation

**“Forgetting Kṛṣṇa, the living entity has been attracted by the external feature from time immemorial. Therefore the illusory energy \[māyā\] gives him all kinds of misery in his material existence.**

### Purport

When the living entity forgets his constitutional position as an eternal servant of Kṛṣṇa, he is immediately entrapped by the illusory, external energy. The living entity is originally part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa and is therefore the superior energy of Kṛṣṇa. He is endowed with inconceivable minute energy that works inconceivably within the body. However, the living entity, forgetting his position, is situated in material energy. The living entity is called the marginal energy because by nature he is spiritual but by forgetfulness he is situated in the material energy. Thus he has the power to live either in the material energy or in the spiritual energy, and for this reason he is called marginal energy. Being in the marginal position, he is sometimes attracted by the external, illusory energy, and this is the beginning of his material life. When he enters the material energy, he is subjected to the threefold time measurement — past, present and future. Past, present and future belong only to the material world; they do not exist in the spiritual world. The living entity is eternal, and he existed before the creation of this material world. Unfortunately he has forgotten his relationship with Kṛṣṇa. The living entity’s forgetfulness is described herein as *anādi,* which indicates that it has existed since time immemorial. One should understand that due to his desire to enjoy himself in competition with Kṛṣṇa, the living entity comes into material existence.

**“In the material condition, the living entity is sometimes raised to higher planetary systems and material prosperity and sometimes drowned in a hellish situation. His state is exactly like that of a criminal whom a king punishes by submerging him in water and then raising him again from the water.**

### Purport

In the *Bṛhad-āraṇyaka Upaniṣad* (4.3.16) it is stated, *asaṅgo hy ayaṁ puruṣaḥ:* the living entity is always free from the contamination of the material world. One who is not materially infected and who does not forget Kṛṣṇa as his master is called *nitya-mukta.* In other words, one who is eternally liberated from material contamination is called *nitya-mukta.* From time immemorial the *nitya-mukta* living entity has always been a devotee of Kṛṣṇa, and his only attempt has been to serve Kṛṣṇa. Thus he never forgets his eternal servitorship to Kṛṣṇa. Any living entity who forgets his eternal relationship with Kṛṣṇa is under the sway of the material condition. Bereft of the Lord’s transcendental loving service, he is subjected to the reactions of fruitive activity. When he is elevated to the higher planetary systems due to worldly pious activities, he considers himself well situated, but when he is subjected to punishment, he thinks himself improperly situated. Thus material nature awards and punishes the living entity. When the living entity is materially opulent, material nature is rewarding him. When he is materially embarrassed, material nature is punishing him.

### Translation

**“ ‘When the living entity is attracted by the material energy, which is separate from Kṛṣṇa, he is overpowered by fear. Because he is separated from the Supreme Personality of Godhead by the material energy, his conception of life is reversed. In other words, instead of being the eternal servant of Kṛṣṇa, he becomes Kṛṣṇa’s competitor. This is called viparyayo ’smṛtiḥ. To nullify this mistake, one who is actually learned and advanced worships the Supreme Personality of Godhead as his spiritual master, worshipful Deity and source of life. He thus worships the Lord by the process of unalloyed devotional service.’**

### Purport

This is a quotation from *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (11.2.37). It is an instruction given by Kavi Ṛṣi, one of the nine saintly personalities called the nine Yogendras. When Vasudeva, Kṛṣṇa’s father, asked Devarṣi Nārada in Dvārakā about devotional service, it was mentioned that previously King Nimi, who was the King of Videha, was instructed by the nine Yogendras. When Śrī Nārada Muni discoursed on *bhāgavata-dharma,* devotional service, he indicated how a conditioned soul can be liberated by engaging in the loving transcendental service of the Lord. The Lord is the Supersoul, spiritual master and worshipable Deity of all conditioned souls. Not only is Kṛṣṇa the supreme worshipful Deity for all living entities, but He is also the *guru,* or *caittya-guru,* the Supersoul, who always gives the living entity good counsel. Unfortunately the living entity neglects the Supreme Person’s instructions. He thus identifies with the material energy and is consequently overpowered by a kind of fear resulting from accepting himself as the material body and considering paraphernalia related to the material body to be his property. All types of fruitive results actually come from the spirit soul, but because he has forgotten his real duty, he is embarrassed by many material consequences such as fear and attachment. The only remedy is to revert to the service of the Lord and thus be saved from material nature’s unwanted harassment.

### Translation

**“If the conditioned soul becomes Kṛṣṇa conscious by the mercy of saintly persons who voluntarily preach scriptural injunctions and help him to become Kṛṣṇa conscious, the conditioned soul is liberated from the clutches of māyā, who gives him up.**

### Purport

A conditioned soul is one who has forgotten Kṛṣṇa as his eternal master. Thinking that he is enjoying the material world, the conditioned soul suffers the threefold miseries of material existence. Saintly persons (*sādhus*), Vaiṣṇava devotees of the Lord, preach Kṛṣṇa consciousness on the basis of the Vedic literature. It is only by their mercy that the conditioned soul is awakened to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. When awakened, he is no longer eager to enjoy the materialistic way of life. Instead, he devotes himself to the loving transcendental service of the Lord. When one engages in the Lord’s devotional service, he becomes detached from material enjoyment:

*bhaktiḥ pareśānubhavo viraktir *
 *anyatra caiṣa trika eka-kālaḥ*

(*Bhāg.* 11.2.42)

This is the test by which one can tell whether he is advancing in devotional service. One must be detached from material enjoyment. Such detachment means that *māyā* has actually given the conditioned soul liberation from illusory enjoyment. When one is advanced in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he does not consider himself as good as Kṛṣṇa. Whenever he thinks that he is the enjoyer of material advantages, he is imprisoned in the bodily conception. However, when he is freed from the bodily conception, he can engage in devotional service, which is his actual position of freedom from the clutches of *māyā.* This is all explained in the following verse from the *Bhagavad-gītā* (7.14).

### Translation

**“The conditioned soul cannot revive his Kṛṣṇa consciousness by his own effort. But out of causeless mercy, Lord Kṛṣṇa compiled the Vedic literature and its supplements, the Purāṇas.**

### Purport

A conditioned soul is bewildered by the Lord’s illusory energy (*māyā*)*. Māyā’s* business is to keep the conditioned soul forgetful of his real relationship with Kṛṣṇa. Thus the living entity forgets his real identity as spirit soul, Brahman, and instead of realizing his factual position thinks himself the product of the material energy. According to *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (1.7.5):

*yayā sammohito jīva* *ātmānaṁ tri-guṇātmakam  
paro ’pi manute ’narthaṁ* *tat-kṛtaṁ cābhipadyate*

“Due to this external energy, the living entity, although transcendental to the three modes of material nature, thinks of himself as a material product and thus undergoes the reactions of material miseries.”

This is a description of *māyā’s* action upon the conditioned soul. Thinking himself a product of the material energy, the conditioned soul engages in the service of the material energy in so many ways. He becomes the servant of lust, anger, greed and envy. In this way one totally becomes a servant of the illusory energy. Later, the bewildered soul becomes a servant of mental speculation, but in any case he is simply covered by the illusory energy. Out of His causeless mercy and compassion, Kṛṣṇa has compiled various Vedic literatures in His incarnation as Vyāsadeva. Vyāsadeva is a *śaktyāveśa-avatāra* of Lord Kṛṣṇa. He has very kindly presented these literatures to awaken the conditioned soul to his senses. Unfortunately, at the present moment the conditioned souls are guided by demons who do not care to read the Vedic literatures. Although there is an immense treasure-house of knowledge, people are engaged in reading useless literature that will give them no information on how to get out of the clutches of *māyā.* The purpose of the Vedic literatures is explained in the following verses.

### Translation

**“The forgetful conditioned soul is educated by Kṛṣṇa through the Vedic literatures, the realized spiritual master and the Supersoul. Through these, he can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead as He is, and he can understand that Lord Kṛṣṇa is his eternal master and deliverer from the clutches of māyā. In this way one can acquire real knowledge of his conditioned life and can come to understand how to attain liberation.**

### Purport

Being forgetful of his real position, the conditioned soul may take help from *śāstra, guru* and the Supersoul within his heart. Kṛṣṇa is situated within everyone’s heart as the Supersoul. As stated in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (18.61):

*īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānām* *hṛd-deśe ’rjuna tiṣṭhati  
bhrāmayan sarva-bhūtāni* *yantrārūḍhāni māyayā*

“The Supreme Lord is situated in everyone’s heart, O Arjuna, and is directing the wanderings of all living entities, who are seated as on a machine made of the material energy.”

As the *śaktyāveśa-avatāra* Vyāsadeva, Kṛṣṇa teaches the conditioned soul through the Vedic literatures. Kṛṣṇa externally appears as the spiritual master and trains the conditioned soul to come to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. When his original Kṛṣṇa consciousness is revived, the conditioned soul is delivered from the material clutches. Thus a conditioned soul is always helped by the Supreme Personality of Godhead in three ways — by the scriptures, the spiritual master and the Supersoul within the heart. The Lord is the deliverer of the conditioned soul and is accepted as the Supreme Lord of all living entities. Kṛṣṇa says in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (18.66):

*sarva-dharmān parityajya* *mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja  
ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo* *mokṣayiṣyāmi mā śucaḥ*

“Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. I shall deliver you from all sinful reactions. Do not fear.” This same instruction is found throughout all Vedic literatures. *Sādhu, śāstra* and *guru* act as the representatives of Kṛṣṇa, and the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is also taking place all over the universe. Whoever takes advantage of this opportunity becomes liberated.

अभिधेय़-नाम ‘भक्ति,’ ‘प्रेम’ — प्रय़ोजन ।

### Verse text

*abhidheya-nāma ‘bhakti’, ‘prema’ — prayojana  
puruṣārtha-śiromaṇi prema mahā-dhana*

### Synonyms

*abhidheya* — activities to revive one’s relationship; *nāma* — named; *bhakti* — devotional service; *prema* — love of Godhead; *prayojana* — the ultimate goal of life; *puruṣa*-*artha*-*śiromaṇi* — the topmost interest of the living entity; *prema* — love of Godhead; *mahā*-*dhana* — the greatest wealth.

### Translation

**“Devotional service, or sense activity for the satisfaction of the Lord, is called abhidheya because it can develop one’s original love of Godhead, which is the goal of life. This goal is the living entity’s topmost interest and greatest wealth. Thus one attains the platform of transcendental loving service unto the Lord.**

### Purport

The conditioned soul is bewildered by the external, material energy, which fully engages him in sense gratification in various ways. Due to engagement in material activities, one’s original Kṛṣṇa consciousness is covered. However, as the supreme father of all living entities, Kṛṣṇa wants His sons to return home, back to Godhead; therefore He personally comes to deliver Vedic literatures like the *Bhagavad-gītā.* He engages His confidential servants who serve as spiritual masters and enlighten the conditioned living entities. Being present in everyone’s heart, the Lord gives the living entities the conscience whereby they can accept the *Vedas* and the spiritual master. In this way the living entity can understand his constitutional position and his relationship with the Supreme Lord. As personally enunciated by the Lord Himself in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (15.15), *vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyaḥ:* through the study of Vedānta, one may become fully aware of his relationship with the Supreme Lord and act accordingly. In this way one may ultimately attain the platform of loving service to the Lord. It is in the living entity’s best interest to understand the Supreme Lord. Unfortunately, the living entities have forgotten that this is in their best interest, and therefore *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* says, *na te viduḥ svārtha-gatiṁ hi viṣṇum* (*Bhāg.* 7.5.31).

Everyone wants to achieve life’s ultimate goal, but due to being absorbed in the material energy, we waste our time with sense gratification. Through the study of Vedic literatures — of which the essence is the *Bhagavad-gītā* — one comes to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Thus one engages in devotional service, called *abhidheya.* When the living entity actually develops love of Godhead, he has reached the ultimate goal, *prayojana.* In other words, one who becomes fully Kṛṣṇa conscious has attained the perfection of life.

### Translation

### Purport

Sometimes we go to an astrologer or palmist when we are in a distressed condition or when we want to know the future. The living entity in conditioned life is always distressed by the threefold miseries of material existence. Under the circumstances, he is inquisitive about his position. For instance, Sanātana Gosvāmī approached the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, to ask Him why he was in a distressed condition. This is the position of all conditioned souls. We are always in a distressed condition, and an intelligent man naturally becomes inquisitive. This position is called *brahma-jijñāsā. Athāto brahma-jijñāsā* (*Vedānta-sūtra* 1.1.1). *Brahma* here refers to the Vedic literature. One should consult the Vedic literature to know why the conditioned soul is always in a distressed condition. The Vedic literatures are meant to free the conditioned soul from the miserable conditions of material existence. In this chapter, the story of the astrologer Sarvajña and the poor man is very instructive.

### Translation

**“By the words of the astrologer, the poor man’s connection with the treasure was established. Similarly, the Vedic literature advises us that our real connection is with Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.**

### Purport

In the *Bhagavad-gītā* (7.26), Śrī Kṛṣṇa says:

*vedāhaṁ samatītāni* *vartamānāni cārjuna  
bhaviṣyāṇi ca bhūtāni* *māṁ tu veda na kaścana*

“O Arjuna, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, I know everything that has happened in the past, all that is happening in the present, and all things that are yet to come. I also know all living entities, but Me no one knows.”

Thus Kṛṣṇa knows the cause of the distressed condition of the conditioned soul. He therefore descends from His original position to instruct the conditioned soul and inform him about his forgetfulness of his relationship with Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa exhibits Himself in His relationships in Vṛndāvana and at the Battle of Kurukṣetra so that people will be attracted to Him and will return home, back to Godhead. Kṛṣṇa also says in the *Bhagavad-gītā* that He is the proprietor of all universes, the enjoyer of everything that be and the friend of everyone. *Bhoktāraṁ yajña-tapasāṁ sarva-loka-maheśvaram/ suhṛdaṁ sarva-bhutānāṁ* (Bg. 5.29). If we revive our original intimate relationship with Kṛṣṇa, our distressed condition in the material world will be mitigated. Everyone is trying to adjust to the distressed conditions of material existence, but the basic problems cannot be solved unless one is in an intimate relationship with Kṛṣṇa.

### Translation

### Purport

The Vedic literatures, including the *Purāṇas,* state that according to the position of the conditioned soul, there are different processes — *karma-kāṇḍa, jñāna-kāṇḍa,* the yogic process and the *bhakti-yoga* process. *Karma-kāṇḍa* is compared to wasps and drones that will simply bite if one takes shelter of them. *Jñāna-kāṇḍa,* the speculative process, is simply like a ghost who creates mental disturbances. *Yoga,* the mystic process, is compared to a black snake that devours people by the impersonal cultivation of *kaivalya.* However, if one takes to *bhakti-yoga,* he becomes quickly successful. In other words, through *bhakti-yoga,* one’s hands touch the hidden treasure without difficulty.

The goal of all the revealed scriptures and Vedic injunctions is Kṛṣṇa, as He Himself says in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (15.15): *vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyaḥ.* Since the *Vedas* enjoin one to search out Kṛṣṇa and take shelter at His lotus feet, and since no Vedic process but devotional service will enable one to do this, one has to take to devotional service. According to the *Bhagavad-gītā* (18.55), only the *bhakti* process is said to be definitive. *Bhaktyā mām abhijānāti.* This is the conclusive statement of the *Vedas,* and one has to accept this process if one is serious in searching for Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In this connection, Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura gives the following statement: “The eastern side represents devotional service to Lord Kṛṣṇa. The southern side represents the process of fruitive activity (*karma-kāṇḍa*), which ends in material gain. The western side represents *jñāna-kāṇḍa,* the process of mental speculation, or sometimes *siddhi-kāṇḍa,* the mystic *yoga* system. The northern side represents mystic *yoga,* or sometimes the speculative method.” It is only the eastern side, devotional service, that enables one to attain life’s real goal. On the southern side, there are fruitive activities, by which one is subject to the punishment of Yamarāja. When one follows the system of fruitive activity, his material desires remain prominent. Consequently the results of this process are compared to wasps and drones. The living entity is bitten by the wasps and drones of fruitive activity and thus suffers in material existence birth after birth. One cannot become free from material desires by following this process. The propensity for material enjoyment never ends. Therefore the cycle of birth and death continues, and the spirit soul suffers perpetually.

The mystic *yoga* process is compared to a black snake that devours the living entity and injects him with poison. The ultimate goal of the *yoga* system is to become one with the Absolute. This means finishing one’s personal existence. But the spiritual part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead has an eternal individual existence. The *Bhagavad-gītā* confirms that the individual soul existed in the past, is existing in the present and will continue to exist as an individual in the future. Artificially trying to become one with the Absolute is suicidal. One cannot annihilate his natural condition.

A *yakṣa,* a protector of riches, will not allow anyone to take away riches for enjoyment. Such a demon will simply create disturbances. In other words, a devotee will not depend on his material resources but on the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who can give real protection. This is called *rakṣiṣyatīti viśvāsaḥ* or (in the Bengali poetry of Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura’s *Śaraṇāgati*) *‘avaśya rakṣibe kṛṣṇa’ — viśvāsa pālana.* The surrendered soul must accept the fact that his real protector is Kṛṣṇa, not his material acquisitions.

Considering all these points, devotional service to Kṛṣṇa is the real treasure house for the living entity. When one comes to the platform of devotional service, he always remains opulent in the association of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One who is bereft of devotional service is swallowed by the black snake of the *yoga* system and bitten by the wasps and drones of fruitive activity, and he suffers consequent material miseries. Sometimes the living entity is misled into trying to merge into spiritual existence, thinking himself as good as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This means that when he comes to the spiritual platform, he will be disturbed and will again return to the material platform. According to *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (10.2.32):

*ye ’nye ’ravindākṣa vimukta-māninas *
 *tvayy asta-bhāvād aviśuddha-buddhayaḥ  
āruhya kṛcchreṇa paraṁ padaṁ tataḥ *
 *patanty adho ’nādṛta-yuṣmad-aṅghrayaḥ*

Such people may become *sannyāsīs,* but unless they take shelter of Kṛṣṇa’s lotus feet, they will return to the material platform to perform philanthropic activities. In this way, one’s spiritual life is lost. This is to be understood as being devoured by the black snake.

“One can understand Me as I am, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, only by devotional service. And when one is in full consciousness of Me by such devotion, he can enter into the kingdom of God.”

The aim of life is to get rid of the material conditioning and enter into spiritual existence. Although the *śāstras* prescribe different methods for different men, the Supreme Personality of Godhead says that one ultimately must accept the path of devotional service as the assured path of spiritual advancement. Devotional service to the Lord is the only process actually confirmed by the Lord. *Sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja* (Bg. 18.66). One must become a devotee if one wants to return home, back to Godhead, and become eternally blissful.

The goal of devotional service is to be eternally situated in the loving service of the Lord and to enjoy spiritual bliss from that service.

One has to end such a life of poverty in order to automatically end the miserable conditions of material existence. One is automatically liberated from material enjoyment when one tastes the service of Kṛṣṇa. One does not have to endeavor separately for opulence. Opulence automatically comes to the pure devotee, even though he does not desire material happiness.

### Translation

**“\[Lord Kṛṣṇa said:\] ‘What is the purpose of all Vedic literatures? On whom do they focus? Who is the object of all speculation? Outside of Me no one knows these things. Now you should know that all these activities are aimed at ordaining and setting forth Me. The purpose of the Vedic literatures is to know Me by different speculations, either by indirect understanding or by dictionary understanding. Everyone is speculating about Me. The essence of all Vedic literatures is to distinguish Me from māyā. By considering the illusory energy, one comes to the platform of understanding Me. In this way one becomes free from speculation about the Vedas and comes to Me as the conclusion. Thus one is satisfied.’**

### Purport

These two verses are quoted from *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (11.21.42-43). When Uddhava asked Kṛṣṇa about the purpose of Vedic speculation, the Lord informed him of the process of understanding the Vedic literature. The *Vedas* are composed of *karma-kāṇḍa, jñāna-kāṇḍa* and *upāsanā-kāṇḍa.* One who analytically studies the purpose of the *Vedas* understands that by *karma-kāṇḍa,* sacrificial activity, one comes to the conclusion of *jñāna-kāṇḍa,* speculative knowledge, and that after speculation one comes to the conclusion that worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the ultimate. When one comes to this conclusion, he becomes fully satisfied.

### Purport

This is a quotation from the *Bhāvārtha-dīpikā,* Śrīdhara Svāmī’s commentary on *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (10.1.1). In the Tenth Canto of *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* there is a description of the *āśraya-tattva,* Śrī Kṛṣṇa. There are two *tattvas — āśraya-tattva* and *āśrita-tattva. Āśraya-tattva* is the objective, and *āśrita-tattva* is the subjective. Since the lotus feet of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa are the shelter of all devotees, Śrī Kṛṣṇa is called *paraṁ dhāma.* In the *Bhagavad-gītā* (10.12) it is stated, *paraṁ brahma paraṁ dhāma pavitraṁ paramaṁ bhavān.* Everything is resting under the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa. In *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (10.14.58) it is stated:

*samāśritā ye pada-pallava-plavaṁ *
 *mahat-padaṁ puṇya-yaśo murāreḥ*

Under the lotus feet of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the entire *mahat-tattva* is existing. Since everything is under Śrī Kṛṣṇa’s protection, Śrī Kṛṣṇa is called *āśraya-tattva.* Everything else is called *āśrita-tattva.* The material creation is also called *āśrita-tattva.* Liberation from material bondage and the attainment of the spiritual platform are also *āśrita-tattva.* Kṛṣṇa is the only *āśraya-tattva.* In the beginning of the creation there are Mahā-Viṣṇu, Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu and Kṣīrodakaśāyī Viṣṇu. They are also *āśraya-tattva.* Kṛṣṇa is the cause of all causes (*sarva-kāraṇa-kāraṇam*)*.* To understand Kṛṣṇa perfectly, one has to make an analytical study of *āśraya-tattva* and *āśrita-tattva.*

Those who are interested in the impersonal Brahman effulgence, which is not different from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, can attain that goal by speculative knowledge.

As stated in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (18.61), *īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ hṛd-deśe ’rjuna tiṣṭhati:* the Supreme Personality of Godhead is situated within the heart as Paramātmā. He witnesses the activities of the living entities and gives them permission to act.

### Purport

This is a quotation from *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (10.14.55). Parīkṣit Mahārāja asked Śukadeva Gosvāmī why Kṛṣṇa was so beloved by the residents of Vṛndāvana, who loved Him even more than their own offspring or life itself. At that time Śukadeva Gosvāmī replied that everyone’s *ātmā,* or soul, is very, very dear, especially to all living entities who have accepted material bodies. But that *ātmā,* the spirit soul, is part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa. For this reason, Kṛṣṇa is very dear to every living entity. Everyone’s body is very dear to oneself, and one wants to protect the body by all means because within the body the soul is living. Due to the intimate relationship between the soul and the body, the body is important and dear to everyone. Similarly, the soul, being part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Lord, is very, very dear to all living entities. Unfortunately, the soul forgets his constitutional position and thinks he is only the body (*deha-ātma-buddhi*)*.* Thus the soul is subjected to the rules and regulations of material nature. When a living entity, by his intelligence, reawakens his attraction for Kṛṣṇa, he can understand that he is not the body but part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa. Thus filled with knowledge, he no longer labors under attachment to the body and everything related to the body. *Janasya moho ’yam ahaṁ mameti.* Material existence, wherein one thinks, “I am the body, and this belongs to me,” is also illusory. One must redirect his attraction to Kṛṣṇa. *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (1.2.7) states:

*vāsudeve bhagavati* *bhakti-yogaḥ prayojitaḥ  
janayaty āśu vairāgyaṁ* *jñānaṁ ca yad ahaitukam*

“By rendering devotional service unto the Personality of Godhead, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, one immediately acquires causeless knowledge and detachment from the world.”

### Translation

**“The Supreme Personality of Godhead exists in three principal forms — svayaṁ-rūpa, tad-ekātma-rūpa and āveśa-rūpa.**

### Purport

Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī has described the *svayaṁ-rūpa* in his *Laghu-bhāgavatāmṛta, Pūrva-khaṇḍa,* verse 12: *ananyāpekṣi yad rūpaṁ svayaṁ-rūpaḥ sa ucyate.* “The form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead that does not depend on other forms is called the *svayaṁ-rūpa,* the original form.” This form is also described in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam: kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam* (1.3.28). “Kṛṣṇa is the original form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.” That Kṛṣṇa’s form as a cowherd boy in Vṛndāvana is the original form of the Personality of Godhead (*svayaṁ-rūpa*) is confirmed in the *Brahma-saṁhitā* (5.1):

*īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ* *sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ  
anādir ādir govindaḥ* *sarva-kāraṇa-kāraṇam*

There is nothing superior to Govinda. He is the ultimate source and the cause of all causes. This is also confirmed in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (7.7), where the Lord says, *mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat:* “There is no truth superior to Me.”

The *tad-ekātma-rūpa* forms are also described in the *Laghu-bhāgavatāmṛta* (*Pūrva-khaṇḍa,* verse 14):

*yad rūpaṁ tad-abhedena* *svarūpeṇa virājate  
ākṛtyādibhir anyādṛk* *sa tad-ekātma-rūpakaḥ*

“The *tad-ekātma-rūpa* forms exist simultaneously with the *svayaṁ-rūpa* form and are nondifferent. At the same time, their bodily features and specific activities appear to be different.” The *tad-ekātma-rūpa* forms are divided into two categories — *svāṁśa* and *vilāsa.*

Lord Kṛṣṇa’s *āveśa* forms are also explained in the *Laghu-bhāgavatāmṛta* (*Pūrva* 18):

*jñāna-śakty-ādi-kalayā* *yatrāviṣṭo janārdanaḥ  
ta āveśā nigadyante* *jīvā eva mahattamāḥ*

“A living entity who is specifically empowered by the Lord with knowledge or strength is technically called *āveśa-rūpa.*” As stated in the *Caitanya-caritāmṛta* (*Antya* 7.11), *kṛṣṇa-śakti vinā nahe tāra pravartana:* Unless a devotee is specifically empowered by the Lord, he cannot preach the holy name of the Lord all over the world. This is an explanation of the word *āveśa-rūpa.*

### Translation

**“ ‘In different Vedic scriptures, there are prescribed rules and regulative principles for worshiping different types of forms. When one is purified by these rules and regulations, he worships You, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Although manifested in many forms, You are one.’**

### Purport

This verse is quoted from *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (10.40.7). In the *Vedas* it is stated that the one becomes many (*eko bahu syām*)*.* The Supreme Personality of Godhead expands Himself in various forms — *viṣṇu-tattva, jīva-tattva* and *śakti-tattva.*

According to the Vedic literatures, there are different regulative principles for the worship of each of these forms. If one takes advantage of the Vedic literatures and purifies himself by following the rules and regulations, ultimately he worships the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa says in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (4.11): *mama vartmānuvartante manuṣyāḥ pārtha sarvaśaḥ.* Worship of the demigods is in a sense worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but such worship is said to be *avidhi-pūrvakam,* improper. Actually demigod worship is meant for unintelligent men. One who is intelligent considers the words of the Supreme Personality of Godhead: *sarva dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja.* One who worships demigods worships the Supreme Lord indirectly, but according to the revealed scriptures, there is no need to worship Him indirectly. One can worship Him directly.

### Purport

To understand the difference between *svayaṁ-rūpa, tad-ekātma-rūpa, āveśa, prābhava* and *vaibhava,* Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura has given the following description. In the beginning, Kṛṣṇa has three bodily features: (1) *svayaṁ-rūpa,* as a cowherd boy in Vṛndāvana; (2) *tad-ekātma-rūpa,* which is divided into *svāṁśaka* and *vilāsa;* and (3) *āveśa-rūpa.* The *svāṁśaka,* or expansions of the personal potency, are (1) Kāraṇodakaśāyī, Garbhodakaśāyī, Kṣīrodakaśāyī and (2) incarnations such as the fish, tortoise, boar and Nṛsiṁha. The *vilāsa-rūpa* has a *prābhava* division, including Vāsudeva, Saṅkarṣaṇa, Pradyumna and Aniruddha. There is also a *vaibhava* division, in which there are twenty-four forms, including the second Vāsudeva, Saṅkarṣaṇa, Pradyumna and Aniruddha. For each of these, there are three forms; therefore there are twelve forms altogether. These twelve forms constitute the predominant names for the twelve months of the year as well as the twelve *tilaka* marks on the body. Each of the four Personalities of Godhead expands into two other forms; thus there are eight forms, such as Puruṣottama, Acyuta, etc. The four forms (Vāsudeva, etc.), the twelve (Keśava, etc.), and the eight (Puruṣottama, etc.) all together constitute twenty-four forms. The forms are differently named in accordance with the placement of the weapons They hold in Their four hands.

### Purport

The Lord’s *vilāsa* expansions are described in the following verse from the *Laghu-bhāgavatāmṛta* (1.15):

*svarūpam anyākāraṁ yat* *tasya bhāti vilāsataḥ  
prāyeṇātma-samaṁ śaktyā* *sa vilāso nigadyate*

“When the Lord displays numerous forms with different features by His inconceivable potency, such forms are called *vilāsa-vigrahas*.”

The Lord’s *svāṁśa* expansions are also described in the *Laghu-bhāgavatāmṛta* (1.17):

*tādṛśo nyūna-śaktiṁ yo* *vyanakti svāṁśa īritaḥ  
saṅkarṣaṇādir matsyādir* *yathā tat-tat-svadhāmasu*

When a form of Kṛṣṇa is nondifferent from the original form but is less important and exhibits less potency, it is called *svāṁśa.* Examples of *svāṁśa* expansions can be found in the quadruple forms of the Lord residing in Their respective places, beginning with Saṅkarṣaṇa, Vāsudeva, Pradyumna and Aniruddha, and also in the *puruṣa-avatāras, līlā-avatāras, manvantara-avatāras* and *yuga-avatāras.*

### Translation

**“At Viṣṇu-kāñcī there is Lord Viṣṇu, at Māyāpur Lord Hari, and throughout the universe a variety of other forms.**

### Purport

All of these forms are *mūrti* forms, and They are worshiped in the temples. Their names are Keśava at Mathurā, Puruṣottama or Jagannātha at Nīlācala, Śrī Bindu Mādhava at Prayāga, Madhusūdana at Mandāra, and Vāsudeva, Padmanābha and Janārdana at Ānandāraṇya, which is situated in Kerala, South India. At Viṣṇu-kāñcī is Lord Varadarāja, and Hari is situated at Māyāpur, Lord Caitanya’s birth site. Thus in different places throughout the universe there are various Deities in temples bestowing Their causeless mercy upon the devotees. All these Deity forms are nondifferent from the *mūrtis* in the spiritual world of the Vaikuṇṭhas. Although the *arcā-mūrti,* the worshipable Deity form of the Lord, appears to be made of material elements, it is as good as the spiritual forms found in the spiritual Vaikuṇṭhalokas. The Deity in the temple, however, is visible to the material eyes of the devotee. It is not possible for one in material, conditioned life to see the spiritual form of the Lord. To bestow causeless mercy upon us, the Lord appears as the *arcā-mūrti* so that we can see Him. It is forbidden to consider the *arcā-mūrti* to be made of stone or wood. In the *Padma Purāṇa* it is said:

*arcye viṣṇau śilā-dhīr guruṣu nara-matir vaiṣṇave jāti-buddhir *
 *viṣṇor vā vaiṣṇsnavānāṁ kali-mala-mathane pāda-tīrthe ’mbu-buddhiḥ  
śrī-viṣṇor nāmni mantre sakala-kaluṣa-he śabda-sāmānya-buddhir *
 *viṣṇau sarveśvareśe tad-itara-sama-dhīr yasya vā nārakī saḥ*

No one should consider the Deity in the temple to be made of stone or wood, nor should one consider the spiritual master an ordinary human being. No one should consider a Vaiṣṇava to belong to a particular caste or creed, and no one should consider *caraṇāmṛta* or Ganges water to be like ordinary water. Nor should anyone consider the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra* to be a material vibration. All these expansions of Kṛṣṇa in the material world are simply demonstrations of the Lord’s mercy and willingness to give facility to His devotees who are engaged in His devotional service within the material world.

### Purport

In the material world, the Lord is situated in different *arcā-mūrtis* (Deities) in the temples just to decrease the material activities of the conditioned soul and increase his spiritual activities. Particularly in India there are many temples throughout the country. Devotees may take advantage of them and go see the Lord at Jagannātha Purī, Vṛndāvana, Prayāga, Mathurā, Hardwar and Viṣṇu-kāñcī. When the devotees travel to these places and see the Lord, they become very happy in devotional service.

The *puruṣa-avatāras* are the Lords of the universal creation. These are Kāraṇodakaśāyī Viṣṇu, Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu and Kṣīrodakaśāyī Viṣṇu. There are also *līlā-avatāras,* and these include (1) Catuḥsana, or the four Kumāras, (2) Nārada, (3) Varāha, (4) Matsya, (5) Yajña, (6) Nara-Nārāyaṇa, (7) Kārdami Kapila, (8) Dattātreya, (9) Hayaśīrṣā, (10) Haṁsa, (11) Dhruvapriya, or Pṛśnigarbha, (12) Ṛṣabha, (13) Pṛthu, (14) Nṛsiṁha, (15) Kūrma, (16) Dhanvantari, (17) Mohinī, (18) Vāmana, (19) Bhārgava Paraśurāma, (20) Rāghavendra, (21) Vyāsa, (22) Pralambāri Balarāma, (23) Kṛṣṇa, (24) Buddha and (25) Kalki.

These twenty-five Personalities of Godhead are known as *līlā-avatāras.* Because they appear in each day of Brahmā, or in each *kalpa* (millennium), they are sometimes known as *kalpa-avatāras.* Of these incarnations, Haṁsa and Mohinī are neither permanent nor very well known, but They are listed among the *prābhava-avatāras.* Kapila, Dattātreya, Ṛṣabha, Dhanvantari and Vyāsa are eternally situated and very widely known. They are also counted among the *prābhava* incarnations. Kūrma, Matsya, Nārāyaṇa, Varāha, Hayagrīva, Pṛśnigarbha and Baladeva, the killer of Pralambāsura, are counted among the *vaibhava-avatāras.*

### Purport

The *guṇa-avatāras* are three — Lord Brahmā, Lord Śiva and Lord Viṣṇu (*Bhāg*. 10.88.3). The *avatāras* who appear during the reign of each Manu, known as *manvantara-avatāras,* are listed as follows in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (Eighth Canto, chapters 1, 5 and 13): (1) Yajña, (2) Vibhu, (3) Satyasena, (4) Hari, (5) Vaikuṇṭha, (6) Ajita, (7) Vāmana, (8) Sārvabhauma, (9) Ṛṣabha, (10) Viṣvaksena, (11) Dharmasetu, (12) Sudhāmā, (13) Yogeśvara and (14) Bṛhadbhānu. All together these are fourteen in number, and of these, Yajña and Vāmana are also counted among the *līlā-avatāras.* All these *manvantara* incarnations are sometimes called *vaibhava-avatāras.*

The four *yuga-avatāras* are (1) *śukla* (white) in Satya-yuga (*Bhāg.* 11.5.21), (2) *rakta* (red) in Tretā-yuga (*Bhāg.* 11.5.24), (3) *śyāma* (dark blue) in Dvāpara-yuga (*Bhāg.* 11.5.27) and (4) generally *kṛṣṇa* (black) but in special cases *pīta* (yellow) as Caitanya Mahāprabhu in Kali-yuga (*Bhāg.* 11.5.32 and 10.8.13).

The *śaktyāveśa-avatāras* are categorized into (1) forms of divine absorption (*bhagavad-āveśa*), such as Kapiladeva or Ṛṣabhadeva, and (2) divinely empowered forms (*śaktyāveśa*), of whom seven are foremost: (1) Śeṣa Nāga in the Vaikuṇṭha world, empowered for the personal service of the Supreme Lord (*sva-sevana-śakti*), (2) Anantadeva, empowered to bear all the planets within the universe (*bhū-dhāraṇa-śakti*), (3) Lord Brahmā, empowered with the energy to create the cosmic manifestation (*sṛṣṭi-śakti*), (4) Catuḥsana, or the Kumāras, specifically empowered to distribute transcendental knowledge (*jñāna-śakti*), (5) Nārada Muni, empowered to distribute devotional service (*bhakti-śakti*), (6) Mahārāja Pṛthu, specifically empowered to rule and maintain the living entities (*pālana-śakti*) and (7) Paraśurāma, specifically empowered to cut down rogues and demons (*duṣṭa-damana-śakti*)*.*

*ananta* — unlimited; *avatāra* — incarnations; *kṛṣṇera* — of Lord Kṛṣṇa; *nāhika* *gaṇana* — there is no possibility of counting; *śākhā*-*candra*-*nyāya* — by the example of the moon and the branches of a tree; *kari* — I make; *dik*-*daraśana* — a slight indication.

### Translation

**“There are innumerable incarnations of Kṛṣṇa, and there is no possibility of counting them. We can simply indicate them by giving the example of the moon and the branches of a tree.**

### Purport

Although the moon appears to be located in the branches of a tree, it is actually situated very far away. Similarly, none of the *avatāras,* or incarnations, of Lord Kṛṣṇa are within this material world, but they are visible by the causeless mercy of the Lord. We should not consider them to belong to this material world. As stated by Lord Kṛṣṇa in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (Bg. 9.11):

*avajānanti māṁ mūḍhā* *mānuṣīṁ tanum āśritam  
paraṁ bhāvam ajānanto* *mama bhūta-maheśvaram*

“Fools deride Me when I descend in the human form. They do not know My transcendental nature as the Supreme Lord of all that be.”

*Avatāras* descend of their own free will, and although they may act like ordinary human beings, they do not belong to this material world. Lord Kṛṣṇa and His *avatāras* can be understood only by the grace of the Lord.

*nāyam ātmā pravacanena labhyo *
 *na medhayā na bahunā śrutena  
yam evaiṣa vṛṇute tena labhyas *
 *tasyaiṣa ātmā vivṛṇute tanūṁ svām*

(*Kaṭha Upaniṣad* 1.2.23)

“The Supreme Lord is not obtained by means of expert explanations, vast intelligence or even much hearing. He is obtained only by one whom He Himself chooses. To such a person, He manifests His own form.”

*athāpi te deva padāmbuja-dvaya- *
 *prasāda-leśānugṛhīta eva hi  
jānāti tattvaṁ bhagavan-mahimno *
 *na cānya eko ’pi ciraṁ vicinvan*

(*Bhāg.* 10.14.29)

“My Lord, if one is favored by even a slight trace of the mercy of Your lotus feet, he can understand the greatness of Your personality. But those who speculate to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead are unable to know You, even though they continue studying the *Vedas* for many years.”

### Translation

**“When the Supreme Personality of Godhead glances over the material energy, she becomes agitated. At that time, the Lord injects the original semen of the living entities.**

### Purport

In the *Bhagavad-gītā* (7.10), Kṛṣṇa says, *bījaṁ māṁ sarva-bhūtānām:* “I am the original seed of all existences.” This is also confirmed in another verse in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (14.4):

*sarva-yoniṣu kaunteya* *mūrtayaḥ sambhavanti yāḥ  
tāsāṁ brahma mahad yonir* *ahaṁ bīja-pradaḥ pitā*

“It should be understood that all species of life, O son of Kuntī, are made possible by birth in this material nature, and that I am the seed-giving father.”

For a further explanation, one may refer to the *Brahma-saṁhitā* (chapter five, verses 10-13). The *Brahma-saṁhitā* also states (5.51):

*agnir mahī gaganam ambu marud diśaś ca *
 *kālas tathātma-manasīti jagat-trayāṇi  
yasmād bhavanti vibhavanti viśanti yaṁ ca *
 *govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi*

All material elements, as well as the spiritual sparks (individual souls), are emanating from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is confirmed by the *Vedānta-sūtra* (1.1): *janmādy asya yataḥ.* “The Absolute Truth is He from whom everything emanates.” He is the Supreme Truth: *satyaṁ paraṁ dhīmahi* (*Bhāg.* 1.1.1). The absolute ultimate truth is Kṛṣṇa. *Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya/ janmādy asya yato ’nvayād itarataś cārtheṣv abhijñaḥ sva-rāṭ:* “The Absolute Truth is a person who is directly and indirectly cognizant of the entire cosmic manifestation.” (*Bhāg.* 1.1.1)

The Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, educated Lord Brahmā from the heart (*Bhāg.* 1.1.1): *tene brahma hṛdā ya ādi-kavaye.* Therefore the Absolute Truth cannot be dull matter; the Absolute Truth must be the Supreme Person Himself. *Sei puruṣa māyā-pāne kare avadhāna.* Simply by His glance, material nature is impregnated with all living entities. According to their *karma* and fruitive activity, they emerge in different bodies. That is the explanation given by the *Bhagavad-gītā* (2.13):

*dehino ’smin yathā dehe* *kaumāraṁ yauvanaṁ jarā  
tathā dehāntara-prāptir* *dhīras tatra na muhyati*

“As the embodied soul continuously passes, in this body, from boyhood to youth to old age, the soul similarly passes into another body at death. A sober person is not bewildered by such a change.”

### Translation

**“To impregnate with the seeds of the living entities, the Lord Himself does not directly touch the material energy, but by His specific functional expansion He touches the material energy, and thus the living entities, who are His parts and parcels, are impregnated into material nature.**

### Purport

According to Lord Kṛṣṇa in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (15.7):

*mamaivāṁśo jīva-loke* *jīva-bhūtaḥ sanātanaḥ  
manaḥ-ṣaṣṭhānīndriyāni* *prakṛti-sthāni karṣati*

“The living entities in this conditioned world are My eternal fragmental parts. Due to conditioned life, they are struggling very hard with the six senses, which include the mind.”

In the present verse of the *Caitanya-caritāmṛta,* the word *prakṛti-sparśana* refers to the Lord’s glancing over material nature and placing the living entities in contact with dull matter. The glancing is performed by Mahā-Viṣṇu: *sa aikṣata lokān nu sṛjā iti.* (*Aitareya Upaniṣad* 1.1.1) In the conditioned stage we impregnate according to the bodily conception — that is, by sexual intercourse — but the Supreme Lord does not need sexual intercourse to impregnate. The impregnation is performed simply by His glance. This is also explained in the *Brahma-saṁhitā* (5.32):

*aṅgāni yasya sakalendriya-vṛttimanti *
 *paśyanti pānti kalayanti ciraṁ jaganti  
ānanda-cinmaya-sad-ujjvala-vigrahasya *
 *govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi*

Govinda can impregnate simply by glancing. In other words, His eyes can work as His genitals. He does not need genitals to beget a child. Indeed, Kṛṣṇa can beget any one of the living entities with any part of His body.

The word *svāṅga-viśeṣābhāsa-rūpe,* indicating the form by which the Lord begets living entities in the material world, is explained herein. He is Lord Śiva. In the *Brahma-saṁhitā* it is stated that Lord Śiva, who is another form of Mahā-Viṣṇu, is like yogurt. Yogurt is nothing but milk, yet it is not milk. Similarly, Lord Śiva is considered the father of this universe, and material nature is considered the mother. The father and mother are known as Lord Śiva and goddess Durgā. Together, Lord Śiva’s genitals and the vagina of goddess Durgā are worshiped as the *śiva-liṅga.* This is the origin of the material creation. Thus Lord Śiva’s position is between that of the living entity and that of the Supreme Lord. In other words, Lord Śiva is neither the Supreme Personality of Godhead nor a living entity. He is the form through which the Supreme Lord works to beget living entities within this material world. As yogurt is prepared when milk is mixed with a culture, the form of Lord Śiva expands when the Supreme Personality of Godhead is in touch with material nature. The impregnation of material nature by the father, Lord Śiva, is wonderful because at one time innumerable living entities are conceived. *Bhāgo jīvaḥ sa vijñeyaḥ sa cānantyāya kalpate* (*Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad* 5.9). These living entities are very, very small:

*keśāgra-śata-bhāgasya* *śatāṁśa-sadṛśātmakaḥ  
jīvaḥ sūkṣma-svarūpo ’yaṁ* *saṅkhyātīto hi cit-kaṇaḥ*

“If we divide the tip of a hair into a hundred parts and then take one of these parts and divide it again into a hundred parts, that very fine division is the size of but one of the numberless living entities. They are all *cit-kaṇa,* particles of spirit, not matter.”

The innumerable *brahmāṇḍas,* or universes, come from the pores of the Lord’s body, and innumerable living entities also come from the pores of the transcendental body of the Lord. This is the process of material creation. Without the living entities, this material nature has no value. Both emanate from the pores of the transcendental body of Lord Mahā-Viṣṇu. They are different energies. The material nature is explained as follows by Lord Kṛṣṇa in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (7.4):

*bhūmir āpo ’nalo vāyuḥ* *khaṁ mano buddhir eva ca  
ahaṅkāra itīyaṁ me* *bhinnā prakṛtir aṣṭadhā*

“Earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence and false ego — all together these eight constitute My separated material energies.” Thus the material elements also come from the body of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but they are a different type of energy from the living entities. Although the living entities also come from the Lord’s body, they are categorized as a superior energy:

*apareyam itas tv anyāṁ* *prakṛtiṁ viddhi me parām  
jīva-bhūtāṁ mahā-bāho* *yayedaṁ dhāryate jagat*

“Besides this inferior nature, O mighty-armed Arjuna, there is another, superior energy of Mine, which comprises the living entities who are exploiting the resources of this material, inferior nature.” (Bg. 7.5) The inferior energy, matter, cannot act without the superior energy. All these things are very clearly explained in the *Vedas.* The materialistic theory that life develops from matter is incorrect. Life and matter come from the supreme living entity; therefore, being the source of both, that supreme living entity, Kṛṣṇa, is described in the *Vedānta-sūtra* as *janmādy asya yataḥ* (1.1), or the original source of everything, *sarva-kāraṇa-kāraṇam.* This is further explained in the following verse.

### Translation

**“ ‘At a time beyond memory, after agitating the material nature into three qualities, the Supreme Personality of Godhead placed the semen of innumerable living entities within the womb of that material nature. Thus material nature gave birth to the total material energy, known as the hiraṇmaya-mahat-tattva, the original symbolic representation of the cosmic manifestation.’**

### Purport

This is a quotation from *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (3.26.19). Lord Kapila is explaining to His mother the relationship between the Supreme Personality of Godhead and material nature. He is informing her how the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the original cause of the living entities who are conditioned by material nature. Over and above the twenty-eight elements of the material creation is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the cause of all causes. Life comes not from matter but from life itself. As explained in the *Vedas: nityo nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānām* (*Kaṭha Upaniṣad* 2.2.13). The Supreme Lord is the original source of life.

### Translation

**“ ‘In due course of time, the Supreme Personality of Godhead \[Mahā-Vaikuṇṭhanātha\], by the agency of an expansion of His personal self \[Mahā-Viṣṇu\], placed the seed of the living entities entities within the womb of material nature.’**

### Purport

This is a quotation from *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (3.5.26). This verse tells how the living entities come in contact with material nature. Just as a woman cannot beget children without uniting with a man, material nature cannot beget living entities without being in union with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. There is a history of how the Absolute Lord becomes the father of all living entities. In every system of religion, it is accepted that God is the supreme father of all living entities. According to Christianity, the supreme father, God, provides the living entities with all of life’s necessities. Therefore they pray, “Give us this day our daily bread.” Any religion that does not accept the Supreme Lord as the absolute father is called *kaitava-dharma,* or a cheating religion. Such religious systems are rejected in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (1.1.2): *dharmaḥ projjhita-kaitavo ’tra.* Only an atheist does not accept the omnipotent supreme father. If one accepts the omnipotent supreme father, he abides by His orders and becomes a religious person.

yāhā haite devatendriya-bhūtera pracāra*

### Synonyms

*tabe* — thereafter; *mahat*-*tattva* *haite* — from the total material energy; *tri*-*vidha* — three kinds of; *ahaṅkāra* — egotism; *yāhā* *haite* — from which; *devatā* — of predominating deities; *indriya* — of the senses; *bhūtera* — and of material elements; *pracāra* — expansion.

### Translation

**“First the total material energy is manifested, and from this arise the three types of egotism, which are the original sources from which all demigods \[controlling deities\], senses and material elements expand.**

### Purport

The three types of egotism (*ahaṅkāra*) are technically known as *vaikārika, taijasa* and *tāmasa.* The *mahat-tattva* is situated within the heart, or *citta,* and the predominating Deity of the *mahat-tattva* is Lord Vāsudeva (*Bhāg.* 3.26.21). The *mahat-tattva* is transformed into three divisions: (1) *vaikārika,* egotism in goodness (*sāttvika-ahaṅkāra*), from which is manifested the eleventh sense organ, the mind, whose predominating Deity is Aniruddha (*Bhāg.* 3.26.27-28); (2) *taijasa,* or egotism in passion (*rājasa-ahaṅkāra*), from which are manifested the active and knowledge-acquiring senses, along with the intelligence, whose predominating Deity is Lord Pradyumna (*Bhāg.* 3.26.29-31); and (3) *tāmasa,* or egotism in ignorance, from which sound vibration (*śabda-tanmātra*) expands. From sound vibration, the sky (*ākāśa*) is manifested, and then the senses, beginning with the sense of hearing, are also manifested (*Bhāg.* 3.26.32). Of these three types of egotism, Lord Saṅkarṣaṇa is the predominating Deity. In the philosophical discourse known as the *Sāṅkhya-kārikā,* it is stated, *sāttvika ekādaśakaḥ pravartate vaikṛtād ahaṅkārāt* — *bhūtādes tan-mātraṁ tāmasa-taijasādy-ubhayam.*

*viṣṇu*-*rūpa* — Lord Kṛṣṇa in His form as Viṣṇu; *hañā* — becoming; *kare* — does; *jagat* *pālane* — maintenance of the material world; *guṇa*-*atīta* — beyond the material qualities, transcendental; *viṣṇu* — Lord Viṣṇu; *sparśa* — touching; *nāhi* — there is not; *māyā*-*sane* — with *māyā,* the material energy.

### Translation

**“In this way, the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His form of Viṣṇu maintains the entire material world. Since He is always beyond the material qualities, the material nature cannot touch Him.**

### Purport

The influence of the material energy cannot touch Lord Viṣṇu as she touches Lord Brahmā and Lord Śiva. Therefore it is said that Lord Viṣṇu is transcendental to the material qualities. The incarnations of the material qualities — Lord Śiva and Lord Brahmā — are under the jurisdiction of the external energy. Lord Viṣṇu, however, is different. In the *mantras* of the *Ṛg Veda* it is said, *oṁ tad viṣṇoḥ paramaṁ padam* (*Ṛg Veda-saṁhitā* 1.22.20). The words *paramaṁ padam* indicate that He is transcendental to the material qualities. Because Lord Viṣṇu is not within the jurisdiction of the material qualities, He is always superior to the living entities who are controlled by the material energy. This is one of the differences between the Supreme Lord and the living entities. Lord Brahmā is a very powerful living entity, and Lord Śiva is even more powerful. Therefore Lord Śiva is not accepted as a living entity, but at the same time he is not considered to be on the level of Lord Viṣṇu.

Indeed, You diminished this burden formerly by incarnating in the form of a fish, a horse \[Hayagrīva\], a tortoise, a lion \[Lord Nṛsiṁha\], a boar \[Lord Varāha\] and a swan. You also incarnated as Lord Rāmacandra, Paraśurāma and Vāmana, the dwarf. You have always protected us demigods and the universe in this way. Now please continue.’**

### Translation

**“There are three functions within this material world. Everything here is created, everything is maintained for some time, and everything is finally dissolved. The Lord therefore incarnates Himself as the controllers of the three qualities — sattva-guṇa, rajo-guṇa and tamo-guṇa \[goodness, passion and ignorance\].

### Translation

**“Such a devotee is empowered by Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu. In this way, an incarnation of Kṛṣṇa in the form of Brahmā engineers the total creation of the universe.**

### Purport

The Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu *puruṣa-avatāra* expansion of Lord Viṣṇu accepts the material modes — *sattva-guṇa, rajo-guṇa* and *tamo-guṇa* — and thus incarnates as Lord Viṣṇu, Brahmā and Śiva. These are incarnations of the material qualities. Among the many superior living entities qualified with pious activities and devotional service, one, called Lord Brahmā, is infused with the quality of passion by the supreme will of Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu. Thus Lord Brahmā becomes the incarnation of the creative energy of the Lord.

### Synonyms

*nija*-*aṁśa* — of His personal plenary expansion; *kalāya* — by an expansion known as *kalā*; *kṛṣṇa* — Lord Kṛṣṇa; *tamaḥ*-*guṇa* — the material mode of darkness; *aṅgīkari’* — accepting; *saṁhāra*-*arthe* — for the purpose of dissolution; *māyā*-*saṅge* — in association with the external energy; *rudra*-*rūpa* — the form of Rudra; *dhari* — assumes.

### Translation

**“Lord Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, expands a portion of His plenary portion and, accepting the association of the material mode of ignorance, assumes the form of Rudra to dissolve the cosmic manifestation.**

### Purport

This is a description of the Rudra form, which is another expansion of Kṛṣṇa. Only *viṣṇu-mūrtis* are expansions of Kṛṣṇa’s personal and plenary portions. Mahā-Viṣṇu, who lies on the Causal Ocean, is an expansion of Saṅkarṣaṇa. When Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu accepts the material modes of nature for the purpose of dissolving the cosmic manifestation, His form is called Rudra. As already explained, Lord Viṣṇu is the controller of *māyā.* How, then, can He associate with *māyā*? The conclusion is that the incarnation of Lord Śiva or Lord Brahmā indicates the absence of the supreme power of Viṣṇu. When the supreme power is not there, it is possible to associate with *māyā,* the external energy. Lord Brahmā and Lord Śiva are to be considered creations of *māyā.*

### Purport

Rudra is simultaneously one with and different from the *viṣṇu-tattva.* Due to his association with *māyā,* he is different from the *viṣṇu-tattva,* but at the same time he is an expansion of Kṛṣṇa’s personal form. This situation is called *bhedābheda-tattva* or *acintya-bhedābheda-tattva,* simultaneously one and different.

### Translation

**“Milk is transformed into yogurt when it associates with a yogurt culture. Thus yogurt is nothing but milk, but still it is not milk.**

### Purport

Of the three deities supervising the creation, maintenance and dissolution of the universe, Lord Viṣṇu is never separate from the original Viṣṇu. However, Lord Śiva and Brahmā, due to their association with *māyā,* are different from Viṣṇu. Viṣṇu cannot be transformed into any form of material energy. Whenever there is association with *māyā,* the personality involved must be different from Lord Viṣṇu. Therefore Lord Śiva and Lord Brahmā are called *guṇa-avatāras,* for they associate with the material qualities. The conclusion is that Rudra is not exactly Lord Viṣṇu but rather a transformation of Viṣṇu. Therefore, he does not come within the category of the *viṣṇu-tattvas.* Thus he is inconceivably one with Viṣṇu and different from Him. The example given in this verse is very clear. Milk is compared to Viṣṇu. As soon as milk touches a sour substance, it becomes yogurt, or Lord Śiva. Although yogurt is constitutionally milk, it cannot be used in place of milk.

### Translation

**“Lord Śiva is an associate of the external energy; therefore he is absorbed in the material quality of darkness. Lord Viṣṇu is transcendental to māyā and the qualities of māyā. Therefore He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.**

### Purport

Viṣṇu is beyond the range of the material manifestation, and He is not within the control of the material energy. He is the supreme independent Personality of Godhead. This is admitted even by Śaṅkarācārya: *nārāyaṇaḥ paro ’vyaktāt* (*Gītā-bhāṣya*)*.* In his constitutional form, Śiva is a *mahā-bhāgavata,* a supreme devotee of the Lord, but because he accepts *māyā’s* association — especially the quality of ignorance — he is not free from *māyā’s* influence. Such an intimate association is completely absent in the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Viṣṇu. Lord Śiva accepts *māyā,* but in the presence of Lord Viṣṇu, *māyā* does not exist. Consequently Lord Śiva has to be considered a product of *māyā.* When Lord Śiva is free from *māyā’s* influence, he is in the position of a *mahā-bhāgavata,* a supreme devotee of Lord Viṣṇu. *Vaiṣṇavānāṁ yathā śambhuḥ.*

Although an incarnation of the material energy, Lord Brahmā is nonetheless the director of the material mode of passion.

Lord Viṣṇu is the original personal expansion of Kṛṣṇa, and Kṛṣṇa is the original source of all incarnations. As far as power is concerned, Lord Viṣṇu is as powerful as Lord Kṛṣṇa because He possesses all the opulences.

### Purport

This verse is quoted from *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (12.3.52). At the present moment in Kali-yuga there are many false meditators who concoct some imaginary form and try to meditate upon it. It has become fashionable to meditate, but people know nothing about the object of meditation. That is explained here. *Yad dhyāyato viṣṇum.* One has to meditate upon Lord Viṣṇu or Lord Kṛṣṇa. Without referring to the *śāstras,* so-called meditators aim at impersonal objects. Lord Kṛṣṇa has condemned them in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (12.5):

*kleśo ’dhikataras teṣām* *avyaktāsakta-cetasām  
avyaktā hi gatir duḥkhaṁ* *dehavadbhir avāpyate*

“For those whose minds are attached to the unmanifested, impersonal feature of the Supreme, advancement is very troublesome. To make progress in that discipline is always difficult for those who are embodied.” Not knowing how to meditate, foolish people simply suffer, and there is no benefit derived from their spiritual activities.

The same idea expressed in this verse from *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* can be found in the following verse from the *Viṣṇu Purāṇa* (6.2.17), *Padma Purāṇa* (*Uttara-khaṇḍa* 72.25) and *Bṛhan-nāradīya Purāṇa* (38.97).

This verse is very important in reference to the incarnations of God. At present there are especially many rascals prevalent in India who proclaim themselves incarnations of God or goddesses. Thus they are fooling and bluffing foolish people. On behalf of the general populace, Sanātana Gosvāmī presented himself as a foolish, lowborn, poorly behaved person, although he was a most exalted personality. Inferior people cannot accept the real God, yet they are very eager to accept an imitation God who can simply bluff foolish people. All this is going on in this Age of Kali. To guide these foolish people, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu answers the question as follows.

### Verse text

*prabhu kahe, — “anyāvatāra śāstra-dvāre jāni  
kalite avatāra taiche śāstra-vākye māni*

### Synonyms

*prabhu* *kahe* — Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu said; *anya*-*avatāra* — the incarnations in other *yugas*; *śāstra*-*dvāre* *jāni* — one has to accept by reference to the *śāstras*; *kalite* — in this Age of Kali; *avatāra* — incarnation; *taiche* — similarly; *śāstra*-*vākye* *māni* — one has to accept according to the description of revealed scriptures.

### Translation

**Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu replied, “As in other ages an incarnation is accepted according to the directions of the śāstras, in this Age of Kali an incarnation of God should be accepted in that way.**

### Purport

According to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, this is the way an incarnation should be accepted. Śrīla Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura says, *sādhu-śāstra-guru-vākya, cittete kariyā aikya.* One should accept a thing as genuine by studying the words of saintly people, the spiritual master and the *śāstra.* The actual center is the *śāstra,* the revealed scripture. If a spiritual master does not speak according to the revealed scripture, he is not to be accepted. Similarly, if a saintly person does not speak according to the *śāstra,* he is not a saintly person. The *śāstra* is the center for all. Unfortunately, at the present moment, people do not refer to the *śāstras;* therefore they accept rascals as incarnations, and consequently they have made incarnations into a very cheap thing. Intelligent people who follow Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s instructions and the instructions of the *ācārya,* the bona fide spiritual master, will not accept a pretender as an incarnation of God. In Kali-yuga, the only incarnation is Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Imitation incarnations take advantage of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. The Lord appeared within the past five hundred years, played as the son of a *brāhmaṇa* from Nadia and introduced the *saṅkīrtana* movement. Imitating Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and ignoring the *śāstra,* rascals present themselves as incarnations and introduce their rascaldom as a religious process. As we have repeatedly said, religion can be given only by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. From the discussions in the *Caitanya-caritāmṛta,* we can understand that in different ages the Supreme Lord introduces different systems and different religious duties. In this Age of Kali, the only incarnation of Kṛṣṇa is Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and He introduced the religious duty of Kali-yuga, the chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra:* Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare.

āmā-sabā jīvera haya śāstra-dvārā ‘jñāna’*

### Synonyms

*sarva*-*jña* *munira* *vākya* — the words of the omniscient *muni* (Vyāsadeva); *śāstra*-*paramāṇa* — evidence of revealed scriptures; *āmā*-*sabā* — all of us; *jīvera* — of the conditioned souls; *haya* — there is; *śāstra*-*dvārā* — through the medium of revealed scriptures; *jñāna* — knowledge.

### Translation

**“The Vedic literatures composed by the omniscient Mahāmuni Vyāsadeva are evidence of all spiritual existence. Only through these revealed scriptures can all conditioned souls attain knowledge.**

### Purport

Foolish people try to concoct knowledge by manufacturing something in their brains. That is not the real way of knowledge. Knowledge is *śabda-pramāṇa,* evidence from the Vedic literature. Śrīla Vyāsadeva is called Mahāmuni. He is also known as Vedavyāsa because he has compiled so many *śāstras.* He has divided the *Vedas* into four divisions — *Sāma, Ṛg, Yajur* and *Atharva.* He has expanded the *Vedas* into eighteen *Purāṇas* and has summarized Vedic knowledge in the *Vedānta-sūtra.* He also compiled the *Mahābhārata,* which is accepted as the fifth *Veda.* The *Bhagavad-gītā* is contained within the *Mahābhārata.* Therefore the *Bhagavad-gītā* is also Vedic literature (*smṛti*)*.* Some of the Vedic literatures are called *śrutis,* and some are called *smṛtis.* Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī recommends in the *Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu* (1.2.101):

*śruti-smṛti-purāṇādi-* *pañcarātra-vidhiṁ vinā  
aikāntikī harer bhaktir* *utpātāyaiva kalpate*

Unless one refers to *śāstra* (*śruti, smṛti* and *purāṇādi*), one’s spiritual activity simply disturbs society. There is no king or government to check people, and therefore society has fallen into a chaotic condition as far as spiritual understanding is concerned. Taking advantage of this chaotic condition, many rascals have appeared and proclaimed themselves incarnations of God. As a result, the entire population is indulging in sinful activities such as illicit sex, intoxication, gambling and meat-eating. Out of many sinful people, many so-called incarnations of God are emerging. This is a very regrettable situation, especially in India.

He is directly and indirectly conscious of all manifestations, and He is independent because there is no other cause beyond Him. It is He only who first imparted the Vedic knowledge unto the heart of Brahmājī, the original living being. By Him even the great sages and demigods are placed into illusion, as one is bewildered by the illusory representations of water seen in fire, or land seen on water. Only because of Him do the material universes, temporarily manifested by the reactions of the three modes of nature, appear factual, although they are unreal. I therefore meditate upon Him, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, who is eternally existent in the transcendental abode, which is forever free from the illusory representations of the material world. I meditate upon Him, for He is the Absolute Truth.’**

### Purport

This verse, quoted from *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (1.1.1), links the *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* with the *Vedānta-sūtra* with the words *janmādy asya yataḥ.* It is stated that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vāsudeva, is the Absolute Truth beyond the material creation. This has been accepted by all *ācāryas.* Even Śaṅkarācārya, the most elevated impersonalist, says in the beginning of his commentary on the *Bhagavad-gītā: nārāyaṇaḥ paro ’vyaktāt.* When this material creation is not yet manifested from the *mahat-tattva,* it is called *avyakta,* and when it is demonstrated from that total energy, it is called *vyakta.* Nārāyaṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is beyond this *vyakta-avyakta,* manifested and unmanifested material nature. This is the chief qualification of the Supreme Personality of Godhead when He assumes a particular incarnation. Kṛṣṇa tells Arjuna that although they both took birth many, many times before, Kṛṣṇa remembers everything about His previous appearances but Arjuna does not remember. Since Kṛṣṇa is beyond the cosmic creation, He is in the exalted position of being able to remember everything in the past. Everything within the cosmic creation has a material body, but Kṛṣṇa, being beyond the material cosmic creation, always has a spiritual body. He imparted Vedic knowledge into the heart of Brahmā. Although Brahmā is the most important and exalted personality within this universe, he could not remember what he did in his past life. Kṛṣṇa had to remind him through the heart. When Lord Brahmā was thus inspired, he was able to create the entire universe. Remembering everything about the past and inspiring Lord Brahmā to create are vivid examples of the characteristics called *svarūpa-lakṣaṇa* and *taṭastha-lakṣaṇa.*

### Purport

Sanātana Gosvāmī wanted to confirm the fact that Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is the incarnation of Kṛṣṇa for this age. According to the *śāstra,* in Kali-yuga the Lord would assume a golden or yellow color and would distribute love of Kṛṣṇa and the *saṅkīrtana* movement. In accordance with the *śāstra* and saintly persons, these characteristics were vividly displayed by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and it was therefore clear that Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was an incarnation of Kṛṣṇa. He was confirmed by the *śāstras,* and His characteristics were accepted by saintly people. Since Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu could not escape Sanātana Gosvāmī’s argument, He remained silent on this point and thereby indirectly accepted Sanātana’s statement. By this we can clearly understand that Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was the direct incarnation of Lord Kṛṣṇa.

The comparison made here is very interesting. Kṛṣṇa does not grow like an ordinary human being, even though He exhibits His pastimes of childhood, boyhood and pre-youth. When He reaches the age of pre-youth, *kaiśora,* He does not grow any older. He simply remains in His *kaiśora* age. He is therefore described in the *Brahma-saṁhitā* (5.33) as *nava-yauvana:*

*advaitam acyutam anādim ananta-rūpam *
 *ādyaṁ purāṇa-puruṣaṁ nava-yauvanaṁ ca  
vedeṣu durlabham adurlabham ātma-bhaktau *
 *govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi*

This *nava-yauvana,* or pre-youth, is the eternal transcendental form of Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa never grows older than *nava-yauvana.*

### Translation

**“The eternal pastimes of Kṛṣṇa are continuously taking place in the original Goloka Vṛndāvana planet. These same pastimes are gradually manifested within the material world, in each and every brahmāṇḍa.**

### Purport

Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura elucidates this complicated explanation of Kṛṣṇa’s pastimes. Kṛṣṇa’s pastimes are always present in the material world in one of the many universes. These pastimes appear in the universes one after the other, just as the sun moves across the sky and measures the time. Kṛṣṇa’s appearance may be manifested in this universe at one moment, and immediately after His birth, this pastime is manifested in the next universe. After His killing of Pūtanā is manifested in this universe, it is next manifested in another universe. Thus all the pastimes of Kṛṣṇa are eternally existing both in the original Goloka Vṛndāvana planet and in the material universes. The 125 years calculated in our solar system to be Kṛṣṇa’s lifetime equal one moment for Kṛṣṇa. One moment these pastimes are manifested in one universe, and the next moment they are manifested in the next universe. There are unlimited universes, and Kṛṣṇa’s pastimes are manifested one moment after the other in all of them. This rotation is explained through the example of the sun’s moving across the sky. Kṛṣṇa appears and disappears in innumerable universes, just as the sun appears and disappears during the day. Although the sun appears to rise and set, it is continuously shining somewhere on the earth. Similarly, although Kṛṣṇa’s pastimes seem to appear and disappear, they are continuously existing in one *brahmāṇḍa* (universe) or another. Thus all of Kṛṣṇa’s *līlās* are present simultaneously throughout the innumerable universes. By our limited senses we cannot appreciate this; therefore Kṛṣṇa’s eternal pastimes are very difficult for us to understand. One should try to understand how they are taking place by understanding the example of the sun. Although the Lord is appearing constantly in the material universes, His pastimes are eternally present in the original Goloka Vṛndāvana. Therefore these pastimes are called *nitya-līlā* (eternally present pastimes). Because we cannot see what is going on in other universes, it is a little difficult for us to understand how Kṛṣṇa is eternally manifesting His pastimes. There are fourteen Manus in one day of Brahmā, and this time calculation is also taking place in other universes. Kṛṣṇa’s pastimes are manifested before fourteen Manus expire. Although it is a little difficult to understand the eternal pastimes of Kṛṣṇa in this way, we must accept the verdict of the Vedic literatures.

There are two types of devotees — the *sādhaka,* who is preparing for perfection, and the *siddha,* who is already perfect. As far as those who are already perfect are concerned, Lord Kṛṣṇa says in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (4.9), *tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti so ’rjuna:* “After giving up this material body, such a devotee comes to Me.” After leaving the material body, the perfect devotee takes birth from the womb of a *gopī* on a planet where Kṛṣṇa’s pastimes are going on. This may be in this universe or another universe. This statement is found in the *Ujjvala-nīlamaṇi,* which is commented upon by Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura. When a devotee becomes perfect, he is transferred to a universe where Kṛṣṇa’s pastimes are taking place. Kṛṣṇa’s eternal associates go wherever Kṛṣṇa manifests His pastimes. As stated before, first the father and mother of Kṛṣṇa appear, then the other associates. Quitting his material body, the perfect devotee also goes to associate with Kṛṣṇa and His other associates.
