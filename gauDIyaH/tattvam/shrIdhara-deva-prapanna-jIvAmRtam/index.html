  <meta property="og:description" content="Sri Sri Prapanna-jivanamrtam The Complete Unabridged English Edition - Life-Nectar of the Surrendered Souls Positive and Progressive Immortality by the Intimate Servitor of the Illustrious Universal Preceptor of Vaisnava Thought, Vaisnava-siddhantacarya-samrat Jagad-guru Prabhupada Sri Srimad Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Goswami Maharaja: Om Visnupada Paramahamsa Parivrajakacarya-varya Sarva-sastra-siddhanta-vit Astottara-sata- Sri Srimad Bhakti Raksaka Sridhara Deva Goswami Maharaja Published by the Appointed President-Acarya Parivrajakacarya Srimad Bhakti Sundara Govinda Maharaja Rendered into English by Tridandiswami Sripada Bhakti Ananda Sagara Maharaja Preface (translated from the Publisher’s Note of the first Bengali edition) The best introduction to the author of this book is given by the work itself. Pujyapada Parivrajakacarya Tridandiswami Srimad Bhakti Raksaka Sridhara Maharaja is the fit recipient of the grace bestowed upon him by that great Universal Guru who shines like the sun among the Gaudiya Acaryas: Om Visnupada Sri Srimad Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Goswami Prabhupada. Srila Prabhupada, now left this world to join the eternal divine pastimes, is the Divine Agent to flood the world with the nectarine universal preaching of the glory of the Supreme Lord, in the Divine Succession of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Although the devotional community is well-acquainted with the illustrious personality of His Holiness B.R. Sridhara Maharaja, I may nonetheless take the opportunity to enumerate some of his glories herein for my self- purification. The brilliance of his unprecedented scholarship is found in the artful compilation and harmony of Sri Prapanna-jivanamrtam, Life Nectar of the Surrendered Souls, accurately drawn from the axiomatic teachings of pure devotion (bhakti-siddhanta-vani) as evolved by the Vaisnava preceptors in the line of the bona fide Scriptures. We have already seen the extraordinary competence of His Holiness in preaching the beautiful, illuminating conceptions of the kings of transcendental scholars - the Vaisnava Preceptors headed by Sri Rupa, Sri Sanatana, and Sri Jiva - in various languages throughout the whole of India. Upon reading the first Sanskrit poem composed by His Holiness, Sri Bhaktivinoda Viraha Dasakam, our Divine Master commented that the writing was of a happy style. Srila Prabhupada profusely praised the devotional gravity of the presentation, revealing his deep satisfaction and joyful confidence that in times to come the message of Sri Caitanyadeva would be befittingly upheld and preached by the author. Just prior to his entrance into his eternal pastimes, Srila Prabhupada, in preference to hearing devotional prayer (kirtana) performed by devotees recognized for expertise, called for His Holiness’ pure rendering of Sri Rupa-manjari pada, sei mora sampada, the worshipful prayer of the Gaudiya Vaisnavas’ most cherished ideal. The theme of Life-Nectar of the Surrendered Souls is described in the introductory first chapter, Prelude to Approaching Nectar. In some instances throughout the work, the Bengali verse interpretation of the venerated pure devotees has been fittingly given for the translation of the authentic stanzas quoted. In Words of Nectar from the Devotees, statements of the Supreme Lord have occasionally been quoted in conformation with the development of the theme. In his explanatory aphorisms that precede each stanza, the author reveals the unique axiomatic truths (siddhanta) of his Divine Succession. Doubtlessly, the good readers who know the supereminence of the Gaudiya- siddhanta - the axiomatic devotional teachings in the line of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu - will be overjoyed with His Holiness’ novel illuminations. In the epilogue, the author has mentioned his line of Divine Succession and the time and place of the writing of the book. It has been vividly illustrated herein that a life without surrender unto the lotus feet of Sri Krsna is utterly futile, and the most treasured perfection achieved through exclusive surrender has been revealed. This will especially encourage those who are aspiring to enter the land of devotion, drawing them onward to the lotus feet of Sri Hari. And it will infuse spiritual joy and exhilaration in the hearts of the established devotees. This book is the supreme wealth of the surrendered souls. Devotion for the Supreme Lord, Sri Hari-bhakti, is the singular quintessence in this world, and only by exclusive surrender, saranagati, is it happily attained. May this Life-Nectar of the Surrendered Souls graciously appear all the world over, distributing the ever-increasing aspiration to reach the abode of divine ecstasy - the lotus feet of Sri Hari. Just as the repeated rubbing of sandalwood produces more and more charming fragrance, we remain confident that the faithful devotees, whose only pleasure is in conclusive theological truth (sat-siddhanta), will experience the ambrosial devotional fragrance of this holy treatise in their spiritual discussions, and thus relish transcendental delight. We shall consider ourselves blessed when this book inevitably comes to be treasured by the august assembly of the fortunate souls. a Vaisnava’s servant’s servant, Sri Nrsimhananda Brahmacari on the holy anniversary of Srila Bhakti Siddhanta Prabhupada’s departure, Gaurabda 457 (14th January, 1944) at Sri Dhama Navadvipa All glory to the Divine Master and the Supreme Lord Sri Krsna Caitanya Publisher’s Note Sri Sri Prapanna-jivanamrtam, The Life-nectar of the Surrendered Souls, is the crown-jewel of divine literatures as the eternal elixir of life for the exclusively surrendered souls, the bestower of the perpetual relish of full-fledged nectar, and the awakening and sustaining fountainhead of life in Divine Consorthood. Indeed, who can fittingly portray her holy glory and renown? In the same way we cannot but feel ever inadequate when we attempt to sing the glories of the illustrious author, our most worshipful Divine Master, Om Visnupada Sri Srila Bhakti Raksaka Sridhara Deva Goswami Maharaja, the dearmost intimate attendant of the great pioneer pre-eminent among the Gaudiya Acaryas, Sri Gauranga’s transcendental message incarnate - Prabhupada Sri Srila Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Goswami Thakura. Even without world itineracy, the seat of Universal Guru (Jagad-guru) of the world’s renowned gurus has been gracefully won by Srila Sridhara Deva Goswami Maharaja while presiding in the grand, noble distinction of his venerable years of devotional life at the Sri Chaitanya Saraswat Math of Nabadwip, his exclusive, personal holy place of bhajana. Since its first printing, which was in Bengali, this sublime literature has brought heartfelt satisfaction to the stalwart devotees of the highest order, being hailed by them as an Essential Scripture to be unfailingly sung and cultivated as a daily devotional function in spiritual life, as is customarily practiced with the Holy Scriptures such as the Srimad Bhagavad-gita. In both the Eastern and Western countries, its English publication will doubtlessly be similarly worshiped with the utmost reverence, constantly studied and sung with devotion by the surrendered souls of fine theistic intellect, and by the noble souls engaged in their divine search for the Supreme Lord. This monumental work was originally composed in the Sanskrit language. The authentic Bengali translation that was sanctioned by the author is extremely developed, profoundly exploring the heart of the book; scholars who know the internal conclusive scriptural purports can alone realize how difficult is its translation and publication into English. However, by the boundless mercy of the most magnanimous Supreme Lord Sri Caitanyacandra, the fountainhead of all incarnations of Godhead, and by the causeless grace of His most beloved, our Divine Master, and the pure devotees whose hearts are absorbed in divine love - this formidable task has now been fulfilled. Thus, I again and again worship the holy lotus feet of Them all. For their tireless efforts to usher in the Advent of the present edition in its perfectly elegant form, all those Godbrothers and Godsisters who served in the various facets of the publication have attained the unending graces of our Divine Master and the Vaisnavas. They have bound us in eternal gratitude. For executing the task of the English translation, proofing, and editing, special mention is due to Tridandiswami Sripada Bhakti Ananda Sagara Maharaja, assisted by Sriman Nimaisundara Brahmacari Vidyavinoda. And for their dedicated effort in securing the necessary funds and assistance for the printing and publishing of the work in a most dignified presentation, special mention is due to Sripada Dayadhara Gauranga Dasa Brahmacari Bhakti Prabhakara Prabhu and all the good devotees assisting him. In conclusion, invoking the charming verse of Sri Gurupadapadma this humble servant earnestly prays at his holy lotus feet that this crownjewel of Sacred Writings, Sri Sri Prapanna-jivanamrtam, may remain with Her merciful presence in every land, in every home, and in every heart. And in Her gracious acquiescence, may She acknowledge the glorious victory of Her goodwill by churning and overflooding the entire living universe with Her supramundane wave of ecstatic love, to bless all souls with the supreme good fortune. sri-srimad-bhagavat-padambuja-madhu-svadotsavaih sat-padair niksipta madhu-bindavas ca parito bhrasta mukhat gunjitaih yatnaih kincid ihahrtam nija-parasreyo ‘rthina tan maya bhuyobhuya ito rajamsi pada-samlagnani tesam bhaje “The bees, intoxicated in the festival of drinking the honey of the Lord’s lotus feet, busily humming the glories of the Lord, drops of honey from their mouths fall and scatter all around; for my divine prospect, I’ve carefully collected some of those drops herein - and thus do I worship the dust of the holy lotus feet of those saints, again and again.” I beg to remain most humbly, Tridandi-bhiksu Sri Bhakti Sundara Govinda 16 October, 1987 93rd Holy Appearance Day of His Divine Grace Srila Bhakti Raksaka Sridhara Deva Goswami Maharaja This Divine Book was prepared and presented to the Lotus Hands of the Venerable Author by his disciples and aspiring servitors on the celebrated appearance day of Lord Gauracandra, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, March 3, 1988 All glory to the Divine Master and the Supreme Lord Sri Krsna Caitanya Foreword Because the soul is a particle of consciousness, it is endowed with free will. Eliminating free will, only gross matter remains. Without independence, the soul could not progress from bondage to liberation, and his ultimate salvation would have been impossible. But his spirit of exploitation is a foreign force, an intoxicant - a miscalculation that surrounds his independence. Life’s objectives may be scientifically analyzed as threefold: exploitation, renunciation, and dedication. The most common tendency is in those engaged in exploiting other persons, species, or elements, for mundane sense enjoyment. They desire to materially elevate themselves in the present environment, and thus they are described as elevationists. A more sober class discover the severe equal and opposite reactions to worldly pursuits, and they engage in renunciation of the world, in search of an equilibrium comparable to a deep, dreamless slumber. By being unawake to the world, they hope to escape its concomitant reactions and sufferings. Thus their goal is liberation, and they are known as salvationists or liberationists. But through the correct interpretation of the Revealed Scriptures by learned votaries such as Sri Sanatana Goswami, Sri Jiva Goswami, and Sri Ramanuja, the devotees of divinity know the pursuits of both exploitation and renunciation as not only fruitless, but injurious to real progress. The normal, wholesome, and happy plane is in the life of dedication. Without exploiting or borrowing anything from the environment, and without attempting to artificially renounce it, one who is sincere to dedicate himself naturally comes into contact with a higher and more subtle plane of life. By his readiness to give and serve, he will attain to a higher society and achieve an appropriate master. The enjoying spirit forces one to be associated with a lower section to control and enjoy. And the renouncing spirit allures even the scholars with its ‘prestigious’ superiority over exploitation. Thus it is more dangerous, just as a half-truth is more dangerous than falsehood. As it is difficult to awaken someone from the deepest possible sleep, the liberationists may remain for incalculable time within their cell of non-differentiated liberation. But the higher existence will invite the service of one who desires to purely dedicate himself without remuneration. Seva - service, dedication, is the summum bonum of the teachings of the Vaisnava school, the third plane of life where every unit is a dedicating member in an organic whole. In such a normal adjustment, everyone mutually assists one another in their service to the center, the higher recipient, the highest entity. Everything is existing to satisfy Him, because He must possess this qualification to be the Absolute. He is the prime cause of all causes - and everything exists for Him, to satisfy Him. A barren conception of mere ‘deathlessness’ cannot afford us any knowledge of a positive thing, but only freedom from the negative side. If immortality means ’no influence of mortality,’ what, then, is its positive conception? What will be the nature, movement, and progress of that which is immortal? Without this understanding immortality is only an abstract idea. Because it does not appear to exhibit the symptoms of death, stone would be ‘more immortal’ than human beings, and conscious entities would be ‘mortal,’ forever denied immortality! What, then, is the positive conception of immortality? How are the immortal ‘immortal’? What is the positive reality in immortality? How can one become immortal? One must search out his intrinsic location in the universal order. It will not do to attempt to solve only the negative side of life which is full of suffering - birth, death, infirmity, and disease. We should know that there exists a conception of life worth living for. This positive side has been almost totally neglected in general religious views. The ‘immortality’ professed by the schools of Buddha and Sankaracarya yields no positive life. Their goals are maha-nirvana and brahma-sayujya respectively. The Buddhist theory is that after liberation, nothing remains. They crave absolute extinction of material existence (prakrti-nirvana). And the Sankarite monist theory of liberation is to lose one’s individuality by ‘becoming one’ with the non-differentiated aspect of the Absolute. That is, they crave extinction in Brahman (brahma- nirvana). They postulate that when the triad of seer, seen, and seeing (drasta-drsya-darsana), or knower, knowable, and knowledge (jnata- jneya-jnana) culminate at one point, the triad is destroyed (triputi- vinasa) and nothing remains. Material action and reaction ceases in Viraja, the river of passivity, which is located at the uppermost edge of this illusory (mayika) world. And above Viraja is the destination of the Sankarites - the ‘abscissa’ stage or the non-differentiated plane of Brahman, called Brahmaloka, which is located at the lowest edge of the spiritual realm. Both are vague areas of ,negative immortality.’ Brahmaloka is a marginal or ‘buffer’ state midway between the material and spiritual worlds. Composed of innumerable souls, it is an immortal plane devoid of specific variegatedness (nirvisesa). It possesses positivity only in the sense that it is a plane of existence, a background (kastha), but in itself it lacks positive development of variegated existence (kala). The nature of the background is oneness, and development woven over it necessitates plurality or a differentiated nature (kala-kasthadi rupena parinama- pradayini - Candi, Markandeya Purana). In the Bhagavad-gita (15.16), mutable (ksara) and immutable (aksara) existences are described, representing the personal and the impersonal, the development and the basis, or differentiated and non- differentiated conceptions of general existence. The mutable is represented by the multitude of embodied living beings, while the immutable aspect is the great expanse of the all-accommodating Absolute, the Brahman (8.3). In the analysis of worldly action, the most subtle form of unfructified past action, prior to the present tendency (the seedling stage) to sin, has been defined (Bhakti-rasamrita-sindhu, Purva 1.23) as unknowable, indistinct, and of untraceable origin (kuta). The immutable Brahman aspect of the Absolute is similarly defined as being one-dimensional - undetectable, unspecific, and of no definite color, sound, or taste; an unknown and unknowable ‘un-understandable’ stage of existence (kuta). But the Supreme Lord, Krsna, is above both the mutable and immutable existences, and thus His glories are sung throughout the Vedas and in the world as the Purusottama, the Supreme Personality (Bhagavad-gita, 15.18). Sri Sukadeva Goswami affirms that in the most remote and distant plane, Lord Krsna is to be found: everywhere is He - the fountainhead of all conceptions (vidura-kasthaya, Bhagavatam, 2.4.14). He cannot be eliminated. Thus, the ‘immortality’ of the impersonalistic schools such as Buddhists, Sankarites, etc., offers no positive life. But in Vaisnavism, immortality is positive, dynamic existence. Above the non-differentiated Brahman aspect of the Absolute, the transcendental, variegated existence begins in the first glimpse of the spiritual sky, the plane known as Paravyoma (Chaitanya-charitamrita, Madhya 19.153). Situated there in the spiritual plane is the positive Kingdom of God: firstly Vaikuntha, then Ayodhya, Dvaraka, Mathura, and finally, above all, Goloka. Transcending the vague areas of ’negative immortality’ that the impersonalists aspire for, the devotees - the Vaisnavas - dedicate themselves to the life of eternal devotional service to the Supreme Lord of the transcendental realm (Bhagavad-gita, 18.54). Although the soul can maladopt himself to a fallen state of existence in the planes of exploitation and renunciation, he is inherently adoptable to the positive life in the Kingdom of God. And fully blossomed, he reaches the realm of Goloka (svarupe sabara haya golokete sthiti - Sri Sri Krsnera Astottara-sata-nama). Sri Prapanna-jivanamrtam: amrta means ‘undying,’ or ’nectar,’ and jivana means ’life.’ Positive immortality is possible only for the surrendered (prapannanam). All others are necessarily mortal. Only those who have wholly given themselves to the center are living in eternality. Surrender is fully established in its excellence and its constant position. Yet there is variegatedness within that constancy, in the form of progressive movement, or pastimes (vilasa). The Supreme Absolute Personality being infinitely superior to both the mutable “mortals’ and the immutable “immortal’ (negative) Brahman, only the svarupa-siddha souls - those who are perfectly established in their divine relationship with Him - are eternally freed from the disease of mutation and mortality ( svarupena-vyavasthitih Bhagavatam, 2. 10.6). With a broad vision, we must know ourselves as created of smaller stuff, and thus only with assistance from above can we improve our situation and achieve a position in the higher plane. A submissive, serving attitude is necessary in us. If we submit, the universal dictatorial aspect of the Absolute will take us upward to a higher prospect. He is the autocrat, the absolute knowledge, the absolute good - everything about Him is absolute. Being in a vulnerable position as we experience in this world, why, then, should we not submit to Him? The road to the sphere of transcendence (adhoksaja) is the deductive or descending method (avaroha-pantha). We can reach the absolute good, the absolute will, by His consent alone. Only by faith in absolute surrender is anyone allowed entry into that domain, never by ,exploration,’ by,colonization,’ or by attempting to become a,monarch’ there. No inductive or ascending method (aroha-pantha) such as renunciation or yoga, etc., can compel Him to accept us. Whosoever He chooses can alone reach Him (Svetasvataropanisad, 6.23). Although the highest point of the renunciates is desirelessness or freedom from possessiveness, the surrendered soul (saranagata) is naturally desireless ( akincana, Chaitanya-charitamrita, Madhya 22.99). Detachment is only the negative side of surrender, and above selflessness, the devotee surrenders himself to the higher substance, and this is to be awake in another world, another plane of life. Such is the positive, Vaisnavaconception of life - to determine one’s real self beyond the jurisdiction of the world of misconception. The nature of the progressive substance is eternal existence, knowledge, and beauty (sac-cid-ananda). The one harmonizing organic whole (advaya-jnana-tattva) contains all similarities and differences, held inconceivably in the hand of the Absolute (acintya-bhedabheda- tattva). And there is no anarchy in the absolute power. Nonetheless, mercy is found to be above justice. Above judiciousness, the supreme position is held by love, sympathy, and beauty: ‘I am the absolute power, but I am friendly to you all. Knowing this, you need never fear (Bhagavad-gita, 5.29).’ This revelation relieves us of all apprehension: we are not victims of a chaotic environment, but it is judicious, considerate - and the ultimate dispenser is our friend. Sri Jiva Goswami has stated that of the six symptoms of surrender, to embrace the guardianship of the Lord (goptrtve varanam) is central, since total surrender expresses the same ideal. The remaining five symptoms of accepting the favorable, rejecting the unfavorable, faith in the Lord’s protection, full self-surrender, and humility, are natural contributing associate-servitors to the ideal (angangi-bhedena sad-vidha; tatra ‘goptrtve varanam’ evangi, saranagati-sabdenaikarthyat; anyani tv angani tat parikaratvat - Bhakti-sandarbha, 236). Surrender is the foundation of the world of devotion. It is the very life and essence. One cannot enter into that domain without surrender. It must be present in every form of service, and to attempt divine service without it will be mere imitation or a lifeless formality. The entire gist of the Vedic instruction is to dedicate oneself to the service of the Lord. In his commentary of Srimad-Bhagavatam, Sri Sridhara Swamipada has stated that only if the practices of devotion are initially offered to the Supreme Lord can they be recognized as devotion. To attempt to execute them and subsequently offer them cannot be pure devotion (iti nava laksanani yasyah sa, adhitena ced bhagavati visnau bhaktih kriyate, sa carpitaiva sati yadi kriyeta, na tu krta sati pascad arpyeta) Without surrender, the activity will be adulterated with exploitation, renunciation, artificial meditation (karma, jnana,yoga), and so on. By constitution, the soul is the Lord’s servant, and the Lord has the right to make or mar, to do anything according to His sweet will. If accepting this truth we undertake the devotional practices such as hearing, chanting, remembering, and worshipping, only then will our activity be devotional. Only the activity of the self-dedicated soul can be devotion. Sincere prayer will help us to seek the help of the Lord, but, again, prayer in the spirit of surrender can alone reach Him (Saranagati, 1.5). The path of devotion entails increasing our negative status to invite the positive to descend and embrace us: ‘I am very low, and You are so high. You can purify me, take me and utilize me for Your higher purpose. Be pleased. Otherwise I am helpless, neglected.’ It is impossible to take Him captive in the cage of our knowledge. Only the way of devotion can help us. In every respect He is high, great, and infinite - and we are similarly small. His mercy - His sympathy, love, and grace, are the only medium through which we can come together. And good faith is autonomous in that sweet land which is so high that we will earnestly hope and pray for the association of the higher existence as His slave; and that also will be our happy prospect for the future. Krsna is not within our purview, and thus we are always recommended by Scriptures and saints to approach the bona fide Divine Master and Vaisnavas. To satisfy the Supreme Lord, the criterion is to satisfy our Gurudeva: if Gurudeva is dissatisfied with us, the Lord is surely dissatisfied. An analogy has been cited in the Scriptures where the Lord is compared to the sun, the Guru to a pond, and the disciple to a lotus flower. If the pond withdraws, the very sun will scorch and dry up the lotus - and the lotus will be cheered by the sun as long as the water supports and surrounds it. Yasya prasadad bhagavat prasado, yasyaprasadan na gatih kuto ‘pi, dhyayam stavams tasya yasas tri- sandhyam, vande guroh sri-caranaravindam (Gurvastakam, 8): ‘I bow down to the lotus feet of Sri Gurudeva. By his grace we achieve the grace of Krsna; without his grace, we are lost. Therefore, at daybreak, noon, and evening, we meditate upon and sing the glories of Sri Gurudeva, and pray for his mercy.’ The Vaisnava Guru’s dealings with the disciple are all grace, and his grace is his will to extend his wealth to the disciple. His instruction is the medium of asserting his will, which is service for the satisfaction of the Lord. And by service, we invite his grace. By an earnest desire to serve, we draw his sympathy and his willing extension of goodwill to encourage us in our relationship with the supreme entity. Firstly, surrender: we must offer him exclusive respect (pranipata), otherwise we shall not allow ourselves to approach him. Secondly, we may make our sincere and substantial inquiry (pariprasna). In a surrendered spirit, we may hear our Divine Master’s messages which he delivers to us from his venerated seat, the Vyasasana. In that conducive setting, the proper inspiration and dictation may fortuitously come down to us. And finally, to render service (sevaya) enables us to taste the essence (Bhagavad-gita, 4.34). On the instruction of his Gurudeva Devarsi Narada, Vyasadeva had to undergo a progressive development (Bhagavatam, 1.5). Narada is established in non-calculative devotion (jnana-sunya-bhakti, or jnana- vimukta-bhakti-paramah ), and above Narada is Uddhava, who is established in exclusive divine love for Krsna (premaika-nisthah). Until one reaches Goloka, where there is full-fledged Krsna conception, all other stages may be changeable. There is no further change when one is firmly established in his serving relationship with the Original Lord (svayam-bhagavan), Krsna. In the narrative of Brhad-Bhagavatamrtam, Gopakumara passes through Vaikuntha, Ayodhya, Mathura, Dvaraka, and then he finally arrives in Vrndavana. There, his particular divine relationship with the Lord firmly culminates in friendship (sakhya-rasa). For him, the previous stages were passing, although for others a permanent relationship may occur in one of them. They are progressive stages of,positive immortality.’ On the banks of the Godavari river, in progressively deeper and deeper planes, the entirety of theological development was expressed in the conversation between Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu and Sri Ramananda Raya. A positive hierarchy of divine relationships with the Lord exists in progressive stages for the various types of devotees ( karmibhyah … kah krti, Upadesamritam, 10), each type having its characteristic central relationship (vaikunthaj … viveki na kah, Upadesamritam, 9). In the divine realm, the depth and degree of surrender may also be measured according to the science of mellows (rasa-tattva): peacefulness, servitorship, friendship, parenthood, and consorthood (santa-, dasya-, sakhya-, vatsalya-and madhura-rasa) are the natural divisions, each consecutively of a finer layer. And higher than even the direct consorthood of the Godhead is the most elevated of the entire compass of devotional services - the divine service of the Supreme Predominated Moiety (Sri Radha-dasya). According to the intensity of surrender - to the point of no return - the quality of the magnitude of truth encountered may be measured. The inner sweetness of the truth and its infinite characteristic attracts the devotees’ hearts to the highest degree, so much that they never feel any satisfaction of achievement in what is actually the acme of their highest fortune. In Vaikuntha, only peacefulness and servitorship are present, with a hint of friendship. If we commit the offense of giving more attention to law than to love, we will be ‘cast down’ from Goloka to Vaikuntha: Goloka is the land of love, and there the inhabitants know nothing more. And by love is meant self-sacrifice and self-forgetfulness for the service of Krsna, without a care for one’s good or bad future - total risk in the extreme. In his Bhakti-sandarbha, Sri Jiva Goswami defines ‘Bhagavan,’ the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as more than ‘Lord Narayana of Vaikuntha, the most powerful in all phases.’ Above that, His existence, appearance, and nature attracts everyone to serve Him, love Him, and die for Him (bhajaniya-guna-visista). His qualification is so beautiful. Thus, the highest conception of the Godhead is the Krsna conception, and He can be known by the devotees in Krsna consciousness. Those who serve and worship the Supreme Lord according to the scriptural regulation and calculation belong to the category of Vaikuntha worship. In Vaikuntha, in the initial transcendental conscious conception (adhoksaja), the Godhead as Lord Narayana accepts reverential service in His Majestic Dignity. But the devotees of the highest order are exclusively surrendered to the service of Lord Krsna with their innermost love and faith. The Krsna conception of Goloka Vrndavana is corroborated in the Srimad Bhagavatam, which is the greatest interpretation of the Vedic Scriptures. And Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu is known to be Krsna Himself, united with His highest potency, Sri Radha. Mahaprabhu Sri Caitanyadeva has clearly revealed that the genuine interpretation and purpose of all the Revealed Scriptures is to faithfully guide us to the highest goal: the domain of love and unconditional surrender unto the central power of truth, personified in Lord Krsna as beauty and affection. Not power, but affection is the highest force to attract us all. Consciously or unconsciously, the absolute position is held by love and affection, and love is superior to all power and knowledge. It is the real fulfillment of the inner heart. Our inner existence wants only love, beauty, and affection - neither knowledge nor power. The finite cannot capture the infinite, but the infinite can make Himself known to the finite. And when the infinite appears as a member of the finite land, the highest gain of the finite is achieved. Krsna carries His father’s shoes, and He cries when chastised by His mother. Through love, the Absolute comes down to the finite. The infinite’s most intimate approach to the finite is found in Vrndavana. The infinite comes to embrace the finite in its fullest capacity (aprakrta), mixing with finite things so closely that people cannot perceive the Lord’s transcendental Godly character as the Divinity. We, the infinitesimal souls, can attain our greatest fortune when the infinite comes to us in His highest approach - as if He were one of us! His approach is so merciful, so great, so intimate, and so perfect. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, who is sweetness and magnanimity combined, openly announced that we are all natural slaves of the highest entity (Chaitanya-charitamrita, Madhya 20.108). But this is slavery to the great force of love and beauty. It is the greatest fortune to be utilized in any way by the absolute existence, knowledge, and beauty - to be in harmony with the highest center. No one is forced or barred but this is the soul’s intrinsic nature. Faithfully in the Divine Succession from Nitya-lila-pravista Om Visnupada Paramahamsa Astottara-sata Sri Srimad Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Goswami Prabhupada, especially inspired by the divine message of Srila Thakura Bhaktivinoda’s Saranagati, and attending the authentic Gaudiya Vaisnava literatures such as Sri Hari-bhakti-vilasa and Bhakti-sandarbha as well as the writings of other Authorized Divine Successions such as the Ramanuja Sampradaya - this Sri Sri Prapanna- jivanamrtam has been compiled in order to supply the devotees’ spiritual sustenance and nourishment. Surrender is the indispensable necessity in the life of a devotee, and Life-Nectar of the Surrendered Souls will sustain and fortify the surrendered souls as the nectar in their lives of Positive and Progressive Immortality. 1.1 Chapter 1 Upakramamrtam - Prelude to Approaching Nectar atha mangalacaranam - sri-guru-gaura-gandharva-, govindanghrin ganaih saha vande prasadato yesam, sarvarambhah subhankarah Auspicious invocation - I make my obeisance unto the lotus feet of my Divine Master, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, Sri Sri Gandharva-Giridhari (Sri Sri Radha and Krsna), and Their associates. By Their grace, all endeavors are successful. 1.2 gaura-vag-vigraham vande, gaurangam gaura-vaibhavam gaura-sankirtanonmattam, gaura-karunya-sundaram I make my obeisance unto the Deity, Gaura-Saraswati - the personified message of the Golden Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu - whose bodily luster is of a beautiful golden hue, like that of the selfsame Lord Gaurasundara; who is the personal expansion of that Supreme Lord Gaurahari; who is always intoxicated by preaching the message of that Golden Lord; and whose divine beauty blooms in the revelation of Lord Gauranga’s mercy potency. (This is the fundamental meaning of the verse. Within the scope of the Sanskrit language, various expanded purports may be drawn from the original.) 1.3 guru-rupa-harim gauram, radha-ruci-rucavrtam nityam naumi navadvipe, nama-kirtana-nartanaih Perpetually do I sing the glories of Lord Gauranga, who is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Sri Hari, embraced by the heart and halo of Sri Radhika, and who has descended as the Divine Master. In this holy abode of Sri Navadvipa Dhama, He is absorbed in the pastimes of profusely chanting the holy names, dancing in ecstasy. (As with verse two, expanded purports may be drawn from this verse.) 1.4 srimat-prabhu-padambhoja-, madhupebhyo namo namah trpyantu krpaya te ’tra, prapanna-jivanamrte Again and again I make my obeisance unto the eternal personal servitors of my Divine Master, who drink the nectar of his lotus feet. I pray they may be graciously pleased in tasting this Life-Nectar of the Surrendered Souls. 1.5 atma-vijnaptih - aty-arvacina-rupo ‘pi, pracinanam susammatan slokan katipayan atra, caharami satam mude A humble petition - Despite my disqualifications, for the satisfaction of the pure devotees I have compiled in this book an anthology of stanzas that are well established by our predecessors. 1.6 tad-vag-visargo janatagha-viplavo yasmin prati-slokam abaddhavaty api namany anantasya yaso ’nkitani yat srnvanti gayanti grnanti sadhavah “Even if every stanza is imperfectly composed, that is, unlucidly expressed, the sins of the people are totally vanquished by those expressions or books in which the glorious holy names of the Infinite Supreme Lord are described - since the pure devotees hear those holy names (from a qualified preacher), they solitarily sing those holy names (even in the absence of others), and they chant the unending glories of those holy names (in the presence of a deserving listener).” 1.7 abhivyakta mattah prakrti-laghu-rupad api budha vidhatri siddharthan hari-gunamayi vah krtir iyam pulindenapy agnih kim u samidham unmathya janito hiranya-sreninam apaharati nantah kalusatam “O learned personalities, this treatise, composed of the divine qualities of Lord Hari, will fulfill your cherished wishes despite the fact that it is presented by me, a very insignificant person. Does not the fire ignited from pieces of wood rubbed together by a low-born barbarian dissipate the impurities in gold?” 1.8 yathokta rupa-padena, nicenotpadite ’nale hemnah suddhis tathaivatra, viraharti-hrtih satam As Srila Rupa Goswamipada has (in his humility) expressed that gold can be purified with fire lit by a barbarian, similarly, the pure devotees’ grief born of their separation from the Lord may also be dispelled by this book (which will light the lamp of their divine love for the Lord). 1.9 antah kovi-yasas-kamam, sadhutavaranam bahih sudhyantu sadhavah sarve, duscikitsyam imam janam O saintly devotees, please purify this wrongdoer who on the pretext of saintliness desires in his heart the prestige of a poet, and who is thus afflicted with the practically incurable disease of insincerity. 1.10 krsna-gatha-priya bhakta, bhakta-gatha-priyo harih kathancid ubhayor atra, prasangas tat prasidatam Tidings of Lord Krsna are naturally very dear to the devotees, and tidings of the Lord’s devotees are also dear to Him. Since narratives of both the Supreme Lord and His devotees can be found within this book, I have hope, O pure devotees, that you may be propitiated hereby. 1.11 svabhava-krpaya santo, mad uddesya-malinatam samsodhyang ikurudhvam bho, hy ahaituka krpabdhayah O pure devotees, by your natural divine grace, kindly purify me of ill motives (offenses) and accept this treatise. Certainly you will do so, because you are the ocean of causeless mercy. 1.12-14 atha grantha-paricayah - granthe ‘smin parame nama, prapanna-jivanamrte dasadhyaye prapannanam, jivana-prana-dayakam varddhakam posakam nityam, hrdindriya-rasayanam atimartya-rasollasa-, paraspara-sukhavaham viraha-milanarthaptam, krsna-karsna-kathamrtam prapatti-visayam vakyam, coddhrtam sastra-sammatam Introduction to the book - The substance expressed within the ten chapters of this holy book called Prapanna-jivanamrtam gives life to the surrendered souls, effecting their eternal growth and nourishment. It is the panacea of the heart and spiritual senses, bestowing those dedicated devotees’ mutual happiness by the ever-increasingly newer and newer play of supramundane joy (aprakrta-rasa). Lord Krsna and His associates are portrayed in their natural pastimes of separation and union, and the line of unconditional surrender as established by Scriptures and saints has been elucidated. 1.15-22 atra cananya-cittanam, krsna-pada-rajojusam krsna-pada-prapannanam, krsnarthe ‘khila-karmanam krsna-premaika-lubdhanam, krsnocchistaika jivinam krsna-sukhaika-vanchanam, krsna-kinkara-sevinam krsna-viccheda-dagdhanam, krsna-sangollasadd-hrdam krsna-svajana-bandhunam, krsnaika-dayitatmanam bhaktanam hrdayodghati-, marma-gathamrtena ca bhaktarti-hara-bhaktasa-, bhista-purtikaram tatha sarva-samsaya-cchedi-hrd-, granthi-bhij jnana-bhasitam apurva-rasa-sambhara-, camatkarita-cittakam viraha-vyadhi-santapta-, bhakta-citta-mahausadham yuktayuktam parityajya, bhaktarthakhila-cestitam atma-pradana-paryanta-, pratijnantah-pratisrutam bhakta-premaika-vasya-sva-, svarupollasa-ghositam purnasvasakaram saksat, govinda-vacanamrtam samahrtam pibantu bhoh, sadhavah suddha-darsanah Carefully compiled in this book is the nectar of the deep, heartrevealing transcendental messages of those devotees whose hearts are unalloyed; who are servitors of the dust of the lotus feet of Krsna; who perform their every act for Krsna; who are filled with insatiable desire exclusively in love of Krsna and sustain their lives on Krsna’s remnants alone; who desire only Krsna’s pleasure andserve the servants of Krsna; whose hearts burn in separation of Krsna and overflow with ecstasy in the association of Krsna; whose relative and friend is Krsna; and whose one and only beloved is Krsna. Along with these expressions of the devotees are carefully collected the words of supreme nectar - springing directly from the lotus mouth of Lord Govinda - which vanquish the heartbreak of the devotees; which fulfill the devotee’s hopes and earnest aspirations; which destroy all doubt and sever the knot of ignorance; which are dazzling with transcendental wisdom and astonish the heart by miraculous waves of divine rapture, which are the great panacea for the devotee’s heart afflicted with the piercing pangs of separation; which are incited wholly for the devotee irrespective of his qualification or disqualification, so much so, that the Lord is bound by His pledge to give Himself to His devotee; and which openly proclaim with great ecstasy that His very nature is to be subjugated solely by the affection of His devotee, reassuring His devotees in all circumstances. O pure and spotless devotees, may you drink deeply the quintessence of these divine elixirs. 1.23 adhyaya-paricayah - atraiva prathamadhyaye, upakramamrtabhidhe mangalacaranan catma-, vijnaptir vastu-nirnayah grantha-paricayo ‘dhyaya-, visayas ca nivesitah Chapter summary - An auspicious invocation, a humble petition, an introduction to the book and its chapters, and the theme of the philosophy of the book have, to the best of my ability, all been entered within this first chapter named Upakramamrtam or Prelude to Approaching Nectar. 1.24 dvitiyadhyayake nama, sri-sastra-vacanamrte prapatti-visaya nana-, sastroktih sannivesita In the second chapter, entitled Sri Sastra-vacanamrtam, The Nectar of Scriptural Word, various scriptural quotations regarding surrender to the Supreme Lord have been compiled. 1.25 trtiyato ‘stamam yavat, sri-bhakta-vacanamrte prapattih sad-vidha prokta, bhagavata-ganodita Chapters three to eight inclusive are entitled Sri Bhakta- vacanamrtam, Words of Nectar from the Devotees. Beautifully expressed by the lotus lips of the pure devotees of the Lord, many stanzas describing the six limbs of exclusive surrender are quoted therein. 1.26-27 anakulyasya sankalpah, pratikulya-vivarjanam raksisyatiti visvaso, goptrtve varanam tatha atma-niksepa karpanye, sad-vidha saranagatih evam paryayatas casminn, ekaikadhyaya-sangrahah These six chapters have been compiled, each consecutively dealing with the six limbs of surrender, which are as follows: 1. To accept everything favorable for devotion to Krsna 2. To reject everything unfavorable for devotion to Krsna 3. To be confident that Krsna will grant His protection 4. To embrace Krsna’s guardianship 5. To offer oneself unto Him 6. To consider oneself lowly and bereft 1.28 adhyaye navame nama, bhagavad-vacanamrte slokamrtam samahrtam, saksad-bhagavatoditam In the ninth chapter entitled Sri Bhagavad-vacanamrtam, Words of Nectar from the Supreme Lord, nectarean stanzas emanating directly from the lotus mouth of the Supreme Lord have been compiled. 1.29 dasame caramadhyaye, cavasesamrtabhidhe guru-krsna-smrtau grantha-, syopasamharanam krtam Absorbed in thought of the Divine Master and Lord Sri Krsna, the tenth and final chapter entitled Sri Avasesamrtam, The Divine Remnants of Nectar, was composed as the epilogue of the book. 1.30 uddhrta-sloka-purve tu, tad artha-suprakasakam vakyan ca yatnatas tatra, yatha-jnanam nivesitam Prior to each stanza quoted, an aphorism illuminating its inner purport has been carefully entered according to my best insight. 1.31 bhagavad-gauracandranam, vadanendu-sudhatmika bhaktoktair vesita sloka, bhakta-bhavodita yatah Being revealed by the Lord Himself adopting the heart of a devotee, the stanzas of pure nectar emanating from the moon of Sri Gauracandra have been entered along with the stanzas of the devotees. 1.32 prapattya saha cananya-, bhakter naikatya-hetutah ananya-bhakti-sambandham, bahu-vakyam ihoddhrtam Many expressions of exclusive devotion (ananya-bhakti) have been recorded herein, since exclusive devotion is most intimately related to surrender. 1.33 bhagavad-bhakta-sastranam, sambandho ‘sti parasparam tat tat pradhanyato namnam, prabbeda-karanam smrtam Actually, Words of Nectar from the Supreme Lord, Words of Nectar from the Devotees, and The Nectar of Scriptural Word are all seen to be interrelated. Still, they have been portrayed separately due to their individual importance. 1.34 praty-adhyaya-visesas tu, tatra tatraiva vaksyate mahajana-vicarasya, kincid alocyate ‘dhuna The unique characteristic of each chapter will be accordingly expressed therein. Now (in this respect), we may have some general deliberation, in the line of the great devotees of the Lord. 1.35 vastu-nirnayah - bhagavad-bhaktitah sarvam, ity utsrjya vidher api kainkaryam krsna-padaika-, srayatvam saranagatih Theme of the work - Being governed by the faith that all success is achieved by serving the Supreme Lord, to abandon servitude to even scriptural injunctions and take exclusive refuge in the lotus feet of Sri Krsna in every time, place, and circumstance, is known as saranagati - unconditional surrender. 1.36 sarvantaryamitam drstva, hareh sambandhato ‘khile aprthag-bhava-tad-drstih, prapattir jnana-bhaktitah Some consider saranagati to be that God consciousness which is realization of the one non-differentiated nature in all beings and objects, by seeing the Supreme Lord as the indwelling Supersoul of everything. However, such a conception falls within the category of calculative devotion (jnana-bhakti). It is not in the line of unadulterated pure devotion (suddha-bhakti). 1.37 nityatvan caiva sastresu, prapatter jnayate budhaih aprapannasya nr-janma-, vaiphalyoktes tu nityata By scriptural reference, the learned know of the eternality of surrender to the Lord, since the futility of human life without that surrender is elucidated therein. In this way, the eternal constitution of surrender is established. 1.38 nanyad icchanti tat pada-, rajah-prapanna-vaisnavah kincid apiti tat tasyah, sadhyatvam ucyate budhaih Because the devotees who have surrendered unto the dust of the lotus feet of the Lord never aspire for anything else whatsoever, the learned affirm that surrender is the attainable goal of all endeavors. 1.39 bhava-duhkha-vinasas ca, para-nistara-yogyata param padam prapattyaiva, krsna-sampraptir eva ca Only by surrender to the Lord can one gain freedom from the miseries of birth, death, disease, and infirmity; fitness to deliver others from those miseries; the holy abode of Lord Visnu; and the devotional service of Lord Krsna. 1.40 sravana-kirtanadinam, bhakty-anganam hi yajane aksamasyapi sarvaptih, prapattyaiva harav iti Everything is accomplished by surrendering unto the lotus feet of Sri Hari, even for one who is unable to execute the integral practices of devotional service based on hearing and chanting. 1.41 sakhya-rasasrita-praya, seti kecit vadanti tu madhuryadau prapannanam, praveso nasti ceti na Some claim that surrender is generally in the relationship of friendship (sakhya-rasa). But it is complete fallacy to think that surrendered souls have no entrance into divine relationships headed by consorthood (madhura-rasa). 1.42 sakrt pravrtti-matrena, prapattih sidhyatiti yat lobhotpadana-hetos tad, alocana-prayojanam Since surrender is achieved by turning to the refuge of the Lord just once, we should earnestly discuss the subject to enable the longing for surrender to be born in us. 1.43 api tad anakulyadi-, sankalpady-anga-laksanat tad anusilaniyatvam, ucyate hi mahajanaih Furthermore, since the constituent parts of surrender - based on acceptance of the favorable and rejection of the unfavorable - have been referred to by authorities and cited in the Scriptures, the great devotees of the Lord teach us the necessity of studying and culturing the art of surrender. 1.44 bhavarti-pidyamano va, bhakti-matrabhilasy api vaimukhya-badhyamano ’nya-, gatis tac charanam vrajet One who is severely afflicted by fear of living in the material world, or, one who, despite having an aspiration for the Lord’s service is nonetheless bound with adversity - such persons, finding no alternative, surrender to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. 1.45 asrayantara-rahitye, vanyasraya-visarjane ananya-gati-bhedas tu, dvi-vidhah parikirtitah The state of finding no other alternative occurs in two ways: in the event of having no other shelter, or in the event of abandoning one’s existing shelter. 1.46 mano-vak-kaya-bhedac ca, tri-vidha saranagatih tasam sarvanga-sampanna, sighram purna-phala-prada nyunadhikyena caitasam, taratamyam phale ‘pi ca One surrenders by thought, word, and deed. Complete surrender in all these aspects promptly affords full success. Otherwise, the fruit attained will be proportionate to the degree of one’s surrender. 1.47 apurva-phalatvam - vinasya sarva-duhkhani, nija-madhurya-varsanam karoti bhagavan bhakte, saranagata-palakah The unprecedented, gracious reward of surrender - Being most affectionate toward His surrendered souls, the Supreme Lord totally dispels their unhappiness, graciously filling their hearts with His sweet absolute presence. 1.48 apy asiddham tadiyatvam, vine ca saranagatim ity apurva-phalatvam hi, tasyah samsanti panditah Without unconditional surrender (saranagati), one cannot conceive of oneself as ‘belonging to Him.’ And this is why the learned sing (par excellence) the glories of surrender’s ability to yield her unprecedented, gracious fruit. 1.49 athava bahubbir etair, uktibhih kim prayojanam sarva-siddhir bhaved eva, govinda-caranasrayat Otherwise, what would have been the need for so abundantly singing her praises? Only by unconditional surrender unto the lotus feet of Govinda is all perfection attained - nothing remains to be attained. 1.50 sri-sanatana-jivadi-, mahajana-samahrtam. api cen nica-samsprstam, piyusam piyatam budhah Even though touched by one as lowly as me, please, O learned devotees, drink this nectar gathered by the great souls headed by Srila Sanatana and Sri Jiva. iti sri-prapanna-jivanamrte upakramamrtam nama prathamo ‘dhyayah thus ends the first chapter Prelude to Approaching Nectar in Life-Nectar of the Surrendered Souls Positive and Progressive Immortality 2.1 Chapter 2 Sri Sastra-vacanamrtam The Nectar of Scriptural Word sruti-smrty-adi-sastresu, prapattir yan nirupyate tad uktam dvitiyadhyaye, sri-sastra-vacanamrte This second chapter, Sri Sastra-vacanamrtam, The Nectar of Scriptural Word, describes surrender as corroborated in the Revealed Scriptures headed by the Vedas (Sruti) and the Religious Codes (Smrti). 2.2 prapattih srutau - yo brahmanam vidadhati-purvam yo brahma-vidyam tasmai gah palayati sma krsnah tam hi devam atma-vrtti-prakasam mumuksur vai saranam amum vrajet Tapanyam (Brahma-Samhita, tika) Surrender is firmly established by the Vedas - “In the beginning of creation, He who created the universal creator, Brahma, and then imparted to Brahma knowledge of Brahman, the Absolute - He is the selfsame Lord Krsna who tends the cows (or nourishes the Vedas [gah means both ‘cows’ and Vedas]). Those desirous of liberation should surrender unto that Lord, who reveals the innate function of the soul.” 2.3-4 tadatmya-yatharthyam smrtau ahankrtir ma-karah syan, na-karas tan nisedhakah tasmat tu namasa ksetri-, svatantryam pratisidhyate bhagavat-paratantro ‘sau, tad ayattatma-jivanah tasmat sva-samarthya-vidhim, tyajet sarvam asesatah Padma-uttara-khanda The cause of the tangible reality of surrender is expounded in the Standard Codes of Religion (Smrti) - “The syllable ma means ‘self-asserting ego’ (the misconception of considering oneself to be a ‘doer’), and the syllable na indicates its prevention. Thus, the act of offering obeisances (namah) nullifies the offerer’s independence. The soul is naturally subordinate to the Almighty, his intrinsic nature and innate function being servitude to the Supreme Lord. Therefore, all actions performed thinking, ‘I am the doer,’ should be utterly abandoned.” 2.5 ahankarad-aprapattih - ahankara-nivrttanam, kesavo nahi duragah ahankara-yutanam hi, madhye parvata-rasayah Brahma-vaivartta Purana The only obstacle to surrender is self-asserting ego - “The Supreme Lord Kesava remains in the company of persons who are free from a mundane conception of life; but there appears to be a great mountain range between the self-asserting egotists and the Lord.” 2.6 advaya-jnanam anasritanam eva jagad-darsanam - yavat prthaktvam idam atmana indriyartha- maya-balam bhagavato jana isa pasyet tavan na samsrtir asau pratisankrameta vyarthapi duhkha-nivaham vahati kriyarthaBhagavatam, 3.9.9 Persons who do not take shelter of the One without a second, the Supreme Lord, simply loiter in the world of birth and death “O Lord, Soul of all souls, the conditioned soul sees this universe as separate from You, and thinks it is meant for his sense enjoyment. But this is only a creation of Your deluding potency (maya). As long as the living being clings to such an illusory separate interest, he does not give up the miserable world of action and reaction, birth and death, despite its utter meaninglessness.” 2.7 tan nityatvam, tad abhave atmano vancitatvat - prapyapi durllabhataram,.manusyam vibudhepsitam yair asrito na govindas, tair atma vancitas ciram Brahma-vaivartta Purana The unsurrendered soul is perpetually deceived; thus, the state of surrender is eternal - “A birth in the human species is so valuable that it is aspired for by the demigods. Those who, despite having taken such a birth, do not take shelter of the lotus feet of Govinda - they deceive themselves perpetually.” 2.8-9 aprapannanam jivana-vaiphalyac ca - asitin caturas caiva, laksams tan jiva-jatisu bhramyadbhih purusaih prapya, manusyam janma-paryayat tad apy aphalatam yatam, tesam atmabhimaninam varakanam anasritya, govinda-carana-dvayam Brahma-vaivartta Purana The utter futility of life without surrender - “After wandering throughout 8,400,000 species, the soul eventually takes a human birth. But that human birth is rendered worthless by those miserable fellows who are so proud of their bodies that they refuse to take shelter of the lotus feet of Lord Govinda.” 2.10 sarvadhamesv api mukti-datrtvam - sarvacara-vivarjitah satha-dhiyo vratya jagad-vancaka dambhahankrti-pana-paisuna-parah papantyaja nisthurah ye canye dhana-dara-putra-niratah sarvadhamas te ‘pi hi sri-govinda-padaravinda-sarana mukta bhavanti dvija Even the lowest of men are liberated by surrender - Nrsimha Purana “O twice-born, persons who are devoid of all virtuous practices, who are outcast, rogues, deceitful, audacious, egotistic, addicted to intoxicants, hotbeds of sin, malicious, cruel-natured, grossly infatuated with son, wife, wealth, etc. - even such extremely fallen persons are liberated by surrendering unto the lotus feet of Sri Govinda.” 2.11 tan nisthasya nadho-gatih - paramartham asesasya, jagatam adi karanam saranyam saranam yato, govindam navasidati Brhan-Naradiya Purana A surrendered soul never falls down - “Sri Govinda is the origin of all the universes, the Supreme Truth, and the shelter of all. One who surrenders unto His lotus feet can never be cast asunder.” 2.12-13 duhkha-haratvam mano-haratvan ca - sthitah priya-hite nityam, ya eva purusarsabhah rajams tava yadu-srestho, vaikunthah purusottamah ya enam samsrayantiha, bhaktya narayanam harim te tarantiha durgani, na me ’trasti vicarana Mahabharata, Santi-parva Surrender unto the Supreme Lord Hari vanquishes misery and charms the heart with the Lord’s divine sweetness - O King, what more can I say? The foremost of the Yadu dynasty, the unassailable great personality who is full of goodwill for you and always your dear friend - He is none other than the Supreme Lord Narayana, Sri Hari. Those who devotedly take full refuge in Him cross over this insurmountable ocean of material existence.” 2.14 abhayamrta-datrtvan ca - ye sankha-cakrabja-karam hi sarnginam khagendra-ketum varadam sriyah patim samasrayante bhava-bhiti-nasanam tesam bhayam nasti vimukti-bhajam Completely vanquishing all fear, surrender bestows the life of eternal nectar - Vamana “The Lord of the Goddess of Fortune bears a conchshell, disc, lotus flower, and bow; He is the Master of Garuda, He is the vanquisher of the fear of mundane existence, He is the bestower of all benedictions. No trace of apprehension remains for those who take refuge in Him, since they qualify for positive immortality.” 2.15 sarvartha-sadhakatvam samsare ‘smin maha-ghore, moha-nidra-samakule ye harim saranam yanti, te krtartha na samsayah Brhan-Naradiya Purana A surrendered soul is successful in all endeavors - “In the dense darkness of this material world which is engulfed in ignorance and sleep, those who surrender unto the holy lotus feet of Lord Hari are successful in all their endeavors. Of this there is no doubt.” 2.16 ajitendriyanam api siva-datvam - kim durapadanam tesam, pumsam uddama-cetasam yair asritas tirtha-padas, carano vyasanatyayah Bhagavatam, 3.23.42 By surrender, even persons of uncontrolled senses attain all good fortune - “The lotus feet of Lord Hari vanquish material existence. By surrendering unto His lotus feet, nothing remains difficult to achieve, even for a person of agitated mind.” 2.17 samsara-klesa-haritvam - sarira manasa divya, vaiyase ye ca manusah bhautikas ca katham klesa, badheran hari-samsrayam Bhagavatam, 3.22.37 All worldly suffering is vanquished for the surrendered soul - “O Vidura, how can a person who has taken shelter of the lotus feet of Sri Hari be stricken with bodily and mental tribulation arising from the elements, other persons, or unfavorable astrological circumstances?” 2.18 saranagatanam ayatna-siddham eva param padam - samasrita ye pada-pallava-plavam mahat-padam punya-yaso murareh bhavambudhir vatsa-padam param padam padam padam yad vipadam na tesam Bhagavatam, 10.14.53 The Supreme Abode of Lord Visnu is effortlessly attainable for the surrendered souls - “This ocean of material existence is as insignificant as the water in a cow’s hoofprint to those persons who have taken full refuge in the supreme shelter - the boat of the lotus feet of Lord Sri Krsna, whose glories are universally sung as purity’s own self. Their destination is the Lord’s supreme abode, never this mundane abode of calamities.” 2.19 sarvatmasritanam vivarta nivrttih - yesam sa eva bhagavan dayayed anantah sarvatmanasrita-pado yadi nirvyalikam te dustaram atitaranti ca deva-mayam naisam mamaham iti dhih sva-srgala-bhaksye Bhagavatam, 2.7.42 The illusion of bodily identification and mundane possessiveness is dispelled for the souls surrendered to the Lord in all respects - “Due to their taking shelter of His lotus feet in all respects, those persons upon whom the Infinite Supreme Lord bestows His unreserved grace surpass the insurmountable illusory energy of the Lord. He does not favor those who ascribe the conceptions of ‘I and mine’ to this material body, which is food for jackals and hounds.” 2.20 tad upeksitanam duhkha-pratikarah ksanika eva - balasya neha saranam pitarau nrsimha nartasya cagadam udanvati majjato nauh taptasya tat-pratividhir ya ihanjasestas tavad vibho tanu-bhrtam tvad-upeksitanam Bhagavatam, 7.9.19 For persons devoid of a relationship with the Supreme Lord Hari, prevention of suffering cannot but be transitory - “O Nrsimha, O Almighty Lord, precautions and remedies are only short-lived when attempted by the suffering embodied souls who are not favored by You. Parents are not the guardians of their child, medicine is not the cure for the diseased, and a boat is not the savior of a man drowning in the ocean.” 2.21 anasritanam asad avagrahad eva vividharttih - tavad bhayam dravina-deha-suhrn-nimittam sokah sprha paribhavo vipulas ca lobhah tavan mamety asad-avagraha arti-mulam yavan na te ’nghrim abhayam pravrnita lokah Bhagavatam, 3.9.6 The various tribulations of the unsurrendered souls are simply due to their obsession with the unreal - “O Lord, as long as the people of the world do not take the safe and sound shelter of Your lotus feet, they remain full of anxiety about their wealth, their bodies, and their friends; overwhelmed with lamentation, hankering, obsession, and intense greed, they cannot obtain relief from the suffering which is deeply rooted in their imaginary conceptions of I and mine.” 2.22 paripurna-kamo harir evasrayaniyo ’nyad-heyam - avismitam tam paripurna-kamam, svenaiva labhena samam prasantam vinopasarpaty aparam hi balisah, sva-langulenatititartti sindhum Bhagavatam, 6.9.22 One should take refuge in the fully self-satisfied Supreme Lord Hari; the shelter of ‘other gods’ yields a lamentably inferior result - “Lord Krsna is perfectly replete in everything desirable, fully self-sufficient, poised and tranquil. Nothing can be astonishing for Him. Only a fool disregards Him to take shelter in any demigod whose propitiation may be prescribed for the accomplishment of worldly benefits.

O Universal Lord, those who do not accept the joy of the shelter of Your lotus feet and pursue the paths of abstract liberation and mundane acquisition - such persons are devastated by Your deluding potency.” 2.25 krsna-carana-saranagateh parama-sadhyatvam - na naka-prstham na ca sarva-bhaumam na paramesthyam na rasadhipatyam na yoga-siddhir apunar-bhavam va vanchanti yat pada-rajah prapannah Bhagavatam, 10.16.37 Full refuge in the lotus feet of Sri Krsna is the supreme objective - “Those souls who have taken refuge in the dust of Your lotus feet have no desire to attain heaven, universal dominion, the post of Lord Brahma, sovereignty over the earth, yogic perfections, or liberation.” 2.26 hari-prapannanam anya-nistara-samarthyam-atmaramanam api hari- pada-prapattis ca - yat pada-samsrayah suta, munayah prasamayanah sadyah punanty upasprstah, svardhuny-apo ’nusevaya Bhagavatam, 1.1.15 Souls surrendered unto the lotus feet of the Lord Hari are competent to deliver others, and the fully self-satisfied souls also surrender to the Lord’s lotus feet - “The slightest association with the supremely tranquil sages who have surrendered unto the lotus feet of the Lord purifies the people of the world; but the river Ganga purifies only those who bathe in it.” 2.27 sri-krsnaika-sarana naiva vidhi-kinkarah - devarsi-bhutapta-nrnam pitrnam na kinkaro nayam rni ca rajan sarvatmana yah saranam saranyam gato mukundam parihrtya karttam Bhagavatam, 11.5.41 Those souls who have exclusively surrendered unto Krsna are not subservient to scriptural injunctions and prohibitions - “O King, one who abandons all worldly obligations and wholeheartedly surrenders unto Mukunda, the exclusive shelter of all beings in every respect - such a person is no longer indebted to the demigods, sages, other life-forms, friends and relatives, mankind, and ancestors.” 2.28 tad anugrhita veda-dharmatita eva - yada yasyanugrhnati, bhagavan atma-bhavitah sa jahati matim loke, vede ca parinisthitam Bhagavatam, 4.29.45 The recipients of the Lord’s mercy are transcendental to Vedic religiosity - “Because of the intense love of His surrendered soul, the Supreme Lord bestows His grace upon that devotee by ushering divine inspiration into his heart.

You are the destroyer of the soul’s illusion, You are the divine wish-fulfilling tree, the refuge of all devotees. Worshippable by Siva and Virinci (Sadasiva in the form of Sri Advaita Acarya, and Brahma in the form of Haridasa Thakura), You are the shelter of all and everything, and You are the dispeller of Your devotee’s suffering which originates in offenses to the holy name (nama-aparadha). You are the only boat for crossing the ocean of this material world ofsuffering.

  <meta itemprop="description" content="Sri Sri Prapanna-jivanamrtam The Complete Unabridged English Edition - Life-Nectar of the Surrendered Souls Positive and Progressive Immortality by the Intimate Servitor of the Illustrious Universal Preceptor of Vaisnava Thought, Vaisnava-siddhantacarya-samrat Jagad-guru Prabhupada Sri Srimad Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Goswami Maharaja: Om Visnupada Paramahamsa Parivrajakacarya-varya Sarva-sastra-siddhanta-vit Astottara-sata- Sri Srimad Bhakti Raksaka Sridhara Deva Goswami Maharaja Published by the Appointed President-Acarya Parivrajakacarya Srimad Bhakti Sundara Govinda Maharaja Rendered into English by Tridandiswami Sripada Bhakti Ananda Sagara Maharaja Preface (translated from the Publisher’s Note of the first Bengali edition) The best introduction to the author of this book is given by the work itself. Pujyapada Parivrajakacarya Tridandiswami Srimad Bhakti Raksaka Sridhara Maharaja is the fit recipient of the grace bestowed upon him by that great Universal Guru who shines like the sun among the Gaudiya Acaryas: Om Visnupada Sri Srimad Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Goswami Prabhupada. Srila Prabhupada, now left this world to join the eternal divine pastimes, is the Divine Agent to flood the world with the nectarine universal preaching of the glory of the Supreme Lord, in the Divine Succession of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Although the devotional community is well-acquainted with the illustrious personality of His Holiness B.R. Sridhara Maharaja, I may nonetheless take the opportunity to enumerate some of his glories herein for my self- purification. The brilliance of his unprecedented scholarship is found in the artful compilation and harmony of Sri Prapanna-jivanamrtam, Life Nectar of the Surrendered Souls, accurately drawn from the axiomatic teachings of pure devotion (bhakti-siddhanta-vani) as evolved by the Vaisnava preceptors in the line of the bona fide Scriptures. We have already seen the extraordinary competence of His Holiness in preaching the beautiful, illuminating conceptions of the kings of transcendental scholars - the Vaisnava Preceptors headed by Sri Rupa, Sri Sanatana, and Sri Jiva - in various languages throughout the whole of India. Upon reading the first Sanskrit poem composed by His Holiness, Sri Bhaktivinoda Viraha Dasakam, our Divine Master commented that the writing was of a happy style. Srila Prabhupada profusely praised the devotional gravity of the presentation, revealing his deep satisfaction and joyful confidence that in times to come the message of Sri Caitanyadeva would be befittingly upheld and preached by the author. Just prior to his entrance into his eternal pastimes, Srila Prabhupada, in preference to hearing devotional prayer (kirtana) performed by devotees recognized for expertise, called for His Holiness’ pure rendering of Sri Rupa-manjari pada, sei mora sampada, the worshipful prayer of the Gaudiya Vaisnavas’ most cherished ideal. The theme of Life-Nectar of the Surrendered Souls is described in the introductory first chapter, Prelude to Approaching Nectar. In some instances throughout the work, the Bengali verse interpretation of the venerated pure devotees has been fittingly given for the translation of the authentic stanzas quoted. In Words of Nectar from the Devotees, statements of the Supreme Lord have occasionally been quoted in conformation with the development of the theme. In his explanatory aphorisms that precede each stanza, the author reveals the unique axiomatic truths (siddhanta) of his Divine Succession. Doubtlessly, the good readers who know the supereminence of the Gaudiya- siddhanta - the axiomatic devotional teachings in the line of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu - will be overjoyed with His Holiness’ novel illuminations. In the epilogue, the author has mentioned his line of Divine Succession and the time and place of the writing of the book. It has been vividly illustrated herein that a life without surrender unto the lotus feet of Sri Krsna is utterly futile, and the most treasured perfection achieved through exclusive surrender has been revealed. This will especially encourage those who are aspiring to enter the land of devotion, drawing them onward to the lotus feet of Sri Hari. And it will infuse spiritual joy and exhilaration in the hearts of the established devotees. This book is the supreme wealth of the surrendered souls. Devotion for the Supreme Lord, Sri Hari-bhakti, is the singular quintessence in this world, and only by exclusive surrender, saranagati, is it happily attained. May this Life-Nectar of the Surrendered Souls graciously appear all the world over, distributing the ever-increasing aspiration to reach the abode of divine ecstasy - the lotus feet of Sri Hari. Just as the repeated rubbing of sandalwood produces more and more charming fragrance, we remain confident that the faithful devotees, whose only pleasure is in conclusive theological truth (sat-siddhanta), will experience the ambrosial devotional fragrance of this holy treatise in their spiritual discussions, and thus relish transcendental delight. We shall consider ourselves blessed when this book inevitably comes to be treasured by the august assembly of the fortunate souls. a Vaisnava’s servant’s servant, Sri Nrsimhananda Brahmacari on the holy anniversary of Srila Bhakti Siddhanta Prabhupada’s departure, Gaurabda 457 (14th January, 1944) at Sri Dhama Navadvipa All glory to the Divine Master and the Supreme Lord Sri Krsna Caitanya Publisher’s Note Sri Sri Prapanna-jivanamrtam, The Life-nectar of the Surrendered Souls, is the crown-jewel of divine literatures as the eternal elixir of life for the exclusively surrendered souls, the bestower of the perpetual relish of full-fledged nectar, and the awakening and sustaining fountainhead of life in Divine Consorthood. Indeed, who can fittingly portray her holy glory and renown? In the same way we cannot but feel ever inadequate when we attempt to sing the glories of the illustrious author, our most worshipful Divine Master, Om Visnupada Sri Srila Bhakti Raksaka Sridhara Deva Goswami Maharaja, the dearmost intimate attendant of the great pioneer pre-eminent among the Gaudiya Acaryas, Sri Gauranga’s transcendental message incarnate - Prabhupada Sri Srila Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Goswami Thakura. Even without world itineracy, the seat of Universal Guru (Jagad-guru) of the world’s renowned gurus has been gracefully won by Srila Sridhara Deva Goswami Maharaja while presiding in the grand, noble distinction of his venerable years of devotional life at the Sri Chaitanya Saraswat Math of Nabadwip, his exclusive, personal holy place of bhajana. Since its first printing, which was in Bengali, this sublime literature has brought heartfelt satisfaction to the stalwart devotees of the highest order, being hailed by them as an Essential Scripture to be unfailingly sung and cultivated as a daily devotional function in spiritual life, as is customarily practiced with the Holy Scriptures such as the Srimad Bhagavad-gita. In both the Eastern and Western countries, its English publication will doubtlessly be similarly worshiped with the utmost reverence, constantly studied and sung with devotion by the surrendered souls of fine theistic intellect, and by the noble souls engaged in their divine search for the Supreme Lord. This monumental work was originally composed in the Sanskrit language. The authentic Bengali translation that was sanctioned by the author is extremely developed, profoundly exploring the heart of the book; scholars who know the internal conclusive scriptural purports can alone realize how difficult is its translation and publication into English. However, by the boundless mercy of the most magnanimous Supreme Lord Sri Caitanyacandra, the fountainhead of all incarnations of Godhead, and by the causeless grace of His most beloved, our Divine Master, and the pure devotees whose hearts are absorbed in divine love - this formidable task has now been fulfilled. Thus, I again and again worship the holy lotus feet of Them all. For their tireless efforts to usher in the Advent of the present edition in its perfectly elegant form, all those Godbrothers and Godsisters who served in the various facets of the publication have attained the unending graces of our Divine Master and the Vaisnavas. They have bound us in eternal gratitude. For executing the task of the English translation, proofing, and editing, special mention is due to Tridandiswami Sripada Bhakti Ananda Sagara Maharaja, assisted by Sriman Nimaisundara Brahmacari Vidyavinoda. And for their dedicated effort in securing the necessary funds and assistance for the printing and publishing of the work in a most dignified presentation, special mention is due to Sripada Dayadhara Gauranga Dasa Brahmacari Bhakti Prabhakara Prabhu and all the good devotees assisting him. In conclusion, invoking the charming verse of Sri Gurupadapadma this humble servant earnestly prays at his holy lotus feet that this crownjewel of Sacred Writings, Sri Sri Prapanna-jivanamrtam, may remain with Her merciful presence in every land, in every home, and in every heart. And in Her gracious acquiescence, may She acknowledge the glorious victory of Her goodwill by churning and overflooding the entire living universe with Her supramundane wave of ecstatic love, to bless all souls with the supreme good fortune. sri-srimad-bhagavat-padambuja-madhu-svadotsavaih sat-padair niksipta madhu-bindavas ca parito bhrasta mukhat gunjitaih yatnaih kincid ihahrtam nija-parasreyo ‘rthina tan maya bhuyobhuya ito rajamsi pada-samlagnani tesam bhaje “The bees, intoxicated in the festival of drinking the honey of the Lord’s lotus feet, busily humming the glories of the Lord, drops of honey from their mouths fall and scatter all around; for my divine prospect, I’ve carefully collected some of those drops herein - and thus do I worship the dust of the holy lotus feet of those saints, again and again.” I beg to remain most humbly, Tridandi-bhiksu Sri Bhakti Sundara Govinda 16 October, 1987 93rd Holy Appearance Day of His Divine Grace Srila Bhakti Raksaka Sridhara Deva Goswami Maharaja This Divine Book was prepared and presented to the Lotus Hands of the Venerable Author by his disciples and aspiring servitors on the celebrated appearance day of Lord Gauracandra, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, March 3, 1988 All glory to the Divine Master and the Supreme Lord Sri Krsna Caitanya Foreword Because the soul is a particle of consciousness, it is endowed with free will. Eliminating free will, only gross matter remains. Without independence, the soul could not progress from bondage to liberation, and his ultimate salvation would have been impossible. But his spirit of exploitation is a foreign force, an intoxicant - a miscalculation that surrounds his independence. Life’s objectives may be scientifically analyzed as threefold: exploitation, renunciation, and dedication. The most common tendency is in those engaged in exploiting other persons, species, or elements, for mundane sense enjoyment. They desire to materially elevate themselves in the present environment, and thus they are described as elevationists. A more sober class discover the severe equal and opposite reactions to worldly pursuits, and they engage in renunciation of the world, in search of an equilibrium comparable to a deep, dreamless slumber. By being unawake to the world, they hope to escape its concomitant reactions and sufferings. Thus their goal is liberation, and they are known as salvationists or liberationists. But through the correct interpretation of the Revealed Scriptures by learned votaries such as Sri Sanatana Goswami, Sri Jiva Goswami, and Sri Ramanuja, the devotees of divinity know the pursuits of both exploitation and renunciation as not only fruitless, but injurious to real progress. The normal, wholesome, and happy plane is in the life of dedication. Without exploiting or borrowing anything from the environment, and without attempting to artificially renounce it, one who is sincere to dedicate himself naturally comes into contact with a higher and more subtle plane of life. By his readiness to give and serve, he will attain to a higher society and achieve an appropriate master. The enjoying spirit forces one to be associated with a lower section to control and enjoy. And the renouncing spirit allures even the scholars with its ‘prestigious’ superiority over exploitation. Thus it is more dangerous, just as a half-truth is more dangerous than falsehood. As it is difficult to awaken someone from the deepest possible sleep, the liberationists may remain for incalculable time within their cell of non-differentiated liberation. But the higher existence will invite the service of one who desires to purely dedicate himself without remuneration. Seva - service, dedication, is the summum bonum of the teachings of the Vaisnava school, the third plane of life where every unit is a dedicating member in an organic whole. In such a normal adjustment, everyone mutually assists one another in their service to the center, the higher recipient, the highest entity. Everything is existing to satisfy Him, because He must possess this qualification to be the Absolute. He is the prime cause of all causes - and everything exists for Him, to satisfy Him. A barren conception of mere ‘deathlessness’ cannot afford us any knowledge of a positive thing, but only freedom from the negative side. If immortality means ’no influence of mortality,’ what, then, is its positive conception? What will be the nature, movement, and progress of that which is immortal? Without this understanding immortality is only an abstract idea. Because it does not appear to exhibit the symptoms of death, stone would be ‘more immortal’ than human beings, and conscious entities would be ‘mortal,’ forever denied immortality! What, then, is the positive conception of immortality? How are the immortal ‘immortal’? What is the positive reality in immortality? How can one become immortal? One must search out his intrinsic location in the universal order. It will not do to attempt to solve only the negative side of life which is full of suffering - birth, death, infirmity, and disease. We should know that there exists a conception of life worth living for. This positive side has been almost totally neglected in general religious views. The ‘immortality’ professed by the schools of Buddha and Sankaracarya yields no positive life. Their goals are maha-nirvana and brahma-sayujya respectively. The Buddhist theory is that after liberation, nothing remains. They crave absolute extinction of material existence (prakrti-nirvana). And the Sankarite monist theory of liberation is to lose one’s individuality by ‘becoming one’ with the non-differentiated aspect of the Absolute. That is, they crave extinction in Brahman (brahma- nirvana). They postulate that when the triad of seer, seen, and seeing (drasta-drsya-darsana), or knower, knowable, and knowledge (jnata- jneya-jnana) culminate at one point, the triad is destroyed (triputi- vinasa) and nothing remains. Material action and reaction ceases in Viraja, the river of passivity, which is located at the uppermost edge of this illusory (mayika) world. And above Viraja is the destination of the Sankarites - the ‘abscissa’ stage or the non-differentiated plane of Brahman, called Brahmaloka, which is located at the lowest edge of the spiritual realm. Both are vague areas of ,negative immortality.’ Brahmaloka is a marginal or ‘buffer’ state midway between the material and spiritual worlds. Composed of innumerable souls, it is an immortal plane devoid of specific variegatedness (nirvisesa). It possesses positivity only in the sense that it is a plane of existence, a background (kastha), but in itself it lacks positive development of variegated existence (kala). The nature of the background is oneness, and development woven over it necessitates plurality or a differentiated nature (kala-kasthadi rupena parinama- pradayini - Candi, Markandeya Purana). In the Bhagavad-gita (15.16), mutable (ksara) and immutable (aksara) existences are described, representing the personal and the impersonal, the development and the basis, or differentiated and non- differentiated conceptions of general existence. The mutable is represented by the multitude of embodied living beings, while the immutable aspect is the great expanse of the all-accommodating Absolute, the Brahman (8.3). In the analysis of worldly action, the most subtle form of unfructified past action, prior to the present tendency (the seedling stage) to sin, has been defined (Bhakti-rasamrita-sindhu, Purva 1.23) as unknowable, indistinct, and of untraceable origin (kuta). The immutable Brahman aspect of the Absolute is similarly defined as being one-dimensional - undetectable, unspecific, and of no definite color, sound, or taste; an unknown and unknowable ‘un-understandable’ stage of existence (kuta). But the Supreme Lord, Krsna, is above both the mutable and immutable existences, and thus His glories are sung throughout the Vedas and in the world as the Purusottama, the Supreme Personality (Bhagavad-gita, 15.18). Sri Sukadeva Goswami affirms that in the most remote and distant plane, Lord Krsna is to be found: everywhere is He - the fountainhead of all conceptions (vidura-kasthaya, Bhagavatam, 2.4.14). He cannot be eliminated. Thus, the ‘immortality’ of the impersonalistic schools such as Buddhists, Sankarites, etc., offers no positive life. But in Vaisnavism, immortality is positive, dynamic existence. Above the non-differentiated Brahman aspect of the Absolute, the transcendental, variegated existence begins in the first glimpse of the spiritual sky, the plane known as Paravyoma (Chaitanya-charitamrita, Madhya 19.153). Situated there in the spiritual plane is the positive Kingdom of God: firstly Vaikuntha, then Ayodhya, Dvaraka, Mathura, and finally, above all, Goloka. Transcending the vague areas of ’negative immortality’ that the impersonalists aspire for, the devotees - the Vaisnavas - dedicate themselves to the life of eternal devotional service to the Supreme Lord of the transcendental realm (Bhagavad-gita, 18.54). Although the soul can maladopt himself to a fallen state of existence in the planes of exploitation and renunciation, he is inherently adoptable to the positive life in the Kingdom of God. And fully blossomed, he reaches the realm of Goloka (svarupe sabara haya golokete sthiti - Sri Sri Krsnera Astottara-sata-nama). Sri Prapanna-jivanamrtam: amrta means ‘undying,’ or ’nectar,’ and jivana means ’life.’ Positive immortality is possible only for the surrendered (prapannanam). All others are necessarily mortal. Only those who have wholly given themselves to the center are living in eternality. Surrender is fully established in its excellence and its constant position. Yet there is variegatedness within that constancy, in the form of progressive movement, or pastimes (vilasa). The Supreme Absolute Personality being infinitely superior to both the mutable “mortals’ and the immutable “immortal’ (negative) Brahman, only the svarupa-siddha souls - those who are perfectly established in their divine relationship with Him - are eternally freed from the disease of mutation and mortality ( svarupena-vyavasthitih Bhagavatam, 2. 10.6). With a broad vision, we must know ourselves as created of smaller stuff, and thus only with assistance from above can we improve our situation and achieve a position in the higher plane. A submissive, serving attitude is necessary in us. If we submit, the universal dictatorial aspect of the Absolute will take us upward to a higher prospect. He is the autocrat, the absolute knowledge, the absolute good - everything about Him is absolute. Being in a vulnerable position as we experience in this world, why, then, should we not submit to Him? The road to the sphere of transcendence (adhoksaja) is the deductive or descending method (avaroha-pantha). We can reach the absolute good, the absolute will, by His consent alone. Only by faith in absolute surrender is anyone allowed entry into that domain, never by ,exploration,’ by,colonization,’ or by attempting to become a,monarch’ there. No inductive or ascending method (aroha-pantha) such as renunciation or yoga, etc., can compel Him to accept us. Whosoever He chooses can alone reach Him (Svetasvataropanisad, 6.23). Although the highest point of the renunciates is desirelessness or freedom from possessiveness, the surrendered soul (saranagata) is naturally desireless ( akincana, Chaitanya-charitamrita, Madhya 22.99). Detachment is only the negative side of surrender, and above selflessness, the devotee surrenders himself to the higher substance, and this is to be awake in another world, another plane of life. Such is the positive, Vaisnavaconception of life - to determine one’s real self beyond the jurisdiction of the world of misconception. The nature of the progressive substance is eternal existence, knowledge, and beauty (sac-cid-ananda). The one harmonizing organic whole (advaya-jnana-tattva) contains all similarities and differences, held inconceivably in the hand of the Absolute (acintya-bhedabheda- tattva). And there is no anarchy in the absolute power. Nonetheless, mercy is found to be above justice. Above judiciousness, the supreme position is held by love, sympathy, and beauty: ‘I am the absolute power, but I am friendly to you all. Knowing this, you need never fear (Bhagavad-gita, 5.29).’ This revelation relieves us of all apprehension: we are not victims of a chaotic environment, but it is judicious, considerate - and the ultimate dispenser is our friend. Sri Jiva Goswami has stated that of the six symptoms of surrender, to embrace the guardianship of the Lord (goptrtve varanam) is central, since total surrender expresses the same ideal. The remaining five symptoms of accepting the favorable, rejecting the unfavorable, faith in the Lord’s protection, full self-surrender, and humility, are natural contributing associate-servitors to the ideal (angangi-bhedena sad-vidha; tatra ‘goptrtve varanam’ evangi, saranagati-sabdenaikarthyat; anyani tv angani tat parikaratvat - Bhakti-sandarbha, 236). Surrender is the foundation of the world of devotion. It is the very life and essence. One cannot enter into that domain without surrender. It must be present in every form of service, and to attempt divine service without it will be mere imitation or a lifeless formality. The entire gist of the Vedic instruction is to dedicate oneself to the service of the Lord. In his commentary of Srimad-Bhagavatam, Sri Sridhara Swamipada has stated that only if the practices of devotion are initially offered to the Supreme Lord can they be recognized as devotion. To attempt to execute them and subsequently offer them cannot be pure devotion (iti nava laksanani yasyah sa, adhitena ced bhagavati visnau bhaktih kriyate, sa carpitaiva sati yadi kriyeta, na tu krta sati pascad arpyeta) Without surrender, the activity will be adulterated with exploitation, renunciation, artificial meditation (karma, jnana,yoga), and so on. By constitution, the soul is the Lord’s servant, and the Lord has the right to make or mar, to do anything according to His sweet will. If accepting this truth we undertake the devotional practices such as hearing, chanting, remembering, and worshipping, only then will our activity be devotional. Only the activity of the self-dedicated soul can be devotion. Sincere prayer will help us to seek the help of the Lord, but, again, prayer in the spirit of surrender can alone reach Him (Saranagati, 1.5). The path of devotion entails increasing our negative status to invite the positive to descend and embrace us: ‘I am very low, and You are so high. You can purify me, take me and utilize me for Your higher purpose. Be pleased. Otherwise I am helpless, neglected.’ It is impossible to take Him captive in the cage of our knowledge. Only the way of devotion can help us. In every respect He is high, great, and infinite - and we are similarly small. His mercy - His sympathy, love, and grace, are the only medium through which we can come together. And good faith is autonomous in that sweet land which is so high that we will earnestly hope and pray for the association of the higher existence as His slave; and that also will be our happy prospect for the future. Krsna is not within our purview, and thus we are always recommended by Scriptures and saints to approach the bona fide Divine Master and Vaisnavas. To satisfy the Supreme Lord, the criterion is to satisfy our Gurudeva: if Gurudeva is dissatisfied with us, the Lord is surely dissatisfied. An analogy has been cited in the Scriptures where the Lord is compared to the sun, the Guru to a pond, and the disciple to a lotus flower. If the pond withdraws, the very sun will scorch and dry up the lotus - and the lotus will be cheered by the sun as long as the water supports and surrounds it. Yasya prasadad bhagavat prasado, yasyaprasadan na gatih kuto ‘pi, dhyayam stavams tasya yasas tri- sandhyam, vande guroh sri-caranaravindam (Gurvastakam, 8): ‘I bow down to the lotus feet of Sri Gurudeva. By his grace we achieve the grace of Krsna; without his grace, we are lost. Therefore, at daybreak, noon, and evening, we meditate upon and sing the glories of Sri Gurudeva, and pray for his mercy.’ The Vaisnava Guru’s dealings with the disciple are all grace, and his grace is his will to extend his wealth to the disciple. His instruction is the medium of asserting his will, which is service for the satisfaction of the Lord. And by service, we invite his grace. By an earnest desire to serve, we draw his sympathy and his willing extension of goodwill to encourage us in our relationship with the supreme entity. Firstly, surrender: we must offer him exclusive respect (pranipata), otherwise we shall not allow ourselves to approach him. Secondly, we may make our sincere and substantial inquiry (pariprasna). In a surrendered spirit, we may hear our Divine Master’s messages which he delivers to us from his venerated seat, the Vyasasana. In that conducive setting, the proper inspiration and dictation may fortuitously come down to us. And finally, to render service (sevaya) enables us to taste the essence (Bhagavad-gita, 4.34). On the instruction of his Gurudeva Devarsi Narada, Vyasadeva had to undergo a progressive development (Bhagavatam, 1.5). Narada is established in non-calculative devotion (jnana-sunya-bhakti, or jnana- vimukta-bhakti-paramah ), and above Narada is Uddhava, who is established in exclusive divine love for Krsna (premaika-nisthah). Until one reaches Goloka, where there is full-fledged Krsna conception, all other stages may be changeable. There is no further change when one is firmly established in his serving relationship with the Original Lord (svayam-bhagavan), Krsna. In the narrative of Brhad-Bhagavatamrtam, Gopakumara passes through Vaikuntha, Ayodhya, Mathura, Dvaraka, and then he finally arrives in Vrndavana. There, his particular divine relationship with the Lord firmly culminates in friendship (sakhya-rasa). For him, the previous stages were passing, although for others a permanent relationship may occur in one of them. They are progressive stages of,positive immortality.’ On the banks of the Godavari river, in progressively deeper and deeper planes, the entirety of theological development was expressed in the conversation between Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu and Sri Ramananda Raya. A positive hierarchy of divine relationships with the Lord exists in progressive stages for the various types of devotees ( karmibhyah … kah krti, Upadesamritam, 10), each type having its characteristic central relationship (vaikunthaj … viveki na kah, Upadesamritam, 9). In the divine realm, the depth and degree of surrender may also be measured according to the science of mellows (rasa-tattva): peacefulness, servitorship, friendship, parenthood, and consorthood (santa-, dasya-, sakhya-, vatsalya-and madhura-rasa) are the natural divisions, each consecutively of a finer layer. And higher than even the direct consorthood of the Godhead is the most elevated of the entire compass of devotional services - the divine service of the Supreme Predominated Moiety (Sri Radha-dasya). According to the intensity of surrender - to the point of no return - the quality of the magnitude of truth encountered may be measured. The inner sweetness of the truth and its infinite characteristic attracts the devotees’ hearts to the highest degree, so much that they never feel any satisfaction of achievement in what is actually the acme of their highest fortune. In Vaikuntha, only peacefulness and servitorship are present, with a hint of friendship. If we commit the offense of giving more attention to law than to love, we will be ‘cast down’ from Goloka to Vaikuntha: Goloka is the land of love, and there the inhabitants know nothing more. And by love is meant self-sacrifice and self-forgetfulness for the service of Krsna, without a care for one’s good or bad future - total risk in the extreme. In his Bhakti-sandarbha, Sri Jiva Goswami defines ‘Bhagavan,’ the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as more than ‘Lord Narayana of Vaikuntha, the most powerful in all phases.’ Above that, His existence, appearance, and nature attracts everyone to serve Him, love Him, and die for Him (bhajaniya-guna-visista). His qualification is so beautiful. Thus, the highest conception of the Godhead is the Krsna conception, and He can be known by the devotees in Krsna consciousness. Those who serve and worship the Supreme Lord according to the scriptural regulation and calculation belong to the category of Vaikuntha worship. In Vaikuntha, in the initial transcendental conscious conception (adhoksaja), the Godhead as Lord Narayana accepts reverential service in His Majestic Dignity. But the devotees of the highest order are exclusively surrendered to the service of Lord Krsna with their innermost love and faith. The Krsna conception of Goloka Vrndavana is corroborated in the Srimad Bhagavatam, which is the greatest interpretation of the Vedic Scriptures. And Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu is known to be Krsna Himself, united with His highest potency, Sri Radha. Mahaprabhu Sri Caitanyadeva has clearly revealed that the genuine interpretation and purpose of all the Revealed Scriptures is to faithfully guide us to the highest goal: the domain of love and unconditional surrender unto the central power of truth, personified in Lord Krsna as beauty and affection. Not power, but affection is the highest force to attract us all. Consciously or unconsciously, the absolute position is held by love and affection, and love is superior to all power and knowledge. It is the real fulfillment of the inner heart. Our inner existence wants only love, beauty, and affection - neither knowledge nor power. The finite cannot capture the infinite, but the infinite can make Himself known to the finite. And when the infinite appears as a member of the finite land, the highest gain of the finite is achieved. Krsna carries His father’s shoes, and He cries when chastised by His mother. Through love, the Absolute comes down to the finite. The infinite’s most intimate approach to the finite is found in Vrndavana. The infinite comes to embrace the finite in its fullest capacity (aprakrta), mixing with finite things so closely that people cannot perceive the Lord’s transcendental Godly character as the Divinity. We, the infinitesimal souls, can attain our greatest fortune when the infinite comes to us in His highest approach - as if He were one of us! His approach is so merciful, so great, so intimate, and so perfect. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, who is sweetness and magnanimity combined, openly announced that we are all natural slaves of the highest entity (Chaitanya-charitamrita, Madhya 20.108). But this is slavery to the great force of love and beauty. It is the greatest fortune to be utilized in any way by the absolute existence, knowledge, and beauty - to be in harmony with the highest center. No one is forced or barred but this is the soul’s intrinsic nature. Faithfully in the Divine Succession from Nitya-lila-pravista Om Visnupada Paramahamsa Astottara-sata Sri Srimad Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Goswami Prabhupada, especially inspired by the divine message of Srila Thakura Bhaktivinoda’s Saranagati, and attending the authentic Gaudiya Vaisnava literatures such as Sri Hari-bhakti-vilasa and Bhakti-sandarbha as well as the writings of other Authorized Divine Successions such as the Ramanuja Sampradaya - this Sri Sri Prapanna- jivanamrtam has been compiled in order to supply the devotees’ spiritual sustenance and nourishment. Surrender is the indispensable necessity in the life of a devotee, and Life-Nectar of the Surrendered Souls will sustain and fortify the surrendered souls as the nectar in their lives of Positive and Progressive Immortality. 1.1 Chapter 1 Upakramamrtam - Prelude to Approaching Nectar atha mangalacaranam - sri-guru-gaura-gandharva-, govindanghrin ganaih saha vande prasadato yesam, sarvarambhah subhankarah Auspicious invocation - I make my obeisance unto the lotus feet of my Divine Master, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, Sri Sri Gandharva-Giridhari (Sri Sri Radha and Krsna), and Their associates. By Their grace, all endeavors are successful. 1.2 gaura-vag-vigraham vande, gaurangam gaura-vaibhavam gaura-sankirtanonmattam, gaura-karunya-sundaram I make my obeisance unto the Deity, Gaura-Saraswati - the personified message of the Golden Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu - whose bodily luster is of a beautiful golden hue, like that of the selfsame Lord Gaurasundara; who is the personal expansion of that Supreme Lord Gaurahari; who is always intoxicated by preaching the message of that Golden Lord; and whose divine beauty blooms in the revelation of Lord Gauranga’s mercy potency. (This is the fundamental meaning of the verse. Within the scope of the Sanskrit language, various expanded purports may be drawn from the original.) 1.3 guru-rupa-harim gauram, radha-ruci-rucavrtam nityam naumi navadvipe, nama-kirtana-nartanaih Perpetually do I sing the glories of Lord Gauranga, who is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Sri Hari, embraced by the heart and halo of Sri Radhika, and who has descended as the Divine Master. In this holy abode of Sri Navadvipa Dhama, He is absorbed in the pastimes of profusely chanting the holy names, dancing in ecstasy. (As with verse two, expanded purports may be drawn from this verse.) 1.4 srimat-prabhu-padambhoja-, madhupebhyo namo namah trpyantu krpaya te ’tra, prapanna-jivanamrte Again and again I make my obeisance unto the eternal personal servitors of my Divine Master, who drink the nectar of his lotus feet. I pray they may be graciously pleased in tasting this Life-Nectar of the Surrendered Souls. 1.5 atma-vijnaptih - aty-arvacina-rupo ‘pi, pracinanam susammatan slokan katipayan atra, caharami satam mude A humble petition - Despite my disqualifications, for the satisfaction of the pure devotees I have compiled in this book an anthology of stanzas that are well established by our predecessors. 1.6 tad-vag-visargo janatagha-viplavo yasmin prati-slokam abaddhavaty api namany anantasya yaso ’nkitani yat srnvanti gayanti grnanti sadhavah “Even if every stanza is imperfectly composed, that is, unlucidly expressed, the sins of the people are totally vanquished by those expressions or books in which the glorious holy names of the Infinite Supreme Lord are described - since the pure devotees hear those holy names (from a qualified preacher), they solitarily sing those holy names (even in the absence of others), and they chant the unending glories of those holy names (in the presence of a deserving listener).” 1.7 abhivyakta mattah prakrti-laghu-rupad api budha vidhatri siddharthan hari-gunamayi vah krtir iyam pulindenapy agnih kim u samidham unmathya janito hiranya-sreninam apaharati nantah kalusatam “O learned personalities, this treatise, composed of the divine qualities of Lord Hari, will fulfill your cherished wishes despite the fact that it is presented by me, a very insignificant person. Does not the fire ignited from pieces of wood rubbed together by a low-born barbarian dissipate the impurities in gold?” 1.8 yathokta rupa-padena, nicenotpadite ’nale hemnah suddhis tathaivatra, viraharti-hrtih satam As Srila Rupa Goswamipada has (in his humility) expressed that gold can be purified with fire lit by a barbarian, similarly, the pure devotees’ grief born of their separation from the Lord may also be dispelled by this book (which will light the lamp of their divine love for the Lord). 1.9 antah kovi-yasas-kamam, sadhutavaranam bahih sudhyantu sadhavah sarve, duscikitsyam imam janam O saintly devotees, please purify this wrongdoer who on the pretext of saintliness desires in his heart the prestige of a poet, and who is thus afflicted with the practically incurable disease of insincerity. 1.10 krsna-gatha-priya bhakta, bhakta-gatha-priyo harih kathancid ubhayor atra, prasangas tat prasidatam Tidings of Lord Krsna are naturally very dear to the devotees, and tidings of the Lord’s devotees are also dear to Him. Since narratives of both the Supreme Lord and His devotees can be found within this book, I have hope, O pure devotees, that you may be propitiated hereby. 1.11 svabhava-krpaya santo, mad uddesya-malinatam samsodhyang ikurudhvam bho, hy ahaituka krpabdhayah O pure devotees, by your natural divine grace, kindly purify me of ill motives (offenses) and accept this treatise. Certainly you will do so, because you are the ocean of causeless mercy. 1.12-14 atha grantha-paricayah - granthe ‘smin parame nama, prapanna-jivanamrte dasadhyaye prapannanam, jivana-prana-dayakam varddhakam posakam nityam, hrdindriya-rasayanam atimartya-rasollasa-, paraspara-sukhavaham viraha-milanarthaptam, krsna-karsna-kathamrtam prapatti-visayam vakyam, coddhrtam sastra-sammatam Introduction to the book - The substance expressed within the ten chapters of this holy book called Prapanna-jivanamrtam gives life to the surrendered souls, effecting their eternal growth and nourishment. It is the panacea of the heart and spiritual senses, bestowing those dedicated devotees’ mutual happiness by the ever-increasingly newer and newer play of supramundane joy (aprakrta-rasa). Lord Krsna and His associates are portrayed in their natural pastimes of separation and union, and the line of unconditional surrender as established by Scriptures and saints has been elucidated. 1.15-22 atra cananya-cittanam, krsna-pada-rajojusam krsna-pada-prapannanam, krsnarthe ‘khila-karmanam krsna-premaika-lubdhanam, krsnocchistaika jivinam krsna-sukhaika-vanchanam, krsna-kinkara-sevinam krsna-viccheda-dagdhanam, krsna-sangollasadd-hrdam krsna-svajana-bandhunam, krsnaika-dayitatmanam bhaktanam hrdayodghati-, marma-gathamrtena ca bhaktarti-hara-bhaktasa-, bhista-purtikaram tatha sarva-samsaya-cchedi-hrd-, granthi-bhij jnana-bhasitam apurva-rasa-sambhara-, camatkarita-cittakam viraha-vyadhi-santapta-, bhakta-citta-mahausadham yuktayuktam parityajya, bhaktarthakhila-cestitam atma-pradana-paryanta-, pratijnantah-pratisrutam bhakta-premaika-vasya-sva-, svarupollasa-ghositam purnasvasakaram saksat, govinda-vacanamrtam samahrtam pibantu bhoh, sadhavah suddha-darsanah Carefully compiled in this book is the nectar of the deep, heartrevealing transcendental messages of those devotees whose hearts are unalloyed; who are servitors of the dust of the lotus feet of Krsna; who perform their every act for Krsna; who are filled with insatiable desire exclusively in love of Krsna and sustain their lives on Krsna’s remnants alone; who desire only Krsna’s pleasure andserve the servants of Krsna; whose hearts burn in separation of Krsna and overflow with ecstasy in the association of Krsna; whose relative and friend is Krsna; and whose one and only beloved is Krsna. Along with these expressions of the devotees are carefully collected the words of supreme nectar - springing directly from the lotus mouth of Lord Govinda - which vanquish the heartbreak of the devotees; which fulfill the devotee’s hopes and earnest aspirations; which destroy all doubt and sever the knot of ignorance; which are dazzling with transcendental wisdom and astonish the heart by miraculous waves of divine rapture, which are the great panacea for the devotee’s heart afflicted with the piercing pangs of separation; which are incited wholly for the devotee irrespective of his qualification or disqualification, so much so, that the Lord is bound by His pledge to give Himself to His devotee; and which openly proclaim with great ecstasy that His very nature is to be subjugated solely by the affection of His devotee, reassuring His devotees in all circumstances. O pure and spotless devotees, may you drink deeply the quintessence of these divine elixirs. 1.23 adhyaya-paricayah - atraiva prathamadhyaye, upakramamrtabhidhe mangalacaranan catma-, vijnaptir vastu-nirnayah grantha-paricayo ‘dhyaya-, visayas ca nivesitah Chapter summary - An auspicious invocation, a humble petition, an introduction to the book and its chapters, and the theme of the philosophy of the book have, to the best of my ability, all been entered within this first chapter named Upakramamrtam or Prelude to Approaching Nectar. 1.24 dvitiyadhyayake nama, sri-sastra-vacanamrte prapatti-visaya nana-, sastroktih sannivesita In the second chapter, entitled Sri Sastra-vacanamrtam, The Nectar of Scriptural Word, various scriptural quotations regarding surrender to the Supreme Lord have been compiled. 1.25 trtiyato ‘stamam yavat, sri-bhakta-vacanamrte prapattih sad-vidha prokta, bhagavata-ganodita Chapters three to eight inclusive are entitled Sri Bhakta- vacanamrtam, Words of Nectar from the Devotees. Beautifully expressed by the lotus lips of the pure devotees of the Lord, many stanzas describing the six limbs of exclusive surrender are quoted therein. 1.26-27 anakulyasya sankalpah, pratikulya-vivarjanam raksisyatiti visvaso, goptrtve varanam tatha atma-niksepa karpanye, sad-vidha saranagatih evam paryayatas casminn, ekaikadhyaya-sangrahah These six chapters have been compiled, each consecutively dealing with the six limbs of surrender, which are as follows: 1. To accept everything favorable for devotion to Krsna 2. To reject everything unfavorable for devotion to Krsna 3. To be confident that Krsna will grant His protection 4. To embrace Krsna’s guardianship 5. To offer oneself unto Him 6. To consider oneself lowly and bereft 1.28 adhyaye navame nama, bhagavad-vacanamrte slokamrtam samahrtam, saksad-bhagavatoditam In the ninth chapter entitled Sri Bhagavad-vacanamrtam, Words of Nectar from the Supreme Lord, nectarean stanzas emanating directly from the lotus mouth of the Supreme Lord have been compiled. 1.29 dasame caramadhyaye, cavasesamrtabhidhe guru-krsna-smrtau grantha-, syopasamharanam krtam Absorbed in thought of the Divine Master and Lord Sri Krsna, the tenth and final chapter entitled Sri Avasesamrtam, The Divine Remnants of Nectar, was composed as the epilogue of the book. 1.30 uddhrta-sloka-purve tu, tad artha-suprakasakam vakyan ca yatnatas tatra, yatha-jnanam nivesitam Prior to each stanza quoted, an aphorism illuminating its inner purport has been carefully entered according to my best insight. 1.31 bhagavad-gauracandranam, vadanendu-sudhatmika bhaktoktair vesita sloka, bhakta-bhavodita yatah Being revealed by the Lord Himself adopting the heart of a devotee, the stanzas of pure nectar emanating from the moon of Sri Gauracandra have been entered along with the stanzas of the devotees. 1.32 prapattya saha cananya-, bhakter naikatya-hetutah ananya-bhakti-sambandham, bahu-vakyam ihoddhrtam Many expressions of exclusive devotion (ananya-bhakti) have been recorded herein, since exclusive devotion is most intimately related to surrender. 1.33 bhagavad-bhakta-sastranam, sambandho ‘sti parasparam tat tat pradhanyato namnam, prabbeda-karanam smrtam Actually, Words of Nectar from the Supreme Lord, Words of Nectar from the Devotees, and The Nectar of Scriptural Word are all seen to be interrelated. Still, they have been portrayed separately due to their individual importance. 1.34 praty-adhyaya-visesas tu, tatra tatraiva vaksyate mahajana-vicarasya, kincid alocyate ‘dhuna The unique characteristic of each chapter will be accordingly expressed therein. Now (in this respect), we may have some general deliberation, in the line of the great devotees of the Lord. 1.35 vastu-nirnayah - bhagavad-bhaktitah sarvam, ity utsrjya vidher api kainkaryam krsna-padaika-, srayatvam saranagatih Theme of the work - Being governed by the faith that all success is achieved by serving the Supreme Lord, to abandon servitude to even scriptural injunctions and take exclusive refuge in the lotus feet of Sri Krsna in every time, place, and circumstance, is known as saranagati - unconditional surrender. 1.36 sarvantaryamitam drstva, hareh sambandhato ‘khile aprthag-bhava-tad-drstih, prapattir jnana-bhaktitah Some consider saranagati to be that God consciousness which is realization of the one non-differentiated nature in all beings and objects, by seeing the Supreme Lord as the indwelling Supersoul of everything. However, such a conception falls within the category of calculative devotion (jnana-bhakti). It is not in the line of unadulterated pure devotion (suddha-bhakti). 1.37 nityatvan caiva sastresu, prapatter jnayate budhaih aprapannasya nr-janma-, vaiphalyoktes tu nityata By scriptural reference, the learned know of the eternality of surrender to the Lord, since the futility of human life without that surrender is elucidated therein. In this way, the eternal constitution of surrender is established. 1.38 nanyad icchanti tat pada-, rajah-prapanna-vaisnavah kincid apiti tat tasyah, sadhyatvam ucyate budhaih Because the devotees who have surrendered unto the dust of the lotus feet of the Lord never aspire for anything else whatsoever, the learned affirm that surrender is the attainable goal of all endeavors. 1.39 bhava-duhkha-vinasas ca, para-nistara-yogyata param padam prapattyaiva, krsna-sampraptir eva ca Only by surrender to the Lord can one gain freedom from the miseries of birth, death, disease, and infirmity; fitness to deliver others from those miseries; the holy abode of Lord Visnu; and the devotional service of Lord Krsna. 1.40 sravana-kirtanadinam, bhakty-anganam hi yajane aksamasyapi sarvaptih, prapattyaiva harav iti Everything is accomplished by surrendering unto the lotus feet of Sri Hari, even for one who is unable to execute the integral practices of devotional service based on hearing and chanting. 1.41 sakhya-rasasrita-praya, seti kecit vadanti tu madhuryadau prapannanam, praveso nasti ceti na Some claim that surrender is generally in the relationship of friendship (sakhya-rasa). But it is complete fallacy to think that surrendered souls have no entrance into divine relationships headed by consorthood (madhura-rasa). 1.42 sakrt pravrtti-matrena, prapattih sidhyatiti yat lobhotpadana-hetos tad, alocana-prayojanam Since surrender is achieved by turning to the refuge of the Lord just once, we should earnestly discuss the subject to enable the longing for surrender to be born in us. 1.43 api tad anakulyadi-, sankalpady-anga-laksanat tad anusilaniyatvam, ucyate hi mahajanaih Furthermore, since the constituent parts of surrender - based on acceptance of the favorable and rejection of the unfavorable - have been referred to by authorities and cited in the Scriptures, the great devotees of the Lord teach us the necessity of studying and culturing the art of surrender. 1.44 bhavarti-pidyamano va, bhakti-matrabhilasy api vaimukhya-badhyamano ’nya-, gatis tac charanam vrajet One who is severely afflicted by fear of living in the material world, or, one who, despite having an aspiration for the Lord’s service is nonetheless bound with adversity - such persons, finding no alternative, surrender to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. 1.45 asrayantara-rahitye, vanyasraya-visarjane ananya-gati-bhedas tu, dvi-vidhah parikirtitah The state of finding no other alternative occurs in two ways: in the event of having no other shelter, or in the event of abandoning one’s existing shelter. 1.46 mano-vak-kaya-bhedac ca, tri-vidha saranagatih tasam sarvanga-sampanna, sighram purna-phala-prada nyunadhikyena caitasam, taratamyam phale ‘pi ca One surrenders by thought, word, and deed. Complete surrender in all these aspects promptly affords full success. Otherwise, the fruit attained will be proportionate to the degree of one’s surrender. 1.47 apurva-phalatvam - vinasya sarva-duhkhani, nija-madhurya-varsanam karoti bhagavan bhakte, saranagata-palakah The unprecedented, gracious reward of surrender - Being most affectionate toward His surrendered souls, the Supreme Lord totally dispels their unhappiness, graciously filling their hearts with His sweet absolute presence. 1.48 apy asiddham tadiyatvam, vine ca saranagatim ity apurva-phalatvam hi, tasyah samsanti panditah Without unconditional surrender (saranagati), one cannot conceive of oneself as ‘belonging to Him.’ And this is why the learned sing (par excellence) the glories of surrender’s ability to yield her unprecedented, gracious fruit. 1.49 athava bahubbir etair, uktibhih kim prayojanam sarva-siddhir bhaved eva, govinda-caranasrayat Otherwise, what would have been the need for so abundantly singing her praises? Only by unconditional surrender unto the lotus feet of Govinda is all perfection attained - nothing remains to be attained. 1.50 sri-sanatana-jivadi-, mahajana-samahrtam. api cen nica-samsprstam, piyusam piyatam budhah Even though touched by one as lowly as me, please, O learned devotees, drink this nectar gathered by the great souls headed by Srila Sanatana and Sri Jiva. iti sri-prapanna-jivanamrte upakramamrtam nama prathamo ‘dhyayah thus ends the first chapter Prelude to Approaching Nectar in Life-Nectar of the Surrendered Souls Positive and Progressive Immortality 2.1 Chapter 2 Sri Sastra-vacanamrtam The Nectar of Scriptural Word sruti-smrty-adi-sastresu, prapattir yan nirupyate tad uktam dvitiyadhyaye, sri-sastra-vacanamrte This second chapter, Sri Sastra-vacanamrtam, The Nectar of Scriptural Word, describes surrender as corroborated in the Revealed Scriptures headed by the Vedas (Sruti) and the Religious Codes (Smrti). 2.2 prapattih srutau - yo brahmanam vidadhati-purvam yo brahma-vidyam tasmai gah palayati sma krsnah tam hi devam atma-vrtti-prakasam mumuksur vai saranam amum vrajet Tapanyam (Brahma-Samhita, tika) Surrender is firmly established by the Vedas - “In the beginning of creation, He who created the universal creator, Brahma, and then imparted to Brahma knowledge of Brahman, the Absolute - He is the selfsame Lord Krsna who tends the cows (or nourishes the Vedas [gah means both ‘cows’ and Vedas]). Those desirous of liberation should surrender unto that Lord, who reveals the innate function of the soul.” 2.3-4 tadatmya-yatharthyam smrtau ahankrtir ma-karah syan, na-karas tan nisedhakah tasmat tu namasa ksetri-, svatantryam pratisidhyate bhagavat-paratantro ‘sau, tad ayattatma-jivanah tasmat sva-samarthya-vidhim, tyajet sarvam asesatah Padma-uttara-khanda The cause of the tangible reality of surrender is expounded in the Standard Codes of Religion (Smrti) - “The syllable ma means ‘self-asserting ego’ (the misconception of considering oneself to be a ‘doer’), and the syllable na indicates its prevention. Thus, the act of offering obeisances (namah) nullifies the offerer’s independence. The soul is naturally subordinate to the Almighty, his intrinsic nature and innate function being servitude to the Supreme Lord. Therefore, all actions performed thinking, ‘I am the doer,’ should be utterly abandoned.” 2.5 ahankarad-aprapattih - ahankara-nivrttanam, kesavo nahi duragah ahankara-yutanam hi, madhye parvata-rasayah Brahma-vaivartta Purana The only obstacle to surrender is self-asserting ego - “The Supreme Lord Kesava remains in the company of persons who are free from a mundane conception of life; but there appears to be a great mountain range between the self-asserting egotists and the Lord.” 2.6 advaya-jnanam anasritanam eva jagad-darsanam - yavat prthaktvam idam atmana indriyartha- maya-balam bhagavato jana isa pasyet tavan na samsrtir asau pratisankrameta vyarthapi duhkha-nivaham vahati kriyarthaBhagavatam, 3.9.9 Persons who do not take shelter of the One without a second, the Supreme Lord, simply loiter in the world of birth and death “O Lord, Soul of all souls, the conditioned soul sees this universe as separate from You, and thinks it is meant for his sense enjoyment. But this is only a creation of Your deluding potency (maya). As long as the living being clings to such an illusory separate interest, he does not give up the miserable world of action and reaction, birth and death, despite its utter meaninglessness.” 2.7 tan nityatvam, tad abhave atmano vancitatvat - prapyapi durllabhataram,.manusyam vibudhepsitam yair asrito na govindas, tair atma vancitas ciram Brahma-vaivartta Purana The unsurrendered soul is perpetually deceived; thus, the state of surrender is eternal - “A birth in the human species is so valuable that it is aspired for by the demigods.

But that human birth is rendered worthless by those miserable fellows who are so proud of their bodies that they refuse to take shelter of the lotus feet of Lord Govinda.” 2.10 sarvadhamesv api mukti-datrtvam - sarvacara-vivarjitah satha-dhiyo vratya jagad-vancaka dambhahankrti-pana-paisuna-parah papantyaja nisthurah ye canye dhana-dara-putra-niratah sarvadhamas te ‘pi hi sri-govinda-padaravinda-sarana mukta bhavanti dvija Even the lowest of men are liberated by surrender - Nrsimha Purana “O twice-born, persons who are devoid of all virtuous practices, who are outcast, rogues, deceitful, audacious, egotistic, addicted to intoxicants, hotbeds of sin, malicious, cruel-natured, grossly infatuated with son, wife, wealth, etc. - even such extremely fallen persons are liberated by surrendering unto the lotus feet of Sri Govinda.” 2.11 tan nisthasya nadho-gatih - paramartham asesasya, jagatam adi karanam saranyam saranam yato, govindam navasidati Brhan-Naradiya Purana A surrendered soul never falls down - “Sri Govinda is the origin of all the universes, the Supreme Truth, and the shelter of all.

Those who devotedly take full refuge in Him cross over this insurmountable ocean of material existence.” 2.14 abhayamrta-datrtvan ca - ye sankha-cakrabja-karam hi sarnginam khagendra-ketum varadam sriyah patim samasrayante bhava-bhiti-nasanam tesam bhayam nasti vimukti-bhajam Completely vanquishing all fear, surrender bestows the life of eternal nectar - Vamana “The Lord of the Goddess of Fortune bears a conchshell, disc, lotus flower, and bow; He is the Master of Garuda, He is the vanquisher of the fear of mundane existence, He is the bestower of all benedictions. No trace of apprehension remains for those who take refuge in Him, since they qualify for positive immortality.” 2.15 sarvartha-sadhakatvam samsare ‘smin maha-ghore, moha-nidra-samakule ye harim saranam yanti, te krtartha na samsayah Brhan-Naradiya Purana A surrendered soul is successful in all endeavors - “In the dense darkness of this material world which is engulfed in ignorance and sleep, those who surrender unto the holy lotus feet of Lord Hari are successful in all their endeavors. Of this there is no doubt.” 2.16 ajitendriyanam api siva-datvam - kim durapadanam tesam, pumsam uddama-cetasam yair asritas tirtha-padas, carano vyasanatyayah Bhagavatam, 3.23.42 By surrender, even persons of uncontrolled senses attain all good fortune - “The lotus feet of Lord Hari vanquish material existence.

Their destination is the Lord’s supreme abode, never this mundane abode of calamities.” 2.19 sarvatmasritanam vivarta nivrttih - yesam sa eva bhagavan dayayed anantah sarvatmanasrita-pado yadi nirvyalikam te dustaram atitaranti ca deva-mayam naisam mamaham iti dhih sva-srgala-bhaksye Bhagavatam, 2.7.42 The illusion of bodily identification and mundane possessiveness is dispelled for the souls surrendered to the Lord in all respects - “Due to their taking shelter of His lotus feet in all respects, those persons upon whom the Infinite Supreme Lord bestows His unreserved grace surpass the insurmountable illusory energy of the Lord. He does not favor those who ascribe the conceptions of ‘I and mine’ to this material body, which is food for jackals and hounds.” 2.20 tad upeksitanam duhkha-pratikarah ksanika eva - balasya neha saranam pitarau nrsimha nartasya cagadam udanvati majjato nauh taptasya tat-pratividhir ya ihanjasestas tavad vibho tanu-bhrtam tvad-upeksitanam Bhagavatam, 7.9.19 For persons devoid of a relationship with the Supreme Lord Hari, prevention of suffering cannot but be transitory - “O Nrsimha, O Almighty Lord, precautions and remedies are only short-lived when attempted by the suffering embodied souls who are not favored by You. Parents are not the guardians of their child, medicine is not the cure for the diseased, and a boat is not the savior of a man drowning in the ocean.” 2.21 anasritanam asad avagrahad eva vividharttih - tavad bhayam dravina-deha-suhrn-nimittam sokah sprha paribhavo vipulas ca lobhah tavan mamety asad-avagraha arti-mulam yavan na te ’nghrim abhayam pravrnita lokah Bhagavatam, 3.9.6 The various tribulations of the unsurrendered souls are simply due to their obsession with the unreal - “O Lord, as long as the people of the world do not take the safe and sound shelter of Your lotus feet, they remain full of anxiety about their wealth, their bodies, and their friends; overwhelmed with lamentation, hankering, obsession, and intense greed, they cannot obtain relief from the suffering which is deeply rooted in their imaginary conceptions of I and mine.” 2.22 paripurna-kamo harir evasrayaniyo ’nyad-heyam - avismitam tam paripurna-kamam, svenaiva labhena samam prasantam vinopasarpaty aparam hi balisah, sva-langulenatititartti sindhum Bhagavatam, 6.9.22 One should take refuge in the fully self-satisfied Supreme Lord Hari; the shelter of ‘other gods’ yields a lamentably inferior result - “Lord Krsna is perfectly replete in everything desirable, fully self-sufficient, poised and tranquil. Nothing can be astonishing for Him. Only a fool disregards Him to take shelter in any demigod whose propitiation may be prescribed for the accomplishment of worldly benefits. Such a person may be compared to one who seizes a dog’s tail in order to cross the ocean.” 2.23 harer eva sarvoddharitvam · kirata-hunandhra-pulinda-pulkasa abhira-sumbha yavanah khasadayah ye ’nye ca papa yad-upasrayasrayah sudhyanti tasmai prabhavisnave namah Bhagavatam, 2.4.18 Only Sri Hari is capable of delivering the living being in all circumstances - “Persons such as those belonging to the races known as Kirata, Huna, Andhra, Pulinda, Pulkasa, Abhira, Sumbha (Kanka), Yavana, and Khasa - nay, persons of each and every sinful birth are perfectly purified without a doubt, by taking shelter of the devotees surrendered to Lord Visnu, the Almighty.

O Universal Lord, those who do not accept the joy of the shelter of Your lotus feet and pursue the paths of abstract liberation and mundane acquisition - such persons are devastated by Your deluding potency.” 2.25 krsna-carana-saranagateh parama-sadhyatvam - na naka-prstham na ca sarva-bhaumam na paramesthyam na rasadhipatyam na yoga-siddhir apunar-bhavam va vanchanti yat pada-rajah prapannah Bhagavatam, 10.16.37 Full refuge in the lotus feet of Sri Krsna is the supreme objective - “Those souls who have taken refuge in the dust of Your lotus feet have no desire to attain heaven, universal dominion, the post of Lord Brahma, sovereignty over the earth, yogic perfections, or liberation.” 2.26 hari-prapannanam anya-nistara-samarthyam-atmaramanam api hari- pada-prapattis ca - yat pada-samsrayah suta, munayah prasamayanah sadyah punanty upasprstah, svardhuny-apo ’nusevaya Bhagavatam, 1.1.15 Souls surrendered unto the lotus feet of the Lord Hari are competent to deliver others, and the fully self-satisfied souls also surrender to the Lord’s lotus feet - “The slightest association with the supremely tranquil sages who have surrendered unto the lotus feet of the Lord purifies the people of the world; but the river Ganga purifies only those who bathe in it.” 2.27 sri-krsnaika-sarana naiva vidhi-kinkarah - devarsi-bhutapta-nrnam pitrnam na kinkaro nayam rni ca rajan sarvatmana yah saranam saranyam gato mukundam parihrtya karttam Bhagavatam, 11.5.41 Those souls who have exclusively surrendered unto Krsna are not subservient to scriptural injunctions and prohibitions - “O King, one who abandons all worldly obligations and wholeheartedly surrenders unto Mukunda, the exclusive shelter of all beings in every respect - such a person is no longer indebted to the demigods, sages, other life-forms, friends and relatives, mankind, and ancestors.” 2.28 tad anugrhita veda-dharmatita eva - yada yasyanugrhnati, bhagavan atma-bhavitah sa jahati matim loke, vede ca parinisthitam Bhagavatam, 4.29.45 The recipients of the Lord’s mercy are transcendental to Vedic religiosity - “Because of the intense love of His surrendered soul, the Supreme Lord bestows His grace upon that devotee by ushering divine inspiration into his heart. Such a devotee then abandons the preoccupation with adhering to worldly obligations and Vedic religiosity.” 2.29 sri-krsna-svarupam eva paramasraya-padam - dasame dasamam laksyam, asritasraya-vigraham sri-krsnakhyam param dhama, jagad-dhama namami tat Bhavartha-dipika, Bhagavatam, 10.1.1 As the epitome of divine ecstasy (rasa), the Supreme Lord’s original form - Krsna - is the highest refuge - “In the tenth canto of Srimad-Bhagavatam, Sri Krsna has been distinguished as the embodiment of shelter for the surrendered souls.

You are the destroyer of the soul’s illusion, You are the divine wish-fulfilling tree, the refuge of all devotees. Worshippable by Siva and Virinci (Sadasiva in the form of Sri Advaita Acarya, and Brahma in the form of Haridasa Thakura), You are the shelter of all and everything, and You are the dispeller of Your devotee’s suffering which originates in offenses to the holy name (nama-aparadha). You are the only boat for crossing the ocean of this material world ofsuffering.

  <meta name="twitter:description" content="Sri Sri Prapanna-jivanamrtam The Complete Unabridged English Edition - Life-Nectar of the Surrendered Souls Positive and Progressive Immortality by the Intimate Servitor of the Illustrious Universal Preceptor of Vaisnava Thought, Vaisnava-siddhantacarya-samrat Jagad-guru Prabhupada Sri Srimad Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Goswami Maharaja: Om Visnupada Paramahamsa Parivrajakacarya-varya Sarva-sastra-siddhanta-vit Astottara-sata- Sri Srimad Bhakti Raksaka Sridhara Deva Goswami Maharaja Published by the Appointed President-Acarya Parivrajakacarya Srimad Bhakti Sundara Govinda Maharaja Rendered into English by Tridandiswami Sripada Bhakti Ananda Sagara Maharaja Preface (translated from the Publisher’s Note of the first Bengali edition) The best introduction to the author of this book is given by the work itself. Pujyapada Parivrajakacarya Tridandiswami Srimad Bhakti Raksaka Sridhara Maharaja is the fit recipient of the grace bestowed upon him by that great Universal Guru who shines like the sun among the Gaudiya Acaryas: Om Visnupada Sri Srimad Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Goswami Prabhupada. Srila Prabhupada, now left this world to join the eternal divine pastimes, is the Divine Agent to flood the world with the nectarine universal preaching of the glory of the Supreme Lord, in the Divine Succession of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Although the devotional community is well-acquainted with the illustrious personality of His Holiness B.R. Sridhara Maharaja, I may nonetheless take the opportunity to enumerate some of his glories herein for my self- purification. The brilliance of his unprecedented scholarship is found in the artful compilation and harmony of Sri Prapanna-jivanamrtam, Life Nectar of the Surrendered Souls, accurately drawn from the axiomatic teachings of pure devotion (bhakti-siddhanta-vani) as evolved by the Vaisnava preceptors in the line of the bona fide Scriptures. We have already seen the extraordinary competence of His Holiness in preaching the beautiful, illuminating conceptions of the kings of transcendental scholars - the Vaisnava Preceptors headed by Sri Rupa, Sri Sanatana, and Sri Jiva - in various languages throughout the whole of India. Upon reading the first Sanskrit poem composed by His Holiness, Sri Bhaktivinoda Viraha Dasakam, our Divine Master commented that the writing was of a happy style. Srila Prabhupada profusely praised the devotional gravity of the presentation, revealing his deep satisfaction and joyful confidence that in times to come the message of Sri Caitanyadeva would be befittingly upheld and preached by the author. Just prior to his entrance into his eternal pastimes, Srila Prabhupada, in preference to hearing devotional prayer (kirtana) performed by devotees recognized for expertise, called for His Holiness’ pure rendering of Sri Rupa-manjari pada, sei mora sampada, the worshipful prayer of the Gaudiya Vaisnavas’ most cherished ideal. The theme of Life-Nectar of the Surrendered Souls is described in the introductory first chapter, Prelude to Approaching Nectar. In some instances throughout the work, the Bengali verse interpretation of the venerated pure devotees has been fittingly given for the translation of the authentic stanzas quoted. In Words of Nectar from the Devotees, statements of the Supreme Lord have occasionally been quoted in conformation with the development of the theme. In his explanatory aphorisms that precede each stanza, the author reveals the unique axiomatic truths (siddhanta) of his Divine Succession. Doubtlessly, the good readers who know the supereminence of the Gaudiya- siddhanta - the axiomatic devotional teachings in the line of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu - will be overjoyed with His Holiness’ novel illuminations. In the epilogue, the author has mentioned his line of Divine Succession and the time and place of the writing of the book. It has been vividly illustrated herein that a life without surrender unto the lotus feet of Sri Krsna is utterly futile, and the most treasured perfection achieved through exclusive surrender has been revealed. This will especially encourage those who are aspiring to enter the land of devotion, drawing them onward to the lotus feet of Sri Hari. And it will infuse spiritual joy and exhilaration in the hearts of the established devotees. This book is the supreme wealth of the surrendered souls. Devotion for the Supreme Lord, Sri Hari-bhakti, is the singular quintessence in this world, and only by exclusive surrender, saranagati, is it happily attained. May this Life-Nectar of the Surrendered Souls graciously appear all the world over, distributing the ever-increasing aspiration to reach the abode of divine ecstasy - the lotus feet of Sri Hari. Just as the repeated rubbing of sandalwood produces more and more charming fragrance, we remain confident that the faithful devotees, whose only pleasure is in conclusive theological truth (sat-siddhanta), will experience the ambrosial devotional fragrance of this holy treatise in their spiritual discussions, and thus relish transcendental delight. We shall consider ourselves blessed when this book inevitably comes to be treasured by the august assembly of the fortunate souls. a Vaisnava’s servant’s servant, Sri Nrsimhananda Brahmacari on the holy anniversary of Srila Bhakti Siddhanta Prabhupada’s departure, Gaurabda 457 (14th January, 1944) at Sri Dhama Navadvipa All glory to the Divine Master and the Supreme Lord Sri Krsna Caitanya Publisher’s Note Sri Sri Prapanna-jivanamrtam, The Life-nectar of the Surrendered Souls, is the crown-jewel of divine literatures as the eternal elixir of life for the exclusively surrendered souls, the bestower of the perpetual relish of full-fledged nectar, and the awakening and sustaining fountainhead of life in Divine Consorthood. Indeed, who can fittingly portray her holy glory and renown? In the same way we cannot but feel ever inadequate when we attempt to sing the glories of the illustrious author, our most worshipful Divine Master, Om Visnupada Sri Srila Bhakti Raksaka Sridhara Deva Goswami Maharaja, the dearmost intimate attendant of the great pioneer pre-eminent among the Gaudiya Acaryas, Sri Gauranga’s transcendental message incarnate - Prabhupada Sri Srila Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Goswami Thakura. Even without world itineracy, the seat of Universal Guru (Jagad-guru) of the world’s renowned gurus has been gracefully won by Srila Sridhara Deva Goswami Maharaja while presiding in the grand, noble distinction of his venerable years of devotional life at the Sri Chaitanya Saraswat Math of Nabadwip, his exclusive, personal holy place of bhajana. Since its first printing, which was in Bengali, this sublime literature has brought heartfelt satisfaction to the stalwart devotees of the highest order, being hailed by them as an Essential Scripture to be unfailingly sung and cultivated as a daily devotional function in spiritual life, as is customarily practiced with the Holy Scriptures such as the Srimad Bhagavad-gita. In both the Eastern and Western countries, its English publication will doubtlessly be similarly worshiped with the utmost reverence, constantly studied and sung with devotion by the surrendered souls of fine theistic intellect, and by the noble souls engaged in their divine search for the Supreme Lord. This monumental work was originally composed in the Sanskrit language. The authentic Bengali translation that was sanctioned by the author is extremely developed, profoundly exploring the heart of the book; scholars who know the internal conclusive scriptural purports can alone realize how difficult is its translation and publication into English. However, by the boundless mercy of the most magnanimous Supreme Lord Sri Caitanyacandra, the fountainhead of all incarnations of Godhead, and by the causeless grace of His most beloved, our Divine Master, and the pure devotees whose hearts are absorbed in divine love - this formidable task has now been fulfilled. Thus, I again and again worship the holy lotus feet of Them all. For their tireless efforts to usher in the Advent of the present edition in its perfectly elegant form, all those Godbrothers and Godsisters who served in the various facets of the publication have attained the unending graces of our Divine Master and the Vaisnavas. They have bound us in eternal gratitude. For executing the task of the English translation, proofing, and editing, special mention is due to Tridandiswami Sripada Bhakti Ananda Sagara Maharaja, assisted by Sriman Nimaisundara Brahmacari Vidyavinoda. And for their dedicated effort in securing the necessary funds and assistance for the printing and publishing of the work in a most dignified presentation, special mention is due to Sripada Dayadhara Gauranga Dasa Brahmacari Bhakti Prabhakara Prabhu and all the good devotees assisting him. In conclusion, invoking the charming verse of Sri Gurupadapadma this humble servant earnestly prays at his holy lotus feet that this crownjewel of Sacred Writings, Sri Sri Prapanna-jivanamrtam, may remain with Her merciful presence in every land, in every home, and in every heart. And in Her gracious acquiescence, may She acknowledge the glorious victory of Her goodwill by churning and overflooding the entire living universe with Her supramundane wave of ecstatic love, to bless all souls with the supreme good fortune. sri-srimad-bhagavat-padambuja-madhu-svadotsavaih sat-padair niksipta madhu-bindavas ca parito bhrasta mukhat gunjitaih yatnaih kincid ihahrtam nija-parasreyo ‘rthina tan maya bhuyobhuya ito rajamsi pada-samlagnani tesam bhaje “The bees, intoxicated in the festival of drinking the honey of the Lord’s lotus feet, busily humming the glories of the Lord, drops of honey from their mouths fall and scatter all around; for my divine prospect, I’ve carefully collected some of those drops herein - and thus do I worship the dust of the holy lotus feet of those saints, again and again.” I beg to remain most humbly, Tridandi-bhiksu Sri Bhakti Sundara Govinda 16 October, 1987 93rd Holy Appearance Day of His Divine Grace Srila Bhakti Raksaka Sridhara Deva Goswami Maharaja This Divine Book was prepared and presented to the Lotus Hands of the Venerable Author by his disciples and aspiring servitors on the celebrated appearance day of Lord Gauracandra, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, March 3, 1988 All glory to the Divine Master and the Supreme Lord Sri Krsna Caitanya Foreword Because the soul is a particle of consciousness, it is endowed with free will. Eliminating free will, only gross matter remains. Without independence, the soul could not progress from bondage to liberation, and his ultimate salvation would have been impossible. But his spirit of exploitation is a foreign force, an intoxicant - a miscalculation that surrounds his independence. Life’s objectives may be scientifically analyzed as threefold: exploitation, renunciation, and dedication. The most common tendency is in those engaged in exploiting other persons, species, or elements, for mundane sense enjoyment. They desire to materially elevate themselves in the present environment, and thus they are described as elevationists. A more sober class discover the severe equal and opposite reactions to worldly pursuits, and they engage in renunciation of the world, in search of an equilibrium comparable to a deep, dreamless slumber. By being unawake to the world, they hope to escape its concomitant reactions and sufferings. Thus their goal is liberation, and they are known as salvationists or liberationists. But through the correct interpretation of the Revealed Scriptures by learned votaries such as Sri Sanatana Goswami, Sri Jiva Goswami, and Sri Ramanuja, the devotees of divinity know the pursuits of both exploitation and renunciation as not only fruitless, but injurious to real progress. The normal, wholesome, and happy plane is in the life of dedication. Without exploiting or borrowing anything from the environment, and without attempting to artificially renounce it, one who is sincere to dedicate himself naturally comes into contact with a higher and more subtle plane of life. By his readiness to give and serve, he will attain to a higher society and achieve an appropriate master. The enjoying spirit forces one to be associated with a lower section to control and enjoy. And the renouncing spirit allures even the scholars with its ‘prestigious’ superiority over exploitation. Thus it is more dangerous, just as a half-truth is more dangerous than falsehood. As it is difficult to awaken someone from the deepest possible sleep, the liberationists may remain for incalculable time within their cell of non-differentiated liberation. But the higher existence will invite the service of one who desires to purely dedicate himself without remuneration. Seva - service, dedication, is the summum bonum of the teachings of the Vaisnava school, the third plane of life where every unit is a dedicating member in an organic whole. In such a normal adjustment, everyone mutually assists one another in their service to the center, the higher recipient, the highest entity. Everything is existing to satisfy Him, because He must possess this qualification to be the Absolute. He is the prime cause of all causes - and everything exists for Him, to satisfy Him. A barren conception of mere ‘deathlessness’ cannot afford us any knowledge of a positive thing, but only freedom from the negative side. If immortality means ’no influence of mortality,’ what, then, is its positive conception? What will be the nature, movement, and progress of that which is immortal? Without this understanding immortality is only an abstract idea. Because it does not appear to exhibit the symptoms of death, stone would be ‘more immortal’ than human beings, and conscious entities would be ‘mortal,’ forever denied immortality! What, then, is the positive conception of immortality? How are the immortal ‘immortal’? What is the positive reality in immortality? How can one become immortal? One must search out his intrinsic location in the universal order. It will not do to attempt to solve only the negative side of life which is full of suffering - birth, death, infirmity, and disease. We should know that there exists a conception of life worth living for. This positive side has been almost totally neglected in general religious views. The ‘immortality’ professed by the schools of Buddha and Sankaracarya yields no positive life. Their goals are maha-nirvana and brahma-sayujya respectively. The Buddhist theory is that after liberation, nothing remains. They crave absolute extinction of material existence (prakrti-nirvana). And the Sankarite monist theory of liberation is to lose one’s individuality by ‘becoming one’ with the non-differentiated aspect of the Absolute. That is, they crave extinction in Brahman (brahma- nirvana). They postulate that when the triad of seer, seen, and seeing (drasta-drsya-darsana), or knower, knowable, and knowledge (jnata- jneya-jnana) culminate at one point, the triad is destroyed (triputi- vinasa) and nothing remains. Material action and reaction ceases in Viraja, the river of passivity, which is located at the uppermost edge of this illusory (mayika) world. And above Viraja is the destination of the Sankarites - the ‘abscissa’ stage or the non-differentiated plane of Brahman, called Brahmaloka, which is located at the lowest edge of the spiritual realm. Both are vague areas of ,negative immortality.’ Brahmaloka is a marginal or ‘buffer’ state midway between the material and spiritual worlds. Composed of innumerable souls, it is an immortal plane devoid of specific variegatedness (nirvisesa). It possesses positivity only in the sense that it is a plane of existence, a background (kastha), but in itself it lacks positive development of variegated existence (kala). The nature of the background is oneness, and development woven over it necessitates plurality or a differentiated nature (kala-kasthadi rupena parinama- pradayini - Candi, Markandeya Purana). In the Bhagavad-gita (15.16), mutable (ksara) and immutable (aksara) existences are described, representing the personal and the impersonal, the development and the basis, or differentiated and non- differentiated conceptions of general existence. The mutable is represented by the multitude of embodied living beings, while the immutable aspect is the great expanse of the all-accommodating Absolute, the Brahman (8.3). In the analysis of worldly action, the most subtle form of unfructified past action, prior to the present tendency (the seedling stage) to sin, has been defined (Bhakti-rasamrita-sindhu, Purva 1.23) as unknowable, indistinct, and of untraceable origin (kuta). The immutable Brahman aspect of the Absolute is similarly defined as being one-dimensional - undetectable, unspecific, and of no definite color, sound, or taste; an unknown and unknowable ‘un-understandable’ stage of existence (kuta). But the Supreme Lord, Krsna, is above both the mutable and immutable existences, and thus His glories are sung throughout the Vedas and in the world as the Purusottama, the Supreme Personality (Bhagavad-gita, 15.18). Sri Sukadeva Goswami affirms that in the most remote and distant plane, Lord Krsna is to be found: everywhere is He - the fountainhead of all conceptions (vidura-kasthaya, Bhagavatam, 2.4.14). He cannot be eliminated. Thus, the ‘immortality’ of the impersonalistic schools such as Buddhists, Sankarites, etc., offers no positive life. But in Vaisnavism, immortality is positive, dynamic existence. Above the non-differentiated Brahman aspect of the Absolute, the transcendental, variegated existence begins in the first glimpse of the spiritual sky, the plane known as Paravyoma (Chaitanya-charitamrita, Madhya 19.153). Situated there in the spiritual plane is the positive Kingdom of God: firstly Vaikuntha, then Ayodhya, Dvaraka, Mathura, and finally, above all, Goloka. Transcending the vague areas of ’negative immortality’ that the impersonalists aspire for, the devotees - the Vaisnavas - dedicate themselves to the life of eternal devotional service to the Supreme Lord of the transcendental realm (Bhagavad-gita, 18.54). Although the soul can maladopt himself to a fallen state of existence in the planes of exploitation and renunciation, he is inherently adoptable to the positive life in the Kingdom of God. And fully blossomed, he reaches the realm of Goloka (svarupe sabara haya golokete sthiti - Sri Sri Krsnera Astottara-sata-nama). Sri Prapanna-jivanamrtam: amrta means ‘undying,’ or ’nectar,’ and jivana means ’life.’ Positive immortality is possible only for the surrendered (prapannanam). All others are necessarily mortal. Only those who have wholly given themselves to the center are living in eternality. Surrender is fully established in its excellence and its constant position. Yet there is variegatedness within that constancy, in the form of progressive movement, or pastimes (vilasa). The Supreme Absolute Personality being infinitely superior to both the mutable “mortals’ and the immutable “immortal’ (negative) Brahman, only the svarupa-siddha souls - those who are perfectly established in their divine relationship with Him - are eternally freed from the disease of mutation and mortality ( svarupena-vyavasthitih Bhagavatam, 2. 10.6). With a broad vision, we must know ourselves as created of smaller stuff, and thus only with assistance from above can we improve our situation and achieve a position in the higher plane. A submissive, serving attitude is necessary in us. If we submit, the universal dictatorial aspect of the Absolute will take us upward to a higher prospect. He is the autocrat, the absolute knowledge, the absolute good - everything about Him is absolute. Being in a vulnerable position as we experience in this world, why, then, should we not submit to Him? The road to the sphere of transcendence (adhoksaja) is the deductive or descending method (avaroha-pantha). We can reach the absolute good, the absolute will, by His consent alone. Only by faith in absolute surrender is anyone allowed entry into that domain, never by ,exploration,’ by,colonization,’ or by attempting to become a,monarch’ there. No inductive or ascending method (aroha-pantha) such as renunciation or yoga, etc., can compel Him to accept us. Whosoever He chooses can alone reach Him (Svetasvataropanisad, 6.23). Although the highest point of the renunciates is desirelessness or freedom from possessiveness, the surrendered soul (saranagata) is naturally desireless ( akincana, Chaitanya-charitamrita, Madhya 22.99). Detachment is only the negative side of surrender, and above selflessness, the devotee surrenders himself to the higher substance, and this is to be awake in another world, another plane of life. Such is the positive, Vaisnavaconception of life - to determine one’s real self beyond the jurisdiction of the world of misconception. The nature of the progressive substance is eternal existence, knowledge, and beauty (sac-cid-ananda). The one harmonizing organic whole (advaya-jnana-tattva) contains all similarities and differences, held inconceivably in the hand of the Absolute (acintya-bhedabheda- tattva). And there is no anarchy in the absolute power. Nonetheless, mercy is found to be above justice. Above judiciousness, the supreme position is held by love, sympathy, and beauty: ‘I am the absolute power, but I am friendly to you all. Knowing this, you need never fear (Bhagavad-gita, 5.29).’ This revelation relieves us of all apprehension: we are not victims of a chaotic environment, but it is judicious, considerate - and the ultimate dispenser is our friend. Sri Jiva Goswami has stated that of the six symptoms of surrender, to embrace the guardianship of the Lord (goptrtve varanam) is central, since total surrender expresses the same ideal. The remaining five symptoms of accepting the favorable, rejecting the unfavorable, faith in the Lord’s protection, full self-surrender, and humility, are natural contributing associate-servitors to the ideal (angangi-bhedena sad-vidha; tatra ‘goptrtve varanam’ evangi, saranagati-sabdenaikarthyat; anyani tv angani tat parikaratvat - Bhakti-sandarbha, 236). Surrender is the foundation of the world of devotion. It is the very life and essence. One cannot enter into that domain without surrender. It must be present in every form of service, and to attempt divine service without it will be mere imitation or a lifeless formality. The entire gist of the Vedic instruction is to dedicate oneself to the service of the Lord. In his commentary of Srimad-Bhagavatam, Sri Sridhara Swamipada has stated that only if the practices of devotion are initially offered to the Supreme Lord can they be recognized as devotion. To attempt to execute them and subsequently offer them cannot be pure devotion (iti nava laksanani yasyah sa, adhitena ced bhagavati visnau bhaktih kriyate, sa carpitaiva sati yadi kriyeta, na tu krta sati pascad arpyeta) Without surrender, the activity will be adulterated with exploitation, renunciation, artificial meditation (karma, jnana,yoga), and so on. By constitution, the soul is the Lord’s servant, and the Lord has the right to make or mar, to do anything according to His sweet will. If accepting this truth we undertake the devotional practices such as hearing, chanting, remembering, and worshipping, only then will our activity be devotional. Only the activity of the self-dedicated soul can be devotion. Sincere prayer will help us to seek the help of the Lord, but, again, prayer in the spirit of surrender can alone reach Him (Saranagati, 1.5). The path of devotion entails increasing our negative status to invite the positive to descend and embrace us: ‘I am very low, and You are so high. You can purify me, take me and utilize me for Your higher purpose. Be pleased. Otherwise I am helpless, neglected.’ It is impossible to take Him captive in the cage of our knowledge. Only the way of devotion can help us. In every respect He is high, great, and infinite - and we are similarly small. His mercy - His sympathy, love, and grace, are the only medium through which we can come together. And good faith is autonomous in that sweet land which is so high that we will earnestly hope and pray for the association of the higher existence as His slave; and that also will be our happy prospect for the future. Krsna is not within our purview, and thus we are always recommended by Scriptures and saints to approach the bona fide Divine Master and Vaisnavas. To satisfy the Supreme Lord, the criterion is to satisfy our Gurudeva: if Gurudeva is dissatisfied with us, the Lord is surely dissatisfied. An analogy has been cited in the Scriptures where the Lord is compared to the sun, the Guru to a pond, and the disciple to a lotus flower. If the pond withdraws, the very sun will scorch and dry up the lotus - and the lotus will be cheered by the sun as long as the water supports and surrounds it. Yasya prasadad bhagavat prasado, yasyaprasadan na gatih kuto ‘pi, dhyayam stavams tasya yasas tri- sandhyam, vande guroh sri-caranaravindam (Gurvastakam, 8): ‘I bow down to the lotus feet of Sri Gurudeva. By his grace we achieve the grace of Krsna; without his grace, we are lost. Therefore, at daybreak, noon, and evening, we meditate upon and sing the glories of Sri Gurudeva, and pray for his mercy.’ The Vaisnava Guru’s dealings with the disciple are all grace, and his grace is his will to extend his wealth to the disciple. His instruction is the medium of asserting his will, which is service for the satisfaction of the Lord. And by service, we invite his grace. By an earnest desire to serve, we draw his sympathy and his willing extension of goodwill to encourage us in our relationship with the supreme entity. Firstly, surrender: we must offer him exclusive respect (pranipata), otherwise we shall not allow ourselves to approach him. Secondly, we may make our sincere and substantial inquiry (pariprasna). In a surrendered spirit, we may hear our Divine Master’s messages which he delivers to us from his venerated seat, the Vyasasana. In that conducive setting, the proper inspiration and dictation may fortuitously come down to us. And finally, to render service (sevaya) enables us to taste the essence (Bhagavad-gita, 4.34). On the instruction of his Gurudeva Devarsi Narada, Vyasadeva had to undergo a progressive development (Bhagavatam, 1.5). Narada is established in non-calculative devotion (jnana-sunya-bhakti, or jnana- vimukta-bhakti-paramah ), and above Narada is Uddhava, who is established in exclusive divine love for Krsna (premaika-nisthah). Until one reaches Goloka, where there is full-fledged Krsna conception, all other stages may be changeable. There is no further change when one is firmly established in his serving relationship with the Original Lord (svayam-bhagavan), Krsna. In the narrative of Brhad-Bhagavatamrtam, Gopakumara passes through Vaikuntha, Ayodhya, Mathura, Dvaraka, and then he finally arrives in Vrndavana. There, his particular divine relationship with the Lord firmly culminates in friendship (sakhya-rasa). For him, the previous stages were passing, although for others a permanent relationship may occur in one of them. They are progressive stages of,positive immortality.’ On the banks of the Godavari river, in progressively deeper and deeper planes, the entirety of theological development was expressed in the conversation between Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu and Sri Ramananda Raya. A positive hierarchy of divine relationships with the Lord exists in progressive stages for the various types of devotees ( karmibhyah … kah krti, Upadesamritam, 10), each type having its characteristic central relationship (vaikunthaj … viveki na kah, Upadesamritam, 9). In the divine realm, the depth and degree of surrender may also be measured according to the science of mellows (rasa-tattva): peacefulness, servitorship, friendship, parenthood, and consorthood (santa-, dasya-, sakhya-, vatsalya-and madhura-rasa) are the natural divisions, each consecutively of a finer layer. And higher than even the direct consorthood of the Godhead is the most elevated of the entire compass of devotional services - the divine service of the Supreme Predominated Moiety (Sri Radha-dasya). According to the intensity of surrender - to the point of no return - the quality of the magnitude of truth encountered may be measured. The inner sweetness of the truth and its infinite characteristic attracts the devotees’ hearts to the highest degree, so much that they never feel any satisfaction of achievement in what is actually the acme of their highest fortune. In Vaikuntha, only peacefulness and servitorship are present, with a hint of friendship. If we commit the offense of giving more attention to law than to love, we will be ‘cast down’ from Goloka to Vaikuntha: Goloka is the land of love, and there the inhabitants know nothing more. And by love is meant self-sacrifice and self-forgetfulness for the service of Krsna, without a care for one’s good or bad future - total risk in the extreme. In his Bhakti-sandarbha, Sri Jiva Goswami defines ‘Bhagavan,’ the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as more than ‘Lord Narayana of Vaikuntha, the most powerful in all phases.’ Above that, His existence, appearance, and nature attracts everyone to serve Him, love Him, and die for Him (bhajaniya-guna-visista). His qualification is so beautiful. Thus, the highest conception of the Godhead is the Krsna conception, and He can be known by the devotees in Krsna consciousness. Those who serve and worship the Supreme Lord according to the scriptural regulation and calculation belong to the category of Vaikuntha worship. In Vaikuntha, in the initial transcendental conscious conception (adhoksaja), the Godhead as Lord Narayana accepts reverential service in His Majestic Dignity. But the devotees of the highest order are exclusively surrendered to the service of Lord Krsna with their innermost love and faith. The Krsna conception of Goloka Vrndavana is corroborated in the Srimad Bhagavatam, which is the greatest interpretation of the Vedic Scriptures. And Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu is known to be Krsna Himself, united with His highest potency, Sri Radha. Mahaprabhu Sri Caitanyadeva has clearly revealed that the genuine interpretation and purpose of all the Revealed Scriptures is to faithfully guide us to the highest goal: the domain of love and unconditional surrender unto the central power of truth, personified in Lord Krsna as beauty and affection. Not power, but affection is the highest force to attract us all. Consciously or unconsciously, the absolute position is held by love and affection, and love is superior to all power and knowledge. It is the real fulfillment of the inner heart. Our inner existence wants only love, beauty, and affection - neither knowledge nor power. The finite cannot capture the infinite, but the infinite can make Himself known to the finite. And when the infinite appears as a member of the finite land, the highest gain of the finite is achieved. Krsna carries His father’s shoes, and He cries when chastised by His mother. Through love, the Absolute comes down to the finite. The infinite’s most intimate approach to the finite is found in Vrndavana. The infinite comes to embrace the finite in its fullest capacity (aprakrta), mixing with finite things so closely that people cannot perceive the Lord’s transcendental Godly character as the Divinity. We, the infinitesimal souls, can attain our greatest fortune when the infinite comes to us in His highest approach - as if He were one of us! His approach is so merciful, so great, so intimate, and so perfect. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, who is sweetness and magnanimity combined, openly announced that we are all natural slaves of the highest entity (Chaitanya-charitamrita, Madhya 20.108). But this is slavery to the great force of love and beauty. It is the greatest fortune to be utilized in any way by the absolute existence, knowledge, and beauty - to be in harmony with the highest center. No one is forced or barred but this is the soul’s intrinsic nature. Faithfully in the Divine Succession from Nitya-lila-pravista Om Visnupada Paramahamsa Astottara-sata Sri Srimad Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Goswami Prabhupada, especially inspired by the divine message of Srila Thakura Bhaktivinoda’s Saranagati, and attending the authentic Gaudiya Vaisnava literatures such as Sri Hari-bhakti-vilasa and Bhakti-sandarbha as well as the writings of other Authorized Divine Successions such as the Ramanuja Sampradaya - this Sri Sri Prapanna- jivanamrtam has been compiled in order to supply the devotees’ spiritual sustenance and nourishment. Surrender is the indispensable necessity in the life of a devotee, and Life-Nectar of the Surrendered Souls will sustain and fortify the surrendered souls as the nectar in their lives of Positive and Progressive Immortality. 1.1 Chapter 1 Upakramamrtam - Prelude to Approaching Nectar atha mangalacaranam - sri-guru-gaura-gandharva-, govindanghrin ganaih saha vande prasadato yesam, sarvarambhah subhankarah Auspicious invocation - I make my obeisance unto the lotus feet of my Divine Master, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, Sri Sri Gandharva-Giridhari (Sri Sri Radha and Krsna), and Their associates. By Their grace, all endeavors are successful. 1.2 gaura-vag-vigraham vande, gaurangam gaura-vaibhavam gaura-sankirtanonmattam, gaura-karunya-sundaram I make my obeisance unto the Deity, Gaura-Saraswati - the personified message of the Golden Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu - whose bodily luster is of a beautiful golden hue, like that of the selfsame Lord Gaurasundara; who is the personal expansion of that Supreme Lord Gaurahari; who is always intoxicated by preaching the message of that Golden Lord; and whose divine beauty blooms in the revelation of Lord Gauranga’s mercy potency. (This is the fundamental meaning of the verse. Within the scope of the Sanskrit language, various expanded purports may be drawn from the original.) 1.3 guru-rupa-harim gauram, radha-ruci-rucavrtam nityam naumi navadvipe, nama-kirtana-nartanaih Perpetually do I sing the glories of Lord Gauranga, who is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Sri Hari, embraced by the heart and halo of Sri Radhika, and who has descended as the Divine Master. In this holy abode of Sri Navadvipa Dhama, He is absorbed in the pastimes of profusely chanting the holy names, dancing in ecstasy. (As with verse two, expanded purports may be drawn from this verse.) 1.4 srimat-prabhu-padambhoja-, madhupebhyo namo namah trpyantu krpaya te ’tra, prapanna-jivanamrte Again and again I make my obeisance unto the eternal personal servitors of my Divine Master, who drink the nectar of his lotus feet. I pray they may be graciously pleased in tasting this Life-Nectar of the Surrendered Souls. 1.5 atma-vijnaptih - aty-arvacina-rupo ‘pi, pracinanam susammatan slokan katipayan atra, caharami satam mude A humble petition - Despite my disqualifications, for the satisfaction of the pure devotees I have compiled in this book an anthology of stanzas that are well established by our predecessors. 1.6 tad-vag-visargo janatagha-viplavo yasmin prati-slokam abaddhavaty api namany anantasya yaso ’nkitani yat srnvanti gayanti grnanti sadhavah “Even if every stanza is imperfectly composed, that is, unlucidly expressed, the sins of the people are totally vanquished by those expressions or books in which the glorious holy names of the Infinite Supreme Lord are described - since the pure devotees hear those holy names (from a qualified preacher), they solitarily sing those holy names (even in the absence of others), and they chant the unending glories of those holy names (in the presence of a deserving listener).” 1.7 abhivyakta mattah prakrti-laghu-rupad api budha vidhatri siddharthan hari-gunamayi vah krtir iyam pulindenapy agnih kim u samidham unmathya janito hiranya-sreninam apaharati nantah kalusatam “O learned personalities, this treatise, composed of the divine qualities of Lord Hari, will fulfill your cherished wishes despite the fact that it is presented by me, a very insignificant person. Does not the fire ignited from pieces of wood rubbed together by a low-born barbarian dissipate the impurities in gold?” 1.8 yathokta rupa-padena, nicenotpadite ’nale hemnah suddhis tathaivatra, viraharti-hrtih satam As Srila Rupa Goswamipada has (in his humility) expressed that gold can be purified with fire lit by a barbarian, similarly, the pure devotees’ grief born of their separation from the Lord may also be dispelled by this book (which will light the lamp of their divine love for the Lord). 1.9 antah kovi-yasas-kamam, sadhutavaranam bahih sudhyantu sadhavah sarve, duscikitsyam imam janam O saintly devotees, please purify this wrongdoer who on the pretext of saintliness desires in his heart the prestige of a poet, and who is thus afflicted with the practically incurable disease of insincerity. 1.10 krsna-gatha-priya bhakta, bhakta-gatha-priyo harih kathancid ubhayor atra, prasangas tat prasidatam Tidings of Lord Krsna are naturally very dear to the devotees, and tidings of the Lord’s devotees are also dear to Him. Since narratives of both the Supreme Lord and His devotees can be found within this book, I have hope, O pure devotees, that you may be propitiated hereby. 1.11 svabhava-krpaya santo, mad uddesya-malinatam samsodhyang ikurudhvam bho, hy ahaituka krpabdhayah O pure devotees, by your natural divine grace, kindly purify me of ill motives (offenses) and accept this treatise.

It is the panacea of the heart and spiritual senses, bestowing those dedicated devotees’ mutual happiness by the ever-increasingly newer and newer play of supramundane joy (aprakrta-rasa). Lord Krsna and His associates are portrayed in their natural pastimes of separation and union, and the line of unconditional surrender as established by Scriptures and saints has been elucidated. 1.15-22 atra cananya-cittanam, krsna-pada-rajojusam krsna-pada-prapannanam, krsnarthe ‘khila-karmanam krsna-premaika-lubdhanam, krsnocchistaika jivinam krsna-sukhaika-vanchanam, krsna-kinkara-sevinam krsna-viccheda-dagdhanam, krsna-sangollasadd-hrdam krsna-svajana-bandhunam, krsnaika-dayitatmanam bhaktanam hrdayodghati-, marma-gathamrtena ca bhaktarti-hara-bhaktasa-, bhista-purtikaram tatha sarva-samsaya-cchedi-hrd-, granthi-bhij jnana-bhasitam apurva-rasa-sambhara-, camatkarita-cittakam viraha-vyadhi-santapta-, bhakta-citta-mahausadham yuktayuktam parityajya, bhaktarthakhila-cestitam atma-pradana-paryanta-, pratijnantah-pratisrutam bhakta-premaika-vasya-sva-, svarupollasa-ghositam purnasvasakaram saksat, govinda-vacanamrtam samahrtam pibantu bhoh, sadhavah suddha-darsanah Carefully compiled in this book is the nectar of the deep, heartrevealing transcendental messages of those devotees whose hearts are unalloyed; who are servitors of the dust of the lotus feet of Krsna; who perform their every act for Krsna; who are filled with insatiable desire exclusively in love of Krsna and sustain their lives on Krsna’s remnants alone; who desire only Krsna’s pleasure andserve the servants of Krsna; whose hearts burn in separation of Krsna and overflow with ecstasy in the association of Krsna; whose relative and friend is Krsna; and whose one and only beloved is Krsna. Along with these expressions of the devotees are carefully collected the words of supreme nectar - springing directly from the lotus mouth of Lord Govinda - which vanquish the heartbreak of the devotees; which fulfill the devotee’s hopes and earnest aspirations; which destroy all doubt and sever the knot of ignorance; which are dazzling with transcendental wisdom and astonish the heart by miraculous waves of divine rapture, which are the great panacea for the devotee’s heart afflicted with the piercing pangs of separation; which are incited wholly for the devotee irrespective of his qualification or disqualification, so much so, that the Lord is bound by His pledge to give Himself to His devotee; and which openly proclaim with great ecstasy that His very nature is to be subjugated solely by the affection of His devotee, reassuring His devotees in all circumstances. O pure and spotless devotees, may you drink deeply the quintessence of these divine elixirs. 1.23 adhyaya-paricayah - atraiva prathamadhyaye, upakramamrtabhidhe mangalacaranan catma-, vijnaptir vastu-nirnayah grantha-paricayo ‘dhyaya-, visayas ca nivesitah Chapter summary - An auspicious invocation, a humble petition, an introduction to the book and its chapters, and the theme of the philosophy of the book have, to the best of my ability, all been entered within this first chapter named Upakramamrtam or Prelude to Approaching Nectar. 1.24 dvitiyadhyayake nama, sri-sastra-vacanamrte prapatti-visaya nana-, sastroktih sannivesita In the second chapter, entitled Sri Sastra-vacanamrtam, The Nectar of Scriptural Word, various scriptural quotations regarding surrender to the Supreme Lord have been compiled. 1.25 trtiyato ‘stamam yavat, sri-bhakta-vacanamrte prapattih sad-vidha prokta, bhagavata-ganodita Chapters three to eight inclusive are entitled Sri Bhakta- vacanamrtam, Words of Nectar from the Devotees. Beautifully expressed by the lotus lips of the pure devotees of the Lord, many stanzas describing the six limbs of exclusive surrender are quoted therein. 1.26-27 anakulyasya sankalpah, pratikulya-vivarjanam raksisyatiti visvaso, goptrtve varanam tatha atma-niksepa karpanye, sad-vidha saranagatih evam paryayatas casminn, ekaikadhyaya-sangrahah These six chapters have been compiled, each consecutively dealing with the six limbs of surrender, which are as follows: 1. To accept everything favorable for devotion to Krsna 2. To reject everything unfavorable for devotion to Krsna 3. To be confident that Krsna will grant His protection 4. To embrace Krsna’s guardianship 5. To offer oneself unto Him 6. To consider oneself lowly and bereft 1.28 adhyaye navame nama, bhagavad-vacanamrte slokamrtam samahrtam, saksad-bhagavatoditam In the ninth chapter entitled Sri Bhagavad-vacanamrtam, Words of Nectar from the Supreme Lord, nectarean stanzas emanating directly from the lotus mouth of the Supreme Lord have been compiled. 1.29 dasame caramadhyaye, cavasesamrtabhidhe guru-krsna-smrtau grantha-, syopasamharanam krtam Absorbed in thought of the Divine Master and Lord Sri Krsna, the tenth and final chapter entitled Sri Avasesamrtam, The Divine Remnants of Nectar, was composed as the epilogue of the book. 1.30 uddhrta-sloka-purve tu, tad artha-suprakasakam vakyan ca yatnatas tatra, yatha-jnanam nivesitam Prior to each stanza quoted, an aphorism illuminating its inner purport has been carefully entered according to my best insight. 1.31 bhagavad-gauracandranam, vadanendu-sudhatmika bhaktoktair vesita sloka, bhakta-bhavodita yatah Being revealed by the Lord Himself adopting the heart of a devotee, the stanzas of pure nectar emanating from the moon of Sri Gauracandra have been entered along with the stanzas of the devotees. 1.32 prapattya saha cananya-, bhakter naikatya-hetutah ananya-bhakti-sambandham, bahu-vakyam ihoddhrtam Many expressions of exclusive devotion (ananya-bhakti) have been recorded herein, since exclusive devotion is most intimately related to surrender. 1.33 bhagavad-bhakta-sastranam, sambandho ‘sti parasparam tat tat pradhanyato namnam, prabbeda-karanam smrtam Actually, Words of Nectar from the Supreme Lord, Words of Nectar from the Devotees, and The Nectar of Scriptural Word are all seen to be interrelated. Still, they have been portrayed separately due to their individual importance. 1.34 praty-adhyaya-visesas tu, tatra tatraiva vaksyate mahajana-vicarasya, kincid alocyate ‘dhuna The unique characteristic of each chapter will be accordingly expressed therein. Now (in this respect), we may have some general deliberation, in the line of the great devotees of the Lord. 1.35 vastu-nirnayah - bhagavad-bhaktitah sarvam, ity utsrjya vidher api kainkaryam krsna-padaika-, srayatvam saranagatih Theme of the work - Being governed by the faith that all success is achieved by serving the Supreme Lord, to abandon servitude to even scriptural injunctions and take exclusive refuge in the lotus feet of Sri Krsna in every time, place, and circumstance, is known as saranagati - unconditional surrender. 1.36 sarvantaryamitam drstva, hareh sambandhato ‘khile aprthag-bhava-tad-drstih, prapattir jnana-bhaktitah Some consider saranagati to be that God consciousness which is realization of the one non-differentiated nature in all beings and objects, by seeing the Supreme Lord as the indwelling Supersoul of everything. However, such a conception falls within the category of calculative devotion (jnana-bhakti). It is not in the line of unadulterated pure devotion (suddha-bhakti). 1.37 nityatvan caiva sastresu, prapatter jnayate budhaih aprapannasya nr-janma-, vaiphalyoktes tu nityata By scriptural reference, the learned know of the eternality of surrender to the Lord, since the futility of human life without that surrender is elucidated therein. In this way, the eternal constitution of surrender is established. 1.38 nanyad icchanti tat pada-, rajah-prapanna-vaisnavah kincid apiti tat tasyah, sadhyatvam ucyate budhaih Because the devotees who have surrendered unto the dust of the lotus feet of the Lord never aspire for anything else whatsoever, the learned affirm that surrender is the attainable goal of all endeavors. 1.39 bhava-duhkha-vinasas ca, para-nistara-yogyata param padam prapattyaiva, krsna-sampraptir eva ca Only by surrender to the Lord can one gain freedom from the miseries of birth, death, disease, and infirmity; fitness to deliver others from those miseries; the holy abode of Lord Visnu; and the devotional service of Lord Krsna. 1.40 sravana-kirtanadinam, bhakty-anganam hi yajane aksamasyapi sarvaptih, prapattyaiva harav iti Everything is accomplished by surrendering unto the lotus feet of Sri Hari, even for one who is unable to execute the integral practices of devotional service based on hearing and chanting. 1.41 sakhya-rasasrita-praya, seti kecit vadanti tu madhuryadau prapannanam, praveso nasti ceti na Some claim that surrender is generally in the relationship of friendship (sakhya-rasa). But it is complete fallacy to think that surrendered souls have no entrance into divine relationships headed by consorthood (madhura-rasa). 1.42 sakrt pravrtti-matrena, prapattih sidhyatiti yat lobhotpadana-hetos tad, alocana-prayojanam Since surrender is achieved by turning to the refuge of the Lord just once, we should earnestly discuss the subject to enable the longing for surrender to be born in us. 1.43 api tad anakulyadi-, sankalpady-anga-laksanat tad anusilaniyatvam, ucyate hi mahajanaih Furthermore, since the constituent parts of surrender - based on acceptance of the favorable and rejection of the unfavorable - have been referred to by authorities and cited in the Scriptures, the great devotees of the Lord teach us the necessity of studying and culturing the art of surrender. 1.44 bhavarti-pidyamano va, bhakti-matrabhilasy api vaimukhya-badhyamano ’nya-, gatis tac charanam vrajet One who is severely afflicted by fear of living in the material world, or, one who, despite having an aspiration for the Lord’s service is nonetheless bound with adversity - such persons, finding no alternative, surrender to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. 1.45 asrayantara-rahitye, vanyasraya-visarjane ananya-gati-bhedas tu, dvi-vidhah parikirtitah The state of finding no other alternative occurs in two ways: in the event of having no other shelter, or in the event of abandoning one’s existing shelter. 1.46 mano-vak-kaya-bhedac ca, tri-vidha saranagatih tasam sarvanga-sampanna, sighram purna-phala-prada nyunadhikyena caitasam, taratamyam phale ‘pi ca One surrenders by thought, word, and deed. Complete surrender in all these aspects promptly affords full success. Otherwise, the fruit attained will be proportionate to the degree of one’s surrender. 1.47 apurva-phalatvam - vinasya sarva-duhkhani, nija-madhurya-varsanam karoti bhagavan bhakte, saranagata-palakah The unprecedented, gracious reward of surrender - Being most affectionate toward His surrendered souls, the Supreme Lord totally dispels their unhappiness, graciously filling their hearts with His sweet absolute presence. 1.48 apy asiddham tadiyatvam, vine ca saranagatim ity apurva-phalatvam hi, tasyah samsanti panditah Without unconditional surrender (saranagati), one cannot conceive of oneself as ‘belonging to Him.’ And this is why the learned sing (par excellence) the glories of surrender’s ability to yield her unprecedented, gracious fruit. 1.49 athava bahubbir etair, uktibhih kim prayojanam sarva-siddhir bhaved eva, govinda-caranasrayat Otherwise, what would have been the need for so abundantly singing her praises? Only by unconditional surrender unto the lotus feet of Govinda is all perfection attained - nothing remains to be attained. 1.50 sri-sanatana-jivadi-, mahajana-samahrtam. api cen nica-samsprstam, piyusam piyatam budhah Even though touched by one as lowly as me, please, O learned devotees, drink this nectar gathered by the great souls headed by Srila Sanatana and Sri Jiva. iti sri-prapanna-jivanamrte upakramamrtam nama prathamo ‘dhyayah thus ends the first chapter Prelude to Approaching Nectar in Life-Nectar of the Surrendered Souls Positive and Progressive Immortality 2.1 Chapter 2 Sri Sastra-vacanamrtam The Nectar of Scriptural Word sruti-smrty-adi-sastresu, prapattir yan nirupyate tad uktam dvitiyadhyaye, sri-sastra-vacanamrte This second chapter, Sri Sastra-vacanamrtam, The Nectar of Scriptural Word, describes surrender as corroborated in the Revealed Scriptures headed by the Vedas (Sruti) and the Religious Codes (Smrti). 2.2 prapattih srutau - yo brahmanam vidadhati-purvam yo brahma-vidyam tasmai gah palayati sma krsnah tam hi devam atma-vrtti-prakasam mumuksur vai saranam amum vrajet Tapanyam (Brahma-Samhita, tika) Surrender is firmly established by the Vedas - “In the beginning of creation, He who created the universal creator, Brahma, and then imparted to Brahma knowledge of Brahman, the Absolute - He is the selfsame Lord Krsna who tends the cows (or nourishes the Vedas [gah means both ‘cows’ and Vedas]). Those desirous of liberation should surrender unto that Lord, who reveals the innate function of the soul.” 2.3-4 tadatmya-yatharthyam smrtau ahankrtir ma-karah syan, na-karas tan nisedhakah tasmat tu namasa ksetri-, svatantryam pratisidhyate bhagavat-paratantro ‘sau, tad ayattatma-jivanah tasmat sva-samarthya-vidhim, tyajet sarvam asesatah Padma-uttara-khanda The cause of the tangible reality of surrender is expounded in the Standard Codes of Religion (Smrti) - “The syllable ma means ‘self-asserting ego’ (the misconception of considering oneself to be a ‘doer’), and the syllable na indicates its prevention. Thus, the act of offering obeisances (namah) nullifies the offerer’s independence. The soul is naturally subordinate to the Almighty, his intrinsic nature and innate function being servitude to the Supreme Lord. Therefore, all actions performed thinking, ‘I am the doer,’ should be utterly abandoned.” 2.5 ahankarad-aprapattih - ahankara-nivrttanam, kesavo nahi duragah ahankara-yutanam hi, madhye parvata-rasayah Brahma-vaivartta Purana The only obstacle to surrender is self-asserting ego - “The Supreme Lord Kesava remains in the company of persons who are free from a mundane conception of life; but there appears to be a great mountain range between the self-asserting egotists and the Lord.” 2.6 advaya-jnanam anasritanam eva jagad-darsanam - yavat prthaktvam idam atmana indriyartha- maya-balam bhagavato jana isa pasyet tavan na samsrtir asau pratisankrameta vyarthapi duhkha-nivaham vahati kriyarthaBhagavatam, 3.9.9 Persons who do not take shelter of the One without a second, the Supreme Lord, simply loiter in the world of birth and death “O Lord, Soul of all souls, the conditioned soul sees this universe as separate from You, and thinks it is meant for his sense enjoyment. But this is only a creation of Your deluding potency (maya). As long as the living being clings to such an illusory separate interest, he does not give up the miserable world of action and reaction, birth and death, despite its utter meaninglessness.” 2.7 tan nityatvam, tad abhave atmano vancitatvat - prapyapi durllabhataram,.manusyam vibudhepsitam yair asrito na govindas, tair atma vancitas ciram Brahma-vaivartta Purana The unsurrendered soul is perpetually deceived; thus, the state of surrender is eternal - “A birth in the human species is so valuable that it is aspired for by the demigods. Those who, despite having taken such a birth, do not take shelter of the lotus feet of Govinda - they deceive themselves perpetually.” 2.8-9 aprapannanam jivana-vaiphalyac ca - asitin caturas caiva, laksams tan jiva-jatisu bhramyadbhih purusaih prapya, manusyam janma-paryayat tad apy aphalatam yatam, tesam atmabhimaninam varakanam anasritya, govinda-carana-dvayam Brahma-vaivartta Purana The utter futility of life without surrender - “After wandering throughout 8,400,000 species, the soul eventually takes a human birth. But that human birth is rendered worthless by those miserable fellows who are so proud of their bodies that they refuse to take shelter of the lotus feet of Lord Govinda.” 2.10 sarvadhamesv api mukti-datrtvam - sarvacara-vivarjitah satha-dhiyo vratya jagad-vancaka dambhahankrti-pana-paisuna-parah papantyaja nisthurah ye canye dhana-dara-putra-niratah sarvadhamas te ‘pi hi sri-govinda-padaravinda-sarana mukta bhavanti dvija Even the lowest of men are liberated by surrender - Nrsimha Purana “O twice-born, persons who are devoid of all virtuous practices, who are outcast, rogues, deceitful, audacious, egotistic, addicted to intoxicants, hotbeds of sin, malicious, cruel-natured, grossly infatuated with son, wife, wealth, etc. - even such extremely fallen persons are liberated by surrendering unto the lotus feet of Sri Govinda.” 2.11 tan nisthasya nadho-gatih - paramartham asesasya, jagatam adi karanam saranyam saranam yato, govindam navasidati Brhan-Naradiya Purana A surrendered soul never falls down - “Sri Govinda is the origin of all the universes, the Supreme Truth, and the shelter of all.

No trace of apprehension remains for those who take refuge in Him, since they qualify for positive immortality.” 2.15 sarvartha-sadhakatvam samsare ‘smin maha-ghore, moha-nidra-samakule ye harim saranam yanti, te krtartha na samsayah Brhan-Naradiya Purana A surrendered soul is successful in all endeavors - “In the dense darkness of this material world which is engulfed in ignorance and sleep, those who surrender unto the holy lotus feet of Lord Hari are successful in all their endeavors. Of this there is no doubt.” 2.16 ajitendriyanam api siva-datvam - kim durapadanam tesam, pumsam uddama-cetasam yair asritas tirtha-padas, carano vyasanatyayah Bhagavatam, 3.23.42 By surrender, even persons of uncontrolled senses attain all good fortune - “The lotus feet of Lord Hari vanquish material existence. By surrendering unto His lotus feet, nothing remains difficult to achieve, even for a person of agitated mind.” 2.17 samsara-klesa-haritvam - sarira manasa divya, vaiyase ye ca manusah bhautikas ca katham klesa, badheran hari-samsrayam Bhagavatam, 3.22.37 All worldly suffering is vanquished for the surrendered soul - “O Vidura, how can a person who has taken shelter of the lotus feet of Sri Hari be stricken with bodily and mental tribulation arising from the elements, other persons, or unfavorable astrological circumstances?” 2.18 saranagatanam ayatna-siddham eva param padam - samasrita ye pada-pallava-plavam mahat-padam punya-yaso murareh bhavambudhir vatsa-padam param padam padam padam yad vipadam na tesam Bhagavatam, 10.14.53 The Supreme Abode of Lord Visnu is effortlessly attainable for the surrendered souls - “This ocean of material existence is as insignificant as the water in a cow’s hoofprint to those persons who have taken full refuge in the supreme shelter - the boat of the lotus feet of Lord Sri Krsna, whose glories are universally sung as purity’s own self. Their destination is the Lord’s supreme abode, never this mundane abode of calamities.” 2.19 sarvatmasritanam vivarta nivrttih - yesam sa eva bhagavan dayayed anantah sarvatmanasrita-pado yadi nirvyalikam te dustaram atitaranti ca deva-mayam naisam mamaham iti dhih sva-srgala-bhaksye Bhagavatam, 2.7.42 The illusion of bodily identification and mundane possessiveness is dispelled for the souls surrendered to the Lord in all respects - “Due to their taking shelter of His lotus feet in all respects, those persons upon whom the Infinite Supreme Lord bestows His unreserved grace surpass the insurmountable illusory energy of the Lord. He does not favor those who ascribe the conceptions of ‘I and mine’ to this material body, which is food for jackals and hounds.” 2.20 tad upeksitanam duhkha-pratikarah ksanika eva - balasya neha saranam pitarau nrsimha nartasya cagadam udanvati majjato nauh taptasya tat-pratividhir ya ihanjasestas tavad vibho tanu-bhrtam tvad-upeksitanam Bhagavatam, 7.9.19 For persons devoid of a relationship with the Supreme Lord Hari, prevention of suffering cannot but be transitory - “O Nrsimha, O Almighty Lord, precautions and remedies are only short-lived when attempted by the suffering embodied souls who are not favored by You. Parents are not the guardians of their child, medicine is not the cure for the diseased, and a boat is not the savior of a man drowning in the ocean.” 2.21 anasritanam asad avagrahad eva vividharttih - tavad bhayam dravina-deha-suhrn-nimittam sokah sprha paribhavo vipulas ca lobhah tavan mamety asad-avagraha arti-mulam yavan na te ’nghrim abhayam pravrnita lokah Bhagavatam, 3.9.6 The various tribulations of the unsurrendered souls are simply due to their obsession with the unreal - “O Lord, as long as the people of the world do not take the safe and sound shelter of Your lotus feet, they remain full of anxiety about their wealth, their bodies, and their friends; overwhelmed with lamentation, hankering, obsession, and intense greed, they cannot obtain relief from the suffering which is deeply rooted in their imaginary conceptions of I and mine.” 2.22 paripurna-kamo harir evasrayaniyo ’nyad-heyam - avismitam tam paripurna-kamam, svenaiva labhena samam prasantam vinopasarpaty aparam hi balisah, sva-langulenatititartti sindhum Bhagavatam, 6.9.22 One should take refuge in the fully self-satisfied Supreme Lord Hari; the shelter of ‘other gods’ yields a lamentably inferior result - “Lord Krsna is perfectly replete in everything desirable, fully self-sufficient, poised and tranquil. Nothing can be astonishing for Him. Only a fool disregards Him to take shelter in any demigod whose propitiation may be prescribed for the accomplishment of worldly benefits. Such a person may be compared to one who seizes a dog’s tail in order to cross the ocean.” 2.23 harer eva sarvoddharitvam · kirata-hunandhra-pulinda-pulkasa abhira-sumbha yavanah khasadayah ye ’nye ca papa yad-upasrayasrayah sudhyanti tasmai prabhavisnave namah Bhagavatam, 2.4.18 Only Sri Hari is capable of delivering the living being in all circumstances - “Persons such as those belonging to the races known as Kirata, Huna, Andhra, Pulinda, Pulkasa, Abhira, Sumbha (Kanka), Yavana, and Khasa - nay, persons of each and every sinful birth are perfectly purified without a doubt, by taking shelter of the devotees surrendered to Lord Visnu, the Almighty.

O Universal Lord, those who do not accept the joy of the shelter of Your lotus feet and pursue the paths of abstract liberation and mundane acquisition - such persons are devastated by Your deluding potency.” 2.25 krsna-carana-saranagateh parama-sadhyatvam - na naka-prstham na ca sarva-bhaumam na paramesthyam na rasadhipatyam na yoga-siddhir apunar-bhavam va vanchanti yat pada-rajah prapannah Bhagavatam, 10.16.37 Full refuge in the lotus feet of Sri Krsna is the supreme objective - “Those souls who have taken refuge in the dust of Your lotus feet have no desire to attain heaven, universal dominion, the post of Lord Brahma, sovereignty over the earth, yogic perfections, or liberation.” 2.26 hari-prapannanam anya-nistara-samarthyam-atmaramanam api hari- pada-prapattis ca - yat pada-samsrayah suta, munayah prasamayanah sadyah punanty upasprstah, svardhuny-apo ’nusevaya Bhagavatam, 1.1.15 Souls surrendered unto the lotus feet of the Lord Hari are competent to deliver others, and the fully self-satisfied souls also surrender to the Lord’s lotus feet - “The slightest association with the supremely tranquil sages who have surrendered unto the lotus feet of the Lord purifies the people of the world; but the river Ganga purifies only those who bathe in it.” 2.27 sri-krsnaika-sarana naiva vidhi-kinkarah - devarsi-bhutapta-nrnam pitrnam na kinkaro nayam rni ca rajan sarvatmana yah saranam saranyam gato mukundam parihrtya karttam Bhagavatam, 11.5.41 Those souls who have exclusively surrendered unto Krsna are not subservient to scriptural injunctions and prohibitions - “O King, one who abandons all worldly obligations and wholeheartedly surrenders unto Mukunda, the exclusive shelter of all beings in every respect - such a person is no longer indebted to the demigods, sages, other life-forms, friends and relatives, mankind, and ancestors.” 2.28 tad anugrhita veda-dharmatita eva - yada yasyanugrhnati, bhagavan atma-bhavitah sa jahati matim loke, vede ca parinisthitam Bhagavatam, 4.29.45 The recipients of the Lord’s mercy are transcendental to Vedic religiosity - “Because of the intense love of His surrendered soul, the Supreme Lord bestows His grace upon that devotee by ushering divine inspiration into his heart. Such a devotee then abandons the preoccupation with adhering to worldly obligations and Vedic religiosity.” 2.29 sri-krsna-svarupam eva paramasraya-padam - dasame dasamam laksyam, asritasraya-vigraham sri-krsnakhyam param dhama, jagad-dhama namami tat Bhavartha-dipika, Bhagavatam, 10.1.1 As the epitome of divine ecstasy (rasa), the Supreme Lord’s original form - Krsna - is the highest refuge - “In the tenth canto of Srimad-Bhagavatam, Sri Krsna has been distinguished as the embodiment of shelter for the surrendered souls. I bow down unto that supreme refuge of the universe, who is known as, Krsna’.” 2.30 sriman-mahaprabhoh padasraya-mahatmyam - dhyeyam sada paribhava-ghnam abhista-doham tirthaspadam siva-virinci-nutam saranyam bhrtyarti-ham pranata-pala-bhavabdhi-potam vande maha-purusa te caranaravindam Bhagavatam, 11.5.33 The matchless, unsurpassable gift of surrender unto the lotus feet of Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, the Golden Avatara who enacts His pastimes as a great devotee - “O guardian of the surrendered, O great personality (the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself, who enacts His divine pastimes as a pure devotee [maha-bhagavata]), You alone are the reality to be constantly meditated upon by the pure souls. You are the destroyer of the soul’s illusion, You are the divine wish-fulfilling tree, the refuge of all devotees. Worshippable by Siva and Virinci (Sadasiva in the form of Sri Advaita Acarya, and Brahma in the form of Haridasa Thakura), You are the shelter of all and everything, and You are the dispeller of Your devotee’s suffering which originates in offenses to the holy name (nama-aparadha).

Life-Nectar of the Surrendered Souls Positive and Progressive Immortality
by the Intimate Servitor of
the Illustrious Universal Preceptor of Vaisnava Thought, Vaisnava-siddhantacarya-samrat Jagad-guru
Prabhupada Sri Srimad Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Goswami Maharaja:

Preface
(translated from the Publisher&rsquo;s Note of the first Bengali edition)
The best introduction to the author of this book is given by the work itself. Pujyapada Parivrajakacarya Tridandiswami Srimad Bhakti Raksaka Sridhara Maharaja is the fit recipient of the grace bestowed upon him by that great Universal Guru who shines like the sun among the Gaudiya Acaryas: Om Visnupada Sri Srimad Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Goswami Prabhupada. Srila Prabhupada, now left this world
to join the eternal divine pastimes, is the Divine Agent to flood the world with the nectarine universal preaching of the glory of the Supreme Lord, in the Divine Succession of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Although the devotional community is well-acquainted with the illustrious personality of His Holiness B.R. Sridhara Maharaja, I may nonetheless take the opportunity to enumerate some of his glories herein for my self- purification.
The brilliance of his unprecedented scholarship is found in the artful compilation and harmony of Sri Prapanna-jivanamrtam, Life Nectar of the Surrendered Souls, accurately drawn from the axiomatic teachings of pure devotion (bhakti-siddhanta-vani) as evolved by the Vaisnava preceptors in the line of the bona fide Scriptures. We have already seen the extraordinary competence of His Holiness in preaching the beautiful, illuminating conceptions of the kings of transcendental scholars - the Vaisnava Preceptors headed by Sri Rupa, Sri Sanatana, and Sri Jiva - in various languages throughout the whole of India. Upon reading the first Sanskrit poem composed by His Holiness, Sri Bhaktivinoda Viraha Dasakam, our Divine Master commented that the writing was of a happy style. Srila Prabhupada profusely praised the devotional gravity of the presentation, revealing his deep satisfaction and joyful confidence that in times to come the message of Sri Caitanyadeva would be befittingly upheld and preached by the author. Just prior to his entrance into his eternal pastimes, Srila Prabhupada, in preference to hearing devotional prayer (kirtana) performed by devotees recognized for expertise, called for His Holiness&rsquo; pure rendering of Sri Rupa-manjari pada, sei mora sampada, the worshipful prayer of the Gaudiya Vaisnavas&rsquo; most cherished ideal.
The theme of Life-Nectar of the Surrendered Souls is described in the introductory first chapter, Prelude to Approaching Nectar. In some instances throughout the work, the Bengali verse interpretation of the venerated pure devotees has been fittingly given for the translation of the authentic stanzas quoted. In Words of Nectar from the Devotees, statements of the Supreme Lord have occasionally been quoted in conformation with the development of the theme. In his explanatory aphorisms that precede each stanza, the author reveals the unique
axiomatic truths (siddhanta) of his Divine Succession. Doubtlessly, the good readers who know the supereminence of the Gaudiya- siddhanta - the axiomatic devotional teachings in the line of Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu - will be overjoyed with His Holiness&rsquo; novel illuminations. In the epilogue, the author has mentioned his line of Divine Succession and the time and place of the writing of the book.
It has been vividly illustrated herein that a life without surrender unto the lotus feet of Sri Krsna is utterly futile, and the most treasured perfection achieved through exclusive surrender has been revealed. This will especially encourage those who are aspiring to enter the land of devotion, drawing them onward to the lotus feet of Sri Hari. And it will infuse spiritual joy and exhilaration in the hearts of the established devotees. This book is the supreme wealth of the surrendered souls. Devotion for the Supreme Lord, Sri Hari-bhakti, is the singular quintessence in this world, and only by exclusive surrender, saranagati, is it happily attained. May this Life-Nectar of the Surrendered Souls graciously appear all the world over, distributing the ever-increasing aspiration to reach the abode of divine ecstasy - the lotus feet of Sri Hari. Just as the repeated rubbing of sandalwood produces more and more charming fragrance, we remain confident that the faithful devotees, whose only pleasure is in conclusive theological truth (sat-siddhanta), will experience the ambrosial devotional fragrance of this holy treatise in their spiritual discussions, and thus relish transcendental delight. We shall consider ourselves blessed when this book inevitably comes to be treasured by the august assembly of the fortunate souls.

Publisher&rsquo;s Note
Sri Sri Prapanna-jivanamrtam, The Life-nectar of the Surrendered Souls, is the crown-jewel of divine literatures as the eternal elixir of life for the exclusively surrendered souls, the bestower of the perpetual relish of full-fledged nectar, and the awakening and sustaining fountainhead of life in Divine Consorthood. Indeed, who can fittingly portray her holy glory and renown? In the same way we cannot but feel ever inadequate when we attempt to sing the glories of the illustrious author, our most worshipful Divine Master, Om Visnupada Sri Srila Bhakti Raksaka Sridhara Deva Goswami Maharaja, the dearmost intimate attendant of the great pioneer pre-eminent among the Gaudiya Acaryas, Sri Gauranga&rsquo;s transcendental message incarnate - Prabhupada Sri Srila Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Goswami Thakura. Even without world itineracy, the seat of Universal Guru (Jagad-guru) of the world&rsquo;s renowned gurus has been gracefully won by Srila Sridhara Deva Goswami Maharaja while presiding in the grand, noble distinction of his venerable years of devotional life at the Sri Chaitanya Saraswat Math of Nabadwip, his exclusive, personal holy place of bhajana.
Since its first printing, which was in Bengali, this sublime literature has brought heartfelt satisfaction to the stalwart devotees of the highest order, being hailed by them as an Essential Scripture to be unfailingly sung and cultivated as a daily devotional function in spiritual life, as is customarily practiced with the Holy Scriptures such as the Srimad Bhagavad-gita. In both the Eastern and Western countries, its English publication will doubtlessly be similarly worshiped with the utmost reverence, constantly studied and sung with devotion by the surrendered souls of fine theistic intellect, and by the noble souls engaged in their divine search for the Supreme Lord.
This monumental work was originally composed in the Sanskrit language. The authentic Bengali translation that was sanctioned by the author is extremely developed, profoundly exploring the heart of the book; scholars who know the internal conclusive scriptural purports can
alone realize how difficult is its translation and publication into English. However, by the boundless mercy of the most magnanimous Supreme Lord Sri Caitanyacandra, the fountainhead of all incarnations of Godhead, and by the causeless grace of His most beloved, our Divine Master, and the pure devotees whose hearts are absorbed in divine love - this formidable task has now been fulfilled. Thus, I again and again worship the holy lotus feet of Them all.
For their tireless efforts to usher in the Advent of the present edition in its perfectly elegant form, all those Godbrothers and Godsisters who served in the various facets of the publication have attained the unending graces of our Divine Master and the Vaisnavas. They have bound us in eternal gratitude. For executing the task of the English translation, proofing, and editing, special mention is due to Tridandiswami Sripada Bhakti Ananda Sagara Maharaja, assisted by Sriman Nimaisundara Brahmacari Vidyavinoda. And for their dedicated effort in securing the necessary funds and assistance for the printing and publishing of the work in a most dignified presentation, special mention is due to Sripada Dayadhara Gauranga Dasa Brahmacari Bhakti Prabhakara Prabhu and all the good devotees assisting him.
In conclusion, invoking the charming verse of Sri Gurupadapadma this humble servant earnestly prays at his holy lotus feet that this crownjewel of Sacred Writings, Sri Sri Prapanna-jivanamrtam, may remain with Her merciful presence in every land, in every home, and in every heart. And in Her gracious acquiescence, may She acknowledge the glorious victory of Her goodwill by churning and overflooding the entire living universe with Her supramundane wave of ecstatic love, to bless all souls with the supreme good fortune.

&ldquo;The bees, intoxicated in the festival of drinking the honey of the Lord&rsquo;s lotus feet, busily humming the glories of the Lord, drops of honey
from their mouths fall and scatter all around; for my divine prospect, I&rsquo;ve carefully collected some of those drops herein - and thus do I worship the dust of the holy lotus feet of those saints, again and again.&rdquo;
I beg to remain most humbly,
Tridandi-bhiksu Sri Bhakti Sundara Govinda

Foreword
Because the soul is a particle of consciousness, it is endowed with free will. Eliminating free will, only gross matter remains. Without independence, the soul could not progress from bondage to liberation, and his ultimate salvation would have been impossible. But his spirit of exploitation is a foreign force, an intoxicant - a miscalculation that surrounds his independence.
Life&rsquo;s objectives may be scientifically analyzed as threefold: exploitation, renunciation, and dedication. The most common tendency is in those engaged in exploiting other persons, species, or elements, for mundane sense enjoyment. They desire to materially elevate themselves in the present environment, and thus they are described as elevationists. A more sober class discover the severe equal and opposite reactions to worldly pursuits, and they engage in renunciation of the world, in search
of an equilibrium comparable to a deep, dreamless slumber. By being unawake to the world, they hope to escape its concomitant reactions and sufferings. Thus their goal is liberation, and they are known as salvationists or liberationists. But through the correct interpretation of the Revealed Scriptures by learned votaries such as Sri Sanatana Goswami, Sri Jiva Goswami, and Sri Ramanuja, the devotees of divinity know the pursuits of both exploitation and renunciation as not only fruitless, but injurious to real progress.
The normal, wholesome, and happy plane is in the life of dedication. Without exploiting or borrowing anything from the environment, and without attempting to artificially renounce it, one who is sincere to dedicate himself naturally comes into contact with a higher and more subtle plane of life. By his readiness to give and serve, he will attain to a higher society and achieve an appropriate master. The enjoying spirit forces one to be associated with a lower section to control and enjoy. And the renouncing spirit allures even the scholars with its &lsquo;prestigious&rsquo; superiority over exploitation. Thus it is more dangerous, just as a half-truth is more dangerous than falsehood. As it is difficult to awaken someone from the deepest possible sleep, the liberationists may remain for incalculable time within their cell of non-differentiated liberation. But the higher existence will invite the service of one who desires to purely dedicate himself without remuneration.
Seva - service, dedication, is the summum bonum of the teachings of the Vaisnava school, the third plane of life where every unit is a dedicating member in an organic whole. In such a normal adjustment, everyone mutually assists one another in their service to the center, the higher recipient, the highest entity. Everything is existing to satisfy Him, because He must possess this qualification to be the Absolute. He is the prime cause of all causes - and everything exists for Him, to satisfy Him.
A barren conception of mere &lsquo;deathlessness&rsquo; cannot afford us any knowledge of a positive thing, but only freedom from the negative side. If immortality means &rsquo;no influence of mortality,&rsquo; what, then, is its positive conception? What will be the nature, movement, and progress of that which is immortal? Without this understanding immortality is only an abstract idea. Because it does not appear to exhibit the symptoms of
death, stone would be &lsquo;more immortal&rsquo; than human beings, and conscious entities would be &lsquo;mortal,&rsquo; forever denied immortality! What, then, is the positive conception of immortality? How are the immortal &lsquo;immortal&rsquo;? What is the positive reality in immortality? How can one become immortal? One must search out his intrinsic location in the universal order. It will not do to attempt to solve only the negative side of life which is full of suffering - birth, death, infirmity, and disease. We should know that there exists a conception of life worth living for. This positive side has been almost totally neglected in general religious views.</h2>
<h2 id="persons-who-do-not-take-shelter-of-the-one-without-a-second-the-supreme-lord-simply-loiter-in-the-world-of-birth-and-death">The &lsquo;immortality&rsquo; professed by the schools of Buddha and Sankaracarya yields no positive life. Their goals are maha-nirvana and brahma-sayujya respectively. The Buddhist theory is that after liberation, nothing remains. They crave absolute extinction of material existence (prakrti-nirvana). And the Sankarite monist theory of liberation is to lose one&rsquo;s individuality by &lsquo;becoming one&rsquo; with the non-differentiated aspect of the Absolute. That is, they crave extinction in Brahman (brahma- nirvana). They postulate that when the triad of seer, seen, and seeing (drasta-drsya-darsana), or knower, knowable, and knowledge (jnata- jneya-jnana) culminate at one point, the triad is destroyed (triputi- vinasa) and nothing remains.
Material action and reaction ceases in Viraja, the river of passivity, which is located at the uppermost edge of this illusory (mayika) world. And above Viraja is the destination of the Sankarites - the &lsquo;abscissa&rsquo; stage or the non-differentiated plane of Brahman, called Brahmaloka, which is located at the lowest edge of the spiritual realm. Both are vague areas of ,negative immortality.&rsquo; Brahmaloka is a marginal or &lsquo;buffer&rsquo; state midway between the material and spiritual worlds. Composed of innumerable souls, it is an immortal plane devoid of specific variegatedness (nirvisesa). It possesses positivity only in the sense that it is a plane of existence, a background (kastha), but in itself it lacks positive development of variegated existence (kala). The nature of the background is oneness, and development woven over it necessitates plurality or a differentiated nature (kala-kasthadi rupena parinama- pradayini - Candi, Markandeya Purana).
In the Bhagavad-gita (15.16), mutable (ksara) and immutable
(aksara) existences are described, representing the personal and the impersonal, the development and the basis, or differentiated and non- differentiated conceptions of general existence. The mutable is represented by the multitude of embodied living beings, while the immutable aspect is the great expanse of the all-accommodating Absolute, the Brahman (8.3). In the analysis of worldly action, the most subtle form of unfructified past action, prior to the present tendency (the seedling stage) to sin, has been defined (Bhakti-rasamrita-sindhu, Purva 1.23) as unknowable, indistinct, and of untraceable origin (kuta). The immutable Brahman aspect of the Absolute is similarly defined as being one-dimensional - undetectable, unspecific, and of no definite color, sound, or taste; an unknown and unknowable &lsquo;un-understandable&rsquo; stage of existence (kuta). But the Supreme Lord, Krsna, is above both the mutable and immutable existences, and thus His glories are sung throughout the Vedas and in the world as the Purusottama, the Supreme Personality (Bhagavad-gita, 15.18). Sri Sukadeva Goswami affirms that in the most remote and distant plane, Lord Krsna is to be found: everywhere is He - the fountainhead of all conceptions (vidura-kasthaya, Bhagavatam, 2.4.14). He cannot be eliminated.
Thus, the &lsquo;immortality&rsquo; of the impersonalistic schools such as Buddhists, Sankarites, etc., offers no positive life. But in Vaisnavism, immortality is positive, dynamic existence. Above the non-differentiated Brahman aspect of the Absolute, the transcendental, variegated existence begins in the first glimpse of the spiritual sky, the plane known as Paravyoma (Chaitanya-charitamrita, Madhya 19.153). Situated there in the spiritual plane is the positive Kingdom of God: firstly Vaikuntha, then Ayodhya, Dvaraka, Mathura, and finally, above all, Goloka. Transcending the vague areas of &rsquo;negative immortality&rsquo; that the impersonalists aspire for, the devotees - the Vaisnavas - dedicate themselves to the life of eternal devotional service to the Supreme Lord of the transcendental realm (Bhagavad-gita, 18.54). Although the soul can maladopt himself to a fallen state of existence in the planes of exploitation and renunciation, he is inherently adoptable to the positive life in the Kingdom of God. And fully blossomed, he reaches the realm of Goloka (svarupe sabara haya golokete sthiti - Sri Sri Krsnera
Astottara-sata-nama).
Sri Prapanna-jivanamrtam: amrta means &lsquo;undying,&rsquo; or &rsquo;nectar,&rsquo; and jivana means &rsquo;life.&rsquo; Positive immortality is possible only for the surrendered (prapannanam). All others are necessarily mortal. Only those who have wholly given themselves to the center are living in eternality. Surrender is fully established in its excellence and its constant position. Yet there is variegatedness within that constancy, in the form of progressive movement, or pastimes (vilasa). The Supreme Absolute Personality being infinitely superior to both the mutable &ldquo;mortals&rsquo; and the immutable &ldquo;immortal&rsquo; (negative) Brahman, only the svarupa-siddha souls - those who are perfectly established in their divine relationship with Him - are eternally freed from the disease of mutation and mortality ( svarupena-vyavasthitih Bhagavatam, 2. 10.6).
With a broad vision, we must know ourselves as created of smaller stuff, and thus only with assistance from above can we improve our situation and achieve a position in the higher plane. A submissive, serving attitude is necessary in us. If we submit, the universal dictatorial aspect of the Absolute will take us upward to a higher prospect. He is the autocrat, the absolute knowledge, the absolute good - everything about Him is absolute. Being in a vulnerable position as we experience in this world, why, then, should we not submit to Him?
The road to the sphere of transcendence (adhoksaja) is the deductive or descending method (avaroha-pantha). We can reach the absolute good, the absolute will, by His consent alone. Only by faith in absolute surrender is anyone allowed entry into that domain, never by ,exploration,&rsquo; by,colonization,&rsquo; or by attempting to become a,monarch&rsquo; there. No inductive or ascending method (aroha-pantha) such as renunciation or yoga, etc., can compel Him to accept us. Whosoever He chooses can alone reach Him (Svetasvataropanisad, 6.23). Although the highest point of the renunciates is desirelessness or freedom from possessiveness, the surrendered soul (saranagata) is naturally desireless ( akincana, Chaitanya-charitamrita, Madhya 22.99). Detachment is only the negative side of surrender, and above selflessness, the devotee surrenders himself to the higher substance, and this is to be awake in another world, another plane of life. Such is the positive, Vaisnavaconception of life - to determine one&rsquo;s real self beyond the jurisdiction of the world of misconception.
The nature of the progressive substance is eternal existence, knowledge, and beauty (sac-cid-ananda). The one harmonizing organic whole (advaya-jnana-tattva) contains all similarities and differences, held inconceivably in the hand of the Absolute (acintya-bhedabheda- tattva). And there is no anarchy in the absolute power. Nonetheless, mercy is found to be above justice. Above judiciousness, the supreme position is held by love, sympathy, and beauty: &lsquo;I am the absolute power, but I am friendly to you all. Knowing this, you need never fear (Bhagavad-gita, 5.29).&rsquo; This revelation relieves us of all apprehension: we are not victims of a chaotic environment, but it is judicious, considerate - and the ultimate dispenser is our friend.
Sri Jiva Goswami has stated that of the six symptoms of surrender, to embrace the guardianship of the Lord (goptrtve varanam) is central, since total surrender expresses the same ideal. The remaining five symptoms of accepting the favorable, rejecting the unfavorable, faith in the Lord&rsquo;s protection, full self-surrender, and humility, are natural contributing associate-servitors to the ideal (angangi-bhedena sad-vidha; tatra &lsquo;goptrtve varanam&rsquo; evangi, saranagati-sabdenaikarthyat; anyani tv angani tat parikaratvat - Bhakti-sandarbha, 236).
Surrender is the foundation of the world of devotion. It is the very life and essence. One cannot enter into that domain without surrender. It must be present in every form of service, and to attempt divine service without it will be mere imitation or a lifeless formality. The entire gist of the Vedic instruction is to dedicate oneself to the service of the Lord. In his commentary of Srimad-Bhagavatam, Sri Sridhara Swamipada has stated that only if the practices of devotion are initially offered to the Supreme Lord can they be recognized as devotion. To attempt to execute them and subsequently offer them cannot be pure devotion (iti nava laksanani yasyah sa, adhitena ced bhagavati visnau bhaktih kriyate, sa carpitaiva sati yadi kriyeta, na tu krta sati pascad arpyeta) Without surrender, the activity will be adulterated with exploitation, renunciation, artificial meditation (karma, jnana,yoga), and so on.
By constitution, the soul is the Lord&rsquo;s servant, and the Lord has the
right to make or mar, to do anything according to His sweet will. If accepting this truth we undertake the devotional practices such as hearing, chanting, remembering, and worshipping, only then will our activity be devotional. Only the activity of the self-dedicated soul can be devotion. Sincere prayer will help us to seek the help of the Lord, but, again, prayer in the spirit of surrender can alone reach Him (Saranagati, 1.5). The path of devotion entails increasing our negative status to invite the positive to descend and embrace us: &lsquo;I am very low, and You are so high. You can purify me, take me and utilize me for Your higher purpose. Be pleased. Otherwise I am helpless, neglected.&rsquo; It is impossible to take Him captive in the cage of our knowledge. Only the way of devotion can help us. In every respect He is high, great, and infinite - and we are similarly small. His mercy - His sympathy, love, and grace, are the only medium through which we can come together. And good faith is autonomous in that sweet land which is so high that we will earnestly hope and pray for the association of the higher existence as His slave; and that also will be our happy prospect for the future.
Krsna is not within our purview, and thus we are always recommended by Scriptures and saints to approach the bona fide Divine Master and Vaisnavas. To satisfy the Supreme Lord, the criterion is to satisfy our Gurudeva: if Gurudeva is dissatisfied with us, the Lord is surely dissatisfied. An analogy has been cited in the Scriptures where the Lord is compared to the sun, the Guru to a pond, and the disciple to a lotus flower. If the pond withdraws, the very sun will scorch and dry up the lotus - and the lotus will be cheered by the sun as long as the water supports and surrounds it. Yasya prasadad bhagavat prasado, yasyaprasadan na gatih kuto &lsquo;pi, dhyayam stavams tasya yasas tri- sandhyam, vande guroh sri-caranaravindam (Gurvastakam, 8): &lsquo;I bow down to the lotus feet of Sri Gurudeva. By his grace we achieve the grace of Krsna; without his grace, we are lost. Therefore, at daybreak, noon, and evening, we meditate upon and sing the glories of Sri Gurudeva, and pray for his mercy.&rsquo;
The Vaisnava Guru&rsquo;s dealings with the disciple are all grace, and his grace is his will to extend his wealth to the disciple. His instruction is the medium of asserting his will, which is service for the satisfaction of the
Lord. And by service, we invite his grace. By an earnest desire to serve, we draw his sympathy and his willing extension of goodwill to encourage us in our relationship with the supreme entity. Firstly, surrender: we must offer him exclusive respect (pranipata), otherwise we shall not allow ourselves to approach him. Secondly, we may make our sincere and substantial inquiry (pariprasna). In a surrendered spirit, we may hear our Divine Master&rsquo;s messages which he delivers to us from his venerated seat, the Vyasasana. In that conducive setting, the proper inspiration and dictation may fortuitously come down to us. And finally, to render service (sevaya) enables us to taste the essence (Bhagavad-gita, 4.34).
On the instruction of his Gurudeva Devarsi Narada, Vyasadeva had to undergo a progressive development (Bhagavatam, 1.5). Narada is established in non-calculative devotion (jnana-sunya-bhakti, or jnana- vimukta-bhakti-paramah ), and above Narada is Uddhava, who is established in exclusive divine love for Krsna (premaika-nisthah). Until one reaches Goloka, where there is full-fledged Krsna conception, all other stages may be changeable. There is no further change when one is firmly established in his serving relationship with the Original Lord (svayam-bhagavan), Krsna. In the narrative of Brhad-Bhagavatamrtam, Gopakumara passes through Vaikuntha, Ayodhya, Mathura, Dvaraka, and then he finally arrives in Vrndavana. There, his particular divine relationship with the Lord firmly culminates in friendship (sakhya-rasa). For him, the previous stages were passing, although for others a permanent relationship may occur in one of them. They are progressive stages of,positive immortality.&rsquo;
On the banks of the Godavari river, in progressively deeper and deeper planes, the entirety of theological development was expressed in the conversation between Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu and Sri Ramananda Raya. A positive hierarchy of divine relationships with the Lord exists in progressive stages for the various types of devotees ( karmibhyah &hellip; kah krti, Upadesamritam, 10), each type having its characteristic central relationship (vaikunthaj &hellip; viveki na kah, Upadesamritam, 9). In the divine realm, the depth and degree of surrender may also be measured according to the science of mellows (rasa-tattva): peacefulness,
servitorship, friendship, parenthood, and consorthood (santa-, dasya-, sakhya-, vatsalya-and madhura-rasa) are the natural divisions, each consecutively of a finer layer. And higher than even the direct consorthood of the Godhead is the most elevated of the entire compass of devotional services - the divine service of the Supreme Predominated Moiety (Sri Radha-dasya).
According to the intensity of surrender - to the point of no return - the quality of the magnitude of truth encountered may be measured. The inner sweetness of the truth and its infinite characteristic attracts the devotees&rsquo; hearts to the highest degree, so much that they never feel any satisfaction of achievement in what is actually the acme of their highest fortune. In Vaikuntha, only peacefulness and servitorship are present, with a hint of friendship. If we commit the offense of giving more attention to law than to love, we will be &lsquo;cast down&rsquo; from Goloka to Vaikuntha: Goloka is the land of love, and there the inhabitants know nothing more. And by love is meant self-sacrifice and self-forgetfulness for the service of Krsna, without a care for one&rsquo;s good or bad future - total risk in the extreme.
In his Bhakti-sandarbha, Sri Jiva Goswami defines &lsquo;Bhagavan,&rsquo; the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as more than &lsquo;Lord Narayana of Vaikuntha, the most powerful in all phases.&rsquo; Above that, His existence, appearance, and nature attracts everyone to serve Him, love Him, and die for Him (bhajaniya-guna-visista). His qualification is so beautiful. Thus, the highest conception of the Godhead is the Krsna conception, and He can be known by the devotees in Krsna consciousness. Those who serve and worship the Supreme Lord according to the scriptural regulation and calculation belong to the category of Vaikuntha worship. In Vaikuntha, in the initial transcendental conscious conception (adhoksaja), the Godhead as Lord Narayana accepts reverential service in His Majestic Dignity. But the devotees of the highest order are exclusively surrendered to the
service of Lord Krsna with their innermost love and faith.
The Krsna conception of Goloka Vrndavana is corroborated in the Srimad Bhagavatam, which is the greatest interpretation of the Vedic Scriptures. And Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu is known to be Krsna Himself,
united with His highest potency, Sri Radha. Mahaprabhu Sri Caitanyadeva has clearly revealed that the genuine interpretation and purpose of all the Revealed Scriptures is to faithfully guide us to the highest goal: the domain of love and unconditional surrender unto the central power of truth, personified in Lord Krsna as beauty and affection. Not power, but affection is the highest force to attract us all. Consciously or unconsciously, the absolute position is held by love and affection, and love is superior to all power and knowledge. It is the real fulfillment of the inner heart. Our inner existence wants only love, beauty, and affection - neither knowledge nor power. The finite cannot capture the infinite, but the infinite can make Himself known to the finite. And when the infinite appears as a member of the finite land, the highest gain of the finite is achieved. Krsna carries His father&rsquo;s shoes, and He cries when chastised by His mother. Through love, the Absolute comes down to the finite.
The infinite&rsquo;s most intimate approach to the finite is found in Vrndavana. The infinite comes to embrace the finite in its fullest capacity (aprakrta), mixing with finite things so closely that people cannot perceive the Lord&rsquo;s transcendental Godly character as the Divinity. We, the infinitesimal souls, can attain our greatest fortune when the infinite comes to us in His highest approach - as if He were one of us! His approach is so merciful, so great, so intimate, and so perfect.
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, who is sweetness and magnanimity combined, openly announced that we are all natural slaves of the highest entity (Chaitanya-charitamrita, Madhya 20.108). But this is slavery to the great force of love and beauty. It is the greatest fortune to be utilized in any way by the absolute existence, knowledge, and beauty - to be in harmony with the highest center. No one is forced or barred but this is the soul&rsquo;s intrinsic nature.
Faithfully in the Divine Succession from Nitya-lila-pravista Om Visnupada Paramahamsa Astottara-sata Sri Srimad Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Goswami Prabhupada, especially inspired by the divine message of Srila Thakura Bhaktivinoda&rsquo;s Saranagati, and attending the authentic Gaudiya Vaisnava literatures such as Sri Hari-bhakti-vilasa and Bhakti-sandarbha as well as the writings of other Authorized Divine
Successions such as the Ramanuja Sampradaya - this Sri Sri Prapanna- jivanamrtam has been compiled in order to supply the devotees&rsquo; spiritual sustenance and nourishment. Surrender is the indispensable necessity in the life of a devotee, and Life-Nectar of the Surrendered Souls will sustain and fortify the surrendered souls as the nectar in their lives of Positive and Progressive Immortality.

I make my obeisance unto the Deity, Gaura-Saraswati - the personified message of the Golden Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu - whose bodily luster is of a beautiful golden hue, like that of the selfsame Lord Gaurasundara; who is the personal expansion of that Supreme Lord Gaurahari; who is always intoxicated by preaching the message of that Golden Lord; and whose divine beauty blooms in the revelation of Lord Gauranga&rsquo;s mercy potency. (This is the fundamental meaning of the verse. Within the scope of the Sanskrit
language, various expanded purports may be drawn from the original.)
1.3
guru-rupa-harim gauram, radha-ruci-rucavrtam nityam naumi navadvipe, nama-kirtana-nartanaih
Perpetually do I sing the glories of Lord Gauranga, who is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Sri Hari, embraced by the heart and halo of Sri Radhika, and who has descended as the Divine Master. In this holy abode of Sri Navadvipa Dhama, He is absorbed in the pastimes of profusely chanting the holy names, dancing in ecstasy. (As with verse two, expanded purports may be drawn from this verse.)

1.6
tad-vag-visargo janatagha-viplavo yasmin prati-slokam abaddhavaty api

&ldquo;Even if every stanza is imperfectly composed, that is, unlucidly expressed, the sins of the people are totally vanquished by those expressions or books in which the glorious holy names of the Infinite Supreme Lord are described - since the pure devotees hear those holy names (from a qualified preacher), they solitarily sing those holy names (even in the absence of others), and they chant the unending glories of those holy names (in the presence of a deserving listener).&rdquo;
1.7
abhivyakta mattah prakrti-laghu-rupad api budha vidhatri siddharthan hari-gunamayi vah krtir iyam pulindenapy agnih kim u samidham unmathya janito hiranya-sreninam apaharati nantah kalusatam
&ldquo;O learned personalities, this treatise, composed of the divine qualities of Lord Hari, will fulfill your cherished wishes despite the fact that it is presented by me, a very insignificant person. Does not the fire ignited from pieces of wood rubbed together by a low-born barbarian dissipate the impurities in gold?&rdquo;
1.8
yathokta rupa-padena, nicenotpadite &rsquo;nale
hemnah suddhis tathaivatra, viraharti-hrtih satam
As Srila Rupa Goswamipada has (in his humility) expressed that gold can be purified with fire lit by a barbarian, similarly, the pure devotees&rsquo; grief born of their separation from the Lord may also be dispelled by this book (which will light the lamp of their divine love for the Lord).
1.9
antah kovi-yasas-kamam, sadhutavaranam bahih sudhyantu sadhavah sarve, duscikitsyam imam janam
O saintly devotees, please purify this wrongdoer who on the pretext of saintliness desires in his heart the prestige of a poet, and who is thus afflicted with the practically incurable disease of insincerity.

krsna-gatha-priya bhakta, bhakta-gatha-priyo harih kathancid ubhayor atra, prasangas tat prasidatam
Tidings of Lord Krsna are naturally very dear to the devotees, and tidings of the Lord&rsquo;s devotees are also dear to Him. Since narratives of both the Supreme Lord and His devotees can be found within this book, I have hope, O pure devotees, that you may be propitiated hereby.
1.11
svabhava-krpaya santo, mad uddesya-malinatam

O pure devotees, by your natural divine grace, kindly purify me of ill motives (offenses) and accept this treatise. Certainly you will do so, because you are the ocean of causeless mercy.

Introduction to the book -
The substance expressed within the ten chapters of this holy book called Prapanna-jivanamrtam gives life to the surrendered souls, effecting their eternal growth and nourishment. It is the panacea of the heart and spiritual senses, bestowing those dedicated devotees&rsquo; mutual happiness by the ever-increasingly newer and newer play of supramundane joy (aprakrta-rasa). Lord Krsna and His associates are portrayed in their natural pastimes of separation and union, and the line of unconditional surrender as established by Scriptures and saints has been elucidated.
1.15-22

Carefully compiled in this book is the nectar of the deep,
heartrevealing transcendental messages of those devotees whose hearts are unalloyed; who are servitors of the dust of the lotus feet of Krsna; who perform their every act for Krsna; who are filled with insatiable desire exclusively in love of Krsna and sustain their lives on Krsna&rsquo;s remnants alone; who desire only Krsna&rsquo;s pleasure andserve the servants of Krsna; whose hearts burn in separation of Krsna and overflow with ecstasy in the association of Krsna; whose relative and friend is Krsna; and whose one and only beloved is Krsna.
Along with these expressions of the devotees are carefully collected the words of supreme nectar - springing directly from the lotus mouth of Lord Govinda - which vanquish the heartbreak of the devotees; which fulfill the devotee&rsquo;s hopes and earnest aspirations; which destroy all doubt and sever the knot of ignorance; which are dazzling with transcendental wisdom and astonish the heart by miraculous waves of divine rapture, which are the great panacea for the devotee&rsquo;s heart afflicted with the piercing pangs of separation; which are incited wholly for the devotee irrespective of his qualification or disqualification, so much so, that the Lord is bound by His pledge to give Himself to His devotee; and which openly proclaim with great ecstasy that His very nature is to be subjugated solely by the affection of His devotee, reassuring His devotees in all circumstances.
O pure and spotless devotees, may you drink deeply the quintessence of these divine elixirs.

Chapter summary -
An auspicious invocation, a humble petition, an introduction to the book and its chapters, and the theme of the philosophy of the book have, to the best of my ability, all been entered within this first chapter named Upakramamrtam or Prelude to Approaching Nectar.

prapattih sad-vidha prokta, bhagavata-ganodita
Chapters three to eight inclusive are entitled Sri Bhakta- vacanamrtam, Words of Nectar from the Devotees. Beautifully expressed by the lotus lips of the pure devotees of the Lord, many stanzas describing the six limbs of exclusive surrender are quoted therein.
1.26-27
anakulyasya sankalpah, pratikulya-vivarjanam raksisyatiti visvaso, goptrtve varanam tatha atma-niksepa karpanye, sad-vidha saranagatih evam paryayatas casminn, ekaikadhyaya-sangrahah
These six chapters have been compiled, each consecutively dealing with the six limbs of surrender, which are as follows: 1. To accept everything favorable for devotion to Krsna 2. To reject everything unfavorable for devotion to Krsna 3. To be confident that Krsna will grant His protection 4. To embrace Krsna&rsquo;s guardianship
5. To offer oneself unto Him
6. To consider oneself lowly and bereft
1.28
adhyaye navame nama, bhagavad-vacanamrte slokamrtam samahrtam, saksad-bhagavatoditam
In the ninth chapter entitled Sri Bhagavad-vacanamrtam, Words of Nectar from the Supreme Lord, nectarean stanzas emanating directly from the lotus mouth of the Supreme Lord have been compiled.
1.29
dasame caramadhyaye, cavasesamrtabhidhe
guru-krsna-smrtau grantha-, syopasamharanam krtam
Absorbed in thought of the Divine Master and Lord Sri Krsna, the tenth and final chapter entitled Sri Avasesamrtam, The Divine Remnants of Nectar, was composed as the epilogue of the book.
1.30
uddhrta-sloka-purve tu, tad artha-suprakasakam
vakyan ca yatnatas tatra, yatha-jnanam nivesitam
Prior to each stanza quoted, an aphorism illuminating its inner purport has been carefully entered according to my best insight.
1.31
bhagavad-gauracandranam, vadanendu-sudhatmika bhaktoktair vesita sloka, bhakta-bhavodita yatah
Being revealed by the Lord Himself adopting the heart of a devotee, the stanzas of pure nectar emanating from the moon of Sri Gauracandra have been entered along with the stanzas of the devotees.
1.32
prapattya saha cananya-, bhakter naikatya-hetutah ananya-bhakti-sambandham, bahu-vakyam ihoddhrtam
Many expressions of exclusive devotion (ananya-bhakti) have been recorded herein, since exclusive devotion is most intimately
related to surrender.
1.33
bhagavad-bhakta-sastranam, sambandho &lsquo;sti parasparam tat tat pradhanyato namnam, prabbeda-karanam smrtam
Actually, Words of Nectar from the Supreme Lord, Words of Nectar from the Devotees, and The Nectar of Scriptural Word are all seen to be interrelated. Still, they have been portrayed separately due to their individual importance.
1.34
praty-adhyaya-visesas tu, tatra tatraiva vaksyate mahajana-vicarasya, kincid alocyate &lsquo;dhuna
The unique characteristic of each chapter will be accordingly expressed therein. Now (in this respect), we may have some general deliberation, in the line of the great devotees of the Lord.
1.35
vastu-nirnayah -
bhagavad-bhaktitah sarvam, ity utsrjya vidher api kainkaryam krsna-padaika-, srayatvam saranagatih
Theme of the work -
Being governed by the faith that all success is achieved by serving the Supreme Lord, to abandon servitude to even scriptural injunctions and take exclusive refuge in the lotus feet of Sri Krsna in every time, place, and circumstance, is known as saranagati - unconditional surrender.
1.36
sarvantaryamitam drstva, hareh sambandhato &lsquo;khile
aprthag-bhava-tad-drstih, prapattir jnana-bhaktitah
Some consider saranagati to be that God consciousness which is realization of the one non-differentiated nature in all beings and objects, by seeing the Supreme Lord as the indwelling Supersoul of everything. However, such a conception falls within the category of calculative devotion (jnana-bhakti). It is not in the line of unadulterated pure devotion (suddha-bhakti).
1.37
nityatvan caiva sastresu, prapatter jnayate budhaih aprapannasya nr-janma-, vaiphalyoktes tu nityata
By scriptural reference, the learned know of the eternality of surrender to the Lord, since the futility of human life without that surrender is elucidated therein. In this way, the eternal constitution of surrender is established.
1.38
nanyad icchanti tat pada-, rajah-prapanna-vaisnavah
kincid apiti tat tasyah, sadhyatvam ucyate budhaih
Because the devotees who have surrendered unto the dust of the lotus feet of the Lord never aspire for anything else whatsoever, the learned affirm that surrender is the attainable goal of all endeavors.
1.39
bhava-duhkha-vinasas ca, para-nistara-yogyata
param padam prapattyaiva, krsna-sampraptir eva ca
Only by surrender to the Lord can one gain freedom from the miseries of birth, death, disease, and infirmity; fitness to deliver others from those miseries; the holy abode of Lord Visnu; and the devotional service of Lord Krsna.
1.40
sravana-kirtanadinam, bhakty-anganam hi yajane
aksamasyapi sarvaptih, prapattyaiva harav iti
Everything is accomplished by surrendering unto the lotus feet of Sri Hari, even for one who is unable to execute the integral practices of devotional service based on hearing and chanting.
1.41
sakhya-rasasrita-praya, seti kecit vadanti tu
madhuryadau prapannanam, praveso nasti ceti na
Some claim that surrender is generally in the relationship of friendship (sakhya-rasa). But it is complete fallacy to think that surrendered souls have no entrance into divine relationships headed by consorthood (madhura-rasa).
1.42
sakrt pravrtti-matrena, prapattih sidhyatiti yat lobhotpadana-hetos tad, alocana-prayojanam
Since surrender is achieved by turning to the refuge of the Lord just once, we should earnestly discuss the subject to enable the longing for surrender to be born in us.
1.43
api tad anakulyadi-, sankalpady-anga-laksanat tad anusilaniyatvam, ucyate hi mahajanaih
Furthermore, since the constituent parts of surrender - based on acceptance of the favorable and rejection of the unfavorable - have been referred to by authorities and cited in the Scriptures, the great devotees of the Lord teach us the necessity of studying and culturing the art of surrender.
1.44
bhavarti-pidyamano va, bhakti-matrabhilasy api
vaimukhya-badhyamano &rsquo;nya-, gatis tac charanam vrajet
One who is severely afflicted by fear of living in the material world, or, one who, despite having an aspiration for the Lord&rsquo;s service is nonetheless bound with adversity - such persons, finding no alternative, surrender to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
1.45
asrayantara-rahitye, vanyasraya-visarjane ananya-gati-bhedas tu, dvi-vidhah parikirtitah
The state of finding no other alternative occurs in two ways: in the event of having no other shelter, or in the event of abandoning one&rsquo;s existing shelter.
1.46
mano-vak-kaya-bhedac ca, tri-vidha saranagatih
tasam sarvanga-sampanna, sighram purna-phala-prada nyunadhikyena caitasam, taratamyam phale &lsquo;pi ca
One surrenders by thought, word, and deed. Complete surrender in all these aspects promptly affords full success. Otherwise, the fruit attained will be proportionate to the degree of one&rsquo;s surrender.
1.47
apurva-phalatvam -
vinasya sarva-duhkhani, nija-madhurya-varsanam karoti bhagavan bhakte, saranagata-palakah
The unprecedented, gracious reward of surrender -
Being most affectionate toward His surrendered souls, the Supreme Lord totally dispels their unhappiness, graciously filling their hearts with His sweet absolute presence.
1.48
apy asiddham tadiyatvam, vine ca saranagatim
ity apurva-phalatvam hi, tasyah samsanti panditah
Without unconditional surrender (saranagati), one cannot conceive of oneself as &lsquo;belonging to Him.&rsquo; And this is why the learned sing (par excellence) the glories of surrender&rsquo;s ability to yield her unprecedented, gracious fruit.
1.49
athava bahubbir etair, uktibhih kim prayojanam sarva-siddhir bhaved eva, govinda-caranasrayat
Otherwise, what would have been the need for so abundantly singing her praises? Only by unconditional surrender unto the lotus feet of Govinda is all perfection attained - nothing remains to be attained.

Chapter 2
Sri Sastra-vacanamrtam The Nectar of Scriptural Word
sruti-smrty-adi-sastresu, prapattir yan nirupyate
tad uktam dvitiyadhyaye, sri-sastra-vacanamrte
This second chapter, Sri Sastra-vacanamrtam, The Nectar of Scriptural Word, describes surrender as corroborated in the Revealed Scriptures headed by the Vedas (Sruti) and the Religious Codes (Smrti).
2.2
prapattih srutau -
yo brahmanam vidadhati-purvam yo brahma-vidyam tasmai gah palayati sma krsnah tam hi devam atma-vrtti-prakasam mumuksur vai saranam amum vrajet
Tapanyam (Brahma-Samhita, tika)
Surrender is firmly established by the Vedas -
&ldquo;In the beginning of creation, He who created the universal creator, Brahma, and then imparted to Brahma knowledge of Brahman, the Absolute - He is the selfsame Lord Krsna who tends the cows (or nourishes the Vedas [gah means both &lsquo;cows&rsquo; and Vedas]). Those desirous of liberation should surrender unto that Lord, who reveals the innate function of the soul.&rdquo;
2.3-4
tadatmya-yatharthyam smrtau
ahankrtir ma-karah syan, na-karas tan nisedhakah tasmat tu namasa ksetri-, svatantryam pratisidhyate bhagavat-paratantro &lsquo;sau, tad ayattatma-jivanah tasmat sva-samarthya-vidhim, tyajet sarvam asesatah
Padma-uttara-khanda
The cause of the tangible reality of surrender is expounded in the Standard Codes of Religion (Smrti) -
&ldquo;The syllable ma means &lsquo;self-asserting ego&rsquo; (the misconception of considering oneself to be a &lsquo;doer&rsquo;), and the syllable na indicates its prevention. Thus, the act of offering obeisances (namah) nullifies the offerer&rsquo;s independence. The soul is naturally subordinate to the Almighty, his intrinsic nature and innate function being servitude to the Supreme Lord. Therefore, all actions performed thinking, &lsquo;I am the doer,&rsquo; should be utterly abandoned.&rdquo;
2.5
ahankarad-aprapattih -
ahankara-nivrttanam, kesavo nahi duragah ahankara-yutanam hi, madhye parvata-rasayah
Brahma-vaivartta Purana
The only obstacle to surrender is self-asserting ego -
&ldquo;The Supreme Lord Kesava remains in the company of persons who are free from a mundane conception of life; but there appears to be a great mountain range between the self-asserting egotists and the Lord.&rdquo;
2.6
advaya-jnanam anasritanam eva jagad-darsanam - yavat prthaktvam idam atmana indriyartha-
maya-balam bhagavato jana isa pasyet tavan na samsrtir asau pratisankrameta
vyarthapi duhkha-nivaham vahati kriyarthaBhagavatam, 3.9.9
Persons who do not take shelter of the One without a second, the Supreme Lord, simply loiter in the world of birth and death</h2>
<h2 id="harer-eva-sarvoddharitvam-">&ldquo;O Lord, Soul of all souls, the conditioned soul sees this universe as separate from You, and thinks it is meant for his sense enjoyment. But this is only a creation of Your deluding potency (maya). As long as the living being clings to such an illusory separate interest, he does not give up the miserable world of action and reaction, birth and death, despite its utter meaninglessness.&rdquo;
2.7
tan nityatvam, tad abhave atmano vancitatvat - prapyapi durllabhataram,.manusyam vibudhepsitam yair asrito na govindas, tair atma vancitas ciram
Brahma-vaivartta Purana
The unsurrendered soul is perpetually deceived; thus, the state of surrender is eternal -
&ldquo;A birth in the human species is so valuable that it is aspired for by the demigods. Those who, despite having taken such a birth, do not take shelter of the lotus feet of Govinda - they deceive themselves perpetually.&rdquo;
2.8-9
aprapannanam jivana-vaiphalyac ca -
asitin caturas caiva, laksams tan jiva-jatisu
bhramyadbhih purusaih prapya, manusyam janma-paryayat tad apy aphalatam yatam, tesam atmabhimaninam
varakanam anasritya, govinda-carana-dvayam
Brahma-vaivartta Purana
The utter futility of life without surrender -
&ldquo;After wandering throughout 8,400,000 species, the soul
eventually takes a human birth. But that human birth is rendered worthless by those miserable fellows who are so proud of their bodies that they refuse to take shelter of the lotus feet of Lord Govinda.&rdquo;
2.10

Even the lowest of men are liberated by surrender -
Nrsimha Purana
&ldquo;O twice-born, persons who are devoid of all virtuous practices, who are outcast, rogues, deceitful, audacious, egotistic, addicted to intoxicants, hotbeds of sin, malicious, cruel-natured, grossly infatuated with son, wife, wealth, etc. - even such extremely fallen persons are liberated by surrendering unto the lotus feet of Sri Govinda.&rdquo;
2.11
tan nisthasya nadho-gatih -
paramartham asesasya, jagatam adi karanam saranyam saranam yato, govindam navasidati
Brhan-Naradiya Purana
A surrendered soul never falls down -
&ldquo;Sri Govinda is the origin of all the universes, the Supreme Truth, and the shelter of all. One who surrenders unto His lotus feet can never be cast asunder.&rdquo;
2.12-13
duhkha-haratvam mano-haratvan ca -

rajams tava yadu-srestho, vaikunthah purusottamah ya enam samsrayantiha, bhaktya narayanam harim te tarantiha durgani, na me &rsquo;trasti vicarana
Mahabharata, Santi-parva
Surrender unto the Supreme Lord Hari vanquishes misery and charms the heart with the Lord&rsquo;s divine sweetness -
O King, what more can I say? The foremost of the Yadu dynasty, the unassailable great personality who is full of goodwill for you and always your dear friend - He is none other than the Supreme Lord Narayana, Sri Hari. Those who devotedly take full refuge in Him cross over this insurmountable ocean of material existence.&rdquo;
2.14
abhayamrta-datrtvan ca -
ye sankha-cakrabja-karam hi sarnginam khagendra-ketum varadam sriyah patim samasrayante bhava-bhiti-nasanam tesam bhayam nasti vimukti-bhajam
Completely vanquishing all fear, surrender bestows the life of eternal nectar -
Vamana
&ldquo;The Lord of the Goddess of Fortune bears a conchshell, disc, lotus flower, and bow; He is the Master of Garuda, He is the vanquisher of the fear of mundane existence, He is the bestower of all benedictions. No trace of apprehension remains for those who take refuge in Him, since they qualify for positive immortality.&rdquo;
2.15
sarvartha-sadhakatvam
samsare &lsquo;smin maha-ghore, moha-nidra-samakule
ye harim saranam yanti, te krtartha na samsayah
Brhan-Naradiya Purana
A surrendered soul is successful in all endeavors -
&ldquo;In the dense darkness of this material world which is engulfed in ignorance and sleep, those who surrender unto the holy lotus feet of Lord Hari are successful in all their endeavors. Of this there is no doubt.&rdquo;
2.16
ajitendriyanam api siva-datvam -
kim durapadanam tesam, pumsam uddama-cetasam yair asritas tirtha-padas, carano vyasanatyayah
Bhagavatam, 3.23.42
By surrender, even persons of uncontrolled senses attain all good fortune -
&ldquo;The lotus feet of Lord Hari vanquish material existence. By surrendering unto His lotus feet, nothing remains difficult to achieve, even for a person of agitated mind.&rdquo;
2.17
samsara-klesa-haritvam -
sarira manasa divya, vaiyase ye ca manusah
bhautikas ca katham klesa, badheran hari-samsrayam
Bhagavatam, 3.22.37
All worldly suffering is vanquished for the surrendered soul -
&ldquo;O Vidura, how can a person who has taken shelter of the lotus feet of Sri Hari be stricken with bodily and mental tribulation arising from the elements, other persons, or unfavorable astrological circumstances?&rdquo;
2.18
saranagatanam ayatna-siddham eva param padam - samasrita ye pada-pallava-plavam
mahat-padam punya-yaso murareh bhavambudhir vatsa-padam param padam
padam padam yad vipadam na tesam
Bhagavatam, 10.14.53
The Supreme Abode of Lord Visnu is effortlessly attainable for the surrendered souls -
&ldquo;This ocean of material existence is as insignificant as the water in a cow&rsquo;s hoofprint to those persons who have taken full refuge in the supreme shelter - the boat of the lotus feet of Lord Sri Krsna, whose glories are universally sung as purity&rsquo;s own self. Their destination is the Lord&rsquo;s supreme abode, never this mundane abode of calamities.&rdquo;
2.19
sarvatmasritanam vivarta nivrttih -
yesam sa eva bhagavan dayayed anantah sarvatmanasrita-pado yadi nirvyalikam te dustaram atitaranti ca deva-mayam naisam mamaham iti dhih sva-srgala-bhaksye
Bhagavatam, 2.7.42
The illusion of bodily identification and mundane possessiveness is dispelled for the souls surrendered to the Lord in all respects -
&ldquo;Due to their taking shelter of His lotus feet in all respects, those persons upon whom the Infinite Supreme Lord bestows His unreserved grace surpass the insurmountable illusory energy of the Lord. He does not favor those who ascribe the conceptions of &lsquo;I and mine&rsquo; to this material body, which is food for jackals and hounds.&rdquo;
2.20

tavad vibho tanu-bhrtam tvad-upeksitanam
Bhagavatam, 7.9.19
For persons devoid of a relationship with the Supreme Lord Hari, prevention of suffering cannot but be transitory -
&ldquo;O Nrsimha, O Almighty Lord, precautions and remedies are only short-lived when attempted by the suffering embodied souls who are not favored by You. Parents are not the guardians of their child, medicine is not the cure for the diseased, and a boat is not the savior of a man drowning in the ocean.&rdquo;
2.21
anasritanam asad avagrahad eva vividharttih - tavad bhayam dravina-deha-suhrn-nimittam sokah sprha paribhavo vipulas ca lobhah tavan mamety asad-avagraha arti-mulam yavan na te &rsquo;nghrim abhayam pravrnita lokah
Bhagavatam, 3.9.6
The various tribulations of the unsurrendered souls are simply due to their obsession with the unreal -
&ldquo;O Lord, as long as the people of the world do not take the safe and sound shelter of Your lotus feet, they remain full of anxiety about their wealth, their bodies, and their friends; overwhelmed with lamentation, hankering, obsession, and intense greed, they cannot obtain relief from the suffering which is deeply rooted in their imaginary conceptions of I and mine.&rdquo;
2.22
paripurna-kamo harir evasrayaniyo &rsquo;nyad-heyam - avismitam tam paripurna-kamam, svenaiva labhena samam
prasantam
vinopasarpaty aparam hi balisah, sva-langulenatititartti sindhum
Bhagavatam, 6.9.22
One should take refuge in the fully self-satisfied Supreme Lord Hari; the shelter of &lsquo;other gods&rsquo; yields a lamentably inferior result -
&ldquo;Lord Krsna is perfectly replete in everything desirable, fully self-sufficient, poised and tranquil. Nothing can be astonishing for Him. Only a fool disregards Him to take shelter in any demigod whose propitiation may be prescribed for the accomplishment of worldly benefits. Such a person may be compared to one who seizes a dog&rsquo;s tail in order to cross the ocean.&rdquo;

Bhagavatam, 2.4.18
Only Sri Hari is capable of delivering the living being in all circumstances -
&ldquo;Persons such as those belonging to the races known as Kirata, Huna, Andhra, Pulinda, Pulkasa, Abhira, Sumbha (Kanka), Yavana, and Khasa - nay, persons of each and every sinful birth are perfectly purified without a doubt, by taking shelter of the devotees surrendered to Lord Visnu, the Almighty. I do offer my respectful obeisances unto Him.&rdquo;
2.24

Bhagavatam, 11.29.3
Only surrendered souls can properly distinguish substance from form; those who disregard Lord Hari to seek happiness on the empirical paths based on yoga and karma are simply on a suicidal
course -
&ldquo;O lotus-eyed one, the swans (topmost pure devotees, paramahamsas) take refuge in Your ecstasy-yielding lotus feet. O Universal Lord, those who do not accept the joy of the shelter of Your lotus feet and pursue the paths of abstract liberation and mundane acquisition - such persons are devastated by Your deluding potency.&rdquo;
2.25

na naka-prstham na ca sarva-bhaumam na paramesthyam na rasadhipatyam na yoga-siddhir apunar-bhavam va vanchanti yat pada-rajah prapannah
Bhagavatam, 10.16.37
Full refuge in the lotus feet of Sri Krsna is the supreme objective - &ldquo;Those souls who have taken refuge in the dust of Your lotus feet have no desire to attain heaven, universal dominion, the post of Lord Brahma, sovereignty over the earth, yogic perfections, or liberation.&rdquo;
2.26
hari-prapannanam anya-nistara-samarthyam-atmaramanam api hari- pada-prapattis ca -
yat pada-samsrayah suta, munayah prasamayanah sadyah punanty upasprstah, svardhuny-apo &rsquo;nusevaya
Bhagavatam, 1.1.15
Souls surrendered unto the lotus feet of the Lord Hari are competent to deliver others, and the fully self-satisfied souls also surrender to the Lord&rsquo;s lotus feet -
&ldquo;The slightest association with the supremely tranquil sages who have surrendered unto the lotus feet of the Lord purifies the people of the world; but the river Ganga purifies only those who bathe in it.&rdquo;
2.27

devarsi-bhutapta-nrnam pitrnam

Bhagavatam, 11.5.41
Those souls who have exclusively surrendered unto Krsna are not subservient to scriptural injunctions and prohibitions -
&ldquo;O King, one who abandons all worldly obligations and wholeheartedly surrenders unto Mukunda, the exclusive shelter of all beings in every respect - such a person is no longer indebted to the demigods, sages, other life-forms, friends and relatives, mankind, and ancestors.&rdquo;
2.28
tad anugrhita veda-dharmatita eva -
yada yasyanugrhnati, bhagavan atma-bhavitah sa jahati matim loke, vede ca parinisthitam
Bhagavatam, 4.29.45
The recipients of the Lord&rsquo;s mercy are transcendental to Vedic religiosity -
&ldquo;Because of the intense love of His surrendered soul, the Supreme Lord bestows His grace upon that devotee by ushering divine inspiration into his heart. Such a devotee then abandons the preoccupation with adhering to worldly obligations and Vedic religiosity.&rdquo;
2.29

Bhavartha-dipika, Bhagavatam, 10.1.1
As the epitome of divine ecstasy (rasa), the Supreme Lord&rsquo;s original form - Krsna - is the highest refuge -
&ldquo;In the tenth canto of Srimad-Bhagavatam, Sri Krsna has been distinguished as the embodiment of shelter for the surrendered souls. I bow down unto that supreme refuge of the universe, who is known as, Krsna&rsquo;.&rdquo;
2.30

Bhagavatam, 11.5.33
The matchless, unsurpassable gift of surrender unto the lotus feet of Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, the Golden Avatara who enacts His pastimes as a great devotee -
&ldquo;O guardian of the surrendered, O great personality (the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself, who enacts His divine pastimes as a pure devotee [maha-bhagavata]), You alone are the reality to be constantly meditated upon by the pure souls. You are the destroyer of the soul&rsquo;s illusion, You are the divine wish-fulfilling tree, the refuge of all devotees. Worshippable by Siva and Virinci (Sadasiva in the form of Sri Advaita Acarya, and Brahma in the form of Haridasa Thakura), You are the shelter of all and everything, and You are the dispeller of Your devotee&rsquo;s suffering which originates in offenses to the holy name (nama-aparadha). You are the only boat for crossing the ocean of this material world ofsuffering. I do worship Your holy lotus feet.&rdquo;

Caitanya-candramrta 8.93
The souls surrendered unto the lotus feet of Sri Caitanyadeva bathe in the ocean of divine love -
&ldquo;If you have a desire to cross the ocean of material existence, an aspiration to taste the ecstasy of the nectarean congregational chanting of the holy names (sankirtana), and a longing to sport in the ocean of divine love - then please surrender unto the lotus feet of Sri Caitanyacandra.&rdquo;

Six divisions of surrender -
&ldquo;Acceptance of the favorable, rejection of the unfavorable, the faith that &lsquo;He will surely protect me,&rsquo; embracing the Lord&rsquo;s guardianship, complete dependence on Him, and the perception of one&rsquo;s utter helplessness without Him - these six are the essential limbs of exclusive surrender to the Lord (saranagati).&rdquo;
2.33

Vaisnava-tantra
Saranagati should be practiced in thought, word, and deed -
&ldquo;By his power of speech, the surrendered soul declares, &lsquo;I am Yours&rsquo;; in his thoughts, he knows the same; and in person, he takes refuge in the Lord&rsquo;s holy abode. In this way the surrendered soul passes his life, his heart filled with joy.&rdquo;

Everything should be done that encourages the service of Sri Krsna and His devotee, and whatever is conducive to the state of exclusive surrender must be executed: such a firm conviction is called anukulyasya-sankalpah - Acceptance of the Favorable.

Of everything favorable, Hari-sankirtana performed by souls surrendered unto the lotus feet of Lord Hari is paramount -
&ldquo;May the Sri Krsna Sankirtana be all-victorious in its pristine glory! This congregational chanting of the holy names of the Lord cleanses the looking-glass of consciousness, extinguishes the raging forest fire of material existence, and spreads the benediction moonrays that cause the lotus of the heart to bloom. This chanting is the life and soul of divine consorthood. Expanding the ocean of pure ecstasy, it is the flavor of full nectar at every moment, bathing and cooling the entire self.&rdquo;</h2>

(Bengali verse by Sri Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Thakura)
&ldquo;Knowing Krsna and His name to be identical truth, one embraces exclusively the holy name&rsquo;s path;
and thus who is initiated into chanting the name properly should be mentally respected as a member of the family.
And he who serves Krsna by constant worship of the name, within his heart e&rsquo;er residing at Sri Vrndavana Dhama -
know him an intermediate devotee, make obeisance at his feet
and keep him as a faithful friend in your thought and deed.
And who, by internal service to the name, knows his divine identity,
sees Krsna, only Krsna in every form and entity;
seeing nothing separate from Krsna in the entire creation, he sees all souls equally serving Krsna&rsquo;s predilection -
know such a veteran votary most honored and most cherished, serve him in thought, word, and deed, with heart&rsquo;s fulfillment relished:
with obeisance, inquiry, service, him in all respects entreat -
by the grace of such a great soul we can reach Lord Krsna&rsquo;s feet.&rdquo;

(Bengali verse by Sri Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Thakura)
&ldquo;Within, without, he who serves with (1) enthusiasm will gradually attain to the rarest pure devotion.
In devotion to Lord Krsna, one who has (2) firm faith
is a person loyal and devoted on the path.
And if Sri Krsna&rsquo;s service he fails to attain,
yet practices with (3) patience - devout is such a man.
(4) That which serves Lord Krsna, for only Krsna&rsquo;s pleasure, in such action, the devotee can never feel anger. (5) Abandoning the company of the non-devotee, ever with devotees, the devout serve Sri Hari.
(6) Following the pure devotees&rsquo; direction on the path, the true devout practice, as a matter of life and death. Who follow these six qualities qualify for pure devotion - they purify the universe by their preaching mission.&rdquo;

Within renunciation in devotion (yukta-vairagya), the foremost principle is to see everything in relationship to Lord Krsna (Krsna- sambandha-jnana) -
&ldquo;Adorned with the articles that have been offered to You, such as garlands, fragrant clothing, and ornaments, we, Your personal servitors who partake of Your holy remnants alone, will certainly be able to conquer Your illusory energy (maya).&rdquo;

The fundamental objective is to maintain constant remembrance of Sri Hari in every time, place and circumstance -
&ldquo;If persons engaged in the devotional service of Lord Hari are unable to obtain food and shelter despite their attempts, or if their acquisitions are lost or destroyed, they should, without anxiety, absorb their hearts deeply in the thought of Lord Hari.&rdquo;

This is accomplished only when one can see the grace of the Supreme Lord in every situation -
&ldquo;One who, in the hope of achieving Your grace, goes on enduring the inauspicious fruit of his own karma, and passes his days practicing devotion unto You in every thought, word, and deed - such a person is heir to the land of freedom: he attains to the plane of positive immortality.&rdquo;

Sri Saunakadinam
Only by the association of pure devotees (sadhu-sanga) is everything happily achieved -
&ldquo;The attainment of heaven or liberation cannot even slightly compare with the immeasurable fortune gained by the association of an associate of the Supreme Lord. What, then, can be said of the petty dominion and assets of mortal men?&rdquo;

Sri Prabuddhasya
Of all sadhu-sanga, the foremost is the service of the lotus feet of the bona fide Spiritual Master or Sad-guru -
&ldquo;Thus, a person in search of the ultimate good should surrender to the Guru who knows well the Vedic scriptures (Sabda-brahman)
and the Supreme Absolute Lord (Para-brahman), and for whom the mundane world holds no charm whatsoever.&rdquo;

Sri Prabuddhasya
At the lotus feet of that Sad-guru, divine relationship, practice, and objective (sambandha, abhidheya, and prayojana) are all achieved -
&ldquo;Those divine practices of pure devotional service that please the Self-giving Sri Hari (who gives Himself to His devotees) will be learned by continuously serving such a Guru with full sincerity, knowing him to be one&rsquo;s dearmost well-wishing friend and the supremely worshipful embodiment of Sri Hari.&rdquo;

Sri Kulasekharasya
Devotional service rendered to the devotee bestows the highest fruit -
&ldquo;O Supreme Lord of all beings, O slayer of the demons Madhu and Kaitabha, this is the purpose of my life, this is my prayer, and this is Your grace - that You will remember me as Your servant, a servant of a servant of a Vaisnava, a servant of a servant of such a servant of a servant of a Vaisnava, and a servant of a servant of the servant of a servant of a Vaisnava&rsquo;s servant&rsquo;s servant.&rdquo;</p>

Service to the Lord&rsquo;s devotee is not a trifling matter -
&ldquo;Some people take shelter in the path of action (karma) while others take shelter in the path of knowledge (jnana). But as far as we are concerned, we have chosen the sandals of the servants of Lord Hari as the only refuge.&rdquo;</li>

The aspiration to attain to the perfection of becoming an associate servitor of the Lord -
&ldquo;O my Lord, please lead me into the glance of those great devotees who, in their heart&rsquo;s aspiration to only once behold Your divine form, consider sense enjoyment and liberation to be like straw, and whose separation is unbearable for even You.&rdquo;</li>

Sri Bilvamangalasya
The realization of the nature of unconditional devotion -
&ldquo;O Supreme Lord, if our devotion for You were more steadfast, Your adolescent form would naturally arise (appear) within our hearts. Then (there would not be the slightest necessity to pray for the triple pursuits of religiosity, gain, and sensual desire [dharma, artha, kama], and their negation in the form of liberation [mukti], because) mukti will personally attend us (as a concomitant subsidiary fruit of devotion, in the form of deliverance from ignorance), her hands cupped in prayer (like a preordained maidservant); and the fruits of bhukti (transitory pleasure culminating in attainment of heaven) will eagerly await their orders (from us, should any necessity arise for them in the service of Your lotus feet).&rdquo;</li>

&ldquo;Of persons afraid of material existence, some worship the Sruti Scriptures (Vedas), some worship the Smrti Scriptures (supplementary Religious Codes), and others worship the Mahabharata.

As pure chanting ensues, remembrance is attained; thus chanting and remembering, step-by-step ascent is gained.

&ldquo;Higher than Vaikuntha is Mathura city,

Better than Mathura is Vrndavana, the holy place where Lord Hari enjoyed the joyous dance of amorous grace.
Above Vrndavana Dhama is Govardhana Hill,

Even higher than Govardhana Hill is the banks of Radha- kunda
that the Sweetheart of Gokula overfloods sweet love abound. Who would select for his worship, any other place, disregarding this sacred pond at Govardhana&rsquo;s base?
Such a foolish fellow surely can&rsquo;t be found!

none can free us from action and reaction; Cast them all aside, O my brother,
sing the glory of good faith, our mother whose grace alone bestows pure devotion. Banish your pride forever,

The principle to reject everything opposed to the service of the Lord and His devotee, and to similarly abstain from everything opposed to an attitude of surrender, is known as pratikulya - vivarjjanam - Rejection of the Unfavorable.
4.2
pratikulya-varjjana-sankalpadarsah -

Sri Sri Bhagavatas Caitanyacandrasya
The ideal in the resolve to reject the unfavorable -
&ldquo;O Lord of the universe, I have no desire for wealth or worldly promotion, nor do I desire wife, family, and society, nor do I aspire for Vedic religiosity or mundane scholarship. The only aspiration in my heart is that in my every birth I may have unmotivated devotion for You.&rdquo;

When the traditional guru and guardians are found to be unfavorable, they too must surely be abandoned -

It can never be likewise checked or pacified by practicing the eightfold yogic discipline, which is generally based on sensual and mental repression [yama, niyama, etc.].&rdquo;</li>

I may be born in an insect body, that cannot but be Your mercy, in my heart I&rsquo;ll be ever happy.
Devoid of Your devotee&rsquo;s company, in an ignorant non-devotee&rsquo;s family, to be born as even Brahma, the creator:

&ldquo;For defects in his nature, or defects in his body,
one should never disrespect Lord Krsna&rsquo;s pure devotee. If mud, foam, and bubbles appear in Ganges water,

For the pure devotees who have taken refuge in the mellow of pure devotion in Vrndavana, even the reverential service of Lord Narayana in Vaikuntha is considered to be as adverse as the

(Bengali poem by Sri Bhaktivinoda Thakura)
&ldquo;Anything but Krsna&rsquo;s message, know as falsehood such a passage, such a harlot is so very dangerous:
devotion to the Lord Sri Krsna, rarely gotten by the jiva -
that harlot steals away this consciousness.
O dear mind, please hear my prayer:
And if you hear the presentation of the tigress liberation,
all the soul&rsquo;s good prospect she&rsquo;ll devour.
Both temptations please abandon, and not to speak of liberation,
curb attraction for the Lord Narayana;
by attraction to that plane, to Vaikuntha you&rsquo;ll be hurled down - denied the chance to live in Sri Vrndavana.
Love for Radha-Krsna in Vraja, bestows the most precious treasure; adore Them in your heart eternally;
Rupa-Raghunatha&rsquo;s feet, for such devotion, does entreat
this Bhaktivinoda, bereft, in all humility.&rdquo;

For the disturbed soul who is flogged by his six enemies, only the shelter of the lotus feet of his natural Master awards him
immortality in fearlessness and sorrowlessness-
&ldquo;O Supreme Soul, for time immemorial in this material world I have been tormented with sin, stung with remorse, and constantly harassed by my six insatiable enemies (the five senses and the mind). O gracious awarder of shelter, somehow I have come before Your holy lotus feet, which are the embodiment of fearlessness, sorrowlessness, and positive immortality. My Master, please protect this one distressed.&rdquo;</p>

To summarily offer everything - from body and its paraphernalia up to pure soul - unto the lotus feet of Sri Hari, is known as atma-niksepah, or Full Self-surrender. All selfish pursuits are abandoned and every endeavor is for Krsna alone, and that too, up to the point of completely depending on Krsna for one&rsquo;s personal means and ends. Having thus cast oneself unto the holy lotus feet of
one&rsquo;s Lord, one can never be swayed from that position, and he engages in pure devotional service with all his heart forever.

The dignity of casting oneself unto the lotus feet of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, the Hero in the divine pastimes of supreme magnanimity -
&ldquo;He makes no distinction between the worthy and the unworthy, and He does not differentiate between Himself and others; He does not consider who should be given to and who should not, and He makes no preparation for an auspicious or inauspicious moment; and He swiftly awards the rarest nectar of pure devotion beginning with hearing about the Lord, beholding Him, making
obeisance unto Him, and absorbing one&rsquo;s thoughts in Him - that Supreme Lord Gaurahari is my one and only shelter.&rdquo;

bhaktanam arti-bhavas tu, karpanyam kathyate budhaih
&lsquo;O Lord, please protect me, protect me . . .&rsquo;
Such an internal sense of heartbreak in the devotees, which causes their remembrance in love, in all circumstances, of the extension of grace from the unequaled and unexcelled ocean of compassion, Sri Hari, and which characteristically causes them to ever remember their feeling of most lamentable destitution, is known by the learned as karpanyam -Surrender in Humility.
8.3

Sri Sri Bhagavatas Caitanyacandrasya
The holy name of the Lord is the supreme purifier, yet the soul&rsquo;s misfortune is to deny it -
&ldquo;O Lord, Your holy name alone bestows all the good fortune of the soul, and this is why You have revealed Your many different names such as &lsquo;Krsna&rsquo; and &lsquo;Govinda.&rsquo; You have offered all Your transcendental potency in your holy name, without initiating any (scriptural or philosophical) hard and fast rules and regulations, concerning time, place, or circumstance, to be observed in chanting it. Dear Lord, in this way You have given Your mercy to the living entity by making Your name so easily available, and yet, my misfortune in the form of offense (nama-aparadha) does not allow love for that merciful name to be born within my heart.&rdquo;

kasyacit
Humility is the natural symptom of the soul in his awakened state -
&ldquo;O Lord Hari, You are the supreme merciful, second to none, and my condition of life is the most lamentable, second to none. O Lord of the Yadu dynasty, considering this, dispense whatever You deem fit for this sinful wretch.&rdquo;</li>

Sri Prahladasya
The only hope for the soul enslaved by maya is the mercy of the Master of maya -

esanara vasa
tava katha-rati kise haibe amara, kise krsna tava lila kanbo vicara
(Bengali verse by Sri Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Thakura)
&ldquo;Sinful, wicked mind - full of evil thought:
lusting, laughing, crying, fearing - in worldly search is caught. O Krsna, how will I develop attachment to talks of You? how will I e&rsquo;er comprehend Your pastimes ever-new?&rdquo;
(Bengali verse translation)

Sri Prahladasya
A game of misfortune: an adverse mentality in the heart aspiring to serve Krsna -

smarana
(Bengali poem by Sri Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Thakura)
&ldquo;Dragged by tongue towards a taste, by genital to perversion; needlessly the belly craves lavish food consumption.
The skin demands luxurious comforts, the ear demands sweet talks; the nose demands sweet fragrance, as the eye for scenery looks. Like a man with many wives, splayed by their demands -
thus the mind is dragged by the senses&rsquo; commands.
O dear son of Nanda, this is my situation;
how will your sweet pastimes be my heart&rsquo;s contemplation?&rdquo;
(Bengali verse translation)

The regretful submission of incompetence by the devotee who aspires for the service of the Supreme Person -
kasyacit
&ldquo;There is no parallel to my sinful, criminal life. Everything that can be conceived of as bad is found in me. O Supreme Lord, I am even ashamed to come before You to petition, &lsquo;please forgive my offenses.&rsquo; What more can I say than this?&rdquo;

Ajamilasya
The sinful revile themselves when they are exposed to a mere facsimile of the all-auspicious holy name of the Lord (namabhasa) -
&ldquo;Who am I? A cheater, a sinner, a defiler of my brahminical status, a shameless wretch. What is my position in comparison to this holy name of the Lord, &lsquo;Narayana,&rsquo; the embodiment of all auspiciousness?&rdquo;</li>

kvaham daridrah papiyan, kva krsnah sri-niketanah brahma-bandhur iti smaham, bahubhyam parirambhitah
Sri Sudamnah
The Lord&rsquo;s mercy does not consider the disqualification of even a fallen brahmana -
&ldquo;I am the most sinful and destitute, so who am I compared to Krsna, the shelter of the Goddess of Fortune? He knew I was the unqualified son of a brahmana, but nonetheless He embraced me. Indeed, this is most astonishing.&rdquo;
8.10

(Bengah verse by Sri Bhaktivinoda Thakura)
&ldquo;In this life as Lord Brahma, or in any other place, if I&rsquo;m born as beast or bird, that will be Your grace: my only aspiration is to be with Your servants,
and in Your pastimes serve Your feet, as one of Your attendants.&rdquo;

Srimad Uddhavasya
The Lord is merciful upon even the animals who have exclusively surrendered unto Him -
&ldquo;O Lord Krsna, friend of all, in Your form of Lord Rama, even when the tips of the magnificent crowns of the great gods headed by Lord Brahma were subjugated before Your lotus feet, You simply showed Your affection for the monkeys. Thus it is no wonder that You are seen to be subordinate to Your exclusive servitors such as Nanda Maharaja, the Gopis, Bali, and others.&rdquo;</p>

Sri Yamunacaryasya
Even to pray for the Lord&rsquo;s servitorship is felt as an impertinence, when the glory of the Lord is realized by His mercy -
&ldquo;Fie on me - an impure, impertinent, hard-hearted, and shameless fellow. O Supreme Personality, simply governed by my whims do I dare to aspire for Your servitorship, a position practically inconceivable to great, powerful personalities like Lord Brahma, Lord Siva, and the four Kumaras.&rdquo;</li>

Sri Yamumcaryasya
Despite thousands of personal defects, a devotee can never check his desire for the Lord&rsquo;s service -
&ldquo;Uncultured, mean, fickle-minded, envious, ungrateful, proud, subservient to lust, deceitful, hard-hearted, and sinful am I. O Lord, how will I ever be able to cross this insurmountable ocean of misery and attain to the service of Your lotus feet?&rdquo;</li>
<li>Sri Yamunacarya8.14

nanu prayatnah sakrd eva natha tavaham asmiti ca yacamanah tavanukampyah smaratah pratijnam
mad eka varjjam kim idam vratante
Sri Yamunacaryasya
Although the Lord is naturally gracious upon the surrendered soul, the surrendered soul considers himself unfit to receive that grace -
&ldquo;O Lord, one who keeps Your pledge in mind and wholly surrenders unto You, declaring, &lsquo;I am Yours alone,&rsquo; is a fit recipient for Your grace. Is it only I who am not included in Your promise?&rdquo;
Sri Yamunacarya
8.15
suspasta-dainyenatma-vijnaptih -

Heartfelt petition in stark humility -
Sri Yamunacaryasya
&ldquo;O Mukunda, there is no offensive activity in this world that I have not performed thousands of times. Now, finally, I have no alternative but to simply weep before You.&rdquo;</li>
<li></li>

nimajjato &rsquo;nanta bhavarnavantas

tvayapi labdham bhagavann idanim
anuttamam patram idam dayayah
Sri Yamunacaryasya
The realization of feeling oneself to be situated on the outer limit of the unlimitedly merciful Lord&rsquo;s mercy -
&ldquo;O Lord, I was drowning in the fathomless, endless ocean of material existence, and now, after immeasurable time, I have reached the shore - Your Divine Self. And You also have finally obtained the most fit recipient for Your mercy.&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>Sri Yamunacarya
8.17

dinabandhur iti nama te smaran, yadavendra patito &lsquo;ham utsahe bhakta-vatsalataya tvayi srute, mamakam hrdayam asu kampate
Jagannathasya
A devotee of the Lord naturally considers himself to be lowly, and never does he consider himself a devotee -
&ldquo;O Yadavendra, when I think of Your name, Dinabandhu - friend of the fallen, I, who am afallen, feel encouraged. But hearing that You are Bhaktavatsala - affectionate to the devotees, my heart suddenly trembles.&rdquo;
Jagannatha
8.18

stavakas tava caturmukhadayo, bhavaka hi bhagavan bhavadayah sevakah sata-makhadayah sura, vasudeva yadi ke tada vayam
Dhananjayasya
A devotee feels disappointed in the improbability of his ever having a slight relationship with the Supreme Lord who is worshippable by the great gods headed by Lord Siva and Lord Brahma -
&ldquo;O Lord, the demigods headed by four-headed Lord Brahma are engaged in offering their worshipful prayers unto You; the demigods headed by five-headed Lord Siva are absorbed in
meditation upon You; and the demigods headed by Lord Indra, the performer of a hundred sacrifices, are Your order carriers. O Lord Vasudeva, who then, are we to You?&rdquo;

Sri Prabodhanandapadanam
Seeing the Lord&rsquo;s most munificent descent as Sri Gauranga who is the bestower of the paramount gift of love divine, the devotee, feeling insatiable desire for the mercy of this Lord, considers himself to be drastically deceived -
&ldquo;Deceived, deceived, no doubt, deceived am I! The whole universe became flooded with the love of Sri Gauranga, but alas, my fate was not to get even the slightest touch of it.&rdquo;
Sri Prabodhananda Saraswati
8.20

Sri Prataparudrasya
The lament of one deeply aspiring for the service of Sri Gaurahari, in the apprehension of not attaining that service -
&ldquo;He casts His merciful glance upon even low-born persons who
are unfit to be seen; yet He will not grant me His audience. Has the Lord (Sri Caitanyadeva) made His advent deciding that He will give His grace to all but me?&rdquo;
8.21

Sri Sanatanapadanam
Realizing his loving Lord&rsquo;s extreme magnanimity, deep humility is expressed by the intimate servitor of the Lord -
&ldquo;Even this overburdened ass takes shelter of the lotus feet of Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, by whose grace the formidable ocean of material existence can be crossed very easily.&rdquo;</li>

Sri Prabodhanandapadanam
One who begs for a drop of the nectar of divine love supreme perceives his own destitution -
&ldquo;Now that Sri Caitanyacandra - the unlimitedly expansive ocean of the joy of divine love supreme - has made His gracious advent, anyone who remains destitute is surely a genuine pauper.&rdquo;
Sri Prabodhananda Saraswati
8.23

Sri Madhavendra Puripadanam
The heart&rsquo;s eruption in the sorrow of separation, even for one who has achieved the ultimate perfection of love in separation -
&ldquo;O gentle-hearted Lord, ever-gracious upon the destitute, O Lord of Mathura, when shall I see You again? In Your absence my broken heart trembles. Beloved! what shall I do now?&rdquo;</li>

A devotee in separation of Krsna helplessly draws the grace of the Lord of his life -
&ldquo;O Hari, O guardian of the shelterless, O one and only ocean of mercy, how will I pass my unblest days and nights without a glimpse of You?&rdquo;
8.25</p>

Like a maidservant, even Sri Radhika, the heroine of the son of King Nanda, humbly petitions the Lord in His separation -
&ldquo;O Lord, my loving consort and dearmost hero, where are You? I am Your poor maidservant, please come to Me.&rdquo;</li>

<p>Sri Gopikanam
Like persons attached to hearth and home, even the Gopis, the damsels beloved of Lord Sri Krsna, humbly petition the Lord in His separation -
&ldquo;O lotus-navelled one, Your lotus feet, eternally held as the object of meditation within the hearts of the greatest yogis of profound intellect, are the only resort for delivering those souls fallen into the well of material life. May those holy lotus feet graciously appear within the hearts of we ordinary household ladies.&rdquo;

A devotee afflicted in separation feels himself to be drastically helpless -

Sri Sri Bhagavatas Caitanyacandrasya
Because everything appears vacant in the separation of Sri Krsna, divine love&rsquo;s attempt becomes prolonged sorrow in desperate shelterlessness -
&ldquo;O Govinda, my every moment seems to be a great millennium. Tears flow from my eyes like torrents of rain, and the whole world seems empty in the absence of You.&rdquo;

When, in His separation, Krsna&rsquo;s faithful sweetheart realizes Her whole urge for living has been thwarted, even to maintain her body is felt to be a shamefully lamentable task -
&ldquo;My dear companion, without the service of Sri Krsna&rsquo;s divine form, nature, and pastimes, all my senses have become senseless. Now, how will I be able to shamelessly bear the burden of these wood-like, stone-like senses?&rdquo;</p>

His sweetheart who lives despite intensely feeling His separation thinks that even Her tears are only due to Her pride -
&ldquo;When He was about to leave, He said, &lsquo;I am going.&rsquo; I heard His words without a care. As He left, from afar He glanced back again and again, but I paid no attention.

Sri Sri Bhagavatas Caitanyacandrasya
A person who has attained to the acme of love for Krsna appears as one bereft of that love, due to the moment by moment growing insatiable desire to taste it; this indicates love for Krsna to be the bestower of the supreme fortune, and the most rarely attained goal of life -
&ldquo;O My companion, I do not have the slightest scent of love for Krsna - and yet, I cry. This is only for the purpose of exhibiting my great fortune. Without seeing the lovely face of Krsna playing His flute, I worthlessly pass My days, like an insignificant insect.&rdquo;

pleasing their hearts by fulfilling all their cherished desires for devotional service.

Motivation for sense gratification is the only reason that the worshippers of the many demigods surrender to those gods instead of to Lord Krsna -
&ldquo;Persons whose good sense is perverted by some material desire become preoccupied with that desire, and thus they adopt the appropriate rules and regulations to worship &lsquo;other gods&rsquo;.&rdquo;

The elevationists worship &lsquo;many gods&rsquo; due to their ignorance of Sri Krsna&rsquo;s position as the Supreme God of all gods -
&ldquo;I alone am the enjoyer and the Lord of all sacrifices. Those who worship the demigods, considering them to be independent of Me, are known as superficial worshippers (pratikopasaka). They do not understand My factual position, and thus due to their fallacious worship they deviate from the truth. When they worship as My expansions the demigods headed by the Sungod, they may ultimately gain an auspicious result.&rdquo;

&ldquo;This trimodal deluding energy (maya) of Mine is practically insurmountable. Only those who surrender unto Me can overcome
it.&rdquo;
9.12

tatraiva 7.19
Absolute surrender unto the lotus feet of Sri Krsna is the purpose of knowledge (jnana) the great soul who realizes this truth is exceedingly rare -
&ldquo;Having passed through many lifetimes of assiduous spiritual practices, by the influence of sadhu-sanga, the association of saints, one attains to knowledge of My identity, and thus surrenders utterly unto Me. Thereafter, he reaches Me, and realizes that everything without exception is related to Vasudeva, and thus everything that be is of the nature of Vasudeva. Such a great soul is exceedingly rare.&rdquo;
9.13

tatraiva 18.54
A person who has realized his constitutional spiritual nature engages in transcendental devotional service unto the lotus feet of Sri Krsna; therefore, such devotion is transcendental to the three modes of material nature -
&ldquo;By knowledge of the non-differentiated Absolute Truth, one can achieve self-satisfaction, freedom from lamentation and hankering, and perceive the equality in all beings. And above this, he engages in transcendental devotional service unto Me.&rdquo;
9.14

brahmano hi pratisthaham, amrtasyavyayasya ca sasvatasya ca dharmasya, sukhasyaikantikasya ca
tatraiva 14.27
Sri Krsna, the embodiment of the entire compass of divine mellows, is the absolute source of the undifferentiated Brahman that the liberationists desire to merge into as the fourth state of the soul -
&ldquo;Transcendental to the modes of nature as the Axiomatic Truth replete with the divine variegatedness of holy name, form, nature, associates, and pastimes, I alone am the mainstay and fountainhead of Brahman - the ultimate destination of the liberationists (jnanis).
Immortality, immutability, eternality, the eternal sustenance of divine love, and the ultimate ecstasy of the divine mellows of Vrndavana (Vraja-rasa) - all these are supported by Me: the Transcendental, Variegated, Axiomatic Reality - Krsna.&rdquo;

tatraiva 15.15
Encompassing the aggregate individuality and collectivity, the Absolute Autocracy over both the material and the spiritual planes is held by Sri Krsna alone, the Supreme Male Dominating Principle as corroborated in the Upanisads; and He is the objective sought after by the yogis -
&ldquo;I am situated as the Supreme Lord within the hearts of all souls. As a result of a soul&rsquo;s worldly deeds, his remembrance, knowledge, and forgetfulness arise from Me alone. Thus, I am not only Brahman, the Absolute Spirit that pervades the universe, but above that, I am the Supersoul present in the hearts of the living beings, who dispenses the results of their attempts. And even above My worshippable aspects of Brahman and Paramatma, I am the Guru of all souls, the eternal dispenser of their good fortune - I am Bhagavan, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, to be known by all the Vedas; I am the creator and perfect knower of all the axiomatic conclusions of the Vedas (Vedanta).&rdquo;

tatraiva 15.4
The desired goal is the supreme, divine lotus feet of Lord Visnu, who is the ordainer of ultimate emancipation for the liberationists (jnanis), the Supreme Lord of the meditationists (yogis), and the rewarder of the elevationists (karmis) -
&ldquo;Thus one should search out that supreme goal of no return - the lotus feet of Lord Visnu: &lsquo;I surrender unto Him, the Original
Person from whom the perpetual material world has extended&rsquo;.&rdquo;
9.17

tatraiva 15.19
Those liberated from ignorance and endowed with full-fledged knowledge render service in all devotional mellows headed by consorthood (madhura-rasa), unto Sri Krsna, the Supreme Hero of divine pastimes (Lila-purusottama) -
&ldquo;O Bharata, one who is liberated from illusion, and thus knows Me alone as the Supreme Personality - such a full-fledged savant serves me in all respects (mellows).&rsquo;
9.18

tatraiva 6.47
Of all yogis who follow the paths based on action, knowledge, and meditation (karma, jnana, dhyana), the topmost are those who (abandon their respective attitudes in order to) take refuge in their heart&rsquo;s faith in My personal potency (svarupa-sakti), and thus engage in my pure devotional service -
&ldquo;In My opinion, of all types of yogis, the most elevated of all is he who surrenders his heart to Me and serves Me in devotion with sincere, internal faith.&rdquo;
9.19

tatraiva 12.2
My associates who serve Me in uninterrupted loving devotion are the most
superior -
&ldquo;Dedicating his whole life to devotional service with unalloyed faith, one who absorbs his heart in Me is definitely the highest of all devotees.&rdquo;
9.20

tatraiva 7.7
The original form of Godhead, Sri Krsna, is the origin of all incarnations, the ultimate refuge, and the enjoyer of dynamic divinity-
&ldquo;O Dhananjaya, there is none superior to Me. Everything that be is linked with Me in My Visnu form, like gems strung on a thread.&rdquo;
9.21
svayam-rupasya svarupa-sakti-pravarttanam asritya raga-bhajanam eva parama-pandityam -
aham sarvasya prabhavo, mattah sarvam pravarttate iti matva bhajante mam, budha bhava-samanvitah
tatraiva 10.8
The ultimate sagacity is in Raga-bhajana, spontaneous devotion (headed by servitude unto Sri Radhika), under the impetus of the personal potency of the Original Lord who is beauty&rsquo;s own self-
&ldquo;Know Me as the source of everything that be, spiritual or material. Understanding this, the truly intelligent souls give their hearts to Me: they engage in My pure devotional service.&rdquo;
(As soon as persons with the propensity for service in love [bhava- bhajan ] realize the original form of Godhead [svayam-rupa] to be the fountainhead of all currents of worship and devotion, then, in the mellow of divine consorthood [madhura-rasa ], they will necessarily feel deep loyalty to intimately follow the impetus of full-blown service, this impetus being the Lord&rsquo;s personal potency [svarupa-sakti] or the Female Embodiment of the acme in devotion [ mahabhava-svarupa . In this way, they attain to the servitude of Srimati Radharani [Sri Radha-dasya]. The purport is that the potency of Sri Krsna is also the Inauguratress of worship and devotion unto Him, and to engage in pure devotional service always in the shelter of such a conception in pure heart&rsquo;s devotion constitutes servitude to the Guru for the Gaudiya Vaisnavas, or Sri Radha-dasya in madhura-rasa.)

tatraiva 10.9
My male or female servitors, who have dedicated their entire lives to Me and taken full shelter in Me, mutually assist one another in a manner befitting their respective internal devotional aptitudes. They eternally relish conversing about Me, the satisfaction of serving Me, and the nectar of devotion culminating in My divine consorthood -
These are the symptoms of these exclusive devotees:
&ldquo;With heart and soul dedicated unto Me, they constantly exchange their devotional ecstasies while conversing about Me. By such hearing and chanting, in the stage of practice (sadhana) they enjoy the happiness of devotion; and in the stage of perfection
(sadhya), that is, in the achievement of divine love (prema), they relish up to the mellow of My intimate relationship in divine consorthood, in the free spontaneity of Vraja.&rdquo;

Only loving service (bhava-seva) can subjugate the Supreme Lord -
&ldquo;Whatever the pure-hearted devotees lovingly offer unto Me, such as Tulasi leaf, flower, fruit, and water, I accept with heartfelt affection.&rdquo;

tatraiva 9.30
By the potency of the purging effect of devotion for Krsna, glaring inauspicious traits may arise in the character of a person who is exclusively devoted to the service of the Lord. Although such faults may seem to be abominable, they are not condemnable as born of evil motivations (as in a non-devotee). On the contrary, due to the natural, marvelous pristine glory of his exclusive devotion (ananya- bhajana), that devotee is to be known as a true saint -
&ldquo;If a person serves Me with heart exclusively devoted, even if his practices are abominable he is to be revered as a true saint (sadhu) because his life&rsquo;s resolve is perfect in all respects.&rdquo;

tatraiva 9.31
The supreme assurance: the purging of dirt by a process of purification and the natural emanation of dirt from a contaminated thing can never be one. Such a devotee is swiftly purified - he is never lost -
&ldquo;O son of Kunti, it is My promise that a soul who adopts exclusive devotion unto Me will definitely never fail. Despite the initial purging and sudden appearance of his defects, such anomalies are rapidly dispelled by his continuous remembrance of Me in repentance for the impediments to his service. He becomes
impeccably devout in the soul&rsquo;s natural constitutional behavior, and as a result of his devotion he attains supreme relief from the bondage of both sinfulness and piety.&rdquo;

tatraiva 9.32
By taking shelter of Sri Krsna, the embodiment of unadulterated, concentrated pure goodness, even the most depraved reach the supreme destination -
&ldquo;O Partha, by expressly taking refuge in exclusive devotion for Me, even low-born barbarous peoples that subsist on cow&rsquo;s flesh,corrupt women such as prostitutes, and humans of lower order such as merchants and laborers - they all swiftly reach the supreme destination. Nothing can impede those who take shelter in devotion unto Me.&rdquo;

tatraiva 18.61
The conditioned souls are enslaved by material nature, but the Lord is the controller of both nature and the living beings -
&ldquo;O Arjuna, I am situated in the hearts of all souls as the Supersoul, the Lord and Master of all souls. For every endeavor of the living beings in this world, the Lord (My plenary expansion, the Supersoul) awards an appropriate result. As an object mounted on a wheel is caused to revolve, the living beings are caused to revolve in the universe by the almighty power of the Lord. Incited by Him, your destiny will naturally be effected according to your endeavors.&rdquo;

tatraiva 18.62
The pure spirit souls have finite independence due to their constitutional nature as atomic conscious entities; by proper utilization of that independence, they take shelter of the Supreme Lord and thus attain to the supreme peace -
&ldquo;O Bharata, surrender unto that Lord in all respects. By His grace you will attain to supreme peace and the eternal abode.&rdquo;

The most hidden of all hidden treasures of the Lord: the most affectionate advice of the devotee&rsquo;s dear friend -
&ldquo;I have revealed to you My hidden teaching of the non- differentiated Absolute, and My more hidden teaching of the Almighty Dominion. Now hear the most hidden of all hidden treasures concerning Me, the Sweet Absolute. Of all the teachings I have imparted within this Gita-sastra, this is topmost. You are most dear to Me, and thus I am explaining this for your best benefit.&rdquo;

Beyond all doubt, the highest attainment is to serve the (supramundane [aprakrta]) desires of the Sweet Absolute Cupid -
&ldquo;Be My devotee, give Me your heart. Do not think of Me as the karma-yogis, jnana-yogis, and dhyana-yogis do. Sacrifice your every endeavor for Me, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is my vow that without a doubt You will then achieve the servitude of My own Self, which is the embodiment of truth, sentience, and beauty. Because you are most dear to Me do I reveal this transcendental devotion to you.&rdquo;

tatraiva 18.66
The only way to gain relief from all adversities, the only way to find the hidden treasure, is to abandon all consideration of religiosity or irreligiosity and surrender unto the lotus feet of the Absolute Reality the Beautiful Sri Krsnacandra, the divine son of King Nanda -
&ldquo;To impart knowledge of My all-comprehensive aspect, Brahman, as well as knowledge of My all-permeating aspect, Paramatma, whatever teachings I have given, based in general on: the duties of the socio-religious ranks of life, the duty of the mendicant, selflessness, internal and external sense-control, meditation, subservience to the dominion of the Almighty - now I ask you to summarily dismiss every one of those religiosities and surrender unto Me, the Personality of Godhead, Bhagavan. Then I shall deliver You from all sin of this worldly sojourn, as well as any sin incurred by giving up the aforementioned duties or religiosities. There will be no cause for you to lament that your life&rsquo;s mission is unfulfilled.&rdquo;

Sri Hari is the cause of all worlds, gross and subtle -
&ldquo;Prior to the creation of this universe, only I existed. The gross, the subtle, and even the indefinable non-differentiated Absolute, Brahman - nothing whatsoever existed separately from Me. After the creation, I exist as the aggregate entity; and after the cataclysm, only I shall remain.&rdquo;

The aggregate of knowledge propounded by the Vedas - relation, means, and end (sambandha, abhidheya, prayojana) - arises from Him alone -
&ldquo;To be merciful upon you do I teach you the most esoteric knowledge of Me, including - the realization of My nature and entourage (sambandha-tattva), the inconceivable mystery of loving devotion or prema-bhakti (prayojana-tattva), and its constituent part in the form of devotional practice or sadhana-bhakti (abhidheya-tattva). Now hear My message attentively, and accept what I impart to you.&rdquo;

The teaching of eternal religion, nondifferent from Sri Krsna, is received from Sri Krsna by Lord Brahma -
&ldquo;The message of the Vedas is eternal religion, nondifferent from Me. When in the course of time those eternal teachings disappeared from view with the universal cataclysm, I imparted them to Lord Brahma at the dawning of a new creation.&rdquo;

&ldquo;My dear saints, where can the materialists find the happiness that I, the embodiment of divine ecstasy, bestow within the hearts of those who offer life and soul unto Me, and who have thus become indifferent to all else?&rdquo;

tatraiva 11.20.32-33
When a devotee desires any object which is attainable by the practitioners of religiosity based on karma, jnana, and yoga, all his requirements are summarily achieved -
&ldquo;By engaging in devotional service, my devotee effortlessly attains anything and everything attainable in this world by virtuous practices such as duty, austerity, learning, detachment, meditation, charity, or religiosity. Even residence in Vaikunthaloka is his for the asking, to say nothing of the attainment of heaven or liberation.&rdquo;
9.38

The exclusive devotees never aspire for liberation headed by
emancipation in the Absolute, even if it is offered to them -
&ldquo;Even if I desire to award it to them, my sagacious, saintly, exclusive devotees will never accept the ultimate emancipation of oneness in Brahman.&rdquo;
9.39

tatraiva 9.4.67
Nor do they aspire for even positive liberation, beginning with residence in the Lord&rsquo;s abode, which is infinitely superior to ultimate emancipation of oneness in Brahman -
&ldquo;When My dedicated pure devotee never accepts any of the four kinds of positive liberation (salokya, etc.) even if they avail themselves to him by dint of his service unto Me, then why will he ever wish for materialistic enjoyment and ultimate emancipation in Brahman (sayujya-mukti), which are very swiftly vanquished by the march of time? By sayujya-mukti, the soul&rsquo;s eternal status falls into the jaws of death. Thus, sense enjoyment and monistic liberation hold no permanence.&rdquo;

&ldquo;I, who am dear to the sadhus, can be reached only by devotion born of unalloyed faith. Even a dog-flesh-eating outcast who dedicates himself to exclusive devotion for Me is delivered from the

Intense devotion delivers even persons of uncontrolled senses from worldly enjoyment -
&ldquo;A person adopting the path of devotion may suffer the obstacle of his mind loitering somewhat in thoughts of mundanity, due to former habits of sensual dalliance. As he cultivates devotion, his service aptitude develops. And the more his boldness to serve increases, the more that materialistic devotee is gradually able to curb his attraction for the mundane. The only cause of failure for such aspirants is their lack of sincerity.&rdquo;

tatraiva 11.20.27-30
For one who receives the seed of devotion, who is selfless and penitent, denouncing his inability to abandon mundane enjoyment despite realizing it to be the embodiment of suffering, and who sincerely gives himself incessantly to all the practices of devotion - in the heart of such a devotee, the Supreme Lord ascends like the rising sun to annihilate all ignorance with its reactions, revealing His divine personality in all its pristine glory -
&ldquo;He who has imbibed heart&rsquo;s faith in the tidings of My name, nature, and pastimes; who has become indifferent to all kinds of fruitive work and its rewards; who has learnt that all forms of enjoyment of sensual passions ultimately transform into misery, yet he is unable to fully abandon such passions - such a faithful devotee, being determined that his shortcomings will be dispelled by the potency of devotion, gradually comes to abhor those evil passions that enslave him, knowing the havoc they wreak - and he serves Me with love: when his objective is pure and sincere, I give him My
mercy.
&ldquo;In this way, the introspective devotee unceasingly absorbs himself in all the practices of devotional service as enunciated by Me. And I, who am situated in the heart of My devotee, strike at the root of all the material urges that infect his heart, reducing them to oblivion.
&ldquo;By bringing Me - the Soul of all souls - into his heart, no evil can remain there. Swiftly is the hard knot of mundane ego severed, all doubts are slashed, and all mundane action is exhausted for that earnestly aspiring devotee.&rdquo;

tatraiva 11.20.31
Since pursuits based on knowledge-cum-renunciation are sometimes agents of obstruction to pure devotion, they can never be integral parts of devotion -
&ldquo;The practice of dry gnosticism and stoic abnegation (jnana and vairagya) are unnecessary, and generally cannot be beneficial, for the faithful devotee who dedicates his heart and all his activities to the service of My lotus feet.&rdquo; (Even if jnana and vairagya are superficially employed in a preliminary stage, they are nonetheless not to be considered integral parts of pure devotion, which stands independently in her divine superexcellence.)

It is faith that qualifies one for exclusive devotion, not birth or any other worldly qualification</h2>
<h2 id="sva-priya-parikarena-vina-sri-bhagavato-py-atma-sattayam-apy-anabhilasah-">&ldquo;O Uddhava, simply by their unalloyed hearts did the cowherd ladies, the cows of Vraja, the trees headed by the Yamalarjunas, the animals, the snakes headed by the evil Kaliya, and various objects of stultified intelligence headed by the shrubs and creepers of

One must worship Lord Hari, even if it is necessary to abandon scripturally enjoined prescribed duties to do so -
&ldquo;In the Scriptures of Religion, I, the Supreme Lord, have instructed men of all statuses of life in their duties. Duly
comprehending the purificatory virtue of executing those prescribed duties as well as the vice of neglecting them, one who abandons all allegiance to such dutifulness in order to engage in My devotional service is the best of honest men (sadhu).&rdquo;

tatraiva 11.12.14-15
The original form of the Lord is Vraja-kisora, the adolescent cowherd boy of Vrndavana, and He is the Soul of all souls and of all incarnations of God as well. Actually forsaking the Vedic and alliedscriptural injunctions of allegiance to husband and venerable personages headed by the demigods, one should, as the soul&rsquo;s pursuit in divine consorthood - the natural aggregate of all devotional mellows - follow the path of aspiring for union with that
transcendental cowherd exclusively for His transcendental pleasure, and serve Him in pure devotion like a play-doll in His hands. He unfailingly protects one from the fear of all tribulation, demons, society, husband, son and family -
&ldquo;O Uddhava, totally abandoning the precepts of religiosity incited by the Vedas and corroborated in the Smrti Scriptures, rejecting all injunctions and prohibitions, either well-known or yet to be known, take exclusive refuge in Me, the Soul of all beings - Sri Krsna, the Sweet Absolute. When you can do that with every mellow of your heart, you will be situated in My heart and thus not threatened from any quarter.&rdquo;

martyo yada tyakta-samasta-karma niveditatma vicikirsito me tadamrtatvam pratipadyamano mamatma-bhuyaya ca kalpate vai
tatraiva 11.29.34
Utterly abandoning desire for worldly enjoyment or liberation, or the desire to become one of the demigods, the souls who embrace the service of Sri Krsna realize their eternal divine identity and attain confidential servitude to the Lord, gaining admission into the group of the followers of Srila Rupa Goswami -
&ldquo;When the mortal being gives up all worldly attempts, completely offers himself to Me, and acts exclusively according to My desire, he attains to the state of nectar, or positive immortality. He is then accepted: he becomes qualified to enjoy the acme of divine
ecstasy, united with Me as My family member.&rdquo;

<p>naham atmanam asase, mad-bhaktaih sadhubhir vina sriyan catyantikim brahman, yesam gatir aham para
tatraiva 9.4.64
Even the Supreme Lord does not wish to lead a life without the company of His beloved associates -
&ldquo;O best of the brahmanas, without the company of those sadhus for whom I alone am the only shelter, I desire neither the bliss of My own nature nor My eternal six opulences.&rdquo;
9.54

ye daragara-putrapta-, pranan vittam imam param hitva mam saranam yatah, katham tams tyaktum utsahe
tatraiva 9.4.65
In exclusive devotion, the Supreme Lord and His devotees cannot tolerate each other&rsquo;s separation -
&ldquo;They have left home, son, wife, relatives, wealth, life, this world, the next world - just to surrender to Me. How can I ever dream of leaving them?&rdquo;
9.55

tatraiva
Divine consorthood is the principle subduer of Sri Hari, and the vision of those who adopt it is perfect and complete -
&ldquo;As a chaste wife charms her virtuous husband, the sadhus of poised vision who adore Me with all their hearts similarly charm Me by the influence of their love.&rdquo;

tatraiva 9.4.63
The Original Supreme Lord of divine pastimes - the son of the King of Vraja - is by nature submissive to his surrendered souls, by His own sweet will. In the manifestation of the Lord&rsquo;s eternal fundamental identity, it is revealed that because love is everything to Him, law is naturally dependent upon and thus subordinate to love, and a brahmana is subordinate to the devotee of the Lord -
&ldquo;O My dear brahmana, I am subordinate to My devotee, and therefore I am like one who has no independence. The sadhu devotees have captured My heart. And not to speak of My devotees, those who are devoted to My devotees are also dear to Me.&rdquo;

tatraiva
For the devotees who have surrendered to the lotus feet of Sri Krsna, who have given up their families and prescribed duties for Him, and who within their deep absorption in His service feel brokenhearted by His separation, the Lord&rsquo;s message of supreme reassurance is His pledge as the most intimate family member to maintain the life of His devotee by giving His own name, affection, associates, body, and the ambrosia of His pastimes -
The Supreme Lord Sri Hari, the vanquisher of the anguish of His surrendered souls, told His dearmost surrendered soul (Uddhava, the messenger):
&ldquo;I personally maintain those who have given up their prescribed duties and social obligations for Me.&rdquo;

Chapter 10
Avasesamrtam - Divine Remnants of Nectar
sankirtyamano bhagavan anantah
srutanubhavo-vyasanam hi pumsam pravisya cittam vidhunoty asesam yatha tamo &lsquo;rko &lsquo;bhram ivati-vatah
Bhagavatam, 12.12.48
When the singing of the glorious qualities of the Supreme Lord Hari&rsquo;s personality is heard, He enters into the hearts of men to banish all their miseries, as the sun dispels the darkness and strong winds disperse the clouds.
10.2
mrsa-giras ta hy asatir asat-katha na kathyate yad bhagavan adhoksajah tad eva satyam tad uhaiva mangalam tad eva punyam bhagavad-gunodayam
Bhagavatam, 12.12.49
&ldquo;Those words in which the glory of the transcendental Lord Sri Hari are not sung - such imaginary, deceptive utterances are to be known as falsehood. And those words in which the divine qualities of the Lord appear - such expressions are to be known as truth, the bestower of all success, and the source of all virtue.&rdquo;
10.3
tad eva ramyam ruciram navam navam
tad eva sasvan manaso mahotsavam
tad eva sokarnava-sosanam nrnam
yad uttamah-sloka-yaso &rsquo;nugiyate
Bhagavatam, 12.12.50
&ldquo;Those words in which the renown of Uttamahsloka Sri Hari (He, the singing of whose glories destroys the ignorance of the world) are broadcast at every second - such expressions alone constantly bestow newer and newer nectar, they inaugurate the heart&rsquo;s grand festival, and they dissolve the ocean of lamentation.&rdquo;
10.4
na tad vacas-citra-padam harer-yaso
jagat-pavitram pragrnita karhicit
tad anksa-tirtham na tu hamsa-sevitam yatracyutas tatra hi sadhavo &lsquo;malah
Bhagavatam, 12.12.51
&ldquo;Those utterances that despite their charming, ornamental presentation never describe the renown of Sri Hari, which alone purifies the universe - such words attract only crow-like, superficial men, but they are never attended by the learned. This is because the immaculate-hearted sadhus adore the melodious words that sing the glories of the Supreme Lord.&rdquo;
10.5
yasah sriyam eva parisramah paro
varnasramacara-tapah-srutadisu avismrtih sridhara-padapadmayor

Bhagavatam, 12.12.54
&ldquo;The prescribed duties of the Varnasrama hierarchy, performance of austerity, and study of the Scriptures - belabored adherence to such practices merely panders to one&rsquo;s reputation and influence. But by the divine services beginning with devotedly hearing the glories of the Lord, the supreme reward of never forgetting the lotus feet of Sri Hari is gained.&rdquo;
10.6

Bhagavatam, 3.15.43
&ldquo;A beautiful fragrance emanated from the Tulasi united with the stamens of the lotus flowerlike feet of the lotus-eyed Supreme
Lord. When the breeze carrying that divine fragrance entered the nostrils (of the Catuh-sana), it caused jubilation in their hearts, and the hairs of their bodies stood erect, despite their zealous attachment to the non-differentiated Brahman.&rdquo;
10.7
atmaramas ca munayo, nirgrantha apy urukrame kurvanty ahaitukim bhaktim, ittham-bhuta-guno harih
Bhagavatam, 1.7.10
&ldquo;Those sages who, being merged in the bliss of the spirit soul, are totally free from the binding knot of mental images - they too engage in the unmotivated service of Sri Krsna, the performer of marvelous deeds. This is but one of the qualities of the Supreme Lord Hari, who charms the entire world.&rdquo;
10.8
srnvatah sraddhaya nityam, grnatas ca sva-cestitam natidirghena kalena, bhagavan visate hrdi
Bhagavatam, 2.8.4
&ldquo;Swiftly does the Lord enter into the hearts of those who with faith constantly hear and chant the glories of His personality.&rdquo;

nigama-kalpa-taror galitam phalam suka-mukhad-amrta-drava-samyutam

Bhagavatam, l.1.3
&ldquo;This Holy Scripture, which describes the glories of the Supreme Lord, has descended intact from the wish-fulfilling tree of the Vedas, and it is enhanced by the nectar of the lotus mouth of Sri Sukadeva Goswami. O connoisseurs of the mellows of devotion,
please constantly relish this fruit, which is the embodiment of those mellows. O devotees blessed with heart&rsquo;s devotion, as long as you are not utterly dissolved in the reality of ecstasy, that is, as long as your hearts are not merged in devotional mellow, then taste the Srimad- Bhagavatam in your life in this world (as a pure votary of Divinity); and even when your hearts are overflooded, you will perpetually continue to drink this supreme nectar divine.&rdquo;

Comprised of five nectars (pancamrtam) respectively entitled Upakramamrtam, Sri Sastra-vacanamrtam, Sri Bhakta- vacanamrtam, Sri Bhagavad-vacanamrtam, and Avasesamrtam (Prelude to Approaching Nectar, The Nectar of Scriptural Word, Words of Nectar from the Devotees, Words of Nectar from the Supreme Lord, and The Divine Remnants of Nectar), the supreme fruit that gives life to the devotees and delights their hearts has been served in this book.

Within four hundred years after Sri Caitanyahari returned to His holy abode, a great soul descended in divine succession from Srila Gaura Kisora Babaji Maharaja, as the potency of Lord Krsna&rsquo;s mercy incarnate. Recognized as the joy of Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura and renowned throughout the universe as Srimad Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati, he flooded this earth planet
with boundless Sri Krsna-sankirtana.

A great fortune came down upon me. Although it was the rarest thing, I received the nectar of that great soul&rsquo;s mercy through his gracious ordinance: &lsquo;By performing Sankirtana in sadhu-sanga, may you fulfill the ultimate goal of your life - Sri Krsna-prema.&rsquo; So now, I try to practice this; may I be forgiven for any offenses in my attempt.

&ldquo;The bees, intoxicated in the festival of drinking the honey of the Lord&rsquo;s lotus feet, busily humming the glories of the Lord, drops of honey from their mouths fall and scatter all around; for my own divine prospect, I&rsquo;ve carefully collected some of those drops herein - and thus do I worship the dust of the holy lotus feet
of those saints, again and again.&rdquo;

In the preparation of this book, those who have infused vitality

Prayer unto the Lotus Feet of my Lord and Master Srila Prabhupada</p>
<ol>
<li>His lotus feet are served in devotion by multitudes of high, virtuous souls; he is the establisher of the religion of the age (as Sri Krsna-sankirtana); he is the presiding monarch (of the Visva Vaisnava-Raja-Sabha - the universal society of the pure devotees that are the true &lsquo;kings&rsquo; or guides of all); and he is the fulfiller of the most cherished desires of those who dispel fear (for all souls). I make my obeisance unto the lotus feet of that illustrious great soul, worshippable by one and all - perpetually do I make my obeisance unto the radiance emanating from the toenails of the holy feet of my Lord.
2He is the leader of the fortunate souls blessed with the treasure of internal pure devotion; he is greatly merciful upon the fallen souls, being their only shelter; and his inconceivable holy feet are the shelter for the deceivers, by deceiving them. I make my obeisance unto his lotus feet - perpetually do I make my obeisance unto the radiance emanating from the toenails of the holy feet of my Lord.</li>
<li>I make my obeisance unto his divine, charming yet commanding lofty form of golden hue. That beautiful figure shames the mad ecstasy of golden lotus stems. Venerated by tens of millions of Cupids, the moons of the toenails of my Worshipful Divine Master reveal the beauty of his lotus feet. Perpetually do I make my obeisance unto that effulgence emanating from the toenails of the holy feet of my Lord.</li>
<li>Like the moon that delights the stars, he is surrounded by his circle of personal servitors, making their hearts bloom in divine ecstasy. The malicious non-devotees are made to flee in panic by the sound of his thunderous roar, and the simple, inoffensive souls attain the ultimate fortune by accepting his lotus feet. I make my obeisance unto him; perpetually do I make my obeisance unto the brilliance emanating from the toenails of the holy lotus feet of my Lord.</li>
<li>He has revealed the vast, magnificent beauty of Sri Gaura Dhama; he has broadcast the tidings of the supreme magnanimity of Sri Gauranga throughout the whole universe; and in the hearts of the fit recipients of his grace, he has firmly established the lotus feet of Sri Gaura. I make my obeisance unto him; perpetually do I make my obeisance unto the effulgence emanating from the toenails of the holy feet of my Lord.</li>
<li>He is the eternal shelter and the Universal Guru for the souls surrendered unto Sri Gauranga. Absorbed in the service of his Gurudeva, Sri Gaura Kisora, he wholeheartedly adores Sri Bhaktivinoda Thakura. I make my obeisance unto him; perpetually
do I make my obeisance unto the effulgence emanating from the toenails of the holy feet of my Lord.</li>
<li>He is the illustrious personality to raise the flag that sings the glory of Sri Rupa, Sri Sanatana, and Sri Raghunatha. His glory is sung throughout the world as nondifferent from the powerful personality of brilliant erudition, Sri Jiva. And he has won the renown of being one with the hearts of Srila Krsnadasa Kaviraja and Thakura Narottama. I make my obeisance unto him; perpetually do I bow down to the brilliance emanating from the toenails of the holy feet of my Divine Master.</li>
<li>Bestowing his grace upon all souls, he is Hari-kirtana incarnate. As the associate of Sri Gaura, he relieves Mother Earth of the burden of offenses committed upon her. And he is so gracious that his endearance of all beings excels that of even a father. I make my obeisance unto him - the mine of all these qualities; perpetually do I bow down to the effulgence emanating from the toenails of the holy feet of my Divine Master.</li>
<li>Like a wish-fulfilling tree for his surrendered servitors (he fulfills their heart&rsquo;s aspirations), even a tree is shamed by his magnanimity and forbearance. And great personalities who are competent to confer boons - they, too, worship his lotus feet. I make my obeisance unto him; perpetually do I bow down to the radiance emanating from the toenails of the holy feet of my Divine Master.</li>
<li>The crownjewel of the paramahamsas, the Prince of the treasure of the supreme perfection of life, Sri Krsna-prema, he accepted the robes of a mendicant sannyasi just to deliver the fallen souls. The topmost tridandi sannyasis attend his lotus feet. I make my obeisance unto him; perpetually do I bow down to the effulgence emanating from the toenails of the holy feet of my Divine Master.</li>
<li>He is the dearmost intimate follower of the Divine Daughter of
Sri Vrsabhanu, and I know myself as the most fortunate by taking the dust of his holy feet upon my head. I make my obeisance unto his invincible, wondrously purifying lotus feet - perpetually do I bow to the brilliance emanating from the toenails of the holy feet of my Divine Master

Prayer in Separation of Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura</li>
<li>Alas, alas! O Bhaktivinoda Thakura, O Supreme Guru, for twenty-two years this world has been plunged into misfortune, long grief-stricken in your intolerable separation. You are the divine potency of Sri Gaura, and you graciously made your advent in this earthly plane, being attracted by the living beings&rsquo; virtuous deeds performed throughout many lifetimes.</li>
<li>Since I am lowly and very wretched, it was not my luck to reach the ocean that bestows the fortune of surrender - the ocean of the ecstasy of bathing in a particle of the dust of your holy lotus feet. Yet due to your magnanimous nature, you gave your grace to the whole universe, personally revealing your supereminence as the
personification of the mercy potency of Sri Gauranga. (That is, by coming into this world, I received his grace.)</li>
<li>O Lord, even all the demigods headed by Lord Brahma feel frustrated by their inability to (fittingly) sing the glories of all your divine qualities. What, then, can be said of the attempt of a fallen soul, a mere human like me? Surely, the learned will never waste their eloquent words eulogizing this statement, since even the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Sri Krsna Himself, has sung in the Scriptures His celebrated confession Ôna paraye &lsquo;hamÕ - ÔI am unable (to reciprocate your devotion).Õ</li>
<li>At a time when religion was evaluated in terms of bodily relationship, saintliness was determined by ignorance, and yoga practice was motivated by sensual pleasure; when scholarship was cultivated just for voidism, japa was conducted for the sake of fame, and penance was performed out of vindictiveness; when charity was given out of pride, and on the pretext of spontaneous devotion the most gross, sinful acts were perpetrated - and in all such anomalous situations even the intelligentsia were at loggerheads with one another&hellip; at that very time, you were sent by the Almighty Creator.</li>
<li>As the universally cooling moon is beautified by diffusing its nectarean rays, nourishing the plants and inciting the twinkling of the stars, your Holy Advent in this world is similarly ascertained as satisfying the pure devotional Scriptures (through profound study) and blessing the learned with full-blown happiness (by the perfect axiomatic conclusions descending in Divine Succession). With your
appearance, the ecstasy of the devotees knows no bounds.</li>
<li>By writing many books and by multifarious methods recognized by the pure devotees, you have demonstrated the preaching of pure devotional service unto the Supreme Lord, for the benefit of the whole world. We have heard of similar achievements in previous times by stalwart scholars such as Sri Ramanuja and many other Acaryas; but the glory of you - the very embodiment of the nectar of divine love - does not end (cannot be confined) here.</li>
<li>Merely the effulgence of His divine abode has been designated by the title &lsquo;Brahman&rsquo; in the Vedas, and only the expansion of an expansion of His expansion is sought after with great tribulation by the foremost yogis. The most exalted of the liberated souls shine resplendent as the bumblebees at His lotus feet. The Primeval Origin of even the Original Sri Narayana who is the Lord of the spiritual sky above Brahman: He is the Original Supreme Lord, the personification of all nectarine mellows - Sri Krsna - and He is the one that you give.</li>
<li>Situated in the topmost region of the absolutely inconceivable spiritual sky is the holy abode of Sri Vrndavana Dhama, in the spiritual planet known as Goloka. There, surrounded by Sakhis, Srimati Radhika revels in the mellows of divine pastimes. With great ecstasy, She expands the joy of loving sweetness in the service of Sri Krsnacandra, who is otherwise served in four relationships up to parenthood. You, O Thakura Bhaktivinoda, can give us the service of that holy Dhama.</li>
<li>The internal purport is known to Sri Svarupa Damodara by the sanction of Sri Gauracandra, of that which is adored by Sri Sanatana Goswami and distributed by the preceptors realized in transcendental mellows, headed by Sri Rupa Goswami; that which is tasted and enhanced by Sri Raghunatha Dasa Goswami and
followers and carefully protected by the votaries headed by Sri Jiva
Prabhu; and that which (from a respectful distance) is venerated by great personalities such as Sri Suka, Lord Siva, the chief of the demigods, and Lord Brahma, the grandfather of all beings - O wonder of wonders! the nectarine rapture of servitude unto Sri Radhika - that, too, you can give us.</li>
<li>Where am I, so lowly and fallen, and where are you, the great soul who delivers the universe! O Lord, by your grace, you are sure to forgive my offenses. O ocean of mercy, in the dust of your lotus feet I pray for just this benediction: kindly make my life successful by recommending me for admission into the group of Sri Varsabhanavi Dayita Dasa, who is the dearmost one in your heart.
Translator&rsquo;s Note:
The preceding prayer to Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura (1838-1914), the pioneer of pure devotion in the recent age, was composed within the lifetime of the author&rsquo;s Guru, Srila Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Thakura Goswami Prabhupada. Upon reading the original Sanskrit verse, Srila Prabhupada commented, &ldquo;Now I am confident that we have one man who is qualified to uphold the standard of our Sampradaya (Divine Succession).&rdquo;

Homage unto Sri Srimad Gaura Kisora Babaji Maharaja</li>
<li>O Divine Master of my Divine Master, my most venerable preceptor, you are supremely worshippable in the group of the foremost associates of Sri Gauranga. May you be gracious upon this servitor surrendered unto your loving servitor (Dayita Dasa). O Gaura Kisora, again and again do I make my obeisance unto you.</li>
<li>O worshipful one, you alone revealed my Lord and Master, who is renowned throughout the universe as Sri Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati, and who is the only friend of the fallen souls of the world. O Gaura Kisora, again and again do I make my obeisance unto you.</li>
<li>Living in solitude at Vraja Dhama, your heart was absorbed in the most secret pastimes of the Divine Youthful Couple of Vraja, whilst externally you maintained the strictures of a renunciate; and sometimes you appeared to transcend all recognized strictures. O Gaura Kisora, again and again do I make my obeisance unto you.</li>
<li>Sometimes you roam about the edge of Gauravana (the boundary of Sri Navadvipa Dhama), wandering along the beach near the banks of the Ganga. O Gaura Kisora, who dons the holy loin-cloth and carries the mendicant&rsquo;s water-pot, again and again do I make my obeisance unto you.</li>
<li>Ever singing the holy name of Sri Hari with great ecstasy and accepting alms from house to house like a bee collecting honey from flower to flower, you are the great soul unto whom even the demigods bow to. O Gaura Kisora, again and again do I make my obeisance unto you.</li>
<li>Becoming overwhelmed with love for your worshipful Lord, sometimes you dance, sometimes you cry, sometimes you laugh; and again, you sing aloud. The people profusely offer their respects unto you, O Gaura Kisora, and again and again do I make my obeisance unto you.</li>
<li>O friend of the glorious Thakura Bhaktivinoda, O matchless ocean of the nectar of loving devotion for Mahaprabhu Sri Caitanyadeva, O moon that received the grace of Vaisnava Sarvabhauma Sri Jagannatha, O Gaura Kisora! again and again do I make my obeisance unto you.</li>
<li>Completing the great holy vow of Urjja-vrata, you selected the day of the awakening of Sri Damodara to achieve the cherished treasure of your internal identity as a Sakhi devoted to the service of Sri Radhika. O Gaura-Kisora, again and again do I make my obeisance unto you.</li>
<li>Forsaking the company of the residents of Kuliya town to accept the service of your servitor Sri Dayita Dasa, your divine presence is now found in a holy temple at Sri Dhama Mayapura. O Gaura Kisora, again and again do I make obeisance unto you.</li>
<li>Although I remain deep in the mud of offenses, I (a fallen soul) am begging you for your causeless mercy. Please be gracious and deliver this soul bereft. O Gaura Kisora, again and yet again do I make my obeisance unto you.

Prayer unto Sri Sri Dayita Dasa
(after the manifest pastimes of Sri Srila Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Thakura)</li>
<li>At the end of the night of Sri Sri Vrsabhanunandini, She suddenly took him to her entourage, withdrawing him from the company of throngs of grief-stricken souls. A great cry of lamentation arose, their bodies were bathed by their tears. When he was thus stolen away, this world was plunged into the deep darkness of one whose eyes have been stolen away (hrta - stolen away; nayana-mani - jewel of the eye - the internal name of Saraswati Thakura is &lsquo;Nayana- mani&rsquo;).
(Bereft of the vision of my Divine Master,) O my sorrowful eyes (dina-nayana), (or, O savior of the fallen [Dina-nayana],) wherever that great soul may be, please quickly take this servitor there! (Although he is my Master named &lsquo;Nayana,&rsquo; or &lsquo;one who brings us near,&rsquo; in his mercy he shows the miserliness of not taking me unto his company.)</li>
<li>From his lotus feet, the nectarine river of divine love flows throughout the universe; his servitors, like bees, maintain their lives drinking the honey that falls from his lotus feet; and the pure devotees in the shelter of the confidential mellows of Vraja revel in the bliss of singing the glories of his lotus feet: O Dina-nayana, wherever that great soul may be, please quickly take this servitor there.</li>
<li>Parental affection, so highly esteemed in the world, is a colossal hoax (as an obstacle to Hari-bhakti); socially recognized pure matrimonial love is nothing but dacoitry (in that it plunders away both the husband&rsquo;s and the wife&rsquo;s eagerness for the chance to acquire the treasure of love unadulterated by the superficiality of familial prejudice); and common friendship is merely deception: I have gleaned these thoughts from the rays of light that emanate from the toenails of the holy feet of that great personality, the embodiment of supramundane affection. O Dina-nayana, wherever that great soul may be, please quickly take this servitor there.</li>
<li>The divine message sung by Sri Krsna Caitanyacandra had its continuous play in the ears of the people. From the ear, did he, just to fulfill the purport of the name &lsquo;Nayana-mani,&rsquo; reveal his form to the eye, making his advent in the mansion (temple) favored by the glance of Sri Nilacalacandra (at the time of the Rathayatra festival)? O Dina-nayana, wherever that great soul (Mahapurusa) may be, please swiftly take this servitor there.</li>
<li>Drawing up the pure golden waters of the Jambu River mentioned in Srimad-Bhagavatam, has this golden cloud arisen on the mountain where the golden moon (Sri Gauracandra) descended (set), just to shower down torrents of rain upon the whole countryside that was scorched by the forest fire (of threefold sufferings), then suddenly conceal himself in the dust of the land of the Advent of Sri Gauranga? O Dina-nayana, wherever that Great Master may be now, please quickly take this servitor to that place.</li>
<li>He is of the same hue as Sri Gaura, and although he, who sings the tidings of Sri Gaura, is the (natural) Guru of the whole universe, he accepted discipleship to a great devotee called Sri Gaura Kisora (&lsquo;adolescent Gaura&rsquo;). In the whole Gaura-mandala he is the repository of the glory of those who grant entrance into the fold of the pure Gaudiya Vaisnavas. He proudly ascended the lofty throne of preaching the glories of the gift of the Golden Lord Sri Gaura (the service of Sri Radha-Govinda in Vraja) to the Vaisnavas of Dravida (the devotees in South India, who are generally worshippers of Laksmi-Narayana). The glory of his dignity shines even in the group of Sri Gandharva, and he holds a pre-eminent position in the intimate circle of Sri Giridhari, that is, he is the most beloved of Lord Mukunda. O Dina-nayana, where that great soul is now, please swiftly take this servitor there.</li>
<li>He inundated the whole universe of countless living beings - whether brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya, sudra, less than sudra, and even mleccha - with the oceanic nectar of the holy name of Sri Radha-Krsna. Although unapproachable by the liberationists and yogic perfectionists, he is known as the friend of the fallen, the mercy potency of Sri Gauranga. O Dina-nayana, wherever that great soul may be, please swiftly take this servitor there.</li>
<li>Do I have a hope to ever see that beautiful golden personality who makes everything auspicious for the world? Do I have a hope to ever behold that tall figure once again, his blue lotus eyes, his nose that excels the charm of the Tila flower, his forehead that shames the half-moon, his graceful lotus face, his gleaming pearl-white teeth, his long arms extending to his knees? O Dina-nayana, wherever that great soul has gone, please swiftly take this servitor there.</li>
<li>In the year of our Lord Gauranga 450, in the month of Pausa, on the fourth day of the dark fortnight of the moon in the star of Magha, at the closing of the night of Brhaspativara (5.30 a.m., 1st
January, 1937), that most beloved attendant of Srimati Vrsabhanunandini entered into the eternal pastimes. O Dina-
nayana, wherever that great soul may be, quickly take this servitor there to him.</li>
<li>The entire earth and skies were filled with the cries of anguish of the people, and of the disciples devoted to the service of Sri Gurudeva&rsquo;s lotus feet. Where has that Great Master gone? Alas! today the whole universe seems empty, in the separation of Prabhupada. The servitor of Gurudeva cannot endure even a moment of his separation. O Dina-nayana, wherever, wherever that great soul may be, please quickly take this servitor there to him.

Aspiring for the Dust of Srimad Rupa Goswami&rsquo;s Lotus Feet</li>
<li>Srila Rupa Goswami is the mine of the most precious treasure, the leader of the associates of Lord Caitanya (the Divine Succession being known as the Rupanuga Sampradaya, &rsquo;the followers of Sri Rupa&rsquo;). In the company of his brothers, he was resplendent in (the province of) Gauda, causing the fervent twin bumblebees in the form of the lotus eyes of Sri Caitanyadeva to drink nectar, as the Lord&rsquo;s lotus feet moved on the pretext of visiting Vrndavana. When will that Srimad Rupa Prabhu grace me with the dust of his holy feet?</li>
<li>At Sri Ramakeli Dhama, the king of bees - the heart of Sri Rupa became intoxicated drinking the honey-wine of the lotus feet of Sri Gauracandra, and sacrificed its life (in Hari-kirtana) for the benefit of all the people of the world, summarily abandoning a life of kingly opulence. After informing his elder brother Sri Sanatana, Sri Rupa and his younger brother Sri Vallabha followed the footsteps of Sri Caitanyadeva, whose heart was absorbed in going (from Nilacala) to Sri Vrndavana. When will that Sri Rupa Prabhu grace me with the dust of his holy lotus feet?</li>
<li>Sri Caitanyadeva returned from Vrndavana to Prayaga Dhama and performed Nama-sankirtana, surrounded by crowds of hundreds of thousands. Intoxicated with divine love, dancing, He melted the hearts of hundreds of faithful souls with His astonishing transcendental ecstasies. Sri Rupa, as though regaining his most precious treasure, thus found Sri Caitanyadeva in the direct presence of the Deity Sri Bindu Madhava. When will that Sri Rupa Prabhu grace me with the dust of his holy lotus feet?</li>
<li>At the sacred spot on the confluence of the Ganga and the Yamuna, Sri Rupa achieved intimate union with the lotus feet of the dearmost Lord of his life - the Lord who is Krsna within and Gaura without. In grave humility, with straw in mouth and with tears of sorrow, he along with his younger brother worshiped Sri Gaura- Krsna in intense love. When will that Sri Rupa Prabhu grace me with the dust of his holy lotus feet?</li>
<li>Sri Caitanyadeva saw Sri Rupa and his younger brother rolling on the ground some distance away. Seeing His endeared one, His favorite, His love divine personified in natural beauty and charm, His exclusive alter ego in divine pastimes, the Lord swiftly approached Sri Rupa, profusely singing his glories, and embraced him in ecstasy. When will that Sri Rupa Prabhu grace me with the dust of his holy lotus feet?</li>
<li>Sri Gaurahari knew that (as an eternal associate of the Lord) Sri Rupa was already proficient in wandering throughout the ambrosial ocean of all mellows, in the land of unalloyed love (in Vraja-rasa). Nonetheless, to expand His own pastimes, the Lord enabled him to drink the sweet ecstasy of servitude unto Sri Radha, and empowered him with the skill to distribute the nectar of His personal devotional service. When will that Srimad Rupa Prabhu grace me with the dust of his lotus feet?</li>
<li>When on the order of Sri Gauranga, Sri Rupa visited Sri Purusottama Ksetra after completing the circumambulation of Sri Vraja Mandala, He highly gratified Sri Caitanyadeva and the sagacious devotee assembly headed by Sri Svarupa Damodara and Sri Ramananda Raya by his ambrosial poetry on the pastimes of the Divine Couple of Vraja. When will that Srimad Rupa Prabhu grace me with the dust of his lotus feet?</li>
<li>When the manifest lila of the Supreme Lord Sri Caitanyadeva was withdrawn, all beings including the immobile entities were mortified,deeply afflicted in sorrow. Sri Rupa and his elder brother were the only shelter for even the intimate devotees of the Lord, headed by Raghunatha, Gopal Bhatta, and Sri Jiva, who had almost lost their lives in the Lord&rsquo;s separation. When will that Srimad Rupa Prabhu grace me with the dust of his lotus feet?</li>
<li>By writing many, many books, he gave the world all the most cherished desires of his worshipful Lord Sri Caitanyadeva, principally - revealing the service of the Deity, establishing the pure code of conduct in devotion, revealing the lost holy places, and revealing the path of spontaneous devotion (Raga-marga) in transcendental loving service to Sri Radha-Govinda. When will that Srimad Rupa Prabhu grace me with the dust of his holy lotus feet?</li>
<li>Just prior to the withdrawal of his manifest lila, my causelessly merciful Divine Master, Srila Saraswati Thakura, handed me over to the holy feet of that Divine Personality by having me sing the glorious prayer unto his lotus feet (Sri Rupa-manjari-pada). Despite my lowliness, when will - disregarding all my various qualifications and disqualifications - Srimad Rupa Prabhu grace me with the dust of his holy lotus feet?

Homage unto Sri Dayita Dasa</li>
<li>He (of divine form) came forth from the birthplace of the golden lotus - the ocean of the mellow of divine consorthood. His large, merciful eyes dispel (the suffering souls&rsquo;) fear and proclaim (the surrendered souls&rsquo;) victory. His tongue (constantly) vibrates the whole Earth planet with Sri Krsna-sankirtana, his beauty resplendent in the robes of the sun&rsquo;s radiance (saffron) that purifies the universe and dispels the suffering of material existence. On his
Holy Day of Advent, I (again and again) bow down unto that beloved associate of Sri Vrsabhanunandini, and the servitors of his lotus feet.</li>
<li>The devotees surrendered in pure devotion are eternally protected at his lotus feet. He is worshippable by the pure souls endowed with sincerity and good fortune, and he accepts (even) those who obstruct the service of Sri Hari, just to rectify them. As the very fountainhead of mercy upon all mobile and immobile beings, he crushes the inauspiciousness of the whole universe. On his Holy Day of Advent, I (again and again) bow down unto that beloved associate of Sri Vrsabhanunandini, and the servitors of his lotus feet.</li>
<li>Like a miracle, his body moves with a joyful elegance and charm beyond the world&rsquo;s understanding, fulfilling the artist&rsquo;s aspiration. (Or, dancing in pastimes transcendental to the world, his artistic form incites divine love&rsquo;s hankering). His intellect surpasses that of (even) the demigods, and he is nobility incarnate as the commander in-chief of the Vaisnava sannyasis (tridandi-yatis). The sadhus of profound intellect describe the nature of his personality as meticulously in the line of Sri Sanatana, Sri Rupa, and Sri Raghunatha, and they speak of him as being on the same plane as Sri Jivapada (being superbly replete in perfect theistic conclusions). On his Holy Day of Advent, I (again and again) bow down unto that beloved associate of Sri Vrsabhanunandini, and the servitors of his lotus feet.</li>
<li>On the bank of Sri Radha Kunda at Svananda Sukhada Kunja, he is devoted to the service of his Beloved, and (furthermore) he is greatly endeared to the divine damsels of Vraja headed by Lalita. He is most favorite to Kamala-manjari who is pre-eminent in Vrndavana, and with the glorious qualities of Gunamanjari he builds the residence of Sri Hari. On his Holy Day of Advent, I (again and again) bow down unto that beloved associate of Sri
Vrsabhanunandini, and the servitors of his lotus feet.</li>
<li>He is immaculate joy incarnate, or, he is the graciousness or the joy of Vimala Devi. He manifested the pastimes of his Advent at Purusottama Ksetra in the holy land of Orissa, and he revealed his pastimes of delivering the fallen souls and extending his mercy upon them (by awarding them the gift of divine love) at the &rsquo;new isles,&rsquo; or Navadvipa. Circumambulating Gaura Dhama in the same way as traditionally done at Vraja Dhama and Purusottama Dhama, he continuously propagates - the loving desire of Vraja, the divine abode of Vaikuntha, and the holy name of Krsna. On his Day of Holy Advent, I (again and again) make my obeisance unto that dear associate of Sri Vrsabhanunandini, and the servitors of his holy lotus feet.</li>
