  <meta property="og:description" content="Śrila Jiva Gosvāmī ŚRĪ PARAMĀTMA SANDARBHA The Living Being, Its Bondage, and the Immanent Absolute Translation &amp; Commentary SATYANARAYANA DASA Paramätma Sandarbha THIS IS THE THIRD BOOK in the series of six treatises called Sat Sandarbhas or Bhagavata Sandarbha. It is an elaborate essay on the nature of Paramātmā. The distinction between Absolute Reality’s manifestations as Paramātmā and Bhagavan is relatively unknown, even to specialists in the field of Vedänta. These two specific designations are often used synonymously to refer to a single aspect of the tattva. It was Śri Jiva Gosvāmi’s genius to clearly define them and enumerate their characteris- tics and functions in detail. There is no other work in the entire gamut of Indian theological and philosophical literature that throws light on this subject so lucidly. Paramātmā, also called Puruşa, is akin to what people usually conceive of as God, the creator and overseer of the cosmos, whereas Bhagavan is God in His supreme transcendence, without reference to the phenomenal world - God in His own intrinsic being. Paramātmā is the regulator of the intermedia- ry potency (taṭastha-sakti) and the extrinsic potency (bahiranga-sakti), otherwise known as māyā. He is never influenced by this extrinsic potency, even while present in the midst of it. Satyanarayana Dasa BORN IN 1954, he was drawn to the spiritual traditions of his home country India since his childhood. After receiving a postgraduate degree in 1978 from IIT Delhi, he then worked in the United States for four years. After this period, he returned to India to begin formal study of the orthodox systems of Indian philosophy known as şad-darśana under the direct guidance of his guru Śrī Haridāsa Śāstrī Mahārāja and Svāmī Śyäma Sarana Mahārāja. This education was pursued in the traditional manner for more than 25 years as he dedicated himself to the practice of bhakti-yoga. In 1991 he accepted the traditional Vaisnava order of renounced life, bābāji-veṣa. His main focus has been on the works of Jiva Gosvāmi, particularly the Sat Sandarbhas, providing English translation and commentary. He also earned four sastric degrees, and received both a law degree and a PhD in Sanskrit from Agra University. Satyanarayana Dasa is the director of the Jiva Institute of Vaishnava Studies in Vrindavan, India. In 2013 he was honored by the president of India, Pranab Mukherjee, for his extraordi- nary contribution in presenting Vedic culture and philosophy to students and audiences within India and internationally.

PARAMĀTMA
SANDARBHA
The Living Being, Its Bondage, and the Immanent Absolute
Translation &amp; Commentary
SATYANARAYANA DASA
Paramätma Sandarbha
THIS IS THE THIRD BOOK in the series of six treatises called Sat Sandarbhas or Bhagavata Sandarbha. It is an elaborate essay on the nature of Paramātmā. The distinction between Absolute Reality&rsquo;s manifestations as Paramātmā and Bhagavan is relatively unknown, even to specialists in the field of Vedänta. These two specific designations are often used synonymously to refer to a single aspect of the tattva. It was Śri Jiva Gosvāmi&rsquo;s genius to clearly define them and enumerate their characteris- tics and functions in detail. There is no other work in the entire gamut of Indian theological and philosophical literature that throws light on this subject so lucidly.
Paramātmā, also called Puruşa, is akin to what people usually conceive of as God, the creator and overseer of the cosmos, whereas Bhagavan is God in His supreme transcendence, without reference to the phenomenal world - God in His own intrinsic being. Paramātmā is the regulator of the intermedia- ry potency (taṭastha-sakti) and the extrinsic potency (bahiranga-sakti), otherwise known as māyā. He is never influenced by this extrinsic potency, even while present in the midst of it.
Satyanarayana Dasa
BORN IN 1954, he was drawn to the spiritual traditions of his home country India since his childhood. After receiving a postgraduate degree in 1978 from IIT Delhi, he then worked in the United States for four years. After this period, he returned to India to begin formal study of the orthodox systems of Indian philosophy known as şad-darśana under the direct guidance of his guru Śrī Haridāsa Śāstrī Mahārāja and Svāmī Śyäma Sarana Mahārāja. This education was pursued in the traditional manner for more than 25 years as he dedicated himself to the practice of bhakti-yoga. In 1991 he accepted the traditional Vaisnava order of renounced life, bābāji-veṣa. His main focus has been on the works of Jiva Gosvāmi, particularly the Sat Sandarbhas, providing English translation and
commentary. He also earned four sastric degrees, and received both a law degree and a PhD in Sanskrit from Agra University. Satyanarayana Dasa is the director of the Jiva Institute of Vaishnava Studies in Vrindavan, India. In 2013 he was honored by the president of India, Pranab Mukherjee, for his extraordi- nary contribution in presenting Vedic culture and philosophy to students and audiences within India and internationally.

We bow down to Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī Prabhupada who revealed the essential meaning of Srimad Bhagavatam to the people of the world just as plainly as one would display an amalaki fruit kept on one&rsquo;s palm.
sandarbha yena nadhītās tasya bhagavate śramaḥ sandarbha yena cadhītā nāsti bhāgavate bhramaḥ
One who has not undergone comprehensive study of Sat Sandarbhas must struggle to assimilate the message of Srimad Bhagavatam. One who has studied Sat Sandarbhas, however, will have no misgivings about the essential meaning of Śrimad Bhāgavatam.

PARAMATMA SANDARBHA is the third book in the series of six trea- tises called Sat Sandarbhas or Bhagavata Sandarbha. In the first of these, Tattva Sandarbha, Śrī Jiva Gosvāmi begins his exposi- tion with a discussion of epistemology, establishing Śrīmad Bhāga- vata Purana as the most authoritative means of valid knowing (pramāna) in the matter of the self-disclosure of Absolute Real- ity. Having done so, he proceeds to examine the contents of the book to determine the knowable (jñeya). Taking up the topic of ontology (prameya), he inquires into the nature of the signified Reality (sambandhi-tattva), the means of Its immediate realization (abhidheya), and the end to be achieved in regard to that Reality (prayojana). To do so, he analyzes the samadhi of Śrīla Vyasadeva, which contains the gist of the essential teachings of Srimad Bhaga- vata Purana. In the state of supracognitive absorption (samādhi), Absolute Reality was self-disclosed to Vyasa as Bhagavan Śrī Kṛṣṇa, replete with varieties of energies.
Vyasa directly witnessed that among the potencies belonging to the Supreme Personal Absolute, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, His extrinsic energy, māyā, was situated apart from Him, while yet entirely supported by Him (tad-apaśraya). Vyasa also saw the individual living beings, the jivas, as conscious integrated parts of the Complete Whole, Bhagavan.Although the jivas are beyond the insentient gunas of māyā, they become identified with those gunas due to māya&rsquo;s influence and are thus subjected to the miseries of phenomenal existence. It was further disclosed to Vyasa that the yoga of unal- loyed devotion (bhakti) to Bhagavan Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the direct means

Introduction
of transcending such material identification, establishing the pure self in its intrinsic identity and relation with its conscious source.
This is the core teaching of Bhagavata Purana and also of the Sat Sandarbhas, which represent an analysis of the essential topics of Bhāgavata Purana. In particular, Śrī Jīva cites verse 1.1.2 of the Bhagavatam to outline its primary subject - that is, knowledge of the Supreme Immutable Reality (vastava-vastu). The nature of this Reality is specified further in the seminal vadanti verse (SB 1.2.11) from which Tattva Sandarbha as well as the following two Sanda- rbhas, Bhagavat and Paramātma, derive their names. This Real- ity, or tattva, is nondual consciousness (jñānam advayam) and is referred to as Brahman, Paramātmā, and Bhagavan. Śrī Jīva Gosvāmī expands on this verse in the concluding portion of Tattva Sandarbha and the two Sandarbhas that follow. label a dtiw nolt
In the second book, Bhagavat Sandarbha, Śrī Jiva Gosvāmī demonstrates that Bhagavan, the transcendent Absolute replete with personhood, qualities, form, and action, is the most complete manifestation of the Absolute Reality, while Paramātmā and Brah- man are but partial manifestations of that same truth. Reality is one only, but it manifests primarily in three aspects to three different types of spiritual seekers as the qualified Absolute, Bhagavan, to the devotional transcendentalists, as the Immanent Self, Paramātmā, to the yogis, and as the unqualified Absolute, Brahman, to the jñānis. From this perspective, Brahman realiza- tion amounts to nothing other than the immediate intuition of the Absolute known as Bhagavan, yet divested of His intrinsic quali- ties, potencies, and form. Paramātmā is a partial manifestation of Bhagavan who animates prakṛti for the evolution and regulation of the cosmos. Realization of Bhagavan naturally includes awareness of the other two, and thus Bhagavan is considered to be the most complete manifestation of Absolute Reality (tattva). vi, adr
Bhagavan is the Complete Person (puruşam pūrṇam), who has His own eternal abode and liberated associates in the spiritual realm. He has real potencies inherent within His nature, all of which can be divided into three categories - intrinsic (antara- nga), intermediary (taṭastha), and extrinsic (bahiranga). This

Introduction
classification of the potencies of Bhagavan is based upon two verses from Vişņu Purāna (6.7.61-62). Śrī Jīva Gosvāmi&rsquo;s unique contribu- tion to Vedanta philosophy was to make this distinction explicit, which is a significant aid in understanding Bhagavan, the con- scious living beings, the manifested cosmos, and the interrelation between them. This refinement in understanding is not commonly brought to light by Indian theists, who tend to conflate Bhagavan and Paramātmā without differentiation.
Bhagavan&rsquo;s intrinsic potency manifests directly as His body, qualities, abode, associates, and activities. The limitless conscious living beings, both in the material as well as the transempirical realms, are manifestations of the intermediary potency - so called because they mediate between the intrinsic and extrinsic poten- cies. The phenomenal worlds, on the other hand, are manifesta- tions of Bhagavan&rsquo;s extrinsic potency. Although Reality (tattva) is one only, it encompasses all three of the above-mentioned manifes- tations; they are not just theoretical concepts but ontological reali- ties. Bhagavan is ever-present in His own abode and is engaged in His divine play with His devotees. He does not directly participate in the affairs of the phenomenal world. It is for this reason that Bhagavan expands as Paramātmā - also called Puruşa or Isvara for the evolution, sustenance, and dissolution of the phenomenal world. to bns slows e5

Paramātma Sandarbha is an elaborate essay on the nature of Paramātmā. The distinction between Absolute Reality&rsquo;s manifesta- tions as Paramātmā and Bhagavan is relatively unknown, even to those who study Vedanta. These two specific designations are often used synonymously to refer to a single aspect of the tattva. It was Śrī Jiva Gosvāmi&rsquo;s genius to clearly define them and enumerate their characteristics and functions in detail. There is no other work in the entire gamut of Indian theological and philosophical literature that throws light on this subject so lucidly. Śrī Jiva Gosvāmi&rsquo;s approach is very simple and unique. Taking his cue from the vadanti verse (SB 1.2.11), he comments extensively on the three appellations of the tattva - Brahman, Paramātmā, and Bhagavan.canashi

Introduction
Paramātmā is akin to what people usually conceive of as God, the creator and overseer of the cosmos, whereas Bhagavan is God in His supreme transcendence, without reference to the phenome- nal world - God in His own intrinsic being. Paramātmā is the reg- ulator of the intermediary potency (taṭastha-śakti) and the extrin- sic potency (bahiranga-sakti), otherwise known as māyā. He is, thus, qualified (visista) by these two potencies. The conditioned living being, jiva, belongs to the former potency, while the latter is responsible for the evolution, sustenance, and dissolution of the cosmos. These two potencies are distinct from the intrinsic potency of Bhagavan, known as the antaranga or svarupa-sakti, and are to be understood as being directly under the jurisdiction of Paramātmā, not Bhagavan.

A Bird&rsquo;s Eye-View of Paramatma Sandarbha
In the radical nondualistic Vedanta of Sri Sankarācārya, the ātmā is equated with Brahman, relying solely on one-sided Upanisadic statements such as tat tvam asi, &ldquo;You are that,&rdquo; and aham brahma- smi, &ldquo;I am Brahman.&rdquo; Śrī Jīva argues that such statements refer, rather, to the identity of consciousness between the self and Brahman and not to absolute identity. Taking a broader view that encompasses the Upanisads as a whole and not merely the identity statements, Śrī Jīva advocates the position of distinction within unity (bheda-abheda). This understanding is the key to ascertain the self&rsquo;s true identity in relation to the complete whole. To this end, he begins Paramätma Sandarbha by making evident the distinction between the individual self (ātmā) and the Sup- reme Immanent Self (Paramātmā). Thus, the first section of the book delineates the ontology of Paramātmā as the supreme wit- ness (kṣetrajña), the animator of primordial nature (Purușa), and the regulator of the jivas and the gunas of prakṛti.di) sambill bin Since the entire analysis of God&rsquo;s potencies is intended solely for the benefit of rational beings, Śrī Jiva next turns his attention to an exposition of jiva-sakti.

Introduction
falsely constructed phenomenal self. In this section, therefore, Śrī Jiva lays bare the intrinsic characteristics of the ātmā as a conscious integrated part of Paramātmā, distinct from prakṛti.
TheThis picture would not be complete without a transparent view of māyā, since the extrinsic energy is what binds the jiva, inducing in us the artificial sense of separation from God. Consequently, the third topic taken up by Śrī Jiva Gosvāmi is the nature and function- ing of māyā. This leads to a discussion of the evolution of the cos- mos, which is a product of maya. Since the jiva is part of the cosmos through participation in it, it is important for him to understand its nature and how to interact with it so as to transform it. To gain permanent release from a disease, it is necessary to know its cause. Similarly, to be freed from the false identification with māyā, it is imperative to trace out its cause and the process to attain release from it. Additionally, Śrī Jiva elucidates the true intention behind Paramātmā&rsquo;s creative act and accounts for His apparent indiffer- ence to the suffering of the living beings in conditional existence. He completes the book with an investigation into the prime sub- ject of discussion in Srimad Bhagavatam, conclusively demonstrat- ing that it is none other than Śri Bhagavan. In this way, Paramātmā Sandarbha can be divided into four parts. A brief summary of these is provided below.

The first part, comprising the first eighteen anucchedas, involves a deliberation on the essential nature and functions of Param- ātmā. Being the source and shelter of the jiva, or taṭastha-sakti, Paramātmā is the interior regulator of all living beings. He is, thus, known as the supreme witness (kṣetrajña) of the fields of action. The word kṣetra (lit., &ldquo;a field&rdquo;) refers to the body and the cosmos, and thus kṣetrajña means &ldquo;one who knows the presentational field of the body and the environment in which it participates.&rdquo;

Introduction
To establish Paramātmā as kṣetrajña, Śrī Jīva Gosvāmi begins his analysis by citing two verses from Bhāgavata Purāņa spoken by Jaḍa Bharata to King Rahugaṇa (SB 5.11.12-13). Although Jada Bharata uses the term kṣetrajña for both the individual self as well as Param- ātmā, Śrī Jīva argues that in its primary sense the word applies to Paramātmā alone. He refers to Bhagavad Gita (13.1-2) to support his argument. The jiva knows only his own individual body, whereas Paramātmā is the knower of all bodies whatsoever, gross as well as subtle. Paramātmā is the inner regulator of these two types of bodies and yet is not influenced by them. Although the jiva is also a limited knower (kṣetrajña) of the individuated field of his own body, his knowing capacity is not independent of Paramātmā, because he is but a part of His taṭastha-sakti. Paramātmā is thus the primary referent of the word kṣetrajña. This is to say that the living beings depend upon Paramātmā even to gain knowledge about their gross and subtle bodies. This implies that without His grace, they cannot attain freedom from the conditioning caused by these two types of bodies.
According to Śri Jiva Gosvāmi, there are three manifestations of Paramātmā - the metacosmic, the macrocosmic, and the micro- cosmic. The first manifestation, Karaṇodakaśāyī Viṣņu, is the inner regulator of the metacosm, meaning the totality of all jivas and prakṛti. He is the one who glances at the unmanifest primor- dial nature at the onset of a new creative cycle, impregnating it with the jivas along with their past karma. He manifests unlimited universes from the pores of His body. The second manifestation, Garbhodakaśāyi Vişņu, is the inner regulator of the macrocosm, who expands into as many forms as there are universes. He thus enters into each one of them as witness and support. The third manifestation, Kṣirodakaśāyī Viṣṇu, is the inner regulator of the microcosm, or the individual jivas. These three manifestations of Paramātmā are also known as Sankarṣaṇa, Pradyumna, and Ani- ruddha, respectively, who along with Vasudeva are called catur- vyuha. In Kṛṣṇa Sandarbha it will be explained that Bhagavan has innumerable forms. Śrī Kṛṣṇa, however, is the original form of Bhagavan, and Vasudeva is His expansion.ona

Introduction
Paramātmā, also called Puruşa, can be further categorized in two ways, namely, as self-endowed with differentiated portions (vibhinnäṁśa), called jivas, and as endowed with plenary expan- sions (svāṁśa), called avataras. An avatara has divine powers and the intrinsic self-identity of being God. He is never influenced by the extrinsic potency, even while present in the midst of it. The jivas, however, being limited in their power, can easily fall prey to the extrinsic potency, whose influence induces in them a sense of separation from Paramātmā.
Avatāras are primarily of two types, guṇāvatāras and līlāvată- ras. The lilāvatāras will be explained in Krsna Sandarbha, which is next in the series of Six Sandarbhas. Guṇāvatāras, as the name sug- gests, are the regulators of the three gunas of prakṛti, namely, sattva, rajas, and tamas. These gunas are governed respectively by Visņu, Brahma, and Śiva, also popularly known as the &ldquo;Hindu Trinity.&rdquo; They are in charge of the acts of sustenance, creation, and dissolu- tion of the cosmos, respectively. They carry out these functions by regulating the gunas of sattva, rajas, and tamas. Śrī Jiva Gosvāmi, on the authority of Bhagavata Purana, shows that Visņu is sup- reme among these guṇāvatāras, the other two being subservient to Him. It is only Visņu who can release a conditioned being from the bondage of māyā. Śrī Jiva also explains incidentally that the scrip- tures can be classified according to the three gunas and that only the sättvika scriptures can bestow ultimate welfare to humanity.
The Ontology of the Jiva
After completing the deliberation on Paramātmā and His various manifestations, Śrī Jiva Gosvāmī turns his attention to the jiva in Anucchedas 19-47. He begins with a detailed analysis of the intrin- sic characteristics of the pure self, the ātmā, who is under the juris- diction of Paramātmā. For this, he builds upon the description of the jiva given by Jāmātṛ Muni, a teacher in the line of Śrī Rāmā- nujācārya. In the course of his discussion, he specifically refutes the concept of ātmā entertained by the radical nondualists, the Advaitavada School of Śrī Sankaracaya. He shows that their view,
xxvii
Introduction
summed up as absolute idealism, is not supported by Bhāgavata Purana or the Vedas. Rather, the true Vedantic position is that of inconceivable oneness within distinction (acintya-bheda-abheda). This understanding is essential to the path of bhakti-yoga, the pre- scribed method in Bhagavata Purana, which will be described in Bhakti Sandarbha, the fifth book in the series.
The Ontology of Māyā
The jivas in the material world are conditioned by the extrinsic potency of Paramātmā. Consequently, after enumerating the inherent qualities of the jiva in the previous section, Śrī Jīva delineates the extrinsic potency (bahiranga-śakti), called māyā, in Anucchedas 48-55. Māyā is a real potency of Paramātmā and not a mere illusion, as propounded by the Advaitavada School. It is through the agency of maya that Paramātmā conducts the functions of creation, sustenance, and dissolution. Māyā has two divisions, the instrumental or efficient aspect (nimitta), known as jīva-māyā, and the constituent or material aspect (upādāna), known as guṇa-māyā. By its inscrutable power (acintya-sakti), the jīva-māyā obscures the self-awareness of the jiva - a state that is without beginning. The guṇa-māyā, on the other hand, manifests the world in all its multiplicity through endless intermixture of the three gunas. With its two divisions, māyā operates like a modern- day manufacturing company that uses the media to advertise its products, generating desire in the minds of consumers, and then makes those products available in the market.
Jiva-māyā has two further divisions, avidya (ignorance) and vidya (wisdom). The former is the cause of bondage, while the lat- ter is the doorway to release from that same bondage. Bondage and release are not part of the jiva&rsquo;s intrinsic nature. By its very own inner constitution, the jiva is ever-liberated, but being devoid of awareness of its own true nature due to the influence of jiva-māyā, it remains shackled. The avidya part has two functions, the potency of concealment (avaraṇa-śakti) and the potency of projection or dis- tortion (vikṣepa-sakti). Through its power of concealment, avidya
xxviiiIntroduction
obscures the true nature (svarupa) of the jiva, and through its power of projection, it casts the jiva into delusion by inducing it to identify with the gross and subtle bodies. In contrast, the vidya aspect of jīva-māyā removes the jiva&rsquo;s ignorance about its intrinsic nature and thus leads to liberation. Śrī Jīva Gosvāmī makes it clear, though, that the vidya potency of jiva-maya is only the doorway to the genuine vidya potency, which, being part of Paramatma&rsquo;s intrinsic potency (svarupa-śakti), is fully transcendental in nature. The former cannot grant liberation by itself. This implies that lib- eration from the bondage of māyā is not possible without taking shelter of Paramātmā.
Hoq) not tibom s at
Jiva-māyā is called the efficient cause (nimitta), because it is instrumental in generating the cosmos as well as in grant- ing material bodies to the jivas. It has four constituents - time (kāla), destiny (daiva), karma, and innate disposition (svabhava)? Time precipitates an imbalance in the gunas of prakṛti, which then evolves into twenty-four ontological categories of being (tattvas), beginning with cosmic intellect (mahat) and culminating in earth (pṛthvi). All modifications occur within time. Karma is the efficient cause of the modifications. It is because of the force of karma that time acts on matter, modifying it in order to mete out the results of past actions performed by the jiva under the influence of māyā. Out of the total aggregate of past karma, that portion which is ready to fructify in the present life is called destiny, or daiva. Innate disposi- tion (svabhava) refers to the subconscious impressions (samskāras) left by past actions on the citta (the heart or unconscious mind). It is through the influence of such unconscious patterning that the jiva is impelled to act at present in a corresponding manner.
The constituent aspect of māyā, known as upādāna or guna- māyā, is the material cause of creation. It consists of the five subtle elements (dravya), the presentational field (kṣetra), mean- ing the unmanifest primordial nature (prakṛti), the vital force (prāna), the empirical self (ātmā), here referring to the phenome- nal ego (ahankara), the eleven senses, and the five gross elements

(vikära)? All these combined together constitute the various bodies and objects in the material world. Modifications in prakṛti occur through the influence of Paramātmā. det he
ebid
Within the same discussion of the ontology of maya, an impor- tant subdivision (Anucchedas 56-81) is devoted to the cosmos, which is a manifestation of the extrinsic potency. The relation of the cos- mos with Paramātmā is elucidated in this subsection. Śrī Jīva Gosvāmi vehemently refutes the theory propagated by the radical nondualists that the cosmos is a mere illusory appearance (vivarta- vāda). On the authority of Bhagavata Purana, he argues that the cosmos is a modification (pariņāma) of the extrinsic potency (bahiranga-sakti) of Paramātmā and not a mere appearance (viva- rta). The cosmos is a real effect of the real potency of Paramātmā, who is the Supreme Real.
According to vivarta-vāda, however, it is Brahman who appears as the cosmos through the agency of maya, just as a rope appears as a snake in semi-darkness. Hence, in the opinion of the Advai- tavādīs, the cosmos is not real, just as the snake misperceived in the rope is not real. At the same time, the cosmos cannot be deter- mined as altogether unreal or non-existent, like the horns of a rab- bit, because it can be perceived. An unreal object cannot be per- ceived at all. They conclude, therefore, that the cosmos is like a rope mistaken for a snake, which, in spite of its illusory status, can still produce the real effect of fear in the mind of a person who sees it. Thus, vivarta-vāda attributes only empirical reality (vyavahārika- satta) to the world but not ontological reality (päramärthika-sattā). For them, Brahman is the one and only reality in the absolute sense.
Śrī Jiva does not consent to this view. He reasons that the world is not unreal (mithya), because it is nondistinct from its real source, Paramātmā. So, it is real but dissoluble, like a clay pot. It is, never- theless, ever existent in the sense that it merely undergoes cycles of manifestation and non-manifestation in the form of creation and dissolution. Even during the state of dissolution, it exists still in unmanifest form, enfolded within Paramātmā. The cosmos is thus
3 See ibid.
XXX
Introduction
a modification (pariņāma) of just one of the potencies of Param- ātmā, called bahiranga. He Himself remains unchanged by the modification of His energy. Śrī Jiva offers the traditional example of a philosopher&rsquo;s stone (cintamani) that is supposed to transform iron into gold by its mere contact while at the same time remain- ing unmodified. Similarly, by His inscrutable power, Paramātmā remains immutable while impelling His māyā-sakti to manifest the cosmos. Being a potency of Paramātmā, the cosmos is nondiffer- ent from Him, by the principle that potency is nondistinct from its potent source.
All theistic schools of Vedanta accept the theory of modifica- tion, pariņāma-väda, to explain the evolution of the cosmos. The one problem they all must face as a consequence of this theory is in how to account for the immutability of Paramātmā. In partic- ular, Paramātmā is posited not only as the instrumental cause of the cosmos, but also as its material, or constituent, cause (upādāna- kāraṇa). This would seem to negate His immutability, because in our experience, a material cause always undergoes change to manifest a product, just as clay is modified in producing a pot.
Śrī Jiva solves this riddle by pointing out that the part that undergoes modification, māyā, is extrinsic to Paramātmā&rsquo;s essen- tial nature. At the same time, māyā is not different from Him, being His potency. It is for this reason that Śri Jiva postulates his the- ory known as acintya-bheda-abheda-väda, &ldquo;the transrational coex- istence of distinction within the indivisible nondual Whole.&rdquo; In Bhagavat Sandarbha (Anuccheda 15), it was established that Bhaga- vän has transrational (acintya) powers by which He can accomplish actions that defy conventional logic.
Another important subtopic under the heading of the extrin- sic potency is that of maya&rsquo;s relation to the jiva and Paramātmā (Anucchedas 82-104). Central to this discussion is the topic of the jiva&rsquo;s bondage and release from māyā. Śrī Jīva Gosvāmī refers to a query raised by Vidura to sage Maitreya about how the bondage of the jiva can be possible at all, when the latter is superior to
xxxi
Introduction
Paramätma&rsquo;s extrinsic potency. The sage replies that by the tran- srational power of Maya, a jīva becomes infatuated with her cre- ation. This bondage, however, is not real but only apparent, like the apparent shimmering of the moon when reflected on the sur- face of a lake, caused by the displacement of water. The jiva&rsquo;s illu- sory bondage is without beginning but can come to an end when authentic self-knowledge dawns by the grace of Bhagavan through self-surrender.
In this context, Śrī Jīva Gosvāmi discusses the intent behind the creative act. He frames the discussion by first raising an objection to Bhagavan&rsquo;s being the agent of creation. Because Bhagavan is fully satisfied in Himself (ātmārāma), what could possibly impel Him to create in the first place? No one acts without a purpose. Since Bhagavan has no purpose to fulfill, there is no reason for Him to take the trouble of creating the cosmos. Śrī Jiva offers a uniquely insightful reply by which he lays the ground for the Bhakti and Priti Sandarbhas. He reasons that although Bhagavan is fully self- satisfied, He is subordinate to the love of His devotees and thus acts exclusively for their sake. It would be a defect on His part if He did not reciprocate His devotees&rsquo; love. As such, He brings forth the cosmos simply out of love for those devotees who could not attain completion in the previous creative cycle and who are lying dor- mant within Paramātmā. The true intent behind creation is simply to provide such devotees a new opportunity to complete the course of their devotion. Although a person generally performs an action to bring about a particular effect, love expresses itself without any such motive. Thus, the act of creation does not render Paramātmā deficient in any way.
Han
Śrī Jiva then raises another pertinent question in regard to the topic of creation: If Bhagavan is omnipotent, why does He not remove the sufferings of humanity? To answer this question, our author first examines the psychology of compassion, pointing out that a person can feel empathy toward another and be moved to redress their suffering only if the heart is in direct contact with that other person&rsquo;s pain. Since Bhagavan is never in contact with
xxxii
Introduction
material misery in any form, He never undergoes the transfor- mation of heart that characterizes what we normally define as compassion. On the contrary, were He subject to a transformation of being associated with material pain, it would contravene His ontological status as the Supreme Transcendent. Material misery cannot influence Bhagavan any more than darkness can touch the
sun.
shy This, however, does not mean that Bhagavan is altogether unaware of material suffering. He is conscious of such suffering, but not on an immediate feeling level, which would then become an impediment to the play of His divine lilă. His affect, being entirely transcendent in nature, is involved only with His own intrinsic potency wherein material misery cannot stand. Śrī Jīva clarifies this point with an example: Where there is light there can be no darkness, and so, if darkness were treated as an actual entity and not merely as the absence of light, it could be said that darkness is the one place where light cannot abide, because it vanishes as soon as light is present. But just as the all-pervasiveness of the sun&rsquo;s light is in no way undermined by the fact that it cannot abide in darkness, so too Bhagavan&rsquo;s omniscience is not marred by the fact that He is devoid of the experience of material misery. Rather, Bhagavan is directly involved only with His own devotees, since it is they alone who desire such relation, their consciousness being entirely turned toward Him in exclusive love. To such devotees, He grants His intrinsic potency of bhakti. He and His devotees both relish supreme delight under the influence of this potency, acting for the sole purpose of increasing each other&rsquo;s intrinsic joy.
From this, it is certainly not to be concluded that Bhagavan is devoid of the capacity for mercy. The whole discussion is simply to demonstrate His utter transcendence in regard to the workings of His extrinsic potency. Bhagavan&rsquo;s compassion is, however, often praised as one of His most excellent qualities. Indeed, His grace is built into the very fabric of creation as the ever present invita- tion, immediately available through Paramātmā, to turn our atten- tion toward Him. Moreover, Bhagavan&rsquo;s devotees who are present within the world are in direct contact with the pain of humanity.
xxxiii
Introduction
As such, their hearts are directly moved to alleviate the source of such pain, which is ignorance of the self&rsquo;s true identity. Thus, the grace of Bhagavan descends to people in general through the agency of His devotees.
Additionally, Bhagavan&rsquo;s grace extends not only to the virtuous, but even to those who oppose His devotees. His punishment of such miscreants is another form of His mercy, because, by so doing, He awards them liberation, either gradual or immediate. An example of this is seen in the case of Hiranyakasipu, who terrorized his own son Prahlada, a great devotee. Bhagavan appeared as Narasimha and killed Hiranyakasipu, who was liberated after two subsequent births. Bhagavan&rsquo;s punishment, therefore, is equally a blessing, because all of His acts whatsoever are meant exclusively for the welfare of those who come in contact with Him, in whichever man- ner or attitude. Superficially, it may appear that He favors only the devas or the devotees and not those who stand in opposition to them (the asuras). Śrī Jīva Gosvāmi endeavors to show that Bhagavan is not biased although appearing to be so to the ignorant.
Determination of the Subject of Bhagavata Purāṇa
1790
In the final six anucchedas (105-110), Śrī Jīva demonstrates that the subject of Srimad Bhagavata Purana is Bhagavan. To do so, he employs the hermeneutical method of textual analysis consisting of six indicators, or sad-linga, commonly used by the followers of Vedanta to determine the primary subject of a text. The reason for this determination is twofold. Firstly, Śrī Jiva intends to establish Bhagavan, not Brahman or Paramātmā, as the highest manifesta- tion of tattva. Thus, jñāna-yoga, which leads to identity in Brah- man, is not the ultimate recommendation of Bhagavata Purāṇa, as entertained by radical nondualists. Śrī Jīva points out that the conclusion that Bhagavan is the basis of Brahman and Paramātmā concurs with that of other scriptures, such as Bhagavad Gitā. Sec- ondly, by this verdict, he lays the foundation for the next Sanda- rbha, namely, Kṛṣṇa Sandarbha, because this conclusion naturally leads to an investigation into the identity of Bhagavan.nidi
χχχίν
Introduction
Of the six criteria, Śri Jiva lays special emphasis on the first, the concurrence of the opening and closing statements. In his analy- sis, he correlates the first verse of the Bhagavatam to the first five sutras of the Brahma-sutra, to Gayatri, and to the ten primary top- ics of Srimad Bhagavatam. The closing statement is shown to spec- ify the Absolute, referred to in the opening statement in generic terms only as satyam param, to be none other than Svayam Bha- gavān, Śrī Kṛṣṇa.

Out of the Six Sandarbhas, the first four deal with the subject of our relation (sambandha) with the Supreme Person, Bhagavan; the fifth describes the means (abhidheya) of becoming permanently and immediately established in that relation; and the sixth explains the completion stage (prayojana) of such relation. The Sandarbhas are like a GPS system that informs us about our present location (sambandha), the route to be followed (abhidheya), and the ultimate destination (prayojana). Among the four Sandarbhas that delineate the knowledge of sambandha, Paramätma Sandarbha is the most important because it analyzes the nature of the self and its con- ditioning by māyā. We have to begin where we stand at present. Without this knowledge, we cannot know in which direction to move, even if we are clear about the destination.lo galzeitwa
Some spiritualists are of the opinion that it is enough to know the process and goal. This situation can be compared to a per- son lost in a forest, who knows his destination but does not know which direction to take. Without knowing our present condition, we cannot become clear about the process. For this reason, Śrī Jīva Gosvāmi has explained sambandha in the first four Sandarbhas, the present volume being the third in this series. Thus, Paramātma Sandarbha is crucial to imbibe the knowledge of sambandha, and

every serious practitioner should study it carefully. The truths con- tained in this book can uproot many of the common misconcep- tions that may be lurking in our minds, sometimes even without our being aware of them. Among these misconceptions, the most troublesome are those that are akin to radical nondualism. Even Vaisnavas on the path of bhakti can be subject to such pitfalls.
In conclusion, we provide here a list of the essential points discussed in this volume:asbuiind si
bo1. The difference between the Paramātmā and Bhagavan manifesta-
tions of tattva.
2. The three primary manifestations of Paramātmā and their bet functions.

Paramātma Sandarbha is the most philosophical of the Six Sanda- rbhas, and it demands focused attention and an unbiased attitude on the part of the reader. Anyone who is willing to take up this challenge will reap rich benefits from Śrī Jiva&rsquo;s profound knowl- edge and unique insight into the above subjects. From my lifetime of study of the systems of Indian philosophy, I am unaware of any

I bow down at the holy feet of my Gurudeva. He taught me with great love most of the works of Śrī Rūpa, Sanatana and Jīva Gosvāmi, and other Gauḍīya ācāryas. The Sat Sandarbhas were the first works I studied under him. He was a great admirer of the Gosvāmis, not only through words but by being a strict adherent of their teachings. He was a living example of Gauḍīya Vaisnava the- ology and philosophy. Thus, I learned from him not only during his discourses, but also through being with him, seeing him deal with various life situations, and serving in the gośālā and elsewhere. It is he who inspired me to propagate this knowledge by making it available in English.

only two verses, the first having the same significance as the third and fourth verses of the mangalacarana of Tattva Sandarbha, and the second being the fifth verse verbatim. Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmi did not compose a new mangalacarana at the beginning of Paramatma Sandarbha because he considered the Sat Sandarbhas to form a single book.
BUSTSOBISOM
In the first of these two verses, he again remembers the lotus feet of his teachers, Śrīla Rūpa and Sanatana Gosvāmis, upon whose order the work was undertaken. In the second verse, he again expresses gratitude to Śrīla Gopala Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmi, who originally began it. In this way, he invokes the blessings of these masters for the completion of the work. For further explanation, the reader may refer to the commentaries on the third, fourth, and fifth invocatory verses of Tattva Sandarbha. UBALI

An upadhi, or adjunct, is that which does not belong to the essential nature of an entity or object but is external to it. However, because the adjunct is somehow superimposed onto the object, the object comes to be identified with it. For example, a red color reflecting in a crystal is not part of the crystal but only appears to be so.

2 There are different readings of verse 5.11.13 of Srimad Bhagavatam. In some
editions, the word sākṣāt (direct or immediate) appears in place of satyah (real). Correspondingly, in some editions of Paramätma Sandarbha, the word satyaḥ appears in the verse itself in place of sākṣāt. Yet, even in these editions, when we come to Jiva Gosvāmi&rsquo;s gloss on the verse, it is unanimously seen that he comments only on the word sākṣāt and has nothing to say about the word satyaḥ. He interprets the word in an adverbial sense as qualifying svayan-jyotiḥ (self-revealing). The combination thus yields the meaning &ldquo;unmediatedly self-revealing.&rdquo; From this analysis, it would appear more consistent to give the word sākṣāt in the verse itself rather than satyaḥ, moja no hlboga m 3 kṣetrajña eta manaso vibhutir jivasya maya-racitasya nityahudido no pilles ävirhitaḥ kväpi tirohitaś ca śuddho vicaste hy aviśuddha-kartuḥ bazogmhsqua kṣetrajña ātmā puruṣaḥ puraṇaḥ sākṣāt svayañ-jyotir ajaḥ pareśaḥiquxs nārāyaṇo bhagavan vasudevaḥ sva-mayayātmany avadhiyamanaḥed at neqqe

[i.e., of Bhagavan as the Supreme Immanent Self], who will be described [in the next verse]. The jiva is [also] referred to as a witness of the field (kṣetrajña) because it is the knower (jñātṛ) of the field (kşetra) of its own two bodies [psychic and physical]. As is said:

By what characteristics is the mind [to be understood as] a prod- uct of maya? In response [Jada Bharata] says that the mind is that &ldquo;which pertains to the empirical self (jiva),&rdquo; meaning that it is created as an adjunct (upadhi) of the empirical self. This indicates that the mind is a creation with which the jiva becomes
We are here following the reading that is found in Jiva&rsquo;s Krama-sandarbha, sarva-kṣetrajñasya, to which the word bhagavatah has been added in at least one manuscript. The words vakṣyamanasya (having a possessive case ending) and mayaya (having an instrumental case ending) make it fairly clear that this is the correct reading. If, however, we take the reading as given in Paramatma Sandarbha (i.e., sarva-kşetrasya and not sarva-kṣetrajñasya), it would mean that the psychical apparatus is generated by the maya of the complete presentational field. This phrasing might create a doubt that some part of the field, such as the the mind, is excluded from it. Moreover, to make sense, the word vakṣyamaṇasya
(&ldquo;to be described later&rdquo;), qualifying sarva-kşetrasya, would then have to refer to the division of Paramatma Sandarbha described later in the book that deals with māyā and its two divisions of nimitta and upädäna (Anucchedas 48-65). In contrast to this somewhat confusing phrasing, the reading sarva-kṣetrajñasya (&ldquo;the maya of He who is the witness of all fields&rdquo;) makes things more simple and natural.

The word “impure” here means those actions that are undertaken from the separate self-sense rooted in non- awareness of Bhagavān (bhagavad-bahirmukha). How are the presentations (vibhūtis) or modifications [of the mind] described? They are continuous ( nitya), meaning that they are beginningless (anadita) and that they proceed in perpetual succession (anugata). How and when are these modifications [manifest and unmanifest ]? In response to this, [Jada Bharata] says, &ldquo;They appear during the waking and dreaming states, and disappear during deep sleep.&rdquo;

Commentary
IN THE FIRST BOOK of the Ṣat Sandarbhas, i.e., Tattva Sandarbha, Śrī Jiva Gosvāmi established the Bhagavata Purana as the supreme authority in the field of metaphysics. He also concluded that the Bhagavata Purana, which embodies the essence of the Vedas (see SB 1.1.2), primarily delineates the three topics of sambandha, abhidheya, and prayojana.
Sambandha means the relation between Absolute Reality (tattva) and Its energies. The cosmos is a manifestation of two energies in the form of the individual living beings (jivas) and pri- mordial nature (prakṛti or mayā). To understand sambandha, or relation, it is necessary to understand the sambandhi, or the refer- ent of the relation. In Bhagavat Sandarbha, the author explained in detail who the Absolute Reality is. In this book, he focuses on the individual beings and primordial nature, the two constituents of the cosmos, and their regulator, Paramātmā, a partial manifesta- tion of the tattva called Bhagavan. Bhagavat Sandarbha began with the citation of an important verse from Srimad Bhagavata Purana:
māyā-rahitaḥ, which is found in the Krama-sandarbha and some manuscripts of Paramatma Sandarbha.
? The word also appears in the last quarter of SB 5.11.13 in the locative case, &ldquo;in the Self&rdquo; (ätmani); there it has been glossed as sva-svarupe, &ldquo;in His own intrinsic being.&rdquo;

the All those who have realized Absolute Reality (tattva) describe that Pho Reality as nondual consciousness (advaya-jñāna). That Reality is t
referred to as Brahman, Paramātmā, and Bhagavan. (SB 1.2.11)&quot;
Bhagavat Sandarbha and Paramätma Sandarbha together form an extended explanation of this verse, which refers to Absolute Reality by the three appellations, Brahman, Paramātmā, and Bha- gavan. Brahman and Bhagavan were the subject matter of Bhagavat Sandarbha. Paramātmā will now be elaborately explained in this volume; hence, it is called Paramatma Sandarbha. Paramātmā was defined by Śri Jiva Gosvāmi in Bhagavat Sandarbha as follows:
on
moo bluoda midtbane fovan When this tattva in the form of Bhagavan, which has all the above- stated qualities and is the complete manifestation of Absolute Real- ity, is described or realized as the controller/regulator of living beings by the process described before, He is called Paramātmā, or God as the Supreme Immanent. (Bhagavat Sandarbha, Anuccheda 3)
The definitive feature of Paramātmā is His controlling or regu- lating power (aiśvarya). Individual beings are never fully indepen- dent, either in their conditioned or liberated state. As discussed in Bhagavat Sandarbha, there is only one supremely independent Reality, called Bhagavan, which Śrī Jīva Gosvāmi has identified as Śrī Kṛṣṇa along with His various lila-avataras, such as Rāma. In other words, the aspect of Krsna that embodies the regulatory or controlling function is called Paramātmā. In the spiritual world, Vaikuntha, Bhagavan Himself acts as Paramātmā, but in the mate- rial world He takes a special Paramātmā form. This is the subject of this Sandarbha.dandi honovoga

i
A doubt may be raised here. In the verse cited above (SB 1.2.11), Absolute Reality (tattva) is sequentially named as Brahman, Param- ātmā, and Bhagavän. Based on this order, it might be expected. that Paramātmā Sandarbha would come before Bhagavat Sandarbha, and not vice versa. There are two reasons for this reversal of order.
11 vadanti tat tattva-vidas tattvam yaj jñānam advayam
brahmeti paramatmeti bhagavan iti sabdyate

1 The Ontology of Paramātmā - The Supreme Immanent Self
First, there is no separate Sandarbha for the explanation of Brah- man. According to Śrī Jiva Gosvāmi, Brahma Sandarbha is con- tained within Bhagavat Sandarbha. Consequently, because Brah- man is to be explained previous to Paramātmā, as per the order of words in SB 1.2.11, Bhagavat Sandarbha, which contains Brahma Sandarbha, must come prior to Paramätma Sandarbha. Brahman is the manifestation or realization of Bhagavan devoid of qualifica- tion. Thus, Brahman cannot be comprehended without knowing Bhagavan.
13
BAYThe second reason is that according to the hermeneutic princi- ple, &ldquo;The order according to meaning overrides the word order,&rdquo; Bhagavat Sandarbha should come before Paramätma Sandarbha, because Bhagavan is the source of Paramātmā as well as of Brah- man. To understand these two in truth, knowledge of their source is indispensable.
Paramātmā is the regulator of the material energy, called māyā or prakṛti, which manifests the cosmos, and also of the individual living beings conditioned by the material energy. Material energy conditions a living being by covering his self-awareness and by pro- viding him with a material body. To understand the Controller, it is also necessary to understand the controlled. Hence, Śrī Jiva cites two verses spoken by Jada Bharata to King Rahugana that delineate both the characteristics of the individual self and Paramātmā in relation to phenomenality, or mayā. Both are here called kṣetrajña, i.e., &ldquo;the knower of the presentational field,&rdquo; meaning the witness of the field of all phenomena, both internal and external, that are presented to consciousness.
Like many verses in the Bhāgavatam, these two also involve a certain ambiguity in that they do not overtly state that the kṣetra- jñas they describe are different from each other. The verses could therefore be interpreted from the monistic point of view, which holds that there is only a single consciousness that appears both as

the individual beings as well as Paramātmā. In his commentaries to both the previous and following verses, Śrīdhara Svāmī does make the statement that the two kṣetrajñas are different, as Parameśvara and jiva, a fact acceptable to all Vedantis. Śrīdhara, however, seems to lean toward the monistic view by saying, &ldquo;The kṣetrajña, witness to the three states of wakefulness, dreaming, and deep sleep, is the ātmā, i.e., the Reality (tattva).&rdquo; Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī clarifies the mat- ter in his commentary, with special reference in the next subsec- tion (1.2) to Bhagavad Gita, where the subject of kṣetra and kṣetra- jña is discussed. He specifically chooses these two verses so that one cannot misconstrue the radical monistic theory of the self&rsquo;s absolute identity with Brahman.
The word kṣetra, which literally means &ldquo;a field,&rdquo; is often used to signify the physical body. Just as seeds are sown in a field, grow and produce some fruit, the physical body serves as a field of action, karma, which is the seed from which the fruits of happiness or mis- ery are produced. One who knows the field and its modifications is called kṣetrajña (jña means &ldquo;a knower&rdquo;), so it is applicable both to the jiva and Paramātmā, who is the companion of each jiva in the physical body. Nevertheless, though both are kṣetrajñas, they are not equal. The jiva misidentifies with the two types of material bod- ies, physical (gross) and psychical (subtle), which are products of māyā. The subtle body is the psychic apparatus attending the jiva, which includes the mind along with the five cognitive senses, the five conative (or active) senses, and the five divisions of the vital force (prāna). These two types of bodies are called the upadhis of the jiva.
bat
Upadhi means &ldquo;limitation,&rdquo; &ldquo;condition,&rdquo; &ldquo;adjunct,&rdquo; &ldquo;nomencla- ture,&rdquo; or something external that has been superimposed upon and limits an object or entity. When a red rose is in proximity to a crys- tal, the latter reflects the color of the rose and appears reddish even though by nature it is colorless. This reddishness is the upadhi of the crystal. Similarly, a jīva, who is in reality pure (suddha), or in other words, transcendental to māyā, as stated in SB 5.11.12, appears to reflect or possess the modifications of the mind in the form of happiness and misery when in their proximity.(m)or

1 The Ontology of Paramātmā - The Supreme Immanent Self
The mental modifications are the upadhis of the jiva, because they impose a limitation on the pure nature of the jiva. The gross body is another upadhi, restricting the awareness of the jiva within its bounds. The mind is here called the &ldquo;impure agent&rdquo; (aviśuddha- kartuḥ). The mind itself is inert by nature and has no inherent agency. It exhibits consciousness only by the association of the kṣetrajña, the individual conscious being. Once it is intelligized, it makes use of the senses and the vital force to perform action and thus becomes an agent. It is called impure because it functions only for its own independent and separative interest, in non-awareness of Bhagavan, who is the source and proprietor of everything in the cosmos. Not acknowledging the existence and ownership of Bhagavan is the impurity of the mind. food bowos
It should be noted that the term jiva can be used to indicate the living entity, both in its pure, transcendental, and eternal nature, as well as in its conditioned state. Therefore, the term jivopädhi has been used by the commentators to gloss the word jivasya, appearing in the verse, in order to clarify that it is the adjuncts or upādhis that are a product of illusion (māyā) and not the living entity itself.
The jiva considers the happiness and misery occurring in the body to be its own and thus remains absorbed in these feeling tones, ignorant of its own true nature, which is transcendental, beyond all material happiness and misery. Therefore, although the jiva is distinct from matter, it considers itself to be material. In this state, it engages in materialistic, non-integral pursuits, trying to fulfill its material desires. This conditioning of the jiva has no beginning, meaning that it is without prior cause, and hence it is causeless.&quot; It is for this reason that the vṛttis, or mental modifications, are called nitya. Here, the word nitya (lit., &ldquo;eternal&rdquo;) does not mean that they are always manifest, but that their flow has no beginning. Every vṛtti is temporary but there is a continuous flow of them in the
14 A cause is defined as that which must invariably exist prior to the effect that it
produces. So if something is beginningless, it must be without cause. The reason why the jiva&rsquo;s conditioning is stressed as being beginningless (i.e., causeless) is to refute the idea of original sin, or of a falldown from Vaikuntha, or of an

(taṭastha), or other misconceptions that are rampant in the Vaisnava world. ad

waking and dream states. The vṛttis of the mind are perceived by the jiva in those states, while in deep sleep there is no experience arising from either of the two types of bodies. There is no external experience in this state.
The other kṣetrajña is Paramātmā. He also witnesses the phys- ical and psychical bodies of the jiva but is not influenced or condi- tioned by them. This is exemplified in the Mundaka Upanisad (3.1.1) by the allegory of two birds sitting on a tree out of which one eats the fruits of the tree and the other simply looks on. The reason for this is that Paramātmā is svayañ-jyoti, or self-luminous. He is not dependent on anyone else for His existence, knowledge, or power. Being an expansion of Bhagavan, He is inherently endowed with many of the same powers. Thus, unlike the jiva, He never comes under the sway of the extrinsic energy, māyā.
Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi notes that the verb avadhiyamāna (&ldquo;is being placed,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;is established&rdquo;) in the second principal verse of this anuccheda (SB 5.11.13) is in the passive voice (karma-kartṛ) in the phrase, &ldquo;who is established in the Self by His own maya.&rdquo; The use of the passive voice could be interpreted to imply that maya is the agent who has caused Paramātmā to be placed interior to the indi- vidual self. Śrī Jiva clarifies, however, that Paramatma&rsquo;s establish- ment in the Self is not effected through any external agency, but rather by virtue of the potency that is innate to His own being (sva-mayaya), meaning through His own intrinsic potency (sva- svarupa-śakti). This confirms the independent status of Bhagavan, who performs actions through His own energies. Furthermore, the word ātmani (&ldquo;in the Self&rdquo;) here is taken to mean &ldquo;in His own Self&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;within the individual self,&rdquo; which Śrī Jiva explains as meaning &ldquo;in His own intrinsic being&rdquo; (sva-svarupa).
The word purusa (person) here has a particular significance. Etymologically, it means &ldquo;one who reposes in the city.&rdquo; The &ldquo;city&rdquo; (pura) signifies the bodies of living beings and therefore, like kṣetra- jña, puruşa can refer to either the individual self or Paramātmā, who is present as a witness in each body. As will be made clear in Sections 2-4 of this volume, the word puruşa refers to the three aspects of Bhagavan, the puruṣāvatāras, who expand from Him for

the sake of facilitating the creative unfoldment of the cosmos. In one of these aspects, He is present as the indweller in every body as the Immanent Self.thodshower headpik golais
The word väsudeva (from the verbal root √vas, &ldquo;to reside&rdquo;) sim- ilarly indicates that Bhagavan as the Immanent Self knows all bod- ies because He resides in them and is therefore the prime kṣetra- jña. The living being is the secondary kṣetrajña, since it knows only one particular body. This will be explained further with recourse to Bhagavad Gitā.

Here, in the statement, &ldquo;and know Me also to be the kṣetrajña,&rdquo; [the words &ldquo;and&rdquo; (ca) and &ldquo;whatsoever&rdquo; (api) are to be syntac- tically applied as follows:] &ldquo;And in all fields whatsoever, you should know Me also to be the kṣetrajña. [I am] not like the jiva, whose knowledge is restricted only to its own individual field.&rdquo; This alone is the intended meaning of the statement.

By pointing out that both Iśvara and the individual self have a common substratum [i.e., that they both share the character- istic of being knowers of the field], [Krsna here] is not indicat- ing that the substantive Reality to be known (i.e., the know- able - jñeya) is consciousness alone devoid of all attributes. If that were the case, the phrase &ldquo;within all kṣetras&rdquo; would be redundant. Moreover, the knowable (jñeya) is pointed out [in the same chapter of the Gita] as being specifically inclusive of attributes. This is indicated in GĪTĀ 13.12, &ldquo;I shall now describe that [Reality] which is to be known (jñeya),&rdquo; and in GITĀ 13.13, &ldquo;That [Supreme] knowable has hands and feet everywhere, with eyes, heads, and faces all around.&rdquo;&quot;&quot; Again, in GĪTĀ 13.7-1118 knowledge (jñāna) too will be defined in precisely the same manner [i.e., knowledge too is of a substantive inclusive of attributes and not that of unqualified consciousness].

The term jñeya (knowable) as it is used here assumes that the Reality being spoken of is naturally endowed with qualities by which It can be known. The implication is that an entirely unqualified entity is inscrutable and hence unknowable (ajñeya).

1 The Ontology of Paramātmā - The Supreme Immanent Self
Moreover, if Krsna&rsquo;s intention in the phrase, &ldquo;know Me also to be the kṣetrajña,&rdquo; had been to define knowledge as pertaining to an Absolute Reality utterly devoid of attributes, by equating their shared conscious substratum, as in the mantra, &ldquo;You are That&rdquo; (tat tvam asi, CHU 6.8.7), then Kṛṣṇa would have said, &ldquo;In My view, knowledge of the kṣetrajña and Iśvara is [true] knowledge&rdquo; and not &ldquo;knowledge of the field and of [both these] knowers of the field.&rdquo;

Tsub
However, the meaning of the statement, &ldquo;knowledge of the kṣetra and of kṣetrajña, in My opinion, is what is meant by knowledge,&rdquo; is as follows: &ldquo;Knowledge of both items inclusively, of kṣetra and kṣetrajña, is considered to be knowledge of Me alone, because the purpose of such knowledge is exclusively the knowledge of Me (Paramātmā), as stated in the Brahma-sutra, &ldquo;The deliberation (paramarśa) on the individual self is in order to know the other (anyartha) [i.e., the Supreme Self]&rdquo; (vs 1.3.20)19 This is in keeping with the fact that the knowable (jñeya) is stated to be only one (GITA 13.12), and it is indeed appropriate [because the Reality to be known has already been described in Bhāgavata Purana (SB 1.2.11) as nondual in nature].
न च निरीश्वरसाङ्ख्यवत् क्षेत्रक्षेत्रज्ञमात्रविभागादत्र ज्ञानं मतम् । “माम्” इत्यनेनेश्वरस्यापे- क्षितत्वात् ।
Nor is it right to interpret the word &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo; as it is in the non-theistic Sankhya philosophy, which understands it to mean merely [realization of] the distinction between the field (kṣetra) and its individuated knowers (kṣetrajña), because in GĪTĀ 13.2, the pronoun mām (Me) necessitates the inclusion of a Supreme Knower, i.e., Iśvara (iśvarasyāpekṣitatvāt).asaloge

Nor can we agree with the vivarta doctrine that the personhood (puruşatva) of God (Iśvara) is but an appearance born out of illu- sion, because then His words in the form of revealed scriptures, such as the Gitä along with the Vedas, would be rendered unau- thoritative, thus insinuating the Buddhist philosophy. Such being the case, it would be just as illogical for the proponents of vivarta-vāda to comment on these scriptures as it is for the Buddhists.

Nor can it be argued that even if the personhood of God (Isvara) is admitted to be real, we must still draw on [relevant] state- ments from Isvara&rsquo;s other revealed scriptures, wherein it is stated that knowledge of the unqualified Absolute (nirviseșa- jñāna) alone is the means to liberation. [This is indefensi- ble] because the intention of the previous chapter of the Gitā (Chapter 12) was to show the inferiority of such knowledge [in response to Arjuna&rsquo;s question in the first verse]. In that very chapter, Śrī Kṛṣṇa made the following statement in regard to His exclusive devotees: &ldquo;But I quickly become the liberator of those who offer all actions to Me, who are wholly devoted to Me, and who worship Me, meditating on Me through the yoga of exclusive devotion. O Partha, without delay I lift them up from the ocean of repeated birth and death because of their singular absorption in Me&rdquo; (GITA 12.6-7)20 Here Bhagavan does

Bhagavan Himself confirms the same in the Eleventh Canto of Srimad Bhagavatam: &ldquo;Whatever may be attained by perform- ing meritorious acts (karma), penances, the culture of jñāna, non-attachment, yoga, charity, religious virtue (dharma), or any other means of ultimate welfare, is easily attained by My devotee simply by engagement in bhakti-yoga to Me.

Here again [in the 13th chapter of the Gita], so that the specific praises [of the personhood of God] made in the previous chap- ter do not go in vain, and after indicating that knowledge means knowledge of the qualified Absolute [in verses 13.7-11], Śrī Kṛṣṇa concludes by saying that such knowledge is easily attainable if pursued along with devotion:
In this way, the field (kşetra), knowledge (jñāna), and the know- able (jñeya) have been described in brief. Knowing this, My devotee attains My nature. (GITĀ 13.18) 24

So here, after reminding us of this by citing the knowable (jñeya) together with the knowledge of the field and its knowers, Kṛṣṇa continues in the following verses by showing that the jiva- nature of the individuated knower [vyaşți-kṣetrajña] and the isvara-nature of the aggregate knower [samaşti-kṣetrajña] are both imperishable: wa

bas There are two kinds of purusas in this world - the perishableart and the imperishable. All these embodied beings (bhūta) are ha perishable, whereas the immutable [self] (küṭa-stha) is called the imperishable. But different from these two is the Supreme Puruşa, called Paramātmā. He, the imperishable regulator, enters the three worlds and then sustains them. (GĪTĀ 15.16-17)27

In the Gită verse [quoted above (13.22)], the word upadraṣṭā (wit- ness) means &ldquo;the Supreme Witness&rdquo;; anumantă (sanctioner) means &ldquo;He who inspires the living beings in accordance with their past actions&rdquo;; bharta (sustainer) means &ldquo;He who provides nourishment&rdquo;; bhoktā (maintainer) means &ldquo;the protector&rdquo;;28 maheśvara (the almighty regulator) means &ldquo;the superintendent of all&rdquo;; and paramātmā (the Supreme Self) means &ldquo;the indweller in all.&rdquo; This is how the words are to be explained.

Regarding the next two verses quoted above (GITA 15.16-17), the word kuṭa-stha (the immutable [self]) means &ldquo;one who does not undergo change through time,&rdquo; according to Amara-kosa (3.1.73).29 This is the pure individual conscious being (suddha- jiva), because in the very next verse it is said, &ldquo;But different from these two is the Supreme Purusa (uttamaḥ puruṣaḥ), called Paramātmā.&rdquo; Thus, here also [in GITĀ 15.16-17], the field (kṣetra), the knower of the individual field (kṣetrajña), and the knower of

1 The Ontology of Paramātmā - The Supreme Immanent Self
the aggregate of all fields (sarva-kṣetrajña) are being indicated [as corresponding to the three divisions of kṣara-puruşa (the perishable body), akṣara-puruşa (the imperishable self), and uttama-puruşa (the Supreme Self)]. By use of the word &ldquo;differ- ent&rdquo; (anya) [in GITA 15.17], Kṛṣṇa indicates that the latter two imperishable beings are indeed different. It is not possible for them to give up their respective natures. By this it is also shown that they never exist without attributes.

Therefore, Kṛṣṇa&rsquo;s statement, &ldquo;He attains My nature&rdquo; (mad- bhāvāyopapadyate, GĪTĀ 13.18),3° also means that he attains the same status or condition as Bhagavan (särṣṭi) [not an attribute- less state of liberation]. The import is that although both are equal in terms of their imperishability, the jiva is the one who is captivated by material nature due to its inferior strength, and to dissolve this captivation, Iśvara alone is to be known as the Reality meant to be worshiped.

hotcup 292190 owl txen a (alon)Voldetudiat edi) pt-out brow In this portion of the first anuccheda, Śrī Jīva discusses Chapter 13 of Bhagavad Gita where the concepts of kṣetra and kṣetrajña are introduced, along with an elaborate discussion of Purușa and prakṛti. This analysis is also further related to the correspond- ing portions of the Gita&rsquo;s 15th chapter. In both these chapters, Bhagavan Śrī Kṛṣṇa not only differentiates between conscious- ness and non-conscious phenomena, but also between the indi- vidual consciousness and the supreme conscious entity, or Param- ātmā. In the course of doing so, it is necessary for Śrī Jiva to deal with erroneous interpretations of these passages that deny any distinction between the two kinds of conscious beings. Id

Śrī Jiva begins by referring to Krsna&rsquo;s words in GITA 13.1-2, which identify the presence of two distinct kṣetrajñas in the body, i.e., the individual ātmā and Paramātmā. In doing so, he refutes vivarta-vāda, the Advaita doctrine that acknowledges the existence of only one ātmā, otherwise called Brahman. The statement, &ldquo;And know Me also to be the kṣetrajña residing in all kṣetras,&rdquo; clearly affirms that besides the individual self there is another kṣetrajña. This is the implication of the word ca (also). An individual ātmā knows only one particular kṣetra, but Paramātmā knows them all. To emphasize this point, the verse employs the compound sarva-kṣetresu, &ldquo;in all bodies&rdquo; (GITA 13.2)3150 audi
Moreover, the word ca highlights the distinction between the individual self and the Supreme Self. Sankara&rsquo;s radical nondual- istic (kevaladvaita) philosophy adopts the view that there is one absolute, unqualified Reality called Brahman, which manifests as Paramātmā when delimited by pure sattva-guna (i.e., perpet- ual being unmixed with rajas and tamas) and as the individual ātmā when delimited by sattva-guna mixed with the other gunas.32 Adherents of this doctrine claim that there is no ultimate differ- ence between the two kṣetrajñas. For them, the one unqualified conscious Reality is the ultimate and unique substantive to be known, jñeya. Everything else is ultimately mithya, or devoid of ontological reality. iw bae bauons lis 250 Bus

Sby words such as sat (cause) and asat (effect). (Bhagavad Gita,
Sankara-bhāṣya 13.2) 33i
Śrī Jiva refutes Sankara&rsquo;s interpretation by arguing that were this the case, the compound sarva-kṣetresu, &ldquo;in all kṣetras,&rdquo; would be redundant, as the one who knows all bodies would be identi- cal with the one who knows the individual body. Then he would have used the word eva instead of api (i.e., kṣetrajñaṁ eva mām viddhi, &ldquo;Know Me alone to be the kṣetrajña&rdquo;), and sarva-kşetreşu would serve no additional purpose because there would be only one kṣetrajña. Thus, Kṛṣṇa does not instruct that there is one absolute unqualified consciousness that alone is real but which appears as many by the influence of māyā.
Moreover, later in GITA 13.2, Ultimate Reality is stated to be knowable (jñeya). An object devoid of form, energies, and quali- ties cannot be knowable. Furthermore, the knowable is described as qualified, not as devoid of attributes. This contradicts the Advai- tavāda concept that Ultimate Reality is unqualified indivisible con- sciousness alone that appears as many due only to the upadhis in the form of material bodies. The qualified nature of the knowable is expressed as follows: bus mitu si ai viilsel auobanoo
That [Supreme] knowable has hands and feet everywhere, with eyes, heads, and faces all around, and with ears in all directions. It abides, pervading everything in the world. (GITA 13.13)34 linW In this po
of Here the affirmation that Bhagavan has senses and limbs, even though they are of an all-pervading nature, shows that they are real and that He is thus a conscious being with senses and not mere unqualified consciousness. Furthermore, the knowledge described in verses 13.7-11 also pertains to a Reality inclusive of attributes, because ceaseless exclusive devotion is counted as one

of its elements (verse 10, mayi cananya-yogena bhaktir avyabhică- riņi). Such devotion is not possible toward an unqualified substan- tive. If there were no real distinction between the individual wit- ness (jiva-kṣetrajña) and the Supreme Witness (isvara-kṣetrajña), any instruction to the former to be devoted to the latter would be meaningless.
The radical nondualists may reply that such instructions are only meant to help the conditioned self to realize its Brahman nature. They claim that worship of God is an intermediary step for less intelligent practitioners. For example, Nilakantha, while commenting on GĪTĀ 12.2, writes:
ΤΟ
sagunaod
doua
While indicating the superiority of nirguna [meditation], specifi- cally because it is said to be difficult to attain, Śrī Kṛṣṇa speaks the present verse, linguistically affirming the importance of saguna [worship]: &ldquo;Those who worship (i.e., meditate upon) Me as the Supreme Isvara, do so with their minds constantly fixed upon (i.e., entering) Me (the qualified Brahman), being endowed with supe- rior (i.e., sättvika) faith (śraddha), meaning belief in My personal berexistence, or in other words, with the conviction that by worship- ing Paramātmā, they will certainly be delivered by Him. In reality, it is the jñānis [Advaitavadīs] whom I look upon as My very Self, as previously stated, &lsquo;I regard the jñānīs as My very Self&rsquo; (7.18). Yet, being omniscient, I take the side even of such fools [the saguna wor- shipers] out of compassion for them, and it is in this sense only that I consider them as the best of those who are united with Me.&rdquo; (Bhāva-dipa 12.2)35

This is how the Advaitavadīs interpret Krsna&rsquo;s reply to Arjuna. But if the jiva believes that he is identical to this Iśvara, which cer- tainly is the case for those who aim at nirguna Brahman realization, how could he be sincerely devoted to Him? If a non-devotee actor

on stage plays the role of a devotee and another that of God, can the former&rsquo;s show of devotion be considered genuine? Certainly not. An actor can make a portrayal of devotion but that would not ben- efit him spiritually. Indeed, from the point of view of bhakti theol- ogy, to regard oneself as identical to Isvara would be tantamount to an offence.
Jiva raises the following question: Some say that the common conscious substratum (sāmānādhikaranya) of the two kṣetrajñas described in GĪTĀ 13.1-2 should be interpreted according to the famous statement from Chandogya Upanisad (6.8.7), &ldquo;You are that&rdquo; (tat tvam asi). In this interpretation, called pratibimba-vāda, the pronoun &ldquo;that&rdquo; here refers to the unqualified unlimited conscious- ness and the pronoun &ldquo;you&rdquo; to the conditioned or limited con- sciousness. Though the two are not equal in our experience, one being unlimited and the other limited, they can be understood as such through the analytical principle of bhaga-tyaga-lakṣaṇa, or discarding one part of a statement to obtain the correct meaning.
Here, if the adjectives &ldquo;unlimited&rdquo; and &ldquo;limited&rdquo; are dropped, then what remains is &ldquo;consciousness.&rdquo; Then &ldquo;you,&rdquo; the conditioned reality, can be equated with the unconditioned reality. In other words, a conditioned jiva (tvam-padartha) can be equal to the qual- ityless reality (tat-padartha) only if its conditioning is dropped. In the same way, the Advaitavadi may argue that in the Gītā verses under discussion, the purpose of mentioning two types of kṣetrajña is to offer instruction about the qualityless reality called Brahman, with whom the individuated knower is equated, just as is done in the mantra from the Chandogya Upanisad cited above.mitre
Śrī Jīva replies that if such were Krsna&rsquo;s intention, He would have expressed Himself differently and said, &ldquo;Knowledge of the kṣetrajña and Iśvara is called knowledge&rdquo; (kṣetrajña-iśvarayor jñānam yat taj jñānam) instead of &ldquo;Knowledge of the field and its knowers is called knowledge&rdquo; (kṣetra-kṣetrajñayor jñānaṁ yat taj jñānam).
The statement tat tvam asi (&ldquo;You are that&rdquo;) teaches the iden- tity of the limited consciousness, i.e., the individual living being referred to by the pronoun tvam or &ldquo;you,&rdquo; and the unlimited or
30
Het inenamm! sm 1 Paramātmā Defined la volino will
all-pervading consciousness called Brahman, referred to by the pronoun tat or &ldquo;That.&rdquo; It does not, however, teach the identity of the inert material body (kṣetra) and the supreme consciousness (Iśvara).
Jiva Gosvāmi here reads the verse somewhat differently from the way it is taken customarily. He joins mama (My) with jñānam (knowledge) rather than matam (view). Thus, the sentence, instead of reading, &ldquo;In My view (matam mama), knowledge of the field and the knower of the field is [true] knowledge (jñāna),&rdquo; is construed as &ldquo;Knowledge of the field and the knower of the field is understood (mata) to be knowledge of Me (mama jñānam).” The intent is that knowledge of the body, the individual self, the Sup- reme Self, and the interrelations between them is meant to lead to an understanding of the Supreme Person, Śrī Kṛṣṇa.
To support this argumentation, Śrī Jiva refers to a sūtra (vs 1.3.20) from the Daharadhikarana of the Brahma-sutra, where a section of the Chandogya Upaniṣad (8.1.1 ff.) is under scrutiny. The Upanisad states that there is a tiny (dahara) lotus-like space (ākāśa) in the &ldquo;city of Brahman&rdquo; (i.e., the body) and that one should seek out and inquire into that which dwells in that space. What then is this space? It could mean the material element of ether (bhūtākāśa), the individual self (jiva), or Brahman / Visņu. The first part of the Daharadhikaraṇa (vs 1.3.14-17) establishes that this &ldquo;sky&rdquo; (ākāśa), a word that is also used to indicate Brahman, cannot be the material element ether.
The next portion of the adhikarana raises the possibility that the dahara is a reference to the individual self, as indicated fur- ther in CHU 8.3.4, but then refutes this proposition: &ldquo;If it is argued that because there is a reference to the other, namely the jiva, in the dahara section, and that therefore ākāśa means the jiva, this is denied as impossible&rdquo; (itara-paramarsat sa iti cen näsambha- vät, vs 1.3.18). In the section of the Chandogya Upanisad to which this sutra refers, the word prajapati refers to the jiva, and it is pointed out that when the jiva meditates on Brahman, the eightfold
31
I The Ontology of Paramātmā - The Supreme Immanent Self
qualities appear in him. These qualities naturally exist in Brah- man, not in the jiva. Thus, the word dahara does not refer to the jiva but to Brahman, by meditation on whom the jiva is endowed with the eightfold qualities. the poin
After this, another doubt is raised: &ldquo;Why, then, is there a ref- erence to the jiva in this section related to dahara&rdquo; (i.e., CHU 8.3.4)? This question is answered by sutra vs 1.3.20 cited by Śrī Jiva here in Paramatma Sandarbha, &ldquo;The deliberation (parămarśa) on the individual self is in order to know the other (anyartha) [i.e., the Supreme Self].&rdquo; The meaning here is that the reference to the jiva is intended to impart knowledge of the Supreme Brahman. It indicates that when a jīva attains perfection, it also becomes endowed with the eightfold qualities (as in CHU 8.1.5) belonging to the Supreme Reality.
In other words, although it appears that the Chandogya Upani- sad is describing the jiva, its intention is to explain the nature of the Supreme. Likewise, Śrī Jīva says that although Bhagavan Śrī Kṛṣṇa is describing kṣetra and kṣetrajña in the verses cited, His intention is to disclose knowledge about Himself, because the jñeya, the sub- stantive Reality to be known, is expressed in the singular. If there were two jñeyas (a kṣetra and a kṣetrajña), the dual number would have been used. Moreover, since Kṛṣṇa is the Ultimate Reality, as Śrī Jiva has established in Bhagavat Sandarbha, He is that which is most worthy to be known (jñeya), because knowledge of Him includes knowledge of everything else, as stated in the Mundaka Upanisad: &ldquo;O most honorable one, what is that Reality by knowing which all this becomes clearly known&rdquo; (MUU 1.1.3)?37
Jed One may misconstrue that Kṛṣṇa&rsquo;s teachings in this section of the Gită speak only of kṣetra and kṣetrajña, the former referring to prakṛti and the latter to purusa, the two ontological categories of the classical Sankhya philosophy of Kapila, and that therefore He is just
36 ātmāpahata-päpmā vijaro vimṛtyur visoko vijighatso&rsquo;pipasaḥ satya-kāmaḥat air

The Supreme Self is free from sin, old age, death, grief, hunger, and thirst. He has infallible desires and infallible will.

32Ha insnemmt sm 1 Paramātmā Defined golon
confirming the classical Sankhya view. Śrī Jiva disagrees with this idea because Kapila does not himself mention Iśvara, the Supreme Person, but in GĪTĀ 13.2, Kṛṣṇa says mam (Me), which implies that there is a third reality beyond material nature and the individual living beings. This is confirmed later in Bhagavad Gitā: ematea ved blow noin vulli sonia vibodios on sved blow There are two kinds of purusas in this world - the perishable and the imperishable. All these embodied beings (bhūta) are perish- able, whereas the immutable [self] (kūṭa-stha) is called the imper- ishable. But different from these two is the Supreme Purușa, Pascalled Paramātmā. He, the imperishable regulator, enters the
three worlds and then sustains them. (GĪTĀ 15.16-17)38
Here Śrī Kṛṣṇa clearly mentions three divisions of ontolog- ical being the kṣara-puruşa (the self conditioned by a perish- able body, baddha-jiva), the akṣara-puruşa (the imperishable self, mukta-jiva), and the uttama-puruşa (the Supreme Self). These refer to kṣetra (the body-mind complex of the empirical self), kṣetra- jña (the pure self), and jñeya (the Supreme Self), respectively of the 13th chapter. If the Advaitavada theory that there is only one type of kṣetrajña is admitted, there would be incoherency in Kṛṣṇa&rsquo;s instruction. One may object that the physical body cannot be called a purusa. Although this argument is valid, it is not the body in isolation that is called purușa. Rather, the body along with the individual self is called the purusa. Such usage is also seen in the Taittiriya Upanisad (2.1.1).39 In that Upanisad, the first three puru- şasannamaya, pranamaya, and manomaya - correspond to the presentational field (kṣetra), the vijñānamaya-puruşa refers to the individuated knowers (kṣetrajñas), and the anandamaya-purusa is the Supreme Self, who is to be known (jñeya).
A further objection may be raised: In Sankarācārya&rsquo;s vivarta- vāda philosophy, Iśvara (Śrī Kṛṣṇa) is also considered to be an

illusion and does not refer to the Ultimate Reality. As said earlier, the vivarta-väda holds that there is only one reality called Brah- man; everything else is an illusion, including Iśvara, or God. Śrī Jiva responds to this by saying that if this were the case, then the statements of scriptures like the Bhagavad Gita and the Upanisads would have no authority, since an illusory person would have uttered them. Moreover, there would be no difference between the Vedic schools of theology and Buddhism, since Buddhists neither accept the revealed scriptures nor the authority of their speaker.
The vivarta-vādī might further argue that even if Iśvara and the scriptures spoken by Him are admitted to be real, the essence of their teaching is to inform us about Brahman, the qualityless reality. So, in case this insight is not made evident from the verses of the Gītā under discussion, then one has to supplement his understanding by recourse to other revealed texts. To this, Śrī Jiva responds that in the Gitä Kṛṣṇa deliberately and clearly states that knowledge of Brahman and intuition of identity with Brahman is inferior to knowledge of Bhagavan and devotion to Him:
no vino a
Arjuna asks: Between those devotees who are constantly devoted to You in the manner previously described, who worship You in bolle

Bhagavan replies: Those who, having fixed their minds upon Me, are constantly devoted to Me, and who, being endowed with tran- scendental faith, worship Me - them I regard as the best of yogis. (GĪTĀ 12.1-2)40
wom
Kṛṣṇa also says that meditation on the qualityless Brahman is troublesome (GĪTĀ 12.5), but that He personally intervenes to lib- erate His devotees from the ocean of material suffering, as in the

verse quoted by Śri Jiva (GITA 12.7). Later, of course, Kṛṣṇa states that He is the source of the Brahman feature:is
I am indeed the source and shelter of Brahman, of imperishable f liberation, of eternal religion, and of absolute bliss. (GĪTĀ 14.27)11
This suggests that Brahman is nothing but an unqualified aspect of Bhagavan, as argued by Śri Jiva in Bhagavat Sandarbha (Anucche- das 3, 6, and 7). From all these statements it is clear that the essen- tial intent of scripture is to establish Bhagavan as the Ultimate Real- ity, not Brahman. Śrī Jiva thus shows on the authority of the Bhaga- vad Gita that there are two kṣetrajñas, the individual living being and Paramātmā. They are distinct and can never be absolutely one.42 Wherever their oneness is indicated, it is only because the jiva is an integrated part of Paramātmā and thus shares some iden- tity of nature with Him. But they are never identical, as stated in the Gītā:
In this way, the field (kṣetra), knowledge (jñāna), and the knowabler (jñeya) have been described in brief. Knowing this, My devotee attains My nature. (GĪTĀ 13.18)43
According to this verse, the individuated knower is certainly not the Supreme Reality to be known (jñeya).
The Advaitavada scholars interpret the statement &ldquo;attains to My nature&rdquo; to mean that the jiva becomes one with the Supreme. But this contradicts numerous other statements, such as, &ldquo;But there is another, the Supreme Purușa, who is called Paramātmā&rdquo; (GĪTĀ 15.17). Śrī Jiva thus glosses mad-bhava here as sārṣṭi, or &ldquo;[the liberation of attaining] equal rank, status, or power as Bhagavan.&rdquo; This is supported by the Chandogya Upanisad (CHU 8.1.5), which states that a liberated jīva attains the eightfold attributes of God.

1 The Ontology of Paramätma - The Supreme Immanent Self
Thus, it is perfectly clear that the individual jiva is ever distinct from and subservient to the Supreme Person, or Purusottama. He alone is the Substantive Reality to be known (jñeya), and the means for the self-revelation of that truth is unconditional devotion. After being endowed with this realization, the jiva becomes like Him, and yet still remains ever distinct and subservient.

Therefore [in light of the above discussion], we must re-examine the statements of the Gitä (13.1-2), beginning with, &ldquo;This body is called the field (kṣetra),&rdquo;&rdquo;&quot; in the following way: The pronoun idam (this) indicates that which is directly perceptible or in proximity to each individual [i.e., every individual directly per- ceives his or her own body]. The use of the singular for both sarira and kṣetra in this verse should be taken to mean the indi- vidual bodies [and not just one in any absolute monistic sense], taking an individual body as representative of the whole class. This is necessarily the case because in the next verse the plural, &ldquo;in all kṣetras,&ldquo;45 is used.

Even so, if by these words Kṛṣṇa&rsquo;s inten- tion was to equate the jiva to Himself, then instead of saying, &ldquo;Know Me also to be the knower (kṣetrajña) situated within all fields,&rdquo; He would have simply said, &ldquo;Know Me to be the kṣetrajña also of that precise nature&rdquo; or &ldquo;Know Me [to be the kṣetrajña] to that exact same extent,&rdquo; and there would have been no need of the addition, &ldquo;in all fields, O Bharata.&rdquo; Instead, He considered it necessary to speak of two kṣetrajñas, as in the

two Bhāgavatam verses [cited as the principal verses of this section, i.e., SB 5.11.12-13]. Likewise, the Brahma-sutra states, &ldquo;Two ātmās have entered the cavity of the heart, because it is so described in the scriptures&rdquo; (vs 1.2.11).50

Furthermore, Śrī Kṛṣṇa concludes [this topic, GITA 13.21-22] by saying that there are indeed two types of kṣetrajña. Therefore, because the introductory meaning is dependent upon the con- clusion, this alone is the appropriate understanding. [The same principle of the conclusion determining the proper understand- ing of an introductory statement applies in the following text of] Brahma-sutra: &ldquo;If it be argued that the effect does not exist in the cause because the Śruti speaks of the world&rsquo;s non-existence (asat) prior to creation, this is not so, because concluding state- ments show that the word [asat] is used instead to denote a difference of characteristics [and not absolute non-existence]&rdquo; (vs 2.1.17).51

viabпooses of roast bluoda smo In the statement, &ldquo;knowledge of the field (kṣetra) and of the knower of the field (kṣetrajña)&rdquo; (GITA 13.2), the knowledge per- taining to the field, which will be shown either as acquired through the senses or as not so acquired, is understood as My [Kṛṣṇa&rsquo;s] knowledge alone. Similarly, the knowledge present to the knower of the field, which was previously described as that related to its corresponding individual body, is also understood as My [Kṛṣṇa&rsquo;s] knowledge alone. This is so [in regard to the field] because it is My [Krsna&rsquo;s] knowledge alone that pervades

Again, it is so [in regard to the knowers of the field] because it is My consciousness alone that pervades the knowers of the fields as individuated portions of My consciousness.

De Sinno lo BŚrī Bhagavan replied: O dvija, the all-pervading Deva is the Sup-
reme Brahman, the eternal, the universal consciousness of this sim boworld, who is of the nature of transcendental bliss, nondiffer-nt ent from Vasudeva, and as effulgent as hundreds of fires, suns, and moons. Although Bhagavan Vasudeva is the Supreme Con- troller (Parameśvara), being intrinsically endowed with such qualities, He caused a movement in His own radiance through His own potency. Being the personification of light, this Bhaga- vän emitted Acyuta, who was endowed with that same radiance.
aid Taking shelter of Bhagavän Väsudeva, Acyuta, who has infalli-a <em>ble splendor, expanded His own form just as a cloud situated in Tanthe sky sends forth rain. As the ocean agitates itself and pro-b duces waves, He incited His own Self and thus produced a form that was true and radiant. This Bhagavan, who is pure con&ndash; sciousness and self-luminous, after generating His own Self by ba Himself, caused an unlimited form to become manifest, called Purusa, who is of the nature of all-pervasive light.
This Supreme Regulator is the shelter of all living beings. He is their indweller, [related to them] like the sky to the stars. O twice-born, just as a fire laden with tinder sends off many sparks unintentionally, similarly, this transcendental Bhaga- vän sends forth or emits the living beings, who are bound by their previous desires, so that they can become liberated. Thus, know all these [living beings] as integrated parts of Bhagavan and Him, the unborn Bhagavan, as the all-encompassing Whole. (Narada-pañcaratra)56

Therefore, when it is said that Śrī Pradyumna is the indweller of Brahma, Śrī Visnu of Manu, and Śrī Sankarṣaṇa of Rudra, it is to be understood that Bhagavan Śrī Kṛṣṇa alone, having manifested along with His various parts, becomes the [root] indweller of these diverse beings through these [correspond- ing] partial manifestations. For this reason, Rudra is said to have his source (prakṛti) both in Sri Sankarṣana [for the play of cosmic dissolution], as well as in the Purusa [for the play of cos- mic creation] as in [the prose passage from the Fifth Canto]: &ldquo;Śrī Śiva worships his own source, who is known as Śrī Sankarṣaṇa&rdquo; (SB 5.17.16).57 And also, &ldquo;That Primeval Puruşa, united with rajas, appeared in the beginning as Brahma for the creation of this universe, and, united with tamas, He appeared as Rudra for its destruction&rdquo; (SB 11.4.5).58 This is also explained in Visņu Purana:

Therefore, it is concluded that the Puruşa alone is the imma- nent indweller (antaryāmi) of all beings, who is referred to as Paramātmā in the following verse: &ldquo;All those who have real- ized Absolute Reality (tattva), describe this Reality as nondual consciousness (advaya-jñāna).

Śrīdhara Svāmi has also given a similar explanation while com- menting on the prayers of Varuna: &ldquo;I offer obeisance unto Bha- gavan, who is Brahman and Paramātmā&rdquo; (SB 10.28.6).60 Here he says, &ldquo;Paramātmā means the regulator of all living beings.&rdquo;

Commentary
Παραπών
nemau aldaganismi di bulduz el doldw[end]T After demonstrating that there are two kṣetrajñas, i.e., the jiva and Paramātmā, and that Paramātmā is the Supreme Witness, Śrī Jiva Gosvāmi returns to the Gitä verses 13.1-2 to remove any further doubts about this topic. His main objection is to the vivarta theory, which denies the ontological existence of the individual self. Yet, individuality is essential for bhakti-yoga, in which a jiva is under- stood as an eternally distinct conscious entity, but not independent of Bhagavan.
The demonstrative adjective idam (this) in GITA 13.1 indicates proximity, namely that the body is directly perceivable to the kṣetrajña. Although the words sarira (body), kṣetra (field), and kṣetrajña are all used in the singular, this does not mean that there is only one knower of the field in an absolute monistic sense. The singular here represents the whole class. According to Sanskrit
63 eko devo sarva-bhüteşu güḍhaḥ sarva-vyāpī sarva-bhūtāntarātmā o al 99T karmadhyakṣaḥ sarva-bhūtādhivāsaḥ säksi cetaḥ kevalo nirgunas care galbev ajām ekām lohita-sukla-kṛṣṇām bahviḥ prajaḥ sṛjamānāṁ sarūpāḥ

grammar, the singular can also sometimes be used while referring to a group (jati-puraskara, cf66 Hari-nāmāmṛta-vyakarana 4.6) 67
In the statement, &ldquo;Know me also to be the kṣetrajña in all bodies whatsoever,&rdquo; the pronoun &ldquo;Me&rdquo; (mam) indicates that Bhagavan is the kṣetrajña in all bodies, whereas the individual self is the knower only of its own body. This is the difference between the two know- ers of the field. It is, therefore, improper to consider these two purusas or kṣetrajñas as one by use of the principle of bhaga-tyäga- lakṣaṇā (discarding one part of a statement to obtain the correct meaning). A secondary meaning (lakṣaṇārtha) is resorted to only when the primary or direct meaning does not make sense, which is not the case here.alunq
In Bhagavad Gitā (13.2) there is no need to take the word kṣetra- jña to mean the same knower of the field spoken of in the previous verse, thus interpreting the single kṣetrajña to mean the qualityless Brahman. If this were Kṛṣṇa&rsquo;s intention, He would have spoken only the first half of the first line in verse 13.2, i.e., &ldquo;Know the kṣetra- jña to be Me alone,&rdquo; and there would have been no need to add, &ldquo;in all kṣetras, O Bharata.&rdquo; This latter phrase would then serve no pur- pose and would become redundant. Since it has been used, and, assuming that Krsna is not using words unnecessarily, His state- ment clearly identifies two distinct kṣetrajñas, one the individual self and the other Paramātmā. muod
In the concluding verses in the discussion of the kṣetrajña (GĪTĀ 13.21-22), Krsna again speaks of the two purusas or kṣetrajñas as distinct. Because an introductory statement must be confirmed by the conclusion, the verse at the beginning of the chapter (13.1) must again be seen in that light and as referring to two kṣetra- jñas. The principle of an introductory statement (upakrama) being

If it be argued that the effect does not exist in the cause because the Śruti speaks of the world&rsquo;s non-existence (asat) prior to creation, this is not so because concluding statements show that the word Wor [asat] is used instead to denote a difference of characteristics [and Ove not absolute non-existence]. (vs 2.1.17) (eds.);

This sūtra presents an argument based on different statements in the Upanisads that seem to imply that the creation arose out of non-existence, or asat, e.g., &ldquo;In the beginning all this was the unmanifested (asat) alone&rdquo; (TU 2.7.1, CHU 6.2.1). The word asat liter- ally means non-existence, but such a meaning would be inappro- priate because later both these Upanisads say that from this asat arose sat, or existence. This is absurd, because existence cannot arise from non-existence. If that were the case, the cause-effect relation would become meaningless, for anything could arise from anything, or from nothing at all.
The Taittiriya Upanisad (2.7.1) further says in the same mantra, &ldquo;That unmanifested [i.e., Brahman] created Itself by Itself&rdquo; (tad ātmānam svayam akuruta). This is the concluding statement. So, adopting the principle that the introduction must be understood with reference to the conclusion,&rdquo; asat cannot be taken to mean non-existence, since asat is referred to in the latter statement by the pronoun tat (that), &ldquo;which created Itself by Itself.&rdquo; The import of this statement is that the Reality indicated by the pronoun &ldquo;that&rdquo; has potency to manifest, and thus it is not non-existent. If asat meant absolute non-existence, then it could not be referred to by a pronoun. Therefore, asat is interpreted to mean &ldquo;the uncaused cause,&rdquo;
I or in other words, the unmanifested source condition as contrasted with the state in which distinctions of phenomenal name and form become manifested.
Additionally, if it be said that the effect does not exist in the

cause after dissolution because there is a statement that the world is then asat (non-manifest), it is replied that such is not the case, because the word asat there refers to an alternate state of the effect and does not mean absolute non-existence, as can be deduced from the concluding statement. The existence of two kṣetrajñas is also confirmed by Brahma-sutra (1.2.11), &ldquo;The two ātmās who have entered the cavity of the heart are the jiva and Paramātmā, because it is so described in the scriptures.&rdquo; ef nur browed Am
Of the two kṣetrajñas, however, Paramātmā is primary, whereas the jiva is subordinate. The reason for this is that the jiva has but limited knowledge of just one kṣetra and is devoid of immediate knowledge of the other kṣetrajñas, whereas Paramātmā has com- plete knowledge of all kṣetras and kṣetrajñas. Moreover, a jiva is not independent of Paramātmā in its knowing capacity. It is dependent upon Him for its existence and powers. Thus, independently it can- not be called a kṣetrajña. Sage Vaiśampayana, therefore, concludes that only Hari is the kṣetrajña (Mahābhārata, Śānti-parva 348.58)?2 enoParamātmā is a partial manifestation of Bhagavan, as stated by Kṛṣṇa in GĪTĀ 10.42 (ekämsena sthito jagat). The jivas are integrated parts of the energy of Paramātmā, who is the possessor of the jivas that make up Bhagavan&rsquo;s intermediary (taṭastha) potency. Being the Whole of which the jivas are but parts, Paramātmā is the con- troller and they are the controlled. This is a very significant point to be noted and a unique observation on the part of Sri Jiva Gosvāmi. The general opinion is that the jiva is part of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, as He Him- self states in the Gitā (15.7). Jiva Gosvāmī makes it clear, however, that the jiva is within the direct jurisdiction of Paramātmā and not of Bhagavan.
This is confirmed by the prayers of the Vedas personified cited in the text. This understanding also accords with the principle that the conditioning of the jiva is beginningless and that the jiva did not fall into the material creation from Vaikuntha.&rdquo; It is only when a conditioned living being surrenders to Bhagavan that he comes directly under His jurisdiction. Hence, in the following statement
72 harir eva hi kṣetrajño nirmamo niskalas tatham and 73 For details of this see Bhagavat Sandarbha (Anuccheda 63).

I The Ontology of Paramatma - The Supreme Immanent Self
Kṛṣṇa describes the nature of His dealings both as Paramātmā, in relation to the non-devoted, and as Bhagavan, in relation to the devotees: &ldquo;I am equal to all beings. There is no one hateful or dear to Me, but those who worship Me with devotion are in Me and I am also in them&rdquo; (GĪTĀ 9.29)? Being an integrated part of Paramātmā, the jiva is naturally also part of Bhagavan.
98 Just as the word kṣetrajña is used for both the jiva and Param- ātmā, the word puruşa is also used for both of them. The reason for this is that just as a jīva has a material body as his delimiter, likewise Paramātmā has the material energy as His field of action, which is taken figuratively to be His delimiter, though in reality it is not?5&amp;sho
dh After establishing Paramātmā as the root or primary kṣetrajña, Śrī Jiva devotes the rest of the section to the presentation of sup- porting statements from various sources, declaring that Param- ātmā is the same as the Purusa expansion of Bhagavan for the sake of material creation. He also mentions that Paramātmā has differ- ent forms, such as Pradyumna and Sankarṣana. Visnu is also one of the names of Paramātmā. In the next anuccheda, he will go on to explain the three manifestations of the Purusa.

Bhagavan Viṣṇu has three forms, each called the Purusa, orign the Immanent Self. The first, Mahāvisnu, is He who sets in motion the total material energy [mahat-tattva], the second is Garbhodakaśāyi Visņu, who is situated within each egg-like [or womb-like] universe, and the third is Kṣirodakaśāyī Viṣṇu, who is immanent within the heart of every living being. He who intuitively knows these three is liberated from conditional existence?
This will be explained more completely in Anuccheda 101.

It is necessary to explain the word linga [from Brahma-samhi- tā 5.8, cited above]. In accordance with the Vişņu Purāņa state- ment, &ldquo;This entire cosmic energy is situated in a 100,000,000th part of His part&rdquo; (VP 1.9.52), the pronoun &ldquo;His&rdquo; refers to the Supreme form of Bhagavan, Śrī Govinda [and the potency to manifest the puruṣāvatāras belongs to Him alone]. A special part [of that causal potency] of Śrī Govinda is known as Sambhu [Vasudeva or Mahā-Nārāyaṇa], who is called the causal agent (linga), comparable to that causal potency (lingam iva), because He is the agency through which the puruṣāvatāras appear. In other words, the term linga [denoting a portion of Śrī Govinda] is the basis of the primary meaning of the word sambhu. Linga
the Brahma-samhita, where Goloka-Śvetadvipa is described in the form of a yantra (a geometric representational pattern). There, the catur-vyuha, or four direct emanations of Govinda, who is the Lord of Goloka and the adi-purușa, are named as belonging to the &ldquo;envelopment&rdquo; (avaraṇa) of the highest spiritual abode. The second of these four emanations is known as Sankarṣaṇa. So, Nārāyaṇa is the expansion, or portion, of this Sankarsana, and is thus called sankarṣaṇātmaka, i.e., whose Self, Whole, or Source (ātmā) is Sankarṣaṇa alone, sankarṣaṇa eva ātmā yasya saḥ.

The second Puruşa is the indweller (antaryämi) of the aggre- gate of all jivas (samaṣṭi-jiva), as indicated in statements, such as: &ldquo;After creating [the world], He entered into it&rdquo; (TU 2.6.2). Because this form is involved with the universes which are man- ifold, this Puruşa has numerous divisions, among which are sometimes included Pradyumna, who is the indweller of the sub- tle [or psychic] dimension of being, and Aniruddha, who is the indweller of the gross [or physical] dimension of being. From this it can be concluded that the original Sankarṣaṇa and the other supra-cosmic forms [of Vasudeva, Pradyumna, and Ani- ruddha], who are situated in Maha-vaikuntha, are the whole of which these cosmic forms are the parts. Furthermore, the cos- mic forms of Vasudeva, and so on, who are the presiding deities of pure intellection (citta)10 and the other psychic functions, are parts of these original forms.

1 The Ontology of Paramātmā - The Supreme Immanent Self
Commentary
contood
billige untwissem oly nwo sit ni esate radio and IN THE PREVIOUS ANUCCHEDA, it was explained that Bhagavan manifests as Paramātmā to regulate the cosmos and the living beings within it. Paramātmā is the companion of the jiva within the material body. The jiva is an integrated conscious part of Param- ātmā, belonging to His intermediary potency. Śrī Jīva Gosvāmi referred to Krsna&rsquo;s statement in which He says that He is present throughout the cosmos, pervading it through a single portion of Himself as Paramātmā (GĪTĀ 10.42). To explain how as Paramātmā He creates and upholds the cosmos, Śrī Jiva begins this anuccheda.
In Bhagavat Sandarbha (Anucchedas 8-10), it was explained that Bhagavan appears only in response to the bhakti of a devotee. Here Śrī Jiva affirms that bhakti alone is instrumental in the manifesta- tion of Paramātmā also. This will be elaborated in Anuccheda 101. A doubt may be raised. If Paramātmā manifests only for the sake of His devotees, how could the creation proceed, since there would be no devotees prior to creation? The answer is that Paramātmā evolves the cosmos for the sake of those devotees who could not attain the completion stage of devotion in the previous cycle of creation and are lying dormant within the body of Paramātmā (Mahāviṣṇu).
bedrmeab
Bhagavan does not regulate the material energy directly, but does so through His puruṣāvatāras, who are all called Paramātmā. Paramātmā has three manifestations. The first is known by var- ious names, such as Mahāviṣṇu, Kāraṇodakaśāyī Viṣṇu, Sankar- ṣaṇa, Nārāyaṇa, or the first Purusa. He is the regulator of primor- dial nature, called prakṛti or pradhana. He reposes in &ldquo;yogic sleep&rdquo; on the water of the Causal Ocean, or kāraṇārṇava. The Causal Ocean is the boundary between the material and spiritual domains.sh
At the end of a creation cycle, the cosmos is dissolved back into the unmanifest state of matter, prakṛti. At this time, the jīvas along with prakṛti remain in an inactive state within the body of Mahāviṣṇu. When it is time for a new creative cycle to begin, He manifests the universes. The Bṛhad-aranyaka Upanisad (2.1.20) compares this creative process to sparks flying out from a
58

source fire. According to the Brahma-samhita (5.13, 48), Mahāviṣṇu generates innumerable universes from the pores of His body.vlla
In the Brahma-samhita (5.8), Sambhu is referred to as the causal agent of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the original Bhagavan. For this reason, Sambhu is called linga. Etymologically, the word linga means an indicator, lingam artham gamayati, &ldquo;A linga is that which discloses an object or a hidden meaning.&rdquo; For example, in Nyaya smoke is known as the linga for fire because by seeing smoke one can infer the pres- ence of fire. In this sense, smoke can be said to be causal in regard to the inference of fire. Therefore, linga means &ldquo;an indicator, sym- bol, or cause.&rdquo; An indicator, or symbol, informs us of something that is not explicit, while a cause suggests a hidden potency to bring forth an effect. In this sense, the word linga can also mean &ldquo;genera- tive organ.&rdquo; It is in the sense of causal agency that the word linga has been used here. Thus, Sambhu is the linga of Kṛṣṇa in both senses He is His causal agent in the matter of creation, and He also indicates the existence of His source, Śrī Kṛṣṇa.
darow
The word linga can also mean a male organ because the latter is instrumental in procreation. This meaning, however, is inap- propriate here. This is clear from Jiva&rsquo;s comment - lingam iva lingam, &ldquo;[Sambhu] is known as linga (the causal agent), compara- ble to that causal potency (lingam iva) [which manifests the puru- şavatāras].&rdquo; In the same way, the word yoni (commonly, &ldquo;womb&rdquo;) does not mean the female organ but refers instead to pradhana, as in GĪTĀ 14.3, &ldquo;The total material substance, called Brahman [i.e., pradhana] is My own womb [into which I sow the seed of living beings]&rdquo; (mama yonir mahad brahma). Kṛṣṇa embodies the male principle and so does not have a yoni in the conventional sense. The words linga and yoni both signify a cause or source. This kind of usage is known as parokṣavāda, or indirect expression. This is the meaning behind the worship of Śiva and Parvati in the form of linga and yoni in Hindu temples. There is no vulgarity involved in it.
From Śrī Jiva Gosvāmi&rsquo;s comment, it is concluded that the word Sambhu also denotes the source of Mahāviṣņu. In fact, he remarks that the primary meaning of the word sambhu is &ldquo;a special part of
59
59
1 The Ontology of Paramātmā - The Supreme Immanent Self
Mahā-bhagavan Śrī Govinda,&rdquo; and not Bhagavan Siva. Etymologi- cally, sambhu means, &ldquo;He from whom sam - meaning liberation or bhakti- ensues.&ldquo;14 The word sama is used in the sense of bhakti in the Bhāgavatam: &ldquo;Sama is the state of the wisdom faculty (buddhi) when it is exclusively fixed on Me [Śrī Kṛṣṇa]&rdquo; (samo man-nisthată buddheḥ, SB 11.19.36). The Visiṣtadvaita-kośa (p. 48, Part 9) glosses the word sambhu as &ldquo;Nārāyaṇa, who is the source of the cosmos and the bestower of liberation.&ldquo;15 This very Śambhu is called Maheś- vara and Puruşa (Brahma-samhita 5.10). It is from Him that the first Paramātmā, called Mahāviṣṇu, manifests.
To understand the subject of Bhagavan&rsquo;s integral self-expan- sions, we have to keep in mind that there are two categories of quadruple manifestations (catur-vyuha). The first one manifests directly from Śrī Kṛṣṇa and consists of Vasudeva, Sankarṣaṇa (Baladeva), Pradyumna, and Aniruddha. These four are supra- cosmic forms, being situated within the spiritual domain, and are worshipable for the devotees. The second catur-vyuha is present within the cosmos and is known by the same name. It manifests from Sankarṣana of the first quadruple manifestation. This cosmic catur-vyuha exists for the purpose of the creation, sustenance, and dissolution of the cosmos.
16
The concept of vyuha is found in the Mahabharata. Catur-vyuha is one of the thousand names of Viṣṇu (Mahabharata, Anusāsana- parva 248.28). While commenting on this name, Sankarācārya cites a verse stating that Bhagavan expands in four forms, begin- ning with Vasudeva, for the purpose of creation, and so on.1 Baladeva Vidyabhuṣaṇa also comments that Bhagavan is known to be of four forms in which He manifests the six types of majesties, some collectively and some individually, for the purpose of cre- ation, and so on.&rdquo; The vyuha manifestations are mentioned by the sage Vaiśampayana, &ldquo;The onefold Absolute is sometimes described

2 The First Puruşa as Disclosed in Bhagavata Puraṇa
as twofold, elsewhere as threefold, and in other places still as fourfold (catur-vyuha)&rdquo; (Mahabharata, Santi-parva 348.57)8
From this it is understood that Kṛṣṇa expands in four forms for the benefit of His devotees and for the purpose of cosmic creation, sustenance, protection, and dissolution. There are three potencies required for creation, namely, will, cognition, and action. The first potency has its source primarily within Kṛṣṇa. He being the Sup- reme Regulator (Brahma-samhita 5.1), nothing can happen without His will. The cognitive potency is primarily rooted in Vasudeva, the deity of citta. Sankarṣaṇa predominantly embodies the potency of action, being the deity of ahankara. Therefore, creation occurs through the agency of Sankarṣana, or Mahaviṣṇu, the first Purușa. Sambhu is another name for Vasudeva, also called Nārāyaṇa, and Śrī Sūta calls Him Para, the Supreme (SB 2.6.41). This is understood from the words of sage Drumila:
er

His
man mi gnied gaivil Isubivibai dons To When Nārāyaṇa, the primeval Bhagavan, evolved the cosmos as a body, generating it out of the five elements manifested by His own potency, and then entered into it through His own integrated portion, He attained the name Purusa. (SB 11.4.3) 19
Jasti
He who is referred to in this verse as Purusa is again called Närä- yana in the Brahma-samhita (5.12), cited by Jiva Gosvāmi. From all this it is concluded that Sambhu is an intermediary between Kṛṣṇa and Mahāviṣṇu. Popularly the word also refers to Śiva. The reason for this is that Durga is the deity of the material energy, and her husband is Śiva or Sambhu. Mahaviṣṇu does not contact the mate- rial energy directly but does so through His conduit in the form of Śiva. Thus, Śiva, or Sambhu, becomes the causal agent, or linga, for Mahāviṣṇu. This is understood from Brahma-samhita (see Anucche- das 5, 15, and 45). Thus, it is understood that there are two Śambhus, one is Nārāyaṇa Himself and the other is Śiva.

body, Mahāviṣṇu then enters into each one of them as the second Puruşa (Brahma-samhita 5.14). This second manifestation is called Garbhodakaśāyi Vişņu. He lies down on the Garbhodaka Ocean at the bottom of each universe. He is the regulator and Paramātmā of the individuated universe. There are thus as many Garbhodakaśāyi Visņus as there are universes. Brahma takes birth at the top of a lotus flower that sprouts from Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu&rsquo;s lotus navel (Brahma-samhita 5.22; SB 1.3.2). A doubt may be raised here. In Mahabharata (Santi-parva 340.31) it is stated that Brahma was born from Aniruddha, i.e., the third Purușa. Śrī Baladeva Vidyabhu- ṣaṇa in his commentary on Laghu-bhāgavatamṛta (1.1.9) writes that this statement has been made by considering Aniruddha as nondifferent from Pradyumna, the second Purusa.
Garbhodakaśāyi Visnu then expands Himself as the third mani- festation, or Purușa, called Kṣirodakaśāyī Viṣņu, the Paramātmā for each individual living being in the universe. The appellations Paramātmā or Antaryāmī are more generally used to refer to this Purusa form.
The three Purusa expansions are considered to be partial man- ifestations of Sankarṣaṇa, Pradyumna, and Aniruddha, respec- tively. Within an individual universe, Pradyumna becomes the cause of creation by entering Brahma, who has four heads; Sankar- sana becomes the cause of dissolution by entering Rudra; and Ani- ruddha, who is Visnu Himself, personally oversees the sustenance of the cosmos. The presiding deities of citta, ahankara, buddhi, and manas are also called Vasudeva, Sankarṣaṇa, Pradyumna, and Ani- ruddha, respectively. They are the cosmic partial manifestations of the quadruple forms of the spiritual world. In the next section, Śrī Jiva will specify the second Purușa as found in Śrimad Bhagavatam.

Commentary
Purusa
to this
THE DESCRIPTION given in the verses cited from the Bhagavata Purana is of Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu, who lies at the bottom of the universe. After creating the universe, He enters it and fills half of it with water from His body, and then lies on it. He is the Paramātmā of the individual universe, its regulator.
In each universe there is a corresponding creator-god (or archi- tect) known as Brahma, who is born at the top of a lotus flower sprouted from the navel of Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu. In the Second Canto account, from which this report is taken, Brahma saw dark- ness all around and unsuccessfully tried to find the source of the lotus. Then he heard the instruction to engage in penance. Bhaga- van was pleased with him and revealed to him His form. The verses cited in this section describe Brahma&rsquo;s experience on seeing Bha- gavan. In verse SB 2.9.8 it is said that Brahma meditated for a thou- sand years. Śrī Jiva comments in Krama-sandarbha that the discrep- ancy in the durations of time is due to a difference in kalpas, i.e.,

4 The Third Puruşa as Disclosed in Bhagavata Purāņa
Commentary
कथान
PARAMĀTMĀ IS SITUATED in every living being&rsquo;s heart. The size of Paramātmā is stated as being that of a pradeśa, which is defined in lexicons as being the length from the tip of the thumb to that of the forefinger. A doubt may be raised here: The size of the heart varies from one species to another. There are many species that are themselves smaller than a pradeśa in size. Some have a heart that is smaller, while others may have one much bigger than a prādeśa. Then why is the measure of Paramātmā described as the size of a prādeśa?ntary
This is answered in the Brahma-sutra (1.3.25), which says that the measure of Paramātmā is in reference to human beings and not to other species of life, since the scriptures are intended for humans alone, and not for animals. It is only humans who can meditate; thus the size of a pradeśa is relative to the human heart.
Another doubt is raised: In the Katha Upanisad, Paramātmā, residing in the body, is said to be the size of a thumb, angustha- matraḥ puruso madhya ätmani tiṣṭhati (KU 2.1.12). The size of a thumb is much less than a pradeśa. How can we reconcile these two descriptions? The answer is that Paramātmā is neither the size of a pradeśa nor that of a thumb, but appears according to the intention of the meditator. He does not have a fixed size, because whether He is the size of a thumb or a pradeśa, His dimension will still vary from person to person and species to species. Therefore, He takes the size desired by His devotee. This is confirmed by Brahma in his prayers (SB 3.9.11) to Paramātmā, whom he saw after a hundred years of meditation, as described in the previous section.

Commentary
(88182102-0TH) TESLA
IN THE PREVIOUS THREE ANUCCHEDAS, three distinct forms of Paramātmā have been explained. The third Paramātmā exists in the heart of each living being. In this regard, the following question arises: Are there many Paramātmās or only one? Śri Jiva Gosvāmī replies that there is only one Paramātmā. In fact, the tattva, or the Absolute Reality, can be only one. This is the fundamental teaching of Bhāgavata Purāṇa.
sda vd blotinamas bavisose of
The vital air (prāna) is one, but it functions and regulates each living being separately. We all survive on vital air, and, according to Ayurveda, all our bodily functions are dependent on it. The var- ious movements of the bodily parts, such as hands and feet, eye- lids, and jaws, depend on the life airs. Any disturbance in them will create some malfunction in the body. Yet, the air is ultimately one. Similarly, the air enters different houses and takes the shape of that house (prati-rupa), and thus it appears in as many shapes as there are houses, yet it is only one. In the same way, Paramātmā, who is undifferentiated and all-pervading, appears in all beings while remaining as one.

One Paramātmā Is Present in All Bodies by
७ । एवम् (भा० ११।१८।३२) -
BHAGAVAN ŚRI KRṢNA instructed Uddhava in a similar manner:
एक एव परो ह्यात्मा भूतेष्वात्मन्यवस्थितः । यथेन्दुरुदपात्रेषु भूतान्येकात्मकानि च ॥ ४२ ॥
Just as the moon [although one] is reflected in numerous pots filled with water, similarly one Supreme Self alone is present as the Self (ätmani) interior to all living beings, and the bodies too are of one essence. (SB 11.18.32)1
भूतेषु जीवेषु एक एव पर आत्मा न त्वसौ जीववत् तत्र तत्र लिप्तो भवति इत्याह- आत्मनि स्वस्वरूप एव अवस्थितः । भूतानि जीवदेहा अपि येन कारणरूपेणैकात्मका- नीति ॥ श्रीभगवानुद्भवम् ॥
no the
There is only one Supreme Self, Paramātmā, interior to all liv- ing beings (bhüteşu), i.e., the jivas. He is not implicated in these bodies like the living entities. To assure us of this, Kṛṣṇa says here: &ldquo;[Paramātmā is present] as the Self&rdquo; (ätmani), meaning that He is situated exclusively in His own svarupa, or intrinsic being. The word bhūtāni here refers to the bodies of the jivas. These too have a single essence due to having Him alone as their
common cause.

There is a distinct jīva present in each different body, whereas Paramātmā is one only. This appears contradictory and thus requires explanation. It is illustrated here through the exam- ple of one moon reflecting in many pots full of clear water. In such a case, the moon appears as many, though it is but one. The dissim- ilarity in this example is that Paramātmā does not merely reflect Himself in the world, but is actually present with all His poten- cies interior to each living being, while maintaining His singular identity.
Vanharam

A better example to illustrate Paramātmā&rsquo;s inseparable unity is that of the empty space enclosed in different pots. Although the space in each pot appears distinct due to the demarcation created by the pots, it is essentially one single space. On the other hand, the example of the moon reflected in water pots has the advantage that it depicts or implies Paramatma&rsquo;s complete presence in each living being. On this point, the example of demarcated space is weaker, because in the analogy it is only a portion of all-pervading space that is enclosed in a particular pot. Moreover, the moon has individuality, unlike space, so on this point, too, it serves as a fit- ting basis of comparison with the Self. It is appropriate, therefore, that Kṛṣṇa offers the example of the reflection of the moon as a metaphor for the Self.
Next, Śrī Jiva Gosvāmī will describe Paramätma&rsquo;s conscious portions, which are of two categories - selfsame and differenti- ated. All Vedāntis accept that there is but one Absolute Reality. This is the feature of Vedanta that distinguishes it from other Vedic philosophical schools, such as Nyaya, Sankhya, and so on. The Gordian knot for the Vedanta philosophy is to accommodate a multiplicity of conscious beings and empirical variety within the one indivisible Reality. Sankara cuts this knot by not assigning any ontological reality to empirical existence. This radical, yet ultimately constricted, approach is not appreciated by Vaiṣṇava
73I The Ontology of Paramātmā - The Supreme Immanent Self
Vedanta, because it belittles the transcendental identity of Bhaga- vän and the value of devotion to Him. For Vaiṣṇava Vedantis, the world is real, being a manifestation of Bhagavan&rsquo;s real energy. The one Bhagavan manifests His energies in various ways. HDOORTJA
One of the important topics that is dealt with at length later in Paramätma Sandarbha is how the empirical world manifests from the potency of Paramātmā. Before treating this topic, Śrī Jiva first establishes that Paramātmā is the unconditional cause and support of the cosmos as the Immanent Self. Having done so, he begins to explain the two main categories of Paramatma&rsquo;s expansions - as avatāras and as jīvas. Śrī Jīva describes the avataras of Paramātmā up to Anuccheda 18 and then begins a lengthy discussion of the jiva that continues until Anuccheda 47.
Avataras are of various types, such as līlāvatāras and guṇāva- tāras. The former will be described in Krsna Sandarbha (Anucche- das 6-26). Here Śrī Jiva is particularly interested in describing the guṇāvatāras because they are directly related to the creation, sustenance, and dissolution of the cosmos, which come under the jurisdiction of Paramātmā. al spega be

It will be described that the vibhinnäṁśas are the liv- ing beings, the jivas, who are of the nature of the intermedi- ary potency (taṭastha-śakti) [or in other words, the potency sit- uated on the dividing line of, and mediating between, the intrin- sic and extrinsic potencies of Bhagavan]. The sväṁsas are of various types with divisions of guṇāvatāra, lilāvatāra, and so on. Of these, the lilavatāras and others will be described in Śrī Kṛṣṇa Sandarbha (Anucchedas 6-26), due to the relevance of the context there. remeto ye

1 The Ontology of Paramātmā - The Supreme Immanent Self
That primeval Puruşa, united with rajas, appeared in the begin- ning as Brahma for the creation of this universe; for its suste- nance He appeared as Bhagavan Viṣṇu, the Lord of consecrated action (kratu-pati) and the protector of dharma and of the twice- born; endowed with tamas, He appeared as Rudra for its destruc- tion. This is how the creation, preservation, and destruction of the generations regularly proceed. (SB 11.4.5)1

That primeval (adya) Puruşa simultaneously presides over the three gunas of nature. Even so, it is simply out of the transcen- dental play (lilä) of presiding over the various gunas individ- ually that He also became Brahma in the beginning, for the creation of the universe, which here means for the secondary creation (visarga), enacted through the guna of rajas.

For the sustenance of the universe, the Puruşa became Viṣṇu. &ldquo;Through the guna of sattva&rdquo; is to be added after the word vişnu [to complete the intended sense]. In this verse, however, there is no explicit mention of sattva because Bhagavan&rsquo;s original nature in the Visņu form is not eclipsed while carrying out the act of sustenance, and thus it would have been improper to express even figuratively a relation with sattva-guna. 100 903 to Sansvaler adt of sub (as-a an

counted among the lilavatāras by Brahma in the Second Canto (SB 2.7.11). Visnu is [also] the bridge (setu) [to cross over to the final destination], meaning [He is] the protector of [both] the twice-born and of religious integrity (dharma).

For the destruction of the universe through tamas, He became Rudra. In this way, creation, sustenance, and dissolution occur. The occasions of the descents of Brahma and Rudra are ascertained in the Mokṣa-dharma:

odno Vidura, Bhagavan Visnu Himself entered that lotus, which on sencompasses all the worlds, in which all the qualities (gunas) e) ad were apparent. Then the creator Brahma, the personification of the Vedas - whom they call self-born - appeared on that lotus. (SB 3.8.15)3

The explanation of this verse is as follows: That lotus encom- passes all the worlds, and it brings to light all the qualities (gunas), by which is meant the objects to be experienced by the living beings. The Puruşa, called Śrī Nārāyaṇa, from whom this universe was born, took the appellation of Visnu and entered the lotus as the Immanent Self (antaryāmi, i.e., Paramātmā) who is the maintainer. The prefix pra [indicating prominence] added to the root √vis (&ldquo;to enter&rdquo;) means that He entered in an eminent manner, namely, without losing or diminishing any of His powers. The causative form (nic) of √vis [in the verb prāvī- visat] does not alter the simple meaning of the root, &ldquo;to enter.&rdquo; When the lotus had achieved stable existence because of Bhaga- van Viṣṇu, then He Himself next became Brahma for the sake of creation, because only when clay is present can clay pots be manufactured. Therefore, elsewhere it is also said: &ldquo;The one sup- reme Puruşa takes the names of Hari (Viṣņu), Viriñci (Brahmā), and Hara (Śiva) for the purpose of sustenance, creation, and dissolution&rdquo; (SB 1.2.23).

Commentary hadhivalil.bne Dorney A
THERE IS ONLY one Absolute Reality that manifests in different forms. He Himself manifests both as the regulator and the regu- lated. His manifestation as the regulator is called svāṁśa (lit., a portion that is He Himself, sva eva aṁśaḥ). As the regulated, He is called vibhinnāṁśa (lit., a differentiated portion), or the jiva. A svāṁśa, as the name suggests, does not have the sense or egoism of separate existence or identity. A vibhinnāmsa, however, has the self-concept of existing separate from its source. The true purpose of this separate self-concept is to enable the possibility of love for the svämśa. But the jiva who is overcome with desire to enjoy inde- pendent of the svämśa remains conditioned by maya and unaware of the svāṁśa.
There are two domains of being, spiritual and material. In both of these realms, there are various lokas, or spheres of existence. Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the original form of Bhagavan, and He exists in three aspects in the spiritual lokas called Vaikunthas. According to Laghu- bhāgavatamṛta (1.1.11-17), these aspects are called svayam-rupa (His own original form), tad-ekātma-rupa (forms that are one in essence with His original form), and aveśa (empowered forms). ne riguori
The first category refers to Śrī Kṛṣṇa as He is in His own orig- inal form. The second category refers to forms having the same essential nature as Krsna but differing in appearance. This cat- egory has two divisions called vilasa (forms differing in appear- ance for the sake of distinct play) and svärśa (selfsame portions). Vilasa forms have almost the same potencies as Kṛṣṇa, whereas the svāṁśa forms have a little less power. Examples of the first are Nārāyaṇa and Vasudeva in Vaikuntha. Examples of the second include Matsya, Kurma, and so on, as well as the manifestations of the Purusa or Paramātmā. When a particular jiva is empow- ered with a specific potency of Bhagavan, he is called an aveśa manifestation. Seşa and Narada in Vaikuntha are examples of this.
When Bhagavan appears within the cosmos, which is a manifes- tation of the extrinsic energy, He is called an avatara. According to Laghu-bhāgavatamṛta (1.2.3) there are three categories of avataras:
81
I The Ontology of Paramātmā - The Supreme Immanent Self
puruṣāvatāra, guṇāvatāra, and lilavatāra. The lilāvatāras will be described in Śrī Kṛṣṇa Sandarbha as per their appropriate context. In philosophical writing in particular, topics that are raised for dis- cussion should be related to and consistent with what comes before and after in the exposition. This is called sangati, or context, and is of various types. Prasanga-sangati, mentioned by Śrī Jīva, refers to the context of the relevant subject matter.)
There are three puruṣāvatāras, as described in the previous anucchedas. Guṇāvatāras are also three in number, as found here in this anuccheda. Bhagavata Purana (11.4.5) describes how the Primeval Purușa accepts three forms to enact the functions of creation, sustenance, and dissolution.orw
916Śrī Jiva observes that it is not explicitly stated in the verse either that Visņu accepted sattva-guna for the purpose of suste- nance or that He sustains the cosmos through sattva. In the case of Brahma and Rudra, however, it is mentioned that they accepted the respective gunas of rajas and tamas to perform their functions. Śrī Jiva draws the conclusion that this phrasing is meant to show that Visnu is transcendental to all three gunas, even though He is the support for the function of sustenance, which is carried out through sattva. It would have been improper to state even figura- tively that Visnu is related to material sattva. There is but one self- existent Bhagavan, and He manifests as Brahma, Visņu, and Śiva. Visņu, however, remains transcendental to the gunas of prakṛti despite His apparent involvement with that material function.
In Bhagavat Sandarbha (Anuccheda 47), Śrī Jiva comments that Visnu is visśuddha-sattva (lit., pure sattva), or transcenden- tal &ldquo;being-existence,&rdquo; which is completely distinct from material sattva, or phenomenal being. He enables the function of suste- nance by energizing material sattva merely through His proximity and not by physically contacting it. Although He is counted among the guṇāvatāras, He is not in actual contact with the gunas. w boo
Visnu is also called kratu-pati because He awards the results of kratus (consecrated actions). Kratu is another word for yajña (sacramental offering), and thus kratu-pati means the master or Lord of kratu, or yajña. There is also an avatara called Yajña, so
82
The Puruga 8 Introduction to the Guṇāvatāras
lest one confuse the two, Śrī Jiva comments that they are not iden- tical. As Yajña, He is counted among the lilävatāras, as described in Bhāgavata Purana (2.7.11), while as kratu-pati Visņu, He is a guṇāva- tāra. He is called dvija-dharma-setu (lit., a bridge for the twice-born and dharma). The word setu (bridge) implies that He is the sup- port of dharma and He who carries the twice-born across to their final destination, acting like a bridge over the ocean of material existence. Tell 91 to 100
The verses from Mahabharata are spoken by Śrī Kṛṣṇa to Arjuna, in response to the latter&rsquo;s query about the meaning of Kṛṣṇa&rsquo;s names. The form of Bhagavan mentioned here is Aniruddha. This should be taken to mean Pradyumna, since it is known that Brahma takes birth from Pradyumna.
The Bhāgavatam verse from the Third Canto specifically men- tions that Visnu entered the lotus of the cosmos and gave it sta- bility. This is the function of Visņu, the deity of sattva. Without His presence, nothing would exist. The word sattva thus literally means &ldquo;beingness.&rdquo;

SIMILARLY, Brahma prayed to Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu: &ldquo;Obei- sances to Bhagavan, who manifests Himself as the tree of the worlds. Though [this tree is] one, after separating out from its root in His own Self, it grew into three trunks (tri-pāt) &ndash; myself [Brahma], Bhagavan Viṣṇu, and Śiva- for the sake of the creation, sustenance, and dissolution [of the universe], and thereafter expanded into numerous boughs and branches&rdquo; (SB 3.9.16).

comments
In this verse, the word tri-pat is explained by Śrīdhara Svāmi [in the following paraphrase]: &ldquo;That very same one [tree] is tri-pāt, having three feet, divisions, or trunks in the form of Brahma, Visņu, and Śiva.&rdquo; Because Bhagavan is being described through the metaphor of a tree, these three are identified as trunks [although the word pada in tri-pät literally means &ldquo;feet&rdquo;].

9 The Purusa Is the Root of the Three Trunks of the Universal Tree
Commentary
IN THIS VERSE, the root would be Garbhodakaśāyi Viṣṇu, the sec- ond puruşăvatāra, and the Visņu who is counted among the three trunks would be Kṣirodakaśāyī Viṣņu, the third puruṣāvatāra. The word tri-pat literally means three feet, but Śrīdhara Svāmi glosses it as three trunks. This explanation is given to accord with the metaphor of a tree. The word pät or pada can also mean a divi- sion, and thus it is not wrong to interpret it as a trunk. In Bhagavad Gitā (15.1), the cosmos is described as having roots up and branches down. The reason for this is to show that the source of the cosmos is of a subtle nature and situated beyond it. Here the metaphor of a tree is employed to indicate that the three guṇāvatāras are rooted in the second Purusa.

s2110 The Gunavatāras Appear to Bless the Sage Atril
Commentary old girl loosellow Ichstam sales orfw aseam qu bezaubaib ad lliw oigor air amoque mid slam on asob vs
THIS VERSE IS FOUND in the following context. Atri is one of the sons of Brahma. Being ordered by Brahma to create progeny, Atri went to Ṛkṣa Mountain to engage in penance along with his wife Anasuya. He controlled his mind through pranayama and tolerated the heat and cold for an entire century while standing on one foot. In the course of doing so, he held the following thought in his mind, &ldquo;I seek refuge of Him who is the Supreme Regulator of the universe. May He bless me with offspring like unto Himself&rdquo; (SB 4.1.20)?
Atri did not pray to any specific god by name, and so all three guṇāvatāras, being overlords (prabhu) of the universe- or reg- ulators of one of the functions of creation, sustenance, or disso- lution - appeared before him. When they did so, Atri inquired, &ldquo;My intention was that the one supreme ruler of the universe may appear to me, but there are three of you. Which of you then is the one I was invoking&rdquo; (SB 4.1.27-28)? The gods laughed and answered, &ldquo;The three of us taken together represent the truth on which you contemplated.&rdquo; Subsequently, all three took partial incarnations as Atri&rsquo;s sons: Soma, the moon god, was a portion of Brahma, Dattatreya of Viṣņu, and Durvasa of Śiva.
After describing the three gunävatāras of the Purusa and their functions according to the three gunas of prakṛti, Śrī Jiva intends to show that Bhagavan Vişņu encompasses and exceeds the other two and is transcendental to prakṛti. These three are popularly called the &ldquo;Hindu Trinity,&rdquo; and the general feeling among most Hindus is that there is no difference between Viṣṇu and Śiva. In fact, judg- ing by the sheer number of Śiva temples in India, he seems to be the more popular deity of the two among the masses. One or more Śiva- lingas can be seen in almost every village of India. Śiva is called Asu- toșa, &ldquo;one who is easily pleased,&rdquo; and this perhaps indicates the rea- son for his popularity. Bhagavata Purana itself confirms that Śiva&rsquo;s devotees are opulent (SB 10.88.1), so there is little wonder that the

IN THIS SECTION, Śrī Jiva begins to stress the supremacy of Vişnu over Brahma and Śiva, referring to an anecdote from Bhāgavata Purāņa (10.89), incidentally pointing out that Visnu&rsquo;s abode is in the Milk Ocean. The story goes that once there was a big confer- ence of sages on the bank of the river Sarasvati. A question came upon the assembly as to which of the three gods - Brahmā, Viṣṇu, or Śiva - is paramount. The sage Bhrgu was assigned to ascertain
the truth.

Bhrgu first went to visit Brahma, his father. To test Brahma&rsquo;s forbearance, he neither paid the customary respect nor did he praise him. Brahma became furious and glared at Bhrgu with eyes rolling in anger. But since the insult had been inflicted by his own son, he contained his rage.
Bhrgu next went to Kailasa, the residence of his elder brother, Śiva. Seeing his brother approaching, Śiva rose up from his seat and proceeded to embrace the sage. But Bhrgu avoided Śiva, say- ing, &ldquo;I shall not touch you, because you have disregarded social con- vention and flouted the injunctions of the Vedas by putting skulls

edition of Śrī Haridasa Săstri. Being a connecting statement, it both concludes the discussion in Anuccheda 11 and serves as a bridge for the statement that follows in Anuccheda 12. This is readily perceived in the Sanskrit text in which the flow of thought proceeds uninterrupted by translation and commentary. We have moved the statement here so as not to lose its primary sense of bringing a conclusion to the discussion in Anuccheda 11. In addition, we have placed a square bracket at the beginning of the translation to Anuccheda 12 that supplies the statement&rsquo;s linking function to the ongoing discussion. defin

But Pārvati fell at his feet, pacifying him and persuading him not to commit the ghastly deed of killing his own brother.gallo asmen brsewody sno entsinos base
Bhrgu then moved on to Vaikuntha, the abode of Bhagavan Viṣṇu. There he observed that Bhagavan was lying down with His head in the lap of Lakṣmi Devi. The sage walked up to Visņu and kicked Him in the chest. Visnu immediately got up and reverently spoke the following words, &ldquo;O sage, please come and have a seat. I was unaware of your arrival, so I did not welcome you properly. Please forgive Me. Your feet are so soft and My chest so very hard. You must surely be feeling some pain after kicking Me.&rdquo; Saying this, Visnu began to massage Bhrgu&rsquo;s feet. He continued, &ldquo;O sage, all My sins have been dispelled by the touch of your feet. From this day I have become the sole abode of Lakṣmi, the Goddess of Wealth. She will henceforth dwell on My bosom bearing the mark of your foot.&rdquo; of 15340 HASANGAN

ad Sage Bhrgu felt great joy on hearing this expression of humil- ity from Visņu. His voice choked up out of devotion and tears fell from his eyes. He could not utter a single word. He returned to the assembly of sages and narrated what he had experienced. Hearing his words, everyone was struck with wonder and had no doubt about the supremacy of Bhagavan Visņu, the reservoir of all virtuous qualities. giderowo
Although the Bhāgavatam relates that Bhrgu went to Vaikuntha to see Visņu, Śrī Jiva Prabhu points out here that in fact, this would be the guṇāvatāra form of Viṣṇu who lies on the Ocean of Milk, which is within the cosmos. In Bhagavat Sandarbha (Anucchedas 73 and 74), Jiva explains that just as Bhagavan appears as an avatara in the material world, so too His eternal abode manifests within the cosmos. A reference to such an appearance is found in the Eighth Canto of the Bhāgavatam (8.5.4-5).
The third Purusa of Visnu is called both Kṣirodakaśāyi Viṣṇu as well as Aniruddha. He is called Kṣirodakaśāyī because He resides upon the Ocean of Milk, kṣirodaka. He is also called Aniruddha

because sometimes Bhagavan Aniruddha, the fourth member of the quadruple manifestation of Kṛṣṇa, personally takes the place of Kṣirodakaśāyi Visnu. llal Dave 8 anshin ald thw ugula air The Brhat-sahasra-nama mentioned here is spoken by Śiva to Parvati and contains one thousand names of Viṣṇu. One of Visnu&rsquo;s names found there is Kṣīrābdhi-mandira (Padma Purana, Uttara- khanda 71.141), or one who resides upon the Milk Ocean. In the Uttara-khanda of Padma Purana (Chapter 245) there is a description of the devas headed by Brahma approaching the northern beach of the Milk Ocean to supplicate Bhagavan Visņu.galwollol at sloga
Śvetadvipa (&ldquo;the white island&rdquo;) is another name for this abode of Visņu. It is mentioned in Brahma-samhita: &ldquo;I worship Svetad- vipa, called Goloka&rdquo; (Brahma-samhita 5.66) Svetadvipa and its res- idents are described in great detail in the Nārāyaṇīya section of the Mahabharata (starting from Santi-parva, Chapter 335), which
relates Nārada&rsquo;s visit there.
It may be mentioned here that in some Purāņas, stories, such as this one, may be related in a different manner in order to prove the supremacy of Śiva or another deity. The reason for this is that the Purānas are divided into three groups according to the three gunas. The sättvika Puranas are superior to the other two categories because true knowledge comes from sattva - sattvät sañjāyate jñānam (GĪTĀ 14.17). This was discussed in Anuccheda 18 of Tattva Sandarbha. Moreover, Śrī Kṛṣṇa says that He establishes a devotee&rsquo;s faith in whatever deity he is drawn to worship (GITA 7.21-23). This is accomplished through the stories found in non-sättvika Purāņas. In Tattva Sandarbha, Śrī Jīva established the supreme authority of Bhāgavata Purana over all other Purānas and Itihāsas in the matter of the self-disclosure of Ultimate Reality. Thus, the conclusion of Bhāgavata Purāṇa overrides any contradictory description.sybas

931 The Ontology of Paramātmā - The Supreme Immanent Self
Here, although the one transcendental Purușa, for the sake of sustenance, creation, and dissolution of this universe, is con- nected separately with each of the three gunas as their presiding deities, He still remains transcendental and untouched by them. He takes the separate appellations of Hari, Viriñci, and Hara, meaning that Bhagavan appears in the forms [of these three deities]. Nevertheless, of these three, it is from Śrī Visņu alone, who presides over the power of sattva, that the true benefits [of human life (śreyamsi)], namely, the auspicious fruits called dharma, artha, kāma, mokṣa, and bhakti, are to be obtained.
अयं भावः– उपाधिदृष्ट्या तौ द्वौ सेवमाने रजस्तमसोर्घोरमूढत्वात् भवन्तोऽपि धर्मा- र्थकामा नातिसुखदा भवन्ति तथोपाधित्यागेन सेवमाने भवन्नपि मोक्षो न साक्षान् न च झटिति किन्तु कथमपि परमात्मांश एवायमित्यनुसन्धानाभ्यासेनैव परमात्मन एव भवति । तत्र तत्र साक्षात् परमात्माकारेणाप्रकाशात् तस्मात् ताभ्यां श्रेयांसि न भवन्ति ।
The sense is this: If Brahma and Śiva are worshiped as limited with adjuncts [i.e., as devas in charge of their respective gunas], then because rajas and tamas are distressful and bewildering [respectively], even if one should attain the fruits of dharma, artha, and kāma [through them], they will not be very pleasing. If [on the other hand] one worships these two as without any adjuncts [taking them as identical to the Supreme and free of any guna], then even if mokṣa were to occur, it would neither come directly from them nor be realized swiftly. Rather, only if they are worshiped in the constant understanding that they are both parts of Paramātmā [i.e., that they are avataras of Param- ātmā], is liberation to be obtained, and only from Paramātmā alone. [But] since Paramātmā is not directly manifest in the forms of Śiva or Brahma, the ultimate welfare does not proceed directly from them.
अथोपाधिदृष्ट्यापि श्रीविष्णुं सेवमाने सत्त्वस्य शान्तत्वात् धर्मार्थकामा अपि सुखदाः । तत्र निष्कामत्वेन तु तं सेवमाने “सत्त्वात् सञ्जायते ज्ञानम्&rdquo; (गीता १४ । १७ ) इति । “कैवल्यं सात्त्विकं ज्ञानम्” (भा० ११ । २५।२४) इति चोक्तेर्मोक्षस्य साक्षात् ।

Now, [on the other hand,] if one serves Bhagavan Viṣṇu, even considering Him to be delimited by sattva [i.e., not knowing

36

Him as the Supreme], the dharma, artha, and kama achieved [through Him] will be pleasing, because sattva is peaceful by nature. And if one serves Him without material desire [even while still considering Him to be delimited by sattva], then one attains mokṣa directly, in accordance with statements like, &ldquo;Knowledge manifests from sattva&rdquo; (GITA 14.17)2 and &ldquo;Kaivalya (liberation) is sättvika knowledge&rdquo; (SB 11.25.24).

Therefore, it is said in the Skanda Purāna:
How

He who binds with the ropes of material existence and He who delivers from the same bondage is Bhagavan Viṣṇu alone, Be the eternal Absolute Reality and the bestower of liberation
(kaivalya). (Skanda Purana)</em>
उपाधिपरित्यागेन तु पञ्चमपुरुषार्थो भक्तिरेव भवति तस्य परमात्माकारेणैव प्रकाशात् । तस्मात् श्रीविष्णोरेव श्रेयांसि स्युरिति ।
If, however, one worships Bhagavan Viṣṇu without any limit- ing adjuncts [considering Him Supreme], then it is bhakti alone that is attained, the fifth goal of human life, because He [Vişnu without adjuncts] is manifest [to such a devotee] in His form as Paramātmā. Therefore, ultimate welfare comes from Visņu alone [as stated in the Bhagavatam verse under discussion].

dissolution in relation to the gunas of prakṛti-rajas, sattva, and tamas. Of the three, although Visņu enacts the function of suste- nance, He remains untouched by these qualities (gunas). Thus, it is only through the worship of Visnu that humanity can attain the ultimate welfare.wapababais
The worship of this trinity can be undertaken either with the understanding that each member harbors the upadhi, or limitation, of his respective guna, or that they are transcendental to the gunas. In the latter case, the immateriality of Brahma and Śiva would be on the basis of their being partial manifestations of Paramātmā, whereas Visnu is Paramātmā Himself. If Brahma and Śiva are wor- shiped with the view that they have upădhis, then they cannot grant liberation, and even the boons of dharma, artha, and kāma derived from them will not be very pleasing. This is because the gunas of rajas and tamas are distressful and delusive, respectively. Libera- tion (mokṣa), however, is not possible through the worship of these two devas qualified by their upadhis. But even if one worships them as free of upādhis, liberation is achieved only belatedly, and that too comes as a result of considering them to be parts of Paramātmā. In essence, liberation ensues only from Visnu, the Paramātmā, and certainly not from Brahma or Śiva directly.
On the other hand, if Visnu is worshiped as delimited by sattva, one can still achieve dharma, artha, and kama from Him, and such benefits will be benign because sattva by nature is peaceful. If Visnu is worshiped without any such material motive, then one can also attain mokṣa. This is again because of the illuminating nature of sattva that leads to mokṣa. But if Visnu is worshiped with- out any upadhi, then one attains bhakti, the fifth human pursuit beyond dharma, artha, kāma, and mokṣa. Bhakti is manifest only from Paramātmā and not from any presiding deity of the gunas.
While commenting on this verse, Śrī Viśvanatha explains that Bhagavan assumes the role of an avatara in two ways - through His intrinsic potency, and through His extrinsic potency consist- ing of the three gunas. The first type of avatara includes manifes- tations, such as Matsya and Kurma. All of these are worshipable forms. The second type of avatara specifically refers to the three
96
1158 ms 12 Visnu Is Supreme among the Gunavatāras
forms that are related to the three gunas. Among these three, only Visnu is worshipable. Visnu is called sattva-tanu, or one whose body is purely of the nature of sattva. This sattva is not that of phenomenal being but belongs to His intrinsic potency of tran- scendental being-existence (viśuddha-sattva), as is said, &ldquo;Visnu is directly the Supreme Person, free of the gunas and beyond prakṛti&rdquo; (SB 10.88.5). For this reason, Viṣṇu cannot have any material upädhis, since the material energy has no power to delimit Him in any way. As such, by His mere proximity He maintains the cosmos through the illuminating potency of material sattva, all the while remaining indifferent to it. It is in this sense only that He is called a guṇāvatāra, and thus He is in no way less than a puruṣāvatāra.
Brahma, however, is a jiva and is associated with rajas for the purpose of creation. He is called an avatara simply because he is empowered by Visņu to enact the function of creation. This is con- firmed in Brahma-samhita (5.49), cited in the following anuccheda.
The ontological position of Śiva is different. He is neither of the category of Visņu nor that of a jiva, but that of Paramātmā endowed with material potency. According to Brahma-samhita (5.45, cited in the following anuccheda), he is the precipitate derived from Visņu, as yogurt is to milk. He is closely affiliated with Visņu, and thus there are numerous scriptural statements declaring him as nondif- ferent from the latter. Like Visņu, he too is addressed as Iśvara. Yet, he cannot be equated to Visņu in all respects, because he is in contact with the gunas of prakṛti. He is thus depicted as the hus- band of Durgā or Parvati, the deity of the material energy. Such being the case, one cannot transcend the gunas by worshiping him as Supreme. In conclusion, a deva like Śiva could be worshiped as:</p>
<ol>
<li>The independent Bhagavan. This is the concept of the Saivites. 2. The presiding deity of an aspect of the material energy, such as
tamas.</li>
<li>A devotee of Bhagavan Viṣṇu.</li>
<li>A partial manifestation of Visnu.

<li>A seat, adhiṣṭhāna, occupied by Visņu, i.e., an agent or represen- olytative of Vişņu manifesting His powers. In this case, one would adworship Vişņu through him.
Among these, the first type of worship is forbidden and is said to lead to degradation. The second type of worship will yield only material benefit. The other three types of worship can award the highest benefit. This is the significance of SB 1.2.23, the principal verse of this section. The essence is that no one but Visnu is the worshipable deity. For more details on this, see Anuccheda 106 of Bhakti Sandarbha.

THOSE Whose minds have been persuaded by the above state- ment about the oneness of the three [gunavatāras] [SB 1.2.23] quarrel [with those who assert that Visnu is supreme among the three gods]. To them we say the following: Although this hierarchy of relative superiority or inferiority [of these deities] is made only in relation to their respective posts, the presid- ing [deity] is the Supreme Puruşa (paraḥ puruşa ekaḥ), who is only one, since no distinction is possible in Him. The statement of nondistinction is true; nevertheless, the gradation is indeed unavoidable because of the recognition of the relative superior- ity or inferiority [of these gods due to their being] either direct or indirect manifestations [of Bhagavan]. Sūta makes this point with the help of an example:

Wood is a product of the earth and thus unlike smoke, which is partially made of fire. From this it follows that wood is devoid of light and not directly functional in the Vedic ritual. So, bet- ter than the wood used to kindle the sacrificial fire is the smoke [itself], which, being partly made of fire, [can be called] trayi- maya because it has comparatively greater utility in the Vedic rituals. Furthermore, superior even to smoke is the fire itself, since it is directly the element in which the Vedic sacrifices are performed.

In the same way, better than tamas, which is compared to wood [in this analogy] and is far removed from sattva-guna, is rajas, which is compared to smoke and, being a little closer to sattva, leads to Brahman realization.

through its being the cause of conditional knowledge (sopādhika- jñāna), rajas manifests but the outer glow of some inkling of Bha- gavan&rsquo;s attributes. Yet, it cannot lead to complete realization of the Absolute, since it is a source of distraction and disturbance (vikṣepa).

As to sattva, which is analogous to fire [in this example], it is direct realization of Brahman. It is directly and properly the gateway to the appearance of the qualities and form of the Abso- lute because its nature is inherently peaceful and pure.

As is also [stated in the prayers of the Śrutis]: &ldquo;The universe emanates from, and is dissolved back into, the Absolute, who remains unchanged, just as earthen pots are made out of and merge back into clay&rdquo; (SB 10.87.15).5

The following conclusions can be drawn, in order, from these three examples: In the first, Bhagavan, who is compared to the sun, is partially manifest in the form of Brahma, who is com- pared to a sun-crystal (surya-kanta). In the second, there is no such manifestation of Bhagavan, who is compared to milk, pro- jected into the form of Sambhu, who is compared to yogurt [as milk is not present as such in yogurt]. In the third example, how- ever, Bhagavan is fully manifest in the form of Viṣņu, who is compared to another lamp wick.dw (meg-idquod ail) inom

o al did yw sideviso ALTHOUGH the one Puruşa is manifest as Brahma, Visņu, and Śiva and there is no difference between them, they cannot be consid- ered as equals because Visnu is directly the Supreme Person and the other two are not. Their gradation is illustrated by the exam- ple of wood, smoke, and fire. Wood is inferior to smoke because no Vedic sacrifice can be performed with wood alone, even though fire is created by rubbing sticks together. Smoke, on the other hand, is close to fire, and thus the potential for such sacrifice is present in it. By this measure, fire is self-evidently superior. Similarly, rajas,

which implies action, is superior to tamas, which corresponds to ignorance and entropy. But sattva is superior to rajas because of its illuminating nature.
Śrī Jiva comments that rajas is also instrumental in illuminating Brahman. To attain Brahman realization, some suitable action has to be performed. For any action rajas is necessary. But rajas alone cannot lead to brahma-darśana, because its characteristic nature is that of vikṣepa, meaning that it gives rise to disruption and turmoil. Without sattva, rajas cannot yield such a result.
Śrī Jīva Gosvāmī cites three verses from Brahma-saṁhitā to show the respective positions of Brahma, Viṣṇu, and Śiva. In verse 5.45, Viṣṇu is compared to milk and Śiva to yogurt, a mod- ification of milk. This leads to the following question about Visņu: Is He Himself transformed when He becomes Śiva? If yes, then it would contradict numerous statements that establish Visnu as free from any modification. If no, then the example of milk and yogurt is misleading. So, Śrī Jiva replies in the negative. Visnu has tran- srational powers and thus does not undergo any transformation to become Śiva.
In the Purāṇas there is mention of a philosopher&rsquo;s stone, cinta- mani (lit., a thought-gem), which can create objects just by a per- son&rsquo;s will. This seems illogical, and if such a thing exists, then we are forced to accept that it has some transrational power. The Brahma-sutra (2.1.27) cited here implies that Bhagavan has incon- ceivable powers by which He can perform otherwise impossible deeds. Thus, He can manifest as Śiva without undergoing any mod- ification. The Vedas personified in their prayers offer the example bns nog
at unei szossed alsupe sa bers
The cintamani (&ldquo;thought-jewel&rdquo;) is a magical gem that transforms whatever it or touches into gold or whatever else one may wish for. Though the existence of such gems is evidently not scientific or an empirically verified reality, it is a metaphor that conveys a particular idea, in this case that of transforming without being transformed. It is not meant to be taken literally. Every language has its peculiarities, and problems arise when we translate culture specific zola ideas into a completely foreign language. In Sanskrit such things are called kavi-prasiddhi, or poetic testimony, which require no other proof. Some other examples are the ability of a swan to separate water from milk, or the Aśoka tree, which is said to bloom only when kicked by a beautiful damsel.

of clay. Various pots are made from clay, and after destruction, they merge back into clay. In this process, clay itself does not transform into something else. Similarly, Vişņu manifests as Śiva without undergoing any change in Himself.
Śrī Jiva says that Brahma, who is compared to a sun-crystal that reflects the light from the sun, has some similarity to Visņu, who is here compared to the sun itself. Brahma is an adherent of the Vedic way of life; he assists the devas and Manus in fulfilling their duties of sustaining the universe. These acts are reflective of the nature of Bhagavan Viṣṇu. But Śiva is totally different from Visnu in the same way that yogurt has a completely distinct nature from milk. Śiva puts on a garland of skulls, wraps snakes around his neck and arms and smears ashes on his body. He destroys the universe. This is just the opposite of Visnu&rsquo;s demeanor. dr D AUè ine
By contrast, however, the Viṣṇu guṇāvatāra is compared to a lamp that has been lit by another lamp and that shines with the same brilliance as the original. In the same way, this Visņu is identical to Paramātmā, though one arises out of the other.

ŚRI SUKA CONFIRMS the same [supremacy of Viṣnu] in three
verses:

Śiva ever remains united with his energy. As tri-linga [he who bears three marks], he is endowed with the three gunas of nature. He presides over the conditional &ldquo;I&rdquo;-principle [ahankära, or ego], which is threefold - sättvika, rājasika, and tāmasika. From this [ego] manifest the sixteen modifi-ple cations [of prakṛti]. One who worships [Śiva as presiding over] any among these [modifications] enjoys the fruit of all [material] opulences. But Bhagavan Visnu is the Supreme Per- son Himself, free from the three gunas and beyond material nature. He is all-seeing (sarva-drk) and the witness (upadraṣṭā). One who worships Him becomes free of the gunas of nature. (SB 10.88.3-5)1

Heine 14 Visnu Is beyond the Material Guņas
शश्वच्छक्तियुतः प्रथमतस्तावन् नित्यमेव शक्त्या गुणसाम्यावस्थप्रकृतिरूपोपाधिना युक्तः । गुणक्षोभे सति त्रिलिङ्गो गुणत्रयोपाधिः । प्रकटैश्च सद्भिस्तैर्गुणैः संवृतश्च । bla
The phrase &ldquo;ever remains united with his energy&rdquo; (sakti-yutaḥ śaśvat) means that Śiva is endowed from the very beginning, that is, always and eternally, with his energy, namely, the lim- iting adjunct (upadhi) formed by prakṛti, or the gunas in their state of equilibrium. When the gunas of nature are destabilized, he becomes tri-linga, or &ldquo;he who bears three marks,&rdquo; in that he takes on the limiting adjuncts of the three gunas. When these gunas are manifest, he is covered by them.
ननु तम उपाधित्वमेव तस्य श्रूयते कथं तत्तदुपाधित्वम् ? तत्राह - वैकारिक इति । अहमहन्तत्त्वं हि तत्तद्रूपेण त्रिधा । स च तदधिष्ठातेत्यर्थः । मुख्यतया नास्तां नामान्य- गुणद्वयं गौणतया त्वास्त एवेत्यर्थः ।
9971
A doubt is raised: It is heard [from authoritative sources] that Śiva has only tamas as a limiting adjunct, so how is it said here that he has three limiting adjuncts? This is answered in the sec- ond half of the first verse. [The &ldquo;three&rdquo; is a reference to] the &ldquo;I&rdquo;-principle (aham-tattva), which is of three types as specified here, and he presides over that ego. This means that even though it may be accepted that the other two gunas do not exist in him in the primary sense, their secondary presence must certainly be accepted.

the sixteen modifications. A person who worships [Śiva as pre- siding over] any among these modifications, taking that ele- ment as being connected to all opulences, attains the fruit that is aspired for. In other words, such fruit is obtained by worshiping him as delimited by that particular adjunct (upadhi).m (oving हि प्रसिद्धौ हेतौ वा । हरिस्तु प्रकृतेरुपाधितः परस्तद्धर्मैरस्पृष्टः । अत एव निर्गुणोऽपि कुतस्त्रिलिङ्गत्वादिकमिति भावः ।

But [in contrast to Śiva] Bhagavan Hari is transcendental to the limitations (upadhis) imposed by mate- rial nature, being untouched by its attributes. Therefore, being free of the gunas, how can He be limited by these three gunas (tri-linga) and so on [as is Śiva]?] based at 31 :heater al duob A

Now Śrī Śuka states the reason for this: Hari is directly the Puruşa Himself, namely, the Supreme Controller (Iśvara), and not separated like a reflection [from the reflected object]. There- fore, just as the word tanu (body) has been used [to mean energy or manifestation] in SB 11.11.3, &ldquo;Knowledge and ignorance are My two energies (tanu),&rdquo; in the same way, sometimes it is said that Hari is endowed with the energy of sattva, which simply means that He is related to it by rendering it functional through His mere glance, etc. [and not that He has it as an upadhi in the way that Śiva does].
अत एव सर्वेषां शिवब्रह्मादीनां दृक्ज्ञानं यस्मात् तथाभूतः सन्नुपद्रष्टा तदादिसाक्षी भवति । अतस्तं भजन् निर्गुणो भवेद् गुणातीतफलभाग्भवतीति ॥ श्रीशुकः ॥

THE THREE VERSES under discussion in this section were spoken by Sri Suka in response to a query raised by King Parikṣit: esinem adf zomat bas enim,hiva brutto asifamt bybiv esibod ad Śiva is he who appears outwardly as inauspicious (asiva) [having ow abandoned all enjoyment and social propriety], while Śrī Hari [Bhagavan Vişnu] is the husband of Lakṣmi, the Goddess of wealth and fortune. Nonetheless, it is observed that those among the he devas, asuras, and human beings who worship Śiva are generally opulent and enjoy sense pleasures, while those devoted to Visnuw Dare indigent. Why is this? (SB 10.88.1-2)308
Śrī Suka replied that Bhagavan Viṣṇu takes away the wealth of His devotees, which enables them to see through the false ego of independent enjoyership. This vision in turn becomes the basis of total self-surrender unto Bhagavan. They become fully devoted and attain Him, becoming free of the three gunas of nature. In contrast, Śiva blesses his devotees with material enjoyment, which aggra- vates the sense of enjoyership and diverts consciousness toward the mundane.rb

Being tran- scendental, He awards transempirical benedictions to His devotees. Material benedictions are temporary, and thus Bhagavan has no impetus to offer them. He is like a skilled physician who cures the disease from the root, without allowing his patient to eat the

rich food that might serve as momentary pleasure but is ultimately detrimental.
asing thosdo
Śri Jiva comments that sometimes it is said that Visnu is the presiding deity or possessor of the power of sattva-guna, just as Śiva is of tamas and Brahma of rajas. Kṛṣṇa Himself affirms this in the verse (SB 11.11.3) cited in the main text. In this verse, the word tanu does not mean &ldquo;body,&rdquo; although this is its most popular mean- ing. The word tanu is derived from the root √tan, which means to expand, to attenuate. Here it is used in the sense of energy or manifestation, and not the body, because vidya and avidya cannot be bodies. Vidya implies sattva, and avidya, rajas and tamas. The word tanu is used in place of sakti to signify that Bhagavan renders vidya and avidya functional without directly contacting them, just as the ātmā, or self, makes the body functional by its proximity.
A doubt that may be raised here is that since Vişņu interacts with sattva, and sattva is His potency, He must be influenced by it. Śrī Jiva clarifies that Visnu is not under the influence of sattva-guna. He is transcendental to sattva but animates it merely through His glance.www at V
to The knowledge of Śiva and Brahma is dependent úpon Visņu, who presides over the sattva from which knowledge arises. There- fore, He is called sarva-drk, the source of everyone&rsquo;s knowledge or awareness. This makes Him a witness to all, because to be a witness one must have awareness. Rajas produces distraction (vikṣepa), and tamas, torpor (laya). Both are obstacles to the witnessing capac- ity. Since Visnu is nirguna, one becomes nirguna by worshiping Him. This is the true result of worshiping Visnu - not material opulence. Thus, Visņu&rsquo;s devotees may or may not have material opulence since it is not their aim.

I The Ontology of Paramātmā - The Supreme Immanent Self
Commentary
AFTER ESTABLISHING the supremacy of Viṣņu over Brahma and Śiva, and showing that He is beyond the three gunas of nature, Śrī Jiva establishes that although Visnu is counted as one among the guṇāvatāras of the Purusa, He should not be regarded as a lesser manifestation. This was also the sense of comparing Visņu to one oil lamp lit by another (Brahma-samhita 5.46). Just as one lamp, though lit by another, is in every respect equal to the original, so Visnu is entirely the same, identical to the Purusa in essence and
power.
The
To show this, Śrī Jiva refers to a verse spoken by Brahma to his son Narada. One day, Narada approached Brahma and praised him as the supreme truth (SB 2.5.1-8). He addressed him as omniscient (sarvajña) and as the supreme regulator of all (sakaleśvara). Yet, he harbored a doubt: What need was there for Brahma to undergo severe penances if he indeed was the supreme master?
Brahma responded at length, denying his own supremacy and elucidating the reality of the Supreme Person. The verse cited in this anuccheda is part of his reply. In support of this verse, Śrī Jiva refers to the Maha Upaniṣad. From these verses it is clear that Brahma and Śiva are subordinate to Visņu, who is identical with the Supreme Purușa.

&ldquo;Nārāyaṇa is the Supreme Brahman, Nārāyaṇa is the Absolute Truth, the cosmic law, Truth, the Supreme Transcendence, and the Purusa, who is blackish-yellow (kṛṣṇa-pingala) in color&rdquo; (Mahā-nārāyaṇa Upanisad 11.4, 12.1).

16 Śrī Suka Also Hints at the Oneness between Visnu and the Puruşa
name of Visnu because He never takes birth within the material creation, unlike Brahma and Śiva. This also indicates His identity with the Purusa, who alone existed before the creation. The pro- noun &ldquo;He&rdquo; in verse 3.8.15 of Bhagavata Purana refers to the Purușa, who existed before the creation - before even the birth of Brahma and Śiva. This is understood from the context of the preceding
verses.
Although Jiva Gosvāmī has firmly established the supremacy of Visņu, to make it yet more evident, he takes up the subject again. He raises opposition by citing various references that seem to speak of Śiva&rsquo;s supremacy or equality with Visņu. Then, he provides the correct understanding of such statements. Such a process of estab- lishing a principle is called sthună-nikhanana-nyaya, i.e., driving a post into the ground or hitting a nail into a wall. The more the post or nail is hammered, the firmer it becomes. Similarly, the more a principle has objections raised against it that are then refuted, the more assuredly it becomes established. Sinnar framun
As said earlier, Śiva is a very prominent deity in India, and the supremacy of Visnu is not easily acceptable to non-Vaisnavas, espe- cially those who lean toward the worship of Śiva. Without clear- ing this confusion as regards Śiva&rsquo;s status in relation to Bhagavan Vişņu, it would be difficult to develop firm faith in bhakti unto Bha- gavan Śrī Kṛṣṇa, which is the abhidheya-tattva of the Bhāgavata Purāṇa. Hence, the present exercise is taken up.

A DOUBT IS RAISED: In the śāstras we find descriptions of the oneness of these three gods, such as, &ldquo;That person attains peace who does not see any distinction between the three of us Brahma, Śiva, and Myself [Visnu] - who have the same essen- tial nature and who are the Self of all living beings&rdquo; (SB 4.7.54), and, &ldquo;[They] do not perceive even an atom of difference between me (Śiva), Viṣņu, and Brahma&rdquo; (SB 12.10.22)? In other Purāņas, it is described that if one sees Brahma or Śiva as distinct from Vişņu, he goes to Naraka [the destination of wrongdoers after death].3

Naraka is an infernal region where those who flout the Vedic injunctions are obliged to enter after death. They are meted out punishment according to the severity of their offense. After due punishment, they again take birth as per their karma. There are many divisions of Naraka. A detailed description of the Naraka planets is given in Canto 5, Chapter 26 of Bhagavata Purāṇa.

117 Viṣṇu Is Inclusive of and Superior to Brahma and Śiva
ईश्वर इति न मन्तव्यं किन्तु विष्ण्वात्मक एव स स इति हि तत्रार्थः । तदुक्तम् “ब्रह्मणि ब्रह्मरूपः सः” (वामन० पु० ) इत्यादि ।
[Reply]: It is true. We also are not propounding a difference [between them], because we began this topic by saying that they are all forms of the Supreme Puruşa and are therefore one. The meaning here is that although Śiva and Brahma are seen to have distinct natures, and so on, in regard to their respective func- tions of dissolution and creation, they should not be considered as separate supreme controllers (Iśvara) independent of Visnu in the carrying out of these acts. Rather, they are in fact His own forms. Therefore, it is said, &ldquo;Bhagavan is situated in Brahma in the form of Brahma, and so on&rdquo; (Vamana Purana)
न च प्रकाशस्य साक्षादसाक्षाद्रपत्वादि तारतम्यं वयं कल्पयामः परं शास्त्रमेव वदति । शास्त्रं तु दर्शितम् । एवं भगवदवतारानुक्रमणिकासु त्रयाणां भेदमङ्गीकृत्यैव केवलस्य श्रीदत्तस्य गणना सोमदुर्वासोस्त्वगणना । किं च ब्राह्मे ब्रह्मवैवर्ते च ब्रह्मवाक्यम-
&ldquo;dmow&rdquo; ba sdr Nor are we imagining this hierarchy of direct and indirect forms of the different manifestations [of the Purusa], but it is the scripture itself dealing with transcendence that affirms it. We have simply made evident such scriptural statements. Simi- larly, while accepting that the three [Brahma, Visnu, and Śiva] are different, only the avatara [of Viṣṇu] Śrī Dattatreya was counted in the list of avataras of Bhagavan, and not those of Brahma (Soma) or Śiva (Durvāsā) (cf. SB 1.3.11). Moreover, there is a statement by Brahma in the Brahma Purana as well as in the
the Brahma Purana as well as in Brahma-vaivarta Purāna:

Since the latter&rsquo;s initial flux (ayana) [in the matter of cos- mic creation] takes place there, He is thus called Nārāyaṇa [He whose place of movement is the waters]&rdquo; (VP 1.4.6).

Dakṣa&rsquo;s sacrifice and cut off his head. Later on, Brahma and the other devas pacified Śiva, who fastened a goat&rsquo;s head to Dakṣa&rsquo;s torso, bringing him back to life. Then Dakṣa completed the sacri- fice in which Bhagavan Viṣṇu had appeared to accept the oblation. Vişņu was eulogized by the devas including Śiva and Brahma, and, after hearing their prayers, He answered them. The verse cited at the beginning of this section comes from that speech. Therein Vişņu appears to say that Brahma and Śiva are equal to Him, since all three are said to be the cause of the universe. It would thus seem improper to conclude that Visnu is superior to Brahma and Śiva.
The next verse discussed by Śrī Jiva is spoken by Śiva to the sage Mārkaṇḍeya (SB 12.10.22). One day, Mārkaṇḍeya was meditating in his asrama on the bank of the Puspabhadra River in the Malaya Mountains. When Śiva and his wife Parvati were traveling through the sky, Parvati saw Märkandeya and felt compassionate toward him, and so she urged Śiva to bless him. Śiva replied that the sage had attained perfection and had no desires to fulfill, yet he agreed to descend into the aśrama just to benefit from his company.
At that moment, the sage was in the state of samadhi and there- fore did not notice Śiva&rsquo;s arrival. So, Śiva devised a technique to draw him out of his samadhi. He entered into the sage&rsquo;s citta-vṛtti, or mental state, and thus the sage&rsquo;s object of meditation suddenly disappeared and he saw Śiva in his heart. This was a surprise to him, and he wondered what had happened. In a huff, he opened his eyes and saw Śiva standing directly in front of him. He then offered worship to Śiva and Parvati and recited prayers. Being pleased with his reception, Śiva spoke to the sage. The present verse is part of that dialogue. This verse also speaks of the oneness of Brahma, Śiva, and Visņu. Many Puranic verses state that if one regards these three devas as different from one another, such a person will enter Naraka. For example, the Padma Purāņa says:
14
Agaricini mu
It is an offense against the Holy Name to perceive the attributes and name of Śiva as different from those of Visnu. (Padma Purāṇa, Brahma-khanda 25.15)14

17 Visņu Is Inclusive of and Superior to Brahma and Śiva
And in the Narada Purāṇa:

To disregard one&rsquo;s guru, to criticize sadhus, to uphold a differ- ence between Hari and Śiva, and to criticize the Vedas, all on the strength of the Holy Name of Hari, is to strive simply for offenses. (Narada Purana 1.82.22)15

borIn response to all these verses, Śrī Jiva Gosvāmi argues that Brahma and Śiva are not separate from Visņu, yet they have dif- ferent roles in respect to the creation and dissolution. They are not independent controllers, but manifestations of Visnu for executing specific functions. However, this does not mean that Brahma and Śiva are equal to Visņu. For Śrī Jiva, that Brahma and Śiva are not different from Visnu means that they are not independent of Him.
In GĪTĀ 7.19, Śrī Kṛṣṇa declares that one who sees everything as Vasudeva (a name for Visņu) is a rare exalted being. This does not mean that everything is Visnu in His complete form. Rather, it means that everything is a manifestation of Visnu&rsquo;s energy and thus not independent of Him. Everything manifests from Him, but all manifestations are not equal to Him in all respects. There are varieties and gradations of manifestations - a fact that is borne out by our own experience. Visnu is the only independent entity, the Supreme Person, for which there is ample scriptural evidence. The simple principle of real causation is that an effect is both non- different from its cause and dependent upon it. A cause, however, is not identical to its effect and is independent of it.
As was described in Anuccheda 10, the sage Atri prayed to the Supreme Regulator of the universe. In response to this plea, Brahma, Śiva, and Visnu each appeared before him and blessed him to have a son like themselves. By their blessings, three sons were born, named Soma, Durvāsā, and Dattatreya. Now, in the list of avatāras given in the First Canto, the son of Atri, named Dattatreya, is enumerated as the sixth, but the other two are not mentioned. Dattatreya was born by the blessing of Visnu, and his

inclusion in this list implies the superiority of Viṣṇu over Brahma and Śiva.
blodg
This demonstrates that the manifestations of Śiva and Brahma in the form of Durvāsā and Soma are not on a par with Dattatreya, a manifestation of Visņu. Moreover, it may further be noted that in all lists of avataras only the descents of Visnu are named, and not those of Śiva or Brahma, nor are these gods themselves named as avataras. In Bhagavad Gita (4.8), Kṛṣṇa says that He comes as an avatara to establish dharma. There are no such statements about Śiva or Brahma.
bo There are also explicit statements declaring that it is highly improper to consider Brahma and Śiva as equal to Visņu. These apparently contradictory scriptural declarations, i.e., one should not consider Śiva and Brahma as different from Visņu, and one should not see Brahma or Śiva as equal to Visņu, must be rec- onciled in order to establish their real intent. This requires proper understanding, which Śrī Jīva attempts to provide in this anuccheda.

1 The Ontology of Paramātmā - The Supreme Immanent Self
The devas headed by Brahma and Myself are grantors of liberation from this material world only by the grace of Śiva. There is no doubt in this. Śiva is the Great God (Mahadeva) and great con- troller (Maheśvara), both in name and deed. O sinless one! Oth- ers are only gods, but not the Great God. (Skanda Purāṇa, Sūta- Apsamhita 25.47, 25.51)23
In Svetāśvatara Upanisad it is said:
da
Everywhere are his faces, heads, and necks. He is in the cavity of everyone&rsquo;s heart. He is the all-pervading Bhagavan. Therefore, Śiva is everywhere. (śu 3.11)24

Visnu is the effect and Brahma the action, but Maheśvara (Śiva) is the cause. It is only for the purpose of creation that Śiva, who is one, manifests in three forms. (Rudra-hrdaya Upanisad 15)25
The Utpatti-tantra declares the worship of Śiva as compulsory for everyone:

1-17 Visņu Is Inclusive of and Superior to Brahma and Śiva
through existence (sütrātmā), and the cosmic being (virat). I am im Brahma, Vişņu, Rudra, Gauri, Brahmi, and Vaiṣṇavī. I am the sun, the stars, and the moon. Whatever is seen or heard - inside or out - I am always situated there while pervading it. There is no manifest object, movable or immovable, that is abandoned by me. (Devi-bhāgavata Purana 7.33.12b, 13, 14a, 16-17a)27 H61
From the statements of Padma Purana and Varaha Purana cited in this anuccheda, it can be understood that scriptural assertions declaring Śiva, or any god other than Visnu, as supreme are set forth for persons whose faith and eligibility accords with the gunas of rajas and tamas. At the level of self-identity that is presently plugged into rajas and tamas, the nirguna truth that Visnu embod- ies either makes no sense at all or is seen to be without pragmatic relevance. For this reason, the above-mentioned scriptural asser- tions serve to divert consciousness away from the nirguna truth, and to stabilize faith and awareness in the specific level for which such a person has eligibility. In this way, too, the cycle of nat- ural creation is perpetuated. So, the statements regarding Śiva&rsquo;s supremacy are relative in the sense that they have value for those at the lower to middle range of consciousness evolution. From the perspective of nirguna truth, however, they are not to be taken in their primary sense. This is also supported by other passages in the Devi-bhāgavata Purāṇa:
In this world, whatever scriptures oppose Śruti and Smrti are surely tamasika. [The Tantra] scriptures, such as the Vāma, Kapā- Blaka, Kaulaka, and Bhairava Āgamas, are propounded by Śiva only
V to bewilder people and not for anything else. Paris

parts. A brāhmaṇa has no right at all to accept the other por- tions that are different from the Vedic teachings. A person who is not qualified to follow the Veda is eligible only for Tantra. (Devi-bhāgavata Purana 7.39.26-27, 31-32) 28
The division of the Puranas according to the three gunas is spo- ken of by Śiva to Parvati. Prior to this topic, Śiva explains the signif- icance of fasting on the eleventh day of the lunar fortnight (Ekādaśī- vrata) for the pleasure of Visņu. In this context, he explains the procedure for observing the fast and lists the things to be avoided. One of the prohibitions forbids not only the association of heretics (pāṣaṇḍīs), but even the act of merely looking upon them. Śiva then provides a lengthy list of people who fit his description of heretics. Included in the list are people who smear their bodies with ashes or adorn themselves with garlands of skulls.
Hearing this description, Parvati raises a question about Śiva himself, as to why he adorns his body with ashes, skulls, bones, and leather - the very articles forbidden by him and considered unclean. On this inquiry, Śiva becomes very grave and replies that although it is the topmost secret, he will divulge it to Pārvati because she is extremely dear to him. 928 lbbim wol adt is
Śiva relates that in the reign of Svayambhuva Manvantara, the great daityas like Namuci became devoted to Visnu and restrained themselves from all immoral acts. They devoted themselves to the Vedic principles and conduct. This greatly troubled the devas, headed by Indra, because they were consequently incapable of sub- duing the daityas. Being distressed, they approached Visnu and pleaded for His help. At that time, Viṣṇu ordered Śiva to behave like a heretic and propagate tāmasika scriptures. Hearing this, Śiva became sad and said, &ldquo;O Lord, I will do as You command, but this

will bring about my ruin.&rdquo; Bhagavan Visņu conferred upon him a thousand of His Names and a six syllable mantra to chant. This would provide him protection.
Śiva then describes how he propagated tamasika scriptures, the Māyāvāda doctrine, Saiva-śästra, and so on. He also lists the Purāņas according to the divisions of the gunas. He concludes: &ldquo;The sättvika Purāņas lead to liberation, the rajasika Purāņas are ever inauspicious, and the tamasika Purāņas lead to hell, O Devi&rdquo; (Padma Purana, Uttara-khanda 235.21-22).
The verse cited from Varaha Purana is spoken by Bhagavan Visnu. In the same chapter, Śiva explains why it is that people are bewildered about the real spiritual path, which is bhakti to Hari. He tells sage Agastya that in the past, all human beings on earth were pious and engaged in bhakti to Kṛṣṇa. As a result, liberation became the normal state of affairs for all of them. Concerned about this, the devas approached Visnu and submitted to Him that the cre- ation would not be able to proceed in this manner, since everyone was engaged in bhakti. Hearing this, Visņu said that He would cre- ate delusion and ordered Śiva to propagate illusory scriptures. Śiva then relates the story of how sage Gautama cursed the brahmanas to become heretics in Kaliyuga and how they propagated delusory literature, being bewildered by Śiva.
The hermeneutic principle that Jiva Gosvāmi proposes is that not all scriptures carry equal authority. Although different scrip- tures apparently seem to propound different deities or spiritual practices, their ultimate aim culminates in only one Absolute Real- ity. There is no conflict among the scriptures, as confirmed by Brahma-sutra (1.1.4): &ldquo;But the truth that Brahman is knowable only through the Vedas is due to the fact that the Vedas are consistently reconciled in Him alone.&ldquo;29 Śrī Jīva continues with this theme by citing from the Nārāyaṇīya section of Mahabharata.

This [fact] is known from the same section of Mahabharata (Santi-parva 349.59).

In the fifth verse, he establishes the superiority of the Pañcarātra [scrip- tural tradition] alone, saying that it is spoken by Bhagavan Himself.

the divine nature conclude that they all culminate only in Śrī Nārāyaṇa, who is propounded [as Bhagavan] in the Pañcaratra. This is stated in the fifth verse. In the second half of the sixth verse, sage Vaisampayana censures those of materialistic men- tality. This is reiterated in the Vişnu-dharma Purana and the Agni Purana:

In this world, there are two types of created beings - divine Brand materialistic. Those who are consummately engaged in devotion to Bhagavan Visnu are divine, whereas those preoccupied in exactly the opposite are materialistic. (Agni Purana 381.39)31

It may be asked: In different scriptures, different opinions are expressed [so how can anyone know that Visnu is their pur- pose?]. In response, the sage speaks the seventh verse. The authors of scriptures other than the Pañcaratra are of two types - those with limited knowledge and the omniscient. The first are those who offer a partial [or one-dimensional] view of the Absolute Reality that accords with their own respective metaphysics. Just as a description of a part of the ocean is still a description of the ocean, their explanations also culminate in the complete reality, Bhagavan Nārāyaṇa, even though they speak of Him in a limited way.

1331 The Ontology of Paramātmā - The Supreme Immanent Self
ये तु सर्वज्ञास्ते चैवमभिप्रयन्ति – नास्माभिरासुराणां मोहनार्थमेव कृतानि शास्त्राणि किन्तु दैवानां व्यतिरेकेण बोधनार्थम् । ते हि रजस्तमः शबलस्य खण्डस्य च तत्त्वस्य तथा क्लेशबहुलस्य साधनस्य च प्रतिपादकान्येतानि शास्त्राणि दृष्ट्वा वेदांश्च दुर्गमान् दृष्ट्वा च निर्विद्य सर्ववेदार्थसारस्य शुद्धाखण्डतत्त्व श्रीनारायणस्य सुखमयतदाराधनस्य च सुष्ठु प्रतिपादके पञ्चरात्रे एव गाढं प्रवेक्ष्यन्तीति । तदेतदाह “निःसंशयेषु ” इति ।
On the other hand, those who are omniscient have the following intention [saying thus]: &ldquo;The scriptures have not been authored by us simply to confound the materialists, but to enlighten those of divine nature through negative inferential insight (vyati- reka). After examining these scriptures that propound a partial [and hence divided] view of reality that is mixed with rajas and tamas and that propose excessively arduous [spiritual] prac- tices, and after seeing that the Vedas are difficult to comprehend, people will lose interest [in these other texts]. They may then plunge deep into the Pañcarātra, which skillfully establishes the pure undivided [i.e., complete] Absolute Reality, Bhagavan Nārāyaṇa, who is the essence of all the Vedas and whose worship is easily executed.&rdquo; It is to this end, then, that Vaiśampāyana speaks the eighth verse.
तस्माज् झटिति वेदार्थप्रतिपत्तये पञ्चरात्रमेवाध्येतव्यमित्याह “पञ्चरात्र” इति । यत एवं तत उपसंहरति “साङ्ख्यं च योगं च ” इति । तदेवं पञ्चरात्रप्रतिपाद्यस्य श्रीभगवत एवमुत्कर्षे स्थिते “आत्मारामाश्च मुनयः” (भा० १।७।१०) इत्याद्यसकृदपूर्वमुपदिशता श्री- भागवतेन प्रतिपाद्यरूपस्य तस्य किमुतेत्यपि विवेचनीयम् ।
Consequently, in order to incite exclusive study of the Pañcara- tra for those who wish to quickly apprehend the true mean- ing of the Vedas, Vaiśampāyana goes on to speak the ninth verse. And because this is the situation, he concludes with the final verse. Thus, if the supremacy of Bhagavan is estab- lished as the teaching of the Pañcarātra, then how much more supreme is the form of Bhagavan that is established as such by the Srimad Bhagavatam, a [text] which time and again offers unprecedented teachings such as this: &ldquo;The sages, though freed from the knot of egoic identity, and though delighting in the
134
17 Visnu Is Inclusive of and Superior to Brahma and Śiva
Self alone, engage in causeless devotion to Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the majes- tic player. Such, indeed, are the entrancing qualities of Śrī Hari (Kṛṣṇa)&rdquo; (SB 1.7.10).32 This specific form established by the Bhagavata Purana should be discussed.
Commentary
respect sadbgass sgoy sydne
One may ask why śästra would involve the intention to bewilder people. In reply, Śrī Jīva says that not all scriptures carry equal authority. The scriptures are related to the three gunas of prakṛti, just as Vişņu, Brahma, and Śiva are also similarly related. As Visņu, the facilitator of sattva-guna, is superior to Brahma and Śiva, the scriptures connected to sattva are also superior to those of rajas and tamas. This is so because only sattva can release one from material bondage, as confirmed by Śiva, &ldquo;A conditioned being is liberated by sattva, whose essence is Nārāyaṇa&rdquo; (Varaha Purana 70.20).33 Peo- ple become attracted to deities and scriptures in correspondence to the guna, or nature, with which they are predominantly identified (sama-sila bhajanti vai, SB 1.2.27). Those who are under the influ- ence of rajas and tamas would naturally be attracted to the deities connected to those gunas, and the śästras provide them support by strengthening their faith in those particular deities. Bhagavan Śrī Kṛṣṇa also affirms this point: &ldquo;I alone supply unwavering faith to the devotees of various deities toward whatever specific deity they wish to worship with faith&rdquo; (GITA 7.21)34
True knowledge, however, comes only from sattva, which has an illuminating nature. The correct understanding of sastra can be known only when one is impelled by sattva. Furthermore, any statement that contradicts the sättvika scripture must be inter- preted to reconcile with it. The conclusion of all scripture is that Visnu is the Supreme Person and that devotion to Him alone is

both the means and the end. The various opinions exist because people with a materialistic nature do not accept Visņu as Supreme, so they are naturally attracted to scriptures related to other paths, even though those too lead to Visnu indirectly.
T
The verses cited here are spoken by sage Vaiśampāyana in response to King Janamejaya&rsquo;s query about the ultimate purpose of Sankhya, Yoga, Pañcarātra, and Aranyaka. From the sage&rsquo;s reply, it is evident that there are three divisions of sastra, namely, the Vedas (also called nigama), the Pañcaratra (also called agama), and the darśanas propagated by various sages. The intention of the authors of śästra is to bring people to the Absolute Reality, Bhaga- van. The Pañcarātra is written as an alternative to the Veda, which is very difficult to understand and follow. Nor is everyone eligible to follow it.
The authors of sastra other than the Pañcarātra, are of two types - those who know Reality only in part and those who know it fully. The first group writes according to their own realizations, and that too is a description of the Ultimate Reality, albeit only in part. The second group writes to bring people to the Pañcaratra path, seeing that following the Veda is cumbersome and that the paths propagated by the first group are imperfect, being related to rajas and tamas.
Sometimes competition is needed in order to realize an object&rsquo;s worth. Bhagavan Rama&rsquo;s prowess was known because of Rāvana. Without Rāvana, Śrī Rāma would have lived an ordinary life and people might not have appreciated His greatness. It is for this rea- son that many types of literature are written. One of their aims may be to keep the ãsurika people busy with some sort of discipline and practice so that they do not cause too much of a disturbance in society. As it is said, an idle mind is the devil&rsquo;s workshop and the idle mind of a devil would be a devil&rsquo;s factory!
попоуз
The other purpose is to provide those whose nature is primar- ily sättvika with a suitable context in which they may consider contradictory points of view presented in the form of an oppo- nent&rsquo;s position (purva-pakṣa). By refuting such oppositional views, they come to understand the Pañcaratra theology more decisively.
136
17 Visņu Is Inclusive of and Superior to Brahma and Śiva
Moreover, although it is said that there are two types of people, namely, daiva and asurika, the fact remains that the majority of peo- ple are a mixture of both. So the rajasika and tamasika inclinations persist even in those who are principally of divine nature. These inclinations need to be uprooted to intensify one&rsquo;s faith and fixity in Visņu. Thus, the third category of literature aids in this respect by functioning as a counterpoint (pürva-paksa).
The subject of the Pañcaratra is Vişņu. Therefore, according to Mahābhārata, one should follow the Pañcaratra system. Śrī Jīva is using this as an a fortiori argument to inspire people to study the Bhāgavatam, which describes Bhagavan in such an unprece- dented manner that even ātmārāmas like Sukadeva are captivated to study it. The ātmārama has no desires to fulfill and no aims to achieve, yet even such a self-realized sage is attracted to the study of the Bhāgavatam, a substantial book. How much more interest, then, should a common person take in it? For this reason, Śrī Jiva next investigates what the Bhagavata Purāna has to say about the relative superiority of the three devas.

[Answer]: No, this is not the implication of the above verse. There is a Vedic principle, &ldquo;Gods excel in power when they are praised through glorious words.&ldquo;37 Thus, such a conclusion [that Śiva is Supreme] is improper. This prayer was uttered simply to induce Śiva to drink the deadly poison [called] kalakūṭa. In the same section, Śiva says: &ldquo;When Bhagavan Hari is pleased, then I and all the moving and non-moving beings are pleased&rdquo; (SB 8.7.40).38

And [Śiva again says]: &ldquo;Remaining under the control of that Supreme Person, we are like birds controlled by a string&rdquo; (SB 5.17.23).40 So, it is not the case [that Śiva is Supreme, as might be inferred from SB 8.7.31 above], because such a conclusion is contradicted by the above statements of Śiva. Alternatively, the meaning [of that verse] can be taken as follows: It is indeed fit- ting that even He [Visnu] is unable to know completely the con- scious being called Paramātmā, situated within the effulgence of Śiva.

Commentary
150/61
In Śiva Purāna (4.41.4-5) Śiva, or Sadasiva, is described as the only deva capable of awarding mukti, as being beyond the three gunas, and as the Supreme Reality, Parabrahman.45 He is also charac- terized therein as the controller and source of Brahma, Rudra, and Visņu (Śiva Purana 7.6.3). But from the Bhāgavatam verses cited in this section, it is certain that Brahma, Viṣṇu, and Śiva are not expansions of Sadasiva. It is for this reason that in scrip- tures that describe Sadasiva as Supreme, it is said that Bhagavan and Puruşa are called Sadasiva and not the reverse. Bhagavan is everything, vasudevaḥ sarvam iti (GITA 7.19), and so He is also

Sadasiva. Consequently, statements, such as those referred to in Siva Purana, are there to explain the glory of Sadasiva and should not be taken to mean that Sadasiva is Bhagavan. But in Bhagavata Purāṇa, the cream of all scriptures, in the context of deciding who is supreme among this trinity, there is no mention that Bhagavan or the Purusa is Sadasiva.
F
If one carefully examines the verses from Śiva Purāņa cited here in their proper context, one can understand that the word siva in these verses refers to the Supreme Absolute Truth and not to the guṇāvatāra called Śiva. It is clearly stated therein that Brahman is called Śiva (Siva Purana 4.41.14). In Bhakti Sandarbha (Anuccheda 265), Śrī Jiva Gosvāmī explains, with support from the Purānas, that originally all names, such as Śiva and Brahma, belong to Svayam Bhagavan, Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Some of them are also used for gods like Śiva. In Śiva Purana, the name Śiva, referring to Kṛṣṇa, has been used so that the followers of Śiva can worship him with faith.
An objection may be raised: In the verse spoken by Kasyapa to Diti (SB 3.14.28) and cited here, Bhagavan Siva is described as Supreme, as the cause of the universe and the master of gods like Brahmā. Śrī Jīva says that this statement means that Śiva is non- different from Vişņu, the Paramātmā. Kaśyapa spoke this verse to his wife Diti to dissuade her from cohabiting with him at an inappropriate time. He was decidedly trying to impress upon her the perilous repercussions of such an untimely act, so that she would give up the irreligious thought. In that moment, Kasyapa was certainly not expounding in any formal way the superiority of Śiva over Visņu. It is important to keep the context in mind while interpreting scripture.
A further objection is raised: When the devas and asuras churned the Milk Ocean, a deadly poison came out. The poison posed a threat to the universe, and so the devas asked Bhagavan Śiva to drink it and bring it under control. In their prayers to him, the gods stated that Śiva is beyond Brahma and Visņu (SB 8.7.31).
Śrī Jīva clarifies that the devas hoped that Śiva would take up the extraordinary feat of drinking the poison, and so they glorified
142

him, because &ldquo;the power of the gods increases when they are glo- rified.&rdquo; What this means is that a person becomes enthusiastic to attempt even a daunting task if he is praised. Praise does not pro- vide any real extra power to a person, but simply enthuses him. It is for this reason that kings were praised by bards in the past. Much encouragement is needed to effectively maintain a responsible post like that of a king, because the king has to face many enemies even from within his own coterie. There was always a danger to his life. In modern times, cheerleaders enthuse athletes. Psycholo- gists advise parents not to criticize their children lest they become stunted in their abilities. Motivational speakers recommend the power of positive thinking. Praising another means helping that person to maintain a beneficial positive attitude. ad lolsvise
To these arguments one may respond that Śri Jiva is biased and therefore misinterpreting the Bhāgavata Purana verses to suit his purpose. Anticipating such an objection, Śrī Jiva responds with a few other verses from the Bhāgavatam in which Śiva per- sonally affirms his subordination to Visņu (in order of citation, 8.7.40, 9.4.56, and 5.17.23), whereas the earlier testimonials to Śiva&rsquo;s supremacy were spoken by others. In fact, Śiva declares that he drinks the poison to please Bhagavan Viṣṇu, in whose pleasure he finds his own fulfillment. One may further argue that the Bhāga- vata Purana is itself biased in favor of Visņu. To this we reply that such is not the case. In Tattva Sandarbha (Anucchedas 18-26), the Bhāgavata Purana was established as the most authoritative scripture in the matter of the self-disclosure of the Absolute Real- ity, tattva. In this anuccheda, this conclusion is further corrobo- rated by the rationale that only sättvika scriptures can offer veridi- cal knowledge of the Absolute. Rajasika and tāmasika scriptures, including Śiva Purana, were never intended to do so, as they are meant to provide instructions for those at the corresponding level of self-identity.
Jiva subsequently suggests an alternative meaning for SB 8.7.31, namely, that the conscious Self called Paramātmā, situated in the effulgence of Śiva, is not known completely even by Visnu Himself. This is corroborated in SB 10.87.41, a verse spoken by the personified
1431 The Ontology of Paramātmā - The Supreme Immanent Self
Vedas. In this verse, the Vedas say that it is not only the devas who do not know the limits of the Supreme Person, even He Himself does not know the extent of His own powers, because He is limit- less. Furthermore, according to Brahma-samhita (5.8, 10), Sadasiva (therein referred to as Sambhu) is a part of Bhagavan, as described earlier in Anuccheda 2 of Paramatma Sandarbha. al tomog
To summarize this section with conclusive evidence from the Bhagavatam, Śrī Jiva quotes a verse spoken by Sūta Gosvāmī (SB 1.18.21). The reference is to the story of Visnu as Bhagavan Vamana, wherein He begged three steps of land from Bali. When Bali agreed to donate the land to Vamana Deva, the latter expanded in size and covered the entire universe in two steps, reaching Satyaloka, the abode of Brahma. Lord Brahma washed His foot by pouring water on it and then stored the water in his sacred pot, kamandalu. This then became the holy river Ganga.toos
In Hindu culture, the water that washes the feet of the deity of Bhagavan is called caraṇāmṛta, and it is revered as holy water. Peo- ple sip this water and sprinkle it on their heads whenever they visit a temple. When the Ganga descended to the Earth at the request of Bhagiratha, Lord Siva accepted her on his head. This shows that Śiva was eager to take Visnu&rsquo;s caraṇāmṛta on his head out of respect for Him. Therefore, SB 1.18.21 concludes that only Mukunda (Visņu) is the Supreme Person, and not Brahma or Śiva. antrupiny
With this verse, Śrī Jiva concludes his argument about the supe- riority of Visnu to the other guṇāvatāras and His identity with Paramātmā, the Immanent Self of the universe, and with Bhaga- vän, the Supreme Person. During this discussion, he also argued in favor of the superiority of sättvika scriptures. The portion of Para- mätma Sandarbha devoted to the gunavataras now concludes with a verse from Bhāgavata Purana in the following anuccheda.

of His own powerty because He la limit KRSNA&rsquo;S ELDER BROTHER BALADEVA spoke this verse to the Kau- ravas who had captured Samba, one of Kṛṣṇa&rsquo;s sons. Baladeva had come to retrieve His nephew, but the Kauravas pridefully insulted Him. This made Baladeva furious, and He responded with words of chastisement. In this verse, Balarama clearly says that He and Lakṣmi, let alone Brahma and Śiva, are only portions of a portion of Krsna.
Śrī Jiva has chosen this particular verse with the intention of building a basis for Śrī Kṛṣṇa Sandarbha. As far as the supremacy of Viṣṇu in the trinity of guṇāvatāras is concerned, this verse does not add much more than what has already been discussed. But it pro- vides the additional insight that Krsna is superior even to Balarama, who is listed among the avataras of the Puruşa, meaning that He too is Visņu. This means that Kṛṣṇa is beyond even Visņu, which will be the principal theme of Śrī Kṛṣṇa Sandarbha.
Thus far, Śrī Jīva has discussed the three puruṣāvatāras of Viṣṇu and the three guṇāvatāras. Of the guṇāvatāras, Viṣṇu is shown to be supreme, and it is He who manifests as Brahma and Śiva. Next, in Anucchedas 19 to 47, Śrī Jiva will explain the jiva, the individual liv- ing being who is under the regulation of Paramātmā. This topic is subsidiary to the discussion of Paramātmā proper. This contiguity of subjects is known as prasanga-sangati, or contextual correlation.
Śrī Jiva began the entire discussion of ontology (prameya) from the declaration that Absolute Reality (tattva) is one but express- ible in sound form as the three appellations Brahman, Paramātmā, and Bhagavan (SB 1.2.11). Brahman and Bhagavan were dealt with in Bhagavat Sandarbha. In the beginning of this volume, Param- ātmā was shown to be the regulator of the jivas and prakṛti. So, after establishing the ontology of Paramātmā, who is the regula- tor, Śrī Jiva takes up the ontology of the regulated, first discussing the status of the jiva, followed by an exposition of prakṛti. We can conclude from this that the order of topics discussed by Jiva

Gosvāmī in the first three Sandarbhas, from Bhagavan to Param- atma, to the jiva, and finally to prakṛti, is on the basis of a descend- ing order of importance, Bhagavan being the only self-existent and independent Reality.

II The Ontology of the Jiva - Taṭastha-śakti
The letter m [in Om] signifies the jiva, &ldquo;the witness of the presen- tational field of the body&rdquo; (kṣetrajña), who is always dependent upon and subservient to the Supreme Self, Paramātmā. He is [constitutionally] a servant of Bhagavan Hari only and never of anyone else. He is the conscious substratum, endowed with the attribute of knowledge. He is conscious and beyond matter.
He is never born, undergoes no modification, is of one [unchang- ing] form, and situated in his own essential identity (svarupa). He is atomic [i.e., the smallest particle without any parts], eter- nal, pervasive of the body, and intrinsically of the nature of consciousness and bliss. He is the referent of the pronoun &ldquo;I,&rdquo; imperishable, the proprietor of the body, distinct from all other (9 jivas, and never ending. The jiva cannot be burnt, cut, wetted,
or dried, and is not subject to decay. He is endowed with these and other attributes. He is indeed the irreducible remainder ein(seṣa) [i.e., the integrated part] of the Complete Whole. (Padma T (Purana, Uttara-khanda 226.34-37) lands all timers to di Jadi vismen st.11.2 8e ni

19 Introduction to Jiva-tattva
The ātmā is neither god, nor human, nor subhuman, nor is it an immovable being [a tree, mountain, and so on]. It is not the body, nor the senses, mind, vital force, or the intellect.
jogge
It is not inert, not mutable, nor mere consciousness. It is to conscious of itself and self-luminous; it is of one form and is
situated in its own essential nature.
It is conscious, pervades the body, and is intrinsically of the nature of consciousness and bliss. It is the direct referent of the pronoun &ldquo;I,&rdquo; is distinct [from other individual selves] in each body, atomic [i.e., the smallest particle without further parts], eternal, and unblemished.
It is intrinsically endowed with the characteristics of knower- ship [cognition], agency [conation], and experiential capacity [affectivity]. Its nature by its own inner constitution is to be always the unitary, irreducible remainder [i.e., the integrated the part] of the Complete Whole, Paramātmā?

II The Ontology of the Jiva - Taṭastha-sakti
Just as the vital force (prāna) remains unchanging as it accom- panies the individual living being (jiva) in whichever different species it may appear, whether born from eggs, wombs, seeds, or perspiration, the ātmā is unchanging in the state of deep sleep when the senses and ego are deactivated and there is free- dom from the subtle body, which is the cause of transforma- tion. Yet, upon awakening, the remembrance comes to us that we slept peacefully without awareness of anything [and this indicates that in deep sleep the self is present as pure witness devoid of the content of sensual, mental, or egoic awareness]. (SB 11.3.39)3
इत्यनेन । देहादित्वं निरस्यन्नाह (भा० ११।१०।८)

The second characteristic, that the jiva is distinct from the body, the senses, and so on, is stated by Bhagavan Śrī Kṛṣṇa:swis

The ātmā, which is the witness and self-aware, is distinct from f of the subtle and gross bodies, in the same way that fire, which burns and illumines, is different from the wood that is burnt.

The reason the ātmā is distinct [from the subtle and gross bod- ies] is that he is their witness as well as their illuminator, but the ātmā itself is self-aware (sva-drk), meaning it is self-luminous.

15619 Introduction to Jiva-tattva i
Commentary fotoshab ssd abs mal sad at ataug 200 (andasin wardvilingos) qurierswoni laman biotique et botte UP TO THIS POINT, Śrī Jiva has described the ontology of Param- ātmā. In doing so, he has explained Paramātmā&rsquo;s three manifesta- tions as the supreme regulator of the metacosm, the macrocosm, and the microcosm and also His identity among the trinity of gods. Paramātmā is the regulator of the innumerable jivas and of mate- rial nature (prakṛti). To understand the regulator, it is necessary to understand the regulated, just as to understand a manager one also needs to know his field of action. As such, realization of the jiva precedes that of Paramātmā.
Śrī Jiva began his entire discussion of the knowable (prameya) with the famous vadanti verse (SB 1.2.11), cited first in Tattva Sanda- rbha (Anuccheda 51). His exposition of the knowable has contin- ued right through the Bhagavat and Paramätma Sandarbhas. On the basis of contextual correlation (prasanga-sangati), in which suc- ceeding topics are auxiliary to preceding ones, Śrī Jiva took up the discussion of Paramātmā first and not that of the jiva. For this reason, he now begins a new topic, delineating the essential nature and qualities of the jiva, beginning with this anuccheda and continuing to Anuccheda 47. dataandagi basin
Śrī Jiva begins by first citing four verses from Padma Purāṇa, which describe the nature of the jiva. He then quotes four more verses of Jāmātṛ Muni, which paraphrase the Padma Purāņa verses. Ramya Jāmātṛ Muni (1370-1443) was a follower of Rāmānujācā- rya and popularly known as Varavara Muni. He was also called Mānavala Mahamuni and was the founder of one of the Śrī Sam- pradaya&rsquo;s two main sects, the Tengalai School. We have not been able to trace the exact source of these versese dirigogine
In the upcoming anucchedas, Śrī Jiva analyses the statements of Jāmātṛ Muni and provides supporting references from Bhāga- vata Purāna. Why does Śrī Jiva prefer Jāmātṛ Muni over Padma Purāṇa when Jāmātṛ virtually repeats the words of the Purāṇa?

Our guess is that the verses are taken from the commentary on some work of Lokācārya Pillai, who wrote 18 rahasyas (esoteric doctrines) on which Jämätṛ Muni has commented.

II The Ontology of the Jiva - Taṭastha-śakti
Our guess is that Jāmātṛ adds three characteristics that are not stated there explicitly, namely, knowership (cognitive awareness), doership (conation), and experiential capacity (affectivity). The Advaita Vedantis do not accept these three as inherent capacities of the jiva, intrinsic to its very nature. Rather, they view them as limiting adjuncts (upadhis) of the self, having empirical validity only. These views stand diametrically opposed to the core teaching of theistic Vedanta, or in other words, of the Vaisnavas, including Jiva Gosvāmī. For Vaisnavas it is crucial to acknowledge the jiva as eternally distinct from and subservient to Paramātmā. For this to be possible, the jiva must be inherently endowed with knowership, agency, and experiential capacity.in aid naged svit h
An object has two types of defining characteristics (lakṣaṇa), called taṭastha and svarupa. The purpose of defining the charac- teristics of an object is to distinguish it from others, both similar and dissimilar, in order to determine how to deal with it appro- priately (vyāvṛttir vyavahāro vā lakṣaṇasya prayojanam). Taṭastha, extrinsic or incidental defining characteristics, are those that are identifiable as extraneous to the object being defined, which do not belong to its essential nature but by which it is commonly recog- nized. Svarupa characteristics are those that are part of the object itself, essential, and intrinsic to it.
The taṭastha characteristics of the jiva were given in SB 5.11.12, as cited in Anuccheda 1. There it was said that the jiva is condi- tioned by the mind and thus bound to the material world. The pure, unbound, unconditioned being is called the ātmā, whereas the con- ditioned being is called the jiva. The cause of conditioning is the beginningless ignorance (anadi avidya) of the self&rsquo;s real identity, or svarupa, which results in absorption in the mental modifications (citta-vṛtti). In this anuccheda, Śrī Jiva begins a description of the jiva&rsquo;s svarupa. Different schools of Indian philosophy have different concepts of the jiva. A summary of these views is presented here:

THE CARVĀKA, OR LOKAYATA, SCHOOL. There are no original works of this school available at present. Whatever is known about it is concluded from other schools who cite its views as pūrva-pakṣa and refute them. The Sarva-darśana-sangraha of Madhvācārya, a work belonging to the 14th century, provides a summary of the school in its first chapter. Prabodha-candrodaya (Act 2), an allegori- cal play, also depicts the salient features of the school. Şad-darśana- samuccaya, an eighth century work by Haribhadra Suri, also sum- marizes the doctrines of this school. Reference to Lokayata follow- ers is also found in the old works of Buddhism, such as Digha-nikāya (1) and Majjhima-nikaya (1). Bṛhaspati-sutra was supposed to be the original text of the Lokayata School.
289 The Carvaka School considers the body-mind complex itself to be the self. There is no ātmā, or self, separate from the body. Cārvāka holds that consciousness is an epiphenomenon, the out- come of the combination of material elements. They admit only four elements (tattva), namely, earth, water, fire, and air. It is a doctrine based exclusively on sensory data. Therefore, they do not acknowledge the existence of ether, the ātmā, and God. The elements are considered eternal but their combinations undergo different modifications and dissolution. Consciousness is a by- product of matter. It is produced when the elements combine into a particular coalescence, although the elements separately do not possess it, just as fermented yeast produces an intoxicating quality.
In the Carvāka realism, consciousness is observed to be associ- ated with the body, and it disappears when the body disintegrates. The ātmā is just the conscious living body. The pronoun &ldquo;I&rdquo; refers to the empirical self. One uses the pronoun &ldquo;I&rdquo; to refer to the gross physical body when one makes statements, such as, &ldquo;I am fat,&rdquo; &ldquo;I am thin,&rdquo; &ldquo;I am weak.&rdquo; This is because the body alone is the true self. As such, it is very dear to all beings, and they try to protect it

at any cost. A person can sacrifice anything for the sake of his body. It is also said: peitty

AdOne should abandon a family member to protect the whole family, sacrifice a family for the sake of a village, disown a village to safe- guard a district, but to protect the self (the ātmā), one should give up the whole earth. (Pañcatantra 1.386)&rdquo;
Be The Carvaka School avers that the word ātmā (self) in this verse is used for the body. According to Siddhi-traya (12) of Yamunacă- rya, there are various theories of ātmā within the Lokayata School. Some consider the ātmā as the gross body, others as the senses, the mind, or the vital air. Because we do not have access to the orig- inal works of the school, it is hard to say what exactly their view entailed. The knowledge we have is only from the works of other schools who may have addressed only the weakest points in their metaphysics with a view to refute them.

From the name Lokayata, it appears that their philosophy was materialism, like the modern scientists who treat consciousness as a by-product of the body. Dr. Radhakrishnana writes, &ldquo;Lokay- ata, directed to the world of sense, is the Sanskrit word for mate- rialism.&rdquo; The seed-conception of materialism can be found in the Upanisads. For example, the Taittiriya Upanisad says: &ldquo;Indeed, this body, made of the essence of food, is the self (atma)&rdquo; (TU 2.1.1)
In Bṛhad-aranyaka Upanisad, the sage Yajnavalkya says: &ldquo;A hus- band is not dear for the sake of the husband, but for the sake of the ātmā&rdquo; (BAU 2.4.5). According to the Carvāka School, the word ātmā here refers to the body of the husband because the wife loves the husband&rsquo;s body, not something invisible beyond the body. If one objects that the wife does not love the dead body of her husband,

Cārvāka replies that this is so only because the consciousness in the body ceases to function. Death for them means that conscious- ness, which is a by-product of the body, comes to an end. In Vişnu Purana (3.18.3-31), we find Mayamoha&rsquo;s instructions to the Daityas, which conform to materialism. Similar instances are found in Rāmāyaṇa and Mahabharata (Santi-parva). This philosophy of the atma&rsquo;s being equated with the body, the senses, the mind, or the vital air has been refuted in Tattva Sandarbha (Anucchedas 53-60).
BUDDHISM. Gautama Buddha, the founder of the school, does not make any definitive statement about the atma&rsquo;s existence. He spoke of five khandhas (skandhas), or aggregates, which constitute the body and mind of all sentient beings. The pronoun &ldquo;I&rdquo; may refer to any one of these or all of them collectively. These include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Rupa, or form, consisting of the four primary elements - earth, dial water, fire, and air-which provide corporeality to the body
and senses.</li>
<li>Vedana, or feelings, in the form of pleasure, pain, and indiffer- ence, arising out of contact with the five senses and the mind. 3. Sañña (sañjñā), or conceptual knowledge or perception, related
to the five senses and the mind.</li>
<li>Sankhāra (samskāra), or volitional states, in connection with Inform, sound, smell, taste, touch, and mental objects.</li>
<li>Vijñāna, or consciousness, also related to the five senses and the gamind.&rdquo;

As regards Buddha&rsquo;s view on the ātmā, Dr. Radhakrishnana writes:

The reason for Buddha&rsquo;s ambivalence in regard to the ātmā is that he disregarded the Vedic authority and sought to establish his path exclusively on the basis of experience and logic. However, the later followers of Buddha, like Nagarjuna, adopted a defini- tive stand on the atma&rsquo;s non-existence in exclusion of the five skandhas 13

There are various schools of Buddhism having different opin- ions about the objective world and its perceiver. One of the most popular is called Vijñānavāda or Yogacara, regarded as a form of subjective idealism. This doctrine holds that consciousness alone exists and fluctuates at every moment. Every phenomenal appear- ance is momentary. Everything that arises out of causes and con- ditions is necessarily impermanent. The preceding moment is the cause of the succeeding moment. Change is the law of the universe. External objects do not exist outside of thought, or ideation. The empirical ego is also unreal. The apparent objects of the world are like a river that flows constantly. There is nothing in the world that is not momentary. Consciousness manifests itself both as sub- ject as well as object. It arises out of its own seed and then mani- fests itself as an external object. Just as in a dream mental objects are projected out of one&rsquo;s own consciousness, so too in the waking state, empirical objects are but percepts projected out of the store of consciousness. There is neither subject nor object but only a succession of ideas.14
JAINISM. This school posits that in its pure state, the ātmā pos- sesses infinite perception, knowledge, bliss, and power. It is all- perfect and distinct from the body. The number of ātmās is infinite. The dimension of the self is considered to be neither atomic nor all- pervading. It is medium-sized and determined by the magnitude

of the body it inhabits. The ātmā occupies the whole of the body. It is of very small size when it originates in the womb but goes on expanding as the body grows in size. In each successive transmi- gration, a particular jiva contracts or expands in its magnitudinal proportions. A bound self is vitiated by subtle particles of fine mat- ter (karma) that accrue to a jīva due to its former actions and inten- tions. The means through which karma clings to the self is called āśrava, or the influx of karma-matter, which is the effect of bodily, verbal, and mental actions, and is the cause of bondage of the self. This bondage is beginningless.5
NYAYA-VAISEṢIKA. The schools of Nyaya and Vaiseṣika share a common view about the ātmā. They both claim that the ātmā is an eternal substance devoid of parts or divisions and bereft of consciousness. Consciousness, therefore, is an incidental quality of the ātmā that arises only when it is in contact with the mind. The ātmā is an all-pervading substance, the substratum of knowl- edge (jñāna), or consciousness, and is motionless. These schools do not distinguish between knowledge and consciousness. When a self becomes liberated, which means disconnected from the mind, it remains as an inert substance. The self is a real subject of experi- ence, a real knower, and a real agent. Each self has a manas (or psy- chic instrument) during its empirical existence and is separated from it in liberation. It is distinct from the body, the senses, and the mind.&rdquo; There is a separate ātmā in each body! Thus, there are an infinite number of ātmās.
MĪMĀMSĀ. There are two major schools of Mīmāmsā, one founded by Kumarila Bhaṭṭa and the other by Prabhakara. Both admit the plurality of individual beings and consider the self as an eternal, all-pervading substance that is the substratum of con- sciousness. The self is a real knower, the subject of experience, and an agent. It is distinct from the body, the senses, the mind, and

II The Ontology of the Jiva - Taṭastha-sakti
Prabhakara, like the Nyaya-Vaiseṣika School, accepts that the self is essentially unconscious. Consciousness is an incidental property of the self when it is in contact with the mind. Cognition, affect, volition, and agency are the properties of the self and arise due to merit and demerit in its conditioned state. In the liberated state, the self remains as a pure substance divested of its qualities, including consciousness and bliss.
HOL
Prabhakara says that the self is merely the substrate of the cog- nition, &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; but not as of the nature of consciousness. If the ātmā were of the nature of consciousness, it would result in the defect of consciousness being both support and supported, or in other words, subject and object. It is everyone&rsquo;s experience that subject and object are distinct from each other. Therefore, the ātmā must be different from consciousness, implying that it is non- conscious, since consciousness does not constitute its essence.
Kumārila Bhatta, however, accepts the ātmā as both partly con- scious and partly unconscious. He says that in deep sleep, there is both consciousness and unconsciousness. If all knowledge were lost during deep sleep, then one would not remember things on waking up. But such is not the case. Therefore, it must be accepted that there is a stable consciousness in deep sleep and this conscious- ness - when united with the impressions from past experiences makes us recognize and recollect. But like Prabhakara and the Nyaya-Vaiśeṣika, Kumārila too believes that in the liberated state, the self remains as a pure substance divested of its qualities of con- sciousness, agency, and bliss, though he adds that as in deep sleep, the self is then characterized by potential consciousness.99 28 YOGA AND SANKHYA. The schools of Yoga and Sankhya con- sider prakṛti (primordial nature) and puruşa (the conscious living being, or self) as the two fundamental principles of the cosmos. Puruşa is the principle of pure consciousness, distinct from mind, intellect, ego, body, and senses. It is not merely a substance that possesses consciousness as a quality. Rather, consciousness is its

very essence.20 It is the ultimate knower that is the foundation of all knowledge. It is the subject of knowledge and can never become its object. It is beyond time and space, and devoid of any activity or modification. It is eternal and all-pervading. Sankhya and Yoga believe in the plurality of purusas? Bliss is different from consciousness and is a product of sattva-guna (prityātmakaḥ sattva-gunah). Knowledge is a modification of the mind, called citta-vrtti?26 airboqmed to Wates altiinstababo
ADVAITA VEDANTA. Advaita Vedanta proclaims that the jiva is nondifferent from Brahman.23 However, this identity with Brahman is realized only when the jiva transcends the self- identification with its temporary phenomenal body-mind com- plex. The jiva is of the nature of consciousness, eternal, beginning- less, and indestructible. But this reality is the truth of the jiva as Brahman, and not as a separate and independent entity. There are different views among the Advaita scholars as to how Brahman comes to be identified as the jiva. The most prominent among them hold that the jiva is Brahman, either covered by, delimited by, or reflected, in ignorance.ly belWorks loodad
In his Brahma-sutra commentary (2.3.50), Sankara says, &ldquo;And the self is only the reflection of the higher atman.&ldquo;24 Later this concept became known as pratibimba-vada (&ldquo;the theory of reflec- tion&rdquo;) in the writings of Prakāśātmā and Vidyaranya. Sankara offers another explanation about the nature of the self while com- menting on Brahma-sutra (2.3.17). He gives the example of ākāśa (all-pervading space) being divided by various clay pots.25 As long

as the pots are present, the one ākāśa appears to be divided. If the pots are removed or broken, the initial unity of ākāśa is reinstated. Even when the pots were present, space was still only one, but it appeared as many in different pots. espoires bamboodiation AngIn the same way, the one Brahman becomes divided by avidya, or ignorance. There is only one reality, i.e., Brahman. Brahman or ātman delimited by upadhis is the jiva, who suffers and enjoys in accordance with its acts. When the upadhis are dissolved, the jiva is established in its supreme glory as Brahman, just as one sees a rope as it is when the illusion of its being a snake is dispelled (Brahma-sūtra, Śānkara-bhāṣya 1.3.19).26 This theory later became known as avaccheda-vada (&ldquo;the theory of limitation&rdquo;) in the writ- ings of Vacaspati Miśra. Brahman as well as the jiva, or individual self, is neither inert, nor temporary, nor miserable. It is devoid of agency, experiential capacity, and knowership (Brahma-sutra, Sankara-bhāṣya 2.3.40)27
The above views of the different schools may be summarized as follows. With the exception of Advaita Vedanta, all the other schools acknowledge a plurality of ātmās. Naiyāyikas, Vaiseṣikas, Sankhyaites, Yaugas, and Advaitavādīs accept the ātmā as all- pervading. The Cārvākas and Jains believe the ātmā to be medium- sized, i.e., as proportionate to the size of the body. Vaiṣṇava Vedanta concludes that the ātmā is atomic in size. Naiyāyikas and Vaiseṣikas accept agency in the ātmā, while Sänkhya and Yoga schools claim that agency is in prakṛti. Advaitavada avows that the ātmā has agency only because of the external imposition of adjuncts, or upadhis, i.e., in the conditioned state.

16619 Introduction to Jiva-tattva fin
because bhakti is not possible on the basis of the absolute iden- tity between the jiva and Brahman. It is, therefore, important to understand the position of Advaita Vedanta, which Śrī Jiva will attempt to refute. Since he does not state the opponent&rsquo;s view, we will give a brief summary here.
Advaita Vedanta accepts six elements as beginningless.28 These are the jiva, Iśvara, pure or para Brahman, māyā or avidya, the rela- tion of avidya to the jiva, and the relation of Isvara to avidya. Of these, Brahman and avidya are the main principles. An object that always exists in the past, present, and future is called sat, or real (Brahma-sutra, Sankara-bhāṣya 2.1.16). That which never exists is called asat, or unreal. Avidya, also called ajñāna or ignorance, is different both from sat (real) and asat (unreal). It consists of three gunas, i.e., sattva, rajas, and tamas. It has existence, but its exact nature cannot be specified?&rdquo; It has two divisions, collective and individual. When Brahman is limited by the collective form of avidya, it is called Iśvara or God, and when it is delimited by the individual avidya, it is called jiva.30
Some Advaita scholars say that māyā has two divisions, called māyā and avidyā. Māyā is predominant in pure sattva and avidya in impure sattva. Brahman reflected in maya is called Iśvara, and reflected in avidya is called jiva.2 Iśvara is the Supreme Controller, the creator of the universe and immanent in it. The jiva is limited in knowledge and under the control of Isvara. Some Advaita scholars accept only one jiva, while others accept a plurality33
A question may be raised, that if Brahman is a self-luminous, conscious being, then how can it lose its luminosity? Moreover,

II The Ontology of the Jiva - Taṭastha-sakti
if Brahman is untouched by anything and is indifferent, then how can it create the world? In response to this, Advaita Vedānta says that avidya has two potencies. One is the potency of concealment (avaraṇa-sakti) that covers the real nature of an object, and the other is the potency of projection (vikṣepa-sakti) that manifests var- ious avastava, or illusory, forms. These potencies of māyā have a beginningless relation with Brahman. Consequently, the potency of concealment veils the cit (consciousness) and ananda (bliss) fea- tures of Brahman, and the potency of projection manifests the phe- nomenal world appearance. The potency of concealment veils only the cit and ananda features of Brahman and not the sat feature (or the quality of existence). For this reason, the sat feature pervades all objects of the universe. This is experienced by us as &ldquo;the table exists, the chair exists,&rdquo; but we do not experience the pervasion of cit and ananda in the objects of the material world.
bien To One of the basic concepts used by Advaita Vedanta to explain the variety experienced by us in the temporal world, despite the unity of Ultimate Reality, is called the adhyāropa-vāda principle. Adhyäropa means superimposition of the non-real (avastu) on the real (vastu). Vastu is that which exists even when we are ignorant of it; avastu, on the other hand, exists only while we are aware of it. For example, to mistake a rope for a snake is an instance of adhya- ropa. In this example, the rope is the vastu, and the snake the avastu. The snake is superimposed onto the rope, so the rope exists even while misperceived as a snake, but the snake exists only as long as we superimpose &ldquo;snakeness&rdquo; upon the rope. When the mistake is corrected, one sees only the rope and not the snake.ind zooforo
34
The statement &ldquo;this is a rope,&rdquo; has two parts, i.e., &ldquo;this&rdquo; and &ldquo;a rope.&rdquo; When a rope is seen in semi-darkness and misperceived as a snake, the rope part of the perception is veiled by the covering potency of ajñāna (ignorance or misperception). The &ldquo;this&rdquo; part of the perception, however, is not veiled, meaning that there is indeed a phenomenal appearance (i.e., the object) present to the perceiv- ing subject. When we fail to perceive that the object present to

-19 Introduction to Jiva-tattva
awareness is in fact a rope and mistake it for a snake, we still experi- ence the &ldquo;this&rdquo; part of the perception. In that moment, the vikṣepa- śakti (the projective potency of ajñāna) produces the appearance of a snake, but the &ldquo;this&rdquo; part (i.e., the object present to awareness) continues to exist. Therefore, one says, &ldquo;This is a snake.&ldquo;ly sti This is analogous to Brahman and phenomenal objects. The potency of concealment covers the cit and ananda aspects of Brahman, but the sat feature continues. Then the vikṣepa-sakti projects the phenomenal objects and one experiences them as sat, or existent, but devoid of cit and ananda. baba aquagpipango
Advaita Vedanta posits three grades of existence (sattā), namely, päramärthika, or ontological reality, vyavahārika, or empirical reality, and pratibhāsika, or illusory reality5 Paramarthi- ka-satta can never be lost or negated. The vyavahārika-sattā is experienced in the empirical state of causally connected spatio- temporal existence, but it is sublated (i.e., set aside as false) in the päramärthika state of ultimate being. Empirical existence is visible in the pragmatic objects of our daily experience in the waking state. Material objects, which are effects of prior causes, are subject to destruction, but their existence, which inheres in their ultimate support (i.e., Brahman), is not sublated, badhita. Badha means the destruction of an effect along with its cause. In the course of the world manifestation, material objects are destroyed, but their ulti- mate cause, Brahman, is not destroyed. Therefore, they are called abadhya (non-sublatable). The pratibhāsika objects are abadhya only as long as they are misperceived as real, but they are negated as false, or badhita, at other times. When a rope that was previously misperceived as a snake is later correctly perceived as it is, then the illusory snake along with its cause, i.e., ignorance, is badhita, or negated.tem
Brahman is devoid of any qualities, parts, or divisions. When we see a rope, it is actually Brahman covered by the avaraṇa- śakti of ignorance and projected as a rope by the vikṣepa-sakti of ajñāna. This is vyavahārika-sattā, or empirical reality. When we perceive a snake in a rope, the avaraṇa-sakti conceals the rope

and the vikṣepa-sakti projects a snake. This is prātibhāsika-sattā, or illusory reality. Brahman concealed by the covering potency of ajñāna manifests as the jiva, or the individual being, and then it projects - upon the jiva - the characteristics of agency, expe- riential capacity, happiness, misery, delusion, and so on, by the vikṣepa-sakti of ajñāna. Thus, according to Advaita Vedanta, the jiva is not inherently endowed with (or constituted of) the capaci- ties of knowership, agency, experiential capacity, or qualia (indi- vidual instances of subjective, conscious experience). It is mere consciousness. Indeed, it is more appropriate to say that it is not
inert.
hoWith the exception of Advaita Vedanta, all the schools described above base their theories primarily on logic. Among them, Advaita Vedanta is the only school that interprets śabda (scriptural revela- tion), albeit wrongly, to establish its theory of atma. Besides the radical interpretation of Vedanta propounded by Sankarācārya, there are Vaisnava schools of Vedanta, such as Visiṣṭa-advaitavada of Śrī Rāmānujācārya, Dvaitavada of Sri Madhvacārya, Svabhävika- bheda-abheda of Śrī Nimbārkācārya, Suddha-advaitavada of Śrī Vallabhācārya, and Acintya-bheda-abhedavāda of Śrī Caitanya Mahaprabhu.
TedAll these Vaisnava schools consider the theories of the above schools as purva-paksa and refute them. There are two strategies to counter these theories. One is on the basis of logic alone and the other is through the authority of sabda assisted by logic. In Tattva Sandarbha (Anuccheda 11), Śrī Jiva Gosvāmi rejects the first option, because it is indecisive. He also states that in matters beyond sense perception, sabda is the sole means of valid knowing. More- over, even among the various scriptures accepted as śabda, Śrī Jiva argues in favor of Bhagavata Purana as the ultimate authority.
In Bhagavad Gitā (2.25), Bhagavan Krsna includes transrational- ity (acintyatva) as one of the characteristics of the ātmā. In light of this, Śrī Jiva adopts the second strategy to refute all of the opposi- tional theories of the diverse schools. Although not stated explic- itly, his main opponent is Advaitavada. There are two reasons for this. The first is that Advaitavada bases its theories on the
170
Fl-19 Introduction to Jiva-tattva s
same scriptural revelation (i.e., the Upanisads, the Gītā, and the Brahma-sutra). Thus, it is necessary to point out the limitations and defects in the Advaitavada interpretation in order to establish the real intent of scripture. The second reason is that Advaitavada has done an effective job of refuting the other schools. Consequently, if Advaitavada is refuted, all other views stand defeated. This is known as the principle of conquering the ace wrestler, pradhana- malla-barhana-nyaya.orist bas amulos fial sdt i borail 915
In addition to Śrī Jiva Gosvāmi&rsquo;s elaboration of the intrinsic characteristics of the jiva based on Jāmātṛ Muni&rsquo;s verses, Anucche- das 37-44 concentrate on the nature of the jiva as an integrated part of Paramātmā and on the jiva&rsquo;s oneness with and distinc- tion from Paramātmā. Anucchedas 45-47 present various other characteristics of the jiva.
Śrī Jiva Gosvāmī begins discussing sequentially the intrinsic qualities of the ātmā listed by Jāmātṛ Muni. He does so by cit- ing evidence from Bhāgavata Purana. Of these characteristics, the first, that the ātmā is not a god, a human, or any other species of life, mentioned in the first half of Jāmātṛ&rsquo;s first verse, was implied in Tattva Sandarbha (Anuccheda 54). In this connection, the verse cited by Jiva Gosvāmī (SB 11.3.39) clearly states that the ātmā is dis- tinct from the physical body, being free from modifications and the witness of deep sleep. It is the physical body that assumes various appellations of a deva, a human being, an animal, or an immovable being, such as a tree. For an elaborate explanation of this verse, one should read the commentary on it given in Tattva Sandarbha.
The second characteristic, mentioned in the second half of Jāmātṛ&rsquo;s first verse, that the ātmā is distinct from the body, the senses, the mind, and the vital air, is confirmed by Śrī Kṛṣṇa (SB 11.10.8). He gives the example of fire and wood. Fire is hid- den in wood, but when wood is ignited, fire becomes visible and burns the wood. One can understand from this that fire is dis- tinct from wood. In the same way, the ātmā illuminates the body, the mind, and so on, while remaining invisible. Being inert, the psycho-somatic instruments cannot function without the ātmā. If the ātmā becomes aware of its true nature, it not only illuminates

We have inserted the following chart below for consultation purposes and for the reader&rsquo;s information. It may be observed that many of the verses offered as pramāņa repeat many of the same characteristics, e.g., &ldquo;witness,&rdquo; etc. The intrinsic qualities of the jiva (or the ātmā), as given in the four verses of Jāmātṛ Muni, are listed in the left column, and their corresponding anuccheda headings and numbers appear on the right.

But the transcendence [turiyatva] found in Paramātmā is alto- gether of a different category from that belonging to the jiva [which is also of &ldquo;the fourth state,&rdquo; i.e., transcendence, since it is distinct from the three conditional states], as indicated in the following statement:
Virāt, Hiranyagarbha, and Karana are the three limiting adjuncts (upādhis) of God in His capacity as the Supreme Immanent (Iśvara). But He who is free from these is called Turiya, the fourth dimension, or in other words, the Supreme Transcendence. (Bhāvärtha-dipikā 11.15.16)3 navagedale om

17620 The Jiva Is Not Inert
jiva is a conscious being. While one is awake or dreaming, the mind undergoes modifications according to the external or internal experience. This modification of mind is called a vṛtti. plno vlage
In deep sleep, the subtle and gross senses are inactive, and thus there is no vṛtti formed in the buddhi. In that state there is no aware- ness of oneself as happy or miserable, male or female, or any sen- sations from the outside world. This lack of any specific vṛtti is also called suşupti-vṛtti, or the mental state in which there is non- occurrence of other mental phenomena. In that state there is only the self-awareness of &ldquo;I,&rdquo; which is also inexpressible because of the absolute unawareness of anything else. &ldquo;I&rdquo;-consciousness (or in other words, subject-consciousness) has relevance only in relation to objects, or &ldquo;non-I.&rdquo; Upon awakening the remembrance comes, &ldquo;I slept well.&rdquo; This remembrance is possible only if the person who remembers has experienced a refreshing sleep, the suşupti-vṛtti. This means that even in deep sleep the witness of sleep is present. From this Śrī Jiva Gosvāmi concludes that the jiva is distinct from the three states of buddhi and is thus called turiya, or &ldquo;the fourth.&rdquo;
Bhagavan Vasudeva is also called Turiya, not only because He too is transcendental to material nature, but also because He occu- pies the fourth position (turya-kakṣa), of non-involvement with upādhis, among the members of Svayam Bhagavan&rsquo;s quadruple expansions (catur-vyuha). He is thus beyond the three puruṣāvată- ras, namely, Kāraṇodakaśāyī, Garbhodakaśāyi, and Kṣirodakaśāyi Visņu. As such, He is the source of these three puruşăvatāras.
The verse referred to from the Bhāvārtha-dipikā is also cited twice in Bhagavat Sandarbha. As it relates to the present discus- sion, we include here an excerpt from the commentary to Bhagavat Sandarbha, Anuccheda 4:
This Bhagavan is called Turiya (lit., &ldquo;the fourth&rdquo;), because He is free from any limiting adjuncts, or upadhis, which are of three types, as given in a verse quoted in Bhavärtha-dipikā 11.15.16: &ldquo;Virat, Hiranyagarbha, and Kāraṇa are the three limiting adjuncts (upadhis) of God in His capacity as the Supreme Immanent, but He who is free from these is called Turiya, the fourth dimension, or in other words, the Supreme Transcendence.&rdquo;
177
II The Ontology of the Jiva - Taṭastha-sakti
bai Virat is the gross upadhi, Hiranyagarbha the subtle upadhi, and Karana is māyā (the causal upadhi). These three restrictions apply only to the Puruşa manifestations, who are known as Kṣiro- dakaśāyi, Garbhodakaśāyī, and Karaṇodakaśāyī Visņus, respec- tively. But Bhagavan, replete with six opulences, is beyond these three upadhis.

II The Ontology of the Jiva - Taṭastha-sakti
WE SEE THE MOON waxing and waning, but in reality the moon does not wax or wane. Similarly, only the body undergoes various changes, beginning with birth and culminating in death, but not the jiva. That the jiva is unchanging is corroborated by our personal experience of being the same person throughout childhood, adoles- cence, youth, and maturity, even though the body has undergone changes.blema vellir).
Time is here called avyakta-vartma, or that whose path is unmanifest. This means that we do not directly perceive the move- ment of time, but only infer its existence from the changes it brings about. We have no sense faculty that allows for the direct percep- tion of time, but we account for it by seeing change or movement in some object, such as the movement of the sun or a change in one&rsquo;s own body. In truth, time does not move. It only effects changes in matter, which give us the sense of its movement, just as when sit- ting in a departing train the platform appears to be moving when it is only the train that moves. Time is one of the general causes behind all actions or changes. Damit a home

Śrī Jiva refers to the moon as being fluid, or watery, in nature (jala-maya). This is the belief of Indian Jyotish, or astronomy, though not supported by modern scientific finding. One of the names of the moon in Sanskrit is abja (Amarakośa 1.3.14), which lit- erally means &ldquo;water-born.&rdquo; According to the popular myth of the churning of the ocean, samudra-manthana, the moon was one of the objects extracted from the churning of the sea (Mahābhārata, Adi-parva 18.37). Thus, the moon is believed to be watery, and it reflects the sun&rsquo;s rays, which make it look effulgent.il or theftsy to In the next section, Śri Jiva will describe that the ātmā is not mere consciousness. boghalimiz 3lati noom ons lo idgword,smols vbod adilo era dissb diw galbas bas drild driw ad tous bidw to sexpos mit lo sgrassg sdr yd Juods An ars of mistr9qge zon ob hns,bonists9026

IT WAS SAID EARLIER by Jāmātṛ Muni, &ldquo;The ātmā is not mere consciousness&rdquo; [jñāna-mātrātmako na ca, quality no.5]. What exactly does this mean? It means that even while being purely of the nature of consciousness, the jiva has the capacity to know (jñāna-śaktitva), just as light, which is itself luminous, also has the power to illuminate [other objects]. This was demon- strated by the following verse, quoted in the Tattva Sandarbha (Anuccheda 53):
नात्मा जजान न मरिष्यति नैधतेऽसौ न क्षीयते सवनविद् व्यभिचारिणां हि । सर्वत्र शश्वदनपाय्युपलब्धिमात्रं प्राणो यथेन्द्रियबलेन विकल्पितं सत् ।। १११ ।।
Because it is the witness of the variable states [childhood, youth, and so on] of the transient material body, this ātmā is with- out birth, growth, decay, or death. Although the ātmā is exclu- sively of the nature of consciousness, present everywhere, eter- nal, and invariable, it appears to assume various forms under the influence of sense perception and cognition, just as the vital asforce (prāna) within the body, although one, appears as if manyd (in contact with the various senses.

It is perfectly clear from the above that the self has such power of knowing, because the verse says that although the ātmā is exclusively of the nature of consciousness (upalabdhi-matra), it is a knower, or witness, of the variable states of the transient material body (savana-vit). Therefore, it was said, &ldquo;[The knower of the presentational field], being pure, merely perceives [these beginningless modifications] of the impure actor&rdquo; (SB 5.11.12)?

In this verse, by the words &ldquo;upon seeing,&rdquo; &ldquo;bewildered,&rdquo; and &ldquo;by the power to conceal consciousness,&rdquo; the self&rsquo;s knowing capacity (jñāna) is understood as interior to its being (pratyag- bhūta) and hence distinct from prakṛti and her self-generated ignorance, which [by contrast] is external to the self (parag- bhūtāyāḥ). It can thus be deduced that the self&rsquo;s knowing capac- ity must be a function of its own innate power (svarupa-sakti)

Commentary

and sroterad:
brow adl
NAIYAYIKAS ACCEPT that the jiva is eternal, but not that it is inher- ently endowed with the quality of consciousness. They claim that consciousness appears only when the jiva is associated with the mind. When a jiva becomes liberated, dissociating permanently from the mind, it becomes devoid of consciousness. Sankhya, on the other hand, accepts consciousness as the inherent nature of the jiva, but not agency, kartṛtva. According to them, agency belongs to prakṛti. padura
mi
Advaita Vedāntis affirm that the jiva is consciousness alone. They do not consider consciousness to be a quality that the self, as substrate, possesses. Śrī Jīva, while still referring to Jāmātṛ Muni&rsquo;s verses [in Anuccheda 19 above] and the Padma Purāṇa, says that the jiva is not mere consciousness, but also the possessor of the power to know. It has jñāna-sakti, or cognitive potency; it is savana-vit, or the knower of temporal changes. In support of this, Śrī Jīva cites Śrimad Bhagavatam (11.3.38), spoken by the sage Pippalāyana to King Nimi.
The word jñāna is commonly translated as knowledge, but that is not the only meaning it carries. It will be helpful especially in this context to understand its various meanings. The word jñāna is derived from the verbal root √jñā, meaning &ldquo;to know,&rdquo; by applying the lyut suffix. One can derive three senses by applying lyut:

ajñānenävṛtaṁ jñānam tena muhyanti jantavah
See Panini&rsquo;s Aṣṭādhyayi (3.3.115), lyuț ca, &ldquo;The affix lyut is added to the root when the action is denoted in the neuter gender.&rdquo; And PANINI 3.3.117,
karaṇa-adhikaranayos ca, &ldquo;The affix lyut occurs after a root when a word&rsquo;s relation with the verb denotes instrumentality or location&rdquo; (translations based on Vasu 1894: 525-6). Commentators note that the last two are the instrumental cand locative cases, respectively. Jiva Gosvāmi calls the same suffix tan in

(21.3 AriD) It is perfectly clear from the above that the self has such power The word jñāna, therefore, has three etymological meanings: a is exclusively of the nature of consciousnem (upainiestremo 11.

Jñāna in this sense implies a subject that possesses of content-knowledge, or the one in whom cognitions reside.
ebA
of vadr Advaitavada accepts only the first meaning of jñāna in relation to the self. According to them, the true nature of the self is con- tentless awareness, which reveals the subject alone without any object. The Bhāgavatam&rsquo;s view of the conscious nature of Bhaga- vän (specified as advaya-jñāna in SB 1.2.11) and that of the individ- ual self corresponds to the third definition of jñāna, since cognition inheres in both of them as a natural or innate feature of their being. This condition also entails the existence in them of knowledge as an instrument of cognizing objects, the second definition stated above. On this view, knowledge as an instrument is operative in the form of mental states (jñāna-vṛtti), whereas knowledge as the substratum, or that in which knowing inheres, refers to what Śrī Jiva Gosvāmi means by jñāna-svarupa, the subject&rsquo;s innate capac- ity for knowledge, i.e., its capacity or qualitative potential to appre- hend. Thus, in his view the third meaning of jñāna refers to the essential nature of the self, whereas the second meaning indicates its quality (guna), which manifests when the self is conjoined to the body-mind complex.
We are using the word guna (quality) loosely here. The relation between the self and its jñāna-vṛtti is similar to that of a magnet
184
22 The Jiva Is Not Mere Consciousness
and the movement it induces in iron shavings. This relation can- not be precisely defined in terms of any of the categories of conven- tional relations postulated in Nyaya, such as of contact or inher- ence, because mental states (jñāna-vṛrtti) are external to the self, like the movements of iron fillings.f
In summary, when Advaitavādīs use the word jñāna-svarupa, they have in mind the first meaning of jñāna, whereas Jiva Gosvāmi has in mind the third meaning. From the point of view of linguistic interpretation, one might say that the fundamental difference in ideology between Śrī Jīva Gosvāmī and Advaitavada is in the appli- cation of the affix lyut as adhikarana (the substratum) versus bhāva (verbal activity). For Śrī Jīva, knowledge thus belongs to a subject, and it is &ldquo;content-filled,&rdquo; meaning that it has reference to an object. Knowledge in the second sense, of mental states (jñāna-vṛtti), how- ever, is simply a fluctuation of psychic matter, or in other words, the inert functioning of mind-matter occurring in the embodied
state.
In the main verse of this anuccheda (SB 3.26.5), Bhagavan Kapila uses the phrases vilokya mumuhe, &ldquo;upon seeing, the jiva is bewil- dered,&rdquo; and jñāna-guhaya, &ldquo;by that which conceals self-awareness.&rdquo; These phrases indicate that the jiva must have the innate capacity to know, since it would be impossible to cover this capacity if it did not priorly exist. Matter is inert (parag-bhūta), whereas the jiva is conscious (pratyag-bhuta)&rsquo; by its very nature. But in the condi- tioned state, even while the jiva&rsquo;s intrinsic capacity to know things in general is present, it does not extend to the point of true self- knowledge or unmediated awareness of God. Such transcenden- tal knowledge in potentia is covered by ignorance, while the jiva&rsquo;s cognitive capacity is limited to the knowing of phenomena, be they external objects, or internal perceptions, or feelings. In Bhagavad Gītā (5.15), Śrī Kṛṣṇa says that the jñāna of the jiva is covered by ajñāna, and thus the jiva is bewildered. Once again, jñāna here ambalworl to smol avalotuniged zid

II The Ontology of the Jiva - Taṭastha-sakti
means the jiva&rsquo;s inherent cognitive potency to know things as they
are.
An objection may be raised here. How can the jiva&rsquo;s inherent cognitive potency be covered? Even if it is covered, it cannot be lost to the self, otherwise there is no sense in calling it a natural or inherent power. In response, one can say that if sugar is mixed with mud, it will not taste sweet. Still, this does not mean that the sugar has lost its sweetness. If sugar were a conscious being, it would still know itself to be sweet although mixed with mud. nominal -ilq Another example is that if a light bulb is covered by an opaque screen, the bulb will not have lost its luminosity even if very little light can be seen. If it were a conscious being, it would know itself to be as luminous as it was when not covered. The covering of the bulb alters only the perception of external perceivers. Similarly, if the jiva is naturally endowed with jñāna, or awareness, then even if it is covered by ignorance, it cannot become ignorant of itself as a knowing or conscious being. Moreover, ignorance is like darkness whereas jñāna is like light. Since darkness has no power to cover light, how then can ignorance veil awareness?asing loftranery
In response, it is said that this covering is possible because of the inconceivable power of maya, or the extrinsic potency (bahiranga-sakti) of Bhagavan, and that this covering has no begin- ning. Therefore, while commenting on the above-mentioned Gitā verse, Śrī Baladeva Vidyabhuṣaṇa writes that ignorance (ajñāna) is anadi, beginningless, and it assumes the form of directing atten- tion away from the Absolute, vaimukhya. The covering of con- sciousness means that the awareness (jñāna) of the jiva, though eternal (nitya), becomes unmanifest (anadi-tad-vaimukhyena ajñā- nena jīvānāṁ nityam api jñānam avṛtam tirohitam). In other words, in the conditioned state, the jiva lacks inherent awareness of its own svarupa, of Bhagavan, and of their relation. This lack of aware- ness has no beginning, but it can come to end when the self is surrendered to Bhagavan. This beginningless lacuna of knowledge is called &ldquo;the covering of knowledge by ignorance.&rdquo;
The phrase, &ldquo;the covering of knowledge&rdquo; (jñānam āvṛtam), should not be taken in the literal sense of concealing self-knowledge
18622 The Jiva Is Not Mere Consciousness
or God-knowledge that was originally present prior to the cov- ering. Rather, because this covering is beginningless, it refers instead to the as yet unbroken continuity of the absence of such truth-knowing. One may accordingly ask, &ldquo;Then why not sim- ply admit that the jiva is devoid of self-awareness?&rdquo; If, however, it were stated as such, the doubt would remain whether the jiva could acquire intrinsic self-knowing at all. If it could acquire self- knowing, then this capacity, being newly generated, would become an incidental quality. This is unacceptable, as it contradicts scrip- tural statements that affirm that the ātmā is conscious by nature. If, on the other hand, the jiva could not acquire self-awareness, then it would be reduced to an inert object, as is postulated by the Naiyayikas. For this reason, the word &ldquo;covering&rdquo; is used, which implies that the jiva is conscious by nature.
Therefore, Śrī Jiva Gosvāmī writes in Bhakti Sandarbha (Anucche- da 1): &ldquo;Although purely conscious by nature, the jiva&rsquo;s knowledge of its own intrinsic nature is covered by Bhagavan&rsquo;s extrinsic potency, Māyā, because she finds in the jiva the defect of obliviousness to Him, in the form of beginningless ignorance of the Absolute Real- ity.&rdquo; That the jiva is intrinsically endowed with the power of know- ing is a crucial principle in Vaisnava theology. More broadly, it is one of the major points of contention between theistic Vedāntists and non-theistic Vedāntists. Therefore, Śrī Jiva continues to stress it in the next three sections.

Subsequently, it adopts a suitable form (sarūpatām), indicating that it takes on their nature and char- acteristics. Thus, its good fortune is lost (apeta-bhaga), which am dyrtom),

23 The Jiva Has Potencies in addition to Jñāna
means that its [intrinsic] qualities, such as bliss (ānanda), are obscured, and it suffers death, signifying that it is subjected to the cycle of birth and death.&rdquo;
Anuccheda 24 Commentary
The Jiva&rsquo;s Potericy Is Intrinsic
JÑANA, OR THE CAPACITY TO KNOW, is not the only inherent potency of the jiva. It also has experiential capacity, which fur- ther implies agency. Śrī Jīva Gosvāmī cites the Śrutis&rsquo; prayers from the Bhāgavatam to make these potencies apparent. It is pre- cisely because the jiva has these capacities in its very nature that it can become identified with the empirical body-mind, becoming &ldquo;outward-oriented&rdquo; toward enjoyment of the world. Since empiri- cal identification is the common experience of humanity, it stands to reason that the jiva cannot be mere consciousness alone. If such were the case, then the jiva, being utterly transcendent of all phenomena, and being devoid of the powers of cognition, experi- ential capacity, and agency, would have no faculties whatsoever by which to become identified with phenomena or even to experience an empirical world at all.
In the quoted verse, the Śrutis say that the jiva in the condi- tioned state is apeta-bhaga, it has lost its good fortune or opulence, which implies that the jiva&rsquo;s other inherent śaktis, such as bliss and agency, are also concealed. According to Śrīdhara Svāmi, this means that the natural bliss (ānanda) of the jiva has been obscured because of its association with māyā. As it was argued in the pre- vious commentary, the loss or covering of jñāna indicates that the jiva is intrinsically endowed with the capacity for self-awareness, even though that capacity remains unactualized while steeped in beginningless ignorance. Similarly, the obscuration of its inher- ent opulence (apeta-bhaga) implies that the jiva is intrinsically endowed with other capacities, such as the experiential capacity for bliss, although such innate capabilities remain unpotentiated at present. This view stands in contrast to Advaitavada, which

Māyā is like an adulterous wife in whose association the living entity has lost its glory (aiśvarya), namely, some portion of its capacities, such as its own innate awareness. The word samsa- ranta here means the one who continuously follows her move- ments. This refers to the jiva, or in other words, the living entity in its own essential nature. So the jiva is the implied object of the relation expressed by the word abudhasya - of he who is

Commentary
abadapun A
THE VERSE IN THIS SECTION is spoken by the Haryaśvas, the sons of Dakṣa who performed penances to beget children, as ordered by their father. From the verse it is clear that some portion of the jiva&rsquo;s innate power is lost as long as it remains subdued by Māyā. For such power to be lost means that it must be priorly existent as unmanifested inherent potential. One cannot lose something with- out possessing it in the first place. Again, it has to be born in mind that this loss is in actuality the beginningless non-potentiation of such capacity. Thus, all it implies is that the jiva has such potential within its nature.
Though the word samsaranta in the verse carries the added sense of &ldquo;transmigrating through the various species birth after birth,&rdquo; it should be read here as syntactically connected with the word abudhasya. The jiva is unaware of both its true identity and true capacities as an eternal spiritual being, and at the same time is unaware that it is bound by material nature, following its desires like a hapless man besotted by a beautiful but fickle wife. Māyā is often likened to an enticing woman who holds a man under her thrall, simply because such attraction is the most powerful force by which the conditioned self is bound by the material energy. A variant on the same example is given in Anuccheda 25 below. Jes

THE WORD ISVARA is generally used for Paramātmā, or the Sup- reme Immanent Self. In this verse, it has been used instead for the jiva. It is formed by applying the varac suffix in the sense of &ldquo;having the nature of&rdquo; to the root √is (to rule, command, or govern). Consequently, the word isvara refers to one in whom there exists a natural capacity or a qualitative disposition to control, rule, com- mand, or govern. In this verse, the jiva is also called isvara, which

signifies that it has some power to control (e.g., the body, senses, and so on) and thus has power to act and to know; so, the jiva is not without potencies of its own. In spite of this, it becomes con- trolled by māyā and is thus not an omnipotent Iśvara like Param- ātmā, who is always free from Maya&rsquo;s influence and is her con- troller. Śrī Jiva comments, therefore, that the jiva has only some power, meaning &ldquo;a little&rdquo; (kiñcit), and not unlimited powers, as is the case with Paramātmā? Their father From the

II The Ontology of the Jiva - Taṭastha-sakti
Regarding the jiva&rsquo;s being intrinsically endowed with potency (śakti), the following sutra should also be considered: &ldquo;By the will of Bhagavan (para), however, [the jiva&rsquo;s intrinsic qualities] are obscured, because from Him proceed the self&rsquo;s bondage and liberation&rdquo; (vs 3.2.5).3

THE VERSE CITED HERE is part of an instruction that Narada imparts to King Pracinabarhi. By way of an allegorical tale, Närada explains the nature of the jiva and its bondage in the material body. In the allegory, the jiva is compared to a king, called Purañjana, whereas the intellect (buddhi) is likened to his queen, called Puran- jani. That the jiva is depicted as a king implies that it has some power to control and is a sort of ruler, or isvara, an adjective used for the jiva in the verse from the previous anuccheda. When, how- ever, the jiva identifies with the intellect, which gives rise to the notions of &ldquo;I&rdquo; and &ldquo;mine,&rdquo; he behaves just like a husband who is fully under the control of his wife. This is summed up in Narada&rsquo;s own words:

TO CLARIFY the above meaning [i.e., that the ātmā is not mere consciousness but also intrinsically endowed with cognitive awareness] Jāmātṛ Muni [Anuccheda 19] said, &ldquo;It is conscious of itself and self-luminous&rdquo; [svasmai svayam-prakāśaḥ syat, qual- ities no. 6 and 7]. The self&rsquo;s characteristic of self-luminosity was expressed [also in Anuccheda 19] by the word sva-drk (&ldquo;self- aware&rdquo;) in Bhagavatam (11.10.8) [the principal verse of that section]. ww Puranjahi

Luminosity (prakāśa) is of two kinds, based on the distinction made between luminosity as a quality (guna) and a luminous substance (dravya). The first kind of luminosity is that which makes visible the source of its own luminosity; the second kind is the specific [luminous] entity (vastu) itself that is instrumen- tal in making itself and other objects visible.

27 The Jiva Is Conscious of Itself n
In this particular instance, since the ātmā is accepted as a sub- stance (dravya), only the latter type of luminosity is applicable. For example, a lamp, in illuminating the eye, makes both itself and other objects visible of its own accord, without dependence on another light to reveal it, as would be the case for a clay pot. Therefore, the lamp is [called] self-luminous (svayam-prakāśa). It is not, however, self-revealing in regard to itself, and thus it is said to be inert or unconscious (jada).
आत्मा तु स्वं परं च प्रकाशयन् स्वात्मानं प्रति प्रकाशमानत्वात् स्वस्मै स्वयम्प्रकाशः । यत एव चिद्रूप उच्यते ।
hghast ei
The ātmā, on the other hand, illuminates both itself and others, but since it is also self-revealing in regard to its own self [i.e., because it is self-aware], it was said that it is &ldquo;self-illuminating of its own self&rdquo; (svasmai svayam-prakāśaḥ) - or in other words, self-aware and self-luminous. For this reason, it is said to be inherently of the nature of consciousness (cid-rupa)!

In regard to the second definition, it is evident that a lamp and other similar luminous objects are perceptible (vedya), which violates the definition. Hence, the word svasmai is needed to clarify the meaning of the word that succeeds it (svayam-prakāśa). Therefore, the word sva-drk (self-aware) means svasmai svayam-prakāśaḥ (self-revealing in regard to its own self).

IN THIS SECTION, Śrī Jīva Gosvāmī elaborates on the meaning of the words svasmai, svayam, and prakāśa, which appear in the second half of the second verse of Jämätṛ Muni quoted in Anuccheda 19. Svasmai means &ldquo;to oneself&rdquo; and svayam-prakāśa means &ldquo;self-luminous.&rdquo; Together these words signify that which is self-luminous and self-aware. The word prakāśa, which literally means &ldquo;light,&rdquo; can refer either to the quality of illumination or to the luminous object itself. As a quality, luminosity is that which illumines or reveals its own source. As a luminous object, it is instrumental in revealing itself and other objects, as a light bulb reveals itself to the eye and also illuminates objects in its vicinity.
A light bulb, therefore, is self-luminous, svayam-prakāśa; whereas, objects like a table or book need a light source to be seen by the eye. Therefore, they are not self-luminous. But a light bulb is not self-aware, therefore Śrī Jiva calls it &ldquo;inert.&rdquo; The ātmā, how- ever, is not only self-luminous but also self-aware. Furthermore, the ātmā illuminates itself and other objects, and it is also con- scious of itself. This is indicated by the word svasmai. For this
200

reason, the ātmā is called cid-rupa, or inherently of the nature of
consciousness.
Śrī Jiva Gosvāmī cites the definition of svayam-prakāśa given by Citsukhācārya, a famous Advaitavadi of the 13th century CE. Cit- sukha begins his book called the Tattva-pradipika with the ques- tion: &ldquo;What is the meaning of the term svayam-prakāśa?&rdquo; He pro- vides eleven definitions and then refutes them one by one, show- ing that only the last one is flawless. Of the eleven, Śrī Jiva has here cited the ninth and eleventh definitions. In the last definition given by Citsukhācārya, the word yogyatva (capability) replaces the word vişayatva (objectivity) of the tenth definition, emphasizing that a self-luminous entity is capable of making itself visible but not in the way that an object is visible to the perceiver. Since the last defi- nition is an improvement upon the tenth, Śrī Jiva has not taken the latter into consideration. In addition, he has somewhat modified the ninth. Using these two definitions of svayam-prakāśa, Śrī Jīva explains the necessity of the word svasmai used in connection with svayam-prakāśa in Jāmātṛ Muni&rsquo;s verses.

According to Tarka-sangraha, a definition is susceptible to three types of defects:

If a definition applies only to some members of a class to be defined, while excluding others, it is underextended (avyäpti). For example, if one defines &ldquo;man&rdquo; as a being with two legs and black hair, this would exclude men with blond hair. If a definition applies not only to all members of a class to be defined but to non- members also, then it is overextended (ativyapti). For example, if one defines &ldquo;man&rdquo; as a being with two hands, this would include monkeys, etc. If a definition is not applicable to any member of a

class, then it entails impossibility (asambhava). For example, if one defines &ldquo;man&rdquo; as a being with three legs, this is the defect called asambhava. A flawless definition must be free from these three defects.d
Śrī Jiva argues above that if the word svasmai is not used along with svayam-prakāśa, then the term self-luminous could apply to a light bulb, which is the defect of ativyapti. If the first definition (&ldquo;not dependent on any other source for illumination&rdquo;) is adopted, this can also apply to a lamp because we do not need another light source to see a lamp. Therefore, the word svasmai needs to be added to svayam-prakāśa. He she 10 (vissa)
In the second of Citsukha&rsquo;s definitions of svayam-prakasa, there are two stipulations: It should be avedyatva, or &ldquo;imperceptible,&rdquo; and aparokṣa-vyavahara-yogyatva, or &ldquo;capable of being immedi- ately, or directly, realized.&rdquo; If the literal meaning of avedyatva, as &ldquo;unknowable,&rdquo; were intended, then it would contradict the second condition, since anything that is unknowable cannot be directly perceived. But in Advaita Vedanta, the term avedyatva is used in the specific sense of &ldquo;uncognizable through external sense perception.&rdquo;
ad prakása, the In Advaita Vedanta, &ldquo;perception&rdquo; (pratyakṣa) is understood as having two parts: vṛtti-vyāpyatva and phala-vyapyatva? The first of these is described as follows: When the eyes come in contact with a sense object, it is inferred that the antah-karana (the inter- nal organ), which is accepted as a luminous instrument, flows out through the eyes to reach the object. This mental luminous instrument envelops the object of vision, taking on its shape or form. This modification of the antaḥ-karana, or citta, in the form of the object of perception is called a vṛtti, or &ldquo;mental modifica- tion.&rdquo; The enveloping of the object by the internal organ is called vṛtti-vyäpyatva.
In the second part of perception, the all-pervading conscious- ness (i.e., Brahman) reflects in the vṛtti, and this reflection is called cid-abhāsa or phala. So, the vṛtti removes the covering of the object of perception and the phala illuminates the object. This leads to
3
Vedanta-sära 29; Pañcadasi 7.91-92

Bolt 27 The Jiva Is Conscious of Itself!!!
perception of the object by the eye. The same process occurs when we perceive a suitable object with any one of the five external senses. The illumination of an object by phala is called vedyatva (perceptibility or knowability).
In regard to the direct realization of the atma, the citta takes the shape of the ātmā. This atma-vṛtti destroys the covering of the ātmā, but since the ātmā is self-luminous, there is no need for phala to illuminate it. Thus, the ātmā, although capable of being real- ized directly (aparokṣa-vyavahara-yogyatva), is said to be unknow- able (avedyatva), meaning &ldquo;it is not an object of external sense perception.&rdquo; According to this definition of svayam-prakāśa, the first stipulation of imperceptibility (avedyatva) excludes inert self- luminous objects, such as a lamp, and thus one may say that this particular definition doesn&rsquo;t necessitate the addition of the word svasmai to qualify svayam-prakāśa. But in the case of Jāmātṛ Muni&rsquo;s verses, Śrī Jiva Gosvāmī insists that svasmai must be used to make the meaning of svayam-prakāśa clear. In other words, if Citsukha&rsquo;s second definition were accepted as the meaning of the term svayam- prakāśa, there would be really no need to add the word svasmai to it. Yet, in the case of Jāmātṛ Muni&rsquo;s verses, Śrī Jiva is not being redundant, because svasmai has been used to make explicit that svayam-prakāśa does not mean a self-luminous inert object.

In its usage here, it implies a universal, intelligent, personal order behind the operation of natural and moral laws (dharma). In this view, natural and moral laws do not operate mechanically or unintelligently, but have behind them devas, or universal &ldquo;facilitators&rdquo; of the law. So, &ldquo;deistic encoding&rdquo; refers S primarily to the initiative, administered by a deva, of formatting experience in Df such a way that subject, object, and environment can function as a synthetic

Vikalpa (manifoldness) means difference, and the intelligence [or discriminatory capacity] spoken of is that which is related to difference. The great variety [of these differences] is elab- orated in the second half of the first of these verses where it is said, &ldquo;[the psycho-somatic organism] is subject to many kinds of modifications.&rdquo; So, although it undergoes innumerable modifications, they are broadly speaking of three categories.

In the same way, just as the sun, the &ldquo;self&rdquo; of the solar system, is independently self-revealing, so too is the ātmā. To indicate this, [Bhagavan Śrī Kṛṣṇa] says &ldquo;because,&rdquo; i.e., by virtue of the above example, the ātmā, which is different from and prior to these, being the support and foundation of the adhyatma, adhibhūta, and adhidaiva correlatives, is also independently self-revealing. The ātmā, however, is unique because of its conscious nature, as indicated by the words &ldquo;through its own immediate experien- tial or conscious capacity&rdquo; (svaya anubhutya). And this is not all; rather, the ātmā is that by which the actualization of the poten- tials of all interdependent categories [of the psycho-somatic organism] is enabled.

Śri Jiva said that the jiva is self-luminous, which means that it is not dependent upon another source for its revelation or realization, just as we do not need another light bulb to see a luminated light bulb. A doubt may be raised about this definition of the jiva&rsquo;s self- luminosity. Earlier on, it was said that the jiva is not independent but an integrated part of Paramātmā and thus dependent on its own Supreme Source. So, how can the jiva be called self-luminous, since it must depend upon Paramātmā? Just as a table is illumined by a bulb, the jiva is illumined by Paramātmā.
To this, Śrī Jiva Gosvāmī responds that Paramātmā is the sup- reme intrinsic essence (parama-svarupa) of the jiva. In other words,
206Ipl 27 The Jiva Is Conscious of Itself
the jiva is not an altogether separate entity (para) from Param- ātmā in the way that a table is a separate and independent object from a light bulb. Therefore, it is wrong to say that the jiva is &ldquo;other-illuminated&rdquo; (para-prakāśya) because Paramātmā is not, in fact, other to the jiva. To support this, Śrī Jiva refers to two verses spoken by Bhagavan Śrī Kṛṣṇa to Uddhava.
In this context, Śrī Viśvanatha Cakravarti, while commenting upon SB 11.10.8, writes, &ldquo;Though it is only Paramātmā who is self- luminous, whereas the jiva is revealed (prakasya) by Paramātmā, yet, even in the matter of its revelation by Paramātmā, the jīva also exhibits some degree of self-luminosity. This condition is compara- ble to metals, such as gold and silver, which have some capacity to reveal themselves and other objects even while being illuminated by the sun.&rdquo; (to)luarent
Here it is worth mentioning that according to the Nyaya School of philosophy, gold and silver are counted as fiery (taijasa) sub- stances (padartha), and not earthly, such as wood or clay, although they appear to be earthly. They are exceptions, just as in modern chemistry, mercury is an exception among metals, which are usu- ally solid at room temperature. Because gold and silver are treated as fiery substances, they are recognized as having some illuminat- ing power in them, albeit very minute in comparison to the sun. Similarly, the ātmā has minute self-luminosity in comparison to Paramātmā. This discussion begins when Uddhava asks Kṛṣṇa:

II The Ontology of the Jiva - Taṭastha-śakti
In response, Bhagavan (using Sankhya-yoga terminology) explains that nature, and/or the psycho-somatic organism, under- goes many types of modifications that can be broadly divided into three categories, namely, adhyatma (psychological), adhibhūta (physical), and adhidaiva&rsquo; (deistic). The sense faculties, being instruments of the psyche, are adhyatma; the sense objects or visible forms, being physical in nature, are adhibhūta; and deis- tic encoding, being the sense-correlation presided over by a deva, is adhidaiva. But the purușa, or the jiva, illuminates all these and is different from them. This means that the puruşa is con- scious and self-luminous by its own nature, whereas prakṛti is &ldquo;other-illuminated.&rdquo;
Adhibhūta, adhidaiva, and adhyatma are interdependent. The existence of psychical instrumentality (adhyatma), such as the fac- ulty of sight, is inferred because of the perception of visible objects. The existence of deistic, or environmental, encoding (adhidaiva), such as the formatting of sunlight to fit the visible range of electro- magnetic radiation, is inferred because of the eye&rsquo;s ability to per- ceive objects. It is because of the involution of a portion of the presiding deity, such as the light of the sun penetrating the eye, that an instrument of sense, or adhyatma, is enabled to see. Other- wise, some other instrument, such as a hand, might also be able to see. According to the Sankhya metaphysics described in Bhagavata Purāņa (3.26.53-61), each sense faculty has a deva related to it who coordinates the functioning of that particular sense. The existence of physical forms (adhibhuta), such as a table, is known through sense perceptions (adhyatma). The sun, however, is exemplified as

The words adhyatma, adhibhūta, and adhidaiva are used with varying imports. Etymologically, they are compounds of the avyayi-bhava type, in the sense of the locative (PANINI 2.1.6). Thus, the word adhyatma commonly means &ldquo;in or related to the atma.&rdquo; Since the word ātmā can mean the body, mind, intellect, ego, the self, or God, the meaning of adhyatma would differ accordingly. Similarly, ce it adhibhūta means &ldquo;in or related to the bhūtas.&rdquo; The word bhuta can mean the five bgreat elements - namely, earth, water, fire, air, and sky- or it could mean
living beings in general. The word adhidaiva means &ldquo;in, of, or related to daiva.&rdquo; The word daiva can mean related to the gods, divine, celestial, fate, immanent We being, or deistic, as it has been defined in this anuccheda.

To see the sun, the eye is needed. Why then is the sun said to be independent or self- luminous? Śrī Jiva answers that although the sun is an object of the eye&rsquo;s perception, it does not need the light of another sun to be seen. It is seen by its own light, which exists both in the eye as well as outside it. Brahman is also called self-luminous, because to realize Brahman, there is need only of vṛtti-vyäpyatva (removal of the covering of the ātmā), but not of phala-vyäpyatva (illumination of the ātmā or Brahman). That the latter is not required is uncon- testable, because Brahman is always already self-illuminated. The same is understood here in regard to the ātmā.

In the next section, Śrī Jīva explains the atma&rsquo;s characteristics of being uniform (eka-rupa), situated in its own essential nature (svarupa-bhāk), rendering the body and senses conscious (cetana), and pervading the body (vyāpti-sila).

self is by its very own constitution exclusively of the nature of consciousness, it also renders conscious other objects, such as the body, just as a lamp [which is of the nature of light] illumi- nates other objects [as well as itself]. This idea was expressed by means of the example in SB 11.10.8 [also in Anuccheda 19], where the word &ldquo;illuminator,&rdquo; prakāśaka, is found, which can be taken to mean &ldquo;that which is the cause of making an object conscious [just as fire makes an iron rod fiery hot].&rdquo;

The jiva&rsquo;s characteristic of pervasiveness [vyāpti-silatva, qual- ity no. 11] will be demonstrated in the statements of Prahlada [SB 7.7.19, quoted in Anuccheda 46 below] where the word vyāpaka is used. The term vyäpti-silatva means that the self&rsquo;s nature is to pervade the interior of all unconscious phenomena in a highly subtle manner.
“ज्ञानमात्रात्मको न च&rdquo; इत्यत्र चिदानन्दात्मक इत्यपि हेत्वन्तरम् । तत्र तस्य जडप्र- तियोगित्वेन ज्ञानत्वं दुःखप्रतियोगित्वेन तु ज्ञानत्वमानन्दत्वं च । ज्ञानत्वं तूदाहृतम् । आनन्दत्वं च निरुपाधिप्रेमास्पदत्वेन साधयति । भा० १० । १४ ।५४ -

Another reason why the self is &ldquo;not merely of the nature of con- sciousness&rdquo; is that it is &ldquo;intrinsically of the nature of conscious- ness and bliss&rdquo; [cid-anandatmaka, quality no. 12]. Because the self is not inert [lit., because of its being the counter-positive of inertness], it is of the nature of consciousness, and because of its being the counter-positive of misery, it is of the nature of consciousness and bliss. That the self is of the nature of con- sciousness has already been illustrated [in Anuccheda 27]. That the self is also of the nature of bliss, anandatva, is established by Śri Suka by pointing out that it is the object of unadulterated love:
2 The ātmā, which is the witness and self-aware, is distinct from the subtle and
gross bodies, in the same way that fire, which burns and illumines, is different from the wood that is burnt.

sbalder lo BECAUSE THE JIVA does not undergo any modification and has inherent potencies, it is therefore eka-rupa, or fixed in form and uniform, and svarupa-bhāk, or situated in its own essential nature. Being conscious, it also imbues the body with consciousness sim- ply by its presence, just as a light bulb illuminates a room by its light. Being highly subtle, it has the ability to pervade everything. Just as subtle x-rays or magnetic rays can penetrate matter around them, similarly, the jiva pervades all phenomena in various forms. It is the conscious substrate, and it also possesses consciousness as its quality.
The jiva is naturally endowed with consciousness and bliss, cid- änandätmaka. If it were mere consciousness, it would not be aware of anything, including ananda. Being cid-anandatmaka, the jiva is neither inert nor miserable. By its very nature, the jiva is free of all pain, unhappiness, sadness, or misery. Therefore, even the sad- dest or most miserable people obtain relief in deep sleep. Nobody experiences pain in deep sleep.
Because the jiva is anandatmaka by nature, it is also the object of pure, unadulterated love. Nobody truly loves misery; rather, everyone seeks änanda. This is why people are enamored by sex. There is no intrinsic joy in sex, but while in union with another

person, one&rsquo;s bodily identification drops for a brief moment, and one experiences, in a sense, the exclusivity of the self. Ignorant people bewildered by maya think that sexual pleasure comes from the orgasm. Nature rewards people with a glimpse of the ananda of the self during the act of copulation to compensate for the ardu- ous task involved in procreation, because prakṛti is specifically pro- grammed to instill this sense of ananda. Moreover, a woman is rewarded with greater pleasure than a man because she has to endure the harder assignment of going through pregnancy, child- birth, and child rearing. So, Canakya and the Kama-śästra say that women experience eight times the pleasure of a man in orgasm, and they can have multiple orgasms, unlike men who are prone to sleep immediately after orgasm.
20 Actually, prakṛti means procreation. So, this is the trick of prakṛti by which people are duped. Otherwise the sexual act makes no sense to a wise person, and thus, there are always injunctions in the scriptures to restrain it. Consequently, everybody loves ananda and so, too, the jiva, who is ananda by nature. Love is not for sex or for another person, but for the self.dsto doses al
Brit Nobody loves misery. The desire to live arises because the jiva is of the nature of bliss (anandātmaka). Since, at the time of death, there is an acute sense of loss and pain associated with the inevitable termination of life, no one wants to die. The fear of death is embedded in the unconscious from past experience. Enlightened beings, however, do not fear death because they have realized that there is no death for the ātmā. The attachments that a person develops for parents, spouse, children, society, wealth, and so on, follow as a consequence of the root attachment to one&rsquo;s own self. Just as the attachment to children is based on the physical body, the attachment to the body is a result of the atma&rsquo;s presence within it. As soon as the ātmā leaves the body, it ceases to hold any attraction; we simply burn or bury it. 919W

In the same way, our attachment to the self is because of the presence of Paramātmā immanent within it, not independently. Thus, Paramātmā is the real object of priti, or love. Paramātmā is the ātmā of our ātmā, the very source of the self. Consequently, the

word para in Paramātmā signifies that He is the Supreme Self or beyond the individual ātmā. In GĪTĀ 3.42, Bhagavan Śrī Kṛṣṇa states that the senses are superior to the gross body, the mind is superior to the senses, the intellect is superior to the mind, but greater even than the intellect is the ātmā. Carrying this sequence a step further, Paramātmā is superior to the ātmā. voorg beyloynt land zuo
at To illustrate this, Śrī Jiva refers to an episode from the divine play (līlā) of Bhagavan Śrī Kṛṣṇa while He was personally present in Vṛndavan. As a young boy, He used to go to the forest along with His friends to tend the calves. Once, while He was eating lunch with them, Brahmä descended from his abode to test Krsna to see if He was actually Bhagavan. From the sky, he saw that Krsna was dressed as a cowherd boy, sitting on the ground surrounded by His friends and enjoying lunch with them. Brahmã could not believe that Bhagavan could be so simple. He decided to test Him by stealing all the calves that were grazing a little distance away.
Not hearing any sound from the bells that encircled the calves&rsquo; necks and then not seeing them, the boys became alarmed and wanted to go in search of them. Kṛṣṇa told them not to spoil their lunch and volunteered to go Himself. He started looking for the calves but could not find any trace of them. Becoming worried, He returned to the place where they had been having their lunch, thinking to inform the others. But to His surprise, He saw that the boys were also missing. In the meantime, Brahma had kid- napped them as well. Krsna thought for a moment and understood Brahma&rsquo;s game. To teach him a lesson, Kṛṣṇa expanded Himself into the same number of calves and boys that Brahma had stolen, with the same appearance, dress, and character. He then contin- ued His lilā as before. Except for Him, nobody knew anything about the episode.

One day, after a year had passed, Krsna&rsquo;s elder brother Balarama and some other boys were grazing the calves near Govardhan Hill. It so happened that the senior cowherd men were also tending cows at the top of the hill. When the cows saw the calves, they were so overwhelmed with love that they rushed headlong toward their respective calves, making bellowing sounds and ignoring the

cowherd men who were vainly trying to stop them. Out of love, the milk overflowed from their udders. The cows suckled their calves while licking their bodies with such intensity it seemed as though they would swallow them.adve
Following the cows in great anger and shame over their inabil- ity to control them, the cowherd men suddenly saw their own chil- dren near the calves. As soon as they saw them, their minds were steeped in love and their anger disappeared. They lifted the boys in their arms, embraced them and experienced great joy by smelling their heads. They had tears in their eyes and their hair stood on end.
Balarama witnessed this whole scene and was surprised that even the cows whose calves had been weaned long ago and had already given birth to their own younger calves were so affection- ate to the weaned calves. He pondered over this and finally under- stood that they were all Kṛṣṇa&rsquo;s expansions; no wonder the cows and cowherd men had even greater affection for these calves and boys than they did for their actual progeny! This incident demon- strates that Paramātmā, or Kṛṣṇa, is the real object of love and that the ātmā, being an integrated part of Paramātmā, is also the object of love.

This is a reference to the maha-vakya, tat tvam asi. See the commentary.
There is an alternate reading here for the word pratibimba (reflection) as pratisva (reverberation), either of which qualifies the pronoun yuşmad (you). In either case, the implication is that the pronoun &ldquo;you,&rdquo; being merely a &ldquo;reflection&rdquo; or a &ldquo;reverberation&rdquo; of the pronoun &ldquo;I,&rdquo; is derivative in nature. Consequently, the jiva is not the referent of the pronoun &ldquo;you.&rdquo; We have followed the first reading because the word &ldquo;reflection&rdquo; (of the self) communicates more effectively the ontological status of the self referred to by the pronoun &ldquo;I.&rdquo; By contrast, the word &ldquo;reverberation&rdquo; (of the pronoun &ldquo;I&rdquo;) might lend greater weight to the signification of grammatical or linguistic insight. Both ontology and linguistic theory are ultimately connected, which is the exact point being addressed here under the discussion of quality no. 13, aham-artha, &ldquo;the jīva as referent of &lsquo;I.&rdquo;&rdquo; So, taken together, the alternate

Thus, consciousness (jñāna), which alone is the primary mean- ing of the pronoun &ldquo;I,&rdquo; is the pure ātmā; otherwise, absorption in matter would not be possible. Because of this absorption, the jiva acquires an alternative sense of &ldquo;I,&rdquo; identified with the aggregate of the material elements [i.e., the body]. It is with this intention that Śrī Kapiladeva speaks about the self&rsquo;s being the referent of &ldquo;I&rdquo;:

By thus identifying with that which is other than itself (parābhi- dhyänena) [namely, the body-mind complex], the self attributes to itself the doership of actions that are in fact carried out by the gunas of primordial nature. (SB 3.26.6)3

Parābhidhyänena means &ldquo;by identifying with material nature (prakṛti),&rdquo; i.e., by believing &ldquo;I am nothing other than prakṛti.&rdquo; By so doing, one considers oneself to be the agent of actions conducted by the gunas of prakṛti. In this regard, because it would be impossible for an entity utterly devoid of the sense of &ldquo;I&rdquo; to become identified with another (para), and because the ahankara, or empirical ego, born of identification with the other [prakṛti] is a covering [of the primordial sense of self], there is certainly another distinct sense of &ldquo;I&rdquo; inherent within the self. Moreover, because that sense of &ldquo;I&rdquo; is grounded exclusively in the jiva&rsquo;s pure identity, it is clearly not the cause of its material bondage. It is precisely these two kinds of ahankära that are indicated in the following verse [from the Eleventh Canto]: &ldquo;The

ātmā is unchanging in the state of deep sleep when the senses and ego are deactivated and there is freedom from the subtle body, which is the cause of transformation. Yet, upon awak- ening, the remembrance comes to us that we slept peacefully without awareness of anything [and this indicates that in deep sleep, the self is present as pure witness devoid of the content of sensual, mental, or egoic awareness]&rdquo; (SB 11.3.39).

IN THIS SECTION, Śri Jiva establishes that the pure self has &ldquo;I&rdquo;- consciousness as its very nature. There is &ldquo;I&rdquo;-consciousness in rela- tion to the physical body because of which we make statements, such as &ldquo;I am weak,&rdquo; &ldquo;I am slim,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I am tall.&rdquo; In these sentences, &ldquo;I&rdquo; refers to the physical body. We also make statements such as, &ldquo;I am happy,&rdquo; and &ldquo;I am angry.&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rdquo; in these sentences refers to the mind, or the psychological self. Beyond these aspects of the phenomenal &ldquo;I,&rdquo; there is a real &ldquo;I&rdquo; inherent within the self.

29 The Jiva Is the Referent of &ldquo;T&rdquo;-I 11
The Advaitavādīs do not accept the existence of I-conscious- ness in the self. According to them, the &ldquo;I&rdquo; is manifest only when Brahman is limited by ajñāna and is called the jiva. When ajñāna is removed by the cultivation of jñāna, then the jiva is Brahman, which has no &ldquo;I&rdquo;-consciousness. They propose that Brahman is pure, uniform consciousness and bliss, and when it reflects in ajñāna, it is called the jiva. This jiva is signified by the pronoun &ldquo;You&rdquo; in the famous aphorism, &ldquo;You are That&rdquo; (tat tvam asi). In this statement, &ldquo;That&rdquo; (tat) refers to Brahman and &ldquo;You&rdquo; (tvam) to the jiva. On the basis of this assertion, they attempt to deny that there is an authentic sense of &ldquo;I&rdquo; that is intrinsic to the jiva, because, according to them, the pure jiva is identical to Brahman, which is devoid of &ldquo;I&rdquo;-consciousness. They consider the individ- uated conscious self as the suggested meaning of the pronoun &ldquo;You,&rdquo; viviktam pratyak-caitanyaṁ tvam-pada-lakṣārtho bhavati (Tattvānusandhāna 1.42). bib has sw jus
o bib brs Ilswjqsla linamstata si n SŚrī Jiva Gosvāmi refutes this by arguing that the jiva is intrinsi- cally endowed with a real sense of &ldquo;I.&rdquo; Moreover, being conditioned by ajñāna, it cannot be identical to Brahman. Thus, it cannot be the referent of the pronoun &ldquo;you,&rdquo; which is interpreted in Advaita- vāda as referring to the individual jiva in the famous mahā-vākya, tat tvam asi. Śrī Jiva refers to the verse of Bhagavata Purana (11.3.39), which states that during deep sleep, the self is unaware of either the subtle or gross bodies. This means that the phenomenal &ldquo;I&rdquo; is non- functional at that time. Deep sleep is not possible without being disconnected from the phenomenal “I.”
In the waking state, one is aware of the gross body, the senses, and the internal faculties (i.e., the components of the psyche), which include the phenomenal &ldquo;I.&rdquo; In the dream state, one is not aware of the gross body and the senses, but consciousness remains connected still to the internal or psychic faculties. In deep sleep, one is not aware of anything. Nevertheless, on awakening a person

remembers the pleasant experience of sleep. This pleasant experi- ence of sleep, in which one is unaware of anything, would not be possible if there were no &ldquo;I&rdquo; present as witness of that state. There can be no experience without a sense of &ldquo;I,&rdquo; the experiencer. Only a person who experiences something can have a recollection of the experience. Since one remembers having enjoyed deep sleep, it logically follows that there must be an experiencer. Consequently, there must be a real &ldquo;I&rdquo; besides the phenomenal &ldquo;I.&rdquo; On awakening, the phenomenal &ldquo;I&rdquo; is superimposed onto the real one.
The experience of deep sleep entails an absence (abhava) of any material sensation. As such, it is not an experience involving posi- tive existence (bhava). According to the Vaiseṣika School, absence (abhāva) is one of the padarthas, or ontological categories, and thus liable to be experienced. Therefore, Patanjali rightly accepts deep sleep (nidra) as one of the states of the mind (citta-vṛttis).
In the statement, &ldquo;I slept well and did not know anything,&rdquo; there are two parts. One is the knowledge of sleeping well and the other is the absence of knowing anything else. The absence of knowing anything else implies both non-awareness of the material ego, and the presence of the witness of this non-awareness who recollects on waking up. Thus, there is real &ldquo;I&rdquo;-consciousness in the ātmā, which is the referent of the pronoun &ldquo;I,&rdquo; and there is the phenome- nal &ldquo;I,&rdquo; which is part of the subtle material body. These are the two ahankaras, referring to &ldquo;I&rdquo;-consciousness or self-identity. Without a real &ldquo;I,&rdquo; it would not be possible to identify with the phenomenal &ldquo;I.&rdquo;

To identify with something, there must first be someone who identifies. This superimposition of the phenomenal &ldquo;I&rdquo; onto the real &ldquo;I&rdquo; is called the knot in the heart, hṛdaya-granthi, or the knot tying consciousness to matter, cit-jaḍa-granthi. This is the basis of material bondage resulting in the cycle of birth and death, called samṁsāra.ter

But the body and mind are active only because of the presence of the ātmā. Without the presence of the ātmā, they would be inert.

psycho-somatic organism. The self identifies with the modifica- tions of the mind and appropriates them as its own. Although inac- tive by itself, it is the instrumental cause of all actions. This shows that the self has its own intrinsic &ldquo;I&rdquo; and agency, albeit these inher- ent capacities of the self are manifest only through the body and mind. According to Sanskrit grammar, there are three types of kartā, or agents, namely, independent, impelling, and impelled:
The agent is of three types. It is said that the &ldquo;agent simpliciter&rdquo; is independent. The &ldquo;impelling agent&rdquo; is one who causes another to perform an action. The &ldquo;impelled agent&rdquo; is one who is made to perform an action?
If there were no real &ldquo;I&rdquo; in the self and no real agency, then the self would not be able to identify with the functions of the mind. The self is the seer and mind is the seen. By the force of the material gunas, the self mistakes the actions of the body and mind as its own.
In the above verse, it is said that the self is impelled to follow. In reality, the self does not follow because it is actionless. It appears to follow only because of identification, just as a stationary train appears to its own passengers to be moving when in juxtaposition to a departing train.

Commentary
31 The Jiva Is the Referent of &ldquo;I&rdquo; - III
NO ONE CAN WITNESS his own head being chopped off. The eyes by which a person is enabled to see belong to the very same head that is beheaded. How could anyone witness such an event when deprived of the same eyes that would make its vision possible? But one can sometimes observe such contradictions in a dream. The head is not actually cut off, but such an illusion can be created in a dream. Bhagavan&rsquo;s māyā is such that it can accomplish things that seem otherwise impossible. Similarly, by the power of māyā, the self can superimpose upon itself an action occurring external to itself.
This example of a dream also demonstrates that the self has its own innate &ldquo;I&rdquo;-consciousness, distinct from its phenomenal sense of &ldquo;I.&rdquo; If the self did not have a real &ldquo;I,&rdquo; it would not be possible for illusion to be superimposed upon it. There is a saying in Sanskrit that one can paint only if there is a canvass on which to do so, sati kudye citram. Every illusion requires a basis (adhiṣṭhāna) on which it can be founded, just as a rope is the basis of its misidentification as a snake. Thus, if there were no real &ldquo;I,&rdquo; there would be no support for the illusion of misidentification with the phenomenal &ldquo;I.&rdquo; In the next anuccheda, Śrī Jiva explains the next characteristic of the jiva, that a distinct ātmā is present in each body.

BY ESTABLISHING that &ldquo;I&rdquo;-consciousness is intrinsic to the self&rsquo;s inherent identity, it is automatically established that the self is also distinct in each body [prati-kṣetram bhinnaḥ, quality no. 14]. Yet, the following reference [seems to support the oneness of the jīvas, which is contrary to the above conclusion.

In this regard, the oneness of the jivātmās indicated in the words of Śrī Hamsadeva, who assumes the perspective of an ordinary jiva, is posited in accordance with the common fashion of a teacher of the jñāna-märga, or as a consequence of the mate- rial vision of the Kumāras [implied by their dualistic question]. So, although there is a difference among parts, or between the whole and its parts, this statement of the oneness of the jivas is indeed spoken as a means to jñāna for those desiring jñāna and is submitted with reference to the jivas&rsquo; common identity [of con- sciousness], without distinguishing their individuality. This type of undiscriminated reference to a single common attribute is expressed again in the very next verse:

Your question, &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; [if it relates to the physical body], REVis indeed just a meaningless sequence of words, since the bodies of the living beings are identical, constituted in reality of the five elements. (SB 11.13.23)2
तत्राप्यंशभेदोऽस्त्येव । अत उक्तं स्वयं भगवता “शुनि चैव श्वपाके च पण्डिताः समदर्शिनः” (गीता ५।१८) इति । “निर्दोषं हि समं ब्रह्म&rdquo; (गीता ५ । १९) इत्यादि च । अत्र ब्रह्मेति जीवब्रह्मैवोच्यते । यथा “ययाहमेतत् सदसत् स्वमायया पश्ये मयि ब्रह्मणि कल्पितं परे” ( भा० १।५।२७) इति ।
Even in this regard, a difference exists among individuated parts. Therefore, Bhagavan Kṛṣṇa Himself says: &ldquo;The wise see with equal vision a brahmana endowed with education and humility, a cow, an elephant, a dog, and a dog-eater&rdquo; (GĪTĀ 5.18) And, &ldquo;Brahman is equipoised and faultless&rdquo; (GĪTĀ 5.19). Here the word brahman refers to the jiva. As Śrī Narada said: &ldquo;By the influence of enlightened intuition, I could perceive that

The meaning of this statement is as follows: This cause-effect aggregate (sad-asat-sanghata) in the form of my body is merely assumed out of self-ignorance as existing in me, the [individu- ated] Brahman (mayi brahmani). Additionally, in the form of the universe, it is assumed as existing in the Supreme Brahman (pare brahmani). Because of the ignorance related to the self, called jiva-māyā, I conceived that &ldquo;I am the body alone,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;the universe alone, consisting of gods, such as Indra and Candra, is the supreme regulating agency (iśvara).&rdquo; By the influ- ence of enlightened intuition (mati), I realized that all this was merely conceptually constructed (kalpita).
समानकारणत्वादेव पूर्ववदन्यत्र च सोऽहं स च त्वमिति ।
It is only because of the jivas&rsquo; common identity [of conscious- ness], indicated above as well as elsewhere, that we find identity statements, such as, &ldquo;I am That&rdquo; and &ldquo;You are That.&rdquo;

On the other hand, statements, such as the one below, are specif- ically in reference to Paramātmā:
Just as air, which is one without distinction and pervasive, is designated by names, such as sadja (&ldquo;born of six&rdquo;) to indicate the difference it assumes when passing through the six differ- ent holes of the venu flute, so too it is with the Supreme Self [the Supreme Immanent, Paramātmā, who is one but manifests in many ways].

II The Ontology of the Jiva - Taṭastha-sakti
Here, because innumerability (aparimitatva) and eternality (dhruvatva) are read as prior to the hypothetical conjunction yadi (if), there is no doubt about their [being attributes of the jiva]. This is the view of the Śrutis. But all-pervasiveness (sarva- gatatva) is read after yadi [in the verse], indicating that there is doubt in this regard. This clearly shows that the latter sup- position is the view of others [and not that of the Śrutis]. For this reason, the statement describing Paramātmā, &ldquo;One Divin- ity remains hidden in all beings,&rdquo;&rdquo; informs us of the plurality of the jivas.
Commentary
Because of the igno

the self.
IF THE JĪVA HAS real &ldquo;I&rdquo;-consciousness, then this must lead us to the conclusion that there is a separate jiva in each body. Otherwise, there would be no meaning to the jiva having a real &ldquo;I.&rdquo; As a possible objection to this conclusion, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi refers to an episode from the Eleventh Canto, Chapter 13.) [ yem
While Bhagavan Śrī Kṛṣṇa was instructing Uddhava, the latter inquired about the instructions of the Hamsa avatara to the Four Kumāras. Kṛṣṇa replied that the Four Kumāras once questioned their father, Brahma, about the unfailing and highest consumma- tion of yoga. They asked, &ldquo;The mind becomes absorbed in sense objects and the sense objects enter the mind as impressions, so how can a person desiring liberation separate them from each other&rdquo; (SB 11.13.17)?10
Brahma was unable to respond to the Kumāras and meditated on Bhagavan Kṛṣṇa, who appeared as a hamsa, a swan. In Indian poetics, a swan is depicted as possessing the ability to separate milk from water. Bhagavan appeared in the form of Hamsa to sig- nify this ability of discernment between the ātmā and matter. The Kumāras along with their father, Brahma, approached Bhagavan in

this form and paid respects to Him. The Kumāras then asked, &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;
face
Jai Bhagavan began His response with verse 11.13.22, quoted at the beginning of this section. From His reply, it may appear that there is no difference among the various jivas. This is contrary to the conclusion of the plurality of the jivas brought out in the previous section. Alimielinen badhabab
Śrī Jiva explains that such a response by Hamsa was put forth in view of the convictions of the Kumāras, who were teachers of the jñāna-märga, in which the jiva is accepted as entirely one with and nondifferent from Brahman. It is as if Hamsa were asking, &ldquo;How can you, the topmost brahma-jñānis, possibly pose such a question to Me?&rdquo; If, however, their question was posed addressing Hamsa as just another jīva, it would still make no sense, because according to them, all jivas are of one identity (samän-äkära) and devoid of dis- tinguishing features. If the question was raised considering Him to be Brahman, that too would make no sense, because there is noth- ing other than Brahman. If one holds such convictions, it would be futile to ask, &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;, since there would be no difference between the questioner and the questioned.
bi Moreover, if the question was related to the body, then again it would make no sense, because everyone&rsquo;s body is made of the same five tattvas, namely, earth, water, fire, air, and ether. There would be nothing unique about Hamsa&rsquo;s body. This was known to the Kumāras and thus their question was simply a formality, just as people ask, &ldquo;How are you?&rdquo;, and the reply commonly given is, &ldquo;I am fine, thank you.&rdquo; So, the intention of Hamsa&rsquo;s reply to the Kumāras was to address their own presuppositions, rooted in the monistic view.
The fact is, however, that all jivas are individuals. This is clear from GĪTĀ 5.18 where Krsna says that whoever sees the equality of the jivas in all bodies, whether that of a brahmana, a cow, an ele- phant, a dog, or dog-eater, is genuinely wise. The differences per- tain to the body, not to the ātmā. If there were only one ātmā in all of these bodies, then Kṛṣṇa would have said that a person who recog- nizes the one Brahman in all of them, is truly wise. He would have
231
II The Ontology of the Jiva - Taṭastha-sakti
used the words brahma-darsinah or eka-darśinah instead of sama- darsinah. Therefore, in the next verse (GĪTĀ 5.19), Kṛṣṇa says that a jiva (brahman) becomes faultless (nirdosa) when established in this vision of equality (sama).ra
In this verse, the word brahman is used for the jiva, which is unusual. As such, Śrī Jiva refers to the samadhi of Śrī Nārada described in SB 1.5.17, where the word brahman is similarly used for the jiva. Because both Brahman and the jiva are conscious by nature, the word brahman can also be used for the jiva, even though it is primarily used to denote the Supreme Consciousness. It is used in this way because the jiva is an integrated part of Brahman. It is not unusual for a word that generally designates the whole to be used instead to denote its part. For example, when we say, &ldquo;There is not enough sun in this room,&rdquo; the word &ldquo;sun&rdquo; is used to mean &ldquo;sunlight.&rdquo;
It is because the ātmā and Brahman share an identity in terms of consciousness that some statements are found in scripture equat- ing the individual self with the Supreme Self, such as, &ldquo;I am Brah- man,&rdquo;&rdquo; and, &ldquo;You are that Brahman.&ldquo;12 The intention of such state- ments is to emphasize the jiva&rsquo;s identity as pure consciousness, dis- tinct from matter, not to convey absolute oneness of the jiva and Brahman. By way of contrast, the word jiva is also sometimes used for the Supreme Consciousness, as in the following verse:
Time merges into the cosmic being (jiva), the regulator of māyā, and the cosmic being (jiva) merges into Me, the unborn Self. (SB 11.24.27)13
From the point of view of bodily distinction, there is a differ- ence from one person to another. Because of differences in appear- ance, there is favoritism, hatred, and exploitation. For this reason, śästra teaches us to give up envy, hatred, and jealousy by informing us that all jīvas are the same by nature. Unless we realize this unity, we will remain bound by the gunas of nature, which are the cause ads ads or son ybod sift of nisi He and blow say modestod sead

of the varieties apparent to the eye. The first step on the spiritual path is to become aware of the existence of spirit beyond matter. It is on this account that the variety resulting from bodily differences is censured. This is the intention behind verse SB 11.10.32. Where there is no plurality, there is no dependency or control by anyone, and thus there is no cause of fear. alunod to reboose T

In the Visnu Purāṇa verse cited next, however, even though the language is similar, it is indicated that everything is a manifesta- tion of Paramātmā. The self being referred to here by the com- pound mahātmanaḥ, &ldquo;the Supreme Self,&rdquo; is Paramātmā and not the jiva. The verse is spoken by Jada Bharata to King Rahugaṇa, while instructing the latter on the supreme object of human attainment. He stated this earlier, &ldquo;O King, hear from me in brief about the sup- reme goal.&ldquo;14 From this it is evident that Jada Bharata&rsquo;s statement is about Paramātmā and not the individual ātmā. The verse declares that just as the air, which is one without distinction, is auditorily experienced as different when passing through the various holes of a flute, so also the one Supreme Being manifests in diverse ways. Consequently, this verse from the Visnu Purana should not be inter- preted to support the idea that there is only one ātmā in various bodies. her mensa atomic (partmine), which means that
To further emphasize the plurality of the jivas, Śrī Jīva Gosvāmī cites a verse from the prayers of the personified Vedas, which is the principal quotation in this anuccheda. The verse says that if the embodied beings [jivas], who are innumerable and eternal, were to be admitted as all-pervading, they could not be under the regulation of any Supreme Being. po
Śrī Jiva Gosvāmi analyzes this statement as having two parts - that which is given and that which expresses the supposition. The given is the fact that the jivas are innumerable and eternal. In the Sanskrit verse, this part appears before the hypothetical conjunc- tion &ldquo;if,&rdquo; thus there can be no doubt as to the jivas&rsquo; attributes men- tioned here of innumerability and eternality. This being the sub- ject, or that which is given in sentential construction, its certainty

is not in question. A simple sentence is composed of a subject and a predicate. The subject expresses what is given or known, and the predicate proceeds to tell us something unknown about the subject. It is for this reason that Śri Jiva takes this part of the statement as the opinion of the Vedas personified.
ozud
The second part of the Śrutis&rsquo; statement expresses the supposi- tion, &ldquo;If the jivas were to be admitted as all-pervading.&rdquo; This part is doubtful because it is introduced with the hypothetical &ldquo;if.&rdquo; Śri Jiva concludes on the basis of this doubt that the supposition is not the opinion of the Śrutis. Moreover, if the jivas were truly all- pervading, they could not be subservient to any Supreme Being, a view which is unacceptable to the Śrutis, as is clear from their prayers.d
DdeaH
The statement from Svetāśvatara Upanisad (6.11) also implies that there are many jivas. If there were only one jiva, it would be meaningless to say that one Divinity resides in all beings. Śrī Jīva Gosvām next continues to examine the attributes of the jiva listed in Jāmātṛ Muni&rsquo;s verses.

JĀMĀTṚ MUNI OFFERS another reason why there is a different jiva in each body - namely, because it is anu [quality no. 15]. The word anu here means atomic (paramāņu), which means that it cannot be further subdivided even with respect to spatial dimen- sions [like a point]. This indeed is the irreducible limit of a
par- ticle according to authorities in this particular field [i.e., the Vaiseṣika philosophers]. Although atomic, it infuses conscious- ness into the whole body because this is its innate quality man- ifesting as a unique potency. This potency is like that of a dose of mahauṣadhi (a type of medicinal herb), which nourishes the entire body even if it is embedded in lac and kept on a single part of the body, such as the head. Or it is like that of a magnet, which induces a piece of iron to move.qgos besilered of al se avit ni bensins and (b) soto) Latv तदेतदणुत्वमाह “सूक्ष्माणामप्यहं जीवः” (भा० ११ । १६।११) इति ।

The word &ldquo;atom&rdquo; here is used to signify an entity that is limited, partless, and hence indivisible.

II The Ontology of the Jiva - Tatastha-sakti
Its atomicity is spoken of by Śrī Kṛṣṇa: &ldquo;Among immense objects I am the mahat-tattva, and of subtle [i.e., infinitesimal] things I am the jiva&rdquo; (SB 11.16.11).2
तस्मात् सूक्ष्मतापराकाष्ठाप्राप्तो जीव इत्यर्थः । दुर्ज्ञेयत्वाद् यत् सूक्ष्मत्वं तदत्र न विवक्षि- तम् “महतां च महानहं सूक्ष्माणामप्यहं जीवः” (भा० ११ । १६ । ११) इति परस्परप्रतियोगि- त्वेन वाक्यद्वयस्यानन्तर्योक्तौ स्वारस्यभङ्गात् । प्रपञ्चमध्ये हि सर्वकारणत्वान् महत्तत्त्व- स्य महत्त्वं नाम व्यापकत्वं न तु पृथिव्याद्यपेक्षया सुज्ञेयत्वं यथा तद्वत् प्रपञ्चे जीवानामपि सूक्ष्मत्वं परमाणुत्वमेवेति स्वारस्यम् ।

Therefore, the jiva is the irreducible limit of infinitesimality (sūkṣmatā). Here the word sükṣmatva is meant not in the sense of subtleness due to incomprehensibility [but rather, in the sense of infinitesimality or minuteness]. Otherwise, the nat- ural flow of these two statements, &ldquo;Among immense objects I am the mahat-tattva, and of subtle [i.e., infinitesimal] things I am the jiva,&rdquo; spoken of consecutively in mutual contrast, would be lost. In regard to the manifested cosmos, the mahat-tattva&rsquo;s quality of immensity (mahattva) actually refers to its perva- siveness because it is the cause of all subsequent phenomenal appearances. [So just as the suksmatva of the jiva here does not refer to subtleness due to incomprehensibility,] the mahattva of the mahat-tattva does not imply that it is easily comprehensible in comparison to other elements, such as earth. Similarly, the subtleness of the jivas in the world refers specifically to their atomicity. This is the natural meaning. dqosolid ali -nen viilsup

The following Śruti statements also support this: &ldquo;This atomic self is to be realized through pure intelligence into which the vital force (prāna) has entered in five forms [implying that the vital force is supported by the ātmā]&rdquo; (MUU 3.1.9); &ldquo;The size of the jiva should be known as one ten-thousandth part of the tip

of a hair&rdquo; (su 5.9);* and &ldquo;The jiva is perceived as of the size of the tip of an awl [or knife]&rdquo; (su 5.8)5
estudi tiros der Commentary
ONE OF THE CHARACTERISTICS of the jiva is its atomic size, anutva. An anu is defined as an infinitesimal particle that is without further parts. The Bhāgavata Purana (3.11.1) also defines a paramāņu as the smallest division of matter, which cannot be further subdivided. It is not even possible to make spatial or directional references to the aņu, such as speaking of its eastern or western side. Indeed, it is more like a geometrical point that has location but no dimension. Being atomic in size, one jiva cannot exist in all bodies, and so there must be a different jiva in each body. This is further evidence as to the multiplicity of the jīvas.
An objection may be raised to this statement. If the jiva is the sole source of consciousness in the body and yet is atomic, then how does it render the entire body conscious? Should it not affect only that part of the body in which it is present? To this, Śrī Jiva replies that the jiva has a special innate characteristic by which it extends its consciousness throughout the whole body although situated in just one part of it. In this respect, it is like a light bulb that illumi- nates the whole room while occupying just one part of it. In Bhaga- vad Gita, Śrī Kṛṣṇa gives the example of the sun, which although one, illuminates this entire universe (GĪTĀ 13.33)?

past, people would apply this herb to their hair with the help of lac or resin. A similar herb, often mentioned in Sanskrit literature, is hari-candana, a type of sandalwood that, if applied anywhere on the skin, would cool the whole body. Brahma-sutra (2.3.25) contributes the example of a flower&rsquo;s fragrance to convey the same idea.
Śrī Jiva then directs us to the principal verse of this anuccheda. While describing His vibhutis to Uddhava, Śrī Kṛṣṇa said that among subtle (sükṣmaṇām), or in other words infinitesimal, things, He is the jiva. The word sūkṣma can mean subtle, small, or diffi- cult to comprehend. Here the latter meaning is not applicable, because in the verse it has been contrasted with the word mahat, or immense. Among immense objects, Kṛṣṇa is the mahat-tattva. The mahat-tattva is all-pervading, whereas the jiva is aņu, or atomic in size. Since the two are being juxtaposed here, if sūkṣma were to mean incomprehensible, then mahat-tattva would have to mean &ldquo;easy to comprehend.&rdquo; But such is not the case. On the other hand, to take the meaning of sukṣma as difficult to understand and that of mahat as all-pervading, would be a mismatch and would disrupt the flow of meaning. Moreover, there are numerous corroborat- ing statements in the Śruti that describe the jiva as aņu. Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmi has cited three such references. The first of these is from the Mundaka Upanisad, which also states that the self is atomic.
It might be objected that the subject under discussion here is Paramātmā and that, therefore, the word anu does not mean atomic but difficult to comprehend. The verse would then be read as, &ldquo;This Paramātmā is difficult to understand and is to be realized through pure intelligence.&rdquo; This view, however, cannot be accepted, because according to Jaimini-sūtra (3.3.14), in deter- mining the hermeneutical strength of scriptural statements, the contextual meaning (prakarana) is weaker in force than linga, or the inferred meaning: &ldquo;When direct statement (śruti), inferential mark or word-meaning (linga), sentence or syntactical connection (vākya), context or interdependence (prakarana), position or order

of words (sthāna), and name (samakhyā) are present simultane- ously, each member is progressively weaker in interpretive force, because of increasing remoteness from the meaning.&rdquo;
In the same statement of Mundaka Upanisad, the inferential mark (linga) is prāna (the vital force), which overrides the context. The inferential mark is that reason, or cause, by virtue of which the conclusion can be validly inferred. In the reference cited, it is only in the individual ātmā, or in other words, in the jiva, that there is pervasion of the vital force in its five forms. Thus, there is invariable concomitance between prāņa and the jīva (just as there is invariable concomitance between smoke and fire). So, where prāṇa is mentioned, it is clear that the reference must be to the jiva and not to Paramātmā.
In other
The second quotation is from Śvetāśvatara Upanisad (5.9). The last part of this verse reads, &ldquo;[The self] is destined for infinity&rdquo; (sa canantyāya kalpate). This could be interpreted to mean that the self is unlimited (ananta), whereby its being anu, or atomic, would only be an illusion, the reality being its all-pervasiveness. But this can- not be the case because the word anantya here refers to liberation, and thus the intended meaning of the verse is &ldquo;the self is eligible for liberation.&rdquo; Anta means &ldquo;end&rdquo; or &ldquo;death.&rdquo; Ananta means &ldquo;with- out death,&rdquo; i.e., immortal, and thus anantyāya means &ldquo;immortality&rdquo; or &ldquo;liberation.&rdquo; Or, an alternative interpretation is that by coming into contact with Brahman in the liberated state, the jiva becomes as if all-pervading by the power of Brahman.
These statements referring to the ātmā as being one ten- thousandth the size of the tip of a hair or an awl are not meant to be taken literally, since its atomic nature has been defined as having no dimension. Next, Śri Jiva Gosvāmī refers to the prayers of the Vedas personified to further demonstrate the atomicity of the jiva.

O eternal one [Bhagavan], if the embodied beings [jīvas], Tuwho are innumerable and eternal, were to be admitted as all- pervading, then their subordination to another could not be maintained, [for that] is possible only in the opposite case [of their being atomic in size and not all-pervading]. You, from whom all these jivas have come, being their cause, pervade them unrestrictedly [i.e., completely]; thus You are their regulator. Those who consider You as equal to others have not understood You due to adopting a faulty view. (SB 10.87.30)1

34 The śrutis Argue for the Atomicity of the Jiva
स्युस्तर्हि तेषां व्याप्यत्वाभावेन समत्वात् शास्यतेति नियमो न स्यात् । ईश्वरो नियन्ता जीवो नियम्य इति वेदकृतनियमो न घटत इत्यर्थः ।
This verse is to be understood as follows: It is described [in the Śrutis] that the jiva is an integrated part of Paramātmā and is thus an emanation from Him. Since texts like GĪTĀ 15.7 (mamai- vārśo jiva-loke) establish the jiva as a part [of Paramātmā], it is improper to consider it as all-pervading. To correct this miscon- ception, the śrutis speak this verse. In reality, the jivas (tanu- bhṛta, lit., &ldquo;embodied beings&rdquo;) are countless in number (apari- mitā) and eternal ( dhruvā ). If they were all-pervading (sarva- gatāḥ), then they would not be subject to anyone else&rsquo;s control (na śāsyatā), because in that case, they would all be equal, not being pervaded by anyone. In other words, the Vedic principle that Iśvara is the regulator and the jiva the regulated would not apply.
(13
हे ध्रुव ! इतरथा जीवस्याणुत्वेन व्याप्यत्वभावे तु सति न तन्नियम इति न । अपि तु स घटत एवेत्यर्थः । अथ “यतो वा इमानि भूतानि जायन्ते &quot; ( तै०३।१) इति जायमानत्वाव- स्थायामपि व्याप्यव्यापकत्वेनैव नियम्यनियन्तृत्वं भवति ।
On the other hand, O eternal Bhagavān (Dhruva), because the jiva is atomic and is thus undoubtedly pervaded, the non- application of the above Vedic principle is itself negated, mean- ing that it is most certainly applicable. Moreover, it is said, &ldquo;He from whom all these beings are born&rdquo; (TU 3.1.1), indicating that even in the jiva&rsquo;s state of being an emanation, the principle of the regulated and the regulator is valid, because one is the pervaded while the other is the pervader.
सर्वत्रैव कार्यकारणयोस्तथाभावदर्शनादित्याहुः - अजनीति । यन्मयं यदुपादानकं यदजनि जातं जायत इत्यर्थः । तदुपादानं कर्तृ तस्य जायमानस्य यन् नियन्तृ भवेत् तदविमुच्य किञ्चिदप्यमुक्त्वा व्याप्यैवेत्यर्थः । किं च यदुपादानरूपं परमात्माख्यं तत्त्वं केनाप्यपरेण समं समानमित्यनुजानतां यः कश्चित् तथा वदति । तत्रानुज्ञामपि ददताममतं ज्ञातं न भवतीत्यर्थः । तत्र हेतुः - मतदुष्टतया तस्य मतस्याशुद्धत्वेन ।

11 The Ontology of the Jiva - Tatastha-sakti
Because such a relation between effect and cause is seen in all cases, therefore, the Śrutis speak the second half of the verse: Whatever is the material cause (yan-maya) of that which is generated (ajani), that cause, being the agent, is the regula- tor (niyanty) of the generated entity. It pervades the gener- ated entity completely, not leaving any part of it aside (avimu- cya). Moreover, should someone claim that the entity called Paramātmā, assuming the form of the material cause, is equal to some other being (sama), then even the person who endorses such a statement (anujānatām) does not know (amata) Param- ātmā [in truth]. The reason is that their opinion is faulty (mata-duṣṭataya), meaning that it is impure.

The impurity in this regard is that it contradicts the Vedic canons, such as the following Vedic statements: &ldquo;This, the Sup- reme Being, is utterly without equal; no one at all is seen to be like Him. All these beings take birth, die, and are incomplete. Whereas, the Supreme Being [Bhagavan] neither takes birth nor dies. All others are incomplete&rdquo; (Caturveda-sikha Upani- sad); &ldquo;There is none equal or superior to Him&rdquo; (su 6.8); &ldquo;Why is He called Brahman? Because He expands (bṛmhati) and causes others to evolve (brmhayati)&rdquo; (Atharva-sira Upanisad 3.4). In the Vişņu Purāna also [it is stated]: &ldquo;They know Brahman as the Sup- reme because of His immensity (bṛhatva) and because of being the cause of others evolvement (brmhaṇatva)&rdquo; (VP 1.12.57).

Therefore, only Paramātmā is all-pervading, as is said: &ldquo;One Divinity remains hidden in all beings. He is all-pervading and the indwelling Self of all beings&rdquo; (su 6.11)? Therefore, the jiva is certainly atomic. But what, then, is intended by the description of the jiva in Śri Bhagavad Gita, wherein it is said, &ldquo;It is eternal, all-pervading, and stable&rdquo; (GĪTĀ 2.24)? Here &ldquo;all-pervading&rdquo; (sarvagata) indeed refers to Śrī Bhagavän. Situated in Him and being under His shelter, the atomic jiva is [also] referred to as all-pervading and stable.
Commentary

Jamary Muni
TO FURTHER FORTIFY HIS ARGUMENT about the atomic nature of the jiva, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī refers to the prayers of the Vedas per- sonified at the beginning of creation. The logic set forth by the Vedas is that if the jivas were all-pervading like Paramātmā or Brah- man, then there would be no principle of ruler and ruled, or regu- lator and regulated. This would contradict Vedic statements, such as, &ldquo;He is one, the controller, and the indwelling Self of all beings&rdquo; (KU 2.2.12), and, &ldquo;He alone is the one who fulfills the desires of the many&rdquo; (KU 2.2.13) 10 Therefore, it is improper to adduce that the jiva is all-pervading. According to the Bhagavad Gită verse cited at the beginning of this section (15.7), the jiva is an integrated part of Bhagavan. A part cannot be all-pervading; anything that is all-pervading cannot be part of anything else.

The Śrutis offer another reason why the jiva is not to be taken as all-pervading. They declare that Bhagavan is He from whom all

II The Ontology of the Jiva - Tatastha-sakti
jīvas have come and is thus their source. He is both the material cause (upādāna) as well as the efficient cause (nimitta), abhinna- nimitta-upādāna-karana. To generate an object, there is need of some material ingredients (upādāna) and a sentient agent (nimi- tta), who manipulates the ingredients to produce the object. Usu- ally, these two causal factors refer to two distinct entities or sub- stances. For example, gold is the material cause of a golden bracelet, whereas a goldsmith is its efficient cause. Bhagavan, however, is in an entirely unique category of causality in relation to the material world. In the beginning, only He existed, and thus He alone is both the material and efficient cause. Logically, a material cause per- vades the effect. For example, gold is the material cause of a golden bracelet. The bracelet is pervaded by gold; there is no part of it that is not gold.
While referring to prakṛti as the cause of the mahat, which is the first evolute of primordial nature, Iśvarakṛṣṇa writes:
The manifest [i.e., the evolute] is caused, non-eternal, non- to pervasive, mobile, manifold, dependent, mergent [i.e., subject OT to dissolution back into its originating cause], made up of parts,
and subordinate. The unmanifest is just the opposite of this. (Sankhya-kärikā 10)11
This kārikā clearly states that the effect is non-pervasive (avyāpi), meaning that it is pervaded by its cause, and subordinate (paratantra), meaning that it is governed by another. The cause, on the other hand, is just the opposite of these attributes, meaning that it is pervasive (vyapi) and independent (svatantra), or in other words, the regulator. Therefore, the jiva cannot be all-pervading. It is anu, as stated in the various Upanisadic statements cited in the previous section.
Śrī Jiva Gosvāmī next draws attention to a verse of Bhagavad Gitā (2.24), in which Śrī Kṛṣṇa refers to the jiva as sarva-gata, or all- pervading. If this is the case, then how can the jiva be accepted as aņu, or atomic? Jiva Gosvāmī responds that the compound

savayavaṁ paratantraṁ vyaktaṁ viparītam avyaktam bahroated
244
34 The Śrutis Argue for the Atomicity of the Jiva
sarva-gata (&ldquo;gone everywhere&rdquo;) does not mean that the jiva is all-pervading, but since it is situated within Bhagavan who is all- pervading and is dependent upon Him, the jiva is also referred to as all-pervading. Śrīla Viśvanatha Cakravarti comments that sarva-gata means that the jivas enter into all the various forms of life according to their karma.2
Two other possible interpretations for sarva-gata have been provided. Rāmānuja in his commentary to this Gitä verse and to 2.17 says that it means that the individual jīvas are present everywhere since consciousness is more subtle than matter13 Viś- vanatha Cakravarti, on the other hand, interprets it to mean that the jiva is all-pervading in the body by virtue of consciousness.&rdquo;&rdquo; It is, therefore, concluded that the jiva is aņu, whereas Paramātmā is all-pervading, as is explicit from the mantra of Śvetāśvatara Upanisad (6.11) cited in this anuccheda.

THE JIVA is eternal [nitya, quality no. 16] and unblemished [nirmala, quality no. 17] because it is intrinsically pure by nature, as demonstrated already in SB 5.11.12 (Anuccheda 2): &ldquo;The pure knower of the presentational field merely witnesses these beginningless modifications of the impure actor, the mind.&ldquo;1 तथा तेनैव शुद्धस्यापि ज्ञातृत्वमप्युदाहृतम् । ज्ञानं च नित्यस्य स्वाभाविकधर्मत्वान् नित्यम् । अत एव न विक्रियात्मकमपि ।

Moreover, by the very same statement it is further shown that the capacity to know [jñātṛtva, quality no. 18] also belongs even to the pure ātmā [by virtue of its being a knower of the pre- sentational field]. And this cognitive capacity, being a natural attribute of the eternal self, is also eternal and thus does not undergo modifications.

with Knowership and Agency
Because the body is seen to have agency [kartṛtva, quality no. 19] as a result of its relation to the [individual] conscious being, and because inert objects are also acknowledged as some- times exhibiting agency due to the presence of the indwelling [Supreme] consciousness, in accordance with the statement, &ldquo;without whom nothing is accomplished,&rdquo; [it is concluded that] agency ensues only from the pure [i.e., only from the individual or from the Supreme Consciousness]. Thus, it is said: &ldquo;Being infused with whose [conscious] portion, the body, senses, vital force, mind, and intellect perform their respective functions&rdquo; (SB 6.16.24)2
तत् तूपाधिप्राधान्येन प्रवर्तमानमुपाधिधर्मत्वेन व्यपदिश्यते । यथा “कार्यकारणकर्तृत्वे कारणं प्रकृतिं विदुः” (भा० ३।२६।८) इत्यादौ । परमात्मप्राधान्येन प्रवर्तमानं तु निरुपा- धिकमेवेत्याह (भा० ११ । २५।२६) -
When this agency comes about primarily due to the adjuncts (upädhis), it is said to be an attribute of the adjuncts, as is stated, &ldquo;The cause of agency in the body and senses is known to be prakṛti&rdquo; (SB 3.26.8). When, however, agency comes about pre- dominantly due to Paramātmā, it is free from those adjuncts (nirupadhi) [meaning that it is transcendental]. As Bhagavan Kṛṣṇa said:

II The Ontology of the Jiva - Tatastha-sakti
Commentary] yoga oved of nose at ybod ad eansose anobanos [[subtvibat ads of noticed at to lands as [er.on THE PURE JIVA is intrinsically endowed with cognitive capacity (jñātṛtva) and agency (kartṛtva). He is the witness of the actions of the mind and body and thus has the capacity to know. It is not that knowership is acquired only when the jiva is bound by the material body. Cognitive awareness is a natural characteristic of the jiva. Since the jiva is eternal, its cognitive awareness is also eternal by the principle, nityam gatam nityam, &ldquo;The attributes of an eternal object are also eternal.&rdquo; ada org alliant bas brim sorol
Like knowership, agency is also an eternal attribute of the jiva. The material body does not have independent agency. The body is inert and acquires its awareness and capacity to act from the con- scious self. When it is said that the body is the agent of actions, it is meant only in a secondary sense.
ab In Bhagavad Gita, Bhagavan Śrī Kṛṣṇa affirms that a person deluded by the separate self-sense (ahankara) thinks himself to be the doer, although all actions are effected by the gunas of prakṛti (3.27). But even in this statement, it should also be noted that if the jiva did not have agency as part of its intrinsic nature, he would not be able to think of himself as the doer. Thinking is also an action, and so by saying, &ldquo;he thinks himself to be the doer,&rdquo; Kṛṣṇa implies that the pure self has agency.
The agency of the pure self is also stated in Brahma-sutra (2.3.31): &ldquo;The self must be an agent, because then only the scripture can be purposeful.&rdquo; If the self had no agency, and if agency belonged only to prakṛti, then the injunctions of scripture would become futile, because they would not be applicable to anyone. For example, in Bhagavad Gitä (18.65), Śrī Kṛṣṇa commands Arjuna to become His devotee. If the self of Arjuna were devoid of agency, and if the body alone possessed such quality, then Kṛṣṇa&rsquo;s instruction would be meaningless. Kṛṣṇa is not requesting the material body to become His devotee, yet, if the self were deprived of agency, it could not

35 The Jiva Is Eternal, Unblemished, and Endowed

become a devotee. Since Kṛṣṇa&rsquo;s statement is made in full knowl- edge, it cannot be futile. Consequently, it must be accepted that the self has agency. Agency also implies will. An agent can choose to follow an injunction or not. If an agent lacked the capacity of choice, and were thus deprived even of the possibility of rejecting an injunction, there would be no need for such injunctions in the first place. The very word injunction would be rendered obsolete.
Śrī Jiva goes on to explain that when an action is undertaken for the pleasure of the body and senses, then the action is considered to be material, i.e., under the gunas of prakṛti. If, however, the action is performed for the pleasure of the Supreme Person, it is nirguna, or beyond the material qualities. From this, it must be concluded that action is possible for the jiva even in the liberated state.
In the principal verse of this section (SB 11.25.26), although it is said that an agent may be sättvika, rājasika, or tāmasika, it should be understood that it is only the activity that is characterized by those qualities and not the pure agent, or jiva. The physical body is said to be the immediate agent. The body is not just sättvika, rājasika, or tāmasika alone, but a combination of all three gunas. There is a rule that an injunction or prohibition is first applied to a qualified object, and if that is not possible, then it is to be applied to its quality or modifier? Because the agent (i.e., the pure self) who is qualified by the activity cannot be colored by the gunas, it is only the activity that is described as sättvika, and so on. yaad of 98 asall owd sas

Next, Śrī Jiva explains that experiential capacity or affectivity (bhoktṛtva) is inherent in the ātmā.

As Bhagavan Kapila says in the same section of the Third Canto [referred to above]: &ldquo;[Know] the purusa, who is transcendental to prakṛti [to be the cause] in experiencing happiness and misery&rdquo; (SB 3.26.8).

TO EXPERIENCE ENJOYMENT OR SUFFERING, one has to be con- scious. Therefore, the material body and mind, being inert, cannot be the subject of experience. The body is sometimes said to be the agent, because actions occur through the body with the help of the mind and senses. Experiential capacity, however, is nothing but

the awareness of the feelings of happiness and misery, for which there must be a conscious being. Therefore, experiential capacity cannot belong to the inert body or mind.art even of the material
Here it may be noted that just as all actions occur in the physical body, the senses, and the mind, so too the feelings of happiness and misery are also experienced in the mind. This is the common expe- rience of all human beings in life. As was explained earlier, every experience is a form of citta-vṛtti, a state or modification of the mind. Why then does Bhagavan Kapila make a distinction between agency and experience, relegating the first to prakṛti and the sec- ond to the puruşa (the conscious self)? The ultimate cause for both is the purusa, but while action, and hence agency, is visible even in the material body, feelings are deeper and more subtle, being experienced only within the mind. Moreover, it is obvious that a machine that is capable of performing some work cannot have feel- ings. The body is comparable to a machine that carries the puruşa (GĪTĀ 15.7).

NEXT TO BE EXPLAINED is the meaning of paramätmaika-seṣatva- svabhāva, i.e., &ldquo;the jiva is by nature the unitary, irreducible remainder of Paramātmā&rdquo; [quality no. 21]. In the compound paramātmaika-seṣatva-svabhava, the word eka (&ldquo;a unit&rdquo;) refers to an entity who is other than, or distinct from, Paramātmā, and the word śeşa (&ldquo;remainder,&rdquo; &ldquo;residue&rdquo;) means &ldquo;a part.&rdquo; That entity who is both a distinct unit (eka) and an irreducible part (śeşa) is eka-sesa, a part of Paramātmā that is yet different from Him. A unitary, or integrated, part of Paramātmā is known as paramātmaika-śeșa, and its existential condition (bhava) is called paramätmaika-seṣatva. So, that which has this condi- tion as its intrinsic nature (svabhava) is called paramātmaika- śeşatva-svabhāva [referring to the jiva]. Moreover, this is its per- manent state of being (sarvada), implying that such is the case even in the liberated state. The jiva has this intrinsic nature by its very own inner constitution (svarüpata eva), meaning that it is not the outcome of some covering or limitation (pariccheda) [on Brahman by māyā]. dental cap

37 The Jiva Is an Integrated Part of Paramātmā
By virtue of Paramātmā&rsquo;s natural inconceivable potency, the jiva is by nature like a particle of His rays, but in its conditioned state, it becomes to a certain degree a part even of the material energy, prakṛti (prakṛti-seṣatvam api). This is the [double] sense of the word svataḥ, &ldquo;by its own inner constitution&rdquo; [in the verses of Jāmātṛ Muni in Anuccheda 19].

The word kṣetrajña in SB 5.11.12 is also used for the pure self, since the word kṣetra in the compound functions merely as an inci- dental distinguishing mark (upalakṣaṇa) [for the pure self, and hence is not applicable in its primary sense]

In this way, although the jiva is an energy, it is distinct from the other two [intrinsic and extrinsic] due to being intermediately situated (taṭastha). It is intermediate because it cannot be sub- sumed under either of the other two categories. The reason for this is that it is superior to the māyā energy; [but at the same time,] it is subject to the defect of being overpowered by igno- rance, which does not influence Paramātmā. Although the jiva is the energy of Paramātmā, the latter is not tainted by [māyā, or ignorance, like the jiva], just as the sun rays in a particular area may be covered by an object that shades them from view,

The idea here is similar to that conveyed by the phrase &ldquo;the village in the Ganges,&rdquo; which does not literally mean that the village is in the water but on the shore.

Ignorance is the cause of the perception of difference (bheda), which here refers to cognitive awareness of distinctions (visesa) based on the unique characteristics by which individuals are defined, such as those that determine the nature of a god, a human being, or a lower creature. Even if this ignorance were destroyed, who would be able to render non-existent (asanta) the innate (svabhävika) difference between the jiva (ātmā) and Paramātmā [here indicated by the word brahman]? In other words, everyone would affirm that their difference does indeed exist.

Because the principle to be predicated in the subsequent part [of the sentence] is the negation of the &ldquo;non-existence&rdquo; (na-asanta) of distinction [between the jiva and Paramātmā], any contrary interpretation would certainly be a stretch of the imagination.13 Thus, because the jiva is the inherent (svabhävika) energy of Paramātmā, it is never divorced from its constitutional nature of being an integrated part of Him, even in the liberated state. Therefore, in final liberation, which is characterized by estab- lishment in the self&rsquo;s intrinsic identity (svarupa) after being freed from ignorance, the merging of the self in the Absolute actually refers to entrance into the state of identity with the nature and qualities of Bhagavan, as is seen from the Śruti statements such as, &ldquo;The illuminated seer, free from the condi- tioned state, attains the supreme sameness (paramam samyam)&rdquo; (MUU 3.1.3), and from the words of the Gitā:

It has, therefore, been established that the jiva is the potency of Paramātmā. Sometimes the two are described as being with- out distinction, because (1) there is mutual interpenetration of energy and energetic; (2) energy cannot exist without its ener- getic source; and (3) energy and energetic are nondistinct from 15 idaṁ jñānam upăśritya mama sadharmyam agatähtis, stala benott

the point of view that both are of the nature of consciousness. [Nevertheless,] it is also not improper to describe them as dif- ferent, because varieties of energy can be seen even in a single object.

On the other hand, the followers of Sri Ramanujācārya consider statements portraying the nondifference of the jiva and Param- ātmā - who are distinct, nonetheless, as the seat (adhiṣṭhāna) and its occupier (adhiṣṭhātṛ) - to be comparable to the use of a word like &ldquo;cow&rdquo; for both an individual as well as its universal class.

Such statements are also spoken only to nourish the view of non- difference in those who desire jñāna, [and do not mean] that the jiva is factually a reflection. This is because accepting the jiva as a reflection [of Brahman] is contrary even to the opin- ion of the preceptor of the radical nondualists [Sankara], on the basis of the sutra, &ldquo;But there is no &lsquo;suchness&rsquo; (tathatva) [of Brah- man, i.e., no state of Brahman being like the reflected sun or the demarcated earth], because of the non-apprehension (agraha- nāt) [of Brahman&rsquo;s remoteness from the reflecting medium or delimitability by any circumscription], as in the case of water [which is remote from the sun or which demarcates the earth]&rdquo; (VS 3.2.19).22

Commentary
II The Ontology of the Jiva - Taṭastha-sakti
anong unit] and buk (basi botonamsh ghof (os.s.sev) &ldquo;[bellati
JĀMĀTṚ MUNI STATED that the jiva is by nature an integrated part of Paramātmā (paramātmaika-seṣatva-svabhava). This is the jiva&rsquo;s eternal constitutional identity and not merely an adventitious con- dition arising only in the conditioned state. The Advaitavādīs pro- pose that the jiva&rsquo;s separate individuality is not an eternal state, for when liberated, it is directly Brahman and thus not a part of Param- ātmā. This would make the path of bhakti only a means to liberation, which is not the Bhagavatam conclusion. Therefore, in this section, Śri Jiva establishes that the jiva is eternally part of Paramātmā, even
jiva is eternally part of Paramātmā
in the liberated state.
It was earlier explained that Paramātmā is an expansion of Bhagavan, whose purpose is to regulate the jiva and the mate- rial energy (Anuccheda 1). Bhagavan has three types of energies, namely, the intrinsic, extrinsic, and intermediary. The jiva is part of the intermediary energy of Paramātmā.
Paramātmā is like the sun and the jiva like a ray-particle, raśmi- paramāņu. It is interesting to note that Śrī Jiva Gosvāmī uses these words, indicating that the jiva is both a particle (paramāņu) and a wave (raśmi), simultaneously. It also means that it is both sub- stance and energy, for which reason he uses the words dravya (matter) and sakti (energy) 25
The Advaitavādīs consider the jiva to exist only in the condi- tioned state, under the influence of avidya. But Śrī Jiva cites two verses (VP 6.7.61, 63) to refute this, because if the jiva were to merge into Brahman upon liberation, it would be wrong to count it as one of Visņu&rsquo;s three distinct energies. Moreover, in GĪTĀ 15.7, Śrī Kṛṣṇa calls the jiva His eternal part. If the jiva existed only in the conditioned state, it would be improper to define it as an eternal part, because it would cease to be so when liberated. Furthermore, in GĪTĀ 7.5, Kṛṣṇa specifically counts the jiva as a separate energy, superior to and distinct from the inferior material energy.
25 The word dravya (matter) here does not signify material objects per se, but any substance that is the substratum of qualities. In this sense, the ātmā may be regarded as spiritual &ldquo;matter.&rdquo; oddiy on-aid unto other ohn

37 The Jiva Is an Integrated Part of Paramātmā
The word kṣetrajña in SB 5.11.12 refers to the self in either the conditioned or pure states of existence. Literally, it means &ldquo;one who knows or witnesses a kṣetra, or body.&rdquo; Kṣetrajñas are of two types, the individual living being and Paramātmā. The first of these exists in two states, namely, conditioned and liberated. Usually, the word kṣetrajña is used for the conditioned jiva. But in the above- cited verse, it indicates the pure self. In such a case, the kṣetra, or body, is but an incidental distinguishing mark (upalakṣaṇa) for the pure self. An upalakṣaṇa is defined as an incidental mark, which although not intrinsic to an object, nevertheless serves to distin- guish it from other objects.26 The body indicates the presence of the ātmā, but it is not a permanent or intrinsic part of the ātmā, which, by contrast, is eternal. Therefore, the living body is only an indicator of the ātmā.-oreans
The jiva is called the intermediary energy (taṭastha-sakti) because it cannot be subsumed under either of the other two cate- gories. Being conscious, it cannot be part of the material, or extrin- sic, energy, and being influenced by maya, it cannot be counted within the intrinsic energy or in the same category as Paramātmā, who is ever transcendental to māyā.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="8">
<li>Thus, the difference between the jiva and Paramātmā is innate (svabhävika), both in the conditioned as well as the liberated states. This is supported by Visnu Purana (6.7.94), which states that even when the perception of distinction caused by ignorance has been dispelled, no one can remove the distinction between the jiva and Paramātmā in the liberated state:ab
Even if the ignorance that produces the perception of differ- ence were completely destroyed, who could render non-existent (asanta) the difference between the [individual] self and Brahman? (VP 6.7.94)27

would conceive a difference (bhedam kaḥ karisyati) between the individual self and Brahman when it is non-existent (asanta)?&rdquo; This reading, however, would be improper. In any sentence, the predi- cate is that which is unknown, meaning that it provides new infor- mation about the subject, which is already known or stated. The first line reminds us of our empirical experience that we perceive a difference between subject and object, or between the seer and the seen, and we also conceive a difference between the apparently sep- arate self and God. The cause of this apparent duality is ignorance. What is not known is what happens to the difference between the true self (the ātmā) and Brahman when ignorance is dispelled.g
In the latter part of the verse, non-existence is being predicated of the difference between the self and Brahman, but the question, &ldquo;Who could render this difference non-existent?&rdquo; clearly intends the negation of the non-existence of difference (na-asanta). If, however, we read asanta (&ldquo;non-existent&rdquo;) as an adjective qualify- ing the difference, indicating that the difference is inherently or naturally non-existent, then the sentence construction becomes problematic, being read as, &ldquo;Who would create a non-existent bheda, or distinction, between the ātmā and Brahman?&ldquo;28 There- fore, this verse must be seen to affirm that the difference between the individual self and the Supreme Self continues to exist even in the liberated state. (a) ungry yd behoqque ab aldr
This is in consonance with GITA 15.7, which says that the jiva is an eternal part of Paramātmā. In the liberated state, being free of ignorance, the jiva shares an identity of nature (sadharmya) with Brahman or Paramātmā. This does not mean that the jiva is Brah- man in all respects, but only that it has tād-atmya, or oneness of nature, with Brahman. In Vedanta, the concept of tad-atmya is con- sidered as bheda-sahisnu, or accommodative of some difference.29
28 Even if the second reading is admitted, it would signify the following: &ldquo;Who on would conceive a non-existent distinction between Brahman and the liberated
ātmā, when the ignorance that gives rise to distinctions [such as being a deva and so on] is completely destroyed?&rdquo; In the liberated state, the ātmā is devoid of designations, such as being a deva, a human being, and so on. It is of the same conscious nature as Brahman and in this sense is nondistinct from Brahman. 29 bheda-sahiṣṇur abhedas tād-atmyam iti kecid vedantina āhuḥ (Nyāya-kośa: 328)

37 The Jiva Is an Integrated Part of Paramātmā
The jiva is an energy, and Brahman is the energetic. The jiva is within Paramātmā, and Paramātmā is within the jiva. The jiva cannot exist independently of Paramātmā, and Paramātmā has no meaning without the jiva. It is for this reason that the jiva and Brahman are sometimes said to be one.bod ad ni enottoillbom vd yd
Śrī Rāmānujācārya considers the oneness of the jiva with Brah- man to be like that of an individual object with its universal class.30 An individual object, such as a cow, is the substratum for its class, &ldquo;cowness.&rdquo; The word &ldquo;cow&rdquo; refers to both the cow as well as the cowness inherent in it, even though the individual cow is different from its universal class of cowness. Therefore, Param- ātmā is present in everything, whereas everything else is but His attribute. This oneness is evidently not the same oneness spoken of in Advaitavada, where there are no attributes, or prakāra, in Brahman. at noise aritmi bati(8.0.g) serv matovopora ad
Why then does scripture (sastra) speak of both oneness and difference? Śrī Jiva Gosvāmī reasons that the scriptures do so in order to instruct two different kinds of people, namely, jñānīs and bhaktas. Jñānis aspire to realize their oneness with the Absolute, whereas the bhaktas long for loving exchanges with Bhagavan. It should again be noted that the oneness spoken of in the scriptures is not absolute identity, to svēИ asvagada balsto
Advaitavādīs may object that there are some statements in the śāstras that describe the jiva as a mere reflection of the Supreme. This would mean that the jiva has no independent existence in the ultimate sense. But this also is untrue, for it has already been stated that the jiva is an eternal part of the Supreme Self. Such statements that speak of the jiva as a mere reflection or as one with Brahman are provided only to nourish the sentiments of the adherents of the jñāna-marga. They cannot mean that the jiva is a reflection of Paramātmā in the real sense, for Brahma-sutra (3.2.19) denies this,

and even Śrī Śankarācārya, while commenting on the latter, argues that Brahman, being incorporeal and omnipresent, is incapable of being reflected.1 The example of a reflection is given to show that the ātmā is dependent on Paramātmā and that it is not influenced by modifications in the body32 The conclusion is that the jiva is an eternal part of Paramātmā.
The Bhāgavata Purana verse (4.28.63) cited in this anuccheda is part of an allegory related by sage Narada to King Pracinabarhi. The present verse is spoken by a brahmana to Vaidarbhi, who was bemoaning the death of her husband. The brāhmaṇa represents Paramātmā, and Vaidarbhi, a conditioned self. The example of a reflection in this verse is to show the intimacy between the jiva and Paramātmā. Paramātmā is a friend of the jiva, as Kṛṣṇa states in GĪTĀ 5.29, &ldquo;I am the friend of all living beings.&rdquo;
The Bhagavatam verse (3.6.8) 33 cited in this section is spoken by sage Maitreya to Vidura. It describes the cosmic being (Hiranya- garbha) who is the Self for all living beings in the universe. The gross universal form, called Virat, consists of twenty-three ele- ments, which include mahat-tattva, ahankara, manas, the ten senses, the five tan-matras, and the five mahābhūtas. The sub- tle universal form is Hiranyagarbha, within which all jivas are contained. Bhagavan Nārāyaṇa, or Paramātmā, enters the jīvas by His kriya-sakti, awakens their karmic inheritances, and com- bines the elements. The cosmic being is called an avatara in this verse because Bhagavan Nārāyaṇa manifests Himself therein as Garbhodakaśāyi Viṣṇu.

THE COMPOUND RAŚMI-PARAMĀŅU (a ray-particle), used here to describe the jiva, was discussed in the previous section. The word vyaşți means &ldquo;individual,&rdquo; whereas samaşți means &ldquo;aggregate.&rdquo; A jiva who encompasses all the jivas of a particular universe within his body and is thus equipped with a self-concept (i.e., ego) corre- sponding to the aggregate of all beings is called samasti-jiva. The Kaustubha gem that Bhagavan wears on His chest is also a samaşti- jiva because it is the embodiment of the taṭastha-sakti. At the end of the previous anuccheda, Śrī Jiva demonstrated that the aggre- gate self (samaşți-jiva) belongs to Paramātmā as His part. To com- plement that discussion, Jīva now shows that the individuated self (vyaşți-jiva), too, is a part of Paramātmā. Thus, the discussion here is a continuation of the subject of the previous anuccheda, namely, paramātmaika-seṣatva-svabhāva.
In the next anuccheda, Śrī Jīva shows that the jiva is part of Paramātmā because of being His energy.laefio pasien play

THE ŚRUTIS EXPLAIN that the jivas are integrated parts of Param- ātmā because they are a potency belonging to Him: &ldquo;The Vedas speak of the puruşa, or the conscious being, dwelling in these bodies that are shaped by its own actions, as a part of You and as made out of You, the repository of unlimited potencies. In real- ity, however, the conscious being is without external or internal covering&rdquo; (SB 10.87.20) ignora

In the adjectival phrase &ldquo;without external or internal cover- ing&rdquo; (abahir-antar-asamvarana), the word &ldquo;external&rdquo; (bahir) refers to the outwardly existing [or non-essential] effects, and the word &ldquo;internal&rdquo; (antar), to the inwardly existing [or essen- tial] causes. That the purușa is free from both of these cov- erings means that it is untouched either by cause or effect. &ldquo;Made a part&rdquo; (amsa-kṛta) [simply] means a part. &ldquo;The repos- itory of unlimited potencies&rdquo; (akhila-śakti-dhṛta), meaning &ldquo;He

By making it clear that the jiva is a part only of that [form of God] which is qualified by the jiva potency [i.e., Paramātmā], and not of the pure, or Absolute, [i.e., not of Bhagavan directly, who is without the attribute of the jiva potency], the Śrutis are here explaining that the jiva is an integrated part of Paramātmā specifically by virtue of being His energy.

Now [the jiva&rsquo;s] intermediary status (taṭasthatva) has been clearly depicted, as in verse SB 10.87.38 (Anuccheda 23): &ldquo;Yet the jiva, due to the influence of māyā, embraces ignorance,&rsquo; because [according to this statement] it cannot be counted as part of either the intrinsic or extrinsic potencies.sibod 1891 al asianstoq batimilnu la notizogoz odtwoX 3o two abam Ismetni ro Istetxe juodaiwai grisd arobaros ad revewody Commentary

IN THIS ANUCCHEDA, Śrī Jīva refers to the prayers of the personi- fied Vedas to further establish that the jiva is a part of Paramātmā. He also clarifies that the jiva is not a part of Bhagavan directly, whom he refers to by the word śuddha, &ldquo;the pure or Absolute,&rdquo; but of Paramātmā, who is endowed with the jiva-sakti. The word &ldquo;pure&rdquo; (suddha) here is to be understood as referring to the origi- nal primal source; otherwise, taking it in its conventional or pop- ular sense would imply that Paramātmā is impure. It also signi- fies that Bhagavan, being directly involved only with His intrinsic potency, is utterly transcendental to prakṛti, whereas Paramātmā,

Here a doubt may be raised. In GĪTĀ 15.7, Kṛṣṇa says that the jiva is a part of Him alone (mama eva aṁśaḥ). Kṛṣṇa is Svayam Bhaga- vän, God in His own original form and essence, the fountainhead of all avatāras. Then why does Jiva Gosvāmi say that the jiva is part of Paramātmā and not of Kṛṣṇa? In fact, however, there is no contra- diction in the two statements. The jiva is a part of Paramātmā, and Paramātmā is an expansion of Kṛṣṇa. So, by the principle of tran- sitivity, the jiva is also a part of Kṛṣṇa. The indeclinable &ldquo;only&rdquo; (in mama eva) is to stress that the jiva is not a part of Brahma, Rudra, or any other god. Alternatively, the word &ldquo;only&rdquo; (eva) may be taken as qualifying the word amsa (part), in which case it would mean that in relation to Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the jiva is only a part and thus neither equal to nor nondifferent from Him.
6693
Jiva Gosvāmi makes it clear that the jiva is not a part in the lit- eral sense, like a drop of water is to the ocean. In other words, it is not a part whose removal would reduce or alter the Whole in some way. It is a part simply because it belongs to one of the potencies of Paramātmā. Moreover, because the jiva is a conscious being, it cannot be part of the extrinsic energy, but because it comes under the influence of māyā, or ignorance, it does not belong to the intrin- sic potency. Therefore, it belongs to the intermediate category, or tatastha energy.
This completes the explanation of the 21 characteristics of the jīva listed by Jāmātṛ Muni in Anuccheda 19. On the basis of those verses, Śrī Jiva Prabhu has established that the jiva is conscious, real, eternal, and a part of Paramātmā. The jīva is inherently endowed with the capacity to know, act, will, and experience. This refutes the concept of its being absolutely identical with Brahman, as propounded by Advaitavada.

There are, however, many statements in the Bhāgavatam and other scriptures that seem to establish the individual self as iden- tical with the Supreme Self. In the three following anucchedas,

Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi offers an explanation for such statements. First in Anuccheda 40, we learn that affirmations of nondifference are in general meant for those who aspire for jñāna. In Anuccheda 41, we are then reminded of the three reasons given in Anuccheda 37 to account for such affirmations, expressed there in these words: &ldquo;It has, therefore, been established that the jiva is the potency of Paramātmā. Sometimes the two are described as being with- out distinction because, (1) there is mutual interpenetration of energy and energetic; (2) energy cannot exist without its ener- getic source; and (3) energy and energetic are nondistinct from the point of view that both are of the nature of consciousness.&rdquo; In the same anuccheda, Jīva Gosvāmi then goes on to discuss the first reason, the interpenetration of energy and energetic or of cause and effect. In Anuccheda 42, he elaborates on the second and third reasons for the statements of nondistinction. boo

Therefore, both types of statements are found in the scriptures in relation to the jiva and Paramātmā.

II The Ontology of the Jiva - Taṭastha-sakti
Adherents of the popular jñāna-marga, known as Advaitavāda (radical nondualism or absolute monism), aspire to realize their oneness with Brahman. They argue that the cause is real and that the effect is merely the cause appearing as effect. For them, the jiva is really Brahman, and so they interpret statements of nondiffer- ence in an absolute or primary sense. Śrī Jīva does not subscribe to such a view, however, and offers an alternate explanation based on the oneness of cause and effect, while simultaneously accepting some difference between them. cannot exist without its ener
According to Śri Jiva, although there is no absolute oneness between God and the individual self, there is still a possibility of realizing an identity with Brahman by following the path of direct intuitive insight (jñāna-märga). This path is accepted by the Bhāga- vata Purana, but should not be confused with the Advaitavada of Śankara, which, as Jiva will show, finds no place in the scriptures.
In Bhagavad Gita (4.11), Krsna says that He reveals Himself to every aspirant exactly in accordance with the core disposition of their surrender or faith. He provides support to all by maintain- ing their respective faith. Therefore, He has both qualified (i.e., personal) and unqualified (i.e., impersonal) features. His personal form, however, involves a higher degree of complexity and com- pletion, implicitly enfolding the impersonal feature within it. The present verse is spoken keeping the followers of the jñāna path in mind.

PREVIOUSLY [IN ANUCCHEDA 37], three reasons were given [for statements describing the jiva and Paramātmā as nondifferent]. According to the principle enunciated there, the first of these suggests that from the intent to speak of the mutual interpene- tration of all the phenomenal evolutes (tattvas) [of primordial nature as a whole], their oneness, or identity (aikya), is appar- ently seen to be the case. Similarly, from the wish to express that the energy known as the jiva interpenetrates its energetic source, Paramātmā, the reason for upholding their identity can be deduced. To this end, then, Bhagavan Kṛṣṇa speaks [the following verse]: structing King Pri inabarhi through an

Commentary
Inseparability and Nondistinction
AFTER STATING, in the previous anuccheda, that the scriptural dec- larations of oneness are meant for those pursuing jñāna-märga, in this and the next anuccheda, Śrī Jiva elaborates on the three reasons given in Section 37 to account for the affirmations of nondifference. The first of these arguments is that the jiva and Paramātmā inhere in one another and so can be counted either as one or as distinct, according to the intent of the speaker.
In the Indian schools of philosophy and theology (darśanas), dif- ferent seers have attempted to explain reality by positing differ- ent numbers of tattvas, or ontological categories of being. San- khya is probably the most popular system for such enumeration of the tattvas. It is one of the oldest philosophical schools, and there have been many different ācāryas of Sankhya, each of whom has explained the system slightly differently, proposing varying num- bers of tattvas. In the Third Canto, Chapter 26, Bhagavan Kapila enumerates 27 tattvas, whereas in Chapter 13 of the Gītā, Bhagavān Śrī Kṛṣṇa mentions only 26. Contrastingly, in a verse (SB 11.19.14)2 from an earlier part of the same discussion that is continued in this anuccheda, Kṛṣṇa lists 28 tattvas. Keeping all this in mind, Uddhava asks Śrī Kṛṣṇa about the number of tattvas, or evolutes, manifest- ing from prakṛti. He inquires as to why different sages have pro- posed different enumerations. Bhagavan Kṛṣṇa speaks the present verse (SB 11.22.7) as part of His response.

speaker&rsquo;s intent either to count an evolute separately or to include it with its cause. Śrī Jiva refers to this principle to show the oneness of the jiva with Paramātmā. Such statements are made for the fol- lowers of the jñāna path who aspire to realize the Brahman aspect of the Absolute.

Commentary
TOWARD THE END OF ANUCCHEDA 37, Jiva Gosvāmi offers three reasons to explain the intent behind scriptural statements advo- cating the nondistinction of the jiva and Paramātmā (or Brahman). The first of these - the interpenetration of energy and energetic- was discussed in the last anuccheda. Now, in this section, Jiva Gosvāmi highlights the second and third reasons, which may be summed up, respectively, as the inseparability of energy and ener- getic source, and the nondistinction in the matter of conscious
nature.
Whelimi
In the verse prior to this one (SB 11.22.10, see Anuccheda 44), Bhagavan Kṛṣṇa informs Uddhava that the jiva is captivated by beginningless ignorance and cannot be liberated without the help of a person who is a realized knower of the truth. This illustrates the main difference between the jiva and Paramātmā, who is never bound by māyā. Therefore, the number of ontological cat- egories should be 26, if both the jiva and Paramātmā are counted separately? alsaqe saphelusion als imav stadbire omo as to proslin at exed) ydw to noltasup sri of sanoqass 2 The 26 tattvas, or ontological categories, are the jiva, Paramātmā, primordialgol ar nature as a whole (prakṛti), cosmic, or collective, intellect (mahat), ego, or the

42 Inseparability and Nondistinction of the Jiva and Paramātmā
Co The question is then raised, &ldquo;So why do some say that there are 25 ontological categories?&rdquo; Kṛṣṇa responds with the present verse: &ldquo;They do so by counting the jiva and Paramātmā as one, due to their similarity as conscious beings (purusa).&rdquo; Jiva Gosvāmi concludes that the relation of oneness between the jiva and Paramātmā, as energy and energetic, is shown by their similarity and nondistinc- tion as conscious beings. Moreover, from this relation, their insep- arability is also evident. Thus, from this brief passage, Śrī Jiva is able to deduce both the inseparability of energy and energetic, and their nondistinction in terms of conscious nature, the second and third reasons referred to earlier.

Sovereignty (sväräjya) means [the four kinds of devotional] liberation, such as sārṣṭi, or the liberated state of participation in opulence similar to that of Bhagavan.

e of knowledge&rdquo; (junda tinct both from anch
IN SECTION 37, Śrī Jiva argued that the reason why scriptures describe the jiva sometimes as one with Paramātmā and some- times as distinct from Him is that such contrasting instructions are actually intended for two different types of spiritual aspirants. In the two previous sections (Anucchedas 41-42), Śrī Jīva cited state- ments from the Bhāgavatam that laid stress on the identity of the jīva and Paramātmā, explaining that their purpose is to provide a basis for those who desire brahma-jñāna. Now he discusses other verses that speak of their distinction to serve as a foundation for bhakti.

norance, then
For those who are sincerely drawn to bhakti, knowledge of the distinction between the individual self and God is essential, for without it there can be no bhakti. Devotion, involving the flow of love and service between lover and beloved, cannot find support in singularity. Rather, devotion implies a distinction between its ves- sel (āśraya) and its object (visaya). The former is the jiva, the latter,
former is a miss Bhagavan.ened
The present verse was spoken by Bhagavan Viṣṇu to His son Brahma at the beginning of a new creation cycle. It is significant to note that Bhagavan instructed the first being of the universe on the distinction between Himself and the jiva, and not on their oneness. He, thus, favors bhakti over jñāna.

Śrīdhara Svāmi also comments: &ldquo;[Knowledge of the self] is not possible by one&rsquo;s own endeavor (svataḥ), but is possible to be received from another.

28644 The Logic of the Distinction between the Jiva and Paramātmā
Iśvara&rsquo;s status of being &ldquo;the bestower of knowledge&rdquo; (jñānada- tva) here informs us that He is distinct both from such knowl- edge and its knower. In a similar vein, Uddhava says further on [in this chapter of the Bhagavatam]: &ldquo;The jivas&rsquo; knowledge verily comes from you, and it is stolen away by Your potency [of māyā]&rdquo; (SB 11.22.28)?
अत्र यदि जीवाज्ञानकल्पितमेव तस्य परमेश्वरत्वं स्यात् तर्हि स्थाणुपुरुषवत् तस्य ज्ञान- दत्वमपि न स्यादित्यतः सत्य एव जीवेश्वरभेद इत्येवं श्रीमदीश्वरेणैव स्वयं स्वस्य पारम- र्थिकेश्वराभिमानित्वेनैवास्तित्वं मूढान् प्रति बोधितमिति स्पष्टम् ।
If Iśvara&rsquo;s supremacy (parameśvaratva) is considered to be noth- ing more than an imaginary product of the jiva&rsquo;s ignorance, then His imparting of knowledge (jñānadatva) would also not be fea- sible any more than the &ldquo;humanness&rdquo; of a tree stump mistaken for a man. Consequently, the distinction between the jiva and Iśvara is real. In this way, it is self-evident that it can be only Śrīmad Iśvara Himself, endowed with the transcendental self- identity of being the Supreme Regulator, who thus informs the unenlightened of His existence.

Those who uphold the view that a distinction exists [between the jiva and Paramātmā] accept that [such awareness of] distinc- tion is the result of supreme discrimination (parama-viveka), as indicated in the very same discussion: &ldquo;Whatever views have been put forth [regarding the classification of tattvas] by dif- ferent philosophers in accordance with discriminated wisdom (viveka), we accept as valid, because each assertion is born of its own logical reasoning&rdquo; (SB 11.22.9)3

At the same time, however, they also acknowledge that the occa- sion for such a variety of standpoints in all these cases is due only to Bhagavan&rsquo;s potency (māyā), as expressed in these words: &ldquo;What indeed is difficult to establish for philosophers who put forth their views by accepting My extrinsic potency (māyā)&rdquo; (SB 11.22.4)?4

Revealed sound (Śruti), direct perception (pratyakṣa), tradition (aitihya), and inference (anumāna) are the four means to valid knowledge.

IN ANUCCHEDAS 41 AND 42, Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī substantiated his three rationales for scriptural statements describing the oneness of the jiva and Paramātmā, which he had listed in Anuccheda 37. In Anuccheda 43, he contrasted this view by providing an instance in the Bhāgavatam where Bhagavan explicitly speaks of the distinc- tion between Himself and the jiva. Now, in this anuccheda, Śrī Jiva explains the reason for describing this distinction.
As given here, the primary reason for making this distinction is that the jiva is liable to the influence of Bhagavan&rsquo;s māyā. Kṛṣṇa tells Uddhava (SB 11.22.10) that no one can become enlightened by his own endeavor. One needs the grace of an enlightened person. The reason for this is that the ignorance of the jiva is beginningless, and hence, causeless; it is not the outcome of some particular act on the part of the jiva or Paramātmā. If it were caused, one could get rid of it by removing the cause, but since this is not the case, one can get out of the clutches of maya only by the self-disclosure of revealed truth, transmitted through contact with an enlightened

being. This transmission is made possible exclusively through the agency of surrender. It is in the total dedication of thought, feeling, will, and attention - which surrender to Bhagavan entails - that immediate intuition of the self can be brought to light. Therefore, in Bhagavad Gita (5.15, 7.14), Kṛṣṇa affirms that the deluded self can transcend māyā only through surrender to Him. This means that Iśvara, namely, Paramātmā or Bhagavan, is distinct from the jiva.
Isvara is a real instructor, as in Bhagavad Gita, and is endowed with His own authentic sense of identity. He is not the product of anyone&rsquo;s imagination. Advaita Vedanta claims that Iśvara is not real in the ontological sense, considering Him to be but a concep- tual construct of the jiva imagined under the influence of ignorance. Most modern philosophers also propound that God is an invention of the human brain. It is said in Pañcadaśī:
289
tion
That which is eternal, conscious, and unlimited is Brahman, the only Absolute Reality. That very Brahman has two features, called Iśvara and jiva, which are imagined due to the two upādhis of māyā. (Pañcadasi 3.37)&rsquo;
In this doctrine, the only difference between the jiva and Iśvara is that of their respective upadhis. Iśvara has the upadhi of pure sattva, the jiva that of impure sattva. In essence, both are Brahman, but out of ignorance, the jiva imagines a separate Ïśvara. When the jiva becomes realized, he transcends the conception of God.
Śrī Jiva Gosvāmi challenges that if this were true, then how could Iśvara impart any instructions to the jiva in texts such as Bhagavad Gitä? Sometimes a person looking from afar may mistake a tree trunk for a man in semi-darkness, but just as this imagined man is devoid of factual &ldquo;humanness,&rdquo; so too, an imagined Iśvara would be altogether devoid of the capacity to impart knowledge (jñānadatva) to anyone. But Iśvara does indeed transmit knowl- edge for the jiva&rsquo;s enlightenment, and therefore, the difference between the jiva and Iśvara is real. Moreover, why would Iśvara

In the second part of this anuccheda, Śrī Jīva explains that dif- ferent scholars expound different philosophies under the influ- ence of Bhagavan&rsquo;s māyā. The fact remains, however, that the jivas are not identical to Isvara or Brahman. As a possible objection to this, he cites SB 11.19.17 spoken by Kṛṣṇa. There are four means of valid knowledge (pramaņas) stated in this verse, namely, revealed sound, direct perception, tradition, and inference. By any of these methods, one can come to the conclusion that Brahman is the only reality.qrai ad to lewoveath a as oled od fon bluoda served 300Let us consider each of these in turn, beginning with revealed sound (Śruti). In the Upanisads, it is said, &ldquo;This entire phenom- enal world is indeed Brahman&rdquo; (CHU 3.14.1), and, &ldquo;In this visible world, there is no variety whatsoever&rdquo; (BAU 4.4.19)? From these statements, it is clear that Śruti supports the view that Brahman is the only reality. In regard to perception (pratyakṣa), we directly apprehend, for example, that golden ornaments are nothing but gold. Its names and forms, such as a gold necklace or gold earrings, are temporary appearances of the enduring substance. Thus, it is concluded that the world is nothing other than Brahman, and all names and forms are only temporary appearances.eu&rdquo;.duob&rdquo;
From the point of view of tradition (aitihya), it is widely known that great ācāryas, like Śri Sankara, have subscribed to the view that all is Brahman. Similarly, the same conclusion can also be reached through the following inference (anumana): The universe is unreal (mithya) because it is visible. Anything that is visible is unreal, like the misperception of a rope as a snake. Since the universe is visible, it too is ultimately unreal. This line of argu- ment is an instance of positive inference (anvaya-vyapti). The same point can be argued from the perspective of negative inference (vyatireka-vyāpti) as follows: The world is unreal because it is vis- ible. That which is real is invisible, such as the ātmā. Because the world is visible, it cannot be real. 14 motoroparia sit at benoitnem

AII The Ontology of the Jiva - Taṭastha-saktio
In light of these four pramānas, Kṛṣṇa&rsquo;s statement seems to sup- port the conclusion of Advaitavada. The word vikalpa in this verse is a reference to phenomenal objects, whose existence is a matter of doubt or conceptual construction. It seems that when a person becomes free of all doubt through means of these pramāņas, he becomes indifferent to all duality. This may be taken to mean that the only reality is Brahman and that duality is merely imaginary. belŚrī Jiva concludes, however, that such is not the case. The plu- ralistic world of phenomenal variety is denied as real only from the point of view that it is perishable (naśvara). Consequently, the verse should not be taken as a disavowal of the imperishable transphenomenal variety that exists in the spiritual domain, nor does it negate the distinction between the jiva and Paramātmā. This is evident from the subsequent verse, also spoken by Kṛṣṇa (SB 11.19.18). In that verse, it is clearly stated that all regions of the universe, up to and including the abode of Brahma, are perishable (naśvara). This implies two things. First, the universe is tempo- rary, yet not unreal (mithya), as wrongly concluded by Advaitava- dis. Second, the regions beyond Brahmaloka, i.e., Vaikuntha, are permanent and thus not subject to passing away.
VISTORIST 978
Śrī Jiva explains that the word vikalpa (in SB 11.19.17) means &ldquo;doubt.&rdquo; Thus, the meaning of the verse is that through the insight gained from the four stated pramāņas, one is freed of doubt about the nature of reality. That this interpretation is valid is supported by Kṛṣṇa&rsquo;s recommending the path of bhakti in the verses begin- ning with SB 11.19.19. Even if it is admitted that the previous two verses delineate the path of jñāna, bhakti is to be understood as superior and as the recommended path, because the hermeneuti- cal principle of scriptural interpretation establishes that the item appearing last in a sequence is of greatest significance.

Since, as shown in Anuccheda 19, Jāmātṛ Muni seems to have based his own verses on those of Padma Purana, this seems highly unlikely. Therefore, we have translated upajivya as &ldquo;supportive of,&rdquo; rather than as &ldquo;the basis of.&rdquo;

The syntax [of the three verses, which form a single sentence] is clear. The first verse signifies that the ātmā is eternally unblemished (nitya-nirmala, Anuccheda 35). The word ātmā- nam implies that the jiva is the referent of the pronoun &ldquo;I&rdquo; (aham-artha, Anuccheda 29); otherwise, there would be no perception of the self. The word kevala, &ldquo;a monad,&rdquo; indicates the self&rsquo;s establishment in its own unique identity (eka-rupa- svarupa-bhāk, Anuccheda 28). Prakrteḥ param, &ldquo;beyond material nature,&rdquo; means that it is free from modifications (vikara-rahita, Anuccheda 21). ] in tāmē sgae sdtyd batreqmi

Aṇimāna, &ldquo;atomic,&rdquo; means that it is anu in dimension (Anuccheda 33) and [also] distinct in each body (prati- kṣetre bhinnaḥ, Anuccheda 32). Akhandita, &ldquo;indivisible,&rdquo; signi- fies that it is inherently endowed with the capacities of know- ership (jñātṛtva), agency (kartṛtva), and experiential capacity (bhoktṛtva), because it has potencies, such as consciousness, that are inseparable (avicchinna) from its being (Anucchedas 35-36).
Commentary
IN ANUCCHEDA 19, Śrī Jīva Gosvāmī cited four verses by Jāmātṛ Muni, delineating the intrinsic characteristics of the jiva. He then discussed each of them, supplying references from Bhāga- vata Purāṇa. To conclude his analysis of jiva-tattva, he now refers to three verses spoken by Bhagavan Kapila to His mother Devahūti and shows how they coincide with Jāmātṛ Muni&rsquo;s description. Since the Bhagavata Purana is the highest pramāņa for Śrī Jīva, he summarizes his argument with verses taken from there. In the next anuccheda, he presents other citations from Bhāgavata Purāṇa that match with Jāmātṛ Muni&rsquo;s description of the jiva.

46 Twelve Transcendental Attributes of the Self
The word &ldquo;imperishable&rdquo; (avyaya) means that the jiva is without any degeneration; &ldquo;unitary&rdquo; (eka) means it is one, not a conglom- eration of the body, senses, and so on. Its being the knower of the field (kṣetrajña) signifies that it is inherently endowed with the attributes of knowership, agency, and experiential capacity. It is the shelter (äśraya) of the senses and other faculties. It is free of all modifications (avikriya), because it is inherently endowed with the quality of knowership.
स्वदृक् स्वस्मै स्वयम्प्रकाशः । हेतुः सर्गादिनिमित्तम् । तदुक्तं श्रीसूतेन &quot; हेतुर्जीवोऽस्य सर्गादरविद्याकर्मकारकः” (भा० १२।७।१८) इति । व्यापको व्याप्तिशीलः । असङ्गी अनावृतश्च स्वतःप्रकाशरूपत्वात् ।
The word &ldquo;self-witnessing&rdquo; (sva-drk) refers to its self-awareness and self-luminosity (svasmai svayam-prakāśaḥ, Anuccheda 27). It is the cause (hetu) behind the creation and so on, as stated by Śri Sūta, &ldquo;The jiva, the agent of actions performed in ignorance, is the cause of this creation&rdquo; (SB 12.7.18)? The word &ldquo;pervasive&rdquo; (vyapaka) means that the jiva has the capacity to pervade [the body]. It is unattached (asangi) and also without any covering (anāvṛta), due to its attribute of being self-effulgent.
“अहम्ममेत्यसद्भावं देहादौ मोहजं त्यजेत्” इति देहाद्यधिकरणकस्य मोहजस्यैव त्यागो न तु स्वरूपभूतस्येत्यहमर्थ इति व्यज्यते ।

The implied meaning [of the second half of the second verse], &ldquo;A wise person should give up the false notions of &lsquo;I&rsquo; and &lsquo;mine,&rsquo; which are a product of delusion rooted in the identification with the body and things related to it,&rdquo; is that one should abandon the false notions of &ldquo;I&rdquo; and &ldquo;mine&rdquo; as attributed to their location (adhikarana) in the body and mind, such notions being the result of delusion alone. On the other hand, however, the authentic intrinsic &ldquo;I&rdquo;-sense related to the true self is not to be given up. This characteristic of the self relates to its being the referent of the pronoun &ldquo;I&rdquo; (aham-artha, Anuccheda 29).

vhod add to noise In this way, some claim that the jiva, being an integrated part of Paramātmā, is of the nature of subtle [immaterial] effulgence (sükṣma-jyoti-rupa). It is specifically for this reason that it has been depicted as a part of the Kaustubha gem. Similarly, in the description of the jiva found in the Prabhasa-khanda of Skanda Purāṇa, it is said:
न तस्य रूपं वर्णा वा प्रमाणं दृश्यते क्वचित् । 9) न शक्यं कथितुं वापि सूक्ष्मश्चानन्तविग्रहः || १५० ।। बालाग्रशतभागस्य शतधा कल्पितस्य च ।

The jiva is finer in dimension than one ten- thousandth part of the tip of a hair, and yet it is eligible for the limitlessness [of liberation]. The yogis, endowed with the eye of wisdom, see it as having a subtle radiance the color of the sun, like a drop of water on a lotus flower, or like a star shining in the sky.

conscious, eternal, changeless, that it possesses intrinsic agency, knowership, and experiential capacity, and that it is the referent of the pronoun &ldquo;I.&rdquo; In spite of all this, the jiva is liable to be influenced by māyā. This analysis completely uproots the Advaitavāda view of the jiva as being nothing other than deluded Brahman, devoid of an authentic intrinsic &ldquo;I&rdquo;-sense.
Śrī Jīva makes the additional comment that the jiva potency is upheld by Bhagavan on His chest in the form of the Kaustubha gem. Śrī Sūta refers to this fact in Bhagavata Purana (12.11.10). In this verse, the Kaustubha gem is referred to as the effulgence of the self, atma-jyoti. This implies that the ātmā is self-effulgent. The fact that it rests on the chest of Bhagavan implies that the pure self is very dear to Him and that it is not part of His intrinsic potency.
This hereby completes the description of the intrinsic charac- teristics of the jiva that began in Anuccheda 19. In the next section, Śri Jiva Gosvāmi will describe two categories of jivas. 21HT MI

IN THIS WAY, there are verily unlimited intermediary poten- cies (taṭastha-saktis), called jivas. They form two groups. One consists of those whose consciousness is turned toward Bhaga- vän (bhagavad-unmukha) without beginning; the other consists of those whose consciousness is turned away from Bhagavan (bhagavat-parān-mukha) with no beginning. This division is according to whether or not they are intrinsically endowed with experiential awareness, or direct knowing, of Bhagavan.

Jivas of the first group are favored by the blessings of Bhaga- vān&rsquo;s intrinsic potency and are His eternal associates, such as Garuda, as stated in the Uttara-khanda of Padma Purana, previ- ously also cited in Bhagavat Sandarbha (Anuccheda 78.1): &ldquo;There are unlimited worlds and beings in the tripad-vibhuti, or the transcendental abode characterized by threefold dimensional- ity of being [i.e., immortality, fearlessness, and all-auspicious worship of the Absolute]. All inhabitants of this realm are of the nature of unalloyed being (śuddha-sattva) and are known as brahmananda-sukha, the joy and bliss of Brahman. They are

all eternal, immutable, and devoid of the lower gunas; they are golden, pure, and brilliant as a million suns. They are all full of Vedic knowledge, divine, and free from the attributes of lust and greed. They relish only the nectar of unalloyed devotional ser- vice to Bhagavan Nārāyaṇa&rsquo;s lotus feet. They are always filled with the bliss of the sweet chanting of the Sama Veda and are effulgent with the Vedic knowledge. They are the personifi- cations of the fivefold worship of Bhagavan&rdquo; (Padma Purana, Uttara-khanda 228.1-4)?

The jivas of the first category [those eternally devoted to Bha- gavān] are also classified as part of the intermediary potency (taṭastha), because the widely acknowledged condition that &ldquo;jiva-hood&rdquo; (jivatva) entails necessarily excludes them from being included in the same category as Ïśvara Himself. gnist

By contrast, the jivas of the second category are those bound to empirical existence, being overpowered by māyā, which takes advantage of their flaw of indifference to Bhagavan. This con- dition is depicted in the Hamsa-guhya-stava: &ldquo;The jiva knows all these [the body, the vital force, and so on] as well as the gunas, but though it is the knower of all these, it does not know the omniscient, unlimited [Bhagavan], whom I worship&rdquo; (SB 6.4.25)?

And also in the Eleventh Canto: &ldquo;A living being who is set apart from Bhagavan becomes absorbed in separativeness (dvitiya). As a consequence, he is overpowered by fear, his conception of being is reversed, and he becomes forgetful of his constitutional position. All this takes place by Bhagavan&rsquo;s extrinsic potency. Therefore, one who is actually wise worships Him by the pro- cess of unalloyed devotion, considering his spiritual teacher as an embodiment of the Divine and as his very self&rdquo; (SB 11.2.37).

And that birth is verily the attainment of the state of empirical selfhood (ādhyā- tmikatva) [in relation to the body], caused by the phenome- nal identification (abhimana) that mistakes the birth of one&rsquo;s limiting conditions (upādhis) for the birth of the self.

No generation of prakṛti or of puruşa ever takes place, because they are both birthless. Rather, the coming into existence of the embodied living beings is like the appearance of bubbles don the surface of water, occurring only when the two [prakṛti via and puruşa] are conjoined together. During dissolution, they enter into You, the Supreme, with all their various names and attributes, just as rivers enter into the sea or just as the nectar of unlimited numbers of flowers is dissolved in honey.

II The Ontology of the Jiva - Taṭastha-śakti
Prakṛti consists of the three gunas [in their equilibrated state]. The puruşa [here means] the jiva in its pure state. Since they are both birthless (aja), they are not created [udbhava, generated]. But those who are equipped with the vital force (asu), namely, the embodied beings (jivas) who are conditioned by their lim- iting adjuncts that provide shape to their sense of empirical selfhood (adhyatmika), are subjected to birth. It is due only to Paramātmā, the cause, who is endowed with both these energies [i.e., prakṛti and puruşa] that the jivas take birth. lieninial

[During the period of dissolution,] the energies (sakti) called the jīvas, who are merged in Paramātmā, are said to be pure because their dispositions (vāsanās) are then dormant due to the dissolu- tion of the modifications of prakṛti. At the time of creation, how- ever, they are conjoined to prakṛti, which is undergoing modifi- cations. Their dispositions being revived, they relapse into the conditioned state and spread forth [i.e., manifest in the world].

Here Svāmi explains that virya means the cit potency; therefore, his commentary confirms that the jiva is a potency of Param- ātmā. Hence, the example [in SB 10.87.31], “ like the appearance of bubbles on the surface of water,&rdquo; is only to illustrate the sud- denness of the jiva&rsquo;s appearance (udbhava) [and not its creation out of a conglomeration of factors].dogo

Consequently, they merge along with their different names and attributes, their various appellations such as &ldquo;gods,&rdquo; as well as their various meritorious and unmer- itorious qualities, into You, the Supreme, meaning Paramātmā, who is referred to by the word &ldquo;Self&rdquo; (sva) in Śruti texts such as, “He enters into the Self ” ( svam apito bhavati, CHU 6.8.1).

O dear one, just as honeybees extract the nectar from variouse] are trees of different shapes and bring them together to produce a single taste [i.e., honey], [and] at that time those individual nec- tars cannot identify themselves [saying], &ldquo;I am the nectar from this tree or that flower,&rdquo; so, upon reabsorption within the Exis- tent (sat), all these created beings do not discern that they have so entered. (CHU 6.9.1-2)15
Commentary
IN THIS SECTION, Śrī Jiva concludes the description of the taṭastha- śakti of Paramātmā. Jīvas exist both in the material creation as well as in the spiritual world. Their consciousness, however, is differ- ent. Those in the material creation are under the influence of māyā and thus are not devoted to Bhagavan. They are ignorant of Bhaga- vān and consider themselves as independent of any superior real- ity. In contrast, the liberated jīvas in the spiritual world are in full awareness of Bhagavan and are whole-heartedly devoted to Him.
This is contrary to the Advaitavada theory, according to which the jiva in the liberated state ceases to exist as an individual being, distinct from any other jiva or from Brahman. In Advaitavada, the jiva, or individuated being, is thought to exist only in the conditioned state.

Ilsbad 47 Two Types of Jīvas ol
Although the jiva is never in fact born, it comes into existence in the material world because of its being conditioned by māyā. Birth, therefore, is only of its upadhi, the psycho-somatic organism. Because of its identification with the body, the jiva thinks of the body&rsquo;s genesis as its own birth.
bib In their prayers to Paramātmā, the Śrutis state that during the dissolution, the jivas are in a dormant state, merged within Param- ātmā. They do not have physical bodies at that time and thus they can neither perceive nor experience anything external. When it is time for the next cycle of creation, the gunas of prakṛti are thrown into disequilibrium, and the dispositions (vāsanās) of the jivas are thus revived. This process is described in an allegorical manner: Paramātmā impregnates prakṛti by injecting her with the jivas. The jivas are compared to semen and prakṛti to a woman&rsquo;s womb. When a man unites with a woman, he also injects the jivas contained in his semen into her womb. 10 bod snoothie (2014)
When it is time for dissolution, all jīvas merge back into Param- ātmā, devoid of all names or forms. This does not mean, however, that they become one with Him and thereby lose their individual existence. The Śrutis offer two examples to illustrate this occur- rence: that of rivers merging into the ocean and that of pollen brought by honeybees from various flowers to make honey. Once the rivers enter the ocean, they lose their respective names and forms, but this does not mean that the rivers themselves are lost. We are not able to distinguish between the water of the river and that of the ocean, but both exist separately, simultaneously. Simi- larly, although honey appears to be a uniform substance, in reality it is composed of parts from various types of flowers.ol even vedt Bot These examples should not be misunderstood to mean that the jiva and Brahman are one without any differentiation. If such were the case, then the jivas would not be able to take birth again in the next cycle of creation. When the jivas merge into Paramātmā, they lose their material identities. The examples of rivers merg- ing into the ocean and pollen into honey are to convey only this aspect of the analogy. The jivas enter into Paramātmā, losing their names and forms. They remain individual beings, however, along

with their daiva (translated as &ldquo;destiny&rdquo; in SB 3.26.19 above), or karmic inheritance. This daiva is the cause behind the creation. Paramātmā brings forth the universe to mete out the results of the jivas&rsquo; past karma, which was accumulated in the previous cycle of
creation.
ritid nwo at an alasnog aybod adiŚrī Jiva cites various relevant statements from the Upanisadic texts to show the distinction between the jiva and Paramātmā even at the transcendental level. In the citation from Chandogya Upani- şad (6.3.2), the word jivena is used in the instrumental case, which implies that Paramātmā enters the three devatās along with the jiva. This is self-evident, as both the jiva and the ātmā (i.e., Param- ātmā) are mentioned separately in the verse. The instrumental case (in the word jivena) conveys the idea that the jiva is secondary to Paramātmā and accompanies Him.&rdquo; The three devatās, under- stood from the previous section, are earth (anna), water (ap), and fire (tejas), which constitute the bodies of all beings.ad otni nomee
17
The quote from Svetäśvatara Upanisad (4.5) clearly states that there are two types of ajas, or rams, to be understood as the jiva and Paramātmā. The verse from Mundaka Upanisad (3.2.8) says that a wise person, becoming free of material name and form, attains the self-effulgent Purușa. It does not say that he merges into or becomes one with Him. 308REY HIS
The last quote, taken from Chandogya Upanisad (6.9.1-2), says that (at the time of dissolution) after reabsorption into the Sup- reme Existent (sat), the jivas are unable to discern that they have so entered. Their cognitive awareness being dormant at that time, they are in ignorance about their state, but this does not mean that they have lost their individuality.s
The example is given of honey in which the pollen extracted from different flowers is indistinguishable. Indistinguishability should not be equated with the loss of individuality.

one from the other, but it does not mean that the papaya seeds have become black pepper.
This concludes the description of the jiva, the intermediary potency. The basic points discussed are as follows:</li>
<li>The jiva is the knower of the field of the psychosomatic organism
and is thus called kṣetrajña.</li>
<li>Paramātmā is also a kṣetrajña, but He is the knower of the field
of all bodies.</li>
<li>Paramātmā is the primary kṣetrajña, because He does not
depend on anyone else.</li>
<li>The jiva is an integrated part of Paramatma&rsquo;s intermediary
potency.</li>
<li>The jiva is ever distinct from Paramātmā, both in its conditioned
as well as liberated states.</li>
<li>The Advaitavāda view that Brahman alone is real and that the jivas are merely a product of Brahman&rsquo;s conditioning by māyā is not supported by scripture.</li>
<li>The jiva is atomic in dimension, eternal, conscious, the ref- erent of the pronoun &ldquo;I,&rdquo; endowed with agency, knower- ship, and experiential capacity, imperishable and free of all modifications.</li>
<li>There is a distinct jiva in each body.</li>
<li>In the state of dissolution, the conditioned jīvas remain within the body of Paramātmā along with their karmic inheritance, daiva.</li>
<li>There are two types of jivas, those eternally liberated and devoted to Bhagavan (nitya-mukta), and those in the beginning- less state of bondage to phenomenal existence (nitya-baddha). 11. The nitya-baddha jivas can become liberated by surrendering to
Bhagavan.
In the next section, Śrī Jīva Prabhu begins a new topic to delineate the nature of the extrinsic potency, bahiranga-sakti.

own intrinsic nature. This potency, called māyā, which is oper- ative in the matter of cosmic creation [maintenance and disso- lution], was referred to earlier in terms of its incidental charac- teristics (taṭastha-lakṣaṇa). It is known as tri-varṇā, or tricol- ored, signifying that which is constituted of the three gunas, as depicted by the followers of the Atharva: &ldquo;The potency of Bha- gavan, which fulfills all desires, is white, black, and red.&ldquo;2 That it is made up of the gunas is also stated in the Gītā, &ldquo;This divine māyā of Mine consisting of the gunas is very difficult to cross&rdquo; (GĪTĀ 7.14).3

IN THIS SECTION, Śrī Jiva begins a new topic, the description of the bahiranga-sakti, or the extrinsic potency. This account continues till Anuccheda 55. Paramātmā presides over both the taṭastha and bahiranga-śaktis. Having defined the incidental and intrinsic char- acteristics of the taṭastha-sakti, Śrī Jīva now begins his explanation of the extrinsic energy, or bahiranga-sakti, which is the taṭastha- śakti&rsquo;s field of action (kṣetra). This is called prasanga-sangati, or contextual correlation. The antaranga-sakti, which manifests the transcendental abode, associates, and divine play of Bhagavan, was already explained in Bhagavat Sandarbha (Anucchedas 13 ff.).
The bahiranga potency is known by different names, such as prakṛti, māyā, and Durga. The incidental characteristics (taṭastha- lakṣaṇa) of the bahiranga-sakti refer to its role in the matter of cos- mic creation, sustenance, and dissolution. Although these func- tions are ultimately conducted by Paramātmā, who manifests as the three guṇāvatāras, they are executed in a secondary sense by the bahiranga-sakti consisting of the three gunas.

THIS MAYA also has two parts. In four verses Bhagavan describes the mutual difference between the instrumental part (nimitta- amśa), called māyā, in the form of the gunas, and the constituent part (upādāna-aṁśa), called pradhana, in the form of primordial

That [Reality] which is here referred to [by Śrīdhara in his com- mentary] as Brahman is the same [Truth] referred to as Bhaga- vän in the verse of the Third Canto, &ldquo;Prior to the world appear- ance, there was only the all-pervading Complete Person (Bhaga- vän), the Self of all selves&rdquo; (SB 3.5.23). In both places, the object of exposition is verily the same one Reality, as stated in the verse: &ldquo;Those who have realized Absolute Reality, which is nondual consciousness (advaya-jñāna), refer to It as Brahman, Param- ātmā, and Bhagavan&rdquo; (SB 1.2.11). This will be made quite evident at the end of this chapter [SB 11.24], where that Reality is clearly [described] as existing in the form of Bhagavan, with the words &ldquo;[has been explained] by Me, who am the witness of the &lsquo;such- ness&rsquo; of cause and effect [or of consciousness and phenomena]&rdquo; (paravara-dṛśa maya): &ldquo;Thus, the process of Sänkhya, which cuts all the knots of doubt, has been explained through positive and negative inferential insight by Me [Bhagavan], who am the witness of the &lsquo;suchness&rsquo; of cause and effect [or of consciousness and phenomena]&rdquo; (SB 11.24.29).5

That one great (bṛhat) undivided and singular Truth, which is beyond speech and mind, was divided into two in the form of Its mayä [the perceptible world] and Its result [Its individuated expansions, the jivas]. (SB 11.24.3)

eved odw Svāmi comments: &ldquo;In order that the Great (brhat) Brahman could become accessible to speech and the mind, It became divided into two forms, as māyā and as Its individuated expan- sion (vilāsa), where maya means &lsquo;what is perceptible&rsquo; (drsya) and the result (phala) means &lsquo;Its manifestation&rsquo; (prakāśa).&rdquo;

This means that the object that is perceptible to Brahman is His māyā, whereas that which is a specific, or individuated, manifestation of Brahman (prakāśa-viśeşa) is the result (phala).

Svāmī also com- ments on this statement: &ldquo;From the intrinsic nature of Visņu, who is transcendental (parataḥ), i.e., devoid of any condition- ing (nirupadheḥ), [appeared] these two other forms, pradhāna and puruşa, which were described earlier.

THE EXTRINSIC ENERGY, called māyā, has two divisions, namely, nimitta and upādāna. The three gunas are the nimitta, or instru- mental cause, and pradhana, which transforms as matter, is the upādāna, or the constituent cause.

III The Ontology of Maya - Bahiranga-sakti
material world undergoes cycles of creation and dissolution, like day and night. During the creation, jivas perform actions and suf- fer or enjoy the outcome of their meritorious and unmeritorious deeds. At the time of dissolution, the evolutes of prakṛti merge back into their respective causes and ultimately back into prakṛti, which remains in an inactive state. During this period, the jivas have no physical bodies and their residual karma, called destiny or daiva, remains with them. This daiva is instrumental in bringing forth corresponding new bodies in the next cycle of creation.
Verse SB 11.24.2 describes that when the jivas along with their destiny and prakṛti are in the dormant state within Paramātmā, there are no divisions of seer and seen. This state is described in the Upanisads by statements such as, &ldquo;In the beginning, there was only the ātmā&rdquo; (BAU 1.4.1) 10 The word ātmā here refers to Paramātmā.
The Bhagavatam verse 3.5.23, &ldquo;Prior to the world appearance, there was only the all-pervading Complete Person (Bhagavan), the Self of all selves,&rdquo; cited in the present as well as in the previ- ous anuccheda, refers to the period of cosmic dissolution. Because prakṛti and the purusas are all merged in Paramātmā at that time, it is said that He alone existed. His &ldquo;aloneness&rdquo; is only in reference to the material creation, which is non-manifest at that time. From the point of view of the eternally self-manifest spiritual domain, however, He is never alone. He is accompanied by all His eternal
associates.
In this verse (SB 11.24.2), it is said that prakṛti and puruşa were one, not only during the period of dissolution, but in Satyayuga as well. How is that? It was so because in that yuga, people were fully endowed with wisdom, and thus they envisioned only Brah- man without any variety, as is proclaimed in the Mundaka Upani- sad (2.2.11), &ldquo;This world is Brahman alone.&rdquo;&rdquo; People in Satyayuga are situated in sattva-guna and thus perceive no variety, as Kṛṣṇa says in GĪTĀ 18.20, &ldquo;The knowledge by which one sees one imperish- able and indivisible Reality in all the diverse species of life, know that knowledge to be sättvika.&rdquo;

49-52 Two Divisions of the Bahiranga-sakti
In verse SB 11.24.3, the word maya refers to the world appear- ance from prakṛti, and phala (&ldquo;fruit,&rdquo; &ldquo;result&rdquo;) refers to the jiva. The jiva is called phala, or the result, because it is the jiva that suffers or enjoys the results of its actions. Prakṛti itself is inert and thus inca- pable of suffering or enjoying. The word phala can also be under- stood to mean &ldquo;aim,&rdquo; &ldquo;object,&rdquo; or &ldquo;purpose,&rdquo; which would indicate that the purpose of the extrinsic energy is to unfold the individual self&rsquo;s karma, as stated in the Bhagavatam (10.87.2).
Both prakṛti and puruşa manifest from Brahman or Paramātmā. This is made explicit in the next verse (SB 11.24.4). Here prakṛti refers to the upādāna, or constituent, part of māyā. Although the puruşa is not part of māyā, the residual karma or destiny (daiva) of the puruşa is maya&rsquo;s nimitta, or instrumental, part. It is to show these two divisions of maya that Śrī Jiva has cited these four verses from the Eleventh Canto. The verse from Vişnu Purāna makes the same point even more explicit. Here again, prakṛti refers to the upādāna part of māyā, and the purusa&rsquo;s conditioned state implies its nimitta part. In the following anuccheda, Śrī Jiva cites additional pramāņas about the two divisions of māyā.

All this is [called] &rsquo;the flow,&rsquo; pravaha. I worship (prapadye) You (Visņu), who are the ultimate or final prohibitor of all this [māyā].&rdquo; Here ends Śrīdhara&rsquo;s comment.

But the jiva, who possesses all these properties (tad-vān), is made up of both. A part of the instrumental potency (nimitta- śakti) also proceeds correspondingly into the set of constituent ingredients (upādāna), such as the &ldquo;I&rdquo;-consciousness (aham- bhava) of the jiva entering into the element called aham, which characterizes the limitation (upadhi) of the jiva.

which the third case is used, refers to the particular psychi- cal, or cognitive, instrument (adhyatma). These points are con- cluded from the context, as has been done expressly in Śrīdhara Svāmi&rsquo;s commentaries on this section.

Karma [in verse SB 10.63.26] is compared to a seed only to point out its causality. In this way, here also primordial matter (pradhana), which is referred to by the word kṣetra (&ldquo;the presen- tational field&rdquo;) and which is the root of the entire constituent (upādāna) part [of maya], is understood to be only a part of the original māyā. [When Śrīdhara Svāmi says,] &ldquo;the jiva is that which possesses all these properties&rdquo; (tad-van), he is indicating that the pure jiva is beyond mäyä.
Commentary
THE PRESENT VERSE is spoken by Jvara, the personification of fever. This may sound strange to the modern mind, but not so to that of the traditional dharmic culture of India. According to Vedic scrip- tures, even insentient objects, such as mountains and rivers, have personal conscious traits underlying their visible features. This needs to be researched by modern science. The eminent scientist James Lovelock created something of a stir in the scientific com- munity in the 70&rsquo;s of the last century by proposing the Gaia theory, which holds that the Earth itself is a sentient being. But it was not a surprise to those of the traditional Indian mindset.
In a similar vein, many common diseases also have personali- ties representing them. In Ayurveda, there are three ways to treat a disease, one of which is called daiva-vyapäśraya, or cosmic heal- ing. This includes appeasing the deity of the particular disease by

Bali was the grandson of Prahlada, the famous devotee of Nrsimha, whose story is told in Canto 7. His eldest son, Bāņāsura, was a great devotee of Lord Siva, whose capital was at Sonitapura. Bāṇa had a young daughter, named Uṣā. One day Uṣā saw a hand- some man in her dream and fell in love with him. When she woke up and could not find her beloved anywhere, she called out, &ldquo;Where are you, my darling?&rdquo;
Her friend, Citralekha, heard her and inquired into the cause. Uşă then told her about her unusual dream and that she was dis- tressed due to separation from her lover. Citralekha consoled her by saying that she would unite the lovers. She made portraits of all the famous contemporary princes, examining which, Uṣā was delighted to recognize her lover as Aniruddha, a grandson of Bhagavan Śrī Kṛṣṇa.
AloUsing her metanormal yogic powers, Citralekha kidnapped the sleeping Aniruddha from his bed in Dvārakā, Kṛṣṇa&rsquo;s capital city. Uṣā was overjoyed to be united with him, and Aniruddha also enjoyed her company for many days, all the while concealed within the princess&rsquo;s private quarters.

The eunuchs guarding the princess were eventually able to deduce Usa&rsquo;s loss of virginity when they saw telltale signs on her body, which they reported to the king. Bāņa was enraged to hear that his daughter&rsquo;s sanctity had been breached and immediately rushed there to punish the intruder. There he engaged Aniruddha in a fierce duel, eventually taking him prisoner.
When Śrī Kṛṣṇa heard of his grandson&rsquo;s plight from the celes- tial sage Narada, He was obliged to take up hostilities against Bāṇa&rsquo;s kingdom. This eventually led to a great battle between Kṛṣṇa and Lord Siva, who had come to support his devotee Bāņa. During the course of the battle, Lord Siva released his weapon, jvara, or &ldquo;fever personified,&rdquo; on Kṛṣṇa. Bhagavan Kṛṣṇa counteracted by releas- ing His own fever weapon, called Nārāyaṇa-jvara, which easily sub- dued Śiva-jvara. The latter then offered prayers to Śrī Kṛṣṇa, from which the verse under discussion has been taken.des-

53 The Upādāna and Nimitta Divisions of Māyā
The instrumental (nimitta) and constituent (upädāna) compo- nents of maya are being specified in the verse. Time is that which unsettles the equilibrium of prakṛti. Karma refers to meritorious and unmeritorious deeds, and daiva (or destiny) is the outcome of these actions. Svabhava (or innate disposition) is the unmani- fest state of daiva. Together these four constitute the instrumental (nimitta) part of prakṛti. The rest of the items, i.e., dravya, kṣetra, prāṇa, ātmā, and vikara comprise its constituent (upādāna) part. Here the word prāna (&ldquo;vital force&rdquo;) has been taken by Śrīdhara to refer to sutra, or the first modification of prakrti endowed with active potency. Sūtra is usually subsumed within the mahat-tattva, the cognitive potency, which is commonly accepted as the first modification of prakṛti (cf. SB 11.24.6).
The jiva, or conditioned self, is here said to include both nimitta and upādāna, because it is delimited by both gross and subtle bod- ies. The nimitta part in the form of daiva, karma, and svabhāva is located within the subtle body, which is a product of the upādāna part of māyā. Kāla influences both the subtle and gross bodies.com
Śrī Jiva comments that nimitta also pervades the upādāna cause. There is a subtle element called aham-tattva, or ahankära, which is part of the upādāna cause, since it constitutes the subtle body. But the &ldquo;I&rdquo;-consciousness (aham-bhava) within this aham is a nimitta cause, being the agency behind all action. This &ldquo;I&rdquo;-consciousness is a product of the avidya potency of maya. This is stated in the verse cited from the Third Canto (SB 3.6.25). sdt at (atürdürlam) framele bat This verse forms part of a series describing the appearance of the Cosmic Body, which has three aspects, namely, adhyatma (the psychical, or cognitive, instrument of knowing or acting), adhi- daiva (the cosmic, or higher order facilitation of sensory or cogni- tive operations), and adhibhūta (the physical function, or object). Adhyatma refers to the ten senses and the mind, adhidaiva to the presiding deities of these senses, and adhibhūta to their objects. of The structure of all the verses in this series is similar with respect to the cases used for the three aspects mentioned above.

III The Ontology of Maya - Bahiranga-sakti
Śrīdhara Svāmi, while commenting on the first of them (SB 3.6.12), explains that each verse describes one of the Cosmic Person&rsquo;s senses. As an example, the following verse can be considered:me
The guardian of the world, Agni, entered the seat of the individ- uated mouth [of the Cosmic Person] along with a portion of his [Agni&rsquo;s] power of speech, by means of which the jiva is endowed with the sense of what is to be said. (SB 3.6.12)&rdquo;
The god whose name is mentioned in each verse (such as Agni here) and placed in the nominative case, is the adhidaiva, or the presiding deity of a particular sense faculty, who facilitates and governs its function. The bodily part named in each verse, e.g., the mouth, which is placed in the accusative case and modified by the word nirbhinna (&ldquo;individuated&rdquo; or &ldquo;separated&rdquo;), refers to the locus (adhiṣṭhāna) of that sense. The sense faculty itself, e.g., vācā (&ldquo;along with the power of speech&rdquo;), which is in the instrumental case, is the adhyatma (the psychical, or cognitive, instrument of knowing or acting). The task that is to be accomplished, e.g., vakta- vya, &ldquo;that which is to be spoken,&rdquo; i.e., the spoken word, is the adhi- bhūta (the physical function). In conclusion, the physical organ, such as the mouth, is the locus, the presiding deity of the sense faculty is the adhidaiva, the sense faculty that functions through the physical organ with the assistance of the presiding deity is the adhyatma, and the physical function related to a particular gross element (mahābhūta) is the adhibhūta.
lo According to this scheme, the word ātmānam (the individuated self) in SB 3.6.25 is the seat (adhiṣṭhāna) and has thus been under- stood as ahankära, or the material element of ego, that evolves out of the mahat-tattva. Abhimana (self-identity) is the presiding deity (adhidaiva), Rudra, who takes his seat in this aharkāra. Karmaṇā, which is in the instrumental case, is the psychical instrument (adhyatma), here referring to aham-vṛtti, or &ldquo;I&rdquo;-consciousness, which also has its seat in ahankära. Kartavya, &ldquo;that which is to be done,&rdquo; refers to the physical function (adhibhūta) that is meant

to be accomplished. The ahankära, which is a material element, is the upādāna-karaṇa (the constituent cause), and aham-vṛtti, which is the sense of doership predominated by one of the three gunas of māyā, is the nimitta-karana (the instrumental cause). The aham-vṛtti is within ahankara like an electric current in a wire.
Śrīdhara Svāmī recognizes karma as the seed of the body, because it is the cause of new ones, which are compared to the sprouting of karmic seeds. The body can be likened to fossilized karma as well as to the source of further karma, which leads to the next body.
Śrī Jiva Gosvāmi cited the prayer of Jvara to show the two divisions of māyā along with their corresponding subdivisions. The intention behind this is to convey the pure self&rsquo;s distinction from everything material, which includes the phenomenal &ldquo;I&rdquo;- consciousness. Next, Śrī Jīva describes the two divisions of the nimitta cause.

Both vidya and avidyă are forms of māyā, or the extrinsic energy. The compound mokṣa-bandha-kari is in the singular, but should have been dual, i.e., mokṣa-bandha- karyau, because it is being used as an adjective for the copulative compound (dvandva-samāsa), vidyāvidye.qmi na zem sviĮ ITČ and If bondage and liberation are produced (vinirmite) by māyā, as stated in the verse, then they could not be beginningless and end- less, respectively. To refute this, the verse says, ādye, i.e., that both are anadi or beginningless. This, however, creates a further problem. Bondage is beginningless but has an end, whereas lib- eration has a beginning but no end. So how can the word adya be applied to mokṣa, or liberation? To solve this, Śrīdhara Svāmī says that as long as Śrī Kṛṣṇa extends avidya for a particular living being, it remains in bondage, but as soon as He infuses it with the vidya potency, liberation begins. In other words, although libera- tion is the beginningless state of the pure self, bondage is the begin- ningless absence of awareness of that state. So, in fact, liberation amounts to the removal of this beginningless absence of awareness, an event which can be said to have a beginning.</td>

On the basis of this conventional knowledge, there arises iccha, or the will to enjoy or avoid sense objects. The will further impels one to take action (kriya), accord- ingly. These three-jñāna, iccha, and kriya — are instrumental in bringing about modifications in the upādāna, or primordial matter, meaning prakṛti (also called pradhana later in this section) and its evolutes, just as the sun&rsquo;s heat causes a tree&rsquo;s fruit to ripen.

Commentary
III The Ontology of Maya - Bahiranga-sakti
THE PREVIOUS ANUCCHEDA concluded with a verse in which the universe was described as the form of Bhagavan. This apparently implies that the universe is not made of prakṛti, or matter, for it was established in Bhagavat Sandarbha (Anuccheda 10) that the body of Bhagavan is beyond the three gunas. Śrī Jīva refutes any possibil- ity of identifying the universe with Krsna&rsquo;s form by citing verse SB 2.10.35, spoken by Śrī Suka.
hau ad bloodeti 9TH
In the previous two verses, Śrī Śuka refers to the gross and subtle phenomenal forms of Bhagavan, namely, Virat and Hiranya- garbha. They were described for the benefit of neophyte spiritual- ists to provide them with a basis for worship corresponding to their phenomenal view of existence. The intention behind the recom- mendation to worship such material forms is to channel energy and attention in the service of a &ldquo;tangible&rdquo; Divine, thereby diffusing the exploitative mentality and the penchant for violence toward living beings and nature. In the present verse, however, Śrī Suka says that the wise - meaning those who adhere to the path of pure devo- tion - do not adopt either of these two phenomenal forms as their ultimate object of worship (ista-deva). Rather, they worship only transcendental forms, such as Śrī Kṛṣṇa and Śrī Rāma. al ofW
Those endowed with discriminating wisdom do not regard the universe as suitable for worship, because it is material. It is not a manifestation of the intrinsic potency of Bhagavan. It is called a form of the Puruşa simply because the three gunas of prakṛti are presided over by His guṇāvatāras, and because He enters into the universe as the Immanent Self.
To prove this point, Śrī Jīva cites a verse from Märkandeya Purana spoken by Brahma to Durga. The verse says that Durga causes Visņu, Śiva, and Brahma to take forms. This sentence either means that Visņu, Śiva, and Brahma were formless before and then she made them accept these forms, or it could mean that they were already Visņu, Śiva, and Brahma and she made them take some other forms. If the first option is accepted, then the sentence does not make sense, because how could anyone designate them
360
57 The Universe Is Material
as Visņu, Śiva, and Brahma before they had taken form? More- over, such an option is not supported by any scripture. Visnu is an eternal being. This has been established in Bhagavat Sandarbha.
The second option also does not agree with the verse. The verse says that she made them take forms, not that she made them take these specific forms. Therefore, the bodies here refer to parts of the material world that are made of the three gunas presided over by the three deities. Durga is instrumental in creating these parts as she is the personification of māyā?

III The Ontology of Maya - Bahiranga-sakti
Because Brahman is a supramundane substance (paramālaukika- vastu), however, It&rsquo;s being self-endowed with inconceivable potency is certainly possible. Such potency is found even in objects such as the philosopher&rsquo;s stone (cintamani). Like a medicine that can mitigate afflictions arising from all the three dosas, or bodily humors, such an inconceivable potency sustains even mutually contradictory qualities, as a result of which it is accepted that Brahman is inclusive of parts even though it is also true that It is without parts.

There is scriptural evidence for this, such as in the Svetāśvatara Upanisad, &ldquo;The primordial Puruşa has extraordinary potencies; others do not have such potencies,&rdquo; and as in Srimad Bhagava- tam, &ldquo;Paramātmā, the Immanent Regulator (iśvara), has thou- sands of inconceivable potencies&rdquo; (SB 3.33.3), and in the Brahma- sutra, &ldquo;In the Supreme Self there are indeed such extraordinary

15331 Even if one argues that Brahman comes under the influence of ignorance because there is no other way of accounting for empir- ical duality (dvaitanyathānupapatti), we answer that one can- not imagine ignorance in Brahman, because that is clearly an impossibility.

authority, it is far from necessary to resolve the problem of the existence of duality [in the nondual Supreme Truth] by supposi- tion of &ldquo;no other possibility&rdquo; (anyathanupapatti) [than through the existence of ignorance or mayā in Brahman].
ततश्चाचिन्त्यशक्तिरेव द्वैतोपपत्तीकारणं पर्यवसीयते । तस्मान् निर्विकारादिस्वभावेन सतोऽपि परमात्मनोऽचिन्त्यशक्त्या विश्वाकारत्वादिना परिणामादिकं भवति चिन्ताम- ण्ययस्कान्तादीनां सर्वार्थप्रसवलोहचालनादिवत् । तदेतदङ्गीकृतं श्रीबादरायणेन “ श्रुते- स्तु शब्दमूलत्वात्” (ब्र० सू० २।१।२७) इति ।
So, it is to be concluded that Bhagavan&rsquo;s transrational power alone is the cause of the appearance of duality. Therefore, although Paramātmā by His very own intrinsic nature is alto- gether free from change or modification, He transforms into the form of the universe and so on through His transrational power, just as a philosopher&rsquo;s stone, or a cintamani gem, can produce anything desirable, and just as a magnet can move a piece of iron from afar. This has been accepted by Śrī Vyasadeva, &ldquo;Brahman is the creator because the Śruti says so; Brahman is understood only through the Vedas&rdquo; (vs 2.1.27).
opa
ततस्तस्य तादृशशक्तित्वात् प्राकृतवन् मायाशब्दस्येन्द्रजालविद्यावाचित्वमपि न युक्तं किन्तु मीयते विचित्रं निर्मीयतेऽनयेति विचित्रार्थकरशक्तिवाचित्वमेव । तस्मात् परमा- त्मपरिणाम एव शास्त्रसिद्धान्तः । तदेतच्च भगवत्सन्दर्भे विवृतमस्ति ।
Thus, because He has such potencies, it is not proper to define the word māyā in a material way to mean magical knowledge [as in the case of the apparently inconceivable actions of a magi- cian]. Rather, according to the etymological derivation from the root √mā, māyā is that [energy] by which wondrous varieties are produced, meaning that it is the potency that produces wonder- ful objects (vicitrartha). Therefore, the conclusion of the scrip- tures is [that the world is only] a transformation (pariņāma) of Paramātmā. This has also been discussed in Bhagavat Sandarbha (Anuccheda 39).

b The Ontology of Maya Bahiranga-saktia
Commentary her look
ilsub loan
IN THIS ANUCCHEDA, which has been divided into four sections, Śrī Jiva establishes that the empirical world is not imaginary as pro- posed by the Advaitavada School of Vedanta, but is a real creation of Paramātmā produced through His maya potency.
Śrī Jīva first refers to verse SB 2.10.35 cited in the previous anuccheda, where the phrase &ldquo;created by maya&rdquo; was used. He says that here the word maya does not mean &ldquo;ignorance,&rdquo; which is the definition especially current among the followers of Advaita- vāda. For Śrī Jīva, māyā is a specific energy of Paramātmā, because ignorance cannot create the universe.
In his commentary on Brahma-sutra (1.1.4), Śrī Śańkarācārya has used words such as mithya-jñāna, mithya-pratyaya, and mithya- buddhi for māyā, &ldquo;illusory (or false) knowledge,&rdquo; &ldquo;illusory percep- tion,&rdquo; and &ldquo;illusory awareness,&rdquo; all of which mean &ldquo;ignorance,&rdquo; ajñāna, which is a feature of maya. According to him, the world is not real but mithya, imagined within Brahman through ignorance. Brahman is the only reality in accordance with Śruti statements, such as, &ldquo;There is no multiplicity whatsoever in It [Brahman]&rdquo; (neha nänāsti kiñcana, BAU 4.4.19), and, &ldquo;All this is the Self&rdquo; (ātmai- vedam sarvam, CHU 7.25.2). For Sankara, it is only because of igno- rance (avidya, ajñāna, or mayā) that the one Brahman appears as Iśvara, the innumerable jivas, and the universe (jagat). To explain this, there are three major theories, namely:</li>

<li>Avaccheda-vada (the theory of limitation) of Vacaspati Miśra. to 3. Abhāsa-vāda (the theory of semblance) of Sureśvarācārya.
Padmapādācārya is the founder of the Vivarana School of Advai- tavāda. He wrote the Pañcapädikā commentary on the first four sutras of Sankara&rsquo;s Bhasya on Brahma-sutra, in which he propounds the theory of pratibimba-vāda. According to the latter view, just

<p>as the one sun is reflected in many pots of water, so the one Brah- man is reflected in avidya (i.e., rajas and tamas) as the jiva. Sim- ilarly, Brahman is reflected in māyā (i.e., sattva) as Iśvara. Sar- vajñātmā does not distinguish between māyā and avidya, stating, rather, that when Brahman is reflected in the totality of avidya- as causal nexus - It appears as Iśvara; and when reflected in the internal organ (antaḥ-karana) - a product of avidya- It appears as the jiva, or the individual self.qu si al byberAybiva odsto sri In his Bhamati commentary on Sankara&rsquo;s Bhāṣya, Vācaspati Miśra propounds avaccheda-vāda in contrast to pratibimba-vāda. He argues against the reflection theory, pointing out that reflec- tion is possible only of things that have color or form. He claims, rather, that the jiva is Brahman limited (avacchinna) by the antaḥ- karaṇa, just as the one indivisible space is limited by a pot, a room, and so on. The diversity of the internal organs (antah-karana) accounts for the diversity of the jivas. According to the Vivarana view, Brahman is both the locus and content of avidyā. Vācaspati Miśra argues, however, that avidya has Brahman as its object and the jiva as its support.) armis
According to ābhāsa-vāda, the jiva is neither a reflection nor a limitation of Brahman but a mere abhāsa, a semblance or appear- ance. Madhusudana Sarasvati calls this anirvacaniya, or inexpli- cable. Vidyaranya says that an abhasa is a reflection (pratibimba) that appears like the original object (bimba), but without having the original&rsquo;s characteristics? It is like the image of a face in a mirror - it resembles the original face but is devoid of its qualities. dis Sankarācārya has mentioned pratibimba-vāda in his commen- taries on Brahma-sutra (3.2.20 and 2.3.46). Brahman is the bimba,

the prototype or the original object, and the jivas are pratibimbas, or reflections. Padmapādācārya says that the prototype conscious- ness (bimba-caitanya) conjoined (upahita) to ignorance is Ïśvara, or God, whereas consciousness reflected in ignorance (ajñāna- pratibimbita-caitanya), which has been delimited (avacchinna) by the samskāras in the antah-karana, is the jiva. A jiva imagines the world through avidya, while personally being the support (āśraya) of that avidya. Avidya is the upadhi, or delimitor, of the jiva through the relation of asraya (i.e., through the jiva&rsquo;s being the abode or the support of nescience), and it is the upadhi of Iśvara through the rela- tion of visaya (i.e., through Iśvara&rsquo;s being the object of nescience). In other words, avidya influences the jiva, but not Iśvara. This will be explained in greater detail in the upcoming anucchedas.
This doctrine is also called drsti-srsti-vāda, the theory that the objects of experience are created at the moment when they are perceived. According to this theory, the world is prātibhāsika, i.e., imaginary or a mere appearance. By this explanation, Brahman remains free from the defect of modification observed in the uni- verse, even while being the phenomenal (upādāna) as well as the instrumental (nimitta) cause of the world. This view is also gaining acceptance in quantum physics:
(ud Sights, tactile experiences, odors - all these sensations are expe-as
rienced inside the mind alone. None are &ldquo;out there&rdquo; except by ail the convention of language. Everything we observe is the direct interaction of energy and mind.

Perhaps some readers will dismiss this as nonsense, arguing that there&rsquo;s no way the brain has the machinery actually to create phys- ical reality. But remember that dreams and schizophrenia (con- sider the movie A Beautiful Mind) prove the capacity of the mind to construct a spatio-temporal reality as real as the one you are experiencing now. As a medical doctor I can attest to the fact that the visions and sounds schizophrenic patients &ldquo;see&rdquo; and &ldquo;hear&rdquo; are just as real to them as this page or the chair on which you now sit. (Lanza, Berman 2010: 181-182)
Śri Jiva Gosvāmi refutes this Advaitavada view by saying that Brahman cannot be delimited by ajñāna either by being its support, shelter, or object, because Brahman is not related to anything else, It being the only Reality, as per Advaitavada. Moreover, Brahman has no qualities and thus can neither be the support nor the object of ignorance. It cannot be the cause of ignorance, being the self- luminous reality. If the world were imaginary and dependent on the observer alone, then why is it that a table is seen as a table by all? Why is it not perceived as a table, a chair, a cake, or a computer by different individuals? Why is it that one person sees it as a table, even while another person right next to him has his eyes closed? In other words, why do we perceive a common reality if there is no object &ldquo;out there?&rdquo; dets
The fact is that the Absolute has inconceivable potency by which It can perform supralogical feats. It can manifest the world through Its māyā potency and yet remain free of any modification in Its svarupa - as agreed by all the followers of Vedänta. This was discussed in great detail in Bhagavat Sandarbha. There is no need to envisage the world as imaginary to make Brahman immune to modification. Such a solution is worse than the problem itself.

There [in Bhagavat Sandarbha], it was also concluded that the absolutely untransformed Existent [Paramātmā] is trans- formed by His own inconceivable potency. By this it is to be understood that the transformation undergone by Paramātmā is not that of His essential being (svarūpa); rather, it is only that of His potency called dravya [i.e., elementary substance, or mat- ter] in the form of the evolutes (vyuha) emanating from but a semblance of His essential being, endowed with the quality of existence (sat) alone. The cintāmani gem also functions simi- larly. Therefore, because the universe is rooted in Paramātmā, the principle that He is its upādāna, or constituting cause, is not disproven. This is expressed by Bhagavan Śrī Kṛṣṇa in the Eleventh Canto:ashu

Therefore, the constituting, or phenomenal cause (upādāna) of the universe is sometimes called Brahman and sometimes pradhana. The modifiable potency (pariņāma-śakti), called māyā, is also described as being twofold - the instrumen- tal part (nimitta), known as māyā, and the phenomenal part [upādāna, i.e., the constituting ingredients], known as pradhana. The distinction [between the two] is that the one that consists of potency alone is instrumental (nimitta), whereas that composed of its emanations, or evolutes (vyuha), is phenomenal (upādāna). Therefore, it is also said in the Śruti that some portion of māyā is devoid of consciousness, as in the following statement, &ldquo;[He (Brahman) became] both conscious and devoid of consciousness&rdquo; (vijñānaṁ cāvijñānaṁ ca, TU 2.6.2).
अथ मूलप्रमाणे श्रीभागवतेऽपि तृतीयादौ मुख्य एव सृष्टिप्रस्तावे च ज्ञानवैराग्याङ्गत्वेन च पुराणान्तरगतिसामान्यसेवितः प्रधानपरिणाम एव स्फुटमुपलभ्यते ।
That pradhana undergoes modification (pariņāma) is also clearly evident in our principal authoritative text, Śrimad Bhagavatam. This topic is discussed in primary terms in the Third Canto and elsewhere in the context of evolutionary theory. It is also dis- cussed [in secondary terms] as an auxiliary (anga) to knowl- edge (jñāna) and detachment (vairagya), thereby supporting the reconciliation with other Purānas [in which such methods are advocated as the means of liberation].

In select places, in prayers, and so on, where even the theory of vivarta [i.e., the falsity of the world appearance] is discussed as an auxiliary to knowledge and detachment, the intent is not to show that the universe is redundant, false, or non-essential (anyatha-siddha) [i.e., something other than a real modifica- tion of pradhana]. Rather, their intent is to make evident that the notions of &ldquo;I&rdquo; and &ldquo;mine&rdquo; have been [falsely] superimposed, either on the pure Paramātmā, in regard to the universe as a

whole (samaşti), or upon His integrated part, the individual self (ātmā), in regard to its individuated body (vyaşți). The universe itself is real, however, having come into being as a result of the modification (pariņāma) of pradhana, which is an emanation (vyuha) from Paramātmā.
तत्र परमात्मनि विराडुपासनावाक्यादिश्रवणं हेतुरात्मनि तु तत्तदावेशो हेतुरिति विवेच- नीयम् ।
In this context, it is to be understood that in the case of Param- ātmā, the purpose [for pointing out such false superimposition] is to enable the worship of His cosmic feature as Virāt, as under- stood from scripture. Whereas, in the case of the self (ātmā), the purpose is ultimately to bring about absorption in individual identity as the pure self [distinct from the body and so on].
Commentary
Here and in Bhagavat Sandarbha (Anuccheda 39), it has been explained that Bhagavan has three types of potency, namely, intrinsic, extrinsic, and intermediary. We have also seen that the extrinsic potency is designated by many other terms, such as prakṛti, pradhāna, and māyā. It is this extrinsic potency alone that undergoes modification and manifests the universe. Yet, because all potencies (śaktis) are nondifferent from their potent source (śaktimän), known as Bhagavan, He is understood as the ultimate cause of the universe, the source condition that makes possible the arising of all causality (sarva-käraṇa-kāraṇa).
The extrinsic energy, called mäyä, has existence (san-mätra), but no awareness; nevertheless, although inert, it also has a pre- siding deity and therefore a conscious aspect. Thus, māyā has two aspects - one conscious, the other inert - but it is not imag- inary like the illusory magic of a magician. It is a real potency of Bhagavan. lsm of al instui ir nedenborg to nott be Sometimes the universe is described as a vivarta, an illusory superimposition, or projection, onto Brahman. According to

Advaitavada, Brahman is the only reality. It is self-luminous (sva- prakāśa), which means that It can never be the object of an act of knowing, yet It is immediately and directly intuited (avedyatve saty aparokṣa-vyavahāra-yogyatvam, Tattva-dipikā 1). Self-luminosity thus signifies Brahman&rsquo;s paradoxical capacity of making Itself immediately known in consciousness without in any way becom- ing an object of consciousness. It is never dependent on anything else for Its manifestation, but manifests all other phenomenal objects. Advaita Vedanta says that this consciousness is the same as the Self, for it is only the Self that is not an object of any knowl- edge and is yet immediate and ever present in consciousness. No one can truly doubt their own self-existence, because without self- existence such a doubt could never be posited in the first place. Rather, the Self, being self-luminous by nature, is the revealer of all objects of knowledge.
For the Advaitavādīs, the pure Self, or ātmā, (i.e., Brahman), is different from the jiva, or the empirical self. It is the empiri- cal self that passes through the diverse experiences of life and is bound by the law of karma. Moreover, Advaita Vedanta states that the universe has no reality of its own apart from the cognitions of the individual knowing subjects and discloses no truth other than Brahman (sarvam khalv idam brahma). All other events, mental or physical, are but transitory appearances. The world is a product of māyā, which has the two features of vikṣepa (the potency of project- ing the world appearance) and avarana (the potency of concealing the self&rsquo;s intrinsic identity). ildara

The word ajñāna, or ignorance, is also used in this doctrine for māyā. Ajñāna rests on Brahman. Brahman, also called cit, or caita-
nya
(i.e., consciousness), is of the nature of pure illumination, yet It is not opposed to ajñāna. Brahman becomes opposed to ajñāna and destroys it only when It is reflected through the mental modes, or vṛttis. Thus, ajñāna can be destroyed by caitanya only in the form of vṛttis, while in all other forms, ajñāna veils the caitanya from manifestation.
the According to Advaitavada, the one Brahman, cit, or caitanya, manifests in four ways by the influence of different upādhis.

Consciousness (caitanya) qualified by the antaḥ-karana, or the internal organ, is called pramatṛ-caitanya (subject-consciousness). When qualified by the antah-karana-vṛtti, or the mental mode that goes out to the object, it is called pramāṇa-caitanya (cognitive- consciousness). When consciousness is qualified by phenom- enal objects, such as a pot, it is called viṣaya-caitanya (object- consciousness), and when consciousness illuminates the object through removal of the veil of ignorance by the antaḥ-karana- vṛtti, or the mental mode, it is called phala-caitanya (percept- consciousness).2 Ajñāna, or ignorance, is the cause of all illusions. It is beginningless and has the status of positive existence (bhava) [i.e., not a mere absence (abhāva) of knowledge], yet it is removable by knowledge. hay

When the mind13 extends out to an external object through the senses and becomes transformed, so to speak, into its form, it is called a vṛtti, or a mode of the mind. As soon as this happens, igno- rance of that object is removed and the light of consciousness (caita- nya) reveals that which was formerly veiled. The appearance of the object is thus the self-shining of caitanya, or pure consciousness, through the vṛtti of a form resembling the object of knowledge. In spite of the caitanya underlying all this diversified objective world, which is but a transformation of ajñāna, that caitanya cannot mani- fest itself by itself. The nature of ajñāna is to veil its own creations. Thus, each object produced by the projective potency (vikṣepa) of ajñāna is covered by its veiling potency (avaraṇa).

In all this, although there is really no distinction of inner and outer, ajñāna creates such illusory distinctions as the individual conscious beings and the external world of time and space, etc., and then veils these forms. The universe is neither real nor unreal, but an illusory appearance out of the living beings&rsquo; ignorance. It exists for only as long as one is in ignorance of Brahman. Nevertheless, it is not completely unreal like the water in a mirage. It is compared to the appearance of a snake in a rope. A rope is real, but appears to be a snake in semi-darkness.
According to Advaitavada, this process of illusory perception may be explained as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, by the contact of the senses vitiated by some defect, such as darkness, a mental mode (vrtti) as &ldquo;thisness&rdquo; (idantă, i.e., there is something here, &ldquo;this,&rdquo; which is to be identified) is generated. 2. Then, in the &ldquo;this&rdquo; (i.e., the undiscriminated object) and in the mental mode that has taken the form of &ldquo;this,&rdquo; Brahman is
reflected.</li>
<li>Then the avidya associated with Brahman is incited by the defect, and this incitement along with the impression of a snake remembered through similarity of shape, etc., is transformed into the appearance of a snake. There is thus an objective illu- sory snake appearance, as well as a similar transformation of the mental mode generated by its contact with the illusory snake. 4. These two transformations, the mental mode in the shape of a snake and the external phenomenal illusory snake pre- sentation, are manifested by the perceiving consciousness (saksi-caitanya).
Thus, there are two phenomenal transformations, one in the avidya presentation forming the illusory objective snake phe- nomenon, and another in the mind. But in spite of there being two distinct phenomena, since their object is the same unknown &ldquo;this&rdquo; of the original perception, together we have one knowledge of the illusion. Thus, in this appearance of a snake, an indefinable (anirvacaniya) snake is generated by the defect in conjunction with the senses. The Brahman underlying the rope remains the same, but the avidya of the mind undergoes modification on account of
377
III The Ontology of Maya - Bahiranga-sakti
the doșa, or defect, and thus gives rise to the illusory snake. The appearance of a snake in the rope is called adhyāropa, or super- imposition. This is vivarta1 (illusion) from the point of view of Brahman, and pariņāma (modification) from the point of view of avidyā.
thu Śrī Jiva Gosvāmi explains that sometimes in the sections of the scriptures where the major topics under discussion are jñāna and vairagya, the universe is described as a vivarta of Brahman.15 He indicates that the purpose behind such descriptions is to create a sense of detachment in the minds of sadhakas on the jñāna-märga, as renunciation is the very basis for the path of knowledge. If one perceives the world as a mere appearance without fundamental reality, then such a person would lose interest in it.
Śrī Jiva Gosvāmi claims, however, that such descriptions do not intend to say that the universe is illusory or imaginary. Rather, their purpose is to show that the universe factually exists as a mod- ification of pradhana and thus has a role in the worship of Bhaga- vän. Its being a vivarta here means that it is an appearance or mani- festation of Paramatma&rsquo;s energy and not a mere appearance in the Advaitavada sense.
The illusion being pointed out in such passages is the superim- position (adhyāropa) of the notions of &ldquo;I&rdquo; and &ldquo;mine,&rdquo; in regard to the universe as a whole or the individual body, onto Paramātmā or the individual self, respectively. In the Bhagavatam, however, the cause and nature of this superimposition is different from the Advaitavādīs&rsquo; process described in the beginning of this commen- tary. For Jiva Gosvāmi, it refers to the true self&rsquo;s misidentification with the body out of ignorance.nedy ewitmstrada padal

the universe is anyatha-siddha, or without essential existence. The word anyatha-siddha is a technical term in regard to the theory of causality. It is used to signify &ldquo;apparent&rdquo; causal elements that are present prior to the production of an effect, yet in no way essen- tial to its production. Such elements are therefore understood as non-essential or &ldquo;dispensable antecedents&rdquo; to the production of an effect. A cause must exist prior to the production of an effect, such as vegetables for soup. Those elements that, although antecedently present, are not at all required for such a production, are called anyatha-siddha.
For example, a car may have been used to bring vegetables from the supermarket, yet the soup&rsquo;s production is in no way uncondi- tionally or invariably dependent upon it. So although the use of the car is antecedent to the soup&rsquo;s production, it could just as eas- ily be dispensed with. One could have used some other means to transport the vegetables, such as a motorcycle, a bicycle, or public transport. Thus, the word anyatha-siddha in reference to the world appearance would mean that it is without essentiality, or in other words, that it is illusory in nature. Jiva Gosvāmi explains, however, that the intent of scriptural passages that refer to the vivarta theory is not to demonstrate that the universe is unreal.

The real purpose behind the description of vivarta in the Bhāga- vatam and elsewhere in the scriptures is to enable consciousness to be fixed either on the Supreme Self or on the individual self, who is an integrated part of the Supreme. This requires transcending the false superimposition of the notions of &ldquo;I&rdquo; and &ldquo;mine,&rdquo; either upon Paramātmā or the ātmā, in regard to the macrocosmic or microcosmic forms of the universe, respectively. As anisoge
In the case of Paramātmā, the disclosure of the false superimpo- sition of such notions makes it possible for Paramātmā to be under- stood as the authentic &ldquo;I,&rdquo; or in other words, as the Self, of the uni- verse as a whole. This is relevant to the worship of His cosmic form as Virāt, as understood from scriptural statements. In the case of the ātmā, the unveiling of the false superimposition in regard to the body can lead ultimately to the direct intuition of the intrinsic &ldquo;I,&rdquo; distinguished from the &ldquo;my,&rdquo; resulting in absorption in one&rsquo;s
379III The Ontology of Mäyä - Bahiranga-sakti
true identity as the pure self, distinct from the body. This is possi- ble when it is recognized that what is illusory is not the universe or the individual body, but merely the false superimposition of the notions of &ldquo;I&rdquo; and &ldquo;mine&rdquo; onto Paramātmā or the ātmā in regard to these two phenomenal forms. nemele doua o

Only an object that exists elsewhere can be superimposed onto something else, for example, silver on an oyster shell.

Therefore, it is not the water that is illusory (mithya), nor is the mental modification (vṛtti) having the form of water and composed of memory illu- sory, nor is the mirage that resembles water illusory; rather, it

or opposite to that; who similarly takes the other, namely, the jiva itself, to be the root form of the Self, or in other words, as ultimate - as the Sankhya scholars do; for a person who holds to such a view, the jivātmā becomes an external object to be sought.

Commentary
As summarized in the previous anuccheda, the Advaitavada doc- trine holds that the world is not real but an illusory appearance (vivarta) of Brahman. The popular example is that of mistaking a rope for a snake in semi-darkness. The Advaitavadi proposes that the snake is neither real nor unreal. It is not real because when light is thrown on it, one sees the rope and not a snake. It is also not completely unreal like the horn of a hare because one actually does perceive a snake and becomes fearful, and may even jump back.
The snake is called the vivarta, or the illusory appearance, of the rope. It is also called an adhyāropa, or the superimposition of a mental pattern (vṛtti) or a memory trace (samskara) of a prior perception of a snake onto the indistinct perception of the rope. Sankarācārya defines adhyasa, which has the same meaning, in the introductory part of his commentary on Brahma-sutra (1.1.1). He says therein that it is the recollection and appearance of an object perceived earlier in another place or object (smṛti-rupaḥ paratra pūrva-dṛṣṭāvabhāsaḥ), who the (E/FSSES PIEPRAS
While commenting on this, Vacaspati Miśra writes that the phrase purva-dṛṣṭa (previously perceived) implies that something unreal is superimposed; it has merely been seen and does not have real existence. This is the significance of the word dṛṣṭa, mean- ing &ldquo;seen&rdquo; or &ldquo;experienced.&ldquo;23 According to Advaitavada, anything visible or perceivable by the senses is not ultimately real. Ulti- mate Reality is self-luminous and beyond the scope of the senses. It cannot be superimposed onto anything. Therefore, whatever

is perceived is anṛta, i.e., false or not ultimately real. This is the significance of the word dṛṣṭa.bou 11 leon ton at servinu odr 20By the example of mistaking a rope for a snake, the Advaitavādīs try to prove that the world is not real but a vivarta of Brahman. It is actually Brahman, but appears as the world out of the ignorance of the perceiver. It is for this reason that there are statements in the Upanisads, such as: sarvam khalv idam brahma (CHU 3.14.1), &ldquo;All this [perceivable world] is indeed Brahman,&rdquo; and, neha nänästi kiñcana (BAU 4.4.19), &ldquo;There is no variety whatsoever here [in the world].&rdquo;
Śrī Jiva Gosvāmi refutes this argument by stating that an imag- inary object cannot be superimposed. For superimposition to be possible, one must have a subconscious impression (saṁskāra) of a previously experienced factually existing object. The subcon- scious impression of the object is then superimposed onto a differ- ent object, which is also real but imperfectly perceived. If the orig- inal object were not real to begin with and experienced as such by the observer, no such samskära could be imprinted in the illusioned person&rsquo;s citta, the subconscious mind, wherein impressions of past experiences are stored.
Śrī Jiva explains the process of adhyāropa by the example of a mirage in the desert. Unless one has experienced real water, one cannot have the illusion of water in a mirage. If the world were not real and merely an appearance, vivarta, then we could not have any perception of it any more than of the son of a barren woman, and thus it would not be possible to superimpose it onto Brahman. 10 According to the Advaitavadi, the world is an outcome of adhya- ropa, but the world itself is also the cause or source of the adhya- ropa. To have adhyāropa, one must have an experience of the object (purva-dṛṣṭa, in the words of Sankara), but to have that experi- ence there must already be an existing object, which would be the outcome of another adhyāropa. This leads to the defect of mutual dependency or infinite regress.
To this, the Advaitavādī replies that it is indeed possible to superimpose an illusory object. For example, if one goes to a mag- ical show and sees a tree produced by a magician, which then disappears into the air, one will be able later to remember this tree

in a dream, even though it was not real in the first place. Similarly, the universe is not real. It undergoes an eternal cycle of creation and destruction without any beginning, and thus the saṁskāras from previous cycles are superimposed onto Brahman to give rise to the illusion of the present universe. Thus, vivarta continues.
Śrī Jiva refutes this by saying that there is no practical exam- ple of a beginningless succession of vivartas of an imaginary object. &ldquo;An example (dṛṣṭānta) is that about which both a common per- son and a person of highly refined discrimination hold the same view in regard to the object [illustrated].&ldquo;24 If there is no example commonly acceptable to both sides of an argument, the point being made by a proponent cannot be accepted.
Śrī Jiva argues that in any superimposition or projection (adhya- ropa), both objects must be real. The illusion is to mistake one for the other, such as the rope for a snake. In this example, both rope and snake are real objects existing separately in different locations or times, but the observer mistakenly takes the rope to be a snake. The illusion lies in not recognizing the rope as a rope, and not that either ropes or snakes are illusory.
In the example of a magician creating the illusion of a tree, the spectator has previously had the experience of a tree in real life. This mental impression is then superimposed onto the illusion the magician creates, which may be nothing but light or some other object. Without any real basis, one could not just see a tree in empty space. Rather, as in the case of a mirage, one mistakes the refracted sun rays from the earth&rsquo;s heated surface to be water. One could not have an illusion of water without the refracted rays.
Real snakes, which have been experienced by the person who mistakes the rope for a snake, do exist elsewhere. When one sees a rope in dim light, then because of their similarity and the inade- quacy of the lighting, the previous impression or memory of snakes in the past becomes activated and superimposed onto the rope, or rather, onto the indistinct perception of the rope.

Moreover, superimposition onto an object is possible only if one perceives that object in a general rather than a specific manner. For example, in the illusion &ldquo;this is a snake,&rdquo; the rope is known or perceived only in the form of &ldquo;this,&rdquo; a long slender and curvi- linear shaped thing, but not with the precise and distinctive quali- ties of a rope. &ldquo;This&rdquo; is the subject, which is a pronoun. A pronoun is a general word and tells us nothing specific about the referent for which it is substituted. Brahman, however, is said to have no attributes, general or specific. It thus cannot be the basis of any superimposition.
Superimposition is possible when one perceives only certain general features of some object and fails to perceive its distinctive, individual character. As in the case of the snake and rope exam- ple, in semi-darkness one perceives the rope rather indistinctly as a long tortuous thing (i.e., as having a shape similar to that of a snake), but fails to discern in it those special features that charac- terize a rope as such. Brahman is beyond all perception, therefore it is not possible to mistake it for something else, such as the uni- verse. Superimposition is not possible on an object that is either not perceived at all or clearly perceived.
Furthermore, superimposition may be applied in either direc- tion. Just as one can mistake a rope for a snake, it is also possible to mistake a snake for a rope. Such bilateral superimposition, how- ever, never occurs in the case of Brahman and the universe. No one ever mistakes the universe to be Brahman.
Moreover, superimposition is possible only when there are two objects having separate existence, such as a snake and a rope, which a person is then unable to distinguish between. But if Brah- man is the only reality, sarvam khalv idam brahma, and nothing else exists apart from Brahman, which is furthermore devoid of any qualities or form, then what can be superimposed onto it? Super- imposition is possible in limited objects that have parts. Brahman is all-pervading and without any subdivisions, thus there is no possibility of superimposing anything upon it. Jones melani

III The Ontology of Maya - Bahiranga-sakti
Even the objects perceived in dreams are not false. Dream objects are also the result of memory impressions in the citta. To take them for the very objects that were seen or experienced in the waking state is the illusion. Therefore, in vivarta, both Paramātmā or ātmā and the universe are real. But to mistake the universe for Paramātmā is an illusion. With this, the pantheistic doctrine is refuted.
The universe is generated by Paramātmā, but only from His extrinsic energy, and thus it is not absolutely one with Him, but it is also not illusory like the horns of a rabbit. Paramātmā is real and possesses real energies, therefore His creation in the form of the universe is also real. He has no need to create an illusion like a magi- cian. Having the power to create a real universe, why would Param- ātmā bother to create an illusory one instead? Vaikuntha, how- ever, is a manifestation of Bhagavan&rsquo;s svarupa-sakti and is thus one with Him. This was discussed elaborately in Bhagavat Sandarbha (Anucchedas 61-77).
25 Śrī Jiva Gosvāmī explains that although Paramātmā creates the world, He remains untouched by it, meaning that He is unaffected by the universe&rsquo;s modifications. The ignorant, being unaware of this truth, mistake the universe itself to be Paramātmā. Others, like the Sankhya philosophers, who fail to recognize Paramātmā as the foundation of everything, consider the individual being, the ātmā,25 as the cause of creation. Consequently, they search for the ātmā in the body. In Brahma&rsquo;s statement (SB 10.14.27) this is referred to as external seeking (bahir mrgya). The reason for this is that living beings have no capacity to know Paramātmā by their own effort. Unless they take shelter of Bhagavan, they remain in ignorance or confusion. In such a state of bewilderment, individu- als are quick to defend their own misconceptions. It is only when their awareness is turned toward Bhagavan that they are freed from ignorance.

Moreover, pariņāma-väda can be assessed as the intended teach- ing of the Srimad Bhagavatam, because the vivarta philosophy is studied only in sections dealing with jñāna and is thus sec- ondary, whereas parināma is described in those that deal with Bhagavan Himself and is thus primary. This primacy is further strengthened by the &ldquo;pincer rule&rdquo; (sandamsa-nyaya) [i.e., the rule of combined applicability], as pariņāma-vada is described in both of these sections.

The adj
The description of the universe as a transformation of Param- ätma&rsquo;s extrinsic potency (pariņāma-vāda) fulfills the purpose of providing knowledge of the inconceivable opulence of Bhaga- vän. On the other hand, designating the universe as illusory, which amounts to labeling it as perishable, is intended solely to instill awareness [for those on the path of knowledge] that it is to be abandoned, for it lures attention away from Param- ātmā. The implication is not, however, to suggest that there is no such entity as the universe. Rather, the universe is described as illusory simply to inculcate knowledge of the essential iden- tity of the jiva and Paramātmā [distinct from the phenomenal nature of the universe], as confirmed by the Brahma-sutra, &ldquo;The objects of the waking state [i.e., the visible universe] are unlike those of the dream state because they are of a different nature&rdquo; (vs 2.2.29).26

When the equilibrium of the three gunas that constitute the māyā potency was displaced by the force of time, the tran-S scendent Bhagavan, who is beyond the senses (adhokṣaja) and endowed with His own intrinsic potency (viryavan), placed His seed (virya) [i.e., His conscious parts] into that māyā through the Purusa, who is His own self-expansion.
Thereafter, the mahat-tattva evolved from the unmanifested state of māyā, which had been impelled by time. Being of the nature of awareness, it dispels the darkness of ignorance even while manifesting the universe situated within itself [in seed form]. (SB 3.5.26-27)29

From the earlier statement in this discourse, &ldquo;Prior to creation, there was only Bhagavan&rdquo; (SB 3.5.23, Anucchedas 47, 50, 55), it is understood that the One [referred to here as] Adhokṣaja, &ldquo;He who is beyond the senses,&rdquo; is Bhagavan. He, through the medium or agency of the Puruşa, who is His very own self- expansion and the witness of prakṛti, placed His seed called the jiva in the unmanifest (avyakta) known as māyā, which consists of the three gunas. The compound kala-vṛttyä, &ldquo;by the force of time,&rdquo; means by mayä in its instrumental aspect (nimitta), which has the power of time as its functional capacity. As is said in the Śruti, &ldquo;I shall enter these three gods [earth, water, and fire, through My own self-expansion along with the jiva]&rdquo; (CHU 6.3.2, Anuccheda 46).30

by Srimad Bhagavata Purana, although it is accounted for in parts of the book related to the jñāna-marga. Whenever the topic of creation is described in the Bhagavatam, it is always said to be a transformation (pariņāma) of Paramätma&rsquo;s energy. For example, in Chapter 3.5, Vidura asks Maitreya various questions, one of them being about the creation of the universe by the Supreme Person (SB 3.5.5). Though there are numerous accounts of creation else- where in the Bhāgavatam, Śrī Jīva specifies this description as the primary one.
In response, Maitreya explains how pradhana manifests the universe through the influence of kala, or the time potency of the Supreme. There is no mention of vivarta in this description. The three verses cited here (SB 3.5.26, 3.5.27, 3.5.23) are all part of Śri Maitreya&rsquo;s reply. The same conclusion can also be seen from the words of Brahma to Narada in the Second Canto while responding
gnomin to the latter&rsquo;s queries about the creation:
A
Through the agency of time (kāla), presided over by the Purusa, the equilibrium of the guņas became unsettled; through innate dispo- sition (svabhava), sheltered in the Puruşa, came modification (pari- ṇāma); and from the [jivas&rsquo;] destiny (karma), supervised by the Puruşa, occurred the birth of the mahat-tattva. (SB 2.5.22)32

Svabhava is the subtle form of karma, called väsana. Time is the factor that effects changes in prakṛti. It first influences the gunas by destabilizing their equilibrium. The imbalanced state with a predominance of sattva is called mahat; when there is a predominance of rajas, it is called sutra, and with a predominance of tamas, it is called ahankära. When time comes into contact with prakṛti, it assumes the forms of its various divisions, such as days, months, and years, none of which existed before. When svabhava acts on prakṛti along with time, the various of modifications arise, beginning with mahat. When karma acts on these elements, the various bodies presided over by the jiva come into being. ottot-forlom

word pariņāma has been used in the above verse. There is no men- tion of vivarta here. Vivarta is mentioned only in sections where jñāna is being described. It is cited with the express intention of instilling in the spiritual aspirant a sense of detachment from the world, which is the whole basis of the jñāna-marga. Examples of such usage are as follows: Myd naloga se owt ja silt l oals as

The cycle of birth and death does not cease, because the living being remains engrossed in phenomenal objects, even though they do not really exist, just as dream objects, though not real, persist for the person immersed in the dream state through the conditioned oft workings of the mind.

The word adhyāsa (superimposition), so popular among Advai- tavādīs, has even been used in the Bhagatavam in such contexts:
Superimposing the characteristics of the vital force, the senses, and the mind onto the self, which is inherently free from the gunas, [the living being] sleeps, bound by the notions of &ldquo;I&rdquo; and &ldquo;mine,&rdquo; while contemplating petty sense objects and engaged in material deeds. (SB 4.29.25)3532
Moreover, there is also mention of pariņāma even in sections of the Bhāgavata Purana describing jñāna, as will be shown here in the next anuccheda. Because pariņāma is found in passages describing jñāna as well as bhakti, it must be recognized as the principle pro- pounded by the Bhāgavatam. This is called sandaṁsa-nyāya, &ldquo;the pincer effect,&rdquo; or in other words, the rule of combined applicability.

Pincers or tongs hold an object from both sides and thus possess a firm grip. Similarly, pariņāma-vada coheres in both the jñāna and bhakti portions of the Bhagavata Purana and therefore commands a comprehensive grip on the book, making it clear that this is the philosophy it propounds.
In the first two verses spoken by Maitreya to Vidura, time is described as a vṛtti, or a functional capacity, of māyā. It was also referred to as such in the prayers of Jvara, cited in Anuccheda 53. Time thus acts as an instrumental cause (nimitta) in the modifica- tion of maya&rsquo;s constituent aspect (upādāna). Time is also said to be the volitional act (cesta) of Bhagavan (SB 10.3.26), as discussed in Anuccheda 99.

The three principal commentators followed by Gauḍīya Vaisnavas interpret parävarāṇām (greater and lesser beings) differently: (1) as the devas headed by Brahma and other liberated beings (Śrīdhara); (2) as Bhagavan&rsquo;s own integrated parts (sviyamsa) and His differentiated parts (vibhinnäṁśa) (Jiva Gosvāmi); (3) or as the liberated beings and the conditioned beings (Viśvanatha Cakravarti Thakura).
Sūtra should be distinguished from mahat. Mahat is predominant in sattva and is thus jñāna-śakti, sutra is predominant in rajas and is thus a part of the kriya-sakti, whereas ahankara is predominant in tamas and is thus dravya-sakti.

las nwo att at heraldstes flimpared of stedil ols IN THE ELEVENTH CANTO, Śrī Kṛṣṇa instructs Uddhava on the paths of karma, sankhya, bhakti, and jñāna. After hearing His instructions on jñāna (SB 11.7.6-12), Uddhava submitted to Śrī Kṛṣṇa that the type of renunciation of sense pleasures recommended by Him is very difficult to practice, especially for people who are not devoted. Therefore, he asked for instructions so that he could easily attain such detachment (SB 11.7.14-18).
In response to this request, Bhagavan Kṛṣṇa recites the dia- logue between Dattatreya and King Yadu, which is an instruction on jñāna, beginning from SB 11.7.26 and ending with 11.9.31. The verses cited in this section are part of this dialogue. Here it is

III The Ontology of Maya - Bahiranga-sakti
clearly mentioned that Bhagavan generates the universe from pradhana, and therefore it cannot be imaginary. Bhagavan, the time-potency, and pradhana are all real and thus their product, the universe, is also real. He is both the upādāna (phenomenal) as well as the nimitta (instrumental) cause of the universe, like a spider and its web.
It is interesting to note that Dattatreya uses the word kevala twice and the word kaivalya a further time in these verses (SB 11.9. 18-19). Kaivalya is a popular word for liberation used in classical Yoga (Yoga-sutra 4.34) and vivarta-vada (cf. Brahma-sūtra, Śānkara- bhāṣya 4.1.19). According to Amara-kośa (1.5.6), the synonyms of kaivalya are mukti, nirvāņa, śreyas, nihśreyas, amṛta, mokṣa, and apavarga. Most of these words mean &ldquo;liberation&rdquo; or &ldquo;the ultimate welfare.&rdquo; Liberation is also of two types: absolute merging of the self in unqualified Brahman (i.e., impersonal) and total emanci- pation of the pure self in transcendental love with Bhagavan (i.e., personal).
and gaivil &amp; most two antrant
The word kaivalya in SB 11.9.18, however, is a designation for Bhagavan and has thus been rendered as &ldquo;the Supreme Transcen- dence,&rdquo; or &ldquo;He who is perfectly isolated from phenomenality, being established in His own self-existence.&rdquo; As kaivalya, Bhagavan is also &ldquo;liberation personified.&rdquo; The adjective kevala (only, alone, or isolated) is used here in the sense of being pure or free of any limita- tion or conditioning by matter or māyā. In other words, it indicates that which is exclusively transcendental or spiritual. In his Krama- sandarbha commentary, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī glosses the word kevala in SB 11.9.18, which qualifies self-illumination (anubhava) and bliss (ananda), as pure (suddha), or as belonging to the essential nature of the Absolute (svarupa-bhūta)
In the following section, Śrī Jīva will further elucidate how Paramātmā is both the nimitta as well as the upādāna cause of the universe.

THUS, it has been described that the conscious and unconscious overt substantives (sthula-vastu), beginning from the empirical self (adhyatmika-jiva) on down to the earth element, are born from Paramātmā, who is self-endowed with subtle potencies in the form of conscious and inert substances, namely the pure self and the unmanifest pradhana, respectively.

Thus, Paramātmā is accepted both as the efficient cause (nimi- tta) when alone by Himself (kevala) and as the constituent cause (upādāna) when qualified by His energies. Scriptural authori- ties accept both these forms of Paramātmā, as in Brahma-sutra: &ldquo;Brahman is also the material cause since this is in conformity to the proposition and illustration [found in the Upanisads]&rdquo; (vs 1.4.23). In this way, Paramātmā is forever pure [śuddha, i.e., untouched by the material nature].

Because potency cannot exist without a potent source, it is said to be nondifferent from that source. If we accept the sat-karya- vāda, whereby an effect is understood as being a part of the cause, because it is brought to light through the manifestation of its own innate disposition present as implicit potential within its cause, then the effect is not different from the cause, as estab- lished in Śruti texts like, &ldquo;The created clay object is different [from the clay] in name only; only the clay is real” (CHU 6.1.4) 2 But from this, it is also concluded that the cause is different from
the effect.

The phrase &ldquo;This universe is like Bhagavan&rdquo; (idam viśvam bhaga- vän iva) means that the universe is not different from Him (ananya). Therefore, the [conscious entity who is] distinct (itara) [from the inert universe], namely, the jiva who is des- ignated as the intermediary potency (taṭastha-śakti), is also like Him [i.e., &ldquo;not different from Him&rdquo;], as above. Therefore, the following Śrutis [are given as evidence]: &ldquo;All this is of one self with that&rdquo; (CHU 6.8.7), and, &ldquo;All this is indeed Brahman&rdquo; (CHU 3.14.1).5

Bhavatah could be taken either as the genitive singular or accusative plural. In either case, what is sought is the dative case in the singular to go with pradarśita, so it is glossed as bhavantam prati. Such use of the genitive in the place of the dative is not uncommon.
? It should be noted here that Śrī Jiva Gosvāmi has revised his interpretation of
the verse in his Krama-sandarbha, concluding that the explanation given here in Paramātma Sandarbha is not entirely satisfying (nätihṛdya). The commentary there translates as follows: &ldquo;The Śruti states, &lsquo;All this is indeed Brahman&rsquo; (CHU 3.14.1). Brahman is simply another form of Bhagavan. So how can bivo Bhagavan be like Brahman? In answer to this, [Narada speaks this verse to Vyasa]. The word hi means &lsquo;because,&rsquo; i.e., &lsquo;because this world is like Bhagavan.&rsquo; It should not, however, be taken as Bhagavan Himself, for He is other (itara) 20than the universe, having distinct characteristics (vilakṣana). How then is the
world like Bhagavan? And how is Bhagavan distinct from the world? In answer, he says, &lsquo;from whom, etc.&rsquo; Because the universe is an effect of Bhagavan, it is described as being His form only in some aspects. Because He is its cause, He is superior to it, as is said in Svetasvatara Upanisad (6.8), &lsquo;No one is seen to be His equal or superior.&rdquo;&rdquo;

Commentary) akvagdra
on arstisvihu sdi tadi ansom (ovl növ PARAMĀTMĀ IS A CONSCIOUS BEING intrinsically endowed with diverse potencies. He is the fountainhead of the material universe as well as the jivas within it. The universe undergoes states of manifestation and unmanifestation. In the unmanifest state, it remains in its subtle form as pradhana, or prakṛti, along with the jīvas, who are without their subtle or gross bodies. In the mani- fest state, pradhana undergoes an evolutionary process, beginning with mahat and ending with the earth element (prthivi), and so the jīvas acquire gross and subtle bodies. Thus, Paramātmā is endowed with subtle inert and conscious energies in the unmanifest state of the universe, and gross inert and conscious energies when the universe is manifest.
हा परमा
In this way, Paramātmā is both the nimitta as well as the upādāna cause of the processes of manifestation and unmanifes- tation. By Himself, He is the nimitta cause of the universe, and through His external potency He is the upādāna cause of the uni- verse. Because His potencies are nondifferent from Him, not being able to exist or function without His support, He is the upādāna cause. Because it is He who precipitates the extrinsic energy to manifest the universe, He is the nimitta cause.
Śrī Jiva refers to Brahma-sutra (prakṛtiś ca pratijñā-dṛṣṭāntānuro- dhāt, vs 1.4.23) in support of this conclusion. In this sūtra, the words pratijñā (proposition) and dṛṣṭānta (illustration) refer to the classical five-step syllogism of Indian logic. This syllogism has three other parts, namely hetu (cause), upanaya (application), and nigama (conclusion). While commenting on this sūtra in his Govinda-bhāṣya, Śrī Baladeva Vidyabhūṣaṇa refers to Chandogya Upanisad (6.1.3), the same text that Śrī Jiva refers to here in this

The pratijñā (proposition) in that description is that by knowing the one (Brahman), everything else becomes known. The example

given is, &ldquo;Just as by knowing a lump of clay one can understand the nature of all clay pots.&rdquo; The sutra says that Brahman is also the material cause, like clay for clay pots, otherwise it would not be possible to understand everything just by knowing Brahman, just as one would not know anything about a clay pot simply by knowing the potter, the nimitta cause. It is not possible to know a product simply by studying the nimitta cause. The example from the Chandogya Upanisad is meant to show that one can know the product only by knowing the upādāna cause. But such is not the case with Brahman, otherwise the statement of the Upanisad that by knowing Brahman everything becomes known would be wrong. orbaubong of bevon obe
The principle that the effect inheres in its cause and is thus non- different from its cause, is called sat-karya-vāda. This, however, does not mean that the effect is exactly the same as its cause. If this were so, then there would be no need to call them by differ- ent names, and no agent would be needed to produce the transfor- mation. All it means is that the effect exists as inherent potential within the cause. It is originally attributed to the Sankhya School of philosophy. In Sānkhya-kārikā, Īśvara Kṛṣṇa writes:

The effect is existent [in the cause] because what is non-existent cannot be produced, because an effect requires a corresponding 980 constituent cause, because all things are not produced from alloq ain causes, because a competent cause can bring forth only that effect

The Buddhists say, asataḥ saj jāyate, &ldquo;From the non-existent comes the existent object.&rdquo; This is not corroborated by anyone&rsquo;s experience. We can press oil from peanuts but not from sand, because there is oil in the former but not in the latter. sidl
The Advaita Vedantins say, sato mithya jayate, &ldquo;From the exis- tent comes the non-real (false).&rdquo; Advaita Vedanta accepts only Brahman as real, and the world as mithya or vivarta, unreal. If the effect has the same nature as the cause, kāraṇa-bhāva, then the world must be real because Brahman is real. This is the position supported by empirical experience.
The Naiyayikas say that the cause is destroyed to produce the effect (sato&rsquo;saj jāyate), just as the seed is destroyed to produce the sprout. The effect is produced afresh and did not exist before. Their principle is called arambha-väda. This is refuted by the reason- ing that if the effect did not pre-exist in the cause, then anything could be produced from any cause. But such is not the case (sarva- sambhavābhāvāt). We need a specific cause to produce a specific
effect.
An effect is the manifestation of certain characteristics lying dormant in the cause. In the case of the universe, it is a modifi- cation of māyā, or the extrinsic potency of Paramātmā. Because a potency is not absolutely different from the potent, the universe is nondifferent from Paramātmā. This is the purport of statements such as, &ldquo;Indeed, all this [visible universe] is Brahman&rdquo; (CHU 3.14.1). But the cause is different from the effect, since it may have more characteristics than those manifest in the effect. Thus, Paramātmā is not only identical with the universe, but also distinct from and greater than it.
The same is also applicable in the case of the jivas. They are not different from Paramātmā, yet Paramātmā is beyond them. Thus, the Bhāgavata Purana does not accept the pantheistic doctrine of God&rsquo;s being merely identical to all that exists (i.e., God as divine immanence only), but that of panentheism, or in other words God as present in all created things, and yet distinct from them (i.e., God as both divine immanence and divine transcendence).

Commentary
ONE OF THE MAJOR CHALLENGES faced by Vedanta schools that accept Paramātmā (i.e., Brahman) as both the nimitta and upādāna causes of the universe is to defend against the notion that He under- goes modification in the act of creation. As already stated, for any- thing to be an upādāna (material) cause, it must undergo some mod- ification (vikāra) to produce the effect. Otherwise, the cause and effect would be absolutely the same.
According to sat-karya-vāda, though the effect is accepted as being nondifferent from the cause, it is not exactly the same; oth- erwise it would not have a different name and function, as in the case of thread and cloth. Śrī Jiva, on the authority of the Bhagavata

Purāṇa, solves this riddle by showing that Paramātmā has incon- ceivable potency, by which a part of Him undergoes modification in the form of the universe without causing any change in His svarupa, or essential nature. Toss all al savo di bas yansdog allo
The verse from the Eleventh Canto is spoken by Bhagavan Hamsa to the Kumāra brothers. In it, Bhagavan indicates that He is the supreme cause, i.e., both nimitta as well as upādāna, of the universe. Therefore, the universe is not different from Him.
Jiva states as a general principle that although an effect is non- different from its upādāna cause, the upādāna cause is distinct from its effect. It is not necessary that the whole of the upādāna cause has to change to give rise to an effect. Thus, the importance of the word anyasmat, &ldquo;from one who is different,&rdquo; in the verse spoken by Brahmā. A said this clearly to Navade
।।
The same idea is expressed by Śrī Kṛṣṇa in the Gitā: &ldquo;All beings are in Me, but I am not situated in them&rdquo; (mat-sthani sarva-bhūtāni na caham teşv avasthitaḥ, GITA 9.4). Because Paramātmā is different from the universe, the defects of the universe do not reflect in Him. In the upcoming five sections (Anucchedas 62-66), Śrī Jiva will show how the universe is not different from Paramātmā.

THE FIVE VERSES that form the core of the following discussion were spoken by the sage Narada to King Yudhisthira at the con- clusion of his instructions on the principles of varnāśrama-dharma. In the preceding few verses, Śrī Narada described the two paths called pitṛ-yāna, also known as the path of engagement (pravṛtti), and deva-yāna, also known as the path of withdrawal (nivṛtti). One who knows these two paths in essence is not deluded even while liv- ing in this material body. The present verse supplies the reason for not being so deluded. When one recognizes everything as a mani- festation of Paramātmā, nothing remains that can delude. Delu- sion occurs because of the perception of duality or the feeling of independence from Paramātmā.
[id]
The supreme principle of Srimad Bhagavata Purana is that there is only one conscious, nondual, and independent, Absolute Real- ity. Nothing exists without the support of this Reality. Therefore, there is no vijātīya-bheda, or difference of class, between this Abso- lute and any object of this universe. There is nothing self-luminous besides Him.
कार
This denial of vijātīya-bheda is different from that posited by the proponents of vivarta-vada, for whom nothing other than Brah- man really exists, there being only the appearance of separate exis- tence. According to sat-karya-vāda, the objects of the world are not illusory. The cause is real and so too are the effects, which are fac- tual but not independent. The question naturally arises, &ldquo;If nothing is different from Paramātmā, then why do the objects of the world appear to be different?&rdquo; This will be answered in the next section.

Just as a reflection (abhasa) is envisaged as a real thing, despite its being completely disproved [logically], so also objects per-d brceived by the senses are only imagined to be independent real- ities (artha), because this would be impossible [to prove or demonstrate]. (SB 7.15.58)1

The word ā-badhita means that it is completely (a-) contra- dicted (badhita), because it is contrary to rational argument. In other words, the idea that anything has independent exis- tence has been disproven. So, even though this is the case, all objects of sensory awareness are imagined by the spiri- tually unaware to be diverse independent objects, just as an

appearance (ābhāsa), such as the individual rays emanating from the sun or some other source of light, is envisaged (smrta) by children [or those of undeveloped discrimination] as inde- pendent entities, because they are seen to give off their own light. But such perception does not arise from the vision of reality, because it is impossible to describe sensory objects as independent [of Paramātmā].

Commentary that form the core of the following discussion were spoken by the sage Narada to King Yudhisthira at the con ALTHOUGH everything is a manifestation of Paramātmā&rsquo;s potency and thus nondifferent from Him, out of ignorance all objects of per- ception appear to be different from Him. This is because the spiritu- ally unaware cannot perceive the presence of Paramātmā in them. In reality, nothing can exist independent of Paramātmā any more than a reflection of sunlight onto a wall can exist without the sun; indeed, it is not different from the sun. Only an ignorant person would consider a reflection to be independent of its source.
If we deliberate on the sense objects around us, it is easy enough to recognize that they are all ultimately produced from nature, being a combination of varying portions of earth, water, fire, and some gas. Nature, however, is not self-existent or self-born. Even if we hold that the universe is a product of the Big Bang, the question still remains, &ldquo;Who initiated the Big Bang?&rdquo; One is impelled to con- sider some sentient being as responsible for it. Thus, it is not unrea- sonable to posit Paramātmā as the originator of the cosmos, as Śrī Kṛṣṇa says, &ldquo;I am the origin and dissolution of the entire cosmos&rdquo; (GĪTĀ 7.6), and, &ldquo;One who perceives that Vasudeva is everything is a great being and extremely rare&rdquo; (GĪTĀ 7.19)3dbdapbour
Having stated in this verse that a reflection is logically disproved, Narada now proceeds to show how this is so.

If the first option were true [that the body pervades every part in its entirety], then even one finger alone could be taken as the [entire] body; if the second, then accepting that the body pervades every part only partially would lead to an endless process of partition [i.e., the fault of infinite regress]. There- fore, [it is concluded that] the existence of the body, etc., as an independent entity is false.
Commentary
ataviens no jains(do
IN THE PREVIOUS SECTION, Śrī Jiva Gosvāmī explained how the objects in the world are not independent of Paramātmā. Now he further explains that the sense objects as well as the body used to experience them are not independent of the material elements of which they are constituted. The verse cited here, in which the various positions of the Indian schools of philosophy with regard to the relation of a whole to its parts are indicated, is a contin- uation of the teachings of the sage Narada to King Yudhisthira. Among the Indian schools of philosophy there are different opin- ions about the relation between a whole and its parts, some of which are summarized in the following verse:
doidwives
to The Naiyayikas accept ārambha-vāda, which states that a whole is To different from its parts and exists within the parts. Buddhists and Carvākas hold to the sanghata-väda, that the whole is an aggregate of its parts and the parts are in the whole. Sänkhya (pariņāma- vada) says that the whole is not different from its parts, being merely a different state thereof. [Advaita] Vedanta says that both parts and the whole are illusory (vivarta-vāda)&rdquo;
What is the status of a material composite, i.e., of a body, in rela- tion to its constituents? Is it merely an aggregate of its parts, or is it something more than that? The Cārvākas and Buddhists consider

This verse from an unknown source is cited by Vamsidhara in his commentary reon the present verse.
415
III The Ontology of Maya - Bahiranga-śakti
it to be nothing more than the parts existing together (sanghata). The Sankhyaites as well as Mimāmsakas consider the whole to be one with its parts, since they hold that no new thing can be pro- duced. The Naiyayikas, however, take the opposite view. Accord- ing to them, the production of a sensible material order from infra- sensible atoms can only be explained on the basis of an assumption that the whole is different from its parts.
Nyaya texts cite and refute an epistemological theory of un- known origin which states that all direct perception of external objects, on analysis, are cases of inference. This theory holds that for something, such as a table, to be perceived by an external sense, it must possess perceptible magnitude (mahattva). This means that the object must be composed of parts, because an incomposite thing can have no sensible or measurable dimension. If a table is to be perceived, then all of its parts must be seen simultaneously. But it is impossible to see it in its entirety because our sense of sight can come in contact only with what is before us. Therefore, we may say that we see a table when in fact we see only the front of it and then infer the rest, which is imperceptible.
A gross physical object, such as a table, may be considered as either an aggregate of its parts (avayava-samuha) or a complex whole (avayavi), which, though composed of parts, is different from each and all of them (dravyantara). The first is the view of Cārvākas and Buddhists and the second that of the Naiyayikas. But neither of these alternatives fits the theory that the act of cognizing a thing is necessarily an act of inference.
do If we consider the first option, that the gross physical object, such as a table, has no existence separate from its parts, and since any part that is perceived cannot be inferred at the same time, the only possible object of inference is the part that is not perceived. The unperceived part of a thing thus turns out to be identical with the thing itself, which is indeed absurd. If the whole is equated with the totality of its parts, the notion of a full table cannot be generated merely in respect of any particular part of it. In other words, the unperceived part does not add anything extra to the cog- nition of the table, because one has the notion of the latter even
416
64 The Body Is Not an Independent Unit
without the unperceivable part. Rather, an object such as a table is accepted to be an aggregate of all of its parts, both perceived and unperceived. d other
Naiyayikas argue that even if it were possible to infer the unper- ceived parts, that would at best provide one with knowledge of another part side by side with the perceived one, but not of any- thing to which these parts might refer, that would consequently yield the notion of a table. Since neither of these two parts, per- ceived and unperceived, is itself a table, the knowledge of either or both of them is not knowledge of a table.
One also cannot say that the knowledge of a table arises from the synthesis of these two parts. Without a common ground, no such synthesis is possible. Synthesis implies the connecting of several perceptions with reference to one unitive principle. But no unitive principle is accepted by the Carvākas or Buddhists. The two parts of the table, according to them, are not really the parts of a unitive whole, but only discrete units constituting no more than an aggre- gate. It is natural that when two parts come to be cognized, they cannot be felt as complementary to one other. They appear sim- ply as unrelated items which are incapable of being synthesized or integrated in such a manner as to give rise to the idea of a table as a single composite unit.
There is, of course, the possibility of ideally combining, though not unifying, the perceived part with the unperceived part, but this would afford knowledge only of two isolated items mechanically grouped together, i.e., of the front and the back, and not of any- thing of which both front as well as back constitute inseparable and integral elements. Even if it is accepted that the idea of a table is brought about when the two parts (front and back) are cognized together, this cannot be said to be inferential knowledge. In infer- ence we obtain knowledge of a sadhya (that which is to be proven, i.e., the probandum) through knowledge of the hetu (the argument or reason, i.e., the probans). We do not combine these two kinds of knowledge to produce the knowledge of one unit. For inference to work, we must have knowledge of vyapti, i.e., of the invariable concomitance between the argument (probans) and the thing to be
417
III The Ontology of Maya - Bahiranga-sakti
proven (probandum). If the table, as an aggregate of its parts, is to be inferred from the perception of one of these parts, it is neces- sary that the aggregate should be believed to be true, and also that the aggregate should be known to have an invariable relation with the parts in question. But we can observe only a part and not the aggregate, which necessarily contains the unperceived part as well. If the aggregate itself is imperceptible, we cannot claim to have ever directly experienced its relation with any of its parts.
19 Moreover, the whole contention proceeds on the belief that there can be an inference of the unperceived part from the per- ceived one. But there is no proof for this. We cannot accept the proposition (pratijñā), &ldquo;The front necessarily possesses a back.&rdquo; How can one part possess another part? Only a whole (avayavi) can have parts. But the opponent does not accept a whole. He accepts only an aggregate that is identical with its parts. sivi In the case of the aggregate, we also cannot make the proposi- tion, &ldquo;Wherever there is a front, there is [also] a back part.&rdquo; It can- not be explained why two parts should come together. There is no causality between them. They are also not related as parts cooper- ating to produce a common effect, which would make them mem- bers of a single causal collocation (samagri) or the co-effects of a common causal factor. In the case of smoke and fire, smoke cannot be produced without fire. In the same way, the potter&rsquo;s apparatus and clay are invariably related as causes for a pot. Similarly, sweet- ness and whiteness in sugar have an invariable relation, because they have a common cause, the sugar. All these cases of &ldquo;being together as a matter of necessity&rdquo; (vyäpti) are governed by the law of causation, either directly or indirectly. But if a thing is a mere aggregate of discrete and independent parts, it cannot be regarded as produced by them. Thus, there is no compulsion for the parts to be held together.
To summarize, a whole cannot be equivalent to the mere aggre- gate of its parts, because the perception of it as a single unit is an uncontradicted fact. The theory that equates the whole with the totality of its parts serves only to show that the perception of the whole is impossible.

64 The Body Is Not an Independent Unit
This problem can be resolved, however, if a whole is accepted, because a whole must have both a front as well as a back. The Naiyayikas argue that the whole is directly perceived with the per- ception of one of its parts. If the whole were imperceptible, there could be no knowledge of it even by means of inference. No rela- tion between an imperceptible whole and a perceptible part can be observed, and in the absence of the knowledge of a relation, no inference is possible. Moreover, if the whole were imperceptible, the part also would become imperceptible, because a part is also a whole in relation to its parts. So denial of the perceptibility of the whole would ultimately reduce an object to a loose juxtaposition of imperceptible atoms. But such, indeed, is not our experience. Therefore, when we see a table, we not only see its front part or the part visible to our eyes, but also the table [as a whole].

Refutation of the Naiyayika View to aring yus even of besogare
If a whole is to be perceived in its entirety, as proposed by the Naiyāyika, then it must be perceived as existing in all its parts. This means that one must perceive all its parts simultaneously. But this is impossible. The whole could be perceived in its entirety if it were supposed to exist fully and thus be exhausted in the part that is per- ceived. This is, of course, absurd when we consider the relation of a whole to its parts.
Does the whole exist in a part completely or partially? If it exists completely in one part, then the other parts are superfluous, because they can be of no service to it. The whole is exhausted in one part and nothing is left of it to subsist in and be constituted by other parts. Moreover, the whole, being devoid of a plurality of parts, cannot be an object of perception. A necessary condition for the perception of an external object is that it must have a gross magnitude accruing from a plurality of parts, which is not the case if the whole is in one part. Further, such a whole would be an inde- structible entity, because a gross object is destroyed when its parts are disassembled. It is also inconceivable how the whole can be
419III The Ontology of Maya - Bahiranga-sakti
exhausted in a part since the two are obviously possessed of differ- ent magnitudes. And if the whole be supposed to exist in each of its parts in its entire extension, then there would be as many wholes as there are parts, which can only mean that only parts exist and not the whole.iablo
The second option, i.e., that the whole exists partially in its constituents, is also not feasible. If this is to be accepted, then it means that the whole exists in its constituent parts through the medium of a set of intrinsic, non-constituent parts. This implies that only parts exist in parts, and the relation of the whole to its parts remains unexplained.
This also leads to another puzzle: How is the whole related to its intrinsic, non-constituent parts? If the whole exists only partially in these parts, there arises the need of another set of new parts. The relation of these parts to the whole would again require another set of parts and so on, ad infinitum. The whole, therefore, cannot be supposed to have any parts other than those that constitute it.
The whole is supposed to exist in all its constituent parts. The question may then be raised, &ldquo;Does the whole exist in its differ- ent parts in the same manner or differently?&rdquo; It is obvious that a whole cannot exist simultaneously in different loci in the same manner. The existence of a finite object in one place precludes its existence in another place unless the manner of existence be differ- ent. Any deviation from this principle is inconceivable. However, if the nature of the whole is supposed to vary according to the vari- ation of its parts, the whole cannot be a self-identical unity under- lying all of them. In other words, there cannot be any whole and thus there is no question of perceiving it.
To summarize, if a whole exists, it must bear a definite relation to its parts. But every conceivable kind of relation is found to be logically untenable. Thus, whether we accept the whole as an aggre- gate of parts or as a separate unit, both are logically impossible. The whole, therefore, cannot be a real entity.

164 The Body Is Not an Independent Unit
The Sankhya and Mimāmsaka Views drabbu
Tlam
vanus
The followers of Sankhya and Mīmāmsā agree with the Naiyāyika that there is a whole. They do not, however, accept the notion that the whole is an altogether new unit, something fundamentally dif- ferent from its parts (cf. Sastra-dipikā of Parthasarathi). They argue that the relation between a part and the whole cannot subsist if they are accepted as two distinct units. Because a table is different from a chair, it cannot be part of the chair or vice versa. Hence, whatever is part of anything is not different from that thing. The thread is part of a cloth and not different from it.
aidbbug aidT This view of Sankhya and Mīmāmsā is also untenable. It is fraught with logical fallacies. &ldquo;Being a part&rdquo; has been used as a rea- son (hetu) to establish the nondifference between part and whole. But the very conception of a part implies a whole different from it. To be a part, a thing must be a part of a whole. It cannot be a part unless it is a constituent of a whole. The part is of the whole, and the whole is in the part. There can be no relation of part and whole in a single self-identical entity. The two terms signify two separate entities. Moreover, the part is the cause of the whole. If it were identical with the whole, then there could not be a cause and effect relation between the part and the whole.

The Buddhist View
ali moil stain nodt noitesup
According to the Sunyavādi Buddhists, there is no whole as a real object. According to them, things cannot be accepted as really exist- ing facts on the basis of our knowledge of them. Knowledge can be a proof of objective facts only if it is true. But no knowledge is true, for no knowledge is a faithful representation of its objects. Our cog- nition of a thing is different from what we find out about it when we analyze it with reason. A cloth, for example, is cognized as a whole composed of threads. But if we analyze it, we find nothing but threads apart from which there is no cloth. So the cloth is not real.
gobal evad tou
In this way, the Sunyavādi argues that the whole does not exist, because it is not perceived separately from its parts. Similarly, the
421
III The Ontology of Maya - Bahiranga-sakti
Sautrāntika Buddhists say that there is no whole as a unit, but only a conglomeration of atoms. The idea of a whole as a unit is an illu- sion produced by the functional identity (eka-karyopayogitva) of the atoms. What appears to be a pot is nothing but a vast num- ber of atoms participating in the common task of holding water. Such an illusion is not uncommon. We speak of one forest, though in reality a forest is nothing but a number of trees, each of which exists apart from others. The atoms, therefore, though many, are like the trees of a distant forest, falsely perceived as a single thing and collectively called by a common name.
This Buddhist view is also refuted by the Naiyayikas, who argue that no such false perception of a unit, such as a table, is possible. A table is not a mere conglomerate of atoms, like a forest is of trees. Atoms are intrinsically imperceptible, so it is meaningless to speak of the non-perception of their separateness - which is supposed to give rise to the illusion of a unit. The illusion of the non-perception of separateness would be possible only if the atoms were percepti- ble to begin with. Something imperceptible cannot be the object of a perceived illusion.
From this it is concluded that a unit, such as the gross physi- cal body, is neither an aggregate of its parts, nor a new object sep- arate from its parts, nor is it a unit identical with its parts. The question then arises: What is a unit, such as our physical body? The verse under discussion concludes that our representation of the object as a single unit must be false because it cannot be proven logically. Śrī Jiva Gosvāmi comments in this connection that it is not the body itself that is false, but the mental (or intellectualized) &ldquo;re-presentation&rdquo; (chaya) of it as existing as a singular unit inde- pendent of its causes (aikya-buddhy-alambana-rupa). Nobody can claim that the body is false. This would be like saying, &ldquo;I do not have a tongue in my mouth.&rdquo; Obviously such a statement is false, because no one can speak without a tongue. hemog
Next, Śrī Jiva shows that, like the body, even the elements do not have independent existence.

Then may it not be claimed that the constituent parts are inde- pendent of the whole? In answer, the verse says that if the whole cannot be delineated in the aforedescribed fashion [i.e., as inde- pendent], then ultimately the parts also could not be so delin- eated. This is because if knowledge of the whole cannot be ascer- tained by any means, then there is no proof of the existence of the parts characterized as atoms. This is said in the Fifth Canto: &ldquo;In the same way, that which is named &rsquo;earth&rsquo; is also not real because of its being dissolved into its cause, the atoms. And the atoms (paramāņus), by whose combination the earth has been produced, are cognitive constructs conceived through ignorance&rdquo; (SB 5.12.9).3

Several manuscripts including the Baharampur edition (1882) read paramatma-caitanya (&ldquo;the Paramatma consciousness&rdquo;) instead of paramātma-vastu (&ldquo;the Paramātmā substantive&rdquo; or &ldquo;the real existent, Paramātmā&rdquo;) in the four occasions that the word is found in Sections 65 and 66. It appears that this latter reading superseded the first, probably in a later sredaction by Śrī Jīva himself. This last use reflects the word vastu in the verse
(SB 7.15.61) quoted in Anuccheda 65 and is perhaps the reason for the subsequent redaction. The word vastu means &ldquo;a real entity or substance.&rdquo;

Therefore, the idea that everything is said to be the body of Paramätmä, whereas Paramātmā is the Self existent [in all bod- ies], is well known from Śruti statements, such as, &ldquo;He whose body is the earth&rdquo; (yasya pṛthivi sariram, BAU 3.7.3). In this way, it has been established that the component parts (avayava) are modifications of pradhana, whereas the whole (avayavi) everywhere is none other than the real existent, Paramātmā (paramätma-vastu). This also proves that the universe is indeed not false or imaginary (mithya).png

IT WAS EXPLAINED in the previous section that a whole, such as the body, does not exist as an independent unit. It cannot be delineated as an aggregate (sanghata), a compound (vikāra), or a modification. (pariņāma) of its parts. This is also true of the gross elements that are the basis for a whole, such as the body, because they are also wholes or units made of the tan-matras, or subtle elements.
The gross elements are not the basic building blocks of objects. If one proposes that since it is not possible to define a whole as an independently existing unit, then let us assume that the parts can exist independently. Śrī Jīva denies this proposition. If the whole cannot be defined properly, then how can the parts that constitute it be so defined?
According to the Nyaya-Vaiśeṣika School, the anu, or paramāņu, is the basic unit of matter. The word paramāņu is usually trans- lated as &ldquo;an atom,&rdquo; but it should be noted that it is defined as the indivisible or irreducible unit of matter. Therefore, it should not be taken to mean the atom of modern science, which is divisible. In fact, modern science is still inconclusive about the basic build- ing blocks of matter, whether it consists of waves or particles. Śrī Jiva here says that there is no proof that such paramāņus, or atoms, really exist without any support. This is clear from the teachings of Jada Bharata to King Rahugana.id vahahat major alte
Once King Rahugaṇa was traveling in a palanquin carried by four men to meet a holy sage who was living in the forest. On the

way, one of the carriers fell sick and so the king asked the others to look for someone to replace him. They found Jaḍa Bharata, a real- ized brāhmaṇa, who was wandering carefree in the forest in the guise of a madman. Seeing his stout and strong body, the carriers asked him to join them and he agreed without any hesitation.
While carrying the king, however, Jada Bharata was careful not to step on any ants and so did not walk in harmony with the other carriers. This caused the king discomfort by making jerky move- ments. Rahūgana chastised the carriers for their discordant walk. The carriers immediately pointed out that it was the new servant who was not able to keep up with them. The king spoke sarcasti- cally to Jada Bharata and finally threatened to punish him. At this point, Jada Bharata broke his silence and spoke words of wisdom that shocked the king, who had mistaken him for a dullard. The king jumped down from his palanquin and fell at the feet of Jada Bharata who then instructed him:
190
When we directly cognize that the world of animate and inanimate beings always appears from and is dissolved back into the earth, then please tell me, apart from the differing names [of the entirety of earthly by-products, which are ultimately identical with the earth], is there any other foundation for our worldly activities that can be concluded to be real, simply because it serves some practical purpose?
Upant
In the same way, that which is named &ldquo;earth&rdquo; is also not real wor because of its being dissolved into its cause, the atoms. And the
atoms (paramāņus), by whose combination the earth has been produced, are cognitive constructs conceived through ignorance. 1 (SB 5.12.8-9)how Innsmonsrig od to

Jada Bharata spoke these verses in response to the king&rsquo;s state- ments made in refutation of his earlier instructions. When Jaḍa Bharata was unable to keep pace with the co-carriers, the king had remarked sarcastically:

O brother, it is indeed painful. Clearly you look tired because you have travelled such a long distance bearing my weight single-l handedly for a long time. O friend, you are not hale and hearty, an and not of strong limb. You are troubled with old age and the other It carriers do not assist you [at all]. (SB 5.10.6)8
After hearing these words, Jada Bharata began to speak smil- ingly. He said:
O valiant King! What has been implied by you [through opposite indication, that I have not labored at all] is evidently true, and so dit does not involve criticism. Your words would have been a repri-dw aidmand if the burden of the bearer had belonged to me [the pure self,
and not to the body], and if the destination to be reached and the g path to be tread by the traveler [the body] were applicable to me. d sb To refer to me [the self] as stout is not the statement of the wise,
for stoutness relates only to the body. (SB 5.10.9)
To this the king replied that he himself becomes fatigued by per- forming his royal duties. This was his practical experience; there- fore, Bharata must also have felt tired by carrying the palanquin. One cannot deny the phenomenal world even if one is liberated. One cannot carry water in an imaginary pot. Therefore, one must accept the phenomenal world (SB 5.10.21).

The two verses cited here are Jada Bharata&rsquo;s response regard- ing the nature of the phenomenal world. He uses logic to show that the earth and earthly products are not real if put to the test of logic. The living beings arise from earth and dissolve back into it. Therefore, the cause of the phenomenal world is nothing but the transformation of earth alone. The difference lies only in the names. This is also stated in the Śruti, &ldquo;The modifications of earth

If it is argued that at least the earth element is real, this is answered in verse SB 5.12.9 where Bharata denies that also. He says that earth exists in name only because it is made of paramāņus. The paramāņus themselves are not real because they are just conceptual constructs conceived through ignorance. Earth does not exist as a separate unit as imagined by the Naiyāyikas.
to In the verse cited here, Jaḍa Bharata explains that the object denoted by the word &ldquo;earth&rdquo; is not real because it dissolves into atoms. Does that mean then that the atoms, the cause of earth, are real? He replies, &ldquo;No.&rdquo; To think that earth is made of atoms is only a mental construct born out of avidya, because they do not exist fac- tually or independently without any support. The only Absolute Reality is Paramātmā. It is because of His presence that everything appears real. This is stated in the opening verse of the Bhāgavatam (yatra trisargo&rsquo;mṛṣā). not so that
A whole unit is a manifestation of Paramātmā. This is the pur- port of the verses cited from the Third Canto (SB 3.6.1-3). These verses explain that without the presence of Paramātmā, the mate- rial tattvas do not combine to give rise to the objects of the universe, which include the material bodies. It is for this reason that the Bṛhad-aranyaka Upanisad (3.7.3 ff.) states that earth is the body of Paramātmā. The Upanisad continues to describe that along with earth, the other elements, such as water, fire, air, and so on, are also the body of Paramātmā. This shows that prakṛti and all her modifications, although real, are not independent of Paramātmā.
The purpose of this entire analysis is to dispel the prevalent con- cept of Advaitavada that the world is a mere appearance (vivarta or mithya). Such an erroneous concept is anathema to the path of

10 The Sanskrit word paramāņu, which refers to the smallest, indivisible particle of matter, is commonly translated as &ldquo;atom.&rdquo; It should not, however, beld confused with the atom as defined by modern science, which is itself composed of smaller sub-atomic particles. Modern science also agrees that fundamental matter is difficult to define as existent. Ultimately, matter is energy, and energy cannot exist by itself.

<h2 id="seen">OBJECTION: But is it not so that if everywhere [every] body or composite whole were nothing other than the real existent, Paramātmā (paramätma-vastu), then because bodies acquire designations, such as &ldquo;a brāhmaṇa,&rdquo; Paramātmā would be liable to the rules and prohibitions resulting from the virtues and vices present in such a body, which [in the case of Paramātmā] would be an impossibility? Therefore, should we not admit that the composite whole is necessarily different from Paramātmā? Anticipating such a doubt, Śrī Nārada said:
स्यात् सादृश्यभ्रमस्तावद् विकल्पे सति वस्तुनः । जाग्रत्स्वापौ यथा स्वप्ने तथा विधिनिषेधता ॥ २०७ ॥
As long as a doubt persists in regard to the real existent [i.e., as long as one is unaware that the real existent is Paramātmā], the delusion of the sameness of separate identity (sādṛśya-bhrama) remains. [In that conventional illusory view of self and the world,] the injunctions and prohibitions of scripture still hold good, just as distinctions of waking and sleep persist even in the course of a dream.

In other words, till then one will perceive the body as a sin- gle unit separate from Him (tasmät), i.e., [from the Reality who is] the source of the perception of all [substances] as distinct singular units or composite wholes (sarvaikya-buddhi-nidānāt). पूर्वापरावयवानुसन्धाने सति परस्परमासज्यैकत्र स्थितत्वेनावयवत्वसाधारण्येन चैक्य- सादृश्यात् प्रत्यवयवमेकतया प्रतीतेः सोऽयं देह इति भ्रम एव भवतीत्यर्थः । प्रतिवृक्षं तदिदं वनमितिवत् ।

When one examines the parts [of a substance] sequentially, then because these parts are situated in one locus, being con- nected to one another, and because they give the impression through convention of forming a distinct unity, every part is apparently equated with the whole. Thus follows the delu- sion, &ldquo;This [limb] is this body,&rdquo; just as [it may be said of] each [individual] tree, &ldquo;It is the forest.&rdquo; [All this happens because of ignorance of Paramātmā, the source of the experience of unity (aikya-buddhi).]

For this reason, when a self-concept, such as, &ldquo;I am a brāhmaṇa,&rdquo; is held to in regard to the body, then the injunctions and prohi- bitions related to it are applicable, just as the sense that one is awake or dreaming can both be experienced even in the dream state. To this end, Narada speaks the second half of the [princi- pal] verse [under discussion], namely, that just as [wakefulness and dreaming can both be experienced in the dream state], the rules carry their injunctive force and the regulations their pro- hibitive force [when one adopts the erroneous self-concept of being a brahmana and so on] One should also understand the following verse in the same way:

Further on in the same chapter, one finds the following state- ment: &ldquo;In the midst of duality, which is unreal, the question does not arise what is good and what is bad, and to what extent something is good or bad&rdquo; (SB 11.28.4).5 This statement should be explained in the light of verse SB 7.15.61 above. The meaning is, &ldquo;Duality is the non-reality (avastu); where it is concerned [the question does not arise what is good or bad and to what extent it is so].&rdquo;

A DOUBT IS RAISED with regard to the previous verse. If the body is nothing other than Paramātmā, then designations, such as brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, and so on, would also apply to Him. This implies that Paramātmā would become the subject of scriptural injunctions. But such cannot be the case. Indeed, even a human being permanently established in the self is beyond the injunc- tions of scripture, ātmārāmāś ca munayo nirgrantha apy urukrame (SB 1.7.10). So, in line with this argument, the conclusion that Paramātmā is nondifferent from the individual body is improper, and we should admit that the body or a composite whole is a distinct entity separate from its parts, as proposed by Naiyāyikas.
115
Nārada&rsquo;s reply to this is that as long as a person does not see that there is one Paramātmā in all beings, one is bound to cognize variety and distinctions, such as brāhmaṇa and kṣatriya. In such a state, scriptural injunctions would be applicable. In reality, no unit whole is independent of Paramātmā. We consider the body, etc., as a whole unit, independent of Paramātmā, while in ignorance of

Him. In such a state, one identifies the part with the whole, just as one may refer to a part of an ocean as the ocean. In Bhagavad Gita (18.20-22), while describing the three types of knowledge, Kṛṣṇa says: erb

19And that knowledge by which one becomes attached to a single phe- 29nomenal object or habituated to a conditioned pattern of behavior,
considering it to be everything, and which is irrational, devoid of th golessential truth, and trivial, is called tamasika. (GITA 18.20-22) balles
firang labretem is mon boss
When one is influenced by rajas and tamas, one sees diversity, independent of Paramātmā. In this condition, the rules and regula- tions of the scriptures are applicable. These rules and prohibitions are applicable to the body imagined to be an independent unit, and not to Paramātmā.
Nārada makes the point that as long as one does not recognize Paramātmā as the reality, the delusion of the sameness of separate identity (sädṛśya-bhrama) persists. Because of the delusion caused by similarity of appearance, one is unable to detect that the limbs of a body are changing moment to moment. One thus considers the body viewed in the newly arising present to be the same as that perceived a moment before. This is understood from the examples of a forest, a lamp, and a stream. In a forest the trees are growing and dying, but out of convention a person says that a particular for- est is the same as the one seen in the past. Similarly, the flames

of a lamp arise and are extinguished at every moment, yet when we gaze at a lamp we say that it is the same flame, though factually it is completely different. Similarly, we see that water is flowing continuously in a stream, but we say and think it to be the same stream perceived earlier. All this is due to the similarity between the present and past divisions of a changing object.
alda A person distinguishes between the sense of being awake and the sense of dreaming even in the dream state, though such a dis- tinction does not really exist therein. Similarly, when one identi- fies with the body, not recognizing one Paramātmā as the substra- tum of all, then the prescriptions and prohibitions of sastra become applicable. The injunctions are applicable to the body only and not to Paramātmā. But they are no longer relevant to one who sees directly that everything is Vasudeva (GĪTĀ 7.19). Such a person is called nirgrantha, or beyond the rules of scripture (SB 1.7.10), having ceased from all material pursuit, nivṛtti-nirata (SB 1.7.9).
The injunctions have no purpose for such a person, just as when one wakes up from a dream, he or she recognizes that in the dream state both the sense of being awake and the sense of dreaming are one and the same and without ultimate meaning. Therefore, Śrī Kṛṣṇa advises that one should avoid praising or criticizing another&rsquo;s behavior, seeing the one Paramātmā situated as the real- ity in all. Such praise and blame are like deliberating on a dream as being good or bad.
The conclusion of this topic, begun in Anuccheda 58, is that the universe is not imaginary; it cannot be explained independently of Paramātmā for nothing exists separate from Him. We have seen that modern science has utterly failed in its endeavor to explain the world without reference to a universally interconnected conscious substratum (i.e., Paramātmā).

THE PRESENT VERSE is part of the prayers uttered by Prahlada to Bhagavan Nrsimha, who appeared from a pillar of Hiranyakasipu&rsquo;s palace to kill the latter. His very appearance from the pillar in an extraordinary form proved that He is immanent in everything. Although He was gigantic in size, He manifested from a much smaller pillar. Prahlada was a devotee, and his father, although behaving like an asura, was also a devotee. This incident of Bha- gavan Nrsimha&rsquo;s appearance from a pillar supports the intent of Prahlada&rsquo;s prayer that everything is Bhagavan.

यथोल्मुकाद् विस्फुलिङ्गाद्धूमाद् वापि स्वसम्भवात् । अप्यात्मत्वेनाभिमताद् यथाग्निः पृथगुल्मुकात् ॥ २११ ॥ भूतेन्द्रियान्तःकरणात् प्रधानाज् जीवसञ्ज्ञितात् । आत्मा तथा पृथग् द्रष्टा भगवान् ब्रह्मसञ्ज्ञितः ॥ २१२ ॥
Just as fire is distinct from the sparks and smoke [arising con- ditionally from] the burning kindling wood, of which it is the [fiery] source, and just as it is distinct even from the kindling beewood itself, which is taken to be identical with it, so too the 920
Self, the Seer, Bhagavan, known as Brahman, is distinct from the gross elements, the external senses, the internal senses, pradhana, and [the self] who is called jiva. (SB 3.28.40-41)1

The meaning is as follows: The word ulmuka (a firebrand) means a handheld piece of burning kindling wood used to ignite a fire. The adjectival compound sva-sambhavat (arisen from that to which it belongs) means that this burning kindling wood has fire itself as its own [fiery] source, which is to say that fire is its [unconditional] constituent cause (sva-upädäna-kāraṇa). As such, the kindling wood is [merely] the conditional cause (upadhika-hetu) of the sparks and smoke. So, just as2 fire (agni), which is the constituent cause (upādāna) of sparks and smoke, is different from both of them, and just as it is also different from that very same firebrand (ulmukat), of which it is the con- stituent cause, [so too Bhagavan is different from the jivas, from pradhana, and from the material elements].

What is the nature of these three [substances from which the fire is being differentiated]? They are &ldquo;taken to be identical with the fire,&rdquo; since they appear to have the same essential nature as fire in that they give off heat, and even in smoke a portion of fire is directly present.

The two verses, which form a single sentence, are split apart in the gloss. So the word yatha (&ldquo;just as&rdquo;) is read with tatha (&ldquo;in the same way&rdquo;), which begins the second paragraph after this one.
There is a source of confusion in the first verse, which repeats both the words yatha (&ldquo;just as&rdquo;) and ulmukat (&ldquo;from / than the firebrand&rdquo;). Different commentators have dealt with the problem in different ways. Jiva Gosvāmi takes the two instances as referring to the same firebrand or kindling torch, the first time when the sparks arise from it, and the second time to say that the fire is different from it even as it burns. land old bad

(upādāna) of all categories of being, is different from the liv- ing entity, called the jiva, which is compared to a spark [in the example]; and from pradhana, which is the conditional efful- gence of Bhagavan limited by primordial matter (pradhana) and here compared to a firebrand; and from the material elements, etc., which are compared to the smoke.
य एवात्मा स्वांशेन तत्तदन्तर्यामितया परमात्मा क्वचिदधिकारिणि निर्विशेषचिन्मात्रतया स्फुरन् ब्रह्मसञ्ज्ञितश्च यत एव द्रष्टा तेषामादिमध्यान्तावस्थासाक्षीति ।
This very Bhagavan is the Self (ātmā), namely Paramātmā, who is immanent in the above three entities by His personal portion (svämśa), and who is also sometimes called Brahman when man- ifesting Himself simply as unqualified consciousness to one eli- gible for such realization. This is because He is the Seer (draṣṭā), the witness of the beginning, middle, and end states of all the above.
यथोल्मुकादिदानीं ज्वलतः काष्ठात् स्वसम्भवादग्नेः सम्भूतादात्मत्वेनाग्नेः स्वरूपत्वेनाभि- मतादप्यत्यन्ताविवेकिनो हि धूमेऽप्यग्यभिमानोऽस्तीति धूमादित्यप्युक्तम् । उल्मुकात् पूर्वसिद्धादपि तद्दाहकः प्रकाशकश्चाग्निः पृथगेव तथा भूतेन्द्रियान्तःकरणादिभ्यः परमात्म- त्वेन भगवत्त्वेन ब्रह्मसञ्ज्ञितत्वेन च शब्दितो द्रष्टा तदशेषज्ञः पृथगेव तेषां बहिरङ्गतटस्थ- शक्तिमयत्वादित्यर्थः ॥ श्रीकपिलदेवः ॥
As those completely devoid of discrimination call even smoke fire, although the smoke is different from the currently burn- ing kindling wood (ulmukat) and from its own source (sva- sambhavat), fire, with which it is thought to be one in essence, the word dhūmāt [different from smoke] has consequently also been used. The fire that burns and illuminates the kindling wood (ulmukat) is certainly separate from it, even though this wood exists prior to the fire. Similarly, the Seer who knows all things without limitation, and who is signified by the names Paramātmā, Bhagavan, and Brahman, is indeed different from the material elements, the external senses, the internal senses, and so on, for they consist of the extrinsic and intermediary potencies.us Amtimes to porto add diw beartat el norbor

AFTER SHOWING that the universe, the body, the sense objects, and the material elements are not independent and thus not different from Paramātmā, Śrī Jīva establishes that Paramātmā is distinct from all these, including the jivas. In Anuccheda 60, he demon- strated that although an effect is not different from its cause, the cause is not absolutely one with its effect. The cause exists indepen- dent of its effect. The first principle - that an effect is nondifferent from its cause was elaborated in Anucchedas 61 to 67. The second is being explained in the present anuccheda. The example given is of fire, which is distinct from the cinder, smoke, and sparks, all of which are themselves caused by fire. In the same way, Paramātmā is different from everything material, beginning from the gross elements all the way up to pradhana, because He is the witness of all the modifications in them. The seer is always distinct from the
seen.</h2>
<p>The word ātmā in the second verse refers to Paramātmā, being read together with Bhagavan and Brahman. The three different realizations of the One Reality are related to the three different types of transcendentalists. This subject was treated in great detail in Bhagavat Sandarbha (Anuccheda 2). In the verse preceding the principal verse cited in the present anuccheda, Bhagavan Kapila said that just as a father is different from his son as well as his wealth, so too is the ātmā different from the body. It is easy enough to recognize how a person is different from his possessions and rel- atives, but not so easy to perceive how the ātmā is separate from the body and senses, and then to further understand how Param- ātmā is different from the ātmā. For this reason, Bhagavan Kapila spoke the two verses under discussion. He continues to speak on the same theme in the subsequent verses.nl draw
Here pradhana is compared to the burning kindling wood, the jiva to the sparks, and the body and senses, both external and internal, to the smoke, while Paramātmā is compared to the fire. Pradhana is infused with the potency of Paramātmā and only then

is it activated, just as kindling wood is enabled to burn when infused with fire. For this reason Śri Jiva describes it as upadhika- bhagavat-tejas, the conditional effulgence of Bhagavan. The jīva in its conditioned state is never completely free from its designations, so in the state of dissolution it becomes merged into pradhana from which it is manifested once again at the time of the next cycle of
creation.
As seen earlier, Bhagavan impregnates pradhana with the liv- ing entities (mama yonir mahad brahma tasmin garbham dadhamy aham, GĪTĀ 14.3). Just as sparks fly away from burning kindling wood along with the smoke, in the same way, the jivas, together with their bodies, senses, and mind, manifest from pradhana after it has been impregnated by Paramātmā. This is also described in the Brhad-aranyaka Upanisad (2.1.20).
Next, Śrī Jiva will explain that true perception depends upon the perceiver, and hence the world is viewed differently by different people.

The mind that is not existent (asat) in You, i.e., not abiding in You, being threefold, meaning that it abides instead in the uni- verse that is a product of the three gunas, appears as if exis- tent (sad iva) or present in You. The meaning is, rather, that the mind most certainly does not appear to be present [in You] because, like the ladle that does not taste the curry [in which it is immersed], such a mind does not perceive Paramātmā who is present in the world in which the mind is fully immersed. There- fore, the asat (phenomenal or unreal) aspect is said to be either &ldquo;made of maya consisting of the three gunas&rdquo; or &ldquo;made of mind.&rdquo; As it is said:
यदिदं मनसा वाचा चक्षुर्भ्यां श्रवणादिभिः ।

But those who know the Self (atma-vidaḥ), meaning those who know You, consider (abhimṛṣanti) this whole universe up to and including the human beings (a-manujāt), i.e., the conditional forms of the jivas, to be real (sat) due to its being a manifesta- tion of the Self (ätmataya), or in other words, as Your form. The sense is that their sights are set solely on the real or noumenal (sat) aspect and not elsewhere.

An example in this regard is given in the second half of the verse (SB 10.87.26 ). Gold merchants, who are looking for gold alone, are not concerned with the outward appearance of gold&rsquo;s modifica- tions (kanaka-vikāra), such as whether they are of a beautiful or unattractive design, since they are interested only in the pure gold itself. The sense is that the knowers of the Self do the same [in regard to Paramātmā]. 3on aspb sads albel ad all anusand

Then, even after the world manifesta- tion was completed, You Yourself entered into it in two ways, as its unremitting cause and as the Immanent Self. Again, at the time of dissolution also, the world terminates as the Self, or in other words, in the form of Your real Self qualified by real poten- cies.&rdquo; The same [threefold relation] should also be understood in the example [i.e., of the gold and its modifications].

IF THE UNIVERSE is nondifferent from Paramātmā, then why does not everyone perceive it to be so? Śrī Jiva answers this question by citing a verse spoken by the Vedas personified to Paramātmā at the beginning of creation. They say that because the minds of mate- rialistic people are fixed on sense objects, they fail to detect the underlying principle behind the universe and only grapple with the material aspect made up of the three gunas. neblog nedtorfw
The Vedas personified provide three reasons why the universe is to be considered as nondifferent from Paramātmā. First, He is its constituent cause, particularly by His potency of &ldquo;being,&rdquo; or &ldquo;exis- tence&rdquo; (sat). This implies that when the universe is manifest, the existence of every object in it is a manifestation of Paramatma&rsquo;s potency of being. After creating the universe, He pervades it as its unremitting cause and also enters into it as the Immanent Self. Finally, when the universe is dissolved, it is enfolded once again into Him. Thus, the universe has no existence separate from Him.
Śrī Jiva compares this situation to golden ornaments. Gold is the constituent cause of the ornaments. Gold also pervades the ornaments while they exist in various shapes and designs. Finally, if the ornaments are melted in fire, they remain as nothing other than gold. Golden ornaments, therefore, have no existence sepa- rate from gold. People in general, however, are more concerned with the shape and design of the golden ornaments and are less

Śrī Kṛṣṇa says in Bhagavad Gita, &ldquo;As one approaches Me, so do I reveal Myself to him&rdquo; (GĪTĀ 4.11). When a person is oblivious to Paramātmā, then Paramātmā remains covered by the veil of His māyā (GĪTĀ 7.25). Such a person remains bewildered by the mate- rial manifestation and cannot perceive the transcendental reality (GĪTĀ 7.13). These people are compared to a ladle being used to serve curry. Even though the ladle is immersed in the curry, it cannot know the wonderful taste of the preparation by which it is encompassed.
On the other hand, those who are devoted to Paramātmā see Him in everything (GĪTĀ 7.19, 6.30-31). Such people are compared to the merchant in quest of gold. He does not concern himself with whether a golden ornament is well designed or unattractive. He is exclusively interested in the gold itself. The shape is immaterial. Even if the golden ornament is covered with filth, he does not reject it. His mind is fixed on the essential material that has been used in making the ornament.
Treget This section deals with an important aspect of epistemology. Śrī Jiva Gosvāmi, on the authority of the Śruti prayers, shows that the same object is perceived differently by the unawakened and the spiritually awake because of their disparate visions. The question naturally arises, &ldquo;Which of the two visions corresponds to reality?&rdquo; The answer is that it is the spiritually awake who have the true per- spective, because it is unconditional and absolute. The vision of the unawakened is many branched and unstable. But the vision of the transcendentalist is one-pointed. Perception is not dependent merely on the instruments of perception but also on the reality- view of the perceiver. For example, it is said that when the Pilgrims first arrived on the shores of America, the indigenous tribal people were unable to discern the ship because they had no conception of a

IN THIS WAY, we have established that the universe is a trans- formation of Paramatma&rsquo;s energy [śakti-pariņāma-vāda] and refuted the theory of illusion (vivarta). Therefore, the world is not false like a rope mistaken for a snake, as held by the fol- lowers of vivarta-vada; rather, it is perishable like a clay pot. So, although the universe is not false, it is not fundamentally real (sat) because it does not exist in all three phases of time [past, present, and future]. Since both vivarta and pariņāma [as understood by the non-theistic Sankhya philosophers] have proven to be inadequate explanations [of the reality or non- reality of the world], only that substantive which is free from these two defects, such as Paramātmā or His intrinsic potency, can be ordained as real.

pronoun &ldquo;this&rdquo; (idam) refers to the universe [which is described as sat].

THE BASIC PRINCIPLE of the Bhāgavata Purana as well as the Upanisads is that there is only one Absolute Reality. The world has appeared from that one Reality. So, in accordance with this Upanisadic view, there are two theories as to how the world is rooted in the Absolute.
The vivarta-vāda theory holds that if the Absolute, called Brahman, were considered to be the constituent cause (upādāna- kāraṇa) that undergoes modification to give rise to the world, then Brahman Itself would be subject to modification, which is not acceptable to any school. So, the only alternative they could conceive of is vivarta-vāda, which in their view signifies that Brah- man is qualityless and the world is unreal, a mere appearance in Brahman. taupe zi 31 sansvinu testins ad of valen (aidi) mobi
The Bhāgavata Purana does not support the vivarta-vāda pro- pounded by Advaitavada, as has been established in the previous anucchedas. According to the opinion of the Bhagavatam, the Abso- lute has real potency, called pradhana or mayā, which undergoes modifications to give rise to the world. Such modifications do not entail any change in the essential identity, or svarupa, of the Absolute. This is called śakti-pariņāma-vāda, &ldquo;the world as a real transformation of the Absolute&rsquo;s real potency,&rdquo; as summarized by Bhagavan Śrī Kṛṣṇa and cited above in Anuccheda 58:
Prakṛti is the constituting cause (upādāna) of this reality [the universe]; the Supreme Person (para-purusa) is its substratum

bac(adhāra); and time its manifestor (abhivyañjaka). But I am q hr Brahman, which comprehends these three. (SB 11.24.19)1 dsds at namdard to grans das rotoladusati ni savions
From this broader ontological perspective, the reason for which vivarta-vāda was posited as necessary in the first place no longer holds. When the word asat (unreal) is used for the world, the vivarta-vādīs take it to mean mithya, false or illusory, while the pariņāma-vādīs take it to mean &ldquo;real but temporary.&rdquo; This is the difference between their explanations.
The term sat, or real, applies specifically to an object that exists in all phases of time - past, present, and future; that which does not exist in all phases of time is called asat, or unreal. In this case, sat and asat are being defined exclusively in reference to existence. In reference to causality, however, an effect is regarded as real if its cause is real, and unreal if its cause is unreal. Uniting these two perspectives, the words sat and asat, applied to one and the same object, signify a real but changing object. The universe, therefore, is sometimes called sat and sometimes asat.
The mantra cited from Chandogya states, &ldquo;My dear, prior [to its creation], this existed as Reality (sat) alone&rdquo; (sad eva saumyedam agra āsīt, CHU 6.2.1). Earlier in the same Upanisad it was said that by knowledge of the cause, one acquires knowledge of the effect. The present mantra is spoken to confirm this fact. The pronoun idam (this) refers to the manifest universe. It is equated with sat, which alone existed in the past (āsīt) when the universe was not yet manifest.

universe was born of asat. In fact, this idea is posited as the counter- statement in the Upanisad, just after the above mantra: &ldquo;Some [Naiyayikas] propose that in the beginning, there was only asat, one without a second, and it is from asat that sat was born.&rdquo; In the succeeding mantra, however, this view is refuted by posing a ques- tion, &ldquo;But, my dear boy, how can this be so? How can the existent come from the non-existent?&rdquo;
The sat-karya-vāda holds that the effect exists in its cause in a subtle or potential form. Pariņāma-väda includes sat-karya-vāda within its scope and thus considers the universe to be a trans- formation of Paramātmā&rsquo;s extrinsic energy, called māyā. The pariņāma-vāda accepted by Jiva Gosvāmī is not the same as that put forth by the classical non-theistic Sankhya School, because the latter view would imply that Paramātmā Himself undergoes modifications in order to create the world. In the śakti-pariņāma- vāda, however, it is only the sakti of Paramātmā that undergoes modification, while Paramātmā (or Brahman in Vedantic terminol- ogy) remains unchanged. Thus, Paramātmā remains free from the defect of modification while still being the constituent cause of the universe. This is the principle underlying Jiva Gosvāmi&rsquo;s metaphys- ical view known as acintya-bheda-abheda-vada, &ldquo;the transrational accommodation of distinction within nondistinction.&rdquo;

Then [arguing the counter position of vivarta-vada] they deny this by asking [rhetorically]: &ldquo;Is this not against logic?&rdquo; since the word sataḥ (&ldquo;from reality&rdquo;), being in the ablative case, implies a difference between the source and the object produced, which is a case of contradictory reasoning (viruddha-hetu) [i.e., the very reason given to prove the identity of cause and effect turns out to contradict it instead].

Commentary
the alrell
If Brahman, the unchanging Reality (sat), is the cause of the universe, then the universe must also be an unchanging reality, because an effect should have the characteristics of its upādāna cause, the ingredients that make it up. The opponent argues that since this is clearly not the case, it must be concluded that the uni- verse is unreal (asat). This is the first objection to the conclusion borne out by pariņāma-vāda, namely, that the universe is a chang- ing reality, unlike its source. But if the universe is perishable, then why would this not support the theory of vivarta-vāda? This is the second objection.
The first objection addresses itself to the five-step syllogism on the pattern of the Nyaya School, as follows: Injeros doidw of</li>

It is objected that this inference is faulty because an effect may not have all the qualities of its cause. For example, light does not burn even though it is generated from fire. The hetu, or premise, which is the second step used in this syllogism, is not proper, but a hetu-ābhāsa (a fallacious reason) of the anaikantika type, mean- ing that the concomitance of the reason (hetu) with that which it attempts to prove (the sädhya, or proposition, pratijñā) is not abso- lute. In Western logic, this is called the fallacy of the undistributed middle, wherein the middle term (or the reason) in a syllogism is not distributed either to the minor premise or to the major premise.
In an inference, there are five steps: pratijñā, or the proposition; hetu, or the reason (the probans, or the middle term); udāharaṇa, or the universal principle with an illustrative example; upanaya, or the application of the universal principle; and nigamana, or the conclusion. The proposition states what is to be inferred or proven (the sadhya).
The locus, or object, in which something is to be inferred, is called the paksa (the minor term), what is proven to exist in the pakṣa is called the sadhya (the probandum, or the major term), and the reason used to prove the existence of the sadhya is called the hetu (the probans, or the middle term). The hetu and sadhya must coexist for the syllogism to be valid. This is called the universal concomitance (vyāpti) between the middle term (the hetu) and the major term (the sadhya), or in other words, the distribution of the middle term into the major premise. When a hetu has some flaw in it, it is called hetu-abhasa, a fallacious hetu, or a mere semblance of a hetu.

There are five types of hetu-abhāsa. When the middle term (the hetu, or cause) exists in the minor term (the paksa, or object in which something is to be proven), but the major term (the sadhya, or thing to be proven) is non-existent in the locus of the hetu (i.e., in the minor term), it is called anaikantika-hetu-ābhāsa, the flaw of the undistributed middle (sādhyābhāvavad-vṛttitva, Tarka-sangraha 1.8).

<li>Therefore, the mountain is on fire.
bag to be
This inferential reasoning (anumana) is fraught with hetu- abhāsa. Knowability also exists in a lake, which is not a substra- tum of fire, so the hetu fails the test of universal applicability, or vyapti. Therefore, when the words tarka-hata are used in the verse, it refers to this kind of error - it is illogical to make such an inference.
Moreover, the universe is not a superimposition [on Brahman], like silver on an oyster shell, because the verse says utthita, &ldquo;it has arisen,&rdquo; meaning that it has been produced. In the case of mistaking an oyster shell for a piece of silver, one superimposes one&rsquo;s experience of silver onto the shell because of the resemblance between the two. It is not that the silver arises, or is produced, from the shell. Therefore, this verse does not support vivarta-vāda.
Furthermore, the word sataḥ is in the ablative case (&ldquo;from, than&rdquo;), which signifies a difference between the universe and its source, the Absolute, sat. This means that the universe has charac- teristics different from Brahman, as well as similar ones. In this case, it is perishable, although real.
(
The second verse cited from Vişnu Purana, along with Śrīdhara Svami&rsquo;s comments, illustrates how an effect can have characteris- tics different from those of its cause. Fire is situated in one place, but the light emanating from it spreads all around. Similarly, fire burns an inflammable object, but light does not. In the same man- ner, Bhagavan&rsquo;s energies, such as the universe, issue forth from Him. The universe is different from Brahman in the sense that it is not imperishable, and similar to Him in that it is not imaginary. To summarize, Śrī Jiva Gosvāmi interprets these Śruti prayers as supporting the following conclusions:</li>

To this, the next opponent (vivarta-vādi) argues that since this fallacy, which fails to establish the universe as real (sat), is present, then why not just accept the universe as illusory (asat), like the false silver that is no more than an appearance on an oyster shell? This proposition is put forth because of the similarity involved in the comparison. The characteristics of silver are uniquely different from those of an oyster shell, the source of the &ldquo;so-called&rdquo; appear- ance of false silver. The universe is also proven to have characteris- tics different than Brahman. Since the silver perceived in an oyster shell is illusory, it naturally follows by comparison with this exam- ple that the universe is illusory, too. The five-step syllogism is as follows:</li>

all To this, the Śrutis reply that an object cannot be unreal just because it is perceived differently from its source. Rather, it is determined as unreal if it is incapable of being put to practical use, meaning that it is incapable of exerting causal force or in produc- ing successful activity. In the case of the silver perceived in an oys- ter shell, one cannot take it and sell it in the marketplace or use it to make an ornament, because in fact, there is no real silver. But such is not the case with the universe. We have our empirical deal- ings in it, and thus it is real, though not imperishable like its cause, Paramātmā.

[Reply:] Anticipating this objection, the Śrutis reply: &ldquo;Only for the sake of worldly transactions [is such a false cognition (vika- lpa) accepted].&rdquo; Only for the sake of [unethical] business deal- ings in the form of buying and selling (vyavahṛtaye) is such a false presentation [of counterfeit coins] sought, but not for their well-known rightful usages. One will not receive the benefit of piety by donating such a fake coin. Similarly, one who buys the roots of a poisonous plant [visa-granthi, such as the arka plant, whose roots resemble ginger] sold as dry ginger and then eats it, thinking it to be so, will not be alleviated from his dis- ease but will be killed instead. Therefore, the reality of the uni- verse is accepted because of its multifaceted well-known proper (samyak) utility in producing successful activity. Such utility or functional effectivity is, however, partially present in the illu- sory snake in the form of the fear that it instigates, but such fear- inducing effectivity is not the cause of real action [i.e., it cannot result in a person&rsquo;s being factually bitten].

require it to be real. The example given is of counterfeit currency: One can buy things even with fake bills.
the The answer to this is that the fake bills may be instrumental in buying and selling things, but in reality they have no utility. For example, if one donates fake money as part of a religious ceremony, one will not reap the expected benefits of a pious act from such a donation. This is because the bestower of the result, God or the gods, is not in illusion about the truth or falsehood of the act. Again, if one buys counterfeit medicine and consumes it thinking that he will be cured, he may rather contract an iatrogenic disease. Thus, there is no real utility in an imaginary object.sab Innolinovno
The vivarta-vādi argues back: But there is partial utility or func- tional effectivity even in imaginary objects. Is it not the case that when one mistakes a rope for a snake or sees a plastic snake, he becomes fearful, his heartbeat increases, and he may even run away?
The reply here again is that such an occurrence is not real func- tionality either. In other words, even if one becomes fearful on mis- taking a rope for a snake or on seeing a plastic snake, the rope mis- perceived as a snake will not bite him. One becomes fearful because of the belief that the snake is real. Once a person realizes that the snake is in fact a rope, the fear vanishes, even though to outward appearances the rope may continue to resemble the snake. The rope misperceived as a snake has no ability to bite and kill a person.
The same is true of counterfeit coins or bills. If a merchant real- izes that the bills tendered are fake, he will not accept them. Rather, he may inform the police. Thus, an illusory object does not have utility. It seems to have utility only because someone perceives it as real. The utility is thus superimposed onto it as one superimposes a false appearance onto a real object.

Moreover, the Śrutis say, &ldquo;[Worldly transactions are perpetu- ated] through the blind succession of past conventions.&rdquo; These conventional dealings, such as buying and selling [by using fake coins], are not like the commerce connected to real coins by experts in such affairs, but are merely the result of blindly fol- lowing past traditions. Thus, because such [fraudulent] deal- ings are not possible with those who are expert in recognizing genuine coinage, one should not infer otherwise merely because of the resemblance of the former to genuine commerce. It is certainly appropriate that the mere [mistaken] appearance of smoke would lead to a fallacious inference about the presence of fire.
Commentary
13867
Even if it is accepted that counterfeit currency can be used to deal in the market, such dealings are possible only because of ignorance. As soon as one realizes that a coin is counterfeit, one refuses to accept it and, if honest, would not be inclined to use it to buy any- thing. So such use of fake coins does not really establish their util- ity, but only shows that they have a contingent utility, i.e., they will work only as long as people do not recognize them as fake. In other words, their utility is based upon the misconception that they are real. Therefore, genuine utility is found only in authentic coins.
It is taken as axiomatic that wherever there is fire, there is smoke. Therefore, if one sees smoke from afar, say on top of a high- rise building, one may infer that the building is on fire. But sup- pose one mistakes a small patch of cloud on top of a mountain for

smoke and concludes that the mountain is on fire; in such a case the inference will certainly be wrong. Similarly, if one concludes that counterfeit coins have real functional utility just because some foolish people and criminals make use of them, his inference would be utterly wrong.

Therefore, because the universe has some practical utility, it cannot be false and must be real. With this, the Vedas personified have refuted vivarta-vada. The next portion of the verse refutes the Mimāṁsakas, who consider the universe to be eternal and thus argue against pariņāma-vāda.

[Reply:] Anticipating this objection, the Śrutis reply [last quar- ter of the verse]: &ldquo;[Your words] delude (bhramayati). O Bhaga- vän, Your words [in the sastra] through their manifold powers of expressions (uru-vṛttibhiḥ), namely, their secondary (gauna) and indicative (lakṣaṇā) forces or functions, delude those whose intelligence is dulled by the formal structure of Vedic hymnody (uktha-jaḍān).&rdquo; The word uktha refers to those hymns or verses in scripture that enjoin sacrificial performances. The dull- witted (jaḍā) in respect of such hymns are those whose intel- ligence has been blunted by the burden of exorbitant faith in Vedic rituals.

The sense is this: The Vedas [in the statements cited above] do not intend to say that the result of their sacrificial rituals is eter- nal, but merely to glorify them through the indicative sense or implied meaning (lakṣaṇā). This is because the import of state- ments other than injunctions, being subservient to [specific] injunctions, culminates only in the injunctions themselves [and not in any independent conclusion]. Otherwise, it would lead to the fault of conflicting assertions (vakya-bheda) and would also contradict other texts found in the Śruti and supported by the logic of Vedanta, such as, &ldquo;Just as the enjoyment earned by

The hermeneutical principles associated with primary, indicative, and implied

The word uktha specifically refers to a kind of recitation or certain recited verses forming a subdivision of the śästras, which generally form a series to be recited in contradistinction to the Saman verses, which are sung, and to the Yajus, or muttered sacrificial formulas (cf. Monier-Williams). Here the meaning is taken in a more general sense.

Thus, [that the world is eternal] is only a misunderstanding of those who are foolishly attached to the fruits of their karma. In fact, the universe, even though real, is perishable because of its ever-changing character.

&ldquo;11
Commentary abril odio avview ansbasqebai yllut one anot adue bra vi elqqua Śrī Jiva explains the remaining portion of the verse as a refutation of the Mimämsaka philosophy, which holds the world to be not only real but also imperishable. The common understanding of all the- istic philosophers of India is that the universe undergoes cycles of creation and destruction. But the Mīmāmsakas do not subscribe to this view. They hold that the universe was never created and will never be destroyed. Kumārila writes, &ldquo;We do not accept any such time when the universe was created.&ldquo;12 He gives various argu- ments for adopting this position. The real reason for this is their belief that karma can lead to eternal residence in heaven. In sup- port of this idea, they cite statements from the Vedic scriptures that assure an unending stay in heaven as the outcome of some rit- uals prescribed therein. For this to be true, heaven must be eternal, which naturally means that the universe is eternal.
Śrī Jiva comments that this notion is arrived at only because of the Mimāmsakas&rsquo; misunderstanding of the statements of the Vedas, which can be interpreted in different ways according to

their primary, indicated, or implied meanings. The Mimāmsaka in this regard takes the Vedic statements literally, accepting the direct meaning of the words that describe an eternal residence in heaven for the pious performer of the sacrifice. Śrī Jīva, however, takes these statements to be part of the artha-vada, i.e., laudatory
passages.
According to Pūrva-mīmāmsā, there are five types of state- ments in the Veda, namely: injunctions (vidhi), prohibition (nise- dha), names (nämadheya), mantra, and laudatory or explanatory passages (artha-vada). The real import of the Veda, according to Jai- mini, is in its injunctions, or vidhis-codana-lakṣano&rsquo;rtho dharmah (Mīmāṁsā-sutra 1.1.2). Therefore, the purpose of all Vedic passages is found in its vidhi statements or injunctions. As such, the injunc- tions are fully independent, whereas other kinds of statements are supplementary and subsidiary to them.
If these secondary statements are accepted as independent, the defect known as vakya-bheda, or &ldquo;conflicting injunctions,&rdquo; comes about. Whenever there are mutually opposing injunctions, confu- sion in the mind of the executor naturally follows. For example, there is a statement, &ldquo;One should perform sacrifice with rice or with barley&rdquo; (vrihibhir yajet yavair vā). Here it is not clear whether rice has to be used or barley. Both cannot be used simultaneously, and if one is used then the other is left out. This results in the defect of vakya-bheda.
In the present context, if apama somam, etc. (&ldquo;We have drunk soma juice and become immortal&rdquo;) is taken as an independent state- ment, then there will be two separate injunctions, apāma somam amṛtā abhūma, and somena yajeta (&ldquo;One should sacrifice with the soma juice&rdquo;), creating an apparent conflict. But if the first state- ment, which does not contain a potential verb (vidhi-lin), is taken as an artha-vāda, or as subsidiary to the subsequent statement, which does carry injunctive force (yajeta), then the confusion is avoided.
This understanding is also supported by another statement from the Chandogya Upanisad, cited in the text, which explains that the result of karma is perishable. Thus, the statement, apāma
468
Hal-ha 70 Pariņāma-vāda siff
somam amṛtā abhūma, cannot be taken in its primary sense, but in a secondary sense, meaning &ldquo;a long time.&rdquo; As a result, the Purva- mīmāmsakas, who base their understanding on the world being imperishable, are misguided. Even the famous Mimāṁsā author- ity Kumārila Bhatta has accepted the dissolution of the universe on the authority of the Purana and Itihasa13
13
It is to be further noted that wherever Mimämsä accepts the dissolution and creation of the universe, they do so only partially; they do not accept complete annihilation. Otherwise, they in turn explain that the statements in the Vedas or Purānas confirming creation and dissolution are only a kind of artha-vada in that they serve as explanations to injunctions (vidhi)14

The Śrutis then refute [this defense of] nondifference by refer- ring to the mutual differences among the three well-known grades of existence (satta), saying, &ldquo;Sometimes there is &lsquo;de- gradation&rdquo;&rdquo;: In some cases (kva ca), even when there is practi- cal utility (artha-kriya-käritva), such as in a clay pot, there is downgrading [from the absolute to the empirical grade of exis- tence];&rdquo; to complete the sense here, the word sattă (&ldquo;category of existence&rdquo;) is to be added [as the subject of the verb vyabhica- rati, yielding the sense, &ldquo;Sometimes the category of existence is downgraded&rdquo;]. [Three reasons are tendered to show such down- grading from the absolute to the empirical grade of existence:] Because of the [empirical] object&rsquo;s incapacity to demonstrate the causal efficiency related to another object, because it itself does not exist in another place, and because it will disappear after some time. [By contrast, the ontological existent is the basis of the causal efficiency of all objects, exists in all places, and is eternal.]

[The Śrutis go on:] &ldquo;And sometimes the grade of existence is false.&rdquo; Moreover, on occasion (kva ca), as in the [example of] sil- ver in an oyster shell, the existence is altogether false (mṛṣā) in that very place and at that very moment, because of the absence of causal efficiency (artha-kriya-kāritva).
या तूभययुगुभयत्र घटादिसत्तायां शुक्तिरजतादिसत्तायां च युग् योगो यस्याः सा सा
16 The three grades of existence are paramarthika, the absolute or ontological
reality, which is compared to the gold in gold ornaments, or to clay in a clay pot; pratibhäsika, illusory reality, which is purely mental or subjective and is exemplified by the misperception of a rope as a snake, or of silver in the oyster shell. The third satta is called vyavahärika, conventional or empirical reality. 17 The satta of a clay pot is not the same as the satta of Brahman, even though a clay pot has practical utility, which signifies sattä. There are three reasons for this as the explained in the text.

Therefore, although the universe is real because of its utility, it is yet perishable like a clay pot due to being subject to trans- formation. It has neither illusory existence (pratita-mătra- sattāka) nor imperishable existence. This means that if one sees mutually opposing qualities, then how can one [grade of existence] be another?
Commentary
Śrī Jiva begins an alternative explanation of the verse. Previously it was explained that the second line of the verse is a reply to the objection raised in the first, &ldquo;It is not that nondifference is being established between Paramātmā and the universe, but that the difference is denied.&rdquo;
In the first explanation, this was done by interpreting the words vyabhicarati (deviates) and mṛşă (false) as refuting the inference found in the first line. Now the same words will be interpreted by showing the difference between the three grades of existence as described in the Advaita Vedanta system.dogog hagy

III The Ontology of Maya - Bahiranga-sakti
Absolute or ontological existence (päramärthika-satta) is the support of all causal efficiency (artha-kriya-käritä), and exists at all times and places. Empirical existence (vyavahārika-satta) has prac- tical utility, as in a clay pot, but it is not universal. Thus, empirical existence involves a &ldquo;de-gradation&rdquo; (vyabhicāra), or in other words, a downgrade from the Absolute Reality, vyabhicarati kva ca.
As for illusory objects (prätibhäsika-sattā), such as the silver perceived in an oyster shell, they neither have practical utility nor do they exist at all times and in all places. In other words, even though we may have some experience of such objects, their existence is not real but false, kva ca mṛṣā.
Absolute existence (päramärthika-sattā) is in Paramātmā alone and thus never undergoes any type of change. It is ubhaya-yuk (inclusive of both), in that it has both causal efficiency (artha-kriya- kāritā) and real existence. The word ubhaya-yuk signifies that the existence of both empirical and illusory objects is dependent upon the absolute existent, or the ontologically Real, Paramātmā. Thus, the universe is not different from Him, yet it is not absolutely one, abheda, with Him. Although real, it is subject to transformation, but it is not illusory like the silver in an oyster shell, because it has utility, artha-kriya-käritä. Hence vivarta-vada again stands refuted.

Anticipating the doubt of the counterfeit coin, the Śrutis say, &ldquo;The real object (vikalpa) is sought for the sake of worldly trans- actions,&rdquo; etc. [In this alternative explanation] the word vikalpa [lit., &ldquo;false cognition&rdquo;] instead refers to something that can be imaged (vikalpyate), meaning that it can be mentally superim- posed upon another object elsewhere present (anyatraropyate).

As such, vikalpa refers to a self-evident [real] object, like a cop- per coin. Such a real object alone is desirable for conventional dealings.

The sense is as follows: Here the dealing that you believe to be effected because of counterfeit coins is not really accom- plished by them, but is possible only because of [the existence of] real coins; for although the coins may be fake, the person who accepts them takes them to be real. The fake coins here are only a token of something else, for sometimes even without any such coins one can cheat by saying, &ldquo;I have already left the coins at your house or I shall give them later,&rdquo; and execute one&rsquo;s dealing on the basis of the other person&rsquo;s knowledge of coins.
तस्माद् व्यवहाररूपाप्यर्थक्रियाकारिता तस्यैव भवतीति स सत्य एव । अन्यथा सत्यस्य ताम्रिकस्याभावे शतमप्यन्धानां न पश्यतीति न्यायेन कूटताम्रिकपरम्परयापि व्यवहा- रोऽपि न सिध्येदित्याहुः “अन्धपरम्परया” इति । अन्धपरम्परादोषात् स एव व्यवहृतय इषित इत्यन्वयः । यथान्धपरम्परया व्यवहारो न सिध्येत् तथा कूटताम्रिकपरम्परयापी- त्यर्थः ।
Therefore, the practical utility (artha-kriyā kāritā) even in the form of [such] dealings is also only [on the basis] of that which is real; otherwise, if there were no real coins, then by the prin- ciple, “Even a hundred blind men together cannot see,” no busi- ness transaction could be effectuated, no matter how many fake coins were passed in a chain from one to another. And so the Śrutis say, &ldquo;through a succession of blind following&rdquo; (andha- paramparaya). The real object is itself required for practical dealings due to the defects resulting from a succession of blind following. This is the proper understanding of this sentence. The meaning is that just as worldly transactions cannot be accomplished through a chain of blind following, in the same
473

way, one cannot have any [legitimate] dealing through fake coins passed down in succession either.
Commentary
empirical
श्रीशाक
The second half of the verse is being explained in accordance with its alternative interpretation. After demonstrating that the empir- ical and illusory grades of existence (satta) are distinct from and dependent upon the ontologically real, Śrī Jiva next examines the practical reality of vyavahārika-satta, or the existence of objects in the phenomenal world. Sankara accepts empirical existence as one of the three grades of reality, but ultimately he denies the reality of the phenomenal world because it is only an appearance, like a snake misperceived as a rope. Śrī Jiva refutes this notion while explaining the above verse. He makes the point that anything that is unreal cannot have practical utility (artha-kriya-kāritā) — the water in a mirage cannot quench anyone&rsquo;s thirst.
The vivarta-vādi defends his position by arguing that fake coins also have utility. So in the same way, the world has utility, and yet, like fake coins, it is not real. To refute this, the verse says that for the accomplishment of worldly dealings (vyavahṛtaye), one requires (işita) a real object (vikalpa). In this alternative expla- nation, Jiva Gosvāmī interprets the word vikalpa differently, as a real object that can be superimposed onto something else, anyatra- ropyate iti vikalpah. This is possible only if the original object is real. In the case of a rope being mistaken for a snake, the snake is a real living being. One cannot mistake one object for another if the projected object has no existence, such as the horn of a rabbit. Such a meaning of the word vikalpa is uncommon, yet not without foundation.wolle birt

TbThe dealing accomplished with fake coins is not because of the fake coins themselves, but because the receiver of such coins believes them to be real, whether the person who gives them knows they are fake or not. So ultimately any such dealing is enacted based on the belief that the coins are real.
474
Hak sya 70 Pariņāma-vādas m
EiIn fact, an expert swindler can also manage to deceive someone even without any coins at all if he is able to convince his victim that he has delivered the coins to his house or will deliver them later, even if he has no such intention. In this case also, even though there are no coins involved, the transaction is still carried out on the belief that one has been given or will be given real coins. Other- wise, fake coins in and of themselves have no utility for any trans- action, just as hundreds of blind men combined together have no capacity to see. o blog as dissingcost od bib woHala

But in all this blind succession, if there is just one person with sight who started the chain, then it is possible.

Just as among all these people, it is only the person with sight who makes such a successful dealing possible, similarly, only if there is a real coin to begin with can such dealings be exe- cuted successfully. And there too, it is only the true coin that makes it possible to pass the counterfeit for a real one, since one engages in such dealings in the quest for real coins, just as the person having sight was at the origin of the chain, setting it into motion. Therefore, when it is ascertained that there is some genuine coin, whose authenticity experts in such dealings can verify by examination, then that [genuine coin] alone is the real object that is being superimposed onto the fake one. In the same way that the coin is [established as] real by the test of prac- tical utility, so too the universe, which is being indicated by the

(vijñāna). According to them, external objects do not exist; only object-cognitions exist, which are due to the revival of sublimi- nal impressions (vāsanās) imprinted in the mind. In sutra 2.2.30, Śankarācārya dismisses vāsanās as the cause of external objects. He interprets the sutra to mean that vāsanās cannot exist in the Yogācāra view because they deny the reality of objects on which the vāsanās are based. Väsanäs are produced by external objects.
To this, the Vijñānavādī may reply that the flow of vāsanās is beginningless, therefore there is no need of real external objects. The vāsanās are created by the illusory objects of the previous cycle of creation or previous birth. These vasanas produce objects that give rise to further väsanās. This is refuted by Sankarācārya in the part of the commentary cited here by Jiva Gosvāmi. Śankara says that just as in a beginningless blind succession, there is no possi- bility of valid knowledge, in the same way, unless there is some real object to begin with, there cannot be a flow of vāsanās. Śrī Jīva elaborates this with an example of gold purchased by a blind man.
In Bhamati Vācaspati Miśra adds that vāsanās also need a sta- ble base, which is not accepted by the Vijñānavādīs. If the alaya- vijñāna (the collective receptacle consciousness, or the cosmic storehouse of the dispositions of all past experiences and actions) is proposed as the support of vasanās, then Vacaspati counters by pointing out that even the alaya is not stable but temporary. Alaya and väsană are both momentary, therefore they cannot have a relation of support and supported (adhara-adheya-sambandha). They come into existence simultaneously like the two horns of a cow which grow simultaneously, and thus they cannot have the relation of support and supported.
Here it should be noted that the refutation that Sankara gives to Vijñānavāda is also applicable to his own doctrine. He proposes that the world is illusory, a superimposition of samskāras onto Brah- man. Saṁskāras from a previous cycle give rise to the present world. But if the world is illusory, then how can one have saṁskā- ras? He says that the cycle of creation and dissolution is beginning- less. Therefore, the experience from the previous cycle is super- imposed onto Brahman to give rise to the present universe, which
478
70 Pariņāma-vāda
does not really exist. Therefore, Sankara claims there is no need to have a real basis for beginning a succession of illusion. This expla- nation is refuted here by Śrī Jiva. He says that without any real basis, it is not possible to propagate an illusion. No honest person deals in fake coins knowingly. Practical dealings (vyavahāra) are always based in reality. aixson bibenlos 1891 31
This refutes not only Sankara&rsquo;s vivarta-vāda but also the Bud- dhist school of philosophy called Vijñānavāda. According to Vijñā- navāda, all the substances of the world as well as their qualities are imaginary constructs of the ignorant mind. We construct the exter- nal world ourselves and then become deluded that it exists by itself. All our phenomenal knowledge is without any truth and is a cre- ation of vāsanās, or subliminal impressions, like a dream. There is a beginningless proclivity to believe in and create a phenome- nal world of appearance. It is only due to vāsanās that phenom- ena appear in the twofold aspect of subject and object. No external object exists in reality. Everything is consciousness.
According to the Lankavatara-sutra, consciousness alone is real. The external world is a projection of the collective recep- tacle consciousness (alaya-vijñāna) and not of the individual or evolving consciousness (pravṛtti-vijñāna). The force behind cre- ation is the beginningless tendency in the alaya, inspired by ignorance, to manifest itself as subject and object (anadi-vāsanā). The locus (āśraya) and the object (visaya) of this tendency is the alaya itself. Creation, therefore, is the result of this beginning- less tendency inspired by ignorance, which leads to plurality (anadi-kāla-prapañca-dauḥṣṭhülya-vāsanā).
Individual pravṛtti-vijñānas are manifestations of the store- house consciousness (alaya-vijñāna). They are neither identical with nor different from the alaya. The alaya-vijñāna is like an ocean and the pravṛtti-vijñānas are like its waves. Ultimately, there is not the slightest difference between the individual vijñānas and the alaya. The alaya is indescribable and transcends all categories of the intellect. It is neither affirmation nor negation nor both nor neither. It is to be directly realized (nirbhasa-gocara). It is neither momentary nor permanent. But from the phenomenal
479III The Ontology of Maya - Bahiranga-sakti
point of view, it must be described as eternal, immortal, and the permanent background of all momentary phenomena. bismil
This theory (vijñāna-vāda) is naturally refuted by the Śrutis in this verse, because if there is no real object to begin with, how can illusion be propagated? Illusion is also based on the real exis- tence of objects. If real coins did not exist in the first place, there could never be fake coins. If there were no person endowed with vision who could verify the authenticity of a golden ornament, even millions of blind men together could not do so. d), abjivin
In the next anuccheda, by referring to the prayers of the Vedas personified, Śrī Jiva continues to explain that the universe is existent even during the period of dissolution.

THEREFORE, unlike the silver in an oyster shell, the universe is not non-existent when in [such] an unmanifested state [within Paramātmā]. According to the logic of Brahma-sutra, &ldquo;As a piece of cloth is not different from its threads [so the effect is not different from its cause]&rdquo; (paṭavac ca, vs 2.1.19), firstly, the universe in its subtle state remains unmanifested; secondly, even though it appears to be in the same class as illusory silver because of being observable like it, it has a different type of existence; and thirdly, because it is not devoid of transforma- tion like the ātmā, its existence is not single and unchanging. In order to establish this meaning, the Śrutis speak the next verse:

pol If this [world] did not exist before, then it would not have come the into existence [at all]; therefore, the inference is falsely drawn from the [world&rsquo;s] dissolution that it is a mere appearance in You, who are &ldquo;of one taste&rdquo; (eka-rasa), and that it is present to awareness only in the interim period [between creation and dissolution]. Therefore, we compare it to the various types of phenomenal objects derived from their elemental source mate- rials. Only those who have not yet awakened discrimination (a- vibudhaḥ) believe that [this] false play of the mind is the reality.

The word yat here should be taken to mean &ldquo;if&rdquo; (yadi); the pro- noun &ldquo;this&rdquo; (idam) refers to the world; &ldquo;before&rdquo; (agre) means prior to the creation. So, if this world did not exist before the creation, then it would not have come into existence, in the way of a sky-flower (ākāśa-kusuma)? The lack of [the augment] a- (in bhavisyat)3 is an archaic (ārṣa) usage.*

3 The word bhaviṣyat taken alone is a future participle of the root √bhu in the ar
nominative singular, &ldquo;[that which] is to become.&rdquo; Jiva Gosvāmi, however, citing ārşa usage, takes the word as abhavisyat, with elision of the prefixed augment 10&quot;a.&rdquo; This gives us instead the conditional perfect in the third person singular,
&ldquo;[he, she, or it] would have been.&rdquo; Śrīdhara Svāmī here reads the former option (bhavisyat), which together with the negative particle yields the sense, &ldquo;will not be.&rdquo; Taking Śrīdhara&rsquo;s reading, the translation of the first two lines would be, &ldquo;Since this [phenomenal world] did not exist in the beginning [i.e., before creation] nor will it persist after dissolution, hence it is concluded that during the intervening period [too] it falsely appears in You, the absolute Existence.&rdquo; In this case, we have translated the verse in accordance with Śrī Jīva Gosvāmi&rsquo;s interpretation.

forms, attributing them to the Vedic language, which is full of such
irregularities or non-classical forms.

The Śrutis also say that [this material world] certainly existed [prior to the creation], for example: &ldquo;My dear, prior to the cre- ation, this world was present as existence alone&rdquo; (CHU 6.2.1), and, &ldquo;Indeed, the universe existed as [one with] the Self prior to the creation&rdquo; (BAU 1.4.1).

In this way, this universe, which in its causal state is situated in a subtle [i.e., potential] form as one with You [Paramātmā], later expands into the [visible, created] world when present in the state of being an effect. Thus, only because of the dissolution (nidhana), i.e., due only to the fact of the world&rsquo;s destruction, is it inferred that this [universal creation] is a mere appearance in You, like silver in an oyster shell, present to awareness only during the interim period of the manifest creation, but without existence before or after. This inference is false (mṛṣa); it is not substantiated by any means of valid knowing (pramāna).

Commentary
Ile as bus nt re
ŚRĪ JIVA GOSVĀMI FURTHER REFERS to the prayers of the Vedas per- sonified to establish that the universe is not imaginary like the sil- ver seen in an oyster shell, nor is it real like Paramātmā, who does not undergo any modifications. This verse is specifically cited to establish the principle of sat-karya-vāda.
The basic principle of sat-karya-vada is that the effect exists in the cause in a subtle or potential form. Therefore, the Vedas say that if the universe did not exist (in potentia) prior to its manifes- tation, then it could never at all be brought forth into actuality. Nothing can come out of nothing, nor can a specific effect arise from any cause whatsoever. Specific effects are produced from spe- cific causes. In other words, during the period of dissolution, the universe was enfolded in Paramātmā in an unmanifest state.
Bilidia
According to sat-karya-vāda, nothing new is ever created. Everything exists all the time in either an unmanifest or a mani- fest state. Modern science also agrees that energy can neither be created nor destroyed, but can only be transformed from one state to another. Science also accepts that matter and energy are interchangeable.
There is a principle that what is not present in the beginning nor at the end is also not present in the interim (ādāv ante ca yan nästi vartamāne&rsquo;pi tat tatha). Because the universe is not eternal it did not exist before its creation and it will be destroyed after some time its present existence is thereby also disproved by this prin- ciple. But then why do we perceive it? The vivarta-vādī replies that it is superimposed onto Brahman like the illusion of silver on an oyster shell.

<p>The Vedas personified refute this by saying mṛṣā, meaning, &ldquo;this inference is false.&rdquo; Why? &ldquo;Because You are of one-taste (eka-rase),&rdquo; implying that if one once intuits Brahman, there is no possibility of any other object - as a separate independent entity - becoming apparent to consciousness. Rather, everywhere and at all times, it is Brahman alone that is seen in and as all things. In this state of awareness, superimposition of the universe onto Brahman and the consequent illusion that the world is real become impossible. Moreover, it is not true that the universe did not exist prior to its manifestation or that it shall cease to exist after its dissolution. It exists even then in its subtle or potential form, enfolded within prakṛti. Therefore, it is concluded that the potency (śakti) of Param- ātmā undergoes modification by His inconceivable will, without any corresponding alteration to His own intrinsic nature (svarupa), and that He brings forth the universe from its unmanifest state.
Those who consider the world imaginary are of undiscriminat- ing intellect (abudha), as are those who take this universe itself to be the ultimate reality. The reason for this is that there is no pos- sibility of Brahman becoming the substratum of superimposition, because Brahman is qualityless. Nothing can be superimposed onto a qualityless object. Moreover, if the Advaitavada view of Real- ity is accepted, who will do the superimposing? There is nothing other than Brahman.

Consequently, an object like a pot [before it is produced] is nei- ther existent in manifest form nor completely non-existent, but exists in the clay itself in an unmanifested state. Just as it becomes manifest through the combined potency of the agent along with the actions performed by him, so too the universe situated in You, the Supreme Cause, becomes manifest by the combination of Your intrinsic potency together with the actions effected through such agency.

Commentary
Śrī Jiva further explains the intention of sat-karya-väda to establish the reality of the universe. A potter produces a pot from clay by performing some actions on it. The question raised is whether the pot existed or not before it was produced by the potter. If the first option is accepted, i.e., the pot pre-existed, then the question nat- urally follows: What did the potter do? Obviously nothing, since the pot was already existing. His action would be meaningless, like trying to make paste out of paste by grinding it even further. од The only other possibility is that the pot was non-existent to begin with. In such a case, there could not be any relation of the potter or of his actions to the pot, just as one cannot grasp a sky- flower, i.e., an imaginary flower growing in the sky. For a relation to exist between two things, they must both be real.
There is a relationship between a cause and its effect. Only spe- cific causes produce specific effects. But if the pot did not exist beforehand, then how could the clay used in making it ever be related to the pot? For a relation to be possible, both relata must exist simultaneously. In the same way, the potter and his actions

71 Manifest and Unmanifest States of the Universe
are also causal factors in producing the pot, but if the pot is non- existent, then how can these two causes be related to it or desig- nated as its causes? There can never be any relation between a non-existent object and existent objects, actions, or qualities.
To produce something means to have a relation with its exis- tence. A non-existent entity can never become existent because it can never be related to anything. Therefore, since no other possi- ble conclusion is left to us, we must accept that the effect exists in unmanifest or potential form in the cause and is simply made mani- fest by the action of the agent. It is thus concluded that the efforts of an agent to bring forth effects are not futile and that an effect cannot be absolutely non-existent prior to its production.
Śrī Jiva points out that the theory of Advaitavada, or vivarta- vāda, i.e., that the universe is not real but a superimposition by the ignorant jiva on Brahman, is tantamount to atheism, aniśvara-vāda, and thus contrary to Vedanta.
Advaitavādīs accept that the mind is a product of the gross elements (mahābhūtas):
Then, through the intentionality of Iśvara, the five elements in their uncombined state, also called tan-matras, are generated.
These elements, being products of maya consisting of the three Ygunas, are also made of the three gunas - sattva, rajas, and tamas.
T
Out of these, the five elements predominated by sattva-guna give wh rise to the five cognitive senses, namely, ear, skin, eyes, tongue, hand nose, respectively. But from the elements, beginning with
space (ākāśa), that are mixed with a portion of sattva, are gener- ated mind, intellect, ego, and citta. (Vedānta-paribhāṣā 7.10, 12)11
But the same philosophers claim that the universe consisting of the mahābhūtas and its products, such as mind and ego, is a construct of the mind:ond at 1 Jedd (in)

This is utterly illogical. The mind is a product of the material elements, yet, out of ignorance, the mind constructs the universe, from which it itself is produced. This explanation has the defect of mutual dependence, anyo&rsquo;nyaśraya-dosa.

Moreover, whose ignorance is being spoken of? Since Brahman is the only reality, it is Brahman that is both the subject and object of ignorance. But this is absurd. Because Brahman is universally accepted as being pure knowledge in essence (jñāna-svarupa), how can It become the subject of ignorance?

The adjective &ldquo;untrue&rdquo; (asatya) means &ldquo;false&rdquo; or &ldquo;illusory,&rdquo; since the world cannot be described as real or unreal. That the world is without foundation (apratistha) means that it is with- out any purpose. Because the notion of God superimposed on Brahman is a mere conceptual construct manufactured out of ignorance, like mistaking a post for a man, there is no such per- son in the world identifiable as God. Hence, the world is devoid of God (aniśvara). That the world is brought forth &ldquo;perpetually&rdquo; (aparaspara-sambhuta) means that it arises out of a beginning- less succession of ignorance. The word aparaspara signifies the continuity of an action. Therefore, [the world] is born merely out of desire (kama-haituka), or in other words, out of mental resolve (manaḥ-sankalpa). The meaning is that it is like a dream object.

In the same section of the Gita, the impure samskāras [of the ungodly nature] are described [in the prior verse]: &ldquo;People of ungodly nature do not know what is appropriate action and what is to be avoided. Thus, in them there exists neither purity, nor virtuous conduct, nor truthfulness&rdquo; (GITA 16.7).15 And then, in the following verse, their actions (gati) are also criticized: &ldquo;Upholding this view, such hostile individuals, who are bereft of self-awareness, of paltry discrimination, and performers of cruel deeds, take birth solely for the destruction of the world&rdquo; (GĪTĀ 16.9).16

Commentary
Next, Śrī Jiva shows that the position of the Kevaladvaita School (i.e., radical nondualism) is not accepted by the scriptures. In fact, it has been criticized vehemently. The scriptures do not propound the world as imaginary, but as the real effect of Paramātmā&rsquo;s real potency (prakṛti or mayā). The maya of Advaitavada, however, is neither real nor unreal and is thus called anirvacaniya, or ineffa- ble. In his Bhāṣya on Brahma-sutra (2.1.14), Śrī Śankara clearly says that māyā is the energy of Iśvara, but is avidya-kalpita, or imagined through ignorance. While expounding on this part of Sankara&rsquo;s commentary, Śrī Vācaspati Miśra makes it even more explicit: &ldquo;This is to be said: The majesty and omniscience of Isvara are not real, but only an imposition out of ignorance.&rsquo; TarOn
On the one hand, it is said that maya is an energy of the omni-
māyā māyā scient God, while on the other it is said to be neither real nor unreal. But according to Sankara, neither Iśvara Himself nor His potencies are real. Śrī Śankarācārya states this in his commentary on the same sutra: &ldquo;Thus, Iśvara&rsquo;s rulership, omniscience, and omnipo- tence are contingent solely on the limiting adjuncts (upadhis) that are a product of ignorance; they are without ontological reality.&rdquo;
nergy
&ldquo;19
&ldquo;20
Thus, māya&rsquo;s creation, the universe, is also not real. Everything is avidya-kalpita, or a product of ignorance. Whose ignorance? It is the ignorance of the jiva. But the jiva himself is not real. He is also a product of ignorance. Both Iśvara and the jiva are the offspring of ignorance, or māyā. But ignorance is in the jiva. So it is difficult to determine which comes first, the jiva or māyā.
Māyā is the cause of Isvara, and at the same time, Iśvara is the support of maya. The universe is a conceptual construct of the jiva&rsquo;s mind, but the jiva&rsquo;s mind is a product of the universe. Although the jīva, māyā, and the universe are explained as having a cause and
effect relation, they are also said to be mutually dependent.

III The Ontology of Maya - Bahiranga-sakti
But māyā as described in the scriptures is a real potency of Paramātmā. In Bhagavad Gita, Śrī Kṛṣṇa says that māyā, consist- ing of the three gunas, is His potency (7.4, 7.14, 14.3). In the Bhāga- vata Purana verse (11.11.3) cited here also, Śrī Kṛṣṇa says that māyā, consisting of the vidya and avidya potencies, belongs to Him.
Advaitavada, being based on the concept of anirvacaniya-māyā, is popularly called Māyāvāda. In the scriptures it has been counted as a paṣaṇḍa, or heretical doctrine. Next, Śrī Jiva cites verses to this effect.

III The Ontology of Maya - Bahiranga-sakti
All the works referred to in this verse are philosophical trea- tises only and not canonical Vedic texts, and only the [authors&rsquo;] names have been stated directly, thus they are not to be inter- preted otherwise [i.e., as independently authoritative texts or as texts in harmony with devotion]. The conclusions of the author of the Brahma-sutra, as expressed in aphorisms like, &ldquo;Brahman is full of bliss, because it has been affirmed repeat- edly in the Śrutis&rdquo; (ananda-mayo&rsquo;bhyasat, vs 1.1.12), have been corrupted in these philosophies. Therefore, whenever some praise is given to them, it is only because they partially establish theism by defeating stark atheism. (vor-dorry abgan-010370 तस्मात् स्वतन्त्र ईश्वर एव सर्वस्रष्टा न तु जीवः स्वाज्ञानेन स्वशक्त्यैवेत्यायातम् । तदुक्तं श्रीबादरायणेनापि बहुत्र &ldquo;सञ्ज्ञामूर्तिकृप्तिस्तु त्रिवृत् कुर्वत उपदेशात्” (ब्र० सू० २।४।२०) इत्यादिषु ।

Thus, Iśvara alone is the independent creator of everything and not the jiva, neither through its own ignorance or any potency belonging to it. Śrī Bādarāyaṇa has also stated this in many places, such as, &ldquo;The evolution of names and forms, however, is the work of the Supreme Divinity, who compounds the ele- ments through triplication (trivṛt kurvatah), because it has been so instructed in the scriptures&rdquo; (vs 2.4.20).24

Therefore, it is concluded that the universe is indeed real.

nature of darkness, inertia, and unconsciousness). Śiva responds by first explaining that the Pasupata doctrine (a sect of Saivism) and the six darśanas are all tāmasika. He then goes on to say that in Kaliyuga, he takes the form of a brāhmaṇa (Sankarācārya) and propagates Advaitavada. After this, he states the three divisions of the Purānas according to the three gunas. winds asged
There is a similar dialogue in Chapter 71 of the same book wherein Śiva recounts how he was ordered by Visņu to propagate the illusory philosophy of Advaitavada. Thus, on the order of Bha- gavān Viṣṇu, Śiva himself appeared as Sankarācārya and taught Advaitavada. It is clear from these references that Māyāvāda, or Advaitavada, is not the philosophy of the Vedas or the Vedic scriptures. fe ter atmammoo Imavao svile jini sasomi bstSimilarly, the philosophies of Patanjali, Kanāda, Gautama, and Kapila are also not supported by the revealed and authoritative texts of the Vedas or mantra-granthas. None of these philosophies accept that Bhagavan is both the nimitta and upādāna cause of the universe and that He is sat-cit-ananda by nature. The Brahma-sūtra (1.1.12) very clearly states that the Absolute Reality, or Brahman, is ananda-maya, or bliss personified. Even so, these other philoso- phies are sometimes praised because they are instrumental in countering atheism. They can be likened to a fence that protects the Vedic creeper.it blow tolli as 20maco QUB Śrī Jiva refers to Brahma-sutra (2.4.20) to establish that the uni- verse is created by Iśvara and not by the jiva through ignorance. He raises a doubt by citing an Upanisadic statement asserting that the mind created prajapati, meaning Brahma and the progenitor gods. Śrī Jiva answers that mind here refers to the presiding deity of the mind, Śrī Aniruddha. Alternatively, the word &ldquo;mind&rdquo; can be taken here to mean the intentionality of Paramātmā, as mentioned in the Chandogya Upanisad (6.2.3).

Paramātmā has real inconceivable power. This was established in Bhagavat Sandarbha, Anuccheda 16.2. There is no need for Him to create an illusory māyā. He is real; His powers are real, and His creation is also real. This is stated by the devas headed by Brahma in their prayers (garbha-stuti) to Śrī Kṛṣṇa..sable as

theThe gods had earlier petitioned Bhagavan to request His help in ridding the Earth of her burden of demonic people. Bhagavan had answered by promising that He would quickly descend to the Earth. Now, as Kṛṣṇa was about to appear from the womb of Devaki, they were pleased that He was fulfilling His promise. Therefore, they began their prayers with the word satya-vrata, or &ldquo;one who is true to His word.&rdquo; The whole verse follows with a litany of ways in which Kṛṣṇa is satya, or truth.abzo aswad wod
In the first three adjectival compounds, it is stated that He has true resolve, is devoted to truth, and that His three types of lilă in the form of creation, sustenance, and dissolution are all true. Fur- thermore, it is said that He is the source of the cosmos and also immanent in it. Śrī Jīva Gosvāmī comments that after declaring the first three notions as true, to then claim that the world created by Him is imaginary and that He enters such an imaginary world would break the natural sequence of the prayer in which they are establishing everything as satya, or true.
Śrī Jiva Prabhu calls this ardha-jaratiya-nyaya, the principle of &ldquo;half an elder woman,&rsquo; &ldquo;29
which has roughly the same meaning as the ardha-kukkuți-nyaya, or the principle of &ldquo;half a hen,&rdquo; i.e., indi- cating the impossibility of an argument on the basis of an inner con- tradiction. Here it would mean accepting Brahman as real but the cosmos as illusory. Such an acceptance would furthermore not suit the frame of mind of the devas, because to say that God creates an imaginary world is no praise. The devas use the word satya repeat- edly to substantiate that everything regarding Bhagavan, or even simply related to Him, is real. Therefore, it must be concluded that the cosmos is real.

IN THIS WAY, according to SB 10.87.37 (Anuccheda 71.1), the total dissolution (prākṛta-laya) is included in the doctrine called sat- kārya-vāda. But in the ultimate dissolution (atyantika-laya) characterized as liberation, the material elements, such as earth, are not destroyed! It is illogical that these elements, which are [real] products of the inherent potency of Paramātmā, could be destroyed by a jiva and, moreover, merely by ideation (bhāvanā) [as per the process of liberation described in Advaita- vāda]. This is understood from scriptural evidence confirming that the portions of the gross elements that formed the bodies of those who attained liberation, such as King Parikṣit, contin- ued to exist [even after their awakening to the liberated state].
1 The four kinds of dissolution will be explained in the commentary below. They are also described in the Bhagavatam passages (SB 12.4) that are to be discussed in the following sections. For naimittika-pralaya, see SB 12.4.4; for präkṛta-laya, SB 12.4.22 ff.; for atyantika-laya, SB 12.4.34; and for nitya-laya, SB 12.4.35. It should be noted that Śrīdhara Svāmī takes the Advaitavada position against which Śrī Jiva is arguing at the beginning of his commentary to SB 12.4.23: atyantika-layo mokṣaḥ sa ca brahma-jñānena sarva-prapañca-layātmakaḥ.

72 The Universe Is Not Destroyed in Atyantika-laya
Additionally, the subtle elements, such as the intellect, which are a part of Hiranyagarbha, will also continue to exist. There- fore, it is the abandonment of the misidentification with [the gross and subtle bodies] alone that is called ultimate dissolution (atyantika-laya).

Thus, even in the following verses, it is only the relation with the material adjunct (upadhi) that is being given up; the material adjunct itself is not being established as illusory:

The same is true in the section beginning with buddhi and indriya [sB 12.4.23-34, Anucchedas 72-84]. There, Sri Suka argues that the intellect, senses, and so on, are produced from the inher- ent potency of Paramātmā, because He is their substratum, their illuminator, and that without which their existence would be impossible:

Consciousness alone shines forth in the form of the intellect, the senses, and their objects, being their substratum. [This is ] because they can be perceived [by it] and cannot exist indepen- dently [of it]. Whatever has a beginning and an end is unreal. (SB 12.4.23)*

The consciousness characterized as Paramātmā alone shines forth in the form of the objects of the internal and external senses. This means that the objects, such as the intellect, are not separate from Him, because that consciousness forms their sub- stratum (tad-āśraya). The neuter gender [in the word āśraya, or “shelter,” which is an adjective of Paramātmā,] is an archaic usage. Yet there remains an absolute distinction between them [between the senses, etc., and their conscious substratum in the form of Paramātmā], just like [that which exists] between a king and his servant.

[Sukadeva] gives two further reasons for making this [distinc- tion]: They [the internal senses, etc.] can be perceived (drsya- tva), meaning that they must be revealed or illuminated by Paramātmā, and [secondly] because they cannot exist indepen- dently (avyatireka), meaning that without His existence, they have no existence. Therefore, the intent is the same as in the verse, &ldquo;Just as the light of a fire situated in one place is diffused all around, so does the energy of the Supreme Brahman pervade this whole universe&rdquo; (VP 1.22.55). In other words, the intellect and so on are to be established as His natural potencies alone.

But that which has a beginning and an end (ady-antavat), [such as] silver, the genuineness of which is established in the market- place, etc., is not real when on occasion it is superimposed onto oyster shells or some other object. That is, it is not a real sub- stance like the oyster shell, since the oyster shell is not its sub- stratum and illuminator, nor is it indispensable for its existence. The meaning is that [the perceived silver] is not something dif- ferent from the oyster shell. [If the universe were not real or not the energy of Paramātmā,] then it would violate the prin- ciple that by knowing the Absolute Reality everything becomes known? The same argument is applicable in the case of the other doctrine called asat-karya-vāda.

Commentary blam
[avebnine] odr [aois
IN ANUCCHEDAS 72-84, Śrī Jiva Gosvāmi will discuss a series of verses from SB 12.4, in which the four kinds of dissolution are described. His purpose is to show that liberation, or ultimate dissolution (atyantika-laya), does not result in the destruction of the universe, as some theorists propose (as mentioned in the first footnote in this section in regard to Sridhara Svami).bove th
According to Advaitavada, the universe is a superimposition on Brahman out of ignorance, or avidya. Thus, logically, when a per- son becomes Brahman-realized and his avidya is dispelled, the uni- verse should also come to an end. The fundamental principle is that by the realization of an illusion&rsquo;s substratum, the illusion itself will come to an end. When a person mistakes a rope for a snake, the snake is a product of his ignorance about the rope. The rope is the substratum onto which the snake, a product of avidya, is superim- posed. When light is thrown onto the apparent snake, the bewil- dered person sees that there is nothing there but a rope. His igno- rance about the rope is then dispelled, and, as a result, the product of ignorance, the snake, immediately disappears. allade ustavo
Jon
Similarly, when one realizes Brahman, his ignorance about Brahman is removed. As a consequence, the product of his igno- rance, the universe, should also disappear. This means that his physical body, which is made from the illusory material elements, should also cease to exist. But this does not happen. The reason for this is that the universe is not the imagination of any jiva, but the real creation of Paramātmā, and is thus not brought to an end by any jiva&rsquo;s enlightenment.
In reply to this, Advaitavada claims that the body of a Brahman- realized person does not dissolve because of his prārabdha-karma. The brahma-jñāna destroys only the accumulated karma, but not the prärabdha. This also does not make sense because there have
&ldquo;tasya tavad eva ciram yavan na vimokṣye&rsquo;tha sampatsya iti&rdquo; [CHU 6.14.2] ity-adi-śrutya &ldquo;nābhuktam kṣiyate karma&rdquo; ity-adi-smṛtyä 10 u organoson cotpadita-karya-karma-vyatiriktānāṁ sañcita-karmaṇām eva mor jñāna-vinäśitvävagamat&hellip; apratibaddha-jñänasyaiväjñāna-vitarkataya

been jñānīs, like Suka and Vamadeva, who were Brahman-realized from their very birth. They did not have prärabdha-karma to begin with, and yet they had bodies and experienced the objects of the world. Therefore, Śrī Jiva Gosvāmi concludes that the only atyantika-laya, or ultimate dissolution (i.e., mukti), is of ignorance and not of the universe itself.
The Advaitavadīs accept the four types of pralaya, or dissolu- tion, described in the Puranas&rsquo; and Vedanta, namely: nitya (con- stant), prākṛta (total), naimittika (occasional), and atyantika (ulti- mate). Constant dissolution (nitya-laya) refers to the self&rsquo;s daily dissociation from gross and subtle forms occurring in deep dream- less sleep. Total dissolution (präkṛta-laya) occurs when Hiranya- garbha, or Brahma, dies at the end of his life span and the whole cosmos is dissolved. Occasional dissolution (naimittika-laya) takes place at the end of Hiranyagarbha&rsquo;s day when the lower planets up to Svarloka are destroyed. Ultimate dissolution (atyantika-laya) transpires when a person becomes liberated through Brahman- realization or by becoming free of avidya, the very root cause of the universe.10
This fourth type of pralaya is compared to the removal of dark- ness by light. As soon as a lamp is lit, darkness is dispelled. There is no delay. Similarly, for the realized self (ātmā), Brahman- realization and the disappearance of the universe should occur simultaneously.

III The Ontology of Maya - Bahiranga-sakti
In response to this view, Śrī Jiva first refers to Sukadeva&rsquo;s final words to King Parikṣit. These verses, when taken at face value, seem at first to confirm the view of Advaitavada. The human body is compared to a clay pot and Brahman to all-pervading space. Although there is no difference between the space enclosed within a clay pot and that outside it, space being both one and indivisi- ble, we still use expressions such as, &ldquo;the space in the pot&rdquo; and &ldquo;the space outside the pot.&rdquo; But once we break the pot, such an imagined division disappears.
whiteloris (late) dipang
Advaitavadīs frequently cite this example to explain the one- ness of the jiva and Brahman. Becoming liberated is like breaking the pot, which is compared to the body. One then attains Brahman and no longer sees the body and the universe as different from the ātmā, or self (jivo brahma sampadyate punaḥ, SB 12.5.5).bahoriso
If, however, one examines these verses carefully, it can be evi- denced that they do not actually advocate Advaitavada. The jīva does not become Brahman, but attains (sampadyate) Brahman. The word sampadyate is derived from the root √pad (gatau, &ldquo;to go&rdquo;) with the prefix sam, and the sense is of obtaining, as in accumulating wealth, or as in meeting or becoming united with something. In this regard, the distinction of the obtainer and the obtained, or of subject and object, is retained, even in unity with Brahman.
Moreover, in verse SB 12.5.12, Śukadeva said that on realizing his true identity, Parikṣit would not perceive his body or the uni- verse as different from Paramātmā because both are rooted in Him. Śuka did not say that Parikṣit would not see them at all, as would be the case if they were nothing but the illusory product of his igno- rance. Rather, it means that on liberation, he would understand that his body as well as the universe are not independent of Param- ātmā. The verse does not state that he would realize that they are completely imaginary.
With this preamble, Śrī Jīva Prabhu furthers his argument by turning to a series of verses from the previous chapter of the Twelfth Canto, where the different kinds of dissolution are discussed. The first of these is cited as the main verse in this
anuccheda.
508
72 The Universe Is Not Destroyed in Atyantika-laya
arl The word avastu in this verse refers to illusory objects, such as silver misperceived in an oyster shell. An illusory object has no fac- tual existence prior to the occurrence of the illusion, nor does the illusory object disappear in any real sense when the illusion is dissi- pated. Such illusory objects have a beginning and an end and thus cannot be called real even while they are being experienced.sms
Śri Jiva reasons further that if the universe were accepted as illusory, like the silver seen in an oyster shell, then the principle stated in the Chandogya Upanisad, namely, that by knowing Brah- man everything becomes known, would be violated.&rdquo; The essence of this principle is that by knowing the real source, all real evo- lutes generated out of that source also come to be known. By know- ing the constituent cause, one can also know the characteristics of its effects. If the evolutes were all false, however, there would be nothing else to be known as a result of knowing their source. Consequently, a real evolute is known only from its real source.tod
It is not possible to know real silver through knowledge of an oyster shell. This is why Śrī Jiva says that real silver is recognized or identified in the marketplace by experts in precious metals, not from studying the false or illusory silver that has been misper- ceived in the oyster shell. Following this logic, if the universe were illusory, then it would not be knowable as a consequence of the knowledge of Brahman, its source. Furthermore, it could not be nondifferent from Brahman, its real source, as silver is not nondif- ferent from an oyster shell.
It is interesting to note here that Advaitavādīs offer this very reasoning to prove that the universe is illusory. They say that the principle of &ldquo;If Brahman is known, everything is known,&rdquo; can be upheld only if the universe is nondifferent from Brahman12 But rm (or color) are all parts of the great &ldquo;yatha somyaikena mṛt-pindena sarvam mṛn-mayaṁ vijñātaṁ syād from it.

509III The Ontology of Maya - Bahiranga-sakti
Śrī Jiva argues that if the world were an imaginary product of the jiva&rsquo;s ignorance, then it could not be nondifferent from Brahman, because in such a case the universe would neither be rooted in Brah- man, nor illuminated by Brahman, nor could it be a modification of Brahman&rsquo;s potency. If, however, the universe is understood as a manifestation of Brahman&rsquo;s potency, then it can be considered as nondifferent from Brahman through the principle of identity of energy and its energetic source (sakti-śaktimator abhedatvam), as confirmed in Śruti statements such as, &ldquo;Indeed all this [universe] is Brahman&rdquo; (CHU 3.14.1).local
This reasoning also refutes the philosophy of asat-karya-vāda propounded by the Naiyayikas. The theory of sat-kārya-vāda, which maintains that the effect pre-exists in its material cause prior to its production, has three principal opponents, namely, Vijñānavāda (subjective idealism, i.e., external objects are unreal, being no more than ideas in the mind), vivarta-vāda (the effect is unreal, a mere appearance of Brahman), and asat-kārya-vāda (i.e., the effect is non-existent in its cause prior to its origination). When the first two are refuted, so too is the third. In contrast to Vijñānavāda and vivarta-vāda, wherein the effect is unreal, asat- kārya-vāda says that the effect, although real, does not exist in the cause. The arguments against this have already been given above (Anucchedas 60-66).

AFTER EXPLAINING that the universe is ananya, or nondifferent from Paramātmā, and is yet not exactly one with Him, Śrī Suka now provides an example to make it clear. A flame, the visual sense, and the forms or colors that are perceived by the eye are all manifesta- tions of the mahabhuta called fire (in this verse, jyoti, or light). This is understood from Sankhya, which holds that the subtle aspect (tan-matra) of the fire element gives rise to the gross fire element and to form or color (rupa), which is an attribute of fire. The eye or sense of sight is also a product of the fire element. Thus, they are not different from fire, which is their source.
Similarly, the material elements are not different from Param- ātmā, their source. Yet, Paramātmā is distinct from them and is not implicated in their defects, limitations, or modifications, just as the universal elemental fire is not itself influenced by any changes in a flame, the eye, or its form.need hellotul adi yatimiz anit instalih vlassiqmony) al dades mont bajaib (2.5.188).msrit mont

IN THIS WAY, Śukadeva refers to the intellect and so on as prod- ucts of the inherent potency of Paramātmā. In spite of this, how- ever, he describes them as flawed, as understood from the allu- sion to their impurity. This is due to the fact that Paramātmā is completely different (anyatama) from them, since they are com- posed of the extrinsic (bahiranga) potency, whereas He is qual- ified by the intrinsic (antaranga) and intermediary (taṭastha) potencies [as well]. Having asserted these points, Suka next describes the pure jiva&rsquo;s act of superimposition [of its own iden- tity] - along with its cause - onto the three states of the intel- lect [namely, wakefulness, dreaming, and deep sleep]. This he does in order to induce the jiva to give up its identification with the intellect and so on:

THERE are three states of buddhi, known as wakefulness, dreaming, and deep sleep. He who experiences these three states and presides over them is the individual self (cf. SB 7.7.25)? These three states of buddhi are three upadhis of the pure self, according to which the self is assigned three designations, namely, viśva, taijasa, and prājña, respectively (cf. Mandukya Upanisad 3-5). 10 oud
In the waking state, the jiva is aware of the gross body, and it quits one gross body to enter another without giving up the subtle body. Therefore, the jiva in waking state consciousness is called viśva (from √viś praveśane, &ldquo;to enter&rdquo;). Alternatively, it is called viśva because it is a witness to the viśva, or the external world.ti *<em>When the jiva identifies with the subtle body, it is called taijasa, either because the subtle body is made up of the taijasa (fire) ele- ment, or because it is a witness to dreams, which are also said to be a product of tejas (taijasa-padartha). When the jiva identifies with avidya, it is called prajña (pra-ajña) because in this state it per- ceives nothing and remains as pure consciousness. Dhi (the intel- lect) and its three states are products of maya, and the pure self is independent of them.

74 The Jiva Is Distinct from the Three States of Buddhi
Śrī Jiva here refers to this verse to explain that the adhyāsa (superimposition) in the three states of buddhi belongs to the jiva, and not to Brahman, as understood by the Advaitavādīs. Accord- ing to them, the jiva devoid of these three states is the pure Param- ātmā or Brahman: &ldquo;The jiva who is identified with gross, subtle, and causal avidya during the waking state is called viśva; the same jīva while identifying with subtle and causal avidya during the dream state is called taijasa; the very same jiva while identifying with causal avidyă during deep sleep is called prajña. The same jiva when devoid of identification with these three manifestations of avidya becomes the pure Paramātmā.&rdquo; They also have three correspond- ing appellations in relation to Paramātmā, namely, Vaiśvānara (or Virat), Hiranyagarbha (or Sūtrātmā), and Iśvara.m-svode ads yd (The Bhagavatam verse accepts the three states, but it does not concur that the jiva becomes Paramātmā when free of them. Here it should be noted that although the states of viśva, taijasa, and prājña refer to the conditioning of the jiva in wakefulness, dreaming, and deep sleep, they ultimately indicate the Supreme Person. While instructing Yudhisthira, Śrī Narada describes the path called deva- yana, adopted by those who have attained to the state of tranquility, having abandoned all material identification. In this verse, he indi- cates that after dissolving the upadhis of viśva, taijasa, and prăjña, one attains the fourth state (turiya), or in other words, the pure self (SB 7.15.54).</em>
ad for blooda brainsqu add to the aids fed th Śrī Sūta Gosvāmi, while concluding his instructions to Saunaka at the end of the Bhāgavatam, states that it is Bhagavan alone who is to be deliberated upon through the four states of viśva, taijasa, prajña, and turiya. In these states one perceives, respectively, the external sense objects, the mental dream objects, the absence of awareness of external and internal objects, and the state of being

Śrīla Viśvanatha Cakravarti Thakura here also comments that this verse describes the vibhutis of the four expansions (vyuha) of Bhagavan stated in the previous verse (SB 12.11.21). He says that the word artha here means &ldquo;the sense objects&rdquo; [perceived in the waking state], indriya means &ldquo;the mind&rdquo; [through which one dreams], and āśraya refers to the citta, which carries the impressions from both the waking and dream states. The word jñāna refers to the happi- ness in the form of &ldquo;I slept happily,&rdquo; the ignorance in the form of &ldquo;I did not know anything,&rdquo; and also self-consciousness. Only Bhaga- vän is to be deliberated through the states of viśva, etc., as described by the above-mentioned experiences. The four states beginning with viśva are the vibhutis controlled by the four expansions (vyuha) of Bhagavan, beginning with Aniruddha.
It is with this meaning that Mandukya Upanisad describes the syllable Om with four divisions, or pādas. The first of these is there called vaiśvānara, which is simply another word for viśva, and its sphere is the waking state. The second pada is taijasa, and its sphere is the dream state. The third pada is prājña (pra-ajña), and its sphere is the state of deep sleep. The fourth state (turiya) is beyond all this and is identified with Paramātmā (Māṇḍūkya Upanisad 1-6).
While commenting upon these mantras, Śrī Vīrarāghavācārya writes that this part of the Upanisad should not be limited only to the jiva but must be extended up to Paramātmā. He says that the word prajña refers to Paramātmā who facilitates the func- tioning of the state of deep sleep. He cites the Śruti statement: &ldquo;Being embraced by the Self called prajña, [the jiva] does not know anything external or internal&rdquo; (prājñenātmanā samparişvakto na bahyaṁ kiñcana veda näntaram, BAU 4.3.21). 193x9

as clouds appear or become visible (bhavanti) in the sky through the manifestation of their own composite wholes and disappear (na bhavanti) through the dissolution of their composite wholes, doing so without touching the sky, in the same way, this world appears and disappears in Brahman. This is how the verse is to be syntactically arranged.

Avayavi (a whole inclusive of parts) means the universe in its gross form; udaya [the inception of the universe] refers to its being manifested by the glance of the Supreme Person (Purusot- tama); apyaya means its opposite, the dissolution caused by Paramätma&rsquo;s closing His eyes. Thus, the universe exists in sub- tle form [during the dissolution period] because of the existence of its cause [Paramātmā], who is qualified with the potency of the universe.

ŚRI JIVA EXPLAINS that although the universe is real and nondif- ferent from Paramātmā, it does not influence Him. All the changes that occur within the universe do not cause any change or perturba- tion in Paramātmā. Thus, there is no need to propose that the world is illusory to establish His immutability, as is done in Advaitavada. The universe undergoes the states of manifestation and unmanifes- tation according to the principle of sat-karya-vāda. Therefore, it was said (in SB 11.24.19)3 that time precipitates the manifestation of

Dear King, in this world the part (avayava) of every whole pos- sessing parts (avayavi) has been declared to be real. This is due to the fact that parts are seen to exist even in the absence of a whole unit, just as the threads of a cloth exist even when there is no cloth. (SB 12.4.27)&rsquo;

The part (avayava) of all gross objects that contain parts (avaya- vinām) is their cause, and it is said to be real (satya); that is, it exists without exception. This can be observed in the world, as shown [by Suka] in the second half of the verse. The word artha here means the &ldquo;gross form,&rdquo; without which [the part or cause exists], as even without the cloth [the thread exists].

THIS VERSE makes it perfectly clear that a cause exists even in the absence of its manifest effect. Thus, the world exists in a subtle, causal form within Paramātmā, even when it has been dissolved. The existence of the cause is not dependent upon the effect. It is the cause that manifests as its effect through the influence of Paramatma&rsquo;s time potency. bregǝbal atzia

By negative inferential insight (vyatireka), [Suka] establishes that the effect also exists in the cause: &ldquo;Whatever is perceived according to [its] universal (samanya) or particular (viseṣa) characteristics is an illusion&rdquo; (SB 12.4.28)?

It takes the form, &ldquo;Where there is no fire, there is no smoke.&rdquo; In this verse, that which has a beginning and an end is being excluded as incompatible with the Absolute Reality, and therefore as illusory. The formulation of the negative argument is clearer in the commentary that follows the verse. This
as form of reasoning is discussed more fully in Anuccheda 104. There also seems to
be considerable discussion in the Sarva-samvadini to Bhagavat Sandarbha.

form (viseṣa), namely, that of the universe, then this is incor- rect. This is because whatever is perceived according to [its] universal [unqualified] or particular [qualified] form is an illu- sion, that is to say, vivarta-vāda. According to the vivarta-vāda theory, pure Brahman alone appears as the universe through the potency of ignorance. This is not acceptable to us because pariņāma-vāda is based on the prior existence of a real effect in potential form in its real cause (i.e., sat-karya-vāda). T

in the cause.
IN THE PREVIOUS ANUCCHEDA, it was shown that the cause exists prior to the effect. When the cause is present, the effect manifests. This is called anvaya, or positive concomitance. Conversely, when the cause is absent, the effect cannot be generated. This is called vyatireka, or negative concomitance. A cause is, therefore, defined as that by whose existence the effect occurs and by whose non- existence the effect does not take place (Nyaya-värttika on sutra 1.1 of the Nyaya-bhāṣya)
Causes are of two types: vaidika (that which is known from the Vedas) and laukika (that which is known from empirical obser- vation). The first type is knowable only through positive infer- ence (anvaya), meaning only through the positive existence of the cause. The second type, however, can be understood from both positive and negative inference (anvaya and vyatireka), or in other words, from either the presence or the absence of the cause. Param- atma&rsquo;s causality is classed as vaidika, because He is knowable only through the Veda. There is no possibility of vyatireka in the case of Paramātmā because He is ever-existent.langen A
In this connection, the doubt may be raised that during the period of dissolution the cause is existent but there is no effect; Paramātmā is present but there is no universe. How then can it be said that there is an anvaya relation between Paramātmā and the universe? In reply, it is pointed out that causes are of two types,

77 The Effect Exists in Its Cause
namely, phalopadhayi (the effective cause) and svarupa-yogyatva (the potential cause). In the first case, if the cause is present, then the effect must be immediately produced, as in the case of burn- ing wood that generates heat. In the second case, the cause has the potential to bring forth the effect but does not do so unless certain conditions are satisfied. This is the case with wood that has not yet been kindled. Although wood is the potential source of heat, it does not manifest this potential unless it is set on fire. Similarly, Param- ātmā is the potential cause of the cosmos during the period of dis- solution, and yet the latter is not brought forth until Paramātmā intends it. boss1wh

Śrī Jiva Gosvāmi interprets the half-verse cited in this anuccheda in an unusual manner. The word samanya (universality) is gener- ally used to denote the generic quality of a class, such as manhood for men. It is uniform and exists in all members of its class. Nyaya accepts universality as eternal. In contrast, viseșa (particularity) is specific to a singular substance and serves to distinguish it from other members of the same class. abby-nimaly of galbo
In the present context, however, these words do not carry such meaning. Most commentators have glossed samanya as cause and viśeşa as effect. This stands to reason, as the etymological meaning of the word samanya is &ldquo;that which is the essence of those sub- stances that are equal&rdquo; (samānāṁ bhavaḥ). In this sense, sāmānya would refer to a cause that is found in each of its effects. Cor- respondingly, the effect is called viseșa because it is a specific manifestation of the generalized cause (samanya). of sand
Śrī Jiva extends these meanings still further to refute the the- ory of vivarta-vāda. He says that the word samanya refers to Brah- man. The reason for this is that Brahman is devoid of all particular- ity, such as qualities or form. A universal (samanya), as per Nyaya terminology, is also without qualities or form. Śri Jiva says that according to vivarta-vāda, it is Brahman that appears as the world,

endowed with particular (viseṣa) form and qualities. Sukadeva declares that anything that is perceivable as sāmānya and viseșa is an illusion. Thus, he does not support vivarta-vāda.
Illusion has a beginning and an end. Therefore, it is not real. Since the universe is real, as has been demonstrated, it must exist in its unmanifest and subtle causal state within Paramātmā during the periods of dissolution. This is the negative inferen- tial logic being used here. An example of negative inference (vyatireka-anumāna) is as follows: da to sau leitast eri elämä Amtemere lit dirol idgnord Jon al 191tal art joy basnoitulos Commentary

<li>Earth is not like that (i.e., it is not devoid of fragrance).</li>
<li>Therefore, earth is different from other substances.
According to vivarta-vāda, ajñāna has two potencies, called avarana and vikṣepa. The avarana potency conceals the real nature of an object, and the vikṣepa-sakti projects various illusory objects. These two potencies of ajñāna have a beginningless relation with Brahman, which is sat, cit, and ananda by nature. The avaraṇa potency of ajñāna covers the cit and ananda nature of Brahman, and the vikṣepa potency manifests the various objects of the universe. The sat potency of Brahman is not covered by the avarana potency, because sat, or existence, is experienced even in the illusory objects of the world.
Brahman is qualityless, and the same Brahman appears as the universe because of the power of ignorance. The half-verse cited here states that such a thing is only an illusion. If the universe is an illusion, then its cause, Brahman, must also be an illusion, because an illusory effect cannot be the outcome of a real object. But of course, Brahman is accepted as real in vivarta-väda. This implies that the universe must be real, for otherwise Brahman would be proven illusory. Since Brahman is accepted as real in both vivarta- vāda as well as pariņāma-vāda, it is the latter that is acceptable on

ONE MAY THEN ASK whether one should not accordingly accept, like ārambha-vāda and vivarta-vāda, that an effect comes into being without having existed before. In response Śri Suka says: &ldquo;Since cause and effect are mutually dependent, everything that has a beginning and an end is without substantiality (avastu)&rdquo; (SB 12.4.28)!

NEITHER THE ARAMBHA-VĀDĪ, i.e., the Naiyāyika, nor the vivarta- vādi accepts that the effect exists in the cause. According to the Naiyayikas, the effect is generated anew, and according to the vivarta-vādīs, it is only imagined as new out of ignorance, or it is a creation only on the phenomenal level of being (vyāvahārika- satta). The vivarta-vādīs claim that only Brahman is real and that the universe is illusory, or mithya. According to them, Brahman is the universal, samanya (see the previous anuccheda), having no form or qualities. Thus, it cannot possess causal power.
If such were the case, then it would not be possible to define a relation of cause and effect, because one is dependent upon the other for its delineation. If the cause is real, the effect cannot be an illusion; otherwise, it could not be related to the cause. Real ingre- dients, upādāna, cannot have a relation with an illusory effect. This is the defect in the vivarta-vāda theory of the universe. The object may not be what it purports to be or what it seems to be, but the illusion as to its nature exists in the subjective perception of the observer, not in the object itself.

For example, if we say that clay does not contain a pot in poten- tial form, then we cannot claim that the clay is the cause of the pot prior to its production. And if there is no cause, then the effect can- not take place. The description of one is dependent on the other

and vice versa. This is called anyo&rsquo;nyāpāśraya-dosa, or the defect of mutual dependence.
For example: A traveler asks a local boy, &ldquo;Where is Ram&rsquo;s house?&rdquo; The boy replies, &ldquo;In front of Shyam&rsquo;s house.&rdquo; The traveler then asks, &ldquo;And where is Shyam&rsquo;s house?&rdquo; The boy answers, &ldquo;Oh! It is in front of Ram&rsquo;s house.&rdquo; s borg of swoq edi and edi If it is accepted that the effect is non-existent prior to its produc- tion, then even when a pot is produced, it cannot be said that clay is its cause, because for cause and effect to be related, they must exist simultaneously. This is the defect in the arambha-vāda theory. Therefore, to prove the existence of a cause, it must be accepted that the effect exists as a potential within it. This potential is nothing but the subtle state of the effect.
Visinammo
If one objects that if the effect is already present in the cause, then why not simply call the cause the effect? And why does an agent have to act to produce the effect? Why do cause and effect have different names, different qualities, and distinct functions? The answer is that the cause is the effect in potentia and thus not exactly the same as the effect when manifest. An agent is needed to manifest the effect from its potential state.

Commentary

THE UNIVERSE is not independent of Paramātmā. Matter cannot exist independently of consciousness; therefore, the universe or matter cannot be defined independently of it. Matter does not exist for the sake of matter, but for the sake of consciousness. In Bhaga- vad Gită (7.5), Śrī Kṛṣṇa says that matter is His inferior potency, and consciousness, His superior potency; it is this conscious potency that upholds the universe.
In the 26th chapter of the Third Canto of Bhagavata Purāṇa, there is a description of the creation of the cosmic being. There it is said that the cosmic being (Virat) did not arise until the Puruşa (Param- ātmā) entered it. One of the problems with modern science is that they have excluded subjectivity, and thus, theorists are unable to come up with a comprehensive explanation of the universe. Sci- entists have come up with different theories, such as the unified field theory, string theory, etc., but none has been successful in this respect. Michael Brooks writes in his popular book 13 Things That Don&rsquo;t Make Sense:
At the first Solvay physics conference in 1911 - the world&rsquo;s first physics conference - the delegates debated what was to be made of the newly discovered phenomenon of radioactivity. Here in this hotel [Hotel Metropole in Brussels], Marie Curie, Hendrik Lorentz, and the young Albert Einstein debated how it was that radioactive 19 material could apparently defy the laws of conservation of energy
and momentum. Radioactivity was an anomaly; it did not make he sense. The problem was eventually solved by the birth of quan-b tum theory. At the 1927 Solvay conference, though, the strange nature of quantum theory caused its own problems, provoking Einstein, and Niels Bohr, Lorentz and Erwin Schrödinger, Ernest Rutherford and John von Neumann to sit discussing these new laws
532
79 The Universe Cannot Be Explained Independently of Paramātmā
of physics with the same degree of confusion as they had shown towards radioactivity.
It was an extraordinary moment in the history of science. Quan- tum theory encapsulated the novel idea that some things in nature are entirely random, occurring without cause. This made no sense to Einstein or Bohr, and the pair spent their time outside the for- mal discussion sparring over what it all meant. They had entirely different philosophical approaches to dealing with that mystery, however. To Bohr, it meant something was wrong with the the-of ory; it was here in this hotel that Einstein made his famous remark the that &ldquo;God does not play dice.&rdquo; Bohr&rsquo;s reaction faces up to scientists&rsquo; d bet biggest frustration: they don&rsquo;t get to set the rules. &ldquo;Einstein,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;Stop telling God what to do.&ldquo;DRE THE FIREP SIP FF | S
की
Neither man lived to see a satisfactory solution to the enigma - it remains unsolved, in fact. But if some delegates at the twenty- A third Solvay conference are to be believed, it seems Bohr might have been right about there being limits to science. Half of the sit- ting theorists present, some of the greatest minds in the world, are now convinced that we can never fully comprehend the universe. The other seekers after a &ldquo;theory of everything&rdquo; think there must be some explanation available to us. But they have no idea where to find it. What has led to this extraordinary situation? (Brooks 2009: 3)
will of course, Śrī Jiva has the answer to the question raised by Dr. Michael Brooks. Nothing can be explained satisfactorily with- out its cause, and Paramātmā is the ultimate cause. Without tak- ing Him into consideration, all explanations are incomplete, even those given by the Naiyayikas and the Advaitavādīs. alley, yet they

If one thinks of Him as diverse, then he is devoid of authentic knowing (avidvan), because His plural- ity, characterized by being with or without adjuncts (upādhis), is like the distinction between the space enclosed within a pot (ghaṭa-ākāśa) and all-pervading space (mahā-ākāśa), between the light in one&rsquo;s courtyard and that pervading the world, and between the air (vayu) outside and inside the body.
Commentary

independent
IT WAS EXPLAINED in the previous section that the universe does not undergo any change without the presence of Paramātmā. Just as our body undergoes various stages of change from birth onwards because of the presence of the conscious self (ātmā) within it, the universe evolves because of the presence of Paramātmā. Earlier it was also said that Paramātmā is untouched by the universe. Does this mean that there are two Paramātmās, one immanent within the universe and delimited by it, and the other free from all delimitation? This is the question being answered here.
Śrī Jiva Gosvāmi has interpreted the verse under discussion here in a specific manner, keeping the Advaitavada view in mind. Although according to them Brahman is the only reality, yet they imagine that it has two categories, namely, with upadhis and with- out upadhis? The sopadhika Brahman is the cause of the universe and without ontological reality, whereas nirupadhika Brahman is the ultimate reality and in fact the only reality. This view is not accepted here. There are no divisions in Brahman or Paramātmā.

III The Ontology of Maya - Bahiranga-sakti
One may raise a doubt in this connection. Earlier (Anuccheda 2) it was stated that there are three Purusas, or Paramātmās. So how can such plurality be denied here? The reply is that although there are three manifestations of Paramātmā, they are one ontologically. There is no ultimate difference between them, unlike the differ- ence between the two Brahmans - sopadhika and nirupadhika - imagined by Advaitavada.vn) gal woudottaedtus to blovab al ad

GOLDEN ORNAMENTS may differ in shape, and accordingly they are referred to by different names, but the underlying material is one, i.e., gold. In the same way, all objects of the world have one source, and thus all names and forms belong to Him. When Arjuna beheld the universal form of Kṛṣṇa, he called Him sarva, or every- thing (GĪTĀ 11.40)? Everything exists within the universal form; therefore, Paramātmā is called sarva-nama (&ldquo;all names&rdquo;) in Skanda Purāna.

The Sanskrit word for a pronoun is sarva-nama, which means &ldquo;all names,&rdquo; because a pronoun can be used for anyone or any- thing. In keeping with the ideas expressed in this anuccheda, Jiva Gosvāmi has used the word kṛṣṇa-nāma, or &ldquo;Kṛṣṇa&rsquo;s name,&rdquo; in place of sarva-nāma, to refer to pronouns in his grammatical treatise Hari-nāmāmṛta-vyākaraṇa (2.166).

The meaning is as follows: Just as a dense cloud, which is gen- erated, revealed, and illuminated by the sun alone, is dark- ness for the eyes, which are part of the sun, meaning that the dense clouds plunge the earth and sky into abject darkness, in the same way, the phenomenal &ldquo;I&rdquo;-consciousness, which is an attribute of Brahman (brahma-guna), meaning that it is a product of Paramatma&rsquo;s potency, and which is glanced upon by that [Brahman] (tad-ikṣita), i.e., illuminated by Paramātmā, is bondage for the individual ātmā (ätma-bandhana). This is to say that it covers the light of the essential nature of the jiva, which is an integrated part of Brahman (brahmaṁśakasya), meaning that it is an infinitesimal portion of Paramatma&rsquo;s intermediary potency.

82 The Jiva Is Covered by the Potency of Paramātmā
Commentary of the wee periding this comparison

IT HAS BEEN CONCLUDED that the universe is not a creation of the jiva&rsquo;s ignorance, as is propounded by the Advaita School, but a manifestation of the extrinsic potency of Paramātmā. Therefore, the universe cannot be destroyed by the enlightenment of an indi- vidual being. There is no necessity for such an occurrence. What is needed is to give up one&rsquo;s identification with the universe as an object of separate enjoyment. This is possible by understand- ing the misidentification between the ātmā and the phenomenal &ldquo;I&rdquo;-consciousness, or ahankara, which is a product of the extrinsic energy. This misidentification covers the real svarupa of the ātmā.
The example of the sun and clouds shows how the energy com- ing from one source, i.e., the sun, can perform contrary functions, namely, both revealing and covering. Clouds are produced by the heat of the sun, and they cover the vision of our eyes, which are also the energy of the sun. The cloud covers the object, whereas sunlight reveals it, although both are energies of the same sun.
When, however, the clouds are dispersed by the wind, the sun is then directly revealed. In the same way, when one gives up iden- tification with the phenomenal &ldquo;I&rdquo;-consciousness, which is rooted in the separatist desire for enjoyment, and embraces one&rsquo;s true self-identity as a servant of Paramātmā, immediate awareness of Paramātmā then comes to light.

83 Liberation Is Attained by the Grace of Paramātmā
In the portion of the verse providing the comparison, &ldquo;as soon as the cloud generated by the sun is scattered,&rdquo; it is evident that such scattering is accomplished not through the capacity of the eyes, but only by the influence of the sun. From this analogy [it is clear], in the portion being illustrated by the example also, that the phenomenal &ldquo;I&rdquo;-consciousness is destroyed or vanishes only through the mercy of Paramātmā, which arises when one inquires into Him (jijñāsayā). This part [of the verse] refutes [the idea] that the dissipation of the [phenomenal] ego can be accomplished merely through the living being&rsquo;s own attainment of knowledge.
अतो विवर्तवादो नाभ्युपगतः । अत्र चोपाधिरिति विशेषणेन स्वरूपभूताहङ्कारस्त्वन्य एवेति स्पष्टीभूतम् ।

Therefore, vivarta-vāda is not accepted here. It is also being made clear by use of the qualifying term upadhi (adjunct), applied to the phenomenal ego (ahankära), that the [authentic] &ldquo;I&rdquo;-consciousness that is intrinsic to one&rsquo;s true spiritual nature is indeed distinct [from the phenomenal ego].
एवं यथा दृष्टान्ते घनमयमहान्धकारावरणाभावात् तत्प्रभावेण योग्यतालाभाच्च चक्षः कर्तृभूतं स्वरूपं कर्मभूतमीक्षते स्वस्वरूपप्रकाशमस्तित्वेन जानाति स्वशक्तिप्राकट्यं लभत इत्यर्थः ।

Thus, just as in the example, it is due to the removal of the cov- ering of abject darkness caused by the dense clouds, and due to the resultant attainment of its capacity [to see] through the sun&rsquo;s influence, that the eye as agent [i.e., as subject] sees its true nature (svarupa), its object. The eye then becomes aware of the existence of its luminous nature, meaning that it is enabled to exercise its power [of seeing].

ŚRI JIVA CONTINUES to refute vivarta-vada by referring to the final teachings of Sukadeva to King Parikṣit. The interesting point to be noted is that all these verses cited here seem to support vivarta- vāda when looked at cursorily. Some commentators, indeed, have explained these verses from the vivarta-vāda point of view. But such an interpretation would contradict the mood, heart, and intention of both Sukadeva and Parikṣit, which were expressed in the very beginning of Tattva Sandarbha. Keeping this in mind and thus providing a harmonious meaning, Śrī Jiva reveals the real purport of these verses.
No one can become liberated by his own endeavor. Śrī Kṛṣṇa has stated categorically that only those who take shelter of Him can transcend His formidable māyā (GITA 7.14). If the firmament is covered with dense cloud, the eyes have no power to dispel it. In dense darkness the eye is not even aware of its own seeing capacity. The sun alone can dispel the cloud. Once the cloud is dispersed and there is light, the eye can function and also realize its capacity to see. It can also see the sun.

Similarly, in our conditioned state, we have no power to escape our own conditioning? Even if we are situated in knowledge, we cannot get rid of this conditioning, because knowledge is also part of māyā, namely, the sattva-guna. This was discussed in Anuccheda 54. When Arjuna posed the question how to transcend the gunas of prakṛti, Śrī Kṛṣṇa explicitly replied that only by unde- viated devotion can one go beyond the gunas (GITĀ 14.26). This refutes the theory of vivarta-vāda, which states that when one 900 bjez ai 31 law, as bafilamaze anted going eds of 31 998 20 See Anuccheda 44. and gainson(antamenno) odmamy bluoda

The problem lies at the level of ahankara, which is above manas and buddhi. Even if one realizes that one is not the body and thus becomes jivan-mukta, how would he become free from ahankara- tattva and mahat-tattva? They will still linger on, and one can make the mistake of confusing the mahat or pradhāna, which is also sometimes called Brahman, as in GĪTĀ 14.3-4, with transcen-
s in GITA 14.3-4 dent Brahman. Then one can merge in prakṛti and stay there indef- initely, as hinted at in the Yoga-sutra, &ldquo;For some who are unembod- ied and are merged in matter, the state of samprajñāta-samādhi is characterized by absorption in prakṛti&rdquo; (Yoga-sutra 1.19)3
The word upadhi qualifying ätmanah in this verse indicates that the pure self has its own intrinsic &ldquo;I&rdquo;-consciousness, besides the phenomenal &ldquo;I&rdquo;-consciousness, or ahankara-tattva, an evolute of pradhana. This also contradicts the principle of vivarta-vāda, which does not admit any &ldquo;I&rdquo;-consciousness in the liberated state of the jiva. Indeed, without a real &ldquo;I,&rdquo; it would be difficult to explain an adhyāsa (superimposition) of the material &ldquo;I,&rdquo; because a real substratum is necessary for adhyāsa.immath to brows air drw

IN THE FOURTH CHAPTER of the Twelfth Canto, Śrī Suka describes four types of dissolution. The fourth type is called atyantika- pralaya, or ultimate dissolution. This refers to the liberation of the individual being, described in verses 23 to 34, which is one of the ten topics discussed in Bhagavata Purana? This is the last verse in the series. These verses explain in detail the cause of bondage and the process of becoming free from it.
While explaining these verses, Śrī Jīva Gosvāmi has refuted vivarta-vāda along with Vijñānavāda and asat-karya-vāda, and has firmly established sat-karya-vāda. Sat-kārya-vāda is an essential foundation for the path of bhakti, and therefore, Jiva Gosvāmi has endeavored over the past few sections to establish it unequivocally. Sat-karya-väda propounds that Paramātmā, who is the cause of the cosmos, has real potency that undergoes modification to manifest the real world.

A CERTAIN GROUP OF PEOPLE say the following regarding this topic: Parameśvara has two potencies [intrinsic and extrinsic], called svarupa and mayā [respectively]. By the first, He man- ifests the opulence of His own nature, and by the second, like a magical show, He displays the creation of the universe to the jivas deluded by her alone. It is indeed seen that a person having various types of knowledge acts in different ways. This descrip- tion does not come into the category of Advaitavada [though it seems to]. Only a real agent shows a veridical object to a real seer by the real potency of maya. The same is also seen in the world as well. Therefore, let the above [point of view] also be accepted.

THE OPENING STATEMENT of this section is mysterious, since Śrī Jiva does not make explicit whose opinion he is restating. Our own estimation is that he is talking about Śrīdhara Svāmi, who, accord- ing to Śrī Jīva himself, has written commentaries that are a mixture of Advaitavada and bhakti (viz. Tattva Sandarbha, Anuccheda 27). Out of respect for the Svāmi, Śrī Jiva is careful not to refute him openly, and yet he also does not want that Svāmī might be mis- understood as an Advaitavādī. Śrī Jīva Gosvāmī is also writing in defense of Svami&rsquo;s acceptance of sat-karya-vāda, lest anyone try to refute the former by citing the latter&rsquo;s Advaitic comments, know- ing well that Jiva Gosvāmi has great reverence for Śrīdhara Svāmi.
Svami&rsquo;s commentary on the verses from SB 12.4, cited in the pre- vious few sections, is in line with Advaitavada. Therefore, Śrī Jīva has not referred to it in his own commentary on these verses, which is otherwise his custom. For example, on verse SB 12.4.29, Svämi writes: &ldquo;In this way, the unreal nature of the universe has been proven by many arguments.&rdquo; This is in sharp contrast to Śrī Jiva&rsquo;s verdict at the end of Anuccheda 71, &ldquo;Therefore, it is concluded that the universe is indeed real.&rdquo; While commenting upon SB 12.4.30, Svāmī writes: a) woled 251w svit 12 dose au votal il
199
An objection is raised: But certainly there is plurality even of the truly existent, namely, the Self in the form of the jiva and Brah- man. In response to this, the verse states that if one admits of such plurality, then he is devoid of authentic knowing. So, how is it that there is a difference between them in terms of practical dealings?

From these statements, one might think Śrīdhara Svāmī to be a staunch Advaitavādī. Śrī Jīva shows, however, that this is not the case, which is evident if one reads the commentary of Svāmi on the complete Bhāgavata Purāņa. It is just that his interpretations are sometimes slanted toward Advaitavada.
saliaron 25ob svil
by What Śrī Jiva writes here in these few lines is based upon Svāmi&rsquo;s commentary on Bhāgavata Purana, disregarding the Advaitic slant. In particular, the line beginning with satyenaiva kartra, &ldquo;by the real agent alone &hellip;,&rdquo; is a mirror image of Śrīdhara&rsquo;s statement in his commentary on SB 1.1.2: &ldquo;The word vastava (real) in this verse means that the jiva is an integrated part of the truly existent (vastu) [i.e., Absolute Reality], māyā is the potency of the truly existent (vastu), the universe is the creation of the truly exis- tent (vastu), all this is nothing other than the truly existent (vastu); it is not separate from that (vastu); vedya (knowable) signifies that It (vastu) can be known without much effort.&rdquo;&rdquo;
Since in some places Svāmī has acknowledged the world as unreal, Śrī Jiva composes an original kärikä verse beginning with satyam na, &ldquo;For us any real object&hellip;&rdquo; By this he means that what is important is that Śrīdhara Svāmī has accepted bhakti to Kṛṣṇa as supreme, and therefore, it is of no concern whether he says that
the world is real or unreal.
It is for this reason that Śrī Jiva writes below (in Anuccheda 85.2) that his explanation of verse SB 10.87.36 in Anuccheda 70.2 is more or less the same as that given by Śrīdhara Svāmi. In reality, Śrī- dhara&rsquo;s explanation to that verse is mixed with the Advaita prin- ciple and does not match his bhakti explanations given elsewhere.

In this doctrine, the explanation of the Śrutis&rsquo; prayer in SB 10.87.36 [quoted above in Anuccheda 70.2] should be understood to be largely in accord with that of Śridhara Svāmi. Some- times in the inferences (anumāna) given by him, the difference [between the svarupa- and māyā-śaktis] is concluded to be non- existent. From this, in his opinion, Vaikuntha and other aspects of the spiritual world also become unreal like the material world.
anemonerig In this, his intention is as follows:

We [Śrīdhara] establish an object that is to be known through recognized means of valid knowing, such as perception, as hav- ing a particular nature by comparing it to another object that is already known through the very same methods. But an object that is not known by such means [perception and so on] and which can be known only by the direct experience of those who have realized scriptural truth, cannot be made otherwise even by citing unlimited examples. Thus, the propagation of nondif- ference between the jiva and Iśvara is only in the sense of both being conscious.

III The Ontology of Maya - Bahiranga-sakti
gitterged bill at vi dedw of galbuonos siqioning inlod sandbine of on The doctrine referred to here is that stated at the beginning of this section, i.e., Paramātmā has two types of potencies, namely, svarupa and māyā. In his commentary on verse SB 10.87.36 (cf. Anu- ccheda 70.2), Śrīdhara Svāmi has established that there is no differ- ence whatsoever between Brahman and the universe. His famous statement is, &ldquo;I am not establishing abheda, nondifference, but denying the difference, because the universe has appeared from Brahman, like the coil from a snake.&rdquo;&rdquo;
the
ence from
Later on, however, he supports the idea of andha-parampară, or a beginningless blind succession, and proves that the uni- verse is asat and a superimposition on Brahman because of this beginningless succession of samskāras
The outcome of such an explanation is that even the spiritual realm in the form of Vaikuntha is taken to be unreal. Śrī Jiva has earlier (Anuccheda 70) refuted this explanation by the example of fake coins. Now, out of respect for Śrīdhara Svāmi, he explains the intention of the latter in writing such a commentary. The mean- ing is that Śrīdhara is providing a material analogy only to explain material phenomena. He is not refuting the existence of the Vai- kuntha planets, which is a matter of direct experience for realized devotees. Nobody can deny the experience of these devotees by any amount of logic and analogy. Moreover, the oneness established is only to corroborate that the jiva is conscious like Paramātmā and thus distinct from matter. There is no absolute oneness between
them.

It has been said that the Supreme Regulator (Parameśvara) enacts the work of creation, and so on, of the universe through His natural māyā potency, and only the jiva is deluded by it. The doubt in this regard [as to Parameśvara&rsquo;s absolute non- involvement with maya] is removed in eight verses containing Vidura&rsquo;s questions and Maitreya&rsquo;s answers to them:
ब्रह्मन् कथं भगवतश्चिन्मात्रस्याविकारिणः ।
लीलया चापि युज्येरन् निर्गुणस्य गुणाः क्रियाः ॥ २४५ ॥
ba[Śrī Vidura asked:] &ldquo;O Brāhmaṇa, how can Bhagavan, who is consciousness alone (cin-matrasya), immutable (avikāriṇaḥ), and free of the gunas (nirgunasya) become involved with the gunas and functions [of prakṛti], even as a matter of cosmic play (lilä)?&rdquo; (SB 3.7.2)
हे ब्रह्मन् ! चिन्मात्रस्य चिन्मात्रस्वरूपस्य सतः स्वरूपशक्त्या भगवतः श्रीवैकुण्ठादिगत- तादृशैश्वर्यादियुक्तस्य ।
O Brāhmaṇa, that Being is exclusively consciousness (cin- mätrasya), meaning that His essential nature is that of con- sciousness alone. He is Bhagavan (bhagavataḥ) [i.e., inclusive of all opulence] by virtue of His intrinsic potency (svarupa-śakti), meaning that He is self-endowed with transphenomenal opu- lences, such as those found in Śrī Vaikuntha, which are identical in nature to that intrinsic potency.

He is thus free of the material gunas (nirgunasya), meaning that He is untouched by them. He is therefore also immutable (avikā- rinah), meaning that He never undergoes any transformation unlike a material agent. How so? Although unlimited actions springing from the play of the intrinsic potency appear in Him, the reservoir of infinite ever-arising self-expansions (prakāśa), yet because all such actions are functions of His eternally self- established intrinsic potency, He, as the agent by which such actions are made to appear, is never subject to any change in His condition.
निर्विकारस्य च कथं सत्त्वादयः प्राकृतगुणाः ? कथं वा तदासङ्गहेतुकाः स्थित्यादयः क्रि- याश्च युज्येरन् ? ततश्च चिन्मात्रवस्तुविरोधादेव ते च ताश्च न युज्यन्ते । भगवत्त्वे तु स्वैरचेष्टयापि न युज्येरन्नित्याह “लीलया वापि” इति ।
How then could the material gunas, such as sattva, be attributed to Him, who is devoid of any transformation? And how can func- tions, such as sustenance, which are caused by association with the gunas, be linked to Him? Consequently, because these gunas and functions are contrary to the purely conscious reality, they cannot be associated with Him. Moreover, [it cannot be argued that] since He is Bhagavan, they are connected to Him even by His free and independent action, and so [Śrī Vidura stipulates] &ldquo;[not] even as a matter of cosmic play&rdquo; (lilayā vāpi).
अत्राविकारित्वनिर्गुणत्वाभ्यां सह चिन्मात्रत्वं भगवत्त्वं चेत्युभयमपि स्वीकृत्यैव पूर्वप- क्षिणा पृष्टम् । ततश्च तस्य चिन्मात्रस्वरूपस्य भवतु भगवत्त्वं तत्रास्माकं न सन्देहः किन्तु तस्य कथमितरगुणादिस्वीकारो युज्यत इत्येव पृच्छ्यत इति वाक्यार्थः ॥
Here the questioner raises this issue even after accepting both Bhagavan&rsquo;s conscious nature and divine majesty, along with His immutability and freedom from the gunas. He therefore says: &ldquo;We admit that the Being whose essential nature is that of con- sciousness alone is Bhagavan;1o in this we have no doubt. But
10 The subtlety of Sri Jiva&rsquo;s phrasing here is difficult to capture in English. Though

how can we agree that He accepts other [material] qualities?&rdquo; This is all that Vidura is asking. This is the literal meaning of the verse.

Commentary
se behind Creat Śrī Jiva now begins a new topic. How can Bhagavan, who is tran- scendental to material nature, become involved in activities related to prakṛti? And how can a conscious living being come under the sway of prakṛti&rsquo;s gunas? This is a riddle that cannot be solved by any amount of logical gymnastics. The Advaitavādīs have tried to provide a solution by explaining the universe away completely, attempting to prove its illusory nature. Śrī Jiva will present the viewpoint of the Bhagavatam in the upcoming sections (up to
ith divine Anuccheda 92). alone and is
Śrī Jiva introduces this topic to illustrate that there is no need to admit the Advaitavada theory of the universe to establish that Brahman remains untouched by prakṛti or the defects of the mate- rial creation. Consequently, although there appears to be a sudden shift in the discourse, it is related with Śrīdhara Svāmi&rsquo;s previous explanation. Śrīdhara accepts both Brahman and the world as real, and yet he sometimes subscribes to the Advaitavāda view.
In this verse, the adjectival compound cin-matrasya (of the nature of consciousness alone) implies that Bhagavan has abso- lutely no material gunas inherent in Him. This is the significance of the suffix matra.&rdquo; Although māyā is Bhagavan&rsquo;s potency, and although potency cannot exist without its potent source, Bha- gavan is nevertheless distinct from māyā. He is thus the purely
the essential meaning is as given above, the literal translation would be, &ldquo;Let the &lsquo;Bhagavan-ness&rsquo; be admitted, of that whose essential nature is that of consciousness alone&rdquo; (tasya cin-matra-svarupasya bhavatu bhagavattvam). 11 mätram kärtsnye&rsquo;vadhārane

MOREOVER, the question is redoubled, because He who is consciousness alone and is self-endowed with divine majesty (bhagavattva) cannot have inferior material gunas and actions. Furthermore, it is improper to suggest that this could be so even as a matter of play, like that of a child, because of the dissimilar- ity [between the play of a child and that of Bhagavan]. Vidura expresses this as follows:

III The Ontology of Maya - Bahiranga-sakti
The word udyama refers to that which impels one to action. Desire (kāma) is the reason impelling the child to play. When, however, the child&rsquo;s desire to play arises from another (anya- tah), this can be due either to desire for another object or because of being induced by another child. But Bhagavan is fully satisfied in His own Self and in the majesty of His own essential nature, and therefore, He is always detached from all else. How then can the desire to play arise in Him prompted from something other, i.e., from some external cause, such as an individual jiva or the universe?
Commentary
WIDGET
=551 25
आज वि ($tels one) ashish foop &amp; refoveaine at LA IN THE PREVIOUS VERSE, it was said that even lilä, or the cosmic play of Bhagavan, cannot be the cause behind creation. The present verse explains the reason why. A person engages in play or sport to experience pleasure. But Bhagavan is pleasure personified. He is ānanda-maya, meaning that ānanda, or bliss, is His very nature. He has no need to seek ananda elsewhere. In fact, being One without a second, there is nothing outside of Him. A child likes to play with toys or with other children to derive pleasure, but Bhagavan is āpta- kāma, He whose desires are fully satisfied.
So, it cannot be said that Bhagavan creates the universe as a sport for pleasure. Moreover, even if He were to engage in sport for pleasure, would He do so by using the petty material energy con- sisting of inferior gunas? Would He not rather do so by employing His own intrinsic spiritual energy? So, Vidura&rsquo;s first question here is why would Bhagavan engage in activities at all, being fully con- tent within Himself? And secondly, if He were to play, how could He do so with the material energy?

NOR IS IT DENIABLE that these gunas and actions exist in Him, because it is well known that they do. So Vidura continues:
अस्राक्षीद् भगवान् विश्वं गुणमय्यात्ममायया ।
तया संस्थापयत्येतद् भूयः प्रत्यपिधास्यति ॥ २४७ ||
Through His own maya, consisting of the three guņas, Bhaga- vān evolved the universe. Through her, He regulates it and shall cover it up once again. (SB 3.7.4)1
गुणमय्या त्रैगुण्यव्यञ्जिन्या आत्माश्रितया मायया संस्थापयति पालयति प्रत्यपिधा- स्यति प्रातिलोम्येन तिरोहितं करिष्यति ॥
obscured
By the maya that is under His shelter and which consists of the gunas, meaning that it manifests the three gunas, [He evolves the universe,] regulates it (samsthāpayati), and covers it up (pratyapidhäsyati), the latter meaning that He causes the universe to become unmanifest in the reverse order.

III The Ontology of Maya - Bahiranga-śakti
Commentary refers to that which opels one to action. Desire (ron) is the reason Impelling the child to play. When, TO VIDURA&rsquo;S QUESTION, one could present the Advaitavāda view and reply that in reality the act of creation and the created world do not exist in Brahman, who is devoid of all actions and quali- ties. Anticipating such a response, Vidura speaks the present verse. Thus, indirectly, Vidura has rejected vivarta-vāda. thed from all
The verb praty-apidhäsyati means &ldquo;re-covering up.&rdquo; Śrī Jiva follows Śrīdhara in glossing it as, pratilomyena tirohitam kariṣyati, &ldquo;bringing about its dissolution in reverse order.&rdquo; This understand- ing is in line with the prevalent idea in Sankhya, and adopted in Vedanta, of regarding the cosmic dissolution as a process of involu- tion or enfoldment, in which the elements are reabsorbed one by one into their subtle causes.

The jiva&rsquo;s consciousness cannot be lost by any of these factors, because the jiva is the shelter of unobstructed consciousness integral to its essential nature.
Commentary

THE SECOND RIDDLE is the delusion of the jiva. The jiva is conscious by nature. Its &ldquo;I&rdquo;-consciousness is thus never lost through the influ- ence of time, space, or circumstances, either of its own accord or through the influence of another person or object - five ways in which knowledge can be lost. ufsen Basins feafis
S
When our gaze is fixed on a cup located on a table, we do not see a book lying in another place due to the limitations of percep- tion. This is obstruction caused by space. In due course of time, an object becomes lost, such as with a momentary flash of light- ning. External awareness can also be suspended under specific con- ditions, such as in the dream state or because of the deterioration of memory due to old age. Knowledge can also be lost of its own accord if it is not utilized, or we can be deluded by an external source, such as mistaking a mirage for real water. Awareness of one object is lost or replaced by awareness of an intervening object. When we look at a cup, we have awareness of it; but after that, if we see a book, the immediate awareness of the cup is given up.bodoyquin
566
88 How Can the Jiva Be Deluded?
Consciousness of the self is not lost by any of these means. It is not limited by time, because it is eternal; not by space, because it is beyond space; not by any change of state, because it is immutable; not by itself, because it truly exists; nor by any other object or indi- vidual, because consciousness is nondual and hence not related to any object. Consciousness is the inherent nature of the self and is thus never lost. It is eternal like Paramātmā Himself. The prin- ciple here is that the characteristics of an eternal object are eter- nal - nityam gatam nityam. Such being the case, how is it possi- ble for a jiva to fall under the sway of maya, becoming deprived of self-awareness and absorbed in matter? This is the second question raised by Vidura.

VIDURA RAISES a pertinent doubt. Both the ātmā and Paramātmā reside in the same body, so why is it that only the individual ātmā suffers and enjoys the outcome of karma? What makes Param- ātmā immune to such experience? The ill-fortune mentioned in this verse is in the form of the absence of awareness of one&rsquo;s true nature and being deluded by prakṛti. Śrī Maitreya will now reply to all these questions in the following verses, which are cited and discussed in the upcoming sections (Anucchedas 90-92).

potency, called māyā, of Bhagavan, who possesses inconceiv- able potency in His essential nature (acintya-svarupa-śakti). This māyā &ldquo;contradicts logic,&rdquo; which means that because it is beyond rational argument, it too is inconceivable (acintya). Although both are thus inconceivable, yet because it has been clearly stated, &ldquo;the maya belonging to Bhagavan,&rdquo; and because His essential potency is intrinsic, He is not touched by sattva and the other gunas of the extrinsic māyā, nor by His own cos- mic play in the form of universal sustenance and so on, which are effects of the gunas.

In Him, there is not merely consciousness alone (cin-mătratva). The meaning of the second quarter of the verse, yan nayena viru- dhyate, according to the tantra [a system involving the deriva- tion of two or more meanings from a statement], is as follows:2 [First, reading the pronoun yat, standing for māyā, as yayā, &ldquo;with whom,&rdquo;] &ldquo;Such is Bhagavan&rsquo;s māyā, with whom there is no opposition with regard to Him (Bhagavan),&rdquo; meaning that she does not make Him the object of her opposition [i.e., she does not exert her influence over Him]; or alternatively, [read- ing yat as yā, &ldquo;which,&rdquo;] &ldquo;Such is Bhagavan&rsquo;s māyā, which is without exclusion [or neglect] with regard to Him (Bhagavan),&rdquo; meaning that in no way can māyā take Him for a non-entity (nirviṣayi-kriyata) [implying that she is completely unable to act independent of Him].

Similarly, in the prose portion of the ninth chapter of the Sixth Canto beginning with verse 6.9.34, the idea of Bhagavan&rsquo;s being an agent under the gunas is first opposed. Then in the next passage, the possibility is raised that He becomes implicated in empirical experiencing, like the jiva, due to entering the innumerable bodies generated by the gunas as their immanent indweller (antaryāmi). Finally in SB 6.9.36, in the conclusion of the argument, the element of a transrational potency (avitarkya- śaktitva) is applied to both sets of circumstances [i.e., being the agent of creation without undergoing transformation via the gunas, and being the indwelling support in all bodies without becoming implicated in experience - &ldquo;Indeed, neither of these alternatives are incompatible in You&rdquo;].

The transrational nature of the intrinsic potency is shown in the same passage (SB 6.9.36) by the various modifiers [describ- ing Bhagavan], beginning with bhagavati, and by the specific reference to the extrinsic potency māyā as being His very own (atma-māyā) [i.e., under His control]. In that same text, the phrase &ldquo;being devoid of both forms&rdquo; (svarupa-dvayābhāvāt) indicates that by His inconceivable power He is the agent behind the universe and also within it.

or undeveloped intelligence [respectively]. In the earlier prose text (SB 6.9.34), the word aśarira (lit., &ldquo;without a body&rdquo;) means &ldquo;without bodily endeavor,&rdquo; and aśarana means &ldquo;without the support of the elements, beginning with earth.&rdquo;

In SB 6.9.35, &ldquo;accepting the results of Your own actions,&rdquo; although there is mention of Bhagavan&rsquo;s acceptance of agency in regard to action (svakṛte), this too is to be applied in the sense of His being the impelling agent (hetu-karta) [whereas the immediate action is carried out by the jiva]. Therefore, here also the supremacy of His intrinsic potency has been shown.

Thus, in verse SB 2.9.33, by indicating that maya is like a reflec- tion, it is also shown that Bhagavan is untouched by her. This has also been made evident by the following statements: &ldquo;Keeping māyā at a distance by virtue of Your intrinsic con- scious potency, You are situated in the exclusivity of Your own Self&rdquo; (SB 1.7.23); and, &ldquo;Mäyä turns away from the Lord, feeling ashamed to appear before Him&rdquo; (SB 2.7.47).

jiva&rsquo;s relation with ignorance is solved by the same māyā itself due to its transrational nature [as elaborated in the second half of the verse]. The word isvarasya, &ldquo;of the ruler&rdquo; [i.e., the jiva], is to be related only with the pronoun yat, &ldquo;which&rdquo; [standing for māyā]. And here the pronoun yat is to be taken in the third case, i.e., yaya, &ldquo;by which,&rdquo; because such meaning is appropriate to the context.

The word isvarasya (&ldquo;of the one endowed with ruling power&rdquo;) signifies that the jiva is capable because consciousness is intrin- sic to its essential identity, and as such it is liberated (vimu- ktasya). Nonetheless, by the influence of maya [yaya], the jiva experiences impoverishment (kärpanya) - meaning that its inherent radiance of consciousness is eclipsed - and bondage (bandhana), meaning that it also enters into the net made of the gunas displayed by māyā.

This condition is expressed in the following statement: &ldquo;The jiva&rsquo;s autonomy (aiśvarya) is lost through identification with such deluded intellect [i.e., māyā]&rdquo; (SB 6.5.15). Intending all this, the Śrutis also stated in their prayers in SB 10.87.38 that the jiva has lost its intrinsic opulence (apeta-bhaga) because of association with māyā.

Here in the original verse (SB 3.7.9), by the statement, &ldquo;the māyā of Bhagavan,&rdquo; it follows that Bhagavan Himself is free from māyā, just as when it is said, &ldquo;Indra&rsquo;s māyā,&rdquo; it is evident that Indra is not under his own maya. This principle should be understood as applicable in the earlier part of the book also.

90 Māyā Conditions the Jiva by Her Acintya-śakti
Commentary blu
soldadurai dove 1995
sq adi saol has sugari
IN VERSE SB 3.7.2, Vidura said that Bhagavan is cin-matra, exclu- sively of the nature of consciousness. Does this mean that like the Brahman of Advaitavada He has no other attributes? Śrī Jiva says no, this is not the intention of Vidura&rsquo;s statement. What he means by cin-mātra is that there is no acit, or inert matter, in His svarupa. The suffix matra is applied here in the sense of entirety. This does not deny the existence of conscious attributes in Him. Accepting this meaning of cin-matra, the sage Maitreya replies that māyā belongs to Bhagavan. Bhagavan has svarupa-sakti, or inher- ent potency. One of the characteristics of Bhagavan is that His svarupa-śakti is acintya, transrational, or beyond the jurisdiction of conventional logic. This was established in Bhagavat Sandarbha.
Māyā also belongs to Him, and māyā too is beyond logic, acintya. In fact, in Bhagavat Sandarbha, it was shown that all energies are acintya. Although both the intrinsic energy and the extrinsic energy, māyā, are acintya, in the verse (SB 3.7.9) the specific phrase bhagavato māyā, &ldquo;the maya of Bhagavan,&rdquo; implies that Bhagavan is the owner of māyā, whereas māyā is the owned. Just as when a per- son owns a car, he is separate from the car, and any change in the car does not affect a change in the svarupa of the owner, because the car is not part of his svarupa, although owned by him. Similarly, the phrase bhagavato māyā implies that Bhagavan is free of māyā, and any modification, evolution, or action within the mayic field cannot alter the svarupa of Bhagavan - māyā being His extrinsic potency. This answers the question raised in Anuccheda 89.
to One may raise the objection that the intrinsic energy also belongs to Bhagavan, so does this mean that Bhagavan remains unaffected even by changes in the intrinsic potency? The answer is no. This is not true. The intrinsic energy is the very svarupa, or inherent nature, of Bhagavan. Any change in it will also reflect in Bhagavan. This is why it is called svarupa-sakti, and māyā is not admitted as part of His svarupa.
The answer to the question in Anuccheda 89 also lies in the tran- srational nature of maya. Although logically it is impossible that
575
Im The Ontology of Mäyä - Bahiranga-saktie
the jiva, who is also cin-matra, could come under the sway of māyā and lose its pure awareness, yet such is the case because of the acintya power of māyā.
Does this mean that Māyā is responsible for the jiva&rsquo;s unfortu- nate plight? If so, then she must be accountable for such an act. The fact is, however, that although the jiva is under the influence of the avidya potency of Maya, it is not through her own independent initiative that the jiva is compelled to do so. The jiva&rsquo;s ignorance of its true nature is beginningless. It is not that Māyā resolved to place the jiva under avidya at some particular moment in time. Hence, she is not responsible for this condition. Nor is it the result of the jiva&rsquo;s own conscious or unconscious act of will, for that too would imply a beginning of avidya. Consequently, the conscious jiva&rsquo;s coming under the sway of inert māyā is explainable only by
accepting the transrational power of māyā.
Why is the jiva referred to as isvara (ruler)? This is due to the fact that the jiva has the potential to actualize the autonomy (aiśva- rya) that is lost at present because of association with māyā (tat sanga-bhramsitaiśvaryam samsarantam kubharyavat, SB 6.5.15). The jiva is also called vimukta (liberated), because the bondage of the jiva is not real.s
Śrī Jiva breaks the sandhi, or conjunct, yan-nayena (SB 3.7.9), in two ways and gives two different meanings to yan nayena viru- dhyate. One way to break the sandhi is yat nayena, which would then mean, &ldquo;which (yat) is contrary (virudhyate) to logic (nayena).&rdquo; The other way to break the sandhi is yat na yena, meaning, &ldquo;with whom (yat taken as yaya) there is no (na) opposition (virudhyate) with regard to Him (yena), i.e., Bhagavan.&rdquo; edr seter vem 900
Because Maya is described as a reflection of Bhagavan (SB 2.9.33), she cannot overpower Him, just as a reflection of the sun cannot cover the sun. But a reflection can influence others. Similarly, Māyā cannot influence Bhagavan but can overpower the jiva. Thus, there is no bias in her behavior, i.e., in the fact that she can influ- ence only the jiva and not Bhagavan, although both are cin-matra

and both exist in the same body. This is also understood from Anucchedas 82 and 83.
balles
Śrī Jīva gives an alternative meaning to yan na yena virudhyate: Māyā does not act independent of Bhagavan. The passive verb viru- dhyate means &ldquo;is opposed.&rdquo; This can mean two things: (1) Bhaga- vän is the object of her opposition, or (2) Bhagavan is the object of her exclusion or neglect, because neglect is within the category of opposition, as is said, udāsīno&rsquo;rivad varjyaḥ, &ldquo;an indifferent person is to be shunned like an enemy&rdquo; (SB 10.24.5). The second meaning would signify that she is not concerned with Bhagavan, positively or negatively, implying that she is independent of Him. This is the view of classical Sankhya. Then by negation, it would mean that she is not independent of Him, which is the view of the Bhagava- tam. This characteristic of maya is also found in the definition of māyā given in the second of the four seed verses of the Bhagavata Purana, revealed to Brahma (SB 2.9.33).
While commenting on this latter verse (see Bhagavat Sandarbha, Anuccheda 18, p. 172), Śrī Jīva writes that māyā has two divisions, called jiva-mäyä and guṇa-māyā. The first one conceals the knowl- edge of the jiva, and the second one presents the objects of enjoy- ment. If the light of the sun reflects into a person&rsquo;s eyes, it cov- ers his vision and simultaneously presents a polychromatic display. But the reflection cannot influence the sun. Similarly, māyā can influence the jiva but not Bhagavan.

The following passage is found only in one manuscript, not in the Krama-sandarbha. The first two sentences below appear just before the ensuing interpolated passage and are repeated here just to provide a context for what follows:
In Him, there is not merely consciousness alone (cin-matratva). The meaning of the second quarter of the verse, yan nayena viru- dhyate, according to the tantra [a system involving the derivation of two or more meanings from a statement], is as follows: It is true that neither these gunas nor these actions exist in the Sup- reme Lord (Parameśvara). But she to whom these gunas belong is supported by Bhagavan, and it is on the strength of that support that her actions [of creation, etc.] are performed, all of which [are

nio then] superimposed on Him. She indeed is His extrinsic potency Au called māyā, as described in the following statement (SB 2.9.33):ife &ldquo;That which is perceived only when the underlying essential Real-
ity (artha) is not perceived, but which is never perceived in the Self (ätmani), you should know to be My maya, manifesting both as a
māyā, reflection (ābhāsa) and as darkness (tamas).&rdquo;
This description [of maya] is exactly what is being explained in the hokphrase, “which is contrary to logic&rdquo; (yan nayena virudhyate). Yat is
EM
here taken as an indeclinable. Although māyā is under the shelter of the Lord, there is no opposition raised by her (yat) with regard to Bhagavan (yena). This means that she does not make Bhagavan an object of her opposition. The multifarious colors or movements of [the sun&rsquo;s] reflection cannot oppose or influence the sun orb itself. By this, the defect of partiality or inconsistency (vaiṣamya) [in Bha-
by gavan] has also been dispelled. Intending all this, the very nature of Bhagavan and maya has been implied by the words, &ldquo;This is Bha-m gavān&rsquo;s māyā,&rdquo; as [it was] in verse SB 1.7.10, &ldquo;Such indeed are the equalities of Lord Hari.&rdquo;
Favorable to this understanding, the following unique explanation self-disclosed itself through the implied potency of the linguis- tic principle (sabda-dhvani). (Paramatma Sandarbha 90, Puri Dāsa edition)
1807
To show these characteristics of maya and Bhagavan, Śrī Jīva refers to the prayers of the devas, headed by Indra, to Bhagavan, which the former recited when they were attacked by Vṛtrāsura. The complete texts referred to are given below:

90 Māyā Conditions the Jiva by Her Acintya-sakti
You are without any support (aśarana), without a material body (asarira), and transcendental to the gunas (aguna), yet You create, sustain, and destroy this world made of the gunas by Your own Self without undergoing any modifications and not expecting any assistance from us. This cosmic play of Yours is very difficult to comprehend. (SB 6.9.34)&rdquo;
Furthermore, we are unable to grasp whether, entering these bod- ies generated by the gunas, as a person named Devadatta would reside in a house he himself built, You helplessly accept the merito- rious and unmeritorious outcomes of Your own deeds, or whether, taking pleasure in Your own Self and being self-controlled and of harmonically integrated awareness, You remain as a mere witness. (SB 6.9.35)8
Indeed, neither of these two alternatives are incompatible in You, Bhagavan, who are inherently self-endowed with innumer- able attributes, the Supreme Controller possessing unfathomable glory, free of all phenomena made of maya, and beyond the reach of the arguments of proponents holding perverse views because their hearts are polluted by scriptures that are full of doubts, possi- bilities, ideas, faulty proofs, and sophisms. Indeed, what is impos- sible in You, the absolute transcendence (kevala), who exist while enfolding Your own maya within Yourself, being devoid of both forms? (SB 6.9.36) morb-shoq hono

90 Māyā Conditions the Jiva by Her Acintya-śakti
The essential point of these passages is that Paramātmā is endowed with supralogical powers including that of maya. Consequently, it is possible that the jiva, although referred to as a ruler (iśvara) and liberated (vimukta), loses its autonomy (aiśvarya) and becomes bound by the inert extrinsic potency. Bhagavan&rsquo;s supralogical power is such that even higher beings like the devas are unable to properly comprehend His personhood.hing other, and adopting
Māyā, which is compared to a reflection, cannot contact Bhaga- vān any more than a reflected light can contact the sun. But the same māyā, by its transrational power is able to exert its condition- ing on the pure ātmā. This is the essence of Maitreya&rsquo;s answer to Vidura&rsquo;s questions. In the next anuccheda, Śrī Jīva makes this point even clearer by giving an example.

ŚRI MAITREYA again establishes with the help of an example that in reality the jiva does not undergo such circumstances [i.e., the loss of inherent consciousness and bondage] in its own essen- tial nature, but appears to be subject to them only because of Bhagavan&rsquo;s māyā:
यदर्थेन विनामुष्य पुंस आत्मविपर्ययः ।
प्रतीयत उपद्रष्टुः स्वशिरश्छेदनादिकः ।। २५१ ।।
[It is because of this maya] that the self assumes a positional- ity that is contrary to its inherent nature, just as it appears to a witness of the dream state that he has been beheaded and other similar contradictions, even though such dream cognitions are without reality. (SB 3.7.10)1

loss of inherent identity and bondage of the pure self appear to be the case] even though they are without factual substance (artha). Even though the jiva does not [in truth] undergo any such experience in the three phases of time [past, present, and future], it assumes a positionality that is contrary to its inher- ent nature (ātmā-viparyaya), namely, forgetting its own true self, becoming identified with something other, and adopting the empirical &ldquo;I&rdquo;-sense of being a conditional self endowed with phenomenal characteristics.bood to sauss IT on at sest

This situation is exactly like that of the seer in the dream state. The word upadrastuh (&ldquo;of the witness&rdquo;) means &ldquo;of the jiva,&rdquo; or &ldquo;by the jiva,&rdquo; as the genitive case in this instance is being used for the instrumental. In the dream state, a completely impossible effect, such as seeing one&rsquo;s own head being chopped off, appears to be experienced by the jiva. Certainly his head is not being cut off, nor can anyone witness his own beheading. Rather, it is Bha- gavān&rsquo;s māyā, which superimposes such an effect occurring to some other person in some other circumstance on the witness itself of such an event in the dream state. As is said: &ldquo;Dream objects are, however, products of maya alone, because they are not perceived by anyone other than the dreamer&rdquo; (vs 3.2.3).?
तदात्मनः प्रकृत
Commentary
IT IS NOT POSSIBLE for the jiva to lose its inherent nature, which is consciousness and self-awareness, and become bound by the gunas of prakṛti. Yet, by the power of maya, it does indeed appear to be the case. It is not possible for one to see one&rsquo;s own head lying on the floor because the very eyes used to see are within the head.

Nonetheless, such a thing is possible in a dream, which is a cre- ation of māyā. Māyā makes us see things that are other than the reality. By the influence of this māyā, the jiva appears to be bound, though in fact, it is ever free. In this regard, Śrī Kṛṣṇa&rsquo;s words are highly pertinent, &ldquo;Depictions of the jiva as bound or liberated are relative to the jiva&rsquo;s identification with, or transcendence of, the gunas, which are subordinate to Me, yet such portrayals have no basis in reality&rdquo; (SB 11.11.1). bladão sanse-&ldquo;1&rdquo; Isoisigms odt
There is no real cause of bondage nor is there any specific pur- pose for it. Rather, it is the very nature of avidyā to keep living beings in darkness about reality. This description is offered so that the jivas may ascertain the root cause of their apparent bondage. Once this is recognized, it will be easy to understand the solution tendered in Bhakti Sandarbha (Anuccheda 1).

situated in the sky. In the same way, the properties of the non- self in the form of the material adjuncts, though not existing in the pure self, are taken on by it only as a witness situated in the subtle body (ädhyātmikävastha), namely, the false sense of self (ahankarābhāsa). This simulated or apparent &ldquo;I&rdquo;-sense is here compared to a reflection arising from identification with the māyā-created adjuncts, caused by absorption in the notion that &ldquo;I am verily this [body, etc.].&rdquo; This indicates that the pure self nevertheless perceives those properties as nondifferent from itself. This principle is enunciated by Śrī Kṛṣṇa in the Eleventh

Similarly, it was said, &ldquo;The pure knower of the presentational field merely looks upon (vicaṣṭe) these beginningless modifica- tions of the impure actor, the mind&rdquo; (SB 5.11.12, Anuccheda 1). Here the intent of the prefix vi [in vicaṣṭe] is this absorption [in its material identity].

-92 The Jiva&rsquo;s Apparent Bondage
Therefore, the conclusion is that because Bhagavan has sup- remely powerful, inconceivable intrinsic potencies that belong to His essential nature, He is not affected by māyā, His extrinsic potency, even though it too is powerful and inconceivable. It is concluded, however, that the jiva is affected by maya. rob viris of Waldge
Commentary alt and nevegada boo ton tud ovarit sansulini
SAGE MAITREYA follows the illustration from the previous verse of the non-reality of material bondage by giving another example that graphically depicts how the pure self exists in the body with- out really being influenced by its modifications, though yet appear- ing to be so influenced. This is due to the supralogical power of māyā. Although the whole process is beyond conception, it can be comprehended somewhat through the statements of scripture. bla In the analogy presented by Maitreya, the pure self, the ātmā, is compared to the moon. The conditioned self, the jiva, who is an observer, is compared to the reflection of the moon on water, and the subtle psychical body (adhyatmika) is compared to the water&rsquo;s surface on which the reflection appears. We may further extrapo- late on the example and say that the gross physical body is repre- sented by the lake, the sense objects, by the wind, and the changes in the subtle body effected through sense perception, by the ripples themselves.
The ripples have no bearing on the moon but cause the reflected moon to appear to move, although even the reflection does not do so in reality. It only appears to move because of the displace- ment of the water. Similarly, the pure self is completely free from any changes or influences arising from the body. But the living entity identifies with the ahankara in the subtle body, which is sur- charged by the energy of the self&rsquo;s authentic &ldquo;I&rdquo;-awareness, and so taking on the appellation of jiva, it seems to undergo modifica- tions. This is the play of māyā, as stated above in SB 3.7.9 (quoted in Anuccheda 90).
In his commentary on this verse, Śrī Vallabhācārya presents an interesting purva-pakṣa. He says that it is the self that enters into
587
III The Ontology of Maya Bahiranga-sakti
māyā and not vice versa. There is no possibility of māyā entering into the eternal immutable self. Such being the case, it is the char- acteristics of the self that should be perceived as reflected in māyā and not vice versa. He says that the present verse offers a response to this doubt.
As an aside, Śrī Jiva here explains how it is that maya is able to influence the jiva but not God. Bhagavan has His intrinsic potency, which is beyond logic and supremely powerful, and so He cannot be subdued by the extrinsic energy called māyā, even though it too is powerful and inconceivable, being His own energy. The jiva, on the other hand, lacks this intrinsic potency and thus succumbs to māyā. This refutes the opinion of some people that the jiva has dormant love for Kṛṣṇa. Unadulterated divine love (prema) is an aspect of the intrinsic potency and does not exist in the living entity&rsquo;s essen- tial nature (svarupa). If it did, the jiva would never come under the sway of maya. Moreover, if prema existed within the jiva, it could never be dormant: The phrase &ldquo;dormant love&rdquo; is an oxymoron. el beIn the next anuccheda, Śrī Jiva begins a fresh analysis of Bhaga- van&rsquo;s cosmic play related to the creation of the universe in order to show how He is not influenced by the gunas of māyā.

If He does, then not only would the objection raised earlier1 become verified [that He is influenced by the gunas], but He would also be subject to [the flaw of] favoritism [toward the devas]. If He does not, then all these avataras and their lilās are shown to be not part of Bhagavan&rsquo;s essential nature, and thus the previously accepted conclusion falls to pieces. sbarformA
Commentary

WHILE driving a pole into the ground or a peg into a wall, the more the pole or peg is struck by a hammer, the more firm it becomes, and then it will not shake. This is called sthūņā-nikhanana-nyāya, or the principle of driving in a post. The more objections one can raise in opposition to a theory and then refute, the more firmly that theory is established and indeed becomes unshakable.
Śrī Jiva has already substantiated that Bhagavan is the agent behind the creation, sustenance, and destruction of the cosmos and yet is neither influenced by the gunas nor undergoes any modifica- tion. He now raises further doubts to this position to make it abso- lutely clear. One of the reasons he does so is to uproot any traces of non-theistic leanings from our minds. The non-theists (i.e., the radical nondualists) admit the existence of a qualified God, but in their view, this God is also a product of maya and not a transcenden- tal Being. Therefore, He cannot be the ultimate object of devotion. The author wants to completely rid us of this misconception.
If Bhagavan is the agent of such actions as protecting the devas and killing the asuras, then He must be influenced by the mate-
then rial gunas; otherwise, how could He behave in this manner? More- over, if such were the case, He would not be equal to all, but biased against the wicked and favoring the saintly. Surely such behavior is not possible for one who is beyond the jurisdiction of material

93 The Cosmic Play of Bhagavan T
[That the manifestation of lilā and avatara is] exclusively a dis- play of the intrinsic potency (svarupa-sakti) is shown by Śrī Brahma himself: &ldquo;So that I may remain untainted by my work, even as I create this universe, which is a display of His creative power, may the Lord, who fulfills the wishes of those who take refuge in Him, engage my mind in the divine play He performs, manifesting many transcendental virtues when He descends (grhita-guṇāvatāra) along with His intrinsic potency, Rama&rdquo; (SB 3.9.23)?
गृहीता गुणाः कारुण्यादयो यत्र तथाभूतोऽवतारो यस्येत्यर्थः । तदेवं भक्तानन्दार्थमेव तान् प्रकटयतस्तस्याननुसंहितमपि सुरपक्षपातादिविश्वपालनरूपं तन्मायाकार्यं स्वत एव भवति ।
In this verse, the compound grhita-guṇāvatāra means the avatara of Bhagavan in which He takes on qualities such as mercy. In this way, while manifesting these avatāras exclu- sively for the pleasure of His devotees, the work of His extrinsic potency māyā, in the form of protecting the universe by such things as siding with the suras, occurs of its own accord, even without His conscious inspection.

Commentary
Śri Jiva accepts the second of the two options raised in the previous section, that although Bhagavan personally appears as the avată- ras who descend in the course of His cosmic play, He does not act for the sake of maintaining the universe. This He could do even without descending upon the earth. Merely by His will, He could destroy the miscreants by sending them some natural calamities and in this way accomplish this purpose. But Bhagavan acts for the delight of His devotees. It is for this reason that He evolves the universe, accepts avatāras, and performs pastimes. This is why His activities are called lila, or divine play.
The maintenance of the universe is a concomitant effect of His dalliance with His devotees, just as when one cooks food on a wood fire for one&rsquo;s pleasure, one may also alleviate distress caused by the cold. In the course of His lila, Bhagavan may kill the wicked when they cause a disturbance to His devotees. As a side effect, people in general are benefited, even though the Lord acted only for the devotees&rsquo; welfare.

93 The Cosmic Play of Bhagavan
Śrī Jiva gives a contemporary example of devotees who gather and perform sankirtana for the pleasure of Bhagavan. Although they do so for His delight, it brings auspiciousness to the whole world because of the power of devotion (SB 11.14.24). They may also engage some non-devotees to accompany them in playing musical instruments. These musicians also receive divine blessings, even though this was not their primary intention.ote dai valimi
A person can perform an action to achieve something he lacks or just out of inner delight. We belong to the first category and have no experience of the second state. In contrast, Bhagavan acts out of bliss, like an intoxicated person who dances out of sheer exuberance, and not to obtain joy.

[An objection is raised:] It is not to be conjectured that since Bhagavän gives bliss to His devotees and they to Him, He [or His devotees] must not be self-satisfied; nor that since He gives plea- sure to His devotees while neglecting others, He must be subject to another form of bias. Torw

市町 An objection to the above conclusion may be raised that Bhagavan acts solely for the pleasure of His devotees, indicating that they are not self-satisfied. Moreover, because His devotees also give Him pleasure, it would mean that He Himself is not self-satisfied. What is more, He must be biased because He acts only for the devotees&rsquo; benefit and not for others.
vegada&rdquo;
Śrī Jīva replies that Bhagavan&rsquo;s devotees are fully satisfied, having completely transcendental bodies endowed with viśuddha- sattva. Bhagavan has love for His devotees, just as His devotees have love for Him. This mutual love, which manifests as a desire to please the object of love, is not a sign of personal dissatisfac- tion, but is actually an outcome of the quality of self-satisfaction or love. Only a person who is satisfied within himself can love and serve another without any motive. One who is lacking self- satisfaction will seek personal fulfillment through his actions. Thus, the quality of self-satisfaction and service to the object of

In fact, if Bhagavan did not act to please His devotees, if He were not inspired by their love for Him, it would be a greater defect, as it would show ingratitude to those who have dedicated everything for His sake. This answers the first objection raised by Śrī Jīva.

Since it is proven that Bhagavan, though self-satisfied, is affectionate to His devotees, it naturally follows that He feels delighted by the removal of His devotees&rsquo; pains or by their attainment of well-being. Moreover, the energetic aspect called hladini [the potency of bliss] is the essence of the intrinsic potency (svarupa-śakti), even though the latter is the ultimate essence [of all of Bhagavan&rsquo;s potencies]. And the essence even of that hladini aspect is a very special power, called bhakti. This bhakti, also called rati, ever resides both in Bhagavan and the devotees, extending her functions on both sides. Thus it is said, &ldquo;Bhagavan is He who has devotion for His devotees&rdquo; (bhagavan bhakta-bhaktiman, SB 10.86.59). ve

Consequently, Bhagavan&rsquo;s satisfaction, stemming from the devotion existing in the devotee, is in no way incompatible with His quality of being self-satisfied. Rather, bhakti, being one of Bhagavan&rsquo;s potencies, is both different and nondifferent from the svarupa of the Lord, according to the principle, &ldquo;As they sur- render unto me, so do I also serve them&rdquo; (GITA 4.11).4 Because bhakti appears as if it were a separate energy due to manifest- ing in the heart of a devotee, Bhagavan experiences extreme unprecedented bliss in the form, &ldquo;His devotion is giving Me delight.&rdquo;

In this series, verses 3-5 deny that Bhagavan is ungrateful; verse 6 negates the opinion that He lacks self-satisfaction, and verses 1 and 2 show that bhakti is the essence of hladini, which is in turn the essence of the svarupa-sakti. The state of the devo- tees when this potency enters into them in the form of bhakti is described in verse 5. Therefore, Bhagavan is not subject to the first flaw, that of not being satisfied in His own Self.555 IPPI
Commentary
Śrī Jiva Gosvāmi does not deny that Bhagavan derives bliss by favor- ing His devotees. Still, this is not incompatible with His nature of being self-satisfied. The reason for this is that it is Bhagavan who bestows His own bhakti on His would-be devotees. Bhakti is the very essence of Bhagavan&rsquo;s intrinsic potency. Bhagavan grants this power to His devotee, who is then guided by it. Thus, the recip- rocation between Bhagavan and the devotee is impelled by that intrinsic energy called bhakti, or love, which belongs to Bhagavan.

this 93 The Cosmic Play of Bhagavan
The intrinsic energy is nondifferent from Bhagavan, and thus He derives pleasure from His own energy, not from something external to His svarupa. This does not make Him subject to any lack of self-satisfaction, which would be a defect. Bhagavan is devoted to His devotee, just as His devotee is devoted to Him. Both of them are self-satisfied yet continuously yearn to serve each other, being impelled by love. This indeed is the nature of love, which will be discussed in much greater detail in Priti Sandarbha.
-916
Although Bhagavan is complete in Himself, He yet derives unprecedented bliss by serving His devotee. He becomes com- pletely controlled by the love of the devotee. In fact, this love can even make Him forget that He is Bhagavan and cause Him to expe- rience extreme delight in being controlled by the bhakta. This behavior of Bhagavan is beyond the ordinary conception of God as creator and controller of the cosmos, rewarding piety and meting out punishment for wrongdoing.
bi The verses cited here were spoken by Bhagavan Viṣṇu when approached by the sage Durvasã for protection from the Sudarsana- cakra. Durvāsā had offended the great devotee, King Ambarīṣa. In anger at a perceived slight, he had wanted to kill the king by cre- ating a murderous phantom. Bhagavan&rsquo;s disc, Sudarśana, imme- diately came to the rescue of the innocent king, burned Durvasa&rsquo;s apparition to cinders, and then began chasing Durvasa, who had to flee for his life. The sage approached great devas like Śiva and Brahma for help, but they were powerless against the Supreme Lord&rsquo;s discus. Finally, Durvāsā was obliged to take shelter of Bha- gavān Viṣṇu, the wielder of the disc. In these verses, Bhagavan disclosed the obligation that He feels to protect His devotees.
Bhagavan Viṣṇu declares that He is dependent on His devotees because they have captured His heart by their love. Love is the most powerful charm that can bring even the Supreme Person under control. In Krama-sandarbha, Śrī Jiva Gosvāmī writes that the bliss of Bhagavan is of two types: namely, svarupananda, that belonging to His intrinsic nature; and svarupa-śaktyānanda, that belonging to His intrinsic potency. Out of these, the second is superior to the
603
III The Ontology of Maya - Bahiranga-sakti
first. The second is further divided into two types, called mānasāna- nda, that which pervades the psyche or mental quantum, and aiśva- ryananda, that related to the opulence or majesty of Bhagavan. The first of these pertains to His devotees. daily notioslans
The second of the verses spoken by Bhagavan Viṣṇu implies that the bliss of His loving exchanges with His devotees is superior both to svarupānanda as well as aiśvaryananda. He asserts that without His devotees, He does not covet His own Self or His opulence. In the verse that follows, He states the reason for this - these devo- tees have sacrificed everything for Him. Bhagavan is not ungrate- ful, and so He cannot afford to forget His devotees. The implication of all this is that Bhagavan acts only for the sake of His devotees. Even the acts of creation and so on are undertaken simply for them.

With regard to the second objection [that Bhagavan is subject to favoritism], we say the following: One engages in giving delight to others for two possible reasons - to attain what one desires from the other, or sometimes just to fulfill the other&rsquo;s desire.

means that such misery touches the heart, whether such contact comes from one&rsquo;s own misery or from that of another, because there is no distinction as to whether the heart&rsquo;s relation with misery arises from one&rsquo;s own suffering or that of another. असर्वज्ञतादोषश्च सूर्यदृष्टान्तेनैव परिहृतः प्रत्युत गुणत्वेनैव दर्शितश्च ।

On the contrary, Bhagavan&rsquo;s non-awareness of misery has been shown to be an attribute.

Therefore, let it be admitted that there is some knowledge of misery in general in Bhagavan, though He certainly has no direct experience of misery. Consequently, even though the jīvas are suffering from material miseries even at present in spite of the rulership of Bhagavan - who is utterly capable of all action, all inaction, and all contrary action whatsoever, and who is the crest jewel among all those who are benevolently dis- posed to others to the supreme extent - the flaw of cruelty in Him is denied precisely for this reason [because of His not being directly in contact with their suffering].

The happiness of devotees, however, is indeed a form of Bhaga- vän&rsquo;s devotion, and their misery too is simply a consequence of obstacles in attaining Him. By this, the melting of the heart for Bhagavan is greatly increased, and this is nothing other than

bhakti. Sometimes, as in the case of Gajendra, where the misery experienced is purely of the material variety, bhakti becomes manifest in the same way, through the utterance of expressions such as, &ldquo;He alone is my refuge.&rdquo;
क्वचिद् यमलार्जुनादिषु श्रीनारदादिभक्तानां भक्तिः स्फुटैवेति च सर्वथा दैन्यात्मकभक्त- भक्त्यनुभव एव तं करुणयति न तु प्राकृतं दुःखम - योग्ये कारणे सत्ययोग्यस्य कल्प- नानौचित्यात् । दुःखसद्भावस्यैव कारणत्वे सर्वसंसारोच्छित्तेः ।
TO STED
Sometimes, as in the case of the twin arjuna trees, the devo- tion of devotees like Śrī Nārada becomes manifest. Thus, it is exclusively the experience of a devotee&rsquo;s devotion in the form of humility that impels Bhagavan to compassion, and not material misery, because it is wrong to assume an inappropriate cause when an appropriate one is available. Moreover, if the exis- tence of misery were the sole cause behind His compassion, then the sufferings of worldly existence would have been completely uprooted.bisd

If, however, one argues that material misery is undeniably an indirect cause, then let it be so; there is no harm. Therefore, it is established that in either case, it is only the experience of the devotee&rsquo;s bhakti that impels Bhagavan to bestow delight upon the devotee.

Thereafter, this is to be pointed out: If in spite of directly expe- riencing the happiness and misery of others, Bhagavan were to abandon them and grant happiness to or redress the misery of others instead, then only would He be subject to the charge of being biased. But, Śrī Bhagavan, like a wish-fulfilling tree, is not liable to such accusation, because there is no experience

This idea is expressed by the adjectival compound kalpa- taru-svabhāva that implies the reason why He is to be under- stood as unbiased [in spite of the special dearness of His devo- tees]: &ldquo;Because it is Your nature to respond [in perfect unifor- mity] in the manner of a wish-fulfilling tree.&rdquo; Therefore, You do not have a biased nature though You appear to, and this is extraordinarily wonderful.

Alternatively, any entity at all, endowed with the characteris- tics of a wish-fulfilling tree, is equally approachable by every- one whosoever. [If, however, a person neglects to approach such an entity and so does not receive its favor, the equally disposed entity is not at fault. Bhagavan&rsquo;s devotees, on the other hand, lovingly seek His favor.] Consequently, on seeing Bhagavan&rsquo;s partiality in the form of favoring His devotees, it is understood that even such partiality is the nature of one who is indeed equal to all (samasya). From this it is to be concluded that this kind of partiality is simply inevitable. Thus [in accordance with this alternative explanation], the words avisama-svabhāva should be read and explained as vișama-svabhāva, namely, that He is biased.

III The Ontology of Maya - Bahiranga-sakti
I am equally disposed to all living beings, and so there is no one whom I despise or favor. But those who worship Me with devotion are situated in Me, and I too am established in them. (GĪTĀ 9.29)24
तदेवं तत्तददोषे भक्तपक्षपातस्य स्वरूपशक्तिसारभूतत्वे भक्तविनोदार्थमेव स्वरूपश- क्त्यैव स्वयमेव च तत्तदवतारलीलाः करोति भगवान् ततो विश्वपालनं तु स्वयमेव सिध्य- तीति स्थिते न वैदुरप्रश्नस्तदवस्थः ।
von [avabe ayan imave In this way, Bhagavan is free from these blemishes, and it has been shown that favoring His devotees is an act of the essence of the intrinsic potency (svarupa-sakti). So, Bhagavan person- ally performs all those liläs in various avatāras only through His intrinsic potency and only to give delight to His devotees, whereas the sustenance of the cosmos is thereby accomplished of its own accord. This being established, Vidura&rsquo;s question [as to how Bhagavan can become involved with the gunas and actions of prakṛti, even as a matter of cosmic play (līlā), SB 3.7.2] does not stand.
अत्र देवादीनां प्राकृततया तैः सह लीलायां स्वतस्तृप्तताहानिस्तेषु तदंशावेशादिस्वीका- रेणाग्रे परिहर्तव्या ।
In this regard, the flaw of Bhagavan not being self-satisfied because He performs lilä with the devas, who are material beings, will be cleared later on [in Śrī Kṛṣṇa Sandarbha, Anucche- da 43] by accepting that Bhagavan partially enters the devas with His potency.
Commentary
(2512 This) Thistle 1155
Śrī Jiva now responds to the second objection regarding the accu- sation that Bhagavan is biased. Earlier he established that Bha- gavān acts only to give delight to His devotees, which seemingly implicates Him in bias.

il 93 The Cosmic Play of Bhagavan
Śrī Jiva writes that a person acts to please others for two rea- sons only - either to satisfy his or her own selfish interest or just to bestow welfare without any motive. In the first case, there is no question of partiality to others, since one&rsquo;s interest is only in one&rsquo;s own benefit. When a person acts solely with a motive for personal gain, he can be called selfish but not biased toward oth- ers. Since Jiva Gosvāmi&rsquo;s whole point here is to disprove the charge that Bhagavan is biased, the first case shows itself to be irrelevant to the objection, since there is nothing to disprove. Where selfish- ness alone is the motive for one&rsquo;s actions, partiality is necessarily an impossibility, since the intent is not truly to benefit anyone else. Moreover, selfishness cannot be the case with Bhagavan who is completely self-satisfied. He has nothing to gain, being ātmārāma and äpta-kāma.
bi This leads us to consideration of the second possibility, that in acting for the welfare of others, Bhagavan does demonstrate par- tiality toward His devotees. Śrī Jiva begins his reply to this possibil- ity by first examining the psychology of compassion. He explains that compassion is a transformation of the heart or the mental quantum (citta), which arises when the heart directly contacts the misery of another. Only when impelled by such compassion is a person moved to act for another&rsquo;s welfare. This means that one feels empathy in relation to others&rsquo; misery. The feeling of empa- thy impels one to remove the misery of the person with whom one empathizes.
In the case of Bhagavan, however, such empathy is not possible because He is completely transcendental to all material experience. Feelings of pain and pleasure are modifications of the citta, which is an evolute of prakṛti. Bhagavan is beyond any tinge of māyā, as established earlier. Therefore, He cannot be touched by any mate- rial misery and so cannot feel the pain of others in His heart and be aroused to compassion. As such, there is no possibility of His being biased.
To this argument, one may reply that Bhagavan is omniscient and therefore must know the pains and pleasures of others. This is undeniably true, but Śri Jiva emphasizes that in fact He does not
613
III The Ontology of Maya - Bahiranga-sakti
feel them in His heart. He knows such suffering through the experi- ence of others, not directly. This also means that He is not impelled by compassion, because to be compassionate the pain of another has to touch one&rsquo;s own heart.edio of villainsq lo noitesup on
If one then argues that Bhagavan must not be omniscient because of His absence of awareness of misery, Śrī Jiva says that this too is denied by the example of the sun. The fact that Bha- gavan has no direct experience of the material suffering of the people of the world in no way impedes His all-knowingness, just as the absence of darkness in the sun does not contradict the all- pervasiveness of its radiance. On the contrary, His absence of awareness of misery should be taken as a positive attribute.00M
We can accept that Bhagavan can have some general knowledge of misery, but not the direct experience of it. If Bhagavan were able to experience material misery, then out of compassion He would have delivered everyone from the material world at the mere sight of their suffering. But this has not happened, which proves that He is immune to the experience of material misery. Śrī Jiva says that it is specifically for this reason that Bhagavan cannot be called cruel for not alleviating the suffering of humanity. (Wal) Hasakop
One may question that if Bhagavan is unable to feel the pain of the living beings, then how is it that He is able to feel the pleasure of His devotees? If He acts to give them pleasure, then He must feel it also. If not, how would He know that devotees are deriving pleasure from His actions? The process of experiencing pain and pleasure is the same. If pain is material, so must be pleasure. A l
To this Śrī Jiva Gosvāmī replies that the pain and pleasure of a devotee are not material. Rather, they are both manifestations of bhakti, the intrinsic potency of Bhagavan. A devotee feels happy only by giving pleasure to Bhagavan and His devotees and feels morose if unable to do so. His pain and pleasure are not inde- pendent of Bhagavan. Therefore, Bhagavan experiences only His intrinsic potency while realizing the pain and pleasure of His devo- tee. Thus, the principle that He is unable to experience material pain and pleasure is not violated.

93 The Cosmic Play of Bhagavan i m
Gajendra, the elephant king, whose leg was seized by a crocodile while he drank water from a lake. He struggled for a long time to release himself, but was unsuccessful. Finally, he prayed to Bhaga- vän for help, and the Lord appeared immediately on the spot and severed the head of the crocodile with His cakra. The elephant was suffering from pain, and Bhagavan, being compassionate, released him. This means that Bhagavan was able to empathize with the pain of Gajendra.de
Śrī Jiva replies that it is a fact that Gajendra was in material pain. But Bhagavan did not rescue him out of empathy for his pain, but rather because of his surrender in the form, &ldquo;You are my only shelter.&rdquo; Such surrender is nothing but bhakti, and thus, it is bhakti alone that impelled Bhagavan to rescue him.
Another example of bhakti impelling a bhakta to act in an appar- ently mundane way is found in the Tenth Canto in the story of the twin arjuna trees. In that narration, the sage Narada cursed the sons of Kubera, who were enjoying water sports with young damsels while completely intoxicated and naked. Nārada cursed them to become trees. But it was a blessing in disguise, as he himself said:
Attaining the proximity of Kṛṣṇa after one hundred celestial years, you will return to your own heavenly abode and will have acquired Fardevotion. (SB 10.10.22)25

The two brothers&rsquo; attainment of devotion is clear from the prayers they recited to Kṛṣṇa after He uprooted their tree bod- ies, allowing them to regain their original forms as the sons of Kubera. So, Narada&rsquo;s curse was in fact a blessing: &ldquo;To bless them both, Śrī Nārada pronounced a curse upon them, saying&hellip;&rdquo; (tayor anugraharthāya sapaṁ dasyann idam jagau, SB 10.10.7). gads

Thus, the conclusion is that the compassion of Bhagavan or His devotee manifests as a result of their bhakti and not because of the material suffering of the person so blessed. If their compassion were to manifest at the mere sight of the material suffering of all

the conditioned souls, then everybody would have been blessed by Bhagavan and no one would remain suffering in the universe. Ildwy
It is possible that Bhagavan can come to know of a person&rsquo;s pain indirectly through His devotees. Devotees in this world have experienced material misery, and thus it is possible for them to empathize with the suffering of others. If a devotee is moved to bless such a person and prays to Bhagavan to be compassionate on him, then Bhagavan may bestow His blessings on that person. Thus, Śrī Jiva concludes that Bhagavan acts either to please His devotee or in direct response to bhakti, and not in relation to the work of creating, sustaining, or destroying the cosmos.
stud
Bhagavan is free from the defect of partiality because He is immune to material pleasure and pain. In spite of this, however, He holds His devotees as especially dear, and He loves and serves them exactly as they love and serve Him. In this respect, His nature is said to be exactly like that of a wish-fulfilling tree (kalpa-taru- svabhava), or in other words, a tree from the heavenly realm (sura- druma) [see verses SB 8.23.8 and 10.38.22, respectively]. It is the nature of a wish-fulfilling tree to respond in perfect uniformity with the aspiration of the supplicant. It responds differently not out of bias, but only because the requests of the aspirants are dif- ferent. That is its impartiality. To impose the same reward on everyone irrespective of their desire would be biased.
So, the fact that Bhagavan loves and serves His devotees is sim- ply because they are the only ones interested in such a relation with Him. For Bhagavan not to respond in this manner to His devotees would violate the unbiased nature of a wish-fulfilling tree. Further- more, to remain neutral in regard to all others is simply the appro- priate response to their own neutrality in regard to Him. It is what they choose, and so He graciously responds accordingly. From this perspective too, Bhagavan is to be understood as unbiased. par Alternatively, Jiva Gosvāmi argues, even if we inevitably admit that Bhagavan is partial, because it is the nature of everyone with- out exception, it should not be considered a contradiction in Him because of His transrational opulence. His transrational power can accomplish acts that defy reason, and thus He remains free of any
616
93 The Cosmic Play of Bhagavan
blemish, which in this case is simply our inability to comprehend His actions.
Before Kṛṣṇa appeared on earth, He ordered the devas to appear in the Yadu dynasty (SB 10.1.22). Later on, when He took birth, they assisted Him in His pastimes. If He required the help of the devas, who are material beings, then it may seem like a lack of independence or self-sufficiency on His part. In Kṛṣṇa Sandarbha (Anuccheda 43), it will be explained that these devas were partially empowered by Bhagavan&rsquo;s potency, and thus He was never in fact dependent upon them.
did
Thus, the conclusion is that Bhagavan is complete in Himself. He acts only for the delight of His devotees, while the sustenance of the cosmos is but a concomitant effect of those pastimes with His devotees.

Furthermore, [the fact that Bhagavan does not personally act to sustain the cosmos] does not disprove that the avatāras are endowed with the intrinsic potency. The sole purpose of Bha- gavan is to please His devotees through the absolute transcen- dence of His self-willed lila. Consequently, because whatever He does [in this regard] is without attachment or malice toward all others, He is devoid of bias. Rather, just as the tongue inflicted with jaundice develops an aversion for sugar, so even when non- devotees are subjected to Bhagavan&rsquo;s chastisement, it is simply for their welfare, because it counteracts their wickedness.

The activity of the Lord&rsquo;s māyā is meant for the birth, sustenance, and dissolution of all souls, while His grace is intended to grant them self-realization and cessation of the cycle of birth and death.

According to this statement of Śrī Suka at the end of the Ninth Canto, during the dissolution, the jiva is merged [in Paramātmā] along with its limiting adjuncts (upädhis), and hence, there is no possibility of engaging in meritorious action. Consequently [at the beginning of a new creation cycle], Paramātmā blesses the jiva by generating its adjunctive body so that it can per- form pious acts. This conclusion is in conformity with Śrīdhara Svāmï&rsquo;s commentary on these verses.

Śrīdhara Svāmi comments on these prayers to Śrī Kṛṣṇa offered by the kings imprisoned by Jarasandha: &ldquo;Even though You have descended to protect the virtuous, we are suffering. Why is that? Meanwhile, others like Jarasandha are disobeying even Your own order. Moreover, even those people who are protected by You are suffering from their karma. All this we do not under- stand. The implication here is that neither scenario conforms to the norms of logic.&rdquo;

According to this comment, although Bhagavan&rsquo;s lilä is indepen- dent [i.e., self-willed], it is only māyā, the performer of unac- complishable tasks, which impels and arranges for the activities of the devas and the asuras. It is because of her that the specific actions of the jivas, who are endeavoring separately according to their individual karma, occur, being synchronized with their corresponding auspicious and inauspicious omens. This is seen in the world also. But sometimes when māyā is unable to fol- low the trajectory of the Lord&rsquo;s lila, then only the independent nature of the Supreme Controller becomes manifest.

Now, if some bear malice toward the devotees, then Bhagavan&rsquo;s own hostility toward such people is not a defect, because this is part of what it means to favor His devotees. Rather, because such hostility [toward those who oppose the Lord&rsquo;s devotees] nourishes His affection for His devotee, it is a unique manifes- tation of bliss that is part of the hladini potency. Because of this hostility, Bhagavan awards such people oneness with Brah- man, which is like a desert in relation to the all-exceeding nec- tar of bhakti-rasa, which at every step manifests varieties of condensed bliss. The attainment of oneness with Brahman is acutely opposed to the nectar of devotion to Bhagavan, and [is granted only because it] is the proper treatment for a person whose disease [of enmity toward the devotees or God] cannot be cured by anything else.95eosmenqu or orig

itsine 93 The Cosmic Play of Bhagavan
तदुत्थभगवत्तेजसा तत्स्वरूपशक्तेरपि तिरस्कारेण ध्वंसाभावतुल्यम् “स्वर्गापवर्गनरके- ष्वपि तुल्यार्थदर्शिनः” (भा० ६।१७।२८) इति ।
The prowess of Bhagavan that arises because of this [hostility] keeps His svarūpa-śakti [in the form of bhakti] concealed [from those who are the object of His hostility], and thus [from the devotees&rsquo; point of view, brahma-kaivalya] is equivalent (tulya) to the non-existence of an object after its destruction (dhvam- sābhāva). This equivalence view is expressed in the following statement, “[All those devoted to Śrī Nārāyana] regard all cir- cumstances as equal, whether it be promotion to heaven, libera- tion from material existence, or dwelling in hell&rdquo; (SB 6.17.28).29
न्यायेनान्येषामतीव दुःसहं तेषामपि कामुकानां निकाममनभीष्टमुद्दण्डदण्डविशेषं कुर्व- त्येव भगवति तस्य सर्वहितपर्यवसायिचारित्रस्वभावत्वादेव तत्तद्दुर्वारदुर्वासनामयाशे- षसंसारक्लेशनाशोऽपि भवति ।
According to this principle, Bhagavan awards a very special distinct punishment [i.e., brahma-kaivalya] to them [who bear hatred for God or His devotees], which is, however, exceedingly intolerable for others [i.e., the devotees], and which is unde- sirable even for those seeking sense pleasure. By such punish- ment, their complete material misery in the form of formidable heinous desires is also destroyed, because Bhagavan&rsquo;s nature is such that His actions culminate in everyone&rsquo;s welfare.
यः खल्वभेदोपासकानामतिकृच्छ्रसाध्यः पुरुषार्थः क्वचिच्च परमार्थवस्त्वभिज्ञानां नरकनिर्विशेषं तेषां कामिनां तु निकाममभीष्टं विकीटानामिवामेध्यं स्वर्गविशेषं तेभ्यो ददाति स परमेश्वरः । अत एवोक्तं नागपत्नीभिः “रिपोः सुतानामपि तुल्यदृष्टेर्धत्से दमं फलमेवानुशंसन्” (भा० १० | १६ | ३३) ।
Parameśvara offers such people even that which is aspired for by those who worship the Absolute with an exclusive sense of oneness and which is attainable only with great ardor. Some- times He even sends them to a special heaven that is intensely sought by those who cherish sensual enjoyment. Such a desti- nation is, however, indistinguishable from hell for those who

know the Supreme Reality, and hence, it is filthy like worms in stool. Therefore, the wives of the Kaliya snake said: &ldquo;You regard Your enemy as well as Your sons as equal, and You chastise while anticipating only auspicious results [for the recipients of such punishment]&rdquo; (SB 10.16.33).30

In those scriptural passages, however, where it is learnt that even [wicked persons] such as Pūtanā attained the same desti- nation as the most exalted devotees (uttama-bhaktas), it is per- fectly clear that these incidents occur exclusively through the glory of imitating such devotees. This has been described in statements such as, &ldquo;Even Putanã along with her family attained You merely by dressing in the guise of a mother&rdquo; (SB 10.14.35).31 अथ यदि केचिद् भक्ता एव सन्तो भक्तान्तरेषु कथञ्चिदपराध्यन्ति तदा तेनैवापरा- धेन भक्तेषु भगवति च विवर्तमानं द्वेषबाडवानलज्वालाकलापमनुभूय चिरात् कथञ्चित् पुनः सद्वेषेणापि भगवत्संस्पर्शादिना सपरिकरे तदपराधदोषे विनष्टे स्वपदमेव प्राप्नुवन्ति न तु ब्रह्मकैवल्यं भक्तिलक्षणबीजस्यानश्वरस्वभावत्वात् । तेषु भगवतः क्रोधश्च बालेषु मातुरिवेति । तस्मात् सर्वं समञ्जसम् ।
If, however, some devotees somehow offend other saintly devo- tees, then by that very offense they experience the misery of hatred toward devotees and Bhagavan for a long time, like the intense scorching of an underwater volcano, which is diamet- rically opposed [to their prior devotional disposition]. There- after, if they should somehow come into contact with Bhaga- vän again, even if only in the guise of a devotee [like Pūtanā],

all their defects arising from their offenses are destroyed, and they along with their associates attain His abode. They do not attain oneness in Brahman (brahma-kaivalya), because the seed of bhakti is of an imperishable nature. Bhagavan&rsquo;s anger toward them is like that of a mother toward her children. Therefore, everything is consistent.co

Bhagavan Himself is equal to everyone, beloved to all, and the well-wishing friend of every living being, O brāhmaṇa. So why did He kill the sons of Diti on behalf of Indra as if He were biased [in Indra&rsquo;s favor]? (SB 7.1.1)32
परमात्मत्वेन समः सुहृत् हितकारी प्रियः प्रीतिविषयो भगवान् । एवं सति साम्येनै- वोपकर्तव्यत्वेन प्रीतिविषयत्वेन च सर्वेष्वेव प्राप्तेषु कथं विषम इव दैत्यानवधीत् ? विषमत्वमुपलक्षणम् । असुहृदि वा प्रिय इव चेति ॥ 700
By virtue of His feature as Paramātmā, Bhagavan is equal to all (sama), a friend to all (suhrt) - meaning one who acts for their welfare and beloved (priya), meaning that He is the object of everyone&rsquo;s love. Since He is thus equally disposed to everyone, and the well-wisher and object of love for all, how could He slay the asuras as if biased against them? The question raised here about bias [vişamatva, i.e., the negation of sama] is used in an indicative sense (upalakṣaṇa) [suggesting that the ques- tion could have been rephrased substituting the other qualities named in the first line of the verse]. For example, &ldquo;[How could He slay the asuras] as if He were not their well-wishing friend (asuhrdi) or as if not beloved to them (apriya)?&rdquo;

Commentary
III The Ontology of Maya - Bahiranga-śakti
goolagadt The second objection raised by Vidura was that if the avataras and their activities of sustaining the creation are not directly per- formed by Bhagavan, then they cannot be part of His svarupa, which would contradict the conclusion established in Bhagavat Sandarbha. This has already been answered at the end of the previous section (Anuccheda 93.5) where Jiva Gosvāmī said that Bhagavan, personally appearing as the avataras, acts only to give delight to His devotees and only through the agency of His intrinsic potency (svarupa-śakti).
On the question of partiality, Śrī Jiva further adds that even when Bhagavan chastises or kills a wicked person, He does not do so out of a negative bias, because such actions are auspicious or beneficial to the wicked person receiving His punishment. Jiva provides an example from Ayurveda, according to which, jaundice is caused by a disturbance in the bodily humor called pitta. This diseased condition alters the affected person&rsquo;s perception of taste, making sweets appear as bitter.
At the same time, eating rock-sugar is said to be one of the cures for jaundice, and once cured, the patient will again be able to savor its sweetness. Eating rock-sugar may seem like a punishment to the sick person because of its bitter taste, but the end result is ben- eficial. Similarly, it may appear that Bhagavan is punishing the wicked when He chastises them, but His actions culminate in the purification of their evil tendencies.
When Bhagavan appears on earth, it seems as if He is also under the jurisdiction of the extrinsic energy. Otherwise, how is it that asuras are able to oppose Him, and that His devotees are tormented by the asuras? This makes it seem as if the devotees also undergo the outcome of their karma.
Śrī Jiva responds that although Bhagavan&rsquo;s intrinsic potency is beyond the jurisdiction of māyā, who can accomplish unimagin- able tasks, she nonetheless behaves in a way that makes Bhagavan&rsquo;s pastimes appear to be under her control. He gives an example to make it clear. Everyone is working under the influence of their
624
-93 The Cosmic Play of Bhagavan r
past karma. When some meritorious or unmeritorious reactions are due to occur to a person as an outcome of past karmas, one may see corresponding omens. The omen itself is not the cause of the good or bad results, merely an indicator; yet, one may think it is instrumental in bringing about the happy or miserable situation. A common omen is a black cat crossing one&rsquo;s path. This is supposed to bring some inauspicious outcome. People usually get upset at the cat, but the cat is not instrumental in bringing about the result. If the omen is true, it is only an indicator of the future event.
Similarly, Bhagavan is engaged in His lilä, and māyā follows it simultaneously like an omen. To an ignorant person, it appears as if māyā is causing His pastimes. Sometimes, however, māyā is unable to keep pace with the lilä. In such situations, the supreme independence of the lila becomes explicit. Śrī Jiva here gives an example of an occasion when this occurred.
Śrī Kṛṣṇa&rsquo;s guru was Sandipani Muni. When Kṛṣṇa&rsquo;s educa- tion was over, He approached His guru to offer him guru-dakṣiņā, the offering made by a student to his teacher as an act of grati- tude. Sandipani requested Krsna to bring his son back to him, after he had been lost off the Arabian Sea coast at Prabhasa and was presumably dead. pabigo Tad salvo lepoito
Kṛṣṇa went to Prabhasa and learned that the boy had been killed by a demon named Sankhasura. He went to Yama, the lord of death, and demanded that he produce His teacher&rsquo;s son. Such a thing is not possible from any conventional point of view. How could a dead person be brought back to life? The child&rsquo;s body had already been devoured by the demon, so how could he be returned? Such a pas- time does not fit within the jurisdiction of maya; the cosmic matrix of materiality is unable to cope with such an anomaly or to accom- modate it in any way as an operation feasible within its hierarchy of laws.al sjovsb voivas due to and engedd ass

Śrī Jiva explains that pastimes that demonstrate the super- independent nature of Bhagavan are rare. In most cases, His acts do appear to correspond to the law of karma, and thus, there is no apparent contradiction in them, such as an action not followed by any result, or a result attained without any action undertaken to
625

achieve it. In a similar fashion, it is seen that even great devotees seem to undergo suffering like ordinary people as if undergoing the outcome of past karma.ne
If someone bears malice toward Bhagavan&rsquo;s devotees, then He protects them by chastising the wicked. Bhagavan&rsquo;s anger in such cases is also a manifestation of the intrinsic potency and only increases His bliss. He grants such offenders brahma-kaivalya because their disease of envying the devotees is beyond any other cure. This is befitting because they do not warrant a place in Bha- gavan&rsquo;s abode due to their envious nature. So, Bhagavan shears them of their envy, but does not grant them bhakti. As such, the only suitable destination for them is brahma-sayujya. pint bran
Alternatively, He may grant them a place in heaven, which is desired by materialistic people ignorant of their ultimate welfare. Devotees consider both these positions equivalent to hell. Their interest is simply in executing devotion. If they were somehow pre- vented from that, then heaven or hell would make no difference to them. In fact, they would prefer hell to brahma-sayujya, even though this state is attained by Advaitavādīs only after undergo- ing great austerities, because there is absolutely no possibility of devotional service there. They consider it as nothing more than spiritual suicide.
We to
So, Bhagavan does not punish a devotee by giving him brahma- sayujya, even if he should become envious of, or inimical to, another devotee. This is because the seed of devotion, which is inde- structible, has already taken root in him. As a result, no devotee could ever desire brahma-säyujya.
chBhagavan makes such envious devotees suffer the conse- quences of their offensive acts and eventually, after the defect of envy has been erased, they are reinstated in their identity as devo- tees. Bhagavan&rsquo;s chastisement of such envious devotees is only to rectify them, like a mother&rsquo;s anger toward her ill-behaved children. Her intention is never to harm the child, but only to correct his or her mischievous behavior.
Thus, it is concluded that Bhagavan acts only for the welfare and pleasure of His devotees. The acts of creation, etc., are concomitant

to that, occurring through the agency of the extrinsic potency. Bha- gavän is like the philosopher&rsquo;s stone, which is equally disposed to all objects, but turns the iron that comes into contact with it into gold. van Viu is even-minded and equally disposed to all, so how
Bhagavan is altogether free from bias. Because He is utterly devoid of the experience of material miseries, His awareness can- not be directly aroused to compassion at the plight of materialistic people. Additionally, He grants brahma-sayujya or heaven to those who envy His devotees. He sometimes grants devotion even to the wicked, just because they imitate the dress or mood of a devotee. And, finally, He punishes those devotees who envy other devotees, but only to rectify the former. Shaft tefe &amp; we
In the last part of this anuccheda, Śrī Jiva Gosvāmi refers to another episode that deals with the same topic of the apparently biased behavior of Bhagavan. After hearing that two sons of Diti were killed by Varahadeva and Nrsimha, King Parikṣit was intrigued by the behavior of Bhagavan. He presented his doubt to his teacher, Sukadeva. In his question, he lists three qualities of Bhagavan that imply His unbiased nature. His question continues in the next two anucchedas.
Hise Sponat
Vidura also voiced a similar doubt, &ldquo;How can Bhagavan, who is beyond the gunas of prakṛti, engage in the acts of creation, sus- tenance, and dissolution of the cosmos?&rdquo; This reinforces the fact that this is a significant doubt that perplexes the devotees of Bha- gavān. It is for this reason that Śrī Jiva deliberates on it at length. In fact, this dilemma is one of the troublesome topics discussed in Vedānta. Śrīmad Bhagavatam, being an elucidation of Vedanta,
low surgique naturally tackles this subject elaborately.

MOREOVER, [the general rule is that] one favors the person through whom one&rsquo;s own purpose is accomplished, and attacks with animosity those whom one fears. But such is not the case with Bhagavän. So, Parikṣit says:

94 Bhagavan Has No Enemies
Anuccheda 104. King Parikṣit&rsquo;s questions (SB 7.1.1-3, Anucchedas 93- 95) to sage Suka were made after he heard that Bhagavan Viṣṇu had favored Indra and killed the sons of Diti (SB 6.18.23). He knew that Bhagavan Viṣṇu is even-minded and equally disposed to all, so how could He behave in a biased manner? In this verse, he states the reason for his conviction. Bhagavan is transcendental to the gunas; therefore, nothing material can please or displease Him. Moreover, He is bliss personified; thus, He has nothing to gain from anyone. For these reasons, there is no possibility that He could be biased. The king concludes his question in the next anuccheda.

Commentary
phulani oals vads durabow as its nevened to HEARING ABOUT elevated devotees of Bhagavan is even more nour- ishing to bhakti than hearing about Bhagavan Himself. The reason for this is that we can relate to the lives of devotees more easily than that of Bhagavan. The devotees of yore underwent birth and the normal tribulations of human life. They did not simply appear, as did Bhagavan, endowed with all majesty. They faced problems and had to behave and struggle like sädhakas. Bhagavan, on the other hand, is omnipotent, accomplishing everything by His mere will. Whatever hardship He may appear to undergo in His earthly mani- festation is all His divine play (līlā). For this reason, hearing about devotees provides greater inspiration in a practical sense. It also teaches modern practitioners how to face various life challenges in
a way that is commensurate with devotion. navegada to embarq e as dous as web robikatholg sdr ylaman 259) novegada nohovah aan al doidw

sentence? Here again it is being shown that since these sto- ries are sung by [the great sages], their sole purpose is to give pleasure to the devotees.
com sale, it is being indicated that Sukadeva&rsquo;s answer to Parileşit will culminate in the conclusion that Bhagavan does Commentary the sake of His devotees alone and not for other purpose.
IN BHAGAVAT SANDARBHA (ANUCCHEDA 47), it was established that the divine play of Bhagavan is a manifestation of His intrin- sic potency. The recitation of His lilä is also a manifestation of the intrinsic potency. Thus, hearing such narrations has the power to purify one&rsquo;s heart. This recitation is even more potent when per- formed by great devotees. Therefore, although the adjectival com- pound paramam punyam (&ldquo;supremely purifying&rdquo;) should modify hares caritam (&ldquo;the exploits of Śri Hari,&rdquo; in SB 7.1.4), Śrī Jiva com- ments that it is the manner in which great sages like Nārada recite the activities of Hari that makes such narrations supremely purify- ing (paramam punyam). The word punya can mean an &ldquo;auspicious act&rdquo; or a &ldquo;purifying act,&rdquo; because it can be derived either from the verbal root √pun, &ldquo;to perform an auspicious act,&rdquo; or from the root √pūñ, &ldquo;to purify.&rdquo;

THEREAFTER, in keeping with the inferred meanings [discussed in the commentaries to the two previous verses], śrī śuka begins answering the king&rsquo;s question:
की निर्गुणोऽपि ह्यजोऽव्यक्तो भगवान् प्रकृतेः परः ।
स्वमायागुणमाविश्य बाध्यबाधकतां गतः ॥ २८४ ॥
di Although devoid of the material guņas, unborn, unmanifest, and beyond prakṛti, Bhagavan enters into the gunas of His own maya and assumes the roles of oppressor (bädhaka) and toppressed (badhya). (SB 7.1.6)1
यस्मात् प्रकृतेः परस्तस्मान् निर्गुणः प्राकृतगुणरहितः । तत एवाजो नित्यसिद्धः । अत एव च अव्यक्तः प्राकृतदेहेन्द्रियादिरहितत्वान् नान्येन व्यज्यते इति स्वयम्प्रकाशदेहादिरित्य- र्थः । ततश्च प्रकृतिगुणोत्थरागद्वेषादिरहितश्चेति भावः ।
Because Bhagavan is beyond prakṛti, He is nirguna, devoid of the material gunas. Therefore, He is unborn (aja), meaning that He is eternally self-existent (nitya-siddha). Consequently, He is also unmanifest (avyakta), meaning that since He is devoid of a

material body, senses, and so on, He cannot be revealed by any- thing or anyone else. This is to say that His body, etc., are self- luminous (svayam-prakāśa). The idea is that He is thus free from attachment and hatred, which arise out of the material gunas.
एवमेवम्भूतोऽपि स्वेषु भक्तेषु या माया कृपा तत्रोचितो यो गुणो लीलाकौतुकमयविशु- द्धोर्जितसत्त्वाख्यस्तमाविश्यालम्ब्य भगवान् नित्यमेव प्रकाशितषड्गुणैश्वर्यः सन् ।

Although He is as above described, Bhagavan enters into (āviśya), or in other words, takes support of, the quality (guna) corresponding to His own maya, which here refers to His com- passion toward His devotees. So, the quality that He takes sup- port of, specifically refers to the pure and powerful state of unalloyed being (viśuddha-sattva), which is of the nature of all- entrancing play (kautuka-maya-lila). Such is the case because Bhagavan is always manifest with His six divine opulences.
एतदप्युपलक्षणं कदाचिददित्यादौ जातः सन् लोकेन्द्रियेषु व्यक्तोऽपि सन् बाध्यबाध- कतां गतः । निजदृष्टिपथेऽपि स्थातुमसमर्थेषु अतिक्षुद्रेषु देवासुरादिषु स्वसाहाय्यप्रति- योद्धृत्वसम्पादनाय स्वयं सञ्चारितं किञ्चित् तदंशलक्षणमेव तेजः समाश्रित्य बाध्यतां

This description, too, is simply an indicator [meaning that it fur- ther entails the following circumstance]. At times on the occa- sions of His appearance, such as after taking birth from Aditi and becoming manifest to the senses of people in the world, He assumes the roles of oppressor (badhaka) and oppressed (badhya). The devas and asuras are extremely insignificant beings who are unworthy even to stand in His line of vision. But in order to produce allies to assist Him and enemies to fight with Him, He infuses a minute portion of His own power into both of them, and taking shelter of that power, He becomes both the oppressor [in the form of the asuras] and the oppressed [in the form of the devas].

This means that to make the play of battle more interesting, He sometimes infuses more prowess into His opponents than He manifests in Himself and at that time experiences the condi- tion of being oppressed or defeated (badhya). On other occa- sions, however, He infuses less prowess into them and so experi- ences the condition of being the oppressor (badhaka), or in other words, the victor.

According to the Viśva-prakāśa dictionary, māyā can mean either &ldquo;mercy&rdquo; (kṛpā) or &ldquo;deceit&rdquo; (dambha). Here, although the second meaning (deceit) could also be applied, it is not at all anticipated or relevant [to the context], because this section was begun only to show that Bhagavan performs His lilā to grace His devotees, and it will be concluded in the same manner. This too is the harmonious conclusion of scripture. Moreover, if it is admitted that the Lord conducts His liläs through the agency of a māyā that is deceptive in nature, it will only land us in greater difficulty.
तस्माद् भक्तविनोदैकप्रयोजनकस्वैरलीलाकैवल्येनान्यत्र रागद्वेषाभावान् नात्र वैषम्य- मिति भावः । अत एव बाध्यतामपि यातीति बाधकतया सहैवोक्तम् । तथा निजस्व- रूपशक्तिविलासलक्षणलीलाविष्कारेण सर्वेषामेव हितं पर्यवस्यतीति सुहृत्त्वादिकं च नापयातीति ध्वनितम् ॥
The sense is that because Bhagavän performs His unrestrained lilä only for the delight of His devotees and is neither attached nor hateful toward all others, there is no bias in Him. There- fore, it is stated that He experiences the condition of being the oppressed also (badhya), along with that of being the oppres- sor (badhaka). In this way, because Bhagavan manifests His lilā through the operations of His own intrinsic potency (svarupa- śakti), it culminates in everyone&rsquo;s benefit, implying that Bha- gavan&rsquo;s qualities, such as being the well-wisher of all, remain intact.

Commentary
III The Ontology of Maya - Bahiranga-sakti
HERE ŚRI JIVA GOSVĀMI EXPLAINS the secret behind Bhagavan&rsquo;s divine play (lilä). Although the Lord is transcendental to the gunas of prakṛti and thus absolutely free from any bias, yet out of love for His devotees, He descends into the material world and behaves as if under the jurisdiction of māyā. Sometimes He fights with asuras and takes the help of the devas. At times He even accepts the condi- tion of being defeated by the enemy. All these pastimes are enacted for the delight of His bhaktas. Devotees relate and remember His acts and derive immense pleasure from them.
Śrī Jīva assigns a less common meaning to the word māyā in this verse. Generally it is used to mean &ldquo;material nature,&rdquo; but here he takes it to mean &ldquo;mercy.&rdquo; Thus, from this perspective, the meaning of the verse is that by His grace (māyā) on His devotees, Bhagavan behaves externally as if a conditioned being under the influence of karma. The word guna would then mean the quality corresponding to that grace (māyā).
So, the quality that Bhagavan takes support of in conducting His play is a function of His own intrinsic nature of unalloyed being (viśuddha-sattva) and not that derived from the extrinsic potency. Śrī Jiva explains that this is so because Bhagavan is always mani- fest with His six divine opulences. From this we can understand that even when Bhagavan mixes with the people of this world, His divine majesty is always present, even though hidden from view.
The popular meaning of māyā as &ldquo;the material energy&rdquo; or &ldquo;deceit&rdquo; (dambha or chala) is unsuitable here because that would contradict the opening and concluding statements of this section from Bhagavata Purana. Suka began his reply with verse 7.1.4, in which he said that the character of Bhagavan is wonderful and increases bhakti. That would not be possible if Bhagavan&rsquo;s pastimes were under the influence of the material energy, maya.bnd) roz
This first chapter of the Seventh Canto serves as an introduction to the story of Prahlada, which will be concluded with the following benedictory verse:
638
in 98 Bhagavan Behaves as if Conditioned
To Anyone, who reverently hears this auspicious story of Visnu, con-off taining the account of His prowess, and then recites it, will be liberated from the bondage of karma. (SB 7.10.46)2
The verse that follows states that such a person enters into the abode of Bhagavan Viṣṇu. Both these verses imply that such a per- son becomes a devotee of Bhagavan. This is possible only if these līlās are manifestations of His intrinsic energy. It is for this rea- son that Śri Jiva interprets māyā as mercy and not as the extrinsic energy or deluding potency.
Śrī Jiva also uses the principle of gati-samanya to support his conclusion. This means that such an interpretation of the word māyā is consistent with other scriptures. For example, while commenting on the phrase atma-mayaya (lit., &ldquo;through My own maya&rdquo;) in Bhagavad Gitā (4.6), Śrī Viśvanatha Cakravarti glosses the word māyā as cit-śakti-vṛtti, or &ldquo;a function of the intrinsic potency of consciousness.&rdquo; Śrī Baladeva Vidyabhuṣaṇa also glosses it as jīvānukampā, or &ldquo;compassion for the living beings.&rdquo; he mate
According to the verse under discussion, Bhagavan not only assumes the role of oppressor but also that of the oppressed. This also supports the conclusion that He is not biased. If He were biased, then why would He sometimes adopt an inferior position and appear to be in need of the devas&rsquo; help, or even sometimes allow Himself to be defeated by the enemy?
In a play, even a physically stronger person may be defeated by a weaker person. This does not mean that the defeated per- son is really inferior in strength or fighting ability. When Kalaya- vana attacked Krsna, the latter ran away as if afraid of the former. Kṛṣṇa was bound with ropes by mother Yasoda. He also became the chariot-driver of Arjuna. When Ravana kidnapped Sītā, Rāma was weeping and wailing like an ordinary henpecked husband. He took the help of monkeys to attack Rāvana. Vamanadeva approached Bali to beg three steps of land. All these incidents demonstrate

The gunas beginning with sattva are of prakṛti only and not of the Self. This means that all the gunas that belong to the Self, Parameśvara, are ever expanding, and thus are not the same as the gunas of prakṛti. This is expressed in Visnu Purana: &ldquo;The three material gunas do not exist in Iśvara&rdquo; (VP 1.9.43), and, &ldquo;The potency of bliss (hladini), the potency of being (sandhini), and the cognitive potency (samvit) exist without any deviation only in You, the support of everything. You are completely free from the material gunas, and thus, the potencies that give rise to mate- rial happiness, distress, and a mixture of both, are non-existent in You&rdquo; (VP 1.12.69).*

THE WORD SATTVA-GUNA is generally used to denote material sattva, one of the three gunas of prakṛti. But this term is also used to refer to the intrinsic potency of Bhagavan, which is specified as viśuddha-sattva. The characteristics of the two sattva-gunas are different. The first, being part of prakṛti, undergoes modifications in time, whereas the second is immutable. The material gunas do not exist in the svarupa of Bhagavan. Bhagavan instills a portion of

viśuddha-sattva into the devas and others, in accordance with the needs of His lilä. Therefore, His divine acts are not under the influ- ence of karma. Thus, the defect of &ldquo;the disablement of the results of performed karma (kṛta-hāni) and the enablement of the results of unperformed karma (akṛta-abhyagama)&rdquo; does not apply.
This latter phrase sums up the nature of how the gunas of prakṛti operate. They are always vying for supremacy, and as such they grow through mutual suppression. This is stated in Bhagavad Gitā:
O Bharata, sometimes sattva predominates, subduing rajas and tamas, and sometimes rajas predominates over sattva and tamas. Similarly, at other times, tamas overpowers sattva and rajas. (GĪTĀ 14.10)5
Hräsa is decline, and ulläsa is growth. The verse states that they cannot occur simultaneously, because the action of one cancels that of the other. In the case of Bhagavan, however, He nourished sattva and rajas at one and the same moment. He infused sattva in the devas, by which they could assist Him, and rajas in the asuras, by which they could combat Him. The nourishment of one guna was not dependent on the deprivation of the other. Hence, there was excitation (ullāsa) of both gunas simultaneously.
This type of nourishment does not contravene the law of karma, which holds that every action must yield a corresponding result. Consequently, the defect of disabling performed karma and enabling unperformed karma (kṛta-hāny akṛtābhyāgama) does not apply, because the gunas of prakṛti nourished by Bhagavan induce the devas and asuras to perform corresponding acts of assistance and opposition for which they incur the requisite outcome.
If, however, Bhagavan were to intervene directly, without impelling the appropriate gunas in the devas and asuras, then there would be a disruption of some of the results of performed karma (kṛta-häni) and the bestowal of some results for which no action was performed (akṛta-abhyagama). The next verse, cited in the

THEREAFTER, Śrī Suka demonstrates the devas&rsquo; ability in the matter of assisting Bhagavan and that of the asuras in fighting with Him. Additionally, when sattva or one of the other gunas becomes ascendant, then Bhagavan&rsquo;s lilā appears to be under the influence of that particular guna. After first mentioning this, Śri Suka then denies it:

Bhagavan, to whom the qualitative movements of time conform, enables the gods and sages when sattva is supreme, the asuras when rajas is predominant, and the yakṣas and rākṣasas when tamas prevails. (SB 7.1.8) 1

III The Ontology of Maya - Bahiranga-sakti
When sattva is predominant, Bhagavan enables (abhajat) the gods and sages. This means that He infuses His prowess delim- ited (upadhika) by sattva into their bodies, which are consti- tuted of that nature, by which He makes them able to assist Him. It is similarly to be explained that when rajas is predominant, He infuses His potency delimited by rajas into the asuras, and when tamas is prevalent, He instills His potency delimited by tamas into the yakṣas and rakṣasas. He, thereby, makes it pos- sible for the yaksas and others to combat Him and for the gods to incur defeat, while showing Himself to be similarly [defeated]. In this way, it has been shown that Bhagavan undergoes victory and defeat for the sake of the diversity of His lilă meant to nour- ish the joy of His devotees. This is described in the narration of the churning of the Ocean of Milk:

In this case, too, it was only for the diversity of His lila that He so entered. A doubt is now raised: If Bhagavan is subject to the influence of the time in which a particular guna is predominant, is the independent nature of His lilā not lost thereby? And does not this excessively close relation with that guna clearly reveal that He is partial?

In response, Śrī Śuka says, &ldquo;[Bhagavan is He] to whom the qual- itative movements of time conform&rdquo; (tat-kālānuguna), mean- ing that it is time itself, corresponding to the period of promi- nence of the various gunas, that conforms to Him [and not the other way around]. The compound here functions as in the construction bhagavat-sarana, &ldquo;[one] whose shelter (sarana) is

This means that time itself, corresponding to the material gunas, is always under the control of Bhagavan, for while He plays in complete independence, time is set into motion (pravartya- māna) by māyā, which is ever subservient to Him (nityam eva tad-anugatikaya). In this respect, time is a specific functional capacity of māyā (sva-vṛtti-viseṣa-rupatvena) that impels the beginningless flow of the aggregate karma of the cosmos (anādi- siddha-pravaham tam jagat-karma-samudayam prerya), in accor- dance with His will alone (tad-anusareṇaiva). That time is a function of māyā was said in SB 10.63.26: &ldquo;Time, destiny, and so on &hellip; all these constitute Your maya&rdquo; [see Anuccheda 53].

Alternatively, the meaning of tat-kālānuguņa is as follows: Bha- gavan is He whose qualitative aspect is time, which is ever obe- dient to Him and which is characterized by the power of inde- pendent action undertaken exclusively for the sake of blessing His devotees.

volitional act (cesta) of the Lord. This is expressed as follows: &ldquo;O friend of the unmanifest (prakṛti), this phenomenon of time, by which the cosmos is impelled, is Your own volitional act (ceṣṭā)&rdquo; (SB 10.3.26).

In both explanations, it is equally evident that Bhagavan is not subservient to time. Lord Kapila also confirmed the same, &ldquo;Time is the twenty-fifth evolute [of prakṛti] &hellip; Time is said to be the prowess of the Purusa from which fear arises&rdquo; (SB 3.26.15- 16).5 Here Kapila has stated both opinions: that time is a manifestation of maya and that it is a quality of the Purușa. sal -nova) moltom ofni dea al amb sonǝbnaqsbai ste अत्र तस्य चेष्टाप्रभावस्य भक्तविनोदायैव मुख्या प्रवृत्तिः । गुणोद्बोधादिकार्यं तु तत्र स्वत एव भवतीति तत्र प्रवृत्त्याभास एव । ततश्च पूर्वोऽशः स्वयमेवेति स्वरूपशक्ते- रेव विलासः परस्तदाभासरूप एवेत्याभासशक्तेर्मायाया एवान्तर्गतः । “योऽयं कालः”

The primary function of Bhagavan&rsquo;s volitional prowess [as time] is solely for the delight of His devotees. The function of activat- ing the gunas occurs automatically as a by-product, and thus, it merely appears to be His own action. Therefore, the prior aspect [i.e., of pleasing the devotees] is directly His own will and is thus a manifestation of the intrinsic potency (svarupa-śakti), whereas the other aspect is a mere semblance (abhasa) of His will and is thus counted as a component of māyā, which is itself the very power of appearance (abhasa-śakti). In SB 10.3.26, the

mention of the division of time into units, such as a nanosecond (nimeșa), and so on [which belongs to the mayic feature of time], is only to say that the two aspects are ultimately nondifferent.

In view of the above, [the phrase tat-kālānuguna] can be explained in the following way: Just as a servant under the direction of another servant (bhrtya) is called anu-bhṛtya, so a guna that is merely a semblance (abhasa) [of power] and that is subservient to another guna that directly embodies power is called an anu-guna of the latter. So, too, time is an anuguna of the gunas [i.e., of the periods of prominence of sattva and so on] and not a direct guna of such a Lord.

OF THEIR OWN ACCORD, the devas do not have the power to assist Bhagavan, nor do the asuras have the power to fight with Him. But when Bhagavan appears in this universe, He acts as if He is also under the influence of the gunas and the law of karma. In reality, however, Bhagavan infuses His potency into the devas, and thus they appear to assist Him, when in fact it is His own potency in them that is providing the support. Similarly, Bhagavan infuses the asuras with His potency so that they can oppose Him. At appro- priate moments, He empowers either the devas, the sages, or the asuras. Thus, it is in appearance only that His acts resemble those of conditioned beings.
An example of this is seen in the episode of the churning of the Milk Ocean by the devas and asuras. Once the devas were attacked by the asuras and were utterly defeated. They approached Brahma, who advised them to take shelter of Bhagavan Viṣṇu. Headed by Brahma, the devas prayed to Visņu. Being pleased by the devas, Vişņu appeared before them and counselled them to churn the Milk
649III The Ontology of Maya - Bahiranga-sakti
Ocean to extract nectar. He instructed them to make a truce with the asuras and to convince them to help in churning the ocean.)
The devas followed Visņu&rsquo;s advice. When, however, they began churning the ocean, they quickly became discouraged at the ardu- ousness of the task. It was then that Bhagavan empowered them with His potency. Śrī Viśvanatha comments in this regard that Bha- gavān empowered the devas with sättvika potency, the asuras with rājasika, and the snake Vasuki with tamasika power. Vasuki was used as the churning rope. He was, therefore, infused with tama- sika power, so that he would not feel pain while his body was being rubbed against Meru Mountain, which was used as the churning rod.
It is for this reason that Bhagavan&rsquo;s actions are called lilă, or play. A father may play with his young son and allow him to ride on his back or may lose to him in a mock fight. This does not mean that the son has overpowered the father; it is just a game to give pleasure to the son. Similarly, for the delight of His devotees, Bha- gavān performs various pastimes, līlā. Therefore, Śrī Kṛṣṇa says that His birth and actions are divine (GĪTĀ 4.9).
Kṛṣṇa does not conform to time, but time manifests the quali- ties suitable for His lilä. Therefore, tat-kälänuguņa means, &ldquo;He to whom time conforms in accordance with the gunas of prakṛti.&rdquo; Time is a constituent of māyā. This was stated by Jvara, who was generated by Lord Siva, in his prayers to Śrī Kṛṣṇa (see Anuccheda 53).
In the opinion of some, time is not a function (vṛtti) of māyā but a volitional act (cesta) of Bhagavan. The meaning of the com- pound tat-kälänuguna would then be &ldquo;Bhagavan is He whose ini- tiative is time, the function of which is to give pleasure to His devo- tees.&rdquo; While acting to give pleasure to the devotees of the Lord, time, being an operation of Bhagavan, also inspires the corresponding material gunas.

[Bhagavan] appears like light (jyoti) and other elements, and [thus,] He cannot be discerned from the bodies (sanghätät) [of the devas and asuras]. It is only the wise who, after careful delib- eration, ultimately come to know that the Self is situated in the self. (SB 7.1.9)1

Although [Bhagavan] enters into the devas and asuras by a por- tion of His prowess, He cannot be discerned from their bodies (sanghätät), which are intermixtures (sammiśratvät) [of vari- ous tattvas], meaning that people in general are unable to rec- ognize Him. Nevertheless, the wise (kavayah), namely, those of

highly refined discrimination, ultimately churn [the evidence] and, through the logic of negation, come to the conclusion that the assistance of Him [in the case of the devas] or the combat- ing of Him [in the case of the asuras] is categorically impossible. They consequently come to intuit the Self (ātmānam), the Sup- reme Immanent Regulator (Iśvara), as situated in the self (atma- stham), namely, to have entered into their individual bodies through His integrated portion.
तत्र हेतुगर्भो दृष्टान्तः – यस्मात् तत्तेजः ज्योतिरादिपदार्थ इवाभाति द्रष्टृष्विति विशेषः ।
Śrī Śuka gives an example that contains the reason why Bhaga- van&rsquo;s power remains unseen: because His prowess appears like light (jyoti) and other elements [whose own respective powers are also transmitted to other media]. The difference is that the transmission of the power of fire or light, and other elements is discernible to the common observer [whereas in the case of Bhagavan, the infusion of His power is intuited only by those of highly refined wisdom].
अयमर्थः – यथा नेदं मणेस्तेजः पूर्वमदर्शनात् किन्तु तदातपसंयोगेन सौरं तेज एवात्र प्रविष्टमिति सूर्यकान्तादौ तृणादिदाहेन तदनुभविषु तदा भाति । यथा च पूर्ववदेव वायो- रयं गन्धः पार्थिव एव प्रविष्ट इति तेष्वाभाति तथात्रापीति ।
The meaning is as follows. By observing the power of a magni- fying glass to set dry grass ablaze, it appears to those experi- enced in the matter that the radiance does not belong to the gem itself [i.e., a magnifying glass or lens], because it was not seen there previously. Rather, they recognize that it is the radiance of the sun that entered it through contact with sunlight. And, as implied by extension of the very same previous example, the fragrance in the air (vayu) is from the properties of the earth that have entered into it [and not from the air itself]. The same is also the case here [i.e., the power of the devas to assist Bhaga- vän or of the asuras to combat Him is not their own but is due to the transmission of a portion of His own power].th asingo

Alternatively, [this verse is a response to the following doubt:] It has been concluded that Bhagavan plays only with His own potency, which He has invested in the devas and asuras. So why is it observed that He also plays with them? In response, Suka speaks this verse [SB 7.1.9].
and. Sri Jiva co
यथा चक्षुरादिज्योतिर्भिः स्वांशे रूपमात्रेऽपि प्रकाश्यमाने गन्धादिगुणपञ्चका मृदेवासौ प्रकाशत इति प्रतीयते यथा च कर्णादिनभसा स्वांशे शब्दमात्रेऽपि गृह्यमाने दुन्दुभिरेवा- साविति प्रतीयते तच्च तत्तद्गुणानां सम्मिश्रत्वादेव भवति न वस्तुतः ।
[The examples of light and so on are now interpreted differ- ently.] Although it is only by the power of light (jyoti) embed- ded in the eye that light&rsquo;s own corresponding portion, as color or form (rupa), becomes perceptible, yet it appears outwardly to the observer that the earth itself [i.e., the physical objects constituted of the earth element], with its unique property of fragrance and all the other properties belonging to the five elements, is the manifestor of the [perceived] color or form. Similarly, although it is only by the power of the sky element (nabhas) present within the ear that the sky&rsquo;s own correspond- ing portion, as sound (sabda), becomes detectable, it appears to the observer that it is a kettledrum itself [or some other instrument] that is the manifestor of the sound.
This happens only because all these properties of form, sound, and so on, belonging to their source elements, get mixed up with the objects that appear to manifest them, but in reality they belong to the source elements and not to the objects through which they are apparently discerned.
तथा कवय आत्मानमीश्वरं तत्तत्सङ्घातस्थत्वेनान्यैरविविक्तमपि आत्मस्थं स्वांशतेजोभि- रेव क्रीडन्तं जानन्तीत्यर्थः ॥

within the intermixture of their respective bodies (sanghātāt). The wise know that it is only with a portion of His own intrinsic power [transmitted into the devas and asuras] that He conducts His play.

IF BHAGAVAN&rsquo;S POTENCY is present in the devas and asuras, then why is it not perceived directly? This is the question answered in the present section. Śrī Sukadeva says that although the power of Bhagavan is transmitted to both the devas and the asuras, it appears to be their own. Śrī Jīva Gosvāmi explains this with the example of a convex lens. If a convex lens is held in the sunlight, then it concen- trates the solar energy at the focal point, and if some combustible substance, like paper, is held at that point, it will burn. A person completely ignorant of the actual physics involved, who does not know that the lens is concentrating the sun&rsquo;s rays at the focal point, would think that it is the lens that has the power to burn. But the fact is that the sun&rsquo;s rays are setting things alight and not the lens. When the lens is not held in the sunlight, it cannot burn. Similarly, the devas are able to assist Bhagavan, or the asuras to oppose Him, only by the infusion of His own power. Without it, they have no such capacity.
元
A further doubt is raised. In the previous sections, it was explained that Bhagavan plays only with His own intrinsic potency, svarupa-sakti. But to external appearances, it would seem that He also plays with the devas and asuras. How is that?ndada
Śrī Jiva responds to this with an example. Form or color is a property of light, which is perceived by the eye, a manifestation of light also. So, it is the power of light that is the manifestor of form. Yet, from the perspective of conventional experience, when an object is seen with the eye, one says that it is the object itself that is perceived and not just its color or form. This is so because the form is mixed with the object that contains other qualities also, such as fragrance, which is the unique quality of the earth element.
654
101 The Invisible Presence of Bhagavan
Thus, although the eye can detect only color, which is the charac- teristic of light, one claims that what is seen is the earthly object. This is the sense of the word sanghata in the verse.
Similarly, sound is a property of the sky, a portion of which is situated in the ear. When a sound is heard, it is the power of the sky situated in the ear that perceives it. But one does not say that it is only the sound that is perceived. Rather, one declares that one is hearing an instrument that produces the sound. Śrī Jiva con- cludes that it is only because the properties of form, sound, and so on, belonging to their source elements, become compounded (sanghata) with the objects that manifest them that a common per- son is unable to discern them as distinct from these objects. The reality is something quite different.
The word sanghata literally means &ldquo;a collection,&rdquo; &ldquo;a group of things put together,&rdquo; or &ldquo;an aggregate.&rdquo; In this verse, it refers specifically to the body, which is a combination of various tattvas, such as earth and water. Śrī Jiva Gosvāmi glosses it as &ldquo;a mixture&rdquo; (sammiśra) and employs the ablative case in the sense of reasoning or cause. The sense is that Bhagavan&rsquo;s potency is mixed with the other tattvas, and hence, it is not possible for a common person to discern it.
In the same way, it appears that the devas are capable of assist- ing Bhagavan and the asuras of combating Him. In reality, how- ever, it is a portion of His own intrinsic power, transmitted into. them, that accomplishes the acts of assistance or opposition. But because this potency interpenetrates the mixture (sanghata) in the form of the bodies of the devas and asuras, it remains imperceptible, and thus a common person believes that Bhagavan is interacting specifically with them. Consequently, it is with His own intrinsic potency alone that Bhagavan interacts and not with the devas and asuras directly. An ordinary person is unable to discern this truth. The wise devotional transcendentalists, however, endowed with intuitive insight, can perceive that Bhagavan is immanent within the individual self and engages with His own potency alone.
In the next section, Śrī Jīva shows that not only the act of main- taining the universe is an outcome of Bhagavan&rsquo;s play with His

devotees, but even the acts of creation and dissolution are carried out specifically for their sake.

IN THIS WAY, Śukadeva has concluded that the purpose of Bhaga- van&rsquo;s own personal lilās, such as fighting with the asuras, is only to give delight to the devotees, and that the sustenance of the cos- mos (palana) occurs automatically as a subsidiary outcome from it. Now, in order to remove all doubts in regard to the purpose even of Bhagavan&rsquo;s other acts, such as glancing upon prakṛti at the onset of creation and withdrawing His glance during the period of dissolution, Sukadeva affirms the nondistinction of Bhagavan&rsquo;s three acts [of creation, sustenance, and dissolution] by applying the principle of extrapolation [atideśa&rsquo;]:
यदा सिसृक्षुः पुर आत्मनः परो रजः सृजत्येष पृथक् स्वमायया । सत्त्वं विचित्रासु रिरंसुरीश्वरः शयिष्यमाणस्तम ईरयत्यसौ ॥ २८९ ॥

The word yada, &ldquo;when,&rdquo; here refers to the specific time in which Bhagavan&rsquo;s own volitional act [of creation] is characterized. The words esa paraḥ mean &ldquo;this Supreme Regulator, Parameśvara.&rsquo; The compound sva-mayaya, &ldquo;by His māyā,&rdquo; in this case means &ldquo;out of compassion for His devotees.&rdquo; The bodies (purah) that He desires to create refer to the physical forms of the [not yet per- fected] practicing devotees (sādhakas) from the previous cycle of creation. That He desires to create such forms for Himself (ätmanaḥ) means that He longs to make them the seats of His own abiding. Since the practicing devotees were dissolved in Him along with prakṛti [during the period of dissolution], He glances at prakṛti in order to bring about their appearance.

[So, when Parameśvara desires to create forms for His own abiding,] at that time, impelling this jiva-mäyä potency by a semblance of His power in the form of His own volitional act, He brings forth rajas, as in the previous creative cycle.

Alternatively, the word prthak can be taken as referring to time, qualified by the demonstrative pronoun eșa, &ldquo;this.&rdquo; The meaning would then be that it is specifically this factor of time - which is distinct and functions under the jurisdiction of māyā - that impels [the respective gunas]. In this case, the [other] pronoun asau would also refer to time [and not to Parameśvara].

Thereafter, when Parameśvara desires to sport in the manifold bodies [of the practicing devotees], which are characterized by diverse qualities with corresponding devotional resolve (mati), then He [or time, in the case of the alternate explanation] man- ifests sattva. Then again, when He desires to sleep, being joined together with them, He [or time] impels tamas. Thus, all of His acts whatsoever, such as creation, are propagated only for the sake of His devotees.

This has been accepted by Śrīdhara Svāmi also in his commen- tary on the third chapter of the Eleventh Canto (SB 11.3.3):3 &ldquo;For what purpose did He create? [The verse answers] sva-mătr- ätma-prasiddhaye [for the complete fulfillment of the individual self who worships Him]. The compound sva-matṛ is explained as follows: svam means &lsquo;Himself,&rsquo; and matṛ, being derived from the verb ma, means &rsquo;to know completely&rsquo; or &rsquo;to worship.&rsquo; So, the compound refers to one who worships Him.

Paramātmā&rsquo;s sleep, referred to here [in sB7.1.10], sometimes means yoga-nidrā, or “the yogic sleep of supraconscious being,” of the puruşăvatära in the causal ocean of dissolution, and some- times it means &quot; entering into Bhagavān.” Although Parames- vara is situated in all jivas as the indwelling witness and regu- lator (antaryāmi), yet, because He is not attached to them, He is indeed as good as not situated there at all. Such is not the case with His devotees, however, because He is attached to them. Moreover, it is not His desire that is instrumental in the mat- ter of His attachment or non-attachment to different jivas, and, hence, the explanation given above carries more weight.

lovers IN THIS VERSE, Śrī Suka states that Paramātmā evolves the cosmos specifically to revive the opportunity of serving Him for those liv- ing beings who were practicing devotees in the last cycle of cre- ation and were merged within the body of Paramātmā prior to the new creation cycle. At the end of the previous creation, the cos- mos is dissolved, and all living beings are merged into the body of Mahāviṣņu. These living beings include the devotees of Bhaga- vän who have not yet attained perfection in bhakti. To give them a chance to perfect their devotion, Paramātmā brings forth the cos- mos by unsettling rajo-guna. Thus, the creation is caused by the bhakti of His devotees. From this, it is understood that the acts of sustenance and destruction of the cosmos are also performed for the sake of His devotees.

Applying the characteristics of a topic under discussion to asilf another subject is called atideśa, or extrapolation. In the previ- ous sections, it was explained that Bhagavan performs His lila in the universe solely for the pleasure of His devotees, and the act of sustaining the universe happens as a concomitant effect of that. Here the same principle is being extended to the other two cosmic acts also, i.e., the creation and dissolution of the universe.
1919
One may raise the objection that Paramātmā is situated in everyone&rsquo;s heart, so what is so special about devotees among all living beings? Why do you stress that the creation is evolved specifically for the sake of the devotees?
Śrī Jiva Gosvāmī replies that it is a fact that Paramātmā is situ- ated in every jiva; yet, He is attached only to the devotees. People may live in a city with millions of people, but their affection is only

for their family and friends. They are said to be living with them and not with the rest of the population. Similarly, though Param- ātmā exists in all, yet, He lives only with His devotees. Toward oth- ers, He remains neutral. We may travel in a plane or a train and sit next to someone, but we do not feel a connection with that per- son, and thus we do not say that we traveled with him or her. But if we travel with a relative, we say that we traveled with that person. Physical proximity is unimportant without a sense of relation.
Bhagavan Nrsimhadeva appeared from a pillar, but He is not called the pillar&rsquo;s child. On the other hand, Kṛṣṇa is called Yasoda- nandana, or &ldquo;the son of Yasoda,&rdquo; even though He was not born from her. Nrsimhadeva had no love toward the pillar, but Kṛṣṇa loved Yaśodā even more than Devaki, who gave birth to Him.
Śrī Jiva also significantly points out that Paramātmā&rsquo;s attach- ment or non-attachment to the devoted or the non-devoted, respec- tively, is not due to His own desire, but rather it is due to the dif- fering dispositions of the jivas with whom He reciprocates accord- ingly. So, again it is not His desire that is primary in bringing forth the creation but the desire of the practicing devotees to per- fect their service to Him. This adds more weight to the argument that the creation is enacted simply for their sake. It also fortifies the principle discussed earlier that Bhagavan is impartial to living beings, just like a wish-fulfilling tree.
In the verse, when it is said that Paramātmā creates (srjati) rajas or sattva, it means that He makes them predominant, since they are eternal constituents of prakṛti and, hence, uncreated. In the next section, Śrī Jiva concludes this topic.

IN THIS WAY, after describing the creation and dissolution as a subsidiary topic, [Suka] concludes the main theme of his dis- course by again explaining cosmic sustenance in one and a half

O ruler of men (nara-deva), the Supreme Immanent Regulator (Isa), whose actions are true (satya-kṛt), manifests time, which was proceeding in unison with prakṛti and puruşa as [their] sup- port. O King, that which is known as time apparently fosters the armies of the gods, who are predominated by sattva, and apparently destroys the asuras, the enemies of the gods, who are predominated by rajas and tamas. Consequently, time&rsquo;s con- troller [Paramātmā], too, who is dear to the suras and whose fame is greatly expansive, also apparently fosters the suras and destroys the asuras. (SB 7.1.11)1

&ldquo;One whose actions are true&rdquo; (satya-kṛt) means that while He Himself is the manifestor of actions that are true from the high- est level of reality through the play of His intrinsic potency alone, He reveals [srjati, i.e., vyañjayati] time in the form of His own volitional act (ceṣṭā). In what manner of action was time engaged? It was &ldquo;proceeding in unison with pradhana and puruşa,&rdquo; meaning that it was in progression along with the unmanifest prakṛti (avyakta) and the aggregate of jivas that are to be brought forth. It was doing so only to assist the practic- ing devotees (sādhakas), who are related to prakrti and purusa, and to provide support for those portions of His own potency that had been infused in the devas. Therefore, it is only through its proximity [to them] that time is said to be the support of those states of both prakṛti and puruşa and the cause of their manifestation.

A doubt is raised. If Iśvara has no purpose to achieve, then why is it that He never includes the asuras within His fold and fights alongside the devas instead? In response, Sukadeva refers to Him as sura-priya, “He who is dear to the suras,” meaning He whose beloved devotees are present among the suras. It is only because all those devotees support the suras, who are predomi- nantly in sattva, that Bhagavan is also supportive of them [since He is a dedicated follower of His devotees]. Sometimes, however, when the devas offend a great devotee like Bṛhaspati, then due to this impurity their godly nature is covered, and thus the devo- tees among the suras as well as Bhagavan do not support them. Therefore, it was said [in sB7.1.8, Anuccheda 100], “Bhagavān assists the devas when sattva is supreme.&rdquo; and
ननु कथं तेऽपि तान् नानुगच्छन्ति ? तत्राह “रजस्तमस्कान्” इति । अत्यन्तभगवद्बहिर्मु- खताकरयोस्तयोर्गुणयोररोचकत्वादेवेति भावः ।
But then why do the asuras not follow the devotees as well? In answer, the verse describes them with the adverbial clause,
665

&ldquo;who are predominated by rajas and tamas.&rdquo; These two gunas make them completely averse to Bhagavan and His devotees, and thus, they have no liking for them.

In the scenario just described, the objection may be raised that in regard to the asuras, Bhagavan always extends only chas- tisement alone, which would be unjust. The verse replies with the name Uruśrava, meaning that Bhagavan is He whose fame (śrava) is paramount or widespread (uru) to the ultimate degree [extending, therefore, even to the asuras], as described in verses such as the following: &ldquo;Out of enmity, kings like Śiśupāla, Pauṇḍra, and Śälva constantly thought of Krsna&rsquo;s gait, play, glance, and so on, even while lying down on their beds or sitting comfortably. Consequently, their minds were imprinted with the shape of Kṛṣṇa&rsquo;s form, and ultimately they attained the lib- erated state of similarity with His form. What then can be said of those whose minds are attached to Him&rdquo; (SB 11.5.48)?2t ti ai

And: &ldquo;How astonishing indeed! Although the unvirtuous she- demon Pūtanā, the sister of the demon Baka, applied deadly poi- son to her breast and suckled Śri Krsna with the intent of killing Him, she was granted a position corresponding to a foster- mother. Consequently, could there be anyone more merciful than Him, whom we should approach for shelter&rdquo; (SB 3.2.23)?3

The conclusion is that Bhagavan certainly blesses the asuras also.

Commentary

nl.8.tani BHAGAVAN IS CALLED SATYA-KRT, which means that His creation is satya, or real, and not mithya, or illusory. He is the propellor of time through His intrinsic potency. Time regulates the evolu- tion of prakṛti. Bhagavan impels time and thus causes the evolution of prakrti without directly coming into contact with her. He does so to assist the devas who have been imbued with a portion of His potency, and especially to bless the devotees in the world who are still striving to attain perfection. Thus, His real purpose is to give pleasure to His devotees. Other operations, such as the sustenance of the universe, take place only as a side effect of this.
Bhagavan&rsquo;s actions are comparable to that of a king. When a king or a head of state goes somewhere on official business, then many secondary things happen as a result of his visit. The roads may be repaired, gardens maintained, lighting fixed on the streets, and so on. The same occurs on a cosmic scale in the case of Bha- gavan&rsquo;s appearance. He comes only to give delight to His devotees, but as a concomitant effect, the universe is maintained.
zale
His
As for His slaying the unrighteous, even that is a boon for them. The two verses referred to here (SB 11.5.48 and 3.2.23) describe that the asuras killed by Kṛṣṇa attained liberation, which is so rarely achieved, and this too in spite of being inimical to Him. Kings like Śiśupāla and Paundraka attained sarūpya-mukti, and Pūtanā attained the position of a foster-mother. Even brahma-jñānīs cannot attain such a position.
Śrī Sukadeva began answering King Parikṣit&rsquo;s query in SB 7.1.7. The fundamental principle, stated in the subsequent verse (SB 7.1.8), is that Bhagavan acts only for the sake of His devotees, whereas the functions of the creation, sustenance, and dissolution of the cosmos are carried out solely to facilitate that purpose. He does not personally deal with His extrinsic energy. Time (kāla) is the medium through which He executes His functions in regard to the extrinsic potency. Time is His subtle effort, or in other words, His volitional act (cestā).

In the next three and a half verses from the same series, Śrī Śuka expands on this principle. Then, in the last one and a half verses, he concludes by reaffirming what he stated in SB 7.1.8. In the next anuccheda, Śuka provides an example of this principle, referring to the story of Prahlada.

Then, in the last one and a half verses,
A CONCLUSION becomes explicit by providing a lucid example. The history of Jaya and Vijaya, who were cursed by the four Kuma- ras, was discussed in Bhagavat Sandarbha (Anuccheda 79); see also Priti Sandarbha (Anuccheda 7). They became the formidable asuras, Hiranyakasipu and Hiranyākṣa. Hiranyākṣa was killed by Śrī Varahadeva when he challenged Him, while the latter was engaged in rescuing Mother Earth.
Prahlada was a great devotee of Bhagavan Viṣṇu and the son of Hiranyakasipu. Hiranyakasipu was slain by Nrsimhadeva because he had been torturing his innocent son Prahlada on account of the latter&rsquo;s devotion to Visņu. In both instances, fierce duels broke out between Bhagavan and the two brothers. From such stories, it is exceedingly clear that Hiranyakasipu and Hiranyākṣa were able to oppose and fight Bhagavan solely because they had been empow- ered by Him. Bhagavan killed both of them to protect His devotees, i.e., Mother Earth and Prahlada. His appearances as Varahadeva and Nrsimhadeva were both conducted for the sake of His devotees. all Both Hiranyakasipu and Hiranyākṣa were ultimately reestab- lished in their eternal service as doorkeepers in Vaikuntha. Exter- nally it may appear as though Bhagavan was biased against the asuras, but in reality He was playing exclusively with His own potency, which He had invested in them for their pleasure and for the pleasure of His other devotees.
The conclusion is that Bhagavan is neither biased nor cruel, even though He sometimes appears to be so. He is like a cloud that showers rain without any discrimination. Different trees, plants, and creepers, however, produce different types of fruits and flowers while utilizing the same water. Similarly, Bhagavan&rsquo;s grace is equally available to everyone at all times, but the devas are responsive to it because of their sattvika nature, whereas the asuras, being influenced by rajas and tamas, are indifferent to it

that Narada recounted the history in question to affirm that Bhaga- van&rsquo;s killing of the daityas was not a matter of siding with the suras, but rather an instance of His mercy on His devotees who had taken a demoniac birth due to a brahminical curse. He further says that Bhagavan slayed them in spite of being entirely free from malice toward them. So, his commentary precisely confirms the points brought out by Jiva Gosvāmī in the last few sections.
In the next section, Śrī Jīva Gosvāmī begins a lengthy analysis to show that the purpose of Srimad Bhagavata Purana is to establish Bhagavan.

IV Determination of Bhagavan as the Subject of Bhagavata Purāṇa
Thus, Brahman, Bhagavan, and Paramātmā have been explained. In this regard, what has been depicted is in fact the threefold manifestation (tri-vyuha) of the One Absolute. At other times, scripture may alternately refer to the Absolute as being fourfold (catur-vyuha), beginning with Vasudeva [Sankarṣaṇa, Pradyu- mna, and Aniruddha]. This distinction too [of the One indivis- ible Absolute as being threefold or fourfold] is not improper, since the inclusion of one manifestation by another may be described either from the perspective of nondifference or from that of difference, depending on the intention of the inter- preter. This is expressed in the Nārāyaṇīya section of the Mokṣa-dharma:
1201
ixa as al sau stavegada एकव्यूहविभागो वा क्वचिद् द्विव्यूहसञ्ज्ञितः । त्रिव्यूहश्चापि सङ्ख्यातश्चतुर्व्यूहश्च दृश्यते ॥ २९३ ॥ इति ।
The Onefold Absolute [i.e., constituting a single undivided o whole] is sometimes described as twofold, elsewhere as three- fold, and in other places still as fourfold.

statement, this Maha-purana is a natural commentary on the Brahma-sūtras, and it is expressly for this reason that Vyasa- deva introduces the book with this first verse, which assumes the form of the meaning of the opening sutras.
तत्र पूर्वम् “अथातो ब्रह्म जिज्ञासा ” ( ब्र० सू० १|१|१) इति व्याचष्टे “तेजोवारिमृदाम्” इत्याद्यर्धेन । योजनायां प्राथमिकत्वादस्य पूर्वत्वम् । तत्र ब्रह्मजिज्ञासा इति व्याचष्टे “परं धीमहि&rdquo; इति ।
The first of the Brahma-sutras, &ldquo;Now, therefore, inquiry should be made into the Absolute Truth&rdquo; (athāto brahma-jijñāsā, vs 1.1.1), is explained by the second half of the verse, beginning with tejo-väri-mṛdām. This part of the verse [which contains the subject, param] logically comes first, because the subject is to be treated first through syntactical readjustment. In this regard, [Vyasa] clarifies the meaning of inquiry into the Absolute Truth, brahma-jijñāsä, by the words param dhimahi, &ldquo;Let us meditate on the Supreme.&rdquo;
परं श्रीभगवन्तं धीमहि ध्यायेम । तदेवं मुक्तप्रग्रहया योगवृत्त्या बृहत्त्वाद् ब्रह्म यत् सर्वा- त्मकं तद् बहिश्च भवति । तत् तु निजरश्म्यादिभ्यः सूर्य इव सर्वेभ्यः परमेव स्वतो भवतीति मूलरूपत्वप्रदर्शनाय परपदेन ब्रह्मपदं व्याख्यायते । तच् चात्र भगवानेवेत्यभिमतम् । पुरुषस्य तदंशत्वान् निर्विशेषब्रह्मणो गुणादिहीनत्वात् ।
&ldquo;The Supreme&rdquo; (param) refers to Śrī Bhagavan, and dhimahi means &ldquo;let us meditate upon.&rdquo; In this way, by its unrestricted primary meaning, Brahman, which is the totality due to its immensity (bṛhatva), is also beyond everything. As the sun is in fact identical with its rays and also superior to them, Brah- man is naturally everything and yet distinct from and superior (param) to everything. To disclose this original feature of the Absolute, the word brahman is being explained by the word param. The intention here is that Brahman is nothing other than Bhagavan, since the Purușa, or Paramātmā, is but His part, and unqualified Brahman is devoid of attributes, such as form. [Therefore, the word param cannot refer either to Paramātmā or Brahman.]

Śrī Rāmānujācārya has also commented, &ldquo;The term brahman is applicable to anything that possesses the quality of greatness (brhattva, from the root √brmh), but it primarily denotes that which, by its essential nature as well as by its qualities, pos- sesses this greatness to an infinite degree; and such is only the Supreme Controller of all (sarveśvara)&rdquo; (Śrī-bhāṣya 1.1.1).

The Pracetas also sang, &ldquo;Because there is no limit (anta) to Your opulences, You are therefore celebrated as the unlimited (Ananta)&rdquo; (SB 4.30.31).10 For this reason, although Bhagavan has unlimited forms, each with their own enchanting beauty, it is also implied that He has one supremely astonishing primary form [para] that is the support of all the others. Once it has been established in this manner that the Absolute [para] is intrinsi- cally endowed with form, it is thereby concluded that the Abso- lute is none other than Bhagavan, having forms such as Visņu, by the very same reason of superiority [paratva], because He alone is described as superior [para] to Brahma, Śiva, and so on.

ŚRĪ JIVA GOSVĀMI HAS EXPLAINED that Bhagavan is free of all bias. He is like a rain cloud that showers water on all without discrimina- tion as to rich or poor, pious or sinful. Nourished by rain water, a lemon tree produces sour fruit, whereas a mango tree yields sweet fruit. The difference in the taste of various fruits is not because of

any discrimination on the part of the rain water but on the nature of the different trees. Similarly, Bhagavan is equal to all. Every- body experiences pleasure or pain strictly in accordance with their own deeds and not due to any partiality on the part of Bhagavan.
In this way, Śrī Jiva has explained the three manifestations of the One Supreme Reality (tattva), i.e., Brahman, Paramātmā, and Bhagavan, mentioned in the vadanti tat verse (SB 1.2.11) on which this treatise is based and which was begun in the first anuccheda of Bhagavat Sandarbha. Brahman and Bhagavan were discussed in Bhagavat Sandarbha, and Paramātmā is elucidated in the present so il madi olalonos stebin all of nest volume,onion-

Now Jiva begins an analysis of the Bhāgavata Purāņa to show that of these three manifestations of the Absolute, Bhagavan is sup- reme and that He is the chief subject matter of this work. It is for this reason that Śrimad Bhagavata Purana, which was established as the topmost authority on the self-disclosure of the Absolute, is so-named. The word bhāgavata means &ldquo;of or relating to Bhagavan&rdquo; (bhagavata idam). Thus, the name of this Purana means that which explains the form, nature, attributes, actions, associates, abode, and devotees of Bhagavan.
To show that Bhagavan is the main subject of the Bhagavata Purāṇa, Śrī Jīva analyzes the six criteria that indicate the prin- cipal topic or subject matter of a book. The first item of these six is the concurrence of its opening and closing statements. In the Bhāgavata Purana, both of these verses contain the same for- mula - satyam param dhimahi - &ldquo;Let us meditate on the Supreme Truth.&rdquo; Śrī Jiva begins his analysis of the first verse by showing that the Supreme Absolute Truth is Bhagavan, and not Brahman or Paramātmā.
According to the Garuda Purana statement cited here (discussed in Tattva Sandarbha, Anucchedas 19-21), the Bhāgavata Purāna is an explanation of the Brahma-sutras by the author of the sutras him- self. Although the explanation of the sutras that the Bhāgavatam provides is not carried out in a sequential manner as in a tradi- tional commentary, it discloses their real meaning. As an indicator

of this, the very first verse opens with the famous words of the sec- ond sutra (janmädy asya yataḥ). Additionally, it also contains the meaning of the first Brahma-sutra, which is elaborated in the sec- ond half of the verse. The reversal of the order is a result of its poetic composition, but the proper order is restored when the sentence is syntactically rearranged in prose form.
The word param in the first verse is identified with the word brahma found in the first sutra (athāto brahma-jijñāsā). Śrī Jīva says that if the unconditioned or primary meaning (mukta-pragrahaya yoga-vṛttyä) of the word brahman, indicated by the word param, is taken to its ultimate conclusion, then it can refer only to Bhagavan. Mukta-pragraha means &ldquo;unrestricted,&rdquo; like a horse without reins that will run at top speed until it tires out and comes to rest. Usu- ally the word brahman is used to refer to the formless qualityless Absolute. But the unrestricted meaning of the word is Bhagavan.
To show this, Śrī Vyasa has used the word param as a synonym of brahman in the first verse. The word brahman means &ldquo;the great- est,&rdquo; which is the same import of the word param (supreme). To be the greatest or the supreme implies that there must be some- thing inferior to it. This ultimate Reality must have some qualities by virtue of which it is supreme or superior. This cannot be unqual- ified Brahman, because Brahman is the Absolute divested of form, attributes, and action. It also cannot be Paramātmā, who is only a partial manifestation of Bhagavan, because a part cannot be supe- rior (param) to the whole that encompasses it. Therefore, the only remaining alternative is Bhagavan. Śrī Rāmānujācārya&rsquo;s testimony is also given to support this meaning of Brahman.moz-lum
Moreover, the word param cannot refer to devas such as Śiva and Brahma, because Viṣṇu is superior to them. This was established in Bhagavat Sandarbha (Anucchedas 37-38) and in the beginning of Paramātmā Sandarbha (Anucchedas 8-13).

The use of the verb &ldquo;meditate&rdquo; also leads to the understanding that Bhagavan has a form because: (1) Meditation can be per- formed most easily only on an object with form; (2) Medita- tion on the formless is naturally inferior, because when an easy method to attain the goal of human life is readily available, one would not be inclined to seek out a difficult path; (3) Because the worshiper of the Absolute with form has been determined to be the most advanced in yoga (yuktatama).

Inquiry into Brahman has no purpose other than meditation on that very Absolute. One does not inquire with- out any purpose (prayojanam anuddiśya mando&rsquo;pi na pravartate). We make no effort to know about a subject in which we have no interest. Therefore, inquiry into Brahman must also have some purpose for which it is undertaken. That purpose is explained as meditation, dhimahi.

105 Bhāgavata Purana as the Natural Commentary
on Brahma-sutra and Gayatri
In commenting on the Brahma-sutra in question, various ācāryas have explained that the words athato (atha atah) signify that a person whose heart has become purified by the execution of religious duties becomes inclined to brahma-jijñāsā!&rdquo; This is because he realizes that all ritualistic activities for fulfilling certain desires produce results that are temporary and limited, while the realization of Brahman grants eternal beatitude. This realization is intuited through meditation, as is said: ātmā vā are draṣṭavyaḥ śrotavyo mantavyo nididhyasitavyaḥ (BAU 2.4.5). Therefore, inquiry into Brahman implies meditation on it; otherwise, mere study of the Vedas and the acquisition of theoretical knowledge are futile, like maintaining a dry cow.pl or to se desil art mont
As understood from the first sutra, meditation on Brahman is the import of Vedanta, which is the essence of the Vedas, and since the Bhāgavatam begins with meditation on Bhagavan, it is the essence of the Vedas. This is also expressed by Sūta Gosvāmī: &ldquo;Srimad Bhagavatam is said to be the essence of all Vedanta (i.e., the Upanisads)&rdquo; (SB 12.13.15) 20
The plural in the verb dhimahi implies a multitude of meditators and thus refutes vivarta-vāda, which admits only one conscious being, or jiva. Moreover, it signifies that meditation on Bhagavan is not limited to a single person or group but is a universal process relevant for all times, places, and individuals. It also implies that Bhagavan has a form, since meditating on a formless reality is not possible.
Meditation, or bhakti, is thus superior to jñāna or yoga. It is the ideal process. According to Brahma, the supreme authority on Vedic knowledge, any method without bhakti is useless (SB 10.14.4). In GĪTĀ 12.1, Arjuna inquires as to which transcendentalist is supe- rior- the one who worships Bhagavan directly or the one who worships His unmanifest form. Śrī Kṛṣṇa replies categorically that the first is superior, whereas the second is obliged to face

105 Bhāgavata Purana as the Natural Commentary on Brahma-sutra and Gayatri
Now the words atha and ataḥ [&ldquo;Now therefore,&rdquo; with which the Brahma-sutra begins] are explained here [in the first verse of the Bhāgavatam] by the word satyam. In this word pairing, atha is used in the sense of immediate sequence or succession, and the word ataḥ indicates the cause of the relation to the preced- ing topic. So, the word atha here means &ldquo;after the attainment of complete knowledge of karma by deliberation on the Purva- mīmāmsā.&rdquo; Such knowledge of moral obligation comes first in the sequence of study in the karma-kända. The word ataḥ then means that next in the sequence [after completing the study of karma-kāṇḍa], we come to the brahma-kända [as the subject of study].
अत इति तत्क्रमतः समनन्तरं प्राप्तब्रह्मकाण्डे तूत्तरमीमांसया निर्णेयसम्यगर्थेऽधीतच- राद् यत्किञ्चिदनुसंहितार्थात् कुतश्चिद् वाक्याद्धेतोरित्यर्थः ।
In this regard, causality of relation to the preceding topic, as indicated by the word ataḥ, is shown first of all because it is by deliberation on the Uttara-mimämsä [i.e., the Brahma-sūtras] that the proper meaning of all that was studied before [in karma- kāṇḍa] can be ascertained; secondly, because there is some con- comitant result available; and thirdly, because there are some statements in the karma-kända [which impel one to study the brahma-kāṇḍa]. [These three factors are described below.] BA

The meaning of atha atah is certainly &ldquo;after the study and prac- tice of Purva-mimämsä,&rdquo; as determined from the following rea- soning. Because the Purva-mimämsä is the oppositional princi- ple, it is certainly necessary [to have knowledge of it] in the study of Uttara-mimämsä, which is the concluding and sub- sequent work. Moreover, the Pūrva-mimämsä is determined to be helpful in some of its parts that are unopposed to the Uttara-mīmāṁsā. Additionally, karma [i.e., prescribed action] is instrumental in the purification of the heart characterized by the development of qualities such as peacefulness.

Both of these paths [karma-kända and brahma-kāṇḍa] have been described in Śrī Rāmānujācārya&rsquo;s commentary on the Brahma- sūtra (1.1.1): &ldquo;It is understood from scripture that the result of karma, which is learned from the prior division of Mimämsä, is petty and temporary, while the result of the knowledge of Brahman, conclusively dealt with in the subsequent division (Uttara-mīmāṁsā), is unlimited and imperishable. Therefore, immediately after acquiring knowledge of karma from the prior instruction, Brahman is to be known. This is stated by Bhagavan Baudhayana, the earliest commentator [on the sutras], &lsquo;After acquaintance with karma from Purva-mimämsä, one desires to know Brahman.&rdquo;&rdquo;

This indeed is illuminated by the etymological meaning of the words pitṛ-hu and deva-hu, used for the right and left ears, respectively, in the narration of Purañjana [in SB 4.25.50-51; the right ear being geared to hearing topics related to the path of the forefathers, i.e., karma, and the left ear to that of the highest gods, i.e., jñāna]. In this way, after assimilating proper knowledge of karma-kända, one comes to understand the miser- able and temporary nature of &ldquo;so-called&rdquo; heavenly bliss through careful deliberation on it with reference to some statements found in the brahma-kända. For one thus equipped with this understanding and who recognizes Brahman as eternal tran- scendental bliss, knowledge that Brahman is the Supreme Truth itself becomes the cause for the inquiry into Brahman.

In this way, having understood the above as the meaning of the word pairing atha and ataḥ, [Śrī Vyasa] declares its quintessen- tial meaning as truth (satyam). The word satya means &ldquo;that real- ity whose existence is utterly essential to all other existences. This is concluded because the word satyam is here coupled with the word param, and in the Śruti, it is in turn coupled with brahman, &ldquo;Brahman is Truth, Knowledge, and Infinite&rdquo; (satyam jñānam anantam brahma, TU 2.1.1).

This pairing consists of two words combined in sandhi, atha, and ataḥ. The word atha is used to signify &ldquo;auspi- ciousness, subsequence, beginning, inquiry, and completeness&rdquo; (Amara-kośa 3.3.247) 26 Śrī Jiva Gosvāmī says that here it has been used in the sense of &ldquo;subsequence.&rdquo; After studying the Vedas from the angle of Purva-mīmāṁsā and having thus practiced one&rsquo;s sva- dharma as prescribed in the Vedas, a person may come to realize that Pūrva-mīmāṁsā does not embody the ultimate meaning of the Vedas. One then comes to the study of Brahman.

Bhagavata Purana as the Natural Commentary
on Brahma-sutra and Gayatri
ascAn objection may be raised to this particular meaning of the word atha, and it may instead be argued that it means auspicious- ness, mangala. It is a tradition to begin an undertaking with an auspicious word or statement, as is said, &ldquo;A scripture that begins with mangala becomes popular and brings glory to the propaga- tor. Those who study such scriptures live long and attain success in their endeavors.&ldquo;27 The word atha is auspicious like the word Om, and it has therefore been used by Vyasa to invoke auspiciousness at the beginning of the Brahma-sutra.
oin In his commentary, Sankarācārya replies to the above objection. He says that auspiciousness cannot be included in the meaning of a sentence. Only the meanings of the words that constitute a sen- tence can be part of its meaning. The significance of a word that is used to give meaning to the sentence can be either direct or indi- cated. In the case of the word atha, however, auspiciousness is nei- ther of these two meanings. The auspiciousness attributed to atha arises from its sound, like that of a conch. Does this mean then that the word atha can never be used for auspiciousness? Vacaspati Miśra replies that it is auspicious while being used in another sense. In other words, when the word atha is used to mean &ldquo;subsequence,&rdquo; it also produces auspiciousness merely by the pronunciation of its sound.
There is an injunction in the Veda, &ldquo;One should study the branch of the Veda [to which one belongs]&rdquo; (svädhyāyo&rsquo;dhyetavyah). Based on this injunction, the twice-born used to practice reciting and memorizing the branch of the Veda preserved in their family. Once they had completed it, they would study the Pūrva-mīmāṁsā, which teaches the meaning of these Vedic statements and how to execute the various sacrifices prescribed therein.
This is the meaning of the word atha as it appears at the begin- ning of the Jaimini-sutra, athato dharma-jijñāsā (1.1.1). After one has studied Pūrva-mimāmṣā and comes to realize that the outcome of

one&rsquo;s prescribed duty, karma, is temporary and becomes dispas- sionate toward such conventions, one then becomes qualified to study Vedanta. This is the meaning of the word atha, &ldquo;after the study of the Karma-mimämsä.&rdquo;
bow avoiɔigeus
The word ataḥ literally means &ldquo;therefore.&rdquo; It carries the sense of reasoning. The combined sense of these two words is thus as follows: &ldquo;Because one has completed the study of the karma-kända portion of the Vedas and has realized that it cannot bestow ulti- mate happiness, one awakens detachment. As a consequence, one should then study the jñāna-kanda division and inquire into Brahman.&rdquo;
There are three reasons for inquiring into Brahman (brahma- jijñāsā) after completing one&rsquo;s study of Purva-mimāṁsā. First, without the knowledge of Purva-mimämsä, one will not under- stand Uttara-mīmāmsā, because the former amounts to the opposi- tional view (pūrva-pakṣa) that is then refuted in the latter system. Secondly, the practice of sva-dharma, as recommended by Purva- mimämsä, purifies one&rsquo;s heart and thus prepares one for the path recommended by Uttara-mimämsä. Finally, Purva-mīmāṁsā leads only to a temporary result. Vedanta, or Uttara-mimämsä, offers the ultimate meaning and purpose of the Vedas, which is attainment of the Absolute Reality.
hazoe
That the study of Pūrva-mīmāṁsā should be followed by the study of Uttara-mimämsä is explained by Śri Narada to King Pracin- abarhi in the course of narrating the allegorical story of King Purañjana. In this story, Narada compares the body to a city with many gates. The right and left ears are two gates called pitṛ- hū and deva-hu, which signify the study of Purva-mīmāṁsā and Uttara-mīmāṁsă, respectively. The exact verses are given below:
Accompanied by Śrutadhara, King Purañjana went to the kingdom of Dakṣina Pancala through the gate called pitṛ-hu in the south of his city. Accompanied by Śrutadhara, King Purañjana went to the kingdom of Uttara Pañcala through the gate called deva-hu in the north of the city. (SB 4.25.50-51)28

The meaning of this allegory is explained by Śrī Nārada himself in a later chapter of the Bhagavatam. He says: soittime andmete bred bomedia oste of

The right ear is the gate called pitṛ-hu, and the left ear has been called the gate deva-hu. The scriptures dealing with the ritualis- tic ceremonies [prescribed by Purva-mīmāmsă] are called the king- dom of Dakṣiņa Pañcāla, and those teaching the path of devotion to the Absolute [prescribed by Uttara-mimamsă] are called the land of Uttara Pañcāla. Listening to these through the gateway of the ear it has been described as Śrutadhara (the companion of Purañjana). The study of the first one leads to the path of the pitṛs, or forefa- thers [heaven], and the study of the other to the path of the devas. (SB 4.29.12-13)29

From this, it is clear that the word atha has been used in the sense of &ldquo;subsequence,&rdquo; i.e., &ldquo;One should inquire into Brahman after completing one&rsquo;s study of the karma-kanda portion of the Vedas through the vision of Purva-mīmāmsā.&rdquo; Additionally, the word atah is used in the sense of reasoning. &ldquo;Because one has studied the first part and not attained the ultimate goal of life (param satyam), one should undertake an inquiry into Brahman, brahma-jijñāsā.&rdquo;
The sense is that the followers of Purva-mimämsä deliberate only on relative truth, i.e., heaven, which is temporary and thus not eternal, or satyam. The Uttara-mimämsä thus begins with the word &ldquo;now,&rdquo; implying that at the precise moment when the understand- ing dawns that there is a higher, eternal truth, the Uttara-mīmāṁsā should be studied. It is with this intention that Vyasa says satyam param dhimahi, &ldquo;Now let us meditate on the Absolute Truth.&rdquo;
The meaning of the word brahman is clarified by the word satyam. Satyam means that which exists in the past, present, and

future without any modifications, the One who is the basis of all existence. This is not the heaven of Purva-mimämsä. This mean- ing of brahman is also affirmed by the statement from Taittiriya Upanisad, &ldquo;Brahman is satyam, jñānam, and anantam - existence, consciousness, and unlimited&rdquo; (TU 2.1.1).
The entity upon whom meditation is advised must have eternal existence. Anything that exists at one time and not at another can- not be the object of meditation for everyone at all times and places. Therefore, the Bhāgavatam verse says, &ldquo;Let us meditate on param satyam, or the supreme existence.&rdquo;

Thereafter, [Vyasadeva] depicts [Bhagavan&rsquo;s] transcendence (paratva) by the word dhamna. Here the word dhāma means &ldquo;influence&rdquo; or &ldquo;radiance,&rdquo; but not &ldquo;intrinsic nature&rdquo; (svarupa), since it is said in the Amara-kośa (3.3.124), &ldquo;a house, the body, light, and influence are the synonyms of dhama.&ldquo;30 In this regard, the word kuhaka means &ldquo;the deceiver,&rdquo; and this refers specifically to the maya potency that covers and deludes the nature of the jiva. [So, the meaning of the phrase dhämna svena sada nirasta-kuhakam &hellip; is:] &ldquo;[Let us meditate on] Him by whose own influence (svena dhamna), or in other words, by whose own intrinsic potency of illumination (sva-prakāśa-rupayā), His māyā potency (kuhaka) is forever, i.e., eternally, dispelled.&rdquo; This has been stated elsewhere, &ldquo;By dint of Your conscious potency (cit-śakti), You have cast away the effects of maya&rdquo; (SB 1.7.23).31

If this potency were to be considered incidental, then its qual- ifying reflexive adjective, svena [&ldquo;His own,&rdquo; i.e., that potency which is innate to Him], would serve no purpose. And if the word svena were taken to mean &ldquo;by His own svarupa,&rdquo; then the word svena alone would have sufficed [i.e., the word dhamnā would then be redundant]. But even if somehow or other, it is so explained, still it is to be concluded that the potency that is intrinsic to Him is characterized by its capacity to repel the deluding energy. Additionally, by using the instrumental case, it is shown that this potency of His (svena dhamna) is the most efficacious means [for doing so].

From this it is understood that the real existent (vastu), which is distinct from māyā and her products, is His essential nature (svarupa), or in other words, the intrinsic characteristic (svaru- pa-lakṣaṇa) that is definitive of His essential being [expressed here through the words dhamnă svena sada nirasta-kuhakam]. This is well known in Śruti statements such as, &ldquo;The Absolute Reality is existence, consciousness, and limitless&rdquo; (TU 2.1.1), and, &ldquo;The Absolute is the personification of consciousness and bliss&rdquo; (BAU 3.9.28).

Now he [Vyasa] shows the logic behind the depiction of this [Bha- gavān] as the prime reality (mukhyam satyam) with the words, &ldquo;in whom the threefold creation is a real emergence&rdquo; (yatra tri- sargo&rsquo;mṛṣā). This creation consisting of the three gunas in the form of the material elements, the senses, and their deities, has its foundation in Bhagavan Vasudeva, who is all-pervading due to being Brahman. Being an emanation from this very Supreme Regulator, the creation too is not false, like &ldquo;apparent silver&rdquo; superimposed onto an oyster shell. Rather, it is indeed real (satyam) due to being eternally situated in that Brahman who is celebrated in Śruti statements such as, &ldquo;from whom all these beings spring forth&rdquo; (yato va imani bhūtāni jāyante, TU 3.1.1), and because He alone is its creator, as said in the Brahma-sutra: &ldquo;Names and forms are the creation of the Supreme Brahman, who compounds the elements together (trivṛt-kurvat), because it is so instructed in the scriptures&rdquo; (vs 2.4.20).32

He also verifies the creation&rsquo;s non-illusory nature by way of an example: &ldquo;even as fire, water, and earth intermix with each other to produce material objects&rdquo; (tejo-väri-mṛdām yathā vini- mayaḥ). The intermixture (vinimaya) of fire, water, and earth means that there is a partial and mutual exchange of these ele- ments, which continue to remain in each other in part. And just as this [microcosmic] interpenetration of individuated ele- ments is not false, but the way matter

Immanent Regulator (Iśvara), so too it is [on the macrocosmic scale] with the cosmos as a whole. As is said in the Śruti: &ldquo;Know how these three gods become threefold (trivṛt), each in their own turn&rdquo; (CHU 6.3.4),33 and, &ldquo;The red color in fire is that of fire, the white color is that of water, and the black is that of earth, or of food&rdquo; (CHU 6.4.1).34

In this way, since this meaning is supported by the Śruti, any other imagined meaning naturally stands refuted. In the Bhāga- vatam verse, the words fire, water, and earth (teja ādīnām) have been used in their normal sense, so to attribute to them some exceptional meaning is not appealing to the heart of those who are skilled in the denotation of words. If that was Vyasa&rsquo;s con- sideration, then he would have said, &ldquo;[the world is false] like the water in a mirage, etc.&rdquo;

Moreover, in their [the Brahma-vādī&rsquo;s] own opinion, the three- fold creation does not arise (janma) primarily from Brahman, rather, the superimposition on Brahman [of a false phenome- nal world appearance] is verily what they call creation, and that is moreover merely the result of illusion. Illusion too occurs because of similarity, but similarity at different times has a basis in both objects, since it is sometimes possible to mistake silver for an oyster shell [and not only to mistake an oyster shell

for silver]. There is no such double-standard rule that only a sin- gle item can be the substratum of an illusion while the illusion itself can be variously imagined.

In this way, from the perspective of conventional experience as well, the threefold creation is directly perceived, and there is no beginning for this. Brahman is also self-manifest as pure consciousness. Therefore, just as the jiva, who is under the influence of beginningless ignorance, mistakes Brahman for the world because of their common characteristic of existence, why would the jiva not also sometimes mistake the threefold creation for Brahman? For this reason, if it is not concluded that Brahman alone is the fountainhead, then it would lead to utter destruction. Moreover, just as there can be no superim- position of inert matter [on Brahman], so, [superimposition] of pure consciousness [on inert matter] is also impossible, and according to the Brahma-vādis, Brahman is mere consciousness and nothing else.

Therefore, having established this explanation, which is firmly rooted in the śrutis, the intention [can be summarized] as fol- lows: The superimposition (āropa) of an object takes place only when it has no factual existence in a particular substratum but is observed to exist somewhere else [for example, silver does not exist in an oyster shell, but it is found elsewhere ]. Therefore,

the existence of an object cannot be the cause of the existence of another object with which it has no real contact. But because the Śrutis affirm in their primary sense that the threefold creation has arisen from Bhagavan - He being self-endowed with such potency- and because without Him it cannot exist at all, there- fore, it verily exists in Him alone who consists of everything.
ततस्तस्मिन् न चारोपितश्च । आरोपस्तु तथापि धाम्नेत्यादिरीत्यैवाचिन्त्यशक्तित्वात् तेन लिप्तत्वाभावेऽपि तच्छङ्कारूप एव । तथा च “एकदेशस्थितस्याग्नेर्ज्योत्स्रा विस्तारिणी यथा” (वि० पु० १।२२।५५) इत्यनुसारेण तत्सत्तया तत्सत्ता भवति ।
Therefore, the creation is not superimposed on Him. But super- imposition [as a concept] persists nonetheless merely in the form of a doubt, and this too in spite of the fact that Bhagavan is altogether untainted by the created world due to His tran- srational potency, as stated in the verse, &ldquo;by whose own efful- gence all deception is utterly dispelled&rdquo; (dhämnă svena sadā nirasta-kuhakam). Moreover, according to the example [from VP 1.22.55], &ldquo;just as the light of a fire situated in one place is dif- fused all around, so also the energy of the Supreme Brahman pervades this whole universe,&rdquo; it is by virtue of His existence alone that the world also exists.

Thus, Bhagavan&rsquo;s reality (satyatva) is primary, and the three- fold creation is also not false. This is supported by the following Śruti: &ldquo;He is the truth of existence. The vital life force (prāna) is indeed real, and He is the core truth of that reality&rdquo; (BAU 2.1.20). This Śruti text shows that the Supreme Reality is Bhagavan, who is the original source of all gross and subtle beings - herein referred to by the word prana (&ldquo;the vital life force&rdquo;) - which have been admitted to be real by practical experience.
703
IV Determination of Bhagavan as the Subject of Bhagavata Purāṇa
Commentary
Having explained the meaning of athataḥ as inquiry into Brahman that is preceded by the study of Purva-mīmāmsā, Śrī Jiva shows that this Brahman, which is called satyam in the verse, is not devoid of potency. Rather, It is replete with potency in Its svarupa by which It remains free from the influence of maya. This potency is not inci- dental, as certified by its reflexive adjective svena, meaning &ldquo;by that which is innate to It.&rdquo;
Advaitavada does not accept that Brahman, the Absolute Real- ity, is endowed with Its own potency, because they believe on the basis of conventional logic alone that such an admission is tanta- mount to the acceptance of duality (i.e., there is Brahman on one hand and Its potency on the other). So, they may raise an objection and argue that the word svena means &ldquo;by Its own svarupa,&rdquo; and that therefore there is no need to explain that the Absolute has potency within It. It keeps māyā away by Its own essential being alone.
To this, Śrī Jiva responds that if such an explanation is accepted, then the word dhamnă becomes redundant. Even if this is over- looked, it would still mean that the Absolute has energy in Its svarupa by which It keeps māyā away. This would be implied by use of the instrumental case in the word svena. The third case is used for the most immediate instrument used by an agent for complet- ing an action (Harināmāmṛta-vyakarana 4.100).35 The instrument obviously has the potential to complete the action and to culminate in the result of the action. Thus, in either case, the Absolute, which is referred to by the word satyam, has the potency to dispel māyā. This is the intrinsic definition (svarupa-lakṣaṇa) of the Absolute (Brahman).
Next, Śrī Jīva identifies this satyam as Brahman on the basis of statements from the Taittiriya and Bṛhad-aranyaka Upanisads. The word satyam is also indicative of jñāna, ananda, and ananta, which are used in these Upanisads along with satyam. Because the Absolute is satyam, or real, His threefold creation is also real, trisargo&rsquo;mṛṣã. The threefold creation includes the sense objects, the

senses, and their presiding deities. These three are also referred to as the creation&rsquo;s adhibhautika, adhyatmika, and ädhidaivika aspects. Just as the intermixture of earth, water, and fire is not illusory, so too, the creation as a whole, which is derived from this mixture, is not illusory.or
Toy From the Śruti statement, &ldquo;from whom all these beings spring forth&rdquo; (TU 3.1.1),36 it is understood that the Absolute is the source of creation. The Śruti also affirms that He evolved the elements, entered them, and created names and forms. He [who had created fire, water, and earth] thought, &ldquo;Let it be that now, by entering these devatās [the elements] along with the individual self, the jiva, I shall clearly manifest name and form.&rdquo; Then He said, &ldquo;Let Me mix these three tripartite,&rdquo; [i.e., each includes its own essence as the principal part and the other two as secondary parts]. Then, enter- ing into these three devatas with the jivātma alone, He manifested names and forms (CHU 6.3.2-3)37abbrows sift on bas noluit s

From this description, it is clear that the Supreme Person evolved the elements as well as the objects of the world. There is no mention here that the elements that constitute the creation, or the creation itself, are imaginary. The Bhagavatam, being an explanation of Vedānta, has no purpose in establishing any princi- ple contrary to it. If the intention of Vyasa was to inform us that the world is illusory, then instead of tejo-vari-mṛdām yathā vini- mayaḥ, he would have said, &ldquo;As one mistakes a mirage for water&rdquo; (vāry-ādīni yathā maricikādiṣu), or something along those lines. d
In the opinion of Advaitavada, Brahman has no potency or qual- ity. The world is not real, thus it is not created but only an illu- sory appearance, vivarta, of Brahman, like a snake misperceived in a rope. This illusion is called aropa or adhyāsa. Śankarācārya defines adhyāsa as false knowledge, like the memory of a known object applied to another object (Sankara-bhäṣya 1.1.1) 38 The known object may or may not be real.

IV Determination of Bhagavan as the Subject of Bhagavata Purāṇa
Śrī Jiva Gosvāmi says that aropa occurs due to an illusion caused by similarity, such as between a rope and a snake, or between an oyster shell and silver. But there is no similarity between Brah- man and the world; both have opposing qualities. If it is argued that there is similarity of existence between them, one must then ask why the world cannot be mistaken for Brahman. This never happens. It is certainly a possibility that a person may sometimes mistake a snake for a rope, as is described in the stories of Bilva- mangala and Tulasi Dāsa. But has it ever happened that someone mistook the world for Brahman?
To this, it may be replied that the basis or substratum of an illu- sion is only one, whereas the objects superimposed onto it may be many. For example, a snake can be mistaken not only for a rope, but also for a garland, a crack in the ground, a dried portion of a creeper, a belt, and so on. So, only Brahman can be the basis of an illusion and not the world, since the former is one, whereas the world has various objects in it.
Śrī Jiva denies, however, that this is the case. It is quite possible that one could mistake a mountain, the trees on it, and smoke - all taken together - for a cloud, when seeing them from afar. Here the thing superimposed is one, but the bases are three. If it were accepted that the world can also be the basis of illusion, this would contradict the Śruti and other scriptures, because the Śruti very clearly states that the world comes from Brahman, yato vā imāni bhūtāni jayante. Nowhere is it said that Brahman comes from the world.
Moreover, neither the world nor Brahman can be the agent of superimposition or illusion, because the world is inert and Brah- man is without ego. An inert thing cannot be an agent. Only a con- scious being can be an agent. Brahman is conscious, but in the opin- ion of the Advaitavādīs, it is also qualityless, formless, and without ego. Hence, it has no capacity to superimpose.
Sankarācārya has also defined adhyasa as considering an object to be what it is not.39 This means that superimposition of one object

on another takes place where the former does not exist. In other words, there is no contact between the base of the illusion and its object. Such a thing would not be possible in the case of Brahman because It is all-pervading, so nothing can be superimposed onto It.

Moreover, for a cause-effect relation to exist between two objects, they must have factual existence. But if Brahman is the only reality and the world is mere illusion, then it is not possible to establish a cause-effect relation between them. This contradicts the opening words of the Bhāgavatam verse under discussion (1.1.1) as well as numerous Vedic statements proclaiming Brahman as the cause of the world. This proves that the world is not an outcome of adhyāsa rooted in the ignorance of the jiva, but is a creation of Bhagavan who has real potency, as attested by the Śruti. This is the significance of the words yatra trisargo&rsquo;mṛṣā in the verse.

Even if for the sake of argument it is conjectured that the mean- ing [of Brahma-sutra (1.1.2)] is, &ldquo;Brahman is that from which arises the illusion of the creation, etc., of the cosmos,&rdquo; that still does not prove Brahman to be attributeless, since that would mean accepting that ignorance is the root of illusion and that the witness of this ignorance is Brahman.od agil bom bells&rsquo;s

Witnessing is said to be the result of pure [i.e., unitary] luminos- ity.

other than Its potency (śakti). This potency too is threefold - intrinsic, extrinsic, and intermediary - as has been shown. Out of these, the extrinsic potency (bahiranga-sakti) alone is the direct cause behind the modifications in the form of cre- ation, etc., of the cosmos, and by this description the potency called māyā has been introduced in the very beginning [of verse 1.1.1 with the words janmady asya].

It is not that because He has a form that He must therefore have been born from someone else. Such a postulate would lead to the defect of infinite regress, since it has been accepted that only one entity can be the original cause, just as the unmanifest primor- dial nature (avyakta) is so-accepted in the Sankhya philosophy. Moreover, the Śrutis deny that there is any other cause above Him, as in verses like, &ldquo;He is the supreme cause and the Overlord of the predominating deities of the senses; He has no other cre- ator or Lord above Him&rdquo; (su 6.9).&rdquo; Furthermore, it is commonly accepted that He has a beginningless transphenomenal intrinsic form.

A lakṣaṇa, or defining characteristic, is that which distinguishes one object from everything else.55 An object has two types of such defining characteristics, i.e., the intrinsic (svarupa-lakṣaṇa) and

the extrinsic or incidental (taṭastha-lakṣaṇa). The first refers to those features that are essential to the very existence of the object, such as its form, qualities, and innate potency, and which distin- guish it from all other objects belonging to a different class. The second refers to the qualities, energy, or actions that manifest out- side the svarupa of the object, and which distinguish it from other objects of the same or a different class.
As stated earlier, Jiva Gosvāmi takes satyam param in the intro- ductory verse of the Bhagavatam to be the svarupa-lakṣaṇa of the Absolute, Brahman. The taṭastha-lakṣana is given in the beginning part of the verse, &ldquo;from Him arise the creation, etc., of the cos- mos&rdquo; (janmādy asya yataḥ). The cosmos is not part of the Abso- lute&rsquo;s form but a manifestation of His energy. Although the cos- mos also characterizes Him, we cannot know His intrinsic nature (svarupa) merely by seeing this world, just as an artist&rsquo;s creation tells us something about him, but gives us no idea of his physical
appearance.
The above words are an exact quote of the second Brahma-sutra, further confirming that the Bhagavata Purāņa is intended as an explanation of the Brahma-sutra. Indeed, it is for this very purpose that Śrī Vyasa uses these words to open this book. The pronoun yataḥ indicates the cause of the cosmos, &ldquo;from whom.&rdquo; The genitive case in the word asya (from the pronoun idam) shows the relation between the cosmos and its creation. The pronoun idam refers to objects in one&rsquo;s near vicinity. Thus, the meaning is &ldquo;of this,&rdquo; i.e., the visible universe. The word adi (&ldquo;beginning with&rdquo;) in the com- pound janmädi (janma-ādi) indicates that the world&rsquo;s sustenance and dissolution are to be included along with its creation.
The compound (samāsa) janmadi is of the possessive type, called bahuvrihi, in which the object or entity denoted by the compound

School. The other schools of Vedanta, both theistic and non-theistic, do not
subscribe to it. My honorable Gurudeva compiled a book named Vedanta-darśana in which each sutra of the Brahma-sutra is related to its corresponding verse from Bhagavata Purāna.

is distinct from the constituent members of the compound.&rdquo; Bahu- vrihi compounds are of two types, namely, atad-guna-samvijñāna and tad-guna-samvijñāna. In the first type, the qualities belonging to the constituent members of the compound do not constitute the external object denoted by the compound or are not perceived in the description. For example, in the sentence, dṛṣṭa-kṛṣṇam anaya, &ldquo;Bring the person who has seen Kṛṣṇa,&rdquo; the bahuvrihi compound is dṛsta-kṛṣṇa, &ldquo;the person who has seen Kṛṣṇa.&rdquo; But Kṛṣṇa is not part of the person who has seen Him. Therefore, dṛṣṭa-kṛṣṇa is an atad-guna-samvijñāna bahuvrihi compound.
In the second type, the qualities of the constituent members of the compound are in connection with the external object denoted by the compound. For example, dhṛta-kṛṣṇa-nirmalyam anaya, &ldquo;Bring the person who is wearing Kṛṣṇa&rsquo;s garland.&rdquo; Here the per- son who is to be brought can be seen to be wearing the kṛṣṇa-prasādī garland. Bauan
According to Śri Jiva, the compound janmadi is of the latter type. It, thus, signifies that particular series which has the word janma as its first member, janma ādi yasya sah, implying janma, sthiti, and laya. In Anucchedas 61-67, it was shown that the cosmos is not dif- ferent from its source, Paramātmā, because the effect is nondiffer- ent from, and pervaded by, its cause. This would mean that the phenomenon denoted by the compound, i.e., cosmic creation, sus- tenance, and dissolution, is pervaded by Brahman or Paramātmā. Consequently, the creation, sustenance, and dissolution of the cos- mos are defining characteristics of Brahman. But because they are not directly part of His svarupa, or essential being, they are thus considered to be extrinsic characteristics, or the taṭastha-lakṣaṇa

rice&rdquo;] itself, the last member loses its character of a substantive and together with the first member serves to qualify a noun&rdquo; (Monier Williams: 726). Cf. PANINI 2.2.23. In other words, instead of &ldquo;much rice,&rdquo; the compound rather refers to &ldquo;[someone] possessing much rice.&rdquo; In Hari-nāmāmṛta-vyākaraṇa 6.102, Śri Jiva uses the compound pitambara, &ldquo;yellow cloth,&rdquo; as an example of this type of compound. The compound refers instead to, &ldquo;He who wears a yellow cloth,&rdquo; and as such it is a popular name of Kṛṣṇa.

of Brahman. This means that Brahman is not without qualities and potencies. This refutes the basic tenet of Advaitavada, which posits an unqualified, formless, and impotent Brahman as the supreme cause of the cosmos. But how can such a Brahman be the agent as well as the material cause of the cosmos?betons outdo laniste
The Brahma-sutras are based upon some specific statements of the Upanisads (also called Vedanta). These statements form the subject, visaya-vakya, discussed in each sutra. The janmady asya yataḥ sutra (vs 1.1.2) is based upon the statements of Taitti- riya Upanisad cited in this anuccheda. The creation, sustenance, and dissolution of the cosmos are upalakṣaṇa, or in other words, incidental distinguishing marks of Brahman, and not viseṣaṇa, or essential defining characteristics. The difference between the two is that the latter is included within the svarupa of Brahman, while the former is external to Its nature.59 is tiguanded of a
If a visitor asks about the location of the Jiva Institute and it is pointed out to him that it is the building on top of which a monkey is sitting, then the visitor sees the monkey and locates the building. Here, the monkey is an upalakṣana for the Jiva Institute. It is not integral to the building; yet, it helps in distinguishing it from the other surrounding constructions.
If, however, the visitor is told that the Jiva Institute building is green in color, the green color is understood as an essential defin- ing characteristic. It not only distinguishes the building from the neighboring ones but is also integral to it. It will not disappear like the monkey. Śrī Jiva concludes, therefore, that the creation, being an upalakṣaṇa, does not form part of the meditation on the Supreme Truth (satyam param), because it is not a permanent fea- ture of Brahman. Otherwise, the unchanging quality - signified by the word satyam - of the object of meditation (param) would be violated.
The next important point made here by the author is that this satyam param, the supreme object of meditation, who is the source of creation, is omnipotent, omniscient, endowed with infallible resolve, and is the supreme controller. To create something, one

must have knowledge of how to create, awareness of the ingredi- ents required, the intention and ability to do so, and the power to ward off any obstacles. Otherwise, one would not be able to create. This is the natural conclusion.
Śankarācārya proposes that Brahman is devoid of all potencies. But in that case, the second sutra would make no sense. How can a qualityless, formless, and impotent Brahman be the cause of cre- ation? This is certainly not supported by Śruti statements such as, &ldquo;The Supreme Person has variegated potencies that are intrinsic to His being, including knowledge, will, and action&rdquo; (su 6.8); &ldquo;In the beginning, there was only the ātmā in the form of a person&rdquo; (ätmaivedam agra āsīt puruṣa-vidhaḥ, BAU 1.4.1). To reply to this objection, Śankarācārya postulates two Brahmans, namely, kāraṇa (causal) or nirguna Brahman, and karya (derivative) or saguna Brah- man. These statements, however, are not about the saguna or karya Brahman, because Brahman is described as nirguna, or free of all material gunas:
In
mbeV) Tele-vel el bbm vd betintil
elivand
There is One Lord who is hidden within all beings. He is all- pervading and the interior Self of all beings. He is the overseer of all actions, the original abode of all beings, the witness, conscious, pure, and untouched by the material gunas. (śu 6.11) 60
Here the word nirguna is applied to Brahman, who performs the functions of the so-called karya Brahman, which entail being the Self within all entities, the witness, and so on.
If the object of inquiry, Brahman, mentioned in the first sutra, is accepted as qualityless, then the second sutra, which gives the taṭastha-lakṣaṇa of Brahman, becomes incoherent, because it assumes Brahman to be potent and omniscient. The very etymo- logical meaning of the word brahman is contrary to the concept of Advaitavada.
If, however, one posits that qualityless Brahman can be proven by inference, then Śrī Jīva shows that this is not possible. Infer- ence is based upon vyapti, or the invariable concomitance between

719IV Determination of Bhagavan as the Subject of Bhagavata Purāṇa
the sadhya (probandum), or the thing to be proven, and the hetu (probans), or the cause that is perceived by us and used as the means to prove the sadhya. Because the sadhya is qualityless Brahman, it cannot have any relation with anything else. Hence, inference is not possible due to the absence of vyapti. 20gog sv
Advaitavada may explain the second sutra as follows: &ldquo;That from which arises the illusion of the creation, sustenance, and dissolution of the cosmos is Brahman.&rdquo; This would mean that the world is unreal. They claim, therefore, that there is no need to infer that Brahman has potency by which it creates. Śrī Jiva replies to this interpretation as given below.
According to Advaitavada, the cause of illusion is ignorance (avidya), and Brahman is the witness (sākṣi) of this ignorance. The antah-karana (the internal psychic organ) is inert, and thus it can- not illuminate the vṛtti and provide knowledge of objects. Brahman limited by the antaḥ-karana is the jiva-sākṣi, and the same Brahman limited by māyā is isvara-sākṣi (Vedanta-paribhāṣā 1). Illumination by the sākṣi means that it has the power to illuminate itself and oth- ers, like the sun. This establishes that it is inherently endowed with potency and thus cannot be qualityless. They
Śrī Jiva Gosvāmi argues that if Brahman were impotent, then the words janmady asya yataḥ in this verse would be unnecessary. It would have been sufficient to say tejo-väri-mṛdām yatha vini- mayo yatra, &ldquo;[Let us meditate on] Brahman, upon whom the world is superimposed, like the appearance of water in a mirage or ice mistaken for a crystal.&ldquo;61
Thus, the conclusion is that Brahman, which has been referred to here as satyam param, is a potent being, and its potency is three- fold, which has been described in Bhagavat Sandarbha (Anucche- das 16-17). &ldquo;Let us meditate&rdquo; refers to the intermediary potency called the jivas, who are conditioned by maya and need to meditate on Bhagavan in order to become free from the shackles of māyā.
61 Śrī Jīva Gosvāmī here assumes the meaning of this part of the verse as might be
given by the Advaitavadīs. He offers a different meaning, as is seen in the text above.

The extrinsic potency is referred to by &ldquo;from Him come the cre- ation, etc.,&rdquo; and also by the word kuhaka. The intrinsic potency is indicated by the words dhamnă svena, &ldquo;by His own prowess.&rdquo;
All this also signifies that this satyam param is inherently endowed with form, being the source of all forms. This Absolute endowed with form is none other than Bhagavan. Bhagavan is the ultimate or unconditional cause and, hence, without any other cause. Thus, because it is observed that every form has a cause, one should not conjecture that because Bhagavan too has a form, He must also have another source. Rather, He is identified as the cause of all causes, sarva-kāraṇa-kāraṇa (Brahma-samhita 5.1).

Scripture too specifically pro- pounds the Supreme Form (svarupa), who is categorically dis- tinct from all objects perceived by all other means of knowledge, who is an immeasurable incomparable ocean of wonderful gen- erous qualities accompanied by omniscience and true resolve, and whose essential nature is diametrically opposed to all infe- rior objects. He does not have even an iota of the defects found in objects perceived by other means. From this, it is also estab- lished that He is self-endowed with unlimited intrinsic eternal

Commentary
The first four sutras of Brahma-sutra, popularly called catuḥ-sūtrī, are considered to be the most important and as providing the gist of the complete text. Some scholars, like Padmapādācārya, wrote explanations on these sutras alone. In his Sarva-darśana- sangraha, Madhvācārya summarizes Advaitavada on the basis of these four sutras, and indeed most Vedanta commentators con- centrate their energies here, writing copiously and deriving the distinctive philosophical tenets of their school from them.
zo Śrī Jiva Gosvāmī now shows that the meaning of all four sutras can be found in the very first verse of Bhagavata Purāna. He has already demonstrated this for the first two sutras, so now he goes on to explain the next two, showing how they are contained therein.
723
IV Determination of Bhagavan as the Subject of Bhagavata Purāṇa
There are three means of acquiring valid knowledge (pramāna) that are accepted by the various theistic schools of Vedanta, as well as by those of Sankhya and Yoga: perception (pratyakṣa), infer- ence (anumāna), and the statements of a reliable person (sabda, apta-vākya). The first means is inadequate to disclose knowledge of the Absolute, because the Absolute is altogether beyond sense perception. Inference is based upon the knowledge of vyapti (the invariable concomitance between the inferential cause and its inferred predicate), acquired through sense perception. There- fore, it too is ineffective in providing reliable knowledge of the Absolute. Naiyayikas establish the existence of Iśvara, the creator of the cosmos, by logic or inference. But logic is never certain. One can always postulate superior arguments to refute another, as stated by Bhartṛhari:
A position that is asserted even with meticulous attention by re expert logicians can be shown to be otherwise by those who are he even more clever. (Vākya-pādīya 1.34, quoted in BRS 1.1.46) do zori do ai
Śrī Jiva has provided three sample inferences to show the futil- ity of trying to prove God&rsquo;s existence on the basis of logic alone. The first posits that God cannot be the creator, because He is devoid of ambition, like a liberated person, and hence He has no purpose to achieve by such an act. Why should an intelligent, omniscient God engage in a futile endeavor? An action implies that its agent has some purpose to fulfill for which the action is performed. jarit snif
The second inference argues that the world is like any other product, such as a clay pot, which is made by a potter. So, the world too must be created by the jiva, who has some purpose to fulfill through its production, and not by God. The presumption here is that although the jivas are limited, a particular jiva through accumulation of unprecedented merit could conceivably acquire the extraordinary power necessary to create a universe to fulfill its desires. Hence, there is no need to infer the existence of some other entity (i.e., God), who is distinct from the jivas and unseen.

The third inference argues that universal time is never bereft of the world, even in the state of dissolution, as conjectured by some philosophers. Effectively speaking, this is to say that the world was never created because it is never really annihilated, and thus there is no necessity of a creator. In this way, by logic alone one cannot come to any conclusive decision about the creation or its creator.
Therefore, the third Brahma-sutra concludes that only scripture can disclose reliable knowledge about Brahman, which is beyond the purview of our sense perception. Independent of scripture, no one can say conclusively anything positive or negative about Brahman.zer

The pronoun tat (that) refers to the fact [expressed in the previous sūtra] that scripture is the only possible valid means to know Brahman. How is that? Because of consistent reconciliation, samanvayāt.

From the meanings (artheșu) of the state- ments of the Vedas, though they be of differing types - whether from the perspective of affirmation (anvayat) or from the per- spective of disaffirmation (itaratah) - the creation, sustenance, and dissolution of the cosmos is understood to have issued forth from Him alone. Therefore, it is also implied that He is the sup- reme goal of human life, being established directly and indi- rectly by the Śruti as having the nature of supreme joy. He [Bhagavan] was previously established as such on the authority of scriptural statements, such as, &ldquo;In the beginning, there was indeed only Nārāyaṇa&rdquo; (Mahā-nārāyaṇa Upanisad 1.1).83

The fourth Brahma-sutra establishes that the samanvaya, i.e., the integrality or unity of all the Vedic scriptures, is to be found only in Bhagavan, the source of the creation, sustenance, and dissolu- tion of the cosmos. Samanvaya means to understand the purport of a text by anvaya and vyatireka statements. Anvaya means affir- mative statements of inclusion or invariable concomitance (vyāpti), such as, &ldquo;All this is Brahman.&rdquo; Vyatireka means disaffirmative state- ments of exclusion, such as, &ldquo;Nothing can exist without Brahman.&rdquo;

729IV Determination of Bhagavan as the Subject of Bhagavata Purāṇa
While commenting on this sutra, Baladeva Vidyabhūṣaṇa defines samanvaya as the purport of scripture arrived at by proper deliberation through analysis of the six determining indicators (sad-linga) 84 These were stated at the beginning of this anuccheda. In any case, samanvaya is the prime essence of all scriptures, regardless of how one arrives at it. The word literally means &ldquo;that which is present appropriately in all sentences of scripture.&rdquo; Anvaya-vyatireka and sad-linga are different means to ascertain this scriptural concordance (samanvaya).Sins
From the samanvaya of Vedic statements, one comes to know the subject matter of the Vedas, which is Brahman. This is clear from the references cited here. This Brahman, which is under- stood from the harmonic reconciliation of Vedic scripture, has the nature of bliss, ananda. It is only by attaining Brahman that one becomes blissful (cf. TU 2.7.1). Consequently, this indeed is the sup- reme goal of human endeavor (parama-puruṣārtha), because ulti- mately everyone strives only for bliss. There is nothing higher than bliss to be achieved by all our efforts. Bliss is the end and not merely a means to something else. Śrī Jiva also refers to Brahma-sutra 1.1.12 in support of this conclusion. give
faildetes vlaunivery sw, advegada The meaning of these two sutras, i.e., the third and fourth (vs 1.1.3-4), is expressed in the Bhagavata Purana verse under discussion with the phrase anvayad itaratas cartheșu. In accor- dance with Jiva Gosvāmi&rsquo;s explanation above, this phrase would mean the following: &ldquo;[The Absolute Truth, upon whom we medi- tate, is concluded to be the foundational source of the creation of the cosmos] from the import (artheșu) of all the various types of Vedic statements, be they affirmative (anvayat) or disaffirmative (itarataḥ).&rdquo;

to the conclusion that both directly and indirectly the Vedas culmi- nate only in Bhagavan. Śrī Kṛṣṇa Himself confirms this: &ldquo;From all the Vedas, I [Bhagavan] am to be known&rdquo; (GĪTĀ 15.15).
This is also stated in the Bṛhad-aranyaka Upanisad: &ldquo;I inquire about that Supreme Person who is to be known only from the Upanisads&rdquo; (BAU 3.9.26) 85 The ritualistic result-oriented actions prescribed in the Vedas are meant only to impel those who are dis- interested in ultimate truth. If a person becomes convinced that the Vedic rituals have the power to fulfill his mundane desires, he develops faith in them and becomes inclined to study them. But after proper deliberation, he is able to discriminate between such ephemeral benefits and the ultimate goal of love of God.

Here the unmanifest primordial nature (pradhana), described by others [i.e., the proponents of Sankhya philosophy], may also be posited as the cause of the cosmos. But this sūtra (ikṣater nāśabdam) informs us that this is not the case.

That for which the scriptural revelation (sabda) is not a source of valid testimony (pramāna) is called aśabda, i.e., pradhāna, which is discernible through inference instead. That [pradhana] is not what is being established here [in the scriptural determi- nation of the source of creation].

Why is it that pradhana is not validated by scriptural revela- tion? Anticipating this doubt, the sutra says ikṣateḥ, because of the mention of [Brahman&rsquo;s] act of seeing. In other words, [pradhana is not supported as such] because scripture expressly employs the root Viks (&ldquo;to see&rdquo;), which denotes the specific activ- ity related to the meaning of the word sat, or &ldquo;conscious exis- tence&rdquo; [mentioned in CHU 6.2.1, which is the visaya-vakya for this sūtra]. There it is also said, &ldquo;He glanced,&rdquo; but such glancing is not possible for the inert pradhana.

In other places [in the Śruti] also, it has been said that the cre- ation is preceded by the act of seeing: &ldquo;He glanced [with the intention], &lsquo;Let me create the worlds&rdquo; (Aitareya Upanisad 1.1.1); &ldquo;He created these worlds [i.e., the vast space beyond heaven, the

visible galaxy, the earth, and the subterranean world]&rdquo; (Aita- reya Upanisad 1.1.1-2).87 The act of seeing here entails omni- science, because it involves deliberating on all that is to be cre- ated within the cosmos. Therefore [to convey this entire mean- ing of the sutra], the Bhāgavatam verse says, &ldquo;[The Supreme Truth] is omniscient&rdquo; (abhijña).

A doubt may be raised in this regard: But surely at that time, there was no possibility of there being any object for [Brahman] to glance upon, since it is stated that He was &ldquo;one alone with- out a second&rdquo; (CHU 6.2.1). To this the verse responds, &ldquo;[He is] self-resplendent (sva-rät),&rdquo; meaning that He exists in those var- ious forms by virtue of His own essential being (svarupa). This is affirmed in the mantra, &ldquo;He does not possess a material body or senses&hellip; He is inherently self-endowed with cognitive capacity (jñāna-śakti), infallible will (bala-śakti), and the capacity to act (kriya-sakti)&rdquo; (su 6.8) 88

According to classical Sankhya philosophy, the world is cre- ated by prakṛti, also called pradhana. This philosophical view does not admit Bhagavan or Iśvara as the creator. The fifth Brahma- sūtra refutes this philosophy by designating pradhana as aśabda, or that which is not validated by scriptural revelation. Pradhana is so-called because the Sankhya followers avow the existence of pradhana by inference alone and not by sabda-pramāņa. Sānkhya- kārikā 15 states: &ldquo;There exists an unmanifest cause [i.e., prakṛti] of the manifest cosmos (vaiśvarupasya), of the differentiated par- ticulars (bhedānām), because the particulars are finite and of uni- form composition, because evolution is enabled through potency, because the effect is differentiated from its cause, and because the multiform effect is ultimately reabsorbed into its cause.&ldquo;89 892-198 alpIn contradistinction to the above inference, there are explicit statements in the Śruti confirming that the cosmos is evolved through Iśvara&rsquo;s conscious act of seeing. The statement from Chandogya Upanisad says that in the beginning there was only the unique existent (sat), who glanced. This sat cannot be pradhana, because pradhana is inert, whereas glancing is an action performed by a conscious being. His glance is inclusive of the intention to create, which culminates in the evolutionary unfolding of the
cosmos.
do Seeing implies deliberation on the act of creation, which sig- nifies knowledge about creation. This indicates that Iśvara is omniscient, for without complete knowledge about the creative act and the world to be manifested, He could not bring forth the cosmos. Therefore, the Bhagavata Purana verse uses the word abhijña (omniscient) to convey the meaning of this sūtra (vs 1.1.5).
A doubt raised in this regard is that if prior to the creative act there was nothing else at all present other than the one conscious existent (sat), then how could It glance, since there was nothing to

glance upon? The reply is that when it is said that at that time sat alone existed without any second, it simply means that nothing of this world had yet been brought forth into manifestation. Just as when the head of state is on leave and is said to be alone in his man- sion, it does not mean that there are no family members or personal attendants accompanying him. All it means is that no outsiders are present in his company. There is a

Therefore, the verse also uses the word svarāț, or &ldquo;self-resplen- dent&rdquo; - He existed then with His own associates and potencies, including pradhana in its unmanifest state. He is not dependent on anything to create. He is the agent as well as the material cause of the cosmos. This is the significance of the word svarāț. Śrī Jīva also concludes that the causal source (i.e., Iśvara) must be self- endowed with form, because the act of seeing, the will to create, and omniscience would not be possible in consciousness alone, utterly devoid of form.

entity? In response, the sutra says that it is because He is the womb (yoni), i.e., the source, of the scriptures (sastra) called the Veda. The Śruti says: &ldquo;My dear [Maitreyi], the Ṛg, Yajur, Sāma, and Atharva Vedas, as well as the Itihasas, Purāņas, vidyās, Upanisads, slokas, sūtras, upasūtras, and vyākhyānas all appear from the breathing of the Supreme Being&rdquo; (BAU 2.4.10).?1

Scripture contains various types of unlimited knowledge that are inaccessible through any other means of valid knowing (pramāna), and its source is Brahman alone, as confirmed by scripture itself.

Even liberated beings (mukta-jivas) are not the source of the Vedic knowledge. To establish this, the verse says, &ldquo;about which even great sages are perplexed&rdquo; (muhyanti yat surayaḥ). The pronoun yat (&ldquo;about which&rdquo;) here refers to the Vedic knowl- edge called brahma. The great sages (surayaḥ) [who are also per- plexed about the meaning of the Vedas] include even Seṣa and others.

Now an alternate meaning of sūtra vs 1.1.4 (tat tu samanva- yat) is being given.&rdquo; There is a reason why Bhagavan is the source of the Vedas, and this is explained in this sutra. In the word samanvaya [which can be divided into two parts, sam and anvaya], the prefix sam means &ldquo;complete,&rdquo; or in other words, &ldquo;all-perspectival,&rdquo; and anvaya denotes &ldquo;perfect knowledge.&rdquo; So samanvayat means, &ldquo;He from whom is derived the complete knowledge or realization (parijñāna) of the meaning of the Vedas.&rdquo; This entity is ascertained as the womb (yoni), or in other words, the repository of the scripture. This signifies on the one hand that the jiva is certainly not in possession of complete knowledge, and on the other that pradhana is strictly uncon- scious [indicating that neither of them can be the source of the Veda, śästra-yoni]. As the Śruti says, &ldquo;He knows whatever is to be known, and yet of Him there is no knower&rdquo; (su 3.19).96

In Jiva Gosvāmi&rsquo;s reading of this verse, the word viśvam appears in place of the word vedyam. Vedyam means &ldquo;the knowable,&rdquo; and viśvam means &ldquo;the cosmos&rdquo; hor &ldquo;the totality.&rdquo; The sense is the same regardless of which reading is accepted,
because &ldquo;the knowable&rdquo; refers to the totality of all phenomena, and such totality is nothing other than the cosmos.

is intrinsically self-endowed with complete knowledge of the Veda, the verse indicates the lack of such complete knowledge in all jivas whatsoever by the phrase, &ldquo;about which even great sages are perplexed&rdquo; (muhyanti yat surayaḥ). Even learned sages, such as Seșa, are perplexed as to the meaning of the divine sound rev- elation (sabda-brahma). This is described by Svayam Bhagavan, Śrī Kṛṣṇa Himself:
किं विधत्ते किमाचष्टे किमनूद्य विकल्पयेत् ।
इत्यस्या हृदयं लोके नान्यो मद् वेद कश्चन ॥ ३०९ ॥ इति ।
ल
No one in the world besides Me knows the heart [i.e., the inner mystery] of the Veda, what it enjoins and prohibits in its karma- kāṇḍa portion, what it reveals through mantras and aphorisms in its portion dealing with the worship of gods, and what it con- 1cludes after examining various alternatives in its jñāna-kāṇḍa
division. (SB 11.21.42)97

By this also, Bhagavan alone has been directly described. Now an alternate meaning of sūtra vs 1.1.5 (ikṣater näsabdam) is illu- mined by the word abhijña itself. The meaning of the sutra is as follows: The Śruti says, &ldquo;He is devoid of speech (aśabda), untouchable, formless, and imperishable&rdquo; (KU 1.3.15),98 so how can He be the source of words in the form of sabda or the Veda
(sabda-yoni)? hibians

correlates to the Upanisadic statement, &ldquo;He glanced [with the resolve]: &lsquo;Let Me become many, let Me procreate&rdquo; (tad aikṣata bahu syām prajayeya, CHU 6.2.3). Here the use of the verbal root Viks, &ldquo;to see,&rdquo; is linguistic in nature (śabdatmaka), cor- responding to the expressed intention &ldquo;Let Me become many (bahu syām).&rdquo;

All of this is indicated [in SB 1.1.1] by the word abhijña, &ldquo;who is fully cognizant of everything,&rdquo; or in other words, &ldquo;He who is highly skilled in the art of reflection, which is linguistic in nature.&rdquo; This is expressed in statements such as, &ldquo;Let Me become many.&rdquo; Furthermore, this totality of His energies in the form of speech is not material, because it existed even prior to the orig- inal impulsion of prakṛti. To indicate that these energies exist within His essential being, the verse describes Him as svarāț, &ldquo;self-resplendent.&rsquo;

Here also, as before, it is established that He has attributes and form. As the author of the Brahma-sutra says, &ldquo;The One who exists within [the eye and the sun] is not a jiva but Paramātmā, because the attributes that are taught therein [in Chandogya
99 The word sabdatmaka literally means &ldquo;of the nature of language or sound.&rdquo; Bhagavan&rsquo;s seeing capacity is referred to in vs 1.1.5 by the word ikṣateḥ, Sindicating that He glanced at the unmanifest pradhana prior to the onset of
creation. His seeing capacity is said to be linguistic in nature, because it includes the intent to manifest the creation, as expressed in the direct verbal affirmation, &ldquo;Let Me become many (bahu syam).&rdquo; In Indian linguistic theory, thoughts, ideas, and intentions belong to the pre-verbal dimension of articulated speech. Since Bhagavan&rsquo;s &ldquo;linguistic seeing&rdquo; occurs prior to the material manifestation, it is transphenomenal in nature. It is, therefore, concluded that Bhagavan is intrinsically endowed with linguistic potency by which He is the source of the Vedic sound (sabda), and yet He is devoid of phenomenal speech (aśabda).

Upanisad] are applicable only to Brahman&rdquo; (vs 1.1.20). There- fore, when it is said that Brahman is devoid of speech (aśabda) [as in the statement of Katha Upanisad cited above], it should be understood to mean that Brahman is devoid of material speech alone.

In this verse, the meaning of the four chapters of the Uttara- mīmāmsā [i.e., the Brahma-sutra] has also been pointed out: That of the first chapter (&ldquo;Reconciliation,&rdquo; or samanvaya) is given in the words, &ldquo;who is concluded to be the foundational source through the import (artheșu) of all the various types of Vedic statements, be they affirmative (anvayat) or disaffirma- tive (itaratah)&rdquo; (anvayad itaratas ca); the second chapter (&ldquo;Non- contradiction,&rdquo; or avirodha) is indicated by the words, &ldquo;about which even great sages are perplexed&rdquo; (muhyanti yat surayaḥ); the third chapter (&ldquo;The Means,&rdquo; or sadhana), by the words, &ldquo;Let us meditate&rdquo; (dhimahi); and the fourth (&ldquo;The Result,&rdquo; or phala), by the words, &ldquo;the Supreme Truth&rdquo; (satyam param).
Commentary
اطلا
Śrī Jiva offers an alternative meaning to the third, fourth, and fifth Brahma-sūtras to show that Brahman is the source of the Vedas. The Vedas are not a composition of any mortal being, as conceived by modern scholars, neither are they independent of Bhagavan, as imagined by the Purva-mimāṁsakas, nor are they material speech, as assumed by Advaitavadīs. Since Bhagavan is the source of the Vedas, He alone knows their real import. This is affirmed by Śrī Kṛṣṇa: &ldquo;I am the author and knower of the Vedas&rdquo; (GĪTĀ 15.15).100
When it is said that Brahman is devoid of speech (asabda), as in the statement of Katha Upanisad (1.3.15), it implies two things: that
100 vedanta-kṛd veda-vid eva caham long go
741
IV Determination of Bhagavan as the Subject of

the Absolute Truth is devoid of material speech, and that It is not devoid of transphenomenal speech, meaning that It is intrinsically endowed with the capacity to think linguistically and also speak. When it is said that Bhagavan willed to become many (bahu syam), this intention itself is linguistic in nature (sabdatmaka). Thoughts and intentions are pre-verbalized or subtle forms of articulated speech.
Since Bhagavan willed to become many prior to the manifes- tation of the cosmos, His speech in the form of this intention is not material. This is intimated by the word svarāț in the Bhāga- vata Purana verse. Because His ideation and will to create are prior to the creative act, He must have complete knowledge of every- thing. Thus, only He can be the source of the Vedas. The Vedas or śästra provide knowledge that is not available by any other means. According to Sankarācārya, the Vedas and their corollary litera- ture, such as the Smṛtis, Itihāsas, and Purānas, are the śästra101 This is accepted by all Vedanta schools.
des
A jiva cannot be the source of the Vedas, because in the condi- tioned state, he is under the influence of ignorance. Moreover, he can attain liberation only by realizing Bhagavan, as stated in Śvetă- śvatara Upanisad (3.8), &ldquo;By knowing Him alone, one transcends death. There is no other means by which to proceed.&ldquo;102 He can be known only if and when He chooses to reveal Himself. Śrī Kṛṣṇa affirms that no one knows Him (mām tu veda na kaścana, GĪTĀ 7.26), and that He can be known only by unalloyed devotion (bhaktyäham ekayā grāhyaḥ, SB 11.14.21). Bhagavan discloses this knowledge in śastra. Thus, a jīva cannot be the source of the Vedas. This is con- firmed in the verse under discussion, because it declares that even great sages (surayah) are perplexed as to the meaning of the Vedas.
Śrī Jiva Gosvāmi explains that the essence of the entire Brahma- sūtra is contained in the first verse of the Bhagavata Purana. The

105 Bhāgavata Purana as the Natural Commentary
on Brahma-sutra and Gayatri
Vedanta contains 556 sutras divided into four chapters, called sama- nvaya (Reconciliation), avirodha (Non-Contradiction), sadhana (The Means), and phala (The End Result). The first chapter estab- lishes that the import of all the Vedas is in Brahman; the second refutes opinions contrary to Vedanta propounded by other philo- sophical schools; the third explains the process for realizing Brah- man; and the fourth describes the results of realizing Brahman. Since the Bhāgavata Purana is the natural commentary of the Brahma-sutra, the essence of all these topics can be found in its first verse.
Jiva Gosvāmī points out that the scriptural reconciliation (sama- nvaya) is indicated by the words anvayad itaratas ca, whose self- evident object is Bhagavan. The entity signified by samanvaya can be disclosed only through revealed sound (sabda) and not by any other means. Even great sages who do not acknowledge the authority of sabda are perplexed as to its true import (muhyanti yat sürayaḥ). Śrī Jiva connects the latter phrasing to the sec- ond chapter (avirodha), because it implies that the self-revealed Vedic sabda stands uncontradicted by the philosophical views pro- pounded by all such sages. The word dhimahi is correlated to the third chapter (sadhana), indicating that bhakti, or devotion, is the self-illuminating means to realization of the Absolute. The result attained is the Supreme Personal Absolute, referred to as satyam param, corresponding to the fourth chapter (phala). sagluis Thus, it has been rightly said that the Bhagavata Purāņa is the natural explanation on the Brahma-sutras, presented by their author himself.

The meaning of Gayatri has also been made clear [in the Bhāga- vata Purana verse]. The meaning of pranava (Om) [i.e., the divine creative pulsation] is expressed by the words janmädy asya yataḥ, &ldquo;from whom this cosmos emanates,&rdquo; because they signify that the Absolute is intrinsically self-endowed with the potency for creation, sustenance, and dissolution. This is also confirmed in Agni Purana in the explanation of Gayatri: &ldquo;That effulgence is Bhagavan Viṣṇu, who is the source of the creation, sustenance, and dissolution of the cosmos&rdquo; (AP 216.7B).103
“यत्र त्रिसर्गोऽमृषा&rdquo; इति व्याहृतित्र्यार्थः । उभयत्रापि लोकत्रयस्य तदनन्यत्वेन विवक्षि- तत्वात् ।
The meaning of the three vyähṛtis [the three mystical words uttered after Om in Gayatri, bhūḥ, bhuvaḥ, and svaḥ] is expressed by the words, yatra trisargo&rsquo;mṛṣā, &ldquo;in whom the threefold cre- ation is a real emergence.&rdquo; In both descriptions, the intention is to say that the threefold divisions of the universe are not distinct from the Absolute [i.e., they are real effects of a real cause].

The word svarăț, &ldquo;self-resplendent,&rdquo; signifies the supremely effulgent One, the illuminator of the sun [savituḥ].

That Purana is known as Śrimad Bhagavatam which delineates the path of Ultimate Truth (dharma-vistara) with reference to the Gayatri mantra and which tells of the killing of the demon Vrtra. (MP 53.20; AP 272.6)108

Therefore, it is to be understood that although the Absolute is described in different places with reference to different names, such as Bharga, Brahman, Para, Visņu, and Bhagavan, they all establish only Bhagavan. In the midst of these descriptions, however, we also find the instruction to perform ahangraho- pāsanā, or meditation on oneself as the Supreme. This is rec- ommended because the eligibility to worship Bhagavan comes about only by acquiring a nature that is similar to His. ad

Bhāgavata Purāņa as the Natural Commentary
on Brahma-sutra and Gayatri
Commentary Deathld nowis
The first verse of Bhagavata Purana, besides giving the gist of the Brahma-sutra, also supplies the meaning of the Gayatri mantra, which is chanted daily by the dvijas, the twice-born. The Gayatri mantra is said to be the essence of the Vedas as well as being called the mother of the Vedas (Atharva Veda 19.17.1).
The term Gayatri refers to the meter. It contains twenty-four syllables and was revealed to the sage Viśvāmitra. It is found in the Ṛg Veda (93.62.10). It is also called Savitṛ Gayatri to distinguish it from the Gayatri of other deities, such as that of Ganesa, whose composition follows the same metrical pattern as that of Savitr Gayatri. It is the primary mantra into which the young brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, and vaisya boys are initiated at the ages of eight, eleven, and twelve years, respectively. Initiation into the mystery of this mantra is known as second birth, and the student begins the study of the Veda after that.

toward Bhagavan alone. This explanation is thus in harmony with the meaning of the first verse of the Bhāgavatam as given by him. Gayatri is the essence of the Vedas and the Bhāgavata Purana, as well as an explanation of Brahma-sutra, which is the cream of the Vedas. As such, it is fitting that its meaning should be found in the first verse.

In the upasana-śāstra, there is a principle that in order to worship a Deity, one must first become of the nature of the Deity (devam bhūtvā devam yajet, or, nadevo devam arcayet). Any statements that declare that one should meditate on oneself as nondifferent from the Deity- a practice technically called ahangrahopāsanā - have this intention. if awollol noii.quos

Finally, aśraya (the ultimate shelter) is denoted by the words satyam param (the Supreme Truth).

Moreover, that ultimate shelter, having been established as Svayam Bhagavan, is none other than Śrī Kṛṣṇa. This has been made evident by the arguments given above. So, in this introduc- tory statement of the Bhagavatam, from each and every word, sentence, and their import, it is clear that the Bhāgavatam&rsquo;s object of meditation [Śrī Kṛṣṇa] is intrinsically self-endowed with qualities, transcendental form, and all the characteris- tics of Bhagavan. This is indeed proper, because it is demon- strated later by other statements that disclose His intrinsic being (svarupa), such as:

Furthermore, because the meaning of the introductory state- ment depends upon [i.e., is determined by] the meaning of the concluding statement, the latter should not be transgressed [by the former]. This manner of specifying the Supreme Truth [mentioned only in generic terms as satyam param in SB 1.1.1] is evidenced in verse SB 12.13.19 [as discussed in Anuccheda 105.1]. Just as in Sankarācārya&rsquo;s alternate explanation of Brahma- sūtra 3.3.16 [appearing in his commentary on the succeeding

sutra (3.3.17)], the word sat (&ldquo;the Supreme Existent&rdquo;), mentioned in the introductory statement, is understood to mean &ldquo;the Self&rdquo; (ātmā), because of the latter&rsquo;s use in the concluding statement.
तद्वदिहापि चतुःश्लोकीवक्तुर्भगवत्त्वं दर्शितं च श्रीव्याससमाधावपि तस्यैव ध्येयत्वम् । तदेतदेव च “स्वसुखनिभृत” (भा० १२।१२।६८) इत्यादि श्रीशुकदेवहृदयानुगतमिति ॥ श्रीव्यासः ॥
By the same principle, here also [in SB 12.13.19], the speaker of the four seed verses of the Bhagavatam [identified in the open- ing verse only in generic terms as satyam param] is determined to be Bhagavan. He alone, moreover, has been shown to be the self-revealed object of meditation even in Śrī Vyasa&rsquo;s state of supracognitive trance (samadhi). This too is the very truth that accords with the heart of Sri Sukadeva, as described in verses such as: &ldquo;I offer my obeisances unto Śrīla Vyasadeva&rsquo;s son, Śrī Śuka, who destroys all sins. Although his consciousness was completely filled with the bliss of self-realization, and though he had consequently cast off all other feelings and thoughts, his essence (sāra) was irresistibly drawn to the enchanting divine play (lilä) of Lord Ajita, Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Out of compassion, he thus delineated this Purāṇa, which illumines Reality&rdquo; (SB 12.12.68).111

riters According to Sukadeva, the prime speaker of the Bhāgavatam, there are ten topics discussed therein, namely, sarga, visarga, sthāna, poṣaṇa, ūti, manvantara, iśānukatha, nirodha, mukti, and āśraya. These have been discussed at length in Tattva Sandarbha, Anucchedas 56-59. All these topics can be identified in the first verse, as shown in this anuccheda. The tenth item, aśraya (the ulti- mate shelter), is the primary topic, whereas the other nine serve

only to elucidate it (SB 2.10.2). The tenth topic is Bhagavan Śrī Kṛṣṇa, which was established in Tattva Sandarbha (Anuccheda 61). This very topic, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, is the import of the first verse, although spoken of indirectly.
Śrī Jiva, therefore, cites another verse (SB 10.87.50), wherein Śrī Śuka specifies the meaning of the first verse more directly. This verse clearly recommends meditation on Hari, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, who is the source of the creation, sustenance, and dissolution of the cos- mos, the regulator of the jivas and primordial nature, the Imma- nent Self of all living beings, and altogether free from māyā. This verse captures most of the meaning of the first verse in an explicit manner. In this way, Śrī Jiva shows that the import of the opening statement of the Bhāgavata Purana is Bhagavan Śrī Kṛṣṇa.
sique
In addition to this, Śrī Jiva asserts that the meaning of satyam param as Bhagavan is also understood from the second verse, wherein it is said that Iśvara becomes bound in the heart of a per- son who simply wishes to hear Bhagavata Purana. This is possible only if Iśvara is the central focus of the book. If the import of the book were in Brahman or some other deity, then it would be Brah- man or that other deity who should become situated in the heart of the listener instead. all wed by botherh
Next, Jiva takes up a discussion of the meaning of the conclud- ing part of the book. Since the opening and concluding statements are correlated, their meanings must be in harmony. Here both assertions recommend meditation on the Supreme Truth, satyam
param.
The concluding verse informs us that the Supreme Absolute (satyam param) spoke this Bhāgavata Purana (in the form of four seed verses, called catuḥ-sloki) to Brahma. This speaker cannot have been unqualified Brahman. He must have been a transphe- nomenal sentient being, endowed with personhood, form, affect, and qualities, such as omniscience. Consequently, the speaker must have been none other than Bhagavan, because no one else existed prior to the unfolding of creation. This is confirmed from the narration found in the ninth chapter of the Second Canto of Brahma&rsquo;s receiving the Bhāgavatam in seed form from Bhagavan.
754
105 Bhāgavata Purana as the Natural Commentary
on Brahma-sutra and Gayatri
It is a hermeneutical principle of textual interpretation that the concluding statement of a book should not be contradicted by the opening statement. By this norm, the concluding statement can be examined to help specify whatever is set forth in general terms in the opening statement. Śrī Jiva offers an example from Sanka- rācārya&rsquo;s commentary to Brahma-sutra 3.3.16, wherein it is affirmed that the posterior statement establishes the meaning of the word sat, found in the opening statement [sad eva saumyedam agra āsīd ekam eva advitiyam, CHU 6.2.1], as ātmā [the Supreme Self], because it has been used in that sense in the closing statement (tat-satyam sa ātmā tat tvam asi, CHU 6.8.7).lenge ati gaiythage tuorliw sav
The sense is as follows. The word sat is used in mantra CHU 6.2.1, but it is not clear what its intended meaning is within that con- text. It could signify Hiranyagarbha, Paramātmā, Brahman, or some other entity. But if the concluding statement is understood to be in harmony with the opening statement, then the word sat is specified as referring to the Supreme Self (ātmā). In general cases, the principle applied is that the opening statement should set the meaning of the concluding statement.&ldquo;12 But if the open- ing statement is ambiguous, then it is the concluding statement that determines the meaning of the opening statement. This is confirmed by Vacaspati Miśra in his famous commentary called Bhamati (3.3.17)113
In the case of the Bhāgavata Purana, the phrase satyam param, used in verse SB 1.1.1, is ambiguous. Like the word sat of Chandogya Upanisad (6.2.1), it can have numerous meanings. This is evident from the various commentaries available on this verse. The same phrase is also found in verse SB 12.13.19, which constitutes the con- cluding chapter of the book. From the latter verse, however, it is clear that this satyam param spoke the four-versed Bhāgavatam to Brahma (kasmai yena vibhāsito&rsquo;yam).

IV Determination of Bhagavan as the Subject of Bhagavata Purāṇa
Canto, we then learn that it was Bhagavan who spoke the four- versed Bhagavatam. Brahma personally informed Narada that the book was spoken to him by Bhagavan (SB 2.7.51). Sūta also confirms the same (SB 12.13.10). This correlation of prior and posterior state- ments establishes the meaning of satyam param in SB 12.13.19 as Bha- gavan. Because the opening verse cannot transgress the conclud- ing verse, the meaning of satyam param in verse SB 1.1.1 must be Bhagavan alone, and no one else.
By this logic, it is confirmed that it is Bhagavan who revealed the knowledge of the Vedas to Brahma, an event mentioned in the first verse without specifying its speaker. This conclusion is further validated by the samadhi of Vyasa before he composed the Bhāga- vata Purana, in which the Purna Puruşa, the Complete Person, was self-revealed to him.&rdquo; Since it was the Complete Person who was seen by Vyasa, it is He alone who is to be meditated on. Thus, the Supreme Truth (satyam param) refers to the Purna Purusa.
In addition, there is the case of Sukadeva. Although he was utterly established in Brahman-awareness from birth, his heart became captivated by the narrations of the enchanting divine play of Śrī Kṛṣṇa. From that moment onward, devotion to Śrī Kṛṣṇa was born in him, and he took up the study of the Bhagavata Purāna. This also fortifies the conclusion that the subject matter of the Bhāgavatam is Bhagavan Śrī Kṛṣṇa and not unqualified Brahman.

Now, the meaning of the concluding statement [SB 12.13.19]1 is given. The word kasmai means &ldquo;unto Brahma,&rdquo; who was seated on the lotus sprouted from the navel of Garbhodakaśāyi Puruṣa. In that very place, the Srimad Bhagavatam was revealed (vibhā- sitah) to him by Bhagavan, who was endowed with the divine form described in the Second Canto. Bhagavan did so while dis- playing Maha-Vaikuntha (to Brahma). The verb vibhāsita, &ldquo;it was revealed,&rdquo; signifies that the Bhagavatam was not composed even at that time by Him (Bhagavan). The pronoun ayam (this) refers to [the peerless lamp of knowledge] in the form of Srimad Bhagavatam. The word pură (&ldquo;in the distant past&rdquo;) means &ldquo;at the beginning of the first half of Brahma&rsquo;s life.&rdquo;

The compound tad-rupena, &ldquo;in that form,&rdquo; means, &ldquo;in the form of Brahma&rdquo; [Bhagavan later disclosed the Bhāgavatam to Nārada]. Tad-rūpiņā, &ldquo;in that form,&rdquo; means, &ldquo;in the form of Nārada&rdquo; [Bhagavan then disclosed the Bhagavatam to Vyasa]. The compound tad-atmană, &ldquo;in His own form,&rdquo; means, “in the form of Kṛṣṇa-dvaipayana Vyasa&rdquo; [He disclosed the Bhāgavatam] to the master of yogis, Śrī Suka.

The compound tad-atmană, &ldquo;in His own form,&rdquo; is also to be syntactically connected with the immediately succeeding com- pound [bhagavad-rätäya]. Its meaning would then be, &ldquo;in the form of Suka&rdquo; [He disclosed the Bhagavatam to Bhagavad-rāta, Parikṣit]. The three compounds - tad-rupena, tad-rūpiņā, and tad-ātmanā - indicate that He revealed not only the Bhagava- tam condensed into its four seed verses, but by empowering each [subsequent] speaker, He revealed the complete Purāṇa. Here, although out of modesty Suta does not say, &ldquo;and in the form of myself [He disclosed it] unto you,&rdquo; such a statement is to be understood to complete the sense. eingia

In this way, the glory of all the teachers of the Sri Bhagavatam has been shown. The chain of succession [of the Bhāgavatam] stemming from Lord Sankarṣaṇa, however, is included in the revelation brought forth by Sri Kṛṣṇa-dvaipayana. Therefore, it is not stated explicitly in the verse.

The clause, &ldquo;Let us meditate on the Supreme Truth (param satyam),&rdquo; means &ldquo;let us meditate on the Reality (tattva) called Śrī Bhagavan.&rdquo; This is also corroborated by the Sahasra-nama- stotra, which states, &ldquo;He who is Supreme (param) is unsur- passed by anyone&rdquo; (yat tat param anuttamam). According to this declaration, the word param means &ldquo;Śri Bhagavan alone.&rdquo; [That the word param refers to Bhagavan is also understood] from the Second Canto, &ldquo;The Purusa is the first avatara of Para, or Bhagavan&rdquo; (SB 2.6.41)?

Because the Bhāgavatam is described as the inspirer of the intel- lectual faculty of Brahma and others, and because this book is introduced and concluded by dhimahi, which is an indicator of the Gayatri mantra, it (Bhāgavata Purana) illuminates the meaning of Gayatri also.

of creation. Brahma later imparted this knowledge to Nārada, who instructed Vyasa. Vyasa, in turn, taught it to his son Suka (SB 2.9.43-45). In verse SB 12.13.19, it is reiterated that Bhagavan spoke this knowledge to Brahma directly, and then as Brahma to Nārada, as Nārada to Vyasa, and as Vyasa to Suka. The compound tad-atmană is to be applied to both Vyasa and Suka.
From this, it is understood that even when other teachers imparted the Bhāgavata Purana, the actual preceptor was Bhaga- vän, assuming each of their forms, or inspiring each one of them from within. The teacher of the Bhāgavatam is Bhagavan Himself. This reveals the super-excellent position of this Purāna. Tradition- ally in India, a Bhāgavatam teacher is honored as the representative of Bhagavan.
The word vibhāsita (in SB 12.13.19) means &ldquo;revealed.&rdquo; This implies that the Bhagavatam already pre-existed in the heart of Bhagavan, and thus, it is eternal like the Veda. It is for this rea- son that the Bhāgavatam is said to be equal to the Veda, brahma- sammita, in SB 1.3.40, SB 2.1.8, and SB 2.8.28. Similarly, in SB 1.4.7, it is directly referred to as śruti; in SB 1.1.3, as the fruit of the wish- fulfilling tree of the Veda; and in SB 12.13.15, as the embodiment of the essence of all Vedanta. He revealed the complete
In Chapter 8 of the Third Canto, an additional disciplic succes- sion for the Bhāgavata Purana is given. According to that descrip- tion, Lord Sankarṣana spoke it to the Kumāra brothers, who in turn taught it to Sankhyāyana, who gave it to the sages Parāśara and Bṛhaspati. Sage Parāśara taught it to Maitreya, who in turn spoke it to Vidura. In this succession also, the original speaker is Bhagavan and not unqualified Brahman.
The verb dhimahi, &ldquo;Let us meditate,&rdquo; is the distinguishing char- acteristic of the Gayatri mantra. This mantra is a prayer to Bha- gavan, in which the supplicant appeals for his intelligence to be inspired. Both the opening and concluding verses of the Bhāgavata Purana contain the word dhimahi, signifying that it is an expansion of the meaning of the Gayatri mantra.
The other verb used in this mantra is pracodayāt, &ldquo;may He
760
106 Bhagavan Himself Is the Teacher of Bhagavata Purāņa
inspire.&rdquo; This notion of inspiration is also contained in the open- ing and concluding verses of the Bhagavatam. In the first verse it is indicated by the words &ldquo;He revealed the Veda to the first seer [Brahma] by inspiration through his heart&rdquo; (tene brahma-hṛdā ya adikavaye). In the concluding verse (SB 12.13.19), it is implied by the fact that Bhagavan transmitted the Bhagavatam in the form of Brahmā, Nārada, and so on. This confirms that these two verses contain the essential meaning of Gayatri.
Gayatri, being a Vedic mantra, is to be chanted only by a dvija, one who has undergone the upanayana saṁskāra. The Bhāgavata Purāṇa, however, is available to everyone, even to those who are not dvijas. Consequently, Śrī Vyasa does not disclose the full Gaya- tri mantra in its original form, but indirectly, implicit within the first verse and one of the concluding verses. Both of these verses embody the meaning of Gayatri.
Moreover, the first verse of the Bhāgavatam relates that Bha- gavän revealed the Vedic knowledge, enfolded within the Gaya- tri mantra, from within the illumined heart of Brahma. In addi- tion, the ninth chapter of the Second Canto informs us that Bha- gavan spoke the four-versed Bhāgavatam to Brahma. These two facts taken together also indicate that the Bhāgavata Purana is the explanation of Gayatri, because this is the book that was revealed in Brahma&rsquo;s heart.

Nārāyaṇa, or Visņu, its sustainer. In other scriptures, Akhileśa [in such forms] is either not celebrated at all or only on occa- sion, but certainly not continuously (abhikṣaṇa). The word tu (however) is used in a restrictive sense [i.e., &ldquo;only here&rdquo;]. Bha- gavän Himself [in His original form] is continuously glorified only here (iha) in the Bhāgavata Purāṇa.
नारायणादयो वा येऽत्र वर्णितास्तेऽप्यशेषा एव मूर्तयोऽवतारा यस्य सः । तथाभूत एव गीयते न त्वितरत्रेव तदविवेकेनेत्यर्थः । अत एव तत्तत्कथाप्रसङ्गैरप्यनुपदं पदं पदमपि लक्ष्यीकृत्य भगवानेव परि सर्वतोभावेन पठितो व्यक्तमेवोक्त इति ।
Other manifestations of Bhagavan, such as Nārāyaṇa, that are described herein, are the unlimited forms or avatāras of Him. So it is Bhagavan, precisely of that nature, who is celebrated [in Bhāgavata Purāṇa], not as in other scriptures [where mention is made] without proper discrimination [between His original form and other forms]. Therefore, through various episodes, in each and every word or at every turn, Bhagavan alone is thoroughly, in all aspects, explicitly discussed.laimoles

The Supreme Personal Absolute in His original form and nature (Svayam Bhagavan) is repeatedly described in Bhagavata Purana through stories, prayers, and philosophical dialogues. This is shown in detail in Kṛṣṇa Sanda- rbha (Anucchedas 44-76). The distinction between Sākṣāt Bhagavān and His avatāras has also been made clear in numerous places in the Bhāgavata Purana, particularly Chapters 1.3 and 10.14.

Commentary
MA

ARTHA-VADA, or glorification, is the fifth indicator of a book&rsquo;s pur- port- that which is praised the most in a book must be its princi- pal subject. This verse illustrates that Bhagavan is praised even by Brahma and Śiva. He is the subject sung of in the Vedas.
The six Vedāngas are sikṣā (phonetics), kalpa (the rules concern- ing ceremonial acts), vyakarana (grammar), jyotisa (astronomy), chandas (prosody), and nirukta (etymology). Knowledge of these is necessary to understand the meaning of the Vedic Samhitas. The Vedic sūktas are sung in different sequences, such as pada-pāṭha, krama-pāṭha, and jäta-pāṭha. This is indicated in the verse by the words pada and krama. S o
ISTOS
Nobody can know Bhagavan fully, as Kṛṣṇa declares in sev- eral places in Bhagavad Gita: &ldquo;Nobody knows Me&rdquo; (mām tu veda na kaścana, 7.26). Although the Supreme Deity (deva) to whom Śrī Sūta bows down in this verse remains unnamed in order to high- light His unknowability, we can infer that Suta is referring to Śrī Kṛṣṇa, because he prays to Him explicitly in verses 20 and 23 of this same final chapter of the Bhagavatam. obibam to collite
From this and many similar verses of glorification, we can infer that the subject matter of the Bhagavata Purana is Bhagavan Śrī Kṛṣṇa.

2 The syntactical problem being clarified is that the compound and mor dhyānävasthita-tad-gatena contains two separate adjectival compounds, abov dhyānāvasthita and tad-gata. So Jiva reads avasthita, &ldquo;situated,&rdquo; as &ldquo;motionless or fixed&rdquo; (niścala). Stuvanti is given as the correct grammatical form of stunvanti.

Bhagavan Sri Hari is indicated as immanent within all living beings through His own self-expansion.

objects (drsyaih) of subjective awareness. [Śuka] demonstrates that this [reasoning process] has two aspects: Firstly, it is impos- sible for perceptible inert objects, such as the intellect, to be observed without a self-luminous seer. Thus, through the fail- ure of proof by any other means (anupapatti), [a conscious seer is inferred] by corresponding indications (lakṣaṇaih) that point to a self-luminous seer. Secondly, such clues lead to the infer- ence [of a seer], due to the invariable concomitance (vyapti) that the intellect and so on are to be engaged by an agent, because they are instruments or tools, like an axe.

Thereafter, Bhagavan is also indicated [as the seer]. By what evi- dence? Because of His entry into all living beings, who are indi- viduated seers (drastr), by virtue of His &ldquo;own self-expansion&rdquo; (svātmanā), namely, through His partial expansion in the form of the Immanent Self (antaryämi).
आदौ सर्वैर्द्रष्टृभिरन्तर्यामी लक्षितः । ततस्तेन भगवानपि लक्षित इत्यर्थः । स च स च पूर्व- वत् द्विधैव लक्ष्यते । तथा हि कर्तृत्वभोक्तृत्वयोरस्वातन्त्र्यदर्शनात् कर्मणोऽपि जडत्वात् सर्वेषामपि जीवानां तत्र तत्र प्रवृत्तिरन्तः प्रयोजकविशेषं विना न घटत इत्यनुपपत्तिद्वा- रान्तर्यामी लक्ष्यते । “एष ह्यनेनात्मना चक्षुषा दर्शयति । श्रोत्रेण श्रावयति । मनसा मनयति । बुद्ध्या बोधयति । तस्मादेतावाहुः सृतिरसृतिः” इति भाल्लवेयश्रुतिश्च ।
I
The meaning is that first the Immanent Self (antaryāmi) is indi- cated by the totality of individuated seers (drastr), and, there- after, Bhagavan is also indicated by that Immanent Self. Addi- tionally, both the Immanent Self and Bhagavan are indicated in two ways, as explained above: Firstly, because agency and experiential capacity [in the jivas] are not observed to be inde- pendent, and also because karma is inert, the involvement of all jivas in their respective actions is not possible without a dis- tinct inner impeller. By this failure of proof by any other means (anupapatti), the Immanent Self is indicated. There is also the following statement from Bhallaveya-śruti in this regard: &ldquo;He, indeed, by this Self [i.e., the antaryami] impels the jiva to see by

Therefore, these two [the jiva and Paramātmā] are said to be [respectively] &rsquo;the movable&rsquo; [sṛti, i.e., the knowable] and &rsquo;the immovable&rsquo; [asṛti, i.e., the unknowable].&rdquo;

Now, if a certain [unspecified] Supreme Being (ko&rsquo;pi parah) were to enter into the jivas with the totality of all of His parts [i.e., in His utter completion] in order to discharge the controlling agency (aiśvarya) that is the sole jurisdiction of [His partial power only as] the Immanent Self, then His independent iden- tity as Iśvara would indeed no longer remain, due to the absence of completeness in His own intrinsic being. From the impossi- bility of this line of argumentation (anupapatti), Bhagavan is also indicated by virtue of His partial expansion in the form of the Immanent Self. Therefore, it is stated in the Gitopanisad:

IV Determination of
of Bhagavan as the Subject of Bhāgavata Purāņa
तथा जीवाः प्रयोजककर्तृप्रेरितव्यापाराः । अस्वातन्त्र्यात् तक्षादिकर्मकरजनवदित्येवम- न्तर्यामिणि तत्त्वे व्याप्तिद्वारा सिद्धे पुनस्तेनैव भगवानपि साध्यते ।
[Now the second inference in regard to the existence of the Immanent Self and Bhagavan is given.] Because the living beings (jivas) are not independent, they can accomplish their respective actions only on being impelled by an [inner] animat- ing agent. This is comparable [in part] to a laborer, such as a carpenter, who works under the order of his employer. So, after thus establishing the existence of the Immanent Self through the invariable concomitance (vyapti) [of instruments and their agents], Bhagavan is also authenticated once again by the same invariable concomitance [of the part (i.e., Paramātmā) and its all-encompassing Whole (i.e., Bhagavan)].
तुच्छवैभवजीवान्तर्यामिस्वरूपमीश्वरतत्त्वं निजांशितत्त्वाश्रयं तथैव पर्याप्तेः । राजप्रभु- त्वाश्रिततक्षकादिकर्मकरप्रयोजकप्रभुत्वादिवदिति । अथवात्र (भा० ३ । ३२।३३) -
[The inference of Bhagavan is as follows:] The Supreme Abso- lute&rsquo;s regulating feature (iśvara-tattva) in the form of the Immanent Self of all living entities (jiva-antaryāmi), being endowed with but limited power, is under the shelter of its all- encompassing Whole (amsi-tattva) [i.e., Bhagavan]. This is due to the fact that Iśvara&rsquo;s divinity finds its ultimate conclusion only in the Complete Whole, just as the authority of a manager who engages a carpenter depends on the authority of the king. Alternatively, in this context, the following verse should be cited:
ofter, Bh

Iv Determination of Bhagavan as the Subject of Bhagavata Purāṇa
raised in this regard. Earlier in Anuccheda 105.6, it was estab- lished that logic is not a means of valid knowing in reference to the Absolute. So, how can logic be one of the six indicators?
In reply, it is agreed that logic alone is unreliable. But this does not mean that logic is altogether without utility. Logic is a valu- able tool to help ascertain the meaning of scripture. In comment- ing upon Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu (1.2.17), Śrī Jiva Gosvāmi writes that logic should follow scripture, and that logic independent of scripture is forbidden. He then cites a verse from Vaisnava-tantra, &ldquo;To ascertain the meaning of a scripture by deliberating on earlier and later statements is called logic. One should give up conclusions based purely on dry logic [contrary to scripture].&rdquo; Thus, logic is certainly helpful if it does not contradict scripture.
In this concluding anuccheda, Śrī Jīva cites a verse (SB 2.2.35) spoken by Suka to show how logic also supports the previous indicators. A three-step inference is being used here:

<li>The first step is to establish the existence of the living being, the hejiva, in the body by distinguishing it from perceptible inert Immobjects (dṛśya), including both the gross and subtle bodies. endo Inert objects cannot be perceived without the presence of all erico conscious being as perceiving subject (drastr), since one inerte

<li>The next step is to infer the existence of Paramātmā, a partial expansion of Bhagavan. Since the jivas&rsquo; agency and experien- tial capacity are not observed to be independent, they cannot function without a superior regulator who oversees the results of their actions. This cannot be effected by karma alone, as pro- posed by Mimamsakas, since karma is also inert. Therefore, there must be an Iśvara, or a supreme regulator of all living beings and material nature. This regulator is Paramātmā. 3. The third step is to infer the existence of Bhagavan from that of Paramātmā. Since Paramātmā enacts only the limited func- itions of regulating material nature and the jīvas, there must be

For each stage of the logical argument there are two sets of inferences, all of which are presented in the form of arthāpatti or anyathanupapatti, which means arriving at a conclusion when all other possibilities are exhausted? The inferential statements are as follows:</li>
<li>There is a conscious subject in the body, because inert objects cannot be known without a conscious seer, just as a table cannot view perceive anything.

<li>The jiva must have an inner controller to mete out the result of
its karma, because karma is inert, like a table.</li>
<li>Paramātmā must be an integrated portion of a supreme all- encompassing Whole, because He is incomplete and subordinate, like the manager of a firm.
for the welfare of These statements demonstrate the existence of Bhagavan as superior to primordial nature, the jiva, and even Paramātmā. These conclusions are supported by statements of Bhagavad Gita and Visnu Purana. This is called gati-sāmānya-nyāya, or the subject common to all scriptures. Just as color alone (or form) is the object of everyone&rsquo;s vision, it is Bhagavan alone who is established in all scriptures. Diverse scriptures may offer different information about Bhagavan, but their subject is one only.
Our differentiated senses provide different kinds of percep- tions of one and the same object. For example, the tongue informs us about an object&rsquo;s taste, the eye, about its color and form, and the other senses, about the corresponding perceptual properties of the object. All the senses, however, convey information about one and the same object. In a similar manner, the different schools of
7 See Tattva Sandarbha, Anuccheda 9.

Iv Determination of Bhagavan as the Subject of Bhāgavata Purana
philosophy all speak about the one Absolute Reality. Moreover, the mind is the internal sense that perceives the object in its entirety, unlike a particular sense that provides information only of one specific quality. Similarly, Bhāgavata Purana offers the complete picture of Reality, because it was revealed by the Absolute Himself, unlike other scriptures that are propagated by particular sages.
Gati-sāmānya means that all the Vedic scriptures speak only of one topic, namely, Śrī Bhagavan. Some scriptural references for this are as follows:
The Vedas are intent only upon Krsna (Vasudeva). (SB 1.2.28)&rdquo;
By all the Vedas, I [Kṛṣṇa] alone am to be known. (GĪTĀ 15.15) 10
岸
Throughout the Vedas, the Rāmāyaṇa, the Puranas, and the Maha- bharata, Lord Hari is glorified everywhere, in the beginning, middle, and end. (Mahabharata, Svarga-parva 6.93)11
Thus, it is concluded that Bhagavan is the subject of the Bhāga- vata Purāṇa. Here ends the discussion of the vadanti verse (SB 1.2.11) with which Bhagavat Sandarbha began.
Summary of Śri Paramātma Sandarbha
bas biro
This book contains 110 anucchedas. Śrī Jīva begins the book with a description of Paramātmā as the prime knower of each physi- cal body, distinct from the individual self (Anucchedas 1.1-3). He then explains the three manifestations of Paramātmā, related to the metacosm, the macrocosm, and the microcosm (Anucchedas 2- 7). In Anucchedas 8-18, he describes the three gunavatāras of Param- ātmā and shows that among them, Visnu is supreme and a direct manifestation of Bhagavan.

through Logic - Criterion 6
In Anucchedas 19-47, Śrī Jīva delineates the intrinsic charac- teristics of the pure self, based upon the description given by Jāmātṛ Muni, a follower of Śrī Rāmānujācārya. Thus, in twenty- nine anucchedas, he completes his explanation of Paramātmā&rsquo;s intermediary potency (taṭastha-śakti). In the next eight anucche- das (48-55), he describes the extrinsic potency (bahiranga-sakti), specifically in terms of its two primary divisions as instrumental (nimitta) and constituent (upādāna) causes of the cosmos. The cos- mos itself is shown to be a real product of Paramātmā&rsquo;s real māyā potency (Anucchedas 56-57).
From Anuccheda 58 onward, Śrī Jiva addresses the vivarta-vāda view of Advaitavada and establishes śakti-pariņāma-vāda as the principle enunciated in Bhagavata Purana. This is an important issue because the prescribed means of attainment (abhidheya) depends upon its clarification. Śrī Jiva elaborates on this topic in detail, concluding it in Anuccheda 81. From Anucchedas 82-92, the topic of maya&rsquo;s relation to the jiva and Paramātmā is examined. The topic of the jiva&rsquo;s bondage and liberation is central to this dis- cussion. Liberation is concluded to be possible only by the grace of Bhagavan. The next subject (Anucchedas 93-104) concerns Bhaga- vān&rsquo;s impartial nature. Bhagavan acts exclusively for the welfare of His devotees, and so the functions of creation, sustenance, and dissolution occur merely as a side effect of that. Beginning from Anuccheda 105 until the end of the book (Anuccheda 110), Śrī Jīva demonstrates, using six indicators, that the subject of Bhāgavata Purana is Bhagavan.

The Language of Transcendence - Key Terms and Concepts
by Navadvip Das (Bruce Martin)
loadA
IN THE WORK OF TRANSLATING THE SANDARBHAS, careful atten- tion has been given to the language used to convey specific terms and concepts. The emphasis has been on maintaining consistency with the overall theme of the work and, in particular, with the specific vision developed by Śrī Jīva Gosvāmi. The Sat Sandarbha, also known as Bhagavata Sandarbha, is no ordinary exposition of theism, for it defines Bhagavan in terms of nondual consciousness (advaya-jñāna). By so doing, it opens the field of investigation of nondual reality to new insights, and so creates a basis for interface with other wisdom schools, as well as with the fields of transper- sonal psychology, transcendental phenomenology, and the leading edge of quantum physics, cosmology, and consciousness studies. Jiva Gosvāmi&rsquo;s treatise certainly took into account the most impor- tant philosophical views of his day, and there is much in his writ- ing that can be of great value to modern fields of knowledge as well. So the language used in translating his work has been chosen to facilitate such correspondence.
To assist the reader we have supplied below an explanation of key terms that appear throughout the text so that the underly- ing meaning that has informed them can be clearly understood. In this regard, three terms in particular require special attention so that their sense may be correctly understood by the reader: &ldquo;nondual devotion&rdquo; as a translation (in select passages) for uttama- bhakti, the &ldquo;Nondual Personal Absolute&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Complete Whole&rdquo;

In going through this vital introduction to the language of the Sandarbhas, we hope you will discover that this is not merely a glos- sary of terms, but an interconnected framework of revelatory con- cepts. With this in mind, the selection begins with acintya, the transrational, because it contains a discussion of sabdyate, how the Absolute is describable in words.
second
Ion to show its corresp
ACINTYA (TRANSRATIONAL) This term refers to that which is beyond conventional logic or reason, yet not altogether inexpress- ible through language and thought. The Nondual Absolute is not altogether inconceivable because it can be conceived, but only through transrational logic. Śrīdhara Svami as well as Jiva Gosvāmi define it as tarka-asaham - beyond the range of conventional or linear logic. Just as there exist higher order laws operating within the quantum domain that don&rsquo;t conform to mechanistic sci- ence, so also there are higher order dynamics existing within the transpersonal domain that surpass conventional logic. It is these transrational dynamics that make possible transcendent variety and distinction within the nondual whole while still preserving perfectly intact its nondual nature. So although acintya literally means &ldquo;beyond thought,&rdquo; or &ldquo;inconceivable,&rdquo; it actually points to the realm of transconventional being, which is nonetheless describable in words.
The transpersonal reality is, of course, beyond mind and thought and is incapable of being grasped merely by mental striv- ing; yet being of the nature of self-luminosity, or self-revelation, it can nonetheless disclose itself even through thought and language. So acintya, rendered as inconceivable, does not imply incapability of being expressed in words. Bearing this in mind, acintya should not be equated with Sankara&rsquo;s notion of anirvacaniya, or inexpress- ibility through words. If Brahman is no more than unqualified being, devoid of characteristics or potencies, then nothing more can be said about It, because any description would ultimately be an imposition of a thought construct upon inscrutable reality.d
788
The Language of Transcendence - Key Terms and Concepts
SniIf, however, as the Bhāgavata maintains, the Absolute is replete with unlimited potency, then unlimited words, which are them- selves potencies emanating from that source, can appropriately describe that Reality. This is exactly the point that Jiva Gosvāmi makes in Bhagavat Sandarbha (Anuccheda 98). The Vedas are trans- human words emanating from the divine source that accurately depict its true inherent nature, because the Vedas are infused with the self-revelatory power of the intrinsic potency. Jiva goes a step further by saying that even human speech that is similarly infused with the intrinsic potency and thus in correspondence with the divine source can also describe the Absolute. This is the final pur- pose for which the intellect, mind, and senses were created in the first place. In the words of the Bhagavata (10.87.2), these material instruments were created &ldquo;ultimately to transcend the act of filter- ing experience through the screen of prior assumptions (akalpa- naya), or in other words, for liberation.&rdquo; So in answer to the ques- tion, &ldquo;how can thought and language describe the Absolute?&rdquo; it can simply be said, &ldquo;because they were created specifically to do so.&rdquo;
(woled
Hence, the word śabdyate, &ldquo;describable in words,&rdquo; is used in reference to the Nondual Absolute, mentioned in the Bhāgavata&rsquo;s seminal verse (1.2.11). It is for this reason that the knowers of truth (tattva-vit) refer to it as Brahman, Paramātmā, and Bhagavan. It is in this light too that Śrī Jiva defines acintya as śästraika-gamya- tvam - that which is knowable only through the revealed word of God or of realized devotees. He did not conclude it to be ineffable.
BRAHMAN (THE UNQUALIFIED ABSOLUTE) This refers to the Nondual Absolute (advaya-jñāna), devoid of all distinctions, such as names, forms, qualities, and action, and hence devoid of inher- ent potency (svarupa-śakti). Such distinctions (bheda) are per- ceived through conventional logic to be limiting adjuncts (upādhis) that would confine the Absolute, leading to the inevitable dualism of subject and object (i.e., the name is different from the named and potency different from &ldquo;the potent&rdquo;). Thus Brahman is sometimes conceived as that which remains upon negation of the sum total of the phenomenal.ting of u
789
afgaand has any References to gugall
Such conventional logic, of course, presupposes all distinc- tion as &ldquo;phenomenal distinction.&rdquo; It cannot at all account even for the possibility of transphenomenal distinction (acintya bheda) because that is necessarily beyond the predetermined range of its own investigative validity. It cannot make any claims whatsoever in regard to possibilities lying beyond this limit. So, in effect, all that can be definitely concluded by this method is that for the Abso- lute to be nondual, it cannot have material names, material forms, and so on. If there are such things as transphenomenal names, forms, qualities, action, and personhood that are inherently non- dual, or that exist as inherent potencies of the Nondual Absolute, an altogether different method and logic, transrational in nature, is required to apprehend them. Hence, to be precise, Brahman is not so much the Absolute devoid of all distinction as the indistinct vision of the Absolute. In other words, it is the indistinct view of Reality as disclosed by the path of jñana. It is not the distinct view of Reality inclusive of a transphenomenal interiority, as disclosed by the path of nondual devotion (see uttama bhakti and svarupa-śakti below). doy
brow and songH
PARAMATMA (THE SUPREME INDWELLING SELF OR, SIMPLY, THE SUPREME SELF) This refers to the immanent feature of the Absolute, pervading the cosmos and the individual living beings as the Supreme witness, internal guide, and regulator. Paramātmā is the Supreme Self of all individual selves (ātmā), and so He may also be referred to as the Supreme Immanent or the Supreme Immanent Self. Though Paramātmā remains uninvolved with prakṛti and the living beings as impartial witness, He is, nonetheless, their origina- tor and the facilitator of their operations. As such He is Iśvara, the Supreme Controller, Master, Source, and Foundation. Yet, Param- ātmā should not be equated with &ldquo;the Creator God&rdquo; because primor- dial nature and the living beings are His eternal potencies. Hence, Paramātmā is the Nondual Absolute in His feature of immanence.
In contrast with Brahman, Paramātmā is replete with transphe- nomenal distinction, including name, form, qualities, action, and personhood, all of which are inherent in Him. While yet nondifferent from Bhagavan, He is but a portion of a portion of
790

the original Complete Person (Svayam Bhagavan). So while He Himself in His own self-effulgent nature is fully transcendent, His sphere of influence is tied to the perpetual play of creation, known as sṛṣṭi-lila. Thus, He does not manifest the full extension of transcendental variegatedness as in the case of Bhagavan. So Paramātmā is Bhagavan with the limited role of sheltering the modifications of prakṛti and the jivas who are involved with her.

BHAGAVAN (THE NONDUAL PERSONAL ABSOLUTE) logically, the word bhagavan is composed of bhaga + vat, endowed with or encompassing all opulence (bhaga). That which encom- passes everything is the Complete Whole, implying that it includes and yet transcends everything. Bhagavan may also be rendered as the Complete Person (Pūrṇa Purușa) when emphasizing that the Complete Whole is inherently personal in nature. The former term may be more appropriate, or universally applicable, when stress- ing simply Bhagavan&rsquo;s general characteristic of all-inclusivity. In the most generic sense Bhagavan may be referred to simply as the Supreme Person or the Supreme Being.
When speaking of the Absolute as nondual awareness (advaya- jñāna) and Bhagavan as the complete distinct vision of nondual awareness, it may be appropriate to refer to Bhagavan as the Non- dual Personal Absolute in keeping with the context. In contrast with Brahman, Bhagavan is the distinct vision of the Nondual Absolute, inherently self-endowed with intrinsic potency (svarupa- śakti), and hence eternally replete with transcendental name, form, qualities, action, and personhood. As discussed above, though all of these distinct characteristics inhere in Him, He is yet one and nondual in nature, which is made possible through His unprece- dented transrational power (acintya-śakti). So the metaphysical system that depicts this state of being is known as acintya-bheda- abheda. In contrast with Paramātmā, who is but a portion of the Complete Whole, Bhagavan&rsquo;s variegatedness is entirely beyond the realm of creation, being exclusively the play of divinity, known as divya-līlā. Hence, Bhagavan may be understood as the Nondual Absolute in His feature of supreme transcendence.

BH The Nondual Personal Absolute, Bhagavan, is not just the Com- plete Whole, but an integrated whole. He is not whole because of being devoid of distinct parts that might otherwise contradict His undifferentiated unity. Rather, He is inherently inclusive of varieties of distinct energies as their supreme source and refuge. These energies have no existence apart from Bhagavan and thus in this sense are nondifferent from Him. Yet, while these energies exist as distinct aspects of His inherent nature, He is more than the sum total of them. He thus includes and yet transcends them. He is therefore an integrated whole having individual parts that are dis- tinct from, and yet one with, Him. There is nothing which exists independent of Bhagavan.
THE JIVA (THE INDIVIDUAL LIVING BEING) This refers to the conscious self (ātmā) as qualified by the intellect (buddhi), ego (ahankara), the mind (manas), the senses, and the physical body. In this sense, the jiva is known as the embodied self or the empiri- cal self. Yet, the jiva&rsquo;s individual selfhood (i.e., its supra-empirical selfhood rooted in the very identity of the ātmā) is not a product of mere illusion that vanishes on the awakening of its identity with Brahman. Though the jiva is one in identity with Brahman, this does not signify absolute nondistinction as advocated by Sankara. The jiva is in fact a conscious part of Paramātmā. By this it is not meant that the jiva is a broken-off part but an integrated part of the Complete Whole.
The jiva eternally partakes of identity with Paramātmā and can never be ontologically separated from Paramātmā, even in the so- called state of bondage. The jiva, as conscious or integrated part (cid-amsa), is never truly bound. The jiva, however, is sometimes referred to as vibhinnäṁśa, a separated part. This separation is purely psychological, owing to beginningless ignorance. Even in this state of psychological or self-imposed bondage, the jiva is no other than an integrated part of the integrated whole. This is due to the fact that the jiva is an eternal distinct potency of Param- ātmā known as taṭastha-sakti, the intermediary potency. It is so- called because it belongs neither to the intrinsic spiritual potency (svarupa-śakti) nor to the extrinsic material potency (māyā-śakti),
792

but can be influenced by both. So the jiva is eternally distinct from and yet one with Paramātmā, by virtue of the transrational potency (acintya-sakti) of the one Nondual Absolute.who
QUTTAMA BHAKTI (PURE OR UNALLOYED DEVOTION) First of all, because the entire discussion of Bhagavata Sandarbha proceeds on the basis of the definition of Ultimate Reality as nondual consciousness (advaya-jñāna), and because Bhagavan is shown to be nondual consciousness in its highest completion, it seems only appropriate to consider bhakti, which is the means of realiz- ing the Nondual Personal Whole, Bhagavan, as being of the nature of nonduality. In light of this consideration, nondual devotion does not refer to devotion merely as a means of realizing the unquali- fied Nondual Absolute (i.e., Brahman). Such a notion would be more appropriately rendered as devotional nonduality, wherein nonduality is the subject and devotion merely a qualifier. Rather, nondual devotion is meant in the sense of the inherent potency of the complete Nondual Absolute, Bhagavan, which reveals Him as the unity that upholds all distinction. It is the devotion opened to when all separative and dualistic self-concepts operating under the influence of the gunas have been transcended. The purity of uttama bhakti signifies that it is altogether beyond the influence of the gunas of primordial nature, and thus it is also known as nirguna bhakti (see the discussion that follows below).
DEVOTION MIXED WITH THE GUNAS (DUALISTIC DEVOTION) Correspondingly, if nondual devotion is the means that discloses the Nondual Absolute as Bhagavan, then devotion mixed with the gunas must necessarily be dualistic in nature. This is exactly what Kapiladeva states in the Bhagavata (3.29.8-10). He uses the terms bhinna-drg-bhava (of separatist vision) and pṛthak-bhāva (a sepa- ratist) to describe the performers of devotion mixed with any one of the three gunas. In Bhakti Sandarbha, after the description of äropa-siddha bhakti (attributive devotion) and sanga-siddha bhakti (associative devotion), there follows the explanation of uttama bhakti (i.e., svarupa-siddha bhakti). But the delineation of uttama bhakti proper is preceded by a discussion of bhakti in the gunas, which is marked by these three types of separatist or dualistic
793simone hamist yo References

visions. The key point is that the performer is still rooted in dual- ism, considering him or herself separate from Bhagavan. Sadhana is thus performed with this dualistic mentality, as a means only to an end and therefore causal in nature, rather than as an end unto itself, acausal in nature, as immediate and present connection with Bhagavan, here and now.
NIRGUNA BHAKTI (DEVOTION FREE FROM THE GUNAS) BY contrast with mixed devotion, devotion free from the gunas is com- pared (SB 3.29.11) to the natural, continuous, unobstructed flow of the Ganga to the sea, because the Ganga, while distinct from the ocean, is nonetheless in no way disconnected from the ocean, which is its final refuge. Jiva Gosvāmī states in Tattva Sandarbha that the oneness of the jiva and Brahman is in terms of identity of being, yet he clarifies that this oneness in no way implies abso- lute nondistinction. It could also be stated the other way, that the distinction between the jiva and Paramātmā in no way implies absolute or categorical separation. In fact, as an integrated part of the Complete Whole, the jiva can never be separated from Param- ātmā, even in the state of bondage. The sense of separation is merely psychological, having no ontological reality whatsoever. Hence, devotion in which the performer holds to the egoistic posi- tion of being a doer or subject separate from the ultimate &ldquo;object&rdquo; (Bhagavan) is most appropriately referred to as dualistic devotion.
By placing this discussion as a preface to uttama bhakti, Jīva Gosvāmi clearly recognizes this mentality as a significant and prominent pitfall among those who presume themselves to be on the path of pure devotion. So the terms nondual devotion and dualistic devotion are helpful in clarifying this most important dis- tinction. And what does this distinction imply in practical terms for the practitioner? It is not we who perform devotion, rather it is devotion that performs us. That is to say that devotion enacts itself through its own power of self-revelation, and in so doing it reveals the living being in its true identity, lending its inherent nature of awareness and bliss to the instrument of its manifestation.
Beginning from the sense organs, the tongue, ears, eyes, hands, and so on, it works its ways inward, pervading the internal organs,

The Language of Transcendence - Key Terms and Concepts
the vital system, the emotions and the mental quantum of mind, ego, and intellect, till it reaches at last to the ātmā, making the ātmā one with its essential nature. In what sense then can the practi- tioner truly be said to be a practitioner or a performer of devotion? One who holds to the egoistic and separatist conception of being a performer of devotion, a chanter of the name, a doer of acts of good to others and God, and so on, is caught in dualistic devotion, impeding this transcendental flow. When we abandon this sepa- ratist identity, we become but instruments through which devo- tion itself flows unimpeded, the interactive screen upon which the divine name arises, the playground in which the drama of worship unfolds.
916
KARMA (DUALISTIC ACTION) In the same light, karma, even in its niskāma form in which the desire for the fruit of action is relin- quished, is necessarily dualistic because the performer holds to the notion of being separate from the object and the result of action. It is for this reason that Jiva Gosvāmī as well as Sanatana Gosvāmī dis- agree with Śrīdhara Svami in not accepting karma offered to Bhaga- vän as bhakti. Even when the desire for fruit is given up, the sense of doership remains. So, when the discussion again carries refer- ence to the Absolute as nondual awareness, karma is appropriately referred to as dualistic action. In a more general context, it may be rendered as goal-oriented or result-oriented action. This is just another way of saying the same thing because all dualistic action is carried out by a performer seeking some particular result that is separated both from the performer and the act itself in time and place and is therefore causal in nature.
SANKARA&rsquo;S ADVAITA VEDANTA (RADICAL NONDUALISM) This is but one school of Vedanta and hence but one school of nondu- alism. From the Bhāgavata (1.2.11) and from Jiva Gosvāmi&rsquo;s analysis throughout the Sat Sandarbha, it is clear that there is also theistic or devotional nondualism. In fact, Jiva Gosvāmi&rsquo;s entire vision devel- ops from his understanding of the Absolute as nondual awareness, and from his recognition of nonduality as the common ground and the lowest common denominator from which a discussion of the Absolute can proceed. Thus, the Bhagavata&rsquo;s vision of nonduality,
795
atque fins a References togel s
which Jiva seeks to bring forth, is a unique one, far exceeding the generic oneness of Sankara.emi biroga
So it is essential to speak of different schools of nonduality with different emphasis. It is in this light that we refer to Sankara&rsquo;s view as Radical Nondualism, from the Latin radix, or &ldquo;connected to the root,&rdquo; implying that his view denies all distinction to the very core. It is absolute in its denial of distinction.
Sankara&rsquo;s doctrine claims to represent the quintessence of the Upanisads. Yet, in the Upanisads we find two types of state- ments, i.e., those that accommodate transphenomenal variety within unity and those that emphasize oneness and nondistinc- tion. Examples of the first type are svābhāviki jñāna bala kriyā ca, &ldquo;The Supreme Person has multifarious potencies that are intrinsic to His being, including knowledge, will power, and action&rdquo; (Śvetā- svatara Upanisad 6.8), and, nityo nityānāṁ cetanas cetanānām eko, &ldquo;There is one supreme eternal amongst all the eternal living beings and one supreme conscious source amongst the multitude of con- scious entities&rdquo; (Katha Upanisad 2.2.13). Examples of the second type are sarvam khalv idam brahma, &ldquo;All this is indeed Brahman&rdquo; (Chandogya Upanisad 3.14.1), and, neha nänä &lsquo;sti kiñcana, &ldquo;There is no diversity here whatsoever&rdquo; (Katha Upanisad 2.1.11). Sankara has given importance only to those statements that emphasize one- ness alone and treated the statements advocating unity in variety as secondary, denying primary meaning to them without giving any satisfactory explanation or reason.

The question may be asked, how can nondualism be put forth as the most valid description of reality when it is practically observed that there is a distinction between subject and object, between Spirit (Brahman) and the world (jagat or prakṛti), between con- scious beings (jivas) and insentient matter? Sankara&rsquo;s solution is to advocate nondualism (lit. &ldquo;not two&rdquo;) by denial of the object: brahma satyam jagan mithya (the world is unreal, only Brahman is real), so that in effect there is only Brahman, there is only the subject and no object, there is only one. So, because Sankara&rsquo;s nondualism denies the object to the very root (radix), it may be referred to as Radical Nondualism. That is to say that it can
796
The Language of Transcendence - Key Terms and Concepts
account for oneness only (abheda) and not for distinction. Distinc- tion is admitted only in an empirical sense (as mithya) but with- out fundamental ontological existence. He can in no way accom- modate transphenomenal distinction (acintya-bheda), because he cannot accommodate inherent potency (svarupa-śakti) within the Nondual Whole.
An alternate meaning of radical is &ldquo;that which is a departure from tradition.&rdquo; Sankara&rsquo;s Vedanta or Nondualism is radical in this sense too because it is a departure from the traditional or mainstream Vedantic view that acknowledges the ontological real- ity of prakṛti, Iśvara, and the living being. Sankara may have thought it necessary to reinterpret this view in order to legitimize and stress the nondual nature of the Absolute, but in doing so, he introduced a strategic error that ultimately undermined his own system, that of Brahman&rsquo;s becoming overwhelmed by māyā. It is for this reason that his doctrine is sometimes rightly referred to as Māyāvāda, because maya, which is said by him to be devoid of onto- logical reality, is yet able to overcome Brahman, the one and only real. Because of this mutation of mainstream Vedantic thought, his system may appropriately be referred to as &ldquo;Radical Nondualism.&rdquo;
Again, Sankara&rsquo;s attempt to establish nonduality by denial of the object proves to be inadequate and unsatisfactory. His contri- bution is significant in what it attempts to accomplish, but it begs a more comprehensive and far-reaching understanding of nondu- ality. In a way, Sankara&rsquo;s view can be seen as a reaction to, and the counterpart of, the Buddhist doctrine of anatta (or anātma), which by contrast establishes nonduality by denial of the subject. Both of these views, though establishing nondualism from opposite starting points, stop short of a truly authentic transrational meta- physics, resorting to conventional logic to establish a limited and hence morphed nonduality. Still, both are useful in urging con- ventional devotion out of its tendency to get stuck in dualism. It is finally the acintya-bheda-abheda metaphysics of the Bhāgavata and Jiva Gosvāmi that completes and surpasses the limited nondualistic views of Śankara and the Buddha.

NONDUALITY OF THE BHAGAVATA (THEISTIC NONDUALISM) By comparison, the nonduality of the Bhagavata may be referred to as theistic nondualism, which finds its most complete expression in the visionary view known as acintya-bheda-abheda, the transra- tional inherence of distinction within the integral Nondual Whole. In this view, like that of Sankara, there is only one vastava vastu, or ontological existent that is nondual in nature, yet unlike Sankara, it is admitted that unlimited potency of different categories inheres in this one existent. Though the inherence of distinction appar- ently contradicts its nonduality from the point of view of conven- tional reason or logic, from the transrational perspective (acintya), it is perfectly in keeping with the higher internal laws (or consti- tuting nature) that govern the transphenomenal reality. To take it a step further, nondualism that can accommodate oneness only and not distinction remains impoverished and hence can hardly be admitted as the Complete Whole.ded arender to fent me
Therefore, theistic nondualism extends far beyond Sankara&rsquo;s view. Yet, if Bhagavan is wrongly interpreted merely as the creator or regulator God, then this would seem to advocate dualism. This is a gross error that has allowed nondual devotion to be reduced to dualistic worship. Theism in general is almost automatically equated with dualism and is thus conceived to be inferior by the schools of nondualism that advocate either Brahman or nirvāṇa as ultimate. The highest state of the transpersonal is concluded through conventional logic to be non-personal. But this is exactly the point at which conventional logic breaks down. The logic that exhausts itself at the doorway of Brahman or nirvana becomes the barrier to the hidden interior of nondual awareness, an expanded nonduality that accommodates distinction in oneness.
This is why it is imperative to begin the discussion of reality at the point of advaya-jñāna and to correspondingly understand Bha- gavan as the Nondual Personal Absolute. In this way, we eliminate the possibility of the misplaced reduction and force the investiga- tion of reality to proceed beyond its general limit, that of unqual- ified, indistinct, monolithic Brahman. That is the real purpose of the Bhāgavata and Jiva Gosvāmi&rsquo;s presentation of the Bhagavata

Sandarbha - to lead the discussion into the interiority of nondual awareness.tommi ylsma galed Iatashasane lo andiansmib 915 SVARUPA-SAKTI (THE INTERIORITY OF NONDUAL AWARE- NESS) This refers to the inherent potency with which the Nondual Absolute is eternally self-endowed. When the Nondual Absolute is conceived as unqualified and devoid of potency, It is known as Brahman. When the same Nondual Absolute is con- ceived as inherently self-endowed with all potency, It is known as Bhagavan. The ontological entity is one and the same, yet, a higher order, or, in other words, transrational, logic is required to under- stand how distinction (bheda) can be possible without violating the basic nature of nonduality (abheda). This is worked out in detail in the Bhāgavata and the Sat Sandarbha. In short, the inherent nature of the Nondual Absolute cannot be other than nondual. And it is the inherent nature or intrinsic potency of the Nondual Absolute that discloses its interiority, that discloses its variegated display of transcendent being, awareness, and bliss. So it is the intrin- sic potency (svarupa-śakti), particularly in the form of nondual devotion (uttama bhakti), that discloses the interiority of nondual awareness.toveh apoiaigaus lley

EKAPADA &amp; TRIPADA VIBHŪTI (ONEFOLD AND THREEFOLD DIMENSIONALITY OF BEING) These terms are commonly ren- dered as &ldquo;the one-quarter manifestation of Reality&rdquo; (i.e., the mate- rial realm) and &ldquo;the three-quarter manifestation of Reality&rdquo; (i.e., the spiritual realm). Strictly speaking, however, this has nothing to do with any sort of mathematical ratio between the material and spiritual domains. If the spiritual realm is infinite, should it not be infinitely more vast than the material world? (In fact, even the material realm is infinite, and conventional mathematics fails at the level of infinity, infinity being transrational.) Moreover, if the 3:1 ratio is merely symbolic to indicate the magnitude of Spirit in relation to matter, why then express it by such a paltry ratio as 3:1 instead of, say, a million to one? After all, we are speaking about infinity and 3:1 just doesn&rsquo;t seem to cut it.
As Jiva Gosvāmi demonstrates in Bhagavat Sandarbha (Anucche- da 78), 3:1 refers to something quite specific. Tripād vibhūti, which
799
que y References to saugnal st
by
is another name for the spiritual realm, refers to three qualities or dimensions of transcendental being, namely immortality (amṛta- tva), fearlessness (abhaya), and auspiciousness (kṣema). These are three qualities woven into the fabric of transcendence. Ekapāda vibhuti, on the other hand, which is a name for the material world, refers to mortality alone. Thus, in the material world, &ldquo;being&rdquo; cul- minates moment to moment in death alone. Fear and inauspicious- ness, which are the material counterparts of the other two spiritual characteristics, are subsumed within the simple inescapable fact of mortality. So it is clear from this analysis that we are speaking about dimensions or aspects of being and not about mathematical ratios. Vow
Further, a parallel can be drawn between the three qualitative dimensions of transcendental being and the well-known descrip- tion of Spirit as sat-cit-ananda. Immortality can be equated with sat, because it signifies eternal existence. Fearlessness can be equated with cit, because it is a state of awareness, and auspicious- ness can be equated with ananda, because it is a state of beatitude and, hence, bliss. Jiva Gosvāmi goes on to explain that kṣema, or aus- piciousness, specifically refers to all-auspicious devotion, which culminates in prema (i.e., ānanda).

Gosvāmi says that jñāna and bhakti are the two direct methods to se shift awareness toward the Absolute. Other methods, such as karma,
Sankhya, and vairagya, may act as assistants to these two primary noit methods. In conclusion, however, bhakti is the sole method that engenders an embrace of the Whole in completion.word ni

SANKHYA One of the six traditional systems of Indian philosophy; the Inline path of knowledge involving an analysis of Spirit and matter. The
founder of the Classical Sankhya-yoga system is the sage Kapila, He who is different from the avatara of Bhagavan known as Kapila, ad mi the son of Kardama and Devahūti. Classical Sankhya is atheistic in Fits nature, being devoid of the concept of Iśvara. In this system the cos-
mos unfolds as the interplay of purusa, the self, and prakṛti, primor- dial nature. When prakṛti, which is the state of equilibrium of the ouho three gunas, is brought into the proximity of the purusas, it sets in Cabe motion a chain of cause and effect that evolves the cosmos. In course took of time, the cosmos is reabsorbed into its primordial state. All of this
takes place to facilitate the purusas in the pursuit of both enjoyment sill grand eventual liberation. In the Bhagavatam conception of Sankhya, however, the original Puruşa is Mahāviṣṇu, who activates prakṛti adulthrough His glance.

IN GITA 15.7, Kṛṣṇa says that the jiva is a part of Him alone (mama eva amśaḥ). Kṛṣṇa is Svayam Bhagavan, God in His own original form and essence, the fountainhead of all avataras. Then why does Jiva Gosvāmī say that the jiva is part of Paramātmā and not of Kṛṣṇa? In fact, however, there is no contradiction in the two statements. The jiva is a part of Paramātmā, and Paramātmā is an expansion of Kṛṣṇa&hellip;
Jiva Gosvāmi makes it clear that the jiva is not a part in the literal sense, like a drop of water is to the ocean. In other words, it is not a part whose removal would reduce or alter the Whole in some way. It is a part simply because it belongs to one of the potencies of Paramātmā. Moreover, because the jiva is a conscious being, it cannot be part of the extrinsic energy, but because it comes under the influence of maya, or ignorance, it does not belong to the intrinsic potency. Therefore, it belongs to the intermediate category, or tatastha energy. From the commentary on Anuccheda 39
