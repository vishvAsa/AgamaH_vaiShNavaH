We bow down to Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmi Prabhupada who revealed the essential meaning of Srimad Bhagavatam to the people of the world just as plainly as one would display an amalaki fruit kept on one's palm.

One who has not undergone comprehensive study of Sat Sandarbhas must struggle to assimilate the message of Srimad Bhagavatam. One who has studied Sat Sandarbhas, however, will have no misgivings about the essential meaning of Srimad Bhāgavatam.

Śrī Bhagavan said: "I shall teach you, who are devoid of envy, this most secret knowledge [of devotion] along with the means of its realization, knowing which, you will become free from the inauspiciousness of conditional existence." (GITĀ 9.1)

THE REAL GOAL OF LIFE IS HAPPINESS. In whatever we do, our ulti- mate goal is to be happy. Happiness can be attained in two ways: by pleasing our own senses or by pleasing the Supreme Person (Bha- gavan), directly or indirectly. Those who seek their own happiness independent of Bhagavan ultimately remain unhappy. The reason is that we cannot truly please ourselves while we are confused about who we actually are. 
A human being is a conscious self, animating a physical body, ego, mind and discriminating intellect. As such, the conscious self is our true identity, whereas the other four instruments are acquired, temporary and superficial dimensions of embodied life. Because we mistake the body, ego, mind and intellect to be the most important dimensions of our being, we fail to achieve happiness and try in vain to please our senses. When one recognizes oneself as a conscious being, as a part of Bhagavan distinct from the body-mind-complex, one will understand how to attain true happiness. Vedic literature teaches that the basic cause of suffering is ignorance about our real 
XVIntroduction 
self. The Vedic seers thus provided authentic knowledge to enable humanity to overcome this ignorance. They considered this effort to be the highest welfare for society. Keeping the ultimate goal of enlightenment in mind, they devised four pursuits (puruṣārthas) for human life. They did not teach us to neglect our physical needs, but to satisfy them in a way that we remain aligned with the ultimate goal, which is to realize our real identity. Vedic society thus con- ceived of four human pursuits corresponding to the four aspects of a human being. The basic need of an individual is survival, which is directly related to the physical body. This primarily entails food, clothing and shelter. To acquire these necessities, there is a need for wealth (artha), because not everyone can produce all the require- ments for their own survival. Consequently, there arises the need to exchange commodities or for a means of commerce. 
Once the basic means for survival have been provided for, there is a natural tendency to seek pleasure or happiness (kama), which is related to the mind. Wealth is also needed to fulfill a person's desires for happiness. To procure wealth and mental pleasure, there is a need for social organization. This necessitates striving not only for one's own economic welfare and sense pleasure but doing it in such a way that one does not impede the goals of other members of society. Therefore, some order and discipline is required to maintain balance in society, and this integral system of morals is termed dharma. V 
The previous three objectives follow a single line of evolution, but the fourth goal arises to correct the ineffectiveness of all the previ- ous goals. No matter how well defined and refined our ethics, how equitable and stable our financial base, and how opulent our stan- dard of living, still we remain unfulfilled. Our reaction to this persis- tent dissatisfaction is to seek mokṣa - "freedom." This begins with the simple desire to be disentangled from money and social restric- tions, and culminates in the aspiration to be freed from all limita- tions imposed by finite existence within a relativistic universe. All four goals, however, are related only to the body, ego, mind and intel- lect, which together form the external covering of the self. Although the fourth goal extricates the self from the mire of the body-mind- complex, it does not deliver any positive happiness to the self.

Introduction 
bal Perceiving that sense gratification provides but limited and self- ish satisfaction, people propose that seeing to the wants and needs of others, rather than our own, will bring true happiness. Cer- tainly this comes closer to the mark, yet a feeling of emptiness per- sists within, because such acts of welfare are not aimed at the ulti- mate goal. Rather than catering to one's own misidentification with the body-mind-complex, they cater to that same misidentification within others.vikute ardaligidan 
Why is this so? Because such acts do not take the root of the prob- lem into consideration. True altruism lies not in merely taking care of the external persona of a living being; it lies in alleviating the ignorance that is the root of everyone's disability in finding happi- ness - ignorance of one's true identity in relation to Bhagavan. To enlighten the ignorant and conditioned self to its true identity solves the eternal problem of happiness at its very root. Śrī Kṛṣṇa says in Bhagavad Gita that one of the basic godly characteristics is to be compassionate towards others, and that this compassion releases us from our beginningless suffering? The core mission of the Vedas is to provide knowledge about the self and its relation to the Supreme Self, enabling true altruism and compassion. 
The great seers of India illustrated this transcendental altruism by striving tirelessly to enlighten the masses. Among such luminar- ies, Śrī Jīva Gosvāmi is a brilliant moon who performed unparalleled welfare to humanity by presenting the essence of Vedic literature in the form of the Sat Sandarbhas. Without the detailed guidance of a work like the Sat Sandarbhas, a seeker of knowledge can easily get lost in the dense forest of Vedic literature, not knowing where to begin and how to pursue his spiritual life. to gbolwork bilav

Introduction 
easiest and best way to know our relation to Bhagavan is revealed in Srimad Bhagavatam, the final work of Śrī Vedavyāsa. He consid- ered the study of Srimad Bhagavatam an integral process of realizing that relationship and thus finally attaining the ultimate goal of life: unadulterated joy. To grant humanity a thorough, systematic under- standing of Srimad Bhagavata Purana, Śrī Jiva Gosvāmi wrote Bhāga- vata Sandarbha, "A Compilation of the Bhagavata" (also known as Ṣat Sandarbha, "Six Compilations," because it has six divisions: Tattva, Bhagavat, Paramātma, Kṛṣṇa, Bhakti, and Priti Sandarbha). 
Overview of the Six Sandarbhas 
Sat Sandarbha is a systematically organized compilation of essential verses from Srimad Bhagavatam, thoroughly revealing its essential message. According to Jīva Gosvāmi, Śrīmad Bhagavatam describes three basic subjects: (1) our identity in relation to the Absolute (sambandha-jñāna), (2) the process to realize that identity (abhid- heya-tattva), and (3) the ultimate goal achieved by doing so (prayo- jana-tattva). In the Sat Sandarbhas, Sri Jiva elaborates on these three topics. 
Tattva Sandarbha is the first of the Six Sandarbhas and is an intro- duction to the rest. It can be divided into two parts: pramāņa and prameya. The first part (pramāna) deals with epistemology, the means of acquiring valid knowledge. In this part, Jīva Gosvāmī establishes Śrīmad Bhagavatam as the foremost source of valid tran- scendental knowledge. It is very important to note Śrī Jiva Gosvāmi's conviction that Srimad Bhagavatam is not merely a book containing valid knowledge of Reality; it actually qualifies the reader to directly perceive Reality and is itself nondifferent from Reality. This convic- tion is indeed shared by Śrī Vyasa himself and proclaimed decisively at the very beginning of Srimad Bhagavatam (1.1.2 and 1.3.44). 
The second part (prameya) begins to focus on the actual meaning of Bhāgavatam, revealing its essence in summary by examining the vision of Reality that was disclosed to Vyasadeva while in the state of trance. In short, Jīva Gosvāmī establishes that the ultimate subject of knowledge is Bhagavan in relation to His variegated energies. 
xviii 
Introduction 
In the next three Sandarbhas (beginning with this one, Bhaga- vat Sandarbha), Jiva Gosvāmi elaborates on the topic of ontology (sambandha-jñāna). He begins this volume by establishing Reality as the nondual absolute substantive, existing most completely as Bhagavan, the transcendent Supreme Person. 
In the third volume (Paramätma Sandarbha), he delineates Bha- gavan's manifestation immanent within all entities, called Param- ātmā, Iśvara or Purușa. He also describes the ontology of the indi- vidual living beings (jivas) and the illusory potency (māyā). The jiva is a conscious integrated part of Paramātmā, and the illusory energy that enthralls and conditions the jiva is Paramātmā's exter- nal energy.gilson lliw loubivibuildieiviai 
The fourth volume (Krsna Sandarbha) reveals Śrī Kṛṣṇa as Svayam Bhagavan, the original Supreme Person. It also describes how Śrī Kṛṣṇa has His eternal abode manifest in three places, namely, Vṛndāvana, Mathura and Dvārakā. He is timelessly present in these three places along with His ever-liberated associates, engaged in His eternal divine līlā. 
The fifth volume (Bhakti Sandarbha) elaborates upon the method- ology of self-realization (abhidheya). Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī explains that devotional service performed for the pleasure of Śrī Kṛṣṇa (bhakti) without any tinge of vested interest is the method to realize one's relationship to Absolute Reality, which naturally entails real- ization of one's true identity. Without bhakti, no other process, such as jñāna-yoga, is efficacious in realizing the Absolute. He describes the various types and practices of bhakti and concludes that the highest form of bhakti is performed following the intrinsic mood and nature of the eternal associates in Vraja. 
bulm 
Bhakti leads one to the ultimate goal, prayojana, which is the sub- ject matter of the sixth and final volume, Priti Sandarbha. Here Śrī Jiva Gosvāmī provides a detailed analysis of priti, love for Kṛṣṇa. He shows that priti is not just a sentiment (bhava), but an aesthetic relish of that sentiment (rasa). Priti brings about the union of the devo- tee and Kṛṣṇa without any loss of ontological individuality. This union or oneness is indeed the secret meaning of the non-dualistic statements of the Upanisads, such as tat tvam asi - You are that.

Introduction 
Summary of Bhagavat Sandarbha dan orts al 
The central theme of Jiva Gosvāmi's discussion in Bhagavat San- darbha is based upon the second line of the famous verse from Bhā- gavata Purana (1.2.11): "Knowers of the Absolute describe it as non- dual consciousness, naming it as Brahman, as Paramātmā and as Bhagavan."sus did dashni nodinama nivag 
Jiva Gosvāmi's purpose in writing this Sandarbha is to establish Bhagavan, consisting of a trans-empirical form replete with tran- scendental energies, as the highest manifestation of the Absolute, superior even to Brahman. Although Absolute Reality is one and indivisible, an individual will realize it in three stages of completion, as far as his or her individual capacity of realization permits. Thus, individuals can realize Absolute Reality as Brahman, Paramātmā or Bhagavan. The specific sequence of nouns used in this verse ("Brah- man, Paramātmā and Bhagavan") indicates the increasing impor- tance and completeness of each succeeding manifestation. Śrī Jīva Gosvāmī also points out that Absolute Reality is never authentically realized as the jiva, the individual living being. malog din sdr 
When one realizes the Absolute Truth without perceiving any distinction between its energies and the Absolute itself as Energetic Source, it is called Brahman. When through deeper intuitive insight one apprehends a distinction between the energies and the Ener- getic Source, but perceives this distinction only in relation to phe- nomenal energies (the world and the living entities within it), the Reality thus realized is called Paramātmā. When one's discernment of the distinction between energy and Energetic Source moves still deeper to include the internal, transcendental energies of Reality, one begins to perceive Reality as Bhagavan.balada 
Thus, it is clear that there is no ontological difference between Brahman, Paramātmā and Bhagavan. The difference lies only in the level of perception of the respective seekers. Nevertheless, the difference is not just one of nomenclature. () from dedi la aid For example, the phrase "blue lotus" has three components: (1) "lotus" - the noun itself, a substance unqualified by any adjective, ( 2 ) “blue” — the adjective qualifying the noun, and (3) the complete

Introduction 
phrase, "blue lotus" - a qualified substance. There is no real differ- ence between "lotus" and "blue lotus" except that the former does not convey any specific features, whereas the latter clearly states its color. The distinction between Brahman and Bhagavan is similar. 
In this way, even though He is qualified with all potencies, Bha- gavan is the undifferentiated Reality because He is the complete manifestation of the Absolute Truth. Brahman, on the other hand, exhibits no specific qualities and is therefore an incomplete mani- festation of that same Truth, just as "lotus" conveys an incomplete depiction of "blue lotus." As such, even though there is no real dif- ference between Brahman and Bhagavan, they are not one and the same in all respects. The difference lies in the limitation of vision on the part of the seeker.slovni dobro2 aid to resear 
Śrī Jiva explains that when the Absolute is perceived as unquali- fied (i.e., as Brahman), it amounts to bare awareness of the substan- tive prior to the specification of its intrinsic nature. At this stage it is known as viśeşya, or that which is yet to be defined. The energies that inhere in the Absolute are its qualifiers (viseṣana). When the same Absolute is perceived as inclusive of its intrinsic power (i.e., as Bhagavan), it amounts to complete awareness of the substantive as a qualified entity (visista). alidevisongard niti moti sosda bro 
If one realizes Bhagavan, one will naturally understand Brah- man, just as one who beholds a blue lotus automatically sees a lotus. This is why Śrī Jiva did not dedicate a separate Sandarbha to Brah- man. Whatever is essential to know about Brahman is contained within Bhagavat Sandarbha 
asbristo 
As there is no absolute difference between Bhagavan and Brah- man, so too there is no absolute difference between Bhagavan and Paramātmā, the latter being a partial manifestation (sväṁśa) of Bha- gavan. In the Paramātmā manifestation, the Absolute is understood 
*Thus, Śrī Jiva's understanding of Brahman is notably distinct from the Advaita definition, which considers Brahman ultimately to be entirely devoid of all energies, manifest as qualities, forms, names and actions. Śrī Jiva Gosvāmi exerts considerable effort to establish that the energies of Bhagavan are real, eternal, and not superimposed or borrowed, countermanding the philosophy of Advaitavada, which claims that they are superimpositions of maya (Pañcadasi 1.236).

as the source of creation who enters the individual ātmās constitut- ing His "intermediary energy" (taṭastha-śakti), catalyzes the evolu- tion of material elements and various forms from pradhāna, and acts as the inner regulator and facilitator of the interface between the ātmā and the material elements. 
Although there is no absolute difference among the three aspects of the One Absolute Reality, Śrī Jiva Gosvāmi's evaluation is that Bha- gavan is the most complete manifestation (pūrṇa-ävirbhāva), replete with unparalleled variegated potencies. In comparison to Bhagavan, Brahman and Paramätmä are incomplete manifestations (asamyag- āvirbhāva) of the One Absolute Reality. The realization of Bhagavan naturally includes that of Brahman, but not vice versa. 
The rest of this Sandarbha involves a further elaboration on the nature of Bhagavan, revealing the transcendental character of His form, name, abode, devotees, activities and His superiority over Brahman. Hence, Jiva Gosvāmī rightly calls it Bhagavat Sandarbha - an essay on Bhagavan.do y ot 
Referencing the statements of sage Parāśara in Visnu Purāņa (6.5.74), Jīva Gosvāmī shows that the word bhagavan means one who has six-fold majesties in infinite fullness: the power to regulate all existence from within, inconceivable potency, fame, wealth, knowl- edge and detachment. The word bhagavan also means one who is never influenced by the three gunas of prakṛti (VP 6.5.79). His ener- gies have a relationship of inherence (samavaya) with Him. They are inherent within His being, and thus He is never devoid of such potencies. 
Although Bhagavan is endowed with infinite potencies, these potencies are categorized in three groups: internal (antaranga or svarupa-śakti), intermediary (taṭastha or jīva-śakti) and exter- nal (bahiranga or maya-śakti). The internal potency (constituting the true self of Bhagavan) is fully and directly displayed in Him. The other two potencies are displayed indirectly through Param- ātmā. By virtue of His inscrutable, inherent potency, the singular Ultimate Reality eternally manifests in four forms: (1) His own essential form (svarupa), (2) His partial self-expansions (vaibhava), (3) conscious entities with distinct individuality (jiva / ātmā), and 
xxii 
Introduction 
(4) the potentiality inhering in the material elements (pradhana). Thus, Bhagavan is simultaneously endowed with conscious energy (cit-śakti) and inert matter (acit-sakti, also called māyā-śakti or bahiranga-sakti).b of bits 
Māyā-śakti, or the external energy, can never exercise its influ- ence on Bhagavan. However, it has the power of causing delusion to the individual ātmās. The cit-sakti and māyā-śakti are mutu- ally antagonistic (one reveals, whereas the other deludes), and yet their manifold functions are founded in the common substratum of Bhagavan. Insvegara lo mol 
Śrī Jīva Gosvāmī stresses that Bhagavan's energies have two important features: they are trans-rational (acintyatva) and intrin- sic to Him (svābhāvikatva). Since they are trans-rational, the ener- gies of Reality are ultimately inscrutable and not fully within the grasp of human thought and reason (tarka-asaha). "Trans-rational" also indicates that these energies can accomplish logically impossi- ble feats. Another import of "trans-rational" is that the relationship between these energies and their energetic source is not entirely within the grasp of logic. These energies are not distinct from the Energetic, but also not entirely identical to Him. It is by virtue of this understanding that the philosophy of Śrī Caitanya has become known as Acintya-bhedabheda-vāda (the school of trans-rational simultaneous oneness and distinction). That Bhagavan's energies are "intrinsic" indicates that they are natural to Him and constitute in their totality His very essence, although He remains transcen- dent to their totality, as their source. These energies are neither borrowed nor superimposed on Him from any other source. 
In the final section of Bhagavat Sandarbha, Śrī Jīva Gosvāmi explains that these energies have distinct personalities, names and forms. This is why in almost all Indian temples dedicated to Bhaga- vān as Krsna or Visņu, Bhagavan is accompanied by His consort, Śrī Radha or Śrī Laksmi, the personification of His internal potency. of 
The internal energy of Bhagavan also has three aspects: exis- tence (sandhini), awareness (samvit) and bliss (hlädini). The sandhini potency is the intrinsic power of existence of the Self-existent Bhaga- vän, and it upholds the existence of the individual ātmās and nature. 
xxiii 
Introduction 
The samvit potency is the power of knowledge of Bhagavan by which He is all-knowing and which enables all others to know. The hlad- ini potency is the power of bliss, which bestows bliss both to Bha- gavan - who is inherently full of bliss - and to others. These three aspects of the internal potency are the very nature of Bhagavan and thus exist eternally in Him. The samvit potency includes and super- sedes the sandhini potency, and the hladini potency includes and supersedes the other two. This threefold internal energy of Bhaga- van constitutes His very nature and that of His abode and associates. Bra Next, Śrī Jiva establishes that the form of Bhagavan is not mate- rial like that of human beings. It is spiritual and consists of exis- tence, consciousness and bliss (sat-cit-ānanda-rūpatva). Such a form cannot be cognized by ordinary material senses, and yet it is self- revealed by the trans-rational potency of Bhagavan. Unlike mor- tal beings, the form of Bhagavan is not different from His essen- tial nature. Although the form of Bhagavan is one, it can mani- fest in unlimited places in infinite aspects simultaneously, in direct correspondence to the mood of His devotees.antin@swed 
The contradictory attributes of localization and all-pervasive- ness were present in the form of Kṛṣṇa simultaneously. The form of Bhagavan is always beyond the limits of time and place even when manifest in the material world. 
Like the form of Bhagavan, His dress, ornaments, abode and associates are all manifestations of the svarupa-sakti, the internal potency. Similarly, just as Bhagavan's form is nondifferent from His essential being, so too His name is identical with Him. It has the same power as Bhagavan and is similarly beyond the grasp of the material senses. Realizing His name even once can free one from the bondage of the material world. This is why Bengal Vaisnavism lays great stress on nama-japa and nama-sankirtana - celebrating the names of Bhagavan in a solitary quiet manner (japa) or en masse to the accompaniment of music and dance (sankirtana). Śrī Caitanya Mahaprabhu proclaimed that in the present age, Kaliyuga, congre- gational chanting of the names of Bhagavan is the most efficacious means for attaining perfection in spiritual life. The birth, acts, name, form, color and other features of Bhagavan are all spiritual, being

Introduction 
manifestations of His svarupa-sakti; they manifest to enhance the bliss of His devotees. Bhagavan is ātmārāma, one who delights in His own Self, yet He bestows grace upon His devotees. Bhagavan's grace is one of His infinite attributes, and it is an aspect of His partic- ularly wonderful nature whereby He displays His internal bliss. It is through the grace bestowed on His devotees that Bhagavan discloses His birth, form, pastimes and so on. Other than bestowing bliss upon His devotees, there is no other purpose behind such revela- tions because He is inherently complete in Himself. The realization of Bhagavan together with the various unique characteristics con- stituting Him as the essence of Ultimate Reality is said to be perfect and complete. Such complete and perfect realization of Bhagavan is possible only through bhakti. 
Śrī Jiva Gosvāmi concludes Bhagavat Sandarbha with the glori- fication of divine love, prema-bhakti, the only means that self-dis- closes Bhagavan. But to realize the full benefit of bhakti, one must have a clear conceptual understanding of Bhagavan, without any lingering doubts. 
In this way, Jiva Gosvāmi lays the groundwork for abhideya- tattva, or the truth regarding the means of attainment. Therefore, a serious spiritual seeker should invest the time and attention neces- sary to thoroughly study this book with great care, because it forms the indispensible foundation for spiritual practice (sadhanā). 
In this book we have employed certain terminology that may be unfamiliar to the reader. There is an essay in the appendix entitled, "The Language of Transcendence," that lucidly explains these terms and any neologisms. Without going through this essay, one may be at a loss to grasp the precise meaning of the terminology used. There- fore, we recommend readers to first acquaint themselves with this terminology before entering into the book proper.

Loving service to Bhagavan Śrī Kṛṣṇa in the mood of the Vraja gopīs is the ultimate conclusion of all the Vedas and Vedic literature. Śrī Caitanya Mahaprabhu is indeed Kṛṣṇa, the beloved of Rädhä. May this book delight the heart of my guru, who clearly disclosed this unequivocal truth unto me. 
THIS BOOK IS DEDICATED to my guru śrī śrī 108 Śrī Śrotriya Bhagavad-niṣṭha Śrīmad Haridāsa Śāstrī Mahārāja Nava-tirtha, an ideal example of a devotee and ācārya. 
I bow down at the holy feet of my Gurudeva. He taught me with great love most of the works of Śrī Rūpa, Sanatana and Jīva Gosvāmi, and other Gauḍīya ācāryas. The Ṣat Sandarbhas were the first works I studied under him. He was a great admirer of the Gosvāmis, not only through words but by being a strict adherent of their teachings. He was a living example of Gauḍīya Vaisnava theology and philoso- phy. Thus, I learned from him not only during his discourses, but also through being with him, seeing him deal with various life situa- tions, and serving in the gośälä and elsewhere. It is he who inspired me to propagate this knowledge by making it available in English.

verses, the first having the same significance as the third and fourth verses of the mangalacarana of Tattva Sandarbha, and the second being the fifth verse verbatim. Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī did not compose a new mangalācarana at the beginning of Bhagavat Sandarbha because he considered Sat Sandarbhas to form a single book. 
In the first of these two verses, he again remembers the lotus feet of his teachers, Śrīla Rūpa and Sanatana Gosvāmīs, upon whose order the work was undertaken. In the second verse he again expresses gratitude to Śrīla Gopāla Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmi, who originally began it. In this way, he invokes the blessings of these masters for the completion of the work. For further explanation, the reader may refer to the commentaries on the third, fourth and fifth invocatory verses of Tattva Sandarbha.

ŚRILA JIVA PRABHU BEGINS the first anuccheda with the word atha, which signifies continuity from the previous book. It also invokes auspiciousness. In the Vedic culture, the word atha is considered auspicious like Om, as is said: dosha qidazow to shom ara 951

Then he explained that the subject matter of Srimad Bhagavatam is the one nondual Reality, which is conscious in nature. To this end, he cited the first half of SB 1.2.11 in Anuccheda 51:

All those who have realized Absolute Reality refer to that Reality as nondual consciousness. 
This Absolute Reality is called äśraya, or the support and ground of all being. This topic is the culmination of the ten primary sub- jects discussed in Śrīmad Bhagavatam. The first nine subjects are described merely to provide the context for proper understand- ing of this tenth item. So, after introducing Absolute Reality in a general way as nondual consciousness in Tattva Sandarbha, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī now begins Bhagavat Sandarbha with a more specific description.

W to ages 99717 529d? lo smo ni sonsdeixe In the vadanti tat verse, Sūta Gosvāmī explains that Absolute Reality is referred to by three names - Brahman, Paramātmā and Bhagavan. According to Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi, these three different nomenclatures indicate three degrees of competence in the wor- shipers. In Bhagavad Gita Śrī Kṛṣṇa says, "I reveal Myself to all who surrender unto Me, exactly in accordance with the essential nature of their surrender." Yatha, or "in accordance with the essential nature," in this statement signifies the inner disposition of the devo- tee, the mode of worship, the devotee's conceptual outlook in regard to Bhagavan's form, and similar factors that contribute to and define the nature of the surrender undertaken.

1 Absolute Reality Manifests in Three Different Ways 
Taking this into consideration, the words brahma, paramātmā and bhagavan in Suta's verse denote not only the one nondual Abso- lute in three degrees of completion, but also three degrees of com- pletion in surrender. The same nondual Absolute is revealed, and thus interpreted, either as Brahman, Paramātmā or Bhagavan in accordance with the core disposition of surrender, shaped in no small measure by the theory and praxis adopted by the adherents of different paths. 
This implies that if a worshiper has a non-personal concept of the Absolute and cultivates a legitimate process to realize it, then the Absolute will manifest to him as unqualified Brahman. If the worshiper has a personal concept of the Absolute, then he will real- ize the Absolute as Paramātmā or Bhagavan, depending on his spe- cific understanding and the means employed. The adherents of jñāna-yoga realize the Absolute as Brahman, those of aṣṭānga-yoga as Paramātmā, and those of bhakti-yoga as Bhagavan. This is con- firmed by Śri Brahma in his prayers:

itate on and appear to them in that way. (SB 3.9.11)" 
Of course, this last statement does not mean that one can medi- tate on any form and that Bhagavan is thereby bound to appear to the meditator in that way. This idea is precluded by the phrase śruteksita- patha (the way to reach You can be understood through hearing). One has to hear from a qualified source and should meditate on the forms that are described in these authorized texts. 
The word sabdyate ("Reality is referred to as," SB 1.2.11), indicates that it is only the words used to name Reality that differ and not Real- ity itself. Reality is one, advaya, without a second. Nevertheless, the worshipers of this nondual Reality are not all of the same degree of

And of all yogis, he who, endowed with faith, worships Me with his heart- mind-attention fully absorbed in Me is, in My opinion, the greatest of all transcendentalists. (GĪTĀ 6.46-47)8

Absolute Reality, which is indivisible and blissful in nature, is known as Brahman to those transcendentalists (paramahamsas) who have lost all taste for material happiness, even that available to Śrī Brahmā, and who by ardent practice have realized their identity with this Reality, but whose hearts are unable to per- ceive the variegatedness displayed by its internal potencies; they thus experience it in a non-specific way, just as they have sought it. In this manner, when the Absolute Truth is defined without distinguishing between the conscious energetic Source and its energies, it is called Brahman.

That very same Absolute Reality is named Bhagavan when, as the reservoir of all other transcendental energies, it manifests unique characteristics by the power of its internal potency and becomes revealed to the senses, both internal and external, of the devotional transcendentalists (bhāgavata-paramahamsas). For such devotees the bliss of encountering the Absolute replete with its innate attributes subsumes the bliss of Brahman realization. The senses of such devotees are transmuted through devotion, which itself is a specific aspect of the conscious bliss-potency and the sole efficient cause making possible this realization. So, when the Absolute Truth is defined precisely in this manner, taking into consideration the distinction between the conscious energetic Source and its energies, it is known as Bhagavan.

Reality is never designated as jiva or the individual self, however, for the jivas are not the conscious whole, but rather, conscious parts of that whole and manifestations of Bhagavan's intermediary potency, taṭastha-sakti, for they are distinct both from His intrinsic nature and from His external potency that manifests as the cosmos. 
odbe bar 
ovah 
The jiva, although an integrated part of the Supreme Whole, is yet distinct from Absolute Reality in itself. This was clearly demon- strated by the analysis of Śrīla Vyasa's trance in Anucchedas 30-49 of Tattva Sandarbha. This certainly refutes the theory that the non- dual Absolute Reality becomes the jiva when conditioned by māyā. If such were the case, Śrī Sūta Gosvāmi would surely have included the word jiva along with Brahman, Paramātmā and Bhagavan in the vadanti tat verse. It can thus be concluded from his statement that learned transcendentalists never designate Absolute Reality by the word jiva. However, in those cases where Bhagavan is so named, as in SB 11.24.27 (kālo māyā-maye jīve), the word should be interpreted to mean that He is the source of everyone's life -jivayati iti jīvaḥ. 
The specific order of the three names given - Brahman, Param- ātmā and Bhagavan - implies that Paramātmā is a realization of the Absolute superior to Brahman, and that Bhagavan is the ulti- mate stage of realization. One may object that since Brahman is mentioned first, it should be considered superior to Paramātmā and so on, but this objection is refuted by the hermeneutic prin- ciple stating that a sequence ordered by meaning takes precedence over the sequence as read (patha-kramad artha-kramo baliyan, Artha- sangraha 39). For example, in the Vedas one will find the statement agni-hotram juhoti, "He performs the Agnihotra sacrifice." Later, however, it says yavāgūṁ pacati, "He cooks yavāgū (a special prepa- ration used in the sacrifice)." Although here the cooking of yavāgū is mentioned after the performance of the sacrifice, such cooking naturally has to be done before the sacrifice; otherwise, preparing it serves no purpose and the sacrifice itself would be futile due to not having any yavāgū. In this case, the sequence of events should be understood in accordance with the meaning rather than the order in which the texts appear. The same applies in the case of Sūta Gosvāmi's listing of Brahman, Paramātmā and Bhagavan. 
127 
2 Distinction Between Brahman and Bhagavan 
To clarify this sequence, Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmi begins by defin- ing the three types of realization. Brahman is the Absolute when realized as unqualified Being / Awareness. Bhagavan is the same Absolute when realized as the Supreme Person, understood as the condensed essence of Being/ Awareness, naturally and inherently endowed with unlimited self-existent potencies. Paramātmā is the same Supreme Person manifest as the Supreme Immanent pervad- ing all matter and spirit. Paramātmā is the Absolute in its feature of regulation, rulership, mastery, witnessing, preservation and control. In order to regulate the activities of material nature, He expands into various Paramātmā forms by which He pervades and sustains both macrocosm and microcosm. A detailed exposition of Paramātmā will follow in Paramätma Sandarbha, but for the time being, Jiva states that he will proceed to explain Brahman and Bha- gavan first, by which the nature of Paramātmā will be understood automatically. 
A paramahamsa means an ascetic of the highest order, as stated by Lord Siva to Uma: 
Ascetics are of four types - kuțicaka, bahūdaka, hamsa and parama- hamsa, each of which is successively superior to the previous. (MB, Anusasana-parva 141.89) loadAnt vison of sidemirsis your villisubila broyed antemor toy bas mot lansbaso8 There are essentially two types of paramahamsas or transcenden- talists, the jñānis and the bhāgavatas. Jñāni-paramahamsas are those who are disposed to the Absolute as unqualified Being; bhāgavata- paramahamsas are those who are disposed to the Absolute as per- sonal nondual Being, which is not an imposition of limiting charac- teristics on unqualified Being, as commonly conceived, but rather, the condensed essence of Being / Awareness disclosed in and by the interiority of nondual awareness. Śrī Kṛṣṇa explains the qual- ities and activities of the first type of paramahamsa in chapter 18 of the Eleventh Canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. The second type is described in chapter 3 of the same canto by the sage Hari. Dattatreya, Vamadeva, the four Kumāras before they cursed the Vaikuntha caturvidha bhiksavas te kuṭīcaka-bahūdakauis ad loadA ad ol hamsaḥ paramahamsaś ca yo yaḥ paścat sa uttamaḥ Vegas

gatekeepers, Jaya and Vijaya, and so on, are examples of the first type. Prahlada, Narada, Uddhava and the gopis of Vraja are exam- ples of the second type. Agnis batillinen posifa 
Jñani-paramahamsas have no material desire for anything even up to the bliss of Satyaloka, the planet of Śri Brahma, but they are predisposed to conceive of all characteristics, such as name, form, qualities, action and personhood, as dualistic impositions on Spirit, as they most certainly are in conventional phenomenal exis- tence. In doing so, however, they deny the possibility of nondual consciousness being inherently self-endowed with transcendental characteristics that are not subject to the defects and limitations of their material counterparts and that in no way violate its integrity of being nondual. Because of this denial, they fail to recognize transconventional personhood as the concealed essence of nondual being, and thus they generally are not inclined to render service to God in His personal aspect. 
The jñānis understand that the cause of material misery is dual- ity and that the only solution is to see through it. With this inspi- ration they cultivate awareness of their oneness with the Absolute and observe the nature of material attachment so as to transcend it. They are unable to conceive that Absolute Reality is inclusive of tran- scendental form and yet remains beyond all duality. Because of this limitation, implicit in their conceptual outlook, they cannot realize the Absolute as God, or more specifically, as Personal Nondual Being (Bhagavan) replete with internal potencies, just as persons who have no ear for classical music cannot appreciate its subtleties. They can- not distinguish between the fine melodies of a raga, and so all the exquisite features of a virtuoso's recital are wasted on them; they can only perceive undifferentiated sound in the raga and nothing else. In the same way, jñāni-paramahamsas realize the Absolute with such radical non-distinction that they fail to perceive its own concealed internal specificity. Thus, they realize the Absolute only as devoid of any manifest qualities (Brahman). 
From this, one should not misconstrue that there is no variety in the Absolute, but neither should one consider that Brahman is different from Bhagavan. Therefore, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi says, ekam

2 Distinction Between Brahman and Bhagavan 
evākhaṇḍānanda-svarupam, "The one indivisible Absolute, which is blissful in nature." The Absolute realized by both types of parama- hamsas is one and the same, but still their realization differs. It is just as when the above-mentioned virtuoso performs for an audience in which some people have awareness and appreciation of his abilities, and others do not. He delights in the display of his art, which gives pleasure both to himself and to those who are capable of fully rec- ognizing his qualities. On the other hand, those lacking the ability to appreciate such a fine musical recital, even though present in the same audience, will fail to derive the same degree of pleasure from the very same performance. Ised an 
In this example, the performer is one, but the two different grades of people in the audience appreciate him differently and experience a different level of enjoyment. The experience of those with greater refinement in music culture is superior to those igno- rant of the merits of fine music, and yet their appreciation also includes the experience of the less refined members of the audi- ence. Similarly, the realization of the bhagavata-paramahamsas is beyond that of the jñāni-paramahamsas, but includes their Brahman realization as well. In this regard, Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī writes in Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu: 96

Even if the bliss of Brahman realization were to be multiplied mil- lions of times, it could not compare to a drop from the blissful ocean of bhakti. (BRS 1.1.38)4

They realize Him externally as well, with senses that have become purified by Bhagavan's internal potency. They are able to perceive Bhagavān along with His variegated energies, all of which are inconceivable to conventional logic.

veged Śrī Bhagavat Sandarbhad 
To prove that the one Absolute has three names based on the realizations of the worshiper, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi cites two verses, SB 5.12.11 and SB 4.11.30. The first of these is an instruction from Jada Bharata to King Rahugana. In it, the phrase jñānam viśuddham (pure consciousness), paramartha (the ultimate of that which is to be attained), eka (One), anantaram abahih (devoid of any internal or external divisions), and satya (Truth), are all determinants of Brahman. Pratyak (situated in the heart of every living being) and praśänta (unperturbed) refer to Paramātmā. 
This same Absolute Reality is Bhagavan, also called Vasudeva. Vasudeva is a name for Kṛṣṇa, because His father's name is Vasudeva. Kavi in this verse means those who are highly conversant with the truth of scripture. They recognize Śrī Kṛṣṇa as the Absolute Real- ity, para-tattva. Śrīla Viśvanatha Cakravarti Thakura also points out that this verse is an expansion of the vadanti tat verse (SB 1.2.11). 
In SB 4.11.30 ananda-matra (indistinguished bliss) refers to Brah- man and pratyag-ātmā (the Self within all selves) to Paramātmā. Upapanna-samasta-sakti (comprehending all potencies) is an adjec- tive referring to Bhagavan. Since Srimad Bhagavatam is the mature fruit of the Vedic tree (nigama-kalpa-taror galitam phalam), and since according to Garuda Purana it supplies the meaning of Vedanta- sutra, it reconciles the various manifestations of the Absolute described in the Vedic literature in different ways. Although dif- ferent transcendentalists follow diverse processes and worship a variety of forms of the Absolute as Supreme, Śrīmad Bhāgavatam explains that Reality is one only, but manifests differently according to the qualification of the worshiper. 
betsemweg notior isubuon Now Śrila Jiva Gosvāmi will analyze the three manifestations of the Absolute Truth and discuss the meaning of the word bhagavān according to Visnu Purāna.

FROM THIS IT IS CONCLUDED that bliss or ananda is the unquali- fied substantive ( viśesya), all the energies its qualifiers (viśesana), and Bhagavān the qualified substantive ( viśista ) ! In this way, being qualified by all His potencies, Bhagavan is the indivisible or total Reality (akhanda-tattva) because He is the complete man- ifestation of the Absolute Truth. From this it is concluded that because Brahman exhibits no specific qualities, it is an incom- plete manifestation of that Truth. This will be explained in detail later on. determin

It is the ultimate basis of everything and the Reality disclosed through meditation for the seekers of liberation. It R is the subtle truth described in the words of the Vedas, the sup- reme seat of Śrī Viṣṇu. This Brahman is the essential nature of Paramātmā and is denoted by the word bhagavan.

3 Bhagavan as the Qualified Absolute 
O sage, the letter bha has two meanings - nourisher and sup-e porter. The letter ga has three meanings - leader, carrier and m ad creator. The six qualities of controlling potency, inconceivable power, fame, wealth, knowledge and absence of attachment, in their totality are called bhaga. All the living beings reside (vas- ananti) in Bhagavan, who is God within and the Self of all creation, and He also resides in them. This is the meaning of the letter va. Therefore, He is the imperishable Reality. (VP 6.5.73-75)* 
इति चोक्त्वा (वि० पु० ६/५/७९ ) - 
Parāśara then concludes:

The word bhagavan means complete knowledge, sensory power, bodily strength, controlling power, inconceivable power and effulgence or beauty, devoid of any repelling qualities. (VP 6.5.79)5

As before, the Absolute here also must be understood according to the previously given divisions of viseşya, the substantive to be determined; viseṣaṇa, its attributes; and visișta, the substantive after it has been determined by knowing its attributes. It will be explained later that these attributes are also transcendental. The phrase arupaṁ pāņi-pāda-ādi-asaṁyutam (formless and thus devoid of hands and legs), points only to the manifestation of the

substantive (viśeşya), known as Brahman, which is yet to be deter- mined. The six words beginning with aiśvaryasya samagrasya, the six qualities of controlling potency, and so on, are simply the determinants (viseṣana) that qualify it; whereas the words vibhu, bhagavan and so on, indicate the Supreme Reality who possesses

Alternatively, words like arupa, or formless, can be understood as denying the material nature of His form, etc. Therefore, it should be known that the phrase pāņi-pada-ādi-asaṁyuta denies only the relation of contact (samyoga-sambandha) and not the relation of inherence (samavāya-sambandha).

Vibhu indicates that the Absolute is endowed with all opulence and sarva-gata (all-pervading) means without division or separa- tion. Vyäpi means all-pervading, and avyäpya means that noth- ing else can pervade it. The nature of Brahman as explained here is directly expressed by the word bhagavan and not simply indi- cated. To establish this, the verse says that the word bhagavan is the direct expression, or vācaka, of the Supreme Truth, just as the word ganga is the direct expression of a specific river and not an indicator like the word tata (riverbank). This being the case, applying the rule of Nirukta 2.1.1, "One should determine a word's meaning on the basis of the etymology derived from its constituent syllables," as well as by its conventional usage, the

operly, the Aiśvarya [from VP 6.5.74 above] is Bhagavan's feature by which everything exists under His control.

In the above verse, the nouns, such as sambharta (nourisher), sig- nify the qualities implicit in those nouns, such as sambhartṛtva, the quality or state of being a nourisher. This follows the rule, "A combination of inflected verbs and nouns constitutes a sentence" (Amara-koşa 1.6.2). Thus, a statement like pacati bhavati (cook- ing is happening) actually means that cooking is going on. Or, as in the usage sattāyām asti bhavati (existing is happening), the speaker's intent is that the verbs asti and bhavati, both of which indicate existence, actually signify the meaning of the infinitive, "to be." Only by understanding the qualities of Bhagavan as inher- ent states of being and not as mere attributions can the word bha- gavān be said to carry the meaning of the suffix matup [implying, ordinarily, possession or endowment].

The verse that begins with jñāna-sakti (VP 6.5.79) explains the six opulences in a different way: Jñana is the characteristic of the psychical apparatus (the antaḥ-karana or internal organ), śakti is sensory power, and bala, bodily strength. The terms aiśvarya and virya have already been explained above. Tejas means "effulgence" or "beauty," and aśeşatas, in completeness. The concluding phrase bhagavat-sabda-vacyāni means that these are the qualities of Bhagavan; they are not just indicatives (upalakṣaṇa).

When this tattva in the form of Bhagavan, which has all the above- stated qualities and is the complete manifestation of Absolute Reality, is described or realized as the controller/regulator of living beings by the process described before, He is called Param- ātmā, or God as the Supreme Immanent. Although generally each of these three words - brahma, paramātmā and bhaga- văn - includes the meanings of the other two, the distinction is nevertheless made to point out their respective predominant intent.

BEFORE WE CAN DEAL APPROPRIATELY with an entity, we must understand it in truth. If an entity is not understood properly, there is a possibility one can be misled. Therefore, before saying anything about Bhagavan, the word bhagavan itself must be properly defined. For this reason, Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī starts this section by giving us a definition of Bhagavan. A definition serves two functions - it helps us to draw a distinction between the object defined and others, and it allows us to then use the term appropriately, either in speech or in experience. motor szimistab of 
Every substance, dravya, has three aspects: its state as an unqual- ified object (viśeşya), its qualifying attributes10 (viseșana), and the same object qualified with its attributes (visista). In the phrase, "white cow," for example, "white" is the quality (viseșana) that distin- guishes one particular cow from others, which may be grey, brown or some other color. The word "cow" refers to the animal in gen- eral, without its quality of being white. Here, we are calling this the object without attributes (viśeşya), for "cow" does not stand for any particular cow and so makes no distinction between one cow and

attributes are general.

another. This does not imply, however, that cows in general have no qualities, such as color. It is just that by saying only "cow," the speaker does not convey any attributes that are specific to a partic- ular cow. The general attributes, however, are understood from the very definition of the word "cow" itself. adt at vitnt aid nad W 
In the phrase "white cow," both the substance and its attributes are stated together, resulting in "cow" becoming the qualified object or substantive (visiṣṭa). The quality, "white," and its object, "cow," when stated separately do not convey a complete unit of informa- tion; whereas, when stated together, they describe the qualified substantive. 
A quality cannot exist without its object, nor is there any sub- stance without qualities," although it is possible to perceive a qual- ity alone without knowing its substantive. Though it is impossible to perceive an object without its qualities, sometimes the perception may be so hazy that the perceiver is unable to clearly distinguish the qualities from the qualified or strike a relation between them. This experience is called indeterminate perception, or nirvikalpaka- pratyakṣa.

According to Vedic logic (nyaya-darśana), the initial moment of perception of an object is always indeterminate! It is in the second moment that we obtain clear perception of the object under favor- able conditions for the appropriate sensory organ. This perception is termed "determinate," or sa-vikalpaka-pratyakṣa. In this conversion from indeterminate to determinate perception, the object remains the same, but the observer's perception undergoes a change. Before knowledge becomes determinate, as in, "This is a book," perception is at first indeterminate, as in, "This is something." The knowledge, "This is a book," is qualified knowledge. It contains knowledge of the book, the class or category to which books can be said to belong, i.e., their bookness, and the relation of the specific book to its class. Qual- ified knowledge can be obtained only if one has prior knowledge of

the attributes by which it is qualified. For example, in the statement, "This is a tridandi sannyasi,"13 the sannyasi is the unqualified noun, and tridanda, its qualifier. Though the two have a relation of con- tact, unless one knows what a tridanda is, he can never derive the significance of the words, "This is a tridandi sannyāsī."don 2012 30 Similarly, the knowledge, "This is a book," is first acquired by knowing the class of "bookness," which is the quality, or viseṣaṇa, for the unqualified object (viśeşya) book. Without knowledge of bookness, the item "book" cannot be understood. Therefore, we are forced to accept that we first obtain knowledge of bookness and of the book without any knowledge of their relation. This is called indeterminate knowledge because it cannot be described to others. We then obtain determinate knowledge of the book, with bookness being its inherent quality. Śrī Kumārila Bhaṭṭa describes this as follows: 
tada

At the very beginning of perception one obtains indeterminate by knowledge in the form of mere observation. This is like the cogni- tion of an infant or the mute, arising purely out of the object without any distinction of quality and qualified. (Śloka-värttika 4.112)14 
Similarly, Absolute Reality is one, but one's perception of it can be either indeterminate or determinate. The peculiarity of Abso- lute Reality is that the worshiper can remain at the level of indeter- minate awareness and not proceed to determinate awareness. This indicates that the worshiper's qualification still lacks higher-order completion. For, as described in the previous section, Absolute Real- ity manifests itself according to the qualification of the worshiper. Indeterminate realization is called Brahman.tally A 
In SB 4.11.30, cited at the end of Section 2, 
the words ananda- mātra (pure bliss) refer to the viśeşya. The various energies denoted by the word samasta-sakti are the viseṣaṇa, and Bhagavan is the qual- ified entity, replete with energies. Therefore, it is established that

Bhagavan is the complete manifestation and realization of Absolute Reality, and thus Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmi calls Him akhanda-tattva-rupa, or the indivisible Reality. Nothing exists outside of Him, because all energies are within Him. Although He and His qualities or ener- gies cannot be separated, it is nonetheless possible to realize Him without them. Such partial realization, or asamyag-āvirbhāva, of the Absolute is called Brahman. Despite this difference in percep- tion, Brahman is the same as Bhagavan, in the same way that when a mountain is seen from a distance, at first only a homogeneously green object is detected, but as one comes closer to it, more and more variety is perceived, even though it is one and the same mountain. 275 In this regard it should be noted that, according to Śrila Jiva Gosvāmi, the energies of Bhagavän are not exactly related as qual- ities to the qualified. He uses the words visista, viseṣaṇa and viśeşya only to convey the idea that the energies belong to Bhagavan, and that Brahman is not an independent manifestation. Jiva argues that the real relationship between Bhagavan and His energies is that of inconceivable simultaneous oneness and difference, or acintya- bheda-abheda. This will be further explained in Anuccheda 16. The import of the word viseṣana here is "energy" and not its usual sense of a qualifier. Śrī Rāmānujācārya taught Viṣiṣṭādvaitavada, or qual- ified nonduality, in which he described the material world as an adjective (viseșana) of Bhagavan. Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi offers some 
refutations to this doctrine in his Sarva-saṁvādīnī and shows that the Acintya-bhedabheda-vāda ideology of Śrī Caitanya Mahaprabhu offers a more thorough explanation of the relationship between the Supreme Lord and His energies. boosfoss) 
After explaining that Bhagavan is the complete, indivisible Absolute, replete with energies, Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī cites scrip- tural evidence to substantiate his doctrine. This is the Vedic sys- tem. Among educated society, no discussion of transcendental knowledge is taken seriously without scriptural evidence, or sastra- pramāņa, to back up every conclusion. So, Jiva Gosvāmī turns to Visnu Purana to quote the definitions of Bhagavan found there. Para- śara Muni, the father of Vedavyāsa, speaks these verses to Maitreya. The verses can be analyzed according to the three categories 
26 
3 Bhagavan as the Qualified Absolute 
already encountered-viśeşya, viseṣaṇa and visiṣṭa. Descriptions like "formless," "without bodily limbs" and so on, denote the indeter- minate Brahman feature; words such as "knowledge," "beauty" and so on, identify the qualities of Bhagavan; and terms like "supreme," "nourisher," etc., denote the qualified Lord. 3018

An alternative interpretation is that these verses speak exclu- sively about Bhagavan, and phrases like "no form" mean that He has no material form. This idea is presented in Uttara-khanda of Padma Purāna: 
eds yduraqur bestibom to an amerill beonitun gaisd als dialdiak visti dros don al ald 
vistairs When scriptures describe Bhagavan as nirguna, or devoid of qual- brities, it means that He is free from material qualities, which are 
inferior in nature. (PP 6.227.41)15 
Śrī Vāsudevādhyātma states: 
Because Bhagavan's qualities are not known to people, He is calledford anāmā (lit., "one who has no name"); and because His form is not material, He is called arupa (lit., "one who has no form"). air (LBH 1.248) 16 
Jiva 
If the Absolute had no name and form whatsoever, Śruti state- ments that make mention of Bhagavan's form, such as the following verse, would become meaningless: 
One who sees that golden-complexioned Supreme Person, the Sup- reme Lord and ultimate actor, who is the source of Brahman, then, shaking off piety and sin, he becomes free from all material bondage Sand attains supreme similarity with Bhagavan. (MUU 3.1.3)17

called acintya, or inconceivable. The words ajara and aja mean free from old age and birth. Since He has no birth, there is no death for Him. Akṣaya means that no decay or transformation occurs in Him. This further implies that He is free from the six types of transforma- tion found in the material body. Anirdeśya means that He is beyond speech, as stated in TU 2.4.1, "From whom all speech along with the mind turn away, unable to reach Him."18 vigada queda visviz 
This does not mean, however, that Bhagavan cannot be described through words or meditated upon by the mind. The import is that He is not completely expressible in words, being unlimited. There are many statements asserting that Bhagavan can be known from the Vedas, such as sarve veda yat padam amananti, "He whom all the Vedas declare" (KU 2.15), and vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyaḥ, "I alone, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, am to be known through all the Vedas" (GĪTĀ 15.15). 
The phrase pāņi-pada-ādi-asamyuta negates the idea that the rela- tion of Bhagavan to His limbs is one of contact. According to logic, relations between different objects can be of many kinds, out of which two are principal - conjunction, or samyoga, and inherence, or samaväya: 
The relation existing between two inseparable things is one of inher- ence; that between any other two is conjunction or contact. (Tarka- bhāṣā 10)19 
amooed blow y adjective 
When a book is on a table, the relation between them is one of contact. This is a temporary relation. On the other hand, the rela- tion between milk and its color is one of inherence. This is a lasting relation. Unless the milk is transformed into something else, the relation between it and its color cannot be violated. 
While giving his alternative interpretation of "formless and devoid of hands, legs and other such bodily limbs," Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī argues that when Visnu Purāṇa makes such statements about Absolute Reality, it means that the relation between Bhaga- van and His limbs is an inherent one, not one of contact; that is to say, the relation is eternal, unlike the relation of an ordinary

human being's body to his or her limbs. In other words, what is being negated is Bhagavan's possession of ordinary hands and legs in the human or material sense, and not the complete absence of limbs.insar botsoifini ada yigge 
Bhagavan is the source of all living beings, bhūta-yoni, as stated in Bhagavad Gita, "I am the source of everything" (aham sarvasya prabhavaḥ, GITA 10.8). Therefore, He is akarana: He Himself has no cause or source. This too is confirmed in Bhagavad Gītā, "O Arjuna, there is nothing at all beyond Me" (mattaḥ parataram nanyat kiñcid asti dhananjaya, GĪTĀ 7.7). This means that He is not dependent on any other source for His own being. He pervades everything, vyāpi, but nothing pervades or contains Him - maya tatam idam sarvam (GĪTĀ 9.4). This means that Bhagavan is in contact with everything at all times.

The Vedas often mention Brahman with the attributes stated in the verses spoken by Parāśara. For this reason, Brahman is called aupaniṣada-puruşa - the personality known from the Vedas (tam tv aupaniṣadam puruşam prcchami, BAU 3.9.26). The word bhagavan directly expresses the nature of Brahman, or Absolute Reality; Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi says that the word bhagavan not only indicates the nature of Brahman, but directly defines it. According to rhetori- cians, a meaningful word, or pada, has three types of force, which give it three kinds of meanings: literal, indicated and suggested.20 The meaning that immediately comes to mind upon hearing a word is called its literal or direct meaning. This meaning arises from the power of the word called abhidha. For example, as soon as a Vaisnava hears the word kṛṣṇa, it immediately reminds her or him of Śrī Kṛṣṇa. 
900 9100 
Sometimes, however, the literal meaning is inappropriate because it does not convey the sense of the speaker. When this happens, one applies another possible force of the word, known as lakṣaṇā-śakti or gauņi-vṛtti, which supplies a secondary meaning. This is called lakṣyārtha, or indicated meaning. This indicated mean- ing is clearly related to the direct one, but adds to or modifies it.

For example, in the statement, "The Jiva Institute is situated on Jiva Road," the literal meaning of "on" would be absurd. Surely the insti- tute could not be situated upon the road, where it would impede the flow of traffic! In such a case we apply the indicated meaning and understand that the institute is in fact situated beside the road. 
The third type of meaning is vyangyartha, the suggested meaning. It is defined in Sahitya-darpana as follows: (8 or Ario dovaddo 
hso 
The vyanjana-vṛtti, or suggestive force of the word, is that which ad ho gives an altogether different meaning to the word after all the possibilities presented by the abhidha and lakṣaṇa potencies have been exhausted, i.e., having explored their literal and indicated meanings. (SD 2.12)21 
Sinne Sri K 
To expand on the above example, if taken literally, the phrase "on Jiva Road" would be impractical, so the lakṣaṇa-vṛtti allows us to conclude that the temple is beside the road. But even beyond this, the vyanjana-vṛtti will continue to imply other ideas: e.g., Jiva Insti- tute is easily approachable by vehicle; one does not have to walk a great distance to it after leaving his vehicle, and so on. Vyañjană is not directly related to the word meanings in a sentence. 
EVIL 
Since there is no impediment to understanding the primary meaning of words such as avyakta, Śrīla Jīva Gosvām says that bhagavan is a vācaka; its direct meaning is clear and one need not refer to either the secondary or indicated meanings. If an indicated meaning is applied, then Brahman would be absolutely inexpress- ible by words in their primary sense, which goes against the Śruti statements. Furthermore, one would be forced to find a different primary meaning for the word bhagavan, but there is no scriptural support for any other meaning. There is no possibility of an indi- cated meaning without a primary meaning. Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī is stressing this point keeping in mind the Advaitavāda view that con- siders Brahman (the unqualified Absolute) to be the lakṣyartha of the word brahma, because if instead Brahman were accepted as the

primary meaning of the word brahma, there would be duality of the word and its meaning.no boog gnid of brus laod toadong of als neeThe word ganga refers to a famous river in India; that is its pri- mary meaning. But the word tata (riverbank), may have any river as one of its indicated meanings. When it is said that a boat is on the bank of the river, it really means that it is on the water near the bank. Here the word "bank" refers to the river itself. In the verses quoted from Visnu Purāṇa, the word bhagavan was used in its direct or primary sense. A 
Sometimes the word bhagavan is used to address great persons, such as in SB 1.4.2, where Sukadeva Gosvāmī is so addressed. In such cases, it is being used in a secondary sense, since the pri- mary meaning is inappropriate and does not convey the intent of the speaker. Here bhagavan simply means an honorable or very powerful individual.z.cambroodbedribadinofal SedIn the second set of three verses, VP 6.5.73-75, Parāśara Muni sup- plies the meaning of bhagavan according to the principles of Nirukta, a commentary on the Vedic dictionary Nighantu, which gives a list of selected Vedic words. Yäska, the author of Nirukta, gives the etymo- logical meaning of those words. He uses many principles to derive his etymologies. One of these is to take the meaning of a word from the similarity of its component syllables to known verbal roots. In the crude form bhagavat, the syllable bha resembles the verbal root √bhrñ, which means "to support," or "to nourish;" ga resembles √gam (to go); and va is similar to √vas (to live). In explaining the mean- ing of bhagavat, Parāśara Muni uses the Nirukta rule by giving the meaning of each syllable, but he also gives the idiomatic meaning, or rudhy-artha, along with it. 
According to logicians as well as rhetoricians, the literal meaning of a word is of three types - yoga, rudhi and yoga-ruḍhi, i.e., etymo- logical, idiomatic and a combination of the two. Out of these three, the idiomatic meaning always takes precedence. The maxim is yogād rūḍhir baliyasi, "A word's idiomatic meaning is more powerful than its etymological meaning." 
The word virya means "inconceivable power," as seen in gems and experienced with mantras. According to Vedic astrology, gems 
31 
Stutor Śri Bhagavat Sandarbha 
have an inconceivable power to ward off the bad influence of plan- ets, to protect health, and to bring good fortune. In olden days kings wore precious gems in their crowns and ornaments that were chosen in accordance with astrological calculations. The potency of these gems was experienced, though it could not be explained logically. Similarly, Bhagavan has numerous inconceivable potencies, such as those displayed in His Vṛndāvana pastimes, like brahma-mohana-līlā or dama-bandhana-lila.vopard brow ad annuun moit bosoup 
Vairagya means absence of attachment. Although Bhagavan (indirectly) creates this gigantic cosmos with innumerable planets, He is not attached to it. He happily sleeps in the causal ocean and even annihilates the creation, in the same way that a baby crushes a toy in the midst of play. 250b bus oshqoqgent al pinsomm 
When the letters bha, ga and va are combined, the stem bhagava is formed. Then, in accordance with sutra PANINI 5.2.94, tad asyāsty asminn iti matup, the tad-dhita suffix matup is applied in the sense of possession. Another Panini-sūtra22 ordains that when the matup suffix follows a stem ending in -a or -ã, the consonant m is changed to v. So, instead of bha-ga-va-mat, the form bha-ga-va-vat is generated. In Vedic usage (chändasa), the syllable va of matup is dropped to get the crude form bhagavat, which then takes the word bhagavan in the masculine nominative singular. 
According to the Paninīyan school of grammar, possessive suffixes like matup are applied in seven different situations:

bha-ga-va. Bhagavan can thus never be a word indicating something other than its direct meaning.sgs doidwyd gnidarwon gaiad basThe followers of Sankarācārya do not accept that Brahman, or Absolute Reality, possesses any energies, for this would go against their doctrine of radical monism. They therefore contend that words like brahma or bhagavan do not directly define the Absolute, but only indicate or designate it indirectly. By such arguments they try to defend the Absolute from any taint of duality. In his analysis of the verses of Parāśara Muni, however, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi conclusively establishes that bhagavan is a vacaka and not a lakṣaka, or indicator, because the matup suffix designates nitya-yoga, or eternal relation. 
He further substantiates his explanation by quoting VP 6.5.79, which offers a different meaning of the word bhagavan. This verse clearly states that these qualities are văcya, direct expressions of Bhagavan (bhagavat-sabda-vacyāni), and not indicators. That is why Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi again concludes that matup is applied in the sense of nitya-yoga, or eternal inherence of qualities. basim2000 
Words like sambharta (nourisher) and bhartă (supporter) imply the actions of nourishing and supporting. Although they are nouns, their significance is in the actions they describe. This is in accor- dance with the definition of a sentence given in Amara-koşa 1.6.2, "A sentence is a combination of nouns (tin) and verbs (sup)." The Rāmāśrami commentator to this verse says that a sentence may be composed of only nouns, such as prakṛti-siddham idam hi mahat- manām (Hitopadesa 1.32), of only verbs, such as pacati bhavati, or with a combination of both. While commenting on Yoga-sūtra 3.17, Vyasa also writes that every word has the power to form a sentence, sarva-padeṣv asti vakya-śaktiḥ. By this Śrī Jiva informs us that when a sentence is constructed of nouns alone, a verb is to be assumed because there is no sentence without a verb. 
Thus, although words such as sambharta are nouns, they indicate the action of nourishing, or the ever-present state of being nourish- ing. This clearly indicates that Bhagavan has the quality and energy to act. He is not an impotent abstract principle attributed with the name sambhartā, or nourisher, but who has no power to nourish, or who remains unmoved to do so, or who has merely incidental and 
33 
log Śrī Bhagavat Sandarbha la p 
not inherent capacity to nourish. He eternally manifests the state of being nourishing, by which agency alone the cosmos and all beings are sustained, moment to moment. He is not like the modern head of state who may be commander-in-chief of an army but who has no expertise in warfare and never personally fights. Therefore, accord- ing to Jiva, words such as sambharta, which are nouns, refer to states of being that signify action and energy. The matup suffix is then applied on bha-ga-va to obtain a noun. The suffix matup thus carries the sense of activity and energy in Bhagavan. MiTo eazzav (Because Bhagavan has, or is inclusive of, all potencies in their fullness, He is the most complete manifestation of the Absolute. When He expands Himself as the Purusa to regulate the affairs of material nature and the jiva, He is called Paramātmā. Bhagavan has three such Puruşa expansions - Kāraṇodakaśāyī, Garbhodakaśāyi and Kṣirodakaśāyi (related to the causal, subtle and gross dimen- sions of being, or in different language, the meta-macrocosmic, the macrocosmic and the microcosmic). The Purusa expansion who abides as the Supreme Immanent Self in every living being is an expansion of Kṣirodakaśāyi Viṣṇu. Since each of these Paramātmā expansions has a specific function, they do not manifest all of Bhaga- vān's potencies, just as a strong man who has to lift a book does not manifest all his might to do so. As such, Paramātmā is considered to be a less complete manifestation of Bhagavan. In Brahman, no qualities at all are manifest; hence, Brahman is less complete even than Paramātmā. Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmi thus says that the sequence in SB 1.2.11 is in increasing order of completion. odnos duiw 
In the next anuccheda, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi will identify Bhagavan as Nārāyaṇa and explain the conscious nature of the jiva. hog-ayo bamaze

The purport of Nimi's question is as follows: The word nārāyaṇa refers to Bhagavan because it appears with the other two words, brahma (Brahman) and paramātmā, which are found with bhaga- vän as the third member of the group, just as in SB 1.2.11. That nārāyaṇa and bhagavan have the same meaning is stated in Śri- mad Bhagavatam: rela 
“स्वांशेन विष्टः पुरुषाभिधानमवाप नारायण आदिदेवः” (भा० ११।४ । ३) इत्यत्र तत्समाना- र्थत्वात् । 
When the primeval Śrī Nārāyaṇa generated His cosmic form out TAP of the five elements produced from Himself and then entered yan within that cosmic body in the form of His own plenary portion, 
He became known as the Purusa [Paramātmā]. (SB 11.4.3)3

This identity of meaning will also be depicted in SB 10.14.14,* which gives the derivative sense of the word nārāyaṇa.

In this regard, we say the following: Ahetu, or acausal, means that although the Absolute is indifferent to material nature due to exclusive involvement in the play of His internal potency, in His manifestation as Paramātmā, which is another name for the plenary manifestation called Purușa, He becomes the cause of

Thus, the form of Paramātmā is contained within Bhagavan. This is described further on in the verse: Know Him to be the Paramātmā, who enlivens the jiva, His part, by entering it and activating its body, senses and so on, implying that He enters all the cosmic princi- ples (tattvas), beginning with pradhana (the unmanifest primor- dial nature).

In his commentary on Varuna's prayers to Śrī Kṛṣṇa, "I offer my obeisances unto You, who are Bhagavan, Brahman and Param- ātmā" (SB 10.28.6), Śrīdhara Svāmī similarly states that Param- ātmā means the controller, regulator and guide of all living beings (paramātmane sarva-jiva-niyantre). The living being is consciousness and is conscious (atmatva). In comparison to him, Bhagavan is Supreme Consciousness and supremely conscious

(paramatva). The word paramātmā thus implies that He is the jiva's benefactor. The Absolute without these qualifications is called Brahman, whose existence is described in the verse by the phrase, "He pervades the various states of wakefulness, dream- ing, and deep sleep, and also exists beyond them." The aspect [of the Absolute] that remains undifferentiated from the jiva in the states of wakefulness, dreaming and deep sleep, and which shines beyond them as pure consciousness in states like trance (samādhi), is to be known as Brahman:

Waking, dreaming and deep sleep are the three modifications of the faculty of intellect (buddhi) and are caused by the gunas of material nature. The living being within the body is different from these three states and is a witness to them. (SB 11.13.27)

In light of the above verse, though the pure nature of the jiva is the truth being explained in the statement, "He pervades the various states of wakefulness, dreaming and deep sleep, and also exists beyond them," its purpose is not limited to that. The real purpose is to explain the complete consciousness [of Brahman], which encompasses the potency of the jiva. When it is not pos- sible to depict an object fully, a portion of it is shown, just as the part of the ocean directly present in front of one's pointing finger is referred to as the entire ocean. It is the perception of nondifference alone that allows Brahman to be apprehended; hence, it is appropriate to consider Brahman and the jiva to be nondifferent in this verse. Other instances of nondifference should be similarly understood. novaporid brow snt es tomong

IN THE PREVIOUS SECTIONS, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi defined the words brahma, paramātmā and bhagavān. In this section, he substantiates these definitions by citing references from Srimad Bhagavatam. In chapter 2 of the Eleventh Canto, there is a dialogue between Narada and Vasudeva, the father of Kṛṣṇa, when the former visited Dvārakā. Vasudeva inquired about bhāgavata-dharma, or intrinsic relation with the Supreme Whole, also known as bhakti. In reply, Śrī Nārada related the discussion between King Nimi and the Nava Yogendras when they appeared in his sacrificial arena. boyed labo 
In SB 11.3.34, King Nimi inquires about the nature of Nārāyaṇa, Brahman and Paramātmā. In the preceding verse Prabuddha had said that a devotee of Nārāyaṇa can easily transcend material nature, which is most formidable. This inspired King Nimi to ask about Nārāyaṇa and His relation to Brahman and Paramātmā. 
gait the In commenting on this question, Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī says that Nārāyaṇa here should be taken to mean Bhagavan, because it has been used with the other two words, brahma (Brahman) and paramātmā, as the word bhagavan does in SB 1.2.11.gra sd bluoda 
To further support his claim, Śrī Jīva refers to three additional verses from Śrīmad Bhagavatam. These all imply that Nārāyaṇa is 
404 Bhagavan Is Nārāyaṇa 
Bhagavan. SB 11.4.3 refers to Śrī Nārāyaṇa as ādi-deva, or the origi- nal God. Adi-deva is a synonym for Bhagavan, as Śrī Kṛṣṇa says in GĪTĀ 10.2 (aham ādir hi devānām). This verse further shows that Bha- gavān, or Nārāyaṇa, expands as Paramātmā, which conforms to the definition of Paramātmā given in the previous anuccheda. 
The second supporting verse is SB 10.14.14, which was spoken by Brahma in his prayers to Kṛṣṇa. Brahma stole the calves and cowherd boys to test Śrī Kṛṣṇa, but later on realized Bhagavan's super-excellent position and offered prayers to appease Him. 
In this verse, Brahma establishes that Śrī Kṛṣṇa is also Nārāyaṇa, which means that Bhagavan is Nārāyaṇa, because Kṛṣṇa is Bhagavan (kṛṣṇas tu bhagavan svayam, SB 1.3.28). Śrī Brahma also provides an etymological meaning of Nārāyaṇa, by which he explains that Bha- gavān expands as Paramātmā and enters into the unfolded cosmos. 
The third verse quoted in relation to this matter is SB 11.15.16, which was spoken by Kṛṣṇa to Uddhava, who clearly states that Nārā- yana is called Bhagavan. In this way, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī establishes that Nārāyaṇa, mentioned in the core verse of this anuccheda, is Bha- gavān. As such, SB 11.3.34 is a reflection of SB 1.2.11 (vadanti tat, etc.), with which he began Bhagavat Sandarbha.abduva oliw 
Next, Pippalāyana answers King Nimi's question about the nature of Nārāyaṇa, Brahman and Paramātmā in this particular order. He explains the functions of all three features of the Absolute by giving their taṭastha-lakṣaṇa, or extrinsic characteristics. Bha- gavan is the source of creation, maintenance and dissolution, but He Himself is without cause. The Purușa-forms expand from the Supreme Person who is the complete Whole, Bhagavan, and enact the play of creation, maintenance and dissolution. or beffes a

This Bhagavan is called turiya (lit., "the fourth"), because He is free from all limiting adjuncts, or upadhis, which are of three types, as given in a verse quoted in Bhavartha-dipika 11.15.16: moro) 
AT D 
Virat, hiranyagarbha and kāraṇa are the three limiting adjuncts (upadhis) of God in His capacity as the Supreme Immanent, but He who is free from these is called Turiya, the fourth dimension, or in other words, the Supreme Transcendence? 
Virat is the gross upadhi, hiranyagarbha the subtle upadhi, and kāraṇa is māyā (the causal upadhi). These three restrictions apply only to the Purușa manifestations, which are known as Kṣiro- dakaśāyi, Garbhodakaśāyi and Kāraṇodakaśāyī Viṣṇus, respectively. But Bhagavan, replete with six opulences, is beyond these three upādhis. boblotnu si odniesine bus tamens 28 ebnisqxs neving at Alternatively, the meaning of the word turiya is that Bhagavan is the fourth dimension, beyond the states of wakefulness, dream- ing and deep sleep. While commenting on Bhagavatam (SB 2.3.9-10), Śrīdhara Svāmī writes that the Puruşa, or Paramātmā, has prakṛti as a limiting adjunct, but the pūrṇa-puruşa, Bhagavan, is nirupādhi, without any such adjuncts. This upadhi, however, does not make the Puruşa a conditioned being like the living beings in the mate- rial world. It does mean, however, that He does not manifest all the features of Bhagavan. 
The Purusa, which is the same as the Paramātmā feature, is the controller of maya and the living beings. He activates material nature, which is inert. Through the presence of the jiva, who is His part, Bhagavan enlivens the material body and senses. Thus, He is called the hetu-karta, or inspiring agent. When one agent impels another agent to carry out a particular task, then the former is called the causal or inspiring agent and the latter the inspired or instrumental agent.10

al The Paramātmā infuses energy into the living beings, and into their bodies, minds and senses. Thus, Paramātmā is called aṁsi, or the Whole, and the living beings are His amsas, or parts, being inte- gral portions of His energy. Therefore, Śrīdhara Svāmi glosses the word paramātmane (in SB 10.28.6) as the controller, regulator and guide of all living beings, sarva-jiva-niyantre. 
Parama means supreme and ātmā means the self. The Param- ātmā is therefore by definition superior to, and inclusive of, the individual self, and He assists the self by supplying him the requi- site energy and inspiration to work. Thus, in the Vedic scriptures Paramātmā is described as the friend or well-wisher of living beings: 
aliszew ale tera botuesh od blunda 
He attains peace who knows Me as the enjoyer of all sacrifices and austerities, the Supreme Lord of all worlds, and the dear friend of all living beings. (GĪTĀ 5.29)11 
Because Brahman is the unqualified feature of the Absolute Truth, it is very difficult to understand it. In Sections 52-53 of Tattva Sandarbha, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi established that knowledge of the self is essential to the understanding of Brahman. Now, to further clarify Brahman, he first quotes a verse (SB 11.13.27) that describes the self. Kṛṣṇa spoke this verse to Uddhava. The jīva experiences three states-wakefulness, dreaming and deep sleep - but these states are modifications of the faculty of intellect (buddhi) combined with the three gunas of material nature. Wakefulness is the result of buddhi mixed with sattva-guna; dreaming, with rajo-guna; and deep sleep, with tamo-guna.mes on ad bluow early sebwser10 gnidtyns sorThe living being, however, is different from these three states because he is their witness. In the material world, a witness must be different from what is witnessed. This was explained in detail in 
The context is the definition of the uses of the nominative case (kartṛ-kāraka). The subject of a verb is the agent of an action, but in the case of causative verbs, where one impels someone else to perform the action (prayojaka), the subject of the verb is still the agent, but is given the name hetu-karta (the causal or inspiring agent). In such a case, the direct agent or performer of the action is understood as an instrument (prayojya) and is grammatically placed in the instrumental case.b 11 bhoktāram yajña-tapasāṁ sarva-loka-maheśvaram

The jiva remains unchanged in all three states. Indeed, if he underwent any change, he would not be able to perceive these states. Śrī Kṛṣṇa confirms this:

It should be understood that alert wakefulness comes from sattva- guna, sleep with dreaming, from rajo-guna, and deep, dreamless sleep, from tamo-guna. The fourth state of pure consciousness is punchanging and pervades these three. (SB 11.25.20) 13 isd gaivi

sid An objection may be raised that there is no witness in deep sleep, because there is no awareness of anything. But that is not true. In deep sleep the self is aware of not being aware of anything empirical, and that is why on awakening one remembers the pleasurable expe- rience of deep sleep. As stated in the Śruti, "I slept so long and deeply that I had no awareness of anything" (etävantam kālam sukham aham asvapsaṁ na kiñcid avediṣam). Not having any awareness of anything means that a subject is present who perceives the non-awareness of anything. Otherwise, there would be no remembrance of anything, even of sleeping soundly, since no one experiences non-existence, even in deep sleep. There cannot be any recollection without first having experience, but because the mind becomes dissociated from the self in deep sleep, the experience is not very specific. 
Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi further develops this point and says that through this experience of the self as witness, we should try to

understand Brahman, which exists always throughout the three different states of existence as well as in the state of trance. This is called mukta-pragraha-nyāya, or the principle of relieving all con- straints to disclose the fullest meaning. Brahman cannot be realized without the individual being feeling a sense of identity with it. That is one of the reasons for scriptural statements that stress the one- ness of the living being with Brahman, such as tat tvam asi, "You are That (Brahman)." But this does not mean that one becomes Brahman in its original sense. 
On account of its vastness, we cannot see the entire ocean at once; we can only point to a minute portion of it, which we des- ignate as the whole ocean. This is called ekadeśa-nirdeśa-nyāya — designating a part as the whole. Similarly, a jīva cannot realize Brah- man, which is all-pervading and unlimited, in its entirety. So, to con- vey knowledge of it, the individual being is designated as Brahman, even though it is but a fraction thereof. More details will be given about the process of Brahman realization in Anuccheda 6. 
In the next section, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī cites three verses spoken by Śrī Kṛṣṇa to illustrate the three aspects of the Absolute.

BRAHMAN, PARAMĀTMĀ AND BHAGAVAN are also described in the section of Śrīmad Bhagavatam that deals with siddhi, paranormal powers or psycho-spiritual attainments:

the influence of the gunas). 
One who fixes his pure mind on Me in My manifestation as unqualified Brahman obtains the supreme bliss, wherein all desires come to an end (kāmāvasayita). (SB 11.15.15-17)1

bodms adt) odopiv-alal al SH sro1975 ang 997 9 10 IN CHAPTER 15 OF THE ELEVENTH CANTO Śrī Kṛṣṇa explains the var- ious paranormal powers yogis can develop through different medita- tion practices. In the three verses cited here, He explains the process to achieve the siddhis called iśitā, vaśitā and kāmāvasayitā. At the same time, these verses also explain the three aspects of the Abso- lute currently under discussion. The first of the three verses rec- ommends meditating on Paramātmā to attain the paranormal power called iśită. By this accomplishment, a yogi can control the func- tions of material nature and the living beings under her control, śakti-preranam iśită. Because Paramātmā is the controller of mate- rial nature and the conditioned living beings, a yogi attains these powers by meditating on Him. This does not mean, however, that he can create and destroy the cosmos. Brahma-sutra states that lib- erated persons do not have the power to create the cosmos. That can be done only by Bhagavan. 
Paramātmā is called kala-vigraha because He is the personifica- tion of time, which moves and controls everything. As Śrī Kṛṣṇa says in GĪTĀ 11.32, "Time I am" (kalo'smi), and in GĪTĀ 10.30, "Of con- trollers, I am time" (kalaḥ kalayatam aham). Time comes into play when Śrī Viṣņu glances at the unmanifest material nature, prakṛti. This sets everything in motion. Mother Devaki describes time as the movement of His bodily limbs: 
O friend of the unmanifest (prakṛti)! The phenomenon of time, by which the cosmos becomes active, is Your own activity. It is divided into units, from nanoseconds to years, up to periods as long as the lifetime of Brahma, but You are its master and the abode of all auspiciousness. I take shelter of You. (SB 10.3.26)5

5 Absolute Reality Manifests in Three Aspects 
The second of the three verses explains the siddhi called vaśitā. This is the power to remain free from the influence of the gunas of nature, or of the sense objects, even while in their midst, guneṣu asan- gam vaśitā (Viśvanatha). This is attained by meditation on Bhagavan, the Supreme Personal Nondual Being, and the complete Whole. Śrī Nārāyaṇa is called turiya, because He is beyond all upādhis; Bhaga- vān, or Nārāyaṇa, is thus the supreme manifestation of the Absolute Truth. Bhagavan does not directly contact the gunas and thus can never be influenced by them. He has all opulences in their totality. 
The third verse explains the psycho-spiritual perfection called kāmāvasāyitā, which means to attain the supreme bliss whereby one becomes free from all desires. This is a result of meditating on unqualified Brahman. Paramananda (the supreme bliss) in this verse means brahmananda (the bliss of Brahman). This is the state in which one realizes brahma-sayujya, or oneness with Brahman, because in that state one can taste a portion of the bliss of Brah- man. Since there is no variety in Brahman, the Brahman-realized being loses all sense of the duality of enjoyer and enjoyed. He has no desires to fulfill. Since such a yogi does not realize any of the qualities of the Absolute, Brahman lacks the higher completion of Paramātmā and Bhagavan. 
The significance of these three verses is that all three aspects, Nārāyaṇa, Paramātmā and Brahman, are manifestations of one Absolute Reality. Reality manifests in three ways in accordance with different types of worshipers. Because meditation on different aspects of the one Reality yields different accomplishments, their manifestation is not equal in all respects. Bhagavan is superior to the other manifestations because by meditation on Him, one can attain all perfections. As Bhagavan says later in the same chapter: 
For a sage who is constantly fixed in unbroken meditation upon Me, having conquered his senses and mind, regulated the breath and overcome his self-appropriated nature, what perfections could possibly be difficult to achieve? (SB 11.15.32)6

In fact, the devotees of Bhagavan never even desire the vari- ous siddhis and thus demonstrate their superiority to the yogis and other transcendentalists. In the next section, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi will continue his deliberations on the vadanti tat verse.valy) in mop

O Unlimited Lord! You have no attributes (aguna), and so Your glory (mahima) deserves to be perceived by pure-hearted selves. This perception arises from the immutable (avikriyat) experience of, or establishment in, the self (svänubhavät). Being formless (arupataḥ), this glory [Brahman] can be known through aware- ness of non-distinction from it (ananya-bodhyātmatayā) and not bod otherwise. (SB 10.14.6)2

Although Śrī Brahma previously stated in his prayers that Bha- gavan's Brahman and Bhagavan manifestations are both difficult to understand, he nevertheless states here: O Unlimited Lord, O Bhuman (You who are unlimited in form and attributes)! The glory of that aspect in which You do not manifest the attributes existing within Your essential nature (svarupa) is great. This glory, by which is meant Your greatness (bṛhattva), should by extension be understood to mean brahmatva, or the boundless Absolute, for it is said in the Śruti, "Wherefore is this called Brah- man? Because it expands (brmhati) and causes others to expand (bṛmhayati)." This glory of Yours deserves to be perceived by pure-hearted selves, that is, to persons whose inner perceptual faculties have been purified. In other words, the Brahman aspect is potentially revealed to their awareness, i.e., it is possible for this to happen. alb bas anoitaanileup ofasga edi of gaibroos

What is the immediate cause of such perception? To this Brahma says: "It is due to experience of, or establishment in, the self (svanubhavat), that is, through awareness of the pure 'you-prin- ciple' (tvam-padartha, i.e., 'the pure self")."4

subtle bodies. How can the material mind perceive the pure self (tvam-padartha), which is devoid of such transformations? To this, Śrī Brahma answers: "This experience is immutable or free from any transformation (avikriyāt), i.e., the minds of these per- sons are free of all said transformations" [or rather, the experi- ence of self occurs beyond the range of mind, and hence beyond the reach of mental or egoic modifications].

Another objection may be raised that any experience of an object [in the form of mental states, or vṛttis] takes the shape of that object. However, the pure self is not subject to anyone's expe- rience, being situated within or beyond the senses. In answer to this, Brahmāji says, "Being formless (arupataḥ), etc." Form means something that can be measured or conceived (i.e., visaya, "an object of the senses"). The self is devoid of any such shape. In other words, when the mind is free from any modifications caused by attachment to the gross or subtle bodies, then the pure self manifests itself. gr

A final objection is that even if one realizes the infinitesi- mal individual consciousness (tvam-padartha), how can God's Brahman aspect, which is complete, undivided consciousness, become revealed to him? Brahmāji answers, "This glory can be known through awareness of non-distinction from it (ananya- bodhyatmatayā), and not otherwise." In other words, this realiza- tion of non-distinction is possible because Brahman and the jiva share the same characteristic of being conscious by nature. Even if one recognizes that the self is pure consciousness, however, 
535

this does not result in the ability to experience oneness with Brahman by one's own efforts. One can, however, attain it by the power or grace of God who has been worshiped by devo- tion (sadhana-bhakti), which is the source and shelter of all perfections, with the aim of such realization.

Commentarywolonesauto.videolano Juodi Jest singletons Tesorib bas luleringaudaitisa od IN SECTION 4 ŚRILA JIVA GOSVĀMI said that by describing Brahman and Bhagavan, Paramātmā would automatically be explained. He then gave a basic description of these three different manifestations of the Absolute Truth in the subsequent sections. Now he discusses the prerequisites and the process for attaining Brahman realization, for which he cites a verse from Śrī Brahma's prayers to Śrī Kṛṣṇa. 
Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi understands the word mahima (glory) in the verse as meaning Brahman, since mahima means greatness and that is the definition of Brahman given in the Śruti, "Brahman is that which is great, powerful or expansive, and also makes others great, powerful, or expansive (brmhati brmhayati iti brahma)." Because the ātmā is infinitesimal and limited, a mere atomic fraction (anu) of the Supreme, it is very difficult for it to know God's omnipresent Brah- man aspect (vibhu). Indeed, it is impossible unless one takes shelter of unalloyed devotion (bhakti-yoga). Taman Juontiw old 
This Bhāgavatam verse begins with the word tathapi: although it is difficult to know this Brahman aspect of God, it is possible for those whose hearts have been purified. Śrī Brahmāji had previously acknowledged the difficult nature of this conundrum, "Though my mind and senses are controlled and withdrawn from material affairs, I cannot even estimate the potency of this childlike body of Yours, present directly in front of me, what to speak of the happiness You experience within Yourself" (SB 10.14.2)? 
A heart overpowered by the gunas of rajas and tamas does not have the ability to perceive the self due to this state of constant agi- tation. The tamo-guna causes laya-drowsiness, lack of enthusiasm and delusion; while the rajo-guna causes vikṣepa - perturbation due to material attachment, anger, greed and so on. There are many pro- cesses for purifying the heart, but causeless devotion is the most potent and immediate. The real impurity of the heart is the attitude of separateness from, and contraction against, the Supreme Truth and Complete Personal God. God supplies all necessities of life even

without our asking, so if a jiva refuses to acknowledge this, he must be selfish, ungrateful and dishonest. Therefore, unless one at least acknowledges the Supreme Lord, it is not possible to purify the heart completely or to realize any of His three aspects. Śrī Kṛṣṇa confirms this in His teachings to Uddhava:

nsvig s

J6918 279 er One of the revolutionary ideas that Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī is point- ing out to us is that Brahman realization is impossible without the mercy of God, which comes only as a result of the being's partici- pation in devotion. In other words, Brahman realization is impossi- ble without engagement in bhakti-yoga. Thus, even the followers of Śankarācārya, the chief protagonist of brahma-jñāna in recent times, must imbibe the spirit of devotion [which is to say, they must wed devotion to jñāna] to attain perfection in their path. Otherwise, they encounter only misery in the form of repeated birth and death. 
In fact, Brahman, as defined by the Advaitavādīs (Radical Nondualists), is not the same Brahman explained by Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmi. The latter (Brahman), which was also witnessed [and later described] by Śrīla Vyasadeva in his spiritual trance, is the very same Brahman explained in Vedanta-sutra and the Upanisads. The Advaitavadīs, however, manufacture their own idea of Brah- man with the machinery of their mental speculation. Hence, in the Tenth Canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, the gods, headed by Śrī Brahmā, rightly decry such monists:n baeng regne.dnsmilbette lzinstem of from ari zi notiovsh easlseuss Jud Jissd sdt giving 101 292500 shi O lotus-eyed Lord, others [the followers of the path of pure knowl-ro dredge, devoid of devotion] who consider themselves liberated and

ed from the high position they have attained with great difficulty due vil 
to having disregarded Your lotus feet. (SB 10.2.32)" 
In the Third Canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, Śrī Kapiladeva, while explaining the process of aṣṭānga-yoga, which culminates in Brah- man realization, says that the yogi is able to realize Brahman by the strength of his devotion, through meditating on the form of Bhagavan: 
for Śrīg 
By practicing meditation the yogi gradually develops love for 298 Hari. His heart melts due to love and the hairs of his body stand erect due to excessive joy. He is constantly bathed in a stream of tears caused by eagerness. At this stage, the yogi withdraws his mind, no which he used to attract God just as a hook is used to catch fish, from To the object of meditation. to biovsb bred vllest 
Just as the flame of a lamp is extinguished when the oil and wick are exhausted, similarly, the mind becomes situated in Brahman when it is freed from any support [free from the object of meditation or bil from any attachment]. In this state, the jiva becomes free from the reflow of the material gunas [in the form of the body]; the dualism of meditator and meditational object is no more. He sees only one Brah- oman pervading everything, without any deviation. (SB 3.28.34-35)10) 
ilsinam 
Here Kapiladeva explains that the yogi begins meditating on the beautiful form of Bhagavan with the purpose of realizing Brahman. When He actually realizes the form of Bhagavan, he makes the mind void even of this form. Though the outcome is Brahman realiza- tion, this too is due to the mercy of Bhagavan. Therefore, Śrīla

Jiva Gosvāmi says, "One attains Brahman realization only by the influence of God."" (candal deslavom begehalb golved b 
In the first of these two verses from the Third Canto, the pre- fix prati in the word pratilabdha-bhavaḥ signifies that the medita- tor's attainment of bhava is not favorable (prati-küla), since he has a personal motive. Such a yogi is actually inferior. Śrīla Viśvanatha Cakravarti Thakura comments that such a yogi has a very crooked heart. He is like a fisherman who dips in the Ganges only for the purpose of catching fish. His goal is the fish and not the sanctify- ing quality of the Ganges' water. So though he bathes in the Ganges every day, he remains hard-hearted, dry and crooked like the very hook he uses to catch the fish.ald) A sm 
225moges d 
The hook looks appealing to the fish only because of the bait on it, but it is really hard, bent, devoid of any juice, and made only for the purpose of piercing live fish. Therefore, though the heart of the yogi melts, such a transformation is not permanent like the melting of butter, but rather like the softening of a fragment of iron in con- tact with fire. As soon as the heat is removed, the iron becomes solid again.hlebybod 
dry When Śrīdhara Svāmī comments on the phrase projjhita-kaitava (SB 1.1.2), he says that the prefix pra implies that the mere desire for liberation is also an example of a cheating mentality (kaitava). The heart of such a yogi is not completely pure. A pure-hearted person never abandons the lotus feet of Śrī Kṛṣṇa under any circumstances, certainly not due to a preference for His Brahman aspect: 
The person whose heart has been washed clean never abandons eit Kṛṣṇa's lotus feet. Like a traveler who has returned home, he is free from all distress. (SB 2.8.6) 12drianne gan 
According to Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmi, the signs of love apparently manifest in a yogi, as described above (SB 3.28.34), are not real symp- toms of rati, or trans-egoic love; rather, they describe rati-ābhāsa, the mere semblance of such love: 
11

mukta-sarva-parikleśaḥ panthaḥ sva-saraṇam yatha

6 The Person Eligible for Brahman Realization 
If symptoms of rati, such as softening of the heart, are observed in of people who have desires [such as that for liberation] other than devo- tion in love, then these symptoms do not indicate real rati [but only its semblance or shadow]. (BRS 1.3.41)13yelas 
If their devotion were real, Bhagavan would never desert their hearts. He is attracted only by the causeless loving devotion ren- dered by His devotees. Indeed, He is conquered by such pure devo- tion. The processes of Yoga, Sankhya and so on are not powerful enough to captivate Bhagavan. This He revealed to Uddhava: NEVER 
ay My dear Uddhava, the causeless devotion rendered to Me by My 
devotees brings Me under their control. I cannot be thus controlled for by those engaged in Yoga discipline, Sankhya philosophy, pious work, Vedic study, austerity or renunciation. (SB 11.14.20)14

Returning to the main verse being discussed by Śrīla Jivapada in this section, we find Śrī Brahma's statement that the yogi first real- izes the pure self, svanubhavät, and then comes to realize Brahman. 
An objection was raised about Brahman realization in this regard. When we perceive an object with our senses, the process of perception itself produces a change in our mental state (vṛtti)!5 Since the mind is material and is subject to transformation, how can it perceive either the pure self or Brahman, which are free from transformation? Since knowledge of them is beyond the faculties of the mind and senses, it could not possibly arise from any propensity of the heart dependent on mental or sensual faculties that are in a constant state of instability due to the ebb and flow of the material gunas: signteks To

Vedantists propose that when the eye comes in contact with an object, something luminous flows from the eye and envelops the object. This creates a form in the mind called vṛtti, or a mental state. When the self superimposes itself upon, identifies with, or is reflected within that mental state, cognition occurs. There is no perception without the formation of such a mental state, which will then remain until displaced by another dissimilar mental state. mit

Jiva Just as various rivers flow into the ocean, which is ever full and Infimmovable, similarly a person in whom all enjoyments merge with- out causing any disturbance attains peace; but not a person who han- kers after such enjoyments. (GĪTĀ 2.70)16 
Ex 
In reply, Śrī Brahma has used the word avikriyāt, meaning that knowledge of the pure self arises when the mind is free from all vṛt- tis, in other words, when it is in a state of trance. As described above in the verses of Śrī Kapila, the yogi fixes his mind on the form of Bha- gavan, thus freeing his mind from all other engagements (vṛttis). 
To this a further objection was raised. An experience is always related to an object (visaya), but the pure self, being by nature unmanifest, cannot be an object of experience. As Kṛṣṇa says in Bhagavad Gitā: 
It is said that the self is unmanifest, inconceivable and unchange- lable. Knowing this to be so, you should not lament. (GĪTĀ 2.25)17 Anked katsellut of abdonsdihna bildinove. Hoe bag 
201 
In this verse, the word avyakta (unmanifest) indicates that the self is intangible as far as the senses are concerned. This is because the self exists in a non-spatial, non-measurable and non-observable dimension, that yet pervades the body. The senses can experience only those objects that are gross and external. its sim 
In response, Śrī Brahma uses the word arupatah. When the mind is free from the vṛttis generated by attachment to objects related to the subtle and gross bodies, then the self becomes manifest. To per- ceive a material object we need an appropriate sense organ, a mind in its normal state, and favorable conditions. For example, to see a table we need normal eyes, an undisturbed mind and light. If the eye is defective, or if it is dark, then we cannot see the table. But in the case of self-luminous objects, we require only suitable senses and a mind free from disturbances caused by the lower gunas of passion and ignorance.

di For example, to see a light bulb, we do not need a separate source of illumination as was needed in the case of the table. Similarly, to realize the self, no external light or condition is needed, nor is any external sense faculty necessary. It automatically becomes manifest in the pure mind, which is to say that consciousness, or the self, is realized not through the mind but beyond mind. This is also accepted by the Advaitavādīs, as stated by Vidyāraṇya Svāmī in his Pañcadaśī: 
9511 
To see a clay pot kept in darkness, the eye as well as a lamp is neces- sary, but to see a lamp, only the eye is needed. (Pañcadasi 7.93) 18 
Of course, according to Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi, this revelation of the self is completely due to the mercy of Bhagavan. Śrī Kṛṣṇa confirms this in Bhagavad Gitä:

No one can transcend the gunas of material nature without devo- tion. The Advaitavādīs, however, propose that ignorance can be vanquished by the culture of knowledge alone, and that one will attain Brahman realization by dint of this knowledge. However, such knowledge is also a product of material nature, albeit the sattva- guna. Knowledge of one's identity with Brahman can elevate one to sattva-guna. It is only knowledge directly related to the Supreme Lord, however, that is transcendental, and only such knowledge can

My dear Uddhava, the wise do not take to barren literature that doesn't contain descriptions of My activities, such as the creation, maintenance and destruction of the cosmos, or of My appearances in different lilāvatāras, which purify the whole universe. (SB 11.11.20)21 
Later on, He directly states, "Knowledge related to Me is free from the material gunas" (man-nistham nirgunam smṛtam, i.e., "it is transcendental," SB 11.25.24). 
10 
Jiva Gosvāmi foresees yet another objection to what Brahmājī has stated thus far. The pure self, though conscious in nature, is atomic in size. Even if one realizes the self, how does such real- ization encompass the unlimited, omnipresent Brahman? Brahmāji responds with the words, ananya-bodhyatmataya, "Brahman can be known through the awareness of non-distinction from it."22 After realizing the atomic self, the yogi meditates on the self as nondiffer- ent from the indivisible, all-pervading Brahman. During the prac- tice stage, he engages in bhakti while keeping focused on this one- ness of identity. Due to the influence of devotion, the realization of oneness with Brahman, or Brahman realization, finally dawns. Without the influence of bhakti, however, this realization cannot take place. 
It should be noted here that the living being does not become Brahman, nor does he merge in Brahman and lose his identity, any more than a drop does not become the ocean or lose its separate iden- tity when it flows into the ocean. Even before realizing Brahman, the yogi existed in Brahman, but simply did not recognize this truth. Because the aspirant was adamant to attain this realization, he per- formed devotion with that goal in mind. Bhagavan felt moved to ful- fill his desire, although He does not consider this His real blessing, 
21 yasyam na me pavanam anga karma sthity-udbhava-praṇa-nirodham asya lilăvatārepsita-janma va syäd vandhyāṁ giram tām bibhṛyan na dhiraḥ 
22 A drop of the ocean has almost the same qualities as the ocean as a whole. 
Similarly, a spark of fire possesses most of the qualities of fire (heat and light), but only to a very limited extent.

Both the sages who have attained the bliss of Brahman realization and the demons killed by Śrī Kṛṣṇa reside there. (BRS 1.2.280)23 
Jon 290b ad 
Because Brahman is the all-pervading aspect of God, the only way one can realize it is through the perception of non-distinction from, or identity with, it. If one perceives oneself to be distinct from Brah- man, he cannot have full realization of it, because that contradicts доп the very nature of Brahman. Therefore, devotees never hanker after Brahman realization. Rather, they abhor it because radical oneness that fails to admit transcendental distinction, denies the possibility of higher completion, and higher unity, through nondual devotion in love. 
The experience of oneness with Brahman is, however, not within the individual capacity of the practitioner. It occurs by the strength of devotion performed during the stage of practice. In support of this, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī cites two verses from Srimad Bhagavatam. The first (SB 1.2.12) succeeds the vadanti verse that describes the three aspects of the Absolute. This is why the word ātmānam ("the Self" or "the Absolute") can there be taken to indicate Brahman, Paramātmā or Bhagavan, depending upon the qualification of the muni, be he a jñani, yogi or bhakta. All three types of transcenden- talists realize their goal by bhakti and by hearing from authoritative sources, bhaktyä śruta-gṛhitaya. 
While commenting on this verse, Śrīdhara Svāmī writes: 
These three facets of Absolute Reality are attained only through bhakti, along with its attendants, such as jñāna and vairāgya?4 
The import of the verse spoken by Śri Matsyadeva to King Satya- vrata (SB 8.24.38) is twofold. First, Brahman is realized by the mercy 
23 siddha-lokās tu tamasaḥ pāre yatra vasanti hi 
siddha brahma-sukhe magna daityaś ca hariņā hatāḥ 24 tac ca tattvam sa-parikaraya bhaktyaiva präpyate 
63 
gbaxlis Śrī Bhagavat Sandarbha silla 
of Bhagavan, and second, a devotee has automatically attained Brah- man realization without any extraneous endeavor for the culture of brahma-jñāna, just as a person who is situated on the third floor has already passed through the lower floors. But there is a slight differ- ence between the Brahman realization of a devotee and that of a jñānī or yogi. The realization of a devotee is momentary since his real inter- est does not lie there. Even when he realizes Brahman, he does not dissolve his sense of self completely, like a jñānī or yogi, but main- tains the sense of transcendental self, one with, yet distinct from, the Nondual Personal Absolute, and inherently related through the bond of devotional love. This he does, knowing Brahman to be non- different from Bhagavan. In the next section, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi will continue his description of Brahman realization.

The meaning here is as follows: That which is known as Brahman, owing to its being the greatest of the great, is but the pedestal of the Supreme Person, Bhagavan, because the Absolute is first immediately intuited as indeterminate. Since Brahman is Bha- gavan's feature as indeterminate existence, and since the imme- diate apprehension of Bhagavan, who is self-endowed with var- ious wonderful qualities, such as a beautiful form, occurs only after the intuition of Brahman, this Brahman, which is the innate existence of Bhagavan, is thus the basis for the realization of Bhagavān (padam bhagavatah). 
निर्विकल्पब्रह्मणस्तस्य स्वरूपलक्षणमाह प्रतिबोधमात्रमिति अजस्रसुखमिति च । जडस्य दुःखस्य च प्रतियोगितया प्रतीयते यद् वस्तु यच् च नित्यं तदेकरूपं तद्रूपमित्यर्थः । यदात्म- तत्त्वं सर्वेषामात्मनां मूलम् । आत्मा हि स्वप्रकाशरूपतया निरुपाधिपरमप्रेमास्पदतया च तत्तद्रूपेण प्रतीयत इत्यर्थः । 
एकीक 
Śri Brahma then goes on to explain the essential characteristics of indeterminate Brahman with words such as pratibodha-matra (unadulterated consciousness) and ajasra-sukha (uninterrupted joy). That substantive which appears as the absence of matter and sorrow, which is eternal (i.e., “ unchanging"), is Brahman, the ātma-tattva (the root source of all selves). The word ātmā here indicates that Brahman is realized as self-luminous and as the essential ground of untainted supreme love. 
अथ तस्य सुखरूपस्याजस्रत्वे हेतुमाह - शश्वत् प्रशान्तं नित्यमेव क्षोभरहितं तद्वदभयं भयशून्यं विशोकं शोकरहितं चेति । न च सुखरूपत्वे तस्य पुण्यजन्यत्वं स्यादित्याह - शब्दो न यत्रेति । यत्र क्रियार्थो यज्ञाद्यर्थः पुरुकारकवान् शब्दो न प्रवर्तते इत्यर्थः । किन्तु 'औपनिषदं पुरुषम्” (बृ० ३।९।२६ ) इत्यादिरीत्या केवलमुपनिषदेव प्रकाशिका भवति इत्यर्थः ।

How is it that the joy found in Brahman is uninterrupted? Brah- māji says, “Brahman is eternally tranquil” (śaśvat praśāntam), or eternally free from disturbance; similarly, Brahman is free from fear (abhaya) and exempt from grief ( viśoka ). Piety is not

the cause of this joy, as implied by the phrase, "which cannot be realized through the performance of sacrifices or the chanting of Vedic mantras." Sounds or words intoned during the perfor- mance of sacrifice [which generate piety] are ineffective in bring- ing about apprehension of Brahman. Only the Upanisads have the self-illuminating power to disclose Brahman; as is said, "I inquire about that person who is known from the Upanisads."2 
पुनः सुखस्वरूपत्वे चेन्द्रियजन्यत्वं व्यावर्तयति - शुद्धम् इत्यादिना । तत्र शुद्धं दोषरहि- तम् । सममुच्चावचताशून्यम् । सदसतः परं कारणकार्यवर्गादुपरिस्थितम् । 
Any supposition that Brahman's essential joy arises from the senses is rendered inconsistent by use of words like suddha (pure). Pure here means free from defects. Sama (unchanging) means "devoid of any increment or decrement," and sad-asataḥ param means "situated beyond all cause and effect."

What more is there to say? Māyā herself cannot remain before Brahman; out of shame, she flees from those who are favorably disposed to Brahman, the living liberated beings (jivan-muktas), keeping far, far away from them.

IN QUOTING SRI BRAHMA'S STATEMENT, Śrila Jiva Gosvāmi's pur- pose is to show that Brahman realization is the first step in Bhaga- vän realization and to define the characteristics of Brahman in ever 
bt greater depth. tastage olsath 
Amm Brahman is the indeterminate state of Bhagavan, in whom all qualities (visesas) completely and perfectly exist. Before one real- izes the complete and perfect viseṣas in Bhagavan, however, he expe- riences their indeterminate stage called Brahman. As explained in Anuccheda 5, determinate knowledge (savikalpaka-jñāna) is preceded by indeterminate knowledge (nirvikalpaka-jñāna). For instance, when we look at a boy, we perceive three things: his category "boy- hood," which is a quality or adjective for the object perceived, the boy himself (the possessor of boyhood), and the relation between the boy (the object) and his boyhood (the quality). Hence, the statement, "This is a boy," has three elements. 
Knowledge of an object implies that one must first know its qual- ity. To know a blue lotus we must first have knowledge of the color blue. Therefore, knowledge of "boy" must precede the perception of both boy and boyhood, without any knowledge of their relation- ship. This perception of an object and its quality in lieu of any rela- tionship between the two is called indeterminate knowledge. It pre- cedes every determinate perception for a scant moment, occurring somewhere beyond the purview of the senses. 
In Nyaya-siddhanta-muktavali 58, the logician Viśvanatha Tarka- pañcanana has declared, "Indeterminate knowledge is beyond the senses." 
"15 
Knowledge of every object must include its qualifying attributes [except for knowledge of universal category (jati) and knowledge of an inexplicable quality, which is called akhandopadhi]. This princi- ple is known as sākhandopadhi [the invariable co-existence of sub- stance and quality]. In other words, every perceivable object must have some quality. If an object has no quality, it cannot be per-

7 The Manifestation of Brahman 
ceived, since our senses perceive qualities [fragrance, taste, color, texture and sound]. There is no possibility of perceiving an object without quality. Hence, indeterminate knowledge is beyond sense perception. 
Having established this premise, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī says that Brahman, which has no manifest qualities, is the first step towards Bhagavan realization - nirvikalpatayā sākṣātkṛteḥ prathamikatvāt. 
When we look at an electric bulb, we first see light, then the shape of the bulb, and upon closer examination, the filament within. The object, i.e., the bulb, is one, but the stages of perceiving it vary. In the case of ordinary objects, our perception naturally proceeds from indeterminate to determinate. However, in the case of Abso- lute Reality, we need not proceed from stage to stage. If we so desire and are qualified, our perception can remain fixed in the indetermi- nate state, which is called Brahman realization. This entails percep- tion of an object without its attributes, which others may view in conjunction with its qualities. Thus, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī emphatically says that brahma-jñāna is the same as bhagavan-jñāna (brahmanaś ca bhagavata eva). Yet it is an unclear understanding, due to a lack of qualified insight (nirvikalpa-sattva-rupatvät). and Jud som 
Śrīla Viśvanatha Cakravarti Thakura quotes a verse from Siśupala-vadha by the poet Magha to elucidate this point. The verse gives a description of Narada Muni arriving at the Sudharma assem- bly house of the Yadavas in Dvārakā. As Nārada had the mystic power to fly, he approached by way of the sky: 
Śrī Kṛṣṇa first saw him as a bright mass of effulgence. When he came closer, He could understand that it was some being having a body. When he came still closer, He saw a human form. When he landed id in front of them, He finally recognized him as Śrī Nārada. (Śiśupāla- ahovadha 1.3)67 
This verse explains how Śrī Kṛṣṇa's perception changed step by step from seeing a mass of effulgence to seeing Narada Muni. Even when Kṛṣṇa saw him as mass of effulgence at first, it was still

Śri Bhagavat Sandarbha 
Nārada Muni. The object of perception remained one, but the per- ception itself changed with visibility, which improved in proportion to Nārada's proximity.onl senimant gone lag trodi 
Kṛṣṇa's first perception of Narada Muni is akin to Brahman real- ization, the last like Bhagavan realization. Based on His first expe- rience, He could only say that there was something and that it was effulgent. He could not say anything specific about Narada. But when He recognized him as Nārada, He knew him as the son of Brahma, His own devotee, who carries a viņā, the guru of Dhruva and Prahlada, the friend of Tumburu and so on. The first experience is the basis of the last one and is included within it. The first expe- rience is the indeterminate realization of Narada, the final one the determinate experience of the same person. 
Next, Śrī Jiva explains nirvikalpa Brahman as unadulterated con- sciousness and nothing else. There is no distinction herein between the perceiver, what is perceived, or the act of perception, neither is there any admixture of the material gunas. Since material mis- ery is conspicuous by its absence, uninterrupted bliss and eternal peace prevail. Agitation is caused by the gunas of passion and igno- rance, but Brahman is pure transcendence (śuddha), unchanging, and beyond cause and effect; the source of all living beings. Fear is caused by duality, but this is absent in Brahman. d hoy-bqua? 
Brahman is further depicted as ajasra-sukha, full of unlimited joy. The dharma-sastras teach that happiness is an outcome of piety, while misery is caused by sin. The Vedic ritualistic ceremonies and sacrifices are aimed at amassing piety. Knowing this, one may think that happiness in Brahman is the outcome of pious deeds, such as giving in charity. This idea is countered by Brahma's saying, "Sounds intoned for the performance of sacrifice cannot act as agents in this regard, or in other words, in the apprehension of Brahman" (sabdo na yatra puru-kärakavan kriyārthah). Thus, Brahman, the infinite, cannot be attained by the performance of pious deeds, like sacri- fices, since the power of words is finite. With this intent, the Śruti states, "From Brahman speech returns, along with mind, having been unable to ascertain its existence" (yato vaco nivartante apräpya manasă saha). 
70 
707 The Manifestation of Brahman 
HI Sabda (sound) is the quality of the sky, and since Brahman is beyond the sky, sound cannot approach there. Even māyā cannot come near Brahman, what to speak of sound. The sounds of the Upanisads, however, are transcendental, self-manifest and do not depend on the material sky. Thus, it is possible to approach Brahman through the sounds of the Vedas dealing with the Absolute, but not through material sound or the ritualistic parts of the Vedas meant for elevation to heavenly planets. anseM er al modoved 
Bhagavan is pure, beyond māyā, just like Brahman. He is the Sup- reme Controller; there is no fear or distress in Him. These qualities are perceived in Bhagavan, but not in Brahman, because there is no relationship between the object, Brahman, and its qualities. Brah- man is defined as unadulterated consciousness and uninterrupted joy. Śrī Jīva glosses that these two characteristics are perceived as the absence of inertness and suffering respectively. In other words, Brahman is experienced as the negation of material characteristics, such as inertness, misery, agitation, fear and grief. The experience is akin to deep sleep. Thus, Brahman realization is incomplete, since this lack of relationship cannot be clearly explained, being in the category of indeterminate knowledge. 
Śrila Jiva Gosvāmi concludes by saying that if Bhagavan is rightly understood, one will know Brahman in the proper perspective. In fact, one cannot come to a thorough understanding of Brahman without understanding Bhagavan, inasmuch as one cannot under- stand sunlight without the sun. Therefore, Jiva Gosvāmī did not compile a separate treatise on Brahman. Although Brahman is the subject of hundreds of books by monists and other scholars in Vedanta, actually no independent analysis is required. Hence, these few paragraphs, which conclude with this verse, can be called Brahma Sandarbha, but they are in fact but a small portion of Bha- gavat Sandarbha. Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī analyses bhagavat-tattva from this perspective. 
In the next anuccheda, Śrī Jiva will identify the qualifications needed for realizing Bhagavan.com image d

His energies, abode and pastimes, after first realizing them in the intense absorption of spiritual trance, and to then describe the same for the benefit of humanity. Subsequently, Vyasa's trance revealed the original Complete Person along with all His potencies. 
In this verse, bhakti-yogena, the application of devotion in love, is the sine qua non, since bhakti is expedient in the process of realiz- ing the Supreme Person, Bhagavan. Bhakti as it is used here refers to pure devotion, not the bhakti whereby one realizes Brahman, as was described in Anuccheda 7. This bhakti is amala, without a tinge of impurity, i.e., the practitioner possesses no material motives. It is devotion in love of God.

THE SAME IDEA was stated by Śri Brahma in the following way: 
त्वं भक्तियोगपरिभावितहृत्सरोज आस्से श्रुतेक्षितपथो ननु नाथ पुंसाम् । यद्यद्धिया त उरुगाय विभावयन्ति तत्तद्वपुः प्रणयसे सदनुग्रहाय ॥ २७ ॥ इति ॥ श्रीसूतः ॥ 
O Master! You take Your seat in the lotus heart that has been made worthy of You through love, prema. Even so, the way to reach You can be understood through hearing. Out of kindness toward your devotees, O Lord, who are greatly glorified, You take the very form that they meditate on, appearing to them in that The form. (SB 3.9.11)1y buen geplanted 
Commentary 
TO FURTHER SUPPORT THIS CONTENTION, Śrī Jiva Prabhu cites one of Śrī Brahma's prayers to Śrī Viṣṇu for creative energy. Brahma describes bhakti as an antecedent to the revelation of Bhagavan. Sadhana-bhakti, or devotion in practice, begins with hearing about Bhagavan. This hearing cleanses the heart of material desires. When

9 Bhagavan Manifests According to the Mood of the Devotee 
the heart is clean, sadhana-bhakti matures into bhava-bhakti, or devo- tion as the permanent foundation of feeling-awareness rooted in personal God, which gradually ripens into the fruit of prema-bhakti, or devotion as all-consuming ecstatic love for God. By the power of prema-bhakti, Bhagavan appears to each devotee in the form the devotee desires. Raqqa navegada araw trobbutt nadesh of go 
Bhagavan is completely independent (svarāt), but by His own sweet will, He is controlled by loving devotion. Bhagavan reveals this secret to Durvāsā Muni: 
As chaste women bring their gentle husbands under control by service, pure devotees, who are equal to everyone and completely bound to Me in the core of the heart, bring Me under their full control. (SB 9.4.66)2 
And again He says the same in His categorical statement to Uddhava, removing any notion that there could possibly be another means to please Him: 
I, who am the Supreme Immanent Self (Paramātmā) and the most beloved of all (priya), am attainable for those established in truth (satām) only through unalloyed devotion undertaken with full faith. Moreover, bhakti performed with exclusive fixity upon Me purifies even the outcaste dog-eaters. (SB 11.14.21)3 
Bhagavan appears as the most attractive object of His devotee's meditation. This does not mean, however, that He is obliged to appear in any form the devotee imagines. The devotee meditates on His form as it is depicted in scriptures and explained by realized beings. This is the significance of the phrase śrutekṣita-pathah (seen through the ear).

the devotees are purified simply by hearing about You (śruteksita- pathah); thus, they easily overcome the cycle of birth and death. Not only are they liberated from the material world, but they can then bring God under their control, as a result of which He takes His seat in their purified hearts. In the next section, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi goes on to describe an incident where Bhagavan appeared to Brahmāji after he had engaged in loving devotion.

Śri Bhagavan, being highly satisfied with the penance of Brahma, was pleased to reveal to him His personal abode [Vaikuntha], the supreme planet above all others. This transcendental abode of Bhagavan is free from all kinds of affliction, delusion and fear. It is adored by self-realized beings. (SB 2.9.9) 201

from the navel of the Purusa named Nārāyaṇa. Pleased with his penances and subjugated by his adoration, Śrī Bhagavān bestowed upon Brahma a complete vision of Vaikuntha, upper- most among all the worlds. 
यद् यतो वैकुण्ठात् परमन्यद् वैकुण्ठं परं श्रेष्ठं न विद्यते परमभगवद्वैकुण्ठत्वात् । यद् वा यद् यतो वैकुण्ठात् परं ब्रह्माख्यं तत्त्वं परं भिन्नं न भवति । स्वरूपशक्तिविशेषाविष्कारेण माययानावृतं तदेव तद्रूपमित्यर्थः । अग्रे त्विदं व्यक्तीकरिष्यते । slamsx. mA 
The phrase paraṁ na yat-param (the supreme planet above all oth- ers) means, "There is no other Vaikuntha superior to that Vai- kuntha, because it is the Vaikuntha of the Supreme Bhagavan." Or, alternatively, "That which is known as the Supreme Brahman is not different (param) from Vaikuntha."3 In other words, that supreme abode is a distinct manifestation of Bhagavan's internal potency (svarupa-śakti) [which concerns the interiority of non- dual being], and free from any covering of māyā; as such, it is His very own form. This will be made evident further on.

The five types of affliction (sarkleśa) are ignorance (avidya), ego- tism (asmită), desire or attachment (rāga), aversion, (dvesa) and tenacity of bodily consciousness (abhiniveśa).

IN THE PREVIOUS SECTION, Śri Jiva quoted Śri Brahma saying that Bhagavan appears in the heart of a devotee who is purified by bhakti- yoga. Now he quotes ten and a half verses from Srimad Bhagavatam that give Śrīla Sukadeva Gosvāmi's description of Bhagavan's reve- lation to Brahmājī. His intention is to give a practical example of Bhagavan realization after explaining the process and prerequisites for it.onthegadgir milyen toonaly zamdené sadur.com 
He begins by demonstrating how Vaikuntha is transcendental and cites various evidences to show that māyā has no influence there. The Supreme Lord and other inhabitants of Vaikuntha live there enstatically, or "standing within the self," as their bodies, minds, senses, actions and even the place are nothing other than

being-consciousness-bliss. The residents there are eternally free from material misery and continuously serve Bhagavan in the spon- taneous play of loving devotion. (ild honey-rela bila basso ale Vaikuntha is a manifestation of visuddha-sattva, pure being com- prised of Bhagavan's internal potency. These ten and a half verses offer a description of Bhagavan's abode, the residents of Vaikuntha, Lakṣmi Devi (Bhagavan's eternal consort), the actions of the resi- dents and the loving dealings between Bhagavan and His devotees. 
Brahma's experience was not a dream or hallucination. The last two verses describe his direct meeting with Bhagavan, shaking of hands, and the conversation that ensued. Bhagavan bestowed this vision of Vaikuntha upon Brahma, as if seeking to help him ward off any pride that might overtake him while engaged in architectural design of the material world. 
por Chapter 9 of the Second Canto describes how Śrī Brahma awoke fully conscious after being born in the lotus growing from Śrī Nārā- yana's navel. At that time, Śrī Viṣṇu was lying on the Garbhodaka Ocean beyond Brahma's vision; the universe was as yet vacant. While deliberating on how to create the universe, Brahma twice heard a voice say, tapa (perform penance). Following this order, he controlled his mind and senses for a thousand celestial years. Pleased that Brahma had complied with His command, Śrī Bhaga- vän blessed him with a vision of Himself in Vaikuntha. 
The words paraṁ na yat-param in SB 2.9.9 indicate that the world seen by Brahma is the topmost realm in all existence, both finite and infinite. This implies that Vaikuntha is beyond the material cos- mos, where Brahma's planet of Satyaloka is the highest. There are many Vaikunthas belonging to various personal manifestations of Bhagavan, such as Rama. Śrī Jiva comments here that the Vaikun- tha that Brahma saw was the highest among Vaikunthas, because it was the Vaikuntha of the Supreme Bhagavan, "There is no other Vaikuntha superior to that Vaikuntha, because it is the Vaikuntha of the Supreme Bhagavan." Later on, while commenting on the four seed verses of Bhagavatam, which were spoken by Bhagavan to Brahma after showing him His abode, Śrī Jiva Gosvāmī argues that these verses were spoken by Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the original complete form

Vaikuntha is free from the five afflictions (vyapeta-sarkleśa), namely, ignorance (avidya), egotism (asmită), attachment (rāga), hatred (dveṣa) and bodily consciousness (abhiniveśa). Misery sprouts and fructifies in the soil of tamas, the darkness of ignorance, or avidya. Since avidya is absent in Vaikuntha, so are all forms of suffering. Maharși Patanjali defines avidya: 
rovab sigos 
To consider the impermanent to be eternal, the impure as pure, the painful as blissful, and the inert as conscious, is called avidya. (Yoga- sutra 2.5)8 
9 dilide ain, gol grisd 
of two The material world and everything within it, including the mind and body, is temporary. To consider it to be permanent is the begin- ning of avidya. Everyone knows that the body becomes old and dies, sometimes even without becoming old. Yet people still make plans to enjoy this body as if it were immortal - or they foolishly even try to make the body eternal! According to Mahārāja Yudhisthira, there is nothing more amazing than this: 
OH 
Everyday people die, thus attaining the abode of Yamarāja (lord of death). Yet those who remain here wish to live forever. What could 
be more amazing than this? (MB 3.313.116) on mi enoidsuriolanet tud gridion 
zib has zasniq 
Though the body is full of impurities, such as stool, urine, blood, mucus and so on, out of avidya people consider the body as lovable, thus do they search out some enjoyment therein. If one touches the aforementioned substances, one must bathe to purify oneself. Simi- larly, irreligious acts, like theft and violence, are impure; to perform them as a means of livelihood demonstrates gross avidyā. 
The material body is a reservoir of misery. The amount of pain arising from any part of it is incalculable. Śrī Kṛṣṇa Himself stated that this body is a reservoir of suffering (duḥkhalaya, GITA 8.15) and 
anityāśuci-duḥkhānātmasu nitya-suci-sukhātma-khyātir avidya

Śrī Bhagavat Sandarbha apr 
devoid of happiness (asukha, GITA 9.33). Even so, people mistakenly take this body as an instrument of pleasure.gomong 
The fourth type of avidya is to consider the inert body, senses and mind as conscious. An ignorant person cannot distinguish the conscious self from the inert mind, body and senses (vimūḍhā nānu- pasyanti, GĪTĀ 15.10). People in the bodily concept of life have no idea that the self is distinct from the gross and subtle material bodies.qa do These are the four types of avidya, and a person affected by them is comparable to an unknowing animal, as stated in Hitopa- deśa, "People devoid of transcendental knowledge are no better than animals." As Sankarācārya sings (Moha-mudgara 21), they must repeatedly undergo birth, death, old age and disease."1 
Owing to avidya, the living being loses his ability to discrimi- nate between the self and the inert mind (citta). This gives rise to the next affliction called asmită [the phenomenal "I"-sense], which is defined in Yoga-sutra as "equating the seer (drk-sakti) with the instrument for seeing [darśana-sakti, i.e., citta or the mind] as one and the same."12 The living being perceives material objects through citta-vṛtti, mental states that result when the senses come in contact with sense objects. Citta-vṛtti is thus instrumental (karana), but it is not the perceiver; the self is the perceiver. However, out of avidya, the living being considers the citta, i.e., the instrument for seeing, as himself and the citta-vṛtti as a transformation in himself. Feelings of happiness and distress are nothing but transformations in the citta, as Śrī Kṛṣṇa says:a anda 
d, bitece 
The five great elements, egoism, the intellect, the unmanifest, the ten senses, the mind, the five sense objects, desire, aversion, hap- piness, distress, the body, consciousness and patience -- these are, in brief, the field of activities along with their interactions. (GĪTĀ 13.5-6)13

10 An Example of Bhagavan Realization 
A conditioned being identifies with these mental states and thus considers himself as happy or miserable. This misidentification is a hṛdaya-granthi, a knot in the heart, cut only when one realizes Bhagavan within and without. Śrī Sūta Gosvāmi therefore says:elb 
of botelor ozarb bie opor to 
Thus, the knot in the heart is pierced, and all misgivings are cut to pieces. The chain of fruitive actions is terminated when one sees the Self as master. (SB 1.2.21)14 
In Vaikuntha, the residents do not experience this knot within the heart, because they are fully realized. 
The natural sequels to asmită are raga and dveṣa, attachment and aversion. By experiencing happiness, attachment (raga) for the enjoyment of sense objects arises, and by suffering misery, aver- sion (dveşa) arises (sukhānuśayī rāgaḥ duḥkhānuśayi dveśaḥ, Yoga- sūtra 2.7-8). As a result of asmită within the mind, body and senses, the living being develops the sense of "I and mine." When he experi- ences objects or activities that are pleasurable, certain impressions are created within the heart that urge him on to other sense objects. This desire, or attachment, is called rāga, which further gives rise to greed. Similarly, miserable experiences leave their own impres- sions, and the desire to avoid them is called dveṣa, which further gives rise to anger and fear. Śrī Kṛṣṇa says, therefore, that one should not become controlled by raga and dveṣa: 
Attachment and aversion are in all sense objects. One should not come under their sway, for they are impediments. (GĪTĀ 3.34)15 
Attachment and aversion actually reside in the heart of the per- son, not in the sense objects. One's attachment and aversion, how- ever, become rooted in the sense objects, and thus, Bhagavan says that attachment and aversion are in them. Otherwise, a particular

sense object would either attract or repulse everyone, but this is never the case. When devotees hear someone singing a song about God, they feel attracted, but non-devotees may experience it as a disturbance.dava 6103 
Because of raga and dveșa related to material objects, one is naturally entangled in the bodily concept of life. This results in constant attempts to protect the body from destruction, plus the constant fear of death. This is called abhiniveśa, which is the "fear of death, found even amongst the learned" (svarasa-vähi viduşo'pi tathāruḍho'bhiniveṣaḥ, Yoga-sutra 2.9). Impressions of the fear of death are carried from previous lives; thus even animals are equipped with the survival instinct. 
Use of the word viduṣaḥ (learned) in the above sutra refers to those who have scholarship only, without realization. A self- realized being does not fear death, since he is free from the bodily concept of life (vita-rāga-bhaya-krodhaḥ sthita-dhir munir ucyate, GĪTĀ 2.56). 
Self-realized beings glorify the abode of Bhagavan, Vaikun- tha, because it is free from distress. In this connection, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī cites the example of the Kumāras cursing the gatekeepers of Vaikuntha. Later, after the Kumāras realized the opulence of Vai- kuntha and the exalted position of the residents there, they recited prayers in their glorification in the two verses quoted at the end of the above subsection (SB 3.16.18).

As we shall duly establish further on," this quality of being is known as śuddha-sattva (pure being); it is conscious by nature and a function of the internal potency of Bhagavan, completely beyond māyā. All this will be established later on in the appropri- ate place. The import is that only this purely spiritual quality of being (śuddha-sattva) prevails there in Vaikuntha.

Had The gunas exist everywhere in a state of mutual intercourse, thus Bardo they move everywhere together. The companion of rajas is sat- brtva; the companion of sattva is rajas; the companions of tamas are Tosattva and rajas; and the companion of these two is tamas. It is not possible to trace out which amongst them existed first, when they first mixed together or when they will be separated.22

Therefore, since rajo-guna is not present in Vaikuntha, Vaikun- tha is never created, and since tamo-guna is also absent, it is never destroyed. As material sattva is also non-existent, it is demon- strated that the nature of Vaikuntha is eternal existence, con- sciousness and bliss. The reason for this is given, "Nor is there any influence of time" (na ca kala vikramaḥ). It is the influence of time that destabilizes primordial nature from its equilibrated state,23 giving rise to these separate functions of the gunas. Since the six types of transformation24 are also caused by time, these are also quite naturally absent from Vaikuntha.road BA is and ti son abto radio al.(to asqz of Jadw) otu किं च तेषां मूलत एव कुठार इत्याह “न यत्र माया” इति । मायात्र जगत्सृष्ट्यादिहेतुर्भगव- च्छक्तिर्न तु कापट्यमात्रं रजादिनिषेधेनैव तद्व्युदासात् ।

Prakṛti is the unmanifest state of matter, and its constituents are the three gunas, called sattva (luminosity), rajas (dynamism) and tamas (inertia). The whole of material creation is a modification of prakṛti, catalyzed by the influence of time. In prakṛti, the three gunas persist in a state of static equilibrium. This is the state of dissolution. The three gunas are found in all material objects and actions. The word guna also means "attribute," but when used for sattva, rajas and tamas, it means the constituents of prakṛti. fstatomedina Tabe

found there" (na yatra māyā). Here the word māyā refers to Bha- gavan's potency that is the cause of cosmic creation, maintenance and dissolution, and not simply to its meaning as "deceit." Since the gunas of rajas and tamas are absent there, the possibility of deceit there has already been excluded.

To explain it another way, since rajas and tamas are absent in Vaikuntha, material sattva, always in relationship with them, is also absent. Use of the word misra (admixture) indicates that the three gunas are not existing there in the homogenous state known as pradhana.25 Since there is nothing to regulate, the con- trolling agencies of time and maya are also absent. The difference between pradhana and māyā will be examined later on.2

All the aforementioned points are underlined with the words kim uta (what to speak of). In other words, since it has already been established that in Vaikuntha no rajas or tamas is present, to say that there is no sattva mixed with a little bit of rajas or tamas is like grinding flour. [Flour has already been ground so what is the necessity of grinding it again?]

The second verse in this series from the Second Canto (SB 2.9.10) explicitly establishes that Vaikuntha is free from the three gunas of material nature. The gunas and their source, māyā, are both absent 
25 The state of static equilibrium; the original germ from which the material Job universe evolves; the subtle, undifferentiated sum total of all material elements; the condition of material nature immediately previous to its manifestation is called pradhana. 26 In Section 22.

in Vaikuntha, and thus time has no influence there. Time influences material nature, and thus all material objects undergo some or all of the following transformations: coming into being (jayate), sub- sisting for some time (asti), increasing (vardhate), changing (par- inamate), dwindling (apakṣiyate) and finally annihilation (nasyati)?" At the beginning of creation, the gunas are in an equilibrated state (pradhana), but time destabilizes them and various transformations result. In Vaikuntha, however, pradhana is absent; hence, there is no creation or destruction. Everything is sat, cit and ananda. 
Additionally, Viśva-prakāsā dictionary defines māyā as cheat- ing-māyā dambhe kṛpäyäṁ ca. However, in this verse [SB 2.9.10], māyā refers to the material energy. When it is stated that rajas and tamas are absent in Vaikuntha, it naturally follows that there is no deceit. If māyā referred only to duplicity, then it would be redun- dant to say there is no māyā, since the absence of rajas and tamas naturally means absence of māyā, or deceit. 
When it is said that Vaikuntha is a manifestation of pure sattva (viśuddha-sattva), it should not be mistaken to mean mundane sattva, free from rajas and tamas. Since the gunas of nature always coalesce, unmixed sattva cannot be found. As Kṛṣṇa says in Bhagavad Gita: 
that There is no state of being (sattva), whether on earth or even amongst the gods in heaven, that is free from the three gunas born of material nature. (GĪTĀ 18.40)28 just tha

When it is said, for instance, that cow's milk is in sattva-guna, it means that sattva-guna is predominant. Moreover, this is a relative statement. If one consumes more milk than he is able to digest or drinks stale milk, the result will be rajasic or tāmasic. None of the gunas are found in a pure state anywhere in the material world. Śrī Brahma therefore tells Nārada:

It is not possible to find only sattva or only rajas or only tamas any- where. They are always mixed with each other and thus they are said dto be mutually dependent. (Devi-bhāgavata Purana 3.8.14)29al bifo 
(stadthe) 
Since the material gunas are inert, even if it is assumed that Vai- kuntha is comprised of an unmixed, mundane sattva-guna, with- out any tinge of rajas or tamas, this would contradict the scrip- tural injunctions which state that Vaikuntha is conscious and self-luminous as is Bhagavan. If Vaikuntha were constituted of inert matter, self-realized beings who have transcended sattva- guna would not take any interest in its glorification, as was stated in the previous verse, "It is adored by self-realized beings" (sva- drstavadbhir vibudhair abhiṣṭutah). Thus, the monistic theory that the Vaikuntha planets are a manifestation of mundane sattva is untenable. 
The words "worshipable by both devas and asuras" (sura-asura- arcitāḥ) imply that devotees are beyond those in sattva-guna (gods or the devas) and beyond those in the gunas of rajas and tamas (those antithetical to the gods or the asuras).

So my Lord, O supreme friend of the self, although You playfully as accept the gunas of sattva, rajas and tamas for the sake of creat- ing, maintaining and annihilating this world, it is Your pastimes in sattva that bring liberation to the conditioned beings, and not hen the other two [rajas and tamas], which simply lead them into Vmisfortune, bewilderment and fear. 
Therefore, O Lord, the wise, being situated in pure sattva, thus worship Your beloved transcendental form, composed of pure sattva, along with the spiritual forms of Your pure devotees. Because the kingdom of God, fearlessness and spiritual joy are (8 vanall accessible through pure sattva, Your devotees consider it, and not the other, to be a direct manifestation of You, the Purușa.

It is not just that these other, lower gunas simply lack peace, they yield undesirable effects. This is indicated by the words vyasana-moha-bhiyah (misfortune, bewilderment and msique fear)."

The state of unalloyed being, viśuddha-sattva, is called vasudeva because the Personal God is unveiled therein. (SB 4.3.23)31

Material sattva (prākṛta-sattva) is the means or cause for bring- ing what was unperceived within the range of perception (ago- carasya gocaratve hetuḥ). By the same token, pure sattva (śuddha- sattva) is a particular function (vṛtti) of the internal potency (cit-śakti) that allows us to perceive the otherwise imperceptible, supramundane sphere. It is on this point that we find consis- tency in the definition of the term sattva as it is used both for the material and transcendental realms, awon glaons yousing lartsinl

Therefore, by here using the words abhayam atma-sukham (fear- lessness and spiritual joy), it is also pointed out that this sattva, as a disposition of Bhagavan's internal potency, is the very self of His being (svarupātmatā). And because in this instance the emphasis is placed on the potency [and not on the Potent Source], Märkandeya Rṣi says "the kingdom of God," i.e., Vaikuntha, man- ifests from the internal potency known as viśuddha-sattva.

The words na ca anyat (and not the other) in SB 12.8.46 refer to material sattva. Interpreting the singular case pronoun anyat to mean both rajas and tamas would assume that the use of the pro- noun in the singular could refer to a plurality, namely, rajas and tamas. If anyat, which is the singular form of the pronoun, were to be taken to refer to both rajas and tamas, that would be over- extending the interpretation.33 In the fourth line of the previous verse (i.e., SB 12.8.45), rajas and tamas were already referred to by the dual case form of the same pronoun anye (the other two).34 In conclusion, therefore, there is another sattva, distinct from the commonly known material sattva, which belongs to Bhagavan's internal potency.

Śrīdhara Svāmi confirms this understanding in his commen- taries to SB 11.4.435 and SB 5.7.14. In the former, he glosses the phrase jñānam svataḥ (knowledge comes directly from Him) as, "The knowledge available to embodied beings comes from the sattva arising from Bhagavan's internal potency (svarupa)." In the latter, while commenting on the mantra chanted by Jaḍa Bharata, he glosses the words paro-rajah (beyond rajo-guna) in reference to Bhagavan's effulgence, as meaning "beyond all the qualities of material nature," i.e., consisting of the quality of pure abrow.adsrom og op

The meaning of this verse is as follows. The word dhama (efful- gence) refers to the illuminating potency existing in Bhagavan's essential nature. The state of pure being (viśuddha-sattva) is modified by two adjectival phrases, "devoid of rajas and tamas" (dhvasta-rajas-tamaska), and "radiant with consciousness" (tapo- maya). The word tapas (the penance of meditative force) here means "consciousness," as indicated by the statement in TU 2.6.1 [and TU 3.1.1], "He undertook the penance of meditation."43 Thus, tapo-maya means abounding in consciousness, without any tinge of inertness. As such, it is similar in meaning to the statement, "The self is pure and abounding in consciousness" (SB 10.47.31). For this reason, any possibility that material sattva exists in Bha- gavān is invalidated. Therefore, "In You the mighty flow of the gunas of material nature, made of māyā, does not exist. Only due to ignorance do You appear to be involved in the entanglements of material nature."

O Lord, You accept a transcendental (viśuddha-sattva) body in the course of sustaining the embodied beings; it is the resting place of the highest good, for by it they can worship You through chanting the Vedas, performing ritualistic ceremonies, yoga, penances and ultimately ecstatic absorption in awareness of You. 
O Maintainer, if Your body was not of this transcendental nature (viśuddha-sattva), no one could attain the transcendental knowl- edge revealed by You, which dispels ignorance and duality.

(viśuddha). This means that its purity is categorically distinct from material sattva, which cannot be pure even if free from all tinges of rajas and tamas, because material sattva is necessarily constituted of a portion of inertness ( jādya). This sattva, how- ever, being part of Your svarupa-sakti and a part of Your very Self, cannot be tinged by material gunas and is therefore absolutely 
pure.

Why are You impelled to manifest a body? You do so "in the course of sustaining the embodied beings" (sarīriņām sthitau). This means that your primary purpose in manifesting Your form is to bestow the bliss of devotion everywhere, so that those within the manifest cosmos may fix their minds on Your lotus feet. As Śrī- mati Kuntidevi says, "You appear to distribute Your devotional service” (bhakti-yoga-vidhānārtham, SB 1.8.20).

What is the nature of Your body? It is "the ultimate resting place of the highest good" (śreya-upāyana), that is, of all the goals of human life. In other words, it is supremely and eternally bliss- ful. The purport is that the difference between You and Your body is only figurative. Therefore, people take support of this form to worship You (tavārhana). Through which practices? By means of the Vedas and other such methods that derive their support from You. These means, although offered to You, will for the most part, however, be unsuccessful if Your form is neglected.

Śrī Brahma and the devas further clarify that viśuddha-sattva is identical to Kṛṣṇa's essential nature, since it is the agency through which Bhagavan's form becomes manifest. They say [in the second verse under discussion, i.e., SB 10.2.35], "O Maintainer (dhātaḥ)! If this sattva, which is the direct realization or experi- ence, of You, which is in fact identical with that realization, and which is, therefore, Your own power of self-luminosity and self- revelation, did not exist, then through material sattva, one could gain only indeterminate realization of Your self-manifestation.46 Complete Truth would not be achieved. At the farthest reach, only knowledge of what is within the world may be attained; but not even an atom of understanding of You."

In answer, Śri Brahma and the devas say, "Your existence can only be inferred (anumiyate) through the light of material sattva-guna (guna-prakāśaiḥ)." In other words, direct perception of You can- not be attained through material sattva. Or, to explain it another way, without the appearance of Your suddha-sattva, which com- pletely vanquishes and drives away tamas, Your existence can only be guessed at through the light of material sattva. However, in the presence of Your pure sattva, one certainly achieves direct experience of You. 
46 In the absence of suddha-sattva, what remains is only material sattva (idam 
sattvam), which indeed does dispel tamas to some extent, but nevertheless falls far short of the mark in providing direct perception of You. Material sattva can only prepare the path, providing some indeterminate, generalized conception of You through inference (anumana), minus direct experience (anubhava).This

To clarify further, the gods specify two kinds of inference, "[The quality that illuminates] belongs to You (yasya gunaḥ prakāśate)," and secondly, "It is through You that it illuminates (yena gunah prakāśate).” That is, firstly, even though the material gunas do not occur within Your internal potency, they still have a permanent relationship with You [this relation is shown by the use of the gen- itive case, yasya], or, secondly, their existence is brought to light solely by You (yena), and in this way they are Your indicators. An example of the former is the dawn, indicating that sun-rise is near, and of the second, smoke, indicating the presence of fire. So it is correct to say that material sattva, through these methods of inference, is not the ideal means of attaining direct realization of You.

HOWT 
Thus, it is established that the non-material sattva is Your own self-revealing potency, by which You, the self-luminous Lord, are directly realized. Those who propose that viśuddha-sattva is nothing more than material sattva devoid of rajas and tamas, and that Bhagavān's form, abode, etc., are products thereof, do not find support from anyone. This is because material sattva- guna, in the absence of connection with rajo-guna, would be of the nature of self-existent tranquility and hence the cause of utter indifference to exertion since in that case there would be no possibility of its being impelled to act. Furthermore, material sattva, being of the nature of phenomenal knowledge, is consti- tuted in such a way that it can reveal only those objects that are

It was thus said earlier that the material quality of sattva is the means or cause for bringing what was unperceived within the range of perception (agocarasya gocaratve hetuḥ);47 rajas causes the perception of difference in what is perceived, whereas tamas causes the various features of an object to be withdrawn. Simi- larly, sattva is the cause of mutual objectivity, rajas prepares the way for mutual benefit, and tamas, for mutual maliciousness. The three kinds of perception can be correlated to maintenance, cre- ation and dissolution, respectively, as well as to objectivity, wel- fare and maliciousness. [These are respectively the products of the material gunas of sattva, rajas and tamas.] 
अथ रजोलेशे तत्र मन्तव्ये विशुद्धपदवैयर्थ्यमित्यलं तन्मतरजोघटप्रघट्टनयेति । 
Now, if even a particle of rajas is admitted in sattva, then the adjec- tive viśuddha (pure), placed before it [in SB 10.2.34, the first of the two verses under discussion], is rendered meaningless. So let us refrain from refuting further the contrary view that viśuddha- sattva is nothing but material sattva devoid of rajas.

192901 201 Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi here cites many verses from different scriptures as evidence that Vaikuntha and the form of Bhagavan are viśuddha- sattva, part of His internal potency. Śrī Bhagavan and His abode have nothing to do with material sattva-guna, which is a feature of the external potency. Thus, Jiva Gosvāmī uproots the impersonalists' theory that ultimate reality is unqualified Brahman, and that when 
evaṁ prākṛta-rūpāya vibhūter rūpam uttamaṁ tripad-vibhuti-rupam tu śṛnu bhudhara-nandini pradhana-parama-vyomnor antare virajā nadi vedänga-sveda-janita-toyaiḥ prasravitā śubhā tasyäḥ pāre para-vyomni tripäd-bhūtaṁ sanātanam amṛtam śāśvatam nityam anantam param padam suddha-sattva-mayam divyam akṣaram brahmanah padam

Brahman combines with the knowledge potency of māyā (sattva- guna), the Vaikuntha planets and various forms of Bhagavan become manifest.50 This is tantamount to saying that Vaikuntha and Bhaga- van's forms are material. This theory cannot be sustained in view of the verses (quoted in this passage) that clearly explain that Bhaga- van is beyond the material gunas, and that those who worship Him also become free from material nature (VP 1.9.43; GĪTĀ 14.26). 
The reason that material sattva and transcendental sattva (viśuddha-sattva) have the same name is because of their common functions. Material sattva is instrumental in acquiring knowledge and an understanding of material objects. Śrī Kṛṣṇa says, "From sattva-guna knowledge arises" (sattvät sañjāyate jņānam, GĪTĀ 14.17). Similarly, transcendental sattva is instrumental in the direct real- ization of transcendental substance. Just as sattva is a manifestation of the material energy (māyā), viśuddha-sattva is a unique manifes- tation of the internal conscious potency (cit-śakti).hid of t 
Material sattva cannot extend direct realization of the transcen- dental Lord and His abode, but it can help one infer the existence of Bhagavan. For instance, with the appearance of dawn, one can guess that very soon there will be sunrise, yet he cannot know anything more about the sun from the dawn. 
This inference is of two types. An insentient object, such as a Now chair, is meant for a sentient being. Insentient objects do not exist for the service of other insentient objects. Similarly, the gunas of material nature are inert, so they must be appropriated and used by a sentient being. Then the question arises, which sentient being are the gunas meant for? A living being, although sentient, does not con- trol the gunas and thus he cannot be their owner or independent user. We might then infer the existence of a superhuman person who con- trols and utilizes these gunas of material nature. This process, how- ever, although perfectly valid, cannot award us direct realization of that Supreme Being. 
The second type of inference is to understand that every inert

or insentient object is illumined or activated by a sentient being. Knowledge of a chair cannot be attained by any other insentient object, nor can the chair move by itself. One can similarly under- stand that the gunas are inert and are activated by the energy of a sentient being, who is Bhagavan Himself. In Bhagavad Gitā, Kṛṣṇa explains that He impregnates material nature with His energy and thus sets the creation into motion: 
O descendent of Bharata, I impregnate the primordial material nature, the womb that gives birth to all beings. (GITA 14.3)51 
It is not possible for material nature to create the cosmos with- out the input of a conscious being. That conscious being is the Sup- reme Person, not a jīva. In this way, material sattva can take us as far as inferring the Supreme Person's existence, but cannot provide us any further enlightenment about Him. That is, however, possible through the viśuddha, or untainted, sattva. It is thus concluded that viśuddha-sattva is not material sattva; otherwise, Śrī Brahma could not have had direct realization of the Supreme Lord and His abode. 
Śrī Jiva now returns to the verse that was being commented on before the extended discussion of material sattva and suddha-sattva [see Section 7.2]. The remaining portion of the verse still under review is, "The residents there are worshipable by both devas and asuras" (harer anuvrata yatra surāsurārcitāḥ). Enishi has

We now resume our original discussion of the verse beginning with pravartate [SB 2.9.10]. A doubt might arise here, that if there are no material gunas in Vaikuntha, then it must be a place with- out any variety (nirviseṣa). To dispel this doubt, it is pointed out

that in Vaikuntha, variety is a manifestation of the potency that is of the nature of pure sattva and is nondifferent from the essen- tial nature of Bhagavan. To show this, the verse states that the residents of Vaikuntha (harer anucaraḥ) are worshipable by both the gods and their nemeses [the asuras, anti-gods].grindimelitese 
सुराः सत्त्वप्रभवाः । असुराः रजस्तमःप्रभवाः । तैरर्चिताः । तेभ्योऽर्हत्तमा इत्यर्थः गुणातीत- त्वादेवेति भावः । 
The gods (surah) are produced from sattva-guna, while the anti- gods (asuraḥ) are born from the gunas of rajas and tamas. That the devotees of Śri Hari are worshiped by both means that they are distinguished from both to the highest degree, as they are tran- scendental to the gunas of material nature.

Commentary 
POFF 
If the material gunas are absent in Bhagavan's abode, does it mean that Vaikuntha is void? Or if entirely void, is it uniformly pervaded with viśuddha-sattva and hence without any variety? No, Vaikuntha is full of variety. Thus, Śrī Sukadeva Gosvāmī has described the res- idents and their activities in verses 11-14. 
Sup 
The devotees there are exquisitely beautiful, their bodies daz- zling and decorated with fine clothes, sparkling gems and jewels; thus are they filled with the most uncommon splendor. Those who have attained särūpya-mukti have the same bodily hue and appear- ance as Bhagavan. The ladies are ravishingly beautiful and effulgent like lightning. Their bodies are endowed with natural fragrance, and so they do not need artificial perfumes, scents or other cosmet- ics. Clusters of shining airplanes crisscross the sky, appearing like clouds; the ladies seated within, like lightning. The airships are con- scious and thus do not require fuel, nor do they pollute the atmo- sphere. The Goddess of Fortune, the personification of all opulence, renders direct service to the Supreme Person. Her beauty and bodily fragrance is so wonderful that bumblebees become intoxicated and in ecstasy sing Her glories. These descriptions give us an inkling of the opulence found in Vaikuntha.gamefendin

Śrī Bhagavat Sandarbha A 
In the opinion of Srimad Bhagavatam, Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the original Person, Svayam Bhagavan, as will be demonstrated later.58 In the verses following this vision of Vaikuntha that is under discus- sion, Bhagavan instructed Srimad Bhagavatam to Śrī Brahma in the form of four seed verses. That it was Kṛṣṇa who did so is con- firmed by His statement to Śri Uddhava in the Third Canto: 
पुरा मया प्रोक्तमजाय नाभ्ये पद्मे निषण्णाय ममादिसर्गे । 
ज्ञानं परं मन्महिमावभासं यत् सूरयो भागवतं वदन्ति ॥ ५८ ॥ 
O Uddhava, in days of yore, at the beginning of creation, while he sat on the lotus growing out of My navel, I spoke to Brahma about supreme knowledge, which is My transcendental glory, which hi great sages call Srimad Bhāgavatam. (SB 3.4.13)59)

Svaiḥ (by His own) indicates that Bhagavan is endowed with the six opulences inherent in His internal potency (svarupa-śakti). When these powers are seen elsewhere, as in yogis, they are impermanent (adhruva), meaning that they are acquired [and not inherent in them] as a reflection of the original powers by the grace of Bhagavan. The word sve (in His own) means "in His own Self," and dhamani means "in Vaikuntha." Since Bhagavan delights in His own Self and in His own abode, He is therefore Iśvara, the Supreme Controller, and not dependent on anyone else for anything. oled sa ari berol arw and sat not evol yd ow diw mid of atoga has shed semiara

Here a doubt might arise that because Śrī Kṛṣṇa is situated in the spiritual realm, He has no contact with the architect of the material world, so why not accept that it was Śrī Viṣṇu (i.e., the Purusa) who blessed Brahma? In response to this, Śrī Sukadeva says that the reason for Śrī Kṛṣṇa's appearance was His excessive love for His devotee, indicated by the word priya, which means that Brahma felt love for Kṛṣṇa. The word priya, therefore, simul- taneously indicates that Bhagavan is controlled by His devotee's love. Moreover, the adjectives priyamāṇām (showing Him such love) and prita-manaḥ (pleased at heart) indicate the excessive delight the Lord felt at that moment due to these mutual loving feelings. Because Brahma was full of loving symptoms, the Lord also manifested excessive love for him, as indicated by the expres- sion, "words illuminated by a radiant smile" (işat-smita-rocișă gira), and by the touching of hands (kare spṛśan).

That Brahma is a worshiper of Śrī Kṛṣṇa has already been shown above in the verses quoted from Gopala-täpani Upanisad." This is again confirmed in Brahma-samhita: 
74 Though Śrī Brahma was born in the lotus growing from the navel of the Puruşa, 
his vision was of Bhagavan in His Nārāyaṇa form. Śrī Jiva said that it was Svayam Bhagavan Śrī Kṛṣṇa who gave instructions to Brahma, knowing the latter to be a qualified person to act under the discipline of His puruşăvatāra. That is the meaning of the phrase nija-śäsanärhana. For more information about puruṣāvatāras, see Paramatma Sandarbha, Anucchedas 1-17, or Laghu-bhagavatămṛta, chapter 2.

When time was instigated by the potency of Bhagavan, Śrī Brahma, learned in the four Vedas and possessing four heads, took birth from the lotus sprouting from the Lord's navel. After his birth, Brahma turned his mind to the work of creation under ans the impulse of previous impressions, but he saw only darkness 
in every direction. Then the goddess of learning, Sarasvati, said the following to Brahma: "O Brahma, this mantra, klim kṛṣṇāya Hogovindaya gopi-jana-vallabhāya svāhā, will assuredly fulfill your of heart's desire. Practice penance by means of this mantra and you vol will attain all perfection." Thus, Brahma, desirous of pleasing the ab bicimperishable Govinda, began penances that continued for a very 
long time. (Brahma-samhita 5.22-26)% visoka bedelinam vele Bio-time-inai) slime fociber

are two types of paramahamsas, or transcendentalists — the jñānī and the bhāgavata. Only the bhagavata-paramahamsas fully realize Bhagavan as He is? odw 212 12 11 ads awolfal 11,miH sesalg 
The Lord's heart melted when He saw Brahma so full of loving feelings, and so He came forward to shake hands with him to express His love. He knew that Brahma was able to perform the work of creation. Brahma had proven his mettle by following Bhagavan's instruction for one thousand celestial years, without having met Him personally. The Lord was convinced that Brahma was obedi- ent and would not deviate from His instructions. These are the basic qualities that inspire the Lord to invest responsibility in His devotee for any task. He intended for Brahma to do the work of secondary 
creation. 
Were Brahma to use only his own personal skills to perform the work of creation, the world would not function so meticulously. And so we find in the Śruti:

Śrī Brahma created the sun, moon and other planets as before. (RV 10.190.3)78 
bonthe 
This means that Bhagavan did not fancy a new design. The best design had already been conceived by the Supreme Lord and Brahmā simply had to follow His directions. Bhagavan gave him brief instructions, iṣat-smita-sociṣā gira. It is said that great people are not garrulous by nature (mahānto hi prakṛtyä mita-bhāṣinah).

After this, the Supreme Lord spoke the essence of Srimad Bhā- gavatam to Śrī Brahma in four seed verses (SB 2.9.32-35). Śrīla Vyasadeva later expanded these four verses into the eighteen thou- sand that form Bhāgavatam as we know it today. These verses will be discussed extensively in Sections 17 and 96.

Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi identifies the Supreme Lord who spoke to Śrī Brahma as Kṛṣṇa, son of Nanda Mahārāja. According to SB 2.9.6, Brahma was first ordered to perform penance (tapas). The verses here quoted from Brahma-samhita show that he was actually initi- ated into the eighteen-syllable Gopala mantra, which he chanted to

please Govinda. Since the presiding deity of this mantra is Gopala, or Kṛṣṇa the cowherd boy, and since Brahma performed tapas to please Him, it follows that it was Śrī Kṛṣṇa who appeared to him and not a Visņu form. For this reason Śrī Brahma prays to Govinda and not to Visņu in Brahma-samhita - govindam adi-puruşam tam aham bhajami. wri 
en This has also been confirmed in Gopala-tapani Upanisad, where Brahma says that the Supreme Lord appeared before him dressed as a cowherd boy-gopa-veśo me purastad ävirbabhuva. Furthermore, Śrī Kṛṣṇa also tells Uddhava that He spoke the four-verse Śrīmad Bhā- gavatam to Brahma (SB 3.14.13). Because this event took place after Brahma saw the Lord and His abode, it is clear that it was Śrī Kṛṣṇa Himself who spoke these verses to him. 
od? There is further confirmation of this in the Twelfth Canto, where Śrī Sūta Gosvāmi also concludes his narration of Srimad Bhagavatam by saying, "I meditate on the Supreme Absolute Truth, who enlight- ened Brahma on the wisdom of Srimad Bhagavatam" (kasmai yena vib- häsito'yam [...] satyam param dhimahi, SB 12.13.19). This satyam param is none other than Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the subject matter of Srimad Bhaga- vatam, as has been explained in Section 63 of Tattva Sandarbha.

The Characteristics of Bhagavan Are Inherent 
११ । अथ सा भगवत्ता च नारोपिता किन्तु स्वरूपभूतैवेत्येतमर्थं पुनर्विशेषतः स्थापयितुं प्रकरणान्तरमारभ्यते । तत्र वस्तुनस्तस्य सशक्तित्वमाह "वेद्यं वास्तवमत्र वस्तु" इत्यस्य विशेषणाभ्यामेव "शिवदं तापत्रयोन्मूलनम्” (भा० १।१।२) इति । शिवं परमानन्दः । तद्दानं स्वरूपशक्त्या । तापत्रयं मायाशक्तिकार्यं तदुन्मूलनं च तयैवेति ॥ श्रीव्यासः ॥ 
HERE WE BEGIN A NEW SECTION to specifically establish that the characteristics of Bhagavan are naturally inherent within His essential being and not imposed or acquired from elsewhere. First of all, Bhagavan is the Supreme Substantive or the Supreme Existent (vastu), and is endowed with potencies, as shown in the second verse of Śrīmad Bhāgavatam, where it is said by Vyasa that, "The Real Existent is to be known from this book" (vedyam vāstavam atra vastu, SB 1.1.2). That this Existent has potency is stated by the two adjectives śivada and tāpa-trayonmūlana. Śiva means the supreme bliss; śivada signifies that He grants this bliss to others by His internal potency. Tapa-traya means the three miseries that arise from the external energy, and unmūlana means that He uproots these miseries by this same internal potency.

attention to the characteristics of Bhagavan Himself. He says that Bhagavan's attributes and potencies are part of His essential nature (svarupa-śakti), they are not imposed. The technical term used here is āropa, which along with adhyasa is used by Sankarācārya and his followers to indicate the imposition of the properties of one object upon another. Śrī Sadananda Yogindra, a sixteenth century scholar in the line of Śankarācārya, defines this in his Vedānta-sära: 
To wrongly attribute the properties of an apparent object (avastu) upon an existing object (vastu), is called adhyāropa (superimposi- tion). Examples include mistaking a rope to be a snake, although it is not a snake, or considering Brahman, which is distinct from the form of the material world, to be the world? 
क 
According to the Sankara school, the underlying principle of superimposition is to mistake a real object (vastu) for an apparent one (avastu), due to ignorance (avidya). Vastu means a real object or substance, "That which remains at all times is called vastu" (vasati eva tişṭhati eva yat tad vastu). On the other hand, avastu is that which has empirical (vyavahārika), or apparent (pratibhāsika), existence, but does not exist in the true or ontological (päramärthika) sense. When, because of ignorance, a person mistakes a real object for an apparent one, this is called aropa, adhyāsa or adhyāropa. When some- one in semi-darkness mistakes a rope for a snake, he superimposes an apparent (pratibhasika) snake upon the rope, which is empirically real (vyavahārika). Prerequisites for adhyasa or adhyāropa include knowledge of the superimposed object based on previous experi- ence, unfavorable conditions for clear perception, sensory defects in the perceiver, and / or similarity between the two objects (e.g., a snake and a rope). 
SH 
The Advaitavādīs cite the Śruti, "All this is indeed Brahman" (sar- vam khalv idam brahma), to establish that Brahman is the only ulti- mate Reality. They say that we mistake Brahman for the empirical world that is unreal (avastu). When our ignorance is dispelled, only Brahman will remain. 80

11 The Characteristics of Bhagavan Are Inherent 
Following this line of reasoning, they also take Bhagavan's form, attributes and abode to be unreal in the ultimate sense. They mistak- enly think that these attributes have also been superimposed upon Brahman. To refute this deep-rooted misconception of the Advaita- vādīs, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi will furnish evidence over the next fifteen sections (Anucchedas 12-26) that Bhagavan's attributes, in particular His potencies (śaktis), are both real and inherent in His being. He begins by stating that the Lord's "God-ness" (bhagavattā, i.e., “the state of His being the Complete Whole, and the Supreme Person") is not superimposed (sã bhagavattă ca nãropită). 
To support this premise, he quotes from Srimad Bhagavatam, established in Tattva Sandarbha as the topmost authority on the mat- ter, "The vastava (Real) vastu (Substantive) is to be known (vedya) in this book (atra).” 
This means that Srimad Bhagavatam explains the Supreme Real- ity as distinct from apparition (avastu). Furthermore, it is possible for one to directly experience (vedya) this Reality. This has pre- viously been discussed in Tattva Sandarbha, where västava-vastu is identified as "nondual being-awareness," or advaya-jñāna of SB 1.2.11, with which this volume began. 
Here Advaitavādīs may claim that ultimate Reality is Brahman, devoid of qualities or energies, and hence, their philosophy of Rad- ical Nondualism, or Advaitavada, is the ultimate truth. Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi says, however, that this is not the complete truth. Although Reality is nondual being-awareness, it is not devoid of attributes or saktis. This is immediately shown in this verse, where the Real Existent (vastavaṁ vastu) is modified by two adjectives: sivada and tapa-trayonmūlana. Their import is this: understanding this Real- ity grants supreme felicity, dispelling the cumbersome influence of the threefold miseries created by the external energy (māyā). But this could only be possible if this Reality has potency inherent in its own nature. Unmulana means to uproot, implying that no trace of illusion or ignorance is left. If the energy of the Real Existent was superimposed, then it would not have the power to completely

uproot illusion. As the saying goes, svayam asiddham katham param sädhayati, "If one is imperfect, how can he make others perfect?" As an apparent snake, mistakenly seen in a rope in semi-darkness, can- not bite, Bhagavan superimposed onto Brahman cannot uproot mis- ery and bestow bliss. So it should be acknowledged that Absolute Reality is potent and He is called Bhagavan, as has been discussed in earlier sections.ad bus in dod sas (pipla) 
Non-theists (specifically the Advaitavadīs) accept only unqual- ified, i.e., attributeless, Brahman as the vastu, or Ultimate Reality. Nothing else has factual existence. However, Vaiṣṇavas (who accept Visņu or Kṛṣṇa as Supreme God) acknowledge that the material world is also real (vastu), in spite of its not being the vastava-vastu, or the truly abiding Reality, busteduc) stany (18) votal illu Śrīla Viśvanatha Cakravarti Thakura gives an explanation of the word vastu in his Sārārtha-darsini commentary on SB 6.16.51: 
nobirsage mon totalban ya 
Vastu (substance) is of two types - vastava ("real" or "abiding") and avāstava ("unreal" or "non-abiding"). Brahman, Paramātmā and Bhagavan, along with His abode and associates, are the only vastava- hur vastu, or abiding substance. The material world is avastava-vastu, or non-abiding substance. Avastu is also of two types, karya (having an empirical basis) and akarya (devoid of all empirical basis). Objects seen in dreams, hallucinations and so on, are karya, because they have a basis in previously observed phenomena. Objects that never exist to begin with, such as the horns of a rabbit, are called akārya. 
Lee 
thammi ei eid zo 
bus The subject of Srimad Bhagavatam is abiding substance, or the Real Existent (vastava-vastu), and since this subject is Bhagavan, the state or condition of being the Complete Whole (bhagavatta) cannot be imaginary or superimposed. 
Śivada and tāpa-trayonmulana are basic, affiliated effects of sädhana-bhakti, or devotion in the stage of practice. Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmi describes these as klesaghni and subhada:

11 The Characteristics of Bhagavan Are Inherent 
Commenting on this verse, Śrīla Viśvanatha Cakravarti Thakura writes, "Sadhana-bhakti uproots all types of miseries and grants aus- piciousness to the practitioner."4 
The three types of miseries are adhyatmika, miseries arising from one's own body and mind, such as disease, lust, anger and greed; adhibhautika, miseries inflicted by other living entities, such as snakes, mosquitoes or malicious people; and adhidaivika, mis- eries arising from the environment or nature, i.e., miseries brought about through cosmic influence or the controlling power of the gods (daivika), such as excessive heat and cold, tsunamis, earthquakes, volcanoes, storms and ozone depletion. These three types of afflic- tion are sometimes likened to the three-pronged spear that Durgā Devi holds in her hand, she being the warden of this prison house (durga) of the material world. 
When the word bhagavan is used to indicate great persons like Indra or Nārada, the secondary meaning (glorious or respectable person) must be accepted, and not the meaning of being "the pos- sessor of the six opulences," as explained previously in Section 1.3. Next Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi explains that some of Bhagavan's energies are contradictory by nature.

THE INTERNAL POTENCY (svarupa-śakti) and the external potency (māyā-śakti) are diametrically opposed to each other. Further- more, though each has many functions that are opposite to their counterparts, still their support is one, Bhagavan. Dakṣa speaks the following verse to the Lord:

Bhagavan's potencies are the source of dispute and consensus for the contenders of various philosophies. The rest of the verse's meaning is self-evident. 
da to 100qR Commentary 
adione qgo lautum 
AFTER ESTABLISHING that Bhagavan has integral potencies, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi explains that both the internal and external potencies have their ultimate support in the Lord. The internal and external potencies, even though counter-oppositional, like light and dark- ness, are perfectly supported by Bhagavan. One of the most won- derful characteristics of Bhagavan is that He accommodates oppos- ing qualities. Not understanding this inconceivable feature of the Absolute Truth, speculative philosophers argue endlessly about its nature. Some philosophers realize a certain aspect of the Lord (e.g., His formless aspect) and try to limit Him to that. Other philoso- phers believe what they consider to be an opposing view, that God is a person. Both camps then cite scripture and use logic to advance their respective philosophical conclusions. Dakṣa Mahārāja, how- ever, refers to the Lord as ananta-guna, one who has unlimited quali- ties. Unless we recognize this fact, we will remain bewildered about the personhood of Bhagavan. 
In the previous section, it was explained that while māyā inflicts the threefold miseries upon the living beings, the internal potency dispels them. Similarly, māyā causes bondage, whereas the svarupa- śakti grants liberation. In this way, māyā and its subdivisions func- tion in an opposing manner to the svarupa-sakti and its portions, yet both potencies are supported by the Lord. 
Śrī Vyasa's trance also revealed that maya is sheltered by Bhaga- van - māyāṁ ca tad-apāśrayam (SB 1.7.4)? The word ca (also) there indicates that there are other potencies, such as the intermediary potency. All these energies have various ganas, or subdivisions. Of these, the internal energy with its various divisions will be

To 
It is not only that one particular energy stands in opposition to another; sometimes even subdivisions within the same group act in mutual opposition, and yet they still coexist with the support of Bha- gavan. For example, the gunas of material nature are always vying for supremacy, yet they cannot exist independent of one another. 
In a ghee lamp, the flame consumes both the wick and ghee, but it also subsists on them. Ghee is motionless, yet it moves through the wick. Ghee can also, in certain circumstances, be used to extinguish the flame. In this way, different energies may also simultaneously be in disharmony (vivada) or in harmony (saṁvāda). 
In the next section, Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī will give further proof of the conflicting nature of Bhagavan's energies.

Commentary 
Śri Bhagavat Sandarbha 
ŚRILA JIVA GOSVĀMI now gives further evidence that Bhagavān has mutually opposing potencies. In this verse Dhruva Mahārāja prays to the Lord, who is standing before him in His personal form, yet he refers to the Lord as Brahman. He is "bliss alone" (ananda-mātra), unlimited (ananta), and without transformation (avikāra). In fact, these attributes apply equally to both unqualified Brahman and to the Supreme Person. The very fact that Bhagavan, a person, is nondifferent from unqualified Brahman is itself contradictory. 
Bhagavan is the source of the cosmos (viśva-bhava) and yet He undergoes no transformation, even though generally a source or cause undergoes some change when producing something else, such as a seed transforming into a sprout. Bhagavan is unlimited and all- pervading, and is nonetheless a person. This is contradictory, yet all such contradictions are reconciled in the Supreme Lord, who is the Absolute Truth. Hence, the Absolute Truth may be defined as that all-inclusive Reality wherein all contradictory extremes meet and are reconciled.

As explained earlier, Brahman is nondifferent from Bhagavan; therefore, the nature of Brahman is included in Bhagavan as well. The distinction lies in the vision of the particular transcenden- talist, in pursuance of his individual mode of worship. For the jñāni-bhaktas, he appears as Brahman; for those somewhat more advanced in bhakti, He appears as "the ground of cosmic creation" (viśva-bhava), and for the most advanced devotees, He appears as the Supreme Person, who is the source of all bliss (ānanda-mātra). The Śruti gives examples of some of these opposing characteristics:

In the previous section, the cited verse said that the Lord's ener- gies are the object of dispute among various philosophers. But no description of these energies or the nature of dispute was given. Now in this anuccheda, the verse directly mentions energies, such as knowledge and ignorance, and offers more details about the functions of these energies.

Commentary 
badm A 
MOTHER EARTH, in the form of a cow, spoke this verse to King Prthu, who had chastised her for neglecting to supply the necessities of life. Thereafter she begged forgiveness from the king. This story is nar- rated to Vidura by the sage Maitreya. 
This verse shows further how Bhagavan's energies may be in con- flict with each other. While He is the creator and maintainer of the cosmos, He is its annihilator as well. Moreover, these contrary potencies are simultaneously present in Him eternally. When He employs His creative potency, it is not that His destructive potency is lost, or vice versa. The simultaneous existence of these mutually opposing forces is logically inconceivable. 
Among the divisions of these energies, such as the material ele- ments, dravyāņi, some are naturally opposed to others. Water and fire are mutually destructive. Actions in sattva-guna lead to libera- tion, while those in the other gunas lead to bondage. The same action performed at different times or places or with a different attitude can yield opposing results. Bhagavan's personhood cannot be under- stood by mere scholarship as He is beyond reason and logic. All His potencies are inconceivable. This will be explained in the next section.

another. The question might arise, "How is such a thing possible? Does this not defy reason?" 850 2 SH 29llera sdi med rollame 
To answer, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī says that Bhagavan's energies are inconceivable. He cannot be understood by mere logic. 
Śrīmati Devahūti spoke the above verse to Kapiladeva, after being instructed by Him on the subjects of jñāna, vairāgya and bhakti. She was astonished to learn that her son was the Supreme Lord. She could not grasp how Bhagavan, who created Brahma from His lotus navel and who is the source of the cosmos, could have been within her womb. Thus, from her personal experience she declared that the Lord has thousands of inconceivable potencies.orstein 
Because Bhagavan's potencies act beyond the realm of logic, faith- less people take His pastimes to be myth. It is therefore advised that one faithfully hear the exploits of the Lord from the lips of a devo- tee; otherwise, one might fail to realize that Bhagavan, or the Per- sonal Nondual Whole, entails greater completion than its unqual- ified aspect, or Brahman, and thus reject Bhagavan's pastimes as fanciful stories. By doing so, they deny themselves access to the fur- ther reaches of consciousness in which Bhagavan is disclosed, and thus deny themselves the possibility of higher completion. 
Sections 9-11 of Tattva Sandarbha establish that Bhagavan can be understood only through revealed sound (sabda). Mere logic does not have the capability to divulge knowledge of Him. 
Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī next cites two sutras from Vedānta-sutra that also mention the inconceivable nature of His potencies. The sūtra prior to these two (vs 2.1.26) suggests that Brahman is with- out parts or divisions. One may object, saying that Brahman must have divisions, otherwise every action He performs, however minor, would be accomplished by use of His full power. This controversy is resolved by the first sūtra (vs 2.1.27), which states that the Vedas declare Brahman to be free from such internal divisions. Brahman does in fact possess such inconceivable potency that can accommo- date all opposing traits. This has already been discussed in previous 
sections. 
While commenting on this sutra, Baladeva Vidyabhuṣaṇa refers to Mundaka Upanisad: 
135 
aldaviar Śrī Bhagavat Sandarbha gad 
Sal The Lord is splendorous, inconceivable, and the greatest, yet He isona 
smaller than the smallest. He is near and far off as well. Indeed, Heo resides in the heart of the realized being. (MUU 3.1.7)3 
511 
Commenting on the words śabda-mūlatvāt, Baladeva writes: 
19116 BV9b 
Knowledge of Brahman can be obtained only from scriptures; there-96 fore, we have no authority to consider them illogical when they e describe paradoxical attributes within Him. Since only scriptures provide us with knowledge of Brahman, these descriptions of His dedinconceivable attributes must be accepted. This is not so completely mysterious, as even in this world it is seen that certain gems and la mantras produce supernatural effects resulting from inconceivable 
Power. 
Because something is inexplicable or inconceivable does not mean it should be dismissed as impossible. 
The second quoted sutra (vs 2.1.28) explains the existence of var- iegated power within the Lord. While commenting on this sutra, Śrīla Baladeva asserts that if gems and mantras have inconceiv- able power, then why not Bhagavan? He is the original source of everything.

In India there are certain healers who can cure incurable dis- eases by chanting mantras. That such a power exists in the vibration of certain syllables is inconceivable. But by seeing the effect, one cannot deny it. Similarly, by observing material nature, a devotee can understand that Bhagavan must have inconceivable power. 90T 29 stog aiH to suis ef 
Even modern science is forced to admit inconceivable phenom- ena. Light, for example, has the dual nature of being a particle as well as a wave, though this is contrary to logic. There are many such anomalies in science, which are nonetheless accepted on an empirical basis.

Bhagavan's Energies Are Intrinsic 
16.1 
१६ । शक्तेस्तत्स्वाभाविकरूपत्वमाह (भा० ११।३।३७ ) - 
SAGE PIPPALAYANA INFORMED KING NIMI that these energies are naturally existent in the Lord: 
सत्त्वं रजस्तम इति त्रिवृदेकमादौ सूत्रं महानहमिति प्रवदन्ति जीवम् । ज्ञानक्रियार्थफलरूपतयोरुशक्तिर्ब्रह्मैव भाति सदसच् च तयोः परं यत् ॥ ७७ || 
It is Brahman' alone that appears as both cause and effect, and is yet beyond them both. Though one in the beginning, it first manifests as the (inactive state of the) three gunas of sattva, rajas and tamas. As it involves further, this Brahman is called sutra, "the state of primordial nature when first destabilized, becom- ing active," mahat, "the first modification of primordial nature, as the cosmic intellect" and ahankara, "modification of the cos- mic intellect into the individual I-principle," by which the jiva identifies with matter. Brahman thus exhibits its great poten- cies in the form of cognitions, actions, objects and consequences. (SB 11.3.37)2 
1 Although it sometimes seems a little awkward, we have kept to Jiva Gosvāmi's 
usage of the neuter throughout most of this anuccheda. So rather than referring to "the Lord," the referent is Brahman or Parabrahman, and the corresponding pronoun is it rather than He, at least wherever Śrī Jiva uses tat rather than sa, on the assumption that his referent is Brahman. Note especially GĪTĀ 13.12, etc., and VP 1.22.54, found in Anuccheda 16.4.

Brahman alone exists, inherently self-endowed with great potency, uru-sakti, which means that it encompasses variegated potencies within its essential nature. The word eva ("alone" or "only") indicates that this potency belongs to Brahman alone; it is not imaginary. By this, the speaker informs us that this potency is its essential nature. The reason is that transcenden- tal Brahman is grossly manifest (sat) as the effect in the form of the material elements, like earth and so on, and subtly manifest (asat) as the cause in the form of primordial nature. Both of these are its external manifestations (vaibhava). Beyond this are its internal manifestations, such as Vaikuntha, and also the inter- mediary manifestations as the pure living beings. If Brahman has no natural energies, then all such manifestations would be impossible.ginized ads ni sno guod sonshivs iwasio 102 to 20gup od120 guliziano (vi) bloissad odt se

In what forms do all these manifestations of Brahman exist? The sage Pippalāyana answers, "in the form of cognitions, actions, objects and consequences" (jñāna-kriya-artha-phala-rupataya). As the cognitive potency (jñāna-śakti), it manifests in the form of mahat-tattva [the cosmic intellect or wisdom principle], and so on; as the active potency (kriya-śakti), it manifests as sūtra (pri- mordial nature when it first becomes active), and so on; and as objects (artha), it manifests as the tan-matras (the subtle aspect of the material elements, i.e., their potentials of sound, sight, touch, taste or smell), and the gross elements. As the homoge- neous state of all these, it manifests in the form of primordial

nature (prakṛti). In these ways, Brahman manifests as cause and effect (sad-asad-rupa). As the fruit or result (phala), however, it is beyond both cause and effect. The fruit here refers to the embodiment of the ultimate goal of all human endeavor, namely, the conscious Existent (cid-vastu) known as Bhagavan along with all His opulences. The pure jiva, or the pure living being, which is similarly a conscious existent (cid-vastu), is also considered as the fruit (phala), because the pure being in its totality follows in accordance with (tad-anugata), or is naturally drawn towards, the conscious Whole that encompasses it. The great potency of Brahman is shown by its manifestations in the form of cognitive power, the potency to act, and so on. am vizorg ai nemdrad Ist testinem vidua bas,no os base de dilatomels leistam sci शक्तेः स्वाभाविकरूपत्वं सप्रमाणं स्पष्टयति - आदौ यदेकं ब्रह्म तदेव सत्त्वं रजस्तम इति त्रिवृत्प्रधानम् । ततः क्रियाशक्त्या सूत्रं ज्ञानशक्त्या महानिति । ततोऽहमहङ्कार इति । तदेव च जीवं शुद्धस्वरूपं जीवात्मानं तदुपलक्षणकं वैकुण्ठादिवैभवं च प्रवदन्ति वेदाः ।

It then further transformed into sūtra as the active potency and into mahat-tattva as the cognitive power. After this follows aham, the I-principle, or ego. The Vedas describe that this very Brahman is the jiva in its pure state, which is also indicative of Bhagavan's opulences, such as Vaikuntha.s

14016 Bhagavan's Energies Are Intrinsic 
The fact that Brahman was alone in the beginning and then vari- ety manifested out of it proves that energy is innate in Brah- man. Because nothing else existed, there is no possibility that these energies are the result of something external to Brahman. Although the powers in Brahman's essential nature are eternally part of it, like the limbs and organs of its body, they are depen- dent on the existence of Brahman, just as atomic particles of sunlight are dependent on that of the sun. As such, Brahman is both their material cause and support. The Vedas affirm this: "All this shines with its light" (KU 2.2.15).*

of snevaleggi va muloge sans pasla Radiopash army anuluad Aada to se oris mode les pures) THERE ARE MANY SCHOOLS OF PHILOSOPHY IN INDIA. One of the most influential amongst them is the Advaitavada of Sankarācārya, which holds that ultimate Reality is without any attributes or ener- gies. According to this school, Bhagavan is a secondary manifesta- tion of this ultimate Reality, and His energies and form are not, in the final analysis, eternally true. According to them, Bhagavan is a reflection of Brahman in māyā, or with some limitation (upadhi) of ignorance (avidya). According to them, Brahman is the only ulti- mate Reality. They recommend the worship of Bhagavan only for people who are unqualified to realize nirguna Brahman directly. Such a concept of Bhagavan and His worship contradicts the Bhā- gavata theology, and therefore, Śrī Jīva systematically and lucidly delineates the essential reality of Bhagavan. 
Savious 
The preeminent characteristic of Bhagavan is that His omnipo- tence manifests in variegated ways. To understand the personal fea- ture of God, therefore, it is essential for us to understand His poten- cies and their relationship to Him. One basic and vital element of that understanding is that His energies are inherent in Him. They are not borrowed or superimposed on Him from outside of Him- self. The various manifestations of His potencies, which are without

limit, can neither overwhelm Him nor can they act or exist indepen- dent of Him. They are subservient to Him and He manipulates them at His will. 
Another remarkable feature about Bhagavan's energies is that although they function harmoniously, they never mix with each other. Each remains in its own realm and the apparent imperfec- tions of any one of them never stigmatize the Lord. There is in fact no imperfection in any of His energies. Any apparent imperfection is merely a matter of point of view. What appears as an imperfec- tion from the point of view of a finite individual being is not seen as imperfection from the standpoint of the infinite Supreme Person. 
To explain how God has variegated energies, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi cites a verse spoken by Pippalāyana to King Nimi, who had inquired (SB 11.3.34) about the nature of the Absolute." The verse describes the energies of Bhagavan. Uru-śakti, the most significant term in this verse, means powerful energy or manifold energies. Bhagavan has abundant energies and they manifest in a variety of forms. What- ever exists, whether manifest or unmanifest, subtle or gross, is the energy of Bhagavan. This is the significance of the indeclinable eva (only) in this verse. 
basm 
We are also part of His creation and the one thing we know with- out doubt is that we exist. No one can claim to be without exis- tence, nor can anyone consciously experience the extinguishing of consciousness. Conscious beings are real and so is our experience of our existence. This implies that God's energies are not imaginary. If God already has uru-sakti, then what need does He have for imag- inary energies? A person who owns many milk cows does not day- dream about getting a cup of milk. 
The Lord is the source of the material and spiritual dimensions and of the living beings as well:

I am the source of all spiritual and material worlds. Everything vist emanates from Me. The wise who perfectly know this engage in Mys 
devotional service and worship Me with all their hearts. (GĪTĀ 10.8)6)

16 Bhagavan's Energies Are Intrinsic 
The verse by Pippalayana explains how this material world pro- ceeds from Bhagavan. Before the creation, only He existed and only He will exist after the dissolution, as the Lord Himself confirms in Catuḥ-sloki of Bhagavatam: bod

se radio be I alone existed before all this creation, when there was nothing else, neither cause nor effect. After the creation takes place, all this is also I. And in the end, I alone will remain. (SB 2.9.32)" 
The material manifestation undergoes perpetual cycles of cre- ation, existence and dissolution. The words aham eva (I alone) refer to the pre-creation state. At that time all the material elements exist in their causal, inactive and equilibrated state, called pradhana, in which the sum total of all forces is zero. This pradhana is called trivṛt because it is comprised of the gunas of sattva, rajas and tamas. When the Lord destabilizes the neutralization of force that is pradhana, it is called sutra, which signifies the active potency. A further modifica- tion in sutra gives rise to mahat-tattva, the cosmic intellect, indica- tive of the power of knowing. From mahat-tattva comes the ego in three gunas, which further gives rise to the senses and sense objects. In this way, it is Brahman or the Lord who manifests everything in the material world. But this is not His complete manifestation. He also eternally manifests the spiritual planets, which are all beyond the material gunas and are thus free from the imperfections of the material world. 
The principal implication that Śrī Jiva draws from this verse is that potencies are inherent in Brahman. That is the significance of using the term Brahman here rather than Bhagavan. If before cre- ation only He existed, there is no question of His energies being bor- rowed or superimposed from anywhere. His potencies must origi- nate in Him. Since potencies are inherent in Brahman, the potent feature of the Absolute Truth as Bhagavan can be deduced.

it is understood that His abode and associates were with Him, as they are manifestations of His internal potency. Just as when it is said that the president of the United States lives in the White House, it means that his family members, bodyguards, personal assistants and other servants also live there. Bhagavan is like the Sun God and the spiritual creation is like the sun planet, which is dependent on, nondifferent from, and coexistent with Him.

Commentary 
मन् 
8.01 
To further explain the inconceivable and intrinsic nature of Bha- gavan's energies, Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī refers to a dialogue between Maitreya and Parāśara Munis from Visnu Purāna. In the previous chapter, the sage Parāśara had described the Lord both as creator, maintainer and annihilator of the cosmos and as being beyond the gunas of nature. Hearing this, Maitreya Muni posed a question that assumes the Lord to be formless Brahman. In the material world, an agent must have a material body, senses, and mind. He has likes and dislikes, is limited, and is under the influence of karma. If the Lord is free from all these, as had been described by the sage Parāśara, then how can He be an agent for any action?92929 Jon o zamot bas 
This question was asked from the non-personal, or in other words non-theistic, standpoint. All transcendentalists agree that there is a unity behind the diversity in creation. The Advaitavadīs, however, presume that Ultimate Reality could not possibly have form, variety, energy, attributes or action, and consequently that it must be devoid of personhood. They say that if Reality had any of these features, it would be no different from anything in the lim- ited mundane realm. They contend that scriptures describe what is unknown to us. Since duality, form and action are within our own common, everyday experience, the Supreme Reality must be beyond such things; that could only be Brahman, free from any attributes. Śrī Maitreya raised the doubt based on this line of thought. 
In answer to Maitreya's question, Parāśara Muni first establishes that Absolute Reality has inconceivable energies from which form, variety and action unfold. Although it is beyond our experience that an entity with form and attributes can be transcendental, eternal aldingyong sud

Śrīdhara Svāmī here makes a lengthy comment: "It was previ- ously stated that Brahman is the agent behind the creation, main- tenance and dissolution of the cosmos. Śrī Maitreya now raises a doubt about this proposition. In this verse ( vP 1.3.1 ), nirgunasya (free of material qualities) means that the gunas of sattva, rajas and tamas are not present in Brahman. Aprameyasya (immea- surable) means not limited by space, time and so on. Suddhasya (completely pure) can mean either without a body or without any assistants. Amalātmā (spotless in essence) means that Brahman is free from any effects of pious or sinful acts, or from impurities like attachment and repulsion. How can Brahman, whose nature is such, be the agent behind the creation of the cosmos when we see that agents in this world, such as a potter, are exactly the opposite in nature? ng tattoo your miestensbrium betr परिहरति - शक्तयः इति सार्द्धेन । लोके हि सर्वेषां भावानां मणिमन्त्रादीनां शक्तयोऽचि- न्त्यज्ञानगोचराः । अचिन्त्यं तर्कासहं यज्ज्ञानं कार्यान्यथानुपपत्तिप्रमाणकं तस्य गोचराः सन्ति । यद् वा अचिन्त्या भिन्नाभिन्नत्वादिविकल्पैश्चिन्तयितुमशक्याः केवलमर्थापत्तिज्ञा- नगोचराः सन्ति ।

Here, since there is a manifestation of a multifarious creation on the one hand, and Brahman, described both as its source and without attributes, on the other, the contradiction can only be resolved by the presumption of energies in Brahman.

Here ends Śrīdhara Svāmi's

16 Bhagavan's Energies Are Intrinsic 
Commentaryanib 20 di ono as storier sound pizsgress (inquit) roitgmusing to radios onto honeygrens Śrīdhara Svāmi comments on these verses of Vişņu Purana, saying that the Absolute's energy is acintya-jñäna-gocara - inconceivable, yet perceptible. This is the most crucial factor in understanding the Absolute as Personal God. Otherwise, one is bound to succumb to the seemingly powerful arguments of the Advaitavadīs. The Abso- lute must be accepted as inconceivable (acintya); otherwise, it will remain a plaything in the hands of the mental speculators. Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi therefore repeatedly stresses this acintya aspect of the Lord. It was Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī, in fact, who coined the term Acintya-bhedabheda-vāda (inconceivable simultaneous distinction within oneness) to name the philosophy propounded by Śrī Caitanya Mahaprabhu and His followers. His ton aliud qbus ordŚrīdhara Svāmi gives two definitions for the compound word acintya-jñāna-gocara. Acintya-jñāna means knowledge beyond logic (tarkāsaha). Although energy is beyond logic, its existence has to be accepted because no task can be accomplished without it. Śankarācārya also accepts this, "The effects of any energy are inher- ent in it" (śakteś cätma-bhūtām kāryam, Sankara-bhāṣya 2.1.18). If a person suffering from leukemia is cured by a chanter of mantras or a soothsayer, this will appear illogical from the viewpoint of a physician, who thinks the disease incurable without removing the impurities from the blood. For him, it is irrational that leukemia can be cured by a simple incantation. Nevertheless, if a disease is cured by mantra, then we must accept, logically, that the mantra has a certain power that is inconceivable to the ordinary rational mind. In this regard Śrī Kumārila Bhaṭṭapāda writes: 
One can never question the natural energy inherent in an object. How can one deny the fact that it is fire that burns and not the sky? (Śloka-värttika 5.12.29)16 Tuono 62 
Śrīdhara Svāmi's second definition of acintya-jñāna-gocara is based on our inability to decipher how energy is related to its potent

energetic source, whether as one with, or different from, it. Yet, energy is accepted on the authority of presumption (arthāpatti). Presumption means we assume a cause by seeing its effect. If a per- son is hale and hearty, but does not eat during the day, then we assume he must eat at night. Yet, in the case of a magnet, it is dif- ficult to say whether its power is one with the magnet or distinct from it. Its energy can be felt outside the magnet and this makes it appear different; yet, this energy is not present in the absence of the magnet. Thus, no one can deny that the magnet has inherent power. This feature of energy is called acintya-jñāna-gocara and, according to the sage Parāśara, all real objects have this attribute. 
not That the Absolute has form and attributes is beyond our experi- ence and is inconceivable. This has to be accepted on the authority of scriptures. But it is not entirely beyond logic. The Absolute is defined as complete, unlimited and perfect. In keeping with this, the Vedas describe the Absolute Truth as the source of everything - all qualities, attributes and varieties must be contained in it. 
Furthermore, as pointed out earlier, the Absolute is that all- inclusive Reality in which all contradictions and opposing potential- ities exist in harmony. Hence, qualities of both form and formless- ness inherently exist in the Absolute Truth. This conclusion is quite logical, though one must agree that it is inconceivable to us how it all works. Nevertheless, to deny it is to go against logic. We have to allow that such a supra-mundane Absolute Person can exist just to fulfill the literal meaning of the word "absolute." In the same breath, we have to concede that such a Person must be acintya, inconceiv- able. Inconceivable, however, does not mean incomprehensible or ineffable (anirvacaniya).

Jusion thereo 
It follows that this inconceivable person has inherent, natural powers (svabhāviki śakti), because the Absolute contains everything: all variety, all energy and so on, without limit. Being the Absolute Person and inherently self-endowed with potency, it follows that He is the agent, wielder and manipulator of all potencies. And yet He has no material form. He is in possession of the material energy, yet He is not in contact with or influenced by it. He is all-pervading, yet He is a person. 
15016 Bhagavan's Energies Are Intrinsic 
Upon seeing His creation, no one can deny that God possesses energies. A creation must have a creator, and that implies intel- ligence, potency, knowledge and activity. Thus, Svetasvatara Upanisad says, "He is naturally endowed with the potencies of knowl- edge, will and action" (svabhāvikī jñāna-bala-kriya ca, śu 6.8). In order to create, one must have the necessary knowledge, desire, energy and resources. By presumption (arthapatti) we are obliged to accept that the Lord has natural energy in Him. This energy is one with Him, as it cannot exist without Him, and it is different from Him, as He exists independent of its products. This oneness and distinction of potency and Potent is inconceivable.nl zeam 
It is to be noted here that although energy is contained in an object, in this discussion the same objects are also treated as ener- gies of Bhagavan. The reason is that just as energy cannot exist with- out its potent source, no object can exist without the Lord. Bhagavan is the only supremely independent entity. This is the import of the Śruti statement, "All this shines forth after His brilliance.""" 
agrind Another vital consideration about the Absolute as Personal God is that His energy cannot be subdued by anyone. This is because nothing exists which is superior to Him. Bhagavan Himself says: 
There is no truth superior to Me. Everything rests on Me, as pearls are strung on a thread. (GĪTĀ 7.7)18 
In the material world a superior power overwhelms an inferior power, just as the brilliant lighting of an outdoor tennis court, which belittles the glow of a glow worm at night, is barely noticeable in sun- light. The burning power of fire can be subdued by chanting certain mantras or by throwing certain herbs in it. Vedic literature also men- tions a gem called the candra-kanta, in the proximity of which, fire loses its burning capacity. Certainly water can subdue the burning potency of fire, but Bhagavan's energy cannot be curtailed by any such means.

The next point Parāśara establishes is that these energies natu- rally belong to Bhagavan. His energies do not dissipate like heat leaving water, causing the water to return to its natural temper- ature. His energies do not deteriorate or suffer reduction in any way. Śvetāśvatara Upanisad states, "Material nature is called māyā and the Lord is called Mayi - the possessor of maya." The word māyi is formed by applying the nini suffix to māyā. As was discussed in Section 5, suffixes such as matup and nini are applied to indicate excess, criticism, glorification, eternal relation and so on. In the case of mayi, the suffix is applied to show eternal possession. This means that Bhagavan is always the controller of maya. The mantra from Svetāśvatara Upanisad refers to Bhagavan as Maheśvara, or the Supreme Controller. Thus, māyā can never subjugate Bhagavan, as confirmed in Bhagavad Gitā: 
Material nature, which is one of My energies, is working under My direction, O son of Kunti, producing all moving and non-moving beings. Under its rule, this manifestation is created and annihilated bocagain and again. (GĪTĀ 9.10)19dos coinshrams Lallyed on A berised ataiitty laneynard bonbdue id forms versus 2 media

Here it should be understood that Maitreya asked his ques- tion under the assumption that Brahman is without attributes, whereas Parāśara answered from the point of view that it does have attributes. Therefore, Śrīdhara Svāmi defined the word śuddhasya (pure) in Maitreya's question as adehasya (without a body). However, because the answer established that Brah- man does innately possess qualities, it is our opinion that the

word "pure" should be defined as kevala (unconditional being, exclusively its own, uncompounded with anything else). In the opposing view, there are no energies in Brahman. yd.boubdue

As such, even from the question, another meaning can be ascer- tained. The word nirgunasya [translated above as "free of mate- rial qualities"] means free from manifested material and spiri- tual qualities. This implies that Brahman is aprameya, beyond the scope of any means of acquiring knowledge (pramāṇa). This in turn indicates that it is amalātmā (spotless in essence), or suddha (pure). Whereas crystal is subject to alterations in appearance in proximity of foreign elements, it does not appear differently.

Furthermore, the idea of an Absolute without attributes was cast aside in order to prove that it does possess energies. As such, it was established that there is agency in Brahman.

Now this second explanation of the question is offered with a special purpose in mind, namely, that it can now be shown that the energies in Brahman are not adventitious, like heat in water, as shown by the Śruti, "Nothing is equal or superior to That" (u 6.8).20 The potency of gems and mantras is given as a counter-

example: whereas they are able to negate adventitious and seem- ingly natural qualities in objects, Brahman's energy cannot be subdued by anything external. This also has been shown. In both explanations, it is by the mere influence of the internal potency that Brahman remains free from the defect of contact with mat- ter, for it is devoid of absorption, involvement or entanglement in the work of creation, which is a transformation of the material gunas, such as sattva.

Moreover, in keeping with the widespread understanding of the word brahma as given in Chandogya Upanisad, "Indeed, all this is Brahman" (CHU 3.14.1),21 it is said that māyā, consisting of the gunas of nature, like sattva, is nondifferent from Brahman. Even so, Brahman is nirguna in that it is untouched by these gunas. By accepting this, it is acknowledged that the material gunas are external to Him (bahiranga). boworia nowane odrestrilsup two toodtiw stuloadA as to ssbi od odrgnibnstansban तदेतदेव “मायां तु प्रकृतिं विद्यात्” (श्वे० ४।१०) इत्येषा श्रुतिः स्वीचकार । “मायां च तदपा- श्रयाम्” (भा० १।७।४) इतिवन् महेश्वरत्वान् मायाया बहिरङ्गया आश्रय इति तां पराभूय स्थितमिति च लभ्यते ।

Therefore, as before, it is shown that all energies are natural in Him, and He is untouched by the defects of maya. This is estab- lished both by positive and negative concomitance: Positively it may be stated that Brahman has natural energies because of being a real entity, like fire. Negatively it may be stated that Brahman is not devoid of natural energies because of not being an unreal entity, like the horns of a rabbit. The Vedas state, "Know prakṛti, or primordial nature, to be māyā, and the Supreme Controller to be its owner" (su 4.10).

The explanation is as follows: The one Absolute Reality, by its nat- ural inconceivable power, always exists in four aspects: (1) as His own Self (svarupa); (2) as His inherent magnificence (tad-rupa- vaibhava), or in other words, the transcendental potency inher- ent in, and emanating from, His being; (3) as the living beings (jivas); and (4) as pradhana, i.e., the unmanifest material nature. These four aspects can be compared respectively to four distinc- tive aspects of the sun: the effulgence that forms the inner core of the sun globe, the sun globe, the sun's rays, and finally the sun's reflection. Visnu Purāņa similarly states: 
Wएकदेशस्थितस्याग्नेज्र्ज्योत्सा विस्तारिणी यथा ।

Parabrahman's energy is of three types - internal, intermediary and external. By His internal energy, called svarupa-sakti, He exists in His complete form, as well as in the form of His inherent magnificence (svarupa-vaibhava), such as the Vaikuntha planet; these can be likened to the sun and its orb. By His intermediary energy, He exists as the pure living beings, which are conscious by nature and are like the sun's rays. By His external energy, called māyā, which is compared to the variety of colors in the reflection of the sun's rays, He exists as the external magnificence (bahiranga-vaibhava) in the form of inert pradhana. These consti- tute the fourfold manifestation of Brahman. Because the jiva is one with the nature of Brahman, it is called the taṭastha, or inter- mediary, energy. Similarly, counting pradhana as a part of māyā, Viṣṇu Purāna summarizes the three energies in the following 
way:

The energies of Sri Viṣṇu are of three types: pară, or transcenden- lid tal [to māyā]; apară, or conditioned [by mayā], also called "the w to knower of the field" (kṣetrajña), i.e., the individual self; and thei third, avidya-karma, action rooted in ignorance.

The energy whose action ( karma), or effect, is ignorance (avidyā) is called avidyā karma, meaning māyā. Although this māyā is external, she is capable of covering the jiva who is constituted as the intermediary energy. This is stated in the second verse of Vişņu Purāņa cited above. Täratamya, or gradation, means that living beings exist with different degrees of covering, from sub- tle to gross, in different bodies, beginning with Śri Brahma down to the immovable living beings. This capacity of māyā is also men- tioned in Śrimad Bhagavatam where it is stated, "The living being is bewildered by her, māyā” (SB 1.7.5) 29 1 ni (ovaridiov.nphotiod)

Since the jiva is like a particle of sunlight making up the rays of sunshine that lie outside the orb of the sun, it is appropriately said that its powers can be eclipsed by maya's separating capac- ity. Thus, the verse from Vişnu Purana goes on to say that it is on account of maya that the intermediary energy exists in different gradations. This inconceivable māyā is the reason that pradhana, which is devoid of qualities such as consciousness and immutabil- ity, appears inert and mutable. That pradhana is a manifestation of māyā will be explained later on.

After quoting Śrīdhara Svāmi's commentary on the verses from Visnu Purāna, Śrī Jīva Prabhu gives his own analysis of those verses and commentary. The logical phrasing given to prove that Brahman has innate energies is according to the five-step syllogism of the Indian logic system (nyaya) called inference (anumana).30 Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī gives two phrasings, one positive, "Brahman has natural energies because of being a real entity, like fire" (brahma svābhāvika- śaktimad vastutvad agnivat), and one negative, "because it is not unreal, like the horns of a rabbit" (vyatireke śaśa-viṣaṇādivat). The five steps of the first syllogism will be as given in its simple form:

In this way, both from scriptural authority and logical inference it is proven that Brahman or the Supreme Lord has natural poten- cies. This completely shatters the theory of the Advaitavadīs that Brahman is without attributes, devoid of all energy and, when influ- enced by māyā, becomes individual consciousness, either as jīva, the conditioned being, or as Bhagavan. There are no upadhis of māyā that can limit or condition Brahman.ng maya. Although this maill ext Māyā can never influence Brahman but is always under its con- trol. Māyā is real. The manifestation of its energies is not like the appearance of color in crystal when kept in juxtaposition to a real object. Therefore, the world, which is a manifestation of māyā, is also real. 
A doubt may be raised here. Since Kṛṣṇa is the Lord of maya and of the living beings, all the defects belonging to them, such as trans- formation, inertness, and so on, must also exist in Him. Then how can Bhagavan be considered free from all inferior attributes and the possessor of all auspicious qualities, as claimed above in Section 5 (vina heyair guṇādibhiḥ, VP 6.5.79)?

In reply to this, the sage Pippalayana said in the central verse of this anuccheda, tayoh param (He is beyond both subtle and gross, or beyond cause and effect). Bhagavan is transcendental to the subtle and gross material world, just like a lotus leaf that stands in water but does not get wet. Although the cosmic creation is a manifesta- tion from the Lord - sarvam khalv idam brahma (CHU 3.14.1) — He is beyond it. Hence, the qualities that inhere in material nature do not appear in the person of the Supreme Lord. For this reason Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi concludes the section by saying, "These energies are lim- ited to their own domains and do not extend to Bhagavan in His own being."31 This is possible by His inconceivable potency, which can accomplish seemingly impossible acts.ai nedan moitigogor 
Generally, a material cause transforms into an effect, just as a seed transforms into a seedling. Bhagavan, however, is both the material as well as the efficient cause (abhinna-nimittopādāna- kāraṇa) of the creation, and yet is aloof from it. That is why Śrīdhara Svāmi describes acintya as, "The inability to decipher whether 
31 tat-tat-sthāniyatvam evoktam na tu tat-tad-rupatvam nilalang alistados 
16016 Bhagavan's Energies Are Intrinsic 
energy is one with or distinct from its potent source." The Lord is distinct because He does not undergo transformations. bib DqCreation cannot take place without Bhagavan because every action needs an agent. In the material world the material cause, referring to the ingredients used in production, is different from the efficient cause, which is the agent. Sometimes a spider is cited as an example of being both material as well as efficient cause because of its ability to produce a cobweb from the constituents of its own body. But the spider also has to eat to produce the saliva that makes the web. The Lord, however, is absolutely independent in the act of creation, maintenance and annihilation of the cosmos. Thus, Śrī Kṛṣṇa says in Bhagavad Gitā: 
I am the goal, the sustainer, the master, the witness, the abode, the refuge and the most dear friend. I am the creation and the annihila- tion, the basis of everything, the resting place and the imperishable seed. (GĪTĀ 9.18) 32 
siquor: A bhow Istre 
The important phrase in this verse is bījam avyayam, imperish- able seed. There is no seed in the material world that is imperishable. The seed perishes and gives birth to a seedling. Another distinction is that a seed has a source. But Bhagavan is a seed without a source. He is sarva-kāraṇa-karaṇa, or the source condition behind all causes, and He is anadi, or beginningless. He produces countless universes, yet remains intact. He is not diminished or transformed because of His being the source of everything. Thus, any defects in His energies do not reflect on Him. This is confirmed in the Śruti mantra: 
To in

The Supreme Truth is perfect and complete. This phenomenal world is also perfect and complete. Whatever emanates from the perfect and complete is also complete. Though one takes the complete away from the Complete Whole, what remains is still complete. (ISA 1)33

by Although the energy of Bhagavan is one, it manifests in three different ways: internal (antaranga), intermediary (taṭastha) and external (bahiranga). The internal potency is also called svarupa- sakti, or the energy that constitutes the very nature of God. It man- ifests as His abode along with all paraphernalia required for His pastimes:

The conscious potency (cit-śakti) is also known as the potency inher- ent in Bhagavan's very own being (svarupa-śakti), and as His internal potency (antaranga-śakti). Its transcendental manifestations are unlimited, including the Kingdom of God, Vaikuntha, along with all its variegated paraphernalia. (CC 1.2.101) 34mm

2610 boopprys spad 
The intermediary potency manifests as the unlimited living beings (jivas), which are of two types - nitya-mukta and nitya- baddha, ever-liberated and ever-bound.eans sid) has wubo 
The external energy, also called māyā, manifests the inert, muta- ble material world. Although all the energies of Bhagavan are anādi, or beginningless, the material energy undergoes mutation perpetu- ally. The Supreme Person, Kṛṣṇa, is likened to the Sun god; the inter- nal energy to the Sun orb; the living beings are like the atomic rays that exist outside the Sun; and maya is like the reflection of the sun's rays into darkness.98

Paramātma Sandarbha features a detailed description of the taṭastha-sakti. Maya-śakti will be further explained in Section 25 below, whereas various divisions of the internal potency will be described in Sections 100-101.

When the living beings are not in direct contact with the inter- nal potency, they remain under the influence of the external energy, which covers their intelligence (ajñanenävṛtam jñānaṁ tena muhyanti jantavaḥ, GĪTĀ 5.15, SB 1.7.5). Depending on the extent of the covering, living beings exist in various grades of life, beginning from Śrī Brahma down to a piece of stone. Even within a partic- ular species, there are different degrees of covering. Because the

By the inconceivable power of Bhagavan, māyā can cover the intermediary potency, although inferior to it. This is stated by Maitreya Muni while instructing Vidura: 
The external energy of the Supreme Lord acts contrary to logic; oth- erwise, how would it be possible that the living being, who is [by nature] conscious and liberated, becomes bound and miserable? (SB 3.7.9) 36 
Soyas to guides yd noubdued to

But it is clear from Visnu Purana verses that para-sakti is never covered by the external energy called avidya-karma. 
When a living being surrenders to Krsna, offering the self in lov- ing devotion, he becomes free from the clutches of māyā and eter- nally remains under the protection of the internal potency of Bhaga- vān. This is the highest goal of human life and the essential teaching of the Vedic literature. 
Another marvelous, inconceivable feature of Bhagavan is that His external energy produces pradhana, which is inert and mutable. These two characteristics, inertness and mutability, are opposed to the dynamic nature of God, and yet they emanate from Him. A mate- rial example of this is in the growth of hair and nails from the human body. Although consciousness pervades the entire body, the same body produces nails and hair, which are devoid of consciousness. Nails and hair are in contact with the body, derive their nourishment from it, and even grow, yet they are inert and mutable. It is astonish- ing that an inert object grows. Similarly, pradhana, though inert and mutable, is a product of Bhagavan's external energy. 
All three energies remain active within their respective domains and do not encroach upon each other. Thus, there is harmony among them. When the jiva is within the internal potency, it is in harmony with it, and when within the external energy, it is in harmony with that. The external energy never influences the internal energy. This

blanŚrī Bhagavat Sandarbha 
also implies that the shortcomings of these energies do not influ- ence God's own being, just as the presence of hair and nails do not encumber the person who grows them.

Commentary sman 
BY ESTABLISHING that Bhagavan has natural intrinsic potencies that manifest in three ways, Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī has laid the groundwork for a detailed description of the internal potency, svarupa-śakti. 
First he explains that Bhagavan's three energies fall into two cat- egories: cit (conscious) and acit (inert). The internal energy and the intermediary energy belong to the first group, the external energy to the second. Bhagavan owns both the conscious and inert ener- gies; otherwise, He could not be the supreme controller and enjoyer. Because potency cannot be separated from its potent source, Ulti- mate Reality is a nondual conscious entity, who is the subject matter of Srimad Bhagavatam. This was established in Tattva Sandarbhage This clearly negates the theory that Ultimate Reality is the form- less, impotent, indistinguishable, all-pervading Brahman. Rather,

17 Bhagavan Has Both Conscious and Inert Potencies 
Brahman is the particular realization of Bhagavan in which one does not distinctly perceive His energies, like seeing sunlight with- out clearly seeing its source, the sun itself. This type of indistinct God-realization is certainly possible because potency is nondiffer- ent from the Potent. When a spiritual aspirant is predisposed to con- ceive of the Absolute in terms of radical non-distinction, or exclusive abheda, this creates a barrier to the recognition of the distinction of potency, or bheda, within the nondual potent source. In this case, there is realization only of the abheda portion of the complete non- dual Whole, which, inconceivably (acintya) preserves its condition of nonduality while encompassing both bheda and abheda. Such indistinct realization barely touches the shore of the ocean of God realization pertaining to the complete personal nondual Whole. It is for this reason that Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī says that Brahman realization is an incomplete realization of the Absolute Truth. 
Non-distinction between potency and Potent is inconceivable, acintya. Other than declaring that Brahman is without any mani- fest qualities, there is nothing left to be said. The Advaitavādīs can describe Brahman only in negative terms. They say, neti neti (not this, not this), but what Brahman is they cannot say. Therefore, Tait- tiriya Upanisad states, "Speech along with the mind returns from Brahman, unable to grasp it" (TU 2.4.1). Of course, the Vaiṣṇava rendering of this mantra is that the mind and speech of a devotee are unable to completely capture and describe the personhood of Bhagavan.79 ters bisz 3H 2159fts bad to bong of seiz 
It is interesting that Jiva Gosvāmi quotes the chief of the asuras, Hiranyakasipu, as evidence that God has both conscious and inert energies. It shows that in bygone days even those antithetical to the gods did not consider the Absolute to be void or impersonal, nor did they think of the Absolute as nature, matter or any such notion. They had the logical sense to conclude that the cause of the cosmos cannot be insentient. This is in stark contrast to contempo- rary atheists, who uphold many foolish speculative theories in their attempt to establish inert matter or the void as the cause of all causes. Hiranyakasipu spoke this while glorifying Śrī Brahma, because he 
5 yato vaco nivartante apräpya manasa saha 
167 
alonso Śrī Bhagavat Sandarbha 
considered Brahma the ultimate creator and master of the universe. He is considered to be a demon because he opposed Śrī Visņu as Sup- reme, even though he did not deny His existence. The Advaitavādīs have a similar concept. bed sidetog viniero al noitesile-bo no Another significant point Śrila Jiva Gosvāmi makes is that a con- scious entity can only emanate from, and be supported by, another conscious entity. Consciousness does not spring from matter; hence, all conscious living beings must come from a conscious source, the Supreme Personal Absolute. This is certainly not to the lik- ing of materialistic philosophers like Cārvāka Muni or his modern counterparts, the reductionistic evolutionists. slidw vllaubnou to 
Long ago Carvāka, the most famous gross materialist in Indian history, proposed that there is no self and no God in control of exis- tence. The goal of life is to eat good food and enjoy the senses as much as possible. He said that consciousness comes into existence in the body at the time of birth and is finished at death; hence, there is no rebirth. Since this is the only life we live, we must enjoy it to the utmost. Śankarācārya summarized the view of this school in the following verse: yodams) vitsgon ni vino namera adimesh 
Heavenly enjoyment means eating delicious food, keeping the com- pany of young damsels, using fine clothes, perfumes, garlands and 99 sandalwood paste. (Sarva-siddhänta-sangraha 1.9) 
9910 
Again, according to Carvāka, there is no such thing as sin or piety that can give rise to good or bad effects. He said that even though the earth has no specific intoxicating quality, the fruit of the cat- echu or dhatura plant, which grows in the earth, does. The intox- icating quality comes into existence due to a special combination of chemical elements in the fruit. Similarly, consciousness mani- fests in the body due to a special combination of material elements. This philosophy is akin to the modern day evolutionists who have developed elaborate theories on the evolution of consciousness from the body's inert matter. Yet they themselves are unable to produce even a mosquito. These theories are very fascinating to those who

are attached to enjoying the senses. That is why the Indian philoso- pher was called cārvāka (lit., "beautiful speech"), or one who has a fascinating philosophy. 
On the whole, though, it is highly illogical that consciousness could arise from a combination of matter. That would be like saying that light comes from an arrangement of darkness, or that knowl- edge arises from a particular blend of ignorance. An effect is always dependent upon its causes. This understanding is called satkarya- vada by Śrī Iśvara Kṛṣṇa in his Sänkhya-kärikā. His explanation goes as follows: od dnshasakasthofr brebno eo god of 1960

1. That which is non-existent cannot produce anything. 
2. A product is always dependent on its material cause. 
3. A particular cause cannot produce effects that lie beyond its 
causal power. Rather, a particular cause gives rise only to 
a particular effect. 
4. Only a capable cause produces an effect. tab 
5. Cause transmutes into effect. (Sankhya-kārikā 9)' 
vlam

TH. 3o nos ad deM abelist If a particular attribute does not exist in the cause, it cannot appear in the effect. Oil can be squeezed from peanuts, but not from stone. Energy can be neither created nor destroyed, only trans- formed from one state to another. One can transform heat into light, but both are material energies. It is not possible to transform mate- rial energy into consciousness. Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi will throw more light on this satkarya-vāda in many places in Paramatma Sandarbha 
In the previous section, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī said that each of the Lord's three energies functions in its respective domain. They do not merge or encroach upon each other. This also lends support to the theory of satkarya-vada. In Tattva Sandarbha, Śrī Jīva Prabhu dis- cussed in detail that the physical body and senses cannot be the sup- port for the self, rather the Supreme Self is the shelter of all. A con- scious being can be the shelter for matter because of its superior

nature. In fact, matter is used in the service of conscious beings. It has no independent purpose. To study the internal potency, which is unfamiliar to us, Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī first gives a description of the external energy as a basis for comparison. The external energy is dependent on the internal, so if we first comprehend the nature of the material energy, which is an object of our experience, it will be easier to study Bhagavan's internal potency, which is beyond our sense perception. Tattva Sandarbha also explained how the topics of creation and dissolution are delineated in Śrimad Bhagavatam in order to help us understand the transcendental Lord. The devo- tees study the cosmos in order to appreciate Bhagavan's energies, whereas the atheists study it in an attempt to deny His existence. Their actual aim is to further exploit and enjoy this world; they are interested in the kingdom of God, minus God. 
Jiva Gosvāmī cites two verses from Visnu Purana that name the two energies as pară ("infinite" or "superior"), and apară ("finite" or "inferior"). Then he defines the external energy and follows with a detailed analysis of the definition10 
Interestingly, Prahlada Mahārāja, the son of Hiranyakasipu, is the speaker of the two verses from Vişņu Purāna. Demoniac Hiranyakasipu was so enraged by his son's devotion to Śrī Kṛṣṇa that he tried to kill him in various ways. In one of these attempts, he fastened boulders to Prahlada's body and threw him into the ocean. It was on this occasion that Prahlada recited these two verses in the prayer he addressed to Śrī Kṛṣṇa. 
thy The material energy is also eternal, śāsvata. As God is eternal, so are His energies. The internal energy is called Iśvarī, or Goddess, which means that She is like a queen who remains in the king's pri- vate chambers. The external energy, on the other hand, is like a maidservant, who must remain outside. This metaphor indicates that since māyā cannot directly associate with Bhagavān, she cannot influence Him. Nor can she influence His internal energy. 
10 In the traditional Indian philosophical system of argumentation, the general 
procedure is to first name the object (uddeśa), give a definition (lakṣana), and then examine the definition for any defects (pariksa); trividha câsya sastrasya pravṛttir uddeśo lakṣaṇam parīkṣā ca (Nyaya-vātsyāyana-bhāṣya 1.1.3). 
17017 Bhagavan Has Both Conscious and Inert Potencies 
The para energy is beyond mind, speech and sense perception (atita-gocara). It is transcendental, yet it can be understood by the pure living beings (jñāni-jñāna-paricchedya). The word jñānī in this compound means the devotional sages and not the monistic jñānis, who limit themselves to the unqualified feature of Bhagavan. According to Śrīdhara Svāmi, the word jñānī means the living being, and jñāna, the cognition of sense objects. Paricchedya means that all these sense perceptions are like streams of water flowing from a big lake, which signifies the internal energy. Just as these streams indi- cate the existence of the lake, the jiva's sense perceptions indicate the presence of a supreme source. In Anuccheda 19 it will be shown that the internal potency is the fountainhead of all actions even in the material world. 
Next, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi continues with a detailed exposition of the external energy, showing how māyā has two divisions.

ऋतेऽर्थं यत् प्रतीयेत न प्रतीयेत चात्मनि । 
तद विद्यादात्मनो मायां यथाभासो यथा तमः ॥ ८७ ॥ 
That which is perceived only when the underlying essential Real- ity (artha) is not perceived, but which is never perceived in the Self (ätmani), you should know to be My māyā, manifesting both as a reflection (abhāsa) and as darkness (tamas). (SB 2.9.33)1

In this verse, the word artha ("essence" or "meaning") refers to the supreme essential Reality (paramartha), namely, Bhagavan Himself. The Lord is saying, "Maya is that which is perceived when I am not seen, and is not perceived when I am seen. In other words, it is that which is perceived as external to Me."

18 Māyā's Two Divisions 
Furthermore, māyā is that "which is not perceived in the Self," meaning that it does not manifest independently without My sup- port. So, the entity that has such characteristics is called My, i.e., the Supreme Lord's, māyā śakti. It has two features, jiva- māyā and guṇa-māyā. In this analysis, the pure jiva is counted in the same category as Bhagavan because of its being likened to a ray/particle of the sun-like Lord and because of being conscious like Him. The two kinds of māyā can be deduced from the two examples in [the last quarter of] the verse. Lesso sarol mid तत्र जीवमायाख्यस्य प्रथमांशस्य तादृशत्वं दृष्टान्तेन स्पष्टयन्नसम्भावनां निरस्यति - यथाभास इति । आभासो ज्योतिर्बिम्बस्य स्वीयप्रकाशाद् व्यवहितप्रदेशे कथञ्चिदुच्छ- लितप्रतिच्छविविशेषः । स यथा तस्माद् बहिरेव प्रतीयते न च तं विना तस्य प्रतीतिस्तथा सापीत्यर्थः । अनेन प्रतिच्छविपर्यायाभासधर्मत्वेन तस्यामाभासाख्यत्वमपि ध्वनितम् । अतस्तत्कार्यस्याभासाख्यत्वं क्वचित् “आभासश्च निरोधश्च” (भा० २।१०।७) इत्यादौ । 
SIT 
Of these two, the first, namely, jiva-māyā, is referred to by the example of a reflection, which clarifies how the above-stated qualities are present in the jiva, and also refutes the objection of impossibility. The word ābhāsa refers to indirect light, i.e., the light that is somehow reflected into an area separate from where direct light falls. Just as a reflection exists outside its source, and yet cannot be perceived without it, so it is with jiva-māyā. By this quality of reflection, which is synonymous with praticchavi, it is implied that māyā can also be called ābhāsa. Therefore, its prod- ucts are also sometimes called ābhāsa, such as in SB 2.10.7, where the creation and dissolution of the cosmos are respectively called ābhāsa and nirodha 3

Sanskrit has several synonyms for reflection, such as pratibimba, praticchāyā, pratiphala, etc. Normally, abhāsa means something somewhat different from a “mirror image.”

Sometimes this very sunlight transforms into diverse forms in this polychromatic vision. Similarly, māyā covers the real consciousness of the living being, and manifests from within herself the inert material nature called guna-māyā, consisting of the gunas in their balanced, or equilibrated, state. Sometimes she transforms the different gunas into various forms. This was stated earlier in the quote from VP 1.22.54, "Just as the light of a fire situated in one place is diffused all around."

In this way, the instrumental, or sentient, aspect of māyā is called jiva-māyā, and the material, or insentient, aspect is called guna- māyā. This will be further analyzed later on. 
अथैवं सिद्धम् – जीवमायाख्यं गुणमायाख्यं द्वितीयमप्यंशं दृष्टान्तेन स्पष्टयति “यथा तम” इति । तमः शब्देनात्र पूर्वोक्तं तमःप्रायं वर्णशाबल्यमुच्यते । तद्यथा तन्मूलज्योतिष्यसदपि तदाश्रयत्वं विना न सम्भवति तद्वदियमपीति । Bomba 
Thus, the portion of maya called jiva-māyā has been explained. The second portion, called guna-māyā, is illustrated through the example of darkness (tamas). The word tamas refers to the previously mentioned polychromes, which are almost like dark- ness. Just as this polychromatic effect can exist neither in the light source nor without it, similarly māyā also cannot exist in Bhagavan, nor without His support. 
अथवा मायामात्रनिरूपण एव पृथग्दृष्टान्तद्वयम् । तत्राभासदृष्टान्तो व्याख्यातः । तमोदृष्टा- न्तश्च । यथान्धकारो ज्योतिषोऽन्यत्रैव प्रतीयते ज्योतिर्विना च न प्रतीयते । ज्योतिरात्मना चक्षुषैव तत्प्रतीतेर्न पृष्ठादिनेति तथेयमपीत्येवं ज्ञेयम् । ततश्चांशद्वयं तु प्रवृत्तिभेदेनैवोह्यं न तु दृष्टान्तभेदेन । 
Alternatively, both of these examples [of reflection and darkness] separately describe māyā [in its entirety] and not its two divi- sions. In that case, the example of reflection, abhāsa, is the same as given above. The example of darkness would be as follows: Darkness is perceived only in a place devoid of light, but not with- out the help of light. It is perceived by the eye, which depends on the energy of light, and not by the back etc. [i.e., not by anything which is merely turned away from the light]. Māyā is to be under- stood similarly. Thus, [in this way of looking at the phrase yathāb- hāso yathā tamaḥ], the two divisions of maya are to be understood by their different functions and not by the different examples. 
प्राक्तनदृष्टान्तद्वेधाभिप्रायेण तु पूर्वस्या आभासपर्यायच्छायाशब्देन क्वचित् प्रयोगः । उत्त- रस्यास्तमः शब्देनैव चेति । यथा ( भा० ३ । २०।१८) - 
In the first way of interpreting the examples, jiva-māyā is called chāyā, a synonym for abhāsa, and guṇa-maya is referred to only by the word tamas. Srimad Bhagavatam states:

Śrī Bhagavat Sandarbha 
Commentary dog bo sgbalwon diodeverbbu O babatwont do dog vM to anolamaqxs 918,byam to ŚRILA JIVA GOSVĀMĪ IS IN THE PROCESS of explaining the Lord's two types of energy: para and apară. Pară means distant, beyond, supe- rior and so on. The energy is called para because it is superior to, or beyond, the material energy, which is thus called apară, i.e., near or inferior. In Bhagavad Gita, Kṛṣṇa also states that the living beings can be counted as pară, because of their conscious nature: A 
ima edi ni badirash This eightfold energy (the material nature) is called apară, but differ- ent from it, O mighty-armed one, is the para energy of mine, called the jiva, by which this world is sustained. (GĪTĀ 7.5) 10 
stinam adf 
abog sis doidw 
To understand pară, first apară is explained because it is eas- ier to understand. This is called candra-śäkha-nyaya (the branch- moon principle), by which one precedes the development of a more complex argument by first explaining an easier point, just as one might first point to the branch of a tree to show someone where the moon is. 
To define the apară, or external energy, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī cites one of the four seed verses of the (Catuḥ-sloki) of Bhagavatam that Śrī Kṛṣṇa spoke to Brahma at the dawn of creation." In this verse, the Lord defines His external energy, māyā. The term māyā has various meanings, such as false, cheating, illusion, compassion, power, wis- dom, entanglement, the Goddess of Fortune, magic and so on. Kṛṣṇa here uses it in the sense of the energy that causes bewilderment, the external energy. ut beidimas boat (tooth) broder 
According to this verse, the basic characteristics of maya are as follows:

1. Māyā does not exist within Bhagavan. 2. Mäyä does not exist without Bhagavan. 
3. Mäyä exists outside Bhagavan.jyot

18 Maya's Two Divisions 
at A doubt may be raised concerning this definition. A conditioned living being also has the above characteristics, and thus, this defi- nition has the defect of being too broad (ativyapti-dosa). To avoid this, Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī says that the jiva is conscious and has been counted in the same category as Bhagavan. Moreover, the above def- inition should include the jiva-māyā and guṇa-māyā features, which are indicated in the verse. Māyā is not in the para-sakti. This also implies that it is not in the svarupa of the jiva, or in the nature of the living being, and this is good news. Were maya part of the jiva, there would be no question of being liberated from it.mogus 
This explanation of māyā defies the monistic view. Monists say that māyā is neither sat (real), asat (false), nor a combination of both. It is different from both, and yet not non-existent. Thus, it is inexpli- cable, or anirvacaniya, and antagonistic to knowledge. Śankarācārya describes māyā as follows: 
JonnessWoldavisto 
bor Maya is neither sat nor asat, nor is it a combination of sat and asat. It abis neither different from, nor one with, Brahman, nor is it different 
from and one with it simultaneously. It does not have limbs or divi- sions, nor is it without them, nor is it a combination of both of these conditions. Māyā is most astonishing and inexplicable. (Viveka- cūḍāmani 111)12 
dind 
(top) an 
The reason for such an explanation is due to the fact that Radi- cal Nondualists do not accept the potencies of Brahman. Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi, however, establishes that the Absolute is full of inconceiv- able potencies that manifest in multifarious ways. This is a sim- ple fact, and yet, without acknowledging it, Absolute Reality can- not be comprehended. Because Advaitavadīs cannot accommodate this fact, they are forced to manufacture complicated definitions. Instead of accepting inconceivable power (acintya-sakti), they are forced to accept a power that simply defies description (anirvacaniyā māyā), which is a convenient way not to have to adequately account for it. This strategy of theirs is itself inconceivable (acintya).

Śri Bhagavat Sandarbha 
Gen Advaitavādīs also propose that both Isvara and jīva are products of māyā and, at the absolute level, there is only formless, unqualified Brahman. Vidyaranya Svāmī states in his famous work Pañcadaśī: 
sed as 
نجاء 
Both jiva and Iśvara are the two calves of maya, the cow that grants all desires. Let them drink the milk of dualism to their fill, but Real- ity is most certainly nondual. (Pañcadasi 6.236)13 
PA The Absolute Person, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, however, does not agree with such definitions of maya, claiming, rather, that māyā is under His support. In SB 11.11.3 cited by Śri Jīva, Kṛṣṇa states that maya is His energy (mayayā me) and that it is beginningless (adye). Śrī Brahmā also confirms this in the Second Canto, "The Lord is the support of both the vidya and avidya features of maya" (yad avidya ca vidya ca purusas tūbhayasrayaḥ, SB 2.6.20).ORG 
The existence of an entity that can influence Brahman to turn into Ïśvara and jīva is impossible as well as inconceivable. We cannot invent a new category different from existence and non-existence (sat and asat). Kṛṣṇa Himself states in Bhagavad Gita that there is either sat or asat; there is no third category, as speculated by the 
sat monists: 
The unreal (asat) has no existence and the real (sat) has no non- Joexistence. The conclusion about both of these has been seen by the 
theknowers of Truth. (GITA 2.16)oys a doua pol moanser Ev 
ها 
This definition of māyā also invalidates the Sākta philosophy. The Śāktas consider Śakti or Devi, who has various forms, to be the supreme controller. She is the mula-prakṛti, original nature, and divides herself into puruşa and prakṛti. She is maha-māyā, who cre- ates Visņu, Śiva and Brahma out of herself and enables them to per- form their respective duties. In her ultimate feature, she is nir- guna and called Parabrahman. There are various branches of the Śāktas, and they have various types of practices for attaining their goal, which is described in scriptures like Devi-bhāgavata Purana, Kularṇava-tantra, Rudra-yamala-tantra, Spanda-kärikā, Tantrāloka,

and so on. In Skanda Purana, Narada Muni describes the glories of

Bhagavati, or the Supreme Goddess, is eternal and has a transcen- dental form. She pervades the whole cosmos and there is nothing superior to Her. (Devi-bhagavata-māhātmya 2.36)14mga tem 
In Sections 17-19 of Tattva Sandarbha, Jīva Gosvāmī established after careful analysis that among all the Puranas, Srimad Bhaga- vatam is the amala (spotless) purana, the saram ekam, the cream of Vedic knowledge. The various Puranas are categorized as belonging, six each, to sattva, rajas and tamas, respectively. Yet Srimad Bhāga- vatam is of the nature of visuddha-sattva ("pure sattva," free from the gunas); hence, the most complete and uncompromising in its disclo- sure of the Absolute. Skanda Purana and Siva Purana conceal Reality, glorifying secondary deities for the benefit of those in lower gunas. Therefore, verses that depict Devi (or the goddess of the external potency) as Absolute cannot be accepted as representing the conclu- sions of nirguna truth. If, however, we take the statements at face value, then the names Devi or Bhagavati, in such verses, refer to the consort of Bhagavan (the Goddess of the internal potency). 
On the contrary, Śrimad Bhagavatam clearly indicates that māyā cannot exist without the support of Śrī Kṛṣṇa. She cannot even face Him (māyā paraity abhimukhe ca vilajjamānā, SB 2.7.47). In GĪTĀ 7.14, Kṛṣṇa says, "Māyā is My divine material energy." Since Bhagavad Gītā is accepted as authoritative even by the Sankaraites, certainly the claim of the Śāktas is not supported by the prasthana-trayi, the three sources of scriptural authority, which are accepted by all Vedic philosophers. 
Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī says that maya can be subdivided into two cat- egories based on her functions. The two examples in the principal verse (SB 2.9.32) indicate these two aspects. The first is called jiva- māyā, the feature of maya that covers the living being's true nature, or svarupa. He also uses the term nimittämśa (efficient or instrumen- tal aspect), to refer to this subdivision due to its being instrumental 
ya sa bhagavati nitya saccidananda-rūpiņi 
parat paratară devi yaya vyaptam idam jagat 
181 
Śrī Bhagavat Sandarbha 
in covering the living being with ignorance. But it is not sufficient to cover consciousness, or the nature of the living being. To per- fect the self's bondage, māyā must also provide the material body, senses and sense objects for the jiva's enjoyment. This is called guna- māyā, because all this paraphernalia is a transformation of the gunas of maya. The guna-māyā feature is also called upadana, or the mate- rial aspect, because it supplies the material ingredients. Just as when a man goes to a nightclub, he first gets intoxicated, which covers his intelligence (like jiva-maya); then he gets allured by the sense objects, such as a young woman (comparable to guṇa-māyā). That makes his illusion complete. In this way, the attack of māyā is twofold - internal and external. The two features complement and strengthen each other. Thus, it is impossible for a conditioned being to get out of her clutches without assistance from beyond the gunas. Although mayä is real and this world manifested by her is also real, the bondage of the jiva is not real. Otherwise, there would be no pos- sibility of liberation. This is confirmed in Śrī Kṛṣṇa's teachings to Uddhava: 
sidad 
to suole 
Śrī Kṛṣṇa says, "My dear Uddhava, due to the influence of the mate- morial gunas of nature, the living being is sometimes designated as con-03 
ditioned and sometimes as liberated, though, in reality, he is never 926really conditioned or liberated. Since I am the supreme Lord of 163 
maya, which is the cause of the gunas of nature, I am never to be i boyconsidered liberated or in bondage." (SB 11.11.1)15 
May 
These two aspects of maya are further indicated by Jvara in his prayers to Śri Krsna: 
Time, fate, karma, the jiva and its propensities, the subtle material elements, the material body, the vital-force, egotism, the various senses and the totality of these are reflected in the living being's sub- tle body. All this constitutes Your material energy, maya, and is an Sendless cycle, like that of seed and plant. I take shelter of You, they 
negation of maya. (SB 10.63.26)16

182 
18 Maya's Two Divisions 
In this verse, time, fate, karma and the jiva" and his propensities form the jiva-māyā, and the rest of the elements constitute the guna- māyā. 
The Lord says (in the principal verse) that whatever is experi- enced in His absence is māyā. This means that a living being experi- ences māyā precisely in all those moments when, in the perception of what is, he or she fails to witness the nondual Absolute as ground and support for both seer and seen. This dualistic perception, which represents the normal or average range of human functioning, rein- forces the sense of a separate self, staring out at a separated world. Sage Kavi further describes this to King Nimi: vozu no anyth 
A living being who is set apart from the Supreme Lord becomes absorbed in separativeness. As a consequence, he is overpowered by fear, his conception of being is reversed and he becomes forget- Bful of his constitutional position. All this takes place by Bhagavan's 
its 
external energy. Therefore, one who is actually wise worships Bha- so gavan by the process of unalloyed devotion, considering his wisdom- 
teacher as an embodiment of the Divine and as the source of life180 
This absorption of the living beings in separativeness (dvitīyā, “in the perception of the secondary," i.e., māyā, devoid of reference to the primary, or God), is the cause of their bondage, and thus the jīvas are called nitya-baddha or anãdi-baddha. Nobody can trace the begin- ning of this conditioning. When by good fortune the living being sur- renders to a sad-guru, or a wisdom-teacher who embodies truth, this bondage is cut. Fear is ultimately not of māyā, but of absorption in separativeness. If one is absorbed in devotion, then māyā can do no harm, though one continues to live in the material world. Therefore, the material world needn't be renounced; consciousness, however, must be reoriented - the field of absorption must change.

Śri Bhagavat Sandarbha 
The jiva-māyā feature can be further classified into two divisions, vidya and avidyä. This has also been explained in SB 11.11.3,9 as cited in Jiva Gosvāmi's text. Vidya is the gateway to liberation, while avidya leads to bondage. The jiva-māyā and guṇa-māyā potencies work in coordination to create and perpetuate the state of bondage. The essence is that guṇa-māyā creates the upadhis, or material desig- nations, and then, owing to the ignorance caused by jiva-māyā, the jiva identifies with them. The result is bondage in illusion. When the jiva understands his real nature and surrenders to a genuine wisdom-teacher, who is a servant of Bhagavan, he is freed from this adhyāsa, or illusory superimposition. It adashdi va gaz 9868 BW This understanding refutes the impersonal theory that the jiva comes about by the reflection of consciousness into inert matter, which in effect means that the jiva has no factual existence. 
In the verse of the Catuh-sloki that defines māyā, the Lord gives two examples to illustrate the covering and deluding aspects of māyā. The first is that of light reflected into darkness. A reflection cannot occur without the light source, nor can it occur within the source; moreover, it cannot be perceived while perceiving the source. Yet to perceive the reflection, we need eyes, which work on the principle of light. If a powerful light shines into one's eyes, the vision will be distorted. It is not possible to see the source of light. This is the func- tion of jiva-māyā - to cover the vision of the living being so that the act of perception, and hence, the perceiver, is oriented toward the reflection, not the Source. This is also called abhāsa and chāyā. 
29b097 
When the eyes are dazzled, one sees colors, caused by the reflected light, that appear to take various shapes. This effect is the guṇa-māyā feature - to delude the living being. This polychromatic effect is referred to by the word tamas, because it is like darkness. Just as in darkness one cannot see things, similarly, when a powerful light is flashed before the eyes, one's vision is blurred and one sees diverse colors. One does not see objects present as they are. This is the commonality between darkness and the diverse colors created by intense light. Therefore, both are called tamas. 
19 This verse is further explained in greater detail in Paramātma Sandarbha, 
Anuccheda 53. 
184 
18 Maya's Two Divisions 
So far, Jiva Gosvāmi has interpreted the two examples in the verse as indicating two distinct divisions of māyā. Alternatively, he says that reflection and darkness may be taken as independent exam- ples, both describing māyā (without reference to its two divisions). In that case, reflection is understood as above (as distortion in the act of perception), while darkness is explained as follows. Darkness can- not be found in the source or presence of light; yet, it is dependent on light because darkness is nothing but absence of light. Further- more, it is perceived with the help of light, or in other words with the eyes, which are designed to perceive light. 
Māyā, although the energy of Bhagavan, is external to, or apart from, His internal nature. She is like the skin of a snake just before it is shed. It is dependent and supported by the snake and grows from its body, yet is inert and external to it. The defects of this shed skin do not reflect in the being of the snake. Hence, it is neither one with nor different from the snake. It is not one because the snake sheds it and still exists as before, without any feeling of loss. It is not different because it cannot grow independent of the snake. 
In conclusion, māyā is an inert potency of Bhagavan. It is sepa- rate from Him, yet not independent. Although inferior, apară, to the jīvas, who are para or superior, māyā nevertheless covers their wis- dom by its inconceivable power and engrosses them in sensual enjoy- ment by supplying them with a material body, senses and sense objects. It is real and thus eternal, yet it undergoes incessant muta- tion and has a personal form called Devi or Durgā. 
Śrī Jiva further supports the use of these terms by referring to Padma Purana, which describes the different appearances of jiva- māyā and guṇa-māyā energies and confirms that one can get free from their influence only by taking shelter of the Supreme Lord. 
The word māyā is also used to indicate yoga-māyā, which is a manifestation of Bhagavan's internal potency. This should be noted. Sometimes the external energy is called maha-māyā to distinguish it from yoga-māyā. Whereas, maha-māyā is an energy that operates prior to the state of liberation, covering knowledge so that Reality remains unperceived, yoga-māyā is an energy that operates post- liberation. It covers the exclusively reverential disposition toward 
185 
Śri Bhagavat Sandarbha 
the Supreme Reality, so that the same Reality can be perceived in the most intimate of terms. Yoga-māyā thus acts favorably to enable liberated beings to participate in intimate pastimes with Bhagavan without feelings of awe and reverence. Feelings of awe and rever- ence create a distance between master and servant. Such distance is not conducive to affectionate intimacy. Yoga-maya, however, being the internal potency of the Lord, accommodates the pleasure of Bha- gavan. Thus, liberated persons who are eligible are favored by the over-shadowing of "majestic-awareness," so they can enjoy loving intimacy, free of awe and reverence. The understanding of maha- māyā will help one to understand yoga-māyā. dgonile vDM

NOW, THE INTERNAL ENERGY, which is of the nature of His essential being and thus called svarupa-bhūta, is described as the source behind all action, by the logic of there being no other possibility (anyatha-anupapattya), in the following two verses spoken by Narada to Citraketu:

I bow down to Him who cannot be contacted or known by the mind, by intellect, by the sense faculties or by the life-force, though He pervades within and without like the sky. The body, senses, life-force, mind and intellect, although matter, can engage in action only when infused with a particle of the Sup- ereme Brahman, and not otherwise, any more than iron can burn without having been heated by fire. Where [this infusion of the body-mind occurs, the jiva] acquires the name of "seer." (SB 6.16.23-24)1

Śridhara Svāmi comments: "I bow down to that Brahman, which the life-force cannot contact by its power of action nor the mind and psyche know by their cognitive power, even though this Brah- man is all-pervasive like the sky. [In the second verse, Nārada] explains the reason for this inability. 'Infused with a particle of the Supreme Brahman,' i.e., filled with a fraction of His conscious energy, the body, senses and so on can engage in their respec- tive fields of action while in the waking and dreaming states, but 'not otherwise,' i.e., not in the states of unconsciousness and deep sleep, 'any more than iron can burn without having been heated by fire.' Iron in its normal state cannot burn, but when heated, acquires burning power from the fire; nevertheless, it cannot burn the fire itself. Similarly, though the body and senses per- form their respective functions by the knowledge and working potencies of Brahman, they cannot approach or know it."

In this regard, while refuting a Sankhya doctrine in his commen- tary on Vedānta-sūtra, Sankarācārya also writes : “Then again [one should consider that] pradhana is imparted with seership by the power of the witness [i.e., the purusa], just as a piece of iron acquires the ability to burn from fire. As such, that which is the cause of pradhāna's seership is certainly the all-cognizant, prin- cipal source of the cosmos” [vs 1.1.15].

This is confirmed in the Śrutis, "All this shines after His bril- liance" (KU 2.2.15), "If Brahman, the personification of bliss, were not in the sky or in the heart, who else would infuse action and maintain the vital-force" (TU 2.7.1)?3 "He is the seeing power of the eye and the hearing capacity of the ear" (BAU 4.4.18).*

Śrīdhara Svāmi's commentary on the last line of the second Bha- gavatam verse under discussion reads as follows: "Just because the jiva is imparted with the power of seership, does it make him a knower of all things? The verse answers in the negative. 'Where this happens,' i.e., in the waking and dreaming states, 'he acquires the designation of seer.' In truth, the title of 'Seer' applies to no one other than Brahman, not even the jiva. This is confirmed in the Śruti, 'Besides Him, there is no other seer' (BAU 3.7.23). An alternate meaning is that Paramātmā knows the jiva who bears the designation of 'seer,' but the jiva does not know Him." 
तदुक्तम् “त्रितयं तत्र यो वेद स आत्मा स्वाश्रयाश्रयः” (भा० २।१०।९) इति । श्रुतौ च जीवो नामातोऽन्यः स्वयं सिद्धो नास्ति परन्तु तदात्मक एवेत्यर्थः । तथातोऽन्यो द्रष्टा नास्ति सर्व- द्रष्टुस्तस्यापरो द्रष्टा नास्तीत्यर्थ इति व्याख्येयम् ॥ श्रीनारदश्चित्रकेतुम् ॥ 
Therefore, Śrimad Bhagavatam states, "The one who knows these three is the Supreme Self, who is His own support and the basis of everything" (SB 2.10.9). In the text of Bṛhad-aranyaka Upanisad cited at the end of Sridhara Svami's commentary (BAU 3.7.23), it is shown that the jiva is not an independent, self-existing entity. It

IN SECTION 17, ŚRILA JĪVA GOSVĀMĪ SAID that prior to explaining the internal potency, he would first explain the external energy. Then in Section 18, he defined māyā as dependent on Bhagavan and estab- lished how she cannot function independently. In this anuccheda, he explains more explicitly how action in the material world ultimately emanates from Bhagavan, and more specifically, from His internal potency. To establish that all action originates from the internal potency, Jiva Gosvāmī cites two verses of Bhāgavatam that Narada Muni spoke to King Citraketu. The first of these explains that both the working (conative) and cognitive senses are unable to perceive the Lord. This is because they lack the capacity to know Him, not because He is too far away. To illustrate this, the first verse says that Bhagavan is all-pervading like the sky, and yet impalpable to the senses. The sky can be perceived through its quality of sound and its granting space to objects, but not so with the Lord. 
The second verse explains the cause of the body and sense inabil- ity. The body and senses are inert by nature, being products of guna- māyā. An inert object has no capacity to perceive anything. But when the living being extends consciousness into the inert body and senses, which include the mind, they can function and perceive their respective sense objects. The proof of this is that, during an uncon- scious state or in deep sleep, the senses do not perceive their respec- tive objects. A sleeping man is as good as dead as far as external sense awareness is concerned. That is why it is sometimes said, “Sleep is an image of death." This is because in deep sleep or in an unconscious state the living entity loses contact with the senses. 
Therefore, by direct and indirect inference, it is logical to con- clude that the senses acquire their functional capacity from the 
19019 The Internal Energy Is the Source of All Action 
living being, who is dependent upon God. Nevertheless, even when surcharged by the potency of the living being, they cannot approach Him. This is illustrated by the example of an iron rod, which has no natural capacity to burn, but can do so when infused with heat. Still, it can never exceed the heat of its source. This is what Śrīdhara Svāmī means when he says, "It cannot burn the fire itself." A hot iron can heat a cold object by its acquired heat, but the iron can never heat its own source. In the same way, the material senses cannot know the conscious being or Bhagavan. Yet, one may ques- tion, "If the jiva is a conscious seer, why can't he know God?" Nārada replies that the jiva is also limited in its capacities and is an atomic fraction of Bhagavan's intermediary energy. Krsna says, "The living beings in this material world are verily My eternal integrated parts." (mamaivāmśo jiva-loke jiva-bhutaḥ sanatanah, GĪTĀ 15.7). Just as the senses and body derive their energy from the self, the self in turn receives its energy from Kṛṣṇa. 
The statement, "My integrated parts," does not mean that the ātmās are chipped off from Bhagavan's body like stone pieces, but that they are distinct parts of the integrated Whole that He is. Just as parts are dependent on the whole and are meant to serve the whole, so also the jivas are dependent on the Lord and are His servants of the Lord. A part loses the purpose for which it exists if separated from the whole. The jivas, however, being eternal parts of the Supreme Whole, can never be separated from Him; they exist always in Him. It is only the illusion of being a separate self in a separated world that causes them to become engrossed in matter. Consequently, they forget their true identity and miss the completion and connection available, moment to moment, through service of Bhagavan. 
The jiva is not an independent seer. Although he is a seer during the waking and dreaming states, he cannot see anything during deep sleep. He does not lose the power to see, he simply does not see: 꿈이 
[In deep sleep,] he certainly does not see. [That is to say,] though 
seeing, he does not see visible objects, although his capacity to see is not lost. (BAU 4.3.23)7

dotA ILAJ Śri Bhagavat Sandarbhad 
But the living being's seeing is under the control of the Lord. Śri Jiva corroborates this with several Upanisadic statements like, "He is the seeing power of the eye and the hearing capacity of the ear," and, "All this shines after His brilliance." Thus, Bhagavan is the original Seer, and by His power the living entity can also see. vanill 
Мне od In Sections 58-59 of Tattva Sandarbha, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi estab- lished that Bhagavan is the ultimate support. Although the jiva (adhyatmika-purusa), the body (adhibhautika-purusa), and the pre- siding deities of the senses (adhidaivika-puruşa) can also act as mutual supports, Bhagavan is the support of everyone, including Himself. Thus, He is the absolute aśraya, or support. The jiva and the material energy both function by His power. Śrī Kṛṣṇa confirms 
this: 
The splendor of the sun, which dissipates the darkness of this whole world, comes from Me. And the splendor of the moon and of fire are also from Me. (GĪTĀ 15.12) 
Kṛṣṇa gives a brief list of His opulences in chapter 10 of Bhagavad Gitā and then concludes: 
da no 
But what need is there, Arjuna, for all this detailed knowledge? With a single fragment of Myself, I pervade and support this entire od Cosmos. (GĪTĀ 10.42)

Fly In regard to living beings, Kṛṣṇa says, "I am seated in everyone's heart and from Me come remembrance, knowledge and forgetful- ness" (sarvasya caham hrdi sannivisto mattaḥ smṛtir jñānam apohanaṁ ca, GĪTĀ 15.15). The words smṛti, jñāna and apohana can also refer to the three states of dreaming, waking and deep sleep, respectively. Dreaming is nothing, but seeing what one has experienced, involv- ing the faculty of remembrance, or smrti. Jñana is appropriate aware- ness of the world, as in the waking state, and apohana means the loss

of knowledge, signifying deep sleep, wherein one loses contact with sense perception as well as with memory. Śrī Bhagavan says that all three states are under His control; they come from Him. Bṛhad- aranyaka Upanisad thus rightly says nanyo'to'sti draṣṭā, "Besides Him, there is no other seer" (BAU 3.7.23).shasan bilay he 
61 The essence of all this is that the jiva is not a self-existent entity. He is a seer, but his seeing power is dependent on the All-Seer, the Lord, as confirmed by Vedanta-sutra, "The actions of the self depend on the transcendental Lord, as is said in the Śrutis" (parāt tu tac chruteḥ, vs 2.3.39). The Śruti being referred to in this sūtra is Bṛhad-aranyaka Upanisad, "Who controls all beings from within" (BAU 3.7.15)10 10 Ping sift no ofis ueridos bi 
Although the jiva dwells in the body even during deep sleep, he cannot perceive either the subtle or gross bodies. In fact, he is depen- dent on Paramātmā to return him to the waking state from deep slumber. This can be demonstrated logically. When one is in deep sleep, he cannot hear his name being called. One must be awake in order to respond. Then how does one wake up when called? There must be a third party to help one reach external consciousness. This party must have the power to reach the sleeping self as well as to hear the call. This can be performed only by Paramātmā, who "pervades within and without, like the sky," as the first verse under discussion says (antar bahis ca vitatam vyomavat). Because the three states of the jiva are dependent on Bhagavan, it is established that all func- tions of material nature, as well as of the living being, are dependent on the internal potency. 
This conclusion specifically counters the Sankhya philosophy of Kapila Muni. There are two Kapila Munis, both of whom propagated a system of philosophy called Sankhya. The one described in Śrimad Bhāgavatam was an avatara of God, fifth of the twenty-two avatāras listed in chapter 3 of the First Canto. This Kapila gave His teachings to Asuri and to His mother Devahuti. The other Kapila Muni prop- agated similar Sänkhya doctrines related to the enumeration of the different material elements, prakṛti and puruşa, and so on, but his conclusions differ from those of Srimad Bhagavatam. He compiled 
10

193 
HOA AŚrī Bhagavat Sandarbha 
his philosophy into 526 aphorisms divided into six chapters called Sänkhya-sutra. He too had a disciple named Asuri. bring ganse 
This Kapila's doctrine is dualistic, in which the purusa (the con- scious living being) and prakṛti (material nature) are two indepen- dent eternal realities. Insentient prakṛti, or pradhana, is the inde- pendent cause of the world. Pradhana creates the world in order to give release to the conditioned beings. Although insentient, it cre- ates the world, just as insentient milk turns into yogurt of its own accord. How can an insentient object work for the welfare of a sen- tient being? Kapila's answer is that it does so automatically, just as a mother's breast fills with milk for the nourishment of her baby on its birth. There is no conscious effort on the part of the mother; it is all nature's arrangement. vbod odt at 
With respect to the agency of material nature, this is confirmed in Bhagavad Gita, which also condemns the person who thinks himself to be the doer: 50 651cnomab

The self, bewildered by the influence of material ego, thinks himself the doer of activities that are in actuality carried out by the three gunas of material nature. (GITA 3.27)11 quart of veg burd

In Kapila's view, prakṛti is beginningless, unending and all- pervading. It is the root cause and has no underlying cause. Sankhya- sūtra states: isnt seed (1ovemore mointiv

to Purușa, on the other hand, has no attributes and is all-pervading consciousness. There is a separate puruşa in every body. This is sup- ported by Iśvara Kṛṣṇa, a follower of Kapila Muni, in his Sankhya- kärikā: ow

different attributes, it is established that there are many purusas. sid (Sankhya-kärikā 18)13: 
The Sankhya philosophers say the pure self is inactive, under- goes no modification and is thus without enjoyment. Suffering and enjoyment belong to material nature. When prakṛti and puruşa come together, their association produces a mutual interchange of qual- ities. Consciousness and agency appear in matter, and enjoyment appears in spirit. This is called adhyāsa, superimposition, and is the cause of the purusa's bondage. 
sdi 
The Sankhya philosophers compare prakṛti to a blind woman and puruşa to a lame man. The lame man rides on the shoulders of the blind woman and thus do they move. In this way, the material world is functioning through the combination of these two. If, however, the puruşa can understand, and thus see beyond, the twenty-four ele- ments of material nature, realizing the self as distinct from them, then liberation becomes a reality. The analogy is given of a man learning of a woman's unchaste behavior: when this happens, she shies away from him. Similarly, when the puruşa learns about the countless mutations of prakṛti, she flees from him. bezahliwed 
This philosophy, though intriguing, is possessed of faulty logic and is certainly not supported by scriptures. The very fact that mate- rial nature cannot produce anything without the association of the puruşa proves that prakṛti is not the ultimate cause of the creation. It is common experience that an insentient object (prakṛti) cannot be an independent agent. It can only serve as a tool in the hands of a sentient being (puruşa). 
itnes sdt to exsilew sdi nol dow The Sankhya followers further come to the faulty conclusion that the puruşa cannot be an agent because he cannot work without prakṛti. This is tantamount to saying that because a man cannot write without a pen, the pen, and not he, is the writer. He may not be able to write without a pen, but the capacity to do so is within him and not in the pen. But by Sankhya logic, the pen is the writer. That their philosophy is not supported by scriptures is shown by

the reference in this anuccheda to Narada's teachings to King Cit- raketu. Śrīla Vyāsa has strongly refuted the dualistic Sankhya in his Vedanta-sutra, especially in the second pada of the Second Chapter. For example, vs 2.2.1 states, "The pradhana, which is inferred from the existence of the world, is not the cause of the world, because it is impossible for it to create by itself."14 
GĪTĀ 3.27, quoted above, teaches that one should not consider oneself the doer, or the exclusive cause of any action. It is not that the self has no responsibility for his actions, but it is not the exclu- sive, or even the primary, cause. 
In GĪTĀ 18.14, Kṛṣṇa explains that there are five factors of action. The jiva is included as only one of the five. In the phrase kartāham iti manyate (GĪTĀ 3.27), the verb manyate (thinks) is used. This implies that the self is a doer, because thinking is mental work. In GĪTĀ 18.15 as well, Kṛṣṇa accepts that work includes actions performed by the mind when he says, "whatever work a man performs with his body, speech or mind." The problem arises when a person thinks him- self to be the only doer, forgetting the help extended by the Lord and the external energy. It is then that he is condemned as foolish and bewildered. 
mori 2991 sri pling to anottarin sinuos 
It would be wrong, however, to conclude that the jiva does noth- ing at all. This is also the significance of the mantra BAU 4.3.23 quoted above, in which it was said that the seeing capacity of the seer is not lost even in deep sleep. The jiva has the capacity to desire, and is hence one of the five causes of action (karma-hetavah).

The Sankhyaites cannot explain why insentient prakṛti should work for the welfare of the sentient purușa. The flow of milk in a mother's breast is not exclusively the act of prakṛti, since no such action occurs in a dead body. It happens after the birth of a child because it is needed at that time, and not before. If the child dies after birth, there should be no milk in the mother's breast, accord- ing to Sankhya logic, but such is not the case. But neither does the mother have any real control over the flow of milk. Therefore, we have to accept that neither prakṛti nor the individual living being are

in control, but that there is a higher controlling authority governing such phenomena. 
It is by the power of Bhagavan that prakṛti and her products acquire the energy to execute their functions. This has been exem- plified by the iron rod's burning capacity, when acquired from fire. Both the potency of action (kriya-sakti) and the cognitive power (jñāna-śakti) belong to the Lord and not to prakṛti. 
Now that Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi has denied prakṛti any indepen- dent existence, he will extend the discussion further, in the next anuccheda, to say that the jiva too cannot independently know the material gunas.

the tan-matras, or the subtle elements [form, taste, smell, sound and touch]. None of these know ātmānam (themselves), i.e., their own nature; anya, i.e., the respective field of operations of each one; or para, i.e., the gods who are beyond these last two.

The living being, however, is aware of all of the above, namely his own true nature and the other (anya), i.e., the knower [as a con- ditioned being]. Besides this, he is aware of the conglomeration of matter, energy and mind, in the form of the body, vital-force, the psyche and so on, as well as the deities [or personified cosmic intelligences] that preside over all of these. He also knows the gunas of nature, beginning with sattva, which constitute the body and the rest. While aware of all this, he does not know the omni- scient Supreme Person, who is the knower of everything, begin- ning from the body up to the jiva. I (Dakṣa) worship Him, who has unfathomable energy in His essential nature. As is stated in the First Canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, "He is called Ananta, unlim- ited, because He possesses unlimited qualities" (SB 1.18.19).20

A similar explanation is given in Bṛhad-aranyaka Upanisad, beginning with mantra BAU 2.4.14, "When the jiva conceives of himself as different from the Lord, he then perceives things other than the Lord." After declaring the jiva to be a seer of other objects, it is denied that he can see Bhagavan: "When everything is viewed as the self, then who can be the seer and what will be the seen?" After this, it is stated that Paramātmā is the knower of everything, including Himself, and finally it is said, "Then, O Maitreyi, by what means can the Knower be known?"3

Simeon baino 10] ashish si es llaw as no os bra odayag ads The implication of the above discussion is as follows: There is apparent duality in the realm of maya. The jiva emanates from the Supreme and so is nondifferent from Him; even so, by the inconceivable potency called māyā, the jiva appears inert, impure, perishable and distinct from the Supreme. Therefore, he considers himself to be independent and takes birth repeatedly. In this state, the living being sees objects other than the Lord, because his senses and the sense objects are mutually suited to co-exist as perceiver and perceived.

the sun orb, exists "as everything," by His internal potency. He exists in this way without beginning and not due to entering into the jiva. In this state, by what sensory instrument would the jiva see, and what would it see? Not by any instrument would it see, and so it would not perceive anything. The sun's rays cannot illu- minate the effulgence inside the sun orb, nor can a flame burn its source, fire. Since Bhagavan's unlimited opulence is such, then by which sense faculty can that all-cognizant knower, the Lord, be known? Not by any. In this way, the cognitive potency is estab- lished in Him. This indicates that the potency to act and that of volition also exist in Him. 
Commentary 
IN THIS SECTION, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī explains that Bhagavan's inter- nal energy is the fountainhead of all cognition. He gives evidence from the Hamsa-guhya prayers of Dakṣa Mahārāja. The quoted verse explains that the working and cognitive senses can know neither themselves nor the living being, because by constitution they are inert instruments. A spoon transports food from plate to mouth, but does not taste; it serves only as an instrument. 
Similarly, the senses are instruments that assist the jiva in the work of perception, but have no such power of their own. The jiva is conscious by nature and superior to the inert senses and body. The senses function after being energized by the jiva, but have no power to perceive themselves or the jiva. Ritor 
The same analogy is further extended to the jiva and Bhagavan. With proper deliberation and discrimination, the jiva can under- stand the senses, body, mind and the gunas of nature, though not completely. It can also understand itself as different from them and conscious by nature. Śrī Jiva comments that in relation to the jiva the word ātmā refers to the pure self (sva-svarupa) and anya refers to its conditioned state. An enlightened being can understand these two states along with the senses, body, mind and the gunas; yet, it cannot understand God. Exalted living beings, like Brahmā, have 
201 
Śri Bhagavat Sandarbha 
knowledge and intelligence far superior to ordinary mortals of this world, yet their intelligence fails to reach to the Lord. antendo 
Just as the senses, body and mind function, being inspired by the ātmā, the ātmā functions because it is energized by the Lord. Just as the senses, body and mind cannot know the ātmā, the ātmā cannot know God. A living being can understand that it is not the creator of the cosmos and the objects within it. By seeing the harmony in nature, one can guess that there is a Supreme Being, but where does one go from there? 
ew aids nl syne vd to Sawom 20 In commenting on this verse, Śrīla Viśvanatha Cakravartipāda writes, "Although the conscious jiva perceives material objects, it is unconscious in perceiving Bhagavan" (sarvatra cetano'pi parames- vare tv acetana eva). This means that the jiva is unable to perceive Bhagavan by his own cognitive power. Although consciousness is the basic requirement for cognition, it is not sufficient - Bhagavan's grace is also necessary. No one can know the Lord without His mercy. The jiva is covered by the veil of māyā. In GĪTĀ 7.26, Kṛṣṇa explains that although He knows past, present and future, no one knows Him. He can be known only by pure devotion, bhaktyāham ekaya grahyaḥ (SB 11.14.21): 
ind infuomes 
be Śrī Kṛṣṇa's name, form, qualities and pastimes cannot be uttered or by grasped by way of the material senses. Only when the mind and 
senses are transmuted through unalloyed devotion, do the name, form and so on, manifest of their own volition, on the tongue or other senses. (BRS 1.2.234) 
19f 
This service begins with the tongue. By uttering the Holy Names of God, and by tasting the remnants of foodstuffs offered to Him, the inert senses are transmuted, just as a cold piece of iron, when placed in contiguity with fire, acquires the characteristics of fire. It gives off light, and if you touch it, it will burn you. Dedication of the senses in the transcendental name, fame, qualities and līlā (divine play) of Bhagavan, makes possible the gradual pervasion and transformation of the blunt material senses, by the internal potency.

20 The Jiva Is Dependent on Bhagavan for His Power of Cognition 
Thus, the Lord reveals Himself to those who take shelter of this process. 15ologe well 
Further, the consciousness of the living being is not always in its normal state. It can be covered by jiva-māyā, as was explained in Anuccheda 16.4. When the consciousness of the living being is covered, he or she is bewildered and cannot properly understand even material nature (ajñānenävṛtam jñānam tena muhyanti jantavaḥ, GĪTĀ 5.15). 
Even if a living being is blessed by Bhagavan, he cannot under- stand Him completely. Dakṣa Mahārāja reasons that this is because the Lord is unlimited and infinite, ananta. There is no end to His attributes. The jiva is finite. The finite can never completely know the infinite. This is confirmed in the Śruti, "Even a person who could count all the dust particles in the cosmos cannot assimilate the glories of Śrī Vişnu" (Nārāyaṇa-pūrva-tapani Upanisad 4.4)5 
For this reason Bhagavan is called Ananta. It is not that only ordinary jīvas cannot understand Him, but even highly elevated per- sons, like Brahma and Śiva, cannot fathom His glories. Therefore, the Śrutis personified prayed: 
Because You are without end or limit, the cosmic administrators [such as Brahma] simply cannot find any limit to You. Moreover, biceven You cannot do so. Under the influence of time, the countless Ho universes, each enveloped in its own seven-layered covering, float a contemporaneously within You, like particles of dust in the sky. se For this reason, we Śrutis, whose final conclusion is in You alone,on become successful by revealing You indirectly, through the method of negating everything that is not You. (SB 10.87.41) 
bus 
Actually, even the infinite Lord cannot know Himself fully; otherwise, He would defy the very definition of the infinite.

To further explain Dakṣa's verse, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi quotes parts of the mantra BAU 2.4.14, which Yajnavalkya spoke to his wife, Maitreyi. The complete mantra reads as follows: 
When the self is bound in the material world, there arises the notion of duality. Then the jiva sees something, smells something, hears something, speaks something, thinks something, and knows some- thing. When He is situated in the Self and everything is a manifes- tation of the Lord, then what would he smell and with what? What 95 would he see and with what? What would he hear and with what? 620 What would he think and with what? And what would he know and with what? With what can one know Him, because of whom, all this is known? O Maitreyi, by what means can the Knower be known? 
The Advaitavādīs interpret this mantra in the following way. They say that the first part refers to the conditioned state in which there is apparent duality, but in reality there is only one Brahman. In this state, a conditioned being uses his material senses and mind to perceive material objects. When he is freed from illusion, how- ever, and reinstated as Brahman, no distinction remains between the perceiver, what is perceived, and the act of perceiving. 
Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi approaches this mantra in another way. In the conditioned state, the jiva is forgetful of Krsna and thinks of him- self as an independent enjoyer and thus falls into duality. The word itara (lit., "the other") is used both for the conditioned being as well as material objects. In reality, there is no duality because the jiva is not independent of Krsna and His energies, but under illusion, he considers himself to be an enjoyer and regards material things as objects for his sense gratification. But when he takes to devotion, he is freed of this illusion. He abandons duality and recognizes Kṛṣṇa as the supreme controller and enjoyer. At that time, he does not per- ceive the material world as itara because his consciousness has been

attuned to a higher viewing frequency. He sees the spiritual energy everywhere. He does not have material senses anymore. He under- stands that all actions occur by the potency of Bhagavan and that he is not independent in acquiring knowledge. He knows he is minute, and just as a spark cannot illuminate its source, he understands that he is incapable of knowing the Lord. He knows himself to be a part of Bhagavan's energy, like a ray of the sun. 
The word anădita (without a beginning) is important. The Lord exists in His svarupa-sakti and there is no beginning to this. There- fore, the word abhut in the Upanisad, though in the past tense, car- ries the meaning of the present, bhavann äste: Bhagavan always exists like the sun. In relation to Him, the jiva is an instrument in His hands, and just as the senses cannot know the ātmā, the ātmā cannot know the Lord by its own power. YOSTOT JAHATI 387 
This example has its limits, however, in that a fully surrendered soul is able to know Bhagavan by His mercy. Krsna says, "I give them the wisdom by which they can know Me" (dadami buddhi yogam tam yena mam upayanti te, GĪTĀ 10.10). 
This analysis proves that the Lord has cognitive potency that flows from Him to the living beings. Because He has this potency, He must also have working potency and will power. These three poten- cies always exist together (svābhävikī jñāna-bala-kriyā ca, śʊ 6.8). Knowledge leads to willing, and then to action. We cannot desire something unless we have knowledge of it. When we have knowl- edge about something, then a desire may manifest. We deliberate on it and then decide whether to act on it or not. So, action is always preceded by knowledge and will. Hence, these three always accom- pany each other. They are natural characteristics of a conscious being. lo 9867

In this anuccheda, Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī has shown that Bhagavan's internal potency is the source of the jiva's cognitive power. In the next section, he will further substantiate this by explaining that māyā, the total material energy, is under His control.

Śrīdhara Svāmī interprets sva-dhamna (by Your effulgence) as the Lord's cit (conscious or internal) potency, because of which, Time (kāla) activates māyā. Here the word ātmā refers to the jiva, and its qualities are the gunas - sattva, rajas and tamas. As stated by Śrī Kṛṣṇa, "The gunas of sattva, rajas and tamas belong to the living being and not to Me" (SB 11.25.12)?

IN THE PREVIOUS SECTION it was shown the jiva is not inde- pendent in exercising cognition. This section now explains that all his other actions are controlled by Bhagavan through the agency of māyā. Māyā works under the control of His internal energy, and thus all actions are initiated from the internal potency. In the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam under discussion in this section (SB 7.9.22), Prahlada says that the Lord controls material nature. 
Popular meanings of the word dhama are effulgence or abode. According to Amara-koşa lexicon, however, one of the meanings of the word dhama is influence or power (prabhava), gṛha-deha-tvit- prabhāvā dhāmāni (Amara-koşa 3.3.124). Viśva-prakāśa also confirms this, dhāma saptan prabhāve ca tejo-mandira-janmasu. The word sva- dhāmnā, therefore, here means, "by His own potency," referring to the cit or internal potency, as commented by Śrīdhara Svāmi. Bha- gavan is eternally in control of the gunas of material nature, which influence the living being- nitya-vijitätma-guṇaḥ. 
Ātmā here refers to the conditioned being. He or she is influ- enced by the material gunas, not Bhagavan (guņā jivasya naiva me, SB 11.25.12). When it is said that the gunas belong to the jiva, it means they bind him, not that he owns them. In the material world, every- thing belongs to God. As Kṛṣṇa asserts, "I am the Supreme Lord of all that be" (mama bhūta-maheśvaram, GĪTĀ 9.11); "I am the source of everything" (aham sarvasya prabhavaḥ, GITA 10.8); and, "I am the father of creation" (pitäham asya jagataḥ, GITA 9.17). Even so, living beings still believe that some things belong to them, and thus they become attached and bound to matter. 
The general principle is that when one becomes attached to some- thing, he becomes its slave. God is the real owner, yet He is not attached and thus not bound. The living entity imagines himself the owner and thus becomes bound. When Mother Earth witnesses this, she laughs, having seen powerful emperors, who considered them- selves rulers of the planet, vanish into thin air. In the Twelfth Canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, she speaks the following verse:samin 
ba

Joe Śrī Bhagavat Sandarbha CM 
Although in the past great men and their descendants have left me, ob departing this world in the same helpless way they entered it, foolish shmen even today still try to conquer me. (SB 12.3.6)3 
Ile Fortunately, this bondage is not real, just as the sense of owner- ship is not real. It happens because of the superimposition of the subtle body onto the self. When the living being recognizes the real proprietor and becomes captivated by Him, then the knot of mate- rial attachment is loosened. This can happen only by the mercy of the Lord and His devotees. 
Bhagavan is not touched by the gunas, as was explained in great detail in Anuccheda 10.3. Although He controls them, He impels them to act through His potency of time (kāla), which regulates cause and effect. This function of kala is described by Mother Devaki in her prayer to Kṛṣṇa: 
O Friend of the unmanifest! This creation works under the control dy of powerful time, which is divided into seconds, minutes, hours and years. This element of time, which extends for many millions ofIni years, is but another of Your forms. I take shelter of You, the con- troller of time and the reservoir of all good fortune. (SB 10.3.26)* 
According to Śrīdhara Svāmi, the word visrjya means the mate- rial objects, and visarga, the means used to produce them. Every- thing is under God's control. In this way, all action originates from Him. Śrī Kṛṣṇa affirms this, "All action issues forth from Me" (mattaḥ sarvam pravartate, GITA 10.8).

Commentary loo 
navegarla vd Belavia al EvEM 
IN THE PREVIOUS SECTION it was explained that mayă functions under the Lord's control. Although she is inert, she carries out the functions of creation and so forth. This text explains how inert māyā can perform such acts. 
Mother Earth spoke this verse to Śrī Varaha. She says that the Lord has no purpose in the material creation and it is not meant for His own enjoyment. He has His personal abode where He sports eter- nally with His loving devotees. 
But the question arises that if He has no desire, why does He cre- ate the world? No one acts without a desire. The answer is that He does not desire it for Himself; He desires it for the welfare of the jiva. That is why He glances over the material energy, which results in the successive unfoldment of prakṛti as the cosmos. This is stated in CHU 6.2.3, tad aikṣata bahu syaṁ prajayeyeti. This creation comes about by Bhagavan's glance, and its annihilation takes place when He shuts His eyes. 
A doubt may be raised here. Living beings in the material world are suffering in the cycle of birth and death. How can this be the purpose of creation? Does the Lord enjoy watching the suffering of jīvas? Śrī Śuka answers: drtos nollers] and 
519 The Supreme Lord manifested the material intellect, senses, mind, vi to and vital-force of the living beings so that they could indulge their ow 
desires for sense enjoyment, take repeated births to engage in pur- ni poseful action, become elevated in future lives and, ultimately, to 
attain liberation. (SB 10.87.2)2

Now a further doubt can be raised. If this is the case, why does God not offer an equal opportunity to everyone? Why is it that some enjoy in heaven, while others suffer in hell? The answer is indicated in the phrase, "the witness of the qualities and actions of all beings" (guna-karma-sākṣine). This means that the Lord awards results according to individual karma. He is not biased. Everyone suffers or enjoys the results of his karma. This does not mean that He is impersonal or indifferent, however, nor that He is bound to deliver the results of karma, or that He has no discrimination. He provides knowledge of how to become free from suffering, and He certainly favors His devotees, which is to say that He favors those who are fully receptive and available to Him. When He sees that a person has realized the purpose of creation, Bhagavan takes per- sonal interest in helping her or him. Such a surrendered soul is no longer under the indifferent laws of karma. This, Śrī Kṛṣṇa revealed to Arjuna: 
I am equally disposed to all living beings, and so there is no one whom I despise or favor. But those who worship Me through devo- tion are situated in Me, and I too am established in them. (GĪTĀ 9.29)3 
Another doubt may be raised. Māyā is inert, so how can she create the cosmos? In Bhagavad Gita, Śrī Kṛṣṇa says that He impreg- nates material nature, and then all living beings take birth. He injects the seed. This means that by His potency, inert māyā becomes active. She carries out the functions of creation (udaya), maintenance (sthiti) and dissolution (samyama) by her gunas of rajas, sattva and tamas, respectively. Śrīmad Bhagavatam explains that

Sri Bhagavat Sandarbha 
Bhagavan does not contact māyā personally, but that she is ener- gized or impregnated through proximity to Him, simply by His glance, just as an iron shaving is energized in proximity of a magnet. This is the significance of the word "glance" (ikṣitu, sa aikṣata, etc.). When one glances at an object, he does not personally contact it. The example of a magnet conveys both meanings, i.e., absence of contact and causing movement. An inert piece of iron cannot move by itself. 30 Similarly, māyā is dependent on the energy of Bhagavan to ener- gize her functions. In this manner, the actions of maya are always under the control of, and impelled by, Bhagavan's internal potency. She is not capable of acting independently. This certainly contra- dicts the dualistic Sankhya philosophy of Kapila Muni, who consid- ered material nature to be an independent agent. 
In the following anuccheda Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi further explains how māyā cannot influence Bhagavan. This does not mean that māyā is illusory. She is as real as the other energies of Bhagavan.

LIBERATION (KAIVALYA) is not possible where there is even a tinge of māyā-śakti; and owing to a lack of sense experience in kaivalya, the bliss of kaivalya cannot be an object of experi- ence (arthata). Thus, using the evidence of presumption (an- yathanupapatti-pramāna), the presence of the internal potency in kaivalya is established. Arjuna prays to Kṛṣṇa:

If one then asks, "How can it be possible for one who delights exclusively in the bliss of Self (kevalänubhavananda) to be the perceiver of māyā, in such a way that His nature as Bhagavan remains still intact? Moreover, since as the Supreme Lord He is the presiding deity and administrator of material nature, how can He be free from intercourse with her?"

The reply given in this verse is, "You have cast away the effects of māyā" (māyāṁ vyudasya), i.e., "By Your undeviating internal potency, You keep the shadow-like material energy at bay." Simi- larly, "by this internal potency, You are situated in the liberated state of absolute unity (kaivalya)." 
Commentary 
sily og sis 
bnoyed bol smarque si no laigizo la vitih s IN THE PREVIOUS SECTIONS, it was shown that māyā, inert by nature, is activated by, and functions under the control of, Bhaga- vān's internal energy. This gives rise to the following doubts: If the Lord activates māyā, it must mean that He comes into contact with her. If this is so, how can it be said that He is liberated (kaivalya)? And, since kaivalya is devoid of any experience, because there is nothing to be experienced in the state of absolute unity, how can it be said that He enjoys bliss? The second doubt is raised in view of the impersonal understanding of liberation. szliw

Śrī Jiva Prabhu answers these two questions on the basis of SB 1.7.23, which is the principal verse of this anuccheda. There Arjuna explains that the Lord, although the controller of māyā, is

transcendental to her, and though He is transcendental, He is not without energies. A vom vd bodornu ai névegeta sad awol 
The word kaivalya (lit., "alone-ness" or "that which alone remains when all coverings have been removed") is derived from kevala, which means "only," or "pure." Although this word is gen- erally translated as "liberation" and is understood to mean being nondifferent from Brahman, its real import is "unadulterated," or "free from material contamination." In this sense kaivalya signifies absolute unity, but without denying the existence of Bhagavan's internal energy. The Lord experiences bliss through His internal energy for His own delight. He has no need of the material energy for this purpose. The internal energy is likened to a queen and the external energy to a maidservant. A king does not sport with his maidservant. Because the internal energy is nondifferent from the Lord, He is understood to be situated in kaivalya. du ved a 
Similarly, Bhagavan does not contact māyā, but controls her as a magnet manipulates a piece of iron, without direct contact and with- out any influence of the iron upon the magnet. A magnet has its own internal power with which it can influence a piece of iron outside of itself. A solar machine works by the energy of the sun, yet the sun is neither in contact with the machine directly, nor is it influenced by it. The Lord controls mayã through His expansion, called the Puruşa, or Paramātmā, who is also not touched by maya. 
Sve 
In Arjuna's verse, the words adyaḥ puruṣaḥ refer to the Lord as Bhagavan, while Iśvara means Paramātmā. Both are transcendental to māyā, prakṛteḥ parah. In Bhagavad Gita, Śrī Kṛṣṇa says: all 
Besides the fallible and the infallible, there is another, the greatest person, the Supreme Self, the imperishable Supreme Controller, who has entered the three worlds and is maintaining them. Since I am beyond both the fallible individual self and My infallible man- ifestations as Brahman or Paramātmā, I am known in both the Vedic literature and among the people of the world as Purusottama.

Although the Lord controls māyā, He remains in His svarupa, or internal nature, kaivalye sthita ätmani (SB 1.7.23). This is confirmed in Chandogya Upanisad, "Where is the Lord situated? In His own nature" (sa bhagavaḥ kasmin pratisthitaḥ sve mahimni, CHU 7.24.1). Hence, He is not like an ordinary controller who must remain in contact with the controlled. Moreover, the bliss He enjoys is derived from His internal potency and not from material experience. 
A further doubt may be raised. If the Supreme Lord is transcen- dental and situated in pure bliss, how can He even experience māyā to thus control her? sob anix A revisable of viss Terry 
Arjuna answers this question by saying that He presides over māyā, having subdued her by His cit-sakti. He remains free from māyā, perceiving her through His internal potency. Since inert māyā functions according to certain specifications, we can indi- rectly infer or presume (anyathanupapatti) that the internal potency is what sets māyā in motion. Otherwise, it is not possible to explain the actions of inert māyā. Thus, the answer to the first two doubts raised in this anuccheda proves the existence of the Lord's internal energy. art balls,noinqxs eiH nguori om alon brol an 
Śrīla Viśvanatha Cakravarti, commenting on this same verse, says that prakṛti here denotes māyā and not avidyā. Māyā has two features, vidya and avidya, and the Lord is superior to both. He exists within His internal energy, and because His internal energy is nondifferent from Him, He always remains in the state of kaivalya, or absolute unity. Maya is like a shadow. Just as a shadow is simul- taneously separate from, or outside, its source and yet dependent on it, so too māyā is outside Bhagavan's svarupa and yet functions under His control. This also unravels the Advaitavadīs' proposition that māyā is the only energy, and that the Absolute Truth in its pure state is devoid of potency.

According to the Eleventh Canto, kaivalya is defined as kevalānub- havananda, or the bliss of pure experience:"

The phrase "situated in Your own Self" (ätmani) means situated in Your true identity. In other words, "through Your internal potency, You are experiencing the joy of Your own Self." This is confirmed by the devas in the Sixth Canto, who say, "You Yourself taste the bliss derived from Your own Self" (svayam upalabdha- nija-sukhānubhavo bhavan, SB 6.9.33). The word sandoha (totality) in this verse from the Eleventh Canto reveals that variety (vaic- itri) exists in Him, and this arises exclusively due to the varieties 28 SW (Tom) parāvarānāṁ parama äste kaivalya-sañjñitaḥ kevalänubhavananda-sandoho nirupadhikahdeva (int-above) Translation following Śrīdhara Svami: "For the gods, beginning with Śri Brahma, and for liberated and conditioned beings alike, He exists as the supreme goal, to designated as kaivalya (liberation).

The word prakrti (the material energy) [in the main verse of this anuccheda] refers to the threefold gunas of māyā. Śrīdhara Svāmī has also demonstrated the existence of the three types of energies in the same way. For instance, in her prayers Devahūti states:

By dint of Your own experience, the entire phenomenal world follows You, for You possess Your own independent potency (svacchanda- śakti). (SB 3.24.33)'

[Śrīdhara Svāmi:] "The word para means the Supreme Lord (Parameśvara). Why? Because He has independent potencies (svacchanda-sakti). Devahūti then names those potencies: Prad- hana is the form of material nature; puruşa is the superintendent of pradhana; mahat is the mahat-tattva ('the first evolute of prad- hāna,' or 'the cosmic intellect'); Time is the element that unsettles the above and trivṛta (threefold) is the material ego [being com- posed of the three gunas].

both the cosmos and its maintainer, too. After thus describing Bhagavan in reference to His external energy, māyā, which man- ifests as pradhana and so on, Devahūti next explains how He is beyond the material energy by virtue of His conscious potency. She states this with the words ātmānubhutyanugata-prapañca (by dint of your own experience, the entire phenomenal world fol- lows You). Atmänubhutya (lit., by Your own experience) means by Your internal potency. The entire phenomenal world follows Him, i.e., is dissolved in Him, through His internal potency. The word kavi (wise one) means omniscient. This means that He is the witness of the manifestation of the material elements, beginning with pradhana."

In this verse, it is figuratively said that the Purusa is contained within māyā, meaning that He is her presiding Lord, for in reality He is transcendental to her. This is confirmed by Śrī Kapiladeva in Srimad Bhagavatam:

Commentary 
B 
In order to further explain the usage of the word kaivalya in Śrī- mad Bhagavatam, Śrī Jiva Prabhu cites the sage Dattatreya from the Eleventh Canto (SB 11.9.18). The latter states that the Lord is called kaivalya because He is superior to all existence, material and spir- itual. He is free from all limiting designations and situated in the bliss of His own experience. This verse also implies that He has internal potency; otherwise, there is no need to say that He enjoys supreme bliss. Moreover, the word sandoha (totality) indicates that His internal energy is variegated. This is confirmed in su 6.8, "The transcendental Lord has multiple energies." 
"14 
Dattatreya goes on to describe, in the following verse, that the internal energy activates māyā: 
5di of bersam 
AO subduer of the enemies, at the time of creation, the Supreme Person destabilizes His material energy (maya), composed of the three gunas of material nature, through His unadulterated internal potency (kevalätmänubhāvena), and thus manifests the mahat-tattva (sutra)15

o called prakṛti 
Māyā, which is sometimes also called prakṛti or nature, has three divisions according to the gunas. In Anuccheda 18, māyā was divided into jīva-māyā and guṇa-māyā based on its being the efficient and the material cause, respectively. These divisions are explained in Mahā- samhita. Guṇa-māyā is nature's inert aspect; it produces insentient products. It is also called pradhana, in which the three gunas are in a balanced or equilibrated state. The efficient aspect, which influences the jiva, is called jīva-māyā. It is also divided into three, according to the three gunas. The presiding deities of these three energies are Bhu, Śrī and Durga. Their corresponding energetic counterparts are called Brahma, Visņu and Śiva, whose respective functions are the creation, maintenance, and dissolution of the cosmos. 
Mel In SB 12.8.45, the sage Märkandeya says: 
O my Lord, O supreme friend of the self, although You playfully accept the gunas of sattva, rajas and tamas for the sake of creat-a aving, maintaining and annihilating this world, it is Your pastimes in the mode of sattva that bring liberation to conditioned beings, and not the other two [rajas and tamas], which lead them simply into misfortune, bewilderment and fear!" 
wand brod 
The idea behind this verse is that although Visņu, like Brahmā and Śiva, is the energetic counterpart of one of the material gunas, He is transcendental to them. He should not be compared to the other two, for He is never touched by the gunas and thus has the power to liberate those who surrender unto Him. For this reason, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi writes that although the Purusa, or Paramātmā, 
16 In his Krama-sandarbha commentary, Śrī Jiva Prabhu glosses this compound as 
suddha-svarupa-prabhavena (the pure influence or power of His true Self), i.e., His internal potency. Śrīdhara Svāmi simply says kälena (by Time). Most translations follow the latter.

Deriving the meaning of māyā from the verbal root √mā, "by which one knows," atma-māyā can also mean energy in general, as in the following statement by Śrī Brahmä:

As the power of fog to create darkness is eclipsed by night, and the light of a glow worm, by daylight, so is the māyā of an ordi- nary person struck down when directed against a person of great power. (SB 10.13.45) 19

a superior energy. This is the gist of the verse, as depicted by the two illustrations of fog and the glow worm. The Purāņas relate stories of people who were killed or wounded in battle by weapons made of maya. This māyā should not be regarded as merely illusory or imagined, for no one gets wet from the water in a mirage. Caturveda-śikhā says: 
स्वरूपभूतया नित्यशक्त्या मायाख्यया युतः । 
अतो मायामयं विष्णुं प्रवदन्ति सनातनम् ॥ १०७ ।। 
The eternal Supreme Person, Śrī Visņu, is called Mayamaya (the possessor of maya), because He is endowed with His eternal energy, called māyā, as part of His essential nature.20

Thus, Caturveda-sikha and the Śruti confirm this meaning of māyā as energy. 
ततश्च “आत्ममाया तदिच्छा स्यात्" इत्यत्र ज्ञानक्रिये अपि लक्ष्येते । ज्ञानक्रियावृत्त्योरपी- च्छोपलक्षितत्वात् तेऽपि गृह्येते । 
Therefore, in the phrase, “His personal power is His will” (ātma- māyā tad iccha syat, from the Maha-samhita verse quoted above), His cognitive (jñāna) and working (kriyā) potencies are also indi- cated. Will (icchā) implies knowledge and action, so both of these are also accepted as inherent in the Lord. 
अत एव “माया वयुनं ज्ञानम्” इति निघण्टौ च पर्यायशब्दाः 
Therefore, Nighantu gives wisdom (vayuna) and knowledge (jñāna) as synonyms for māyā. The śabda mahodadhi lexicon says: Jo anotebag wod

In his commentary to SB 9.20.27, he writes, "Maya refers to the opulence of the gods." And in his comment on SB 3.15.26, he first explains the word yoga-māyā as the supernatural power manifest in the Kumāras by dint of aṣṭanga-yoga, and then in relation to the Lord, as the manifestation of His cit potency (cit-śakti-vilāsa). Thus, it has been established that atma-māyā has three divisions.

O unlimited Lord! Your will is called mahā-māyā, avidyā (igno- the rance), niyati (destiny), mohini (delusion), prakṛti (material 
nature) and väsana (subconscious impressions).23 
इति जीवमायाया अपीच्छात्वं दृश्यते तदिच्छाभासत्वेनैवेति ज्ञेयम् । जगत्कार्यहेतौ तस्यां साक्षात् तदिच्छात्वानभ्युपगमात् । गुणमाया त्रिगुणसाम्यं प्रधानमिति । 
When jiva-māyā is said to be the will of Bhagavan, as in the previ- ous verse, it should be known that it is only a shadow of His will. This is because Bhagavan's direct will does not intercede in the sphere of universal affairs. The word guṇa-maya means the three gunas in their balanced state (pradhana). 
Commentary pr 
arpo 
The word maya has many meanings and Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī here enumerates some of them on the basis of scriptural sources. Some of these meanings include energy, either internal or external, will, knowledge, action, intelligence, illusion, magic, pretence, mercy mercy and opulence. Generally, the word māyā is used in philosophy to denote Bhagavan's energies, both internal and external. Thus, Śrī Viṣṇu is called maya-maya (the possessor of maya, or energy). In the material world, māyā manifests as inert matter and the potency that enacts creation, maintenance and annihilation. In the spiritual world, maya is the variegated cit potency of Bhagavan. 
Bangadag geed and 
The Brahmavādīs claim that Brahman alone is real, and the mate- rial creation as well as the spiritual world of Vaikuntha are mithya, or māyā - brahma satyam jagan mithya jivo brahmaiva naparaḥ. They do not accept this material world as real in an absolute sense, only in an empirical sense. The Vaisnavas do not support this view. Rather, they understand prakṛti to be a real, and hence eternal, potency of the Lord, although finite and endlessly mutable. Therefore, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi gives numerous references from Srimad Bhagavatam to

226 
23 Threefold Māyā Is Real 
show that maya means the energy of Bhagavan. Sometimes the word may refer to the external energy and sometimes to the internal. This is supported by the numerous Sanskrit dictionaries. qolinderi 
Śrila Jiva Gosvāmi further explains that one should not mistake māyā to be mithya, or only empirically real. If it were so, the liv- ing entity could not be bound, and to say that the Lord activates māyā by His internal energy would make no sense. Nobody gets wet from the illusory water of a mirage, nor do mirages arise out of someone's will. Similarly, phenomenal existence has not arisen out of illusion. Otherwise, to say that Bhagavan's māyā causes the creation (cf. SB 11.3.36) would be senseless. The law of karma would have no meaning. Bhagavan's abode, form and pastimes would also be imaginary, since He is, after all, maya-maya (imbued with māyā). Ultimately, such a view can be put forth only if it assumed, a pri- ori, that the Absolute must be without potency. In the previous sec- tions, however, it was shown that Bhagavan has inherent potencies. By failing to accommodate this truth, Advaitavādīs are bound by the inbuilt limitations of their view to reduce māyā to empirical reality, and Bhagavan to a material designation. 
Is When it is said, therefore, that the light of a glow worm is insignificant in comparison to that of the sun (cf. SB 10.13.45), this illustrates how the internal energy is superior to the intermediary and external energies. The comparison is between different grades of energy, not between reality and illusion. This verse is taken from Kṛṣṇa's brahma-vimohana-lilä, when Śrī Kṛṣṇa took Brahma by sur- prise with a demonstration of His internal energy. There is no impli- cation in this verse or in the description of the lila that Brahma's stealing the calves and cowherd boys was false. Thus, the conclu- sion is that though the external energy is subdued by the internal, this does not mean that one is real and the other false, or that when one is realized in Brahman, the world ceases to exist. 
Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi has cited many references that offer various meanings for the word maya, yet none of them validate the idea of falseness, imaginariness or non-existence. It is very difficult to understand Bhagavan and His māyā, impossible for those lacking the inclusivity of devotion. Even great souls become bewildered,

Śrī Bhagavat Sandarbha 
muhyanti yat surayaḥ (SB 1.1.1), so it is not surprising that Advaitava- dis are unable to come to a proper conclusion. This is due to their inbuilt conceptual defect of assuming the Absolute to be without inherent energies, and thus not being able to comprehend Bhaga- vän as the Personal Nondual Absolute, encompassing even Brahman. Because of this conceptual defect, surrender to Bhagavan becomes an impossibility. When Brahma was finally able to comprehend something, he said: 
To people ignorant of Your actual transcendental position You appear as part of the material world, manifesting Yourself by Your Blue 
inconceivable energy. Thus, for the creation of the universe, You appear as me [Brahma], for its maintenance, You appear as Yourself [Visnu], and for its annihilation, You appear as Lord Trinetra [Śiva]. (SB 10.14.19)24 ji li vino dot jug od 
52 20 d 
ing Juoibiw 
100 
In this way, it has been established that Bhagavan's māyā has three divisions. The Upanisads compare māyā to a three-colored goat, referring to her three divisions, ajām ekām lohita-sukla-kṛṣṇām (SU 4.5). 
act 
Atma-māyā means the will of Bhagavan, which is His internal potency. It also indicates that He has knowledge and working potency, which is confirmed in the Upanisads, "Bhagavan natu- rally possesses knowledge, will and agency" (svabhäviki jñāna-bala- kriya ca, śu 6.8). The faculty of will would have no efficacy if He did not have working potency. And will naturally assumes knowledge about the object of will. When the word "will" is used in reference to the external energy, it indicates that the external energy works according to His will. It does not mean that it has independent will.

An alternative explanation of the main verse under discussion in this section ["You are the Original Person," etc., SB 1.7.23] can be given as follows: Although the existence of māyā is denied in Vai- kuntha, the existence there of the internal energy is confirmed in this verse. "You are always situated in the state of absolute unity (kaivalya), which is known as liberation and appears as Vaikuntha, Your own essential part. And what have You done to be thus situated? You showed disdain for māyā, even though it is already situated far away, through Your cit potency, which exists so majestically in Vaikuntha."

In that personal abode of the Lord, the material gunas of tamas 00 bed and rajas do not exist, nor does sattva, in which there is an admix- no ture of these.

Commentary 
Śri Bhagavat Sandarbha 
Śri Jiva Gosvāmi offers an alternative meaning of the main verse (SB 1.7.23) to emphasize the fact that dependent māyā has no entry into the spiritual world. It is the cit potency, or the internal energy, which reigns supreme in that abode. Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi concludes the section with a list of synonyms for Vaikuntha, all of which indicate that Vaikuntha is free from any contact with māyā.

It has been explained that Bhagavan is endowed with variegated energies, and that His energies are real, though at the same time inconceivable. For our basic understanding, these energies have been divided under three classifications - internal, external and intermediary - which are then further subdivided according to function. Although some of these energies continuously oppose one another, they exist harmoniously in Bhagavan, since He is their ulti- mate support. The relation between Bhagavan and His energies is like that of the sun and its rays - inconceivably simultaneously one and different. 
In the conditioned state, one cannot realize Bhagavan as the source behind creation. One may perceive the actions of some of His conscious and inert energies, without perceiving how these actions are impelled by the internal energy. The external energy is incited to act under the influence of the internal energy, as a piece of iron is pulled or rotated by a magnet. Although Bhagavan controls the external energy, it does not influence Him, just as a shadow does not affect its source. 
The external energy has two divisions —jīva-māyā and guṇa- māyā - and they each have three divisions according to the three gunas of material nature. Māyā is real; there is nothing illusory regarding her existence.

The first use of the word ajā refers to māyā, by whose influence the living being lies alongside her (ajā), meaning that he embraces ignorance (avidyā). Then, as the phrase 'delighting in her gunas' ("indulging the body and senses’ or ‘identifying himself with them ') indicates, the jiva sub- sequently takes a corresponding form (sarupată), i.e., he acquires material qualities. He loses all good fortune, meaning that his real qualities, such as bliss, are covered, and he suffers death, i.e., he falls into the cycle of birth and death. You, on the other hand, reject her, māyā.

“If Bhagavān should object, 'How can I reject her, who is situated within Me?' the Śrutis answer, 'like a serpent its skin.' The sense is this: The snake does not much value its skin, even though part of its body; similarly, You are indifferent to māyā, just as the owner of eternally blissful, transcendental kāma-dhenus (wish- fulfilling cows) is indifferent to an insignificant goat. Why is that? Because You are eternally associated with complete opu- lences (ätta-bhaga ). Mahasi ( in Your own glory) means in Your supreme Godhood, which is filled with 'eight paranormal poten- cies' like animā (atomization). Mahiyase (You are exalted) means 'You are worshiped,' or, 'You are situated.' How are you situated?

THE PHILOSOPHY OF BHAGAVATAM establishes one Absolute Non- dual Truth, without any peer. The natural questions that follow are, why is there empirical duality, and what is the nature of this Absolute Truth that is one without a second? This is a difficult sub- ject to understand and even more difficult to explain. Different wisdom schools have propagated different doctrines, attempting to accommodate empirical duality within the transcendent Abso- lute. Mainly, they can be divided in two groups - those who regard the Absolute as Oneness only, radically unqualified (non- theistic Vedanta), and those who regard the radically unqualified as but the indeterminate perception of the complete Nondual Abso- lute, encompassing all potency, personhood and distinction (the- istic Vedanta). The first group comprehends Absolute Reality as undifferentiated, all-pervading and devoid of energy, quality and personhood. This includes, primarily, Sankarācārya's Māyāvāda interpretation of Advaitavada, the followers of Bhartṛhari and the Pratyabhijña-vādīs of Kashmir. The second group (theistic Vedanta) includes the Vaisnavas, who mainly adhere to five philosophies:

All these Vaiṣṇava doctrines identify the Absolute as a person, possessing energies that are real. There are subtle nuances of dif- ference in view between the schools, as to how these energies are related to the Supreme Person. Śrī Jīva Prabhu explains these in Sarva-saṁvādīni. The main obstacle to the personal realization of the Absolute is Radical Nondualism (i.e., oneness alone, devoid of variety or potency), of which Mäyävāda (Sankarācārya's absolutist interpretation of Advaitavada) is the chief proponent. If this the- ory is exposed as inadequate to explain the Absolute Truth, then the other two schools of thought will be refuted along with them. So,

24 The Qualities of Bhagavan Are Intrinsic to His Nature 
throughout his work, Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī points out the inherent lim- itations and flaws in their theories, which necessarily deny the pos- sibility of understanding the Nondual Absolute, as a person, replete with transcendental potency. 
The followers of Sankarācārya hold that the material world is not real in the ultimate sense. It is like a dream: it appears real as long as one is asleep, but has no factual existence; when one wakes up, it is no more. The only reality is Brahman, which, by definition is an amorphous, non-variegated reality; it appears as many because of māyā. Advaitavādīs have different theories regarding māyā, and how she manifests this material world. Their explanations are cer- tainly not validated by Srimad Bhagavatam. This was shown in great detail in Tattva Sandarbha, Anucchedas 35-43. peab glois) 
According to Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi, the Bhāgavatam philosophy pro- pounds the doctrine of acintya-bheda-abheda. The Supreme Lord has energies, and these energies are simultaneously one with, and dif- ferent from, Him. This is inconceivable. Such inconceivability does not imply implausibility. After all, logically, the Absolute Truth has to have such inconceivable features, because it is the plane of exis- tence wherein all contradictions are reconciled. Here oneness and difference must co-exist. 
bas pa 
on and According to the norms of the widely accepted science of quan- tum mechanics, we have at hand an example of such inconceivable, but real, events in the sub-atomic world. In this domain, the same phenomenon - a sub-atomic particle is simultaneously a point and a wave. This is contrary to all logic and defies all explanation, other than to state the plain fact. Hence, the concept of simulta- neous oneness and difference, in regard to the Lord and His ener- gies, is not so far-fetched, though it may be inexplicable in terms of conventional experience.edit and esialgu odl 
Since the material world functions systematically, it must have only one underlying Supreme Person. A multiplicity of supreme per- sons would more likely produce chaos than systematic order. This Supreme Person is Bhagavan. He is both the material and efficient cause of the material creation. Die at mole 
237 
Śrī Bhagavat Sandarbha 
The last few anucchedas have explained how Bhagavan is the only cause and controller. All actions originate in Him and the material world is not independent of Him. He is the fountainhead of all ener- gies, which naturally and eternally exist in Him. Māyā is His eternal, natural potency. She is not a product of someone's dream or imagi- nation. She is His external potency, however, because He does not engage with her for transcendental lila. This in turn proves that the internal energy is most definitely part of His nature. His various qualities, all aspects of His internal energy, are therefore natural. This will be the subject of Anucchedas 24-28. have 
in 
Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī begins by citing from the prayers of the per- sonified Vedas, which glorify Bhagavan. This verse (SB 10.87.38) lucidly describes the Lord, His relation with the internal and external energies and the conditioning of the living beings. 
The verse first explains that the living being is conditioned because of its association with the material energy. Though con- scious and blissful by nature, the jiva assumes a phenomenal and constricted nature, owing to absorption in the material body and senses. Thus, although conscious and eternal, he is deluded and experiences death, owing to material association. It will be explained in Paramatma Sandarbha that this association with māyā has no beginning and, hence, is not by any faulty choice of the jiva, nor by any capricious choice of the Lord Himself. This implies that the jiva should abandon oppressive association and take up association with the True, as Canakya Pandita advises - tyaja durjana-samṁsargam bhaja sädhu-samagamam. In this verse, the word anusayita is glossed by Śrīdhara Svāmī as meaning "to embrace" (alinget), or in other words, to be bound by the material designations (upādhis) of māyā. 93 01 
The question arises, why is Bhagavan not conditioned by māyā? The verse explains that He "abandons" (jahāti) her. This means He does not associate with or engage with her for enjoyment. She can- not, therefore, have any influence on Him. 
A further doubt is raised. How can the Lord abandon māyā, who is His potency? The verse clarifies that mayä is like the skin of a snake. When a snake's skin is old, it slackens and clings loosely to 
238 
24 The Qualities of Bhagavan Are Intrinsic to His Nature 
the snake's body. At that point, the skin is part of the snake's body and yet not part of its body. The old skin originated from the snake and is supported by it, yet the snake feels no loss when the skin is finally shed. Similarly, maya is neither independent of the Lord nor part of His internal nature. 
Just as clouds cannot cover the sun, māyā cannot cover Bhaga- van. Clouds can cover only the vision of the living being. The infe- rior nature of māyā does not reflect onto the personhood of the Lord, owing to His inconceivable power. The meaning of the phrase, “He abandons her," is that He does not engage with her and thus consid- ers her insignificant.day 
du 
M 
In this Bhāgavatam verse, māyā is called aja (unborn), because she is beginingless or unborn. There is a pun, however, as ajā also means "goat." Śrī Kṛṣṇa is a cowherd boy who tends millions of kama- dhenus, wish-fulfilling cows. So what need is there for Him to keep an insignificant goat? No need whatsoever! The kama-dhenus are His personal opulence and are unlimited. 
The verse mentions Krsna's eight paranormal powers and immea- surable opulences (astagunite'parimeya-bhagah), or eight types of opulences that have no limit. In the Eleventh Canto of Śrimad Bhāgavatam, the Lord describes eighteen types of psycho-spiritual perfection, eight of which belong predominately to Him: 
The Supreme Lord said: The masters of the yoga system have declared that there are 18 types of paranormal power, of which eight are primary, having their shelter in Me. The ten others are secondary, appearing from the material gunas? 
nisom daga att Among the eight primary paranormal powers, the three by which one transforms one's own body are animă (atomization), becom- ofing smaller than the smallest; mahima (magnification), becoming For greater than the greatest; and laghima (levitation), becoming lighter 
than the lightest. Through prapti (attainment), one has the power of acquiring whatever one desires, and through prākāmya-siddhi (wish-fulfillment), one can experience any enjoyable object, either

One who has kāmāvasäyitä-siddhi (dwelling in virtual-worlds of desire), can obtain anything from anywhere to the highest possible limit. My dear gentle Uddhava, these eight paranormal powers naturally exist in Me and are unexcelled. (SB 11.15.3-8)10

Bhagavan is full of bliss, knowledge, energy and opulence, so why is He not perceived by everyone, at all times and in all places? Because the jivas have embraced the inferior energy, māyā. Although the Lord is present everywhere, He cannot be perceived through the material senses:

I am not manifest to everyone, for I am covered by My yoga-māyā. nor This foolish world does not know Me, who am unborn and infallible. 
(GĪTĀ 7.25)12 
Just as the sun is present always in the sky, but is not visible to everyone at all times, so the Lord is visible only when He mani- fests His pastimes in the cosmos at a specific time. At other times, He remains covered by a veil of māyā, māyā-javanikācchannam (SB 1.8.19). Yet even when He manifests His pastimes, not everyone

can recognize Him as the Lord on account of this covering of māyā, just as the sun cannot be seen when clouds cover our vision. The veil of māyā is a manifestation of the three gunas. An inferior object is generally used to conceal a superior one. As cloth is used to hide a gem, or an iron strongbox to secure money, similarly, Bhagavan hides Himself with the veil of māyā. This shows not only that He is superior to māyā, but that His abode and attributes are also of the same nature as Himself. 
In the fifth chapter of the sixth division of Visnu Purana, Parāśāra Muni gives a detailed definition of the word bhagavan. Some of these verses have already been discussed in Anuccheda 3. There Parāśara says that the Lord has natural attributes and potencies that consti- tute His essential nature. When the word bhagavan is used to refer to someone other than the Lord, it does not carry this original meaning, but is simply used as a sign of respect. 
Svetasvatara Upanisad explains that māyā consists of the three gunas and that she overpowers the living being who is identified with, and wants to enjoy, her (śu 4.5). The Lord, who is aja (unborn), abandons this māyā, also called unborn (ajā). This verse indicates furthermore that Bhagavan, the material energy and the living being are all eternal. That the material energy creates progeny means she supplies material bodies to the living beings, and these bodies are endowed with the same material nature (sarupa). The word prajah (progeny) is in the plural number and indicates the many conditioned beings. The Lord, on the other hand, is just one, aja, the primary unborn, who takes no interest in māyā. Māyā is also one, ajām ekām. 
The alternative explanation of the word māyā, found in the main verse of this anuccheda (SB 10.87.38), is that she is like the shed skin of a snake. Snakes shed their skin yearly. The shed skin has no utility for the snake. It belongs to the snake, but it is not part of his body. It is his "external energy." The shed skin is not false or illusory, but is not alive like the snake's body. This example explains the difference between Bhagavan's internal and external energies. The qualities of the internal energy are part of the Lord's own svarupa, just as the qualities of the snake's body are part of its body's svarupa.

In the next anuccheda, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī gives further scriptural references substantiating that Bhagavan's qualities are intrinsic to His nature. Radical Nondualists do not accept the absolute nature of His qualities.

ŚRILA JIVA GOSVĀMĪ OFFERS FURTHER REFERENCES TO SHOW that Bhagavan is full of inherent transcendental qualities that do not undergo any mutation, since material qualities are absent in Him. Most of these verses use variations on the word guna, which means attribute or quality. When applied to material nature, it means con- stituent and refers to the three qualities of sattva, rajas and tamas.

25 Bhagavan's Attributes Constitute His Essential Nature 
The words nirguna (without attributes) and saguna (with attributes), are used frequently by Advaitavadīs, who consider nirguna-brahma to be the true Absolute, and the saguna-brahma to be a lesser mani- festation of God within the illusory world of phenomena. The exam- ples quoted by Śri Jiva are meant to show that Bhagavan does possess qualities or attributes without being under the influence or control of māyā's three qualities, or gunas.atque 
Are In chapter 13 of the Eleventh Canto of Srimad Bhagavatam, Kṛṣṇa explains to Uddhava about the gunas of nature and their influences. The Lord recounts that the four Kumāras once asked their father the following question: 
SIL 
lle O Lord, people's minds are naturally attracted to material sense zi objects, and similarly the sense objects, in the form of desire, enter ar 
within the mind. Therefore, how can a person who desires libera- tion, who desires to cross beyond the mire of sensual indulgence, break-free from this mutual bond between the sense objects and the mind? (SB 11.13.7)5 
Śrī Brahma was unable to answer the question because his intelli- gence was absorbed in the work of creation. He prayed to Śrī Kṛṣṇa, who assumed the form of a swan and replied to the queries of the Kumāras. The main verse of this anuccheda is one of the verses spo- ken by Lord Hamsa. 
opian 2 best ad oals no brow duo In it, the Lord says that all attributes (gunas) worship Him. Since He is the Supreme Person, why should the attributes worship any- one else? If they do, they should not rightly be called "attributes." The Lord says that He is nirguna - one who is free from material qualities, as described in Padma Purāṇa:

Śrī Bhagavat Sandarbha 
The word guna refers to the constituents of nature, and thus nir- guna means one who is free of them. Thus, the word can be trans- lated as "transcendental." Other etymologies can be elaborated as follows: Nirguna means the fountainhead of all qualities, or, the One whose attributes are beyond the gunas of material nature. Therefore, Sūta Gosvāmi calls Kṛṣṇa "the Self of all qualities, who is beyond all qualities" (nirgunasya gunātmanaḥ, SB 1.10.19). 
12pm to Nirapekṣakam (indifferent) also means absolute or independent. Because Bhagavan is complete in Himself, He does not depend on the material creation for anything. He is His own support, svāśraya. For those who say that the Lord is dependent on His parents, Śrīmati Yasoda and Nanda Mahārāja, or upon those He stole butter from, this verse replies, suhṛdam priyam ātmānam, "He is the well-wisher of all, the most beloved Self." The implication is that the Lord enacts His divine play for the benefit of His intimate and dear devotees, who are like His very Self (ātmānam). Thus, He is not dependent on anyone else. He has natural attributes, as stated in Svetasvatara Upanisad: 
The Lord has variegated transcendental potencies naturally existing in Him, such as knowledge, will and action. (śu 6.8)" 
The Lord says that He has attributes like samya, which means that He is equal to all, and asanga, or absence of attachment. This word can also be read as asanga, which would then mean that He is affectionately bound to His devotees, even though He is without attachment for material nature and her products. His attributes are called agunaḥ (free of the gunas), because they do not undergo any transformation.lowance at Hvad my biod siff 
The six qualities mentioned in Jitante-stotra are the six opulences of knowledge, fame, wealth, absence of attachment, controlling power and inconceivable power.

library, but it is no longer available. The quote is relevant because it uses the word guni to describe Bhagavan as one possessing attributes. It then confirms that these attributes arise out of His svarupa, and so they are not like the material qualities that are products of māyā. 
The significance of the statement made by Devi, "I am unable to describe Your form," is that Bhagavan is transcendental. Devi is in charge of the material gunas, and thus, she cannot approach the Lord who is beyond them. 9 STA 29

Commentary 
TO FURTHER ESTABLISH that Bhagavan's attributes are eternal, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi quotes a verse that Mother Earth, in the form of a cow, spoke to Dharma personified. When Parīkṣit Mahārāja was on a world tour, he saw Dharma personified in the form of a bull stand- ing on one leg and speaking to Mother Earth. The cow had lost her beauty and was dejected. The bull inquired after her welfare, think- ing that since Śrī Kṛṣṇa had left for His abode, powerful time had snatched away all her good fortune.dly 'brod silt Jars antelo 
In response, the cow enumerated 39 characteristics of the Lord and then spoke the principal verse of this anuccheda. She was lamenting because Kṛṣṇa, who possesses all wonderful qualities, had left, and thus the whole world had fallen under the grip of Kali. The earth's beauty is measured not by rivers, mountains, mines and forests, but by how many saintly people reside on her surface. In the same way, a person is beautiful not because of having a perfectly sculptured body, but because of his or her beautiful attributes. In this regard, Bhartṛhari says (Niti-sataka 72): assista 
3 
The real ornament of the ear is not an earring, but one's learning. The hands appear beautiful not by donning golden bangles, but by 
da giving in charity. The bodies of benevolent people are decorated not 
with sandalwood paste, but by the welfare they bestow on others.*

Mother Earth therefore said that she had lost her beauty because Śrī Kṛṣṇa, who is the abode of all wonderful qualities, had aban- doned her. Nevertheless, she stated that His qualities are eternal and do not diminish or change in time. In his Krama-sandarbha, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī lists 85 of Sri Krsna's qualities, and Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmi lists 64 in his Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu. These are only token mentions of His qualities, for in actuality there is no end to them. Śrī Brahmā says: gavan 
Even for those highly qualified people who, given the time, might be able to count all the atoms of the earth, the snowflakes in the sky, or the rays of the sun, who amongst them could possibly count Your qualities, You who are the embodiment of all qualities and have www descended to this earth for the welfare of all?

The words na viyanti sma mean that Bhagavan's qualities do not decay. In the material world, people have good qualities but they are not permanent. Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī cites a verse from Visnu Purāṇa, spoken by Śrī Brahma to King Raivata regarding Śrī Balarama, which explains that the Lord's vibhutis are not influenced even by the smallest unit of time. 
By the mercy of Bhagavan, His devotees are also imbued with a portion of these attributes. Prahlada Mahārāja confirms this in the Fifth Canto:

When one has devotion for the Supreme Lord without desire for any personal goal, all the gods come and invest him with their qualities. As for the non-devotees, where are their virtues? Led by their desires, they are always superficially running about in Queimpermanent existence (SB 5.18.12).

Even if such a non-devotee is adept in the practice of astanga- yoga or makes an honest endeavor at maintaining his family and rel- atives, he will be driven by his own mental speculations and must

thus engage in the service of the Lord's external energy. How can there be any real qualities in such a person? 
According to logic, the relation between a substance and its essential qualities is invariable. For example, the relation between sugar and sweetness is permanent (i.e., it exists as long as the sugar exists), for it can never change - the attributes of a substance define the substance itself. Similarly, the qualities of the Lord are eternal in relationship to Him (samavaya-sambandha), and because He is eternal, His qualities are also eternal. The principle of logic states, nityam gate nityam, the attributes of an eternal substance are eter- nal. Therefore, time can have no influence over the attributes of Bhagavan.

THEREFORE, Varuna prayed to the Lord: 
नमस्तुभ्यं भगवते ब्रह्मणे परमात्मने ।

My obeisances unto You, the Supreme Nondual Personal Whole (Bhagavan), the Absolute Truth (Brahman), and the Supreme Imminent Self (Paramātmā). Māyā, which orchestrates the creation of this world, has never been heard of within You. HOT (SB 10.28.6)1

No one has ever heard of maya being present in Śrī Kṛṣṇa, whose essential nature manifests in the three aspects of Brahman, Paramātmā and Bhagavan. This means that the perception of Him in any of these three manifestations is not possible through māyā. The reason is that māyā has the natural ability to orches- trate (vikalpana) only the material affairs through the acts of creating, maintaining and annihilating the cosmos (loka-srsti).

Therefore, while inquiring about the structure of the universe, King Parikṣit says, with the intent of showing that the Lord is transcendental:

The mind that can be fixed on the gross material form of the Lord can also meditate upon the most subtle, self-effulgent, transcen- dent Lord, Parabrahman, called Śrī Vasudeva. (SB 5.16.3)2 
Commentary

ŚRILA JIVA GOSVĀMĪ HAS ALREADY ESTABLISHED that the one Abso- lute Truth manifests in three features - Brahman, Paramātmā and Bhagavan. He has also shown in previous anucchedas that the Lord and His attributes are free from the gunas of nature. This raises a doubt: Are the other two features, Brahman and Paramātmā, also free from the influence of māyā? In answer, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi quotes a verse that Varuna, the god of water, spoke to Kṛṣṇa when He went to rescue His father, who had been arrested for taking bath in the Yamuna at a forbidden hour. 
In this verse, Varuna explicitly states that Brahman, Param- ātmā and Bhagavan are all free from the influence of māyā. The Lord's qualities are not products of maya. She is neither heard nor seen there - na yatra śruyate. Māyā has influence only in the mate- rial world. Therefore, it is not possible to realize the Lord and His attributes through the help of māyā. 
The second verse is by Parīkṣit Mahārāja. He wanted to under- stand the structure of the cosmos. Sometimes neophytes on the path of transcendence have difficulty fixing their mind on the transcen- dental form of the Lord. They are advised to meditate on the viraț

form of the Lord and visualize the whole cosmos as His body. This virat form is material and not the Lord's real form. It is a facility to aid their meditation. Later, when the candidate is able to focus his mind, he is taught to fix it on the self-effulgent Lord, who has a per- sonal form that is transcendental to the gunas of nature. 
From Parikṣit's question, it is clear that Bhagavan's personal form is not imbued with the gunas of nature. The ultimate purpose of meditating on the cosmic form is to progress to the level of Bha- gavan realization. This is the purpose of the description given in the Fifth Canto of Bhagavatam about the structure of the cosmos. Parīkṣit Mahārāja calls the Lord's form aguna, or free from the mate- rial gunas. Because virat is also called the form of the Lord, one should not confuse it to be part of His essential nature. This is the significance of referring to Parikṣit's question. 
In the next anuccheda, Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmi will provide further evidence of Bhagavan's being free from the influence of māyā.

Māyā, knowing herself to be defective, owing to the presence of the material gunas, such as ignorance, and realizing Bhagavan to be blissful, eternal, all-knowing, and thus free from defects, feels shy to stand before Him and flees from Him. But less intelligent persons like me, bewildered by her, boast of "I" and "Mine."

Commentary and 
Śri Bhagavat Sandarbha 
MAYA BEWILDERS THE CONDITIONED BEINGS in a number of ways. One is to conceal the Lord so that people think Him to be material. Māyā cannot put the Lord into ignorance the way a living being is covered, but she can hide Bhagavan so that the ignorant cannot see Him as He is. In Bhagavad Gita, Kṛṣṇna says: 
nevegend 910190 769907A of via 21991.sysM Being unacquainted with My ontological identity as the Supreme Lord of all existence, the bewildered misconceive Me as having accepted a [perishable and limited] human body. (GITA 9.11)2 
Another way māyā bewilders the conditioned beings is to make them consider an ordinary human being to be the Supreme Person. In the last anuccheda it was shown that the Lord is not an ordinary person, nor is He material. This anuccheda explains that an ordinary person can never be the Supreme Lord, and whoever thinks in this way is certainly bewildered by māyā (vimohita). Such bewilderment is prevalent in modern times, especially in India, the land of avataras. There is always a so-called avatara appearing in India, showering His blessings on the naive with a poor fund of scriptural knowledge. 
Nārada Muni once approached his father, Śrī Brahma, the cre- ator and first person in the cosmos. Brahma is the father and teacher of great sages like the Kumāras and the Prajapatis. Nārada thought Śrī Brahma was the Supreme Lord, yet he could not comprehend why he had undergone severe austerities to accomplish the work of creation. This created a doubt in his mind. The Supreme Lord has natural powers and opulences. He cannot depend on anyone for any- thing. By way of contrast, modern so-called avatāras depend on busi- ness tycoons or trickery to maintain their godhood. Therefore, after eulogizing Śrī Brahma for his prowess as the creator, Narada Muni posed this relevant question, "Is there anybody above you?" 
Brahma is a pure devotee of Śrī Kṛṣṇa and thus completely free from the cheating propensity. He was neither flattered by Narada's eulogy nor did he misguide his son in replying to his question.

28 Maya Feels Shy to Appear before Bhagavan 
Although he is exceedingly powerful, knowledgeable and intelli- gent, and in fact a guṇāvatāra, he did not pose as one. He imme- diately prayed to the Lord who had empowered him to create the universe. Śrī Brahma said that maya is very difficult to surpass (dur- jaya), and therefore, people fall prey to her. Being bewildered by her, they consider a living being, or jiva, as God. Brahma, the knower of the Vedas, clearly denounces such thought. Accordingly, he prays to Bhagavan in Brahma-samhita 5.53: 
I adore the primeval Śrī Govinda, by whose conferred power are maintained all manifested potencies found to exist, whether of virtues, vices, the Vedas, penances and all the jivas from Brahmā to the meanest insect. 
This maya cannot face Bhagavan, however, just as darkness can- not face the Sun. Māyā is not magic, illusion, or something false - it is a potency of Bhagavan. Māyā has factual existence. Sometimes His energies are likened to His wives. In that sense, Māyā is also the Lord's wife, but her service is to entice the living beings. The Lord is aware of this impure task, and thus she feels shy to come into His presence. Moreover, she knows the Lord to be transcendental, and herself as consisting of the gunas. Thus, she is unable to face Him. This has also been discussed in Tattva Sandarbha, Anucchedas 31-32. 
The purpose of citing these two verses here is to show that Bhaga- vän and His qualities are not made of material gunas. Indeed, Māyā cannot even come close to Him. In comparison to the Lord's opu- lence, the totality of her opulence is no more than the flicker of a glow worm in front of the sun. 
3 
In the last five anucchedas Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī has established that: 
1. Bhagavan has unlimited inherent attributes. 
2. All His potencies are eternal. 
3. Mäyä, the external potency, does not influence Him.

Bhagavan's Body Is Part of His Essential Nature

IN THIS WAY, after explaining that the six opulences, beginning with controlling power, are part of Bhagavan's essential nature, a new section is here begun in order to establish that His body fully belongs to His essential nature. The characteristic of the Lord's body of being eternally part of His essential nature has been nat- urally established in earlier sections because of His being the pre- siding deity of Vaikuntha, which is eternal. Now it will be shown that even when the Lord appears in the material world, His body is still part of His essential nature. This is stated in the following three verses spoken by Devaki to the newly-born Kṛṣṇa: 
1 
नष्टे लोके द्विपरार्द्धावसाने महाभूतेष्वादिभूतं गतेषु । 
व्यक्तेऽव्यक्तं कालवेगेन याते भवानेकः शिष्यते शेषसञ्ज्ञः || १२६ ॥ 
After the lifetime of Śrī Brahma, at the time of cosmic dissolution, when all the five gross elements enter into their original undiffer-V entiated state, and the manifest enters into the unmanifest by the force of time, then You, who are known as Seṣa, alone remain.2 
See Anuccheda 10.

Śri Bhagavat Sandarbha 
अतः शेषसञ्ज्ञः । तत्र युक्तिः (भा० १० । ३ । २६) - 
Therefore, He is called Seșa. The reasoning behind this is given in the following verse: 
योऽयं कालस्तस्य तेऽव्यक्तबन्धो चेष्टामाहुश्चेष्टते येन विश्वम् । निमेषादिर्वत्सरान्तो महीयांस्तं त्वेशानं क्षेमधाम प्रपद्ये ॥ १२७ ॥ 
O friend of the unmanifest (prakṛti)! This phenomenon of time, 
This phenomenon of time. by which the cosmos becomes active, is Your own action. It is divided into units, from a nanosecond (nimeşa) to years, up to periods as long as the lifetime of Brahma, but You are its mas- ter and the abode of all auspiciousness. I take shelter of You. (SB 10.3.26)3 
हे अव्यक्तबन्धो सान्निध्यमात्रेण प्रकृतिप्रवर्तक । चेष्टा निमेषोन्मेषरूपाम् । 
O Friend of the unmanifest (avyakta-bandho), You who set the unmanifest material nature (prakṛti) into motion by Your mere proximity. Your action (ceṣṭā) takes the form of Your eyes opening and closing.

26029 Bhagavan's Body Is Part of His Essential Nature 
Time is the efficient cause behind every creation and annihila- tion. But because time is manifest from the bodily movement of the Lord, creation and annihilation cannot apply to the Lord's body. This is the sense [of Devaki's words]. Another reason for this [absence of creation and destruction in the Lord's body] is that He is the "abode of all auspiciousness" (kṣema-dhama). Tvä means "unto You." blevod

In this verse, Śrīmati Devaki dispels her fear of Kamsa through the a fortiori arguments that since this Lord [who is the master of time and is, therefore, in control of the creation, maintenance and dissolution of the cosmos] has appeared in accordance with His own desire, [it goes without saying that He should have no fear of Kamsa]. She makes this clear in the next verse: 
मर्त्यो मृत्युव्यालभीतः पलायन् लोकान् सर्वान् निर्भयं नाध्यगच्छत् । त्वत्पादाब्जं प्राप्य यदृच्छयाद्य स्वस्थः शेते मृत्युरस्मादपैति ॥ १२८ ॥ 
All human beings are mortal and are thus constantly afraid of being swallowed up by the great serpent of death. They may flee95 to any of the worlds, but nowhere can they find freedom from U fear. O Original One, only when through some great fortune they attain Your lotus feet, can they finally rest in peace and happiness, for Death himself flees in fear of You. (SB 10.3.27)6 
लोकान् प्राप्य निर्भयं भयाभावम् । त्वत्पादाब्जं तु प्राप्येत्युभयत्राप्यन्वयः ।

The term kaimutya-nyaya is best rendered in Western logic by the term argumentum a fortiori, or "an argument from a yet stronger reason." It simply means that if x is more than y, then "it should go without saying" that 1000x is also more than y. Here, if Krsna is the source of time and is feared even by Death, then it goes without saying that He or anyone under His protection should have no fear of a mere mortal like Kamsa. For another example, see Section 10.2. martyo mṛtyu-vyala-bhitaḥ palayan lokan sarvän nirbhayaṁ nadhyagacchat tvat-pādābjam präpya yadṛcchayadya svasthaḥ śete mṛtyur asmãd apaiti

Here, by saying "Your lotus feet," Devaki clearly establishes that the Lord's form is such that death fears it. Therefore, the Lord has been named amṛta-vapu, or one who has an immortal body, in Sahasra-nama-stotra. While commenting on this name, Sankarācārya says, "Mṛta means death. Since Bhagavan's body is free from death, He is called amṛta-vapu."?

By addressing the Lord as adya (O Original One), it is also shown that His body is birthless, because only those things that take birth have a beginning.

Commentary 
IN THIS AND THE NEXT SECTION, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī establishes that Bhagavan's body is not material, nor is it acquired at a certain time for a specific purpose. His appearance in the material world is thus called avataraṇa, which means "descent," the implication being that

29 Bhagavan's Body Is Part of His Essential Nature 
He existed before descending. In the strict sense, "incarnation," which means to become embodied, is not the proper translation for avatara because the Lord has an eternal body that is not made of flesh (lat. caro). Neither does His body undergo any form of trans- formation, as does material nature, which is also said to be eter- nal. Although His body gives the impression of growth when He appears as a human being, He does not become old and decrepit as an ordinary mortal.

In Anuccheda 10, it was shown that Vaikuntha is eternal, tran- scendental to the gunas of nature and free from the influence of time, pravartate yatra rajas tamas tayoḥ sattvam ca miśram na ca kala- vikramaḥ (SB 2.9.10). The Lord presides over Vaikuntha; therefore, His body must be free from the material gunas and the influence of time. It was shown that everything in Vaikuntha is constituted of viśuddha-sattva (unadulterated being, free of the gunas). This natu- rally includes the Lord's body.

lil Some may accept that His body is transcendental when He is sit- uated in the transcendental abode, but that, when He comes into the material world, He must accept a material body. After all, every- thing in the material world is material, just as everything in the spir- itual world is made of spirit. Thus, it is not surprising to hear that Śrī Kṛṣṇa took birth from Mother Devaki and grew up like any other baby. 
duild of poles lamiad of leups 5 10 To dispel such doubts, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi quotes three verses that Mother Devaki spoke to Śrī Kṛṣṇa when He appeared to her in His four-handed form in Kamsa's prison. These three verses explain that when Śrī Kṛṣṇa appears on the earth, He does so in a transcendental body. Mother Devaki says that the Lord's body is beyond the influ- ence of time, which has sway only over matter. This means that His body is not material but spiritual. It further implies that He is non- different from His body, as both are spiritual. The phrase "His body" is used figuratively; it does not mean that He is different from it, as is the case with mortal beings whose bodies are material. Śrīla Vyasa's trance, which was analyzed in Tattva Sandarbha, also reveals that māyā is apart from Bhagavan. This means that His body is 
10 māyāṁ ca tad-apāśrayām→

Malin Śrī Bhagavat Sandarbha 
completely transcendental. Each cycle of material creation endures for the life-span of Brahma, which is called para or dvi-parardha. Vişņu Purana states:bb

The life span of Śrī Brahma is called para and is equal to one hundred years according to his own time scale. One half of this duration is called parardha. (VP 1.3.5)11

At the end of Brahma's life, the cosmos is dissolved in the way that a telescope is infolded progressively into itself. All the material elements, beginning with earth, dissolve into their immediate cause, ultimately leaving only unmanifest Nature. The Supreme Lord, how- ever, remains even after the total annihilation of the cosmos, and thus, He is called śeşa (lit., "remainder"). This means that His body is not material and time has no influence on Him.wore wond 
Time exercises its influence on the gunas of nature, but in fact is not independent. This is implied in the second of the three verses by Mother Devaki (SB 10.3.26). She said that time is the Lord's bodily movement. This indicates that time is under His control, because movement of the bodily limbs is under a person's control and not vice

The Lord's bodily movement refers to His glance. Nimeșa literally means the twinkling of an eye, but the word is also used as a unit of time equal to the time it takes to blink - akṣi-pakṣam aparikṣepo nimeşa parikirtitah. When the Lord is inspired to create, He glances at material nature (sa aikṣata, Aitareya Upanisad 1.1). His glance marks the inception of time, which immediately begins to act on nature. When He closes His eyes, it indicates that it is time for the complete annihilation. In the period after annihilation and before the next creation, time is inactive. Creation and destruction happen under the influence of time. Bhagavan's body is eternal because it is neither created nor destroyed. 
Kāla means time, but it also means death, because it destroys everything. Therefore, everyone in the material world instinctively

Time I am, the destroyer of all beings. (GĪTĀ 11.32)12

Death prevails from the highest planet to the lowest, and no one can avoid it. This lesson was taught in the story of Durvāsā Muni and Ambarīṣa Mahārāja, which is described in the Ninth Canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. Due to Durvasa Muni's offense at the lotus feet of a great devotee, Ambarīṣa Mahārāja, the Lord's Sudarśana Cakra chased Durvāsā all over the cosmos. Fleeing in fear, Durvāsā Muni sought shelter everywhere, but nowhere could he find relief. He found peace only after apologizing to Ambarīṣa Mahārāja and was thus able to take shelter of the Lord. 
In Mahabharata, Bhismadeva instructed Yudhisthira Mahārāja about the influence of time: 
eTime brings an end to all living beings, who are all within its jurisdic-2 zation. No one knows that person by whom time itself is terminated. 
(MB, Santi-parva 239.25)13

Death, which causes fear in everyone, is afraid of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, "Fear personified fears Him" (yad bibheti svayam bhayam, SB 1.10.14). ni Kṣema-dhāma (in SB 10.3.26) means "the abode of auspicious- ness." Kṣema also signifies protection. Because time has no influ- ence on Bhagavan, His opulence is always free from any danger. By using this word, Devaki Devi announced her freedom from fear of her brother Kamsa, who was under the influence of time. One who takes shelter of Śrī Kṛṣṇa is free from the influence of time, so nat- urally Devaki had no fear of Kamsa. This is called kaimutya-nyaya, or arguing a fortiori. If a person has no fear of a lion, then what fear will he have of a gnat? Another example of this rhetorical device is found in the Sixth Canto:

Ajamila cried out the name of Bhagavan while dying, with these for intention of calling his son. If he attained the Lord's abode by such von Vis utterance, then what of a person who chants with faith?14 
8.11 Azfo).agnind lie to segonash sir,ms I smil The phrase "Your lotus feet" (tvat-pädäbja) clearly indicates Bha- gavan's body and not His unqualified feature. Devaki's prayers clearly show that His body is transcendental, eternal, and free from the influence of time. Time, or death, is sometimes symbolized by a snake, and Krsna in His Nārāyaṇa form rests on a snake bed. This signifies that He is beyond the influence of both features of kala, decay and death. 
While commenting on the epithet amṛta-vapu, one of the thou- sand names of Śrī Viṣņu, Sankaracarya also accepts that the Lord's body is deathless (cf. Sahasranama-bhāṣya 100).re sa o alde curs 
An objection may be raised here: Anyone who takes birth must die. This natural law is asserted by Kṛṣṇa in Bhagavad Gita, "One who has taken birth is sure to die, and after death, birth is certain."15 Since Kṛṣṇa took birth, how can He be spared death? The answer is found in SB 10.3.8, where it is explained that the Lord appeared as the full moon appears in the East. Though the moon is always in the sky, it is visible only to certain people at certain times. Simi- larly, Śrī Kṛṣṇa is eternally present, but He is visible only during the Dvaparayuga of the twenty-eighth cycle of the seventh Manu. The Lord is unborn, yet He performs the pastime of birth. Elsewhere in Bhagavad Gită He says:98 
197HTED VITE 
Although I am never born and My body never deteriorates, and even Brythough I am the Lord of all living beings, I am situated in My own Shahnature when I appear by My internal potency. (GĪTĀ 4.6)16 
Kṛṣṇa's birth is not like that of an ordinary living being, who is ruled by the laws of karma. He is the Isvara of all living beings.

29 Bhagavan's Body Is Part of His Essential Nature 
A living entity's birth is under the control of karma and time, but Bhagavan is their master. 
One may counter that the living being does not take birth either. His accepting a body is designated as birth, but there is in fact no birth for the self. What then is so special about Kṛṣṇa's birth? To this the Lord says that He is avayayātmā: His body is transcendental and never deteriorates; thus, He never changes bodies. Moreover, He takes birth by His own energy, atma-māyā, and not through the agency of the material energy or under the influence of karma. Even when He appears to take birth, He remains in His original svarupa and does not accept a material body. Hence, there is considerable difference between Bhagavan's birth and that of the living being. As a result, Kṛṣṇa calls His birth divya, or transcendental (janma karma ca me divyam, GĪTĀ 4.9). His birth, which resembles that of ordinary human beings, is His līlā, or pastime, enacted for the pleasure of devotees like Devaki.

SO ALSO, IN THE FIFTH CANTO, Śrī Suka says: "His form is perma- nent (dhruva) and uncreated (akṛta)." The "His" of this verse is Lord Sankarṣaṇa. The word dhruva indicates that His form has no end, and akṛta, that it is without beginning. Therefore, in the description of the worship of the presiding deities of the various divisions of Jambudvipa, Lord Siva also said, in reference to this form:

Although He glances over the material world for the purpose of creating, maintaining and destroying it, His glancing (i.e., His act of perception) is not, even to the slightest extent, subject to the fluctuations of mind (citta-vṛttis) that operate under the control of the material gunas.

It should be noted, however, that Sukadeva Gosvāmī elsewhere refers to this form of Sri Sankarṣaṇa in these words, "This expansion of the Lord is the predominating deity of tamo-guna" (SB 5.25.1), and then in SB 5.17.16 he uses the expression, "the embodiment of tamas" (tāmasim mürtim). This is in reference to Lord Śiva, Bhagavan's expansion for the welfare of those in tamo- guna. [This is to be concluded because] in the verse immediately following the one referred to at the beginning of this section, Śrī Śuka continues citing Närada, who says: dihw gnilesh

they refer to descriptions from kalpas dominated by darkness and ignorance, and in these kalpas the Lord conceals His glories. Such misleading statements do not truly describe the reality of Bhagavan; their purpose, rather, is to propagate dry renunci- ation, to glorify Śri Śiva, and so forth. Since their real import doesn't concern itself directly with Bhagavan, their primary sense does not hold true when commenting on that Supreme Reality. Śrī Śiva instructs his son, Skanda, in Skanda Purāṇa that Vaiṣṇavas should not accept scriptural statements that estab- lish Śiva and others as Supreme: "In these scriptures describing the glory of Lord Siva, only those statements that support the scriptures dealing with Visņu should be accepted."

This does not mean, however, that such Purānas are inauthen- tic. As will be shown in Paramātma Sandarbha, according to statements from Matsya Purana, such Purānas have descriptions from the rājasa and tamasa-kalpas. The Purāṇas that establish Śrī Visņu as Supreme relate stories from the sättvika-kalpas. When we say the Purāņas are in a particular guna, it means that it is Śrī Viṣṇu who appears in these various kalpas in various gunas and expresses His personality in that way. The particular Purāņa then glorifies Him accordingly. Hence, the Purāņas are not imag- inary; they relate events as they occurred. But, as indicated in Brahma-kända, "Knowledge arises from sattva-guna" (sattvät sañjāyate jñānam, GĪTĀ 14.17), the sattvic Purāņas offer the most

Our conclusion has been substantiated by demonstrating that even qualities, such as splendor, mental power, cognitive power and sense power, are innate and exist eternally in Bhagavan.

IN THIS SECTION, Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī continues with the theme that the Lord's body, even when manifest in this world, is part of His essential nature and is thus not material. Devaki Devi's prayers in the previous anuccheda likened Bhagavan's factor of time to an all- devouring snake of death. The primary verse of this section refers to Śrī Ananta, who has the form of a snake and is also the cause of cos- mic dissolution. This is a further indication that Bhagavan is beyond death.

The verse under discussion is from the Fifth Canto, where it is found in the context of the description of the cosmos. There, after explaining the structure of the seven lower planetary systems, Śukadeva Gosvāmi describes the region below the lowest planet, Pātālaloka. Śrī Ananta, who has a thousand heads, is said to be 30,000 yojanās below Patalaloka, where he bears the planetary sys- tems comprising the bhu-mandala, compared therein to a mustard seed, on one of His hoods. After describing Lord Ananta, Śrī Suka recites five verses sung in His praise by Narada Muni before Śrī Brahma. Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi quotes only part of the first verse in this series; the complete verse is given here: 
How can one possibly know in reality the ways of the Lord, by whose glance the gunas of material nature, sattva, rajas and tamas, which are responsible for the creation, continuation and dissolution of this cosmos, are made to function? Though His form is permanent

(dhruva) and uncreated (akṛta), and one in Himself, it has become at this multiform cosmos. (SB 5.25.9) 13 
In this verse, the word dhruva (permanent) is interpreted by Śrīdhara Svāmī as meaning ananta (unending), and akṛta (uncre- ated) is defined as anadi (without beginning). Never was there a time when Bhagavan's form was created, nor will it ever be destroyed. In Vedic philosophy an object is called eternal if it is beginningless, anadi, and endless, ananta.

All objects or entities can be classified into four groups: 
ibenta 
1. Those which have no beginning but have an end. For example, d brs before an object, say a sweetball, is created, it does not exist. The 
non-existence of the sweetball has no beginning. But this non- ni kexistence comes to an end when the ball is produced. This is called Zaprāg-abhāva, or pre-non-existence; it is anadi, or beginningless, 
but has an end. 
Бле 
2. Those which have a beginning but no end. If a sweetball is con- sumed, it will then become non-existent. This is called post-non- existence, or pradhvaṁsa-abhava; the non-existence has a begin- ning but no end, so it is ananta. Liberation, or mukti, is another example of this.

This verse explains that Bhagavan's body has no end and no beginning. He is nitya. Although He is called ananta, He is also anādi - anadir ādir govindah. 
In this regard, a doubt may be raised. Even if His body has no beginning or end, it can still undergo transformation, like material

nature, which is also eternal. This verse indirectly denies this, how- ever, by stating that the mutation of the gunas occurs due to the glance of the Lord. This means two things: 
of the Lord is ming 
Tow 
1. The Lord existed before the gunas mutated. P2. The Lord does not undergo any change. 
The principle is that the agent is always different from the action. That Sri Ananta's body is transcendental is confirmed in Lord Siva's prayers, given in the course of a description of Jambudvipa and its nine divisions, found in chapters 16-17 of the Fifth Canto. It is related there that Lord Śiva is the only male on Ilavṛtavarṣa, and that he med- itates on Sankarṣaṇa. His prayers are comprised of eight verses, and in SB 5.17.19 he says that although the Lord glances at Māyā, He is not influenced by her, which means that His body is transcendental. 
Another doubt may be raised: In SB 5.17.16 Śrī Sankarṣaṇa's form is called tāmasī mūrti (lit., "whose form is in tamo-guna") and SB 5.25.1 states, yā vai kala bhagavatas tāmasi (lit., "the form of the Lord that is in tamo-guna"). These phrases clearly state that Sankar- sana's body is in tamo-guna. Additionally, the object of Śiva's med- itation (i.e., Sankarṣaṇa) is also worshiped by the daughters of the serpent king (SB 3.8.5). This is appropriate, as Sūta Gosvāmī else- where states that Śiva and serpents are in tamo-guna, and those who are in rajo-guna and tamo-guna worship deities in those particular gunas, due to commonality of nature (rajas-tamaḥ-prakrtayaḥ sama- śīlā bhajanti vai, SB 1.2.27). Hence, Sankarṣaṇa's form definitely has some connection to tamo-guna. 
In response to this, Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī cites the subsequent verse spoken by Śrī Nārada (SB 5.25.10), in which he says that out of great mercy upon us, the Lord has manifested this form, which is in pure sattva, sattvam saṁśuddham, and this material world, with its cause and effect, abides in Him. This Lord of all beings is most liberal and powerful, and He manifests His flawless pastimes just to attract the hearts of His devotees. The words sattvam samśuddham clearly assert that Bhagavan's form is in transcendental sattva, or unadulterated

being. SB 5.17.21 states that although Sri Ananta is the cause of cre- ation, maintenance and dissolution, He is free from these three (trib- hir vihinam). SB 5.17.16 refers to His form as tāmasi mūrtih, but also as turiya (lit., "the fourth"). Turiya means beyond the three gunas. This contradicts the literal meaning of the word tämasi murtiḥ. In com- menting on this verse, Śrīla Viśvanatha Cakravarti Thakura writes: 
Tāmasi means that Sri Ananta's body is the source of annihilation, which is in tamo-guna. But factually His body is turiya, or in the fourth dimension, beyond the three gunas of material nature. It is suddha-cinmaya, purely of the nature of consciousness.15 
This is also confirmed by Śri Maitreya: 
The original Lord Sankarṣaṇa, who has perfect knowledge, is situ- Mated at the bottom of the universe. (SB 3.8.3) 16 
ar bus 
A further objection may be raised about Śrī Vişnu's being eternal, free from birth and death. In Skanda Purana and Śiva Purana there are some stories that clearly indicate that Śrī Viṣṇu is not the sup- reme controller. They profess the supremacy of Śiva, Brahma and so on. One such example is found in Siva Purana: dl validig -dipash 
The sages said, "Even Śrī Brahma and Visnu bow down to him (Śiva) ant ra out of fear. He is the destroyer of the world and their controller. ChaPreviously he created Brahma and Visņu from the limbs of his Vis body, and he is their eternal well-wisher and master." (Vayaviya- for samhita 7.1.13-14)17 
es o 
Similarly, Devi-bhāgavata Purana 1.2.22 states that Devi creates Brahmā, Visnu and Siva18 Skanda Purana describes that when Śrī

Śrī Bhagavat Sandarbha 
Kṛṣṇa was shot by the hunter, Jara, He left His body and went to His abode: "He gave up His body and departed from the face of the earth."19 Furthermore, it states that His body was "cut to pieces by the hunter's arrows," and, "He gave up His body."20 Brahma Purāṇa also describes that after Śrī Kṛṣṇa was killed by the hunter Jarā, Arjuna performed the funeral rites for His dead body: no gaitnom 
At that time, Arjuna searched for the bodies of Śrī Kṛṣṇa and Balarama and cremated them. Then he also burned the bodies of other Yadavas. (Brahma Purana 212.1)21 
In light of such verses, how can Śrī Visņu's body be considered eternal? Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī says that these stories in the Purāņas are meant to propagate dry renunciation and the glorification of Lord Śiva and others; in other words, they are meant to conceal reality and not to reveal the Absolute Truth. Sections 17 and 18 of Tattva Sandarbha explained that the Purāņas are divided according to the gunas of sattva, rajas and tamas. This arrangement was made to attract those in all three gunas to the Vedic scriptures, and thus offer them suitable guidance in correspondence with their respective eli- gibility. In the Purāņas of the lower gunas, the glories of Śrī Vişnu are concealed. Yet they also contain implicit statements describ- ing Visnu's supremacy, because, ultimately, all scriptures glorify Śrī Visņu. This is elegantly stated in Skanda Purāṇa: 
filo In the beginning, middle and end of the Vedas, Rāmāyaṇa, Mahab- hārata and Purānas, Śri Hari alone is glorified. (Käsi-khanda 95.12)22

Śrimad Bhāgavatam also states, "All the Vedas explain Śrī Kṛṣṇa" (vasudeva-parā vedäḥ, SB 1.2.28). Śrī Kṛṣṇa also asserts, "By all the

Vedas I alone am to be known" (GITA 15.15)23 The indeclinable word eva (only) in this verse of Bhagavad Gitä is significant, because its use excludes all other deities. Since the Purānas and Itihāsas are supple- ments to the Vedas, the Lord's categorical statement implies that He is also the goal of these texts. 
People in the lower gunas have a natural affinity for, or faith in, the worship of lesser deities. This is called svabhāvajā śraddhā, or faith born of nature. In the seventh chapter of Bhagavad Gītā, Kṛṣṇa says that He strengthens the faith of such people. Why? Because He does not oppose the will of the living being. To deny their will would mean they would be deprived of the possibility of loving and serving Him voluntarily, and it is only freely-given love that pleases Him. So, as Paramātmā, He guides them internally, while externally offering them scriptural support, and thus they develop firm faith in the deity of their choice. Ultimately, such persons are never satis- fied, because the devas do not have the power to liberate them from the entanglement of karmic reactions, good or bad, or from material desires. Only Mukunda (Śrī Kṛṣṇa) can free living beings from the bondage of karma. Sooner or later they will realize this fact and take to devotion of Viṣṇu. 
That Skanda Purana and other lesser Purānas explain the glories of Śrī Kṛṣṇa is evident from the verse cited above. It is also illus- trated by the story of Ghaṇṭakarna narrated in Hari-vaṁśa Purāṇa. Ghaṇṭākarna was a great devotee of Lord Siva who was so averse to Visnu that he could not tolerate even hearing His name. He there- fore hung bells on his ears and whenever a sound carrying the glo- ries of Visņu entered within hearing range, he would shake his head to drown out the sound. Thus, he earned his name, which means, "one who has bells hanging from the ears." Ghanṭakarṇa performed severe austerities to please Śrī Śiva. After a long time, when Śiva finally appeared before him and offered him a boon, Ghaṇṭākarṇa prayed to be granted liberation. To his great dismay, Śiva informed him that only Visņu could grant him liberation and advised taking shelter of Him. So, Ghaṇṭakarna worshiped Śrī Kṛṣṇa and eventu- ally met Him at Badarikāśrama, where he spoke the following verse: 
23 
vedais ca sarvair aham eva vedyaḥ 
277 
JernshŚrī Bhagavat Sandarbha 
When I begged for liberation, the three-eyed Lord Siva told me that Han only Śri Viṣṇu can grant a person liberation, and that of this, there a 
can be no doubt. (Hari-vamsa Purāna 3.30.30)24 
When faced with such contradictory statements, we should take those that seem to minimize the supremacy of Śrī Visņu as invalid, because the elucidation of nirguna truth is not their specific concern. For perfect knowledge of the Absolute, one should consult sättvic Puranas, of which Srimad Bhagavatam is topmost, because it has no topic other than the Absolute Truth, Śrī Kṛṣṇa. According to Varaha Purāṇa, Śrī Viṣṇu ordered Lord Siva to create misleading scriptures: 
bluow you 
bas 
298 O Śiva, propagate misleading scriptures and establish that one can be 
attain great results by only a little effort. (Varaha Purana 70.36) 25 
The reason for this is that many persons of demoniac nature took birth in Kali as brāhmaṇas to destroy the Vedic religion. This is also stated in Caitanya-bhāgavata: 
In Kali, asuras will take birth as brahmanas. Born in brāhmaṇa fam- ilies, they will harass the weakened Vedic brahmanas. (Caitanya- bhāgavata 1.11.298) 26 
To allure such people away from the Vedas, Lord Siva created many Agamas and Tantras in the lower gunas. In the same chapter of Varaha Purana referred to above, Śiva revealed his purpose to the 
sages: 
Haman 2111 gainean nava 
-olyTo bewilder those who do not follow Vedic injunctions, I have cre-rol bseated new scriptures, called naya-siddhanta. (Varaha Purana 70.42)27 
On the same theme, Sukadeva Gosvāmī mentions in Bhagavatam that even great sages sometimes become bewildered and forget what 
24 muktim prarthyamanam mam punar aha trilocanaḥ

they have previously said. This point was made while Sukadeva was narrating the story of the battle waged between Śrī Kṛṣṇa and Salva. During the fight, Śrī Kṛṣṇa struck Śälva on the neck with His club, injuring him severely and causing him to vomit blood. The wounded enemy, who possessed great magical ability, suddenly disappeared into the sky. Then, after some time had elapsed, a strange person appeared before Śrī Kṛṣṇa, announcing that he had been sent by Mother Devaki to deliver a message, "Salva has captured Your father and carried him away like an animal."nimeombu 
Ish 
Hearing this, the Lord became morose and said, "Oh, how sur- prising that Śālva captured my father in the presence of Balarama, who cannot be defeated by anyone. Indeed, Fate is most powerful!" 
Then Sälva himself appeared before Kṛṣṇa with a false Vasudeva, created by his illusory powers, and beheaded him in front of the Lord. Seeing this, Śrī Kṛṣṇa was bereaved just like an ordinary man, until He realized that it had all been an illusion created by Salva.og 
After this narration, Sukadeva Gosvāmī said that some people speak incoherent words and contradict themselves.28 How is it possi- ble that the Supreme Lord can fall into illusion? The point is, rather, that sometimes even sages forget that Śrī Kṛṣṇa is transcendental and thus cannot become bewildered. Therefore, when such descrip- tions are found in the Purāņas or Itihāsas, they should be consid- ered as misleading and hence not accepted as literal, or as descrip- tive of higher-order truth, by the Vaisnavas. Thus, in Skanda Purāņa Lord Siva instructs his son that in scriptures dealing with his glory, only those statements that are consistent with the conclusions of the Vaiṣṇava scriptures should be accepted as authoritative. All other statements should be taken as the indirect glories of Śrī Viṣṇu, for since the gods are compared to the limbs of the cosmic form of the Lord, praise directed to them is considered indirect praise of Śrī Viṣṇu. 
Another explanation as to why such glorification of the devas exists is because all names originally belong to Śrī Viṣṇu. In the

xo Therefore, scriptures sometimes describe Kṛṣṇa directly and sometimes indirectly. Verses implying that Śrī Kṛṣṇa's body is mate- rial carry a secondary meaning. Such secondary statements require correct interpretation to bring them into coherence with the pri- mary statements that explain how Bhagavan's body is eternal. Peo- ple in general are very much attached to their bodies; therefore, to teach them renunciation, the Lord sometimes creates an illusory body before He departs from the world. This is to encourage ordi- nary people to think as follows: Even a person like Kṛṣṇa, who was most powerful and beautiful, who had 16,000 queens and unlim- ited opulence and relatives, had to leave everything at the time of death. So why should we remain attached to our bodies and their by-products?

sid Lo Bhagavan, who creates millions of universes, can easily create an illusory body that resembles His real body. Sometimes such descrip- tions of Krsna's death are to be interpreted as indirect statements, or parokṣa-vāda. According to Srimad Bhagavatam, the topmost author- ity for the Vaisnavas, Śrī Kṛṣṇa left the world in the self-same body: 
Without burning up His all-attractive body by the yogic process of concentration on the fire element, which is the most auspicious object of contemplation and meditation, Śrī Kṛṣṇa entered His own abode. (SB 11.31.6)30

rly liberate from other actions, just as a father promises his child candy 
to make him take his medicine. (SB 11.3.44)31ogs 
snto 
vo/SME 
Furthermore, Śrī Kṛṣṇa says that He has a liking for this paroksa- vāda. He told Uddhava: 
The primary subject of the Vedas, which are divided into three parts [namely the Karma-kāṇḍa, Upāsanā-kāṇḍa and Jñāna-kāṇḍa]," is knowledge of the self and Brahman. The Vedic seers, however, convey their meaning indirectly, and I am pleased by such indirect explanations. (SB 11.21.35)32 
The purpose of Vedic literature is to educate humanity, bālānām anusāsanam. The teachings are given according to people's receptiv- ity. But the scriptural statements are not false. They are authentic, yet their purpose, lying beyond the grasp of mind and intellect, must be understood from a genuine wisdom-teacher. Otherwise, their importance is minimized, śruti-śästra-nindana, by failing to honor the method of reception they themselves prescribe, and thus the truth they disclose remains concealed. 
The word kalpa is another example of parokṣa-vada. The word kalpa has various meanings. One prominent meaning is a period of time, equal to a day of Brahma. Thus, the word tāmasa-kalpa would mean a day of Brahma that is in tamo-guna. But this seems quite improper. Śrī Kṛṣṇa says that He appears in every millennium to propagate religion (GĪTĀ 4.7-8). Moreover, He says that He appears whenever there is decline in religion. His purpose in coming into the material world is to give Vedic knowledge. According to Laghu- bhāgavatamṛta, there are 41 major avataras in each day of Brahma:

oal Adding the kalpāvatāras (25), manvantarāvatāras (12), and yuga- avataras (4), there are a total of 41 avataras in a day of Brahma.

Later on, Rūpa Gosvāmī says that generally in all kalpas the same avatāras appear, and ordinarily they have the same names and perform similar activities.34 Sometimes there is minor varia- tion. Besides this, Śrī Caitanya appears in the 28th Kaliyuga of the 7th Manu in each day of Brahma to propagate harinama-saṁkīrtana. Moreover, Śrī Sūta Gosvāmi says that the Lord makes unlimited 
appearances: 
O brahmanas, the avataras of the Lord, who is an ocean of sattva (sattva-nidhi), are without number, just like the rivulets that flow from inexhaustible bodies of water. (SB 1.3.26)35 
monMbd vah 
In commenting on the phrase sattva-nidheḥ, Śrila Sanatana Gosvāmī writes in his Dig-darśini-tikā to Bṛhad-bhāgavatamṛta 1.5.8, "Sattva here means the supreme mercy of Bhagavan, and that is why He has unlimited appearances in the material world."36 Supreme mercy here means to bestow transcendental knowledge so that the living beings can become free from ignorance, the root cause of all their miseries. It is for this reason that the Lord appears in the material world again and again. 
In light of this, it would be highly illogical to think that some kalpas are tāmasic and others rājasic. Furthermore, Brahmā has thirty days in a month, and the names of each day, beginning with śveta-varaha-kalpa, are mentioned in Skanda Purana. There is no mention of a tamasa-kalpa or rājasa-kalpa in this list. The same names are repeated in each month, like the days of the week or the dates of a month. 
(abstwoint sibov avis oral blow ichitem ad We are therefore forced to seek out a different meaning for kalpa. According to Medini 1.12.2, a Sanskrit glossary, one of the popular meanings of kalpa is sastra, or scriptural statement. This was also established in Tattva Sandarbha.37 This matches with the statements 
34

from Padma Purāņa and Matsya Purana that divide the Purāņas into three gunas according to their subject matter. Therefore, the mean- ing of the phrase tamasa-kalpa-katha-maya should be taken as, "hav- ing descriptions that are in the gunas of tamas." This topic will be discussed in greater detail in Paramatma Sandarbha, Anuccheda 16. 
Therefore, it is concluded that all scriptures ultimately glorify Śrī Viṣṇu. The Śruti states, "All the Vedas lead to that one place" (sarve veda yat padam amananti, KU 1.2.15). Śrī Visnu has an eternal body and His attributes never undergo any transformations.

३१ | विभुत्वमाह (भा० १० ।९।१३-१४) - 
ŚRI SUKA DELINEATES the Lord's all-pervading aspect as follows: 
न चान्तर्न बहिर्यस्य न पूर्वं नापि चापरम् । पूर्वापरं बहिश्चान्तर्जगतो यो जगच् च यः ॥ १३१ ॥ तं मत्वात्मजमव्यक्तं मर्त्यलिङ्गमधोक्षजम् । गोपिकोलूखले दाम्ना बबन्ध प्राकृतं यथा ॥ १३२ ॥ 
Thinking Kṛṣṇa to be her own son, the cowherd woman, Yasoda, bound Him to a mortar with a rope like an ordinary child - He who has neither inside nor outside, neither front nor back, who exists in front of the cosmos and behind it, who is both within and without it, who, indeed, is Himself the cosmos, and who, though Jaunmanifest and beyond sense perception, had still appeared as a 
human being. (SB 10.9.13-14)1

31 Bhagavan's Body Is All-pervading 
Śridhara Svāmi comments here: "Tying an object requires encir- cling it completely with a rope. This can be done only with objects that have a beginning and an end, by holding the rope at one end and bringing it around the object to be bound, and then binding it to the other end. To show that this is not possible in the case of the Lord, śukadeva says, 'He who has neither inside nor outside; nei- ther front nor back. Moreover, only a tie that extends (vyāpaka) beyond the length of another object (vyapya) can bind it. To show that in Kṛṣṇa's case it is just the opposite, Sukadeva says, 'He who exists in front of the cosmos and behind it, who is both within and without it.' Furthermore, to show that Kṛṣṇa cannot be bound, since nothing exists without Him, Suka says, 'He who, indeed, is Himself the cosmos.' Yet Yasoda bound Him, who, though appear- ing human, is beyond the reach of the senses, thinking Him to be her son." 
जगच् च यः इत्यत्र यस्य कारणस्य व्यतिरेकेण कार्यस्य जगतो व्यतिरेकः स्यादिति । तदनन्यस्य जगतस्तच्छक्त्यैव शक्तेस्तदंशांशरूपया रज्ज्वा कथं तस्य बन्धः स्यात् ? न हि वह्निमर्चिषो दहेयुरिति भावः ।

The statement, jagac ca yah (He who is Himself the cosmos) means that Krsna is the cause of the cosmos. Without Him, the effect, in the form of the cosmos, could not exist. The cosmos is nondiffer- ent from Him, being His energy. How then could it be possible to bind Him with a rope, which is nothing more than a portion of a portion of His energies? The flame can never burn its source, fire. 
“तं मर्त्यलिङ्गम्” इत्यादौ टीकाकृतामयमभिप्रायः । ननु सर्वव्यापकं कथं बबन्ध । न हि ब्रह्माण्डगोलकादिकमपि कश्चिद् बध्नाति ? तत्राह - मर्त्यलिङ्गं मनुष्यविग्रहम् । 
The import of Sridhara Svämi's commentary on the statement, "He who had appeared as a human being" (martya-linga), is as fol- lows: How could Yaśoda bind Him, who is all-pervading ? After all, no one can bind even the shell of the universe. To quell such a doubt, Suka answers that He has a human form, martya-linga. तर्हि कथं व्यापकत्वम् ? तत्राह - अधोक्षजम् अधःकृतमिन्द्रियजं ज्ञानं येन तं सर्वेन्द्रियज्ञा- नागोचरं प्रत्यक्षादिप्रमाणैरचिन्त्यस्वरूपमित्यर्थः । तस्मात् तदाकारत्वेऽपि तस्मिन् विभु- त्वमस्त्येवेति भावः । अधोक्षजत्वादेवाव्यक्तत्वमपि व्याख्यातमिति तन् नोद्धृतम् ।

One may then wonder: If He does have human form, how can He be all-pervading? In answer, Suka says, He is "beyond sense perception" (adhokṣaja). In other words, He is that Being, in regard to whom, knowledge derived from sense-perception is rendered useless; which is to say, He is imperceptible to all sensory knowledge. His form is inconceivable by direct percep- tion and other such means. Therefore, despite His human form, He is certainly all-pervading. By understanding His adhokṣaja attribute, His imperceptibility to the material senses, the word "unmanifest" (avyakta) is automatically explained and is, there- fore, not referred to separately in Sridhara Svāmi's commentary. zi basbati odw Havs lue miH juodiw atalxs gridson aute ननु मनुष्यविग्रहत्वेऽप्यपरित्यक्तविभुत्वं कथं मातुर्नास्फुरत् ? तत्राह - आत्मजं मत्वा इति । वत्सलाद्यभिधप्रेमरसविशेषस्य स्वभावोऽयम् । यदसौ स्वानन्दपूरेण तस्य तादृ- शत्वं प्रत्यनुभवपद्धतिमावृणोतीत्यर्थः । इत्थं चातद्द्वीर्यकोविदत्वं तस्या माहात्म्यमेव तं रज्जुभिर्बद्धमपि कर्तुस्तस्य प्रेमरसस्यानुभावरूपत्वात् । तदुक्तम् "नेमं विरिञ्चो न भवः” ( भा० १०।९।२० ) इत्यादि । 
But how is it that this all-pervading aspect, belonging even to His human form, was not perceived by His mother? Suka answers, "Thinking Kṛṣṇa to be her own son" (atmajam matva). This is the nature of the transcendental love-ecstasy (prema-rasa) that goes by names such as parental love or nurturing (vätsalya), which covers the knowledge faculty with its own inherent all- encompassing bliss, so that features like His all-pervasiveness cannot be perceived. Yasoda's inability to detect Kṛṣṇa's majes- tic opulence is indeed glorious, because it was an anubhava, or an external manifestation of inner ecstasy, arising out of her permanent loving rasa for Kṛṣṇa, the very love that made it pos- sible for her to bind Him with rope. As a result, Śrī Suka later glorifies her love in the following words, "Not Brahma, not Śiva, nor even Laksmi, whose abode is on the Lord's chest, obtained from Kṛṣṇa, the bestower of liberation, mercy such as that which Mother Yasoda received" (SB 10.9.20)?

The phrases, “like an ordinary mortal” (prākrtar yathā), and, “beyond sense perception” (adhoksaja), refute any possibility that in spite of being all-pervading in reality, He may have appeared as a human being by the agency of māyā, or illusion. Sometimes in the realm of material logic a paradox occurs that appears to defy the laws of nature or conventional experience; such instances are generally taken as the play of māyā. But to reduce phenomena that are naturally beyond logic to mere products of māyā is gross foolishness, just as it is foolish to consider as illusion (aindraja- lika), the brilliance of the fire, emanating from the undersea vol- cano (bādava), which is displayed within the ocean water. The Vedas also declare, "The gods emanated from Him, but who knows His origin?””

Moreover, Suka's intention is to assert that the very same body that was bound is all-pervading, since the relative pronouns yasya (whose) and ya (who) denote the same object as their co- relatives, tasya, tat, in the verses, as they all refer to this form of Kṛṣṇa. This is also evidenced from the fact that Suka points out Mother Yasoda's lack of capacity to recognize His all-pervading aspect in the very same body. Only a limited object can have a form, because a form is a patterned arrangement of limbs, such as hands and legs. Therefore, the feature of being limited, and

that of being all-pervasive, both exist in Him simultaneously. It has already been demonstrated, as an axiomatic truth, that Bhagavan is the seat of hundreds of mutually conflicting poten- cies. Indeed, this is experienced even in the material world in the realm of Ayurvedic herbs that have the power to subdue opposing dosas [the three basic causes for all disease] simultaneously.

Commentary 
IN THE LAST TWO SECTIONS, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi has shown that the Lord's body (śrī-vigraha) is part of His essential nature. It is eter- nal and nondifferent from Him. Now he begins to establish that this body is not limited to, or bound by, spatial or temporal laws. This is one of the Lord's inconceivable attributes. Our unfailing experience is that a person's body exists in a particular three-dimensional space at a particular point in time; it is limited by space and, therefore, can neither exist in two places simultaneously nor pervade everything. 
Since the Absolute is by definition nondual being-awareness, existing everywhere at all times, certain philosophers attempt to establish that the Absolute cannot be other than unqualified all- pervading Brahman. Imposing conventional experience on God, they fail to grasp the inconceivable character of the Lord's body and conclude that it must be material. The Absolute Truth, however, is never subject to our mundane sensory experience. Śrī Jiva has already established this in an earlier section. The Absolute Truth is 
maya tatam idam sarvam jagad avyakta-mūrtinā mat-sthani sarva-bhūtāni na caham teşv avasthitaḥ na ca mat-sthani bhūtāni paśya me yogam aiśvaram bhūta-bhṛn na ca bhūta-stho mamatma bhūta-bhāvanaḥ 
29031 Bhagavan's Body Is All-pervading 
inconceivable, and our conventional experience, scientific laws and logical extrapolations are inadequate to comprehend or define the transcendental realm.tr ai ter qu hodilo bad sHisdi 
Any proposition that runs contrary to this premise is specula- tive theory, because its validity claims have no application in the realm of nondual being. Such theories are woven in the brain and are bound to collapse no matter how well spun. If a seeker simply admits his limitations in this regard and humbly hears about the Absolute Truth in the parampara system of authority, he saves himself much wasted effort.

Because the concept of a person existing beyond time and space is a very difficult one to grasp, on account of our deep-seated material conditioning, Śrila Jīva Gosvāmi spends considerable time explain- ing it from various angles. This section is just an introduction to the topic, which will continue up to Anuccheda 42. 
Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi uses the word vibhutva for all-pervasiveness. This word literally means "greatness," or "prowess," but in phi- losophy it conveys the meaning of sarva-gatatva, or "going every- where."10 The author wants to show that the Lord exists everywhere in His personal form, and not simply through His energy. This is accompanied by an example from the Tenth Canto of Śrīmad Bhāga- vatam, where Śrī Suka narrates the story of Krsna's being bound by Mother Yasoda. 
One day Mother Yasoda was churning yogurt in a clay pot to make butter, baby Kṛṣṇa's favorite food. As she worked, she recalled and recited her divine son's enchanting pastimes, so her mind, body and speech were all engaged in serving Him. While she was busy with her work, Śrī Kṛṣṇa came to her to drink her breast milk. 
Mother Yasoda began nursing Him, but the milk she had been boiling on the stove began to overflow. She stopped feeding Kṛṣṇa and quickly ran to save the milk. Krsna thought His mother was showing more regard for the milk than for Him, and so He angrily broke the clay yogurt pot, and then went to another room where He started eating the previous day's butter.

by When Yasoda returned, she saw the broken pot and recognized it as Kṛṣṇa's mischief-making. She went looking for Him and found that He had climbed up onto a mortar in order to reach a butter pot hanging from a rafter, and was sharing the contents with the mon- keys. Indignant and determined to punish Him for His misbehavior, she picked up a stick. When Kṛṣṇa saw how angry His mother was, He became frightened and ran away. Mother Yasoda gave chase and was able to catch Him only with great difficulty. She caught hold of His hand and began chastising Him. Śrī Kṛṣṇa sobbed piteously, trembling and rubbing His eyes. Seeing Him so full of fear, Yasoda threw the stick away and decided to tie Him to the mortar to prevent Him from doing any more mischief. 
The above narration from Bhāgavatam precedes the two princi- pal verses that form the basis of this anuccheda. The first explains why Mother Yasoda was unable to bind Kṛṣṇa, the second how she succeeded.

Tying an object requires encircling it completely with a rope. The object must be contained within the rope, and the rope must be out- side the object. Sukadeva Gosvāmī says, however, that Śrī Kṛṣṇa has neither inside nor outside (na cantar na bahir yasya). This means that nothing exists outside of Him. His body is formed of pure, con- densed bliss and has neither flesh or bones inside, nor skin outside. This is substantiated by Rukmini Devi, who speaks the following to Kṛṣṇa:

to be localized, it is simultaneously all-pervading, like ether. As such, it has no divisions, no beginning or ending point - na pūrvaṁ napi căparam. His body is not limited by space. of autodrom all as HoŚukadeva next says that the Lord's form is purvāpara - it existed before the creation and will exist after annihilation. This implies that it is not limited by time. There was never a time when He did not exist, nor will there ever be a time when He ceases to exist. The Lord related this to Brahma: 
I alone existed before all this, when there was nothing else, neither cause nor effect. After creation, this too is I. And in the end, I alone will remain. (SB 2.9.32)12 
Here "I" refers to Bhagavan's personal form and not to His inde- terminate feature, which, being devoid of attributes, is formless. The verse goes on to say that Krsna is the universe (jagac ca yaḥ), and thus not limited by any object. How can a rope, which is an insignif- icant part of the universe, bind the Lord, who is the source of mil- lions of such universes? He is not only within the universe but also outside it. Anything not limited by time, space, or other objects is all-pervading and not pervaded by anything else. In other words, the Lord's form is unlimited and, therefore, cannot be bound. 
The obvious question arises, "How then was He bound?" He was certainly bound even though He has all the above attributes. He is called Damodara, or one who was bound around the waist. This is confirmed in Hari-vaṁśa Purana 2.7.14: "She (Yaśodā) tied ropes around His belly (udara), and then tied the rope to a mortar" (damnă caivodare baddhva pratyabandhad ulukhale. How can an insignificant rope bind the One who is the source of unlimited universes?hild 
The Bhagavatam verse explains that Śrī Kṛṣṇa is martya-linga, He appeared as a human child. Otherwise, Mother Yasoda could not even have considered trying to tie Him up. She did not realize that her son is all-pervading, and this is because He is adhokṣaja - beyond sense perception.

ZA Ordinary persons cannot perceive the transcendental Lord, but Mother Yasoda is not an ordinary person, for the Lord accepted her as His mother due to her love for Him. Why then was she unable to recognize that Krsna could not be bound? The verse says that out of love she thought of Him as her own son (tam matvātmajam). As a result, Kṛṣṇa reciprocated appropriately and, in order to do so, con- cealed His divine opulences. This is in keeping with Krsna's own statement in GĪTĀ 4.11: 
Embed or all balen brod 
I reveal Myself to all who surrender unto Me, exactly in accordance with the essential nature of their surrender13 
When Bhagavan exhibits His enchanting human-like pastimes, He conceals His divine opulence (aiśvarya) and thus the devotee does not recognize Him as God. Of all the characteristics of the Abso- lute Truth, this feature of Bhagavan is perhaps the most difficult to understand for those still affected by material consciousness, and yet it is the most wonderful of all. 
The extraordinary characteristic of the pure love found in the res- idents of Vraja is that it covers Kṛṣṇa's aiśvarya, or the majesty of His Godhood. Śrī Caitanya explains this to Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī: 
der The pure love of the unalloyed devotee has no awareness of Kṛṣṇa's 26 divine nature. Even though such a devotee may see Kṛṣṇa's Godly characteristics, He considers only his relationship with Him to be aid important. (cc 2.19.203) od 25w ofw sho bom60 balle 21 
14 
The deeper the devotee's love, the thicker the covering of formal knowledge. For instance, in this world also, a mother and father, blinded by parental love, will think that their child needs their care and guidance, even if that child has become prime minister and has millions of other people dependent on her or him. In the material world, however, it is not possible for someone to remain a child and continually nourish such vatsalya feelings in his or her parents. The Lord, on the other hand, being omnipotent, performs this feat by His

inconceivable power called yoga-maya. He is able to satisfy His devo- tee perfectly. This is the import of the all-important Gită verse cited above.yenes hosanoriranduol 
babesq 
Such absence of awareness of (or simply absence of concern for) the Lord's Godhood should not be considered a defect in the devo- tee, but rather a glory. The more love one has for the Lord, the blinder one is to His majesty, knowledge of which leads to reverence but not intimacy. As knowledge of majesty (aiśvarya) increases, the intensity of intimacy (madhurya) decreases, and vice versa. show 
In conditional existence such ignorance of God's majesty would be considered the root defect, but on the transcendental plane it is a glorious attribute. This secret is known only to rare souls like Suka- deva, and thus he makes Mother Yasoda's glories known to the world. It is significant that after narrating this pastime, he did not glorify Kṛṣṇa's quality of being both limited and unlimited simultaneously, nor His yogic power, but yearned, rather, in a rapturous mood for the mercy Śrī Kṛṣṇa had awarded to Yasoda, a mercy unattainable by Brahma, Śiva, or even Lakṣmi Devi herself. siery SHER 
In actuality, devotees like Mother Yasoda are not really in igno- rance of the Lord's Godhood; it is just that due to their intense love, they pay very little attention to Bhagavan's majestic aspect, or, in other words, to His formal station as God. They have no personal needs to satisfy by that opulence or mystic power. Their only desire is to love and serve Him in accordance with the permanent and dom- inant emotion that defines their love, so aiśvarya (or formal God- hood) is not very important to them. As a matter of fact, the desire to serve diminishes as the awareness of aiśvarya increases, for such an omnipotent and complete God has no need of anything, what to speak of the service of an infinitesimal spark of consciousness. So, even when Bhagavan reveals His formal opulence in the course of His lilā, His devotee interprets it in a way that does not disrupt the flow of devotion, like thinking that such miracles must be the result of some sage or god's blessing upon Him. 
Brahma is born from the lotus navel of the Lord without any par- ticipation from Lakṣmi Devi. One of man's strongest desires is called putraiṣaṇā, to have a son whom he considers to be his very self (ātmā 
295 
yle Śri Bhagavat Sandarbha 
vā jāyate putra). A father feels especially pleased with a son who is well-behaved and highly qualified. Brahma was certainly such a son, as he performed austerities for one thousand celestial years and pleased the Lord to the extent that the Lord shook hands with him15 
15 
Brahma is considered the ādi-guru, as stated by Śrī Śuka, "He [Brahma] is the original god and the supreme preceptor in the uni- verse" (sa ādi-devo jagatām paro guruḥ, SB 2.9.5). Nevertheless, not even Brahma could obtain the kind of blessings that Mother Yaśodā received from the Lord. He thus prayed to take birth as an insignifi- cant creeper in the land of Vraja so that he could be bathed in the dust of the lotus feet of its residents, whose life and soul is Śrī Mukunda." 
Similarly, Lord Siva is the ideal devotee - vaiṣṇavānāṁ yathā sambhuḥ (SB 12.13.16) - yet he could not engage in loving sports with Śrī Kṛṣṇa. The Goddess of Fortune, Lakṣmi, always resides on the chest of Śrī Visņu and is, therefore, called anapayinī, one who is never separated from the Lord. Though She has such direct personal association, she still cannot relish the enchanting sports of Bhaga- vān's Vraja līlā. She performed austerities in an attempt to enter therein, but was not rewarded favorably: 002 
Jauj ai si thondboa

evol ni We do not know, O Lord, by whose mercy Kaliya has attained the ri Ism right to touch the dust of Your feet. For when Laksmi, who is so dear to You, desired to obtain this mercy, She performed austerities, giv- ing up all other desires, and remained fixed in Her vows for so very long, [but was still not successful]. (SB 10.16.36)"

31 Bhagavan's Body Is All-pervading 
Sankarācārya's school of Radical Nondualism interprets these verses as indicating that the Absolute Truth, the all-pervading Brah- man, accepts a human form under the influence of māyā. This is not a sound proposal, as it defies both scriptures and logic. These two verses state that both He who has neither inside nor outside (näntar bahiḥ) and He who was bound are one and the same person. A rela- tive pronoun must always have an antecedent with which it is con- nected. In Sanskrit, this rule is stated as yat-tador nitya-sambandhaḥ. In the first of the above two verses, a series of subordinate clauses using relative pronouns is given; their antecedent, the boy Kṛṣṇa who was bound by Mother Yasoda, is named in the second verse. ad The conclusion is that the all-pervading Absolute Truth must be the very child who was bound by Mother Yasoda. If this was not Sukadeva's intention, what would have been the need for the first of the two verses? Nothing specific would have been conveyed; on the contrary, it would merely create confusion in the reader. Even though an ordinary human body is limited, the Lord's body is all-pervasive, in spite of its apparent conformance to human proportions.is most allid seque-hanbad souborgagning old Furthermore, Śrī Jīva Prabhu warns that one should not think that Krsna's being tied up was an illusion or a magic trick. Were it so, Śrī Suka would have no reason to glorify Mother Yasoda and estab- lish her superiority to Lord Siva and Śrī Brahma, who can accom- plish plenty of amazing magical feats. If the Lord were devoid of inconceivable potencies, it could then be taken as magic. In Sec- tions 15 to 19, however, it was established that the Lord has nat- ural inconceivable potencies, some of which oppose one another, ätmeśvaro'tarkya-sahasra-saktih (SB 3.33.3). To subject these incon- ceivable potencies to the parameters of mundane logic is sheer fool- ishness. They should be accepted on the authority of sabda-pramāṇa, or revealed sound. quod lit asumbos aids bus absqxs J 
Even the mundane world exhibits inconceivable occurrences. According to Ayurveda, diseases are caused by an imbalance in the tri-dosas in the body - mucus, bile and wind, as stated in Aṣṭānga- hṛdaya, an important Ayurveda textbook's These three dosas have 
sarveṣām eva rogānāṁ nidanam kupitā malāḥ 
297 
the Sri Bhagavat Sandarbhad 
characteristics that oppose one another. For example, mucus is sweet and fatty; bile, sour and bitter; and wind, dry. This means that sweet foods increase the mucus in the body, while bitter and sour foods increase bile, and so on. When there is an imbalance in one of these dosas, it creates disease in the body. Ayurveda recom- mends medicinal herbs that re-balance the dosas. based 
The point to note, however, is that herbs that reduce mucus will increase bile, or vice versa, because mucus is cold and bile hot. In some cases, a person may have a disturbance in all three dosas and is administered herbs that will re-balance them. From a logical point of view, it should be impossible for any single herb to possess prop- erties that are self-contradictory, but Ayurveda recommends herbs like haritaki, which has the power to quell all three dosas simultane- ously. Though this is inconceivable and contrary to logic, it must be accepted on the authority of sabda-pramāna, in this case, the autho- rized knowledge of Ayurveda, and experience shows that it works. 
Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi defines illusion as something impossible that is still within the range of reason. For example, a magician may seemingly produce hundred-rupee bills from thin air. It seems like an impossible act and contrary to reason, but if he were actually able to produce money out of nothing, he would most likely not be per- forming a magic act to earn a living! Moreover, he would probably be arrested by the police, as only an agency like the Reserve Bank of India has the authority to issue currency. In such a case, we have to accept that the magician's act can be explained as nothing more than sleight of hand. jadi badaildetes as t

On the other hand, phenomena inconceivable to the rational mind may not always be illusory. For instance, objects generally expand when heated and contract when cooled. But water displays anomalous behavior when cooled below 4 °C. Instead of contracting, it expands, and this continues till o°C. Though this is outside the normal bounds of logic, to consider it illusion would be foolish. 
vswod 
Jiva Prabhu gives the example of the undersea volcanic fire, called bāḍava. It cannot be considered illusory because it is described in scriptures, in particular, in chapter 179 of Caitraratha- parva of Mahabharata. Aurva Rṣi wanted to destroy the kṣatriya

kings, but his forefathers intervened. On their request, he threw his anger into the ocean and it there manifested as the baḍava or aurva fire. Since this event actually occurred, the fire should not be con- sidered illusory, though it may appear to be somewhat inconsistent with the realm of reason. 
When we discover that the things of this world sometimes have inconceivable or self-contradictory characteristics, it is easy to understand that Bhagavan, who is the source of the entire material and spiritual worlds, must also possess such inconceivable poten- cies. There is thus no need to consider His body material, or this pas- time of His being bound as illusory. Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi concludes, therefore, that the very same body that was bound with ropes is all-pervading. In this lila, Śrī Kṛṣṇa demonstrated that His body can be inconceivably, yet simultaneously, limited and all-pervading. Acceptance of this inconceivable nature of the Supreme Person is the fundamental and essential premise required for understanding the Supreme Lord's personhood.us bamisel to

NOW WE BEGIN A NEW SECTION to further establish that the Lord's form is simultaneously limited and all-pervading, by referring to the experience of learned authorities, using the ukta-poșa- nyaya, or the principle of fortifying previous experience. First, Śrī Brahmā spoke the following eleven verses' confirming what we have seen in the previous anuccheda:

30032 Bhagavan's Form Is Unlimited 
Commentary quros.ogaard.bosbliwed vllaze saw Andesid to haduerte, gnised along at gigged loud ads of bayang nas AFTER DEMONSTRATING IN THE PREVIOUS SECTION, that Śrī Kṛṣṇa's body is unlimited, though apparently limited, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi now cites the experience of Śrī Brahma to bolster his argument. Śrī Brahma is known as veda-garbha, the repository and teacher of the four Vedas, and thus he is in complete knowledge of the essence of the Vedic scriptures. Moreover, though his four heads imply that he is all-seeing, he could still be confounded by Kṛṣṇa, so what to speak of ordinary human beings. By showing that Brahma is in agree- ment with his own conclusions, Jiva Gosvāmī seeks to firmly estab- lish his point about the Lord's personal form. So, in this section, he quotes a series of eleven verses from Śrī Brahma's prayers to Kṛṣṇa in chapter 14 of the Tenth Canto. 
Śrī Brahmā spoke these verses after trying to test Śrī Kṛṣṇa. When Śrī Kṛṣṇa entered the snake body of Aghasura, the personi- fication of sin, the demon's soul left his body and hung in the air, waiting for the Lord to come out. This created a dazzling light that illuminated the entire universe. While the other gods celebrated the demise of the demon, Śrī Brahma's attention was captured by this effulgence. Searching for the source of the radiant light, he descended and was astounded to witness the liberation of Agha- sura. He had previously heard that a sinful person may sometimes be awarded liberation, but he never imagined that sin personified could be so fortunate. Moreover, this feat (of awarding liberation) had not been accomplished by a person of extraordinary appearance, with four arms or a thousand heads, but by a mere boy. Adsiä 
Brahma's curiosity was aroused and so he decided to test Kṛṣṇa in order to witness further pastimes. He stole Kṛṣṇa's calves and friends and then returned after just a moment in the reckoning of his own time dimension to see how Śrī Kṛṣṇa was handling the sit- uation. By the earth's time scale, however, it was a year later. Just imagine his surprise when he saw that all the calves and cowherd boyfriends were still sporting with Kṛṣṇa as before. Yet that was nothing compared to what ensued: as he watched, they all turned into four-armed Visņu forms. 
301 
Śri Bhagavat Sandarbha 
Brahma was totally bewildered, his ego completely smashed. He then prayed to the Lord, begging His pardon for having disturbed His play. These twelve verses are taken from his prayers. Their sig- nificance is that in them Brahma testifies from his own experience that the apparently limited form of Bhagavan is actually unlimited. 
In the first verse selected (SB 10.14.11), Śrī Brahma expresses how insignificant he is in comparison to the Lord. He explains that his body is within this universe, which is covered with seven layers — mahat, aham, sky, air, fire, water and earth. The width of the inner- most layer is ten times the diameter of the universe, and each sub- sequent layer is ten times thicker than the previous one. Maitreya Muni states: dal 2 an

The egg-shaped universe, constituted as it is of the eight causal prin- ciples and the sixteen evolutes, has a breadth of five million yojanas (40 million miles) and is covered outside by seven sheaths, each of which is ten times thicker than the one it surrounds, and is clustered 
together with other universes in their millions. (SB 3.11.40-41)3otish 
Brahma is just one tiny fragment within this universal egg along with all its coverings, and there are unlimited such eggs clustered in space. As he explains here, as well as in Brahma-samhita, these unlimited gigantic universes emanate from the pores of Mahāviṣṇu, just like atomic dust particles seen in the sunlight shining through a window. From this, one can just imagine the immense size of Śrī Mahāviṣṇu's body. If an unlimited number of universes exist in His body, then His body must certainly be unlimited. If even Brahma cannot fathom this with his four heads, how can an ordi- nary person with just a single head gauge the size of the Lord's body? And yet some bewildered people consider themselves, or others like themselves, to be God. moms jau banoro bar has shirts!

the extended thumb and little finger. This distance is also equal to the width of the four fingers multiplied by three, or twelve fingers. According to Samudrika-śästra, the science of physiognomy, a nor- mal person measures seven vitastis, or 84 fingers, according to the size of his own hand. The Lord's body, however, is nine vitastis, or 108 fingers in height, and such a body is called nyagrodha-parimandala, a mark of greatness and beauty. 
In this verse, the use of the word kva (where?) twice is a rhetor- ical device (on the one hand [...] yet, on the other [...]) that Brahma uses to emphasize the vast difference between himself and the Supreme Lord.

lunch. He likens Bhagavan to a pregnant woman because the cre- ation is held within Him. The child in the womb sometimes kicks, but this does not offend the mother; rather, she feels delighted that her baby is alive and kicking. Brahma entreats the Lord to regard his act of stealing the calves and cowherd boys as an innocent kick on the part of His son.della hade bara beadgir 
Brahma addresses Bhagavan as Adhokṣaja, or one who is beyond sense perception. This implies that he committed offenses because he was not able to recognize the Lord with his imperfect senses. To confirm their relation, Brahma expresses that the Lord's abdomen is unlimited and that nothing exists outside it. Both existence (asti) and non-existence (năsti) are within Him. Asti can also refer to con- scious objects and nästi to inert objects, which are in permanent flux within the Lord's body. There is no other existence to be found outside of Bhagavan. Kṛṣṇa confirms this in Bhagavad Gita: 
Understand that as the mighty wind, blowing everywhere, rests always in the sky, all created beings rest in Me. (GITA 9.6)5 
The clear implication of Śrī Brahma's verse is that all existence is within the body of the Lord, yet that same Lord is standing before 
et that same Lord is standing ber Brahma as a small child.

After comparing Kṛṣṇa to a pregnant woman, however, Brahma fears that Kṛṣṇa may object because He is male. In the subsequent verse, therefore, he refers to Krsna as his father. Or, if Kṛṣṇa were to respond that a mother delivers her baby, but when did He deliver Brahma? Then Brahma counters that he has also been delivered, "I was born from You" (vinirgato'smi).mol behong 
Then the Lord questions Brahma, "But you are called aja (unborn), so how can you have taken birth?" 
Brahma's response is that the scriptures say so, and they can- not be wrong, vāṁ na vai mṛṣā. Nārāyaṇa Upaniṣad states, "Brahma takes birth from Nārāyaṇa" (nārāyaṇād brahmā jāyate, Nārāyaṇa Upanisad 1). Kṛṣṇa declares in GITA 9.17:

In Brahma's case this is especially true, for Śrī Nārāyaṇa is both his mother as well as his father. Because Brahma takes birth from the lotus growing from the Lord's navel, Bhagavan is also his grand- father. He addresses the Lord as Iśvara, which means that He has inconceivable power and can thus be both mother and father at the same time.

Śrīdhara Svāmi also reads the last line as tac capi satyam na, tavaiva māyā whereas Jiva reads tac capi satyam, na tavaiva maya. Thus, the Gita Press edition reads as follows, "Are You not actually Nārāyaṇa, since You are the life and soul of all living beings? Nay, You are their prompter as well as the witness of all creatures. The celebrated Śrī Nārāyaṇa, so-called because He has His abode in things produced out of nara, as well as in the waters evolved out of Him, constitutes a form of Yours. Your appearing in a finite form, however, is not true; it is a merely Your play." Jiva Gosvāmi's understanding is clearly different here.

Brahma's answer to this can be understood from the same epi- thets already used to address Kṛṣṇa, namely Adhiśa, i.e., Supreme Controller. Isa means the inspirer. "He is Nārāyaṇa, because all actions (ayana) of the living beings proceed from Him. But since Your controlling potency is superior to His, You are the Supreme Controller, adhiśa, and thus You are also called Nārāyaṇa, in the same way that governors and the emperor who rules over them are both called 'king."" It will be shown in an extensive discus- sion in Kṛṣṇa Sandarbha that Śrī Kṛṣṇa is directly the original Supreme Lord, superior even to Nārāyaṇa.

Commentaryolas 
Taken aback to hear Brahma address Him as "Mother" and "Father," Kṛṣṇa counters that He is just a young boy, the son of Nanda Maha- rāja, and asks how He could be the father of anyone, especially Brahmā. He tells Brahma that his claim would be true if He were Nārāyaṇa, but since that cannot be so, He asks, "Why are you trying to impose this on Me?" 
БТВИ ТО 
Brahma then speaks the next verse in the series (SB 10.14.14), in which he attributes the characteristics of Nārāyaṇa to Kṛṣṇa. He asserts that Kṛṣṇa is certainly Nārāyaṇa, and not that Nārāyaṇa is Kṛṣṇa. Here the indeclinable, hi, is used to establish certainty. Amara-koşa dictionary says that hi is used to indicate certainty or cause (hi hetāv avadhārane, Amara-koşa 3.3.257). In this verse Brahma uses various definitions of the name Nārāyaṇa and proves that they are all applicable to Śrī Kṛṣṇa. He uses the logic of the emperor and the ruler of a province, who are both called king. Sim- ilarly, because the Nārāyaṇa form is an expansion of Krsna, Krsna may also be called Nārāyaṇa, as He has all Nārāyaṇa's characteris- tics, and, in fact, includes Nārāyaṇa. Brahmā had just had a direct personal experience of this, so naturally he was keen to express it in his prayers.

In chapter 3 of the First Canto, Sūta Gosvāmī supplies a list of twenty-two avataras, but declares that in fact Bhagavan's avatāras are unlimited, like the rivulets flowing from an inexhaustible lake. Then he explains that all these avatāras are either plenary por- tions or portions of plenary portions of the Purusa (Garbhodakaśāyi Visņu), but that the original form of the Supreme Lord, Bhagavan, is Śrī Kṛṣṇa-kṛṣṇas tu bhagavan svayam. Brahma's prayers here confirm this statement, as does Brahma-samhita: 
spy

I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, who though He partially man- ifests within these worlds as different avataras, assuming forms like that of Rama, He also appeared in His own full-fledged form as Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Person. (Brahma-samhita 5.39)13

31032 Bhagavan's Form Is Unlimited 
This subject will be discussed in much greater detail in Śrī Kṛṣṇa Sandarbha. 
Another important point to be noted here is that Śrī Kṛṣṇa Him- self is not the direct witness of the living entities' actions. He is the Supreme Enjoyer and thus keeps Himself completely aloof from the material creation. He conducts the material affairs through His Nārāyaṇa expansions. Therefore, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī says that Nārāyaṇa is the direct witness (lokam sākṣāt paśyati), but that Kṛṣṇa knows everything through Nārāyaṇa (tenāṁśenaiva tad-draṣṭā na tu sākṣāt). This is confirmed in GITA 9.5, where He says to Arjuna, “And yet everything that is created does not rest in Me. Behold my yogic opulence!"14 
Nārāyaṇa, who is the source of the cosmos, of Śrī Brahmā, and of various avatāras, is but a portion of Kṛṣṇa. Anga means a bodily limb; so just as a limb is a part of the whole body, Nārāyaṇa is a part of Kṛṣṇa. What exists in one part of the body can be said to exist in the whole, so Brahma concludes that whatever exists in Nārāyaṇa also exists in Kṛṣṇa. And yet Kṛṣṇa was standing in front of Brahma in one little part of Vṛndāvana. This is the inconceivable potency of the Lord, without accepting which it is impossible to understand Him. veniriw sw parsinis goinistuos boda su ral

And if that form was material, then why was I not able to see it again instantly after my trance ended? Therefore, my conclusion is that Your Nārāyaṇa form is neither illusory nor limited by space." 
Commentary 
089 TO 290 
IN THE PREVIOUS SECTION, Śrī Brahma's prayers established that Śrī Kṛṣṇa, though appearing in the form of a small boy, is all-pervading and the source of everything, including Nārāyaṇa. In the next verse, he recalled his own experience of how the Lord's body is all-pervading, though it appears limited. 
In the beginning of creation, Brahma was born out of the lotus flower that sprouted from the navel of Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu. Brahma could see nothing but the lotus from which he had taken birth. He entered the lotus stem in search of its source, but could not find the root. Unsuccessful, he returned to the whorl of the flower and heard the divine command to perform austerities. Very obediently he followed the order, which pleased the Lord, who thus appeared to him (as described in Section 10). Brahma then offered prayers to Bhagavan and received His blessings, but the Lord disappeared again soon afterward. Recollecting this experi- ence, Śrī Brahma prays to Śrī Kṛṣṇa whom he recognizes as that same Supreme Person. 
From this, Brahma concluded that the Lord's form is not like that of an ordinary person who is limited to a particular place. Had the 
313 
aismelisho Śri Bhagavat Sandarbha sp 
Lord existed solely on the water, Brahma would have found Him when looking for Him, but He was unable to, though he searched for many years. This shows that Bhagavan's form cannot be achieved by one's own endeavor; it is only by Bhagavan's mercy that one can see His form. 
This same principle is also explained in Mahabharata by Bhiṣma to King Yudhisthira, while relating the history of King Uparicara, who performed a sacrifice for the pleasure of the Lord. Bhagavān appeared at the sacrifice in order to accept the oblations, but only the king could see Him. Bṛhaspati, who was the chief priest, became enraged at this and threw the sacrificial ladle into the air in frustra- tion. He shouted, "Why can't I see Him?" The assembled devotees then tried to pacify Bṛhaspati with the following words: 
O Bṛhaspati, neither you nor we can see the Lord at our will. Only those He favors can see Him. (MB 12.336.20)2 
If the Lord is not visible to our mundane vision, it does not mean that He does not exist. Furthermore, when one is able to see Him by His grace, it does not mean that He is limited, as He appears to be. Thus, Śri Brahmä implies that Bhagavan's form is transcendental. This is the significance of Brahma's having seen the Lord in perfect trance. If Bhagavan's body were material, Brahma would have seen it during his search; seeing Him in perfect trance means that He is beyond the material gunas. Patanjali's Yoga-sutra states:

In the perfect stage of trance, called dharma-megha-samādhi, the yogi is free from the gunas and their transformations. (Yoga-sūtra 4.32)3

In the verse under discussion, saj-jagad-vapuh means that the form of the Lord that Brahma saw both contained universes and yet was within the universe. This should not be considered magical or an illusion, because Bhagavan in this very form blessed Brahma and instructed him in the work of creation. But the Supreme Lord is com- pletely free from the five types of ignorance — avidyā, asmitā, rāga,

dveşa and abhiniveśa; thus, Brahmaji says, "I clearly saw it" (sudṛṣṭa), meaning that he was not in illusion or a dream state. 
In Vaiṣṇava-tosani, Śrīla Sanatana Gosvāmi comments on the words sudṛṣṭa and vyadarsi. He explains that after the Lord disap- peared from Brahma's vision, Brahma felt intense separation from Him. He again engaged in penances, but failed to regain the vision of Him. Later, however, the Lord did appear again by His sweet will. Next, Brahma gives further reasons to substantiate that Bhaga- vän's form is all-pervading.

THE PREVIOUS EXPLANATION is based on the narrations found in the Third Canto. The phrase tac căpi satyam' from SB 10.14.14 also means that the Lord's expansion of Nārāyaṇa is real, and not illu- sory like the cosmic form. Tac cej jala-stham in SB 10.14.15 indi- cates that if this real form of Bhagavan, situated on the waters of dissolution, was itself the universe, then it too would be part of material nature, which it is not. 
तस्मादेवं नारायणाङ्गकस्य भगवद्विग्रहस्य विश्वोऽपि प्रपञ्चोऽन्तर्भूत इति स्वयं भगवता दर्शितम् । श्रीमत्या जनन्यैवानुभूतमित्याह (भा० १० । १४ ।१६) - 
In this way, the body of the Lord, which includes Nārāyaṇa as its part, contains even the universe, which is within material nature. Śrī Kṛṣṇa showed this form that was also experienced by His mother. Brahmā next recalls that event: 
अत्रैव मायाधमनावतारे ह्यस्य प्रपञ्चस्य बहिःस्फुटस्य । कृत्स्रस्य चान्तर्जठरे जनन्या मायात्वमेव प्रकटीकृतं ते ॥ १४६ ॥

cor Here too, in this avatara that subdues māyā, You showed that the fir entire externally-manifested material cosmos is the creation of Homāyā, when You revealed it to Your mother as being within Your wown belly. (SB 10.14.16)2

[Brahma's intent is:] "In this avatara called Kṛṣṇa, which subdues māyā, You showed Your mother that the material world is both within Your belly and external to it, and thus any limitations it might impose on You are illusory. Māyā generates the illusion that you are within the universe, and that the universe is outside You. Actually, by Your inconceivable internal power, though You have a medium-sized body, You pervade everything."

My Lord, even though You are not affected by ignorance, which sid has five characteristics, You demonstrate the humanlike pleasure of 
sleeping on the comfortable cushioned bed of the snake in the waters of devastation, where there are violent waves. At that time, all the 220 universal planets are held within Your belly. (SB 3.9.20) Evalu 
Arjuna had a similar experience when he saw the viśva-rupa. Śrī Bhagavan said:

Śri Bhagavat Sandarbha d 
O Guḍākeśa, behold today the entire cosmos here at once in My body, with all the moving and unmoving forms of life and whatever else you may wish to see. (GITA 11.7)5 of 1 balvas to dw.com 
This means that the Lord's form is not limited either by time or 
space. 
Earlier, Brahma cited his own experience to establish that the Lord's form is all-pervading and transcendental. Now he offers more evidence by referring to the experience of Krsna's mother, Yasoda. 
He specifically states that Bhagavan's appearance in this avatara is māyā-dhamana, to subdue māyā. The material world is a manifes- tation of māyā, but the Lord's form is not. The phrases tac căpi satyam and tac cej jalastham, which appeared in the earlier verses, refer to Kṛṣṇa's Nārāyaṇa form, indicating there is no possibility that the Lord's form is a product of māyā. 
His personal form should not be compared to His cosmic form (virāḍ-rupa), which is material. The Second Canto describes the cos- mic form of the Lord and compares the various planetary systems to His bodily limbs, beginning with Pātāla, which is compared to the soles of His feet. The Lord's form is explained in this way for the ben- efit of neophyte yogis, so that they can purify their minds by such meditation. As Śrī Suka recommends: 
Having mastered postural alignment and breath, remaining aloof from the company of others, and regulating the senses, one should use the intelligence to fix the mind on the Lord's gross form, which is called the viraḍ-rupa. (SB 2.1.23)205 elde 
wob to 
Sukadeva Gosvāmi clearly describes the viraḍ-rupa as the gross form of Bhagavan. The cosmic form is called the first avatara because it came into being before any of the Lord's lilāvatāras. Maitreya Muni 
5 ihaika-stham jagat kṛtsnam paśyadya sa-caracaram 
mama dehe guḍākeśa yac canyad draṣṭum icchasi 
"Māyā-dhamana can be read either as a vocative (O Subduer of maya!) or as a part 
of a compound with avatara (avatara that subdues māyā). Jiva treats it here as a compound and below as a vocative. So here the referent should be the avatāra. "jitäsano jita-śvāso jita-sango jitendriyaḥ 
sthule bhagavato rupe manaḥ sandhārayed dhiyama Devapraday

34 Bhagavan Is Both within and without the Universe 
confirmed this when he said, "The gigantic form, virat-purusa, is the first manifestation of the Lord, and all material elements exist in Him" (SB 3.6.8). The form Śrī Brahma saw at the dawn of creation as well as the Lord's form in Vṛndāvana existed before the viraḍ-rupa and are therefore distinct from it. That the viraḍ-rupa is the first avatara implies that prior to that, the Lord existed in His original form, because avatāra means descent. 
Bewona Vhe According to Sridhara Svāmi, the cosmic virat form is an upadhi, or a kind of substitute for bhagavän: 
linam 
è 
855 iw bym to 2bVirat, hiranyagarbha and karana are the three limiting adjuncts b(upadhis) of God in His capacity as the Supreme Immanent, but 
SH 
He who is free from these is called Turiya, the fourth dimen- sion, or in other words, the Supreme Transcendence. (Bhāvārtha- 
anscendence. dipikā 11.15.16)10 
Although Śrī Nārāyaṇa lies down on the water, and Śrī Kṛṣṇa exists within the universe, They are not supported by these, because, as already shown in Section 31, näntar na bahir yasya (SB 10.9.13), there is no distinction of internal or external in the Lord's body. 
Brahma confirms his realization by referring to the experience of Mother Yasoda. One day, while she was breastfeeding baby Kṛṣṇa, the Lord yawned and Mother Yasoda saw the whole universe within His mouth. She trembled in surprise. According to Brahma, the uni- verse Yasoda saw within Krsna is the same universe that exists out- side Kṛṣṇa's body, as a manifestation of the Lord's māyā. This māyā cannot control the Lord, and thus Brahma refers to Him as māyā- dhamana - the subduer of māyā. 
Here the word māyā does not mean illusion or magic; it refers to the energy of the Lord, which always adheres to His will. Maitreya 
adyo'vatāro yatrasau bhūta-grāmo vibhāvyate 
The word upadhi means some form of limiting condition, but can also be taken to mean anything along the lines of substitution, deception, disguise, etc. 
Monier-Williams has, "anything which may be taken for or has the mere name or appearance of another thing" (A Sanskrit English Dictionary, p. 213). virad hiranyagarbhaś ca karanam cety upadhayaḥarter isasya yat tribhir hinam turiyam tat padam vidhuḥ

Muni told Vidura that the Lord uses this energy to manifest the cosmos:mals/isisam lacbne brod odst 
O fortunate one, maya, containing both cause and effect, is the energy of the Lord, the Seer, by which He has created all this mate- rial manifestation. (SB 3.5.25)11 
Śrī Kṛṣṇa showed Yasoda the universe within Himself and showed Himself within the universe, in order to teach that His body is not pervaded or limited by the universe. Brahma realized this fact and thus said that the universe is a manifestation of māyā, whereas the Lord's body is not. This is a refutation of the theory that the Lord's form is a product of maya or vidya (i.e., sattva-guna). One should not misconstrue the universe as being on a par with Bhagavan's body, because it exists within Him, as stated clearly in SB 10.14.16, māyātvam eva, the universe is a product of māyā. Although He appears medium-sized, the Lord simultaneously contains the uni- verse within His body, by His inconceivable potency. He pervades the whole universe in the same medium-sized body, and yet the universe is not part of His internal energy.

This is understood as follows: The Lord showed that Vraja was inside Him, while He was standing inside Vraja. Seeing Vraja both inside as well as outside of Kṛṣṇa, Mother Yasoda asked her- self, “Is this a dream, or is it an illusory creation of the gods? Or is it my own intelligence that has been bewildered somehow" (SB 10.8.40)?± In this way, the Lord made Yaśoda recognize that out of her many speculations, as to whether her vision was the result of dreams, illusion or reflection, none were valid. She then came to the only conclusion left to her, "It is a manifestation of my own son's natural yogic power of the self." So, Svayam Bhagavan revealed to His mother the simultaneous twofold nature of His own being, showing her that, through His inconceivable internal potency, He is endowed with a specific medium-sized [and appar- ently limited] body, while simultaneously being all-pervading.

IN THE PREVIOUS VERSE, Brahma said that the universe Yasoda saw in Kṛṣṇa's mouth and the one seen outside are both manifestations of māyā. A doubt may be raised: Why not consider that the uni- verse seen outside is a product of maya, and that the one inside is just its reflection, so that Kṛṣṇa is nothing more than the reflecting medium? Or, why not consider that both these universes are tran- scendental, and there would be thus no need to accept māyā? To dispel both these doubts, Brahma continues the next verse. He says bhāti yatha tatha - it exists outside exactly as it exists inside. There is no difference between the two. If the universe seen inside Kṛṣṇa was a reflection, it could not be the same as the external universe for the following reasons: 
1. A reflection is a mirror image, appearing in reverse. 
2. The reflection of a three-dimensional object is two-dimensional. 3. Only visible objects can have a reflected image. Thus, anything Thus that lacks form, such as scent, taste, touch and sound, would be pro absent in the reflection.

ad to swoy algey therudm 2002 yio do Moreover, an image never contains its own reflecting medium. When gazing at one's reflected image in a mirror, the mirror itself doesn't appear as part of the image. In the verse, however, Brahma says, sa-atman (along with Yourself), which means that the Lord could be seen within the universe that is inside Him. This is most amazing. It is like a pot inside a room that contains the room within itself, while the pot is again contained in that second room, and 
so on.

To further prove his point, Brahma recounts Mother Yasoda's experience of looking into Kṛṣṇa's mouth to see if He had eaten dirt. In that pastime Balarama and the other boys informed Yasoda that Kṛṣṇa had been eating mud. Mother Yasoda was worried that He may fall sick, so she caught Him by the hand and sternly asked, "O naughty boy, why have You been eating clay? If You are hungry, why don't You come home and eat? I will feed You." 
urganoorte 
323 
Śrī Bhagavat Sandarbha Urod 
ar Kṛṣṇa, trembling in fear, thought that if He admitted to the mis- deed, Yasoda would surely spank Him. He therefore denied it vocif- erously, explaining that His friends were jealous because He always defeated them at their games, and so they had devised this plan to get Him in trouble. Not only that, He complained too that even Balarama had joined them today in their plot to have Him punished. 
Kṛṣṇa further pleaded, "Why do you listen to them, Mother? I am right here. You can look in my mouth and see for yourself." He then opened His mouth, and as Yasoda looked inside, she saw the whole universe with all its planets and luminaries. She even saw herself holding Kṛṣṇa's hand and looking into His mouth. It was as if Kṛṣṇa were saying, "If I have eaten mud, it means the whole universe has eaten it, and thus you should chastise everyone." Or, "Eating means to take an externally-situated piece of food and to ingest it, but if the whole universe is already within My mouth, then how can you ask Me whether I have picked up a minute portion of that same universe to put in My mouth?" 
mu 
Mother Yasoda was baffled by this and deliberated as follows: 
Is this a dream, or an illusion created by the gods? Or is it my own intelligence that has been bewildered somehow? It seems, rather, that this is a manifestation of my son's inherent yogic power of the self. (SB 10.8.40)3

Yasoda wondered, "Is this a dream?" She then looked around and saw everything was normal, and concluded that she was not dream- being. She then asked herself, "Is this mayă created by the gods, i.e., by

wondered if she had seen a reflection of the universe in the mouth of her son, owing to her own bewildered intelligence. If she had, then how was it that she saw Krsna there as well? In a reflection, the mir- ror itself is not seen. Moreover, the worlds within and without His Hmouth appeared to be exactly the same, whereas an object and its "reflection in a mirror ordinarily appear in reverse. Therefore, she

finally concluded, "Oh, even though He is my son, it must be some inherent yogic power of His."4 
Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī himself comments that the Lord revealed to Yasoda that her final deliberation was the right one. This display is possible by the Lord's inconceivable energy. In Brahma's descrip- tion of Krsna's pastimes to Nārada Muni (SB 2.7.30), he used the term pratibodhitāsīta, meaning that Yasoda was illuminated with the intu- ition of Śrī Kṛṣṇa's yogic opulence. Śrī Sukadeva confirms this: 
When the cowherdess had realized the truth in this way, the Sup- reme Lord and Controller spread His internal maya potency in the form of maternal affection for Him. (SB 10.8.43)5 
In this way, Śrī Brahma proved that Kṛṣṇa's body is all-pervading, and that he is within Krsna's belly like a child within the womb of his mother, and thus he prays for the Lord's pardon. vd batimil guled 
In Section 32.4, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi quoted a mantra from Mahā- nārāyaṇa Upanisad, stating that Nārāyaṇa is all-pervading (MNU 9.5). Thus, Brahma has established that Kṛṣṇa is Nārāyaṇa, and, as was proposed in SB 10.14.14, Krsna is his father. 
In the next verse, Brahma continues to relate his own experience about Śrī Kṛṣṇa's body.

This means that this form is advaya- brahma, or the nondual Absolute Reality." Brabine driw bebeb saw you 90012 au

And since this form has the characteristics of Brahman, it is thus all-pervasive. 
Commentary 
AFTER EXPLAINING that this universe is a manifestation of māyā, and that it does not limit the Lord, Brahma recalls the incident he had just experienced a few minutes before, which inspired all these reflections. After Brahma stole the cows, calves and cowherd boys, 
327 
Śri Bhagavat Sandarbha 
Kṛṣṇa was alone (eko'si). He then expanded Himself into as many cowherd boys and calves as Brahmā had stolen. In fact, His expan- sions included their respective dresses, sticks, turbans, ornaments and even their lunch boxes. When Brahma returned a year later, he expected to see Kṛṣṇa dejected and miserable without all His com- panions. Instead, he was surprised to witness exactly the same scene he had been watching before - Kṛṣṇa with His cowherd boyfriends woy to shiatuo vino grazing their calves. 
Brahma carefully observed both sets of boys and calves - those he had hidden in the cave and those playing with Kṛṣṇa- and could find no difference between them. In fact, he could not even deter- mine which was the original set. Then to his utter bewilderment, he saw all the boys and calves turn into four-handed Vişņu forms: 
BThen, while Śrī Brahma looked on, all the calves and the boys tend- ing them were suddenly observed to have complexions the color of dense, dark rain clouds and to be wearing yellow silken garments. Each had four arms, holding a conch-shell, disc, mace and lotus, qreach adorned with diadems, earrings, pearl necklaces and sylvan no wreaths. On the upper portion of the right side of their chests was the emblem of the Goddess of Fortune, and about their wrists, pairs of bracelets made of precious stones. They were decked with anklets hand bangles made of conch-shell, girdles and rings, and covered 
from head to foot with fresh soft garlands of tulasi leaves, offered by those of abundant merit. (SB 10.13.46-49)2

Brahma also saw these visņu-murtis being worshiped by many Brahmas, by the 24 material elements personified, by the yogic per- fections, Time, and so on. The scene became so intense that Brahma had to close his eyes. The Lord then dismissed His yoga-māyā and Brahma again viewed everything as normal. He saw Kṛṣṇa in Vraja

holding yogurt and rice in His hand, searching for the calves and cowherd boys, just as he had been doing a year before. At that moment, Brahma jumped down from his swan carrier and fell at Krsna's lotus feet, only to stand up and fall at his feet again. He con- tinued this performance repeatedly, his eyes flowing with an inun- dation of ecstatic love. He now recalled this incident as he tried to verbalize his realizations about Bhagavan's form and His potencies. 
The words tvad ṛte (other than You) are important here, as they signify that everything except for Bhagavan is māyā. The pronoun You (tvat), however, in the phrase, "other than You," includes all the cows, the cowherd boys, and Vraja, which are part of His internal energy and thus an extension of the One Entity that stands beyond māyā. This was Brahma's experience. 
Another significant phrase is sākam maya (including myself). When Brahma saw the visņu-murtis being worshiped, he saw him- self included among the worshipers. This meant that the brahmāṇḍa in which Brahma exists is also within the Lord, implying that every- thing is pervaded by Śrī Kṛṣṇa's body and that nothing exists outside of Him. Therefore, those who consider this creation to be outside of the Lord are in illusion. This was a highly profound experience for Brahmā. 
Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī opened Bhagavat Sandarbha with the cele- brated vadanti tat tattva-vidaḥ verse, one of the key verses of the entire Srimad Bhāgavatam, which defines the Absolute Truth as advaya-jñāna (nondual being-awareness). Jīva Gosvāmi's entire analysis of the Absolute Truth proceeds from this vital perspective. In Anuccheda 6, he said that he would discuss this verse through to the end of the third Sandarbha (Paramatma Sandarbha). These prayers of Śri Brahma are an integral part of this commentary, since the verse under discussion also states that Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the nondual Absolute, advaya-brahma, hein belmilaired godt box ammol 
The Brahman described in Upanisad verses, such as ekam evād- vitiyam brahma (CHU 6.2.1) and satyam jñānam anantam brahma (TU 2.1.1), is identified in Bhagavatam as Kṛṣṇa. There is no Brah- man other than Him. There is no entity equal to Him, nor can any entity exist without Him. Therefore, He is advaya, or nondual. He 
329 
andeŚrī Bhagavat Sandarbha 
can become many and remain one at the same time; thus, He is advaya-brahma. Brahma is the highest authority on the Vedas and Vedanta, and thus he is called veda-garbha, the womb of the Vedas, or one who contains the Vedic knowledge within his being. He per- sonally witnessed all the attributes of Brahman in the body of Krsna. While relating Brahma's experience of Krsna as Brahman, Sukadeva Gosvāmi says that the vişnu-murtis: unde 
[...] were embodiments of the one absolute essence, consisting of being, awareness, and infinite bliss alone. Their infinite glory was untouched even by those who see with vision refined by study of the Upanisads. Thus, for a moment, the unborn Brahma beheld all these bricaspects of the Supreme Brahman and self of all, by whose effulgence

Marveling at the great fortune of the residents of Vraja, Brahmā exclaimed near the end of these prayers: aladders dad of 
How fortunate! How fortunate are the residents of Nanda's cowherd community, for their friend is the supreme bliss, the eternal, and the 10 complete Brahman. (SB 10.14.32)46 zoals me bars Bride78 
Because Kṛṣṇa is Brahman, and Brahman is all-pervading, Kṛṣṇa pervades everything in His personal form. This is con- firmed by Vedanta-sutra, "The form of the Lord, although separated by space, does not undergo change, because He simultaneously exists everywhere" (na sthānato'pi parasyobhaya-lingam sarvatra hi, vs 3.2.11).

This pastime of Kṛṣṇa also proves that He is the source and cause of everything, spiritual as well as material. He demonstrated this by expanding sequentially into the cowherd boys and calves, Nārāyaṇa forms, and then the unlimited universes. Thus, it is no exaggeration

1 
अजानतां त्वत्पदवीमनात्मन्यात्मात्मना भासि वितत्य मायाम् । सृष्टाविवाहं जगतो विधान इव त्वमेषोऽन्त इव त्रिनेत्रः ॥ १४९ ॥ 
You are the Supreme Self. To those unaware of Your true position, You Yourself expand Your māyā and appear within the non-self [i.e., within inert matter]: as me [ Brahmā], for the creation of the universe; as this [Visnu], for its maintenance; and as three-eyed Śiva, to bring about its end. (SB 10.14.19)1

The pronoun "You" should be read as the subject of the verb bhäsi 
(appear), since to understand a sentence, one should first identify

332 
37 Śrī Kṛṣṇa Is the Ultimate Cause 
the subject and its related verb. On the strength of the verb [which is conjugated in the second person], the subject has to be "You." Therefore, the word iva (as), is not related to "You," but to the pronoun esa ("this," i.e., Visņu). As such, the pronoun "You" refers to Śrī Kṛṣṇa's personal form, since He is directly the original Supreme Lord, and not to one of the avatāras presiding over the gunas of nature, nor would any other understanding be in conformity to the assertions made in the previous verse (SB 10.14.18). 
तस्मादयमर्थः – त्वत्पदवीं तव तथाभूतं स्वरूपमजानतामजानतः प्रति । आत्मा तत्तदंशि- स्वरूपस्त्वमेव । आत्मना तत्तदंशेन । मायां सृष्ट्यादिनिमित्तशक्तिम् । अनात्मनि जडरूपे महदाद्युपादाने प्रधाने । वितत्य प्रवर्त्य तत्तत्कार्यभेदेन भिन्न इव भासीत्यर्थः ।

Therefore, the meaning is this: To "those unaware" (ajānatām) of "Your true position," (tvat-padavi, i.e., Kṛṣṇa's ontological iden- tity) as we have been describing it [You appear differently accord- ing to different functions]. The word ātmā here means the origi- nal complete form of God, who is the source (amsi) of all partial manifestations. You alone are that Supreme Self. You Yourself (ātmanā) means through Your different partial manifestations. Māyā means the energy that is employed for the creation, main- tenance and dissolution of the universe. "Within the non-self" (anātmani) means within inert pradhana, which acts as material cause in the form of mahat and so on. The word vitatya (expand) means "set into motion," i.e., according to these different func- tions [of creation, maintenance and dissolution], You appear differently. 
कथम् ? जगतः सृष्टावहं ब्रह्मेव विधाने पालने एष इव एतत्कार्यपरिच्छिन्न इव पालनमात्र- कार्य इवेत्यर्थः । अन्ते त्रिनेत्र इवेति । वस्तुतस्त्वमेव तत्तद्रूपेण वर्तसे मूढास्तु त्वत्तस्तान् पृथक् पश्यन्तीति भावः । यतो द्वितीये ब्रह्मवाक्यम् (भा० २।६।३१) - 
How do You appear?

Actually, it is you who exist in all these three forms, but ignorant people

see them as different from You. Thus, it was stated by Brahma in the Second Canto: [more broos

अतो भगवत्स्वरूपैकत्वेन न ब्रह्मादिवद् विष्णुरिवेति निर्दिष्टम् । 
Because Śrī Viṣṇu is an expansion of, and nondifferent from, the Supreme Lord Kṛṣṇa, Brahma did not mention Him by name, say- ing "as Visnu," as he had done in his own case and in the case of Śiva." Instead, he simply said, "as this." 
Commentary 
IN SB 10.14.18, Brahma established that Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the nondual Abso- lute Truth, the cause of all causes (advaya-brahma). Hearing this, Krsna raises an objection. He says that the work of creation, main- tenance and dissolution is performed by Brahma, Viṣṇu and Śiva, respectively, and during Brahma's day various avataras appear. So why is Brahma saying that He alone is the cause of everything? 
The answer is found in this verse, where Brahma says that only ignorant people do not know that the Lord appears in various forms to conduct the functions of creation, maintenance and dissolution. Amara-koşa dictionary states that the word padavi (position) also means "a path" (Amara-kosa 2.1.15). Therefore, tvat-padavi (your path) means the path of devotion, for the Lord says He can be known only by bhakti:

Non-devotees cannot understand how the Lord exists every- where and in everything. His energy, called māyā, gives rise to duality, and therefore, ignorant people cannot see that He is the ultimate cause behind everything. The Śruti says that only the Lord exists - sarvam nārāyaṇa eva bhavati, "All this is Nārāyaṇa" (Nārāyaṇa-uttara-tapani Upanisad 3.1). This means that one who does not recognize everything to be Bhagavan's energy will have an independent ego and desires for enjoyment, and will thus become bound by the gunas of nature. Brahma thus concludes that every- thing is the Lord's energy, and that He is the cause of everything. Anything that appears independent of Him is due to the influence of māyā. 
In Śrī Brahma's verse, Śrī Jiva seeks to explain why in the second half of the verse, where the three guṇāvatāras are named, the sub- ject "You" should not be taken to mean the preserver, Visṣṇu. Indeed, the word iva, meaning "as," immediately precedes tvam (You), so why should it not be translated as, "appearing as You, in order to maintain the universe?" This is indeed the way that Sridhara Svāmi explains the verse. 
But Śrī Jiva says that the subject "You" has to be read with the verb bhāsi, with which it agrees. As a result, even though the two words are far apart in the verse, the word iva should be read with the word eșa (this one), referring to the Visnu form that has been mentioned several times in these verses. This Visnu is clearly dis- tinct from Svayam Bhagavan Śrī Kṛṣṇa, to whom Brahmā is speak- ing. If iva was in connection with "You," that would convey the inap- propriate idea that Kṛṣṇa personally maintains the universe. At the same time, because Visnu is nondifferent from Kṛṣṇa, it was not nec- essary to mention His name in the verse. The demonstrative pro- noun eşa (this) refers to an object or person that is in proximity to 
bhaktyāham ekaya grahyaḥ śraddhayātmā priyaḥ satām bhaktiḥ punāti man-niṣṭhā śvapäkän api sambhavät 
335 
Śri Bhagavat Sandarbha 
the speaker. By using it, Brahma distinguishes Visnu from himself and Rudra. Although Visnu is counted among the gunavatāras, He is not an empowered living entity. Therefore, the Bhāgavatam verse (SB 2.6.31) quoted at the end of this section uses the adjective tri-sakti- dhrk (the possessor of all three types of energies) for Visņu alone. Purușa-rupena in this verse means Krsna's expansion as Visnu. 
In this verse, Brahma has spoken about the guṇāvatāras as being manifestations of Kṛṣṇa. He next explains the position of the various lilāvatāras.

Commentary 
IN THE PREVIOUS VERSE, SB 10.14.19, Śrī Brahma said that ignorant people do not understand that Kṛṣṇa is the supreme cause of every- thing. An obvious question arises, "How can the Lord, who is beyond sense perception, be known?" So, Brahma speaks the next verse, which explains that just as the Lord appears as the gunāvataras, He appears as other avataras to dispel atheistic teachings and establish religious principles. He appears in different species of life according to necessity and kills the asuras who propagate atheism. 
How can Bhagavan take birth, since He is ajana, or birthless? Brahma replies, "You are Prabhu," meaning that the Lord has incon- ceivable power and can accomplish what is ordinarily impossible. It has already been shown, however, that the Lord is all-pervading, so 
338 
38 Various Avatāras of Bhagavan 
where is the question of His birth? Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī answers that His "birth" means, rather, "making Himself visible;" the word used is pradurbhāva, which means self-manifestation. Kṛṣṇa is not bound by material laws, prior to, or after, His "birth," nor is He forced to take "birth." He is addressed in this verse as vidhāta, which means that He makes the rules, but is not subject to them.abdum 
Kṛṣṇa raised further doubts: "Brahma, you say that My forms are eternal and full of bliss, so why are they not always visible? Fur- thermore, how can all these forms exist simultaneously in one form? Material objects come into existence and vanish, so how can you compare My transcendental body to them?" 
In this anuccheda, Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī explains that it is very dif- ficult to understand the Lord's form, including its all-pervasive fea- ture. The pastimes that He performs through His form are a mani- festation of His yoga-maya and supersede logic and experience. Bha- gavan is independent (svarat) and potent; therefore, He is free to engage His energy, and His activities are unpredictable. Sometimes His pastimes seem to conform to the laws of material nature as if gov- erned by them, and at other times they display their quality of being beyond the influence of material nature. In both cases they are tran- scendental. Although He appears in various forms, such as a fish or boar, He is not limited by them. He is naturally endowed with form, and yet His form is all-pervading. He showed Śrī Brahma that all forms are contained within His form, and that ultimately this is just a fraction of His opulence.f 
In his Bṛhat-krama-sandarbha, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi writes that Bhagavan appears as Yajña among the devas, Nara-Nārāyaṇa among the sages, King Pṛthu among humans, Varaha among animals and Matsya and Kurma among aquatics.

[Brahma is saying:] "Who in the three worlds knows where, or how, or to what extent, or when, You expand, or put into action, Your inconceivable internal potency, yoga-māyā, in all these ways and enjoy Your activities (ūti), or pastimes, within these three worlds?" The question is rhetorical - no one knows. The same idea is conveyed in KU 2.3, "One who claims not to know Brahman, knows; but one who claims to know Brahman, does not know."3 
अत्र दुर्ज्ञेयतापुरस्कृतेनैव सम्बोधनचतुष्टयेन चतुर्षु युक्तिमाह – हे भूमन् । क्रोडीकृतानन्त- मूर्त्यात्मकश्रीमूर्ते । अयं भावः – एकमपि मुख्यं भगवद्रूपं युगपदनन्तरूपात्मकं भवति । 
In view of the difficulty in comprehending Kṛṣṇa's divine pas- times, Brahma here addresses the Lord with four different epi- thets, each embodying a solution to one of the four questions posed. The term he bhuman ["O Bhuman!" lit., "abundant," "great," or "the Earth," i.e., the aggregate of all existing things], here means, "O You, who include unlimited forms in Your own divine form!" The sense is that the one primary form of the Lord simultaneously contains unlimited forms within it. 
Commentary 
THE QUESTIONS POSED BY ŚRĪ KRSNA serve as an introduction to the verse and subsequent commentary. If His form, as Kṛṣṇa, is all- pervading, as established by Brahma, then where do other forms, like Rama, exist? Brahma said (Anuccheda 38) that the Lord is ajana, or birthless, which also means that all forms of the Lord are eternal. Moreover, if the forms are eternal, how is it that they are seen to take birth? Brahma witnessed Kṛṣṇa's opulence. If what he saw was the complete opulence of Bhagavan, no matter how great, then the Lord is limited. So why did Brahma state that He is unlimited? Fur- thermore, Kṛṣṇa expanded Himself into cowherd boys, calves and so on. Where do they exist now, while Brahma is seeing only Kṛṣṇa? Brahma responds with the verse given here SB 10.14.21.

the Kṛṣṇa asked, "Brahma, you say that I am supremely powerful and independent, so, why do I accept abominable forms, like a fish and boar?” Śrī Brahmā answered with this verse.

barrier mog adr AKRŪRA ALSO PRAYED WITH THE SAME VIEW, "Although You have various forms, You are situated in this one form" (SB 10.40.7). The Śruti also states, "Although He is one, He is seen as many." Hence, the devotee sees the Lord in accordance with his own disposi- tion, developed through the maturation of worship. Vedānta- sūtra states, "Because worshipers have differences in knowledge, their perception of the Lord differs accordingly" (vs 3.3.52)? Śrī Madhvācārya comments on this, "There is difference in how the Lord is viewed due to difference in worship."

different color depending on the angle from which it is viewed. Śrī Kṛṣṇa, who contains many other forms in His prime efful- gence, which are likened to the multiple colors in the cloth, is Himself likened to the complete cloth, and the other colors seen from different angles exemplify the other forms of Kṛṣṇa.

When did He do all this? While His parents watched. The sig- nificance of the phrase "in that very same body" is further eluci- dated with the words, "of divine movement" (divya-gatih). Divya (divine) means supremely inconceivable, such as stated in the Śruti, "All forms of the present and future are eternally present in His form” (yad gatam bhavac ca bhavisyac ca, BAU 3.9.3); “divine movement" thus means that He can manifest or unmanifest any one of the forms that eternally exist in Him.

also manifests various forms in the same body. Another possi- ble meaning for divya-gatir yatha naṭaḥ is "like a heavenly actor." Therefore, the Lord's portrayal of a particular form means com- plete acceptance of that particular form, for no one other than Bhagavan can be total in all respects when taking on a role.

This exam- ple is used to illustrate that the Lord is the sole cause behind the creation of the universe, and it is relevant in that sense, even though in the case of the spider, the saliva (i.e., the matter) that goes into the production of the web is generated by eating insects (i.e., from an external source).

Śrīdhara Svāmi comments: "Tribhuvanadhiśaḥ (the controllers of the three spheres) means Brahma, Viṣņu and Maheśa. The word māyāḥ signifies that to test Rantideva's fortitude, these three had first manifested illusory forms, such as that of an outcaste."

[Returning to the discussion of SB 3.24.31,] The cause of such forms being unsuitable is expressed in the word arūpinaḥ (form- less).

Returning now to the verse under discussion [SB 10.14.21], we shall continue with our explanation of the remaining three epithets in Śrī Brahma's prayer [Bhagavan, Parātmā and Yogeśvara], and how these epithets embody respectively the response to the three interrogatives - how, how many and when (katham, kati, kadā). The term he bhagavan (Hey Bhagavan!) means, "O Lord, posses- sor of inconceivable power." The sense is that the inconceivable appearance of the Lord's form and so on is not possible by any means other than His inconceivable internal potency. This is the answer to the question, "how" (katham vä)?

Next, the term he paratman (Hey Paratman!) means, "You who are the Self (ātmā), or the Source, of all other (para) avatāras," like the puruşăvatāras, each possessing unlimited power. Since they have unlimited opulence, it stands to reason that You do also. The import is that it is impossible for the mind or speech to ascer- tain the extent of the Lord's opulences as they manifest. This is the logic behind the question, "how many" (kati vä)?

Next, the term he yogeśvara (Hey Yogeśvara!) means, "You are the controller of the internal energy, called yoga-māyā, which is responsible for accommodating the various forms in the one orig- inal form," or, "You control through that energy." The import is this: Just as uncountable forms exist within Your original form, various plenary portions also exist in You. Whenever You desire to manifest a particular form, owing to the maturity of the devo- tee's worship, You manifest that particular form. This is the logic behind the question, "when" (kadā)?

BRAHMA SAYS that no one can understand Bhagavan's mind. In SB 10.14.21, he posed four rhetorical questions, and the answer to each is that no one can know the Lord. Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī com- ments that the four reasons why no one can know Bhagavan are con- cealed in the four ways He is questioned - kva vā kathaṁ vā kati vā kadeti. The four questions are: kva (where?), katham (how?), kati (how many? or how much?) and kada (when?). 
The four names Brahmā used to address the Lord are:

The first question is answered by the first address, and so on. No one can understand where (kva) the Lord will manifest a particular pastime because He is all-pervading (Bhuman) and can manifest any form anywhere. THE DE PESTE 
No one knows how (katham) the Lord will perform His līlā because He has all opulences (Bhagavan). He can lift Govardhana Hill on His little finger. To lift a hill one has to get underneath it and uproot it like a mushroom, while keeping it intact. Even if one could accomplish this, how would he be able to sustain it on a single point? No civil engineer could conceive of how to do it, because such a heavy weight cannot be concentrated on a single pillar, what to speak of the tip of the finger. Yet the Lord did this and the mountain did not collapse. 
No one knows how many (kati) actions the Lord can perform because He has unlimited qualities and performs unlimited acts simultaneously (Parātmā). Even Śrī Ananta cannot enumerate them with His thousand tongues. 
And no one knows when (kada) the Lord will perform a partic- ular act, because He is not limited by time (Yogeśvara). Kṛṣṇa told Arjuna that he could see whatever he wished within the viśva-rupa. He said that all the soldiers on the battlefield had already been killed by Him, and, indeed, Arjuna saw this. Nonetheless, Kṛṣṇa asked Arjuna to fight. The viśva-rupa which Arjuna saw was not magical but real. 
Śrī Brahma concludes by stating that it is most difficult to under- stand how and when Śrī Kṛṣṇa acts. Anyone who claims that he knows exactly how the Lord will function is grossly ignorant. One who understands that Bhagavan has unlimited, inconceivable 
35040 Unlimited Forms of Bhagavan Exist within One Form 
potencies never makes such vain claims, for he has understood the Absolute. This is the significance of the mantra cited from KENA 2.3. 
Śankarācārya, in commenting upon this mantra, writes, "A knower of the Absolute says that He does not know the Absolute. But one who asserts that he has understood the Absolute does not know." This does not mean that we should not try to understand the Lord, or that it is impossible to know Him at all. We should endeavor to know Him, but must accept that we can never know Him fully. A bird flies in the sky according to its capacity and need, but it can never fathom the length and breadth of the sky. The Lord can be understood to the extent that He reveals Himself to His devo- tees; thus, only a humble and surrendered soul can know Bhagavan. Those who are proud remain shackled by māyā: qlutussd gubicon shulani Foolish people, who are actually drowning in ignorance, but con- sider themselves intelligent and scholarly, get battered by the kicks of maya. They wander in this material world just like blind people being led by other blind people. (MUU 1.2.8) 10 
ce 
Quite often it is seen that foolish people out of haughtiness con- sider themselves omniscient. But those who actually know the Lord consider themselves insignificant. 
Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī now says that there are four intentions behind these four rhetorical questions and addresses. 
The word bhuman literally means "abundant," or "great." In the present context it refers to the Lord, who contains unlimited forms within His one form. Akrūra, Śrī Kṛṣṇa's uncle, also addressed Him as bahu-mūrty-eka-mürtika, or one whose singular form contains multiple forms. 
Akrura was ordered by Kamsa to bring Krsna and Balarama to Mathura to participate in the dhanur-yajña, which was really a plot to kill Kṛṣṇa. While Akrura was escorting Krsna and Balarama to Mathura by chariot, he stopped at the Yamuna to perform his noon- time ablutions and worship. After bathing, he dipped his head into the water to chant the gayatri-mantra and was surprised to see Kṛṣṇa

and Balarama in the water. He wondered how this was possible, as he had left Them on the chariot. Out of curiosity, he came out of the river and saw that Kṛṣṇa and Balarama were, indeed, still sitting on the chariot, just as he had left Them. He concluded that what he had seen in the water must have been an illusion and again peered within the waters of Yamuna Devi. This time he saw an even more amazing sight. Kṛṣṇa was relaxing on the body of the thousand- hooded Ananta while being eulogized by divine beings, like the Sid- dhas, Caranas, Gandharvas and even the asuras. He was also sur- rounded by associates like Nanda and Sunanda and being served by the various personified opulences. Seeing this, Akrūra's heart over- flowed with ecstasy and tears of joy gushed from his eyes. He began reciting beautiful prayers in praise of Śrī Kṛṣṇa. One of the verses includes the phrase bahu-mürty-eka-mūrtika: 
Others also, whose minds have been purified according to regula- tions established by You, become absorbed in You and worship You as the One Form containing a multiplicity of forms. (SB 10.40.7) 
Although the Lord has various forms, such as Vasudeva, Sankar- ṣaṇa, Pradyumna, Aniruddha, Matsya, Kurma and so on, He is but giani asylsamalt sbianco one. Gopala-tapani Upanisad states:

Akrūra also mentions that the Lord manifests various forms on this earth and gives a partial list of such forms. According to the desire of His devotees, Bhagavan manifests a corresponding form: 
I reveal Myself to all who surrender unto Me, exactly in accordance ot with the essential nature of their surrender. (GITA 4.11)13

Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī cites vs 3.3.52, "Because worshipers have dif- ferences in knowledge, their perception of the Lord differs accord- ingly," to substantiate this point. In Govinda-bhāṣya, Śrīla Baladeva Vidyabhūṣaṇa gives the following explanation of this sutra: 
Bu 
Prior to this, the question was raised, "Do all worshipers realized Brahman in the same way, or do they experience it differently?" Some people argue that the various grades of liberated devotees all realize Brahman in the same way. Although they may have followed different sädhanās (involving differing theory and praxis), their per- ception of Brahman will be uniform, just as different travelers enter- ing a town see the same city, though they approached it by different roads. Śruti confirms this uniformity. Mundaka Upanisad, for exam- ple, states (MUU 3.1.3) that upon gaining liberation, all living beings Feattain similarity (samya): "When a wise person beholds that golden- colored Original Person, the supreme actor and controller, who is the source of Brahman, he is enabled to shake off piety and sin. He then becomes free from material bondage and attains supreme sim- ilarity."14 
The conclusion of the purva-pakṣa (the contending viewpoint) is that bethe liberated state involves absolute uniformity in terms of how the Absolute is realized. In response to this, Śrīla Vyasa writes this sutra, "Because worshipers have differences in knowledge, their percep- tion of the Lord differs accordingly." This states that different devo-ad tees have different realizations according to their bhava ("the pre-d dominant disposition of awareness" or "the predominant flavor of 
Бо 
existential being"), and according to the corresponding practices Opthey undertake. 
14 
This is also supported by the Śruti (CHU 3.14.2): "Because human beings are creatures of faith, after death they each obtain a result o according to their faith and sentiments. So let them have full faith in the Lord." 15 
This is popularly called tat-kratu-nyaya, or the principle of faith. The similarity referred to in MUU 3.1.3 means that all see the same Lord,

Although different travelers entering a city from different paths see the same city, they see it from different angles of vision, and, therefore, they do not have the exact same picture of the town. Sim- ilarly, different devotees see the same Lord, but their realizations differ. To explain further, Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmi gives the example of a multi-colored cloth that reflects different colors when seen from dif- ferent angles. Another example is that of certain gems. Cat's-eye, for example, appears to have different colors when seen from various angles. This quality is known to gemologists as chatoyancy. A more modern example would be the hologram, which exhibits different images when viewed from different angles. 
This explains the purpose behind the question kva, where does the Lord manifest a particular form? Depending on the specific mood of devotion, He manifests a corresponding form to the devotee. 
To further explain how various forms exist in one form of Bha- gavān, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī recalls the Bhāgavatam's description of Vamana Deva's appearance. Aditi, the wife of Kasyapa, performed the payo-vrata ceremony for twelve days to please Śrī Viṣņu. At the end of the ceremony, the Lord appeared and agreed to bless her by becoming her son. In due course, Śrī Visņu appeared in His four- handed form and then, in front of Aditi and Kasyapa, transformed Himself into Vamana, the dwarf brahmacārī. The Lord is compared to an expert theatrical actor, who puts on various costumes and plays different roles. An actor's expertise lies in concealing his iden- tity and in perfectly imitating a particular character. As an actor is one person, but plays various roles and thus appears differently; so too Bhagavan is one, but appears in different forms. The actor is lim- ited, because he can only change his costume, not his body, but the Lord actually has different forms, yet He is one person. 
This analogy is inadequate because the Lord does not need to put on costumes to look different, but this is not a defect in the example since the purpose is to help us better grasp His position by alluding to some features common to both Him and an actor. Nyāya-sūtra says: 
354 
40 Unlimited Forms of Bhagavan Exist within One Form 
An example is that about which a common man and a man of highly refined discrimination share the same understanding (buddhi- samya). (Nyaya-sutra 1.1.25)16 
To show how certain examples can be used despite their limita- tions, Śrī Jiva cites the example of a spider, given in Śrimad Bhaga- vatam, to illustrate that Bhagavan is both the efficient and material cause of the cosmos. The spider weaves the web and thus is the effi- cient cause of the web. He is also the material cause because he uses his own saliva to manufacture thread for the web, and does not use any external ingredients. 
A spider, however, needs to eat insects to survive and to produce the saliva he uses to generate the web, whereas the Lord does not require anything external, either to produce something or to ensure His survival. The spider builds a web to trap insects for its suste- nance, but the Lord has no such purpose in creating the cosmos. So the example has some dissimilarities, but overall it serves its pur- pose. In the same way, the example of an actor, used to explain how multiple forms of Bhagavan are contained within Kṛṣṇa's singular all-encompassing form, is perfectly suitable. 
Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi then cites a verse spoken by Śrī Brahmā (SB 3.9.11)" to show that while Kṛṣṇa contains multiple forms within His one form, He reveals the particular form upon which the devo- tee incessantly meditated in the course of practice. Alternatively, Brahma's statement indicates that Kṛṣṇa has only one form, but appears differently to different devotees. This does not mean, how- ever, that one can meditate on any concocted form. This is the signif- icance of the words śrutekṣita-patha. Śruta means heard about the Lord, and specifically about His forms, from an authorized source, the Vedas. The significance of the word ikṣita (seen) is that one should see the form of the Lord through the ears. This will purify the heart and bestow qualification to see the Lord's form. As stated by Sūta Gosvāmī: 
16 yatra laukika-parikṣakānāṁ yasminn arthe buddhi-samyaḥ sa dṛṣṭāntaḥ 
17 This verse was previously quoted in Anuccheda 9.

nosni Śrī Bhagavat Sandarbha 
Hearing about Kṛṣṇa and glorifying Him is a most holy activity, for when one listens to such topics, the Lord, residing in the devo- tees' hearts, destroys whatever inauspiciousness remains there still. (SB 1.2.17) 18 
Shilmil zieds stiges! 
Kathā, or pastimes, are always related to form. Hearing makes the devotee qualified and attracts the Lord to take His seat on the pure lotus-like heart of His devotee. Bhagavan appears in what- ever form the devotees meditate upon (vibhavayanti). This verse (SB 3.9.11) should not be mistakenly understood to promote anthro- pomorphism, which means to attribute a human form, such as one's own, to the Lord. Neither does it promote zoomorphism, the attri- bution of animal forms to God. Because some forms of the Lord have animal shape, like Varāhāvatāra, while others, like Rāma and Kṛṣṇa, are humans, appearing Indian in their dress and behavior, some modern scholars propose the above two isms. In other words, they say that one projects certain qualities from one's own mind on God. Brahma's verse, however, directs one to meditate on particu- lar forms authorized by the Vedas, which, by their own admission, are without human origin (apauruşeya), and hence, the forms they depict cannot be the product of human projection.!9 
19 
But if Bhagavan is independent, why does He appear in such forms? The verse says sad-anugrahaya - to bless His devotees. The Lord is controlled by the love of His devotees. The word nätha ("mas- ter" or "husband") is important in this verse. The devotees control Him just as a chaste wife controls her husband:

Feuerbach (1804-1872), it is as ancient as Xenophanes (570-480 BC). The Advaita Vedantic position is that all external phenomena ultimately have their primary existence in the desires and saṁskāras of the individual. Something similar applies where the Divine Truth is concerned, but the forms manifested by the Lord are a result of the pure desire of the jiva in his constitutional position as an eternal servant of God. This desire is not the outcome of any material samskära but results from hearing Vedic literature. The hierarchy of forms of God reflect a hierarchy of purity of this identity, with Krsna as Svayam Bhagavan representing the purest forms of love relationship between the Supreme Truth and the individual self.

usdman s 
Kardama Muni says that only those forms that are pleasing to the devotees are suitable forms of the Lord. Other forms have no rel- evance, as the Lord is never alone. This means He manifests only those forms that are pleasing to His devotees. In fact, the relative importance of a particular avatara is determined by the greatness of His associates - parikara-vaiśistyäd ävirbhāva-vaisistyam. One of the super-excellent characteristics of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, which distinguishes Him from all other forms of God, is that He has unsurpassed loving relationships with His devotees, prema-mādhuri?1 
This implies that Bhagavan's form is not material, because no devotee aspires to worship a material form. Thus, He is called arūpiņa, meaning, He who has no material form. In commenting on SB 3.24.31, Śrīla Viśvanatha Cakravartīpāda makes this important point. He says that although neophytes on the spiritual path medi- tate on the universal form, virāḍ-rupa, it is not the Lord's own form, because it is material and not the ultimate goal of attainment -- not even for those who meditate upon it. This type of meditation is rec- ommended just for beginners to help purify the mind of material contamination. 
Some forms of Bhagavan are not His real forms, such as the ones shown to King Rantideva. Rantideva was exceedingly generous by nature and had given away all his worldly goods in charity, leaving him and his family utterly destitute. As a result, he and his family were without food or water for forty-eight days, leaving them all on the verge of starvation. 
By divine will, they received a gift of food on the forty-ninth day, but just as they sat down to eat, a brāhmaṇa guest arrived. Rantideva saw Śrī Hari in everyone; thus, he treated the guest as if he were a god. He fed him and then divided the remnants among his fam- ily members. But again, as they were about to eat, a śūdra guest

21 See BRS 2.1.43. 
357 
and sunid Śrī Bhagavat Sandarbha m 
suddenly appeared, asking for food, and Rantideva gave him some. A few moments later, yet another guest came, bringing with him a number of dogs. They were given all that remained. The little water that was left, Rantideva divided among his family members. Before they could drink it, however, an outcaste approached them begging for water. Seeing the outcaste suffering from thirst, the compassionate King gave him the last remaining water. 
In reality, all these guests were created by the Lord's māyā to test Rantideva's fortitude. They were, in a sense, forms of the Lord, but these forms, the śūdra, caṇḍāla, dogs and so on, were not His personal forms and thus cannot, strictly speaking, be considered worshipable. 
Here again is the answer to the question kva: Where does the Lord manifest a particular form? The answer is that it depends on His devotees. Bhagavan means the Lord who has inconceivable pow- ers, by which He manifests certain forms. This is the answer to katham: How does He manifest these forms? Paratman means that the Lord has unlimited forms and thus unlimited avataras. This is the answer to kati: How many forms and avatāras does He have? Finally, Yogeśvara means the master of the internal potency, called yoga-mäyä. By this potency all forms of the Lord exist in His one prin- cipal form, known as Kṛṣṇa. As such, Kṛṣṇa can manifest any form whatsoever, whenever it is appropriate to do so, in accordance with the maturation of a devotee's sadhana. This is the answer to kadā: When does the Lord manifest a particular form? 
In this way, though rhetorically asking four questions, Śrī Brahmā himself supplied the answers through the use of these four epithets. The essence is that all of Bhagavan's forms exist simultane- ously within His one form. Śrī Jiva will now conclude this anuccheda and the discussion of Sri Brahma's prayers with the next verse.

THEREFORE, all these various forms and universes are contained within the form of Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Śrī Brahma now concludes this topic by saying:

Therefore, this entire universe, which is insubstantial, like a dream, which covers consciousness, which is full of abundant and endless misery, and which arises out of Your maya potency, still appears as real because it is situated in You, who are limitless and possess a body that is eternal, full of bliss and consciousness. (SB 10.14.22)

The basic prose syntax of this verse yields the following: "Since Your form is thus [as shown in the previous verses] the original cause of all ephemeral and transcendental objects, this entire universe consequently appears within You, who are limitless and whose Self is identical with a body that is characterized by eternity, bliss and consciousness."

How does the universe appear? It appears as real (sat), and also as arising (udyad api), i.e., repeatedly appearing and disappear- ing. Though arising, it appears and disappears again and again. It exists in Him alone, from whom it appears and into whom it dissolves, just as earthen products arise from and dissolve into the earth.

Brahma answers, "No. That is why I say [that the universe arises] 'out of Your māyā,' or, in other words, through Your special incon- ceivable potency. I am assured of this because the Brahma-sutra states, 'But [God or Brahman is established as being free from all such modifications], because scripture declares this to be the case, and it is only through the scriptural revelation that we can learn about Him' (vs 2.1.27). This clearly indicates that in the act of creation Your energies are transformed (pariņāma) without any transformation occurring in You.

"And because the universe is a product of the ignorance feature of māyā, it is called asta-dhiṣana, or that which covers the living being's awareness of the supreme goal. For these two reasons, it is a place of great misery, since any semblance of happiness here is, in reality, simply misery. And without Your (i.e., the Lord's) existence, it would be completely unreal (asat-svarupa), a phantasmagoria, like the horns of a rabbit. Although it is such, the universe appears real (sat) or imperishable; the words 'to the bewildered' (mugdha), should be added to complete the sense." 
उपलक्षणं चैतद् व्यवहारज्ञानमयमहदाद्यात्मकत्वाज् ज्ञानोद्बोधकमिव स्वर्गाद्यात्मकत्वात् सुखमिव च । 
The preposition "as" (iva), applied here to the word "real" (sat), should be understood to apply to knowledge and happiness also. In other words, to the bewildered, the universe appears as a source of knowledge, because it is composed of elements, like mahat (the cosmic intellect), which embody empirical knowl- edge. They also view it as a source of happiness because it has ephemeral pleasures, such as those in heaven.

Therefore, the universe is limited or pervaded by the form of the Lord, but Bhagavan's form, by virtue of the power of His internal potency, is both limited and unlimited simultaneously. This is the import of the entire topic discussed in this anuccheda.

Now ŚRI JIVA CONCLUDES the topic of the simultaneous all-per- vasiveness and apparent limitedness of Krsna's body, based on this series of verses from Brahma-stava. In the previous section, 
361 
andy Śrī Bhagavat Sandarbha wife 
Śrila Jiva Gosvāmi explained that Bhagavan's body has inconceiv- able power and thus His body, although one, contains innumerable forms. Now he explains that because of this inconceivable power, the endlessly mutable material world has the appearance of being eternal. This is the reason for the use of the word tasmat (therefore), at the beginning of the verse. 
Śrī Brahma here lists three attributes of the material world: asat- svarupa (ephemeral by nature), asta-dhişana (devoid of conscious- ness) and puru-duḥkha-duḥkha (replete with misery). In contrast, the verse lists three attributes of the Lord's body: nitya (eternality), sukha (bliss) and bodha (consciousness). Thus, the Lord's form is eternal, full of bliss and consciousness, whereas the material world is temporary, full of misery and ignorance. 
One may wonder how this is possible, since an effect depends on its cause. It was mentioned in passing in the previous section, that Bhagavan is both the efficient as well as the material cause of the universe. The material cause refers to the raw materials that go into making something, like the clay in a pot. But if the Lord has the nature of sat, cit and ananda, how can the universe be asat, acit and nirānanda? 
Moreover, when we speak of a material cause, the implication generally is that the raw materials undergo some kind of transfor- mation. Is this the case when the Lord produces this universe out of Himself? Brahma replies that such is not the case, because of the Lord's inconceivable power (māyā). Although the material world emanates from the Lord, exists in Him, and dissolves into Him, its characteristics are completely different than His. de jud bol 
vs 2.1.27 referred to by Śri Jiva confirms the truth that the Lord creates the universe from His own Self and yet does not undergo any transformation. He is like a touchstone that can turn iron into gold and yet remain unchanged. Or, He is like a wish-fulfilling tree that can grant anything without undergoing any transformation, or without using anything external to itself. Since Bhagavan possesses inconceivable power, He can perform acts that are otherwise impos- sible. Just because He performs inconceivable or inexplicable acts, there is no reason to dismiss them as impossible.

The Lord's māyā potency performs another wonderful feat. It makes the temporary material world appear eternal to foolish peo- ple, and so they accept the temporary material body as permanent, despite the constant reminder of the inevitability of death. Accord- ing to Yudhisthira Mahārāja, this is the greatest wonder of life. 
Śrila Jiva Gosvāmi says that the words sad iva avabhāti (appears real or eternal), also apply, by extension, to the other two attributes, namely bliss and consciousness. Although the material world is full of misery to a person endowed with discrimination even tem- porary so-called happiness is misery - yet by hearing stimulating accounts of heavenly pleasure, or by experiencing mental-egoic sat- isfaction resulting from sense indulgence, people mistake the mate- rial world to be blissful. There is no absolute happiness in this mate- rial world; happiness is just a mental concept that varies from one species to another, from one person to another, from one stage of life to another, from one day to another, and indeed from morning to evening. 
al A cultured person may feel an irresistible urge to vomit when he sees the food relished by vultures. Even among humans, a rich per- son may find inedible what is a banquet to an impoverished person. One man's food is another man's poison. Even in the course of one life, we become disinterested in our former childhood pleasures and diversions. We observe that when a person takes sincerely to spiri- tual life, he or she practically abandons their previous life style. Our moods change from morning to evening. What one relishes at break- fast may appear distasteful at supper. Even that consumed at the beginning of a meal may appear distasteful by the end. 
The inescapable conclusion is that the so-called happiness of material life, even if real, is temporary. Furthermore, this apparent pleasure does not lie within sense objects. Otherwise, a particular sense object would grant equal happiness to everyone. In reality, the concept of pleasure lies within the mind. Thus, the saying goes, "Beauty is in the eye of the beholder." In this regard Niti-śästra says: 
3 Quoted in Section 10.1. 
363 
girŚrī Bhagavat Sandarbha 
The same object viewed by three different individuals appears in three different ways. When a yogi sees a beautiful young woman, he considers her body to be but a bag of stool, urine, blood, bones, le 5 mucus, pus and so on. A young man, however, sees her as his most desirable object of pleasure. A hungry dog sees her as a delicious piece of meat.*

353 It is very difficult, therefore, to discern where happiness lies. The simple fact is that there is no happiness in inert, ignorant, tempo- rary and miserable material objects. The sage Parāśara says: 
The same object induces misery, happiness, envy and anger in dif- ferent people. How can one categorically determine the nature of an object? One particular object sometimes even invokes love, pain, anger and happiness in the same person. Therefore, material objects do not have the capacity to grant happiness or inflict pain. Feelings of happiness and distress are simply mental states. (VP 2.6.47-49)5 
rtoire 
Patanjali says that for a discriminating person, everything is misery. The technical term for these different mental states is vṛtti. From our bank of experience in this and previous lives, we have developed an internal mechanism that represents a particu- lar state as pleasurable or not. In ignorance, we identify with the mind and its collective body of impressions, and the mental state we are presently experiencing dictates whether we feel ourselves to be happy or miserable.ghi 
We pursue sense objects in the belief that sense pleasure equals happiness, but in Bhagavad Gita, Śrī Kṛṣṇa refers to sense objects as the source of misery. He says, "Pleasures, or experiences (bhogāḥ),

arising out of contact with sense objects are simply sources of misery, having both beginning and end. Consequently, a wise person does not delight in them" (ye hi samsparsa-ja bhoga duḥkha-yonaya eva te, GĪTĀ 5.22). Duḥkha-yoni means "the source of misery." Real joy is a quality of spirit, not of inert matter. 
Opportunities to experience happiness and distress through con- tact with material objects result from karma. Karma never impels us to suffer or enjoy, however, it simply presents a particular, value- free situation. It is up to us how that event is interpreted. If we become slaves to our senses, then we are bound to suffer or enjoy a particular situation according to the bank of our past impressions. But if we have developed the eye of wisdom (jñāna-cakṣus), we will not be thus affected. Śrī Kṛṣṇa says, "Endowed with the wisdom of yoga, one abandons both good and evil even in this life" (buddhi- yukto jahätiha ubhe sukṛta-duskṛte, GĪTĀ 2.50). He also says:w 
916 
As a blazing fire reduces firewood to ashes, O Arjuna, so does the fire of knowledge reduce all karma to ashes. (GĪTĀ 4.37)" 
Therefore, mugdha, or bewildered, means one who has not devel- oped the eye of discrimination, cultured through assimilation of scriptural truth. Devotees awakened to this truth, however, have an entirely different vision of the universe. They see everything in relation to Kṛṣṇa. Owing to this understanding, they neither crave, nor are threatened by, any of nature's phenomena, regard- ing everything, rather, as the energy of the Lord, to be brought into harmonious relation through service. So, although the Lord admits that sense objects are the sources of misery, duḥkha-yonayaḥ, they become a source of pleasure for devotees, through offering them to the Lord. Jñana-märgis aspire to renounce everything, but devotees have no such threat from material objects.

Some philosophers consider the material world to be illusory, having no factual existence, and they compare it to a dream. They say that a dream has no factual existence, since no one experiences

it while awake; similarly, this material world is false, mithya, since it is no longer experienced upon the awakening to realization. 
Śrī Brahma does not accept this view. He does not consider the material world to be imaginary, the mere product of one's ignorance. In this verse, asat does not mean "falsehood" (mithya), but rather "transient." The reasoning is that since the material world exists as a potency of the Lord, who exists eternally, it too has existence. Here the word māyā means, "inconceivable power," and not, "magic." The Lord is inclusive of such potency and that's why He is called Māyi, or the Lord of maya. This was discussed in detail in Section 21. Śruti also confirms, "All this shines forth after His brilliance" (yasya bhāsā sarvam idam vibhāti, śu 6.14). The shining is not false, but to mis- take inert, endlessly mutable matter for eternal transcendence is illusion. 
liva br boog dod znobard and 
When Brahma compares the material world to a dream, he does not mean that it is false or non-existent, for dreams are a different state of reality. In Govinda-bhāṣya to vs 2.2.29, Śrīla Baladeva Vidya- bhūṣaṇa writes that objects in a dream do not have the same char- acteristics as those in the waking state. Objects seen in a dream are memories of objects previously experienced while awake. Objects in a dream may change instantly, while those seen in the waking state have extended continuity. 
190 
According to Śrīla Vyasadeva, the Supreme Lord actually gen- erates the objects of the dream state. They are real, but differ, in that the Lord creates them for a temporary purpose, for a particular self. The external world is created for all jivas, for a sustained period. Vyasa states this in the following sutra, "The dream state is also a creation of the Lord, because scripture declares it as such" (sandhye sṛṣṭir āha hi, vs 3.2.1). Here sandhya (junction) means "dreams," as indicated in Brhad-aranyaka Upanisad - sandhyam tṛtiyaṁ svapna- sthānam (BAU 4.3.9). lainstem ut nabienos 
Idg smo2 According to Śrila Baladeva Vidyabhūṣaṇa, the scriptures referred to by this sūtra are mantras, such as:

When a sober person realizes that the objects he perceives while awake or asleep are due to the omnipresent, indwelling Self, he 
366 
41 The Lord's Body Contains Everything 
grieves no more. Dreams are real and they are creations of the Lord's māyā potency. (KU 2.1.4)8 
Another reason dreams are considered real is that they some- times indicate pending events in reference to the waking state. Śrī- mad Bhagavatam describes that when Kṛṣṇa and Balarama arrived in Mathura, Kamsa detected bad omens while awake and in his dreams as well. These were indicative of his imminent death: 
rotada 
He dreamt that he was being embraced by ghosts, riding a donkey de and drinking poison, and also that a naked man smeared with oil newas passing by, wearing a garland of nalada flowers. (SB 10.42.30) v vlamis 
If dreams were unreal, they could not indicate a real incident. In the waking state, a person enjoys or suffers the results of his past karma; similarly, his dreams bring him suffering or enjoyment. Pos- itive dreams are the result of good karma, and disturbing dreams, the result of bad karma. The Lord allocates the result of karma during our waking state. He does the same in our dream state. 
According to Manu-samhita, reactions for actions performed by the body, mind and speech affect their respective sources: 
bEmbodied beings experience the reactions of positive and negative A mental acts through the mind, the reactions of positive and negative al physical acts through the body, and the result of positive and nega- beative vocal acts through the organ of speech. (MANU 12.8)109lgnings 
Since every physical action is preceded by a mental action, men- tal karma is more extensive and needs to be worked out in dreams, as a supplement to the waking state. Thus, during sleep, as well as during the waking state, one experiences the reactions of mental karma. Dreams present an admixture of experience, and the arising of events is in no way bound to logical or sequential order. Whatever

one witnesses in dreams, however, is a mixture of what has been experienced in this life or a past life. Śrī Narada confirms this to king Prācīnabarhi: 
bens bizno 
radion 
Sometimes we suddenly experience forms or other phenomena that nt we have never known, seen or heard in our present life. O King, 
know that these constructs arise out of the subtle body, or the psy-M che, for there is no possibility of mental imaging without the prior act of perception. (SB 4.29.64-65)" 
Or The commentary states that these unfamiliar experiences that have no apparent relation to our present life, occur in the mind, as in dreams. This shows that dreams are not phantasmagoria, but simply a state or field of consciousness defined by different parameters. 
Similarly, the material world is not mithya, as described in the slogan of the Brahmavāda, brahma satyam jagan mithya. What is mithyā, rather, is to view it independently of Brahman. It is real, yet without substantiality, being a product of the Lord's inferior potency. By the Lord's existence, awareness and bliss, however, the world is programmed or designed so as to be viewed as permanent, and as apparent knowledge and delight. 
Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī says that without the existence of the Lord, the universe would have no being, just like the horns of a rabbit. A rabbit has no horns, and thus the statement, "horns of a rabbit," is meaningless. In Sanskrit, a meaningless statement is not considered a true statement. Kavi Karṇapūra gives an example of such a non- statement: 
ed

This son of a barren woman appears so beautiful, with a chaplet of sky flowers on his head, holding a bow made of rabbit horns, and/ Rofattired in garments made from the hair of a tortoise. (Alankara-

41 The Lord's Body Contains Everything 
Just as this verse is meaningless, the world would, similarly, have no meaning without the Lord's existence. Therefore, Śrī Kṛṣṇa says, "With but a single fragment of Myself, I pervade and support this entire cosmos" (viştabhyaham idam kṛtsnam ekāmsena sthito jagat, GĪTĀ 10.42). 
spaber In the following anuccheda, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī will further dis- cuss the all-pervasiveness of Śrī Kṛṣṇa's body.

Kṛṣṇa's Form Can Manifest in Innumerable Places Simultaneously 
४२ । तदित्थं मध्यमाकार एव सर्वाधारत्वाद् विभुत्वं साधितम् । सर्वगतत्वादपि साध्यते ( भा० १० । ६९।२) - 
IN THIS WAY, it has been established that the Lord's medium- sized body is all-pervading (vibhutva), by showing that it is the support of everything. This all-pervading feature will now be demonstrated by exhibiting its quality of being present every- where (sarvagata):

Narada Muni thought, "It is amazing that Kṛṣṇa has alone, in a single body, been able to separately marry 16,000 wives, each in their individual palaces, and to do so simultaneously." (SB 10.69.2)1

How did Kṛṣṇa perform this feat? Was it in one form with many hands and legs that was expanded through all the 16,000 houses? "No, no, don't think like that." According to Uddhava, it is well known that He accepted a particular suitable form for each of the princesses:

Having manifested, by His internal potency, an equal number of forms, matching those of the princesses, Kṛṣṇa married them in with the appropriate rituals at one and the same auspicious time, Yn though in different palaces. (SB 3.3.8)2 of ai terit. (d) 290sley 97801 slog

With this intent in mind, Narada dispels all possibility of doubt or of antithetical interpretation by a single word placed in the first half of the verse - prthak, i.e., different or separately. Kṛṣṇa underwent the wedding ceremony in just one humanlike form, which was seen differently at different places. Thus, the great- est cause for astonishment was that this one humanlike form was present simultaneously in all these different places [i.e., palaces] and in all actions [i.e., the wedding ceremonies]. This is the literal meaning of the verse.

In the same way, in commenting on a prose passage from the Fifth Canto, describing the form of the Lord, the presiding deity of all planets, Śrīdhara Svāmi writes, "Because He is the mas- ter of all supreme opulence, He pervades everything with just one form" (Bhāvārtha-dipikā 5.20.40). [In another description of these marriages] Śrī Śuka also states:

Then, assuming as many forms as there were brides, Bhaga- havan Śrī Kṛṣṇa married all the princesses at the same auspicious hotmoment, each in her own palace. (SB 10.59.42)* 
200 
इत्यत्राप्यतस्तावद्रूपत्वं नाम युगपत् तावत्प्रदेशप्रकाशत्वमेवेति व्याख्येयम् । न तु नारा- यणादिवद् भिन्नाकारत्वम् । यथोक्तम् (श्रीसङ्क्षेपभागवतामृतम् १।२१) - 
Therefore, the phrase "assuming as many forms as there were brides" (tāvad-rupa-dhara) should be understood to mean that He manifested (prakāśa) His one form simultaneously in all those places. It does not mean that He expanded Himself into different looking forms, such as those of Nārāyaṇa and others. The term prakāśa is defined in Laghu-bhāgavatamṛta: 
अनेक प्रकटता रूपस्यैकस्य यैकदा । 
सर्वथा तत्स्वरूपैव स प्रकाश इतीर्यते ॥ १६२ ॥ इति । 
The appearance of a single form in many places at the same time, but which is, in all respects, the same essential form (svarupa) of the Lord, is called prakāśa. (LBH 1.21)5 
01 19VS 30amder 
एष एवान्यत्राकारस्य प्रकाशस्य च भेदो ज्ञेयः ॥ श्रीनारदः ॥ 
This is the difference between the Lord's prakāśa and the forms that appear different [such as Nārāyaṇa]. 
Commentary 
IN THE PREVIOUS SECTION, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi established that the Lord's body, although medium-sized, is the support of everything and is thus all-pervading. In the next three anucchedas, he will again demonstrate that the Lord's medium-sized body is all-pervading because it exists everywhere, and yet remains one. To illustrate this, he refers to Śrī Kṛṣṇa's pastime of marrying 16,000 wives.

ValmacŚrī Bhagavat Sandarbha mafanye a 
The demon Bhaumasura lived in Pragjyotiṣapura, near Kama- rupa in present-day Assam. He was so powerful that he troubled even the devas. So, Indra approached Śrī Kṛṣṇa in Dvārakā and pleaded with Him to kill Bhauma. The Lord, ever-willing to protect the gods, mounted Garuda and went to Pragjyotiṣapura, where He slayed the demon after a fierce battle. 
Bhauma had kidnapped 16,000 princesses from various kings and had been holding them captive in his palace. Upon being res- cued by the Lord, they all desired to marry Him, and so Kṛṣṇa took them all back to Dvaraka with Him. af dem ton asob 120g 
In accordance with Vedic customs, the Lord consulted astrologers to determine a suitable auspicious moment (muhurta) for His 16,000 weddings. Since a muhurta lasts just forty-eight minutes, the Lord had to marry all the princesses simultaneously. But even if we did not take this into account and Kṛṣṇa had married a single princess each day, it would have taken forty-three years, ten months and five days to marry them all. He therefore married them simultaneously by His yogic power. 
This display was a source of astonishment, even to great mas- ters of yoga, like Narada Muni, who went to Dvarakā to observe the Lord's daily activities and learned that He had performed such a won- der. As a result, he spoke the verse that is under discussion in this section. 
Jiva Gosvāmi comments on the verse by presenting it in conver- sational form, raising anticipated doubts and using words from the verse to respond to them. 
one 
Doubt: Why was Narada astonished? 
Answer: Because Krsna had married 16,000 wives. 
Doubt: What's so surprising about that? Many kings throughout history have had hundreds and even thousands of wives. 
2161 
Answer: But the queens were in 16,000 different palaces. 
Doubt: What's so wonderful about that? He was a king possessing great riches. He was able to afford a palace for each of His queens. 
Answer: He married them with individual wedding ceremonies in each of these 16,000 palaces. 
374 
42 Kṛṣṇa's Form Can Manifest in Innumerable Places Simultaneously 
Doubt: That could be managed by going from one palace to another, so what is so amazing? quish yili od vrtom n 
Answer: He did it at precisely the same moment, at the same aus- picious muhurta. 
Doubt: Kṛṣṇa is called Yogeśvara, the master of yogic power. Accomplished yogis can expand into many bodies, called kaya-vyūha. He could easily have expanded into 16,000 such kaya-vyūhas to participate in these rituals. 
zid 
otinam 
Answer: No, He did not expand into many different bodies. He married them all simultaneously in one body. This is what was so surprising to Narada. 
Doubt: He could have produced 32,000 hands, etc., like in the virat form, and accepted 16,000 wives in 16,000 houses simultane- ously. 
Answer: No. He had a suitable form for each woman and yet these were all one and the same form. This is confirmed by the state- ments of Sukadeva Gosvāmī (SB 10.59.42) and Śrī Uddhava (SB 3.3.8), cited in this anuccheda. villators of 
All these forms of Bhagavan are His original form, which are called prakāśa manifestations. They are not like His Nārāyaṇa or Vasudeva expansions. Sukadeva Gosvāmi accepts them as one: to agbelvion diw 
In this way, it is said that Devarși Narada saw the same Śrī Kṛṣṇa present in every palace, executing the virtuous religious duties meant for the purification of married couples. (SB 10.69.41) anavegada 
This was the reason for Śrī Närada's surprise. Narada Muni was himself a great master of yogic power and could perform many extraordinary and miraculous feats. He had the power to expand into kaya-vyuha forms, which look exactly the same and perform identical movements. If Śrī Kṛṣṇa's expansions were also kaya- vyuha, then Śrī Narada Muni would not have been amazed. We generally feel surprised when we see something new, some extraor- dinary act or object that has never previously been experienced.

Śaubhari Muni expanded himself into fifty kaya-vyuha forms in order to marry the fifty daughters of King Mandhātā. Śrī Kṛṣṇa's 16,000 forms were not this kind of kaya-vyuha expansion. His prakāśa forms could be seen acting differently in different places, but the kaya-vyuha forms of Saubhari Muni and other powerful yogis have no such independent functioning capacity. 
od Śrila Rūpa Gosvāmi has made a minute analysis of the various manifestations of the Lord in his Laghu-bhāgavatamṛta. He there 
says: 
In His transcendental abodes, the Lord appears in three differ- ent ways, namely, as svayam-rüpa, tad-ekātma-rupa and äveśa. WHY (LBH 1.11) bad boose 
Svayam-rupa is the original form of Śri Krsna, which does not depend on any other form. In this form the Lord sometimes manifests two hands and sometimes four. For one lo 
(The form that is nondifferent in nature from the original one, but appears different owing to personality and pastimes, is called tad-ekātma-rupa. It is further divided into viläsa forms, such as Nārāyaṇa, and svāṁśa forms, such as Matsya and Kurma. These are different from the original form of Śrī Kṛṣṇa in appearance. 
When the Lord empowers a particular entity with knowledge or bhakti, those individuals are called äveśa-rupa. Examples of this are Śeṣa, Nārada, Sanaka and so on. 
Of these, the prakāśa manifestations are identical to Bhagavan's svayaṁ-rupa. Śrī Kṛṣṇa's expansions in the Rasa dance as well as the ones described in the Dvaraka weddings are examples of prakāśa. They are not related like parts to a whole. Although these forms can be seen acting differently at different places, they are all one. 
Sometimes Śrī Kṛṣṇa manifests a four-handed form, but this should not be considered different from the svayam-rupa. On the other hand, when He manifests the four-handed Nārāyaṇa or Viṣṇu form, that is not His original form. He does not manifest the same

qualities or pastimes in those forms. This facet of the Lord's being does not conform to mundane logic, but is certainly a transcenden- tal reality. It is but another example of how nothing is impossible for the Personal Nondual Absolute. 
Śrila Jiva Gosvāmi will continue to explain the all-pervading fea- ture of Śrī Kṛṣṇa's form in the next anuccheda.

४३ | तथैवाह (भा० १० । ६९ ।४१ ) - 
ŚRI SUKA made a similar statement:1 
इत्याचरन्तं सद्धर्मान् पावनान् गृहमेधिनाम् । तमेव सर्वगेहेषु सन्तमेकं ददर्श ह । १६३ ।।। 
In this way, it is said that Devarși Narada saw the same Śrī Kṛṣṇa present in every palace, executing the eternal religious duties meant for the purification of married couples. (SB 10.69.41)2 
सर्वगेहेषु तमेव न तु तस्यांशान् । एकमेव सन्तं न तु कायव्यूहेन बहुरूपम् “एकं सन्तं बहुधा दृश्यमानम्” इति श्रुतेः । “न चान्तर्न बहिर्यस्य” (भा० १०।९।१३) इत्यादिना विभुत्वसिद्धेश्च । 
Śrī Nārada directly saw Kṛṣṇa, and not His plenary expansions, in every one of the palaces. He was in one form, not in many forms expanded by kaya-vyuha. As the Vedas state, "Being one, He appears as many." His all-pervasiveness was earlier proven [in Section 31] by the verse, "Kṛṣṇa [...] who has neither inside nor outside" (SB 10.9.13). 
ह स्फुटमेव । ददर्श भगवद्दत्तशक्त्या साक्षादेवानुभूतवान् न तु केवलमनुमितवान् नारद इति शेषः । 
This statement is included in the description of Narada's visit to each of Kṛṣṇa's palaces in Dvārakā, where he observed the Lord's activities as a married man. 2ity acarantam sad-dharman pāvanān gṛha-medhinām

43 Śrī Kṛṣṇa Is the Paramātmā - I 
The indeclinable ha, in the above-cited verse, means that Narada Muni saw Him clearly. It is not that the form of the Lord was inferred, but rather Narada directly experienced seeing Him with the power bestowed upon him by the Lord. Though Nārada's name is not directly mentioned in this verse, it should be understood that he is the subject.

syrpvibeMyd ynw guiwollol sdi ni bani The term yoga-māyā here refers to the cit (conscious) potency, or the potency inhering in God's own interiority, or in other words, in the interiority of nondual Being. The nature of this conscious potency is that it accomplishes otherwise impossible tasks. In the Third Canto, where the visit of the Kumāras to Vaikuntha is described (SB 3.15.26), Śrīdhara Svāmī also explained that the word yoga-mäyä means cit potency when used in relation to the Lord.

various forms (kaya-vyuha) is possible for many sages like Närada, but the Lord, without recourse to such expansions, per- vades everything in His medium-sized form. This was unprece- dented; hence, this, and not anything else, was the cause of aston- ishment even for Narada. This should be clearly understood from the verse.

अनेन “सर्वतः पाणिपादं तत्” (गीता १३ । १३) इति तादृश्यां श्रीमूर्त्यामेव व्याख्यातं भवति । 
From this frame of reference, the verse, "Everywhere are His hands and legs [...]" (GĪTĀ 13.13), should also be understood to mean that the Lord pervades everything in His personal form. 
अत एव “न स्थानतोऽपि परस्योभयलिङ्गं सर्वत्र हि” (ब्र० सू० ३।२।११) इति सूत्रं तत्त्ववा - दिभिरेवं योजितम्“स्थानापेक्षयापि परमात्मनो न भिन्नं रूपं हि यस्मात् तद्रूपत्वं सर्वत्रैव” । “सर्वभूतेष्वेवमेव ब्रह्म इत्याचक्षते” इति श्रुतेः । 
Therefore, Brahma-sutra, "Because the Lord simultaneously exists everywhere, His various forms existing in different places are not different from one another" (vs 3.2.11), has been explained in the following way by Madhvācārya: "The innumer- able forms of Paramātmā are not different, despite their existing in different places separately. Hi implies - because His forms abound everywhere. The Vedas confirm this, 'In this way, the Lord exists in all beings." Matsya Purāņa states: addis 01 2018m ad to fiziv odi

One should similarly consult the Tattvavādi (Madhva) explana- tions given to the following two sutras, "If it is objected that these forms cannot be one because of being different, we reply 'no,' because of the counter statements found in scriptures" (vs 3.2.12), and, "Also, some teach in this way" (vs 3.2.13).10 
Commentary 
in proved an indi gris 
IN THIS SECTION, Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmi continues to explain Narada Muni's experience of observing Śrī Kṛṣṇa's family life in Dvaraka. He saw Śrī Kṛṣṇa in different palaces performing different activities. In one palace Kṛṣṇa was playing dice with Uddhava; in another He was performing a sacrifice; in yet another, He was eating or instruct- ing His sons, and so on. Śrī Sukadeva Gosvāmī summarizes Nārada's experience in the two verses that form the basis of this anuccheda. 
In SB 10.69.41, the words eka and santa are very significant. Eka (one) implies that although Narada saw the Lord in numerous palaces performing different activities, he understood Him to be one and the same person. Someone may think that as Narada trav- elled from one palace to another, the Lord arranged to quickly reach there before him. This doubt is dispelled by the word santa (while 
"pratidṛśam iva naikadhärkam ekaṁ

existing), which means that Narada understood that one Kṛṣṇa was existing in all the houses simultaneously. The word eva (only) indi- cates it was Śrī Kṛṣṇa and not any of His plenary expansions. Thus, they were prakāśa manifestations, as described at the end of the previous section. 
эгор

Furthermore, those forms were not kaya-vyūha forms, like the ones manifested by yogis, which are merely different bodies of the same person. Such expansions do not have the power to act inde- pendently of each other. There is no difference between Kṛṣṇa and His body-deha-dehi-vibhago'yam vidyate nesvare kvacit. He and His body are one, and this is the case with each form He reveals. Hence, all 16,000 forms are one. 
If these various manifestations of Kṛṣṇa were kāya-vyūha, 
Narada would not have marveled to see them. As stated above, one 
эпо feels astonished when witnessing something novel or extraordi- nary, or a performance that is beyond one's own ability. Nārada Muni, being a topmost transcendentalist in devotion, possesses many yogic powers. His astonishment, therefore, indicates that he had experienced something that was beyond his own powers. There- fore, the next verse reads, "this extraordinary display of yoga-māyā potency" (yoga-maya-mahodaya).il sin morosa on 
Yoga-māyā is Bhagavan's internal potency, which is far superior to the intermediary potency. This superior potency functions well beyond the limits that define the material energy and is therefore called aghatana-ghatana-patiyasi, or that which can accomplish acts impossible for the material energy. Different energies function in accordance with different laws. Heat energy, electric energy, light energy, magnetic energy, and so on, all exhibit different behavior and are governed by different sets of laws. But they are all within the realm of the material energy. Similarly, we can expect the inter- nal energy to behave differently from the material energy, being governed by a different grade of internal self-regulating principles. Śrī Kṛṣṇa describes this opulence to Arjuna in Bhagavad Gitā: 
382 
43 Śrī Kṛṣṇa Is the Paramātmā - I 
All around are His hands and feet, His eyes, heads, faces and ears. In w any this way, Paramātmā exists, pervading everything. (GĪTĀ 13.13)"og lam beM 
In this verse, Śrī Kṛṣṇa explains that He exists everywhere in His personal form through His prakāśa expansions. The phrase, "Everywhere are His hands," implies that His whole body pervades everything, not just His hands. One should not misconstrue this verse to mean that He pervades all things merely as formless undif- ferentiated being, underlying all forms, or that He does so through the living beings who are present everywhere. Rather, the precise understanding is that He pervades everything in a single personal form - sarvam āvṛtya tiṣṭhati. The singular number of the verb tişthati (exists) implies that He is one, though existing everywhere in many forms. 
To further corroborate this point, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi quotes three sutras from Brahma-sutra and the commentary of Śrīla Madhvācārya (Tattvavādi) on the first of these. Madhvacārya offers a unique expla- nation of these sutras: "The Lord is one though in different places."12 Logic proposes that objects in different places are different from each other, sthāna-bhedena sthänino'pi bhedat. If this holds true even in regard to the Lord, then He should be different when appearing in different locations. Śrīla Vyasa responds with sūtra vs 3.2.11, which rejects this objection because the Lord is one everywhere. 
Madhvācārya supports his position with quotes from the Vedas, Matsya Purana and Srimad Bhagavatam. He concludes that just as the one sun appears different to people living in different parts of the globe - some see it as rising, others as setting, yet others as high above at noon- similarly, the one Lord exists everywhere. This example has been given to show how a single object can be viewed as many. In the case of the Lord, He factually exists at all places, though remaining one. This is inconceivable to the mundane mind. 
In explaining the remaining two sūtras, Madhvācārya quotes more references from the Vedas, such as Bṛhad-aranyaka Upanisad, 
12 
sarvataḥ pāņi-pādam tat sarvato 'ksi-siro-mukham 
sarvataḥ śrutimal loke sarvam avṛtya tisthati 
sthānāpekṣayāpi paramatmano na bhinnaṁ rūpaṁ 
383 
Śri Bhagavat Sandarbha 
which states that the Lord appears everywhere by His own inter- nal potency, and yet is one. In his Anuvyakhyāna on the sutras, Madhvācārya summarizes this point with the following verse: 
egy air t 
The Lord, who is the Supreme Controller, is not different, though bexisting in different places simultaneously. Everywhere He is id completely free from defects and possesses all transcendentally 
auspicious qualities.13 
Śrī Baladeva Vidyabhusaṇa, following in the footsteps of Śrī Madhvācārya, quotes Bṛhad-aranyaka Upanisad, indro māyābhiḥ puru-rupa iyate (BAU 2.5.19). He writes that the word indra means the Supreme Lord, and mayă refers to the internal potency, which has three divisions - hladini, sandhini and samvit. These are Bhaga- van's eternal potencies. Indra, or the Lord, is one, though having many forms. 
In his explanation of vs 3.2.11, Śrīla Madhvācārya cited Bhis- madeva's testimony from Srimad Bhagavatam. In the following anu- ccheda, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi presents a detailed analysis of this verse, using it to show how the one Lord exists everywhere.

Being free from the delusion of duality, I have come to under- stand that Kṛṣṇa, who is situated before me, is one. Though He is unborn, He appears in the hearts of all embodied beings, who have been manifested from within Him, just as the sun is one, though appearing differently to everyone. (SB 1.9.42)1

But now I have understood Him to be one, having a sin- gle form, even though He seems to have separate forms when He resides in everyone's heart as Paramātmā. This supremely bliss- ful form [of Kṛṣṇa] is itself all-pervading. He manifests in every- one's heart in His special form as Paramātmā, which is contained within Himself. I have realized this, because now I am free from the delusion of duality (vidhūta-bheda-moha). Under this delu- sion I thought it impossible for one form of the Lord to be simul- taneously all-pervasive, and concluded that it must thus be many. By the mercy of this very form, this delusion has been dispelled. तेषु व्यापकत्वे हेतुः आत्मकल्पितानामात्मन्येव परमाश्रये प्रादुष्कृतानाम् । 
The reason for His pervading these embodied beings is that the various embodied beings have been manifest from within Him (ätma-kalpitānām), the supreme shelter.

The following example is given: "The sun appears differently to everyone who views it (pratidṛśa)." To the vision of different peo- ple situated in different places, the same sun appears in various ways - such as, how it appears when it is above a tree or a wall, how it appears in its entirety, when vision is unobstructed, and yet again, how it appears partially, when vision is obstructed. The Lord is similarly one, but appears as separate in everyone's heart. This example is to be taken only in the partial sense that both Kṛṣṇa and the sun are one while appearing in all these differ- ent places. The distinction between them is that Krsna's divine form appears in this way through His inconceivable potency, whereas the sun does so because it is distant and expansive in 
nature.

An alternative explanation of the verse is as follows: I now realize that the form I described earlier as sitting in front of me is also in the heart of every living being. Although the form of Paramātmā is different [in appearance] from this form [of Krsna], at present I am seeing this selfsame form present in all those hearts. The import is that because of the supreme influence of this form, no other form can be perceived in its presence. This illustration is given to show that the Lord's form is one, even though present in different places, and not to show the completeness or incomplete- ness of one form or the other.

By studying this entire section [dealing with Bhismadeva's medi- tation], from its introduction ("With unblinking eyes, he beheld the Lord [...],” sB 1.9.30), to its conclusion (Absorbing himself in the Self, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, by the functions of his mind, speech and body [...],” SB 1.9.43), it is clear that their subject is Bhagavān's personal form. Therefore, this verse should not be interpreted as referring to the unqualified Brahman aspect of the Absolute Truth. 
तदेवं परिच्छिन्नत्वापरिच्छिन्नत्वयोर्युगपत् स्थितेः “अचरं चरमेव च ” (गीता १३ । १६ ) इत्ये- तदप्यत्र सुसङ्गच्छते । अतो विभुत्वेऽपि लीलाया याथार्थ्यं सिद्ध्यति ॥ भीष्मः श्रीभगव- न्तम् ॥ dotovi 
co ameiros Nazmi bred In this way, since Bhagavan's form is simultaneously limited and unlimited, the verse of Bhagavad Gita, "He is movable and immovable [...]" (GITA 13.16), is highly relevant in the present context. So, though the Lord is all-pervading, His pastimes [in a humanlike form] are real.

Commentary Simon 
क 
THE PERSONAL EXPERIENCE OF BHIŞMA, one of the twelve author- ities on bhāgavata-dharma, also provides an instance of how Bhaga- vän, though one, appears in many places. After fighting in the battle of Kuruksetra for ten days, Bhiṣmadeva suddenly stopped when he saw Śikhaṇḍī in front of him. Sikhandi had been born a female, but was later transformed into a man by the blessings of a Gandharva. Bhisma, however, would not accept him as a genuine male and so refused to do battle when confronted by him. As a he did 
Satriya, not consider it appropriate to fight a woman. 
Arjuna took this opportunity to attack and riddled Bhisma's entire body with sharp arrows. Since Bhisma had received a boon that he could die at the moment of his own choosing, he decided to wait fifty-two days for the auspicious moment of the winter solstice before leaving his body. During this whole time, he lay on the bed of arrows that transpierced his body. 
After the battle, Kṛṣṇa and the Pandavas went to pay their respects to Bhisma and to hear from him the elaborate instructions on dharma that are found in Mahabharata, Santi-parva. The Bha- gavatam verse quoted in this anuccheda is taken from the prayers Bhiṣmadeva offered to Krsna just before his final departure. 
Bhisma identifies Paramātmā, seated in the heart of every liv- ing being, with Kṛṣṇa, who is sitting before him. He says that he has now become free from the delusion of duality, under the influ- ence of which, one considers Paramātmā different from Kṛṣṇa, or that Paramātmā in each heart is different. As stated in KU 2.1.12, "The Lord, occupying the dimension of the thumb, sits within each heart." This Paramātmā is nondifferent from Kṛṣṇa, as the Lord Himself confirms to Arjuna (sarvasya caham hrdi sanniviṣṭaḥ, GĪTĀ 15.15). 
Those who cling to the formless conception of the Absolute can- not conceive that the Lord's personal form can be all-pervading. This 
11.02 
* Bhisma's instructions on dharma are found in chapter 47 of Mahabharata (critical 
edition).

is their māyā, or delusion, because they unwittingly impose conven- tion and limitation on the Absolute through their a priori assump- tions about the nature of form and formlessness. By the mercy of the Lord, however, one is freed from this delusion and can realize that the Lord exists everywhere. Such a person is called a bhāgavata, or a worshiper of the complete personal nondual Whole. 
Vidhūta-bheda-moha (free from the delusion of duality) means to be free from the mistaken idea that the Lord's forms are many in number, in other words, to awaken to the vision of unity within all the Lord's forms. This does not mean, however, that one perceives absolute nondifference between the Lord and the living beings. In Bhismadeva's verse, the pronoun tam (to Him) is in the singular and refers to Kṛṣṇa. Hrdi hrdi (within each heart) implies a plurality of living beings. Thus, Bhisma is not alluding to Krsna and the jiva as being one, but to the oneness of Kṛṣṇa, sitting directly before him, and Paramātmā, seated within each heart. 
Bhiṣmadeva illustrates his point with the example of the sun. The sun is one, but it appears differently to different people at different times and in different places. In the morning the sun appears big and red to one viewer, but to another viewer located further east and for whom it is midday, the same sun appears small and white. In the meantime, someone still further east is experiencing it as set- ting. To all three the sun appears differently, even though they may be viewing it at the same precise moment. 
The sun may even be visible either partially or fully to those in the same vicinity, depending on whether their vision is clear or obstructed by some other object. A person of knowledge, how- ever, knows that the sun is one and unchanging, and only appears different to different people, according to their frame of reference. 
Similarly, the Supreme Lord is one but appears as many. The example of the sun is given specifically to illustrate the oneness of the Lord's forms and should not be misunderstood to indicate that the Lord is situated in only one place, like the sun. The Lord exists everywhere in His personal form, yet He is one. This is due to His inconceivable potency. He is not different from His other forms. A material object at a particular place is different from a similar object 
389 
Śri Bhagavat Sandarbha 
now 
in another place. Or more precisely, a material object cannot exist in two locations simultaneously. But this empirically observable fact applies to material objects only and not to the Lord, because space and time cannot limit His body. Śrī Kṛṣṇa is not subordinate to space and time, but rather, He controls them. If He could not, He would not be the Supreme Person. on bios sislomda att fotogidas sho 67 Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi explains Bhisma's vision in two ways, but since the hermeneutical rule of scriptural interpretation asserts that subsequent explanations are superior to previous ones (pūrvā- parayoḥ para-vidhir balavän), he favors the latter. In the first expla- nation, Jīva says that Bhisma understood that Paramātmā and Śrī Kṛṣṇa are one. According to the second view, Bhisma actually saw Śrī Kṛṣṇa, and not Paramātmā, in the heart of every being. This is indeed amazing. Due to the powerful influence of Śrī Kṛṣṇa's per- sonal feature, Bhiṣmadeva did not see Paramātmā [in His own char- acteristic feature]. He was completely absorbed in seeing Kṛṣṇa's personal form, and thus saw one Kṛṣṇa everywhere. baraids 
This verse should not be interpreted as referring to formless, unqualified Brahman. Why? Because Bhisma's consciousness was fixed on the personal qualified Brahman, not on His indeterminate feature. This is evident from two verses spoken by Sūta Gosvāmī at the beginning and end of Bhismadeva's prayers: 
Thereafter, Bhisma, the best among thousands of warriors, inter- rupted his speech and, exclusively fixing his mind, which was abso- lutely free from material attachments, beheld, with unblinking eyes, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Person, who was present before him in His four-armed form, clad in shining yellow robes. (SB 1.9.30)6 
que vino has aguigendamtesano aí nua hadi zwol Absorbing himself in the Self, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, through the functions of his mind, speech and body, he gave up his life-force. (SB 1.9.43)" 
Both these verses clearly indicate that Bhisma's mind, speech and eyes were completely fixed on Kṛṣṇa's personal features. The

opening and closing statements of an essay indicate the intention of the author. Therefore, Bhisma's realization could not have been of the formless or unqualified. 
Because the Lord's body is all-pervading and yet one, it is possible for Him to engage in His transconventional pastimes. The followers of Sankarācārya, owing to ignorance, consider Kṛṣṇa's pastimes to be an empirical reality only, and not absolute. They do not under- stand that Kṛṣṇa's personal form is all-pervading. Unless one sees through this misconception, he cannot free himself of the limita- tions inherent within the radically unqualified view of the Absolute. Until one overcomes this block, the possibility of devotion, which is necessarily in relation to the personal Absolute, cannot arise.

THUS, IT HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED that Bhagavan's form is eternal and all-pervading. Śrīdhara Svāmī has explained this in exactly the same way in his commentary on the sixth chapter of the Eighth Canto, which he summarizes in verse form as follows:

Brahma establishes that the Lord's body is eternal and all- pervading by saying, "It is not that the Lord's body did not exist previously and has appeared now, but it existed before and has only now become visible." (Bhāvārtha-dipikā 8.6.8)1

To convey this, Brahma says, 'You who have never been subject to birth, continuance or dissolution.' Why is that? 'Because You transcend the material gunas (agunaya) and are thus an ocean of bliss in the form of complete cessation of material existence (nirvana).' In other words, You are the embodiment of the unlim- ited bliss of liberation (mokṣa). Moreover, You are 'finer than the atom,' i.e., extremely subtle, due to being difficult to com- prehend. Factually speaking, 'Your abodes are beyond counting,' i.e., there is no way to calculate the number of Your forms. It is not to be thought impossible [that such a person exists], because You are 'most exalted' (mahanubhava), i.e., Your magnificence is inconceivable. Unto such a being as You, I bow down.

To convey this, Brahma uses the expletives u and ha, which are exclamations of astonishment as well as indications that something is self-evident. 'In Your form I see all of us devas along with the three planetary systems.' Brahma then gives the reason behind this, 'Since the whole universe is contained within Your body (viśva-mürteḥ), therefore, Your form is not limited by anything."" Śrīdhara Svämis's explanation ends here.

The bliss relished by embodied beings through meditation on Your lotus feet, or through hearing stories of [or by] Your devo- tees, is not available even in Brahman, which is Your glory. How W then can it be enjoyed by the devas, who fall down from their hairplanes, which are destroyed by the sword of death? (SB 4.9.10)

After having said that the Lord's form is "finer than the atom" (anor animne), the statement, "whose forms are immeasur- able," indicates that by His supreme opulence, or inconceiv- able magnificence (mahanubhavaya), His form is the basis of all measurement. This unique feature of His should also be understood.

IN THE LAST FEW SECTIONS, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi has shown that Bha- gavan's form is one, eternal and all-pervading. This is the conclusion of the Vedas, Vedānta-sutra, Smṛtis and of the sages as well. To fur- ther strengthen this point, he now refers to Śrīdhara Svāmi, the well known commentator and authority on Śrimad Bhāgavatam, who is accepted even by the followers of Sankarācārya. 
According to VP 1.9, Durvāsā Muni, who is renowned for losing his temper, was once returning from Vaikuntha when he met King

Indra riding on his elephant, Airavata. Durväsä honored the Lord of the three worlds by offering him Śrī Visnu's garland. Indra, how- ever, was intoxicated by his elevated position and heavenly opu- lence. Indifferent to the sage's gift, he threw it onto the head of his elephant, who let it fall to the ground and there trampled it. Durvāsā was enraged at this lack of respect and he cursed Indra to be deprived of his wealth and glamor. 
Indra was so confounded by the loss of his opulences that he sought the help of Śrī Brahma, who in turn approached Śrī Viṣņu. When Śrī Viṣņu appeared, only Brahma and Śiva could see Him. Beholding that resplendent form of Śrī Vişņu, Brahmā began recit- ing prayers. These prayers are cited in the Eighth Canto of Śrimad Bhāgavatam? 
In the verse quoted at the beginning of this anuccheda, from his Bhāvārtha-dipikā commentary, Śrīdhara Svāmī summarizes the pur- port of Brahma's prayers. The verse contains the word abhipraiti (establishes), which implies a definite conclusion. To show how Śrīdhara Svāmi's summary verse is justified, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi then cites the first two verses of the series along with Sridhara Svāmi's comments.ona all to saules) supinu zid Jasmanwassin Is

Here the Lord is described as free from birth, continuance and dissolution. The word sthiti (continuance) refers to the state of an object after it is created. It is understandable that the Lord is free from birth and death, but it seems wrong to say that Bhaga- vän, who is ever-existing, has no continuance. The explanation is as follows: A created object is preceded by its non-existence (prāg-abhāva). When the object is destroyed, its non-existence (pradhvamsa-abhava) again comes into being. Eternal objects, how- ever, have no non-existence, and therefore do not come into exis- tence at any particular time. It is in this sense that the Lord has no "continuance," not that He does not exist.

Brahma addresses the Lord as, "an ocean of bliss of nirvana." The significance of this is that the joy experienced through ecstatic love in devotion for the Absolute, embodying complete person- hood, replete with infinite transcendental quality, potency and 
SB 8.6.8-15 
396 
45 The Lord's Body Is Eternal and All-pervading 
characteristics, is like an ocean, in comparison to the bliss of libera- tion as mere extinction in Brahman, which is like a drop. Therefore, Dhruva Mahārāja had no interest in such nirvana bliss. He longed to dive into the ocean of bliss by engaging in hearing about the Lord and His devotees. 
Anor animne (finer than the atom) means that the Lord is infinitesimally smaller than the living being, which is itself atomic (anu) in size, because He enters within him. As such, it is very dif- ficult to know Him. Kṛṣṇa states this in Bhagavad Gitā: "Because of His subtle nature, He is difficult to know."s 
So after declaring the Lord's minuteness, Brahma, in the next breath, addresses the Lord as apariganya-dhamne, "One whose form is immeasurable." Śruti confirms this mutually-contradictory nature of the Lord, "He is smaller than the atom and greater than the greatest." 
Alternatively, mahat could here mean mahat-tattva, in which case the meaning is that the Lord is greater even than the mahat- tattva, the source of all material elements that make up the forms in this material world. 
According to Nyaya-sastra, all forms can be categorized into three sizes: atomic, medium and infinite. Medium includes molec- ular and grossly visible forms. This verse describes the Lord as both atomic and infinite in size, and we know that the Lord displayed a medium-sized body while Brahma was offering prayers. Thus, by His acintya-sakti, the Lord manifests all three sizes simultaneously. This is the significance of the word mahanubhava, or one who has great opulence. 
The Lord is worshiped by various means described in the Vedas and Tantras. In Sections 9-10 of Tattva Sandarbha, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi established that the Vedas are eternal. Since the Vedas are eternal, the Lord, whom the Vedas describe as the entity to be worshiped, must also be eternal. But here a doubt may be raised. According

gatha Śri Bhagavat Sandarbhanga 
to the above logic, the devas must also be eternal, since the Vedas describe how they too should be worshiped. In fact, the names of these gods refer to the posts they hold. The person may change, but the post remains. Even so, one may object that during the total dis- solution, the post vanishes along with the post-holder; how then can the post itself be considered eternal? The answer is that eter- nal, in regard to the gods' posts, means perpetual; though sometimes manifest and sometimes unmanifest, they recur again and again eternally. boats and wool phala 
Alternatively, the references to the devas in the Vedas can be understood to apply to the eternal associates of the Lord in Vaikun- tha who have the same names. On the other hand, since there are no worshipers during annihilation, it does not matter whether the devas exist at that time or not.

45 The Lord's Body Is Eternal and All-pervading 
In the two verses preceding the verse quoted above (i.e., SB 8.3.22- 23), the Supreme Lord was shown to be the cause of everything; therefore, He cannot simply be one among the gods. He is dis- tinct from them in that He is devoid of the gunas, like sattva, or of any of the material elements. Similarly, to say that He is nei- ther male nor female means that He is free from the correspond- ing material attributes. Thus, Gajendra said, "He is not a eunuch." Consequently, He is not "an embodied being of any kind." 
कारणभूतः सत्त्वादिगुणः पुण्यपापलक्षणं कर्म च नेत्याह - नायं गुणः कर्मेति । तयोरपि प्रवर्तकत्वादिति भावः । 
He is not the cause [of the creation] in the form of the gunas, like sattva, nor as karma, characterized by piety or sin. Thus, it is here said, "He is neither a constituent quality of nature, nor the mech- anism of action" (nayam guṇaḥ karma). The import is that He is 
their activator. 
किं बहुना ? यदत्र सत् स्थूलमसत् सूक्ष्मं तदेकमपि न भवति स्वप्रकाशरूपत्वादिति भावः । 
What more can be said? He is "neither cause (sat) nor effect (asat)," i.e., He is not any one of the subtle or gross entities of this world, the implication being that it is because He is self- luminous.

“किन्तु सर्वस्य निषेधेऽवधित्वेन शिष्यत इति शेषः । मायया तत्तदशेषात्मकश्च जयतात् मद्विमोक्षणायाविर्भवतु” इति टीका च । 
Śridhara Svāmi also comments, "But when everything is negated, He is left as the ultimate remainder (nişedha-seṣa). Through His energies, He is the complete embodiment of everything, thus He is aśeşa (unlimited). May He appear here (jayatat) for my release." Here ends Śrīdhara Svämi's comment. 
505 
"In the translation, jayatāt was rendered as, "May He be ever glorious." The verbal root vji (to be victorious) is often used in expressions of praise or blessing, but it can also mean to move or to come. Śrīdhara Svāmī has interpreted it in the latter sense, in keeping with the context of Gajendra praying for the Lord to come and save him from the crocodile.

Because Gajendra, the king of the elephants, had described the Absolute in non-specific terms, the gods, headed by Brahmā, who identify themselves with particular names and forms, did not come to his aid. At that moment, Śrī Hari, the embodiment of all the gods, appeared there, since He is the Self of them all. (SB 8.3.30) 12 
एवमुपवर्णितं निर्विशेषं देवादिरूपं विना परं तत्त्वं येन तं गजेन्द्रम् । विविधलिङ्गभिदाभि- माना विविधा चासौ लिङ्गभिदा देवादिरूपभेदश्च तस्याभिमानो येषामत एव ते ब्रह्मादयो यदा नोपजग्मुस्तत्र तदा निखिलात्मकत्वात् निखिलानां तेषां परमात्मसुखरूपत्वात् तद्वि- लक्षणो माययाशेषात्मकत्वादखिलामरमयो हरिराविरासीत् इति । 
Gajendra had “glorified the Absolute in non-specific terms,” i.e., his description of Absolute Reality had not specified any partic- ular form of God. Therefore, the gods, like Brahmā, “who iden- tify themselves with particular names and forms" (vividha-linga- bhidabhimana), i.e., who identify themselves with their various devatā forms, did not approach him. At that time, “since He is the Self of them all" (nikhilätmakatvāt), i.e., since His form is the supreme spiritual bliss of all those gods and is thus different from them, and who by His internal energy is the source of everyone's self, Śri Hari, "the embodiment of all the gods, appeared there." एवमाविर्भावं प्रार्थयमाने श्रीगजेन्द्रे यद्रूपेणाविर्भूतं तत् खलु तादृशमेव भवितुमर्हतीति साधूक्तम् “स्थूलसूक्ष्मवस्त्वतिरिक्तस्तव श्रीविग्रह” इति । अन्यथा त्वपाणिपादरूपत्वेनैव तच् चेतस्याविर्भूय तद् विदध्यात् । तदुक्तम् “स्वेच्छामयस्य” (भा० १०।१४।२) इति । 
Since this manifestation of the Lord appeared in response to the prayers of Gajendra, it follows that He fulfilled the criteria of Gajendra's description. Thus, it was appropriately stated, “Your form is different from everything subtle or gross." Were it not so, the Lord could have protected him by appearing in his mind, with- out any hands or legs. Thus, Brahma said that Kṛṣṇa is one who appears by His independent will (sveccha-mayasya, SB 10.14.2).

Commentary

dziw abo 
Although it was said in the previous section that Kṛṣṇa's form is the basis of all measurement, He is neither atomic nor infinite in size. He is absolutely free from any material limitation. This does not mean, however, that He has no form or personality. To fur- ther clarify this, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi quotes two relevant verses from Gajendra's prayers in the Eighth Canto. 
Gajendra was an elephant king who lived on the Trikūța Moun- tains in the milky ocean. One day he went to drink water in a lake when a crocodile came and caught him by the leg. Gajendra tried to release himself, but in vain. At last, bereft of any other recourse, he began to pray to the Lord.did 
The curious thing about the elephant king's prayers is that he mentions no names or personal features of the Lord. Indeed, it appears as though he were praying to unqualified Brahman. But when he had completed his prayers, it was Śrī Viṣṇu who appeared and immediately severed the crocodile's head with His discus. None of the devas came to help, because they all identify themselves with a particular name and form and therefore did not consider Gajen- dra's plea to be directed toward them. Bhagavan, however, is free from all material qualities, and yet at the same time, is the source of everything, so He came to the elephant king's rescue. 
The prayers of Gajendra reveal the real purpose of the via negativa of the Upanisads- of statements like neti neti, "not this, not this," which deny attribution of the Absolute Truth. They also clarify state- ments found in the Vedas that emphasize the unqualified nature of the Absolute, and elucidate their real meaning. For example: 
401 
galhering Śri Bhagavat Sandarbha 2 
He has no hands, yet He receives. He has no feet, yet He walks swiftly. He sees, though devoid of eyes, and He hears without ears. (śu 3.19)13 
That He has no hands, feet, eyes and ears means that He does not have material hands, feet, eyes and ears. Bhagavan has no material body. Identify

Therefore, it is said, "One should supplement the meaning of the Vedas with the Itihasa and Purana." Prabhasa-khaṇḍa of Skanda 
Purāņa states: 
O best of the twice born, I consider the meaning and importance of the Puranas to be as firm as that of the Vedas. Without doubt, theat entire subject matter of the Vedas exists in them. The Vedas fear per-sta sons of petty knowledge, thinking they will pervert their meaning; on motherefore, in the past the meaning of the Vedas was confirmed by 
means of the Itihāsas and Purānas. What is not found in the Vedas is found in Smrti, but what is not found in either of these is found in the Purāņas. A person is not considered learned if he does not know the Purānas, even if he has studied the four Vedas along with the Vedangas and Upanisads. (Skanda Purana 5.3.121) 155 
Some scholars do not consider the Itihāsas and Pūrāṇas authentic and say that their philosophical conclusions are defective. It would be very difficult to understand Absolute Reality without the help of the Purānas, among which Śrimad Bhagavatam is supreme. Har bayThe prayers recited by Gajendra are apparently directed toward the Absolute as unqualified. Yet, immediately following these

prayers, the qualified Absolute (i.e., Bhagavan) came to his rescue, appearing directly before him. This apparent incongruity com- pletely decries the radically unqualified interpretation of the Vedic statements. If the import of his non-descript prayers were that the Absolute is formless and unqualified, there would have been no need for the personal Lord to come to his aid. He should have manifested as unqualified Brahman in Gajendra's heart and made him under- stand that He is Brahman, just as the crocodile was Brahman, and that there was thus no death for him. 
Śrī Kṛṣṇa says that He reveals Himself to all who surrender unto Him, exactly in accordance with the essential nature of their sur- render (GĪTĀ 4.11). This means that although Gajendra used non- descript words (i.e., without reference to form or quality), He had a person in mind. 
The words nisedha-seșa and aśeșa in the first of the two verses under discussion are significant. Nişedha-seșa means that when everything is denied by the process of elimination (i.e., neti neti), Bhagavan is all that remains (sesa). Alternatively, it could mean that after everything is annihilated, Bhagavan alone remains16 Aśeşa means that the Lord is the embodiment of everything. He is non- dual consciousness, advaya-jñāna. Nothing can exist without Him. The idea is that God is both distinct from everything and yet the embodiment of everything. He thus cannot be said to be gross or subtle, masculine or feminine, nor even cause or effect. 
According to modern bio-medical science, a baby's gender depends on the chromosome structure in the sperm cells. An xx combination of the 23rd chromosome from the father and mother produces a child of female gender, and an xy combination, of male gender. Since the Lord is not material and, moreover, not born through the combination of a male and female, He is said to be neither male nor female. By the same logic, He is also not a hermaphrodite. He is neither human, nor animal. 
All action in the material world is caused by the gunas of material nature - prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāņi sarvaśaḥ (GĪTĀ 3.27). Both sinful and pious acts are conducted under the influence of the 
16 See SB 10.3.25 discussed in Section 29. 
403 
gbang Śrī Bhagavat Sandarbhad sill 
gunas. The Lord is neither the gunas nor their effect, in the form of action. Although the Lord is none of these, He is still a person. This is the significance of niṣedha-seṣa. The denial is of all material quali- ties, not of the transcendental qualities and potency inherent in the personal nondual Absolute.pro brebeslamotel subdi 
Therefore, Śrī Brahma says that Bhagavan is supremely inde- pendent and appears according to His own sweet will, svecchamaya (SB 10.14.2). 
The verses Gajendra spoke should not be misinterpreted to indi- cate unqualified Brahman, because this would openly contradict Gajendra's vision of the Lord as a person:

berThough in great pain due to being in the grip of the mighty crocodile within the water, Gajendra, upon seeing Śrī Hari in the sky, mounted Garuda with His disc raised, held up a lotus in his trunk and with great difficulty uttered the words, "O Śrī Nārāyaṇa, teacher of the universe, my obeisances unto You." (SB 8.3.32) 
In the next anuccheda, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi will explain that though the Lord's form is not material, it can be seen by devotees.

Śrīdhara Svāmi comments: "[King Nrga said,] 'O Lord! You who are all-pervading have become visible to my eyes and are being directly perceived by me. This is most astonishing!' What is so surprising about that? 'You are the Transcendent Self (Parātmā); therefore, even the masters of yoga (yogeśvaras) contemplate, i.e., meditate, upon You in their pure hearts, through the eye of the Upanisads. The reason why they adopt such means is that You are Adhokṣaja, unapproachable by sense perception, i.e., You are situated beyond the knowledge gained through the senses. Only those who are free from material bondage should be able to see You. Owing to the material misery of this lizard body, my intel- lect has been blinded; thus, Your appearance before me is highly surprising."

I have created this illusion, and therefore, you think that you can see Me because the qualities I have are all eto material. But this conception is incorrect. (MB 12.339.45-46)6

Naśyeya (I could be destroyed) here means, "I could become invisible." To show the reason behind His independence and distinction from the material world, Bhagavan then says, "I am the Supreme Controller and the Spiritual Teacher of the entire universe. Still, if you think Me to possess material qualities, or if you believe Me to be connected to these qualities, then this is an illusion of My creation." In other words, "This is appearance only, due to My illusion or mayä." Therefore, the Lord says, "This conception is incorrect."

JAMO Bṛhaspati, neither you nor we can see the Lord at our will. Only Gd those whom He favors can see Him. (MB 12.336.20) 
तदेवं श्रुतावप्यदृश्यत्वादयो धर्माः श्रीविग्रहस्यैवोक्ताः । श्रुत्यन्तरं च “न चक्षुषा पश्यति रूपमस्य" (कठ २।३।९) इति ॥ नृगः श्रीभगवन्तम् ॥ 
Therefore, the qualities of Bhagavan, such as invisibility, men- tioned in the Vedic texts, belong to His body and not to anything else. One such Vedic statement is, "The eye cannot see His form" (KU 2.3.9).10 
Commentary 
ŚRILA JIVA GOSVĀMĪ HAS ESTABLISHED that the Lord's form is one, eternal, transcendental, and all-pervading. In the last anuccheda he discussed Gajendra's prayers, which describe the Absolute appar- ently as formless and without attributes. In reality, these prayers demonstrate that the Absolute is not devoid of qualities as such, but of material qualities. The proof is that the Absolute Truth appeared to Gajendra as a transcendental person, Śrī Nārāyaṇa. 
A doubt may be raised here: The eyes and other senses of all material beings are material and can only perceive material objects. Indeed, Brahmă designed the senses in that way, as stated in Katha Upanisad: 
The self-born Śrī Brahma created the senses to perceive external gobjects, and therefore, one sees them, but not the indwelling self. 
(KU 2.1.1)" raftoolsdi moda mild and 
According to this rationale, if Gajendra saw Śrī Viṣṇu, then His body must be material. Moreover, if He is all-pervading, He cannot be visible, and vice versa. According to logic and experience, objects that are either all-pervading or atomic in size cannot be seen.

Na In response to these doubts, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi explains that although the form of the Lord is within (pratyag-ātmā), it can be made visible by His mercy. To this end, he cites a verse by King Nrga, the son of King Iksvaku of the Sun Dynasty. 
Nrga was a very munificent person. He was especially fond of donating cows to the brahmanas. Once, a cow he had donated to a brāhmaṇa escaped from its recipient and came back to the king's fold. Unwittingly considering it to be his own, King Nrga gave it again to another brāhmaṇa in charity. When the second brāhmaṇa was taking the cow away, the first brāhmaṇa claimed it. A quarrel ensued and they approached the king to settle the matter. 
King Nrga humbly admitted his mistake and offered to give more cows to the brahmana if he would relinquish his claim on the dis- puted one. Both were adamant, however, and each considered it improper to disown the cow. To pacify them, King Nrga offered each of them a hundred thousand cows, but they both declined and went away in anger, leaving the cow with him. Owing to this mistake, though unintentional, King Nrga was obliged to take birth as a lizard in his next life. 
One day, while they were playing in the forest near Dvārakā, Kṛṣṇa's sons felt thirsty and went to a well for water. Upon looking inside, they saw that it was dry and that a gigantic lizard was trapped there. Out of compassion, they tried to pull it out. Being unsuc- cessful, they appealed to Kṛṣṇa, who came to the well and immedi- ately lifted the lizard out with His left hand. Upon being touched by Kṛṣṇa's sacred fingers, the lizard turned into a heavenly being, and Śrī Kṛṣṇa inquired from him about the details regarding his curi- ous condition. King Nrga then told his story and afterwards offered prayers to Kṛṣṇa. 
In this verse, Nrga expresses surprise that he is able to see the Supreme Lord at all. He addresses the Lord as vibhu, all-pervading, and Parātmā, or Supreme Self. Both of these epithets imply that the Lord is imperceptible by the material senses. Parātmā signifies that He is beyond the self, and, since the self cannot be seen, how is it pos- sible to see the Supreme Immanent Self? Great yogis, like the Kuma- ras, meditate on Him within the heart (hṛdi vibhavyah), which means 
41046 Though Invisible, the Lord's Body Can Be Seen by His Mercy 
that even they do not actually see Him externally. In the same verse, Nrga specifically addresses Kṛṣṇa as adhokṣaja, one who cannot be perceived by the senses. King Nrga's prayers not only establish the Lord as imperceptible, but are an admission of his own disqualifica- tion-blindness, owing to ignorance (uru-vyavasanandha-buddheḥ). Thus, it is not possible to see the Lord, whether due to the incapac- ity of the seer or to the transcendence of the Seen. The conclusion is that the Lord is neither material nor subject to material perception. And yet Nrga saw Him. How was this possible? 
The answer is that one is able to see Bhagavan only by His mercy, which is to say by His own self-willed power of self-manifestation. This will be discussed in great detail in Bhakti Sandarbha. The gist is that a living being in material life is like a drowning person. He can shout for help, but his cries cannot oblige a passerby, no matter how expert a swimmer, to come to his rescue. The mercy of the rescuer is the sole impetus for the rescue. Similarly, no process can force the Lord to manifest Himself before the devotee. He appears only by His will, being impelled by His mercy. 
vino 
bo Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi quotes from the Upanisads and Mahābhārata to confirm this. Once Narada went to Svetadvipa to meet the Lord and offered prayers by reciting two hundred different names. The Lord appeared before Narada Muni and spoke about the twenty-four material elements, the living entity, and Himself. By instructing Narada in this way, He warned that just because His body is mani- fest, one should not think it is material (MB 12.339.45-46). 
The tendency in the conditioned state is to take things for granted. We take our environment, the sunlight, the air we breathe, the water we drink, the earth we use to grow food, and so on, without ever stopping to think who created them. This is due to ignorance. Similarly, if one thinks of Bhagavan's body as material, he is under the influence of maya, or illusion. Māyā has various meanings, including "illusion" and "cheating." Although the Lord is beyond sense perception, He can be seen and understood by His grace. The Lord made a similar statement to Nārada: 
411 
Yale Śri Bhagavat Sandarbha Sp 
They [the sages Ekata, Dvita and Trita] could not see Me. No one ari but My pure devotees can see Me, and as you are the best among My ada unalloyed devotees, you are able to see Me. (MB 12.339.13) 12 
Śrī Kṛṣṇa confirms this in Uddhava-gītā: 
ROCI, who am the Supreme Immanent Self (Paramātmā) and the most Riebeloved of all (priya), am attainable for those established in truth 
(satam) only through unalloyed devotion undertaken with full faith. Moreover, bhakti performed with exclusive fixity upon Me purifies even the outcaste dog-eaters. (SB 11.14.21)13 
Therefore, although the Lord's form is pratyak-rupa, transcen- dental to the mundane senses, by His mercy He can be seen. For this reason, it is possible that He may become visible even just to a single person in an assembly, as happened in the sacrificial arena of King 
Vasu. 
Once King Uparicara Vasu was performing a horse sacrifice for the pleasure of Śrī Vişņu, and his priests were the sage Bṛhaspati and his three sons named Ekata, Dvita and Trita. The Lord was pleased with the king and appeared to him in the sacrificial area, but only he was able to see Him. Even the chief priest Bṛhaspati was unable to see the Lord and felt very frustrated. The king and other assem- bly members had to pacify Bṛhaspati by explaining that the Lord can be seen only by His supreme will. Therefore, imperceptibility is a characteristic of His body. 
Similarly, His body also possesses other attributes, described by Gajendra in the prayers cited in the previous anuccheda. 
In the following anuccheda Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi will explain that Bhagavan is without birth, action, name, form, qualities and so on, specifically in the manner that all of these are generally conceived through conventional experience, rooted in dualism.

HAVING ESTABLISHED that Bhagavan's forms are not material, we will now discuss how other features related to Him are similarly not material: 
TH 
न विद्यते यस्य च जन्म कर्म वा न नामरूपे गुणदोष एव वा । 
तथापि लोकाप्ययसम्भवाय यः स्वमायया तान्यनुकालमृच्छति ॥। १७९ ।। 
Bhagavan has no birth, action, name, form, virtues or vices. However, for the purpose of creating and destroying this mate- rial world, He accepts these perpetually by His internal potency. (SB 8.3.8)1 
अयमर्थः– अवस्थान्तरप्राप्तिर्विकारः । तत्र प्रथमविकारो जन्म इति । अपूर्णस्य निजपूर्त्य- र्था चेष्टा कर्म इति । मनोग्राह्यस्य वस्तुनो व्यवहारार्थं केनापि सङ्केतितः शब्दः नाम इति । चक्षुषा ग्राह्यो गुणः रूपम् इति । सत्त्वादिप्राकृतगुणनिदानो द्रव्यस्योत्कर्षहेतुर्धर्मविशेषो गुण इति प्रकृतिजे लोके दृश्यते । 
The meaning of the verse is as follows: A change of state is called a transformation (vikära). In the body, the first such transfor- mation is called birth (janma). The effort an incomplete person makes to compensate for what is lacking is called action (karma). 
na vidyate yasya ca janma karma va na nama-rüpe guna-dosa eva vā tathāpi lokāpyaya-sambhavaya yaḥ sva-mayaya täny anukalam ṛcchati 
413 
Śri Bhagavat Sandarbha 
The verbal symbol used to designate objects perceptible to the mind is called a name (nama). The property of an object that is perceived by the eyes is called form or color (rupa). The specify- ing characteristic that grants eminence to any object and which springs from the material gunas, like sattva, is called a quality (guna). These definitions are applicable in the world born of material nature. 
यस्य च सर्वदा स्वरूपस्थत्वात् पूर्णत्वान् मनसोऽप्यगोचरत्वात् स्वप्रकाशत्वात् प्रकृत्यती- त्वात् तानि न विद्यन्ते तथापि यस्तानि ऋच्छति प्राप्नोति “ तस्मै नमः” (भा० ८।३।९) इत्यु- त्तरश्लोकेनान्वयः । 
These [birth, name, etc.] do not exist in one [i.e., Bhagavan] who is always situated in His own nature, who is complete, imper- ceptible even by the mind, self-luminous and beyond material nature. Nevertheless, He accepts them (rcchati). This verse is to be read together with the one that follows, "my obeisances are unto Him" (tasmai namaḥ, SB 8.3.9). 
अत एव श्रुत्यापि " निष्कलं निष्क्रियं शान्तम्” (श्वे० ६।१९) इत्यादौ " अशब्दमस्पर्शमरूप- मव्ययम्” (कठ १।३।१५) इत्यादौ च तन्निषिध्यापि "सर्वकर्मा सर्वकामः सर्वगन्धः सर्वरसः” (छा० ३ ।१४।२) इत्यादौ विधीयते । गुणदोष इत्यपरमार्थत्वाद् गुण एव दोष इत्यर्थः । ततो रूढदोषस्तु सर्वथा न सम्भवत्येवेति व्यज्यते ।

Therefore, although these qualities are denied in Vedic state- ments such as, "He is undivided, inert and peaceful" (su 6.19), and, "He is imperishable; He cannot be perceived by the eyes, ears, or sense of touch" (KU 1.3.15), they are accepted in other mantras such as, "He performs all acts, possesses all desires, and has all fragrance and taste" (CHU 3.14.2). The compound word guna-dosa (lit., "virtue and defect") [in the verse under discus- sion] means that material virtues (guna), are considered defects (dosa) in the transcendental Lord. This implies that conventional defects certainly do not exist in Him. (hinolaryolard

Because the Lord is endowed with His supreme magnificence, He is called viruddhartha, or one who has contradictory qualities. But although all opposing qualities exist in Him, one should never assume Him to have defects. All the virtues, even contradictory bones, exist in Him." 
“अयमात्मापहतपाप्मा” ( छा० ८।७।१) इत्याद्याः श्रुतयश्च । छा० ४।१५। २-४-

अत एव सर्वगन्धः इत्यादौ गन्धादिशब्देन सौगन्धादिकमेवोच्यते । 
Therefore, words such as gandha (smell) in phrases like, "He has all fragrance" [sarva-gandha in the Chandogya passage quoted above], should be taken to mean only pleasant fragrances, and so 
on. 
यदा तु ऋच्छतिनान्वयस्तु गुणस्य दोषत्वेन रूपकमविवक्षितं श्रुतिविरुद्धत्वात् परमार्थत्वे- नैव प्रतिपादयिष्यमाणत्वाच् च । 
adorfw.an 
absol When the verb rcchati (acquires ) [ in the original verse, sB 8.3.8], is linked to its subject, the Lord, then the word guna (attributes ) cannot refer to defects [as was done above], because that would contradict the Vedic statements, and because it will be established that any such attributes are transcendental. 
नन्वेकत्र तेषां जन्मादीनां भावाभावयोर्विरोध इत्याशङ्क्य तदविरोधे हेतुमाह - स्वमाय- येति । अन्यथानुपपत्तिप्रमिता दुस्तर्क्या स्वरूपशक्तिरेव तत्र हेतुः । 
Intuiting that the simultaneous existence and non-existence of the Lord's qualities, birth and action would be thought contradic- tory, Gajendra provides the reason for their congruency in the phrase, “by His internal potency” ( sva-māyayā). The only cause for this is His internal potency, which surpasses all logic and can be understood only by means of presumption. 
अत एव स्वरूपभूतत्वेन तेभ्यः प्राकृतेभ्यो विलक्षणत्वात् तान्यपि न विद्यन्त इति च वक्तुं न शक्यत इति भावः । 
The import is that because Bhagavan's actions of birth, and so on, spring from His essential nature and are thus diametrically opposed to their material counterparts, one cannot say that these names, actions and so on, do not exist in Him. 
यथा शङ्करशारीरके “समाकर्षात्” (ब्र० सू० १।४।१६) इत्यत्र “नामरूपव्याकृतवस्तुविषयः स्वच्छन्दः प्रायेण प्रसिद्ध इति तद्व्यकरणाभावापेक्षया प्रागुत्पत्तेः सदेव ब्रह्म श्रुतावसदित्यु- च्यते” इत्युक्तं तथैव ज्ञेयम् ।

Any other explanation of the word maya would negate the ear- lier statements and contradict the transcendental experience of the speaker of Srimad Bhagavatam [Sukadeva], who, "had been immersed in transcendental bliss" (SB 12.12.68). So, sva-mayaya always means, "by His cit, or conscious potency." Therefore, Śrīdhara Svāmi has also explained the word yoga-māyā as cit, or conscious potency [Bhāvārtha-dipikā 3.15.26]. 
ननु प्राप्नोतीत्युक्तेः कदाचित्कत्वमप्यवगम्यते ? तत्राह - अनुकालं नित्यमेव प्राप्नोति कदाचिदपि न त्यजतीत्यर्थः । स्वरूपशक्तिप्रकाशित्वस्य नित्यत्वस्य च मिथो हेतुहेतुमत्ता ज्ञेया । 
A doubt is raised: The word rcchati (he attains) implies that the Lord's qualities are temporary. In answer, the verse says, anukālam, "[He attains them] perpetually," meaning that He is never bereft of them. It should be understood that there is a rela- tionship of cause and effect between the actions manifested by the internal energy and their eternal nature.

EVEN THOUGH THE SUPREME LORD'S NAME can be vibrated on the tongue, His form can be seen by His devotees, and though He engages in action, like protecting His devotees, His name, form and action are not material. To establish this principle, Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī refers once again to the prayers of Gajendra from the Eighth Canto. 
In this verse, Gajendra says that the Lord does not have name, form, good qualities or defects, nor does He take birth or engage in action, though He accepts all these perpetually through His māyā. This seems contradictory and thus requires explanation; Gajendra's statement means that the Lord does not possess these qualities in the conventional sense. 
The mortal body undergoes six types of vikara, or transformation, "The body takes birth, subsists for some time, grows, ages, dwindles and finally dies" (jayate'sti vardhate vipariņamate apakṣiyate nasyati ca, Nirukta 1.1.2). Transformation means a change of state or an irre- versible change. Birth is considered to be the first transformation. The body is composed of different material elements, which combine together to form a material body, in accordance with the destiny of a particular self. The definition of birth may vary in regard to differ- ent species of life, but in this anuccheda the reference is to human birth. 
апоз 
According to the sage Vatsyayana, the principal commentator on Nyaya-sutra, the appearance of the body, senses and cognitive awareness in a single conglomeration is called birth - (śārīrendriya- buddhīnāṁ nikaya-visiṣṭa prädurbhavaḥ, Vätsyāyana-bhāṣya 1.1.2). This means that the moment of the living being's emergence from the womb, as a unit, consisting of body, senses and mind, is called birth. In this conglomeration, referred to as the jiva, or the condi- tioned being, the gross body is more temporary than the senses or mind, which are part of the subtle body. The gross body is destroyed at the time of death, but the mind and senses are carried over to the next life. This is confirmed by Śrī Kṛṣṇa: 
42047 His Name, Form, Actions and Attributes Are Transcendental 
When the master of the body [the self] leaves it to take another, heq carries the senses and mind with him to the next body, just as the airl br carries an aroma. (GĪTĀ 15.8)20 
bos menn 
ei rovswan bre 
The eyes, ears, nose and so on, of a dead body are not actually the senses, but just their respective seats. The senses are subtle; though residing within the gross body, they are beyond sense perception. Since the Lord never leaves His body, there is no possibility for Him to take birth in the conventional sense.

Karma here refers to the endeavor undertaken in order to fulfill one's desires. The Lord is free from such karma, because He never has any material desire to fulfill. If He did, He could not justifiably be called, "Lord." Therefore, He is free from karma. 
According to the Mīmāmsakas, whose classifications are rele- vant in this context, karma is of three types - nitya, naimittika and kamya. Nitya-karma refers to those prescribed duties which must be performed, otherwise one is implicated in sin. An example is the chanting of Gayatri mantra at dawn and dusk by the dvijas, or twice- born. Duties prescribed for special occasions, such as solar eclipses, are called naimittika, or incidental. Such occasions are irregular; hence, naimittika-karmas are also irregular. Activities prescribed in order to fulfill specific desires are called kamya. 
The Supreme Lord makes the rules, yet He is beyond them. He has no mundane desires to fulfill and thus no karma to perform. Śrī Krsna explains this to Arjuna: be no lo que os no no 
ons Em 
O Arjuna, in the three worlds I have no duties (karma) to execute. I have nothing unattained to achieve, yet I am ever-engaged in action. (GĪTĀ 3.22)21

In the material world, every object or phenomenon has a name that acts as a signifier for it. A name serves two purposes: First, it allows us to differentiate one object from another; and second, it

Śrī Bhagavat Sandarbha rom 
provides us with a means to refer to and conceptualize that partic- ular object or phenomenon. Those objects or phenomena that have names are perceived, either directly or indirectly, through the mind and senses. The Lord, however, is beyond the scope of the senses and mind. Therefore, Gajendra says that He has no material names. 
The attribute perceived by the eyes is called form or color (rupa). This definition is applicable only to gross forms, for microscopic objects, like atoms, also have form. Our eyes cannot see the air, which is formless. The Lord too is not visible to us, but that does not mean that He is formless, like the air. The Lord cannot be seen with material eyes because He has a transcendental form. 
The distinctiveness of an object is manifest by the gunas of mate- rial nature, but since the Lord is transcendental to the gunas, He is without material attributes. 
In this way, it can be understood that the Lord does not have birth, names, forms, action or any qualities as conventionally conceived. This means that His birth and action are not material, nor are His name, form and qualities. He is always in His svarupa; therefore, He has no birth. He is always complete in Himself, so there is no need to perform action. He cannot be perceived by the mind, and thus, He has no name. He is self-luminous, and therefore, the perception of His form is in no way dependent on material eyes. 
This is the purport of the first half of the verse spoken by Gajen- dra. The second half states that the Lord accepts name, form and so on, for the purposes of creation and destruction. This is a reference to His guṇāvatāras, Śrī Brahma and Lord Siva, respectively. Gajen- dra does not say, however, that the Lord accepts birth, name and so on, for the purpose of maintenance in His manifestation as Visņu. This is because Visnu is not limited by māyā, even though He con- ducts the function of regulating sattva-guna, and thus maintaining māyā. and other ro 
Hence, the Supreme Person's birth as the son of Devaki and Vasudeva, His act of lifting Govardhan Hill, His name Kṛṣṇa, His form as a cowherd boy, His quality of beauty, and even His defects, such as disobedience to His mother when breaking the yogurt pot, are all transcendental. 
422 
47 His Name, Form, Actions and Attributes Are Transcendental 
The words sambhava (creation) and apyaya (destruction) can also refer to protecting the devotees and destroying the asuras. Although Bhagavan is free from birth, karma and so on, by His inter- nal potency He accepts them for this purpose. This is confirmed in Bhagavad Gita:top 
el 
Although I am never born and My body never perishes, and though I am the controller of all living beings, situated in My own nature, I appear by My own will. (GITA 4.6) 22 
I appear in every yuga to protect the sages, to destroy the rogues, and to establish order in society. (GITA 4.8) 23 
The Vedas declare that the Lord has no name, form or action, but they also state that He performs all action, and has all names and desires. The Vedas are apauruşeya, without human origin, which is to say, they are infallible and therefore cannot be wrong. The Lord has been shown to be transcendental to material nature, so these negative descriptions must be interpreted to mean that He has no material name, form and so on. 
BIf an Italian visits Vṛndāvana and upon returning to Italy reports that there was nothing to eat in Vṛndāvana (in other words, no tra- ditional Italian food), a compatriot may wrongly conclude that the people in Vṛndāvana are starving. Or, if a ship in the middle of the ocean runs out of drinking water and the captain declares there is no water, he means drinking water, for otherwise there is water all around. 
Jadwavelg 
In the Vedic scriptures, both material and spiritual birth, name, form and so on, are referred to by the same terms, and this can mislead those unacquainted with the esoteric knowledge of tran- scendence. If these statements are studied in the proper light, how- ever, one will understand that there is no contradiction. More- over, Bhagavan is uniquely and inherently endowed with mutually contradictory attributes.q5os val

Śrī Bhagavat Sandarbha m 
The compound word guna-dosa in the principal verse of this sec- tion implies that the Lord has no material attributes, since whatever good qualities may exist on the material plane ultimately reinforce dualism. Hence, they are regarded as defects, or in other words, impositions on spirit, from the spiritual standpoint. The absence of material qualities or defects is confirmed in the verse quoted from Kurma Purana and the mantra from Chandogya Upanisad. The 
fisd gaivil complete mantra states: 
He has no sin, no old age, no death, no sorrow, no hunger and no thirst; but His desires are always fulfilled and His will never fails. (CHU 8.7.1)24 
tud noi 
BnThus, when it is said that Bhagavan has all odors, sarva-gandha (CHU 3.14.2), it means He has all fragrances and not foul odors. The same is to be understood about other qualities, such as taste and touch. 
Б 
on An objection may be raised here: In the first half of the verse, Gajendra said that the Lord has no attributes or defects, guna-dosa. In the second half, however, he said, anukalam ṛcchati, that the Lord, "accepts them perpetually," implying that He also accepts defects. In response, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī says that the Lord is transcendental to the material gunas and thus there is no possibility of Him accept- ing any material quality, good or bad. In His pastimes in the mate- rial world, however, Bhagavan behaves like a human being and dis- plays what appear to be defects from the material viewpoint. But, as already stated, there can be no material defects in Him. Vsi n 
This is the import of the word sva-mayaya (by His internal potency). This word should not be interpreted here to mean illu- sory energy, because that external māyā cannot influence Him. By dint of His internal potency, however, He performs human-like pas- times, though He is not an ordinary human being. Narada confirms this in his prayers: "Now You have accepted a human form for Your pastimes” (krīḍārtham abhyātta-manuṣya-vigraham, SB 10.37.24).

47 His Name, Form, Actions and Attributes Are Transcendental 
If Bhagavan's pastimes and attributes were mere manifestations of māyā, a liberated being, like Sukadeva, would not have been attracted to them. He was an ätmäräma, a sage delighting in the self alone, and yet he gave up his absorption in Brahman upon hearing the Lord's pastimes. He would do so only because Bhagavan's name, form, qualities and action are without tinge of the mundane: 
minniped garved do 
dess 
I bow down to the son of Vyasa, who, though fully situated in his own bliss and, consequently, completely free of any conception of duality, became attracted in his very essence by the enchanting pas- Ptimes of the invincible Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Then, out of compassion for all, 
he expanded the Lord's own Purana, which spreads the light of sup- reme truth and destroys all sins. (SB 12.12.68) 25 
枝 
Although it is said that the Lord accepts birth and so on, which would imply that they are temporary, the verse counters this by say- ing that He accepts them perpetually (anukalam). According to the rules of Sanskrit grammar, the present tense (rcchati) implies eter- nality. The Supreme Lord is eternal and His pastimes are also eter- nal, because they are manifestations of His svarupa-sakti, or essen- tial nature, which is inseparable from Him. This is the significance of the phrase anukalam ṛcchati. 
According to modern physics, energy means the capacity to per- form work. There is pleasure in possessing energy, but that pleasure increases considerably when energy is put into action. An energetic person does not feel complete if restricted from application of his power. Bhagavan has natural potencies that eternally reside within Him. There is nothing that can restrict His will, and therefore, He eternally performs pastimes. So, all His actions are eternal and tran- scendental in nature.

Another doubt is raised: How can anyone's birth and actions be eternal? Both are actions, and every action consists of various parts, each having a beginning and an end; otherwise, it cannot be designated as an action.

Answer: This is not an issue, since within the Lord there are eter- nally unlimited forms, unlimited prakāśa manifestations, unlim- ited pastimes of birth and other activities. There are also unlim- ited individual manifestations of suitable places for these pas- times to occur, and unlimited associates to participate in these pastimes, both in the unlimited material worlds and unlimited Vaikunthas. This being the case, the beginning and end parts of the birth and actions of one particular form may or may not have ended in one place in a particular prakāśa, while the same parts of those births and actions are just beginning in other places in other prakāśa manifestations. Thus, because Bhagavan's birth and actions never cease beginning and ending, they exist in Him eternally.sh

either having the same set of qualifiers or not. One form can per- form different actions in different prakāśa manifestations. This has already been established in the explanation of the verse, "It is amazing that Kṛṣṇa has alone, in a single body, been able to simultaneously marry 16,000 wives, each in their own separate palaces" (SB 10.69.2).26 Because of differences in their activities, there can also be a difference in the sense of identity (abhimana) of the different prakāśa manifestations that perform them. This being the case, a different sense of aesthetic relish (rasa) is awak- ened in each prakāśa as a result of the particular sequence of pastimes in the different places. 
ननु कथं ते एव जन्मकर्मणी वर्तेते इत्युक्तं पृथगारब्धत्वादन्ये एव ते ? 
A further doubt is raised: Why was it said that these births and actions are one? Since they begin in different times and places, shouldn't they be counted as different? 
उच्यते - कालभेदेनोदितानामपि समानरूपाणां क्रियाणामेकत्वम् । यथा शङ्करशारीरके “द्विर्गोशब्दोऽयमुच्चरितः । न तु द्वौ गोशब्दाविति । तथैव द्विः पाकः कृतोऽनेन न तु द्विधा पाकः कृतोऽनेनेति प्रतीत्या भविष्यति” इति । ततो जन्मकर्मणोरपि नित्यता युक्तैव । अत एवागमादावपि भूतपूर्वलीलोपासनविधानं युक्तम् । 
M 
In response, it is said that the actions performed in different time frames are considered as one if they have the same form. As Sankarācārya says in his commentary on Vedanta-sutra, "If the word 'cow' is uttered twice ('cow, cow'), the understanding is that the same word has been uttered twice, not that two differ- ent words have been spoken."2" Similarly, when we say, "twice- cooked," we mean that the same item has been cooked twice, not that two different things have been cooked. So it is proper to say that Bhagavan's birth and actions are eternal, and thus the injunction in the Agamas to worship the Lord's previous pastimes is appropriate.

To prove the veracity of the words of His servant, Prahlada Mahā- rāja, that He is present in all objects, the Supreme Lord Hari appeared from the pillar of the royal court in a wonderful form, never before seen, that was neither that of a man nor of a lion. (SB 7.8.18)32

In the narration of Sri Kapiladeva's appearance, the following passage is found: "The Lord took shelter of the semen (virya) of the sage Kardama" (SB 3.24.6).33 This should be explained to mean that the Lord came under the powerful influence (virya) of Kar- dama's bhakti. The word virya has the well-known secondary meaning of "son," which is also intended. Similarly, what dis- tinguishes the Lord's actions from ordinary acts is that they are exclusively manifestations of His natural bliss. As Brahma-sūtra states, "The actions of the Lord, such as creation, are a play, like the pleasurable deeds people enact" (vs 2.1.33).34 The Tattvavādī [Madhvācārya] has explained this sutra, "The Lord creates in the same way that an intoxicated man dances out of bliss, and not to achieve anything."35

By the example of a dancing madman [implying impairment or absence of awareness], one should not think that the Lord is some- thing other than omniscient. The example is relevant in this sense alone, that, owing to His excessive internal bliss, He per- forms pastimes without having any particular purpose to accom- plish. If to try and circumvent the problem with this example, we posit instead the example of [the Lord's pastimes occurring nat- urally, like] inhaling and exhaling, the same defect [absence of awareness being attributed to the Lord] still presents itself, in the case of breathing during deep sleep. Therefore, the limita- tions of these examples aside, the real point to be noted is that Bhagavan's pastimes are characterized exclusively as natural and spontaneous manifestations of the bliss inherent in His essential nature. Śruti also declares, "This [i.e., the act of creation, etc.] is the nature of the Lord. What yearning can there be in one whose desires are naturally and completely fulfilled" (Mandukya- kärikā 1.9)?38

If the Lord's direct engagements, such as the act of glancing at material nature, are accepted as His pastimes, then the deeds He performs in Vaikuntha are surely all the more so. The wives of the Kaliya serpent prayed, "Our obeisances unto You, who always enjoy in Your own nature” (avyākrta-vihārāya, SB 10.16.47).

nature. Additionally, the verses state that one attains the wealth of one's true nature on being freed from material bondage. Thus, the wise referred to in the above verse are precisely such lib- erated sages, who delight in the Self alone (ātmārāma). It is they who describe the births and actions of the Lord of the Heart, Paramātmā. 
तत्तत्प्रतिषेधे तदुपरतौ चैव सत्यां तज्जन्मकर्मानुभवसम्पत्ती भवत इत्यर्थः । सम्पत्तिर- त्र साक्षाद् दर्शनम् । तस्मात् स्वरूपानन्दातिशयितभगवदानन्दविलासरूपाण्येव तानीति भावः । अत एव प्राकृतवैलक्षण्यात् “अकर्तुरजनस्य” इत्युक्तम् । अत एव वेदगुह्यान्यपि तानीति । 
In other words, only when one becomes free from false identifi- cation with the gross and subtle bodies, and from material con- ditioning in general, does one attain the riches in the form of direct experience of the Lord's birth and acts. The word sampatti (riches) here means direct witnessing (sākṣād-darśana). There- fore, the underlying intent is to say that the births and actions of the Lord are manifestations of His bliss as the complete nondual Whole, Bhagavan (bhagavad-ananda), which exceeds that coming from His state of simple inherence in essential being (svarūpā- nanda). For this reason, it was said of the Lord that He is inactive (akarta) and unborn (ajana), in order to distinguish His birth and actions from their material counterparts. Thus, they are "hidden to the Vedas."

Commentary 
Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī raises a doubt about Bhagavan's birth and pas- times: How can they be eternal? By definition, an action must have a beginning and an end. Every act has a purpose and concludes when that purpose is fulfilled. Generally, one activity involves other sup- porting actions. For example, if a boy, let's say, Kṛṣṇa Dāsa, writes, his action of writing involves holding his pen, lifting his hand, look- ing at the paper, thinking, and so on. All these related actions have a beginning and an end. Since the actions even of the Supreme Lord, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, seem to bear the same characteristics, how can it be said that they are eternal? His birth, for example, has a beginning and an

end, so how can His birth be eternal? If somehow we suppose that it is eternal, then all the pastimes that occur after birth should be impossible. 
slimi? batsupt 
erŚrīla Jiva Gosvāmī raises this objection with the goal of strength- ening his thesis that Krsna's actions are eternal. This is called sthūņa- nikhanana-nyaya, or "the principle of driving in a post." As a post is driven into the ground by repeated hammering, so a philosophical conclusion (siddhanta) is strengthened by supplying more and more supporting arguments, until no reasonable doubts remain. 
In response to this objection, Śrī Jīva Prabhu restates that the Lord is not limited by time and space. He is one, yet He manifests an unlimited number of prakāśa's forms, abodes and associates. These are the three things He needs to conduct His pastimes. Hence, He is fully equipped to continuously manifest His pastimes in count- less material universes, as well as in the unlimited spiritual worlds. When a particular activity, like birth, comes to end in one particu- lar universe, it instantly begins in another. Thus, there is never a moment when His pastime of birth is not occurring somewhere in the creation. In fact, the activity may have begun in one place before it comes to an end in another. 
nar A practical example is the sun, which appears to rise at a particu- lar time in a particular place, yet at the same time it is always rising in some part of the world. Indeed, at any given moment, the sun manifests its full range of positions in the firmament - it is always rising somewhere, it is always noon somewhere, and it is always set- ting somewhere on the planet. If this is possible for a material heav- enly body, then it is certainly possible for the transcendental Lord, for whom nothing is impossible. 
A further objection may be raised: The Lord's actions in different universes are different from each other, being separated by time and space. Why then should these actions be counted as one? Since they are different, it would be incorrect to say that His pastime of birth is eternal. It would be more accurate to say that He keeps repeating 
45 Prakāśa manifestations are nondifferent from the original, yet can function 
independently. See the definition from Laghu-bhāgavatamṛta given at the end of Section 42. 
434 
47 His Name, Form, Actions and Attributes Are Transcendental 
His pastime of birth eternally. Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī responds by point- ing out that when an activity having the same format is performed at different intervals, it is considered to be one activity. He cites Sankarācārya's example that if someone says the word "cow" twice, it is not considered two separate actions but one. Just as when a yogi repeats a mantra on beads, it does not mean that he is chanting many mantras. Even if he sings or chants for hours, it is counted as one activity - the chanting of the mantra. If the chanter is the same, then the activity is also the same, no matter where he chants. Simi- larly, the Lord's pastimes, although appearing at difference places, are one, especially when seen from His point of view. They are enacted continuously without any break or interruption. It is only from our point of view that His pastimes appear to begin and end. Beyond our temporary vision, His pastimes are eternal. 
But this does not mean that the Lord's pastimes involve monoto- nous repetition, like those on a video recording. There is ever-fresh variety in His pastimes, just as there is such quality even in the sun- rises and sunsets occurring in different seasons and locations. In His different prakāśa manifestations, the Lord is one, yet in each He has an individual sense of Self and can thus act independently. So, He and His associates are able to enjoy differently in different places, while remaining unaware of their other prakāśa manifestations. per To understand transcendental knowledge of the Supreme Lord and His energies, we must first accept the reasonable axiom that the laws governing the spiritual nature are different from those gov- erning the material nature. One example of this was given in Anu- ccheda 42, where it was shown that Kṛṣṇa simultaneously married 16,000 princesses in the same number of ceremonies by expanding Himself 16,000 times, even though all those forms were one.

There can be no doubt that Kṛṣṇa's pastimes are eternal. The Vedic literature described His pastimes even before His appear- ance on this planet 5,200 years ago. In Padma Puraṇa, Gautama Rși advised Ambarīṣa Mahārāja to hear Srimad Bhagavatam. That conversation took place in an earlier yuga. In addition, the Agamas prescribe meditations on Kṛṣṇa's pastimes. The specific reason for this recommendation is that a devotee can enter into Kṛṣṇa's eternal 
435 
Śrī Bhagavat Sandarbha 
pastimes simply by meditating on them. Such a recommendation would be futile if the Lord's pastimes were not eternal. In GĪTĀ 4.10, Kṛṣṇa Himself declares that His birth and actions are transcenden- tal, and that many people in the past have attained Him through knowledge of His pastimes. alas 
BOAlthough Kṛṣṇa appears to take birth and engage in work, His birth and actions are not like those of ordinary human beings. Some- times His actions appear ordinary, sometimes extraordinary, but in either case there is no tinge of the gunas of material nature in them. When He descended as the son of Devaki, His birth appeared ordi- nary in the sense that she became pregnant and experienced the delivery of her child. When Kṛṣṇa appeared, He also inspired Devaki with the feeling that she had delivered Him, and so she genuinely considered herself to be His mother.gofal qme so baoreet 
In reality, however, there was nothing ordinary about Kṛṣṇa's birth pastime. First He appeared in His four-armed Visņu form, clad in yellow garments, and then He turned into a newborn baby. His appearance can be compared to the moon, which is always full, but only appears that way to our vision on the full moon day. 
At other times, the Lord chooses to appear without conforming to any material laws or conventions. One of His most extraordinary appearances was in the form of Nrsimha, half-man and half-lion. On that occasion, He sprung out of a pillar.

When Krsna desires to perform human-like pastimes, He enters the world like an ordinary baby. But one should not think that the Lord enters the womb of His mother via the semen of His father, as in the case of ordinary human beings. At this point someone may object that Srimad Bhagavatam itself clearly describes Śrī Kapila's birth through the semen of Kardama Muni: 
heritdugb 
After many, many years, Lord Madhusudana entered Devahuti through Kardama's semen and then appeared from her, just as fire Indemerges from wood. (SB 3.24.6)46d saved bozivbo ey sammy & art offibbin opice Willies

436 
47 His Name, Form, Actions and Attributes Are Transcendental 
Jav In this verse, the word virya, or semen, has been used. So how can it be said that the Lord does not take birth like an ordinary child? 
Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī states that in this case the word virya refers to the power of Kardama's bhakti. Śrī Kapila was captivated by the power of Kardama's devotion and thus agreed to appear as his son. Semen is only one of the various meanings of the word virya. Accord- ing to the Ayurveda, food turns into blood, flesh, fat and so on. The final item is semen, which is called virya because it gives vitality to the body. 
Est 
16 According to Amara-kośa dictionary, virya means strength and influence (viryam bale prabhave ca, Amara-kośa 3.3.155). Medini- kośa states that virya means influence, semen, prowess and ability (viryam prabhave sukre ca tejaḥ-samarthayor api). Therefore, viryam apannaḥ should be taken to mean, "He appeared by the force of Kardama Muni's devotional intensity." 
Another way of looking at it is that virya is sometimes used as an indirect reference to a son, as it is the source of the son. This is analogous to calling the fruit of a mango tree by the same name. If we take this meaning, then viryam āpannah would simply mean that He "became Kardama's son." bathnio bi samood battil rly The Lord's actions, like His birth, are not ordinary, though they may appear to be so to mundane eyes. The actions of an ordinary person are products of the material gunas. But the Lord acts out of His own will through His internal energy, even while displaying His pastimes in the material world.um of 910m mit vns worl, svitom 
Vedanta-sutra explains this. In vs 2.1.32, an objection is raised, "The Lord does not create, because He has no purpose to achieve" (na prayojanavattvät). A person performs an action to attain a goal, either for himself or for others. Since the Lord is ātmārāma, or self- fulfilled, He has no reason to act. It defies logic to say that the Lord creates for the sake of the jiva, for He is compassionate by nature and would not condemn the jiva to a place to suffer birth, death, old age and disease.

In response, Śrīla Vyasa wrote the next sutra-lokavat tu līlā- kaivalyam (vs 2.1.33), "The Lord creates, however, merely out of play." Śrīla Baladeva Vidyabhuṣaṇa explains in his Govinda-bhāṣya

commentary that the word tu (however) is used to indicate removal of doubt. That the Lord creates merely out of play is also confirmed by Gauḍapada in his Mandukya-kärikā: late even evini 
ия 
Indeed, the Lord, who is self-fulfilled, creates out of His own nature, not to achieve something He lacks. (Mandukya-kärikā 1.9) 47 
Just as Kṛṣṇa creates merely out of play, so too does He engage in other activities -lila-kaivalya. He acts out of exuberance, just as an intoxicated man dances. This example is meant to show only that the Lord acts out of delight. It does not mean that He loses His quality of omniscience, as a drunkard loses awareness of his behavior. More- over, His actions are not motivated by a desire to enjoy; rather, they are a display of His innate joy, His svarupananda. If He were to act in order to experience enjoyment, that would mean He lacks it. In fact, His very form is made up of transcendental being, awareness and bliss, just as ours is made of the material gunas. 
Some scholars compare Bhagavan's actions to breathing, which occurs naturally without any motive or conscious effort, even during deep sleep. As with the example of the drunkard, this analogy is also limited, because the omniscient Lord is never ignorant or uncon- scious, like a sleeping man. In deep sleep one breathes even though unconscious. The Lord, however, is omniscient and never unaware of His actions. Ledt 08, 2009

Since Kṛṣṇa's enactment of the material creation is free from motive, how many times more so must be His internal pastimes with His devotees? They are manifestations of His svarupa-sakti alone (SB 10.16.47). Because the Lord's pastimes are neither material nor performed for any selfish motive, even ätmärämas like Sukadeva, who have no interest in anything material, hear them with great relish. 16 yea of oigal asieb 11 
The transcendental nature of Krsna's birth and actions can be realized only when one is free from identification with the body- mind-ego self, fostered by māyā. This is the purport of the following verses by Sûta Gosvāmi: ad otorwsze si sannaze n to do vlays ovawod asdesto bral sin

When these gross and subtle forms are denied through self- ou knowledge, being recognized as created out of ignorance, at that tu moment one attains realization of Brahman. If the Lord's māyā should recede and the self become enriched with divine conscious- ness, then, say the wise, he is established in his own glory. And, in the same way, the wise describe the births and actions of the unborn and inactive Lord of the Heart, which are hidden to the Vedas. (SB 1.3.33-35) 48 
th 
This indirectly states that Bhagavan's birth and actions are not material, and that is why one has to become completely free from identification with the material body-mind to be able to realize them. The phrase brahma-darśana indicates direct realization of Bhagavan and His pastimes. For this reason, liberated beings describe the birth and actions of the unborn Lord, which are confidentially told in the Vedas. This also indicates that the bliss of hearing His pastimes is superior to the bliss of Brahman realization; otherwise, liberated beings, like Sukadeva Gosvāmi, would not have an iota of interest in them. This certainly proves that Bhagavan's pastimes are not mate- rial, and it is with this intention that Sūta Gosvāmī refers to the Lord as akarta (the non-doer), and ajana (the unborn). 
Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi also quotes the commentary of Śrīdhara Svāmi on the two verses SB 10.48.23-24, in which he too accepts Bhagavan's birth and pastimes as līlā, or play.

These two verses do not contradict the Visnu Purana verse previ- ously cited. At first glance, the use of the word kalpanā (concep- tualization) in VP 5.18.53 seems futile, since the speaker's intent would be sufficiently clear simply by stating, "Name, class and so on, do not exist within You.” [On closer inspection, however, this word is highly significant, as will be shown, since it is not that the Lord is devoid of name, class and so on, but rather, His name and class are self-existent and hence prior to conceptual- ization. It is for this reason that His name is imperceptible to mind and speech.] Moreover, words like brahma and aja (unborn) [also mentioned in the verse] are acknowledged as names that establish the subject as transcendental.de dona lis th

In statements such as, "There is a single goat, red, white and black in hue [...],”5± that specific class ( jāti ) characterized as pertain- ing to the state of birthlessness is also indicated [since, as already noted, the word aja means both a goat and unborn. Hence, the statement could be rendered, “There is one unborn...”]. Addition- ally, the statement that there is no conceptualization of name, and so on, in the Lord is apparently contradicted by the one that follows it, stating that He has names, such as Kṛṣṇa and Acyuta. If these are kalpanā (lit., “ imaginary”), how can He be worshiped by them? Thought constructs, or kalpanās, are unstable and imper- manent, so how can names like Krsna be said to be eternal?

Visņu, whose names, forms and activities are incomprehensible," VP 5.2.19), the Visnu Purana statement should be understood as fol- lows: [The eternal Absolute is He] in whom (yatra) conceptual- izations of names, forms and so on (nama-jäty-ādi-kalpanah) do not exist. The word nama (names) refers to Krsna and other such names. [That there is no conceptualization (kalpana) in regard to the name Kṛṣṇa indicates that it exists prior to the act of naming or mental assignation.] The word jāti (classes) refers to Kṛṣṇa's lilă of appearance within the classifications of gods, humans, or warrior-kings. [That there is no kalpana in regard to Kṛṣṇa's līlā of appearance within these classes indicates that His existence transcends all such categorization.] And the word adi (and so on) means anything else in regard to Him. [So conceptualizations do not exist in regard to His names, the classes within which He appears or anything else in relation to Him]. Rather, it is to be understood that all of these are simply manifestations of the eter- nal potency of His essential nature, as indicated in the following verse discussed earlier [Anuccheda 47.1]:

self-existent Lord, fully comprehending the nature of material names and their corresponding objects, is worshiped instead, through self-existent, celebrated names, such as Kṛṣṇa, by the sages and Vedas.

Thus, the Lord is not glorified by manufactured names, or in other words, by names that are a product of conceptualization.

It should be understood that only those names that are celebrated in scripture, that invoke instant remembrance of the Lord, and that manifest their potency even if chanted inci- dentally, are to be considered self-existent. All other names are a product of thought-construction. 
अथवा हे नाथ । यत्र नामजात्यादीनां कल्पना न विद्यन्ते तत् केवलं विशेष्यरूपं परमं ब्रह्म भवान् । तत्तत्कल्पनाया अविषयत्वे हेतुः - विशेषेण करोति लीलायत इति विकारि तथा न भवतीत्यविकारीति । तद्रूपेण न जायते न प्रकटीभवतीति हे अजेति च । ततः किमवलम्ब्य तत्र नामजात्यादिकल्पनाः क्रियन्तामिति भावः । 
An alternative explanation is as follows: O Lord, Your unquali- fied feature, in which there are no conceptualizations of names and classes, is called Parabrahman. The reason for the absence of such conceptualizations is that in Brahman there are no pas- times (avikāri). Vikāri means one who acts in a unique way, i.e., engages in pastimes. Brahman does not manifest form and is thus addressed as aja (unborn). On what basis then can Brahman be conceptualized in terms of name or class? This is the import. तत्तत्कल्पनां विना च सर्वस्याप्यर्थस्य वस्तुमात्रस्याधिगममात्रं न भवेत् किमुत तादृशब्रह्म- स्वरूपस्य भवतः । कल्पनामयनामजात्यादयस्तु न कस्यापि स्वरूपधर्मा भवन्ति । यत एवं

Without conceptualization of name and category there is no pos- sibility of understanding anything about any object whatsoever. So what to speak of You, whose form is Brahman, as described above? Conceptualized names and categories cannot convey the natural characteristics of any object. Therefore, You are wor- shiped only through names, such as Kṛṣṇa, that establish some specific quality in You and are capable of granting all human goals, just as You are, even if remembered only incidentally. [And so You] are glorified by the eternally existing Vedas, Purāņas and so on, but You are not worshiped by merely conceptualized names that attempt to depict Your unqualified feature.

Similarly, in the section of Gopala-tapani Upanisad wherein the 18-syllable mantra consisting of the Lord's names is described, Śrī Brahma says, "While manifesting the future universe in those letters," (GTU 1.26).55 Thus, the Lord's names are self-existent because they are distinct from ordinary sound, being the cause of the universe consisting of material elements, such as sound, which come into existence only later on. And because the Lord's name is nondifferent from His form, it is distinct from material sound.

47 His Name, Form, Actions and Attributes Are Transcendental 
Commentary 
After establishing that the birth and actions of Bhagavan are tran- scendental and distinct from those of mortal beings, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī verifies that Kṛṣṇa's names are also spiritual. The Lord is called anămă (lit., "nameless"), because He does not have material names. In this material world a child is given a name at birth and naturally belongs to a caste, class, tribe, sect or race. These bodily designations, of name, class and nationality, are material and tem- porary. They last only as long as the body remains, and at times, can change, even within the course of the same life. 
As proven earlier, however, the Lord's birth is transcendental and eternal, so it naturally follows that His Name is also eternal. His Names are found in the Vedic mantras, which are eternal. His Form is eternal and the Nyaya school of logic concludes, "The attributes of an eternal substance are also eternal" (nityam gatam nityam, Tarka- sangraha 3.6). Thus, the Lord's Name and other attributes are eternal manifestations of His internal potency. 
There is no one who can assign Kṛṣṇa a name, because He existed prior to everyone and thus prior to the act of naming. As a matter of fact, He is the one who has given names to all objects, which are created by Him: 
Knowledge of the names of various objects and the respective duties of various people was obtained by Śrī Brahma from the words of the Vedas, and thus he propagated the classification of names and duties. (MANU 1.21)60 
Śri Krsna is known as Vedantakṛt (GĪTĀ 15.15), and He spoke the Vedas to Śrī Brahma (SB 11.14.3). The names and classes assigned to people are not part of their essential nature; they can be modified or replaced by new ones without causing any change of essence. They serve only to assist in empirical dealings. A fool can be named pandita-siromani (the crown jewel of scholars), and a blind man, padma-locana (lotus-eyed one), but this will not have any bearing on

their nature. There is no factual relation between a person's names and his attributes. Such is not the case with the Lord's names, how- ever, as Kṛṣṇa is nondifferent from His Names, and therefore, His complete potency also exists in His Names. This is confirmed by Śrī Caitanya Mahaprabhu: is 5mg and airy Totsvan fatrate 
bru 
O my Lord, You have unlimited names, and You have infused these names with all Your potencies. Furthermore, You have not enforced any rules, as to where or when these names are to be remembered. Such is Your mercy, O Lord, and yet I am so unfortunate that I have no love for them. (Sikṣāṣṭaka 2)61

гі эти Śrī Kṛṣṇa's names may convey an attribute He possesses, such as ghana-syama, "He who is blackish like a fresh monsoon rain cloud," or they may convey His pastimes, such as giridhari, "He who lifted Govardhana Hill." Because He is inherently self-endowed with trans-conventional qualities and eternally manifests trans-egoic play (līlā), there is no need for Him to be assigned merely conceptu- alized names that are incapable of reflecting His true nature.org 918 It was a practice in Vedic culture that after the birth of a child, learned brāhmaṇas would be invited to prepare the horoscope and assign an appropriate name corresponding to the child's prospec- tive future. For example, one can allude to the naming ceremonies of Parīkṣit Mahārāja and Śrī Kṛṣṇa in Śrīmad Bhagavatam. This is the reason why names in the Vedic literature so precisely match the character of those they designate. The correspondence is so close, in fact, that it leads skeptics to interpret the stories as mere fable, rea- soning that apt names must have been chosen by the author.sbby bh According to Vedic authorities, even letters have transcendental potency. Jaimini states in his Mimāṁsä-sutra, "Words are certainly eternal and their pronunciation conveys meaning to others," (nityas tu syad darśanasya pararthatvāt, Mimāṁsä-sutra 1.1.18). Bhagavān Upavarṣa, a great Mimāṁsaka, says that every letter is a word, and

448 
47 His Name, Form, Actions and Attributes Are Transcendental 
thus letters are eternal. For this reason, letters in Sanskrit are called akṣara (imperishable). Moreover, if words are considered eternal, their constituent parts must also be eternal. Again, logic dictates that it is not possible to have an eternal object with temporal com- ponents, because, "What is not in the cause cannot be in the effect" (kāraṇābhāvāt kāryābhāvaḥ, Vaiśeṣika-sūtra 1.1.13).

250According to Śrī Kṛṣṇa, words are a manifestation of Brahman:

The Supreme Lord, who supplies life to all, reveals Himself in the chakras of the human body. Having entered the mūlādhāra-cakra Falong with the sonant prāna and assumed subtle forms composed of mind-stuff2 He manifests Himself in a gross form [on the tongue] consisting of vowels, accent and consonants. (SB 11.12.17)6317

This is also the opinion of Tantrikas and grammarians like Pāṇini. 
An objection may be raised here. It is our common experience that words are spoken with the help of vocal chords, the tongue, palate, lips and so on, and are then lost immediately. So how can words be accepted as eternal? The answer is that the tongue and mouth do not create the words, they only pronounce them and con- vey them to others. Words exist eternally, and the action of speech only makes them audible. Speech can be compared to the light that makes objects in a dark room visible; it does not create them. 99

The Holy Name of the Lord is certainly eternal, being nondif- ferent from Him, self-existent and conscious in nature. Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmi here selects a few texts from the Vedas and Purānas to estab- lish the conscious nature of the Name. Sabda is the only pramāņa (valid means of knowledge) adequate to ascertain knowledge of the T99abrod Ististem ni anismer Ilija 62 The word (vak) has four stages of manifestation: pară, pasyanti, madhyama and vaikhari. Vaikhari is the gross form, manifested in speech. Madhyama is the mental translation of form into name, and pasyanti is the intuitive thought form prior to mental translation. These are associated with viśuddha-cakra (the throat center), anahata-cakra (the heart center) and manipura-cakra (the navel center), respectively. Para is pure sakti, present as the kundalini energy in the ton mūlādhāra-cakra. See Śrīdhara Svāmi's commentary to this verse.

reality that underlies and transcends material nature. Śri Suka has clearly explained the glories of the Holy Name in Srimad Bhagavatam, especially in the account of Ajamila. The Holy Name can liberate a person even if chanted incidentally-since an object's power does not depend on the knowledge of its user (vastu-saktir na hi buddhim apekṣyate). Fire will burn, whether one touches it knowingly or by accident. Similarly, the name of the Lord burns sins to ashes, whether chanted knowingly or unknowingly, with faith or without faith: 
As fire burns dry grass to ashes, so the Holy Name of the Lord, whether chanted knowingly or unknowingly, unfailingly burns all reactions of one's sinful acts to ashes. Just as medicine of the high- est curative potency will surely act even on a person ignorant of its efficacy, even if taken by chance, so too the name of the Lord will act even if uttered as a matter of coincidence.

Pranava (Om) is Parabrahman, and is said to be transcenden- tal. Pranava is unprecedented, imperishable, without exterior las or interior, and beyond which, there is nothing. Pranava is the beginning, middle and end of everything. Knowing praṇava in this way, one attains Him. Know pranava to be the Supreme Lord (Iśvara) in everyone's heart. A sober person who knows the all- pervading Om no longer laments. Om is immeasurable, unlim- Vited, all-auspicious and the end of dualism. Only one who knows d -Om is to be considered a wise sage, and no one else. (Mandukya- ar kärikä 26-29)72

In Śrutis as well as the Smrtis, there are descriptions of various types of sacrifice, austerity, charity or chanting of mantras for attaining different objectives, either in this life or after death. There are also detailed descriptions of atonements (prayaścitta) for becoming free of one's sins, some of which are quite difficult to perform. For exam- ple, if a twice-born person, dvija, drinks wine unknowingly, then he should drink hot cow urine until death (MANU 11.90)780

It is also common experience that to achieve something in the material world, one has to work very hard. Based on this knowl- edge, it is very hard to believe that one can attain anything, spiri- tual or material, merely by chanting some sounds, even if they are identified as Holy Names. Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi warns against such a mentality. He says that one should not think that these scriptural statements are artha-vada, or exaggerated glorification.

blu According to Purva-mīmāmsā, the Vedas contain five types of statements: vidhi, mantra, nama-dheya, niṣedha and artha-vāda?" The purpose of artha-vada is to encourage people to perform certain religious acts and discourage their opposite, irreligious acts. Such statements are either eulogistic or critical in nature. For example, there is an injunction in Taittiriya-samhita, "One desirous of wealth should sacrifice a horse to the wind-god."80 In another part of the same Samhita, Vayu is glorified so that one might be prone to wor- ship him: "Vayu is indeed the swiftest of the gods." This glorifica- tion of the wind-god implies that he will quickly reward his wor- shipers, and this will in turn incite people to sacrifice a horse for him. Because it has such a motive, this statement of glorification of the wind-god is also included in the category of artha-vada. 
The scriptural statements glorifying the Holy Name are not in the same category, and should not be considered exaggerations. To do so is to commit one of the ten offenses against the Holy Name, tathartha- vādo hari-nāmni kalpanam (PP, Brahma-khanda 25.15).ad 
Moreover, if statements eulogizing the chanting of the Holy Names are considered artha-vāda, then naturally the question arises: For which vidhi, or injunction, is such artha-vāda put forth? This is because artha-vada is always subordinate and supplemen- tary to particular injunctions, or vidhi-väkya. This vidhi could be for the chanting itself or for some other imperative. There are no state- ments regarding the Holy Name that its chanting forms part of a separate vidhi. If, on the other hand, the vidhi is chanting itself, then there is no difference between the injunction to chant and eulogy of chanting, as both are direct statements recommending one to chant. Moreover, any injunction that recommends the performance of an activity and directly states its benefits should not be considered as artha-väda. When the direct or primary meaning is applicable, one

Another objection may be raised. If the Lord's name is transcen- dental, how can it be uttered with one's material tongue? Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi says that the Name is not vibrated with the tongue. It is self-manifest, just like the Lord, and appears by its own will. This is also the verdict of Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmi: di basbni al y unid gide 
Tow ald 
Ligai bog To? Because the name, form and other attributes of Śrī Kṛṣṇa are tran- scendental, they are imperceptible to the material senses. But when a devotee offers the self in full devotion, then only do the Name and other attributes manifest themselves, of their own accord, on the Stongue and other senses. (BRS 1.2.234)836ta lage sor 02 ob of anon 1993 abianos ad ion blooda brewrOS 
A vivid example is Bharata Mahāraja, who took birth as a deer. When faced with death, the deer chanted the name of Hari (SB 5.14.45). Normally, a deer has no ability to produce articulate sound, but in this case the Name manifested on its tongue when the creature desired to chant. This proves that the Holy Name is independent and can manifest by its own sweet will, being nondif- ferent from the Supreme Lord, who is its Repository. Gajendra, the elephant, is another example of an animal to whom the Holy Name became self-manifest (SB 8.3.32). 
Not only the Holy Name, but the Vedas too are self-manifest. In the Eleventh Canto, Krsna describes this phenomenon to Uddhava: 
The transcendental sound of the Vedas is very difficult to compre- hend and manifests on different levels within the prana, senses and the mind. This Vedic sound is unlimited, immeasurably deep and arcunfathomable, just like the ocean. to theith ad noWahay-ar

ed 
An objection can be raised here. If the Holy Name is so powerful and glorious, then why do people in general not feel its potency, even after daily chanting thousands of times? Excluding the narrations of great devotees in scripture, it is almost impossible to find a person who has experienced the full power of the Holy Name, as described. 
The reply to this is that chanting must be free from offenses. Just as chanting pleases the Lord, an offense displeases Him. Naturally, a disposition that is displeasing, in the sense of inharmonious with the complete Reality that is Bhagavan, inhibits the Holy Name from manifesting its power. Just as, a servant may serve his king in var- ious ways, but if at the end of the day he were to abuse the king, the latter would certainly be upset. And the displeasure would be greater still if such abuse were leveled at the time of service. The king would no doubt punish such a servant. 
One must therefore avoid even the slightest offense. Although fire has the power to burn grass, it will not burn grass that is green. The grass must be dry before it will burn. Offenses are so power- ful that even the living liberated (jivan-mukta) can fall from the liberated status. Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī writes: 
Bha

Even bhāva, the permanent awakening to transcendental being, can disappear altogether if one commits a grievous offense to someone who is very dear to Kṛṣṇa. If the offense is of medium gravity, bhāva can mutate into a mere facsimile of itself (bhāvābhāsa). Offenses of lesser gravity can transform bhava of a higher grade of intensity and completion into bhava of a lesser grade. (BRS 1.3.54)85

sho The monkey Dvivida was a servant of Lord Ramacandra, but he committed an offense towards Lakṣmaṇa. The result was that he became demoniac and finally had to be killed by Lord Balarama. 
An offense to a devotee is also an offense towards the Holy Name. This offense makes one's heart as hard as stone and incapable of feel- ing any of the effects of chanting. Therefore, more important than just chanting, is to avoid offenses. If one is not cautious to avoid offenses, the chanting will implicate him more and more in mate- rial life. It is like potent medicine: If taken wrongly, it will have a powerful adverse reaction. Therefore, Śrī Caitanya advised that one should always chant the names of Hari with appropriate respect for all beings, and without desiring any respect for oneself (amānina mānadena kīrtanīyaḥ sada hariḥ). The injunction to be respectful and humble in this verse precedes the order to chant (Sikṣāṣṭaka 3).

Śrīdhara Svāmi comments: "The question was asked in chap- ter 8 (SB 2.8.8) that since the relation between the Lord and His body [seems to be] no different from that of an ordinary living being, how is it possible for a being to become liberated by offer- ing devotion to Him? The [above] verse is put forth in answer to this question: "To purify his understanding of the nature of the self (atma-tattva-viśuddhy-artham); in other words, this teach- ing is intended for the individual self, the jiva, in order to purify his understanding of the Absolute, i.e., to bestow explicit and unequivocal knowledge of the Absolute.

"What was that knowledge? That 'which the Lord spoke' to Brahma, namely, knowledge regarding His own devotional ser- vice, including such elements as austerity. Was He doing any- thing else at that moment? Yes, He did so while revealing His own true (rta) form, that is, His form of highly condensed aware- ness (cid-ghana). What was the reason for His showing this form? Brahma had served the Lord with his non-pretentious austerity.

"The implication is this: The relationship between the jiva and his material body is unreal, caused by ignorance. But in the case of Bhagavan, His transcendental body is manifest by His internal energy, yoga-maya. This difference is immense. Thus, liberation can be attained through devotion to Him."""

The word varna in sB 10.3.20 refers to form and not just to color. Even if we take the verse to mean that the Lord has a guna-maya form, i.e., one that has material attributes, the intention would then be that His form illuminates those particular gunas, i.e., sattva, rajas and tamas. The word śukla (white ) should thus not be taken to mean the color white, because it will be established in Paramātma Sandarbha that Śrī Viṣņu appears in a blackish complexion, as Kṣirodakaśāyī Visņu, the guṇāvatāra who main- tains the universe. Furthermore, Lord Siva, who annihilates the human beings, is white in color, which renders the above explanation contradictory. The same is stated in Sandhyopāsanā, described by Gobhila. Therefore, it is not the intent of this verse to say that Brahma's complexion is reddish. There is no correla- tion of the three gunas of nature to the three colors [mentioned in the verse]. The most ignorant tāmasic beings, like cranes, are white in color, while sages, like Śrī Bādarāyaṇa and Sri Suka, who are worshiped by those situated in sattva, are described as being black.

By His mercy (sva-māyayā) upon His devotees, the Supreme Lord manifests these forms within the cosmos. According to Viśva- prakāśa dictionary, "Maya can mean either cheating or mercy." Bibharşi (to assume, take, support) means that the Lord mani- fests His form within the cosmos. Red implies excessive attach- ment, expressed as the desire to create, due to the influence of rajo-guna, or the active influence. Black implies an absence

Vasudeva then anticipates that Kṛṣṇa may raise the following objection to his preceding statement, "Why do You bewilder peo- ple by giving them such improper explanations? At present, I have accepted a blackish form out of tamas, in order to vanquish the asuras." This meaning could also be deduced from Vasudeva's previous statement. Vasudeva responds to this hypothetical argument by speaking the following verse:

The import is as follows: Let us disregard for a moment other evi- dence, proclaiming You as concentrated Brahman and as consti- tuted of unalloyed being-awareness (śuddha-sattva). Even if we postulate that you accept suitable forms according to the gunas of nature, an instance where such meaning could be applicable is in the case of dissolution, which is the cause of misery and is similar to deep sleep. In fact, however, this meaning does not apply here, because at this particular time, this form of Kṛṣṇa has appeared to protect the world and is thus the cause of joy. This form is suit- able for vanquishing the asuras, who are in the guna of ignorance, and when you destroy them, even these asuras will attain Your mercy in the form of liberation, which is beyond all the gunas. A text should be interpreted according to the context, just as when one is told to bring saindhava, it can refer either to salt or a horse. Thus, it is said : Yo Shilonar shabarvas

Fostering the quality of nature that predominates at any partic- ular period, the Lord empowers the devas and rṣis when sattva is prominent, the asuras when rajas dominates, and the Yaksas and Rāksasas when tamas prevails. (SB 7.1.8) to ancillin d

Therefore, Kṛṣṇa's black color is not due to the guna of ignorance, nor is the Lord red in rajo-guna, or white in sattva, as opined in the objection. The implication is that by the principle of the remainder, Bhagavan's form is a manifestation of His internal potency alone. Similarly, Devaki Devi has already indicated the same meaning, when she said out of deference for the Lord, "Your form is unmanifest and primeval" (SB 10.3.24).95

Commentary 
wee vd be 
Śrila Jiva Gosvāmī has proved that the Lord's name is transcendental and nondifferent from Him. It follows that His body is also spiritual, because a material object cannot have transcendental name. The bodies of the conditioned living beings are products of the material gunas. In reality, the body is not owned by the pure self, but owing to ignorance, consciousness is projected upon the body-mind com- plex, and the self then mistakenly identifies with its own projection. In Kṛṣṇa's case, however, His body is constituted purely of conscious- ness and is nondifferent from Him. The living entity accepts a mate- rial body under the laws of karma, but the Lord's body is beyond such laws. His various forms are manifest by yoga-maya. Therefore, it is certainly possible to become liberated by worshiping His form.

Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī cites SB 10.3.20-21 to explain the purposes behind the Lord's various forms. 
க 
Śrī Kṛṣṇa conducts the functions of creation, maintenance and destruction of the cosmos through three guṇāvatāras, namely Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Siva. Although Brahma and Śiva contact the gunas, Śri Visnu is always transcendental to them. This is Śrī Suka's conclusion to his account of Vṛkasura. The colors mentioned in SB 10.3.20 do not refer to the bodily hue of the particular deities, but indicate the material guņas. Śrī Viṣṇu is blackish, Śiva is white, and Brahma is golden. There is no rule that white represents the guna of sattva, and so on. A crane is white in color, appears strikingly beautiful, and stands peacefully in the water on one leg, like a yogi

in meditation. But its purpose is to catch fish and devour them alive. This is an activity in the guna of ignorance. bred kon 
On the other hand, Śrīla Vyasa is black in color and grim of appearance, as he himself says, "Let them tolerate my ugly form, that is austerity enough for them" (MB 1.104.46). But Vyasa is accepted as a transcendental sage and an avatara of the Lord. nisem smea 
The following objection is then raised. Śrī Kṛṣṇa is black because He came to kill the demons, which is confirmed in SB 10.3.20. There- fore, His color is commensurate with His activities in tamas. This proposal is refuted by Vasudeva in the next verse, SB 10.3.21, where he says that the Lord appeared to offer protection - tvam asya lokasya vibho rirakṣiṣuh. Bhagavan's killing of demons serves only to protect His devotees, which is the real purpose of His appearance. By slaying the demons, He grants them liberation. Although there is misery in death, Śrī Kṛṣṇa's killing relieves them of all material misery. Therefore, His killing of demons cannot be put in the same category as Lord Śiva's work of destruction, which is performed through the guna of ignorance.

The meaning of a word must be ascertained according to its con- text. Saindhava means "horse" as well as "salt." If the master orders, "Bring saindhava," while eating, the servant should bring him salt. If he gives the same order while standing at the gate, however, the servant should bring him a horse. Similarly, śveta has two mean- ings, "white," or "maintenance." One should accept the most suit- able meaning and should not think the Lord's bodily hue represents His being associated with a particular material guna. 
Ben 
Therefore, Śrī Kṛṣṇa should not be considered influenced by the guna of ignorance because of His blackish hue or because He engaged in killing demons. His body is transcendental and His bodily color is also a manifestation of the internal potency. Just as He manifests a variety of forms according to His will, He similarly manifests a vari- ety of colors in His different avataras. All His forms and colors are interchangeable. Nothing is impossible for Bhagavan, the complete personal nondual Whole.

The killing performed by Him is also transcendental. It grants liberation to demons, and thus it cannot be taken as an act influ- enced by the guna of ignorance. As said earlier by Śrī Śuka, Śrī Kṛṣṇa is never touched by the material gunas, puruṣaḥ prakrteḥ paraḥ (SB 10.88.5).

We now resume our original discussion [of SB 8.3.8]. The distinc- tive feature of the Lord's attributes is that they are extraordinary [adbhūta, literally, transcending (ati) all that has come into being (bhūta)], as understood from the fact that they attract the mind even of liberated sages, who delight in the Self alone (ātmārāma). This is directly stated by Śrī Sūta Gosvāmi, as follows:

The sages, though freed from the knot of ego, and though delight- ing in the Self alone, engage in causeless devotion to Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the majestic player. Such are the entrancing qualities of Śri Hari. 
His mind captivated by Lord Hari's qualities, Sukadeva, the pow- erful son of Vyasadeva, and ever-beloved of the Lord's devotees, regularly studied this great book, Srimad Bhagavatam. (SB 1.7. 10-11)9878 doobs voeringastamos Initstem tisd

Now let us complete the explanation of the remaining part of the principal verse in this section (i.e., SB 8.3.8). 
तदेवं स्वरूपशक्तिविलासरूपत्वेन तेषां जन्मादीनाम् प्राकृताद् वैलक्षण्यं साधितम् । तत्र आशङ्कते – ननु भवन्तु स्वस्वरूपभूतान्येव तानि तथापि स्वरूपस्यैव पूर्णत्वात् तत्तत्प्राप्तौ किं प्रयोजनम् ?

We have already shown that the Lord's birth, form and so on, are manifestations of the internal energy, and are thus distinct from their material counterparts. Now a doubt may here be raised: Even if we accept that features, such as the Lord's birth and form,

are manifestations of His essential nature (svarupa), yet, if His svarupa is complete, what need is there of His accepting them?o

In answer to this, it is said, "He does so for the purpose of creat- ing and destroying this material world" (lokapyaya-sambhavāya). [This is here interpreted to mean, "for the purpose of bestowing the bliss of devotion upon His devotees after bringing their mate- rial existence to an end." This is explained as follows:] The word loka (lit., "world" or "people") here refers to the devotees; apyaya (lit., "destruction" or "disappearance"), means the cessation of their material existence. Coinciding with this occurrence, there is sambhava (lit., "creation" or "appearance"), namely, the incep- tion of the bliss of devotion. The verbal root √bhu [in sambhava] here means to attain. The fuller implication, however, is that the Lord is ever-endowed with name and form simply to increase the devotional bliss of His eternally liberated associates. Arjuna stated this in the First Canto:

The sense here is this: Just as there are other avataras, like the puruṣāvatāras, He too (Kṛṣṇa) is an avatara.

A further doubt is raised: Earlier [in Anuccheda 47.2] it was rhetorically asked, "Since the Lord is completely blissful, what has He to gain by creating the world?"101 How can this state- ment be true if the Lord does have a purpose, namely, to grant devotional bliss to His devotees? Far

In answer to this, the verse states, "You do so for the sake of those devotees who exist only for You" (ananya-bhavānām). The impli- cation is that the Lord, who is faultless and the crest-jewel of omniscience, would be guilty of the fault of unmercifulness if He neglected His devotees, who are exclusively dependent on Him. आत्मारामेऽपि कारुण्यगुणावकाशो “गुणा विरुद्धा अपि तु समाहार्याश्च सर्वतः” (कौर्मे) इति स्मरणात् विचित्रगुणनिधाने श्रीभगवत्येव सम्भवति । ततोऽन्यत्र तु सञ्चरिततद्गु- णांशे तदीय एव यः प्रतिपदमेव साश्चर्यं श्रुत्यादिभिरुच्चैर्गीयते । यश्चाविरिञ्चिमापामरज- नमाकर्षन्नेव वर्तते । तदुक्तं श्रीदशमे स्वयमेव (भा० १० । ३२ । १९-२० ) - 
Although the Lord is ātmārāma, delighting in the Self alone, the virtue of compassion is possible only in Him, who is the shelter of extraordinary qualities. For as Kurma Purana says, "Even contra- dictory qualities are accommodated in Him."102 When this qual- ity of compassion is found in others, it is an infusion of a portion of the Lord's compassion, which scriptures loudly glorify with wonder at every moment. This quality constantly attracts every- one, from Brahma to the most wretched fool. Bhagavan Himself declares in the Tenth Canto: odw, not vd obem

This has been expressed in the original verse under discussion (SB 8.3.8), with the words anukalam ṛcchati, "He accepts these [birth, actions, etc.] perpetually." Therefore, He certainly has no other purpose in mind. This purpose is simply a manifestation of the beatitude of He who is unlimitedly capable.

Commentaryisole 1-2 art wi 
After establishing that Bhagavan's birth, name, form and actions are eternal and transcendental, distinct from their material coun- terparts, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī continues to explain the original verse under discussion (SB 8.3.8) to establish that the Lord's qualities are of the same transcendental nature. 
To prove this, he alludes to the history of Sukadeva, the prime speaker of Srimad Bhagavatam. Sukadeva was so deeply absorbed in Brahman realization that he did not at all distinguish between male and female, and so was unconcerned even about covering him- self. Yet, as soon as he heard the verses describing the qualities of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, he was completely captivated. He gave up his fixation with unqualified Brahman and became a worshiper of the complete personal nondual Whole, Bhagavan. This practically demonstrates that Bhagavan's qualities are transcendental and superior even to the bliss of Brahman; otherwise, Śrī Śuka, who had no interest in anything material, would not have been drawn to them. 
9800 
After stating that the Lord's name, form, birth, actions and qual- ities are manifestations of His internal potency, a further doubt is raised. Bhagavan is complete in His own svarupa, so why does He accept birth and so on? Śrī Jiva answers that although Bhagavan delights in the Self alone, He engages in pastimes, such as taking birth and killing demons. This, however, does not make Him incom- plete. If He remained absorbed in His own internal bliss and did not act to protect His devotees, it could then be said that He is without mercy. Mercy, in fact, is one of His most excellent qualities, and it is precisely out of mercy for His devotees that He appears in the material world.

474 
47 His Name, Form, Actions and Attributes Are Transcendental 
Similarly, it is out of mercy that He forgets Himself and becomes a servant of His devotees. His merciful acts captivate the minds even of ātmārāmas. In some cases, a person is merciful, but incapable of helping others. Such mercy is impotent and becomes a cause of fur- ther misery. Therefore, one should not try to be merciful artificially. The Lord, however, is omnipotent, and thus His mercy nourishes His devotees. When He sees this, His bliss increases even beyond what He normally feels in His own svarupa. As was said earlier, energy yields greater pleasure when applied. For this reason, Kṛṣṇa performs these pastimes perpetually, as stated in the main verse of this section: anukalam rcchati. Therefore, Bhagavan's actions are a manifestation of His bliss and have no other purpose.

THEREFORE, the import of the Vedic statement, "He has no hands and legs" (śu 3.19) is that the Supreme Lord is inherently self- endowed with an eternal, unlimited, self-manifest, blissful form. The statement does not intend any other conclusion [such as, that the Absolute is hence formless and unqualified]. The personified Vedas establish this in their prayers to the Lord: 
त्वमकरणः स्वराडखिलकारकशक्तिधरस् तव बलिमुद्वहन्ति समदन्त्यजयानिमिषाः । वर्षभुजोऽखिलक्षितिपतेरिव विश्वसृजो

Though You are without any senses, You are the supremely inde- pendent upholder of everyone's sensory powers. Just as tribu- tary kings pay homage to an emperor, so do the administrators of the universe, accompanied by māyā, bear offerings to You, while gladly consuming the oblations [offered to them by human beings]. They carry out their responsibilities out of awe for You. (SB 10.87.28)1

The import is this: The word karana (sense)2 is used here to denote an instrument or tool, like a hatchet, which is utilized by the agent in order to accomplish his objectives, yet is entirely dis- tinct from him and functions purely as an extension of the agent. Karana does not include anything that is an integral part of the agent's nature, as burning potency is to fire. In such cases, the word karana would have a secondary meaning. Furthermore [in this case], in the etymological derivation of the word svarat ("sup- remely independent," svena rājate), the word svena, which is in the instrumental case, indicates that [such powers are] part of Your essential nature. 
ततो जीवस्य चिद्रूपत्वात् पाण्यादीनां स्वतो जडत्वात् तदधीनशक्तीनां तेषां भिन्नतमानां करणत्वं मुख्यार्थमेव । ततोऽसौ तदासक्तत्वात् सकरणः ।

to juo of greisdress In the case of the living being, who is conscious by nature, the primary meaning of karana ("instrument" or "senses") applies to the hands and so on, which are by nature inert, dependent on the jiva's energy, and completely distinct from him. Therefore, because the jiva is connected to these senses (karana), he is called sa-karana, or a possessor of senses. 
त्वं तु तदन्तर्यामी तदनासक्तत्वात् तदनपेक्षो यतः स्वराट् स्वरूपशक्त्यैव राजसे इति । 
2 
The literal definition of karana is a means, instrument or tool, or any one of the senses. In this explanation, the terms used are all related to the grammatical case endings, kartā ("subject" or "nominative case"), karya ("object" or "accusative case"), and karana ("instrument" or "instrumental case"). The instrumental case is used in Sanskrit both in the sense of instrumentality (by means of) and accompaniment (with). Igmannsalsa supinu sa doda The derivation is given by Śrīdhara Svami as follows, "You exist, i.e., You are luminous by Yourself" (svena eva rajase dipyase). The dictionary (rūḍhi) definition of svarat is "independent, sovereign ruler," etc. Sanatana is more clear, "He who is self-existent with, or by means of, His own special saktis" (sva-śakti-viseṣenas svayaṁ rajata iti tatha saḥ).

You, on the other hand, are the Supreme Self dwelling in the inte- riority of each and every individual self. Being unattached to the individual's senses, You are independent of them. This is because You are svarāt, "Self-luminous by the potency inherent in Your own essential being” (svarūpa-śakti).

of the potency inherent in Your own essential being, svarupa- sakti. You exist (rajase) with senses that are a unique manifesta- tion of Your own svarupa. The implication is that because Your senses are part of Your own essential being, the term karana (senses) cannot be taken in the primary sense [i.e., as a tool or instrument]. Otherwise, if You manifested Yourself through something extraneous to Yourself (aupadhika), how could you be called 'supremely independent,' or svarāt?"

This means that You sup- ply all living beings with the physical seats of the senses, such as the eye, as well as with the energies within them, i.e., the sen- sory powers themselves. Since You thus maintain the senses of all living beings in their respective seats, You must naturally be endowed with senses that are self-existent, inexhaustible and complete. There are Vedic statements to this effect, such as,

The complete translation is, "The three worlds exist within His body. Through His senses arise the twofold senses of all beings. He Himself is consciousness. His breath is the source of bodily strength, sensory power and the actions of all embodied beings. He is the prime agent for the acts of creation, sustenance and dissolution through the agency of the material gunas."

defects and can be understood only by sabda, or revealed sound" (vs 2.1.27).13 Thus, Vyasa establishes that the Lord exists both with and without senses, according to the principle that objects beyond logic can be ascertained only through revelation. As the Śruti states, "He has no material body or senses" (su 6.8).14

An alternative interpretation of the verse is this: "Although You are the self-effulgent upholder of everyone's sensory pow- ers (akhila-käraka-śakti-dhara), You are without any senses (akarana)." Why? Because You are supremely independent (svarāt). And because Your magnificence is supremely distin- guished beyond all, the gods (animiṣaḥ), headed by Indra, and even the higher dimensional beings worthy of their worship, such as Brahma, the architect of the universe, also carry their offerings to you upon their heads. The prefix ut here means "aloft" (uccaiḥ), implying that they carry these offering on their heads [out of respect].

They are also accompanied by aja or māyā, who is their overseer. This means that in order for her own opulence to become actived, even she, who is Your shadow potency, carries offerings to You, who are endowed with unlimited inherent potencies.

The Śrutis reply: "The gods (animiṣaḥ), i.e., the presiding deities of the senses, carry their offerings to You. These gods are the cre- ators of the universe; they are called ajanaja (the presiding deities of the unmixed elements, such as mahat-tattva) and thus are the causes behind everything created. Other living beings are able to perceive sense objects through their individual senses only due to the support of these deities, who preside over the senses. But You in turn are the support of these presiding deities. Thus,

Commentary 
Jo Jreg a fon usbusgabro

CHAPTER 87 OF THE TENTH CANTO is called "The Prayers of the Personified Vedas," or Śruti-stuti. Great Bhagavatam scholars, like Śrīdhara Svāmi, have identified a significant mantra from the Upanisads to be the speaker of each of these twenty-eight verses. For example, the verse discussed in this section (SB 10.87.28) corre- sponds to the following mantra from Svetāśvatara Upanisad: 
483 
bo Śri Bhagavat Sandarbha T 
He has no feet or hands, yet runs swiftly and can grasp anything. Henle War sees without eyes and hears without ears. He knows whatever is to ad be known, but no one knows Him. The sages call Him the original and greatest conscious being (Puruşa). (SU 3.19) 17 
by Srila Jiva Gosvāmi 
mi says that the part 
Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī says that the purpose of this mantra is to estab- lish that the Lord has transcendental senses in His transcendental body. In the previous section, it was explained that the Lord's name, form, and actions are all transcendental. Since the Lord's form is transcendental, it follows that His senses are as well. To remove any doubts, however, Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmi will now explicitly show that this is so. 
By quoting both the verse from the Śruti-stuti and the corre- sponding Vedic mantras, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī shows how the Smrti and Śruti confirm each other. Nevertheless, rather than comment- ing directly on the Śruti mantra, Śrila Jiva Gosvāmi proceeds directly to the Bhāgavatam verse, which, after all, was spoken by the Śrutis personified. As such, they obviously understood the meaning of both these sources of revealed knowledge. 
The Śrutis say that the Lord is akaraṇa, or without external senses, because He is svarāt, or independent of anything external. The senses are called karana because they are inert instruments used by an agent to perform a particular activity or to acquire knowledge. In this respect, they are similar to the hatchet used by a woodcutter, as an instrument or tool for chopping wood. Just as the hatchet is distinct from the woodcutter, that is to say, is not part of him, so too the bodily senses are not a part of the jiva's essential nature. 
The agent's existence is not dependent on the senses, whereas the senses exist only to be utilized by the agent. Moreover, the senses cannot act independently, as they require an agent to direct and energize them in order to function. In the case of an ordinary jiva, the senses form part of the subtle body; they are material, but the ātmā invests consciousness into them. At the time of liberation, con- sciousness is freed from its apparent bondage to the material senses.

48 The Lord's Senses Are Transcendental 
If the ātmā were not distinct from the senses, there would be no question of liberation. savo la mailsuh styland Jon esobe -no In the Lord's case, however, there is no distinction between Him, His body and His senses; thus the Śrutis call Him svarāț, or inde- pendent of anything external: "The Lord exists by His own inherent power, and does not depend on anything other than Himself" (svena eva rajate iti svarāt).alldises ahir home affy bite 
The living being in the conditioned state is dependent on his material senses in order to function in the material world. For their part, however, the senses depend not only on the atma's presence in the physical body, but also on the controlling deities.' The Lord's senses, on the other hand, are part of His essential being (svarupa) and thus potent like Him. Therefore, any one of His senses can per- form the functions of the others, because they are not materially designed. This is confirmed by Śrī Brahmā: 
adi 
naming phdrà vd vino Bondanobuu I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, whose transcendental form is conscious, full of bliss, eternal and self-luminous. Each of the limbs of His body can perform the function of any other sense organ. He llev 
thus eternally sees, maintains, and manifests the infinite universes, both spiritual and mundane. (Brahma-samhita 5.32)19bal add odt to ylish griblasty sdr Joel of bad smerqueers to holzivisque This is also one of the imports of the Bhagavad Gitä verse that states: ionl brod art to E 
ybod lain en asense sdi to neilgque to roll other son al frol air Everywhere are His hands and legs; His eyes, head and mouth extend everywhere. (GĪTĀ 13.13)20 
ni ballostno 
A doubt naturally arises in this regard, "Why then are His senses called karanas, if they do not fulfill the definition of an instrument?" The answer is that they are called karanas in a secondary sense. This is because they can act like the senses but are without the limitations of the material senses. Krsna's eyes see, but are not limited to that function alone, as is the material eye. Furthermore, the Lord's senses

cannot be separated from Him. In the Lord's case, the phrasing "His senses" does not imply the dualism of owner and owned. notesup 
Nyāya-śāstra states, "An instrument (karana) is a non-common- place (i.e., specific) cause that plays an intermediary function."21 In other words, in order to see an object, the eye has to make con- tact with the object, and the mind then has to create a connection between the eye and the ātmā. This establishing of contact is the intermediary function. But the Lord is in direct contact with every- thing at all times. His contact with an object is not indirect, as in the case of a jīva. So, since there is no intermediary function involved in His perception, this definition of karana is not applicable to Him. Everything is available to Him at each and every moment, without any mediating factor. Although the Lord is the support and fountain- head of all the senses, He has no material senses. Su 6.8 thus states, "The Lord has neither duty nor material senses."22 This fact can be understood only by sabda-pramāņa, or revealed sound, and not by logic, as confirmed in vs 2.1.27. 
The Lord is not only the fountainhead of potency for all the senses, but He is the controller of their presiding deities as well. Devas like Indra, the presiding deity of the hands, work under the supervision of the Supreme Lord. In fact, the presiding deity of the material energy, maya, who supplies the ingredients for the mate- rial body and senses, is the maidservant of the Lord. In other words, the Lord is not the direct controller or supplier of the senses. The senses work under the supervision of the presiding deities, who are controlled in turn by the Lord. This again shows Kṛṣṇa's super- excellent position because it indicates that the senses of the Lord are not under the control of the gods. The Śrutis offer the example of a sovereign king who controls many provincial rulers, who in turn have their subjects. Śrī Kapila confirms this in Śrimad Bhagavatam: 
Throughout the ages, the presiding deities of the three gunas, who control everything mobile and immobile, carry out their functions

48 The Lord's Senses Are Transcendental 
of creation, maintenance and destruction out of fear of the Lord. (SB 3.29.44)23 
One of the meanings of the word akarana (without senses), is that the Lord, as Supreme Indwelling Self, sits in the material body next to the individual self. The living being perceives the material world through the senses of the body. He is therefore called sa-karaṇa, "being endowed with or possessing senses." But Paramātmā, while present in the heart of every jiva, remains situated in His own inher- ent being. He thus perceives or witnesses directly, without recourse to the material senses of the body-mind, and is hence called akarana. The living being is attached to his material senses, but Paramātmā is neither attached to nor dependent upon them. 
In the next anuccheda, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi will further explain that the Lord's senses are transcendental because they are different from the material senses.songs fibas 1set has abroad and baikan abang bosened to biousb bd or bina i sis

Therefore, Śri Brahma's boon to Hiranyakasipu that he would not be slain by various beings and weapons is also appropriate to con- sider in this regard. Hiranyakasipu asked, "Grant me that I not meet death from any animate or inanimate being, whether deva, asura or a great snake from the lower planets" (SB 7.3.37).2

The negation here is not of the instrument, but of the agent, the wielder of the instrument, because that is the context in which the verse was spoken. Secondly, the words "animate or inani- mate” apply strictly to the agent, or in other words, the would- be killer of Hiranyakasipu. In addition, the negation must be of the agent, since if it applied to the instrument, Hiranyakasipu would be susceptible to being killed even by an ordinary human being's nails, which are both living and non-living simultane- ously (a boon which Hiranyakasipu had not thought to ask for). A living being's nails are lifeless, despite being similar to the liv- ing body, since they grow out separately from the organism and can be clipped off.

The logical formulation is this: The Lord has a form, because, like a potter, He has agency, implying cognition, volition and endeavor. This form is eternal, just like His cognition and other attributes, because it is the sense, or the instrument, of the supremely potent eternal Entity (Iśvara). Therefore, it is categorically different from mortal forms.

The words jivan-śava (living corpse) mean that the material body is alive solely because of its connection with the conscious being, but of its own, is simply a corpse. The Lord's form, on the other hand, being conscious by nature, is always alive. The distinction between the two is thus proper. Furthermore, since His form is inherently eternal, blissful and conscious, the worship of His form is appropriate.

49 The Lord's Bodily Limbs Are Non-Material 
lolactulose, disano zis..or berillaldanovi TO FURTHER SUBSTANTIATE that "no hands or legs" indicates their transcendental counterparts, Śrila Jiva Gosvāmī cites a verse by Ruk- miņi Devi, Kṛṣṇa's principal and most affectionate queen in Dvārakā. One day, He decided to tease her and playfully spoke the following words: 30 109

O Rukmini, many kings were eager to marry you, all of whom are more opulent, handsome, generous and powerful than Me. Indeed, father betrothed you to Śiśupala, who is a great hero and was your mad to win your hand in marriage. You rejected all of them, how- ever, and chose to marry Me. Why did you make such a mistake? O beautiful one, don't you understand that I reside in the midst of the ocean out of fear for Jarasandha and other powerful enemies? 916 DEVE 
Most dear one, I am not qualified to be king, nor do I know how to behave with the cultured women of royal families. I am a pauper band loved only by those who are like Me. Those who have wealth and aristocratic birth generally avoid Me. Therefore, O princess of Bhismaka, you have made a severe blunder. You heard my so-called 408 glories from beggars who are devoted to Me, and owing to short- sightedness, you fell in love with Me. Still, it is not too late to rec- tify your mistake. You can still choose some suitable king as your husband.

Actually, I really abducted you only to curb the pride of Śalva and Siśupāla, who were envious of Me. Otherwise, I am quite indif- ferent, having no attraction or attachment for wife, children and wealth. (SB 10.60.10-20) 
Śrīmati Rukmini Devi was thoroughly upset to hear these pierc- ing words, the like of which she had never heard before from her affectionate and constant companion. Drowning in an ocean of sor- row, she fainted at the mere thought of being separated from Him. Seeing this, Śrī Kṛṣṇa was filled with compassion. He lifted her up, wiped the tears from her eyes, and consoled her, admitting that He had only been joking with her. After repeated reassurance, she was finally pacified. She then proceeded to speak a number of verses that

reveal the hidden meaning of Kṛṣṇa's statements, turning them in a favorable light. SB 10.60.45 is one verse in this series, where Rukmini indirectly indicates the transcendental nature of Bhagavan's form. 
Rukmini first presents a lucid description of the material body, which is dead though appearing alive. She asks how one can enjoy embracing a dead body, which is impure, filthy, abominable, untouchable and a source of fear. The only rasa, or taste, a sane per- son can relish from the material body is bibhatsa, the sentiment of disgust. The outer covering of skin may look attractive, but the inte- rior is filled with foul intestines, flesh wrapped around bones, all tied together with nerves and veins. The body is full of unsightly blood, worms, bile, stool, mucus and urine. Furthermore, it is always afflicted with various miseries, like boils, wounds, fever, cancer and so on. 
Rukmini Devi indicates that the limbs and body of Bhagavan are distinct from the material limbs being described here. Even His hair is sat-cit-ananda.

Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi cites the following verse in his Vaisnava-toşani commentary to paint a vivid picture of the material body's actual makeup: 
the warsh 
If the contents of the body were worn on the outside, one would con- tinuously spend his time warding off dogs and vultures with a stick. 
At certain times of the day, we get a glimpse of the foul nature of the contents of the body. So the question arises, how can a woman be attracted to a man's body, and vice versa? Rukmini Devi answers, känta, because she thinks him beautiful and lovable. 
A further doubt is raised. Everyone is exposed to the various foul odors emanating from the body, so how can it be considered beautiful? The answer is that it is due to pronounced bewilderment, vimuḍhāh. This condition is compared to the state of intoxication, under the influence of which, a man can take pleasure even in lying in the gutter.

not People who relish the fragrance of lotus flowers will abhor the stench of a dead body, whereas a crow considers it pleasant. In the same way, those who have tasted the nectarean pastimes of the Lord, or experienced the fragrance of His lotus feet, will abhor the fixation with enjoyment of the material body, which is a living corpse.

To corroborate this conclusion, Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī next alludes to the history of Hiranyakasipu, who performed great penances to please Śrī Brahma. When Śrī Brahma appeared before him, Hiranyakasipu offered him prayers in which he asked for many boons, including that he not be killed by any creature created by Brahma; that he not be killed inside or outside any residence, dur- ing the day or at night, in the sky, on earth or in water; that he not be killed by any weapon, and so on. In this way, Hiranyakaśipu requested boons with the intent of becoming immortal, attempting to cover all the possible sources of death. 
asbev adi tadi bozinoqu Amongst the kinds of beings he protected himself against, Hiranyakasipu included those "who have life-air (or vital-force) and those who do not have life-air" (vyasubhir väsumadbhir vā). Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmi says that with this statement, Hiranyakasipu intended to deny an agent with such characteristics, not an instrument. He requested not to be killed by any being that either breathes or does not breathe. He failed, however, to request not to be killed by a being who both breathes and doesn't breathe simultaneously. Such characteristics are present in the Trans-conventional being who breathes, but not in the way that ordinary human beings do. His

breath, like His body, senses, and so on, is an inherent manifestation of His essential nature.as 
madebod babb to danes 
If Hiranyakasipu's intention had been to deny, not the agent, but an instrument that is either living or non-living, then by his fail- ure to request protection from an instrument that is both living and non-living simultaneously, even an ordinary human being would be able to kill him with his nails and remain true to Śrī Brahma's boon. This is so because nails have no life-air in them as they are clippable, and yet they have life because they grow. No mortal being, however, would have been able to kill Hiranyakasipu, since it is clear that no mortal being could be an exception to his conditions. 
ble In spite of all his precautions, however, he was eventually killed by Lord Nrsimhadeva without Brahma's boons being flouted. The Lord killed him with His nails, which implies that His nails are non- different from Him, and therefore satisfy the condition of being both with and without life-air. The Lord's existence is not depen- dent on His breath, as is the case for human beings. Rather, His breath is an inherent and natural manifestation of His existence. Therefore, He alone fits the exception to the stringent criteria set by Hiranyakasipu.

This proves that the Lord's limbs are transcendental and a part of His svarupa-sakti. As such, the statement from Bṛhad-aranyaka Upanisad that the Vedas and Vedic literature appeared from the breath of the Supreme is neither false nor allegorical. Moreover, the Lord's body is not manifest by yogic power, but exists eternally, like Himself, and can never be separated from Him. It is not living due to contact with the Lord's ātmā, as is the case with the material body. It is pure consciousness and therefore worshipable. 
Finally, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi offers a logical proof that the Lord has a body, and that, furthermore, it is eternal and transcendental. The logical steps are given as follows: 
1. Proposition: Bhagavan must have form. art 
fold 
2. Reason: Because He is the creator, and a possessor of knowledge, 
will and the capacity for action. 
3. Universal proposition: Whoever creates must have a body, e.g., a 
potter.

This is the five-step syllogism of Vedic logic, called anumana. Cre- ative action indicates that an agent must have knowledge. Mere knowledge, however, is not sufficient. People may have various types of knowledge, but that does not mean they use it to create. The will to create must also be present, though that too is insufficient on its own; the creator must also have sufficient energy and the means to engage in the act of creation. Furthermore, there should be no insurmountable impediments during the process of doing so. When all these conditions are met, the work of creation can be carried out. 
Knowledge, will and working capacity are attributes and can only reside in a substantive, gunavattva-samaväyi-kāraṇatvaṁ dravyatvam. Knowledge cannot reside in inert matter, jñānād- hikaraṇam ātmā. The self is the substratum of knowledge; therefore, it is concluded that the Lord, who is the creator of the universe and has the knowledge, will and energy needed for creation, must be a conscious being. This in turn naturally infers that He must have a body. But His body could be material or spiritual. To prove that His body is spiritual, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi offers another logical phrasing: 
1. Proposition: Bhagavan's form is eternal. 
2. Reason: Because it is His instrument. 
3. Universal proposition: Whatever serves as Bhagavan's instru- 
ment, such as His knowledge, is eternal. 
4. Application: Bhagavan's body is His instrument in creation. 
5. Conclusion: Bhagavan's body is eternal. 
Nyaya is a realistic philosophy, and logicians accept that the Lord is eternal and real. Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī does not go into the details of logic here because it would be out of context. Interested read- ers may study Nyaya-kusumāñjali of Śrī Udayanācārya, wherein the author offers detailed logical proof for the existence of God. Because the Lord is eternal, all His attributes and instruments, such as His will, knowledge and action, are eternal. If His knowledge is eternal, then naturally its substratum is also eternal, as the attributes of an eternal substance are similarly eternal (nityam gataṁ nityam). 
495 
JAM Śri Bhagavat Sandarbhav 
bre According to logic, something is considered eternal if it is both without beginning (anadi) and end (ananta). This means that there was never a time when the Lord's body did not exist, nor will it ever cease to exist. In contrast to this, Rukmiņi Devi calls mortal beings "living corpses" (jivan-śava). This means that they are actually dead but appear to live owing to contact with the eternal spark of con- sciousness that is the living being. The Lord's body is not like that, as it is conscious by its very nature. This is the implication of the word jivan-śava, used in this verse. 
In the upcoming anuccheda, the author will reconcile mutually contradictory statements about the name and form of the Lord.

IN THE FOLLOWING VERSE, Śri Dakṣa sets forth the [transcenden- tal nature of the] Lord's name and form for the sake of those who argue amongst themselves over the Vedic statements that either deny or accept the Lord's name and form:

The system that affirms the existence (asti-iti) of names and forms in the Absolute is yoga. In this context, yoga refers to the scripture that prescribes worship of the Absolute through gross or visible form. The descriptions of the Lord's names and forms in

this system include the names of all things, such as a pot or a cloth, and also all forms, such as the Pātāla planet, which is considered to be His feet. The yoga system affirms worship through material form because of the ease with which one can contemplate objects that have already been seen. 
नास्तीति साङ्ख्यं ज्ञानशास्त्रम् । तत्र हि निषेधश्रुतिभिस्तस्य नामरूपित्वं यन् निषिध्यते तत् प्रापञ्चिकनामरूपित्वस्य कल्पितत्वात् सर्वथैव नास्तीति निश्चीयते । 
stroD 
The system that negates the existence (năsti-iti) of attributes in the Absolute is sänkhya or the jñāna-śästra. In this system, the Absolute is denied name and form, using the negative statements of the Vedas. Because the names and forms in this material world are mere thought constructs, it is concluded that the Absolute has no names and forms whatsoever. -nabassan

A doubt is raised: Why not assume that these two systems describe different entities? That is not true, for the verse says, “One and the same Entity for both” (eka-sthayoh ). In the mat- ter of such controversy, whatever Entity is perceived (avekṣita) by the disputants as being the synthesis (sama) of their particu- lar view, that same Entity, though perceived in opposing ways, will be viewed by both onlookers as great (bṛhat) and favorable (anuküla) to their own specific outlook. What is the nature of that Entity in which such synthesis is found? It is para (transcenden- tal), which is to say that it is completely beyond material name and form, as well as beyond their total absence; wherein it is pos- sible to say that it both does and does not have name and form simultaneously. This means that such a distinct Entity would certainly be inclusive of name and form. ad ba

It may be suggested that if the affirmative and negative state- ments of the Śrutis regarding name and form apply equally to the same Entity, that would make them self-contradictory. But because both perspectives accept that Entity as transcen- dental, then by the above stated reasoning, a synthesis can be arrived at by considering His name and form as being beyond material nature. This synthesis is established through [under- standing] the actual import of both the positive and negative statements of the Śrutis. Thus, any contention between the two systems is merely apparent. Dhruva Mahārāja also speaks of this reconciliation in the same manner:

In this verse, the word rupa (form) refers to the Lord's body, char- acterized by features such as four hands, and which is simul- taneously "beyond all this." That this is so is concluded from the fact that such an Entity meets the criteria of the Absolute both through affirmation and negation of name and form. Fur- thermore, that the Absolute is an Entity both inclusive of tran- scendental form and beyond material form is also confirmed by this statement from Visnu Purāṇa, "O King, He is both with and without form; He is both transcendental and phenomenal [...]" (VP 6.7.47). This will be demonstrated later on. The phrase, "I do not know" (nāvedmi) means, "I did not know until now."

such an Entity. This is logically inconsistent. Nevertheless, in this section, Jīva Gosvāmi shows how both these types of Vedic state- ments describe one and the same Entity, Bhagavan, in whom the two apparently opposing views find resolution. To accomplish this, Jiva Gosvāmi refers to two verses from Dakṣa's Hamsa-guhya prayers in the Sixth Canto. 
The ten sons of King Präcinabarhi, known as the Pracetas, per- formed austerities under the ocean for an extended period. When they emerged, they were incensed to see the earth overrun by tall trees; in anger they ignited the trees with fire and wind generated from their mouths. The presiding deity of the trees, the moon-god, pacified the Pracetas by offering them Pramlocă Apsara's beautiful daughter, named Vārkṣī, in marriage. Their son was Dakṣa Mahā- rāja, who later went to a holy place, called Aghamarṣaṇa, to perform severe penances as a preparation for his work of procreation. There he recited the Hamsa-guhya-stotra for the glorification of Śrī Viṣṇu. 
In the first of the two verses under discussion in this anuccheda, Dakṣa reconciles the apparent contradiction between the teachings of yoga and those of sankhya? The word yoga, according to Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī, here refers to the upāsanā-bhakti scriptures, which pre- scribe that neophytes should meditate on the cosmic form of the Lord. A neophyte refers to someone who is oriented to gross form and is not yet attuned to the Spirit that underlies and pervades all form. It is difficult for such people to conceive of the Lord's spiri- tual form. By the principle that the very item that causes a disease can also cure it, such people are advised to meditate on material names and forms, as being the names and forms of the Lord. In this way, they learn to "re-cognize" the Lord in everything, and their con- sciousness becomes attuned to a more profound reality. Śrī Suka- deva describes this process to Parikṣit Mahārāja in the Second Canto: 
"In this context, yoga and sänkhya do not refer to the two schools of philosophy that are counted among the six Indian darśanas. Rather, they should be thought of as generic approaches to spiritual truth, as indicated in GITA 3.3. They are general approaches, stressing either the imminence or transcendence of the Absolute, rather than specifically formulated systems.

aid Having mastered the sitting posture and the breath, remaining iso-u 91-lated from company and controlling the senses, one should use the 92 
intelligence to fix the mind on the Lord's gross form, which is called in the viraḍ-rupa. This special body of the Lord is the grossest of the 21 gross, in which the past, present and future of the existing universe is manifested. Within this body - the universal shell covered by the sevenfold material elements - resides the universal form of the Lord, the basis of all meditation. (SB 2.1.23-25) 
llet After this, Sukadeva explains how one should meditate on the various planetary systems, beginning from Pātālaloka, which is con- sidered to be the sole of the Lord's foot. In this way, the yoga-sastra affirms the worship of the Absolute through material names and forms. But these are not the real names and forms of the Lord. queb 
Sänkhya-sastra, however, deny name and form in the Absolute. Sänkhya means knowledge, "That which properly defines or explains is called sänkhya" (samyak khyāyate iti sänkhyah). This refers to the path of jñāna-yoga, which is based on the process of ascertaining the Absolute Truth through negation, neti neti, "not this, not this." 
While teaching Gärgi, the sage Yajnavalkya said, "Brahman is without name, ears, mind or organ of speech" (acakṣuşkam asrotram avag amanas, BAU 3.8.8). This process of negation concludes that Brahman is beyond the visible material world. Since it denies Brah- man all material qualities, it simply hints that He has transcenden- tal features. That is the actual purpose of the denial, though the negation is interpreted in absolutistic terms by those who cling to formlessness as a conception. 
Through the system of yoga, attention is disciplined to constantly remember the Lord by perceiving all material elements as parts of His universal body. When the yogi advances, however, he medi- tates directly on Paramātmā within his heart. Through the sankhya

approach, one is trained to constantly think of the Absolute as tran- scending all material objects perceived by the senses. Sānkhya phi- losophy holds that the Absolute cannot have material name, form or qualities, and thus encourages one to fix the mind on the Absolute Truth devoid of limitations and qualifiers.tolime 
Both approaches are, in fact, directed toward the same goal, since both describe, and encourage remembrance of, One and the same Entity. Thus, there is no contradiction between the affirming process of yoga (asti-iti) and the negating process of sänkhya (nāsti- iti). So, the word avekṣita (appears) means the way the Absolute is perceived, by the respective schools, after thorough analysis; and anukulam (favorable to the understanding of both) means that the two positions are accommodated and thus reconciled within the same Entity. for al 
vo In the Second Canto, Śrī Suka says that yogis reject gross and subtle material forms to meditate on the Lord:

Regarding the process of neti neti, Śrī Śuka elsewhere says: 
Since they intend to set aside everything that is not the Absolute Truth, by following the process of negation (neti neti), the transcen- em dentalists give up all misconceptions of the self. Constantly embrac-q 
qsing the Lord's form within their heart and having no friend other athan Him, they know that He, Śrī Visnu, is the supreme destination.

Since the goal of both paths is the same, there is no contradic- tion between them, only the means taken is different. One cannot envision the universal form without accepting the substratum, just

as one cannot paint a picture without a canvas. Imagination needs a basis in reality (sati kudye citram nyayaḥ). One sees water in a mirage only because he is familiar with the real substance; one can imagine horns on a rabbit because he has experienced both independently. Similarly, one can imagine the universal form of the Lord, because the universe and the Lord's form exist separately as tangible realities. In the same way, the process of negation has both a basis and a limit. For example, suppose twenty students, one of whom is Kṛṣṇadāsa, are sitting in a row. Someone is looking for him and so points to the first student and asks, "Is this Kṛṣṇadāsa?" The teacher replies, "Not him, not him." The same question is posed of the next student, and again the teacher replies, "Not him, not him." This process is repeated until the investigator finds Kṛṣṇadāsa. The process of neti neti is thus only limited or relative negation; it is not absolute, since the negation is no longer applicable when the actual entity is discov- ered. With regard to the question at hand, its purpose is simply to deny that the Lord has material qualities. 
Moreover, according to Vedic logic, one cannot deny something that does not exist, aprasiddha-pratiyogino'bhavo manyante naiva tärkikāḥ. If something has never existed, does not exist at present, and will never exist in the future, then one cannot say anything about it. Hence, denial of the Lord's name and form is not absolute, but refers only to certain names and forms, because even to deny His name and form implies that names and forms do exist somewhere. 
Bhagavan is the source of all names and forms, aham sarvasya prabhavaḥ (GITA 10.8). As such, He must also have names and forms. Thus, there are Vedic mantras that simultaneously deny and accept qualities in the Lord, such as in śu 6.11, "He is the witness, the bestower of intelligence, the Absolute and yet, He is devoid of qual- ities." And in Bhagavad Gita, Śrī Kṛṣṇa confirms that there is no conflict between sänkhya and yoga:

12 One who knows that the state reached by means of sankhya can also be attained by yoga, and therefore sees both approaches as one and the same, sees things as they really are. (GĪTĀ 5.5)13

Dakṣa had referred to both of these approaches earlier in verses SB 6.4.28-29. First he said that all names and forms belong to the Lord (following the yoga approach), and then that all names and forms perceived by the senses, including the mind, are products of māyā (following the sankhya approach). Since the Lord has names and forms that are not produced by māyā, it must mean that they are manifestations of His svarupa-sakti. 9 
After expressing these seemingly irreconcilable attitudes, Dakṣa then resolves them in the verse under discussion by stating that the Lord's name and form are para, transcendental. This means that the Lord's name and form are different both from those accepted by the followers of yoga (those related to the Lord's material universal form) and those rejected by the followers of sänkhya.

The One who is devoid of name and form has assumed (bheje), i.e., revealed, His name and form. He has manifested them along with His birth and pastimes.5 Should He not have done so, that itself would have been a flaw or shortcoming. Thus, Dakṣa says that He is unlimited (ananta); if He was devoid of name, form and so on, then limits would have been imposed on His omnipotence. So, the Pracetas sang, "There is no end to Your glories, and so You are called unlimited, ananta" (SB 4.30.31).16

The cause behind this manifestation [of His names and forms] is that He is Bhagavan, the complete personal nondual Whole, endowed with inherent potencies in the form of opulences. His power is not a product of māyā, and thus the verse refers to Him as "the Transcendental One" (parama). Here parama should [fur- ther] be understood as "the One in whom Lakṣmi (Mã, the per- sonification of transcendental energy called pară, resides." The import is that if such transcendental potencies were not inher- ent in Him, He could not be called parama (transcendental). So it is said:

A doubt is raised: The only evidence of whether the Absolute has all names and possesses a universal form, or is devoid of them, is deduced from the fact that there are respective worshipers of these two features. But who are these people who testify in this way?

In response, Dakṣa said, "To bless those who worship His lotus feet." Absolute Reality does not become completely manifest to those who adopt the processes of yoga or sankhya, but does through the process of devotion. This is confirmed by the Śruti, "Only bhakti leads to Him, only bhakti reveals Him."18 So, the overall idea is that it is justified to say that their dispute is merely apparent.

He is unlimits 
The word "feet" in the phrase, "those who worship His lotus feet" (pada-mülam bhajatām), implies that the Lord's form existed even before He manifested it to them. As the Śruti says, "His primeval lotus foot spread around."20 The past tense in the verb bheje ("assumed," i.e., revealed) strengthens the above conclu- sion and indicates that His name and form are beginningless. The term ananta (unlimited) also implies that His name and form are unlimited. Śrīdhara Svāmī similarly comments here, "Although devoid of material name and form [...].” 
Commentary 
In the next verse (SB 6.4.33) of this anuccheda, Dakṣa confirms the conclusions he expressed in his preceding statement. He says that the Lord is devoid of material name and form (anama-rupa) but man- ifests transcendental name and form out of mercy for His devotees. 
The Lord does not have a name in the ordinary sense, as a mere referent or designation, and so He is called anāmā. In the material world, a person is different from his name. Thus, a blind man may be named Padmalocana (lotus-eyed). But the Lord and His Name are nondifferent. 
Anāmā can also mean that no mortal can exhibit the power of the Lord's name. For example, the Lord is called Mukunda (the giver of liberation), or Madanamohana (one who captivates Cupid by His beauty). Though a mortal can be designated by such names, he can- not fulfill their meaning. Only the Lord can do so. 
Furthermore, the Lord is called Ananta, unlimited. If it is argued that He cannot have name and form, since material names and forms are limitations, that denial is itself an imposition of limitation on 
20 caranam pavitram vitatam purāṇam 
508 
50 Contradictory Statements Reconciled 
Him. Ironically, this restriction is unwittingly imposed in the very attempt to defend the Absolute from all such limitations. If this per- spective is followed to its logical conclusion, then the Absolute could not truly be said to be unlimited. By the same logic, however, if one argues that He cannot be denied names and forms, this too imposes another limitation. His name Ananta therefore implies that He both possesses and yet does not possess name and form. No one can limit Him, either positively or negatively. He is thus rightly called Bhagavan, the master of unlimited inconceivable opulences. 
This fact can be properly understood only by devotees, or in other words, by worshipers of the complete personal nondual Whole, in which all such contradictions are harmonized. It is beyond the understanding of the adherents of the yoga and sankhya approaches. Therefore, Dhruva Mahārāja said that everything is properly reconciled in the personhood of the Lord, which is the highest manifestation of the Absolute - nataḥ param parama vedmi na yatra vādaḥ. 
In the next anuccheda, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī will relate Brahma's experience of the form of the Lord, as given in the Third Canto.

IN THIS WAY IT HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED that the form of the Lord is indeed the Supreme Absolute Truth because it is eternal, all- pervading, the shelter of everything, distinct from all gross and subtle material objects, beyond sense perception, self-luminous, and that in which all the statements of the Śrutis find reconcilia- tion. This was experienced by the most wise Brahma, who clearly described Bhagavan's form in the following three verses: 
रूपं यदेतदवबोधरसोदयेन शश्वन्निवृत्ततमसः सदनुग्रहाय 
आदौ गृहीतमवतारशतैकबीजं यन्नाभिपद्मभवनादहमाविरासम् ॥ २४१ ||

"In answer, Brahma speaks the following two verses: 'Ignorance is permanently absent from You, through the upsurge of taste in the form of knowing' (avabodha-rasodayena), i.e., by the presence of Your conscious potency (cit-śakti). 'You have assumed (grhita) this form,' meaning, 'You have manifested it by Your independent will for the purpose of blessing the true' (sad-anugrahāya), i.e., Your worshipers. This form is the sole fountainhead of hundreds of other avataras, which are all situated in pure being (viśuddha- sattva). To illustrate this, Brahma shows that this form is the source of the guṇāvatāras by the phrase, 'I myself have appeared from its lotus navel, which is my home.'

leading to the unmanifest" (avyakta-vartmanyabhivesitātmā, SB 3.8.33). In Śrīdhara Svāmi's phrasing of the objection, "Why do some people not honor Me?" the pronoun "Me" implies the Abso- lute specifically as endowed with form, since the Absolute inher- ently self-endowed with form (vigrahi) has been established as Parabrahman. Therefore, those who do not accept the form of the Lord in this way contradict the experience of realized beings and fail to recognize the Lord. So, Śrīdhara Svāmi says they are influ- enced by inherently defective logic that fails to accommodate the Absolute as personal God (nirisvara-kutarka-niṣṭhāḥ).

the superiority of the devotees whose faith-vision (niṣṭhā) is reposited in the Absolute as Bhagavan, endowed with transcen- dental form. The basis of their superiority is both theoretical (i.e., scriptural) and experiential, as indicated by two adjecti- val phrases: the words śruti-väta-nita (carried by the breezes of revealed sound) mean that they have arrived at this under- standing of the Absolute on the authority of Vedic revelation (sabda-pramāṇa). Furthermore, the words grhita-carana (they hold those feet), mean that they have directly witnessed, expe- rienced and realized the Absolute as Bhagavan, replete with transcendental form. dwman not lenigno dialysis said

Baus or 2 a abriady how aids mi ai IN THE PREVIOUS FEW SECTIONS, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī has established that the Lord's form is eternal and transcendental. He substantiates this here by referring to the experience of Śrī Brahma, one of the twelve authorities (mahajanas) on the complete Absolute, known as Bhagavan. Brahma recited these verses in glorification of Śrī Nārā- yana at the dawn of creation. Being eager to create, yet uncertain of how to proceed, he prayed to the Supreme Lord, the abode of all knowledge. In this world, everyone is imperfect and must depend on others even for material knowledge. Brahma knew this very well: without faith in the scriptures and in the sages who have directly realized them, nobody can approach the Absolute Truth. 
In these prayers, Brahma declares that the Lord's form is the Absolute Truth, and that there is nothing beyond it. There cannot be two Absolute Truths. Therefore, the Lord and His body cannot be independent of each other. Furthermore, Brahmā singles out that very form present directly before him (etad rupam). 21H bne brol 
The word nistha is generally translated as faith or fixity. Yet faith or fixity in the Absolute as Bhagavan does not imply mere strength of belief. Nistha actually refers to a state of consciousness involving pronounced realization of the said Reality. The faith co-existent with such direct apprehension may thus be referred to as faith-vision.

in Śrī Bhagavat Sandarbha 
The Lord's form is a manifestation of avabodha-rasa (the taste of knowledge), or pure consciousness, and is thus eternally free from ignorance. The word ignorance (tamas) implies the presence of the other two gunas and their source, pradhana. This is because the gunas are always interconnected, and thus the absence or presence of any one of them indicates the absence or presence of the others. The bod- ies of mortal beings, including Brahma's, are made of matter, which is temporary and full of ignorance. 
(agmorgenhdna) 
Brahma next says that the form he sees is the source of hundreds of avataras, comparing it to a seed, bija. This indicates that the Abso- lute Reality is the original form from which all other forms appear, in the same way that a single seed is the source of a tree with numer- ous branches and fruits, which contain many other seeds in turn. The tree is a manifestation of the seed and thus nondifferent from it. In this world, the rule is that the seed itself is transformed into a tree, but this transcendental seed remains intact even after giving rise to the tree. In Brahma-samhita, Śrī Brahma offers the example of multiple candles being lit from a single candle: 1919 yd not bud

When the flame of one lamp is transferred from one wick to another, the second lamp burns separate from the original source, but nis remains the same in all characteristics. I adore the primeval Lord Is Govinda who, in the same manner, manifests Himself in the various to breforms of Viṣṇu. (Brahma-samhita 5.46) blow.eider 
worl Amdera sgbalwond laristam o nove do no In the second verse of this section (SB 3.9.3), Brahma explicitly states that he does not consider the Lord's form and His essen- tial nature (svarupa) to be different. He uses three adjectives to describe this svarupa, and thereby establishes the Lord's distinctive transcendental nature. 
brod sili solare di tuload owad The first adjective, ananda-matra (pure bliss), signifies that the Lord and His form are absolutely free from the gunas of nature, which are the sources of misery. Although He is the source of the universe, the universal elements do not exist in His transcendental body. The Lord is both the material as well as the efficient cause, 
diparcir eva hi daśäntaram abhyupetya dipayate vivṛta-hetu-samana-dharma yas tādṛg eva hi ca viṣṇutaya vibhāti govindam ādi-puruşam tam aham bhajami 
516 
51 The Lord's Form Is the Supreme Absolute Reality 
and yet He is essentially distinct from them. Just as a person mak- ing sweets is different from them, the Lord is different from His creation. He is the cause of all causes, yet He is aloof. Generally, material causes transform themselves into their effects - like milk turning into yogurt. The Lord is unlike such material causes because His eternal body does not undergo any transformation from the act of creating. 
How l 
The Lord is like touchstone that transforms iron into gold while remaining unchanged, or like a magnet, which can magnetize a piece of iron without itself being affected. The Lord creates the universe from pradhana, but modifications in pradhana do not affect His form or personality because He is eternally parama, or transcendental. 
The second adjective is avikalpa (undifferentiated). The Lord is unlike pradhana, which transforms into many categories of ele- ments, such as mahat (the cosmic intellect), material ego, the senses, sense objects and the material elements. These elements contain some specific qualities not observed in mahat. This gives rise to dual- ity. There is no such duality in the form of the Lord. Unlike empiric duality, which is the cause of misery, there is no tinge of misery to be found in the Supreme Lord. He is thus ananda-matra, and completely free from duality, avikalpa. 
The divisions (vikalpa) of names and forms in this material world are temporary and cause illusion to the living being. Because the Lord is unadulterated bliss (ananda-matra) and without any mate- rial divisions (avikalpa), He is self-luminous, aviddha-varca, the third adjective used to describes the Lord's nature. This quality means that He can be known only by His mercy. The material mind and senses cannot comprehend Him. Self-luminous also means that He is purely conscious. Thus, although He is the source of the universe, He is not the universe. 
Worship of the Lord's form is therefore appropriate because it possesses the above characteristics, which distinguish it from the material body. Moreover, it is the source of all auspiciousness. In Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu, Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī defines auspiciousness in the following terms: 
517 
villŚri Bhagavat Sandarbha Chi 
According to the wise, auspiciousness means to be pleasing to the whole cosmos, to be loved by everyone, to be endowed with all goodni wil qualities, and to be content. (BRS 1.1.27) da arall olg 
The Lord is certainly the shelter of all auspiciousness, as Śrī Yudhisthira Mahārāja remarks: 
For the welfare, prosperity and general well-being of all the worlds, the Original Person, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, is present in the ocean of the Yadava family, accompanied by His constant companion, Ananta or [Balarama]. Respected by all, the Yadavas revel, like the attendants Ja of Śrī Visņu, in their own city of Dvaraka, which is protected by His to long arms. (SB 1.14.35-36)55d 
In reality, auspiciousness means to progress on the path of tran- scendence. All other so-called progress is mere phantasmagoria, like the water of a mirage. The purpose of human life is to awaken to spiritual truth. All other pursuits are temporary and ultimately lead to misery. Prahlada Mahārāja compared sensual gratification to the itching sensation, which provides initial relief but eventually aggra- vates the pain. After all, itching is a dis-ease, and no sane person considers dis-ease as a legitimate source of pleasure. 
But as Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the spiritual teacher of the whole cosmos and the source of transcendental knowledge, He is all-auspicious and thus Brahma takes shelter of Him. By taking shelter of the Lord, the devotees also become auspicious. By their mercy, the ignorance of the conditioned beings is removed, and auspiciousness is infused into their unfulfilling lives. 
Even so, there is a class of people who disrespect the Lord owing to association of the untrue, asat-prasangaḥ, whose reductionistic and hence defective logic fails to accommodate the Absolute as per- sonal God. Owing to this defect, such persons are said to be suitable 
subhani prinanam sarva-jagatam anuraktată!

candidates for facing the lord of death and judgment, Yamarāja, naraka-bhāk. Those who hold to such misperception include the atheists, who decry the existence of the Lord, and the radical Advaita philosophers, who teach that the Lord's body as well as the universe are mithya, or illusory. Association is the fundamental cause behind one's upliftment or downfall. Canakya Pandita thus advises: 
Give up the association of miscreants and keep the company of the true. Perform pious works throughout both day and night, and remember the temporary nature of this body and the material world. (Canakya-nīti 14.2)10 
The devotees experience the flavor of the Lord's pastimes with their ears. Revealed sound is compared to a pleasant breeze that per- vades every direction, carrying the fragrance of the Lord's glorious pastimes. Just as fragrance pervades the air, sound vibrations travel through the ether. 
Because the devotees never leave the lotus feet of the Lord, he never abandons the lotus-like hearts of His devotees. The phrase śruti-vāta (breeze of revealed sound) also indicates that the Lord can be known only through śabda-pramaņa, in the same way that smell can be perceived only when carried by the air. Asat-prasangāḥ (those influenced by the company of the untrue) refers to those who do not acknowledge the Vedic authority because of adopting an inherently reductionistic or defective logical perspective on what constitutes reality. 
Among the various types of sabda-pramāņas, Śrīmad Bhagavatam is supreme, and Śrī Brahma was the first to hear it. Brahma boldly accepted the form of the Lord as transcendental and nondifferent from Him, and he denounces all who stand in opposition to this con- clusion. Those who embrace Brahma's vision are truly learned, in the sense of having assimilated the complete, unlimited Reality, they are qualified to understand the Lord and His form in the way that Śrī Brahma did. Not only do the Lord's sväṁśa-līlāvatāras (viṣṇu-tattva) have transcendental bodies, but even the body of an aveśāvatāra, like

Śrī Ṛṣabhadeva's Body Is Transcendental or

awo

IN THE SAME WAY, the body of Śrī Rṣabhadeva, who appeared as an äveśāvatāra, is to be understood as transcendental. As Śrī Rṣabhadeva told His sons: 
bigol 
bss 
इदं शरीरं मम दुर्विभाव्यं सत्त्वं हि मे हृदयं यत्र धर्मः । 
पृष्ठे कृतो मे यदधर्म आरादतो हि मामृषभं प्राहुरार्याः । २४५ ।। । 
This body is an inconceivable reality. Religion (dharma) is situ- ated in My heart and irreligion behind My back. Therefore, those highly cultured in wisdom teachings call Me Rsṣabha, the most exalted. (SB 5.5.19)1 
इदं मनुष्याकारशरीरं हि निश्चितं दुर्विभाव्यं दुर्वितर्क्यं यत्तत्त्वं तदेव । यत्रैव धर्मो भागव- तलक्षणस्तत्रैव मे हृदयं मनः । यद् यस्मात् तद् विपरीतादिलक्षणोऽधर्मो मया पृष्ठे कृतः । ततः पराङ्गुखोऽहमित्यर्थः । 
hammed bar bull 
Rṣabhadeva is saying, "This human-like body of Mine is certainly that very Reality (tattvam) which is inconceivable (durvibhāvya), meaning that it is beyond the conventional reasoning faculty. Wherever there is dharma, characterized by pure devotion to the complete Reality, Bhagavan, that is where My heart dwells, or

in other words, where My mind resides. This is because I keep everything that is contrary to dharma, i.e., irreligion, behind My back. In other words, I am ill-disposed towards irreligion." 
अत एव वक्तुरस्य ऋषभदेवस्य च सर्वान्तिमलीलापि व्याजेनान्तर्धानमेव प्राकृतलोकप्र- तीत्यनुसारेणैव तु तथा वर्णितम् । आत्मारामतारीतिदर्शनार्थम् । तदुक्तम् “योगिनां साम्प- रायविधिमनुशिक्षयन्” (भा० ५।६।६) इति । 
Therefore, the concluding pastime of Śrī Rṣabhadeva, the speaker of this verse, is actually His disappearance, although it is described in a way that accords with the experience of ordinary human beings. The story is depicted in this way specifically to illustrate the behavior of the atmarama, or the self-situated sage. This is stated as follows, "He adopted this behavior just to teach yogis how to give up the body" (SB 5.6.6). 
अतः “स्वकलेवरं जिहासुः” इत्यत्र कलेवरशब्दस्य प्रपञ्च एवार्थः । उपासनाशास्त्रे तस्य तथा प्रसिद्धेः । 
Therefore, in the statement, "desiring to give up His body" [found in the same prose section], the word kalevara (body) really means the material world, since the word kalevara is widely recognized in this sense in texts related to worship (upāsanā-śästra). 
तथा “अथ समीरवेगविधूतवेणुविकर्षणजातोग्रदावानलस्तद् वनमालेलिहानः सह तेन ददाह” (भा०५।६।८) इत्यस्य वास्तवार्थे तु तेन सहेति कर्तृसाहाय्ये तृतीया । गौणमु- ख्यन्यायेन कर्तर्येव प्राथमिकप्रवृत्तेः । ततश्च दावानलस्तद्वनवर्तितर्वादिजीवानां स्थूलं देहं ददाह । ऋषभदेवस्तु सूक्ष्मं देहमिति तस्य सर्वमोक्षदत्वमनुसन्धेयम् । भा० ९ । ११ ।२२- 
Similarly, in a subsequent text we find the following statement, "The blazing forest fire, generated by bamboo shoots rubbing against each other amidst strong winds, engulfed and burned the forest, along with Him" (SB 5.6.8). The real meaning of this description can be understood by taking the instrumental case in the phrase tena saha (along with Him) as having the sense of assisting the agent, [which would yield the following, "The fire, 
2 yoginām sämparaya-vidhim anusikşayan 
3 atha samira-vega-vidhūta-veņu-vikarṣaṇa-jätogra-dāvānalas tad vanam alelihānaḥ 
saha tena dadaha da 
522 
52 Śrī Ṛṣabhadeva's Body Is Transcendental 
along with Him, burned the forest," meaning that He assisted the fire in doing so]. This is appropriate here, since by the rule that the primary agent takes precedence over the secondary agent (gauna-mukhya-nyaya), the primary agent [in this case, the fire] is to be considered first. As such, the meaning is that the forest fire burnt the gross bodies of the trees and other living beings existing in the forest, but Śrī Rṣabhadeva burnt their subtle bod- ies. In this way, one should take note of his ability to liberate them all. This event is similar to Lord Rama's disappearance:

यैः स्पृष्टोऽभिदृष्टो वा संविष्टोऽनुगतोऽपि वा ।

The residents of Ayodhya, who saw, sat with, followed or touched Him [Lord Rama], went to that abode attained by the yogis. (SB 9.11.22)5

By describing Rṣabhadeva as having qualities in common with fire, it is also implied that He became invisible [and did not leave His body]. Therefore, the Third Chapter is entitled "The Appear- ance of Śrī Ṛṣabhadeva," and not "The Birth of Sri Rṣabhadeva."

Commentary

Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī defines an aveśāvatāra in the following verse: A Stochel hind to brod et suo

Śrī Bhagavat Sandarbha 
When Śrī Kṛṣṇa pervades a living being with a portion of His opu-ols lence, such as energy or knowledge, such a great soul is called an Nāvesa. 
āveśa. (LBH 1.17)6 
laga maning 
There are two categories of äveśāvatāras - bhagavad-aveśā- vatāra, pervasion as the Lord directly, and bhagavat-śakti-aveśa- avatāra, pervasion as an upholder of one of the Lord's potencies. The first type of pervasion induces the living being to identify himself directly as the Lord. The second type of pervasion induces the living being to identify himself as a devotee, and an upholder of the Lord's potency. Śrī Ṛṣabhadeva is an example of bhagavad-āveśāvatāra, as He Himself says: 
The Therefore, unless one has love for Me, Śrī Vasudeva, he is certainly yay not delivered from the bondage of this material body. (SB 5.5.6)" 
Examples of bhagavat-śakti-aveśa-avatāras are Śrī Nārada Muni and the four Kumāras. All āveśāvatāras are living beings, but they are invested with a special power of the Lord. 
Śrī Rṣabhadeva appeared as the son of King Nabhi and Meru- devi. Of His one hundred sons, Bharata Mahārāja was the eldest and, owing to his glories, India was named Bharatavarṣa after him. Nine of his younger brothers became the renounced paramahamsas known as the Navayogendras.

After ruling His kingdom for many years, when Śrī Rṣabha decided to renounce all worldly duties and retire to a life of medita- tion in the forest, He gathered His one hundred sons in an assembly of great sages and instructed them in transcendental knowledge. The verse under discussion is found amongst these teachings. In the verse preceding it, Rṣabha emphasized the importance of self- realization, which is rooted in service to the Lord and His devotees, and here He explains to His sons that they need not go far to search out the Lord, for their father was the Lord Himself. Later on, He 
"jñāna-śaktyädikalaya yatrāvisto janardanaḥ

instructs His sons to serve their elder brother, Bharata Mahārāja, who was a great devotee. By doing so, He demonstrated that service to His devotees is service to Him. nor do nove bodasorigad 
Śrī Rṣabha explains that His body is nondifferent from the Abso- lute Truth and thus inconceivable to mundane logic. One can con- ceive of a form made of material elements, but not one made of pure consciousness. Indeed, it is difficult to conceive of a form made of anything other than earth, water and fire. The subtle elements also have form, but it is not possible to perceive them with the gross eyes. Yogis, however, can even perceive atoms. Śrī Viśvanatha Pañcānana states in Bhāṣā-pariccheda: 9" omdie brow s 
brow 15. 
es 
A yogi who has attained the goal of yoga (yukta) is at all times able to see everything, such as the atoms present in ether, through his mind by the power of yoga. (Bhāṣa-pariccheda 65) 
The inconceivable nature of the Lord's form indicates that it is not a product of karma. His form results from His own free will. Such is not the case with ordinary living beings, who are thus unable to comprehend how any form can be the Absolute Reality. 
When the Lord says that His form is absolute, or when He calls Himself Vasudeva, the supreme goal of life, He does not do so out of pride. His purpose is to instruct His sons and, through them, humankind in general. It is out of compassion that He reveals these secrets to conditioned living beings. 
The Lord says that religion resides in His heart and irreligion far away, behind His back. This means that He can be understood only through dharma, by which He means bhakti, or worship of the complete Whole, Bhagavan. All other processes are either partial or material. Partial processes, such as jñāna, are those directed toward a less complete, or less inclusive, aspect of the complete Reality, such as Brahman. Material processes, such as yoga, are those that make use of gross form in an attempt to extricate themselves from gross form. Only bhakti is purely transcendental, being directed toward the complete Whole and being comprised exclusively of the

internal potency of Bhagavan, characterized by being, awareness and bliss. For the irreligious, the Lord is very far away and cannot be approached even by the mind. Indeed, non-devotees can never approach Him, even through the processes of jñana and yoga. Śrī Brahma confirms this: 
He 
I worship Govinda, the Original Person, only the tip of whose toes is attained by the greatest of sages, who may follow either the paths of controlling the breath or the mind for hundreds of millions of years, for He is the supreme inconceivable truth. (Brahma-samṁhitā 5.34) 
word story 
The word rṣabha means "the best." When words like ṛṣabha, vyäghra, śärdula, simha, pungava, etc., are affixed to another word, they endow it with the superlative sense. Thus, purușa-vyāghra (lit., "tiger amongst men") means "the best of men." Since the Lord is the best of everything, He is simply called Rṣabha (the most exalted). This is the opinion of aryas, or those highly cultured in wisdom teachings. Alternatively, the word arya in this verse refers to His father who named Him, and the plural is used out of respect for him. Śrī Suka said: 
When the child's father, Mahārāja Nābhi, saw the baby's body, dec- orated with qualities that are praised by poets, such as vitality, strength, beauty, glory, courage and valor, he gave him the name Rṣabha. (SB 5.4.2) 10 orang

An objection may be raised regarding the statement that Śrī Rṣa- bhadeva's body is transcendental. In chapter 5 of the Fifth Canto, Śukadeva Gosvāmī describes how Rṣabha took to renounced life after instructing His sons and installing Bharata Mahārāja on the throne. Abandoning all codes of social conduct, He followed the path of an avadhuta, not even wearing clothes or making any effort for His own maintenance. Such a discipline requires full absorption

in transcendental awareness, to the degree that one no longer pays attention to the body. It cannot be done artificially. According to the Mahā-nirvāṇa-tantra, there are four types of avadhūtas, the best of which is called hamsa, whose activities are described below: 
with? 
A hamsa should not possess anything and never associate with women. He should wander, surviving on whatever comes his way by the will of providence, and remain free from all rules and regulations." 
Jonge viabnos 
Śrī Ṛṣabhadeva called Himself hamsa (SB 5.5.10) and accepted such a lifestyle:

In the garb of an avadhuta, Śrī Ṛṣabhadeva appeared like a fool, a blind, deaf and dumb man, either possessed or mad. Though people mocked Him by calling Him such names, He kept a vow of silence and said nothing. (SB 5.5.29)12

Rṣabhadeva wandered throughout India. When He arrived near Kuṭakacala in the present state of Karnataka, he entered the jun- gle. Naked and His hair disheveled like a madman, He meandered through the forest, which suddenly burst into flames:

lottem ton af yb 
In Bhagavad Gita, Kṛṣṇa says that even the atomic ātmā cannot be burnt, so how is it that Rṣabha's transcendental body was? Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi says that careful analysis of this text reveals that Rṣa- bhadeva's body was not burnt in the forest fire. The phrase saha tena dadaha (burnt [...] along with Him) does not mean that the fire burnt the trees along with Rṣabhadeva, although that is the immedi- ate sense of the words. According to Śrī Jīva, it actually means that "haṁso na kuryāt stri-sangam na vidhatte parigraham

letsbaŚrī Bhagavat Sandarbha 
Śrī Rṣabhadeva accompanied the fire in burning the trees: While the fire burned the flora and fauna's gross bodies, He burned their subtle bodies. antith 
The pronoun tena is in the instrumental case along with the inde- clinable saha, in the sense of accompaniment. The sutra PĀŅINI 2.3.19, saha-yukte'pradhane, ordains that in such usage, the accompanying party is considered to be secondary. For example, in the sentence putreņa saha agataḥ pita, "The father came with his son," the father is the principal agent of the verb, and "son" is the secondary agent. In this particular case, the son is not assisting the father in coming, but merely accompanying him. So, saha means that the son is merely accompanying the agent of the verb. 
In the example from Bhagavatam, the fire was burning the trees, and Śrī Rṣabha was also engaged in that activity, thus assisting the primary agent in accomplishing the action. Or, it could also mean, not that he was assisting the fire, but accompanying it, by burn- ing the subtle bodies while the fire burned the gross ones. In this instance, saha does not mean that He was burnt along with the for- est, but rather that He accompanied the fire in the act of burning the forest. 
The Lord's burning of their subtle bodies means that He liberated them. If this prose selection from Bhāgavatam is understood to mean that Ṛṣabhadeva's body was burnt by the fire, it would contradict the previous text, which stated that His body is not material. Jon A further objection may be raised. In SB 5.6.6, it is stated that Rṣabha desired to give up His body, sva-kalevaram jihāsuḥ. Kalevara means body. Since the context is that Rṣabhadeva desired to give up His body, it seems appropriate to say that He was burnt in the forest fire. Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī states, however, that kalevara here means the material world; thus, the phrase means, "He desired to leave the material world." And even if the word kalevara were taken to mean the body, still, it does not indicate that He gave it up. Rather, in the case of the Lord, the words "giving up the body" simply mean leav- ing the world. This is confirmed in the following verse from Kūrma Purāṇa, cited by Śrīla Madhvācārya in his Bhāgavata-tätparya to the verse in question: 
528 
52 Śrī Ṛṣabhadeva's Body Is Transcendental 
When the phrase "giving up the body" (kalevara) is applied to Śrī Vişņu, it simply means that He disappears from the earth, and noth- ing more. But in the case of others, it means dying or giving up the body made of five elements.14 
Therefore, it is proper to say that Rṣabhadeva disappeared from the material world. Just as fire burned the trees and then disap- peared, the Lord burned the subtle bodies of the inhabitants of the forest and then disappeared. Fire exists in wood everywhere, but appears by friction; similarly, the Lord is present everywhere but appears by devotion. Hence, the comparison of the Lord with fire is appropriate. 
This explanation is also in agreement with an earlier state- ment by Śrī Śuka, "The Lord appeared in a form of unalloyed being [viśuddha-sattva]" (śuklaya tanvävatatāra, SB 5.3.20). Suka- deva Gosvāmi does not say that Śrī Rṣabhadeva took birth (janma). Rather, He appeared, and so He disappeared in the same way. The word antardadhe, "He disappeared," was also used in this way when Śrī Rṣabha's father, Nabhi, performed a sacrifice to attain a son. The Lord appeared in the sacrificial arena (āviścakāra, SB 5.3.2) and then disappeared after blessing King Nabhi (antardadhe bhagavan, SB 5.3.19).

IF RSABHADEVA'S BODY has the aforementioned characteristics, what more can be said about the body of the original and complete Personal Absolute? For example, Bhismadeva said the following: 
( 
मुनिगणनृपवर्यसङ्गलेऽन्तःसदसि युधिष्ठिरराजसूय एषाम् । 
अर्हणमुपपेद ईक्षणीयो मम दृशि गोचर एष आविरात्मा ॥ २४७ ॥ 
At Mahārāja Yudhisthira's Rajasuya sacrifice, there was a great assembly of eminent sages and mighty kings who honored Him, the cynosure of all eyes, by offering Him first worship. Now this Besame Self has again appeared before my eyes. (SB 1.9.41)1 
टीका च - एष जगतामात्मा मम दृशि गोचरो दृष्टिपथः सन्नाविः प्रकटो वर्तते । अहो मे भाग्यमिति भावः । इत्येषा ॥ श्रीभीष्मः श्रीभगवन्तम् ॥ 
Śrīdhara Svāmi comments: "[Bhismadeva said,] "This person, who is the Self of the cosmos, has appeared before my eyes, i.e., He has manifested before me and become visible. How fortunate I am!' This is Bhisma's intent."

53053 Kṛṣṇa's Body Is Transcendental and Most Beautiful 
Commentary in quods notando aid vedion oT 
IN THIS SECTION, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi will now establish that Śrī Kṛṣṇa's body is transcendental by using the a fortiori argument? Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the original and complete Reality, and He has three types of expansions, described by Śrīla Rupa Gosvāmi in the following verse: 
19226 911 
In the transcendental abodes lying beyond material nature, Śrīsup Kṛṣṇa exists in three kinds of expansions, called svayam-rupa, sib tad-ekātma-rupa, and aveśa. (LBH 1.11)3 
laur 
Kṛṣṇa's prakāśa manifestations in Vṛndāvana and Dvārakā are in the category of svayam-rupa. His tad-ekātma-rupa expansions include his vilāsa forms, such as Śrī Nārāyaṇa, and svāṁśa mani- festations, such as Śrī Matsya. There is no difference between Śrī Kṛṣṇa and His prakasa manifestations. His vilāsa manifestations are almost equal to Him in opulence, but His svāṁśa expansions have less manifest power than His vilāsa forms. 
Kṛṣṇa's āvesa-rupas, on the other hand, are not vişnu-tattvas; they are empowered jivas. They are not in the same category as Svayam Bhagavan or tad-ekātma-rupa. 
If an aveśāvatāra's body is completely transcendental, as dis- cussed in the previous anuccheda regarding Śrī Rṣabhadeva, and if a jīva like Nārada Muni, who is a śakty-aveśāvatāra, also has a transcendental body, then it goes without saying that the body of the original and complete Personal Absolute, Bhagavan Śrī Kṛṣṇa, should also be transcendental.

Narada describes his own spiritual body to Śrīla Vyasa in the First Canto: "As I was about to inhabit the pure body befitting an associate of the Lord, my body made of five material elements dropped away, as all the accumulated results of my karma had been extinguished" (SB 1.6.29)

To corroborate his conclusion about Śrī Kṛṣṇa's body, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī next cites a verse Bhiṣmadeva spoke while awaiting his death on the bed of arrows. In this verse, Bhisma recollects the Rājasuya sacrifice of Yudhisthira Mahārāja, which was attended by sages, scholars, great thinkers, brahmanas and kings from all over the world. On such occasions, it is the Vedic custom to honor guests, and so it was imperative to ascertain who in the assembly was most qualified to receive the first worship (agra-pūjā). This was a great distinction to bestow on someone, and care had to be exercised to make sure it was offered to the most qualified person; otherwise, more deserving individuals would be justifiably insulted. The qual- ifications of a candidate had to be considered based on such factors as caste, birth, strength, knowledge and so on. 
Although there were many great personalities in Yudhisthira Mahārāja's assembly, everyone, with the exception of Sisupāla, unanimously chose Śrī Kṛṣṇa to receive the agra-pūjā. In this verse, muni-gana, "eminent sages," and nṛpa-varya, "mighty kings," indi- cates that men of wisdom and of brawn were in attendance. Kṛṣṇa surpassed all in both these respects. Moreover, everyone marveled at His beauty, and thus Bhisma refers to Him as ikṣaṇīya, the cyno- sure or most pleasing object for the eyes. Sisupāla alone protested and was condemned because of it. 
bas 
This verse specifically refers to Śrī Kṛṣṇa's body, because Bhiş- madeva said that this same form was present before him now in the plain of Kuruksetra. In Krama-sandarbha, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi says that Bhisma described the Lord's body as most attractive, most wor- shipable and a most rare sight. His beauty was not material, for otherwise the sages, who are without attachment and of discern- ing nature, would not have been attracted to Him. The word muni, or thinker, implies that they had already ascertained that the mate- rial body is not essentially beautiful. The import is that Śrī Kṛṣṇa's body is transcendental and not saupadhika, or composed of material adjuncts. Great sages, well versed in Vedic literature, would not have respected and worshiped Him just because He was a king. 
Another important point being made in this verse is that the Lord had "become manifest" (aviḥ). This indicates that He exists

53 Kṛṣṇa's Body Is Transcendental and Most Beautiful 
everywhere at all times but had appeared or manifested in order to give pleasure to His devotee, Bhisma. It is the characteristic of Kṛṣṇa's transcendental body that He can manifest it to someone at His will, while simultaneously keeping it concealed from others. The learned and experienced Bhisma would not have exulted at his fortune if it were not so.

Devaki's Prayer to Śrī Kṛṣṇa 
make 
T 
५४ । तथैव च “रूपं यत्तत्” (भा० १० । ३ । २४) इत्यादौ " स त्वं साक्षाद् विष्णुरध्यात्मदीपः” इति । 
SIMILARLY, Śrīmati Devaki also says in her prayers to Kṛṣṇa at His birth: "[The Vedas] speak of some form which is [...] You, Viṣṇu Himself, the flame of spiritual truth" (SB 10.3.24). 
यत्तत् किमपि रूपं वस्तु प्राहुर्वेदाः । किं तद्वस्तु ? तत्राह - अव्यक्तमित्यादि । एवम्भूतं किमपि कार्यकल्पं वस्तु यत् स एव साक्षादक्षिगोचरस्त्वं विष्णुरिति । 
[Śrīdhara Svāmi:] "The Vedas speak of some form, namely some entity. What is that entity? Devaki answers that it is 'unmani- fest' (avyakta), etc. Whatever it is, that entity, which appears as though an effect, and yet is directly perceived by me, is You, Visņu Himself." 
तथा च पाद्मे निर्माणखण्डे श्रीभगवन्तं प्रति श्रीवेदव्यासवाक्यम्- 
Śrīla Vedavyāsa makes a similar statement to the Lord in the Nirmāṇa-khanda' of Padma Purāṇa: 
1 
त्वामहं द्रष्टुमिच्छामि चक्षुर्भ्यां मधुसूदन । 
यत्तत्सत्यं परं ब्रह्म जगद्योनिं जगत्पतिम् ।

2 In the extant edition, this verse falls in the Pätäla-kända, Vṛndāvana-māhātmya 
(PP 5.73.13). 
534 
54 Devaki's Prayer to Śrī Kṛṣṇa 
O Lord Madhusudana! I wish to see You with my eyes. The Upanisads describe You as Truth, the Supreme Brahman, the source and master of the universe. O Lord, let that form become visible to my sight.3 
तत्र हेतुः - अध्यात्मदीपः । देहितत्कारणकार्यसङ्घप्रकाशकत्वेनावभासमान इत्यर्थः । एवम्भूतस्य न तव भयशङ्केति भावः । इत्येष प्रकरणानुरूपः श्रीस्वामिदर्शितभावार्थोऽपि श्रीविग्रहपर एव । अन्यत्र भयसम्भावनानुत्पत्तेः || श्रीदेवकी श्रीभगवन्तम् ॥ 
The reason why Devaki says that the Lord is unmanifest and yet appears directly before her is that He is the flame of spiritual truth (adhyatma-dipa), meaning that He exists as the illuminator of the embodied being, the entirety of all bodies and the senses. Śrīdhara Svāmī says, "The import of Devaki's statement is that because He is such, He has nothing to fear." This interpretation, based on the context, specifically relates to the Lord's form, for otherwise there could have been no question of fear arising.* 
Commentary 
AFTER HONORING THE OPINION OF BHIṢMADEVA, one of the twelve Mahajanas, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī cites one of the prayers Devaki recited immediately after Krsna was born as her son. Śrī Kṛṣṇa took birth in Kamsa's prison house, and His parents feared that as soon as Kamsa heard this, he would murder the child. When mother Devaki noticed, however, that the child displayed the symptoms found in the Sup- reme Lord, she abandoned her fear and offered Him these prayers. In this verse, she establishes that her son was none other than Visnu, who has a completely transcendental body:b 
3tvam aham draṣṭum icchami cakṣurbhyam madhusudana yat tat satyam param brahma jagad-yonim jagat-patim vadanti veda-sirasas cākṣuşaṁ natha me'stu tat 
* In other words, because Kṛṣṇā had appeared in a human form, Devaki considered the prospect of His undergoing trials and tribulations as a result of the enmity of Kamsa and his associates. Since she was overcome by maternal affection, it was a problem to which she needed to respond and dispel. Had Kṛṣṇa remained invisible (avyakta), etc., no such perception of potential danger to Him would have been possible.

Śri Bhagavat Sandarbha 
[The Vedas] say this form is the unmanifest, the original; it is Brah- man, self-luminous (jyoti), beyond the material qualities, and with- out transformation. It is pure existence, without attributes, and without action. Verily, it is You, Visnu Himself, the flame of spiritual truth. (SB 10.3.24)5 
FIFET 
Śrīdhara Svāmī gives a lucid explanation of this verse in his Bhāvārtha-dipika. Devaki says that the form of Visnu before her is the same reality described in the Vedas. How do the Vedas describe His form? As unmanifest (avyakta) and as the original cause (ādya). Logicians conclude that atoms are both unmanifest and the cause of the universe, so does this mean the Lord's form is atomic? Devaki says, no- it is immense (brahma). Then perhaps it is pradhana, which is also unmanifest and massive, and according to the follow- ers of sänkhya, the cause of the universe? Śrī Kṛṣṇa also refers to pradhana as brahma in Bhagavad Gita: 
The total material substance, called Brahman [i.e., pradhana], is My own womb, into which I sow the seed of living beings. O descen- dent of Bharata, it is from that womb that all living beings proceed. (GĪTĀ 14.3) 
залмаін 
Devaki responds by saying that Kṛṣṇa's form is jyoti, or self- luminous, which, according to Śrīdhara Svāmi, means conscious (cetana), and since pradhana is inert, she could not be referring to it. 
Then perhaps His form is identical to Isvara of the Vaiseṣikas, who consider the atma conscious merely due to contact with the knowledge present in the material gunas? Devaki responds to this by saying nirguna - the Lord's form is free from the material gunas. 
Then could His form be like the ātmā described by the Mimām- sakas, who consider it to undergo a transformation through jñāna? Devaki negates this possibility by saying nirvikära, the Lord's form undergoes no change.

54 Devaki's Prayer to Śrī Kṛṣṇa 
Then is His form the atma of the followers of Puskarākṣa, who consider it empowered by maya's power of projecting the world appearance (vikṣepa-sakti)? No, because His form is sattă-mătra, pure existence, and does not depend on anything else. Thus, Kṛṣṇa's form remains eternally the same. Jo an a 
Perhaps, then, it is samanya, meaning that the Lord's form has divisions of proximity and remoteness, as described by the Naiyayikas? To this, Devaki replies, nirvišesa, His form is without divisions. 
If the Lord's form is the cause of everything, then it must undergo some change while producing effects, but Mother Devaki says it is nirīha, inactive. The Lord is exactly like a magnet that moves a piece of iron but remains still. 
Finally she says, "You are sākṣāt, directly perceivable." It is not that the Lord is inferred by observing an effect, as one may infer fire upon seeing smoke in the distance. Moreover, the Lord is adhyatma- dipa (a spiritual flame). This means that everything is illumined by His radiance-yasya bhäsä sarvaṁ idam vibhāti (MUU 2.2.10). The import is that He is the controller of everyone's senses, mind and body. Thus, there was no reason to fear Kamsa. 
This verse explains that the Lord's form is completely tran- scendental and beyond the conceptions of philosophers, such as Naiyāyikas, Sankhyaites and Mīmāmsakas. The verse exclu- sively describes the body of the Lord and not the various "absolute realities" imagined by these different philosophical systems. 
Śrīdhara Svāmī adds that this verse specifically draws attention to the form of the Lord since it comes in the context of Kṛṣṇa's birth. There is no question of someone's taking birth without having a form. 
Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi quotes a verse from Padma Purana spoken by Śrīla Vyasa, who was undergoing severe penances to please the Lord. After a long time, Kṛṣṇa came within his mind and offered Vyasa a boon. Vyasa desired to see the form of the Lord with his own eyes, the form which he described as the satyam paraṁ brahma mentioned in the Upanisads. This is consistent with the verse by Devaki, who also says the Lord's form is described in the Vedas as avyakta, nirviseṣa, 
537 
Śrī Bhagavat Sandarbha 
satta-mātra and so on. These attributes of Brahman are commonly referred to in the Upanisads; however, they apply specifically to the forms experienced by mother Devaki and Śrīla Vyasa. Therefore, it is established without doubt that Śri Krsna's body is self-luminous and transcendental to the gunas of nature. It is the Absolute Reality and reconciles all the apparently contradictory statements of the Vedas. sdIn the following anuccheda, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi will show that the expansions of Śrī Kṛṣṇa have the same qualities as Him. In this regard, he refers to Śrī Brahma's experience from brahma-mohana- lilā. bnu teum 21

The Visņu forms were embodiments of the one absolute essence, constituted of unalloyed being, consciousness and infinite bliss alone. Their infinite glory was certainly untouched even by those HE blessed with the vision of the Upanisads. (SB 10.13.54) off)

Śrīdhara Svāmi comments: "Although they all have individual forms, their constitution is without distinction, as described in this verse.

to them (vijātiya-sambheda-rahita). Over and above this, they remain always in a single form (eka-rasa).

"An alternative explanation is that the Lord's forms are the per- sonification of Brahman, which is uniformly unlimited, blissful, immutable, eternal and conscious, and nothing else. He cannot be known, therefore, even by those who see through the eyes 
of the Upanisads alone, or in other words, through the eyes of self- knowing. The indeclinable (emphatic) hi means, it is certainly the case that He cannot be known by them. The statement, "Their infinite glory was untouched' (asprsta-bhūri-māhātmya), means that the glory of these forms could not be perceived [even by those on the path of knowledge]. All these forms were seen by Brahma, with the aforementioned qualities." Here ends Śrīdhara Svāmi's 
comment. 
अत्र मात्रपदं तद्वर्णादीनां स्वरूपान्तरङ्गधर्मत्वं बोधयति । न ह्यत्रापरस्मिन्नर्थे मूर्तिशब्दः केवलात्मपर इति स्वामिनः श्रीशुकदेवस्य वा मतं लक्षणायाः कष्टकल्पनामयत्वातस्पृष्टे- त्यत्र । अस्पृष्टेति भूरिमाहात्म्येति अपीति उपनिषद् दृगिति पदचतुष्टयस्यैव व्यस्तस्य समस्तस्य च स्वारस्यभङ्गप्रसङ्गातुक्तप्रकारानुरोधात् “तेऽचक्षताक्षविषयं स्वसमाधि- भाग्यम्” (भा० ३।१५।३८) इत्यद्युदाहरिष्यमाणानुसारात् “स्वसुख” ( भा० १२ । १२ । ६८) इत्यादि श्रीशुकहृदयविरोधाच् च । 
p 
In this verse, the term mātra (alone ), [in the phrase, the Visnu forms of being, consciousness and bliss – “alone”] indicates that their color and other attributes cannot be other than aspects of their essential nature. Neither Śrī Sukadeva nor Śrīdhara Svāmī could have intended the word murti (form) to mean "the formless self" or anything else here, since it would be an abstruse exer- cise of imagination to ignore the direct meaning, which suits the present context, and resort to an indirect one instead. Further- more, such an interpretation would run contrary to the context, as it would spoil the flavor or tone (rasa) imparted to the descrip- tion by the four terms aspṛṣṭa (untouched), bhuri-māhātmya 
54055 The Partial Expansions of Śrī Kṛṣṇa Are Also Transcendental 
(infinite glory), api (even) and upaniṣad-drs (through the eyes of the Upanisads), whether they are read together as a compound word or separately. Moreover, the direct meaning of murti, as form, is in accordance with the experience of the Kumāras, as shall be demonstrated later, "As a result of their trance, they saw Him with their eyes" (SB 3.15.38). In addition, interpreting mürti here as the formless self would contradict the experience of Śrī Śuka, as described in verses such as SB 12.12.68.3

Therefore, other statements, such as, "[He is the] embodiment of pure consciousness" (viśuddha-vijñāna-ghanam, SB 10.37.23),* "unto Him, who is pure knowledge personified" (viśuddha-jñāna- murtaye, SB 10.27.11), and, "in You, whose body is full of bliss and knowledge eternally" (tvayy eva nitya-sukha-bodha-tanau, SB 10.14.22), should not be distorted by applying a secondary meaning, such as Brahman.

Similarly, no other meaning can be taken when it is said that the women of Mathura had a vision of Kṛṣṇa's form of bliss (ānanda-murti) and that Kubjā embraced it: "With their eyes, [the women of Mathura] took in and held [Kṛṣṇa's] form full of bliss" (SB 10.41.28).

Commentary 
AFTER EXPLAINING that Śrī Kṛṣṇa's form is eternal and transcenden- tal, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī next establishes that all the plenary portions of Śrī Kṛṣṇa are of the same nature. The verse cited here describes Śrī Brahma's experience upon seeing the various expansions of Śrī Kṛṣṇa after he stole the cowherd boys along with their calves. Śrī Kṛṣṇa expanded Himself and took not only the exact forms of the stolen calves and cowherd boys, but their personalities as well. When Brahma returned a year later to witness Kṛṣṇa's plight, he was astounded to see that His pastimes were going on as if nothing had happened. While he was thus marveling at Kṛṣṇa's yogic power,

he saw all the cowherd boys and calves turn into four-handed Vişnu forms. Śrī Śuka explains the nature, beauty and glory of these forms for a few verses (SB 10.13.46-55). This verse is the last in that series. 
In the event someone might think that these forms were magical creations, meant only to befuddle Brahma's intelligence, the verse says satya, they were real. Furthermore, the forms were full of con- sciousness and bliss. The matrat suffix, which appears in ananda- matra (bliss only), signifies that the murtis of Viṣṇu were not tinged by matter; they were fully conscious and unlimited. The word eka- rasa (remaining eternally the same One form) means that they were beyond the influence of time. Brahmā saw unlimited Visņu forms and each form was also unlimited. They were not liberated beings, because Brahma saw the mark of Śrīvatsa, one of the distinctive fea- tures of Śrī Viṣņu, on their chests (SB 10.13.48). Though there were unlimited forms, they were all one with Kṛṣṇa, the advaya-tattva who is free from duality. These forms were not different from each other in the way that one table is different from another. полипозни з is 
Kṛṣṇa gave a practical demonstration of the acintya-bheda- abheda reality-view (darśana) in this brahma-mohana-lila. The Lord is one, yet by His acintya-sakti, or inconceivable power, He manifests as many. Thus, the verse states that the glory of these forms was beyond the reach even of the knowers of the self who see through the eyes of the Upanisads. doua 0920 (by-inngin 
The Upanisads describe the Absolute as, "Truth, awareness, the infinite Brahman" (satyam jñānam anantam brahma, TU 1.2), "The knower of the joy of Brahman" (anandam brahmano vidvän, TU 2.4), and so on. From statements such as these, scholars of non-theistic persuasion assume that the Absolute has no form. slams adi 
mo This verse says, however, that the Lord's forms (murtayaḥ) are satya, jñāna, ananta, ananda-mātra - "unalloyed being, conscious- ness, infinity and bliss alone." This is beyond the conception of such scholars, because Kṛṣṇa can be understood only through the con- scious potency of bliss inherent in His own essential being, and that potency is what is meant by unalloyed devotion. As the Śruti declares: 
543 
Tramtalenesto Sri Bhagavat Sandarbhan 
of 
The Supreme Lord cannot be attained by mere study of the Vedas, nor through the intellect, nor by hearing. Only one who is blessed of by the Lord can attain Him, and only to such a person does the Lord reveal His form. (KU 1.2.23) 
The word mürti in the verse under discussion should not be mis- construed to mean ātmā or Brahman, because Śrī Brahmā saw these forms with his own eyes. Brahman has no attributes and thus cannot be seen. According to Amara-kosa 3.3.66, murti means either "body" or "solidity" (mürtiḥ käṭhinya-kayayoḥ). The Advaitavādīs propose that these forms were bodies of Brahman, or "solidified Brahman" appearing in Visņu forms. Such a meaning does not suit the context and is also contrary to logic. Brahman has no manifest qualities and thus can neither accept form nor become solidified. 
According to Advaita philosophers, Brahman cannot be named, since the act of naming introduces a plurality: the name, its mean- ing and the object referred to amount to three distinct entities. San- skrit logicians state that it is improper to imagine some uncommon secondary meaning when the commonly held primary meaning fits the context (sati prasidde'rthe'prasiddhartha-kalpanam anyāyam). Accordingly, Śrila Jiva Gosvāmī says that to conceive a secondary meaning, like that of ātmā or Brahman, in this particular instance would be "an abstruse exercise of imagination" (lakṣaṇāyāḥ kaṣṭa- kalpana-mayatvāt). Moreover, such an explanation is supported neither by Śrīdhara Svāmi nor Sukadeva Gosvāmī - and it certainly does not correspond to Brahma's experience. 
Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi refers to the experience of the Kumāras, the details of which will be discussed later in Section 90. He also cites the example of Sukadeva Gosvāmi, who was a living liberated being, and became a devotee simply by hearing some select verses from Srimad Bhagavatam, describing Lord's Kṛṣṇa's activities, beauty and qualities. If Kṛṣṇa's body were material, or inferior to Brahman, Sukadeva Gosvāmi would not have been attracted to His devotional service. The general psychology is that a person does not give up

544 
55 The Partial Expansions of Śrī Kṛṣṇa Are Also Transcendental 
a superior thing for an inferior one, whereas a discerning person will gladly abandon his inferior attachments to attain something superior, as here. 
Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmi offers various references from Srimad Bhāga- vatam that describe Śrī Kṛṣṇa's form as purely transcendental. And Brahmā realized this for himself when he saw the Lord's expansions: 
9 Thus, for a moment, the unborn Brahma beheld all these aspects of the Supreme Brahman, the Self of all, by whose effulgence this entire universe of moving and non-moving creatures is revealed. (SB 10.13.55)10 
In other words, Brahma saw that all the calves and boys were simultaneously nondifferent from the Supreme Lord. 
In the next anuccheda, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi will explain that Śrī Kṛṣṇa's body is the ultimate of all that can be aspired for, because it is the Absolute Reality.

Your beautiful face is effulgently framed with earrings made of guñjā berries. You wear a gar- land of forest flowers and You look so sweet, holding yogurt and fruits in one hand, a flute, horn and prodding stick in the other" (SB 10.14.1)?

By use of the verb avehi (to know), Sukadeva advises Parīkṣit to experience the form of the Lord exclusively through the know- ing that arises out of his [Sukadeva's] mercy, and not the know- ing that is arrived at through logical or rational deliberation. Although Kṛṣṇa is such (i.e., as described by Śrī Brahmā), still, by His māyā, i.e., His mercy, He appears or acts like an embodied person, just to attract everyone's heart towards Him for their benefit. The word iva ("like" or "as if"), implying similarity only and not identity, means that Śrī Kṛṣṇa has not entered into a separate body like an ordinary living entity.

ŚRĪ KRṢNA'S FORM is supremely transcendental and the topmost repository of love. Everyone in this material world, knowingly or unknowingly, is searching for love. Because Kṛṣṇa is the supreme repository of love, He is the ultimate end of all that is to be attained. This was wonderfully demonstrated in brahma-mohana-lila. When Brahma stole the calves and cowherd boys, Śrī Kṛṣṇa expanded Himself to perfectly replace each and every one of them: 
sd 
The unborn Lord took the forms of every one of the boys and calves, even the smallest of them, with the exact same hands, feet and others physical features, carrying the exact same sticks, horns, flutes and lunch bags, the same clothes and ornaments, the same personalities, qualities, appearance and age, and with the same activities and ges- tures, as if to show the truth of the statement that everything in the universe is nothing but Śrī Vişņu.

The love that the older gopis and the cows felt toward the expan- sions of Kṛṣṇa, posing as their offspring, kept increasing in intensity. At that time the gopis loved their sons in exactly the same way they loved Kṛṣṇa, even though they were unaware that it was Śrī Kṛṣṇa who was present before them in those forms:

without limit, as it did for Kṛṣṇa. Such a thing had never happened before. (SB 10.13.26)5 
Even Lord Balarama was astonished at this, though He was not aware of the actual situation, since He had been absent on the day Brahma stole the calves and cowherd boys. Upon hearing this, King Parikṣit posed the question: 
O saintly teacher, please explain how they [the cowherd women] докай 
could have had so much love for Kṛṣṇa, who was someone else's child. They never felt such love even for their own children. (SB 10.14.49) 
Sukadeva Gosvāmi responded to the question with seven verses, SB 10.14.50-56. He began by explaining that everyone loves them- selves above everything else, and loves other beings or objects only because they are somehow pleasing to the self. 
People who are identified with the body-self, love their own body because they mistake it for the self. They do not love anything else to the degree they love their own bodies. This is confirmed by Yajnavalkaya while instructing Maitreyi: 
ain 
It is not for the sake of the husband, my dear, that the husband is d loved, but for the sake of the self that he is loved. (BAU 4.5.6)' 
Неё втащо 
aquest to solaz dsl vino bavol at 1ise adi neva by Those whose self-concept is tied to the body, love the body, not for the body, but because it is what they believe the self to be. Thus, in spite of their attachment to the body, their real affection is for the self, whatever they take that to be at any particular phase of develop- ment. Thus, when the body grows old and decays, they still continue to desire life. It is thus the true self that is most dear to every living being. Everyone views the entire world as existing for the sake of the self. Thus, in the Udyoga-parva of Mahabharata, Vidura advised

10 One may give up a family member to save the family, and abandon a family for the sake of the village. One can renounce a village for the sake of the nation, but one must be prepared to sacrifice the entire earth for the sake of the self (ātmā). (MB 5.37.17)8 
入 
Having established that the self is that which is most dear to one and all, Sukadeva Gosvāmi then speaks the verse under discussion in this section (SB 10.14.55). He says that Śrī Kṛṣṇa is "the Self of all selves." In other words, Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the source of the self, which is itself most dear. Thus, He is the dearest of the dear and the ultimate repository, from which and toward which, love flows. 
The living entity is part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa, as He declares in Bhagavad Gitä: 
The living beings in this conditioned world, who are verily My eter- gnal integrated parts, are entangled with the mind and five cognitive senses, which are rooted in phenomenality (prakṛti). (GĪTĀ 15.7)" 
Kṛṣṇa is like the sun, and the atomic living entity is compared to the sun's ray. While people in general love other beings or objects only in relation to the self, the liberated devotees go a step further. Even the self is loved only for the sake of the Supreme Self, which is to say that they love Kṛṣṇa more than the self. Śrī Viṣṇu instructed Śrī Brahma in this regard at the beginning of creation: od sift 
ybod stit of themribsite 
O creator of the world! I am the Self of every self and the dearest sin of all that is beloved. Therefore, love is meant for Me, on account of 
whom the body and everything else are dear. (SB 3.9.42)10 
The residents of Vraja were naturally filled with inherent love for Kṛṣṇa. They loved Him more than their own selves, typifying the

teaching from the above verse. Thus, when Śrī Kṛṣṇa came to them in the form of their own sons, they naturally loved them just as they loved Kṛṣṇa. Their love for Kṛṣṇa was superior to the love they felt for their own offspring. Indeed, this was the case even with the cows. Neither the gopis nor the cows knew that it was in fact Kṛṣṇa who had come as their child, and yet their love still increased. This is because their love for Kṛṣṇa is causeless and unobstructed - the epitome of uttama-bhakti. Visiem uzimy loans basada en Saw

The demonstrative pronoun enam (this) in SB 10.14.55 refers to Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the son of Nanda Mahāraja, as he had been seen and described by Brahma at the beginning of his prayers. Kṛṣṇa manifests His supreme beauty and sweetness in Vraja. up all to vnam 20sang 
In describing Brahma's vision, Sukadeva Gosvāmi was simul- taneously blessing Parīkṣit Mahārāja that he too may realize the form of Kṛṣṇa as seen by Brahma. While in the womb of his mother, Parikṣit Mahārāja had seen the four-handed form of Kṛṣṇa. Now, by the mercy of his spiritual teacher, he was able to behold the most beautiful form of Kṛṣṇa. Indirectly, Sukadeva was blessing any serious student of Bhagavatam to be granted this vision of Kṛṣṇa. 
In commenting on this verse, Śrīla Viśvanatha Cakravarti Thakura says that one loves his or her child because of its relation

to the body (which one takes to be the self), and one loves the body because of the Indwelling Self, who is Kṛṣṇa present in the body. Kṛṣṇa is the complete whole, and He expands Himself as Param- ātmā, or Immanent God: "I exist, pervading this entire cosmos by a single portion of Myself" (viṣṭabhyaham idam kṛtsnam ekāṁśena sthito jagat, GĪTĀ 10.42). 
Bog blida ledtes mos 10 Therefore, Krsna is the highest limit of love. Viśvanatha further writes that the residents of Vraja are completely free from māyā and full of devotion; therefore, they are naturally endowed with this realization of Kṛṣṇa. By their very nature they love Kṛṣṇa more than their own offspring. According to Viśvanatha, this means they do not have to be aware of Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Lord, or even as Kṛṣṇa! Their love springs forth for Him, vehemently and unimpeded, whether knowingly or unknowingly. 
rot 
Although Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the Self of the self, He appears like an embodied being. His purpose is to attract the minds of the con- ditioned beings by performing alluring pastimes. One should not think, however, that He has a material body because He sometimes appears hungry and eats like an ordinary boy with His friends. The word iva ("like" or "as if") is important in this verse. It means that He appears as if an embodied being, but is not so in truth. Accord- ing to Vedic logicians, when an object is different from another but possesses many of its qualities, it is called similar!2 The similarity between the Lord and an ordinary boy is that He acts like one.of 
The word dehi (lit., "one who possesses a body") does not mean that Kṛṣṇa is distinct from His body, as is the case with ordinary embodied beings, or dehi. In His case the usage is figurative, in the vein of the ahi-kundala-nyaya, i.e., that of presuming a difference where one does not exist. According to this axiom, even though the coil (kundala) of a snake constitutes the snake (ahi) and is not sepa- rate from it, it can nonetheless be considered as an attribute of the snake. So too it is with Krsna and His body. Tava enplär

56 Kṛṣṇa's Form Is the Ultimate of All That Is to Be Attained 
Thus, Śrī Kṛṣṇa's body is nondifferent from Him and is the sup- reme of all that is to be attained, the parama-purusartha. Śrī Dhruva Mahārāja recognized this to be the truth when he called the Lord purusārtha-murti, or the personification of the ultimate attainment. Although Dhruva had approached God in the beginning with a mate- rial motive, namely to obtain a kingdom greater than that of his half- brother, after seeing the Lord face to face he realized that service to the Lord was superior to any other attainment. Thus, even when the Lord blessed him by offering him the whole world to rule, he was not pleased because he no longer regarded it as worthwhile. 
In the following anuccheda, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi will explain that the Brahman described in the Vedic literature is also the body of Bhagavan.

SO, THE BRAHMAN DESCRIBED IN THE VEDAS is nothing other than the divine body of the Lord. Maitreya states this in the following verse, which comes to an appropriate conclusion: 
तावत् प्रसन्नो भगवान् पुष्कराक्षः कृते युगे । 
दर्शयामास तं क्षत्तः शाब्दं ब्रह्म दधद् वपुः || २५४ ॥ 
O Vidura, being pleased, the lotus-eyed Lord showed Himself to him [Kardama Muni] in Satyayuga, the Brahman known through Vedic sound donning form. (SB 3.21.8)1

The word dadhat (donning) means manifesting that form, signi- fying that the Lord, named Sukla, exists in Satyayuga [Krtayuga]. In other words, He showed Kardama Muni that self-same form, which is Brahman, the Absolute Truth, revealed by Vedic sound.

AFTER ESTABLISHING that Śrī Kṛṣṇa's body is supremely tran- scendental and the topmost repository of love, Śrila Jiva Gosvāmi explains that the Brahman described in the Vedas is the body of Śri Krsna. To support his conclusion, he quotes Maitreya Rṣi's reply to Vidura's question regarding the lineage of Svayambhuva Manu, and specifically, about Kardama and Devahūti, the daughter of Manu. 
Maitreya Rși recounts that Brahma had ordered Kardama Muni to create progeny, and thus he performed penance for 10,000 years on the bank of the Sarasvati River. The Lord was pleased and showed Himself to Kardama, as described in the verse under discussion. The verse explains that the Supreme Lord has a form, which is the personification of Sabdabrahman. 
There are various types of pramāņas, or valid means of know- ing. These were outlined in the commentary to Section 9 of Tattva Sandarbha. Therein, it was explained that Bhagavan's form can be understood only through sabda-pramāņa, or revealed sound. Thus, His body is called Sabdabrahman. The Lord's body is self-luminous, which means that it reveals itself and, hence, cannot be perceived by material senses. Moreover, because sabda reveals the form of the Lord, sabda or Sabdabrahman is nondifferent from Him. This was confirmed by the Lord Himself to King Citraketu: "Śabdabrahman and Parabrahman are my two eternal bodies" (SB 6.16.51)? 
Also, Maitrāyaṇi Upanisad states: 
The Absolute Truth is to be understood as Sabdabrahman and Parabrahman. After comprehending Sabdabrahman, one attains Parabrahman, or the Supreme Lord. (Maitrayani Upanisad 6.22)3 
Because Bhagavan is understood through sabda-brahma, He is Śabdabrahman. In Anuccheda 47 it was explained that Bhagavan is nondifferent from His Name. Thus, it is possible to realize Him by 
2 sabda brahma param brahma mamobhe śāśvati tanū dve brahmani veditavye śabda-brahma paraṁ ca yat sabda-brahmani niṣṇāta paraṁ brahmadhigacchati

chanting His Names. In the very beginning of this Bhagavat San- darbha, it was shown that Brahman and Bhagavan are one. The same Absolute Reality appears differently to different types of worshipers. Therefore, the Brahman described in the Vedas is also the Lord, who is nondifferent from His body.bodh29b nem 
Śrī Śukla, mentioned in this anuccheda, is the yugavatāra for Satyayuga. He is described in SB 11.5.21. Kardama Muni said as much to Svayambhuva Manu, "These things were told me by Śri Sukla" (śukla-prokta, SB 3.22.19).

NOW THAT IT HAS BEEN SHOWN that Bhagavan's form is distinct from other objects, one should not improperly infer that His body is material because it is visible like a pot. This syllogistic statement is subject to the defect of stultified reasoning (kalatyay- opadiṣṭa). In order to demonstrate that the Lord's body is real and free from the six types of transformation, Śrī Brahma accepts His form as complete in itself:

नित्योऽक्षरोऽजस्रसुखो निरञ्जनः पूर्णोऽद्वयो मुक्त उपाधितोऽमृतः ॥ २५५ ॥ 
the You are the one Self, the primeval Supreme Person, the Absolute Truth - self-effulgent, endless and beginningless. You are eter- nal and imperishable, full of unobstructed joy, pure, perfect and complete. Being nondual and free from all limiting adjuncts, You are immortal. (SB 10.14.23)1

You are "the one Supreme Self" (ekātmā), the only ultimate shel- ter of everyone, distinguished by a cloud-complexioned form which was acknowledged as worshipable in the first verse of the Brahma-stava? This was further substantiated in verses like, "You were One in the beginning [...],"3 and, "You should know this Krsna to be the Self of all selves."4

Because You are the atma, You are truth (satya). The import is that you are the ultimate limit of reality or truth, since all other objects are true only by taking support of the truth that is You, the supreme shelter. This was stated by the devas when they prayed, "We take shelter of You, whose essence is Truth: You, who are true to Your vow, who value truth above all, who are truth in past, present and future; You, who are the womb of truth, who are con- cealed in all truth, and who are the Truth of truth. You are the eye of truth in the cosmic law" (SB 10.2.26). The Udyama-parva of Mahābhārata also states:

Declaring that the six transformations of the body, beginning with birth, do not exist in the Lord, Brahma says, "You are the original (adya), i.e., the Source." This was clearly demonstrated earlier in the verse, "You were One in the beginning [...]." There- fore, there is no birth for Bhagavan; rather, He becomes manifest, as stated in Padma Purana, "Birth in relation to the Lord means that He becomes visible. There is never any change in His body.'

The Śruti also con- firms this, 'In the beginning there was only the Self (ātmā) in the form of a person."

The reason for Bhagavan's completeness is that He is "unlimited" (ananta). The word advaya (nondual), means that His form is not limited by time and space. His form cannot be limited by any object because everything is His potency and cannot exist without Him. 
12 In general, the Vedic language was somewhat more fluid than classical Sanskrit, which has Panini's sutras establishing grammatical standards. Masculine and neuter nouns sometimes change their gender even in the classical language, but for the words sukha and ananda, this is very infrequent. Here, it seems that since they are predicates of words of the contrary gender, their gender has also changed.

In this verse, it is denied that the four results of action (kriya- phala) 13 can in any way be attributed to Krsna's body, in order to establish His immortality. The result called "creation" (utpatti) is denied owing to His being the original cause, adya. The remain- ing three results are negated respectively by the three phrases, svayañjyoti (self-effulgent), nirañjana (pure) and upadhito muk- tah (devoid of any limiting adjuncts). Out of these three, the result called "attainment" (präpti), can be accomplished either by physical action or through cognition. Attainment by action is negated by use of the word ātmā, because He is the indwelling Self of all beings, while attainment by cognition is denied by the phrase, "He is self-luminous" (svayañjyoti).ants SUTT WEA Jon bis Is

Answer: True, He includes Himself in the list. But the concluding statement, that all is a modification of mind, is general, and not universal, in its application. It is made due to the overwhelming prevalence of mutable phenomena in the list itself, and hence, it is a statement about such phenomena and not about Him. There- fore, this is an instance of overarching description, summed up in the maxim, "There go the men with umbrellas" (chatrino gacchanti).16 Later in the same chapter it is said:

58 Kṛṣṇa's Body Is the Complete Form of Bhagavan 
इत्यत्र परशब्देन ब्रह्मापि तन्मध्ये गणितमस्ति । तदेवं प्राप्तिर्निषिद्धा । 
In this verse, the word para indicates that even Brahman is enu- merated in a list of phenomena [and yet is obviously not phenom- enal]. So, in spite of Kṛṣṇa's mention in a list of phenomena, all of which can be attained through action or cognition, His form is not attainable or cognizable in this way, because of His self- luminosity. In this manner, the verse denies that the result of action (kriya-phala) known as attainment (präpti) can in any way be attributed to His form. 
vizellade अथ विकृतिरपि तुषापाकरणेनावघातेन व्रीहीणामिवोपाध्यपाकरेणेन भवेत् । तच् चासङ्ग- त्वान् न सम्भवेदित्याह - मुक्त उपाधितः इति । तदुक्तम् “विशुद्धज्ञानमूर्तये" ( भा० १०।२७।११) “विशुद्धविज्ञानघनम्” (भा० १० । ३७।२३) इत्यादौ च । 
Just as by beating paddy the husk is removed, similarly by remov- ing the limiting adjuncts, the kriya-phala of transformation occurs. Because the Lord is free from any material association, there is no possibility whatsoever of His being subject to limiting adjuncts, and thus His body cannot be an instance of the result called transformation. Thus, the verse states, "free from limit- ing adjuncts" (mukta upadhitaḥ). This is also expressed in verses such as, "Unto Him whose form is pure consciousness," and, "His form, which is pure consciousness."19

Commentary 
shame 
prost 
IN THE PREVIOUS SECTIONS, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī showed that Śrī Kṛṣṇa's body is transcendental. He also cited many verses verifying that the Lord became visible to certain individuals, such as Kardama Muni. Hearing this, a disputant may propose the following faulty inferential statements: 
In 20.00% 
1. Proposition: Kṛṣṇa's body is material. 
2. Reason: Because it is visible. 
3. Universal proposition: All visible objects are material, like a table. 4. Application: Krsna's body was seen by Brahma, Kardama, and 
others. 
45. Conclusion: Hence, Kṛṣṇa's body is material. 
Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi says this inference is fraught with the defect of kalatyayopadiṣṭa-hetu-ābhāsa, or stultified reasoning. Conclusions reached by stultified reasoning are negated by superior proof. 
For example, one may claim, "Fire is not hot because it is a sub- stance. Whatever is a substance, like water, is not hot." Such rea- soning is called hetu-abhasa, or logical fallacy, and is of the kalatyay- opadiṣṭa type. This conclusion is negated by direct perception of fire, which reveals that it is hot. Direct perception is superior to inference and thus overrules conclusions reached by such inferior processes. The neo-logicians call this badhita-hetu-ābhāsa.lt la sessant 
The conclusion expressed in the above hypothetical syllogism is superseded by Śruti, or revealed scriptures, such as, "Bhagavan's 
565 
yon to Sri Bhagavat Sandarbha da 
body is pure consciousness" (viśuddha-vijñāna-ghana, SB 10.37.23). In Tattva Sandarbha, Anucchedas 9-10, it was shown that in transcen- dental matters, sabda-pramāņa is the supreme means of valid know- ing. 
Next, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī shows that the Lord's body is free from the six transformations that all material bodies undergo. These are listed in the Nirukta Vedic dictionary: "The body takes birth, subsists, grows, undergoes changes by aging, or gives rise to by-products, dwindles and finally dies."23 
To prove that the Lord is free from these transformations, Jīva Gosvāmī cites a verse from the prayers of Śrī Brahma (SB 10.14.23). The material body is a product of past karma. Furthermore, it is made up of limbs, which are composed of matter. This means it is an effect, not a cause. Being an effect, the body comes into existence at a partic- ular time as a result of a causal chain of events, and this is called birth. Brahma says, however, that Bhagavan's body is adya. It existed in the beginning, prior to cause and effect. In Brahma-samhita, he says that Kṛṣṇa or Govinda is sarva-kāraṇa-kāraṇa, the original Source of all other causes. Hence, His body is not an effect of any prior cause, as is the case for the material body. 
Because the Lord's body does not undergo birth, the transfor- mation called astită, subsistence, or in other words, sustained exis- tence after birth, is automatically denied. Thus, Brahma calls Him nitya, or eternal. Material objects exist within an external field, but the Lord's body is the support of everything and exists in its own context, in His own energy. The Śruti says, "Where does the Lord exist? In His own glory" (sa bhagavā kasmin sthitah? sve mahimni, CHU 7.24.1). All phenomena exist in time and space, but Bhagavan's body is beyond these. He maintains everything, but is not main- tained by anyone. Asti means to exist for a measurable duration of time, and to do so within spatial vectors; the Supreme Lord's body is the basis for both time and space. nail podal jadralesve,oldw 25 Bhagavan's body is purna, or complete, and thus it does not increase.

that is complete or perfect doesn't undergo growth. The Lord is perfect because He is ananta, or unlimited, so how can He be said to grow? There is nothing that exists outside of Him that He could acquire. He is the limit of all limits, but He Himself is limitless.Idis 9 Bhagavan's body is ajasra-sukha, or eternally blissful. Therefore, His body does not produce by-products (vipariņāma). Ordinary human beings feel incomplete and therefore hanker for a compan- ion with whom they can share their life. To further expand their happiness, the couple unites and procreates. But the Supreme Lord does not procreate in this fashion, so His body cannot be said to pro- duce by-products. Alternatively, vipariņāma means that His body does not undergo changes, such as aging, because He is satya, or absolute. An object that does not transform in the three phases of time, namely, past, present and future, is called satya. urbano 
Brahma also calls the Lord akṣara, or imperishable. That which does not diminish or decay is called akṣara (na kṣaratity aksarah), and thus His body does not undergo the fifth transformation called apakṣaya, or diminution. Kṛṣṇa confirms this in GITA 15.18, wherein He says that He is beyond both the perishable and the imperishable (kṣara and akṣara). 
@dbidw 
Finally, because Kṛṣṇa is amṛta, or immortal, He is free from destruction. Since He is not born and His body does not dwindle, He does not die. "Death fears Govinda" (govindan mṛtyur bibheti, GTU 1.6). Consequently, because Kṛṣṇa's body does not undergo any of the six transformations, it is concluded that His body is not material. 
Furthermore, Bhagavan's body is not limited by time and space. Time is the movement of His bodily limbs: 
2509 
O friend of the unmanifest (prakṛti)! The phenomenon of time, by which the cosmos becomes active, is Your own activity. It is divided into units, from a nanosecond (nimesa) to years, up to periods as long as the lifetime of Brahma, but You are its master and the abode of all auspiciousness. I take shelter of You.

Śrī Bhagavat Sandarbha 
Every material body exists within time and space and is limited by them, but Brahma calls the Lord advaya, the nondual Reality, who is thus not limited by time, space or any other contingency. It is pos- sible for two objects to exist in all places and at all times. For exam- ple, space and time exist together and are both unlimited. They are independent, and thus, they limit each other. But the Lord is not lim- ited by anything, because He is the shelter of everything and every- body. Nothing can exist without Him. This is the meaning of the word advaya.but be esti 
To establish that Bhagavan is immortal, Brahma says that His body is not any of the four types of results of action (kriya-phala). All work involves action and the result for which it is performed. According to Sanskrit grammarians, there are four types of results: utpadya, creation; vikarya, transformation; samskarya, improve- ment; and präpya, attainment. The grammarian Bhartṛhari has summarized this in his Vākya-padiya:25 
b to dair 
1. When something did not previously exist and is created, it is older called utpadya. An example of something created is a garland, 
Chip which a devotee may make for the Lord. 
m2. When an existent object is transformed into something else, it is albor called vikarya. This is of two types. One is when the nature of the existent object changes, as when fire burns wood into ash. The other is when a change is made in the shape of the original object, as in making bangles out of gold.

3. When the characteristics of existent objects are modified or improved, it is called samskärya. An example is adding fragrance See to water. Ad Bellmil 18 a560 Shav

4. And to reach a destination is called präpya, such as when a devotee goes to the temple. This result also includes comprehending an observable entity through cognition.

The word adya, or original cause, excludes the Lord's body from being classified as utpadya, or that which is created as a result of some action. Kṛṣṇa's body is the original Source of all cause and effect, and hence not an effect of anything. 
An object is attained (präpya) either by physical activity or by cognition. This means that one acquires an object either through external or internal senses. The use of ātmā in the verse indicates that the Lord cannot be attained through physical action, because He is all-pervading. "That which exists everywhere is called ātmā, or in other words, Paramātmā" (atati sarvam gacchati iti ātmā). In this verse the word ātmā refers to Krsna and not to the individual living being. According to the neo-logicians of India, there are five types of physical action: 
Upward projection, downward thrust, contraction, expansion and 24motion are the five actions. (Kärikävali 1.6)26 
A 
ev Other actions, such as flowing, dripping, and so on, are included in motion. 
smen e ai dardw 
The Lord's body cannot be attained by these types of action because it exists everywhere. This was established in Anuccheda 41. The word ātmā also signifies that His body is pratyak, or manifest exclusively by its own conscious intent, and hence, it is beyond all sense perception. Thus, His body cannot be immediately cognized through the faculties of perception and conception, because it is not a material object. For this reason, Brahma calls the Lord svayañjyoti, or self-luminous. We need light to see material objects, but no light is needed to see the sun. We need our senses and mind in order to cognize objects, but the sun appears of its own accord, indepen- dent of our will and sensory capacity. In the same way, we cannot force the Lord to appear before us by performing some activity. He is seen and understood only by His mercy (which is to say, by His will) and not by any other means. This is stated in Santi-parva of Mahabharata: 
utkṣepanam tato'pakṣepaṇam akuñcanaṁ tatha prasaranaṁ ca gamanaṁ karmány etani pañca ca

Śri Bhagavat Sandarbha 
O Bṛhaspati, He can be seen neither by you nor by us. Only one who bis blessed by Him becomes eligible to see Him. (MB 12.336.20) 27/ 
In this way präpya is negated.

The third type of result, vikarya, or transformation, is denied by the words mukta upadhitaḥ, or freedom from all foreign superimpo- sition. Only material objects undergo such alterations. Since Bhaga- van's body does not contact anything material, He is free from alter- ations resulting from effort or time. Indra calls Him one whose form is pure consciousness (viśuddha-vijñāna-mūrti): 
I bow down to Him, who voluntarily assumes forms (according to the will of His devotees), whose true form is pure consciousness, who is everything, the seed of all things and the Self of all living beings. (SB 10.27.11)28 
An objection may be raised here. Śrī Kṛṣṇa described His vibhutis (opulences) in chapter 16 of the Eleventh Canto. In the midst of this account, He said that among those called Bhagavan, He is Vasudeva, which is a name of Kṛṣṇa that means "the son of Vasudeva." This means that Kṛṣṇa counts Himself amongst His own vibhutis. In con- cluding this topic, He says that all these vibhutis are merely modifica- tions of mind (SB 11.16.41). Does this mean that Bhagavan is also just a mental modification, and not the Absolute Reality? bosIn response, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi says that such a statement is made because the vast majority of the vibhutis listed by Kṛṣṇa are, in fact, mutable phenomena. This is an instance of overarching descrip- tion, as in the maxim, chatrino gacchanti, "There go the men with umbrellas" (chatri-nyaya). In a crowded place where many men are seen walking with umbrellas, a few among them may not have umbrellas. Still, onlookers remark, "There go the men with umbrel- las," including in their statement even those devoid of umbrellas. ai Similarly, because most of the vibhutis mentioned in the list are phenomena, Kṛṣṇa sums up His description with the overarching

57058 Kṛṣṇa's Body Is the Complete Form of Bhagavan 
statement that, "They are all modifications of mind." The statement, however, is specifically applicable to all phenomena in the list, and not to the non-phenomenal. In the midst of Krsna's descrip- tion, we find the phrase, vasudevo bhagavatam (SB 11.16.29), "Among those entitled Bhagavan, I am Vasudeva." In relation to this phrase, Kṛṣṇa's concluding statement (SB 11.16.41), that all this is a modifica- tion of mind, has to be understood in a secondary sense, by use of jahal-lakṣaṇā, which entails bypassing the primary meaning when it doesn't accord with the speaker's intention. 
A further objection is raised, challenging the claim that the Lord's body is free from vikara, or transformation. When Bhisma fought with Arjuna on the battlefield of Kurukṣetra, his sharp arrows wounded Śrī Kṛṣṇa, who was driving Arjuna's chariot. Bhis- madeva remembered this while lying on his bed of arrows awaiting death. One may conclude from this that the Lord's body is material. Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī says that this description is of māyika-līlā, pas- times of an apparent nature only. This means that Bhagavan's māyā projects an apparent scene so as to be viewed in a particular way to particular onlookers, yet the appearance contradicts the inherent truth of His being. This is similar to seeing a hero shot in a film or a play; in reality nothing happens to the actor. 
ass didwaasm 
This is also the definitive opinion of Śrī Sukadeva, the prime speaker of Srimad Bhagavatam. He says that those who think that Kṛṣṇa can fall into illusion, or that His body is material, forget that He is the Unlimited Lord. Bhisma was overwhelmed by a demo- niac warrior spirit, and the Lord, being a Player of unlimited skill, took on the appearance of being wounded to reciprocate with him in appropriate manner. 
Śrī Kṛṣṇa's body appears wounded to demons who fight with Him as well. The Lord thus nurtures their envious and ignorant nature, because He says that He reveals Himself exactly in accor- dance with the essential attitude with which He is approached (GĪTĀ 4.11). Otherwise, how would it be possible to pierce His tran- scendental body? He says that even the infinitesimal individual ātmā cannot be pierced by weapons (nainam chindanti sastrāņi, GĪTĀ 2.23). To further support this, the author cites two verses from Skanda 
571 
pengalŚri Bhagavat Sandarbha 
Purāṇa that describe Bhagavan's body as abhedya, or impermeable. Someone may raise the question, "Since Bhisma is a great devotee, how could he desire to harm Krsna?" Śrīla Viśvanatha Cakravarti Thakura writes that Bhisma's heroic mood was very pleasing to the Lord. He says that the Lord was relishing the relation of yuddha-rasa (the heroic battle spirit) with His devotee. She than mypi 
Still, one may insist, "How can arrows be considered pleasant?" Cakravartipāda offers an analogy to explain. When a hero who is overpowered by kandarpa-rasa, or erotic desire, makes love to a bold heroine, she may hurt him by scratching or biting. But rather than causing him distress, this action increases the hero's pleasure, while also demonstrating the intensity of the heroine's love for him. This is accepted by the Vedic sexologists and rasa theorists. In a similar way, Bhisma wounded Kṛṣṇa with his arrows, but this was highly pleasing to the Lord who was enjoying the spirit of battle. This, of course, does not mean that Kṛṣṇa's body was actually wounded, like an ordinary mortal. Later, however, when Bhisma was lying on his deathbed, he had embraced the mood of reverential service (dāsya- rasa) and thus supplicated the Lord. 
The f fourth and final result of action is samskarya, or improve- ment, which can be effected either by embellishment or cleansing. Bhagavan is pūṛna, perfect and complete, so this negates the possi- bility of embellishment. People wear ornaments to enhance their beauty, but the Lord's body is itself the reservoir of all beauty. When He puts on ornaments, they become embellished by contact with Him. This was described by Śrī Uddhava to bhakta Vidura: 
red 
The Lord appeared in a form that was appropriate to this mortal world. Demonstrating the power of His internal potency, yoga- Tsmāyā, the Lord took a form that was perfectly suited for pastimes ho in the world of humans. Because of its extraordinary beauty, it bs astounded even Himself. It was the epitome of auspiciousness and 
an ornament to the ornaments that decorated it. (SB 3.2.12)29 
29 yan martya-lilaupayikam sva-yoga-maya-balam darśayata grhitam 
vismapanam svasya ca saubhagarddheḥ param padam bhuṣaṇa-bhūṣaṇangam 
572 
58 Kṛṣṇa's Body Is the Complete Form of Bhagavan 
Nothing is needed to embellish the Lord's body, for He is per- fectly complete in His form and beauty. He puts ornaments on His body simply for the pleasure of the ornaments, who are His devo- tees. Finally, because Śrī Brahma says that Bhagavan is nirañjana, or inherently immaculate, He cannot be improved through cleans- ing or purification. He thus indicates that the Lord's body is not an effect of any action. Rather, the Lord is the cause of all causes, the source of everything-janmady asya yataḥ. He also addresses Him as purāna, which means that although the Lord is the oldest person, He is ever youthful and has a human-like form. This indicates that His body does not mutate like that of a mortal being. 
In the following anuccheda, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi will conclude this topic, by stating unequivocally that Bhagavan's form is part of His essential nature.

IN THIS WAY, it was first shown that the Lord's opulence, and so on, are part of His essential nature. This is appropriate since these opulences are intrinsic characteristics of that essen- tial nature, just as the intrinsic characteristics of fire, such as brightness or luminosity, belong to fire and not to darkness. 
अथ श्रीविग्रहस्य पूर्णस्वरूपलक्षणत्वं साधितं तच् च युक्तं सर्वशक्तियुक्तपरमवस्त्वेक- रूपत्वात् तस्य तत्र यो निजान्तरङ्गनित्यधर्मः श्रीविग्रहतागमस्तत्तत् संस्थानलक्षणस्तद् विशिष्टं परमानन्दलक्षणं वस्त्वेव श्रीविग्रहः । स एव चान्तरङ्गधर्मान्तराणामैश्वर्यादीनामपि नित्याश्रयत्वात् स्वयं भगवान् । 
Thereafter, it was established that Bhagavan's body is entirely constituted of His essential nature. This is also appropriate, because that Form is identical to the Supreme Existent, who is inherently self-endowed with all potencies. Among the inher- ent potencies of this Supreme Existent, His very own intrinsic eternal nature is the characteristic feature of His Divine Form, endowed with various limbs. Indeed, the Lord's Divine Form is verily the Supreme Existent, who is self-endowed with such attributes and is of the nature of supreme bliss. This Form is identical to the original and complete Being, Svayam Bhagavan,

The relation of the Absolute's body to the Absolute itself is compa- rable to the relation a sweet (laddu) has to pure powdered sugar (khanda), that out of which it is formed. Laddu, a particular- ized form of sweet, is nothing other than pure powdered sugar, shaped in such a way that it features all the necessary compo- nents that make it recognizable as a laddu. Because the laddu is simply powdered sugar, it has the fragrance, taste and other characteristics that naturally exist in powdered sugar. This fact is commonly recognized and acted upon [by people who enjoy eating sweets]. Similarly, the Lord's Divine Form is the Supreme Absolute Truth, as stated in verses such as SB 3.9.2, "He is that Form." And that very Form is recognized, by those in knowl- edge, as Bhagavan, the Supreme Lord Himself, and is dealt with appropriately.

IN THIS SECTION, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi concludes his investigation of the nondifference of Bhagavan's body from Himself. This means that all the characteristics found in the Lord are found in His body as well. Light has an intrinsic nature, possessing characteristics such as brightness, whiteness or luminosity. This characteristic is part of light. It does not belong to anything external to, or outside of, light. Similarly, the characteristics of the Lord belong to Him.

illusory manifestations that can be taken away: They are part of His svarupa, and thus all the characteristics of the Lord are in His body. Indeed, Bhagavan, His body and His characteristics are all one and the same. un 27 msmo abrod sit nove jadi aidates of anlged 
To clarify this, Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī gives the example of a sweet- ball (ladḍuka) and pure powdered sugar (suddha-khanda). The laddu is formed out of sugar, and there is absolutely no difference between the laddu and its constituents. The very same taste, texture, smell and color found in the constituents are also present in the ball. Simi- larly, the Absolute Truth in His own intrinsic being (svarupa) is like pure powdered sugar, and His form (rupa) is like the sweetball. All the characteristics inherent in His intrinsic being also exist in His body. There is absolutely no difference between the two. Just as the constituting essence that is pure powdered sugar is nondifferent from its particularized form as a sweetball, so is the Lord identical to His body. 
Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi uses the word suddha-khanda, or pure pow- dered sugar. "Pure" indicates there is nothing foreign in it, and "powdered" implies uniformity. This nullifies the possibility that a particular portion of the ball could be sweeter, or in some other way different from any other part of the ball. Hence, all the limbs of the Lord are endowed with all the characteristics of the Absolute Real- ity; this is the verdict of experienced transcendentalists, such as Śrī Brahmä: 
I worship the primeval person, Lord Govinda, whose transcendental form is full of bliss, consciousness, eternality and self-luminescence. Each of the limbs of His body can perform the functions of all of the other senses. He thus eternally sees, maintains and mani- fests the infinite universes, both spiritual and mundane. (Brahma- samhitā 5.32)5 
Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī then refers back to the three verses that describe Śrī Brahma's personal experience of the Lord and His body. These verses (SB 3.9.2-4) were discussed in Section 51. They explicitly

state that there is absolutely no difference between Bhagavan and His body.blobodan enl 
bTo further substantiate his conclusions, Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī begins to establish that even the Lord's ornaments and dress are part of His svarupa. If this can be shown, it automatically confirms that the Lord's body is part of His essential nature. He cites two verses describing how, bedecked with ornaments and dress, the four-armed Śrī Visņu appeared to His parents in Kamsa's prison. Later, this four-armed form disappeared along with all His orna- ments, before He reappeared again as a normal child. Just as Bha- gavan appeared and disappeared, so did His ornaments and dress. This is because they all belong to His svarupa.

exclusively on His transcendental form. That the Lord appears to them "free from distinction" (vikalpa-rahita) means that He reveals to them His transcendental form, which is supremely blissful and of one unchanging uniform identity. The word yatha (just as) means "in the same way as;" in other words, just as the Lord [though replete with form and attributes] is experienced as being of one unchanging uniform identity by those established in exclusive worship of Him, [so too, this one uniform Absolute Entity employs potencies and form, and yet remains one and unchanging.]

He does so, out of His own māyā, sva-māyaya - which here means, out of mercy upon "His own [people]," or in other words, upon those who worship Him as their Lord, master and beloved. Mercy is the cause of His doing so. The word svaya means Svayam Bhagavan, the complete personal nondual Reality. He Himself in His own essential form, inherently self-endowed with won- derful potencies, "employs" (dhatte) or displays these potencies in the form of ornaments, weapons and so on. "On the truth of this statement," means on the evidence of realized devotees who have directly experienced the Lord as such. So, if this statement is true, then may the Lord protect us through all these won- derful manifestations of His essential Being, distinguished as ornaments, weapons and so on.

Commentary 
AFTER EXPLAINING that Bhagavan's body is part of His svarupa and thus nondifferent from Him, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī begins explaining that even His dress and weapons are part of His innate nature. Our own experience is that one's dress and ornaments do not belong to the body. A change in dress and ornaments does not effect a change in the person. Since no one is born wearing these items, it means they are extraneous; they are not part of the body. 
Such is not the case with the Lord. Although Kṛṣṇa's ornaments and dress are put on His body, they also belong to His innate nature, just like His body. There is no difference between Bhagavan and His body, nor is there any difference between Him and His dress or 
7 
ornaments. 
In the previous anuccheda, it was explained that when Śrī Kṛṣṇa appeared as Visnu before Vasudeva and Devaki in Kamsa's prison, He was bedecked with His celebrated ornaments and yellow dress. Sūta Gosvāmi therefore described Him as adbhuta-bālaka, an extraordinary baby. No baby takes birth with dress and ornaments already decorating the body. Similarly, it is described that when the Lord appeared as Vamana to Aditi and Kasyapa Muni, He did so with

The Lord assumed His unmanifest spiritual form, which became manifest with ornaments and weapons. Then, as His parents watched, He, like an actor, in that very form, became Vamana, the boy brahmana. (SB 8.18.12) 
The two verses at the beginning of this anuccheda are spoken by Viśvarupa and are part of the description of the Nārāyaṇa shield (kavaca). Viśvarupa was the son of Tvaşță and became the officiat- ing priest of the devas after Bṛhaspati left them, on account of being insulted by Indra. Viśvarupa prayed to the Lord, who was hold- ing weapons and wearing ornaments and insignia constituted of His own internal potency. He uses the term sva-māyā to indicate that the Lord holds these weapons and wears these ornaments simply out of His mercy. The word māyā here should be taken to mean mercy. 
Śrīpāda Vijayadhvaja Tīrtha gives the following quote from the smṛti-śästra to show that the weapons and ornaments of Bhagavan are of the nature of His svarupa-śakti: 
yd 
The supreme unborn Śrī Visņu exists in the form of His energies, gardistinguished as ornaments, cakra and flag?arob [simoza wo 211 
boyIn this verse, the word "ornaments" also indicates His dress and other weapons. It is for this reason that the Lord's weapons and ornaments are also worshipable by the devotees. Viśvarupa offers prayers to them:st havssedo zew all mill smiled adimplie

gone an Śri Bhagavat Sandarbha 
When Durvāsā Muni created a witch to attack the great devotee Ambarīṣa Mahārāja, Sudarśana Cakra came to his rescue. Durvāsā was forced to run all over the universe, seeking protection from the cakra, but no one could help him, not even Brahmā. Finally, he went to Śrī Viṣṇu, who advised him to beg Ambarīṣa's forgiveness. Ambarīṣa Mahārāja then requested the Lord's cakra to spare Durvāsā Muni. From these prayers it is evident that the cakra is as powerful as the Lord Himself. Ambarīṣa said: 
blstra 
O Sudarśana Cakra, you are Fire, the Sun, who is Lord of the cosmos; and the Moon, the master of all luminaries. You are Water, Earth and Sky; you are the air, the five sense objects, and the senses as blo

tadt wora of 
Ambarīṣa Mahārāja offers prayers to Sudarśana Cakra just as he would to the Supreme Lord, because Sudarśana Cakra is directly the potency of the Lord, nondifferent from Him. Any entity that is, by its own essential constitution, worthy of worship cannot be imag- inary or material. That the weapons of the Lord can appear sponta- neously and of their own volition, just as the Lord does, was observed when Sudarśana arrived to protect Ambarīṣa Mahārāja. When Śrī Kṛṣṇa prepared to disappear from the world, His weapons left for Vaikuntha before Him. This was observed by Daruka, His driver:

All the divine weapons of Viṣṇu rose up and followed the chariot. Lord Janardana then spoke to His chariot driver, who was most astonished to see this. (SB 11.30.45)13

60 Bhagavan's Weapons Belong to His Svarupa 
Thus, it is evidenced that the weapons of the Lord are conscious and transcendental, just like the Lord. Sometimes they appear with Him and sometimes independently, just like Bhagavan's other asso- ciates. In Section 10 it was mentioned that His associates are tran- scendental. The Lord's weapons and ornaments are also considered to be His associates; consequently, they too are transcendental and belong to His internal potency. 
Next Śrī Jiva Gosvāmi shows that Bhagavan's abode is also part of His svarupa, or intrinsic nature.

Vaikuntha Is Also Part of Bhagavan's Svarupa 
६१ । अथ श्रीवैकुण्ठलोकस्यापि तादृशत्वम् " तस्मै स्वलोकं भगवान् सभाजितः” (भा० २।९।९) इत्यत्र साधितमेव । पुनरपि दुर्धियां प्रतीत्यर्थं साध्यते । 
IT WAS PREVIOUSLY established that the Lord's abode is also part of His essential nature, in verses such as, "He showed [Brahma] His own planet, Vaikuntha" (SB 2.9.9). Nonetheless, for the sake of clarifying the topic for those who would otherwise miscon- strue the Absolute through aberrated intellectualism, we will demonstrate it here once again, as follows: 
यतः स कर्मादिभिर्न प्राप्यते । प्रपञ्चातीतत्वेन श्रूयते । तं लब्धवतामस्खलनगुणसात्म्येन स्तूयते । नैर्गुण्यावस्थायामेव लभ्यते । लौकिकभगवन्निकेतस्यापि तदावेशान् नैर्गुण्यम- तिदिश्यत इत्यतः स तु तद्रूपतया सुतरामेव गम्यते । साक्षादेव प्रकृतेः परत्वेन श्रूयते । नित्यतयोद्बोष्यते । मोक्षसुखमपि तिरस्कुर्वन्त्या भक्त्यैव लभ्यते । सच्चिदानन्दघनत्वेना- भिधीयत इति ।

1. Bhagavan's abode, being identical with the nondual Reality, cannot be attained by dualistic action, which is to say, by result-oriented action (karma) of any kind. 
2. It is described in the Vedas as transcendental to the manifested 
cosmos. 
3. It is glorified for the reason that those who attain it, being per- vaded by its intrinsic nature, do not fall down to the material world. 
4. It can be attained only by one permanently established in free- 
dom from the gunas of material nature. 
Discussed extensively in Anuccheda 10.

61 Vaikuntha Is Also Part of Bhagavan's Svarupa 
5. The abodes of the Lord within the material world are also said to be transcendental to the gunas because of His presence in them; this being the case, Vaikuntha is certainly ascertained to be transcendental by the a fortiori principle. 
6. Scriptures declare that the Lord's abode is, by its very nature, jobs beyond material nature. 
7. They declare it to be eternal. 
8. It is attained only by pure devotion, [or in other words, by nondual action that is causeless, uninterrupted, produces no ng extraneous effects and is one in nature and orientation with brow the nondual complete whole, Śrī Bhagavan]. Such nondual Palo devotion belittles even the bliss of liberation, which is merely 
the negation or absence of dualistic or result-oriented action. 19. It is referred to as sat-cit-ananda-ghana, a highly compact mass 
of eternal being, consciousness and bliss.

Svarloka is the residence of the celestial beings; Bhuvarloka is that of the spirit entities; Bhuloka is the world of mortals. The worlds attained by the Siddhas, or those who have attained M the mastery over the paranormal powers, exist beyond these three and divisions. Śri Brahma created the region below the Earth for the ungodly (asuras) and the serpent race (nāgas). In this man- ner, the various destinations available within the three worlds have been arranged in accordance with the scale of action con- ducted under the influence of the three gunas. Through yoga disci- pline, severe austerities and adherence to the renounced order of

life, the spotless destinations of Maharloka, Janoloka, Tapoloka and Satyaloka can be reached. One who embraces the yoga of unalloyed devotion, however, attains My abode. (SB 11.24.12-14)2

The Siddhas, or those perfected in paranormal ability, by pro- cesses such as yoga, attain planets like Mahar, which are beyond the three planetary systems. The region below the Earth refers to the group of planets beginning with Atala. Included in the three planetary systems are Bhu, Bhuvar, and Svar, with Pātāla and the other lower planets counted as part of Bhuloka. Actions conducted under the influence of the three gunas is a reference to the duties of a God-centered married life, embedded in a social network (gärhasthya-dharma). Tapas, or "austerity," refers to the duties associated with retirement from household life and the related social network (vānaprastha). It also refers to the duties of student life, involving education, character formation and grounding in truth (brahmacarya). Of these, those who fol- low the two types of brahmacarya, i.e., upakurvāṇa and naiṣṭhika, attain Maharloka and Janoloka, respectively. By following the vānaprastha duties, one reaches Tapoloka, and by sannyāsa, Satyaloka. But all these can be attained by different degrees of advancement in yoga.

Commentary gnisto vo Threys to Stellen 
AFTER CONFIRMING that the body, dress, weapons and ornaments of the Lord are part of His svarupa, Śrī Jiva Gosvāmī demonstrates that the same applies for Vaikuntha. Anuccheda 10 briefly touched on this point with reference to Brahma's vision of Śrī Kṛṣṇa and His abode, wherein it was shown that Vaikuntha is free from māyā, the material nature and her by-products. Because maya and the gunas are absent in Vaikuntha, time has no influence. Vaikuntha is a manifestation of suddha-sattva, or nondual being, free from the gunas of nature (PP, Uttara-khanda 6.91.57)? Anuccheda 10 also stated that this pure sattva, or nondual being, is not just material sattva emptied of any tinge of passion and ignorance, but is Bhagavan's own internal potency. 
While Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī incidentally discussed the transcenden- tal nature of Vaikuntha in Section 10, he will now focus his attention on this topic for the next twelve anucchedas. He begins by listing nine characteristics of Vaikuntha: 
5 isvarah sarva-bhūtānāṁ hrd-deśe'rjuna tişṭhati

1. It is not attainable by dualistic action, or in other words, by result- oriented action of any kind (karmädibhir apräpyatvam, discussed in this anuccheda). 
2. It is beyond the visible or manifested cosmos (prapañcātītatvam, 
in Anucchedas 62 and 64). 
3. Its residents are infallible (tato'skhalanam, in Anucchedas 63-64). 4. Only a person permanently established in freedom from the gunas of material nature can attain it (nairgunya-präpyatvam, in Anu- ccheda 65). 
5. It is the seat of unalloyed being, free from the gunas (nair- 
gunyaśrayatvam, in Anuccheda 66.1). 
6. It is transcendental to material nature (prakṛteḥ paratvam, in Anu- 
ccheda 66.2). Amigo 26 
7. It is eternal (nityatvam, in Anuccheda 67). 99 
ble

8. It is attainable only through bhakti, or unalloyed devotion, which 
belittles the bliss of liberation, since that bliss is no more than de the absence of dualistic action (mokṣa-sukha-tiraskari-bhakti-eka- Syllabhyatvam, in Anuccheda 68). 
9. It is by nature eternal, full of consciousness and bliss (sat-cit- 
ananda-rupatvam, in Anuccheda 58). 
Śrī Jiva Prabhu provides evidence for these nine characteristics in twelve anucchedas, beginning with this one, showing that Vaikun- tha is not a manifestation of the external energy but belongs to the Lord's svarupa. In this section, Jīva Gosvāmī first explains that Vai- kuntha cannot be attained by dualistic action, or in other words, by result-oriented action of any kind. This is to say that it cannot be attained by any method other than nondual devotion, which is not a method in the sense of generating any extraneous effect. It is imme- diate and direct centering of awareness in the nondual complete whole, facilitated through the agency of His own internal potency. 
All dualistic actions, performed with the body, mind or speech, directly or indirectly, tend toward producing particular effects. The karaṇa-guna-prakrama-nyaya explains that every effect of an action necessarily reflects the qualities inherent in its cause. Thus, the result of all material action will be material. After death, a person attains a destination befitting the karma accrued in the previous life or lives. This formula is briefly stated by Śrī Kṛṣṇa in Bhagavad Gitä: 
591 
fall 
Śrī Bhagavat Sandarbha 
Those situated in sattva-guna ascend to the higher planets; those in rajo-guna remain in the middle region; and those in tamo-guna, who engage in detrimental action, go downward. 
When the seer observes that there is no performer at work other than these gunas, and knows himself to be beyond them, then he attains to My nature. (GĪTĀ 14.18-19)8 
Kṛṣṇa describes this same principle in greater detail in the three verses from Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam (SB 11.24.12-14) quoted here by Śrī Jiva Gosvāmi. In this context the word siddha, lit., "perfected being," refers to those who have attained mastery in yoga and who have thus perfected the paranormal abilities, such as anima (atomization). It does not refer to the perfection of liberation or devotion. Analysis of these verses clearly shows that every planet, except for the nondual abode of the Lord, is attained as an effect of dualistic action, includ- ing even austerity and yoga. Karma, yoga, austerities and renuncia- tion are dualistic in the sense of being enacted from the perspective of being a separated or isolated self, and aiming at producing particu- lar effects extraneous to the self. Such endeavors are tainted by the gunas of material nature and lead to different destinations within the material world. 
wortel 
Vaikuntha, however, is attained by nondual devotion. Although nondual devotion makes use of the mind and physical senses, which is to say that it manifests through these agencies, it is not mental or physical action. This means that it is not dualistic action performed by an apparent isolated doer, through instruments (the mind and senses) that are distinct from the doer, and generating an effect that is again distinct from both the doer and its instruments. Non- dual devotion, rather, is directly the potency of the nondual Abso- lute. It is not an event generated or performed by an isolated doer, nor through material instruments. Being conscious by nature and beyond the gunas, it flows vehemently and of its own will, toward the ātmā that is first offered to the nondual whole, pervading the ātmā

61 Vaikuntha Is Also Part of Bhagavan's Svarupa 
as well as its instruments (the mind and senses). Thus, the ātmā, the physical instruments, the act of worship and the Entity toward whom such devotion is directed, all become of the same identical nature, that of conscious, blissful, nondual being. 
oftailcub 
It was shown in Anuccheda 46 that Bhagavan's name is not capable of being grasped by the tongue or material senses. Rather, when the ātmā is first offered in devotion, the name makes its appearance, by its own will, on the tongue and other senses. That nondual devotion or worship is not a material action is discussed at greater length in Bhakti Sandarbha, Anuccheda 234. lleva into slidesqua 
The word karma in these verses refers to those who follow the duties associated with a God-centered household life. This does not refer merely to conventional married life, rooted in satisfaction of ego drives. Rather, in the broad sense it is action in harmony with God's creation, and one that honors the entire interconnected network of relations that make life possible on earth.AVI 2 
In the Vedic context this refers to the actions of religious house- holders, who uphold the worship of various deities who maintain the cosmic order. Such householders perform the pañca-maha- yajñas according to Smrti injunctions.fanitab laisten la doldwni 
Tapas, which means austerity, refers to those who adhere to the rules of either vanaprastha or brahmacarya. In both of these āśra- mas, austerity is a prominent requirement. Brahmacarya does not, however, exclusively mean unmarried individuals or lifelong celi- bates. Brahma means the Veda, and one who studies the Vedas under a spiritual teacher while adhering to the foundational training that alone makes possible the reception of his wisdom, as described in the Purānas and Smrtis, is called a brahmacārī. There are two types of brahmacāris. Śrī Kurma describes them as follows: "A student who properly studies the Vedas, remaining fixed in the Absolute Real- ity until the end of his life, is called a naiṣṭhika-brahmacārī. A stu- dent who enters household life after completing his studies is called upakurvāṇa-brahmacāri" (Kurma Purāņa 1.2.77-78)? 
brahmacary upakurvano naiṣṭhiko brahma-tat-paraḥ yo'dhitya vidhivad vedän gṛhasthāsramam āvrajet upakurvāṇako jñeyo naiṣṭhiko maraṇāntikaḥ 
593 
sqvŚri Bhagavat Sandarbha iy 
Nyasa refers to the renounced order of life, sannyāsa. None of these people can attain Vaikuntha because their actions are under the gunas of nature, and Vaikuntha is not attained as an effect of dualistic action. 
eld The yan na vrajanti verse (SB 3.15.23), which will be discussed more fully in Section 68, explains that those whose consciousness is locked-in to topics unrelated to the pastimes of the Supreme Lord cannot reach Vaikuntha. In the verse from the same chapter quoted here (SB 3.15.20), Brahmā states that Vaikuntha abounds with air- ships, which have become available to the devotees simply by offer- ing obeisances to the Lord, indicating that Vaikuntha is beyond karma. Offering obeisances here is indicative of all other categories or methods of worship. The word matra, meaning "only" or "exclu- sively," indicates that such bhakti is not mixed or supported by any other process, such as jñāna or karma. 
Śrī Jiva Prabhu further cites Mundaka Upanisad in order to con- firm his point through Śruti. Here the word akṛta (prior and tran- scendental to dualistic action) is an adjective qualifying the Vaikun- tha world. This can be inferred from the preceding part of the verse in which all material destinations were called karma-jita, or attained as an effect of action. Since lokas are the topic under discussion, the word akṛta could not have another referent. 
30 
In some editions of this Upanisad, the word parikṣya (after inspecting) is used in place of paritya (after passing through). This would then mean that a learned brāhmaṇa, after scrutinizing the var- ious planets that can be obtained by karma, loses interest in them. He realizes that Vaikuntha is beyond karma. Then, to understand Vaikuntha, he approaches an authentic spiritual teacher, as is stated in the second half of the above-quoted lines: 
ismer 
In order to realize this truth, one should go, bearing fuel for the sac- rificial fire, to a spiritual teacher who is thoroughly acquainted with scriptural truth and firmly grounded in the truth of Ultimate Being. (MUU 1.2.12)10 
10 tad-vijñānärtham sa gurum evabhigacchet samit-pāniḥ śrotriyam brahma-nistham 
594 
61 Vaikuntha Is Also Part of Bhagavan's Svarupa 
The only means by which the Lord or His abode becomes avail- able is through His mercy and that of His devotees. Jada Bharata confirmed this while instructing King Rahugana: he divisions or 
O King Rahūgana, one does not attain the Absolute Truth through asceticism, rituals, renunciation, nor by following household life, the study of the Vedas, nor through the worship of water, fire or sun, but only by smearing one's body with the dust of the feet of pure devotees. (SB 5.12.12)11 
In Section 58 it was shown that the Lord's body cannot be cate- gorized as one of the fourfold results of action. The same analysis can also be applied to His abode. Eternal, self-effulgent entities can- not be achieved as an effect of any dualistic or result-oriented action. Therefore, Śrī Kṛṣṇa advises Arjuna (GĪTĀ 18.62) that one can attain the eternal abode, Vaikuntha only by submission of inherent being, consciousness and all forms of attention unto Him.

(2) VAIKUNTHA IS TRANSCENDENTAL to the manifested cosmos (prapañcãtitatva). Rudra declares this truth to the Pracetas: 
स्वधर्मनिष्ठः शतजन्मभिः पुमान् विरिञ्चतामेति ततः परं हि माम् । अव्याकृतं भागवतोऽथ वैष्णवं पदं यथाहं विबुधाः कलात्यये ॥ २७३ ॥ 
A person scrupulously devoted to his occupational duty for one hundred births becomes eligible to occupy the post of Brahmā, and if he becomes yet more qualified, he can attain me (Lord Śiva). A worshiper of the complete Whole, Bhagavan, however, is immediately promoted to the abode of the Complete (vaiṣṇavam ipadam), which is free of all divisions or modifications (avyākṛta), just as the other gods and I go there after the destruction of our subtle bodies. (SB 4.24.29)1

If one has a great deal more piety [than needed to attain the post of Brahma], he attains my world. But a worshiper of the Complete Whole, Bhagavan, after giving up his body, attains the abode of the Complete, Śrī Viṣṇu, which is known as Vaikuntha. It is

Just as I, Rudra, exist as an office-bearer, so do other devas. At the end of our appointed duration, and when our subtle bodies are destroyed, we go to that place, in accordance with the principle stated in Brahma-sutra, "The office-holders remain in this world until their tenure is completed" (vs 3.3.33). 
Commentary 
indend k 
ŚRILA JIVA GOSVĀMĪ NOW EXPLAINS that Vaikuntha is beyond the visible or manifested world (prapañca), beyond even Śrī Brahma's realm, Satyaloka, which is considered to be the topmost planet in the universe. From the verse quoted in this section, it is clear that Śrī Rudra's world is superior even to that of Brahma, since more pious merit is required to reach it. syedi emit doinw is stil a'dend lo 
One can achieve the world of Brahma by pious acts or by adher- ence to religious principles. If one has even greater piety, he can attain the realm of Rudra. In the previous anuccheda, Kṛṣṇa described to Uddhava the various destinations attained by the fol- lowers of varṇāśrama, belonging to different asramas. To reach Vai- kuntha, however, one has to be free from both the gross and subtle bodies, which means Vaikuntha lies beyond both gross and subtle dimensions. 
m 
To prove this, Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī cites a verse spoken by Lord Rudra to the Pracetas in which Vaikuntha is described as avyākṛta, free from external divisions or modifications, or in other words, one, 
2 
unmodified nondual Reality. Chandogya Upanisad uses the word 
nama-rūpe vyākaravāņi 
597 
blW Śri Bhagavat Sandarbha ley 
vyākṛta to mean "manifest from the state of non-manifestation," or in other words, "a caused event" - I shall bring into manifestation (vyākṛta) the divisions or modifications of name and form" (nama- rūpe vyākaravāņi, CHU 6.3.2). The subsequent Chandogya mantra describes material objects produced by the three gunas of nature, which have names and forms. Vaikuntha is not a manifestation of the three gunas, and is thus called avyākṛta, not a caused event, not something brought into the state of manifestation, which is to say that it is eternally self-manifest. Jiva Gosvāmī gives the word, pra- pañcãtita, "beyond the visible or manifested cosmos," as a synonym for avyākṛta. diw sonsbrose ni salg fart of by sw.bayoresh 
Vaisnavam padam means the abode of the Complete Whole, Śrī Viṣṇu, known as Vaikuntha. The presiding deities of universal affairs attain that abode after they complete their tenure and are free from the subtle body, kalatyaye. Kala means the subtle body. 
In his commentary on vs 3.3.33, Śrī Baladeva Vidyabhūṣaṇa writes that the devas, like Brahma, have burned their accumulated karma in the fire of transcendental knowledge, but some prärabdha- karma remains owing to their desire to assist the Lord in adminis- tering universal affairs. Brahma becomes liberated at the end of his term. Other gods who are free from karma proceed to Brahma's planet after their tenure is over. They remain there until the end of Brahma's life, at which time they are liberated along with him. Kurma Purana confirms this:della bhowed avoid 
adiwasig 
gifon 
When Brahma's tenure is over and the great dissolution occurs, all lot perfected beings enter the abode of the Lord along with Brahma. 
(Kurma Purana 1.12.273) 
This proves that Vaikuntha is beyond Satyaloka and thus beyond the manifested cosmos. Incidentally, it should be noted that unlike devas or other pious beings who attain Brahma's post, a devotee fully established in the Lord's internal potency and thus free from the gunas does not have to wait until the end of Brahma's life span to enter into Vaikuntha. After giving up the present body, he is

immediately transferred to Vaikuntha, having become one in nature and constitution with that transcendental realm. 
In the next section, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi will show that no one ever falls from Vaikuntha.

(3) NO ONE FALLS DOWN FROM THAT ABODE (tato'skhalanam). Śrī Kapiladeva says: 
अथो विभूतिं मम माययाचितामैश्वर्यमष्टाङ्गमनुप्रवृत्तम् । 
श्रियं भागवतीं वास्पृहयन्ति भद्रां परस्य मे तेऽश्नुवते तु लोके ॥ २७४ ॥

Thereafter, they do not hanker after any opulence stored for them by My māyā, nor for the eight ensuing yogic paranormal pow- ers, nor even for the transcendental glory of God, and yet these benign gifts become effortlessly available to them in My supreme abode. (SB 3.25.37)1

The word athah (thereafter) means, "after the removal of igno- rance." The term "by My maya" (mama mayaya) means, "by My mercy upon the devotee." Acita (stored) means, made manifest or

available for the sake of those devotees. Vibhuti (opulence) refers to paraphernalia appropriate for enjoyment, and aiśvarya, to the eight yogic paranormal powers (aṣṭāngaiśvarya), such as aṇimā (atomization). These powers systematically ensue (anupravṛtta), i.e., it is their very nature to be made available [as a consequence of pure devotion]. The devotees do not desire any of the above, nor even "the transcendental glory of God" (bhagavatim śriyam), which here refers to the majesty known as sārṣṭi, or in other words, those divine opulences that are particular to the Lord Him- self. The reason why they don't desire any such opulence is that they yearn only to expand God's own bliss through abandonment to all-consuming devotional love and service. Even though they have no desire for any of the above-stated gifts, they certainly enjoy (aśnuvate) them, meaning that they become fully available to them, in My supreme abode (loke) known as Vaikuntha.

Kapiladeva's verse also shows the devotees' disinterest in these opulences. The phrases, "after the removal of ignorance" (athah), and, "stored for them by My mercy" (mama mayayācitam), indi- cate that such opulences are in no way detrimental to them. Fur- thermore, by saying, "stored by My maya" (mayayācita), Kapila- deva indicates that all opulences, including those of the highest realms like Brahmaloka, are fully available to such devotees, as experiential possibilities, yet they make no use of them, consider- ing them completely devoid of significance or substantiality and thus unsuitable for their use.

The phrase santa-rupe (of unalterable peace) refers to the sup- reme abode, Vaikuntha [mentioned in the previous verse], which is peaceful by nature, meaning that it is free from all change or alteration that could disrupt the continuity of peace. All those who reside there know themselves and feel themselves to belong to Me entirely (mat-parāḥ). They are never destroyed (no nankṣyanti), which means they are never bereft of the [afore- mentioned] experiential possibilities. "My unblinking wheel" (animişo me hetih), i.e., My discus in the form of time, does not devour them (no ledhi). As stated in the Śruti, "He does not return" (CHU 8.15.1).

words, most excellent, from which there is no going (ayana), meaning, wherein there is no fear of return (punar-āvṛtti-sanka- rahita), and so it is called Parayana." If the term appears in the masculine gender, then it should be taken as a bahuvrihi com- pound, i.e., as an epithet of the Lord [rendering this sense, "the Lord, whose supreme abode is free from return"]

Freedom from the fear of fall or destruction is not the full extent of the devotees' glories. Śrī Kapila elucidates further in the sec- ond half of the verse: "those for whom I am the total Beloved, their very Self, son, friend, preceptor, relative, benefactor and worshipable Lord." This means that for such devotees there is no Entity other than Me [the Lord], for whom their love exists. Alternatively, the statement can be taken as a reference to Goloka [instead of Vaikuntha], because only there do the gopas, endowed with the full range of such attitudes, eternally reside.

Then again, the last two lines of the verse can be taken as a reply to the question, "What kind of people attain that abode after being freed from ignorance?" The idea is this: Some people, like the sages described in the Uttara-khanda of Padma Purana, desire Me as their beloved husband (priya), while others, like the four Kumāras, consider Me as "their very Self" (ātmā), i.e., directly as Brahman; yet others relate to Me in the other ways mentioned; only such persons [who know themselves as belonging to Me entirely, through any of these dispositions] can attain Vaikun- tha. The word suhṛdaḥ, "bosom friend," is in the plural, because such friends are of various kinds.

Śrī Nārada speaks in a similar vein in the Fourth Canto: 
शान्ताः समदृशः शुद्धाः सर्वभूतानुरञ्जनाः । 
यान्त्यञ्जसाच्युतपदमच्युतप्रियबान्धवाः || २७९ ।। इति ।। श्रीकपिलः ।। 
Those established in unalterable peace, who are equanimous, pure and who please all other living beings, effortlessly go to that abode from which no one falls down (acyuta-padam), for they keep friendship with the dear devotees of the infallible Lord. (SB 4.12.37) 
Commentary 
IN THIS SECTION, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī proves that no one falls to the material world from Vaikuntha. In other words, Vaikuntha is acyuta-pada, a place devoid of falldown. Anuccheda 61 estab- lished that Vaikuntha is not attained by karma, since it is beyond time, which destroys everything achieved by karma. Time, how- ever, does not influence the transcendental realm. Thus, Śrī Kapi- ladeva instructs His mother-no'nimişo ledhi hetih. The wheel of time devours neither the devotees residing in Vaikuntha nor their opulences. 
Time, however, does exist in Vaikuntha, not as a material influ- ence of mutation and destruction but as a transcendental potency fully under the Lord's control, providing unique moments for the unfolding of His pastimes. We saw in Anuccheda 10 Brahma's state- ment, from his personal experience, that "time has no control over Vaikuntha" (na ca kāla-vikramaḥ, SB 2.9.10). This means that every- thing in Vaikuntha is eternal. Anuccheda 47 explained this in respect to Śrī Kṛṣṇa's birth and other actions. 
The Lord and His actions are eternal, which means that the devo- tees and their actions are also eternal, since they are related to the

Lord. If we accept that a devotee falls from Vaikuntha, we must assume he falls eternally, which means the falling never comes to an end. And if it does not come to an end, it means that he never reaches the material world. If a jīva can fall, then Vaikuntha must be concluded to be like any other material place. 
To refute this misconception, Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmi begins by cate- gorically stating: tato'skhalanam - There is no fall from Vaikuntha. Since Jiva Prabhu is discussing the inherent nature of Vaikuntha, it is understood he is not referring only to those devotees who go there from the material world. No śastric evidence indicates that there is any distinction between the devotees who arrive in Vaikuntha from the material world and those who have been there eternally. Vai- kuntha manifests its inherent nature uniformly to all the resident devotees. It is not that it is a place of anxiety for some and a place of peace for others. Therefore, Śrī Kapila says śānta-rupa - its nature is that of unalterable peace, without trace of any influence that could disrupt the continuity of such peace. 
The verb nanksyanti (will meet with destruction), is used in con- nection with the particle of negation, na karhicin, meaning "this will never occur." This is highly significant. The residents of Vai- kuntha, without exception, never lose their opulence. Therefore, Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī writes unequivocally - tad-vasino lokāḥ kadācid api na nankṣyanti bhogya-hina na bhavanti - the residents of Vaikun- tha are never destroyed, meaning they are never bereft of their opu- lence. This naturally means that no resident of Vaikuntha falls to the material world. 
Śrī Kapila submits two reasons for this in the second verse cited: First, time has no influence in Vaikuntha. The second and more important reason is that all residents of Vaikuntha have an eternal loving relationship with Bhagavan (sthayi-bhava). This relation- ship is not material and is never lost or covered. Beyond that, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi says that the Lord has so much love for His devotees (vātsalya-viseṣa) that He gives them all opulence even though they do not desire it. Hence, there is no possibility that anything could violate the will of the Lord to deprive the devotees of their opu- lence. To dispel the doubt that spiritual opulence might cause the 
606 
63 No One Falls from Vaikuntha 
devotees to forget the Lord, as is the case with material opulence, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī says, teṣām anartha-rupatvaṁ khanḍitam - these opulences are in no way detrimental to them. Section 22 explained that mayă acts by first concealing the awareness of the living being (jiva māyā), and then by alluring him through projection of the world appearance (guna-māyā). It is not possible for this to hap- pen in Vaikuntha, since māyā does not exist there - na yatra māyā (SB 2.9.10). Devotees are not hindered by ignorance in Vaikun- tha, and their opulence is a manifestation of Bhagavan's mercy - mayayācita (SB 3.25.37). Here maya means the mercy of the Lord, as stated in the Viśva-prakāśa dictionary - māyā dambhe kṛpāyām ca-māyā can mean "deceit," or "mercy." 
The above verse therefore states na nankṣyanti, which indicates that transcendental opulences can never be destroyed. The Lord is eternal; as such, relationships established with Him are also eternal. It is clearly confirmed herein that relationships with Him cannot be destroyed, and thus it follows that opulences stemming from those relationships can also never be destroyed. 
To clarify the topic further for those who cling still to doubt, let us assume that a devotee could somehow or other fall from Vaikun- tha. The obvious question that arises is, "How could such a thing occur?" One may say that transcendental events are causeless and thus there is no reason. But how can falling be considered transcen- dental? Transcendental action yields transcendental results, and falling into the material world cannot be considered transcenden- tal. Hence, by the principle of phala-bala-kalpa-nyaya (understand- ing a cause by its results), it is concluded that such a fall can only be material. Thus, falling has a beginning and end, which character- izes it as a material occurrence; so again, it cannot be regarded as transcendental. 
bes 
A question that naturally arises in this regard is, "How can a material event originate in the spiritual world?" It has been proven here in many places, specifically in Anucchedas 10 and 62, that Vai- kuntha is beyond the material world, free from the influence of time and from the gunas of nature. In response, one may argue that the origin of this event is not material, but when the living being crosses 
607 
lyŚrī Bhagavat Sandarbha 
the boundary, out of Vaikuntha, the action becomes material. This is, of course, absurd. Transcendental entities do not get converted from spiritual to material. Moreover, Vaikuntha is unlimited - it has no bounds. It is ananta, as stated in Bhagavatam: Am 
ge 
down old gohulle ydemarit 
This abode is truth, consciousness, the unlimited, the indestruc- tible spiritual effulgence that silent sages witness in their trance of spiritual absorption after the material qualities have been effaced. (SB 10.28.15)10 
ow 
Vaikuntha is all-pervading, just like the Supreme Lord, who exists everywhere and never leaves His abode. This means that His abode exists everywhere. The material world cannot contain the extent of His being. Thus, the Śruti asks, "Where is the Lord situ- ated?" and answers, "in His own glory," meaning in His own abode (CHU 7.24.1)." mi daw bedaildates ideas 
Objection: But if Vaikuntha is unlimited, how is it that we do not see it or exist in it? And why is it said that when a devotee is liberated, he leaves the material world and enters into the spiritual world? 
Answer: We do not experience Vaikuntha because our conscious- ness is absorbed in and identified with matter. Going to Vaikun- tha actually means becoming of the nature of Vaikuntha (sat-cit- ananda), or in other words, to exist exclusively in and for Kṛṣṇa, to be fully conscious of Him in every arising moment, to radiate His own potency of bliss in order to expand His personal bliss. A televi- sion has many channels, yet while tuned to a particular channel, we cannot see programs shown on other channels. Transmission waves of numerous channels are broadcast into the atmosphere and are received by the television; we then choose which one to view, and it appears on the screen. Similarly, there are basically two channels in existence, Vaikuntha and maya, and a person views one or the other according to his or her particular state of consciousness.up A

exists everywhere. Falling down is possible only if a devotee falls under the influence of material consciousness, and this is not possible in Vaikuntha, since matter does not exist there. 
If we accept that the jiva falls from Vaikuntha, we must admit it is a material event from beginning to end. Although a material act cannot occur in Vaikuntha, let us assume for the sake of argument that it could somehow happen. Falling can have either a material or a spiritual cause. Below are six conditions often thought to precede a falldown, followed by a discussion of the conditions in greater detail. 
1. The jiva wishes to come to the material world, inspired by his free 
will. 
2. He commits sin. 
3. He is cursed by a devotee or the Lord. 
4. He offends a devotee.ffde t 
5. He offends the Lord. 
6. The Lord decides to make him fall, as He is free to do as He likes. 
It is not possible for a devotee to fall from Vaikuntha for any of these reasons. Here is why: 
(1) The devotee's very nature, svarupa, is to be in undiminish- ing, unbreakable, all-consuming love for God, to long only for His bliss through naturally arising service in devotion. Such devotees do not desire material or spiritual opulence without devotional service, because, in fact, they desire nothing independent of Bhagavan. Their will, too, being of the same transcendental nature, exists simply for the pleasure of the Lord. This is the import of Śrī Kapila's statement, quoted above, "They do not hanker even for the transcendental glory of God" (śrīyam bhagavatim vaspṛhayanti). Furthermore, spiritual opulences, and for that matter, even material opulences, are fully available to them as experiential possibilities at every moment, by the mercy of the Lord (mama mayayācitām, SB 3.25.37). So why yearn for that which eternally sits in the palm of one's own hand? 
Elsewhere, Śrī Kapila states: "Without being assured of My ser- vice, a pure devotee does not accept any kind of liberation, whether it be residence on the same planet with Me (sälokya), opulence equal to Mine (sārști), proximity to Me (samipya), endowment with a form 
609 
Śri Bhagavat Sandarbha 
identical to Mine (sarūpya) or becoming one with Me (ekatvam), even though I may offer these to him" (SB 3.29.13).12ltet ads shinin 
The phrase vină mat-sevanam here means, "without My service." This means that a devotee would accept one or more of these dif- ferent types of liberation only if they prove conducive for his ser- vice to the Lord, but not for independent enjoyment. A devotee cer- tainly has no desire to come to the material world. Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi says that devotees have no interest in material enjoyment because they consider it completely devoid of significance or substantial- ity - tasyatitucchatvena. Why should a discerning person abandon a touchstone to acquire a piece of glass (kāca-mani)? On the contrary, a devotee never conceives, even for a moment, of leaving Kṛṣṇa's lotus feet. Everything else is simply of no interest. 
King Parīkṣit confirms this while speaking to his spiritual teacher: 
A person whose heart has been washed clean never abandons Krsna's lotus feet. Like a traveler who has arrived home, he is relieved of all distress. (SB 2.8.6) 13

In Section 7 of Priti Sandarbha, Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī writes that one should not think that Jaya and Vijaya chose to become enemies of the Lord in order to quickly relieve themselves from the curse of the Kumāras - na ca tayor eva svāparādha-bhoga-sighra-nistärärtham api tādṛśīcchā jāteti vācyam. Pure devotees of the Lord do not accept even salokya-mukti if it is bereft of bhakti, and are prepared even to go to hell for the sake of bhakti. Indeed, Jaya and Vijaya's only request was, "But we pray that Your compassion be invoked on see- ing our penitence, so that as we descend ever downward, we will

not be overtaken by the bewilderment that causes forgetfulness of the Lord" (SB 3.15.36).14 and sites to added 
Thus, for a Vaikuntha resident to give up Bhagavan's service and voluntarily come to the material world is highly illogical and against scriptural conclusions. 
9171 
The Lord has endowed the devotees with freedom of will for the purpose of serving Him, not for leaving Him. Śrī Kṛṣṇa says that everyone follows his own nature, and that it is very difficult to give it up (GĪTĀ 3.33). This is also commonly experienced by everyone. So, if abandoning one's acquired, and hence spurious, material nature is so difficult, how much more difficult would it be for a resident of Vai- kuntha to give up his eternal, and hence true, nature - the nature to love and serve the all-conscious, all-blissful, all-encompassing Being to whom we eternally belong! Just as fire cannot exist without heat, a pure devotee in Vaikuntha cannot exist without service. 
Freedom of will does not mean acting frivolously, nor does it imply having the power to manifest whatever it is one may desire (i.e., omnipotence). We have freedom of will, but even if we desire to do so, we haven't the power or capacity to stand on our own shoulders. Moreover, the mere fact that drinking poison is within the range of decision making possibilities doesn't mean that a per- son would likely choose to do so. How then would a Vaikuntha resident choose something that is altogether outside their range of experience and interest? 
(2) There is no possibility of committing sin in the spiritual world. Sin and piety exist only in the material world, both being products of the gunas of nature. A devotee in the spiritual world is situated in his eternal inherent nature (svarupa), free from mate- rial covering or ignorance-muktir hitvanyatha-rupaṁ svarūpeṇa vyavasthitiḥ (SB 2.10.6). Mukti means to give up the subtle and gross bodies and become situated in one's original nature. In Bhagavad Gitā, Śrī Kṛṣṇa explains that all sins are burned in the fire of transcendental knowledge: 
14 må vo'nutapa-kalaya bhagavat-smṛti-ghno 
moho bhaved iha tu nau vrajator adho'dhaḥ 
611 
Śrī Bhagavat Sandarbha 
Even if you are the most sinful of all sinners, you will be able to cross t Fover the ocean of miseries in the boat of knowledge. As a blazing fire reduces fuel to ashes, O Arjuna, so does the fire of knowledge reduce all karma to ashes. (GĪTĀ 4.36–37) 15 
Some rare souls who are completely devoted to Lord Vasudeva ere totally destroy all their sins by their exclusive devotion, just as 
the sun immediately dissipates fog with its rays. (SB 6.1.15)16 
This point was also described in Section 47 of Tattva Sandarbha, in regard to the explanation of Vyasa's trance: 
By hearing this Srimad Bhagavatam, one is blessed with devotion to Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Person. This devotion puts an end to all mourn- gating, bewilderment and fear. (SB 1.7.7)op-leadi svisa bine-o 1690 Jood 
Śrila Jiva Gosvāmi's commentary on this verse explains that even the most subtle impressions of sin are destroyed. Śrī Kṛṣṇa Himself instructed Śrī Uddhava in this same principle: 
Uddhava, just as a blazing fire turns firewood into ashes, devotion to Me completely burns My devotees' sins to ashes. (SB 11.14.19) 18 aidsiw al noalog nilalab Jedi 1989150 avosno 
vosnoM shluon 19 The word kṛtsnaśaḥ (completely) is important. It means that igno- rance, which is the root cause of sin, is also completely destroyed along with the external effects of sin. 
(3) There is no possibility that a devotee would curse another devotee in Vaikuntha. A devotee never desires to harm anyone, what to speak of another devotee. Prahlada Mahārāja says that a devotee is endowed with all auspicious qualities: 
15 api ced asi păpebhyaḥ sarvebhyah papa-kṛttamaḥ

All the gods come and invest their qualities in one who is devoted to the Supreme Lord without independent interest or desire. On the other hand, where are the great virtues of a person not devoted to Śrī Hari, whose desires lead him to wander about in the superficial and impermanent realm? (SB 5.18.12)19 
A devotee has no desire to harm even those who consider him their enemy. Prahlada Mahārāja is the ideal example. He remained concerned about his father's welfare even though the latter tortured and tried to kill him in various ways. Devotees are peaceful, tolerant, merciful and always disposed toward everyone's welfare. Śrī Kapila 
confirms this: 
918 001 you 
OnThose established in Truth are tolerant, merciful and friendly to all beings; their enemy is never even born, and so they are situated in unalterable peace. Such persons are jewels amongst the virtuous. (SB 3.25.21)20 
TSV There are some stories in the Purānas wherein devotees curse each other, but this is just to set the scene for the unfolding of the lila, and no truly inimical feelings are present. Even when devotees come to the material world as a result of a curse, they are not placed under the influence of the gunas of material nature. They remain for the prescribed duration and assist in the Lord's bhauma-līlā, or mani- fest pastimes on earth. Jaya and Vijaya's descent to the earth was not the result of the curse of the Kumāras; it was impelled by the will of the Lord:

The Lord said to His attendants, Jaya and Vijaya, "Go, but fear not. May peace be with you. Though I am capable of stopping od the brāhmaṇas' curse, I do not wish to do so. In fact, I approve of it." (SB 3.16.29)21

Just as those who visit a prison do not become prisoners, so those devotees who are so-called "cursed" to come to this material world to assist the Lord in His lila are not bound by the gunas of nature. The associates of Bhagavan are almost as powerful as Bhagavan Himself, as stated in Bhagavatam: 
They saw Him with eyes resembling a pair of full-blown autumn balotuses, and surrounded by His sixteen associates, who appeared be exactly like Him, only without the mark of Śrīvatsa and the 
Kaustubha jewel. (SB 6.9.29)22 
aliq 
The word atma-tulyaiḥ in this verse means that the Lord's asso- ciates are just like His very own Self. This means that they too are merciful, just like Him, and thus they never desire to harm anyone. 
(4) AND (5) A perfected devotee never commits an offense. Offenses are committed due to ignorance, resulting from forget- fulness of the Lord. Offense (aparādha) means an act that causes displeasure. A siddha devotee never forgets the Lord, and he never desires to displease Him; he thus never commits offenses, know- ingly or unknowingly. He is guided by the internal potency of Bha- gavan, just as a conditioned being is always under the influence of the external energy. The internal energy is always favorable to the Lord. 
odial seher has noitshub bedhoesig s Jon In Madhurya-kādambini, Śrīla Viśvanatha Cakravarti Thakura has made a minute analysis of offenses while describing a devotee's progress from śraddha to prema. In the third chapter, he explains that when a devotee has attained prema, he is completely free from all types of offenses, and that when he attains the lotus feet of the Lord, there is not even the slightest possibility of committing an offense. 
For the enlightenment of those who think Mahārāja Citraketu offended Lord Śiva after having attained the darśana of Śrī Sankar- ṣaṇa, Viśvanatha writes that the king did not really offend Lord Siva. He gives more details on this in his commentary on chapter 17 of 
22 
atma-tulyaiḥ ṣoḍaśabhir vinā śrīvatsa-kaustubhau paryupäsitam unnidra-sarad-amburuhekṣaṇame

63 No One Falls from Vaikuntha 
the Sixth Canto. The effect of an offense is that one's affection for the Lord diminishes, but we see that even after King Citraketu took birth as Vṛtrāsura, he retained his love for the Lord. According to Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī (BRS 1.3.54), an offense committed to the Lord's dear devotee can cause one's bhava, or permanent devotional dispo- sition of being, to be lost altogether, transmuted into a mere sem- blance (bhāvābhāsa), or downgraded to a lower bhava, depending on the gravity of the offense. But none of these things can happen once a devotee has attained the platform of prema. The conclusion is that a perfected devotee who has attained the Lord is free from all offenses. Readers can also refer to Priti Sandarbha, Section 7, for more details. 
(6) The last possibility is that Bhagavan Himself sends a devotee away. This is also impossible, except in cases where He deliberately sends one of His eternal companions to the material world for the purpose of assisting Him in His pastimes. The Lord positively told Durvāsā Muni: 
O brāhmaṇa, I am completely under the control of My devotees, as if I had no independence at all. My heart has been fully captivated by My virtuous devotees, for I am their only beloved.

How could I possibly abandon those sadhus who, for My sake, have given up home, wife, children, family members, wealth, life and all hopes for happiness in this world and the next? 
I am conquered by the virtuous whose hearts are tied to Me while showing equanimity to all beings, just as a virtuous wife wins over her pious husband's love. 
My devotees are completely satisfied by their service to Me. They have not even the slightest interest in the four kinds of liberation (sälokya, särüpya, samipya and särsți) automatically available to them as a mere side effect of their service. How could they yearn for anything that is destroyed by time? 
615 
Śri Bhagavat Sandarbha 
I am the heart of the devotees and they are Mine. They know nothing $66other than Me, and I, nothing other than them. (SB 9.4.63-68) 23 Aih 
These verses lucidly describe the Lord's intense affection for His devotees. They were spoken with respect to Ambarīṣa Mahārāja, who was in the material world, so imagine how much more they must apply to devotees who are supremely perfect and have been eternally rendering service to the Supreme Lord in transcendental bodies, within the spiritual domain. Kṛṣṇa assured Arjuna in similar fashion: 
Ils most sa ai botoi banienezed odw sotovoh boot 
ali 
O son of Kunti! Such a devotee very quickly becomes righteous and attains eternal peace. Therefore, declare it loudly: My devotee will never perish. (GĪTĀ 9.31)24 
ad This verse is spoken in reference to devotees in the material world who accidentally engage in abominable action, sudurăcăra. Even they do not fall into the material conception of life. Inauspi- ciousness does not exist for devotees of the Lord (MB 13.149.131). 
It has thus been shown that none of the above conditions that could hypothetically lead to a devotee's falldown exist even as pos- sibilities in Vaikuntha, for it is the place free from all such fear. One may still, however, suspect that there may be non-devotees in Vai- kuntha to whom such arguments do not apply. Such persons could fall down due to any of the six aforementioned possibilities, could they not?

We reply that there are no non-devotees in Vaikuntha. As stated earlier, mukti means being free from foreign elements and being situated in one's own svarupa. The nature of the living being is spiritual - he is a part of Kṛṣṇa. This means he is a servant of the Being who is his Source. As stated in PP 6.226.37, "The living being is exclusively a servant of Lord Hari and nothing else."25 
No one can enter or remain in Vaikuntha unless he has attained devotion for the Lord. Śrī Rṣabhadeva confirms this: 
When the living being is covered by tamo-guna, his mind is sub-q ject to result-oriented action. Therefore, the jiva cannot be released from attachment to the body until love dawns for Me, Śrī Vasudeva. (SB 5.5.6)26 
In the principal verse (SB 3.25.38) of this anuccheda, spoken by Śrī Kapila, it is said that devotees have different relationships with the Lord. According to Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmi, there are five basic rasas, or aesthetic experiences, that the Lord enjoys with His devo- tees. These varieties of aesthetic experience are rooted in, and arise out of, five foundational moods of loving devotion. Out of these five, the devotees immersed in peaceful devotion, or santa-rasa, have the least intensity of love for Bhagavan. Nonetheless, they are completely devoid of material desires and have strong faith in Him. Santa-bhaktas cannot be considered non-devotees, nor is there any possibility of their falling down. 
In commenting on this verse (yeṣam aham priya ātmā sutaś ca sakha guruh suhṛdo daivam iṣṭam), Śrīla Viśvanatha Cakravarti says that those who consider the Lord as priya, or the beloved, refers to devotees in amorous devotion madhurya-rasa; similarly, those who consider Him as ātmā, the Self, refers to those in peaceful devotion (śānta-rasa); suta, or son, to those in parental devotion (vātsalya- rasa); and sakha, friend, to those in devotional friendship (sakhya- rasa). Those who consider Him as guru, in this case a respectful elder, refers to devotees with a specific type of respectful devotion (dāsya-

rasa); suhrd, bosom friend, to devotees in a specific type of devotional friendship (sakhya-rasa); and the words ista, the worshipful Deity, and daiva, the Lord, to those in different kinds of respectful devotion (dāsya-rasa). 
The words santa-rupe, the abode of unalterable peace, in the same verse, mean that Vaikuntha is beyond the material gunas (viśuddha- sattva). Although Vaikuntha is a place, its nature is identical to that of the Lord - eternal, conscious and blissful - and it is thus unlike any material place. The opulence of the devotees in Vaikuntha never perishes. That is to say, they never descend to the material dimen- sion. This is confirmed by hundreds of verses both in Śruti and Smrti. The Chandogya Upanisad states: 
Drawing his senses within, he does not cause violence to any being, other than in circumstances of mortal danger where scripture may call for appropriate aggression. Remaining in this condition till the pra moment of death, he attains the spiritual abode. He does not return. ov He does not return. (CHU 8.15.1)27 
9257 
Śrīla Vyasa Muni concludes Vedanta-sutra by repeating the words, "There is no return [from Vaikuntha] because the scriptures declare this as truth" (anavṛttiḥ śabdad anavṛttih śabdāt, vs 4.4.22). 
Śrīla Baladeva Vidyabhūṣaṇa, while commenting on this sutra, confirms the same by quoting the following mantra from Chandogya Upanisad: 
He leads them to Brahman. This is the path of the godly (devas) that By leads to the Lord. Those who walk on this path do not return to this 
human life. Surely they do not come back. (CHU 4.15.5)28 
Śrī Baladeva Vidyabhuṣaṇa says that Bhagavan is determined not to abandon His devotees, and His devotees are equally determined to love Him. Thus, they can never leave Him. One should never doubt this.

There are many other such verses in Bhagavad Gitā.

Despite the clarity of this evidence, one might claim that the above verses mean that those who reach Vaikuntha from this mate- rial world never return, and that only those who have never been to this material world can fall down. In other words, those who achieve Vaikuntha have experienced the miseries of the material world, but the nitya-siddhas are ignorant of these and are subject to falldown. The logic is that a person who has burned his tongue with hot milk is so careful that he even blows on buttermilk before drinking it. 
This is an inconsistent argument. Before reaching Vaikuntha, the devotee casts off his gross and subtle bodies. The experience of the material world remains in the subtle body, so the devotee does not carry it with him. In the material world we carry a stock of impressions in our subtle body, but how much of it do we remem- ber? Indeed, we cannot recollect most of the things we have done even in this lifetime. How then is it to be expected that a liberated being would remember the miseries of the material world? And why would he? What is the gain? Is the remembrance of past material miseries more captivating than the immediate and present ecstasy of service to the Lord? Whenever sustained joy fills a person's life, memories of past pain or suffering fade into the background.

Moreover, even if the devotee, after attaining Vaikuntha, wanted to recall his former material experience, he no longer has a subtle body in which all the impressions would be stored. Those memories are wiped clean without a trace. In BRS 1.1.23, Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmi writes that bhakti destroys all varieties of karma. 
H 
It has been shown logically that falling from Vaikuntha is not pos- sible under any circumstances. Nor is there any scriptural evidence to support such an event. However, there are many scriptural texts to the effect that it is impossible to fall down from the spiritual world, regardless of whether one has resided there eternally or has attained it after many lifetimes in the mundane world. 
Still, to address any possible remaining doubt, we ask, "Have the nitya-siddhas attained Vaikuntha or not?" If the answer is in the affir- mative, then they cannot fall down. If they have not, where are they? They must be in Vaikuntha; otherwise, they are not nitya-siddhas. So how is it that they exist in Vaikuntha, but have not attained it? Or is it that they are not in Vaikuntha? If yes, then there is no falldown; and if no, then there is no falldown. 
The reason most verses dealing with this subject use verbs like "having attained," or "after reaching," is because these instructions are meant for the conditioned beings. The Lord has no need to say this to the nitya-siddhas. First, the nitya-siddhas are not in ignorance of this knowledge. Second, when something is denied, it indicates the possibility of opposite action. If the Lord were to tell a nitya- siddha, "You will never fall because you are my devotee," this would imply the possibility of falldown; otherwise, why the reassurance? But the Lord never says that one can fall from Vaikuntha (nor do they have any experience of this), and thus there is no need to reassure the nitya-siddhas. But Bhagavan does assure the conditioned persons that His abode is distinct in nature - it is a place of no return. He does this because conditioned beings know from scriptures that one can and does fall from the heavenly planets. 
Scriptures inform us about subjects that are unknown to us and which we are unable to know by ourselves - śāstro'jñāta-jñāpakaḥ. Scriptural instructions are meant for the conditioned beings. Per- fected persons are called nirgrantha (SB 1.7.10) and dūre yamāḥ 
62063 No One Falls from Vaikuntha 
(SB 3.15.25), "beyond the rules and regulations of scripture." Śrī Kṛṣṇa says, "You will step beyond everything that has been heard or is to be heard" (GITĀ 2.52)31 Pure devotees hear scriptures to relish the Lord's pastimes, not to be given assurance that they will not fall. For them there is no difference between heaven and hell (SB 6.17.28)32) 
Therefore, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī says tato'skhalanam - Vaikuntha is a place of no falldown. He did not say "a place of no return;" other- wise, he could have said tato'navartanam. He knows very well the difference between the two statements. Vaikuntha is called acyuta- pada (SB 4.12.37). This can either mean the place of Śrī Acyuta, or the place from where no one falls. Acyuta is a name of the Lord which means, "One who never falls," and also, "One whose devotees never fall" (na cyavati cyavayati va ity acyutah). This is confirmed in Skanda Purāṇa: 
His devotees do not fall down even during the great dissolution; therefore, He is supreme, imperishable and omnipresent in all the planetary systems. (Skanda Purana 4.20.10)33 
00 
os doidw 
(Thus, Kṛṣṇa's abode is here referred to as acyuta-pada- the place of no falldown. Śrī Kṛṣṇa says: 
No effort on the yoga path is ever lost, nor can any obstacle ever hold one back forever. Just a little progress on this path can protect one from the greatest fear. (GITA 2.40)34 ob gaidismos westbni or (stes) atslund 
Another objection could be raised: Conditioned beings are called patita, or fallen, and this implies that previously they were not fallen. When we say, "This is a mashed potato," it means that it was not mashed previously. So, although we are unable to understand how we fell, we must have; otherwise, we would not be designated as "fallen." The Supreme Lord, Caitanya Mahaprabhu, in the mood of a

devotee, says that He has fallen into the ocean of birth and death patitam mam visame bhavambudhau (Sikṣāṣṭaka 4). If we have fallen, it must have been from Vaikuntha, because every other place is already a fallen position. ved de ton sunthangaba den 
The defect in this argument is the assumption that the fallen con- dition is preceded by a non-fallen state. If one's falldown has no beginning (anadi-patita), then that person is also called patita, as there is no other word to describe such a state. The adjective anādi is not always used. An adjective distinguishes one object from oth- ers in the same class and identifies a specific quality belonging to a particular object. For example, when we say "red lotus," we are specifying that this lotus is different from blue or yellow ones. Nev- ertheless, the red lotus is also a lotus, and can be referred to simply as such when there is no need to distinguish it from others. Simi- larly, when patita is used without the adjective anadi, it refers to all fallen living entities. Hell is a fallen place and there was never a time when it was not fallen. Calling it a fallen place does not imply that it was not previously fallen. 
Patita is a past participle, which according to Panini's grammar is formed when the kta suffix is added to the verbal root √pat (to fall). This suffix is called a niṣṭhā (PANINI 1.1.26) and is applied in various ways, some of which are described below: 
1. To indicate something done in the past (PANINI 3.2.102) - as in 
bhukta (eaten). 
62. Used actively, it indicates the beginning of an activity (PĀŅINI Fod 3.2.102, värttika 3). For example, prakṛtaḥ katam devadattaḥ, 
aw "Devadatta begins to make the mat." and 
63. The sense of present tense action applied to verbal roots which end in a mute ñ, as well as to roots having the sense of desire, knowledge and worship (PANINI 3.2.187-88). E.g., rājñām iṣṭaṁ (desirable by kings). 
4. As a verbal noun, such as hasita (laughter). When used in this 
way, the word is always in the neuter gender (PANINI 3.3.114). 5. When the word ending in kta is used as a name, as in devadatta, it carries the sense of a benediction (PANINI 3.3.174 and its Käsikä- vrtti).

622 
63 No One Falls from Vaikuntha 
(as The suffix kta, therefore, is not always used to indicate the past. When patita is used to indicate a conditioned being, it means he or she is in an eternally fallen state. In commenting on Ujjvala- nilamani 15.187, wherein he demonstrates the eternality of Bhaga- vān's pastimes, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi explains the meaning of sannihita, which is also a past participle formed in the same way, by adding the suffix kta to the verbal root √dha. He says that in that reference the kta suffix is used in the sense of the present tense, lat-pratyayavat kta-pratyayasya. 
To substantiate his view, Jīva gives an example from the Śruti, "The Lord is free from sins" (ayam ātmāpahata-pāpmā, CHU 8.15.1). The word apahata is formed with the kta suffix and when combined with papma, it literally means, "He has warded off or destroyed sins." Does this mean that the Lord was previously sinful? No. Here the kta suffix signifies eternality, without any beginning. Thus, the statement means that the Lord is eternally free from sins. 
The kta suffix has also been applied in the term pratilabdha, which was used to indicate eternality when the Lord spoke to the Kumāras: 
On account of My service to you, the dust of My lotus feet has become so pure that it immediately destroys all sins, and I have acquired such a disposition that Lakṣmi Devi, for whose sidelong glance oth- ers observe all manner of rules and regulations, never abandons Me, though I am indifferent to her. (SB 3.16.7) 35 
Here the Lord says, "I have acquired such a disposition" (pratilab- dha-sila). This certainly does not imply that once upon a time He did not have such a disposition. 
The word bhakta, a devotee or worshiper, is also formed by adding the kta suffix to the verbal root √bhaj (to worship). This word does not necessarily imply that the devotee it refers to was previously a non-devotee. Eternal associates of Bhagavan, like Nanda Mahārāja, are bhaktas. Does this mean they were non-devotees once upon a

time? Therefore, it is incorrect to assume that the word patita (fallen) implies a previously liberated state. than baril alting is W Talo The eternal associates of Bhagavan, such as Mother Yasoda, are liberated beings, nitya-mukta. The word mukta is also formed with the kta suffix. However, it does not imply that all liberated beings were previously fallen. Similarly, patita (fallen) or baddha (bound), which are both past participles, may still indicate an eternal (i.e., beginningless) condition when used to describe the state of a jiva in the material world. It does not mean that those who are fallen were previously liberated. 
But our disputant may set forth yet another objection: If this sec- tion is properly analyzed, we can conclude that it refers only to those devotees who reach Vaikuntha from the material world. This can be ascertained by studying the six items that determine the import of a text, such as its opening and closing statements. These are described in the following verse: 
The true import of a text can be decided by these six criteria: (1) that which is stated at the beginning and the end; (2) that which is repeated throughout the text; (3) that which is unique to it; (4) that which is stated to be the result; (5) that which is praised; and (6) that which is established by logical argument.36 
The disputant may argue that the opening verse, concluding verse and the Upanisad mantra quoted in the section currently under discussion, all refer to the jiva who attains Vaikuntha from the material world. 
Answer: This type of analysis is applied only when ambiguity exists about the subject of a book, chapter or essay. But such is not the case here. It is clearly evident that Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī is dis- cussing the qualities of Vaikuntha. He listed nine characteristics of Vaikuntha in Section 61, and is now explaining them in detail. In this present section, he is arguing that one of Vaikuntha's divine charac- teristics and proofs of its transcendental nature is that no one falls from there (tato'skhalanam).

arthavădopapatti ca lingam tätparya-nirnaye 
624 
63 No One Falls from Vaikuntha 
Moreover, even if one follows the method of analysis recom- mended above and concludes that the subject of the section is that those who attain Vaikuntha from the material world never again fall, this does not prove that eternal associates fall. This section makes no such statements, directly or indirectly, and to form such a conclusion is highly improper. On the contrary, the second verse spoken by Śrī Kapila (SB 3.25.38), clearly states that Kṛṣṇa's devotees are never bereft of opulence. Jiva's intention in quoting it is to say that they never fall. 
Yet another objection may be raised: The cycle of creation and destruction of the material world is beginningless and has thus occurred innumerable times. During the maintenance period, some jīvas occasionally attain liberation. If living beings continue to exit the material world and no new ātmās enter by falling from Vai- kuntha, then the universe should have been empty by now. Thus, according to this reasoning, it would be logical to assume that an equal number of ātmās fall from Vaikuntha to replace those who achieve liberation from the material world. 
Answer: Such a concept results from ignorance of the unlimited nature of the Lord. There are unlimited material universes, and each contains unlimited living beings. Unlimited means that when some are removed, an unlimited number still remain. Even in mathemat- ics, infinity minus infinity equals infinity. There are an infinite num- ber of points existing in a line that extends from point A to point B. If this line is divided into two parts, say AC and CB, each line still con- tains an infinite number of points. 
Moreover, the logic of the objection ultimately backfires. If nitya- siddhas fall to replace the jivas who achieve liberation, and those who go to Vaikuntha from the material world never come back, then, as time is beginningless (anadi), by now all the nitya-siddhas would have fallen into the material world and returned to Vaikuntha, and there would be no virgin nitya-siddhas left to fall. Thus, the material world would be empty. Obviously this imagined state is far from the truth; otherwise, I would not be here writing this commentary. 
The prayers of the personified Śrutis (SB 10.87.30) acknowledge that there are unlimited or countless living beings (aparimita). In 
625 
Śri Bhagavat Sandarbha 
commenting on this verse, Śrīla Sanatana Gosvāmī quotes Vajra Mahārāja's question to the sage Märkandeya: 
O brahmana, because time has no beginning, therefore even if only one person achieved liberation in each of the bygone kalpas, wouldn't the world be empty by now? (Visnu-dharmottara Purāņa 1.81.12)37 
Märkandeya's answer is as follows: 
the mate 
ban 
Tha 
When someone is liberated, the Supreme Lord, who possesses unlimited potency, brings forth (sargena) another jiva and thus always keeps the world full. Those beings who achieve Brahmaloka become liberated along with Brahma. Then in the next cycle of creation (maha-kalpa), the Lord emits (srjyante) similar beings. Material nature and the living beings should be understood to be beginningless. Their transformations and the gunas of matter are products of material nature.38 
Therefore, there is no need to assume that living beings fall from Vaikuntha to replace the liberated beings. The important word in Markandeya's reply is acintya-sakti, or inconceivable power. This has been discussed in greater detail in earlier sections of this book. Without accepting the existence of this astonishing potency of the Lord, one can never hope to understand Him in truth. 
A doubt may be raised, however, in regard to Markandeya's state- ment. Living beings are said to be beginningless (anadi). Why then does Märkandeya say that the Lord brings forth (sargena) other jīvas? 
Śrīla Sanatana Gosvāmī answers that there are unlimited dor- mant living beings, which the Lord activates as He desires. This is what is meant by the term "brings forth" in the above verse. The word sarga, or creation, does not mean producing new living beings. This siddhanta is accepted by all Vaisnavas. Actually, the

626 
63 No One Falls from Vaikuntha 
verb sriyante (He creates) is used here to mean "emits." It comes from the verbal root √srj visarge, which can be used to mean either "to create," or "to emit." Since the first meaning would contradict many other statements asserting that the jiva is never created, we must take the second meaning here. Srjyante then means to release the jiva from the dormant state into the active condition. 
So the conclusion is that nobody, whether nitya-siddha or sadhana-siddha, ever falls from Vaikuntha. The question that nat- urally follows is, "So then, where do we come from?" or, "How did we come to be in this bound condition?" The simple answer is that we are nitya-baddha (perpetually bound), which is to say that till now, and indefinitely onwards till the moment of liberation, we have always been bound by the material energy, due to ignorance of who we are and what God is. There was never a time when we were not involved with material nature. Material nature as well as the living beings are anadi, or beginningless, as Śrī Kṛṣṇa says in Bhagavad Gitā: 
Know that prakṛti, or the material energy, and purușa, or the bconscious being, are both without beginning. Know, however, that the modifications and the gunas are produced from prakṛti. (GĪTĀ 13.19)39 
The word anadi (beginningless) is very important in this verse. Not only are the living beings and material nature beginningless, but so also is their correlation. Śrila Viśvanatha Cakravarti Thakura and Śrīpāda Baladeva Vidyabhuṣaṇa confirm this fact in their com- mentaries, tayoḥ samsleṣo'py anadir iti bhavaḥ. More details on this subject will be presented in Paramātma Sandarbha. 
Objection: But there are verses in Śrimad Bhagavatam which clearly state that the living being was with the Lord and then fell down, such as: 
Do you remember your self from your previous state, when you were with your friend named "Unknown"? You left Me, seeking mate-

Rorial acquisition, being attached to worldly sense pleasures. O noble 
one, you and I are two swans, two friends, who have been living toll together in the Manasa Lake for many thousands of years (sahasra-o ew parivatsaran) far from our original home. (SB 4.28.53-54)40 
First of all, there is no mention of falling down from Vaikuntha in these verses. The commentaries of previous ācāryas clearly indicate that these verses refer to the jiva residing with Mahāviṣṇu during the total annihilation. The words sahasra-parivatsaran (SB 4.24.54), "for a thousand cycles," confirms this fact, since the period of anni- hilation is equal to a thousand cycles of the four yugas. "Giving up My company," means taking birth in the next cycle of creation. Nārada Muni told the story of Purañjana to King Präcīnabarhi explic- itly as an allegory, so it should not be taken literally. It is indirect expression (paroksya), as stated by Narada himself: 
O King Barhişman! I have shown you these spiritual truths in ant indirect manner, through allegory, because Bhagavan, the Source of the cosmos, is fond of indirect expression. (SB 4.28.65)41 
In this verse, the words pārokṣyena (in an indirect manner) and paroksa-priya (fond of indirect expression) must be noted. 
From the above analysis, based on the authority of sastra, it is concluded without doubt that the living being does not fall from Vai- kuntha. Yet for the benefit of those who have not been exposed to the full breadth of the Bhāgavatam's view, as revealed to us by Jiva Gosvāmi, here is a fresh analysis of this topic from yet another angle. 
in In Tattva Sandarbha, Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī accepted three pramāņas, evidence or valid means of knowing, while establishing the Gauḍīya Vaisnava epistemology. These are sabda (revealed sound), anumāna (inference), and pratyakṣa (direct perception). All evidence from sabda clearly indicates that the jiva does not fall. Pratyakṣa and

628 
63 No One Falls from Vaikuntha 
anumäna shed no light on this topic. Pratyakṣa, or sense percep- tion, has no validity in the ascertainment of transcendental matters, which by definition lie beyond the purview of the senses. Logic, on the other hand, which is part of anumana, can be used in analyz- ing scripture. Logic that conforms to sastra is acceptable as a valid means of knowing. 
pleqs off gathutembra o apst Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmi, in defining the characteristics of an uttama- adhikari, writes:star 
by One who is expert in logic, argument and the revealed scriptures, -ils who has unflinching determination and firm faith in Krsna, is the 
person most eligible to achieve bhakti. (BRS 1.2.17)42 
Here, yukti means logic and argument. Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī com- ments that the logic referred to here is that which conforms to scripture. To clarify, he quotes a verse from a Vaisnava Tantra:43 
Appropriate logic is that which is used to reach the proper conclu- sion on the strength of understanding prior and subsequent state- ments of sastra. Dry logic [or in other words, logic devoid of such truth-visioning] should be rejected.** 
Thus, logic and argument are not bereft of value. They can assist us to understand the conclusion of scriptures and to resolve apparent contradictions. It is not uncommon to find contradictory statements in scriptures. For example, the Vedas state, "One who observes the vow of caturmasya attains imperishable merit."45 
Yet, in another place it is stated, "Just as the results of material action do not endure, so are the results attained in heaven by the performance of good deeds" (CHU 8.1.6).466)

Naturally, both statements cannot be absolute. In other words, the observation of caturmasya does not directly lead to imperishable merit, but only to the indirect possibility of such. So the statement is neither false nor true in its primary sense. A secondary mean- ing must be applied to one of the statements in order to reconcile them. By understanding the speaker's intention, deliberating on the results of sakāma-karma, and studying the many statements indi- cating the temporary nature of heavenly existence, one can under- stand that the first statement is not absolute. It is meant to inspire those who are materially identified and attached to fruits to observe the religious ceremony of caturmäsya. In the course of such reli- gious observances, they may contact a living sage and be graced with pure knowledge, and thus attain liberation. Śrī Kṛṣṇa confirms this principle in Bhagavad Gitä: 
O chastiser of the enemy! Better than the sacrifice of material pos- sessions is the sacrifice of knowledge. O Partha! All action attains completion in transcendental knowledge. (GĪTĀ 4.33)47 
1012 
People in general are attached to the fruits of their actions. So, if scriptures were to categorically reject all karma and its fruit, and make allowance for pure devotion alone, the religiously inclined, yet materially driven, who cannot yet adhere to pure devotion, may lose faith even in karma-yoga. So, Śrī Kṛṣṇa advises: 
Do not unsettle the minds of the spiritually unaware who are attached to fruitive action. A person of wisdom, while attentively engaged in action, should engage the materially attached in all manner of action. (GĪTĀ 3.26) 
Teaching is an art. An expert teacher is one who educates in such a way that the students embrace the teaching as their own, without confusion or degradation. The conditioned beings, being unaware of any other reality, do not aspire to become free of the material world, but would rather be happy in this life, or at best, in some future heaven. Yet a compassionate teacher is moved to help relieve

63063 No One Falls from Vaikuntha 
them of their material identification. Hence, there is an apparent clash of interest. To overcome this, the discerning teacher often has to devise a strategy, just as parents may conceal medicine within candy to induce their sick child to take it. In the Pūrva-mīmāmsā, this is called parisankhyā-vidhi, or using an injunction to accomplish something other than the apparent aim. Hence, it is not always easy to understand the intent of scriptures. The sage Avirhotra confirms this: bol omsoque alia 
eru 30 
Prescriptions, prohibitions and transgressions of prescribed duty Ware to be known from the Veda and not just through hearsay. Since the Veda is the direct revelation of God, even the devas are confused about these three types of actions. The Veda speaks indirectly. Its di breal import is to impel one to transcend karma and its fruits, but all it prescribes karma for the ignorant, just as a child is tempted with sweets in order to make him take a bitter medicine. (SB 11.3.43-44)48 
Mere citing of references will not establish the truth conclu- sively. One has to analyze the scriptures thoroughly and objectively to understand the actual intent hidden within the hoards of recom- mendations for fruitive action, and to reconcile the various apparent contradictions. One must appropriately resolve all apparent contra- dictions by properly understanding the relative strength of various scriptural statements. Not all scriptural statements carry equal weight or authority; some can override others. For example, the famous statement, kṛṣṇas tu bhagavan svayam, "Śrī Kṛṣṇa, however, is Himself the complete personal nondual Absolute" (SB 1.3.28), is recognized as an "emperor statement," or maha-väkya. It overrules all other statements that describe Kṛṣṇa as an avatara of someone else. This statement is not whimsically accepted to be of the highest authority, but is established as such in accordance with accepted rules of logic. This will be demonstrated in Krsna Sandarbha. 
Of the four chapters of Vedanta-sutra, the first is called saman- vayādhyāya, or the chapter on reconciliation, since the purpose is

Śri Bhagavat Sandarbha 
to reconcile the numerous apparent contradictions in the various Upanisads. So, the tradition of using tarka, or appropriate logic, is well established, and Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī has rightly accepted it as a means to establishing the śastric conclusion. The point is that the conclusions reached must not contradict scripture. 
One approach to analyzing a philosophical conclusion is by observing whether there is conformity between sadhu, śästra and guru. Of these three, śästra stands supreme. Indeed, without śās- tra we cannot even know the true characteristics of the other two. The degree of completion and truth-resonance, or the falsity, of any teaching, even those of various avataras, can be assessed based on a thorough and cross-contextual visioning of all scripture. It is on the authority of śästra that the teachings of Lord Buddha, for example, are identified as pertaining strictly to non-theism, even though He is taken to be one of the avataras of Visnu (which is to say, almost with a tinge of irony, that Buddha is God teaching that there is no God). At the same time, however, we must not forget that śästra is understood through the medium of guru and sadhu. This makes the process a little more complex than it may first appear. Without receiving instruction in an authorized parampară, one will easily get lost in the jungle of scripture. 
We have seen the śastric conclusions regarding the topic under discussion. These are accepted by all other Vaisnava sampradayas without any quibbling. Our stalwart ācāryas, like Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi, Śrīla Viśvanatha Cakravarti Thakura and Srila Baladeva Vidyabhu- şana confirm this view, and thus the sadhus are in agreement. On the other hand, we can find no scriptural statements and no com- mentary by a previous ācārya that describe a fall from the spiritual world. A sampradaya is based on the conclusions of prasthana-trayi, or Śruti (Upanisads), Smrti (Bhagavad Gita) and Nyaya (Vedanta- sūtra). We see that the prasthana-trayī does not support that the jiva can fall from Vaikuntha. In Vedic culture every authorized sam- pradaya establishes their siddhanta based on prasthana-trayi, and any conclusion inconsistent with this standard is considered to be apasiddhanta, or a heterodox view. Sometimes it is suggested that the jiva falls due to being envious of Kṛṣṇa. But as declared earlier, 
632 
63 No One Falls from Vaikuntha 
māyā is not present in Vaikuntha, so from where could such envy arise? In GĪTĀ 13.7, the Lord says that hatred, or envy, is connected to the material body. to manqabatutul spovedt blood 
Some argue that envy arises by seeing Kṛṣṇa enjoying with the gopis. But it is explained that devotees derive far greater pleasure from serving other devotees, who are in direct association with Kṛṣṇa, than from direct service to Him. Śrī Caitanya prayed to become a servant of the servant. Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu considers following in the footsteps of the residents of Vraja to be the highest mood of service. Moreover, Caitanya-caritamṛta says that the gopis derive ten thousand times more pleasure by seeing Kṛṣṇa than He does by seeing them. So how could any devotee feel dissatisfied at being a servant? This would mean that the well-propounded devo- tional conclusion of becoming a servant of the servant is defective. Ultimately, this notion indicates a defect in Kṛṣṇa for not being able to satisfy His servants. Moreover, not everyone serves Kṛṣṇa directly, so it would imply that there are a lot of envious devotees in Vaikuntha. 
Śrimad Bhagavatam states that pure bhakti is free from all types of cheating, and is meant only for non-envious devotees.49 The Lord also promises in Bhagavad Gitā, "I arrange for the provision of what they lack and the preservation of what they have."50 So when the devotee is by nature free from envy, and in fact all forms of ego- centrism, and the Lord has unlimited capacity for provision and care, how could anyone feel dissatisfied, become envious and leave? 
Moreover, if the jivas do fall, do they do so only from Kṛṣṇaloka, and not from other Vaikuntha planets? Were this the case, then Kṛṣṇaloka would have to be considered inferior to the Vaikuntha planets, owing to its being less secure. This proposal contradicts scriptures like the Brahma-samhita, which describes Kṛṣṇaloka as the highest realm. Secondly, if everyone falls from Kṛṣṇaloka only, why is it that later on some become devotees of other avataras, like

Rāma, or Nrsimha, and end up in Vaikuntha? This would mean they are not going back to their original home, but to a new home. How could they change their natural disposition of love for Kṛṣṇa to some other avatara?

Were it possible to fall from Vaikuntha, Yudhisthira Mahārāja's question to Narada Muni regarding Jaya and Vijaya's descent would be meaningless: 
wih moit ner 
What kind of horrible curse could affect even liberated Visņu bhak- tas, and what sort of person could curse even the Lord's associates? For unflinching devotees of the Lord to take birth in this mate- rial world is impossible. I cannot believe this [story of Jaya and Vijaya's being cursed]. The bodies of the inhabitants of Vaikuntha are completely spiritual, having nothing to do with the material body, senses or life air. Therefore, kindly explain how associates of the Supreme Person were cursed to descend in material bodies like Weordinary people. (SB 7.1.33-34) 5120Madame

The concept of nitya-baddha, or perpetually bound, is not easy to grasp. Comprehension normally functions by processing ideas and events with reference to our material experience, which concerns objects and actions that have a beginning and an end. If the word nitya (eternal) in nitya-baddha is applied strictly, it would imply that the bondage of the jiva is without beginning or end. All wisdom tra- ditions accept that the jiva can be liberated from bondage. Therefore, nitya does not apply to the future in the sense of endless. Rather, it implies indefinite continuance till the moment of awakening. Now, if an ātmā were to fall from Vaikuntha, their bondage would begin at that point, in which case the term nitya would have no bearing in respect to the past. So from the perspective of both future and past, the term would lose all significance. Then why use the word nitya at all? Or why use the word anadi (beginningless), in nitya-baddha and anãdi-karma, when the fall signals a definite beginning? Why not just say that we are baddha instead of saying nitya-baddha?

Some interpret the term anadi in a non-technical sense as time immemorial. This lack of precision, however, is misleading because it implies that the origin of our conditioned state cannot be traced simply because it occured so long ago. That is not the case. Rather, we cannot trace the beginning because it is without beginning. How can you trace out something that does not even exist, since mate- rial bondage is in truth nothing other than the beginningless non- existence of awareness of the Real? yed to al sdiquiliel 
If one falls from Vaikuntha, how can it be considered superior to the material heavenly planets? One may answer that everyone without exception must fall from heaven, but only those who have never been to the material world are subject to falling from Vaikun- tha, so it is superior in this sense. But where is the śastric evidence for such a proposal? Vaikuntha is a place free from anxiety. The threefold miseries do not exist there. The residents there do not suf- fer from the pangs of birth, death, disease and old age. If the threat of falling from there existed, the residents would be in anxiety about it. And the more joy a resident experiences there, the more anxiety he would feel at the prospect of losing it. Since the bliss experienced in Vaikuntha is superior even to the bliss of Brahman (brahmananda), the anxiety of losing it would have to be immense. But who would accept that Vaikuntha is a place of anxiety, much less, the place of supreme anxiety? What to speak of falling down, one can not even slip, which is why Śrī Jiva Gosvāmī has used the word askhalana and not apatana! 
So, the conclusion is that the living being does not fall from Vai- kuntha. The good news is that although we are nitya-baddhas -- perpetually bound - we can achieve liberation and become nitya- muktas.

IN THE FOLLOWING VERSE, Śrī Sūta Gosvāmī simultaneously describes both qualities of Vaikuntha [discussed in the two pre- vious sections]. It is beyond the visible or manifest world and is a place from which no one falls down: "O twice-born, the Lord's umbrella is His spiritual abode, Vaikuntha, where there is no fear" (SB 12.11.19). From the context in which this verse is found [i.e., within a description of the Lord's form within the cosmos], it is understood that the umbrella referred to in the verse belongs to His form as seen in the material world. [Though appearing in the material world, even that umbrella is Vaikuntha, which is to say that it is beyond matter.] Dvijāḥ (twice-born), is an address: "O brāhmaṇas!"

Commentary 
BRYDD vll 
ŚRILA JIVA GOSVĀMĪ AGAIN DISCUSSES the characteristics of Vai- kuntha mentioned in the previous two anucchedas. Akuto-bhaya (where there is no fear) is a characteristic of Vaikuntha. The term literally means, "where there is no fear from any direction, or from 
1ātapatraṁ tu vaikuntham dvijā dhāmākuto-bhayam 
636 
64 Vaikuntha Is Both beyond Matter and a Place of No Falldown 
any cause." Time is the most feared thing, as it devours everything; in the material world, time ultimately means death and the fall from acquired status. As there is no such fear in Vaikuntha, it is qualified by the word akuto-bhaya. Therefore, this word suggests two of Vai- kuntha's qualities - it is beyond the material world and no one falls from there. 
Again, it should be noted here that this second quality of Vai- kuntha is not restricted purely to those devotees who go to Vai- kuntha from the material world. Neither Sūta Gosvāmi nor Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī make any such distinction. The Lord's umbrella is described as Vaikuntha, for it protects the living beings from all kinds of suffering. Śrīla Viśvanatha Cakravarti Thakura comments that when one experiences fearlessness in the material world, it is an effect of this umbrella of the Lord. 
The Vaikuntha described in this verse appears within the mate- rial world. This is understood from Saunaka's questions to Sūta 
Gosvāmī: 
May auspiciousness attend you. We are eager to know the means of dynamic worship (kriya-yoga), through mastery of which a mor- tal can attain immortality. Please explain to us, therefore, in what manner the tantrics meditate, in the course of worship, on the limbs, associates, weapons and ornaments of the Lord, who is the husband of the Goddess of Fortune and the absolute consciousness. Please tell us also of what elements [tattva] they conceive all of these to be constituted? 
Kriya-yoga here refers to deity worship. Saunaka Rṣi wants to know how devotees meditate on the limbs, ornaments, dress and so on, of the Deity in relation to the material elements. The umbrella mentioned in the verse under discussion is the one that is used in the deity worship of Śrī Viṣṇu.

In the Krama-sandarbha commentary to these verses, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi writes that the Vaikuntha referred to here is situated above Brahmaloka and was manifested by the son of Vikuntha. It is to be thought of as the umbrella of Śrī Nārāyaṇa. This was manifest during the reign of Raivata Manu, as Śrīla Suka describes: 
Vikuntha was the wife of the sage Subhra. From their union the Lord Himself appeared in His own partial self-expansion as Vaikuntha, along with the best of the gods who were also known as Vaikunthas. Being requested by the goddess Rama (Lakṣmi), the Lord, desiring to please Her, manifested a planet named Vaikuntha, which is revered Ile by all the worlds. (SB 8.5.4-5)4370g ti to uliye

Śrī Bhagavat Sandarbha 
Commentaryandarbha 
ŚRĪ KRṢNA TAUGHT UDDHAVA about the gunas of nature and their effect on human beings in the Eleventh Canto. He explained that the destination one reaches depends on the influence of the gunas at the time of death. Śrīdhara Svāmi comments here that the Lord refers to the influence of the guna that is in ascendance over the other two, because the gunas are always intermingled. 9971 
Another interesting point to be noted in this verse is that, although the word lina or laya (destruction, dissolution or death) is used to qualify those who pass away in each of the three gunas, neither of these words is used as a qualifier for those who are nir- guna. Nirguṇaḥ means those devotees or worshipers whose self is completely offered to Bhagavan, without any separate-self sense remaining. The Lord's own internal potency of devotion fills such a receptive and available ātmā, rendering the worshiper of the same nirguna nature. This indicates that such pure devotees are in a state beyond the gunas even while living, and thus they attain the Lord in this very life. It is for this reason that they are deservingly called jīvan-muktas (the living liberated). They surely reach the abode of the Lord after giving up the body. The word eva (only), in măm eva (i.e., "they attain Me alone"), negates any other possibility. sod

Vaikuntha Is the Shelter of the Nirguna State 
66.1 
६६ । सुतरां नैर्गुण्याश्रयत्वम् (भा० ११ ।२५।२५) – 
(5) SINCE VAIKUNTHA IS ATTAINED ONLY BY THOSE established in freedom from the gunas, it is certainly the shelter of the nirguna state (nairgunyaśrayatva). The Lord says: 
वनं तु सात्त्विको वासो ग्रामो राजस उच्यते । तामसं द्यूतसदनं मन्निकेतं तु निर्गुणम् ॥ २८१ ॥ 
The forest is a sättvic residence; the city, a rajasic residence; and the the gambling house, a tamasic residence; whereas, My residence All (i.e., My temple) is free from the gunas. (SB 11.25.25)' 
तदावेशेनैवास्यापि निर्गुणत्वव्यपदेश इति भावः । 
The import is that the temple is referred to as nirguna only because of the Lord's presence within the building. 
Commentary 
ŚRI KRṢNA EXPLAINED TO UDDHAVA that nairgunya, or the state of absence of the gunas of nature, is sheltered in Vaikuntha. Niketa means a temple. Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi explains that the temple is free from the gunas owing to the presence of the Lord in the form of the 
1

Śri Bhagavat Sandarbha 
Deity. It naturally follows, then, that places where Bhagavan has appeared, such as Vṛndāvana, are also nirguna. What then can be said of Vaikuntha, where He eternally resides in His original form? The implication is that while residing in the temple, devotees who are fully conscious of the Lord and devoted to Him remain free from the material gunas. 
cherborn A 
In his Krama-sandarbha comment to this verse, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi adds that just as iron is converted into gold through contact with a touchstone, similarly, the Deity's presence transforms a physical structure into a temple, or in other words, a transcendental resi- dence. He adds, however, that most people do not see the temple as transcendental because they lack the eye of devotion? 
66.2 
स एव प्रकृतेः परत्वम् (भा० १० १८८।२५-२६) – 
(6) Vaikuntha is transcendental to material nature (prakṛteḥ paratvam), as Śrī Sūta said: 
ततो वैकुण्ठमगमद् भास्वरं तमसः परम् । 
यत्र नारायणः साक्षान् न्यासिनां परमा गतिः ॥ २८२ ॥ शान्तानां न्यस्तदण्डानां यतो नावर्तते गतः ॥ २८३ ॥ 
Then [Śiva] reached the effulgent Vaikuntha, beyond all dark- vinness, where Śrī Nārāyaṇa Himself resides. It is the destination of renunciants who are established in peace and who have given up all violence toward other beings, whereupon going, one never returns. (SB 10.88.25-26)3 
अगमत् जगाम शिव इति शेषः ॥ श्रीशुकः ॥ 
Agamat means [he] went. The word siva is needed to complete the 
sense.

66 Vaikuntha Is the Shelter of the Nirguna State 
Commentary 
Vaikuntha is beyond material nature, as explained by Śrī Suka while narrating the characteristics of Viṣṇu, Brahma and Śiva. Vṛkāsura, the son of Śakuni, performed great austerities at Kedara to appease Lord Siva. But even though he offered his own flesh in the fire, Lord Śiva still did not appear before him. Finally, Vṛkāsura decided to sever his own head and offer it in the fire, but as he prepared to do so, Lord Śiva stopped him. Śiva offered him a boon, and Vṛkāsura asked that he be given the power to kill anyone simply by touching them on the head. Upon being granted this boon, Vṛkāsura decided to test it out on Sankara himself, in the hope of enjoying Pārvati. 
Understanding Vṛkāsura's wicked intent, Śiva fled to various planets in search of protection, but no one could help him. Finally he reached Vaikuntha, which is described here as effulgent and as tamasaḥ param, beyond the guna of ignorance. This latter adjective has been used only for Vaikuntha and distinguishes it from other planets of the material world. 
Since the gunas of nature are always intermingled, the term "beyond the guna of ignorance" means beyond all three gunas (since the complete absence of any one implies the complete absence of all three). Bhāsvara, or luminous, means that Vaikuntha is self- effulgent, conscious and free from the gunas (nirguna). It is the sup- reme destination for the santas, those firmly established in unwaver- ing devotion, or in other words, those whose consciousness remains ever uninfluenced by the gunas of nature. Upon reaching that place, one does not return to this world. Thus, no one falls from Vaikuntha.

Commentary 
67 Vaikuntha Is Eternal 
EVERYTHING IN THE MATERIAL WORLD is made of matter and is tem- porary. Since Vaikuntha is beyond the material world, it is eternal. In chapter 5 of the Second Canto, Śrī Brahma explains the process of meditating on the various planets as limbs of the Lord's body. Śrī Brahma tells Narada that the universal egg (brahmaṇḍa) is a form of the Lord, and that everything up to Satyaloka, the topmost mate- rial planet, is temporary. Vaikuntha, however, is eternal. Lord Siva confirms this while speaking to Parvati: 
In this way, O daughter of Himalaya, I have explained the most splendid opulences of material nature. Now listen to the wonderful opulences of the supra-mundane region. Between the unmanifest material nature (pradhana) and the spiritual sky exists the Viraja river, the auspicious current of water generated from the perspira- tion of the Vedas personified. Beyond this is the spiritual sky, called d tripăda-vibhuti, which is eternal. It is supreme, immortal, unchang- ing, unlimited and never diminishes. This divine abode of the Lord cois unfathomable and exists in the state of unalloyed being (śuddha- 
sattva). (PP, Uttara-khanda 6.227.58-60)3

(8) VAIKUNTHA IS ATTAINABLE only through bhakti, which belit- tles the bliss of liberation (mokṣa-sukha-tiraskari-bhakti-eka- labhyatva), as was stated by Śri Brahma to the gods: 
1 
यन् न व्रजन्त्यघभिदो रचनानुवादाच्छृण्वन्ति येऽन्यविषयाः कुकथा मतिघ्नीः । यास्तु श्रुता हतभगैर्नृभिरात्तसारास्तांस्तान् क्षिपन्त्यशरणेषु तमःसु हन्त ॥ २८५ ॥ यच् च व्रजन्त्यनिमिषामृषभानुवृत्त्या दूरेयमा ह्युपरि नः स्पृहणीयशीलाः । भर्तुर्मिथः सुयशसः कथनानुरागवैक्लव्यबाष्पकलया पुलकीकृताङ्गाः ॥ २८६ ॥ 
Those who listen to worthless topics that destroy intelligence and which concern matters other than the descriptions of the divine lilas of the Lord, who destroys all sin, do not enter Vaikuntha. Instead, those other topics, when heard by these unfortunate peo- ple, rob them of their essence and cast them into the regions of darkness where there is no shelter. (SB 3.15.23)1 
Reaching that abode, which is situated beyond us, are those who are beyond the jurisdiction of Yama by virtue of their service to the foremost of all the gods. Their behavior is to be aspired for, The since their eyes fill with tears of love and their bodies thrill, as together they relish the exploits of the glorious Lord. (SB 3.15.25)2

The relative pronoun yat refers to Vaikuntha, which is situated beyond even us (i.e., the gods like Brahma). Or, the pronoun "us" can be syntactically connected to the phrase, spṛhaniya-siläḥ (their behavior is to be aspired for), i.e., "by us." The words dūre yamāḥ can be understood either as meaning that they are beyond the jurisdiction of Yamaraja, or that due to having attained per- fection, they are beyond all rules and regulations (yamas and niyamas). Only such persons go to Vaikuntha.

The phrase, "together they relish the exploits of the glorious Lord" (bhartur mithaḥ suyaśasah) indicates the well-known truth that devotion of this kind surpasses even the bliss of liberation. This is confirmed further on by the Kumāras in SB 3.15.48, where they say, "Those who have taken shelter of Your lotus feet, who are expert in speaking of You, whose glories are purifying and worshipable, and who have experienced the sweet taste [of devotion...] have no regard for liberation."3

Commentary 
ch 
BRAHMAN IS ETERNAL and can be attained only by one who is free from the gunas of nature. The bliss of Vaikuntha, being the abode of Bhagavan, the complete Absolute, endowed with unlimited tran- scendental potencies, is far superior to that of liberation in unquali- fied Brahman, which is mere oneness devoid of variety. In liberation in Brahman, consciousness does not experience material miseries anam de zini ni betoup Ex meni brod

and remains in a passive state because the material ego is dissolved. Thus, liberation in Brahman basically refers to the zero-point of material being. It is uniformity of being only, and thus it is but the outer glow of nondual or transcendental being. In that indetermi- nate state, one cannot taste the positive bliss of serving the Supreme Person. In Vaikuntha, however, the internal potency endows the devotee with a spiritual body, with the self identity of belonging to the Lord and existing entirely for Him, and with a particular rela- tionship with the Lord, through which the devotee loves and serves Him. This leads to countless naturally arising blissful exchanges between the Lord and His devotee. This state is attained only by pure devotional service. To illustrate this, Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī cites two verses spoken by Śri Brahma to the devas, while describing the birth of Hiranyākṣa and Hiranyakasipu. 
Brahma explains that Vaikuntha cannot be reached by those immersed in worthless topics that do not concern the Real. Such topics rob a person of all piety because they are without connection to the Lord's pastimes. The Lord's līlās are purifying (punya-śravana- kirtana, SB 1.2.17). Materialistic people, however, think them a waste of time because they have lost their intelligence through hearing and speaking about sense pleasure (kukatha mati-ghnī, SB 3.15.23). They are drawn primarily to topics concerning sexual attraction, and this leads them further into darkness and ignorance (tamo- dvāram yoṣitām sargi-sangam, SB 5.5.2). Narada Muni compares such mundane talks to the refuse eaten by crows: 
Those words, which though wonderfully composed do not con- 997 tain the glories of the Lord, who is capable of purifying the whole aboworld, are relished by sensuous people who are comparable to crows 
that feed on refuse. Swan-like devotees never take delight in such descriptions. (SB 1.5.10)* 
asdil 
According to Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi, agha-bhit (the destroyer of sin), the epithet of the Lord in SB 3.15.23 quoted in this section, means "Kṛṣṇa, the killer of Aghasura." When pastimes, such as Kṛṣṇa's

killing of the demon Aghasura, are faithfully heard, all sins are dis- pelled from the heart. Śrī Jiva is implying here that hearing Śrī Kṛṣṇa's pastimes is more purifying than hearing those of all His avatāras. And yet, unfortunate people do not take interest in hear- ing them even after achieving this rare human form. Śrī Kapila laments for such ātmās: 
anole

Those who reject the nectar of the infallible Lord's topics are con- demned by Destiny. They choose to hear about temporal matters and any are thus comparable to stool-eating hogs. (SB 3.32.19)5 
vd s 
In the second verse quoted in this anuccheda, Śrī Brahmā glorifies those who are enraptured by hearing and chanting about the Lord. Such people are described as dūre yamah, beyond the jurisdiction of Yamarāja, who instructed his servants not to approach the devotees of the Lord. Even Śrī Brahmā desires to follow in the footsteps of such devotees (nah spṛhaniya-silah), who alone have the eligibility to enter Vaikuntha. 
In Särärtha-darśini, Śrīla Viśvanatha Cakravarti Thakura dis- cusses the accounts found in some Purāņas of asuras who tem- porarily went to Vaikuntha. His conclusion is that these demons do not experience Vaikuntha's transcendental qualities, so their going there is tantamount to not going at all. When Kṛṣṇa allows an asura to enter Vaikuntha, it can be compared to a king allowing a tamed tiger, decorated with various gems, to enter the assembly hall for entertainment. Sometimes the Lord allows material objects or people influenced by the gunas to be brought to Vaikuntha for the experience of His transcendental associates. Such instances include Bhrgu Muni and the Kumāras. As they are not qualified to stay there, they are sent back immediately. The Lord's devotees, however, are taken to Vaikuntha in transcendental airplanes and enjoy eternal residence and loving relationships with Him. 
Therefore, in Jitante-stotra of Närada-pañcarātra, Śrī Brahmā 
says: 
motion Hators 
nunam daivena vihata ye cacyuta-katha-sudhām hitva śṛṇvanty asad-gāthāḥ purīṣam iva vid-bhujah

aib The world called Vaikuntha is replete with six types of opulence and The devoid of the three gunas of material nature. It can never be attained 
by non-devotees. 
ab 
Because devotees derive so much bliss from their mutual discus- sions of the Lord and His pastimes, they frown on the so-called bliss of homogeneous liberation in Brahman. This is confirmed by the Kumāras, the best of the jñānis, who directly experienced Vaikun- tha and the dealings between the Lord and His devotees. After the Kumāras cursed Jaya and Vijaya and realized the personal form of the Lord, they spoke SB 3.15.48, also quoted here by Śrī Jiva Prabhu. They realized that the taste of Hari-katha is far superior to brahmā- nanda. Previously, they were absorbed in the bliss of Brahman but gave it up, having found something superior. They spoke directly from their experience and not from hearsay. Śrī Sukadeva had a similar experience and said: 
O King Parikşit, generally the topmost transcendentalists, who are beyond prescriptions and restrictions, take pleasure in recounting the attributes of the Lord. (SB 2.1.7)" 
In this verse, Sukadeva describes the general tendency of liber- ated beings to awaken attraction for the Lord's pastimes, but then goes on to speak of his own direct experience. Therefore, one should not think that his case is exceptional: 
O saintly King, although I was situated in transcendence beyond the Sigunas, my heart was captivated by the delineation of the pastimes of shithe Lord, and so I took up its study. (SB 2.1.9) 
In this verse, the word nairgunya (freedom from the gunas of material nature) refers to the liberated state. Thus, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi concludes that since the bliss of devotion is superior to 
lokam vaikuntha-nāmānam dviya-sad-guna-samyutament avaiṣṇvānām apräpyaṁ guna-traya-vivarjitam prayeņa munayo rajan nivṛttä vidhi-şedhataḥ

that of impersonal liberation, and since Vaikuntha can be attained only through such devotion, its transcendental glories can be easily inferred.

In either of the two verses quoted above, it would be a mistake to imagine that there is ellipsis of the conjunction ca (and), and that it must therefore be added to complete the sense [in a farfetched attempt to suggest that Brahman and Kṛṣṇa's abode are two dif- ferent realities]. Śrīdhara Svāmī has himself explained that the phrase "beyond the darkness of material nature" (tamasaḥ param) qualifies Vaikuntha. 
Commentary 
burtizni of babasoorg ned sH 
IN SECTION 62, ŚRILA JIVA GOSVĀMI SAID that Vaikuntha is beyond the material world, and then in Section 66.1, that it is nirguna, or free from the material gunas. All this necessarily implies that Vaikun- tha is sat-cit-ananda. Nevertheless, he here sets out to prove this point explicitly. Radical Nondualists do not accept that Vaikuntha is a transcendental realm, because they are predisposed to interpret all form as limitation. This itself becomes an imposition of limitation

Śrī Bhagavat Sandarbha 
on the Absolute because they deny it even the possibility of transcen- dental form. Thus, they consider unqualified Brahman alone to be the supreme destination. At best they take Vaikuntha as a synonym for Brahman, or mukti. 
Generally, the Radical Nondualists think Vaikuntha to be subor- dinate to Brahman and a product of maya. According to them, time, place and direction do not exist in Brahman, but are perceived with Brahman as their background; they are material upadhis, or artifi- cial impositions on Spirit. By the knowledge of their adhiṣṭhāna, or Brahman, these upadhis are placed into recession, just as when one recognizes a rope as a rope, he does not mistake it for a snake. Vai- kuntha is a place, and thus cannot be equal or superior to Brahman. To dispel such misgivings, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi devotes four anucche- das to explaining Vaikuntha's svarupa, or true nature. 
In the Eleventh Canto, Kṛṣṇa described three processes for the progress of human beings: 000 do aleg 
barb 15 nijanse 901 51sigmos bebbe ad ajot 
I have taught the three yogas-jñāna, karma and bhakti- for the ultimate welfare of humankind. Other than these three, there are no means to enlightenment. (SB 11.20.6)* 
He then proceeded to instruct Uddhava in these three yogas. In this anuccheda, Jiva Gosvāmī cites the concluding verse of that teach- ing, SB 11.20.37. The word patha refers to the three above-mentioned paths. In reality, the Lord is attained only through bhakti, but jñāna and vairagya are sometimes helpful in the beginning. Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmi confirms this in Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu: 
Jñana and vairagya are somewhat helpful in the beginning to enter upon the path of devotion, but they should not be considered as distinct limbs of bhakti. (BRS 1.2.248)5 
yardeaussed,minst 
no Jñana and vairagya help one detach the mind from sense attrac- tion, and thus enable one to appreciate the significance of bhakti.

Even though cleaning a gun is certainly helpful to facilitate a sharp- shooter's discipline, it does not guarantee that one will hit the mark when using that weapon. In the same way, the practices of jñāna and vairagya, though beneficial, do not assure the attainment of bhakti. Cleaning a gun is a process external to marksmanship itself; so too are jñāna and vairagya external to establishment in, and cultivation of, bhakti. mva ending all will to sing ad dw 
Thus, when the Lord says, "Those who perpetually adhere to My paths," He specifically means bhakti. When they attain completion of the paths in bhakti, they attain Vaikuntha, realizing it to be the Supreme Brahman. 
In commenting on the principal verse of this section (SB 11.20.37), Śrīdhara Svāmī writes, "They attain My world, which is free from time and māyā, and they also know the Supreme Brahman." The con- junction ca (also) does not appear in the verse, but Śrīdhara Svāmi has suggested that there is ellipsis of the word in order to be able to interpret the verse in accordance with the Radical Nondualist view. The implication of this contrived interpretation is that devo- tees attain Kṛṣṇa's abode and also realize Brahman, which would indicate that Brahman is superior to the Lord's abode and is the ultimate destination.dated toolery.navia dos med 
bŚrila Jiva Gosvāmi quotes two verses from the Tenth Canto describing the direct witnessing of Vaikuntha bestowed upon the residents of Vraja. Śrīdhara Svāmi comments on the first verse, "Sva means Brahman, and loka means Vaikuntha." Here also he assumes the conjunction ca, and instead of saying "His planet" (svam lokam), he comments that the Lord showed them His planet and Brahman as well. 
Śrila Jiva Gosvāmi objects to the artificial addition of ca in both cases as it yields a distorted meaning. In Tattva Sandarbha, Anu- ccheda 27, he says that although Sridhara Svāmī is a great Vaisnava, his commentary on Srimad Bhagavatam is mixed with the Radi- cal Nondualist interpretation, or Advaitavada. He has done this 
7 
⚫ kṣemaṁ kāla-māyādi-rahitam mama lokam vindanti yat paramam brahma tac ca 
viduḥ. 
svam brahma-svarupaṁ lokaṁ vaikuṇṭhākhyam ca 
655 
Śri Bhagavat Sandarbha 
deliberately to attract the non-theistic Vedäntists to study and reflect upon devotional Vedanta or devotional nondualism. As a result, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi resolved that whenever Śrīdhara Svāmi's explanation is in accordance with the pure Vaisnava conclusions, he would follow it. In other cases, he would explain Śrīdhara Svāmi's comment in line with pure Vaisnava principles. This is one instance where he prefers to differ with Śrīdhara Svāmi's comment, under- standing his real intention. 
cil Thus, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi says, tair eva ca tamasaḥ prakṛteḥ param iti vaikunthasyāpi višeṣaṇatvena vyakhyātam. Although Śrīdhara Svāmi has interpreted the verses to conform to the non-theistic view of the Absolute, he has identified the words tamasaḥ param, which means "beyond material nature," as an adjectival phrase modifying Vaikuntha. Jiva Gosvāmī mentions this fact to indicate that Śrīdhara Svāmi understood the transcendental nature of Vaikuntha. 
There is no need to explain Śrīdhara Svāmi's method, because the meaning of the original verses is clear. These verses especially describe the residents of Vraja, who have absolutely no interest in seeing Brahman. The Vraja-vāsīs desired to see the destination that awaited them. Thus, it would be entirely out of context for them to be given a vision of Brahman. Rather, the meaning is that Vaikuntha is the transcendental Absolute Reality, Brahman, and not a material planet. Therefore, Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī says that svam lokam (their own world) means Goloka, which is beyond ignorance. Satya means "eternally manifest;" jñāna means "conscious;" ananta means "unlimited;" sanatana means "eternal;" and jyoti means "self- effulgent." All this implies that Vaikuntha is sat-cit-ananda in nature. The great sages who are free from the gunas of nature can see this planet. This is confirmed in the Ṛk mantra: "The great sages always see the supreme abode of Śrī Visņu" (RV 1.22.20) 
Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi will continue to explain the transcendental nature of Vaikuntha in the following anuccheda.

The term a-tat (lit., "all that is not That," or "everything that is not the Absolute Truth") means other than the inherently exist- ing conscious being. They desire to cast off the a-tat, or the "non- real," by the process of negation, i.e., the principle of "not this, not this" (neti neti). They abandon false notions about the self's true identity (dauratmya), namely, the view that the self and the Lord are absolutely without distinction. They embrace the lotus feet of the Deserving One (arha), namely, Bhagavan, within their hearts (hṛdā) at every moment (pade pade). The term "single- minded heartfelt devotion" (ananya-sauhṛda) means that such devotees are filled with exclusive affection for Him alone, and not for anyone else. Such sages regard (amananti), i.e., they know, the abode of Śrī Viṣṇu, or in other words, Vaikuntha, to be the very form of Brahman. This is the import of the verse. 
अनेन प्रेमलक्षणसाधनलिङ्गेन निराकाररूपमर्थान्तरं निरस्तम् । 
Since this abode is attained through spiritual practices rooted in love of God (prema), any other interpretation of this verse amounting to the utter denial of form must be rejected.

Although the writer of the Mukta-phala commentary is commit- ted to the formless conception of the Absolute, Fate has inspired him to explain this verse as follows, "[Śrī Suka explains:] "They regard the abode of Sri Visņu as the Supreme Station.' The planets, such as that of Śrī Brahma, are under the control of Śrī Visņu, just as a provincial king is under the command of an emperor. There- fore, the adjective 'supreme' (para) has been used to qualify Śrī Visņu's abode. This means that this Supreme Station is presided over only by Śri Visņu."

Commentary 
of 
ŚRILA JIVA GOSVĀMI CONTINUES to explain the transcendental nature of Vaikuntha. This time he cites two verses that Sukadeva Gosvāmī spoke to Parīkṣit Mahārāja regarding krama-mukti (grad- ual liberation) and sadyo-mukti (immediate liberation). In the midst of his description, Sukadeva explains how to meditate on the Lord within the heart and how by gradual practice the meditator becomes free from disturbances caused by the senses and mind. Thereafter, he goes on to attain the transcendental platform. 
These two verses describe the state of transcendence called param padam, or the supreme abode of the Lord, which is free from the influence of time. The material world is controlled by the devas who are under the influence of time, yet time cannot influence the transcendental abode of the Lord. The gunas of nature, which are the cause behind material creation, also have no control over Vaikuntha. An alternate meaning is that time has no control over Vaikuntha, which is free from the gunas of nature and their source, pradhana. 
Only those who desire to give up association with inert matter (atad-utsisṛkṣava), who understand that the Lord both includes and transcends everything, and who have loving feelings exclusively for the Lord and His devotees, can understand Vaikuntha. The word dauratmya, which generally carries the meaning of "depravity," or "moral corruption," is used here more precisely in the sense of 
sa bhagavaḥ kasmin pratisthita iti sve mahimni

ascribing to the pure self (atma) a spurious identity. This can mani- fest in two ways - taking the pure self to be the body-mind complex, and thus committing attention to the enjoyment of matter; or taking the pure, yet infinitesimal, self to be the Infinite Reality, and thus denying the whole-part existentiality in which we inherently abide. 
The first type of “moral corruption" reduces the pure conscious self to inert matter, whereas the second type inflates the pure self to the Totality. The pure self is in fact an infinitesimal conscious part of the One supreme conscious Existent. As such, the pure self is inherently and inviolably one in identity with, yet distinct from, the conscious Whole that encompasses it. Only when a person is free from the moral corruption of ascribing to the self either of these false identities can he enter the transcendental abode of the Lord. This freedom cannot be material as only transcendental consciousness manifests the true nature of the self. 
Therefore, Vaikuntha cannot be a material destination. It is also not utterly devoid of form, which is to say that it is inclusive of transcendental form. 
As the verse states, devotees embrace the Lord's feet within their hearts at every moment. Thus, the words param padam, the supreme station, cannot refer to the formless brahmajyoti, in which there is no possibility of meditating on the Lord's feet. The word "feet" is indicative of the whole body. To do 
Śrī Hemādri, a staunch proponent of non-theistic Vedanta, who flourished around the twelfth century, wrote the Kaivalya-dipikā commentary on Mukta-phala of Śri Vopadeva. By the will of the Lord, his comment on the first verse of this work confirms the con- clusions of theistic Vedanta, or theistic nonduality. In these two verses, Vopadeva explains the formless feature of Visņu. According to him, Visnu has two features - formless and endowed with form (sa dvedha nirākāraḥ sākāraś ca). Prior to this, Vopadeva explained the formless feature of Viṣṇu. In the relevant portion of his com- mentary, Hemādri says that even the topmost planet in this material world is under Śrī Visnu's control, but His supreme abode, Vaikun- tha, is not controlled by anyone else. This is because Vaikuntha is a manifestation of Viṣṇu's own internal energy.

ŚRĪ NĀRADA CLEARLY STATES the meaning of the Śruti statement, "Who can know where He exists?" to King Pracinabarhi:

71 Vaikuntha Is Not Known to Ritualistic Performers 
Commentary 
Brow andia du 
At the end of THE PREVIOUS SECTION, Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī cited KU 1.2.25 to show that Bhagavan is situated in His transcendental abode and that ritualistic performers, who consider heaven as the ultimate goal, do not comprehend Vaikuntha. The complete mantra is as follows: 
Indeed, who knows where resides the One for whom brāhmaṇas and kṣatriyas are the rice and death the condiment? (KU 1.2.25)3 
In the mantra previous to this, it was said that one who has unwholesome conduct, uncontrolled senses and a disturbed mind cannot attain the Lord. This verse says that such a person cannot even understand His abode of the Lord. The reference to brāhmaṇas and kṣatriyas indicates all members of the God-centered society that is organized on the principles of varṇāśrama-dharma. Even they can- not know the Lord's abode if they do not give up addiction to fruitive action. In Section 61 it was explained that such people can reach no further than Satyaloka. But Vaikuntha is attained by bhakti. 
In this section, Śrī Jiva elucidates the meaning of the mantra by referring to a statement made by Narada Muni to King Pracinabarhi, who was expert in Karma-kanda, the ritualistic portion of the Vedas that aims primarily at heaven. He was fortunate to obtain the asso- ciation of Narada Muni, who told him that one cannot achieve the ultimate goal simply by fruitive action. 
On the king's request, Narada instructed him in transcendental knowledge by reciting the allegory of King Purañjana, wherein he explained that the Lord and His abode cannot be understood by those who are addicted to fruitive action. 
3 
This statement implies that both Vaikuntha and Bhagavan are sat, cit and ananda by their very nature. As material action can yield only material results, it is not possible to reach Vaikuntha by material 
action.

Pas Śri Bhagavat Sandarbha a 
Dhumra-dhiyaḥ refers to those whose intelligence is smoky, or in other words, impure. This implies that their intelligence has been affected unfavorably by the smoke produced from their fire sacrifices. Such ritualistic performers are attracted by Vedic state- ments like, "We will drink soma juice by performing sacrifice and become immortal" (apām somam amamṛtābhūma, Atharva-sikhā Upanisad 3.2). Or, "The piety of those who observe the vow of căturmasya is imperishable" (akṣayyam ha vai caturmasya-yājinaḥ sukṛtam, RV 8.48.3). 101 ano o brazed swore 
In reality, such statements must be understood as having sec- ondary meanings because nothing is imperishable in the material world. These statements are meant to attract people to engage in religious acts in order that they may perform some austerity and charity. Those who are less discerning, however, become attracted to such flowery pronouncements and consider them as the be-all and end-all of the Vedas. In Bhagavad Gitā also, Śrī Kṛṣṇa disparages the attitude of such people, known as Vedavādīs: 
Being filled with desire and allured by the goal of heaven, the igno- rant who are attached to the Vedic doctrine propound the flowery yd words of the Vedas, claiming that the Vedas are concerned with noth- ing other than elaborate rituals that bestow propitious birth, plea- surable fruits of action, and that lead to sense enjoyment and opu- lence. (GĪTĀ 2.42-43)* 
Śrī Kṛṣṇa also denies that there is any eternal benefit to such 
selfish acts:

After extensively enjoying the heavenly realm, when their merit is Web exhausted, they enter the world of mortality. Thus, those who are

committed to the religion of the three Vedas, seeking sense enjoy- ment alone, attain only such repeated coming and going. (GĪTĀ 9.21)5

71 Vaikuntha Is Not Known to Ritualistic Performers 
The real purpose of the Vedas is to know Kṛṣṇa-vedaiś ca sar- vair aham eva vedyaḥ (GITA 15.15). Those attached to the ritualistic portion of the Veda (Karma-kāṇḍa) sometimes receive the mercy of a true devotee and come to understand the real purpose of the revealed scripture. This happened in the case of King Prācinabarhi, who was blessed with the association of Narada. In general, how- ever, fruitive workers have no information about the transcenden- tal Lord and His abode. This is because they remain engrossed in the ritualistic action prescribed in the Vedas. 
In the following section, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi continues to give scriptural evidence concerning the transcendental nature of the Vaikuntha world.

THE SAME POINT' is made in the prose text, wherein the gods pray to Śrī Hari: 
'ॐ नमस्तेऽस्तु भगवन्” (भा० ६।९।३३) इत्यादिगद्ये “परमहंसपरिव्राजकैः परमेणात्म- योगसमाधिना परिभावितपरिस्फुटपारमहंस्यधर्मेणोद्धाटिततमः कपाटद्वारे चित्तेऽपावृत आत्मलोके स्वयमुपलब्धनिजसुखानुभवो भवान्” । 
O Bhagavan! I bow down to You. You taste the bliss derived from Your own Self in Your own abode (atma-loke), which is discovered within the heart by the topmost wandering ascetics, when con- sciousness is uncovered after the gates of darkness (tamas) have been unlocked, through practice of the dharma of ultimate com- pletion (päramahamsya-dharma), which is revealed and realized in the highest state of yogic trance in the Self.

That abode is blissful, eternal, peaceful, always auspicious, wor- shipable by devas like Brahma and meditated upon by yogis. It is devoid of all defects. The yogis who enter there, never come back. This is stated in the Ṛg Veda mantras:" "The devotees always see that supreme abode of Śrī Visnu, which extends all around like sunlight in the sky. The brahmanas, who always attentively glorify the Lord, render that abode even more brilliant. This is the supreme abode of Visnu"" (NTU 5.10)8

The supreme abode referred to in this statement of Nrsimha- tapani Upaniṣad should not be interpreted as indeterminate Brah- man, because this possibility is denied by phrases like, "It is wor- shipable by gods like Brahmā,” and, "yogis who enter there.” Fur- thermore, the same statement from RV 1.22.20 has been kept in mind in the Visnu Purana description of Sri Visņu's abode:

These verses indicate that [even though he had attained the Lord and had been awarded residence in Vaikuntha] Dhruva Mahārāja considered himself to be still incomplete.

Although this abode is in the material world, it is free from mate- rial attributes. This is in accordance with the principle stated in Brahma-sutra, "The living liberated dwell not in the ever- changing [i.e., they abide only in the changeless], because such an existence has been declared as true by the Śrutis" (vs 4.4.19).20

Therefore, during the annihilation cycle, only the external cov- ering of this cosmically-situated Vaikuntha becomes dissolved and the internal portion remains unmanifest. Because he failed to distinguish between surface appearance and underlying essence, Hiranyakasipu said: "By the influence of time, except for Satyaloka, all other planets, such as Visnuloka, are destroyed at the end of Brahma's day. What purpose do I have to achieve from them?"21

So when this cosmically-situated Vaikuntha has been shown to be transcendental, it is certainly the case that the original Mahāvaikuntha is transcendental to the material world. After describing the opulence of the material world, Lord Śiva, while citing various statements from the Śruti, narrated the glories of Vaikuntha in a similar way:

It is pure, golden, the place of liberation, In and includes within itself the bliss of Brahman realization. It has no beginning or end, and nothing is equal or superior to it. It is auspicious, wonderfuly brilliant, eternal and an ocean of bliss. This place, the reservoir of all such qualities, is called the supreme abode of Śrī Visnu.23

It is not possible for me, Śrī Brahma or the hosts of sages to describe the abode of Śri Hari. In that abode, Lord Acyuta is the ultimate controller, yet I cannot say whether or not even He knows the full extent of its glory. That abode is imperishable and confidentially described in the Vedas. The gods, who preside over cosmic functions, take shelter of it.

In the center of the supreme abode of Śrī Visnu is a spring called Śubha. There are many long-horned cows accompanied by their calves sitting comfortably around it. That is the supreme abode of the glorious Śri Visņu. That supreme abode appears splendrous with the cows, and by the mantras called śubha. It is pure, eternal, beyond ignorance, effulgent and brilliant, like the sun. 27

The supreme abode of Śrī Visnu is called Mokṣa. Those who cut asunder their bondage to the material world will attain that bliss- ful place. Having attained it, one never returns; therefore, this place is called Mokṣa, or liberation. That eternal, transcenden- tal, undecaying supreme sky is called moksa, param padam, linga, amrta, visnu-mandira, aksara, parama-dhāma, vaikuntha, śās- vatar param, nitya, parama-vyomā, sarvotkrsta and sanātana 30

In these verses, words like pada and dhama have been used in their primary sense to indicate "abode," and not in the uncon- ventional sense of the Lord's svarupa, i.e., His "form" or "nature." Nevertheless, if someone somehow decides to pursue this uncon- ventional interpretation, then it should be refuted, as elsewhere in the same text there is direct use of the word sthāna ("place" or “location”), such as in “they attain My place called param brahma."36 Someone may put forth the weak argument that one should read the phrase, "is known as param brahma," [in the first verse of the passage] cited earlier from Itihasa-samuccaya," as a separate sentence, by inserting the word "and." This interpre- tation, however, separates the substantive pada from the imme- diately preceding adjectives that qualify it. Nonetheless, if this explanation is entertained, it would then be necessary to borrow the word loka (world), used in these other quotes. Who would not comprehend that just as the words bhagavan, hari and vişnu in a sentence like, “ This is Bhagavān, Visņu, Hari, ” speak of only one person, the words pada, dhāma, sthāna and loka are being used synonymously? Their usage together in one place makes other interpretation impossible.idno da bod

In conclusion, it may be said that the correct explanation of the prose text SB 6.9.33 has been given. 
Commentary 
IN SECTION 71, Śrī Jīva Gosvāmi explained that the param padam, which the Radical Nondualists misinterpret as unqualified Brahman, actually refers to Vaikuntha. In the same section, he established that the Vedavādīs, who are bewildered by the flowery statements of the Vedas, mistakenly claim that heaven is the supreme desti- nation. Now he further substantiates his conclusion with numer- ous references from the Upanisads, Vedanta-sutra and the Purāņas. By citing these references, he also shows that atma-loka, brahma- loka, param padam, vaiṣṇava-pada, paramam dhama, mokṣa, tripada- vibhuti, hareḥ padam, mahā-vaikuntha, acyuta-sthāna, visņu-mandira and so on, are all synonyms for the abode of Bhagavan.ow seaf 
First, Śrī Jiva Prabhu refers to the prayers of the gods when they approached Śrī Visnu for protection from Vṛtrasura. The story goes that Indra, overcome by pride and opulence, once disrespected his guru, Bṛhaspati. Taking Indra's insult to be worse than death, Brhas- pati left Indra's kingdom. When the Daityas (or the "anti-gods") heard that the gods had lost the protection of their guru, they real- ized that they were weakened and susceptible. They immediately attacked and were gaining the upper hand over the gods. When Śrī Brahma witnessed the plight of the gods, he felt compassion and sug- gested to them that they accept the son of Tvaṣṭā, Viśvarupa, as their guru. Viśvarupa taught Indra the protective incantations known as nārāyaṇa-kavaca, and as a result he was able to gather his forces and drive the asuras back. 
681 
Śrī Bhagavat Sandarbha 
Later on, however, Viśvarupa secretly offered the Daityas obla- tions from a sacrifice. He did this because his mother, Racanã, was the daughter of a Daitya. Appalled by his treachery, Indra killed Viśvarupa. But this enraged Tvaṣṭā, who then created a powerful asura, named Vṛtrāsura, to kill Indra. Out of fear of this asura, the gods prayed to Śrī Visnu for protection. The prose passage (SB 6.9.33) quoted at the beginning of this section has been taken from those 
prayers. 
9d1 dr bisa od vam ti halos al The gods state that the Lord is realized by the paramahamsa- parivrājakas. There are four types of sannyasis - kuṭicaka, bahudaka, hamsa and nişkriya. The nişkriya-sannyasi is also called paramahamsa, the most complete of the four divisions. There are two types of paramahamsas-jñānī and bhāgavata. The paramahamsa mentioned in this text is a bhāgavata-paramahamsa, and paramahamsya-dharma (the dharma of ultimate completion) here refers to pure devotional service, the process that aims at the Complete, Śrī Bhagavan. 
The word atma-loka (Your own abode) means the abode of the Lord (ātmā), Vaikuntha. When the devotee's heart is purified by the culture of devotional service, he sees the Lord in Vaikuntha. Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī cites two Upanisadic mantras to confirm that ātma- loka means Vaikuntha. In the first, atma-loka is glossed as brahma- loka, and the second states that the Lord is situated in brahma-pura. These two terms cannot be taken to mean unqualified Brahman, because Brahman cannot be a location like a loka (world) or pura (city). Brahma-pura has the same meaning as brahma-loka. Because the second mantra says that the Lord is situated in brahma-pura, it implies that brahma-loka is a place. Since brahma-loka has been given as a synonym for atma-loka (cf. BAU 4.3.32), it naturally fol- lows that ātma-loka in this passage should be read as Vaikuntha, the abode of the Lord. 
He Śrila Jiva Gosvāmi also quotes verses from Pippalada-śākhā, Mahā-nārāyaṇa Upanisad, and Nrsimha-tapani Upanisad to show that Vaikuntha is the eternal transcendental abode of the Lord. These mantras cannot be applied to unqualified Brahman, because they contain phrases and verbal elements that would make such an inter- pretation impossible. For example, the statement "worshipable by 
682 
72 Dhruvaloka Is Also Transcendental Vaikuntha 
gods like Brahma" cannot refer to Brahman, since Brahman, being unqualified, indescribable and inconceivable, cannot be the object of worship through words, or of meditation through mental focussing and concentration. Furthermore, the statement "the yogis who enter there never come back" also cannot apply to Brahman, since Brah- man, being devoid of divisions, such as interior and exterior, cannot be exited or entered into. Brahman, therefore, cannot be intended in these mantras, because it does not have any manifest characteristics that would make these actions possible in regard to it. 
eixa for 
In the Nrsimha-tapani mantra, the words mantra-rājādhyāpaka mean "teacher of the Vedas." This is a reference to Śrī Visņu, or Kṛṣṇa, who originally gave the Vedas to Brahma-tene brahma hṛdā ya adikavaye (SB 1.1.1). Therefore, paramaṁ dhama refers to Vaikun- tha. Śrī Kṛṣṇa confirms the meaning of the first part of the mantra in Bhagavad Gitā: 
a 
Not illumined by the sun or moon, nor by fire, such is My supreme abode, reaching which one never returns to this material world. (GĪTĀ 15.6) 38 
gives vd abrogaser 
vd abrogan naved 
The meaning is that the Lord's abode is self-effulgent and does not depend upon sun or moon for illumination. 
To further confirm the meaning of this mantra, Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmi quotes a series of verses from VP 2.8.98-102, which were spoken by Śrī Parāśara to Maitreya Muni. Parāśara had explained the structure of the universe in the previous chapter and gave the measurements of the various planetary systems. These five verses describe Dhruva's planet. Śrīdhara Svāmi comments in his Atma-prakāśa commentary that the last of these verses explains the meaning of two Vedic mantras beginning with tad vişnoḥ, namely RV 1.22.20. Dhruva's planet is compared to the heart of the universal form,39 and thus it is the residence of Śrī Vişņu, because Śrī Kṛṣṇa 
38 na tad bhasayate suryo na śaśānko na pavakaḥ 
39 
yad gatva na nivartante tad dhāma paramam mama orisur sill to fee tad dhi vairajasya hṛdaya-nāḍī-sthanam atas tad antaryamino vişnoḥ sthānam iti śridharah.antation 
Śrīdhara Svāmi's comment 
683 
by Śrī Bhagavat Sandarbhavin 
says that Paramātmā resides in the heart of all beings (GĪTĀ 18.61). It is on the northern side, above the planets of the Seven Sages. Indeed, it is the Pole Star, which is also called the North Star. In Vedic astronomy, it is counted as the third planetary system from the earth. Devotees who are free from material contamination see this planet as effulgent as the sun. This implies that Dhruvaloka is transcendental, which is confirmed in Nrsimha-tapani Upanisad, where it is said that material objects, like the sun, moon or air, do not exist in Vaikuntha. But this does not mean there is no sun, moon or air in Vaikuntha. 
ho An objection may be raised. Verses SB 4.9.29 and SB 4.9.31, cited in this anuccheda, make it clear that Dhruva Mahārāja was not con- tent after Śrī Viṣṇu blessed him. He lamented that he had petitioned the Lord to grant him a finite boon (ayace yad antavat), rather than asking for liberation, which is the very thing that only the Lord Himself can grant (naicchan muktipate muktim). This would seem to imply that Dhruvaloka, the abode he attained, must be temporary and inferior to mukti. Otherwise, why would he lament? 
Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī responds by saying that these verses depict Dhruva's despondency for having desired material gain in the first place. His worship had been egotistically motivated, and it was only after he met the Lord that he came to realize his pettiness. Although the Lord blessed him with an eternal abode, Dhruva lamented, remembering his original intention. If this were not похода the case, Vidura's question would make no sense:pin tox 
ді 
My dear brahmana, the supreme abode of Śrī Hari is a most rare eir achievement and can be earned only by worshiping the Lord's lotus jav 90 feet, and not by those who have material desires. Dhruva reached/ Mathis abode in a single lifetime, and also knew its true value, yet he m was still unhappy, thinking himself to be as yet incomplete. Why was that? (SB 4.9.28)40 
Dhruva is described here as artha-vit, or one who knows the true goal of life. Furthermore, he had achieved it, so why should he

72 Dhruvaloka Is Also Transcendental Vaikuntha 
lament? Were Vaikuntha not the topmost abode, his lamentation would have been justified and there would have been no need for Vidura to inquire into it. The previously cited verses were given in answer to Vidura's question. 
Śrila Jiva Gosvāmi goes on to cite verses from Srimad Bhagavatam that clearly show that Dhruvaloka is the abode of Lord Visņu and beyond the material gunas, despite being situated within the mate- rial universe. How much more transcendental, then, is the original Vaikuntha that is beyond the material universe? od mrist dr ViJiva Gosvāmi confirms this by quoting vs 4.4.19. In his Govinda- bhāṣya, Śrīpāda Baladeva Vidyabhuṣaṇa comments that the word vikāra in the sutra means a material object that undergoes the six modifications. The Lord's abode is free from such and is therefore called vikārāvarti, i.e., the changeless existence. 
Isip Whenever it is mentioned that the Lord's abode within the mate- rial world is annihilated, like Dvārakā, it is to be understood that only the manifest external feature is destroyed. The Lord's abode is neither created nor destroyed, but becomes manifest and unmani- fest just like the Lord. This is clear from the statements of Śrī Suka describing the Lord's disappearance: 
O Mahārāja! Once abandoned by the Supreme Lord Śrī Hari, the entire city of Dvaraka was inundated by the ocean, with the single MS exception of the Lord's personal residence. Lord Madhusudana eter- Hnally resides there, the simple remembrance of which destroys all 
inauspiciousness and bestows the greatest benefit to all."no es 
baz ainams 812 
10 9006 
These two verses make it clear that the Lord's abode, even when manifested in the material world, is eternal. In his Krama-sandarbha commentary on SB 11.31.23, Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmi explains that the man- ifest pastimes of the Lord contain or employ certain elements that belong to the material creation. The creation of Dvaraka by Vis- vakarma, the engineer of the gods, and the bringing of the Sudharma

685 
Śri Bhagavat Sandarbhav 
assembly house from heaven illustrate this. It is only these material sectors that were destroyed by the ocean and not the eternal Dvārakā, which becomes unmanifest simultaneously. This is confirmed in Viṣṇu Purāṇa: 
The ocean submerged the empty Dvärakā, but it did not submergey the house of the Lord of the Yadus, Kṛṣṇa. (VP 5.38.9) 42 
The term "house of the Lord" refers to the complete planet, as it is the abode of the Lord. The material part of Dvaraka was empty, because all the Yadavas had gone to Pindaraka Kṣetra for a picnic and, under "divine inebriation," killed each other there. These Yadavas were actually gods who came to participate in His pas- times on His order and not His eternally liberated associates. On the destruction of their bodies, these gods returned to their celestial posts.3ftsb 
While going to perform austerities on Mandaracala Mountain, Hiranyakasipu claimed that Viṣṇuloka was temporary, and thus he had no interest in it. Because his self-identity was rooted in athe- ism, materialism and subject-object dualism, he could not under- stand Vaikuntha's transcendental nature. Again, he had reference only to the material part, which is nevertheless connected with the abode of the Lord. Devotees, however, are never unsettled by such unfounded statements. Materialism reduces Reality to sur- faces only, like the outer shell of a coconut, without any inkling of the fruit and juice lying within. Statements based in ignorance or incomplete knowledge cannot affect those who know Reality. 
Subsequent to citing Hiranyakaśipu, Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī refers to verses from Padma Purāṇa, Nārada-pañcarātra, Brahmanda Purāṇa, Itihasa-samuccaya and Skanda Purana, all of which describe the transcendental and blissful nature of Vaikuntha. These verses confirm the Vedic mantras quoted earlier (tad vişnoḥ paramam 
42 plävayāmāsa tām śünyaṁ dvārakam ca mahodadhiḥ yadu-śrestha-gṛham tv ekam naplavayata sagaraḥ 43 See SB 10.1.22. 
686 
72 Dhruvaloka Is Also Transcendental Vaikuntha 
padam).44 Therefore, it was confirmed from the Śruti, Smrti and nyāya-prasthānas that Vaikuntha is a transcendental abode, free from any material contamination. 
Sometimes Radical Nondualists try to interpret the words pada and dhama to mean Brahman. But such explanations are muddled because there are numerous places where the Lord refers to Vaikun- tha as mat-sthāna (My abode). Sthāna, loka and puri directly mean a place or world. There is no need to resort to a secondary meaning when the primary meaning is clear. 
When param brahma, which can in the appropriate context refer to Brahman, appears with any of the words loka, sthāna or pada, it is highly improper to divide the words into separate sentences. This is a defect called vakya-bheda. It is comparable to separating the word "lord" from the word hari in the statement, "This is Śrī Hari." 
Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī says that such people are put to shame by these puranic verses and recommends they be driven back with the weapon-like verses that establish Vaikuntha as a transcendental abode, and one that cannot be attained by karma, yoga or jñāna. Con- sidering the Lord's body or His abode as material is a gross misinter- pretation of the Vedas and Vedic literature. Such explanations lead a person away from their real meaning and thus deny them the sibility of higher completion in Bhagavan, who by His very nature includes and transcends indeterminate Brahman. A Vaiṣṇava can never tolerate this. Śrī Jīva Prabhu thus uses harsh words against such misinterpreters. 
pos- 
In this way, Śrila Jiva Gosvāmi has shown the nine characteris- tics of Vaikuntha in the last twelve anucchedas. These attributes are again summarized below. 
1. It cannot be attained as an effect of result-oriented action of any 
kind. 
82. It is beyond the visible material world. 
3. No one falls from Vaikuntha.

THIS CONCLUDES THE DESCRIPTION of the essential features of Śrī Vaikuntha. It should also be noted that Vaikuntha has many dis- tinct manifestations, in the same way that the Lord sometimes manifests fully and sometimes partially (amsa). These include the abodes of Viṣṇu's different forms, like Matsyadeva, which are described in the Uttara-khanda of Padma Purana. Maitreya hints at this: 
EXE 
एवं हिरण्याक्षमसह्यविक्रमं स सादयित्वा हरिरादिसूकरः ।

Having thus killed the oppressively powerful Hiranyākṣa, Śrī Hari, the primal boar, returned to His own abode, where cele- brations continue without interruption. All the while, He was praised by Śri Brahma and the other gods. (SB 3.19.31)1 
सादयित्वा हत्वा । पवित्रारोपप्रसङ्गे चैवमाह बोधायनः 
Sādayitva means "having killed." In the section describing the Pavitraropana festival, Śrī Bodhāyana similarly said:

A deep ocean of water surrounds the universal egg (brahmaṇḍa). Beyond this water, above and on all sides, there is a spherical effulgence which holds the water. This fire is like a hot ball of iron, making a circular orbit, and is surrounded by dense air that suspends it. The dense air is held by the sky. The sky is surrounded by the tan-matras, which in turn are covered by the mahat. The mahat is upheld and pervaded by the unmanifest adia and limitless pradhana from all sides. This pradhana is bound- less, unmanifest, without beginning or end and is tamas, or dark.

Vaikuntha Self-Manifests like the Lord's Body 
७४ । एवं च यथा श्रीभगवद्वपुराविर्भवति लोके तथैव क्वचित् कस्यचित् तत्पदस्याविर्भावः श्रूयते (भा० ८।५।४-५ ) - 
THEREFORE, just as the Lord's body self-manifests in this [mate- rial] world, similarly scriptures describe that at different times one of the various abodes of the Lord self-manifests somewhere in the world. As Śrī Sūta states: 
1 
पत्नी विकुण्ठा शुभ्रस्य वैकुण्ठैः सुरसत्तमैः ।

Vikuntha was the wife of the sage Subhra. From them, the Lord Himself appeared as Vaikuntha, a partial manifestation, along with gods who were also known as Vaikunthas. Being requested by the goddess Ramā (Lakṣmi), in order to please her, the Lord manifested a planet named Vaikuntha, to which all the universes bow down. (SB 8.5.4-5)1 
यथा भगवत आविर्भावमात्रं जन्मेति भण्यते तथैव वैकुण्ठस्यापि कल्पनमाविर्भावनमेव न तु प्राकृतवत् कृत्रिमत्वम् । उभयत्रापि नित्यत्वादित्यभिप्रायेण तत्साम्येनाह – जज्ञ इति ।

Just as the self-manifestation of the Lord is called "birth," simi- larly the "creation" of Vaikuntha signifies its self-manifestation only, and not that it is artificially produced like a material object. This is because both Bhagavan and His abode are eternal. Suka- deva spoke this verse with the intention of showing that Bhaga- vän and His abode are the same. This Vaikuntha refers only to that of the son of Vikuntha, for it is well known from the Sec- ond Canto (SB 2.9.9-16) that the original Vaikuntha was seen by Śrī Brahmā before he started the work of creation. 
“स तन्निकेतं परिमृश्य शून्यमपश्यमानः कुपितो ननाद" ( भा०८।१९।११) इत्युक्तम् । तत्स्थानं तु स्वर्गादिगतमेव ज्ञेयम् ॥ श्रीशुकः ॥

It should also be known that the Vaikuntha referred to in Śrī Vamana's statement, "Hiranyakasipu searched for the Lord throughout His abode and, not finding Him, roared out of anger" (SB 8.19.11), is in the Svarga region. 
Commentary 
159750 100 A 
THE LORD'S BODY IS ETERNAL but self-manifests in the material world at certain times. Similarly, Vaikuntha planets also self- manifest at various times. In the Raivata-manvantara, the reign of the fifth Manu, Śrī Vaikuntha appeared from the sage Subhra and Śrīmati Vikuṇṭhā. His associates, who are also known as Vaikuntha, appeared along with Him. The Lord manifested His planet, Vaikun- tha, at the request of His consort, Lakṣmi Devi. This Vaikuntha is above Satyaloka and is different from the Mahāvaikuntha that Śrī Brahmã described in Anuccheda 13. 
yd na 
Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī confirms this in LBH 1.91, while describing Lord Vaikuntha, the Manvantarāvatāra. He quotes the two verses cited in this anuccheda and then writes: 
693 
Śrī Bhagavat Sandarbha 
Mahāvaikuntha is all-pervading and imperishable in nature. Its self-e manifestation above Satyaloka is called kalpana (creation)?) 
Here Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmi clarifies the meaning of the word kalpita (used in SB 8.5.5). The common meaning of kalpita is "imag- ined," or "created," but because Vaikuntha is neither, the meaning must be taken as "manifested." If Vaikuntha had either of these characteristics, it would be like any other planet. "Manifested" is not an unreasonable or far-fetched meaning of kalpita or kalpana, because kalpita comes from the verbal root √kṛpu sämarthye, which means "to be capable." By His own power the Lord made Vaikuntha manifest above Satyaloka. In the same way that the Lord's appear- ance is called "birth" (janma), the appearance of His abode is called kalpana. 
SIFP 
The Lord is not visible to the asuras. When He appears in the material world, ungodly persons, or in other words those con- tracted away from Spirit, cannot realize His nature because Bha- gavan covers Himself by maya. As stated in Bhagavad Gitä: V 
giban ion bus shods aiH 
odguon I am not revealed to all, for I remain concealed by yoga-maya. This bewildered world does not recognize Me as the unborn and inexhaustible. (GĪTĀ 7.25)3 
Similarly, Bhagavan's abode remains invisible to the asuras even if they consider it to be ordinary. This is evident from the state- ment of Hiranyakasipu quoted earlier, "Vaikuntha is also destroyed at the time of dissolution" (kim anyaiḥ kala-nirdhūtaiḥ kalpänte vaiṣṇavādibhiḥ, SB 7.3.11). This means that he was unable to real- ize the real Vaikuntha. The holy abodes of the Lord, like Vṛndāvana, which exist within the material world, remain concealed by a layer of material energy. The non-devotees cannot penetrate this layer and see the real abode. the 
Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi points out the difference between the Mahā- vaikuntha seen by Śrī Brahma and the one manifested by Śrī

Vaikuntha, by referring to the history of Hiranyakasipu. When Śrī Varaha killed Hiranyakṣa, his brother Hiranyakasipu was enraged and sought to take revenge on Śrī Viṣṇu. He went to Vaikuntha to look for Him, but when he could not find Him, he became even more angry. Since Hiranyakasipu did not go beyond the coverings of the universe, the place he visited was the Vaikuntha manifest in the material world. Therefore, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī says that this Vaikuntha is within the upper planetary system, Svarga. Vada 
The principal verse in this section is spoken by Lord Vamanadeva when He went to beg three steps of land from Bali Mahārāja. It implies that one cannot attain the Lord simply by physical endeavor. Although Hiranyakasipu was able to reach Vaikuntha, he could not see the Lord. Thus, his reaching Vaikuntha was as good as not reach- ing. Similarly, there are many unfortunate people who come to Vṛndāvana but do not appreciate that it is the land of Śrī Kṛṣṇa's pas- times. Such people derive no benefit from residing in the dhama, rather they become more and more fallen. Some of these unfor- tunate people think that they will somehow obtain liberation by meeting death in Vṛndāvana. They want to extract the benefit of the dhama without showing any appreciation for it. This is their misfortune. 
In this section, Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī has shown that Vaikuntha is completely transcendental and belongs to the internal nature, or svarupa, of the Lord. It can manifest just like the Lord. Next he will show that the Lord's associates are also part of His internal nature.

Bhagavan's Associates Are Transcendental like Him 
७५ । तदेवं श्रीवैकुण्ठस्य स्वरूपभूतत्वे सिद्धे तदङ्गभूतानां श्रीपार्षदानां तादृशत्वं सुतरां सिद्धमेव । युक्तं चैव तत्सेवकानाम् “नादेवो देवमर्चयेत्” इति तत्सदृशताभावनामन्तरेणो- द्देशेनापि तत्सेवायामनधिकारात् साक्षात् तु साक्षादेव तत्सदृशत्वमिति । तदेवं नित्यपार्ष- दानां कैमुत्यमेवापतितम् ।

IT HAS THUS BEEN ESTABLISHED that Śrī Vaikuntha is part of the Lord's essential nature (svarupa). It naturally follows that the associates of the Lord, who are His inherent parts, should also be the same. This is certainly befitting for His servants, for one who lacks the consciousness of being of the same nature as the Lord is not fit even to worship the Deity, according to the princi- ple, "One who is not of the nature of the Divine should not wor- ship the Divine" (nādevo devam arcayet). Certainly, then, direct worship of the Lord Himself requires the devotee to be directly of the same nature as the Lord. It is thus logical to conclude that the nature of the Lord's eternal associates cannot possibly be other than identical to the divine nature of the Lord.

Commentary 
resig Jud 
AFTER ESTABLISHING that Vaikuntha is part of the Lord's essential nature, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī goes on to say that His associates are also svarupa-bhūta, or part of the Lord's essential nature. It was already established that Vaikuntha cannot be approached by mate- rial means - it can be attained only by pure devotional service. It has also been shown that Vaikuntha is completely free from the material gunas. This naturally implies that everything that exists in Vaikuntha is transcendental, including the associates of the Lord. 
The Lord has two types of associates - the eternally liberated (nitya-siddhas), and those who became liberated from cyclic exis- tence by performing devotional service (sadhana-siddhas). Both are transcendental to the material guņas. Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi says that those devotees in the material world who practice devotional ser- vice and thus worship the Lord in the form of the Deity, cannot do so properly unless they purify their consciousness. The body is made of material elements and the Lord is transcendental. Just as it would be inappropriate to serve food to a respected guest with soiled hands, the material body in and of itself, being a bundle of impurities, is an unfit instrument with which to render service to the transcen- dental Lord. Unless the body is transformed through consciousness, service by the body alone gives no pleasure to the Lord and hence cannot be counted as service. dd Zollefeld broad daw noi 
The general principle is nadevo devam arcayet - "One who is not of the Divine should not worship the Divine," and, devam bhūtvā yajeta devam - "Worship the Divine after becoming divine." Since all living beings in the material world have material bodies, it is necessary to first acquire divine qualities before performing deity service. In the upasana-śästra, or the scriptural division deal- ing with worship of the Lord, this process is called bhūta-suddhi, 
697 
milled lave Śrī Bhagavat Sandarbha 
transformation of the material elements of the body through con- sciousness. The word upa-asana literally means "having a seat near to the Lord," but this is not to be taken merely in a physical sense. To worship (upāsana) one has to be not only in physical proximity, but present in consciousness. 
"Become divine in order to worship the Divine," does not mean that one should meditate upon oneself as the Deity. Such medi- tation is called ahangrahopasana and should be shunned by those who aspire to walk the path of devotion. Nor should one meditate upon oneself directly as being one of the eternal associates of the Lord, such as Nanda Mahārāja or Yaśodā Rāņi. This is also consid- ered ahangrahopasană. In his commentary on BRS 1.2.306, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī has forbidden such meditation. 
The Tantras explain various types of bhūta-suddhi for various types of worshipers. Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī explains that pure devo- tees should meditate upon themselves as having a suitable form for the service of the Lord (Bhakti Sandarbha, Anuccheda 285). This is in accordance with the famous verse by Śrī Caitanya Mahaprabhu: 
I am not a brāhmaṇa, nor am I a kṣatriya; I am not a vaiśya, nor śūdra. I am not a brahmacārī, nor a householder, a retired man or ba d 
a renunciate monk. But since Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the lover of the gopis and an overflowing ocean of nectar, is the sole source of supreme and immortal joy, I am simply a servant to the servant of the servant of His lotus feet. (Padyavali 74)2 
The purport is that to serve the Lord one has to see beyond all ephemeral designations related to the material body, made of the pañca-bhūtas, and situate oneself in one's eternal constitutional rela- tion with the Lord. This is called bhūta-śuddhi, or becoming free from bodily designations. This is the true meaning of "becoming divine." Thinking oneself as a brahmana or a sannyasi is material because these are material designations.

75 Bhagavan's Associates Are Transcendental like Him 
If such awareness is the necessary qualification to worship the deity form of the Lord, it naturally follows that direct service to Him requires that one be situated in one's spiritual constitutional posi- tion. This proves unequivocally that the eternal associates of the Lord are transcendental. They render transcendental service to the transcendental Lord with their transcendental minds and senses. L. The verse referred to was spoken by Yudhisthira Mahārāja to Narada Muni, regarding the Lord's associates, Jaya and Vijaya. King Yudhisthira was surprised to hear that the Lord's gatekeepers could be cursed by the Kumāras. His question naturally proves that Jaya and Vijaya did not have material bodies, because such a possibility would violate the inherent nature of the transcendental abode. Their bodies were made of spirit. Some try to postulate from this that they could have been pure living entities belonging to taṭastha-sakti, or the intermediary potency, and not part of the antaranga-sakti, or the Lord's own internal potency. This doubt will be cleared up in the following anuccheda.

Commentary 
IN THE PREVIOUS SECTION, Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmi explained that the associates of the Lord are transcendental like Him. Now he explains that some of the Lord's intimate associates have the same bodily fea- tures as the Lord, which is the liberated condition known as sārūpya- mukti. This increases the beauty of the Lord, for when people having

70076 The Lord's Associates Are like the Lord 
similar bodily features walk together, it appears elegant. The verse says they are atma-tulya, i.e., similar or equal to the Lord. 
Similarity is defined as the condition of having many of the qual- ities of another entity or object, yet still being different from it? The associates of the Lord are not equal to Him in every sense, as no one can be equal to or greater than the Lord. The verse says that the Lord's associates look like Him, but they lack the Śrīvatsa mark on their chest and the Kaustubha gem around their neck. These two distinct features of the Lord are not to be found on anyone else. The mark of Śrīvatsa is a tuft of golden hair, having a clockwise turn, on the left side of the Lord's chest? This mark represents the con- sort of the Lord, Śrī Lakṣmi Devi. The Kaustubha gem represents the living beings (cf. SB 3.28.28). Only the Lord holds both Lakṣmi Devi (antaranga-sakti) and the living beings (taṭastha-sakti) within Himself; therefore, these two insignia are found only on Him. 
According to Śrī Vamśīdhara, a commentator on Śrīmad Bhā- gavatam, the names of the Lord's sixteen associates are as follows: Nanda, Sunanda, Prabala, Udbala, Jaya, Vijaya, Visvaksena, Garuda, Śrutadeva, Jayanta, Kumuda, Kumudākṣa, Niśatha, Satvata, Pus- padanta and Daruka. However, different lists of names are found in different scriptures. That given in Padma Purana was quoted by Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi in Anuccheda 10. Śrimad Bhagavatam also gives some of their names in the following verse: 
One should worship the Lord's associates Nanda and Sunanda, Garuda, Pracanda and Canda, Mahabala and Bala, Kumuda and Kumudekṣaṇa. (SB 11.27.28)4 
This verse describes these associates of the Lord as worshipable along with the Lord. It also implies that they are of the same nature as the Lord. In Śrīmad Bhagavatam the Lord made this point Himself when He said of His personal associate Uddhava: 
2 tad-bhinnatve sati tadvad bhuyo dharmavattvam 
vakṣasi śukla-varna-dakṣiṇāvarta-lomāvalī

broad Śri Bhagavat Sandarbha 
Since he is master of his senses and never affected by material wilay nature or its gunas, Śrī Uddhava is in no measure less than I. Let hims therefore remain in the world to spread transcendental knowledge about Me. (SB 3.4.31)5 
Similar descriptions can be found of the Lord's other associates in Vraja as well as in Dvārakā. 
ΠΟ 
In the next anuccheda, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī says that because the Lord's associates are like Him, their association is the supreme goal to be achieved.

THEREFORE, the associates of the Lord are not influenced by time.

Prahlada Mahārāja prayed for this to Lord Nrsimha:

Commentary 
Śri Bhagavat Sandarbha 
AFTER EXPLAINING that the associates of the Lord are transcenden- tal, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi makes this same point in a different way. The devotees of the Lord do not desire anything material, nor even liberation: 
3 
One who has surrendered himself to Me does not desire anything A other than Me, not the position of Śrī Brahma or the kingdom of Indra, mastery over the Earth, or sovereignty over the netherworlds. He seeks not the paranormal powers of yoga, nor even liberation from birth and death. (SB 11.14.14)2 
But these devotees most certainly desire the company of the Lord's associates. This means that the Lord's associates are sup- remely transcendental; otherwise, why would such exclusive devotees have any desire to associate with them? 
Ti Such a desire was cherished by bhakta Prahlada. One should not think that Prahlada Mahārāja desired to be relieved from material suffering. His only desire was to serve the Lord, but because he faced such severe obstacles to the performance of devotion in the association of ungodly people, he longed to be in the company of true devotees. The words nija-bhṛtya-pārśva are important. Bhṛtya means servant. Prahlada desired to live in the company of the Lord's servants, which implies that he wished to be their servant. Other- wise, he would have prayed to be relieved from material misery. He had no material desire, however, as became apparent when the Lord tried to entice him with a boon apart from pure bhakti:ownl 
mol sdi ni wo? yd boyortasb 1 di Ad8

O my Lord, I am Your desireless devotee and You are my eternal mas- ter. Neither of us have any expectation of each other, unlike the relationship between a king and his servant. If You wish to give me a boon, O Lord, best of those who offer blessings, then I ask

77 A Devotee's Highest Aspiration: To Be in the Company of the Lord's Associates 
only for this from You: that no desires may ever arise in my heart. (SB 7.10.6-7)3 
Prahlada had no material desires and prayed not to have any in the future. Yet he yearned for the association of the Lord's asso- ciates. This indirectly shows that the Lord's associates are not mate- rial, and so Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī says they are beyond the influence of time, kālātītāḥ. Prahlada Mahārāja is not an ordinary devotee, yet even he desires to serve the Lord's associates. Therefore, Jiva here defines association with Bhagavan's eternal associates as parama- puruṣārtha, the highest possible good that can be aspired for by conscious beings. 
In the next anuccheda, the transcendental nature of Bhagavan's abode and His associates will be shown simultaneously.

All of them are of the nature of unal- loyed being (suddha-sattva) and are known as brahmananda- sukha, the joy and bliss of Brahman. They are all eternal, immutable and devoid of the lower gunas; they are golden, pure and brilliant as a million suns. They are all full of Vedic knowl- edge, divine and free from the defects of lust and greed. They relish only the nectar of unalloyed devotional service to Śrī Nārā- yana's lotus feet.

The dimension of threefold being (tripada-vibhuti) is eternal, but the dimension oof onefold being (päda-vibhuti) is ephemeral.

In this verse the two terms, "the immortal" (amṛta) and "fearless- ness" (abhaya), are also indicative of a third item, namely, "wel- fare" (kşema), cited in the verse that follows, as will be discussed.* In the Śruti mantra also it is said, "He is the Master of immortality (amṛtatva)" (RV 10.90.2), so immortality is there indicative of the other two items. The distinction between the two statements is that in the above verse, amṛta denotes the Entity (or the place) to whom the attribute of immortality belongs, while the Śruti state- ment (amṛtatva) signifies just the attribute itself; nevertheless, it should also be taken to indicate, by extension of meaning, the Entity to whom such an attribute belongs.val bus ad h

As for fearlessness, the statement, "Nor is there any influence of time there" (SB 2.9.10), indicates that there is absolutely no trace of fear in Vaikuntha. And so, Śrī Sūta said, "O brāhmaṇas, that abode is free of fear" (SB 12.11.19).

Kṣema is explained in SB 2.9.10, "There is no māyā in that world."" According to this statement, kşema, or welfare, should be under- stood as Vaikuntha's inherent quality of being the repository of all-auspiciousness, present unconditionally as all-consuming devotion and love for the all-encompassing Supreme Person, Śri Bhagavan. In that abode, such auspicious devotion is the natural state of being, since there is no contact with the material gunas that divert attention and awareness away from the simple and obvious, moment to moment, recognition of God.

By an inappropriate stretch of imagination, one might indirectly interpret the above words as referring to Janaloka or other sim- ilar material realms in the upper stratum of the universe. To refute this possibility, Śrī Śuka says that abode is "beyond mor- tality and food" (martyam annam yad atyagat). The word martya means "mortality," as the Lord Himself explains, "Even Brahma, who has a life span lasting a dvi-parardha [amounting to trillions of years], fears Me" (SB 11.10.30).12 
अन्नम् – कर्मादिफलं त्रिलोक्यादिकं यस्मादत्यगात् । अतिक्रम्यैव तत्र विराजत इति । एषः– अमृताद्यैश्वर्यरूपः । दुरत्ययः ब्रह्मचर्यादिभिः केनचिन् मनसाप्यवरोद्धुमशक्यः । 
The word anna (lit., "food") refers to the results of karma in the form of existence in the three divisions of mortal planetary systems. The Lord's abode is situated beyond these three plane- tary systems. "This glory" (of Bhagavan) means the opulences referred to, such as immortality and fearlessness. Being "diffi- cult to understand" (duratyaya) means that Vaikuntha cannot be grasped by anyone through the mind or by following disciplines like brahmacarya.

of being. The interesting point in these verses is that the word loka can mean not only a place, like a world, planet or region, but a per- son as well, so the description given here can be applied both to the spiritual region and to its inhabitants. -sida balle 
Śrī Jiva Prabhu first quotes these verses from Padma Purāņa in order to contextualize his explanation of four verses from the Second Canto. In fact, these verses and those from Bhāgavatam are a Puranic elucidation of the famous Purușa-sūkta of Rg Veda (RV 10.90). Previously in PP 6.223, Lord Siva gave a description of Lakṣmi Devi and said, "In this way, the great goddess Laksmi is glorified in Ṛk-samhita" (evam rk-samhitāyāṁ stūyamānā maheśvari, PP 6.223.31). This makes it clear that what follows there is also based on Ṛk-samhita. 
Similarly, while introducing his comments to chapter 6 of the Second Canto, Śrīdhara Svāmi says: 
stell 
The opulence of the virat form is described in the sixth chapter according to its divisions, such as adhyatma. Everything was previ- ously stated and is confirmed and supported by the Purusa-sukta.3 
BoyFurthermore, in his comments to the verses cited in this section, Śrīdhara Svāmi identifies which Puruşa-sukta verses are being elab- orated on. The Purușa-sukta refers to the material world as pada (RV 10.90.3) and to the spiritual world as tripada. In chapter 5 of the Second Canto, Narada Muni approaches Śrī Brahma to inquire about the support, cause and controller of the universe. In response, Śrī Brahmã describes the material creation, which emanates from the Supreme Lord. He explains that the universe is the viraṭ-purusa, a form of the Lord. The verses beginning with SB 2.6.14 correspond to the first four Puruṣa-sukta mantras, given below: hershtib of 
Randers 12 sl 
The universal Lord, who is endowed with unlimited heads, eyes and feet, after having encompassed the entire universe, surpasses the cosmic creation by a distance of ten fingers. (RV 10.90.1)14

WM Śrī Bhagavat Sandarbha 
This means that the Lord exists both within and without the uni- verse. The number ten signifies the seven coverings of the universe, each of which is ten times thicker than the preceding one. This is called the daśāngula-nyaya in Vedic terminology: 
This visible universe is the form of the virat-purușa. Whatever existed in the past, or will exist in the future, is also the form of the universal Lord. He is the Lord of immortality and beyond the law of ahe karma, which influences the living beings within the universe. 
All that is seen here is his greatness (mahima). And then, beyond it, is that Purusa, the oldest. All universes and beings are but one dimension (pada) of Him. His threefold dimensionality (tri-pad) is immortal (amṛta) in the sky (divi). 
The Lord's threefold dimensionality of transcendental being is estab- wholished beyond the material world, whereas His onefold dimension- of ality is manifested in this material world. Then again the living beings here tread on the path of consumption [i.e., of pleasurable and painful experience] or of non-consumption [i.e., of liberation], yet the all-pervading Lord is beyond both. (RV 10.90.2-4)15 
These verses of the Purușa-sūkta, as well as the corresponding description of the virat-puruşa, clearly describe two different cre- ations. The living beings are under the law of karma, which is com- pared to food (anna), but the Lord and His devotees are transcenden- tal. The Lord is the controller of immortality, which means that He has the power to award it to others. Sometimes heaven is referred to as a place of immortality. This immortality, however, is not real; it only appears so in comparison to the brief life span of the lower worlds. Thus, fear of death exists even in heaven. bod do orto 
To differentiate the immortality of Vaikuntha from that of the heavenly sphere, Śrī Brahma uses the adjective abhaya, or fearless- ness. Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi says that the immortality and fearlessness

mentioned in SB 2.6.17 (the principal verse under discussion) indi- cate the auspiciousness explicitly referred to in the following verse. Kṣema, or auspiciousness, means that time has no unfavorable influ- ence on the devotees. This means that the devotees residing eter- nally in Vaikuntha never come under the influence of the inauspi- cious material guņas. Therefore, the Lord's abode is called kṣemam sthānam, or a place of auspiciousness. 
These three characteristics of Vaikuntha, amṛta, abhaya and kṣema, are discussed in great detail in chapter 9 of the Second Canto, which describes Śrī Brahma's vision of Vaikuntha and was discussed in detail in Anuccheda 10. 
It is incorrect to interpret this verse or the tripada-vibhuti as referring to planets above heaven, like Janaloka, and not Vaikuntha. The verse says that the Lord is beyond death. In this world every- one is afraid of death, even Śrī Brahma, whose life span is known as a dvi-parardha. This is explained by Śrī Kṛṣṇa in His teachings to Uddhava: niedasonsfugo Ils seu

The Lord is called sthiti-pät, because He is the shelter (sthiti) of all living beings, and because all opulences, beginning with mortal objects, are compared to His feet (pāda), being the sub- stratum (adhiṣṭhāna) of existence. All living beings up to and including His personal associates exist in, or as, this fourfold division of His opulence, or feet. These divisions ( pādas) are here described further : The Lord's material nature (prakrti ) is symbolized as having three heads, representing the tendencies and products of the sättvic, rajasic and tāmasic gunas. Above the three-headed prakṛti shine the Vaikuntha planets, where the attributes of immortality, auspiciousness and fearlessness are eternally established (adhāyi).

mortality alone]. The latter is called tri-pat because it is the place constituted of three qualities of being, namely immortal- ity, auspiciousness and fearlessness. This verse thus explains the meaning of the Ṛk mantra, "All universes and created beings are but one dimension (pada) of Him. His threefold dimension- ality (tri-pāt) is immortal (amṛta) in the sky (divi)" (RV 10.90.3).18 The meaning should be understood in the following way: All uni- verses and all living beings exist in, or as, the total opulence of His being, consisting of the plane of onefold being, as well as the plane of threefold being, which is present in "the sky" (divi), or Vaikuntha, and constituted of immortality, fearlessness and all-auspiciousness. This statement is made considering the one- ness of identity between the support [i.e., the worlds] and the supported [i.e., the living beings].

This same point is also indicated in the Rk mantra by the word punah ("again," Puruşa-sukta 4).

The Lord's threefold dimensionality of transcendental being has its counterpart within the material world. This is implied by the word punah (again) in the fourth mantra from the Puruşa-sukta: 
The Lord's threefold dimensionality of transcendental being is estab- lished beyond the material world, whereas His onefold dimension- ality is manifested in this material world. Then again the living beings here tread on the path of consumption [i.e., of pleasurable

and painful experience] or of non-consumption [i.e., of liberation], yet the all-pervading Lord is beyond both. (RV 10.90.4) 20 
Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi says that the full implication of this word (punah) is explained in SB 2.6.19. Beyond the heavenly planets (Svar- loka) are four planetary systems, Maharloka, Janaloka, Tapoloka and Satyaloka. These represent the tripada-vibhuti, and the three planetary systems below that, Bhūloka, Bhuvarloka and Svarloka, represent the ekapada-vibhuti. The ekapada-vibhuti is the place for the grha-medhi, or the person whose attention and awareness is anchored in the home (grha eva medha buddhir yasya sa gṛha-medhi). 
The word gṛha, though literally meaning "home," implies a wife, as it is said, "A house alone is not a home; rather, a wife, or she who keeps the home, is what is called a home" (na grham gṛham ity ahur grhini gṛham ucyate). For a gṛhastha, a house or home has no mean- ing without a wife. Therefore, the real meaning of the above state- ment (SB 2.6.19) is that the ekapada-vibhuti is meant for those whose attention is anchored in the husband or wife, as the basis of psycho- sexual and emotional gratification. Such people rotate within the three material spheres. They cannot ascend beyond the heavenly planets. Śrīdhara Svāmī explains that although Maharloka is the place wherein gradual liberation (krama-mukti) is initiated, the hap- piness there is perishable, because at the end of Śri Brahma's day, the residents feel the heat emanating from the mouth of Sankar- ṣaṇa, during the partial devastation. The happiness of people in Janaloka, however, is indestructible. They do not have to leave their abode at the end of Brahma's day. Therefore, Janaloka represents amṛta, or immortality. The residents of Janaloka see people falling from Maharloka, and this brings them distress. However, that is the extent of their suffering. The residents of Tapoloka, on the other hand, are completely aloof from suffering. So Tapoloka represents kşema, or auspiciousness. Satyaloka, however, is the place of abhaya, or fearlessness, because its residents achieve liberation along with Brahmä:

The living being moves either on the path of consumption (sāśana), or of non-consumption (anasana). But the all-pervad- ing Supreme Person is beyond both, because He is the shelter of both wisdom and nescience. (SB 2.6.20)22

Visvak means all-pervading, and puruşa means the Supreme Per- son. The two paths, characterized by material entanglement and liberation, are the destinations of the living beings. But the Lord is beyond (vicakrame) both. Which two specifically? Both the path of consumption, which implies both suffering and enjoy- ment of the fruits of karma, and that of non-consumption, or in other words, the path of transcendence of karma. The reason the Lord is transcendental to both is that He is their shelter. These

two paths are for the jiva. For living beings on the path of con- sumption, nescience (avidya) or mayā is the shelter, and for liv- ing beings on the path of non-consumption, wisdom (vidya) or the Lord's own internal conscious (cit) potency is the shelter. But the Supreme Lord is the shelter of both of these. This is stated later in verses such as, "From Him is generated the universal egg, along with His universal form" (SB 2.6.21).23

The import is that whether from the point of view of His com- plete opulence [both infinite and finite potencies inclusive] or from that of His limited opulence [finite potency only, in the form of material nature and the cosmos], the Lord encompasses four dimensions of being (catuspättva), [namely, mortality, immortality, fearlessness and all-auspiciousness]. 
Commentary 
SB 2.6.20 describes two paths that conditioned beings traverse. Asana means to eat or consume, and thus sāśana implies the path of material experience. This is the path of avidya, or nescience. Anasana (non-consumption) means the path of detachment. This is the path of vidya, or wisdom. The Puruşa, or Lord, is the shelter of both, and so it is He who awards the results of both. It is not that the result is automatically assured by personal endeavor alone, or by following a particular method:

According to eternal verdict, one may leave the world either through the path of light or through the path of darkness. One of the paths does not lead to return, whereas, the other brings one back again. (GĪTĀ 8.26)24 
Brahma says that the Lord is the shelter of these two paths:

The conclusion of the above discussion is that to reach even the higher material planets beyond heaven, one must observe the bṛhad- vrata, the formidable vow of celibacy. This means that one has to adhere to the path of detachment. Certainly then, to go beyond the material world and reach Vaikuntha, one must be completely transcendental to the material gunas. This proves once again that Vaikuntha and its residents are transcendental. al 30 ferit mon) 
In the next anuccheda, Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī will describe the expe- rience of the four Kumāras to show that Vaikuntha and its residents are a manifestation of Bhagavan's internal potency.

'Cherished by the noble' (ārya-hṛdya) means that the awareness of those who are noble [by virtue of the life of Spirit] is captivated by Him. The import of the statement, 'He came walking' (caranau calayan), is as follows. [The Lord deliberated:] 'By showing them My feet, I will alleviate their anger, which arose due to being denied that sight.' Therefore, to show His urgency, He came on foot. He came along with śrī, the Goddess of Fortune, meaning that although the sages were without desire (nişkāma), He intended to make them complete by revealing His own internal opulence, and thus invoke their forgiveness.'

In this description, Bhagavan's nature as the condensed essence of eternality, consciousness and bliss (sat-cit-ananda-ghana) is shown in His intent to give bliss to the Kumāras, even though they were already absorbed in the bliss of the Self, simply by showing His feet. That He appeared with Lakṣmi (Śrī) means that the manifestation of His conscious internal potency (cit-śakti) is nondifferent from His essential nature (svarupa). Though the offence was committed by two devotees only, the use of the plural (svānām) implies that His entire retinue was implicated. Alterna- tively, the use of the plural' here may be a sign of respect to Jaya and Vijaya. The words "His own" (sva) [for Jaya and Vijaya] fur- ther indicate that the Kumāras were not included as part of His inner circle, as was the case for Jaya and Vijaya. 
Commentary 
m 
esbegiraib golob pa ni bac 
AFTER PROVING that Vaikuntha as well as the Lord's associates are part of His svarupa, Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī fortifies his arguments still further by citing the experience of the jñāni-gurus, the Brahman- realized Kumāras. The four Kumāras were the first sons of Śrī Brahma, and are regarded as the foremost of the Brahmavādīs and paramahamsas; thus, their conclusion is considered definitive. 
The Kumāras are celebrated in Chandogya Upanisad as the spiri- tual teachers of the great sage Narada. When Narada approached Sanat Kumāra for instruction, the latter inquired about Narada's 
tvara-vyajena padbhyam eva yayau. śri-sahityaṁ ca nişkämän api vibhutibhiḥ purayitva kṣamāpayitum iti. 
The use of the plural for an individual, or in this case a pair of individuals (which would normally be in the dual number), is a way of showing respect in the Sanskrit language. 
"Narada approached Sanat Kumara, saying, 'Teach me, O venerable sir"" (om adhihi bhagava iti hopasasada sanat-kumāram nāradas tam, CHU 7.1.1).

education so that he could begin his teachings from the appropriate point. In response, Śrī Nārada humbly stated that he had studied the four Vedas, Itihāsas, Purāņas, grammar, mathematics, mineral- ogy, logic, ethics, etymology and so on. Judging from the immense qualification of the student, one can only imagine the extent of the Kumara's knowledge and realization. So, Śrī Brahma refers to them in this verse as paramahamsa-maha-munayaḥ, highly enlightened great sages. 
Moreover, Śrī Sūta Gosvāmī includes the Kumāras in his list of the prime avataras of the Lord (SB 1.3.6). They are also known as the original preceptors of one of the four most prominent Vaiṣṇava sampradayas. This is stated in Padma Purana: 
The four Vaiṣṇava disciplic successions, Śrī, Brahma, Rudra and Sanaka (or Kumāra), which all purify the earth, will arise from v du Jagannatha Puri in Orissa in the age of Kali. Lakṣmi Devi empowered ar zilŚrī Rāmānujācārya, Śrī Brahma empowered Madhvācārya, Rudra 
empowered Visņu Svāmī, and the four Kumāras empowered Śrī Nimbārkācārya, to each propagate their respective sampradayas. 
With all this in mind, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi recounts the experi- ence of the Kumāras in this section, and in so doing dismantles the dazzling Advaitavada edifice. To the Vaisnavas, this section, which establishes the transcendental and nondual nature of Bhaga- vān's form and lila, and of unalloyed love for Him, is like soothing moonlight for their water lily like hearts? 
BaŚrīla Jiva Gosvāmī quotes fourteen verses from chapter 15 of the Third Canto, which describes the Kumāras' visit to Vaikuntha. When the most formidable asuras, Hiranyākṣa and Hiranyakasipu, were in the womb of Diti, the brilliance of Surya and the other gods was sud- denly curtailed, exactly as a person's vital energy is diminished prior to an attack of malaria. The gods approached Śri Brahma to find out

the reason for this occurrence. At that meeting Brahma narrated the story of the Kumāras' visit to Vaikuntha.goylashda asen 
Once upon a time, the Kumāras went to Śrī Visnu's abode. They were most eager to see the Lord and successfully passed through six outer gates on the way to the Lord's inner chambers. At the seventh and innermost gate, which signifies pure love, however, they were stopped by the two gatekeepers, Jaya and Vijaya. 
Although the Kumāras are the first, and hence the oldest, beings brought forth by Śrī Brahma in the creation, they appear to be just five-year-old boys. As they are completely absorbed in brahma- nanda, they are completely indifferent to their appearance and go everywhere naked. Their nakedness symbolizes not only that they are devoid of any tinge of materialism, but also of prema, the requisite qualification to see the Lord. 
Jaya and Vijaya were alarmed to see four children, clad only in their skin, approach the final entrance to the Lord's abode, and so they blocked the Kumāras' entry with stern expressions, brandish- ing wooden staves. This incensed the sages, who merited honor and reverence, and were at that moment unable to tolerate any obstruction to their meeting with the Lord.own adjednom so 
Since one of the characteristics of a Brahman-realized being is equanimity, the Kumāras were moreover surprised to discover that here before them were two residents of Vaikuntha who seemed to be devoid of such equal vision. Considering the two gatekeepers unfit to reside in Vaikuntha, the one place that is free from all duality, they cursed them to take birth in the material world. The Kumāras' reac- tion shows that even Brahman-realized jñānīs are unable to compre- hend the behavior of a devotee of the complete Absolute, Bhagavan. 
Upon hearing the words of the Kumāras, which reverberated like thunderbolts, Jaya and Vijaya fell at their feet in an attempt to pacify them. The Lord, who was inside the palace, understood the whole situation and immediately walked to the gate. The first of the four- teen verses cited in this section describes how the Lord came on the 
scene. 
Each of the fourteen verses is pregnant with meaning, and Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi thoroughly explains each one (Anucchedas 79.1-14). At 
725 
paniel Kapsalo Śrī Bhagavat Sandarbha Bintang 
the end of this group of verses (Anucchedas 79.15-16) he also sum- marizes the underlying themes. In the context of this discussion, Jiva Gosvāmi vehemently repudiates the radical Advaitavada posi- tion that the Lord has no transcendental form. He raises objections on their behalf that even they themselves would probably not be able to imagine. Śrī Jiva thus leaves no doubt regarding his conclusion. 
In this first verse, the word bhagavan indicates that the Lord, being omniscient, instantly understood the offense created by His servants, even though no one came to inform Him. Thus, He came to the scene immediately (tadaiva). The Lord was not at all confused about who was the wrongdoer, nor did He choose to favor His guests, the Kumāras, over His devotees, Jaya and Vijaya. Thus, He is called arya-hṛdyaḥ, "cherished by the noble," meaning that His form and behavior captivates the awareness of those who are awake to Spirit. The word arya, or one grounded in Spirit, has a particular sense in Vedic culture. Amongst other characteristics, Aryans hold all guests to be worshipable. 
onŚrī Brahma used the term svänām (His own) to designate Jaya and Vijaya; this indicates that the Lord did not consider the Kumāras to be members of His own entourage. Thus, He came running to the spot, as a mistake committed by a dear subordinate implicates the master (bhṛtyāparādhe svamino dandyah): h 
When a servant commits a sin, people in general blame his master. Such notoriety ruins the master's reputation, as much as white lep- rosy does a person's skin. (SB 3.16.5) 
Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī also points out that the pronoun svänām is in the plural number. If this term were being used to indicate Jaya and Vijaya only, the dual form (svayoh) would have been used. Use of the plural implies that the Lord considered all Vaikuntha residents to be implicated in the offense, indicating the unity among liberated devo- tees and the intense loving relation that exists among them. This is complete nonduality, advaya-jñāna, not radical or partial nonduality that can account for oneness only through mere negation of dualism.

79 The Threefold Spiritual Manifestation Is Part of the Internal Potency 
Since the Kumāras were angry owing to not being able to see the feet of the Lord, the Lord came to the scene by foot, thinking He would pacify them by allowing them to see His feet in action. This hints at His subtle wisdom. Alternatively, He might have gone bare- foot to show respect to the Kumāras, as one does in Vedic culture upon receiving honorable guests. It could also be that the Lord came outside the gate to uphold the gatekeepers' decision not to let the Kumāras enter Vaikuntha - indeed, Bhagavatam nowhere indicates that they were ever able to do so. By then granting the Kumāras a vision of His lotus feet, He simultaneously defused the situation, thus fulfilling their main purpose in coming. In this way, everyone would be satisfied and no transgressions would be made. 
The Lord came with Śrī (Lakṣmi Devi) to show the Kumāras that He has nothing to hide. Śrīla Viśvanatha Cakravarti Thakura explains that He also wanted to bless the Kumāras who, up to that point, had experience only of the material Śrī. Or, the Lord brought Śrī with Him thinking that it would be easier for her to placate the angry boys than for Him. 
và t 
Śrī Vamsidhara also postulates that the Lord brought Śrī because the Kumāras were naisthika-brahmacaris and would bring their anger under control in her presence, since men, especially brah- macārīs, are generally better behaved when in the company of women. Or, Śrī simply followed out of curiosity to find out how the Lord would deal with such a complex situation. 
On the whole, Śrī is Bhagavan's internal potency and can never be separated from Him. This is the principal meaning of Her coming with the Lord. 
That the Kumāras were enraged for being prohibited from see- ing the Lord, and then immediately delighted upon seeing Him, indicates that the Lord is sat-cit-ananda, as He could award bliss even to the Kumāras, who are paramahamsa-maha-munis-highly enlightened liberated sages. It also indicates that the bliss of realiza- tion of the complete Absolute, Bhagavan, surpasses, and hence also includes, the bliss of realization of Brahman. 
Thus, this verse's purport is that the Lord's feet are worshipable even by the Kumāras.

In the next five verses Śrī Brahma describes the Lord as He was seen by the Kumāras. The word "they" here means the four Kumāras. The very Brahman that was the greatly auspicious outcome (bhagya), or in other words, the utter fulfillment of the sages' meditative trance (samadhi), [though imperceptible to the senses] was now visible directly before their eyes.

Alternatively, the phrase sva-samadhi-bhagya here means that the Supreme Truth in the form of Brahman manifested in their own hearts, as the greatly auspicious outcome of their medita- tive trance. As a consequence of this, that Supreme Truth became

directly visible to their eyes. This means that the sages were now clearly experiencing Him, because He made Himself perceiv- able to the total quantum of their mind and senses, which had been purified, and thus attuned to Spirit, by His self-illuminating potency. As before, this incident again illustrates that all the characteristics of Bhagavän, such as sound, touch, form, taste and smell, are completely transcendental, being of the essence of condensed eternity, consciousness and bliss (sat-cit-ananda).

The personal associates of the Lord constantly ministered to the Lord with various paraphernalia they had brought with them for that purpose. They did so in great loving bliss, as they expe- rienced the varieties of sweetness that arose spontaneously, moment to moment, in Him. It was exactly at that moment, out of all possible moments, places and circumstances, that the Kuma- ras were somehow enabled just to see the Lord [yet not to render service], owing to some extraordinary fortune that arose from their trance. The Kumāras were already awake to the supreme wisdom of enlightenment, so the fact that they aspired there- after to attain the consciousness and existential disposition of a servant of the Lord shows that these liberated servants from Vaikuntha are manifestations of some particular bliss potency of the Lord.

When the Kumāras saw the majestic gait of the Lord, they completely forgot their anger. Their eyes were transfixed on Him, as they had never experienced such exquisite beauty and magnificence. The bliss of brahmananda was completely overwhelmed by the beatific vision of the Lord. The form they experienced will be described over 
i Lanz15 the next five verses. od brod ant 
The Kumāras saw the Lord being served by His personal asso- ciates, who had brought the appropriate paraphernalia for such service. This verse states that He became the object of their vision. The conventional rule is that all visible objects are material, but this does not mean that the Lord's form is so. To make this clear, the verse says that they were enabled to behold the Lord as a result of their trance-sva-samadhi-bhagya. The Kumāras were previ- ously absorbed in Brahman realization and situated in the self- viditätma-tattvän (SB 3.15.30).

They were able to recognize that their vision of the Lord was the result of their samadhi. This means that they considered Brah- man, which they were habituated to witness in trance, to be visi- ble now before them, as a trans-conventional person. The Lord can- not be considered material, as nothing of that nature could excite the Kumāras, who were completely free from all material desires — vigata-spṛhah (SB 3.15.12).

Not only the Lord, but even the paraphernalia used in His ser- vice is transcendental. This is evident, as the Lord's paraphernalia also caused upheavals of love in the hearts of the Kumāras. They could understand that the Lord and His paraphernalia were of the same transcendental nature as that they had previously experienced in trance. This recognition is signified in the phrase sva-samādhi- bhagya. 
Recognition has two features - remembrance of past experi- ence and simultaneous direct perception of the object. The combi- nation of these two is called recognition. Because the Kumāras' past experience of Brahman in trance was not material, the Lord and all the objects used in His service could not be material. Therefore, by the process of elimination (anyathānupapatti-pramāna) we must conclude that the Lord had blessed the Kumāras with His internal potency so that they could see Him through their own eyes. Pre- viously they had been able to experience the Lord only in trance (arya-hṛdyah), but now He who is imperceptible became the object of their vision (acakṣatākṣa-viṣaya). 
Another important implication of the words acakṣatākṣa-viṣaya is that the Kumāras were permitted only to see the Lord being served by His devotees (sva-pumbhih), yet were not given the chance to serve Him personally. Sva-pumbhiḥ (by His own people) also implies that the Kumāras could sense that they were not part of the Lord's intimate circle, as had already been intimated in the previous verse. 
The enchanting beauty of the Lord's paraphernalia is described in the second half of the verse through the beautiful poetic ornament (alankara) called atiśayokti (hyperbole). The mention of this para- phernalia implies that it had caught the attention of the Kumāras.

The Lord, smiling benevolently at all, being the abode of com- #ileplete desirability, touched their hearts with His glances of affec-Div vartion. By the presence of the Goddess of Fortune, Śrī, on His broad, alr black, beautiful chest, it appeared as though He were radiating well-being throughout His own abode, the crest-jewel of heavens.

The word "all" (kṛtsnasya) here refers to both the gatekeepers and the sages. The Lord smiled beautifully (sumukha) at all of them, as if to bestow grace upon all (prasāde). The phrase "the abode of complete desirability" (spṛhaniya-dhama) means that He is the ground and reservoir of all desirable attributes. This shows that these attributes are also of the same transcendental nature as Him. "Glances of affection" (snehavaloka) indicate that His actions are also transcendental.walt won Hid (doynoyin

In Krama-sandarbha, however, Śrī Jiva Prabhu says that the Kumāras were completely (kṛtsna) satisfied (prasāda) on seeing the Lord, but that the gatekeepers, Jaya and Vijaya, were not feeling so content, as is evident from the Lord's own statement at the beginning of the next chapter:

THE 
be Śrīla Viśvanatha Cakravarti Thakura also accords with this alter- nate line of interpretation. He writes that when the Kumāras saw the Lord approaching in all His majesty, they were at first sub- merged in an ocean of doubt. They had cursed the Lord's dear asso- ciates and were thus unsure whether He would be upset with them or not. Their doubt was removed, however, as is indicated by the phrase, "being merciful to all" (kṛtsna-prasāda-sumukha, SB 3.15.39). The Lord was bestowing His mercy upon all, but not, apparently, on the gatekeepers. 
Though the Lord's mercy did not here explicitly fall on the gate- keepers, internally He was pleased with them, as is clear from another statement He makes later on: 
mel 
V abods al 
The Lord said to His attendants, Jaya and Vijaya, "Go, but fear not. May peace be with you. Though I am capable of retracting the brāh- manas' curse, I do not wish to do so. On the contrary, I approve of it. (SB 3.16.29)16 
The verse under discussion further states that the Lord touched everyone's heart by His merciful glances. This means that He blessed everyone. It also implies that the Lord's glance is transcendental; otherwise, it could not have touched the heart of the Kumāras, who were paramahamsa-munis, fixed in Brahman realization. Jaya and Vijaya were feeling morose, anticipating separation from the Lord. Understanding the inner feelings of His dear devotees, the Lord affectionately glanced at them (snehavaloka-kalaya) and soothed their hearts (hrdi samspṛśantam). 19 degnilsel on sew 
The Kumāras received a glimpse of the Lord's wonderful char- acter by witnessing Him extend His mercy to them, despite their having caused a disturbance by cursing His confidential servants and associates. On the other hand, they had been unable to tolerate

even a little disturbance. Thus, the Lord is called spṛhaniya-dhāma, the abode of all desirable qualities. This indicates that the Kuma- ras lacked such qualities, even though they were perfected beings (siddha-puruşa). 
Since it is the duty of gatekeepers to stop visitors and inquire about their purpose, the Kumāras had no real reason to be upset with them. Nevertheless, the Lord was far from being upset with the Kumāras for their prideful act, and was even very respectful and merciful to them. This is evident from the Lord's words to the Kuma- ras in the following chapter, where He goes to the extent of saying that He Himself has acquired His auspicious qualities by serving sages like them. In this way, the Kumāras directly experienced the benign nature of the Lord. 
пото 
The second half of this verse and the two that follow describe the beauty of the Lord's form. Bhagavan appeared like an abode of for- tune with the golden mark of Lakṣmi above the left breast on His broad black chest. Vaikuntha is the crest-jewel of all planets up to Satyaloka. The Lord appeared like a transcendental ornament that beautified even Vaikuntha. Thus, it is understood that the Kumāras realized the sweetness of the Lord's mercy and His personal beauty.

The Lord was sporting a fine silk dhoti on His broad hips, covered by a beautiful belt, and wore a garland of forest flowers (vana-mālā) around His neck. In his Durgama-sangamini commentary to Bhakti- rasāmṛta-sindhu, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī says that a garland that hangs all the way down to one's feet is called a vana-mālā. Bumblebees were buzzing around the Lord's garland, making it appear to resonate. 
The Lord's dhoti considered His hips to be her exclusive dominion. His belt imposed her supremacy over the dhoti, and the vana-mālā reigned over them both. But the humming bumblebees considered the vana-mālā to be their property. Thus, it appeared that the Lord had awarded supremacy to the bumblebees. It is no surprise, then, that they were humming in jubilation.

After explaining the transcendental nature of even the parapher- nalia of the Lord, Brahma again describes His exquisite loveliness in this verse. The phrase utsmitam indirāyāḥ means "Lakṣmi's pride." The Lord's devotees conjectured that Lakṣmi is in eternal association with the Lord, Her husband, whose beauty exceeds that of billions of Cupids, and therefore, She feels excessive pride for Him. The reason for this is expressed in the statement that He has exquisite beauty (bahu-sauṣṭhavadhya), which is to say that He is eternally endowed with the opulence of His unlimited forms, nature, attributes and so on.

2 975 doidw A doubt may be raised. If the Lord is of this nature, in other words, if He is the supreme Existent and the most highly con- cealed unfathomable treasure, then how can He become manifest [to others], even through the agency of Lakṣmi? This is answered in the third quarter of the verse, beginning with the word mahya, "He manifests His form for the sake of His devotees, like myself (Brahma)." This means that He chooses to make Himself visible to people like us. As Yamunācārya describes in His Stotra-ratna:

In this verse, Śri Brahma again describes the matchless beauty of the Lord, as perceived by the Kumāras. The words utsmita and upasṛsta are understood differently by the various commentators. Accord- ing to Śrīdhara Svāmi, the devotees thought that Lakṣmi had become excessively proud of Her own beauty, but when She was placed next to the Lord, this pride was obscured or eclipsed (astam-gata). Śrī Viśvanatha Cakravarti expands on that idea: Lakṣmi's pride in the thought that she alone was the source of all beauty was broken. Śrī Jiva Prabhu does not accord with this view, however, and says that Laksmi's pride was due to having such a wonderful husband as the

Bahu-sausthavadhya means "the beauty of His bodily limbs." One of the Lord's sixty-four qualities is suramyanga, or "attractiveness of the limbs":

When the bodily limbs are exquisitely formed, it is known as attrac- tiveness of the limbs. (BRS 2.1.45)24 gawin kotovob bayniland 
Seeing such beauty, the Kumāras fell on the ground to offer respect to the Lord out of joy. This also indicates that they gave up the concept of the supremacy of Brahman; otherwise, there would be no need to offer respect to any distinct individual. The beauty of the Lord's body is so ravishing that the Kumāras were not satiated, though they repeatedly gazed at Him (avitṛpta-dṛśa).

devotional love (bhajanananda) is superior to the bliss of mere abidance in one's original state of unqualified being (svarūpā- nanda). When the air mixed with the fragrance of tulasi leaves, smeared with the filaments from the lotus feet of the Lord, entered through its own natural gateways' (sva-vivarena), namely the nostrils of the Kumāras, they experienced a 'com- motion' (sankṣobha) both in mind, manifested as extreme joy, and in body, that is, their hairs stood on end, even though they delighted in the imperishable (aksara-jusa), which is to say, they were absorbed in the bliss of Brahman realization."

It should be explained here that the tulasi leaves from His lotus feet were mixed with lotus filaments. The lotus filaments and tulasi leaves were woven into the forest flower garland that the Lord was wearing at the time. The intent here is that, what to speak of the Lord's bodily limbs and parts, which constitute His very self, even the air that contacted them had the power to cause a commotion in the Kumāras' minds and bodies.

auspicious qualities. The significance is that the liberated being enjoys all these qualities with the Supreme Brahman. The word saha (along with) expresses the preeminence of these attributes, just as [they were similarly specified] in the Dahara-vidya chap- ter of Chandogya Upanisad, 'One should seek out that which is within this sky" (CHU 8.1.1).28 st to all on ad vloman team brim at rod Adderne) hohom has no boots arian riads al sariybod ni bus 
Commentary 
Roussiles asmend to alldady hadrozda stow Śrī Brahma here explains that not only did the Lord's beauty attract the hearts of the Kumāras, but even the air that was in contact with the tulasi and saffron touching His body created a turmoil in the bod- ies and minds of these Brahman-realized beings. This verse explains the pinnacle of the Lord's beauty. The Kumāras were not dreaming, as they experienced a change in heart. This implies that the Lord's body was not a manifestation of some upadhi, or in other words, it was not any kind of material imposition on Spirit. 
The main point is that if even the air in contact with the Lord's body indirectly made the Kumāras completely indifferent to the bliss of Brahman, then how much more blissful must the Lord's own form be? Śrīdhara Svāmi therefore says that this verse confirms that the bliss of bhakti is superior to that of Brahman - svarupānandad api teṣām bhajananandadhikyam. 
Śrīla Viśvanatha Cakravarti Thakura expands on Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi's observation that "what to speak of the Lord's bodily limbs and parts, which constitute His very self, even the air that contacted them had the power to cause a commotion in the Kumāras' minds and bodies." He says that the air simply contacted an object, situ- ated on just one of the Lord's limbs, yet it created such a wonder and inundated the Kumāras with bliss. This being the case, one can- not possibly imagine the sweetness of the Lord's body itself. That fragrant air entered and conquered their hearts. 
bat 
It was improper for the Kumāras to intrude on the Lord, and one might say that it is similarly improper for air to trespass into 
28 
tasmin yad antas tad anveṣṭavyam 
742 
79 The Threefold Spiritual Manifestation Is Part of the Internal Potency 
the inner chambers of one's heart. But the verse says sva-vivarena, "through its [i.e., the air's] own natural gateways." Since the nostrils are the natural passageways for the air, no permission was required for it to enter. 
Upon entering their bodies, this fragrant air churned their hearts and forcibly submerged them into a whirlpool of bliss. It shook their bodies and manifested in them loving ecstatic symptoms, such as trembling, tears, horripilation and perspiration (kampā, aśru, romāñca and sveda). In this world, it is observed that when one country invades another, its army first arrests and harasses the defeated country's leaders before going on to subdue its people. Here, the air, imbued with the fragrance of the Lord's tulasi, simi- larly first captured and caused a commotion in the heart, the con- trolling seat of all the body's functions, before going on to pervade the senses and create an upheaval there. 
In this verse, the phrase, "even though they were established in the bliss of the Imperishable" (aksara-juṣām api), is very signif- icant. Such liberated beings are without attachment to the body or to any objects related to the body and senses, and thus it is not possible to unsettle their hearts with material sense objects. Nor- mally, such Brahman-realized beings display an absence of taste for bhakti-rasa, but this breeze coming from Śrī Nārāyaṇa was so pow- erful that it completely captivated the Kumāras' hearts. This demon- strates that even the air that comes in contact with Bhagavan's per- sonal form, because it is saturated with His mercy, bestows feelings of such incomparable bliss that it makes one indifferent even to the delight of Brahman realization. 1

They looked again and again, as they were unable to capture the loveliness of His whole body all at once. Doing so, they became contemplative (nidadhyuh), which is to say, they became thought- ful (cintayāmāsu). This means they became immersed in think- ing, "How can we behold the whole body of the Lord simultane- ously?" And by these feelings of longing, they experienced the particular ecstatic transitory emotion (vyabhicari-bhāva) called cintă (anxiousness at the non-fulfillment of one's heart-longing), which nourished their foundational and permanent disposition of love (sthayi-bhāva).

While the Kumāras' hearts were thus imbued with love, their eyes enjoyed the beautiful smiling lotus face of the Lord. They were trying to assimilate the Lord's beauty in all its fullness, and so they shifted their gaze from His face to His beautiful lotus feet with its ruby-like nails. Again they raised their eyes and marveled at the sweetness of the Lord's face. Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī says that the word nidadhyu (they contemplated) signifies that the Kumāras manifested a vyabhicārī- bhāva called cintă (anxiousness). This is described by Śrīla Rūpa 
Gosvāmī as follows:

When thought becomes concentrated due to non-attainment of 
one's heart-longing, or due to attainment of that which is unde-d desired, it is called cinta, or anxiousness. The symptoms of this emo- 
tion are sighing, lowering the head, scratching the earth with the Ytoes, change of bodily hue, sleeplessness, moaning, inflammation, od loss of weight, tears and depression.

Śrila Viśvanatha Cakravarti Thakura says that labdhāsiṣa (feel- ing blessed) implies that because the Kumāras had previously been blessed by their father and brother Narada, who are both great devo- tees, they were able to receive the mercy of the Lord. In Bhakti San- darbha, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi explains that generally the Lord doesn't bestow His mercy independently, but blesses those specifically who have received the mercy of His devotees.

The eight supra-mundane opulences refer to the eight paranor- mal powers, such as animā (atomization). In Him, these powers are not mere external characteristics, but are intrinsic to His form. Since the opulence of the Lord, indicated by these supra- mundane powers (aiśvarya), was the Kumāras' object of rever- ence, it indicates that all opulences (bhaga) of the Lord are iden- tical in nature to Him. Samagrṇan means they offered perfect (samyak) praises.

In this verse, Śrī Brahma states that the Lord's body is highly rev- erenced by all transcendentalists and yogis who seek Ultimate Real- ity. The word puṁsām (lit., "of men") carries the broader connota- tion of all human beings, and hence includes both men and women, as those who seek the truth through the path of yoga. Bhagavan's form is described as paumsna, which indicates the form of Garbho- dakaśāyi Viṣṇu, the puruṣāvatāra. Brahma is also an avatara of the Lord but has a different form, which does not resemble that of Visnu. 
The phrase ananya-siddhaiḥ, "which have not been acquired through any other source," implies that Bhagavan's qualities are not extrinsic or acquired, but part of His svarupa. Therefore, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi says that they are not upalakṣita. An upalakṣaṇa is an indi- cator or incidental distinguishing mark that does not inhere in the object or entity indicated, and thus may not always be present. An upalakṣaṇa may function, however, to distinguish one object from another. If, for example, someone points out that the Kadamba tree is the one with the peacock perched in it, the peacock is considered the upalakṣana, or indicator of the Kadamba tree. Although the pea- cock distinguishes that particular Kadamba tree, it is not part of its svarupa, or essential being, because it can fly away at any time. The point is that the Lord's attributes are not upalakṣaṇas; otherwise, they could vanish and He would lose His supremacy. This was dis- cussed in detail in Anuccheda 3 where Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī defined the word bhagavan.

Next, the Kumāras explain the reason why the Lord did not con- ceal Himself from them: "When our father, Śrī Brahma, who was born of You, described Your mysteries, i.e., instructed us in the confidential knowledge of Brahman, at that very time, You entered the core of our hearts (guha) through the ears. This means that You pervaded our intelligence, in that particular form [as Brahman]." Thus, it was said, "Even though they were estab- lished in the bliss of the Imperishable."

The Kumāras had been instructed by Śrī Brahma in the science of the Absolute, and thus the Lord had entered their hearts. Now that He was visible to them directly in His personal form, they remem- bered their father. A disciple never forgets his spiritual teacher and considers everything to be his mercy. 
Factually, what this means is that the form they saw was not dif- ferent from the Brahman that had been described to them in the Vedas by Śrī Brahma. Although the Lord is the all-pervading Brah- man, He manifests His personal form to His devotees. This is con- firmed by vs 3.2.24, cited by Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi. Although the senses do not have the power to perceive the Lord, who remains hidden to conventional awareness, He can be seen by bhakti. Śrī Kṛṣṇa said to Arjuna: 
The 
Ne I cannot be seen in the same manner that you have seen Me simply The through a study of the Veda, nor through serious penances, charity The or worship. O Arjuna, it is only through undivided devotional ser- vice that I can be known in this way, that I can be seen, and indeed, be entered into. (GĪTĀ 11.53-54)35

Bhakti can be received only by the mercy of a devotee. The Kuma- ras had received the auspicious fortune to associate with Śrī Brahmā, a great bhakta of the Lord.

In other words, for all this time we did not know You, but now we have come to know You clearly, through direct expe- rience. Just as You manifest internally as Brahman in the state of pure awareness, free from mental modifications (citta-vṛtti), You are now also manifest to our eyes." The sense is that the Kuma- ras recognized the Lord because He Himself manifested Himself before them through His internal potency, and not because He can be seen by the eyes [like other visible forms].

The Kumāras addressed the Lord as the truth of the Self (atma- tattva), indicating that not only they, but other ātmārāmas besides themselves also have no attraction for anything else [other than ātma-tattva], since they are free of material ego pride. Nevertheless, they also state that this atma-tattva appears in a distinct way according to the particular practice (sādhanā) one follows: "The atma-tattva that appears as Your personal form can be known only by staunch devotional service (drdha-bhakti- yogaiḥ), which is understood by anutapa alone, which here means by Your 'mercy' (kṛpā)." onlinem aldr Hguod rew

To ano al vilimono.pl The Kumāras answer, "Those who have cut asunder the knots in their hearts" (udgranthayah), or in other words, "those devoid of material ego and pride" (nirahammānāḥ), and who are thus "free from material attachment" (virāgāḥ). As such, the word raha (mystery) in the phrase from the previous verse, "the mysteries described by our father" (pitrāṇuvarnita-rahaḥ), implies loving devotion, as it also does in the context of the four seed verses of Srimad Bhagavatam.37 
Commentary 
The Lord raises a doubt: "Brahma instructed you in the philosophical truth of the Self (atma-tattva), or Brahman. But since that truth is beyond the senses, whereas I am visible, I must be different from it. So how can you claim that you are now directly seeing the mystery (raha) that Brahma described to you?" 
In response, the Kumāras say that they recognize the Lord as the same ātma-tattva. In addition, however, they mention that this manifestation has two particularities: It has a form constituted of unalloyed being (sattvena), and it induces love (ratim racayantam). Not only the Kumāras, but other sages who are free from material attachment (munayo virāgāḥ) attain the Lord through firm devotion, performed with humility (anutapa-viditaiḥ). 
The popular meaning of the word anutapa is remorse, or peni- tence, and it has been understood as such in SB 3.14.44 and SB 3.15.36. In the latter verse, directly connected to the events being narrated, Śrīdhara Svāmi glosses it as kṛpā-nimitto'nutāpaḥ, or "the remorse that was induced by the Lord's mercy." It is for this reason that Śrī 
37 See Section 96. 
753 
astollensat sdo Śri Bhagavat Sandarbha 
Jiva Prabhu has given mercy as the first meaning of anutapa here in this context. In fact, for the ordinary jiva lost in the material world, an awareness of the deluded nature of conditioned life leads to pen- itence or humility. This comes about only by the grace of the Lord and His devotees. 
Dainya, or humility, is one of the six components of saraṇāgati, or surrender to the Lord, which are the first steps in devotion. In this case, the Kumāras were expressing remorse for their act of cursing the two gatekeepers. An example of dainya, given in BRS 2.4.21, is that of Mucukunda, who prayed as follows: 
O Supreme Self! For so long I have been pained by miseries in this world and have been burning with remorse (anutapa) for my sins. The six enemies are never satisfied, and so I can find no peace. Please protect me, O giver of shelter, for I am in danger and have approached Your lotus feet, the source of fearlessness, immortality and freedom from sorrow. (SB 10.51.58)38 
In the verse under discussion, the Kumāras are once again indi- cating that Brahman is a feature of Bhagavan, and that Bhagavan is the more complete, or in other words, the more inclusive Reality. Śrī Kṛṣṇa says that He is the basis of Brahman (brahmano hi pratiṣṭhā- ham); otherwise, it would not have been possible for the Kumāras to recognize the Lord as the same Brahman.

Although the Kumāras had previously adopted the doctrine of absolute non-distinction [also known as Radical Nondualism], they had now become aware of [transcendental] varieties within the Absolute, manifested by the actions of the internal potency of bliss. So, in this verse, they glorified the abundance of bliss felt by devotees. In doing so, their intention is to pray for the boon of devotional service alone, which accommodates distinction within the nondual unity. The devotees do not consider even the "ultimate" (atyantika), namely liberation, as the Lord's mercy, what to speak of anything else, such as the post of Lord Indra. 
Piere of Twistor Commentary 
Ad balla

In this verse, the Kumāras' intention is expressed even more explic- itly. Atyantika (the ultimate) refers to liberation. Devotees who have been blessed with a taste of the Lord's pastimes give no importance to liberation, rather they abhor it, because liberation is devoid of tran- scendental variety and hence does not afford one the possibility of rendering service to the Lord. As such, it cannot compare even to a drop of the bliss of devotion. Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmi confirms this in Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu: "If the bliss of Brahman realization were to be multiplied billions of times, it still could not compare even to a drop from the ocean of bliss that is bhakti" (BRS 1.1.38).

devotees do not accept liberation, even if the Lord offers it to them. Śri Kapila said:lang

Without devotional service, pure devotees do not accept any kind of liberation - salokya, sārṣṭi, sāmipya, sarūpya or ekatva - even if 15offered by the Supreme Lord Himself. (SB 3.29.13)41 
Śrīla Viśvanatha Cakravarti Thakura says that the bliss of being in the direct presence of the Lord is, of course, superior to brahma- nanda, but the point of this verse is to show that so too is the experi- ence of hearing hari-katha, even when not in the direct presence of the Lord.42 Thus, the Kumāras say that only those blessed with aware- ness of the aesthetic relish of such katha (rasajñāḥ) are truly expert (kuśalāḥ). 
Moreover, śravana is the first step in devotional service. If even those dedicated to hearing the Lord's pastimes have no regard for lib- eration, then it goes without saying that those who are firmly estab- lished in a personal relationship with the Lord care nothing for it. It is observed that people in general take great interest in gossiping about ephemeral, "so-called" beauty, and show no interest in spir- itual life. If one can become absorbed in hearing about dead bod- ies, full of stool, urine, blood and bones, which have no real beauty in them, then one can only imagine the deep meditation of those who hear about the super-excellent dealings of the transcendentally beautiful Lord with His wonderful loving devotees. w bazald -ns to biovsh al noitredil sausood Jizorda vadi/disto 16 yillidizzoq edi uno biofis ton asub sansi bn ys

Brahma-sutra states, "Upon awakening to knowledge of the Abso- lute, sins performed in the present life do not cling to one, and those committed in the past are completely destroyed. This is declared in the Upanisads" (vs 4.1.13).44 According to this princi- ple, sin is impossible for Brahman-realized beings, even if they may be devoid of devotion to the Lord. And yet the Kumāras asked for forgiveness from enormous sins that would consign them to hell for a long time. This points to the most astonishing glories of the Lord and the Kumāras, as expressed in the ātmārāma verse (SB 1.7.10), that "All varieties of atmarāmas, especially those estab- lished on the path of self-realization, though freed from all kinds of material bondage, desire to render unalloyed devotional ser- vice unto the Supreme Lord. Indeed, such are the transcenden- tal qualities of the Lord that He can attract everyone, including liberated beings."45

It should be understood that this incident of the Lord forgiv- ing His devotees' transgression, came about from the mere sem- blance of an offense resulting from the sages' anger, which the Lord orchestrated out of His own will. The self-evident conclu- sion of these two verses is that even dwelling in hell is superior to liberation in the form of extinction in Brahman, because at least residence in hell is not antagonistic to devotional service, which was the Kumāras' one and only aspiration. mosque star sol gaihalani qoray 
Commentary 
This verse points out the difference between a jñānī and a bhakta. Previously the Kumāras had become incensed by just a slight obstruction, caused by the gatekeepers, but since they had been blessed by bhakti, they were prepared even to suffer in hell, pro- vided they could hear and chant about the Lord. The implication is 
758 
79 The Threefold Spiritual Manifestation Is Part of the Internal Potency 
that the Kumāras had realized that the root cause of all problems is the state or condition of being unfavorably disposed towards the Lord. Thus, they declared that they were ready to suffer any amount (kāmam), yet also prayed that they would not be afflicted by the disease of non-devotion. 
Devotees fear only one thing: committing offenses that would cause their devotion to be covered. They consider heaven and hell to be equal. Śrī Rudra said: bit wat post 
The devotees who are completely dedicated to Śrī Nārāyaṇa do not fear anything at all. They regard all circumstances as equal, whether it be promotion to heaven, liberation from material existence, or dwelling in hell. (SB 6.17.28)46bros al 
The Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī points out that for jñānis like the Kumāras, there is no possibility of sin, quoting vs 4.1.13. The Lord's qualities, however, are so wonderful that they humbled and captivated the hearts of these great sages, so much so that they were willing to go to hell if it afforded them the opportunity to remember Bhagavan. 
A famous brahma-jñāni of medieval times experienced the importance of bhakti and was moved to write: 
We were revered by the adherents of the path of monism, and had been placed on the throne of the joy of impersonal realization. Yet we were forcibly transformed into maidservants by some cheater, that roguish lover of the gopis. (BRS 3.1.44)*7 
The verse under discussion indicates that the Kumāras would rather be in hell as devotees than to gain liberation as extinction in Brahman, devoid of devotion. It also implies that they would have preferred to be in hell where they would never commit offenses to devotees, thus safeguarding their devotion. Or, they might have

thought that if they suffered in hell, they would be inspired to remember the Lord, as people in general remember Him when suf- fering, but forget Him when intoxicated by wealth, position, or non-theistic knowledge. Śrī Narada confirms this: 
bil For the wicked, who are blinded by the intoxication of wealth, for poverty is the best medicine. A poverty-stricken man sees very clearly how others suffer by reference to his own experience. (SB 10.10.13) 48 
The Kumāras preferred to be in hell as devotees than in Vai- kuntha as offenders. This accords with the principle of surren- der - to accept everything favorable to bhakti and reject everything unfavorable (HBV 11.676).491 to aton 
Śrīla Viśvanatha Cakravarti Thakura says that the Kumāras were praying to engage their mind, speech and ears in the service of the Lord, but not with the purpose of attaining brahmananda. Just as the bumblebee never relinquishes its attachment to flowers, despite often being pierced by thorns, similarly the Kumāras were deter- mined to serve the Lord's lotus feet in spite of all impediments. Such an attitude is evidence of prema, or unconditional love. 
Viśvanatha says that the first implication of the Kumāras' prayer is that their ears should be filled completely with the Lord's qualities. According to the Nyaya philosophy, however, the sense (indriya) of hearing is understood as the sky enclosed within the ear hole. Sound is a quality of the sky or ether (sabda-guṇakam ākāśam, Tarka- sangraha 2.5). Since qualities are formless and the sky is unlim- ited, the sense of hearing, or in other words, the ear, can never be filled completely. This means that one can go on hearing about the qualities of the Lord and never be satiated. This is the underlying implication of this prayer. den inb

Since the Kumāras were brahma-jñānis and then prayed for devotional ser- vice, this indicates that bhakti, or loving devotional service, is the pañcama-puruṣārtha - the fifth and topmost goal of human life. 
This unique paradigm is found specifically in Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava philosophy. Before the advent of Śrī Caitanya Mahaprabhu, the majority of Indian philosophers considered liberation (moksa) to

be the ultimate goal of life. Śrī Caitanya Mahaprabhu, however, said that Srimad Bhagavatam carries one beyond mukti and reveals the most confidential secret (rahasya) - love of Kṛṣṇa. Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmi is systematically divulging this secret in his analysis of Srimad Bhagavatam. 
The stories of Srimad Bhagavatam are pregnant with pertinent philosophical conclusions. This description of the Kumāras' attempt to enter Vaikuntha is especially included by Śrīla Vyasa to enable brahma-jñānis to see beyond the a priori assumptions that limit the Absolute to Brahman, thus providing them with the possibility of further completion through devotion. It is very interesting that Brahma sent his own sons, the best of the jñānis, to Vaikuntha and made them experience the superiority of bhakti-ānanda over brah- mānanda. The discerning jñāni should learn a lesson from this.

Now follows the discussion. The Kumāras were the spiritual teachers even of all other spiritual teachers past and present, who had attained completion in knowledge of Brahman. There- fore, it was stated that they were "highly enlightened liberated sages" [paramahamsa-maha-muninām, SB 3.15.37]. This is popu- larly known from such statements as: "King Amśuman said, 'O my Lord, sages free from the influence of the three gunas of mate- rial nature, like the four Kumāras, are able to think of You, who are highly condensed unadulterated awareness; but how can an ignorant person like me think of You" (SB 9.8.24)?51

Consequently, Śrīdhara Svāmi has also explained that the anger displayed by the Kumāras, who had shattered the bonds of māyā and the products of her various gunas, such as delusion, was due to the supreme will of the Lord, which makes possible even the impossible.

But the Kumāras' awareness was fully absorbed in the Lord, since it was said in SB 3.15.37, "The Lord's feet are to be sought out by highly enlightened liberated sages."59 The use of the word anveṣaṇīya, "are to be sought out," with regards to the Lord's feet does not contradict the idea that [their attraction to the Lord] was spontaneous (yadṛcchika).60

The following prose paragraph from the Fifth Canto also states that ätmäräma sages become fixed in single-minded devotion to Bhagavan: "O Lord, sages who delight in the Self alone inces- santly glorify Your attributes.

The word yādṛcchikatā, which means, "spontaneity," "independence," "accidentalness," or med "unexpectedness," has been interpreted differently according to how the different commentators read -(a)virodhi. In the present context, Jiva is arguing that the Kumāras were attracted to the Lord and that the use of the word anveṣaniya (to be sought out) in the above quote indicates that it was not accidental, or in other words, that it was purposeful. Nevertheless, this does not mean that they did so either with the deliberate intent to set an example for others, or out of previous habit. The fact that their attraction to the Lord's feet was purposeful does not contradict its spontaneity.

In the present narration also it was directly stated that the Lord bestowed joy upon the Kumāras: "You have manifested this charming form before us, and our eyes have achieved much bliss by seeing it."63 
अत्र पूर्वोक्तहेतोश्च स्तुतौ प्रत्युतोपालम्भप्रसङ्गाच् च “नेहावलोककलया हृदि संस्पृशन्तम्” (भा० ३ | १५ | ३९) इति साक्षादुक्तेश्च दृशामेव सुखं जातमित्यनासक्तिरेव व्यञ्जितेत्यपि न व्याख्येयम् । तस्मादात्मारामाणां रमणास्पदत्वाद् ब्रह्माख्यमात्मवस्त्वेव श्रीभगवान् । 
For the reasons given above, and because of the self-censure found in their prayers, and also from the direct statement, "The Lord touched their heart by His glances of affection" (SB 3.15.39),64 it should not be concluded that only the eyes of the Kumāras [and not the Kumāras themselves] felt bliss, and that this description thus indicates only their detachment from material life. There- fore, since He is the locus of pleasure even for those who delight in the self alone (ātmārama), the transcendental existent called Brahman is verily Śrī Bhagavan.

Moreover, since it was said, "He created a commotion even in the minds and bodies of the Brahman-realized Kumāras" (SB 3.15.43),65 it is understood that Bhagavan is the Absolute in its most highly condensed essence, more substantial even than Brahman. This is so because Bhagavan additionally grants the variegated bliss of seeing and being absorbed in His unsurpassed, beautiful bodily limbs and features. Because it cannot otherwise be accounted for, it is to be inferred that this wonderful bliss is also a manifestation of His svarupa-sakti.

Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī gives several references to prove that the Kumā- ras were completely free from the gunas of material nature and were continuously absorbed in the bliss of Brahman, so much so that they did not even care to wear a loincloth. Anger is a manifestation of the gunas of passion and ignorance, and it leads to the fortification of ignorance. Śrīdhara Svami therefore explains that their anger arose neither to teach common men a lesson, nor as a result of old impres- sions, but because of the supreme will of the Lord. Owing to the ele- vated state that the Kumāras were established in, it was not possible for them to be subject to anger. Śrī Kapila explains this: u bzol 
Chlupdy 
Because of establishment in his true identity (svarupa), the high-or 10 est liberated being does not even notice whether, due to the natu- deral course of events, the body he occupies is seated or standing, or whether it has moved to a different location or returned, just as per- son blinded by intoxication does not perceive whether the clothes that adorn his body are still present or not. (SB 3.28.37)66 
It is crystal clear from this description that the Kumāras became overwhelmingly drawn to the service of the Lord and considered the form of the Lord and the bliss of bhakti superior even to Brahman. Nevertheless, some proponents of Radical Nondualism may attempt to explain these verses in a way that contradicts the above obser- vations. Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmi presents some of their arguments and refutes them. 
B 
Those who propound the conception of the Absolute as formless may argue that the Kumāras did not become attached to the form of the Lord because of His beauty or mercy, and that the happiness the Kumāras derived from seeing the Lord was only an external pleasure for their eyes and did not touch or transform their hearts, as under- stood by the Vaisnavas. This argument has some apparent merit,

768 
79 The Threefold Spiritual Manifestation Is Part of the Internal Potency 
since the fact that a person may enjoy seeing beautiful scenery does not necessarily mean that he or she becomes attached to it, or gives up all previous conceptions of pleasure. 
Nevertheless, such an explanation is quite impertinent, because the Kumāras said in their prayers, "You are inducing love in them" (samprati ratim racayantam, SB 3.15.47). Love indicates a feeling of joy arising from the heart and not just from the eyes. Moreover, had the Kumāras not become attached to the Lord's service, they would not have prayed for their minds to be fixed on His feet, as they did in 
SB 3.15.49. 
The statement, "They experienced a commotion both in mind and in body, even though they were established in the bliss of the Imper- ishable" (Section 79.7), clearly shows that the Kumāras derived sub- stantial joy from the personal form of the Lord. Thus, the inference is that the Lord's personal form surpasses in completeness even the completion of unqualified Brahman. Since the Lord's body is tran- scendental, it should be understood that the bliss derived from see- ing Him surges from the internal potency and not from the gunas of

nature.

A Objection: Let us consider for a moment that the Kumāras' expe- rience of extreme bliss, upon witnessing the Lord's form, was simply a condensed manifestation of the bliss of unqualified being (nirvisesa-svarupa-ānanda), its density being due to the imposition on Brahman of certain distinguishing characteristics, known as upadhis. [According to this view, Bhagavan is Brah- man qualified with upadhis]. In other words, the Brahman that appears in the mind states (citta-vṛtti) that arise out of just a por- tion of pure being (viśuddha-sattva), also manifests in Bhagavan, 
769Pansio? IammanlaŚrī Bhagavat Sandarbha Allem 
who is condensed and undivided pure being (viśuddha-sattva). Then through superimposition (adhyasa) of Brahman as Bhaga- vän, the mind states are modified into exact conformity with Bhagavan, and so the Brahman that appears in the mind states, does so in qualified form. Hence, the statement that there is no difference between the Lord's form and Parabrahman is made only from the perspective that such a form acquires complete oneness with Brahman [in the citta-vrtti]. 
अत एव तत्र तत्रोपाधावेक एव निर्भेदपरमानन्दः समुपलभ्यते न तु विशेषाकारगन्धोऽपि । तत्तदुपाधेरपेक्षणं तु प्रतिपदतदानन्दसमाधिगतकौतुकनिबन्धनम् । तस्मात् कथमनेन प्रमाणेन तत्तदुपाधीनामपि परतत्त्वाकारत्वं साध्यत इति ? 
Therefore, in the various limiting adjuncts (upādhis), only one nondifferentiated supreme bliss is realized, without even a trace of any kind of form. These adjuncts are required only for the sake of providing interesting experiences in each arising moment in the bliss of trance. So, by this evidence how can you try to establish even these upadhis as forms of the Absolute Truth? g

Answer: According to your doctrine, the Supreme Brahman that manifests in the pure mind states (citta-vṛtti) is a complete man- ifestation, since it is agreed that brahma-vidya is established only by abandoning all trace of differentiation, because incom- plete jñāna is not accepted as the Absolute Truth, and because it is impossible to attain oneness by such incomplete knowledge. Therefore, it is improper to accept that Brahman has an extra manifestation in the Lord's form. Moreover, what is your inten- tion in claiming that the upadhis that characterize the Lord's forms, attributes and so on, are pure sattva in nature? Do you 
770 
79 The Threefold Spiritual Manifestation Is Part of the Internal Potency 
mean that they are transformations of pure sattva alone, or that they are replete with sattva [i.e., having a predominance of sattva]? The first option is not possible because, as was made clear earlier, there can be no transformation without rajo-guna. Nor is the second option possible, since by accepting that these forms are replete with sattva, it implies that they are manifesta- tions of mixed sattva, and so the word "pure" (viśuddha) would become meaningless in statements cited earlier such as, "You accept viśuddha-sattva for maintenance" (SB 10.2.34).67 
अस्तु वा विमिश्रत्वं तथापि तादृशे ब्रह्मस्फुरणयोग्यतैव न सम्भवेत् किं पुनर्विशेषेणेत्युद्दे- श्यविस्मृतिश्च स्यात् । 
Or, if it is granted that these upādhis are a mixture of the gunas, then they would not have the ability to bestow any kind of expe- rience of Brahman, what to speak of Brahman qualified by form. Those who put forth such ideas have forgotten the purpose of their own argument. 
अथाखण्डविशुद्धसत्त्वाश्रयत्वेन तेऽपि तद्रूपतयैवोच्यन्ते । ततश्च ते स्वनुभूताखण्डशुद्धस- त्त्वे तस्मिन् ब्रह्मानुभवन्तीति चेत् । तदयुक्तं कल्पनागौरवात् “तेऽचक्षताक्षविषयं स्वसमा- धिभाग्यम्” इति साक्षादेव गोचरीकृतत्वेनोक्ततया परम्परादृष्टत्वप्रतिघाताच्च । 
Now these upadhis, being supported by undifferentiated viśuddha- sattva, are also said to be of the same nature. So, if it is claimed that the Kumāras experienced Brahman through the Lord's form of undifferentiated viśuddha-sattva, a state of being they had already previously realized, this also is inappropriate, because it is marred by the defect of cumbrous assumption (kalpana- gaurava), or in other words the needless multiplication of causes. Moreover, the Kumāras directly saw the Lord, as was stated, "The fulfillment of their trance became apparent to their eyes" (SB 3.15.38).68 This contradicts the idea that they saw Him through a succession of causes or upadhis. 
तस्मात् तस्य शुद्धसत्त्वस्य प्राकृतत्वं तु निषिद्धमेव । तस्मान् न ते प्राकृतसत्त्वपरिणामः । न वा तत्प्रचुराः किन्तु स्वप्रकाशतालक्षणशुद्धसत्त्वप्रकाशिता इति प्राक्तनमेवोक्तं व्यक्तम् ।

In this way, it is completely refuted that there can be any material influence in the state of suddha-sattva. So, the Lord's forms are neither a transformation of material sattva, nor are they replete with it. Rather, they are manifestations of the suddha-sattva, in which self-luminosity is an inherent characteristic. This was stated earlier and has been further clarified here.gs 
अत एव तेषामुपाधित्वनिराकृतेस्तत्तदनुभवानन्दवैचित्री च सम्पद्यते । 
When the suggestion that the Lord's forms are a product of upãd- his is negated, it naturally follows that the Kumāras experienced wonderful bliss by witnessing the Lord's form. 
तथैव तमेवमेवम्भूतम् अचक्षत इति तत्तद्विषयसौन्दर्यवर्णनं प्रस्तुतोपकारित्वात् सार्थकं स्यात् । अखण्डशुद्धसत्त्वमयमात्रेणैवाभिप्रेतसिद्धेः । अत एव "निरीक्ष्य च न वितृप्तदृशः " इति दृक्सम्बन्धित्वाद् रूपकृतैवातृप्तिरुक्ता । 
Similarly, when the Lord's form and qualities are understood in this way, the Kumāras' direct vision of Bhagavan and His beauty, as described in this section, becomes meaningful, because it con- firms the overall topic under discussion, the intention of which can be satisfied only if Bhagavan's form is constituted of undif- ferentiated pure sattva. So, the statement, "Their eyes were not satiated by seeing His form" [SB 3.15.42], since it was made in rela- tion to the Kumāras' sense of sight, shows that their unsatedness was caused [objectively] by the Lord's form.

Similarly, by the specific words akṣara-juṣām api, "although situ- ated in the bliss of the Imperishable," used here, it is shown that the Lord's specific qualities, namely the aroma from His lotus feet, were able to surpass [the bliss of] Imperishable Brahman. Other- wise, if in both instances [both in the experience of the Imperish- able and that of Bhagavan], they had experienced only the bliss of Brahman without attributes, [then both experiences would have been identical, and it would be impossible for one to surpass the

other]. In that case, instead of akṣara-juṣām api, it would have been necessary to say, "although situated in knowledge" (vidya- juṣām api), so that upadhis would then become the focus of the comparison. In that case, [instead of comparing two degrees of completion of the Absolute, i.e., Brahman and Bhagavan] the com- parison would be reduced to no more than the mutual contention between the upadhi of knowledge and the upadhi of form.

By stating that the bliss of beholding the Lord's form defeats that of Brahman realization, it is precluded that the Kumāras' absorp- tion in the Lord's form was a mere semblance, like the great sage Vasistha's behavior of mourning for his sons. And so Śrīdhara Svāmī commented, "This verse demonstrates that the bliss of unalloyed service and relation in devotional love (bhajanananda) is superior to the bliss of mere abidance in one's original state of unqualified being (svarupananda)."69 di tossed by

Therefore, variegatedness also exists in the Lord. For this reason, the Kumāras took account of this variety in their prayers, when they said, "only if our minds can take pleasure, like bees, in Your lotus feet [...]," [SB 3.15.49]. If the bliss of Brahman experienced by the Kumāras were topmost, to search for any special bliss in mere upādhis would have been pointless. After all, "If honey is avail- able in the kitchen corner, why hunt for it in the mountains?"" Nor did they have any interest in seeking out anything material.

It is therefore impossible to claim that this happiness [if based on the experience of upãdhis] is of another kind [namely tran- scendental bliss], since the upadhis produced by maya are base by nature, and because of the apparent existence of elements in that happiness [i.e., in the upadhis themselves] that must be rejected. Thus, by the process of elimination, it must be acknowledged that these features [i.e., the Lord's forms] are manifestations of svarupa-śakti.

A further objection is proposed by the Advaitavadi interpreters: They admit that the pleasure derived by the Kumāras was certainly superior to brahmananda, but that it resulted from concentrated Brahman (i.e., the form of the Lord) and not from anything other than Brahman, such as the svarupa-sakti of the Lord. They say that just as Brahman is experienced in the pure heart, the form of the Lord, which is nothing but solidified Brahman, can also be experi- enced in the pure heart. The extra pleasure derived is due to the upadhi present in the concentrated form.

There is no actual difference between water and ice, but in cer- tain circumstances, like in the heat of summer, ice gives more plea- sure. Similarly, there is no difference between Brahman and the Lord, but His personal form may sometimes appear more attractive. Let However, water becomes solid owing to the upadhi of coolness - it is not its natural state. Similarly, when a jñāni has a soft heart, Brahman appears to him in a personal form, but the ultimate reality remains as unqualified Brahman. This, the Advaitavādīs claim, is the significance of the scriptural statements that propound the identity of Brahman and Bhagavan. This explanation has the beauty of philo- sophical brevity: there is no need to accept any complicating factor or extra item, like the svarupa-sakti. 
20 In response, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī says that it is impossible for Brahman to manifest as Bhagavan with the help of upadhis. The question is, "What is an upadhi?" Jiva says that according to the Advaitavada doctrine, an upadhi, or limiting adjunct, can be either a modification of suddha-sattva or be replete with sattva. Of course, for Advaitavādīs, it goes without saying that this sattva is material. 
However, according to Sankhya as well as Vedanta, no modifi- cation is possible without rajo-guna. Therefore, upadhis cannot be transformations of pure sattva-guna, because there is no rajo-guna present in pure sattva to bring about a transformation, and because the sattva of which the upadhi is constituted would, in any case, no longer be pure. Similarly, the upadhis could not simply have an abun- dance of sattva, because it has been proven that the Lord's form is śuddha-sattva and free from any mixture of the gunas. Abundance would indicate a predominance of sattva, but would still allow for a mixture with the other gunas, rajas and tamas. In that case, the adjec- tive "pure" (viśuddha) would be devoid of sense. Moreover, if it were to be accepted that upadhis arise from an abundance of sattva, then it cannot apply to Brahman, as Brahman is completely free from rajas and tamas. Were this the case, there would be no possibility of the Kumāras experiencing bliss and certainly no experience of anything beyond that, because the Kumāras were fixed in Brahman. 
In answer, Advaitavādīs might say that the Kumāras experienced Brahman in viśuddha-sattva while seeing the form made of upādhis.

This is certainly a very cumbersome explanation. Moreover, it is to be noted that these arguments are given assuming śuddha-sattva to be material sattva, free from passion and ignorance. But this is impossible, as the gunas are always mixed, as was shown in Anu- ccheda 13. Thus, there is no possibility of the guna of pure material goodness. When the scriptures say that the Lord's body is made of viśuddha-sattva, or pure goodness, this does not mean that it is con- stituted of material goodness, but of the transcendental cit potency or vasudeva-tattva. 
The Advaitavādīs also claim that, just as Vasistha's lamentation over the demise of his sons was not real, so the attraction of the Kumāras to the Lord's form was not real. The story of Vasistha is described in Mahabharata. His one hundred sons were eaten by King Kalamāṣapāda, who had been possessed by a demonic Kinkara by the arrangement of Visvamitra. Vasistha was overcome by grief and tried to commit suicide many times, but failed. The Advaitavādīs say that since Vasistha was Brahman-realized, his grief could not have been real. Similarly, the attraction of the Kumāras to the Lord's form could not be real, since Brahman-realized beings are beyond attachment, lamentation and delusion.ow ding sproti 
This explanation certainly contradicts the direct experience of the Kumāras. They prayed that their minds remain attached to the Lord's lotus feet, just as a bumblebee is to flowers. If the Lord's form had been only a product of upādhis, they would not have prayed in this manner, as they had no attraction to material objects. Their prayers do not indicate that they experienced impersonal realiza- tion by seeing the Lord. Were it so, they would not bow down before Him and pray for devotion. Obeisances are offered only when one considers oneself distinct from and inferior to the object of worship.

Furthermore, let us acknowledge for a moment the view that it is specifically in the state of "living liberation" (jivan-mukti) that the Lord's form, which is reflected in the upadhi of knowledge, is more densely luminous than Brahman. Yet statements, such as, "[they] do not regard even ultimate liberation as Your mercy"" explicitly reveal that even in the state of final liberation [known as videha-mukti or liberation from embodied existence], which is completely free from all upädhis, the Lord's form is considered superior. 
अत एव यः कश्चिदपि जल्पति - ज्ञानाकारायां प्रेमाकारायां च चित्तवृत्तौ ब्रह्म प्रकाशते तत्र तूत्तरस्यामुपाधिवैशिष्ट्यात् प्रकाशवैशिष्ट्यमित्यत्रैव पुरुषार्थसारत्वं तत्र तत्रोच्यत इति तदपि स्वयमेव बहिष्कृतम् । तस्मान् नोपाधितारतम्यचिन्ता “भवतः कथायाः" इत्यनेन निरुपाधिब्रह्मभूयादुपरि च वैचित्री स्फुटमेवासौ स्वीकृता । 
[From this it must be concluded that the superiority of the Lord's form cannot at all be accounted for on the basis of upādhis.] There- fore, if someone makes the absurd claim that Brahman appears both in the mind states shaped by knowledge and in those shaped by love, but that the latter manifestation is superior due to the superiority of the upadhi, which is the same reason why scrip- tures sometimes refer to prema as the essence of human goals, such claims are inherently without validity. Consequently, there is no question of a gradation in the upadhis. In SB 3.15.48, diversity existing beyond the upadhi-free state of Brahman realization has clearly been accepted.

Commentary

In this section, Jiva examines a line of argument put forth by the Advaitavada interpreters. They claim that it is only in the state of living liberation (jivan-mukta) that Bhagavan is perceived as con- densed Brahman, because He is a manifestation of Brahman in the upadhi of vidya (knowledge). When one gives up the body, however, and realizes himself to be Brahman, there is no such pronounced attraction for Bhagavan. The Kumāras were certainly jīvan-muktas; thus, it was possible for them to be attracted to the Lord. au 
This argument is soundly defeated by the Kumāras' statement that they do not consider ultimate liberation as the mercy of the Lord (natyantikam viganayanty api te prasādam, SB 3.15.48). They consider bhakti as the only real mercy of the Lord. They are willing to suffer in hell, but do not care for impersonal liberation.

IPEŚrī Jīva Prabhu counters yet another argument presented by the Advaitavādīs: Brahman manifests in the pure heart when it is imbued either with love (premākāra) or with knowledge (vidyākāra). This position is presented by Śri Madhusudana Sarasvati, who 
writes: 
When the heart melts and the mind is molded into the shape of the Lord, that determinate state of mind is called bhakti. But when one the experiences nondual Brahman without the melting of the heart, that indeterminate state of mind is called brahma-vidya. (Śri-bhagavad- bhakti-rasayana 1.1, Svopajña-ṭīkā) 80 
The import is that the one Brahman appears differently in the hearts of different people, with and without upadhis. 
Such a proposal is refuted by the earlier categorical repudia- tion of upadhis as a basis for Bhagavan realization. This definition of bhakti is purely a mental speculation and not supported by any scripture. 
Bhagavan realization is not a change in the material mind, nor is bhakti a particular mental state. Śrī Kṛṣṇa says that mental states (citta-vṛttis) are modifications in the material body (GĪTĀ 13.7). On the other hand, bhakti is devoid of all upadhis: 
Bhakti is unalloyed service to the Lord and master of the senses, conducted through the medium of the senses, which is free from all types of upadhis, and devoid of all impurity, through complete hodedication to Him. (Narada-pañcaratra, quoted in BRS 1.1.11)81 tenblum nov 
Thus, it is clear from the prayers of the Kumāras that the Lord is inherently self-endowed with internal potency, and the bliss experienced from that internal potency is superior to brahma- nanda. Śrī Sarvajña Muni, a prominent teacher in the line of Sankarācārya, thus wrote in his commentary on Nrsimha-tapani

Upanisad, "Liberated beings also take suitable forms to worship the Lord."82 
Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī concludes with a number of quotations to show that even liberated persons take pleasure in devotional service to Bhagavan.

section:

८० । अत एवाशेषपुरुषार्थस्वरूप एवासाविति स्फुटमेवाहुर्गद्येन (भा० ५।३।७-८ ) - 
IN THE FOLLOWING PROSE PASSAGE, the Ṛtviks clearly stated to Lord Yajñapuruşa that the Lord is the personification of all human attainments (puruşartha): 
अथानयापि न भवत इज्ययोरुभारभरया समुचितमर्थमिहोपलभामहे ।। ३८१ ।। आत्मन एवानुसवनमञ्जसा व्यतिरेकेण बोभूयमानाशेषपुरुषार्थस्वरूपस्य || 
३८२ ॥ 
Therefore, we do not perceive that even this grandiose worship serves any beneficial purpose for You. By Your constitutional nature, You are at every moment, directly and indirectly, and to an abundant extent, the embodiment of the supreme goal of unlimited human pursuits [...]. (SB 5.3.7-8) 
टीका च - आत्मनः स्वत एवानुसवनं सर्वदा अञ्जसा साक्षाद् बोभूयमाना अतिशयेन भवन्तो ये अशेषाः पुरुषार्थास्ते स्वरूपं यस्य परमानन्दस्य । इत्येषा । श्रुतिश्च “सर्वकामः सर्वगन्धः सर्वरसः” (छा० ३ । १४ । २) इत्यादौ । ऋत्विगादयः श्रीयज्ञपुरुषम् ॥ 
Śrīdhara Svāmi comments: "The unlimited goals of human exis- tence, which abound in and of themselves, at every moment, both directly and indirectly, are the embodiment of Him, the Supreme Bliss." The Śruti declares, "He is the embodiment of all desires, all fragrances and all tastes [...]" (CHU 3.14.2).

Commentary to you 
dw nieso 
tund at adaos mun fardhosmibody AFTER EXPLAINING that the Lord's form, abode, attributes, asso- ciates and actions are manifestations of His svarupa-sakti, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi concludes that He is the personification of all human pur- suits. Everyone, in whatever they pursue, is searching for Him only, either directly or indirectly, as Śrī Kṛṣṇa says in GĪTĀ 4.11, "Everyone follows My path in all respects, O son of Pṛtha." 
Mon 
But the Lord has no need to seek out or follow anyone. This means that He is perfect in and of Himself. He does not depend on anything or anyone, but as the personification of all goals, others necessarily depend on Him. This also implies that He is completely transcenden- tal and blissful in nature; otherwise, He could neither be the person- ification of all goals nor independent. Everyone is ultimately search- ing for happiness or loving reciprocation. The essence of all goals is bliss or love, and thus He is the personification of bliss. 
To substantiate this, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī cites a prose passage from the prayers of King Nabhi's sacrificial priests. The king had no progeny and worshiped Lord Yajñapuruşa with the hope of obtain- ing a son. The Vedas prescribe different sacrifices to attain different goals. Because the Lord is the personification of all goals, He grants them to His worshipers. The Lord was pleased with Nabhi's sacrifice and appeared in the sacrificial arena to offer benediction. At that time the priests recited prayers to the Lord. 
Since the Lord appeared in the sacrifice upon being satisfied, one may contend that He derived pleasure from the sacrifice, implying that He was lacking it beforehand. This doubt is dispelled by the priests who say that it was the king and not the Lord who had a purpose to achieve. The Lord simply appeared out of His causeless mercy to bless the king. Being independent and fully satisfied does not mean being indifferent, rigid or hard-hearted. 
Chandogya Upanisad says that the Lord is the embodiment of all tastes, desires, fragrances and so on. This shows He does not lack anything - that He is complete. When the words sarva-kāma (all desires) are used in reference to the Lord, it does not mean that He has base desires. In GĪTĀ 7.11, Śrī Kṛṣṇa says, "O Arjuna, I am that 
783 
Śrī Bhagavat Sandarbha 
desire which is not opposed to the way of truth." Kṛṣṇa is not the embodiment of desire that runs counter to truth. 
In the same context, Kṛṣṇa also says, "I am the fragrance of the earth" (punyo gandhaḥ prthivyam ca). According to Amara- kośa 3.3.160, punya means beautiful. Thus, the Lord is not the stench. Consequently, sarva must be taken to mean all with the exception of the detestable. Arloni 
In various places in Bhagavad Gita, Kṛṣṇa speaks about His opu- lences in the material world. They are the best of its qualities, objects or people. Actually, His taste, desire, fragrance and so on, are tran- scendental. As far as the Lord is concerned, even the good qualities in this material world have defects. Otherwise, He would be the per- sonification of all good material qualities. But that would contra- dict the statement of the priests that He is the personification of all goals - puruṣārtha-svarupa. 
Material good qualities are not absolute in nature. For example, the taste or fragrance that human beings enjoy are not the same for a pig, and vice versa. It was earlier explained that the Lord's qualities are all transcendental. But the Lord's qualities are absolute, which means that they are satisfactory to all beings, humans as well as pigs. 210 In the next anuccheda, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi will once again explain that one Absolute Reality manifests in three ways and that, of the three, Bhagavan is the most complete manifestation.

IN THIS WAY, even though it has been clearly shown with mul- tiple references to the testimony of realized sages that the most complete manifestation of Brahman is in Bhagavan, this matter shall here be considered again in further detail. The one Absolute Truth is described in two ways, but there is no difference in its essence, even though a difference exists not only in name, but in appearance also. However, two types of eligible seekers, accord- ing to their individual perceptual abilities, see the one Absolute in these two ways and worship Him accordingly.

One should not misconstrue that the realization of one is factual while the other is delusive, because the reality of both [manifes- tations] has been established.

These are the two different manifestations [of the one Absolute].

This being the case, when the substantive appears without attributes, that vision is incomplete, as when it appears in the form of Brahman. And when that substantive manifests in a form with attributes that demonstrate the varieties inherent in its essential nature, then that vision is complete, as when it appears in the form of Sri Bhagavān.

Commentary - Frid 
AFTER ANALYZING the experience of the Kumāras and proving that Bhagavan is the complete manifestation of the Absolute, inclusive of, and superior to, Brahman, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi further fortifies his conclusions. This is called applying the logic of driving in a post, or sthūņa-nikhanana-nyaya. To drive a post or peg into the ground, one must hammer it again and again. The more it is ham- mered, the more firmly it stands. Because the Brahman doctrine 
786 
81 Bhagavan Is the Most Complete Manifestation of Brahman 
was very prominent at the time Sat Sandarbhas were written, Śrila Jiva Gosvāmi endeavors meticulously to establish Bhagavan as the complete Absolute. To naidi sila ni all soft agnads 
He wants to leave no room for doubt in the mind of his reader. The more firmly he establishes the transcendental and nondual nature of Bhagavan, the weaker becomes the Brahmavādī's inher- ently limiting claim that the Absolute must be without variety or distinction in order to preserve its nonduality. Such a position obliges the Absolute to conform to conventional laws of rationality and thus totally fails to accommodate the possibility of transcenden- tal variety. Bhagavan is inclusive of such transcendental variety, without in any way compromising His nondual essence, and the fact that He does so is beyond logic (acintya-bheda-abheda).shamonix dao In this anuccheda, Śrī Jiva Prabhu again explains the concept of advaya-tattva or nondual reality. In Tattva Sandarbha, he concluded that this advaya-tattva is the subject of Srimad Bhagavatam. In the first section of this Bhagavat Sandarbha, he began by saying that the one Absolute Reality manifests in three ways, as Brahman, Param- ātmā and Bhagavan, according to the qualification of the worshiper. 
Now, Śrī Jiva discusses the Absolute in reference to Brahman and Bhagavan. Earlier he said that if Bhagavan is understood, being the more inclusive Reality, then Brahman is automatically revealed (See Anuccheda 7). This does not imply the converse, however, that Brahman-realization is the same as knowing Bhagavan. Both are dis- tinct, and the difference is not in name alone, but in the way the Absolute appears to the worshiper. 
Furthermore, it is not that the realization of one aspect is fac- tual and the other imaginary. When the Kumāras saw the Supreme Lord in Vaikuntha, they did not conclude that Brahman was unreal, but they understood that Brahman was of the nature of Bhagavan and that devotional service to Him resulted in a more complete realization of the Absolute. 
It is also incorrect to think that one manifestation of the Abso- lute is a transformation or effect of one of the other manifestations.

In other words, it is not that Bhagavan transforms into Brahman or vice versa. Both are the One Absolute Reality and are not subject to change. The difference lies in the vision of the experiencer. When Reality manifests without attributes, it is called Brahman. One who realizes this aspect as the Ultimate Reality has incomplete realiza- tion. When the Absolute manifests with attributes, He is called Bhagavan, and one who realizes Him in this way has complete real- ization. Mathematically speaking, Bhagavan is the superset and Brahman its subset. 
An example would be that of the sun and sunshine. One who can see only the rays of sunshine coming in through the window has a partial realization of the sun. One who sees the sun orb, however, automatically sees the sunshine as well. His realization is more com- plete. But one who sees the Sun God within the orb has the most complete vision.

Commentary 
किलि 
fians Epher 
To prove that gradations exist in the realization of the Absolute Truth, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī alludes to the appearance of Srimad Bhaga- vatam, which is narrated in the First Canto. Sūta Gosvāmī explained to Saunaka Rsi how, after compiling the four Vedas and compos- ing the Purānas, Mahabharata and Vedanta-sutra, Vyasadeva's mind was still not satisfied. He had realized Brahman and explained it in Brahma-sutra, and yet he was still filled with lamentation. He admitted to Narada Muni that, despite compiling Mahabharata for the welfare of those who are not eligible to study the Vedas, he felt as though he had something left to accomplish. 
Narada Muni asked him the cause of his dejection. This ques- tion itself indicates that Brahman realization is not the ultimate in transcendence, and does not offer the highest fulfillment. Nārada addresses Śrīla Vyasa as "master" (prabhu) in recognition of his achievements, for he had thoroughly studied and experienced Brah- man. In spite of this, the fact that he felt unfulfilled indicates that Brahman realization is incomplete in comparison to that of Bhagavan.

man's mind to the Lord, but the Lord's pastimes do not appear promi- nently among the various other parables and histories that Vyasa 
told. Vidura 
ora stated the same thing to Maitreya: 
be to ybune 97 ES DUERO duond Your friend, the sage Kṛṣṇa [Vyasa], has spoken the Mahabharatad 220 with the intention of describing the Lord's qualities. In Mahab- 
hārata, he captured people's minds by telling them pleasurable sto-w ries of a mundane nature, in order to draw them towards Hari-katha. (SB 3.5.12) 
This verse indicates that Śrī Vyasa had to discuss many mundane topics (gramya-sukhanuvada) to entice materialistic people to listen to the Lord's pastimes. People in general are interested in sense pleasure and liberation (bhukti and mukti). It is extremely rare to find a person who is interested in hearing about the Lord's pastimes without any ulterior motives. 
The ultimate test of any wisdom teaching is whether it is ful- filling to the true self. Since Śrī Vyasa himself was not satisfied with his work, how would others be satisfied? Sense gratification. can only grant flickering pleasure. Lasting satisfaction comes only through devotion, yayātmā samprasidati (SB 1.2.6). Narada Muni indicates that glorification of the Lord, which includes all the limbs of devotional service, is superior to the culture of brahma-jñāna. This naturally means that Bhagavan realization is the most perfect and complete realization. The remainder of Śrī Narada's answer elab- orates this theme. So as not to increase the size of the book, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi quickly states the conclusion without citing all the verses. For a detailed understanding, one should study the complete chapter 5 of the First Canto of Śrīmad Bhagavatam.

Śridhara Svāmi comments: "The word nişkarma (devoid of action or the consequences of action) means Brahman; and the jñāna that is characterized by freedom from bondage to karma, because it is of the same nature as Brahman, is known as naiskarmya (lib- eration). The word añjana (lit., tincture) is that by which one is colored or corrupted. It is used here in the sense of upadhi or an artificial designation of the self. The jñāna that eliminates all such artificial designations is known as nirañjana. Even this type of jñāna is without beauty, if devoid of devotion to the infallible Lord. This means that it cannot give complete and direct appre- hension of the Truth that lies beyond the purview of the senses.

"This being the case, how can karma have any beauty in it, if unoffered to the Lord? The adverb śaśvat (always), qualifying the word abhadra (inauspicious), means that kamya-karma (goal- oriented action) is always inauspicious, both in the stage of prac- tice and upon achieving the result.

Commentary

In this verse, Narada Muni discredits knowledge devoid of devo- tional service. Acyuta-bhāva means bhakti. Even knowledge that is completely devoid of sense gratification, material attachment or envy (niranjana-jñāna) is incomplete. Moreover, since Brahman is all-pervading, there are no actions in it, and thus it is called nişkarma. So the knowledge of oneness with Brahman is also called naişkarmya- jñāna.dnotovah to blovs 
Even unmotivated knowledge is not beautiful - na śobhate - as it cannot give perfect realization of the Absolute. It is like a servant who has knowledge of his master, but renders no practical service. This certainly will not please the master, nor will he open himself up to or even take care of such a servant, who in the final analysis will surely remain distressed. 
If such is the case with knowledge, then certainly fruitive action (kamya-karma) can never satisfy the self, for it is miserable from beginning to end. There are many rules and regulations that must be meticulously observed to achieve the result of kamya-karma, and most such endeavors end in defeat. The examples of King Anga acquiring the evil-natured Vena as a son through sacrifice, and Tvaṣṭā creating Vṛtrasura to kill Indra, are prominent. Even if one achieves the desired result, he will not be satisfied because his

Sense desires are never quietened through sense enjoyment, rather they are intensified all the more, just as pouring ghee on a fire only causes it to flame up more and more. (SB 9.19.14) 10

and to see Śrī Bhagavat Sandarbha 
Mantra-murti (having mantra form) means either having the inherent forms invoked in the mantra, or that the mantra itself is also a form of His. Amurtika (who has no material form) means who has no form other than the one stated in the mantra, or who is without any material form. Alternatively, since the Lord's form (murti) is nondifferent from His svarupa, amurtika simply means that the Lord's form (murti) does not exist separate from Him, as is the case with material objects [such as a statue of a per- son]. The person who worships the Lord with this understand- ing is awarded complete vision, because the complete Absolute, Bhagavan, is the sole cause of His own complete self-revelation. 
Commentary 
In the next two verses, Śrī Nārada explains the process of bhakti. He says that one can attain complete vision (samyag-darśana) by the process of chanting the Lord's names, which is indicative of other limbs of bhakti. Earlier he said that any system without bhakti is incomplete (khila). As such, bhakti is naturally the complete darśana. Mantra-murti means that the Lord's form is described in the mantra, and by chanting, one can realize it. It has already been established that the mantra that contains the name of the Lord is not material. Amurtika means that the Lord does not have a material form. Conse- quently, the deity forms of the Lord, such as those established in tem- ples for the purpose of worship, are not material objects like statues but nondifferent from Bhagavan. 
Another significant and practical point to be gleaned from the dialogue between Śrī Vyasa and Narada is that one cannot come to perfect realization of Bhagavan without the mercy of a spiritual teacher. Even a person like Vyasa, who was learned both in kamya- karma (Brahman as immanence in the form of fruitive action) and brahma-jñāna (Brahman as transcendence), could not solve his prob- lem. Therefore, Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī advises that one should take shelter of a genuine guru, receive initiation and study under him: "Therefore, one should take shelter of a true guru, receive initiation from him in kṛṣṇa-mantra and then study under him. One should 
796 
81 Bhagavan Is the Most Complete Manifestation of Brahman 
render service respectfully to one's guru and follow in the footsteps of the saintly" (BRS 1.2.74)12 
Śrī Nārada described the Lord as mantra-murti, or one whose form is invoked in the mantra. But this mantra must be received from a genuine guru, otherwise it will not be effective. If the above process is undertaken, one will be awakened to samyag-darśana, or complete vision of the Absolute. 
In the following anuccheda, Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmi will continue to show that Bhagavan exhibits the highest degree of completion, including yet transcending Brahman, on the basis of the former's attractive qualities.

IN THIS WAY, it has been shown that the degree of completion in the manifestation of the Absolute is determined by the com- pleteness of the vision of the worshiper. On this basis, it has been established that Bhagavan exceeds Brahman in completion and inclusivity. This will now be further discussed through other indicators. Śrī Sūta Gosvāmi described the completeness of Bha- gavan on account of the excellence of one specific quality, namely His ability to captivate the attention even of an ātmārāma, a liberated being, who delights in the self alone:

Alternatively, grantha means 'the knots of attachment' (granthi), and nirgrantha means 'whose knots of attachment have been severed.'

"A doubt is raised, 'But why do such liberated beings perform devotional service?' To answer all such doubts once and for all, Śrī Sūta said, 'Indeed, such are the qualities of the Lord" (ittham- bhūta-guna). Here ends Śrīdhara Svāmi's comment. 
Commentary 
IN THE PREVIOUS SECTION, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī supported his expla- nation that Bhagavan is superior to Brahman by describing the his- tory of the appearance of Srimad Bhagavatam. In fact, Srimad Bha- gavatam appeared specifically to prove this point. This is evident from the experience of Śrīla Vyasa, as described in the previous anuccheda. This being the case, one can expect many such histo- ries in Bhagavatam. In this anuccheda, the author refers to one such episode. 
Vyasa's son, Sukadeva Gosvāmi, who is the prime speaker of Śrī- mad Bhagavatam, also experienced that Bhagavan is the most com- plete manifestation of the Absolute. He was a Brahman-realized being even before his birth, whose story is described in Tattva Sandarbha, Anuccheda 29.

It is said that Suka remained in the womb for many years because he had no desire to come out and face the distractions that might take him away from his absorption in Brahman realization.

He knew well from his own experience that his son did not yet have the highest realization of the Absolute. Every parent desires to offer the best to his children; thus, Vyasadeva wanted to teach Śrimad Bhagavatam to Suka so that he would take to devotional service. With this intent he followed him, calling him to come back. But Suka paid him no heed.

Bhagavatam describes just how far beyond material dualities he

But they had not done so previously when his son had passed by. Noticing this curious behavior, the sage inquired as to the reason, and the young ladies replied, "You still maintain a dis- tinction between male and female, but your son has no such duality of vision." (SB 1.4.5)2 
Understanding the depth of Sukadeva's spiritual awareness, Śau- naka Ṛși was curious to know why he had gone on to study Śrīmad Bhāgavatam. Śrī Sūta Gosvāmī answered by reciting the principal verse of this section, which explains that the Lord's qualities are such that they attract even Brahman-realized beings, or ātmārāmas, whose attention cannot be diverted from unbroken absorption in the Self. For their attention to be drawn to Bhagavan is possible only if His qualities are transcendental and more highly captivating than Brahman.ga

Nirgrantha means, "a person who, having attained the goal of the scriptures, has transcended the binding injunctions (grantha) of scripture." Such a person no longer has any purpose to attain by fol- lowing or flouting scriptural injunctions. Thus, they are called nir- grantha (free from granthas). Alternatively, granthi means "knot,"

and thus nirgrantha also refers to one whose heart is free from the knot of ego, or in other words, a liberated being. Knots in the heart refer to the false identification of the self with the body-mind, and claiming the extensions of the body as one's own. The word "knot" may also refer to the knots in the sacred thread and in the kaupina (the loincloth). So in this case, nirgrantha could mean an avadhuta like Sukadeva, who did not bother to adorn himself even with a sacred thread or kaupina. dal poississЯ švagada 
If a liberated being is without extraneous desire, why would he engage in the service of the Lord? In answer to all such doubts, Śrī Sūta Gosvāmī said, itthambhūta-guno hariḥ - "Indeed, such are the qualities of Sri Hari." An ordinary person acts because he has desires to fulfill, but a liberated being serves the Lord with no such personal motives. His heart is forcibly captivated by the Lord. To signify this, Sūta Gosvāmī used the name Hari, or one who steals the hearts even of those whose hearts have been extinguished in Brahman. This proves the superiority of Bhagavan over Brahman.bruswor 
Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahaprabhu, who is Śrī Kṛṣṇa in the guise of a devotee, gave sixty-one explanations of this verse to Śrīla Sanatana Gosvāmi, uncle of the author. In those explanations, He showed how Śrī Hari has the power to attract everyone.

83 Bhagavan Realization Is the Highest Rung on the Ladder of Transcendence 
Commentary Bass boy boxitary 
IN THIS SECTION, Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmi demonstrates Bhagavan's supe- riority over Brahman by explaining the various levels of realization of a devotee. He shows that devotees who follow the path of jñāna- miśra-bhakti, or devotion mixed with knowledge, attain Bhagavan after realizing Brahman. 
Every devotee who has realized Bhagavan is naturally endowed with brahma-jñāna, just as a person having a million dollars automat- ically has one cent. Pure devotees, however, attain Brahman real- ization without consciously striving for it through adherence to the rules of the jñāna-marga. Therefore, their Brahman realization is momentary, which is to say that it is subsumed within the more com- prehensive realization of Bhagavan. Because they have no particular interest in Brahman per se, they do not linger upon it. When a stack of paper is stapled, each sheet is actually pierced individually, but it happens so quickly that it appears to happen simultaneously. This is called the śata-patra-bhedana-nyaya. 
Traversing the different stages of mixed devotion on the way to full God realization is compared to the passing of the staple through a stack of paper one sheet at a time. From this perspective, one can see that the stapling occurs gradually. Śrila Jiva Gosvāmī cites this nyaya to account for gradual upliftment and to show that since Bhagavan realization occurs after Brahman realization, the former is superior. He also shows that Brahman realization cannot be attained without devotional service. This further proves the superiority of Bhagavan over Brahman. 
Śrī Brahma ordered Prajapati Kardama Muni to perform penance and create progeny, so Kardama married the daughter of Svayamb- huva Manu, Śrīmati Devahūti. Śri Kapila, who propounded the Sankhya philosophy, appeared as their son. Śrī Kapila ordered Kar- dama to renounce everything and apply himself to realization of the self (SB 3.24.38).. 
Kardama followed His instructions and left home. The five verses cited in this section explain his gradual progress to bhagavati gatiḥ, or attainment of the Lord's feet. These verses describe that he first

from the associated feelings of possessiveness (nirmama). When these two patterns are absent, even the mind recedes into absence. The phrase "the vision of equanimity" (sama-drk) means non- apprehension of difference. "Witnessing his true self" (sva-drk) means he saw Brahman as nondifferent from his essential self.

Commentary 
When Kardama Muni realized Brahman, he became completely free from material ego and consequently free from the concept of "my- ness." My-ness subsists on I-ness. This means that his subtle body was dissolved. Ahankara, or material ego, is the knot that binds the living entity to matter. When one is Brahman-realized, he does not identify himself with the body and things related to it, but considers himself one with Brahman. Therefore, he is freed from duality and becomes equipoised. Nothing can disturb him anymore. 
Just as material ego exists in the conditioned state, real ego, or in other words, real "I-awareness," exists in the post-liberated state of devotion. Just as in the conditioned state one cannot be a doer without the ego of being an agent, similarly on the liberated platform one cannot engage in service without a suitable self-identity in rela- tion to Bhagavan. Because Kardama practiced devotion and did not consider Brahman his ultimate goal, he transcended Brahman and attained a transcendental "I-awareness" and mind. At that time he saw the Lord in everything and everything in the Lord. At this stage there is no further bondage. alb snow ug sa has butar og lei 
Transcendental self-concept and mind bind one to the Lord, just as the material ego binds one to matter. Impersonalists are afraid of ego, but they do not know that pure I-awareness is transcendental and that it liberates a devotee eternally. Once a devotee has attained this state, he is never bound to the material ego.

The import is that after his mate- rial ego, mind and so on were dissolved, as a result of brahma- jñāna, he attained their post-liberated counterparts, which are of the nature of unalloyed being (viśuddha-sattva), and one in essence and constitution with the bliss of love.

This is not the case, because it is said that the transcendental self- identity emerges in the state of freedom from all bondage (mukta- bandhana). This principle is stated in Brahma-sutra, "The scrip- tures declare that a liberated being never returns to material consciousness" (anāvṛttiḥ śabdāt, vs 4.4.22). 
Commentary

In the Bhāgavatam verse cited here, the word labdhātmā is signifi- cant. It means that when a practicing devotee attains perfection, he becomes detached from the material ego and attains a spiritual ego, or in other words, a transcendental self-identity in relation to Bhagavan, the complete Whole, of which he is a conscious, inte- grated part. Just as in the materially conditioned state, a person has a material body and senses, the perfected devotee has a spiritual body and senses, which are manifestations of pure or transcendental sat- tva. A devotee engages in service to the Lord through these pure instruments, one in essence and constitution with unalloyed sattva. Being thus established in truth, one never becomes influenced by the material ego. 
The very last of Brahma-sutras, anavṛttiḥ śabdāt, is cited here, con- firming that once having attained the pure I-concept, or in other words, the true self-identity in relation to Bhagavan, a person does not return to material consciousness.

Kardama thus attained the abode of the Lord, bhagavati gatiḥ. Because he considered everything else as worthy only of indiffer- ence, he was empty of attachment and repulsion, and therefore situated in the vision of equanimity (sama-cetasa). This is also stated elsewhere in Bhāgavatam:

The स्वर्गापवर्गनरकेष्वपि तुल्यार्थदर्शिनः dedicated to Śrī Nārāyana do not fear anything at all. They regard all circumstances as equal, swhether it be promotion to heaven, liberation from material 
existence, or dwelling in hell. (SB 6.17.28)

Another meaning of sama-cetasă is bhagavat-cetasă, or "one whose consciousness is fixed on Bhagavan." As Sankarācārya writes, "Sa means 'with,' and ma is a name of Lakṣmi; since the Lord is always with Lakṣmi, He is known as Sama" (Sahasra- nama-bhāṣya 109).

Endowed with pure intellect; controlling the mind with forti- tude; forsaking sense objects such as pleasing sound; giving up attachment and hatred completely; living in a solitary place and eating little; controlling the body, speech and mind; being ever devoted to the yoga of meditation on the Lord; fully taking refuge in dispassion; giving up egotism, the force of material desires, miarrogance, desires for sense pleasures, anger and possessions; an and being free from the notion of ownership and serene at heart, 
one becomes qualified to realize Brahman. Having realized Brah- adman and being peaceful, one neither grieves nor hankers for any- thing. Being equal to all beings, one attains supreme devotion to Me. Through that supreme devotion, one fully realizes Me in truth, what and who I am. Then, after knowing Me in reality, one enters into Me [achieves sayujya liberation]. (GITA 18.51-55)10 
In other words, in the first reading sama-cetasã and bhagavat-bhakti-yogena are adjectives describing Kardama in a passive construction. The second reading is as an active construction, in which case, bhagavat-bhakti-yogena is the means by which Kardama attained the ultimate destination, and the word sama-cetasă modifies this bhakti-yoga.

Commentary 
hy 
The final realization of Kardama is that of Bhagavan, which is supe- rior to the earlier two realizations. Kardama is called sama-cetasă, one meaning of which is, "situated in the vision of equanimity," similar to the word sama-drk in SB 3.24.44. Yet there is a difference between these two. In the Brahman-realized state one experiences Brahman without a second. But in the distinctive liberated state made accessible specifically through devotion, one perceives the Lord everywhere, while still maintaining his own identity. Thus, Jiva prefers to interpret sama-cetasã as bhagavat-cetasă (whose con- sciousness is established in God). Sa means with, and mã means Lakṣmi Devi; and so sama means the one who is with her, Śri Visņu. Cetasă means conscious (of Him). cadet

If In this verse, bhagavat-bhakti-yoga is the qualified subject. Iccha- dveșa-vihinena and sama-cetasă are its modifiers. A transcendental- ist, because of direct apprehension of, and absorption in, a more profound reality, does not desire anything material, which also implies that he does not hate anything material. Therefore, it is said iccha-dveṣa-vihinena, such a person is devoid of attachment and aversion. Some neophytes think that by aversion to material objects they can progress in spiritual life, but hatred is also attachment in the negative sense. 
Lord Śiva, in the verse cited above (SB 6.17.28), describes how devotees of Śrī Nārāyaṇa are situated in the vision of equanimity (sama-cetasā). This is a reference to King Citraketu, who did not feel morose even after being cursed to become an asura. 
An analogous evolutionary unfoldment from Brahman to Bhaga- vän is described by Śrī Kṛṣṇa to Arjuna (GĪTĀ 18.51-55). These verses describe how a jñāna-miśra-bhakta attains perfection. Of the five verses, the first three explain how he attains Brahman realization, and the last two explain His experience of Bhagavan. 
The verb visate in verse 55 literally means "he enters." The Radi- cal Nondualists interpret this to mean that he merges into Brahman. Such a meaning is inappropriate, however, because a devotee never loses his identity as a servant of the Lord. 
Furthermore, if visate meant merging in Brahman, which is the prior state of attainment referred to in the first group of verses, then the words tad-anantaram (thereafter), which follow it, would become meaningless. am he tho 
The prior verse said that this devotee is brahma-bhūta, mean- ing that he has attained Brahman. The use of the word "thereafter" implies awakening to a yet more comprehensive Reality. Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmi, therefore, explains visate as "he joins" (milana). He gives an example to show that this use of the word visate is not unusual. He refers to the word praviṣṭavan, which comes from the same root, as used in Mahābhārata. 
It is described that just before the battle began, King Yudhiṣṭhira announced that anyone who would like to join his army could do so. At that time, a certain king gave up his affiliation to Duryodhana 
812 
83 Bhagavan Realization Is the Highest Rung on the Ladder of Transcendence 
and joined (praviṣṭavan) the Pāṇḍavas. Therefore, when Kṛṣṇa says viśate, it does not mean that the yogi merges into Brahman, but simply that he joins the Lord in Vaikuntha. 
To further substantiate this conclusion, Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī alludes to Kṛṣṇa's pastime of revealing Vaikuntha to the cowherd men. Once Nanda Mahārāja mistakenly bathed in the Yamuna at an inappropriate time. He was thus arrested by the servants of Varuna and taken to Varunaloka. When Kṛṣṇa came to rescue Nanda Mahā- rāja, Varuņa offered the Lord a grand welcome and worshiped Him. Nanda Mahārāja was quite astounded to see this. Then, when he returned to the village with Kṛṣṇa, he narrated all that had hap- pened, also mentioning how Varuna had worshiped Kṛṣṇa. Hearing this, the cowherd men could understand that Kṛṣṇa is God, and so became eager to see the Lord's abode. They requested the Lord to show it to them. He took them to the Brahma-hrda pond in the Yamuna and asked them to take a dip. While in the water, the cowherd men saw the Brahman effulgence and then the abode of the Lord: 
Śrī Kṛṣṇa revealed the indestructible spiritual effulgence, which is unlimited, conscious and eternal. Sages see that spiritual existence in trance, when their consciousness is free of the gunas of mate- rial nature. The cowherd men were brought by Śrī Kṛṣṇa to the Brahmahrada, made to submerge in the water, and then lifted up. From the same vantage point from which Akrura witnessed the spir- itual world, the cowherd men saw the abode of the Absolute Truth. (SB 10.28.15-16)11 
From these two verses it is clear that the gopas first realized Brah- man and then the Lord's abode. This is also confirmed by Śrīdhara Svami in his Bhāvārtha-dipikā commentary. 
In the next anuccheda, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi will give further proof that bhakti includes and therefore transcends the jñāna-marga,

Commentary once in a 
adity 
IN THIS SHORT SECTION, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi refers to Śrī Kṛṣṇa's teachings to Uddhava, wherein He implies that devotional service is the subsequent and more comprehensive praxis, subsuming brahma-jñāna within its fold. The Lord explains that jñānis should leave aside their jñāna-sādhana, using it as a springboard, rather, into the total feeling and awareness of devotion. He says that jñāna is not the final destination, but only a means to become free from material attachment: 
A person who has imbibed the truth of scripture, who has realized the self, and whose wisdom is not based merely upon inference, should offer that wisdom (jñāna) to Me, knowing well that this world is a manifestation of māyā. (SB 11.19.1)2 
Śrīdhara Svāmi comments that such relinquishment of jñāna is called vidvat-sannyāsa. But Śrī Kṛṣṇa never recommends that one should renounce bhakti. Jñana is the sword with which one can behead the snake of illusion and get free of its snare. After killing the snake, one should discard the sword and eternally repose one- self in the shelter of bhakti, which is like a mother. The killing of the snake does not nourish one, but simply enables the possibility of nourishment. To visto da dguards dohovshi M gidnow old 
In GĪTĀ 2.46, Śrī Kṛṣṇa says that all the purposes served by knowl- edge of the Vedas are necessarily attained by a realized devotee, just as all the purposes served by small reservoirs of water are assuredly served by a vast lake. 
The best examples of vidvat-sannyasa are the Kumāra brothers and Sukadeva Gosvāmī. They set aside jñāna and took to devotion, being captivated by the Lord's qualities. Giving up jñāna means shift- ing the context of awareness from indeterminate Brahman to the distinct transconventional Entity, Bhagavan, equipped with infinite potency. The recommendation in this verse is specifically for those

who follow the path of jñāna. As far as devotees are concerned, they take shelter of Śrī Kṛṣṇa from the very beginning. 
In the next anuccheda, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī cites the personal expe- rience of Dhruva Mahārāja regarding the superiority of Bhagavān over Brahman.

DHRUVA MAHĀRĀJA ALSO TESTIFIED TO THIS, for though he was just a boy, he spoke the truth as it was revealed to him when the Supreme Lord touched his cheeks with His conch, which is the personification of the Vedic revelation or Sabdabrahman. In this way, by the description of the Lord's astonishingly blissful attributes, he stated that ultimate completion belongs only to Bhagavan:

The bliss relished by embodied beings through meditation on Your lotus feet or by hearing the stories of Your devotees is not available even in Brahman, although it is Your own magnificence.

KING UTTANAPADA HAD TWO WIVES, Sunīti and Suruci, and was more attached to the latter. As a result, she was very haughty in her dealings with her co-wife. One day while Suruci's son, Uttama, sat on the king's lap, Suniti's five-year-old son, Dhruva, tried to climb up and join him. When his proud stepmother saw this, she rebuked him. This angered Dhruva, who immediately ran, crying, to complain to his mother. Leontends the doombsto 
Sunīti tried to pacify Dhruva, but being the son of a ksatriya, the boy could not tolerate the insult. He wanted to take revenge, and so asked his mother whether there was anyone in the universe more powerful than his father. She advised him to take shelter of Śrī Nārā- yana. Dhruva took his mother's words seriously, left home at night, and went to the forest in search of the Lord. 
There he met Narada Muni, who initiated him into a Visņu mantra. Dhruva performed severe austerities for six months, after which the Lord appeared before him and blessed him. Upon seeing the Lord, Dhruva fell to the ground and offered respects. Though he wanted to glorify Him, he did not know how to proceed, being just a little boy with no education. The Lord then touched his cheek with His conch shell, which is the personification of transcendental knowledge (brahma-mayena kambuna, SB 4.9.4). It acted like a touch- stone, and Dhruva began to recite prayers, being fully realized in knowledge.

In the verse cited, Dhruva compares the bliss of devotional service with brahmananda and says the former is much superior. Mahima (glory) here refers to Brahman, as is evident from the statement of Śrī Matsya to King Satyavrata: "My mahima is called Parabrahman" (SB 8.24.38)2 og visaibion 
a 
These prayers by Dhruva represent the Vedic conclusion. They are not his own mental concoction or hearsay. He is not merely repeating something he has heard from somewhere, nor is he speak- ing in this way just to flatter the Lord. Otherwise, Maitreya would not have said that he wanted to glorify the Lord but could not do so. Dhruva received knowledge by contacting the Lord's conch, which represents Vedic knowledge. Just Als of biform10m 152 Dhruva said that even hearing the activities of the Lord's devo- tees is much superior to brahmananda. This is because in brahma- nanda there is no positive bliss from engaging in service. There is only a feeling of bliss due to the cessation of material miseries. Any amount of ciphers cannot compare to the numeral one. There- fore, brahmananda is no match for the bliss derived from Bhagavan realization.

TO PROVE THAT BHAGAVAN EXCEEDS BRAHMAN in completion, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī now shows that devotional service is endowed not only with all the significance of mukti, or merging into Brahman, but something of still greater eminence. Thus, devotees do not desire lib- eration if it denies them the possibility of engagement in devotional service. Śrī Kṛṣṇa says: 
821 
Śrī Bhagavat Sandarbha 
One who has surrendered the true self unto Me does not desire any- thing other than Me- not the position of Śri Brahma or the king- dom of Indra, mastery over the Earth, or sovereignty over the nether- worlds. He seeks not the paranormal powers of yoga, nor liberation from birth and death. (SB 11.14.14)1 
A pure devotee of the Lord considers hell, heaven and liberation all the same. This is confirmed by Lord Siva: O 2593oved 
от 
ng The devotees who are completely dedicated to Śrī Nārāyaṇa do not bot fear anything at all. They regard all circumstances as equal, whether Dhrit be promotion to heaven, liberation from material existence or 
dwelling in hell. (SB 6.17.28)2 
Factually speaking, a devotee considers hell superior to imper- sonal liberation. In hell he can maintain his true identity as an inte- grated conscious part, one in essence yet distinct from the Lord, who is the Conscious Whole. With this vision, he can hope still that one day he may become a true devotee. But impersonal liberation entails the state of being eternally merged in an undifferentiated mass of pure awareness. This condition dissolves altogether the possibility of exploring the post-liberated development of the whole-part rela- tion through transcendental love, and thus, in a paradoxical sense, dooms one eternally. When the above verse says that a devotee con- siders both liberation and hell to be the same, the meaning is that he neither hankers for liberation nor abhors hell. If he can engage in devotional service, he can accept any circumstance. noisesedil 
Bilvamangala Thakura declares that liberation stands at his door with folded hands ready to serve him, but he has no interest in her: 
O Bhagavan, if ever my devotion for You should attain steadiness, El then by divine grace Your form as a supernaturally beautiful boy will yin appear before me. When that happens, liberation will stand at my door with folded hands, waiting to serve me, while all the other goals

of life, Dharma, Artha and Kama personified, patiently await their turn. (Kṛṣṇa-karṇāmṛta 107)3 
Devotees embrace this perspective because they relish the sweet- ness of the Lord and His pastimes, which far exceed the bliss of merging in Brahman. 
Bhagavan-nama-kaumudi mentioned in this anuccheda is an authoritative book by Pandita Lakṣmidhara of the Śrī Sampradaya on the science and philosophy of chanting the Holy Name. While commenting on the present verse, he writes, "Causeless devo- tional service unto the Supreme Lord is of greater significance than brahma-jñāna" (chapter 3). 
In the next anuccheda, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī will cite Śrī Kapila to show that Brahman is the incomplete realization of Bhagavän.

IN THIS WAY THE SUPREME LORD, Bhagavan, is the complete Abso- lute Truth (akhanda-tattva). For some practitioners, who are ineligible to realize Him fully, He manifests in a generic way, and that incomplete vision is called Brahman. Śri Kapiladeva clearly explains this in two verses:

Both the jñāna-yoga that is free from the gunas, and the yoga that wlt is focused on Me and characterized by devotion, have one aim, which is indicated by the word bhagavan. A single object is appre- ciated differently by the different senses due to its having many qualities. Similarly, the one Bhagavan appears variously accord- ing to the different paths found in the scriptures. (SB 3.32.32-33)1

Comment by Śrīdhara Svami: "The purpose of this verse is to show that Bhagavan alone is the Entity to be attained by jñāna-yoga, just as He alone is the Entity to be attained by bhakti-yoga, Jñāna- yoga, which is free from the gunas, and the yoga that is character- ized by devotion unto Me, both have the same aim, i.e., the same ultimate end.' What is that end? That which is expressed by the word bhagavan. This is stated in GITA 12.4, 'Engaged in the welfare of all beings, [the followers of the jñāna path] attain only Me."3 
ननु ज्ञानयोगस्यात्मलाभः फलं शास्त्रेणावगम्यते भक्तियोगस्य तु भजनीयेश्वरप्राप्तिः । कुतस्तयोरेकार्थत्वम् । 
"An objection is raised: 'But from scriptures we learn that the result of jñāna-yoga is attainment of the self (atma-lābha), whereas that of bhakti-yoga is attainment of Ïśvara, who is meant to be worshiped. So how can both be said to have the same goal?'

"Anticipating this doubt, Śrī Kapila offers the following exam- ple: 'Though milk is one substance, it is the repository of many qualities, such as form and taste, and thus appears differently when perceived by the different senses.' For example, to the eyes it appears white, to the tongue it appears sweet, and to the touch,

associating nairgunya with jñāna and man-nistha with bhakti. This is not immediately apparent, as the prima facie reading would associate man-nistha with jñāna-yoga, and nairgunya with bhakti-lakṣana. The given translation already 
reflects Śrīdhara Svami's understanding. Śrī Jīva applies both adjectives to both in his commentary, while Viśvanatha explains according to the prima facie reading: man-nistha iti mamaiva brahmatvad iti bhavaḥ. nairgunyo nirguno bhakti-lakṣaṇaś ca yo yogaḥ [...].

Here Bhagavan is singled out as the complete manifestation, inclusive of all parts. Therefore, in this example, bhakti-yoga is compared to the mind, in its capacity to fully ascertain an object through analysis and integration of each of its parts.

Commentary 
hild brow 
IN SECTION 81, ŚRILA JIVA GOSVĀMI EXPLAINED that Bhagavan is the complete and Brahman the partial manifestation of Absolute Reality. These two manifestations appear according to the specific qualifications of the worshiper. Here again Śrī Jiva Gosvāmi con- cludes that Brahman is the incomplete realization of Bhagavan, by referring to the teachings of Śrī Kapila. wod o2 baqidarow sd of 
Every object has manifest characteristics that can be perceived by some or all of the knowledge-acquiring senses - eyes, ears, nose, tongue and sense of touch - and appears differently depend- ing upon which sense perceives it. Two blind men were asked to describe what an elephant is like after having touched it with their hands. The one, who felt the elephant's leg, likened it to a pillar; the other, who felt its tail, compared it to a thick rope. Of course, a man with complete vision would describe it quite differently. Similarly, the viewing capacity of the worshiper is what determines how the Absolute Reality, which is one only, is perceived. 
Those who are drawn towards the indeterminate feature of Abso- lute Reality will perceive only Brahman, which is formless and qual- ityless. Those whose vision is able to pierce through this undiffer- entiated luminosity, behold the transcendental person, Bhagavān, who is its source. To them, who are drawn into a loving relation with the Lord, He appears as a person. As He says: 
826 
87 Brahman Is Not Independent of Bhagavan 
O Partha! I reveal Myself to all who surrender unto Me, exactly in accordance with the essential nature of their surrender. (GĪTĀ 4.11)4 
Although the Lord is supremely independent, He presents Him- self to His worshipers in the feature that appeals to them the most. 
Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmi confirms this truth in his Laghu-bhāga- 
vatāmṛta: 
There are innumerable essential forms existing in Bhagavan. He manifests particular forms to particular worshipers in accordance with their mode of worship. (LBH 1.5.200)5 
Therefore, Śri Kapila says that Bhagavan alone is the Entity to be attained, both by jñana-yoga and by bhakti-yoga. Knowledge of the Absolute divested of manifest qualities and knowledge of the Abso- lute inherently endowed with qualities, both relate to Bhagavan. In GĪTĀ 12.4, Kṛṣṇa says that those who worship His unmanifest, inde- scribable, impersonal feature also attain Him. This is because Brah- man is nondifferent from Kṛṣṇa. In this verse, măm (Me) refers to Bhagavan, i.e., Kṛṣṇa, and the indeclinable eva (only) stresses the identity of Brahman and Kṛṣṇa.ad 
According to logic, an object that is yet unqualified is not differ- ent from the same object when qualified, śuddho visiṣṭän nätiricyate. A man is the same, whether or not he is wearing shoes. Ordinary human beings cannot be with and without shoes simultaneously. But the omnipotent, unlimited Lord can manifest different aspects to different worshipers simultaneously. All the descriptions of Brah- man are perfectly reconciled in the personal form of the Lord. For example, while describing the various Visņu forms seen by Brahmā, Śri Suka says: 
The Visņu forms were embodiments of the one Absolute Essence, constituted of unalloyed being, consciousness and infinite bliss

alone. Their infinite glory was certainly untouched even by those Ver who see with vision refined by study of the Upanisads. (SB 10.13.54) 
Svāmi 
Śrī Brahmā addresses Kṛṣṇa as the complete Brahman: 190 
How fortunate! How fortunate are the residents of Nanda's cowherd community, for their friend is the supreme bliss, the eternal and the complete Brahman. (SB 10.14.32)" 
While glorifying Kṛṣṇa, Mother Devaki says: 
[The Vedas] say that this form is the unmanifest, the original; the effulgence of Brahman (brahma-jyoti), beyond the material qualities, and without transformation. It is pure existence, without attributes ads and without action. Verily, it is You, Visņu Himself, the flame of 
spiritual truth. (SB 10.3.24) als 
These verses clearly describe Krsna as the complete indivisible Brahman. Thus, Śrī Kṛṣṇa says that He is the foundation of Brah- man-brahmano'hi pratiṣṭhāham (GĪTĀ 14.27). Moreover, the qual- ities of Brahman, such as jñāna, ananda and satya, cannot exist by themselves without any substratum, as logic states that qualities must reside in a substance (Nyaya-siddhānta-muktāvalī 86)? 
- 
Therefore, Brahman cannot exist independent of Bhagavan. Śrī Kapila explains this with an example: An object is perceived differ- ently by the different senses. There are five cognitive senses - eyes, ears, nose, skin and tongue - and they each perceive one quality of the five material elements. The eyes see form, the ears hear sound, the nose smells fragrance, the skin feels texture and the tongue tastes flavor. Not all species of life are equipped with all five senses. Thus, the same object can be described differently based on the expe- rience of each of the senses. But all the senses are linked to the mind,

Similarly, the Lord has various qualities, such as jñāna, ananda, sat, form and so on. Vedic scriptures describe various paths, such as bhakti, yoga or jñāna, which lead either to partial realization of some particular aspect of Bhagavan, or to complete realization of Bhaga- van in His totality. Of these paths, bhakti is the most comprehensive because it leads directly to realization of the Complete. All other pro- cesses are likened to maidservants of the queen (i.e., bhakti), who alone can lead one to proximity of the Lord, who is compared to an emperor. The knowledge and experience held by these maidservants about the king is also valid, but incomplete. The experience of the queen, however, whose intimate relation with her husband gives her access to all his secrets, is the most complete. 
So, the Lord says: 
Whatever may be attained by performing karma, penances, jñāna, renunciation, yoga, charity, pilgrimage, vows and so forth, is easily attained by My devotee, simply by engagement in bhakti-yoga to Me. Although My devotee does not desire anything except Me, if at any time he should somehow desire heaven, liberation or residence in My abode, he can very easily attain them. (SB 11.20.32-33)10 
Śrī Sukadeva comes to the same conclusion. In the Second Canto, he describes which of the various devas should be worshiped to fulfill particular desires. But in concluding, he asserts that all desires can be fulfilled simply by the worship of Śrī Kṛṣṇa: the 
Tou 
Lam the 
the enjoyer All people of refined discrimination should worship the Supreme Person through fervent devotion, whether they are unalloyed devo- tees without any personal desire, whether filled with all desires or whether seeking liberation. (SB 2.3.10)"

829avaya Śrī Bhagavat Sandarbhail 
Therefore, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi compares bhakti to the mind. No sense can deliver its perception without the help of the mind; con- sequently, the mind is the king of all the senses. The mind supplies the complete picture of an object, not the individual senses. Simi- larly, no process is able to bring forth its result without the grace of bhakti, and only bhakti can bestow complete realization of the Abso- lute Reality. Therefore, Bhagavan is the Absolute in its feature of highest completion, whereas Brahman is the same Absolute in its partial aspect. 
as The following anuccheda will show that Brahman is subordinate to Bhagavan, like a part to its whole.

THEREFORE, Lord Sankarṣaṇa told Citraketu that Brahman is but 
a fraction of Bhagavan: 
अहं वै सर्वभूतानि भूतात्मा भूतभावनः । 
b. शब्दब्रह्म परं ब्रह्म ममोभे शाश्वती तनू ॥ ४०६ ॥ 
।। 
I expand as all living beings, I am the immanent Self dwelling in all beings and I am the cause of all living beings. Both sabda- brahma and param brahma are My eternal forms. (SB 6.16.51)1

Comment by Śrīdhara Svāmi: "[Lord Sankarṣana told Citraketu,] 'Verily, I am all living beings. Verily, I am also the immanent Self dwelling in all beings, which is to say that I am the enjoyer of every living being. This implies that the cosmos, which is founded on the mutual co-existence of enjoyer and enjoyed, is not something distinct from Me. This is so because I am the cause of all living beings (bhūta-bhavana), or in other words, their illuminator and source.'

"[The Lord answers,] 'That's true, but both are My forms, as stated in the line beginning with śabda-brahma.' Śāśvati [singular form] means both are eternal [śāśvatyau, the dual form].”2 Here ends Śrīdhara Svämi's comment. 
अत्र शब्दब्रह्मणः साहचर्यात् परब्रह्मणोऽप्यंशत्वमेवायाति ॥ श्रीसङ्कर्षणश्चित्रकेतुम् ॥ 
In this verse, it is concluded that param brahma is also a fractional portion of Bhagavan, because it has been described along with śabda-brahma [which is also a fraction]. 
Commentary 
COLOR, WHICH IS ONE OF THE FEATURES OF MILK, can be referred to as part of milk. One who has knowledge only of the color of milk has incomplete knowledge of milk; whereas the knowledge of one who knows the milk's taste, color, smell and so on, is complete. Sim- ilarly, Brahman, being an incomplete manifestation of Bhagavan, is sometimes referred to as His part. 
Phy 
To illustrate this point, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi alludes to Śrī Sankar- şana's instructions to King Citraketu. In this verse the Lord says that sabda-brahma, or the sound-revelation of the Vedas, as well as param brahma, the unqualified aspect of Bhagavan, are His body. That is to say that the sound-revelation of the Vedas and His personal form are nondifferent from each other. The word śāsvati (eternal) is used to counter the idea that these may be material. Bhagavan manifests as Parabrahman and as the sound that reveals Him, which means He is the source of both. He says in GITĀ 10.8, "I am the source of every- thing" (aham sarvasya prabhavaḥ). This verse is an elaboration on the Vedantic mahā-vakya, "Everything is Brahman" (sarvam khalv idam brahma, CHU 3.14.1). 
2 Here Śrīdhara Svami is simply clarifying a grammatical irregularity.ford 
832 
88 Brahman Is Part of Bhagavan 
Sabda is the only valid means of knowledge in regard to tran- scendence, and hearing from realized beings is the first step in God- realization. Thus, the Śruti declares, "The Lord is the one to be real- ized. For this, one should hear of Him, reflect on Him and medi- tate on Him" (BAU 2.4.5). This mantra not only concludes that the purpose of human life is to realize Bhagavan, but also specifies the process. Brahma-bindu Upanisad also recommends: 
Two types of knowledge are worthy of investigation - sabda- brahma and param brahma. After thoroughly imbibing the truth of sabda-brahma, one attains paraṁ brahma. (Brahma-bindu Upanisad 17)* 
It is easy to understand that sabda-brahma is part of Bhagavan. Sometimes it is described as His breath. Because the word tanu (form) is used both for sabda-brahma and the transcendental Brah- man, it is to be understood that both are parts or aspects of Bhaga- vān. This is called the rule of combining likes together, or sahacarya- nyaya. Although the word tanu generally means body or form, here it means energy. The noun tanu is derived from the verbal root √tan, which means to spread or extend. Because both sabda and Brahman have no form, here tanu would mean that both extend as energies of the Lord, and therefore, both are parts of the energetic Supreme Lord, Bhagavan. 
When the Lord says aham vai sarva-bhūtāni, "I am all living beings," it does not mean that the living beings and Bhagavan are absolutely one. That would be ridiculous. The meaning is that Bhaga- van is immanent in all living beings. Though mangoes are wrapped in paper and packed in a wooden crate, they are still referred to as mangoes. The Smrti says: 
Śrī Hari is all living beings because He is within every being

nky Śrī Bhagavat Sandarbha 
Kṛṣṇa says, "The jñāni is My very Self" (jñāni tv ätmaiva me matam, GĪTĀ 7.18). Here again this does not imply that the jñāni and Bhagavan are absolutely one without distinction, but that the jñāni is very dear to the Lord because he is established in awareness of Him. Here the word ātmā is used to indicate the oneness of love and not indiscriminate identity of being. 
The following anuccheda explains that because Brahman is part of Bhagavan, it is considered to be His vibhuti or magnificence.

८९ । अतो भगवतोऽसम्यक्प्रकाशत्वाद् विभूतिनिर्विशेषमेव तदित्यप्याह (भा० ८।२४।३८) 
THEREFORE, since Brahman is the incomplete manifestation of Bhagavan, Śrī Matsyadeva described it to King Satyavrata as the attributeless opulence of Bhagavan: 
मदीयं महिमानं च परब्रह्मेति शब्दितम् । 
•••वेत्स्यस्यनुगृहीतं मे सम्प्रश्नैर्विवृतं हृदि ।। ४०७ ।। 
lgibroming 
You will know My glory, which is celebrated as Parabrahman, for it will be thoroughly revealed to you within your heart, both as a oncresult of your own profound inquiry and My mercy. (SB 8.24.38)1 
महिमानमैश्वर्यं विभूतिर्निर्विशेषमिति यावत् । अत एव मे मया अनुगृहीतमनुग्रहेण प्रका- शितं हृद्यपरोक्षं वेत्स्यसि । त्वया कृतैः सम्प्रश्नैर्मया विवृतमिति । स तु यद्यपि मदनुभवान्त- र्भूत एव स तु ब्रह्मानुभव इत्यतो नास्ति मत्तः पृथगनुभवापेक्षा तथापि भक्तिप्रकाशितसा- क्षान्मदनुभवे तन्मात्रानुभवो न स्फुटो भवति । यदि तदीयस्फुटतायां तवेच्छा कथञ्चिद् वर्तते तदा सापि भवेदिति भावः । 
Mahima means aiśvarya, that is, opulence without manifest attributes (nirviśesa). Therefore, by My mercy (anugrhita), it will manifest in your heart (hrdi), meaning you will experience it directly (vetsyasi) in the trans-egoic state (aparoksa). Because 
madīyaṁ mahimānaṁ ca para-brahmeti sabditam 
vetsyasy anugṛhitam me sampraśnair vivṛtam hrdi 
835 
Śri Bhagavat Sandarbha 
of your profound inquiry, I will explain it to you. As the experi- ence of Brahman is included within the experience of Me, there is no need to experience anything other than Me. Nevertheless, in the direct experience of Me, made explicit through devotion, the singular perception of Brahman is not very explicit. Still, if ever you should wish to experience it clearly, then that will also occur. This is the intent of the passage. 
अत एव (भा० १० । ४६।३१) — 
Similarly, Śri Uddhava said: 
एतौ हि विश्वस्य च बीजयोनी रामो मुकुन्दः पुरुषः प्रधानम् । अन्वीय भूतेषु विलक्षणस्य ज्ञानस्य चेशात इमौ पुराणौ ॥ ४०८ ॥ (इति श्रीमदुद्धववाक्यम् ।

REVERED8 
These two Lords, Mukunda and Balarama, are each the life-giving seed [i.e., the efficient cause] and the womb [i.e., the material cause] of the cosmos, both conscious creator (purusa) and inert primordial nature (pradhana). They enter the hearts of living beings and regulate them as well as unqualified Brahman. They are the primeval Supreme. (SB 10.46.31)2

Commentary 
ESTR 
SECTION 7 DESCRIBED BRAHMAN as indeterminate knowledge of Bhagavan. Śrī Matsyadeva here confirms this in speaking to King Satyavrata. The Lord refers to Brahman as His glory or opulence (mahima). Just as fire has brilliance or sugar has whiteness, the Lord has Brahman as His quality. Logically, qualities do not contain 
biogs-anssi sda ni (iznyar 2 etau hi viśvasya ca bija-yonī rāmo mukundaḥ puruṣaḥ pradhanam

3 See also Section 3 for more on indeterminate knowledge. 
836 
89 Brahman Is the Attributeless Magnificence of Bhagavan 
other qualities. Similarly, Brahman, being a quality of Bhagavan, is nirviseșa, without attributes. 
Though the whiteness in sugar is not different from the sugar, one nevertheless cannot experience it independently; similarly, Brahman is not independent of Bhagavan. Thus, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī comments that the experience of Brahman is not independent of the experience of Bhagavan. 
A man who is overly attached to eating sugar candy may not pay any heed to its whiteness. Though he is aware that it is white, he may remain quite oblivious to it, because he is not drawn to that fea- ture. In fact, diverting attention to its color would be considered an obstruction to his deep absorption in its taste. Similarly, when the self is drawn through devotion to the complete personal Absolute, Bhagavan, he becomes disinterested in Brahman. He not only has no interest in it, but even considers it distasteful, because it deprives one of the taste of devotion. If, however, a devotee should somehow develop a desire to realize Brahman, owing to the association of an ātmārāma, the Lord may provide him this experience at some time. 
When Śrī Kṛṣṇa sent Uddhava to Vraja with a message for the gopis, he spoke to Nanda and Mother Yasoda the verse quoted in this section (SB 10.46.31), which states that Brahman is controlled by Krsna and Balarama. 
6179180 
In this verse, jñāna, being in the singular, does not refer to the liv- ing beings, since they are many. Therefore, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī says that jñāna here means Brahman. This is also confirmed by its adjec- tive vilakṣaṇa, or that which is distinct from the living beings. Brah- man is sometimes called jñāna, as in the Śruti, "Brahman is truth, awareness and infinity" (satyam jñānam anantaṁ brahma, TU 2.1). 
In the following section Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi will cite further references to show that Brahman is the vibhuti of Śrī Kṛṣṇa. 10 (sy

O Lord, the universal egg, everything inside it, its ten coverings, the three gunas, the unmanifest primordial nature (pradhana), ov the conscious beings (purusa), the supreme destination (param padam) and Parabrahman, which lies behind the beyond, are all Your opulences? 
पैङ्गश्रुतावपि तद्गणपातित्वेन श्रूयते “एष पुरुष एष प्रकृतिरेष आत्मैष ब्रह्मैष लोक एष अलोक एष योऽसौ हरिरादिरनादिरन्तोऽनन्तः परमः पराद् विश्वरूपः” इति ॥ श्रीभगवान् ।। 
Painga-śruti also counts Brahman as part of Bhagavan: "This puruşa, this prakṛti, this ātmā, this Brahman, this world and the worlds beyond sight, are Śrī Hari, who has no beginning and no end, who is within everything, beyond everything and also manifests the universal form."3 
Commentary 
IN THIS SECTION, ŚRILA JIVA GOSVĀMI cites Śruti (Painga), Smrti (Srimad Bhagavatam) and sadhu-pramāņa (Śrī Yamunācārya) to prove that Brahman is the opulence of Bhagavan and thus subor- dinate to Him. 
In chapter 16 of the Eleventh Canto, Śrī Kṛṣṇa enumerates His opulences while speaking to Uddhava. The verse quoted above is a summary, which explains that everything from the grossest element (earth) up to Brahman is an opulence of Bhagavan. He is the source of everything, including Brahman. 
Alabandārācarya, popularly known as Yamunācārya, is the parama-guru of Śrī Rāmānujacārya. He wrote a famous prayer glo- rifying Bhagavan, called Stotra-ratna. Painga-śruti is not available

BECAUSE THE VARIEGATEDNESS OF THE LORD is not evident in the Brahman effulgence, it is therefore also referred to as the glow of the Lord.

Commentary 
Śrī Bhagavat Sandarbha 
AT NIGHT, WHEN ONE SEES a light bulb from a distance, it appears like a mass of light. When viewed up close, however, one recog- nizes its distinguishing features - the glass covering, the filament, the metal end and so on. In the same way, the Lord appears like an undistinguished mass of luminosity to the jñānis, and thus scrip- tures sometimes describe God-realization as the experience of the Lord's bodily effulgence (brahma-jyoti). Bhagavan is dharmi or the Entity who encompasses attributes within His fold, and His brah- man effulgence is dharma or the encompassed attribute. Śrī Brahmā confirmed this in his prayers to Kṛṣṇa in the verse from Brahma- samhitä. 
Just as variety is not distinguished in a mass of light, similarly Brahman is nirviseṣa. Niskala means that Brahman has no parts. Because it is without limit, it is called ananta. Another point to be noted is that in the word "Brahman effulgence" (brahma-jyoti), the effulgence itself is Brahman and vice versa. It is not that the efful- gence is a quality of Brahman, which would imply that Brahman is separate from the effulgence. If Brahman is to be understood as the possessor of effulgence, then Brahman would mean Bhagavan. 
In the following anuccheda, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi will give numer- ous references to show that Bhagavan exceeds Brahman. th

THEREFORE, ŚRI RUDRA TESTIFIED explicitly to the Pracetas that Bhagavan is beyond Brahman: 
यः परं रहसः साक्षात् त्रिगुणाज् जीवसञ्ज्ञितात् । भगवन्तं वासुदेवं प्रपन्नः स प्रियो हि मे ॥ ४१२ ॥ 
A person who is surrendered directly to Bhagavan Vasudeva, who is transcendental to the living entity, to the three gunas and even and to the Mystery [i.e., the Supreme Brahman], is very dear to me. (SB 4.24.28)1 
THE 
“पित्रानुवर्णितरहाः” (भा० ३ | १५ | ४६ ) इति श्रवणेन रहो ब्रह्म तस्मादपि परं ततः सुतरां त्रिगुणात् प्रधानाज् जीवसञ्ज्ञितात् जीवात्मनः परं भगवन्तं यः साक्षात् श्रवणादिनैव न तु कर्मार्पणादिना प्रपन्न इत्यन्वयः । 
In the phrase, "the mysteries described by our father" (pitrānu- varnita-rahāḥ, SB 3.15.46), the word rahas (mystery) meant Brah- man. Since Bhagavan is beyond even this Brahman, it naturally follows that He is transcendental to pradhana, consisting of the three gunas, and to the living entity (the jiva). One who surren- ders to Him "directly," i.e., by engaging in acts of intrinsic devo- tion, such as hearing about Him, and not merely through the

extraneous offering of the fruits of work [is dear to me]. This is the natural syntax of the sentence. 
तथा च विष्णुधर्मे नरकद्वादशीव्रते श्रीविष्णुस्तवः - 
Similarly, in Vişnu-dharma Purana, in the narration of the vow of naraka-dvādaśī, a hymn glorifying Śrī Visņu states: 
आकाशादिषु शब्दादौ श्रोत्रादौ महदादिषु । प्रकृतौ पुरुषे चैव ब्रह्मण्यपि च स प्रभुः || ४१३ || येनैक एव सर्वात्मा वासुदेवो व्यवस्थितः । तेन सत्येन मे पापं नरकार्तिप्रदं क्षयम् ।

The one Supreme Lord Vasudeva, the Immanent Self of all selves, permeates the elements, such as the sky; the subtle elements, such as sound; the senses, like the ear; the mahat, prakrti, puruşa and also Brahman. Let my root sin [of non-awareness of Him], which is the cause of hellish misery, be undone by understand- ing this truth, and may I, who am harmonized with virtue, grow ever-victorious in Spirit with each passing day?

92 Scriptures Describe Bhagavan As beyond Brahman 
[By performing devotional service,] I will attain the same natureAV as the Lord, who permeates the Parabrahman, the manifest cosmos and the unmanifest material nature.3 
तत्रैव मासर्क्षपूजाप्रसङ्गे ततः परत्वं स्फुटमेवोक्तम्– 
In the same Viṣṇu-dharma Purana, in the description of the wor- ship of the lunar asterisms, it is clearly stated that Bhagavan includes and transcends Brahman:

at O immeasurable Lord Acyuta, O Supreme Self! You are transcen-d dental even to Parabrahman, which is beyond everything in the material world. O Acyuta, please fulfill my aspiration and dispel my misery.*

VP 1.15.55 also declares, "You are beyond Brahman, the Supreme Transcendence," and the Śruti instructs, "The Lord is beyond imperishable Brahman" (MUU 2.1.2). 
Commentary 
IN THIS SECTION, ŚRILA JIVA GOSVĀMĪ CITES more references that directly describe Bhagavan as inclusive of and exceeding Brahman. The principal verse is spoken by Śri Rudra to the Pracetas, who were ordered by their father, Prācīnabarhi, to create progeny. Lord Siva appeared and blessed them by teaching them to worship Bhagavan

In this verse, the word rahas (mystery) means Brahman. As we saw in Section 79.11, the Kumāras used the same term to indicate Brahman when they informed Śrī Viṣṇu that Brahma had instructed them in knowledge of Brahman (pitränuvarṇita-rahāḥ, SB 3.15.46). 
According to Medini lexicon, one meaning of rahas is Absolute Reality, "Rahas means tattva, conjugal relation and secret" (rahas tattve rate guhye, Medini 32.31). Therefore, the meaning of Rudra's statement, param rahasaḥ, is that the Lord is beyond Brahman. The other meanings of rahas are not applicable here because Rudra states that the Lord is beyond the three gunas, triguṇāt. This means that the rahas referred to here does not belong to the three gunas, but is beyond them; otherwise, there would be no need to state it explicitly. 
Similarly, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī gives numerous references from the Purānas and the Upanisads that confirm Rudra's statement. Śrī Kṛṣṇa also told Arjuna: 
Since I am beyond both the perishable [the living beings] and the imperishable [Brahman], I am known both in the Vedic literature and among the people of the world as Purusottama, the Supreme browed 
Person. (GĪTĀ 15.18)" 
In Kṛṣṇa's statement, the word kṣara refers to the conditioned liv- ing beings, and akşara refers to Brahman. This is clear from Kṛṣṇa's earlier statement, "All living beings are called perishable, and Brah- man, which is changeless (kūṭastha), is imperishable" (GĪTĀ 15.16). 
Therefore, in his commentary on GĪTĀ 15.18, Śrīla Viśvanatha Cakravarti Thakura writes, "Śrī Kṛṣṇa is beyond the living beings, beyond the imperishable Brahman, and beyond even the unchanging Paramātmā, known as Purusa."

92 Scriptures Describe Bhagavan As beyond Brahman 
sarvātmā and vasudeva can be misinterpreted to mean complete consciousness and all-pervading consciousness, respectively. But that would not fit the context, which is a description of the dvādaśī- vrata for the pleasure of Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Moreover, words such as sa (he) and prabhu (the Lord) directly refer to a person. 
The partial verse cited from Vişņu Purāņa was spoken by Soma, the moon god, to the Pracetas. The complete verse is as follows: 
e is as follows: 
Śrī Visnu is beyond the cosmos, beyond the totality of finite and infi- nite potencies, beyond cause, and the embodiment of the substan- tiality of the beyond. He is beyond Brahman for He lies perpetually behind the beyond. He is beyond all liberated beings and beyond even all-conquering Time. (VP 1.15.55)10 
This verse clearly describes that Bhagavan is beyond everything, including Brahman. This is also confirmed by the statements of the Śruti, "Nothing is equal or superior to the Supreme Lord" (na tat- samas cabhyadhikaś ca dṛśyate, śu 6.8). 
In the following anuccheda, Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmi will analyze the Śruti-stuti prayers from the Tenth Canto. He begins with an analysis of the Bhrgu-valli section of Taittiriya Upanisad to show how it too establishes the supremacy of Bhagavan over Brahman. The Advai- tavādīs consider the Upanisads and the Vedanta-sutra as the highest authority and build their theory of Brahman based on them. There- fore, to quell all opposition and dispel all lurking doubts, he will now show how all the prasthana-trayi, namely, Vedanta-sūtra, Upanisads and Bhagavad Gitä, unanimously proclaim Bhagavan as Supreme.

IT IS WITH THE SAME INTENTION of showing that Bhagavan is superior to Brahman that Taittiriya Upanisad describes the puruşa as being one in essence with successively more and more subtle items, beginning with the statement, "This puruşa is com- posed of the essence of food" (TU 2.1). The concluding statements of this description are successively, "This is the supporting tail"1 (TU 2.1), "The Earth is the supporting tail" (TU 2.2), "Atharvāngi- rasa [the hymns of Atharva-veda] are the supporting tail" (TU 2.3), "Mahaḥ2 is the supporting tail" (TU 2.4), and finally, "Brahman is the supporting tail" (TU 2.5)3 Bhagavan is superior even to Brah- man, the fifth and last of these supports described in TU 2.5. 
1 The word "tail" (puccha) here is a metaphor which compares different degrees of perception of the purusa to birds, whose head, right wing, left wing and tail are compared to different things. Translations of the Upanisads, such as that by Max Müller, often avoid puccha and simply use the word that succeeds it, pratiṣṭhā ("seat" or "support"), which indicates the metaphorical intent. 
2 Mahaḥ is translated in various ways, as "the great," "intellect" (Müller), and "the 
material world" (Aurobindo).

ALATID) Toy auoly 
Śrī Kṛṣṇa says in Śrī Gita Upanisad, "I am the support of Brah- man" (GĪTĀ 14.27). The placement of the word pratiṣṭhā in near succession of the word brahma in this Gītā verse reminds one of the aforementioned Śruti passage [in which a nearly identical placement of words is found, brahma puccham pratiṣṭhā]. 
ततश्चैवमेव व्याख्येयं हिशब्दः (गीता १४।२७) - 
Therefore, the word hi [in GITA 14.27, indicative of cause] should be explained as confirming the same conclusion [i.e., should be understood as showing the reason why Bhagavan is superior to Brahman], because it indicates a causal relationship to the immediately preceding verse: 
मां च योऽव्यभिचारेण भक्तियोगेन सेवते ।

(GĪTĀ 14.27) explains the reason why Brahman is attained by ren- dering service to Bhagavan, a fact that was mentioned in the pre- vious verse (GĪTĀ 14.26). Therefore, [in Kṛṣṇa's statement, "I am the basis of Brahman"] it would be inappropriate to interpret Brahman reductively as, "the śakti of Brahman," or as, "Hiranya- garbha" [as if to say that Kṛṣṇa is not the basis of Transcendental Brahman but only of the śakti of Brahman. This interpretation, however, would not explain how Brahman is attained by service to Bhagavan]. So, only the above meaning is fitting, as shall be elaborated below.

यथा – ननु त्वद्भक्त्या कथं निर्गुणब्रह्मधर्मप्राप्तिः सा तु त्वदेकानुभवेन भवेत् ? 
An objection may be raised in regard to GĪTĀ 14.26: "How can one attain to the nature of qualityless Brahman by means of devo- tional service to You, Kṛṣṇa? Is not such an attainment possible only by the experience of oneness with Brahman?" 
तत्राह “ब्रह्मणो हि” इति । हि यस्मात् “ब्रह्मपुच्छं प्रतिष्ठा” ( तै० २।५।१) परमप्रतिष्ठत्वेन श्रुतौ यत् प्रसिद्धं तच् च तस्यामेव श्रुतौ आनन्दमयाङ्गत्वेन दर्शितम् । तस्य पुच्छत्वरूपितब्र- ह्मणः “आनन्दमयोऽभ्यासात्” (ब्र० सू० १ । १ । १२) इति सूत्रकारसम्मतपरब्रह्मभाव आनन्द- मयाख्यः प्रचुरप्रकाशो रविरितिवत् प्रचुरश्चानन्दरूपः श्रीभगवानहं प्रतिष्ठा । 
To answer this doubt, Śrī Kṛṣṇa speaks the next verse, "It is so because I am the support of Brahman." In this statement, hi means because. That Brahman which is celebrated as the 
supreme support in the Śruti passage, "Brahman is the sup- porting tail" (brahma puccham pratiṣṭhā, TU 2.5.1), is shown in the very same Śruti to be [just one of] the limbs of the Bliss- ful One (anandamaya-puruşa). "I, Bhagavan, am the support of that Brahman," described there metaphorically as a tail, since the Parabrahman has been named "the Blissful One," in accordance with the author of Brahma-sutra, "Brahman is anan- damaya, being repeatedly referred to as such" (vs 1.1.12)," and "I

am the form of that abundant bliss, just as the sun is the form of abundant light." 
यद्यपि ब्रह्मणो मम च न भिन्नवस्तुत्वं तथापि श्रीभगवद्रूपेणैवोदिते मयि प्रतिष्ठात्वस्य परा काष्ठेत्यर्थः – स्वरूपशक्तिप्रकाशेनैव स्वरूपप्रकाशस्याप्याधिक्यार्हत्वात् निर्विशेषब्र- ह्मप्रकाशस्याप्युपरि श्रीभगवत्प्रकाशश्रवणात् । 
The import of the above is that though I [Śrī Kṛṣṇa] and Brahman are not different in substance, the existential condition of being the support (pratiṣṭhā) for subsumed dimensions of being finds its ultimate expression only in Me, as I appear in the aspect of Bha- gavan. This is befitting, because it is only through the manifesta- tion of the "essential potency" (svarupa-śakti) that the "essential nature" (svarupa) too manifests its feature of highest completion. For this reason scriptures declare that the Bhagavan feature is superior even to that of unqualified Brahman. 
अत एकस्यापि वस्तुनस्तथा तथा प्रकाशभेदो रजनीखण्डिनो ज्योतिषो मार्तण्डमण्डलत- गतगभस्तिभेदवदुत्प्रेक्ष्यः । 
So, even a single object has different manifestations as such, just as the night-destroying luminous sun is metaphorically said (utprekṣya) to have different manifestations, such as its orb and the rays that emanate from it. 
अतो ब्रह्मप्रकाशस्यापि मदधीनत्वात् कैवल्यकामनया कृतेन मद्भजनेन ब्रह्मणि लीयमानो ब्रह्मधर्ममपि प्राप्नोतीत्यर्थः । 
Therefore, since the Brahman manifestation is dependent on Me, a person can attain the nature of Brahman by merging into it through devotion to Me, performed with a desire to attain to attain kaivalya, or oneness. This is the intent of the verse.

In this regard, Visņu Purana distinctly states: "He is the auspi- cious shelter of the all-pervading Self, which is pure conscious- ness" (VP 6.7.75)

The cvi suffix1o is used here [in the word ghani-bhūta] only figura- tively to signify that previously, Bhagavan was not yet manifest in the heart of the worshipers of Brahman, since at that time they were attentive only to Brahman.

Some people read pratima (representation) in place of pratiṣṭhā in Śrīdhara Svāmi's commentary. This is the product of imagina- tion spurred by hostility, and was certainly not written by him,

10 The cvi-pratyaya is used to indicate the transformation of one thing into another by adding the suffix -i to an existing noun or adjective and joining it to a form of the verb "to become" (bhu) or "to make" (kr). In this case, ghani-bhūta would mean "becoming dense," and so it could be conjectured that Śrīdhara Svami's intention is to say that Bhagavan is a transformation of Brahman. 
852 
93 Bhagavan Is the Shelter of Everything, Including Brahman 
as it does not fit the context. It is not possible for there to be a representational form of the formless Brahman, any more than the sun is a representational form of its own light. Nor is it pos- sible to say that the Lord is the representative image (pratima) of liberation, signified by immortality (amṛtatvasya), imperishabil- ity (avyayasya) and other terms appearing in the three remain- ing lines of the verse." Such an explanation does not accord with the [earlier quoted] statements of the Śruti and Visnu Purāṇa. So this gloss of pratiṣṭhā as pratimă should not be regarded as valid. If it is to be so accepted, however, it should be interpreted only in the sense of aśraya, "the repository, or in other words, the per- son or form in whom Brahman subsists." The word pratimă would then have to be understood according to its etymological deriva- tion, giving the sense of "measuring" (mati), i.e., delimiting the entity that is being designated (prati)."12

The second chapter of Taittiriya Upanisad is called Ananda-valli, or "The Creeper of Bliss;" it describes the Lord as the supreme mani- festation of joy. The first part of the chapter explains that Brahman is the support of everything, and the succeeding part describes the Lord as the shelter of the various levels of ananda. The Upanisad begins by defining Brahman through a gradual progression, first in terms of the gross body, followed by the vital-force (prāna), the mind (manas), the self or ātmā (vijñāna) and finally the blissful (ananda)

30 This step-by-step method is called arundhati-pradarśana-nyāya, or "the technique of pointing out the star Arundhati." It is customary in Vedic culture to show this star to a bride just after her marriage, as Arundhati is the protector of chaste womanhood. But it is not so easy to spot this star. To indicate it, the priest first points to the constella- tion called Saptarși (the Seven Sages), or Ursa Major. Next he points to one of the stars in Ursa Major, and finally to Arundhati, which is next to the star named Vasistha.vswod borganos o ad 
Similarly, it is not easy to grasp the concept of Brahman. Thus, the Śruti mercifully approaches the matter by drawing our atten- tion from gross matter, to subtle force and mind, to causal being, and beyond, till we are led, at last, to its complete manifestation, which encompasses all subsidiary levels of being. 
guisd af 18

In this analysis, as well as in the ones that follow, the body, mind and so on, are described as a purușa, or a person. The puruşa is com- pared to a bird, which consists of various parts: the head, left wing, right wing, mid-section and tail. Nevertheless, although the mantra apparently describes a bird's body, the teaching must be applied to the human form, as it is meant for human beings. In this case, the left and right arms would represent the wings, and the posterior is compared to the tail. Just as the tail supports the bird, the lower body supports the upper. This is the meaning of pratiṣṭhā as used in the metaphor. The mid-section, referring to the chest, is the ātmā, because that is the most vital part of the body. 
The first mantra (TU 2.1) describes the puruşa as being made of the essence of food (anna-maya). The body is there described as the self, ayam ātmā. This understanding is for people who are attached to the body and consider it their very self. The body is neatly described as being made of food (anna-maya). 
Next, the Upanisad (TU 2.2) defines the purusa as the vital force (prāṇa-maya), which is beyond the anna-maya covering. The five divisions of the vital force that represent the five limbs are prāna, apāna, samāna, udana and vyāna. Their respective seats in the body are as follows: 
854 
93 Bhagavan Is the Shelter of Everything, Including Brahman 
Prāna is in the heart, apana in the anus, samana in the navel, udāna in the throat, and vyäna pervades the whole body! 
In the previous mantra, food was referred to as the basis of the body, but more important than food is the vital force, which is more subtle even than the breath. Life cannot be sustained even for a moment without the circulation of this force. Therefore, this mantra draws attention to the vital force that circulates within the subtle energy-matrix, interior to and hence beyond the physical body. 16 The next mantra (TU 2.3) describes the puruşa in terms of the mind (manas). The mind is interior to both the gross body and the vital force; it is like the ātmā for both of them, which is to say that they become animated through its influence. The word mano-maya refers to the mental body, which includes the mind, the material ego, intelligence and citta, or consciousness. The mayat suffix in mano-maya implies the predominance of the mind. Knowledge is attained by the action of the mind, or in other words, the mental body. Thus, śruti here refers to the knowledge found in these mental components. 
con absomal m 
But beyond the mental body is the vijñāna-maya self, which is conscious by nature and thus upholds knowledge. Therefore, the next mantra (TU 2.4) describes the puruşa as the self. The self is the ātmā (i.e., "the animating principle") for all the previous purusas. Vijñāna-maya refers to the living being, the possessor of conscious- ness, and not just to consciousness proper. Its limbs, referred to by the words śraddha, ṛta, satya, yoga and mahas, are different aspects of knowledge. 
thened sdi 
The self is not self-supporting, rather its existence inheres in, and thus depends on, the Supreme Immanent Self, Paramātmā. The next mantra therefore describes the puruşa as the blissful Supreme Person (ananda-maya): a bhre Arth 
Apart from the individual self (vijñāna) there is another Self within, who is the embodiment of bliss. By this Self, the individual self is

Sapcompleted. He is immanent in the living being. He is also a per- son. Love (priya) is His head; amusement (moda), His right wing; and enjoyment (pramoda), the left. Bliss (ananda) is His self, and Brahman, His supportive tail. (TU 2.5)14 
onmi srom tod 
The Upanisad has thus taught us about ultimate reality, lead- ing us from the gross body all the way to the Supreme Person, who is the innermost Self, encompassing all conscious selves and all dimensions of being. 
The word ananda-maya means full of bliss. It does not mean that the Supreme Person is merely a transformation of bliss. Thus, His head, wings and mid-section, i.e., moda, pramoda and so on, are also bliss. According to Śrī Ranga Ramanuja Muni, an ācārya in the Śrī Sampradaya, priya means the happiness of beholding the entity or object longed-for; moda, the joy of attaining that entity or object; pramoda, the joy of active engagement in regard to the entity or object, and ānanda means all-exceeding joy. This is the passage of the Upanisads referred to by the Vedanta-sutra when it says, "Brah- man is ananda-maya, being repeatedly referred to as such" (ananda- mayo'bhyāsāt, vs 1.1.12). 
This analysis from the Śruti describes each successive purusa as the ātmā of the previous purusa. But the ananda-maya-puruşa is the ātmā of them all, meaning that He is the one utterly complete Self in which everything else inheres. He is none other than Śrī Kṛṣṇa, as confirmed by Sukadeva Gosvāmi: 
You should know this Kṛṣṇa to be the original Self of all selves. For the benefit of the world, He has appeared here by His mercy, as though an embodied being. (SB 10.14.55)15-tonal Hoes

In the Gita verse, however, the Lord names a sixth pratiṣṭhā Himself, thus supplementing and completing Taittiriya Upanisad's analysis. 
The Taittiriya mantra (TU 2.5) compares Brahman to the tail of the purușa. Like the other limbs of the blissful puruşa, Brahman is one of His parts. This means that Bhagavan is the Complete Whole and Brahman is subordinate to Him, being His limb or part. 
In a famous verse, Śankarācārya compares the Upanisads to a cow and Bhagavad Gita to its milk, or essence. Gopala Kṛṣṇa is the one extracting this immortality-giving nectar for the benefit of the whole cosmos. It is thus proper to say that Śrī Kṛṣṇa's statement is a summary conclusion of the discussion found in the Ananda-valli chapter of Taittiriya Upanisad. 
As such, Lord Śri Krsna is superior to the fifth and topmost sup- port (pratistha), which is Brahman. Kṛṣṇa asserts this fact Him- self: "I am the support of Brahman" (brahmano hi pratisthäham, GĪTĀ 14.27). Here the Lord supplies the essence of the Taittiriya mantras cited above. Since Brahman is described as the supportive tail of the ananda-maya-puruşa, it cannot be considered material. But the Lord Himself is described as the whole, or in other words, as complete bliss, ananda-maya. Just as the sun has innumerable rays, but is itself a mass of light containing rays, similarly the Lord is the complete manifestation of bliss, and Brahman is a part of Him. 
There is no difference between Brahman and Kṛṣṇa, but Brah- man is without manifest energies. Therefore, Kṛṣṇa is a more encom- passing reality than Brahman, just as the sun is a more encompass- ing reality than its rays. Rays are dependent on and under the con- trol of the sun. Similarly, Brahman is dependent on and controlled by Śrī Kṛṣṇa. For this reason, one can attain Brahman realization through the worship of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, but it is never possible to attain

Kṛṣṇa through meditation on Brahman. Indeed, one cannot even realize Brahman without the mercy of Śrī Kṛṣṇa.swa ber 
Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī next goes on to discuss the meaning of brah- mano hi pratiṣṭhāham in the context of chapter 14 of Bhagavad Gitā. In GĪTĀ 14.21, Śrī Arjuna asked Śrī Kṛṣṇa how a person can become free from the three gunas of material nature. The Lord concluded his answer in GĪTĀ 14.26 by saying that through engagement in pure devotional service to Him, one can become free from the gunas and established in Brahman awareness. 
Kṛṣṇa then speaks the next verse in anticipation of the following doubt, "You are a person, and Brahman is a qualityless, energyless, imperceptible entity. How can one realize Brahman by worshiping You?" Krsna's answer is that it is possible because He is the shelter of Brahman. 
To support this conclusion, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi refers to Śrīdhara Svāmi's commentaries on both this Gītā verse and VP 6.7.75. In both these places, Śrīdhara Svämi accepts that Bhagavan encompasses the greatest vastitude of being, exceeding even that of Brahman, because He is the basis even of Brahman. 
However, in many editions of Sridhara Svāmi's commentary on GĪTĀ 14.27, pratiṣṭhā is explained as the deity image, or pra- timă. This seems to be either an interpolation or the result of a scribal error, because unqualified Brahman cannot have a form. While commenting on VP 6.7.75, Śrīdhara Svāmī writes that pratiṣṭhā means shelter;" therefore, it is unlikely that he would translate it as "image" or "deity" in his Bhagavad Gita commentary when such an interpretation is completely inconsistent with the context.

Only those who are obedient to You are actually alive; otherwise, their breathing is like that of a bellows. By Your grace alone, the elements, such as mahat and ahankära, have created this egg-shaped body. As the ultimate form of the purușa, encom- Epassing all sub-levels of being, You have entered here, in these five sheaths, or in other words, in the five substratums of being, beginning with anna-maya. You are beyond both sat and asat and are, consequently, the remainder of all five substratums and the reality that supports them all. (SB 10.87.17) 18 
असुभृतो जीवा दृतय इव श्वसदाभासा अपि यदि ते तव अनुविधा भक्ता भवन्ति तदा श्वसन्ति प्राणन्ति । तेषु तद्भक्तानामेव जीवनं जीवनं मन्यामहे इति भावः । कथम् ? यस्य तव अनुग्रहतः समष्टिव्यष्टिरूपमण्डं देहं महदहमादयोऽसृजन् अतः स्वयमेव तथाविधात् त्वत्तः पराङ्मुखानामन्येषां दृतितुल्यत्वं युक्तमेवेति भावः । 
The living beings (asu-bhṛtah) merely appear to be breathing, exactly like a bellows, but if they are obedient (anuvidha) to You, i.e., if they become Your devotees, then they are truly alive and breathing. The import is that amongst all living beings, it is the life led by Your devotees that we consider to be true living. How so? By Your mercy, elements like the mahat and aham create both the macrocosmic egg (anda), in the form of the universe, and the microcosmic egg, in the form of the body. So, if any living beings are averse to you when Your nature is inherently such [i.e., so merciful], it is only appropriate to consider their breathing to be of no greater significance than the movement of a bellows.

Next the Śrutis point out the Lord's mercy by saying, "You have entered here," namely, in the elements like mahat and aham.

Furthermore, among all the statements specifying the various supports (pratiṣṭhās) in the same section [of Taittiriya Upanisad], You are the remainder (avaśesa), or vakya-seṣa, i.e., the part needed to complete the definition of Brahman, such as the renowned statement found [in GITA 14.27], "I [Śrī Kṛṣṇa] am the support of Brahman."

So, amongst anna-maya, and so on [amongst the ascending sup- ports given in Taittiriya Upanisad], that which was stated to be the ultimate (carama) support, having the form of a purusa (purușa-vidha), is You, the Blissful One (ananda-maya), because You are the whole of which priya, moda, pramoda, ānanda and Brahman are the parts.

The overall idea is, therefore, that it is certainly correct [to say] that by Your presence the elements, such as mahat and aham, attain their capacity [to create the universe], because You enter into them as the original supreme form of ananda. Taittiriya Upanisad also says: "If Brahman, the personification of bliss, were not in the sky [or in the heart], who else would infuse activity and maintain the vital force [in the universe or in the individual body]" (TU 2.7.1)?20

In this context the following is to be said: Although a single object may have many attributes in its essential nature, it is observed that only that vision which is equipped with appropriate capac- ity can be a suitable instrument for perceiving every one of those attributes, and no other. For example, the gross faculty of sight can perceive the sun orb only as a mass of light, whereas the celes- tial vision can discern the heavenly assembly and other objects within the sun, despite its being purely luminous in essence. Similarly, in this case, since devotion is the complete potency,

namdes

Sri Bhagavat Sandarbha 
it is only by devotion that one can perceive the Absolute in its completeness- and that is Bhagavan, because He alone is the complete manifestation of Absolute Reality.

stamil 
Since it has been shown that jñāna is an incomplete means, real- ization of the Absolute achieved by it is also incomplete. That [incomplete realization] is Brahman, which is the incomplete manifestation of Bhagavan.

Because one-dimensional jñāna apprehends the Absolute only in a generic way [as something beyond prakṛti without any specific form or qualities], it is unable to capture the inner and outer distinctions within it. It therefore remains only on the periph- ery. As such, though the devotee transcendentalists experience the wonderful variegatedness within the self-luminous Supreme Truth, jñāna captures only its light in a general way. And so Brah- man is understood metaphorically as Bhagavan's effulgence. It is, moreover, also called the rarefied form, the portion, or the opulence of Bhagavān. Therefore, it is appropriate that Bhaga- van, who is the undivided [i.e., the complete] Absolute Reality (akhanda-tattva), is the shelter of Brahman, which is the glow of the Lord's form, since Brahman is identified as but a generic manifestation of that same Absolute.

"He whose body is the earth, whose body is the Self, whose body is the unmanifest and whose body is the imperishable (aksara) [Brahman], is the Supreme Immanent Self dwelling within all beings, free from all sins, the one divine Nārāyaṇa" (Subāla Upanisad 7.1).21

nisms Jarl 
The only possible meaning for the word akṣara here is Brahman, and this is so primarily for two reasons. First, by the process of elimination (päriseşya-pramanena) of the meanings already indi- cated by the other words in the passage, such as ātmā and avyakta, the only appropriate remaining meaning is Brahman. Secondly, akṣara is used in exactly the same way in the following statement, "They experienced a commotion both in mind and in body, even though they delighted in the Imperishable (akṣara)" (SB 3.15.43).22 
तथा श्रीभगवता साङ्ख्यकथने “कालो मायामये जीवे” (भा० ११।२४।२७) इत्यादौ महाप्रलये सर्वावशिष्टत्वेन ब्रह्मोपदिश्य तदापि तस्य द्रष्टृत्वं स्वस्मिन्नुक्तम् (भा० ११ । २४।२७) - 
While teaching the Sankhya philosophy in SB 11.24.27, Śrī Kṛṣṇa states that during the final dissolution only Brahman remains. But after this, using the words paravara-dṛṣā, He says that He is a witness of Brahman even at that time:

Let us here consider the following: Sänkhya means knowledge. The Sankhya scripture explains only the svarupa of the Absolute that remains at the time of dissolution, without examining the attributes inherent in its own nature. That which remains is indeed called Brahman. sdi 101

It is proper to say that after the cosmos is dissolved, Brahman remains at the furthest boundary of the material sphere, just like Vaikuntha, without any manifest qualities of the Lord's svarupa. तच् च स्वविशेष्यमात्रं स्वरूपशक्तिविशिष्टेन वैकुण्ठस्थेन श्रीभगवता पृथगिव तत्रानुभूयत इति । तदेवं निर्विशेषत्वेन स्पर्शरूपरहितस्यापि तस्य भगवत्प्रभारूपत्वमुत्प्रेक्ष्य तदभिन्न- त्वेन ब्रह्मत्वं व्यपदिष्टम् । ततः स्पर्शरूपादिमाधुरीधारितया सविशेषस्य साक्षाद् भगवदङ्ग- ज्योतिषः सुतरामेव तत् सिद्ध्यति । यथोक्तं श्रीहरिवंशे महाकालपुराख्याने श्रीमदर्जुनं प्रति स्वयं भगवता (ह० व० २ । ११४ ।९-१२ ) -

Indeed, Brahman is Bhagavan's own feature, but as yet unquali- fied (sva-viśeşya-matra), and is experienced as if different from Bhagavan, who is replete with internal potency and is situated in Vaikuntha. In this way, although Brahman has no tactil- ity or form owing to being without attributes, by regarding it metaphorically as the effulgence of the Lord, Brahman is indi- cated as being nondifferent from Him. Because the original and complete Bhagavan is inherently self-endowed with mellifluous attributes, such as touch and form, the glow of His bodily limbs is even more appropriately indicated as Brahman. By way of exam- ple, in the Mahākālapūra narration in Hari-vaṁśa Purāṇa, Śrī Kṛṣṇa tells Arjuna:

O best of the Bharatas, the transcendental supreme Brahman effulgence that you witnessed is Me. It is My eternal effulgence. It is My transcendental, eternal, manifest and unmanifest nature. Entering into it, the grand-masters of yoga attain liberation. Osta sil Partha, it is the supreme destination for those who adhere to the all path of Sankhya, and for the yogis and ascetics as well. That Sup- reme Brahman is distinct from the material creation. O Bharata, To you should know Me to be the dense [form of that] effulgence.

In these verses, by specifying prakṛti (nature) as the glow of His own form, Kṛṣṇa indicates that prakṛti here refers to His inter- nal potency (svarupa-śakti). Similarly, the statement cited ear- lier from Visnu Purana, regarding the Kaustubha gem,25 should be understood as fortifying the above conclusions.

Commentary e 
with 
After introducing the key issues involved in the Taittiriya Upanisad passage, Śrī Jiva turns to the primary Bhagavatam verse of this sec- tion, taken from the prayers of the personified Vedas or Śrutis. Each of the verses from this important chapter of Bhagavatam is based on some portion of the Śruti, either the Upanisads or Veda-samhitās. It is thus truly a direct commentary on the Vedanta. The verse cited here is similarly a commentary on the Taittiriya passage and must be analyzed in its light. In this verse, the Śrutis recognize Śrī Kṛṣṇa as the aśraya-tattva, or the supreme shelter of everything, including Brahman. 
baeng sd 
The Śrutis refer to Bhagavan as carama, the ultimate of all the purusas, beginning with anna-maya. They say, furthermore, that He has a form like a human, purusa-vidha. The word ṛta, or truth person- ified, in this verse should also be taken to mean the personal form of the Lord, because that form is the complete whole. Everything else is His part. 
The mantra from Subala Upanisad also explains that aksara (the imperishable) is Bhagavan's part. Akṣara means Brahman. This is understood by the process of eliminating the meanings already indi- cated by the other words in the verse. In this mantra, since pṛthivi, or earth, signifies the material elements, avyakta, the unmanifest mate- rial nature, and ātmā, the living being, the only remaining meaning that can be assigned to akṣara is Brahman. 
The verses quoted from Hari-vamsa Purana also describe Brah- man as Śrī Kṛṣṇa's effulgence. This effulgence was personally expe- rienced by Arjuna when he was on his way to see Mahāviṣṇu along with Kṛṣṇa. Later on, he inquired about this effulgence from the Lord. In reply, Kṛṣṇa spoke the verses cited above, confirming that the effulgence Arjuna had witnessed was Brahman, attaining which, the jñānis become liberated. 
ple, In this way, from the statements of the Upanisads, Vedānta-sūtra, Bhagavad Gita, the prayers of the personified Upaniṣads and the Purāņas, it has been shown that Brahman is the quality-less feature of Bhagavan. Because it is a feature of Bhagavan, it is sometimes 
866 
93 Bhagavan Is the Shelter of Everything, Including Brahman 
called His portion, His energy or His effulgence. Those who worship the Absolute as Brahman realize it by the mercy of Bhagavan, but they fail to understand that Bhagavan is the complete manifestation of the Absolute. 
In the following anuccheda, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi will show that Bha- gavan is the primary meaning of the word brahma.

The Primary Meaning of the Word Brahma Is Bhagavan 
९४ । ततश्च यस्मिन् परमबृहति सामान्याकारसत्तायास्तदङ्गज्योतिषोऽपि बृहत्त्वेन ब्रह्मत्वं तस्मिन्नेव मुख्या तच्छब्दप्रवृत्तिः । तथा च ब्राह्मे – 
THEREFORE, THE PRIMARY INTENT of the word brahma applies to Bhagavan alone, who is supremely great, and whose generic exis- tence, which is His bodily glow, is also called Brahman because of its greatness. This is confirmed in Brahma Purāṇa: 
अनन्तो भगवान् ब्रह्म आनन्देत्यादिभिः पदैः । 
प्रोच्यते विष्णुरेवैकः परेषामुपचारतः ॥ ४२५ || इति । 
ear The primary meaning of terms like ananta, Bhagavan, Brah- man and ananda applies only to Śrī Viṣņu; when they refer to something else, those are secondary meanings. 
क्वचिच् चानन्तगुणयुक्तत्वेनैव भगवान् ब्रह्मेत्युच्यते । यथा पाद्मे- 
Sometimes Bhagavan is called Brahman because He possesses unlimited attributes. As Padma Purana states:

94 The Primary Meaning of the Word Brahma Is Bhagavan 
Because the Lord has immeasurable attributes, it is not possi- ble to delineate all of them separately. Therefore, they are col- lectively indicated by the word brahma. Thus, the word brahma can be an adjective for the all-pervading Śrī Visņu alone, and no other, as He alone has unlimited qualities? 
अत्र निर्गलितोऽयं महाप्रकरणार्थः - यदद्वयं ज्ञानं तदेव तत्त्वमिति तत्त्वविदो वदन्ति । तच् च वैशिष्ट्यं विनैवोपलभ्यमानं ब्रह्मेति शब्द्यते वैशिष्ट्येन सह तु श्रीभगवानिति । स च भगवान् पूर्वोदितलक्षणश्रीमूर्त्यात्मक एव न त्वमूर्तः । 
तु 
This then is the essential meaning of this lengthy subject [i.e., Bha- gavat Sandarbha] as a whole: [In SB 1.2.11, it was said that] those who have directly witnessed Absolute Reality (tattva-vidaḥ) declare that nondual awareness is verily the Absolute Reality. When this nondual truth is realized without any attributes, it is called Brahman, but when realized with attributes, it is called Bhagavan. Moreover, this Bhagavan is certainly nondifferent from His form, which is naturally endowed with the attributes described earlier. He is not formless.

To one who has attained complete devotion for Him, the Lord appears in a transcendental form (para-mūrta), such as śyā- masundara or a four-handed Visņu form. To the neophytes on the path of worship, He appears in a phenomenal form (apara- mūrta) like the viśva-rūpa, or universal form, in which Pātāla is conceived as the feet, and so on. To a person steeped in barren awareness (ruksa-jñāna), the Absolute manifests as transcenden- tal yet formless Brahman (para-amūrta). And to one endowed with devotion in which is found a predominance of jñāna, He manifests as the immanent yet invisible Iśvara (apara-amurta), or the Indwelling Supreme Self. rohin

The latter manifestation's aparatva, or immanence, is only in rela- tion to the supreme transcendental form, para-murti, which is a higher order revelation, and for which it is like a stepping stone. Amurta [in this case] does not mean complete formlessness, as it does with Brahman. Nor should the word apara here be taken to mean "inferior;" it is used only to contrast it with the form of supreme transcendence (para-mūrti).

In the same chapter of Viṣṇu Purāṇa, the statement, "That form called viśva-rūpa is another great form of Śrī Hari" (VP 6.7.70); 
tad viśva-rupa-vairupyam rūpam anyad dharer mahat 
87094 The Primary Meaning of the Word Brahma Is Bhagavān 
shows that this form of the Lord is eternal and all-pervading because it is the support of the universe. The statement, "The form of the Lord, while existing as the support of everything, is free of expectation" (VP 6.7.78), indicates that the Lord's form is free from extraneous qualities (nirupadhitva). Further it explains that His form is of the nature of Supreme Transcendence (para-tattva), "One should meditate on Him, the embodiment of Brahman" (VP 6.7.83).

Finally, by the statement, "He is transcendental to the three manifestations of the Absolute, which are revealed in correspon- dence to the consciousness and internal disposition (bhāva) of the perceiver" (VP 6.7.76), it is shown that the supreme transcen- dence (para-tattva) is beyond the three familiar manifestations of the Absolute [i.e., viśva-rupa, Iśvara and Brahman], which are revealed respectively in correspondence to the paths of karma, a combination of jñāna and karma, and exclusive jñāna. Even in the Absolute characterized as the supreme transcendence (para- tattva), the utterly complete manifestation of that Supreme Real- ity (samyak-prakāśa), because it is revealed only through pure devotion, is in that Entity alone who is self-endowed with form. Thus, it is said, "He is the auspicious shelter even of the transcen- dental Self, the all-pervading consciousness" (VP 6.7.76)

For, in chapter 3 of the First Canto, the Lord possessing form is described as the source of all avatāras, "This Supreme Person [the second manifestation of the Purusa] is the imperishable seed of the innumerable avataras appearing within the cosmos, and the abode to which they return. From a portion of His [i.e., from Brahma] and from a portion of that portion [i.e., from the sages such as Marici, who were brought forth by Brahma] the gods, men animals and other life forms are created" (SB 1.3.5).10 The characteristics of that form are given at the beginning of that chapter: "While this Puruşa was sleeping in yoga-nidrā on the causal waters, Brahma, the chief of the creators of the universe, appeared from the lotus that grew from His navel lake.

that form of the Lord, upon whose limbs the expanse of the plan- ets is imagined to stand, is endowed with potency and situated in pure being. With profound vision, the rșis see this extraor- dinary form with thousands of feet, chests, arms, and faces, a thousand heads, ears, eyes and noses, brilliant with a thousand crowns, vestments and ornaments" (SB 1.3.2-4)."

Śrī Rāmānujācārya reads tad viśva-rupa-vairupyam in place of tad viśva-rupa-rupam vai [in VP 6.7.70], rendering the sense as fol- lows: "The greatness of Hari is apart from the deformity of the viśva-rupa" [which could be interpreted as supporting formless- ness]. Yet in spite of this reading, his comment clearly empha- sizes the Absolute with form, "The form of the Lord is distinct from this universal form. By this statement it is established that the Absolute Truth has a real form that is different from the universal form."

So, when there is mention of the Lord's form as the viśva-rupa, having hands, legs and other limbs, extending everywhere, it should be understood that this form too is not different from His divine form possessing the previously expressed characteristics.

This verse means that although the Lord's form is of the nature of Parabrahman and is immeasurable in all respects, He, hav- ing attained the form of eternal youth, enjoyed with Lakṣmi. Although the verse says, "He attained youth (upeyivan)," it should be taken to mean that He is eternally youthful. This should be understood in the same way as the statement, "He, whose sins have been destroyed" (apahata-papmā), meaning that He is eternally free from sin. Furthermore, there are many definitive statements in the same series of verses that establish that even the transcendental abode, encompassing threefold dimensional- ity of being, and which is supported by His form, is absolutely eternal. A statement to this effect is made in the same section:

For this reason the Subala Upanisad statement cited by Śrī Rāmānujācārya, beginning with, "He whose body is the earth," and ending in, "He is the supreme immanent Self dwelling within all beings, free from all sins, the one divine Nārāyaṇa" (Sub- ala Upanisad 7.1), establishes the forms of the puruṣāvatāras, who are but portions of Bhagavan, as the Supreme tattva. Thus, through the a fortiori argument (kaimutya), Bhagavan, who is the whole of these portions, is certainly the personification of the parama-tattva. Various statements to this effect were quoted in the earlier part of this book, and more will be cited again further 
on.

Absolute Reality has two features, murta, with form, and amurta, formless. These two features can be either perishable or imper- ishable in nature, and are situated in all living beings. The Sup- reme Brahman is imperishable, akşara, and this entire cosmos is the perishable, kṣara. (VP 1.22.53-54) Bozing ovinovÁTĚ V

O sage, the aksara is eternal and complete, whereas the cosmos is subjected to the divisions of appearance, disappearance, creation and destruction. (VP 1.22.60 ) 18 
तदेतदक्षराख्यं परब्रह्म नित्यमखिलं जगत् तु आविर्भावादिभेदवदित्यर्थः । तत्राविर्भावति- रोभावौ श्रीविष्णुतदंशानां जन्मनाशौ त्वन्येषाम् । अतो जगत्याविर्भावादिकृत्येनैव पूर्वेषां (ब्रह्मादीनाम्) तदन्तःपातव्यपदेशो न वस्तुत इत्यर्थः । 
श 
The meaning is that this Parabrahman, called aksara, is eternal and complete, but the cosmos undergoes the changes of appear- ance and disappearance, creation and destruction. The words appearance and disappearance are intended for Śrī Visnu and His expansions, whereas birth and death are for all others. Because devas, like Brahma and Śiva, appear and perform other acts in the universe, they are counted as part of it, but they are not so in reality. This is the meaning. 
तथ सदा स्वधाम्नि विराजमानत्वेन क्षररूपतो मूर्तत्वादिना चाक्षरतोऽपि विलक्षणं तृतीयं रूपं भगवतः परमं स्वरूपमिति पुनरुच्यते (वि० पु० १ २२ ६१-६४ ) - 
P 
Viṣṇu Purana further explains that Bhagavan is distinct from the perishable forms, kṣara-rupa, because He is eternally situated in His own abode. Furthermore, He is distinct from the imperish- able, akṣara-rupa [i.e., Brahman], because He has transcendental attributes, like form. He is the third form [beyond both kṣara and aksara], the ultimate form and nature of Bhagavān:

For Śri Visņu is all powerful and situated in His own essence. In the early stages of yoga, the yogis meditate on the form of Śrī Viṣņu, which is distinct from Brahman. He is beyond all potencies, for He is the truth lying immediately behind Brahman. Hari is Brah- man personified, and He constitutes the complete Brahman. This whole universe, lengthwise and crosswise, is interwoven in Him. (VP 1.22.61-64)19

That He lies immediately behind Brahman is to say that, in accordance with one's progress on the path of worship, Bhagavan is the truth that is revealed immediately after realiza- tion of akṣara Brahman. This is also in conformity with GĪTĀ 18.54, wherein it is said that He manifests after the realization of Brahman. This is the meaning.

Because He is the supreme shelter of all intrinsic potencies, He constitutes Brahman in its totality, sarva-brahma-maya, and is therefore the personification of the complete Brahman. But the prior manifestation, called akṣara, is partial in nature, owing to being devoid of potencies.

Although the word akṣara in GĪTĀ 15.16, "The unchangeable self is called akṣara,"21 refers to the pure jiva, it can also indicate Parabrahman, because it was earlier stated, "Akşara is Parabrah- man" (GĪTĀ 8.3). Since both entities are purely conscious in nature, the word aksara refers to them both.

The original Complete Person, Svayam Bhagavan, who is cer- tainly endowed with form (murta), has all the characteristics of the Supreme Tattva under discussion.

Commentary 
asared of ballgefesd 
THIS SECTION IS ROOTED in the understanding that the one Absolute is perceived differently in accordance with the consciousness of the perceiver. Its central verse is given at its conclusion: 
As Kṛṣṇa entered the arena with His elder brother Balarama, He was recognized differently by each observer: the wrestlers saw Him as a bolt of lightning, the ordinary menfolk saw Him as the best of while the women saw Him as Cupid personified. The cowherds thought of Him as a relative, while the evil kings saw Him as their punisher, and His parents, as their child. King Kamsa recognized InHim as his death, while the ignorant thought of Him as something 
great. The yogis perceived Him as the Absolute Truth, and the Vṛṣṇis, Thas their worshipable deity. (SB 10.43.17)24 
Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī begins this section by continuing his expla- nation that Brahman is one of the features of Bhagavan. The bod- ily effulgence of the Lord is called Brahman because it is immense. The primary meaning of Brahman is Bhagavan. Brahman means "great," or "unlimited." Śrī Vişņu, or Krsna, is the greatest and most unlimited person; therefore, He is called Brahman. Dhruva Mahā- rāja, while praying to Śrī Visņu, gave the etymological meaning of the word brahma in the following verse: 
be O Supreme Self of all selves, I offer my obeisance to Your form, which is meditated upon by the yogis and is thus free from all mutation. That form is called Brahman because it is limitlessly expansive and as limitlessly causative of others to expand. (VP 1.12.55) 25 wobne viniai bahn at whit di nolaidall tohar avis marques to 
In this verse, Dhruva clearly says that Śrī Vişnu's form is called Brahman. Because the Lord is nondifferent from His body, He is certainly the complete Brahman.

88094 The Primary Meaning of the Word Brahma Is Bhagavān 
At this point, Śrī Jiva resumes his explanation of the vadanti tat tattva-vidaḥ verse (SB 1.2.11), which is in fact the essential insight that he is trying to illustrate in Bhagavat Sandarbha, namely that the one Truth, or tattva, is perceived differently by different persons according to their particular approach to that Truth. 
According to the philosophy of Srimad Bhagavatam, Absolute Reality is one. When He manifests with attributes He is called Bha- gavan, and when He manifests without them He is called Brahman. As explained in earlier anucchedas, Bhagavan has an eternal tran- scendental form. According to VP 6.7.47 Absolute Reality manifests in four ways: 
1. Para-murta, the transcendental Absolute, replete with transcen- 
dental form, such as Śrī Kṛṣṇa and His plenary expansions. 2. Apara-murta, the phenomenal Absolute, or in other words, the Absolute appearing as the cosmos, having a conceptualized form, such as the universal form (viśva-rupa). er es un-pro 3. Para-amurta, the transcendental Absolute, devoid of form, which 
is Brahman. 
24. 
bo 
4. Apara-amurta, the immanent Absolute, who is without visible form, i.e., whose form is imperceptible due to immanence. This refers to the form of the Lord as Iśvara, the indwelling Supreme Self, who is the ground and source of creation. 
Br 
According to Śrīdhara Svāmi, the fourth category is apara- amurta, and this manifestation refers to Paramātmā. Truly speaking, Paramātmā, or Iśvara, is not amurta, or formless. Rather, His form as the indwelling Self remains unseen due to His quality of immanence. Here apara does not mean inferior, phenomenal or conceptualized, as in the case of apara-murta, i.e., the viśva-rupa. Rather, it implies a form other than the form of Bhagavan (na para iti aparaḥ). This latter phrase could also be rendered, "Immanence is that which is other than transcendence." Moreover, the word amurta (formless) does not mean formless, as in the case of para-amurta, but a form which is similar to and leads to the supreme form, i.e., Bhagavan. The nañ prefix is applied not only in the sense of negation, but in six senses, as is stated: 
hin mant 
881 
vene Śrī Bhagavat Sandarbha 
There are six meanings of the prefix nañ [which remains as a- before 1rig words beginning with a consonant, and as an- before words begin- redning with a vowel]: similarity to, absence of, difference from, a por- tion of, a degenerative condition of, and the opposite of, the word to which it is applied.26 
On the basis of this rule, the word amurta in the fourth category can be understood as, "having a form similar to murta," i.e., similar 
nom sH us. to the transcendental form. 
EVER 
To those who have true loving devotion unto the Complete Per- son, Bhagavan, the Absolute manifests in His para-murti, His tran- scendental form. For beginners on the path of upāsanā, the Absolute manifests as apara-murti, in His universal form. For the adherents of jñāna-märga, the Absolute manifests as para-amurta, transcenden- tal Brahman without form. For those who worship the Lord in devo- tion, but with excessive attention to jñāna, the Absolute manifests as apara-amurta, as the immanent, imperceptible Supreme Self, the internal regulator of material nature. 
Although there are four manifestations of the Absolute, the ulti- mate reality is a transconventional person, or para-murta. This is evident from the statements of Śrī Sūta Gosvāmī: 
This Supreme Person [the second manifestation of the Purusa] is the imperishable seed of the innumerable avatāras appearing within the cosmos, and the abode to which they return. From a portion of His [i.e., from Brahma] and from a portion of that portion [i.e., from the sages such as Marici, who were brought forth by Brahma] the bongods, men, animals and other life forms are created. (SB 1.3.5)27 
Thereafter, having listed the various avatāras, Sūta Gosvāmī says that Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the original Supreme Lord (SB 1.3.28). That the ultimate reality is different from the universal form is confirmed in VP 6.7.70, viśva-rupaṁ vai rūpam. This means that He has a tran- scendental form. In the alternate reading of this verse, vairupyam

882 
94 The Primary Meaning of the Word Brahma Is Bhagavan 
means that His form is different from the viśva-rupa. Bhagavan is the source of all types of manifestations, but He is not dependent on anything else: 
ball 
The Lord has a distinct form which is independent of any other sup- port and free of desire. (VP 6.7.78) 28 
guiteam ashiq an 
This para-murti of Bhagavan is eternal. Although there are state- ments such as, "The Lord accepted a form" (PP 6.227.7), these do not indicate that prior to the acceptance of form, the Lord was formless. Such statements indicate the actions that He manifests to His devo- tees. For Him, the acceptance of form is without beginning - it is eternal. Otherwise, nothing else could have form. 
Therefore, the primary meaning of the word tattva in verses like vadanti tat tattva-vidaḥ is Bhagavan. This is confirmed in Maha- nārāyaṇa Upanisad: 
Śrī Nārāyaṇa is the Supreme Brahman. He is the Supreme Tattva. He is supreme effulgence, and He is the Supreme Self. (MNU 11.4)29 
There are many statements that establish the various expansions of Krsna as the Supreme Reality. It naturally follows then that the source of such expansions, Kṛṣṇa, is the Supreme tattva, beyond both the mundane manifestation as well as Brahman. Although Brahman is sometimes described as indivisible and complete, it is Bhagavan who is the Complete Indivisible Reality. Brahman is devoid of manifest qualities and thus cannot be considered akhanda- tattva, or the Complete Reality. This is expressed by Śrī Kṛṣṇa when He says that He is Purusottama, transcendental to both kṣara and akṣara (GĪTĀ 15.13). 
Akşara refers both to the individual self as well as to Brahman, because both are infallible and imperishable. The complete man- ifestation of Absolute reality is Śrī Kṛṣṇa, as Śrī Śuka describes, tattvam param yoginām, "The yogis saw Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Real- ity" (SB 10.43.17).

From this analysis, it is clear that the primary meaning of the word brahma is the Supreme Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, He being the greatest of all and the source of everything. He is the advaya-tattva, the nondual Absolute Reality, and He manifests in various forms. eds pesibel In the next anuccheda, Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmi will explain that Śrimad Bhagavatam is the topmost Vedic literature because it has the power to attract the Absolute Reality, Śrī Kṛṣṇa.

The one truly-abiding Substan- tive, which grants auspiciousness and uproots the threefold mis-9 eries, is the truth investigated here in Srimad Bhagavatam.

prescribed for the virtuous (satām), attentively engaged in their prescribed duties, and who are without envy (nirmatsarāṇām). Matsara (envy) means intolerance of the value found in others, which is typical of those who hanker for the fruits of their actions. Nirmatsara means "an absence of this envy" and by extension also includes those merciful people who do not kill animals. Valle Цитой

Although it is not stated explicitly, Srimad Bhagavatam is supe- rior to both the karma-sastra and upāsanā-śästra in establishing its conclusions, because in both instances [the purpose is to] give rise to dharma. This being the case, it cannot be expected that the intrinsic [devotional] dharma of hearing and chanting the Lord's pastimes, expressed in Bhagavatam, would be found in these other texts.

The statement, "The one truly-abiding Substantive is the truth to be investigated here" (vedya), indicates that Bhāgavatam is similarly superior even to the jñāna-śästra. The jñāna-śästras, which are generally indifferent to devotion to Bhagavan, lack definitive knowledge of the Truth which is to be known (vedya), as is stated, "Those who spurn devotion to You, the path of sup- reme blessedness, O Supreme Lord, and suffer many hardships to attain enlightenment, are left in the end with nothing more than their fatigue. It is useless labor, like pounding husks in the hope of obtaining rice" (SB 10.14.4). This indicates that defini- tive knowledge of the Absolute can be obtained only here, from Srimad Bhagavatam.

Śrīla Vyasa further describes the unique excellence of Śrīmad Bhagavatam, completing what is lacking in the one-dimensional scriptures of the jñāna-marga: "It grants auspiciousness and uproots the threefold miseries" (śivadam tapa-trayonmulanam). The phrase "grants auspiciousness" (śivada) means that it causes one to experience the supremely blissful nature of the Lord, and the phrase, "uproots the threefold miseries," means that it destroys ignorance, their root cause. The unique characteristic of Srimad Bhagavatam that distinguishes it from other scriptures [i.e., of the jñāna-marga], is that the latter admit of no experi- ence in the state of liberation, and therefore, liberation of that kind is, technically, not a puruşärtha, or a substantive reality to be attained. Bhagavatam, on the other hand, accounts for transcendental experience in the post-liberated state.

Furthermore, the cause of attaining these rare goals is not just the wonderful style in which Srimad Bhagavatam is composed, but is in its very nature (svarupa). This is demonstrated by the name of the book itself: Bhāgavata means that it establishes Bhagavan, and śrimat means that it has the potency to do so in its essential nature, just as all the names and other attributes of Bhagavan also inherently contain such potency. The suffix -mat (matup) is used to indicate eternal union with, or inclusion of, the qual- ity to which it is affixed [in this case, to śrī or potency]. Hence, by writing śrimad-bhagavate as a compound word, the author has informed us that this is the complete name of the book, such as in the case of a "blue lotus" (nilotpala). Otherwise, it would 
888 
95 Śrīmad Bhagavatam Is the Complete Scripture 
introduce the defect called avimṛṣṭa-vidheyamsa, wherein the pri- mary member of a compound word is treated as secondary. alat

Thus, Garuda Purāņa states, "The book containing 18,000 verses is called Śrīmad Bhagavatam," and the commentator [Sridhara Svāmi] writes, "The book called Srimad Bhagavatam is a divine tree." Therefore, if it is sometimes called just Bhāgavatam, we should understand that this is an abbreviated form, just as Satyabhāmā is sometimes shortened to "Bhāmā."

The underlying cause of Bhagavata's being so influential is that its author is supremely eminent. This is expressed by the word maha-muni (the great thinker). In this case the appellation refers to none other than Śrī Bhagavan, since He alone is supremely proficient in deliberation, and because He is the crest-jewel of all greatly influential persons. The Vedas affirm, "He, the Lord, deliberated after becoming a muni, or thinker."5 The Lord first manifested an abridged version of Bhagavatam in four verses; or as stated, "He enlightened Brahma in this Śrimad Bhagavatam" (SB 12.13.19). This means that He also revealed it in its complete form.

realization of the Supreme Person, who is the crest-jewel of all goals of human life, and who is described as the Supreme Know- able in all the scriptures dealing with spiritual knowledge, is eas- ily available only in Srimad Bhagavatam. In this way while declar- ing the excellence of Srimad Bhagavatam even over that of the Upāsanā-kāṇḍa, Vyasa affirms its preeminence: "What need is there then for any scripture other than this" (kim va paraiḥ)? 
परैः शास्त्रैस्तदुक्तसाधनैर्वा ईश्वरो भगवान् हृदि किं वा सद्य एवावरुध्यते स्थिरीक्रियते । वाशब्दः कटाक्षे । किन्तु विलम्बेन कथञ्चिदेव । अत्र तु शुश्रूषुभिः श्रोतुमिच्छद्भिरेव तत्क्ष- णादेवावरुध्यते ।

[The question can be understood as follows:] Does the Supreme Lord, Bhagavan, become immediately arrested or established within the heart as a result of hearing any other scripture, or by following any other spiritual practices (sadhanaiḥ) recom- mended by them? The word va in this question (kim vā) is used ironically to indicate that if at all this may happen, it can occur only after a long delay. On the other hand, here [in the case of Srimad Bhagavatam], the Lord is captured in the heart at the very moment one simply desires to hear it. 
ननु इदमेव तर्हि सर्वे किमिति न शृण्वन्ति ? तत्राह - कृतिभिरिति सुकृतिभिरित्यर्थः । श्रवणेच्छा तु तादृशसुकृतिं विना नोत्पद्यत इति भावः ।

A question may now be raised: "Why is it then that everyone does not hear or study this book?" In answer, the verse says that the inspiration to do so arises in the virtuous (kṛtibhih). The import is that without some special merit, the desire to hear Bhāgavatam does not manifest. 
अथवा अपरैर्मोक्षपर्यन्तकामनारहितेश्वराराधनलक्षणधर्मब्रह्मसाक्षात्कारादिभिर् उक्तैरनु- क्तैर्वा साध्यैस्तैरत्र किं वा कियद् वा माहात्म्यमुपपन्नमित्यर्थः । 
Alternatively, if we read the words kim vã paraiḥ as kim va aparaiḥ (What need then is there for anything inferior?), the meaning would be as follows: How great a significance can be attributed to any other attainable spiritual goal, whether stated herein or not, including religious duties (dharma) involving worship of the

Lord devoid of all desire, even that for liberation, or including even the direct realization of Brahman?

This is so, because the Lord is held only momentarily in the heart of those virtuous persons who have attained fulfilment (kṛtārtha) owing to the grace of the bhakti that ensues from these other prac- tices. The same Lord, however, becomes permanently established in the heart from the very moment they merely desire to hear Srimad Bhagavatam.lo

Therefore, Śrimad Bhagavatam is superior to all other scriptures because it explicitly reveals the secrets of the three divisions of the Vedas [karma, jñāna and upāsanā], and more particu- larly, because it embodies the knowledge that attracts the Lord. Because of this, the term atra ("here," in this book) has been emphasized three times. Therefore, this book alone is to be heard and studied by everyone at all times. This is the essence.

IN THE PREVIOUS SECTION, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi demonstrated that Bhagavan is the complete and indivisible Absolute Reality and that all other manifestations are dependent on and thus inferior to Him. This is the central theme of Bhagavat Sandarbha. The primary mean- ing of words like tattva and brahma find their support only in Bhaga- vän. According to the degree of eligibility of the worshiper, Bhaga- vän manifests in different features: in His personal form to the devo- tees, as Paramātmā to the yogis, and as unqualified Brahman to the jñānīs. To the devotees who are influenced by His majestic feature, He manifests as Iśvara. All these various features simultaneously exist in the person of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the original form of Bhagavan. 
891 
adg2 Śri Bhagavat Sandarbha 
How can one understand and realize Bhagavan? To answer this, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi begins this anuccheda and establishes that it is pos- sible to do so by the power of hearing Srimad Bhāgavatam. Although there are various types of scriptures available, Śrīmad Bhāgavatam is unique in relation to all other spiritual texts, owing to its inherent power to attract Bhagavan, as defined earlier. In the epistemologi- cal section of Tattva Sandarbha, Srimad Bhagavatam was shown to be the topmost pramāņa, having the highest validity in the matter of the complete understanding of transcendence. Here it is shown further- more that Śrīmad Bhagavatam can grant the ultimate end of all that may be aspired to. By glorifying the means of attaining that ultimate end (i.e., Bhagavan), the author simultaneously glorifies Bhagavan. 
With this in mind, Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī analyzes the second verse of the book. This verse succinctly establishes the qualifications for hearing Śrimad Bhagavatam and the effects of hearing it on the recip- ient. It is customary to mention these things at the beginning of a book.vib grad 
There are many processes that lead to the realization of God, but none is so potent as hearing Śrimad Bhagavatam. The complete Abso- lute, Bhagavan, is attracted simply by the desire to hear this unique work, which reveals Him. But the desire to hear this truth revelation appears only in the hearts of the virtuous (kṛtibhiḥ). Absence of envy, defined as intolerance of the value found in others, is the principal sign of such virtue. Only those who are free from this ego-centered and ego-fortifying disease are qualified to realize Bhagavan, for it is the barrier that prevents entry into the spiritual realm. Vaikuntha is completely free from any trace of such envy. Thus, Srimad Bhaga- vatam is meant for satām, or those established in the Supreme Truth, satyam param. The mention of these two qualities together indicates that freedom from the tendency to devalue other beings (nirmatsara) is correlated with the vision to perceive the value (i.e., the Truth or underlying essence) of all beings (satām). Śrī Jiva Gosvāmi com- ments that nirmatsara also indicates compassion, especially in the sense of non-violence towards animals. 
Śrimad Bhagavatam propounds the topmost dharma because it teaches the means of attracting the most attractive person, Śrī Kṛṣṇa. 
892 
95 Śrimad Bhagavatam Is the Complete Scripture 
The only thing that attracts Śrī Kṛṣṇna is pure bhakti. The dharma described in Śrimad Bhagavatam, therefore, is love of Kṛṣṇa, śuddha- bhakti, which is completely devoid of all cheating propensities. 
The desire for liberation is also a type of cheating. The living being is part of Śrī Kṛṣṇa's energy, and thus rendering favorable ser- vice to Śrī Kṛṣṇa is natural. Any deviation from this natural func- tion is considered deception. The highest type of deceit is to deny the very existence of the Entity for whom such service is meant, by subscribing to the monistic view, whose one-dimensionality fails to account for inherent potency within the Supreme Transcendent. Except for pure devotional service, all other processes are marred by some amount of cheating. adt ind bran bos sa che edg 
There are three divisions of the Vedic literature, Karma-käṇḍa, Jñāna-kāṇḍa and Upāsanā-kāṇḍa. dto nolanami xd dwaleob 
Karma-kända deals with result-oriented action and the purifica- tion of action. It is meant for those whose self-identification is tied to the body-mind complex and to the entire network of physical and social relations that such identification entails. As long as the con- ventional self-sense prevails, attachment to sensual, emotional and mental gratification remains prominent. Karma-kända addresses this level of self-identity, emphasizing that harmony and well-being, even at the conventional level of existence, is possible only by assum- ing responsibility for the consequences of one's actions in accor- dance with universal laws. The karma perspective thus regulates unbridled desires for enjoyment that create imbalance and dishar- mony in the self-system, and hence, it gradually brings about the purification of desire and action.aders diavole home ballan 
Upāsanā-kāṇḍa deals with meditation and worship. It is intended for those whose sense of self encompasses more truth than the body- mind self. Although still rooted in a separate self sense, there is the intuition that self and cosmos are grounded within a greater reality. Upāsanā-kāṇḍa is relevant at this level of self-identity, emphasizing that value for the selflies in seeking out its connection with that real- ity through well-informed disciplines (i.e., meditation and worship) intended for that purpose. It teaches one to see everything as a man- ifestation of the Lord's energy, and thus allows the self-sense to be

Jñana-kända deals with Ultimate Reality, beyond the cosmos and the gunas of nature. It is intended for those who have seen through the separate-self sense altogether, at which point Karma-kända is no longer of relevance. Jñana-kända is applicable when the self-concept proceeds to the transcendental self, or atma. It refines awareness to strip away all the subtle layers of identification with the non- self, and trains one to recognize everything as Brahman, leading ultimately to realization of the unqualified Absolute. bounds a 
So, karma is intended for the body-mind self, upasana, for the higher sattvic self, and jñāna, for the transcendental self. Śrīmad Bhāgavatam transcends all three of these approaches, however, as it deals with the dimension of being beyond liberation. The transcen- dental self as defined by jñāna, is a mere stripping away of every- thing material. But Srimad Bhagavatam redefines the transcenden- tal self in its full potentiality, in relation to the Complete Whole, Bhagavan. As such, Bhagavatam bestows not only the respective results of the other three paths, but actualizes the highest poten- tial available to conscious beings, that of love for the Complete Per- son. It awards the highest bliss and completely uproots the three types of material miseries. Not only that, it completely shatters all ignorance, the cause behind all these miseries. Everyone is suffer- ing due to lack of awareness of the Supreme Lord, the conscious Source of our very existence. Śrimad Bhagavatam offers explicit knowledge and awareness of Bhagavan in abundance. Thus, it is called Srimad Bhagavatam - the beautiful treatise on Bhagavan, God as Transconventional Person.am w 965 
The book's name, Śrimad Bhagavatam, is also of great significance. Śrī indicates the energy of the Lord. The crude form śrimat is formed by applying the matup suffix, indicating a permanent connection or relation. This means that śrī is eternally available in Śrīmad Bhāga- vatam - it is not incidental or acquired. Just as fire has natural burn- ing potency, Śrimad Bhagavatam similarly has the natural potency to attract and reveal Śrī Kṛṣṇa. The implication is that if one recites or hears it even without understanding the meaning, it will manifest

its potency - provided the recipient has the required eligibility of honoring the value of all beings (nirmatsara). Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī says that Bhāgavatam is just like the Holy Name, which does not depend on any prior knowledge. 
Śrīmat is an equal part of the book's name, joined to the word bha- gavata as a karmadharaya compound. Just as "blue" in "blueberry" is significant in conveying the complete and specific sense of the word, śrīmat carries the identical type of significance as an equal member of a compound word. It is not a simple honorific, such as when one prefixes śrī to someone's name out of politeness or respect. To not regard it as part of the name would give rise to the rhetorical defect called avimṛṣṭa-vidheyamsa, which means, "putting the predi- cate before the subject." In a sentence the subject is the known, and the predicate supplies some information about the subject. 
602 
For example, if during a conversation John tells his friend, "Rama is a poet," then it is understood that the friend knows Rama, but does not know that he is a poet. In this sentence Rama is the sub- ject, and "is a poet" is the predicate. If, however, the predicate is placed before the subject, i.e., "A poet is Rama," then confusion is introduced, because when the friend first hears the word poet, he would not know to whom it refers. So, if śrīmat is not an equal part of the name, and yet one uses it to refer to the book, then one is putting the predicate before the subject. This is considered a defect because it delays comprehension of the sentence. 
The complete title of this work is thus Śrīmad Bhāgavatam, and Śrī Jiva confirms this with quotes from Garuda Purana as well as Śrīdhara Svāmi. As such, whenever it is referred to simply as Bhaă- gavatam, it should be understood that the word śrimat precedes it. Just as when Kṛṣṇa Dāsa Kavirāja is called simply "Kaviraja," it is understood that "Krsna Dasa" precedes it. 
Śrimad Bhagavatam is also great because its author is great. A product's quality depends upon the skill and competency of its pro- ducer. Here Śrī Jiva says that maha-muni refers to the Lord, who originally spoke Bhagavatam to Brahma, tene brahma hṛdā ya ādi-

? Śrīdhara Svāmī himself says that this refers to Nārāyaṇa.

kavaye (SB 1.1.1). The Lord is called the best of sages (rsīņām rṣab- hah) in SB 2.4.22, just as He is named maha-muni in SB 1.1.2. Also, while instructing Uddhava, Śrī Kṛṣṇa hinted at His being the orig- inal speaker of Bhagavatam: "Therefore, when the subsequent cre- ation took place, I spoke the Vedic knowledge to Brahma because I Myself am the religious principles in the Vedas" (SB 11.14.3). ads Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī cites an untraceable Vedic reference wherein the Lord is described as maha-muni. In Padma Purāṇa, Śrī Sūta Gosvāmi explicitly says: 
appstilog to tuo sman 
La Śrī Kṛṣṇa spoke the four seed-verses of Srimad Bhagavatam to 
Brahma through his heart when the latter was sitting on the lotush born out of the Lord's navel. These four verses are the embodiment of the Absolute Reality. (PP 6.194.68)" 
BOŚrī Jiva, however, on the basis of SB 12.13.19, also hints that Kṛṣṇa spoke the complete book. The verse says that the Lord revealed this (ayam) book to Brahma. The pronoun ayam refers to the com- plete book. Since the cycle of creation is beginningless, it is possible that at some time, the Lord revealed the four seed-verses of Śrīmad Bhāgavatam, and at another, the complete book. 
Therefore, Śrimad Bhagavatam is superior owing to the super- excellence of its author and speaker. Śrī Sūta Gosvāmī confirms this in Bhāgavata-māhātmya:

bO Śaunaka, after studying multitudinous scriptures, I have shared de with you the topmost secret. This is the essence of all scriptures. In

The word śuśruşubhiḥ in the verse under discussion is also very important. It means those who desire to hear Śrīmad Bhagavatam. The verse states that as soon as a person desires to hear this book, the Lord becomes situated in his or her heart. So it goes without saying that when the devotee actually engages in hearing, the Lord becomes totally bound up by him. The implication is that the topmost goal, which is not available through any other process even after it has been perfected, can be had merely by desiring to hear Śrīmad Bhā- gavatam. The words sadyas (immediately), and tat-kṣaṇāt (at that very moment), although they have the same meaning, have both been used to emphasize this fact. Therefore, one should not consider either of them as redundant or unnecessary repetition. Alterna- tively, sadyas can mean that by other processes the Lord may become momentarily captivated (i.e., in the "immediacy" of the moment), but when in contrast a person desires to hear Srimad Bhagavatam, the Lord remains steadfastly captivated from that very moment (tat- kṣaṇāt). 
Such a result is possible because Śrimad Bhagavatam is Śrī Kṛṣṇa's sabda-avatara. But to have this kind of experience, one must be a kṛti, or a virtuous person free from envy. 
In the following anuccheda, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī will explain how the original four seed-verses of Srimad Bhagavatam are also related specifically to Bhagavan and not to unqualified Brahman.

THIS EXCELLENCE OF SRIMAD BHAGAVATAM, by which it includes and surpasses the truth accessible through other paths, accords too with the experience of Śrī Śukadeva. Therefore, Bhagavan alone is the subject depicted in the four seed-verses of Bha- gavatam also. The Lord most certainly taught about Himself, while expounding direct knowledge concerning Him and three other topics related to Him. Before instructing the great devo- tee Brahma in His own scripture, named Srimad Bhagavatam, He first introduces the four primary subjects that will be found therein:

The Lord is saying, "Accept this knowledge, which is the ascer- tainment of the factual conclusions through words, as enunci- ated by Me, Bhagavan." The import of Krsna's statement is that no one else knows this truth, because it is supremely confiden- tial, embodying the highest mystery beyond even that of brahma- jñāna, as indicated in verses such as, "O great sage, among many millions who are liberated and perfected in knowledge of the self, one whose being is established in unalterable peace and who is fully devoted to Śrī Nārāyaṇa is most rare to find" (SB 6.14.5)2 
तच् च विज्ञानेन तदनुभावेनापि युक्तं गृहाण । न चैतावदेव किं च सरहस्यं तत्रापि रहस्यं यत् किमप्यस्ति तेनापि सहितम् । तच् च प्रेमभक्तिरूपमित्यग्रे व्यञ्जयिष्यते । तथा तदङ्गं च गृहाण । तच् च सति त्वपराधाख्यविघ्ने न झटिति विज्ञानरहस्ये प्रकटयेत् । तस्मात् तस्य ज्ञानस्य सहायं च गृहाणेत्यर्थः । तच् च श्रवणादिभक्तिरूपमित्यग्रे व्यञ्जयिष्यते । यद् वा सरहस्यमिति तदङ्गस्यैव विशेषणं ज्ञेयम् । सुहृदोरिव मिथः संवर्धकयोरेकत्रावस्थानात् । 
Accept this knowledge, together with its realization, vijñāna, which is included therein. Not only that, receive this knowl- edge along with its secret meaning, rahasya, which is embedded therein. This secret meaning is unalloyed devotion in uncon- ditional love, prema-bhakti, as will be revealed later on. More- over, accept also its component part (anga). This [knowledge alone] however, will not quickly disclose vijñāna and rahasya if obstructed by offences (aparādha). Therefore, accept also [the component part] which acts as a support for that knowledge. This support refers to devotional service [in the stage of practice] in the form of hearing and so on, as will be discussed further on. Or, the term sa-rahasya (with its mystery) is to be read as an adjec- tive of tad-anga (its component part), as they enhance each other and remain together like bosom friends.

Commentary we when biss fe from BE P 
RIFISH 
IN THE PREVIOUS SECTION, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi praised Srimad Bhā- gavatam because it establishes Bhagavan as inclusive of and tran- scending Brahman, because it directly attracts the Supreme Lord, and because the Lord originally spoke it. Sukadeva spoke Bhāga- vatam after his heart had been captivated by hearing just a few of its verses. His subsequent experience, which entailed shifting the context of already liberated awareness from Brahman realization to devotion to Bhagavan, has been cited as an indication of the superi- ority of Bhagavan over Brahman. So, it is certain that he, if anyone, realized the potency of Srimad Bhagavatam. This naturally implies that the four original seed-verses of Śrīmad Bhagavatam, which con- stitute its nucleus, present the conclusion that the highest poten- tiality of conscious beings culminates in pure devotional service to Bhagavan. This will now be discussed in the present anuccheda. 
At the beginning of creation, Śrī Brahma performed austeri- ties for one thousand celestial years. Pleased by this, Śrī Kṛṣṇa revealed to him His eternal abode. The Lord also appeared before him and instructed him in Catuḥ-sloki of Bhagavatam, the Bhāga- vatam condensed in four seed-verses. In fact, the Lord spoke seven verses in this section of Bhagavatam. In the first, He promises to instruct Brahma in four topics; in the second, He blesses him that he will attain complete knowledge about Himself. These two intro- ductory verses are followed by the four verses that comprise the Catuḥ-sloki proper, and finally the Lord blesses Brahma to remain fixed in His service in the seventh verse. The entire seven verses will be explained in this anuccheda. 
The Lord begins by naming the four items that He will describe: jñāna, vijñāna, rahasya and tad-anga. Jñāna means "discursive knowledge about the Supreme Lord;" vijñāna means “realized knowl- edge of the same;" rahasya means prema-bhakti; and tad-anga refers to sadhana-bhakti.

prema. If a person is free from offenses to the Holy Name, he can be awakened immediately to realization and prema-bhakti. But this is very rare. So, one must first cultivate knowledge about the Lord and engage in practical devotional service. By constant and sincere sadhana-bhakti, one is gradually freed from anarthas (addiction to all forms of non-truth) in the heart and progresses on the path of devotion. Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmi has presented a detailed analysis of this progression in BRS 1.4.14-15.

The phrase "in My utter completion" (yävän aham) means "to the full measure of My essential nature." "As I am in My exis- tence" (yatha-bhāva), means "My fundamental being or the char- acteristics that identify Me." In the phrase, "I am complete with form, attributes and action" (yad-rupa-guna-karmaka), the word "form" refers to forms such as those that are blackish or four- handed, all of which are within My essential nature; the word

"attributes" refers to "My attributes," such as affection for the devotees; and the word "action" refers to the "play (lila) enacted by Me in these various forms." "May true realization (tattva- vijñāna), or in other words, direct experience of Me as I am, as I exist complete with all these aforementioned aspects (tathaiva), dawn in you by My grace."

This verse thus automatically repudiates any interpretation of Catuḥ-sloki that claims that the Absolute is devoid of potency or attributes. Later on in Śrimad Bhagavatam, while speaking to Uddhava, Śrī Kṛṣṇa refers to Catuh-sloki as "the supreme knowledge that illuminates My glories" (SB 3.4.13). 
तत्त्वविज्ञानपदेन रूपादीनामपि स्वरूपभूतत्वं व्यक्तम् । अत्र विज्ञानाशीः स्पष्टा रहस्याशीश्च परमानन्दात्मकतत्तद्याथार्थ्यानुभवेनावश्यं प्रेमोदयात् । 
The compound word tattva-vijñāna indicates that the Lord's form and so on are part of His essential nature. In this verse, the Lord's blessings for direct realization are explicit. The blessing for rahasya is also present, since prema would certainly arise through the factual experience of all these features, which are supremely blissful in nature. 
Commentary 
It is not possible to understand Bhagavan without receiving His blessings, so the Lord blesses Brahma in the second verse of Catuḥ- śloki. Śrīla Viśvanatha Cakravarti Thakura says that yävän refers to the highly appropriate arrangement of the Lord's limbs as well as the qualities of their shape, such as stoutness, slenderness, length, height and so on. Yatha-bhāva refers to Bhagavan's intentional- ity, and yad-rupa-guna-karmaka refers to His various forms, such

96 The Conclusion of the Catuh-sloki of Bhāgavatam Is Bhagavan 
as those that are four-handed, two-handed, or half-man half-lion; qualities, like mercy; and actions, like lifting Govardhana Hill. 
That all this was revealed to Brahma by the Lord's mercy com- pletely uproots any possibility that the purpose of Catuḥ-sloki is to establish Brahman as the ultimate Absolute Reality. The Radical Nondualist interpretation of the four verses cannot be reconciled with the present verse, because for them Brahman has no rūpa, guna or karma. Bhagavan is a person, and He revealed His personhood to Brahma, who is also a person distinct from the Supreme Lord. 
In this verse, tattva-vijñāna refers to Bhagavan's personal form and not to Brahman, because of its being used in connection with rupa, guna and karma. Śrī Jiva confirms this by quoting a verse spo- ken by Uddhava in the Third Canto, wherein he quotes the words Kṛṣṇa spoke to him when the two met just before the Lord's return to His own abode: 
[I shall now speak to you] that supreme knowledge, which illumi- nates My glory, which the sages call Bhāgavatam, and which I taught 30to the unborn Brahma while he was still seated on My navel lotus at 
the dawn of creation. (SB 3.4.13)5 
O The point is that Śrī Kṛṣṇa imparted the same knowledge to Uddhava that He had given to Brahmā, as Uddhava himself stated to Vidura when the two met in Vrindavan. Specifically, Uddhava was referring to the teachings that Kṛṣṇa gave him in the Eleventh Canto. With the words, "which illuminates My glory" (man- mahimavabhāsa), it is clear that this knowledge is related to Śrī Kṛṣṇa and not to Brahman. This is confirmed later when Vidura also asked Uddhava to relate the same teaching to him. In his words, this teaching is the "supreme knowledge, which reveals the secret of His own being" (jñānam paraṁ svātma-rahaḥ-prakāśam, SB 3.4.25). 
In the principal verse under discussion, the blessing that the Lord offered to Brahma for realization (vijñāna) is explicit, but there is no explicit benediction to experience the rahasya. Nevertheless, Śrī Jiva argues that such a blessing is implicit because any realization

(vijñāna) of the Lord and His energies, i.e., of His internal nature, would automatically lead a person to prema. In fact, that is the real purpose behind the Lord's offering vijñāna.

In this way, the Lord delineates the four topics under investiga- tion in the four verses of Catuḥ-sloki. He begins by defining Him- self in [the first] two verses to elucidate jñāna and vijñāna. In the matter of jñāna, He says: 
अहमेवासमेवाग्रे नान्यद् यत् सदसत्परम् । 
पश्चादहं यदेतच् च योऽवशिष्येत सोऽस्म्यहम् ॥ ४४३ ।।

In the beginning, I alone certainly did exist, and no other, whether sat, asat or beyond both. Afterwards, I am, for both this cosmos and what remains are also I. (SB 2.9.32)" 
अत्राहंशब्देन तद्वक्ता मूर्त एवोच्यते न तु निर्विशेषं ब्रह्म तदविषयत्वात् । आत्मज्ञानतात्प- र्यके तु “तत्त्वमसि” (छा० ६।८।७) इतिवत् त्वमेवासीः एव वक्तुमुपयुक्तत्वात् । 
तु 
In this verse, the word aham (1) indicates that the speaker must have a form and cannot be the attributeless Brahman, since the latter cannot be denoted by a personal pronoun. If the intent of the verse was to convey atma-jñāna, knowledge of the iden- tity of the self with Brahman, as in the statement "Thou art that" (CHU 6.8.7), it would have been more appropriate to say "You alone were [...]." 
Sat and asat have been left untranslated as Sridhara Svāmī and Śrī Jiva differ in their interpretations. Śrīdhara Svāmī takes sat to mean "the gross," asat "thet subtle," and "that which is beyond both" to be "their cause, the pradhana." Jiva Gosvāmi's interpretation is given below.

Therefore, the meaning should be understood as follows: "I am this supremely captivating form, which has appeared before you at this present moment, and I exist as such even prior to creation, i.e., even during the interim period of the cosmic cataclysm." This is confirmed in the Śrutis such as, "In the beginning there was only Vasudeva, and no Brahma or Sankara. In the begin- ning there was only Nārāyaṇa, not Brahma nor Śiva" (Mahā Upanisad 1). 
“भगवानेक आसेदमग्र आत्मात्मनां विभुः” (भा० ३।५।२३) इत्यादितृतीयात् । 
In the Third Canto, Maitreya Muni states, "Bhagavan, the Self of all selves, the Supreme Lord, alone existed in the beginning" (SB 3.5.23). 
अतो वैकुण्ठतत्पार्षदादीनामपि तदुपाङ्गत्वादहम्पदेनैव ग्रहणं “राजासौ प्रयाति” इतिवत् । ततस्तेषां च तद्वदेव स्थितिर्बोध्यते । 
Owing to being His parts, the Vaikuntha planets, His associates and other aspects of His internal potency, are all included in the word "I," just as when one says, "The king is passing by," the pres- ence of the king's retinue is also implied. Therefore, all these asso- ciated elements should be understood as belonging to the exact same category as Bhagavan.

Alternatively, the words asam eva, taken in the sense of, "I sim- ply existed," are meant to negate the existence of other actions, such as creation, which are perceptible to persons, like Brahmā, who are outside the sphere of His internal nature. Hence, these words do not negate the pastimes that belong to His own inter- nal potency. For example, when it is said, "Today the king is not doing anything," only his royal duties are being denied, and not his personal activities, like sleeping, eating and so on. This state- ment is to be understood in the same way. Another possibility is to consider the verb asam as being formed from [another verbal root] vas, which means "to go," "to shine," or "to accept."1* In this case, the meaning would be, "Prior to creation, I certainly did also exist [or shine], resplendent with the very attributes [like form and so on] that you are seeing now." With this statement, the Lord specifically negates the concept that the Absolute is formless, and other relativistic theories.

The Lord addresses this objection with the words, "[...] and no other, whether sat, asat or beyond both" (nanyad yat sad-asat- param, SB 2.9.32). Sat means the effect, and asat, the cause. Brah- man, which is beyond these two, is not anything other than Me. In other words, the intention here is this: "Sometimes there is an incapacity to ascertain the unique attributes inherent in My essential nature (svarupa), either on the part of the aspirant [whose eligibility is for Brahman realization alone], or on the part of the scripture [which discloses the Absolute as no more than the negation of all material attributes]. In either of these cases, the pre-existing Truth, which verily I am, appears to have no attributes."nisd to lost on yd beriem jan al noninhob aim

Alternatively, scriptures offer two different descriptions: one is of the Absolute as undifferentiated consciousness, without mani- fest qualities, because at the time of cosmic annihilation, there is a complete absence of phenomena; the other description is of Bha- gavan, complete with inherent potency and characteristics, and existing in the transcendental abode of Vaikuntha.

From the above it is concluded that the knowledge spoken of in the verse under discussion [SB 2.9.32] specifically relates to the complete Absolute, Bhagavan, as He is understood from the Gitā verse examined earlier [Section 93], "I am the basis of Brahman." It is for this reason that this knowledge was declared to be the most confidential [in SB 2.9.30].

The Lord answers, "Afterwards (paścät), i.e., even at the termina- tion of the creation cycle, I alone am (aham), which is to say that I most certainly do exist at that time both in My form as Bhagavan, present in the Vaikuntha planets, and as the Supreme Indwelling Self, immanent within phenomenal existence." This completes the intended sense. From this it is evident that the knowledge that has been instructed is specifically about Bhagavan, such as that described in verses like, "The Lord is the source of the cre- ation, maintenance and dissolution of the cosmos, but He Himself is without cause" (SB 11.3.35)."

A further doubt is raised: "But surely all the forms that one sees all around, like those made of clay or cloth, are not Your forms, and You can therefore be said to be incomplete."

Also in verses such as the previous one, it is knowledge of Bhaga- van that is expounded. Thus, by showing that He is ever unfrag- mented by time or space, the Lord has instructed Śrī Brahma about Himself "to the fullest extent" (yävän aham, SB 2.9.31), just as He earlier promised that He would, out of His own mercy. In the same way, by the words "and no other, whether sat, asat or beyond both" (SB 2.9.32), He instructed Brahma that He is the ulti- mate truth, "exactly as He is in His own existence" (yatha-bhāva), a fact indicated by the statement, "I am the support of Brahman" (GĪTĀ 14.27).

By giving Brahmä knowledge of the fact that He is inclusive of unlimited unique forms, He instructed Brahma that He, in His own existence, is complete with form (yad-rupa). This He did by indicating that His form as Bhagavan is the Whole that con- tains all other forms. By giving Brahma knowledge of the fact that He encompasses unlimited unique attributes, He instructed him that He, in His own existence, is complete with attributes (yad-guna). This He did by indicating that His form as Bhaga- van is the support for everything. Finally, by giving Brahmā knowledge of the fact that unlimited supramundane acts flow from Him, He instructed him that He, in His own existence, is complete with action (yat-karma). This He did by telling him that He is the shelter of innumerable actions, beginning with the creation, maintenance and dissolution of the cosmos. V

Commentary 
Śrī Bhagavat Sandarbha meno cer 
wood nosa baarion 
In the main verse of this subsection (SB 2.9.32), the Lord instructs Brahma in the first of the four topics, namely jñāna, or knowledge of the Absolute. He emphatically states that He existed as He is (as a transconventional person) before the creation, that He exists now while instructing Brahma, and that He will continue to exist after annihilation. The personal pronoun aham (I), indicates personhood. This verse thus completely denies that there is any ultimate reality beyond Bhagavan.in n 
The material world undergoes repeated cycles of creation and annihilation, but the Lord and His abode exist eternally. When the Lord says that He existed before the creation, it means that His abode along with His associates also did as well. Hasylska" dun bat 
When we say that the President lives in the White House, it is understood that he lives there along with his family, servants, body- guards and so on. Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī cites many references from Śruti and Smrti to prove that the Lord exists as a person, along with His abode and associates, before the material creation. Thus, the claim of the Advaitavādīs that Brahman is the Ultimate Reality is countered. Statements that describe the oneness of the living being and Brahman are not to be taken in an absolute sense. They indicate the spiritual nature of the jiva and are the primary canons in spiri- tual understanding. This was discussed in detail in Tattva Sandarbha, Anucchedas 43-44-rol del wig molded artist 
If the Lord's intention was to establish unqualified Brahman, which is Oneness of being only devoid of potency or distinction, as the supreme reality, it would have been more appropriate for Him to say, "O Brahma, it is you alone, as Brahman, that existed before creation, when there was nothing other than Brahman. What you see now is also Brahman, nondifferent from you, and after annihi- lation what remains will also be you, Brahman. There is no other reality besides you." 
When the Lord says that He existed prior to creation, it does not mean that He simply existed, without any variety, action or attributes. It means that He was engaged in action, or play (līlā), 
912 
96 The Conclusion of the Catuḥ-sloki of Bhāgavatam Is Bhagavān 
related to His internal potencies. This material world can be compared to the Lord's office and the internal energy to His home. His home is His permanent residence and therefore never destroyed, whereas His office undergoes cycles of change, just as people living in the same home may change offices. When it is said that the Presi- dent is not working, it means that he is not doing official work, but this does not mean that he has stopped engaging in family affairs or recreational activities at home. The inadequacy of this example lies in the fact that the Lord can be simultaneously both at home and at the office. 
Since the indeclinable eva (only) appears after aham (I), it rules out the possibility that the ultimate truth being spoken of could refer to anyone else (anya-yoga-vyavaccheda), or to impersonal Brahman. The same word eva is used as an emphatic particle after asam (past tense of the verb "to be"), giving the sense, "Certainly I existed prior to creation." 
This usage rules out any possibility of His non-existence (atyanta- ayoga-vyavaccheda). It also rules out the possibility of His actions being material, because nothing material existed at that time. 
Moreover, the verb asam is the past tense of the verbal root √as. There are two verbal roots √as, one means "to be" and the other means "to go," "take," or "shine." Therefore, asam could mean "was," "went," "took" or "shone." If the last meaning is taken, it would sig- nify that the Lord shone during annihilation, which means that He shone among His associates, or through His actions, or because of His brilliant beauty. This again eliminates the possibility of Brah- man, Time, prakṛti or anything else being the ultimate source behind 
creation. 
The Lord glanced at material nature, thus He existed before glancing. Time is insentient and thus cannot be considered sup- reme. Furthermore, Brahman, which is beyond cause and effect, is not independent of the Lord - nanyad yat sad-asat-param. This is confirmed by Śrī Kṛṣṇa in Bhagavad Gitā:

Mukta-phala is a book compiled by a great Advaitavada scholar, Vopadeva. It is a selection of about 800 verses, all cited from Śrīmad Bhāgavatam, with the purpose of showing that bhakti to Śrī Viṣṇu should be adopted as a means of spiritual realization. Only the intro- ductory and concluding verses were written by the compiler. The book was commented on by another great scholar, Hemādri, who was Vopadeva's contemporary and friend. The book's first division, which contains four chapters, is called Vişnu-prakaraṇa. It contains discussions on the divine form, distinctive character and exalted position of Visņu, His being worshipable, and a description of the 
various avatāras. 
The first verse of Visnu-prakarana is the one under discussion here. Before citing this verse, Vopadeva says, "The characteristics of Śrī Vişņu and various divisions of His manifestations [are described] there" (tatra vişnor lakṣaṇam bhedaś ca). Therefore, although an advocate of the unqualified Absolute, Vopadeva also acknowledged that this verse specifies the characteristics of Śrī Vişņu and not of Brahman. While commenting, Hemadri writes, "The words 'I alone' (aham eva) negate any other agent besides the speaker" (aham eveti kartr-antarasya vyavṛttih).te

This verse was explained earlier [Anuccheda 18]. The concise meaning is this: "Artha, or the 'underlying essential Reality,' here refers to Me, the Ultimate of all that is attainable by con- scious beings (puruṣārtha). Whatever is perceived in exclusion of Me, or in other words, in the absence of the perception of Me, and furthermore whatever is not perceived within the Self (ātmani), i.e., that does not manifest of its own without Me, one should know that substance (vastu) to be My, the Supreme Controller's, māyā."

The examples given for this maya are abhasa (reflected light) and tamas (darkness). The resemblance of abhāsa to māyā is clear. Darkness is also experienced outside the perception of light; yet at the same time, it cannot be perceived without the eye, which is an embodiment of light.

The import of the verb vidyat (one should know), being conju- gated in the third person is as follows: This teaching is indeed meant only for others, whereas you, Brahmā, are [already] expe- riencing it directly through the power granted by Me. In this way, only by transcending mayika perception [each and every act of perception that is devoid of truth visioning], can one realize Me, who am complete with qualities such as form.

The purpose of apprehending the truth in terms of what it is not (vyatireka) is this: Even after ascertaining My essential nature and so on [conceptually] through the medium of revealed sound, one cannot realize them directly as long as one is identified with the evolutes of māyā. Thus, to awaken such vision, one must pur- posefully let go of māyā. From this, it can be understood that the Lord also induced Brahma to experience love for Him, because it is inherent in His nature [lit., because the absence of prema is completely absent in Him].

The elaborate meaning of this verse, which defines māyā (SB 2.9.33), was previously presented in Anuccheda 18. To realize the Lord, one has to become free from the influence of māyā, and in order to do this, one has to know māyā. If one has interest in an object, whether to attain it or overcome it, one has to know it thoroughly. For this pur- pose, the Lord offers this explanation. Once one is free from māyā, prema becomes a possibility.

Here Jiva reads the verse differently from Śrīdhara Svāmi, whose commentary we have followed in the original translation. Jīva has joined na and teşu to form one word, nateşu, which is glossed as "surrendered souls" (pranata-janesu). He takes the word teşu (those) to be a demonstrative adjective, glossed as "known for their virtues," instead of as a demonstrative pronoun referring back to bhüteşu in the first part of the verse, which is the usual way of reading it. Jiva will defend his reading below.

The cosmic elements both enter and do not enter all objects, yet when they enter, they do so by fragmentation, whereas the Lord's pervasion or non-pervasion is accomplished through His dif- ferent direct expansions. Thus, although there is a difference between the two, the comparison is still valid on the basis of the similarity of entry and non-entry. canola mill bol amary dire

96 The Conclusion of the Catuḥ-sloki of Bhagavatam Is Bhagavān 
अचिन्त्यगुणस्वरूपमपि प्रेमाख्यं यदञ्जनं तेन च्छुरितवतुच्चैः प्रकाशमानं भक्तिरूपं विलो- चनं तेनेत्यर्थः “ये भजन्ति तु मां भक्त्या मयि ते तेषु चाप्यहम् ” (गीता ९।२९) इति गीतोप- निषदश्च ad 
। 
The meaning here is that even though the Lord's form contains inconceivable attributes, [the devotees are able to see Him] with the eye of devotion, which has been anointed or made clear with the salve known as love. In Gītā Upaniṣad also Śrī Kṛṣṇa states, "Those who worship Me through devotion are situated in Me, and I too am established in them" (GĪTĀ 9.29).26 
यद् वा तेषु यथा तानि बहिःस्थितानि चान्तः स्थितानि च भान्ति तद्वत् भक्तेष्वहमन्तर्मनोवृ- त्तिषु बहिरिन्द्रियवृत्तिषु च विस्फुरामीति च । भक्तेषु सर्वथाऽनन्यवृत्तिताहेतुर्नाम किमपि स्वप्रकाशं प्रेमाख्यमानन्दात्मकं वस्तु मम रहस्यमिति व्यञ्जितम् । 
Alternatively, an implied meaning [in the verse of Catuh-sloki ] is, "Just as the cosmic elements appear outside the living beings as well as inside them, I similarly appear both within the minds as well as in the external senses of My devotees. In other words, the cause behind the devotees having no object other than Me in their thoughts or actions is a self-luminous substance, blissful in nature, called prema. This substance is My rahasya, or secret." 
तथैव श्रीब्रह्मणोक्तम् (भा० २।६।३३) - 
Śri Brahma has similarly stated: 
न भारती मेऽङ्ग मृषोपलक्ष्यते न वै क्वचिन् मे मनसो मृषा गतिः ।

Never can my speech be said to be deceitful, nor the movements al of my mind to be invalid; nor do my senses ever fall on the path of bimpermanence, for, my dear son, I hold Śri Hari within my heart 
with great yearning. (SB 2.6.33)27

Although the aforementioned interpretation of this verse can be contradicted by supplying another, this is its true import, since it comes in the context of the Lord's intent of fulfilling four propositions, and because it appears at the appropriate point in the sequence. Moreover, taking the word nateşu as two separate words, “not in them ” ( na tesu) as other commentators do, serves no purpose, since the example must be appropriately associated with the two verbs (entering and not entering). 
किं च तस्मिन्नर्थे न तेषु इति छिन्नपदमपि व्यर्थं स्यात् दृष्टान्तस्यैव क्रियाभ्यामन्वयोपपत्तेः । अपि च रहस्यं नाम ह्येतदेव यत् परमदुर्लभं वस्तु दुष्टोदासीनजनदृष्टिनिवारणार्थं साधारण- वस्त्वन्तरेणाच्छाद्यते यथा चिन्तामणिः सम्पुटादिना । अत एव “परोक्षवादा ऋषयः परोक्षं च मम प्रियम्” (भा० ११ । २१ । ३५) इति श्रीभगवद्वाक्यं च ।

Furthermore, the concept of confidentiality (rahasyatva) is truly fulfilled here, for that indeed is called rahasya which is most rare and is hidden away from miscreants and indifferent people by covering it with another, ordinary object, just as a precious jewel is kept hidden in a box. For, as the Lord says, "The Vedic seers keep their meaning out of sight (parokṣa-vādāḥ), and I am pleased by such hidden explanations" (SB 11.21.35)28.

Kṛṣṇa Himself has also stated this directly to His great devo- tees Arjuna and Uddhava in verses like, "Hear once more My supreme words, which are most confidential" (GĪTĀ 18.64),30 and, "Although it is to be kept most hidden, I shall speak it to you" (SB 11.11.49).31 Indeed, Śrī Brahma revealed this very secret, rahasya, to Narada by saying: 
इदं भागवतं नाम यन् मे भगवतोदितम् । सङ्गोऽयं विभूतीनां त्वमेतद् विपुलीकुरु ॥ ४५४ ।। यथा हरौ भगवति नृणां भक्तिर्भविष्यति । 
सर्वात्मन्यखिलाधारे इति सङ्कल्प्य वर्णय ॥ ४५५ ।। इति । 
O Narada, this text named Srimad Bhagavatam, which was spo- ken to me by Bhagavan, describes in brief the glories of the Lord. Now, you please elaborate on it. Describe it with the intention that people may develop devotion to Śri Hari, the immanent Self of all beings and the support of all. (SB 2.7.51-52)32 
तस्मात् साधु व्याख्यातं स्वामिचरणैरपि “रहस्यं भक्तिः” (भा० दी० २।९।३१) इति । 
Therefore, Śrīdhara Svāmi has also correctly explained (Bha- vārtha-dipikā 2.9.31) that rahasya means devotional service (rahasyam bhaktiḥ).

This verse of Catuḥ-sloki (SB 2.9.34) explains rahasya, which is the topmost secret and can therefore only be explained indirectly. 
Although the Lord is situated in His own abode, He expands to sit in the heart of His loving devotees. He explained this to Durvāsā Muni:

niveda Barane Śrī Bhagavat Sandarbha 
True devotees are My heart, and I too am the heart of true devotees. They do not know anything other than Me, and I know nothing at all other than them. (SB 9.4.68)33om ons dahiw abrow m 
The material elements exist outside of material objects as well as within them. It is not that the totality of the material elements is used up in the making of material objects. Similarly, Bhagavan exists in His own abode as well as within His devotees. Bhagavan, however, has the ability to expand Himself into plenary portions. This is the difference between the material elements and Bhagavan. 
Another meaning to be understood from this verse is that Bhaga- vän exists both within and outside His devotees, because of His love for them. The yogis, on the other hand, see only the Lord's expansion as Paramātmā within, because they have awareness of the Lord only, devoid of specific feelings of love. 
Any other interpretation of this verse would not be in accord with the Lord's propositions as given in the first verse quoted in this section. The mystery is prema, not Brahman. It is prema that is espe- cially rare, and which the Lord does not easily bestow. He awards Brahman realization even to the enemies whom He kills. Therefore, Brahman cannot be considered the rahasya referred to in the first verse. Thus, Śrīdhara Svami has rightly translated rahasya as bhakti. Śrī Kṛṣṇa told Uddhava that bhakti is the most confidential secret: 
My dear Uddhava, O beloved of the Yadu dynasty, listen now to this supreme mystery. Although it is to be kept carefully hidden, I shall speak it to you because you are My servant, well-wisher and friend. (SB 11.11.49)34 bonials ad vino solo mas be toned fromgol

The word etat in this verse refers to bhakti-yoga, which was men- tioned in the preceding verse. Bhakti or prema is said to be highly confidential because most people are ineligible to receive it. People in general are powerfully identified with the external potency in the

form of the body-mind complex and the world. As long as such iden- tification remains prominent, consciousness is unable to perceive, receive or enter into the internal potency in the form of unalloyed devotion. The Lord does not award bhakti to those thus identified, lest they misuse it. He therefore speaks with indirect words so that only those who are qualified will recognize the concealed truth. 
Śrī Brahma ordered Narada Muni [in SB 2.7.51-52] to narrate the four-verse Śrimad Bhagavatam in such a way that those who heard it would attain devotion to Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Vyasa Deva had the same experience after Narada Muni instructed him in Śrīmad Bhāgavatam: 
starwelter 
In one who hears this Śrīmad Bhagavatam arises devotion to Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Person, putting an end to all of one's mourning, bewil- derment and fear. (SB 1.7.7) 35 
Therefore, according to Brahma, Narada and Vyasa, and from the personal experience of Sukadeva Gosvāmi, it is clear that the central theme of Srimad Bhagavatam is pure devotion to the Lord. As such, this verse (SB 2.9.34) cannot apply to unqualified Brahman, as some would have it. 
Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī raises two objections to any such interpreta- tion: it is not in keeping with the propositions of the Lord found in SB 2.9.30, nor can it be reconciled with His blessings in SB 2.9.31. 
Normally, the impersonal interpretation of the verse is based on the reading of the word nateşu (in the surrendered) as two words na teşu (not in them). The understanding is that just as the mate- rial elements are both outside as well as inside phenomenal objects, Brahman is similarly both inside and outside the living being. This meaning, however, is derived simply from the words tathā teṣu, in connection with the verbs praviṣṭāni (enter) and apraviṣṭāni (do not enter). Hence, by this rendering, the rest of the line (na teşu) is made completely redundant. Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi avoids this problem by saying that it is but one word referring to the devotees (nata, mean- ing "bowed down," or "surrendered"). Because devotees are full of

love for the Lord, they see Him both within the heart and externally, with senses transmuted through pervasion of the internal potency. This is confirmed by Brahma-samhita 5.38, where Brahma says, "They see within the heart also" (hrdaye'pi vilokayanti). The word api (also) indicates that they perceive Him not only within the heart, but out- side as well with their external senses. This state of being, or this state of awareness, in which one directly perceives the Lord in every- thing, both internally and externally, is the mystery referred to as prema. 
The Śrutis hinted at by Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī are ones such as the following: 
bett 
96.6 
A person desiring liberation must take shelter of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the Lord who illuminates everyone's mind and intelligence. He created Brahma at the dawn of creation, instructed him in the knowledge of Srimad Bhagavatam and made him sing it. (GTU 1.26)36

swball 
Thereafter, should Brahma ask Him how such a rahasya could be brought into manifestation, the Lord instructs him in the means of attaining it, which is itself a component part of that mystery (tad-anga); and since this process is meant for attaining the rahasya, as is made clear from the sequence in which the sub- jects were presented [given in SB 2.9.30 above], He also specifies it as a confidential truth [i.e., in an indirect manner]:

96 The Conclusion of the Catuḥ-śloki of Bhāgavatam Is Bhagavan 
One who is inquisitive to know the truth of the Self should inquire all the way up to this very point (the rahasya), both through direct (anvaya) and indirect (vyatireka) means," so that it may be [experienced] everywhere and always. (SB 2.9.35)38 
आत्मनो मम भगवतस्तत्त्वजिज्ञासुना प्रेमरूपं याथार्थ्यं रहस्यमनुभवितुमिच्छुना एतावदेव जिज्ञास्यं श्रीगुरुचरणेभ्यः शिक्षणीयम् । 
roris daidvent (queno) noitam The phrase "of the Self" (atmanah) means of Me, the Supreme Lord. "One who is inquisitive to know the truth" (tattva- jijñāsuna) refers to one who wishes to experience the true mys- tery in the form of love of God. The phrase, "Inquiry should be made all the way up to this very point" (etavad eva jijñāsyam), means that one should receive instruction in this matter from a spiritual teacher.

37 "A cause, or hetu, is said to be connected with its effects by anvaya-vyatireka-vyapti 
when both the affirmative and negative relationship between the thing to be proved and the cause that proves it can be equally asserted. Such a hetu alone makes the argument perfectly sound and incapable of refutation. The process of arriving at the vyapti, or universal proposition, corresponds to the methods of Agreement and Difference in Mill's logic." (Apte 1998, p. 93) 
But it should be noted that some vyapti are only anvayi, i.e., have only a positive relation, and some are only vyatireki, i.e., have only a negative relation.

Therefore, this great Purana is also called Srimad Bhagavatam, or that which relates to or is spoken by Śrī Bhagavan. Śrī Śuka simi- larly says, "I meditate upon that pure and spotless, immortal Sup- reme Absolute Truth (param satyam), free of lamentation, who in the beginning personally revealed this incomparable torch- light of knowledge to Śrī Brahma" (SB 12.13.19).44 Here the term para (supreme) indicates that the speaker [i.e., the revealer of the knowledge] was Bhagavan, because the difference [between Bhagavan and His plenary portion] has been pointed out in the Second Canto: "The Purusa (Karaṇodakaśāyi Viṣṇu) is the first avatara of the Supreme Lord (parasya)" (SB 2.6.41).45

In the final verse of Catuḥ-sloki (SB 2.9.35), the Lord discloses sadhana-bhakti, which is the component part of the mystery of prema. Sadhana is the process of inquiry or investigation into the nature of Absolute Reality. This investigation is not an intellectual inquiry, yet it includes the faculty of mind. It is a consummate investigation that involves the totality of being, awareness, feeling, intention, thought, perception and action. Such an investigation can stop short at various points, without reaching the ultimate limit of inquiry. 
For example, one may inquire up to the point of realizing God as the world, as psychic phenomena, as immanence pervading the world or nature, as the creator God, as emptiness in the form of nirvana, as transcendence in the form of Brahman, or as Bhagavan, the complete personal nondual Whole. All of these perspectives have their range of validity, but unless inquiry is pushed to its ultimate limit, one's view remains partial. Hence, this verse states that one's investigation, or in other words, one's sadhana must extend all the way to the mystery of prema; otherwise, that mystery remains a mys- tery. So, that sadhana that extends all the way to the ultimate limit of prema is itself the component part of the total mystery of prema. 
Because this investigation is a self-transcending process, it cannot be undertaken independently by a separated self, caught in various degrees of identification with the body-mind complex. 
928 
96 The Conclusion of the Catuḥ-sloki of Bhagavatam Is Bhagavān 
Otherwise, whatever is discovered will necessarily be interpreted with reference to the conditioned self-concept. For this reason, Jiva Gosvāmi says that this investigation involves submission of being to a spiritual teacher who stands in the glory of the ultimate mystery of prema. 
Often times when a spiritual teacher offers confidential knowl- edge, the disciple does not realize its significance. The teacher has to break through the student's layers of self-identification, and the corresponding layers of misinterpretation of the teaching, in order that the true significance of his words can be decisively and experi- entially grasped. The rahasya is therefore understood only by hear- ing from a realized teacher. The Lord says that it is specifically prema that is to be understood as the final intention of all scriptural rules and regulations. This means that prema is the ultimate pur- pose and the highest teaching described in the scriptures. If one has not understood this, his or her education is incomplete. This is the culmination of all subjects to be learned from a spiritual teacher. 
Even in the material world, it is seen that everyone is hankering for love, even though they may not understand or acknowledge it clearly. Everyone looks for someone or something in which to repose his or her love. If a person is unable to love another person, he may choose to love a pet or even an insentient object. Life without love is drudgery. This means that life is meant specifically for love, and the love that offers complete fulfillment and grants access to the highest potential of the conscious being is love of God. 
Without love, one's growth remains stunted. For the sake of love, a person can sacrifice even his own life or most precious possession. This means that love is superior to self-satisfaction. If this is the case even in regard to conventional love in the material world, then how much more must it be so in the spiritual world - where love of God is far superior even to the bliss of self-realization. Śrīmad Bhāgavatam was spoken to confer prema. Śrī Caitanya appeared simply to deliver the message of prema. Sat Sandarbhas were composed to disseminate the teaching of prema given by Śrī Caitanya. 
Srimad Bhagavatam was spoken by Bhagavan Śrī Kṛṣṇa and not by His expansion Nārāyaṇa or Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu. Therefore, it

It is God in His ultimacy alone that is to be searched out from all the Vedas. The Vedas do not concern themselves with the popu-g olarization of any other [minor gods or partial truth]. Therefore, 
after studying all the Vedas and deliberating upon them, a person yearning for liberation should aspire to know only Him!

AS DEMONSTRATED IN THE LAST TWO SECTIONS, Śrīmad Bhāga- vatam establishes that Bhagavan is the Ultimate Reality and that Brahman is His incomplete manifestation. In this anuccheda, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi declares that the purpose of all the Vedas and Vedic literature is similarly to point to the Reality that is Bhagavan. Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi gives numerous scriptural references to show how, directly or indirectly, all scriptures describe Bhagavan. This is cer- tainly logical. If there is only one Absolute Reality, as confirmed by the experience of those who have realized the Absolute, then the purpose of all revealed scriptures is not to propose many truths, but to explain the one Absolute Reality from different angles of vision. They should all be reconciled in that one Reality. 
All scriptures can be reconciled only if the synthesis at which they aim is in fact the Absolute in its highest completion. Any partial understanding of the Absolute is incapable of providing such a syn- thesis. It is for this reason that the synthesis of all scriptures is said to be in Bhagavan alone, because He is the all-inclusive Complete Whole, including and transcending even Brahman. This means that if one studies all the Vedas, Purānas and Itihasas, it is possible to har- monize the different statements, only if Bhagavan is understood as the subject matter. Otherwise, there appear to be so many contra- dictions in the scriptures. Different topics are described in various scriptures to provide appropriate view and path for people at differ- ent levels of self-identification and belief. Their ultimate purpose, however, is to explain Bhagavan. Thus, the Hari-vamsa states: 
ald In the Veda, Rāmāyaṇa, Purāṇas and Mahabharata, it is Śrī Hariq) galalone who is glorified everywhere, whether in the beginning, then 
middle or the end. (Hari-vaṁśa Purana 3.132.95)13 M most stazase z

The real source of this verse in this form seems to be Madhva's bhāṣya to GITA 2.43. The Mahabharata reference is given as Svarga-parva 6.13, and yet there is no such verse in any edition, as Svargārohaṇa-parva contains only five chapters. No reading in the critical edition (Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute 1987)

97 All Scriptures Are Reconciled in Bhagavan 
Samanvaya, or synthesis, means to reach a conclusion by recon- ciling the various scriptures according to the following six maxims: 
The true purport of a text can be decided by these six criteria: (1) what is stated at the beginning and at the end; (2) what is repeated throughout the text; (3) what is original to it; (4) what is ascer- tained to be the result; (5) what is praised; and (6) what is estab- lished by logical argument." 
By following this method of analysis, it is found that it is Bha- gavān alone who is glorified in all the Vedic literature. This is the purport of the verse from Hari-vamsa Purana. Srimad Bhagavatam is the essence of all the Vedas and Itihāsas. Furthermore, it is the nat- ural commentary to Vedanta-sutra and reveals the true meaning of Mahābhārata. 
bool vroat JA OR 
Bhāgavatam, which has the above characteristics, describes Bha- gavān alone as Supreme. It follows from this that the subject of all Vedic scriptures is Bhagavan; otherwise, their essence, which is described in Śrimad Bhagavatam, could not be Bhagavan. The essence of all kinds of milk is butter, because butter permeates all milk. Therefore, Śrī Sūta Gosvāmī also said, "The Vedas aim at Śrī Kṛṣṇa" (vasudeva-parā vedāḥ, SB 1.2.28). 
This is confirmed in Vedanta-sutra, which summarizes the con- clusion of all the Upanisads, which in turn contain the essence of the Vedas: "But Bhagavan is the subject of all the Vedas, because such is the harmonization of all such literature" (tat tu samanvayat, VS 1.1.4). Part of Śripada Baladeva Vidyabhuṣaṇa's comment on this sutra can be paraphrased as follows: 
If one protests and claims that the Vedas teach how to attain phenom- enal objects, such as rain, a son or how to achieve heaven, we answer 
matches either. The reference from Hari-vamsa Purana is also apocryphal, as the Bhavisya-parva is much shorter in the original version. Nevertheless, this is the source that Baladeva Vidyabhuṣaṇa ascribes to the verse. There is a similar verse in Skanda Purāṇa, Kasi-khanda 4.93.15, which has the same first half; the second half reads, ādi-madhyāvasaneṣu harir eko'tra naparah. upakramopasaṁhārāv abhyaso'pūrvată phalam arthavādopapatti ca lingam tätparya-nirnaye

Gas follows: These procedures are included in the Vedas for the pur- campose of inspiring faith in ignorant people and encouraging them to 
acquire Vedic knowledge. When they see that following the Vedas produces the desired results, it strengthens their faith and inspires them to study further. Upon the awakening of discernment, they are able to discriminate between the eternal and the temporary, and awakening a taste in transcendence, their taste in phenomenal exis- tence is expired. In this way they will ultimately understand Bhaga- Jive van, the Absolute Reality15 
Thus, Śrī Kṛṣṇa says, "I alone am to be known from all the Vedas" (vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyaḥ, GITA 15.15). The emphatic particle eva indicates that Krsna alone is the highest truth disclosed in the Vedas. The purpose of the Vedas is not to teach about karma or yajña, though it may appear so at a cursory look. 
In the following anuccheda it will be shown how words can describe Bhagavan even though He is free from the material

The meaning is as follows: The Śrutis appear to be functioning in the material gunas, such as sattva, because they are composed of sounds that appear to be like any material sound. But Brah- man is nirguna (free from the gunas), like sattva, and is therefore

Śrī Bhagavat Sandarbha 
“indeterminable” ( anirdeśya). This means that Brahman is inde- terminable, first, because it is devoid of all qualities [by which objects are determined], such as class, attributes, or actions, which are all products of the gunas, and, second, because no such [quality-less] entity is within the common range of people's expe- rience. Brahman is transcendental (para) to the gunas, like sattva, and to their products, and it is beyond both cause and effect (sat and asat), and thus it is without connection to any of these. T तथा च सति यथा डित्थवाचि कस्मिंश्चिदद्वितीये द्रव्ये तच्छब्दस्य मुख्या वृत्तिः प्रवर्तते । यथा च “सिंहो देवदत्तः” इत्यत्र गौण्या वृत्त्या शौर्यगुणयुक्ते देवदत्ते सिंहशब्दः प्रवर्तते । यथा च “गङ्गायां घोषः” इत्यत्रलक्षणया वृत्त्या गङ्गाशब्दस्तस्मिन्नित्यसम्बन्धे तटे प्रवर्तते तथा तत्तदभावास्पदे ब्रह्मणि तया तया वृत्त्या श्रुतयः कथं प्रवर्तेरन् ? 
This being the case, just as the primary meaning (mukhyā-vṛtti) of the word dittha is "a peerless object;" and just as in the state- ment, "Devadatta is a lion," the word "lion," by its secondary meaning (gauņi-vṛtti) refers to Devadatta, who is endowed with the attribute of courage; and just as the word ganga in the phrase, "the hamlet on the River Ganges," refers by its indicative meaning (laksanā-vrtti) to its bank, which has an inviolable relation with the river; in the same way, since the word brahma is devoid of all such vṛttis, how can the Śrutis possibly refer to it by any of them?

According to the principle that "Brahman is known only through the scriptures” (śāstra-yonitvāt, vs 1.1.3), it must be said that the Śrutis explain Brahman and no other. Additionally, since they are self-authoritative, it must also specifically be said that their principal meaning is Brahman. Thus, the question being raised, is, "Kindly instruct me how the Śrutis explain Brahman directly, by their primary meaning. I specifically want to know this."m अन्यथा पदार्थत्वायोगादपदार्थस्य च वाक्यार्थत्वायोगान् न श्रुतिगोचरत्वं ब्रह्मणः स्या- दिति स्थिते कुतस्तरां तदुपरिचरस्फूर्तेर्भगवतस्तद्गोचरत्वम् ? तत् कथमेव “स्वभक्तयोः”

Otherwise, if Brahman is not even an object intended by a word, i.e., apadartha, then the Śrutis cannot describe Brahman, since an apadartha is without connection to any verbal meaning. If this is the case, how then could the Śrutis describe Bhagavan, the realization of whom is higher even than Brahman? And then, why was it said [at the end of the previous chapter (SB 10.86.59)] that the Lord instructed His two devotees in surrender to Bha- gavān, which is the path of the self-authoritative Vedas? This is the question. To establish the self-validity of the Vedas, at least their primary statements must directly describe Brahman, because other statements, such as those that carry only indica- tive meaning (lakṣaṇā), depend on some other authority. The essence of the question is that if even the indicative meaning is not possible in Brahman, then how can the direct meaning apply?

bet doors gainsom og brow IN SECTIONS 95 AND 96, it was shown that Srimad Bhagavatam, which is the essence of all Vedic literature, aims only at Bhagavan. Then in Anuccheda 97, it was shown that Bhagavan is the common subject of all scriptures, whether directly or indirectly ascertained. 
Previously, however, it was established that Bhagavan is sup- remely transcendental to phenomenality of any kind. Hearing all this, one may raise an objection: Sound is material, being produced by material instruments, so how can scriptures, which are noth- ing but an embodiment of sound, describe the transcendental Lord? In response to this, Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmi provides a lengthy analysis, explaining how sound can approach Bhagavan, who is beyond the gunas of material nature. In order to do so, he cites the question Parīkṣit Mahārāja asks at the beginning of chapter 87 of the Tenth Canto, and Sukadeva Gosvāmi's response.

negoŚrī Bhagavat Sandarbha 84 
All literature, including the Veda, is composed of words. Every Sanskrit word (pada) has a meaning (artha), and there is a rela- tion between the two. A word has a potency by which it con- veys its meaning, which is called vṛtti. Primarily the vṛttis of all words can be divided into three groups, called abhidha (primary or direct), lakṣaṇā (secondary or indicative), and vyañjanā (suggestive). Abhidha is sometimes also called mukhyā. The meanings conveyed through these three vṛttis are designated with reference to their corresponding vṛtti. For example, the meaning derived through abhidha-vṛtti is called abhidhartha or mukhyārtha? 
vdw 
The primary, or abhidha, meaning is that which springs to mind as soon as the word is heard. This is the popular meaning of the word. This meaning is generally found in the dictionary and some- times from learned people. For example, as soon as we hear the word "cow," we picture an animal with four legs, a tail, two ears and so on, in our minds. This, then, is the primary meaning of the word "cow," which is conveyed by the abhidha-vṛtti. 
The abhidha-vṛtti is of three types: 
(11. Yaugiki. When a word's meaning is derived from the combined potency of its constituent roots and suffixes, the meaning is called yaugiki-abhidha, and the potency is called yaugikī-abhidhā- vṛtti. For example, the word pacaka, meaning "a cook," is derived from the verbal root √pac (to cook) combined with the nvul suffix HOVE(PANINI 3.1.133, naka according to HNV 5.194), giving it the sense w nom of a noun agent. One who knows the rules of Sanskrit grammar ho would easily understand the meaning, just as an English speaker would recognize the various possible derivations of the verb "to cocook," such as cook, cooker, cooking, etc. 
don 
2. Rūdhi. When the sense of a word is completely independent of the inherent meaning derived from its constituent roots and suf- fixes, such a vṛtti is called rūḍhi-vṛtti. For example, the word So mandapa means a pavillion or a temporary hall, but the meaning according to its constituent words should be, "one who drinks sabrice water" (mandam pibati), or, "one who guards ornaments" nou (mandam bhūṣāṁ pāti). Here, the meaning is not dependent on 
2 The discussion of three kinds of sabda-vṛtti supplements was given earlier in 
Section 3. 
94098 The Vedic Sound Reveals Bhagavan 
Lis the combined meaning of the word's individual constituents, but 
efon another sense that has been attributed by custom. 2783. Yoga-ruḍhi. This is a mixture of the two previous vṛttis. Although in this case the meaning of a word is rooted in the power of its con- Taupe stituents, it has become associated with only one specific instance of that meaning. For example, according to its constituent parts, the word pankaja means, "that which is born out of mud" (parkāj 
br jayate). Although there are many things that grow or arise in muddy water, the word pankaja specifically refers only to the Jenglotus.

LAKSANA-VṚTTI. When the primary meaning, or abhidha-vṛtti, fails to render the proper meaning of a word in a particular context, it is abandoned, and a secondary meaning is sought that is related to the primary meaning in some way. As is stated in Nyaya-siddhanta- muktavali, "When the speaker's intent is not understood through the primary meaning of the words, then the indicative meaning, lakṣaṇā, is taken." This will be related to the primary meaning. For example: In the statement, "The Jiva Institute is situated on Jiva Road," cer- tainly the intent of the speaker is not that the Institute is actually on the road, because such a thing is not possible. Therefore, rejecting the primary meaning of "on the road," one is expected to understand "beside the road." 
Lakṣaṇa-vṛtti has three divisions, called ajahat-svärthā, jahat- svärtha and jahad-ajahat-svartha. Ajahat-svärtha means without giving up the original meaning of the word, as in the statement kuntāḥ praviśanti, "the spears are entering." Here kuntāḥ, or spears, refers to the people carrying spears, kunta-dhārī. In this instance, the meaning of the word kunta has not been dropped (ajahat) but extended to refer to those carrying them. 
In jahat-svärtha, the original meaning of the word is dropped, as in gangāyāṁ ghoṣaḥ, where the word gangā drops its original mean- ing as the river Ganges and is translated as the bank of the river Ganges. Ty lands add atgsoon 
3 lakṣaṇā śakya-sambandhas tatparya'nupapattitaḥ 
Kārikā 82 
941 
vega Śri Bhagavat Sandarbharu 
In jahad-ajahat-svartha, part of the meaning is dropped and another part preserved. The phrase tat tvam asi, "You are That," is a famous example of jahad-ajahat in Advaitavada. Here tat refers to Brahman and tvam to an individual being. The two have been equated in the above statement. Yet they cannot be absolutely equal if the literal meaning of the pronouns tat and tvam is taken. The individual being is a conscious entity limited by a material body, whereas Brahman is unlimited consciousness. If the two pronouns that refer respectively to Brahman and the living being are dropped, then what remains is consciousness, and that is what is being equated in this sentence. 
VYANJANA-VṚTTI. When the abhidha-vṛtti and lakṣaṇā-vṛtti have made their respective contributions and yet more meaning is needed to complete the sense, then one looks to the vyañjana-vṛtti. For exam- ple, in the statement about the Jiva Institute, after one has under- stood its location, further suggested meanings may arise, such as that it is approachable by vehicle. Such a suggested meaning has no relation to the primary meaning of the words themselves. Vyañjana- vṛtti has thousands of divisions, and it is beyond the scope of this discussion to enter into them. Suffice to say that the two main ones are śabdi, or vyañjană based on the word, and arthi, or that based on the meaning. 
"bros 917 obiesd 
Of all the vṛttis, vyañjana is also the most difficult to comprehend. It is used by most learned Sanskrit scholars in their writings. Śrīmad Bhāgavatam, especially the Tenth Canto, is a masterpiece based on vyañjana-vṛtti. 
H 
Some scholars occasionally count gauņi-vṛtti as a fourth category, as Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī has also done. It is metaphorical in nature, such as simho māṇavakah (the lion boy). The boy is not a lion, but has some of a lion's characteristics, such as courage. In this analysis, which is a more standard one, gauņi simply forms a part of the lakṣaṇā-vṛtti. 75vIn Sahitya-darpana, a standard work on poetics, the author accepts the above three vṛttis. There are three types of meanings, called vācya (abhidha), lakṣya and vyangya. The author says: 
*artho vācyaś ca lakṣyaś ca vyangyaś ceti tridha mataḥ

goi The vācya meaning of a word is known from abhidha; lakṣya, through lakṣaṇā; and vyangya, through vyañjana. These are the three poten- süncies of a word. (SD 2.3)5

The purpose of the above analysis is to provide a background for the following discussion: When deriving the meaning of a word based on abhidha-vṛtti or mukhya-vṛtti, one does not have to resort to any other help, such as logic. The meaning comes directly and naturally from the word. Therefore, the meaning conveyed by the abhidha-vṛtti is self-authoritative. When, however, one takes the meaning based on the lakṣaṇa-vṛtti or vyañjana-vṛtti, one has to look to something other than the primary meaning of the word. Though such a meaning is not self-authoritative, it does not imply that such interpretations or explanations are without value. Without recourse to them, it would be impossible to understand the intent of the Vedic literature or to reconcile the contradictions found therein. 
Lakṣaṇā-vṛtti is used only when the primary meaning fails to con- vey a proper sense. When, however, a word directly conveys its sense adequately, it is considered a deviation from the author's or speaker's intent to put forth a secondary meaning instead.

Another crucial point to be borne in mind is that without having a primary meaning, there is no possibility that a word could have a secondary or implied meaning either (i.e., lakṣaṇa-vṛtti or vyañjanā- vrtti). 
The question posed by King Parīkṣit at the beginning of chap- ter 87 of the Tenth Canto is based on the popular understanding that Brahman is anirdeśya, or ineffable. The reason for this is that ultimately all types of meaning can fit into the classifications of dravya, jāti, guna and kriya - object or substance, family or class, quality or attribute, and activity. A word is material and so are its various meanings. Brahman, however, does not fit into any of these categories, being beyond the gunas of nature. Since these four categories are products of the three gunas of nature, how can the Vedas describe the indescribable Brahman? And if they can- not describe Brahman, how can they approach Bhagavan, who is beyond Brahman? But if Brahman cannot be described in words, then it becomes an apadartha, a meaningless combination of words like "rabbit horns."

At the end of the previous chapter, Śrī Śukadeva said that Śrī Kṛṣṇa instructed His two devotees, Bahulāśva and Śrutadeva, in knowledge of the Absolute (SB 10.86.59). Hearing this, Parikṣit Mahārāja raised this question. He acknowledges that Brahman as well as Bhagavan are the subject matter of the Vedas, but does not know how this can be possible.

He did so in order that the living beings may have facility to apprehend sense objects and for the other objec- tives mentioned. Since Sukadeva does not say that the living beings [themselves] created all these out of their own ignorance (avidya), the philosophy called Vivartavāda' is denied.

Whatever can be measured or perceived [by the senses] is called mätrā, meaning the sense objects. The apprehension of these is one of the purposes for which the intellect and so on have been created by the Lord. Bhava signifies action that leads to, or pro- ceeds from birth, so bhavartha means for the purpose of engag- ing in action related to birth. Atmane (for the self) means for the jiva who travels to other realms, i.e., so that the individual selves can experience the full range of material realms and phenomena. Akalpanaya means in order to free them from filtering experience through the screen of prior assumptions (kalpana), or in other words, for liberation. The meaning of the four words in sequence, i.e., mäträrtha, bhavartha, ātmane and akalpanaya, corresponds to [the four goals of human life, or puruṣārthas, namely] material

In this verse, mokṣa refers to two types of liberation. In one type, the self exists solely as pure consciousness, whereas the second is that which gives rise to sadhya-bhakti, or devotion in love. These two types of liberation have been successively described in the texts of the Fifth Canto, beginning with, "By offering the fruits of their actions performed according to their varna, they attain liberation" (SB 5.19.19), and ending in, "After cutting asunder the knot of ignorance, which gives rise to various births, he attains liberation as the yoga of pure devotional service" (SB 5.19.20). In both cases, ignorance, in the form of mentally constructing an assumed or apparent reality (kalpanā), is dispelled.

This is so because the conscious potency bestows awareness of the Real in the form of transcendental devo- tion, and because it is the cause of ending the bondage that results from forgetfulness of one's original nature.

In this way, as long as the living beings exist in a state of non- awareness of Bhagavan, their intelligence, senses, mind and so on are exclusively under the material gunas. As such, the intel- ligence and so on function as the primary instruments of igno- rance, because they are illumined only by the energy of igno- rance, which is of the nature of apparent or assumed reality. In this state, therefore, they cannot directly apprehend anything that is beyond the gunas [which is to say, they cannot function directly in respect to that which is nirguna]. This is undoubtedly 
true.

Thus, I have replied to the question you asked of me, O King, con- cerning how the mind too can have access to the Absolute Truth, which is ineffable and free from the gunas. (SB 10.87.49)10

nod 
Here there is specific mention of "the mind," which was included in the earlier verse along with the intellect and other senses. The internal potency, cit-sakti, becomes self-manifest in the intelli- gence, mind and so on, pervading them from within, where it reveals the transcendental supremely blissful nature, qualities and so on, of the Lord. So too, the cit-sakti becomes self-manifest in words, which renders them capable of describing the same truths. This is the understanding. Therefore, it will be concluded that the Śruti defines the transcendental nature, qualities and so forth of the Supreme Lord.

It is thus established that even human speech [and not only the non-human (apauruşeya) words of the Vedas] can describe the activities of Bhagavan, as stated by Śri Narada Muni:

This being the case, how much more true must it be that the trans-human (apauruşeya) words of the Vedas are able to describe Bhagavan, when He is their sole subject and they have mani- fested directly from His breath? Therefore, the Śrutis certainly describe the Absolute Truth directly. This will be stated fur- ther on [in the prayers of the personified Upanisads]: "The Veda is able to describe You when You sport with Your Maya during creation, and when You exist in Your own transcendental Self" (SB 10.87.14).12

Indeed, the Śruti declares, "Om is the name nearest to Brahman." Nearest means without the obstruction of lakṣaṇā, or indica- tive meaning and so on. So the sole intent of King Parīkṣit is, "Please explain how the Śrutis directly define the Lord." The defect thought to be incurred from the view that Brahman is definable in words will be removed later on in SB 10.87.41.14 SETE

Now, some Śrutis appear to be concerned with the state of non- awareness of the Real (bahirmukha) because they are concerned with the three material goals, but in fact these too culminate only in awareness of the Real (antarmukha). For example, the Śrutis, which are the manifestation of the Lord's breath, have as their sole purpose the bestowing of mercy on the multitude of living beings who perpetually exist in a state of non-awareness of the supreme goal of life. In the beginning, so that people who have no knowledge of imperceptible phenomena and who conti- nously hanker after the visible objects of this world will develop faith in the Śrutis, they ordain sacrifices, like the putrești [rit- uals for obtaining a son], by which such material goals can be accomplished. 
ततश्च तेन जातविश्वासानैहिकस्यात्यन्तमस्थिरत्वं प्रदर्श्य दिव्यानन्दचमत्कारविचित्रस्य पारलौकिकस्वर्गादिलक्षणतत्तत्कामस्य जनकेऽग्निष्टोमादौ प्रवर्तयन्ति । ततस्तेषां निरन्त- रतदभ्यासाद् धर्म एव रुचिं जनयन्ति । 
Thereafter, when faith is generated in the Śrutis through such procedures, the Śrutis demonstrate the absolutely flickering nature of the objects of this world to these people and engage them in sacrifices like the agniṣṭoma, which induce in them the desire to attain the celestial, blissful and wondrous plea- sures of heaven, available after this life. By thus engaging them 
14 This verse is the last one in the Veda-stuti, given in Section 98.8.

Once these people have acquired a liking for dharma, they become purified in heart and are engaged in deliberating over the mean- ing of the Śrutis. They come to recognize that this cosmos is ephemeral and experience dejection due to the fear of birth and death. At this point the Śrutis create in such persons the desire for the bliss of liberation, which is nothing other than the appearance of the Absolute. As Śrī Sūta Gosvāmī says:

One should not think that wealth is the purpose of virtuous action (dharma), which is actually meant to bring about free- dom from material existence (apavargasya), nor that the reward of wealth, which is meant to be used for virtuous acts, lies only in the enjoyment of desire. The fulfillment of desire is not intended ei merely for sensual gratification, but rather, should extend no further than the sustenance of life. And the point of remain- ing alive is to enquire into Reality, and not for anything else attainable through the performance of ritual acts. (SB 1.2.9-10 ) 15

Thereafter, just as the intelligence and so on become functional in relation to transcendental Reality to the extent of their attune- ment to that Reality through the manifestation of the conscious potency (cit-śakti), similarly, the statements of the Śruti are per- fectly able to transcend the subject matters embedded in the three guņas through the progressive manifestation of the con- scious potency, and have as their exclusive subject that which is beyond the material gunas. The Śruti statements can thus prop- erly describe the nirguna Absolute, as they are endowed with the capacity to function in freedom from the material gunas. This is stated in the Twelfth Canto with reference to pranava: 
ततोऽभूत् त्रिवृदोङ्कारो योऽव्यक्तप्रभवः स्वराट् । यत्तल्लिङ्गं भगवतो ब्रह्मणः परमात्मनः ॥ ४७० ॥ इति । 
From that sound arose onkara, consisting of three parts [a-u- m], whose origin is unmanifest and which appears automatically within the purified heart. It is the representation of the Absolute Truth in its three aspects of Bhagavan, Paramātmā and Brahman. (SB 12.6.39) 
तत्र तत्तत्त्वं द्विधा स्फुरति भगवद्रूपेण ब्रह्मरूपेण चेति । चिच्छक्तिरपि द्विधा तदीयस्वयम्प्र- काशादिमयभक्तिरूपेण तन्मयज्ञानरूपेण च । ततो भक्तिमयश्रुतयो भगवति चरन्ति ज्ञान- मयश्रुतयो ब्रह्मणीति सामान्यतः सिद्धान्तितम् ।

This Absolute Reality manifests to eligible people in two ways- as Bhagavan and as Brahman. Accordingly, the cit-sakti is also of two types: (1) in the form of the potency of devo- tion, which embodies attributes such as self-luminosity or self- manifestation, and (2) in the form of awareness of identity with that Truth (Brahman). The general principle is that the Śrutis that are the embodiment of bhakti treat of Bhagavan, while those that are the embodiment of jñāna treat of Brahman. 
Commentary 
Śukadeva begins answering the question of Mahārāja Parīkṣit in SB 10.87.2. The Lord created the senses, intelligence, mind and life 
952 
98 The Vedic Sound Reveals Bhagavan 
force for the conditioned living beings, so that they could achieve the four goals called dharma, artha, kama and mokṣa. Everything desirable by human beings can fit into one of these four categories. 
The living beings are conscious parts of the conscious Whole, Śrī Kṛṣṇa. They are unable to create their own mind, intelligence, senses and so on, because they are not the controllers of material nature. This undermines the philosophy of the Sankarites, called Vivartavāda. 
Vivartavāda is one name for the theory of illusion (Māyāvāda). According to this theory, the material creation has no factual exis- tence but is only an illusory appearance, just as in semi-darkness one may see a snake where there is only a rope. The rope has phe- nomenal existence, but may look like a snake in poor light. But as soon as proper lighting is thrown on it, the illusion of a snake disappears and one sees the rope as it is. 
The snake is the vivarta of the rope, or in other words, an illu- sory appearance produced from ignorance. It is not real because one has not seen it in the proper light. Yet, it is not unreal, like a rabbit horn, because one sees an existing object (i.e., the rope), and the fear too is genuinely felt. Nevertheless, it is mithya (untrue) or vivarta. Similarly, out of ignorance one mistakes Brahman to be the world. However, as soon as one acquires proper knowledge from Śruti statements, such as aham brahmāsmi, one realizes everything to be Brahman. This is Vivartavāda. 
Just as one perceives the rope to be a snake due to one's own ignorance, similarly, one perceives the world in place of Brahman because of one's own avidya. Hence, in the light of Vivartavāda, Brah- man should not be regarded as the creator of avidya, and by exten- sion, nor of the material world. But the SB 10.87.2 states that the Lord, and not the living being, created the senses as well as the sense objects. It is a manifestation of His energy. This refutes the concept of Vivartavāda. 
Is This is further confirmed by vs 1.4.26, atma-kṛteḥ pariņāmāt, Brahman is both the material as well as the efficient cause of the cosmos because He is the agent and because it is His energy that is modified into the cosmos. 
953 
VŚri Bhagavat Sandarbha 
In the Bhāgavatam verse, the word mātrā means sense objects and is related to the pursuit of prosperity, artha. Bhava means birth as well as all actions proceeding from and leading to birth, and is related to dharma, or the moral responsibility that embodied life entails. The word atmane means in the self, or more specifically in this case, the range of experiences available to the self. It refers to kāma, or enjoyment in the earthly and heavenly spheres. 
Kalpana means the mental construction of assumed or appar- ent realities. Basically this refers to the filtering or interpreting of reality in accordance with self-identity and belief. Until conscious- ness is fully attuned to the Real, every act of perception involves varying degrees of kalpana, or filtering experience through the indi- vidual belief system, so that what is understood is not Reality in itself, but the apparent or consensual reality that the "I" is identi- fied with. Akalpana thus means freedom from all mental, interpre- tations, assumptions, falsehoods or illusions, to see Reality as it is. Thus, akalpana refers to mokṣa.

Naturally one may doubt how this verse answers Parīkṣit Mahā- raja's question, as there appears to be no correlation between the two. But this is not the case. This type of answer is an example of parokṣa-vāda, or indirect speech, referred to earlier.16 mia 
Śrīla Viśvanatha Cakravarti comments that the question was asked in abhidha-vṛtti (direct meaning) and Śrī Suka is replying in vyañjana-vṛtti (implied meaning). He says that if the Lord had not created senses for the living beings, then forms, sound and so on, would be indescribable, but by His mercy they can describe phe- nomenal objects. Similarly, by His mercy the Vedas can describe Brahman, which appears to be indescribable. When one is in the conditioned state, one's senses, mind, intelligence and vital force function only in regard to the material energy, under the influence of the gunas, and hence, they can apprehend only material objects. But when one shifts the context of awareness from that of being a separated-self in an alienated world to that of being an eternal

conscious part of an integrated Whole, then devotion to Bhagavan is embraced as an inherent expression of that real eternal relation. From this attunement or receptivity to Bhagavan through devotion, the conscious potency of Bhagavan self-manifests, pervading the mind, senses and so on. Then, with the same set of transmuted instruments, one can apprehend the transcendental Reality. Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmi confirms this in the following way: 
dquor 
Śrī Kṛṣṇa's name, form, qualities and pastimes cannot be uttered or hgrasped at by way of the material senses. Only when the mind and 
senses are transmuted through unalloyed devotion, do the name, form and so on, manifest of their own volition, on the tongue or other senses. (BRS 1.2.234) 17 
Moksa is of two types: realizing the self as pure consciousness or realizing the self as a purely conscious servant of the Lord. Both are possible only by the grace of the Lord's internal potency. Śrī Matsya said to King Satyavrata: 
You will know My glory, which is celebrated as Parabrahman, for it will be thoroughly revealed to you within your heart, both as a result of your own profound inquiry and by My mercy. (SB 8.24.38) 18 
Here the Lord clearly says that Parabrahman becomes manifest through inquiry owing to the Lord's mercy, anugṛhitam me. By Śri Kṛṣṇa's mercy, Arjuna was able to see even Brahman: isigmos bro

Material objects are described by material sound, functioning under the gunas, and the transcendental Lord is described by the transcendental sound of the Vedas, functioning under the con- scious potency. This is the significance of the word akalpanaya in the verse under discussion. Devotees whose consciousness is per- fectly attuned to Bhagavan have their body, mind and senses trans- muted through the infusion of the conscious potency. Thus, they can directly perceive the Lord and describe Him through transcendental sound. When Reality is directly perceived, there is no more filter- ing of Reality through the screen of belief or mental construction (kalpana). 
ab 
to be bus 
Sadhaka-bhaktas, or devotees in the stage of practice, are unable to directly perceive Bhagavan, but they are able to fix their mind and intelligence on Him to varying degrees, in accordance with the descriptions portrayed in the scriptures. Śrī Kṛṣṇa says: 
The more consciousness is purified by hearing and reciting My holy pastimes, the more it can perceive the subtle Reality, just as the eyes can see minute objects when treated with therapeutic ointment. (SB 11.14.26) 
Bhagavan gradually infuses the devotee's senses with the inter- nal potency. Although their meditation may not be pure, He accepts it out of His causeless mercy. He makes possible the perfection and completion of their devotion, and ultimately brings them to His abode. 
In the same way, the Śrutis are able to describe the transcen- dental Lord by His mercy. Even Brahman cannot be approached by non-devotees, including impersonalists, whose senses continue to function under the potency of mayā. 
Jiva Gosvāmi says that even the words of a human being can approach Bhagavan - if he is a devotee - what to speak of the Vedas, which are apauruşeya, or beyond human origin. This is the import of Narada's statement to Vyasa: 
Manifestations of speech related to the Lord reverse people's procliv- ity for sin. Since each verse of such composition contains names

imprinted with the glories of the infinite Lord, sages love to hear, ga sing and recite them, even if they may contain faulty construction. (SB 1.5.11)20 
The Radical Nondualists contend that the Vedas describe Brah- man only by lakṣaṇā-vṛtti. Jiva Gosvāmī proves, however, that not only the Vedas, but even the words of pure devotees, describe the Lord by abhidha or mukhya-vṛtti, as well as by the lakṣaṇa-vṛtti and vyañjana-vṛtti. 
Sūta Gosvāmi explains that Om is the direct utterance for the Lord, sākṣād-vācakaḥ paramätmanaḥ (SB 12.6.41). By direct, he means that this utterance lacks obstructions or intervals, as would be the case with the lakṣaṇā-vṛtti and vyañjana-vṛtti. In fact, the purpose of those scriptural statements that speak of dharma, artha and kāma is to lead one to Bhagavan. Such statements attract the attention of materialistic people to the Vedas, and help them become qualified to hear about transcendental subjects. 
Faith is the foundation of the devotional path. One begins this path with faith, and one's advancement is measured by the degree of one's faith. The inclusion of fruitive activities in the Vedas serves like the sugar-coating on a bitter pill. A child does not like to take bitter medicine, so it is coated with sugar. The purpose is not to feed the child sugar, but to make the medicine acceptable. Avirhotra Yogendra explained this to King Nimi: 
The Veda speaks indirectly. Its real import is to lead one to transcend karma and its fruits, but it prescribes karma for the ignorant, just as a child is tempted with sweets 
in order to induce him take a bitter medicine. (SB 11.3.44) diw awol

One is infused with the internal potency of Bhagavan in pro- portion to one's faith and dedication of being, and one's speech can also approach Bhagavan to the same extent. By the same token, one is proportionally able to penetrate the words of the Vedas that

apparently deal with the three gunas of nature and perceive their transcendental nature. Śrī Kṛṣṇa advised Arjuna to search out the real subject in the Vedas: 
de The Vedas deal mainly with the subject of the three gunas of mate- forial nature. O Arjuna, become transcendental to these three gunas. 
(GĪTĀ 2.45)22 
Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmi says that the Absolute is realized either as Bha- gavan or as Brahman. Thus, there are two types of Śrutis - those that describe Bhagavan and those that describe Brahman. They are a manifestation of the bhakti and jñāna potencies, respectively. Paramātmā is counted as an expansion of Bhagavan and not sepa- rately, since His manifestation is relevant only in regard to the cycle of cosmic manifestation.

At the time of total dissolution, Bhagavan drinks in, i.e., retracts, His own creation, this cosmos, and lies down with His energies. That is to say, He withdraws prakṛti, puruşa and their various por- tions into Himself and closes His eyes toward them so as not to arouse their manifestation. At the end of that period, namely, when the duration of the dissolution is drawing to an end, the Śrutis awaken Him by His characteristics, namely, by making statements that proclaim Him [as the Supreme Lord]. In other words, they pleased the Lord by means of panegyrics meant to wake Him in the morning.

At the end of the creation cycle, the material elements merge back into primordial nature, prakṛti. At that time, the conditioned living beings along with prakṛti are enfolded within the body of Param- ātmā, who merges into Nārāyaṇa. Paramātmā has no function during the dissolution period. This is refered to as His sleep.

Commentary 
fir 
Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī cites the prayers offered to the Lord by the person- ified Śrutis at the beginning of creation to show how they directly describe the Lord. They wake Him up from His cosmic sleep and implore Him to create, just as Indian kings were praised by bards in the morning. The very fact that the Śrutis pray to the Lord proves that they directly glorify Him. Moreover, they are transcendental because these prayers took place prior to the material creation.

In their first prayer, the Śrutis show that the Absolute Reality in its entirety, in the form of Bhagavan, is the Truth that they themselves aim to disclose in their discourse. This Reality is expe- rienced through the process of bhakti-yoga, which bestows such complete realization, and which is served by a composite of other attributes, such as jñāna. They begin by embracing the Brahman aspect as having that same nature: 150 Infowogs and vitost

The Vedas are saying, "O unconquerable Lord (Ajita)! Conquer, conquer (jaya jaya)! That is, please reveal Your excellence!" The repetition of the word jaya is intended to show Him honor.

Here the invocation ajita signifies the following: According to the principle that states, "The recitation of Śrī Viṣṇu's name is such that His attention is drawn to the reciter" (SB 6.2.10),26 the Holy Name brings the attention of the Supreme Lord directly towards the one who recites it. This evidence shows that Bhagavan's name, like His body, is part of His essential nature. If it were foreign in nature to Him, it could not draw His attention.

matter, the statements of the Vedas and the experience of real- ized beings have already been given as evidence.?" So, the same Absolute Reality that manifests to the eyes in a visible transcen- dental form also manifests on the tongue and ears in the form of His Name. 
तस्मान् नामनामिनोः स्वरूपाभेदेन तत्साक्षात्कारे तत्साक्षात्कार एवेत्यतः किं वक्तव्यम् । अन्यत्रान्यवद् भगवति श्रुतयोऽपि जात्यादिकृतसञ्ज्ञासञ्ज्ञिसङ्केतादिरीत्या रूढ्यादिवृ- त्तिभिश्चरन्तीति । यासां श्रुत्यभिधानां वल्लीनां साक्षात् तथाभूतानि नामान्येव फलानीति । 
Now that it has been established that the essential nature of the Name is nondifferent from its owner, Bhagavan, [it can be said that] direct realization of the Name is certainly realization of Bhagavan. So it goes without saying that the Śruti is able to describe the Lord just as it describes other objects elsewhere, by vṛttis such as rūḍhi (popular understanding), which indicate an object by its name, which is derived from its characteristics, such as class and so on. Indeed, such names of the Lord are directly the fruit of the vines called the Śrutis.

The statement, "reveal Your excellence," indicates that the Śrutis are able to describe the Lord directly by connecting to His super- excellent attributes through the primary meaning of words (mukhya-vṛtti). Vedic statements that confirm this are, "No one can glorify You fully" (RV 7.99.1),28 "No one is equal or superior to Him" (su 6.8).29 Furthermore, in revealing their own devotion by uttering the words jaya jaya, the Śrutis make it understood that bhakti is the cause of the Lord's manifestation.

A doubt may be raised: "But māyā is an energy that has the func- tions of both knowledge (vidya) and ignorance (avidya). If it is dispelled, then would not vidya also be abandoned?" The Śrutis respond, "By whom even qualities are taken as defects" (dosa- grbhita-guṇām). This compound refers to maya, by whom even the quality characterized as vidya, which is the cause of self- remembrance, is taken only as a defect, characterized as avidyā, the cause of the living beings' forgetfulness of their real nature. The invocation is to dispel that mayā [who makes even knowledge seem like ignorance]. Engrossing the living beings in herself, she gives rise to the defect called avidya. So, it is only in some places, only at some times, that she somehow releases only some living beings. Thus, her positive quality, called vidya, by which she releases the living being, is also a defect. Therefore, uproot her completely and please bestow devotion for Your lotus feet on the living beings. This is the purport.sta

In this way, after directly stating that the Lord is transcendental to māyā, since He is able to dispel her, the Śrutis, while reveal- ing His eternal, conscious and blissful nature, describe Him by tätparya-vṛtti, or intended meaning, primarily through the process of negation (atan-nirasana).

Alternatively, the objection is this: "But by destroying māyā, the jiva, who is an upadhi of māyā, will become devoid of energy." Here again, the Śrutis reply, "O You who awaken all the powers of the moving and unmoving embodied beings!" The meaning is the same as above. 
ततः स्वरूपशक्त्यैव प्रत्युत तेषां सुखैकप्रदा पूर्णा शक्तिर्भविष्यतीति भावः । अत्रेत्थं तटस्थ- लक्षणेन श्रुतयश्चरन्तीत्युक्तम् । श्रुतयश्च “को ह्येवान्याद्” ( तै० २।७।१) इत्यादिकाः “प्राणस्य प्राणम्” (बृ० ४।४।१८) इत्यादिकाः “ तमेव भान्तम् ” ( कठ २।२।१५) इत्यादिकाः “देहान्ते देवस्तारकं ब्रह्म व्याचष्टे” । श्वे० ६ । २३ 
I ०६।२३- 
On the other hand, it is only by Bhagavan's svarupa-sakti that the energy of the living beings will be completed, becoming exclu- sively delightful. In this manner, the Śrutis describe the Lord by His extrinsic characteristics (taṭastha-lakṣaṇa). Some Vedic mantras confirming this are, "If Brahman, the personification of bliss, were not in the sky or in the heart, who else would infuse action and maintain the life force?" (TU 2.7.1),37 "He is the vitality of the vital force, the seeing power of the eye and the hearing capacity of the ear" (BAU 4.4.18), and, "All this shines forth by His brilliance" (KU 2.2.15), and so on. "At the end of his life, Lord Nrsimha speaks the taraka-brahma-mantra" (NTU 1.6),39 and:

The Śrutis reply, "On occasion, etc." (kvacit). On occasion means at particular times, namely, at the time of creation and so on, when You sport with māyā in Your form as the Purusa; it also means eternally, when You engage with "Your own Self," in whom innate opulences manifest through Your svarupa-sakti, and who are entirely eternal, conscious and blissful in nature. At these times we, the Śrutis, serve You both in our forms of sound and as deities. Therefore, we know all of that. This is the meaning. The words [te ... caratah] are in the genitive case, but are being used in the accusative sense.

Śruti dealing with the three gunas has three further classifica- tions. The first depicts Him in neutral terms, as the support [of creation]. For example, "He is that from which all these living beings are born" (TU 3.1.1), and so on. 
द्वितीयप्रकारश्च त्रिगुणमयतदीशितव्यादिवर्णनादिद्वारा तन्महिमादिदर्शकः । यथा “इन्द्रो यतोऽवसितस्य राजा” इत्यादिः । 
The second type makes evident His glories by describing that material nature, consisting of the three gunas, is under His con- trol. These are texts such as, "It is due to Him that Indra functions as king of the bonded beings" (RV 1.38.15),42 and so on.

The third type indicates Him as the Supreme Substantive, by negation of material nature consisting of the three gunas. This sort is also of two types - one which does so by denial (nisedha), and the other by identity of relationship (sämänyādhikaranya). Instances of the first of these are, "He is neither gross nor atomic in size, etc" (BAU 3.8.8), and, "[He is] Not this, not this" (neti neti, BAU 3.9.26). Examples of the second are texts like, "Indeed, all this is Brahman" (sarvam khalv idam brahma, CHU 3.14.1), and, "You are that" (tat tvam asi, CHU 6.8.7). brod dish asb

The latter quotation (You are that) establishes the oneness between Brahman (tat-padārtha) and the pure jiva (tvam-padā- rtha), because the jiva is conscious like Brahman and is the embod- iment of its energy. By this too the tat-padartha is defined as Brahman itself. The word tat has been used because knowledge of tvam-padartha is trivial without knowledge of tat-padartha (or Brahman).

Where the Śrutis denounce the material gunas, it is done to indicate Him so that His characteris- tics are clearly understood, in which case they define Bhagavan. When, however, the attributes are not explicit, the Śrutis define Brahman. In this way, the Śrutis dealing with the three gunas have been explained. Thus, it has been demonstrated how the Vedas describe the Lord even as He engages in pastimes related to the external potency, māyā.

To deal The Śrutis dealing with subjects free from the three gunas (nis- traigunya) are also of two types - those defining Brahman and those defining Bhagavan. An example of the first is the statement, “Brahman is ānanda” (TU 3.6.1 ), and an example of the second:

Thus, it has been proven that the Śrutis are able to describe Him. That the nistraigunya Śrutis do so directly is self-evident. The other Śrutis define the Lord through conformity with those statements. They speak of the various gunas only to dismiss māyā. Thereafter, rejecting maya categorically, they directly delineate the nature, attributes and so on of the Lord. In this way, by showing the conformity of the various Śrutis, this very conclusion [that the Śrutis are able to describe Him] has been instructed in this opening statement of the Śrutis' prayers, as well as in their concluding statement, "The Śrutis, whose final conclusion is in You alone, become successful by revealing You indirectly, through the method of negating everything that is not You" (SB 10.87.41).45

sunen toparni mwy ziH pt hotelog is a 294849 The Śrutis address the Lord by the name Ajita, the Invincible. This indicates that the sound of His Name has the power to reach Him and attract His attention. This is possible only if that Name is also transcendental, as nothing material can approach the Lord. Since there is no duality in the spiritual world, the Lord's Name is nondif- ferent from Him. Therefore, realization of His Name is the same as realizing Him. His Name carries power even if chanted out of fear or anger. This is evident from the history of Ajamila. The Holy Name is the mature fruit of the Vedas - sakala-nigama-valli sat-phalam cit- svarupam (from Skanda Purana). 
Thus, the Śrutis describe the Lord by the mukhya-vṛtti as well as by the other vṛttis. In commenting on SB 10.87.14, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi cites numerous Śruti mantras that describe the Lord in different types of vṛttis, such as mukhyā, tātparya, rudhi and lakṣaṇā. uno 35 Śrī Jiva next explains how the various sections of the Vedas define the Lord. The Vedas can be divided into two parts. Traigunya, or that dealing with the three gunas of nature; and nistraigunya, the portion dealing with the transcendental Reality, beyond the three gunas. The traigunya part includes the Karma-kända and Upāsanā- kāṇḍa sections, describing various types of sacrifices and prayers to the gods. The nistraigunya part has two divisions, that concerning Brahman (brahma-paraka) and that concerning Bhagavan (bhagavat- paraka). ora ait 1oqque of atmodate the 02l5 916 
All these various divisions of the Vedas define the Lord directly or indirectly. This is the significance of the phrase carato'nucaret nigamaḥ (SB 10.87.14), which will be further discussed below. The nistraigunya part of the Vedas directly describe Bhagavan.

The Śrutis reply, avikṛtāt, "From the untransformed," meaning that by His inconceivable potency, He remains devoid of any transformation, in accordance with the principle, "The Vedas state that the Lord is free from defects and can be understood only by revealed sound" (vs 2.1.27).5130 S

Although the "Immensity" is understood to be inclusive of poten- cies even in this verse, still only Brahman is established here, as the Bhagavan aspect has not been openly disclosed. This is because if potencies were totally rejected, it would not be pos- sible to establish even Brahman, and moreover Brahman would be reduced to insignificance. So, in this verse, only Brahman

Śrī Jiva's original insight is being provided in this part of the explanation.

But this establishment of Brahman also culminates in Bhagavan.

They do so because both Brahman and Bhagavan are one entity, and the apparent distinction is due only to the perception of the Lord's opulences either as manifest or unmanifest.

OVER Śrī Bhagavat Sandarbha 
Both the jñāna-yoga that is focused on Me and the yoga character- surized by unalloyed devotion free from the gunas have one purpose alone, which is indicated by the word bhagavan. (SB 3.32.32)53 
अत्र श्रुतयश्च मध्वभाष्यप्रमाणिताः “हन्तैतमेव पुरुषं सर्वाणि नामान्यभिवदन्ति । यथा नद्यः स्यन्दमानाः समुद्रायणाः समुद्रमभिविशन्ति एवमेवैतानि नामानि सर्वाणि पुरुषमभिविश- न्ति” इति । 
In this regard there are Śrutis cited by Śrī Madhvācārya in His Vedanta-bhāṣya: "Oh, what a wonder! All names ultimately address none other than this Lord. Just as all flowing rivers head- ing towards the ocean assuredly enter the ocean, similarly all these names enter into or describe only the Lord."54 
Commentary 
medi 
vino sub 
The Śrutis continue to explain in the second verse (SB 10.87.15) how their words can function directly in regard to the Lord, even though He is transcendental. Here it is stated that the ultimate purpose, even of the mantras that describe Brahman, culminates in Bhagavan. The inspiration for this verse comes from two passages in Chan- dogya Upanisad. The first is the famous sarvam khalv idam brahma:

automatically known? By knowing clay, one knows all objects made of clay. The modification is but a name based on words, and the clay alone is real."56 
The Śrutis do not refer to any personal form in this verse. They mention simply the Immensity (brhat) that is the Source of cosmic creation and dissolution. Clay is the origin of clay pots. When the pots break, they turn back into clay. Clay has form and the ability to be the source of clay pots. Brahman, which is being compared to clay, must also have energy to give rise to the cosmos. 
Therefore, Brahman ultimately informs us of Bhagavan, since Brahman itself is without the manifest energies, will or knowledge to create. 
bac 
The example of clay applies because both Brahman and clay share the common quality of being the source either of the material cos- mos or of earthly pots, respectively. The purpose of describing Brah- man here is to define Bhagavan. So, by pointing out this general char- acteristic of Brahman, Bhagavan has also been defined. 
The Śrutis here make use of a poetic device called arthäntara- nyasa - to establish one meaning by defining something else. Kavi Karṇapūra defines arthāntara-nyasa in Alankara-kaustubha 8.168: 
When a general instance is corroborated by a particular one, or vice versa, either through resemblance or contrast, such an aesthetic embellishment is called arthäntara-nyasa.7 
The following example may be given to show how a specific instance is used to support a general principle: 
O lotus-eyed beauty! You yourself were blind with love for Govinda, and so you made a gift to Him of your body. Yet now you are being miserly with your glances. Does one bicker about the goad after already selling the elephant? (Padyavali 198, BRS 2.4.114)58

abr In this example, Radha's sakhi explains a general principle about quibbling over trivial matters after the most difficult tasks have already been dealt with. She introduces the specific case of haggling over the price of a goad, i.e., the stick used to control an elephant, after the elephant has already been sold. 
Similarly, in SB 10.87.15, the principle asserted is that descrip- tions of the Supreme Truth, no matter how indirect, still lead ulti- mately to Bhagavan. The arthantara-nyasa, or introduction of an apparently unrelated matter, is that of the footsteps of men walking on the earth.ran laitement pros 
Brahman is the generic manifestation of Bhagavan, as it has no manifest characteristics. Brahman is described as the cause of the cosmos to help us understand Bhagavan. If Brahman is the cause, it must have potency, as an impotent object cannot be the cause of the cosmos. One who is inclusive of, or self-endowed with, potency is called Bhagavan, or the possessor of energies (bhaga). 
Thus, the Śrutis say that no matter whether a man is ignorant or wise, when he takes a step, his foot falls nowhere else but on the ground. Similarly, whatever the Śruti may establish, its ulti- mate purpose is to glorify Bhagavan alone, as He is the substratum of everything, including Brahman. All names of the Absolute refer ultimately to Bhagavan, in the same way that all rivers finally reach the sea, though they may at times flow in the opposite direction.

In this way, it was stated that the Lord alone, either as Bhagavan or as Brahman, is accessible through all the Vedas, both by their implicit meaning (tatparya) and by their direct meaning (abhid- hāna). And this is real, not imaginary. To convey this, the Śrutis sing:

Therefore, O Lord of the Three, the wise dive into the nectar ocean of Your topics, which destroy the contamination of all the worlds, and thus they give up all ascetic practices (tapas).

“O Presiding Lord of the Three ! The Master of Brahmā, Visnu and Śiva is the Puruşa called Nārāyaṇa, who is the source of all avataras, such as these guṇāvatāras; and You are Bhagavan, the Overlord, because Your essential nature is beyond even His. Therefore, O Supreme Controller, because the conclusion of the Vedas lies only in You, through both direct (abhidha) and implicit (tātparya ) statements, the wise (sūrayah), i.e., those who have awakened discrimination, forsake even that portion of the Vedas which describes You circuitously. Instead, 'they dive exclusively into the nectar ocean of Your topics' (tavākhila-loka- mala-ksapana-kathāmrtābdhim), i.e, they faithfully relish only the ocean of Your nectarean glories, which are the cause of eras- ing the sins of all the worlds.

If such is the case for practitioners, then what can be said of those who, "in the light of their own essential being, have completely rid themselves of conditioned patterns of thought, time and the gunas” (sva-dhāma-vidhutāśaya-kāla-gunāh), ie, who through the manifestation of their true nature as the pure self, have tran- scended identification with the quantum of mind, ego and intel- lect, who have conquered the influence of time, which causes old age and so on, and who have become free from the material guņas, such as sattva. Furthermore, they worship that aspect (pada) of Yourself that is experienced as perpetual bliss, the tattva called Brahman. Such persons also dive into that [sweet ocean of Kṛṣṇa's pastimes] and give up [ascetic practices or works].

What does this imply? The purport is that they would also give up their exclusive fixation on the experience of Brahman.

The following is to be said here: There are three types of men - the ignorant, the discriminating and the accomplished. It is seen that in texts intended for all three classes, the Vedas indicate that Bhagavan is not imaginary. Were it not so, the narrations of Bha- gavan, which are embedded in the Vedas, would be stripped of connection to a factual Reality. As such, the celebrated power of these narrations to dispel the sins even of the ignorant, who have 
98098 The Vedic Sound Reveals Bhagavan 
no knowledge of the words and their meaning, would be false, just as iron that is out of contact with fire has no ability to burn.enf

Moreover, were these tales referring to an imaginary entity, men of discrimination would take no stock in hearing them, just as they would not bother to hear of the good qualities of a barren lady's son [which is, of course, an absurdity]. Even if they did somehow engage in hearing such tales, they would never abandon their own religious duties [on their account], any more than one would abandon regular ritual service at other holy places simply upon hearing that the fame of their king has been equated to that of the Ganges.

And again, if this were the case, those who have become sup- remely accomplished by becoming self-realized ātmārāmas would certainly not immerse themselves in such stories, dis- counting their own experience, just as a person who is submerged in a pool of nectar would not leave it to swim in a river that has been merely attributed with superior qualities through hearsay.

T 
The scriptures confirm that the Lord's katha actually has all these characteristics. For example, Visnu Purāṇa states, "Upon entering the ear, Śrī Hari destroys one's sins" (VP 6.8.57).60 In this very chapter of Śrīmad Bhāgavatam, it is said: "One who knows You no longer feels the influence of good and bad results arising from past pious and sinful acts, since they are meted out by You. Such a realized devotee also disregards the Vedic commandments

meant for those still caught in identification with the body-mind. Those who every day fill their ears with Your glories, which are recited in every age through an unbroken tradition, attain You, the personification of salvation" (SB 10.87.40).61 
प्रथमे “हरेर्गुणाक्षिप्तमतिः” (भा० १।७।११) इत्यादौ च । 
And in the First Canto: "The venerable Sukadeva, the son of Śrīla Vyasadeva and ever-beloved of the devotees of Viṣṇu, his mind having been captivated by Śri Hari's attributes, studied this great narration [of Bhagavatam] every day" (SB 1.7.11).62 
तस्माद् गुणानां गुणादिप्रतिपादकवेदानां च भगवता सम्बन्धः स्वाभाविक एव सर्वथेति सिद्धम् । 
So it has been proven that both the Lord's attributes and the Vedas that propound them, have an eternal, natural relationship with Bhagavan. 
अत्र श्रुतयः “ॐ आस्य जानन्त” (ऋग्वेद १।१५६।३) इत्याद्याः “यथा पुष्करपलाशमापो न श्लिष्यन्ति एवमेवं विदन् पापं कर्म न श्लिष्यति” ( छा० ४ । १४ । ३) “न कर्मणा लिप्यते पापकेन” (बृ० ४।४।२३) “तत्सुकृतदुष्कृते विधुनुते” (कौषीतकि० ४) “एतं ह वाव न तपति किमहं साधु नाकरवं किमहं पापमकरवम्” ( तै० २।९) इत्याद्याः । “मुक्ता ह्येनमुपासत" इत्याद्याश्च । 
There are a number of Vedic statements confirming this, such as, "O Śrī Viṣṇu, Your name is conscious and illuminating" (RV 1.156.3);63 "Just as water does not adhere to a lotus leaf, a sinful act cannot bind one who knows the Lord" (CHU 4.14.3);64 "He is not affected by sinful acts" (BAU 4.4.23);65 "Transcendental

Similarly, other statements dealing specifically with the topic of worship are necessarily to be applied, in their rightful sense, as signifiers of the superiority of Bhagavan. With this in mind [since it is already a given that such verses concern Bhagavan], I am not quoting such verses here. 
Commentary 
The sole purpose of the Vedas is to glorify Bhagavan. Such glories are not imaginary, as the Śrutis confirm in the main verse (SB 10.87.16) of this section. Were they imaginary, the words of the Vedas would not have the power to purify anyone. But it is seen that even foolish people are purified by hearing the Lord's pastimes. 
People of discrimination, who study and adhere to the Vedas, know them to be real and give up their mundane duties to engage in the service of the Lord after hearing of His glories. This would not happen if they were imaginary, just as no sane man would attempt to bathe in the fame of a king upon hearing that it is as pure as the Ganges. Moreover, self-satisfied and liberated sages (ātmārāmas) would never take to hearing the Lord's pastimes if they were imag- inary. This would be like renouncing an empire for a non-existent hut that someone has glorified in a novel somewhere. Authorita- tive scriptures offer ample proof that the Lord's name and quali- ties purify whoever comes in contact with them. Their narrations captivate even self-realized beings.

An objection is raised: According to your doctrine, since the Lord can be described by words, does that not make Him material? Moreover, do the Śrutis themselves not also deny that He can be defined by words in statements like, "Words, along with the mind, turn away, being unable to attain Him" (TU 2.4.1);69 "He spoke, yet without words;"" "That [Truth] is not revealed by speech, but it makes speech possible" (KENA 1.5);" and, "The [Absolute] is that which the ear cannot hear, but because of which the ear is able to hear" (KENA 1.8)."2 This doubt is answered as follows: 
doubt is 
यथा साक्षान्निर्देश्यत्वे दोषस्तथा लक्ष्यत्वेऽपि कथं न स्यात् ? उभयत्रापि शब्दवृत्तिविष- यत्वेनाविशेषात् । किं च न तस्य प्राकृतवत् साक्षान्निर्देश्यत्वं किन्त्वनिर्देश्यत्वेनैव तथा निर्देश्यत्वमिति सिद्धान्त्यते । 
If it is considered a defect that Brahman can be directly expressed with words, then how would it not also be a defect if it could be indirectly expressed? There is no difference, since in both cases Brahman would be the object of the meaning of words (sabda- vṛtti). Moreover, Brahman may not be directly expressible in words like a material object, but it may be concluded that it is expressible only by statements that point out its inexpressibility

With this intent, the Śrutis offer their concluding statement:

Because You are without end or limit, the cosmic administrators [such as Brahma] simply cannot find any limit to You. Moreover, even You cannot do so. Under the influence of time, the count- less universes, each enveloped in its own seven-layered covering, float contemporaneously within You, like particles of dust in the sky. For this reason, we Śrutis, whose final conclusion is in You Malone, become successful by revealing You indirectly, through oel the method of negating everything that is not You.

अत्र स्वरूपगुणयोर्द्वयोरपि द्विधैवानिर्देश्यत्वम् । आनन्त्येन इदमित्थं तदिति निर्देशासम्भ- वेन च । 
Both the svarupa and guna of the Lord are inexpressible in two ways: (1) due to being unlimited, and, (2) due to the impossibil- ity of defining Him by saying, "He is this," or, "He is like that." 
तत्र प्रथममानन्त्यमाहुः – हे भगवन् । ते तव अन्तमेतावत्त्वं द्युपतयः स्वर्गादिलोकपतयो ब्रह्मादयोऽपि न ययुर्न विदुः ।

The Śrutis first confirm the inexpressibility of that which is unlimited: "O Supreme Lord! Even the cosmic administra- tors (dyu-patayah), who control the heavenly planets and other realms, such as Brahma, can never reach Your end or know Your measure."

The Śrutis reply: "Because of Your being unlimited, or in other words, specifically because of the non-existence of any end in You. Ignorance of the horns of a hare [i.e., of a non-existent object] is not a defect in omniscience, and the inability to acquire such a non-existent object is not a defect in omnipotence. The Vedas also confirm, 'My son, He who is the overseer exists in the spiritual sky; He may know Himself or He may not" (RV 10.130.18).4

Oh, how astonishing! The multitude of universal eggs along with their coverings, which are seven in number, each of which is ten times greater that the preceding one, float about or wander within You, made to do so by the wheel of time, just like dust particles in the sky. They wander in You contemporane- ously, and not sequentially, i.e., one after the other.

This shows that Bhagavan's svarupa is unlimited, because the unlimited universes wander within it. Because these unlimited universes are the shelter of unlimited wonderful qualities, it is understood that the Lord's qualities are also unlimited. The Śrutis also confirm this in statements such as, "O Gargi, that which is above heaven and below the earth, that which consti- tutes heaven and earth as well as what lies between them, and all that ever was, is and will be, that, they say, is pervaded by the Lord" (BAU 3.8.4).75 And, "Even a person who could count all the dust particles of the earth could not possibly enumerate the glory of Sri Visņu" (RV 1.154.1)," and so on.

Because You are as depicted above, the Śrutis find their fruition in You. They do so by first describing You somehow and to some extent, and then precisely by disclosing that You are unlimited, they ultimately culminate in You. Thus, after describing the bliss that is a hundred times superior to the bliss of präjäpatya (pro- creative power), by stating, "Words, along with the mind, turn away, being unable to attain Him,"" TU 2.4.1 indicates that Brah- man's inherent bliss, being unlimited, is beyond any number expressible through words.

The "non-That" (atat) means phenomenal objects; only by negation of the phenomenal do the Śrutis culminate in You.

Moreover, He is directly specified by statements like [those given above], "Brahman is truth and knowledge," and, "He naturally possesses knowledge, will and agency.' Consequently, His attributes, such as knowledge, are different from those of phe- nomena, and thus, when the Śrutis use words like jñāna, it is the non-transcendent jñāna only that they reject (atan-nirasanena) and so culminate in Him. So, because He is inaccessible to the intelligence, He is said to be inexpressible (anirdeśya), and yet because it can be said that "He has some form," He is also expressible (nirdeśya).

Just as in direct perception through words, simply by hearing the statement, "You are the tenth," accurate knowledge of the tenth person is ascertained, so also that self-luminous entity, the Sup- reme Lord, becomes manifest in the pure heart [through the state- ments of the Vedas], and this shows that the words of the Śrutis are the embodiment of the self-luminous potency. This is also stated [several times] in Bhagavatam, "Both sabda-brahma and

param brahma are my eternal forms" (SB 6.16.51);86 "Because the Vedas are the body of the Lord" (SB 11.3.43); 87 "We have heard that the Veda is directly the self-existing Nārāyaṇa" (SB 6.1.40); 88 and, "What need is there for any other literature? As soon as one atten- tively and submissively hears the message of Bhāgavatam, the Lord immediately becomes arrested within his heart" (SB 1.1.2). Therefore, the Śruti mantra, "I ask You about that being who is to be known only from the Upanisads" (BAU 3.9.26), informs us that He can be understood only through the Upanisads, just as form can be perceived only by the eye. Consequently, just as the self- effulgent sun dispels darkness and thus reveals itself, the Lord, dispelling all material objects through His self-luminous potency in the form of the Śruti, manifests Himself.

As such, His definability is also not due to the Śruti. It is not appropriate to say that the sun illumines itself by its own light in the way that it illuminates a clay pot, because the sunlight is nondifferent from the sun. Even if one holds that there is a difference between energy and its Energetic Source, the Lord can still be expressed by words, because it is exactly through the statements of its inexpressibility, that it is in fact positively expressed.

The fact that Brahman is disclosed through the potency of Bha- gavän does not negate its own self-luminosity, because Brahman is nondifferent from Bhagavan. Whatever instruction about the Absolute is imparted, even through vernacular speech, is also pos- sible due to its attaining correspondence with the Lord through the blessings of those Śrutis. This is even more so when those words are themselves outward manifestations of ecstasy (anub- hāva) arising as spontaneous effects of pure devotion, during the culture of loving service to Bhagavan. This cannot be negated, because such words are certainly a manifestation of the Lord's internal potency. What then can be said of the words that are a direct manifestation of the Lord's own mind [i.e., the words of the Śruti]? Thus, [the proposition that Bhagavan can be described in words] is irreproachable.

Commentary 
98 The Vedic Sound Reveals Bhagavān 
Wristngen 
An objection arises: If Bhagavan can be described in words, He must be like any material object that is described in words. Besides, there are many statements in the Upanisads that emphatically deny that words can approach the Absolute. In response to this, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī cites the last prayer of the Śrutis. Bhagavan is said to be indescribable because He is unlimited and cannot be described com- pletely. He does not know His own limit because He has none. One is not considered ignorant if he is without knowledge of the fruit of a sandalwood tree, because there is no such fruit. 
sidentmolit 
The form and qualities of Bhagavan are unlimited, and since the Śrutis cannot fathom them completely, they sometimes say that the Lord cannot be described. On the other hand, there are numerous statements depicting the attributes and actions of Bhagavan, such "The Lord is inherently self-endowed with knowledge, will and working power" (svābhāvikī jñāna-bala-kriya ca, śu 6.8). 
beg 
The phrase atan-nirasanena bhavan-nidhanah (the Śrutis, follow- ing their method of negating everything that is not the Absolute - lit., the "non-That" reveal You as their final conclusion) means that the Lord's knowledge, will and power are not material and can become manifest simply on the strength of revealed sound. 
Ten simple illiterate villagers went to a city festival, and before returning, one decided to take a head count to make sure that no one was being left behind in that strange city. The villager counted nine and could not understand who was missing. He counted again, but reaching the same number asked another to count. Each one that took the task forgot to include himself. Thinking one of their party was missing, they went to make a report. The officer counted, and when he reached the chief villager, he said, "And you are the tenth." When they heard this, they realized no one was missing. Their igno- rance had to be dispelled by someone outside their group. This is called daśamas-tvam-asi-nyaya, the principle of "You are the tenth." In this example, the statement "You are the tenth" imparts direct knowledge of the tenth person. Usually the knowledge we derive from a statement is indirect. Direct knowledge comes through the 
993 
cognitive senses. 
ve Śri Bhagavat Sandarbha 
In the same way, Vedic sound directly reveals the Lord to a qual- ified student through the mercy of the spiritual teacher. Śrī Kṛṣṇa told Arjuna: 
de 
deme 
I shall now disclose this most confidential knowledge to you, who are devoid of envy. When you come to know it and realize it, you shall be freed of all inauspiciousness. (GĪTĀ 9.1)9% 
Bhagavan is said to be indescribable, yet by His own potency He reveals Himself in the Śrutis. One may say that the sun is non- illuminable owing to being illumined by its own potency. Only if we entertain a difference between the sun and its rays can we say that the sun is illumined by the sun rays. Similarly, as there is no dif- ference between the Energetic Source, Bhagavan, and His energy, the Supreme Lord is called indescribable, because the Śrutis that describe Him do so only by His potency. When, however, the Ener- getic Source is viewed as distinct from His energies, He is then said to be describable by the Śrutis. 
The doubt may be raised that Brahman lacks manifest qualities, so how can the Śrutis describe it? The answer is that Brahman, like Bhagavan, is also described and realized by the potency of Bhagavan, being nondifferent from Him. There is no medium other than Vedic sound to realize or describe Brahman.alliy stestilli slymis nsT 
Just as when a diamond is found in a mine, it needs to be pro- cessed to remove the unwanted matter around it, in the same way the Śrutis describe the Lord by denying any materialism in Him. This process is referred to as atan-nirasana in the chief verse of this section. Atat means material (or the non-transcendent) and nirasana means denial. The Śrutis describe the Lord either by deny- ing that the Absolute has material qualities, actions or forms, or by affirming that the Absolute has transcendent qualities, actions or forms. In either case, these descriptions culminate in the revela- tion of the Lord, just as the fruit of a tree falls on the ground when matured.

98 The Vedic Sound Reveals Bhagavan 
Even the words of an ordinary mortal can describe Bhagavan if he or she is graced by the power of the Śrutis. This means that only those instructions consistent with Vedic statements have the power to reveal the Lord. The devotees of the Lord who have achieved the grace of a spiritual teacher coming in an authorized paramparā have the power to reveal the Lord in their writings, which have potency like the Vedic mantras. The Lord is said to be indefinable only because He is unlimited and unapproachable by material sound. The conclusion is that the Vedas are able to define the Lord. 
Up to this point, it has been described that Bhagavan is the Abso- lute Reality in its feature of highest completion, which has two other manifestations, called Paramātmā and Brahman. Bhagavān possesses various types of energies, and therefore, He also performs various actions. These are described in the Vedic sound. 
In the following anuccheda, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi will give more details about the energies of the Lord, in particular, Lakṣmi. The Lord's energies, by virtue of being part of His inherent nature, contain in their essence the transcendental attributes of divine personhood, just like the Lord. 3 28 nanimobang ateixs 91016 si in less er darantuar od of awone noad ved abis Tambang

THE ONE ABSOLUTE NATURE exists both as energy and as Ener- getic Source. It has also been explained that when this Absolute Nature exists predominantly as Energetic Source, whose poten- cies have been shown to be intrinsic to its essential nature, it takes the name Bhagavan. When the same nature exists predomi- nantly as energy, it takes the name Lakṣmi. To demonstrate this, we will show some of Her aspects, which are unlimited because of Her innumerable functions. Śri Suka says:

Here Śakti means the intrinsic energy in the form of Mahalakṣmi. The supreme internal energy of Bhagavan is the entity denoted by the primary meaning of the word sakti. And Maya is the exter- nal energy. The other energies, like Śrī, are indeed various man- ifestations of these two, because the scriptures divide all of them into the categories of material and transcendental potencies. It should be understood, therefore, that all of these, beginning with Śrī, have two facets - as a manifestation of Sakti [the internal potency] and as a manifestation of Maya [the external potency]. 
तत्र पूर्वस्या भेदः – श्रीभगवती सम्पत् न त्वियं महालक्ष्मीरूपा तस्या मूलशक्तित्वात् । तदग्रे विवरणीयम् । 
In the first category, Śri is the Lord's splendor, a facet of His inter- nal potency (bhagavati-sampat). This Śrī, however, is not the orig- inal goddess Herself, Mahalakṣmi, as She is the fountainhead of all potencies. This will be described later on.

In the second category, Śrī is material wealth [a manifestation of the external potency]. It is in reference to her that Pṛthu Mahā- raja prayed to the Lord, "Being absorbed in Your svarupa, what need have You of [Śri]?" (SB 4.20.28), and the Lord told the Kuma- ras, "Though I am indifferent to her, Śrī never abandons Me" (SB 3.16.7). For Narada also says at the end of the Fourth Canto: 
श्रियमनुचरतीं तदर्थिनश्च द्विपदपतीन् विबुधांश्च यत् स्वपूर्णः ।

and is a special manifestation of the bliss of love, premănanda, embodied in foundational loving emotions, such as those of the Lord's mother. Therefore, in Tapani-śruti, the Lord is called, "One who induces in the gopis the energy of avidya, or the absence of awareness [of His intimacy-impeding grandeur]" (GTU 1.8). This will be expanded on in a suitable place? Avidya as a branch of māyā is a special covering potency, which causes the conditioned beings to forget their own svarupa. roti sontelbats galalams

The word ca (also) in the verse indicates further divisions of the internal energy, such as sandhini (existence), samvit (knowl- edge), hladini (bliss), bhakti (devotion), adhāra-śakti (the potency of underlying support), murti (form), vimală (purity), jayā (celebrity), yoga (union), prahvi (submissive responsiveness), iśānā (controllership) and anugraha (compassion). Out of these, sandhini (existence) is the same as satya (eternal being); jaya (celebrity) is utkarṣiņi (fame); yoga is Yogamaya (she who induces union); and samvit is the energy known as jñāna (knowledge), ajñāna (ignorance) and suddha-sattva (unalloyed being). Prahvi, or "submissive responsiveness," is the basis of the ability for unlimited variety; iśānā (controllership) is the energy by virtue of which the Lord is the supreme authority. These are their divisions.

In other words, it seems as though they have been completely attained in You, for all objectives, such as wealth, and so on, already exist within You in their fullness, eternally.

[Narada answers:] "By Your effulgence," or in other words, by the influence of Your svarupa-sakti, "the constantly flowing stream of the gunas of māyā comes to a halt." This means that You keep the gunas and the chain of their reactions forever distant. Śrī Kubera similarly said, "The Lord is both endowed with and devoid of saktis, which are constituted either of His own essential nature (atma-māyā), or of the gunas of material nature (guna-mayi)" (SB 4.12.6).10 That is, He is endowed with the potencies that are inherent to His essential nature, and devoid of the potencies consisting of the material gunas. We take shelter of that Lord. boyslgaib go, idquod uox satasudh

the indwelling (antaryami) Purușa. How are You to be described? You are "the controller," meaning that You are Your own sup- port through the power of Your own internal potency (svarupa- śakti). In spite of being self-situated, You have brought into being, through Your own potency of māyā (ātma-māyā), the endless varieties, or forms, conceived (kalpana) by You. Atmā here should be taken to mean the living being (jivātmā), and so ātma-māyā refers to the māyā whose subject is the jiva. Alternatively, ātma- māyā can be understood as the Lord's internal potency (svarupa- śakti), by virtue of which the Lord is His own support. In this case, māyā-śakti itself is understood as the Lord's kalpana [lit., as His imagination, or a projection of His mind], by which He has created unlimited variety.

What kind of being are You? At present, or in other words, at this time of Your appearance, since even that Iśvara is subsumed within You, Bhagavan, You display a human form for the sake of Your own play, by manifesting simultaneously both these won- derful potencies [i.e., the svarupa and maya-śaktis]. As the Smrti states, "The Parabrahman has a human form."" This human form is called Bhagavan. The verb abhyattaḥ [You manifested] can be broken down into its constituents: You brought or displayed (atta) [this human form], before (abhi) Your devotees.

An alternative explanation of the principal verse in this section (SB 10.39.55) can be given by taking the word śaktyä (by energy) as the substantive throughout [and the other names as its mod- ifiers]. In this case, Śrī would refer to the original energy, and the other energies, beginning with Pusți, would be Her portions. Vidya is knowledge, and a-vidya13 refers to complete knowledge, which is devotional service, as stated in GITA 9.2, "This wisdom is the king of all knowledge and confidential truths."1 Māyā is the external energy, and her manifestations, [also named] Śrī, and so on, are to be understood as different from the above [transcendental] energies. The rest of the verse is as given previ- ously.

In this Sandarbha, wherein Bhagavan is described purely, the functions of His internal potency (svarupa-śakti) are assessed with regard to that in which they culminate [e.g., the vidya potency culminates in awareness of the Lord]. In this regard, the following deliberation is made: First of all, the Absolute Reality, which is one only, also has only one energy, yet it is divided into three because He is sac-cid-ananda. This is stated by Śri Dhruva in Visnu Purana:

The one energy, having the three divisions of hladini (bliss), sand- Youhini (eternal existence) and samvit (knowing), exists in You, the support of everything. But the energy that yields material hap- piness, misery and their mixture, does not abide in You, because You are free from the gunas. (VP 1.12.69) 15 
व्याख्यातं च स्वामिभिः - ह्लादिनी आह्लादकरी सन्धिनी सन्तता संविद् विद्याशक्तिः । एका मुख्या अव्यभिचारिणी स्वरूपभूतेति यावत् । सा सर्वसंस्थितौ सर्वस्य सम्यक् स्थि- तिर्यस्मात् तस्मिन् सर्वाधिष्ठानभूते त्वय्येव न तु जीवेषु । जीवेषु च या गुणमयी त्रिविधा सा त्वयि नास्ति । 
Śrīdhara Svāmi comments: "Hladini bestows delight, sandhini is existence, and samvit is the cognitive potency. Eka (one) means predominant, undeviating and intrinsic to the Lord's essential nature. This energy is present in You only, the support of every- thing (sarva-samsthiti), or in other words, the one from whom all things come into being. This potency, however, is not present in the living beings. Moreover, the energy consisting of the three material gunas, which is present in the living beings," is not in You." 
तामेवाह - ह्लादतापकरी मिश्रेति । ह्लादकरी मनःप्रसादोत्था सात्त्विकी । तापकरी विषयवियोगादिषु तापकरी तामसी । तदुभयमिश्रा विषयजन्या राजसी । तत्र हेतुः सत्त्वा- दिगुणवर्जिते । तदुक्तं सर्वज्ञसूक्तौ - 
Śri Dhruva further describes this [latter] energy, "which yields material happiness, misery and their mixture" (hlada-tāpa-karī miśra). Hlada-kari means the "energy generated from mental contentment" and is of the nature of sattva-guna; tāpa-kari is the energy which elicits misery due to the loss of sense objects and belongs to tamo-guna; and the mixture of these two (miśra), which arises from sense objects, is of the nature of rajo-guna. The reason why they are absent in the Lord is that He is free from the guņas, beginning with sattva. This is stated in the Sarvajña-sūkta: 
15 hladini sandhini samvit tvayy ekä sarva-samśraye 
hlada-tāpa-kari miśra tvayi no guna-varjite

The energies sandhini, samvit and hladini should be understood as progressively superior. As such, that potency by which He Himself sustains His own existence and bestows existence upon others, and which pervades all space, time, objects and so on, is called sandhini. This is so because the Lord is the source-condition underlying the cognition of all existing objects, like the pot-ness of a pot, and is sometimes spoken of in scriptures as the essence of existence (sat), as in the Chandogya mantra where He is indicated by the word sat, "My dear boy, in the beginning there was only this sat" (CHU 6.2.1).18 Similarly, though He is the embodiment of cognition (samvit), that potency by which He knows and induces others to know is called samvit. In the same way, although He is the embodiment of hlada (delight), which is the summum bonum of samvit, the energy by which He experiences this delight and causes others to experience it, is called hladini. This is how these three divisions of the internal potency should be distinguished.

Thus, it has been established that the original energy has three subdivisions. The specific function of this energy, which is characterized by self-luminosity, is that by which the [Bhaga- vān's] essential nature (svarupa), or His essential energy itself (svarupa-śakti), or His form qualified by virtue of the svarupa- śakti, becomes manifest. This energy is known as "completely pure being" (viśuddha-sattva). It is indeed samvit, because it is endowed with the functions of knowing and revealing knowl- edge, illuminating Him without dependence on anything else. And because it is untouched by māyā [the external energy], it is called viśuddha, or completely pure.

When this selfsame viśuddha-sattva is predominated by its sand- hini aspect, it is called adhara-sakti, or the potency of underlying support. When predominated by samvit, it is called atma-vidyā, self-knowledge. When predominated by the essence of hladini, it is called guhya-vidya ("concealed knowledge," i.e., pure devo- tion). When all three potencies are prominent at the same time, it is called murti, or the form of the Lord.

Through self-knowledge (ātma-vidyā), which has two functions, characterized by knowledge and the effecting of knowledge, the viśuddha-sattva reveals knowledge relevant to the worshiper, which is its function. Similarly, through concealed knowl- edge (guhya-vidyā), which also has two functions, characterized by devotion and the effecting of devotion, the viśuddha-sattva reveals pure devotion of the nature of unalloyed love, which is its function. Both of these are elucidated in Visnu Purana in the prayers to Lakṣmi: 
यज्ञविद्या महाविद्या गुह्यविद्या च शोभते । 
आत्मविद्या च देवि त्वं विमुक्तिफलदायिनी ॥ ४९१ ॥ इति ।

Yajña-vidyā (knowledge of sacrifice) means rituals. Mahā-vidyā refers to the eightfold yoga discipline. Guhya-vidya means bhakti. ātma-vidyā is self-knowledge or awareness ( jñāna ). Because You (Laksmi) are the shelter of all these, You embody them. Therefore, You are the bestower of the fruit of the various types of liberation as well as other results.

Truth. It is this function which is also called vasudeva. This is explained by Lord Mahadeva: 
सत्त्वं विशुद्धं वसुदेवशब्दितं यदीयते तत्र पुमानपावृतः । 
सत्त्वे च तस्मिन् भगवान् वासुदेवो ह्यधोक्षजो मे मनसा विधीयते ॥ ४९२ ॥ इति । 
The state of unalloyed being, viśuddha-sattva, is called vasudevay because the Personal God is unveiled therein. In this state of tw being, this Bhagavan, who is Vasudeva and beyond the ken of the material senses, can be meditated on within the mind. (SB 4.3.23)21

This verse is to be understood as follows: The adjective viśuddha (unalloyed) means completely or especially pure [being], devoid of even a trace of insentience owing to its being a manifestation of svarupa-sakti. This state of unalloyed being, viśuddha-sattva, is called vasudeva. On what basis can this state of being be said to have the nature of sattva or of vasudeva? In answer, Lord Siva says, "Because it is in this state (tatra) that the Personal God, Vasudeva, is unveiled." So, from this statement it is evident that this state of being is endowed with the nature of sattva, the first of the two qualities mentioned above, because, like the well-known sattva-guna [of material nature], it is instrumental in making the unperceived perceptible. ad

Lord, is derived etymologically as "that which exists, or in other words, that which is perceived, in the state of vasudeva." And it is a fact that He is perceived in viśuddha-sattva. Therefore, the meaning of the root word (vasudeva) is determined by the mean- ing conveyed through application of the well-known particular suffix [to the root word], which meaning is implicit in its well- known derivative. 
ततश्च वासयति देवमिति व्युत्पत्त्या वा वसत्यस्मिन्निति वा वसुः । तथा दीव्यति द्योतत इति देवः । स चासौ स चेति वासुदेवः । “धर्म इष्टं धनं नृणाम्” (भा० ११ । १९ । ३९) इति स्वय- म्भगवदुक्तेर्वसुभिर्भगवद्धर्मलक्षणैर्धनैः प्रकाशत इति वा वासुदेवः । तस्माद् वसुदेवशब्दितं विशुद्धसत्त्वम् । 
By etymological derivation, the word vasu means that which enables the Lord to reside, or that in which the Lord dwells; and deva means one who sports or shines. So, one who embodies both dwelling in unalloyed being (vasu) and infinite play or effulgence (deva) is Vasudeva. Alternatively, vasu is defined as wealth, and in particular, the wealth of dedication to the path of Bhagavan, known as bhagavad-dharma (i.e., "devotional service in prac- tice"), as the Lord Himself said, "The most desirable wealth22 for human beings is dharma" (SB 11.19.39).23 Thus, in this sense, Vasudeva is one who is effulgent with [deva], or makes mani- fest, the wealth [vasu] of bhagavad-dharma. For the above-stated reasons, viśuddha-sattva is called Vasudeva. id

Knowledge of oneness (kaivalya) is in sattva-guna, knowledge rooted in the oscillation between alternatives is in rajo-guna, and ow nd knowledge of mere phenomena is in tamo-guna. Knowledge that is resolute upon Me, however, is understood to be free from the gunas. (SB 11.25.24)24

From this it is clear that the word viśuddha signifies that this sat- tva has the characteristic of self-luminosity, which is inherent in the svarupa-sakti. Therefore, in the phrase, "He is revealed in sat- tva," the locative case actually intends the instrumental case, i.e., "He is revealed by sattva." 
स्वरूपशक्तिवृत्तित्वमेव विशदयति- अपावृत आवरणशून्यः सन् प्रकाशते । प्राकृतं सत्त्वं चेत् तर्हि तत्र प्रतिफलनमेवावसीयते । ततश्च दर्पणे मुखस्येव तदन्तर्गततया तस्य तत्रावृ- तत्वेनैव प्रकाशः स्यादिति भावः ।

nevezena to also add co [In the verse under discussion, Mahadeva] further clarifies how viśuddha-sattva is a function of the svarupa-sakti by use of the word "unveiled" (apāvṛta). This word means that the Lord man- ifests without any covering. If material sattva were indicated, then the form perceived in it would be merely a reflection. The significance of this is that, like the image of a face reflected in a mirror, the form of the Lord manifest in material sattva would necessarily be of a covered nature.

Some readings of the verse give namasă (through obeisances) in place of manasă, and anu in place of hi. In this case the mean- ing would be that the Lord, who is manifest exclusively through His self-luminous potency, called viśuddha-sattva, is served (anu- vidhiyate) only by acts such as paying obeisances, but is not man- ifest through anything else. So, even when the Lord is not visible, yet He makes His presence felt in consciousness, He can be served by us, even without being seen, by paying obeisances and other similar acts. In this way, the coherence of the topic is maintained even with the alternative reading.

Because the viśuddha-sattva that manifests the form of the Lord is specifically of the nature of murti (the potency of form) and of vasudeva (the potency of unalloyed being), therefore [in exact correspondence to this truth], the Lord, in one particular appear- ance, was born of the wife of Dharma, known as Murti, and 
1011 
Śri Bhagavat Sandarbha 
thus, in this instance, the quality of murti [i.e., that of supply- ing form] belongs to her. Similarly, [in Krsna's appearance, His father] Anakadundubhi is also named Vasudeva [and Kṛṣṇa first appeared in his pure mind, pervaded by viśuddha-sattva]. So, in this instance, the quality of vasudeva [i.e., that of being the unal- loyed ground of the Lord's appearance] is evidenced in him. This should be reflected upon.

In this context, the portions of Bhagavan's energies, manifested in the form of śraddhā (faith ), pusti ( nourishment) and so on, have been listed as the sister of Mūrti [in SB 4.1.49], which indi- cates that Murti too is a manifestation of a portion of Bhagavan's potency.

In the verse, "In the fourth avatara, the Lord appeared as the twin sages Nara and Nārāyana from Dharma's kalā” (SB 1.3.9), the word kala means potency, or sakti. So, because the Lord named Nara-Nārāyaṇa appeared from her, she being characterized as the Lord's sakti, she is certainly an embodiment of the suddha- sattva called vasudeva. For this reason alone was she named Murti. And without offering a detailed description of the other wives of Dharma, such as Śraddha, it is she alone who is depicted in the Fourth Canto: "Murti gave birth to the sages Nara and Nārāyana, the reservoir of all auspicious qualities” (SB 4.1.52 ) 25 Murti, from whom the Lord, the reservoir of all qualities, is born or appears, gave birth to both of them. This sentence has to be connected syntactically to the verb of the previous verse (asūta, 
25 mūrtih sarva-gunotpattir nara-nārāyanāvrst 
1012 
99 Laksmi Is the Energy of the Lord 
"gave birth," SB 4.1.51). The idea is that because she is instrumen- tal in the manifestation of the Lord's body, or murti, which is eternal, fully conscious and blissful, and is called Bhagavan, she is called Mürti.

Similarly, Śrī Kṛṣṇa's father, Śrīmad Anakadundubhi, should also be understood as a manifestation of suddha-sattva, because the Lord is seen to manifest from him, and also because his name is identical to that which denotes the state of suddha-sattva, i.e., Vasudeva. This is stated in the Ninth Canto, "Vasudeva, the abode of Śri Hari, is called Anakadundubhi" (SB 9.24.30).26 If Vasudeva is understood other than as a manifestation of suddha-sattva, the adjectival phrase, "the abode of Śrī Hari," would become insignificant.

In the same way, one should understand the appearance of Śrī and the other consorts of the Lord to take place through viśuddha- sattva, predominated in various degrees by one of its components, such as hladini. These energies have three forms: as opulence inherent to the Lord, as the transmitter of such opulence to those who are blessed by the Lord, and as a portion of that opulence. Furthermore, these energies should be known to have two fea- tures. As energy only, devoid of form, they exist in the state of "at-one-ment" with the Lord's form, and so on. As the presid- ing deities of these energies, they exist as associates of the Lord endowed with corresponding forms.

Commentary sunsodd eila hi sahi 144. preg iigid Süngreaybed Shaddad to noiselinace ale ni fat AFTER EXPLAINING that Bhagavan can be described by Vedic sound, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi discusses the Lord's energies. In Section 3, he explained that Bhagavan is naturally endowed with multifarious potencies. The Lord is a person and His energies are also per- sons. When Absolute Reality manifests predominantly as Energetic Source, it is called Bhagavan, and when manifest predominantly as energy, it is called Lakṣmi. Laksmi, the personification of the Lord's energy, exists as the transcendental female principal, and as the Lord's consort, She serves Him, who is the original male. Lakṣmi has various manifestations, some of which are described in the main verse in this section, SB 10.39.55. 
Sukadeva spoke this verse describing Akrura's vision, which occurred while the latter was taking Kṛṣṇa and Balarama to Math- urā. He had stopped to take a dip in the Yamuna River before his noon chanting of the Gayatri mantra, and upon entering the water, saw Śrī Kṛṣṇa being served by various sages, gods, devotees and energies. This verse names twelve of these energies. 
Jiva Gosvāmi says that these energies have their counterparts in the material world, which carry the same names though their func- tions and abilities are different. In Sanskrit literature, the words used to denote spiritual entities or actions are the same as those used for material objects or actions. The meaning of the words change according to the context. Such a facility in the Sanskrit language offers the capacity for a single verse to convey multiple layers of meaning. 
Generally, the word sakti indicates the internal potency, and māyā, the external potency. Śrī indicates opulence; pusti nour- ishes the body; gi is the controller of speech; kanti is beauty; kirti is fame; tusti is internal satisfaction; ila is the supporter of the earth; urjā is the lila potency; vidya bestows true knowledge; and avidya induces non-awareness of the Lord's grandeur (because awareness of majesty diminishes intimacy). All of these have counterparts in the material world. Jaya brings victory; and māyā is yoga-māyā in the spiritual domain and maha-māyā in the material world. In the 
1014 
99 Lakṣmi Is the Energy of the Lord 
spiritual domain, avidya covers devotees like Yasoda so that they do not think of Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Lord. Therefore, in Gopala-tāpani Upanisad, Śrī Kṛṣṇa is called gopi-janävidya-kala-preraka, or one who induces in the gopis the energy of non-awareness (of His grandeur). 
The energies called Satya, Utkarṣiņi, Prahvi, Iśānā and so on, which Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī mentions, are also listed by Lord Siva while speaking to Pārvati: 
In this way, the great Lord, the master of everyone, forever enjoys with His eternal consort Mahālakṣmi in the eternal transcendental Vonsky. To either side of them, seated on two beautiful seats are Dharaṇī and Nilä, and in the eight directions are the eight energies, begin- ning with Vimala, on the tips of the eight petals. Vimalā, Utakarṣiņi, Jñānā, Kriya, Yoga, Prahvi, Satya and Iśānā are all potencies of the Lord. (PP 6.228.47-49)27 
The Śrī mentioned by Pṛthu Mahārāja (SB 4.20.28) and by the Lord (SB 3.16.7) is not the eternal consort of the Lord. She is the per- sonification of material opulence, and that is why the Lord says that He has no interest in her. This Śri was once destroyed by the curse of Śrī Durvāsā Muni. The narration is found in VP 1.9 and has already been described in Section 45.1.

Later on, the gods churned the ocean, and Lakṣmi, the eternal consort of Śrī Vişņu, appeared from it. She revived the opulence of the three worlds by Her merciful glance: 
The Goddess of Fortune, by Her favorable and merciful glance, increased the opulence of the three worlds, along with their inhabitants and their directors, the devas. (SB 8.8.25)28

from the puruṣāvatāras, even though she takes shelter in and is dependent on Them. Śrī Brahmã experienced this: 
lo 
Bewildered by the Lord's maya, fools haughtily speak of their body as the self and of their possessions as "mine," even though Mäyä herself feels too shy even to stand in front of the Lord. (SB 2.5.13)29 
Māyā and her various manifestations influence only the jiva. The Lord is completely transcendental to her through the influence of His internal potency (antaranga-śakti), which has three principal divisions: the potency of ever-present being, sandhini, the potency of immediate tacit knowing, samvit, and the potency of supercon- scious delight, hladini. These three potencies do not exist in the con- ditioned beings, who are covered by māyā. This is a very important philosophical principle stated by Śri Jiva Gosvāmi. 
Most Neo-Vedanta as well as New Age spiritualists share the pop- ular understanding that everything — all knowledge, love and so on - is inherent within the living being. It is simply lying in a covered or dormant state and can be unleashed by spiritual prac- tice. Many modern inspirational teachers, like Anthony Roberts, author of Awaken the Giant Within, actively propound this miscon- ception. This idea is highly appealing, because it creates a sense of independence and self-sufficiency. But, unfortunately, the reality is different, as stated by Dhruva. 
Māyā also has three divisions - tamas, rajas and sattva - and these are not found in the Lord. They form a hierarchy, as Sūta Gosvāmī described: 
Smoke is superior to wood, which is an earthly object; superior to smoke is fire, which is used for the sacrifices prescribed in the three Vedas. Similarly, rajas is superior to tamas, and superior to rajas is sattva, with the help of which one can realize the Absolute. (SB 1.2.24)30

tamasas tu rajas tasmat sattvaṁ yad brahma-darśanam 
1016 
99 Lakṣmi Is the Energy of the Lord 
baThe internal potencies are similarly arranged in a hierarchy - sandhini (the potency of being) is subsumed under samvit (the potency of knowing). Both of these in turn are subsumed under hladini (the potency that bestows bliss). The following example may help to illustrate how this is so. In conventional life, a person may buy a car and derive some satisfaction simply from owning it (being). One's satisfaction increases, however, when he learns to use the car (knowing), and still greater joy will result when he goes for a ride in the country (bliss). From this we can understand that the pleasure one derives from devotion (predominated by the potency of bliss) is enormously superior to that derived from impersonal realization of Brahman (predominated by the potency of being). In fact, there can be no comparison. The implication here is that the potency of know- ing is inclusive of being and thus involves further completion. The potency of bliss, however, is inclusive of both being and knowing and hence offers the highest completion 
The potency, by which Bhagavan manifests His śrī-vigraha, or divine form, is referred to by three names: vasudeva, which is also the name of Śrī Kṛṣṇa's father; viśuddha-sattva, which is transcen- dental to, and hence distinct from, material sattva; and murti, which is the term often used to refer to the Lord's body. 
Viśuddha-sattva is completely free from the gunas of material nature and is thus qualified by the word viśuddha, or completely pure. Impersonalists contend that viśuddha-sattva refers to material sattva-guna, or sattva without any contamination of rajas or tamas. But this is not possible, because the gunas are always intermixed. Moreover, the gunas are inert and have no ability to manifest the form of the Lord. 
The Lord appeared as Nara-Nārāyaṇa from Murti, the wife of Dharma. Dharma had twelve other wives, who were sisters of Murti: 
The thirteen daughters of Dakṣa who were given to Dharma are Śrad- dhā, Maitri, Dayā, Śanti, Tusti, Puṣṭī, Kriya, Unnati, Buddhi, Medha, Titikṣā, Hri and Murti. (SB 4.1.49-50)31" (s83,sus)

Śri Bhagavat Sandarbha 
These names are meaningful and hint at the energetic and psycho-spiritual forces required to facilitate the Lord's appearance. The Lord's mother is called Murti, because she brings forth His form, who is the abode of all auspicious qualities. 
sitry Total 
All these energies have two manifestations. They exist as form- less energies within the Lord, who in His feature as Energetic Source is called Bhagavan. As formless energies, they appear as insignia on the Lord's person, as in the case of Lakṣmi appearing as a golden curled streak on His chest. They also exist outside Him, and have their personal forms as His female associates. These forms are wor- shipable along with the Lord, as His consorts. Just as in Vedic culture, a wife serves her husband, similarly the personified energies work under the direction of the Lord. 
In the following anuccheda it is explained that Lakṣmi is the per- sonification of the Lord's svarupa-sakti, and She is never separated from Him.

Śrīdhara Svāmi has also explained these verses: "Time, which is divided into kalā kāsthā, nimesa and so on, is like the cos- mic thread (sutra) that governs the functions of the cosmos, but the Lord's potency, Laksmi, does not fall under its domain. This means that because She is nondifferent from the svarupa of the Lord, She never comes under the control of time. Therefore, being nondifferent from His [pure] svarupa, She is said to be the potency ‘of the pure' (suddhasya). adha

"Objection: 'But if Lakṣmi is nondifferent from the svarupa of the Lord, why is He referred to as the husband of Lakṣmi?' This is answered in the second verse, beginning with the word procyate. The word parama is a compound made up of para (transcenden- tal), and mā (the Goddess of Fortune), and it refers to Laksmi. Her controller (īśa) is Śrī Visnu ( parameśa). Although He is pure (sud- dha), meaning one without a second, He is figuratively called the husband of Lakṣmi in order to convey distinction. The second pronoun, yat (that which), is used to indicate that this is a well- known fact.” Here ends Sridhara Svāmī's commentosadi

IN THE PREVIOUS SECTION, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī explained the inter- nal energy of Bhagavan and its various manifestations. The person- ification of His internal energy, or svarupa-sakti, is called Lakṣmi Devi. She always appears to the left side of the Lord, and is also rep- resented by a streak of golden hair, called Śrīvatsa, on that side of His chest. Because the Lord's body is complete in itself, all the ener- gies that manifest externally also inhere in it. Just as one embraces one's beloved to one's chest, so Lakṣmi has Her place on the chest of the Lord, above His heart.

TRO Śrī Bhagavat Sandarbha 000 
She accompanies the Lord whenever He appears in the material world. Thus, She is called anapayini (inseparable). According to the mood and pastime of Śrī Viṣņu, Lakṣmi takes a corresponding mood. 
Laksmi is different from Māyā, the external energy, who is too shy to appear before Him and so serves the Lord at a distance. The flower garland (vana-mala) on His body is a representation of Māyā, since it is external to the Lord's body and thus indicates her external 
nature. 
An objection may here be raised: If Laksmi is the svarupa-sakti of Bhagavan and thus nondifferent from Him, how is it that the Lord is called Lakṣmi-pati, or the husband of Lakṣmi? The husband is dif- ferent from the wife. One cannot be the husband of one's own self. Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi says that there is no actual difference. It is only figurative. Energy is subservient to the Energetic Source, just as a chaste wife is surrendered to the husband in Vedic culture. It is in this sense that the Lord is called the husband. 
As explained in the last anuccheda, Bhagavan's energies also have personal forms, even though they are nondifferent from Him. We have energy, but it cannot exist as a person outside of ourselves. But the Lord can do that because He is omnipotent. The word suddha lit- erally means pure, or in other words, that which is unmixed with anything else. Here it means that the Lord is fully independent and there is nothing that exists besides Him. Therefore, when it is said that He is the husband of Lakṣmi, it is through the assumption of a difference, when in reality there is none. This is the philosophy of acintya-bheda-abheda. 
A further objection is raised: In the Seventh Canto, it is described how Hiranyakasipu tortured his saintly son, Prahlada. The Lord, appearing in an enraged and ferocious form as Nrsimha Deva, slayed Hiranyakasipu. Afterwards the gods were afraid to come before the Lord, so they requested Laksmi Devi to pacify Him. The verse (SB 7.9.2) cited in this anuccheda explains that Laksmi had never seen this form of the Lord before. If such is the case, how can it be said that Laksmi is the eternal consort of the Lord? 
In response, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi says that adṛṣṭāśruta-pūrva (never before seen or heard) means that when Lakṣmi Devi saw 
1024 
100 Lakṣmi Is the Lord's Eternal Consort 
the Lord in this most ferocious mood, She was nonplussed. In that perplexed state She thought that this was not Her Lord. Śrīla Viś- vanatha Cakravarti Thakura says that this was arranged by the lilä- sakti of the Lord so that Lakṣmi could taste adbhuta-rasa, or the aesthetic experience of the extraordinary. This means that Bhaga- vān's līlā-śakti made Lakṣmi Devi feel as if She had never heard of or seen such a person and was thus awestruck. 
In the next anuccheda, Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī goes on to explain that contradictory characteristics are harmoniously sheltered in Bhaga- van's body. For this reason, He can be understood only through the canons of the Vedic literature.

IN THIS WAY, through words that convey the experience of real- ized scholars, it has been clearly stated that Bhagavan has an eternal, conscious and blissful form. He is endowed with incon- ceivable, wonderful and unlimited energies that are intrinsic to His nature. Although He is these attributes, He is also in posses- sion of them; while having no divisions, He has various divisions; though He has no form, He has form; while all-pervading, He is of medium size. He is an ocean of such real, unlimited, mutu- ally opposing attributes. His divine form is distinct from gross and subtle objects, self-luminous, indivisible, and is integral to His essential nature. He has one primary divine form, called Bha- gavan, having the above characteristics, but manifests unlimited such forms. His left side is adorned by Laksmi, the manifestation of His personal potency, in a form corresponding to His. He exists 
1026 
101 Bhagavan Can Be Known Only through the Vedas 
in His various abodes with a form, dress, ornaments and asso- ciates, all of which are particular aspects of His own effulgence. He astonishes even the ātmārama sages with His extraordinary attributes, pastimes, and so on, all of which are manifestations of His svarupa-sakti. Brahman is His generic manifestation with- out attributes. He is the sole support and life of the intermediary potency called the jiva, and manifests unlimited universes by His external energy.

Those who have not awakened discrimination, and who are unable to recognize the nature of the Lord, which is distinct from matter, cannot entertain the possibility of the Lord's existence. This is appropriate [for them]. But to instill faith in those who wish to know, this explanation about the Lord has been tendered. In a single verse, the Śrutis explain that the Lord is imperceptible to the non-discriminating, but can be known exclusively through Vedic knowledge:

Alas, how can the people in this world, who take birth and die after the creation, know You, the creator, who existed prior to everything and from whom appeared the seer [Brahmā], fol- lowed by both classes of gods [the controlling deities of both the microcosm (the living being) and the macrocosm (the cosmos)]? When You withdraw the scripture into Yourself and go to sleep, then nothing else remains, whether gross or subtle, or any com- bination of these two, nor is there any flux of time. (SB 10.87.24)1

Bata [is an expression of surprise], “O my Lord!” How can a per- son in this world, who has taken birth and will die in these present times, know You, who existed prior to everything, i.e., who was established before all this? Explaining the reason behind the Lord's being primeval and the recentness of others, the Śrutis point to the lack of any means for acquiring knowl- edge [about Him] by saying, “ from whom appeared the seer, fol- lowed by both classes of gods." From You alone, the seer (rși), i.e., Brahma, was born. And both the adhyatmika and adhidaivika gods come after Brahmā; ādhyātmika here should be understood as the gods who preside over the microcosm, or all the functions related to individual embodiment. Therefore, all created beings are of recent appearance. riguo

When You withdraw the scriptures ( śāstra), namely the Vedas, which disclose You, retracting them into Vaikuntha, and go to sleep, i.e., when You withdraw Your vision from the material cre- ation, at that time the living beings, who sleep in response to Your cosmic sleep, have no means to acquire knowledge. This is so because at that time the gross elements, like the sky (sat), the subtle elements, like mahat (asat), the body, which is a product of both sat and asat, and their cause, the variety created by the flux of time (kāla-java), do not exist. This being so, at that time there are surely no senses, life-force and so on.

This is to be understood as follows: During the period of cre- ation the living beings do not have the capacity to ascertain the knowledge of Bhagavan promulgated by the Vedas for three prin- cipal reasons: first, because their attention is drawn towards the inferior material creation; secondly, because of the obstruction created by the limiting adjuncts, such as the body; and thirdly, because of impurities of the heart, arising from the influence of time and karma. On the other hand, although there are not many obstructions between You and the jivas at the time of total disso- lution, they do not have the ability to experience knowledge of Bhagavan even then, because of the absence of any means to do so, since the Vedas are unmanifest at that time and the living beings are absorbed in the deep sleep of great ignorance.

The One does not move, yet is more rapid than the mind. Previ- ously, the gods were unable to understand Him, for He had gone or before them. Though standing still, He surpasses all those who run. Vayu offers the actions of living beings to Him. (ISA 4)5 id

Commentary 
36 gbstwohesus send villide 901 vend pun ob vådt moltul IN THIS AND THE NEXT SECTION, Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmi concludes Bha- gavat Sandarbha. There are specific processes to acquire different types of knowledge. Bhagavan, or the Absolute Reality, can be understood only through the medium of the revealed scriptures. This is because He is beyond the scope of material sense perception (adhokṣaja). The senses are made of matter, and thus they can per- ceive only matter. The other means of acquiring knowledge, such as inference, are based on direct perception and thus also have the same limitation. 
9111 
Moreover, Bhagavan is pratyag-ätmä, or self-illuminating like the sun. The sun is seen by the power of its own light as well as by the eye, which is presided over by the sun-god. This means that human beings cannot independently see the sun. The sun reveals itself by its own magnificence. If one desires to see the sun at night, he will be baffled. Although the sun is the source of light in the universe, it is also the cause of darkness. This offers us a glimpse of how the Lord can accommodate contradictory characteristics. This is why He can be understood only through the Vedas, which are His words. He can- not be understood by any amount of logic or empirical research. For more details on this subject, readers are advised to refer to Tattva Sandarbha, Anucchedas 9-11.

The Lord is the source of everything, thus it is not possible for anyone to know Him. The Lord Himself told Arjuna: 
Neither the gods nor the sages know My origin, for, in every respect, I am the source of the gods and sages. (GĪTĀ 10.2)" 
If a child wants to know about the childhood activities of his father, he cannot use the process of direct perception. Past and future events cannot be perceived directly. Similarly, no one can know the source of the Lord, who is the origin of everyone. More- over, He has no source, so how could anyone know it? The Lord's actions, although eternally existent, cannot be understood by a com- mon person because they are beyond the approach of the material senses. As we have already seen above, this was the subject dealt 
ove, this with by the Śrutis in their prayers. 
Although the Vedic knowledge is available during the period of creation, the living beings are not in a pure state. They are cov- ered by the subtle and gross bodies, which create a distance between them and the Lord and disqualify them from knowing Him. More- over, the Lord creates, and after creating disappears; therefore, the jīvas cannot see Him. 
If someone suggests that the jivas should be able to see the Lord during the period of dissolution, because at that time they are not obstructed by the subtle and gross bodies, the Śrutis reply that at that time they do not have the means to acquire knowledge, namely, the senses and the Vedas. But this does not mean that no one can access knowledge of the Lord. One is imbued with knowledge of the Lord through pure devotion. This will be described in the last anuccheda.

१०२ । अथ तत्पूर्वकं विदुषां भक्त्यैव साक्षादनुभवनीयत्वमाह त्रिभिः (भा० ९।८।२२) – 
AMSUMAN STATES IN THREE VERSES that those of highly refined discrimination, having become acquainted with theoretical knowledge of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, experience Him directly exclusively through the cultivation of devotion: 
ITAD 
bo 
न पश्यति त्वां परमात्मनोऽजनो न बुध्यतेऽद्यापि समाधियुक्तिभिः । तोऽपरे तस्य मनःशरीरधीविसर्गसृष्टा वयमप्रकाशाः ।। ५०६ ।। 
Even to this day, the unborn [Brahma] is unable to see or under-do stand you, who are beyond the self, either through samadhi or reasoning. How then could other living beings, who have evolved from his mind, body and intellect, do so, or even we, who have no illumination? (SB 9.8.22) 
अजनोऽजो ब्रह्मापि त्वामद्यापि न पश्यति न च बुध्यते । कथम्भूतम् ? आत्मनः परं प्रत्य- ग्रूपम् । कैर्हेतुभिरपि न बुध्यते न पश्यति च ? समाधियुक्तिभिः ब्रह्मसमाधिनाप्यपरोक्षं न पश्यति । युक्तिभिः परोक्षमपि न सम्यग् बुध्यत इत्यर्थः । अपरेऽर्वाचीनास्तु कुतस्त्वां पश्येयुर्बुध्येरन् वा । अर्वाचीनत्वे हेतुः – तस्य ब्रह्मणः । मनश्च शरीरं च धीश्च ताभिः सत्त्व- तमोरजःकार्यभूताभिर्विविधा ये देवतिर्यङ्नराणां सर्गास्तेषु सृष्टाः । तत्रापि वयमप्रकाशा अज्ञाः कुतः पश्येम इत्यर्थः । 
The unborn (ajana) Brahmā neither sees nor comprehends You even to this day. So then, what kind of being are You? You are the 
1032 
102 Bhagavan Can Be Realized through Devotion Alone 
one who is beyond the [individual] self, namely the indwelling Paramātmā. And Brahma is unable to know You or see You even by which means? Even by trance (samadhi) or by logic (yukti). This means that He is unable to see You directly, even by absorp- tion in trance on Brahman, nor is he able to understand You completely, even just indirectly, through reasoning. Then how can those of recent appearance see or know You? The reason for their being of recent appearance is that they are created by Brahma's mind, body and intelligence, which are products of the gunas of translucence, dynamism and inertia, and appear in var- ious species, such as gods, subhumans and humans. Moreover, how can we, who have no illumination, i.e., who are devoid of knowledge, see You? This is the import of the verse. 
Commentary 
ALTHOUGH BHAGAVAN is described in Vedic literature, only a devo- tee can understand Him. Devotion is the key to realization of the Vedic knowledge. Any attempt to understand the Lord without pure devotion is like licking the outside of a honey jar. 
In this anuccheda, Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī cites three verses from the prayers Amśuman offered to Śrī Kapila. Amśuman was a grandson of King Sagara, who once performed a horse sacrifice. Indra stole the horse and tethered it in Śrī Kapila's asrama. When the sons of Sagara found the horse, they took Kapila to be a thief posing as a yogi and insulted Him as he sat in meditation. When Kapiladeva opened His eyes, the princes were burnt to ashes. Later on, Amśuman traced out his lost uncles and came to understand the true glory of Śrī Kapila. He offered prayers to appease the Lord, in which he mentions that even Śrī Brahma, the first being in the universe, cannot see Him, what to speak of those who have come after Brahmājī. 
An evolutionist may claim that people evolved and developed better senses, but their theory is not supported by the Vedas. Śrī Brahma is the creator, and if he does not have the ability to see the Lord, then how can those he created have such ability?

They are unable to see You, situated in their hearts, because they see only the external world. (SB 9.8.23)1

lwend Although You are fully situated within them, the embodied beings do not know You. They see only the gunas, or in other words, the external objects made of the gunas, and sometimes they see nothing other than darkness. This means that when operating predominantly under the influence of the intelligence (buddhi), which is formed of the three gunas, they can see only the objects of the waking and dream states, because they are depen- dent on this buddhi. In deep sleep, however, [when buddhi is non-operational] they see only ignorance [and not the products of the gunas]. [This absence of buddhi in deep sleep, however, does not mean that what is perceived is the nirguna state]. In truth, they do not see You, who are the Self of all selves and free from the three gunas. The reason for all of this is that their consciousness is bewildered by Your māyā.

102 Bhagavan Can Be Realized through Devotion Alone 
Commentary 
In the previous verse it was said that even Brahma is unable to see or understand Bhagavän. Now the question is, can anyone else see Him then? Here too the answer is no. The senses are products of the mate- rial elements. Of all the elements, the mahat-tattva, which is con- sidered the cosmic intelligence, is supreme. According to Śrī Kṛṣṇa (SB 11.13.27), the states of wakefulness, dreaming and deep sleep are manifested by the intelligence (buddhi) under the influence of sat- tva, rajas and tamas. Intelligence, however, perceives objects only in the waking and dreaming states. It cannot perceive anything dur- ing deep sleep (suşupti). Then how can it perceive Bhagavan, who is beyond the turīya state, or the fourth dimension of consciousness, known as Brahman?

You are condensed awareness (jñāna-ghana), which is to say that Your form is the personification of eternality, consciousness and unlimited bliss. Therefore, in the Sahasra-nama-stotra You are called anirdesya- vapu, or one whose body cannot be defined. The sense is this: Because Your form is constituted entirely of consciousness, You cannot be the object of consciousness, and even if You could be understood through deliberation, I am unable to think of You because I am overpowered by the guņas of māyā.

Śrī Brahmā designed the senses in such a way that they perceive only outwardly - they cannot perceive the individual self or the Supreme Self within, even during the waking and dreaming states. The Supreme Self can, however, be perceived by the grace of bhakti, which is the Lord's internal potency. Śrī Kṛṣṇa asserts this: "Only through pure devotion coupled with faith can I be understood and realized" (SB 11.14.21). Just as one can smell only through the nose and hear only through the ear, one can see the Lord only through bhakti. The devotees who have shattered their illusion by the grace of the Lord can see the Lord within and without - premañjana-cchurita bhakti vilocanena santaḥ sadaiva hṛdayeşu vilokayanti.

102 Bhagavan Can Be Realized through Devotion Alone 
Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi compares the atheist to an owl. An owl abhors the sun and does not open its eyes during the day. Though the owl may deny the sun's existence, human beings would have no regard for its point of view. Similarly, atheists keep their eyes turned away from the Lord and foolishly declare that there is no God, or that God is dead. However loudly such people may rail against God's exis- tence, the devotees, who relish rendering service to the Lord, pay no attention to their foolish entreaties. 
Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmi concludes by citing a verse from Katha Upanisad, which declares that only those who are blessed by the Lord can understand Him. This is also his hidden blessing for the faithful reader. Here the reader receives the Lord's (or the author's) bless- ings, so he or she can understand the analysis of Absolute Reality presented in Bhagavat Sandarbha and thus cross the ocean of mis- eries. Śrī Brahma spoke a similar verse while instructing Narada about the Lord's various avataras: 
Only those to whom the Infinite Lord has bestowed His grace, who have taken refuge in His feet with their whole being, without any vested interest, are able to cross His māyā, which is very difficult to transcend, and not those who identify themselves with the body, which is food for dogs and jackals, or who think of it as their own. (SB 2.7.42)" 
Therefore, to realize the Absolute and make one's human life suc- cessful, one should take to devotional service. A detailed analysis of devotional service will be presented in the fifth volume of the Sandarbhas- Bhakti Sandarbha.

The Language of Transcendence - Key Terms and Concepts 
by Navadvip Das (Bruce Martin) 
IN THE WORK OF TRANSLATING THE SANDARBHAS, careful atten- tion has been given to the language used to convey specific terms and concepts. The emphasis has been on maintaining consistency with the overall theme of the work and, in particular, with the spe- cific vision developed by Śrī Jiva Gosvāmi. The Ṣat Sandarbha, also known as Bhāgavata Sandarbha, is no ordinary exposition of theism, for it defines Bhagavan in terms of nondual consciousness (advaya- jñāna). By so doing, it opens the field of investigation of nondual real- ity to new insights, and so creates a basis for interface with other wisdom schools, as well as with the fields of transpersonal psychol- ogy, transcendental phenomenology, and the leading edge of quan- tum physics, cosmology and consciousness studies. Jīva Gosvāmi's treatise certainly took into account the most important philosoph- ical views of his day, and there is much in his writing that can be of great value to modern fields of knowledge as well. So the lan- guage used in translating his work has been chosen to facilitate such correspondence. Beimin

In this regard, three terms in particular require special attention so that their sense may be correctly understood by the reader: "nondual devotion" as a translation (in select passages) for uttama-bhakti, the "Nondual Personal Absolute" and the "Complete Whole" as translations for

Bhagavan, and "Radical Nondualism" for the Absolute Idealism of Sankara's Advaita Vedānta. 
In going through this vital introduction to the language of the Sandarbhas, we hope you will discover that this is not merely a glos- sary of terms, but an interconnected framework of revelatory con- cepts. With this in mind, the selection begins with acintya, the trans-rational, because it contains a discussion of sabdyate, how the Absolute is describable in words. 
ACINTYA (TRANS-RATIONAL) This term refers to that which is beyond conventional logic or reason, yet not altogether inexpress- ible through language and thought. The Nondual Absolute is not alto- gether inconceivable because it can be conceived, but only through trans-rational logic. Śrīdhara Svāmī as well as Jiva Gosvāmī define it is tarka-asaham - beyond the range of conventional or linear logic. Just as there exist higher order laws operating within the quantum domain that don't conform to mechanistic science, so also there are higher order dynamics existing within the transpersonal domain that surpass conventional logic. It is these trans-rational dynam- ics that make possible transcendent variety and distinction within the nondual whole while still preserving perfectly intact its nondual nature. So although acintya literally means beyond thought or incon- ceivable, it actually points to the realm of trans-conventional being, which is nonetheless describable in words. 
The transpersonal reality is, of course, beyond mind and thought and is incapable of being grasped merely by mental striving; yet being of the nature of self-luminosity, or self-revelation, it can nonetheless disclose itself even through thought and language. So acintya, rendered as inconceivable, does not imply incapability of being expressed in words. Bearing this in mind, acintya should not be equated with Sankara's notion of anirvacaniya, or inexpressibil- ity through words. If Brahman is no more than unqualified being, devoid of characteristics or potencies, then nothing more can be said about it, because any description would ultimately be an imposition of a thought construct upon inscrutable reality. 
[nIf, however, as the Bhagavata maintains, the Absolute is replete with unlimited potency, then unlimited words, which are themselves 
1046 
The Language of Transcendence - Key Terms and Concepts 
potencies emanating from that source, can appropriately describe that Reality. This is exactly the point that Jiva Gosvāmī makes in Bha- gavat Sandarbha (Anuccheda 87). The Vedas are transhuman words emanating from the divine source that accurately depict its true inherent nature, because the Vedas are infused with the self-revela- tory power of the intrinsic potency. Jiva goes a step further by saying that even human speech that is similarly infused with the intrinsic potency and thus in correspondence with the divine source can also describe the Absolute. This is the final purpose for which the intel- lect, mind and senses were created in the first place. In the words of the Bhagavata (10.87.2), these material instruments were created "ultimately to transcend the act of filtering experience through the screen of prior assumptions (akalpanaya), or in other words, for liberation." So in answer to the question, "how can thought and lan- guage describe the Absolute?" it can simply be said, "because they were created specifically to do so." 
MASAS 
Hence, the word sabdyate, "describable in words," is used in ref- erence to the Nondual Absolute, mentioned in the Bhāgavata's sem- inal verse (1.2.11). It is for this reason that the knowers of truth (tattva-vit) refer to it as Brahman, Paramātmā and Bhagavan. It is in this light too that Śrī Jiva defines acintya as śāstraika-gamyatvam- that which is knowable only through the revealed word of God or of realized devotees. He did not conclude it to be ineffable. quivil STE BRAHMAN (THE UNQUALIFIED ABSOLUTE) This refers to the Nondual Absolute (advaya-jñāna), devoid of all distinctions, such as names, forms, qualities and action, and hence devoid of inher- ent potency (svarupa-śakti). Such distinctions (bheda) are perceived through conventional logic to be limiting adjuncts (upadhis) that would confine the Absolute, leading to the inevitable dualism of subject and object (i.e., the name is different from the named and potency different from 'the potent'). Thus Brahman is sometimes conceived as that which remains upon negation of the sum total of the phenomenal. 
Such conventional logic, of course, presupposes all distinction as 'phenomenal distinction.' It cannot at all account even for the possibility of trans-phenomenal distinction (acintya bheda) because 
1047 
eneral Lines References 
that is necessarily beyond the predetermined range of its own inves- tigative validity. It cannot make any claims whatsoever in regard to possibilities lying beyond this limit. So, in effect, all that can be definitely concluded by this method is that for the Absolute to be nondual, it cannot have material names, material forms and so on. If there are such things as trans-phenomenal names, forms, qual- ities, action and personhood that are inherently nondual, or that exist as inherent potencies of the Nondual Absolute, an altogether different method and logic, trans-rational in nature, is required to apprehend them. Hence, to be precise Brahman is not so much the Absolute devoid of all distinction as the indistinct vision of the Abso- lute. In other words, it is the indistinct view of Reality as disclosed by the path of jñāna. It is not the distinct view of Reality inclusive of a trans-phenomenal interiority, as disclosed by the path of nondual devotion (see uttama bhakti and svarupa-sakti below). 
PARAMĀTMĀ (THE SUPREME INDWELLING SELF OR, SIMPLY, THE SUPREME SELF) This refers to the immanent feature of the Absolute, pervading the cosmos and the individual living beings as the Supreme witness, internal guide and regulator. Paramātmā is the Supreme Self of all individual selves (ātmā), and so He may also be referred to as the Supreme Immanent or the Supreme Immanent Self. Though Paramātmā remains uninvolved with prakṛti and the living beings as impartial witness, He is, nonetheless, their origi- nator and the facilitator of their operations. As such He is Ïśvara, the Supreme Controller, Master, Source and Foundation. Yet Param- ātmā should not be equated with 'the Creator God' because primor- dial nature and the living beings are His eternal potencies. Hence, Paramātmā is the Nondual Absolute in His feature of immanence. 
In contrast with Brahman, Paramātmā is replete with trans- phenomenal distinction, including name, form, qualities, action and personhood, all of which are inherent in Him. While yet non- different from Bhagavan, He is but a portion of a portion of the original Complete Person (Svayam Bhagavan). So while He Himself in His own self-effulgent nature is fully transcendent, His sphere of influence is tied to the perpetual play of creation, known as sṛṣṭi- lilă. Thus He does not manifest the full extension of transcendental

variegatedness as in the case of Bhagavan. So Paramātmā is Bhaga- van with the limited role of sheltering the modifications of prakṛti and the jivas who are involved with her. Uses hab se sables 
ида 
BHAGAVAN (THE NONDUAL PERSONAL ABSOLUTE) Etymolog- ically, the word bhagavan is composed of bhaga + vat, endowed with or encompassing all opulence (bhaga). That which encompasses everything is the Complete Whole, implying that it includes and yet transcends everything. Bhagavan may also be rendered as the Complete Person (Pūrṇa Puruṣa) when emphasizing that the Com- plete Whole is inherently personal in nature. The former term may be more appropriate, or universally applicable, when stressing sim- ply Bhagavan's general characteristic of all-inclusivity. In the most generic sense Bhagavan may be referred to simply as the Supreme Person or the Supreme Being. 
When speaking of the Absolute as nondual awareness (advaya- jñāna) and Bhagavan as the complete distinct vision of nondual 
awareness, it may be appropriate to refer to Bhagavan as the Non- dual Personal Absolute in keeping with the context. In contrast with Brahman, Bhagavan is the distinct vision of the Nondual Absolute, inherently self-endowed with intrinsic potency (svarupa-śakti), and hence eternally replete with transcendental name, form, qualities, action and personhood. As discussed above, though all of these dis- tinct characteristics inhere in Him, He is yet one and nondual in nature, which is made possible through His unprecedented trans- rational power (acintya-sakti). So the metaphysical system that depicts this state of being is known as acintya-bheda-abheda. In con- trast with Paramātmā, who is but a portion of the Complete Whole, Bhagavan's variegatedness is entirely beyond the realm of creation, being exclusively the play of divinity, known as divya-lilā. Hence, Bhagavan may be understood as the Nondual Absolute in His feature of supreme transcendence.sbtopi kiadto 
The Nondual Personal Absolute, Bhagavan, is not just the Com- plete Whole, but an integrated whole. He is not whole because of being devoid of distinct parts that might otherwise contradict His undifferentiated unity. Rather, He is inherently inclusive of varieties of distinct energies as their supreme source and refuge. 
1049

These energies have no existence apart from Bhagavan and thus in this sense are nondifferent from Him. Yet, while these energies exist as distinct aspects of His inherent nature, He is more than the sum total of them. He thus includes and yet transcends them. He is therefore an integrated whole having individual parts that are distinct from, and yet one with, Him. There is nothing which exists independent of Bhagavan.mlow stafquot 
THE JIVA (THE INDIVIDUAL LIVING BEING) This refers to the conscious self (ātmā) as qualified by the intellect (buddhi), ego (ahankara), the mind (manas), the senses and the physical body. In this sense the jiva is known as the embodied self or the empirical self. Yet, the jiva's individual selfhood (i.e., its supra-empirical selfhood rooted in the very identity of the ātmā) is not a product of mere illu- sion that vanishes on the awakening of its identity with Brahman. Though the jiva is one in identity with Brahman, this does not signify absolute non-distinction as advocated by Sankara. The jiva is in fact a conscious part of Paramātmā. By this it is not meant that the jiva is a broken-off part but an integrated part of the Complete Whole. S70 The jiva eternally partakes of identity with Paramātmā and can never be ontologically separated from Paramātmā, even in the so- called state of bondage. The jiva, as conscious or integrated part (cid-amsa), is never truly bound. The jiva, however, is sometimes referred to as vibhinnāmsa, a separated part. This separation is purely psychological, owing to beginningless ignorance. Even in this state of psychological or self-imposed bondage, the jiva is no other than an integrated part of the integrated whole. This is due to the fact that the jiva is an eternal distinct potency of Paramātmā known as taṭastha-sakti, the intermediary potency. It is so-called because it belongs neither to the intrinsic spiritual potency (svarupa- śakti) nor to the extrinsic material potency (māyā-śakti), but can be influenced by both. So the jiva is eternally distinct from and yet one with Paramātmā, by virtue of the trans-rational potency (acintya- śakti) of the one Nondual Absolute. 
UTTAMA BHAKTI (PURE OR UNALLOYED DEVOTION) First of all, because the entire discussion of Bhagavata Sandarbha proceeds on the basis of the definition of Ultimate Reality as nondual

consciousness (advaya-jñāna), and because Bhagavan is shown to be nondual consciousness in its highest completion, it seems only appropriate to consider bhakti, which is the means of realizing the Nondual Personal Whole, Bhagavan, as being of the nature of nondu- ality. In light of this consideration, nondual devotion does not refer to devotion merely as a means of realizing the unqualified Nondual Absolute (i.e., Brahman). Such a notion would be more appropri- ately rendered as devotional nonduality, wherein nonduality is the subject and devotion merely a qualifier. Rather, nondual devotion is meant in the sense of the inherent potency of the complete Nondual Absolute, Bhagavan, which reveals Him as the unity that upholds all distinction. It is the devotion opened to when all separative and dualistic self-concepts operating under the influence of the gunas have been transcended. The purity of uttama bhakti signifies that it is altogether beyond the influence of the gunas of primordial nature, and thus it is also known as nirguna bhakti (see the discussion that follows below). 
DEVOTION MIXED WITH THE GUNAS (DUALISTIC DEVOTION) Correspondingly, if nondual devotion is the means that discloses the Nondual Absolute as Bhagavan, then devotion mixed with the gunas must necessarily be dualistic in nature. This is exactly what Kapiladeva states in the Bhagavata (3.29.8-10). He uses the terms bhinna-drg-bhava (of separatist vision) and pṛthak-bhava (a sepa- ratist) to describe the performers of devotion mixed with any one of the three gunas. In Bhakti Sandarbha, after the description of äropa-siddha bhakti (attributive devotion) and sanga-siddha bhakti (associative devotion), there follows the explanation of uttama bhakti (i.e., svarupa-siddha bhakti). But the delineation of uttama bhakti proper is preceded by a discussion of bhakti in the gunas, which is marked by these three types of separatist or dualistic visions. The key point is that the performer is still rooted in dual- ism, considering him or herself separate from Bhagavan. Sadhana is thus performed with this dualistic mentality, as a means only to an end and therefore causal in nature, rather than as an end unto itself, acausal in nature, as immediate and present connection with Bhagavan, here and now. daduchovel, among

NIRGUNA BHAKTI (DEVOTION FREE FROM THE GUNAS) BY By contrast with mixed devotion, devotion free from the gunas is com- pared (SB 3.29.11) to the natural, continuous, unobstructed flow of the Ganga to the sea, because the Ganga, while distinct from the ocean, is nonetheless in no way disconnected from the ocean, which is its final refuge. Jiva Gosvāmi states in Tattva Sandarbha that the oneness of the jiva and Brahman is in terms of identity of being, yet he clarifies that this oneness in no way implies absolute non- distinction. It could also be stated the other way, that the distinc- tion between the jiva and Paramātmā in no way implies absolute or categorical separation. In fact, as an integrated part of the Complete Whole, the jiva can never be separated from Paramātmā, even in the state of bondage. The sense of separation is merely psychological, having no ontological reality whatsoever. Hence, devotion in which the performer holds to the egoistic position of being a doer or subject separate from the ultimate 'object' (Bhagavan) is most appropriately referred to as dualistic devotion. 
By placing this discussion as a preface to uttama bhakti, Jīva Gosvāmi clearly recognizes this mentality as a significant and promi- nent pitfall among those who presume themselves to be on the path of pure devotion. So the terms nondual devotion and dualistic devo- tion are helpful in clarifying this most important distinction. And what does this distinction imply in practical terms for the practi- tioner? It is not we who perform devotion, rather it is devotion that performs us. That is to say that devotion enacts itself through its own power of self-revelation, and in so doing it reveals the living being in its true identity, lending its inherent nature of awareness and bliss to the instrument of its manifestation. 
Beginning from the sense organs, the tongue, ears, eyes, hands, and so on, it works its ways inward, pervading the internal organs, the vital system, the emotions and the mental quantum of mind, ego, and intellect, till it reaches at last to the ātmā, making the ātmā one with its essential nature. In what sense then can the practi- tioner truly be said to be a practitioner or a performer of devotion? One who holds to the egoistic and separatist conception of being a performer of devotion, a chanter of the name, a doer of acts of 
1052 
The Language of Transcendence - Key Terms and Concepts 
good to others and God and so on, is caught in dualistic devotion, impeding this transcendental flow. When we abandon this sepa- ratist identity, we become but instruments through which devotion itself flows unimpeded, the interactive screen upon which the divine name arises, the playground in which the drama of worship unfolds. 
Karma (DualistiC ACTION) In the same light, karma, even in its nişkāma form in which the desire for the fruit of action is relin- quished, is necessarily dualistic because the performer holds to the notion of being separate from the object and the result of action. It is for this reason that Jiva Gosvāmī as well as Sanatana Gosvāmī dis- agree with Śrīdhara Svami in not accepting karma offered to Bhaga- vän as bhakti. Even when the desire for fruit is given up, the sense of doership remains. So, when the discussion again carries refer- ence to the Absolute as nondual awareness, karma is appropriately referred to as dualistic action. In a more general context, it may be rendered as goal-oriented or result-oriented action. This is just another way of saying the same thing because all dualistic action is carried out by a performer seeking some particular result that is sep- arated both from the performer and the act itself in time and place and is therefore causal in nature. rod dosadach 
O SANKARA'S ADVAITA VEDANTA (RADICAL NONDUALISM) This is but one school of Vedanta and hence but one school of nondual- ism. From the Bhāgavata (1.2.11) and from Jiva Gosvāmi's analysis throughout the Sat Sandarbha, it is clear that there is also theistic or devotional nondualism. In fact, Jiva Gosvāmi's entire vision devel- ops from his understanding of the Absolute as nondual awareness, and from his recognition of nonduality as the common ground and the lowest common denominator from which a discussion of the Absolute can proceed. Thus the Bhagavata's vision of nonduality, which Jiva seeks to bring forth, is a unique one, far exceeding the generic oneness of Sankara. 
soression 
TheSo it is essential to speak of different schools of nonduality with different emphasis. It is in this light that we refer to Sankara's view as Radical Nondualism, from the Latin radix, or connected to the root, implying that his view denies all distinction to the very core. It is absolute in its denial of distinction. 
1053no big sms References 
no Sankara's doctrine claims to represent the quintessence of the Upanisads. Yet in the Upanisads we find two types of statements, i.e., those that accommodate trans-phenomenal variety within unity and those that emphasize oneness and non-distinction. Examples of the first type are svabhäviki jñāna bala kriya ca, "The Supreme Per- son has multifarious potencies that are intrinsic to His being, includ- ing knowledge, will power and action" (Svetäśvatara Upanisad 6.8), and, nityo nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānām eko, "There is one supreme eternal amongst all the eternal living beings and one supreme con- scious source amongst the multitude of conscious entities" (Katha Upanisad 2.2.13). Examples of the second type are sarvam khalv idam brahma, "All this is indeed Brahman" (Chandogya Upanisad 3.14.1), and, neha nānā 'sti kiñcana, "There is no diversity here whatsoever" (Katha Upanisad 2.1.11). Sankara has given importance only to those statements that emphasize oneness alone and treated the statements advocating unity in variety as secondary, denying primary meaning to them without giving any satisfactory explanation or reason. qThe question may be asked, how can nondualism be put forth as the most valid description of reality when it is practically observed that there is a distinction between subject and object, between Spirit (Brahman) and the world (jagat or prakṛti), between con- scious beings (jivas) and insentient matter? Sankara's solution is to advocate nondualism (lit. not two) by denial of the object: brahma satyam jagan mithya (the world is unreal, only Brahman is real), so that in effect there is only Brahman, there is only the subject and no object, there is only one. So because Sankara's nondualism denies the object to the very root (radix), it may be referred to as Radi- cal Nondualism. That is to say that it can account for oneness only (abheda) and not for distinction. Distinction is admitted only in an empirical sense (as mithya) but without fundamental ontological existence. He can in no way accommodate trans-phenomenal dis- tinction (acintya-bheda) because he cannot accommodate inherent potency (svarupa-śakti) within the nondual whole. 
nd An alternate meaning of radical is "that which is a departure from tradition." Sankara's Vedanta or Nondualism is radical in this sense too because it is a departure from the traditional or 
1054 
The Language of Transcendence - Key Terms and Concepts 
mainstream Vedantic view that acknowledges the ontological real- ity of prakṛti, Iśvara and the living being. Sankara may have thought it necessary to reinterpret this view in order to legitimize and stress the nondual nature of the Absolute, but in doing so, he introduced a strategic error that ultimately undermined his own system, that of Brahman's becoming overwhelmed by māyā. It is for this rea- son that his doctrine is sometimes rightly referred to as Māyāvāda, because māyā, which is said by him to be devoid of ontological real- ity, is yet able to overcome Brahman, the one and only real. Because of this mutation of mainstream Vedantic thought, his system may appropriately be referred to as "Radical Nondualism." 
Again, Sankara's attempt to establish nonduality by denial of the object proves to be inadequate and unsatisfactory. His contribution is significant in what it attempts to accomplish, but it begs a more comprehensive and far-reaching understanding of nonduality. In a way, Sankara's view can be seen as a reaction to, and the counterpart of, the Buddhist doctrine of anatta (or anatma), which by contrast establishes nonduality by denial of the subject. Both of these views, though establishing nondualism from opposite starting points, stop short of a truly authentic trans-rational metaphysics, resorting to conventional logic to establish a limited and hence morphed nond- uality. Still both are useful in urging conventional devotion out of its tendency to get stuck in dualism. It is finally the acintya-bheda- abheda metaphysics of the Bhāgavata and Jiva Gosvāmi that com- pletes and surpasses the limited nondualistic views of Sankara and the Buddha. 
NONDUALITY OF THE BHAGAVATA (THEISTIC NONDUALISM) By comparison, the nonduality of the Bhagavata may be referred to as theistic nondualism, which finds its most complete expression in the visionary view known as acintya-bheda-abheda, the trans- rational inherence of distinction within the integral Nondual Whole. In this view, like that of Sankara, there is only one vastava vastu, or ontological existent that is nondual in nature, yet unlike Sankara, it is admitted that unlimited potency of different categories inheres in this one existent. Though the inherence of distinction apparently contradicts its nonduality from the point of view of conventional

reason or logic, from the trans-rational perspective (acintya), it is perfectly in keeping with the higher internal laws (or constituting nature) that govern the trans-phenomenal reality. To take it a step further, nondualism that can accommodate oneness only and not distinction remains impoverished and hence can hardly be admitted as the Complete Whole. vd bo

Therefore, theistic nondualism extends far beyond Sankara's view. Yet if Bhagavan is wrongly interpreted merely as the creator or regulator God, then this would seem to advocate dualism. This is a gross error that has allowed nondual devotion to be reduced to dual- istic worship. Theism in general is almost automatically equated with dualism and is thus conceived to be inferior by the schools of nondualism that advocate either Brahman or nirvana as ultimate. The highest state of the transpersonal is concluded through con- ventional logic to be non-personal. But this is exactly the point at which conventional logic breaks down. The logic that exhausts itself at the doorway of Brahman or nirvana becomes the barrier to the hidden interior of nondual awareness, an expanded nonduality that accommodates distinction in oneness.subcondidas dauo 
This is why it is imperative to begin the discussion of reality at the point of advaya-jñāna and to correspondingly understand Bhaga- vān as the Nondual Personal Absolute. In this way we eliminate the possibility of the misplaced reduction and force the investigation of reality to proceed beyond its general limit, that of unqualified, indis- tinct, monolithic Brahman. That is the real purpose of the Bhaga- vata and Jiva Gosvāmi's presentation of the Bhagavata Sandarbha - to lead the discussion into the interiority of nondual awareness. 
SVARUPA-SAKTI (THE INTERIORITY OF NONDUAL AWARENESS) This refers to the inherent potency with which the Nondual Abso- lute is eternally self-endowed. When the Nondual Absolute is con- ceived as unqualified and devoid of potency, it is known as Brah- man. When the same Nondual Absolute is conceived as inherently self-endowed with all potency, it is known as Bhagavan. The onto- logical entity is one and the same, yet a higher order, or, in other words, trans-rational, logic is required to understand how distinc- tion (bheda) can be possible without violating the basic nature of

nonduality (abheda). This is worked out in detail in the Bhāgavata and the Sat Sandarbha. In short, the inherent nature of the Nondual Absolute cannot be other than nondual. And it is the inherent nature or intrinsic potency of the Nondual Absolute that discloses its inte- riority, that discloses its variegated display of transcendent being, awareness and bliss. So it is the intrinsic potency (svarupa-śakti), particularly in the form of nondual devotion (uttama bhakti), that discloses the interiority of nondual awareness. 
EKAPĀDA & TRIPADA VIBHŪTI (ONEFOLD AND THREEFOLD DIMENSIONALITY OF BEING) These terms are commonly ren- dered as "the one-quarter manifestation of Reality" (i.e., the mate- rial realm) and "the three-quarter manifestation of Reality" (i.e., the spiritual realm). Strictly speaking, however, this has nothing to do with any sort of mathematical ratio between the material and spiritual domains. If the spiritual realm is infinite, should it not be infinitely more vast than the material world? (In fact, even the mate- rial realm is infinite, and conventional mathematics fails at the level of infinity, infinity being trans-rational.) Moreover, if the 3:1 ratio is merely symbolic to indicate the magnitude of Spirit in relation to matter, why then express it by such a paltry ratio as 3:1 instead of, say, a million to one? After all, we are speaking about infinity and 3:1 just doesn't seem to cut it. 
As Jiva Gosvāmī demonstrates in Bhagavat Sandarbha (Anu- ccheda 67), 3:1 refers to something quite specific. Tripäd vibhūti, which is another name for the spiritual realm, refers to three qual- ities or dimensions of transcendental being, namely immortal- ity (amṛtatva), fearlessness (abhaya), and auspiciousness (kṣema). These are three qualities woven into the fabric of transcendence. Ekapāda vibhuti, on the other hand, which is a name for the material world, refers to mortality alone. Thus, in the material world, 'being' culminates moment to moment in death alone. Fear and inauspi- ciousness, which are the material counterparts of the other two spir- itual characteristics, are subsumed within the simple inescapable fact of mortality. So it is clear from this analysis that we are speaking about dimensions or aspects of being and not about mathematical ratios. 
1057

Further, a parallel can be drawn between the three qualitative dimensions of transcendental being and the well-known descrip- tion of Spirit as sat-cit-ananda. Immortality can be equated with sat because it signifies eternal existence. Fearlessness can be equated with cit because it is a state of awareness, and auspiciousness can be equated with ananda because it is a state of beatitude and hence bliss. Jiva Gosvāmi goes on to explain that kṣema, or auspiciousness, specif- ically refers to all-auspicious devotion, which culminates in prema (i.e., ānanda).

Because this practice in general is not intended for the exclusive pleasure of God, it is excluded from the definition of bhakti. Moreover, it is rejected by pure devotees because the sense of oneself being God precludes the possibility of seva, which is the very essence of bhakti.

PRADHANA Primordial nature, also known as prakṛti. The term pradhana Amal (primary, original, predominant) suggests the primary nature of 
prakṛti as the first cause of the aggregate of all effects in the world. 
This refers to the state of equilibrium of the three gunas, prior to their adly being set in motion by the puruşa, from which the cosmos evolves bif(see also prakṛti). 
PRAJAPATIS The original progenitors of the world's population according 
to Puranic lore. These refer to the sons of Brahmã other than the Kumāras and Narada, who were celibate sages. 
PRAKRTI According to Sankhya philosophy, prakṛti is the uncaused cause 
of the whole world of effects, which are its modifications. It is the ulti- mate material cause into which the whole world is dissolved. It is infi- nite and all pervasive, inactive and immobile, subject to transforma- tion, but devoid of motion. It is one, unconditioned, indeterminate, devoid of parts, independent, and unmanifest. It is the state of equi- librium of sattva, rajas, and tamas, which are not attributes but con- stituents of prakṛti. In association with puruşa, it becomes active but unconscious, whereas purușa is inactive but conscious. According to the Bhāgavatam, the Supreme Puruşa, Mahāviṣṇu, glances at the unconscious prakṛti, thus animating it, and causing the gunas to inter- act with each other. This sets in motion a chain of cause and effect from which the manifested cosmos unfolds. (Contrast with purusa.) PRAMĀŅA Evidence; a means of valid knowing; any means by which valid knowledge of an object becomes known to a subject. Three such means of valid cognition are primary, namely pratyakṣa (perception), leanumana (inference) and sabda (revealed sound).

the Supreme Being or Immanent Self of the cosmos; the animating principle in living beings. In other contexts this can refer to the indi- vidual self, or to spirit as opposed to prakṛti (matter). It can also refer then simply to a male or mankind.

PURUṢĀVATĀRAS The three manifestations of Visnu for the purpose of cre- 
ation, also called the three Paramātmās. The first puruṣāvatāra is called Mahāviṣṇu or Karanodakaśāyi Viṣņu. He is the Paramātmā for Fb the complete extrinsic potency, prakṛti. The second is called Garbho- dakaśāyi Visnu, who is the Paramātmā for each individual universe. The third is called Kṣirodakaśāyī Visnu, who is the Paramātmā for each individual being, the jiva. The word paramātmā is commonly used for the third puruşăvatāra. 
RAJAS One of the three gunas (constituent aspects of material nature); the dynamic principle that propels the living beings to action and stimulates desires for material enjoyment. 
RASA Juice, liquor, potion; taste, flavor, relish; pleasure, delight; essence; the spiritual transformation of the heart that takes place when the

be perfected state of love for Śrī Kṛṣṇa, known as rati or bhava, is con- verted into fluid emotions by combination with various types of transcendental ecstasies. In BRS 2.1.5, bhakti-rasa is defined: "When the sthāyi-bhāva (foundational love in one of the five primary rela- tionships of equanimity, servitorship, friendship, parental affection, or conjugal love) mixes with vibhāva (excitants), anubhava (extrin- it sic ecstasy), sättvika-bhāva (intrinsic ecstasy), and vyabhicārī-bhāva (intensifying ecstasy), thus producing an extraordinary taste in the heart of the devotee, it is called bhakti-rasa." 
Rși A sage; one who has realized the Vedic mantras. 
SABDA A word; sound; the Vedas as sound revelation; a form of pramāṇa, 
i.e., evidence or a means of valid knowing. 
SADHANA Practices undertaken in various traditions as the means of 
attainment of their respective goals. 
SADHANA-BHAKTI Devotion in the stage of practice; devotion that purifies 
the heart and leads the devotee towards love of God; the practices of devotion, which can be condensed into nine primary aspects. 
SADHYA-BHAKTI The perfected stage of bhakti, when consciousness is per- meated with bhāva, the intrinsic potency of God predominated by awareness and bliss. This is the stage in which bhakti has completely transformed the being, making the self one with its own inherent nature and culminating in divine love of God. The word sadhya implies that this stage develops through sadhana (gradual culture of devotion). 
SAGUNA Related to the material influences of sattva, rajas and tamas. Bhakti is inherently free from the gunas, yet the bhakti of the performer still influenced by the gunas is called saguna. 
SAKĀMA Action performed with a desire for the fruit; duties prescribed in scripture and undertaken with a desire for enjoyment in this world and the next. Sve to get 
SAKTI Potency; the female principle of divine energy, especially when personified as the consort of the male expression of the Divine. 
SAMADHI Trance; complete absorption of all mental faculties into the one object of meditation; manifestation of the object of meditation only, devoid of the cognition of the act of meditation; the eighth stage in Patanjali's aṣṭānga-yoga system. On the path of bhakti, samadhi refers to the manifestation of the Lord along with His associates, abode and

SAMASTI Aggregate. 
SAMBANDHA Knowledge of the interrelatedness between the Supreme not Being, His potencies and the living beings. This knowledge of rela- nimation is an essential support to the practice of devotion because it 
provides a clear understanding of the nature of the world we live in, the true nature of the self, the nature of God, and the essential function of the self in relation to God. This essential function can be summed up as dasya, wherein the part finds completion through identification with and service to the whole. Through bhakti in the stage of bhava (supra-mundane awareness), this generic identity blossoms into one of the relations of personal servant, friend, par- ent or lover. In a different context, sambandha refers to one of the four indispensible elements that are described in the introduction of every Vedic literature: adhikari (qualification of the reader), visaya (the subject matter of the book), sambandha (the relation of the book as signifier with the subject or truth that it signifies) and prayojana (the purpose to be achieved by reading and following the book). SAMPRADAYA A school of metaphysical thought and spiritual discipline 
that has its source in God and which transmits its teaching in a vise disciplic chain of guru-student. 
SAMSKĀRAS The latent desires for action, whether beneficial or detrimen- 
tal, that are generated along with corresponding acts and which remain lodged in the heart of the performer; the subconscious Wimprints recorded and stored in the mind from action, thought 
and sensory perception. These imprints give rise to desire that te perpetuates the cycle of action and reaction, binding one to samsara. SAMVIT The power of consciousness; an aspect of Bhagavan's intrinsic ht bed potency by which He is conscious of all things and enables others to 
brow know. 
SANDHINI The power of being or existence; an aspect of Bhagavan's intrin- wdw sic potency by virtue of which He is self-existent and supports the 
existence of everything else. 
SANKHYA One of the six systems of Indian philosophy; the path of knowl- Who nedge involving an analysis of Spirit and matter. The founder of bethe sankhya-yoga system is the sage Kapila, who is different from 
the avatara of Bhagavan known as Kapila, the son of Kardama and bntabDevahūti. This philosophy is atheistic in nature, being devoid of the 
1072 
Glossary 
aded concept of Isvara. In this system the cosmos unfolds as the inter- play of puruşa, the self, and prakṛti, primordial nature. When prakṛti, nish which is the state of equilibrium of the three gunas, is brought into 
the proximity of the purusas, it sets in motion a chain of cause and the effect that evolves the cosmos. In course of time, the cosmos is reab- bobsorbed into its primordial state. All of this takes place to facilitate the 
purusas in the pursuit of both enjoyment and eventual liberation. In the Bhagavatam conception of Sänkhya, however, the original puruşa is Mahāviṣṇu, who activates prakṛti through His glance. SANNYASA Renounced order of life, the fourth stage of life in the varṇāśrama 
system. 
trusă 
SANNYASI A member of the renounced order; the fourth asrama (stage of 
life) in the varṇāśrama system, characterized by detachment from all worldly pursuits, indifference to social status, and full absorption in knowledge or devotion. 
SARGA The original setting in motion of the material energy by the Lord; one of ten principal topics of Srimad Bhagavatam. The topic of sarga (primary creation) deals with the generation of the five gross ele- ments (bhūtas), the five subtle sense objects (matras), the five cog- erone nitive senses (indriyas), the universal or collective wisdom faculty (mahat-tattva), and the ego [ahankara, the "I"-principle, or the prin- ciple of individuation], resulting from the displacement of the equi- librium of the three gunas [i.e., primordial nature's three interdepen- dent constituting principles of psychic and physical force], brought about through the intent of the Supreme Controller (Parameśvara). SĀRŪPYA-MUKTI One of the five types of liberation in which one attains a 
form similar to that of the Lord. ŚASTRA Scriptures, this includes the Vedas, Upanisads, Purānas, Smrtis dstv and Agamas; the authorized literature that is accepted as infallible. SAT Being or existence; that which is ultimately real.as nevegen SATTVA One of the three constituent aspects of prakṛti (primordial nature) that influences living beings toward the cultivation of wisdom and purity.

Vedas (also known as nigamas) and includes the Upanisads. SUDDHA-SATTVA The state of pure existence, beyond the three gunas 
of prakṛti; the self-luminous state of being in which Bhagavan is revealed along with His associates and abode. 
SVADHARMA That which is one's own duty. In its conventional sense this refers to the duties prescribed in scripture that relate to one's own caste and stage of life. In its transcendent sense, it refers to the nature ning and function of the pure self, distinct from all material identification. SVARUPA-LAKSANA An intrinsic characteristic; the essential character- istic of an object by which its identity is revealed. (Contrast with rio tatastha-lakṣaṇa.) SVARŪPA-SAKTI The intrinsic potency of Bhagavan that constitutes His 
very nature. It has three aspects: sandhini (the potency that accom- modates the spiritual existence of God and His associates), samvit (the impotency that is the basis of God's own omniscience and that bestows 3d transcendental awareness of Him), and hladini (the potency by which Bhagavan enjoys transcendental bliss and awards such bliss to His devotees).

UPADHI An artificial or material designation with which the eternal, tran- scendent self is identified; designations pertaining to the gross and subtle bodies. 
UPALAKSANA The implying of that which is not directly stated; a princi- 
ple often used by commentators in interpreting scriptural texts. In another context this can refer to the incidental determining charac- teristic of an object in contrast with viseṣaṇa (the intrinsic quality of an object). 
VAIKUNTHA The eternal spiritual domain; the majestic realm of the spiri- Baytual world that is predominated by Sri Narayana or His various expan- 
sions; that domain which is entirely free from the influence of the three gunas. 
VAIMUKHYA The state of having one's face turned away from the Abso- 
lute; the state of absorption in the ephemeral, rooted in causeless ring ignorance. This is the basis of samsara, and can be remedied sim- ply by turning one's face to encounter the Absolute directly, known as sammukhya. Jiva Gosvāmī says that jñāna and bhakti are the two direct methods to shift awareness towards the Absolute. Other meth- ods, such as karma, Sankhya and vairagya, may act as assistants to these two primary methods. In conclusion, however, bhakti is the sole method that engenders an embrace of the whole in completion. 
VAIRAGYA Detachment or indifference to the world; a spiritual disci- pline involving the acceptance of voluntary austerities to achieve detachment from sense objects.

Acknowledgments. 
This book is an outcome of the combined efforts, cooperation and good wishes of many individuals. I am indebted to all of them. I sin- cerely thank Sri Jaya Radha Raman Das from France for his finan- cial support for the project. Sri Jagadananda Das (Dr. Jan Brzezin- ski) did the preliminary editing. Sri Navadvip Das (Bruce Martin) did the final editing and review after thoroughly rechecking the San- skrit text. He also coined new terminology to convey the meaning of Jiva Gosvāmi's words precisely. My sincere thanks to Sri Gopinatha Das (Guy Tetreault) for his valuable suggestions for the front and back matter of the book as well as for guiding the publication team. Jaroslav Ovčáček worked very committedly to do the layout. Vrinda Devi Dasi (Vita Skoblikov) compiled the verse and subject indices. Navadvip assisted her in this work by providing descriptor phrases for the index entries. Proofreading was done by Sri Purusottama Das and Sri Advaita Das for Sanskrit and by Malati Manjari Devi Dasi, Denise McGrew, Ananta Ram Das, Subala Sakha Das and Vraja Kisora Das for English. My thanks to Dridha Vrata Das and Aljoša Basarić for the drawing of Jiva Gosvāmī, to Sonja Fink-Ocklenburg for the graphic of the tulasi plant on the front cover, as well as to Janja Pirc and Meera and Daniel Joshi for their valuable help in design- ing the cover. Malati Manjari (Miriam Saha) coordinated the work of layout, proofreading, cover design, indexing and everything else needed for this project. My very special thanks to her. I would also like to acknowledge David Březina and the Rosetta Type Foundry for supplying us with the fonts for our specific needs, and giving us valu- able suggestions and personal attention. Finally, I also thank Klaus

I thank Jaya Devi, who looks after the management of Jiva Insti- tute and thus provides me time to write. Others who have been very supportive of my service and given me encouragement include Kamala Mataji, Prof. Edwin Bryant (Advaita Prabhu Das), Dr. Partap Chauhan, and Dr. Teresa E. Warren (Hemalata Devi Dasi). My sincere gratitude to all of them.
