### Letter from President, ISKCON Bangalore Society (Pages 3-4)
**Author: Madhu Pandit Dasa**

**Key Points:**
*   **The Core Issue:** The dispute centers on the "spiritual successor" or "Acharya" position after Srila Prabhupada's passing in 1977.
*   **The 11 Appointees:** Prabhupada appointed 11 disciples to act as *ritviks* (representatives) for initiations, not as replacement *Acharyas*.
*   **The Conspiracy:** These 11 allegedly conspired to usurp the position of *Acharya*, leading to a "massive and well-organized misinformation campaign."
*   **Corruption:** This led to moral "fall-downs" involving illicit sex, drugs, child abuse, and financial misappropriation. By 2000, there were 100 self-proclaimed gurus, many of whom fell from grace.
*   **Legal Status:** ISKCON Bangalore was registered as an independent society in May 1978. It has built significant social programs like **Akshaya Patra**, feeding 13 lakh children daily.
*   **Litigation:** A trial court ruled in favor of ISKCON Bangalore's independence, but the High Court later favored ISKCON Mumbai. The matter is currently with the Supreme Court, which has ordered a status quo.

---

### Background of the Dispute (Pages 5-6)

**The History:**
*   **1965:** Srila Prabhupada travels to America.
*   **1966:** ISKCON established in NYC.
*   **1977:** After Prabhupada's passing, "decay set into the institution" because senior members went against his directions regarding succession.
*   **The Claim:** ISKCON Bangalore is fighting against the "outrageous misdeeds" of self-proclaimed gurus. ISKCON Mumbai is accused of using property litigation to sidestep the theological issue of spiritual succession.

---

### History of Theological Differences (Pages 7-10)

*   **Age of Disciples:** In 1977, senior disciples had only been in spiritual life for 6-10 years and were in their late 20s or early 30s.
*   **Succession:** The newsletter claims Prabhupada did *not* appoint anyone to ascend the *Acharya-peetha* (seat of the teacher).
*   **The July 9, 1977 Directive:** Transcript of a letter signed by Tamala Krsna Goswami and approved by Srila Prabhupada. It lists 11 disciples authorized to act as *ritviks* to perform initiations *on behalf* of Prabhupada.
*   **The Alleged Usurpation:** Immediately after 1977, these 11 "conspired to become Acharyas," accepting worship and *guru-dakshina* intended for a bonafide *Acharya*.

---

    *   Mentions **Jadurani Devi Dasi** being chased and forced into a car.
    *   Mentions **Sulocana Das**, author of *The Guru Business*, who was murdered in Los Angeles in 1986.

**Readers letter to Vijaya Karnataka (Kannada Daily)**
**Published on June 17, 2011**
*(English Translation)*

**Solve the problem**

ISKCON is a holy temple. A place where one can witness Krishna in various forms. Thousands of devotees participate in the worship of the Deities everyday. Even people belonging to other religions also come, feel happy, take prasadam and go. The temple building is very beautiful and looks like situated on a small hill. The cool and soothing atmosphere outside the temple and attractive paintings inside the temple that depict Lord Krishna's pastimes truly captivate the mind. Bhajans and devotional songs by the devotees during worship brings joy to the mind.

Their mid-day meal project has been appreciated throughout India. Lakhs of school and college students are provided with nutritious and delicious Mid day meal. Where can you get such piping hot meal that includes rice, sambar and sabji? Many children from Urdu medium schools also eat this vegetarian food and enjoy it a lot. The managers of this project serve without any distinction between caste and creed. The food they serve is prepared using modern machines. This is a great and valuable contribution to the society being rendered by them.

Such a holy temple, ISKCON has now become the target of controversy. ISKCON Mumbai has upheld its ownership on ISKCON Bangalore temple. They have been arguing that ISKCON Bangalore temple belongs to and is an inseparable part of ISKCON Mumbai. There has been no solution to this dispute. The Honourable Supreme court has given a temporary solution stating that the status quo should be maintained. I request that there should be no harm at all to the ISKCON Bangalore temple. Let the ownership rest with the present managers. Let both societies operate separately. Does it look good that religious institutions fight like this? Should protection not be given to the Bangalore managers? Should the citizens of Bangalore grow furious and come to the street? Let the Mumbai men give up their adamant attitude.

**Prof. Dr. Mumtaz Ali Khan, Minister for Haj, Wakf and Minority Welfare, Govt of Karnataka**

## Letter from President, ISKCON Bangalore Society

**Dear Patrons,**

This communication is aimed at bringing into focus the core issue behind the current dispute between ISKCON Bangalore and ISKCON Mumbai. As a patron of ISKCON Bangalore Society, we believe you should be informed about the factual position of both disputing parties and be reassured about the safe guard of your interest in your relationship with ISKCON Bangalore.

From the time His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, reverentially addressed as Srila Prabhupada, founded ISKCON in New York in 1966, ISKCON grew into a large, transnational organization spanning many countries, having 108 centers and more than 10,000 members, in a matter of 10 years. This was due to the immense spiritual stature and vision of our Founder Acharya, Srila Prabhupada.

While the growth of the organization was impressive, in 1977, just prior to Srila Prabhupada’s leaving this world, it was still a young organization and most of the members and devotees, mainly westerners, had not developed the required spiritual stature, knowledge, realization, immense purity and gravity that is required to occupy the post of his spiritual successor, as an “Acharya”.

Keeping this in mind, Srila Prabhupada appointed 11 disciples to act as Representatives of Acharya (and not as Acharyas) or ritviks. He issued an institutional directive that these ritviks would also officiate during the initiation ceremony of devotees who would join the movement. It was amply clear that these individuals would be his representatives only, and would not replace him as the Spiritual Master or Acharya of ISKCON. In other words, Srila Prabhupada was to remain, for all time, the Founder and only Acharya or Diksha guru of ISKCON.

These 11 appointees, (all of them westerners) did not heed the instructions of Srila Prabhupada. They conspired and usurped his position, started accepting disciples for themselves and began to enjoy the worship, honour, power, adulation and guru-dakshina that are offered to an Acharya, using a massive and well organized misinformation campaign, within the devotee community that they were actually appointed by Srila Prabhupada as 11 Acharyas. Any devotee who did not submit to the new system that they introduced was marginalized, stripped of services, humiliated and even expelled. Historical records state that 95% of Srila Prabhupada's original disciples left the institution in the next few years. As the corruption set in, these 11 appointed ritviks, now self-proclaimed as Acharyas had multiplied in numbers, to a total of 100 by 2000. Most of these self-proclaimed Acharyas, could not maintain the spiritual vows and fell from grace deplorably, indulging in immoral acts of illicit sex, drugs, child abuse, etc. Nine out of eleven so-called Acharyas and 35 out of the 100 have visibly fallen into acts that are unmentionable for a gentleman what to speak of sannyasis. As many kept falling from grace, more kept getting added. The story is sordid.

The ISKCON Bangalore devotees came across this treachery in 1998. From that time, ISKCON Bangalore has been peacefully contesting this rampant corruption that had set in across ISKCON worldwide. The self-appointed guru system now established in ISKCON worldwide, is using ISKCON Mumbai, as its front end to put down the protest of ISKCON Bangalore through various means such as litigations, maligning campaigns, usage of some politicians with vested interests as mouth pieces, presentation of false charges in the media as well as spreading of rumors and misinformation in the ISKCON Bangalore stakeholder community as well as the public in general.

However, the core and main guru issue has been sidelined and misrepresented to the media and in general the public, as a property issue. To clarify:

**Krishna Voice, July 2011 3**

**4 Krishna Voice, July 2011**

ISKCON Bangalore was registered under Karnataka Societies Registration Act as an independent society in the year May 1978. The current office bearers of ISKCON Bangalore, who joined after the registration of the ISKCON Bangalore society, as well as the members of the ISKCON Bangalore society have built the current grand temple, and have created from scratch, without any aid or help from ISKCON worldwide, an entire range of social service activities over a period of 10 years. These include Akshaya Patra - the world's largest privately run mid day meal program that feeds about 13 lakh children every day with the help of the central and state governments; cultural education programs that touch over 1.5 lakh children every year. ISKCON Bangalore is one of the landmarks of Bangalore receiving over 30 lakh visitors every year. It is also the largest centre distributing authentic books on Vedic literature, is the fountainhead of at least two projects that can qualify as national heritage sites in the times to come, and is actively engaged in spreading the sattvic way of life in the society. The ISKCON Bangalore society uses best practices and transparency in organization management, financial practices as well as operations management, and constantly goals itself on maximizing the value from the contributions made by its stakeholders. Most of ISKCON Bangalore programs have been lauded at the national and international level by leaders of impeccable repute.

ISKCON Mumbai, through various means described above, intends to take over the assets, programs, operations and projects mentioned above, citing a maze of complex and hazy arguments, painting office bearers of ISKCON Bangalore as wrong doers and claiming ISKCON Bangalore Society, as a branch of ISKCON Mumbai. The aim is to take over the prestigious programs and position built by ISKCON Bangalore Society and more importantly to disperse and destroy the challenge raised by ISKCON Bangalore to the self-appointed gurus of ISKCON worldwide.

The matter was litigated in the trial court and a detailed and comprehensive judgment was awarded in favor of ISKCON Bangalore, acknowledging its existence as a separate society, independent of ISKCON Mumbai. However, the matter was appealed in the Honorable High court by ISKCON Mumbai and the High Court awarded the matter in favor of ISKCON Mumbai, recognizing ISKCON Bangalore society as a branch of Mumbai. On scrutiny of the Honorable High Court's order, ISKCON Bangalore society, found considerable and significant reasons, to appeal to the Supreme Court, being confident of getting a favorable order from the Honorable Supreme Court.

Accordingly the matter was raised to the Supreme Court. The Honorable Supreme Court has advised both parties to settle the matter amicably (which ISKCON Bangalore Society has already offered to ISKCON Mumbai earlier) failing which it will consider granting leave to be appealed in early July 2011. Till such time, the Honorable Supreme Court has forbidden ISKCON Mumbai from interfering with day to day affairs of ISKCON Bangalore society and has asked both parties to maintain status quo.

We would like to assure you, that at ISKCON Bangalore, we have tried to maintain the highest standards in terms of uprightness and sense of accountability to you as a stakeholder and to society in general. We have endeavored to maintain the highest standards that behoove a spiritual organization such as ours. Not only that, we have tried to keep this dispute an internal matter, to avoid the bad taste such disputes generate for the public, as well as to keep up the august image of ISKCON. However we were compelled to bring this matter to your door steps as ISKCON Mumbai began taking the matter to the media, to which we cannot keep silent but speak the truth.

We would like to assure you, that we are ever conscious of the confidence, interest and commitment you have in us, and we intend to reciprocate, execute and keep all commitments made to you, either explicit or implicit and further commit to strive and meet expectations that you would have from an organization such as ours, in spite of the trials and tribulations being imposed upon us.

Thank you for standing by the Truth. *Satyam eva jayate.*

(Signed)

**BACKGROUND OF THE DISPUTE**
**BETWEEN ISKCON BANGALORE & ISKCON MUMBAI**

In 1965, at the age of seventy, a simple Indian sannyasi, a pure devotee of Lord Sri Krishna, boarded the cargo ship, Jaladuta, to sail to America. Neither did he have the money to set out on such a journey, nor did he know what to expect at his destination. However one thing he was sure of, his mission. As instructed by his guru, this stalwart disciple was taking a gigantic step to present to the world the message of Bhagavad-gita and other Vedic scriptures. His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada (reverentially called Srila Prabhupada) thus embarked on his monumental and historic service to God and mankind.

In July 1966, Srila Prabhupada established the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) in New York City. During the next 10 years, he relentlessly worked towards establishing a worldwide movement of over 10,000 Krishna devotees from all continents of the world.

Unfortunately soon after Srila Prabhupada's passing away in 1977, senior members of ISKCON went against his directions in the matter of spiritual succession in ISKCON. As a result decay set into the institution with deplorable fall-down from grace of self-proclaimed gurus. Many of them were convicted of illicit sexual relationships, financial misappropriations and even murder.

This is what ISKCON-Bangalore is fighting against. All this is painful, sad and unfortunate. However the truth has to be faced and these outrageous misdeeds have to be addressed for the good of society.

ISKCON-Mumbai and the international ISKCON body have been concealing the truth and exploiting our silence by perpetrating false and maligning propaganda against the devotees of ISKCON-Bangalore, even more vigorously than ever before, in order to demean our cause, and sidestep the real issue.

As supporters and patrons of this organization, we believe it is your right to be informed by us of the real issues that have transpired in this matter. We call upon your gracious support.

**Srila Prabhupada Founded ISKCON in 1966**

At the time of his passing away in 1977, Srila Prabhupada had over 5000 disciples, built 108 Krishna Temples, authored over 70 books and established a multimillion dollar international organization.

In 1977, his senior-most disciples had been in spiritual life for only about 6 to 10 years. And they were only in their late 20s or early 30s.

**Consequently he did not appoint anyone his spiritual successor, to ascend the *Acharya-peetha*.**

**Srila Prabhupada knew he did not have much time. He was anxious about the future of ISKCON.**

**INSTITUTIONAL DIRECTIVE OF SRILA PRABHUPADA ISSUED 4 MONTHS BEFORE HIS PASSING AWAY, IN THE MATTER OF SPIRITUAL SUCCESSION**

**9 July, 1977**
To All G.B.C., and Temple Presidents

Dear Maharajas and Prabhus,
Please accept my humble obeisances at your feet. Recently when all of the GBC members were with His Divine Grace in Vrndavana, Srila Prabhupada indicated that soon He would appoint some of His senior disciples to act as "ritvik - representative of the acharya, for the purpose of performing initiations, both first initiation and second initiation. His Divine Grace has so far given a list of eleven disciples who will act in that capacity:
*   His Holiness Kirtanananda Swami
*   His Holiness Satsvarupa dasa Gosvami
*   His Holiness Jayapataka Swami
*   His Holiness Tamala Krsna Gosvami
*   His Holiness Hrdayananda Gosvami
*   His Holiness Bhavananda Gosvami
*   His Holiness Hamsaduta Swami
*   His Holiness Ramesvara Swami
*   His Holiness Harikesa Swami
*   His Grace Bhagavan dasa Adhikari
*   His Grace Jayatirtha dasa Adhikari

In the past Temple Presidents have written to Srila Prabhupada recommending a particular devotee's initiation. Now that Srila Prabhupada has named these representatives, Temple Presidents may henceforward send recommendation for first and second initiation to whichever of these eleven representatives are nearest their temple. After considering the recommendation, these representatives may accept the devotee as an initiated disciple of Srila Prabhupada by giving a spiritual name, or in the case of second initiation, by chanting on the Gayatri thread, just as Srila Prabhupada has done.

**The newly initiated devotees are disciples of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, the above eleven senior devotees acting as His representative.** After the Temple President receives a letter from these representatives giving the spiritual name or the thread, he can perform the fire yajna in the temple as was being done before. The name of a newly initiated disciple should be sent by the representative who has accepted him or her to Srila Prabhupada, to be included in His Divine Grace's "Initiated Disciples" book.

Hoping this finds you all well.
Your servant,
**Signed by: Tamala Krsna Gosvami, Secretary to Srila Prabhupada**

**History of ISKCON Worldwide**

**But immediately after Srila Prabhupada’s passing away these eleven conspired to become Acharyas. They declared & installed themselves as 'Successor Acharyas'. (All eleven were foreigners)**

As representative of Acharya they were supposed to make disciples for Srila Prabhupada; but they started making disciples for themselves. Thus they started receiving all the honour, worship & even guru-dakshina for themselves from their disciples.

These self-proclaimed Gurus started accepting elaborate worship, as enjoined in the shastras to be offered to a bonafide Acharya, pure devotee of the Lord, and exploited the religious sentiments of innocent followers.

**DISOBEDIENCE OF SRILA PRABHUPADA**

[Image: Srila Prabhupada sitting in a chair]

Srila Prabhupada repeatedly warned his disciples regarding disobedience of the orders of the Spiritual Master, especially with regard to spiritual succession. He cited the example of his guru's institution, Gaudiya Mutt, where the disciples disobeyed the orders of the guru in the matter of spiritual succession. Srila Prabhupada's guru also had not appointed a successor Acharya but the disciples disobeyed the order by creating an Acharya & caused the decline of the institution. Srila Prabhupada warned that this shall not happen in ISKCON. **But unfortunately the very same thing has happened in ISKCON today.**

"My Guru Maharaja never recommended anyone to be acharya of the Gaudiya Math ... If Guru Maharaja could have seen someone who was qualified at that time to be acharya he would have mentioned. Because on the night before he passed away he talked of so many things, but never mentioned an acharya ... So Sridhara Maharaja and his two associate gentlemen unauthorizedly selected one acharya and later it proved a failure. The result is now everyone is claiming to be acharya even though they may be kanistha adhikari (spiritual novice) with no ability to preach. In some of the camps the acharya is being changed three times a year. Therefore we may not commit the same mistake in our ISKCON camp."
**Srila Prabhupada's letter to Rupanuga, April 28, 1974**

**18 Krishna Voice, July 2011**

[[19]]

**IMITATION OF SRILA PRABHUPADA**

Srila Prabhupada also warned his disciples not to imitate an exalted person. He often cited the example of Lord Krishna & Lord Shiva. One may want to imitate Lord Krishna's Rasa dance but can he lift the Govardhana Hill like the Lord did?

[Images: Two paintings: one of Lord Krishna with a gopi, and one of Lord Shiva drinking the poison]

"One should simply follow the instructions of the Lord and His empowered servants… However, one should guard against trying to imitate their actions. One should not try to drink the ocean of poison in imitation of Lord Shiva... Similarly, there are some pseudo devotees of Lord Krishna who prefer to imitate the Lord in His rasa-lila, or dance of love, forgetting their inability to lift Govardhana Hill. It is best, therefore, that one not try to imitate the powerful, but simply follow their instructions; nor should one try to occupy their posts without qualification."
**— Bhagavad-gita 3.24**

In ISKCON the self-appointed gurus have been imitating the position of Srila Prabhupada by occupying the post of successor Acharyas. **They have been receiving the honour & worship that is due to an exalted pure devotee Acharya from their disciples.**

This imitation has led to their spiritual death just as Srila Prabhupada had warned in the example of imitation of Lord Shiva.

**ANOTHER MISINFORMATION THAT ISKCON MUMBAI DISSEMINATES TO DISREPUTE MADHU PANDIT DASA: 'MADHU PANDIT DASA IS INVOLVED IN REAL ESTATE BUSINESS'**

**Clarification: Madhu Pandit Das is not personally involved in Real Estate business.** Two trusts, ISKCON Charities and India Heritage Foundation, are involved in commercial development of the trust lands. In both trusts, Madhu Pandit Dasa, along with nine other full-time missionaries, are trustees. **And none of the trustees shall receive any financial benefit from such activities - but all surpluses will be applied towards attainment of the objectives of ISKCON,** like the glorious Krishna Lila Park project - which is unfortunately struggling to manifest because of ISKCON-Mumbai's constant efforts at all levels, including government, to stop the project.

[Image: Architectural rendering of the Krishna Lila Park tower]

[Image: Photograph of a tall building with a cross]
Hundreds of Christian missions develop their lands, like Unity building on J C Road, Bangalore, in order to utilize profits for promoting the objectives of their trust.

**"REAL ESTATE business of Madhu Pandit" is a damaging and detrimental expression used by ISKCON-Mumbai simply to malign Madhu Pandit Dasa.**

**HOUSE COMMITTEE FINDINGS (GOVT OF KARNATAKA, Jan 11, 2011)**

**"The opinion given by the state's Advocate General on 20-09-2010, has revealed that there is no restriction for doing real estate business by India Heritage Trust, ISKCON Charities or any trust in pursuance of the fulfillment of its objectives.

**The tragic saga of unauthorised guru malpractices stem from blatant disobedience of the order of Srila Prabhupada**

## THE TRUTH

[Image: Srila Prabhupada sitting cross-legged on a red cushion]

**Until 1977**

"Without being empowered by the direct potency of Lord Krishna to fulfill His desire and without being specifically favored by the Lord, no human being can become the spiritual master of the whole world... Only an empowered personality can distribute the holy name of the Lord and enjoin all fallen souls to worship Krishna. Such an Acharya, or spiritual master, should be considered non-different from Krishna-that is, he should be considered the incarnation of Lord Krishna's potency. Such a personality is *krishna-alingita-vigraha*-that is, he is always embraced by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krishna."
**Sri Chaitanya-charitamrita Madhya-lila 25.9**

***

[[33]]

## THE FALLACY

[Image: A lavish gold throne with portraits of multiple western gurus on it]

**Soon after 1977**

The foolish disciple who, considering the spiritual master an ordinary man, tries to overtake him and occupy his post, immediately falls down... If one always follows the orders of the spiritual master, there is no question of falling down. As soon as a foolish disciple tries to overtake his spiritual master and becomes ambitious to occupy his post, he immediately falls down. *Yasya prasadad bhagavat-prasado yasya-aprasadan na gatih kuto 'pi.* If the spiritual master is considered an ordinary man, the disciple surely loses his chance to advance further.
**Srimad-Bhagavatam 5.12.14**

***

## THE FALL-DOWN

[Image: The gold throne tipped over, with portraits of gurus spilling out onto the floor]

**Thereafter**

The spiritual master must never be carried away by an accumulation of wealth or a large number of followers. A bona fide spiritual master will never become like that. But sometimes, if a spiritual master is not properly authorized and only on his own initiative becomes a spiritual master, he may be carried away by an accumulation of wealth and large numbers of disciples... If a person is carried away by such achievements, then his devotional service becomes slackened.

**SRILA PRABHUPADA'S LETTER ON ORGANISATIONAL STRATEGY TO KARANDHARA DASA, BOMBAY, DEC 22, 1972**

“Regarding your points about taxation, corporate status, etc., I have heard from Jayatirtha you want to make big plan for centralization of management, taxes, monies, corporate status, bookkeeping, credit, like that. I do not at all approve of such plan. Do not centralize anything. **Each temple must remain independent and self-sufficient. That was my plan from the very beginning, why you are thinking otherwise?** Once before you wanted to do something centralizing with your GBC meeting, and if I did not interfere the whole thing would have been killed..."

“Once there is bureaucracy the whole thing will be spoiled. There must be always individual striving and work and responsibility, competitive spirit, not that one shall dominate and distribute benefits to the others and they do nothing but beg from you and you provide. No. **Never mind there may be botheration to register each centre, take tax certificate each, become separate corporations in each state.** That will train men how to do these things, and they shall develop reliability and responsibility, that is the point.”

**ALLEGATIONS HURLED BY ISKCON-MUMBAI TO MALIGN MADHU PANDIT DASA**

**Allegation: Why has Madhu Pandit Dasa stated in some earlier suits prior to 2001 that ISKCON-Bangalore is a branch of ISKCON-Mumbai.**

**Clarification: ISKCON-Mumbai having been registered in 1971 and ISKCON-Bangalore being registered in 1978, there was a relationship between them as ISKCON-Mumbai being a 'big brother' right from the beginning.**

Srila Prabhupada used the term 'branch' in a non-legal sense - meaning that all ISKCON centers are branches of ISKCON Movement in spirit & faith. In the Direction of Management issued by Srila Prabhupada, he says we have 34 branches of the society all over the world, although they were all separate legal entities.

It is in the same sense Madhu Pandit Dasa used the word 'branch of Bombay' in describing the Bangalore Society, recognizing it being the first ISKCON society registered in India. Such usage is common & colloquial in ISKCON & used unmindful of its legal sense.

Taking advantage of this word 'branch' in the earlier suits, ISKCON-Mumbai wanted to claim ISKCON-Bangalore as its branch. Except in the suits, **in none of the correspondences regarding accounts or in the accounts themselves has Madhu Pandit Dasa described himself as branch president or the Bangalore Society as a branch of Mumbai Society.**

In fact, reports of the auditor of ISKCON Bangalore society (M/S Pradeep and Pradeep) which were sent with the accounts every year to Mumbai for consolidation, **describes the entity functioning in Bangalore as a society and not a branch.**

**Krishna Voice, July 2011 37**

***

[[38]]

**Allegation: Why were accounts of ISKCON-Bangalore sent to ISKCON of Mumbai till 2001?**

**Clarification: Sometime around 1981, ISKCON centers in India formed themselves into a confederation for the sake of filing consolidated accounts of ISKCON centers to Income Tax Department in one place.** This confederation was called 'ISKCON India'. And in income tax terminology it is called Association of Persons (AOP). This name ISKCON India is printed on top of all Audit Reports of consolidated balance sheets (see sample of Audit Report printed on page 39).

**ISKCON-Mumbai being oldest center was entrusted to be a nodal agent for collecting accounts of all centers each year, consolidating them and filing them before the Income Tax department under the heading ISKCON India (as seen in Audit Report) and signing on behalf of ISKCON India (see sample of Balance sheet below) and not on behalf of ISKCON of Mumbai.**

**Balance sheet as on March 31, 1989**

*   Pointer: **Please note: ISKCON Bangalore and ISKCON Bombay are listed here as constituent centres of ISKCON India along with other ISKCON Centres.**

It is to be noted that the Audit Report filed state that the attached Balance Sheet is that of ISKCON India (see above), of which both ISKCON-Bangalore & ISKCON-Mumbai are constituent centers; and **not** that ISKCON-Mumbai is the head quarter office and ISKCON-Bangalore a branch. Nowhere in the ISKCON India balance sheet there is reference to ISKCON of Mumbai as head office. This was further confirmed during the evidence led by Sri Kapadia (see page 40).

**Allegation: Why was the 80G tax exemption given to ISKCON in Mumbai used by ISKCON-Bangalore?**

**Clarification: During the evidence & cross examination led in the suit OS 7934/2001 by Sri Kapadia, Chief Accountant of ISKCON India, he has admitted that he represented that 80G tax exemption is available to all centers in India.** This is the same reason why ISKCON-Bangalore used the 80G tax exemption-under the understanding that it is given to ISKCON India.

**Krishna Voice, July 2011 39**

***

[[40]]

**THEORY OF HEAD OFFICE-BRANCH DEMOLISHED**

During the evidence & cross-examination led in the suit OS 7934/2001 by Sri Kapadia, Chief Accountant of ISKCON India, he admitted that head office has no separate funds, bank account or income and expenditure accounts of its own. **This goes to prove that the so-called head office is a myth floated to control the properties & funds of the constituent centers after the theological dispute began in 1998.** If there is no head office, there cannot be branches too. Thus there is no such, head office-branch, legal relationship between ISKCON registered in Mumbai & ISKCON registered in Bangalore.

**ISKCON MUMBAI'S SINISTER PLAN REVEALED**

In 1998, taking advantage of ISKCON-Bangalore having sent accounts for such consolidation, ISKCON-Mumbai by filing the ISKCON India accounts of ten years from 1985 to 1995 in one shot (see below) for the first time before the Charity Commissioner, began to claim the property of ISKCON-Bangalore as its own! **This came to light in 1999.**

Realizing this mischief played by ISKCON-Mumbai, ISKCON Bangalore Society, in 2001, started filing income tax returns before the IT department in Bangalore and even obtained separate 80G tax exemption.

**SRILA PRABHUPADA TELLS YASHODANANDAN DAS TO REGISTER ISKCON BANGALORE SOCIETY**
*Excerpts from a question & answer session with Yashodanandan Dasa who was one of the earliest devotees to come to Bangalore to initiate ISKCON activities in 1972*

[Image: Portrait of Yashodanandan Das]

**Krishna Voice (KV):** Can you please tell us what Srila Prabhupada said regarding ISKCON activities in Bangalore?
**Yashodanandan Dasa (YND):** I came to South India in 1972 along with Guru Kripa Swami and several devotees. When we went back to Vrindavana in the October of 1972 Srila Prabhupada was giving the series of lectures specifically on the Nectar of Devotion of Rupa Goswami. This was done at the Samadhi of Rupa Goswami just outside the courtyard of the Radha Damodar temple in Vrindavan, Mathura.

After we came back, Srila Prabhupada mentioned that he would give *sannyaas* to Guru Kripa Dasa. On one occasion when everybody had left the room, I spoke to Srila Prabhupada about Bangalore. He asked me how we were preaching there, because we were collecting money in Bangalore to build the Krishna Balaram temple in Vrindavan. So I explained that we go to Rotary Club, Lion's Club, Chamber of Commerce, we meet different gentlemen, we offer them your books (at that time the life membership was Rs. 1111/-). And people paid to become life members. I said, "But Prabhupada, everyone is asking when will you open a center in Bangalore. There are many influential people who say we will help, because we want something here." **Prabhupada said, yes Bangalore is very important place. You can open a center there, eventually we will take registration, separate registration there.**

**KV:** He said *that*?
**YND:** He said that exactly to me. Next, in 1976 when we opened the Radha Madanamohan temple in Hyderabad we had invited 12 Sri Vaishnava Brahmins. A few of them were from Bangalore, Sampat Kumar Bhattacharya, brahmins from Mysore, Ahobilam & Srirangam. They came there and did this very nice ceremony. We had heard that the local people would not accept the temple unless the installation ceremony was conducted by local Brahmins. If Westerners did it, it would not be considered a bona fide temple. So Prabhupada said okay.

They also received Prabhupada there, did Guru Puja. They did this nice *prana prathista*, *abhisheka* everything and when everything was over Prabhupada's secretary came to me and told me that Prabhupada wants to speak with me. So I thought maybe I'll get chastised, something may have been wrong. So I asked Prabhupada, "If I did anything wrong?" Prabhupada said, "No, this was very nice. So you try to arrange for preaching in South India. You go and help spread this *varana-ashrama dharma* to all these people and make Bangalore the center for preaching throughout the whole of South India."

This is because Bangalore is commercial capital, geographically centrally located and again he said, **"You take registration there. Take separate registration."** Then this Sampat Kumar Bhattacharya had a conversation with Srila Prabhupada in Sanskrit & Hindi. Afterwards I asked them what they discussed, because the name Bangalore kept coming up. I understood a little Hindi but not perfectly. He said your Guru wants to open branch in Bangalore. **He said to take separate registration there.** He says this is an important place and you should open there. So Prabhupada wanted that Bangalore should be the center for preaching, not just for Bangalore, but for the whole of South India.

**42 Krishna Voice, July 2011**

***

[[43]]

**KV:** That is exactly what ISKCON-Mumbai is saying. Prabhupada wanted a branch to be opened in Bangalore, not an independent center.
**YND:** Prabhupada's idea was different. He said open a center that will be the major center for the whole South India. The center for all the preaching in South India and **you take registration there.** Why would he mention that on two separate occasions to take registration there in Karnataka?

This devotee Shankabrit Dasa, was made a devotee when Achutyananda Swami and myself were preaching in Bangalore in 1975. Where did he get the idea to register the Karnataka Society? Because he knew that instruction which Prabhupada had given in Hyderabad in 1976. He had the center on Hare Krishna Road. He got some government building donated. No ISKCON *brahmachari* will go by himself and open a centre, take registration from the government. He had actually received instruction from the GBC at that time because they knew that Prabhupada wanted this. And the interpretation of ISKCON-Mumbai, that there can be no other branch in India but just Mumbai, is contradicted by Prabhupada's own statement regarding Calcutta.

**KV:** So your memory is very clear on these two things.
**YNP:** Yes
**KV:** About taking a separate registration in Bangalore?
**YNP:** Yes, definitely.
**KV:** Its not anything vague or…
**YNP:** It is not vague. It is not ambiguous. It is very clear. Because along with that instruction, Prabhupada also told me to go there and preach. There were two instructions. Not only that, Prabhupada also confirmed that instruction with these Brahmins who came to Hyderabad. They wanted to ask Srila Prabhupada to open branch in Bangalore. They said we were collecting money in Bangalore taking it to Vrindavan, so why not collect money in Bangalore and keep in Bangalore, flourish in Bangalore, and have a center there. Prabhupada wanted that.

## HANSADUTTA DAS ON REGISTRATION OF ISKCON BANGALORE SOCIETY
**September 18, 2008**

[Image: Portrait of Hansadutta Das]

I would be glad to share my experiences and understanding of GBC, ISKCON in India and of ISKCON Karnataka. As you know, I was one of the early member of ISKCON in New York. I was initiated by Srila Prabhupada in the year 1967. Under Srila Prabhupada’s direct instructions I opened many centers of ISKCON around the world, including in US, Canada, England, Germany, India, Sri Lanka etc.

In the year 1970, I was appointed by Srila Prabhupada as one of the first twelve members of the Governing Body Commission, an unincorporated association, delineated in the Direction of Management dated July 28, 1970. I remained a GBC even when Srila Prabhupada attained *Samadhi* in November of 1977. I first went to India in 1970 at the instruction of Srila Prabhupada to assist him in opening ISKCON...

**Krishna Voice, July 2011 43**

***

[[44]]

...centers in India with many devotees calling ourselves Prabhupada’s World Sankirtan Party. We traveled all over India performing Sankirtan, often times with Srila Prabhupada himself.

Srila Prabhupada personally asked me to enroll life members of ISKCON when he introduced Life Membership first time in the year 1970. In Dec 1970 I enrolled several life members in Indore and amounts were remitted into ISKCON accounts. These donors were offered tax exemption. I understood that the application for tax exemption under 80G was pending before the income tax authorities and was granted for all ISKCON funds in India in January 1971 soon after the first ISKCON Society was registered in India at Bombay.

As a member of the GBC I was assigned certain areas of supervision for the functioning and development of ISKCON. In the GBC meeting of March 1977 in Mayapur, in Srila Prabhupada’s physical presence, I was assigned whole of South India and Sri Lanka (then Ceylon). (The full GBC annual resolutions of years 1977-79 say this).

It may interest you to note that I was authorized by a GBC resolution of March 3, 1977, during the same annual meetings, to open a preaching center in Bangalore. The activities of ISKCON in Bangalore were being conducted by Shankabrit Das at that time. Soon after the *Samadhi* of Srila Prabhupada, **I, as the local Governing Body Commissioner, advised Shankabrit Das to register a society by the name International Society for Krishna Consciousness in Bangalore.** My advice to him was in line with the vision of Srila Prabhupada to set up legally independent centers all over the world but united and bound by the religious authority of the Governing Body Commission set up by Srila Prabhupada by the Direction of Management in 1970.

In India, as in the USA, Srila Prabhupada desired that, initially, the centers conduct their activities under the banner of one legal ISKCON Society of that country for convenience sake. After sometime when the centers could run on their own, they could legally register on their own. This policy Srila Prabhupada followed in USA as well as in India.

I was relieved of the GBC duties for the Zone of South India except Tamil Nadu at 1978 GBC meetings. Bali Mardana Das was given the zone of Karnataka, Kerala and Goa to oversee. Jayapataka Swami was given the rest of South India to oversee. I understand that finally in May 1978 the ISKCON society was registered in Bangalore and various activities were conducted to spread the ISKCON teachings in the state of Karnataka that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, are still going on.

In the next year GBC meeting in 1979, I was relieved of the GBC duties for the Zone of Tamil Nadu. I was overseeing other parts of the world at that time. Jayapataka Swami was given the whole of South India to oversee including Karnataka.

## EARLY HISTORY OF ISKCON BANGALORE
**Written as narrated by Shankabrit Das**
**Founding President of ISKCON-Bangalore**

Around 1976, devotees from different parts of India and world had initiated activities of ISKCON in different parts of South India like Bangalore, Hubli, Madras, etc. Sankirtans in the streets, enrolling life members, house programs, large public programs in pandals, were being conducted. Shankabrit Das, Amiya Vilas Das, Purna Brahma Das and Ramsharaddha Das–all disciples of Srila Prabhupada were actively involved in these activities in south India.

**44 Krishna Voice, July 2011**

***

[[45]]

In 1976, Shankabrit Das wrote to Srila Prabhupada about the complaints of several life members in south India who were not receiving the books and magazines on time. Shankabrit Das also mentioned that if a centre could be opened in Bangalore, he could coordinate the smooth supply of books and periodicals to all the life members of south India. Around September or October of 1976, Srila Prabhupada summoned Shankabrit Das to Bombay. This suggestion to open a centre in Bangalore was not well received by the senior members of ISKCON in Hyderabad, because they saw it as some kind of “an independent thinking” of Shankabrit Das, who was only junior according to them. Shankabrit Das was a leading fund raiser for ISKCON Hyderabad and did want to lose him.

But Srila Prabhupada took the communication by Shankabrit Das seriously and immediately summoned him to Bombay. Srila Prabhupada heard the objections of the Hyderabad devotees, weighed the pros and cons and overruled the objections raised by the ISKCON-Hyderabad office bearers. Srila Prabhupada saw that the proposal to open a centre in Bangalore as an opportunity to expand his ISKCON mission further in South India. He did not agree that by losing Shankabrit Das, ISKCON-Hyderabad project would be affected. In that meeting, **Srila Prabhupada appointed Shankabrit Das as the President of ISKCON-Bangalore,** and also appointed one of his senior men, Balimardan Dasa as the first GBC to oversee all activities on his behalf in South India. Srila Prabhupada separated Andhra Pradesh from rest of south India and asked Shankabrit Das if he can also revive the preaching in Madras (as Bhavabhuti Das had recently left Madras) and the centre was closed. Subsequently Shankabrit Das initiated the preaching activities in Madras, Thiruchirapalli and Trivandrum.

[Image: Portrait of Shankabrit Das]

In the GBC meetings of March 1977 at Mayapur, which was attended by Srila Prabhupada, His Holiness Hansaduta Goswami was appointed the GBC of south India and Sri Lanka replacing Balimardan Das. In this meeting on March 3, 1977, Hamsaduta Goswami was authorized by a GBC resolution to open a preaching centre in Bangalore. At that time Shankabrit Das was actively involved in the preaching activities in Bangalore.

Around that time, Shankabrit Das had come across an offer of donation of land of about 60 to 100 acres on Kanakapura Road belonging to the Maharaja of Dharampur. Shankabrit Das had also approached the then Chief Minister of Karnataka, Sri Devraj Urs for allotment of land in favor of ISKCON. A meeting was convened in the chambers of Sri Devraj Urs with the Chairman of the newly formed Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) and Shankabrit Das. In this meeting **Shankabrit Das was informed that allotment of land to ISKCON would be considered on a priority basis by BDA only if the society was registered in Karnataka.** Shankabrit Das discussed this matter with HH Hansaduta Goswami.

**SRILA PRABHUPADA'S POLICY ON STRUCTURE OF ISKCON:**
Srila Prabhupada had registered a society of the name International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) in the State of New York in 1966. Many temples were opened in the next few years in different cities like Los Angeles, San Francisco, Buffalo, etc. and all of them were functioning as branches of ISKCON of New York. As the temple activities expanded, it was Srila Prabhupada policy to incorporate separate ISKCON societies in those cities. He writes about this policy in his letter to Karandhara Dasa in 1972:

**Krishna Voice, July 2011 45**

***

[[46]]

“Never mind there may be botheration to register each centre, take tax certificate each, become separate corporations in each state. That will train men how to do these things, and they shall develop reliability and responsibility, that is the point.”
*Srila Prabhupada in a letter to Karandhara Das, Bombay, 22 Dec 1972*

According to this policy, ISKCON is registered in different cities separately and there are about 50 separately incorporated ISKCON societies in the US alone.

Following the same policy, Srila Prabhupada first incorporated a society in 1971 in Mumbai and initially his plan was to conduct the activities all over India as branch of ISKCON Mumbai. However with time as the activities expanded in different cities he would incorporate them as separate societies. By October 1974 Srila Prabhupada had approved incorporation of a separate society in Calcutta:

**30 October, 1974**
**To Whom It May Concern:**
As the Founder-Acharya of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, I authorize that the Society may incorporate under the Religious Societies Act of 1860 separately in West Bengal as the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (Calcutta) with myself as Founder-Acharya. I also appoint the following as the Trustees: Gargamuni Swami, Bhavananda Goswami, and Jayapataka Swami.
Dated this 30th Day of October, 1974, Signed: **A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami**

But for some reasons the registration of the society was not carried out.

**“DO NOT CENTRALIZE”**
Srila Prabhupada was against the principle of centralizing the control of ISKCON temples under one large corporate entity, and gave very clear directions against centralization:
“…but so far I am concerned, I have not got much stock in such centralized management or organization. I never wanted that any of my temples shall be dependent upon the other temples.” *Srila Prabhupada in a letter to Damodar Das, Bombay, 9 Jan 1973*

“Regarding your points about taxation, corporate status, etc., I have heard from Jayatirtha you want to make big plan for centralization of management, taxes, monies, corporate status, bookkeeping, credit, like that. I do not at all approve of such plan. Do not centralize anything. Each temple must remain independent and self-sufficient.” *Srila Prabhupada in a letter to Karandhara Das, Bombay, 22 Dec 1972*

Following this policy of Srila Prabhupada and considering the necessity to get land allotted by BDA, the then GBC representative of South India, HH Hansaduta Goswami directed Shankabrit Dasa in 1978 to register a society by the name International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) in Bangalore. Please see enclosed letter by Hans Kary aka Hansaduta Das of date Sept.18th, 2008.

**REGISTRATION OF ISKCON-BANGALORE**
Accordingly on May 8th 1978 the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) Bangalore was incorporated and the initial office bearers declared in the incorporation documents of ISKCON Bangalore were:

**46 Krishna Voice, July 2011**

***

[[47]]

1.  Shankabrit Dasa—President
2.  Anantha Padmanabha Das—Vice President
3.  Amiya Vilasa Das—Secretary
4.  Purna Brahma Das—Treasurer

In the same year of 1978, a grand Ratha Yatra of Lord Jagannath was held for the first time on MG Road, the most prestigious road of Bangalore city. The Ratha Yatra was inaugurated by Sri Gundu Rao, the then Transport Minister. A three-day festival was also conducted near the present Chinnaswamy Stadium, next to the Gandhi Park and nearly one lakh people attended.

**THE FIRST GENERAL BODY MEETING**
The first General Body Meeting of the newly formed ISKCON-Bangalore society was conducted on Sept. 1st, 1979, Shankabrit Das was re-elected as the President of ISKCON-Bangalore.

In 1979, Hansaduta Goswami was replaced by HH Jayapataka Swami as the GBC of south India. At that time, HH Jayapataka Swami was trying to implement and impose the Zonal Acharya System in ISKCON-Bangalore. Due to differences in opinion on the Guru issue and disgusted by seeing HH Jayapataka Swami's use of the Guru issue to divide and rule, Shankabrit Das left Bangalore and moved over to Hyderabad as Regional Secretary of Andhra Pradesh (1979-80). Later in 1980 Shankabrit Das moved over to Tirupathi to initiate the ISKCON-Bhaktivedanta Institute activities. He was involved in getting a piece of land allotted by Tirumala Tirupathi Devastanam (TTD) in 1982 and the installation of the Presiding Deities of Sri Radha Govinda in 1984.

By 1980 all of the above mentioned office bearers of ISKCON-Bangalore had become involved in different activities of ISKCON in different places and they all had left Bangalore.

In early 1983, Madhu Pandit Das became involved in overseeing the activities of ISKCON in Bangalore along with his responsibilities in Trivandrum temple. At that time also the GBC representative for Bangalore was HH Jayapataka Swami.

In 1984, HH Jayapataka Swami directed Madhu Pandit Das to meet Shankabrit Das (who was in Tirupathi at that time) to formalize the handing over of the management of ISKCON Bangalore society to Madhu Pandit Das. Subsequently a meeting was held on July 1st, 1984 and all the then office bearers resigned and those actually serving in ISKCON Bangalore were brought in as members of the society and the following office bearers were elected:

1.  Madhu Pandit Das—President
2.  Chanchalapathi Das—Vice President
3.  Pranananda Das—Treasurer
4.  Bhanu Swami—Secretary

By the year 2004, Shankabrit Das, Anantha Padmanabha Das, Amiya Vilas Das (now a Swami) and Purnabrahma Das had all become involved in different activities other than that of ISKCON Bangalore. At that time, the representatives of ISKCON Mumbai met them and wanted them to file certain statements about ISKCON Bangalore. Without paying much attention to the above facts, they signed a few papers which were later filed in the courts by ISKCON Mumbai. Only later did they realize that the statements presented in the courts did not accurately represent the facts of the matter and that signatures were obtained by deception by ISKCON-Mumbai. Hence a short account of the actual history of ISKCON-Bangalore has been recounted here above.

**Krishna Voice, July 2011 47**

[[48]]

**ISKCON-Mumbai's three-pronged malicious goals shared by the International ISKCON that devotees of ISKCON Bangalore are opposing**

1.  **No one can accept Srila Prabhupada as one's Spiritual Master (*diksha guru*) in ISKCON today. This is ISKCON Law!**
2.  **One has to accept one of the Self-proclaimed gurus who will act as Acharya. This is ISKCON Law!**
3.  **Any individual devotee or forum of devotees not accepting the self-proclaimed gurus or questioning the blatant wrongs within ISKCON will be expelled!**

**INJUSTICE TO THE ACHARYA**

Every devotee who has either joined ISKCON as a full-time missionary or is practicing Krishna Consciousness as a congregation member, has done so, and continues to do so all along his spiritual life, by coming in touch with Srila Prabhupada's teachings. **Srila Prabhupada is the primary and sole inspiration that brings everyone to Krishna Consciousness.**

But unfortunately, the moment he steps into the ISKCON organization, he is instructed to make one of the self-proclaimed gurus the object of his devotion, service and surrender. Srila Prabhupada gradually becomes just a figure-head. This is an unacceptable offence to the Acharya. Any loyal follower of Srila Prabhupada would never align with this offensive proposition.

**A PEACE PROPOSAL**
**Offered by devotees of ISKCON Bangalore Society to ISKCON worldwide, even at this point.**

The Governing Body members of ISKCON-Bangalore have presented a peace proposal with a single intention of ending the dispute between ISKCON-Bangalore and ISKCON-Mumbai so that all the resources, time and energy of devotees are used for the service of Krishna and mankind. This proposal was sent on Feb. 4th, 2009 to HH Bhakti Charu Swami, one of the senior members of ISKCON Governing Body Commission.

The peace proposal is as follows:
**Dear Bhakti Charu Maharaj,**
Please accept our humble obeisances. All glories to Srila Prabhupada.
Thanks for calling Madhu Pandit Prabhu several times in your efforts to bring in some settlement of the dispute after your meeting with Sravanananda Prabhu in the USA. Besides your efforts, Yasomatinandan Prabhu and recently Shankabrit Prabhu and Amiya Vilas Swami have been desiring that we sit and talk. Also Jagatchandra Prabhu from Cochin whom you know well and one Muralidhar Prabhu from Hubli have been trying to build bridges between the parties at the ground. Two days back Shankadhari Prabhu from Madurai also sought a sitting with a few of our governing body members to move in the direction of some settlement.

Madhu Pandit Prabhu had sent you a proposal by email after speaking to you in Bombay for which so far we have not received any response. That proposal did not envisage handing over all the properties under us to the control and ownership of the GBC but was a 'live and let live' proposal. Hence in the wake of these several further indications for a compromise we are responding with a second proposal where all properties also will be subordinated to the control of GBC.

The Governing Body Council of the ISKCON Bangalore group of temples/trusts/institutions (hereafter referred to as IB group) which was recently elected as per Srila Prabhupada's "Direction of Management", discussed at length and has the following offer to the GBC. This offer is made whether we win or lose in the current court battle for control of Bangalore temple lest it be thought that this offer is made under pressure of losing and is open for minimum 45 days (only 24 days left for court verdict to come) and maximum as much as and if extended by us at the end of 45 days.

**OFFER:**
1.  We will subordinate our entire group of organizations with all its properties legally under the direct control of GBC Body (not to ISKCON Mumbai) on par with other ISKCON temples around the world or in any manner GBC decides. But the group will continue to maintain managerial, functional and structural independence as it is existing now and the elected body of IB group of temples will manage these trusts/societies/institutions and its properties. The GBC shall have full freedom to independently audit the accounts of the IB group. The GBC shall unleash legal control only in case of financial impropriety with regard to the properties managed by the elected body of the IB Group legally under the GBC provided:
    a. The GBC rescinds the resolution that system of initiation through officiating acharya system after Srila Prabhupada's Samadhi, as per July 9th,1977 directive issued by Srila Prabhupada, is a deviant doctrine/practice.
    b. GBC passes a resolution that the officiating acharya system as per July 9th,1977 doctrine can be practiced by the IB group.
A committee of best lawyers in the country from both sides shall approve the legal effectiveness of its IRREVERSIBILITY and continued ADHERENCE by GBC. (Both these have to be done in a sound...

**Krishna Voice, July 2011 49**

...manner so that the GBC cannot go back on it after transferring legal control over properties currently held by the IB group.)

c . IB group will expand its preaching through its temples by co-existing with present temples at a respectable distance from each other, both locationally and philosophically. The nomenclature of these temples can be different to distinguish then from existing ISKCON temples. These new temples opened by IB group will work directly under the elected body of the IB group, which in turn will legally subordinate itself to the larger GBC.

d. No criticism in public of each other is permitted. Debates and discussion on mutually accepted topics can be pursued in approved forums with the objective of further narrowing down the differences over a period of time. Jointly pre-approved statements of conviction of each group and differences will alone be stated to the public, by the rank and file devotees of both parties. For the outside world there will be only two different groups who think differently on what Srila Prabhupada desired for spiritual succession.

e. Mumbai ISKCON and all ISKCON temples/projects/trusts/funds in the world should also subordinate themselves legally to the control of GBC in the same manner expected of from IB group. HH Radhanath Swami's organization/trusts/ funds also should legally come under the control of GBC.

f.. GBC should perpetuate itself through elections by electing new GBC members from among the temple presidents all over the world every three years as per the "Direction of Management" issued by Srila Prabhupada in 1970.

g.. Elected representatives from among IB group temple presidents should also be given proportionate representation in the GBC based on number of ISKCON Bangalore group temples approved by the IB group and the GBC. IB group will elect them and fill up those allotted number of the GBC position for IB group.

h. There shall be Guru puja and Vyasa puja only for Srila Prabhupada in all ISKCON temples. All persons who preside over the initiations should be called 'Officiating Acharya' in both camps. Then the only difference in two camps are that one camp hold that the new initiates are disciples of person presiding over the initiation, and the other camp holds that the new initiates are Srila Prabhupada's disciples. For the outside world it is only a different understanding of 'officiating acharya'. Officiating Acharya was the unambiguous nomenclature ordered by Srila Prabhupada for those who were to perform initiation in ISKCON in his conversation on May 28th 1977 when the GBC representatives met Srila Prabhupada with a specific question on initiations "particularly when you are no longer with us."

i. All the leaders of IB group and ISKCON should declare their personal assets to the GBC body every three years starting immediately through signed affidavits. (ISKCON Bangalore group leaders have already done it and even published in leading newspapers of Bangalore.)

j. BBT shall promote original unchanged edition of all Srila Prabhupada's books that existed before the samadhi of Srila Prabhupada by supply to all their customers who place orders and supply changed versions only on specific request of customers. The current practice is reverse of this. Just a change with regard to which edition BBT will actively promote.

k. All fight ends and in parallel we expand preaching under a single GBC body as Srila Prabhupada wanted.

Looking forward for the GBC response at the earliest. Best wishes,
**Your servants in service of Srila Prabhupada /Members of Governing Body of IB group.** Amitasana Dasa, Chitranga Chaitanya Dasa, Chanchalapati Dasa, Jai Chaitanya Dasa, Madhu Pandit Dasa, Rajiv Lochan Dasa, Satya Gourachandra Dasa, Stoka Krishna Dasa, Suvyakta Narasimha Dasa, Vasudev Keshava Dasa.

**History of ISKCON Worldwide**

**THE DARK HISTORY OF ISKCON (Post 1977)**

Srila Prabhupada incorporated ISKCON in 1966 in New York City and he oversaw the growth of the Hare Krishna Movement in the next eleven year. After touring around the world fourteen times he established 108 Krishna temples, authored over 70 books and initiated over 5000 disciples.

Srila Prabhupada did not appoint any of his disciples to be his spiritual successor (to the post of *Acharya Peetha*) as he found them to be young, immature, materially ambitious spiritual novices. Instead he appointed eleven of his disciples to act as Representatives of Acharyas or Ritviks. But soon after his passing away in 1977, these eleven disciples (all westerners) conspired to become successor Acharyas.

What happened to these eleven disciples in the years to come after the passing away of Srila Prabhupada is the dark history of ISKCON. Unfortunately, with the passing of years, the ISKCON institution has not addressed the root cause of the problem and rectified the same. As a result the dark history has become even darker!

Thousands of dismayed devotees have been working to rectify this flawed system. Since 1999 the devotees of ISKCON Bangalore under the leadership of Madhu Pandit Dasa have joined the struggle to establish the Acharya system conceived and directed by Srila Prabhupada.

We recount in the following pages what happened to the original eleven disciples who were appointed by Srila Prabhupada to be Representatives of the Acharya or Ritviks after they disobeyed his order and became self-proclaimed Acharyas?

**"We are not proud of this, however, the truth must be explained."**

## TESTIMONIALS FROM DEVOTEES

[Photo] We are deriving inspiration, enthusiasm & strength from Prabhupada’s teachings. The consciousness also has become clear after giving up the Bogus Guru System as advocated by Mumbai group.
**Adhokshaja Dasa, M Tech, IIT Chennai**

[Photo] Handing over ISKCON Bangalore temple to ISKCON Mumbai is equivalent to handing over to thieves, rogues and criminals.
**Aravinda Lochan Dasa, BTech, IIT Chennai, MS, University of Minnesota**

[Photo] If ISKCON Mumbai takes over this temple, first thing they will do is to replace Srila Prabhupada with their bogus gurus, like it has already happened in the rest of the ISKCON temples around world. It is just like separating the soul from the body.
**Jaganmohan Krishna Dasa, Temple President, Ahmedabad**

[Photo] Under the leadership of Madhu Pandit Dasa, mega social programs were taken up. The Akshaya Patra program is the testimony to this... Madhu Pandit Dasa has always encouraged devotees of the temple to take up greater responsibilities with total autonomy...
**Janardhana Dasa, Temple President, Guwahati**

[Photo] The unauthorized self made gurus and their agents... have usurped the ISKCON started by Srila Prabhupada and are cheating millions of innocent people. Those serving these gurus... will be sent to darkest regions of hell...
**Kalakantha Dasa, MBBS**

[Photo] “I am associated with ISKCON Bangalore for past 12 years. I have not found one allegation that ISKCON Mumbai has been claiming to be true. The leadership here are so transparent; they have even declared their personal assets in public & court...”
**Nishkinchana Bhakta Dasa, MBBS, Temple President, Vishakhapatnam**

[Photo] How can ISKCON Mumbai impose on us a doctrine which they themselves are unsure of, which is evident from frequent changes and amendments that they have made in appointment, worship and removal of Gurus.
**Ratnangada Govinda Dasa, B.Com, Temple President, Jaipur**

[Photo] Just by seeing this expansion of the organization into 18 centers all over the country... any intelligent person can understand that the devotees of ISKCON Bangalore are pouring their blood with a good heart, in following Srila Prabhupada’s instruction.
**Vilasa Vigraha Dasa, IIT – Guwahati, MTech – Electronics**

[Photo] It is most disgraceful today to see that for so many usurpers of his position, it is an anathema if someone considers Srila Prabhupada as his guru or even places his or her highest faith in the founder Acharya of his organization ISKCON.
**Vyomapada Dasa, Temple President, Bhilai**

[Photo] Instead of furthering the cause of preaching... the ISKCON Mumbai group have just settled down on dragging ISKCON Bangalore group to the court on so many unnecessary legal fights.

## TESTIMONIALS FROM DEVOTEES

[Photo] We are very clear and sure that the managers of ISKCON Bangalore can never be after any personal gains of property etc., as we have seen individual spiritual results in all our family members in the service of the Lord...
**Ajay Madan, Sr. Gen. Manager-Marketing, OSRAM, Delhi**

[Photo] To be a part of ISKCON congregation, we were told it was compulsory to accept the American guru... But when I learnt that one such guru has been convicted in a murder case... my faith started shaking. Next... another American guru... ran away with money and married a nurse.
**Asha R Upadhyaya, B.E., Scientist ‘D’, C.M.T.I, Bangalore**

[Photo] This entire process of reinstating Prabhupada as the only GURU in ISKCON by “ISKCON Bangalore” has been diverted to a property issue by ISKCON Mumbai. There is no truth in their words. I have practically seen ISKCON Bangalore movement grow in leaps & bounds...
**Hiren Bangera, Team Lead, UNISYS Bangalore**

[Photo] If Srila Prabhupada is replaced from his position of a Diksha guru of ISKCON, it will destroy our spiritual values and our spiritual existence. We'll end up in serving selfish power mongers, who proclaim as Gurus of ISKCON...
**K Karunakaran (Keshava Dasa), Vice President, Goloka Events, Bangalore**

[Photo] Last year, the Indian Institute of Technology, Mumbai bestowed the Distinguished Alumnus Award to Madhu Pandit Dasa... Why is a man of such integrity being attacked? What have these ISKCON Mumbai leaders contributed to the society... A little bit of digging into the past of these American gurus reads something like straight out of a Hollywood crime thriller!
**Dr. Kavitha Bhat, M.D Pediatrics, Consultant Pediatric Endocrinologist, Manipal Hospital.**

[Photo] In this world Srila Prabhupada is our only asset. He is eternally present and there is no question of his disappearance. He is our only Guru who can take us back to Godhead. Here at Srila Prabhupada's ISKCON Bangalore, devotees are centered at Srila Prabhupada as the only Diksha Guru and are following his instructions sincerely.
**Mahabhadra Dasa, Director, VINPLA Pvt Ltd**

[Photo] Massive prasadam & book distribution, youngsters taking to Krishna Consciousness... This itself shows that Prabhupada is personally present and guiding the devotees at ISKCON Bangalore. ISKCON Mumbai should not hinder this.

## TESTIMONIALS FROM DEVOTEES

[Photo] The current unauthorized gurus of ISKCON were never ordered by Srila Prabhupada to be Guru but they still claim to be gurus. How can people who do not follow Srila Prabhupada’s instructions be even termed as Gurus when they are not even his true disciples?
**Nila Madhava Dasa, Senior Engineer, GXS India Tech centre.**

[Photo] At present, only ISKCON Bangalore is following the teachings and instructions of Srila Prabhupada as it is. All other ISKCONs are under the control of self declared gurus who does not follow Srila Prabhupada’s instructions completely... I pray that ISKCON Bangalore will be victorious in their struggle for truth.
**Raghav Pandit Dasa, B.E. REC Suratkal, MD, HYDRO-LINKS FLEXIBLES PVT LTD, Bangalore.**

[Photo] There are many like me that have worked very closely with the top management of the temple and have experienced the missionary zeal in which they work, and how selflessly they serve the larger society... Ask any common man and they would say that Bangalore has been blessed with peace and prosperity because of the Radha Krsna temple and its purity...
**Sanjay Shelvankar, CEO, Scalene Works, Bangalore**

[Photo] I am an ardent supporter of ISKCON Bangalore as the leadership here is fighting to restore the position of Srila Prabhupada as the Sole Spiritual Master in ISKCON. They are not interested in property as it is being projected by ISKCON Mumbai. They have the courage to openly tell in public that they will vacate the temple if Prabhupada's position is restored.
**Shridhar Venkat, Executive Director, Akshaya Patra Foundation**

[Photo] The core topic of Guru-issue/tattva is not talked about by ISKCON Mumbai. They are only misleading the common public by diverting the real issue into the property & family control issue, which are false.
**Srinivas Kumar M, Technology Lead, Infosys Limited**

[Photo] In my long association with this temple, I would like to make people aware that this has been one of the most transparent organizations that I have ever come across....ISKCON Bangalore has stood by the right path because they maintain Prabhupada as the supreme authority... I look forward to the Theme Park that is coming up on Kanakapura Road... It will be our nation’s pride.

## TESTIMONIALS FROM DEVOTEES

[Photo] ISKCON Bangalore is that one organization, who is striving to maintain that relationship with that one great person Srila Prabhupada and provide the opportunity to serve him, only him.
**Suresh K N, Banking Consultant, SAP Canada Inc, Montreal**

[Photo] Very much proud to be associated with ISKCON-Bangalore, because it has not only reinstated Srila Prabhupada as the only diksha guru, but also for its wonderful and fantastic services to the society... I think these bogus gurus are trying all unethical and mischievous means to stop this truth because they fear that this struggle for truth soon will close their Guru business painfully.”
**Vara Prasad G, Manager, Asia Pacific, Finance & A/c, Unisys Bangalore**

[Photo] The Bangalore Temple is #1 in book distribution and Prasadam distribution. Srila Prabhupada said judge by the results so there is no doubt that he is very pleased with the dynamic preaching programs of the Bangalore Temple and it's ever expanding branches.
**Gauridasa Pandit Das, Pre 1977 Disciple of Prabhupada USA**

[Photo] Naturally they want to frame him [MPP] and make him look bad so they can think everything is okay for them. Truth will prevail! Hare Krishna!
**Jayasri Radha Devi Dasi, USA**

[Photo] ISKCON Mumbai and world wide ISKCON want to see the fall of ISKCON Bangalore because you are the shining light for the rest on the Ritviks around the world... I see Madhu Pandit as a true warrior for Krsna and Srila Prabhupada.
**Laurianne MacMillan, Canada**

Prabhupada's number one concern was/is to reclaim the conditioned souls. To make this dispute public proves that ISKCON Mumbai is cut off from Prabhupada's preaching spirit of making people have faith in Lord Caitanya's Sankirtan movement.
**Lenny Sislac**

The Bangalore Temple is filled with hundreds of devotees who have dedicated their lives to serving His Divine Grace. Their accomplishments are unrivaled by the totality of “ISKCON”.
**Padmagarbha Dasa**

Just as a man cannot live after separating his life from his body, a disciple cannot separate his Guru’s instructions from his life. Thus he becomes perfect and attains Krishna. Sri Madhu Pandit Das has understood this statement of Srila Prabhupada in its true sense. Everyday, he is supplying food in the form of Krishna prasadam... If ISKCON Bangalore is taken over by the gurus of ISKCON Mumbai, who have no respect for the order of the Guru, there will be catastrophe in the society at large.

**LETTER OF ALLEGIANCE TO THE CAUSE OF ISKCON-BANGALORE DEVOTEES**

[Image: Facsimile of a signed letter of allegiance]

We are all serving in ISKCON-Bangalore Society as full time missionaries. We joined the temple as full time missionaries, abandoning career pursuits & sacrificing family connections. Inspired by the teachings of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, we have completely dedicated our energy & life to the service of the God & mankind.

We are very much aware of the specific directive of Srila Prabhupada sent to all the leaders of his institution on July 9th, 1977, regarding spiritual succession. This is the last available written direction on the matter of how initiations were to go on after Srila Prabhupada’s departure. It is very clear from the letter that Srila Prabhupada set up a system of initiations wherein he would remain the *diksha guru* of ISKCON, even post his physical departure.

We are also aware of the treachery that has been institutionalized and the moral and financial corruptions that have been covered up to protect the perpetrators of these immoral activities...

We all have accepted Srila Prabhupada as our *diksha guru* and we are grateful to ISKCON Bangalore under the leadership of Madhu Pandit Dasa...
