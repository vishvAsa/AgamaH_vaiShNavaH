<details><summary>umang on paul</summary>

- There is no Om in mantra
- सहस्रपरिवत्सरमितकाल can not become "thousands of years and countless eons"
- how would कृष्णवियोगजनिततापक्लेशानन्दतिरोभावोऽहम् get translated into "I have been lost in pain, grief, and sorrow caused by separation from Krishna"
- how would "आप्त" people get translated into elders
- in mantra there is no verbatim for "in this world and the next" as Paul has written
- dont know how correct replacement are Almighty and Lord for भगवान्.

Om. The Lord Krishna is my refuge. For thousands of years and countless eons I have been lost in pain, grief, and sorrow caused by separation from Krishna. Together with my wife, home, children, elders, and all assets in this world and the next, I dedicate the functions of my body, senses, life, and soul to the Almighty, Lord Krishna. O Krishna, I am your servant.

For thousands of years have I been separated from my beloved Lord Krshna and that has robbed me not only of the pangs of separation, which a healthy soul, as a rule, ought to feel but also of the infinite joy that I had in his company. Here I lay down at his Lotus-Feet my body, sense organs, vital breath and my mind, together with their various functions. I also lay down my beloved, my house my progeny, my relatives and my wealth, together with my worldly as well as other-worldly belongings-not only these but even my very self. Henceforth, Oh Lord Krshna! I, your humble servant, am absolutely Yours
