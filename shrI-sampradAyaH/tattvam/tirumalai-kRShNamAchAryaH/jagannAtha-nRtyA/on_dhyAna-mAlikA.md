Dhyānamālika – Insights On Dhyānam (Krishnamacharya Tradition)

[Nrithya Jagannathan](https://www.indica.today/author/nrithya-jagannathan/) March 24, 2023


**Introduction**

Śrī Krishnamacharya, renowned yoga master and teacher to the royal court of Mysore under the reign of Krishnaraja Wadiyar IV, was an adept yogī and equally a devout bhakta and bhagavata, unflinching in his śraddhā. Once when an insurance salesman asked him to take out life insurance, he replied, “Nārāyaṇa is my insurance. I have no need for any further insurance!” Such was his conviction, which shines through his teachings and his works.

Śrī Krishnamacharya composed a poem titled Dhyānamālika in just one day in 1971 with 34 verses, he said that this composition was on “certain yoga disciplines to prepare for worship.”

For him, dhyānam was in no way separate from worship and Dhyānamālikā was conceived by him as a guide to dhyānam. He was emphatic that the ultimate purpose of yoga was to kindle and nurture bhakti. Devoid of bhakti, yoga sadhana, he felt, would only lead to short lived benefits.

This paper presents Śrī Krishnamacharya’s views and insights on the principles and practice of dhyānam as outlined in his work, Dhyānamālikā. It also incorporates some verses from another poem of Śrī Krishnamacharya, “Yogāñjalisāram,” in which he expresses clearly his views on Patañjali’s aṣṭāṅga pathway as the ideal pathway to attain the highest state of yoga.

**T Krishnamacharya’s thoughts on Dhyānam in response to questions from his students**

- What does dhyānam involve?

The foundations for dhyānam are dhyātā, dhyānam and dhyeyam. All three are beyond the perception of the senses. Therefore, they are called antara indriya viṣaya.

Among the three tattva-s, dhyātā (the jīva) and dhyeya (paramātma) are nityam (eternal) and avikārī (unchangeable). However, dhyānam, which is a nature of the mind in the sattva state is jāḍa and acetana (unconscious and ever changing).

In Yogasūtra 3.2, the term, “tatra” refers to the place where we have fixed the mind through dhāraṇa. When this focus continues and all mental activities are only towards this focus, it is called dhyānam. This place could be the heart where the antaryāmi resides for our protection.

- What is the role of the mind in dhyānam?

All the three – dhyātā, dhyānam and dhyeyam reside in the heart. The mind, through the senses, when linked to the objects, takes the form of objects. This citta, the mind, is able to act in spite of being jaḍa and acetana. This is done through the strength of the jīvātma that is supporting it. It is the same system that is involved when we are in the state of dhyānam. The mind in the state of dhyānam takes the form of the dhyeya (the antaryāmi) and presents it to the jīvātma to experience. At that time, the activities of the senses cease. Again, it should be emphasized that such a possibility only exists on account of the preliminary practice of yoga, which includes prāṇāyāma and pratyahara.

- Is there a need for a dhyeyam?

Dhyeya (object) is a must for dhyānam. The dhyeya could be the auspicious antaryāmi dwelling in the heart. The dhyeya could be in the navel or in the place between the eyebrows. It could also be in the brahmarandhra, or something outside like the sanctum sanctorum of ancient temples. The dhyeya could also be svayam vyakta vigraha.

According to Patañjali, the best dhyeya can only be the paramātma. The śabda that represents His svarūpa is praṇava. While in a state of dhyānam, it is desirable to praise Īśvara’s greatness. This bhāvana is essential.

- What is the difference between dhāraṇā, dhyana and ekagrata?

To fix the mind on a dhyeya is dhāraṇā. To continue linking the mind with it is dhyānam. This continuous focus is ekagrata.

Krishnamacharya cross references Bhagavadgīta 6.19:

_Yathā dīpo nivātasthe neṅgate sopamāsmr̥tā_

_Yogino yata cittasya yuñjate yogamātmanaḥ_

Ekāgrata, he compares to the sharp tip of a lamp when not exposed to any wind. In other words, the mind should not move anywhere else other than the direction fixed for dhāraṇā. The object for dhāraṇa and dhyānam should be the same. The stronger the dhāraṇa, the steadier the dhyānam

- What are the indications that a person is progressing in the right direction?

While practicing dhyānam the person feels light, is free from inappropriate desires, has a clear complexion, clear voice and absence of bowel and bladder ailments.

Just as doll made out of mud glows beautifully when painted, so also does the body of one who is in dhyana yoga.

The state of dhyānam is possible only in a seated posture. When sitting, the Upaniṣads proclaim that one must meditate like the earth, space or a mountain – silent and unmoving.

- What is the best form of dhanam?

**Ahaṁ graha upāsana**

When the _Jīvātman_ endowed with a mind that is free from _Rajas_ and _Tamas_ and which can transform itself into the form of the object of meditation experiences the form of the object of meditation, that state is called as _Samādhi_. Such a _Samādhi_ is attained only by the strength of the meditation on “I”.

This practice is called _ahaṁ graha upāsana_. The five preparative aspects stated in _Sūtra 1.20_ –_Śraddhā_, _Vīrya, smr̥ti, samādhi and prajñā_ are but aspects of this practice of understanding the Self.

- What are the disciplines to be observed when practicing dhyānam?

- Pleasant and auspicious object of dhyānam must be chosen
- Mithāyāsam
- Mita hita āhāram
- Mita yukta kālika nidrāmita sārthaka vāk
- Mita gupta śarīra sadhana anuṣṭhānam
- The practitioner must slowly bring the mind under control just as a rider reins in the horse. This is why an appropriate place for dhyānam also becomes essential.

- What is the dhyāna phalam?

- dr̥ṣṭa phalam – birth of healthy children, wealth, prosperity, freedom from disease
- adr̥ṣṭaphalam – sukham, ānandam, ātmadarśanam

**Insights from Dhyānamālikā**

- **The Role of the Guru**

_Prathamaṁ paśyet gurvācaraṇāṁ_

_Tataśca śr̥ṇuyāt taduktatattvam_

_Tatastu kuryāt mananaṁ saṁyak_

_Tatho’ta kūryāt śraddhāyuktaḥ_

(First bow to the feet of the Guru,

Then listen to His message.

Now, reflect repeatedly on this

And so, follow it with total conviction.)

- **Citta saukhyam**

_Kim kiṁ karoṣi kaluṣitacittam_

_Kiṁ vā jalpasi nirarthavacanam_

_Yāvaccitaṁ vimalaṁ puṁsaḥ_

_Tāvatsaukhyaṁ divivābhuvivā_

(What harm can an agitated mind not do?

What can useless talk achieve?

As long as the mind is clear,

There is sukha here and everywhere.)

- **Towards Dhyānam**

_Āsrayamaunam sthāpaya pīṭham_

_Cālayamūlaṁ vāraṁ varan_

_Kuru varan nityam mahatīṁ mudrām_

_Mahatābandhenottamavidhinā_

(In silence, establish the right posture

And activate the mūla (mūlabandha)

Mahāmudrā – day after day.

Thus practice the bandha-s in the proper way.)

_Bandhayacibukaṁ vakṣasisaṁyak_

_Cālayacordhvam mūlam muhuḥ_

_Karṣayatuḍaṁ pr̥ṣṭavilagnam_

_Sthāpayadr̥ṣṭiṁ bhr̥uvoścamadhye_

(Placing the chin firmly on the chest,

Drawing in the mūla again and again,

Pull in the abdomen towards the spine,

And place the gaze between the eyebrows).

Here, his emphasis is on tuning the entire body in preparation for dhyānam. The foundation for dhyānam is the establishment of a stable posture in which distractions are reduced and the body is not an impediment to the sadhana.

_Vinā varṇādharmaṁ kva vā cittaśuddhi_

_Vinā śuddhamannaṁ kathaṁ kāyaśuddhiḥ_

_Vinā dr̥ṣṭī śuddhiṁ kathaṁ dhāraṇāsyāt_

_Vinā prāṇa śuddhiḥ kva vā dhyana vārtā_

(How can the mind be refined without following one’s dharma?

How can the body be purified without a proper diet?

How can dhāraṇa begin without clarity of vision?

How can one think of dhyānam without regulating the breath?)

_Yamaniyamasametairāsanaiśśudhakāyaḥ_

_Prathamamathakurutvaṁ prāṇāyāmān sudīrghān_

_Tadanuca yatamānaḥ pratyahara kriyāyāṁ_

_Vijita karaṇavargo dhāraṇamārabheta_

(Respecting yama and niyama, start āsana

Refine the body, lengthen the breath.

Then, through pratyahara, discipline the senses

And then commence dhāraṇā).

_Yadā śuddhā ca siddhāsyāt dhāraṇa hr̥daye dr̥ḍham_

_Deśe’nyasmin vigrahe vā sundare sr̥utisammate_

_Ārabheta tato dhyānaṁ ekasminviṣaye ciram_

_Cittapratyayarūpaṁ tat dyeyasākāramāvahet_

(Dhāraṇā must be focused with purity on the heart

Or a beautiful idol, as ordained in the Śāstra-s.

Begin dhyānam with the mind one pointed,

As the mind takes only the form of its focus).

_Praṇavaprāṇasaṁyuktān prāṇāyāmān samabhyaset_

_Ekāgradr̥ṣṭi sahitāṁ dhāraṇāmabhyasedivā_

_Yadādr̥ḍhā dhāraṇāsyāt dhyānamavyāhataṁ bhavet_

_Avyāhataṁ dhyānameva samādhiṁ janayet sukham_

(Practicing prāṇāyāma, reciting Praṇāva,

Focusing all the senses, proceed with dhāraṇa.

Firm in dhāraṇā, dhyānam becomes stable.

Stable dhyānam easily leads to samādhi).

- **Pādādikeśam – The method – Yogāñjalisāram**

_Ādau pādau tadanu ca jañghe_

_Paścādūru nābhiṁ hr̥dayam_

_Dhyātvā bāhu sundaravapuṣaṁ_

_Sumukham lokaya gokulanātham_

(Begin from His feet,

Then move upwards towards his torso and heart.

Now, meditate on His beautiful arms,

Then look upon His charming divine face – that Lord of Gokula.)

This method of meditation, moving from the feet to the head is also referenced in Thiruppāṇālvār’s Amalanādipiraṇ pasurams. Śrī Krishnamacharya adopts this method indicating that the path of dhyānam commences by forging a deep bond with the chosen form of the Divine.

- **Saguṇa and Nirguṇa dhyānam**

_Yadā tadātvaṁ manvīthā_

_Samādhissaguṇo hi tat_

_Yadātatra bahirvastu_

_Vismr̥taṁ syāt viśeṣataḥ_

(When the mind completely

Merges with the Supreme (murti)

Nothing else remembered,

That indeed is saguṇa samādhi.)

_Ānandāścānubhūyeta_

_Samādhirnirguṇo mataḥ_

_Samādhiṁ nirguṇaṁ kecit_

_Asaṁprajñātaṁ pracakṣate_

(The experience of unalloyed ānanda

Alone is nirguṇa,

Or what some call

As asaṁprajñāta.)

_Yasmānnasaṁyak jānāti_

_Dhyeyadhyāna vibhedakam_

_Yatodake vilīnaṁ tat_

_Saindhavaṁ vibudho’pi vā_

(Now there is no distinction between

Meditation and the object –

All merged into one

Like salt in water.)

- **Dhyānaprayojanam**

_Dr̥ḍhayati cittaṁ janayati yogaṁ_

_Viśadī kurute viveka bhāvam_

_Vr̥ddhiṁ gamayatyātmānandaṁ_

_Kiṁ Vrddhi na dadātyamalaṁ dhyānam_

(Strengthening the mind, promoting the connection

With the Supreme, expanding discernment,

Sustaining the experience of ānanda

Is there anything not achievable through the perfect dhyāṇāṁ.)

_Tava vā mama vā sadānusaraṇat_

_Namanāt mananāt prasannacittaḥ_

_Bhagavān vāñcchitamakhilaṁ dattvā_

_Kinte bhūyaḥ priyamiti hasati (Yoganjalisāram 13)_

(Your Lord or Mine, it does not matter.

With a quiet mind, meditate with humility.

The Lord, pleased, gives you what you seek

And with compassionate love bestows more.)

_Nityābhyasanāt niścalabuddhiḥ_

_Satatādhyayanāt medhāsphūrtiḥ_

_Śuddhādhyānāt abhīṣṭasiddhiḥ_

_Santata japataḥ svarūpasiddhiḥ(_Yogāñjalisāram 21)

**_(_**Daily practice gives mental stability.

Regular chanting of the Veda-s improves meomory.

Perfection in dhyānam fulfills all aspirations.

Through constant dhyānam comes realization of the Self within.)

_Āsanakaraṇāttarasaṁ sarasaṁ_

_Prāṇāyāmāt prabalaṁ prāṇaṁ_

_Dhāraṇaśuddhaṁ kuru mastiṣkam_

_Dhyānāt śuddhaṁ cittaṁ nityam_ (Yogāñjalisāram 27)

(Practice āsana, make the body light.

Practice prāṇāyāma, strengthen the prāṇa

Practice dhāraṇā, strengthen the memory.

Through dhyana, purify the mind).

_Parimitabhojī sucaritayājī_

_Dhvastaśarīrakleśo yogī_

_Susthiracitto bhagavata viṣṇau_

_Ihaiva labhate śāntiṁ paramāṁ_

(With moderate diet, appropriate spiritual practices,

Reduction of impurities in the body

And meditation on Viṣṇu, the Supreme,

Here and now the highest peace is assured).
