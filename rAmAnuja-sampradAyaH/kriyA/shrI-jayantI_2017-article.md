We shall look into Śrījayantī Tiruvārādhanam and the associated anuṣṭhāna-s.

## caryā as per Munitraya Sampradāya

- One must fast the entire day during Śrījayantī
- If that is not possible, one should fast until the Tiruvārādhanam at night and can partake butter and milk that were offered to Perumāḻ.
- Even if that is impossible, one can partake light food, like that of Ekādaśī fasting.
- Whatever be the reason, one should not eat cooked rice on that day. Doing so shall beget sin.
- The rules prescribed for a day of fasting are applicable for this day. (Adorning of Sandal paste, flowers, styling of hair, chewing of betel should be avoided).
- Vrata saṅkalpa should be performed.

- In the evening, the entire house should be cleaned, decorated with kolam (rangoli), offering flowers to the Divine Feet of kr̥ṣṇa.
- It is considered special to do pārāyaṇa of Śrīkr̥ṣṇāvatāra chapter from Śrīmad Bhāgavatam; while one recites, others can listen in. 
- If possible kathā pravacana can be rendered and listened to.
- Or any kr̥ṣṇāvatāra stotra can be recited.

- One must take bath at night for Śrījayantī utsava.
- Conventions such as wearing of clean clothes, adorning of 12 Tirumaṇ kāppu during Tiruvārādhanam, should be followed.
- Tiruvārādhanam should be performed during mid night at vr̥ṣabha lagna; Kaṇṇan appeared in that vr̥ṣabha lagna.
- vr̥ṣabha lagna can be calculated from Panchangam.
  - If Śrījayantī occurs at the beginning of Āvaṇī, vr̥ṣabha lagna is approximately around 12 mid night.
  - If Śrījayantī occurs at the end of Āvaṇī, vr̥ṣabha lagna is after 10 p.m.
  - If Śrījayantī is during middle of Āvaṇī, vr̥ṣabha lagna comes around 11 p.m.
- After Tiruvārādhanam, one should partake Perumāḷ tīrtham and offer to others at home.


- It is special to stay awake at night for observing jāgaraṇa vrata.

- Special Tiruvārādhanam is performed the following day.
- It is special if ācāryapādukā-ārādhanam is done; śrīpādatīrtham can be partaken.
- Special pāraṇai should be performed as per the rules.
- Since it is a special festival, plantain and its related products can be included in the pāraṇai, say the Mahants. Generally, plantain (leaf, raw fruit, ripe fruit) signify auspiciousness, according to the scriptures. It is said plantain should be avoided during dvādaśī pāraṇai as it is the pāraṇai regulations for dvādaśī.+++(5)+++
- Some have different opinion on this.
- Whatever it is, tamarind should not be used at all during pāraṇai.+++(5)+++

## Tiruvārādhanam

- During Tiruvārādhanam saṅkalpa, one should chant kr̥taṁ ca ....śrījayantī puṇyakāle śrīkr̥ṣṇārādhanākhyena bhagavat-karmaOā bhagavantaṁ vāsudevaṁ arcayiśyāmi.
- During mantrāsana samarpaṇa, lokanāthasya kr̥ṣṇasya jayantī samupāgatā should be recited followed by śloka-s such as saṁbhr̥tāḥ.
- Special tirumañjanam should be performed with fresh cow’s milk.
- A special arghya is offered after offering dhūpadīpam during alaṅkārāsanam. The method to offer the arghya is explained in a later paragraph.
- This is followed by mantrapuLpam, arcanam and stotram.
- Later during bhojyāsanam, various delicacies along with curds and butter are to be offered. 
- Fruits, beetle leaves and nuts are offered during punarmantrāsanam.
- Special dīpa-ārati, sār̥r̥umur̥ai are performed.
- Proceed to conclude the ārādhanam.

The following morning, the usual ārādhanam is performed; this considered special as well (without the special arghya). Dāl, Tirukkaṇṇamudu are specially prepared for offering.

### Arghya

- Being with mūlamantra prāOāyāma.
- saṅkalpa - śrīkr̥ṣṇajayantī utsavārttaṁ arghyadānam kariṣye.
- Arghya is offered with tender coconut water through a conch. If conch is not available, a leaf can be used to offer.
- The conch is purified by sprinkling water on it accompanied to the chant of mūlamantra.
- At the tip of the conch, Candra is invoked by reciting ‘candram āvāhayāmi’; at the bottom, Perumāḷ is invoked with the mantra ‘janārdhanam āvāhayāmi’.
- After the invocations, dhūpa-dīpam are offered to them with the conch.
- The conch is filled with tender coconut water; sandalwood paste and flowers are added.
- Kneeling, one offers arghya to Candra and Kr̥ṣṇa.
- The following śloka is recited when offering arghya to Candra - kṣīrodārṇava-sambhūta hy atrinetra-samudbhava gr̥hāṇārghyaṁ mayā dattaṁ rohiṇyā sahitaḥ śaśin.
- Upasthāna is performed for Candra by standing up with folded palms and reciting 
  
> jyotsnāpate namas tubhyam  
> namaste jyotiṣāṁ pate  
> namaste rohiṇīkānta  
> sudhā-kumbha namostu te.

- The conch is filled with pure water with sandalwood paste and flowers added, one kneels to offer arghya to Śrīkr̥ṣṇa.The śloka recited while offering the arghya –

> jātaḥ kaṁsa vadhārthāya  
bhūbhāroddharaṇāya ca  
dānavānāṁ vināśāya  
daityānāṁ nidanāya ca  
pāṇḍavānāṁ hitārthāya  
dharma-samsthāpanāya ca  
yādavānāṁ ca rakṣārttam  
vasudeva-kulodbhava  
gr̥hāṇārghyaṁ mayādattaṁ  
devakyā sahito hare.

- These śloka-s are mantra-s; hence, śrī tirukkuḍantai deśikan says these must be learned from a preceptor.

## Śrimad Ahobila Maṭha Sampradāyam:
- In the month of āvaOi, śrījayantī is on the day when kr̥ṣṇa pakṣa aṣṭamī tithī and Rohiṇī nakṣatram occur together; but they must be associated with saptamī or kr̥ttikai even for a second. Untainted combination of aṣṭamī and Rohiṇī is required. 
- If such a day is unavailable, the next day, on navamī, if aṣṭamī tithī and Rohiṇī nakṣatram occur together and are untainted, Śrījayantī is on that day.
- Even if this combination is unavailable, the day on which mr̥gasīrśa nakṣatram occur together with navamī or daśamī tithī, Śrījayantī is on that day.
- Taking bath, pārāyaṇam and Tiruvārādhanam should be performed at vr̥ṣabha lagna.
- There is no requirement to fast separately on Śrījayantī.
- No special arghya is offered during the Tiruvārādhanam at nighttime.
- Pāraṇai is on that night itself; hence, the offerings must be made of rice, dhal, Tirukkaṇṇamudu, etc.
- Even those who fast on kr̥ṣṇa pakṣa aṣṭamī can do the pāraṇai on that night itself.

I have summarized the details to the best of my knowledge. One must learn this in a detailed manner from the elders.
