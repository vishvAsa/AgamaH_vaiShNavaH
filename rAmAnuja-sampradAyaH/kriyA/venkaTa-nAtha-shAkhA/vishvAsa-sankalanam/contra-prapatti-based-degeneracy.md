## The misunderstanding
> In 18.66, he says abandon all forms of dharma and surrender unto me. I shall liberate you from all pApa. XYZ has formally surrendered via Prapatti/BharaNyasa, and there's no need for her to do anything else according to our Acharyas and according to Krishna himself. I understand is that after Prapatti everything else is more of an anubhava for us. Because puNya and paapa are not the currencies for moksha. For those wanting to elevate to higher spiritual planets, puNya and paapa are very important. But for mumukshus, the 3 charama slokas are ultimate.

It is a widespread problem to think "My bhakti or prapatti gives me the license to do anything I want. pApa and puNya don't matter, I will get moxa." 

## Traditional opinion
This bhakti-based degeneracy is sad fact - but it has no basis in shrIbhAShyam or bhagavadgIta. I am reminded of ["राम का नाम बदनाम न करो"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl5AWfMZavA) song - modulo replacing rAma with rAmAnuja in the pallavi. Expectations from a prapanna are made explicit in uttarakriyAdhikAra of rahasya-traya-sAra by vedAnta-deshika (NAS summary [here](/AgamAH/hinduism/branches/vaiShNavaH/rAmAnuja-sampradAyaH/venkaTanAthaH/rahasya-traya-sAraH/nsa-summary/1_arthAnushAsana-vibhAgaH/15_uttarakRtyAdhikAraH/)).

### Genuine surrender
kRShNa will give you moxa at a speed commensurate with your prapatti. So, if you say "I've done prapatti. Let's abandon our AchAra, have a drink, ignore shAstra-s, forget sandhyAvandanam" etc.. etc.. ", it indicates that your prapatti to kRShNa is very shallow - I mean, what kind of "surrender" is it, if you wilfully ignore and act contrary to the words of the entity you're surrendering to. Still, kRShNa will "save" you all right - just that you might have to suffer more grief before that happens. 

> अहं त्वां मोक्षयिष्यामि  
सर्वपापेभ्यो मा शुचः 

applies to pApa-s prior to genuine prapatti (can be confirmed by reading the second case in the bhAShya of that shloka). Because if one's prapatti is genuine, why would the prapanna go do pApa-s deliberately?

The first two angas of Prapatti are: आनुकूल्यस्य सङ्कल्पः and प्रातिकूल्यस्य वर्जनम्. The others are रक्षिष्यतीति विश्वासः, गोप्तृत्व वरणम् and कार्पण्यम् (incl. आकिञ्चन्यम् and अनन्यगतित्वम्). Today people don't talk about the first two and only talk about the rest.

### Allowance for ignorance

> Even to get the knowledge of surrendering  one's dharma-bhUta-jJNAna (DBJ) is responsible. All are bound by our DBJ (Attributive knowledge) which comprises of prAraBhda karmAdi vAsanAs which determines every action we undertake.  This determines our capability and level of compliance  with shAstrAs. - harIsh

### Sincere adherence to dharma
Why would kRShNa waste his breath convincing arjuna do fight? Arjuna could just say : "whatever man - I surrender to you. Now that I've surrendered, let me go away." 

Any why would kRShNa do all this drama about "Look - even I who doesn't need to do karma am doing it" etc.. So even from a high level. there are such absurdities.

It is very important to adhere to shruti and smRtis, and adhere to scripturally ordained sAmAnya and visheSha dharmas.

### Flight analogy
> (Source: harIsh) Moksha is like taking one way flight to VaikunTha. Prapatti is like completing security check and waiting in the boarding lounge until the flight take off. While in boarding lounge if we get lost somewhere like in bars and cafe and don't show off,  we miss the flight and have to wait for the next at His mercy.

> Under very very rare circumstances like criminal acts ( Bhagawad-BhAgavatha apachaara) we might lose the opportunity to reach the destination  altogether.

## Stop misinformation
What a person can do is 

- a) make sincere effort to understand what kRShNa and rAmAnuja say, 
- b) not confuse oneself and others with superficial understanding 
- c) help clear others' misunderstandings if one can.
