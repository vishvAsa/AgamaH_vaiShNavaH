## AchAra
The entire Hindu scriptural lore lays great emphasis on acquiring spiritual knowledge and performing religious duties (called Karma) as laid down in Sastras। The latter represent practical applica tion of the rules। Both Gnanam and Anushtanam are described as the two wings of a bird, necessary for its flight। One without the other is purposeless। Ramanuja, at the ripe age of १२०, used to stand up with great effort to perform the "Arghyam" in the Sandhyavandanam because it has to be done only in this posture।

Saints are known to have adhered strictly to these directives, unmindful of the inconvenience and obstacles। Our Acharyas have prescribed, in great detail, the procedures connected with these rites। Many of these are beyond the pale of even erudites, as the source from which they have been culled out are extinct। All the duties of a religious-minded man, from dawn to night, have been compiled as "Ahnikam" and made available to posterity।

## Composition and earlier publishing
It is in this context that a brilliant Ahnikam was brought out by the २६th Head of Sri Ahobila Math (१८-११-१८३०) as "Sri Vaishnava Sadachara Nirnaya" as a standard guide। These instructions, as contained in this text, were in Telugu Script। The ४२nd Azhagiyasingar (Injimedu Swami) edited it and published it in "Grantha" letters।

## Krishnamachariar's effort
Sri Villivalam Krishnamachariar, a well-known authority in Sri Vaishnavism who has received intensive religious training under the ४२nd and subsequent Acharyas, has taken extraordinary pains to bring out the present edition both in Sanskrit and Tamil। This effort has taken several years involving physical and financial strain। 

It has to be remembered that even amongst Vaishnavites, the procedures and traditions followed by different schools vary। In the modern context, there should also be valid explanations for every one of these exercises। Many may ask as to the authority who has prescribed the particular path। 

Sri Villivalam Swami has taken enormous trouble to go deep into the innumerable references। All the doubts which may be raised have been anticipated and properly explained। In this task, another Vidwan, Sri Melpakkam Narasimhachariar has extended his guidance। The book is of immense use for all groups, because all the traditions have been enumerated।

The index that follows the main work of Ahnikam contains details relating to Upakarma, Mahalayam, Ashtaka and similar special rites। 

The third part consists of "Aasoucha Sataka" in which rules relating to the custom that should be followed when birth takes place or death occurs and similar occurences। 

In the १,१०० pages of both Sanskrit and Tamil with references from the source and with meanings and directions। Sri Krishnamachariar has packed details which cannot be had in other texts। It is a lexicon on vaishnavite religious law। 

The price is kept low as to be within the reach of everyone। It will be of great use to present generation and also to posterity because so much of research has gone into the text।

## Overview
Everyday starts around ४ a। m। There are slokas to be recited on every occasion, invoking grace of God at every stage-ablutions bathing, donning the proper dress and wearing the "Pundram"। There are various restrictions governing Achamanam and other exercises। Sandhyavandanam is of absolute necessity। How to do Pranayamam, Brahmayagnam, recitation of Gayatri Mantram and how to collect Thulasi leaves are given। 

The most important daily duty is the "Aradhana", (Puja to God) either with a small idol or with Salagramam। Added speciality in this Vademecum (Directory) are the details concerning "Pancha Maha Yagnas"। Mention must be made in this context about the special charts (Chakrams) (Vyajanakaram and Chakrakaram) in regard to the positions of the oblations offered in the Vaiswadeva Yagna। Sri Krishnamachariar has said the adoption of this procedure and then consuming the rice balls will remove sins, as declared by Krishna in Bhagavad Gita। 

The duties of women have also been clearly stated। The scriptures say "Dharmo Rakshathi Rakshitaha"। It is the bounden duty of every devotee to know all these details, adopt them in their day-to-day life to the best of their ability and earn divine grace। Asthikas of all sects should be grateful to Sri Villivalam Krishnamachariar for this painstaking work; they should not fail to possess a copy and refer to it instantaneously when doubts crop।
