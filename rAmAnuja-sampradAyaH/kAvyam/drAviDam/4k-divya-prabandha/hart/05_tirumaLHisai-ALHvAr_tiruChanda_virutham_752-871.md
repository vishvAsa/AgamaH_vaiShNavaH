819. When they leave this world,
     those base people involved in worldly pleasures like wealth
     will not achieve moksha.
     There is no way for them to go to heaven.
     If you want to survive,
     you must praise the good god Thirumāl
     adorned with fresh thulasi garlands.

820. If you see some gods, they have terrible forms
     and their praise is not sweet to the ears.
     Even if you praise them they do not have the power
     to give the boons you ask for.
     O ignorant ones!
     You live thinking they are your refuge.
     If you want to survive,
     there is only one refuge for you, our Thirumāl.
     If you wish to release yourself from births,
     worship our ancient Thirumāl..

821. The gods in the sky,
     carrying clubs, tridents, spears, drums, sticks and swords,
     ran everywhere and hid
     when Bānasuran came to fight with them.
     On that day our Thirumāl fought with him
     and cut off his thousand arms,
     and took away all the troubles of the gods.

822. When Kaṇṇan took Usha,
     and her father Bānasuran, knowing what had happened,
     came to fight with him,
     Kaṇṇan cut off his thousand arms
     and Shiva, Agni and the other gods
     who had come to help Bānasuran retreated.
     Then, the Māyan forgave the Asuran and gave him moksha.

823. The goddess Lakshmi stays on a lotus,
     the earth goddess stays with Thirumāl,
     while Nānmuhan, the god’s son, sits on the lotus on his navel.
     The sastras say that Shiva who shares his body with his wife
     became his vehicle.
     That is the truth and no one can deny it.

824. He shot his arrows
     and made holes in the seven mara trees.
     As Rāma, he shot his arrows at Vali's chest and killed him.
     Even the rulers of the sky
     will not receive the endless joy of moksha
     unless our god has given them his grace to receive it.

825. If you really know that your refuge is the feet of him
     who took the form of Vāmanan and worship him,
     you will have wealth and wonderful wisdom.
     If you praise Thirumāl
     who rests on the ocean with its clear rolling waves,
     you will not have the results of your bad karma.

826. Only those who do good tapas thinking only of the lord
     and who think constantly of the nature of Thirumāl
     will go to heaven and stay with the other gods forever.
     Except for those devotees no one can see the lovely-eyed Thirumāl.

827. Only if people control the feelings that arise from their senses
     and light up their wisdom by following the good path
     and melt in their bones and hearts for him
     and love him who carries a discus can they see him. CHECK

828. The ancient lord is eight and eight and eight,
     he is seven and seven and seven,
     and he is eight and three and one.
     Devotees worshiping with the eight letter mantra,
     “Om namo Nārāyaṇāya,” will go to heaven and rule there.

829. If people love him tirelessly
     and think of him always in their minds,
     reciting the eight-letter mantra with love
     and worshiping the beautiful ankleted feet
     of the god who rests on the snake bed on the ocean,
     they will go to heaven and rule there.

830. He is the ten directions,
     the soul of the ten guardians of the directions,
     the nine notes of music, the nine rasas of dance
     and he, the ancient and the most powerful one,
     came to this world in ten avatharams.
     Only if devotees worship him with devotion
     will they reach moksha.

831. When the Asuran Thenugam approached the lord without love
     pretending to be his friend, he cut off his arms
     but then he gave him moksa.
     No one can reach moksha except the devotees
     who worship the ankleted feet of the lord with love..

832. The lord stays in the Thiruvenkatam hills
     who churned the milky ocean
     and rests on the ocean forever.
     He gave his grace to Vāli after killing him,
     and destroyed the seven trees with one arrow
     If you worship the feet of Thirumāl you will be saved.

833. You who rest on the snake bed on the ocean,
     the highest of the high,
     are the incomparable one whom no one can know.
     If devotees have destroyed their desires
     and released themselves from attachment to the world,
     they will receive happiness here, there and everywhere in all ways.

834. O you who wear cool thulasi garlands that drip pollen,
     if someone controls his mind and worships you
     with the eight letter mantra, “Om Namo Narayanaya,”
     the joy he receives is higher than the joy of attaining moksha.

835. Does he who carries the discus
     want me to be born again?
     Does he know the day he made me love his ankleted feet?
     I am ignorant, incapable of doing anything,
     and do not know how to love him.
     O dear lord, what did you find in me
     to make me your devotee?

836. O lord resting on the snake bed,
     I know your magic.
     You know how to make my mind
     that is interested in other worldly things
     leave them and be devoted to your lotus feet.
     You are truly clever.
     If you make me fascinated with you,
     what kind of fascination is that?
     O Māyan, give me your grace
     so I am not involved in worldly things.

837. Dance, dance with your feet.
     You danced on the heads of the snake Kālingan
     stirring the water in the pond,
     O you who carry a conch in your hand.
     I worship your beautiful feet every day
     and think of you always.
     Why have you not granted me moksha yet, O Kaṇṇa.

838. You are the Vedas.
     Shiva with an eye in his forehead,
     the wise Nānmuhan staying on the lotus
     and all other gods together worship your feet with love.
     I will not speak of any other love
     except the love that I have for you.

839. My generous lord churned the milky ocean,
     using the mountain for a churning stick,
     a turtle to support the mountain
     and the white-fanged snake Vasuki for the rope.
     He took the nectar that came from the ocean,
     gave it to the gods in the sky,
     and took away their troubles.
     I will not worship any one except him.

840. You became the charioteer for Arjuna,
     destroyed the Kauravas
     and gave the land to the five Pandavas,
     sending their enemies to the sky
     and saving the earth from evil ones.
     O victorious one, I will not worship any other except you. .

841. I was not born in one of the four varnas.
     I have not learned any of the good arts
     and do not recite the Vedas with my tongue.
     I have not conquered the joy given by the senses.
     O pure one, I have no good knowledge
     and I have no refuge except your shining feet.

842. For the sake of Sita with sharp sword-like eyes
     and soft words like music
     you burned countless Raksasas in Lanka.
     I have no eyes except yours that make me see
     and no relatives to be with except you.
     You have endless magic.
     How can I ever take you from my heart?

843. O cowherd who destroyed the seven bulls
     and embraced the arms of Nappinnai and married her
     with spear-like eyes that attracted all,
     you created the oceans, you churned the milky ocean
     and you rest on it. I come to you as my refuge.
     Give me refuge, tell me, “Don’t be afraid!”

844. You, the god of Srirangam,
     adorned with a cool thulasi garland that swarms with bees,
     give your grace to those who love and worship your feet.
     You, as sweet as a bundle of sugarcane,
     are Kaṇṇan resting on the ocean.
     As Rāma, you shot powerful arrows with your bow
     and destroyed the iron forts of Lanka.

845. You who are the life in our bodies,
     our sleep and feelings,
     the five things given by the cow,
     the purity in all,
     the sky and the earth,
     the rich ocean and the things in it.
     There is nothing without you.
     You are our god and you are Rāma.

846. I have destroyed the desires that come from the evil senses
     cut off all the relations I had with others,
     and I have come to you to serve you.
     Even if you want me to have desires
     and enjoy the pleasures of the five senses,
     my only desire is to be with you.
     I have no eyes except you,
     O my king who rest on the ocean.

847. You do endless magic.
     Even if all the true seven worlds were to praise you
     for all the seven yugas, it would not be enough,
     O god worthy of limitless praise.
     O Pundariga! Please give me a boon
     so I may escape from all my endless births
     and come to your ankleted feet.

848. In your beautiful hands you carry
     a discus, conch, club, bow and sword.
     O lord with Lakshmi seated on a red lotus on your chest,
     give me your grace so I will be saved
     from the births that give sickness and sorrow.
     Show me a way to come to you.

849. I have left all the evil acts that I was committing
     and now I have no cunning or fault,
     none of the desires that the five senses bring.
     I am like a dog and my only desire is to be with you.
     O Māyan, give me the boon
     of not being born and dying anymore and I will not forget you.

850. You, the beloved of Nappinnai,
     have the color of the kāyām flower.
     My soul is tied to you.
     I hear that the messengers of Yama
     encourage people to be involved in cruel sins,
     but I have locked you up in my heart with Nappinnai
     and you save me from committing those sins.

851. You are Māyan whom no one can reach easily.
     You save people even if they are evil, forgetting all good deeds,
     thinking themselves wise and not understanding
     that births cause them suffering in this world,
     Give me your grace and make me your devotee
     so I may worship your feet through devotion for you always.

852. I want to ask you one thing,
     O you who have the color of the ocean.
     If I worship you and always want to think of you in my mind,
     won’t you also consider giving me your grace
     so I may keep your lotus feet in my heart forever?

853. O Māyan resting on the ocean with seething water,
     my love for you is limitless
     and I worship your shining lotus feet in my heart
     so that they will take away all my troubles.
     You, the victorious divine hero, took the form of a boar
     and carried Govardhana mountain
     to save the cows by sheltering them from the storm.
     O lord, tell me how I can not be born and suffer in this world.

854. O dark-colored god with the beautiful Lakshmi on your chest,
     You, are faultless, the god of gods
     and the god of justice proclaimed by the Vedas.
     Give me your grace
     so I may recite your names without ever ceasing.

855. O Māyan with many weapons in your strong arms,
     who cut off the heads of the Asuras Vakkaran, Karan and Muran
     when they came in anger to fight you,
     give me your grace so I may always worship your feet
     adorned with golden anklets
     whether I am resting, standing or walking.

856. You swallowed the earth,
     and you begged for land and took it from Mahābali,
     measuring it till there was no place you had not taken.
     O lord with lotus eyes who embrace the woman
     whose sweet words surpass music,
     there is no other color like your color.

857. O god carrying a conch, club, bow and a sword,
     your discus cut off the head of Yama
     when he came angrily to fight with you
     and you carried Govardhana mountain to save the cows
     when the storm came to destroy the cowherd village.
     My heart loves nothing except your fame
     that is spread everywhere.

858. You destroyed the angry king of Kasi,
     Vakkaran, Pavuṇḍran, the furious Maliman,
     Sumali, Kesi and Thenugan.
     I will not give my love and affection to anyone,
     only to your anklet-adorned feet.

859. Even if I received faultless boons
     and could go to the world of Nanmuhan
     filled with abundant and indestructible wealth
     or the world of Shiva
     who has the power of destroying the world
     or the world of thousand-eyed Indra,
     even if I could have all the pleasures of moksha,
     I would not accept or think of anything
     except to be with you.

860. You became a dwarf
     even though no one made you small,
     and, without anyone making you bigger,
     you became tall even though no one made you tall
     and touched the sky.
     All the sages recite the Vedas,
     praise you and say that you are the god of gods
     and you destroy the evil of the proud,
     and I join them in your praise.

861. You, Māyan, the pure one
     wearing a cool thulasi garland that swarms with bees,
     I, a dog, bow to you and worship you.
     who are colored like the ocean and rest on the water of the sea.
     You enter the thoughts of your devotees.
     Forgive all my faults and give me your grace.

862. You are the lord of the world.
     Sages say that even they who slander you like Sisupalan
     or fight with you like Ravaṇa in Lanka
     have reached your world and joined with you by your grace O Māyan.
     Take the mistakes that I, as low as a dog,
     do as good deeds and forgive me.

863. O my heart, time will pass,
     we will all get sick and grow old
     and the time of our death will come near.
     Bow to the divine feet of the god and worship him.
     You should know that being a devotee of the god
     is the only good thing. Only the feet of Thirumāl
     can give you the joy of never being born again.

864. When Nanmuhan cursed dark-necked Shiva
     in whose matted hair the Ganges flows
     and Nanmuhan’s skull was stuck to Shiva’s palm,
     our god whose chest is adorned with a fragrant garland
     gave his blood and made Nanmuhan’s skull fall away.
     O heart, think of the god’s thulasi garland and worship him
     so that you will reach his Vaikuṇṭam.

865. O heart, if you want to remove the eight bad thoughts
     and live without fault and reach moksha and rule the world,
     you must think and worship the feet of the god, our father,
     who is wisdom, the sun, and the world,
     who took the form of a single-tusked boar and split open the earth.

866. Our ruler and our mother, he destroys all our births,
     makes us his devotees and gives us his grace.
     O poor heart! He is Mukundan, the ancient one.
     If we worship him he will enter us, stay with us
     and remove our ocean of sorrow.

867. Rāma the heroic one, went to Lanka,
     fought with Ravana whose sword was mighty,
     burned it, killed Ravaṇa and conquered Lanka.
     My god does not think that I am like his enemies.
     Yama will not think of the sins
     I have done and afflict me
     because I am a devotee of the god.

868. He will take you to heaven
     removing your fears, sickness, old age
     and all your births.
     Achudan, Anandan, the lord who fulfills his promises,
     and has no beginning or end
     rests on the snake bed
     and is praised by the Vedas.

869. O lord, beloved of Lakshmi,
     I worshipped you with my words and in my deeds
     and loved you unceasingly,
     night and day, morning and evening.
     My heart worshiped your lotus feet
     and now it stays with you and will never come back to me.

870. O Māyan with the color of a kāyām flower,
     god of Srirangam surrounded by the Ponni river, hear me.
     My heart has given up my bad karma
     and worships your shining flower feet
     remaining with them without ever growing tired.

871. You, colored like a cloud, the everlasting shining light,
     took away all my future births and saved me today.
     You came to me, entered my heart and bewitched me
     and now my soul has been released from all pain
     and has attained moksha, the house of joy.
