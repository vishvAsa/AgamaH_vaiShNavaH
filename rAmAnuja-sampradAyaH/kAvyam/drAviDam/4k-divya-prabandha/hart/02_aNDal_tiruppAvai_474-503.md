Girls waking up their friends.

474. The girls come and wake up their friends. They say,
     “Today is the auspicious full moon day of Markazhi month.
     O you adorned with beautiful ornaments,
     let us go bathe. Come!
     We are the beloved young girls of the flourishing cowherd village.
     Nārāyaṇan, the son of Nandagopan,
     who looks after the cows with a sharp spear,
     the young lion of lovely-eyed Yashoda
     with a dark body, beautiful eyes
     and a face bright as the shining moon
     will give us the Paṛai.
     Come and let us bathe and worship our Pāvai
     as the world praises him.”

475. The girls come to wake up their friends. They say,
     “O people of the world!
     Hear how we worship our pāvai.
     We worship the feet of the highest lord
     resting on the milky ocean.
     We don't eat ghee, we don't drink milk,
     we bathe early in the morning,
     we don't put kohl to darken our eyes,
     we don't decorate our hair with flowers,
     we don't do evil things, we don't gossip.
     We give alms to all beggars and sages.
     Come and let us be happy and worship our Pāvai.”

476. The girls come to wake up their friends. They say,
     “Let us sing and praise the name of the virtuous lord
     who measured the world with his tall form
     and let us decorate our Pāvai and bathe it.
     If we do that, rain will fall three times a month
     without fail all over our land,
     paddy in the fields will flourish,
     fish will frolic in the fields,
     bees will sleep on the buds of the kuvaḷai blossoms
     and the cows will not hide their milk
     but yield generously to fill up the pots
     when the cowherds milk them.
     Let riches be abundant!
     Come and let us bathe and worship our Pāvai.”

477. The girls come to wake up their friends. They say,
     “O Varuṇa, you take water from the ocean.
     Do not hide your rain.
     O cloud, you enter the ocean, scoop up water and rise,
     looking like the dark form of the lord of the eon,
     making lightning like the discus that shines in the hands of Padmanabhan,
     roaring with thunder like the sound of his conch,
     and pouring rain like the arrows from his Sarngam bow.
     O Varuṇa, give us rain so that the people of the world may live happily.
     Come and let us bathe joyfully in this month of Markazhi
     and go to worship our Pāvai.”

478. The girls come to wake up their friends. They say,
     “He, the bright light of cowherd clan,
     Damodaran who made his mother's womb divine,
     the young Māyan, the king of northern Mathura,
     grew up playing on the banks of the Jamuna river
     whose water is abundant and pure.
     Faultless, we come, sprinkle flowers, worship him,
     sing his praises and think only of him in our minds.
     All the bad things we have done and may do
     will disappear like dust in fire.
     Let us go and worship our Pāvai.”

479. The girls come to wake up their friends. They say,
     “See, the birds are singing.
     Do you hear the loud calling of the white conch
     in the temple of the god of Garuḍa?
     O friend, get up.
     He, the seed of the world
     who drank the poison from Putanā's breasts
     and destroyed the cheating Sakaṭāsuran,
     rests on the ocean on the snake Adishesha.
     Sages and yogis rise and praise him saying, “Hari, Hari!”
     Listen to their praise and get up, happy in your heart.
     Let us go and worship our Pāvai.”

480. The girls come to wake up their friends . They say,
     “O crazy one, don't you hear the sound of the sparrows flocking together
     and calling “keech, keech” everywhere?
     The cowherd women with fragrant hair and many ornaments
     are churning the yogurt. Don't you hear their sound?
     You are a queen of the cowherd village.
     How can you sleep when you hear people
     singing the praise of Kesavan?
     You shine brightly! Open the door.
     Let us go and worship our Pāvai.”

481. The girls come to wake up their friend. They say,
     “The east is growing bright
     and the buffaloes leave their small sheds and go to graze.
     Women are about to do their nombu,
     but we have stopped them so they will wait for you
     and we have come to wake you up.
     Get up, cheerful one!
     If we sing his praise wishing to get the Paṛai
     and worship the god of gods who split open the mouth
     of the Asuran Kesi when he came as a horse
     and fought with the wrestlers and defeated them,
     he will give us his grace.
     That would be a wonderful thing.
     Let us go and worship our Pāvai.”

482. The girls come to wake up their friends. They say,
     “O my uncle’s daughter, it is morning
     and still you are sleeping on your bed in your room
     where the fragrance of incense spreads everywhere
     and the lamps on all sides of the palace
     studded with pure jewels shine.
     Open your beautiful door.
     O aunts, won't you wake her up?
     Doesn't your daughter speak? Doesn't she hear?
     Has some magic put her into deep sleep?
     Let us praise the god singing his many names,
     saying ‘You are the Māyan, Madhavan, Vaikuṇṭan!’
     Let us go and worship our Pāvai.”

483. The girls come to wake up their friends. They say,
     “You want to find happiness doing your nombu
     but you don’t open the door and don’t answer us.
     The virtuous Nārāyaṇan, adorned with a thulasi garland,
     will give us the Paṛai.
     Does Kumbakarṇan who fell into the mouth of Yama in battle
     make you sleep so soundly?
     You are very lazy! You are a precious ornament!
     Wake up and open the door.
     Let us go and worship our Pāvai.”

484. The girls come to wake up their friends. They say,
     “You are as beautiful as a golden vine,
     the daughter of the faultless cowherds, owners of many cows,
     who fight their enemies bravely and destroy their valor.
     You are as beautiful as a forest peacock, get up.
     Your friends in the neighborhood have come
     and stand in your front yard
     and praise the fame of the dark cloud-colored Kaṇṇan
     but you have not stirred from your bed.
     O dear girl, you have not said a word.
     Why are you sleeping like this?
     Let us go and worship our Pāvai.”

485. The girls come to wake up their friends. They say,
     “You come from a rich family.
     The buffaloes that just gave birth
     drip milk from their udders lovingly, thinking of their calves,
     and the front yard of the house is wet with their milk.
     We sing praising the names of the sweet god
     who angrily destroyed the king of southern Lanka
     but you haven’t opened your mouth.
     Wake up. Why do you sleep like this?
     Don't you know all the people in your house are up?
     Let us go and worship our Pāvai.”

486. The girls come to wake up their friends. They say,
     All other girls, singing and praising the fame of him
     who killed the evil Rakshasa Ravaṇa,
     and split open the mouth of the Asuran
     when he came as a bird
     have gone to worship the Pāvai.
     The star Guru fades and the Sukran rises.
     See, the birds are awake and chatter.
     Why are you with eyes like blossoms
     sleeping without coming with us
     to bathe and play in the cool water?
     Today is an auspicious day.
     Don’t pretend to sleep.
     Come and join us.
     Let us go and worship our Pāvai.”

487. The girls come to wake up their friends. They say,
     “See, in your backyard, in the pond in your garden,
     senkazhuneer flowers open and ambal flowers close.
     Sages, doing pure tapas and wearing clothes
     that are red like powdered brick
     go to the divine temple to blow their conches.
     O young girl, you said you would wake us up.
     Aren't you ashamed? Get up.
     You don’t do the things that you say you will.
     Come, let us sing and praise the lotus-eyed god
     with a conch and discus in his strong hands.
     Let us go and worship our Pāvai.”

488. The girls come to wake up their friends. They say,
     “You are as beautiful as a young parrot.
     What is this? You’re still asleep—wake up.!”
     She answers, “Don’t shout and wake me up.
     I am a poor girl and you are as bright as lightning. I’m coming.”
     They say, “We know your tricks. You always say this.”
     She answers, “You are the clever ones.
     Let me be what I am.”
     They say, “Come quickly. We can’t wait for you.”
     She asks, “Have all our friends arrived?”
     They say, “Yes, They’re all here.
     If you want, come and count them.
     Come and sing the praise of the Māyan
     whose strength destroys the might of his enemies.
     Let us go and worship our Pāvai.”

489. The girls take to the guards of Nandagopan's palace.
     “You are the guard of the palace of the lord Nandagopan
     who protect the doors that are decorated with flags and festoons.
     The dark jewel-colored Māyavan
     said yesterday that he would give
     a sounding Paṛai to us, the cowherd girls.
     We have bathed to make ourselves pure
     and have come to sing and wake him up.
     O guard! Don’t say this or that and make excuses.
     Open the front door of this palace!
     We are going to worship our Pāvai.”

490. The girls come to wake up Nandagopan, Yashoda,
     Baladevan and the gods, say,
     “O Nandagopalan, dear lord of the cowherds
     who give clothes, water and food to all, get up!
     O Yashoda, tender shoot among all the women who are soft as vines,
     the bright light of your family, and our dear one, get up.
     O king of the gods with feet adorned with pure golden anklets.
     You grew tall, split the sky and measured the world.
     Dear one, do not sleep. Get up.
     O Baladeva, don't sleep with your little brother.
     We are going to worship our Pāvai

     “O, fragrant-haired Nappinnai,
     daughter-in-law of strong-armed Nandagopan,
     who own of many rutting elephants, open the door.
     The roosters are calling to wake everyone
     and the flock of cuckoo birds sitting on the vines
     blooming with mādhavi flowers call out.
     Come, your fingers are beautiful and soft,
     open the door so the lovely bracelets
     on your beautiful lotus hands jingle.
     Come and join us to sing
     and praise the name of your husband.
     We are going to worship our Pāvai

492. The girls coming to wake up the god and Nappinnai say,
     “O Thirumāl adorned with garlands,
     you sleep on the breasts of Nappinnai,
     adorned with beautiful flowers on her hair,
     on a soft mattress on an ivory cot
     and the room is bright with lights.
     O Nappinnai with kohl-darkened eyes, open your mouth,
     How could you not get up and want to see your beloved?
     Surely you can understand
     that you won’t be able to be away from him for long.
     This isn’t good for you.
     We are going to worship our Pāvai

493. The girls coming to wake up the lord and Nappinnai say,
     “O dear god, if any of the thirty-three crores of the gods
     have troubles, you go and remove them.
     Get up, faultless, strong one,
     vex your enemies and take care of your devotees.
     O beautiful young Nappinnai
     with soft breasts like small cheppus,
     a red mouth and a tiny waist, get up!
     Give us fans and mirrors and send your husband with us
     so that we can praise him and go to bathe.

     that yield milk generously and make the pots overflow,

     praising you whose fame is abundant.
     We are going to worship our Pāvai

495. The girls coming to wake up the god say,
     “We have come to you affectionately, all together
     as if we were queens of this wide world,
     and we stay by your bed and worship you.
     Won't your beautiful lotus eyes
     bright as the sun and the moon,
     show us even a little grace?
     If you look at us, our karma will go away.
     We are going to worship our Pāvai

496. The girls coming to wake up the god say,
     “As you, colored as dark as a kāyam flower, wake up
     you are like a lion that has slept
     in a mountain cave in the rainy season,
     that opens its fiery eyes and roars, its mane hanging low.
     You come from your temple and sit on your majestic throne.
     Give us your grace, and help us.
     We are going to worship our Pāvai

497. The girls come, praise the god and ask for the Paṛai,

     We praise your feet.
     You went to southern Lanka and killed the Rakshasas.
     We praise your strength.
     You destroyed Sakaṭāsuran when he came as a cart.
     We praise your fame.
     When Vathsasuran came as a calf you threw him
     at Kabithasuran who had taken the form of a vilam tree
     and killed them both.
     We worship your ankleted feet.
     You carried Govardhana mountain to save the cows.
     We praise your compassion.
     We praise the spear in your hands that conquers your enemies.
     We want to serve you always and have come to receive the Paṛai.
     Give us your grace.
     We are going to worship our Pāvai

498. The girls ask for the Paṛai saying,
     “In the night you were born to Devaki
     and were raised by Yashoda.
     This is something no one knows.
     You were like a burning fire in Kamsan’s stomach
     because he always thought of giving you trouble.
     Kamsan always wanted to hurt you
     but you fought with him and killed him.
     O Neḍumāl! We worship you and have come here to you.
     If you give us the Paṛai,
     we will sing and praise your wealth and grace
     and our sorrows will go away and we will be happy.
     We are going to worship our Pāvai

499. The girls ask the god for the things that they need for their nombu
     and say,
     “O lord beautiful as a sapphire,
     we want to bathe in the month of Markazhi.
     Hear us! Give us the things we need for our nombu.
     We want to have white milk-colored conches
     that will roar and shake the earth like your conch, the pancajanyam.
     We want many good Paṛais.
     We want to be with people singing “Pallaṇḍu!”to you.
     You as a beautiful baby slept on the banyan leaf.
     Give us a eautiful lamps, flags and a roofed place to stay.
     Give us your grace.
     We are going to worship our Pāvai.”

500. The girls, coming to ask for Parais, ornaments and clothes, say,
     “O Govinda, conquerer of your enemies,
     we wish to receive a Paṛai from you and praise you.
     We want many gifts—bracelets, earrings, earrings, anklets
     and other ornaments that everyone desires
     and we will be happy to wear them.
     Wearing beautiful clothes,
     we will join together and eat rice with milk, pouring ghee in it,
     and as we eat the ghee will drip from our elbows.
     We are going to worship our Pāvai.”

501. The girls, asking for a Paṛai from the god, say,
     “We go behind the cattle to the forest
     to eat our food there.
     You were raised with simple cowherd people.
     We are fortunate to be born in the same place as you
     O faultless Govindan, we cannot give up our closeness to you.
     We, innocent children,
     call you with simple names because we love you.
     Do not get upset with us.
     Give us the Paṛai and give us your grace.
     We are going to worship our Pāvai.”

502. The cowherd girls say,
     “We come early in the morning and worship you
     and praise your golden feet. Hear us.
     Just like you, we were born in the cowherd clan.
     We want to serve you and receive the Paṛai from you.
     See, Govindan, we want to be with you always
     and we will serve you in all our fourteen births.
     Give us your grace
     and keep us from wanting anything but your service.
     We are going to worship our Pāvai.”

503. Paṭṭarpirān Kodai from Puduvai
     adorned with a beautiful lotus garland
     composed thirty Tamil pāsurams about how the girls
     with lovely moon-like faces,
     decorated with beautiful ornaments,
     went to Madhavan, Kesavan who churned the wavy ocean of milk,
     and asked for the Paṛai.
     If devotees recite these pāsurams without mistakes
     they will receive the grace of rich Thirumal,
     with a lovely face, beautiful eyes
     and twelve strong mountain-like arms
     and be happy.
