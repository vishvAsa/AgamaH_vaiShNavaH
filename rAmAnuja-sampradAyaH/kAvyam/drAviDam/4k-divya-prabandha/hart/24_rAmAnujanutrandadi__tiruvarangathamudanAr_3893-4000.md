title = "24 Rāmānujanutrandadi /Thiruvarangathamudanār (3893 -4000)"

+++

(Important Note. All the pasurams of Divayaprabandham from 1 to 3892 by twelve (eleven?) azhvars only praise the god of Vaishnavism? But the last 108 pasurams are confusing that are composed by Thiruvarangathamudanar who was probably lived in later century than 9CE. Most of the pasurams in this text seem to praise the god and probably Ramanujar. One wonders when they say whether they say 'Ramanuja?' they really mean Rāmānujar? or the god. As much as I could understand all the commentators translate the word Rāmānuja as ‘emperumanar’ including Annagarāchariyar. The text does not say anything about Rāmānujar who lived later (1017 - 1137), the author(?) of Vishishṭadvaidam.

3893. O heart!
      He embraces Lakshmi on the lotus on his chest.
      Let us worship the feet of Māṛan,
      and ask for his grace.
      Let us approach the lotus feet of the lord
      and ask him for refuge.
      Let us recite the names of Rāmānuja.

3894. O good heart!
      I will not worship the feet of those
      who will not keep in their hearts the lotus feet of the god
      of southern Srirangam surrounded with groves that drip with honey.
      My heart will not think of anything
      except the good nature of Rāmānuja
      who loves and worships the feet of the lord.

3895. O good heart! I bow to your feet.
      You took me away from selfish people
      and made me join the devotees who have the fortune
      of worshiping the sage Rāmānuja of excellent fame.

3896. The lord made me a worthy person in this world
      and he removed the results of my bad karma.
      Now no one can cause me trouble
      because I am a devotee of the highest, the Rāmānuja.

3897. If people do not agree
      that Rāmānuja's devotees are their wealth
      and blame god’s nature, that is his praise nonetheless.
      His dear devotees recite only the lord's divine names.
      They love the devotees of the lord
      no matter what family they were born in.
      .
3898. Rāmānuja composed poems with music, prose
      and good meaning.
      My poor heart longs to praise Rāmānuja with the poems
      that I have learned and composed
      but it does not know how to describe his wonderful fame with love.
      I am making an effort with my poor heart, but I am not smart.

3899. No one can measure the fame of Kurathāzvān
      who has no pride and is above everything.
      I have approached his feet and am without worry.
      I sing the fame of the lord and have escaped the bad paths
      of life through the grace of our Rāmānuja.

3900. Poyhaiyāzhvār composed pāsurams in wonderful Tamil
      with the meanings of vedantha that shine like a bright lamp
      to remove the suffering in people’s lives.
      Rāmānuja, my lord, the highest, learned them all
      and kept them in his divine heart.

3901. Bhudathāzvār composed pāsurams
      that remove the darkness in the hearts of devotees
      and light up their wisdom, showing them the paths to find god.
      Good people worship the divine feet of Bhudathāzhvar
      in their hearts and praise the fame of Rāmānuja,
      keeping in their hearts his pāsurams
      that are as precious as the Vedas.

3902. Peyāzhvār, the composer of the finest Tamil pāsurams,
      saw in Thirukkovalur the lord who has abided with Lakshmi
      after the darkness that was created by the end of the eon disappeared.
      The devotees who praise those who worship
      the golden feet of Rāmānuja are fortunate.

3903. Thiruppāṇāzhvār composed pāsurams in good Tamil
      with the meaning of the four Vedas.
      I can’t describe the power of the devotees
      in this world that is as vast as the ocean
      who worship the lotus feet of Rāmānuja

3904. The famous Thirumazhisai Āzhvar
      praised the beautiful golden feet of the lord in his heart.
      I have only love and praise for the wise devotees
      who worship the divine sage Rāmānuja.

3905. Thondaraḍippoḍi Āzhvar praised our lord
      adorned with flourishing thulasi garlands
      and composed divine Vedas
      and Tamil pasurams on the highest one.
      I worship the ankleted feet
      of the true sage Rāmānuja, my refuge.

3906. I do not do tapas on the oceans, in mountains or hot forests
      thinking that I have done bad karma.
      Rāmānuja, the highest,
      who, never tired of praising the devotees,
      bowed to the feet of Kulasekharar
      and sang his pasurams gives me courage.

3907. Periyāzhvar with his abundant love
      thought that Perumāl needs “Pallaaṇḍu”
      and composed pasurams on the lord
      that describe how the lord will live for ever.
      I will not join those who do not think of the shining fame of Rāmānuja
      who always praised Periyāzhvār.
      How could I have any trouble in my life?

3908. The lord of Srirangam saved the world at the end of the eon
      when it was destroyed by the flood and the Vedas disappeared.
      Rāmānuja, the sage praised by the world,
      is famous through the grace of Āṇḍāl who wore a garland
      that her father had prepared for the lord Rangan.

3909. The devotees of Thirumangai
      who praised the god of Thirukkaṇṇamangai
      with his beautiful Tamil pasurams will not suffer
      whether troubles come or joys come to them.
      They will approach Rāmānuja and praise him..

3910. Nammāzhvār composed a thousand pasurams
      that are like the Vedas, hard to compose,
      in sweet Tamil and spread them around the world.
      Rāmānuja helps all the good people of the world
      keep in their hearts the poet Saḍagopan
      who spread the fame of the highest lord.

3911. My lord, the beloved of Lakshmi seated on a lotus,
      who is my precious wealth and my father, mother and teacher,
      gave his grace to Nammāzhvār
      so that he could compose the Thiruvāymozhi, a classical Tamil jewel.
      Rāmānuja who spread the Thiruvāymozhi to the world is my sweet nectar.

3912. The lord gave his grace to Nādamuni
      who understood the sweetness of Tamil musical pasurams
      and spread among the people the Thiruvāymozhi
      of Nammāzhvār, born in southern Thirukkurugai.
      Rāmānuja who loves Nādamuni in his heart, is my treasure.

3913. I will not suffer by going to the doorsteps of mean people,
      praising them and saying that they are clouds that pour wealth.
      Rāmānuja who has the fortune
      of worshiping the feet of Yamunaithuṛaivan protects me.

3914. Karthikeya, Ganesa the elephant god,
      three-eyed Shiva who carries fire in his hand,
      Shakthi and the village goddess all ran away
      from the battlefield after they came to help Vānāsuran
      when he fought with Thirumāl, the ruler of the three worlds,
      but the faultless god forgave the Asuran and gave him moksha.
      Rāmānuja who worshipped the lord is my wealth.

3915. I keep in my wicked heart Rāmānuja
      whom devotees keep always in their hearts like wealth,
      and I praise him all three times of the day.
      I am happy to praise the true fame of Rāmānuja.

3916. I have done much bad karma
      and have been born many times on the earth.
      I am tired of my life.
      I do not want to join the low religions whose people do false tapas.
      I worship Rāmānuja, the true wise devotee
      who is as generous as rain and I am saved.

3917. O Rāmānuja, as compassionate as a cloud,
      who knows the grace of the lord in this world surrounded by the ocean?
      I suffer in this world. Come and save me,
      O my dear sweet life.

3918. The generous cloud-colored lord
      removed all the troubles of my karma.
      Whatever family good people are born in,
      no matter what their nature or faults,
      the lord will give them his grace and accept them.
      The fame of Rāmānuja spreads everywhere.

3919. Generously, you give your grace unceasingly to your devotees.
      Even though I have done much karma, you entered the heart of me, your slave.
      My heart suffers thinking I am not worthy for you, the shining light, to enter it.
      O Rāmānuja, my poor heart is yours.

3920. My mouth will not praise the evil people
      who do not worship the feet of the faultless lord
      who grew angry at Kamsan, the enemy of the gods,
      fought with him and killed him.
      Our lord Kaṇṇan is the beloved of Nappinnai with beautiful soft cotton-like feet.
      My life is blessed.

3921. Rāmānuja, the devotee of the lord,
      who recited wonderful Tamil Pasurams like the Vedas,
      is famous and the god will give him moksha.
      Does my fate give me the fortune of worshiping the devotees
      who understand the fame of Rāmānuja?

3922. I will not worry even if I get the joy of attaining moksha
      or if I go to hell and fall into affliction.
      Rāmānuja, my friend and ruler, praised the lord saying,
      “In our ancient world, the Māyan is the king of all creatures.”

3923. O mind, we were born limitless times in this world
      and have suffered for many years, days,
      and months, and in the present.
      We approach the ornamented feet of the god of Thennathi, praised and loved by.

3924. If devotees approach Rāmānuja,
      they will obtain beauty, patience, strength, fame and perfect wisdom.
      He protects this earth where people suffer with poverty
      and he gives them his grace.

3925. In his hands, the beloved of Lakshmi
      carries a discus, a sword, a large club, a lovely shārngam bow
      and a curved conch that sounds in the battle.
      They all are really the forms of the sage Rāmānuja
      and they protect the world.

3926. Even though the lord destroyed of all his enemies,
      the poverty of the world did not go away,
      but Rāmānuja destroys the terrible poverty
      that afflicts the people of the world.
      If I praise Rāmānuja my poverty will be removed,
      and I will have a good life.

3927. On this earth I will not worship any other god except my lord.
      I will not compose poems praising some people
      saying that they are like generous clouds.
      I will never grow tired of worshiping the beautiful flower-like feet of the lord of golden Srirangam.
      Rāmānuja makes his devotees love him and I am his devotee.
      How could the results of my karma come to me?

3928. When the divine Vedas were hidden by an Asuran in the ocean,
      the lord with a heroic discus,
      the life of all the creatures in the world,
      saved and brought them up and taught them to the sages.
      The lord Rāmānuja taught the Vedas to people
      and spread them
      so that their ignorance will be removed.

3929. The Ramayana, famous all over the world,
      praises Rāmānuja who abides in a flood of devotion
      in the temple and in the hearts of the devotees.
      The good people whose hearts melt
      as they worship the lovely fragrant lotus-feet of the lord
      guided me and made me his devotee and I am happy.

3930. I thought that I am like god and can do anything
      but he made me understand that I am his slave.
      O lord, I was like that because you made me to stay away from you.
      I know you are compassionate
      and I do not understand why I had this trouble.
      O lord, you should tell me why you have not given your grace to me.
      You are Rāmānuja and you will not go against your promise.

3931. O heart, we always think of wealth, children, lands,
      and women with beautiful hair and want them,
      worrying about how to get them.
      Our lord removed our desires
      and the troubles that they give us and gave us knowledge
      to know what is good and what will bring us fame.

3932. The wise say that the four aims of life in this world,
      moksha, wealth, dharma and good kāma,
      are are given to us by our lord Kaṇṇan.
      Ramanuja, the good-natured one, Vāmanan, said,
      “Kāma is the desire of people to obtain things in this world,
      dharma removes the sins of the devotees,
      wealth is for giving to poor
      and the love for god gives devotees moksa.”

3933. Even though our lord Mādhavan was born in this world with various forms
      people do not understand that he is our god.
      After Rāmānuja appeared in the world,
      people gained wisdom and became the devotees of Nārāyaṇan.

3934. The faultless lord Rangan, the beloved of Lakshmi
      and the lord of all the creatures of the world
      released me from the desires
      that I had for women ornamented with beautiful jewels.
      Rāmānuja gave me his faultless grace.

3935. O people of the world,
      if you praise the divine form of the god and understand him,
      the results of your good and bad karma will go away.
      Worship Rāmānuja and your difficulties will be removed.

3936. The lord who is praised by countless good devotees
      is the scholar of all the three kinds of Tamil,
      the four Vedas and all good dharmic knowledge.
      The good people of the world will demonstrate to the bad
      that fortune is to recite the divine names of Rāmānuja.

3937. Devotees understand that there is
      no better fortune than your feet, our only refuge,
      and that you are the only path for them.
      There is no way I can describe in words how we feel about you.
      We understand the truth only through your good words, Rāmānuja.

3938. The poet Māran, composed pāsurams
      on our lord who created the Vedas
      and made all other religions disappear.
      The lord entered my heart and I worship him.
      I was ignorant but now I understand him.
      We praise Ramanuja whose excellent qualities
      make him famous in all directions.

3939. The highest lord Rāmānuja,
      praised by the people as the lord, Rangan,
      has entered my heart and stays there
      night and day without leaving.
      All my bad karma is destroyed
      and there is no one equal to me.

3940. I, a mean person, can be saved only by your grace—
      I have no other refuge.
      We both need each other.
      What is the use if you do not come and stay with me,
      O Rāmānuja, praised by faultless devotees?

3941. When Rāmānuja worshiped the ornamented feet
      of the god of Srirangam surrounded by fields
      where honey from lotus flowers flows like a river,
      the six false religions were destroyed
      and cruel poverty went away

3942. The feet of Rāmānuja flourish in the thoughts of good people
      and they disappear in the bad.
      Praised by sages from ancient times,
      they accepted my poor poems.

3943. Our lord, the king
      who fought for the Pandavas in the Bharatha war
      and drove the chariot for Arjuna,
      nectar for his devotees, was born as Rāmānuja.
      If I try to find the reason for his birth,
      I discover it was only to rule me.

3944. These are the wonders that Rāmānuja did for me.
      He destroyed the fame of the six religions
      and became known in all the world.
      He entered my heart,
      removed the results of my good and bad karma
      and made me joyfully join his feet.

3945. Rāmānuja, wonderful good-natured lord,
      is the highest one who created all the creatures of the world
      and is loved by learned people.
      He, as generous as a karpaga tree, came to rule me.

3946. Because of the good nature of Rāmānuja,
      the bad religions all disappeared,
      the Vedas that praise the lord Nāraṇan rejoiced
      and the divine Tamil Veda of the generous poet
      of southern Thirukkurugai flourished.

3947. He, generous as a cloud, showed his grace,
      saved all the Vedas at the end of the eon
      and gave them to the world.
      The devotees of the lord
      join together happily in southern Srirangam
      surrounded with fragrant groves that attract the eyes of all.
      The clan of the people who worship Rāmānuja is the family that rules us.

3948. He is the king of a cowherd village,
      the conquerer of Parasurāma praised by the whole world
      who defeatedtwenty-one generations of kings with his sharp mazu.
      I have approached that famous Rāmānuja—
      my tongue will not praise anyone else,
      and my mind will not think of anything else.

3949. Rāmānuja, praised by good people,
      believes that the devotees who worship
      only the lotus feet of the lord of Srirangam
      and no other gods are his relatives.
      I have approached him and he is my lord—
      I will not be ignorant any more.

3950. There are Vedanta scholars who say,
      “This is the meaning of the Vedas.
      The highest is Brahman and all the souls will leave the body
      and join the ancient Paraman.”
      Rāmānuja, the ocean of truth argued with them
      and defeated them in disputation about Vedanta.

3951. At the time the Advaita philosophy
      was spreading in all the eight directions
      surrounded with oceans
      and the darkness of poverty covered the world,
      if Rāmānuja had not removed the darkness with the light of his knowledge,
      no one would understand that the god who contains all life is Nāraṇan.

3952. The lord, who embraces Lakshmi on his golden chest
      abides in all the yoga of enlightened ones of true knowledge
      and in the sweet music of the Thiruvaymozhi.
      The fame of Rāmānuja, the tender shoot of our family,
      spreads everywhere.

3953. The lord came and gave his grace
      to save me from the results of my bad karma
      that burned like a hot fire.
      The fame of Rāmānuja whose tapas is praised by sages
      spreads like a light over this earth
      and the divine world has seen the wonder of it.

3954. I have removed the desire caused by my karma
      and have no worries.
      I worship only the feet of the devotees
      who praise the beautiful lotus feet of Rāmānuja—
      I will not worship the gods
      who do nothing good for the devotees of my lord.

3955. Give me your grace so I may follow
      your shining feet like a male elephant that follows his mate.
      Rāmānuja made the followers of the six dark religions
      run away and made others follow our lord’s religion.

3956. Our sage Rāmānuja, strong like an elephant dripping ichor,
      spreads in the world the joy of Tamil pasurams,
      the true Veda composed by Nammāzhvar.
      O you who want to argue, he will stand against you
      and defeat you with his philosophy.

3957. He argued with the scholars of other religions and defeated them.
      The Vediyars have been defeated
      and the earth is fortunate because of his tapas.
      Rāmānuja, whose philosophy has become famous,
      gave wisdom to good people
      and they spread it with their tongues and learned the sastras.

3958. Mādhavan gives moksha to his devotees
      as they become ever wiser.
      I have done bad karma.
      I pray that Rāmānuja will remove the faults of my heart
      and give me his grace.

3959. When the Pandava Dharma,worshiped the feet
      of the lord and asked for his help,
      Māyavan destroyed Duriyodhana
      and his hundred brothers in the Bharatha war.
      If Rāmānuja does not protect the people of the world
      who will protect them?

3960. The lord Māyan taught the Gita to Arjuna
      as they rode on a chariot in the Bharatha war.
      Rāmānuja spread the divine teaching of the lord in the world
      and I worship his feet.
      My life and thoughts bow to his devotees who worshiped him.

3961. When my senses hurt
      and I could not survive,
      the lord Rangan did not come to me and give me his grace
      but now my father Rāmānuja has come and helps me.

3962. You have countless wonderful qualities
      and you saw me and my nature and came to help me.
      Even considering my confused nature you gave me your compassion,
      O Rāmānuja, your devotees look at my faults with compassion and forgive me.

3963. My heart bows to your lotus feet.
      I love you and all my activities are for you.
      My love for your feet is strong
      and the results of my karma are removed through your compassion.

3964. If people follow other religions than our god’s,
      Rāmānuja dislikes them and he saves the people of the world from them.
      He thought only of the pure Vedic path.
      I praise the devotees of generous Rāmānuja whom he made me join.

3965. Rāmānuja with his ability, compassion and wisdom
      taught the people of the world truth and wisdom through his grace.
      Ramanuja gave true knowledge to all the devotees
      and I do not know any other way to be than to think of Rāmānuja.

3966. The lord Māyavan uses his discus and destroys
      bad people who do not know the path of the divine Vedas.
      Rāmānuja uses his wisdom and destroys
      those who do not know the divine Vedas.

3967. The lord of Srirangam on the banks of the Kaviri
      filled with pearls, fish and conches
      carries a discus and a conch in his hands and promises his devotees,
      “I will not leave you and I will remove your troubles.”
      O Rāmānuja, your beauty and fame come and surround me.

3968. The wide ocean and the golden hills of Thiruvenkaṭam,
      Vaikuṇḍam, the ocean of milk and the lotus feet of the lord
      all give pleasure to you, Rāmānuja,
      and you give me those pleasures also.

3969. Rāmānuja argued with the philosophers of other religions
      and became famous all through the world.
      He removed the results of my karma.
      How could he have done anything more for me?
      He gives me sweet grace that he gives to no one else.

3970. O Rāmānuja, concerned about my worries
      you removed the evil thoughts from my heart and helped me,
      making me a slave of the beloved of divine Lakshmi.
      No other thoughts enter my mind, only your true teachings.

3971. There are many religions that spread false teachings
      and people believe in them and do not think of the lord who will save us.
      Rāmānuja will show them the true way to reach god—
      they should give up their worrying and not doubt him.

3972. If the devotees worship the divine name of Rāmānuja
      and think of his power only
      I will be a slave for those good people.
      At all times, in all places, and in all conditions
      I will serve him tirelessly with my mind and body.

3973. You made me worship your feet
      and serve your devotees tirelessly,
      O Rāmānuja,who help people to approach
      the feet of the lord of Srirangam.
      I will not look for anything except your compassion
      and you will enable me to reach the lord.

3974. I wandered without good wisdom
      and suffered with the results of bad karma.
      I worshiped the divine name of Ramanuja,
      the virtuous one, generous as a cloud,
      and he made me a slave for those good people
      and made me to understand their matchless teachings.

3975. I do not want to join the people who think
      that if they do dharma, they will become famous
      and reach divine moksha.
      You know that, O Rāmānuja. You are generous as a cloud!
      Through your grace only I will reach your Vaikuṇṭam
      and worship your feet.

3976. I have known Rāmānuja and he knows me.
      When I received his grace and became his slave,
      the results of my bad karma went away,
      and even today I drink his flood of grace.
      I cannot describe all the beautiful things
      that I have received through knowing him.

3977. Devotees wander and suffer without knowledge
      if they do not understand that the lord, the highest light,
      is the inner meaning of the Vedas that are recited.
      Rāmānuja removed their ignorance
      and made them worship the feet of our lord.
      I have no refuge for my dear life
      except the feet of the devotees who worship the feet of the lord.

3978. From now on I will not wander, suffering
      and embracing those who do not love me,
      thinking they are my kin.
      I will consider only that my rulers are the learned ones
      who worship Rāmānuja in their hearts.

3979. Whether people are intelligent or ignorant
      they know Rāmānuja has a good nature and is famous.
      If people are unwise and do not learn the words of Rāmānuja,
      poverty will come to them.

3980. Rāmānuja, strong like a lion,
      learned the musical pasurams
      that are like paddy growing and flourishing in a field.
      I praise him as a tiger in disputing with others
      who know their religious sastras well.

3981. O Rāmānuja, no one can adequately praise your good nature—
      my praise cannot be commensurate with your fame.
      Whatever I do, my mind will not be happy without praising you,
      yet I am afraid that I am unable to praise you enough.
      What more can I do?

3982. The highest lord takes away the future births of his devotees.
      The lord Rāmānuja came to rule me in this world.
      If people do not worship the feet of the garlanded one
      they will be born again and suffer in this world.

3983. The virtuous Rāmānuja spread the fame
      of Rangan of Srirangam who gives grace to all his devotees,
      taking away the darkness of the world.
      He took away the teaching of the Vediyars,
      the scholars of the Agamas, that cause only confusion
      and made the world bright.

3984. I have not done proper nombus,
      or praised you well or worshiped your feet.
      O Rāmānuja of matchless fame,
      praised by good poets who know all the sastras,
      you have entered my heart and my eyes.
      Tell me the reason for this.

3985. Rāmānuja who did true tapas
      never says the errant sastras of other religions are true.
      He removes the results of bad karma for his devotees
      with his grace that is like a shining sword.

3986. Devotion to Rāmānuja will give tapas,
      wealth, good birth, good karma
      and devotion to the highest lord.
      The lives of those who approach him will be sweet like honey.
      My heart is happy, knowing nothing but his fame.

3987. Rāmānuja abides in the hearts of the people of the world
      and gives them whatever they need.
      He, the highest one, loves them and is the music of the world.
      He stays in the sky and gives moksha to all his devotees.
      He was born on the earth, taught the four Vedas
      and spread them.

3988. Rāmānuja, friend of devotees, takes care of those
      who grow old and suffer, lonely and wandering,
      because of the results of their bad karma,
      not knowing how they might obtain good karma.

3989. If they worship his lotus feet,
      Rāmānuja gives his grace to those living
      without any friends and relatives.
      His good nature knows those helpless people
      and he shows compassion to them all.

3990. Those who are born can only reach moksha,
      or go to hell to be born on the earth again and again.
      O mind, if you worship the lord
      he will give you Ramanuja,
      and you will not have any suffering.

3991. The Jains who argue for their beliefs,
      the devil-like Sakkiyars,
      the lazy devotees of Shiva with long matted hair,
      the Sunyavadins who believe in emptiness of the world,
      the learned one of the Vedas
      and low people who make mischief
      could not survive after Ramanuja,
      like a golden Karpaga tree, came into this world.
      They all disappeared.

3992. O Rāmānuja, my heart is a golden bee
      that worships your pure honey-like feet.
      I will not follow any other religion—
      no one can make me to learn their teachings,
      for I want only to drink in the sweet milk of your devotion.

3993. I was caught in my karma
      and born many times on this earth,
      but you have saved me, O Rāmānuja, from the results of my karma.
      Good devotees do not want to follow the doctrines of other religions
      that say following your teachings is wrong.

3994. Suffering with the results of my karma
      I worshiped you, calling out, “O lord, Rāmānuja!”
      and you helped me with your compassion
      in this world surrounded with oceans.
      My hands worship you and my eyes long to see you.

3995. The lord who took the form of an angry lion
      and split open the chest of Hiraṇyan,
      gave Rāmānja to the world whose fame that flourished like a crop in a field.
      As if he were putting a fruit in my hand and giving it to me,
      Rāmānuja gave me good wisdom
      and helped me remove the affliction of my karma.

3996. O Rāmānuja as generous as a rain-giving cloud,
      as if you placed a fruit in my hand and gave it to me,
      you showed me Kaṇṇan.
      I do not want anything except your grace.
      Whether I stay in the deep hole of hell,
      in heaven or in shining moksha,
      I will survive only if you give me your grace.

3997. The lord Māyan who rests on the milky ocean rolling with waves
      stays in the hearts of wise sages and those learned in the Vedas
      who worship the divine feet of Rāmānuja and dance praising him.
      Their place is the same as mine, for I am a slave of the god.

3998. Good devotees say the lord stays in Vaikuṇṭam,
      Venkaṭam and mountainous Thirumalirunjolai.
      Rāmānuja keeps that Māyan in his heart.
      He will enter my heart and give me pleasure.

3999. O lord, divine-natured Rāmānuja,
      even though I may be born in many places,
      suffer with sickness and die,
      I have one thing to ask.
      Make me the slave of your devotees
      and give me your grace so I will love them.

4000. O heart flourishing with devotion,
      let us praise Lakshmi, seated on the chest of the lord of southern Srirangam
      surrounded with fields where beautiful fish frolic.
      Let me worship the lord
      so I may approach the feet of illustrious Ramanuja.
