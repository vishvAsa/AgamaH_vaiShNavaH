+++
2282. I saw today the divine form of the ocean-colored lord,
      his golden body adorned with jewels
      that shone with the color of the bright sun
      and the golden discus in his hands that fights in war
      and the sounding curving conch.

2283. Today I saw his ankleted feet
      and now I will not be born again for seven births.
      O Thirumāl with a mountain-like golden chest ,
      You are adorned with a cool thulasi garland,
      and you embrace your beloved Lakshmi from the milky ocean.
      I find you with love in my heart.

2284. The ocean-colored lord stays in my mind
      who, angry at his enemies on the battlefield,
      fought with them and killed them.
      His chest is adorned with thulasi garlands,
      and he rests on a snake bed on the wide ocean and embraces Lakshmi.
      He is the remedy that will save me from going to hell.

2285. The feet of the lovely-eyed lord
      who swallowed all the seven worlds and spat them out,
      measured the earth and the sky
      and received a boon from Mahābali for three feet of land
      are wealth, nectar and remedy for all.

2286. The feet of the lord with a discus
      who measured the world are lotus-colored,
      his body has the color of the ocean that surrounds the world
      and the brightness of his crown is like the sun on its chariot.
      All these things make him beautiful.

2287. It is lovely to see his ocean-colored body,
      it is lovely to see him cross the world with his feet,
      it is lovely to see Nānmuhan who stays on a lotus
      and brought the Ganges to wash the feet of Thirumāl
      after the lord took water in his hand
      to get three feet of land from Mahābali
      so that he could measure the earth and the sky.

2288. O heart, come, let us worship the feet of the lord
      who measured the world surrounded with dark ocean.
      He rides on Garuḍa and flies around the groves.
      He is hard for anyone to understand
      and he is inapproachable for all.

2289. O good heart,
      let us worship him folding our hands
      and recite his many names,
      praising him and saying, “ Nārāyaṇā!”
      May our eyes see only Kaṇṇan,
      adorned with a cool thulasi garland swarming with bees
      who swallowed all the worlds and spat them out.

2290. His eyes and hands are like lovely lotuses
      and he has beautiful lotus feet that measured the world.
      The shining body of the lord has the color of a cloud,
      the ocean and a precious sapphire.

2291. If people praise the brightness, strength,
      beauty, form, faultless family and all other things of the lord
      with a beautiful white conch in his right hand
      and if they recite his names, all goodness will come to them.

2292. He is in the four Vedas that are recited by all
      and he has the color of a waterfall descending quickly
      and filled with honey.
      He carries a sounding conch in his hands
      and rests on the snake bed Adisesha on the milky ocean.
      He is the knowledge of the learned ones
      of the ocean of sastras.

2293. Devotees who cultivate knowledge,
      recite the Vedas well, control and close the door
      to the feelings of five senses
      and meditate on the beautiful ocean-colored lord
      will see his nature every day in the world.

2294. In ancient times
      when Thirumāl went to Mahābali’s sacrifice as a dwarf,
      took water in his hands and asked for three feet of land
      and received it,
      he grew tall and measured the world
      and his crown split the sky.

2295. If devotees who have given up the desire to embrace women
      learn the sastras and put their minds on the lord of Thiruvenkaṭam
      praised by all the four Vedas
      and worshiped in the sky by the gods
      whose crowns touch the feet of the lord,
      they will reach him easily.

2296. Our father, resting on the ocean rolling with waves
      on Adisesha whose head bears jewels,
      came and stays in my heart
      and I became his slave.

2297. My father shining like a beautiful lamp
      of red corals and precious pearls
      born in the ocean rolling with white waves
      stays in Thiruvallikkeṇi
      embracing vine-like Lakshmi’s chest.

2298. All the days I have lived in the past,
      and the days I live in the present and the future
      are good days if I constantly praise the lovely-eyed Thirumāl.
      May my mouth praise him.

2299. O Neḍumāl,
      you went to Mahābali’s sacrifice as a dwarf,
      asked for three feet of land, received it,
      and grew to the sky and measured the earth and the sky.
      Give me your grace so that all of my fears will go away
      and I will be a slave to your feet in all my seven births.

2300. He was born as a child and slept on the banyan leaf
      at the end of the eon, and gave his grace
      to his devotees who, without any faults in their minds,
      sprinkled fresh flowers on his feet,
      folded their hands, stood before him and worshiped him.
      How could not give his grace to his devotees now?

2301. O Thirumāl, you, the tall god with beautiful eyes,
      swallowed all the worlds and spat them out in ancient times.
      How could it have been difficult for you to measure
      the earth and the sky with your two feet at Mahabali’s sacrifice?
      O divine lord? Tell us all about it.

2302. When the Asuran Vakkaran came to fight with our lord,
      who is adorned with a fragrant thulasi garland
      and carries a shining discus in his right hand
      and a conch in his left, he killed the Asuran.
      He will present himself in whatever form
      people wish to think he has.

2303. O heart, the beautiful gods in the sky adorned with crowns
      sprinkle fragrant flowers on his feet and worship him,
      and you, O devotees, should worship the lord the same good way
      following the sastras, and with your hearts melting.

2304. I worship his feet ornamented with golden anklets,
      my mind enthralled with the lord
      adorned with a thulasi garland swarming with lovely-winged bees
      that make buds bloom when they blow on them.

2305. O heart, worship every day the ankleted feet
      of the lord with a beautiful shining discus in his hand.
      He is the blowing wind, the wide earth,
      the sky where clouds float, strong fire and the ocean.

2306. O, heart, there is nothing wrong if you worship the lord
      who swallowed all the earth and kept it in his stomach,
      ate butter that lovely-haired Yasodha churned and kept,
      conquered the seven bulls for Nappinnai,
      and is praised by all the gods in the sky.

2307. The lord, adorned with a cool thulasi garland
      and resting on beautiful-eyed Adisesha,
      stays in my devoted heart
      and in famous Kachi, Thiruvenkaṭam, Thiruvekkaa, and Thiruveḷukkaippāḍi.

2308. How could they have any troubles
      if his devotees reach and worship the dark ocean-colored lord,
      the origin of everything, who churned the milky ocean
      and rests on the sea on Adisesha?

2309. The highest lord, our father resting on the snake bed,
      drank milk from the breasts of the devil Putana,
      fought the Bharatha war to help the five Pandavas,
      and was spanked with a churning stick
      by the cowherdess Yasodha when he stole the butter.

2310. Without being afraid the cowherdess Yasodha
      took and embraced dark-colored Kaṇṇan
      and fed him milk after he had drunk the milk of the devil Putana
      as a beautiful baby prattling with his sweet coral mouth.

2311. Thirumāl adorned with a thulasi garland
      and resting on Adisesha on the ocean
      stays in Kudanthai surrounded by the sea,
      in Thiruvenkaṭam, in my pure mind, in the divine sky, in Iṛaipāḍi
      and in beautiful Pāḍaham where Vediyars recite the Vedas.

2312. The lord who stays on the milky ocean
      on the earless serpent Adisesha worshiped by all the four Vedas
      and took the form of a man-lion and split open the chest of Hiraṇyan.
      He shares his body with Shiva adorned with a snake in whose hair the Ganges flows.

2313. Gopalan who broke the Kurundam trees and killed the Asurans
      abides on Adisesha on the milky ocean, in Thiruvenkaṭam,
      the cool sky, all the sastras, the mind of Lakshmi,
      the hearts of the sages plunged in yoga
      and in my heart.

2314. O Thirumāl, it is true
      that you swallowed all the seven worlds
      at the end of the eon,
      lay on a banyan leaf as a baby,
      churned the milky ocean with Mandara mountain
      and gave the nectar to all the gods in the sky.

2315. O heart, see!
      The faultless lord who killed the Asuran Kamsan
      stands in Thiruvezhukkai,
      and recline- on Adisesha on the ocean.
      Is he exhausted because he measured the world
      at Mahābali’s sacrifice?

2316. My eyes say, “I want to see him, I want to see him!”
      Folding our hands, we sing his praise
      and worship the shining golden feet
      of the god resting on the ocean
      whose golden body is adorned with rich shining ornaments
      and a thulasi garland swarming with bees that sing.

2317. The dark ocean-colored Māyan
      who measured the world and the sky
      with his two feet and rests on the cool ocean
      carries a fiery discus in one hand,
      and a white conch in the other,
      and a heroic club, a bow and a shining sword.

2318. I became the slave of the lord colored like the rolling ocean
      who is inside and outside of all,
      with shining jewels
      and coral-mouthed Lakshmi on his divine chest.

2319. Even though all forms in the world are his forms,
      he can be compared only to himself.
      Our lord, the Māyan whose form is tapas
      is all the stars, burning fire, the eight directions, tall hills
      and the shining sun and moon in the sky.

2320. Our lord is in the hearts of all
      who is the earth, the eight directions,
      the Vedas, the meaning of the Vedas,
      the sky, and the god of the Thiruvekaṭam hills
      where pure waterfalls descend with a lovely sound.

2321. O heart, the faultless lord,
      the king who measured the world,
      is in the hearts of all his devotees
      and in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills
      with peaks that touch the sky
      and waterfalls flowing with abundant water.

2322. When the lord who carried Govardhana mountain
      as an umbrella to protect the cows and the cowherds
      measured the world,
      his diamond-studded crown touched the sky,
      his hands extended in all the eight directions,
      his ankleted feet encircled all the thick groves of the earth
      and his dress shone like lightning.

2323. The sapphire-colored Kaṇnan who grazed the cows
      and played the flute killed the Asuran when it came in the form of a horse.
      When the lord was angry at Hiraṇyan, he took the form of a man-lion
      and split open his chest with his sharp claws.

2324. The lord who embraces the earth goddess on his chest
      and fought with the angry elephant Kuvalayaabeeḍam
      and broke its tusks
      swallowed all worlds into his stomach.

2325. He is the world, the eon, the ocean
      the shining sun and moon and red fire.
      O heart, worship the feet of the lord happily,
      whose pure golden crown shines with bright rays.

2326. Thiruvenkaṭam where a strong bull elephant
      fights lovingly with his mate
      and wanders angrily, spilling pearls from its white ivory tusks
      is the hill of the lord
      who swallowed all the earth in ancient times.

2327. When the lord churned the milky ocean
      using Mandara mountain as a churning stick
      and the snake Vasuki as the rope,
      pulling the rope with the gods on one side
      and the Asurans on the other,
      the water rose up and touched the sky.

2328. O lord with beautiful eyes,
      when Mahābali promised to give you three feet of land
      you took it and grew tall and measured the whole earth and the sky.
      Adorned with a thulasi garland,
      you split open the mouth of Kesa when he came as a horse.
      You close the door of hell and save us so we do not enter it.

2329. Didn’t you make Mahābali pour water on your hands
      and promise to give you three feet of land
      when you went to him as a dwarf
      and measured the world and the sky with your two feet?
      Didn’t you graze the cows?
      Didn’t you split open the mouth of the horse?
      And didn’t you go between the marudu trees and fight with Devasuran?

2330. With curved conch in your hands,
      you fought with your enemy Hiraṇyan and killed him,
      you asked for three feet of land from Mahābali
      took over the earth and the sky,
      and you fought with seven bulls
      to marry Nappinnai.

2331. O Thirumāl, when the elephant Gajendra
      was caught by a cruel crocodile in a spring filled with beautiful water,
      you, the beautiful dark-colored Kaṇṇan
      adorned with a shining jewel-studded crown and thulasi garlands,
      killed the crocodile and saved the elephant.

2332. He protected the cows and the cowherds
      with Govardhana mountain when there was a big storm
      and broke the marudam trees when Asurans came as those trees.
      As Rama, he fought the Raksasas and burned Lanka.
      He will give you moksha, the divine place where there is no sorrow.

2333. The lord shot his arrows and destroyed the seven marā trees,
      and he took the form of a dwarf, went to Mahābali and took over the sky and the earth.
      When Ravana, the king of Lanka took Sita, ornamented with beautiful jewels,
      our lord, as Rama, went to southern Lanka. fought with Ravana and killed him
      and brought his wife back.

2334. The lord who slept on a banyan leaf on the ocean
      as a magic child at the end of the eon
      swallowed the earth and the flood of water.
      O heart, worship the feet of him
      adorned with a cool thulasi garland.

2335. The lord kicked Sakaṭasuran when he came as a cart,
      went between the Marudu trees when the Asurans came as those trees,
      breaking them and killing them,
      and he took the form of a boar, split open the earth,
      brought up the earth goddess and loved her.
      The love that he has for Lakshmi
      whom he embraces on his chest
      is more than the love that he has for the earth goddess.

2336. The lord with lovely long eyes
      like lotuses swarming with singing bees
      wears many jewels on his large mountain-like chest
      so it looks like a dark cloud glittering with lightning.

2337. We do not know
      whether our god’s color is white, red, green or black.
      If one thinks about it only Saraswathi, the goddess of art,
      could equal the beauty of the god
      who is the beloved of Lakshmi.

2338. With beautiful Lakshmi on his chest
      he is like lightning shining in the dark sky.
      People should understand that worshiping the feet of the dark god
      who rides on Garuḍa is the only devotion they need.

2339. Know that the god who asked for three feet of land from Mahābali
      and took over the world and sky with his cleverness
      stays happily in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills
      where a female monkey tells her mate sitting on a small hill,
      “Catch the white moon and give it to me.”

2340. I found the way to survive
      worshiping the feet of the dear lovely-eyed sapphire-colored lord
      adorned with long thulasi garlands that make him look
      like a dark mountain on which a waterfall flows.

2341. Our god blew his conch and conquered his enemies on all battlefields,
      protected the cows from the storm with Govardhana mountain,
      went between the Marudam trees and destroyed them,
      broke the cart when Sakaṭasuran came in that form,
      drank the milk of the devil Putana
      and threw the calf at the vilam tree and killed the Asurans.

2342. Just as Thiruvenkaṭam, the milky ocean and Vaikuṇṭam
      are ancient temples where the lord stays,
      now Thirukkaḍigai surrounded with flourishing groves
      swarming with bees is the divine heavenly place of the young lord.

2343. The lord who took three feet of land from Mahābali and measured the world
      after receiving a promise from him with water poured on his hands
      stays in Thiruviṇṇagaram, in Thiruvekka surrounded by ocean with rolling waves,
      in Thiruvenkaṭam, in Maṇṇakaram, in Thiruveḷukkai filled with beautiful palaces,
      in Thirukkuḍanthai in the south,
      in sweet Thiruvarangam surrounded with groves dripping with honey
      and in southern Thirukkoṭṭiyur.

2344. My father, the god of Thirumalai
      where waterfalls flow with abundant water
      has only one form that combines
      Shiva with his long jaṭa, shining golden mazu,
      and a snake around his neck
      and our Thirumāl with a tall crown, a discus, and golden thread.

2345. Using the snake Vasuki as a rope
      and Mandara mountain as a churning stick
      he churned the milky ocean,
      took nectar from it and gave it to the gods.
      Is he so tired because of that
      that he reclines in Thiruvekka, sits in Kānji
      and stands in Thiruvaragam?

2346. Our father who broke the tusks of the elephant
      Kuvalayābeeḍam and killed it
      went as a man-lion in the evening
      and angrily split open the chest of Hiraṇyan
      and protected Prahaladan, the son of Hiraṇyan.

2347. The Asurans Madhu and Kaiḍava
      were destroyed when Adisesha with jewels on his head
      merely breathed on them.
      If anyone becomes the enemy of the god
      and their end will be like that of Madhu and Kaibadava.

2348. The lovely lotus on the navel of the lord
      thinks that the shining discus in his right hand is the sun
      and the white conch in his left is the moon
      and, confused, opens and closes at the same time.

2349. The lord who threw the calf at the Vilam tree
      and destroyed the Asurans
      stays in Thiruvenkaṭam hills where a monkey
      that plucks a fruit from a vilam tree,
      sees his own shadow in the water of a spring,
      thinks another monkey has his fruit
      and extends his hands and asks the shadow monkey to give it.

2350. Her mother says,
      “My daughter sings the praise of Thiruvenkaṭam
      whenever she thinks of any hills.
      She wears thulasi on her dark hair thinking
      that is the best thing for a chaste women to wear
      and she goes to bathe in the large ocean every morning
      thinking that it is the milky ocean
      where broad-armed Thirumāl rests."

2351. The elephant in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills
      who washes his teeth with his ichor,
      washes his hands and legs with the water from the waterfalls,
      and carries blooming flowers that drip honey
      goes, sees and worships the heroic lord of Thiruvenkaṭam.

2352. The lord who threw a calf at the vilam tree and killed the Asurans
      stays in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills
      where an elephant, thinking that a cloud is an enemy elephant,
      runs and tries to fight it and a yāḷi, seeing the elephant,
      screams in anger and kills the elephant
      as the sound echoes through the hills.

2353. Our young lord stays in Thiruvenkaṭam hill
      where the bamboo sticks that gypsy girls
      with round bangles throw as they play, rise up to the sky
      and release the shining moon from its curse.

2354. It is the best thing for our tongues to praise him
      who drove a chariot yoked to seven horses and danced on a pot.
      To worship the feet ornamented with sounding anklets
      of the god of Thiruvenkaṭam is a good thing for us.

2355. He drank the milk of the breasts of cruel devil Putana
      and made her fall to the ground,
      but the cowherdess Yasodha took him on her lap
      and fed him milk, keeping him at her breasts.
      Isn't her love beautiful?

2356. In the divine Thiruvenkaṭam hills
      where the blossoms of vengai tree spread their fragrance,
      an angry tiger sees the rabbit in the floating white moon
      against the red color of the sky, thinks it is a real rabbit
      and becomes angry because it could not catch it.
-
2357. You do not need to stand on a hill,
      plunge into water or stand near five sacrificial fires to reach him.
      If you sprinkle flowers, folding your hands,
      and lovingly worship the god of Thiruvekka,
      all your bad karma will disappear.

2358.The Raksasa Rāvaṇa who slept on the lap of Nānmuhan as a baby
and received boons from him, his grandfather,
carried a shining sword and fought with Rama,
and Rama cut off all his ten crowned heads
and made them all fall on the earth.
Rama's lotus feet are the refuge of us, his devotees.

2359. We should not think, “Where is our refuge?
      Where can we go? Are we going to be born again and again?”
      Praise and worship the heroic lord
      who destroyed the strength of his enemies with his discus—
      he is our only refuge.

2360. If devotees control their five senses
      and keep in their minds
      only the dark ocean-colored lord
      with a fragrant thulasi garland on his chest
      they will not be born again.

2361. My heart tries to approach the divine feet of the lord
      resting on the snake Adisesha
      with a shining discus that conquers all
      and who fought with Vānāsuran, riding on a jeweled chariot
      and cut off his thousand arms.

2362. O my firm heart, even though it is difficult to think of him,
      think and praise him without worrying.
      He is in you and will not move from there.
      Why are you unable to know him.?
      Why do you do not feel him?

2363. If you want to be aware of him it is hard
      and it is impossible for you to see him
      even if he enters your heart.
      Where can I go to see the lord, the king
      adorned with a cool thulasi garland swarming with bees
      and dripping with honey?

2364. Even though people praise Māyan saying
      that he is sweet, no one can see him,
      yet the sweet ankleted lord, stays inside your heart
      who became a dwarf, went like a thief
      and measured the earth and the sky at Mahābali’s sacrifice.

2365. People think of him and say,
      “He is the meaning of the four Vedas
      and he is in our hearts and we feel him,”
      but who has seen the cool lotus-eyed Māyavan?
      How could one describe him in their poems?

2366. In their poetry, poets worship the lord,
      describing the beauty of his form,
      and the devotees hear them
      and come to worship him in all his temples.
      Even if the poets and the people of the world praise the beauty of the lord
      who conquered the seven bulls to marry Nappinnai,
      will their words be enough to praise his divine shining beauty?

2367. Beautiful clouds that flash with lightning,
      roaring with thunder, show the color of dear Neḍumāl,
      and the dark sky where clouds float together
      looks like his dark color also.

2368. O lord ornamented with shining jewels
      and a cool thulasi garland strung with bunches of flowers
      that swarm with bees,
      your body blooms like a flower and shines like an emerald,
      and the evening sky has your color.

2369. Worship the golden ankleted feet of the lord
      who is adorned with a cool thulasi garland dripping with honey.
      If you do not have doubts, saying, “This is good, this is bad.”
      you will not collect more karma in future
      and your past karma will go away.

2370. The lord who plays sweet music on his flute
      is the god of Thiruvenkaṭam
      where gypsies plant millet seeds in the fields
      that grow along with bamboo that rises and touches the sky.

2371. When Thirumāl, adorned with a beautiful thulasi garland,
      grew tall and touched the rivers in the sky with his divine foot
      at the sacrifice of Mahābali as his silambu and his anklets rattled,
      his eight arms hurt as they extended in eight directions
      because the space of the whole earth was not enough for them.

2372. The young lord swallowed the earth at the end of the eon,
      drank poisonous milk from the breasts of the devil Putanā,
      and when Yasodha the cowherdess tied him with a rope
      because he stole butter, even though it hurt him
      he did not get upset and kept quiet.

2373. O heart, worship the ankleted feet of the dark-colored Māyan,
      the unborn, divine one who was raised by Nandan, the chief of the cowherds.
      As Kaṇṇan he fought with Vānāsuran when Anurudhan took Usha
      and cut off his thousand arms.

2374. Thirumāl swallowed all the worlds,
      kept them in his stomach at the end of the eon
      and slept on a banyan leaf as a baby on the flood.
      Who knows what will happen to this world?
      O heart! Keep the lord inside you.

2375. I light the lamp of knowing and feel him
      in my heart and keep him there.
      The Māyan, standing, sitting and lying in different temples,
      entered my heart and stays there always.

2376. O heart, worship his divine feet and praise Thirumāl
      who went to Hiraṇyan in the evening as a man-lion
      and split open his chest with his sharp claws
      as his blood flew all over.

2377. As the gods in the sky bow to him
      their jewel-studded crowns
      mark the lotus feet
      of the beloved of Lakshmi.

2378. Could the gods
      Nānmuhan who stays on a lotus on his navel,
      Shiva with long matted hair,
      and Indra, colored like a kānji flower,
      ever be able to think of him in their hearts even for a moment?

2379. The lord who is the snow-covered mountains,
      the wide sky, the wind and light
      killed the Asuran Kesi when he came as a horse and protected us.
      He will save us from Yama when he comes to take us.

2380. Our refuge is the feet of the god of Aṭṭapuyaharam
      who fought and conquered all his enemies
      and killed the murderous crocodile with his discus
      when it caught the elephant Gajendra.

2381. The dark cloud-colored lord with a discus is always our refuge.
      Our lord with a tulasi garland on his mountain-like chest
      has lovely lotus eyes that shine like lightning in a dark cloud
      as he embraces Lakshmi who is on a flower dripping with honey.
