title = "14 Second Thiruvanthaathi Buthaththāzhvar (2182 -2281)"

+++

2182. My love for him is a lamp,
      the oil in the lamp is my desire to worship him,
      and the wick is my sweet mind that melts for him.
      I light the shining lamp with my wisdom.
      I composed this Thiruvandāthi for Naraṇan
      in divine Tamil.

2183. If you stay in a good place
      and recite the names of Nāraṇan,
      understanding him well with your wisdom,
      the nature of the king of the gods is to give you
      the privilege of being a god among the gods in the sky.

2184. If devotees worship sprinkling fragrant flowers
      on the feet of the god resting on the milky ocean,
      they will enter the shining world of the ancient god of the gods
      where only the gods in the sky can enter.

2185. I string garlands with jewels, pearls,
      diamonds and fresh flowers,
      carry matchless beautiful lotuses, and worship the feet
      of him on whose chest Lakshmi seated on a lotus
      on the right side of his body.

2186. You asked for three feet of land as a boon
      from Mahābali at his sacrifice
      and measured the world and the sky with your two feet.
      O Neḍumal, you are colored like the ocean rolling with waves!
      Who is able to know the power of your feet and speak of it?

2187. If good-hearted devotees control their five senses,
      do much tapas with love, sprinkle fresh flowers
      and worship him reciting his names
      they will see the ankleted feet of the ocean-colored god.

2188. When he raised his ankleted feet
      and fought with his enemies Namusi and others
      with his heroic discus,
      he scared them and made their minds burn.
      O heart, worship happily his divine golden lotus feet.

2189. When Putana took you in her lap
      and gave milk from her beautiful breast saying, “Drink happily,”
      you pretended to drink her milk and killed her.
      Even though she came as a mother and gave milk to you,
      you killed her because she had come to kill you.

2190. Yashoda was not worried about giving you milk
      from her breasts with love
      even though she saw how you killed
      Putana when she came and fed you milk.
      Is even this ocean-encircled earth that you measured
      equal to the love of that cowherd mother?

2191. O lord, I think always of you
      who kicked and killed Sakaṭasuran
      when he came as a large cart
      and protected the world.
      You asked for three feet of land from Mahābali
      and took over the whole earth and saved its people.
      I worship you with my tongue,
      sprinkling flowers on your feet.
      The results of my karma are gone.

2192. Many people worship the feet of other gods
      and enjoy life only for a short time,
      but they do not worship you to attain eternal moksha.
      O Neḍumal with the color of the ocean rolling with waves,
      who can describe the might of your feet?

2193. If any of his devotes worship him will reach
      the feet of him resting on the snake bed.
      He treats everyone equally.
      Even the bright sun that goes around the world,
      Nānmuhan on a lotus
      and Shiva with a forehead eye
      worship the lord every day without ceasing.

2194. When the large elephant Gajendra
      went to the pond to pick up a beautiful lotus flower to worship him
      he was caught by a crocodile,
      and the lord came and saved him, killing the crocodile.
      Wasn’t Gajendra saved and so he could reach the world of Indra,
      because he worshipped the feet of the lord with a discus?

2195. O ignorant ones, do not praise the people
      of the world who perform many evil deeds
      increasing their karma.
      Recite the names of the lord who grew to the sky
      and whose hands were extended in all the eight directions.
      Wander as sages and go to all the temples
      where he stays, worship him and become faultless.

2196. Are these the things the lord enjoys—
      driving the chariot in the terrible battle for Arjuna,
      -chasing Marisan to catch him when he came as a golden deer,
      losing Sita when she was kidnapped by Rāvaṇa
      and resting on the beautiful snake bed Adisesha on the ocean?

2197. When he enters someone’s heart
      and a devotee locks him in it,
      the lord may not know that he is imprisoned in the devotee’s heart.
      If someone does not dig out a pond on a mound in a forest
      and save the rain water, there will be no water to flow and nourish the fields.
      Lock him in your heart.

2198. Indra, the king of the gods, and Nānmuhan on a lotus
      worshiped him and asked him to help them when they were in trouble.
      Like them, Shiva with thick matted hair adorned with the crescent moon
      went to Thirumāl, asked for his aid and received his grace
      when the skull of Nānmuhan was stuck to his hand.
      Who but our lord could have helped them all?

2199. Thirumāl took the form of a dwarf
      went to Mahābali’s sacrifice, grew tall
      and measured the earth and the sky,
      he took the form of a man-lion
      split open the chest of Hiraṇyan with his claws,
      and he swallowed all the seven worlds in the eon.
      Did Thirumāl with beautiful eyes do these things to save the world?

2200. When Sakaṭasuran came as a cart, you kicked it and killed him,
      but that is not all you did.
      You also threw the calf on the vilam tree and killed the two Asurans.
      The world may blame you for breaking a cart or throwing a small calf,
      but you only did these things to protect the world.

2201. If your devotees do not sin or do bad deeds,
      and only praise you
      because they recite your name Narayaṇā without mistake
      and understand your power, worshiping only you,
      they will live happily.

2202. Our lord, the beloved of Lakshmi, abides in the hearts of those devotees
      who always think of him and worship him.
      They have the good fortune of bowing to the feet of the lord
      who took the form of a dwarf
      and they will never go to cruel hell.

2203. Didn’t the dark Gajendra, the large elephant with white tusks,
      worship him with beautiful flowers and get what he wanted?
      If someone wants to achieve something,
      it will be easy for him if he truly tries like Gajendra.

2204. The lord who threw the calf onto the vilam tree
      and killed the two Asurans,
      went to Mahābali's sacrifice in the form of a dwarf,
      grew tall and measured the world and the sky with his two feet.
      If devotees worship him and live following good paths,
      he will give them a good life.

2205. O good heart, he is happiness and sorrow in life.
      He is the five senses and he is the wind, fire, water, sky,
      the dark mountains, the ocean with waves and burning fire.
      He is everything.

2206. He, famed since ancient times, the creator of the Vedas,
      praised by the gods in the sky,
      went to Lanka angrily, fought with the Raksasas
      and killed their king Rāvaṇa.
      He has come to stay in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills
      where bamboo plants grow on the cool slopes.

2207. He rests on Adishesa on the ocean,
      and in the Venkaṭam hills where his devotees
      who have controlled their five senses,
      their feelings and their minds come and worship him.
      He gave the hills to the gods
      so that they can come, live there and worship him.

2208. My mind searches for Thirumāl CHECK
      the god of Thiruvenkaṭam hills,
      like a vine climbing on the wall
      that grows towards the sky
      looking for a stick to support it.

2209. The ocean-colored lord
      stays in Thiruvenkaṭam and in Thiruvarangam,
      a place that is hard to conceive.
      He split the mouth of Kesi when he came as a horse
      and he is praised by all as the god of the gods, abiding in the hearts of all.

2210. You shot your arrows and destroyed southern Lanka.
      You killed Putana when she came as a mother
      to give you milk from her breasts.
      Yet even though your mother Yashoda saw all these heroic deeds
      she was not afraid to give you her milk.

2211. People say, “O ocean-colored Thirumāl!
      You measured the world at Mahābali’s sacrifice,
      became a boar and split open the earth
      to bring the earth goddess up from the underworld,
      churned the wide milky ocean, took nectar and gave it to the gods,
      and made a bridge on the ocean
      and went to Lanka to fight the Raksasas.”

2212. If the devotees go every day in the morning taking fresh flowers
      and worship the feet of the beautiful lord
      who took the form of a beautiful boar
      to bring back the earth goddess from the underworld,
      they will see the lord’s shining form and be happy.

2213. O Thirumāl, my heart is happy
      seeing you and worshiping your feet.
      I am happy to sing and dance,
      and your conch and fiery discus are happy seeing me
      when I worship you.

2214. When I bow to the feet of the lord
      adorned with many thulasi garlands,
      my heart feels happy.
      I praise the heroic one with my tongue
      the god of the Thiruvenkaṭam hills
      where bamboo grows on the slopes.

2215. As a dwarf you asked for three feet of land from Mahābali
      and when he gave it, you measured the world and the sky with your feet.
      I worshiped you lovingly with fragrant smoke and fresh flowers
      and became your slave. This is my good fortune.

2216. People say passion is sweet but water is sweeter.
      O father, if people do not want passion or water
      and only listen to your heroism
      that will be the water that protects them.

2217. Mean people can achieve fame only by doing mean deeds.
      They know nothing.
      O my heart, worship our Māyan
      who swallowed the earth and spat it out
      and be calm.

2218. You created the four-headed god,
      the creator of the Vedas
      who stays on a beautiful lotus on your navel.
      If we do not praise your divine feet and bow to you
      we will have only trouble in all our births.

2219. Do not think you have much wealth
      and depend on it to make your life without trouble.
      You should think Mādhavan is yours and keep him in your heart.
      Reciting his names with your tongue is just like reciting the Vedas.

2220. O ignorant people,
      know how to praise the names of the good lord.
      That is what the Vedas say.
      If you follow what you have learned from the sastras that is good.
      If you cannot do that,
      just say the names of Mādhavan—
      that is really the meaning of the Vedas.

2221. Before Yama comes and throws his rope and catches you,
      think of the names of the lord.
      You know that real happiness is to worship the feet of the lord
      with Lakshmi on his chest.
      There is no other thing could bring you happiness
      except to know the lord and worship his feet.

2222. No one can enter the world of the gods just by wealth.
      The only way to attain moksha is by his grace.
      O heart, don't forget his sapphire-colored feet
      that give moksha to divine sages.
      Always meditate on his names.

2223. I think of Thirumāl always.
      If devotees worship and meditate on the wide arms of the lord,
      they will not have any future births.
      Just by worshiping him
      the sages get all the happiness
      that those receive who were born
      to enjoy family life in this world.

2224. He shot his arrows and cut off
      all the twenty arms, ten heads and two feet
      of Rāvaṇa and killed him.
      The only good use of my arms is to worship
      the feet of the devotees who worship his feet.

2225. For good devotees,
      the names of beautiful-eyed Thirumāl are a true help.
      I will not consider those who forget him as human beings.
      Keep in your mind the name Mādhavan,
      the god of dharma, and recite his names—
      that is the only good thing that you should do.

2226. The lord of Thiruvenkaṭam
      worshiped by the gods in the sky
      is himself the Vedas
      whose meanings are endless.
      If devotees worship his feet
      they will have no pride whether they are rich or poor.

2227. The generous sapphire-colored lord
      stays in Srirangam, Thirukkoṭṭiyur
      and in his favorite place, Thiruvenkaṭam.
      He is lord of beautiful Thirumālirunjolai
      and Thiruneermalai flourishing with abundant water.

2228. Folding your hands with devotion in your heart,
      worship him in the morning when you get up
      and sprinkle flowers on the feet of him -
      who took the form of a man-lion and fought with Hiraṇyan,
      -measured the world at Mahābali’s sacrifice,
      -swallowed the world and spat it out
      and split open the earth to bring the earth goddess from the underworld.

2229. O Thirumāl, you taught the sages all the four Vedas
      and the sastras that teach morals.
      Embracing Lakshmi on a lotus on your chest,
      you stay happily on the beautiful Thirumālirunjolai
      surrounded with beautiful large groves on its slopes
      where bamboos grow.

2230. O my heart! Praise him and call to him without fear, saying ,
      “You drank the poisonous milk from the breasts of Putana
      as the seven mountains, seven worlds and the seven sounding oceans
      were all shaken.”

2231. I will call Thirumāl with his faultless names saying,
      “You are the cowherd adorned with precious ornaments,
      the Yādavan, the Māyavan, loved by all.”
      In front of everyone I am calling Mādhavan with love
      in the same way all the cowherds call him.

2232. O heart,
      Think of the feet of the lord who has the sapphire color of the ocean
      and recite his wonderful names.
      Worship the feet of him who churned the milky ocean
      and gave nectar to the gods

2233. The dark-colored one
      with Lakshmi on a beautiful lotus on his chest
      is the lord of dharma.
      He sent the evil king Rāvaṇa
      who fought valiantly with his sword
      to the world of Indra, the king of the gods in the sky.
      Who knows how he gives his grace?

2234. I would go and worship the lord in Thiruvenkaṭam hills
      where the blooming creepers think
      that the thick hair of women
      falling low on their backs
      are small hills and cling on to it to grow.

2235. O lord, you wish to stay
      in the Venkaṭam and Thirumālirunjolai hills
      surrounded with thick groves.
      Like those hills, I make my heart your temple,
      worship you and say,
      "Do not leave my heart, for it is your young temple
      and it is like the milky ocean for you.”

2236. You are wise and carry a heroic discus.
      In all my seven births I have never forgotten you—
      and I have been mindful of you.
      Give me your grace so I may plunge into the ocean of joy.

2237. If one gazes at the grass growing on the shore of the ocean
      and tells it to be shy, will it become shy?
      (Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth, shows her golden body
      before our Thirumāl shows his dark body to us.)
      OR Lakshmi shows the dark body of Thirumāl to us
      before Thirumāl shows his body to us.

2238. Praise him with your tongue
      who embraces Lakshmi on his chest
      and gives his grace to all.
      Have you heard? Devotees from all the directions
      praise the name of our lord and worship his feet,
      because it is our right to praise him.

2239. Because of my good karma,
      Saraswathi stays in my good heart
      and has taught me what to do.
      She gives her grace and tells me,
      “Just as margosa, even though it is bitter, gives good health,
      the golden discus which the lord carries to fight his enemies
      is only to only protect the world and the gods.
      Praise his golden discus!”

2240. I worship his devotees with my good heart
      and no longer do wrong.
      My evil thoughts have gone away
      and I think only of his beautiful lotus feet,
      meditate on him and worship him.

2241. You do not have only one form.
      A shining form is yours,
      and the vast world says you have two forms.
      See, if devotees know your ancient form
      they will rule the world with justice.

2242. People say that as a thief
      you took the form of a bachelor dwarf,
      went to king Mahābali and asked for three feet of land.
      You measured the world with one of your feet
      and raised the other foot and touched the sky,
      as your arms extended to all directions.
      How fortunate they are who described you like this!

2243. I did not have the fortune of worshiping you,
      and I did not receive your grace because I was not wise.
      I only praised and worshiped you saying things which are not true.
      O, bull of the cowherds! You broke the horns of the seven bulls
      and conquered them to marry Nappinnai.

2244. If I were to describe how our father
      conquered the seven bulls to marry Nappinnai
      and how he poured his blood into Nānmuhan’s skull
      that was stuck to Shiva’s hands and made it fall,
      they would be long stories.

2245. O Kaṇṇa, all the stories that anyone tells,
      no matter what they are about,
      are only about you and nothing else.
      My heart wants to praise you.
      You are the stories and the divine words in them.
      Give me your grace so I may understand your stories.

2246. I worship your divine body,
      I bow to your beautiful lotus feet with love
      and I worship you folding my hands.
      I searched for you, my refuge,
      and know that the best life for me
      is to praise and live where you are.

2247. See, O good heart,
      this birth is what has happened to us.
      If we praise the names of Nārāyaṇan
      resting on the ocean on a snake bed,
      that will be the way to avoid going to hell.

2248. I saw his divine body in a dream,
      his hands and the fiery discus that he carries
      and found that he is the strength
      that will remove the results
      of my good and bad karma
      and the troubles of my life.

2249. He, the king broke the tusks of the elephant Kuvalayaabeeḍam,
      used big Mandara mountain as a churning stick
      and the enormous snake Vasuki as a rope, churned the milky ocean,
      and gave the nectar to the gods,
      cheating the strong Asurans with sharp teeth.

2250. Even the kings of famous countries
      who ride horses have been devotees
      of the lord for their seven births.
      on whose navel Nānmuhan abides on a lotus,

2251. The places of our heroic lord,
      skilled in shooting arrows and conquering his enemies,
      are the hearts of his devotees,
      divine Srirangam, the cool milky ocean,
      Thirukkaḍalmallai praised by devotees,
      Thirukkovalur and Thirukkuḍandai surrounded with walls.

2252. When the lord who rests on the poisonous snake Adishesa
      raised his flower-like feet, grew to the sky and measured the world,
      the conch in his left hand sounded loud and his shining discus
      that conquers his enemies shot out fire in the sky.

2253. The monkeys in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills
      enter the ponds where flowers bloom, bathe,
      take flowers place them on his feet and worship him.
      O heart, come, let us go there, recite his divine names,
      place the flowers on his feet and worship him.

2254. When the elephant Gajendra
      with tusks like crescent moons and angry eyes
      was caught by a crocodile,
      our lord went to the pond, killed the crocodile and saved him.
      I have decided to become his slave,
      praising his thousand names
      and placing fresh flowers on his feet every day.

2255. I have received the fruit of all the tapas of seven births,
      for I have composed a wonderful garland of Tamil pāsurams
      and placed it at his feet.
      I am fortunate to have written them in fine Tamil.

2256. The lord colored like a cloud
      stays in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills
      where a male elephant dripping with ichor
      plucks bamboo sticks, soaks them in honey
      and gives them to his mate.

2257. It is good for us to take the sandal paste from the hills,
      precious ornaments, silk clothes,
      and fragrant white jasmine flowers
      and offer them at the feet of the wise ancient lord.

2258. O good heart, if we worship the faultless lord
      offering beautiful lotus flowers at his beautiful feet
      and reciting his thousand names and praising him,
      that is the only tapas we need to do.

2259. When he grew, measuring the world and the sky,
      Nānmuhan was the only one who had the fortune
      of washing his golden feet with the water of the Ganges
      and embracing and praising him with all his divine names.

2260. When Rama’s mother Kosalai asked him
      not to go to the forest he did not listen to her,
      and when his wife Sita, soft as a flower,
      told him not to go, he did not listen to her either.
      Wanting only to obey his father’s order, he went to the forest.
      The strength he showed then was equal to when he measured the world.

2261. I have become his slave, love him
      and think only of his divine lotus feet
      lovely as lotuses dripping with honey.
      The joy of worshiping his feet is sweeter
      than the joy of seeing his form.

2262. I saw Nārayaṇan in the day and in my dreams at night,
      and again I saw him truly.
      I worship the beautiful shining feet of the lord
      who carries a discus smeared with flesh
      and his bright form in the sky.

2263. Lakshmi with lovely long sword-like eyes
      sees his divine form all the time as she stays on his chest.
      Why does the earth goddess feel jealous of her?
      The beauty of his form will never be reduced
      no matter who sees him.

2264. With my poor words I worship Thirumāl
      whom the Vedas praise with their divine words
      thinking that Māyan might somehow accept me
      and give me a small bit of his grace.

2265. The lord went as a man-lion and killed Hiraṇyan
      who had the boon that no one could kill him
      and afflicted the gods, not obeying anyone.
      It is like drinking nectar in this beautiful world
      to worship his feet.

2266. I worshiped him saying,
      "He is nectar. He is honey.
      He carries a discus. He churned the milky ocean,
      got the nectar and joyfully gave it to the gods.”
      I praised and worshiped the lord with a garland
      of words sweet as nectar.

2267. Poets cannot see him,
      they can only praise him with garlands of words.
      Even sages doing true tapas cannot see the cloud-colored god.
      What kind of tapas I could have done that I see him now?

2268. Do I know only today the feet of the lord
      who measured the world?
      When I was in my mother’s womb itself I knew him
      and worshiped him with folded hands.
      I know the power of my father, the god of Thirukkoṭṭiyur.

2269. I know that the only way to reach our father,
      the god of Thennarangam, is to leave family life
      and think of him always.
      If devotees follow the divine path,
      they will not go to cruel hell
      and the guarded door of the gods’ world will open for them.

2270. Did you, who were angry with Kamsan, fought and killed him,
      and fought with elephant Kuvalayaabeeḍam and broke its tusks,
      go to Mahābali’s sacrifice as a dwarf
      and ask for three feet of land in ancient times just to take over the world?

2271. Won’t I rule this world
      and go to the world of the gods
      and stay with them in the sky
      if I go and worship lovely-eyed Neḍumāl of Thirumalai?

2272. The ocean-colored lord who saved the Vedas
      received a boon from Mahābali
      and measured the world and the sky with his two divine feet.
      If you worship him, he will give his grace
      and you will not have to worry about hell.

2273. Neḍumāl with a Garuḍa banner,
      and is praised by the gods in the sky
      killed Kamsan by kicking him with his feet.
      If you worship him and praise his names
      quickly you will find how to receive all that you wish.

2274. Hell is cruel and if you collect bad karma
      you will go to the most cruel of hells.
      Before any such terrible thing happens to you,
      worship without ceasing the lord with a conch in his hand
      who split open the mouth of the Asuran when he came as a bird
      and drank the milk of Putana and killed her.

2275. My heart bows to his feet
      and worships the cloud-colored god of beautiful Thiruppāḍagam,
      who split open the chest of his enemy Hiraṇyan
      and swallowed all the seven worlds,

2276. O my heart, all the world praises
      the sapphire-colored lord of Thiruvathiyur
      who split open the chest of the Asuran Hiraṇyan,
      swallowed all the earth at the end of the eon
      and spat it out again to save it.

2277. The highest lord of Athiyur who rides on an eagle
      and rests on the ocean on Adishesa with diamonds on his head,
      is the god of the three sacrifices and the Vedas.
      He is the lord of Shiva who drank poison
      that came from the milky ocean
      and he is also our dear lord.

2278. You, lovely-eyed Neḍumal, king of the gods in the sky,
      abide, embracing Lakshmi on your chest,
      in the temple of Kuḍamukku
      resting on the ocean on thousand-mouthed Adishesa.

2279. The lord who was born on the earth,
      raised in a cowherd village as Nandan’s son,
      grazed the cows, danced on a pot
      and swallowed all the earth
      stays in my heart

2280 . Thirumāl with beautiful eyes went as a dwarf
to Mahābali’s sacrifice and measured the earth and the sky
with his two feet, making Mahābali his slave
as the gods in the sky sprinkled flowers on his divine feet
ornamented with sounding anklets and asked him for his grace.

2281. O Thirumāl, Neḍumāl, Kaṇṇan,
      adorned with a wonderful thulasi garland
      and lord of the gods in the sky,
      who threw a calf at the vilam tree and killed the Asurans,
      my love for you has no limit.
