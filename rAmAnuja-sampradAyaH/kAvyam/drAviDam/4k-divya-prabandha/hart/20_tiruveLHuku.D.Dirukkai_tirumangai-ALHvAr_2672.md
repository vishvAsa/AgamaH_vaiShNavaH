+++
    This is only one Pasuram.

2672. You created Brahma on a large lotus on your navel,
      and you shot your fiery arrows and conquered and burned Lanka
      surrounded with strong forts
      around which even the sun and moon cannot move.
      
      You took the form of a dwarf,
      a Brahmin bachelor dressed in deerskin,
      wore a shining string on your chest
      and went to Mahābali’s sacrifice.
      You asked the king for three feet of land
      and measured all the three worlds and the sky
      with your two feet.
      
      Gajendra the elephant was caught by a crocodile
      and you rode on Garuḍa with beautiful wings,
      went to the deep pond with abundant water,
      making all the directions shake,
      and killed the crocodile
      and saved the long-trunked Gajendra who dripped with ichor.
      
      You are worshipped by Vediyars
      who do five sacrifices with three fires,
      recite the four Vedas and do six deeds.
      Your good devotees controlling their five senses
      and removing desires, pride and egoism from their minds,
      are rid of the good and bad karma that cause future births,
      as they put their minds only on you.
      You know the nature of those
      who do not want to be born again.
      
      You keep in your body the three-eyed Shiva
      who has four arms, is adorned with a snake,
      and has the Ganges flowing in his matted hair.
      He knows your power and worships you
      who swallowed all the seven worlds
      and kept them in your stomach.
      
        You are the six tastes-- sweet, bitter, sour, salty, astringent, pungent.
        You carry six shining weapons in your hands,
        have four arms and are colored like the dark ocean.
        You rest on Adisesha on the ocean.
        The Earth goddess and Lakshmi
        who have beautiful moon-like faces
        stay near your feet at all times of the day and caress them.
        
        You are the four Varṇas,
        and the five elements–sky, fire, ocean, wind, and earth.
        You fought and conquered the seven bulls
        to marry Nappinnai whose hair swarms with six-legged bees
        and lovely-haired Lakshmi stays on your chest.
        All the six religions do not know who you are.
        
        You are the four things–dharma, wealth, pleasure and moksha,
        and the three gods Shiva, Brahma and Vishnu,
        and you, the giver of the results of good and bad karma,
        are the unique god of rich Thirukkuḍandai in the south
        surrounded by flourishing vines
        and groves where flowers always bloom dripping with honey.
        The Kaviri river flows there with its abundant water,
        bringing precious jewels and leaving them on its banks,
        and good paddy flourishes there in beautiful fields.
        You are the god of Thirukkuḍandai
        where the flags on the golden places
        fly in the sky and touch the young crescent moon
        and Vediyars worship you reciting mantras.
        O highest lord, you rest on Adisesha,
        the snake bed on the ocean
        and you know all things. I bow to your feet.
        Remove the results of my karma and my troubles.
