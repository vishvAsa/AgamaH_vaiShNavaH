+++

2082. The world is a lamp for me,
      wide ocean is its ghee,
      and the warm sun is its light.
      I place this garland of words on the feet
      of the lord with a shining discus
      and ask him to take me from the ocean of sorrow.

2083. I do not know when you churned the milky ocean
      or when the whole earth was surrounded with the seas,
      all I know is that the world is created by you
      and you swallowed and spat it out at the end of the eon.

2084. With one foot you measured the whole world
      and with the other rose to the sky and measured it.
      O wonderful lord!
      I cannot understand how you are able to measure the world
      and sky like that.

2085. Our god opens the door of moksha for those
      who control their five senses
      and he himself is the path of moksha.
      Shiva who taught dharma to the four sages
      staying under the shadow of a banyan tree
      and drank poison when the milky ocean was churned
      understands the power of Thirumāl
      and is a part of our lord’s body,

2086. The names of Thirumāl and Shiva are Nāraṇan and Haran
      and Garuḍa and a bull are their vehicles.
      They taught the Vedas and the Agamas to the sages,
      Kailasa and the milky ocean are their temples
      and their actions are protecting and destroying the world.
      One carries a discus and the other spear in his hand,
      and one has a dark shining body like a cloud
      and the other a body like fire.

2087. He has the color of the ocean rolling with waves
      and I have never forgotten him.
      O, innocent ones, how could I forget him today.
      Even when I was in the womb,
      I worshiped the lord folding my hands, and I saw the god
      as I gazed in the direction of Srirangam where he stays.

2088. Our lord is in all the directions with all the gods
      and is in all the actions that they do and in their results.
      All these things are the illusions of Neḍumāl
      who is the everlasting cloud-colored Kaṇṇan,

2089. O Thirumāl, why did you put the conch in your mouth
      and blow it and mesmerize all when you fought in the
      Bharatha battle holding your heroic weapon, the discus in your hand?
      Why did you hide the sun with the wheel of a chariot?

2090. You took the form boar and on your single tusk
      you brought up the earth goddess from the underworld.
      Was that not the same earth that you measured
      with your divine feet
      as the sky and all the directions trembled?

2091. O lord with a heroic discus!
      People say that you really swallowed the earth, hills,
      the oceans rolling with waves, the wind and the sky.
      If one tries to understand how you did that,
      was your mouth as big as the whole earth at that time?

2092. He measured the world with his feet
      and my mouth will not praise any other but him.
      My hands will not worship anyone but him
      who drank the poisonous milk
      from the breasts of the devil Putanā.
      My eyes will not see anyone except him
      and my ears will not hear any other name except his.

2093. The nature of the lord who took the form of a boar to bring
      the earth goddess from the underworld is
      the feelings of all the five sense organs—
      ears, mouth, eyes, nose and body—
      and hot fire, earth, wind, water and the sky,
      undiminished wisdom, knowledge and good dharma.

2094. They who were born as people in ancient times,
      recited the sastras and the Vedas in the proper way
      and worshiped him with the correct rules
      became the excellent gods and reached
      the feet of the lord adorned with a thulasi garland.

2095. People praise various gods in the ways they know,
      saying, “This or that god is our dear lord,”
      and they put their pictures on the wall and worship them,
      but any god that they pray to is only our lord.

2096. The three gods came first,
      and among them the ocean-colored god was first.
      If we do not have his grace,
      the grace given by any of the others is just a waste.

2097. When I realized that I have spent all my days in vain,
      I was afraid and cried,
      and I worshiped the feet of the ocean colored lord with lovely eyes
      resting on Adisesha, the snake bed
      as the water of the strong waves touches his feet.

2098. People praise his heroism and say,
      “When the lord who split open the chest of the Hiraṇyan with his sharp claws
      measured the world, riding on Garuḍa,
      one foot was on the earth and his head touched the sky
      while his arms were extended in all the directions.”

2099. The lord drank the poisonous milk from the breasts of Putanā,
      fought and conquered the elephant Kuvalayaabeedam,
      split open the mouth of the Asuran that came in the form of a bird,
      entered between the Marudu trees and killed the Raksasas,
      and ate the butter from the uri happily.
      He measured the world and the sky at the sacrifice of Mahābali,

2100. O dark ocean,
      Thirumāl has a dark body and beautiful eyes.
      He swallowed the earth
      and slept on a banyan leaf as a baby at the end of the eon
      rests on you, carrying a discus.
      What penance you have done
      to touch always the divine dark body of the lord?

2101. The gods sprinkle fresh flowers, fold their hands
      and worship the beautiful divine lotus feet of the lord
      who cut the chains on the ankles of his father and released him
      and took the form of a dwarf
      and swallowed the earth and the sky.

2102. Lovely-eyed Thirumāl with a discus
      who rides on the bird Garuda
      rests on the snake Adishesa.
      He took water from Mahābali’s hand,
      asked for three feet of land,
      measured the earth with one foot
      and raised his other foot to measure the sky.
      O heart, you know that we should go to him, our refuge.

2103. O lord, you ride on Garuda with dotted wings!
      Yashoda with arms soft and round like bamboo
      tied you with a rope when you stole butter and ate it.
      It is not only I, but the whole world that knows this—
      I have seen the rope marks on your body.

2104. The lord with the color of the ocean rolling with waves
      has scars on his fingers from using his Sharngam bow,
      a mark on his shoulders where Lakshmi leaned on him
      and a scar on his feet from when he kicked Sakaṭāsuran,
      the Asuran in the form of a cart.
      His fingers are swollen
      because he split open with his claws the chest of Hiraṇyan
      as Lakshmi, her hair adorned with flowers, saw him in fear.

2105. O lord with the color of the ocean rolling with waves,
      when Yasodha the cowherdess saw butter on your mouth and fingers
      and tied you to the mortar, you did not cry loudly
      and the neighbors did not hear you.
      Why you did that? Tell me.

2106. My heart praises without ceasing the emerald-colored lord
      who stays in the hills and rests on the ocean.
      He split open the chest of Hiraṇyan
      and, taking the form of a boar, split open the earth
      and went to the underworld to bring up the earth goddess.

2107. If devotees get up in the morning,
      go to Thiruvenkaṭam hills that brighten the mind
      and if every day they worship the lord who wears a thulasi garland,
      the results of their karma will be removed.

2108. The hands of the lord that carry a strong bow
      carried Govardhana hills to save the cows and the cowherds.
      He split open the mouth of the Asuran when he came as a bird,
      broke seven maraa trees with his bow,
      broke the tusks of the heroic elephant Kuvalayābeeḍam,
      and made the blooming kurundam trees fall.

2109. O god with the dark color of a cloud,
      you carry in your hands the valampuri conch and a discus,
      embrace Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth on your chest,
      have Brahma, the creator of the wonderful Vedas on your navel,
      and have Shiva, the destroyer of the three forts in your body.

2110. He is the earth, the wide sky, the wind,
      the roaring ocean and hot fire.
      Know that the lord with lovely eyes
      removed the suffering of Gajendra
      with beautiful eyes and tusks like crescent moon
      when he was caught by a crocodile.
      You know that he will appear when his devotees are in trouble
      and help them.

2111. If devotees keep their hearts pure,
      follow the good path
      and understand clearly what wisdom is,
      their hearts will go to the feet of the lord
      adorned with thulasi garland,
      like a calf that goes to his mother
      understanding that she is his mother.

2112. Even for the time that to blink an eye
      I will not think of anything except the feet of Thirumāl
      who carries a valampuri conch in one hand
      and a golden discus in the other
      and took the form of a man-lion,
      went to Hiraṇyan and split open his chest.

2113. If devotees remove all faults from their minds,
      meditate without blinking their eyes,
      avoid the pleasures of the five senses,
      and embrace only him in their hearts,-
      they will reach the heaven of the lord,
      resting on Adishesa, the thousand-mouthed snake.

2114. The good-natured lord, giving his grace to all,
      taught the Vedas to Brahma so Brahma could give them to the world.
      What is the use if you just recite his names
      and do evening rites without thinking of him in your mind?

2115. O cloud-colored one,
      you swallowed all the seven worlds
      and slept on the banyan leaf.
      The cowherd mother Yashoda whose eyes are large and beautiful,
      fed you milk from her breasts
      without worrying that you had drunk milk from the devil Putanā.
      All people say that your deeds are true.

2116. O tall one, do not think that we are blaming you—
      what we say is because of our love for you.
      Didn’t the ten-headed Rāvaṇa oppose you
      because he wanted to reach your feet?

2117. With a golden discus in your hand
      you fought with Hiraṇyan and split open his chest,
      and you asked for three feet of land from Mahābali at his sacrifice
      and measured the world and the sky.
      Didn’t you do this because you wanted
      to remove the strength of your enemy kings?

2118. In the Thiruvenkaṭam hills,
      the favorite place for Thirumāl who blows a white conch,
      the Vediyars recite the Vedas
      and the learned ones proficient in the good sastras
      carry fragrant lamps, flowers and water,
      come from all directions, go and worship him.

2119. The hill where the Asurans and the gods
      come and worship Thirumāl who, shining like a jewel,
      killed the snake and conquered the heroic elephant of the gypsies
      is Thiruvenkaṭam where the clouds with lightning float.

2120. The lord who rests on the wide ocean
      split open the earth to save the earth goddess,
      carried Govardhana mountain to save the cows and the cowherds,
      frightened the Asuran Kamsan and conquered him
      and abides in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills.
      If I want to recite his names, they are so many.

2121. It is the Thiruvenkaṭam hills
      where gypsies with fine bows and arrows
      carry hot fires in their hands
      and the elephants see them and leave the forest,
      frightened because they think they are stars falling from the sky.
      It is there that the lord stays
      who rejoiced when he conquered the Asuras.

2122. O my heart, even if our mistakes are as large as hills,
      the lord with a golden discus in his hand
      will not be angry with us.
      He will only feel happy for the good qualities that we have.
      From today, even if all the heroic deeds of the lord
      are only untrue gossip,
      you should always think of them as true and believe them.

2123. Even though Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth,
      the earth goddess and the daughter of the cowherd family love him,
      the heart of the ocean-colored god resting on the snake bed
      embraces only Lakshmi from the milky ocean.

2124. If devotees carry flowers and water
      and go to him to worship his feet,
      the fault in their minds and the results of their bad karma
      will disappear
      and they will achieve whatever they want.

2125. In whatever form the devotees wish to see him,
      he will appear to them in that form.
      Whatever name the devotees want to call him
      happily he will have that name.
      When they meditate on him quietly without blinking their eyes,
      whatever color they think he has,
      he will appear in that color, carrying his discus.

2126. The gods in the sky may not know him, but let that be.
      O good heart, we know his heroic nature.
      When Ravana disguised himself pretending he had only one head
      and asked for a boon from Brahma,
      Thirumāl came in the form of a baby,
      and, lying on Brahma’s lap, he counted all the heads of Ravana
      so that Brahma would know the Raksasa Ravana
      was the one asking for the boon.

2127. When the skull of Nānmuhan,
      the giver of the Vedas to the world,
      was stuck to the palm of Shiva when he wandered
      as a beggar wearing a white thread,
      Thirumāl cut his own body
      and poured his blood into the skull of Nānmuhan,
      to release Shiva from his curse.
      If devotees worship our lord, they will rule the earth
      and enjoy their lives like gods in the sky.

2128. If devotees control their five senses
      that are as mighty as rutting elephants,
      not allowing them to wander
      and keeping them on a good path,
      they will see with true wisdom the lord's ankleted feet
      that once saved the snake when it was in distress.

2129. He carries a conch in one hand and in the other
      a fiery discus that he threw at the Asuras
      as the gods and the Asurans looked on and were terrified.
      O heart, be happy that we could reach the divine feet of the lord.

2130. It is not possible for devotees
      to see the ancient cloud-colored god
      adorned with a shining golden crown,
      unless they are born many times on this earth in various forms
      that change like the colors of a peacock's wings.

2131. The lord received three feet of land from generous Mahābali
      after taking water from his hands and grew tall
      to measure the earth and the sky with his two feet.
      If devotees control their five senses
      and worship him sprinkling fresh flowers,
      it is easy for them to see him

2132. The lord came in the form of a man-lion
      and fought fiercely with the matchless Hiraṇyan and killed him.
      If you wish to see his feet,
      make your thoughts pure,
      think and worship him reciting his divine names,
      and he will present himself to you.

2133. The eight Vasus, eleven Rudras,
      twelve suns and two Asvins
      carry beautiful flowers and go to Thirumāl everyday
      to adorn him with garlands, folding their hands
      and worshiping him always.

2134. When Thirumāl walks the snake Ādisesha is his umbrella,
      when he sits he is a throne for him
      and he is his sandals when he stands.
      He is a floating bed for the god on the ocean always,
      a beautiful lamp, a soft silky dress,
      and the pillow the lord loves to rest on.

2135. He is the lovely-eyed lord
      who conquered the snake Kālingan,
      fought with the elephant Kuvalayābeeḍam,
      killed the Asurans when they came as kurundam trees,
      split open the beak of the Asuran that came as a bird,
      killed the wrestlers sent by Kamsan,
      drank milk from the breasts of the devil Putana,
      danced the Kuravai dance,
      carried Govardhana hill as an umbrella
      to protect the cows that he grazed and the cowherds,
      and ate the food that was offered for Indra.

2136. The devotees of the god of the gods who rests on the ocean
      will not have any troubles
      no matter what bad or good acts they have done—
      they will be always his devotees.
      Even if the messengers of Yama search for them
      they will not be able to find them.

2137. Who could see the wonderful lord?
      People can only prattle his names.
      Even though he was sitting on the lotus on his chest
      Brahma could not see Kaṇṇan’s lotus feet.

2138. When I was afraid
      that I would experience the results of my bad karma,
      I came to the divine feet of you with your beautiful garlands,
      learned to say your mantra “Namō Nārāyaṇā!”
      praised you and worshiped you.

2139. O heart, rise and come,
      let us carry lamps and flowers and worship him.
      All the mantras and any sastras that you have learned
      are only to worship the feet of Thirumāl.
      There is nothing more than that.
      Let us go to worship the feet of the lord.

2140. If you want to remove the results of your bad karma,
      other troubles in your life, sickness and sin,
      your only refuge is Rāma
      who opposed and fought Rāvaṇa in Lanka
      and killed him with his bow
      when that king of the Rakshasas
      kidnapped his wife with a waist soft as a vine.

2141. Nānmuhan seated on a lotus on the navel of Thirumāl
      gave the Vedas to all the creatures of the world
      surrounded by the oceans,
      yet even he does not know the path to moksha.
      Only Thirumāl knows that and he is the refuge for all.

2142. The world, the end of the eon that destroys the world, ,
      the matchless dark oceans, the hills,
      fire in the world, , the wind and the sky
      all were created only by Thirumāl with his wisdom.

2143. The arms of the god resting on the snake Adisesha
      hold the discus that killed the Asurans
      when he went through the two marudam trees,
      broke them and made them fall,
      they killed the Asurans
      when they came as beautiful kurundam trees,
      and they conquered the seven bulls so he could marry Nappinnai.
      They reached out to all the eight directions
      when the lord took the form of a dwarf
      and measured all the seven worlds and the sky.

2144. My hands worship nothing but him.
      My ears hear only his sweet words .
      I will not think of any pleasure
      except praising the sounding anklets on the feet
      of the lord whose arrows never miss their targets.
      Anyone should feel ashamed to desire any pleasure but that.

2145. I do not desire the wealth of others or join with mean people.
      I make friends only with good people.
      I do not feel amazement at the deeds of any god but Thirumāl.
      How could any bad karma come to me?

2146. The lord stays far away and is hard for anyone to know.
      If devotees worship the feet
      of the dark-colored lord with beautiful eyes and a thousand names
      they will not experience the results of their karma
      and they will not go to cruel hell.
      They will never, even for the shortest time, involve themselves in bad deeds.

2147. The songs that the world learns when it wakes up,
      the pāsurams of the Vedas that the Vediyars recite,
      all things that the world recites, thinks, and worships
      are the names of him with a discus in his hand.

2148. Wise devotees look only towards him,
      the beloved of Lakshmi seated on a beautiful lotus,
      just as the rivers go toward the sea,
      beautiful lotus flowers turn toward the sun,
      and lives move towards Yama. ?

2149. O lord, you stay in the sky,
      you are on the earth,
      you abide in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills
      and you are in the recitation of the four Vedas.
      Who can know the milky ocean where you rest?
      Who can know your power?
      Who can know your form even in all the eons.

2150. People say it is true that when you were a baby
      you swallowed all the seven worlds and lay on a banyan leaf.
      Where was that banyan leaf?
      Was it in the ocean? Was it in the sky?
      Was it on the earth?
      Tell me, O god who carried Govardhana mountain
      surrounded with groves.

2151. Praise Thirumāl for as long as you can speak.
      Worship him until your body leaves the world.
      It is good if you worship him
      adorning him with flower garlands, performing sacrifices,
      reciting his names and saying mantras
      and doing any other deeds you can as praise to him.

2152. O strong heart,
      even if I remain healthy without any sickness and old age
      and rule the whole world for all the four eons,
      I only want the love of the lord with a heroic discus.

2153. My heart says, “Love the lord with a discus in his hands,”
      my tongue says, “Praise and worship his divine arms,”
      my eyes say, “See the lord without birth”
      and my ears say, “Hear the fame of the lord, adorned with lovely ornaments.”

2154. O heart!.
      You may praise or blame him who is adorned with thulasi garlands,
      you may admire him or scold him.
      He is the flourishing water of the ocean, the hills, the wide sky,
      the wind, the body and life of all creatures.

2155. Shiva rides a bull and Thirumāl rides Garuḍa,
      Shiva burned the three forts
      and Māl split open the chest of Hiraṇyan,
      Shiva wears sacred ash and our lord has a sapphire color,
      Shiva has Shakthi for half of his body and Thirumāl has Lakshmi seated on his chest,
      Shiva has long matted hair and Thirumāl is adorned with a large crown.
      Shiva has the Ganges in his matted hair
      and Thirumāl measured the world with his long legs.
      May they both protect us.

2156. If devotees worship him
      they will not experience the results of their karma
      and any troubles that come to them will go away.
      If devotees meditate on him, they will not become old
      and if they worship his feet,
      they will find good paths in their lives.

2157. If devotees follow good paths and worship the lord
      they will be like the three faultless gods in the sky
      and Thiruvenkaṭam of the wonderful lord
      who measured the world and the sky
      will give moksa to them.

2158. All your troubles will go away
      if you praise him saying,
      “You stand in Thiruvenkaṭam,
      you are seated in Vaikuṇtam,
      you recline in Thiruvekka
      and you walk in the beautiful golden
      Thirukkovalur filled with ponds.”

2159. O heart, rise.
      We will take fresh flowers from a punnai tree,
      sprinkle them on his feet, fold our hands
      and worship him who rests on the thousand-headed snake Adisesha.
      He killed the cruel crocodile to save the elephant Gajendra
      when he called the lord for help.
      Who will have any affliction if they worship him?

2160. Who will blame the one who gives
      and not the one who receives?
      Did you not ask for three feet of land
      and receive the boon with water poured on your palm
      from Mahābali and did you not grow tall
      as your beautiful ornamented foot touched the high sky?

2161. A snake terrified of an eagle, his enemy,
      ran to the ocean where you rest and asked for refuge,
      and you, the dark colored Māyavan, the strong one,
      helped it with your generosity.
      Who could help like that except you?

2162. When the gods fought with the Asuras and asked your help,
      he churned the milky ocean with them
      using Mandara mountain as a the stick and Vāsuki, the snake as a rope,
      and he gave them the nectar that came out of the ocean.
      Isn’t his name the weapon that saves from cruel hell?

2163. O Venkaṭam, you are the hill where lord stays
      who shot his arrow and killed Mārisan
      when he came as a golden deer.
      Women with sword-like eyes go there
      to worship the lord with fresh flowers and garlands
      carrying lamps whose brightness
      hides the light of the stars in the sky.

2164. You rest on the ocean and you hurl your strong discus
      at your Asuran enemies, killing them,
      but you were born as Kaṇṇan
      and with compassion you carried
      Govardhana mountain with your arms and saved the cows.
      You fought with the seven bulls
      and conquered them to marry Nappinnai.
      What heroic deeds you have done!

2165. O lord, who knows your power?
      You measured the world with your feet,
      yet you found that same world so small
      that you could carry it on your tusk
      when you took the form of a boar
      to bring the earth goddess from the underworld.

2166. O heart, controlling your five senses,
      you carry water and worship him in the proper way,
      but do you know the place where he rests on the snake bed?
      Do you know where his eagle flag is? Tell me.

2167. O lord, you, the generous one, carried Govardhana hills
      to save the cows and the cowherds from the storm.
      As you stay with Lakshmi in the beautiful Thikkovalur temple,
      do you stay at the entrance, in the middle or inside?

2168. All countries worship him, knowing how
      he threw the calf at the vilam tree and killed the Asuras.
      Lock the doors of hell!
      If the devotees worship his ankleted feet
      they will not go there.

2169. I look only for your divine feet,
      I only sing your fame
      and I worship only the golden feet
      of you with a shining discus.
      How could anything hurt me?

2170. There is no one who can match my dear lord.
      Since I have his grace how could anyone be equal to me?
      The blooming dark kāyām flower is fortunate
      to have the same beautiful dark color that he has.

2171. O Mādhava,
      Hiraṇyan thought that he had
      the boon of not being killed by a man
      and he did not want to worship your feet bowing his head to you.
      Though he was as strong as you, you were able to kill him
      taking the form of a man-lion.

2172. He took the form of a boar and split open the earth.
      If devotees do not remove
      the darkness in their hearts and inside their bodies,
      lighting up their wisdom everyday
      and worshiping the feet of the lord,
      they will not attain moksha.

2173. O Thirumāl!
      You are the sky, fire, the rolling ocean,
      the wind, honey, and milk.
      Was your stomach that contained the world before you spat it out
      full when you swallowed the butter
      that Yashoda the cowherdess churned and kept?

2174. Carrying in your handsome flower-like hand a golden discus,
      you split open the stomach of Hiraṇyan
      when he came to fight with you
      unsheathing his sword, as you opened your mouth wide
      showing your teeth and terrifying him. Why?
      Did you get angry at him to destroy his pride?

2175. Māyavan showed the sages all the worlds he had swallowed,
      opening his mouth wide and his eyes like fire.
      My tongue will not praise any other except him.
      even for a moment.

2176. The words “Namō Nārāyaṇā”
      that you say with your tongue without stopping
      are the way to attain everlasting moksha.
      Why is it that people cannot understand this
      and go in wrong ways?

2177. O heart, know and understand this well.
      The beautiful eyed- Thirumāl is both dharma and sin.
      He is the earth, the ocean with rolling waves, wind and sky.
      Worship him.

2178. Compassionate, you saved the elephant Gajendra
      so he could live with his mate.
      Didn’t the golden Ganges receive Thirumāl’s grace
      before she flowed as a fiery river
      into the spreading matted hair
      of Shiva who wears vibhuti?

2179. Even though both the divine Shiva
      with a body that shines like gold and thick matted hair
      and Neḍumāl who measured the world and the sky with his two feet
      have two different forms
      one is inside the body of the other.

2180. O good heart, if the devotees meditate
      on the faultless eternal lord of Thiruvenkaṭam,
      he enters their hearts.
      Understand that Thirumāl resting
      on Ādisesha in the milky ocean
      is in your heart.

2181. O my heart, if you keep in your mind
      the Māyavan, Kesavan adorned with cool thulasi garland,
      who kicked Sakaṭāsuran with the same shining lotus feet
      that measured the world, you will attain moksha.

Mudal Thiruvanthadi ends.
