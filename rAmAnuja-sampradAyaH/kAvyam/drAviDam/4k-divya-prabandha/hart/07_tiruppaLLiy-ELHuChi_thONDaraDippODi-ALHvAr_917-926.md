917. When the sun rises in the east from the peak of the mountain
     and darkness has gone and it is morning
     and all the beautiful flowers that drip honey bloom,
     the gods of the sky all come before you to worship you.
     Elephants, male and female, come and, as drums are beaten,
     it seems the sound of a roaring ocean spreads everywhere.
     O dear god of Srirangam, wake up and give us your grace.

918. The breeze from the east blows
     and spreads the fragrance of mullai flowers blooming on vines.
     The swans sleeping on flowers wake up
     and shake the wet dew from their wings.
     O lord, when the elephant Gajendra was suffering
     and called you in his distress,
     you came and saved him, killing the crocodile
     whose mouth with white teeth was as deep as a cave.
     O dear god of Srirangam,
     wake up and give us your grace.

919. The sun with its rays makes all the directions bright,
     the darkness goes away, dawn appears,
     the bright light of the moon and the dew go away,
     the buds on the branches of the kamuhu trees in the green groves
     split open spreading their fragrance and the morning breeze blows.
     O dear god of Srirangam with a shining discus in your strong hand,
     wake up and give us you grace.

920. The cowherds untie their buffaloes for grazing
     and the music of their bamboo flutes
     and the sound of the cowbells spread in all directions
     as swarms of bees fly all over the fields.
     You who carry a bow, the strong king of Ayodhya,
     bull among the gods,
     destroyed the clan of Rakshasas in Lanka
     and you, the strong one, helped the pure sages
     do sacrifices and protected them.
     O dear god of Srirangam, wake up and give us your grace.

921. Birds chirp in the groves blooming with flowers,
     the darkness goes away and morning arrives.
     In the east, the ocean roars
     and the gods in the sky carry many flower garlands
     swarming with bees and come to garland you
     and worship your feet.
     This is the temple where Vibhishaṇa,
     the king of Lanka, worshiped you.
     O dear god, wake up and give us your grace.

922. Is this the host of suns riding on tall chariots decorated with bells?
     Is it the troupe of eleven Rudras riding on bulls?
     Is that the six faced-god riding a beautiful peacock?
     All these gods and the celestial physicians and the Vasus are here,
     while the other divine gods come on horses and chariots singing and dancing.
     The crowd of gods is like a flood
     and they have gathered in front of your temple that looks like a huge mountain.
     O dear god of Srirangam, wake up and give us your grace

923. Is this the crowd of gods from heaven?
     Is this the throng of sages doing penance
     and the medicine men of the gods?
     Is that Indra coming on his elephant Airāvata?
     In front of your temple, Gandharvas, Vidyadharas
     and Apsarases are all gathered together to worship you
     and it seems as if there is no space left in the sky or on the earth.
     O dear god of Srirangam, wake up and give us your grace.

924. Some gods in the sky arrive with fragrances,
     some carry huge pots of treasure
     and shining mirrors and come to give them to you.
     Good sages bring things suitable for you to wear
     and Nārada comes with his Thumburu veena to play music.
     The sun god rises, spreading his bright light
     and darkness disappears from the sky.
     O dear god of Srirangam, wake up and give us your grace.

925. Faultless small drums, cymbals,
     yāzhs, flutes and big drums play music everywhere.
     Kinnaras, Garuḍas, Gandarvas and others sing.
     The sages, the gods in the sky, Saraṇars, Yaksas,
     and Siddhas are all fascinated by the music
     and come to worship your divine feet.
     O dear god of Srirangam, wake up and give us your grace.

926. Are these fragrant blooming lotuses?
     Is this the sun god rising over the roaring ocean?
     You are the god of Srirangam surrounded by a river
     where curly-haired women with waists as small as tuḍi drums
     bathe, squeeze their clothes,
     and come out of the water to dress.
     I am Thoṇḍaraḍippoḍi, your poor devotee.
     I brought thulasi garlands in baskets to decorate your body.
     I am your slave. Give me your grace.
     O dear god of Srirangam, wake up and give me your grace.
