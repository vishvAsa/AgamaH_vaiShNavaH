927. He, the faultless one, the king of the gods in the sky
     who gives us his grace and makes us his devotees,
     is pure, the lord of the Thiruvenkaṭam hills
     surrounded with fragrant groves.
     He is the god of justice in the sky,
     and the dear one of Srirangam surrounded by tall walls.
     His lotus feet came and entered my sight.

928. He is pleasant and joyful measured the world,
     growing so tall that his crown touched the sky,
     and as Rāma of the Kakutstha dynasty
     he killed the Rakshasas with his cruel arrows.
     My thoughts are immersed in the red garment
     that adorns the waist of the god of Srirangam
     surrounded by fragrant groves.

929. Female monkeys jump everywhere
     in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills in the north
     where the gods in the sky come to worship
     the lord resting on the snake bed.
     He wears a red garment with the color of the evening sky
     and above that is Nānmuhan whom he created.
     His beauty is this devotee’s life.

930. The ocean-colored god shot sharp arrows,
     conquering and killing the ten-headed Ravaṇa, king of Lanka
     surrounded by high walls on all four sides.
     The beautiful ornament tied on the divine waist
     of the god of Srirangam
     where bees that drink honey sing
     and beautiful peacocks dance
     entered my heart and stayed there.

931. Making me his dear devotee and entering my heart.
     He removed all the bad karma that has burdened me all my life.
     I don’t know what hard penance I could have done for this to happen.
     The ornamented divine chest of the god of Srirangam
     made me his slave and protects me.

932. Our father, the lord of Srirangam
     surrounded with groves where bees live
     removed the suffering of Shiva
     whose matted hair holds the crescent moon.
     See, he swallowed all the earth,
     the sky and the seven mountains
     and he gives his grace to me.

933. He holds a curving conch in one hand
     and a fire-like discus in the other.
     He, resting on a snake bed,
     the god of beautiful Srirangam
     has a body is like a tall mountain
     and long hair adorned with a fragrant Thulasi garland.
     The red mouth of that Māyanār has stolen my heart.

934. He, the ancient god of the gods in the sky,
     came as a man-lion and split open the body of Hiraṇyan.
     The large, red-lined divine eyes on his dark face,
     shining and touching his ears, make me crazy.

935. He slept on a banyan leaf when he was a baby
     swallowed all the seven worlds,
     and rests on a snake bed in Srirangam.
     His dark body, endlessly beautiful,
     is adorned with pearl garlands
     and precious, lovely diamond chains.
     Oh, his blue body has stolen my heart!

936. He, the cowherd, who has the color of a cloud
     and a mouth is filled with butterhas stolen my heart.
     Rangan, the beautiful one, is the king of the gods in the sky.
     Once they have seen him who is as sweet as nectar,
     my eyes do not wish to see anything else.
