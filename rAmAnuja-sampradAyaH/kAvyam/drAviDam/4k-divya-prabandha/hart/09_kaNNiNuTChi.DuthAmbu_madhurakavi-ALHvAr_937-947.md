937. I praise the god, the divine Māyan, my father,
     who was tied by Yashoda with a small rope.
     If I approach the place where the Nambi of south Kuruhur stays
     and say his name, nectar will spring from my tongue.

938. I praise him with my tongue and relish it.
     I yearn for the golden feet of Nambi of Thirukkuruhur
     and I know no other god but Nambi of Thirukuruhur.
     I wander and sing sweet songs about him.

939. Even if I have to wander all over,
     I will go to rich Thirukkuruhur
     and see the dark, beautiful form of the divine god.
     If I go there and become a devotee of Nambi
     that will be the most wonderful thing I could ever have.

940. The excellent, orthodox Vediyars
     skilled in the four Vedas
     do not think I am a good person,
     but Sadagopan Nambi accepts me
     and he is my mother, my chief and my ruler.

941. Before, I believed in the wealth of others
     and beautiful women,
     but today I have become a friend and devotee
     of Nambi of Thirukkuruhur,
     filled with pure golden palaces, and I dance there.

942. My dear god gave his grace
     so I could praise his fame from today
     for the next seven births.
     Nambi of Thirukkuruhur,
     filled with hills that look like large palaces,
     will not disgrace me.

943. My chief Māṛan the son of Kāri
     accepted me and made my bad karma go away.
     I will tell the people of all the eight directions
     of the grace I have received
     from Sadagopan, the wonderful Tamil poet.

944. He sang a thousand sweet Tamil pāsurams
     through the grace of god
     and described the meaning of the divine Vedas
     so that his devotees praise the blessings
     that he received from the god.
     His giving his blessing is the best thing in the world.

945. He described the meaning of the Vedas
     that the best Vediyars know and recite.
     My chief Sadagopan praised by all
     made me learn the Vedas.
     To be his devotee and to serve him
     is the greatest love I can receive. CHECK

946. Nambi will accept anyone as his devotee
     whether or not he receives benefit from him,
     even if he is not his friend.
     The Nambi Thirukkuruhur
     surrounded by beautiful groves where cuckoo birds sing
     will change him and accept him, and keep him with him.
     I am striving to receive the love of Nambi,
     worshipping his ankleted feet.

947. Nambi of south Thirukuruhur, our friend,
     is the friend of all who approach him.
     If devotees believe in Madhurakavi’s words,
     they will see Vaikuṇṭam and abide there.
