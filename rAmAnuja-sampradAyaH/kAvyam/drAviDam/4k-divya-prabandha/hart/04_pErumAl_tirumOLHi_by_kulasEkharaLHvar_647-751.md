When will I see my god, the lord of Thiruvarangam

647. When will the day come when my two eyes see
     the dark god shining like a komalam jewel,
     resting on his beautiful white shining bed, the king of snakes
     with a thousand shining foreheads
     that remove the darkness with their bright diamonds,
     as the god’s feet are washed
     by the clear water of the Ponni river flowing
     in the Thiruppadi of Srirangam.
     When will my two eyes see him and feel happy?

648. When will the day come
     that I can praise wholeheartedly our god, Māyon,
     decorated with fragrant garlands
     and dark as a kāyām flower?
     He stays in my mind like a pillar
     and rests on the water in Srirangam
     on the fiery snake that has a curving body
     and a thousand heads that spit fire
     and that looks like a canopy made of fresh flowers.
     When will I see him?

649. When will the day come
     when I can place flowers under his feet
     and approach him with his devotees
     as the good Nānmuhan with four faces
     and eight beautiful eyes praises him with his four tongues?
     Our dear lord shining like pure gold
     keeps Nānmuhan on a lovely lotus on his navel
     while he sleeps on the beautiful snake bed in Srirangam.
     When will I see him?

650. When will the day come when I fold my hands
     and worship the ocean-colored lord,
     sprinkling pure fresh flowers with my hands
     for him who split open the beak of the bird?
     He is strong as a bull among the cowherds,
     the king of the gods in the sky,
     and is sweet Tamil and Sanskrit poetry.
     The lord who carried Govardhana mountain to save the cows
     rests on a snake bed in Srirangam
     where sages without attachment
     praise him with their tongues.
     When will I see him?

651. When will the day come
     when I worship, bowing my head,
     and see the dear sapphire-colored lord
     decorated with garlands
     resting on the snake bed in Srirangam
     that is rich and filled with palaces and beautiful porches?
     He is praised by Narada and the rishi Thumburu there ,
     playing sweet matchless music on their yāzhs
     and Nānmuhan, adorned with beautiful flowers,
     worships him constantly with the incomparable ancient Vedas.
     When will I see him?

652. When will the day come when I worship
     melting in my heart and see the divine face
     bright as the moon and the lotus eyes of him
     resting on the snake bed in beautiful Srirangam
     surrounded by groves blooming with fragrant flowers?
     Nānmuhan who stays on a beautiful lotus,
     Shiva, Indira and all other gods, Apsarases
     and wise sages join together and sprinkle flowers
     in all the directions and worship him there.
     When will I see him?

653. When will the day come
     when my eyes, filled with tears,
     see the dark-colored Māyon resting on the snake bed
     in beautiful Srirangam on the Kaveri river?
     He changes the evil hearts of people to good,
     helps them control their five senses
     and relieves them of the burden of their troubles and sickness,
     making them his devotees
     so they can follow the ways of dharma in their minds.
     When will I see him?

654. When will the day come
     when I who have done bad karma
     can see and join happily the god
     resting on the snake bed in Srirangam
     surrounded by groves and flourishing fields where fish frolic?
     He protects the world with his long bent bow, conch,
     sword, his discus that destroys his enemies
     and his vehicle Garuḍa that flies in the sky.
     When will I see him?

655. When will the day come
     when I worship, jumping and rolling on the ground,
     and see the dear lord with a discus
     resting on the snake bed in Srirangam
     where the beating of beautiful drums
     is like the sound of the ocean
     and devotees, joined together in a group
     and loving the lord in their minds,
     sing devotional songs,
     shed tears like rain and praise him happily?
     When will I see him?

656. When will the day come
     when I see the group of happy devotees
     and join them and am joyful
     in the divine temple of beautiful Srirangam
     where Thirumāl rests facing south
     giving his grace so that the wide sky pours rain,
     the gods in the heavens are saved,
     the earth flourishes,
     the people of the world survive,
     the sorrow of people disappears,
     good health increases in the world
     and his devotees live happily?
     When will I see him?

657. Kulasekaran, the king with a strong army
     who carries a victorious shining sword
     and sits under a royal umbrella,
     composed ten Tamil pāsurams praising the lord of Srirangam
     who rests on the snake bed on Ponni river.
     If devotees learn these pāsurams well and recite them
     they will stay under the feet of Nāraṇan
     who showers goodness to all.

Lord of Southern Thiruvarangam.

658. If I am able to see and join
     the happy group of true devotees
     who call, sing and dance, enthralled,
     and think only of Rangan of south Srirangam,
     as sweet as honey, hard to find,
     decorated with garlands that never wither,
     with the goddess of wealth seated on his chest,
     that will be the purpose of this birth.

659. If I can see and join the devotees
     who praise him saying,
     “O Ranga, you embrace Lakshmi,
     seated on a lotus with blooming buds.
     You cut down the tall mango tree with your shining sword
     and you grazed the cows,”
     and if I can think only of him and call him,
     dance, sing and worship the dust on his devotees’ feet,
     why should I desire to bathe in the Ganges?

660. His devotees sing and praise him, saying,
     “You conquered the bulls.
     Taking the form of a boar you split the earth.
     As Rāma you conquered your enemy Ravaṇan.
     You came as a dwarf and measured the earth.”
     When I see your devotees as they make the front yard
     of Rangan’s temple wet with their tears
     that are like the flow of abundant water of the rich Ponni river,
     I will put on my head the good dust
     that is beneath their divine feet.

661. My heart praises and worships the divine feet
     of the devotees who call, worship, melt and praise him, saying,
     “Nāraṇa, you are our dear god.
     You were not afraid that Yashoda might punish you
     when she saw you stealing and eating the butter,
     good yogurt and milk.
     You stood there bravely and tapped your arms in front of her.”

662. He has the color of a dark cloud
     and carries a heroic bow.
     He killed seven evil bulls, breaking their horns,
     and he danced on the snake Kalingan.
     My mind trembles
     when I think of the devotees
     whose bodies shake when they worship Rangan
     of southern Srirangam
     surrounded by strong shining stone walls.

663. In all my births, my heart worships and praises
     those devotees who love and serve Rangan
     and wander everywhere to show
     the faultless good path to sinners
     who do not have devotion
     and do not worship the divine feet of Thirumāl,
     the lord without beginning or end,
     the wonderful one, the dear god of the gods.

664. My heart loves and praises
     the feet of the devotees
     who love Thirumāl and shed tears,
     melting in their hearts as they worship him,
     a bright wonderful light,
     Rangan of Srirangam, with a red mouth,
     teeth like pearls, a body dark as a cloud
     and a chest decorated with Thulasi garlands.

665. He has lovely flower-like eyes
     and his divine mountain-like chest
     wears a fragrant thulasi garland
     swarming with bees and dripping with honey
     as he rests on the milky ocean.
     My heart falls in love with those devotees
     who are fascinated by him
     and wander, sing, dance and worship Rangan, our dear lord.

666. The devotees of Rangan, my lord and father,
     as they shed tears of joy,
     tremble, long for him in their hearts
     worship, dance and sing.
     They seem mad but they are not.
     It is those people who do not worship, dance, sing
     and praise him who are truly mad.

667. Kulasekharan, the king of Uraiyur,
     the lord of Kuḍal Nagar and the protector of Kolli hills
     composed sweet Tamil pāsurams on Rangan,
     the beloved of Lakshmi.
     He abides in the minds of his true devotees
     if they think only of him and serve him as his slaves.
     If they learn and recite these pāsurams
     they will become the devotees of his devotees.

668. All the people of this world
     think that the false life on this earth is true.
     I do not want to join them.
     I call you, “O dear father, Ranga!”
     and suffer falling in love with you, my Thirumāl.

669. The people of the world
     love women with beautiful waists as thin as threads.
     I do not want to join them.
     I call you, saying, “O Ranga who sleep on the banyan leaf,
     my love increases for you, the Thirumāl,
     and I suffer with love for you.”

670. The people of this world fall in love when Kāma shoots
     his mischievous arrows from his beautiful bow.
     I do not want to join them.
     My Rangan’s chest is adorned with garlands
     and he is my good Nāraṇan who rests on Adisesha.
     He saves his devotees from falling into hell.
     I am crazy for him.

671. The people of this world
     crave food and clothes and search for them.
     I do not want to join them.
     See, he drank milk from the breasts of the cruel devil Putanā,
     and I am crazy for Rangan, the lord of the world.

672. I do not join with those who do evil things
     when there are good things to do.
     I am crazy for the ancient one, the cowherd, Rangan,
     the beloved husband of innocent Lakshmi
     seated on a beautiful lotus.

673. I will not join people
     if they are not the devotees of the highest. .
     I do not think the life of any other god in the sky is best.
     For all my seven births I want to be a crazy devotee
     of my dear god of the gods of divine Srirangam.

674. My mind shuns the thought of joining anyone
     who is not your devotee.
     I call you, “O Thirumāl with beautiful eyes,
     you are my Rangan, you are my lord!”
     and I become crazy for you, my beloved. .

675. Everyone in the world looks crazy to me.
     and I am also crazy.
     I tell this to all and call you,
     “O cowherd, Ranga!”
     and I become crazy for you, my dear lord.

676. The king of Kongu country Kulasekharar
     thinks only of the feet of him who rests on the ocean,
     and he composed pāsurams about the devotees
     who are crazy for the lord.
     If devotees recite the words of Kulasekaran
     they will have no troubles in their lives.
     Lord of Thiruvenkaṭam hills

677. I do not want this body that is a bundle of flesh.
     I want to be born as a kurugu bird that lives
     on the branches of the trees in Thiruvenkaṭam
     of him with a conch in his left hand
     who conquered seven strong bulls.
     I want only to be his slave.

678. I do not want endless wealth or status,
     I don’t want to be surrounded by heavenly women
     or have the joy of ruling the sky
     and a kingdom on the earth.
     I want to be born as a fish in a spring
     in Thiruvenkaṭam filled with groves
     flourishing with flowers that drip honey.

679. He carries a shining round discus.
     Shiva with matted hair, Nanmuhan and Indra
     could not enter the divine entrance of Vaikuṇṭam
     even when they approached it,
     but I will enter holding the golden plate
     that the king of Thiruvenkaṭam ate from.

680. Māyon rests on the cool milky ocean
     where fertile coral-creepers float.
     I would have the good fortune of blooming
     as a shenbaga flower in Thiruvenkaṭam hills
     where a swarm of bees sings and praises him.
     I will see the feet of Māyon, decorated with anklets,
     as he stays in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills.

681. I do not want to sit
     on the neck of a rutting elephant that frightens everyone
     and know the joy of riding it.
     I want to have the good fortune
     of standing as a pole in the beautiful Venkaṭam hills
     of our beloved lord.

682. I do not want to enjoy
     the dance and songs of heavenly women
     like Urvasi and Menaka with waists as thin as lightning.
     I want to have the good fortune of being a golden peak
     in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills
     where bees swarm and sing “tenna, tenna.”

683. I do not want the luxury of sitting
     under a white royal umbrella
     bright as the moon that rules the sky.
     I want to be a forest river that flows
     from the Thiruvenkaṭam hills surrounded with groves
     blooming with flowers that drip honey.

684. I want to be a path on the Thiruvenkaṭam hills
     surrounded by cool fragrant groves,
     where he stays who is the meaning of the Vedas
     and who helped Nanmuhan, Indra
     and Shiva with the crescent moon in his matted hair
     when they performed sacrifices.

685. O, Thirumāl, you take away the bad karma of all.
     You are the highest ! You stay in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills.
     Devotees, the gods in the sky and Apsarases
     stand at the entrance of your temple to see you.
     I will become a step at the threshold of your temple
     and I will see your coral mouth.

686. Even if I were to become the king
     of the world of the gods,
     rule it beneath a sole umbrella
     and enjoy the waist of Urvasi,
     decorated with beautiful golden ornaments,
     I would not want it.
     I want to become anything on the golden hills
     of Thiruvenkaṭam of my lord. .

687. Kulasekharan with a sharp spear
     that kills his enemies worshiped the lord
     of Thiruvenkaṭam hills with cool and lovely slopes
     and, wishing to see his golden shining feet,
     composed pāsurams praising him.
     If Tamil scholars learn well these pāsurams of Kulasekaran
     they will become his good devotees.

Lord of Vitruvakkoṭṭam.

688. You are the beloved lord of Vitruvakkoṭṭam
     surrounded with fragrant blooming groves.
     Do not give me troubles—
     I have no refuge but you.
     I am like a crying child thinking of the love
     of the mother who gave birth to it
     even if she goes away when she is angry.

689. A girl of a good family knows no one
     except the husband who married her
     even if he treats her so badly
     that those who see hate him.
     I am like her. You are my father,
     the lord of Vitruvakkoṭṭam
     surrounded by forts that touch the sky.
     Even if you are like a husband and possess me,
     I will praise only your feet decorated with sounding anklets.

690. You are my father, the god of Vitruvakkoṭṭam
     surrounded by fertile fields where fish swim.
     Even if you do not look at me,
     I have no refuge except you.
     I am like those who live depending on the rule
     of a king decorated with garlands
     even if, unconcerned, he causes them much pain.

691. O my father, lord of Vitruvakkoṭṭam,
     a patient loves and does not leave a doctor
     even when he cuts him with a knife and burns him.
     I am like that patient. Even if you cause me pain
     that I must bear, I am enthralled by you.
     I am your slave and look only for your grace
     and think you are my only friend.

692. O my father, lord of Vitruvakkottam
     who conquered the strong cruel-eyed elephant,
     where can I go and be saved except beneath your feet?
     I am like a huge bird that wanders
     looking for the shore of the ocean with rolling waves
     and, unable to find it, comes back
     to the mast of a ship.

693. You are my father, the lord of Vitruvakkoṭṭam,
     where red lotuses bloom only under the hot sun
     even though the sun comes to the middle of the sky
     and burns them with its heat.
     I am like those lotuses.
     Even if you do not take away my bad karma,
     my heart only melts for your endless grace.

694. O my father, lord of Vitruvakkoṭṭam,
     even when it has not rained for a long time,
     the green crops look at the huge dark clouds
     floating in the sky hoping it will rain.
     I am like them. I am your slave.
     Even if my troubles will not go away,
     my heart will look only for you.

695. O my father, lord of Vitruvakkoṭṭam,
     even if all the rivers come together
     spread and flood everywhere,
     they cannot stay where they are but must join the ocean.
     I wish to join you as those rivers join the ocean.
     O virtuous one who have the color of a dark shining cloud.
     See, I have no way to find refuge
     except to come to you for your grace.

696. O my father, lord of Vitruvakkoṭṭam,
     I want only you with a shining discus bright as lightning in your hand.
     I think of you only as my wealth
     and want no other riches.
     I am your slave and I want only you.

697 Kulasekharan with a victorious spear
loved the god and composed ten good Tamil pāsurams
praising Thirumāl and saying, “You are my father,
the lord of Vitruvakkoṭṭam.
Even if you do not give me your grace
I have no other refuge than your feet.”
If devotees learn and recite these ten excellent Tamil pāsurams
of Kulasekharan they will not go to hell.

Kaṇṇan and the cowherd girls.

698. “Many of the cowherd women in this town
     decorated with fresh flowers
     say they don’t want to embrace your chest
     because you lied to them.
     I am standing on a sand dune
     on the bank of the Yamuna river
     shaking in the cold that comes after a strong rain.
     O Vasudeva, I am waiting for you to come.”

699. “You saw a lovely girl with beautiful fish-like eyes
     churning yogurt in her home near you
     and you entered her house like a thief and said,
     ‘I will also churn yogurt.’
     When the girl with long beautiful hair
     that was decorated with flowers swarming with bees
     saw you, her bright face sweated and her red mouth quivered.
     O Damodara, I know truly how you churn the yogurt!”

700. “You looked at one girl
     with dark hair adorned with flowers,
     you approached another girl and your heart fell for her,
     you told another girl about her,
     you told lies to another innocent girl,
     and you embraced a curly-haired young girl,
     but you are not true to any of them.
     O you who destroyed the wrestlers
     when they came as marudu trees,
     as you grow, your magic grows with you.”

701. “Even though there is nectar-like milk
     in your mother’s breast, you crawled
     and toddled to the devil Putanā,
     put your mouth to her breasts
     and drank her poisonous milk.
     Those who saw you called you crazy.
     I am here and I love you,
     but you got together with the girl
     I sent as a messenger and enjoyed her.
     Is that also one of your naughty deeds?”

702. “I saw you wearing golden silk clothes
     as you went on the street in the dark night
     with another girl with a thin lightning-like waist.
     I stood there and saw how you looked at her
     as she looked at you,
     but you were also gesturing with your hands
     to call another girl who saw you.
     Why have you left them all and returned?
     Dear one, go back to them now.”

703. “O Vasudeva with strong heroic arms,
     did I do something to get bad karma?
     When I went to rest in the middle of the night,
     you left me on the bed alone,
     and not only that night, my dear one,
     but other nights also.
     And after you embraced young girls,
     you came back to me.
     Why did you come back and leave them?
     O dear one, get up and go to them.”

704. “O you who rest on the snake bed of Adishesha,
     we are not like the ones you knew before,
     not like those you loved
     with beautiful eyes darkened with kohl.
     Stop coming to our village and staying here.
     It is enough that we fell for you,
     looking at your beautiful clothes, divine face,
     fruit-like red lips and listening to the music of your flute.
     If we hear your lies for one day, that is enough.
     Stop saying your cheating words to attract us.
     O young one, please go away.”

705. “You asked me to come here
     but you went to the pandal blooming
     with clusters of jasmine and loved her.
     When you saw me, you muttered
     as if your heart was melting for me.
     Even though you brought a golden dress for me
     and lied that you love me before you went away,
     when you come to see me again
     I will still care for you,
     and if I see you my anger may go away.”

706. “Your chest is decorated
     with lovely, auspicious flower garlands
     and you wear peacock feathers in your hair.
     Your bright clothes are beautiful
     and your ears are adorned with a bunch of flowers.
     You played sweet music on the flute for the girls,
     with hair adorned with fragrant kongu flowers
     and flirted with them.
     Would you come and play music
     on your flute one day to enthrall us”

707. Kulasekharan, the chief of Kolli hills
     composed ten sweet Tamil pāsurams
     describing how the young cowherd girls
     fell in love with the beloved of beautiful goddess Lakshmi
     and how they expressed their wish
     to fight with him lovingly in the night.
     If devotees recite with music these ten sweet Tamil pāsurams
     of Kulasekaran, they will have no troubles in life.

Devaki's Lullaby to Krishna.

708. “You are as sweet as the sugarcane juice
     that comes from a sugarcane press, thālo.
     Your big eyes are lovely as lotuses in the water, thālo.
     Your color is like the water of the ocean, thālo.
     You are the king who killed the elephant Kuvalayābeeḍam, thālo.
     You are my son with handsome fragrant hair, thālo.
     I am more unlucky than all other mothers
     because I don’t have the good fortune
     of singing a lullaby and saying “thālo, thālo” for you.”

709. “Your lotus eyes darkened with kohl are beautiful
     as you look up and see the decorations on the cradle.
     You look like a baby cloud.
     As you bend your legs and put your fingers in your mouth,
     you look like an elephant bending its trunk and sleeping.
     O Kesava, I don’t have the good fortune
     of seeing these things when you are a baby.”

710. “Mothers from good families
     keep their children on their laps and say,
     ‘You are my dear one,
     you are the bright light of our family,
     you are like a bull that has the color of a cloud.’
     When someone asked you, ‘Who is your father?’
     you looked at Nandagopan out of the corner of your eyes
     and pointed at him with your beautiful fingers.
     Vasudevan, our chief, does not have the good fortune
     of being your father.”

711. “O Kaṇṇa, your face is like the shining full moon,
     your hands, chest and arms are strong,
     your dark hair is adorned with fresh flowers,
     your forehead is like the crescent moon
     and your eyes are like lotuses blooming in a pond.
     I do not have the fortune of seeing
     you with my eyes when you are a baby
     even though I think of myself as your mother.
     I am unlucky and I don’t have the pleasure
     of raising my child, yet still I am alive.”

712. “You kissed your father Nandagopan
     and your mother Yashoda with your beautiful lips
     as the chuṭṭi ornament on your beautiful forehead swung around.
     You put your sweet fingers into your lovely mouth
     and prattled innocently.
     When your father saw you like that
     his heart was filled with joy,
     but I did not have the good fortune of seeing those things
     or listening to your baby talk.
     Only the divine Yashoda has known that joy.”

713. “O Kaṇṇa with cool lotus eyes,
     you crawled and toddled in the cowherd village
     and you played in the red sand.
     I don’t have the good fortune of embracing you
     and covering my chest with the red sand you played in.
     When you eat your food you scatter it all over.
     I never had the good fortune of eating
     what was left over on your plate.
     Surely, my karma is bad.
     What is the use of my mother gave birth to me?”

714. “O sweet one, my lovely child, Govinda,
     babies hold on to one of their mothers’ breasts
     with their young beautiful hands
     that are as tender as shoots and drink milk.
     They look at their mother’s face and smile at them.
     I don’t have the fortune of feeding you milk like that.”

715. “You took butter with your small lotus-bud-like hands and ate it.
     When Yashoda brought a rope you were afraid she was going to hit you
     and, your beautiful mouth smeared with yogurt,
     you were scared as you looked at her and cried
     and your small red mouth trembled.
     Then you folded your hands and worshipped her
     and when she saw this, she found endless joy.”

716. “You stopped the rain with Govardhana mountain
     and protected the cows.
     You danced the beautiful kuravai dance
     and danced on a pot.
     You picked up the Rakshasas when they came as calves,
     threw them at the vilam fruit tree and killed them.
     You danced on the head of Kalingan the snake.
     I never saw how you played like this as a child—
     my heart never felt the joy of seeing these things.
     Give me your grace that I may see you play like that
     if you can do it again.”

717. “When you drank milk from the breasts of Putanā,
     the evil-hearted one, her body became withered,
     blood flowed out and her nerves were broken.
     You survived even though you drank her poisonous milk
     and gave your grace to all.
     O my father who are like a dark cloud,
     who took the life of Kamsan,
     my breasts are a burden to me and I cannot use them.
     I think I will see you one day
     and that is the only thing I am living for.
     You have a good mother, Yashoda.”

718. Kulasekharan the king of Kolli
     who bowed down with his head and worshiped Kaṇṇan
     wrote a garland of ten Tamil pāsurams
     describing how Devaki was sad not to have the fortune
     of seeing her son grow up
     who fought with Kamsan the king of Madura and killed him.
     If devotees learn and recite these fine musical Tamil pāsurams
     they will be with Naraṇan soon.

The story of Rāma—Dasharatha suffers when Rama goes to forest.

730. Dasaratha says, “You were going to become king
     as the people of this flourishing country
     bowed to your strong feet and worshipped you.
     When you were about to sit on the throne,
     O Rāma, your step-mother said,
     ‘Go and stay for a long time in the large forest.’
     I listened to the words of Kaikeyi, your mother,
     and asked you to go to the forest.
     O my dear son, that is what I did to you!”

731. Dasaratha says, “You listened to my cruel words
     and left quickly, leaving this kingdom
     with its victorious elephants, chariots and horses
     and went to the forest.
     Your lovely wife, decorated with ornaments,
     her long eyes like spears smeared with oil,
     and your younger brother Lakshmana followed you.
     How could you walk in that cruel forest?
     O our Rāma! You are my dear lord.
     What can I do?”

732. Dasaratha says, “You, with your mountain-like arms that can fight anyone,
     the son of the family of Kosalai
     whose long red-lined eyes are like murderous spears,
     know how to melt my heart.
     Before you slept on a soft bed in the palace—
     how are you going to sleep
     under the shadow of a tree in the large forest?
     How could you learn to sleep on a stone bed,
     O dark king of the dynasty of Kahustha?”

733. Dasaratha says, “Come here and go back to the forest,
     come and see me one more time before you go.
     O you who broke the bow of Shiva who rides the bull
     to marry your wife Sita
     with lovely hair decorated with flowers
     and beautiful bamboo-like arms.
     Now you are going to the wide forest
     and you make my heart suffer.
     Surely I must have done bad karma.
     My son, you are leaving,
     yet my heart does not split in two."

734. Dasaratha says, “Your soft feet will hurt
     when you walk on the gravel with stones
     as sharp as the points of the spears enemies hold,
     and they may bleed.
     Willingly you are going to the forest
     where no one wishes to go.
     The sun will be hot and hunger will cause you cruel pain.
     My son, you are going now
     because I, a sinner, listened to the evil daughter of king Kaikeyan.
     Surely I must have done bad karma. What can I do to stop you?”

735. Dasaratha says, “From now on
     I will not hear anyone lovingly calling me “amma.”
     No more will I feel the tight embrace
     of his ornamented chest on my chest.
     I cannot kiss him on his forehead,
     I will not be able to see his majestic walk
     that is like the stride of an elephant,
     I will not be able to see his lotus face anymore.
     I have lost my dear one, my son.
     Surely I have done terrible deeds, yet I am still alive.”

736. Dasaratha says, “His hair that was decorated
     with fragrant flowers is matted into jaṭa now.
     He would wear lovely, soft garments on his waist
     but now he wears orange clothes like a renunciant
     and he does not wear any ornaments.
     Is it right that my son with such handsome arms
     should go to the forest instead of me?
     O, Sumanthra, O sage Vashisṭa,
     you are learned men of the Vedas. Tell me!”

737. Dasaratha says, “O Kaikeyi,
     you have sent to the forest my divine son, as precious as gold,
     his brother Lakshmaṇa and my gentle-natured daughter-in-law
     with a waist as thin as lightning
     and words as sweet as a puvai bird’s.
     People will blame your own son Bharatha
     for what you have done
     and you are going to make me go to heaven in the sky.
     What are you going to get from all this?
     O Kaikeyi, how could you live happily in this large world?”

738. Dasaratha says, “You broke the bow
     of axe-carrying Parasurāma and destroyed his tapas.
     Without thinking how I will suffer
     and without thinking how your mother will suffer,
     you just listened to my words
     and my promise to your step-mother
     and left for the forest.
     You are my dear one.
     I wish that you could be born as my son
     for the next seven births.
     May I have that fortune,
     O king with long, strong arms.”

739. Dasaratha says, “I heard the cruel words
     of the evil Kaikeyi who followed the advice of Kuni
     and now I will leave Sumithra to suffer
     and Kosalai with hair filled with flowers that drip honey.
     You are going to the forest, leaving this rich palace happily,
     and I will leave this place
     and go to the gods’ world happily,
     O king of the dynasty of Manu.”

740. Dasharatha, adorned with garlands,
     his arms strong as mountains, suffered when his son,
     the beautiful dark Neḍumāl, went to the forest.
     Kulasekharan, the king of Kozhiyur
     who carries a sharp spear and rules under a royal umbrella
     composed ten Tamil pāsurams
     that describe the suffering of Dasharatha.
     If devotees learn these Tamil pāsurams
     they will avoid the bad paths of life.

God Rama of Thillai Chitrakuḍam.

741. Rāma, tall, with beautiful eyes,
     colored like a dark cloud,
     our dear king, our lord,
     the light that illuminates the whole world,
     stays in beautiful Ayodhya surrounded by high walls.
     Born in the dynasty of the sun,
     he brightens that royal line, and he conquered the whole sky
     and is the god of Thiruchithrakuḍam in Thillai.
     When will the day come
     when I see him joyfully with my eyes?
------

The Story of Rāma.

742. He saved the sacrifice of the rishi Vishwamithra,
     learned in all the mantras and the Vedas
     shot a strong arrow and split open the chest of Thaḍagai
     when she came to fight him, making her blood flow out,
     and he killed all the strong Rakshasas.
     See, our dear god stays in the Thiruchithrakuḍam in Thillai,
     surrounded with cool flourishing groves
     blooming with flowers with green tender leaves,
     as he sits on a throne studded with diamonds,
     praised by three thousand Andaṇars.

743. To marry Sita whose long dark lovely eyes were lined with red,
     the heroic Rāma who conquered kings with sharp spears,
     broke the bow of Shiva, the angry bull rider carrying a mazhu weapon.
     He stays in divine Chithrakuḍam in Thillai surrounded by tall walls.
     I worship the feet of the worshipers of Rāma
     whose cruel bow conquers his mighty enemies.

744. As Rāma he left his kingdom, obeying the words of Kaikeyi
     whose curly hair was decorated with bunches of fresh flowers,
     went to the forest,
     crossed the Ganges with the help of Guhan, his dear devotee,
     and gave his sandals and his kingdom to Bharathan
     when his brother came to see him.
     He stays in beautiful Chithrakuḍam in Thillai.
     If devotees see him happily with their two eyes,
     they will be equal to the gods in the sky.

745. As Rāma he killed the Rakshasa Virāḍan
     with strong mountain-like arms,
     received a bow from the sage Agasthya, creator of rich Tamil,
     cut off the nose of the beautiful Rakshasi Surpanakha,
     took the lives of Karan and Dushanan,
     and bent his bow and shot arrows to kill the Raksasa Mārisan
     when he came as a golden deer.
     He stays in Chithrakuḍam in Thillai
     and this earth is fortunate that his devotees wander there
     bowing their heads and worshiping him.

746. As Rāma he was separated from Vaidehi, his lovely wife.
     He was sad when Jaṭāyu was killed by Ravanan and sent to Vaikuṇṭam,
     he became friends with the king of monkeys' Sugrivan
     and he killed Vali in the Kishkinda forest,
     relieving the suffering of Sugrivan.
     He made Hanuman burn Lanka
     ruled by Ravaṇan, the king of the Rakshasas,
     so that Hanuman’s anger would abate.
     I worship the feet of the devotees of Rāma,
     the dear god who stays happily in Thiruchithrakuḍam in Thillai.

747. As Rāma he shot his arrows to calm the stormy ocean,
     made a bridge with the help of the monkeys
     and reached Lanka on the other side of the sea.
     He killed the Rakshasas who carried strong long spears,
     took the life of Ravaṇa the king of Lanka
     and gave the kingdom to Ravaṇa’s brother Vibhishaṇa,
     and returning to Ayodhya with his wife as lovely as Lakshmi,
     he was seated on his throne.
     I will not consider anyone my king
     except Rāma the god of Thiruchithrakuḍam in Thillai.

748. Rāma who reached Ayodhya filled with gold
     and beautiful diamond-studded palaces,
     heard his own story
     from the mouths, red as coral, of his two sons
     born to Sita, the princess of Mithila, to save the world.
     If we hear and drink in the story of Rāma
     of Thiruchithrakudam in Thillai
     we have no need of sweet nectar.

749. Rāma is adorned with a jewel-studded ornament
     given by an Andanan who knew the Vedas
     because he saved his son.
     His brother Laksmaṇa killed the Rakshasa Ilavaṇan
     and Rāma granted him moksha.
     He was separated from his brother Laksmaṇa
     by the curse of the sage Durvasa.
     If our hearts never forget the lord
     of Thiruchithrakuḍam in Thillai,
     we will not have any trouble in our lives.

750. When the dear lord adorned with garlands
     returned from the forest, the gods in the sky welcomed him.
     By the grace of him who fought with the strong Asuras
     and conquered them
     all people and creatures in the world go to Vaikuṇṭam.
     He stays always in Thiruchithrakuḍam in Thillai.
     O devotees of Rāma, praise him saying, “avan ivan!”
     and worship him always.

751. Kulasekharan, the king of Uṛaiyur,
     who rules under a royal umbrella
     and carries a victorious shining sword
     composed a garland of ten Tamil pāsurams
     describing the endless fame of Rāma,
     the son of Dasharatha and the friend of Hanumān.
     If devotees know and recite these ten sweet Tamil pāsurams
     they will approach the feet of Nāraṇan who shines with goodness.
