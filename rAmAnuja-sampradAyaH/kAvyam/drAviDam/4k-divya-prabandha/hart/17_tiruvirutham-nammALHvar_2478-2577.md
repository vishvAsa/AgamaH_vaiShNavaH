2478. The poet says,
      “O lord, chief of the gods in the sky,
      hear the request of your devotee.
      Remove my false knowledge, bad behavior,
      and unclean body and give me your grace
      so that I, born from my mother’s womb,
      will not be born in this world again.”

2479. Her friend says,
      “She loves the cloud-colored Kaṇṇan,
      the god of the gods in the sky.
      Her eyes are filled with tears,
      as if she were a fish
      frolicking in the water of a flourishing pond.
      May he prosper!”

2480. She says,
      “Worshiped by the gods, he wears a thulasi garland
      and my lovely heart goes behind him as he rides on the angry Garuḍa,
      carrying a fire-like discus that destroys his enemies.
      Nappinnai, the beautiful daughter of the cowherds who play the flute,
      the earth goddess and Lakshmi are with him like his shadow.
      Will my heart stay there looking at his beloved wives
      or will it return?”

2481. She says,
      “My lonely heart was attracted to his bird Garuḍa
      and went behind it.
      I have nothing to give to him who wears cool thulasi garlands.
      O cool poisonous wind!
      Is it right for you to blow
      and make me shiver for the love I have for him
      who drank milk from the breast of the devil Putana?”

2482. Her friend says,
      “The blowing of the cool wind is like fire,
      it doesn’t seem to know it is the cool season.
      Does he send it to make wide-eyed girls become pale?
      Does the cloud-colored Kaṇṇan
      make a rule for the wind to blow so cold?”

2483. He says,
      “This beautiful vine-like girl with sharp eyes like arrows
      and eyebrows like bent bows
      shot her arrow-look at me, her target.
      She is like the god who rides on Garuḍa,
      fought and conquered the Asurans,
      and is like Yama himself, and she is like his son Kama the god of love.
      Her love will take away your life.
      Protect yourselves.”

2484. She says,
      “The wind blows, the rain pours down
      and the clouds look like bulls fighting together.
      The earth is cool and the sky has the dark color of Thirumāl.
      Is this the rainy season that comes
      to make lovers suffer in separation?
      I don’t know. I have done bad karma.”

2485. She says,
      “All that I see and hear reminds me of my beloved,
      the chief of the mountain.
      I know that he wants to go far away,
      crossing the large mountain of Thiruvenkaṭam,
      to earn wealth, and it seems certain he will go.”

2486. He says,
      “Her face is like a lotus.
      She has shining dark eyes and lovely lips,
      her teeth are like white pearls,
      her eyes are like beautiful blooming kuvaḷai flowers
      and she looks like a beautiful doe.
      She is divine like the sky world of the god
      with a strong sharp discus in his hand.
      Who could bear to be separated from her,
      as lovely as a precious flourishing creeper?”

2487. He says,
      “O girls, you are as beautiful as the vines
      in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills in the north where Māyon stays.
      Even though I tell you how I suffer, you don’t listen.
      Are your mouths as beautiful as thoṇḍai fruit?
      Are you worried that if you speak,
      the parrots that hear you will feel shy?
      Tell me, I have done bad karma.”

2488. He says,
      “When I told her whose teeth are like white pearls,
      ‘You are like Kaṇṇan’s heaven.
      You eyes are very special.
      I need to be apart from you so I can gather wealth,’
      her large eyes like kendai fish shed tears
      and her precious golden body became pale.
      Now, all these things keep appearing
      and disappearing before me, making me suffer.”

2489. She says,
      “The pale color of my body increases.
      The nights seem as long as eons.
      My dear Kaṇṇan who has a beautiful discus
      and is adorned with a cool thulasi garland
      gave me all this pain
      because his good heart loves me.”

2490. She says,
      “The sun, the king of the day,
      the ruler of the earth with his scepter,
      has set and the heat and the light have gone away.
      The king of cold and darkness has come to rule.
      The cool wind coming from the thulasi garland
      of my beloved makes my bangles grow loose.
      Who will protect me? The night grows like an eon.”

2491. He says,
      “Her beautiful fish-shaped eyes that are sharp like spears
      have taken over my life.
      The bright light of Kama’s divine arrows
      will not leave me. They target my life.
      She is like the divine heaven
      of the shining dark-colored god.”

2492. Her friend says,
      “You came searching for an elephant and said to us,
      ‘You with fish-shaped eyes, did you see an elephant?’
      If others find out that you came here, won’t they gossip?
      We guard the millet field in Thiruvenkaṭam
      of the lord colored like the ocean or a cloud.
      You haven’t come for a while—
      every day for a long time we have guarded the millet field.”

2493. He says,
      “You are as precious as the sky where Kaṇṇan stays.
      When I am away from you, it seems as if many eons pass,
      but the time I am with you seems very short.
      Whether you are with me or away from me,
      I become weak.
      This darkness gives me much pain.”

2494. She says,
      “O ocean! You look like the darkness that is spreading.
      May you prosper with your abundant waves.
      The dark-colored lord resting on the snake bed Adisesha
      shines like a black sun that spreads its rays and take away the darkness.
      Do not erase the tracks of the wheels of the chariot on which my beloved rides.”

2495. Her friend says,
      “Does the sky look
      as if it has taken its water from the ocean and risen,
      or does the ocean look as if it has the color of the sky?
      Is it the time of the eon when the flood comes
      and he swallows all the worlds and the sky,
      or it is just the rainy season?
      The tears this girl sheds are like a waterfall.”

2496. Her mother says,
      “The dark clouds rise in the rainy season
      and their thunder seems to scream out,
      ‘Is there anyone to protect the chastity of these women?’
      If the lord adorned with a thulasi garland and riding on Garuḍa
      does not give his grace soon enough,
      the village will gossip about my little daughter
      whose words are few.”

2497. Her friend says,
      “O Velan! She is not sick because her words are few.
      Her sickness is not one that some young god has given—
      it is only because she has fallen in love with our lord.
      O Velan, stop your worship.
      O mothers, hear my words.
      Bring the cool thulasi garland from him
      who swallowed all the seven worlds and put it on her.”

2498. Her friend says,
      “The gods in the sky bathe you in pure water,
      adorn you with beautiful garlands
      and burn incense to you and worship you.
      You stole the butter in the cowherd village and ate it,
      and you fought the seven bulls with bent horns
      to marry Nappinnai, the daughter of the cowherd
      and you danced the kuḍakkuthu dance.”

2499. Her friend says,
      “He wears a dress made of leaves
      and in his hands he carries a bow and an arrow.
      It seems he has come to hunt.
      He asked us, ‘Did you see an elephant?’
      He rides on Garuda and is a thief.
      He asks things he can’t ask at his house.
      Did our relatives tell us to go to the millet field
      to answer naughty questions like this?”

2500. He says,
      “I have done bad karma.
      My mind thinks of the millet field
      where she is and the path to go there.
      O girls watching the millet field,
      are you like goddesses in the sky
      where the lotus-eyed Kaṇṇan stays?
      Tell me, what are your divine qualities?”

2501. Her mother says,
      “Her beautiful fish-eyes shed tears like a river.
      Does she suffer with love sickness?
      She wants the garland of him
      who rides on Garuḍa adorned with a thulasi garland dripping with honey
      and carried Govardhana mountain as an umbrella,
      to protect the cows and the cowherds from the big storm.
      What will become of the heart of my daughter ornamented with lovely bangles?”

2502. She says,
      “My bangles grow loose because I love the lord
      the god of the gods and the god of Indra, the king of the gods.
      His scepter that protects the sky and the earth
      is bent because he does not want to help me.
      I worry about the pain that his thulasi garland
      may give to those who love him like me on this earth”

2503. He says,
      “The sun travels through all lands
      and makes this desert so hot that no one can live here.
      You, precious as gold,
      have crossed into even this hot land with me.
      Let us go to the temple in Thiruvekka
      where the gods in the sky come to worship Kaṇṇan.
      The beautiful, blooming grove near the temple
      will take away our weariness
      and make us feel good in this desert land.”

2504. She says,
      “The world says,
      ‘If someone receives the grace of the ruler, the protector of the world,
      even enemies will become his friend.’ This is true.
      I received the cool thulasi garland of Kaṇṇan and wear it,
      and now even the cold wind that would blow like whistling fire
      in the middle of every night makes me cool.”

2505. She says,
      “In Srirangam where you stay,
      the Kaviri flows with abundant water.
      There birds look to catch crabs
      and the flowing water stops them and saves the crabs.
      We want your cool thulasi garland
      and are distressed that we do not have it.
      The cool wind blows and makes us suffer more
      and no one can escape from worry when their thoughts wander.
      Give us your grace.”

2506. She says,
      “O swans that were born in good families,
      go with your mates to the dark-colored lord
      who shines like lightning and tell him,
      ‘We are her messengers.
      She begged us to tell you how she loves you.’
      Women do not go as messengers.
      Aren’t you the right ones to go for me?”

2507. She says,
      “O swans and bees, I bow to you
      and ask you to take my message to him.
      Tell me, won’t you go to him? I won’t forget your help.
      If you see other women Kaṇṇan loves
      in Vaikuṇḍam tell them also about me.
      Understand that helping me is the right thing for you to do.”

2508. She says,
      “O clouds floating in the sky with shining lightning
      over hills as beautiful as pure gold studded with jewels,
      You are going towards the place where he is
      in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills that are known everywhere.
      If I ask you to be my messengers, will you agree?
      If I ask you to fly over me,
      will you do that and go to see him?”

2509. She says,
      “O clouds, tell me, how did you get the good fortune
      of having the color of the divine Thirumāl?
      Did you do tapas to receive the grace of him who gives life to all?
      Dark and filled with water,
      you give rain to the world and make it flourish.”

2510. Her friend says,
      “You rest on Adishesa on the ocean
      and rule this world with a scepter and your divine discus
      and you take away the bad karma of the world
      and the wide sky and give your grace to all.
      Are you ignoring her, thinking she is just a woman?
      Do you think she is a stranger?
      We cannot understand what you are thinking,
      but we see her growing pale and her beauty being spoiled.”

2511. Her friend says,
      “You are our Thirumāl.
      Upset, she kicks and erases the kuḍal she drew on the sand
      because it will not come together.
      She loves you and wants your thulasi garland.
      I don’t know how to help her and keep her from worrying so.”

2512. She says,
      “The evening, the woman of the west,
      feels alone after the sun, her husband, has left
      as she holds in her lap the moon, her son,
      whose mouth is filled with milk.
      The cool wind blows strong as if it wants to take away
      all the grace that Thirumāl who measured the world
      gives to those who long for his thulasi garland."

2513. Her friend says,
      “The night is getting dark
      and the world looks as if the end of the eon had arrived.
      She always prattles, saying, ‘cool thulasi garland,’
      but our father who destroyed the forts in Lanka
      surrounded with tall palaces
      does not feel sorry for her suffering.
      How could he be so cruel to her?”

2514. Her mother says,
      “Hunters live with arrows that kill animals
      in the forest where my daughter went with him,
      and there are other thieves there who steal cows.
      Young people there beat their loud drums.
      I have done bad karma.
      My soft-waisted daughter, beautiful as a doe,
      has gone away with Kaṇṇan, worshiping his lotus feet.
      How could she walk with him in the terrible forest?”

2515. She says,
      “Did the neelam flowers do long tapas
      as they grew in ponds with their strong stalks?
      Is that why they have the color of him, the dancer on the pot
      who measured the world and the sky at Mahābali’s sacrifice?”

2516. She says,
      “The dark-colored one , the protector
      of good people and of the gods in the sky,
      rules the sky and the world
      surrounded by the ocean rolling with waves.
      The lotuses that bloom in the ponds
      on the dark hills look like the lord
      with a dark body and lotus eyes.”

2517. She says to her friends,
      “O you ornamented with beautiful jewels!
      The sun that is like a beautiful white elephant
      sets in the evening and darkness appears like a herd of elephants.
      When will the day come when my mothers
      bring the thulasi garland of the beloved of the earth goddess
      and put it on me to make me happy?”

2518. She says,
      “The terrible wind does not stop blowing.
      There is so much heat, I don’t know what to do.
      He who rides on Garuda and destroyed the Asuras
      does not give his grace to me.
      People gossip in the mandram in the village
      and the cruel wind burns me.”

2519. She says,
      “He grew to the sky as if to say,
      ‘The distance between the sky and the earth is too small for me.’
      My eyes that worship his feet
      are like the soft lotuses in a pond waving in a strong wind.”

2520. She says,
      “His eyes and hands are like beautiful lotuses
      and he has the color of a dark mountain.
      Even the sages who know everything,
      the gods in the sky and all others
      cannot describe his beautiful color.”

2521. She says,
      “The sages and the scholars of religions
      who try to find the paths of dharma may say,
      ‘This is the color, beauty, name and form of the highest lord,’
      but he is only the light of wisdom
      and no one really knows who he is,
      or what his greatness is.”

2522. She says,
      “He gives his grace to us with his lotus eyes.
      Is there anyone who can help us as he can
      or any friend like him?
      The bond between him and us is forever—
      he is with us and we will have no trouble.
      O heart, do not worry! Worship him and live.
      O ignorant heart, only he can remove our births.”

2523. She says,
      “I thought my mind was my own
      and there was no one closer to me than my own heart.
      I thought my heart would help me
      if I sent it as a messenger to him
      who split open the chest of Hiraṇyan,
      but it went to him and stayed.
      It doesn’t want to come back
      but wanders sweetly with him.”

2524. Her mother says,
      “My daughter fell in love with Kaṇṇan.
      The wind from the north blows always and makes her suffer,
      the moon pours down its rays and makes her hot
      and her conch bangles grow loose.
      She longs for his cool thulasi garland
      and her body grows pale
      because he hasn’t given it to her.
      What will happen to my gentle daughter?”

2525. She says,
      “How can a worm moving so slowly with its soft body ever get to see the world?
      I am just like that worm waiting to see him.
      People have long believed that lizards can tell the future,
      and this lizard tells me
      that the beloved of Lakshmi will come to see me soon.
      I hope that is true.”

2526. She says,
      “O friend with a shining forehead,
      the dark-colored lord who wears thulasi garlands that swarm with bees
      is Madhusudhanan, he is Damodharan.
      I have not seen, heard or known
      a darkness like the color of his body
      that eclipses even the darkness of the night.
      But it is not only his dark body—
      this darkness of the night also makes me suffer.”

2527. He says,
      “O charioteer, drive swiftly. Don’t go slow.
      I must go and see my beloved with shining forehead
      before her pallor increases.
      We should go to the wide Thiruvenkaṭam hills
      of the god of gods in the sky
      where a waterfall shines like the pearl garland.
      and falls to the ground.

2528. She says,
      “He, Māyappirān, churned the milky ocean using Mandara mountain
      for a churning stick and the snake Vasuki for a rope
      and he gave to the gods the nectar that came up.
      The conch bangles I bought from the fishermen are becoming loose.
      Does the ocean want to have them back because they belong to it?”

2529. She says,
      “The rain goddess takes the white waves of the dark ocean
      and goes to him as he rests on a snake bed with Lakshmi.
      The waterfalls make the hills
      look like the breast of earth goddess
      and then as they flow into rivers
      it looks as if she were shedding tears and saying,
      ‘Tirumal is cruel!’”

2530. The fortuneteller says,
      “She fell in love with the god of the gods in the sky
      and is sick with love for him.
      Bring a thulasi garland or a leaf from it
      or a beautiful branch of the plant or its root
      and fan her with it.”

2531. Sending bees as messengers, she says,
      “O bees, it is easy for you to fly to the sky where he is.
      Before you go to see him,
      make sure you remember clearly the message that I give you.
      Go to his faultless lotus feet and tell him.
      The cowherd women scolded him
      because he stole their butter and ate it,
      but I won’t say anything like that.
      Help me reach his faultless feet.”

2532. He says,
      “O bees! Come. You drink honey from the beautiful flowers
      that bloom on the water, on the earth
      and in the trees, and you feel happy and fly about.
      I want to tell you something.
      She is like the Vaikuṇḍam of him who took the form of a boar.
      You drink honey from the fragrant flowers on her hair.
      Have you ever seen such flowers anywhere else?”

2533. She says,
      “O friend! Through the divine grace of him
      who swallowed the whole earth and spit it out
      we have a place to live.
      We are not afraid of anything.
      The cool breeze brings honey
      from his beautiful thulasi garland and sprinkles it
      on my body and my ornaments.
      No one around me knows this.
      I am happy.”

2534. He says,
      “Her face is like a lotus,
      her eyes are like beautiful kendai fish or sharp spears,
      her nose is like a vine
      and she wears earrings in her ears.
      When our eyes met we felt as if we had drunk
      the nectar from the milky ocean churned up by the gods.
      No one will gossip about us—our love is true.”

2535. Her friend says,
      “When he took the boon from Mahābali,
      one foot covered the whole world
      and the other foot had to go to sky
      since there is no space left on the earth.
      He is the highest lord of the world and the sky
      and he is the light of knowledge.
      There is nothing left anywhere
      for the lotus-eyed Kaṇṇan to measure.”

2536. Her foster mother says,
      “She longs for the thulasi garland
      of Madhusudanan, the lord of flourishing world,
      and she, her lovely teeth like jasmine, cannot bear the pain
      of the night that seems as long as an eon.
      My daughter’s round breasts have grown pale.
      I have done bad karma.”

2537. Her mother says,
      “My daughter’s breasts have not grown out yet,
      her hair is not yet thick
      and she doesn’t know how to put her clothes on.
      She only prattles.
      Her bright, mesmerizing glance is precious beyond any price.
      She only knows to say, ‘Is he the highest lord?
      Is Thiruvenkaṭam the hill where he stays?’”

2538. Her friend says,
      “O friend, how can we praise his might?
      He is the highest and most ancient god of the gods in the sky
      and all in the sky worship him.
      He measured the whole earth and the sky with his two feet
      without growing tired,
      yet he came to the cowherd village
      and was born as a baby there.”

2539. Her friend says,
      “You have the color of a cloud
      and you rest on a snake bed on the ocean.
      Even if she worships the ocean and asks it to be calm,
      it just roars out, ‘aṟaiyoo!’
      Her chastity cannot be saved without your divine grace.
      Is this right, O lord?”

2540. She says,
      “He has a wonderful color
      and his cool beautiful eyes shine
      like lotuses blooming in the ponds in the sky.
      I love the divine presence of Kaṇṇan, Thirumāl—
      my heart thinks of him constantly without stopping.”

2541. She says
      “The Vediyars are like the gods in the sky
      as they worship him reciting the mantras of the Vedas.
      I blame myself for my bad karma and try to join him.
      I have learned his divine names and recite them
      but I am like someone who bites into a bitter unripe fruit
      because he cannot get a ripe one.”

2542. He says,
      “Her flower eyes, more beautiful than a doe’s,
      seem to talk to her ears.
      She worships the feet of the god
      who swallowed the whole world and spit it out.
      Her divine eyes swallow me.”

2543. He says,
      “O friend, She is divine like the Vaikuṇṭam
      of our god who is fire, water, wind, sky and earth.
      Her eyes like kāvi flowers are my life.
      Like the yogis who do not eat, sleep or have feelings
      and put their minds only on god,
      my thoughts are only on her.”

2544. He says,
      “She is like a swan with soft wings living in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills
      where Mādhavan Govindan stays who rides on Garuḍa,
      and conquered the Asurans.
      Her eyes are like kāvi flowers, neelam flowers, spears and fish
      and they are mighty enough to take away my life.
      She is like a soft-feathered swan.”

2545. He says,
      “You are like Vaikuṇṭam of the god
      who measured the earth surrounded with oceans.
      Kondrai trees have begun to bloom
      even though the rainy season has not arrived—
      they seem to be inviting the rainy season
      with their branches where long golden flowers hang.”

2546. Her friend says,
      “O you with your young breasts tied with a band,
      don’t worry that even though night has arrived like a dark bull
      he has not come.
      He went to Mahābali’s sacrifice and took over the whole world—
      Won’t he give his grace to you? Don’t worry.
      You will not lose your bangles.”

2547. She says to her friend.
      “I long for the fragrant thulasi garland that is on the head
      of the lord of the sky with a discus—
      it will take away my pallor.
      The darkness of night increases always for me
      whether it is one day, one month,
      one year or a thousand eons and makes me suffer.”

2548. She says,
      “O friend, I have never said
      that he swallowed all the seven worlds at the end of the eon.
      I saw the kaḷām fruit and said only it has the color of the ocean.
      My mother heard and said,
      ‘She says this fruit has his color
      who swallowed all the seven worlds.’
      O friends, my mother thinks that I think of his color.”

2549. She says,
      “The crescent moon that splits the darkness surrounding the world
      increases the pain of my love.
      I am alone and my heart grows weak
      longing for his thulasi garland.
      The pale color of my body increases.
      How can I survive with this bright moon?”

2550. Her friend says,
      “The white moon shines with milk-like rays
      in the sky in the evening.
      She suffers alone and her beloved,
      the lord with the heroic discus,
      the protector of all the seven worlds,
      has not come to give his grace.
      How could he not give his grace to her?”

2551. She says,
      “He knows everything in the world,
      and he rests on his snake bed on the milky ocean
      rolling with waves that come and go.
      He swallowed all the worlds at the end of the eon.
      and he carried Govardhana mountain
      to protect the cows and the cowherds.
      The fresh breeze that blows through his thulasi garland
      comes and blows on me.”

2552. He says,
      “You have a shining face
      and your eyes that are like keṇḍai fish spear through my heart.
      Our lord rests on Adisesha on the ocean where conches roam and the smell of fish spreads.
      Do you live in Vaikuṇṭam
      where he lives, worshiped by the gods in the sky?”

2553. She says,
      “O innocent heart,
      you yearn for the beautiful cool thulasi garland of the lord
      who grew tall and measured the earth and the sky.
      He makes the bright moon rise in the evening
      when lovely lotuses close and soft ambal flowers open.
      It is strange that my love for him
      makes my conch bangles loose.”

2554. She says,
      “Evening has come
      and the sun, the king of the day, sets after ruling the world
      and the crescent moon rises slowly.
      The thulasi garland of the god of the gods in the sky
      who fought with the Raksasas in southern Lanka and destroyed them
      appears before me, makes me pallid and hurts me.”

2555. She says,
      “I cannot describe the strength and ability
      of the dark mountain-like lord who fought Vānāsuran
      and cut off his thousand strong arms.
      My innocent heart went to fetch his beautiful thulasi garland
      and has not returned—
      I am left only with the pain of my love.”

2556. She says,
      “The Vedas praise the lord
      whose chest is adorned with a white thread.
      The gods in the sky praise the endless one
      who swallowed all the worlds at the end of the eon
      and rests on Adisesha on the ocean.
      Devotees of the whole world worship the god Sridharan,
      and they are higher than the gods in the sky for me.”

2557. She says,
      “The sun sets like the kings who ruled the world
      with their scepters for a time and disappeared.
      You measured the world and you are the king of the sky.
      Now, the darkness grows and gives us pain.
      Do not leave us. Give us your grace.”

2558. Her friend says,
      “Don’t her mothers know what is happening to her?
      They don’t know and they call the Velan to find out.
      Didn’t they give birth to her?
      Isn’t there anyone who knows
      how to decorate her hair with a thulasi garland
      and take her to the Thiruvengaṭam hills?
      That is what she needs.
      She is growing weak, suffering from the fire of love.”

2559. She says,
      “His eyes shine like two burning suns
      rising from the tops of the hills
      and they destroy and burn the Asurans.
      Tell me, how is it that they burn us?
      He protects the whole world—
      he should not be hurting us like this.
      Tell us, is this what he does to all the world?”

2560. Her friend says,
      “The male andril living in the cage on the palm tree calls his mate
      and his cooing is like the viḷari raga.
      My friend hears that and her life and body grow weak
      and she continuously speaks his name.
      I don’t know how she will survive.”

2561. She says,
      “You have the color of kohl
      and you shine like a jewel.
      You are a pearl. You are my diamond.
      O dear one, I want to see you
      among the beautiful girls at the festivals
      holding your white conch
      and golden discus in your hands.”

2562. She says,
      “The evening has arrived and the pure golden sun sets
      like a diamond that a monkey has thrown down on the hill.
      You are a diamond and you measured the world.
      You are my emerald,
      my matchless precious gold, my refuge.
      I am apart from you in this evening.”

2563. She says,
      “The lord with a discus and a conch
      helped Shiva when Brahma’s skull
      was stuck to his hands and made it fall off.
      When he stole butter Yashoda tied him
      with rough ropes and beat him.
      What can I say?
      I can only prattle on praising my dear lord.”

2564. Her friend says,
      “The voice of the andril bird calling his mate
      and the sound of the ocean flowing
      with roaring waves in the backwaters
      increase her lovesickness.
      O Thirumāl, all these sounds make her suffer.
      The world sees her suffering in love and gossips about her.
      Is this how you play?”

2565. She says,
      “Meru mountain has a form like Thirumāl
      and the bright sun is like the divine discus in his beautiful hands.
      I have not seen his form or his discus,
      but I prattle on as if I had seen him.
      He has given his grace to me, his devotee,
      and I will not experience the results of my bad karma.”

2566. She says,
      “When will I reach the lord, the beloved of Lakshmi,
      nectar for those who have done good karma
      and the destroyer of their bad karma?
      Even though he only grazed the cows,
      he is strong as a bull,
      and he measured the world and the sky
      with his two feet in ancient times.”

2567. She says,
      “I was born to worship you
      whose discus destroyed the clan of Asuras.
      I can only serve you with this body,
      but I cannot reach your feet in this illusory birth.
      I have been on this earth a long time,
      O father, but I cannot reach you.”

2568. She says,
      “Like a thief the mischievous lord
      stole butter from uṟi that was tied high on the wall,
      swallowed all the earth in his stomach,
      and went to Mahābali’s sacrifice as a dwarf
      and asked for three feet of land.
      I am his slave.
      My heart doesn’t want to love anyone but him.”

2569. She says,
      “The gods in the sky
      worshiped your feet in the morning and evening.
      and asked you to burn Lanka, the land of the evil Raksasas.
      Did they worship you just to see you as Rama,
      one of your many forms?”

2570. She says,
      “In the morning when the hot sun arrives
      the wicked darkness runs away
      and then comes back to spread in the evening.
      The wise sages who worship the lord
      closing their eyes and meditating
      do not need to recite his praise or think of his dark form.”

2571. His friend says,
      “Only Vediyars are fit to worship your dark body,
      with beautiful lotus eyes and divine feet.
      The cows that return home in the evening
      will call when they come near their stall
      and the blind cow will call and follow their calling.
      Just like them I, your slave, praise you with words.
      I have not seen you. What else can I do?”

2572. She says,
      “The soul comes to this earth, enters a body, lives
      and when the body grows old, it suffers and leaves this world.
      I don’t want to be born—I want to be always with him.
      I want to find some tapas that will take me to moksha
      and remove the results of my karma.
      He is my mother and father and can give me moksha—
      I worship him to reach him.”

2573. She says,
      “You created many yugas, many gods and many religions,
      and wise people worship the gods of those religions
      and follow their teachings.
      There is no other god like you.
      If my mother calls the Velan and asks him about me,
      I will not perform the rituals he asks me to do.
      My love for you is the only true thing
      and I will worship only you.”

2574. She says,
      “I have fallen in love with the lord
      surrounded by many gods happily worshiping him
      and for many days haven’t slept
      as I have seen the sun rise and set.
      Many eons have passed like this.
      How could those who fall in love with Thirumāl
      close their eyes and sleep?”

2575. Her friend says,
      “All the gods in the sky
      and the sages and others who do not sleep
      worship our matchless, omnipotent god.
      He will remove their future births.
      How can anyone understand how one so divine
      could steal butter and eat it? Is it his magic?”

2576. She says,
      “People know that I am in love with him
      who became a boar and brought the earth goddess
      from the underworld at the end of the eon.
      Let them gossip about me with mean words—
      it doesn’t matter to me.
      For Indra of the karpaga garden and the other gods
      there is no other wise god like him.
      I have not known any good thing but him.”

2577. The poet says,
      “Māran from Thirukkuruhur where good people live
      composed a garland of a hundred pasurams
      on the divine name of Thirumāl.
      If devotees learn and recite these pasurams
      they will not have the results of their bad karma
      and will not be born in the mire that is this false earth.
