    Praising the god

2578. O lord, with red garments,
      your crown is the sun that spreads bright rays
      and the beautiful moon floats above your head.
      Your mouth is as lovely as coral
      and you shine like a light and an emerald hill.
      You are adorned with golden clothes
      and many precious ornaments
      and your mouth and eyes shine,
      adding to the luster of your dark body.
      You rest on thousand-headed Adisesha
      in the middle of ocean with rolling waves
      as Shiva, Nānmuhan who stays on a lotus on your navel, Indra
      and all the crowd of gods worship you.
      O lord, you measured all the three worlds
      with your divine feet.

2579. You, our father, created the world and swallowed it.
      My heart longs to worship your shining lotus feet
      ornamented with sounding anklets, melting to receive you.
      My love for you flows like sweet nectar.
      Some people wish only for material things,
      never thinking of being your devotee—
      let them do whatever they want.
      The nature of this illusionary world is to become rich.
      Even if someone gets everything he needs in this world
      and excellent moksha, the wise will not want a worldly life.
      Their only aim will be to reach your feet.

2580. He, the first one of the three gods,
      with shining jewels on his chest, rules all the three worlds,
      leading them on a good path.
      He churned the milky ocean using Mandara mountain
      for a churning stick and the snake Vasuki for a rope,
      and as the ocean was churned,
      it roared with a a loud noise like thunder as its waves rolled.
      May we serve the devotees of the matchless god
      continuously, eon after eon.

2581. Will he accept us as his devotees in all the eons
      so that we may worship him?
      At the time of terrible flood
      when there was no world and no people, X
      he, the seed from which everything came,
      the only god at the end of the eon,
      created Nānmuhan from his navel on a lotus,
      and Nānmuhan created three-eyed Shiva
      and the other gods and all the three worlds.
      Let us worship the feet of Māyan.

2582. Your eyes are like lotuses blooming in a forest,
      your mouth is as sweet as a fruit,
      your feet are like a thousand suns shining together
      and your thousand divine arms
      are like many flourishing forests of the karpaga garden.
      When you put one foot on the earth and measured the whole world
      and raised your other shining lotus foot to the sky and measured it,
      the world created by Nānmuhan was amazed and pleased
      and the gods in the sky performed their worship.
      O Thirumāl! Can anyone measure the world
      with their feet like this except you ?

2583. Is this the nature of this world?
      Some ignorant people worship small gods
      and it is if they were worshiping a wooden plank
      when they have a mother who gave birth to them.
      When they have their own ancient first god
      who created, split open, and measured the earth,
      giving them his grace,
      they do not worship him but they worship small gods
      thinking that they are the real gods.
      They offer them meat and then eat it
      and do many wrong things,
      worshiping in a way that will give them only sorrow.
      As they enjoy their lives,
      they are involved in the illusions of this world,
      only to be born again and suffer again in life.

2584. Shiva with the crescent moon in his matted hair,
      Nānmuhan, Indra, the gods in the sky
      and all the creatures of the world worship him.
      At the end of the eon he swallowed the earth, ocean, fire, wind, sun,
      moon, the sky and all other flourishing
      and shining things in the world
      and kept them in his stomach
      as he, the divine Māyan, rested on a banyan leaf.
      Is there any other god who is more divine for us to worship?

Thiruvāsiriyam. murrum.
