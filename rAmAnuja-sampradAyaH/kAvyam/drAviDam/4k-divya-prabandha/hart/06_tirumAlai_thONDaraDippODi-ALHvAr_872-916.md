+++

872. You, the ancient one,
     swallowed the three worlds and spit them out.
     We do not like the feeling
     that come from the enjoyment of our five senses
     and we do not sin anymore.
     The messengers of Yama cannot hurt us now.
     We are brave because we have learned your names
     and recite them, O god of Srirangam.

873. Your body is like a beautiful green hill,
     your lotus eyes are handsome
     and your mouth is red as coral.
     O father, bull among the gods
     and tender child of the cowherds,
     I want only to praise you with these words.
     I do not want anything
     even if it were the gift of ruling Indra’s world,
     O god of Srirangam.

874. Even if a man lives for hundred years,
     half of those years he spends resting.
     Many he spends as an innocent child and as a youth
     and the rest he spends suffering sickness, hunger,
     old age and other ills.
     I do not want to be born any more in this world,
     O god of Srirangam.

875. When Kstrabandu suffered from bad karma,
     he worshipped the god,
     recited the three syllables of the word “Govinda”
     and received moksha
     but even though I continually worship Rangan,
     the crazy god who gave his grace to devotees like Ksatrabandu,
     he has not taken away my births.

876. If people enjoy the pleasures of women
     they will fall into many troubles.
     They will get sick and suffer, unable to eat night and day.
     Why do those base ones not become the devotees
     of the god whose chest is adorned with cool thulasi garlands,
     singing and dancing his praise?
     They only enjoy the food they eat and do not realize
     that worshiping the god is like drinking nectar.

877. You build tall walls for your palaces
     that have long porches and enjoy living in them
     and you do not think at all of your next birth.
     You do not become a devotee of the god Rangan
     whose walls are dharma.
     You decorate the exterior wall that is your body
     and live inside it as if you were a bird
     concerned with nothing else.

878. If people learn the good religious books,
     how can they hear, see and learn
     about the dharma of the mean religions, Buddhism and Jainism?
     If I think of any other god,
     I promise that even if someone cuts off my head
     I will not die because I am a devotee of the god.
     The only god of gods destroyed Lanka with his bow.

879. O god of Srirangam,
     the bald-headed Jains, Buddhists and the Sakyas
     hate our religion and say terrible things about you.
     It is better if they get sick and die rather than living.
     When I hear their evil speech, it hurts me.
     If I could, I would cut off their heads.

880. O ignorant men! Is there any other god?
     You will not understand that he is the only god
     unless you are in trouble.
     You should know one thing for sure:
     there is no god except him.
     Worship the ankleted feet of our father
     who grazed the calves.

881. He created all the gods by his good grace
     and showed Srirangam as the path
     to those wishing to be released from their births.
     O Nambis, listen.
     The god riding the eagle is here,
     but you look only for the wealth that is achieved by bad deeds.

882. Our god, the protector of the world,
     built a bridge on the large ocean, shooting one arrow,
     and he fought with the king of the Rakshasas in Lanka.
     You do not think of the beautiful temple
     in Srirangam surrounded by forts,
     and so you do not have good luck in this birth but waste your life.

883. Once some people heard
     Yama and Muthkalan talking together in hell
     and thought that hell is heaven.
     They forgot that the place of the many-named dear god Nambi
     is Srirangam and they did not worship the god there.
     They plunged into sorrow and I am worried
     that they will have trouble in their lives.

884. All the creatures of this wide earth
     surrounded by oceans with rolling waves
     worship the king of the gods in the sky
     adorned with a fragrant blooming thulasi garland.
     If ignorant people praise Srirangam,
     all the hells that have been created for them
     because of their enjoyment of the senses
     will be destroyed and disappear.

885. Beautiful Srirangam is surrounded with groves
     where bunches of bees swarm around flowers, peacocks dance,
     clouds float above in the sky and cuckoos sing.
     Indra the king of the gods comes and stays there.
     Such is lovely Srirangam.
     You should take the food that the evil people eat
     who do not praise Srirangam filled with beautiful groves
     and give it to the dogs.

886. The king of the gods with an eagle flag
     is true for people if they think he is true
     and he is false if they think he is not true.
     If someone thinks he can escape birth
     only by worshiping the god,
     his doubts about the god will go away
     and he will understand
     that Srirangam is the Thirupadi of the beautiful god.

887. I was a gambler and a thief.
     I consorted with bad people
     and was caught in the love-nets of fish-eyed women.
     But the beautiful god said, “Come out!”
     and entered my mind and made me love him.
     Srirangam is the Thirupadi of the beautiful god
     who made me love him.

888. I don’t know how to praise you with my tongue
     and I don’t have the good luck of knowing how to love you
     or a good mind that knows how to glorify you.
     My strong iron-like heart melted
     to see the sweet sugarcane-like god
     of the wonderful temple in Srirangam
     surrounded with groves swarming with bees.
     How my eyes were delighted when I saw him!

889. My lotus-eyed god
     rules the world, resting on the ocean
     where waves break on the banks
     and spray drops of water with foam.
     My eyes that saw Kaṇṇan
     with a red mouth as soft as a fruit shed tears.
     What can I, a sinner, do?

890. My father, the blue ocean-colored lord,
     rests on the snake bed,
     and as he rests his head is on the west side,
     his feet are extended toward the east,
     his back is turned toward the north
     and he looks toward Lanka in the south.
     When I look at him as he rests my body melts.
     O people of the world, what can I do?

891. The Māyanār who rests on a snake bed
     in Srirangam where the water of the Kaviri flows over its banks,
     has a beautiful divine chest,
     strong arms, pure lotus eyes,
     lovely coral lips and shining hair
     and his body has the color of an emerald.
     How could his devotees forget his beautiful form?

892. O heart, you are humble
     and you want me to make my mind one
     with Rangan, whose mouth is red as coral.
     You are strong and tell me
     that I should always think of the god, beautiful as a jewel,
     resting in the mountain-like temple of beautiful, precious gold.
     Tell me how can I approach him?

893. O heart, you may speak of him
     but you cannot really know his greatness.
     No one can know him unless they are faultless.
     We can only worship him
     who stays in the hearts of his faultless devotees.
     O ignorant heart, can you speak of him? Tell me.

894. Srirangam is in the middle of the Kaveri river
     which is purer than the Ganges.
     and its water rises and spreads through blooming groves.
     Our dear Thirumāl, our Esan, rests there on the river.
     How can I live forgetting him
     after seeing him resting on the water of the Kaveri?
     I am to be pitied, I am to be pitied.

895. I see his beautiful lotus face
     and I see how that thief who stole my heart
     rests on the Kaveri in Srirangam
     surrounded by a rising flood of water
     and flourishing with groves.
     O my heart, you are brave.
     You know he is the one you really love,
     but you love him secretly and spend your days
     without telling anyone.

896. I have not lived the life of an orthodox Vediyan
     bathing and making sacrifices with three fires.
     I do not understand myself
     and I am not a devotee in your eyes.
     What is there for me to be happy about?
     O Nambi colored blue like the ocean,
     I cry out for you. Show pity on me
     and give me your grace, lord of Srirangam!

897. I don’t worship your golden feet,
     decorating them constantly with flowers.
     Even though I have much time,
     I don’t praise your divine qualities with faultless words.
     My heart doesn’t know how to love you.
     O Ranga, I don’t have the fortune of being your devotee.
     What can I do? I was born in vain.

898. I am like the innocent squirrel
     that went to Rāma for refuge after rolling and immersing itself
     in the wave-filled water as it tried to help the monkeys
     when they took mountains to build the bridge for Rāma to go to Lanka.
     My heart is as hard as wood and I am a bad person.
     I have not served the lord of Srirangam with my mind
     and am tired and wretched.

899. Even the gods in the sky do not understand the radiant lord
     who came to protect the elephant Gajendra
     and grew angry at the crocodile that ate red meat.
     Am I fit for him to come to me?
     I am mean, like a dog and I have not served him.
     What can I do? I was born in vain.

900. I don’t belong to a village or own any land.
     I have no relatives.
     I worship the feet of you, the highest one, on this earth
     and know no other refuge,
     O you with the bright color of the dark clouds.
     O Kaṇṇa! I cry out for you.
     Whom do I have without you as my support?
     Come and remove my sorrow,
     you who are my mother, lord of Srirangam.

901. I don’t have a pure mind and no good words come from my mouth.
     I get very angry, shout and say bad things.
     You are adorned with fresh thulasi garlands,
     lord of Srirangam, surrounded by the Ponni river.
     Tell me, what will happen to me, O my king.

902. O lord of Srirangam,
     I have not done tapas like the sages, I am not wealthy,
     and I am as useless as salty water for my friends and relatives.
     I fell for women whose mouths are like coral
     and became like dust when I didn’t have money.
     You gave me this birth only to make me suffer.

903. O Kaṇṇan with a body as dark as a thick cloud,
     lord of beautiful Srirangam
     where bees sing and swarm in the groves,
     I don’t know even one path to take to see you.
     I am a thief, I am violent, stupid and rough.
     I come to you. You are my refuge.

904. I stopped telling the truth
     and fell into the passion of women with long hair.
     I told only lies and now I have no refuge.
     I, a liar, come and stand before you, O lord, Ranga,
     hoping that you will give me your grace.
     I am a liar, a liar.

905 Thirumāl abides in my mind
but I am unable to understand that he is there.
I am a thief disguised as a devotee doing service.
When I realized that you are in the minds of those
who think of you and you know what they think,
I was ashamed and laughed so hard
that it seemed the bones in my chest would break.

906. O my father who measured all the world with your feet,
     I, a sinner, will not worship anyone but you,
     the lovely-eyed Thirumāl, my soul, my nectar,
     my father, as dear to me as my life.
     I am a sinner, truly I am a sinner.

907. When you were young
     you carried Govardhana mountain to stop the storming rain,
     O you who are like a sweet river.
     I suffer, caught in the net of doe-eyes women—
     why don’t you look at me and give me your grace?
     I have no one but you. I call you,
     O ancient one, god of Srirangam.

908. The bright lord is my father and mother,
     the god of Srirangam
     surrounded by the clear water of the Kaviri.
     I am a poor person.
     My dear lord doesn’t show me even a little compassion,
     he doesn’t think, “He is pitiful, I should help him.”
     What is this, O lord, Isn’t this a terrible thing to do?

909. You, lord of Srirangam surrounded by water,
     are happy with devotees
     if they abandon their wealth, understand divine truth,
     know what will they be in the future,
     control their five senses, shave their heads
     and stay at your doorstep, living a quiet life.

910. O lord of Srirangam
     whose hair is decorated with a thulasi garland,
     no one has to be born in a good family to become your slave.
     Even if someone is born like a dog
     and doesn’t belong to the families of Vediyars,
     if he worships your feet ornamented with sounding anklets,
     it seems you will be happy with him,

911. O lord of Srirangam
     with beautiful Lakshmi on your chest,
     even if hunters kill animals cruelly,
     burn and eat them,
     if they think of you in their minds
     and keep you there with love, worshiping you,
     their bad karma will disappear
     and they will not suffer.

912. Even bad people who do evil things
     and make others do evil deeds,
     if they praise you saying, “You are the god of the sky.
     Even the gods in the sky do not understand you
     who are adorned with a thulasi garland
     that swarms with bees,”
     and if they become your slaves and offer food to your devotees,
     they will become pure.

913. Lord of Srirangam surrounded with walls,
     you give your grace to all who worship you, and you tell them,
     “Even if you belong to a low caste, you should recite the Vedas,
     follow a faultless way of life and become my devotee,
     mingling with other devotees, worshiping them,
     giving them whatever they need
     and sharing your things with them.”
     Isn’t that the way you give grace to poor people
     and make them worship you as your good devotees?

914. O lord of beautiful Srirangam,
     if even Vediyars of the highest caste
     who recite the six divine Upanishads and the four Vedas
     disgrace your devotees,
     they will become Pulaiyars in a moment.

915. Shiva with the Ganges in his matted hair
     and Nanmuhan who did tapas for countless ages
     could not see you and felt ashamed.
     You came and gave your grace to the elephant Ganjendra,
     amazing the gods in the sky.
     Why do people think of you as their refuge
     and hope you will remove their suffering
     when you do not show your grace to all like me?

916. Thoṇḍaraḍippoḍi, the pious devotee
     praised Kaṇṇan, Thirumāl, the god of Srirangam
     who killed the strong well-fed elephant in flourishing Madurai
     that has beautiful palaces decorated with coral.
     If devotees recite his simple pāsurams
     they will become his sweet devotees.
