1758. She says,
      “O friend,
      he, the god of the gods who taught the Vedas to the sages
      with a shining golden body
      and a chest adorned with emerald ornaments shining like lightning
      stares at me, my waist and my round young breasts.
      If mother sees, what will she do?
      I am afraid of her.
      Acho, how can I describe his beauty!”

1759. She says,
      “He rests on the ocean in Kuḍandai surrounded with water
      where blooming neelam flowers spread fragrance.
      Is he the younger brother of Balarama?
      He carries a shining discus and a conch in his hands,
      and women with soft ankleted feet worship him.
      He wears many diamonds, pearls and golden ornaments on his four arms.
      Acho, how can I describe his beauty!”

1760. She says,
      “O friend, he is magnificent and bright, like a tall hill
      with beautiful lotus eyes
      and a thousand arms adorned with shining ornaments.
      He is the god Maṇāḷar of the temple in Meyyam
      surrounded with mountains and bamboo groves.
      Acho, how can I describe his beauty
      that measured the whole world!”

1761. She says,
      “O friend, he, the young one with a fragrant thulasi garland
      swarming with bees on his chest
      and a coral mouth does not know good manners.
      He comes into our home carrying in his hands a discus and a conch
      and stays with us.
      If I try to describe his divine form,
      I can only say it is like a bundle of beautiful corals.
      Acho, how can I describe his beauty!”

1762. She says,
      “He, the cowherd with four mighty mountain-like arms
      looks like the god of the temples in Uṛaiyur and Kuḍal.
      We have not seen him before.
      Let us praise him.
      If you see him, he looks like the dark ocean
      and holds in his hands a heroic discus and a conch.
      Acho, how can I describe his beauty!”

1763. She says,
      “Did he, the king with lovely lotus eyes
      break the tusks of the angry elephant Kuvalayabeedam?
      Did he take shelter in the mind of girls adorned with ornaments?
      I don’t know him.
      Did he, the bull-like god, threaten Kamsan with his divine feet?
      When people see him,
      they wonder at his form that is like a huge black mountain
      and they worship him.
      Acho, how can I describe his beauty!”

1764. She says,
      “O friend, with eyes and hands as beautiful as lotuses
      and a dark cloud like body, he is generous
      and gives his grace to his devotees making their lotus hearts bloom.
      My heart worships him.
      I don’t understand what is happening.
      I have never seen him before.
      Acho, how can I describe his beauty!”

1765. She says,
      "He, my beloved, the god of Thirumalirunjolai
      where tall trees in the groves of Thirumalirunjolai
      touch the beautiful moon that floats on a cloud,
      came and entered my eyes and my heart and does not leave me.
      Is he the lord of Thiruneermalai?
      He looks like a dark cloud rising
      above a golden mountain where clouds float.
      He came riding on Garuda, the bird with beautiful wings.
      I don’t know who he is. Come, see him. Acho, how can I describe his beauty!”

1766. She says,
      “He swallowed everything in the eight directions,
      all the roaring oceans and the seven worlds
      and he lay on the banyan leaf happily.
      Who is this Māyan?
      I don’t know all his māyams.
      All the gods of the sky come and worship him
      who has the color of a majestic dark mountain over which clouds float.
      with eyes and a mouth that are lovely as blooming lotus buds.
      Acho, how can I describe his beauty!”

1767. The poet Kaliyan, handsome chief of Thirumangai
      surrounded with strong new walls,
      composed a garland of ten musical pāsurams with divine words
      on the god of Thirunagai
      who took the forms of a swan, a boar and a fish.
      If devotees learn and recite these poems
      they will rule the world as kings
      and go to the world of the gods and stay there happily.
