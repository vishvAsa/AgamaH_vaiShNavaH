1748. The dark ocean-colored god with a conch in his hand
      and rests on shining Adisesha on the wide ocean rolling with waves
      and created Nānmuhan on a lotus on his navel-
      stays in Thirukkaṇṇanguḍi
      where faultless Vediyars skilled in all the precious arts
      recite the six Upanishads and the four Vedas
      and perform the three sacrifices with their divine hands.

1749. When Gajendra, the elephant
      went to get flowers for the god,
      a crocodile caught his feet in the pond
      and he worshiped the lord raising his trunk and asked for help,
      and our god came, threw his heroic discus,
      killed the evil crocodile and saved him.
      The almighty god stays in Thirukkaṇṇanguḍi
      surrounded by precious palaces with jewel-studded walls
      where in the flourishing fields kuvalai flowers,
      blossoming lotuses, lovely kazuneer flowers
      and neydal flowers bloom.

1750. The almighty god who took the form of a fish
      and saved the world from the storm at the end of the eon
      when darkness covered the world
      and the sky, earth and mountains
      all plunged into the ocean rolling with waves -
      stays in Thirukkaṇṇanguḍi
      where blooming punnai trees, jasmine and alli flowers
      dripping with honey spread their fragrance
      and the lovely cool breeze blows everywhere.

1751. The lord who took the form of a boar
      with strong eyes, sharp white teeth
      and a body as large as a mountain,
      brought the earth goddess from the underworld
      and saved her from an Asuran
      and drove the chariot for the Pandavas in the battles
      stays in Thirukkaṇṇanguḍi
      surrounded by incomparable, ancient palaces
      where flags fly as the moon shines on them.

1752. The lord who went to the king Mahabali’s sacrifice as a dwarf,
      asked for three feet of land and as the king gave the land
      by pouring water on his hands,
      took a huge form that covered all the directions
      and measured the earth and the sky with his two feet-
      stays in Thirukkaṇṇanguḍi
      where swans sit on the lovely lotuses
      under the shadow of leaves in the rippling water
      fanned by the good paddy.

1753. The lord who took the form of Balaraman,
      and conquered many kings with his mazu weapon,
      crushed their crowns, made their blood flow
      and sated his anger
      stays in Thirukkaṇṇanguḍi
      where bunches of bananas,
      groups of tall kamugu and kuravu trees
      and cool mādhavi creepers bloom in the flourishing groves
      that embrace the tall beautiful palaces.

1754. When Rāvaṇa, the king of Lanka
      surrounded with oceans with rolling waves,
      afflicted the gods in the sky with his valor and conquered them,
      Rama went there to bring his wife Sita back,
      bent his bow, fought with Rāvaṇa
      and made the ten crowned heads of the king of Lanka
      fall on the earth like the fruits of palm trees.
      He stays in Thirukkaṇṇanguḍi
      where flocks of forest peacocks dance
      and the clouds roar like drums
      and the lined bees drink honey and sing sweet music.

1755. Our lord who grew high in the sky and measured the world
      went to the Kauravas’ assembly as a messenger,
      and made himself a seat and sat on it
      when Duriyodhana with a snake flag
      would not give him a place in his assembly.
      He stays in Thirukkaṇṇanguḍi
      where the waves of the river bring precious jewels,
      pearls from bamboo canes that split open, emeralds and diamonds
      and pile them all in the fields.

1756. The lord Māyan
      who drove the strong shining chariot for his in-laws
      in the Bharatha battle and destroyed their enemies
      and relieved the burden of the earth goddess -
      stays in Thirukkaṇṇanguḍi
      where thick madhavi creepers, surapunnai groves
      and shenbaga flowers bloom
      and the bees sing “tenna, tenna.”

1757. Kaliyan, the poet with a strong spear,
      the king of Thirumangai surrounded with mountain-like palaces,
      composed a garland of ten Tamil pāsurams
      on the god who went to Lanka with a large ocean-like army of monkeys,
      and, shooting arrows, burned Lanka
      and brought back his lovely-waisted wife Sita.
      If devotees learn and recite these ten pāsurams
      they will have no troubles in their lives.
