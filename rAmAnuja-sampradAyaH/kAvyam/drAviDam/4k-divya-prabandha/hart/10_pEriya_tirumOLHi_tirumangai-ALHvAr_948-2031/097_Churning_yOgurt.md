1908. Yashoda says,
      “Our cowherd clan is respected by all.
      If my son does something wrong,
      I can only upbraid him gently, saying,
      ‘You shouldn’t hurt other children.’
      I can’t scold him.
      His father Nandan won’t say anything either.
      O young friend, what can I do?
      It seems he goes to the corner house on this street
      to churn yogurt with a young girl.”

1909. A cowherdess says,
      “O dear Yashoda! I got up early
      and went to sell the churned buttermilk,
      looking for people to buy it,
      but I didn’t see anyone except the son of Nandan
      with hair that was decorated with fragrant flowers.
      Come and look, my beautiful friend
      from the last house on the street.
      I don’t see the butter and the ten pots of milk that I had,
      and I’m worried.
      What should I do? What should I do?”

1910. A cowherd woman says,
      “O lovely Yashoda,
      he is a little boy and he smiles sweetly.
      I keep a pot full of butter in the uri,
      but he has grabbed and swallowed it all,
      as much as a silver hill.
      He is a thief. Come and see him as he sleeps.
      All his hands are smeared with butter.
      His stomach is big enough to hold all the seven worlds,
      so it isn’t hard for him to keep all that butter in his stomach.
      I am ignorant! What can I do? What can I do?”

1911. A cowherd woman says,
      “Balaraman was born to a mother
      with spear-like eyes that were darkened with kohl.
      He and his brother Kaṇṇan were raised in the cowherd village together,
      but he doesn’t do naughty things like Kaṇṇan.
      Kaṇṇan tells lies, steals things
      and crawls and acts as if he knew nothing about it.
      Is he really a sweet child?
      We cowherd women cannot escape his tricks.
      What can I do? What can I do? ”

1912. A cowherd woman says,
      “One day before his father had returned,
      when I wasn’t at home and my friends weren’t around,
      he went near where my girl was playing,
      her fragrant hair decorated with beautiful flowers,
      and grabbed the ball she was playing with
      and took her clothes and did naughty things.
      What wrong have we done to Nandan’s son?
      O, friend, what can I do? What can I do?”

1913. A cowherdess says,
      “ O Yashoda, our lord who was carried to our cowherd village
      by his father Nandan at night when he was a child
      is the beloved of Lakshmi and of the earth goddess.
      He plays a bamboo flute and my daughter loves him.
      Her flower-like eyes are weary, her breasts are round,
      and her lotus-red mouth has grown pale.
      O beautiful friend, come and see how my daughter suffers.
      What can I do? What can I do?”

1914. A cowherd woman says,
      “The cowherds celebrated a festival
      and offered many kinds of food for the thousand-eyed Indra.
      O friend Yashoda, your son, disguised as a bhudam,
      went there today and grabbed all the food and ate it.
      See, it seems he is the Māyan
      who took all the food and swallowed it.”

1915. Yashoda says,
      “The cowherd women got together and called me.
      They said, ‘See, we kept the fermented yogurt,
      fragrant ghee and milk in various pots,
      but they are all empty now.’
      I felt ashamed and told my friends,
      ‘He is my dear lord!
      I can only plead with him not to do these naughty things,
      I can’t scold him.
      How could I scold my child
      who drank milk from the devil Putana and killed her?
      I am afraid of scolding him.’”

1916. Yashoda says,
      “Seven months after my dear son was born,
      when I had put my strong, matchless child
      to sleep on a bed soft as a flower
      and gone to bathe in the Yamuna river,
      he killed Sakaṭāsuran with his divine feet
      when he came as a cart that was large as a mountain.
      He rests on Adisesha on the ocean
      and Lakshmi stays on his faultless chest.
      I am afraid of scolding him after he did such a heroic deed.”

1917. Yashoda says,
      “O beautiful friends, I am afraid even of calling him by name.
      Even if the young children with soft, cotton-like feet
      eat a thousand measures of ghee,
      my friends, their mothers, do not scold them.
      You are the best among men!
      You killed Kamsan, the terrible Asuran
      on the day I was supposed to pay him money
      for the loan I took from him.
      I am not as strong as you, O Nambi.
      Do whatever you want.
      What can I do? What can I do?”

1918. Yashoda says to Kaṇṇan,
      “ O lovely one! How could you do these naughty things?
      O Nambi, you hid and went behind the beautiful cowherd girls
      when they bathed in the pond where lotuses bloom
      and stole their fine clothes and climbed up a tree.
      When the lovely-waisted girls begged you for their clothes,
      you said, ‘Come, beautiful ones, come and take them from me,’
      and you stayed in the tree.”

1919. Yashoda says,
      “This child has no fear,
      even to the extent of a tiny millet seed.
      I raised him with manliness and braveness.
      I kissed him and gave him lots of love. I have never scolded him,
      but now he never tells me anything he does.
      He climbed on the blooming green Kaḍamba tree,
      jumped into the pond and fought and killed Kālingan,
      the snake that has a thousand poisonous tongues.
      Now he has come back. How can I scold him?”

1920. Yashoda says,
      “O my lord, do great people do things that are not suitable?
      I gave birth to you. What can I do?
      You fought with Arishṭāsuran when he came as a bull
      from the fragrant forest where he lived
      bellowing like thunder and shaking all the seven worlds,
      as his eyes angry eyes looked like hot fire.
      It seems that you killed him and have come back home.”

1921. Kaliyan the chief of rich lovely Thirumangai
      surrounded with strong walls and the wide ocean
      composed fourteen sweet musical pāsurams on the lord
      who killed the angry elephant Kuvalayābeedam as large as a mountain.
      The poet describes how the cowherdess Yasodha,
      her walk as gentle as a swan’s, worries about him.
      If devotees learn and recite these pāsurams
      they will have no troubles in life.
