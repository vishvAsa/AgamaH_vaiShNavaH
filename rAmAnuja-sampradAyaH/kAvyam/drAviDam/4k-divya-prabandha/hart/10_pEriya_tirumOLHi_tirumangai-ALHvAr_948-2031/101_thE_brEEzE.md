1952. She says,
      “Our divine god protected the cows and cowherds
      from the storm by carrying Govardhana mountain.
      Heroic, he fought with the Rākshasas with his victorious bow
      and defeated them.
      Does the breeze blow on me as if it were fire
      because I think of his heroic deeds? What can I do?”

1953. She says,
      “The cold wind hurts me
      as the dark clouds pour down drops of rain.
      Am I being punished
      because I long to see the chest and the garlands
      of the dark god colored like a cloud or the ocean? What can I do?”

1954. She says,
      “With its rays the moon is angry with me
      and makes my pale body weak.
      My conch bangles become loose. What can I do?
      He has the color of the ocean that rises with white waves.
      What can I do?
      His thulasi garland with blooming flowers
      that drip honey calls to me.”

1955. She says,
      “He were taken to the clan
      of the cowherd village and raised there.
      When Putana came as a mother
      he drank milk from her breasts and killed her.
      Do the rays of the moon burn so hot
      because I think of his heroic deeds?”

1956. She says,
      “He took the form of a man-lion
      and split the chest of Hiraṇyan in two.
      Does the ocean cry in its loneliness
      because it wants to have the bright moon
      that the god makes wane to darkness?”

1957. She says,
      “He went to Lanka, bent his victorious bow
      and fought with the Rākshasas.
      On the palm tree, the andril bird
      in its nest made of lotuses coos and hurts me
      because I think of the heroic deeds of the lord.”

1958. She says,
      “Kāma comes carrying five flower arrows,
      shoots them at me without stopping
      and makes me suffer.
      Am I being punished
      because I saw the lord as dark as a kāyām flower
      when he came on Garuḍa
      and fell in love with him?”

1959. She says,
      “When the thought of the thulasi garland
      that adorns him entered my heart,
      it came along with the lovely, cool wind
      dripping with drops of rain.
      It will be very hard for my life to be saved.”

1960. She says,
      “If bees bring and spread the fragrance
      of the beautiful fresh thulasi garland
      that devotees use to decorate him,
      my eyes that are like kendai fish will close in sleep
      and the pale color of my body will change
      to the brightness it had before.”

1961. Kaliyan, the famous chief
      who carries a sword and is praised by all in Thirumangai

      who went as a messenger
      for the five Pandavas in the Bharatha war.
      If devotees learn and recite these pāsurams
      they will have no trouble in life.
