948. I was born with sorrow.
     I withered and suffered in life.
     When I was young my only wish
     was to love women and be with them.
     I searched for a way to escape
     from my desire for women and wandered everywhere.
     I searched for the feeling that would lead me
     to the highest state and found the name “Nārāyaṇa.”

949. I thought of the round breasts of women
     and melted to embrace them.
     I told women, “You are my life. You are my nectar.”
     How many days and how many ages
     have been wasted since I, a sinner,
     acted without realizing what I am doing.
     I worshiped the god of Kuḍandai
     surrounded with water
     where swans with white feathers embrace their mates.
     I praised him with my tongue,
     discovered the name “Nārāyaṇa.”
     and I am saved in this life itself.

950. I desired only a happy life and gained bad karma.
     I thought only of the beauty of women.
     I was like a dumb person
     and dreamed only of passion and wasted my days.
     If devotees approach him, the father of Kāma,
     he will go and stay in their minds.
     I found the name “Nārāyaṇa”
     and I am saved in this life itself.

951. I wanted to be successful in everything.
     I desired to have much wealth that would never be lost.
     I thought only of being with women with spear-like eyes.
     My heart is confused and my thoughts wanders everywhere.
     What can I do?
     You grew to the sky at the sacrifice of king Mahābali
     and you took the form of a boar, went to the underworld
     and brought back the earth goddess, stolen by an Asuran.
     Through your grace
     I have found the name “Nārāyaṇa” and am saved.

952. I have been a thief and done many wrong things.
     I wandered around as I wanted
     but now my mind has found the truth.
     When I discovered the right path that leads to him
     at once I received his divine grace.
     My heart melts and my voice grows weak.
     As tears fall all over my body
     all day until the middle of the dark night
     I call out the divine name, “Nārāyaṇa!”

953. My dear father is my kin, my king and my life,
     frightened the Rakshasas and killed them with his arrows.
     O devotees, worship the beautiful diamond-studded temple in Thanjai
     surrounded with strong walls and blooming with fragrant groves.
     O Nambis! I have found the name “Nārāyaṇa” and I am saved.

954. O learned ones!
     You praise the people in the world as you want, saying,
     “This one is from a reputable family.
     This one is famous. This one has good qualities.
     This one is as generous as a Karpaga tree.”
     Come and I will tell you something.
     Go and worship the lord of Kuḍandai, surrounded with water,
     and you will find the most excellent of things.
     Sing and praise the name, “Nārāyaṇa” and you will be saved.

955. I have not learned what is good for me.
     I have thought only of the desires that my five senses bring.
     Innocent, I have done no good deeds in my life.
     I wandered around doing only evil to all
     in this large world, but I have stopped that now.
     I want to find a good way to save my life.
     I, a slave of him, have found the name “Nārāyaṇa”
     and I hold to him as my refuge.

956. The name “Nārāyaṇa” will give a good family
     to his devotees and remove all their troubles.
     It will give them the highest place in heaven.
     It will his grace that leads them to moksha.
     It will give strength and all goodness.
     It will do all the things that a mother does for her children.
     I have found the name “Nārāyaṇa”
     and it will give me good life.

957. O devotees, when you are in trouble or at the end of your life,
     think of Thirumangai surrounded by ponds
     with abundant water where groves swarm with bees
     and clouds float above the tall trees
     and worship him with a garland of divine pāsurams composed by Kaliyan.
     Say the name “Nārāyaṇa” and he will remove the results of your karma.
