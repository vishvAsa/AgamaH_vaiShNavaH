1398. In Thennarangam surrounded by the beautiful ocean
      I saw the lord who is as strong as an elephant,
      a dark emerald that lies on Adisesha on the ocean.
      He, Thirumaal, my lord who is sweet to me always,
      taught the Vedas to the sages
      and protected the cows and the cowherds from the storm.

1399. In Thennarangam I saw Thirumal,
      the lord of Thirukkuṛunguḍi, Thiruthaṇgā
      and the good lord of Thirukkarampanur
      who was still hungry
      even after he swallowed the dark seven oceans,
      seven mountains and seven worlds.

1400. In Thennarangam I saw the lord,
      a cowherd who took the form of a boar and split open the earth
      to bring the earth goddess from the underworld,
      who measured the earth and sky with his two feet
      and stays always like sweet honey and nectar
      in the hearts of his devotees.

1401. In Thennaragam surrounded by the beautiful ocean I saw the lord
      who rests on Adisesha on the large ocean,
      kicked the Asuran when he came as a cart and killed him,
      split open the chest of the Rākshasa Hiraṇyan,
      and measured the world with his two feet.

1402. The lord who is the ocean, fire and the big earth,
      burned Lanka, the kingdom of the Rākshasas, and swallowed the sacrificial food
      that the Vediyars made for Indra, the king of the gods.
      I have not seen him in other places where his devotees saw him,
      I saw him only in Thennarangam.

1403. In Thennarangam I saw the lord
      who is the Karpaga tree that gives whatever one wants,
      and the path of tapas for those who have controlled their anger.
      He swallowed the earth and spit it out, he killed Kamsan,
      and went to the battle field riding on his winged garuḍa,
      to fight with angry Shiva and his son Karthikeya
      and his escort to help Vānāsuran in the battle,
      and made them all retreat from the battlefield. ??

1403. He killed Kamsan and he swallowed the earth and spit it out.
      When angry Shiva came with his son Karthikeya
      and his escort to help Vānāsuran in the battle
      the lord riding on his lovely-winged eagle
      fought with them and made them all retreat from the battlefield.
      He is the Karpaga tree that gives whatever anyone wants,
      and the path of tapas for those who have controlled their anger.
      I saw him in Thennarangam.

1404. Devotees think only of Thirumal who is the path of tapas always
      and he has come to me and abides in my mind.
      The lord who measured the world and the sky with his two feet
      stays in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills
      and in Thirukkovalur surrounded by groves
      blooming with bunches of flowers.
      He is faultless and I saw him in Thennarangam.

1405. I saw the highest lord in Thennarangam
      who does not give his grace
      to Buddhists with their orange clothes or to dirty Jains
      and only gives his grace to the devotees who approach him,
      my relatives, me, my father, my mother
      and the gods in the sky.

1406. I saw the dark cloud-colored lord of Thennarangam,
      a shining emerald, who has removed my false thoughts
      and makes me control my mind.
      If people think of his true form,
      the clever lord is truth for them.

1407. Kaliyan the famous poet composed ten musical Tamil pāsurams
      praising the god of beautiful Thennarangam who lovingly grazed cows.
      If devotees learn and recite these ten famous pāsurams well
      the results of their bad karma will not come to them.
