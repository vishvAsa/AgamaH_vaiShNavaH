1098. I will not spend even the time it takes to blink
      thinking of those who do not think of my god
      who took the form of Mohini
      and gave to the gods the nectar that came from the milky ocean,
      cheating the sword-carrying Asurans, the enemies of the gods.
      He stays in beautiful cool Kaḍalmallai Thalasayanam
      surrounded by the large ocean.

1099. Those devotees who think in their hearts
      and worship the cloud-colored lord of Kaḍalmallaithalasayanam
      who keeps beautiful Lakshmi
      on his chest seated on a fresh lotus dripping with dew
      and at his side the earth goddess
      are my chiefs and my rulers.

1100. My chiefs and my rulers are the devotees
      who in their hearts worship the cloud-colored lord,
      the light of knowledge who took the form of a boar
      and brought the earth goddess from the underworld, embracing her.
      The gods in the sky happily come,
      circle his temple and worship him
      in Kaḍalmallai Thalasayanam surrounded by forests.

1101. The devotees are our family gods
      who worship in their hearts
      the god of Kaḍalmallai Thalasayanam
      who heroically fought a cruel war,
      defeated his enemies and left their bodies for animals to eat
      as the warriors’ bodies that had been loved by their wives were burned.

1102. O my good heart!
      Praise and love the devotees
      who do not worship god of the Jains
      who carry an umbrella and a small peacock feather.
      Only love and worship our lord of Kachi
      in Kaḍalmallai Thalasayanam.

1103. O ignorant heart,
      embrace and worship the devotees
      who circle the temple and worship the god
      of Kaḍalmallai Thalasayanam
      where ships bring golden treasure,
      piles of the nine precious jewels,
      and herds of large elephants
      and unload them on the sea shore.

1104. O my pure heart!
      Worship the devotees who keep in their hearts
      the lord of Kaḍalmallai Thalasayanam
      who was born on the earth as a small baby
      and who drank the poisonous milk of scheming Putanā
      when she came as a mother,
      and fought and conquered his enemy Kamsan.

1105. O my pure heart!
      Worship the devotees
      who worship the god in their hearts
      of Kaḍalmallai Thalasayanam
      where beautiful lotuses in the flourishing water
      crushed by the farmers plowing with bulls
      and kazhuneer blossoms that escaped the plows
      both spread their fragrance on the shore.

1106. O my ignorant heart!
      Worship the devotees of him
      who carries a divine discus in his hands
      and keeps Shiva, dancer on the burning ground on his left side.
      He rests on Adisesha on the ocean in Kaḍalmallai Thalasayanam
      where the gods in the sky come and worship him happily.

1107. Kaliyan, the warrior with a long spear,
      the devotee of the devotees who always think of him,
      composed ten pāsurams on the devotees of the god
      of Kaḍalmallai Thalasayanam
      that has long streets where flowers spread their fragrance.
      If devotees worship his devotees
      and learn and recite the pāsurams of Thirumangai
      they will become kings of kings.
