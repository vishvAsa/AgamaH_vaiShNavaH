1738. You are the beloved of the beautiful Lakshmi
      on a lovely lotus swarming with bees.
      I worshiped and worshiped you happily
      and became your devotee.
      What can you do for me? Tell me.
      You who created the four Vedas,
      O lord of Thirukkaṇṇapuram.

1739. You contain within yourself the wide oceans,
      the sky, the mountains and all the seven worlds.
      I will not even think there are other gods
      except you to keep in my heart,
      O lord, god of Thirukkaṇṇapuram.

1740. I will not make friends with those
      who think there are other gods.
      I am a slave only of your devotees.
      Whatever I say, it is only the eight sounds
      of your divine name that I have learned,
      O lord, dear god of Thirukkaṇṇapuram.

1741. You drank the fire-like poisonous milk
      from the devil Putanā’s young breasts and killed her.
      You, the beloved of Lakshmi
      with long, sharp sword-like eyes
      who stays on a lotus that drips honey,
      are auspicious and I worship you happily.

1742. I do not want any connection with parents and relatives.
      I have no affection for any other but have come to you.
      You should think of me as your friend in your heart
      and give me your grace,
      O lord, dear lord of Kaṇṇapuram
      where learned people live.

1743. I found and stayed with your devotees
      who praise your divine feet and think of you alone.
      I worship you.
      I am afraid that the messengers of Yama will come and take me.
      Protect me and keep them from coming to me
      and putting their hands on me.
      O father, god of Kaṇṇapuram.

1744. You rest on the snake Adisesha,
      your bed floating on the flood of white water with roaring waves.
      O generous lord, we are your devotees.
      You stay like a thief in Kaṇṇapuram and you protect us.

1745. I think constantly of your heroic deeds,
      how you took the form of a dwarf
      and measured the world at Mahabali’s sacrifice,
      and how as a man-lion you split open
      the ornamented chest of Hiranyan,
      the Asuran armed with a shining sword.
      I have collected much bad karma
      and have not lived a good life,
      and now I find only troubles.
      Save me, O dear god of Kaṇṇapuram.

1746. You have made me your devotee
      and all my bad karma has left me.
      You showed me how I can praise you
      with songs and keep you in my heart,
      O dear god of Kaṇṇapuram.

1747. Kaliyan, the famous poet,
      the devotee of the dear lord, composed ten pāsurams
      on the god of Thirukaṇṇapuram praised by all.
      If devotees learn and sing these pāsurams with love
      they will go to heaven and rule there.
      We know that surely.
