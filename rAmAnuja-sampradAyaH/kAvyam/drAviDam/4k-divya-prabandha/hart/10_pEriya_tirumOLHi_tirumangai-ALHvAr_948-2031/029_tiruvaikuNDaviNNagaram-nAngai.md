1228. The dark lord colored like a rain-giving cloud,
      strong as a bull, who split open the wide chest of the evil Asuran Hiraṇyan,
      and who churned the milky ocean and gave the nectar to the gods
      stays happily every day
      in the temple of Vaikuṇḍaviṇṇagaram in Nāngur
      where jasmine bushes, punnai trees,
      beautiful cherundi trees and shenbaga flowers bloom in the rain,
      spreading their fragrance in the lovely groves,
      and fish frolic, swim and play in the ponds.
      O innocent heart, let us go there and worship him.

1229. The lord who took the form of a strong lion
      and split open the chest of Hiṛanyan with his claws,
      terrifying the gods and the Asurans as they looked on
      and all the directions trembled,
      stays happily every day in Vaikuṇḍaviṇṇagaram,
      the temple in Nāngur where good-natured Vediyars,
      reciters of the divine Vedas
      and the seven kinds of music live performing abundant sacrifices.
      O innocent heart, let us go there and worship him.

1230. Our ancient lord swallowed the world of the divine gods,
      the oceans with rolling waves and all the worlds
      and kept them all in his stomach.
      When Shiva was wandering as a beggar,
      he poured his blood into the skull of Nānmuhan
      that was stuck to Shiva’s hand and made it fall,
      removing the curse of Shiva.
      He stays happily in the temple Vaikuṇḍviṇṇagaram in Nāngur
      where good paddy plants, young palm trees,
      banana trees, betel plants and long-branched kamugu trees all grow and flourish.
      O innocent heart, let us go there and worship him.

1231. As Rama, our lord with his strong arms cut off the nose
      and ears of Surpanaha, the vine-like daughter of the Rākshasa family
      with a waist ornamented with precious jewels,
      and made her scream, holding her beautiful hands to her head
      as she ran to Lanka and cried to her brother.
      He stays happily in Vaikuṇḍaviṇṇagaram, the temple in Nāngur
      where tridents studded with jewels rise over the beautiful patios
      splitting the bottoms of the clouds and precious pearls spill from them
      and fall on the large beautiful palaces that look like shining hills.
      O innocent heart, let us go there and worship him.

1232. Our lord with wide arms
      who went to Lanka with his matchless bow,
      smashed it to pieces and fought with Rāvaṇa, its king,
      making his ten heads and twenty arms fall to the earth
      and brought back his wife, the gentle Sita
      with a waist as thin as lightning
      stays happily in Vaikuṇḍaviṇṇagaram,
      the temple in Nāngur where good paddy, red lotuses,
      vāḷai fish and beautiful kazhuneer flowers
      flourish all together in the fields
      and where many Vediyars live,
      reciters of the Vedas with everlasting fame.
      O innocent heart, let us go there and worship him.

1233. The god of the gods
      who drank the milk from the breasts of the devil Putanā,
      when she came as a beautiful woman,
      destroyed the two Asurans when they came as Marudu trees
      and killed Sakaṭasuran when he came as a cart,
      stays happily in Vaikuṇḍaviṇṇagaram, the temple in Nāngur
      where many generous Vediyars live, reciters of the Vedas
      and skilled in all the arts.
      O innocent heart, let us go there and worship him.

1234. The lord, strong as a bull, swallowed the worlds, the ocean and the hills,
      threw Vathsāsuran and Kapithāsuran on each other
      when they came in the forms of a calf and a vilam tree,
      and stole the butter that the cowherd women with sharp spear-like eyes
      had churned and kept.
      He stays happily every day in Vaikuṇḍaviṇṇagaram, the temple in Nāngur
      where good kamugu trees, coconut trees, fine paddy and sugarcane
      flourish by the water that flows from the channels
      and increases the wealth there.
      O innocent heart, let us go there and worship him.

1235. The lord, the origin of the gods
      who keeps Shiva and Nānmuhan on his divine body
      killed the angry Narahāsuran with the discus he holds in his hands.
      He stays happily in the temple in Vaikuṇḍaviṇṇagaram
      in beautiful and flourishing Nāngur where lotuses bloom and never wither
      and beautiful kazuneer flowers are spread everywhere, dripping with honey,
      and where water flows through the channels
      that the farmers block with small dams and the fields will flourish.
      O innocent heart, let us go there and worship him.

1236. The lord who rests on Adisesha as the gods in the sky
      and pious sages
      come and sprinkle beautiful flowers on his feet say,
      “You are matchless. Give us your grace!”
      stays happily in the temple of Vaikunḍaviṇṇagaram in Nāngur
      surrounded with flourishing fields
      where lovely kayal, vālai and red fish frolic amid the good paddy fields
      and the streets are filled with tall jewel-studded palaces
      that touch the moon surrounded with dark clouds.
      O innocent heart, let us go there and worship him.

1237. Kaliyan, who kills his foes with his sword as if he were Yama,
      the chief of Thirumangai surrounded with groves swarming with bees,
      composed ten Tamil pāsurams as beautiful as Sangam poems
      on the lotus-eyed Neḍumāl who with a conch, club and discus
      stays happily in the temple of Vaikuṇḍaviṇṇagaram in Nāngur
      surrounded by the ocean where boats float.
      If devotees learn and recite these songs
      they will rule this world and the sky.
