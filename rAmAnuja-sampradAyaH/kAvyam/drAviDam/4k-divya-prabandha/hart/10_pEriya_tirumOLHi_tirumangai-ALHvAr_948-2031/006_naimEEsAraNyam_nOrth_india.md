998. Before in my life, I wanted only to enjoy
     the small foreheads, round arms, beautiful breasts
     and shining moon-like smiles of lovely women.
     I understand now that I was weak and what I did was wrong.
     I am ashamed that I wanted to be with young women.
     I know this birth is a sickness
     and I do not want to be born again.
     O my father! You stay in Naimeesāraṇyam.
     I have approached your divine feet
     and you are my refuge.

999. I have always enjoyed women
     with long dark eyes, beautiful figures
     and feet ornamented with anklets.
     I forgot dharma, enjoyed the bliss that my five senses gave
     and wasted my life.
     Your generous hands give whatever your devotees ask of you.
     You are a cowherd. You are a Māyan.
     You are the king of the gods in the sky,
     and they worship you and ask your grace.
     O my father! You stay in Naimeesāraṇyam.
     I have approached your divine feet
     and you are my refuge.

1000. I gambled and stole things from others.
      I loved beautiful curly-headed women.
      I wandered all over wherever I wished and wasted my life.
      Now I have become your devotee and shiver when I think
      of the troubles that Yama’s messengers will bring.
      O lord who churned the milky ocean roaring with white waves,
      my father, you stay in Naimeesāraṇyam.
      I have approached your divine feet, my refuge.

1001. Someone may leave his wife
      with fragrant hair swarming with bees
      and love someone else’s wife and wealth
      and believe in that kind of life.
      When he dies and goes to Yama’s world,
      Yama’s messengers will tell him,
      “Embrace this burning copper doll, you sinner!”
      I am afraid of the thought that I will be like that.
      You are my friend.
      O my father! You stay in Naimeesāraṇyam.
      I have approached your divine feet
      and you are my refuge.

1002. When people suffering in poverty came to me
      and asked me, “Please give me a little bit of food,”
      I was unkind and told them cruelly,
      “No. I have no food!” and refused them.
      What a pity that was.
      I have not thought of the results of my bad deeds.
      I am afraid that when Yama’s messengers come for me,
      they will say cruel things and make me suffer.
      I shiver and have come to your divine feet.
      O father, you stay in Naimeesāraṇyam
      and you are my refuge.

1003. With a crooked mind I did evil things.
      I wandered around, associated with people like dogs,
      became weak, ran about and destroyed many lives.
      I didn’t feel bad at all.
      I didn’t think of what will happen to me in the world of Yama.
      O highest lord resting on the milky ocean,
      I searched for you and came to your divine feet.
      You are my refuge. You are my father
      and you stay in Naimeesāraṇyam.

1004. In my mind I thought only of unjust deeds
      and did them without any fear, speaking bad words.
      When I listened to the timeless advice of the elders, and sages, I trembled.
      I am a cheater, yet I am your slave.
      You, the god of the sky who are poison to the Rāksasas
      never leave the minds of your devotees.
      O my father, god of Naimeesāraṇyam,
      I have come to your divine feet and you are my refuge.

1005. Kali, the god of time,
      told the five senses to come to me
      and make me surrender to the pleasures they offered .
      Now I have been destroyed by the trouble that they cause me.
      You have the dark color of the wide ocean
      and stay in Thirukkuṛungudi.
      I have worshiped you with sweet words and flowers
      and praised you with my tongue.
      O my father, you stay in Naimeesāraṇyam,
      I have come to your divine feet and you are my refuge.

1006. This body is made of bones,
      covered with flesh, skin and hair that are like walls.
      It has nine openings and it is like a little hut.
      When I depart from this body,
      I will think only of you as my refuge.
      You are the beloved of the goddess Malarmagaḷ
      seated on a lotus dripping with honey
      and you rest with her on the wide ocean rolling with waves.
      I have done difficult tapas to reach you.
      O my father, you stay in Naimeesāraṇyam,
      I have come to your divine feet and you are my refuge.

1007. Kaliyan loved, worshiped and composed these pāsurams
      praising the god of Naimeesāraṇyam
      where Indra the king of the gods
      came with the other gods, worshiped our father
      and asked him to remove their troubles.
      If devotees learn and recite these ten poems
      they will rule the world surrounded by sounding oceans
      under a white umbrella and become gods.
