1348. The lord who is a dancer, my ruler

1355. Our father who drove the chariot for Arjuna
      in the Bharatha war and destroyed the heroic Kauravas
      whose long spears were always smeared with blood,

      with his blood and made it fall

      perform sacrifices with three fires and recite the Vedas.

1356. Our faultless lord who took the form of a fish,
      saved the Vedas from the flood
      and then, as a swan, taught them to the sages
      when the earth and sky were covered with deep darkness
      stays happily in beautiful Puḷḷambudanguḍi
      where the Ponni river with its waves
      brings nine types of sparkling jewels,
      pearls from bamboos, chowries and gold
      and leaves them all on its banks.

1357. Kaliyan, the chief of Thirumangai,
      as generous as a dark cloud and praised by the learned ones,
      composed these ten pāsurams on the god,
      the cowherd, the beloved of Lakshmi seated on a golden lotus
      who danced on the trembling heads of Kālingan.
      If devotees learn and recite these ten Tamil pāsurams,
      they will have no trouble in their lives.
