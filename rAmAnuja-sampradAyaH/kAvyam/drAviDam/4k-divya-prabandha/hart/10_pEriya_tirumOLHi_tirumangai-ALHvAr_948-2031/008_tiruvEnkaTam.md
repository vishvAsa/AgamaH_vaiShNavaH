   All the Divyadesams from this Pāsuram are in South India

1018. Our ancient, lotus-eyed god
      who rests on the wide conch-filled ocean,
      who broke the Kurundam trees
      blooming with flowers and dripping with honey
      and who as a cowherd split open the beak of the Asuran
      that came as a bird
      stays in Thiruvenkaṭam
      where beautiful fish frolic in the springs filled with abundant water.
      O heart, let us go there and worship him.

1019. Our lord who rests on the milky ocean in Srirangam,
      who drank the poisonous milk
      from the breasts of the devil Putanā,
      stays in Thiruvenkaṭam
      where his good devotees go and praise him every day saying,
      “He is white in the first eon.
      He is dark in the second eon.
      He is sapphire-colored in the third eon,”
      and worship him on that hill.
      O heart, let us go there and worship him.

1020. Our faultless lord with a discus
      went between the marudam trees and broke them
      as the gods in the sky folded their hands
      and worshiped his lotus feet
      and carried Govardhana mountain as an umbrella,
      to stop the rain when Indra made a storm
      to afflict the cows and the cowherds.
      He stays in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills.
      O heart, let us go there and worship him.

1021. The lord of Thiruviḍavendai,
      the highest light, who drove the chariot for Arjuna,
      fighting in the Bharatha war and conquering the Kauravas,
      and who danced the Kuravai dance with the cowherds
      holding hands with them
      stays in Thiruvenkaṭam
      surrounded with sacred water and thick groves
      and in the hearts of his devotees.
      O heart, let us go there and worship him.

1022. The eight-armed god of the Himalayas
      took the form of a bachelor,
      went to the sacrifice of generous Mahabali,
      the king of the Asurans, begged for three feet of land
      and measured the earth and the sky with two steps.
      He shot one arrow and destroyed seven marā trees,
      and he saved the long-trunked elephant Gajendra from the crocodile.
      He stays in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills.
      O heart, let us go there and worship him.

1023. The lord who swallowed all the eight directions
      and the seven worlds at the end of the eon,
      kept them in his golden stomach and rested on a banyan leaf,
      removed the curse of the milky white moon,
      took the form of a strong man-lion with shining teeth
      and split open the chest of the heroic Asuran Hiraṇyan
      stays in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills.
      O heart, let us go there and worship him.

1024. The thousand-named god who has no birth
      and is the earth, water, fire, wind and sky
      stays in the beautiful Thiruvenkaṭam hills
      surrounded with groves where the rain pours
      and cold drops fall from the dark clouds floating in the sky.
      O heart, let us go there and worship him.

1025. The king of the gods
      who is sky, fire, wind, earth and water
      and the beloved of beautiful Lakshmi
      seated on a fragrant lotus swarming with bees
      stays in Thiruvenkaṭam
      where lovely gypsy women with vine-like waists
      stand on high platforms to guard flourishing millet fields.
      O heart, let us go there and worship him.

1026. Our highest lord who will remove their future births
      for his devotees if they recite his divine name
      with the mantra of eight syllables again and again
      stays in Thiruvenkaṭam,
      the hill that gives prosperity to all the worlds
      and is surrounded with lovely fragrant flowers.
      O heart, let us go there and worship him.

1027. Kaliyan, the chief of Thirumangai,
      composed a divine garland of ten Tamil pāsurams
      with fine words on the precious god of Thiruvenkaṭam
      where pretty kayal fish swim happily in mountain springs.
      If devotees learn and recite these pāsurams faithfully
      they will rule the world surrounded with large oceans
      where the waves roll
      and then go to heaven and rule there.
