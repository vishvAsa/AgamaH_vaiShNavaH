1648. My daughter’s breasts have become pale.
      She is in love with the ocean-colored god and she says,
      “A bow, a shining golden discus,
      a strong sword called Nandaham and a white conch!”
      She says, “Look, unlike his enemies,
      he has four arms strong as mountains.”
      Did she see the god of Kaṇṇapuram
      where good Vediyars live reciting the beautiful Vedas?

1649. My daughter says, “Carrying a bow in his hands,
      he fought with his enemies and conquered them.”
      She says, “In one hand he carries the golden discus
      that destroyed his enemies when they came fight him.”
      She says, “There is no one equal to you,
      and you are my dear god.”
      Did she see the dear dark mountain-like god of Kaṇṇapuram?

1650. My daughter says,
      “He wears a thulasi garland on his crown
      studded with precious diamonds.”
      She says, “He wears beautiful shining emerald earrings on his ears,
      and a golden chain studded with precious diamonds shines on his chest.”
      The dear god stays in Kaṇṇapuram
      surrounded with mighty walls.
      Did she see him there?”

1651. My daughter says,
      “On his chest he wears a cool thulasi garland where bees swarm.
      My dear god who rides on an eagle
      broke the tusks of the elephant Kuvalayābeeḍam.
      See, he has a beautiful mouth red as coral.”
      Did she see the god of Kaṇṇapuram
      where dark clouds in the sky roar?

1652. My daughter says,
      “He has beautiful lotus hands and feet.”
      She says, “The beauty of his precious crown
      and his golden ornaments doesn’t go away from my mind.”
      She says, “He has the long lovely-eyed Lakshmi on his mountain-like chest.”

      where fragrant lotus flowers bloom dripping honey?

1653. My daughter says,
      “He has a thousand names.
      He is generous, he is generous!”
      She says, “His ears are decorated
      with beautiful emerald earrings
      and he has eight arms.”
      She says, “He has the color of a dark cloud that pours rain.
      He is like a tall mountain.”
      Did she see the dear god of Kaṇṇapuram
      surrounded with flourishing fields?

1654. My daughter says,
      “He is wearing a red garment tied with a belt.”
      She says, “His two fair beautiful feet
      and lovely hands are like lotuses.”
      She says, “He has a dark sapphire-colored body.
      Is it emerald or is it a dark cloud?”
      Did she see the dear god of Kaṇṇapuram,
      where Vediyars live lighting sacrificial fires?

1655. My daughter says,
      “He comes riding on a victorious eagle
      in the middle of a mandram in the village.”
      She says, “For Indra himself who conquers all in battles, he is Indra.”
      She says, “Couldn’t we born as women
      have the fortune of embracing his chest?”
      Did she see the dear god of Kaṇṇapuram
      where Vediyars, scholars of the Vedas, live?

1656. My daughter says,
      “His shining crown is adorned with fragrant garlands swarming with bees.”
      She says, “ I love him so much
      that I will not be separated from him even a moment.”
      She says, “Where did I see him before?”
      repeating the same question again and again.
      Did she see the dear god of Kaṇṇapuram
      that attracts everyone’s mind?

1657. Kaliyan the poet composed a beautiful garland
      of ten Tamil pāsurams on the god of Thirukkaṇṇapuram
      surrounded by a fragrant forest with good trees
      describing how a mother is worried
      that her daughter with soft doe-like eyes has fallen in love with the god
      and wonders whether she has seen him.
      If devotees learn and recite these pāsurams
      they will go to the golden world
      where the Karpaga tree blooms and stay there as famous kings.
