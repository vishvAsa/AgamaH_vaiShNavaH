1868. “We praise the divine name of Rama.
      O Nampi, we bow to you, O Sugriva, we worship you.
      Protect us, tell your monkey army not to hurt us.
      We dance like dancers of the kuthu dance.
      Kuzhamaṇi thuurame!”

1869. “Indrajit did not praise the name of the god.
      He said, ‘Our dear king, take care me.’
      He could not fight with Rama and was killed by Rama’s arrows.
      O Nambi Hanuman! Sugriva! Angada! Naḷa!
      Kumbhakarna lost and was killed in the war.
      Kuzhamaṇi thuurame!”

1870. “O Rama! You came to the earth
      as a Yama for our king Ravaṇa, the ruler of Lanka.
      May the dark cloud-like Neelan live long!
      May Susheṇan live long.
      May Angadan live long.
      We praise all of you and dance beautifully.
      Kuzhamaṇi thuurame!”

1871. “Evil-minded Ravaṇa desired fragrant-haired Sita
      and Rama killed him.
      We praise the younger brother of Rama, Lakshmaṇa,
      valorous in victory, who killed the Rākshasas
      by bending his bow and leaving them for the ghouls
      on the battlefield to eat.
      Kuzhamaṇi thuurame!”

1872. “We lost the war and do not need any honor.
      Give us your grace today and our lives.
      You are our lords and relatives.
      Look at us. Do not kill us.
      We are big as mountains, and we dance for you.
      Kuzhamaṇi thuurame!”

1873. “Your king constructed a bridge of stones across the ocean,
      went past all our guards and came to Lanka, afflicting us.
      We could not fight and conquer him. We are afraid of him.
      You are the son of hot sun.
      Do not kill us. We dance for you and ask your grace.
      Kuzhamaṇi thuurame!”

1874. “O Rākshasas, come,
      give up your thoughts of fighting with the monkeys.
      If you want Rama and the others not to be angry with you
      do not speak heroic words.
      Heroic Hanuman has an ancient birth—let us praise him.
      Let us dance so that the monkey heroes
      who are as strong as Yama’s messengers can see us.
      Kuzhamaṇi thuurame!”

1875. “The monkey army of Rama,
      after wearing us down and conquering us,
      should not kill our elephants that eat so well
      or our galloping horses.
      They should not destroy our chariots or the Rākshasas.
      Let the dark kuvalai-colored Rama, the king of Ayodhya
      surrounded with tall coral-studded palaces see us.
      Let us dance. Kuzhamaṇi thuurame!”

1876. “Our king Ravaṇa carried a long spear
      with a leaf-shaped blade and ran from the battlefield.
      We wanted to survive and have come to you.
      We will not fight with your king or with all of you.
      Together as a group we dance. Kuzhamaṇi thuurame!”

1877. Kaliyan with a spear smeared with oil
      composed a garland of ten musical pāsurams
      in which the mountain-like Rakshasas
      exclaimed, “kuzhamaṇi thuuram”
      after fighting a cruel war in famed ancient Lanka
      with Rama and the monkeys.
      Sing these ten pāsurams and dance.
