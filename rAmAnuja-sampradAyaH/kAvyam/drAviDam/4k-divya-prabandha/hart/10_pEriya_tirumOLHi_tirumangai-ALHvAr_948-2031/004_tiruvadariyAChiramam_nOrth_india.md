978. The lord who took the form of a boar, split open the earth

     killed the strong Rakshasas
     and pierced the chest of strong Vāli in the forest

     and took Lanka and the oceans

     that was brought down from heaven by the tapas of the divine sage Bagirathan.

986. The shining god of the sky and of the eon
     who swallowed the clouds, the wind, the mountains,

     stays in Thiruvadariyāchiramam on the banks of the Ganges
     that falls to the earth from the sky with abundant water
     splitting open the ground and making the earth goddess tremble.

987. The poet Kaliyan composed ten pāsurams
     on the dark ocean-colored lord
     of Thiruvadariyāchiramam on the banks of the Ganges
     that flows with shining water and rolling waves.
     If devotees learn and recite these ten pāsurams
     they will rule this world surrounded by the wide oceans
     under a royal umbrella and become gods in the sky.
