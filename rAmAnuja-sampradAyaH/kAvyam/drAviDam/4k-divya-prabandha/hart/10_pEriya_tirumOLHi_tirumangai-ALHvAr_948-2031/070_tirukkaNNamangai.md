    (Bhakthavatsala Perumal & Abhisekhavalli)

1638. I searched for him and in Thirukaṇṇamangai
      I found the lord who is the large ocean, a heroic bull,
      female and male, the results of tapas
      who gives endless grace to the sages,
      a precious chain of pearls, the soul of his devotees,
      the desire in my mind,
      a lovely bud, a fragrant blossom
      and as sweet as a fruit and sugarcane.

1639. Thirumāl who is truth and falsehood
      and the result of true tapas gives moksha to all.
      He, the dark ocean-colored one with a conch in his hand
      is the Māyan who lay on a banian leaf.
      He is yesterday, the afternoon of today and tomorrow
      and the months and years.
      I found him, sweet as jaggery, as sugarcane, and as its juice
      in Thirumangai.

1640. Our Esan with a wonderful nature gives us his grace
      and happily keeps on his body Shiva
      with the beautiful fragrant-haired Girija, the daughter of Himavan.
      He shines on the peak of the northern mountain
      where the cool moon floats in the sky.
      I searched for him who is night and day
      and found him in Thirukaṇṇamangai.
      We all love and worship him.

1641. He, the young Māyan
      who drank poisonous milk from the breasts of the devil Putanā
      and is worshipped by sages with minds devoid of confusion,
      stays in Thirukkovalur surrounded by walls and backwaters.
      He, my father, the shining light
      whom the Vediyars keep in their minds,
      is my refuge when I grow weak
      and my jewel and treasure when I am poor.
      I searched for him and found him in Thirukaṇṇamangai.

1642. I searched for him who is wind and water
      and found him in Thirukaṇṇamangai,
      the omnipresent lord of the Himalayas,
      strong as a bull, our strength and the cure for our future,
      and the giver of moksha for his devotees.
      The lord with a discus in his hand
      who is Yama for his enemies stays in Thirunindravur,
      shining like a large beautiful jewel mountain
      and a string of precious pearls.

1643. The lord who carries a discus in his hand,
      is a bright precious coral, a pot where jewels are stored,
      the beloved of beautiful Lakshmi
      all the seven worlds and the end of the eon.
      He taught the Vedas to the sages
      and fought and destroyed the Asuran that came as a horse.
      I found him in Thirukaṇṇamangai
      surrounded with fields where kazhuneer flowers bloom.

1644. The divine god of the gods,
      the best among the three gods,
      is a shining light, fire, water the sky and the earth.
      He killed the Asuran who came as a horse
      and when he took the form of Mohini,
      Shiva fell in love with him.
      I found him, the father of Nānmuhan,
      who is in the thoughts in the minds of all
      in Thirumangai surrounded with groves swarming with bees
      that sing as they drink honey.

1645. He is like an angry elephant
      threw the Asuran that came as a calf
      at the vilam fruit that was an Asuran
      and killed them both,
      drank the milk from the breasts of the devil Putanā,
      killed the Rākshasa Rāvaṇa, the king of Lanka
      who carried a strong sword,
      and cheated Kamsan and killed him.
      He is our nectar, our Nambi
      who protects his loving devotees,
      and I found him in Thirukaṇṇamangai.

1646. Thirumāl is music and its sweetness,
      the butter in milk, the sky, shining light,
      the brightness of a lamp and sacrifice.
      He, the dark one, is the earth, the mountains
      and the waves on the ocean,
      the beautiful moon that rises in the evening,
      and the eyes of the Vediyars.
      I found him in Thirukaṇṇamangai
      and my eyes enjoyed him.

1647. Kaliyan composed ten beautiful Tamil pāsurams
      describing how he found the god of Thirukaṇṇamangai.
      If devotees recite these pāsurams
      they will reach heaven in the sky where the moon floats,
      become gods and find joy.
      O Kaṇṇan with a white conch in your hand,
      if I may say what I really think,
      if you wished, even you might learn
      these pāsurams of Kaliyan and understand them.
