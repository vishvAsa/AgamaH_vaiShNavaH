1048. O heart, our father, worshiped by the sages in their hearts,
      who took the form of a bachelor dwarf,
      went to Mahabali’s sacrifice and measured the world and the sky,
      stays in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills where hunters make fire
      with wood from akil trees and the smoke rises to the top of the hills.
      Become his slave now.

1049. O heart, the god of dharma who has no relatives or family
      and who destroys the future births of his devotees on this earth
      stays in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills
      where gypsy girls and bees sing kurinji songs together.
      Become his slave now.

1050. O heart, the lord, the ruler of the earth and the sky
      who will give moksha to his devotees
      if they take flower garlands and other things
      and go to his temples and worship him
      stays in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills in the north where bees swarm.
      Become his slave now.

1051. O heart, what are you doing without worshiping him,
      our father, the soul of the gods
      and the beloved of the cowherd women,
      who protects the devotees who praise him,
      takes them to heaven from the earth
      and gives them moksha.
      He stays and rules the high Thiruvenkaṭam hills where clouds float.
      Become his slave now.

1052. O heart, the Buddhists fast and worship their god
      who stays under a bodhi tree
      and the Jains remain in their Paḷḷi and worship their god
      who stays under a flourishing peepul tree,
      each performing their own kind of worship.
      Our god who is praised everywhere
      by the gods in the sky and the Asurans
      stays in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills and gives his grace to all.
      Become the slave of the beautiful lord now.

1053. O heart, the Jains wear orange clothes and are bald,
      and with their people they eat together until they become fat.
      Our god of gods, as precious as eyes
      stays in the temple in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills
      where herds of deer live.
      Become his slave now.

1054. O heart, the Jains are proud and argue about different religions,
      wanting to prove theirs is the best
      and they eat large quantities of yogurt rice and become fat.
      Our lord shines like the sun
      and stays in the temple in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills where bees buzz.
      Praise him and become his slave now.

1055. O heart, you have heard that people say,
      “He is far. He is near. He is short. He is tall.”
      I do not think like that.
      He stays in the temple in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills
      where bamboo canes split open and throw out white pearls.
      Become the slave of the lord of the cowherds now.

1056. O heart, you say the same things
      that others get together and say about him.
      Listen to this carefully.
      Many people sing, dance, praise and worship him
      but they cannot see him.
      The dancing lord stays in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills
      and Nānmuhan, seated on a lotus,
      Shiva and Indra, the king of the gods,
      come to those hills and worship him.
      Become his slave now.

1057. Kaliyan, the chief of Thirumangai
      surrounded with beautiful strong walls
      composed ten sweet Tamil pāsurams on the god of the gods
      who took the form of a swan to save the Vedas
      and who stays in the temple in the flourishing Thiruvenkaṭam hills
      where over the peaks dark clouds float and lightning flashes.
      If devotees learn and recite these ten everlasting pāsurams,
      they will reach the world in the sky.
