1188. I am your slave and you came and entered my thoughts.
      You are sweet to my mind and I worship you.
      You are my wealth and my precious life,
      the dear god of Thiruvāli
      where everywhere the tender shoots of asoka trees
      bloom like fire with lovely red flowers.

1189. You rest on a snake bed on the ocean
      like a precious blue jewel on a mountain
      and you are also in the mind of me, your slave.
      You are the dear god of Thiruvāli
      where lovely flocks of peacocks dance in the groves
      and the smoke from the sugarcane presses
      rises above like clouds and spreads fragrance everywhere.

1190. You are not concerned
      that today will soon be gone like yesterday.—
      you have entered my heart today
      and you will stay there forever.
      You are the dear god of beautiful Thiruvāli
      where rich paddy grows
      on the banks of the fields filled with water
      and the vālai fish that jump from the hands of farmers
      as they cut the crop fall among the flourishing sugarcane.

1191. You made me forget the beautiful women
      with waists as thin as lightning
      and think only of your divine, eternal feet.
      You are our dear father, the god of beautiful Thiruvāli
      filled with thriving paddy fields, flourishing groves,
      punnai trees, blooming cherundi plants and swans.

1192. I have adorned you with many flower garlands
      and worship your feet, O lord and divine sage
      who destroyed the Asurans who came as marudu trees
      Do not make me suffer,
      O god of beautiful Thiruvāli
      where the sound of songs, conches and drums spreads everywhere
      and the music for dancing fills the place and never stops.

1193. I offered eight kinds of fragrant flowers,
      worshiped your beautiful divine feet and thought only of you,
      who have entered my heart—I will not let you leave.
      You are the dear god of beautiful Thiruvāli
      where Vediyars do morning and evening worship,
      perform sacrifices, recite the four Vedas without stopping
      and teach the Vedas to others.

1194. You who rest on Adisesha on the ocean with rolling waves
      came and entered the mind of me, your slave,
      and I will not let you leave.
      You, all-knowing and virtuous, stay in beautiful Thiruvāli
      where many crabs sleep on cool lotus flowers
      in the shadow of nyazhal and punnai trees that are always in bloom.

1195. You who rest on Adisesha on the wide ocean
      filled with conches on the shore in Kaḍalmallai
      entered my heart and gave me your grace.
      If you want to leave my heart, I will not let you.
      You stay in Thiruvāli where sweet bees
      embrace fragrant shenbaga and jasmine blossoms
      and then go to play among the tender leaves of young palm trees.

1196. O lord, you are the king of the gods, the creator of the Vedas
      and you taught the Vedas to the sages when they worshiped you
      and came to you reciting your thousand names.
      You, the ancient god of beautiful Thiruvāli,
      taught the lives of the divine sages to the world
      and you should teach me also even a little of the Vedas.

1197. Kaliyan with strong mountain-like arms
      composed ten sweet poems on the god Māyan of Thiruvāli
      surrounded with groves where bees embrace one another and sing.
      If devotees learn these pāsurams well
      and sing them and teach them to others, they will go to heaven in the sky.
