1698. O devotees, I have found a way to be saved.
      Our divine strong-shouldered lord became angry,
      bent his bow and made the Rākshasas
      who never tremble in war shiver.
      He is happy when he sees the doe-like glance of Lakshmi
      with hair that swarms with bees.
      He stays in Thirukkaṇṇapuram—
      let us go to there and worship him.

1699. Our lord who carried a strong bow in his hand
      and shot arrows and killed all the Rākshasas in southern Lanka
      and who rode on Garuḍa to fight with strong-armed Māli,
      making his head roll on the ground,
      stays in Thirukkaṇṇapuram.
      Let us go there and worship him.

1700. Our lord who fought with Thādaga,
      the daughter of a Rākshasa family and killed her
      when she disturbed the sacrifices of the sages,
      and protected their sacrifices,

      fought a terrible war with the king of Lanka, afflicting him,
      and brought back his vine-waisted wife Sita

1701. When Rāma went to bring back his wife Sita,
      and shot his arrows at the ocean
      making Varuṇa the god of the sea come to aid him,

      built a bridge over the ocean with stones and trees and helped him
      as the spray from the ocean rose to the sky.

1702. Our lord, the father of Kāma, is the eon itself.
      He took the forms of a turtle, a man-lion and a swan
      to fight with the Asurans and he accepts the sacrifices
      that Vediyars offer with the recitation of the Vedas.
      He went to Lanka protected by strong forts
      and surrounded with high, wave-filled oceans that circle the whole earth
      and cut off the ten heads and twenty hands of its king Ravaṇa
      and he stays happily in Thirukkaṇṇapuram—let us go there and worship him.

1703. O innocent heart, do not worry—
      the results of bad karma will not come to us.
      Our lord who burned up Lanka in the south,
      ruled by his enemy Rākshasas,
      broke the long tusks of the elephant Kuvalayābeeḍam
      and gave his grace to Vānāsuran,

      Let us go there and worship him.

1704. He killed the murderous crocodile
      that caught the elephant Gajendra
      when the elephant went to get flowers from a pond
      blooming with flowers and tender leaves to worship him,
      and he gave the kingdom of Lanka to Vibhishana
      the younger brother of ten-headed Ravaṇa,
      the king of Lanka surrounded with oceans rolling with waves,
      after shooting his arrow and killing Marisan when he came as a golden deer.
      He stays in Thirukkaṇṇapuram—
      let us go there and worship him.

1705. O mind, you are confused—
      do not be plunged in deep sorrow and suffer.
      The lord who destroyed the Marudu trees and killed the angry Asuran,
      fought with seven strong bulls,
      killed the elephant Kuvalayābeeḍam and the wrestlers sent by Kamsan,

      and protected the cows and the cowherds from the storm,
      killed seven strong-legged bulls to marry the vine-waisted Nappinnai,
      went as a messenger to the Kauravas for the Pandavas,
      kicked and broke the cart when Sakaṭasuran appeared in that form and killed him,
      and threw a calf at the vilam tree and killed two Asurans.
      Let us go to Thirukkaṇṇapuram and worship him.

1707. Kaliyan, the generous king of Thirumangai in flourishing Thiruvāli,
      composed ten pāsurams on the lord of Thirukaṇṇapuram
      surrounded with tall palaces over which dark clouds float.
      If devotees learn and recite these poems,
      they will rule this large world as the gods praise them.
