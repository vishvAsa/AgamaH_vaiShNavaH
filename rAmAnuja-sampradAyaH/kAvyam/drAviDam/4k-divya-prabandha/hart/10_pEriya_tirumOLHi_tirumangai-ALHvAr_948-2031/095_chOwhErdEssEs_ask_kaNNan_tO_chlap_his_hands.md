1888. When you ate the butter that Yashoda the cowherdess
      with hair adorned with beautiful flowers churned and kept,
      she was upset, tied you up and hit you.
      You, colored like the ocean with roaring waves, cried and then played.
      Clap your hands,
      you who are colored like a bright sapphire, clap your hands.

1889. You, the most handsome cowherd in the whole world,

1890. When you rolled away the pots
      and swallowed the yogurt and the ghee,
      the cowherd women thought that you had eaten it
      but you crawled as if you knew nothing about it.
      They tied you up with a rope
      and hit you with their hands ornamented with rings.
      O Damodara! Clap your hands!

      on your parents’ feet and released them,

      Everyone was afraid of going near the cheating devil Putana
      when she came to you
      but without anyone to help you, you approached her
      and drank her poisonous milk.

      I will give you enough snacks, aval and appams
      to fill your stomach.
      You who wear a dark karuviḷai flower in your long hair
      are a fighting bull, Kovalan the son of Nandagopan.
      Clap your hands!
      You danced on a pot. Clap your hands!

1894. When Bakāsuran came as a bird you split open his beak,
      and you knocked down the blooming kuṛundam tree.

      You are the child who drank milk from my breasts.
      Clap your hands!
      You drank milk from the breast of the devil Putana.

      came in the middle of the night
      when your mother and others were sleeping

      Clap your hands!
      You have a dark color. Clap your hands!

1896. You were a naughty child and stole butter.
      You kicked Sakaṭāsuran when he came as a cart
      and when devil Putanā came as a mother,
      you drank her poisonous milk and killed her.
      You are generous! Clap your hands!
      You have a dark color. Clap your hands!

1897. Kaliyan, the chief of Thirumangai,
      is generous as a rain-giving cloud.
      O dear lord, you stay in the poet’s mind always.
      Your eyes are as beautiful as lotuses
      and you are adorned with cool thulasi garlands.
      Clap your hands!
      You have a broad chest. Clap your hands!
