1088. In Kaḍalmallai Thalasayanam I saw the lord, strong as a bull,
      sweet as the nectar from the milky ocean,
      generous as the Karpaga tree, bright like a golden hill,
      sweet as sugarcane in the hearts of his devotees,
      precious as a coral pillar,
      who swallowed all the worlds and spit them out,
      split open the mouth of the Asuran that came as a horse,
      broke the tusks of the elephant Kuvalayābeeḍam
      and walked between the marudam trees and broke them
      and who saved Gajendra from the crocodile.

1089. Don’t believe in those who do tapas to other gods and serve them
      and don’t trust their false books as true
      or believe in their teachings and destroy yourselves.
      Come to our dark cloud-colored lord,
      who is a precious pearl and good tapas
      worshiped by all the ganas in Kāṇḍavanam where he burned Indra’s gardens.
      I saw him in Kaḍalmallai Thalasayanam.

1090. The dark cloud-colored lord, the protector of the world
      who drank milk from the breasts of Putanā and killed her
      and grazed the calves and played with them,
      is himself the three gods, Nānmuhan, Shiva and Indra, but different than them.
      He will show the divine path for his devotees
      so they can go to the Thanjai temple and worship him.
      I saw the lord who will come to the earth on a horse as Kalki
      in Kadalmallai Thalasayanam surrounded with thick groves
      .
1091. In Kaḍalmallai Thalasayanam surrounded with thick groves
      I saw the god who drank milk from the breasts of Putanā and killed her,
      broke the tusks of the strong elephant Kuvalayaabeedam
      and stole the butter that Yashoda, his doe-eyed mother, churned and kept in the uṛi.
      He, sweet nectar for Vediyars,danced the kuravai dance on a pot
      and carried Govardhana mountain to protect the cows and the cowherds.

1092. In Kadalmallai Thalasayanam surrounded with thick groves
      I saw the sapphire-colored lord with four mountain-like arms,
      the beloved of the earth goddess who embraces her arms,
      broke the cart and killed Sakaṭasuran,
      lay on a banyan leaf when he was a child,
      went as a messenger for the Pandavas to the Kauravas
      and fought and killed the wrestlers sent by Kamsan.

1093. Our lord, my father who rests on many-headed Adisesha on the ocean,
      broke the tusks of the elephant Kuvalayābeeḍam,
      took the form of a boar with curving tusks,
      split open the underworld and brought the earth goddess up,
      and measured the earth and the sky
      with his two feet at Mahābali’s sacrifice.
      He stays in Kaḍalmallai Thalasayanam
      surrounded with thick groves and I saw him there.

1094. The lord who rests on the roaring ocean and rides on Garuḍa
      crushed the mountain-like arms of the strong undefeated Rākshasas
      and killed their king of Lanka, Rāvaṇa,
      took the form of a man-lion and split open the chest of the Asuran Hiraṇyan,
      and drank the poisonous milk of Putanā and killed her .
      He stays in Kaḍalmallai Thalasayanam surrounded with thick groves,
      and in the hearts of those who think of him
      and I searched for him and found him there.

1095. He came as Mohini and gave nectar to the gods,
      cheating the Asurans when the milky ocean was churned,
      and he took the form of a mighty man-lion with teeth like crescent moons
      and split open the chest of Hiraṇyan.
      As large as Meyyam mountain, he rests on the ocean
      surrounded by cool abundant water on many-headed Adisesha.
      The lord who has long beautiful lotus eyes
      stays in Kaḍalmallai Thalasayanam surrounded with thick groves
      where all devotees think of him and there is no limit to his fame.
      I found him there.

1096. The lord whose feet his devotees praise
      measured the world at the sacrifice of Mahābali
      and he killed the king of the Raksasas of the southern Lanka.
      He taught the sages, all the four ancient Vedas,
      the five sacrifices, the six Upanishads and all the other sastras
      and he stays in Kaḍalmallai Thalasayanam surrounded with thick groves,
      and I, his devotee, saw him there.

1097. Kaliyan, a warrior in battles with strong elephants dripping with ichor,
      composed ten sweet musical pāsurams
      on the god of Kadalmallai Thalasayanam
      who rests on the snake Adisesha on the ocean,
      killed Hiraṇyan, the king of the Asurans
      and went between the marudu trees, angrily killing the Asurans.
      If devotees learn and recite these ten pāsurams well
      they will not have the results of their karma.
