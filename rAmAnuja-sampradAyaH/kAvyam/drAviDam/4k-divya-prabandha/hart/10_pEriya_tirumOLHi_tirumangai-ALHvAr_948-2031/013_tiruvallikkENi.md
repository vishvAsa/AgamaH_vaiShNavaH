1068. The lord fought and killed Kamsan, the wrestlers
      and the elephant Kuvalayabeeḍam and its mahout,
      removed the curse of Shiva, the destroyer of the three forts,
      helped Arjuna and drove the chariot in the Bharatha war,
      defeating the enemies of the Pandavas,
      and as Rama, he obeyed the orders of his stepmother
      and gave up the kingdom of Ayodhya to his younger brother Bharathan.
      He stays in Thiruvallikkeṇi and I saw him there.

1069. Our god, the bull-like son of Nandan,
      the ruler of the sky, the faultless fruit that sages enjoy,
      the first one on earth, as sweet as nectar,
      the Vedas, the sweet taste of the Vedas, and their fruition that the sages enjoy
      stays in Thiruvallikkeṇi
      where peacocks as beautiful as women dance
      on the lovely porches. I saw him there.

1070. The lord, Yama for the Asurans,
      drank the poisonous milk from Putanā’s breasts
      and killed her when she came as a mother to cheat him
      and took the form of Mohini when the milky ocean was churned
      took the nectar and gave it to the gods
      as the Sāraṇar and the Siddhas praised him in amazement.
      He stays in Thiruvallikkeni and I saw him there.

1071. Our lord Kaṇṇan saved the cows and the cowherds
      when they worshiped him saying,
      “O dear lord! Give us your grace and protect us
      and our cows from the storm!”,
      carried Govardhana mountain as an umbrella
      and saved them from the storm sent by Indra
      when he was angry because they had not performed
      their pujas to him immediately.
      He stays in Thiruvallikkeṇi and I saw him there.

1072. Thirumāl, the king of the world, the beloved of Lakshmi,
      the husband of Nappinnai, the cowherd girl, and a companion for all,
      who went as a messenger to the Kauravas for the Pandavas
      and was the help of my father and the father of my father,
      stays in Thiruvallikkeṇi temple and I saw him there.

1073. Kaṇṇan came and helped Draupadi
      when Duhshasanan, the younger son of blind Dhrtarashtran
      and younger brother of the king of kings Duryodhanan
      took her to the Kauravas’ assembly and tried to disgrace her,
      drove the chariot in the Bharatha war for Arjuna
      and killed all the hundred Kauravas in the battle,
      widowing their women whose hair was fragrant with sandal.
      He stays in Thiruvallikkeṇi and I saw him there.

1074. As Rama he fought with Ravaṇa, the king of Lanka,
      while Bharathan, Satrughnan, Lakshamanan and Sita prayed for him night and day.
      He stays in Thiruvallikkeṇi and I saw him there
      where kuravam flowers bloom in a cool thick grove
      where the rays of the sun do not enter
      and cuckoo birds sing and peacocks dance.

1075. When Prahladan, the son of Hiraṇyan
      came home from school and recited god's thousand names,
      his father, the Asuran Hiraṇyan, was enraged.
      Prahladan claimed the god would appear wherever a devotee wished
      and Hiraṇyan, without thinking, broke open a pillar,
      and the god came out in the form of a heroic lion
      with teeth like crescent moons, fiery eyes
      and a gaping mouth and killed him.
      I saw that divine one in Thiruvallikkeṇi.

1076. When the elephant Gajendra entered a pond
      where fish frolicked in the forest
      to pick some fresh flowers to worship the god,
      a crocodile caught his legs,
      and, terrified, he raised his trunk and called Kaṇṇan.
      The god came riding on Garuḍa and threw his discus,
      killed the crocodile and saved Gajendra.
      I saw him, as beautiful as a peacock,
      in Thiruvallikkeṇi filled with large palaces
      and surrounded by groves dripping with honey.

1077. The famous poet Kaliyan,
      the chief of Thirumangai filled with beautiful palaces,
      composed a garland of ten pāsurams on the god of Thiruvallikkeṇi
      filled with maṇḍapams, tall palaces with porches,
      forts, ponds and cool groves
      constructed by the southern king of the Thondai country.
      If devotees learn and recite these ten pāsurams,
      they will reach the world of the gods in the sky and rule there happily.
