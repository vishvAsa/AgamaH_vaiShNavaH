1898. Is there a māyam like this?
      The lord Nārāyaṇan came to the earth as a man
      and taught the Vedas to the sages
      so that the Vedas would not disappear.
      With his golden throat he swallowed
      the hot sun, earth, rising oceans, mountains and fire
      and kept them in his stomach.
      See, now he has stolen butter
      and the cowherd women have caught him and tied him up
      and he cannot move.

1899. The lord who churned the sounding milky ocean
      using Mandara mountain for a churning stick
      shot with a sling at the Kuni’s back, making it bend,
      and then shot again and straightened it.
      He swallowed the ancient seven worlds, the seven mountains
      and the seven oceans where fish swim and kept them in his stomach.
      See, now he has stolen butter
      and the cowherd women have caught him and tied him up
      and he cannot move.

1900. When the gods in the sky were worried
      that the Asuran Madhukaiṭabha had become a terrible enemy
      and that he would fight them,
      they went to the god who carries a bent bow,
      worshiped him and asked for his help
      and our dear lord destroyed the Asuran and saved them.
      With his sharp claws he split open
      the mountain-like body of the Asuran Hiraṇyaṇ with sword-like teeth.
      See, now he has stolen the butter
      and the cowherd women have caught and tied him up
      and he cannot move.

1901. When the gods in the sky grew tired
      fighting with their enemy Hiraṇyan and went to the god
      and asked him for refuge, our god Thirumāl
      split open the chest of Hiraṇyan
      and joyfully gave his grace to the gods in the sky.
      He went as a dwarf to the famous heroic king Mahābali,
      cheated him, took his land
      and measured the earth and the sky with his two feet.
      See, now he has stolen the butter
      and the cowherd women have caught him and tied him up
      and he cannot move.

1902. Wishing to remove the troubles of the gods,
      he went as a dwarf to Mahābali’s sacrifice,
      grew tall and measured the earth and the sky.
      He, the ruler of all the seven worlds,
      gives his grace to his devotees and protects them
      so that the messengers of Yama will not approach them.
      See, now he has stolen the butter
      and the cowherd women have caught him and tied him up
      and he cannot move.

1903. Our divine lord Thirumāl,
      who protects his devotees
      and removes the desires of evil passions for them if they worship him,
      cut off with his mazhu weapon the thousand arms of the angry Asuran Kārtaviryan
      when he came to fight with him.
      See, now he has stolen the butter
      and the cowherd women have caught him and tied him up
      and he cannot move.

1904. Our lord, the creator of the world
      who removes the sorrows of his devotees if they worship him
      gathered a monkey army, built a bridge over the ocean with stones,
      crossed it and destroyed his enemies in Lanka
      because the Rakshasas did not understand his strength.
      See, now he has stolen the butter
      and the cowherd women have caught him and tied him up
      and he cannot move.

1905. As Rama, the lord broke the bow that was born with Sita,
      and he married her who had precious ornaments and curly soft hair.
      When he was living happily with her as a prince,
      she was abducted by Ravaṇa, the king of Lanka.
      He built a bridge, crossed the ocean, fought with Rāvaṇa,
      cut off his ten strong heads and his arms and legs
      and brought his wife back.
      See, now he has stolen the butter
      and the cowherd women have caught him and tied him up
      and he cannot move.

1906. When the Asuran Kesi came as a tawny horse,
      he split open his mouth and killed him,
      he broke the seven marā trees with his strong bow
      and he cut off the nose and ears of the Raksasi Surpanakha
      who was as large as a mountain.
      See, now he has stolen butter
      and the cowherd women have caught him and tied him up
      and he cannot move.

1907. Kaliyan, the chief of ancient Thirumangai
      surrounded with flourishing fields,
      composed a garland of Tamil pāsurams
      worshiping the feet of the lord and describing his deeds,
      how he was tied to a mortar by the cowherd women
      when he stole milk, yogurt and ghee from the uṛi,
      swallowed them and filled his stomach,
      and how even when the cowherd women saw him,
      he was not worried and did not feel shy.
      If devotees learn and recite these pāsurams
      they will have no troubles in their lives and will find happiness.
      They will reach the heaven that is above even the world of the gods.
