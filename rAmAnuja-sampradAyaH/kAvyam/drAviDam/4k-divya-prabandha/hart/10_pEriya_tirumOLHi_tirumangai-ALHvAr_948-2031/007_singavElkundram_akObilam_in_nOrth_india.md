1008. Our god who became angry at Hiraṇyan,
      went to him as a man-lion
      and with his sharp claws split open the chest of the Asuran
      making the people of this wide world frightened to see him
      stays in Singavelkundram
      where red-eyed āḷis bring the ivory of elephants,
      place it in front of him with devotion and worship him.

1009. Our father who took the form of a man-lion
      with a huge mouth and sharp teeth, went to Hiraṇyan
      and with his sharp claws split open his chest
      stays in Singaveḷkundram where drums roar
      and hunters with bows in their hands
      are raucous as they fight wayfarers.

1010. Our dear father who took the form of a man-lion
      with a huge mouth and sharp teeth,
      went to the Asuran Hiranyan
      and split open his chest with his sharp claws
      stays in Singaveḷkundram
      where there are only exhausted animals,
      broken hills and burnt bamboo.

1011. Our dear father who took the form of a man-lion,
      went to the Asuran Hiraṇyan whose conquering spear was swift
      and split open his chest with his sharp claws
      stays in Singavelkundram
      where wolves and eagles wander all day
      with the sun and the blowing wind
      and no one can enter except divine creatures.

1012. The faultless lord who took the form of a man-lion
      with a huge mouth and sharp teeth
      and went to the Asuran Hiraṇyan and killed him
      stays in Singavelkundram
      where the wind blows fire everywhere making it rise to the sky
      and it is not easy for people to enter but only for the gods.

1013. Our father who took the form of a man-lion
      with a huge mouth, sharp teeth and eyes like burning fire
      and angrily went to Hiraṇyan and split open his heart
      as the gods looked on in terror and ran away everywhere
      stays in Singavelkundram
      where tigers that have long fire-like mouths
      hide among the bamboo thickets
      looking for the paths where elephants walk.

1014. Our father who went as a man-lion to Hiraṇyan
      and split open his chest as his anger rose to the sky
      and spread over all the three worlds
      and every other place, terrifying everyone,
      stays in Singavelkundram,
      where people cannot enter at all
      and there are is burning fire, stones,
      and hunters with cruel bows

1015. The place where the four-faced Nānmuhan and Shiva
      with trembling tongues worshiped the lord
      when he came in the form of a man-lion
      is Singavelkundram where the dried bean pods
      of vākai trees split open and rattle
      and the bamboo that grows on the hills burns
      and the fire from it rises to the sky, making it red.

1016. Our thousand-armed god, the beloved of Lakshmi,
      stays in Singavelkundram
      where nelli trees grow abundantly
      and their roots spread and break the stones
      and the palm trees rustle in the wind
      and the bees swarm always,
      making the sound “chil, chil.”
      O good heart, let us go there and worship our lord.

1017. Kaliyan the poet,
      the generous chief of Thirumangai
      adorned with a garland swarming with bees
      composed a beautiful garland of Tamil pāsurams
      on the god of Singavelkundram
      where red-eyed lions place food
      at his feet and worship him.
