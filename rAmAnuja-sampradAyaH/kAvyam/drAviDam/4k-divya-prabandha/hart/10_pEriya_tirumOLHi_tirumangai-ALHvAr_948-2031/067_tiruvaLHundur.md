+++

1608. You, our lovely Kaṇṇan, the wealth of all wealth,
      carry a strong shining discus
      and embrace beautiful Lakshmi on your chest.
      You are the king of the gods, the unique one
      and you swallowed the world.
      Always, the feelings of the five senses enter me and torment me—
      even one of them is enough to hurt me
      and so, frightened of them, I come to you, my father.
      You stay in Thiruvazundur facing west.

1609. You came into my heart and stay firmly there
      with the soft-fingered earth goddess lovely as a doll,
      ornamented with beautiful armlets.
      Dark-colored and shining as bright as a cloud,
      you are the Chandogya Upanishad, the Rig Veda,
      the Taittiriya Upanishad and the god of the Sama Veda.
      You are my mother, O tall Neḍumal
      and you stay in Thiruvazundur facing west.

1610. The lord who has long arms that carry
      a discus smeared with oil and a conch
      made me, his slave, be born in this evil world and do wrong.
      The cravings of the five senses entered my heart made me proud and sinful
      and, afraid to enjoy this illusory life, I came to you.
      I do not know anything except your feet,
      O father who stay in Thiruvazundur facing west.

1611. You, the Mādhavan, the Madhusudanan
      the highest, the king of the gods in the sky,
      worshiped and praised by the five Pandavas,
      the Chola kings and all the other kings of the earth,
      bestow the boons that they want.
      I have no help but you, O man-lion, Nāraṇan, our Nambi of Naṛaiyur.
      You stay in Thiruvazundur facing west .

1612. You took the form of a man-lion
      and fought with Hiraṇyan and split open his chest,
      and as a cowherd you, the good, pure and highest god,
      carried Govardhana mountain to protect the cows and the cowherds.
      I understand the troubles of Kaliyuga
      and know what my fate will be.
      You are the world and I know nothing other than your feet,
      O my father, my resfuge,
      you stay in Thiruvazundur facing west.

1613. When you were given good yogurt and ghee
      you ate them and laughed,
      but then your mother Yasodha tied you to a mortar
      and you cried but you were strong enough to pull the mortar.
      You are a child for the people of the earth
      and the god of gods in the sky
      and you are the four yugas,
      Krta, Treta, Dvapara and the Kaliyuga.
      I know nothing other than your feet,
      my father who stay in Thiruvazundur facing west.

1614. You, dark as a cloud and colored like the shining ocean,
      were angry at Hiranyan and went to him as a man lion and killed him.
      You, my father, swallowed all the seven worlds
      and you fought with the seven bulls and defeated them.
      I thought if I were patient and had no desire
      to be involved in the pleasures of the senses,
      they would go away but instead they hurt me and ate me up.
      Scared I came to you, my father, lord of Thiruvazundur facing west .

1615. You, the tall Nambi, take away the troubles of life
      and I stay here thinking only of you
      The evil pleasures of the five bull-like senses
      entered me but I escaped them
      and I have come here to your feet to worship you.
      Give me food and clothes
      and your grace and make me your devotee
      so that I may serve you, my father
      and god of Thiruvazhundur facing west.

1616. When the pleasures of the five senses
      took over my body and wanted to rule me,
      they exclaimed, “Give me food and clothes!”
      refusing to leave me and causing me unbearable pain.
      You, are the faultless Neḍumāl carrying an eagle flag
      and resting on the bed that is a snake spitting fire.
      O Thirumāl, I, your devotee, do not know what I should do now.
      Show pity on me and give me your grace.
      O my father, you stay in Thiruvazhundur facing west.

1617. Strong-armed Kaliyan,
      the king of Thirumangai in Thiruvali surrounded with forts,
      composed a pure garland of ten Tamil poems,
      a chain of precious diamonds with beautiful words.
      If devotees learn and recite these poems,
      they will happily rule the world as kings
      under a precious white royal umbrella.
