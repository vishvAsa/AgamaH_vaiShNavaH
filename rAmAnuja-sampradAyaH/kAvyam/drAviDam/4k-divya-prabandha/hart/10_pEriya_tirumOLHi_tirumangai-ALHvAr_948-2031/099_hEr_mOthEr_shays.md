1932. Her mother says,
      “You, the heroic lord, burnt Lanka
      and you drank the milk of the devil Putana
      when she came in the middle of the night and killed her.
      Our young girls decorated with flowers dripping with honey love you,
      but you ignore their love and don’t care about them—
      you’re just like the mothers who take away a cup of milk
      from their children’s hands whenever they want
      and don’t worry about it.
      What can I say about you?”

1933. Her mother says,
      “You, the ocean-colored lord of Thirumalai,
      danced the kuthu dance in the middle of the village,
      you subdued the seven bulls to marry Nappinnai,
      and you protected the terrified cowherds and the cows
      from the storm with Govardhana mountain.
      When you made my daughter’s bangles grow loose and fall,
      you did it as if you were taking honey from the murungai tree
      that is in the front of your temple.
      Is this because you have so much strength from your heroic deeds?”

1934. Her mother says,
      “ O lovely god, you have the color of a dark cloud,
      and the mighty discus and conch you carry in your hands
      make you even more heroic.
      My dear daughter who is precious as a garland of pearls
      is adorned with beautiful ornaments.
      She is as sweet as the nectar from the large ocean.
      You think that she is like a sweet ball of jaggery in your hands.
      Is this because you are heroic and conquered Kamsan?”

1935. Her mother says,
      “You gave part of your body to Shiva
      who has round arms and wears a deer skin.
      Your strong hands killed Narakāsuran.
      You have stolen the beautiful color of my daughter
      whose hair is decorated with alli garlands.
      You stand in front of her always and don’t go away.
      What can I say? O Nambi, you seem to think she is like a stick
      in the hands of your servants. What can I say?”

1936. Her mother says,
      “Alas, you don’t think of the beauty
      of my daughter who speaks sweetly
      and whose hair is decorated with garlands that drip honey.
      You say she is not even as good as a berry fruit lying on a path.
      I don’t understand.
      Is it because you are heroic and rode on a chariot
      and destroyed the pride of the kings in Bharatha war,
      sending them on the path to the sky?”

1937. Her mother says,
      “What is this you are doing now?
      You made the white conch bangles of my daughter grow loose
      whose mouth is as red as the petals of a murukkam flower,
      and you stand in front of her and don’t leave.
      Is that because with your bow
      you destroyed the pride of the king of Lanka
      surrounded with beautiful forts and made the gods serve you?
      O father! Why should anyone need to throw an axe
      just to make an erukkam leaf fall?”

1938. Her mother says,
      “O lord, you are our father with the color of the large ocean.
      You stole the shining color of my daughter
      whose glance is as soft as a doe’s,
      and you keep standing in front of her always, not going away.
      Why should anyone need to use even a small stick
      to make an egg break for the chick to emerge?
      Do you do these things because you are heroic
      and used your axe to cut off the thousand strong arms of Bānāsuran
      who ruled the world surrounded by oceans,
      making many kings riding strong chariots with lovely wheels
      come and obey him?”

1939. Her mother says,
      “You, colored like the dark ocean,
      have not thought of the pride of my daughter
      whose eyes are beautiful
      and whose garlanded hair swarms with bees.
      Why did you do this?
      It is because you are proud that you split open
      the chest of Hiranyan, your enemy,
      and because you became angry at Vāli and killed him
      when you felt compassion for Sugreeva?
      Do you think my daughter is only like the moisture
      that comes inside your mouth in your cheek?”

1940. Her mother says,
      “Are you proud because you are water, fire, sky,
      the large world and wind?
      Or do you think that my daughter
      with a beautiful garland in her hair has no one but you?
      I have done bad karma.
      My daughter is as precious as the nectar
      that came from the milky ocean.
      Do you think she is like the garden of a Vediyan
      who gives his attention only to making his sacrificial fire
      and gives no care to anything else?”

1941. Kaliyan the chief of Thirumangai
      with a spear in his hand
      overcame his desires for the world
      and worshiped the feet of the god truly
      and the lord gave his grace to him.
      If devotees learn and recite these ten pāsurams
      that praise the lord who is adorned
      with fresh thulasi garlands with opening buds,
      their devotion and wealth will increase.
