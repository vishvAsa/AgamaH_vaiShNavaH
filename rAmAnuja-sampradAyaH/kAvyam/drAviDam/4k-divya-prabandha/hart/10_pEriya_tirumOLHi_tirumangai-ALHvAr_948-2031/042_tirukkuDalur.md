1358. Kudalur where beautiful girls
      with fingers as lovely as kāndal buds
      wear soft dresses and spread the fragrance from their hair everywhere
      is the place of the god
      who does not know his own greatness
      and went as a messenger for the Pandavas.

1359. Kuḍalur where bees drink sweet fragrant honey
      and sing kurinji songs
      is the place of the beautiful god
      who fought with the seven humped bulls
      and married Nappinnai, the daughter of a fisherman.

1360. Kuḍalur where the cheating cranes
      steal kāyal fish in the fields is the place of the god
      who ate yogurt when he was a child
      and now has entered heart of me, his devotee.

1361. Kuḍalur where the kol bees sing and drink honey from the flowers
      that adorn the hair of the farmers plowing the wet lands
      is the place of our father who, as if he were Yama,
      went as a dwarf, took three feet of land from king Mahabali
      and measured the earth and the sky at the sacrifice of the king.

1362. Kuḍalur where the clouds thunder
      and kendai fish frolic and glisten
      in the water in the flourishing fields
      is the place of the god where devotees praised him
      as the moon and the shining sun went around him
      when he grew to the sky at the sacrifice of Mahābali.

1363. Kuḍalur where mangoes fall from their trees
      everywhere onto mounds of sand
      is the place of the god who aided Shiva,
      the destroyer of the sacrifice of Daksha, removing his pain.

1364. Kuḍalur where cool tender jasmine plants
      grow abundantly and embrace kurundam trees
      is the place of him who swallowed the world,
      the mountains and the cool dark oceans.

1365. Kuḍalur where trees with tender coconuts
      bend down to the earth
      is where the god of Thiruneermalai stays
      and stags embrace their lovely does and live happily.

1366. Kuḍalur where a kendai fish goes near a thazhai flower
      and is frightened that it might be a crane
      is the place of the matchless lord
      who came and entered this slave’s heart
      and melts it with abundant love for him.

1367. Kaiyan composed ten pāsurams in Tamil on Kuḍalur
      where Kaṇṇan, colored like the ocean or a kāvi flower,
      stays and shines.
      If devotees learn and recite these pāsurams
      the results of their karma will not come to them.
