1618. The Māyon who rests on Adisesha on the wide ocean
      rolling with waves,
      as Lakshmi and the earth goddess
      stroke his divine golden feet and sages praise him
      stays in beautiful, flourishing Thiruvazundur
      where famous learned Vediyars
      skilled in the four Vedas perform the five sacrifices
      and are as divine as Nānmuhan himself.

1619. When the eon ended and all the seven worlds
      were covered with darkness
      and the sages and the Asurans were terrified,
      our highest god took the form of a horse
      and brought all the four Vedas up from the ocean
      and taught them to the sages.
      See, the god of the gods stays happily in rich Thiruvazhundur
      where the ears of good paddy swing in the wind like fans
      and conches in the water sound
      and male swans sit with their mates on the lovely lotuses.

1620. When the strong crocodile caught Gajendra, the king of elephants,
      he called to you loudly, saying,
      “You are the shining light of the world, as bright as its flowers,”
      and you, faultless, went and saved him and gave him your grace.
      See, you are the god of the gods
      and you stay happily in beautiful Thiruvazhundur
      where the Ponni river brings fragrant sandalwood from the mountains
      along with gold and jewels as it fills the fields and the channels with water and increases the richness of the place.

1621. He took the divine form of a strong-eyed boar
      that looked like a hill decorated with anklets and ornaments
      and dug up the earth and brought up
      the shining earth goddess on his tusks.
      See, he is the king of the gods
      who stays in beautiful rich Thiruvazhundur
      surrounded with water where areca nut trees grow
      and winged bees sing in the groves
      as cuckoo birds coo and peacocks dance.

1622. As a heroic man-lion he split open the strong chest of Hiraṇyan,
      and when the devil Putanā came in the form of a mother to cheat him
      he drank her poisonous milk and killed her.
      See, he is the Māyon and he stays happily in rich Thiruvazhundur
      where beautiful women come with their friends,
      their arms ornamented with round bangles, walking like swans
      and teaching sweet words to their emerald-colored parrots
      with mouths like red kovvai fruits.

1623. When the gods were afflicted by Māhabali,
      Thirumāl, my chief with an unmatched discus,
      went as a dwarf to Mahābali and asked for three feet of land,
      and when he received the boon,
      he measured the world and the sky with his two feet.
      He stays happily in prosperous, beautiful Thiruvazhundur
      surrounded with groves dripping with honey
      and filled with precious palaces where famous Vediyars,
      praised from the ancient times, recite the Vedas.

1624. To bring back his wife Sita
      who plays with a soft ball with her hands,
      our lord shot his killing arrows
      and cut off the indestructible arms and heads of Rāvaṇa, the king of Lanka
      where the sun, the god of the day, cannot enter.
      He stays happily in rich Thiruvazhundur
      where good-natured Vediyars,
      skilled in pure Tamil and the northern arts,
      perform sacrifices with rising smoke and resemble Nānmuhan himself.

1625. The Māyon broke the tusks
      of the elephant Kuvalayābeeḍam and killed it,
      conquered the young seven bulls,
      danced the Kuravai kuthu dance
      and ate the yogurt and butter that Yasodha kept,
      her hair adorned with fragrant flowers.
      He stays happily in rich Thiruvazhundur
      surrounded with precious golden walls
      and groves where banana and shining puham trees
      flourish everywhere and red corals and emeralds are bountiful.

1626. See, the tall wide-shouldered lord,
      the god of the gods, famous and victorious
      holding a discus in his beautiful hand,
      fought with the evil Kamsan and conquered the wrestlers sent by him,
      fought with the strong elephant Kuvalayābeeḍam
      and killed Sakaṭāsuran when he came as a cart.
      He stays happily in beautiful rich Thiruvazhundur
      with (ceeTeeṛu) groves and beautiful streets CHECK
      where the porches are studded with jewels
      and lovely women adorned with flowers in their hair
      learn dancing on those porches at festival times.

1627. He, the highest god and the king of the gods,
      who took the forms of a boar, a fish, and a man-lion
      and created, protected, swallowed and spat out the world
      stays in Aṇiyazundur happily
      while Indra, the king of the gods,
      Nānmuhan and Murugan worship his feet.
      Kaliyan the poet, the strong king of Thiruvāli with a long spear
      composed ten musical pāsurams on the god of Aṇiyazhundur.
      If devotees learn and recite these ten pāsurams well
      they will be like gods and rule this world
      surrounded by the sounding oceans.
