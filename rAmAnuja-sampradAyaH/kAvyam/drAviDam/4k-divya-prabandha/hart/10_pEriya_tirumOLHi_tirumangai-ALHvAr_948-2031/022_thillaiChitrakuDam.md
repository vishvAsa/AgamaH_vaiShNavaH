1158. O devotees, if you want to rule the world of the gods,
      you do not have to starve and suffer and do tapas
      and all of your five senses do not have to be restrained.
      Just go to Thillai Chitrakuḍam
      where peacocks dance, fish frolic in the water of the springs,
      bees drink honey and flags flutter on the tops of palaces.

1159. O devotees, if you want to reach him
      who embraces Lakshmi on his chest,
      you do not have to eat vegetables and fruits
      or perform tapas by standing for long periods of time
      and undergo the five types of sacrifices with fire.
      Just go to the famous Thillai Chitrakuḍam
      and worship him where good Maṛaiyāḷars
      recite the Vedas always and make sacrifices with fire that rises high,
      and just keep the lord in your heart.

1160. O devotees, if you want to see the lord who
      went through the ocean to the underground world as a boar
      and rescued the earth goddess stolen by an Asuran,
      just go to Thillai Chitrakudam, the sacred temple
      surrounded with jeweled palaces covered with pure gold
      where the Pallava king with a large army
      brought gold, pearls and jewels and worshiped him.

1161. O devotees, you say that your sorrow-filled births will go away
      if you recite the divine names of the lord
      who went as a dwarf and asked for three feet of land
      at the sacrifice of Mahābali
      and measured the world and the sky with his two feet.
      If you want to reach him, just go to Thillai Chitrakuḍam
      where Thirumāl with divine Lakshmi
      rests happily on Adisesha on the dark ocean and worship him,
      and you will not be born again.

1162. O devotees, if you want to reach the lord
      who came as the sage Parasuraman carrying an axe
      and fought with many kings to save this world encircled by the seas,
      just go to famous Thillai Chitrakuḍam
      surrounded with blooming groves
      where he stays with the earth goddess and Lakshmi
      as the goddess of fame shines everywhere.

1163. O devotees, if you want to live
      thinking only of the dark-colored lord shining like a jewel,
      who as Rama shot his sharp arrows at the ocean
      and built a bridge to go to Lanka,
      just go to beautiful Thillai Chitrakuḍam
      where Vediyars recite the Vedas that they know so well
      and young girls listen to their recitation and sing after them
      while parrots hear the girls and chant with them.

1164. If you want to keep in your heart the lord
      who loved the soft arms of Nappinnai,
      the cowherd girl adorned with jasmine flowers on her hair,
      and the divine Lakshmi,
      born from the milky ocean rolling with waves,
      whom he keeps on his divine chest,
      just go to sacred Thillai Chitrakudam
      surrounded by the divine river Veḷḷāru
      that carries elephants’ tusks and sandalwood from the hills
      while the moon circles around that lovely place.

1165. O devotees, if you want to reach the ornamented feet
      with sounding anklets of the Māyan who grazed the cows
      and carried Govardhana mountain as an umbrella
      to rescue the cows when they suffered in a terrible storm,
      just go to flourishing Thillai Chitrakuḍam
      where the god of gods, the divine light, stays,
      worshiped by three thousand Vediyars,
      the learned of the Vedas.

1166. O devotees, if you want to remove the karma
      that you have collected because of your passion for women
      with dark eyes that are like spears for fighting,
      and want to reach the famous world
      that is above even the world of the gods,
      just go to shining Thillai Chitrakuḍam
      where kayal fish frolic in the seeded fields,
      beautiful neelam flowers bloom everywhere
      and the Veḷḷāru river flows with abundant water and brings pearls.

1167. Kaliyan, the generous poet who gives like rain
      composed a garland of ten Tamil pāsurams
      on Thirumāl so the people of the world may hear them and be happy.
      If devotees learn and recite these ten musical pāsurams
      on the lord of beautiful Thillai Thiruchitrakuḍam
      surrounded with lovely groves and the sea rolling with waves,
      they will go to heaven and stay under the feet of him
      who measured the world and the sky in two steps,
      and they will live for many ages.
