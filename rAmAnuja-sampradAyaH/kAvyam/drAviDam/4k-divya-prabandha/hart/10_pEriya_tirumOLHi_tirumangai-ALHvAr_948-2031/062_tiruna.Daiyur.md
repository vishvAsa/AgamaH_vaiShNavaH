1558. When I praise you saying,
      “You took the form of a swan and a boar.
      You, a thief, entered my heart,”
      my eyes fill with tears
      and my heart melts and thinks of you only.
      I will not approach anyone but you, O Nambi, god of Naṛaiyur.

1559. As a strong man-lion that never retreats you killed Hiraṇyan.
      You came to me and entered my heart.
      I will not sing and praise others with my pāsurams,
      I will not approach anyone except you, O Nambi, god of Naṛaiyur.

1560. My father and mother left this world
      after they gave birth to me.
      You are father and mother for me, your devotee.
      You are a beautiful bright light,
      O Nambi, god of Naṛaiyur. I will not praise anything happily
      except your beautiful dark color.

1561. You slept as a little baby
      on the banyan leaf and swallowed the world.
      You entered my heart and stayed there,
      but I, your slave, did not know you were there.
      Now your devotee, I have realized that you are in my heart.
      You are our Nambi and you stay in Naraiyur
      surrounded with groves dripping with honey.

1562. O tall one, it is hard
      for the gods to know who you are and to praise you.
      I knew that you protect your devotees
      if they come to you for refuge.
      You entered the heart of me, your slave,
      and I will not allow you to leave it.
      All the days I live will be only to praise you,
      O Nambi, god of Naraiyur.

1563. My father, his father and our ancestors
      for seven generations and others before them all served you
      and they were your slaves.
      You entered my heart
      and I will not let you go away.
      You, my dear life, my king, my father,
      gave your grace to me without refusing,
      O Nambi, god of Naraiyur.

1564. You cut off the thousand arms of Bānasuran
      terrifying all other kings when they saw it.
      You have entered my heart
      and I will not allow you to go
      to another person’s evil heart and stay there.
      I attracted you and have kept you in my heart.
      You go to stay in the hearts of good people
      O Nambi, god of Naraiyur.

1565. Always the gods with eyes that do not blink
      place golden blossoms at your feet.
      They carry flowers in their hands
      and come to worship your ankleted feet.
      Now you have entered my heart
      and I will not allow you to leave.
      O Nambi, you stay in Naṛaiyur
      where the bees plunge into beautiful buds.

1566. You gave me this body made of flesh
      and I have suffered in this world.
      Now you, sweet as the clear juice of sweet sugarcane, are mine.
      I am your slave and you have entered my heart.
      I thought of you always and reached you,
      O Nambi of Naṛaiyur.

1567. Kaliyan, the chief of Thirumangai
      with arms strong as mountains
      composed a garland of pāsurams with beautiful words
      on the Nambi, the god of Naraiyur
      surrounded with fields filled with pure water.
      If devotees learn and recite these pāsurams
      they will go to heaven and stay there happily forever.
