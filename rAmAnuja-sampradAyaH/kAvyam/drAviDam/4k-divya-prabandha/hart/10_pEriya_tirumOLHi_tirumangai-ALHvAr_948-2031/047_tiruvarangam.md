1408. Our dear lord who is the ancient four Vedas, the sacrifice,
      question, answer and the meaning of all,
      shining fire, abundant water, earth, cloud, wind,
      the seven roaring oceans, the seven mountains, the sky and the earth
      stays in Thiruvarangam.

1409. The dear lord with the countless good qualities
      of Indra, Nānmuhan and Shiva,
      our father, mother, children, relatives who will not abandon us,
      the remedy that removes our desires, the nature of all
      and the end and life for all creatures stays in Thiruvarangam.

1410. When the everlasting earth, the mountains,
      the oceans, the sky and the world of Danavas
      became dark without any light
      and the ancient four Vedas were stolen
      he took the form of a swan, brought them from the underworld
      and taught them to the gods and the sages.
      He gave them his grace and the darkness
      that covered their knowledge was removed.
      He our dear lord stays in divine Thiruvarangam.

1411. Using Mandara mountain as a churning stick
      and Vasuki the snake as a rope,
      when he churned the wave-filled milky ocean with his thousand arms,
      the sound of the churning rose to the sky roaring,
      the waves rose high and touched the sky
      and everything there, the moon, the sun
      and all the gods, saw it and were amazed.
      He stays in divine Thiruvarangam.

1412. How could the Asurans survive even if they wanted to?
      He took the form of a man-lion, went to Hiraṇyan
      and split open his shining chest ornamented with jewels
      making his hot blood splash everywhere
      like a waterfalls that drops from a golden hill and breaks the earth,
      and the lord was like a large silver mountain in the sky
      with shining teeth and cruel eyes that had woken up from its sleep.
      He our dear lord stays in divine Thiruvarangam.

1413. The lord who rests in the middle of the ocean rolling with waves
      on the thousand-headed Adisesha
      as the gods praise him with his thousand names
      fought with his strong axe and cut off the thousand arms of Vānāsuran
      who was as large as a thousand hills joined together.
      He our dear lord stays in divine Thiruvarangam.

1414. When the Rākshasa Rāvaṇa
      took his wife Seetha with curling hair and a mouth sweet as a fruit,
      Rama suffered and angrily decided to destroy Lanka
      and crush the diamond-studded crowns of Rāvaṇa.
      He dammed the water by shooting arrows at the wavy ocean
      and with the help of the monkeys he made a bridge with large stones.
      He our dear lord stays in divine Thiruvarangam.

1415. The god who is the eon, the lord of all the sacrifices
      and the lord of the sun that moves on a one-wheeled chariot,
      saved Gajendra when he was caught by a crocodile.
      He shot his mighty arrows and destroyed Lanka
      and he threw his discus and hid the sun during the day
      in the Bharatha war and gave his grace to strong Arjuna.
      He, our dear lord, stays in divine Thiruvarangam.

1416. The lord who drank the milk from the devil Putana and killed her,
      the dark-colored god who swallowed all the worlds and spit them out
      lay on a banyan leaf at the end of the eon.
      He can’t be reached by the gods in the sky who wear diamond crowns
      but he is close to me and removes all the troubles in my mind.
      He, the god of Thiruvarangam, was born as a cowherd child
      and carried Govardhana mountain to save the cows and the cowherds.

1417. Kaliyan with a heroic spear,
      the chief of Thirumangai filled with beautiful, everlasting palaces,
      composed ten Tamil songs on the god
      who stays in Thiruvarangam surrounded by the Kaviri river
      filled with swimming swans as it brings pearls,
      precious jewels and gold in its rolling waves.
      If devotees learn and sing these songs,their bad karma will disappear.
