958. The god of Thirumāvallam
     who bent his bow and killed the Rākshasas in Lanka
     stays in Thirupprithi in the Himalayas
     filled with fragrant groves, cool ponds and large springs
     where dark clouds climb the top of the tall hills
     filled with snow and roar with thunder
     and peacocks with beautiful wings dance.
     O heart! Let us go to Thirupprithi and worship him.

959. The lord who, as Rama, built a bridge
     with the help of the monkeys with large stones over the roaring ocean
     and went to magnificent Lanka and dashed it to pieces
     stays in Thirupprithi in the Himalayas
     where lions with sharp sword-like teeth living in caves
     wander out and attack strong angry elephants as large as mountains.
     O heart! Let us go to Thirupprithi and worship him.

960. Kaṇṇan, who wished to marry vine-like Nappinnai
     with a thin waist, curly hair and shining teeth,
     and killed seven angry bulls that bellowed like thunder
     stays in Thirupprithi in the Himalayas
     where male elephants sleep with their mates
     on beautiful beds of fragrant vengai flowers as bees sing.
     O heart, let us go to Thirupprithi and worship him.

961. The lord who took the form of an angry man-lion
     and split open the broad chest of Hiraṇyan
     as the gods saw him and worshiped him,
     bending down so their crowns touched his divine feet,
     stays in Thirupprithi in the Himalayas
     where boars split open the stones of the hills with their tusks
     and shining diamonds from the hills
     fall into the waterfalls and are carried down.
     O heart, let us go to Thirupprithi and worship him.

962. The lord who rests on the milky ocean
     with Lakshmi ornamented with a mekalai around her waist
     as the gods in the sky worship his sounding anklets
     stays in Thirupprithi in the Himalayas
     where bull elephants as large as mountains
     break young bamboo sticks, put them in honey
     and show their love as they feed them to their young mates.
     O heart, let us go to Thirupprithi and worship him.

963. The lord who rests on Ādisesha, the thousand-headed snake,
     as the gods in the sky worship him
     bowing their heads adorned with beautiful crowns
     and proclaiming, “You are the highest!”
     stays in Thirupprithi in the Himalayas
     where bees enter blooming groves and sing
     and fragrant mādhavi vines touch the sky,
     embracing the tall kurukkathi plants that support them.
     O heart, let us go to Thirupprithi and worship him.

964. He stays in Thirupprithi in the Himalayas
     where fighting tigers wander
     and vengai trees on the hills touch the clouds
     while pepper plants grow nearby
     and the gods in the sky come and bathe
     in beautiful blossom-filled springs,
     sprinkling eight kinds of flowers on his feet
     and worshiping him and reciting his thousand names.
     O heart, let us go to Thirupprithi and worship him.

965. The lord whom Nānmuhan and the gods in the sky worshipped, saying,
     “You are the ancient one of the world.
     You have the color of a cool dark cloud,”
     stays on a snowy mountain in the Himalayas
     filled with large blooming groves
     where snakes in dark caves sigh
     when they feel hungry in the dark night and go to look for prey.
     O heart, let us go to Thirupprithi and worship him.

966. The lord who gives his grace to his devotees
     protects them and removes their karma
     if they recite his thousand names
     and worship him in their minds-
     stays in the Himalayas where asoka trees bloom
     with fire-like flowers and the ignorant bees that see them
     are frightened because they think the grove is ablaze.
     O heart, let us go to Thirupprithi and worship him.

967. Kaliyan, the chief of Thirumangai
     surrounded with flourishing groves
     where bees with lined wings swarm, composed a musical garland
     of ten pāsurams on the god of Thirupprithi
     where huge snakes on the mountain
     hear the roaring sound of large dark clouds,
     think they are elephants and move away from their places.
     If good devotees learn and recite this garland of pāsurams with sweet music,
     the results of their bad karma will not come to them.
