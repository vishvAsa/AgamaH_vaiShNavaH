1962. She says,
      “The lord who carried Govardhana mountain as an umbrella
      and blocked the storm, saving the cows and the cowherds,
      and who danced the Kuravai dance with young girls in the mandram
      has enchanted me.
      The andril bird on the palm tree in the front yard coos and hurts me.
      Who can remove its nest so it will not coo and call its absent mate?”

1963. She says,
      “The heroic Kaṇṇan who shattered the blooming Kurundam trees,
      and broke the tusks of the elephant Kuvalayābeeḍam
      fought with the Asuran who came as a horse,
      took the form of a man-lion and killed Hiraṇyan,
      and drank milk from the devil Putana and killed her.
      When Kaṇṇan is with me what can the music
      of the bamboo flute of a cowherd do to my youth?”

1964. She says,
      “The dark sapphire-colored lord fought the wrestlers sent by Kamsan
      and conquered Kamsan and killed him.
      I think always of his cool thulasi garlands strung with alli flowers.
      The breeze comes and torments me in the evening
      and the bells of the strong bulls returning from the fields give me pain.”

1965. She says,
      “The faultless lord shot his arrows and destroyed the seven marā trees.
      Whenever I think of his divine feet,
      the sound of the cool dark ocean that roars all night
      and the cold wind that blows make me suffer. What can I do?”

1966. She says,
      “My mother scolds me.
      The calling of the andril bird makes me sick with love.
      The waves of the ocean roar and my bangles grow loose.
      These things have happened
      only since I fell in love with the beloved of Nappinnai
      whose waist is adorned with golden clothes and who walks softly like a swan
      with hair decorated with beautiful flowers.”

1967. She says,
      “The lord who carries a discus and a conch
      came to me in a dream and made me love him.
      Except me and my friend, the whole world is sleeping.
      The rooster has not crowed yet and it is very dark.”

1968. She says,
      “It is not fair that Kāma
      who is no relative of mine causes me pain,
      yet the ocean-colored god is my beloved
      and if Kāma is his son, he is also my son.
      He shoots the fire of love at me every night
      and my young breasts swell out
      loving the precious sapphire-colored lord.”

1969. She says,
      “The beloved god of Thirumalirunjolai
      where the clouds float high
      took my chastity and my heart and went away.
      He hasn’t thought of me at all after that.
      It is dawn yet?
      Where does the hot sun go and hide?
      Wouldn’t it be better if my suffering body could sleep?”

1970. She says,
      “O friend, Kāma shoots his arrows and makes us suffer.
      We shouldn’t think that we are just women and that we are weak.
      We should carry pure water and flowers and go where he stays.
      If we worship and praise him,
      won’t we be able to see the dark cloud-colored god with our eyes?”

1971. Kaliyan, the chief of Thirumangai praised by all,
      composed ten pāsurams on the victorious lord
      who fought and killed the seven heroic bulls.
      If devotees learn and recite these pāsurams
      they will not experience the results of their karma in this world.
