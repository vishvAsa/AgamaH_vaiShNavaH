1198. O little bee with dots on your body,
      you stay with your mate without leaving her
      and you enter pure open blossoms and drink their honey.
      Go and tell him who shot his strong arrows at his enemies
      and conquered them
      how I suffer in love for the lord of Thiruvāli
      where famous Vediyars live
      making sacrificial fires and reciting the Vedas.

1199. O small six-legged bee,
      you open lovely, fragrant neelam flowers
      and stay in them with your mate and drink honey from them.
      I do not know the thoughts of my beloved lord of Thiruvāli
      where beautiful kazuneer flowers bloom on the banks of fields.
      O bee, go and tell him how I suffer from the love for him.

1200. Neḍumāl adorned with fragrant thulasi garlands
      is water, sky, earth, fire and wind
      and he gives his grace to his good devotees.
      O small heron with a sharp beak,
      you live in the fields of Thiruvāli
      surrounded with flourishing groves.
      Go, find the right time and tell him of my love.

1201. Kāma, the king of love with a fish banner
      is shooting his powerful arrows at me
      and I suffer thinking of my lord who doesn’t think of me.
      O bee with lines on your body, who drink honey and live,
      go and tell the cowherd, the king of Thiruvāli,
      how I suffer from love for him.

1202. O bee, go and tell him this:
      “You are the king of the rich Kuḍandai.
      You measured the earth with your feet
      and carried Govardana mountain with your arms
      to save the cows and cowherds.
      I think of you all day and suffer
      as my sword-like eyes are filled with tear
      and my soft breasts grow pale with a soft golden color.”
      O bee, go and tell him to be my companion.

1203. O bee, my dear father
      whose mountain-like chest is adorned
      with a cool thulasi garland swarming with bees
      rode on his eagle and broke the tusks
      of the strong elephant Kuvalayabedam.
      Will he, the king of Thiruvāli
      where chariots run on the long streets,
      steal my bangles away?

1204. You, our good-natured lord
      who measured the earth and the sky,
      who are as strong as a mountain
      and rest on a snake bed on the sounding ocean with rolling waves
      are the king of Thiruvāli
      surrounded with flourishing groves where bees swarm.
      You have stolen my sleep.
      Are you thinking of stealing my gold bangles too?

1205. I bathe in the cool pond in Kuḍandai
      surrounded with flourishing groves
      where cuckoo birds sing,
      and I suffer thinking of you
      and cannot close my eyes to sleep.
      The young moon with a rabbit on it
      has made my bangles loose
      and now you steal the beautiful color of my body and make it pale.
      You are my beloved, O god of Vayalāli.

1206. You, the omnipresent lord, carry a victorious bow
      and stay in the Thirumeyyam hills.
      You, mighty one, destroyed the Asurans
      when they came as marudam trees.
      Even though you do not give me your grace to serve you,
      would you not embrace me one day?
      Until you come and love me,
      I cannot keep my bangles on my hands.

1207. Kaliyan, the fighter with a shining spear in his hands,
      composed ten Tamil pāsurams on Neḍumal,
      who bears a shining, oil-smeared discus and stays in Vayalāli
      where dark kohl-like kuvalai flowers bloom in the fields.
      If devotees learn and recite these ten pāsurams ,
      they will not experience the results of their bad karma.
