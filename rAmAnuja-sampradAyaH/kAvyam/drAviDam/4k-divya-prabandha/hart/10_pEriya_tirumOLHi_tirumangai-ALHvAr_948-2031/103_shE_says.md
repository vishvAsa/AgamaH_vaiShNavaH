      “He drove a shining chariot in the Bharatha war
      and he measured the world in three footsteps at Mahābali’s sacrifice.
      He fought with the Rākshasas and destroyed the pride of Lanka.
      See, my conch bangles have grown loose
      and I have lost my beauty because I love him.

1973. She says,
      “He stays in my heart.
      When the elephant Gajendra with huge legs was caught by a crocodile,
      he came and saved him and gave him his grace.
      I sing and dance, praising the names of broad-armed Neḍumal
      and my breasts do not grow slack or lose their bright color.
      What is this?”

1974. She says,
      “He saved all the four Vedas and taught them to the sages.
      He came to me, made my precious golden bangles loose,
      entered my heart and stayed there, without leaving.
      What is this? I don’t understand what he is thinking.

1975. The lord who was born as a little child and toddled
      stole fragrant ghee from the uṛi and ate it happily.
      He stays in beautiful Thirukkuḍanthai
      surrounded with fragrant groves.
      How could I say I don’t know him?

1976. If devotees bow to him and worship him every day
      he gives his grace to them
      and so we also bow and worship the lord
      and keep him in our mind as our refuge.

1977. Kaṇṇan measured the world with one foot
      and the sky with the other
      and his devotees keep his feet in their hearts.
      The gods in the sky worship him folding their lotus hands.

1978. Kaṇṇan is in my mind.
      Is it his māyam that makes the bangles on my arms grow loose?
      Is this because we are women and have the nature of women?
      We sing and praise the Thiruvenkaṭam hills of the lord and his Srirangam.

1979. O good heart, we want go join him.
      Let us dance and sing the praise of our dear lord.
      Let us think of the thousand-named god
      and let us wear his thulasi garland.

1980. O good heart!
      Let us fold our hands and worship him
      who stays happily in Thiruvāli
      where swans wander on the seashore
      so that our bad karma will go away,
      and let us wear flowers from the divine golden feet
      of the lord who has the color of a cloud.

1981. Kaliyan the poet composed ten Tamil musical pāsurams
      on the lord who has a thousand names.
      If devotees learn these names,
      they will rule all the three worlds.
      They who hear these pāsurams will live
      without any troubles in this world.
