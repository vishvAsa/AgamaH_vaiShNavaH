1508. The Nambi who shot arrows from his cruel bow
      and cut off the arms and heads of the Rākshasas in Lanka
      rules me and made me his devotee, ordering me to serve him.
      He stays in Thirunaṛaiyur where heroic men, handsome as Murugan and Kāma,
      and women with spear-like eyes walk on the streets
      and the noise of festivals does not stop all day.

1509. The Nambi with a thulasi garland on his chest
      who took the form of Balaraman, carried a sharp mazhu weapon
      and killed many crowned kings over many ages stays in Thirunaṛaiyur
      where mullai flowers dripping with dew bloom like the teeth of women
      and dark kuvaḷai blossoms bloom like their eyes,
      and the lovely lotuses bloom like their faces.

1510. Our lord Nambi who rests
      on the shining snake Adisesha on the clear milky ocean
      shot his arrow and killed Marisan
      when the Raksasan came in the form of a swiftly running deer
      and went to king Mahabali as a dwarf, asked for three feet of land,
      and measured the world and the sky with his two feet.
      He stays in Thirunaṛaiyur where in the groves filled with birds,
      kāvi flowers bloom like the eyes of beautiful women
      and lotuses bloom like their faces.

1511. When our Nambi ate the butter that Yashoda hid
      she was angry and tied him with a strong rope to a mortar
      and he sobbed, crying and crying.
      He stays in Thirunaṛaiyur
      where a cool breeze moistens the mullai flowers,
      bees are intoxicated as they drink honey
      and the opening jasmine flowers smile like lovely women.

1512. Our lord who went to northern Madura,
      joined the festival of the bow competition,
      fought with the wrestlers there and defeated them,
      and who jumped into the pond and danced on the heads of Kālingan
      stays in Thirunaṛaiyur where many good Vediyars
      recite the divine Vedas well and perform Soma sacrifices.

1513. Our Nambi fought with the heroic Vāṇāsuran
      and cut off his thousand strong arms
      when Murugan, the husband of Valli,
      Shiva, the three-eyed god, and the other warriors
      came to help Vānāsuran in battle,
      lost the war fighting with him
      and, ashamed, retreated from the battlefield.
      Our lord stays in Thirunaṛaiyur
      surrounded with fields where a female crab
      looks at the face and large mouth of a male crab, caught in a lotus plant
      and starts a love fight with him.

1514. The lord with a sharp discus
      who drove the chariot for Arjuna and destroyed the kings
      when they came to fight with spears in the Bharatha war
      and as the king of the cowherds carried Govardhana mountain as an umbrella
      to protect the cows and cowherds from the storm
      stays in Thirunaṛaiyur
      where Vediyars recite the four Vedas,
      perform the five sacrifices, recite the six Upanishads
      and sing the seven kinds of music.

1515. When Panjali who plays ball with her hands
      had promised that she would tie her hair up
      until the Kauravas lost the Bharatha war,
      Kaṇṇan went to fight, blew the conch on the battlefield,
      terrified the ankleted Kauravas
      as they rode on elephants and defeated them.
      Our Nambi stays in Thirunaṛaiyur
      where Vediyars with hands that never stop giving,
      are as great as Nānmuhan on his beautiful lotus
      and the mighty Shiva.

1516. Shiva the bull rider,
      with his matted hair adorned with the crescent moon
      and the flowing Ganges,
      wearing a snake as his ornament and a kondrai garland,
      his body smeared with vibhuti ??
      went to our god and asked him to remove the curse
      that Nānmuhan had given him.
      Nambi, the god of Thirunaṛaiyur -
      surrounded with fragrant beautiful groves,
      took blood from his mountain-like chest,
      poured it into Nānmuhan’s skull
      that was stuck to Shiva’s hand and made it fall.

1517. Kaliyan the chief of Thirumangai
      surrounded with fields and strong walls
      composed a garland of Tamil pāsurams
      praising Nambi, the lord of Thirunaṛaiyur
      where good Vediyars recite the Vedas.
      If devotees sing these pāsurams and worship the lord,
      they will not experience the results of their karma.
      They will rule this world, go to heaven and be worshiped by the gods.
