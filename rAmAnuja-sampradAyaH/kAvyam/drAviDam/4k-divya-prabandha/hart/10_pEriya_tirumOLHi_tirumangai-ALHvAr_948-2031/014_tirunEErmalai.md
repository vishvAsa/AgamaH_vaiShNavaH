1078. Our lord who stays with Lakshmi
      and the cowherd’s daughter Nappinnai, loving them,
      stands in Thirunaṛaiyur surrounded with flourishing water and thick groves,
      sits in Thiruvāli, reclines in Thirukkuḍantai
      and dances in Thirukkovalnahar flourishing with ponds.
      He does not show any compassion to the Rākshasas
      and stays in Thiruneermalai hills.

1079. The lord grew angry at Indra
      and burned Kāṇḍavanam when Indra stayed there.
      He fought in the Bharatha war and saved the world from affliction,
      and when he became angry with Hiraṇyan,
      he took the form of a man-lion and split open the Asuran’s chest.
      The lord who went to Mahabali’s sacrifice as a dwarf, grew tall
      and measured the earth and the sky with his feet
      stays in the famous hills of Thiruneermalai.

1080. Our god, the ruler of the world carries a curving conch
      and a mighty discus that destroys his enemies
      fought in the Bharatha war with the Kauravas,
      throwing his shining discus and hiding the sun,
      the god of the day, and causing the Pandavas to win the war,
      taking away the suffering of Draupadi
      ornamented with beautiful jewels.
      He stays in the beautiful Thiruneermalai hills.

1081. Our lord took the form of a man-lion and killed Hiraṇyan
      making all his wives enter the fire,
      and joined the Pandavas, protecting them in the Bharatha war,
      destroying the hundred Kauravas,
      and fulfilling the challenge of Draupadi.
      He stays in the large Thiruneermalai hills.

1082. The dark cloud-colored lord
      built a bridge on the roaring ocean
      to go to Lanka with beautiful forts over which moon floats
      and fought with the army of the Rākshasas,terrifying them, destroying Lanka,
      and cutting off the ten heads with shining crowns of Rāvaṇa
      with the sword that was given to him by Nānmuhan.
      He stays in the wonderful Thiruneermalai hills.

1083. Neḍumal, the ocean-colored god,
      who swallowed the world, the high snow-filled mountains,
      the oceans, the sun and the moon and still felt hungry
      and quarreled with Parasuraman, the matchless sage,
      the king of a huge land surrounded with oceans
      stays in the large Thiruneermalai hills and rests on Adisesha on the ocean.

1084. When the Rākshasa Hiraṇyan, conquerer of all with his sword,
      did not listen to his son Prahladan
      and refused to recite the thousand names of the god,
      the lord who was the equal of the Asuran Hiraṇyan in battle
      took the form of a heroic man-lion,
      fought with Hiraṇyan and split open his chest.
      He stays in the large Thiruneermalai hills.

1085. The Jains carry peacock feathers
      and like people who eat corpses
      they wander shamelessly and fearlessly.
      The devotees of the lord
      who hate the Jains come to our god's temple every day,
      sprinkle beautiful flowers with love on his feet
      and pray with their hearts melting, saying,
      “Protect us from Yama and give us your grace.”
      He stays in the beautiful Thiruneermalai hills
      and gives his grace to his devotees.

1086. If you worship the god of Thiruneermalai
      whose fame surpasses words,
      even before Yama’s messengers know what your karma is,
      that hill will destroy your karma and protect you.
      He stays in those flourishing hills
      where lovely bees swarm around fragrant flowers in flourishing groves
      and where evil people caught in the pleasures
      of the five senses and mind cannot reach him.

1087. Kaliyan, the famous chief of Thirumangai
      who fights with strong elephants in battle,
      composed ten Tamil pāsurams on the god of Thiruneermalai.
      If devotees worship him and pray to him to remove their karma,
      it will be removed and they will rule the shining world
      surrounded with large oceans under a royal umbrella and reach heaven.
