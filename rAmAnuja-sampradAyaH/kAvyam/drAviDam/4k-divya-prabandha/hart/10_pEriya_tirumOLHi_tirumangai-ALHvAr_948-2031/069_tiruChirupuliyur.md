1628. O devotees!
      Think of removing evil thoughts from your mind
      and worship the ankleted feet of the lord
      who stays in your heart and in the temple Salasayanam in Chiṛupuliyur
      where the clear waves of the ocean
      bring shining jewels and spread them on the beaches.
      Think of him.

1629. Do not listen to the preaching of the Jains
      who vow to wander on the streets and beg for rice and porridge.
      Come and worship the feet of the god, the dwarf
      who stays in the temple in Salasayanam in Chiṛupuliyur
      where renowned Vediyars recite the Vedas
      and worship his feet.

1630. O devotees,
      worship the lord and he will remove your bad karma.
      I think of nothing even for moment except the feet of the god
      of Salasayanam temple in Chiṛupuliyur surrounded with water, fields,
      and groves where winged bees swarm.

1631. Thirumāl, the lord of Indra the king of gods,
      who keeps with him the axe-carrying Shiva
      with the moon that floats in the sky in his matted hair -
      stays in the temple Salasayanam in Chiṛupuliyur
      surrounded with groves dripping with honey.
      I do not know anything but the feet of him, the cowherd.

1632. The place where the gods in the sky come to pray and say,
      “Our father, give us your grace so we will not reach cruel hell”
      is the temple of Salasayanam in Chiṛupuliyur
      where lovely lotuses bloom in rolling waters.
      O lord with lovely lotus feet, give me, your slave, your grace.

1633. He stays in the temple Salasayanam
      in Chiṛupuliyur surrounded with flourishing fields
      where dark neelam, ambal and lotus flowers
      bloom with kazhyneer flowers
      like the beautiful eyes, mouths and faces of lovely women.
      If devotees worship the god
      and bow to his divine feet they will not know trouble.

1634. O Māyan, you stay in the cool Thirumalirunjolai hills
      that rise to the sky.
      Tell me, are you in the four Vedas?
      Are you in the temple Salasayanam in Chiṛupuliyur
      where Vediyars make fire for their sacrifices?
      Are you in the hearts of your devotees?
      I do not know.

1635. O lord, you are pure.
      You rest on five-headed Adishesha on the ocean
      and in the temple Salasayanam in Chiṛupuliyur
      where parrots repeat the words
      that beautiful girls teach them.
      I want to control my mind that dwells on women
      with lined kohl-darkened eyes
      that are like lovely neelam blossoms
      and so I come to worship your ankleted feet
      to escape my desire.

1636. You have the color of a lovely dark cloud,
      the form of fire, of cool water, of a large mountain
      and of all other things,
      and you have your own form that no one else has.
      You, sweet as the nectar in the milky ocean,
      stay in the temple Salasayanam in Chiṛupuliyur
      embracing Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth.
      Your feet are my refuge.

1637. Kaliyan the chief of Thirumangai
      surrounded with flourishing fields
      composed a Tamil garland of pāsurams with music,
      praising the dark cloud-colored god of the gods
      of the Salasayanam temple in Chirupuliyur
      that has long beautiful streets.
      If devotees recite these pāsurams and worship the lord
      the results of their karma will be removed.
