1418. You did not consider that the boatman Guhan
      was poor and low-caste, or that he was not your relative,
      but gave your sweet grace to him
      and even told him that your wife, the innocent doe-eyed Sita,
      was his sister-in-law and that your brother Lakshmaṇa was his brother.
      You told him happily, “You are my friend. Stay here with me.”
      I heard those words and they stay in my mind.
      O you with the color of the dark ocean,
      I have come to you and worship your feet. You are my refuge,
      god of Thiruvarangam surrounded by beautiful groves.

1419. You did not think Hanuman, the son of Vāyu,
      was born as a mere animal. You did not ignore him
      because he belonged to the clan of monkeys
      but you happily accepted him as a friend,
      and your kindness was immeasurable, larger than the ocean.
      You told him lovingly,
      “There is nothing that I can return for all the things
      that you have done for me. I will eat with you.”
      Thinking that you would show the same kindness
      you showed to Hanuman to me, your faithful servant,
      I have come to you to worship your feet.
      You are the god of Thiruvarangam surrounded with beautiful groves.

1420. When Gajendra the elephant worshipped you
      with a lotus flower that bloomed in a lovely pond
      in a grove full of fragrant flowers
      and a strong crocodile caught his feet,
      he thought of you as his refuge and called to you in pain.
      Enraged at the cruel crocodile with its evil mouth, you destroyed it.
      I understand that you can become angry even to that extent
      to save your devotees.
      I have come to you as my refuge and worship you
      O god of Thiruvarangam surrounded by beautiful groves.

1421. When an eagle with beautiful wings,
      terrified of an angry poisonous snake,
      came to you and asked for refuge, you felt pity in your heart,
      gave your grace and saved it—I have heard about your kindness.
      Afraid that the cruel messengers of Yama,
      speaking unkind words, will come to me and do cruel things,
      I, your slave, have come to you and worship your feet
      to be saved from them,
      O god of Thiruvarangam surrounded with beautiful groves.

1422. A Brahmin skilled in the Vedas
      saw that the gods in the sky and the people of the earth
      could come, worship your soft flower-like feet
      and receive what they wanted.
      Even though he wanted to reach you
      he was unable to forget the passion he had for women
      as beautiful as peacocks. You said to him,
      “Stay on the earth, enjoy worldly pleasures and then come to me.”
      I want the golden grace that you gave to that Brahmin.
      I have come to you and you are my refuge,
      O god of Thiruvarangam surrounded with beautiful groves.

1423. When Markaṇḍeyan, the son of a sage
      and scholar of all the four Vedas, was terrified of cruel Yama
      and came to you asking for refuge
      you grew angry at ruthless Yama, took his power away
      and gave your wonderful grace to young Markaṇḍeyan,
      granting him a place beneath your divine feet
      so he never would be separated from you.
      I heard about that and thought that if I worship you
      you will give me your divine grace and keep me under your feet.
      I have come to you, my god.
      I am your slave and you are my refuge,
      O god of Thiruvarangam surrounded by beautiful groves.

1424. A faultless Brahmin Sandipani who taught the Vedas to all
      and put the sacred thread on you lost his own son.
      When he worshiped you and cried,
      “I lost my dear son. Find him and bring him to me,”
      you found his son and gave him to the Brahmin.
      I heard about that and have come to you to worship your feet.
      You are my refuge,
      O god of Thiruvarangam surrounded by beautiful groves.

1425. A Brahmin who always recited the Vedas
      came to you and worshiped you, asking,
      “O my father, as soon as my wife gave birth to children they disappeared—
      a cruel god took them away. You are my refuge.
      Give me your grace and save us.”
      People mocked him because he was childless,
      but you gave your sweet grace
      in front of those who mocked him
      and gave all his children back to him.
      I heard of the wonderful grace you showed him
      and have come to you to worship your divine feet.
      You are my refuge,
      O god of Thiruvarangam surrounded by beautiful groves.

1426. Lovingly you gave your sweet grace
      to the heroic king of the Thondai country with a shining crown,
      staying with him for seven nāzhigais and teaching him a precious mantra.
      I heard about that and have come to you to worship your golden feet
      that measured the world and the sky.
      You are my refuge and I am saved,
      O god of Thiruvarangam surrounded by beautiful groves.

1427. Kaliyan, the conquerer of many enemies,
      the king of Thirumangai surrounded by palaces,
      composed ten pāsurams on the god of Thiruvarangam
      surrounded by beautiful groves.
      O devotees, worship the famous, ancient god, our father, Neḍumal with a discus.
      If you learn and recite these ten pāsurams, your sins will go away.
