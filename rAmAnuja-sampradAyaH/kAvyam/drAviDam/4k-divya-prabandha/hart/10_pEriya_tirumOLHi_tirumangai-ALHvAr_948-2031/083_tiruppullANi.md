1768. She says,
      “O heart, you suffer with your love \ for him.
      How can I control it?
      Is it because of my bad karma?
      In the cool shadows of the cherundi grove
      blooming with golden flowers he loved me
      and then left me taking my beauty with him.
      He is the god of Thiruppullāni
      where the punnai trees shed pearl-like flowers in the groves.
      O heart, let us go there and worship him.”

1769. She says,
      “O heart! You melt with love.
      What is the use of staying here thinking of him?
      Once, one day, he loved me under the shadow of blooming thazhai plants
      where singing bees drink honey from the flowers,
      and left me there
      and since then my love for him has grown in my heart.
      He is the god of Thiruppullāni where the waves dash on the banks
      of the river and leave jewels.
      O heart, come let us go and worship him.”

1770. She says,
      “I am innocent. What can I do to forget him?
      Come, get up and let us worship him.
      He followed me into the grove
      dripping with pollen and filled with ponds
      and promised me he wouldn’t leave me, but he did.
      He is the god of Thiruppullāni
      where the fragrance of flowers spreads all day.
      O heart, come, let us go there and worship him.”

1771. She says,
      “O friend, you are beautiful among women!
      Carrying a Garuda flag he came to me, loved me
      and promised that he would not leave me
      but he didn’t keep his promise.
      The only witness there was the bee that drinks honey.
      He stays in Thiruppullāṇi where the rising waves of the ocean
      dash on the banks of the river and leave jewels behind.
      Come, let us go and worship him there.”

1772. She says,
      “When I think of what happened to me my heart burns.
      Surely I have done bad karma.
      He decorated my hair with bunches of flagrant nyāzhal flowers,
      and loved me, but then he left me and I suffer.
      He is the god of Thirupullāni where the waves of the ocean leave conches
      and jewels on the shores. Come, let us go there and worship him.”

1773. She says,
      “O heart, what is the use of worrying and staying here thinking of Māyan,
      our generous, sapphire-colored lord and his love?
      He is the god of Thiruppullāṇi surrounded with birds
      and fields with wet sand where kāvi flowers drip honey
      and thāzhai flowers with beautiful leaves bloom,
      opening their lovely petals. Come, let us go there and worship him. .”

1774. She says,
      “O pitiful heart, what is the use of staying here
      thinking of his love, unable to sleep night and day?
      He stays In Thiruppullaṇi
      where the white waves come jumping like horses,
      bringing pearls and leaving them on the abundant white sand.
      O heart, let us go and worship him.”

1775. She says,
      “He with a conch and a discus
      loved me and left me, leaving me to suffer.
      He cheated me and I shouldn’t love him.
      He is the god ofThirupullani, filled with salt pans and streams of water
      where happy bees sing in the cool flourishing groves
      and their music spreads on the banks of the ocean that smell with fish.
      Come, let us go and worship him there.”

1776. She says,
      “O dear friend, let us fold our hands and praise his names,
      placing beautiful bright flowers on his feet and worshiping him.
      Whether he gives anything in return or not,
      loving and worshiping him is what we should do.
      Let us love him—that is enough.
      Come, let us go to Thiruppullāṇi and worship him.”

1777. Kaliyan, the poet of faultless fame,
      composed a garland of pāsurams
      on beautiful Thirupullaṇi surrounded with groves
      filled with lovely lotus flowers
      and flourishing with corals and shining pearls.
      If devotees learn and sing these pāsurams
      and circle the temple of the god,
      they will go to Vaikuṇṭam.
