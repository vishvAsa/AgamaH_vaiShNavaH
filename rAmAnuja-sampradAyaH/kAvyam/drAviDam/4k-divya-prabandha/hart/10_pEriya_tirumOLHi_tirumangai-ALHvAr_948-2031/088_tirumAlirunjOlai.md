1818. O ignorant heart,
      I would tell you something wonderful.
      If you would be rid of the infatuation you feel
      for beautiful fragrant-haired women,
      go to Thirumalirunjolai where waterfalls descend from the sloping hill
      bringing sandalwood, precious jewels and beautiful peacock feathers
      where our divine lord of all the seven worlds and seven oceans stays in his temple.
      Come, let us go there and worship him.

1819. Thirumālirunjolai is the temple where the gods worship,
      telling all in the sky, “Come and let us go and worship the lord,”
      carrying garlands and pure water and going to praise our lord
      adorned with shining crowns and resting on a snake bed.
      There bees drink sweet honey
      from the fragrant kuṛinji flowers blooming in the forests
      and bamboo plants growing on the sloping hills
      split apart and throw out pearls.
      O ignorant heart, come, let us go there and worship him.

1820. Our dear lord who removes the sickness of his devotees
      if they worship him and who gives his grace to all
      went to Mahabali as a small, handsome dwarf
      and measured the whole world with his two feet.
      He stays in the temple of Thirumālirunjolai
      where hunters shoot their arrows on the slopes
      and precious stones grow and vengai trees flourish.
      O ignorant heart, come let us go there and worship him.

1821. The lord who drank milk from the breasts of Putanā,
      and shot fearful arrows at the evil Thādagai and killed her
      stays in the temple in Thirumālirunjolai
      surrounded with cool flowing water
      where sweet honey from fragrant kuṛinji flowers
      drips on the blossoms of vengai trees over which clouds float.
      O ignorant heart, come let us go there and worship him.

1822. Our dear god who fought and destroyed
      the pride of his enemy, the Rakshasa Rāvaṇa,
      making his ten heads fall to the ground
      while his headless body stood there and danced
      stays in the temple in Thirumālirunjolai
      where the tops of the bamboo plants split open bee hives
      and the bees fly away and much honey spills out
      making the slope of the whole hill fragrant.
      O ignorant heart, come let us go there and worship him.

1823. Our divine lord who rests on the snake bed of Adisesha
      killed the two Asurans, throwing one who had come as a calf
      at the other who came as a vilam tree,
      and he carried a pot and danced the kuravai dance.
      He stays in the temple in Thirumālirunjolai
      where a lion is angry and roars
      thinking that the sound of the thunder of the clouds
      that rise to the sky carrying water from the sea is the trumpeting of an elephant.
      O ignorant heart, come, let us go there and worship him.

1824. The dark ocean-colored one
      who threw ripe palm fruits at the Asuran Thenugasuran and killed him
      stays in the temple in Thirumālirunjolai
      filled with flourishing emerald-colored groves where deer walk on stony paths
      and graze on the grass on the slopes.
      O ignorant heart, come let us go there and worship him.

1825. Our cloud-colored lord who rests on the bed of the snake Adisesha
      on the roaring ocean where waves rise up to the sky
      stays in the temple of Thirumālirunjolai
      where happy bees drink the ichor
      dripping from the cheeks of angry elephants
      and flowing on the slope of the hill.
      O ignorant heart, come let us go there and worship him.

1826. He, our highest lord, our father,
      who loves even the ignorant Jains and Buddhists
      and others of other religions
      that put their own beliefs ahead of the Vedas
      stays in the temple in Thirumālirunjolai
      where women in the shadows of a grove
      of long-branched sandal trees on the slopes
      recite mantras and worship our god.
      O ignorant heart, come let us go there and worship him.

1827. Kaliyan with a long shining spear,
      the chief of Thirumangai in Thiruvāli country
      surrounded with good fences of thazai flowers,
      composed pāsurams on the beautiful sapphire-colored god
      describing how his devotees praise and worship him
      in Thirumālirunjolai where bees sing on the slopes.
      If devotees learn and recite these ten pāsurams
      they will rule this world surrounded by the sounding oceans.
