1838. Our dear god, our king, chief of the gods in the sky,
      who stays in the minds of the devotees who praise him
      and gives them his grace, stays in Thirukkoṭṭiyur
      where a cool, tall waterfall makes a cloud of golden drops
      and lovely lotuses bloom and shine.

1839. He, our king is the sweet lord of beautiful Lakshmi
      and the beloved of the sweetly-smiling earth goddess
      with a coral mouth whom he embraces.
      He cures all painful diseases of his devotees
      and he stays in divine Thirukkoṭṭiyur
      where the breeze blows
      and spreads the fragrance of jasmine and mauval flowers everywhere.

1840. The faultless sapphire-colored lord,
      the god of gods in the sky, the light of our lives,
      who swallowed all the seven worlds and spit them out
      stays in Thirukkoṭṭur surrounded with fields
      where the abundant wave-filled water of the rivers
      flows carrying sandalwood and samarai stones
      making the fields flourish.

1841. He, the beloved of Lakshmi,
      the goddess who nurtures good families,
      gave a part of himself to Shiva
      who carries a sharp shining axe and rides a bull,
      stays in Thirukkoṭṭiyur where lovely young bees
      embrace the fragrant jasmine and shanbaga flowers
      and drink good sweet-smelling honey.

1842. The ocean-colored Neḍumāl,
      the king of the gods in the sky, beautiful as a precious sapphire,
      whose crown is adorned with long flower garlands dripping with honey,
      who measured the world at Mahabali’s sacrifice-
      stays in Thirukkoṭṭiyur
      where the moon floats in the sky above the white flags
      flying above the beautiful jewel-studded palaces touching the clouds.

1843. The dear god, my ruler,
      who shot his arrows at the king of Lanka,
      destroyed his valor and defeated him
      stays in Thirukkoṭṭiyur
      where all the rulers of the world
      and the gods come to worship him
      knowing that it is there that he stays.

1844. Our god, the beloved of the earth goddess,
      threw a vilam fruit at a calf and killed the two Asurans
      when they came as a tree and a calf
      and easily carried Govardana mountain as an umbrella to protect the cows
      and the cowherds from a terrible storm.
      He stays in Thirukkoṭṭiyur
      where the fresh breeze mixes with the fragrance
      of cool jasmine flowers and mullai flowers
      as it comes from the hills.

1845. The god of the gods who broke the kurundu trees
      when the Asurans came in the form of those trees,
      killed the elephant Kuvalayābeeḍam
      and destroyed the Asuran Kesi when he came as a horse
      made me his devotee and slave and entered my heart.
      He stays in Thirukkoṭṭiyur surrounded with cool water and groves
      where sweet jackfruits rest on the ground,
      bunches of bananas ripen on their branches
      and mangoes grow on their trees.

1846. The Vediyars in Thirukkottiyur who wear shining threads
      and are as divine as Nānmuhan seated on a beautiful lotus
      sing Tamil pāsurams and dance the kuḍakkuthu dance.
      Scholars of the four Vedas and six Upanishads
      and performers of the five kinds of fire sacrifice,
      they all worship the god of gods in Thirukkoṭṭiyur.

1847. The poet Kaliyan,
      the mighty chief of Thirumangai who rides a horse,
      composed a garland of sweet Tamil pāsurams
      on the dark cloud-colored god of Thirukkoṭṭiyur
      surrounded with beautiful groves and fields where fish frolic.
      If devotees learn and recite these ten sweet Tamil songs
      and praise Neḍumāl, they will go to heaven.
