1788. She says,
      “The white crescent moon,
      the rolling waves of the ocean,
      the breeze that blows with the fragrance of flowers,
      the calling of the andril birds all bring me the pain of love.
      I cannot sleep at night when dew falls.
      He has taken over all my five senses
      but doesn’t feel pity for me.
      I am just a girl soft as a creeper.
      Take me to Thirukkuṛungudi
      where he with the dark color of a kuvalai flower stays
      and leave me there.”

1789. She says,
      “The cool wind that blows from the jasmine flowers dripping with pollen
      and the cool crescent moon together take my life.
      I cannot sleep even for one night.
      If the ignorant women adorned with bangles on their hands are able to sleep,
      let them gossip about me as they wish.
      On his chest, the lord of Thirukkuṛnguḍi embraces Lakshmi
      whose hair is adorned with fragrant flowers. .
      Take me there and leave me.”

1790. She says,
      “The morning brings me the pain of love just like the evening,
      and the night only makes it greater, lasting as long as an eon.
      If I try to describe the cold wind
      I can only say it hurts me like a rising fire.
      There are many tricks that the beautiful sapphire-colored Thirumāl can do.
      Before he does something and hurts me,
      take me to Thirukkuṛunguḍi
      filled with forests where beautiful peacocks dance.”

1791. She says,
      “The sound of the bells on the dark necks of the bulls
      that wander with their white cows hurts my heart
      and I cannot sleep even one night.
      The generous lord stays in Thirukkuṛunguḍi
      where the fields flourish with water
      and the gods adorned with precious jewels praise his wonderful grace.
      Take me where he is.”

1792. She says, “In the evening I hear the bells on the necks of the bulls
      and the sweet music of the flute of the cowherds.
      The breeze blows and the crescent moon shines.
      They were always harmless before
      but now they all join together and hurt me.
      I have done bad karma.
      Take me and leave me in Thirukuṛunguḍi
      where the lustrous cloud-colored lord stays.”

1793. She says,
      “Girls ornamented with beautiful jewels
      gossip about me night and day.
      Let them do what they want. I am not worried.
      They are good people—I don’t know what is wrong with them.
      I am not shy, naive or afraid.
      They may make themselves happy saying things about me,
      but I won’t forget the sapphire-colored lord.
      Take me and leave me in Thirukkuṛunguḍi
      where soft mullai blossoms bloom luxuriantly
      in the backyards of the houses.”

1794. She says,
      “A tall dark god with beautiful eyes entered here.
      He made my body weak and my bangles loose.
      I wonder, ‘Why is this happening to me?’
      The tricks of Kāma who carries a bow
      with five flower arrows make me suffer from love.
      I didn’t understand that.
      Take me and leave me in Thirukkuṛunguḍi
      surrounded with forests and cool fields
      blooming with flowers that drip honey.”

1795. She says,
      “Listen, it is not only the sound of the ocean that hurts me,
      or the hands that are like ambal flowers
      of the cowherd that come and pain my life.
      Kāma may come and shoot his five flower arrows at me.
      Before that happens,
      find out what the dancer, the cowherd, thinks
      and take me and leave me in Thirukkuṛunguḍi.”

1796. She says,
      “Even though I praised him and worshiped him, he doesn’t take pity on me.
      He took my chastity, gave me golden clothes to cover myself
      and left, I don’t know where.
      My breasts have grown out but they are no use
      because he doesn’t embrace me.
      He, a dancer and king of the gods,
      wishes to stay in Thirukuṛunguḍi.
      Take me there and leave me where he is.”

1797. She says,
      “The god of the gods who keeps the goddess Lakshmi with him,
      the generous lord who destroyed southern Lanka,
      entered the heart and the eyes of famous Kaliyan
      who composed pāsurams that praise the victorious god,
      ruler of the whole world.
      Take me to Thirukkuṛunguḍi where he stays and leave me.”
