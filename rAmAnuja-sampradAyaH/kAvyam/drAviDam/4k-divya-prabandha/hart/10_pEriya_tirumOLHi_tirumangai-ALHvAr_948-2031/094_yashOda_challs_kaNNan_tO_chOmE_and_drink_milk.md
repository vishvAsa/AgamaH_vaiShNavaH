+++

1878. Run and come happily as fragrant flowers
      fall from your beautiful hair
      and put your mouth on my breasts,
      hold them and drink milk.
      O Nambi, son of Nandan,
      you are my nectar and I enjoy you.
      You are my father and my lord. Come and drink my sweet milk.

1879. O Nambi, colored like the ocean with rolling waves
      and like a dark cloud,
      you are tall and precious, with lovely eyes,
      and your mouth is red like a beautiful lotus.
      Milk is coming from my breasts.
      I called you loudly but I have not seen you.
      Where are you? Are you playing with the cowherd children?

1880. O Nambi, as you play happily on the street
      with the rich, handsome cowherd children
      my heart melts seeing your naughty play
      and milk spills from my breasts onto the ground.
      Come embrace me, sit on my lap and drink milk.

1881. When people look at you
      they think that you are the result of the tapas
      that all women have ever done.
      You, the first one of the world,are strong as a rutting elephant.
      I will catch the crescent moon in the red evening sky
      and give it in your hands.
      O dear one, come and sit on my lap
      and drink milk happily.

1882. My son with hair dark as kohl,
      you walked between the marudu trees and destroyed the Asuras.
      O clever one, you steal and swallow butter.
      Do not be in a hurry.
      The milk from my breasts doesn’t want to wait.
      O good one who measured the world,
      come and drink my milk, come and drink my milk.

1883. You are not a good child
      if you do what other naughty children do.
      You speak more cleverly than others
      and like a thief you do many naughty deeds
      making my heart melt as I see you.
      Milk is spilling from my breasts.
      Don’t pretend you are sleepy.
      Come and drink milk.

1884. When Putana, the devil woman, came as a mother
      and fed you the milk from her breasts,
      O Nambi, you drank her poisonous milk and killed her.
      You are the beloved of earth goddess
      and of beautiful Nappinnai, daughter of a cowherd.
      My son, drink milk. Come and eat your food.

1885. If I hit you with the stick I’m holding,
      your relatives will be angry with me.
      I am worried but I won’t hurt you.
      When the cows return home,
      the gods in the sky will see them.
      Don’t stand in the street in the evening,
      O lord with a discus in your hands.
      Come to me and eat your food.

1886. You, great as an elephant,
      the son of the generous Nandan,
      the chief of the cowherds,
      are a prince among your relatives,
      famous from ancient times.
      You graze the cows every day in the forest.
      Why haven’t you come to eat food before this?

1887. Kaliyan, the poet with handsome heroic arms
      composed ten divine pāsurams on the lovely-eyed Neḍumal.
      If devotees learn and recite these ten pāsurams
      that describe how Yashoda called Kaṇṇan to come and eat
      and if they worship the true god,
      they will go to heaven and be with the gods.
