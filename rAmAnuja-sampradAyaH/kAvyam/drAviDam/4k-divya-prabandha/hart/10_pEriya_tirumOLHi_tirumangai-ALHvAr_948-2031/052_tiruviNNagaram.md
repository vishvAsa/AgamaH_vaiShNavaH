1458. Before I wanted wealth
      and the pleasures that the five senses gave.
      Even though I was hurt again and again,
      I did not stop enjoying those pleasures.
      I was friendly with people I liked
      and I hated those I did not like.
      Now, I have come to understand
      that those pleasures were evil
      and I have removed them from my mind.
      O lord of Thiruviṇṇagar,
      now I hate the deeds I did and I come to you, my refuge.

1459. You, the highest, embrace Lakshmi on your chest.
      I forgot you in all my births
      and until now never thought of you in my heart.
      I was born to be in the depths of sorrow
      again and again and I am weak,
      but I have become your good devotee.
      O god of Thiruvinnagar,
      I come to your feet—you are my refuge.

1460. You are the sky, the earth, and honey.
      You came to me, entered my heart and remained there.
      I stayed in the womb of doe-eyed women
      and I stayed in this body made of flesh
      and I realized that births and this body
      will not give me heaven.
      O god of Thiruvinnagar,
      I come to you—you are my refuge.

1461. I left my wife and children
      realizing that they cannot help me attain moksha.
      Through your grace I threw away pleasures
      to rid myself of the troubles that my five senses gave
      that shine like swords.
      I come to you and worship your feet.
      O god of Thiruvinnagar, I am your slave. You are my refuge.

1462. We hear how many kings who ruled the world
      and were praised with “pallaṇḍu” by women
      with beautiful hair swarming with honey-drinking bees
      have all passed from this earth.
      I do not want the impermanent life of this world
      and I come to you and worship your feet.
      O god of Thiruvinnagar,
      I am your slave. You are my refuge.

1463. I do not want to do the things
      that my five unknowing senses want.
      You, a fighter, battled with the strong wrestlers
      and the Asurans and defeated them
      and you shot your arrows and destroyed Lanka
      surrounded by wide oceans and strong forts.
      I come to you and worship your feet,
      O god of Thiruviṇṇagar. I am your slave. You are my refuge.

1464. You are my father.
      Don’t be angry with me
      if I ask you for something different
      than what others want in this world.
      You created the five senses,
      but they will put me, your slave, in cruel hell.
      I don’t trust them
      and they will not help me reach your feet.
      I don’t know what to do.
      I come to you and worship your feet,O god of Thiruviṇṇagar.
      I am your slave. You are my refuge.

1465. My bad acts, like fires, stayed with me
      pretending they were good friends.
      They came hurrying to me
      and thought that they could put me in a cruel hell
      where no one wants to go.
      You are the divine lord of the everlasting gods
      who released the moon from its curse.
      I come to you and worship your feet,
      O god of Thiruviṇṇagar. I am your slave. You are my refuge.

1466. You, the king who embraces Lakshmi
      are worshiped by the gods in the sky.
      You went as a messenger to help the Pandavas
      to the unfriendly Kauravas with their scepters and royal umbrellas
      and you spoke pure and true words to them.
      You the lamp that brightens my mind,
      taught the Vedas to the sages.
      I come to you and worship your feet,
      O god of Thiruviṇṇagar.
      I am your slave. You are my refuge.

1467. Kaliyan with a spear smeared with flesh,
      the chief of Thirumangai
      surrounded with flourishing fields and walls that touch the sky,
      composed a garland of ten Tamil poems
      praising the god of Thiruviṇṇagar,
      surrounded with groves blooming with flowers that drip with honey.
      If devotees learn and recite these pāsurams well,
      they will become kings on this earth
      and go to the world of the victorious gods.
