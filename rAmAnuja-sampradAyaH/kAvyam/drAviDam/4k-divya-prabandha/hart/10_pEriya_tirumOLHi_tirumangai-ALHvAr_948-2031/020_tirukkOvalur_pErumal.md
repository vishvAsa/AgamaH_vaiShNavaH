1138. The dear lord swallowed all the mountains where clouds float,
      the seven oceans, the sky, the earth and all things,
      kept them all in his stomach
      and lay on a tender banyan leaf at the end of the eon.
      I saw him in Thirukkovalur
      where fine paddy grows shining in the fields
      and where pure reciters of the Vedas
      perform Soma sacrifices on the southern banks of the Peṇṇai river
      that flourishes with abundant water.

1139. He rests on Adisesha on the ocean,
      as the gods in the sky bring fragrant thulasi garlands,
      sandal paste, fragrances and lamps to worship him
      and both Lakshmi whose breasts are smeared with sandal paste
      and the earth goddess rub his feet.
      I saw him in rich Thirukkovalur
      where the reciters of the Vedas make the five sacrifices
      and three fires and worship him reciting
      the six Upanishads and the four Vedas
      with musical songs that have seven ragas.
      They think only of him in their minds night and day.

1140. When the pious elephant Gajendra
      was caught by a terrible crocodile
      with sharp sword-like teeth in the pool in a grove
      where tender shoots and blossoms bloomed,
      he was terrified and called the lord,
      and our god with his discus came to the pond,
      killed the crocodile, saved Gajendra and gave him his grace.
      I saw our lord in Thirukkovalur
      where dark neelam blossoms bloom,
      large punnai buds open with the color of red gold
      and lotuses in the beautiful ponds shine like fires.

1141. The lord, sweet nectar for his devotees
      who shed tears of devotion for him,
      rode on Garuḍa, fought with the Māli, strong in battle,
      conquered and destroyed the Rakshasas
      and released the people of the earth from their troubles.
      I saw him in Thirukkovalur surrounded with groves
      where kongu trees, budding surapunnai trees and kuravam trees grow
      and the sweet sugarcane plants in the fields
      listen to the singing of swarms of lined bees and sleep.

1142. Our god who fought and killed with one arrow the Rākshasas
      Karan, Kavandan, Māli and the monkey king Vāli
      who carried spears smeared with blood,
      destroying the army of Rākshasas
      with teeth shining like crescent moons
      and their king Ravaṇan in Lanka,
      stays in famous Thirukkovalur where devotees recite
      pāsurams on all the porches of shining palaces
      where a breeze blows from groves
      surrounded with ponds. I saw him there.

1143. When the cowherd mother Yashoda tied up Kaṇṇan
      because he stole fragrant butter from the uri and ate it,
      he cried and his wide eyes were filled with tears
      and he looked like an elephant tied to a stake.
      I saw him staying with Lakshmi
      and the eight-armed earth goddess
      in Thirukkovalur filled with rich palaces
      studded with shining diamonds.

1144. The lord grew angry at the elephant Kuvalayābeedam and killed it,
      fought with the Rākshasa Kesi when he came as a horse,
      conquered the seven bulls to marry Nappinnai,
      killed the wrestlers when they came as marudam trees,
      killed Sakaṭāsuran when he came as a cart
      and fought and killed his enemy, the evil Kamsan.
      I saw him in Thirukkovalur surrounded with groves
      where the buds of cherundi flowers bloom and drip honey
      and kamugu trees ripen with dark fruits
      and pālai trees spill white pearls
      as their dried beans shine like emeralds
      and their ripe fruits glow like corals.

1145. The lord who went as a messenger to Duryodhana for the Pandavas,
      drove a large chariot for Arjuna in the battle
      and conquered and killed all the Kauravas
      stays in flourishing Thirukkovalur
      where good Vediyars, skilled in the Vedas,
      gather together and praise the god, and Shiva, rider of the bull,
      Kubera, the king of Alahai, Indra, the king of the gods,
      and four-headed Nānmuhan come together and worship him.

1146. The lord who has beautiful hands, legs, a divine mouth and eyes,
      carries a shining discus and a conch in his hands
      and stays with the beautiful earth goddess and Lakshmi,
      is like the Kaṛpaga tree in Indra’s garden
      and gives his grace to the gods and all others.
      His godly form is adorned with red clothes and ornamented with pure gold.
      I saw him in everlasting Thirukkovalur
      where Vediyar live, divine like Nānmuhan
      and like Shiva who is colored fire red.

1147. Kaliyan the king of Thirumangai,
      with a shining sword and the beloved of his queens,
      composed pāsurams on the cloud-colored Thirumāl,
      bright as a blue emerald,
      who saved Gajendra from his suffering.
      I saw him in rich Thirukkovalur
      filled with good, renowned Vediyars, proficient in the Vedas.
      If devotees learn and recite these ten pāsurams
      and praise him they will rule this world
      and will be able to see the omnipresent one.
