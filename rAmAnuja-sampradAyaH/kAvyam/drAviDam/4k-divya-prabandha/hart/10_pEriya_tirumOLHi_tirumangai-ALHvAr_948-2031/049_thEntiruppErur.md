1428. The dark colored lord
      who carries a shining discus and a conch in his hands,
      is not false but a true god
      and if you approach him he will accept you as his devotee.
      I have praised the names of him who rests on Adisesha, the snake bed in Thenthirupperur
      surrounded by thick groves where beautiful lotuses bloom
      and I am saved.

1429. I have praised the names of Thirumāl,
      our father who swallowed the seven oceans,
      the mountains, the sky and all the beautiful worlds and spat them out,
      the god of Thenthirupperur surrounded with thick groves
      that touch the dark clouds and the moon and I am saved.


1430. He created Nānmuhan on a lotus on his navel,
      removed the curse of Shiva with blood from his body
      and told both of those gods to rule the world of the gods.
      I praise the names of the dark mountain-like lord
      who rests on Adisesha in Thenthirupperur surrounded by walls
      and I am saved.

1431. When Shiva, carrying the skull of Nānmuhan
      and wandering all over the world,
      asked the gods of sky to remove his curse,
      Thirumāl gave Shiva the precious blood from his body
      and made Nānmuhan’s skull fall.
      I have praised the names of the chief of gods in the sky
      who stays in Thenthiurpperur surrounded with flourishing fields
      and groves dripping with honey and I am saved.

1432. When Hiraṇyan was afflicting the gods in the sky
      the gods went to Thirumāl and said to him,
      “You, the Māyan who split open the mouth of the Asuran Vakkaran,
      give us your grace and protect us,”
      and the lord took the form of a laughing lion,
      went to Hiranyan and split open his chest with his claws.
      I have approached the feet
      of the precious god of Thenthirupperur who holds a discus
      and I am saved.

1433. He built a bridge with stones to go to Lanka,
      shot arrows from his bow,
      cut off the twenty arms of Ravaṇa the king of Lanka
      and brought back his wife Sita ornamented with shining jewels.
      I went to Thenthirupperur
      where, when the Vediyar loudly recite the four Vedas,
      malanku fish in the fields hear them and jump in fright,
      and worshiped the lord and I am saved.

1434. When he stole butter, Yashoda the cowherdess
      was angry with him, hit him with her churning stick
      and tied him up with a small rope, but he kept quiet.
      Every day I praise the names of the ocean-colored god
      of Thenthirupperur surrounded with large strong walls and I am saved.

1435. The lord was born in a cowherd village and raised there,
      and killed seven bulls to marry Nappinnai, as beautiful as a vine,
      as the gods in the beautiful golden world of the sky saw
      and praised him.
      Every day I praise the names of our god of Thenthirupperur
      surrounded with precious walls shining like gold and I am saved.

1436. I worship in my mind always the Vediyars of Thenthiruperur,
      who have done much tapas
      and are more skilled than the gods in the sky from the ancient times,
      in all the four Vedas, the five sacrifices and the six Upanishads.
      They live with lovely-eyed Thirumāl in the temple
      in Thirupperur surrounded with fields where fish frolic.

1437. Kaliyan with strong heroic arms,
      the king of Thirumangai where flags fly on the walls,
      composed a garland of pāsurams with beautiful words
      praising Thirumāl resting on Adisesha on the snake bed
      in Thirupperur surrounded with groves that swarm with bees.
      If devotees sing these pāsurams and dance,
      they will go to the high sky.
