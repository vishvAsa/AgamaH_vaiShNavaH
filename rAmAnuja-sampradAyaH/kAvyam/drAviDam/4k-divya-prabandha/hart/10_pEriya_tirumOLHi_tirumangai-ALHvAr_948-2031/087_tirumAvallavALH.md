1808. O heart, if you are suffering with your family,
      your father, mother, children and others,
      and if you feel you should not be burdened with them,
      go to famous Thiruvallavazh
      where the young lord, the cowherd
      who is the beginning, the end, the ancient of the ancients stays,
      worship and praise him
      and love him in your mind.

1809. O heart,
      if you are afraid and disgusted with the life
      you lead loving women whose thin waists
      are more beautiful than lightning
      and who walk gently like swans,
      go to Thiruvallavāzh, the famous place of the god,
      and embrace him, the messenger for the Pandavas
      adorned with crowns studded with precious diamonds.

1810. O heart,
      if you think it is wrong to believe the lies
      that statue-like women with ornamented breasts tell lovingly
      and if you want to survive,
      go to famous Thiruvallavāzh, the place of the lord ,
      who, carrying a white umbrella as bright as the moon,
      went as a dwarf and begged for three feet of land
      at the sacrifice of Mahabali.

1811. O heart, if you want to survive
      and get away from the thought that you want to embrace
      the round breasts of statue-like women
      with words as soft as music,
      then go to Thiruvallavāzh where the god of gods in the sky,
      the rich ocean-colored lord of the Thiruvenkaṭam hills, stays
      and worship him.

1812. O, heart, you know that the kings
      with white umbrellas that touched the clouds,
      rulers surrounded by many elephants,
      have suffered and passed from this world.
      If you do not want to suffer like they did,
      go to Thiruvallavazh where the god stays
      who drank milk from Putanā’s breasts and killed her,
      praise and worship him.

1813. O heart, are you afraid that the pleasures of the five senses
      will enter your body made of nerves, skin and flesh
      and give you terrible diseases?
      Go to Thiruvallavāzh
      where Vediyars recite the four Vedas and the six Upanishads
      and make the five fire sacrifices.

1814. O heart, do you think it is a mistake
      to listen to the words of evil people
      who believe in the reality of the body that suffers with diseases?
      Go to Thiruvallavazh, the beautiful place
      where Māyanar stays who is the sky, moon, hot sun, fire and wind
      and worship him.

1815. O heart, do you realize that the body
      made of sky where clouds float,
      and of fire, water, earth and air
      is not a fortress and that it will not save you?
      Go to Thiruvallavazh and worship the lord
      who stays with statue-like Lakshmi seated on a lotus,
      her soft breasts smeared with sandal paste.

1816. O heart, if you do not think that it is your duty
      to follow the false teachings of the Pasupathars,
      the Jains and the Buddhists
      and if you do not think they will save you,
      go to Thiruvallavazh where sages worship
      the generous god who gave nectar
      from the milky ocean to all the gods.

1817. Kaliyan, the chief of flourishing Thiruvāli,
      who fights his enemies valiantly with his blood-smeared spear,
      composed ten pāsurams on the faultless god
      of Thiruvallavazh where many Vediyars live reciting the Vedas,
      surrounded with groves swarming with lovely-winged bees.
      If devotees learn and recite these pāsurams
      they will become kings, ruling and enjoying this wide world.
