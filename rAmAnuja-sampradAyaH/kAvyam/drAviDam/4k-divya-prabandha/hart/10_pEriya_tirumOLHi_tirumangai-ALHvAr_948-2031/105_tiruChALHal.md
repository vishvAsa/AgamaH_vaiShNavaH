1992. O friend, see, he went on a path filled with stones
      and lived in the forest with his wife Vaidehi with soft doe like eyes..
      The gods from the sky bowed with their heads
      adorned with garlands and worshiped
      the golden feet of Rama when he walked in the forest. Say sāzhale.

1993. O friend, see!
      After he was born he released his father Vasudeva
      from the chains that bound his ankles
      and Nandan, the cowherd chief, took him as a baby to his village
      where he was raised as Nandan’s son.
      He is our dear lord, the father of Nānmuhan, sāzhale.

1994. O friend, see!
      He was raised as a cowherd among people
      who did not know he was the lord.
      He ate happily all the fragrant butter
      that the long-haired cowherd women of the village churned and kept.
      His golden stomach that swallowed all the seven worlds
      surrounded by the deep ocean
      had still more room to eat the butter from the uri. Sāzhale.

1995. O friend, see!
      He was raised as a cowherd among the innocent cowherds of the village
      and ate and relished the fragrant butter that was kept in the uri,
      but his stomach was still not full and he swallowed all the worlds
      surrounded by the oceans with rolling waves. Sāzhale.

1996. O friend, see! The beautiful dark-haired cowherd women
      hit him with a churning stick and tied him up with a small rope,
      but though he was tied up,
      even the gods of the sky could not know who he is. Sāzhale.

1997. O friend, see!
      He danced the marakkāl kuuthu in the mandram as the drums beat
      and his devotees saw his enthusiastic dance.
      Yet though he danced the marakkāl kuuthu in the mandram,
      he is hard for the gods to know. Sāzhale.

1998. O friend, see!
      When the Kauravas disgraced Draupadi, the Pandavas’ wife,
      he went as a messenger to the Kauravas
      and asked them to give land to the Pandavas,
      but Duriyodhana disgraced him in the assembly.
      Yet even though he was disgraced in that way,
      he swallowed all the worlds surrounded by the sounding ocean
      and spat them out. Sāzhale.

1999. O friends, see.
      He drove the chariot of the Pandavas in the terrible Bharatha war
      and destroyed their enemies, the Kauravas.
      Yet even though he drove the chariot for the Pandavas
      all kings, adorned with garlands, worship him bowing their heads. Sāzhale.

2000. O friend, see!
      He went to the sacrifice of Mahābali,
      the king adorned with cool garlands,
      and begged for three feet of land,
      making those who saw him feel pity.
      Yet even though he begged for those three feet of land,
      he is the highest lord of the seven worlds. Sāzhale!

2001. O friend, see!
      He went as a dwarf to king Mahabali’s sacrifice,
      asked for three feet of land, tricked the king, grew tall
      and measured the world and the sky with his two feet.
      Even though he is the god of Thiruveḷḷam and Thiruvenkaṭam,
      he is in the heart of the poet Kaliyan. Sāzhale.
