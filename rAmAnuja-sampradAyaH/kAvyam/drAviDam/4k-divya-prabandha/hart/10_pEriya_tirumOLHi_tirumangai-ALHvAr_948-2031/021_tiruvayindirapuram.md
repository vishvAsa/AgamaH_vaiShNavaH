1148. The god who rests on the dark ocean
      on Adisesha took the form of a boar
      went to the underworld and brought up
      the cool earth goddess on his curving tusk, embracing her.
      He stays in everlasting Thiruvayindirapuram
      where bees drink honey from lotus flowers,
      sing sweet music and go to fresh cherundi flowers,
      embracing them and flying around in the beautiful grove.

1149. The highest lord, the meaning of the four Vedas,
      who carries a shining discus in his hand
      and embraces beautiful Lakshmi on his chest
      stays in Thiruvayindirapuram
      where madhavi vines grow on the mountain slopes
      and female bees fly around blooming lotus buds
      swarming and singing with the sound “tena tena.”

1150. Māyavan, the divine lord, always true to his devotees,
      who swallowed all the seven worlds
      and lay on a banyan leaf as a baby
      stays in shining Thiruvayindipuram
      where on the slopes of the hills
      madhavi vines embrace senbaga plants,
      mullai creepers dance in the wind,
      red lotuses bloom and palm trees flourish.

1151. Our god who split open the chest
      of his enemy the strong Asuran Hiranyan
      and gave his divine grace to his son Prahladan,
      stays in famous Thiruvayindipuram
      where flourishing cool wet fields have abundant water and mud
      and the soft juicy sugarcane plants growing there
      give cool shade and touch the sky.

1152. Our lord who went to the sacrifice of Mahabali,
      asked for three feet of land
      and measured the wide earth and the sky with his feet,
      and fought seven bulls to marry Nappinnai,
      the lovely vine-like daughter of a cowherd
      stays in Thiruvayindipuram
      where monkeys searching for food,
      jump from one branch to an another on vengai, kongu and shenbaga trees blooming with golden flowers
      and eat sweet jack fruits that taste as if they were mixed with honey.

1153. The dark cloud-colored lord
      who went to the forest as Rama with his young vine-like wife Sita
      because his stepmother Kaikeyi
      listened to her maid, the hunch-backed Manthara,
      and asked Rama to go to the forest
      stays in Thiruvayindrapuram
      surrounded with large walls and high mountains
      over which the moon floats
      as the flourishing groves drip with honey.

1154. Our lord who, as Rama, fought and destroyed
      the ten crowns of the king of Lanka
      to bring back his beautiful vine-like Sita
      with a waist as thin as lightning
      stays in cool Thiruvayindipuram
      where a male swan with his mate
      sits sweetly on a lovely bed of lotuses
      under the shadow of a shining mountain
      and the fine paddy plants fan them.

1155. Our lord who, as Rama, broke the bow
      to marry Sita with soft, fragrant dark hair,
      and carried Govardhana mountain
      as an umbrella to stop the terrible storm
      and save the frightened cows and the cowherds
      stays in Thiruvayindipuram
      where the flourishing river with its rolling waves
      brings the ivory of rutting elephants from the high mountains
      along with the fragrance of akil plants
      and deposits them all in the paddy fields.

1156. Our father who drove the chariot for Arjuna
      in the cruel Bharatha war and killed the Kauravas
      with strong spears in their hands
      stays in Thiruvayaindipuram
      where on the cool slopes of the hills
      betel leaves grow abundantly
      and the young kamugu trees with branches
      spread their fragrance
      while fish frolic in the flourishing rivers that flow to the fields.

1157. Kaliyan who carries a strong spear
      composed ten beautiful Tamil pāsurams
      praising the god of the gods in Thivayindipuram
      where the gods of the sky
      and the Asurans go to worship him.
      He measured the earth and the sky
      with his two feet at Mahabali's sacrifice.
      If devotees sing these ten beautiful Tamil pāsurams,
      the results of their bad karma will disappear.
