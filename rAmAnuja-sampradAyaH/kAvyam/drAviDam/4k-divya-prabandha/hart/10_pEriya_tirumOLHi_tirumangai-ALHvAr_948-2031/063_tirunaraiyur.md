1568. The learned ones praise him in their minds always saying,
      “He killed the cruel-eyed Rakshasas with his heroic bow.”
      The Nambi who destroyed the seven trees cannot be seen by anyone,
      but I, his slave, I saw him in a dream and I am very happy.

1569. He, adorned with emeralds on his ears,
      makes me think of him
      like a calf that thinks of his mother,
      and he thinks of me and gives his grace to me. .
      He, the lion of the gods in the sky
      and a cowherd in a village surrounded with walls,
      swallowed the world and spat it out.
      I will not praise anyone except my dear god, my friend.

1570. Not entering any other heart,
      he came to me and entered the heart of me, his slave.
      I have caught him tightly
      and he will not let me go to Yama’s messengers.
      The lord, the dancer who dances on a pot,
      is the king of Kuḍandai surrounded with groves
      where bunches of flowers bloom.
      He is my father, my father’s father, and my mother.
      He is my dear lord—how could I forget him?

1571. The lord drove Arjuna’s chariot in the Bharatha war
      and killed the strong Kaurava kings,
      giving his grace to the Pandavas,
      and went to Lanka surrounded by the ocean and destroyed it.
      He is the god of Srirangam on the bank of Kaviri
      where bees swarm around the abundant water
      and he, the lord of the sky, he rules me.
      My mind will not be devoted to anyone
      except the beautiful lotus-eyed Kaṇṇan,
      the ruler of all the worlds.

1572. The lotus-eyed lord, precious like gold,
      saying “Do not be afraid,” will come and help me
      when I, his slave, am plunged into cruel hell.
      He, the jewel of the gods in the sky
      and the lion of Thiruvenkaṭam,
      killed the Asuran when he came as a horse.
      When Yashoda tied him to a mortar when he stole butter,
      he was sweet as sugarcane.
      He is like honey and good milk
      and my mind will not think of anyone except him

1573. My famous lord will not leave my mind even for a moment.
      Sweet as sugar and sugarcane juice,
      he stays in Thirumalirunjolai surrounded with groves
      where kongu trees bloom with abundant golden flowers.
      He taught lovingly the four Vedas to the sages
      and rests on Adisesha on the milky ocean.
      I will not compose pāsurams on anyone
      except the dear Nambi of Thirunaṛaiyur.

1574. He is like pālai, the best of all the ragas, played on a yāz.
      He, the god of the gods in the sky,
      entered me and abides in my eyes, heart and mouth,
      and he stays in the minds of the Vediyar learned in the Vedas.
      He shining like a precious jewel,
      is colored like the ocean, high with water, where fish frolic.
      My mouth will not praise anything except the nature of my lord.

1575. Tell me, how can results of any karma come to me
      now that I have received the grace of the lord in this birth itself?
      He is the creator and the ancient path for all
      and he removes the sorrows and troubles of all,
      giving them only joy.
      He, a sage praised by the whole world,
      is worshiped by the gods in the sky,
      and he is moksha and a fruit enjoyed by his devotees
      and a thief who has robbed me of my heart.
      I found him today.

1576. Tell me, for I am his slave,
      what can I give back to him for everything he has done for me?
      The famous lord, the ruler of Thanjai,
      who split open the chest of Hiraṇyan,
      and who built a bridge on the ocean, went to Lanka
      the land of the king Ravaṇa,
      with a shining sword like lightning and destroyed it -
      stays in my heart.
      He is a large golden mountain and a diamond hill
      and my mind will not praise anyone except him

1577. Kaliyan, a poet and chief of Thirumangai of Thiruvāli surrounded with groves
      blooming with flourishing flowers that swarm with bees,
      put his head on the divine flower-like feet of Nambi and worshiped him.
      He danced and composed ten Tamil pāsurams
      for the devotees of the lord.
      O devotees, sing these ten songs
      and the results of your karma will go away.
