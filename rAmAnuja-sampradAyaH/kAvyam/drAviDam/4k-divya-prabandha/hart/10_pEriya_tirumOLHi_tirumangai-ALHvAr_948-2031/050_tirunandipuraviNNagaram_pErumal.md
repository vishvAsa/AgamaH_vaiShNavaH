1438. Our lord is the faultless earth, fire, wind, water, and the high sky,
      our faultless mind, sleep and moksha.
      When he stole butter
      and his mother Yashoda became angry and hit him,
      he was not worried.
      O heart! Think of going to Nandipuraṇṇagaram
      where our good lord with a broad chest stays.

1439. O heart, there is a way you can be saved—
      this is what you must do.
      Think of Nandipuraviṇṇagaram
      where the lord stays who swallowed the seven worlds at the end of the eon,
      where dark lined bees drink honey, play in the flowers with their swarm
      and sing Naivaḷam ragas in the groves.

1440. The broad-chested god who filled his stomach,
      swallowing all the seven worlds, the world of the gods,
      the seven oceans and the seven mountains
      and kept them in his stomach and spat them out
      stays in Nandipuraviṇṇagaram
      surrounded with flourishing fields and groves
      where golden-colored bees drink honey from the fresh flowers.
      O heart, think of that place where our friend stays
      and go there.

1441. When the Asurans with shining teeth like crescent moons
      came to fight with the lord and said, “We will oppose him with our might,”-
      our Neḍumāl fought with them.
      He made their stomachs burn and their bodies fall to pieces,
      defeating them so they ran away with empty hands.
      He stays in Nandipuraviṇṇagaram
      with groves where peacocks dance, cuckoos call,
      flowers bloom, bees sing, tall mango trees spread their fragrance
      and clouds float in the sky.
      O heart, think of going to that place where he is.

1442. When the Asurans thought,
      “We will fight with our enemies and burn all their places,”
      our god who carries a sword, a bow, a discus,
      a club, and a conch in his beautiful hands
      shot his arrows swiftly and cut off their arms and legs.
      O heart, think of Nandipuraviṇṇagaram where he stays always.

1443. The lord who as Rama went to the hot forest
      with his beloved wife and his brother Lakshmaṇa
      stays happily in Nandipuraviṇṇagaram
      where cuckoo birds sing from the branches
      and peacocks dance in the beautiful groves.
      O heart, think of that place and worship him.

1444. Our lord Kaṇṇan was carried by Vasudevan
      as a baby in the dark night to a cowherd village
      and raised by strong Nandan, the chief of the cowherds.
      He was praised by the gods saying, "He is our father"

as they sprinkled fragrant flowers and worshiped him.
He stays in Nandipuraviṇṇagaram surrounded with groves
where peacocks hear the sound of drums and dance
thinking it is the roaring of clouds in the rainy season.
O heart, think of that place where he is
and where the king Nandi served him.

1445. In Nandipuraviṇṇagaram the divine sages
      come and worship him, sing beautiful songs and dance saying,
      “No matter how much we search, we find no god better than ours.”
      The gods from the sky also come there, sprinkle flowers on him
      and say “There is no land as beautiful as this on earth.”
      O heart, think of that place where he is.

1446. If devotees obey his commands
      they become like boats that never overturn even in a flood
      when the ocean water is so high they are raised to the sky.
      In Nandipuraviṇṇagaram the rivers flourish with water
      and bring jewels that sparkle with brightness and take away the darkness.
      O heart, think of that place where he is.

1447. Kaliyan, the poet with a strong shining spear smeared with blood,
      composed ten pāsurams on the god
      who carries in his lovely hands a curved conch and a discus
      and wishes to stay in Nandipuraviṇṇagaram
      where clouds float over the groves that drip with honey.
      If devotees learn them properly and recite them,
      all their bad karma will disappear.
