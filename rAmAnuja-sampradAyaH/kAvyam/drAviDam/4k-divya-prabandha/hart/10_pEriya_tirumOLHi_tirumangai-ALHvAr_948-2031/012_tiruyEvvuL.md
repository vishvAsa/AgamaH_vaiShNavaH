1058. When the Rākshasa king of Lanka came as a sage
      in orange clothes and took Sita the wife of Rama to Lanka,
      our Nambi went to Lanka, fought with its king, destroyed it
      and brought his wife Sita back.
      The beautiful cowherd women
      with round bamboo-like arms scolded him saying,
      “You stole our butter and ate it. You are a thief.”
      He rests on a snake bed on the ocean in Thiruyevvuḷ.

1059. When the Rākshasa king loved Rama's beautiful wife Sita
      and took her to Lanka, our father, our dear lord
      went to Lanka, shot his arrows,
      and fought a cruel war with their king Ravana,
      making his faultless ten heads
      crowned with golden crowns fall to the earth.
      He rests on his snake bed on the ocean in Thiruyevvuḷ.

1060. When Rama sent Hanuman to Lanka as a messenger
      and Rāvaṇa did not send Sita back,
      he became enraged at the Raksaksas
      and went to Lanka and destroyed it with his arrows.
      He went to Duryodhana for the Pandavas
      and so he is praised by the world as the messenger of Pandavas.
      He rests on his snake bed on the ocean in Thiruyevvuḷ.

1061. Our Nambi, our father,
      who was raised as a son by the famous Nandan
      and fought with seven strong bulls,
      defeating them to marry Nappinnai
      who plays with a ball with her soft fingers
      rests on his snake bed on the ocean in Thiruyevvuḷ.

1062. The lotus-eyed Kaṇṇan,
      who swallowed all the seven worlds
      at the end of the eon and lay as a baby
      on a banyan leaf for many ages,
      rests on his snake bed on the ocean in Thiruyevvuḷ
      where bees with blue wings drink honey
      from neytal flowers and live on cool fields
      surrounded with fragrant groves.

1063. The lord whom devotees and sages
      joined together and praised saying,
      “O Nambi, we worship you.
      You are our ancient one. You have beautiful eyes.
      You are the three-eyed Shiva himself!”
      rests on the snake bed on the ocean in Thiruyevvuḷ.

1064. Our father, creator of Nānmuhan on the lotus on his navel,
      is the moon, water, sky, fire and wind,
      and is praised by the Sama Veda.
      The lord who keeps in his body Shiva
      who has matted hair where the Ganges flows
      and wears kondrai garlands swarming with bees
      rests on a snake bed on the ocean in Thiruyevvuḷ.

1065. The highest matchless king of the gods
      is all the three gods, pure, virtuous, a sage,
      unique, remote and colored like a kāyām flower.
      The lord who is sweet to all his devotees and taught the Vedas to the sages
      rests on the snake bed on the ocean in Thiruyevvuḷ.

1066. The dark-colored god, shining like a diamond,
      who embraces on his chest the beautiful Lakshmi
      who has soft fingers and plays with a ball
      is the god of the gods in the sky
      and the king of the gods Indra.
      He rests on the snake bed on the ocean in Thiruyevvuḷ.

1067. Kaliyan the king of Thirumangai
      surrounded with flourishing fields swarming with bees
      composed a garland of ten beautiful Tamil pāsurams
      on the god who rests on the ocean
      and is worshiped in Thiruyevvuḷ by devotees who carry flowers garlands.
      If devotees learn and recite these pāsurams, they will rule this earth
      and they will go to the world of the gods and rule there.
      This is a promise.
