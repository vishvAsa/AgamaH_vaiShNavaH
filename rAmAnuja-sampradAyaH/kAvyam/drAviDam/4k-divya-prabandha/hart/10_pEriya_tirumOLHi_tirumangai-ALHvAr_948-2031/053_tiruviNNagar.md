+++

1468. I will not lose the divine pleasures
      that I receive from you.
      I will not forget your beautiful form ever.
      I do not want to be born in this world again
      and because of your grace, I will not be born again,
      O god of Thiruviṇṇagar, all I have is because of your grace.

1469. I do not love or hate anyone.
      I left my family and all other relatives
      and friends and became a good person.
      I, your slave, worship your feet, O Thirumāl.
      You the god of Thiruviṇṇagar are dharma itself.
      I received you in my heart and I will not let you leave it.

1470. I am afraid and tremble
      when I see beautiful women
      with soft glances like does, lovely faces like the moon
      and sharp eyes like arrows that can hurt anyone.
      I was frightened, ran and came to you,
      O lord, handsome god of Thirukkuṛungudi.
      You are the honey of Thirunaṛaiyur
      and you stay in Thiruviṇṇagar surrounded with abundant water.

1471. I was plunged into a flood of joy,
      as I embraced the beautiful arms of women
      with soft breasts smeared with sandal paste.
      But now I fell into the sorrow of hell for the rest of my life.
      You are virtuous and compassionate
      and since I approached you all my bad karma is gone,
      O god of Thiruviṇṇagar.

1472. You are the highest and victorious lord
      and I do not think of any god but you.
      I will not be born again
      because I have the fortune of keeping you in my mind
      who destroyed Rāvaṇa the king of Lanka
      surrounded by the ocean that never dries,
      O god of Thiruviṇṇagar.

1473. You are the ocean, dark as kohl,
      the earth, the beautiful mountains,
      the bright sun and the moon.
      I know that you are in my heart and you will save me.
      Truly I will not think of any other gods from now on,
      O god of Thiruvinnagar.

1474. People can say whatever they like,
      but I, your slave, will tell what I know—
      please keep this in your mind.
      I will not think of any other gods but you
      and I will not praise them,
      O god of Thiruvinnagar.

1475. There are many who fall like trees
      in terrible burning deserts knocked over by wild elephants.
      I don’t want to think of myself as one of them
      and plunge into sorrow.
      When can I think only of you?
      When will I reach the world in the sky,
      O god of Thiruviṇṇagar?

1476. O lord with Lakshmi on your chest,
      I am your slave and have done service for you.
      O Nambi, give me your grace
      so my bad karma does not afflict me.
      Tell me, my lord. You. a wrestler, danced on a pot
      and killed the Asuran Madhu.
      Your fame will never disappear from this world,
      O god of Thiruviṇṇagar.

1477. Kaliyan, the poet, as generous as a rain-giving cloud,
      composed a garland of ten Tamil pāsurams on the god of Thiruviṇṇagar
      surrounded by flourishing groves
      and ponds blooming with lotuses.
      If devotees learn and recite these pāsurams
      no troubles will come to them in their lives.
