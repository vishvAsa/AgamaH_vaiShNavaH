1218. The gods come from the sky and worship the lord saying,
      “You are everlasting light. No one can measure your power.
      You are Narayaṇan who took the form of a man-lion
      and split open the chest of Hiraṇyan.
      O father whose body has the color of a dark cloud, give us your grace.”
      He is god of Manimāḍakkoyil in Thirunāngur
      filled with groves where happy bees swarm everywhere singing the kandāram rāgam
      and pārijādam trees grow thick, giving shade and spreading fragrance.
      O my heart, go to worship him in the temple in Nāngur where he stays.

1219. Our father who took away the suffering
      of the trembling elephant Gajendra
      when a crocodile in a deep pond caught him
      stays in Maṇimādakkoyil in Thirunāngur
      filled with shining palaces and pillars that touch the sky,
      where the male doves with beautiful coral-like legs
      love their gentle mates with soft fledglings.
      O heart, worship him in that temple.

1220. The lord who saved the mountain-like elephant Gajendra,
      killing the crocodile that had caught him and wounded him on the head,
      stays in Thirumaṇimaḍakkovil in Thirunāngur
      where the waves of the Ponni river
      carry the tusks of elephants attacked by lions, fragrant akil,
      beautiful pearls and white sāmarais
      and leave them all on the banks.
      O heart, let us go to that temple and worship him
      where he stays holding Lakshmi on a lotus that drips honey.

1221. Our lord who went to Lanka surrounded with oceans
      riding on large-winged Garuḍa
      and fought and destroyed the Rākshasas
      who carried long spears smeared with blood,
      making them run away on all sides
      stays in Maṇimāḍakkoyil
      where Vediyars worship him in his famous temple,
      perform the five sacrifices, make the three fires,
      recite the six Upanishads and know the seven kinds of music.
      O heart, let us go to Nangur and worship him.

1222. Our lord drank poisonous milk from the breasts of Putanā
      and killed her,
      threw Vatsāsuran when he came as a calf onto Kapithasuran
      who had the form of a Vilām fruit tree, killing them both,
      broke the Kurundam tree and made its tender leaves wither,
      and entered the lotus pond and danced on the head of Kālingan.
      He stays in Maṇimaḍakkoyil in Nāngur
      where the tender shoots of the trees and the blooming creepers embrace each other,
      cuckoo birds coo and peacocks dance as the clouds float over the groves.
      O heart, let us go to Nāngur and worship him.

1223. Our lord who did not feel sorry for Putanā
      when he drank the milk from her breasts and killed her
      while the cowherd women
      whose words are sweeter than music looked on terrified
      stays in Maṇimāḍakkoyil in Thirunāgur
      where young buffaloes eat canes of sugarcane,
      plunge into the muddy water of the ponds
      and come out carrying mud on their horns.
      O heart, let us go to Nāngur and worship him.

1224. Our father who went into the pond of blooming lotuses,
      fought with the snake Kālingan,
      defeated him and danced on his head
      stays in Maṇimāḍakkoyil in Thirunāgur
      where gypsies ornamented with lovely bangles
      walk on the streets by the palaces where flags fly,
      and, standing in their front yards, sell pearls, saying,
      “We will give you precious pearls for white rice.”
      O heart, let us go there and worship him.

1225. Our father who stole the clothes of the cowherd girls
      with soft dark curly hair
      and played and kicked over their play houses,
      breaking them as their love for him increased like a flood,
      stays in Manimādakkoyil in Thirunāngur
      where young parrots with curving beaks
      repeat the sweet words of the Vedas
      that the beautiful girls with long spear-like eyes and shining teeth have taught them.
      O heart, let us go there and worship him.

1226. The lord is worshiped and praised by the gods in the sky saying,
      “You carry a shining discus and a conch.
      You fought with seven bulls
      to marry the cowherd girl Nappinnai and embraced her arms.”
      He stays in Manimāḍākkoyil in Thirunāngur
      where a red-legged swan stays with his mate
      in a beautiful pond and they play among the lotuses
      so their pollen falls on beautiful kazhuneer flowers
      and the honey from the flowers drips and falls into the channel.
      O heart, go there and worship him.

1227. Kaliyan, the devotee of him
      who is the king of Thirumangai surrounded with flourishing fields
      and groves swarming with bees,
      composed ten musical Tamil pāsurams on Neḍumāl
      in the Maṇimāḍakkoyil in beautiful Nāngur.
      If devotees learn and recite them well,
      they will become the kings of the wide world
      surrounded by oceans and ride on rutting elephants
      in the shade of white umbrellas that touch the sky,
      and they will rule the world and enjoy their lives.
