She says,
“My bangles grew loose and fell from my arms because of him
who wears a fragrant thulasi garland,
and carried Govardhana mountain with his strong mountain-like arms.
He stays in Thirukaṇṇapuram surrounded by the ocean
where waves roll and bring curved conches,
precious corals and creepers and leave them on the banks.”

1669. She says,
      “ My bangles grow loose and fall from my arms
      because I love him
      who rests on the ocean on the snake bed of Adisesha,
      and who terrified the elephant Kuvalayābeedam
      that had small heroic eyes and shed rut like rain
      and broke its tusks.
      He stays in Thirukaṇṇapuram filled with beautiful palaces
      where the smoke of fragrant akil wood rises up
      and touches the top of the hills where clouds float in the sky.”

1670. She says,
      “My tight bangles grow loose and fall from my arms
      because I love the lovely-eyed lord who fought and killed
      the seven strong-eyed bulls to marry Nappinnai
      and who was happy to remove the curse of the cool moon.
      He stays in Thirukaṇṇapuram where the moon rises
      and moves through the thick clouds
      above the decorations on the tall tops
      of the beautiful palaces studded with shining jewels.”

1671. She says,
      “My golden bangles grow loose and fall from my arms
      because I love the lord who was tied to a grinding stone
      by the lovely-armed cowherdess Yashoda
      when she became angry with him.
      He pulled that stone, going through and destroying the marudam trees
      whose form the Asurans had assumed.
      He stays in Thirukaṇṇapuram with long streets surrounded by strong walls
      and fragrant groves where groups of beautiful peacocks dance.”

1672. She says,
      “ My curved bangles grow loose and fall from my arms,
      for the lord who, as a little boy Kaṇṇan, ran around
      wiping his mouth when his mother Yashoda
      chased him with a small stick because he has stolen yogurt and eaten it.
      He stays in Thirukkaṇṇapuram where Vediyars make fires,
      perform sacrifices and recite the mantras of the Vedas.”

1673. She says,
      “My shining bangles grow loose and fall from my arms,
      because I love the dear lord who fought with Hiranyan,
      split open his chest with his strong nails and destroyed his strength.
      He stays in Thirukkaṇṇapuram
      where tall fragrant petaled thāzai flowers grow on the dunes
      and the corals left by the river shine like blinking eyes.”

1674. She says,
      “My shining bangles grow loose and fall from my arms
      because I love the dear lord who swallowed all the eight directions,
      the sun and moon, the large earth and the wonderful sky
      and spat them all out.
      He stays in Thirukkaṇṇapuram
      where clear waves bring beautiful pearls
      and pile them up in the shadow of Punnai trees
      blooming with blossoms where bees swarm.”

1675. She says,
      “My tight bangles grow loose and fall from my arms
      because I love the lord
      who rests on the snake bed Adisesha
      on the wide ocean rolling with waves
      and created Nānmuhan on a lotus on his navel.
      He stays in Thirukkaṇṇapuram
      where beautiful lotuses bloom like lovely faces
      and dark kuvalai flowers dripping with honey bloom like eyes.”

1676. She says,
      “My bangles grow loose and fall from my arms
      because I love the generous lord with a thousand names
      who rests on the thousand-tongued Adisesha.
      He stays in Thirukaṇṇapuram embracing on his mountain-like chest
      the beautiful Lakshmi with arms like bamboo
      and young breasts secured with a band.”

1677. Thirumangai, the famous king of Thiruvāli
      with its flourishing fields
      composed ten beautiful Tamil pāsurams
      on Vamanan the god of Thirukaṇṇapuram
      surrounded by the ocean with rolling waves
      and groves where honey drips from flowers.
      If devotees learn and recite these pāsurams
      their bad karma will have no results.
