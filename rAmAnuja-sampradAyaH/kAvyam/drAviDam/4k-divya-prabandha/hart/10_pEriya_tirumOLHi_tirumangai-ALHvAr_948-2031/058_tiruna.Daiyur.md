1518. Our Thirumāl took the form of a bachelor wearing a deerskin on his chest,
      went to king Mahābali, asked for three feet of land
      and measured the world and the sky with his two feet.
      I searched for him in Thiruvenkaṭam hills where honey drips on the slopes
      and I saw him in Thirunaṛaiyur.

1519. Our father, Thirumal, the lord of Thennāli
      churned the milky ocean,
      and in ancient times, at the end of the eon,
      he took the form of a fish and swallowed the ocean.
      I saw him in Thirunaṛaiyur
      surrounded with fields filled with good water.

1520. The lord came on Garuḍa, the faultless bird
      and killed the crocodile that had caught Gajendra the elephant
      on the bank of the pond and saved him.
      He is the god of gods and he has lovely lotus eyes
      and I saw him, the god of Thirunāvāy in Thirunaṛaiyur.

1521. The god of Thiruneermalai surrounded with groves
      took the form of a man-lion that never retreats,
      went to Hiraṇyan and split open his chest.
      I searched everyday for that lord
      with a thulasi garland that never withers and I saw him in Thirunaṛaiyur.

1522. He shot cruel arrows with his bow
      and split open the chest of the terrible Rākshasa Ravaṇa,
      the king of guarded Lanka surrounded with strong stone forts.
      He gave his grace to good Vibhishana
      even though he was the brother of his enemy Ravaṇa.
      I looked for that good lord and saw him in Thirunaṛaiyur.

1523. He created Nānmuhan on a lotus on his navel
      and Nānmuhan created all the worlds,
      the world of the gods and the creatures of the world.
      He is the Māyon, the lion-like son of Yashoda with eyes as sharp as arrows.
      I looked for our dear friend and saw him in Thirunaṛaiyur.

1524. He is the god of Meyyam
      who burned the forest Kāṇḍam filled with abundant groves,
      brought the Karpaga tree dripping with honey
      from Indra’s world for his wife Satyabama
      and planted it in Dwarakapuri.
      I searched for him and saw him in Thirunaṛaiyur.

1525. He drove the chariot for Arjuna in the Bharatha war,
      fought with the armies of his heroic enemies,
      conquered them and sent them to heaven,
      saving the people of the earth from their affliction.
      I searched for him and saw him in Thirunaṛaiyur.

1526. The lord, our king,
      carries a golden discus in his right hand
      that spreads light everywhere
      and in his left hand he holds a conch
      that brings him victory in battle.
      He stays in Thirukkuḍanthai
      filled with groves dripping with honey.
      I searched for my king and saw him in Thirunaṛaiyur.

1527. Kaliyan with arms as strong as mountains
      and adorned with fragrant garland dripping with honey
      composed ten pāsurams on the lord of beautiful Thirunaṛaiyur,
      the son of Vasudeva of everlasting northern Madurai.
      If devotees learn and recite these pāsurams
      they will become gods among the gods in the golden world of heaven.
