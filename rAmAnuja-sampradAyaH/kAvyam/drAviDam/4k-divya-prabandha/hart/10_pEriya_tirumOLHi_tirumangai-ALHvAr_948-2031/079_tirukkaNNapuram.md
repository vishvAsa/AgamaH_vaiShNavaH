1728. The dark cloud-colored lord
      who saved the long-trunked Gajendra from the crocodile,
      is a precious emerald-colored jewel,my dear one, Esan, my father,
      and I, his devotee, keep him in my heart and am saved.

1729. Thirumāl, as generous as rain,
      dear as a mother to all,
      a lustrous jewel colored like a dark cloud
      that removes the troubles of his devotees
      took nectar from the ocean and rests on Adisesha.
      I, his devotee, came to him for refuge and am saved.

1730. The highest god, the light of heaven,
      who killed seven bulls to marry Nappinnai,
      became angry at the king Rāvaṇa, crossed the ocean,
      went to Lanka and defeated the Rakshasas.
      I am a slave of that matchless lord of Thirukaṇṇapuram
      surrounded with fields with channels that flow with water
      and neelam flowers bloom,
      and I will never be the devotee of any other god.

1731. The matchless, highest one, the bright light,
      sweet as a fruit, the creator of the Vedas
      who shines like a golden hill
      entered my heart.
      I came to the god of large Kadihai hills,
      who is sweet as a fruit and I am saved.

1732. My father, you came to me,
      entered my heart and have not left me.
      This is enough for me.
      You are the young god of Kuḍanthai
      surrounded with groves blooming with bunches of flowers.
      I am fortunate—I received your grace and will never forget you.

1733. I do not want to go to cruel hell,
      I tremble even to think of it.
      O heart, he is the only one who can say,
      “Do not be afraid,” and save you.
      You should always be mindful of the young god of Vayalāli
      surrounded with palaces over which clouds float.

1734. O lord, you removed the curse of the beautiful crescent moon
      and you are my life.
      When my father and mother gave birth to me and left this world
      you took care of me like my own dear parents and raised me.
      How can I forget my lord? Tell me, O my poor heart!

1735. I, your devotee, was born in this world
      and plunged into the ocean of family life that wise people hate.
      Now I have received the grace of you,
      my mother-like god of Vayalāli
      surrounded with fields that are never dry without water.
      You have entered my heart,
      and I have received the boon of not being born again.

1736. He is the lord of beautiful Thirukkaṇṇapuram and Kaḍikachalam
      surrounded with fragrant cool lotus flowers.
      When will the time come that I can rejoice seeing with my eyes
      the god of Talaichangam
      who is the bright moon for the gods and the sun that spreads light?

1737. Kaliyan, the chief of Thirumangai,
      conqueror of his enemies with a strong spear,
      composed ten sweet musical Tamil poems
      on the cloud-colored lord of Thirukkaṇṇapuram.
      O devotees, sing these songs and dance
      and make the earth flourish.
