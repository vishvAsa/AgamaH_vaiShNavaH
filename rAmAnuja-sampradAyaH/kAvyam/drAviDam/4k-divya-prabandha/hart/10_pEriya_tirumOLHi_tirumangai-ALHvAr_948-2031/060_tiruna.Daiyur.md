      The divine name of Thirumāl is as sweet as honey, milk and nectar.
      I praise his name, and you, O friends, should also praise his name
      and say, “Namo Narāyaṇāya.”

1545. When the cows and the cowherds were shivering
      in a storm that poured a rain of stones,
      terrified, the cowherds worshiped the god
      and said, “We cannot bear this—you are our refuge!”
      and he carried the large Govardhana mountain as an umbrella
      and protected them all from the storm.
      Praise his name and say, “Namo Narāyaṇāya.”

1546. He, the beloved of the earth goddess
      surrounded by oceans that roll with waves
      and of lovely Lakshmi seated on the lotus
      is the lord of Nānmuhan, Shiva, Indra and the gods in the sky.
      Praise his divine name, say, “Namo Narāyaṇāya!”
      and your karma will be destroyed.

1547. Kaliyan the poet,
      the beloved of his queen with large eyes like kāvi flowers,
      composed a garland of ten musical pāsurams
      on Neḍumal of Thirunaṛaiyur
      on the bank of beautiful Muthāṛu surrounded by large ponds.
      If devotees keep his name in their hearts
      and praise it with their tongues,
      all their bad karma will be removed.
