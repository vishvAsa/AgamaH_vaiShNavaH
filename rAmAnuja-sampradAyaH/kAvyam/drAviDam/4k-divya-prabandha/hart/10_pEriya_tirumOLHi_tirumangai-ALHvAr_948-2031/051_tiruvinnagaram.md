1448. O lord, you are my ruler!
      I came and worshiped you
      who measured the world at Mahābali’s sacrifice
      as devotees and the gods carrying fragrant bunches of flowers
      swarming with honey-drinking bees and worshiped you
      so that their karma will be removed.
      If you give me your grace so I may see you,
      I will not want this family life, O god of Thiruviṇṇagar.

1449. You are the highest lord.
      When the milky ocean was churned,
      you saw Shiva with a forehead eye
      when he drank the poison that came from the ocean,
      and you gave the nectar that came out of the milky ocean to the gods
      and you loved Lakshmi who came from the milky ocean.
      If you give me your grace so I may see you,
      I will not want this family life,
      O god of Thiruviṇṇagar.

1450. You with your dark curly hair
      are the brother of the fire-colored Balaraman
      who bent his bow that was strong as a mountain,
      fought with his enemies
      and destroyed their lands with his fiery arrows.
      You are my ruler.
      If you give me your grace so I may see you,
      I will not want this family life, O god of Thiruviṇṇagar.

1451. O lord, you, my ruler,
      swallowed the bright moon, the sun,
      the world and all creatures at the end of the eon.
      You rested on a banyan leaf on the wavy ocean
      when you were a beautiful baby.
      If you give me your grace so I may see you,
      I will not want this family life,
      O god of Thiruviṇṇagar.

1452. O lord, you are my ruler.
      You swallowed all the seven worlds,
      seven oceans, seven mountains and the whole wonderful earth
      and kept them in your strong, handsome stomach.
      You have the form of one letter, “Shri.”
      If you give me your grace so I may see you,
      I will not want this family life,
      O god of Thiruviṇṇagar.

1453. O lord, you, my ruler,
      are the dark oceans, the mountains,
      the beautiful worlds and the four excellent Vedas,
      which you taught to the sages, giving divine knowledge to all.
      If you give me your grace so I may see you,
      I will not want this family life,
      O god of Thiruviṇṇagar.

1454. O my lord and ruler,
      in the evening when the Vediyars
      make sacrifices pouring fragrant ghee in fire
      and the gods come there in a group,
      joining them and they all recite the Rig Veda,
      you are the sweet music in their recitation.
      If you give me your grace so I may see you,
      I will not want this family life,
      O god of Thiruviṇṇagar.

1455. O lord, you, my ruler,
      are virtuous and you are adorned with a long crown
      decorated with opening blossoms.
      I am frightened to be in love
      with young women because it only makes me suffer
      and I approach your feet.
      If you give me your grace so I may see you,
      I will not want this family life,
      O god of Thiruviṇṇagar.

1456. O my lord and ruler,
      I do not want to be born or die in this world again and again,
      and so I come to your ankleted feet.
      You are the four Vedas recited by sages
      and you are the three gods in the sky.
      If you give me your grace so I may see you,
      I will not want this family life,
      O god of Thiruviṇṇagar.

1457. The famous Kaliyan composed
      Tamil pāsurams on Thiruviṇṇagar
      surrounded by blooming groves.
      If devotees learn and recite
      these musical pāsurams
      they will reach the feet of the lord Vāmanan.
