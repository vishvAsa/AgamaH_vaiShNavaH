1718. The cool lotus-eyed Kaṇṇan, the cowherd
      took the form of a strong fish and saved the world from the storm
      when the water rose up to the world of the gods at the end of the eon.
      I am his devotee and I found him in Thirukkaṇṇapuram
      filled with flourishing fields and forests.

1719. I am the devotee of the wise lord who took the form of a turtle
      and held Mandara mountain as a stick to churn the milky ocean
      and then took the nectar from the ocean
      and distributed it to the gods in the sky
      when there was a large flood at the end of the eon,
      and I found him
      in Thirukkaṇṇapuram surrounded by the roaring ocean.

1720. When the ocean rose and covered the whole earth with water
      our mighty father took the form of a boar with bent tusks
      and brought the earth goddess up from the underworld.
      I am his devotee and I found him in Thirukkaṇṇapuram
      filled with fields over which clouds float
      as herons searching for āral fish dive into the water
      and kayal fish, frightened, swim away.

1721. He took the form of a man-lion,
      angrily went to his enemy Hiranyan,
      fought with him and split open his chest with his sharp claws
      as the gods in the sky looked on in fright.
      I am his devotee and I found him in Thirukkaṇṇapuram
      where farmers reap and collect good paddy and save it in storage.

1722. Our father took the form of a dwarf,
      went to the sacrifice of king Mahabali,
      asked him for three feet of land
      and measured the world and the sky with his two feet.
      I am his devotee and I found him in Thirukkaṇṇapuram
      where in the plowed fields of paddy, precious as gold,
      budding mullai and kazuneer flowers blossom together.

1723. Our father took the form of Balarama
      carrying a mazhu weapon
      and he the god of Thiruppāzhi conquered twenty generations of kings.
      I am his devotee and I found him
      in Thirukkaṇṇapuram filled with fragrant groves
      where beautiful neelam flowers drip honey
      that the bees drink.

1724. Our highest lord was born as the undefeated king Rama,
      fought a cruel war in guarded Lanka
      with his enemies the angry Rākshasas and destroyed them.
      I am his devotee and I have found him
      who is worshipped by all
      in Thirukkaṇṇapuram where tāzhai plants spread their fragrance
      along the flourishing waterfront.

1725. Born as Balarama with an earring shaped like a plow
      in one ear and a simple earring in the other,
      the victorious lord fought and conquered many monarchs with spears.
      I am his devotee and I found him
      in Thirukkaṇṇapuram where Vediyars, scholars of the Vedas,
      make three sacrificial fires.

1726. Our father who was born as Kaṇṇan on a dark midnight
      took away the affliction of the earth goddess
      whose sweet mouth is red as coral and saved her from the underworld
      and fought in the Bharatha war
      and killed all the Kauravas, the enemies of the Pandavas.
      I am his devotee and I found him in Thirukkaṇṇapuram
      where ocean waves bring pearls and leave them on the banks
      and precious paddy plants wave in the fields.

1727. He took the forms of a fish, a turtle, a boar, a man-lion, and a dwarf
      and was born on the earth as Rama, Balarama, Parasuraman, Kaṇṇan and Kalki.
      Kaliyan, the devotee, composed musical pāsurams
      on the god of Thirukkaṇṇapuram.
      If devotees learn and recite these honey-like Tamil pāsurams
      they will not have the results of their karma.
