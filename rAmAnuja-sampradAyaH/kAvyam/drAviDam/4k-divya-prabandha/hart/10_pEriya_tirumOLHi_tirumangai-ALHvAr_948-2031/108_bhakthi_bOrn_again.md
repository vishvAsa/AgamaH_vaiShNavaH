2022. O Nambi, you are smell, taste, touch and sound.
      When I complain that you have not given me your grace,
      you may say that I did not do the right things.
      I will say one thing to you.
      Do not make me to go into a womb and be born again.
      I am afraid that I will be like a tree
      on the bank of a river that may fall at any time.

2023. Even though I am angry at you
      who carry a victorious discus, I would tell you this.
      I do not want you to put me in a womb and make me be born again.
      I tremble like the minds of people on a boat caught in a terrible storm.

2024. O my lotus-eyed Kaṇṇan,
      I have suffered, born in many births
      and I am worried and afraid
      that you will make me be born again.
      My mind struggles as if I were staying
      under the same roof as a snake.

2025. I am afraid that you, the lord of the eon,
      will make me be born in many more births and suffer.
      My mind is in pain like an ant
      caught on a torch burning at both ends.

2026. I have suffered, born in many births
      and I am afraid you, the ancient god of the eon,
      will make me fall into the hole of birth again.
      My mind shivers like a crowd of foxes caught in a flood.

2027. You are the Maṇāḷan of Vayalāli
      where beautiful neelam flowers bloom
      near the water filled with lovely blossoming lotuses.
      I should not suffer like a tree
      cut down by a shepherd and thrown away.
      Give me your grace so I may reach you.

2028. Like the worm that lives in a margosa tree
      and will not eat anything except its leaves,
      I do not want to be anywhere except beneath your beautiful feet.
      You, a shining light,
      removed the curse of the waning crescent moon
      and you rest on the five-headed Adeshesa.

2029. I want nothing but your grace.
      You are the god of Srirangam
      surrounded with beautiful groves,
      a jewel and a shining diamond.
      O Madhusudhana, you who are the highest light,
      show me the path that leads to moksha.

2030. O my father, show me a path
      so I will not be plunged into indestructible hell.
      Give us, your devotees, your sweet grace always.
      You are the Chandogya Upanishad, our chief with lotus eyes.
      O dear one, give your grace to me, your slave.

2031. Kaliyan, king of famous Thirumangai,
      composed ten pāsurams praising the cowherd,
      the god who protected the cows from the storm
      by carrying Govardhana mountain as an umbrella.
      If devotees learn and recite these ten pāsurams
      they will never experience the results of their karma. (1083)
