1578. Your devotees praise you saying,
      “O king of the gods!
      When you were a baby you drank poisonous milk
      from the breasts of Putanā with fire-like red hair,
      and her blood flowed out swiftly,
      her eyes became tired and she fell to the ground.
      You are a strong child,
      and you are the king of the gods in the sky.”
      You are the god of rich Thiruthaṇcheṛai
      surrounded with diamond-studded palaces
      that touch the crescent moon in the sky.
      See, folding my hands on my head, I worship
      those devotees who worship the feet of you, our god.
      .
1579. On his chest he keeps Lakshmi with long and sharp eyes like arrows.
      He is the dancer who threw the Asuran when he came as a calf
      at the Asuran who had taken the form of a vilām fruit
      and killed them both.
      If the devotees worship the feet of my divine god,
      in the temple of Thiruthaṇcheṛai
      surrounded with cool groves where bees swarm,
      they will stay in my heart always.

1580. In Thiruthaṇcheṛai where bees stir the pollen
      of the flowers and sing,
      devotees worship the god saying,
      “When Surpanakha with sharp bright teeth
      came like a lightning bolt before you,
      you cut off her nose and ears with your divine hands.”
      I worship the feet of those virtuous devotees
      who sprinkle water and flowers on the god’s feet
      and shine brighter than the gods in the sky.

1581. The god in Thiruthaṇcherai, ruler of the gods in the sky,
      has a mountain-like chest adorned with garlands.
      I will never leave the devotees who praise his names
      saying, “You shot arrows from your strong bow in the cruel war
      and killed the king of Lanka in the south
      who drove many chariots and carried a shining sword.”

1582. I will not worship the Jains with their dirty bodies
      or the Buddhists with their incessant arguing,
      I will only worship those who praise the god
      who took the form of a man-lion, fought with Hiraṇyan and killed him.
      My heart will be sweet always as if honey poured from it,
      when it thinks of the devotees of the lord,
      who worship the feet of our god of Thiruthaṇcherai,
      surrounded with fragrant blooming groves.

1583. I praise him saying, “You are an excellent god.
      In ancient times as a boar you dug up the earth,
      brought the earth goddess up and saved her.”
      I am his servant and have no help but him
      who stays in Thiruthaṇcheṛai
      surrounded with blooming groves swarming with bees.
      When I see his devotees, my heart and my eyes feel joy.

1584. I worship and praise him saying,
      “You, the Māyavan are virtuous
      and rest on the deep ocean on Adisesha the snake like a bright hill..”
      He saved me from the pleasures of my senses.
      I am his slave and I love the devotees who worship the divine feet
      of the dear lord of Thiruthaṇcheṛai surrounded by fields
      where bees swarm around beautiful neelam flowers.

1585. The gods in the sky and the people of the earth
      come and praise him whose feet are soft as tender shoots.
      He stays in Thiruthaṇcheṛai
      surrounded by flourishing groves where bees swarm and sing.
      If devotees see him with their eyes, melting in their hearts
      and worshiping him folding their hands,
      cruel Yama will not hurt them
      and the results of bad karma will not come to them.

1586. My heart melts for the devotees
      who keep his feet in their hearts
      and worship the lord of Thiruthaṇcheṛai
      where, as the farmers weed in the paddy fields,
      they crush karuneelam flowers with their feet
      and the fragrance of the flowers spreads as their honey flows.

1587. The poet Kaliyan, Yama to his enemies,
      who drives swift chariots yoked with horses,
      composed ten musical pāsurams on the god
      resting on Adisesha on the water in cool Thiruthaṇcheṛai
      where swans beneath the shadows of a mango trees
      are with their mates that walk like women
      wearing flowers in their dark hair.
      O devotees! Fold your hands together
      and worship his pure golden feet.
