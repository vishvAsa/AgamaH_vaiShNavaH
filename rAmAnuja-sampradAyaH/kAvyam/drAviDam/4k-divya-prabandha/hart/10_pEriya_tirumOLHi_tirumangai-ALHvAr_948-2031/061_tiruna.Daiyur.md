1548. Like a young calf that craves its mother’s milk
      I call you unceasingly.
      You, our Nambi, stay in Naṛaiyur
      surrounded with groves dripping with honey.
      Give me your grace so I will not be born again,
      my father and my god.

1549. Ancient and famous,
      you swallowed all the oceans that never dry
      and the seven hills.
      I have no one—I am your slave.
      I call you, I come to you.
      Give me your grace, my father and lord.

1550. You gave me your grace
      and I will not give it away to anyone else.
      I drink your grace and relish it—it is never enough for me.
      You have the dark color of the ocean
      and are like a mountain, O god of Thirukkoṭṭiyur.
      You are happy to have me as your devotee
      and I, your slave, have received you with joy.

1551. When I called you and said,
      “O faultless one, you split open the beak of the bird,”
      you entered my heart and gave me peace.
      You are unique, you are a thief,
      you are sweet as sugarcane, you are generous,
      you rest on the ocean in Thirumallai.
      How could I forget you?

1552. As if you were a strong elephant,
      you wandered in the cruel mountainous forest
      with Sita, your wife with long spear-like eyes
      and a beautiful forehead like a bow.
      You are good, you are Narayaṇan
      and you took the form of a man-lion.
      Tell me, how can I bow to you and worship you?

1553. You are a treasure of coral, a sage,
      you are the light of Thirumuzhikkaḷam
      and you stay in the divine hills of Thirupridi surrounded with snow.
      You are a fruit sweet as nectar,
      and a sweet drink for your devotees.
      I found you and I am saved.

1554. You are a treasure,
      you are a garland of pearls on Thiruneermalai
      and I have no other refuge but your grace.
      If your devotees praise and worship you, you give them refuge.
      I found you and I am saved.

1555. If I call you saying,
      “You are my lord. You are Hari,”
      others mock me and say I am crazy.
      You are a pearl, a precious diamond,
      a tender shoot that sprouts up.
      How could I leave you?

1556. You are pure,
      you have cool lotus eyes,
      you are like the beautiful shining moon,
      and like a mother you give your love to all creatures.
      O cowherd, you swallowed all the worlds
      surrounded with seven ocean roaring with waves.
      How could I forget you?

1557. Kaliyan, the devotee of the god,
      composed a garland of musical Tamil pāsurams
      on him, the god of Thirunaṛaiyur
      surrounded by groves swarming with bees.
      O devotees, if you sing these pāsurams and dance,
      you will go to heaven and your troubles will disappear.
