1118. She asked her neighbors,
      “The sound of worship of the people in the three worlds
      was like the roaring waves of the ocean
      when he came as a man-lion with sharp teeth and red hair shining like fire
      and split open the chest of the Asuran Hiranyan
      while Shiva, burner of the three forts, and Nānmuhan on the lotus
      saw and worshiped him. Who is he? Tell me.”
      They replied, “He told us he is from Aṭṭapuyaharam.”

1119. She asked her neighbors,
      “Who is he? I do not know.
      Is he a strong heroic warrior?
      Do the gods in the sky recite Vedic hymns and worship him?
      Do the singers sing beautiful Tamil songs?
      Did he take the form of a dwarf at the sacrifice of Mahabali,
      grow to the sky and measure the earth?
      Who is he? Tell me.”
      They replied, “He told us he is from Aṭṭapuyaharam.”

1120. She asked her neighbors,
      “He carries arrows that shine like pure gold,
      a strong bow, a club, a conch, the shining sword Nanthaham,
      a discus, a shield and flowers.
      He broke the white tusks of the strong angry elephant
      Kuvalayabeedam and killed it.
      Who is that dark cloud-colored one?”
      They replied, “He told us he is from Aṭṭapuyaharam.”

1121. She asked her neighbors,
      “Our Mayavan carried Govardhana mountain
      that shone like a precious jewel covered with clouds
      and saved the cows from the storm.
      Did he take the tusks of the elephant Kuvalayabeedam?
      I don’t know his māyam.
      He carries a shining discus and a conch and stays among the Vediyars
      like a beautiful light in the sky. Who is he?”
      They replied, “He said he is from Aṭṭapuyaharam.”

1122. She asked her neighbors,
      “He gave the arts, the Vedas, the books on morals,
      the garbhasutras, grammar, philosophy and all other things
      to the gods in the sky and to the world.
      He has a strong mountain-like body
      and he is ornamented with precious jewels.
      Lakshmi on a lotus stays on his chest.
      Who is he with a conch in his hand?”
      They replied, “He said he is from Aṭṭapuyaharam.”

1123. She asked her neighbors,
      “I don’t know anything about him.
      He attracts the minds of girls and steals their chastity
      and enters their hearts.
      He makes their conch bangles loose.
      He has the color of the rising dark ocean, a puuvai bird,
      a kāyām flower, a blossoming neelam flower or thick clouds.
      Who is he?”
      They replied, “He said that he is from Aṭṭapuyaharam.”

1124. She asked her neighbors,
      “How can I describe the beauty
      of the thulasi garland that adorns him, swarming with bees?
      His body is fragrant with sandal paste
      and his lotus eyes look like a picture painted by a master.
      He has a majestic chest and arms and a beautiful mouth.
      Who is this handsome one?”
      They said, “He said he is from Aṭṭapuyaharam.”

1125. She asked her neighbors,
      “He taught the Vedas to the sages
      while the gods, standing in all the directions, worshiped him.
      He, the beloved of the earth goddess,
      has the color of the ocean
      and carries a sounding conch and a discus in his hands.
      His eyes are like beautiful kāvi flowers.
      He is tall and he is like my life. Who is he?”
      They said, “He said he is from Aṭṭapuyaharam.”

1126. She asked her neighbors,
      “I belong to him and my bangles don’t stay on my hands.
      My heart doesn’t want to stay with me.
      Even my waist that is thin as a vine
      has opened its mouth and said that it belongs to him.
      His look kills me like poison.
      I don’t understand him and I am afraid of him. Who is he?”
      They said, “He said he is from Aṭṭapuyaharam.”

1127. Kaliyan, the chief of Thirumangai
      surrounded by strong beautiful walls praised by all
      composed with sweet music a garland
      of ten pāsurams on Neḍumal adorned with long thulasi garlands,
      the god of Paramechura Viṇṇagaram
      worshiped by Vayiramehan,
      the famous king of Kacchi of the Thondai country.
      If devotees learn and recite these pāsurams, worshiping him,
      they will go to Vaikuṇṭam.
