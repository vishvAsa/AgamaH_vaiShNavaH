1658. Her mother says,
      "O faultless god of the gods
      with the lovely color of a precious jewel who know everything,
      my daughter worships Kaṇṇapuram
      surrounded with crashing water.
      Is she a thief like you?
      Is it right for you to make her bangles grow loose?

1659. “My daughter stands in the courtyard
      where the bright moon shines and looks around
      and points to Kaṇṇapuram and says, ‘See that!’
      She loves that Paṇanār so dearly
      and she is not ashamed to express her love for him.
      Surely she wants to go to Thirunaraiyur.”

1660. “My daughter prattles and says,
      ‘Thiruvenkaṭam is a mountain filled with divine waterfalls
      that flow with abundant water,’
      and she asks, “Where is Meyyam?”
      and says, ‘Kaṇṇapuram has excellent fame.’
      Her heart melts with his love and she grows weak.
      What is this?”

1661. “My daughter doesn’t eat all day.
      She doesn’t sleep.
      She is innocent and young, not old enough to fall in love yet.
      He is worshiped by all in Kaṇṇapuram.
      How could she fall in love with the dark ocean-colored Kaṇṇan?
      Why does she do this?”

1662. “My lovely daughter worships Kaṇṇapuram
      where Kaṇṇan stays.
      When she says, ‘I am a girl and I love the god,’
      she is telling the truth.
      Perhaps if she hears someone tell her how he stole and ate butter
      and how Yashoda tied him to a mortar,
      the pallid color of her body will change back to normal.”

1663. “My daughter says, ‘I came to Thirukaṇṇapuram
      from Thirumalai in the north to be with the lord.’
      My beautiful daughter is innocent.
      Does she owe him anything?
      She cannot sleep at all.”

1664. “If my daughter hears the sound of the rolling waves of the ocean
      or sees the cool moon that shines bright she feels distress.
      She has been suffering like this for many days.
      She always says her only wish is to go to ancient Srirangam
      where the god stays who split open the mouth
      of the Asuran when he came as a horse.”

1665. “All devotees go to Thirukkaṇṇapuram
      to worship your feet and you protect them.
      My daughter sees that and wants to go there and worship you.
      The jewel-like body of my innocent daughter
      with hair that swarms with bees has grown pale.
      Do you think it is right to make her suffer like this?”

1666. “My daughter does not have all her teeth yet.
      Her hair has not yet grown thick
      and you can’t say that she understands things. What can I do?
      She wants to see the god in Thirukkaṇṇapuram
      filled with groves blooming with flowers that drip honey.
      How can I think this child is really innocent?”

1667. Kaliyan, Yama to his enemies,
      praised by all the people of the world,
      the king of Thirumangai filled with clouds in the sky
      composed ten wonderful divine pāsurams.
      If devotees learn and recite these pāsurams
      they will live long with fame on this earth surrounded with oceans.
