1798. The good-natured god who has with him Shiva
      wearing a garland of skulls and a tiger skin around his waist
      stays in Thirukkuṛunguḍi
      where a heron fledgling climbs on the small branch of a tree,
      takes a veḷḷiṛa fish from its mother and eats.

1799. Our pure lord resting on Adisesha on the ocean
      where the waves never cease rolling
      stays in Thirukkuṛunguḍi
      where male red-legged swans live with their mates
      on the beautiful lotuses that drip with honey
      in cool flourishing fields.

1800. We have found the way to be saved. THIRUMAL
      O devotees, come and see!
      Our lord with a dark cloud-color and beautiful eyes
      who took the form of a boar
      to save the earth goddess from the underworld
      stays in Thirukkuṛunguḍi
      where a heron searches for food in the flourishing paddy fields
      to take to his beloved red-legged mate.

1801. The heroic god who went to Lanka
      fought and pierced the chest of the ten-headed Rakshasa Rāvaṇa
      and cut off his hands -
      stays in Thirukkuṛunguḍi
      where bees that make honey swarm night and day in the mandram
      and kuravam blossoms spread their fragrance everywhere.

1802. The lord who drove the chariot in Bharatha war
      for the five Pandavas and destroyed the heroic Kaurava kings
      fighting as they rode their strong elephants -
      stays in Thirukkuṛunguḍi where parrots
      with mouths like sweet kovvai fruits
      speak like beautiful women
      with eyes that are bright and darkened with kohl.

1803. O devotees, come,
      take lamps, water, beautiful flowers and fragrances,
      sprinkle pure water and worship the lord.
      The ocean-colored god wishes to stay in Thirukkuṛunguḍi
      where the palaces touch the crescent moon in the sky.

1804. O devotees, if you want to remove the desires
      that you have for women with vine-like waists,
      go to Thirukkuṛunguḍi and worship the lord
      where the mullai buds blooming slowly in the backyard of the houses
      are as beautiful as the teeth of the women
      with mouths as sweet as fruits
      and with beauty like that of Lakshmi.

1805. O friends, take fresh flowers strung together into garlands
      and go lovingly to Thirukkuṛungudi
      and worship the highest lord there
      where male herons with sharp beaks live
      with their mates in the fields and eat fish from the water
      while sharp-beaked nārai birds play with their mates.

1806. O devotees,
      if you want to be rid of the results of your bad karma
      and the troubles of your lives,
      carry fresh flowers and worship the lord in Thirukkuṛunguḍi
      where night and day the lined bees sing
      and the fragrance of the mullai flowers
      from the hills spreads everywhere in the mandram.

1807. The good poet Kaliyan composed a musical garland
      of beautiful pāsurams on the lord of Thirukkuṛunguḍi
      who shot arrows, destroying Lanka
      and who killed the angry elephant Kuvalayābeedam
      with murderous tusks.
      If devotees learn and sing this musical garland of pāsurams,
      their karma will disappear.
