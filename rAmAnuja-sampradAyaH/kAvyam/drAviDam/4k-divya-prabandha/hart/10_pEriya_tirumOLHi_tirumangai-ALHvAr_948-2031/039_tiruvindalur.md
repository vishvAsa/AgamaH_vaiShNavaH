1328. We, your slaves and servants,
      worship you, our father who stay in Indalur.
      We have enjoyed all the pleasures of this birth.
      Won’t you be kind to us?
      Give us your grace and show us the divine path.
      Isn’t that the way for us to survive?

1329. You, our father, the god of Indalur
      are a treaure that never disappears from our hearts.
      You are our sweet god of Thiruvāli and you embrace us.
      You are the young elephant of Thirumalirunjolai,
      bright like an everlasting lamp.
      O Nambi of Thirunaṛaiyur,
      have pity on me and give me your grace—I am you slave.

1330. This is how I praise you,
      “You with hair adorned with garlands swarming with bees
      measured the world with your two feet.”
      Longing to see you we plunged into the ocean of devotion
      and grew exhausted when we couldn’t see you.
      See how others look at us and mock us
      because we are crazy about you, O god of Indaḷur!

1331. We praise you, saying we long to see you,
      but you do not show us your grace,
      and we wander through all lands as your slaves.
      O dear lord! Won’t you show us your bright form shining like a kāsi flower?
      O lord of Indaḷur, you are cheating us.
      If that is what you want, do as you wish.

1332. Even though you, the dear lord,
      are fire, water, all the directions and this large earth,
      we, your slaves, cannot see you.
      You are our mother, our father and grandfather.
      O lord of Indalur, won’t you give your grace to your slaves.

1333. I won’t go away without telling you what I think of you.
      You think of me the same as you think of your other devotees.
      I am your slave and I will not leave you.
      You know who is good, who is bad
      and you know everything in the world.
      The only thing you don’t know is what I want, O lord of Indalur!

1334. We have caught hold of you so we can serve you,
      but you don’t tell us how to serve you.
      Should we have to tell that you are the god of Indalur?
      We, your devotees, have come to your place
      because we want to see you.
      Won’t we be saved if you show yourself to us?

1335. From ancient times you have had the white color of milk,
      and always you have the color of the dark clouds.
      If someone thinks of you, you are precious gold for them,
      yet your body is the color of a dark sapphire.
      O god of Indalur, show us your real color.

1336. My father, his father, his father,
      and all for seven generations were your devotees and worshiped you.
      You try to see whether we are suitable to be your devotees.
      You have entered the hearts of your other devotees,
      but you don’t show me the color of your divine body, O god of Indalur.

1337. Kaliyan, the chief of Thirumangai
      composed a sweet garland of ten pāsurams
      praising our father, the god of Indalur
      surrounded by lovely groves.
      If devotees, whoever they are, learn and recite these ten pāsurams
      they will become the god of the gods in the sky.
