1038. O lord, you who crossed the ocean
      and fought and killed the king of Lanka surrounded by oceans
      stay in the majestic Thiruvenkaṭam hills,
      worshiped by the gods in the sky.
      I am your slave. Remove my troubles.

1039. O lord, you who are adorned with a thulasi garland,
      fought and destroyed the clan of Rakshasas
      and the king of Lanka and raised your Garuda banner
      stay in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills that has tall peaks.
      Give me your grace.

1040. You are sweet nectar.
      You, my father, who swallowed the whole world
      and the ocean with its abundant water
      and rested on a beautiful soft fresh banyan leaf
      stay in the famous Thiruvenkaṭam hills.
      I am your slave. Give me your grace.

1041. You, the god of the gods who stole the fragrant butter
      from the uri and ate it as if it were nectar,
      and took the form of a dwarf,
      measured the world and the sky with your two feet
      stay in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills with peaks that touch the sky.
      I am your slave. Give me your grace.

1042. You, the god of the tall majestic Thiruvenkaṭam hills,
      took the form of a pillar, split it open,
      emerged from it in the form of a man-lion
      and killed the Asuran Hiranyan.
      Your arrows never fail to hit their targets.
      Protect me.

1043. The matchless god, my king who himself is me,
      saved me from never-ending births on the earth
      and gives me his sweet grace.
      He stays in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills
      where clouds float with shining lightning-
      and he is my dear father and he is in my heart.

1044. You are as sweet as honey
      and you have hands strong as mountains.
      You who killed the seven bulls opposing them
      to marry the doe-eyed Nappinnai
      stay in rich Thiruvenkaṭam hills.
      O my king, you live in my heart.

1045. Our lord is far and near
      and he, the Māyan stays in my heart.
      I know nothing except the feet of the cowherd
      who stays in the divine Thiruvenkaṭam hills
      where white pearls shining like diamonds
      spill out, splitting open the bamboo.

1046. You, our father, our Nambi,
      our cintamani, are a bright light that never diminishes.
      You came to me, entered my heart and abide there.
      O god of the Thiruvenkatam hills, sfrom now on I will not leave you ever.

1047. Kaliyan, the poet with strong mountain-like arms
      composed a garland of pāsurams
      praising the dear sapphire-colored god of the Thiruvenkaṭam hills
      where many hunters with bows live.
      If devotees learn these pāsurams and praise him
      they will become gods in heaven.
