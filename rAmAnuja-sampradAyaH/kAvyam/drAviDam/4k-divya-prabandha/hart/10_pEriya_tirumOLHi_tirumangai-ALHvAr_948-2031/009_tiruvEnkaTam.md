1028. I thought that my mother, father, wife
      and relatives were important.
      I suffered, became your slave, and like a dog
      I have come longing to see you in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills
      where you stay surrounded with fragrant groves with blooming flowers
      and thick round bamboo plants.
      You are my refuge.
      Give me your grace and protect me.

1029. Intoxicated, I fell in love
      with beautiful women with lovely doe-like eyes
      and I have committed many sins in this large world
      that will only lead me to hell.
      You stay in the divine Thiruvenkaṭam hills
      surrounded with groves blooming with flowers that drip honey.
      Where are you?
      I came to you and you are my refuge,
      Protect me. I am your slave.

1030. O lord of the Venkaṭam hills,
      I had no purpose in my life and killed many lives.
      I never said kind words to those who needed my help.
      You stay in the flourishing Thiruvenkaṭam hills
      where mountain-like clouds float and thunder.
      I came to you the day I realized my faults.
      You are my refuge.
      Protect me. I am your slave.

1031. I was born in many communities in many births
      and died and was born again and again
      and I am very tired of being born.
      I have done nothing good or any good dharma
      and have gained nothing in my births.
      You stay in Thiruvenkaṭam hills
      where clouds take water from the earth and float in the sky.
      I came to you and you are my refuge.
      Protect me. I am your slave.

1032. I have committed many kinds of sin
      and I have suffered and I am tired.
      You are omnipotent and I do not even have the strength
      to come to you and worship your feet.
      You stay in majestic Thiruvenkaṭam
      surrounded by mighty hills and praised by all.
      O my father, you are my refuge.
      Protect me. I am your slave.

1033. I am caught in this wounded body
      that is made of earth, water, fire, wind
      and the sky where clouds float
      and I have suffered, cried, and grown tired and weak.
      You stay in the fragrant Thiruvenkaṭam hills
      with tall peaks that touch the sky.
      I have come to you—you are my refuge.
      Protect me. I am your slave.

1034. When I was young, I did not know anything
      and did many wrong things.
      After I became older,
      I worked hard for others and became poor.
      You, strong as a lion, stay in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills
      surrounded by beautiful blooming groves
      where many elephants live.
      I have come to you and you are my refuge.
      I am your slave. Protect me.

1035. I did tapas in many births because I longed to see you.
      O lord, I have worshiped you in this birth always,
      yet I still suffer living on this earth.
      You stay in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills
      surrounded by flourishing groves
      where honey from the branches flows.
      I cannot bear the troubles that I have in these births.
      I have come to you and you are my refuge.
      I am your slave. Protect me.

1036. I have no one to depend on.
      Committing only sins I became a sinner—
      I don’t know how to do anything else.
      Māyan, you are our Madhavan,
      god of the Thiruvenkaṭam hills
      where lotuses bloom in the springs
      and honey flows on the slopes.
      I have come to you and you are my refuge.
      I am your slave. Protect me.

1037. Kaliyan, the chief of Thirumangai
      surrounded with strong beautiful palaces
      composed ten musical pāsurams
      praising the dark cloud-colored god,
      as precious as eyes for all
      and the life of all creatures of the seven worlds.
      He, the creator of the Vedas, is praised by the gods in the sky
      and he stays in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills
      surrounded by flourishing groves.
      If devotees learn and sing these ten pāsurams
      they will experience no results of their karma.
