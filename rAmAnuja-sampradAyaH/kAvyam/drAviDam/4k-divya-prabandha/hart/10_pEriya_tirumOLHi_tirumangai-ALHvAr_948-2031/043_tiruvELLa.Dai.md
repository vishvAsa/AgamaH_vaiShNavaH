1368. O divine lord who came as Parasuraman carrying a mazhu
      and conquered many kings for twenty-seven generations,
      you stay in Thiruveḷḷaṛai where fragrant breezes
      enter the mango groves and the mandrams
      and make the jasmine and mullai bloom.
      Give me your grace and show me a way
      to reach and worship your ankleted feet .

1369. You who, taking the form of a horse,
      brought the Vedas and taught them to the sages
      when Nānmuhan, seated on a lotus had lost them
      stay in Thiruveḷḷaṛai
      where a breeze blows though the tall Madhavi trees
      and spreads fragrance through all the streets
      and in the groves and in all directions.
      Give us your grace.

1370. You who split open the chest of the cruel Hiraṇyan
      with your long claws
      when he afflicted the people of all the seven worlds and killed him
      stay in Thiruveḷḷarai
      where in the beautiful ponds dark varāl fish
      frolic and play and lotus plants spread divine fragrance.
      Give me your grace.

1371. You, the god of the Thiruvenkaṭam hills filled with bamboo,
      who drove the chariot for Arjuna in the Bharatha war
      and helped him conquer the Kauravas with galloping horses,
      and gave their kingdom to the five Pandavas
      stay in Thiruveḷḷarai where the beautiful cuckoo
      plucks pollen from the flowers of the mango trees
      and then, to take away the sour taste,
      drinks the honey-like juice of sweet jackfruit.
      Give us your loving grace.

1372. You who as a boar split open the earth, went beneath the ocean
      and brought up the earth goddess with beautiful spear-like eyes
      when she was hidden by an Asuran
      stay in Thiruveḷḷarai where mullai plants in the forest
      climb on the sugarcane, seeming to smile
      with their white buds and blossoms as bees drink their honey.
      Give me your grace.

1373. You, the ancient lord took the form of a turtle
      and helped the gods and the Asurans
      churn the milky ocean to get the nectar that you gave only to the gods
      who, adorned with beautiful crowns, worshiped you.
      You stay in Thiruveḷḷarai
      where bees that have lovers’ quarrels with their mates
      fly to the hair of beautiful women
      and the tops of the palaces touch the moon.
      I am your slave. Give me your grace.

1374. You who bent your bow and cut down
      the ten heads of the Rākshasa Rāvaṇa adorned with long crowns
      stay in Thiruveḷḷaṛai where bees sing sweetly
      drinking honey from flourishing lotus flowers
      with green emerald-like leaves. Give me your grace.

1375. When the world grew dark and everyone became dull-witted,
      and the gods in the sky worshiped you asking you to give them knowledge,
      you took the form of a swan and taught them the Vedas.
      You stay in Thiruveḷḷaṛai where surumbu bees
      and many kinds of other bees
      swarm around the blooming screw pine plants and mango trees
      singing beautifully with the sound “tena tena.”
      Give me your grace.

1376. You, the highest one, who went to the sacrifice of king Mahabali,
      begged him for three feet of land and then cleverly measured the earth
      and the sky with your two feet
      stay in Thiruveḷḷaṛai filled with groves
      where bees fly to the asoka trees and swarm around their red flowers
      and the cuckoo birds coo loudly when they see those red flowers
      because they think that the bees have caught fire.
      I worship you. Give me your grace.

1377. Kaliyan, the poet skilled at throwing poisoned spears in battle,
      composed ten pāsurams on the ancient god,
      the nectar, the divine, whose color is dark as kohl
      who stays in Thiruveḷḷarai filled with shining palaces over which clouds float.
      If devotees sing these ten pāsurams without pausing
      they will become the kings of the gods.
