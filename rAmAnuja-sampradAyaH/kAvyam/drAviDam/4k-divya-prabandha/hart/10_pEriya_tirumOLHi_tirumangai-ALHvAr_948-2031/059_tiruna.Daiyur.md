1528. O heart, go and reach the feet of the divine one
      who took away the trouble of Shiva
      when he wandered through all the three worlds
      and begged, carrying the skull of Nānmuhan.
      Our lord stays in Thirunaṛaiyur surrounded with fields
      where a handsome male swan, without leaving his mate,
      opens the petals of a lotus and drinks honey.

1529. O heart, go and reach the feet of the divine god
      who shot his fire-like arrows
      and made the ten crowns of the strong ill-famed Rākshasa Rāvaṇa fall.
      He stays in Thirunaṛaiyur where the Kaviri
      that nourishes the land and makes it flourish
      brings shells from the salt pans
      and leaves them on the street with the pearls that they gave birth to.

1530. O heart, the younger brother
      of the white conch-colored Balaraman,
      who ate the churned butter
      and swallowed all the three worlds
      stays in Thirunaṛaiyur
      where the juice of sweet jackfruit flows
      and banana trees ripen with abundant fruits
      in the flourishing groves.

1531. O heart, let us go and worship the ankleted feet of the lord,
      who carried with his arms as strong as hills
      Govardhana mountain as an umbrella,
      stopping the storm and saving the cows and the cowherds.
      He dances in the mandrams in rich Thirunaṛaiyur
      where the palaces are lined up next to one another
      and many flags that fly high reach the sky and hide the clouds.

1532. O heart, let us go and worship the golden feet of Kaṇṇan
      who hid the sun with his shining discus in the Bharatha war,
      and swallowed all the seven worlds and kept them in his stomach.
      He stays in Thirunaṛaiyur
      where the wonderful Ponni river with rolling waves
      brings abundant akil wood, sandalwood,
      precious gold and beautiful pearls
      and leaves them on its banks.

1533. O heart, let us go and worship the lotus feet of the almighty
      who joyfully keeps gentle Lakshmi
      with a waist as thin as lightning on his handsome chest.
      He stays in Thirunaṛaiyur where the marvelous Ponni river
      with its cool shining waves brings gold, pearls, lion claws
      and the tusks of huge elephants and leaves them on its banks.

1534. O heart, let us go and worship the soft feet
      that are as tender as shoots of the divine dark cloud-like Kaṇṇapirān,
      the king of the gods in the sky with a fresh thulasi garland in his hair.
      He stays in Thirunaṛaiyur where red lotuses bloom
      among the paddy growing everywhere with rich clusters of seeds
      and sugarcane plants flourish, giving sweetness to the world.

1535. O heart, let us go and worship the ankleted feet of the lord
      who stays eternally in Thirunaṛaiyur
      surrounded with abundant groves
      where there are trees with clusters of betel nuts,
      unripe fruits, young kamugu trees and bamboos that hold pearls.
      That land is filled with many palaces
      that are like hills, studded with precious stones.

1536. O heart, let us go and worship the feet of the lord
      who was worshiped by Shiva with the crescent moon in his matted hair and by Nānmuhan.
      He stays in rich Thirunaṛaiyur
      where the smoke from the large sacrificial fires
      of Vediyars reciting the Vedas rises and hides the clouds.

1537. Kaliyan, the chief of Thirumangai
      surrounded by flourishing fields where the moon shines bright
      composed ten musical pāsurams on the god
      of Thirunaṛaiyur surrounded by strong walls.
      If devotees learn and recite these ten pāsurams
      they will go to the sky and live with gods.
