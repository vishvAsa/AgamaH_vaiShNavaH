1108. Her mother says,
      “Even though my daughter with a lovely face
      as beautiful as the white shining moon
      knows that Lakshmi born in the milky ocean with its nectar
      stays on your chest, she does not stop loving you.
      She is as beautiful as the doll in the kolli hills
      and her lovely eyes are like kuvalai blossoms.
      She loves to worship your feet.
      What do you think of her in your heart,
      O father, lord of Thiruvidaventhai?”

1109. Her mother says,
      “My daughter doesn’t smile at her friends
      with her mouth as sweet as a pomagranate fruit.
      Her breasts are not smeared with sandal paste.
      Her waterlily eyes are not decorated with kohl.
      She doesn’t wear lovely fresh flowers in her hair.
      She just repeats the word “Thirumāl,”
      the name of him who measured the world
      surrounded by the abundant water of the ocean.
      What do you think of this lovely young girl,
      O father, lord of Thiruvidaventhai?”

1110. Her mother says,
      “If my daughter wears sandal paste and pearl garlands
      on her round breasts, they burn her.
      The white moon that rises in the evening
      sheds hot rays and makes her weak.
      When she hears the sound of the roaring waves
      of the ocean she prattles and prattles,
      her beautiful body that has the color of a mango shoot becomes pale
      and her bangles grow loose and fall from her hands.
      What do you think of that beautiful girl
      decorated with precious ornaments,
      O father, lord of Thiruvidaventhai?”

1111. Her mother says,
      “My poor daughter says that one nazihai is longer than an eon.
      She asks her friends,
      ‘When will this bright sun go to sleep?
      Why does the ocean grieve?
      Why doesn’t the andril bird sleep?
      The breeze is more cruel than fire for me.
      Both my breasts hurt.
      You are my friends. Tell me what I can say.’
      What do you think of my daughter as precious as gold,
      O father, lord of Thiruvidaventhai?”

1112. Her mother says,
      “My daughter doesn’t say anything at all except your name.
      She melts whenever she thinks of your divine form.
      Her love for you keeps growing and making her suffer.
      She thinks only of you and can’t do anything else.
      Her long fish-like eyes can’t close in sleep.
      I am innocent myself, but I can’t bear the childishness of my daughter.
      My girl, her waist as thin as a vine, is really in love with you.
      Now people are gossiping about her—can you help her,
      O father, lord of Thiruvidaventhai?” ”

1113. Her mother says,
      “My daughter doesn’t think of any of the things
      that she should do for her own family.
      When she heard the words that the god she loves
      destroyed the strong clan of the Rakshasas in Lanka
      surrounded with strong forts and the wide ocean,
      she was happy. She is fascinated with you.
      Her soft breasts are pale as gold and her waist is like a thin vine.
      Can’t you think of doing something to help her,
      O father, lord of Thiruvidaventhai?”

1114. Her mother says,
      “When my daughter thinks of you, her heart melts
      and she prattles on about you. She only loves you.
      She doesn’t feel any affection for me, her mother.
      She prattles and says,
      ‘You are the Mayan, you stay in Thirumalirunjolai
      surrounded by groves where sweet fruits ripen.’
      Her smile is sweet as a kalam fruit.
      Her mind worries always and she feels weak.
      What do you think you can do for her, sweet as a fresh fruit,
      O father, lord of Thiruvidaventhai?”

1115. Her mother says,
      “My daughter says,
      ‘He has strong arms—I long for the love of that cowherd
      and my heart longs to taste his lips soft as ambal flowers.
      I want to go to Thiruneermalai
      surrounded by flourishing fields where waterbirds sing.’
      She is our beautiful daughter and lovely as the doll on Kolli mountain.
      She has a vine-like waist and her eyes shed tears like rain.
      What do you think you can do for her,
      O father, lord of Thiruvidaventhai?”

1116. Her mother says,
      “Her soft arms have become pallid and gold.
      Her fish-like eyes do not close and she can’t sleep.
      She loves you beyond any limit.
      I don’t know what sickness my beautiful girl has.
      Her waist is like lightning,
      and her lovely round breasts are swelling out.
      What could have happened to her?
      What do you think you can do for her,
      O father, lord of Thiruvidaventhai?”

1117. Kaliyan, with a strong spear, the king of Thirumangai
      surrounded by strong walls and beautiful palaces
      composed these ten pāsurams on our father, the god of Thiruviḍaventhai.
      His devotees worship him saying,
      “You are the Māyan who took the forms
      of a swan, a fish, a turtle and a man-lion,”
      and he gives them his grace.
      If devotees learn and recite these ten pāsurams
      they will be released from their old karma.
