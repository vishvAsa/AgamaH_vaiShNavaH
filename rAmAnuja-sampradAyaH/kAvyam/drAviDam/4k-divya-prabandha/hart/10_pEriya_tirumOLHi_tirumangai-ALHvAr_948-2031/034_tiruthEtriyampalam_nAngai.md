1278. See, as Kaṇṇan, the lovely-eyed Thirumāl
      who destroyed the shining crowns of his enemies,
      their strength and their fame
      and made their wives shed their ornaments,
      cut the chain on the anklets of his father and released him from prison,
      and saved the elephant Gajendra from the crocodile
      stays in Thiruthetriyambalam in Nāngur
      where thousand-petaled lotuses bloom
      and the branches of young kamugu trees
      drop white pearls into the holes where crabs live.

1279. See, our lovely-eyed Neḍumal
      who drank poisonous milk from the devil Putanā
      when she came as if she were the mother who bore him,
      wearing golden bangles on her hands,
      stays in Thiruthetriyambalam in Nāngur
      where neelam flowers bloom abundantly in the midst of paddy lands
      and the music of dark-winged bees
      and the tinkling of the anklets on women’s small feet
      sound softly together.

1280. See, Thirumāl with beautiful eyes who entered the small palm-leaf huts of the sharp spear-eyed cowherd women,
      stole and ate the good butter that they had churned and kept
      and stole and hid their clothes and upset them
      stays happily in Thiruthetriyambalam in Nāngur
      where the Kaviri river brings and piles up mangoes
      that have dropped from their trees when coconuts have fallen on them,
      and its water, covered with flowers
      and flowing between the mounds, is split into small channels.

1281. See, our dark cloud-colored Kaṇṇan with lovely eyes
      who fought the dark angry bulls with curved horns and strong legs
      to marry Nappinnai, the beautiful daughter of the cowherds,
      stays in the Thiruthetriyambalam temple in Nāngur
      where beautiful blooming groves
      embrace the tops of the diamond-studded palaces
      and touch the shining moon.

1282. See, he is the young Thirumāl with lovely eyes
      his arms as strong as mountains.
      Making their ornaments touch his chest,
      he embraces beautiful wide-hipped Lakshmi
      and the cowherd girl Nappinnai with dark eyes and pearl-like white teeth
      and a shining diamond necklace around her neck.
      He stays in Thiruthetriyambalam in Nāngur
      where shining palaces like small hills
      are next to each other on the large streets
      and women with sweet voices
      attract men with their bow-like eyebrows,
      capture them and make them live in their hearts.

1283. See, when the Rākshasa king Ravaṇa
      realized that a king like himself had risen up,
      he thought he could defeat Rama but when he fought with him
      Rama cut off his twenty mountain-like arms and killed him.
      Our lord stays in Thiruthetriyambalam
      where lovely women with soft doe-like eyes,
      red mouths and prattling words as sweet as honey
      carry on their hands beautiful green emerald-colored parrots
      and teach them to speak baby talk and wander in the streets.

1284. Our beautiful-eyed lord, as a naughty dwarf,
      wearing a shining divine thread on his chest
      and a skin dress around his waist,
      went to the sacrifice of the enemy of the gods, king Mahābali,
      where Vediyars recited the auspicious Vedas
      and asked the king to give him three feet of land
      and when he received the boon,
      he measured the whole earth and the sky with his two feet.
      He stays in Thiruthetriyambalam in Nāngur
      where water mixed with kumkum and sandal paste
      from women’s breasts adorned with fresh flower garlands
      flows on the white sand and turns it red.

1285. See, our king, the lovely-eyed Thirumāl took the form of a boar
      ornamented with anklets with small bells that made the sound “gana, gana” on his feet as large as a Meru mountain,
      who went to the underworld
      and brought up the earth goddess on his tusks
      as Lakshmi on his chest trembled
      stays in Thiruthetriambalam in Nāngur filled with wealth
      where Vediyars recite the four divine Vedas, the six Upanishads
      and the sastras and sing the seven kinds of music
      making the sound spread in all the eight directions.

1286. At the end of the eon, our lovely-eyed Thirumāl
      swallowed all the seven worlds, the seven mountains,
      everything in the eight directions, the earth, the sky,
      the oceans and the flood and kept them in his stomach.
      He stays in Thiruthetriambalam in Nāngur
      where shining diamond-studded palaces touch the sky
      and famous Vediyars, scholars of the four Vedas, recite eon after eon.

1287. Kaliyan with a sharp beautiful spear,
      the king of Thiruvāli filled with palaces where flags fly,
      praised by the whole world,
      composed ten pāsurams on Thirumāl
      who stays in Thiruthetriyambalam in Nāngur
      where diamond-studded palaces shine.
      If devotees learn and recite this garland of pāsurams,
      they will rule this beautiful world as kings
      and go to the highest sky and shine as gods.
