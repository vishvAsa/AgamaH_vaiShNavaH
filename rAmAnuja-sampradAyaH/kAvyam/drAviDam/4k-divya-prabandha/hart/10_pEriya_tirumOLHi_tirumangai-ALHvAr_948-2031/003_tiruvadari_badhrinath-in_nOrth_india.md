968. When you become old,
     you will need to walk holding a stick.
     Your legs will be so weak
     you can only walk very slowly,
     looking down at the ground.
     O heart! Before old age comes to us,
     let us go to the temple at Thiruvadari
     and worship him who killed Putanā
     when she came to him
     disguised as a mother to cheat and kill him.

969. When you become old, your back will be bent
     and you will need a stick to walk.
     You will tremble. You won’t be able to see.
     You will always be coughing.
     Young women will look at you and mock you, saying,
     “Look at him. He was young once, but now he is an old appar.”
     O heart! Let us go to the temple in Thiruvadari
     where bees sing as they drink honey
     and worship the lord.

970. When you become old.
     your nerves will become like hanging strings.
     Your muscles will be weak.
     Your mind won’t be able to think.
     You won’t be able to find the way to the places you want to go to.
     Your eyes will not be able to see and you will tremble.
     O heart! Before old age comes to us, know this:
     we should recite the thousand names of him
     with love and go to Thiruvadari
     where intoxicated bees drink honey and sing his praises.

971. When you become old,
     your eyes will have discharge and shrink.
     You will have bile and cough continuously.
     Your feet will twist around each other
     and you will struggle to walk.
     Before these things happen to us,
     O heart, let us go to Thiruvadari
     surrounded with cool ponds where vālai fish frolic
     and worship the lord who grazed the cows in a cowherd village
     when he was young
     and carried Govardhana mountain as an umbrella
     to protect the cows and the cowherds.
     Let us go to Thiruvadari and worship him.

972. When you were young you loved young women.
     You drank the nectar of their mouths,
     enjoyed them and lived a rich life.
     When you become old you will remember those things
     but you will cough continually and hold a stick to walk slowly.
     O heart! Before old age comes,
     let us go to Thiruvadari where bees sing in the groves
     and worship the lord adorned with a cool thulasi garland.

973. When you become old, you will have trouble speaking.
     Your chest will be filled with phlegm
     and your body will be weak.
     You will be like a madman,
     unable to think well and talk coherently.
     He is the ancient one, dark-colored, our master,
     our father, and the bright light
     and he churned the deep milky ocean for the gods in the sky.
     O heart! Before old age comes,
     let us go to Thiruvadari and worship him.

974. Young girls with breasts like small boxes
     will mock you when you are old and say,
     “Look at him, the pappar appar, it’s too bad he’s gotten old.
     Think how this man was when he was young and see him now,”
     and they will laugh at you.
     He is our wealth and life.
     O heart! Before old age comes,
     let us go to Thiruvadari and worship him.

975. When you are old
     the young women with eyes like kuvalai blossom who loved you before
     will say now, “Chi, chi, go away, don’t stay here.
     You cough all the time and are weak.
     Aren’t you ashamed to be here, in your old age?”
     O heart! If you want to abandon the passion
     that leads you to women and destroys you,
     search for the good path and go to Thiruvadari
     and worship the almighty adorned with cool fragrant thulasi garlands.

976. When you become old, your five senses will grow weak
     and you will be lonely and unable to move around.
     Your heart will grow weak and you will get many diseases,
     with cramps, coughing and phlegm.
     You will talk incoherently.
     O heart, before old age comes,
     let us carry a fresh thulasi garland, recite his thousand names
     and go to Thiruvadari where devotees sing, dance
     and praise and worship him.

977. Kaliyan, the chief of Thirumangai,
     surrounded with fences of screw pine flowers,
     composed ten pāsurams about Neḍumāl
     in Thiruvadari where bees drink sweet honey and live.
     If devotees go there with thulasi garlands,
     sing, dance and praise him,
     they will go to heaven in the sky.
     I know no place they will go
     except heaven where they will enter and rule.
