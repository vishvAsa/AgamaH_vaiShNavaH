+++

1588. When his father Vasudevan was imprisoned by Kamsan,
      Kaṇṇan broke the chains that bound his feet
      and his father took him to a cowherd village
      in the middle of the dark night.
      He stays in Thiruvazhundur filled with beautiful streets
      where the rain falls without stopping
      and where Vediyar, never aging, recite the Vedas
      and light sacrificial fires in the morning, afternoon and evening.

1589. The god of gods who drove the chariot for Arjuna in the Bharatha war
      and destroyed the Kauravas with their mighty army
      stays in Thiruvazundur
      surrounded with flourishing fields
      where cranes, frightened of large vālai fish,
      fly away and come back again to catch
      small āral fish in the pond.

1590. The strong god who with his divine arrows
      cut off the ten heads of the king of Lanka in the south
      surrounded by precious golden forts
      stays in Thiruvazundur
      where bees drink honey from the branches of Madhavi vines
      and come and swarm around the flowers
      in the hair of beautiful women with sharp arrow-like eyes.

1591. Our god who lay on a banyan leaf in the flood
      and entered my heart so he is always in my eyes
      stays in Thiruvazundur surrounded with rich fields
      where a male bird goes with its beloved mate
      and searches for food for their fledglings in the wet fields.

1592. The god who is day and night,
      earth and sky, matchless light and darkness
      stays in Thiruvazhundur filled with cloth flags
      where the dust from running chariots
      and the smoke of akil from women’s hair look like clouds.

1593. Smiling with his beautiful blooming lotus mouth
      he came near me, gave his grace and entered my heart.
      He stays in Thiruvazhundur filled with beautiful streets
      where the sulam decorations on the tops of palaces
      touch the rain-giving clouds
      and the sound of celebration on the streets never ceases.

1594. The lord who came in the evening,
      stayed on my flower-like bed and entered my heart
      making my eyes that are like neelam blossoms fill with tears
      stays in Thiruvazhundur
      where the bright diamond-studded palaces
      on the long streets touch the sky
      and the smoke rising from sugarcane presses, hides the hot sun.

1595. The lord who came in the dreams of the women
      with waists as thin as vines and embraced them
      as they folded their hands and worshiped him
      stays in Thiruvazhundur
      where the sound of the golden anklets
      on the soft cotton-like feet of women as lovely as statues, never stops.

1596. That pure lord who came yesterday, stole away
      the feelings of my five senses and my beauty,
      and made my golden ornaments loose and left me -
      stays in Thiruvazhundur
      surrounded with flourishing fields
      where lined bees swarm on the lotuses
      in the ponds with water that never dries up
      as male swans play with their mates.

1597. Kaliyan, the poet who fights with his enemies like Yama,
      the king of Thirumangai where cuckoo birds sit on the bushes
      that are covered with flourishing vines,
      composed ten Tamil pāsurams with rich words
      praising the god of Thiruvazhundur
      where blooming kuvaḷai flowers are like women’s eyes,
      kumudam flowers in the water are like their mouths
      and the alli flowers are bright like their faces.
