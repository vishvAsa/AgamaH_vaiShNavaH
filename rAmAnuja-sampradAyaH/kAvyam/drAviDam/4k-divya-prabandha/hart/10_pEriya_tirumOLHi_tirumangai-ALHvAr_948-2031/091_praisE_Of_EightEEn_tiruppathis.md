1848. He is my relative and my dear life,
      my precious wealth and the lord who gives me moksha.
      I saw him yesterday in Thiruneermalai
      and today I will see him in Kaṇṇamangai
      surrounded with flourishing paddy fields.

1849. He is gold and a shining diamond,
      the beautiful lightning
      that stays on the top of the Venkaṭam hills.
      He is my dear lord and he rules me.
      I will go see him in Thiruthaṇgā.

1850. Thirumal who is sweet as milk and nectar,
      and lies on a banyan leaf as a baby on the ocean
      is adorned with green thulasi garlands.
      I will find joy seeing him in Thiruvāli
      and then I will go to Nangur
      and see him in front of the nyalal tree.

1851. He, undiminished light,
      split open the body of the Rākshasa Hiraṇyan.
      I will worship him in Thirupperur
      and I will go to Thiruveḷḷaṛai to see him
      who is unlimited sweet nectar
      and the light that gives grace to the gods.

1852. I saw the god of Thirunaṛaiyur.
      who removed the curse of Shiva who wears vibhuti
      and dances in the burning ground.
      He entered my heart and made it melt.
      I will go to Meyyam and see him, strong as a bull.

1853. He is the sky and the generous god
      who gave the divine nectar to the gods
      and killed the elephant Kuvalayābeeḍam.
      I will see him, sweet as honey,
      in Thirucherai surrounded with flourishing fields.
      I will go to Thirukkuḍandai and see the king of the gods there.

1854. I will find happiness in Veṇṇai-Thiruvazhundur
      seeing the cowherd who is loved by women with beautiful hair.
      I will go to Thirupāndaḷpāzhi
      where the king of gods wishes to rest on Adisesha
      and I will go to Thiruvekka after that.

1855. He, life for all his devotees,
      shines like the white moon.
      I will go and worship the god of Thirumalirunjolai,
      the seed of all creatures
      who is adorned with precious jewels,
      a pearl, a diamond and a ruby.
      He stays in Thiruviṇṇagar
      and I will go there and see him.

1856. The dancing one with sounding anklets on his feet
      frightened the strong elephant and broke its tusks.
      I will go and see him in Thirukkoṭṭiyur
      where the groves bloom with flowers
      and I will go see my friend in Thirunāvāy.

1857. Kaliyan, learned in many sastras,
      composed ten pāsurams on the god Manāḷan,
      the cowherd who protected the cows and stays in Thirupperur.
      If devotees learn and recite these wonderful poems
      they will not have any trouble in their lives and they will rule the world.
