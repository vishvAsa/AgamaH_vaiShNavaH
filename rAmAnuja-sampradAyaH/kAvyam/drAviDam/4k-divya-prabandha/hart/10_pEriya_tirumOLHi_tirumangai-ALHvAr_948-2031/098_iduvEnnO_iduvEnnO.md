1922. A cowherd girl says to Kaṇṇan,
      “You didn’t come on the day you said you would to see me,
      but wearing earrings in your ears and lovely clothes on your waist
      and a cool tulasi garland shedding its pollen on your chest
      you come here now and stand behind me.
      What is this? What is this?”

1923. A cowherd girl says to Kaṇṇan,
      “You wear an orange dress, your hair is tied up in a knot
      and you have tied a kachu around your waist.
      You come near the door in the backyard and stand there.
      What do you want? What is this? What is this?”

1924. A cowherd girl says to Kaṇṇan,
      “You, matchless, carry an eagle banner
      and you killed Sakāṭāsuran when he came as a cart,
      and now you come into our home in our village and frighten us.
      What are you doing in the night like this?
      What is this? What is this?”

1925. A cowherd girl says to Kaṇṇan,
      “You are the sweet Nāraṇan with many names adorned with thulasi garlands.
      You come like Kāma, the god of love, sing songs
      and enter our homes.
      Why are you doing this in the middle of the night?
      What is this? What is this?”

1926. A cowherd girl says to Kaṇṇan.
      “Your hair is long and curly, you carry a small sword
      and you are adorned with many golden ornaments
      studded with beautiful diamonds.
      You have come into our front yard
      and you smile and just stand there.
      Why do you do this? What is this? What is this?”

1927. A cowherd girl says to Kaṇṇan.
      “You left the cowherds and their cows,
      carrying a curved victorious bow,
      and now you look to see if anyone is around
      and enter our homes when no one is there.
      Why are you doing this where others might see?
      What is this? What is this?”

1928. A cowherd girl says to Kaṇṇan,
      “You, our beloved, fought the wrestlers with your strong arms.
      Last night we already knew what you wanted.
      You always go away without telling us when you will come back,
      and if you do tell us, you never come when you said you would.
      O god! What is this? What is this? What is this?”

1929. A cowherd says to Kaṇṇan
      “You are faultless.
      You entered a pond, caught the snake Kālingan
      and danced on his heads.
      You don’t think we’re as important to you as you used to—
      you have many good girlfriends.
      O god! What is this? What is this? What is this?”

1930. A cowherd girl says to Kaṇṇan.
      “You are a handsome young man.
      The goddess of wealth Lakshmi
      and the earth goddess stay with you,
      but you join the beautiful cowherd girls
      and dance the kuravai dance with them.
      O my friend, do you see this?
      What is this? What is this? What is this?”

1931. Kaliyan who has strong mountain-like arms
      composed a garland of pāsurams
      describing how the cowherd girls,
      quarrel during the day with lotus-eyed Kaṇṇan.
      If devotees learn and recite these pāsurams and worship the god
      they will have no sorrow in their lives.
