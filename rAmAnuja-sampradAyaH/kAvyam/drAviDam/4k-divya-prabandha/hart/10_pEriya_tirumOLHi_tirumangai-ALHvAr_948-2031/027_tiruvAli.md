1208. Her mother says,
      “Is he a thief? I don’t know who he is.
      A dark one like a bull came to my daughter,
      as innocent as a doe and with a waist thin as a vine,
      and he said, ‘Come.’
      He took her hand ornamented with silver bangles and went with her.
      She left me, her mother.
      I gave birth to her but she went with him.
      Will they go to the beautiful Thiruvāli
      flourishing with muddy fields?”

1209. Her mother says,
      “O, friend, he is a cowherd and he is naughty .
      When he entered our home and kissed my daughter on her mouth,
      as red as a thondai fruit,
      she was happy and walked behind him prattling like a parrot
      and her eyes shone like keṇḍai fish.
      Will they go to beautiful Vayalāli
      surrounded by the seashore swarming with bees?”

1210. Her mother says,
      “O my friend, he is strong and fearless.
      I was afraid when I heard that he had cut off the nose of Surpanaha,
      a woman of the Rākshasa clan.
      My daughter with round arms and feet as soft as cotton
      went with him and people are gossiping about her.
      Will they go to Vayalāli
      surrounded with cool beautiful fields and blooming vines?”

1211. Her mother says, “Was he ever born,
      that young one who went as a messenger
      blowing his conch to Duryodhana for the Pandava kings?
      Tell me where he comes from.
      Tell me, I don’t know.
      She went with Madhavan, her beloved companion.
      Will they go to famous Vayalāli surrounded with ponds
      where bees swarm around the flowers in the groves?”

1212. Her mother says,
      “My daughter with round arms and feet soft as cotton
      doesn’t worry about me, her mother.
      She fell in love with Madhavan, the Mayan, and left me.
      She is as beautiful as a creeper
      and walks like a female swan,
      swinging her round bamboo-like arms.
      Will they go to Punalāli?”

1213. Her mother says,
      “I gave birth to her and thought she would be my help,
      but she left me without thinking that I would be lonely.
      The god of Thiruvarangam who gave a boon to the gods
      saying that he would help them
      went to Lanka and destroyed the Rākshasas.
      Will she go to beautiful Thiruvāli with her sweet companion?

1214. Her mother says,
      “She didn’t worry that we are her father and mother.
      She wished only to embrace the ample arms of her beloved.
      Not even lightning or a vine can be compared to her waist.
      She followed him.
      Will they go to Punalāli surrounded with punnai groves and swans?”

1215. Her mother says,
      “My daughter, soft as a flower garland
      ornamented with precious jewels,
      left her play house, green parrot, ball, swing
      and soft-speaking puvai bird and went away.
      Did I not give birth to her?
      She went behind him
      who has no beginning and is worshiped by all.
      Will they go to Vayalāli?”

1216. Her mother says,
      “She is as lovely as Lakshmi on a fragrant lotus
      and her eyes are as beautiful as kāvi flowers.
      She has round bamboo-like arms
      and walks like a white-feathered swan.
      She went with Neḍumāl.
      Will the village gossip about her?
      Will they go to Vayalāli surrounded with rich fields and cool ponds?
      Is she doing all this
      because I am her poor mother and gave birth to her?”

1217. Kaliyan who carries a spear and fights angrily with his enemies
      composed ten Tamil pāsurams
      about how a beautiful vine-like girl went alone,
      taking Neḍumal as her companion
      and leaving her mother to worry about her.
      If devotees learn and recite these pāsurams,
      they will reach heaven and be with the gods.
