    A worried mother!

1318. My daughter says, “He is Kaṇṇan, the king
      whose body has the color of a dark cloud or a kuvalai flower,
      who broke the tusks of the elephant that eats balls of rice
      and he stays in Nāngai where tall palaces are studded with pearls.”
      My innocent daughter's mouth, as precious as coral,
      sings the praises of his Pārthanpaḷḷi temple
      where he abides with Lakshmi, his beloved wife.

1319. My daughter sings his praise and says,
      “Strong as a bull, he defeated the elephant Kuvalayābeeḍam sent by Kamsan,
      and he, the Māyan, killed the devil Putanā
      when she came to cheat him taking the form of a mother.
      He, the lord of the gods, stays in ancient Nāngai
      where Vediyars live, skilled in the sastras.”
      My daughter with feet as soft as cotton
      sings the praise of his Pārthanpaḷḷi temple.

1320. My daughter says,
      “The lord of Indra, the king of the gods.
      the dear one, the everlasting Māyan,
      who is sought always by the four Vedas,
      stays in Thirumallai where bees swarm in the groves.
      embracing naughtily the breasts of the cowherd girls.”
      She is not as before and she has changed
      and sings and praises his Pārthanpaḷḷi temple.

1321. My daughter’s bangles are loose and she is weak. She says,
      “The Māyan who destroyed the forts of Lanka surrounded by the ocean
      stays in ancient Nāngai where rich Vediyars live, skilled in the sastras.”
      She, ornamented with many bangles,
      sings and praises his Pārthanpaḷḷi temple.

1322. My daughter says,
      “The faultless one became the king of the monkeys,
      went to Lanka surrounded by the deep ocean
      and destroyed the Rākshasas with his heroic bow.
      He stays in ancient Nāngai
      filled with abundant tall palaces that touch the shining moon.”
      She only sings and praises his Pārthanpaḷḷi temple,
      but the people of the village gossip about my innocent girl..

1323. My daughter says,
      “The god of the gods with the beautiful color of the dark ocean
      who swallowed all the worlds and spat them out
      stays in Nāngai surrounded by fields where fish frolic.”
      Her speech is as sweet as milk
      as she sings and praises the Pārthanpaḷḷi temple.

1324. My daughter says,
      “The precious god of the gods cannot be found
      even by the Vedas that search for him,
      but he came and entered my heart.
      He stays in Nāngai where many bees with wings
      always swarm in the groves.”
      Her soft feet are ornamented with pādahams
      as she sings and praises the Pārthanpaḷḷi temple.

1325. My daughter says,
      “The matchless lord who is praised and loved by the whole world
      carries a shining discus and cannot be approached
      even by the bright moon, the sun or the gods in the sky.
      He stays in Nāngai that is like a thilakam of the southern land,
      where Vediyars skilled in the Vedas live.”
      She sings and praises his Pārthanpaḷḷi temple
      and people gossip about my innocent daughter.

1326. My daughter says,
      “Kaṇṇan, is the joy of the gods
      and the ancient one of all the seven worlds.
      All the gods sprinkle flowers on him,
      loving and worshiping him in their hearts.
      He, the lord of the gods, stays in Nāngai
      that is filled with tall mighty palaces.”
      She speaks with soft words as sweet as music
      and sings and praises his Pārthanpaḷḷi temple.

1327. Kaliyan, the poet with a sharp spear,
      composed ten Tamil pāsurams
      describing how a mother spoke of the love of her daughter
      for the god of the Parthanpaḷḷi temple where good Vediyars live,
      learned in the four Vedas and praised by the world.
      If devotees learn and recite these ten pāsurams well
      they will go to divine Vaikuṇḍam and live happily.
