1778. She says,
      “ The sorrowful calling of the andril bird
      that stays on the long branch of the palm tree in the grove
      is more cruel than the pain of a spear making a wound.
      I fold my hands and worship the lord of Thiruppullāṇi
      where the fragrance of the flowers spreads everywhere.
      O my friend beautiful as a statue!
      Do you think this worship will become a habit for us?”

1779. She says,
      “As a dwarf, he, the king, measured the whole world,
      and as a swan he taught the Vedas to the sages.
      I fell in love with him and my body became pale.
      O birds, you live in the golden-colored salt pans on the banks of the ocean.
      Go and tell the lord of Thiruppullāṇi of my love for him.”

1780. She says,
      “My lonely heart went everywhere searching for him
      who is adorned with a thulasi garland.
      Has it lost its way?
      I fold my hands and worship him in Thiruppullāṇi
      where the waves of the sea crash on the shore.
      Go and tell him how I suffer with my love for him.
      Why does he stand silently like a divine statue.”

1781. She says,
      “He came as a man-lion and split open the chest
      of the strong Hiranyan with his claws.
      Will he give his grace to us?
      I fold my hands and worship him
      in Thiruppullaṇi where the dashing waves roll.
      My flower-like eyes are filled with tears
      and my garment has grown loose and doesn’t stay around my waist.”

1782. She says,
      “ My heart has gone to the strong archer Rama
      who shot his arrows in battle in Lanka and killed the Rākshasas.
      Even if everyone scolds me and gossips about me,
      I will stay here believing the lies
      that my dear lord of Thiruppullāṇi told me
      until my heart returns.”

1783. She says, “The hot shining sun goes on his chariot,
      wanders all day and sets in the evening.
      My heart burns cruelly, paining me all day in the heat.
      I fold my hands and worship him in Thiruppullāṇi
      surrounded with blooming groves and flourishing ponds.
      I have lost my beautiful color and my conch bangles.”

1784. She says,
      “The sound of thunder and the ringing of the cowbells
      never cease, burning me even more than fire.
      I fold my hands and worship him in Thiruppullāṇi
      filled with beautiful jewel-studded palaces.
      I have done bad karma.
      The wind from the ocean blows hot on me.”

1785. She says,
      “He broke the tusks of the hollow-trunked elephant
      and rests on Adisesha on a snake bed and gives his grace to us.
      I fold my hands and worship him in Thiruppullāṇi
      where the cherundi trees shower golden flowers.
      The crescent moon with its mark sheds hot fire on me.”

1786. She says,
      “He, the ancient god who is the Vedas, the sky,
      the sun and the moon gives his grace to us.
      I fold my hands and worship him in Thiruppullāṇi
      surrounded with punnai trees blooming with opening buds.
      I and the waves of the ocean do not sleep.”

1787. Kaliyan, the poet with strong mountain-like arms,
      composed pāsurams describing how a girl with a waist like lightning
      loves our father, the lord of Thiruppullāṇi
      surrounded with punnai trees blooming with golden flowers.
      If devotees learn and recite these pāsurams well
      they will rule this earth as kings and also rule the sky.
