1168. The lord danced on a pot,
      went between two marudam trees and killed the Asurans,
      wrestled with the Mallars sent by Kamsan and killed them,
      killed Kesi when he came in the form of a horse,
      and grazed the cows and protected them and the cowherds
      from a terrible storm using Govardhana mountain as an umbrella.
      The god of Thillai Chitrakuḍam surrounded with high blooming groves
      comes on the street with victory.

1169. Kaṇṇan, the lord of Thillai Chitrakuḍam
      who drank the poisonous milk of the devil Putanā and killed her,
      comes on the street with victory
      as the cowherd women sprinkle flowers that drip honey on him and say,
      “He is the husband of the lovely earth goddess
      and of Lakshmi seated on a lotus swarming with honey-drinking bees.”
      He stays in Thillai Chitrakuḍam.

1170. The lord walked between two Marudam trees
      and killed the wrestlers as all the people in the eight directions
      bowed to him
      while the gods in the sky and people praised his heroism and strength
      reciting his thousand names.
      The god of Thillai Chitrakuḍam comes on the street with victory
      as the cowherd women scold him saying, “He stole and ate our butter.”

1171. When Kaṇṇan plunged into a cool pond blooming with lotuses
      fought and danced on the head of the sharp-toothed snake Kālingan,
      the gods in the sky, astonished, looked on
      and the long-eyed cowherd women ornamented with bangles
      were frightened to see him
      and called the other cowherd women to come.
      He, the god of Thillai Chitrakuḍam,
      comes on the street with victory.

1172. Kaṇṇan, dark as a rain-giving cloud,
      wears on his chest a thousand garlands,
      gold ornaments and pearls that shine like a waterfall.

      the daughter of a cowherd,
      comes with victory on the street of Thillai Chitrakuḍam.

1173. Victorious Kaṇṇan, the god of Thillai Chitrakuḍam,
      comes on the street riding the divine Garuḍa
      that looks like a beautiful mountain
      as all the people of the world bow to him, praise him and say,
      “He destroyed Lanka shooting arrows at the Rākshasas.
      He saved the cows and the cowherds
      carrying Govardhana mountain as an umbrella.”

1174. Kaṇṇan, the heroic god of rich Thillai Chitrakuḍam
      where gods come and bow to him
      comes on the street looking like a mountain of kohl
      as the cowherd women with beautiful long eyes like kāvi flowers
      fold their hands in worship, praise him and say,
      “Who could do this heroic deed except him?
      Angry at the strong elephant Kuvalayābeedam, he killed it.”

1175. The god of Thillai Chitrakuḍam
      who took the form of a man-lion
      dancing with a thousand arms, two fire-like eyes
      long sharp teeth and a gaping mouth,
      and went, fought with Hiraṇyan, terrifying him,
      and splitting open his chest
      comes victoriously on the street.

1176. The god of Thillai Chitrakuḍam
      colored like a dark cloud comes on the street victorious,
      holding a discus and a conch in his hands
      as the heroic gods of the sky surround him
      and all the seven worlds worship and praise him
      while Nappinnai, the daughter of cowherds,
      the earth goddess and beautiful Lakshmi accompany him.

1177. Kaliyan, the chief of Thirumangai
      who carries a spear and fought with his enemies
      composed ten beautiful Tamil pāsurams
      on the god of Thillai Chitrakuḍam
      filled with blooming groves dripping with honey.
      If devotees recite these ten Tamil poems
      they will not experience the results of their bad karma.
