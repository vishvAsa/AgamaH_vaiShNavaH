     he crossed the forests where deer, elephants and horses wandered,
     built a bridge with stones over the wave-filled ocean,

     surrounded with oceans and forts.

     O heart, let us go there and worship him.

991. The faultless god of Kuḍandai
     who bent his bow and conquered the Rakshasas
     when they came like a flood to fight in their chariots

     drank the poisonous milk of Putanā

995. When Shiva, adorned with a garland of skulls
     and smeared with ashes on his body
     wandered all over the world as a beggar
     because Nānmuhan had cursed him
     and went to our lord and asked him,
     “You are my father. Remove my curse,”
     our lord took water precious as nectar
     as if it were blood from his divine chest,
     sprinkled it on Shiva’s hands and made Nānmuhan's skull fall.
     He stays in Sālakkirāmam
     surrounded with groves flourishing with sandal trees.
     O heart! Let us go there and worship him..

996. O heart, let us go to the temple in Sāḷakkirāmam
     surrounded with flourishing fields where fish frolic,
     groves swarm with bees and cool lotuses bloom.
     Groups of devotees, gods in the sky
     and Andaṇars skilled in the Vedas, wearing sacred threads on their chests,
     go there and worship and praise him saying,
     “O god of gods! Give us your grace!” Let us go there.

997. Kaliyan, the chief of Thirumangai,
     composed a musical garland of ten Tamil pāsurams
     on the god of Sālakkirāmam
     surrounded with fields where herons eat grain and live.
     If you want to go and rule the world of the gods
     where wise people and devotees go,
     recite the thousand names of him
     or just babble these Tamil pāsurams again and again.
