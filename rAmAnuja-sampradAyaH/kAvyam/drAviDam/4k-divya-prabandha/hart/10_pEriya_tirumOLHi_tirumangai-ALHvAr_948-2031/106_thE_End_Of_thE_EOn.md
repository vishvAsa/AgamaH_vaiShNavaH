+++

2002. At the end of the eon,
      he swallowed all the gods’ worlds
      and the people of the seven worlds
      surrounded with dark oceans
      and he kept them in his divine stomach for a long time.
      Think about it, O devotees.
      You worship the gods of other religions who are our enemies.
      What good did they do for us? Don’t be ungrateful.
      Worship only our lord in the sky
      who carries a discus smeared with oil.

2003. When the abundant flood came at the end of the eon
      and rose to the sky, the lord with his strong hands
      took all oceans with their water and swallowed them all.
      Everyone knows this.
      Is there anyone in the world or among the gods
      who was not swallowed and spit out by our god?
      O devotees, don’t you know that the world
      is here through his grace?

2004. He swallowed and kept in his stomach
      Shiva with an eye in his forehead, Nānmuhan, the god of the Vedas,
      Indra who rides the white elephant Airāvadam
      and all the other gods and he protected them there
      so that the victorious king of the ocean would not swallow them all.
      It is terrible that mean devotees
      do not praise the good nature of the lord with a victorious discus.

2005. At the end of the eon, the waves of the ocean
      spread everywhere in the world
      and the whole earth became a large ocean.
      He thought that all the seven worlds
      would be destroyed and he swallowed them all
      and kept them in his divine stomach, making it very large.
      He protected you all.
      He has a dark form like a ripe kaḷavam fruit.
      O devotees, why don’t you learn to worship only our unique god’s feet?

2006. At the end of the eon, the whole world was filled with water
      and no one was going to survive.
      He swallowed everyone and kept them in his divine stomach for a long time.
      O devotees, you do not understand that.
      If you understood his power,
      you would praise the thousand names of the generous king of the gods.

2007. At the end of the eon when the large flood
      rose to the sky, he swallowed all the worlds
      and the oceans and protected all.
      O devotees, you praise other new gods.
      Is there anyone who would bathe a wooden board in hot water
      and not bathe their mother who gave birth to them?
      You have no goodness in you.
      If you knew him, you would praise the thousand names
      of our generous lord.

2008. He is our dear lord of Thirukaṇṇamangai
      who protected all, swallowing all the people of the worlds,
      the gods in the sky, the Danavas and all others
      so that the huge flood that came at the end of the eon did not swallow them.
      Any time his devotees do not think of those
      who fail to worship his ankleted feet is sweet for them.

2009. At the end of the eon, the worlds were covered
      with thick darkness and the oceans rose
      in a flood that spread over all the worlds.
      Our god swallowed all the seven golden worlds,
      kept them in his stomach and protected all.
      Any devotees who do not think of the dark shining lord
      are contemptible.

2010. At the end of the eon
      when the waves of the ocean rose and touched the sky,
      he felt pity for his devotees, the gods and the sages,
      gave them his grace and swallowed all the seven worlds
      and kept them in his divine stomach.
      O devotees, sing, dance and praise
      the dark jewel-colored god of cool Kuḍandai who protected you in his stomach.

2011. Kaliyan of Thirumangai surrounded by flourishing groves
      composed a garland of musical pāsurams
      describing how the lord swallowed all the oceans,
      the directions, the Asuras, the gods in the sky and all the worlds
      and how he left no one and nothing without his protection.
      If devotees learn these pāsurams well and recite them,
      they will go to the golden world of the gods,
      receive the grace of Lakshmi on the lotus, and shine.
