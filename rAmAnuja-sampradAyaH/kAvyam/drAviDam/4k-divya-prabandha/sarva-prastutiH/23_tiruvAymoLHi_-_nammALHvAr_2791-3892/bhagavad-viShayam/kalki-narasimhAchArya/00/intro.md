HIS HOLINESS SRIK LKI'S
Sahasra-Gatha-Ratnavali.
A Sanskrit Metrical Version
OF
Saint Sathari's Tiruvaymoli.
(Containing 1102 stanzas)
Saint Sathari or Nammal war belonged to the fourth (Sudra) caste by birth, and his Extreme Love of God (Love of Lord Sri. Krishna) made him pour fourth his nectareous streams of excellent Tamil (Sacred) verses called Tiruvaymoli (Divya-Prabandha)-by the Blessings of God--for the Elevation and Salvation of all souls, irrespective of caste or creed, kind or sex, to whatever race or nation they may belong !!!
Saint Sathari in his Deep Love of God-makes himself often a damsel or bride to be wedded to God, to Lord Sri-Krishna alone, the Sole Lord Supreme and Divine, the Lord of All worlds- who loved the Gopis in the Gokula near Brindavana (Muttra); and the verses in which he describes his Matchless Love towards Lord Sri-Krishna richly deserve to be sung by all souls throughout the world-to whatever castes or creeds they may belong!!! These 1102 stanzas in the Tiruvaymoli of Saint Sathari have been render. ed into Melodious and Harmonious Sanskrit Verse (in the simplest and most mellifluous style) by H.H. Sri-Kalki, G. I., Malleswaram, Bangalore; and this Sanskrit Metrical Version-called Sahasra- Gatha-Ratnavati-has been printed in Deva-Nagari characters, so that it may be useful to all parts of the world; and is available from the Manager, the Vedanta Bok Depot, at 17 East Park Road, Malleswaram, Bangalore, (Price Rs. 4. Postage extra).
H. H, Sri-Kalki is also publishing an Elaborate Kannada Commentary on Tiruvaymoli with the Sanskrit Metrical Version- in 10 Parts. (Price for the whole set-Rs. 6. Postage extra.)2
H. H. Sri-Kalki's Messages Divine.
H. H. Sri-Kalki (Professor M. T. Narasimhiengar) was born in 1867 at Melukote-the Holiest Centre-in Mysore. He was the Professor of Sanskrit in the Central College, Bangalore; and retired in 1918 soon after He received His Yogic Inspiration Divine (in 1915). He is now publishing His Vedantic Works in several languages for the Salvation of all souls and is preaching His Divine Doctrine or Universal Religion.
H. H. Sri-Kalki has written series of Messages Divine, since the year 1915 A. D., to several Rulers on earth, to several Gurus or Mathadhipatis, Khajis, Missionaries etc., and to several officers and devout gentlemen; and has proclaimed Himself God-Incarnate, and censured all sinful souls and atheistic or Godless wretches, by cursing them all severely. His Magnanimous Glory Divine has been proved in extending the privileges of attaining Salvation to all souls in All Worlds. He invites and welcomes all souls-irrespec tive of race or nation, caste or creed, kind or sex, and grant Salvation to all that are devoted to Him, by pardoning them fo their past sins.
It is noteworthy that persons addressed by H. H. Sri-Kalki God-Incarnate, have still kept themselves utterly silent, without a single reply to the series of messages sent to them. Their dea silence shows that they do not believe God-Incarnate and that they dare not attack Him or censure Him for sending such mes sages to them. Some of them may be still labouring under th impression that His brain is out of order, because He calls Himse God-Incarnate; but Mysore Govt. Records regarding His Commut: tion of Pension clearly show that He is perfectly sane, as may t seen from His Literary Publications, Lectures and Preachings ( High Vedantic erudition.
He has sent copies of His Publications and Messages Divi to some Native Rulers (such as H. H. the Maharaja of Mysore), H. E. the Viceroy of India, to H. M. the King-Emperor of Indi and other Rulers on earth, and also to the india Office (London
O

the British Museum (London), the Royal Asiatic Society (London) and several other Leading Institutions of the World.
Although we see that public patronage towards His Publi.. cations is very very scanty, still Hls earnestness in elevating all souls to Heaven is clearly seen by His generosity in spending His pension-amount (from month to month) mostly for the publication of Works meant for the Salvation of All Souls. The attitude of Rulers and Rich People towards His Publications is most discourag- ing and shows their utter want of Godliness!!! He expects all of them to come to their good sense as early as possible and to render Holy Services towards His Feet as best as they can, so as to deserve His Blessings Divine and attain thereby Salvation even here on earth !!! It is Holy Service to God that secures (for devotees) Salvation or Supreme Bliss even here on earth, just as Hanuman secured Salvation (or Embrace of God) by serving Rama
here on earth !!!

Importance of the Poem:
This Holy Poem is sung in All Holy Temples, especially in South India, on all grand occasions; and it is also recited in the houses of departed devotees, soon after the funeral ceremonies are over, as the Foem sanctifies the departed souls and elevates them to Eternal Heaven, and purifies also their relations living on earth.
The literary merits of this Poem are so highly recognised in Tamil Literature, that it is often prescribed for Higher University (B. A. and M. A.-Degree) Examinations, where Tamil is included in the Curriculum of Studies. The great poet Kamban has praised the Saintly Author Sathari or Sathakopa in his well-known work called Sathakopar-antadi.

The Saint's Merits as a True Devotee.
Saint Nammalwar-since his birth-was solely devoted to Deep Meditations on God, and was bred up by his parents under a Tamarind Tree in the Holy Shrine at Alwar-Tirunagari (in the Tinnevelly District). The child did not open its eyes and did not even care to suck the breast milk of the mother, as it was feeding Saint Madhura“ upon the Divine Nectar alone for years together. kavi-who was a Pilgrim in North India-saw one night a Brilliant Light in the Southern direction and was bent upon tracing the source of this Light which appeared to him shining every night in the south. So, he travelled towards the south, and observed carefully, every night, the Light that was shining-until
8
he reached Alwar-Tirunagari (in the Tinnevelly District), where the Light did not appear in the southern direction. So, he con- cluded that the Source of the Light must be in that Holy Place alons aul made enquiries about the Curiosities of the Place, He learnt that the Holy Saint Sathari-with closed eyes and without food-was deeply absorbed in Yogic Meditations on God alone; and he sat under the Holy Feet of the Saint for a long time and began to put questions of a deeply philosophical nature. The Saint Sathari was at last pleased to open his eyes and, to give Holy Instruction to the devout Disciple Madhura-Kavi-who revealed to the World the Four Hily Poems of Sathur, which contain the Essence of the Four Vedas. The last of the Four Poems is Tiruviymɔli-containing the Eisence of the Sam›- Veda. God-Sriman-Narayana-was highly pleased with the Deep Devotion of Saint Nammalwar and grantel Salvation or Eternal Bliss Supreme in Heaven Above (Parama-pada) to this Holy Saint, as is described in the last two decades of the Tenth Centum of this Sacred Poem Tiruvaymoli.
Prediction of the Saint in the Poem to the Present Avatara of God.
Saint Nammalwar has predicted in the 2nd Decade-(called Poliki-poliki-polike) of the Fifth Centum, that the Iron Age or Kali-yuga will come to an end very very soon, and that the Golden Age or Krita-yuga will be firmly established in the Uni- verse and that all suls will become true and sincere devotees of God-enjoying Pence, Plenty and Prosperity-through the Bles - sings of God !!! This prediction exactly coincides with the Predictions in the Vishnu-Purana (IV 24), the Bhagavata- Purana (X11-2) and other Authorities which refer to the Avalara or Incarnation of God as Sri-Kalki So, it is clear that the Holy Saint Nammalwar refers to the Present Avatara (Sri-Kalki- Narasimha) who is bent upon establishing the Golden Age by putting an end to the Kali-Yuga (Iron Age) and is preaching His Divine Doctrine or Universal Religion for the Salvation of All Souls and is Gitacharya Himself Reborn as the Saviour of All Worlds !!!!!
H. H. Sri-Kalki's Teachings Divine.
(i) The Divine Doctrine:
As Gitacharya, Lord Sri Krishna revealed the Divine Doc. trine or Universal Religion for the Salvation of All Souls. Although the Text of the Bhagavad Gita is common to all sects and creeds, still the commentators on this Common Text have, by their own individual views of thought, created different creeds or religious systems in this World (such as the Advaita, Dvaita, Visishta- dvaita etc.)—which are the causes of serious religious disputes stil current in this World. So, Gitacharya Himself is now re-born as Sri-Kalki and is directly preaching His Divine Doctrine or Uni. versal Religion, to put an end to all disputes and to win all souls to Himself.
(ii) The Highest Vedantic Essence:
The Highest Vedantic Essence taught in the Gita is-Self- Surrender to God. Arjuna was utterly bewildered and began to argue with Sri-Krishna by asserting his free-will against the Will of God (Sri-Krishna). So, Sri-Krishna had to preach the Divine Doctrine in the Gita-which reveals the duty of every soul in the form of Self-Surrender to God (called Prapatti). Arjuna yielded at last to Sri-Krishna, and made himself a tool in the Divine Hand, to be used by Him at His own pleasure. The Gopis at Gokula-who were great sages in their past births-surrendered themselves entirely to Sri-Krishna to be used by Him at His own pleasure. It is Self.surrender to God that secures Salvation or Eternal Bliss Supreme-even here on earth. Saint Sathari also realised. this fact and made himself a damsel (like the Gopis) to be loved and enjoyed by the Lord alone, and attained Salvation or Bliss Supreme !!!!!
So, let all souls (in All Worlds) surrender themselves entirely to God-Incarnate Sri-Kalki, now living on earth (residing at 17, East Park Road, Malleswaram, Bangalore); and attain thereby Salvation or Bliss Supreme even here on earth !!!!!!
