## 00 Intro3.3
The Āḻvār prayed to the Lord that his body, the material shackle, which stood in the way of his enjoyment of the Lord, be cut out. But then, the Lord pacified the Āḻvār by pointing out that this body of the Āḻvār in which the Lord eventually got hold of him was by-no-means an impediment, as he thought it to be. On the other hand, He literally coveted him, in that very body, and very much desired to take service from him, in his present embodied state. And so, the Lord beckoned the Āḻvār to serve Him in His Arcā Form at Tiruvēṅkaṭam. Against this background the Āḻvār seeks to render blemishless service unto the Lord at Tiruvēṅkaṭam in ever so many ways, without break, even as a person, feeling the pinch of hunger and with the food packet in hand, sets the table as soon as he comes across a suitable spot with shade and water.




## 3.3.1
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஒழிவு இல் காலம் எல்லாம் உடனாய் மன்னி,  
வழு இலா அடிமை செய்யவேண்டும் நாம்,  
தெழி குரல் அருவித் திருவேங்கடத்து,  
எழில் கொள் சோதி எந்தை தந்தை தந்தைக்கே. (2)

oḻivu il kālam ellām uṭaṉāy maṉṉi,  
vaḻu ilā aṭimai ceyyavēṇṭum nām,  
teḻi kural aruvit tiruvēṅkaṭattu,  
eḻil koḷ cōti entai tantai tantaikkē. (2)

**English translation of verse 3.3.1:**

Serve we shall our Progenitor grand,  
Of splendour galore, in Tiruvēṅkaṭam enshrined,  
Amid roaring cascades, lovely and rapturous,  
With neither break nor blemish, in attendance close.

**Notes**

\(i\) *Serve we shall*: Even the mere contemplation of service is good enough. In Śloka 4 of his ‘Śrivaikuṇṭa Gaḍya’, Śrī Rāmānuja stresses the need for developing, in an ever-increasing measure, the desire for Divine Service.

\(ii\) *The Lord at Tiruvēṅkaṭam, of Splendour galore*

The Lord in Heaven is like unto the lamp burning in broad day light, with its considerably diminished brightness. Further, His stay there is like feeding the fish with water.

The splendour of the Lord reclining on the blue ocean is literally lost on the blue sea itself, there being hardly a few beneficiaries. On the other hand, the Lord at Tiruvēṅkaṭam is like the lamp shining on the hill-top, in all its brilliance, making Him visible even to the most ignorant among us.

\(iii\) *Service at all times*

The Āḻvār pines for service at all times, including the days already gone. It sounds rather queer, if not fantastic, that the Āḻvār should seek service in the

irretrievable past as well. What is emphasised here is service of such a high order aṇd efficiency, which will more than make amends for past lapses, drown the Āḻvār in an ocean of bliss and make him desist from brooding over his past omissions, rather render him oblivious of his dereliction in the past.

\(iv\) *Service without break*

Serving unremittingly the Lord at all places, both inside the Temple and at all places outside where He moves in ceremonial procession. Even when the Lord is screened from public worship by putting a drapery all around, the service should go on, such as tending the lamps, cleaning the vessels meant for containing the sacramental water and so on.

Tiruvaraṅkapperumāḷ Araiyar who recited this song before Lord Raṅganātha, in that grand assemblage in the temple at Śrīraṅgam, is said to have gone into a trance, while reciting the first line of this song, as in the original text, and he went on repeating, “at all times”. Evidently, he had got into the mood of the Āḻvār himself, whose passion for Divine Service was so great.

Service without break would also signify service, one after the other, with the same avidity with which Lakṣmaṇa served the Divine Couple, Śrī Rāma and Sītā, during exile. It would also connote selfless service, absolutely free from any tinge of egoism and sense of self-enjoyment, that is, service motivated by the individual soul’s own sense of delight and enjoyment, as against service rendered solely for the Lord’s delectation.

When Śrī Rāmānuja discoursed on this song, he enquired which of his listeners, in that vast assembly, would like to go to Tiruvēṅkaṭam and render unto the Lord service, as envisaged by the Āḻvār. There was but a solitary response from one Aṉantāḻvāṉ who volunteered his services and sought Śrī Rāmānuja’s blessings for the proper fulfilment of the sacred mission. All the others seemed to have got scared of the climatic condition of Tirumalai Hills, frightfully chill, with an unbroken succession of rains. Śrī Rāmānuja embraced Aṉantāḻvāṉ endearingly and exclaimed that he was the one and only male (Āṇpiḷḷai, in Tamil) in that assembly, who was really bold, ready to brave the climate of Tiruvēṅkaṭam. Thence forward, he came to be known as Aṉāntaṉpiḷḷai. He went and served at Tiruvēṅ-kaṭam, to the immense delectation of Lord Śrīnivāsa.




## 3.3.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

எந்தை தந்தை தந்தை தந்தை தந்தைக்கும்  
முந்தை, வானவர் வானவர் கோனொடும்,  
சிந்து பூ மகிழும் திருவேங்கடத்து,  
அந்தம் இல் புகழ்க் கார் எழில் அண்ணலே.

entai tantai tantai tantai tantaikkum  
muntai, vāṉavar vāṉavar kōṉoṭum,  
cintu pū makiḻum tiruvēṅkaṭattu,  
antam il pukaḻk kār eḻil aṇṇalē.

**English translation of verse 3.3.2:**

Of endless glory and exquisite bluish hue,  
Our great progenitor first and foremost, dwells in Tiruvēṅkaṭam,  
Strewn with crimson flowers of unfailing hue,  
Attended by the celestials from heaven and their chieftain.

**Notes**

\(i\) To a query why he is rendering service unto the Lord at Tiruvēṅkaṭam when the final goal is service of the Lord in Heaven, the Āḻvār replies that even the Celestials headed by Śrī Śēṉāpati Āḻvār (Cēṉaimutaliyār) come down, in their strength, to serve the Lord at Tiruvēṅkaṭam. That is because of the twin aspects of the Lord, namely, supremacy (Paratva) and simplicity (Saulabhya). The latter can be enjoyed only in Tiruvēṅkaṭam and hence, the Celestials come down here to enjoy that which cannot be experienced in Heaven. Even so, they get swept off their feet by the Lord’s amazing simplicity and the garlands, set with colourful flowers, brought by them to be offered to the Lord, drop from their hands unawares but these flowers of Celestial origin do not fade at all.

\(ii\) *Limitless glory*

The glory of the Lord, comprehended iṇ Heaven by ṭhe denizens of the Eternal Land, would seem to be circumscribed, in as much as the ‘Nityās’ (ever-free angels) and Mukṭās’ (released souls) inhabiting that region, endowed with the transcendent forms are well equipped to partake of all that bliss, emanating from the Lord. On the other hand, in this abode of ours, the Lord is revealing Himself in His Arcā (iconic) form to all and sundry, including wild beasts. His glory in this hallowed land is limitless indeed.




## 3.3.3
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அண்ணல் மாயன் அணி கொள் செந்தாமரைக்  
கண்ணன் செங்கனி, வாய்க் கருமாணிக்கம்,  
தெள் நிறை சுனை நீர்த், திருவேங்கடத்து,  
எண் இல் தொல் புகழ் வானவர் ஈசனே.

aṇṇal māyaṉ aṇi koḷ centāmaraik  
kaṇṇaṉ ceṅkaṉi, vāyk karumāṇikkam,  
teḷ niṟai cuṉai nīrt, tiruvēṅkaṭattu,  
eṇ il tol pukaḻ vāṉavar īcaṉē.

**English translation of verse 3.3.3:**

Our wondrous sire at Tiruvēṅkaṭam,  
Holding water fed from cascades, pure and plenty,  
Shines like the lustrous blue gem,  
With lotus eyes and lips, red and radiant, of rare beauty;  
Of countless qualities, auspicious and abiding,  
He, His sway over the Celestials, is holding.

**Notes**

\(i\) Questioned whether the Āḻvār would be able to put through the service unto the Lord at Tiruvēṅkaṭam, as contemplated, the Āḻvār says, with an air of assurance that the Lord is the Supreme Benefactor, making it possible for the Celestials and other numerous highly evolved souls to drink deep of His nectarean beauty in Mount Tiruvēṅkaṭam and He would certainly not deny this benefit to the Āḻvār. Otherwise, how can He live up to His glory as the possessor of innumerable auspicious traits, ever present in Him?

\(ii\) *Of wondrous beauty*

The radiant eyes, red like lotus flower, staṇd out foremost and what else is required to beautify Him? The Lord sheds His grace through His eyes and it is but proper that the eyes are mentioned first and next in order, the lips from which He utters words, full of affection for His devotees. Again, it is the bewitching smile on these coral lips, that attracts one and all to Him.




## 3.3.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஈசன் வானவர்க்கு என்பன் என்றால், அது  
தேசமோ திருவேங்கடத்தானுக்கு?,  
நீசனேன் நிறைவு ஒன்றும் இலேன், என்கண்  
பாசம் வைத்த பரம் சுடர்ச் சோதிக்கே.

īcaṉ vāṉavarkku eṉpaṉ eṉṟāl, atu  
tēcamō tiruvēṅkaṭattāṉukku?,  
nīcaṉēṉ niṟaivu oṉṟum ilēṉ, eṉkaṇ  
pācam vaitta param cuṭarc cōtikkē.

**English translation of verse 3.3.4:**

Would it at all redound to His great glory  
Were I to call, as (mere) Lord of Heaven, Him  
That shines in all splendour at Tiruvēṅkaṭam,  
And fondles me, the lowliest of the lowly?

**Note**

ḷn the preceding song, the Lord was referred to as the Chief of the Celestials, granting audience to them at Tiruvēṅkaṭam. And now, the Āḻvār feels that it would be a gross understatement of His real greatness which lies in the condescending grace with which He mixes with the monkeys and hunters in Tirumalai Hills and what is even more, the profusion of love extended to one, as low as the Āḻvār. This self-abnegation assuming the lowest depths of humility (c.f. Aḷavantār’s self—denunciation in śloka 62 of Stotra-Ratna) only heightens the glory of the Lord. As a matter of fact, if He were merely the Lord of the Celestials in Heaven, His glory stands circumscribed, that is, confined to that region alone. It is only here, against the background of the darkness and nescience we present, that His glory can shine in all its splendour. Not by His might and majesty, surrounded by the Angels in Heaven and unapproachable to us, is He great but by His loving grace and great concern for us, deep down here, sunk in sorrow. Thus and thus alone can He be God indeed.




## 3.3.5
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

சோதி ஆகி எல்லா உலகும் தொழும்,  
ஆதிமூர்த்தி என்றால் அளவு ஆகுமோ?,  
வேதியர் முழு வேதத்து அமுதத்தை,  
தீது இல் சீர்த் திருவேங்கடத்தானையே.

cōti āki ellā ulakum toḻum,  
ātimūrtti eṉṟāl aḷavu ākumō?,  
vētiyar muḻu vētattu amutattai,  
tītu il cīrt tiruvēṅkaṭattāṉaiyē.

**English translation of verse 3.3.5:**

How dare I circumscribe the glory  
Of the immaculate Lord at Tiruvēṅkaṭam,  
Venerated by all the worlds, resplendent and hoary,  
Nectarean essence of all Vedic texts, chanted by scholars of great fame?

**Notes**

\(i\) *The Lord, venerated by all the worlds*

The Āḻvār says that he cannot circumscribe the glory of the Lord by telling that He is venerated by all the worlds. As a matter of fact, he has not said so earlier. But it is implied by the fact that even he, the lowliest of the lowly, worships Him. When it is said that the bottom-most boy in the class has got through the examination, does it not follow that all the others above him have passed? When the swollen waters of the river have submerged the topmost foot-step, it goes without saying that all the steps below have also been submerged.

\(ii\) *The Immaculate Lord*

The Lord is the repository of all auspicious qualities and is blemishless. He could be free from blemishes only when He makes Himself accessible to the lowliest of the lowly. In His search for one such, He couldn’t get at any one worse than Āḻvār unto whom He has extended His grace despite all his drawbacks. And now, He keeps standing at Tiruvēṅkaṭam, ever on the look-out for one even more heinous than the Āḻvār, to shed His grace upon. It is this greatness of the Lord that the Āḻvār extols in this Song with characteristic humility.




## 3.3.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வேம் கடங்கள் மெய்மேல் வினை முற்றவும்,  
தாங்கள் தங்கட்கு நல்லனவே செய்வார்,  
வேங்கடத்து உறைவார்க்கு நம என்னல்-  
ஆம் கடமை, அது சுமந்தார்கட்கே.

vēm kaṭaṅkaḷ meymēl viṉai muṟṟavum,  
tāṅkaḷ taṅkaṭku nallaṉavē ceyvār,  
vēṅkaṭattu uṟaivārkku nama eṉṉal-  
ām kaṭamai, atu cumantārkaṭkē.

**English translation of verse 3.3.6:**

Inclination for selfless service into Vēṅkaṭattuṟaivār (He that dwells in Vēṅkaṭam),  
Shall our past sins burn down as well as those yet to come;  
(With the dawn of favour thus conferred)  
The devout shall in such wholesome service persevere.

**Notes**

\(i\) This song is the sequel to the first song of this decad where mention was made of rendering every kind of service to the Lord at Tiruvēṅkaṭam, without break or blemish. Asked how it would at all be possible to render such service, when the sins operate as serious impediments, the Āḻvār clarifies that the mere contemplation of service unto the Lord will root out all sins committed so far as well as those likely to rear up their ugly heads in the days to come, by reason of our material contacts and ensure unremitting service, in a wholesome spirit. But then, it might be asked how the accumulated heaps of sins of ages could be destroyed by a simple gesture, as above. Śrī Bhaṭṭārya set at naught this doubt through the following illustration:

Śrī Rāma sought the help of the king of the ocean to bund the sea and cross over to Laṅkā, lying prostrate in front of the ocean, for full three days, with due austerity. When the king of the ocean failed to present himself, Śrī Rāma got enraged and was about to drive a shaft into the bosom of the ocean, threatening to dry it up. Struck with terror, the king of the ocean appeared instantly and made his obeisance. The king of the ocean having thus capituaḻated and come to terms, Śrī Rāma was pacified. He not only generously pardoned the king but made the extraordinary gesture of asking him to indicate where his enemies were, so that the bow lifted against him could vent its fury on his enemies. Śrī Rāma’s bow was never lifted in vain, and the arrow sped in the direction of the target, pointed out by the king of the ocean, to vanquish his enemies.

In ‘Viṣṇu Sahasranāma’, there are, *inter alia*, two names of the Lord, viz., ‘Stavya [*stavyaḥ*]’ and ‘Stavapriya [*stavapriyaḥ*]’. The first means that the Lord is praiseworthy and each one of His several attributes would faithfully depict the Lord. ‘Stavapriyaḥ’ means one, who is pleased with the praise showered on Him, in any form or language, correctly worded or not. And so, with all our limitations, even the feeble praise from our feeble tongues endears us to the Lord, Who overlooks all our faults and sins and regards us, in an ample measure.

\(ii\) Would it be necessary to do hard labour to get rid of our Sins? Not at all; all that is needed is loving service, rendered disinterestedly, befitting one’s station in life and conforming to one’s essential nature (svarūpa). Even the simple word ‘namaḥ’ (I don’t belong to myself but to you), uttered by the devotee, is deemed by the over-generous Lord as very weighty indeed and He cuts out all the sins of the devotee and puts him on the path of unremitting Divine Service.




## 3.3.7
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

சுமந்து மாமலர் நீர் சுடர் தூபம் கொண்டு,  
அமர்ந்து வானவர் வானவர் கோனொடும்,  
நமன்று எழும் திருவேங்கடம் நங்கட்குச்,  
சமன் கொள் வீடு தரும் தடங் குன்றமே.

cumantu māmalar nīr cuṭar tūpam koṇṭu,  
amarntu vāṉavar vāṉavar kōṉoṭum,  
namaṉṟu eḻum tiruvēṅkaṭam naṅkaṭkuc,  
camaṉ koḷ vīṭu tarum taṭaṅ kuṉṟamē.

**English translation of verse 3.3.7:**

By itself, Tiruvēṅkaṭam, that august mountain  
Where do repair the Celestials with their chieftain  
And worship with choice flowers, water, lamp and incense,  
Shall unto us grant the blissful emancipation (the etemal service).

**Notes**

\(i\) “For securing the uninterrupted service in the Eternal Lar d we pine for, the good offices of the holy mountain, Tiruvēṅkaṭam, will do. It would be hardly necessary for us to propitiate Lord Śrīnivāsa (enshrined there), in this behalf” says the Āḻvār.

\(ii\) The adjective ‘Choice’, in the third line, qualifies not only the flowers but also water and incense, meaning the best of each kind. The excellence of the material' offered, however, lies not in its physical quality but in the devotion with which it is offered. Did not the Lord say, in Bhagavad Gītā (9-27), as follows?

“Whosoever shall offer Me, in faith and love, a leaf, a flower, a fruit, water poured forth, that offering, lovingly made with pious will, I do accept”.

The following illustration will drive home this point.

On one occasion, some princes had a desire to offer Lord Jagannātha at Pūri (in Orissa), Campaka flowers, said to be His favourite. Going to the flower-market, they found that the flowers had been sold out and there was but a solitary flower left. This gave rise to keen competition among the princes and they went on bidding till one of them staked his entire fortune and bought the flower. The flower was offered by the Prince to the Lord who appeared in his dream that night and exclaimed that the debt of his flower was indeed too heavy for Him, thereby signifying His gracious acceptance of the sincerely made offering, which was even beyond His capacity to repay!

\(iii\) The term ‘Celestials’ has been used comprehensively so as to include besides the Nityasūris, (the ever-free angels in heaven), Brahmā and other Devas. Although Brahmā and other Devas do not serve the Lord disinterestedly but always seek favours from Him for their own selfish ends, yet, the Āḻvār is charitable enough and invests them with his own bent of mind, painting them also as selfless, like him.




## 3.3.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

குன்றம் ஏந்திக் குளிர் மழை காத்தவன்,  
அன்று ஞாலம் அளந்த பிரான், பரன்  
சென்று சேர் திருவேங்கட மா மலை,  
ஒன்றுமே தொழ நம் வினை ஓயுமே. (2)

kuṉṟam ēntik kuḷir maḻai kāttavaṉ,  
aṉṟu ñālam aḷanta pirāṉ, paraṉ  
ceṉṟu cēr tiruvēṅkaṭa mā malai,  
oṉṟumē toḻa nam viṉai ōyumē. (2)

**English translation of verse 3.3.8:**

Worship we shall Tiruvēṅkaṭam, the halo’d mountain,  
Favourite resort of the Benefactor great, who repelled the chill rains,  
Holding mount (Govardhana) aloft and who the worlds did once span;  
That’s enough to extricate us from all our sins.

**Note**

Here again, the over-riding importance of the Sacred Mount vis-a-vis the Lord enshrined there, is emphasised. Mount Tiruvēṅkaṭam thus becomes the goal or destination of the Lord and His devotees alike. If it was Mount Govardhana during the Lord’s incarnation as Śrī Kṛṣṇa that shielded the subjects of Gokula it is now Mount Tiruvēṅkaṭam that operates as the Saviour, during His Arcā (Iconic) manifestation.




## 3.3.9
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஓயும் மூப்புப் பிறப்பு இறப்பு:பிணி,  
வீயுமாறு செய்வான் திருவேங்கடத்து  
ஆயன், நாள் மலர் ஆம் அடித்தாமரை,  
வாயுள்ளும்மனத்துள்ளும் வைப்பார்கட்கே.

ōyum mūppup piṟappu iṟappu:piṇi,  
vīyumāṟu ceyvāṉ tiruvēṅkaṭattu  
āyaṉ, nāḷ malar ām aṭittāmarai,  
vāyuḷḷummaṉattuḷḷum vaippārkaṭkē.

**English translation of verse 3.3.9:**

The shepherd (Kṛṣṇa) who dwells in Tiruvēṅkaṭam,  
Rids those, who meditate and sing the praise  
Of His Comely feet, dainty as lotus, in fresh bloom,  
Of fatiguing old age, birth, death and pestilence.

**Notes**

\(i\) In the preceding song, Mount Tiruvēṅkaṭam was said to deliver the goods. And now, it is said that even a part of it, namely, Lord Śrīnivāsa, will do the job. Cf. Tirumaṅkai Āḻvār’s reference to Lord Śrinivāsa,. in Periya Tirumoḷi,........................, as the crest of the northern hill (Vaṭa māmalai ucci).

\(ii\) The Lord enshrined in Tiruvēṅkaṭam derives importance from His association with the Sacred Mount (Tirumalai) and hence the latter is our destined goal (Āṟāyirappaṭi).




## 3.3.10
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வைத்த நாள் வரை எல்லை குறுகிச் சென்று,  
எய்த்து இளைப்பதன் முன்னம் அடைமினோ,  
பைத்த பாம்பு அணையான் திருவேங்கடம்,  
மொய்த்த சோலை மொய்பூந்தடந் தாழ்வரே.

vaitta nāḷ varai ellai kuṟukic ceṉṟu,  
eyttu iḷaippataṉ muṉṉam aṭaimiṉō,  
paitta pāmpu aṇaiyāṉ tiruvēṅkaṭam,  
moytta cōlai moypūntaṭan tāḻvarē.

**English translation of verse 3.3.10:**

Better reach the sacred precincts of Tiruvēṅkaṭam.  
With orchards many and a cluster of tanks,  
Where stays the Lord whose bed is the serpent,  
With outstretched hoods, ere your life’s quantum  
Draws to a close and your health badly shrinks.

**Notes**

\(i\) The Āḻvār exhorts us to take to the enchanting Tiruvēṅkaṭam, as the final goal. The All-Merciful Lord has indeed dowered on us life and limbs to help us move about and worship the Lord in His Iconic manifestation, in the various pilgrim centres like Tiruvēṅkaṭam and render unto Him every possible service. But, alas! we dissipate our lives and energies, in several ungodly pursuits, till, one day, old age and the attendant infirmity overtake us unawares and badly impair our mobility.

\(ii\) This song also stresses the grandeur of Tiruvēṅkaṭam which has attracted the Lord despite His having Ādiśeṣa, the posh bed, highly delectable. Again, from the point of view of the devotees, it is equally attractive and if only they would care to go there ere old age catches them in its unrelenting grip, they could render service unto the Lord with great ease, absolutely free from fatigue, in that exhilarating environment.




## 3.3.11
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

தாள் பரப்பி மண் தாவிய ஈசனை,  
நீள் பொழில் குருகூர்ச் சடகோபன் சொல்,  
கேழ் இல் ஆயிரத்து இப் பத்தும் வல்லவர்  
வாழ்வர் வாழ்வு எய்தி ஞாலம் புகழவே. (2)

tāḷ parappi maṇ tāviya īcaṉai,  
nīḷ poḻil kurukūrc caṭakōpaṉ col,  
kēḻ il āyirattu ip pattum vallavar  
vāḻvar vāḻvu eyti ñālam pukaḻavē. (2)

**English translation of verse 3.3.11:**

Those that recite these songs ten of peerless excellence,  
Out of the thousand sung by Caṭakōpaṉ of lovely Kurukūr,  
Adoring Īcaṉ (Lord), who spanned the universe, shall acquire  
World-wide fame and (everlasting) opulence.

**Notes**

\(i\) This decad sings the glory of the Lord at Tiruvēṅkaṭam and yet, it has been made out, in this end-stanza, that the decad extols the greatness of the Lord, Who, in His incarnate form as Trivikrama, spanned the entire universe. Our great Ācāryas hold that there is perfect identity between these two forms of the Lord. The Lord keeps standing at Tiruvēṅkaṭam to secure all His subjects under His patronising feet and so did Trivikrama, setting His feet on all and sundry, without distinction of high and low, rich and poor, Saint and debauchee. The Lord at Tiruvēṅkaṭam is also quite at home with the hunters and monkeys.

\(ii\) *Everlasting opulence*: This denotes the eternal service in Heaven, both body and mind being lovingly attuned to it.
