## 00 Intro7.9
It was indeed the Lord’s ingenuity that was in full evidence in the last decad, whereby He could gain time and divert the attention of the Āḻvār, astounded by the bewildering net-work of His superb wonders. In fact, we have seen this kind of happening all along, the appeasement of the Āḻvār at every turn by the Lord, exhibiting one or the other of His special traits and prolonging his stay in this abode. But now, the Āḻvār is determined to clinch the issue and demand of the Lord, what precisely makes Him resort to such tantalising tactics, without responding to the request made by him far back, in the opening song of his very first hymnal (Tiruviruttam) that he should be lifted from this foul body, full of dirt and devilry. Was there anything wanting in regard to his yearning or did the Lord’s capacity to salve him decline? No, neither this nor that. But then, why should the Lord extend his stay in this cussed land with its sordid surroundings? Well, this is precisely the Āḻvār’s query unto the Supreme Lord, to which the Lord’s answer is “Āḻvār! You jolly well know my intention and yet speak as if you are ignorant. Well, I have kept you in this abode to get from you the soul-stirring hymns of unparalleled sweetness for the edification and enjoyment of Myself and My devotees even as I kept the wise Bhīsma in the specially erected bed of arrows for quite some length of tune and enriched the world through the dissemination of knowledge by that great Savant”. The Āḻvār feels overawed by the Lord’s tender solicitude and extraordinary love for him and exclaims: “My Lord, You are known to be above all wants and it is indeed very strange that you too should be suffering from a want like this. Even assuming that you have one such desire, You could have easily got it fulfilled by sages Vālmīki, Vyāsa, Parāśara and others of that eminent order or by the first three Āḻvārs, the divine bards, *par excellence*. It is indeed amazing that You should have chosen me, the lowliest of the lowly, absolutely ill-equipped, for this great assignment. This is indeed the limit of Your loving condescension.”

And so, in this decad, the Āḻvār gratefully acknowledges the Lord’s great gesture, perplexed a good deal, at the same time, over his own inability to recompense Him.




## 7.9.1
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

என்றைக்கும் என்னை உய்யக்கொண்டு போகிய,  
அன்றைக்கு அன்று என்னைத் தன்னாக்கி என்னால் தன்னை,  
இன் தமிழ் பாடிய ஈசனை ஆதியாய்-  
நின்ற என் சோதியை, என் சொல்லி நிற்பனோ? (2)

eṉṟaikkum eṉṉai uyyakkoṇṭu pōkiya,  
aṉṟaikku aṉṟu eṉṉait taṉṉākki eṉṉāl taṉṉai,  
iṉ tamiḻ pāṭiya īcaṉai ātiyāy-  
niṉṟa eṉ cōtiyai, eṉ colli niṟpaṉō? (2)

**English translation of verse 7.9.1:**

Strayed I from the Lord for long and yet He did admit  
Me unto His fold firm and blest me in ample measure,  
Knowledge, strength and all He did on me shower,  
Putting me with Him on a par and by His charm exquisite  
Inspired me and brought out this hymnal sweet  
How can I His grace galore express indeed?

**Notes:**

The Saint thaws down in gratitude over the Lord’s enormous grace in getting hymnals sung through him, duly equipping him for this assignment. Indeed, the outpourings of Saints are all inspired by God and therefore it is that the Āḻvār does not claim authorship for the hymnal, sung by the Lord through him as His mouth-piece. This hymnal is claimed to be sweet because the authorship vests in the Lord. Otherwise, it ill-becomes a poet to glorify his own poems. As Nampiḷḷai would put it the liberated soul, that goes to Heaven, sings there the Sāma Veda in sheer joy. Likewise, the Alvar gives vent to his joy by singing ‘Tiruvāymoḻi’ and the Lord, attracted by it, participates in the singing Himself and elaborates. It is just like the teacher holding the finger of the young pupil and writing; the little lad pushes the pencil in one direction and the teacher corrects it and makes good the lapses of the young chap. And again, the Lord set aside the mantle and revealed His exquisite Form to the Āḻvār who stood enthralled by it and shouted with Joy, which, in turn, took the form of this hymnal.




## 7.9.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

என்சொல்லி நிற்பன் என் இன் உயிர் இன்று ஒன்றாய்,  
என்சொல்லால் யான்சொன்ன இன்கவி என்பித்து,  
தன்சொல்லால் தான்தன்னைக் கீர்த்தித்த மாயன், என்  
முன்சொல்லும் மூவுருவாம் முதல்வனே.

eṉcolli niṟpaṉ eṉ iṉ uyir iṉṟu oṉṟāy,  
eṉcollāl yāṉcoṉṉa iṉkavi eṉpittu,  
taṉcollāl tāṉtaṉṉaik kīrttitta māyaṉ, eṉ  
muṉcollum mūvuruvām mutalvaṉē.

**English translation of verse 7.9.2:**

How shall I my gratitude express unto the Primate,  
Who as Trinity functions and Who would from within me dictate  
And sing His glory in words, this mean vassal would repeat,  
Bring out this hymnal and, as its author, make me out?

**Notes:**

The Āḻvār is indeed at a loss to find words to express the boundless grace of the Lord, who weaned him away from his waywardness and chose him as His mouthpiece to repeat the words dictated by Him and then glorified him as the great author of this grand hymnal. This is just like His discharging the cosmic functions through Brahmā, Rudra, Indra and the whole hierarchy, standing within them all as their Internal Controller. The Āḻvār, it will thus be seen, doos not own authorship of the hymnals sung by him and makes it out as the Lord’s own utterances through the medium of His beloved Saints. Even as the minor deities are made by Him to appear as Creator of the worlds, Destroyer of Tripura the (three flying citadels) and so on, in respect of acts actually performed by the Lord as their Internal Controller, He makes it appear that the Āḻvār is the author of this hymnal. Had the Lord uttered this hymnal directly, it would be just another piece like His Gitā and be far from the juicy thing it is, extremely delectable, coming as it does from the month of the Saint. Apart from the fact that the Lord attaches more importance to the utterances of His devotees than to His own, Nampi Tiruvaḻuti Nāṭu Tācar would illustrate the relative importance of the utterances of the Lord and the Āḻvār and their impact on an assembly of learned men, as follows: When a person, reciting Ślokas from Bhagavad Gītā went there a-begging, they just dismissed him with a handful of rice, without allowing him a place in their midst. On the other hand, when an itinerant came across, warbling the sweet songs of Tiruvāymoḻi, the whole town and the Deity enshrined there, as well, rose to greet him, escorted him to places assigned by them with competitive exuberance and treated him with the utmost respect and hospitality.




## 7.9.3
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஆம் முதல்வன் இவன் என்று தன் தேற்றி, என்  
நா முதல் வந்து புகுந்து நல் இன் கவி,  
தூ முதல் பத்தர்க்குத் தான் தன்னைச் சொன்ன, என்  
வாய் முதல் அப்பனை என்று மறப்பனோ?

ām mutalvaṉ ivaṉ eṉṟu taṉ tēṟṟi, eṉ  
nā mutal vantu pukuntu nal iṉ kavi,  
tū mutal pattarkkut tāṉ taṉṉaic coṉṉa, eṉ  
vāy mutal appaṉai eṉṟu maṟappaṉō?

**English translation of verse 7.9.3:**

Shall I ever forget my Lord Who desired, I would better  
Become Chief of Prapannas’ clan and on me clarity bestowed,  
Entered my tongue to sing songs delicious which unto the pious cater,  
The Benefactor great, Who unto me the gift of speech endowed?

**Notes:**

\(i\) The Āḻvār gratefully acknowledges the Lord’s assignment to him of the role of redeeming the worldlings, sunk in sorrow and despair, by instilling in him, as a preparatory measure, clarity of knowledge and understanding that He is the Supreme Lord of the Universe, the Sole Refuge of all His subjects. Bent upon redeeming the subjects in the ‘Līlā Vibhūti’ (Sportive Universe) and bringing them on a par with the denizens of Heaven, the Lord inspires His chosen few, His messengers. Tradition has it that, during his sojourn at Śrī Kāñci, the great Āḷavandār (Saint Yāmunācārya) spotted out, by mere insight, young Rāmānuja, seen in the company of Yādavaprakāśa, at the holy shrine of Lord Varadarāja, as the great religious reformer, the Chief Personage, who would, in the coming days, spread the gospel of Viśiṣṭādvaita actually known as ‘Emperumāṉār Darśana’. Āḷavandār had no acquaintance with Rāmānuja nor did the latter know the former.

\(ii\) In the very manner of its birth, this hymnal (Tiruvāymoḻi) scores over Rāmāyaṇa. While the Lord stepped on to the Āḻvār’s tongue and straightaway produced this great hymnal, Rāmāyaṇa had to pass through a number of intermediaries in succession, namely, Lord to Brahmā Brahmā to Sarasvatī and from her to Vālmīki, in the sense that she entered Vālmīki’s tongue to enable the latter to sing the great epic.




## 7.9.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அப்பனை என்று மறப்பன் என் ஆகியே,  
தப்புதல் இன்றி தனைக் கவி தான் சொல்லி,  
ஒப்பிலாத் தீவினையேனை உய்யக்கொண்டு  
செப்பமே செய்து திரிகின்ற சீர்கண்டே?

appaṉai eṉṟu maṟappaṉ eṉ ākiyē,  
tapputal iṉṟi taṉaik kavi tāṉ colli,  
oppilāt tīviṉaiyēṉai uyyakkoṇṭu  
ceppamē ceytu tirikiṉṟa cīrkaṇṭē?

**English translation of verse 7.9.4:**

How can I, at anytime, forget my Benefactor great,  
Seeing His great love unto me, the sinner great,  
Redeeming me, tending me all along and singing His glory great  
Thro’ me, taking care to see no blemish creeps in, at that?

**Notes:**

\(i\) It is not a matter for any wonder if the Lord sang poems of His great glory Himself. But the real wonder is, He chose Caṭakōpaṉ, ill-equipped for hymning, to sing the songs and ensured, at the same time, their perfe-ectin [perfection?], eliminating the risk of contamination through his association. “It is because of His omniscience and omnipotence that He could achieve this through me” says the Āḻvār, “notwithstanding my absolute incompetence and my sins galore, involving a good deal of reclamation”.

\(ii\) Empār would reinforce the purport of this song, by saying: “when the Lord preaches directly, as He did, in His Song Celestial (Bhagavad Gītā), such gospel is indeed absolutely free from blemishes. On the other hand, when our human ingenuity is called into play, in bringing out laudatory hymns, it is laboured out, bearing the mark of our limitations. But when God chooses us as His select instrument for the propagation of His message to the world at large, He Himself speaks, untainted by the imperfections of His medium. As a matter of fact, He rids the medium of all imperfections and it is this that the Āḻvār gratefully acknowledges in this song”.

[c.f. Milton’s exclamation in his swan-song:—“Give me now my lyre, I feel the stirrings of a gift divine, within my bosom blows unearthly fire, Lit by no skill of mine”.]




## 7.9.5
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

சீர் கண்டுகொண்டு திருந்து நல் இன்கவி,  
நேர்பட யான் சொல்லும் நீர்மை இலாமையில்,  
ஏர்வு இலா என்னைத் தன்னாக்கி என்னால் தன்னைப்,  
பார் பரவு இன்கவி பாடும் பரமரே.

cīr kaṇṭukoṇṭu tiruntu nal iṉkavi,  
nērpaṭa yāṉ collum nīrmai ilāmaiyil,  
ērvu ilā eṉṉait taṉṉākki eṉṉāl taṉṉaip,  
pār paravu iṉkavi pāṭum paramarē.

**English translation of verse 7.9.5:**

The Lord Supreme blest me, least competent to hymn,  
Thro’ songs, sweet and pure, deeply absorbed in Him,  
And the medium effective made of me, with Him on a par  
To sing and spread His glory throughout the land, near and far.

**Note**

The Āḻvār says that he was not qualified to compose poems, as he did not have any poetic talent worth the name, and even assuming that he could compose poemṣ, he was hardly eligible to sing the Lord’s glory, as he didn’t know a wee wit of His greatness and grandeur. But what has the Lord done? He has instilled in the Āḻvār the requisite knowledge and qualities and elevated him on a par with Him. The Lord sings through the Āḻvār and yet looks upon him as the Poet, *par excellence*. The Saint acknowledges this great gesture of the Lord Whose magnanimity knows no bounds, with melting tenderness of heart. Indeed, no further evidence is needed to establish the Lord’s greatness.




## 7.9.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

இன் கவி பாடும் பரம் கவிகளால்,  
தன் கவி தான் தன்னைப் பாடுவியாது இன்று  
நன்கு வந்து என்னுடன் ஆக்கி என்னால் தன்னை,  
வன் கவி பாடும் என் வைகுந்த நாதனே.

iṉ kavi pāṭum param kavikaḷāl,  
taṉ kavi tāṉ taṉṉaip pāṭuviyātu iṉṟu  
naṉku vantu eṉṉuṭaṉ ākki eṉṉāl taṉṉai,  
vaṉ kavi pāṭum eṉ vaikunta nātaṉē.

**English translation of verse 7.9.6:**

Oh, how gracious it is of the Lord of celestials  
To choose me as His instrument and shed on me His grace  
To get His glory by me sung although He could very well  
Press (the first three Āḻvārs), the sweet-singing poets supreme, into service!

**Note**

There have indeed been many sweet-singing poets combining poetic skill and piety, like Vyāsa, Parāśara and Vālmīki, the great Sanskrit poets and the first three Āḻvārs and ‘Tirumaḷicai Āḻvār’ who have many sweet, soul-stirring hymns in Tamil to their credit. The Lord could have got the ‘Tiruvāymoḻi’ also sung by these super-eminent poets and yet He deigned to shed His special grace on Nammāḻvār who came long after, and got these songs of His choice mouthed by him. The Lord revealed unto the Āḻvār His grandeur as the Lord of Heavens so that the latter could sing His glory. It was only when He heard His praise sung by the Āḻvār, He could feel His position as the Heavenly Lord, stable. Actually, the Heaven is the eternal land of unquestionable stability, well beyond the mischief of the deluge, when all the other worlds enter the Lord’s stomach for sheer survival. And yet, the Lord is inclined to treat His transcendent glory in Heaven, on a par with the fame attained by Him through the Āḻvār’s laudation.




## 7.9.7
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வைகுந்த நாதன் என வல்வினை மாய்ந்து அறச்,  
செய் குந்தன் தன்னை என் ஆக்கி என்னால் தன்னை,  
வைகுந்தன் ஆகப் புகழ வண் தீம்கவி,  
செய் குந்தன் தன்னை எந்நாள் சிந்தித்து ஆர்வனோ!

vaikunta nātaṉ eṉa valviṉai māyntu aṟac,  
cey kuntaṉ taṉṉai eṉ ākki eṉṉāl taṉṉai,  
vaikuntaṉ ākap pukaḻa vaṇ tīmkavi,  
cey kuntaṉ taṉṉai ennāḷ cintittu ārvaṉō!

**English translation of verse 7.9.7:**

My heart’s fill I never can have, however long I muse  
Over my beneficent Lord who did enthuse  
Me to sing songs, sweet beyond compare, of His glory  
As the heavenly Lord, cleansing me of my sins gory  
And putting me on a par with Him, mingling freely.

**Notes:**

The Lord of the Universe, Chief of the exalted Celestials has condescended to shed His limitless grace on a great sinner, and cleanse him throughly, making him pure like Him. And what more? The regenerated Āḻvār, of immaculate purity, is made by Him to sing His heavenly glory and grandeur to His great delectation. It is indeed amazing that the Lord should feel that He flourishes only as a result of the Āḻvār’s laudation; this is akin to a father, who gifted away a cow to his son, getting back the same cow as the latter’s gift. So great is the Lord’s loving condescension that the Āḻvār can’t but muse over it endlessly. Even so, he cannot do adequate justice, seeing that the span of life is much-too-short while the magnitude of the favours heaped on him by the Lord is much-too-large.




## 7.9.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஆர்வனோ ஆழிஅங்கை எம் பிரான் புகழ்,  
பார் விண் நீர் முற்றும் கலந்து பருகிலும்,  
ஏர்வு இலா என்னைத் தன்னாக்கி என்னால் தன்னைச்,  
சீர்பெற இன்கவி சொன்ன திறத்துக்கே?

ārvaṉō āḻiaṅkai em pirāṉ pukaḻ,  
pār viṇ nīr muṟṟum kalantu parukilum,  
ērvu ilā eṉṉait taṉṉākki eṉṉāl taṉṉaic,  
cīrpeṟa iṉkavi coṉṉa tiṟattukkē?

**English translation of verse 7.9.8:**

Will I reach the end of satisfaction, if all the worlds,  
Up and down and those in the Milk-ocean assembled  
And praised the Lord, wielding the discus, Who made me laud  
Him, in hymns sweet, raising unto His level me, a mere dud?

**Notes:**

Yet another way of interpreting this song could be as follows: Even if the Āḻvār acquired the combined power of speech of the denizens of Earth, Heaven and the Milk-ocean, and expressed his gratitude for the Lord who chose him as His instrument for singing ‘Tiruvāymoḻi’, he can never reach the end of exhaustion. This is so, because the Lord not merely made the Āḻvār sing His glory, despite the absence of either the inclination or the competence therefor and on the top of that, He felt elated that His glory was heightened by the Āḻvār’s laudation. Even otherwise, the songs He made the Āḻvār sing are so very sweet and before this favour of His, all the others heaped on him pale into insignificance.




## 7.9.9
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

திறத்துக்கு ஏய் துப்புரவு ஆம் திருமாலின் சீர்,  
இறப்பு எதிர்காலம் பருகிலும் ஆர்வனோ,  
மறப்பு இலா என்னைத் தன்னாக்கி என்னால் தன்னை,  
உறப் பல இன்கவி சொன்ன உதவிக்கே?

tiṟattukku ēy tuppuravu ām tirumāliṉ cīr,  
iṟappu etirkālam parukilum ārvaṉō,  
maṟappu ilā eṉṉait taṉṉākki eṉṉāl taṉṉai,  
uṟap pala iṉkavi coṉṉa utavikkē?

**English translation of verse 7.9.9:**

Were I to muster back the entire past and assemble  
The whole future, right now, and enjoy the glory great  
Of the potent Lord, who unto His level did elevate  
Me, totally oblivious of Him, and made me warble  
Many a sweet song proclaiming His prowess great,  
I would still never feel satiate.

**Notes:**

In the preceding song, the Āḻvār mustered the combined power of speech of the denizens, currently on Earth, Heaven and Milk-ocean but now he invokes the aid of those who dwelt in those places in the past as well as the future inhabitants; with his insatiable ardour, he feels that all these agencies, put together, would still be inadequate.




## 7.9.10
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

உதவிக் கைம்மாறு என் உயிர் என்ன உற்று எண்ணில்,  
அதுவும் மற்று ஆங்கவன் தன்னது என்னால் தன்னைப்,  
பதவிய இன்கவி பாடிய அப்பனுக்கு,  
எதுவும் ஒன்றும் இல்லை செய்வது இங்கும் அங்கே.

utavik kaimmāṟu eṉ uyir eṉṉa uṟṟu eṇṇil,  
atuvum maṟṟu āṅkavaṉ taṉṉatu eṉṉāl taṉṉaip,  
pataviya iṉkavi pāṭiya appaṉukku,  
etuvum oṉṟum illai ceyvatu iṅkum aṅkē.

**English translation of verse 7.9.10:**

There’s nothing in all the worlds, here, there and everywhere  
With which to recompense the Lord Who made me hymn  
Songs sweet, this grand Hymnal adoring Him;  
Methought I could unto Him my soul offer  
But then even that is but His own.

**Notes:**

There’s no question of repaying the Lord’s extraordinary kindness; even otherwise, there is nothing the Āḻvār could call his own, which unto the Lord be could offer. Even the soul is not his but belongs to Him as His vassal from time immemorial. At least, in this land of dark nescience, people with their erronerous notions of ‘I’ and ‘Mine’ might commit the mistake of offering something to the Lord as their own and realise their mistake later on with the dawn of true knowledge regarding their essential nature. Surely, there is hardly any scope for the commission of a similar mistake in the yonder heaven populated by the ‘Nityās’ and ‘Muktās’, duly enlightened.




## 7.9.11
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

இங்கும் அங்கும் திருமால் அன்றி இன்மை கண்டு,  
அங்ஙனே வண் குருகூர்ச் சடகோபன்,  
இங்ஙனே சொன்ன ஓர் ஆயிரத்து இப்பத்தும்,  
எங்ஙனே சொல்லினும் இன்பம் பயக்குமே. (2)

iṅkum aṅkum tirumāl aṉṟi iṉmai kaṇṭu,  
aṅṅaṉē vaṇ kurukūrc caṭakōpaṉ,  
iṅṅaṉē coṉṉa ōr āyirattu ippattum,  
eṅṅaṉē colliṉum iṉpam payakkumē. (2)

**English translation of verse 7.9.11:**

These songs ten, out of the thousand sung  
By that great Saint, Kurukūr Caṭakōpaṉ,  
With no Refuge, both here and in Heaven,  
Other than ‘Tirumāl’, will breed joy, in whatever manner sung.

**Notes:**

This decad, whether sung with devotion or otherwise, will breed joy. The Āḻvār, who heads the clan of ‘Prapannas’ looks upon the Supreme Lord, the Spouse of Mahālakṣmī, as the Sole Refuge, both here, in the state of supplication and in Heaven, after attaining the final state of bissful union with the Lord. These songs, whether sung mechanically or with the ardour of the triple faculties of thought, words and deed, will generate joy on a par with the perrenial bliss of communion with the Lord. Certainly it goes without saying that it will be ideal if one sang these songs with due fervour.
