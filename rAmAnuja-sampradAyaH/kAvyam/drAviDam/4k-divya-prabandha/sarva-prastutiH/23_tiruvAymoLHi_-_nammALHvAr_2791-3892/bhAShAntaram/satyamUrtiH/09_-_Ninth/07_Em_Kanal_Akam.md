## 00 Intro9.7
The Āḻvār sustained himself, in a way, by contemplating the Lord’s auspicious traits, as in the last decad. In the process, he, however, developed a deep yearning for direct perception of the Lord. This led him on to send emissaries to the Lord to come down and grace him with His presence. And now, here is the last of the four decads in which messages were sent to the Lord by the Āḻvār, figuratively transformed as a forlorn female lover, the other three being I-4, VI-1 and VI-8. It may be recalled that the destinations of the messages sent to the Lord in the earlier decads, were the Milk-ocean, where the Lord stays in His ‘Vyuha’ form, the seat of creative activity, His incarnate forms and His transcendental Form in Heaven as well as His ‘Antaryāmi’ or hidden Form, as the Internal Controller. The traits of the Lord, which held out a special fascination to the Nāyakī, while sending those messages, were, Forgiveness, His creed or pledge to extend protection to His devotees and His feeling of oneness with His devotees (aikarasya) (*i.e*.) sense of identity with them and deep compassion. The message, as in this decad, is, however, addressed to the Lord in His ‘Arca’ (Iconic, worshippable) form, the special accent being on His enchanting beauty.

Vide aphorism 156 of ‘Ācārya Hṛdayam, Put briefly, the message in this decad, to be conveyed by the birds to the Lord, is:

> “Oh, Sire, enshrined as You are in Tirumūḻikkaḷam (a pilgrim centre in
> Kerala state), You seem to have got completely absorbed in the company
> of Your consorts and proximate attendants, to the exclusion of poor
> Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī. Alas! the Nāyakī, enthralled by Your exquisite
> beauty, can hardly brook separation from You any longer. Please take
> note of this fact and hasten to her”.

**English translation of verse 9.7.1:**

Ye, red-legged stork lovely, that loiters in our garden canal,  
In search of food, may you go on an errand  
To my Lord in Tirumūḻikkaḷam, the pot-dancer grand,  
Wearing on His crown honey-studded tuḻaci garland  
And my head bedeck, on your return,  
With your (weary) legs, along with your kin.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The birds, ostensibly employed by the Āḻvār to convey his message to the Lord at Tirumūḻikkaḷam, symbolise the great preceptors. This has been clearly brought out in this opening song where the Āḻvār wants the birds to place their legs on his head, which, if taken literally, would not make much sense. The invocation is, therefore, to the illustrious Ācāryas to shed their grace on the Āḻvār by placing their legs on his head. c.f. Tiruviruttam—54, where the Āḻvār sought the good offices of the bees to put him on to the impeccable lotus feet of the Lord of the Celestials. It is evident that the bees in question denote none but the competent preceptors, who ensure our attainment of the Lord.

\(ii\) *Our garden Canal*: Possessivity, that is, “My-ness”, sense of ownership should, in general, be eschewed and yet, it is indeed wholesome and welcome, when it is invoked for the benefit of others, and not for one’s own selfish ends. It is the Nāyakī’s garden where the birds lovingly loiter and this link with them helps her to commission them to carry her message to the Lord, by way of making Him aware of her parlous state. The birds are near at hand, in the Nāyakī’s garden, instead of her having to go in search of them; this is indeed a great boon, comparable to Mahāpūrṇar, the preceptor of Śrī Rāmānuja, staying in the latter’s house and imparting religious instructions.

\(iii\) *Storks with legs, red and lovely*: The storks denote the Ācāryas, as set out in (1) above, and it is but appropriate that their legs, the very haven of the disciple, are alluded to in such endearing terms.




## 9.7.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நுமரோடும் பிரியாதே நீரும் நும் சேவலுமாய்  
அமர்காதல் குருகுஇனங்காள்! அணி மூழிக்களத்து உறையும்  
எமராலும் பழிப்புண்டு இங்கு என்தம்மால் இழிப்புண்டு  
தமரோடுஅங்கு உறைவார்க்குத் தக்கிலமே! கேளீரே.

numarōṭum piriyātē nīrum num cēvalumāy  
amarkātal kurukuiṉaṅkāḷ! aṇi mūḻikkaḷattu uṟaiyum  
emarālum paḻippuṇṭu iṅku eṉtammāl iḻippuṇṭu  
tamarōṭuaṅku uṟaivārkkut takkilamē! kēḷīrē.

**English translation of verse 9.7.2:**

Ye, herds of herons, moving with your mates inseparable,  
Better go and enquire of the Lord who dwells  
In Tirumūḻikkajam, whether I, by Him despised,  
And for that reason, by my kith and kin accused,  
Won’t be good company for those that on Him attend;  
‘Tis no use prolonging my agony, let me my life end.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The Lord stays in Tirumūḻikkaḷam, attended upon by a large number of devotees and it is but natural that the Nāyakī also longs to be in such good company. Her emissaries, the birds, are also merry, enjoying connubial bliss, and moving about in their flocks and it is only appropriate that the Nāyakī invokes their aid to cure her of her solitude and restore her to the Lord’s company in that glorious setting. Indeed, it behoves the affluent, far above wants, to feed the hungry and lift them from the pangs of hunger!

\(ii\) The Nāyakī feels that she is in an unenviable predicament and it would indeed be just as well that she ceased to exist. The Lord and she had been locked up, in union, only to be deserted by Him. This gave her kith and kin the handle to give her up and so, she is neither here nor there. There is, of course, no reason why the Lord should give her up and she suspects that the Lord has just forgotten her, absorbed that He is in the sweet company of His devotees, gathered in that holy centre. The birds in question are now required to remind Him of the lonely existence of the Nāyakī, at this end and the imperative need for His admitting her also into His fold over there.




## 9.7.3
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

தக்கிலமே கேளீர்கள் தடம்புனல்வாய் இரைதேரும்  
கொக்குஇனங்காள்! குருகுஇனங்காள்! குளிர் மூழிக்களத்து உறையும்  
செக்கமலத்துஅலர் போலும் கண்கைகால் செங்கனிவாய்

cekkamalattualar pōlum kaṇkaikāl ceṅkaṉivāy  
akkamalattuilaippōlum tirumēṉi aṭikaḷukkē.

**English translation of verse 9.7.3:**

Ye, flocks of cranes and herons, your food you seek  
In the big ponds over here, better go to cool Mūḻikkaḷam and ask  
The Lord whose eyes, hands and feet and the red lotus are alike,  
Whose lips are like a red fruit and whose complexion does match  
The lotus leaf, whether unto Him I won’t be a match.

**Notes:**

\(i\) In each of the four decads, where the Nāyakī despatched messages to her Lord, there is one song, considered to be the very cream of that decad. And now, here is the topical song of this decad. Apprehending that the Lord is totally absorbed in the sweet company of the devotees surrounding Him at Tirumūḻikkaḷam. forgetting all about the Nāyakī, she now wants these birds to remind Him of how she got enthralled by His exquisite charm, reducing her to her present state. The Lord would seem to be oblivious of His own enthralling beauty which had brought on the Nāyakī’s infatuation to such a high pitch that she can’t brook separation from Him, any longer. So then, the Nāyakī deems it fit to remind the Lord, through these birds, of His own ravishing beauty and the magic spell it has cast on the Nāyakī, in particular. It is this special feature that characterises this decad. See also the preamble to this decad, where it has been set out that the Lord’s enchanting charm, in His iconic Form, is the source of inspiration for the Nāyakī’s message conveyed through these birds.

\(ii\) The Nāyakī, according to Nampiḷḷai, wants these birds to ascertain from the Lord whether He has at all any fascination for her. If the reply be in the affirmative, she would try her best to hold on to her life; if otherwise, she would seek some means to put an end to her life, even as Sītā, in captivity, made a desperate bid to strangle herself with her long locks.

\(iii\) The Lord’s complexion is compared to the lotus leaf. See also the Śloka in Rāmāyaṇa which affirms this: ‘tam padmadala patrākṣam’. The word ‘akṣa [akṣam]’. refers both to the eye and the body, the former is comparable to the lotus petals and the latter to the lotus leaf.




## 9.7.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

திருமேனி அடிகளுக்குத் தீவினையேன் விடுதூதாய்  
திருமூழிக்களம் என்னும் செழுநகர்வாய் அணிமுகில்காள்  
திருமேனி அவட்குஅருளீர் என்றக்கால் உம்மைத்தன்  
திருமேனி ஒளிஅகற்றி தெளிவிசும்பு கடியுமே?

tirumēṉi aṭikaḷukkut tīviṉaiyēṉ viṭutūtāy  
tirumūḻikkaḷam eṉṉum ceḻunakarvāy aṇimukilkāḷ  
tirumēṉi avaṭkuaruḷīr eṉṟakkāl ummaittaṉ  
tirumēṉi oḷiakaṟṟi teḷivicumpu kaṭiyumē?

**English translation of verse 9.7.4:**

Ye, pretty clouds, were you to run an errand  
On behalf of this sinner unto my Master of form grand,  
Who does in holy Tirumūḻikkaḷam dwell  
And a word unto Him tell  
That He should unto me offer His body gracious,  
Do you fear that you He would punish,  
Put you off colour and out of the clear sky push?

**Notes:**

\(i\) *My Master of form grand*: His auspicious traits and wondrous deeds apart, the Lord’s enchanting Form is such as to enthral one and all, including the ungodly. Duryodhan [Duryodhana] and his men were studiously determined not to get up from their seats and extend any courtesy whatsoever to Lord Kṛṣṇa when He arrived at the royal court, as the errand boy of the Pāṇḍavās. But, as soon as the Lord entered the court, all of them, including the deadly Duryodhan, stood up automatically, entranced by the unique halo and splendour of His enchanting Form.

\(ii\) Sinner though, the Nāyakī deems it her great good fortune to fall at the feet of these birds, the Lord’s devotees and to beg of them to tell the Lord in Tirumūḻikkaḷam, “Here is the Nāyakī languishing for you inside the hollow of the holy tamarind tree at Āḻvār Tirunakari.” She exhorts the clouds not to apprehend any punishment for this, at the hands of the Lord, by way of pushing them out of the clear sky and depriving them of their lovely hue. On the other hand, the Lord will impart to them still greater lustre.




## 9.7.5
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

தெளிவிசும்பு கடிதுஓடி தீவளைத்து மின்இலகும்  
ஒளிமுகில்காள்! திருமூழிக்களத்துஉறையும் ஒண்சுடர்க்கு  
தெளிவிசும்பு திருநாடாத் தீவினையேன் மனத்துஉறையும்  
துளிவார்கள்குழலார்க்கு என்தூதுஉரைத்தல் செப்புமினே.

teḷivicumpu kaṭituōṭi tīvaḷaittu miṉilakum  
oḷimukilkāḷ! tirumūḻikkaḷattuuṟaiyum oṇcuṭarkku  
teḷivicumpu tirunāṭāt tīviṉaiyēṉ maṉattuuṟaiyum  
tuḷivārkaḷkuḻalārkku eṉtūtuuraittal ceppumiṉē.

**English translation of verse 9.7.5:**

Ye, lovely clouds, speeding across the immaculate sky,  
Holding in your bosom, lightning like unto the arc fiery!  
Convey my message, will you unto the Lord resplendent,  
Who is in Tirumūḻikkaḷam resident,  
Whose locks shed honey in plenty and Who in this sinner’s heart dwells  
With all the affection He bestows on the heaven impeccable.

**Notes:**

\(i\) Seeing that the clouds were rather diffident of being heard by the Lord, the Nāyakī assures them of positive response by the Lord. The Nāyakī’s confidence stemmed from the fact that the Lord got Himself lodged in her heart with all the affection He bestows on His transcendent abode, called Heaven.

\(ii\) The lightning appears in the clouds only when they are about to rain. The rain clouds, referred to, in this song, however, denote the great preceptors, resplendent like the Lord Himself, showering knowledge on the disciples, all over.

\(iii\) *This Sinner’s heart*: The sin, alluded to, is the Nāyakī’s inability to envision the Lord, although He is very much in her heart. One Ciṟṟāḻkoṇṭāṉ would say: “It is indeed a long distance between the actual realisation of God and the mere inward mental conception of the Lord. To aspire for the former, right when God-love blooms in one’s heart, is like opening a cloth-shop and announcing to the public that clothes are ready for sale while the cotton for these clothes is still lying raw in its pods on the tree.” [As the Englishman would put it this is like attempting to sell the lion-skin even before the lion is hunted].

\(iv\) *Convey my message*: The message from one, on whose locks the flower has dried down to a mere shred, to Him whose, locks are bedecked with flowers, shedding honey profusely.




## 9.7.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

தூதுஉரைத்தல் செப்புமின்கள் தூமொழிவாய் வண்டுஇனங்காள்

mātaraittam mārvakattē vaittārkku eṉvāymāṟṟam  
tūtuuraittal cepputirēl cuṭarvaḷaiyum kalaiyumē.

**English translation of verse 9.7.6:**

Ye, sweet-sounding bees, if you would unto my Lord fly down,  
Who the Divine Mother bears on His winsome chest and goes gay,  
Residing in Tirumūḻikkaḷam, full of flower gardens,  
Shedding honey in plenty and unto Him my oral message convey,  
My saree and bangles I shall indeed regain.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The *Sweet-sounding* bees typify the Ācāryas who can win over the Lord through their *persuasive eloquence*.

\(ii\) The Nāyakī does not even want the bees to come back and tell her what the Lord has to say in reply to her message. It would indeed be sufficient if they just conveyed her message to the Lord who is her avowed Saviour, pledged to protect her. What is even more assuring to the Nāyakī is the effective intercession and purposeful pleading of Śrī Mahālakṣmī, on behalf of the Nāyakī. All that the bees have got to do is to go to Tirumūḻik-kaḻam, where the flower gardens yield plenty of food (honey) for them and incidentally tell the Lord about her in the immediate presence of Lakṣmī. In that propitious setting, the Nāyakī is quite sanguine of the result, namely, the restoration of the Lord to her and that would mean, she will, once again, don her saree all right and the bangles will also rest well on her wrist.




## 9.7.7
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

சுடர்வளையும் கலையும்கொண்டு அருவினையேன் தோள்துறந்த  
படர்புகழான் திருமூழிக்களத்துஉறையும் பங்கயக்கண்

**English translation of verse 9.7.7:**

Ye, Koel birds that in this spacious garden dwell,  
For my sake, a good word you have one day to tell  
Unto my lotus-eyed Lord, with lovely lips like the coral red,  
Of wide-spread fame, Who does in Tirumūḻikkaḷam reside,  
Who this fell sinner’s shoulders deserted,  
Taking away my beaming bangles and saree as well.

**Notes:**

The Nāyakī, in her present state of separation after the erstwhile union with her Lord, is literally denuded of her feminity which the bangles and saree denote. She wants these birds to go and tell the enchanting Lord at Tirumūḻikkaḷam that it was next to impossible for her to be apart from Him, of exquisite beauty, having tasted the bliss earlier.




## 9.7.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

எனக்குஒன்று பணியீர்கள் இரும்பொழில்வாய் இரைதேர்ந்து  
மனக்குஇன்பம் படமேவும் வண்டுஇனங்காள்! தும்பிகாள்  
கனக்கொள் திண்மதிள்புடைசூழ் திருமூழிக் களத்துஉறையும்

kaṉakkoḷ tiṇmatiḷpuṭaicūḻ tirumūḻik kaḷattuuṟaiyum  
puṉakkoḷ kāyāmēṉip pūntuḻāy muṭiyārkkē.

**English translation of verse 9.7.8:**

Ye, bees and beetles, moving in pleasant company  
In these spacious gardens, in search of honey,  
For me put in a word unto my Lord, sporting tuḷaci lovely  
On His crown, of the complexion of the blue lily,  
Who does in Tirumūḻikkaḷam dwell,  
Surrounded by walls, tough and tall.

**Notes:**

The Nāyakī says, there is no use of these bees and beetles making merry in the company of their mates, gathering honey, without making her also happy. She, therefore, beckons them to go and tell the Lord in that holy centre, well fortified, how she longs to behold His exquisite Form. Here, at this end, the Nāyakī is in a precarious condition, while, at the other end, the Lord stands pledged to redeem the devout seeking His protection.




## 9.7.9
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

பூந்துழாய் முடியார்க்கு பொன்ஆழிக் கையாருக்கு  
ஏந்துநீர் இளம்குருகே! திருமூழிக்களத்தாருக்கு

**English translation of verse 9.7.9:**

Ye, tiny heron, strutting gaily in the waters, go and tell  
Unto my Lord who does in Tirumūḻikkaḷam dwell,  
Holding the discus lovely and sporting tuḷaci on His crown  
Tis hardly fair that He should have from me gone,  
Taking His body along, making my flowery eyes water down  
And my breasts bedecked, lose their lustre fine.

**Notes:**

The Nāyakī is so much obsessed with the Lord’s exquisite charm that she feels, it was hardly fair of Him to have got away from her, after their erstwhile union, without leaving His body behind! Ludicrous it might seem but it goes to convey that the Nāyakī just cannot bear being apart from the Lord, even for a split second.




## 9.7.10
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

தகவுஅன்றுஎன்று உரையீர்கள் தடம்புனல்வாய் இரைதேர்ந்து  
மிகஇன்பம் படமேவும் மேல்நடைய அன்னங்காள்  
மிகமேனி மெலிவுஎய்தி மேகலையும் ஈடுஅழிந்து என்

**English translation of verse 9.7.10:**

Ye, swans of gentle gait, moving along merrily in fields fertile.  
In search of food, unto the Lord in Tirumūḻikkaḷam go and tell,  
‘Tis hardly fair that He should despise me; only then,  
My body, the saree thereon and my inner soul I can retain.

**Notes:**

The great Ācāryas, who go about delving and gathering the most delicious meanings, the scriptural texts can possibly yield, are referred to here, as the swans, endowed with the special faculty of picking up milk from a mixture of milk and water. The Nāyakī’s appeal to the Lord’s special trait of mercy is bound to go home to Him, as He cannot afford to risk His reputation, as the All-merciful, No doubt, the Lord’s infinite mercy can never be exhausted even as the oceanic waters can never go dry. And yet, what is now sought to be pointed out by the Nāyakī is that His keeping aloof of her is by-no-means consistent with His great quality of mercy and cannot be deemed to be a happy trend, in this context.




## 9.7.11
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஒழிவுஇன்றித் திருமூழிக்களத்துஉறையும் ஒண்சுடரை  
ஒழிவுஇல்லா அணிமழலைக் கிளிமொழியாள் அலற்றியசொல்

**English translation of verse 9.7.11:**

These songs ten, out of the eternal thousand, uttered by Caṭakōpaṉ,  
Of Kurukūr, soaked in God-love impeccable,  
Voicing forth the sweet-tongued Nāyakī’s pangs of separation  
From the resplendent Lord Who does, for ever, in Tirumūḻikkaḷam dwell.  
Will the fell malady, the bondage of saṃsāra dispel.

**Notes:**

This decad will cut out the bondage of its chanters, the worldly ties, which operate as an impediment to the attainment of God-head. In other words, this decad cures the malady of separation from the Lord and the resultant state of desolation.

The resplendent Lord, in His iconic manifestation in Tirumūḻikkaḷam, is the Doctor who stays on permanently in our midst, determined to cure the malady of ‘saṃsāra’ of the devout seekers.
