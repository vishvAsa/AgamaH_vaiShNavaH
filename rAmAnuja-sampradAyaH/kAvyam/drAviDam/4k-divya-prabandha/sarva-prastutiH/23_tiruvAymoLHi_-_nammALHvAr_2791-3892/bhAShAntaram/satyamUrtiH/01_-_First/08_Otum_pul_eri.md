## 00 Intro1.8
In this decad, the Āḻvār brings to the fore the Lord’s quality of ‘Uprightness’ (*ārjava* or *rujuḥ*), His transparence in word, deed and thought, free from sophistry, duplicity, mental reservation, mischievous distortion etc. The Lord would not mean one thing, say another and do a third thing. When Sūrpaṇakhā saw Śrī Rāma at Pañcavaṭi and interrogated Him about His personal history, there would have been nothing wrong if He had tactfully withheld the truth from the demoness. But it was not in His grain to do so and hence He gave out the actual fact with remarkable sincerity.

Tirukkurukaippirāṉ Piḷḷāṉ, the earliest glossator on ‘Tiruvāymoḻi,’ holds that this decad highlights the Lord’s wealth (*Aiśvarya*). The other commentators, Periyavāccāṉ Piḷḷai and Vaṭakku Tiruvīti Piḷḷai, however, prefer to bring into focus the Lord’s ‘*ārjava*’ in this decad, as stated at the outset.




## 1.8.1
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஓடும் புள் ஏறி, சூடும் தண் துழாய்,  
நீடு நின்றவை, ஆடும் அம்மானே.

ōṭum puḷ ēṟi, cūṭum taṇ tuḻāy,  
nīṭu niṉṟavai, āṭum ammāṉē.

**English translation of verse 1.8.1:**

The Lord (in heaven) does avidly mingle  
With the exalted celestials, one and all;  
Takes He a lightning ride on a bird (Garuḍa)  
And sports the cool tulacī garland delectable.

**Note**

This refers to the state of affairs in the yonder heaven. The Lord is said to regale one and all over there, by granting them suitable opportunities for rendering Him the appropriate service.






## 1.8.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அம்மானாய்ப் பின்னும், எம்மாண்பும் ஆனான்,  
வெம் மா வாய் கீண்ட, செம்மா கண்ணனே.

ammāṉāyp piṉṉum, emmāṇpum āṉāṉ,  
vem mā vāy kīṇṭa, cemmā kaṇṇaṉē.

**English translation of verse 1.8.2:**

Our Sire (the Lord) with large, red eyes  
Came down as Kaṇṇaṉ (and mingled with us)  
Tore He the mouth of the demon fierce,  
Who (to Kill Him) came as a horse,  
Many indeed are His incarnations glorious

**Note**

Although specific mention has been made here of the Lord’s incarnation as Kṛṣṇa, there is also a broad reference to all His Avatāras as well, wherein He mixes with the worldlings with remarkable transparence, even as He does with the denizens in heaven.




## 1.8.3
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கண் ஆவான் என்றும், மண்ணோர் விண்ணோர்க்கு,  
தண் ஆர் வேங்கட, விண்ணோர் வெற்பனே.

kaṇ āvāṉ eṉṟum, maṇṇōr viṇṇōrkku,  
taṇ ār vēṅkaṭa, viṇṇōr veṟpaṉē.

**English translation of verse 1.8.3:**

The Lord who is like unto a pair of eyes  
For those on Earth and Heaven,  
Stays in Vēṅkaṭam, cool and nice.  
The Celestials’ favourite haven.

**Note**

Like unto the mother of twins lying in between her two kids, the Lord stays in Tiruvēṅkaṭam (in Andhra Pradesh), the meeting ground of the Earthlings and the Celestials. The Āḻvār even goes to the extent of calling this glorious hilly retreat as the home of the Celestials, on the ground that the Celestials visiting it far exceed the number of the earthly visitors. Actually, it is the amazing simplicity of the Supreme Lord, making Himself easily accessible even to the monkeys and hunters around this sacred spot, that drags the celestials on to this centre. It is reverently held by our elders that the fauna and flora on the sacred Hills are but Celestials transplanted there.




## 1.8.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வெற்பை ஒன்று எடுத்து, ஒற்கம் இன்றியே,  
நிற்கும் அம்மான் சீர், கற்பன் வைகலே.

veṟpai oṉṟu eṭuttu, oṟkam iṉṟiyē,  
niṟkum ammāṉ cīr, kaṟpaṉ vaikalē.

**English translation of verse 1.8.4:**

Let me every day utter (and adore)  
The Lord’s grace galore;  
Mount (Govardhana) He did lift  
And stood with ease (holding it aloft).

**Notes**

\(i\) Periyāḻvār extols the effortless holding by Śrī Kṛṣṇa of Govardhana Mountain, days on end, without the slightest strain on His fingers and nails (Periyāḻvār Tirumoḻi III-5-10).

\(ii\) Śrī Kūrattāḻvāṉ also exclaims, in sloka 45 of *Varadarāja Stavaṃ* that the Lord held Mount Govardhana continually for seven days and yet, His fingers were as fresh as ever.

\(iii\) The irate Indra, out to destroy the pastoral life of Gokul, could have well been destroyed by Śrī Kṛṣṇa but He relented, hoping that Indra would soon recover from this temporary aberration caused by the deprivation of the offerings. At the same time. He shielded the entire pastoral community by holding the mountain aloft like an umbrella for seven long days, till Indra’s fury abated. The Āḻvār, on his part, would never feel tired of recounting this episode, rather he subsists on it.




## 1.8.5
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வைகலும் வெண்ணெய், கைகலந்து உண்டான்,  
பொய் கலவாது, என் மெய்கலந்தானே.

vaikalum veṇṇey, kaikalantu uṇṭāṉ,  
poy kalavātu, eṉ meykalantāṉē.

**English translation of verse 1.8.5:**

The Lord stretched His hands as far as He could,  
(Snatched) the butter and ate (as much as He liked);  
Truly, He my body liked in that fashion  
And there ensued the grand fusion.

**Note**

On the one hand, the Āḻvār goes into raptures in contemplation of the Lord’s auspicious attributes and, on the other, the Lord covets the Āḻvār’s body with the same avidity with which He swallowed butter in Gokula.




## 1.8.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கலந்து என் ஆவி, நலம்கொள்நாதன்,  
புலன் கொள் மாணாய், நிலம்கொண்டானே.

kalantu eṉ āvi, nalamkoḷnātaṉ,  
pulaṉ koḷ māṇāy, nilamkoṇṭāṉē.

**English translation of verse 1.8.6:**

The Lord Who uṇto me adhered  
And did my Soul make good  
Took, as a Midget (Vāmaṉa) of enthralling form,  
Land (of three strides) as alms.

**Note**

As dwarfish Vāmaṉa of bewitching personality, He enticed away Emperor Bali and made all his possessions, His own; likewise, mixing now with the Āḻvār, the Lord has taken possession of his soul and made him His sole servitor, in keeping with his essential nature.




## 1.8.7
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கொண்டான் ஏழ் விடை, உண்டான் ஏழ்வையம்,  
தண் தாமம் செய்து, என் எண்தானானானே.

koṇṭāṉ ēḻ viṭai, uṇṭāṉ ēḻvaiyam,  
taṇ tāmam ceytu, eṉ eṇtāṉāṉāṉē.

**English translation of verse 1.8.7:**

Tamed He the unruly bulls seven,  
Held He in His stomach the worlds seven  
And thinking my own thoughts (in reverse direction)  
He took to my body as if it were cool heaven.

**Notes**

\(i\) To win the hand of the bewitching young damsel, Nap-piṇṇai, a niece of Yaśodhā, the unruly bulls were the impediments; the Lord, as Śrī Kṛṣṇa, overcame them and secured the coveted bride. Likewise, the Āḻvār’s sins, the impediments for the Lord getting at him, were rooted out by Him and the Āḻvār taken possession of.

\(ii\) During the period of deluge, the Lord held within Himself all the worlds and sustained them and now, He could sustain Himself only by entering the Āḻvār’s soul and dissolving into it.

\(iii\) The Āḻvār was pining for his ascent to Heaven, dipping in the Sacred river Vrajā, coursing on its border and chanting Sāma Veda in heaven; these very thoughts the Lord would, however, think in the reverse order, namely, pining for the Āḻvār’s body in Tirunakari, dipping in the river Tāmraparṇi and singing the hymns composed by the Sweet-tongued poet (Madhura Kavi) in adoration of the Āḻvār.




## 1.8.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஆனான் ஆன் ஆயன், மீனோடேனமும்;  
தான் ஆனான் என்னில், தானாயசங்கே.

āṉāṉ āṉ āyaṉ, mīṉōṭēṉamum;  
tāṉ āṉāṉ eṉṉil, tāṉāyacaṅkē.

**English translation of verse 1.8.8:**

Myriads are the Lord’s incarnations;  
As the Cowherd He came down,  
Fish, Boar and many other forms  
He took, just to get hold of me.

**Note**

The Āḻvār feels that the innumerable Avatāras of the Lord were all for his delectation, mainly directed towards getting hold of him and uniting with him.




## 1.8.9
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

சங்கு சக்கரம், அங்கையில் கொண்டான்,  
எங்கும் தானாய, நங்கள் நாதனே.

caṅku cakkaram, aṅkaiyil koṇṭāṉ,  
eṅkum tāṉāya, naṅkaḷ nātaṉē.

**English translation of verse 1.8.9:**

Conch and discus, our Lord holds in His lovely hands  
No matter where and in what form He descends.

**Note**

The Lord who thus incarnates, for my sake, through different gates of birth, always bears the inseparable Conch and Discus, like unto the potion carried by some to entice people. These may, however, be visible only to some Godly souls and not all. The Lord’s descent could be likened to the Earthly Kings moving round their cities during nights, disguised in black clothes, to study men and matters at first hand, and locate miscreants operating under cover of darkness. The security forces or bodyguards also keep stirring about during those occasions, suitably masked, ready at hand, in an emergency call from the King. The Conch and Discus and other intimate attendants of the Lord, likewise, keep Him company during the Avatāras.




## 1.8.10
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நாதன்ஞாலம்கொள் பாதன், என்னம்மான்,  
ஓதம்போல்கிளர், வேதநீரனே.

nātaṉñālamkoḷ pātaṉ, eṉṉammāṉ,  
ōtampōlkiḷar, vētanīraṉē.

**English translation of verse 1.8.10:**

The Sovereign Master (of the whole universe) whose feet  
Measured all the worlds is my Sire upright fit, indeed  
For the Vedas (vociferous like the ocean) to talk about.

**Note**

The Āḻvār, who was all along maintaining that the Supreme Lord’s numerous incarnations were all for his sake, now says: “Who am I to voice forth the loving tenderness of the Lord, His uprightness which induced Him to incarnate so many times and iṇ so many ways? None is more competent to talk about Him Who, as Tṛivikrama, set His feet on one and all without distinction of high and low, than the Vedas, vociferous like the oceanic waters, in singing His glorious traits”.




## 1.8.11
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நீர்புரைவண்ணன், சீர்சடகோபன்,  
நேர்தல் ஆயிரத்து, ஓர்தல்இவையே.

nīrpuraivaṇṇaṉ, cīrcaṭakōpaṉ,  
nērtal āyirattu, ōrtalivaiyē.

**English translation of verse 1.8.11:**

These songs ten, out of the thousand  
Sung by Caṭakōpaṉ reveal his view profound  
That the Lord of water—tint  
Is like water, pliable and transparent.

**Note**

The terminal stanza in each of the preceding decads set forth the good results flowing from the study or recital of the stanzas in that decad. This end-song is, however, silent in this regard; instead, it says that, in this decad, the Āḻvār has expressed his considered view, the one that is crystal-clear to him from the entire hymnal, namely, the Lord is transparent, progressive and pliable like water whose complexion He bears.
