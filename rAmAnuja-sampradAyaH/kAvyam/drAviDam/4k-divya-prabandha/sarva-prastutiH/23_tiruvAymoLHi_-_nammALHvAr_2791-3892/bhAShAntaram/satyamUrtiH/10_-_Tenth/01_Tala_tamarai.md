## 00 Intro10.1
The declaration, made by the Saint in the preceding decad, that the Lord is the great Benefactor Who would grant ‘Mokṣa’ (eternal emancipation) when this body of ours falls off, is with reference to the clear assurance given to him by the Lord, to this effect. What looked earlier like an indefinite prospect has now acquired a concrete shape, time-bound, the farthest limit being the fall of the body at the end of the current span of life. Well, that he was fast nearing the end of his soul’s journey, the Āḻvār was quite conscious of. His body had worn out to an extent that gave clear indication of its falling off very soon and the Āḻvār knew quite well that the day of his promised ascent to Heaven was near at hand. So then, the Āḻvār set about preparing for the final lap of his journey to the Celestium and sought the good offices of the Lord, in His worshippable form at Tirumōkūr, to escort him through. Finding the Lord at Tirumōkūr, as the super-abundant Benefactor, with profound knowledge and prowess, capable of steering through all obstacles, the Āḻvār got hold of Him as the unfailing escort, during his onward march to yonder Heaven.

But then, it might be questioned whether, during the soul’s ascent to Heaven, the Lord’s good offices should be specially requisitioned as above, seeing that the ‘Arcis’ and other functionaries do conduct the Heaven-bound souls and take charge of them at the various stages of the journey, in all their details. The answer to this poser can, however, be found in the Lord’s own declaration in the carama śloka, delivered during His advent as Varāha Nāyaṉār (The Great Boar)—“Ahaṃ smarāmi Mad bhaktaṃ *nayāmi* paramāṃ gatim”. The word in italics reveals that the Lord Himself conducts the liberated souls to the highest abode, namely, Heaven. This “Mārga Bandhu”, the Āḻvār could spot out in the Lord at Tirumōkūr (near Maturai, in Tamil Nāḍu) and he, therefore, extols Him, in this decad. Apart from the Lord’s attainments, His bewitching beauty is enough to make the Āḻvār follow Him, enjoying His exquisite charm, all along.




## 10.1.1
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

தாள தாமரைத் தடம்அணி வயல் திருமோகூர்  
நாளும் மேவி நன்குஅமர்ந்து நின்று அசுரரைத் தகர்க்கும்  
தோளும் நான்குஉடைச் சுரிகுழல் கமலக்கண் கனிவாய்க்  
காள மேகத்தை அன்றி மற்றொன்றுஇலம் கதியே. (2)

tāḷa tāmarait taṭamaṇi vayal tirumōkūr  
nāḷum mēvi naṉkuamarntu niṉṟu acurarait takarkkum  
tōḷum nāṉkuuṭaic curikuḻal kamalakkaṇ kaṉivāyk  
kāḷa mēkattai aṉṟi maṟṟoṉṟuilam katiyē. (2)

**English translation of verse 10.1.1:**

Escort have we none but the cloud-hued Lord,  
With shoulders four that shall the Asuras smite,  
Curly locks, lotus eyes and lips, red and bright,  
Who does for ever dwell with great delight  
In Tirumōkūr with strong-petalled lotus ponds and rich paddy fields.

**Notes:**

\(i\) It is but natural that a person, roasted by gruelling heat, looks for relief through a deep plunge into a cool pond or showers from the sky. The Āḻvār, about to be rid of the parching heat of Saṃsāra, has likewise got hold of Lord ‘Kāḷamēgam enshrined in Tirumōkūr. This Deity has also been referred to, later in this decad-vide eighth song, as the pond, cool and lovely, yielded by king Daśaratha, the safe Refuge, rather the one and only Refuge.

\(ii\) The lotus ponds and the paddy fields allude to the great ones, characterised by plain living (lying low, in utter humility, like the paddy crops studded with grains) and high thinking (like the lotus flowers, displayed majestically on the tall stalks sprouting from the watery depths).

\(iii\) The Lord resides in this sportive universe, with greater delight than in Heaven, because it is here that His auspicious traits of easy accessibility, tender solicitude etc., shine with greater splendour, like unto a lamp lit at night, as distinguished from one commissioned in broad day-light.

\(iv\) Even in His Area or Iconic manifestation at Tirumōkūr, the Lord’s sinewy shoulders proclaim the valorous deeds performed by them during His Avatāras (Incarnations), like unto the ear lobes, though not decorated with earrings at present, telling the tale of their erstwhile decoration.




## 10.1.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

இலங்கதி மற்றொன்று எம்மைக்கும் ஈன்தண் துழாயின்  
அலங்கலங்கண்ணி ஆயிரம் பேர்உடை அம்மான்  
நலங்கொள் நான்மறை வாணர்கள் வாழ் திருமோகூர்  
நலங்கழல் அவன் அடிநிழல் தடமன்றி யாமே.

ilaṅkati maṟṟoṉṟu emmaikkum īṉtaṇ tuḻāyiṉ  
alaṅkalaṅkaṇṇi āyiram pēruṭai ammāṉ  
nalaṅkoḷ nāṉmaṟai vāṇarkaḷ vāḻ tirumōkūr  
nalaṅkaḻal avaṉ aṭiniḻal taṭamaṉṟi yāmē.

**English translation of verse 10.1.2:**

Time without end. refuge have we none  
But that lovely pond, the patronising shelter of the feet  
Of the Lord, sporting tuḻaci garland, cool and fine,  
Bearing a thousand names, Who has His feet firmly set  
In Tirumōkūr, the abode of many a Vedic Scholar, sweet and sound.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The Āḻvār avers that there is no haven till the end of time, other than the lovely pair of feet of the Lord at Tirumōkūr, of exquisite charm, feasting the eyes, bearing the holy names that elevate the soul.

\(ii\) The Lord’s feet know no partiality, granting, as they do, shelter to one and all, irrespective of whether they are high or low, good or bad. cf. “anālocita viśeṣa aśeṣa Loka Śaraṇyā!” (Saint Rāmānuja’s address to the Lord in “Śaraṇāgati gadya”).

\(iii\) When one starts lauding the Lord, enthralled by His exquisite charm and His sinewy shoulders, sporting the lovely garland, His names afford ample scope for the enjoyment of His great glory, from various angles. Further, it makes one repent for one’s failure to recite the Lord’s names bespeaking His great glory, in the days gone by.




## 10.1.3
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அன்றியாம் ஒரு புகலிடம் இலம் என்றுஎன்று அலற்றி  
நின்று நான்முகன் அரனொடு தேவர்கள் நாட  
வென்று இம்மூவுலகுஅளித்து உழல்வான் திருமோகூர்  
நன்று நாம் இனி நணுகுதும் நமதுஇடர் கெடவே.

aṉṟiyām oru pukaliṭam ilam eṉṟueṉṟu alaṟṟi  
niṉṟu nāṉmukaṉ araṉoṭu tēvarkaḷ nāṭa  
veṉṟu immūvulakuaḷittu uḻalvāṉ tirumōkūr  
naṉṟu nām iṉi naṇukutum namatuiṭar keṭavē.

**English translation of verse 10.1.3:**

May we from all our ills be free,  
Getting well nigh Tirumōkūr, where stays the Lord,  
Pledged to protect the worlds thiee,  
Who did the arch enemies rid,  
Of Nāṉmukān, Araṉ and other devas who for succour prayed  
Unto Him, reclaiming many a time.  
That refuge they had none but Him.

**Notes:**

“The Lord at Tirumōkūr is the Universal Protector and we, His vassals, are keen on getting His protection. We will, therefore, do well to get near the holy city, seek shelter at the feet of the Lord, as an end in itself, and be rid of all of our miseries”, says the Āḻvār. Herein lies the difference between the Āḻvār’s method of approach and that of Brahmā and other Devas who sought the Lord at the Milk-ocean, to secure their personal ends and the demoniac Kālayavanan, Jarāsanthan etc. who went to Mathura, bent upon evil.




## 10.1.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

இடர்கெட எம்மைப் போந்துஅளியாய் என்றுஎன்று ஏத்தி  
சுடர்கொள் சோதியைத் தேவரும் முனிவரும் தொடர  
படர்கொள் பாம்பணைப் பள்ளிகொள்வான் திருமோகூர்  
இடர் கெடவடி பரவுதும் தொண்டீர்! வம்மினே.

iṭarkeṭa emmaip pōntuaḷiyāy eṉṟueṉṟu ētti

paṭarkoḷ pāmpaṇaip paḷḷikoḷvāṉ tirumōkūr  
iṭar keṭavaṭi paravutum toṇṭīr! vammiṉē.

**English translation of verse 10.1.4:**

Come, ye, devotees, worship we shall offer  
At the Lord’s distress-dispelling feet in Tirumōkūr,  
Where He on the capacious serpent-bed lays  
So as to grant audience unto sages and Celestials,  
Who His resplendent Form adore and many a time utter,  
“May it please You, my Lord, to come down here  
And our ills and evils cure.”

**Notes:**

\(i\) The Āḻvār invites the devout to come and worship the Lord, so easily accessible at Tirumōkūr and get rid of their miseries, *in toto*.

\(ii\) The sages and Celestials approach the Lord, whenever they are brought up against difficulties, and seek relief through Him; the Āḻvār too seeks succour from the Lord and yet, he stands on a different footing from others, in that he seeks not personal gains but eternal service unto the Lord, in keeping with his essential nature of being His exclusive vassal. The Sages of Daṇḍakāraṇya exhibited their emaciated bodies, tormented by the Rākṣasas stalking the forest, to Śrī Rāma and sought from Him. mere restoration of their bodily comforts. In dire contrast to this, Saint Nammāḻvār prayed unto the Lord, right in the opening song of ‘Tiruviruttam’, the first of his four hymnals, to cut out altogether this bedevilled body of hit, full of dirt and disorderly conduct.




## 10.1.5
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

தொண்டீர்! வம்மின் நம்சுடர்ஒளி ஒருதனி முதல்வன்  
அண்டம் மூவுலகு அளந்தவன் அணி திருமோகூர்  
எண் திசையும் ஈன்கரும்பொடு பெரும்செந்நெல் விளையக்  
கொண்ட கோயிலை வலஞ்செய்து இங்கு ஆடுதும் கூத்தே.

toṇṭīr! vammiṉ namcuṭaroḷi orutaṉi mutalvaṉ  
aṇṭam mūvulaku aḷantavaṉ aṇi tirumōkūr  
eṇ ticaiyum īṉkarumpoṭu perumcennel viḷaiyak  
koṇṭa kōyilai valañceytu iṅku āṭutum kūttē.

**English translation of verse 10.1.5:**

Come, ye, devotees, let us sing and dance and go round  
The temple at lovely Tirumōkūr with paddy fields fertile, all around  
And sweet cane crops all over, where dwells with great delight  
The peerless Projenitor with resplendent Form exquisite,  
Our Lord, Who spanned the three worlds of the Universe vast.

**Notes:**

The Lord at Tirumōkūr having attracted the Āḻvār by revealing His glory, as the first cause of all things and beings, and His exquisite Form, the Āḻvār wants to share this extra-ordinary bliss with those around. He, therefore, invites them all to join him, so that they may all go round the temple at Tirumōkūr, dancing in ecstasy.




## 10.1.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கூத்தன் கோவலன் குதற்று வல்லசுரர்கள் கூற்றம்  
ஏத்தும் நங்கட்கும் அமரர்க்கும் முனிவர்க்கும் இன்பன்  
வாய்த்த தண்பணை வளவயல்சூழ் திருமோகூர்-  
ஆத்தன் தாமரை அடிஅன்றி மற்றுஇலம் அரணே.

kūttaṉ kōvalaṉ kutaṟṟu vallacurarkaḷ kūṟṟam  
ēttum naṅkaṭkum amararkkum muṉivarkkum iṉpaṉ  
vāytta taṇpaṇai vaḷavayalcūḻ tirumōkūr-  
āttaṉ tāmarai aṭiaṉṟi maṟṟuilam araṇē.

**English translation of verse 10.1.6:**

Shelter have we none but the lotus feet  
Of our Sire at Tirumōkūr, replete  
With paddy fields and water sheds, cool and bright,  
The divine cow-herd of majestic gait,  
Deadly unto the Asuras who would miseries on others inflict;  
Unto us that extol Him and the Devas, He is sweet indeed.

**Notes:**

\(i\) No doubt, Śiva is famous as the great dancer (Naṭarājaṉ), full of thrills, but Lord Rāma’s very gait is said to have been entrancing—c.f. ‘Agrataḥ *prayayau* Rāmaḥ’ (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa) and equally majestic and enthralling was Lord Kṛṣṇa’s gait.

\(ii\) While the Lord is deadly unto the Asuras who inflict miseries on the devout, He is very dear to His devotees, all alike, making no distinction between the ‘Nitya Sūrīs’ (Eternal Heroes) and the votary just admitted unto His fold. Could there be a greater friend and benefactor than the Lord Who keeps remembering His devotees, all the time, including those last moments of their lives when they remain unconscious and are no better than a piece of stone or log of wood, and conducts them to the highest state (Heaven)?




## 10.1.7
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மற்றிலம் அரண் வான்பெரும் பாழ்தனி முதலாச்  
சுற்றும் நீர்படைத்து அதன்வழித் தொல்முனி முதலா  
முற்றும் தேவரோடு உலகுசெய்வான் திருமோகூர்  
சுற்றிநாம் வலஞ்செய்ய நம் துயர்கெடும் கடிதே.

maṟṟilam araṇ vāṉperum pāḻtaṉi mutalāc  
cuṟṟum nīrpaṭaittu ataṉvaḻit tolmuṉi mutalā  
muṟṟum tēvarōṭu ulakuceyvāṉ tirumōkūr  
cuṟṟinām valañceyya nam tuyarkeṭum kaṭitē.

**English translation of verse 10.1.7:**

All our miseries will, in no time, be gone,  
If we’d only go round Tirumōkūr where stays our Lord,  
Who did usher in the universe vast, water-bound,  
The primordial matter unique, which pleasures do yield  
Of both the worlds, prajāpati, the hoary Sage  
And the worlds peopled by Devas of all grades;  
Other than this hallowed city, haven have we none.

**Notes:**

\(i\) Would it be an exaggeration if the Āḻvār said that there is no Refuge other than the holy city of Tirumōkūr? No, not at all, for there dwells our Lord, the great Benefactor of all times, Who ushered in the entire Universe surrounded by the perepheral waters, pressed into service the Primordial Matter (Mūla Prakṛti) whence spring up things that make people earth-bound, enjoying the sensual pleasures or Heavenbound, as the case may be, propagated the worlds with their colourful varieties through the Four-headed Brahmā, and is thus referred to herein, as the ancient Sage whose mind is deeply absorbed in the great task of creation.

\(ii\) If we circumambulated the holy centre, all our miseries, including our anxiety as to who would guide us in our ascent to Heaven, would vanish in a trice.




## 10.1.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

துயர்கெடும் கடிதுஅடைந்து வந்து அடியவர் தொழுமின்  
உயர்கொள் சோலை ஒண்தடம் மணிஒளி திருமோகூர்  
பெயர்கள் ஆயிரம்உடைய வல்லரக்கர் புக்குஅழுந்த  
தயரதன் பெற்ற மரகத மணித் தடத்தினையே.

tuyarkeṭum kaṭituaṭaintu vantu aṭiyavar toḻumiṉ  
uyarkoḷ cōlai oṇtaṭam maṇioḷi tirumōkūr  
peyarkaḷ āyiramuṭaiya vallarakkar pukkuaḻunta  
tayarataṉ peṟṟa marakata maṇit taṭattiṉaiyē.

**English translation of verse 10.1.8:**

Ye, devotees, all your miseries shall, in no time, disappear  
If you’d come and worship the Tank, studded with sapphire.  
King Tayarataṉ did yield, where the fell Rakṣasas, who bore  
A thousand names, met their inglorious end,  
Our Sire Who dwells in Tirumōkūr, with stately gardens and lovely ponds.

**Notes:**

\(i\) Pond inside the temple at Tirumōkūr as well as outside! The ponds, outside the temple precincts, are studded with lotus while the Lord, enshrined within, looks like yet another such lotus pond, what with His complexion resembling the lotus leaf, His eyes and lips, hands and

feet, looking like the red lotus in fresh bloom. Śrī Rāma, the valiant son of King Daśaratha, is figuratively likened to a tank studded with blue gems (sapphire), the hot bed of destruction of the dastardly Rākṣasas. Tanks are beneficial to those who seek to bathe therein or slake their thirst. There are, however, some who fall into them and commit suicide. It is significant that the Lord did not, on His own, destroy the Asuras and Rākṣasas but they courted disaster and met their ignominious end at the hands of the Lord, like unto the winged caterpillars rushing to the burning lamps and getting roasted to death, in large numbers.

\(ii\) If the Lord earned a thousand names by. virtue of His benevolence, so did the Rākṣasas too, by dint of their cruelty, such as “Yajña Śatru”, “Brahma Śatru” etc.




## 10.1.9
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மணித் தடத்தடி மலர்க்கண்கள் பவளச் செவ்வாய்  
அணிக்கொள் நால்தடம்தோள் தெய்வம் அசுரரை என்றும்  
துணிக்கும் வல்அரட்டன் உறைபொழில் திருமோகூர்

tuṇikkum valaraṭṭaṉ uṟaipoḻil tirumōkūr

**English translation of verse 10.1.9:**

Blest are we with Tirumōkūr, near at hand,  
Our sure haven, with many a lovely garden around,  
Where dwells our mighty Lord, Who the Rākṣasa hordes  
Would ever annihilate, the Supreme One with comely shoulders four,  
With coral lips and lotus eyes, Whose lovely pair  
Of feet are like unto a tank, cool and clear.

**Notes:**

The Āḻvār rejoices that Tirumōkūr, the safe haven, is near at hand. It is a lovely place with a beautiful setting and there dwells the Lord Whose pair of feet are like unto a cool tank, lovely and limpid, Whose eyes are like the red lotus in fresh bloom, and lips are coral red, Whose sinewy shoulders bespeak His enormous strength that can smash to smithereens the Rākṣasa hordes, antagonising Him.




## 10.1.10
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நாம்அடைந்த நல்அரண் நமக்குஎன்று நல்அமரர்  
தீமை செய்யும் வல்அசுரரை அஞ்சிச் சென்றுஅடைந்தால்

**English translation of verse 10.1.10:**

Better learn, my men, to contemplate and reverently utter  
The holy name of Tirumōkūr where stays our Lord to cater,  
Assuming the form of His choice, to the pious Devas that bend  
Before Him frightened by the Asuras who on them miseries land,  
Seeing in Him, the Refuge, safe and sound.

**Notes:**

The Āḻvār invites those that are inclined to listen to him to utter the name of Tirumōkūr and adore that holy centre where stays the great Benefactor, ever ready to extend protection to His devotees, assuming the appropriate Form, at His sweet volition. Well, this is the place where even the Devas come and take refuge, frightened by the formidable Asuras, hell-bent to land them in miseries.




## 10.1.11
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஏத்துமின் நமர்காள் என்றுதான் குடம்ஆடு-  
கூத்தனைக் குருகூர்ச் சடகோபன் குற்றேவல்கள்  
வாய்த்த ஆயிரத்துள் இவை வண் திருமோகூர்க்கு

ītta pattivai ētta vallārkku iṭar keṭumē. (2)

**English translation of verse 10.1.11:**

The woes shall be gone of those that chant these songs ten,  
Assigned to Tirumōkūr, from out of the thousand of Caṭakōpaṉ  
Of Kurukūr, composed as a piece of service divine,  
Adoring the Lord Who did the pot-dancing great,  
Inviting the pious on-lookers to sing His glory with all their might.

**Notes:**

\(i\) These ten songs have been doled out to Tirumōkūr, out of the thousand composed by the Āḻvār, in adoration of  
Lord Raṅganātha, the cloud-hued Lord enshrined in the walled city of Srirangam, Vide also notes below VII-2-11. The chanters of this decad will be rid of all miseries, including the anxiety to secure a suitable escort, during their ascent to heaven, which is assured to them at the end of the current span of life.

\(ii\) When Lord Kṛṣṇa did the pot-dancing, He exhorted the people around, as follows:

“May those of You that admire my valorous deeds, sing my glory as lustily as your gift of speech can cope with.” This goes to show that the Lord’s deeds were exhilarating unto Him and others alike. Such a Lord is lauded by the Āḻvār through appropriate songs, set in choice diction.
