## 00 Intro8.1
In the last decad, the Āḻvār longed for the pleasure of singing Tiruvāymoḻi before the Divine couple at Tiruvāṟaṉviḷai and rendering unto Them other kinds of service as well. But then, the project did not get off the ground and non-fulfilment of his cherished desire made the Āḻvār grow sceptical of the Lord’s bonafides and His ability to concede the wish of His devotees. This doubt is expressed in this decad.

The Āḻvār feels vexed that he has been thwarted from achieving his desired objective even under the most propitious circumstances. The Divine consorts are beside the Lord, reclining on the serpentbed at Tiruvāṟaṉviḷai, ready to grant him audience and the ‘Nitya Sūrīs’ are also around; the Lord is omnipotent and can easily meet the aspirations of the devotees by assuming any Form, suited to the purpose and on his part, the yearning is much-too-deep. And yet, the Āḻvār could not achieve his objective, giving rise to frustration that casts doubts in his mind as to whether the well-known traits of the Lord such as His readiness to respond to the requests of His devotees, looking upon their woes as His own, in the sense that they are but His modes etc., have become ineffective, because of him. This was precisely how Sītā bemoaned her miserable lot during her captivity in Laṅkā, seriously suspecting Śrī Rāma’s intentions and inclinations towards her. As a matter of fact, the saint, subsist solely on the sweet contemplation of the Lord’s auspicious traits and once this vital communication is cut out, they will just cease to exist. The Lord apprehended that the Āḻvār, sunk in despair under the delusion that the Lord’s auspicious traits have dried up, might collapse altogether and, therefore, set at naught his doubts by calling upon him to ponder over all that He had done for him earlier and assuring Him of the due fulfilment of whatever He intended to do further for him. Thus consoled, the Āḻvār feels elevated from the erstwhile depression.




## 8.1.1
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

**English translation of verse 8.1.1:**

Tirumakaḷ and Mother Earth are Your Consorts Divine,  
(Befitting Your beauty and majesty), the Celestials are Your vassals,  
(Ever ready to do Your bidding) You are the Sovereign  
Of the three worlds, assume You can any Form at wiḷḷ;  
Your lotus eyes and coral lips peerless, however, torment this sinner’s soul,  
Oh, gem of a Lord, dear unto me like life! Nectar insatiable,  
Oh, Sire, You did the surging ocean churn, pray, let me behold you.

**Notes:**

The Lord has revealed Himself before the Āḻvār’s mental vision in all His might and majesty in that glorious setting; the Divine Consorts and the Nitya Sūrīs, who make the supplicant’s position safe and sound by virtue of their good offices, are around; the Lord is the Sovereign Master of all the worlds and apart from the immensity of His wealth, He is omni-potent, He churned the Milk-ocean once and delivered the ‘Amrut’ (ambrosia) to the self-centred and egotistic Devas and in spite of such an extremely favourable background, it is a pity He would not grant the wish of a selfless devotee of the eminence of Saint Nammāḻvār. While this very thought is depressing enough, the dejection gets accentuated when he muses over the Lord’s lotus eyes, coral lips and radiant Form which he could not currently behold. Of course, the Āḻvār doesn’t want the Lord to take, for his sake, the trouble of churning the ocean as He did for the selfish Devas, and all that He prays for is that he might be enabled to behold the Lord’s bewitching Form, so as to sustain himself.




## 8.1.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

காணுமாறுஅருளாய் என்றுஎன்றே கலங்கி கண்ணநீர் அலமர வினையேன்  
பேணுமாறுஎல்லாம் பேணி நின்பெயரே பிதற்றுமாறு அருள் எனக்கு அந்தோ

pēṇuvār amutē! periya taṇpuṉalcūḻ perunilam eṭutta pērāḷā!

**English translation of verse 8.1.2:**

Agitated stands this sinner, tears flooding the eyes,  
(For, many a time did I call you, eager to behold  
Your Form exquisite), many a method did I adopt (which success defied)  
Your grace rests merely on my prattling Your names (bad luck) alas!  
Oh, Lord, You did, as Kākuttaṉ and Kaṇṇan, incarnate,  
You are unto this vassal the fruit of the wish-yielding tree.  
Nectar of the devout, You did redeem, oh, Benefactor great.  
The big Earth from deep waters, cool, may You be visible unto me.

**Notes:**

No doubt, it is the Lord’s grace that makes the Āḻvār cry out for it all the time, till it actually descends on him, without indulging in any kind of aberration, egging him on to self-effort to induce His grace. An irrepressible longing for quick consummation, resulting from inordinate God-love, made an impatient Āḻvār attempt quite a few methods, aimed at acceleration of his union with the Lord but all these proved ineffective. And now, he does nothing more than mentioning the Lord’s names which again is, of course, due tot he Lord’s grace and stamps him out as one apart from the worldlings. But this is not enough and the Āḻvār pines for beholding the Lord’s bewitching Form and he invites Him to appear before him, even as He had come down as Rāma and Kṛṣṇa, in His incarnate Forms, making Himself visible to sages and shepherdesses and the inhabitants of the remote forests. Actually, the Lord has never been apart from Himself nor is He aware of those separated from Him; while the ‘Nitya Sūrīs’ (Ever-free angles) in Heaven, His proximate attendants know no separation from the Lord, the ‘Nitya Samsarīs’, wallowing in worldly life, are totally oblivious of Him and are, therefore, not conscious of their separation from Him. The Āḻvār is the solitary soul, at this end pining for the Lord, unable to bear the pangs of separation from Him.




## 8.1.3
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

எடுத்தபேராளன் நந்தகோபன்தன் இன்உயிர்ச் சிறுவனே அசோதைக்கு

aṭuttatuōr uruvāy iṉṟu nī vārāy eṅṅaṉam tēṟuvar umarē?

**English translation of verse 8.1.3:**

The little one dear as life unto Nantakōpan, the great Treasure-grasper,  
Acōtai’s vicarious Joy personified, the elephant calf of that clan You are,  
Oh, Benefactor great, Who did unto this vassal Your glory reveal,  
An ocean of compassion unto the devout, You tore off with Your nails,  
Avuṇaṉ, the battle-hungry, into halves and yet, now You appear not  
Before me, taking up the Form You deem fit; (should you thus neglect),  
How can devotees like me trust You (as the Protector great)?

**Notes:**

\(i\) The Āḻvār’s enquiry, as above, could either point out to the Lord, how at all His devotees can sustain themselves if He doesn’t oblige them with His sweet presence, the great Elixir of life, but keeps away, as He is doing at present,

or

express the doubt as to how His reputation as the henchman of His devotees, aired through the Scriptures, the Itihāsa Purāṇas etc., with a great deal of fanfare and publicity, could be taken for granted, without the concrete proof thereof, especially when He is keeping aloof from the Āḻvār, despite his passionate longing for His immediate presence.

\(ii\) Nandagopa is aptly referred to, as the great Treasuregrasper inasmuch as the Lord (Śrī Kṛṣṇa) crossed over to him on the very night of His descent into this world. Nanda hadn’t even dreamt of this windfall and yet, the Lord of the Universe, higher than the highest (Para Brahmam), at His sweet volition, courted Nanda’s courtyard, regaling him in a thousand ways, while the luckless Vasudeva had to be contented with a mere glimpse of the Divine Babe, born in the Prison-house, only to get out of it immediately. This makes all the difference between ‘Svagata svīkāra’ (i.e.) courting the Lord as the ‘Means’ and ‘Paragata svīkāra’ (i.e.) the condescending love of the Lord shed on some one of His choice, at His sweet volition. Is there indeed a greater Treasure than the Lord Who resides right inside every one and yet can be enjoyed only by the felicitous few? Nandagopa is, therefore, rightly acclaimed as the great Treasure-lifter, who didn’t have to lift the Treasure, as such, but could enjoy it like one who comes by a fabulous treasure-trove by sheer luck. Even so, the lion’s share of the enjoyment of this great Treasure went to Acōtai (Yaśodhā) who played the mother of the Divine Babe, a role which should have actually been filled by poor Devakī. The bliss enjoyed by Yaśodhā was indeed several times more than that enjoyed by the Celestials in the High Heavens.

\(iii\) *The elephant calf*: A mighty animal though, the elephant meekly submits itself to be tethered to a peg which could be easily uprooted, with but a small jerk of the huge frame of the beast. The Almighty Lord submitted Himself to the yoke of Yaśodhā who tied Him fast to a pounder, as if He was such a helpless pigmy and then, the Gopīs (the damsels of Virundāvan [Vṛndāvana]) would order Him about. Oh, what an amazing submissiveness! The Āḻvār too seems to feel, according to Nampiḷḷai, that the Lord could have as well been directed and controlled by him even as Nandagopa and Yaśodhā did, assuming the ‘vātsalya’ stance instead of following the ‘Master-servant’ relationship, allowing Him to play the overbearing overlord who would not mingle freely with His subjects.

\(iv\) ‘Avuṇaṉ’ is the Tamil word for Hiraṇya whom Lord Narasiṃha tore down, all for the sake of that little lad, Prahlāda. The Āīvār would seem to feel that he is not obliged by the Lord Who did so much for that young chap. The Āḻvār is even led to suspect whether the Lord had hired out all those Sages, Vyāsa, Parāśara etc., to lavish all those epithets on Him, which do not actually fit in with Him, At least to clear up such misgivings lurking in the Āḻvār’s mind, the Lord should appear before him, assuming an appropriate Form.




## 8.1.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

உமர்உகந்துஉகந்த உருவம்நின்உருவம்ஆகி உன்தனக்கு அன்பர் ஆனார்  
அவர் உகந்துஅமர்ந்த செய்கை உன்மாயை அறிவுஒன்றும் சங்கிப்பன் வினையேன்

amarartam amutē! acurarkaḷ nañcē eṉṉuṭai āruyirēyō!

**English translation of verse 8.1.4:**

My Lord, the battle (of Mahā Bhārata) You brought on to quell the cruel armies, spread across, nectar You are unto the  
Celestials, Deadly poison You are unto Asuras and dear life unto me! You assume  
The Form dear unto Your devotees, the wondrous deeds, You perform,  
Endear You unto the devout; this sinner is, however, led to suspect  
Whether all that is said of You is at all correct.

**Notes:**

The Āḻvār hitherto subsisted on the sure and certain knowledge that God subserves His devotees, ready to do their bidding and assume the Forms they devoutly long to enjoy. But his knowledge and faith, in this great trait of the Lord, are getting shaken, in his present state of dejection. The Lord is undoubtedly the repository of innumerable auspicious traits and it is the Āḻvār’s sins, as he puts it, that makes him stand apart from Him and even go to the length of suspecting this unassailable position of the Lord.




## 8.1.5
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஆர்உயிரேயோ அகல்இடம்முழுதும் படைத்துஇடந்து உண்டு உமிழ்ந்துஅளந்த

**English translation of verse 8.1.5:**

You are my life dear, oh Lord! You did create  
The spacious worlds, one and all, pulled them out  
From beneath the waters deep, during the deluge ate  
And later spat them out, the Supreme Lord that You are,  
You spanned the worlds, reposed on the vast sheet of water,  
Churned the ocean once, then bunded it and broke the bund later;  
Could You unto Devas be what they are unto men, oh, great One,  
You, the unique Soul of all the worlds, where shall I attain?

**Notes:**

\(i\) In the preceding song, the Āḻvār would appear to have provoked the Lord into questioning him, how one, so ill-equipped as he, could think of attaining Him and on the top of that, doubt His greatness and bonafides. The Āḻvār’s answer is that he is but the body and the Lord, the life within, whose bounden duty it is to take care of him. There was hardly any question of the body pursuing a path of its own, by way of practising austerity, discipline etc. Actually, it was He who did, from time to time, all that had to be done, by way of creating the worlds, sustaining them within His stomach during the deluge, refunding them later on to their former sistuations [situations?], rescuing the worlds from Mahā Bali, the usurper, by spanning them all, in just three strides, so on and so forth. And then, He lay on the ocean where came the Divine Mother through His churning; He also bunded the ocean to cross over to Laṇkā, to get at the Mother and later demolished the bund, so as to prevent the entry of the Rākṣasas into the mainland.

\(ii\) The humans could subsist on mere food and water while the Devas need ‘Amrut [Amṛta]’ (ambrosia) for their subsistence. If this marks the distance between the mortals and the immortal Devas, well, there is not only that much distance but very much more between the Devas and the Supreme Lord, the ‘Devādi Deva’ and the comparison is thus not on all fours. While the ratio between Man and Deva is a definite quantum, that between the Deva and the Lord would baffle even the wildest imagination and cannot be put in finite terms.




## 8.1.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

எங்குவந்துஉறுகோ என்னைஆள்வானே ஏழ்உலகங்களும் நீயே  
அங்கு அவர்க்குஅமைத்த தெய்வமும்நீயே அவற்றுஅவை கருமமும் நீயே

maṅkiya aṟivām nērppamum nīyē vāṉpulaṉ iṟantatum nīyē.

**English translation of verse 8.1.6:**

My Sovereign Lord, the worlds seven and the deities worshipped therein,  
The rituals unto them performed as well as things in regions beyond,  
All things and beings, subtle or manifest are unto You bound;  
Well, such a one where and how do I attain?

**Notes:**

\(i\) The Āḻvār’s query is how he can, on his own, attain the Lord Who is the Supreme Controller of all the worlds, Agni, Indra and other deities, worshipped by the respective votaries in different climes, the rituals performed, as part of such worship, as well as all things lying in the regions beyond. How can a lame man get on to the top of Mount Meru? The lameness denotes the incapacity to pursue the normal paths prescribed by the Scriptures to get at the Lord. But then, it behoves the Lord, as the Master, who has striven hard all the time for the Āḻvār’s evolution, right up to this stage, to follow it up to the point of final fruition, with no ancillary effort on his part.

\(ii\) As already stated in V-2-8, it is the Supreme Lord Who has set up in different climes the minor deities to receive the homage the votaries pay them and grant them boons. This is reinforced here. The prescriptive rites and rituals offered to these deities actually reach the Supreme Lord Whose agents these deities are, rather His bodies through which He carries out His multifarious functions.

\(iii\) As mentioned in Śloka 17 of Śrī Āḷavandār’s ‘Stotra Ratna’, the Lord’s possessions (Vibhūti) are indeed very vast and immense, comprising, *inter alia*, the numerous Cosmic worlds with all their inner contents and the external multiplicity of layers, each of which is ten times bigger than the immediately preceding one. (yat daśottarāṉyāvaraṇāni yāni ca). The region beyond the seven worlds, alluded to in this song, denotes these external layers.




## 8.1.7
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

இறந்ததும் நீயே எதிர்ந்ததும் நீயே நிகழ்வதோ நீ இன்னேஆனால்  
சிறந்தநின் தன்மை அதுஇதுஉதுஎன்று அறிவுஒன்றும் சங்கிப்பன்வினையேன்  
கறந்தபால் நெய்யே நெய்யின் சுவையே! கடலினுள் அமுதமே அமுதில்  
பிறந்த இன்சுவையே சுவையதுபயனே! பின்னைதோள் மணந்தபேர்ஆயா!

kaṟantapāl neyyē neyyiṉ cuvaiyē! kaṭaliṉuḷ amutamē amutil  
piṟanta iṉcuvaiyē cuvaiyatupayaṉē! piṉṉaitōḷ maṇantapērāyā!

**English translation of verse 8.1.7:**

Sweet as milk fresh-drawn and the ghee that from it ensues,  
You are, my Lord, the very sweetness in ghee, the ambrosia.  
That from the ocean emerged, with its sweet contents,  
The joy that from such sweetness results; the charming Piṉṉai  
You did wed, oh, Gopal, the past, the future and the present  
You do control; this sinner is losing faith in You, even then,  
As the Lord Supreme of all things, near, far and in between.

**Notes:**

The Āḻvār says that the knowledge of the Lord being the Supreme Controller of all things and beings, abiding in all, which sustained him hitherto, is forsaking him now, the sinner that he is. Time, with its triple components of ‘Past’, ‘Present’ and ‘Future’ and all things and beings embraced within its folds, are but the Lord’s modes. The Āḻvār could, therefore, discern the hand of the Lord, in all happenings, at all times. The Lord is the quintessence of all that is delicious, the inner core of sweetness. This sweetness gets heightened manifold, when the Lord is in conjunction with His Divine Consort. The Āḻvār can, therefore, hardly subsist without partaking of such unalloyed and unlimited bliss and yet, in his present state of separation from Him, he is even led to suspect whether all this glory, attributed to the Lord, is at all real or a mere figment of imagination. The doubt expressed by the Āḻvār earlier in this decad, was about the Lord’s capacity to redeem His subjects. There at least, the Lord could escape by putting the blame on the supplicant’s inadequacy, failings etc. But here, the Āḻvār is led to suspect even the basic feature of the Lord, as the all-pervading, inner Controller of all things and beings, said to be but His modes or attributes.




## 8.1.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மணந்தபேர்ஆயா! மாயத்தால்முழுதும் வல்வினையேனை ஈர்கின்ற

**English translation of verse 8.1.8:**

Mighty Gopāla, Piṉṉai, You did wed with love intense,  
Your auspicious traits, in their full complement, tear into halve  
This sinner great, deadly unto the mighty Asuras, You have  
On Your banner Garuḍa, who does on them miseries impose,  
In the Milk-ocean, on the thousand-hooded serpent You repose;  
I and my mind, word and deed are all swayed by You,  
And so, I know not how I can, on my own, worship You.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The Āḻvār would appear to have been pulled up by the Lord as to why he did not even make a formal obeisance to Him. The Āḻvār clears up the position by pointing out that, as one who belongs to Him, lock, stock and barrel, and is wholly dominated by Him, even this formal act of bowing has to be ordained by Him.

\(ii\) The very traits of the Lord, which do sustain the devotees, are proving injurious to the Āḻvār in his present disconsolate state, making his separation from the Lord all the more poignant. The Āḻvār attributes this mental state to his sins. Wounds inflicted by missiles could be cured but not the sickness imposed by the Lord’s traits themselves. The ungodly Asuras are destroyed by the Lord’s weapons but His auspicious traits, strangely enough, torment the devout like Saint Nammāḻvār, as he puts it in this song, splitting him into halves, even as Hiraṇya was cleaved by Lord Narasiṃha.

\(iii\) Ādi-Śeṣa, the Lord’s serpent-bed, can, on his spacious bosom, accommodate the Lord and His Consorts; his thousand hoods spread themselves out and dance with great joy because of his contact with the Lord.

\(iv\) Mind, body and speech of the sentient being are the Lord’s gifts, capacitating the individual for worshipping Him and yet, the Āḻvār could not, on his own, bow unto the Lord, because he and his appendages, the mind etc., are all wholly dominated by Him. This is indeed the farthest limit of self-abnegation, totally objuring the element of self-effort, (Sādhana yogyatā), that is, employing ‘Means’ other than the Lord Himself.




## 8.1.9
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

யானும் நீதானே ஆவதோமெய்யே அருநரகுஅவையும் நீ ஆனால்

**English translation of verse 8.1.9:**

True it is, You are in me as You are in everything else,  
The hell of a life I now eke out is also Yours;  
So then, it matters not whether You grant me heavenly bliss  
Or keep me lingering in this hellish life, full of distress.  
And yet, life here I dread when I do my essential nature realise,  
I beseech you. therefore, oh Lord, seated in the blissful heaven!  
To bless me that I do your lovely feet attain.

**Notes:**

To those gifted with the vision of the Lord’s Universal Form (Viśvarūpa), like Prahlāda and Nammāḻvār, it should indeed be possible to perceive the presence of the Lord everywhere, looking upon Hell and Heaven alike, with perfect mental equanimity. The doubt, therefore, arises why the Āḻvār abhors existence over here and aspires for his ascent to Heaven, exhibiting a distinct predilection for the latter. This song clears up the position in this regard. It is the corroding, rather, the corrupting influence of life in the midst of the worldlings with its potential risk of seriously interfering with his essential nature, as the exclusive vassal of the Lord solely dependent on Him, that scares the Āḻvār and frightens him to such an extent. No wonder, therefore that he longs for his quick ascent to Heaven where the Lord can be served and enjoyed in that transcendent setting, without break and fear of contamination of any sort.




## 8.1.10
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

**English translation of verse 8.1.10:**

With pleasure great, my Soul I have unto You, sold, sure and certain,  
Oh, resplendent Lord, this is indeed in return  
For the unflinching faith in Your feet, You have on me bestowed;  
Shoulders many, crowns in plenty and a vast multitude  
Of lotus eyes and feet many, I see in You, bearing names many.  
My Sire, I know you intend showering on poor me favours many.

**Notes:**

\(i\) Although the Lord has still not obliged the Āḻvār with His presence, the latter is jubilant that he has not been contaminated by the worldlings and the Lord’s lovely feet are unto him what food and raiment are for the worldlings. This is indeed a great favour done to the Āḻvār by the great Lord, who has not only made the Āḻvār abhor and abjure the ways of the world but also look upon the Lord as his Sole Sustainer. What is even more, He has chosen the Āḻvār for singing these hymns of ‘Tiruvāymoḻi’ without giving this special assignment even to sages of the eminence of Vālmīki, Vyāsa and Parāśara or the first three Āḻvārs, a piece of special favour, a great felicity, already acknowledged by the Āḻvār in the earlier decad. For this benefaction, the Āḻvār now seeks to recompense the Lord by offering Him his soul, like unto a father putting his arms round the shoulders of his daughter and giving her away in marriage to the bridgeroom. In the exuberance of his joy, the Āḻvār seems to have coolly overlooked past history in this regard, his own earlier attempt to barter away his soul, thwarted by an almost immediate realisation that he was trying to give away the Lord’s own, under the erroneous belief that it was his own. Well, even as recently as in the eighth stanza of this very decad, the Āḻvār was conscious of the fact that he, his mind, word, and deed were all swayed by Him and that he had nothing to do with these.

\(ii\) Even as the Āḻvār delightfully made a confounded gift of a thing that didn’t belong to him, the Lord received it with great jubilation, as if it did not already belong to Him, beamed with joy and expanded marvellously by way of expressing His great joy, exhibiting thousands of shoulders, crowns, eyes, feet etc. This is on a par with the Kṣatṛya Kings, in exultation over a great turn of events in their lives, sharing their joy with their favourite queens, in amorous company.

**Tamil text and transliteration:**

பெரிய அப்பனை பிரமன் அப்பனை உருத்திரன் அப்பனை முனிவர்க்கு  
உரிய அப்பனை அமரர் அப்பனை உலகுக்குஓர் தனிஅப்பன் தன்னை  
பெரியவண்குருகூர் வண்சடகோபன் பேணின ஆயிரத்துள்ளும்  
உரியசொல்மாலை இவையும்பத்துஇவற்றால் உய்யலாம் தொண்டீர்! நங்கட்கே (2)

**English translation of verse 8.1.11:**

Ye, devotees, salvation we can all attain, reciting these songs ten.  
Out of the choice thousand composed by Kurukūr Caṭakōpaṉ,  
Adoring the peerless Lord of the Universe, of unique grandeur.  
The great Sire of Piramaṉ, Uruthiraṉ and the worthy Master  
Of illustrious sages like Sanaka and the Devas, one and all.

**Notes:**

This end-song epitomises the contents of this decad and avers that those who recite this decad will attain salvation, even though they have been immersed for ages in sensual pleasures, straying away from God-head.

(Piramaṉ=Brahmā; Uruttiraṉ=Rudra)
