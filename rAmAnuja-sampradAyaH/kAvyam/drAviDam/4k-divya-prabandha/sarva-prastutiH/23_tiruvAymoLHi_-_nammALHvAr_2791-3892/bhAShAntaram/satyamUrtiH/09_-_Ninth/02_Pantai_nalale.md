## 00 Intro9.2
The inviolable and eternal bond between us and the Supreme Lord, Who combines in Him the different facets of earthly relationship known to us, was stressed upon in the last decad, incidentally throwing overboard our so-called relationship with all the rest. The Upaniṣads proclaim that the Lord is “All-in-one”, “*Mātā Pitā, Brātā, Nivāsaś Śaraṇam Suhrut gathir Nārāyaṇa*”. Actually, He stays in His ‘Arca’ (iconic) Form, in the pilgrim centre known as Tiruppuḷiṅkuṭi, only to extend to His votaries all the benefits which they could expect from their earthly relations, mother, father, brother etc.

Therefore it is, the Āḻvār now proceeds (mentally of course) to that holy centre, eager to become the recipient of the Lord’s love and attention, the aggregate of all that the numerous relations could bestow. But then, the Lord remained unresponsive, without so much as casting on the Āḻvār His sweet glances, uttering kind words of enquiry and so on. This did not, however, detract front the Āḻvār’s immense faith in Him, as his all. He could certainly await, with all that robust confidence, the descent of the Lord’s grace, the bestowal on him of the Lord's caressing love and attention, if not the same day, the next day or the day after. But what agitated the Āḻvār’s mind, meanwhile, was the manner in which the Lord was reclining in the holy centre, without changing even once, by way of readjustment, the posture assumed by Him right at the start, a very difficult thing indeed! As a matter of fact, the Āḻvār had already echoed his anxiety, rather uneasiness, in this regard, in VIĪI-3-5 and this is but a follow-up. The Āḻvār, closetted with the Lord in the shrine, would now plead with the Lord privately that He should deign to move about, come forward.a few paces in the company of His Divine consorts, greet him with His bewitching smiles and so on. The Āḻvār is thus seeking, in this decad, the benefits accruing from the attainment of the Lord, the final goal, lauded by him, in the preceding decad.

Meaning apart, the diction of this decad is such as to melt even stony hearts. Those of us, who get caught up in the bewildering complexities of family life, will do well to chant this decad and feel relieved and refreshed. How soothing are these verses indeed!

**English translation of verse 9.2.1:**

Oh, Lord, reclining in Tiruppuḷiṅkuṭi whose fields fertile are fed  
By the limpid waters of ‘Porunaḻ’, may You Your grace shed  
On us, by you and (Lakṣmi) the lotus-born, duly blest  
To serve, generation after generation, in Your vicinity sweet,  
And utter from Your radiant lips words nice,  
Casting glances sweet from Your lotus eyes.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The Āḻvār, who seeks refuge in none but the Lord, beseeches Him to quench his God-thirst by addressing nice words unto him and cast His sweet glances on him. While making this prayer, the Saint gratefully acknowledges the influx of the combined grace of the Divine Couple on him, through successive generations, unremittingly engaged in Divine Service. Actually, in strict chronological sequence, it was the benevolent grace of the Divine Mother that was first shed on the Āḻvār, which, in turn, led to the bestowal on him of the Lord’s grace, as well. It is by dint of such grace that the votaries render the appropriate kinds of service in the temples at holy pilgrim centres. Of the various kinds of service one can render, sweeping and cleansing the temple premises, ensuring their tidiness, secure the pride of place. Even Tirukkaṇṇamaṅkai Āṇṭāṉ, about whom there is a striking anecdote, in the esoteric treatise known as ‘Śrīvacana Bhūṣaṇaṃ’, who had given up all bodily activities, persisted in rendering such service. He had, no doubt, entrusted himself to the Lord’s sole keeping and yet, he deemed cleaning the temple premises as an end in itself, for the simple reason that one can easily perceive the difference between an area already cleaned and one yet to be cleaned, purely from an aesthetic point of view.

\(ii\) *Glances from the Lord's lotus eyes*: When Piḷḷai Tevapperumāl Arayar, the temple bard, sang this song in the august assembly in front of Lord Raṅganātha, he went on repeating the phrase, “Turn on me the glances sweet from your lotus eyes”. Pat came the admonition from his father, Āḻvār Tiruvaraṅka Perumāḻ Arayar, as follows: “Why do you, my son, plague the Lord with such plaintive appeals? Has He not blessed you with a sweet voice to chant the sweet canticles of the Āḻvārs? Has He not also bestowed on you enough, by way of riches and children? What more do you want from the Lord so as to pester Him with such meltingly plaintive appeals? Go ahead witty your recital”.

**English translation of verse 9.2.2:**

May You, Oh Lord! reposing in Tiruppuḻiṅkuṭi whose golden walls  
Are with creepers adorned alongside fields and gardens cool,  
Shed your grace on us, your vassals from generations, by You blest  
To cling to Your lovely feet and render service steadfast,  
And may You my head decorate with Your lotus feet,  
Which did once suitably expand and span all the worlds.

**Notes:**

\(i\) While praying unto the Lord at Tiruppuḷiṅkuṭi that He be pleased to place His lotus feet, the safe and easy refuge of one and all, on his head, the Āḻvār expatiates on his steadfast servanthood (śeṣatva), which lends itself to four components, namely, strict adherence to the traditional creed of exclusive service unto the Lord and His devotees, enhancing the family name by enriching the tradition through rare conduct without precedent, rendering service unto the Lord with single-minded devotion, untainted by worldly pursuits and unflinching subservience to the Lord’s will, as distinguished from service rendered at one’s own sweet will. In regard to these components of servanthood, the illustrious author of ‘Ācārya Hṛdayam’ puts the Āḻvār on a par with Bharata. When sage Vaśiṣṭa and the council of Ministers of King Daśaratha wanted to make Bharata, the king, in place of Śrī Rāma sent into exile, Bharata would not agree to it, on the ground that it would mark a daring departure from the established tradition of the Ikṣvāku dynasty whereby only the eldest son wore the crown. It is this traditional sanctity that the Āḻvār also emphasises in this song.

\(ii\) Indeed, Bharata added lustre to the traditional glory by leading the austere life of an ascetic during Rāma’s exile, lying on a bare floor and getting his body smeared with mud and so on. Likewise, saint Nāmmalvār stood with eyes dried and parched-up lips, bailed out, with his palms the torrential tears from his eyes and fell down on the floor, fainting with grief, during those moments of extreme desolation, when the Lord did not favour him with His vision.

\(iii\) No doubt, both Lakṣmaṇa and Bharata served Śrī Rāma and yet, there was a fundamental difference between them. Whereas Lakṣmaṇa would insist that he shall follow Śrī Rāma into exile and serve Him, in every conceivable manner, Bharata’s stance was one of total subservience to Śrī Rāma’s sovereign will. Although his mission of getting Sri Rāma, back home from exile, did not succeed, yet Bharata was happy that he could at least get the Lord’s pair of sandals, as His Regent, to be installed on the throne during His absence from Ayodhya. The Āḻvār claims that he is also made of the same stuff as Bharata and is, therefore entitled to the Lord’s grace. The Āḻvār also invokes the Lord’s pair of feet which, in fact, had been set by Him on one and all, without distinction of high and low, during His Avatāra as the sprawling Tṛvikrama.

\(iv\) As regards the description, in this song, of the pilgrim centre, as one enclosed by scintillating walls adjoining fertile fields and cool gardens, there is a juicy interpretation from Nampiḷḷai, which none but one of his gigantic intellect could conceive. The grief of Sītā, in captivity, was two-fold, namely, (i) melancholy due to her misgivings about Śrī Rāma’s intention in regard to redeeming her, in view of the enormous lapse of time and (ii) dejection due to separation from her Lord. The first vanished on her meeting Hanumān. So also, the Āḻvār’s dejection falls into two distinct compartments, namely, (i) apprehension of the possibility of anything untoward happening to the Lord reclining in this land of dark nescience and (ii) inability to mingle with the Lord to his heart’s fill. The first part of the Āḻvār’s disquietude gets eliminated by the stately walls enclosing the holy place and what remains is the second for allaying which the Āḻvār makes the prayer, as in the third line of this song.

**English translation of verse 9.2.3:**

How is it, my Lord! You do in Tiruppuḷiṇkuṭi repose  
In one and the same posture ever since You came there,  
Not minding the pain on Your body exquisite? how long more  
Will You in this manner lie? May You shed Your grace  
On us, grown gray in Your service hoary and turn on us  
Your lotus eyes large; may You with Your lotus-born Spouse  
Remain seated so as to be adored by the three worlds spacious!

**Notes:**

\(i\) Having set out, in the two preceding songs, his descent from a lineage of devout men engaged unremittingly in the self-less service of the Lord, the Āḻvār now prays unto Him to concede his wish, as follows: The Lord should rise up and turn His sweet glances on him, be seated along with Mahālakṣmī, so as to take service from him and be incidentally worshipped by the denizens of all the three worlds. It is, no doubt, a matter well within the knowledge of the Āḻvār that the Lord, in His Iconic Form, remains, for all intents and purposes, static, without altering the posture, initially assumed by Him. And yet, the Āḻvār would want the Lord to get up, be seated and so on. Actually, his predecessor Tirumaḻicai Āḻvār had similarly entreated Lord Ārāvamutaṉ, enshrined in Tirukkuṭantai (Kumbakonam, in Tamil Nāḍu) to get up and address a few words to him. However, when, in response, the Lord rose from bed a little, the Āḻvār would not be a party to the Lord disturbing Himself from His much-needed rest and therefore, requested Him to speak without getting up. The Lord is seen there, down to this day, in a posture midway between lying and sitting.

\(ii\) The Āḻvār would appear to have been thinking on these lines: “It is just possible that the Lord in Tiruppuḷiṅkuṭi assumed the lying posture, in response to the request of an ardent devotee. And now, the Āḻvār finds that the Lord has been lying in the same posture far too long, much to His discomfort, and very much wishes that He should certainly readjust the posture, so as to secure physical relief, the more so, when a request to this effect is made by a devotee of his calibre.” Did not Āṇṭāḻ and her confreres request Lord Kṛṣṇa to get up from bed and walk down to the drawing room to grant them audience, duly seated on the throne?

**English translation of verse 9.2.4:**

You did unto me clarity impart and would from me never depart,  
Oh, my Master, reposing in Puḷiṅkuṭi. You remain seated  
In Varakuṇamaṅkai and in Vaikuṇṭam You keep standing,  
May You unto me shed Your grace cool that shall astound  
The worlds three and make us dance with joy, let us also behold  
Your bewitching fruit-like lips like unto the coral creeper  
That entwines the dark cloud, laden with limpid water.

**Notes:**

\(i\) In His iconic manifestation, the Lord assumes different postures; in certain pilgrim centres, He reposes, in some, He is seen seated, while, in others, He keeps standing. These can be adored individually as well as collectively, as in this song. As Saint Nammāḻvār contemplated on the manifestations of the Lord, in His worshippable Forms, at the various pilgrim centres, certain special aspects and attributes of the Lord presented themselves to him, forming the subject-matter of his meditation, in each centre. Thus, these three holy places, jointly mentioned here, throw light, according to the illuminating author of “Ācārya Hṛdayam”, on the three progressive stages of God-love, known as “Para Bhakti” “Para Jñāna”, and ‘Parama Bhakti’.

Having endowed the Āḻvār with clarity of thought, shorn of doubt, discrepancy and deviation (8-8) and kindled in him God-love of rare magnitude, the Lord is now nestling round him in various postures, eager to get hold of him at the pinnacle of his devotion (parama Bhakti). The Lord is in the same predicament, as one, with pinching hunger, moving impatiently, in and around the kitchen where food is being cooked, vide aphorism 177 of ‘Ācārya Hṛdayam’.

\(ii\) It will certainly astound the denizens of the three worlds when they see that the Lord has responded to the entreaties of the Āḻvār and come out of His repose; the Āḻvār and the fellow-devotees will bubble with joy and dance, on seeing the Lord’s bewitching smiles from His radiant, red lips.

**English translation of verse 9.2.5:**

My Lord, You do, in lovely Tiruppuḻiṅkuṭi, repose,  
On the bank of Porunal where converge conches in plenty,  
The bird (Garuḍa), who unto Your enemies is hostile, You rode  
And rushed to the pond to rescue the elephant hefty;  
May You deign to come a few paces, for me to behold  
The smiles that play on Your coral lips which do hold  
Your sparkling teeth, moon-like and Your lotus eyes, big and bold.

**Notes:**

The Āḻvār prays that the Lord be pleased to appear before him, even as He had presented Himself to Gajendra, the elephant in great distress, in response to his call for help. As the Lord paces in front of him, the Āḻvār would like to behold the Lord’s sweet smiles, playing gently on His coral lips and the lovely pair of lotus eyes.




## 9.2.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

**English translation of verse 9.2.6:**

Your terrific anger destroys your enemies, oh, Sire,  
The irate bird you rode, like unto the rain-cloud,  
Perched on a mount of gold and the raging demons quelled;  
The radiant crown you don and in your hands do bear  
The weapons hot to cut out all my ills, oh, Lord,  
May you, Who, in Tiruppuliṅkuṭi, have taken up abode,  
Amid fields fertile, let me your lotus eyes behold.

**Notes:**

Apprehending that the lack of response from the Lord to his entreaties, in the earlier songs, might be due to his dense sins, the Āḻvār point out to the Lord that He, who destroyed the powerful demons, Māli, Sumāli and others who preceded Rāvaṇa, should have no difficulty in destroying his sins. If the Lord’s anger unto His enemies is deadly, Garuḍa, His mount, is even more hostile towards them and so are the Lord’s weapons, conch, discus, mace, sword and bow, all of them breathing fire.

**English translation of verse 9.2.7:**

My ills you did cut out and me Your vassal made  
And so do You unto the Celestials as well, my Lord;  
In lovely Tiruppuliṅkuṭi You repose, in whose cool waters  
The red lotus blooms with petals nice, may You remain seated  
Just one day, so that your devotees do revel  
And we thereupon rejoice and the duds on Earth behold you, as well.

**Notes:**

The Lord, Who is reposing in cool Tiruppuḻiṅkuṭi, is the Universal Saviour Who extends protection not only to the frail humans over here, in this land of dark nescience, but also to the hefty, head-swollen denizens of the upper worlds. The Āḻvār entreats the Lord to walk down to where he is, the tamarind tree in Āḻvār Tirunakari, or at least get up and remain seated. “Just for a day” should not be taken literally; it is like a man, in deep thirst, asking for water just to moisten his parched-up lips or a person wanting merely to have a glance of something hidden, which he longs to see. Certainly, on seeing the object longed for, he would want to embrace it and do things of that sort. In the process, the Āḻvār would also like to watch and enjoy the jubilation of the Lord’s devotees besides giving a chance to the men of the world, caught up in worldly pursuits, to behold the Lord in the altered posture and appreciate His gracious gesture, betokening his fellow-feeling.

Oh, Lord, You repose in Tiruppuḷiṅkuṭi whose castles tall

May You right here remain seated, in front of us all,  
For a day at least, for the worldly men to pray in tones resounding  
And prostrate with love intensified, vying with each other.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The Lord is known to remain seated in the Durbar hall in the high Heavens, where He grants audience. The

Āḻvār would, however, pray unto the Lord, reclining in Tiruppuḷiṅkuṭi, to appear like-wise, right here, so as to attract the people over here and make them worship Him, to their heart’s fill, in grateful appreciation of His great gesture.

\(ii\) *To pray in tones resounding*:

What really moves the Lord and what He looks for in us, are neither the matter comprised in the hymns we sing in His praise nor even the manner in which we sing them but cordiality and humility in our hearts. Whereas the high class brahmins, swelling with pride over their stature and learning, address the Deity, in their usual accents, high-sounding Sankrit phrases, “Victory unto You” and so on, the so-called low class people praise the Lord, in their simple, unsophisticated, rustic tongue, as follows:

“Dear Lord, do Thou drink milk! do Thou eat Fruit! do Thou wear warm clothes!” and so on.

**English translation of verse 9.2.9:**

Oh, Lord, reposing in Tiruppuḷiṅkuṭi, amid paddy fields fertile,  
Where fishes young wade thro’ water in marshy soil,  
Oh, wielder of weapons which deal on the Asuras blows deadly!  
May You, in this land vast, remain seated stately,  
For us, your vassals, to sing your praise in benedictive hymns  
And for ever drink deep the exquisite charm  
Of your delicate form, like unto flower in fresh bloom.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The Lord, in His boundless grace, has deigned to come to this distasteful land, with all its dirt and devilry, and present His worshippable Form to the householders over here, despite their callous indifference. It is indeed an act of grace galore, on His part, to have condescended, out of sheer love, to make Himself visible to the worldly men, who love all but Him Who really matters. Well, it is in His Arcā (Worshippable) Form that the Lord hangs on, willy-nilly, to the frail mankind and tries to redeem them, at all costs, their indifference notwithstanding, vide also aphorism 38 of ‘Śrīvacana Bhūṣaṇam’.

\(ii\) The Āḻvār has no doubt enjoyed the reclining pose of the Lord at Tiruppuḷiṅkuṭi. And yet, he longs to see Him seated and enjoy the new posture of the Lord, his eyes drinking deep the nectarean Form of the Lord. Śrī Parāśara Bhaṭṭar would say that one can revel in Śrīraṅgam, beholding the Lord in a reclining as well as standing posture and Goddess Raṅganāyakī, in the sitting posture.

My Lord, reposing in Tiruppuḻiṅkuṭi amid fields fertile,  
Your valiant weapons are unto Asuras deadly and do the Devas succour;  
You, my Nectar, may you beckon me or draw unto me near.  
Just one day, that I may stroke your feet tender,  
Your lotus and earth-born Spouses of peerless beauty press gently.

**Notes:**

\(i\) It may be recalled that the gnostic Mother of Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī had referred to the latter, in VI-5-10, as the proto-type of the three Divine Spouses, Mahālakṣmī, Mother Earth and Nappiṉṉai. And now, the Āḻvār requests the Lord that he may be granted an opportunity to massage His tender feet which even His delicate Spouses of matchless charm handle with great care and press gently. For this purpose, the Lord should either beckon the Āḻvār to where He is or come down to his place.

\(ii\) No doubt, the Lord is, according to His own admission and the verdict of the Vedas, absolutely impartial to one and all, bereft of love and hatred to any—“Samoham sarvabhūteṣu nadveṣyośti na priyaḥ.” “Devānām thānavānāñca sāmānyamathi Deivatam” etc. If it is still mentioned here that He is a veritable poison unto the Asuras, unleashing on them His lethal weapons of enormous power and succours the Devas unto whom He is sweet as nectar, there is hardly any contradiction. Did not the Lord bestow His grace and affections on Prahlāda and Vibhīṣaṇa of Rākṣasa clan? Did He not try His utmost to bring round such a heinous offender as Rāvaṇa, who deserved to be slain with a single arrow, even as the far more powerful Vāli was done away with? If the ungodly Asuras rush to their doom, even as the flies get burnt out by the glowing lamp and people fall into tanks, dug for common good and commit suicide, surely, it is no blot on the Lord’s impartiality. Verily, one man’s food is another’s poison. Here then is the Nectar of the Āḻvār, reposing in Tiruppuḻiṅkuṭi, got at without going through the arduous process of churning the deep ocean and all that.

\(iii\) For the fulfilment of his wish, the Āḻvār suggests that the Lord could either send for him or come down to him. In point of relative importance, the Lord’s condescending visit to the Āḻvār is indeed more important than His beckoning the Āḻvār and the two should have been more appropriately mentioned in the reverse order. Nampiḷḷai’s thought-provoking explanation for the present order of mention is that the Āḻvār would prefer being sent for, so that he could witness and enjoy the grand setting in which the Divine Spouses engage themselves in massaging the Lord’s tender feet with meticulous care, a setting, the Āḻvār dared not disturb by making the Lord’s visit to him. as his first choice.




## 9.2.11
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

'கூவுதல்வருதல் செய்திடாய்'என்று குரைகடல் கடைந்தவன் தன்னை  
மேவிநன்குஅமர்ந்த வியன்புனல்பொருநல் வழுதிநாடன் சடகோபன்

ஓவுதல்இன்றிஉலகம் மூன்றுஅளந்தான் அடிஇணை உள்ளத்துஓர்வாரே (2)

'kūvutalvarutal ceytiṭāy'eṉṟu kuraikaṭal kaṭaintavaṉ taṉṉai

**English translation of verse 9.2.11:**

Those that are well-versed in these songs ten,  
Out of the thousand from the sweet tongue of Caṭakōpaṉ,  
Chief of Vaḻutināṭu, where Porunal with water full does run,  
Who supplicated the Lord, who did the roaring ocean churn,  
Either to beckon him or unto him come down,  
Whom the Lord did graciously oblige and sustain,  
Will for ever meditate upon the feet of the one.  
Who once did all the three worlds span.

**Notes:**

The Lord, who exerted Himself a lot to meet the aspiration of the self-centred Devas and got them ambrosia from the depths of the Milk-ocean, will certainly fulfil the wishes of the selfless devotees like the Āḻvār. The chanters of this decad will also be capacitated to enshrine the Lord’s pair of feet in their hearts and meditate on them, without intermission.
