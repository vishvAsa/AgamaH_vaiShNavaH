## 00 Intro10.3
The Āḻvār, who longed, in the preceding song, for the felicity of divine service unto the Lord at Tiru-Aṉantapuram, accompanied by the pious band of Śrī Vaiṣṇavas, was struck down by a deep sense of frustration, when his aspiration did not materialise. So deep was his frustration indeed, that it led him to suspect the frightful possibility of the Lord perpetuating his bondage and prolonging his stay in this abode. Of course, such an apprehension is not out of place, when one sees the notoriety of the material contact (body), with its great potentiality for mischief, on the one hand, and the Lord’s unbridled independence (Svātantarya), on the other. The Āḻvār, however, expresses his apprehension, in an indirect way in this decad, instead of putting it to the Lord point-blank. He cloaks his own misgivings by referring to the misgivings, entertained by the shepherdesses of Virundāvan, who started nagging Kṛṣṇa, the naughty cow-herd boy, even in the early hours of the morning, the pre-dawn period. No doubt, He was still lying in bed on the crucial morning but He used to leave his bed, by about this time, and take the cattle out for the pasture. The same sequence prevails this morning also, that is, the cool breeze is blowing, the Koels have started cooing, the peacocks are strutting about and the herds of cows and calves are seen spread out, all over the place. So great is His loving care for the Cattle that He would surely follow and tend them, relegating to the background His concern for the Gopis who cannot, however, brook His separation, even for a short while. And so, the Gopīs conclude that Kṛṣṇa would not make any exception on this particular morning and stay behind. Their minds get agitated over the certainty of Kṛṣṇa’s departure from their midst, to such an extent that they start experiencing the pangs of separation even when He is very much by their side. One of them would lustily plead with Him that He shall not leave them and go out into the fields, firstly, because they cannot bear being apart from Him for a whole day, which actually looms like ages in their aching minds, and secondly, because of the lurking danger to His life at the hands of Kaṃsa’s evil spies and agents who keep on masquerading, in one form or another, all over the place.

This decad, however, ends on a jubilant note, with a sense of clarity induced by the Lord’s assurance to the Gopīs that He shall not depart from their midst. He tells them: “What indeed is the amazing extent of your love for Me! You should pine for Me, only when I am away from you but I am still by your side”. So saying, the Lord casts His bewitching smiles on the Gopīs, in token of His appreciation of the exuberance of their love for Him. Reference to the red lips, sporting this smile which is quite reassuring, is made in the tenth song of this decad. With this assurance, the Āḻvār’s misgivings also stand cleared up, a clarity induced by the Lord Himself.

If our ancient preceptors referred to IX-9, as ‘Evening brawl they did label this decad, as ‘Morning squabble’.




## 10.3.1
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வேய்மரு தோள்இணை மெலியும் ஆலோ! மெலிவும்என் தனிமையும் யாதும் நோக்காக்

**English translation of verse 10.3.1:**

Alas! my bamboo-like arms have thinned down,  
Lean and lonely am I but You take no note of it;  
The pretty koels coo and the peacocks strut about,  
If you’d the cattle follow for grazing and remain  
Away from us a whole day, it looks a thousand aeons,  
Your lotus eyes do our minds attract and oppress,  
Surely, Oh, Kaṇṇā, You shed not your grace on us.

**Notes:**

The Koels coo the love-songs and the peacocks are seen strutting about; Kṛṣṇa is still in bed, but He is sure to leave shortly for the grazing fields, along with the cattle, and the prospect of separation from Him, a little hence, is so dreadful that the Gopīs have already begun to feel the pangs of separation, as if Kṛṣṇa has already left. It is a terrific gloom that has descended on the Gopīs; the arms, that would gladly embrace the Lord, have already lost their vitality and thinned down. They cannot brook separation from Him, even for a trice, which looms like a whole Yuga, in their eyes c.f. ‘thṛḍi yugāyate tvāmapaśyathāṃ’ (Gopikā Gītā). Well, Kṛṣṇa tells them that He is very much by their side and yet, they fancy that He has already left and, after all, He will be back home in the evening. But the day is too long a wait and it looks drawn out, as far as ages. The Lord is by-no-means insensitive to the exuberance of love of His girl-companions, and, overawed by the enormity of their love for Him, He casts His bewitching looks at them, which again torment them in the present context. No wonder then, that, in their present irreconcilable mood, the love-intoxicated damsels dub Kṛṣṇa, as one totally devoid of grace.




## 10.3.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

**English translation of verse 10.3.2:**

Oh, Kaṇṇa, indeed You are devoid of grace;  
When my breasts are locked in Your sweet embrace,  
Every moment is a spate of bliss which soars  
Much beyond the skies and my sense it blurs;  
But then it passes like a dream and does my desire induce,  
Which thro’ the vital pores of my life does pierce  
And far exceeds the potential of my soul, alas!  
Lest you should from us be apart, every now and then,  
Desist You should from grazing the cows, please listen.

**Notes:**

\(i\) Just to placate the love-intoxicated Gopīs, Śrī Kṛṣṇa repeatedly embraced them. Pleasurable in the extreme though, it only aggravated their misery, as they were tormented by the almost immediate prospect of separation from Him. It is this grief that is voiced forth now.

\(ii\) Finding that attempts, made by Him to pacify the Gopīs, have only intensified their grief, He asks them what exactly they want Him to do. Pat comes the request from them that He should no more follow the cattle to the grazing meadows and leave them alone.

**English translation of verse 10.3.3:**

When into the fields the cattle You follow, my life shall be gone,  
The hot sigh of grief burns out my Soul,  
Companion have I none but I keep lingering still,  
I see not the movement of Your form of collyrium complexion,  
When you are away, the day looks like ages drawn,  
Tears swell up my eyes, may these lowly ones,  
Born as shepherdesses in this clan,  
Be rid of the pangs of separation!

**Notes:**

\(i\) *Kṛṣṇa*: “You, girls, want me to stay at home all the time, but how can I do so, without discharging my duty, as a shepherd, namely, tending the cattle?”

*Gopī*: “Could you, in the discharge of your so-called duty, kill us? Killing women is even more heinous than slaying men. Separation from you means certain death for us and perhaps, You, who slew Thāṭakā and Pūthanā, do not mind killing us, as well. You would surely realise our plight if you did but once behold your exquisite form, standing in front of a mirror”,

\(ii\) “*Companion have I none*”: “Our unique guide, friend and companion that you are, You do not oblige us with your company; my mates are withering away like me while the Koels and peacocks are out to kill me.”

\(iii\) “*I keep lingering still"*;: When the Lord is away, the Gopī just lingers behind, worn-out and emaciated. It was Lord Kṛṣṇa’s presence, by his side, that crowned Arjuna with fame and victory. But after the Lord went back to the Celestium, poor Arjuna, the famous archer, who was known to wield Gāṇḍīva, the bow, with great ease and success, could not even lift it and fared miserably in an encounter with some robbers. The ambidexter, that he was before, he has now lost the power of his arm with Lord Kṛṣṇa no more by his side.

\(iv\) “*Let us be rid of the pangs of Separation*”: The Gopīs display the same ingenuity as Sāvitri did. When asked by Yama to demand anything except handing back Satyavān to her, Sāvitri outwitted Yama by making him grant her the boon of begetting a hundred sons through Satyavān, regaining her husband, Satyavān, in the process. Even so, the Gopī tells Kṛṣṇa: “It is up to you to graze the cows or stay at home. I don’t want to impose any condition and all that I want is that we, damsels, born in this clan of Yours, should be rid of separation from You”.

**English translation of verse 10.3.4:**

Oh, Kōvintā, You think not of the loneliness of we, lowly ones  
And the pangs we suffer when you from us depart;  
Tend you do the cows in Your yard and us You desert,  
From Your lips, like unto a red fruit, words do run,  
Sweet like nectar, pure and seasoned, and go deep down  
This sinner’s heart; alas! these are but hollow,  
Whenever we think of it, our spirits are bathed in sorrow.

**Notes:**

Lord Kṛṣṇa tried to disabuse the Gopīs, by saying: “My darlings, is there such a thing as my departing from Your midst and even if I am away, for a while, can I forget You, for a moment? I am very much alive to your overwhelming love for me and if at all I take the cows out. to the pastures, it is because I am duty bound to do the work assigned to me, by my parents. But be sure, it is only my body that is away from you, while my spirit always abides in you”. Sweetsounding though, the girls take these words with but a pinch of salt. They do not assess Kṛṣṇa’s assertions and assurance at their face value. Apprehending that it is mere eye-wash, they feel terribly agitated.




## 10.3.5
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

**English translation of verse 10.3.5:**

Your soothing words put our hearts in jitters  
As we recollect them Oh, Kaṇṇā, You did the cows go after  
The whole day; the evening has arrived with gusto great  
And it does the fragrance of Jasmine, in full bloom, waft,  
Let my comely breasts enjoy the lavender scent on Your winsome chest  
And my lips the nectar from yours, put Your lovely lotus hand  
On our lowly heads and affirm, the cows You’d no more tend.

**Notes:**

Even when Kṛṣṇa is by their side, the Gopis say that He has gone already to the grazing meadow. What is even worse, they fancy that He has teen away from them for a whole day and it is evening already, with its characteristic environments. In their exuberance of love, they find what actually is the early morn, transposed into the evening with the chill breeze, laden with the fragrance of the jasmine. No wonder, they now pass through all those pangs experienced by them, in IX-9 ante. The sudden appearance of the evening breeze, cruel and tormenting, is likened to Rāvaṇa, come in the disguise of a hermit, before Sītā at Pañcavaṭi-Finding the Gopi in such a plight, Lord Kṛṣṇa asks her what exactly He should do by her and her reply is, as in the last three lines of this song. Śrī Kūrattāḻvāṉ’s “Manmūrti hantha! karapallava thallajamte Kurvan Kathā Kṛtamanoratayiṣyase mām”, in his “Śrīvaikuṇṭa Sthava”, is the exact reproduction of “put your lovely lotus hands on our lowly heads”, occurring in this song.




## 10.3.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

**English translation of verse 10.3.6:**

Oh, Kaṇṇā, the lovely-eyed! put your pretty hand on our lowly heads,  
May be that where You go, many a lady, dear unto you, might hold  
And massage Your lovely feet, but we, at this end, cannot contain  
Our feminity and endure, tears well up like a fountain  
In our eyes sharp, our minds are under tension great  
And therefore even for a moment You shall not from us be apart;  
Your grazing the cows can on us work havoc great,  
Our spirits thaw down like unto wax on fire set.

**Notes:**

The Gopīs insist that Kṛṣṇa shall not go after the cattle but stay behind, seeing that they just can’t subsist without Him. While their spirits will get burnt out like wax, set on fire, their strength of mind is next to nothing and cannot, therefore, avert the catastrophe. Whereas there may be many a girl of comely shape to attend on Him when He is away from them, He is unto the Gopīs, their sole Sustainer and without Him they cannot subsist.




## 10.3.7
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

**English translation of verse 10.3.7:**

The bangles rest not on my wrists nor the saree around my waist,  
Pearls of tears run down my lotus eyes and on my breasts,  
The bloom is gone, my shoulders fade out, Oh, Kaṇṇā of sapphire hue!  
When into the forests, tending the cows with great delight, You move,  
Your delicate red lotus feet aching quite a lot,  
Apprehending the evil Kaṃsa’s agents might on You inflict,  
My spirit burns up as does the wax when on fire set.

**Notes:**

The Gopī sobs out: “Oh, Kṛṣṇa, we, on our part, suffer the pangs of separation from You, what with our thinning down terribly, losing our natural bloom and lustre and so on. But don’t you see that you tread over hill and dale on bare feet, feet which are too delicate to be pressed even by our soft hands, aching a great deal? What is even worse is the route you follow, leaving it all to the whimsical cows that lead you on to fields, far and wide, thereby exposing You to Kaṃsa’s nefarious agents who are out to destroy You. Every blade of grass, every stone, You tread upon, is Your enemy, in disguise, set on you by the scheming King Kaṃsa”.




## 10.3.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

**English translation of verse 10.3.8:**

With fear does my dear life quiver what unto you might befall,  
When You are away, tending the cattle; You’ll do well  
Not to go behind the cows, Oh, Kaṇṇā, better stay here,  
Leave me not, lest my boundless love for You shall thro’ every pore  
Pierce poor me; I’d rather not mind Your flirting right here  
With those other thin-waisted damsels You love whom You rope  
Thro’ Your lotus eyes, hands and feet and Your silken robe.

**Notes:**

Then Kṛṣṇa retorted that it was not merely a matter of His tending the cows but also His fulfilling His engagements with those other ladies, as the Gopīs had themselves hinted at. Here then is the interesting, rather impressive reply of the Gopī. She says: “All that I want is that You should be right in our presence. As a compromise, I would not even mind Your flirting with those other ladies of your heart, right here. You don’t have to go or send some one to fetch them. Your entrancing looks and Your sweet voice shall bring them unto you, your loving hands shall gather the bashful ones up and your silken robe shall obstruct those, bent down in the exhilaration of your touch and pull them upwards. Well, these constitute the messengers in question. It will suffice if you just put aside your upper garment and expose Your exquisite charm”.

**English translation of verse 10.3.9:**

My Lord, we are not the jealous sort that shall disdain  
Your making love unto others; when you do in their company revel,  
Elated we too shall be; You shall, therefore, refrain  
From grazing the cows, there is also the lurking evil  
Of Kaṃsa’s agents roaming about in forms unknown,  
When You are with them in encounter locked, what will happen,  
Alas! I can’t say; do not follow the cows, unto my advice do listen.

**Notes:**

\(i\) Kṛṣṇa was in no mood to swallow the Gopī’s statement, in the preceding song, that she would allow Him to flirt with other ladies, right in front of her. He thought it was a mere ruse to keep him back, as it was against their grain to suffer gladly Kṛṣṇa making love to other ladies, and that too, in their presence. He put it straight to the Gopī that He couldn’t bring Himself to believe their so-called tolerance and accept their statement, at its face value. The Gopī now avers that the pleasure, derived by beholding the bliss enjoyed by Him in the company of those other ladies, was indeed much greater than what they could have by their union with Him. If the Lord takes greater delight in mingling with those other ladies than with the Gopīs, the latter would also share the Lord’s delight which is paramount. In short, the Lord’s delight is theirs and they have no delight of their own. It is of course a natural failing of any woman, judged by common place standards, to be terribly intolerant of her Lord sharing the connubial love with any other lady. But here, in the case of the Gopis, their God-love transcends their feminity when the latter clashes with the Lord’s own delight which, it may be reiterated, is of paramount consideration. So then, here again is a clear enunciation of the highest moral value, in its crystallised form, vide also II-9, III-3 and VIII-10. These have been juxtaposed in aphorism 211 of Ācārya Hṛdayam.

\(ii\) Kṛṣṇa, however, insisted that He went into the forests to graze the cows, purely as a matter of religious duty and that He had no love-affair with any one on the way, as they apprehended. The Gopīs were sporting enough to accept the Lord’s statement and even so, they could not but emphasise the danger to His life at the hands of Kaṃsa’s aides, as Kaṃsa deployed agents all over the place, capable of assuming, at will, any form by way of eluding Kṛṣṇa, their target. The Gopīs would want Kṛṣṇa to stay back, at least on this ground.

**English translation of verse 10.3.10:**

With lips like red fruit. Oh, gem of our shepherd clan,  
Putting aside Balarāmaṉ, You move about all alone,  
Many a formidable Asura, set upon by Kaṃsa, roams about.  
Terrifying the sages, my blood boils when I think of it,  
My words, alas! may You deign to listen,  
I see You relish grazing cows better than Your stay in Heaven.

**Notes:**

*Kṛṣṇa to Gopīs*: “Your misgivings are totally unwarranted; it is because of your overwhelming love for Me that you entertain such baseless fears. Nothing will happen to Me, be sure”.

*Gopīs to Kṛṣṇa*: “You are so charming, Oh, Kṛṣṇa, that we apprehend evil eyes will cast their spell on you. The Asuras, who stalk the forests, are doubly ferocious, bent upon carrying out Kaṃsa’s sinister designs on You. Even sages are in constant dread of the evil that might befall You. It is a great pity, You choose to move alone, putting aside Your benevolent brother, Balarāmaṉ. As we think of all these, our hearts literally go up in flames”.

*Kṛṣṇa to Gopīs*: “How amazing is your love indeed? Why should You entertain such fears, when I am in Your midst?” So saying, He casts the bewitching spell of His smiles on them.

*Gopīs to Kṛṣṇa*: “You just kill us with your smiles, putting us off the track. We know your irresistible partiality for grazing the cows, an act you relish better than even staying in Heaven. Even on the Yonder side of Heaven, You will carry the pleasant memory of the pastures over here and utter in Your dream, the commands to the cows “ḍīyo, ḍīyo”.

**English translation of verse 10.3.11:**

These songs ten, out of the thousand of Kurukūr Caṭakōpaṉ,  
Reverently offered at the feet of the Chief of shepherd clan,  
The Lord with red lips, fruit-like, the Gopīs’ hymnal outpourings,  
The lusty pleadings of a shepherdess to keep Him back from grazing,  
So that He may with her always remain,  
Shall confer the same benefits as the other decads of this hymnal.

**Notes:**

The Shepherdess in question acts as the mouthpiece of the Gopīs, with her remarkable capacity to plead their cause. Even as the Lord stayed with the Gopīs, in deference to their wishes, He will abide in those that chant this decad. Alternately, this decad is well-matched with the other decads of this hymnal and shall bestow the same results as those decads.
