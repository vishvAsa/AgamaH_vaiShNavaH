## 00 Intro4.4
In the last decad, the Āḻvār rejoiced, over head and ears, in the sweet contemplation of the connubial love subsisting between him and the Lord. The Lord, however, apprehended that the Āḻvār might be swept off his feet and thrown overboard by such exuberance of joy, the overwhelming divine ecstasy jeopardising one’s very existence. As already pointed out, at length, in the preamble to 1-9, He is known to regulate the flow of His grace, consistent with the recipient’s capacity for in-ṭake and He, therefore, brought down the tempo, a little, just to stabilise the Āḻvār’s God-enjoyment. Even this slight diminution, in his erstwhile enjoyment, upset the Āḻvār and reduced him to the plight of Śrī Rāma, during his separation from Sītā. Śrī Rāma is said to have gone about asking the trees, the rivers (east-bound female rivers as well as the west-bound male rivers) and other inanimate objects, about the whereabouts of Sītā. And now, the Āḻvār, transformed once again as Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī, in a state of heavy depression, runs after the objects resembling her beloved Lord, in one respect or another, and things usually associated with Him and the disenchantment brought about, on nearer approach, makes her dumb-founded. This is like a man, dispossessed of his treasure, the money-bag, running about frantically, mistaking, as his own, the bags of others resembling his lost bag.

The Mother comes on the scene once again and relates the pitiable predicament of her daughter and the words she utters. The Mother also reveals her own sad plight, seeing her daughter in great distress. The merciful Lord, however, presents Himself before the Āḻvār, towards the end of this decad (tenth song) and puts the Āḻvār back on his feet.

**English translation of verse 4.4.1:**

Translation

Ye, ladies, with bangles bedecked, thro’ earth, her hands she runs  
And exclaims, it is the one trodden upon by Vāmaṉaṉ,  
The sky she worships with joined palms as Vaikuṇṭam,  
Her Lord’s transcendent abode, and points it to others as well;  
Her mental anguish finds its outlet thro’ tears torrential  
And says she, her Lord is of oceanic hue;  
Unto Him who has my daughter thus entranced, what to do?

**Notes**

\(i\) The Mother tells, as above, those who come and enquire of her about the condition of her daughter, Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī.

\(ii\) *Earth, trodden upon by Vāmaṉaṉ* This kind of glamour for the earth, recalling its association with Vāmana who trod upon it, long, long back, has a parallel in Sage

Viśvāmitra: When Rāma and Lakṣmaṉa accompanied the sage to help him through his yāga, they passed by a nice orchard. On being asked by Śrī Rāma whose it was, the sage replied that it was the Siddhāśrama, where the Lord, as Vāmana, once resided, which the sage was still clinging to fondly, enjoying the scent of the soil.

\(iii\) Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī, pointing to the sky, says that ‘Vaikuṇṭa’, the permanent abode of the Lord is over there. This has a parallel in Śloka 16 of chapter 160 of Vanaparva in Mahā Bhārata, where a few people are said to have had a glimpse of the Heaven, right from the hermitage of Ārṣṭiṣeṇa, the Rāja ṛṣi.

Unable to visualise the actual setting in Heaven, tears come to Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī’s eyes and musing on the Lord’s blue complexion, she says her Lord is of oceanic hue. The mother just doesn’t know how to deal with the situation, whether to ask her daughter to await His arrival patiently or to request Him to come quick and meet her daughter.




## 4.4.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

பெய்வளைக் கைகளைக் கூப்பி 'பிரான்கிடக்கும் கடல்' என்னும்,  
செய்யது ஓர் ஞாயிற்றைக் காட்டி, 'சிரீதரன் மூர்த்தி ஈது என்னும்,  
நையும் கண்ணீர் மல்க நின்று 'நாரணன்' என்னும் அன்னே, என்  
தெய்வ உருவில் சிறுமான் செய்கின்றது ஒன்று அறியேனே.

peyvaḷaik kaikaḷaik kūppi 'pirāṉkiṭakkum kaṭal' eṉṉum,  
ceyyatu ōr ñāyiṟṟaik kāṭṭi, 'cirītaraṉ mūrtti ītu eṉṉum,  
naiyum kaṇṇīr malka niṉṟu 'nāraṇaṉ' eṉṉum aṉṉē, eṉ  
teyva uruvil ciṟumāṉ ceykiṉṟatu oṉṟu aṟiyēṉē.

**English translation of verse 4.4.2:**

Ha! comprehend I can’t the actions of my daughter,  
Angelic little one, reverently joining her hands decked with bangles  
And looking at the ocean as where reposes her great Benefactor;  
Pointing to the Sun with red sheen peerless, she tells  
That is just the complexion of Cirītaraṉ; flooded with tears  
In her languishing eyes, the word Nāraṇaṉ, she always utters.

**Note**

It is because Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī keeps meditating on her Lord of oceanic hue that the bangles could be sustained on her wrists, despite her separation from her beloved. It is now night and nothing is visible. The pensive Nāyakī with joined palms, however, hears the roaring noise of the oceanic waves and instantly envisions her Lord of oceanic hue, with her mind’s eye, and says, it is the place where her Lord reposes. It could also be that she was recalling Śrī Rāma languishing before the ocean, without food, in order to get at Sītā.

And now, the Sun has risen and there is the visible Sun, unlike the ocean which she could only muse upon the previous night, without actually seeing it. The Sun reminds the Nāyakī of the conjunction of the Lord and Lakṣmī, like unto the combination of the gem and its lustre. Did not Sitā tell Rāvaṇa that she was but the sheen of Rāma, the Sun and that she could not be separated from Śrī Rāma? Śrī Rāma also echoed the same sentiment, later on. The Nāyakī is too feeble to mouth the word ‘Nārāyaṇaṉ’, in full and merely mutters the incomplete word ‘Nāraṇaṉ’.




## 4.4.3
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அறியும் செந்தீயைத் தழுவி 'அச்சுதன்' என்னும்மெய்வேவாள்,  
எறியும்தண் காற்றைத் தழுவி 'என்னுடைக் கோவிந்தன்' என்னும்,  
வெறிகொள் துழாய் மலர் நாறும் வினையுடையாட்டியேன் பெற்ற  
செறிவளை முன்கைச் சிறுமான் செய்கின்றது என் கண்ணுக்கு ஒன்றே?

aṟiyum centīyait taḻuvi 'accutaṉ' eṉṉummeyvēvāḷ,

ceṟivaḷai muṉkaic ciṟumāṉ ceykiṉṟatu eṉ kaṇṇukku oṉṟē?

**English translation of verse 4.4.3:**

This fell-sinner’s little daughter, whose wrists are with bangles packed,  
Clasps the blistering flame red, saying it is Accutaṉ, her Lord  
But remains unhurt; the chill wind that blows she does embrace,  
Saying it is Kōvintaṉ, her Sire, and acquires the sweet fragrance  
Of the tuḷaci on His person; many a thing like this do I witness!

**Notes**

\(i\) The flamboyance of the Lord’s person is referred to, as a bundle of brilliance. And so, the Nāyakī embraces the red flame with the same avidity with which she would embrace the Lord and because of her sincerity, she does not get blistered, even as Prahlāda was not scalded by fire and remained unscathed.

\(ii\) The cool, southerly breeze is unto the Nāyakī, like Kṛṣṇa, back home in the evening after tending the cows, coming towards her for a sweet embrace. Locked in the Lord’s embrace, in the form of the cool breeze, the Nāyakī acquires the sweet fragrance of the tuḷaci on the Lord’s person. (It is well known that fire blisters the common man while even the cool, southerly breeze has a blistering effect on the lover during moments of separation from her beloved. From what the mother has seen of the Nāyakī, she does not fall in either category—inscrutable indeed are her ways.




## 4.4.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஒன்றிய திங்களைக் காட்டி 'ஒளிமணி வண்ணனே' என்னும்  
நின்ற குன்றத்தினை நோக்கி நெடுமாலே! வா 'என்று கூவும்,  
நன்று பெய்யும் மழை காணில் நாரணன் வந்தான் என்று ஆலும்,  
என்று இன மையல்கள் செய்தான் என்னுடைக் கோமளத்தையே?

oṉṟiya tiṅkaḷaik kāṭṭi 'oḷimaṇi vaṇṇaṉē' eṉṉum

eṉṟu iṉa maiyalkaḷ ceytāṉ eṉṉuṭaik kōmaḷattaiyē?

**English translation of verse 4.4.4:**

Says my tender daughter, love-intoxicated, pointing to the full Moon bright,  
“Ha! my lustrous Lord of sapphire hue,”; beckons she the mountain high,  
Saying, “Come, oh, Neṭumāl,”; beholding the rain-clouds fine,  
She exclaims, “Nāraṇaṉ has come.” and dances with great delight.

**Notes**

The Moon is said to have emerged from the Lord’s mind: The Moon is cool and exhilarating like the Lord and hence, Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī looks upon the Moon as the Lord Himself. The well-grown mountain, tall and majestic, reminds the Nāyakī of the tall Trivikrama, who measured the worlds. Nañcīyar puts it admirably that the Lord fights shy of coming to the Āḻvār straight, weighed down by a clogging sense of default and puts a cloak on His head. The green grow th on the mountain-tops corresponds to this cloak and the Nāyakī now beckons the Lord, in the shape of the mountain, to come and shake off all reserve.

The water-laden cloud is taken to be the Lord Himself, and the Nāyakī dances with joy even as the peacock does, in rapturous delight, at the sight of the rain-cloud.




## 4.4.5
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கோமள வான் கன்றைப் புல்கி கோவிந்தன் மேய்த்தன' என்னும்,  
போம் இள நாகத்தின் பின்போய் அவன் கிடக்கை ஈது என்னும்,  
ஆம் அளவு ஒன்றும் அறியேன் அருவினையாட்டியேன் பெற்ற,  
கோமள வல்லியை மாயோன் மால் செய்து செய்கின்ற கூத்தே.

kōmaḷa vāṉ kaṉṟaip pulki kōvintaṉ mēyttaṉa' eṉṉum,  
pōm iḷa nākattiṉ piṉpōy avaṉ kiṭakkai ītu eṉṉum,  
ām aḷavu oṉṟum aṟiyēṉ aruviṉaiyāṭṭiyēṉ peṟṟa,  
kōmaḷa valliyai māyōṉ māl ceytu ceykiṉṟa kūttē.

**English translation of verse 4.4.5:**

My daughter, like the tendril young, has a hearty hug  
At the young calves hefty, saying these are the ones  
Tended by Kōvintaṉ; she runs after the crawling cobra young,  
Saying that it is her Lord’s bed; what the wondrous Lord means  
To do with her, I, the incurable sinner, know nothing.

**Notes**

\(i\) More than tending the cows, Śrī Kṛṣṇa was fond of looking after the calves, the young ones, unable to look after themselves. This only indicates the special care, bestowed by the Lord on the weaker subjects.

\(ii\) Least afraid of the poisonous cobra, Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī would run after it, with the alluring affinity that it is the Lord’s bed. The Mother stands perplexed, not knowing to what lengths such things might go.




## 4.4.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கூத்தர் குடம் எடுத்து ஆடில் 'கோவிந்தன்ஆம்' எனா ஓடும்,  
வாய்த்த குழல் ஓசை கேட்கில் 'மாயவன்' என்று மையாக்கும்,  
ஆய்ச்சியர் வெண்ணெய்கள் காணில் அவன் உண்ட வெண்ணெய் ஈது என்னும்,  
பேய்ச்சி முலை சுவைத்தாற்கு என் பெண்கொடி ஏறிய பித்தே!

kūttar kuṭam eṭuttu āṭil 'kōvintaṉām' eṉā ōṭum,  
vāytta kuḻal ōcai kēṭkil 'māyavaṉ' eṉṟu maiyākkum,  
āycciyar veṇṇeykaḷ kāṇil avaṉ uṇṭa veṇṇey ītu eṉṉum,  
pēycci mulai cuvaittāṟku eṉ peṇkoṭi ēṟiya pittē!

**English translation of verse 4.4.6:**

Whoever does the pot-dance, my creeper-like daughter  
Takes him to be Kōvintaṉ and runs after;  
The sweet sound of the flute, when she hears,  
Thinks she of her wondrous (Kaṇṇaṉ) and goes into raptures;  
The butter she beholds in shepherdesses’ hands, she avers  
Is the same as that He ate; ha! she is over head and ears  
In love with Him that sucked (unto death) the breast of the demoness.

**Note**

No doubt, during the Lord’s avatāra as Kṛṣṇa, He partook of the community life and excelled in pot-dance. But that was long, long ago. But any one doing this dance as a piece of public show for eking out his livelihood, is mistaken by Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī for Kṛṣṇa and she runs after the performer, despite the clarification furnished by the people around. The sweet strain from a wayfarer’s flute electrifies the Nāyakī who sees in it Kṛṣṇa Himself, who was known to go round the Gopīs, playing on His enchanting Flute meaningful songs, meant to placate the frustrated ones among them, by vindicating His position. If a shepherdess brought butter for sale, the Nāyakī would look upon it as what remained after Kṛṣṇa had consumed. This extraordinary fascination for Kṛṣṇa, on the part of the Nāyakī, is said to be an expression of her gratitude for Him for having killed, as a mere babe, the treacherous Pūthanā, the imposter of a mother. The Nāyakī thinks that the Lord survived the ordeal, only for her sake.




## 4.4.7
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஏறிய பித்தினோடு எல்லா உலகும் கண்ணன் படைப்பு என்னும்,  
நீறு செவ்வே இடக் காணில் நெடுமால் அடியார்' என்று ஓடும்,  
நாறு துழாய் மலர் காணில் நாரணன் கண்ணி ஈது என்னும்,  
தேறியும் தேறாதும் மாயோன் திறத்தனளே இத் திருவே.

ēṟiya pittiṉōṭu ellā ulakum kaṇṇaṉ paṭaippu eṉṉum,  
nīṟu cevvē iṭak kāṇil neṭumāl aṭiyār' eṉṟu ōṭum,  
nāṟu tuḻāy malar kāṇil nāraṇaṉ kaṇṇi ītu eṉṉum,  
tēṟiyum tēṟātum māyōṉ tiṟattaṉaḷē it tiruvē.

**English translation of verse 4.4.7:**

My daughter, in the mould of Tirumakaḷ, knows naught  
Besides the wondrous Lord, be her mind agitated  
Or clear; well under the spell of God-love, she says,  
“All the worlds are but Kaṇṇaṉ’s creation.”; she goes  
After those who, on their foreheads, apply the ash  
Vertically, as Neṭumāl’s votaries; when she sees  
A fragrant tuḷaci garland, “This is Nāraṇaṉ’s.” she says.

**Notes**

\(i\) The world might find the Nāyakī excited, being out of the ordinary run, but she is absolutely clear, so far as God-head is concerned. Actually, she knows nothing else. Even in her present state, she is voicing forth effortlessly, the Vedic truths delved into, by the great ‘Brahma-Jñānīs’ like Sage Parāśara. This is like a Vedic scholar reciting the Vedas even during mental aberration.

\(ii\) The Āḻvār is well aware that ash is eschewed by the votaries of Lord Viṣṇu and yet the vertical application of the ash on their foreheads, by a few, caught in two minds, makes the Nāyakī look upon them also as Vaiṣṇavas (wearing the vertical caste-mark) and go after them. The word ‘nīṟu’, in the original text of this song, need not necessarily denote ‘ash’ (bhasma); it could as well mean the dust off the feet of the devotees of Lord Viṣṇu, as indicated by the use of this very word in IV-6-6.

\(iii\) Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī is said to be an incarnation of Goddess Lakṣmī. Lakṣmī is coveted by the Lord while the Nāyakī covets the conjunction of them both.




## 4.4.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

திரு உடை மன்னரைக் காணில், திருமாலைக் கண்டேனே என்னும்,  
உரு உடை வண்ணங்கள் காணில் 'உலகு அளந்தான்' என்று துள்ளும்,  
கரு உடைத் தேவு இல்கள் எல்லாம் 'கடல்வண்ணன் கோயிலே' என்னும்  
வெருவிலும் வீழ்விலும் ஓவாள் கண்ணன் கழல்கள் விரும்புமே.

karu uṭait tēvu ilkaḷ ellām 'kaṭalvaṇṇaṉ kōyilē' eṉṉum  
veruvilum vīḻvilum ōvāḷ kaṇṇaṉ kaḻalkaḷ virumpumē.

**English translation of verse 4.4.8:**

On seeing the wealthy Kings (of the Earth), says my daughter,  
She has seen ‘Tirumāl’; nice things with gay colours,  
She jumps at, seeing in them her Lord, who did measure  
The worlds; any temple she sees, with idol inside, she adores  
As the temple of her cloud-hued Lord; pines she for ever,  
Kaṇṇaṉ’s feet, be she amorous or in a state of fear.

**Notes**

\(i\) Beholding the earthly kings, the Nāyakī says she has seen her Lord. As the Śāstras put it down, none can become a King without the grace of Lord Viṣṇu. The king is, therefore, said to contain an element of Lord Viṣṇu.

\(ii\) The Nāyakī visualises Lord Trivikrama in all things gay and colourful, and any stone-image in any templelike structure, she looks upon as the Iconic Form of Lord Viṣṇu and His temple respectively. As a matter of fact, salutation made to minor deities also reaches Him, as the Internal Controller of one and all. Indeed, the divine consciousness in her has developed to such an extent that she perceives Divinity in all external objects.

It is said that Saint Nāthamuni once saw a King mounting an elephant, by planting one foot on the head of a subordinate prince standing nearby, and exclaimed: “Well, this is how my universal Lord mounts His vehicle, Garuḍa, stepping on the heads of Brahmā, the demi urge and others”.

During those periods when she is steeped in God-love, the Nāyakī is said to be in an amorous state while, at other times, she is seized with fright, at the sight of the earthly relations around.




## 4.4.9
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

விரும்பிப் பகவரைக் காணில் 'வியல் இடம் உண்டானே!' என்னும்,  
கரும் பெரு மேகங்கள் காணில் 'கண்ணன்' என்று ஏறப் பறக்கும்,  
பெரும் புல ஆ நிரை காணில் 'பிரான் உளன்' என்று பின் செல்லும்,  
அரும் பெறல் பெண்ணினை மாயோன் அலற்றி அயர்ப்பிக்கின்றானே!

perum pula ā nirai kāṇil 'pirāṉ uḷaṉ' eṉṟu piṉ cellum,  
arum peṟal peṇṇiṉai māyōṉ alaṟṟi ayarppikkiṉṟāṉē!

**English translation of verse 4.4.9:**

This daughter of mine, difficult to attain, is made to cry out,  
Mad with love for her wondrous Lord; if ascetics she met.  
She would with devotion exclaim, “Oh, Saviour great,  
Who did the sprawling worlds in your stomach sustain,”  
She would want to leap up to the dark-cloud, dense,  
Saying, “Tis Kaṇṇaṉ, my Lord”; after cows, hefty and nice,  
Run she would, hoping to meet her Lord, the Cow-herd divine.

**Notes**

\(i\) Indeed, Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī is a daughter, rare of attainment, who has enriched the world she lived in, with her lofty thoughts and noble conduct, surcharged with God-love of a unique order.

\(ii\) Seeing the water-laden cloud, the Nāyakī felt that Lord Kṛṣṇa presented Himself before her and she would want to reach Him, high up there. Here is an anecdote to illustrate how devotees felt entranced by the rain-clouds, seeing their likeness to the Lord’s complexion.

Tiruvāykulattāḻvār, a resident of Rājendra Cōḷaṉ,went to the fields during a rainy season to inspect the crops. As he approached the fields, he saw the clouds above, which instantly put into his mind the cloud-hued Lord Viṣṇu. In a fit of ecstasy, he fell down unconscious. One of the cultivators, standing nearby, gathered him up and escorted him to his house. The escort, however, blamed the inmates of the house for having allowed one of such saintly temperament to go out for fieldinspection during the rainy season.




## 4.4.10
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அயர்க்கும் சுற்றும் பற்றி நோக்கி அகலவே நீள் நோக்குக் கொள்ளும்,  
வியர்க்கும் மழைக்கண் துளும்ப வெவ்வுயிர் கொள்ளும் மெய் சோரும்,

**English translation of verse 4.4.10:**

Love-mad, my daughter looks around many a time (for Kaṇṇaṉ)  
And then, she looks far across, with eyes wide open,  
Tears well up her eyes and (disappointed) she sweats and withers down,  
Heaving a deep sigh; even so, Him she fondly beckons,  
‘Kaṇṇā, my Sire,’; what shall this sinner do for her, love-lorn?

**Note**

Unable to get at the Lord in the manner the Nāyakī attempted, namely, running after things bearing His likeness, the Nāyakī, stands dazed. However, in the certain hope that her beloved Kṛṣṇa will go to her, Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī looks around but not finding Him anywhere near at hand, she fancies, He must be on His way, having already left the celestium, bound for her. And, therefore, she strains her eyes to look at Him, coming down from Heaven, and enjoy His majestic gait. But then, she sweats heavily, with disappointment and tears well up her eyes. Withering down, she breathes hot and yet, she couldn’t resist calling out for Him, at the top of her voice, At this stage, due to the exhilaration of reciting the Lord’s names, she fancies that He has come within sight of her mind’s eye and lovingly welcomes Him, saying, “Come along, my Lord,”




## 4.4.11
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வல்வினை தீர்க்கும் கண்ணனை வண் குருகூர்ச் சடகோபன்,

**English translation of verse 4.4.11:**

Those that learn, with devotion great, these songs ten,  
Out of the thousand skilfully composed by Caṭakōpaṉ,  
Chief of fertile Kurukūr, adoring Kaṇṇaṉ, the Redeemer  
Of sins, one and aḷḷ, will of all their sins be cured  
And attain the blissful heaven, revered by the Celestials over there.

**Notes**

\(i\) Unable to stand the sufferings of the Āḻvār any longer, the Lord came down post-haste and relieved the Āḻvār of his erstwhile distress. That is why the Āḻvār calls Him, the great Redeemer of all sins. Even if the parents give up their daughter, the husband who took her by the hand, will never give her up. The Lord’s *paragata svīkāra*’ (i.e.) wooing His devotee and taking him within His grip always endures unlike the mother who finds herself helpless and plays the role of an anxious on-looker.

\(ii\) Those that learn this decad, either engrossed in its sweetness or banking on its potentiality for good, will attain the blissful Heaven, where there is no risk of separation from the Lord (viśleṣa), and have a royal reception, at the hands of the exalted band of ‘*Nitya Sūrīs*.’ (The ever-free, eternal angels).
