## 00 Intro6.4
In the last decad of the last centum, the Āḻvār wished to sustain himself by contemplating the Lord’s wondrous deeds during His Avatāras but literally broke down, overwhelmed by emotion. It was with deep sorrow, born of frustration, he then gave vent to his inability to steady himself and recount the Lord’s deeds, mighty and miraculous. But the picture which has now emerged, is vastly different, the erstwhile emotional break-down and exhaustion yielding place to exhilaration. In every song, the first two lines, (as in the original text), recount the Lord's glorious deeds and activities while the next two lines bespeak the Āḻvār’s extraordinary joy, resulting from such recital *cum* contemplation. In dire contrast to the appalling sense of worthlessness, betrayed by him quite often in the earlier songs, the Āḻvār now concludes each song by showering on himself praises like, “there is none equal to me in all the land”, “there is none above me” etc. These do not. however, smack of bravado or hauteur, being the expressions of an ecstatic mind dissolved in God-love, by-no-means comparable to the utterances of those who are in their normal senses, dominated by egoistic compulsions.

In this decad, the Āḻvār confines himself exclusively to Kṛṣṇāvatāra. Stray references, here and there, to other Avatāras, such as the Lord spanning all the worlds as Trivikram, have also an ultimate bearing on Kṛṣṇāvatāra only. c.f. Periyāḻvār Tirumoḻi where Queen Yaśodhā beckons Baby Kṛṣṇa as “Come. Come, oh, Vāmaṉa Nampī! Come, my darling!”




## 6.4.1
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

குரவை ஆய்ச்சியரோடு கோத்ததும் குன்றம் ஒன்று ஏந்தியதும்  
உரவு நீர்ப் பொய்கை நாகம் காய்ந்ததும் உட்பட மற்றும் பல  
அரவில் பள்ளிப் பிரான்தன் மாய வினைகளையே அலற்றி,  
இரவும் நன் பகலும் தவிர்கிலன் என்ன குறை எனக்கே?

kuravai āycciyarōṭu kōttatum kuṉṟam oṉṟu ēntiyatum  
uravu nīrp poykai nākam kāyntatum uṭpaṭa maṟṟum pala  
aravil paḷḷip pirāṉtaṉ māya viṉaikaḷaiyē alaṟṟi,  
iravum naṉ pakalum tavirkilaṉ eṉṉa kuṟai eṉakkē?

**English translation of verse 6.4.1:**

Could there be any want for us, who dote, night and day,  
On the many exploits, mighty and marvellous, of the great Benefactor,  
Our Lord, resting on serpent-bed. His dancing with Gopīs, going gay,  
Lifting up Mount Govardhana and trouncing the serpent in deep waters?

### Note

The Lord, who was reposing on His serpent-bed in the Milky-ocean, gave up His bed and came down to Mathurā (Uttar Pradesh). Recounting the many deeds of Lord Kṛṣṇa, Who thus came down from the Milk-ocean to Mathurā, the Āḻvār begins with the famous ‘Rāsa Krīḍā’ where Kṛṣṇa assumes many forms and holds the hand of each of the half a million Gopīs, moving in a circle. It is but appropriate that the Āḻvār begins with this event, as he feels that his reunion with the Lord, after all that squabble in VI-2, is like the ‘Rāsa Krīḍā’. On His part, the Lord, feels that His union with the Āḻvār gives Him the same amount of pleasure as He had, when in the company of that vast multitude of Gopīs during that classic dance. And then, the said dance revealed the amazing simplicity of the Lord. Such simplicity can, however, be appreciated in its true light only when it emanates from one who enjoys paramountcy (paratva) as well. Therefore it is, that the Āḻvār recounts the lifting of Mount Govardhana, betokening Śrī Kṛṣṇa’s supremacy, immediately after ‘Rāsa Krīḍā’.




## 6.4.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கேயத் தீம்குழல் ஊதிற்றும் நிரைமேய்த்ததும் கெண்டை ஒண்கண்  
வாசப் பூங்குழல் பின்னை தோள்கள் மணந்ததும் மற்றும்பல,  
மாயக் கோலப் பிரான்தன் செய்கை நினைந்து மனம்குழைந்து,  
நேயத்தோடு கழிந்த போது எனக்கு எவ் உலகம் நிகரே?

kēyat tīmkuḻal ūtiṟṟum niraimēyttatum keṇṭai oṇkaṇ  
vācap pūṅkuḻal piṉṉai tōḷkaḷ maṇantatum maṟṟumpala,  
māyak kōlap pirāṉtaṉ ceykai niṉaintu maṉamkuḻaintu,  
nēyattōṭu kaḻinta pōtu eṉakku ev ulakam nikarē?

**English translation of verse 6.4.2:**

Equal unto me, is there a world, as I go into raptures  
Over the wondrous Lord, playing the flute sweet, leading cows to pasture,  
Getting locked in sweet embrace of fish-eyed Piṉṉai, whose locks  
Are with fragrant flowers bedecked and myriads of such miracles?

### Notes

\(i\) A whole decad has been devoted by Periyāḻvār to a thrilling description of the enthralling strains from Lord Kṛṣṇā’s flute. Śrī Parāṣara Bhaṭṭar has epitomised all that, in just one Śloka of the second centum of his ‘Śrī Raṅgarāja Stavaṃ’, where the author goes to the extent of saying that Śrī Kṛṣṇa felt entranced by His own music.

\(ii\) Oh, what a wonder of wonders! The Lord in Heaven, unfolding an unending stream of bliss unto the ‘Nityās’ and Muktās comes down to Earth, taking birth in the shepherd community, known for its low intelligence, and becomes one of them, tending the cows and calves with great delight, excelling even His desire to stay in Heaven. It is said that, even after His return to the Celestium, He fondly recollected this particular activity of His, during His Avatāra as Kṛṣṇa, and sometimes even uttered the sounds, “ḍriyö! ḍriyö!”, fancying that He was following the flock of cows and calves, tending them. Musing over Lord Kṛṣṇa’s wondrous deeds on Earth, the Saint feels that this unique enjoyment of his cannot be had even in the high Heaven where the Lord’s transcendent glory is far more pronounced, throwing into shade His other aspect of ‘Saulabhya’ (easy accessibility).




## 6.4.3
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நிகர் இல் மல்லரைச் செற்றதும் நிரை மேய்த்ததும் நீள் நெடும் கைச்,  
சிகர மா களிறு அட்டதும் இவை போல்வனவும் பிறவும்,  
புகர்கொள் சோதிப் பிரான்தன் செய்கை நினைந்து புலம்பி என்றும்  
நுகர வைகல் வைகப்பெற்றேன் எனக்கு என் இனி நோவதுவே?

nikar il mallaraic ceṟṟatum nirai mēyttatum nīḷ neṭum kaic,  
cikara mā kaḷiṟu aṭṭatum ivai pōlvaṉavum piṟavum,  
pukarkoḷ cōtip pirāṉtaṉ ceykai niṉaintu pulampi eṉṟum  
nukara vaikal vaikappeṟṟēṉ eṉakku eṉ iṉi nōvatuvē?

**English translation of verse 6.4.3:**

Could there be any affliction for me, who time does eke  
With mind and tongue steeped in the deeds miraculous  
Of (Kṛṣṇa), the radiant Lord, His killing the wrestlers peerless,  
Tending the cows and slaying the elephant, tall and huge, with long trunk?

### Notes

\(i\) Śrī Kṛṣṇa had to encounter hostile wrestlers on two different occasions. The first was when Akrūra escorted Him and Balarāma to Kaṃsa’s court, all the way from Vrindāvan. Right at the entrance to the palace was stationed a frenzied elephant of formidable size, in must, so as to pull down the Divine Brothers and trample them to death. But Kṛṣṇa pulled out the tusk and slew the animal with it, effortlessly. After overcoming this initial hurdle, they advanced towards the palace, only to be confronted, very soon, by two heavy-weight wrestlers, Cāṇūra and Muṣṭika, of enormous proportions. These were also vanquished, in no time, by Kṛṣṇa, the divine lad.

The next occasion, when Śrī Kṛṣṇa had to face wrestlers, was in Duryodhana’s palace. The Lord went to Duryodhana’s court, as a messenger from the Pāṇḍavas but the evil-minded Duryodhana had put up a nicely decorated throne for Śrī Kṛṣṇa, on a fake dais, with a false floor. As soon as Kṛṣṇa took His seat, the flimsy floor gave way and He went deep into the hollow beneath, where remained hidden a band of wrestlers, ready to pounce upon Him. Assuming a gigantic form (Viśva Rūpa), He quelled them all, with perfect ease.

\(ii\) The radiance of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, referred to, in this song, is the one, contemporaneously enjoyed and given expression to, by the fortunate damsels in Mathurā city, who beheld the special glow on the Lord’s face after He vanquished the huge elephant and the mighty wrestlers.




## 6.4.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நோவ ஆய்ச்சி உரலோடு ஆர்க்க இரங்கிற்றும் வஞ்சப் பெண்ணைச்  
சாவப் பால் உண்டதும் ஊர் சகடம் இறச் சாடியதும்,  
தேவக் கோலப் பிரான்தன் செய்கை நினைந்து மனம்குழைந்து,  
மேவக் காலங்கள் கூடினேன் எனக்கு என் இனி வேண்டுவதே?

tēvak kōlap pirāṉtaṉ ceykai niṉaintu maṉamkuḻaintu,  
mēvak kālaṅkaḷ kūṭiṉēṉ eṉakku eṉ iṉi vēṇṭuvatē?

**English translation of verse 6.4.4:**

Contemplate do I, with all my heart, all the time.  
The wondrous deeds of the Lord of ultra-mundane Form,  
The pain on His person, when tied to a pounder by His mother.  
His sucking to death the breast of (Pūtanā), the Imposter,  
His kicking to pieces the demon in the cart-wheel and many others;  
Is there indeed a thing I need, any further?

### Note

Nañcīyar used to observe, with great feeling, while chanting this song: “Look at the telling manner in which this song has been worded by the Saint. The pain on the person of child Kṛṣṇa, when He was tied to the pounder by Yaśodhā, is now felt by the Āḻvār as if it were inflicted on him. Oh, what an engrossment!”




## 6.4.5
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வேண்டித் தேவர் இரக்க வந்து பிறந்ததும் வீங்கு இருள்வாய்-  
பூண்டு அன்று அன்னைப் புலம்ப போய் அங்கு ஓர் ஆய்க்குலம் புக்கதும்  
காண்டல் இன்றி வளர்ந்து கஞ்சனைத் துஞ்ச வஞ்சம் செய்ததும்,  
ஈண்டு நான் அலற்றப்பெற்றேன் எனக்கு என்ன இகல் உளதே?

vēṇṭit tēvar irakka vantu piṟantatum vīṅku iruḷvāy-  
pūṇṭu aṉṟu aṉṉaip pulampa pōy aṅku ōr āykkulam pukkatum  
kāṇṭal iṉṟi vaḷarntu kañcaṉait tuñca vañcam ceytatum,  
īṇṭu nāṉ alaṟṟappeṟṟēṉ eṉakku eṉṉa ikal uḷatē?

**English translation of verse 6.4.5:**

Full-throated do I recount, right here, the deeds golden,  
Of my Lord Who incarnated (as Kṛṣṇa) at Devas’ request,  
And to set at naught the mother’s fears did retreat.  
Under cover of night, into the shepherd clan and hidden  
From enemies grew, outwitted Kañcaṉ and him did slay;  
Is there for me any want that needs to be allayed?

### Notes

\(i\) The Lord's incarnation is ostensibly at the request of the Devas but intrinsically to fulfil His own urge to mingle freely with the devout, over here, and feed them with His exquisite charm and exhilarating traits—the ‘Sādhu paritrāṇāṃ’ (Sustenance of the devout), in its true sense.

\(ii\) King Kaṃsa, simulating affection for Balarāma and Kṛṣṇa, his nephews, invited them to attend the festival of archery so that they could be vanquished by the one or the other agency, set up by him for the purpose and then openly bemoan their loss, to avoid public suspicion. But, alas! he was outwitted by the Omniscient Kṛṣṇa, who was well aware of Kaṃsa’s nefarious designs on Him, and put an end to him and his evil intentions.

\(iii\) Having lost all the earlier babes, right at emergence from her womb, Devaki caught hold of the Divine Babe’s feet and begged of Him, both, out of maternal love and fear of the tyrant of a brother (Kaṃsa), to retreat elsewhere and remain safe.




## 6.4.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

இகல் கொள் புள்ளைப் பிளந்ததும் இமில் ஏறுகள் செற்றதுவும்,  
உயர் கொள் சோலைக் குருந்து ஒசித்ததும் உட்பட மற்றும்பல,  
அகல் கொள் வையம் அளந்த மாயன் என்னப்பன் தன் மாயங்களே,  
பகல் இராப் பரவப் பெற்றேன் எனக்கு என்ன மனப் பரிப்பே?

ikal koḷ puḷḷaip piḷantatum imil ēṟukaḷ ceṟṟatuvum,  
uyar koḷ cōlaik kuruntu ocittatum uṭpaṭa maṟṟumpala,  
akal koḷ vaiyam aḷanta māyaṉ eṉṉappaṉ taṉ māyaṅkaḷē,  
pakal irāp paravap peṟṟēṉ eṉakku eṉṉa maṉap parippē?

**English translation of verse 6.4.6:**

Blest am I to laud, day and night, the wondrous deeds  
Of my mysterious Lord Who spanned all the worlds,  
Tore into twain the beak of the demoniac bird, controlled  
The unruly bulls and slew, ‘tween the twin trees rolled  
And pulled them down, these and many more wonders;  
Could there for me be mental affliction any longer?

**Note**

A demon, set upon child Kṛṣṇa by Kaṃsa, stood on the bank of the river Yamuna, in the form of a gigantic stork and swallowed the Divine Child Who, however, blistered the stomach of the bird. Unable to bear the torture inside, the devil spat the child out and was about to peck at Him with its beak, when the latter took time by the forelock and split the bird’s beak into two and killed it. In his ‘Yādavābhyudhayam Śrī Vedānta Deśika says that the bird was of formidable proportions, looking like a winged Kailās mountin, creeping slowly and that, after it was slain, its plumes were tied up, here and there, by the shepherd boys, as a warning signal for evil-doers, with sinister designs on the Divine child.




## 6.4.7
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மனப் பரிப்போடு அழுக்கு மானிட சாதியில் தான்பிறந்து,  
தனக்கு வேண்டு உருக்கொண்டு தான் தன சீற்றத்தினை முடிக்கும்,  
புனத் துழாய் முடி மாலை மார்பன் என் அப்பன் தன் மாயங்களே,  
நினைக்கும் நெஞ்சு உடையேன் எனக்கு இனி யார் நிகர் நீள் நிலத்தே?

maṉap parippōṭu aḻukku māṉiṭa cātiyil tāṉpiṟantu,  
taṉakku vēṇṭu urukkoṇṭu tāṉ taṉa cīṟṟattiṉai muṭikkum,  
puṉat tuḻāy muṭi mālai mārpaṉ eṉ appaṉ taṉ māyaṅkaḷē,  
niṉaikkum neñcu uṭaiyēṉ eṉakku iṉi yār nikar nīḷ nilattē?

**English translation of verse 6.4.7:**

Is there any one, a match unto me, in this huge world,  
Possessing as I do, a mind wholly absorbed in the wondrous deeds  
Of my Sire, wearing tuḷaci garland fresh, on His crown  
And winsome chest, the radiant Lord assuming Forms of His own  
And coming into the midst of the dirty humans,  
Just to give vent to His fury and quell ungodly demons?

### Notes

\(i\) The last line conveys the cream of this song. The benevolent Lord gets terribly furious when His devotees are offended against; if He came down and took birth among the humans, with all their dirt and squalor and engaged Himself in a duel with Hiraṇya and Rāvaṇa, it was because of the terrible affront they had thrown at His devotees. The Lord’s anger would not get appeased until He tormented and tortured the offenders, even though He could quell them all, by a mere resolve, without moving His little finger. This is how the illustrious Nañcīyar would interpret the Lord’s advent and obviously, he derived his authority from the text of this song. Nampilḻai puts it that the mother’s anger over those, who tease and torment her child, can subside only when she pours forth her ire on them. In this simile the mother takes the place of the Lord and the child, that of His devotee.

\(ii\) The Tuḷaci garland, cool and fresh, will be worn by the Lord only when His anger subsides after the extermination of the enemies of His devotees.

\(iii\) For His Avatāras, the Lord assumes the form of His choice, eminently suited for the purpose—“Icchā grahīto abhimatoru dehaḥ”, as the Sages put it and “Sambhavāmi ātmamāyayā”, as the Lord Himself has stated in Bhagavad Gita (4-6). The word ‘ātmamāyayā’ means ‘ātmecchayā’, (as He likes).




## 6.4.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நீள் நிலத்தொடு வான் வியப்ப நிறை பெரும் போர்கள் செய்து  
வாணன் ஆயிரம் தோள் துணித்ததும் உட்பட மற்றும்பல,  
மாணி ஆய் நிலம் கொண்ட மாயன் என் அப்பன் தன் மாயங்களே  
காணும் நெஞ்சு உடையேன் எனக்கு இனி என்ன கலக்கம் உண்டே?

nīḷ nilattoṭu vāṉ viyappa niṟai perum pōrkaḷ ceytu

māṇi āy nilam koṇṭa māyaṉ eṉ appaṉ taṉ māyaṅkaḷē  
kāṇum neñcu uṭaiyēṉ eṉakku iṉi eṉṉa kalakkam uṇṭē?

**English translation of verse 6.4.8:**

Blest with a mind that can envision my wondrous Lord  
Who, as Vāmana, got as a gift (from Bali) the whole world  
And (as Kṛṣṇa) waged the battle big, the denizens admired  
Both in Heaven and Earth and Vāṇaṉ’s thousand arms severed,  
How can I from mental agitation suffer any longer?

### Note

Bāṇāsura was a descendent of Mahā Bali from whom Lord Vāmana Mūrti managed to get the entire land, as gift. The furious battle waged by Lord Kṛṣṇa against Bāṇāsura and how, in the end, he was let off with a bare four arms, out of the thousand he had, at the special intervention and request of Rudra, have been set out already, in great detail, in the notes below III-10-4.




## 6.4.9
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கலக்க ஏழ் கடல் ஏழ் மலை உலகு ஏழும் கழியக் கடாய்  
உலக்கத் தேர்கொடு சென்ற மாயமும் உட்பட மற்றும் பல,  
வலக்கை ஆழி இடக்கைச் சங்கம் இவை உடை மால்வண்ணனை,  
மலக்கும் நா உடையேற்கு மாறு உளதோ இம் மண்ணின் மிசையே?

kalakka ēḻ kaṭal ēḻ malai ulaku ēḻum kaḻiyak kaṭāy

valakkai āḻi iṭakkaic caṅkam ivai uṭai mālvaṇṇaṉai,  
malakkum nā uṭaiyēṟku māṟu uḷatō im maṇṇiṉ micaiyē?

**English translation of verse 6.4.9:**

By my tongue (love-inspired) I captivate the cloud-hued Lord  
Who the discus wields in right hand and the conch in His left,  
Who (as Kṛṣṇa) drove to the regions afar, in a chariot deft,  
Across the seas seven, the mountains seven and the seven worlds  
And many such wonders did perform; equal unto me  
Could there, in all the land, any one be?

### Notes

\(i\) The episode of Śrī Kṛṣṇa going in a chariot, along with a Brahmin and Arjuna, to the ultra-mundane region and restoring to the Brahmin, his missing children, reclaimed from Heaven, has been set forth, in detail, in the notes below III-10-5.

\(ii\) Saint Nammāḻvār is also known as Parāṅkuśa, the goad weaning round his spiritual antagonists through his scintillating hymns and making the Lord Himself pliable, enraptured by these sweet, love-laden hymns. The significance of this name has well been brought out. in this song. The discus and conch in the Lord’s hands typify ‘Time’ and ‘space’ or ‘infinity’ and ‘immensity’, respectively. As Śrī Parāśara Bhaṭṭar elucidated, while discoursing on this song, it is indeed impossible to enclose and entrap a God of this nature, but the prodigality of a Saint’s love does exceed these limits and encompasses even the Infinite. Verily, a God of ‘Space’ and ‘Time’ is like a wayward Elephant, roaming at liberty, unrestrained and even such an  
Elephant, Saint Nammāḻvār, rather Parāṅkuśa, in this context, claims to curb and restrain. That is why he is significantly referring to the cloud-hued Lord along with His attributes, namely, ‘Discus’ and ‘Conch’.




## 6.4.10
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மண்மிசைப் பெரும் பாரம் நீங்க ஓர் பாரத மா பெரும் போர்  
பண்ணி, மாயங்கள் செய்து, சேனையைப் பாழ்பட நூற்றிட்டுப் போய்,  
விண்மிசைத் தன தாமமேபுக மேவிய சோதிதன்தாள்,  
நண்ணி நான் வணங்கப்பெற்றேன் எனக்கு ஆர்பிறர் நாயகரே?

viṇmicait taṉa tāmamēpuka mēviya cōtitaṉtāḷ,  
naṇṇi nāṉ vaṇaṅkappeṟṟēṉ eṉakku ārpiṟar nāyakarē?

**English translation of verse 6.4.10:**

There's none to order me about, blest that I am to approach  
And adore the feet of my resplendent Lord Who rid the Earth  
Of its unwholesome burden, thro’ the great war of Mahā-Bhāratha  
And its wondrous strategy, with the resolve firm to rout  
The armies, one and all, and did later His Celestium reach.

### Note

The inhabitants of the Earth having turned out to be unholy and selfish pleasure-seekers, Mother Earth couldn’t carry the unwholesome burden. Lord Kṛṣṇa is said to have incarnated, to rid the Earth of this unwholesome burden and the great War of Mahābhārata came in handy for this purpose, the number of survivors on both sides being so sparse that they could easily be counted on one’s finger tips. Lord Kṛṣṇa controlled the military strategy, unique in several respects, at every turn and led the Pāṇḍavas to a formal victory. After His hectic deeds, down below, Śrī Kṛṣṇa went back to the Celestium. The Āḻvār exults with chuckling pride, in this song, that he could enjoy the manner of the Lord’s descent into this dismal abode of dirt and devilry and His safe return to the Celestium, at the end of His breath-taking activities over here. It is said that, at the happy conclusion of the ten-day festival (Brahmotsava) of Lord Raṅganātha, in Śrīraṅgam, two Savants, by name, Mutaliyāṇṭāṉ and Empār, prostrated before each other and got locked up, in an embrace, in grateful acknowledgement of the safe conclusion of the festival of the Lord, of an extremely delicate Form and that too, in the midst of crores of persons, selfish and egoistic. Nañcīyar, who happened to watch the said rapport between those two God-lovers, passed on the information to others and it has thus been handed down to posterity.




## 6.4.11
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நாயகன் முழு ஏழ் உலகுக்கும் ஆய் முழு ஏழ் உலகும், தன்  
வாயகம் புக வைத்து உமிழ்ந்து அவை ஆய் அவை அல்லனும் ஆம்,  
கேசவன் அடி இணைமிசைக் குருகூர்ச் சடகோபன் சொன்ன  
தூய ஆயிரத்து இப்பத்தால் பத்தர் ஆவர் துவள் இன்றியே.

nāyakaṉ muḻu ēḻ ulakukkum āy muḻu ēḻ ulakum, taṉ

kēcavaṉ aṭi iṇaimicaik kurukūrc caṭakōpaṉ coṉṉa  
tūya āyirattu ippattāl pattar āvar tuvaḷ iṉṟiyē.

**English translation of verse 6.4.11:**

Those that learn these songs ten, out of the immaculate thousand  
Composed by Caṭakōpaṉ of Kurukūr, adoring the lovely pair of feet  
Of Kēcavaṉ, the Lord Supreme of the entire Universe Who sustained  
All the worlds in His stomach and then spat them out,  
Who pervades them all and would all the same  
From them remain apart, will blemishless devotees become.

### Notes

\(i\) *Blemishless devotees*: Those that learn these songs will be exclusively devoted to Lord Kṛṣṇa, like Saint Nammāḻvār. It is this exclusive devotion like unto that of Toṇṭaraṭippoṭi Āḻvār for the holy Śrīraṅgam, that the word ‘blemishless’ connotes.

\(ii\) *The immaculate thousand*: Contrary to his prefatory resolve to write out Śrī Rāma’s life story, Śrī Vālmīki introduced quite a few extraneous anecdotes, such as the genesis of Gangā, birth of Kārthikeya and so on. Likewise, Sage Vyāsa made no secret of his intention to tell the story of Lord Nārāyaṇa but got terribly discursive and literally turned his Mahābhārata into a war-memoir, with a bewildering maze of episodes, inter-twined and inter-locked. On the other hand, true to his resolve in ‘Tiruviruttam’, the first of his four works, that he would sing the praise of ‘Tirumāl’ (Mahā Viṣṇu) and nothing but that, *Nammāḻvār kept up the tempo throughout, uninterrupted by anything else* and thus his works became the cream of the whole compendium of ‘Divya Prabhandham’, even as ‘Puruṣa Sūktaṃ’ gets the pride of place among the Vedas, ‘Manu Smṛti’, among the Dharma Śāstras, ‘Bhagavad Gītā’ in Mahābhārata and ‘Viṣṇu Purāṇa’, among the Purāṇas. Thus ‘Tiruvāymoḻi’ is *pure and unalloyed*.
