## 00 Intro2.10
In the last decad, the Āḻvār stressed the need for quick action on the part of the Lord, while praying that He should take service from him, at all times. The Āḻvār’s agitation for expeditious result was, however, construed by the Lord as the Āḻvār’s desire to serve in this body itself and He, therefore, directed the Āḻvār to serve Him in His Iconic Form in Tirumāliruñcōlai malai (very near to Maturai in the South), a nice, quiet place, abounding in lovely hills and beautiful orchards. The Āḻvār accordingly enjoys alike the pilgrim centre and the Lord enshrined there, his predilections extending even to the other hills, in and around, and the very route leading thereto.




## 2.10.1
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கிளர் ஒளி இளமை கெடுவதன் முன்னம்,  
வளர் ஒளி மாயோன் மருவிய கோயில்,  
வளர் இளம் பொழில் சூழ் மாலிருஞ்சோலை,  
தளர்வு இலர் ஆகிச் சார்வது சதிரே.

kiḷar oḷi iḷamai keṭuvataṉ muṉṉam,  
vaḷar oḷi māyōṉ maruviya kōyil,  
vaḷar iḷam poḻil cūḻ māliruñcōlai,  
taḷarvu ilar ākic cārvatu catirē.

**English translation of verse 2.10.1:**

Ere the youth, up and radiant, gets blasted  
‘Tis but meet that one reaches with a mind steadfast,  
Māliruñcōlai, the hill resort, full of orchards.  
Young and lovely, where stays always the wondrous Lord  
Of (growing splendour and) mounting radiance.

**Notes**

\(i\) Even reaching the holy place, ‘Tirumāliruñcōlai Malai’, is an end in itself, says the Āḻvār. Even as one is advised to acquire knowledge when still young so as to reap the benefit thereof, in later years, one is advised to go to this pilgrim centre while still young and before the sensual pleasures get hold of the rising youth and distract it.

\(ii\) There is nothing like growth or diminution, waxing or waning for the Lord Who is immutable and yet, His Splendour is said to grow by virtue of the exhilarating impact of this lovely station on the Lord. This is sheer poetic grandeur extolling the beauty of the place.

\(iii\) This is one of the four principal Vaiṣṇava Pilgrim centres,, the other three being Śrīraṅgam, Tirumalai and Kāñcīpuram.




## 2.10.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

சதிர் இள மடவார் தாழ்ச்சியை மதியாது,  
அதிர் குரல் சங்கத்து அழகர் தம் கோயில்,  
மதி தவழ் குடுமி மாலிருஞ்சோலைப்,  
பதியது ஏத்தி எழுவது பயனே.

catir iḷa maṭavār tāḻcciyai matiyātu,  
atir kural caṅkattu aḻakar tam kōyil,  
mati tavaḻ kuṭumi māliruñcōlaip,  
patiyatu ētti eḻuvatu payaṉē.

**English translation of verse 2.10.2:**

Better ignore the viles and charms of damsels young  
And on Māliruñcōlai, meditate for your good;  
The Moon walks on its tops and the conch keeps blowing  
In the temple of Aḻakar, our Lord.




## 2.10.3
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

பயன் அல்ல செய்து பயன் இல்லை நெஞ்சே,  
புயல் மழை வண்ணர் புரிந்து உறை கோயில்,  
மயல் மிகு பொழில் சூழ் மாலிருஞ்சோலை,  
அயல்மலை அடைவது அது கருமமே.

payaṉ alla ceytu payaṉ illai neñcē,  
puyal maḻai vaṇṇar purintu uṟai kōyil,  
mayal miku poḻil cūḻ māliruñcōlai,  
ayalmalai aṭaivatu atu karumamē.

**English translation of verse 2.10.3:**

My mind, better desist from deeds futile  
And reach the mount beside Māliruñ Cōlai, lovely and fertile.  
Surrounded by many an enchanting orchard,  
The favourite resort of the cloud-hued Lord.

**Notes**

\(i\) In the last two stanzas, the Āḻvār expatiated on the glory of the Pilgrim centre, Known as ‘Māliruñ cōlai’, treating one’s visit to that place or mere meditation of the station as an end in itself. And now, the Āḻvār extends the same treatment even to another mount in its vicinity, by virtue of its associaton with ‘Māliruñcōlai Malai’.

\(ii\) The futile deeds, referred to, are rites and rituals performed for attaining swarga etc, or even contemplation of the Lord’s transcendent glory and the by-gone Avatāras. The emphasis thus rests on this pilgrim centre which is now getting broad-based so as to include the neighbouring mountain, as well.




## 2.10.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கரும வன் பாசம் கழித்து உழன்று உய்யவே,  
பெருமலை எடுத்தான் பீடு உறை கோயில்,  
வரு மழை தவழும் மாலிருஞ்சோலைத்,  
திருமலை அதுவே அடைவது திறமே.

karuma vaṉ pācam kaḻittu uḻaṉṟu uyyavē,  
perumalai eṭuttāṉ pīṭu uṟai kōyil,  
varu maḻai tavaḻum māliruñcōlait,  
tirumalai atuvē aṭaivatu tiṟamē.

**English translation of verse 2.10.4:**

Going over to Māliruñ cōlai is real good,  
Where the rain-clouds crawl and dwells the Lord  
For ever, for us to serve Him and get undone  
Our ‘*Kārmik*’ bonds tough; His person does the glory beam  
Of His great deliverance of Mount (Govardhan)

**Note**

To extricate ourselves from the otherwise inextricable bondage of ‘Karma’ and to serve the Lord, the Āḻvār deems it but proper that we should reach this sacred hill where the Lord stays for ever, with great delight. That He is the great deliverer is writ large on the person of Lord Aḻakar enshrined there, proclaiming His great glory as the deliverer of the inhabitants of the pastoral village of Gokula from the fury of Indra, by holding aloft Mount Govardhana for a whole week during His Avatāra as Kṛṣṇa.




## 2.10.5
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

திறம் உடை வலத்தால் தீவினை பெருக்காது,  
அறம் முயல் ஆழிப் படையவன் கோயில்,  
மறு இல் வண் சுனை சூழ் மாலிருஞ்சோலைப்,  
புறமலை சாரப் போவது கிறியே.

tiṟam uṭai valattāl tīviṉai perukkātu,  
aṟam muyal āḻip paṭaiyavaṉ kōyil,  
maṟu il vaṇ cuṉai cūḻ māliruñcōlaip,  
puṟamalai cārap pōvatu kiṟiyē.

**English translation of verse 2.10.5:**

Do not your energy dissipate and your sins multiply.  
Better go to the mount close to Māliruñ Cōlai,  
Surrounded by cascades, neat and lovely,  
Where stays the Lord, bent on protection  
Of His devotees, holding the discus, that benevolent weapon..

**Note**

The Āḻvār brings on a par with ‘Māliruñ Cōlai malai’ another mount around. He advises that all one’s energy, that might otherwise be dissipated on selfish pursuits breeding endless sins, could as well be used up in going on a pilgrimage to the said mount.




## 2.10.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கிறி என நினைமின் கீழ்மை செய்யாதே,  
உறி அமர் வெண்ணெய் உண்டவன் கோயில்,  
மறியொடு பிணை சேர் மாலிருஞ்சோலை,  
நெறி பட அதுவே நினைவது நலமே.

kiṟi eṉa niṉaimiṉ kīḻmai ceyyātē,  
uṟi amar veṇṇey uṇṭavaṉ kōyil,  
maṟiyoṭu piṇai cēr māliruñcōlai,  
neṟi paṭa atuvē niṉaivatu nalamē.

**English translation of verse 2.10.6:**

Desist from base deeds and remember  
‘Tis good to think solely of traversing the road  
Which leads to Māliruñ Cōlai where live together  
Herds of deer and young ones and stays our Lord,  
Who from hanging hoops ate up all the butter.

**Notes**

\(i\) The Āḻvār advises people to divert the mind from sensual pleasures and *fix it on the route leading to ‘Māliruñ Cōlai*’ where Lord Kṛṣṇa stays on, to grant ‘darśana’ to us, the post-incarnation beneficiaries.

\(ii\) Even as the deer and the young ones stay together, it behoves us to stay on with the Lord, our eternal Father and Mother, rolled into one.




## 2.10.7
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நலம் என நினைமின் நரகு அழுந்தாதே,  
நிலம் முனம் இடந்தான் நீடு உறை கோயில்,  
மலம் அறு மதி சேர் மாலிருஞ்சோலை,  
வலம் முறை எய்தி, மருவுதல் வலமே.

nalam eṉa niṉaimiṉ naraku aḻuntātē,  
nilam muṉam iṭantāṉ nīṭu uṟai kōyil,  
malam aṟu mati cēr māliruñcōlai,  
valam muṟai eyti, maruvutal valamē.

**English translation of verse 2.10.7:**

It would be best if you got yourself attached,  
With due reverence, to Māliruñ Cōlai where shines  
The Moon clear and dwells the Lord Who once  
Redeemed the Earth (as the Boar unique); better teach  
Your mind this advice good, let it not dredge in hell.

**Notes**

\(i\) Going to hell does not mean that those who somehow fail to visit this pilgrim centre will go to hell. To be in conjunction with the Lord, as Sītā put it to Śrī Rāma before setting out for exile, is Swarga while being away from Him is hell. The emphasis here is, therefore, on not getting parted from the Lord.

\(ii\) The Moon’s blemishes having been removed by his rubbing against the hill-top of this station, he is shining quite clear.

\(iii\) “*With due reverence*”: duly realising the inter-relationship between Man and God.




## 2.10.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வலஞ்செய்து வைகல் வலம் கழியாதே,  
வலஞ்செய்யும் ஆய மாயவன் கோயில்,  
வலஞ்செய்யும் வானோர் மாலிருஞ்சோலை,,  
வலஞ்செய்து நாளும் மருவுதல் வழக்கே.

valañceytu vaikal valam kaḻiyātē,  
valañceyyum āya māyavaṉ kōyil,  
valañceyyum vāṉōr māliruñcōlai,,  
valañceytu nāḷum maruvutal vaḻakkē.

**English translation of verse 2.10.8:**

Acquire strength all right but waste it never,  
Better go round daily Māliruñ Cōlai where stands enshrined  
The wondrous shepherd (Kṛṣṇa), our great Benefactor  
And the Celestials come down and move around.

**Notes**

\(1\) The Lord gives Himself unto His devotees, besides the strength to enjoy the rapport with Him. Lord Aḻakar Himself goes round Mount Māliruñcōḷai, in the company of His Consorts, even as Śrī Rāma and Sītā went round, hand in hand, the mountain slopes of Citrakūṭa.

Even as the citizens of Ayodhyā followed Śrī Rāma when he went into exile, the Celestials do come to this pilgrim centre and circumambulate the temple of Aḻakar. It would indeed be a grievous misuse of the specially endowed human body, highly conducive to holding communion with the Lord and serving Him in a number of ways, if it strayed into the domain of sensual pleasures, thus moving in the opposite direction.

\(ii\) Nañcīyar is said to have related from personal experience how he observed Śrī Parāśara Bhaṭṭar and Piḷḷai Tirunarayūr Arayar, leisurely pacing about the premises of the temples, gazing at the tall turrets and the lovely mansions around, in short, imbibing every small detail, literally drinking them in, with their eyes. This was in dire contrast to the men of the world to whom visiting temples is a mere formality, moving about like racehorses, as if it is a place more to hurry from. For the great Savants to whom the Lord is at once the Means and the End, temples are places to stay and serve. No doubt, genuflections and circumambulations do not serve as the ‘Means’ for them and yet, they get absorbed in the sanctity of the temples and their surroundings, as an end in itself.




## 2.10.9
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வழக்கு என நினைமின் வல்வினை மூழ்காது,  
அழக்கொடி அட்டான் அமர் பெருங்கோயில்,  
மழக் களிற்று இனம் சேர் மாலிருஞ்சோலை,  
தொழக் கருதுவதே துணிவது சூதே.

vaḻakku eṉa niṉaimiṉ valviṉai mūḻkātu,  
aḻakkoṭi aṭṭāṉ amar peruṅkōyil,  
maḻak kaḷiṟṟu iṉam cēr māliruñcōlai,  
toḻak karutuvatē tuṇivatu cūtē.

**English translation of verse 2.10.9:**

Get not immersed in dire sins.  
Take this advice just and wholesome,  
‘Tis best that you firmly resolve to worship  
Māliruñ Cōḻai where elephants young herd up  
And there is the huge temple of the Lord,  
Who, the devil of a woman destroyed.

**Notes**

\(i\) The Āḻvār says, it would suffice even if one just resolved to worship this pilgrim centre.

\(ii\) The devil of a woman referred to here is Pūtanā.

\(iii\) Speaking about the herds of young elephants mustering here in strength, Nampiḷḷai observes that it is no wonder that the Lord (Aḻakar) standing like an elephant, Young and majestic, (Cōlai Maḻakkaḷiṟu) as Tirumaṅkai Āḻvār appreciates the Deity, attracts thousands of elephants,




## 2.10.10
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

சூது என்று களவும் சூதும் செய்யாதே,  
வேதம் முன் விரித்தான் விரும்பிய கோயில்,  
மாது உறு மயில் சேர் மாலிருஞ்சோலைப்,  
போது அவிழ் மலையே புகுவது பொருளே.

cūtu eṉṟu kaḷavum cūtum ceyyātē,  
vētam muṉ virittāṉ virumpiya kōyil,  
mātu uṟu mayil cēr māliruñcōlaip,  
pōtu aviḻ malaiyē pukuvatu poruḷē.

**English translation of verse 2.10.10:**

Giving up gambling and thieving as means of subsistence,  
Get into Mount Māliruñcōlai, your final goal  
Where flowers are in full bloom and lovely peacocks, in pairs, revel  
And there is the temple where the Lord lovingly stays,  
Who did elaborate the contents of the Scriptures, long back.

**Notes**

\(i\) ‘Thieving’ refers to ‘*Ātma apahāra*’, the stealing of the Soul, looking upon ourselves as our own Masters ignoring the fundamental fact that we belong to the Lord.

\(ii\) *Gambling*: indulging in quibblings to put people on the wrong track and dissuade them from believing in the existence of God, good and bad, and things of that sort.

\(iii\) Long, long ago, the Lord disseminated the Vedas, unseen, and later on, as Lord Kṛṣṇa, He expounded their inner meanings, right from the chariot on the battlefield; Bhagavad Gītā is but a restatement of the central teachings of the Upaniṣads.

\(iv\) The Lord loves to stay in this pilgrim centre, just to attract, by His exquisite charm, those not amenable to His advice (upadeśa).

\(v\) *Final Goal*: Going to Māliruñcōlai is an end in itself.




## 2.10.11
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

பொருள் என்று இவ் உலகம் படைத்தவன் புகழ்மேல்,  
மருள் இல் வண் குருகூர் வண் சடகோபன்,  
தெருள் கொள்ளச் சொன்ன ஓர் ஆயிரத்துள் இப் பத்து,  
அருளுடையவன் தாள் அணைவிக்கும் முடித்தே.

poruḷ eṉṟu iv ulakam paṭaittavaṉ pukaḻmēl,  
maruḷ il vaṇ kurukūr vaṇ caṭakōpaṉ,  
teruḷ koḷḷac coṉṉa ōr āyirattuḷ ip pattu,  
aruḷuṭaiyavaṉ tāḷ aṇaivikkum muṭittē.

**English translation of verse 2.10.11:**

These ten songs out of the thousand imparted  
By mighty Caṭakōpaṉ of famous Kurukūr, with clarity great,  
Shedding on us knowledge, clear and concise, about the Lord  
Of many an auspicious trait, Who the worlds did hopefully create.  
Will cut out *Saṃsāra* and put us at His merciful feet.

**Notes**

\(i\) As already explained in II-9-11, what is meant here again is that the Lord will be immensely pleased with those who learn these ten songs and confer on them the benefits referred to here.

\(ii\) The Lord endowed us with limbs and sense-organs so as to capacitate us into a career of gainful activity. This is what is meant by creation and He goes on with it, undaunted by adverse results, always hoping for better luck, an indefatigable Cultivator, with robust optimism.




## Retrospective Summary
(2-1): The traumatic experience of the Saint, longing for the external (physical) perception of the Lord and stung by the poignancy of separation from that priceless blue-gem, the darling of the celestials, described by him in I-10-11, is set out in vivid colours *in the first decad*; thrown into a state of deep dejection, the Āḻvār stands transformed once again as a forlorn female lover;

(2-2): The erstwhile gloom of the God-lover, sunk deep in dejection, is found to have vanished, *in to to, in the second decad*, consequent upon his exhilarating union with the Lord, the pendulum having swung to the other end; in such an exultant mood, the Saint highlights the Lord’s supremacy vis-a-vis Brahmā and Rudra, the possible contenders for this position of eminence, in the light of the wondrous deeds performed by the Lord during His incarnations;

(2-3): *In the third decad*, the Saint gives vent to the joy of his reunion with the enchanting Lord, an inexhaustible fountain of bliss;

(2-4): *In the fourth decad*, we sec the Āḻvār, thrown into deep dejection back again, inasmuch as his longing for entry into the gatherings of the devotees and singing profusely the glory of the Lord in their steadfast company, did not materialise; assuming once again the overtones of a frustrated lover. The Nāyaki’s grief is too deep for words and the gnostic mother comes on the scene and seeks clarification from the Lord as to what He proposes to do with the poor little victim, her daughter;

(2-5): Beholding, once again, the joyous Lord in all His splendour and paraphernalia, the Saint feels immensely delighted and narrates his ecstatic experience, *in the fifth decad*; the Lord meets the aspiration of the Āḻvār by conferring on him the heavenly bliss longed for by him, right here;

(2-6): *In the sixth decad*, the Āḻvār hastens to assure the Lord that he shall not part from Him any more, finding Him at the height of His joy of union with him but nevertheless apprehensive of the possibility of his slipping away, overwhelmed by His transcendent glory;

(2-7): *In the seventh decad*, the Āḻvār expatiates on the extraordinary benevolence of (he Lord, in extending His grace to all those associated with him, seven generations back and forth;

(2-8): *In the eighth decad*, the Āḻvār, swayed by boundless compassion for the suffering humanity, turns round and advises them to get into the Divine fold, taking due note of the fact that the Lord is the one and only granter of Mokṣa, the bind bliss, ridding them of their terrific involvement in the dreadful cycle of birth and death; (This is the second time the Āḻvār addresses the world, the first was in I-2.)

(2-9): *In the ninth decad* the Āḻvār pinpoints the concept of ‘Puruṣārta’, the ultimate value or final goal of every individual, the emphasis resting on the Lord’s voluntary dispensation, out of His free will and spontaneous grace, individual gratification of one’s own desire receding to the background altogether; what a lofty train of thought, totally bereft of egoistic impulses and putting the entire weight on the Lord!

(2-10): *In the concluding decad of this Centum*, the Āḻvār exhorts people to propitiate the hilarious Mount Tirumāliruñcōlai (near Mathurai, in Tamil Nāḍu) his predilections extending, even to the other hills, in and around and the very route leading thereto; the Āḻvār advises people to go to this pilgrim centre, while still young and before the sensual pleasures get hold of the rising youth and distract it.
