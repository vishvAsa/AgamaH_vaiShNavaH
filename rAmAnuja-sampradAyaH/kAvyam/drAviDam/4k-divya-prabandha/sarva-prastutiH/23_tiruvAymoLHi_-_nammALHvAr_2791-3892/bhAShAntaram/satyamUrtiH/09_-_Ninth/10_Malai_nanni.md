## 00 Intro9.10
In the eighth decad of this Centum, the Āḻvār exhibited his inordinate longing for communion with the Lord and his great grief, due to the non-realisation of the union longed for, found expression in the following decad. Seeing the Āḻvār, in such dire distress, the Lord spoke to him thus: “Well, your grief apart, mine is indeed greater than yours, inasmuch as I have not, as yet, got at you and the privation is mine; it is only for your sake that I have come down, all the way, from the High Heavens to the holy centre of Tirukkaṇṇapuram, near at hand. Surely, I will grant you your desire, at the end of the current span of life”, Thus placated, the Āḻvār gives vent to his joy, in this decad. The fifth song of this decad is the topical one, stressing the fact that the Lord is the great Benefactor, the granter of Mokṣa (eternal emancipation) when the body falls off, at the end of the current span of life.

Once again, the Saint, with his characteristic compassion for the sorrowing mankind, sunk deep down the ocean of ‘Saṃsāra addresses them all. He preaches unto them, the path of loving surrender to the Lord who is easily accessible to one and all, at the holy Tirukkaṇṇapuram, bent upon retrieving the votaries. Even if they cannot perform the physical act of prostration at the feet of the Lord, with unflinching faith, surrender unto Him calls for, the mere mention of the name of that holy centre, Tirukkaṇṇapuram will deliver the goods (vide tenth song of this decad).




## 9.10.1
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மாலைநண்ணித் தொழுதுஎழுமினோ வினைகெட  
காலைமாலை கமலமலர் இட்டு நீர்  
வேலைமோதும் மதிள்சூழ் திருக்கண்ணபுரத்து  
ஆலின்மேல்ஆல் அமர்ந்தான் அடிஇணைகளே. (2)

mālainaṇṇit toḻutueḻumiṉō viṉaikeṭa  
kālaimālai kamalamalar iṭṭu nīr  
vēlaimōtum matiḷcūḻ tirukkaṇṇapurattu  
āliṉmēlāl amarntāṉ aṭiiṇaikaḷē. (2)

**English translation of verse 9.10.1:**

Get near the Māl [Lord] at Tirukkaṇṇapuram, surrounded by walls,  
The oceanic waves dash against, the One that on a fig-leaf lay  
On a sheet of water vast and worship, ye. men, one and all,  
Placing lotus flowers at His lovely pair of feet, night and day  
And salvation attain, purged of your sins, one and all.

**Notes:**

\(i\) What the Āḻvār preaches, in this decad, is briefly mentioned here. There is indeed no restriction on the flowers with which the Lord is to be worshipped. No flower is taboo and, in the name of burning incense, as part of worship, even a heap of garbage could be burnt and smoke raised therefrom. The outward offerings may be trifles but, in God’s eyes, they carry much weight when offered with humility and devotion.

\(ii\) The sea seems to have receded from the township since; it might have been right on the sea-shore, with the billows breaking against the temple walls, during the days of the Āḻvār.




## 9.10.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கள்அவிழும் மலர்இட்டு நீர்இறைஞ்சுமின்  
நள்ளிசேரும் வயல்சூழ் கிடங்கின்புடை  
வெள்ளிஏய்ந்த மதிள்சூழ் திருக்கண்ணபுரம்  
உள்ளி நாளும்தொழுது எழுமினோ தொண்டரே!

kaḷaviḻum malariṭṭu nīriṟaiñcumiṉ  
naḷḷicērum vayalcūḻ kiṭaṅkiṉpuṭai  
veḷḷiēynta matiḷcūḻ tirukkaṇṇapuram  
uḷḷi nāḷumtoḻutu eḻumiṉō toṇṭarē!

**English translation of verse 9.10.2:**

Ye, devout men, worship the Lord with flowers fine, studded, with honey.  
And salvation do attain, lovingly meditating on Tirukkaṇṇapuram daily,  
The holy place enclosed by stately walls reaching the very sky,  
Whose moats the fields adjoin where female crabs go gay.

**Notes:**

\(i\) That there is no restriction on the flowers to be used for worshipping the Lord is brought out by reference, in this song, to honey-studded flowers, in general, and not merely the lotus, as mentioned in the preceding song. All that is needed is that the flowers should be fresh and not dried up. These flowers are only symbolic of the eight varieties of flowers to be employed by the votaries for worship, namely, ‘*Ahiṃsā*’ (non-violence), ‘*Indriya nigrahaḥ*’ (control over the Sensory organs), ‘*Sarva bhūta dayā*’ (compassion for one and all), ‘*Kṣamā*’ (forgiveness) ‘*Dhyāna* [*Dhyānam*]’ (Meditation), ‘*Tapaḥ*’ (penance or austerity), ‘*Jnāna* [*Jnānam*]’ (knowledge) and ‘*Satya* [*Satyam*]’ (Truth or veracity).

This is brought out, in the following śloka:

> “*Ahiṃsā* puṣpam pratamarh puṣpaṃ, puṣpaṃ *Indriya nigrahaḥ,
> Sarvabhūtadayā* puṣpaṃ, *Kṣamā* puṣpaṃ viśeṣataḥ, *Dhyānam* puṣpaṃ,
> *tapaḥ* puṣpaṃ, *Jñānam* puṣpaṃ tataivaca, *Satyam* aṣṭavidam puṣpaṃ
> Viṣṇoḥ prītikaraṃ bhaveth”.

\(ii\) Even loving meditation of this holy centre will secure one’s salvation. This could be done all the time, without restriction, unlike the dip in the oceanic waters, which is permissible only on certain specified days.




## 9.10.3
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

தொண்டர் நும்தம் துயர்போகநீர் கமாய்  
விண்டுவாடாமலர்இட்டு நீர்இறைஞ்சுமின்  
வண்டுபாடும் பொழில்சூழ் திருக்கண்ணபுரத்து  
அண்டவாணன் அமரர்பெருமானையே

toṇṭar numtam tuyarpōkanīr kamāy  
viṇṭuvāṭāmalariṭṭu nīriṟaiñcumiṉ  
vaṇṭupāṭum poḻilcūḻ tirukkaṇṇapurattu  
aṇṭavāṇaṉ amararperumāṉaiyē

**English translation of verse 9.10.3:**

Ye, devout men, worship with devotion supreme  
And offer flowers in fresh bloom  
Unto the Sovereign Master of the Universe, Who dwells  
In Tirukkaṇṇapuram amid orchards where humming bees revel  
And thus all your ills and evils dispel.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The highest love to God is love rendered with no personal end in view but culminating in benediction or glorification of God. Love, so disinterestedly rendered, is love of purity and virginity, which carries with it the highest reward, namely, possession of God Himself. It is this kind of loving worship that the Āḻvār is preaching to the world around, now addressed by him with his characteristic solicitude and tenderness of heart.

\(ii\) The bees allude to the knowledgeable savants, with a keen sense of discrimination, capable of picking up the essentials (honey) and discarding the otherwise.

\(iii\) The Sovereign Master of the Universe, the overlord of the Celestials has condescended to come down to our midst, taking up abode in Tirukkaṇṇapuram where His dispensation operates both ways. The Lord not only dispels our age-long sins but also confers on us heavenly bliss, right here, in His immediate presence. Unlike the infirmary for the blind, where the sighted do not have to go for treatment, even the Celestials, well beyond the mischief of dark necescience, have to come to this dark land, to taste the Lord’s amazing simplicity (Saulabhya) which is far more pronounced here than in heaven.




## 9.10.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மானைநோக்கி மடப்பின்னைதன் கேள்வனை  
தேனைவாடாமலர்இட்டு நீர்இறைஞ்சுமின்  
வானைஉந்தும் மதிள்சூழ் திருக்கண்ணபுரம்  
தான்நயந்த பெருமான் சரண்ஆகுமே.

māṉainōkki maṭappiṉṉaitaṉ kēḷvaṉai  
tēṉaivāṭāmalariṭṭu nīriṟaiñcumiṉ  
vāṉaiuntum matiḷcūḻ tirukkaṇṇapuram  
tāṉnayanta perumāṉ caraṇākumē.

**English translation of verse 9.10.4:**

Worship our sire with choice flowers, in fresh bloom,  
The doe-eyed Piṉṉai’s Spouse, sweet as honey;  
The Lord that lovingly stays in Tirukkaṇṇapuram,  
Whose walls rise up to the sky, is indeed our haven.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The doe-eyed Consort of the Lord is the unfailing intercessor between man and God and the Āḻvār is, therefore, sure of the salvation of his addressee (the worldlings) whom he advises to approach the Lord through the good offices of the Divine Mother.

\(ii\) The Āḻvār has indeed to deal with a cross-section of humanity, with varying degrees of spiritual calibre and equipment. He would not, therefore, leave out of his purview those who have not, as yet, developed that robust faith in the Lord, which makes them look upon Him as the Ready Means (siddhopāya), the Means and the End, rolled into one. For the lesser grades of mankind, he preaches the form of worship involving the use of materials, such as flowers, fresh and fine, honey etc., the ‘Sāṅga Bhakti’, as it is called, vide aphorism 227 of ‘Ācārya Hṛdayam’.




## 9.10.5
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

சரணம்ஆகும் தனதாள் அடைந்தார்க்குஎல்லாம்  
மரணம்ஆனால் வைகுந்தம் கொடுக்கும்பிரான்  
அரண்அமைந்த மதிள்சூழ் திருக்கண்ணபுரத்  
தரணியாளன் தனதுஅன்பர்க்கு அன்புஆகுமே.

caraṇamākum taṉatāḷ aṭaintārkkuellām  
maraṇamāṉāl vaikuntam koṭukkumpirāṉ  
araṇamainta matiḷcūḻ tirukkaṇṇapurat  
taraṇiyāḷaṉ taṉatuaṉparkku aṉpuākumē.

**English translation of verse 9.10.5:**

Unto those that seek refuge at His feet  
He is the perfect Protector indeed;  
Unto those that love Him with all their heart  
The Sovereign Lord is all love; the Ruler great  
Of Tirukkaṇṇapuram, enclosed by walls, safe and secure.  
Is the Benefactor great that heavenly bliss does dower  
At the fall of this material body, the outer cover.

**Notes:**

As already stated in the preamble to this decad, this is the topical song of this decad. The Lord, enshrined at Tirukkaṇṇapuram, vouchsafes heavenly bliss, at the end of the current span of life, unto those that seek refuge at His lovely pair of feet. This is the unfailing path of loving surrender at the Lord’s pair of feet, as the Sole means of salvation, which is open to one and all, unlike the discipline of ‘Bhakti yoga’ indicated in the three preceding stanzas, restricted to certain categories of persons. The Lord having assured the Āḻvār that he would be granted entry into the High Heavens as soon as his body falls off, the Āḻvār complacently styles the Lord as the “Granter of Heaven, at one’s death”.




## 9.10.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அன்பன்ஆகும் தனதாள் அடைந்தார்க்குஎல்லாம்  
செம்பொன்ஆகத்து அவுணன்உடல் கீண்டவன்,  
நன்பொன்ஏய்ந்த மதிள்சூழ் திருக்கண்ணபுரத்து  
அன்பன் நாளும் தன மெய்யர்க்கு மெய்யனே

aṉpaṉākum taṉatāḷ aṭaintārkkuellām  
cempoṉākattu avuṇaṉuṭal kīṇṭavaṉ,  
naṉpoṉēynta matiḷcūḻ tirukkaṇṇapurattu  
aṉpaṉ nāḷum taṉa meyyarkku meyyaṉē

**English translation of verse 9.10.6:**

Love He bears unto those that seek refuge at His feet,  
The body of Avuṇaṉ, of the hue of red gold, He split,  
Our Lord, Who loves to stay in Tirukkaṇṇapuram,  
Whose boundary walls, set with pure gold, do gleam,  
Truly loves those that bear true love unto Him.

**Notes:**

\(i\) Whosoever takes refuge at the Lord’s feet is tended by Him with the same loving care, without distinction of high and low.

\(ii\) It was young Prahlādā’s great devotion unto the Lord, that made Him shed His enormous grace on him, despite his belonging to the Rākṣasa clan, and slay his dastardly sire, Avuṇan (Hiraṇya). The Lord loves His devotees even more dearly than they love Him and He has lovingly chosen Tirukkaṇṇapuram, as His abode, wherein He exhibits this great trait. The Āḻvār, therefore, calls upon people to worship Him at this holy centre, with unflinching devotion, devoid of selfish ends.




## 9.10.7
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மெய்யன்ஆகும் விரும்பித் தொழுவார்க்குஎல்லாம்  
பொய்யன்ஆகும் புறமே தொழுவார்க்குஎல்லாம்  
செய்யில்வாளைஉகளும் திருக்கண்ணபுரத்து  
ஐயன் ஆகத்துஅணைப்பார்கட்கு அணியனே.

meyyaṉākum virumpit toḻuvārkkuellām  
poyyaṉākum puṟamē toḻuvārkkuellām  
ceyyilvāḷaiukaḷum tirukkaṇṇapurattu  
aiyaṉ ākattuaṇaippārkaṭku aṇiyaṉē.

**English translation of verse 9.10.7:**

All His glory and splendour He does reveal  
Unto those that seek Him as the Be-all and End-all;  
On the other hand, His true nature He does conceal  
From them that worship Him for achieving their personal needs;  
Our Sire at Tirukkaṇṇapuram, in whose fertile fields  
The fishes play about, is very close indeed  
To those that keep Him in their hearts imbedded.

**Notes:**

The Lord stays in His worshippable from at Tirukkaṇṇapuram, revealing Himself fully, unto those that love Him disinterestedly, as an end in itself, and concealing His true nature from those who seek petty, personal favours from Him and formally propitiate Him to secure their personal ends, devoid of true love unto Him.




## 9.10.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அணியன்ஆகும் தனதாள் அடைந்தார்க்குஎல்லாம்  
பிணியும்சாரா பிறவிகெடுத்துஆளும்  
மணிபொன் ஏய்ந்தமதிள்சூழ் திருக்கண்ணரம்  
பணிமின் நாளும் பரமேட்டிதன் பாதமே

aṇiyaṉākum taṉatāḷ aṭaintārkkuellām  
piṇiyumcārā piṟavikeṭuttuāḷum  
maṇipoṉ ēyntamatiḷcūḻ tirukkaṇṇaram  
paṇimiṉ nāḷum paramēṭṭitaṉ pātamē

**English translation of verse 9.10.8:**

May You for ever adore the lovely feet of the Supreme Lord  
At holy Tirukkaṇṇapuram, enclosed by walls, with gold and ruby laid,  
Him that is near at hand to those that lovingly worship  
His pair of feet and thus the dreadful cycle of birth escape,  
Rid of all ills and evils that dare not clasp you any more.

**Notes:**

The loving worship, referred to here, is the disinterested love of God, with no personal ends in view, which culminates in the highest reward, namely, possession of God Himself. Unto such votaries, the Lord is ever close and easily accessible and the natural corollary to this state is the riddance of their ills and evils, one and all, including the dreadful cycle of birth and death. Tirukkaṇṇapuram, the holy centre on Earth, looms like a Heavenly spot, set with gold, gems and rubies, in the eyes of the Saint.




## 9.10.9
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

பாதம்நாளும் பணிய தணியும்பிணி  
ஏதம்சாரா எனக்கேல் இனிஎன்குறை?  
வேதநாவர் விரும்பும் திருக்கண்ணபுரத்து  
ஆதியானை அடைந்தார்க்கு அல்லல் இல்லையே.

pātamnāḷum paṇiya taṇiyumpiṇi  
ētamcārā eṉakkēl iṉieṉkuṟai?  
vētanāvar virumpum tirukkaṇṇapurattu  
ātiyāṉai aṭaintārkku allal illaiyē.

**English translation of verse 9.10.9:**

Sorrow there’s none unto those that adore  
The Primate, the Lord Supreme Who dwells  
At Tirukkaṇṇapuram, the Vedic Scholars’ favourite abode;  
My mind with love unto Him does always swell,  
Him that does His feet for ever truly worship,  
Ills and evils shall no longer clasp;  
Is there now indeed anything I lack?

**Notes:**

The Saint preaches unto the world, voicing forth his own experience which they can very well share, if only they would adore, likewise, the feet of the Supreme Lord. The age-long accumulation of sins has been wiped off, in full, and the dreadful contingency of sins accruing hereafter has also been ruled out. If this is the case with the Āḻvār, there’s no reason why others should not achieve what he did, if only they would likewise pin all their faith in the Supreme Lord, the first and foremost, and lovingly adore His feet. Is there indeed any care or anxiety for the young one that reposes on the complacent lap of the Mother?




## 9.10.10
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

இல்லை அல்லல் எனக்கேல்இனி என்குறை?  
அல்லிமாதர் அமரும் திருமார்பினன்  
கல்லில் ஏய்ந்த மதிள்சூழ் திருக்கண்ணபுரம்  
சொல்ல நாளும் துயர் பாடுசாராவே.

illai allal eṉakkēliṉi eṉkuṟai?  
allimātar amarum tirumārpiṉaṉ  
kallil ēynta matiḷcūḻ tirukkaṇṇapuram  
colla nāḷum tuyar pāṭucārāvē.

**English translation of verse 9.10.10:**

All my miseries have gone and wants have I none,  
Sorrows are at a distance kept, at the mere mention  
Of the name of holy Tirukkaṇṇapuram, which stone walls enclose,  
Where resides the Lord on whose winsome chest does repose  
Tiru (Lakṣmī), His lotus-born spouse.

**Notes:**

The Āḻvār disclosed in the preceding song that he enjoys absolute freedom from miseries and that there is hardly any felicity that he lacks. He now says that this blissful state can be attained even by those who are incapable of pursuing the hard line of Bhakti or the path of loving surrender to His sweet grace (Prapatti), by merely mentioning the name of the holy centre, known as Tirukkaṇṇapuram. There dwells the Lord on whose winsome chest always stays the inseparable Divine Mother, the unfailing Mediatrix, the great intercessor between God and man, the very personification of grace, ever ready to wink at our countless transgressions.




## 9.10.11
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

பாடுசாரா வினைபற்றுஅற வேண்டுவீர்  
மாடம்நீடு குருகூர்ச்சடகோபன் சொல்  
பாடலானதமிழ் ஆயிரத்துள் இப்பத்தும்-  
பாடிஆடிப் பணிமின் அவன் தாள்களே (2)

pāṭucārā viṉaipaṟṟuaṟa vēṇṭuvīr  
māṭamnīṭu kurukūrccaṭakōpaṉ col  
pāṭalāṉatamiḻ āyirattuḷ ippattum-  
pāṭiāṭip paṇimiṉ avaṉ tāḷkaḷē (2)

**English translation of verse 9.10.11:**

Those of You that wish to banish effectively your age-long sins,  
Will do well to dance, singing lustily these songs ten,  
Out of the thousand choice Tamil Songs composed by Caṭakōpaṉ  
Of Kurukūr, with castles tall and the Lord’s holy feet attain.

**Notes:**

\(i\) Even the end-song partakes of the character of the other songs, in this decad, couched, as it is, in the form of an address (advice) to the men around. It can also be interpreted as conveying the benefit accruing by dint of singing these ten songs, namely, attainment of the Lord’s blissful feet. Those who sing, tunefully and with ecstatic devotion, these ten songs in adoration of Lord Śourirājaṉ [Śaurirāja/Śaurirājan?], enshrined in Tirukkaṇṇapuram, will have their sins eradicated, root and branch and attain His glorious feet. These mellifluous songs, like unto fragrant flowers, are so sweet that they hold out an irresistible fascination even to the non-zealous and unfriendly ones, if they did but once recite them.

\(ii\) It was the superabundant grace of Lord Kṛṣṇa, that impelled Him to restate through His Song Celestial, the central teachings of the Upaniṣads, for the benefit of the different grades of mankind in varying stages of evolution. Even so, Saint Nammāḻvār, well on the verge of entry into the destined land, the Heaven, would not rest on his oars but address the worldlings, out of deep compassion, with an eye on the spiritual uplift of one and all. He has indeed a recipe to suit every taste, seeing that men’s tastes differ according to their calibre and equipment—vide aphorism 227 of Ācārya Hṛdayam.




## Retrospective Summary
(9-1): Love unto the Godly men, dwelt upon, in the concluding decad of the eighth Centum, is automatically carried over to all those closely associated with them and the love so generated reverts to the Lord, as the One loved and revered by the devotees. And so, the Āḻvār illustrates copiously and in a telling manner, *in the opening decad of this centum*, the utter futility of our hanging on to the earthly relations and all else except the Supreme Lord Who alone is our Eternal Saviour and Sole Sustainer under all circumstances. The miserable hollowness of the ephemeral bonds of the earthly relations and associates, the veritable parasites, is exposed by the Āḻvār in all its nakedness. This decad is said to be in benedictive adoration of Mathurā, in Uttara Pradesh, in view of the frequent references to that holy centre, hallowed by its association with Vāmana and Kṛṣṇa; it was also the capital of the kingdom, ruled by Śatrugṇa, Lord Rāma’s youngest brother;

(9-2); With the awareness that the Lord stays in His worshippable (Iconic) Form in Tiruppuḷiṅkuṭi in order to extend to His votaries all the benefits which they could expect from their earthly relations, the Āḻvār now proceeds (mentally of course) to that holy centre, eager to become the recipient of the Lord’s love and attention. But then, the Lord remained unresponsive and yet, it did not detract from the Āḻvār’s immense faith in Him, as his all. What agitated the Āḻvār’s mind was the manner in which the Lord was reclining in the holy centre without changing sides, even once, by way of adjustment. Closetted with the Lord, in the shrine, the Āḻvār pleads with Him privately, *in the second decad*, that He should deign to move about, come forward a few paces, in the company of His Divine Consorts, greet him with His bewitching smiles and so on;

[Meaning apart, the diction of this decad (original text) is such as to melt even stony hearts. Those of us, who get caught up in the bewildering complexities of life, will do well to chant this decad and feel relieved and refreshed. How soothing are these verses indeed!]

(9-3): In the second decad, the Āḻvār fervently prayed that the Lord be pleased to turn His sweet glances on him, grant audience to him and the denizens of all the three worlds, remaining in a seated posture, beckon him or come down to him and permit him to stroke His lovely pair of feet and so on. The Lord, however, focussed his attention on the fundamental relationship that subsists between them, which hardly affords any scope for such entreaties by him and much less, for the grief that results from the Lord’s apparent non-compliance. The basic fact of the Lord being Nārāyaṇa, in whom all things and beings inhere and who abides in all, reduces all things and beings to the abject position of mere bodies unto the Life within, dominating, directing and supporting them. Consoled thus by the Lord, in quite a convincing manner, the Saint regains his composure and gives vent, *in the third decad*, to his rapturous admiration of Lord Nārāyaṇa, as our Sole Benefactor, His great concern for His subjects and loving condescension;

(9-4): Keen to maintain His reputation as the repository of the auspicious qualities of tender solicitude, etc., denoted by His name, Nārāyanā [Nārāyaṇa], (which come to the fore through the irresistible spell cast on Him by Goddess Mahālakṣmī) the Lord presented Himself to the Āḻvār. Overjoyed by the Lord’s presence (mental vḻsion), the Āḻvār gives vent, *in the fourth decad*, to his gratitude for the Lord having pressed him into service and got these hymns sung by him, for the edification of the pious. “What a bliss and that too, bestowed on a single individual!” is how the Āḻvār revolves in his mind;

(9-5): In the eighth song of the fourth decad, the Āḻvār referred to his having got the vision of Lord Kṛṣṇa, a by-gone Avatāra. This led him to the desire for external perception of the Lord as well, without being confined to a mere mental vision. It did not, however, materialise; worn out by dejection, due to this apparent desertion by the Lord, the Āḻvār tried to divert his mind by seeking the fellowship of things around, bearing the Lord’s likeness. But the very things, chosen for diversion, served only as incentives to remind the Āḻvār, all the more, about the Lord and thus torment him. We see the Āḻvār, *in the fifth decad*, in the plight of a female-lover, separated from the Lord after their erstwhile union, trying to sustain herself in the sweet environments of a lovely garden. But there, the warbling koel and the blue peacock remind the forlorn lover of the Lord’s sweet accents and charming complexion and she at once concludes that the Lord has set these creatures on her, just to make her collapse, pining for Him. She, therefore, asks them why they are at such great pains to put an end to her life which she would as well part with, at her own volition. Even so, the Nāyaki manages to pull through, recounting, in this decad, the Lord’s auspicious traits;

(9-6): It was only the absorbing recollection of the immensity of the Lord’s love, during their erstwhile union, experienced in the seventh decad of the eighth centum, that warmed up the Āḻvār. *In the sixth decad of this Centum*, the Āḻvār lauds the glory and greatness of the Deity enshrined in the pilgrim centre, called Tirukkāṭkarai (Kerala State), who kindled, in the Āḻvār, this kind of reminiscence and made him revert to the exhilarating mental state, as in VIĪI-7;

(9-7): While in a reminiscent mood, as in the sixth decad, the Āḻvār developed once more a deep yearning for direct perception of the Lord. This led him on to send emissaries, *in the seventh decad*, to the Lord in His Iconic Form at Tirumūḻikkaḷam (Kerala State), the accent resting on His enchanting beauty. Put briefly, the message, to be conveyed by the birds to the Lord, is:

“Oh, Sire, enshrined as you are, in Tirumūḻikkaḷam, You seem to have got completely absorbed in the company of your Consorts and proximate attendants, to the exclusion of poor Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī. Alas! the Nāyakī, enthralled by your exquisite beauty, can hardly brook separation from you, any longer. Please take note of this fact and do hasten to her”.

[*Note*: This is the last of the four decads in which messages were despatched to the Lord at different destinations, by the Alvar, figuratively transformed as a forlorn female lover, *the other three* being 1-4, VI-1 and VI-8],

(9-8): The Āḻvār could hardly contain the effervescence of God-love in him and patiently await the return of the emissaries sent by him to the Lord, in the seventh decad. And so, he tried to sustain himself by meeting the Lord, enshrined in Tirunāvāy (Kerala State). But, in his present state of desolation and debility, he could not make the trip to that pilgrim centre. The next best he could do, under the circumstances, was to meditate on the Lord at Tirunāvāy, right from where he was. This is precisely what he does *in the eighth decad*;

(9-9): It is evening when the cool, southerly breeze wafts the sweet fragrance of the jasmine, in full bloom and the lovely Moon is up in the sky. And then, there is the roaring of the sea, the tuneful cooing of the warbling birds, the distant sound of the bugle and a host of other things, which make that part of the day highly delectable. But all these normal instruments of happiness affect the frustrated Āḻvār adversely, as he could not gain access to Tirunāvāy, much as he longed for. And so, *in the ninth decad*, the Āḻvār experiences the pangs of separation, undergone by the Gopīs (Shepherd damsels), during those evenings, when Kṛṣṇa was a little late in returning home after tending the grazing cattle, by day. On certain evenings, Kṛṣṇa would retum at the head of the cattle, sounding the bugle, while, on other days, he would allow the cattle to go ahead and then walk behind them. Even that little prolongation of Kṛṣṇa’s absence, in the latter case, upset the Gopīs who suffered the anguish of an age. The Āḻvār is found, in this decad, experiencing singly all those pangs of Gopīs in the above context;

(9-10): Seeing the Āḻvār in dire distress, the Lord placated him by saying that He has come all the way from Heaven to near-by Tirukkaṇṇa-puram only for his sake and that He will surely accomplish his desire, at the end of his current span of life. Thus placated, the Āḻvār gives vent to his joy, *in the concluding decad oj this centum*. With his characteristic compassion for the sorrowing mankind, sunk deep in the ocean of Saṃsāra, he preaches unto them the path of loving surrender to the Lord who is easily accessible to one and all at the holy Tirukkaṇṇapuram, bent upon retrieving the votaries and assures them that even the mere mention of the name of that holy centre shall rid them of all, their sins and miseries.
