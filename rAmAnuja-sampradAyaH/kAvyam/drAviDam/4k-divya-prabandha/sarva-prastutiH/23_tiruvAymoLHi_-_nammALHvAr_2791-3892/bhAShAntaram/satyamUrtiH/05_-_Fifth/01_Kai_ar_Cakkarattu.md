## 00 Intro5.1
Through his brilliant exposition of the Lord’s Supremacy, in the last decad, the Āḻvār could wean away the worldlings from propitiating the minor deities and turn their attention to the Supreme Lord (Viṣṇu). The Āḻvār is about to sing the song of benediction for the new state of affairs to flourish in all its glory, vide V-2. Meanwhile, he draws the searchlight inwards to examine the root-cause of the extraordinary grace showered on him by the Lord, whereby he could not merely stand apart from the worldlings without wallowing as one of them, but also advise and correct them. This introspection, however, reveals that even for a mere show of piety by him devoid of genuine love for God, He has condescended to open up the floodgates of His grace on him, without caring in the least to go beneath the skin and expose his hollowness. The Āḻvār just marvels at the Lord’s overwhelming grace and gives vent to his wonderment, in this decad.




## 5.1.1
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கை ஆர் சக்கரத்து என் கருமாணிக்கமே! என்று என்று,  
பொய்யே கைம்மைசொல்லி புறமே புறமே ஆடி.  
மெய்யே பெற்றொழிந்தேன், விதி வாய்க்கின்று காப்பார் ஆர்,  
ஐயோ கண்ணபிரான்! அறையோ இனிப்போனாலே. (2)

kai ār cakkarattu eṉ karumāṇikkamē! eṉṟu eṉṟu,  
poyyē kaimmaicolli puṟamē puṟamē āṭi.  
meyyē peṟṟoḻintēṉ, viti vāykkiṉṟu kāppār ār,  
aiyō kaṇṇapirāṉ! aṟaiyō iṉippōṉālē. (2)

**English translation of verse 5.1.1:**

Still engrossed with pleasures sensual, I did sham  
Love unto you and called you out many a time,  
As my Lord of sapphire hue, holding the discus majestic and so on,  
And yet, you did your grace on this imposter rain  
As if I am genuine; ha! who can its influx resist?  
Oh, Kaṇṇapirāṉ, You can’t from me part hence, even if you insist.

**Note**

No doubt, the effulgent discus in the Lord’s exquisite hand and His sapphire hue are very attractive and can easily steal away the hearts of beholders. The Āḻvār’s heart, hard ḻike steel, is, however, impervious and yet he called out the Lord, not once, but several times, shamming the love of true devotees. Apart from this treachery of the tongue, the Āḻvār’s behaviour, as he puts it, was also most unworthy of the Lord’s grace. And yet, he now exults that he has been rewarded like the true devotees soaked in God-love, and exclaims that none can obstruct the influx of His voluntary grace, flowing with remarkable spontaniety. In this hour of victory the Āḻvār challenges, with a gusto, even the Lord to get parted from him, if He can! Did He not declare, as Śrī Rāma, on the seashore, that He would not give up any one who sought refuge in Him, even if the supplicant be a foe in the disguise of a friend, an imposter? It is not as if the omniscient Lord has been duped into believing a pretender and taking him at his face value. The truth is that, though He is Omnipotent, He elects to be incapable of abandoning the sinner, when the latter seeks His protection, half-heartedly though, in view of the eternal bond of relationship subsisting between the Creator and the Creature. Perfectly safe under the wings of the Lord’s mercy, the Āḻvār makes bold to declare that the Lord cannot tear Himself away from him.




## 5.1.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

போனாய் மாமருதின் நடுவே என் பொல்லா மணியே,  
தேனே! இன்அமுதே!' என்று என்றே சில கூத்துச்சொல்ல,  
தானேல் எம்பெருமான் அவன் என் ஆகி ஒழிந்தான்,  
வானே மாநிலமே, மற்றும்முற்றும் என் உள்ளனவே.

pōṉāy māmarutiṉ naṭuvē eṉ pollā maṇiyē,  
tēṉē! iṉamutē!' eṉṟu eṉṟē cila kūttuccolla,  
tāṉēl emperumāṉ avaṉ eṉ āki oḻintāṉ,  
vāṉē mānilamē, maṟṟummuṟṟum eṉ uḷḷaṉavē.

**English translation of verse 5.1.2:**

Shamming deep love, I called out the Lord  
As the One who ‘tween the twin trees crawled,  
My honey, nectar grand, gem of the purest ray serene  
And so on; lo! the Lord and His possessions have now become mine  
And the cosmic duties He carries out from within me.

### Note

The Divine child (Kṛṣṇa) was tied to a pounder by the Mother, as a punishment. But the child dragged it along and crawled in between two ‘Maruta’ trees and felled them. The Mother grew apprehensive of the safety of the child and it was, therefore, quite all right when she questioned the young one anxiously, ‘Ha! my darling, did you crawl between the trees?’ But the Āḻvār repeats it now, as if he had even a fraction of the concern of the Mother. How pretentious! And yet, the Omniscient Lord has been pleased to take him at his face value and unto him repaired with all His retinue and got inside him. The Āḻvār wonders how this could be. (In him that is charged with God-love, the entire world of God stands illumined. This is now demonstrated.)




## 5.1.3
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

உள்ளன மற்று உளவா புறமே சில மாயம் சொல்லி,  
வள்ளல் மணிவண்ணனே! என்று என்றே உன்னையும் வஞ்சிக்கும்,  
கள்ள மனம் தவிர்ந்தே உன்னைக் கண்டுகொண்டு உய்ந்தொழிந்தேன்,  
வெள்ளத்து அணைக்கிடந்தாய் இனி உன்னை விட்டு என் கொள்வனே?

uḷḷaṉa maṟṟu uḷavā puṟamē cila māyam colli,  
vaḷḷal maṇivaṇṇaṉē! eṉṟu eṉṟē uṉṉaiyum vañcikkum,  
kaḷḷa maṉam tavirntē uṉṉaik kaṇṭukoṇṭu uyntoḻintēṉ,  
veḷḷattu aṇaikkiṭantāy iṉi uṉṉai viṭṭu eṉ koḷvaṉē?

**English translation of verse 5.1.3:**

My Lord, resting on serpent-bed in the milk-ocean,  
My mind was in other things steeped, but time and again  
I tried to deceive you and uttered words insincere  
Calling you out, oh, my Lord of sapphire hue, generous Sire,  
And so on; with a mind by you redeemed and rendered pure,  
You I now enjoy, I can’t from you be apart any more.

### Note

With a mind duly reconditioned by the Lord, purged of all its erstwhile grossness, dirt and delivery, the Āḻvār says, he cannot think of any but the most delectable Lord and there is no question of his giving up One who has such a strong hold on him and running after others who are hardly adorable and having nothing to grant, even if adored.




## 5.1.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

என் கொள்வன் உன்னை விட்டு என்னும் வாசகங்கள் சொல்லியும்,  
வன் கள்வனேன் மனத்தை வலித்து கண்ண நீர் கரந்து,  
நின்கண் நெருங்கவைத்தே எனது ஆவியை நீக்ககில்லேன்,  
என்கண் மலினம் அறுத்து என்னைக்கூவி அருளாய்கண்ணனே!

eṉ koḷvaṉ uṉṉai viṭṭu eṉṉum vācakaṅkaḷ colliyum,  
vaṉ kaḷvaṉēṉ maṉattai valittu kaṇṇa nīr karantu,  
niṉkaṇ neruṅkavaittē eṉatu āviyai nīkkakillēṉ,  
eṉkaṇ maliṉam aṟuttu eṉṉaikkūvi aruḷāykaṇṇaṉē!

**English translation of verse 5.1.4:**

Oh Kaṇṇā, I, a terrible thief, uttered words insincere  
That I would think of none but you and now, may I implore  
That you do forcibly reclaim my wayward mind with its woeful tears  
And fix it on you besides ridding me of nescience dark  
And lifting me up to you, away from the mesh intricate  
(Of worldly life), whence my soul I am unable to extricate.

### Note

There are two ways of appreciating the genesis of this song. The first is: “My Lord, You have no doubt redeemed my mind but I am still apprehensive of slipping back to my old ways, because of the impact of this material body and the mundane surroundings. I, therefore, pray that you be pleased to steer me clear of the material contacts and lift me up to your feet in Heaven”. The other elucidation is: In the preceding song, the Alvar declared that he had attained the Lord from whom he could not be separated any more. But that was only a mental appreciation while the Āḻvār longed for physical contact as well and actually held out his hand to clasp the Lord. The Lord could not be got hold of physically and the Āḻvār was quick to realise that it was not possible because of his material shackles. Hence, he prays unto the Lord to cut these out and make him stay at His feet for ever.

*Terrible thief*: The Āḻvār played the thief in two ways: While he was actually steeped in sensual pleasures, he addressed the Lord, professing great piety, that he thought of none but Him and things of that sort. Again, by holding himself as the Master of his soul which actually vested in the Lord, he had committed theft, a serious one, at that. The magnitude of a theft is determined by the value of the thing stolen and the rank and eminence of its owner. Seeing that the Jiva (Individual Soul) is the coveted possession of the Supreme Lord, the theft committed by the Āḻvār is terrible indeed.

It is indeed a very difficult task to wean the mind away from its escapades and ungodly pursuits and the Āḻvār has given it up, as one much beyond his capacity. Only the Almighty Lord could do it and hence His intervention has been sought.




## 5.1.5
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கண்ணபிரானை விண்ணோர் கருமாணிக்கத்தை அமுதை,  
நண்ணியும் நண்ணகில்லேன் நடுவே ஓர் உடம்பில் இட்டு,  
திண்ணம் அழுந்தக் கட்டிப் பல செய்வினை வன் கயிற்றால்,  
புண்ணை மறையவரிந்து என்னைப் போர வைத்தாய் புறமே.

kaṇṇapirāṉai viṇṇōr karumāṇikkattai amutai,  
naṇṇiyum naṇṇakillēṉ naṭuvē ōr uṭampil iṭṭu,  
tiṇṇam aḻuntak kaṭṭip pala ceyviṉai vaṉ kayiṟṟāl,  
puṇṇai maṟaiyavarintu eṉṉaip pōra vaittāy puṟamē.

**English translation of verse 5.1.5:**

Oh, Kaṇṇā, I am near yet far from my nectar sweet,  
The blue gem by Celestials adored, being put by you aside,  
In a body by violent desires bound, neat outside  
But full of dirt within and in blinding ignorance rendered weak.

**Note**

In this song, the Āḻvār expatiates on the heinous material contacts, referred to in the previous song. In the first two lines, he draws a picture of God-head, with melting tenderness, while, in the next two lines, he speaks of his own inglorious material shackles, with great abhorrence. Neatly cloaked outside, this body is but a bundle of guts and glands, blood and bones, nerves and muscles, dirt and delivery. But for the skin outside, it would become an easy prey to the greedy crows and man’s whole occupation would then be to keep off the crows from pecking at the human flesh. This body stands as a big barrier between the Āḻvār and the Lord and therefore it is that the Āḻvār lustily pleads for its removal.




## 5.1.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

புறம் அறக் கட்டிக்கொண்டு இரு வல்வினையார் குமைக்கும்,  
முறை முறை யாக்கை புகல்ஒழியக் கண்டு கொண்டொழிந்தேன்,  
நிறம் உடை நால்தடம்தோள் செய்யவாய் செய்ய தாமரைக்கண்,  
அறம்முயல் ஆழிஅங்கைக் கருமேனி அம்மான் தன்னையே.

puṟam aṟak kaṭṭikkoṇṭu iru valviṉaiyār kumaikkum,  
muṟai muṟai yākkai pukaloḻiyak kaṇṭu koṇṭoḻintēṉ,  
niṟam uṭai nāltaṭamtōḷ ceyyavāy ceyya tāmaraikkaṇ,  
aṟammuyal āḻiaṅkaik karumēṉi ammāṉ taṉṉaiyē.

**English translation of verse 5.1.6:**

Seen have I my Sire of sapphire hue with shoulders four,  
Broad and lovely, coral lips, lotus eyes red and hands comely,  
Wielding the discus dutiful and thus cut out the entry  
Into this body, of actions good and bad that seek to enter  
By turns and get badly mixed up, hard to decipher.

### Notes

\(i\) The Āḻvār, who grieved over his serious handicap, the material shackles, in the two preceding songs, was compensated by the Lord, when He blessed him with the vision of His exquisite Form. In the resultant joy, the Āḻvār drowned his erstwhile miseries.

\(ii\) The so-called merit (Puṇya) and demerit (Pāpa) play havoc with this body, the seat of action, the one being as fettering as the other. A golden fetter is a fetter all the same.

\(iii\) The Āḻvār feels that the Lord is embracing him and His shoulders are thus mentioned first. Then He addresses sweet words and casts sweet glances and, in this very sequence, the Āḻvār refers to the Lord’s coral lips and lotus eyes. The hands wielding the discus, a prominent member of the Lord’s protection force, are mentioned next.




## 5.1.7
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அம்மான் ஆழிப்பிரான் அவன் எவ் இடத்தான்? யான் ஆர்?,  
எம் மா பாவியர்க்கும் விதி வாய்க்கின்று வாய்க்கும் கண்டீர்,  
'கைம்மா துன்பு ஒழித்தாய்!' என்று கைதலைபூசல் இட்டே,  
மெய்ம் மால் ஆயொழிந்தேன் எம்பிரானும் என் மேலானே.

ammāṉ āḻippirāṉ avaṉ ev iṭattāṉ? yāṉ ār?,  
em mā pāviyarkkum viti vāykkiṉṟu vāykkum kaṇṭīr,  
'kaimmā tuṉpu oḻittāy!' eṉṟu kaitalaipūcal iṭṭē,  
meym māl āyoḻintēṉ empirāṉum eṉ mēlāṉē.

**English translation of verse 5.1.7:**

How great is the Lord wielding the discus  
And how unworthy am I and yet, how gracious  
That He, my Benefactor great, should His grace immense shed  
Unto me, a sinner great! with joined palms overhead  
I did, in hollowness address Him, as the one who rescued  
The elephant in great distress and a devotee true  
He has turned me, with love immense unto Him!

### Notes

\(i\) One can’t but shrink back while contrasting one’s own abject lowliness with the Lord’s peerless excellence. Reciting the first line of the original text of this song.

Piḻḻai-amutaṉar would exclaim: “How great and worthy He is, the Lord wielding the discus!” raising his arms up, pointing to heaven and then drop them down earthward, saying “how vile and unworthy I am!” And yet, when His grace descends and overflows its continents, this enormous disparity is more than made up. Then it is all one vast expanse of water (grace), where the high and low, big and small, cannot be differentiated. Śrī Vedānta Deśika would appear to echo the substance of this song in Śloka 65 of his ‘Dayā śatakaṃ’, where he has observed that inundation of the Lord’s grace has rendered one and all, big and low, quite even, all of them having been submerged under the vast expanse of His grace-people of low stature like Guha, the hunter chief, Sugrīva, the monkey King, a jungle inhabitant, named Śabari, kucela, the famished brahmin in rags, Kubjā, the malformed maid of Kaṃsa’s establishment, the young Gopīs of Vraja, Mālākāra, the flower vendor etc., on the one hand, and Lord Śrīnivāsa Himself at that charming eminence, known as Tiruvēṅkaṭam, on the other.

\(ii\) The Lord’s grace becomes all the more lustrous and pronounced, when it embraces even fakes like the Āḻvār (as he puts it). He just feigned devotion and referred to the Lord’s rescue of Gajendra in distress, though not with the intense feeling of a true devotee whose heart can’t but melt down at the Lord’s posthaste arrival in the pond which was the scene of a titanic struggle between the elephant and a crocodile. The Lord pounced upon the Āḻvār even as a famished fellow pounces upon food.




## 5.1.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மேலாத் தேவர்களும் நிலத் தேவரும் மேவித் தொழும்,  
மாலார் வந்து இனநாள் அடியேன் மனத்தே மன்னினார்,  
சேல் ஏய் கண்ணியரும் பெரும் செல்வமும் நன்மக்களும்,  
மேலாத் தாய் தந்தையும் அவரே இனி ஆவாரே.

mēlāt tēvarkaḷum nilat tēvarum mēvit toḻum,  
mālār vantu iṉanāḷ aṭiyēṉ maṉattē maṉṉiṉār,  
cēl ēy kaṇṇiyarum perum celvamum naṉmakkaḷum,  
mēlāt tāy tantaiyum avarē iṉi āvārē.

**English translation of verse 5.1.8:**

The Lord, by the exalted Celestials and Brahmins revered  
And adored, now in my heart lovingly inheres;  
He is from now on, Aḷḷ-in-one unto me,  
The fish-eyed damsels, riches big, adorable parents and sweet progeny.

### Note

The Lord, lovingly worshipped by vast multitudes in Heaven and the pious brahmins on Earth, has condescended to exhibit even greater love unto the Āḻvār than to them all. What is more, He has got right inside the Āḻvār. Little wonder then that the Āḻvār looks upon the Lord as the aggregate of all happiness derived by the earthlings through various sources, Father, Mother, Wife and all these.




## 5.1.9
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஆவார் ஆர் துணை என்று அலை நீர்க் கடலுள் அழுந்தும்-  
நாவாய் போல், பிறவிக்கடலுள் நின்று நான் துளங்க,  
தேவு ஆர் கோலத்தொடும் திருச் சக்கரம் சங்கினொடும்,  
ஆஆ என்று அருள்செய்து அடியேனொடும் ஆனானே.

āvār ār tuṇai eṉṟu alai nīrk kaṭaluḷ aḻuntum-  
nāvāy pōl, piṟavikkaṭaluḷ niṉṟu nāṉ tuḷaṅka,  
tēvu ār kōlattoṭum tiruc cakkaram caṅkiṉoṭum,  
āā eṉṟu aruḷceytu aṭiyēṉoṭum āṉāṉē.

**English translation of verse 5.1.9:**

Like unto a ship sinking in the surging ocean,  
With none going to its rescue, I was struggling hard  
In the ocean of worldly life when the resplendent Lord,  
Wielding Conch and Discus and bursting with compassion,  
Shed unto me His grace and in me joined, in a state of fusion.

### Note

The Āḻvār gratefully acknowledges the supreme grace of the Lord in dispelling all his erstwhile miseries by exhibiting His exquisite charm and entering his person, making His union with him just as natural and perfect as His holding the glorious weapons-Conch and Discus.




## 5.1.10
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஆனான் ஆளுடையான் என்று அஃதே கொண்டு உகந்துவந்து  
தானே இன்அருள் செய்து என்னை முற்றவும் தான் ஆனான்,  
மீன் ஆய் ஆமையும் ஆய் நரசிங்கமும் ஆய் குறள் ஆய்,  
கான் ஆர் ஏனமும் ஆய் கற்கி ஆம் இன்னம் கார் வண்ணனே.

āṉāṉ āḷuṭaiyāṉ eṉṟu aḵtē koṇṭu ukantuvantu  
tāṉē iṉaruḷ ceytu eṉṉai muṟṟavum tāṉ āṉāṉ,  
mīṉ āy āmaiyum āy naraciṅkamum āy kuṟaḷ āy,  
kāṉ ār ēṉamum āy kaṟki ām iṉṉam kār vaṇṇaṉē.

**English translation of verse 5.1.10:**

That the cloud-hued Lord has me His vassal made  
I gratefully uttered and He has His grace on me shed  
Most lovingly and unto me become everything delicious;  
He is the One who did incarnate as Fish, Wild Boar, Tortoise,  
Man-Lion and Midget and will, as Kalki, appear in due course.

### Note

The age-long efforts of the Lord, an indefatigable cultivator, to redeem and reclaim the Āḻvār, have, at long last, yielded results. The Āḻvār who is now God-bent, gratefully acknowledges the Lord’s herculean efforts. And this simple gesture of the Āḻvār has drawn the Lord inside him, where He lovingly stays, firm and fast. This is, however, nothing new for the Lord who spared no pains in the process of sustentation and incarnated in various forms. Even as the clouds go on unleashing the rains, the cloud-hued Lord will not stop with the many incarnations already made by Him; He will also incarnate as Kalki hereafter. Looking at all the past incarnations of the Lord as those solely directed towards the Āḻvār’s reclamation, His future Avatāra as ‘Kalki’ would seem to be superfluous but it is not so, being intended as a safeguard or corrective against the possible future pit-falls, as long as the Āḻvār remains in this abode.




## 5.1.11
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கார்வண்ணன் கண்ண பிரான் கமலத்தடங்கண்ணன் தன்னை,  
ஏர்வள ஒண்கழனிக் குருகூர்ச் சடகோபன் சொன்ன,  
சீர் வண்ணம் ஒண்தமிழ்கள் இவை ஆயிரத்துள் இப்பத்தும்  
ஆர்வண்ணத்தால் உரைப்பார் அடிக்கீழ்ப் புகுவார் பொலிந்தே.

cīr vaṇṇam oṇtamiḻkaḷ ivai āyirattuḷ ippattum  
ārvaṇṇattāl uraippār aṭikkīḻp pukuvār polintē.

**English translation of verse 5.1.11:**

Those that lovingly recite these songs ten,  
Out of the perfect thousand Tamiḻ songs, composed by Caṭakōpaṉ  
Of Kurukūr, with fertile fields where many a plough plies.  
Adoring Kaṇṇaṉ, the cloud-hued Lord with lotus eyes.  
Will remain pious unto Him and His feet attain.

### Note

Those that recite these ten songs with intense love, as if they are drinking nectar, will remain pious Śrī Vaiṣṇavas during their stay here, and attain the Lord’s feet, like unto children reposing on the mother’s lap.
