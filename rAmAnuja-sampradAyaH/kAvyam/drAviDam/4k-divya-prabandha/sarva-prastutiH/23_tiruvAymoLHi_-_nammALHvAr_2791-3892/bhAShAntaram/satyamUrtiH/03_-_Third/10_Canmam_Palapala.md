## 00 Intro3.10
The Lord is most eminently suited for laudation by virtue of His innumerable auspicious traits, wondrous deeds and vast possessions. And yet, the worldlings would not listen to the Āḻvār’s advice, as in the preceding decad, to praise Him exclusively and desist from praising others. The Āḻvār, however, felt happy that he could at least get back from them unscathed without following in their footsteps. That spirit of complacence tuns through this decad also with an extra gusto. The Āḻvār gives expression to the various benefits accrued to him through his total absorption in the Lord, namely, full and complete freedom from (1) want, (2) obstruction in the enjoyment of the Lord, (3) trouble, (4) sorrow, (5) affliction. (6) hindrance, (7) fatigue etc.




## 3.10.1
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

சன்மம் பலபல செய்து வெளிப்பட்டு சங்கொடு சக்கரம்வில்,  
ஒண்மை உடைய உலக்கை ஒள்வாள் தண்டு கொண்டு புள் ஊர்ந்து, உலகில்  
வன்மை உடைய அரக்கர் அசுரரை மாளப் படைபொருத,  
நன்மை உடையவன் சீர் பரவப்பெற்ற நான் ஓர் குறைவு இலனே.

caṉmam palapala ceytu veḷippaṭṭu caṅkoṭu cakkaramvil,  
oṇmai uṭaiya ulakkai oḷvāḷ taṇṭu koṇṭu puḷ ūrntu, ulakil  
vaṉmai uṭaiya arakkar acurarai māḷap paṭaiporuta,  
naṉmai uṭaiyavaṉ cīr paravappeṟṟa nāṉ ōr kuṟaivu ilaṉē.

**English translation of verse 3.10.1:**

Singing the glory of the benevolent Lord  
Who took many a birth, visible unto (he eyes naked  
Of the worldly, wielding the sword, the mace.  
The pounder blight, bow, conch and discus  
And slew, flying that bird (Garuḍa), the Asuras and the fiends  
Free from wants of any kind am I indeed.

**Notes**

\(i\) While the Lord incarnates as a matter of grace we are born under compulsion, as the result of our past Karmas (deeds), to eke out our load. But by the Lord’s spontaneous grace, the cycle of birth and rebirth will, some day, be brought to a halt in our case, and we won’t have any more births, having once reached the Eternal Land (Heaven) whence there is no returning. The Lord, however, goes on taking births assuming the Form most appropriate to His needs. While recounting the Lord’s Avatāras (incarnations) carrying about His person the unique weapons of transcendent fame, the Āḻvār feels that he is above wants of any kind. As a matter of fact, only those can suffer from wants, who are either devilish (āsurik) or are running after petty men for paltry gains.

\(ii\) *The fiends*: Those whose hearts are hard like a rock impervious to the exquisite charm of the Lord’s enthralling Form, and who become the targets of His bow and not of His beauty.




## 3.10.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

குறைவு இல் தடங்கடல் கோள் அரவு ஏறி தன் கோலச் செந்தாமரைக்கண்,  
உறைபவன் போல ஓர் யோகு புணர்ந்த ஒளி மணி வண்ணன் கண்ணன்,  
கறை அணி மூக்கு உடைப் புள்ளைக் கடாவி அசுரரைக் காய்ந்த அம்மான்,  
நிறை புகழ் ஏத்தியும் பாடியும் ஆடியும் யான் ஒரு முட்டு இலனே.

kuṟaivu il taṭaṅkaṭal kōḷ aravu ēṟi taṉ kōlac centāmaraikkaṇ,

kaṟai aṇi mūkku uṭaip puḷḷaik kaṭāvi acuraraik kāynta ammāṉ,  
niṟai pukaḻ ēttiyum pāṭiyum āṭiyum yāṉ oru muṭṭu ilaṉē.

**English translation of verse 3.10.2:**

Hindrance there’s none for me to sing,  
Dance and enjoy my lustrous Lord, full of fame, resting  
On the serpent-bed in the milk-ocean, full and broad,  
Closing the red-lotus eyes, in deep thoughts absorbed,  
Who came down here as Kaṇṇaṉ and destroyed  
The fell Asuras, mounted on that bird with beak bloody.

**Notes**

\(i\) The Lord reposed on His serpent-bed in the Milk-ocean in ‘*Yoga niddhrā*”, preparatory to His incarnation as Śrī Kṛṣṇa to destroy the evil forces arrayed against the Godly men. The Āḻvār recounting, as he does, the great glory of Lord Kṛṣṇa, says that He has cut out all the impediments for his continual enjoyment of this bliss.

\(ii\) *In deep thoughts absorbed*: The Lord’s ‘Yoga niddhrā’ referred to in (i) above is not the tāmasik variety of sleep but the highest form of activity, being the activisation of one’s energies inward. Deeply absorbed in finding out the sure solvent for winning over the straying subjects, tossed up in ‘the ocean of samsāra’, and taking them ashore, He visualised the enchanting form which would cast its irresistible spell on the worldlings and wean them. It was this very form He assumed and came down as Kṛṣṇa. In his inimitable diction, Nampiḷḷai observes that the Lord’s tongue got parched up due to His deep mental exertion in concerting the ways and means of redeeming the worldlings and just then, this enchanting form passed before His mind’s eye, like the edible camphor relieving the dryness of the tongue in an exhilarating manner.

\(iii\) *That bird with bleak bloody*: The blood-stains on the beak of the mighty Garuḍa caused by his slaying the opponents, has not been wiped off, there being hardly any time left for it. Far from presenting an untidy appearance, these stains seem to be decorative.




## 3.10.3
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

முட்டு இல் பல் போகத்து ஒரு தனி நாயகன் மூவுலகுக்கு உரிய,  
கட்டியை தேனை அமுதை நன்பாலை கனியை கரும்பு தன்னை,  
மட்டு அவிழ் தண் அம் துழாய் முடியானை வணங்கி அவன் திறத்துப்  
பட்ட பின்னை இறையாகிலும் யான் என் மனத்துப் பரிவு இலனே.

muṭṭu il pal pōkattu oru taṉi nāyakaṉ mūvulakukku uriya,  
kaṭṭiyai tēṉai amutai naṉpālai kaṉiyai karumpu taṉṉai,  
maṭṭu aviḻ taṇ am tuḻāy muṭiyāṉai vaṇaṅki avaṉ tiṟattup  
paṭṭa piṉṉai iṟaiyākilum yāṉ eṉ maṉattup parivu ilaṉē.

**English translation of verse 3.10.3:**

Mental afflictions have 1 absolutely none, absorbed in my Lord  
Whose cool tuḻaci garland sheds honey in plenty;  
Full of bliss uninterrupled, He is unto all the worlds  
The peerless Master, delicious like hoṇcy and candy,  
Pure milk, fruit, nectar, sugar cane and all that.

**Notes**

\(i\) The Āḻvār declares that, attracted as he is by the Lord’s extraordinary sweetness and steeped in His service, he is absolutely free from mental afflictions. Even the heavenly bliss he is having right here.

\(ii\) *Of bliss uninterrupted*: Unlike the felicities of all the others, including the exalted Devas like Indra, Brahmā and Śiva, which have their limitations both in regard to the quantum and duration, the Lord is a perennial fountain of inexhaustible bliss.

\(iii\) While the cool, honey-studded tuḷaci garland brings out the sweetness of the Lord’s Form (Divyamaṅgala vigraha), the other ‘Rasas’ (tastes) mentioned in the last two lines denote the highly delicious and delectable ‘Ātmasvarūpa’ or attributes of the Lord.




## 3.10.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

',பரிவு இன்றி வாணனைக் காத்தும்' என்று அன்று படையொடும் வந்து எதிர்ந்த  
திரிபுரம் செற்றவனும் மகனும் பின்னும் அங்கியும் போர் தொலைய,  
பொருசிறைப் புள்ளைக் கடாவிய மாயனை ஆயனை பொன் சக்கரத்து  
அரியினை, அச்சுதனைப் பற்றி யான் இறையேனும் இடர் இலனே.

',parivu iṉṟi vāṇaṉaik kāttum' eṉṟu aṉṟu paṭaiyoṭum vantu etirnta  
tiripuram ceṟṟavaṉum makaṉum piṉṉum aṅkiyum pōr tolaiya,  
poruciṟaip puḷḷaik kaṭāviya māyaṉai āyaṉai poṉ cakkarattu  
ariyiṉai, accutaṉaip paṟṟi yāṉ iṟaiyēṉum iṭar ilaṉē.

**English translation of verse 3.10.4:**

Distraction there’s none whatever for me,  
The votary of the wondrous Lord, Accutaṉ, (the steadfast),  
Ari, whose discus lovely destroys the enemies;  
As Kṛṣṇa, mounted on that valiant bird. He made them all eat the dust,  
(Śiva), the destroyer of Tiripuram, his son and Aṅki, ranged opposite,  
As sworn allies of the demoniac Vāṇaṉ, in a distant past.

**Notes**

\(i\) The Āḻvār brings out here that the lesser deities can hardly protect their votaries while the Supreme Lord, ‘Accuta’ sure and steadfast, will never give up His devotees. The Āḻvār, therefore, feels he is in a very happy position, absolutely safe, free from obstruction of any kind.

\(ii\) Uṣā, the charming daughter of Bāṇāsura (Vāṇaṉ, in Tamil) fell madly in love with a very handsome youth during a dream, and insisted that her mate Citralekhā, of extraordinary occult powers, should arrange for the physical presentation of the youth of her (Uṣā’s) dream. The figure of the youth in question having been projected on paper from the canvas of Uṣā’s mind, Citralekha identified him with Aniruddha, the grandson of Lord Kṛṣṇa and managed to lift the youngster bodily, along with the cot on which he was fast asleep, and put him right in Uṣā’s private apartment. With her dream realised, Uṣā was in the land of ecstasy in the company of her lover but when Bāṇāsura came to know of this intrusion, great was his wrath and he bound Aniruddha by a ‘Nāgāstra’, a serpent-missile. The whole of Dwāraka, Lord Kṛṣṇa’s township got agitated over the disappearance of Aniruddha and when Sage Nārada acquainted Śrī Kṛṣṇa with the youth’s whereabouts, the mighty Garuḍa was commissioned from Heaven. Mounted on Garuḍa, Kṛṣṇa, accompanied by a host of others, sallied forth to Bāṇāsura’s citadel to recover the missing youth. But Śiva, his son, Subramaṇya, their attendants, Agni (Aṅki, in Tamil) and other Devas ranged themselves on the side of Bāṇāsura, having vouchsafed protection unto him. Śrī Kṛṣṇa put Śiva out of action through a missile (Jṛmbhanāstra [*jṛmbhana-astra*]) making him yawn all the time, drove the rest away and finally encountered the thousand-armed Bāṇāsura, lopping off his aims. A penitent Śiva then prayed to Śrī Kṛṣṇa, and at the former’s request, Bāṇāsura was let off with a mere four arms, as against the thousand, he had before. The grateful Bāṇāsura gave his daughter in marriage to Aniruddha and ṭhe wedding was celebrated with great eclat.

Śiva’s part in this episode was indeed most unfortunate. When the milk-ocean was churned Lord Viṣṇu functioned in eight different forms. Likewise, when Śiva encountered Tripurāsuras and destroyed their flying citadels, Viṣṇu imparted the requisite strength to Śiva’s bow, toughness to the bow-string, sharpness to the arrow and above all, He was within him as the Internal Controller, as ever. But when Śiva was extolled by the ignorant poets as the destroyer of Tripura, he got infatuated to such an extent that he was impudent enough to think in terms of taking up arms against Kṛṣṇa, Lord Viṣṇu, incarnate and allying with Bāṇāsura. No doubt, Śiva had to repent for it, as seen from the episode cited above.

\(iii\) *Distraction, there is none for me*: Despite being Lord Kṛṣṇa’s grandson, Aniruddha had to suffer imprisonment at the hands of Bāṇāsura, as in the above episode. But, as the Lord’s ardent devotee, the Āḻvār doesn’t have to suffer any such indignity.




## 3.10.5
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

இடர் இன்றியே ஒரு நாள் ஒரு போழ்தில் எல்லா உலகும் கழிய,  
படர் புகழ்ப் பார்த்தனும் வைதிகனும் உடன் ஏற திண்தேர்கடவி,  
சுடர் ஒளியாய் நின்ற தன்னுடைச் சோதியில் வைதிகன் பிள்ளைகளை,  
உடலொடும் கொண்டு கொடுத்தவனைப் பற்றி ஒன்றும் துயர் இலனே.

iṭar iṉṟiyē oru nāḷ oru pōḻtil ellā ulakum kaḻiya,  
paṭar pukaḻp pārttaṉum vaitikaṉum uṭaṉ ēṟa tiṇtērkaṭavi,  
cuṭar oḷiyāy niṉṟa taṉṉuṭaic cōtiyil vaitikaṉ piḷḷaikaḷai,  
uṭaloṭum koṇṭu koṭuttavaṉaip paṟṟi oṉṟum tuyar ilaṉē.

**English translation of verse 3.10.5:**

In me there isn’t the slightest tinge of grief,  
Having attained my gracious Lord who delivered  
The lost sons of a ‘Vaidik’ back to him quite safe,  
Taking him and Arjuna in a chariot strong that covered  
The upper regions, reclaiming from the Heaven resplendent the sons (four).

**Notes**

\(i\) The Āḻvār asserts that there is no question of his being confronted by grief of any kind, having taken sole refuge in the Supreme Lord, Who, as Kṛṣṇa, went light into Heaven, reclaimed the four missing sons of a ‘Vaidik’ (Brahmin) and delivered them back to him as promised.

\(ii\) The ‘Vaidik’, referred to in (i) above, lost three sons successively; immediately they emerged from the mother’s womb, the babes disappeared. When his wife conceived again, the Brahmin prayed to Śrī Kṛṣṇa to ensure the safe retention of at least the current progeny. At the time of confinement, however, Arjuna dissuaded Kṛṣṇa from disengaging himself from a ritual currently going on and undertook to look after the Vaidik’s affair himself. But then, Arjuna failed miserably despite his standing guard at the Vaidik’s house, blocking, with arrows, entry into the house by any outsider, not even air. The progeny disappeared as usual soon after emergence from the mother’s womb.

The Vaidik bitterly reproached Arjuna but Kṛṣṇa appeased the grief-stricken brahmin, promising to get him back all the four missing children. Just in one day the three of them ascended the upper regions in a mighty chariot specially commissioned for the purpose. Detaining the Vaidik, Arjuna and the Chariot Just outside Heaven, Śri Kṛṣṇa alone entered the dazzling Heaven and located all the four children in the company of His Divine Consorts there, who longed for seeing Him in the exquisite Formof Kṛṣṇa and lifted the Vaidik’s sons, one by one, unto Heaven, in order to secure their objective. The children were thus recovered, safe and sound, and restored to the Vaidik, a grand and thrilling feat which none but the Supreme Lord could perform.




## 3.10.7
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

துன்பமும் இன்பமும் ஆகிய செய்வினை ஆய் உலகங்களும் ஆய்,  
இன்பம் இல் வெம் நரகு ஆகி இனிய நல் வான் சுவர்க்கங்களும் ஆய்  
மன் பல் உயிர்களும் ஆகி பலபல மாய மயக்குக்களால்,  
இன்புறும் இவ் விளையாட்டு உடையானைப் பெற்று ஏதும் அல்லல் இலனே.

tuṉpamum iṉpamum ākiya ceyviṉai āy ulakaṅkaḷum āy,  
iṉpam il vem naraku āki iṉiya nal vāṉ cuvarkkaṅkaḷum āy  
maṉ pal uyirkaḷum āki palapala māya mayakkukkaḷāl,  
iṉpuṟum iv viḷaiyāṭṭu uṭaiyāṉaip peṟṟu ētum allal ilaṉē.

**English translation of verse 3.10.7:**

Sorrows have I none, as I commune  
With my Lord, the Sportive Controller overall,  
Of the Creatures many, their pleasure and pain.  
Their acts, good and bad, the pleasant Svarga and dire hell.

**Note**

The Lord who delights in the creation of the Universe as a pastime, is in over-all control of the acts, good and bad, of His subjects, the reward and punishments therefor, the seats of enjoyment of the reward (Svarg [*svarga*]) and infliction of punishment (Hell) and so cn. Having attained Him, the Āḻvār avers that he is free from sorrows of any kind, rid of the bonds of Karma, the fountain source of all sufferings, through His unfailing grace.




## 3.10.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அல்லல் இல் இன்பம் அளவு இறந்து எங்கும் அழகு அமர் சூழ் ஒளியன்,  
அல்லி மலர் மகள் போக மயக்குக்கள் ஆகியும் நிற்கும் அம்மான்,  
எல்லை இல் ஞானத்தன் ஞானம் அஃதே கொண்டு எல்லாக் கருமங்களும் செய்,  
எல்லை இல் மாயனை கண்ணனைத் தாள் பற்றி யான் ஓர் துக்கம் இலனே.

allal il iṉpam aḷavu iṟantu eṅkum aḻaku amar cūḻ oḷiyaṉ,  
alli malar makaḷ pōka mayakkukkaḷ ākiyum niṟkum ammāṉ,  
ellai il ñāṉattaṉ ñāṉam aḵtē koṇṭu ellāk karumaṅkaḷum cey,  
ellai il māyaṉai kaṇṇaṉait tāḷ paṟṟi yāṉ ōr tukkam ilaṉē.

**English translation of verse 3.10.8:**

I have nothing to worry, worshipping, as I do, the feet compact  
Of the Lord of bliss unalloyed and beauty unlimited,  
Permeating all over, who is rapturous in contact  
With (Lakṣmī), the lotus-born, of radiant knowledge unlimited  
By which He, the work-a-day worlds does create  
Who did as wondrous Kaṇṇaṉ of glory unlimited incarnate.

**Notes**

\(i\) *Bliss unalloyed*: This obtains only in Heaven. Even Svarga, the seat of enjoyment of the reward for one’s good acts, known to be pleasurable, does not provide unalloyed happiness, as the inmates are haunted by the fear of being thrown out at the end of the prescribed tenure of their stay there. This fear gathers momentum every time a fellow-being is hurled down.

\(ii\) The Lord is, no doubt, the natural embodiment of bliss (Ānanda) but it is only His conjunction with Lakṣmī of ravishing beauty that confers on Him, the bliss supreme (Paramānanda). It is this blissful conjunction, *par excellence*, that provides the necessary incentive for His creation of the Sportive Universe (Līlā Vibhūti). Although He could create the entire Universe by a mere resolve (Saṅkalpa), He came down as Kṛṣṇa, and enthralled every one by His entrancing beauty. As an ardent worshipper of Lord Kṛṣṇa, the Āḻvār confidently asserts that he has absolutely nothing to worry about.




## 3.10.9
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

துக்கம் இல் ஞானச் சுடர் ஒளி மூர்த்தி துழாய் அலங்கல் பெருமான்,  
மிக்க பல் மாயங்களால் விகிர்தம் செய்து வேண்டும் உருவு கொண்டு,  
நக்க பிரானோடு அயன் முதலாக எல்லாரும் எவையும், தன்னுள்  
ஒக்க ஒடுங்க விழுங்க வல்லானைப் பெற்று ஒன்றும் தளர்வு இலனே.

tukkam il ñāṉac cuṭar oḷi mūrtti tuḻāy alaṅkal perumāṉ,  
mikka pal māyaṅkaḷāl vikirtam ceytu vēṇṭum uruvu koṇṭu,  
nakka pirāṉōṭu ayaṉ mutalāka ellārum evaiyum, taṉṉuḷ  
okka oṭuṅka viḻuṅka vallāṉaip peṟṟu oṉṟum taḷarvu ilaṉē.

**English translation of verse 3.10.9:**

Fatigue have I none, having attained my Lord beatific,  
Of knowledge pure and form resplendent, with tuḷaci garland bedecked,  
Who, by His wondrous prowess, assumes any form He likes and performs  
Many a wondrous deed and inside His stomach contains all at once  
(During deluge) Nakkapirāṉ (Śiva), Ayaṉ (Brahmā) and all other things and beings.

**Note**

It is only the Omnipotent Lord who can achieve the seemingly impossible and blend into harmony the incompatibles, such as floating on a tender fig-leaf over the vast watery expanse as a mere babe, holding in its stomach all the world with their variegated contents, all things and beings. Singing the glory of the great Sustainer, the Āḻvār is naturally free from fatigues.




## 3.10.10
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

தளர்வு இன்றியே என்றும் எங்கும் பரந்த தனிமுதல் ஞானம் ஒன்றாய்,  
அளவு உடை ஐம்புலன்கள் அறியாவகையால் அருவு ஆகி நிற்கும்,  
வளர் ஒளி ஈசனை மூர்த்தியை பூதங்கள் ஐந்தை இருசுடரை,  
கிளர் ஒளி மாயனை கண்ணனைத் தாள்பற்றி யான் என்றும் கேடு இலனே.

taḷarvu iṉṟiyē eṉṟum eṅkum paranta taṉimutal ñāṉam oṉṟāy,  
aḷavu uṭai aimpulaṉkaḷ aṟiyāvakaiyāl aruvu āki niṟkum,  
vaḷar oḷi īcaṉai mūrttiyai pūtaṅkaḷ aintai irucuṭarai,  
kiḷar oḷi māyaṉai kaṇṇaṉait tāḷpaṟṟi yāṉ eṉṟum kēṭu ilaṉē.

**English translation of verse 3.10.10:**

Never can any harm alight on me, adoring the feet  
Of Kaṇṇaṉ, my wondrous Lord of form exquisite,  
With radiance ever-expanding, who permeates at all times,  
All things, with no effort, of knowledge supreme,  
Controller of the elements five, whom the senses five can’t comprehend.

**Note**

The Lord is everywhere, permeating effortlessly everyone and everything, at all times and yet, He is not tainted by them nor can He, in His universal Form, be comprehended by the five senses, Far from being tainted by the persons and things wherein He stays. His resplendence goes up all the time and His exclusive, auspicious Form (Divya maṅgala vigraha) is of matchless grace and beauty; Adoring Him of such great prowess, the Āḻvār is naturally well beyond the mischief of harm of any kind.




## 3.10.11
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கேடு இல் விழுப் புகழ்க் கேசவனை குருகூர்ச் சடகோபன் சொன்ன,

**English translation of verse 3.10.11:**

Those that can recite these songs ten,  
Out of the ṭhousand composed by kurukūr Caṭakōpaṉ  
In adoration of Kēcavaṉ of undying fame.  
Will in His service be enlisted and granted by Him  
Heavenly bliss, well in sight of the men of this world,  
And made the sole *monarchs* of all His worlds.

**Note**

Those that can recite these ten stanzas will be blessed by the Lord, right here, with spiritual fervour of universal fame and, on their ascent to Heaven, He would invite them to rule over it.




## Retrospective Summary
(3-1): *In the opening decad oj this Centum*, the Āḻvār, who had expounded the glory of mount Māliruñcōḷai in the immediately preceding decad (11-10), drinks deep of the nectarean charm and enthralling beauty of Lord Aḻakar (The Beautiful), enshrined there;

(3-2): *In the second decad*, we note the Āḻvār’s mental agony due to his inability to enjoy the Lord in His Iconic Form *in toto* and give the fullest expression to such enjoyment. God is limitless and to enjoy His boundless beatific vision in full, would be attempting the impossible, namely, limiting the limitless. The Āḻvār is, however, invited by the Lord to enjoy Hit Iconic Form at Tiruvēṅkaṭam to his heart’s content;

(3-3): *In the third decad*, the Āḻvār seeks to render blemishless service unto the Lord at lovely Tiruvēṅkaṭam in ever so many ways, without break, even as a person, feeling the pinch of hunger and with food packet in hand sets the table, as soon as he comes across a suitable spot with plenty of shade and water;

(3-4): Profoundly impressed by the intensity of the Āḻvār’s yearning for Divine Service, the Lord threw into focus His unique faculty of omnipresence, pervading all things, all over and at all times. It is the Lord’s immanence, the astounding phenomenon in front of him, that the Āḻvār attempts to sing *in the fourth decad*, with bewildering amazement;

(3-5): *In the fifth decad*, the Āḻvār extols the kindred souls, thrown into a state of ecstasy, enraptured by the contemplation of the Lord’s wondrous deeds and auspicious traits, moving about singing and dancing, and condemns unreservedly those that remain callously indifferent, unmoved by and impervious to the Lord’s glory;

(3-6): Expounding the Lord’s extreme ‘Saulabhya’ (easy-accessibility) in His Iconic manifestation, the Āḻvār exhorts, *in the sixth decad*, the fellowbeings out of deep compassion and love to worship the Lord in His Iconic Form and make good their lives;

(3-7): The Āḻvār’s advice, as in the sixth decad, having once again fallen on deaf ears, he drowns his disappointment, *in the seventh decad*, in the blissful contemplation of service unto the Lord’s devotees, the logical culmination of service unto the Lord, declaring that he is the vassal of those that stand last in the chain of the Lord’s devotees, sure and steadfast, who are enthralled by the bewitching beauty of the Lord holding the charming discus in hand;

(3-8): *In the eighth decad*, one witnesses a very extraordinary state of affairs, each one of the Āḻvār’s senses yearning for the delight experienced by the other senses; in its competitive exuberance to enjoy the Lord, each faculty aspires to transcend its functional limitations. Thus the hands would want to praise the Lord, the ears would long to drink deep of the nectarean charm of the Lord, the eyes would like to offer Him fruits and flowers, so on and so forth;

(3-9): *The ninth decad* contains the Āḻvār’s exhortation to the poets of the world not to debase their rare poetic talents by eulogising the frail humans for the sake of petty gains, flimsy and fleeting, or the minordeities, but to elevate themselves to their legitimate stature as the Lord’s bards, soaring high, singing exclusively the Supreme Lord’s great glory in beautiful metrical compositions;

(3-10): Once again, the worldlings would not listen to the Āḻvār’s advice as in the ninth decad and yet, it was no mean consolation for him that he could at least get back from them unscathed, without being contaminated by them. *In the concluding decad of this Centum*, the Āḻvār gives expression to the various benefits accrued to him through his total absorption in the Lord, namely, full and complete freedom from (1) want, (2) obstruction in the enjoyment of the Lord, (3) trouble, (4) Sorrow, (5) affliction, (6) fatigue etc.
