## 00 Intro6.2
In this decad, the Āḻvār strikes an entirely new note, making a bold departure, rather, in refreshing contrast to the earlier ones. The Saint, who was hitherto pining for the Lord’s presence and crying out his heart, now keeps Him at bay, when He eventually turns up in post-haste (even as He rushed to Gajendra’s aid) in response to the Nāyakī’s piteous appeal in the last decad, conveyed to the Lord through her special emissaries. The Nāyakī resents the Lord’s delayed appearance and arraigns Him for having strayed elsewhere, making love to the damsels of His special preference and He is being asked to go back to them. The door is shut against Him, a movement in the contrary direction indeed! But there is nothing uncommon about this, as this is a natural ingredient of convivial love, which is super-sensitive to, and extremely intolerant of the lapses on the part of either partner, the overzealous female, in particular, being critical of the remotest risk of alienation of the male from her, by his getting under the spell of any other lady-the characteristic feminine jealousy, keen and cruel. Actually, the Nāyakī’s pangs of separation even egged her on to the extreme step of putting an end to her life, rather than eking out a miserable existence.

Of the nine kinds of relationship subsisting between the Lord (Super Soul) and the Individual Soul, as set out in the Śloka “Pitā ca rakṣakaḥ Śeṣī, Bharthā Jñeyo Ramāpatiḥ.....” the husbandwife relationship is attracted here. The strained relationship such as the one exhibited in this decad, did subsist, as a temporary phase, between Lord Kṛṣṇa and the Gopīs. The Nāyakī would now seem to have got into the mood of the Gopīs. Similar treatment is noticeable in Kulaśekara Āḻvār’s Perumāḷ Tirumoḻi (of Ērmalar Pūṅkuḻal) and Tirumaṅkai Āḻvār’s Periya Tirumoḻi (Kāṭil Kaṭippiṭṭu).




## 6.2.1
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மின்இடை மடவார்கள் நின்அருள் சூடுவார் முன்பு நான் அது அஞ்சுவன்  
மன்உடை இலங்கை அரண் காய்ந்த மாயவனே

**English translation of verse 6.2.1:**

I am afraid, You and I, the thin-waisted favourites of Yours  
Will scold, all Your mischief do I know, yet it no longer matters.  
The ramparts of Rāvaṇa’s Laṅkā, You pulled down in anger great,  
You, perfect One of wondrous deeds, from here You better depart  
And go anywhere You like but leave my playthings here, all right.

### Notes

\(i\) Reference to playthings, in this song, would make it appear that Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī and the Lord were playing some game and the latter suddenly left. The Nāyakī felt piqued by this sudden departure of the game-partner so that, when He presented Himself later on, she would keep mum. And now, the Lord tried to coax her, in ever so many ways: He lavished epithets on her describing her as a thin-waisted beauty and so on. Even then, she would not respond and the frustrated Lover got hold of the games-materials lying on the ground (Ball etc.) and addressed them amorously. Well, the farthest limit of provocation had been reached and the Nāyakī could no longer resist coming out of her shell. She rebuked the Lord, saying that she was not the thin-waisted beauty referred to by Him and He would do well to go back to those beauties with whom He had been indulging prior to coming down to her. She also cautioned Him that, in case those ladies got to know of His having come over to her, they would scold both Him and her. But then, she was severing her connections with Him and the displeasure of those other ladies was, therefore, of no consequence to her. As the Lord was about to leave the place, picking in hand the games-materials, the Nāyakī sternly asked Him to leave her playthings and go. It may be recapitulated that, in the preamble to this decad, the Nāyakī was stated to be in a desperate mood, ready even to put an end to her life. What else is it but (spiritual) death when she spells out anything as hers, in His presence? That Savant Ciṟiyāttāṉ would point out that the notion of ‘mine’ and ‘not mine’ reigned supreme in Dhṛtarāṣṭra’s mind and this eventually led to the destruction of his race. Right at the commencement of Bhagavad Gitā, he asked Sañjaya: Say, Sañjaya, say what wrought *my people* (māmakā) and the Pāṇḍavas”.

\(ii\) The Lord’s destruction of Rāvaṇa’s Laṅkā is also taken by the Nāyakī with a pinch of salt. She sees in it an attempt on His part to draw into His broad net, the numbers of the weaker sex, by making it appear that He did so much, ate no food, spent sleepless days and nights, bunded the ocean, fought a pitched battle with the formidable Rāvaṇa and destroyed his citadel, all for the sake of a woman. The Nāyakī spitefully declares that she could very well see through His game.

**Tamil text and transliteration:**

போகு நம்பீ உன் தாமரைபுரை கண் இணையும் செவ்வாய் முறுவலும்  
ஆகுலங்கள் செய்ய அழிதற்கே நோற்றோமேயாம்?  
தோகை மாமயிலார்கள் நின் அருள் சூடுவார் செவி ஓசை வைத்து எழ  
ஆகள் போகவிட்டு குழல் ஊது போயிருந்தே.

pōku nampī uṉ tāmaraipurai kaṇ iṇaiyum cevvāy muṟuvalum

**English translation of verse 6.2.2:**

Get thee gone, oh. Sire; we womenfolk seem born to dwindle  
Under the spell of Your lotus eyes and bewitching smiles  
On Your red lips, better go and graze the cows,  
Playing the flute from behind unto the recipients of Your love  
Having locks lovely like the spread-out plumes of the peacock.

### Note

When asked by the Nāyakī to get away, the Lord entered into an argument with her, saying that she could not claim ownership of the games materials and that apart, it would be most uncharitable on her part to expel Him who had come over to her, out of deep love. The Lover advanced towards the Nāyakī with bewitching smile and sweet glances but the Nāyakī, still smarting under a sense of deliberate neglect by the Lover, observed that His smiles and glances actually sapped her and other women, unfortunate like her, rather than sustain and bade Him to keep grazing the cows and playing the flute for the delectation of the lucky damsels of Gokula, the recipients of His favours, with lovely locks. The description of the lovely locks of the Lover’s favourites given here, initially came from His lips, complimenting the Nāyakī but she would not acknowledge it and she spitefully turned it on to those other ladies, basking in the sunshine of His love.




## 6.2.3
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

போயிருந்து நின் புள்ளுவம் அறியாதவர்க்கு உரை நம்பீ! நின்செய்ய-  
வாய் இருங் கனியும் கண்களும் விபரீதம் இந் நாள்  
வேய் இரும் தடம் தோளினார் இத்திருவருள் பெறுவார்எவர் கொல்  
மா இரும் கடலைக் கடைந்த பெருமானாலே?

pōyiruntu niṉ puḷḷuvam aṟiyātavarkku urai nampī! niṉceyya-  
vāy iruṅ kaṉiyum kaṇkaḷum viparītam in nāḷ  
vēy irum taṭam tōḷiṉār ittiruvaruḷ peṟuvārevar kol

**English translation of verse 6.2.3:**

Oh, Sire, better keep off from us and try Your viles  
On girls unwary; indeed Your red fruit-like lips and eyes  
Are more charming than ever before; I know not who are those,  
With bamboo-like shoulders fine that shall be blest  
To enjoy this great Churner of the ocean, deep and vast.

### Note

The Lord who was asked to go and fend the cows and play the flute, as in the last song, affirmed that He could play the flute and give vent to His love all right, only in the company of His beloved ones, of which the Nāyakī was indeed the crown jewel. But the Nāyakī was adamant and retorted that she would not be led away by His guiles any more and that He would rather play His pranks on unwary customers elsewhere and get on with them. The Lord appealed to her once again, asking her to behold His eagerness to taste the bliss of kissing her lips and gazing at her charming figure. Lo! she found His lips and eyes even more charming than ever before. Overpowered that she was by the Lord’s exquisite charm, she couldn’t help giving expression to it, even in the midst of her feminine rancour. She thought within herself, who those blessed damsels would be, that shall have the most enviable rapport with the charming Lord, like unto the Divine Mother who got at Him through the churning of the Milky ocean.




## 6.2.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஆலின் நீள் இலை ஏழ் உலகும் உண்டு அன்று நீ கிடந்தாய் உன் மாயங்கள்-  
மேலை வானவரும் அறியார் இனி எம் பரமே?  
வேலின் நேர் தடம் கண்ணினார் விளையாடு சூழலைச் சூழவே நின்று  
காலி மேய்க்க வல்லாய்! எம்மை நீ கழறேலே.

āliṉ nīḷ ilai ēḻ ulakum uṇṭu aṉṟu nī kiṭantāy uṉ māyaṅkaḷ-  
mēlai vāṉavarum aṟiyār iṉi em paramē?  
vēliṉ nēr taṭam kaṇṇiṉār viḷaiyāṭu cūḻalaic cūḻavē niṉṟu  
kāli mēykka vallāy! emmai nī kaḻaṟēlē.

**English translation of verse 6.2.4:**

Aren’t You the One who once reposed on a fig-leaf tender,  
Holding all the worlds in Your stomach? Your wondrous deeds.  
How can we know when even the Celestials can’t comprehend?  
Oh, Lord, tending cows near about damsels with eyes like [spear,][?]  
Don’t tantalise us with white lies any more.

### Note

The Lord refuted the Nāyakī’s allegation of hollowness and insincerity and put it back on her and her mates, saying that He was absolutely forthright and straightforward and it was only they that were full of viles. The Nāyakī was, however, quick to point out the incompatibility of His reposing on a tender fig-leaf afloat, holding, as a tender babe, all the worlds inside His tummy and added that His mysterious deeds baffled even the exalted Celestials. The Lord then explained, rather apologetically, that He got detained by His Mother, who had asked Him to grace the cows, giving Him the stick and that the Nāyakī should not frown at Him to such an extent for this delay, beyond His control. The Nāyakī was, however, in no mood to swallow this fabrication and scorned that, in the name of grazing the cows, He would have been after girls of His special preference. The bubble having been pricked, the Lord kept on shilly-shallying. The Nāyakī cut Him short, saying that He need not tarry any longer and tantalise her with all lies and that He would rather ply His trade with those damsels with fine bamboolike shoulders, with whom all His pretensions might pass muster.




## 6.2.5
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கழறேல் நம்பீ! உன் கைதவம் மண்ணும் விண்ணும் நன்கு அறியும் திண் சக்கர-  
நிழறு தொல் படையாய்! உனக்கு ஒன்று உணர்த்துவன் நான்  
மழறு தேன் மொழியார்கள் நின் அருள் சூடுவார் மனம் வாடி நிற்க எம்-  
குழறு பூவையொடும் கிளியோடும் குழகேலே.

kuḻaṟu pūvaiyoṭum kiḷiyōṭum kuḻakēlē.

**English translation of verse 6.2.5:**

Oh, Sire, address not unto us such shallow words,  
Your viles are well-known, in all the worlds,  
You, wielder of the ancient discus, mighty and mobile!  
Let me make You realise that desist You shall  
From playing with the warbling Pūvai and parrots over here Lest  
You should the minds of Your sweet-tongued favourites injure.

### Note

The Lord suggests that they should seek arbitration to prove that He is the damned liar, they are dubbing Him to be. The Nāyakī, however, rules out the necessity for such a course for His stratagems are too well known, both on Earth and in Heaven. Did He not take advantage of the screen raised by the smoke from the incense burnt by the denizens in Heaven just after His sacramental bath and come down here as Kṛṣṇa and go back to the celestium, a hundred years after, by which time the smoke subsided? The Lord’s holy attendants in Heaven were not aware of His departure during the interval. Again, all that He did as Śrī Kṛṣṇa is history indeed! And yet, the Lord insists that a wise and impartial witness should be called upon to sit in judgement. The Nāyakī rejoins that there is no dearth of witnesses and, for the matter of that, the discus in His hand is enough to knock the bottom of His case. Did He not once say that He would not take up arms in the battle of Mahābhārata and eventually go back on His plighted word? Cornered thus, the Lord kept silent, hanging His head down. Thereupon, the Nāyakī advised Him to listen to her, in case He was keen on finding a way out of this impasse. The Omniscient Lord was being advised and yet, He took it all in good parts and started praising the Nāyakī’s speech as honey and so on. The Nāyakī took exception to this and she and her mates withdrew after making the sarcastic observation that the sweet-tongued damsels in His good books, were elsewhere. Even then, the Lord wouldn’t leave the place and started caressing the Pūvai, the little warbler, and the parrots there. Seeing this from a distance, the Nāyakī warned that He would certainly prejudice those other ladies, the lucky recipients of His grace, by going over here and, on the top of that, fondling the birds living at this end. The Nāyakī, therefore, advised Him to hasten to those ladies.




## 6.2.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

குழகி எங்கள் குழமணன்கொண்டு கோயின்மை செய்து கன்மம் ஒன்று இல்லை  
பழகி யாம் இருப்போம் பரமே இத் திரு அருள்கள்?  
அழகியார் இவ் உலகம் மூன்றுக்கும் தேவிமை ஈதகுவார் பலர் உளர்  
கழகம் ஏறேல் நம்பீ! உனக்கும் இளைதே கன்மமே.

paḻaki yām iruppōm paramē it tiru aruḷkaḷ?  
aḻakiyār iv ulakam mūṉṟukkum tēvimai ītakuvār palar uḷar  
kaḻakam ēṟēl nampī! uṉakkum iḷaitē kaṉmamē.

**English translation of verse 6.2.6:**

Oh, Sire, ‘tis no use Your riding rough-shod, fondling our dolls,  
What You are, long association with you has shown us well,  
Targets we aren’t for Your amorous advances, others there are indeed,  
Fit to be Your consorts, of beauty surpassing in all the worlds;  
Force You shall not into our group, verily Your deeds  
Will put even You to shame and make You hang Your head.

### Note

Sensing the pulse of the Nāyakī, even the birds flew off' and now, only the dolls remain on the scene. The Lord starts fondling the dolls but the Nāyakī prods Him, saying that all this behaviour will not help Him. The Lord, however, swears that He is hers, contemplating her all the time. This draws forth a sharp rebuff from the Nayaki that she has known enough of Him and His white lies, coming off in an unbroken succession, with perfect ease. This again gives a handle to the Lord who remarks that, being used to His pranks so well, they would sorely miss them all, if He went away. So saying, He stays on hob-nobbing, much to the chagrin of the Nāyakī who burst out that all His silly pranks were more than she could endure and that He would do well to turn His attention on those other favourites of His, of matchless beauty. She further warns Him not to force Himself any more into their group. But even this curt warning would not deter Him and He lingers on, knowing as He does, in His heart of hearts, that although the Nāyakī’s longue utters such harsh words, inwardly she would want Him to stay on and bandy words like these, with her. And the Nāyaki frowns at Him, saying that He would fall low in His own estimation, if only He cared to examine the propriety of His conduct-literally, a re-enactment of the ‘Kṛṣṇa-Gopīs episode’.

Śrī Parāśara Bhaṭṭar would exclaim:

“Oh, what an amazing simplicity! the Lord of the Universe, the repository of all auspicious traits, the Supreme Controller of all, is feeling helpless before a handfull of shepherdesses, unable to move either way, neither go inside nor get out of the place. How strange it is that sages Vyāsa and Parāśara could not dwell on this astounding aspect of the Lord! Well, who else but these Āḻvār Saints, soaked in God-love, could comprehend and handle this theme which passeth all understanding of the common man who can’t readily bring himself to believe that the Supreme Lord could ever condescend to reduce Himself to such a strange pass?”




## 6.2.7
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கன்மம் அன்று எங்கள் கையில் பாவை பறிப்பது கடல் ஞாலம் உண்டிட்ட  
நின்மலா! நெடியாய்! உனக்கேலும் பிழை பிழையே  
வன்மமே சொல்லி எம்மை நீ விளையாடுதி அது கேட்கில் என் ஐம்மார்  
தன்ம பாவம் என்னார் ஒரு நான்று தடி பிணக்கே.

taṉma pāvam eṉṉār oru nāṉṟu taṭi piṇakkē.

**English translation of verse 6.2.7:**

Oh, immaculate Lord, you once gulped down the worlds seabound,  
It hardly befits You, oh, great One, to squeeze from our hands  
Our playthings; a mistake is a mistake even if by You committed,  
Words you whisper, we dare not repeat and with us you flirt;  
Surely, our brethren, when they get to know, will feel hurt,  
For good or bad they wouldn’t care and You they might hit.

### Notes

\(i\) Finding the Gopīs terribly vexed with Him, Śrī Kṛṣṇa bade good-bye to them, wishing them well and told them that He would, however, be taking with Him, His playthings. But the Gopīs lost no time in picking up those pieces, with a view to detaining Him and prolonging the controversy. This gave Śrī Kṛṣṇa the golden opportunity He was looking for, to come in physical contact with the Gopīs and snatch the materials from their hands. The Gopīs screamed that this was not the kind of job, expected of Him, to which He replied that this was too petty a job for Him Who had gulped down all the worlds. While conceding His great ability, the Gopīs pointed out that, however big He might be, mistakes committed by Him cannot be overlooked. Śrī Kṛṣṇa tried, in vain, to refute this by saying that He was immaculate and, therefore, above mistakes. At this stage, the Lord pretended to be non-plussed and whispered quite a few secrets into the ears of the Gopīs and they administered a stern warning that He would be belaboured by their brothers without any hesitation, if they got to know about His silly behaviour and the stupid things He spoke to them (Gopīs).

\(ii\) The secrets whispered into the ears of the Gopīs by the Lord, referred to in (i) above, should, in the particular context of Saint Nammāḻvār re-enacting the cld scene of the days gone-by, be taken as *God's secrets with His Saints*. While [Em ār] [Empār?] was discoursing on this song, a few disciples asked him, “What are the secrets, Sire, which the Lord spoke to the Saint?” He replied: “When the Saint, illumined by God, has himself pronounced them as secret, how can you expect me to spell them out?’




## 6.2.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

பிணக்கி யாவையும் யாவரும் பிழையாமல் பேதித்தும் பேதியாதது ஓர்  
கணக்கு இல் கீர்த்தி வெள்ளக் கதிர் ஞான மூர்த்தியினாய்,  
இணக்கி எம்மை எம் தோழிமார் விளையாடப் போதுமின் என்னப் போந்தோமை

uṇakki nī vaḷaittāl eṉ collār ukavātavarē?

**English translation of verse 6.2.8:**

Oh, Sire. You are the embodiment of all that knowledge radiant,  
You keep without name and form all things sentient and non-sentient  
At the time of dissolution and at creation You do sort them out  
And put the species back in their spheres, clear and cogent;  
(We knew not You’d be here) our mates brought us for play,  
If You hugged us close, what would the unfriendly say?

### Note

When the Gopīs threatened to get Śrī Kṛṣṇa beaten, He took up the challenge and shouted at them. The Gopīs coolly told Him, they had known all about Him and there was no need for Him to make all that fuss. When called upon by Him to cite what exactly they had known about Him, they stated, as in the first four lines of this stanza. Śrī Kṛṣṇa then questioned them how, despite all that knowledge they dared to get Him belaboured and elicited the reply that one so great, should not meddle with those frail little girls who had come there to play, not knowing that He would also be there. There was a vast gulf of difference between His play and theirs. His was the creation, sustentation and dissolution of the Sportive Universe (Līlā Vibhūti) whereas they were engaged in simple games, with balls and dolls. Śrī Kṛṣṇa was asked to go His own way, leaving them alone, free to go on with their play. So saying, the Gopīs were about to withdraw themselves but Śrī Kṛṣṇa intercepted them and would not allow them to retreat. The Gopīs remonstrated that, if He encircled and hugged them, personally they had nothing to say, but it was likely to be criticised by the unfriendly spectators around, not aware of the intimate, indissoluble bond that subsists between the individual souls and the Super-Soul. It is here, the Gopīs gave out their real mind, hitherto concealed by their rough exterior.




## 6.2.9
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

உகவையால் நெஞ்சம் உள் உருகி உன் தாமரைத் தடம் கண் விழிகளின்  
அக வலைப் படுப்பான் அழித்தாய் உன் திருவடியால்  
தகவு செய்திலை எங்கள் சிற்றிலும் யாம் அடு சிறு சோறும் கண்டு நின்-  
முக ஒளி திகழ முறுவல் செய்து நின்றிலையே.

muka oḷi tikaḻa muṟuval ceytu niṉṟilaiyē.

**English translation of verse 6.2.9:**

Smile You could and watch with Your face bright,  
The castles we built in our play and the food we cooked.  
But You kicked them all, You have indeed no heart.  
Just to trap us into the sweet looks  
From Your large, lotus eyes, with our hearts melting down.

### Note

In spite of His intercepting the Gopīs, they went their own way, playing games like building houses and cooking food. Śrī Kṛṣṇa, literally pining for their sweet glances, albeit by way of quarrelling with Him, kicked all those things out. Knowing His mind quite well, the Gopīs looked at Him squarely and addressed Him, as above. The inner (esoteric) meaning of this is:

Those engaged in God-love quite often undergo the pangs of separation, when He does not oblige them with His sweet presence and the communion gets snapped. To avoid this painful contingency, these very people switch on to worldly affairs. But the Lord would not give them up and His lovely feet drag them back into His fold, kicking out their erstwhile aberration, the tendency to drift away from Him.




## 6.2.10
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நின்று இலங்கு முடியினாய்! இருபத்தோர் கால் அரசு களைகட்ட  
வென்றி நீள்மழுவா! வியன் ஞாலம் முன் படைத்தாய்!  
இன்று இவ் ஆயர் குலத்தை வீடு உய்யத் தோன்றிய கருமாணிக்கச் சுடர்  
நின்தன்னால் நலிவே படுவோம் என்றும் ஆய்ச்சியோமே.

niṉṟu ilaṅku muṭiyiṉāy! irupattōr kāl aracu kaḷaikaṭṭa

niṉtaṉṉāl nalivē paṭuvōm eṉṟum āycciyōmē.

**English translation of verse 6.2.10:**

Oh, Sire of sapphire hue. You sport the crown grand  
With Your axe triumphant You did root out the kings  
For generations, the vast Universe You created once,  
And now You are here to redeem this shepherd clan,  
But we shepherdesses are by You tormented for ever.

### Note

The rancour of the overzealous Gopīs would obviously not last long, as it is but a temporary phase, an interim facet of connubial relationship, culminating in the reunion of the lover and the beloveds. Śrī Kṛṣṇa didn’t merely kick the houses etc, put up by the Gopīs during play, but kicked their rancour out and made them gaze at His exquisite Form, from the lotus feet upwards, right up to His crown. It is only the Victor that wears the crown and by mentioning the grandeur of His crown, the Gopis mean to acknowledge Him as the Victor, in their erstwhile squabble. Even as He created the worlds, with all their contents, from the melting pot to which they had been consigned earlier, He has infused fresh life into the Gopīs who had earlier been the victims of devastating feminine jealousy. For Him, who as Paraśurāma, destroyed the haughty Kṣatriya kings, extending over twenty-one generations, is it at all much of a job to get the better of the frail Gopīs? Of course, the Gopīs know, that rejoining their Lord now doesn’t mean perpetual enjoyment of His company and they are in for further spells of misery, due to separation from Him. Even so, they are prepared to brave it and get back to Him at least for the time-being.




## 6.2.11
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

**English translation of verse 6.2.11:**

Those that chant tunefully these songs ten  
Out of the thousand Tamil songs of Caṭakōpaṉ  
Of Kurukūr, adoring the Lord, Who (as child Kṛṣṇa) cried bitter  
When someone complained, in general, about the theft of butter,  
Unto His mother, will never from poverty (of God-love) suffer.

**Notes:**

\(i\) Here is a splendid reference to one of the many infant sports of the Lord. The shepherdesses of Bṛndāvaṉ complained to Yaśodha that all their butter had been stolen by some one. Just on hearing this g neral complaint without any mention about Him in particular, child Kṛṣṇa cried immediately, as if to plead that He was not the culprit. Thus, by His own unbidden cry, He betrayed Himself as the urchin thief. An interesting parallel for this is cited in Īṭu commentary. One day, the residents of a mutt (Monastery) asked among themselves as to who should clean and water the monastery and it was decided that the unlearned (uninitiated in the Vedas) among them should be detailed for such menial service. One among them immediately cried (although nobody had spotted him out, as the unlearned): “Sirs, how can I clean such a big place as this?” Poor fellow, he betrayed himself by this spontaneous cry, unnamed and unsought.
