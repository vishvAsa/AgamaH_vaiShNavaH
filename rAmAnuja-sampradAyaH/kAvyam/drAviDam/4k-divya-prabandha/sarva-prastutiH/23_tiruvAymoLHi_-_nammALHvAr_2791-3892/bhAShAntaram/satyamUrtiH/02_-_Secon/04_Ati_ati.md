## 00 Intro2.4
In the penultimate song of the last decad the Āḻvār expressed his desire to sing profusely the glory of the Lord in a chorus. Looking around, he, however, found the prospect of mustering persons from the rank and file of the worldlings for this purpose pretty bleak. He had, therefore, no option but to shift the venue of his enjoyment to the high Heavens and sing the Lord’s praise in the company of the ‘Nitya Sūrīs’ there. This ardent longing of the Āḻvār was, however, not realised there and then and once again the Āḻvār was thrown into deep dejection assuming the overtones of a frustrated feminine lover in a state of despondency. The Āḻvār had got into such a state on two earlier occasions, namely I-4 and II-1. On the first occasion he sent some birds as his emissaries to the Lord, while, on the second occasion, all things around seemed to suffer, like him, the pangs of separation from the Lord and he, therefore, wept along with those comrades-in-distress. But now his grief is so deep and poignant that all that is said in this decad is put in the mouth of the mother who questions the Lord how He could reduce her love-intoxicated daughter to such a parlous state and asks Him to clarify His intentions as to what exactly He proposes to do about the poor little victim.

No doubt, it is the Āḻvār who sings, and yet, this assumes the form of a mother’s dialogue with the Lord indicating aṅ extremely critical state so far as the Āḻvār is concerned. This is like the swollen river Kāverī or Gangā branching off into rivulets, going by different names but carrying the same water as in Kāvērī or Gangā. The necessity for the mother’s intervention here, in this decad, unlike the two earlier decads referred to above can be understood if we probe into the genesis of each of these three decads. It is a matter of common knowledge that the grief over the loss of a thing varies in direct proportion to the value one attaches to the thing lost. For example, as between the loss of a silver piece and a gold piece, the latter causes a far more grievous feeling of privation. If the same person, later oṇ, lost a necklace set with costly gems and rubies it would be the worst blow. And now let us analyse the cause of the Āḻvār’s grief at the commencement of each of the two earlier decads. In I-3-10 the Āḻvār wanted to adore and embrace the Lord’s pair of feet which spanned the entire Universe during His Avatār as Trivikrama. But he couldn’t get at those feet and, in the grief that ensued, he sent the birds on an errand to the Lord as in I-4. Again, in I-10-9, the Āḻvār devoutly longed for communion with the Lord in His Iconic form in the pilgrim centre,. Tirukkuruṅkuṭi (deep south in Tamiḷ Nādu). Non-materialisation of this ardent desire brought on grief far more intense than on the earlier occasion in view of the relatively greater importance of the thing now lost, namely, communion with the Lord in His Iconic manifestation, a veritable ocean of innumerable excellances vis-a-vis His Incarnate form which is like the river, once in spate, now turned dry or turgid. And now what is the position? In II-3-10 the Āḻvār pined for entry into the gatherings of the devotees and singing profusely the glory of the Lord in their steadfast company. But this did not happen immediately, and naturally, the loss is the worst so far on the analogy of the successive loss of silver,. Gold and gem-studded necklace. So great is the importance attached to the company of the Godly. This accounts for the induction of the mother into the scene.

It might be questioned why this decad complains at the door of the Lord instead of being couched as an appeal to the band of the devotees on the Yonder side, whose company the Āḻvār pines for but could not have. Well, the complaint was always lodged with the King, the aggrieved party rushing to the Palace gate even though the gems and rubies were looted by robbers in the jungle. As a matter of fact it is only the Lord who grants us all felicities including participation in the gatherings of the Godly and hence, the appeal at His door.




## 2.4.1
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஆடி ஆடி அகம் கரைந்து, இசை  
பாடிப் பாடிக் கண்ணீர் மல்கி, எங்கும்  
நாடி நாடி நரசிங்கா என்று,  
வாடி வாடும் இவ் வாள் நுதலே.

āṭi āṭi akam karaintu, icai  
pāṭip pāṭik kaṇṇīr malki, eṅkum  
nāṭi nāṭi naraciṅkā eṉṟu,  
vāṭi vāṭum iv vāḷ nutalē.

**English translation of verse 2.4.1:**

This young dame of forehead bright,  
Keeps rattling, with a mind worn out;  
Looking out all over she sings and sings.  
Cries out, “Oh, Naraciṅkā!” and sinks.

**Notes**

\(i\) The mother exclaims:

> “Alas! my daughter feels let down by the Lord who, as Narasiṃha
> (Man-Lion), came to Prahlāda’s aid. Restive and rattling, she looks
> out for Him everywhere, her heart melts down in contemplation of the
> Lord and she cries out for Him in melodious notes expressive of her
> melancholy”.

\(ii\) The tears flowing down the cheeks of Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī in torrents remind us of Hamunān’s query to Sītā, the Divine Mother in captivity, why tears were rolling down her cheeks.

\(iii\) Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī is looking out here, there and everywhere for the Lord who, she is sure, will never fail to succour His devotees. As Narasiṅkā He had studiously stationed Himself in every nook and comer, pillar and particle. While discoursing on this song, Śri Parāśara Bhaṭṭar said:

> “Parāṇkuśa Nāyakī is looking for the Lord even in the folds of her
> sari.”.

Had He not once got on to the hip of the Āḻvār in the course of His ascent to the Āḻvār’s head? (1-9-4).

\(iv\) Says the gnostic mother: “My daughter is indeed worried, over and over again, whether the Lord would help only Prahḻāda and not her. She has not, however, given up hopes as yet and that is why life is still sticking to her”. Face is the index of the mind and Parāṅkuṣa Nāyakī’s lingering hopes are reflected on her forehead.




## 2.4.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வாள் நுதல் இம் மடவரல், உம்மைக்  
காணும் ஆசையுள் நைகின்றாள், விறல்  
வாணன் ஆயிரம் தோள் துணித்தீர், உம்மைக்  
காண நீர் இரக்கம் இலீரே.

vāḷ nutal im maṭavaral, ummaik  
kāṇum ācaiyuḷ naikiṉṟāḷ, viṟal  
vāṇaṉ āyiram tōḷ tuṇittīr, ummaik  
kāṇa nīr irakkam ilīrē.

**English translation of verse 2.4.2:**

To behold you (of beauty exquisite),  
Who, the thousand arms of mighty vāṇaṉ smote.  
This young lady of forehead bright  
Stands consumed by a burning desire,  
But your grace on her you don’t confer.

**Notes**

\(i\)

> “Oh, Lord Kṛṣṇa, You secured Uṣā, the daughter of the mighty Bāṇāsura
> for Aniruddha, your grandson, after chopping off the Asura’s thousand
> sinewy shoulders. And yet you would not relent in the case of my
> daughter and relieve her distress”.

\(ii\) Reference has again been made to the bright forehead of Parāṅkuṣa Nāyakī oṇly to betray the mother’s surprise at the Lord’s indifference even to one of such fascinating charm.

\(iii\) *Mother to the Lord*:

> “Oh, it is all topsy-turvy my daughter pining for you! It should be
> the other way around. It is indeed the Owner who should be all agog to
> get at his property.”

The Lord retorts saying,

> “Well, your daughter’s desire to get at me may be all right but the
> impediments to the realisation of her desire are heavier still”.

But then, the mother is not prepared to swallow this. She asks Him “For one who smote the thousand arms of the mighty Bāṇāsura, is it at all difficult to cut out these impediments?”




## 2.4.3
**English translation of verse 2.4.3:**

**Tamil text and transliteration:**

இரக்க மனத்தோடு எரி அணை,  
அரக்கும் மெழுகும் ஒக்கும் இவள்,  
இரக்கம் எழீர் இதற்கு என் செய்கேன்,  
அரக்கன் இலங்கை செற்றீருக்கே.

irakka maṉattōṭu eri aṇai,  
arakkum meḻukum okkum ivaḷ,  
irakkam eḻīr itaṟku eṉ ceykēṉ,  
arakkaṉ ilaṅkai ceṟṟīrukkē.

**English translation of verse 2.4.3:**

You, who the demon’s Laṅkā did rout,  
Relent not for this dame of tender heart,  
Who is like unto wax set on fire;  
Oh, what can I do for her?

**Note**

[Mother to the Lord:]

> “What you did to reclaim Sītā from her captivity in Laṅkā, how you
> languished without food and sleep days on end, how you bunded the
> roaring sea and routed Rāvaṇa’s Laṅkā, lock, stock and barrel have
> been chronicled by sage Vālmīki in his immortal Rāmāyaṇa. And so it is
> well within the Knowledge of my hapless daughter. Therefore it is she
> feels tormented why she couldn’t get a similar treatment at your
> hands. Oh, what a contrasting picture! my daughter of melting
> tenderness of heart, like the wax come in contact with fire, and you,
> absolutely hard-hearted and unrelenting. What can I do, in between?
> There is no remedy for this situation except the influx of your sweet
> grace. I daresay you who did so much for Sītā, will not lay yourself
> open to the charge of cruel partiality and terrible discrimination by
> not coming to my daughter’s aid, at once.”




## 2.4.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

இலங்கை செற்றவனே என்னும், பின்னும்  
வலம் கொள் புள் உயர்த்தாய் என்னும், உள்ளம்  
மலங்க வெவ் உயிர்க்கும், கண்ணீர் மிகக்  
கலங்கிக் கைதொழும் நின்று இவளே

ilaṅkai ceṟṟavaṉē eṉṉum, piṉṉum  
valam koḷ puḷ uyarttāy eṉṉum, uḷḷam  
malaṅka vev uyirkkum, kaṇṇīr mikak  
kalaṅkik kaitoḻum niṉṟu ivaḷē

**English translation of verse 2.4.4:**

Says unto you my daughter, oh, Lord,  
“Laṅkā, (for Sītā’s sake) you destroyed  
And on your banner is the mighty bird (Garuḍa)”;  
With a mind agitated and breathing hot,  
Tears well up her eyes and badly upset, And stunned she stands, with joined palms.

**Notes**

\(i\) [Mother to the Lord:]

> “I thought I had consoled my daughter saying that she should sustain
> herself meditating on your meritorious deeds as Śrī Rāma with the firm
> belief that you will, some day, succour her as you did Sītā. Even Sītā
> had to wait for quite some length of time before she was reclaimed
> from her captivity in Laṅkā. But suddenly my daughter has started
> crying as before. But then, She says that you were pining for Sītā all
> the time, but you just can’t remember this poor girl. It is not as if
> you lack the means of locomotion if only you wished to come and meet
> my daughter. She is well aware that the mighty Garuḍa, moving at
> supersonic speed, is always at your disposal. And so she concludes it
> is sheer indifference on your part. On the other hand she is very much
> agitated and bursting with tears. Nevertheless, with joined palms she
> is worshipping You. I just don’t know what to do”.

\(ii\) It is worth noting that, whatever be the mood and mode of speech of the Āḻvār, be he calm or agitated, his basic stance as the Lord’s sole servitor (Śeṣatva) remains quite *in tact*; in other words, his essential nature (svarūpa) does not undergo any modification. That is how reference is made to the Parāṅkuṣa Nāyakī’s worshipping posture even in such an extremely critical state of mental cogitation (see, in this connection, aphorism 119 of ‘Ācārya Hṛdayam’).




## 2.4.5
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

இவள் இராப்பகல் வாய்வெரீ இத், தன  
குவளை ஒண் கண்ண நீர் கொண்டாள், வண்டு  
திவளும் தண் அம் துழாய் கொடீர், என  
தவள வண்ணர் தகவுகளே.

ivaḷ irāppakal vāyverī it, taṉa  
kuvaḷai oṇ kaṇṇa nīr koṇṭāḷ, vaṇṭu  
tivaḷum taṇ am tuḻāy koṭīr, eṉa  
tavaḷa vaṇṇar takavukaḷē.

**English translation of verse 2.4.5:**

Day and night this girl keeps babbling  
And in her flowery eyes tears are swelling;  
You don’t on her bestow your tulacī garland, cool and lovely,  
Swarmed by bees; What has happened, (I can’t see)  
To you of disposition pure and your qualify of mercy.

**Note**

\(i\) [Mother to the Lord:]

> “Well, if you don’t relent even in such a precarious condition of my
> daughter what indeed has happened to your quality of mercy? Has it
> dried up altogether?
>
> My daughter is talking about you all the time whereas it should be the
> other way round. We know from Hanumān’s report to Sītā how you kept
> pining for her, spending sleepless days and rights, thinking and
> talking about her all the time. Oh, what a pity! the eyes of my
> daughter which should shed tears of joy are bursting with sorrow.
> After all, what does she want from you? Nothing more than the cool
> tulacī garland from your person in replacement of the withered one on
> her feverish body, consumed by the pangs of separation from you.
> Actually, she envies the bees gaily swarming your garland studded with
> honey, and even wishes that she had been born as one of those
> fortunate bees”.

\(ii\) Reference has been made by the mother to the Lord’s purity of disposition and quality of mercy in this context rather sneeringly. Śrī Parāśara Bhaṭṭar would put it that the mother means to say,

> “Well, if there were a few persons like you the girls would indeed
> prosper very well!”




## 2.4.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

தகவு உடையவனே என்னும், பின்னும்  
மிக விரும்பும் பிரான் என்னும், எனது  
அக உயிர்க்கு அமுதே என்னும், உள்ளம்  
உக உருகி நின்று உள் உளே.

takavu uṭaiyavaṉē eṉṉum, piṉṉum  
mika virumpum pirāṉ eṉṉum, eṉatu  
aka uyirkku amutē eṉṉum, uḷḷam  
uka uruki niṉṟu uḷ uḷē.

**English translation of verse 2.4.6:**

Says my daughter, with a mind thawing,  
Right from the inner core of her being,  
“Oh, Lord! you are indeed merciful,  
You are my highly coveted Benefactor,  
And to my inner soul, the nectar”.

**Notes**

\(i\) In the preceding stanza the mother complained about a heartless Lord, who had put her daughter in such a parlous predicament. But no sooner had the mother opened her mouth, with such a reproach on her tongue than the daughter (Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī) gagged it effectively, despite her pangs of separation from the Lord, by proclaiming that the Lord is an inexhaustible fountain of grace and a highly coveted Benefactor. To dub Him as devoid of mercy would be just as inconceivable as the ocean getting emptied of all its water.

\(ii\) A close parallel to this can be found in Rāmāyaṇa, Sundara Kārḍa, 26-13 where, even while bemoaning her captivity in Laṅkā, Sītā extolled the great qualities of Śrī Rāma and lamented that one of such excellence had not so far come to her rescue merely because she lacked the requisite felicity, being totally devoid of grace because of the offence thrown by her, once at Rāma and a much greater offence at Lakṣmaṇa later on. This clearly shows that there can be absolutely on flaw or drawback in the Lord warranting His being given up on any account, even in trying moments of separation from Him. As a matter of fact, what is sought to be classified as a drawback in the Lord, if at all, is just the mental agony inflicted by Him on the devotees when He doesn’t favour them with His nectarcan presence. But even this has a purpose behind, forming, as it does, part of the Lord’s technique of shock-treatment whereby the devotee’s appetite for God is whetted.




## 2.4.7
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

உள் உள் ஆவி உலர்ந்து உலர்ந்து, என  
வள்ளலே கண்ணனே என்னும், பின்னும்  
வெள்ள நீர்க் கிடந்தாய் என்னும், என  
கள்விதான் பட்ட வஞ்சனையே.

uḷ uḷ āvi ularntu ularntu, eṉa  
vaḷḷalē kaṇṇaṉē eṉṉum, piṉṉum  
veḷḷa nīrk kiṭantāy eṉṉum, eṉa  
kaḷvitāṉ paṭṭa vañcaṉaiyē.

**English translation of verse 2.4.7:**

Enticed by the Lord is my daughter  
And her inner soul is fully dried  
And yet from me she tries to hide  
And cries out, “Oh, my liberal Lord,  
Kaṇṇā, resting on oceanic waters”.

**Notes**

\(i\) With an aching heart the mother gives expression to her daughter’s enticement by the Lord and her present critical condition. The soul which is inherently incapable of being burnt or dried up, is said to have been dried up in Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī’s case. And yet, she tries to keep her mother off the track and lauds her beloved Lord.

\(ii\) Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī says her Lord is a great Benefactor, a liberal donor and all that, just like a person in deep thirst calling repeatedly, ‘water, water’ or chewing up bits of refined camphor.

\(iii\) In Viṣṇu dharma, one is advised to meditate on Lord Narasiṃha, while moving about in a frightfully dark night, to ward off evils; likewise, one, in dire distress or deep thirst, should think of the Lord reclining in the milky ocean.

\(iv\) Śrī Rāma had exclaimed that he couldn’t be away from Sītā, the dark-eyed, even for a trice.

The Lord’s position vis-a-vis Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī should also be just the same and yet, the mother witnesses things happening in the reverse Order here and she, therefore, calls it a mere treachery.




## 2.4.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வஞ்சனே என்னும் கைதொழும், தன  
நெஞ்சம்வேவ நெடிது உயிர்க்கும், விறல்  
கஞ்சனை வஞ்சனை செய்தீர், உம்மைத்  
தஞ்சம் என்று இவள் பட்டனவே.

vañcaṉē eṉṉum kaitoḻum, taṉa  
neñcamvēva neṭitu uyirkkum, viṟal  
kañcaṉai vañcaṉai ceytīr, ummait  
tañcam eṉṟu ivaḷ paṭṭaṉavē.

**English translation of verse 2.4.8:**

Oh, Slayer of heady Kañcaṉ, here is my daughter  
Who in you refuge sought and is now in great distress;  
The heavy sigh she heaves, her heart blisters;  
And yet, with folded hands she dees your treachery own,  
How You made her your vassal, to her unknown.

**Notes**

\(i\) When the mother complained in the previous song about the treacherous enticement of her daughter by the Lord, Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī could not bear this affront to her beloved Lord. Uttering the same word, ‘treachery’, as the mother did, the Nāyakī gives it a different complexion. The Lord’s treachery lies in the great good He has done her by making her His vassal *unknown to her*.

\(ii\) The daughter’s distress, referred to by the Mother, can be analysed as follows:

> She does not go after food and raiment like the worldlings;  
> Nor does she enjoy the heavenly bliss like the celestials in Heaven;  
> She cannot wait patiently till, one day, the final goal is reached;  
> Nor does the Lord finish her off as He did the heady Kaṃsa, upsetting
> all his nefarious plans.  
> How tantalising, and that too, for one whose sole refuge is the Lord!
> This is the mother’s complaint.




## 2.4.9
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

பட்ட போது எழு போது அறியாள், விரை  
மட்டு அலர் தண் துழாய் என்னும், சுடர்  
வட்ட வாய் நுதி நேமியீர், நுமது  
இட்டம் என்கொல் இவ்ஏழைக்கே.

paṭṭa pōtu eḻu pōtu aṟiyāḷ, virai  
maṭṭu alar taṇ tuḻāy eṉṉum, cuṭar  
vaṭṭa vāy nuti nēmiyīr, numatu  
iṭṭam eṉkol ivēḻaikkē.

**English translation of verse 2.4.9:**

Neither Sun-rise nor Sun-set, my daughter knows  
And yet her mouth utters “tulacī, cool and fragrant. Studded with honey”,  
Oh Sire, holding the discuss effulgent.  
Sharp and round! what indeed do you propose  
To do with this girl who is so innocent?

**Notes**

\(i\) Unlike the worldlings who know day and night too well, earning by day and spending by night those earnings on worldly pleasures, Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī is altogether ignorant of Sun-rise and Sun-set. Does it mean that she is not sentient? She is no doubt sentient as her mouth constantly utters the words ‘tulacī cool and fragrant, studded with honey

\(ii\) When the Lord was indifferent to the above observations of the mother she asked Him;

> “Sire, the effulgent discus in your hand is ever ready to go into
> action, helping your devotees and destroying the evil-doers. What
> precisely do you intend to do with my daughter? Will you get rid of
> her as you did Hiraṇya and his brood?

or

> Will you elevate her to the rank of the celestials on the Yonder
> heaven and enjoy her bewitching beauty, enhanced still further by the
> conch and discus in her hands?

or

> Will you put her back among the worldlings buried in earthly pleasures
> oblivious of their essential nature and their relationship with you?”




## 2.4.10
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஏழை பேதை இராப்பகல், தன  
கேழ் இல் ஒண் கண்ண நீர் கொண்டாள், கிளர்  
வாழ்வை வேவ இலங்கை செற்றீர். இவள்  
மாழை நோக்கு ஒன்றும் வாட்டேன்மினே

**English translation of verse 2.4.10:**

Laṅkā’s spectacular wealth you routed, Oh, Sire,  
This poor girl’s eyes of peerless beauty shed tears  
Day and night; may you keep, at least,  
The youthful looks in her eyes in tact!

**Notes**

[Mother to the Lord:]

> “The tears welling up my daughter’s eyes day and night resemble the

> If she passes away we will lose her. But mind you, you will lose your

## 2.4.11
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வாட்டம் இல் புகழ் வாமனனை இசை  
கூட்டி வண் சடகோபன் சொல், அமை  
பாட்டு ஓர் ஆயிரத்து இப் பத்தால், அடி  
சூட்டலாகும் அம் தாமமே.

vāṭṭam il pukaḻ vāmaṉaṉai icai  
kūṭṭi vaṇ caṭakōpaṉ col, amai  
pāṭṭu ōr āyirattu ip pattāl, aṭi  
cūṭṭalākum am tāmamē.

**English translation of verse 2.4.11:**

Those that recite these songs ten,  
Out of the thousand melodious songs of Caṭakōpaṉ,  
Graciously composed and grammatically clean,  
In adoration of Vāmaṉaṉ of undying renown,  
Will have the fortune great,  
To offer lovely flowers at His feeṭ.

**Notes**

\(i\) Those that recite these ten songs will be endowed with the bliss of rendering perennial service at the feet of the Lord in the company of the ‘Nitya Sūrīs’ in Heaven, the very bliss coveted by the Āḻvār at the end of the last decad, without passing through any of the sufferings undergone by the Āḻvār.

\(ii\) In the first song of this decad reference was made to Parāṅkuṣa Nāyakī withering down. Actually her condition reflects the state of the Lord as well. And now that mention is made of Vāmaṉaṉ of undying fame, it can be inferred that He rose to His full stature by responding to the mother’s call to preserve her daughter’s looks, the very source of His sustenance. And so He is back again face to face with the Saint.

\(iii\) Mention has been made here of Vāmaṉaṉ, in particular, as He Was known to be very keen about the reclamation of His possessions even if it involved His having to seek alms. And now, will He lag behind even after the mother had begged of Him to take particular care of His very source of sustenance?
