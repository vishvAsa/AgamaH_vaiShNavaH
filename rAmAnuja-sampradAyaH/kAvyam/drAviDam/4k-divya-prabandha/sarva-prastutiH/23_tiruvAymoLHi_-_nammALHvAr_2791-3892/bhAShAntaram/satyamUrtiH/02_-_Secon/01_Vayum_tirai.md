## 00 Intro2.1
In the last stanza of the preceding decad, the Āḻvār who had already conjured up the vision of the Lord as having entered his body and gone right up to his head, referred to the Lord as the blue gem, overlord of the Celestials and a very attractive jewel, by himself. Each one of these features of the Lord was so fascinating that the Āḻvār could not resist the immediate urge to enjoy them outwardly. The enjoyment, longed for, did not, however, materialise instantly and the Āḻvār was thrown into a state of deep dejection, reduced to the abject position of a forlorn lover. The Āḻvār, thus transformed into a female lover (Parāṇkuśa Nāyakī), pining for her beloved Lord, moves into a garden on the sea-shore to bemoan her separation. It may be recalled that she was in a similar predicament earlier, when she sent the birds etc, as her emissaries to the Lord-See 1-4. But then, she is worse off now, not finding any one to carry her message to the Lord. The self-same stork which she had commissioned earlier now looms in her eyes as a comrade-in-distress. The stork’s natural complexion is white but the Āḻvār thinks that it is a case of decoloration due to the pangs of separation from the Lord, experienced by it. The Aṉṟil birds of opposite sex always stay together and even during sleep keep their bills locked in each other‘s mouth. The moment the bills get unlocked, they wake up and start crying. Unaware of this natural sequence, Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī thinks that these birds cry out their agony of separation from the Lord, like her. The wind, ever on the move, appears to the Āḻvār to go about frantically in search of the Lord; the clouds, unleashing rain-water, look like shedding tears of grief due to separation from the Lord; likewise, the waning of the Moon, the surging, up and down, of the waves, the burning of the lamp and all other natural phenomena are invested by the love-lorn Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī with her own poignancy and she bemoans their lot as well. This sets the pace and pattern of this decad, pin pointing the Lord’s quality of making his devotees mad with God-love.

Here is an interesting comparison: Lakṣmaṇa, while pleading that he should be allowed to accompany Śrī Rāma into exile, cited the example of the fish failing to survive without water, thereby indicating that Śrī Rāma was unto Lakṣmaṇa what water is unto fish. But here is Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī who feels that the fish, water and all things subsist on the Lord and cannot brook separation from Him! The Āḻvār addresses these Comrades-in-distress commiserating with them in their sad plight. It is worth noting that Śloka 15 and the following few ślokas in the last chapter of the tenth Skanda of Bhāgavatam run in a similar vein.




## 2.1.1
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வாயும் திரை உகளும் கானல் மடநாராய்,  
ஆயும் அமர் உலகும் துஞ்சிலும் நீ துஞ்சாயால்,  
நோயும் பயலைமையும் மீது ஊர எம்மேபோல்,  
நீயும் திருமாலால் நெஞ்சம் கோள்பட்டாயே?

vāyum tirai ukaḷum kāṉal maṭanārāy,  
āyum amar ulakum tuñcilum nī tuñcāyāl,  
nōyum payalaimaiyum mītu ūra emmēpōl,  
nīyum tirumālāl neñcam kōḷpaṭṭāyē?

**English translation of verse 2.1.1:**

Sleep you don‘t, You young stork in the sea-shore garden!  
Though my mother and Heavens too have into slumber gone;  
The whole of your body is white with grief great;  
Like me, have you unto Tirumāl lost your heart?

**Notes**

\(i\) Not falling within the mischief of ‘tamas’ (inertia), there is no question of the Heavens going into slumber. The wonder of it is that even the Heavens, never known to sleep, have gone to sleep, but the poor stork doesn’t sleep! The (gnostic) mother would not sleep because there was a time when she was agitating her mind about finding a suitable match for her highly evolved daughter (Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī), and now again, the mother cannot sleep when the daughter is in such a state of mental agony, separated from her Lord. Even such a mother has gone to sleep but the stork wouldn’t sleep. Surely, its affliction must be very heavy.

\(ii\) The Āḻvār thinks that decoloration has set in throughout the body of the stork like the fast-spreading poison, and that is why it is white all over. About the decoloration of the lover due to the gloom of separation, see notes below 1-4-4.

\(iii\) The soul can neither be split nor burnt, neither wetted nor dried up, and yet the Āḻvār has, in several places, referred to his getting split, burnt, wetted and dried up; the inanimate mind is raised by him to the status of an animate being and he extols it and denounces it alternately, recording to its tempo and behaviour; each sense-organ, each faculty, is made to acquire an independent stature of its own, as if it is a separate animate entity by itself and these compete with each other in the matter of God-enjoyment, exceeding and even transcending their functional limitations (3-8); God-love, engendered in the Āḻvār also acquires a similar stature and is said to thaw down like ice. And now, the Āḻvār sees the very elements, water, wind and lire, as comrades-in-distress, and weeps along with them, bespeaking the intensity of his God-thirst, not conforming to the conventional norms of thinking and behaviour, (aphorism 132 of Ācārya Hṛdayam).




## 2.1.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கோள் பட்ட சிந்தையையாய்க் கூர்வாய அன்றிலே,  
சேண் பட்டயாமங்கள் சேராது இரங்குதியால்,  
ஆள் பட்ட எம்மேபோல், நீயும் அரவு அணையான்,  
தாள் பட்ட தண் துழாய்த் தாமம் காமுற்றாயே.

kōḷ paṭṭa cintaiyaiyāyk kūrvāya aṉṟilē,  
cēṇ paṭṭayāmaṅkaḷ cērātu iraṅkutiyāl,  
āḷ paṭṭa emmēpōl, nīyum aravu aṇaiyāṉ,  
tāḷ paṭṭa taṇ tuḻāyt tāmam kāmuṟṟāyē.

**English translation of verse 2.1.2:**

Ye Aṉṟil with beak sharp, down-hearted that you are,  
Your voice is feeble and without sleep you suffer  
During long spells of night; did you also covet  
As I do, the cool tulaci garland at the feet  
Of the Lord, reclining on His serpent couch?

**Note**

Just as he was addressing the stork, the Āḻvār heard the Aṉṟil birds in the neighbouring palmyra tree, crying out their agony of separation, as and when their bills got unlocked during sleep, vide also the preamble to this decad. The Āḻvār extends his sympathy to these birds, looking upon them as comrades-in-distress.




## 2.1.3
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

காமுற்ற கையறவோடு எல்லே இராப்பகல்,  
நீ முற்றக் கண்துயிலாய் நெஞ்சு உருகி ஏங்குதியால்,  
தீ முற்றத் தென் இலங்கை ஊட்டினான் தாள் நயந்த,  
யாம் உற்றது உற்றாயோ? வாழி கனை கடலே

kāmuṟṟa kaiyaṟavōṭu ellē irāppakal,  
nī muṟṟak kaṇtuyilāy neñcu uruki ēṅkutiyāl,  
tī muṟṟat teṉ ilaṅkai ūṭṭiṉāṉ tāḷ nayanta,  
yām uṟṟatu uṟṟāyō? vāḻi kaṉai kaṭalē

**English translation of verse 2.1.3:**

You languish without sleep, You roaring Sea!  
Both day and night, and your heart is watery, I see;  
Are you with grief afflicted as we are,  
Not attaining the feet of our Lord Who by fire  
Destroyed Laṅkā? May you from grief be free and prosper!

**Notes**

\(i\) The Sea can be said to sleep when it is silent without throwing the waves up. But the waves are surging up and down all the time, be it day or night; this sleeplessness is attributed by the Āḻvār to its separation from the Lord.

\(ii\) The sea roars and it is mere sound with no meaning, just like the indistinct sound coming from a throat, choked with grief. The Āḻvār is inclined to think that the poor thing is down with grief, too deep for words.

\(iii\) The Āḻvār would appear to tell the sea: “Sītā was also a woman like me, and Śrī Rāma languished without food and sleep, bunded the Sea, a herculean task indeed, and got at her. He is, however, unmindful of me. Do you also feel tortured by His indifference, as I do?”




## 2.1.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கடலும் மலையும் விசும்பும் துழாய் எம்போல்,  
சுடர் கொள் இராப்பகல் துஞ்சாயால் தண் வாடாய்,  
அடல் கொள் படை ஆழி அம்மானைக் காண்பான் நீ,  
உடலம் நோய் உற்றாயோ ஊழிதோறு ஊழியே.

kaṭalum malaiyum vicumpum tuḻāy empōl,  
cuṭar koḷ irāppakal tuñcāyāl taṇ vāṭāy,  
aṭal koḷ paṭai āḻi ammāṉaik kāṇpāṉ nī,  
uṭalam nōy uṟṟāyō ūḻitōṟu ūḻiyē.

**English translation of verse 2.1.4:**

Do you from chronic malady suffer, you chill wind?  
Like me you sleep not, by day or night, but try to find  
Groping thro’ space, hill and dale, our mighty Lord  
Who does, in sweet array. Conch and Discuss wield.

**Notes**

\(i\) If the wind is chill, the Āḻvār thinks it is due to delirium; i f the wind moves about, all over, all the time, gathering all the dust in the process, as is its wont, the Āḻvār thinks that it goes in search of the Lord with the frantic fervour of an importunate lover who dashes off, breaking all norms of feminine conduct, disfigures herself and musters public opinion for the acceleration of her union with her beloved.

\(ii\) Periyāḻvār searched for the Lord in the milk ocean; Tirumaṅkai Āḻvār went roving round Tiruvēṅkaṭam, the Hill station and other pilgrim centres down below, playing the role of the importunate lover, referred to in (I) above. And here, Nammāḻvār is inclined to think that the wind is also a kindred soul, exhibiting a similar behaviour.




## 2.1.5
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஊழிதோறு ஊழி உலகுக்கு நீர்கொண்டு,  
தோழியரும் யாமும் போல் நீராய் நெகிழ்கின்ற,  
வாழிய வானமே நீயும் மதுசூதன்,  
பாழிமையில் பட்டு அவன்கண் பாசத்தால் நைவாயே.

ūḻitōṟu ūḻi ulakukku nīrkoṇṭu,  
tōḻiyarum yāmum pōl nīrāy nekiḻkiṉṟa,  
vāḻiya vāṉamē nīyum matucūtaṉ,  
pāḻimaiyil paṭṭu avaṉkaṇ pācattāl naivāyē.

**English translation of verse 2.1.5:**

Ye clouds, into tears you break for ever  
And flood the worlds; do you in sorrow dwindle  
Like me and my comrades, under the spell irresistible  
Of Matucūtaṉ, coveting Him heart and soul?  
May you from misery be free and prosper!

**Notes**

\(i\) It is clear from this, that Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī and comrades of her ilk are grief-stricken to such an extent that their profuse tears flood the worlds like the rain-water unleashed by the clouds.

\(ii\) Matucūtaṉ (Madhusūdha)–Lord Mahā Viṣṇu, Who slew Madhu, the demon. The Āḻvār queries whether the clouds did also come under the spell of the Lord, attracted by His glorious trait of vanquishing the evil forces, in the same way as he and others of his ilk did.




## 2.1.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நைவாய எம்மேபோல் நாள் மதியே நீ இந் நாள்,  
மை வான் இருள் அகற்றாய் மாழாந்து தேம்புதியால்,  
ஐ வாய் அரவு அணைமேல் ஆழிப் பெருமானார்,  
மெய் வாசகம் கேட்டு உன் மெய்ந்நீர்மை தோற்றாயே

naivāya emmēpōl nāḷ matiyē nī in nāḷ,  
mai vāṉ iruḷ akaṟṟāy māḻāntu tēmputiyāl,  
ai vāy aravu aṇaimēl āḻip perumāṉār,  
mey vācakam kēṭṭu uṉ meynnīrmai tōṟṟāyē

**English translation of verse 2.1.6:**

Worn out like us, you withering Moon!  
These days, the dark sky you don’t illumine;  
You have, it seems, lost your erstwhile sheen,  
Misled by the utterance of the Lord who the discus holds,  
Reclining on the serpent with its five hoods.

**Notes**

\(i\) The Moon waxes and wanes because of its different phases, but Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī attributes the waning of the Moon and the resultant diminution of its brightness to a mental malady, on a par with her own.

\(ii\) In her present state of mental depression, the Nāyakī is so sore with the Lord that she says that the Lord’s utterances should not be taken at their face value. No doubt, Śrī Rāma averred that his tongue shall never lie. Unfortunately, however, the Āḻvār reproaches the Lord as being double-tongued like the serpent on which He reclines. The serpent has a double-forked tongue in each of its hoods and here is a serpent with five hoods. And then, it was with His discus that the Lord covered the Sun and converted day into the illusory night; thus, the discus was a pawn in the game, an accomplice of the Lord for carrying out the strategy. If, as Śrī Rāma, the Lord scrupulously adhered to truth, as Śrī Kṛṣṇa, He would not mind swerving from it, if thereby He could do a good turn to His devotees. It could not, therefore, be said that the Lord was guilty of falsehood, merely sticking to the letter with academic zeal, without going into the spiritbehind His actions. The Lord is beneficial to His is devotees both ways, by adhering to the truth, as Śri Rāma did, and swerving from it, as Śrī Kṛṣṇa did. Nunipiḷḷai observed: “We seek shelter alike in Rāma’s truthfulness and Kṛṣṇa’s diplomacy (seeming falsehoods).




## 2.1.7
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

தோற்றோம் மட நெஞ்சம் எம் பெருமான் நாரணற்கு எம்  
ஆற்றாமை சொல்லி அழுவோமை நீநடுவே,  
வேற்றோர் வகையில் கொடிதாய் எனை ஊழி,  
மாற்றாண்மை நிற்றியோ வாழி கனை இருளே.

tōṟṟōm maṭa neñcam em perumāṉ nāraṇaṟku em  
āṟṟāmai colli aḻuvōmai nīnaṭuvē,  
vēṟṟōr vakaiyil koṭitāy eṉai ūḻi,  
māṟṟāṇmai niṟṟiyō vāḻi kaṉai iruḷē.

**English translation of verse 2.1.7:**

We have unto Nāraṇaṉ, Our Lord  
Lost our hearts and we did our sorrows lament  
In each other’s company but step in you did,  
Worse than our foes you are, you darksome night!  
May you prosper and from this state be rid.

**Notes**

\(i\) This stanza, as worded above, does not accord with the pattern of the preceding and succeeding stanzas in this decad. Based, however, oṇ the diction as such, Emperumāṉar (Rāmānuja) and other Ācāryas were inclined to interpret this soṇg, as follows: The dark night, instead of weeping along with Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī and her comrades, is worse than a foe, in so far as it prevents their seeing each other and bemoaning their common lot of separation from the Lord.

\(ii\) There is, however, another method of interpreting this stanza, so as to bring it on a piece with the rest. Not knowing that darkness is an inherent quality of the night, Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī sympathises with it and exclaims, “We are already weighed down by our own calamity and here you are, exhibiting your own dire distress of darkness and adding to our miseries. May you soon be rid of this state and prosper!”




## 2.1.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

இருளின் திணி வண்ணம் மாநீர்க்கழியே போய்,  
மருளுற்று இராப்பகல் துஞ்சிலும் நீ துஞ்சாயால்,  
உருளும் சகடம் உதைத்த பெருமானார்,  
அருளின் பெரு நசையால் ஆழாந்து நொந்தாயே.

iruḷiṉ tiṇi vaṇṇam mānīrkkaḻiyē pōy,  
maruḷuṟṟu irāppakal tuñcilum nī tuñcāyāl,  
uruḷum cakaṭam utaitta perumāṉār,  
aruḷiṉ peru nacaiyāl āḻāntu nontāyē.

**English translation of verse 2.1.8:**

You channel, the dark waters in abundance  
You discharge, day and night, bewildered;  
Do you also pine, with deep desire, for the grace  
Of the Lord who the (demon in the) rolling wheel shattered?

**Note**

Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī gropes her way through, in darkness, and not being able to distinguish land from water, comes to a channel discharging lots of water and making plenty of noise in the process. She thinks that the channel is also lamenting its separation from Lord Kṛṣṇa, who destroyed Śakaṭāsura and whose grace it pines for.




## 2.1.9
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நொந்து ஆராக் காதல் நோய் மெல் ஆவி உள் உலர்த்த,  
நந்தா விளக்கமே, நீயும் அளியத்தாய்,  
செந்தாமரைத் தடங்கண் செங்கனி வாய் எம் பெருமான்,  
அம் தாமம் தண் துழாய் ஆசையால் வேவாயே.

nontu ārāk kātal nōy mel āvi uḷ ulartta,  
nantā viḷakkamē, nīyum aḷiyattāy,  
centāmarait taṭaṅkaṇ ceṅkaṉi vāy em perumāṉ,  
am tāmam taṇ tuḻāy ācaiyāl vēvāyē.

**English translation of verse 2.1.9:**

You undying flame, sad indeed is your plight.  
Your gentle soul stands withered; burnt are you  
By the desire to get the tulacī garland, cool and bright,  
Worn by our Lord with large lotus-eyes and lips of red hue?

**Notes**

\(i\) Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī returns home in a state of mental exhaustion, and sees the burning lamp. The heat of the flame, she thinks, is the one generated by its separation from the Lord, an experience identical with hers.

\(ii\) The flame of the lamp is not homogeneous, being of different intensity of heat at different places or zones, as they are called; the flame itself comes up anew every moment, a fuel which can be gathered only by inference. It is an optical illusion that the flame appears to be single, instead of an unbroken succession of different flames. Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī goes by what she sees and calls it an undying flame.




## 2.1.10
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வேவு ஆரா வேட்கை நோய் மெல் ஆவி உள் உலர்த்த,  
ஓவாது இராப்பகல் உன்பாலே வீழ்த்து ஒழிந்தாய்,  
மா வாய் பிளந்து மருதிடை போய் மண் அளந்த,  
மூவா முதல்வா இனி எம்மைச் சோரேலே.

vēvu ārā vēṭkai nōy mel āvi uḷ ulartta,  
ōvātu irāppakal uṉpālē vīḻttu oḻintāy,  
mā vāy piḷantu marutiṭai pōy maṇ aḷanta,  
mūvā mutalvā iṉi emmaic cōrēlē.

**English translation of verse 2.1.10:**

Primate of perennial youth, the horse’s (Kēci, the demons) big mouth you split,  
‘Tween the twin trees you crawled and broke them down,  
The worlds you measured; in you engrossed, day and night,  
Our tender souls, with blistering malady of love struck down,  
Have badly dried up, pray, henceforth leave us not.

**Note**

Seeing the Āḻvār’s pangs of separation from Him, the Lord approaches the Āḻvār, shedding His cool grace. Thereupon, the Lord is told by the Āḻvār that his tender soul, already worn out and emaciated due to its separation from the Lord, thaws down still further in contemplation of His wondrous deeds anti glorious traits. The Āḻvār also fervently prays to the Lord, not to forsake him any more.




## 2.1.11
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

சோராத எப் பொருட்கும் ஆதியாம் சோதிக்கே,  
ஆராத காதல் குருகூர்ச் சடகோபன்,  
ஓராயிரம் சொன்ன அவற்றுள் இவை பத்தும்,  
சோரார் விடார் கண்டீர் வைகுந்தம் திண்ணனவே.

cōrāta ep poruṭkum ātiyām cōtikkē,  
ārāta kātal kurukūrc caṭakōpaṉ,  
ōrāyiram coṉṉa avaṟṟuḷ ivai pattum,  
cōrār viṭār kaṇṭīr vaikuntam tiṇṇaṉavē.

**English translation of verse 2.1.11:**

Those that are regular in reciting these stanzas ten,  
Out of the thousand composed by Kurukūr Caṭakōpaṉ,  
Of love insatiable for the resplendent Lord, the root cause  
Of one and all, shall surely enjoy for ever, Heavenly bliss.

**Notes**

\(i\) It is only after the Lord came and joined the Āḻvār that He became God indeed, the Protector of oṇe and all, *without any exception*; again, the Lord became resplendent, only after His union with the Āḻvār.

\(ii\) It is also noteworthy that, In this decad, the Āḻvār has come to be identified through his boundless love for the Lord; that is why he is referred to not as mere Kurukūr Caṭakōpaṉ but as Caṭakōpaṉ of insatiable God-love.
