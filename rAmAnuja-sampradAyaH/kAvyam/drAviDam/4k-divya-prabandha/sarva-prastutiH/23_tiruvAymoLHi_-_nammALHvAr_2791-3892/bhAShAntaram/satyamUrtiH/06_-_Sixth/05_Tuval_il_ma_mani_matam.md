## 00 Intro6.5
The theme of Nāyakī, Mother and Mate, that is, the Āḻvār expressing himself in the vein of a female lover, her mother and mate, by turns, has already been dealt with, *in extenso*, in the preamble to 1-4. Of the hundred decads, comprised in this work, as many as seventeen reflect the ‘Nāyakī’ aspect, seven are put in the mouth of the Mother and three voiced forth, by the mates. Taking this Sixth Centum alone, VI-1, VI-2 and VI-8 are the utterances of Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī, this one, the song of the mate while VI-6 and VI-7 are ascribed to the Mother. Thus, this centum reflects all the three types, like the fourth centum. As already elucidated, all these songs were, of course, the compositions of the Āḻvār, though ascribed to three different agencies, like unto the waters of the main river being conveyed through different channels. But then, let us now examine the necessity for the songs, in this decad, being put in the mouth of the mate.

In V-6, we saw the Lord’s glory and grandeur, enumerated by Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī, possessed by the Lord. And now, the Āḻvār wishes to give expression to the depth of his love unto God. This only redounds to the greatness of the Lord, because all the auspicious qualities of the Lord and His unique prowess will go unheard, unnoticed and unsung but for His devotees who can revel in them and recount, just like the cool southerly breeze blowing in a depopulated place like the forest or the moonshine in the wilderness. Did not Periyāḻvār, in his opening song of benediction, pray for long life for himself also, so that he could keep on singing the Lord’s praise and praying for His safety? Is not Saint Nammāḻvār the Lord’s poet and will not the Āḻvār’s greatness be, therefore, but a reflection of the Lord’s own? Even so, it would not be quite appropriate for him to sing his own glory, albeit the reflected glory of God. And so, the mates are pressed into service and, in essence, it is the exposition of the Āḻvār’s God-love, Godhunger and God-thirst, by some of the devotees. Thus, in this decad, the mates are telling the elderly women around about the profusion of the Āḻvār’s love unto the Lord, enshrined in ‘Tolai—villimaṅkalam’, a pilgrim centre in the deep South (Tamilnādu) near about Āḻvār Tirunakari (Kurukūr), the birth place of the Āḻvār.




## 6.5.1
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

துவள் இல் மா மணி மாடம் ஓங்கு தொலைவில்லிமங்கலம் தொழும்  
இவளை நீர் இனி அன்னைமீர்! உமக்கு ஆசை இல்லை விடுமினோ,  
தவள ஒண் சங்கு சக்கரம் என்றும் தாமரைத் தடம் கண் என்றும்,  
குவளை ஒண் மலர்க் கண்கள் நீர் மல்க நின்று நின்று குமுறுமே.

tuvaḷ il mā maṇi māṭam ōṅku tolaivillimaṅkalam toḻum  
ivaḷai nīr iṉi aṉṉaimīr! umakku ācai illai viṭumiṉō,  
tavaḷa oṇ caṅku cakkaram eṉṟum tāmarait taṭam kaṇ eṉṟum,  
kuvaḷai oṇ malark kaṇkaḷ nīr malka niṉṟu niṉṟu kumuṟumē.

**English translation of verse 6.5.1:**

Ye, mothers, this lady is unto you lost henceforth,  
Better give up all hopes of her, who the Lord does adore  
In Tolaivillimaṅkalam where stand tall castles paved with gems flawless,  
With a mind that whirls and tears welling in her flowery eyes;  
Utter she can’t the words she feels the urge to express,  
“The Lord’s lotus eyes broad and His lovely white conch and discus”.

### Note

King Janaka showed the horoscope of baby Sītā to the court astrologers. While predicting her great good fortune of getting married to the Supreme Lord and all that, they also foretold her exile into the forests. So also, when Caṭakōpaṉ was born, his parents elicited from the astrologers that he would be endowed with supreme knowledge and become world famous and yet, there was the great risk of their losing him, if ever they took him to Tolaivillimaṅkalam. The devout parents could not, however, resist the natural urge to take their child to the shrine in the forbidden place, come what may. The high destiny of the God-bound souls and their aim, none and nothing can avert. The resultant position, insofar as Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī is concerned, the prophesy come true, is set out here by her mates. Actually, the mates come into the picture, only when the elderly women seek their aid for finding a way out of the trancestate into which the Nāyakī has worked herself up, on seeing minutely every little bit of the pilgrim centre, the temple and the Deity. Temples and pilgrim centres are not places to hurry through, like a race-horse, but to be paced through leisurely, reverentially beholding the towers and turrets. The buildings loom large in the rapturous eyes of the Nāyakī and look like tall castles, paved with flawless rubies. And then, she beholds the Lord’s enthralling Form, His holy weapons and ornaments and gets completely absorbed in admiration of them all. She stands isolated from her folks and finding that she has gone out of hand, the elders seek the good offices of her mates to pull her out of this engrossment. But the mates haven’t anything encouraging to say nor is there any point in putting up a bund after all the water has escaped. They do not mince matters either; they admonish the elders for having brought the Nāyakī to this pilgrim centre, knowing full well her susceptibilities. At the same time, the mates throw a very useful hint to the elders, that they would do well to follow in the Nāyakī’s foot-steps and get absorbed in the Deity and the surroundings, rather than give her up, as incorrigible. It is indeed a sight for Gods, the ravishing love of the Saint, throbbing with Godlove, during those blissful moments of communion with the Lord. The Elders are, therefore, advised by the mates to behold, with admiration, the rapturous state of the Nāyakī whose expression falters, choked with emotion, like unto a cow, whose calf is tethered, away from her, pining for the calf to be fed with the milk welling up her teats and yet, unable to express, by mouth, her painful longing to reach her calf.




## 6.5.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

குமுறும் ஓசை விழவு ஒலித் தொலைவில்லிமங்கலம் கொண்டுபுக்கு,  
அமுத மென் மொழியாளை நீர் உமக்கு ஆசை இன்றி அகற்றினீர்,  
திமிர் கொண்டால் ஒத்து நிற்கும் மற்று இவள்தேவ தேவபிரான் என்றே,  
நிமியும் வாயொடு கண்கள் நீர் மல்க நெக்கு ஒசிந்து கரையுமே.

kumuṟum ōcai viḻavu olit tolaivillimaṅkalam koṇṭupukku,  
amuta meṉ moḻiyāḷai nīr umakku ācai iṉṟi akaṟṟiṉīr,  
timir koṇṭāl ottu niṟkum maṟṟu ivaḷtēva tēvapirāṉ eṉṟē,  
nimiyum vāyoṭu kaṇkaḷ nīr malka nekku ocintu karaiyumē.

**English translation of verse 6.5.2:**

Ye, elders, brought you have to a point of no return,  
This lady with a tongue, sweet and soft, having taken  
Her to Toḷaiviḻlimaṅkaḻam with its fan-fare of festivals;  
Dazed she remains and mention of the name of the Lord universal  
Twists her mouth and brings forth tears in abundance  
From her eyes and keeps she withering down..

### Notes

\(i\) Even the normal environment of Tolaivillimaṅkalam is enticing enough and what to talk of the festivities, with their rich and varied fares! The elders having brought the God-bent Nāyakī during the festival going on there, they stand no chance whatever of weaning her away from the Lord and the allied attractions. Incidentally, we get at the Śāstraik meaning that we would do well to get initiated into God-head through our elders, rather than the direct approach.

\(ii\) Could there be a tongue sweeter than that of the Lord's poet, singing the glory of that Insatiable Nectar? For the devout, the Āḻvār provides the nectarean hymrs to drink deep from.

\(iii\) The Nāyakī stands speechless like the profound Brahma Jñāni who scarcely speaks out. In the sixth prapāṭaka of Cāndogyopaniṣad, Svetaketu comes home after undergoing a twelve-year course of instruction (Gurukulavāsa) and finding him tongue-tied, his father instantly perceives that the boy has acquired Brahma Jñāna.




## 6.5.3
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கரை கொள் பைம் பொழில் தண்பணைத் தொலைவில்லிமங்கலம் கொண்டுபுக்கு,  
உரை கொள் இன் மொழியாளை நீர் உமக்கு ஆசை இன்றி அகற்றினீர்,  
திரை கொள் பௌவத்துச் சேர்ந்ததும் திசை ஞாலம் தாவி அளந்ததும்,  
நிரைகள் மேய்த்ததுமே பிதற்றி நெடும் கண் நீர் மல்க நிற்குமே.

urai koḷ iṉ moḻiyāḷai nīr umakku ācai iṉṟi akaṟṟiṉīr,  
tirai koḷ pauvattuc cērntatum ticai ñālam tāvi aḷantatum,  
niraikaḷ mēyttatumē pitaṟṟi neṭum kaṇ nīr malka niṟkumē.

**English translation of verse 6.5.3:**

Ye, mothers, your hold on this sweet-tongued lady is gone,  
For you brought her to Tolaivillimaṅkalam with fertile fields and orchards fine,  
On the river bank; utter she does how unto the Milky-ocean  
The Lord came, how He spanned the sprawling Earth and grazed  
The cattle herds and as tears well up her longish eyes, she stands dazed.

### Notes

\(i\) *Sweet tongued*: The Āḻvār’s hymns are very sweet to hear and when one delves into their meanings, the commentaries, however numerous and copious they might be, one cannot plumb their depth fully.

\(ii\) The elders cannot coax the Nāyakī and get her dislodged from this pilgrim centre, even as it would not be possible to induce the fertile fields and the orchards fed by the waters from the river Tāmraparṇi to get uprooted and proceed with them; in other words, the Nāyakī stands as firmly rooted there as the fields and orchards themselves.




## 6.5.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நிற்கும் நால்மறைவாணர் வாழ் தொலைவில்லிமங்கலம் கண்டபின்,  
அற்கம் ஒன்றும் அற உறாள் மலிந்தாள் கண்டீர் இவள் அன்னைமீர்,  
கற்கும் கல்வி எல்லாம் கருங்கடல் வண்ணன் கண்ண பிரான் என்றே,  
ஒற்கம் ஒன்றும் இலள் உகந்து உகந்து உள் மகிழ்ந்து குழையுமே.

niṟkum nālmaṟaivāṇar vāḻ tolaivillimaṅkalam kaṇṭapiṉ,  
aṟkam oṉṟum aṟa uṟāḷ malintāḷ kaṇṭīr ivaḷ aṉṉaimīr,  
kaṟkum kalvi ellām karuṅkaṭal vaṇṇaṉ kaṇṇa pirāṉ eṉṟē,  
oṟkam oṉṟum ilaḷ ukantu ukantu uḷ makiḻntu kuḻaiyumē.

**English translation of verse 6.5.4:**

Ye, elders, this lady has ceased to be modest in the least  
After beholding Tolaivillimaṅkalam, the Vedic scholars’ seat;  
All her talks centre round Kaṇṇapirāṉ, the sea-hued Lord  
And with no reserve, she thaws down, overjoyed.

**Note**

The Nāyakī was overwhelmed by the sweet chanting of the Vedas in Tolaivillimaṅkalam and she started musing over the Lord Who disseminated the Vedas, at the commencement of the epoch, to the four-headed Brahmā. Her innate modesty is no longer there, in her present rapturous state, and she openly rejoices, speaking solely about the Lord, the ultimate goal of all learning and knowledge.




## 6.5.5
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

குழையும் வாள் முகத்து ஏழையைத் தொலைவில்லிமங்கலம் கொண்டுபுக்கு,  
இழை கொள் சோதிச் செந்தாமரைக் கண்பிரான் இருந்தமை காட்டினீர்,  
மழை பெய்தால் ஒக்கும் கண்ண நீரினொடு அன்று தொட்டும் மையாந்து, இவள்  
நுழையும் சிந்தையள் அன்னைமீர்! தொழும் அத் திசை உற்று நோக்கியே.

kuḻaiyum vāḷ mukattu ēḻaiyait tolaivillimaṅkalam koṇṭupukku,  
iḻai koḷ cōtic centāmaraik kaṇpirāṉ iruntamai kāṭṭiṉīr,  
maḻai peytāl okkum kaṇṇa nīriṉoṭu aṉṟu toṭṭum maiyāntu, ivaḷ  
nuḻaiyum cintaiyaḷ aṉṉaimīr! toḻum at ticai uṟṟu nōkkiyē.

**English translation of verse 6.5.5:**

Ye, mothers, this lady with forehead bright, deeply absorbed  
In the Lord’s auspicious traits, unto Tolaivillimaṅkalam you brought  
And showed her the lotus-eyed Lord of bejewelled radiance;  
Rapturous she is since, with tears torrential in her eyes  
And with a heart in His beauty rooted, in that very direction she gazes.

### Notes

\(i\) The effulgence of the God-love within is reflected on the Nāyakī’s forehead. By her very nature, she would thaw down in ecstasy, in deep contemplation of the Lord and now that she has been brought by the elders, face to face, with the radiant Lord, bedecked with jewels, at Tolaivillimaṅkalam, her God-intoxication has gone to a very high pitch. The Lord, even when unadorned, is extremely charming and now, He is adorned, imparting lustre to the Jewels on His person. Unto Him, so exquisite, the elders brought the Nāyakī who just fainted in ecstasy and even after she recovered, she would not lift her mind off Him and kept gazing in the direction of the Pilgrim centre, c.f. ‘Ekastha hṛdayā nūnaṃ Rāmamevānupaśyati’ (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Sundara Kāṇḍa) So then, the chances of the elders getting the Nāyakī restored to them were next to nil. The Nāyakī’s love is unceasingly whirling, like the whirlpool in a stream, boring deeper and deeper but never scattering and passing away.

\(ii\) *The torrential tears*: When Maṇakkāl Nampi discoursed about God, Āḷavantār (later. Saint Yāmunācārya), the Royal listener caught the spark all right and exclaimed that he Just can’t exist without beholding Him. Struck by this wonderful response, the great preceptor led Āḷavantār to the august presence of Lord Raṅganātha, on seeing Whom. Yāmuna broke into tears, full and flooding. Like unto the dry match-stick, which readily strikes fire, the devout have but to be told about God and the heart immediately yearns to see Him; He has but to be seen and it makes them weep with tears of joy like Saint Nammāḻvār.




## 6.5.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நோக்கும் பக்கம் எல்லாம் கரும்பொடு செந்நெல்ஓங்கு செந்தாமரை,  
வாய்க்கும் தண் பொருநல் வடகரை வண் தொலைவில்லிமங்கலம்,  
நோக்குமேல் அத்திசை அல்லால் மறு நோக்கு இலள் வைகல் நாள்தொறும்,

**English translation of verse 6.5.6:**

Ye, elders, off Tolaivillimaṅkalam. the lovely city on the north bank  
Of the cool Porunal, full of red lotus flowers in the tanks.  
Where stand Sugar-canes and paddy crops tall, where’er one turns,  
This young lady, her eyes can’t lift and utters she the words,  
At all times, spelling out only the names of the gem-hued Lord.

### Notes

\(i\) Mostly, the Nāyakī is in a trance state and she seldom opens her eyes; if ever she did open the eyes and saw anything, it was only this pilgrim centre with its romantic setting on the north bank of Tāmraparṇi (also known as Porunal), the cool river. If she opened her mouth, she would only spell out the Lord's glorious names. Well, these are the observations of the mate.

\(ii\) In its esoteric meaning, the sweet sugar-cane denotes the devout, with a sweet bearing and disposition; the rich paddy crops, bent with the weight of the grains on the stalks, betoken the men of great learning, full of humility,




## 6.5.7
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அன்னைமீர்! அணிமாமயில் சிறுமான் இவள் நம்மைக் கைவலிந்து  
என்ன வார்த்தையும் கேட்குறாள் தொலைவில்லிமங்கலம் என்று அல்லால்,  
முன்னம் நோற்ற விதிகொலோ முகில் வண்ணன் மாயம் கொலோ, அவன்  
சின்னமும் திருநாமமும் இவள் வாயனகள் திருந்தவே.

aṉṉaimīr! aṇimāmayil ciṟumāṉ ivaḷ nammaik kaivalintu  
eṉṉa vārttaiyum kēṭkuṟāḷ tolaivillimaṅkalam eṉṟu allāl,  
muṉṉam nōṟṟa vitikolō mukil vaṇṇaṉ māyam kolō, avaṉ  
ciṉṉamum tirunāmamum ivaḷ vāyaṉakaḷ tiruntavē.

**English translation of verse 6.5.7:**

Ye, mothers, this lady sweet, like the lovely peacock and the doe young,  
Has out of our hands gone and she wouldn’t hear about anything  
But Tolaivillimaṇkalam; could this felicity on her devolve  
By dint of accumulated merit or the cloud-hued Lord’s sweet resolve?  
How distinct does she spell out His names and attributes!

### Notes

\(i\) The Nāyakī’s lovely locks of hair are compared to the colourful plumes of the peacock and her bewitching eyes to those of the young doe.

\(ii\) The Lord’s names and attributes gain colour, when they are spelt out by His devotees with inimitable fervour, as when Śrī Parāśara Bhaṭṭar sweetly ejaculated the holy name, “Aḻakiya maṇavāḻapperumāḷ!” (Lovely Spouse), Śrī Śomāśi Āṇṭāṉ entoned “Emperumāṉār!” (My own Lord, an epithet of Śrī Rāmānuja) and Anantāḻvaṉ uttered the holy name “Tiruvēṅkaṭam uṭāiyāṉ!” (The Lord of the holy hill, Tirupathi). It has been said that Vālmīki Bhagavān could impart special lustre to Rāmāyaṇa. The mate wonders whether all this felicity, the Nāyakī currently enjoys, could have accrued to her, by dint of her own merit and is led to think that it could be but the Lord’s sweet spontaneous grace.




## 6.5.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

திருந்து வேதமும் வேள்வியும் திருமா மகளிரும் தாம், மலிந்து  
இருந்து வாழ் பொருநல் வடகரை வண் தொலைவில்லிமங்கலம்,  
கருந் தடம் கண்ணி கைதொழுத அந்நாள் தொடங்கி இந் நாள்தொறும்  
இருந்து இருந்து 'அரவிந்தலோசன!' என்று என்றே நைந்து இரங்குமே.

tiruntu vētamum vēḷviyum tirumā makaḷirum tām, malintu  
iruntu vāḻ porunal vaṭakarai vaṇ tolaivillimaṅkalam,  
karun taṭam kaṇṇi kaitoḻuta annāḷ toṭaṅki in nāḷtoṟum  
iruntu iruntu 'aravintalōcaṉa!' eṉṟu eṉṟē naintu iraṅkumē.

**English translation of verse 6.5.8:**

Ye. elders, ever since this lady, with dark eyes large,  
Started adoring Tolaivillimaṅkalam, the affluent city  
On the north bank of river Porumal, full of felicity,  
With scrupulous vedic chantings and rituals well done,  
She calls out now and then, ‘My lotus-eyed Lord’, and dwindles down.

### Note

The Nāyakī’s eyes became dark through their absorption of. and deep penetration into the dark-hued Lord. From the moment, she worshipped the Lord, enshrined in this pilgrim centre, she got entranced by His lotus eyes and thawed down, when she addressed Him, as her lotus-eyed Lord. She couldn’t go on repeating it, much as she would like to, as she dwindled down in a state of ecstasy.




## 6.5.9
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

இரங்கி நாள்தொறும் வாய்வெரீஇ இவள் கண்ண நீர்கள் அலமர,  
மரங்களும் இரங்கும் வகை 'மணிவண்ணவோ!' என்று கூவுமால்,  
துரங்கம் வாய் பிளந்தான் உறை தொலைவில்லிமங்கலம் என்று, தன்  
கரங்கள் கூப்பித் தொழும் அவ்ஊர்த் திருநாமம் கற்றதன் பின்னையே.

iraṅki nāḷtoṟum vāyverīi ivaḷ kaṇṇa nīrkaḷ alamara,  
maraṅkaḷum iraṅkum vakai 'maṇivaṇṇavō!' eṉṟu kūvumāl,  
turaṅkam vāy piḷantāṉ uṟai tolaivillimaṅkalam eṉṟu, taṉ  
karaṅkaḷ kūppit toḻum avūrt tirunāmam kaṟṟataṉ piṉṉaiyē.

**English translation of verse 6.5.9:**

Ye, mothers, this young lady calls out, “oh, gem-hued Lord!”  
Day in and day out, with her mind deeply absorbed,  
And tears splashing down her eyes, moving trees besides;  
Ever since she learnt the name of that city, Tolaivillimaṅkalam, where resides  
The Lord who tore open the mouth of the demoniac horse,  
In that direction she turns and with joined palms adores.

### Note

Having been initiated into this pilgrim centre, the Nāyakī keeps on reciting the Lord’s name, in such a manner that even the inanimate beings, like trees, are moved. If these hymns can move even the stony hearts of the uninitiated men of the present day, what doubt could there be about their impact on the contemporary men and things, when the songs flowed from the Āḻvār’s rapturous lips! When Lord Kṛṣṇa played on the flute, Periyāḻvār would have it, that the trees shed honey in copious quantities, the flowers started falling down and the boughs bent down, in admiration. The voice of the yearning soul of the Āḻvār, with its mellifluity galore, would have doubtless made things around him react likewise. In fact, the mate says ‘that city in line 4 of the song, because she cannot reproduce the sweetness with which the Nāyakī spells out ‘Tiruttolaivillimaṅkalam.’




## 6.5.10
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

பின்னைகொல் நிலமாமகள்கொல்? திருமகள்கொல் பிறந்திட்டாள்,  
என்ன மாயம்கொலோ? இவள் நெடுமால் என்றே நின்று கூவுமால்,  
முன்னி வந்து அவன் நின்று இருந்து உறையும் தொலைவில்லிமங்கலம்-  
சென்னியால் வணங்கும் அவ் ஊர்த் திருநாமம் கேட்பது சிந்தையே.

piṉṉaikol nilamāmakaḷkol? tirumakaḷkol piṟantiṭṭāḷ,

muṉṉi vantu avaṉ niṉṟu iruntu uṟaiyum tolaivillimaṅkalam-  
ceṉṉiyāl vaṇaṅkum av ūrt tirunāmam kēṭpatu cintaiyē.

**English translation of verse 6.5.10:**

Perhaps this lady is Piṇṇai or Nilamakaḻ (Mother Earth), full of grace  
Or Tirumakaḻ (Mahālakṣmī) herself, what a wonder it is, she keeps calling out  
Neṭumāl (the all-pervading Lord) and bows before Tolaivillimaṅkalam where He stays,  
And longs to hear the holy name of that place, by others spelt out!

### Notes

\(i\) Looking at the Nāyakī’s intense longing for Lord Kṛṣṇa, the mates guess that she might be Nappiṉṉā, reborn; and then, her rapturous meditation on the Lord’s advent as Varāha, the Great Boar, makes them inclined to think that she might be an incarnation of Mother Earth. But still, the mates could not make up their minds, as the Nāyakī’s devout contemplation of Lord Rāmā suggests the possibility of her being no less than Sītā, reborn. In his inimitable way, Nampiḷḷai would say that these divine consorts could, in certain respects, be compared to Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī, but she is of such incomparable excellence that one is left wondering whether she has taken this unique birth for the resuscitation of the whole world. What a wonder it is! Of course, anything can take place in the Lord’s Universe.

\(ii\) Her own love for the Lord is of enormous dimensions and yet, the Nāyakī is overwhelmed by the Lord’s love for her and calls Him out, in terms of His tall love, the allconquering.

\(iii\) The Nāyakī loves to hear the name of this pilgrim centre, uttered by some one instead of mouthing it herself. The Lord is said to have come down to Tolaivillimaṅkalam and taken up His residence there, well ahead of the Nāyakī, so as to prepare the ground for the generation, in her, of such intense God-love.




## 6.5.11
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

சிந்தையாலும் சொல்லாலும் செய்கையினாலும் தேவ பிரானையே,  
தந்தை தாய் என்று அடைந்த வண் குருகூரவர் சடகோபன்,  
முந்தை ஆயிரத்துள் இவை தொலை வில்லிமங்கலத்தைச் சொன்ன,

**English translation of verse 6.5.11:**

Those that can recite these songs ten,  
Which unto holy Tolaivillimaṅkalam pertain,  
Out of the hoary thousand composed by Caṭakōpaṉ,  
Of Kurukūr, who, by word, deed and thought, adored  
The Lord Supreme as Father, Mother and all, rolled  
In one, will service unto Him render for ever.

**Note**

*The hoary thousand*: It might be asked how this work is claimed to be antiquated while there is the distinct reference to Āḻvār as its author. The element of antiquity comes in automatically if one considers the parity, which this Dramiḍa Veda enjoys with its Sanskrit counterpart. These thousand hymns were ordained by the Lord, just like the Sanskrit Vedas, as revealed by His own words in Bhagavad Gītā, “Śrutis smṛtir Mamaivājñā’; the veracity and blemishlessness. claimed for the Sanskrit Vedas, hold good equally for the Dramiḍa Veda (See aphorism 45 of Ācārya Hṛdayam).

The chanters of this decad will be blest to render service unto the Divine couple, without break or blemish, as Lakṣmaṇa did.
