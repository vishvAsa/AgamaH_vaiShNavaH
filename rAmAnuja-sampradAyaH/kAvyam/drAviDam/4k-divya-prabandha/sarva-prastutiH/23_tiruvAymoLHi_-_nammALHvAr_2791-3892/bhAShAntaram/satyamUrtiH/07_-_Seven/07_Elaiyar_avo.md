## 00 Intro7.7
The soul-stirring utterances of the Saint, as in the last decad, should indeed have gone straight to the Lord in Heaven. In a way, the Lord would seem to have pacified the Āḻvār by enabling him to comprehend mentally His exquisite Form, limb by limb. Led away by the Lord’s charming beauty, the Āḻvār, aims at physical enjoyment of the Lord’s exquisite Form, with outstretched hands and feels frustrated when such an experience is denied to him. Thrown into deep dejection, the Āḻvār, once again (figuratively) transformed as the Nāyakī, hits back the mates and elders. She asserts that she could hardly yield to their threats and cajoling, overwhelmed as she was by the Lord’s bewitching Form, in all its details, on a par with physical perception through the senses.

This decad is similar to V-5 and yet, there is a difference between the two. There was an alternation of the Āḻvār’s rejoicing and regret, in the earlier decad, while, in the current one, the expression of stinging regret dominates, in so far as the Āḻvār could not envision the Lord’s Form as a whole, but perceive only one limb, at a time, whetting his appetite, all the more, for visualising the Lord’s Form, in its entirety. In this peculiar context, the Nāyakī would look upon the bewitching eyes of the Lord’s as but death-dealing twins.




## 7.7.1
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஏழையர் ஆவிஉண்ணும் இணைக் கூற்றம்கொலோ அறியேன்,  
ஆழிஅம் கண்ணபிரான் திருக்கண்கள் கொலோ அறியேன்,  
சூழவும் தாமரை நாள்மலர் போல் வந்து தோன்றும்கண்டீர்,  
தோழியர்காள்! அன்னைமீர்! என்செய்கேன் துயராட்டியேனே? (2)

ēḻaiyar āviuṇṇum iṇaik kūṟṟamkolō aṟiyēṉ,  
āḻiam kaṇṇapirāṉ tirukkaṇkaḷ kolō aṟiyēṉ,  
cūḻavum tāmarai nāḷmalar pōl vantu tōṉṟumkaṇṭīr,  
tōḻiyarkāḷ! aṉṉaimīr! eṉceykēṉ tuyarāṭṭiyēṉē? (2)

**English translation of verse 7.7.1:**

Ye, mates and elders, I know not whether what I see  
Are death-dealing twins or the lovely eyes of Kaṇṇapirāṉ, the sea-hued Lord;  
Know ye that these are by me seen all around  
Like lotus flowers in full bloom, tormenting poor me  
And women-folks; how can I get over my distress indeed?

**Notes:**

Of all the limbs of the Lord, His lotus eyes, which kept the Āḻvār dumbfounded, presented themselves before him first, because it was the Lord’s bewitching eyes that attracted the Āḻvār unto Him, as confessed by him in the first of his four hymnals (*Tiruviruttam*). But then, why should he feel tormented by the vision instead of being delighted? Had the Lord’s Form, as a whole, been perceived by him, surely, he would have revelled in that glorious vision. But now, the Lord would appear to indulge in some cruel fun at the expense of the Āḻvār, by showing him His limbs, one by one, and watching his reaction thereto. The Āḻvār exclaims that these very eyes that attract the women-folks, could also prove fatal if their ardent aspirations to enjoy Him, roused by these eyes, are not fulfilled betimes. And again, being seen all round like lotus in full bloom, they oppress him without leaving him any chance to miss it by turning his attention elsewhere. Indeed the Lord’s bewitching eyes would cast their spell on the Lord Himself if only He beheld them in a mirror.




## 7.7.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஆட்டியும் தூற்றியும் நின்று அன்னைமீர் என்னை நீர்நலிந்துஎன்?  
மாட்டு உயர் கற்பகத்தின் வல்லியோ? கொழுந்தோ? அறியேன்,  
ஈட்டிய வெண்ணெய்உண்டான் திருமூக்கு எனதுஆவியுள்ளே,  
மாட்டிய வல்விளக்கின் சுடராய்நிற்கும் வாலியதே.

āṭṭiyum tūṟṟiyum niṉṟu aṉṉaimīr eṉṉai nīrnalintueṉ?  
māṭṭu uyar kaṟpakattiṉ valliyō? koḻuntō? aṟiyēṉ,  
īṭṭiya veṇṇeyuṇṭāṉ tirumūkku eṉatuāviyuḷḷē,  
māṭṭiya valviḷakkiṉ cuṭarāyniṟkum vāliyatē.

**English translation of verse 7.7.2:**

Ye, elders, there’s no use your prodding and rebuking me,  
I know not whether ‘tis the creeper or the leaf of ‘kaṟpaka’ tree.  
That does the Lord’s eyes adjoin or the nose of the One that ate  
Butter by stealth, blazing like a steady flame bright, in my heart.

**Notes:**

Now it is the Lord’s charming nose, in between the pair of lotus-eyes, that torments the Nāyakī. At first sight, it looks like a ‘Kaṟpaka’ creeper or leaf adjoining the Lord’s eyes. It is only on a closer examination, it turns out to be the Lord’s nose. The nose instantly reminds the Āḻvār of Kṛṣṇa, as a child, having eaten the stored-up butter stealthily and exposed Himself by smearing the nose with the stolen butter, a tell-tale. The Nāyakī relates that incident as if she has perceived it with her eyes; actually, even the characteristic smell of butter she appreciates now in her mental vision. The elders, therefore, asked the Nāyakī to point out to them the Lord’s nose with which she was so much obsessed, but she said it was shining forth in her heart (mind’s eye) like a flame, steady and bright, as if to torment her with a vengeance.




## 7.7.3
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வாலியதுஓர் கனிகொல் வினையாட்டியேன் வல்வினைகொல்,  
கோலம் திரள்பவளக் கொழும்துண்டம்கொலோ? அறியேன்,  
நீல நெடுமுகில்போல் திருமேனி அம்மான் தொண்டைவாய்,  
ஏலும் திசையுள்எல்லாம் வந்து தோன்றும் என்இன்உயிர்க்கே.

vāliyatuōr kaṉikol viṉaiyāṭṭiyēṉ valviṉaikol,  
kōlam tiraḷpavaḷak koḻumtuṇṭamkolō? aṟiyēṉ,  
nīla neṭumukilpōl tirumēṉi ammāṉ toṇṭaivāy,  
ēlum ticaiyuḷellām vantu tōṉṟum eṉiṉuyirkkē.

**English translation of verse 7.7.3:**

Is this a fruit unique, ever *in tact*, or is it,  
This sinner’s sin tough, that can’t enojoy it right now or is it  
A chip of coral, pretty and delicate, I know not;  
The red lips, fruit-like of the cloud-hued Lord are seen  
In every direction I turn, tormenting my life sweet.

**Notes:**

The Lord’s red lips look like a red fruit which is ever fresh and knows no growth or decay; they also look like a chip of coral. The Nāyakī recognises on a closer look that they are but the lips of the cloud-hued Lord of bluish tint, which she would like to enjoy that very moment, but can’t do so, because of her heavy sins standing in the way. The nectarean lips are indeed oppressive to the Nāyakī, in her present state of frustration, like nectar becoming a veritable poison, in so far as a sinner is concerned, precluding him from enjoying it. Surely, the Lord’s lips would not lag behind His eyes and nose, in exhibiting to the Nāyakī their oppressive charm, making themselves distinctly visible wherever she turns, determined to end her life.




## 7.7.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

இன்உயிர்க்கு ஏழையர்மேல் வளையும் இணை நீலவிற்கொல்,  
மன்னிய சீர்மதனன் கருப்புச் சிலை கொல், மதனன்  
தன்உயிர்த் தாதை கண்ணபெருமான் புருவம்அவையே,  
என்உயிர் மேலனவாய் அடுகின்றன என்றும் நின்றே

iṉuyirkku ēḻaiyarmēl vaḷaiyum iṇai nīlaviṟkol,  
maṉṉiya cīrmataṉaṉ karuppuc cilai kol, mataṉaṉ  
taṉuyirt tātai kaṇṇaperumāṉ puruvamavaiyē,  
eṉuyir mēlaṉavāy aṭukiṉṟaṉa eṉṟum niṉṟē

**English translation of verse 7.7.4:**

Well, is this a tantalising pair of bluish bows  
Whose targets are the sweet lives of poor womenfolks  
Or the amorous bow of Mataṉaṉ of undying charm,  
Or his Sire, Kaṇṇaṉ’s brows which fiercely aim  
At my life, standing quite firm?

**Notes:**

\(i\) And now, it is the turn of the Lord’s brows, well bent like a pair of bows, to torment the Nāyakī and sap her life. The proverbial bows of ‘Manmata’ (Cupid) are known to attack their natural targets, the women.

\(ii\) Lord Kṛṣṇa could be regarded as the Father of Manmata, the deity of exquisite charm, inasmuch as He begot upon Rukmiṇī, Pradyumna, extremely charming, as it were, a re-incarnation of Manmata. Kaṇṇaṉ’s brows bore such a perfect resemblance to the bows that they could be easily mistaken for each other.




## 7.7.5
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

என்றும் நின்றேதிகழும் செய்ய ஈன்சுடர் வெண்மின்னுக்கொல்,  
அன்றி என்ஆவிஅடும் அணி முத்தம்கொலோ? அறியேன்,  
குன்றம் எடுத்தபிரான் முறுவல் எனதுஆவிஅடும்  
ஒன்றும் அறிகின்றிலேன் அன்னைமீர்! எனக்கு உய்வுஇடமே

eṉṟum niṉṟētikaḻum ceyya īṉcuṭar veṇmiṉṉukkol,  
aṉṟi eṉāviaṭum aṇi muttamkolō? aṟiyēṉ,  
kuṉṟam eṭuttapirāṉ muṟuval eṉatuāviaṭum  
oṉṟum aṟikiṉṟilēṉ aṉṉaimīr! eṉakku uyvuiṭamē

**English translation of verse 7.7.5:**

I just don’t know whether it is the lightning white  
That stays and reveals the radiance red or pearls white,  
In a cluster that does my life torment; well, these smiles  
Of the Lord, Who lifted mount (Govardhan [Govardhana]) aloft, do scorch my soul,  
Oh, Elders, see I can’t how I can survive at all.

**Notes:**

The Lord’s smiles are likened to the lightning, with this difference that unlike lightning which is seem during a split second, the lightning smiles of the lord stay on and reveal the radiance of His red lips on which they keep dancing. The smiles are also likened to white pearls. The Āḻvār seems to have currently on view the smiles on Lord Kṛṣṇa’s lips when He was holding Mount Govardhana aloft. But then, there a whole township took shelter but poor Nāyakī cannot find a single spot where she can take shelter and escape from the current oppression. Speaking about the Lord’s smiles, Śrī Nampiḷḷai admirably elucidates that they dance on His lips and are thus virtually at the entrance of the lips; they should, as such, have been dealt with first and the lips thereafter. The smiles, therefore, oppress the Nāyakī, now, resenting, as it were, their relegation from the natural order.




## 7.7.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

உய்விடம் ஏழையர்க்கும் அசுரர்க்கும் அரக்கர்கட்கும்  
எவ்விடம் என்றுஇலங்கி மகரம் தழைக்கும் தளிர்கொல்,  
பைவிடப் பாம்புஅணையான் திருக்குண்டலக் காதுகளே?  
கைவிடல் ஒன்றும்இன்றி அடுகின்றன காண்மின்களே

uyviṭam ēḻaiyarkkum acurarkkum arakkarkaṭkum  
evviṭam eṉṟuilaṅki makaram taḻaikkum taḷirkol,  
paiviṭap pāmpuaṇaiyāṉ tirukkuṇṭalak kātukaḷē?  
kaiviṭal oṉṟumiṉṟi aṭukiṉṟaṉa kāṇmiṉkaḷē

**English translation of verse 7.7.6:**

Are these the leaves fish-shaped? No, these are the ears,  
Bedecked with rings, studded with pearls, of the Lord Who has  
As His bed, the hooded serpent poisonous, which finish off alike  
Womenfolks, asuras and demons and torment me with no break.

**Notes:**

The ears of the Lord leave no chance of survival for the Asuras and Rākṣasas who will die of jealousy on beholding the charming lobes, and again, the weaker sex (women) would pine for the Lord and collapse due to the non-fulfilment of their aspirations. The Āḻvār feels tormented because he could not enjoy the Lord there and then, much as he pined for such enjoyment. It is not merely the natural charm of the Lord’s ear-lobes that torments the Nāyakī but it stands heightened by the pearls worn on them and the back-drop of Ādiśeṣa on whom the Lord is reclining. So then, the poignancy of oppression from this source makes the earlier tormenters pale into insignificance, and they even appear comparatively as benefactors like charitable persons setting up booths to quench the thirst of the weary sojourners.




## 7.7.7
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

காண்மின்கள் அன்னையர்காள்! என்று காட்டும் வகைஅறியேன்,  
நாள்மன்னு வெண்திங்கள் கொல்! நயந்தார்கட்கு நச்சுஇலைகொல்,  
சேண்மன்னு நால்தடம்தோள் பெருமான்தன் திருநுதலே?,  
கோள்மன்னி ஆவிஅடும் கொடியேன் உயிர் கோள்இழைத்தே

kāṇmiṉkaḷ aṉṉaiyarkāḷ! eṉṟu kāṭṭum vakaiaṟiyēṉ,  
nāḷmaṉṉu veṇtiṅkaḷ kol! nayantārkaṭku naccuilaikol,  
cēṇmaṉṉu nāltaṭamtōḷ perumāṉtaṉ tirunutalē?,  
kōḷmaṉṉi āviaṭum koṭiyēṉ uyir kōḷiḻaittē

**English translation of verse 7.7.7:**

Whether ‘tis the waxing moon in the mid-fortnight  
Or the herb deadly unto God-lovers, say I can’t.  
Oh, Elders, how I wish I could show you what I behold!  
But I know not how it can be done, well, ‘tis the forehead  
Of the Lord with shoulders four, stout and fine  
That blisters this sinner’s soul, out to snatch my life.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The Lord’s charming forehead is now visualised by the Nāyakī. She wants to show it to the elders around but she can’t do so, it being only a mental vision confined to her. Nor can she ask them to see it because they are not similarly gifted with this vision. The Lord’s sinewy shoulders have also been mentioned in this song to identity the forehead as that of the One whose shoulders, stout and fine, enthralled the Āḻvār even as they attracted Hanumān, at first sight.

\(ii\) The Lord is indeed a delicious herb, as acknowledged by the Āḻvār himself in V-7, but He turns out to be deadly like poison, in the Nāyakī’s present state of dejection.

\(iii\) If the Lord’s charming features should turn out to be oppressive, it is because of the Āḻvār’s sins, as he put it.




## 7.7.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கோள்இழைத் தாமரையும் கொடியும் பவளமும் வில்லும்,.  
கோள்இழைத் தண் முத்தமும் தளிரும் குளிர்வான் பிறையும்,  
கோள்இழையாஉடைய கொழும்சோதி வட்டம்கொல் கண்ணன்,  
கோள்இழை வாள் முகமாய் கொடியேன் உயிர் கொள்கின்றதே?

kōḷiḻait tāmaraiyum koṭiyum pavaḷamum villum,.  
kōḷiḻait taṇ muttamum taḷirum kuḷirvāṉ piṟaiyum,  
kōḷiḻaiyāuṭaiya koḻumcōti vaṭṭamkol kaṇṇaṉ,  
kōḷiḻai vāḷ mukamāy koṭiyēṉ uyir koḷkiṉṟatē?

**English translation of verse 7.7.8:**

The eyes like unto self-decorating lotus, the creeper-like nose,  
Coral lips, leaf-like ear-lobes, brows well bent like bows,  
The radiant smiles, like unto a jewel, the moon-like forehead  
A veritable region of radiance galore, all these decorate Kaṇṇaṉ, my Lord,  
And His beaming face peeps out to sap this sinner’s life alas!

**Note**

The aggregate charm of the various limbs of the Lord, detailed in the seven preceding songs, each one of which is a decoration by itself, is reflected in Kaṇṇaṉ’s beaming face, a veritable region of radiance galore, which has, however, a devastating effect on the Saint in his present disconsolate state. If he sinks down instead of being boosted up by the glowing vision of the Lord’s superlative charm, it is because of his sins which preclude the external perception of the Lord’s charm as well.




## 7.7.9
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கொள்கின்ற கோள் இருளைச் சுகிர்ந்திட்ட கொழும் சுருளின்,  
உள்கொண்ட நீல நல் நூல் தழைகொல்? அன்று மாயன் குழல்,  
விள்கின்ற பூந்தண்துழாய் விரை நாற வந்து என் உயிரைக்,  
கள்கின்றவாறு அறியீர் அன்னைமீர்! கழறாநிற்றிரே.

koḷkiṉṟa kōḷ iruḷaic cukirntiṭṭa koḻum curuḷiṉ,  
uḷkoṇṭa nīla nal nūl taḻaikol? aṉṟu māyaṉ kuḻal,  
viḷkiṉṟa pūntaṇtuḻāy virai nāṟa vantu eṉ uyiraik,  
kaḷkiṉṟavāṟu aṟiyīr aṉṉaimīr! kaḻaṟāniṟṟirē.

**English translation of verse 7.7.9:**

Is it that pitched darkness enveloping the whole world,  
Compressed into dark-blue thread, neatly packed and rolled?  
No, these are the lovely strands of hair of my wondrous Lord  
Wafting the sweet fragrance of tuḷaci, cool and nice,  
You, elders, know not how it steals away my life  
And saying one thing or another, me you just chide.

**Note**

It is indeed a grand poetic imagery, the comparison of the peerless beauty of the Lord’s locks. If the unwholesome part of the grim darkness, that gripped the entire universe, during the great deluge, were weeded out, the rest could be compressed into nice, dark-blue rolls, like unto cotton strands from which yarn is spun. Attempting a comparison like this unto the Lord’s lovely locks, the Saint realises that comparisons, as a rule, are much-too-feeble when it is a matter of describing the Lord’s beauty galore, defying description and he would, therefore, simply call them the locks of the wondrous Lord.




## 7.7.10
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நிற்றி முற்றத்துள் என்று நெரித்த கையர் ஆய்  
என்னை நீர் சுற்றியும் சூழ்ந்தும் வைதிர் சுடர்ச் சோதி மணிநிறம்ஆய்,  
முற்ற இம்மூவுலகும் விரிகின்ற சுடர்முடிக்கே,  
ஒற்றுமை கொண்டது உள்ளம் அன்னைமீர்! நசை என் நுங்கட்கே?

niṟṟi muṟṟattuḷ eṉṟu neritta kaiyar āy  
eṉṉai nīr cuṟṟiyum cūḻntum vaitir cuṭarc cōti maṇiniṟamāy,  
muṟṟa immūvulakum virikiṉṟa cuṭarmuṭikkē,  
oṟṟumai koṇṭatu uḷḷam aṉṉaimīr! nacai eṉ nuṅkaṭkē?

**English translation of verse 7.7.10:**

Elders, You rebuke me as being forward and twist  
Your fingers, surrounding me for ever, in protest,  
But ‘tis no use your expecting me to get round,  
For immersed in the Lord’s resplendent crown is my mind.

**Note**

The Lord’s radiant crown is shedding its lustre on all the worlds and the Nāyakī’s mind stands rivetted to it. There is, therefore, no point in the elders blaming her as transgressing the feminine bounds of modesty and pulling her up all the time. On the other hand, she would expect them to take steps to hand her over to the Lord to whom she rightly belongs, having come of age for such consummation.




## 7.7.11
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கட்கு அரிய பிரமன் சிவன் இந்திரன் என்று இவர்க்கும்,  
கட்கு அரிய கண்ணனைக் குருகூர்ச் சடகோபன் சொன்ன,  
உட்கு உடை ஆயிரத்துள் இவையும் ஒரு பத்தும் வல்லார்,  
உட்கு உடை வானவரோடு உடனாய் என்றும் மாயாரே. (2)

kaṭku ariya piramaṉ civaṉ intiraṉ eṉṟu ivarkkum,  
kaṭku ariya kaṇṇaṉaik kurukūrc caṭakōpaṉ coṉṉa,  
uṭku uṭai āyirattuḷ ivaiyum oru pattum vallār,  
uṭku uṭai vāṉavarōṭu uṭaṉāy eṉṟum māyārē. (2)

**English translation of verse 7.7.11:**

Those that can recite these songs ten  
Out of the thousand composed by Kurukūr Caṭakōpaṉ,  
Presenting the picture of Lord Kaṇṇaṉ, true and graphic.  
And adoring Him, invisible to humans and exalted Devas alike,  
Will for ever remain in the company of ardent Celestials in Heaven.

**Notes**

Those that chant these ten songs don’t have to languish without enjoying Lord Kṛṣṇa’s Divine presence. They will remain in Heaven partaking of the eternal bliss of divine Service, along with the holy band of ‘Nitya Sūrīs’ inseparably. The entire hymnal of Tiruvāymoḻi depicts the Lord’s Form, attributes and wealth faithfully. There lies its merit, its great strength.

It is noteworthy that the Lord, whom even the exalted Devas like Brahmā, Śiva, Indra and others cannot easily behold, made Himself visible to the Saint wherever he turned.
