## 00 Intro2.5
The sufferings undergone by the Āḻvār, as set out in the last decad, are comparable to the titanic struggle of Gajendra, the elephant, with the crocodile. Even as the Lord rushed, with an aching heart, to the pond post-haste on hearing the alarum raised by the elephant the Lord felt exceedingly remorseful that He did not rush to meet the Āḻvār as soon as the latter became critical of His nonchalance, that is, His not rushing to his aid despite His having the mighty Garuḍa to carry Him anywhere at supersonic speed. See II-4-4. By way of making amends for this remissness, the Lord has now come to the Āḻvār, in all His splendour and paraphernalia and is at the height of His joy in the blessed company of the Saint. Beholding the joyous Lord, the Saint feels immensely delighted and relates, in this decad, his ecstatic experience.




## 2.5.1
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அம் தாமத்து அன்பு செய்து என் ஆவி சேர் அம்மானுக்கு,  
அம் தாமம் வாழ் முடி சங்கு ஆழி நூல் ஆரம் உள,  
செந்தாமரைத்தடம் கண் செங்கனி வாய் செங்கமலம்,  
செந்தாமரை அடிகள் செம்பொன் திரு உடம்பே.

am tāmattu aṉpu ceytu eṉ āvi cēr ammāṉukku,  
am tāmam vāḻ muṭi caṅku āḻi nūl āram uḷa,  
centāmaraittaṭam kaṇ ceṅkaṉi vāy ceṅkamalam,  
centāmarai aṭikaḷ cempoṉ tiru uṭampē.

**English translation of verse 2.5.1:**

The Lord stands in my soul stationed,  
Looking upon it as the lovely Heaven, wears He a pretty garland,  
The dazzling crown, conch and discus, sacred thread  
And chain; His eyes are like red lotus ponds,  
His lips and feet also like lotus red, aglow is His person like red gold.

**Notes**

\(i\) It is the Lord’s will that the Āḻvār should be kept in this abode a little longer for the benefit of humanity at large. The Āḻvār, however, aspired to enter the gatherings of the celestials in the yonder Heaven and sing the Lord’s glory profusely and for ever in their holy company. See II-3-10. As a compromise, the Lord meets the aspiration of the Āḻvār by conferring on him the heavenly bliss longed for by him right here. The Āḻvār rejoices that the Lord exhibits unto him all that love which He bears for the celestials and describes the Lord’s glowing features.

\(ii\) Tirumālai Aṇṭāṉ, referred to earlier, told Śrī Rāmānuja, while studying this song, that he had heard it said by his preceptor, yāmunācārya, that the Āḻvār rejoices in this song as the Lord has joined him along with the entire band of ‘Nityā Sūrīs’ as apired for by him. But Śrī Rāmānuja opined that this song relates how the Lord’s person, His jewels, weapons etc, all of which lacked lustre and were as good as non-existent before He mingled with the Āḻvār, now shine with extra brilliance which fascinated the Āḻvār so much.

\(ii\) Yet another version is: In that section of the Vedās, known as the ‘Antarāditya Vidyā,’ the Lord is said to shine inside the Sun, assuming a body glittering like gold, lotus-eyed, bejewelled and so on; the Lord has now entered the Āḻvār’s person with all that splendour.




## 2.5.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

திரு உடம்பு வான் சுடர் செந்தாமரை கண் கை கமலம்,  
திரு இடமே மார்வம் அயன் இடமே கொப்பூழ்,  
ஒருவு இடமும் எந்தை பெருமாற்கு அரனே ஓ,  
ஒருவு இடம் ஒன்று இன்றி என்னுள் கலந்தானுக்கே.

tiru uṭampu vāṉ cuṭar centāmarai kaṇ kai kamalam,  
tiru iṭamē mārvam ayaṉ iṭamē koppūḻ,  
oruvu iṭamum entai perumāṟku araṉē ō,  
oruvu iṭam oṉṟu iṉṟi eṉṉuḷ kalantāṉukkē.

**English translation of verse 2.5.2:**

Oh, what a wonder! the Lord who holds on His chest  
Tiru (Lakṣmī), whose navel is Brahmā’s seat while the rest  
Is by Araṉ held, has with me mingled, leaving vacant  
No space in my body; beams my Sire’s body with rare brilliance  
And aglow like the lotus red are His eyes and hands.

**Notes**

(ī) Lakṣmī, the Divine Mother, stands ensconced on the Lord’s chest; Brahmā, the demi-urge, appointed by the Lord to create all the fourteen worlds, would not budge from His navel and the rest of the Lord’s body is occupied by Araṉ (Rudra). One so great has now come and taken possession of the entire body of the Āḻvār. Thrilled by his contact with the Lord’s exquisite person, the Āḻvār describes His lustrous body. When He casts loving glances at the Āḻvār, the latter sees His lotus eyes proclaiming His overlordship (Sovereignty and Supremacy). Apprehending the frightful possibility of the Āḻvār once again resiling, overwhelmed by the Lord’s Sovereignty, the Lord catches hold of the Āḻvār by the hand. At once, the Āḻvār describes the lotus hand that gripped him.

\(ii\) While discoursing on this song, the great Preceptor, Nañcīyar feelingly remarked:

\(iii\) “The Āḻvār, who is our greatest wcḷḷ-wisher, speaks of the Lord’s body beaming with brilliance. Indeed, there is hardly a sin as heinous as denying the Lord, His form and attributes, even as there is no favour done by the Lord to us, so great as this one of our being kept outside the pale of such a heresy”.

\(iv\) It is noteworthy that it is not a mere fantastic visionary but Saint Śaṭakōpa, endowed by an Omniscient Lord with knowledge, full and complete, shorn of doubts, despair, discrepancies and deviations, (See I-1-1) that goes into raptures over the Lord’s exquisite Form. Compare also, Lord Rāma offering His body, in embrace, to Hanumān, the glorious emissary, on the latter’s return from his pioneering visit to Laṅkā, deemed by the Lord as the choicest gift. He could māke, befitting the particular context. Surely, it was not an illusory or fictitious body that the Lord palmed off as the choicest gift but one most coveted by Himself and specifically assumed by Him for the purpose of His avatāra.




## 2.5.3
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

என்னுள் கலந்தவன் செங்கனி வாய் செங்கமலம்,  
மின்னும் சுடர் மலைக்குக் கண் பாதம் கை கமலம்,  
மன்னும் முழு ஏழ் உலகும் வயிற்றின் உள,  
தன்னுள் கலவாதது எப் பொருளும் தான் இலையே.

eṉṉuḷ kalantavaṉ ceṅkaṉi vāy ceṅkamalam,  
miṉṉum cuṭar malaikkuk kaṇ pātam kai kamalam,  
maṉṉum muḻu ēḻ ulakum vayiṟṟiṉ uḷa,  
taṉṉuḷ kalavātatu ep poruḷum tāṉ ilaiyē.

**English translation of verse 2.5.3:**

The One, in me mingled, sparkles like a dazzling mount,  
Like unto the lotus red are His mouth, eyes, feet and hands,  
His stomach does all the worlds seven sustain,  
There’s scarcely a thing that doesn’t in Him converge.

**Notes**

\(i\) Not only Lakṣmī, Brahmā and Rudra, but whatever exists subsists in Him alone. Even so, it is now made to appear that the Lord cannot subsist except by mingling with the Āḻvār. who has, in this context, given Him yet another name (like Nārāyaṇa Vāsudēva) namely, ‘The one iṇ me mingled’.

\(ii\) The Lord is in full bloom and joy only after He mingled with the Āḻvār and has acquired stability like a mountain. The Lord’s resplendent person, eyes, mouth, hands and feet, all resembling red lotus, are indeed far more attractive now, than ever before, having acquired new dimensions. Little wonder then, the Āḻvār is never tired of describing the Lord’s exquisite form and His charming features, as reoriented.




## 2.5.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

எப் பொருளும் தான் ஆய் மரகதக் குன்றம் ஒக்கும்.  
அப்பொழுதைத் தாமரைப்பூக் கண் பாதம் கை கமலம்,  
எப்பொழுதும் நாள் திங்கள் ஆண்டு ஊழி ஊழிதொறும்,  
அப்பொழுதைக்கு அப்பொழுது என் ஆரா அமுதமே.

ep poruḷum tāṉ āy marakatak kuṉṟam okkum.  
appoḻutait tāmaraippūk kaṇ pātam kai kamalam,  
eppoḻutum nāḷ tiṅkaḷ āṇṭu ūḻi ūḻitoṟum,  
appoḻutaikku appoḻutu eṉ ārā amutamē.

**English translation of verse 2.5.4:**

The Lord, who in Him all things contains,  
Like unto an emerald mount shines;  
With eyes, feet and hands, like red lotus in fresh bloom,  
A non-satiate nectar unto me He is, at all times,  
Thro’ days, months, years and aeons.

**Note**

In his preamble to this song, the illustrious Nampiḷḷai says: Seeing the Āḻvār comparing repeatedly the Lord’s eyes, lips, hands and feet to red lotus, some persons asked him why he went on repeating the same thing. The Āḻvār rejoined, “Well, I cannot help saying so, for every moment, down the days, months, years and a whole epoch, there is a freshness about Him, like the lotus in fresh bloom and hence there is no room for satiety nor is there any question of an insipid repetition of something, stale and static.




## 2.5.5
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஆரா அமுதமாய் அல் ஆவியுள் கலந்த,  
கார் ஆர் கருமுகில் போல் என் அம்மான் கண்ணனுக்கு,  
நேரா வாய் செம்பவளம் கண் பாதம் கை கமலம்,  
பேர் ஆரம் நீள் முடி நாண், பின்னும் இழை பலவே.

ārā amutamāy al āviyuḷ kalanta,  
kār ār karumukil pōl eṉ ammāṉ kaṇṇaṉukku,  
nērā vāy cempavaḷam kaṇ pātam kai kamalam,  
pēr āram nīḷ muṭi nāṇ, piṉṉum iḻai palavē.

**English translation of verse 2.5.5:**

The non-satiate nectar, the cloud-hued Lord,  
Has into my worthless soul entered;  
Can the fruits red compare with the lips of Kaṇṇaṉ, my Sire;  
Or the lotus Sower match His eyes, hands and feet, ever?  
Many indeed are His jewels, the crown, tall and majestic,  
The necklace huge, waist band and all that.

**Note**

The Āḻvār who was hitherto comparing the Lord’s lips to red, fruits and His eyes, hands and feet to the red lotus flower, has now a closer look at the Lord inside him and finds that the Lord is of matchless beauty and incomparable excellence and that the things hitherto compared with Him, stand nowhere. Then the Āḻvār beholds the vast array of jewels on the Lord’s person and starts enumerating them, only to give it up as impossible. The Lord’s crown, tall and majestic, proclaims His sovereignty over the entire Universe, comprising the two Vibhū is ‘Nitya Vibhūtī’ (Eternal Land) and the ‘Līlā Vibhūti’ (Sportive Universe).




## 2.5.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

பலபலவே ஆபரணம் பேரும் பலபலவே,  
பலபலவே சோதி வடிவு பண்பு எண்ணில்,  
பலபல கண்டு உண்டு கேட்டு உற்று மோந்து இன்பம்,  
பலபலவே ஞானமும் பாம்பு அணை மேலாற்கேயோ.

palapalavē āparaṇam pērum palapalavē,  
palapalavē cōti vaṭivu paṇpu eṇṇil,  
palapala kaṇṭu uṇṭu kēṭṭu uṟṟu mōntu iṉpam,  
palapalavē ñāṉamum pāmpu aṇai mēlāṟkēyō.

**English translation of verse 2.5.6:**

The Lord who on serpent bed reclines,  
(Has acquired inside me dimensions new);  
Were I to pause and examine His union  
With me, an endless variety unto me He unravels,  
Of jewels, Forms exquisite and how in me He revels  
Thro’ the sensual channels many with appropriate Know-how.

**Notes**

\(i\) The Āḻvār feels that the Lord, in union with him, is not satisfied with His assumption of a single form, a single set of jewels, a single method of enjoyment of the Āḻvār through the senses of seeing, smelling etc, or single type of knowledge bin wants to enjoy the Āḻvār in myriad ways, employing different techniques, assuming different forms, displaying different sets of jewels, so on and so forth.

\(ii\) As Nampiḷḷai puts it, the Lord wants to enjoy the Āḻvār, assuming many forms, as Sage Śaubhari did, with regard to his umpteen wives. The Lord exhibits the same ardour iṇ His enjoyment of the Āḻvār as the emancipated soul does, on reaching Heaven, for enjoying the Lord.




## 2.5.7
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

பாம்பு அணைமேல் பாற்கடலுள் பள்ளி அமர்ந்ததுவும்,  
காம்பு அணை தோள் பின்னைக்கு ஆய் ஏறு உடன் ஏழ் செற்றதுவும்,  
தேம் பணைய சோலை மராமரம் ஏழ் எய்ததுவும்,  
பூம் பிணைய தண் துழாய்ப் பொன் முடி அம் போர் ஏறே.

pāmpu aṇaimēl pāṟkaṭaluḷ paḷḷi amarntatuvum,  
kāmpu aṇai tōḷ piṉṉaikku āy ēṟu uṭaṉ ēḻ ceṟṟatuvum,  
tēm paṇaiya cōlai marāmaram ēḻ eytatuvum,  
pūm piṇaiya taṇ tuḻāyp poṉ muṭi am pōr ēṟē.

**English translation of verse 2.5.7:**

Trim and lovely, like the martial bull, my Lord,  
Sporting the gold crown and the tulacī garland.  
Cool and well-knit, on the serpent-bed reclined  
In the milk-ocean, tamed all at once the bulls seven  
For the sake of Piṉṉai of shoulders fine and pierced the trees seven.

**Notes**

\(i\) In terms of the new technique adopted by the Lord, as set out in the previcus song, the Lord exhibited a few of the wondrous deeds performed by Him long back and the Āḻvār records them here, as envisioned by him.

\(ii\) According to one tradition, Nappiṇṇai, the charming shepherdess, believed to be an incarnation of Goddess Nīlā Devī, was a niece of Yaśodhā. Her father had set up a precondition for any one seeking her hand, namely, the taming of seven unruly bulk, all at once. Śrī Kṛṣṇa’ assumed seven different forms, tackled these bulls effectively and tamed them to win the charming bride. A Demon named Kālanēmi had been slain by the Lord in a previous Yuga. The seven sons of the demon swore vendetta against the Lord and were reborn as seven bulls, determined to kill Śrī Kṛṣṇa.




## 2.5.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

பொன் முடி அம் போர் ஏற்றை எம்மானை நால் தடம் தோள்,  
தன் முடிவு ஒன்று இல்லாத தண் துழாய் மாலையனை,  
என் முடிவு காணாதே என்னுள் கலந்தானை,  
சொல்முடிவு காணேன் நான் சொல்லுவது என் சொல்லீரே.

poṉ muṭi am pōr ēṟṟai emmāṉai nāl taṭam tōḷ,  
taṉ muṭivu oṉṟu illāta taṇ tuḻāy mālaiyaṉai,  
eṉ muṭivu kāṇātē eṉṉuḷ kalantāṉai,  
colmuṭivu kāṇēṉ nāṉ colluvatu eṉ collīrē.

**English translation of verse 2.5.8:**

Majestic like the warring bull is my Lord,  
Sporting the gold cown [crown?], of sinewy shoulders four,  
Of limitless glory, wearing the cool tulacī garland;  
Mingled He with me, not minding my status poor,  
Falter do 1 as I attempt to sing His glory interminable,  
Better tell me how to laud (my Lord), ye worldlings voluble!

**Notes**

\(i\) The Āḻvār says that it is beyond his capacity to describe the condescending love of One, so great, mingling with him, so low.

\(ii\) The Lord’s crown and tulacī garland proclaim His sovereignty. If His glory is limitless, there is also no limit to the Āḻvār’s abjectness and yet He has chosen to mingle with the Āḻvār. By His deeds and traits, the Lord enthralled the Āḻvār who, however, finds that words are not adequate to describe his experience.. On the other hand, the worldlings revel in their own spheres and wax eloquent. The Āḻvār turns round and asks them how they could freely indulge in all that rhetoric, when he himself suffered from tardiness of expression, overawed.




## 2.5.9
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

சொல்லீர் என் அம்மானை என் ஆவி ஆவிதனை,  
எல்லை இல் சீ ர் என் கருமாணிக்கச் சுடரை,  
நல்ல அமுதம் பெறற்கு அரிய வீடும் ஆய்,  
அல்லி மலர் விரை ஒத்து ஆண் அல்லன் பெண் அலனே.

collīr eṉ ammāṉai eṉ āvi āvitaṉai,  
ellai il cī r eṉ karumāṇikkac cuṭarai,  
nalla amutam peṟaṟku ariya vīṭum āy,  
alli malar virai ottu āṇ allaṉ peṇ alaṉē.

**English translation of verse 2.5.9:**

Better sing the praise of my Sire,  
The Soul of my soul, the lustrous sapphire,  
Of auspicious qualities endless, the delectable nectar,  
The Ordainer great of ‘Mokṣa’, difficult to attain,  
Sweet like the fragrance of the lotus flower,  
Neither the male nor the female we know of.

**Notes**

\(i\) Although the Āḻvār found himself speechless, yet he could not resist the urge to sing the Lord’s praise, in the company of the worldlings. And, therefore, he exhorts them to desist from the worldly affairs, at least for a while, and sing the Lord’s glory along with him.

\(ii\) Being a ‘Puruṣa’ (Male), the Lord is certainly not a female and being a ‘Puruṣottama’ (gem of a male), He is very different from the other males, we know of. That is why it has been said here that He is neither the male nor the female *of the known variety*.




## 2.5.10
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஆண் அல்லன் பெண் அல்லன் அல்லா அலியும் அல்லன்,  
காணலும் ஆகான் உளன் அல்லன் இல்லை அல்லன்,  
பேணுங்கால் பேணும் உரு ஆகும் அல்லனும் ஆம்,  
கோணை பெரிது உடைத்து எம் பெம்மானைக் கூறுதலே.

āṇ allaṉ peṇ allaṉ allā aliyum allaṉ,  
kāṇalum ākāṉ uḷaṉ allaṉ illai allaṉ,  
pēṇuṅkāl pēṇum uru ākum allaṉum ām,  
kōṇai peritu uṭaittu em pemmāṉaik kūṟutalē.

**English translation of verse 2.5.10:**

‘Tis indeed very difficult to sing precisely, my Lord’s glory  
Neither male nor female is He nor the eunuch neutral,  
He exists not, nor does He not exist;  
Him the naked eye can’t see and yet He assumes  
The form the devout desire while unto others He is just inaccessible.

**Note**

In Ṛg Veda, ‘Āraṇyaka’, the Lord is said, to be quite apart, that is, different from the rest. Therefore it is, the Āḻvār says that He is neither male nor female, nor the ‘in-between’. A Tamil Pundit, who was listening to Śrī Parāśara Bhaṭṭar’s discourse on this song, observed that it smacked of the doctrine of nothingness (Śūnya), as the Lord could not be brought under any of the three known categories of beings. But the learned discourser pointed out that, in this song, the Lord has not been referred to, in the neuter gender but described only in the masculine gender, as a male, who is, however, very different from other males and hence not the male, we know of.




## 2.5.11
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கூறுதல் ஒன்று ஆராக் குடக் கூத்த அம்மானைக்,  
கூறுதலே மேவிக் குருகூர்ச் சடகோபன்,  
கூறின அந்தாதி ஓர் ஆயிரத்துள் இப் பத்தும்  
கூறுதல் வல்லார் உளரேல் கூடுவர் வைகுந்தமே.

kūṟutal oṉṟu ārāk kuṭak kūtta ammāṉaik,  
kūṟutalē mēvik kurukūrc caṭakōpaṉ,  
kūṟiṉa antāti ōr āyirattuḷ ip pattum  
kūṟutal vallār uḷarēl kūṭuvar vaikuntamē.

**English translation of verse 2.5.11:**

Those that can recite these stanzas ten,  
Out of the thousand sung by Kurukūr Caṭakōpaṉ,  
Keen to recount the traits, beyond description.  
Of (Lord Kṛṣṇa), the great pot-dancer, will the high heaven attain.

**Notes**

\(i\) Those, conversant with this decad, will attain Heaven without undergoing any of the sufferings, passed through by the Āḻvār as set out in the last decad. It is like the sons enjoying, with ease, the property acquired by the father, by dint of hard labour and sufferings.

\(ii\) It is not the Lord’s transcendental glory that baffles description but His easy accessibility and wondrous deeds like pot-dancing etc., during His Avatāras Lord Kṛṣṇa. If, however, the Āḻvār could manage to talk about the Lord’s ‘Saulabhya’ or simplicity galore, it is indeed the victory of his faith, his deep love for God, infused in him by the Lord Himself.
