## 00 Intro7.1
In Bhagavad Gītā (7-14), the Lord stated that those who take refuge in Him alone can get beyond Māyā (Prakṛti). Then and then only, the ‘Prakṛti’ helps towards liberation instead of hindering by concealing the real nature of the Lord. The net woven around each individual soul by the Almighty Lord, in the light of past Karma, has to be disentangled by Him alone, seeing that we are much-too-feeble and cannot disentangle even the nest built by a frail bird, in the manner it does. Only He can undo this bondage of ours, when we clasp His holy feet as the Sole Saviour. It was against this background that the Āḻvār sought refuge at the feet of the Lord at Tiruvēṅkaṭam in VI-10-10. But then, it didn’t yield the desired result immediately. Why was it so?

Who indeed can question the love and integrity of Bharata who did ‘Prapatti’ (surrender) unto Śrī Rāma, begging of Him to get back to Ayodhyā and take up the reins of the Kingdom? Why did Bharat’s surrender not meet with quick response? Well, the Ṛṣis of Daṇḍakāraṇya had surrendered unto Rāma earlier and He had promised them succour from the depredations of the Rākṣasas. Bound by this earlier commitment, Śrī Rāma could not obviously comply with Bharata’s request. Even so, some would appear to have surrendered unto the Lord prior to the point of time at which the Āḻvār did ‘Prapatti’, praying that they be blest with hymns *par excellence* for their uplift. As a matter of fact, the clue to this kind of inference can be had in X-7-5 which indicates the root-cause for the emergence of Tiruvāymoḻi, as such. That crucial stanza brings out: The sages met at a conclave and decided that they should pray unto the Lord for the birth of a work of this kind, which will do adequate justice in bringing out the Lord’s inherent nature, form, attributes, wealth and deeds. This was again due to the fact that they found the Sanskrit Vedantās (upaniṣads), meant to expatiate on the Lord’s greatness and grandeur, lagging far behind and retreating, admitting defeat—‘yato vāco nivartante’. The Lord Himself sang the Tiruvāymoḻi through Saint Nammāḻvār as His mouthpiece. Once Tiruvāymoḻi came into being, the sages found it had done full Justice to their cherished objectives and fully covered the various facets of the Lord, enumerated above, with the result that they very much wished that the Lord had still more attributes, treasures etc., so that they can have another work of such excellence, a complete reversal of their attitude towards the Upaniṣads.

And so, it is clear that the Lord deliberately delayed the consummation of the Āḻvār’s ‘Prapatti’ so as to get all the 1102 hymns from his sweet lips, the full length of this splendid treatise which would have otherwise remained truncated.

In this decad, the Āḻvār follows up the trend of thought as in VI-9-9 where he dreaded the mischief of the senses and the frightful possibility of his going astray in the event of the prolongation of his stay in this abode. It might, however, be questioned why the Āḻvār, who was well beyond the mischief of the senses, having taken a deep plunge into the ocean of divine consciousness, should dread in this manner. For this, the Āḻvār has himself provided the answer. This land is notorious for its corrupting influence, bringing within its dirty pale even the ‘Nitya Sūrīs’, the Attendants in close proximity to the Lord in Heaven, should they ever happen to come on to this soil. Further, when a person sees the houses ail around, on fire, he has got to apprehend the danger of his own house catching fire and safeguard it. A rope lying by the side of an anti-hill, the hide-out of serpents, is easily mistaken for a serpent. So also, the Āḻvār possessing a body like unto that of the worldlings, grows apprehensive about himself, finding those other persons dominated by the wayward senses.

**English translation of verse 7.1.1:**

Oh, my nectarean Lord, Benefactor great, adored by Celestials,  
Māyā (Matter) of dimensions unlimited You have at Your disposal,  
My Sire, Master of all the worlds, do You intend this vassal  
To be tormented by the senses five within, still,  
So that I attain not Your lotus feet lovely?

### Notes

\(i\) The Āḻvār questions the propriety of his being made a prey to the senses haunting him from within, by being kept still in this body by the Lord. Unlike the external enemies who are quite visible and inflict injuries through weapons etc., the five senses, constituting the hidden enemies, torment the individual souls in ever so many ways, a very pathetic and intolerable situation indeed. But then, why should the Āḻvār blame the Lord for this?

\(ii\) Of the numerous names borne by the Lord, ‘Hṛṣīkeśa’ is one; He is the Controller of the senses (Hṛṣīkam), Ṛṣi Udaṅka approached Lord Kṛṣṇa and queried him thus: “Both kurus and Pāṇḍus are equal to Thee, oh, Lord, and yet, you have caused the destruction of the former while the treatment of the latter has been quite the opposite. How can you be partial?” Lord Kṛṣṇa adduced many a reason for His preference for one party as against the other and ended by pointing out to the sage that Duryodhana and his party were found obstinately averse to all righteousness, despite His indefatigable efforts to turn them from their evil ways, the Kurus had a perversity of will which would not listen to any persuasion and so on. The Ṛṣi, however, coolly retaliated, “But, my Lord, You could certainly have predisposed them also for righteousness”.

\(iii\) The Āḻvār is indeed frightfully agitated as to why he should be kept in this body, exposed to the vagaries of the unruly senses, even after his taking refuge at the feet of the Lord. A learned dissertation on the why and wherefore of this posture can be found in ‘Śrīvacana Bhūṣaṇam’ where the illustrious Piḷḷailōkācārya has admirably elucidated, as follows:

The ‘Prapanna’, that is, a person who has surrendered himself to the loving grace and protection of the Lord, passes time in this world, between revelling in the glory of God and His devotees and contemplation of his own short-comings. Contemplation of his short-comings incites fear of the dreadful possibility of prolongation of the cycle of births and rebirths but the antidote for this lies in recounting the Lord’s auspicious qualities of love, mercy, etc., which at once dispels such fears. If, on the other hand, he thought in terms of his own spiritual equipment and advancement as sure hopes for his salvation and tried thereby to get over the fear in question, it would indeed be a case of virtue defeating itself, a self-defeating virtue clouded by conceit. Even as Saint Nammāḻvār has complained in this song, Saint Tirumaṅkai Āḻvār feels terribly panicky about the forbidding prospect of the Lord still condemning him to life inside the mother’s womb and, on this account, feels insecure like the tree standing on the fringe of a river, which could be uprooted any moment by floods. This fear and the resultant reproach from these Āḻvārs, however, stem from their intimate bonds with the Lord Whom they regard as their Sole Sustainer. This is just like the child playing in the streets, sustaining an injury at play, rushing home, crying and beating the mother for her apparent slackness in preventing the injury. Apart from their eternal and inviolable bond of relationship, the Lord is Omnipotent and could easily wipe off the malaise of His subjects. And now, considering the relationship between the creatures and the Creator as between children and Mother, it would appear as if God stands responsible for everything that befalls the creatures. For instance, if a child fell into a well, they would hold the mother as blameworthy for her failure to keep a watchful eye on the child and prevent the occurrence. Had she not permitted the child to walk up to the edge of the well, the child would not have fallen into the well.

If non-removal of the child from the vicinity of the well could be construed as permission granted for its stay there, it might as well be argued that it is the same permissive attitude of the Lord that is responsible for the individual straying away from the Lord and getting bogged down in the difficult terrain of’ Saṃsāra Well, this is not the case. Even as the consent of the Individual to submit himself to the Lord’s protection is not the cause of the benevolent protection eventually extended by the Lord and it is His own redemptive grace that matters, permission granted by the Lord for the individual’s stay in ‘Saṃsāra’ is not responsible for the latter’s downward trend. Actually, it is the Lord’s command that the subjects should conform to the dictates of the Śāstras and work their way up to Him. It is, therefore, but natural that He expects the subjects to show due regard to the Śāstraic decree and injunctions and develop love for Him. In the final analysis however, it turns out that the subjects get stranded over here, enjoying the fruits of their own ‘Karma’ and it is only the Lord’s spontaneous grace that pulls them out of the morass.

\(iv\) As stated in para 3, above, recounting the Lord’s auspicious qualities of love, mercy etc. dispels one’s fears. It is worth noting that in every song in this decad the Āḻvār cries forth his fears in the first two lines (*as per original text*), while he dwells upon the Lord’s glory and grandeur in the next two lines. As Piḷḷai Tirunarayūr Aṟaiyar put it, the first two lines of each song in this decad are like the outbursts of a child right from the mouth of a tiger facing the Mother in front (In the English rendering of the songs the position is, however, reversed).




## 7.1.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

என்னை ஆளும் வன் கோ ஓர் ஐந்து இவை பெய்து இராப்பகல் மோதுவித்திட்டு,  
உன்னை நான் அணுகாவகை செய்து போதிகண்டாய்,  
கன்னலே! அமுதே! கார் முகில் வண்ணனே! கடல் ஞாலம் காக்கின்ற  
மின்னு நேமியினாய்! வினையேனுடை வேதியனே!

eṉṉai āḷum vaṉ kō ōr aintu ivai peytu irāppakal mōtuvittiṭṭu,  
uṉṉai nāṉ aṇukāvakai ceytu pōtikaṇṭāy,  
kaṉṉalē! amutē! kār mukil vaṇṇaṉē! kaṭal ñālam kākkiṉṟa  
miṉṉu nēmiyiṉāy! viṉaiyēṉuṭai vētiyaṉē!

**English translation of verse 7.1.2:**

My most delicious Nectar, Oh, cloud-hued Lord, You wield  
The radiant discus which does the ocean-bound worlds shield  
Well beyond this sinner’s reach, You are by Vedas comprehended,  
Me You have consigned to the senses five and their cruel sway  
Day and night, and thus from You have kept me away.

**Notes:**

\(i\) *Āḻvār to the Lord*: My Lord, why should You at all endow me with the refractory senses, which upset the natural order of things and hold me in their cruel grip, day and night? You are so far away that I can’t even cry out my woes to you. The natural order of things would be: The individual soul is the vassal of the Lord, the mind is subordinate to the individual and the senses are under the immediate control of the mind, the overall control of the mind and the senses vesting in the Individual. But what is the position now? It is the bottom-most member of the hierarchy that keeps the top-most under its heels!

\(ii\) *Lord to the Āḻvār*: Oh, Āḻvār, Why do you despise these ancillaries which can be harnessed to the best possible use? The ears can listen to discourses on Me, the tongue can sing My praise, the eyes can behold Me and My devotees, the nostrils can enjoy the sweet odour of the sacred basil (tuḻaci) offered to Me and the body can get locked in My sweet embrace.

\(iii\) *Āḻvār to the Lord*: If the senses can subserve me in the manner outlined by You, I would certainly love them most. But, it is the other way round and they only distract me from my single-minded devotion unto You and hence my complaint about my continued stay in this explosive setting. It is like Your presenting the fakedeer before Sītā and putting her into the hands of the seven hundred odd Rākṣasīs in Laṅkā, who teased and tormented her.

\(iv\) *Lord to the Āḻvār*: In the untoward contingency of the senses overpowering you, better let me know so that I do apply the necessary remedies.

\(v\) *Āḻvār to the Lord*: But then, my Lord, You are quite out of hand and I am not in a position to lodge my complaint. Had You not unravelled unto me Your glorious Form, I would jolly well like to be in the company of the senses unmindful of You. But now, I just dread every moment the mischief of the senses which might lead me astray. And You keep Yourself away, out of sight, as if You have to be comprehended only through the Vedas instead of my enjoying You through direct perception!




## 7.1.3
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வேதியாநிற்கும் ஐவரால் வினையேனை மோதுவித்து உன் திருவடிச்  
சாதியாவகை நீ தடுத்து என் பெறுதிஅந்தோ,  
ஆதி ஆகி அகல் இடம் படைத்து உண்டு உமிழ்ந்து கடந்து இடந்திட்ட-  
சோதி நீள் முடியாய்! தொண்டனேன் மதுசூதனனே!

vētiyāniṟkum aivarāl viṉaiyēṉai mōtuvittu uṉ tiruvaṭic  
cātiyāvakai nī taṭuttu eṉ peṟutiantō,  
āti āki akal iṭam paṭaittu uṇṭu umiḻntu kaṭantu iṭantiṭṭa-  
cōti nīḷ muṭiyāy! toṇṭaṉēṉ matucūtaṉaṉē!

**English translation of verse 7.1.3:**

Oh Lord, sporting the long crown radiant, the worlds You did create  
And gulped them down during deluge and later spat out,  
You spanned them once and again, from deep waters, pulled out;  
Oh, Slayer of Matu, You did enthral me but then, shut me out  
From Your lovely feet, flocking me against the senses with no respite,  
Alas! this sinner knows not how, by this, You do profit.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The Scriptures enjoin that the Brahmins should tend the ritualistic (sacramental) fire throughout life and stipulate the morning and the evening as the periods during which it should be done. The Āḻvār, however, yearned to serve the Lord all his life without any intermission whatever. But what is happening? He is cruelly dominated by the wayward senses without break.

\(ii\) The wondrous deeds of the Lord, mentioned in this song reveal Him as the Benign Sustainer, but the question now is, why He does not play the same beneficent role, in the case of the Āḻvār also, without keeping him under the terrific clutches of the malignant senses.




## 7.1.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

சூது நான் அறியாவகை சுழற்றி ஓர் ஐவரைக் காட்டி உன் அடிப்போது-  
நான் அணுகாவகை செய்து போதிகண்டாய்,  
யாதும் யாவரும் இன்றி நின் அகம்பால் ஒடுக்கி ஓர் ஆலின் நீள் இலை,  
மீது சேர் குழவி! வினையேன் வினைதீர் மருந்தே!

cūtu nāṉ aṟiyāvakai cuḻaṟṟi ōr aivaraik kāṭṭi uṉ aṭippōtu-  
nāṉ aṇukāvakai ceytu pōtikaṇṭāy,  
yātum yāvarum iṉṟi niṉ akampāl oṭukki ōr āliṉ nīḷ ilai,  
mītu cēr kuḻavi! viṉaiyēṉ viṉaitīr maruntē!

**English translation of verse 7.1.4:**

As a mere Babe, You lay on a tender, fig-leaf, oh, Lord,  
And did in a corner of Your stomach all things and beings hold;  
You are the drug that cures the ills of this sinner  
And yet confounding me, You did put me into the snare;  
Of the senses five, on the sly, keeping me very far  
From Your lotus feet, invisible and far off that You are.

**Notes:**

The Āḻvār bitterly complains that:

\(i\) The Lord, who had weaned him away from the mischief of the senses and cured him of all his sins, has now exposed him to the serious risk of slipping back to his old ways;

\(ii\) The Lord has bewildered the Āḻvār who was looking upon His feet as the Sole Refuge, by bringing him once again under the cruel spell of the five senses and

\(iii\) The Lord has kept aloof from him, lest He should have to shed His grace on him, in case He stood beside him; as a matter of fact, he would have put up with any amount of torture by the senses, if only the Lord could be visualised by him, all the time.




## 7.1.5
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

தீர் மருந்து இன்றி ஐந்து நோய் அடும் செக்கில் இட்டுத் திரிக்கும் ஐவரை,  
நேர் மருங்கு உடைத்தா அடைத்து நெகிழ்ப்பான் ஒக்கின்றாய்,  
ஆர் மருந்து இனி ஆகுவார்? அடல் ஆழி ஏந்தி அசுரர் வன் குலம்,  
வேர் மருங்கு அறுத்தாய்! விண்ணுளார் பெருமானே? ஓ!

tīr maruntu iṉṟi aintu nōy aṭum cekkil iṭṭut tirikkum aivarai,  
nēr maruṅku uṭaittā aṭaittu nekiḻppāṉ okkiṉṟāy,  
ār maruntu iṉi ākuvār? aṭal āḻi ēnti acurar vaṉ kulam,  
vēr maruṅku aṟuttāy! viṇṇuḷār perumāṉē? ō!

**English translation of verse 7.1.5:**

Oh, Lord of Celestials, You have cut out, root and branch,  
The mighty hordes of Acurar, with Your discus radiant;  
Into the grinding mill where the sense-organs will crunch  
Me under the impact of the senses five, with no way out,  
You have pushed me, it looks as if your hold on me  
You are loosening. Who indeed will hereafter my elixir be?

**Notes:**

\(i\) The grinding mill is the human body where the five senses are ever active with the relative activities and their ramifications leaving no chance for the soul to thrive, crushing it beyond recognition and making redemption impossible, even by the omnipotent Lord. By putting it down as an incurable state of affairs, the Āḻvār only stresses the severity of the impact of the senses, like unto the young warrior (Abhimanyu, the great hero of Mahābhārata) caught up inextricably in the enemy camp amidst doyens and super-doyens of warfare.

\(ii\) If the Lord, who is at once the Drug and the Doctor, gave up the subject, could there be any cure for the malady? How could any one survive without that infallible medicine, the Lord? That is why the text of the song is “*Who* shall be my elixir?” instead of “*What* shall be my life-saving drug?”; the drug being an inanimate substance, is usually referred to in the neuter gender.

\(iii\) The Āḻvār’s address to the Lord as the Chief of the Celestials is meant to stir up the feelings of the Celestials in that glorious setting of unalloyed bliss and draw their attention to his own critical condition down below. This is like unto the wailing of Sītā, during her captivity in Laṅkā.




## 7.1.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

விண்ணுளார் பெருமாற்கு அடிமை செய்வாரையும் செறும் ஐம்புலன் இவை,  
மண்ணுள் என்னைப் பெற்றால் என் செய்யா மற்று நீயும் விட்டால்?  
பண்ணுளாய் கவி தன்னுளாய்! பத்தியின் உள்ளாய்! பரமீசனே, வந்து என்-  
கண்ணுளாய்! நெஞ்சுளாய்! சொல்லுளாய்! ஒன்று சொல்லாயே.

viṇṇuḷār perumāṟku aṭimai ceyvāraiyum ceṟum aimpulaṉ ivai,  
maṇṇuḷ eṉṉaip peṟṟāl eṉ ceyyā maṟṟu nīyum viṭṭāl?  
paṇṇuḷāy kavi taṉṉuḷāy! pattiyiṉ uḷḷāy! paramīcaṉē, vantu eṉ-  
kaṇṇuḷāy! neñcuḷāy! colluḷāy! oṉṟu collāyē.

**English translation of verse 7.1.6:**

Oh, Supreme Lord, my yearning, its depth and voice You know,  
Reside You do in my eyes and mind and the word I utter,  
Can’t You unto me come and a word of comfort utter?  
The senses five will taint even the Celestials, in Your service aglow.  
Should they this soil touch; what is it these won’t do  
In regard to poor me if I am given up by You too?

**Note**

Even exalted persons, in the upper regions, including the high Heavens are not above the mischief of the senses. That being so, the Āḻvār’s fears are indeed well-founded, the more so, when he stays in this physical body and in this land of dark nescience. To cite but a few instances of the havoc played by the senses on noted personages, let us take first, Indra, the Chief of the Devas. Among the many atrocities committed by the formidable Narakāsura from his abode in Prākjyōtiṣa on Earth, was the snatching of the precious earrings of Aditi, Indra’s mother. At Indra’s request, Lord Kṛṣṇa slew the demon and went to Indra’s citadel along with queen Satyabhāmā, mounted on Garuḍa to restore the ear-rings to the venerable lady. The conceited and ungrateful Indrāṇi, Indra’s consort, however, thought Satyabhāmā, a mere human, living on Earth down below, unworthy of being offered the Pārijātha flower, grown exclusively in Devalokā for the exclusive use of the women-folk there. This only excited the curiosity of the distinguished visitor who managed to have the very tree uprooted by Lord Kṛṣṇa from Indrā’s garden. As the divine couple were flying back to Earth on Garuḍa along with the tree in question, Indrāṇi got scent of it and at her instance, Indra, along with his soldiers, intercepted and fought a pitched battle with Lord Kṛṣṇa. The Lord made them bite the dust, resumed His flight to Earth and planted the tree in Sathyabhāmā’s garden. What a disgraceful behaviour of Indra, consumed by conceit going to war with his great Benefactor, right on the heels of the help received from Him!

And then, did Garuḍa, adorning the glorious rank of ‘Nitya Sūrīs’ in Heaven, fare any better? Sumukha, the serpent, when hotly pursued by Garuḍa, took refuge at the feet of Lord Kṛṣṇa. When Garuḍa requested the Lord to part with the serpent, He declined to do so and, on the top of that, entrusted the serpent to Garuḍa’s safe keeping. The mentally upset Garuḍa had then the cheek to tell the Lord: “Well, You have snatched my very food from me. Is it for this that, I have been lifting you and your consorts on my back, all these days?” On another occasion, Garuḍa took pride in his immense strength and boastfully enquired of the Lord whether there was indeed any one more powerful than he, who could carry effortlessly, at the tip of his plumes, the Omnipotent Lord and His consorts. The Lord chided the presumptuous Garuḍa and disclosed to him that all the three worlds put together can hardly bear His weight and that the truth of the matter is that He supports Himself and Garuḍa who was supposed to carry Him and His consorts. So saying, He placed just one arm on Garuḍa’s shoulder and asked him if he could sustain it. Poor Garuḍa fell down fainting, unable to bear the weight of a single arm of the Lord.

Sugrīva, the monkey-king abused the kindness of Śrī Rāma and just lost count of time, immersed in the pleasures of wine and women. And then, a sage of the eminence of Viswamitra fell an easy prey to the meretricious charms of Menaka and had a rapport with her for ten long years till he got jolted back to normal thinking.

The Supreme Lord, who holds sway all over and who can’t but hear the Āḻvār’s heart-rending appeal and note the depth of feeling behind it, is nevertheless holding Himself back and it is indeed a matter of deep regret for the Āḻvār.




## 7.1.7
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஒன்று சொல்லி ஒருத்தினில் நிற்கிலாத ஓர் ஐவர் வன் கயவரை,  
என்று யான் வெல்கிற்பன் உன் திருவருள் இல்லையேல்?,  
அன்று தேவர் அசுரர் வாங்க அலைகடல் அரவம் அளாவி, ஓர்

aṉṟu tēvar acurar vāṅka alaikaṭal aravam aḷāvi, ōr  
kuṉṟam vaitta entāy! koṭiyēṉ paruku iṉ amutē!

**English translation of verse 7.1.7:**

My Lord, You are the Nectar grand, by this sinners drunk,  
The mountain huge You once planted in surging waters  
And made the Devas and Asuras churn it with a serpent;  
But for Your sweet grace how can I the senses conquer,  
Notoriously fickle, not sticking to one thing or the other?

**Notes:**

\(i\) The churning episode reveals the extent? to which the Lord would go to help His devotees in multifarious roles, and yet, if He does not go to the rescue of the Āḻvār, how can he at all get the better of the notoriously fickle senses?

\(ii\) *The Nectar grand, drunk by this sinner*: Far from being satisfied with the interior bliss with which the Lord has endowed him in super-abundance, the Āḻvār complains that this is not supplemented by external perception and experiences. Conscious of his ingratitude in not acknowledging the many favours already heaped on him by the Lord but running into a complaining mood, the Āḻvār calls himself a sinner.




## 7.1.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

இன் அமுது எனத் தோன்றி ஓர் ஐவர் யாவரையும் மயக்க, நீ வைத்த-  
முன்னம் மாயம் எல்லாம் முழு வேர் அரிந்து என்னை உன்-  
சின்னமும் திரு மூர்த்தியும் சிந்தித்து ஏத்திக் கைதொழவே அருள் எனக்கு,  
என் அம்மா! என் கண்ணா! இமையோர் தம் குலமுதலே !

ciṉṉamum tiru mūrttiyum cintittu ēttik kaitoḻavē aruḷ eṉakku,  
eṉ ammā! eṉ kaṇṇā! imaiyōr tam kulamutalē !

**English translation of verse 7.1.8:**

Kaṇṇā, my Lord, Chief of Celestials, Your grace I invoke  
To cut out, root and branch, my age-long yoke  
Unto Saṃsāra, the senses five under the garb of pleasures nectarean,  
Which cast their spell on one and all just your creation  
And fix my mind on your insignia (the conch and discus fine)  
Your Form exquisite, sing your glory and worship you, all the time.

**Note**

The sensual pleasures of sound, sight, smell, touch and taste, assume the garb of happiness, to begin with and eventually throw the participants into the abyss of endless miseries. Hence, the request of the Āḻvār that he be studiously kept beyond their mischief so that he may constantly meditate on the Lord’s exquisite Form, wondrous weapons etc, sing His glory and worship Him, thus involving himself in such exclusive participation, by word, deed and thought.




## 7.1.9
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

குலம் முதல் அடும் தீவினைக் கொடு வன் குழியினில் வீழ்க்கும் ஐவரை  
வலம் முதல் கெடுக்கும் வரமே தந்தருள்கண்டாய்,  
நிலம் முதல் இனி எவ் உலகுக்கும் நிற்பன செல்வன எனப், பொருள்-  
பல முதல் படைத்தாய்! என் கண்ணா! என் பரஞ்சுடரே!

pala mutal paṭaittāy! eṉ kaṇṇā! eṉ parañcuṭarē!

**English translation of verse 7.1.9:**

My Kaṇṇā of splendour supreme, the worlds You did create  
And their contents, still and mobile; of you do I entreat  
To dower on me robust strength to cut out, branch and root  
The senses five, breeding sins which would the entire clan uproot.

**Note**

The sins committed by the sense-buried affect generations, back and forth, c.f. Hanumān’s advice to Rāvaṇa, that one of the latter’s calibre and wisdom should desist from committing sins which shall destroy the entire race. The Āḻvār wants the Lord to dower on him the strength which will make him tougher than this tough fountain-source of all sins, so as to demolish it effectively.




## 7.1.10
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

என் பரஞ்சுடரே! என்று உன்னை அலற்றி உன் இணைத் தாமரைகட்கு,

**English translation of verse 7.1.10:**

Oh, Lord, You churned the ocean once and delivered the nectar,  
Steeped in love unto Your lotus feet, I am bound to utter  
Your sweet names, oh Splendour Supreme! but this burden (body) You did dower,  
For me to groan under its weight and the senses five do shatter  
Poor me, pulling indifferent directions, alas! I can hardly bear.

**Note**

The Alvar is puzzled how the Lord gives nectar to some and the sense-bound body to some, like unto a deadly poison. The very body, dowered by Him for God-enjoyment, has deteriorated into a facile field for the foul play of the domineering senses, each pulling in a different direction; oh, what a tragic picture, like unto a Prince standing on the road-side, wearing a head-gear for carrying load, iṅ place of his regal crown, being forced by strangers to carry their loads!




## 7.1.11
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கொண்ட மூர்த்தி ஓர் மூவராய்க் குணங்கள் படைத்து அளித்து கெடுக்கும், அப்  
புண்டரீகக் கொப்பூழ்ப் புனல் பள்ளி அப்பனுக்கே, தொண்டர்  
தொண்டர் தொண்டர் தொண்டன் சடகோபன் சொல் ஆயிரத்துள் இப்பத்தும்,  
கண்டு பாட வல்லார் வினை போம் கங்குலும் பகலே. (2)

koṇṭa mūrtti ōr mūvarāyk kuṇaṅkaḷ paṭaittu aḷittu keṭukkum, ap  
puṇṭarīkak koppūḻp puṉal paḷḷi appaṉukkē, toṇṭar  
toṇṭar toṇṭar toṇṭaṉ caṭakōpaṉ col āyirattuḷ ippattum,  
kaṇṭu pāṭa vallār viṉai pōm kaṅkulum pakalē. (2)

**English translation of verse 7.1.11:**

Gone are the sins of those who sing day and night these songs ten,  
With understanding fine, out of the thousand composed by Caṭakōpaṉ,  
The vassal of the vassals’ vassals of Lord Padmānābhaṇ [Padmānābha],  
Who, as Trinity, carries out the functions of creation, preservation and dissolution  
And who, during deluge, did on the vast expanse of water recline.

**Notes:**

\(i\) Lord Nārāyaṇa, on whose navel emerged the lotus flower on which Brahmā appeared, carries out the triple functions of creation, sustentation and dissolution, the middle one by Himself and the other two as the Internal Controller of Brahmā and Śiva.

\(ii\) The Āḻvār seeks to assuage his mental agony in talking about the senses and sensuality, by going the whole hog out in the service of the devout, like unto a parched-up soul diving fast into the deep pockets of water.
