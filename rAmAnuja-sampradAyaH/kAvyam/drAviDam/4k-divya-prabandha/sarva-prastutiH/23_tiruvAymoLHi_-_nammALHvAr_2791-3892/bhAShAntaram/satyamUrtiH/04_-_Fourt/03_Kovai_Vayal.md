## 00 Intro4.3
This decad would appear to have been appreciated in three different ways by the ‘Pūrvācāryas’ (Preceptors of yore), as indicated below:

**Notes**

\(i\) According to Empār, the Lord did not, as such, fulfil the aspiration of the Āḻvār, as set out in the preceding decad, but focussed his attention on some of His auspicious traits enjoying which the Āḻvār remains oblivious of his erstwhile longing. This is like the baby crying for the Moon being appeased by a substitute, say, a Coconut.

\(ii\) Tirumalai Nampi would have it that the Āḻvār could be placated by a mere assurance from the Lord to fulfil his aspiration. According to this preceptor, the Lord would seem to have told the Āḻvār to his face that his aspiration would be duly met and this assurance was enough to make the Āḻvār forget his erstwhile misery and exult as in this decad.

\(iii\) Śrī Parāśara Bhaṭṭar does not seem to have been satisfied with such half-hearted compliance by the Lord. Time being at the beck and call of the Supreme Lord, He could certainly meet the demand of the Āḻvār and regale him. It is a fully satisfied Āḻvār who, according to Bhaṭṭarya, gives expression to the resultant joy in this decad.




## 4.3.1
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கோவை வாயாள் பொருட்டு ஏற்றின் எருத்தம் இறுத்தாய், மதிள் இலங்கைக்  
கோவை வீயச் சிலை குனித்தாய்! குல நல் யானை மருப்பு ஒசித்தாய்,  
பூவை வீயா நீர் தூவிப் போதால் வணங்கேனேலும், நின்  
பூவை வீயாம் மேனிக்குப் பூசும் சாந்து என் நெஞ்சமே.

kōvai vāyāḷ poruṭṭu ēṟṟiṉ eruttam iṟuttāy, matiḷ ilaṅkaik  
kōvai vīyac cilai kuṉittāy! kula nal yāṉai maruppu ocittāy,  
pūvai vīyā nīr tūvip pōtāl vaṇaṅkēṉēlum, niṉ  
pūvai vīyām mēṉikkup pūcum cāntu eṉ neñcamē.

**English translation of verse 4.3.1:**

Oh, Lord, You broke the hump of the bulls truly  
And secured (Nappiṉṉai), the red-lipped beauty;  
The king of Laṅkā, with ramparts high, you killed  
With Your bow infallible and out you pulled  
The tusk fine of that majestic elephant and slew it;  
At these crucial moments, I served you not in manner fit,  
With flowers fine and water pure and yet  
My mind is the sandal paste fit for your lovely body of lily tint.

**Notes**

\(i\) The Āḻvār regrets that he wasn’t keeping himself close to the Lord, when He tamed the unruly bulls for winning the hand of Nappiṉṉai, the charming bride, when he slew Rāvaṇa, the king of Laṅkā and killed Kuvalayāpīḍa, the high class elephant, set on Him by the treacherous Kaṃsa, by crushing its tusks. Had he (Āḻvār) been by the side of the Lord on those occasions, he could have tended Him well and relieved Him of the fatigue. Despite this lapse on his part, the Āḻvār wonders how the Lord looks upon his mind, with great delight, as if it was aromatic like high class sandal paste, fit for anointing His exquisite body.

\(ii\) Had the Āḻvār been by the side of Lord Kṛṣṇa when He pounced upon the unruly bulls, he could have cautioned Him that they were not bulls, as such, but demons in disguise, even as Lakṣmaṇa, pointed out to Śrī Rāma, that the deer, coveted by Sītā, was but a Rākṣasa in disguise.

\(iii\) There is no greater security for us than the Lord and yet, Rāvaṇa relied on his forts and moats, and Kaṃsa, on Kuvalayāpīḍa, the mighty tusker and the like and little wonder then, they all came to grief.




## 4.3.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

பூசும் சாந்து என் நெஞ்சமே புனையும் கண்ணி எனதுடைய,  
வாசகம் செய் மாலையே வான் பட்டு ஆடையும் அஃதே,  
தேசம் ஆன அணிகலனும் என் கைகூப்புச் செய்கையே,  
ஈசன் ஞாலம் உண்டு உமிழ்ந்த எந்தை ஏக மூர்த்திக்கே.

pūcum cāntu eṉ neñcamē puṉaiyum kaṇṇi eṉatuṭaiya,  
vācakam cey mālaiyē vāṉ paṭṭu āṭaiyum aḵtē,  
tēcam āṉa aṇikalaṉum eṉ kaikūppuc ceykaiyē,  
īcaṉ ñālam uṇṭu umiḻnta entai ēka mūrttikkē.

**English translation of verse 4.3.2:**

My mind alone is the sandal paste eminently fit  
For the supreme Lord of form unique  
Who once did gulp the worlds and then spat them out;  
The hymns by my tongue knit do His garlands make  
And His silken robes as well; my salutation with joined palms  
Decorates Him with many a jewel that gleams.

**Note**

The Āḻvār keeps meditating on the Lord’s resplendent Form and His extraordinary love for him. All the three faculties of the Āḻvār-word, deed and thought-are extremely delectable to Him and loom large in His eyes. If the Āḻvār’s mind is unto Him as aromatic as the sandal paste, his hymns are like unto the colourful garlands made of choice flowers of special fragrance. These very hymns of the Āḻvār also serve as the silken robes donned by the Lord with great pleasure. It is said that the apparel oft proclaims the man, and here, the Āḻvār’s hymns, proclaiming the Lord’s glory, serve as His apparel. And then, a single salutation made by the Āḻvār to the Lord by joining his palms, makes Him feel as though He has been fully decorated with jewels of extra-radiance. The Āḻvār is simply amazed at the astounding love of the Lord for him, as above.




## 4.3.3
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஏக மூர்த்தி இரு மூர்த்தி மூன்று மூர்த்தி பல மூர்த்தி-  
ஆகி, ஐந்து பூதம் ஆய் இரண்டு சுடர் ஆய் அருவு ஆகி,  
நாகம் ஏறி நடுக் கடலுள் துயின்ற நாராயணனே உன்-  
ஆகம் முற்றும் அகத்து அடக்கி ஆவி அல்லல் மாய்த்ததே.

ēka mūrtti iru mūrtti mūṉṟu mūrtti pala mūrtti-  
āki, aintu pūtam āy iraṇṭu cuṭar āy aruvu āki,  
nākam ēṟi naṭuk kaṭaluḷ tuyiṉṟa nārāyaṇaṉē uṉ-  
ākam muṟṟum akattu aṭakki āvi allal māyttatē.

**English translation of verse 4.3.3:**

You assumed a single form, then two, three and many,  
The form you took of the senses five, the Sun and the Moon;  
Formless, you did everywhere, as Internal Controller, pervade,  
Repose you did, Oh, Nārāyaṇa, in mid-ocean on serpent-bed  
And now your body and all it needs you have compressed  
Right in my mind and thus feel fully relaxed.

**Notes**

\(i\) Here is a complete reversal of the picture, we saw in the last decad. The Āḻvār, sunk deep in dejection in that decad, is now very happy and proclaims that the Lord is also jubilant that His task has been well done, having taken the Āḻvār unto His fold, with great delight.

\(ii\) *Single Form*: This refers to the state of affairs prior to creation, when the Lord alone subsisted, containing within Himself, in a subtle state, all sentient and non-sentient beings; there was no scope then for differentiation, by name and form.

\(iii\) *Two forms*: Keen on creating the Sportive Universe, the Lord assumes the twin forms of ‘Prakriti’ and ‘Mahān’

\(iv\) *Three Forms*: The triple ‘ahaṅkāras’ of Sattva, Rājas and Tāmas;

\(v\) *Many Forms*: The wonderful variety (i.e.) variegated forms of creation arising through inequalities among the three ‘Guṇas’, referred to in (4) above, the five sense-organs, the five elements etc.




## 4.3.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மாய்த்தல் எண்ணி வாய் முலை தந்த மாயப் பேய் உயிர்-  
மாய்த்த, ஆய மாயனே! வாமனனே மாதவா,  
பூத்தண் மாலை கொண்டு உன்னைப் போதால் வணங்கேனேலும், நின்  
பூத்தண் மாலை நெடுமுடிக்குப் புனையும் கண்ணி எனது உயிரே.

māyttal eṇṇi vāy mulai tanta māyap pēy uyir-  
māytta, āya māyaṉē! vāmaṉaṉē mātavā,  
pūttaṇ mālai koṇṭu uṉṉaip pōtāl vaṇaṅkēṉēlum, niṉ  
pūttaṇ mālai neṭumuṭikkup puṉaiyum kaṇṇi eṉatu uyirē.

**English translation of verse 4.3.4:**

My Lord, I served You not with garlands nice, when You killed  
The strange demoness with poisoned breast, who suckled  
You with intent to kill, when, as Vāmaṉaṉ, alms You did seek  
From Bali, when You churned the ocean and as ‘Mātavaṉ’ took  
Lakṣmī (Mother) on Your chest and yet, how is it, my life  
You hold dear like the garland on Your crown high?




## 4.3.5
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கண்ணி எனது உயிர் காதல் கனகச் சோதி முடிமுதலா,  
எண் இல் பல்கலன்களும் ஏலும் ஆடையும் அஃதே,  
நண்ணி மூவுலகும் நவிற்றும் கீர்த்தியும் அஃதே,  
கண்ணன் எம் பிரான் எம்மான் கால சக்கரத்தானுக்கே.

kaṇṇi eṉatu uyir kātal kaṉakac cōti muṭimutalā,  
eṇ il palkalaṉkaḷum ēlum āṭaiyum aḵtē,  
naṇṇi mūvulakum naviṟṟum kīrttiyum aḵtē,  
kaṇṇaṉ em pirāṉ emmāṉ kāla cakkarattāṉukkē.

**English translation of verse 4.3.5:**

Unto Lord Kaṇṇaṉ, my benefactor great, holding the discus that ‘Time’ controls,  
Delectable like the garland fine is my soul;  
Deems He my love as His gleaming gold crown smart,  
The jewels innumerable on His person, the silken robes appropriate  
And the praises the three worlds heap on Him, their aggregate.

**Notes**

\(i\) The Āḻvār speaks of the Lord’s adoration, strong and steadfast, of his soul and inordinate love for him. Having made the Āḻvār subsist in the real sense, the Godbound, rejuvenated life of the Āḻvār is as dear to Him as His famous garland ‘Vaijayanti’. And what more? The Lord sees the Āḻvār’s God-love as manifesting itself in His dazzling crown and the numerous jewels on His glowing person as well as the silken robes befitting Him. Again, He sees in the Āḻvār’s devotion for Him, the aggregate of the praises heaped on Him by all the worlds.

\(ii\) *Controller of the wheel of Time*: Had it not been for the fact that the Lord is the Controller of the past, present and future, He could not have fulfilled the aspiration of the Āḻvār to have a glimpse of His past Avatāras, as set out in the last decad. As a matter of fact, the present decad is only the outpouring of the Āḻvār, in grateful acknowledgement of the Lord’s extraordinary compliance.

\(iii\) Speaking about the Lord’s acceptance of the Āḻvār’s devotion as equivalent to the silken robes of His choice, here is an interesting anecdote:

One day, a Dhobi of the holy men of Śriraṅgam brought the clothes, *laundered by him with loving care*, to be worn by the Idol of Lord Raṅganātha, to the great Ācārya, Rāmānuja first, for his approbation. Very pleased with the extra-fine work of the washerman, Śrī Rāmānuja led him straight to the Shrine and requested Lord Raṅganātha to have a look at the clothes, laundered so well, befitting His august Self. The Lord not only condescended to signify His loving approval but also declared, “For the loving service of this washerman, we now grant reprieve to that other washerman, who offended us during our Avatāra as Kṛṣṇa”. It may be recalled that, when Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma went to Mathurā, escorted by Akrūra, the dhobi, who washed the clothes of King Kaṃsa, was passing along with a donkey-load of laundered clothes of the royalty. He, however, declined to supply the clothes demanded of him by the Divine Brothers. For that offence, committed nearly four thousand years earlier, the Lord, in His Iconic Form as Raṅganātha, now granted him pardon because of the devotion of the washerman ushered into His presence by Śrī Rāmānuja. This is a case of vicarious reward, rather, expiation, betokening the Lord’s adoration of the true devotion of His Subjects.




## 4.3.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கால சக்கரத்தொடு வெண் சங்கம் கை ஏந்தினாய்,  
ஞாலம் முற்றும் உண்டு உமிழ்ந்த நாராயணனே என்று என்று,  
ஓலம் இட்டு நான் அழைத்தால் ஒன்றும் வாராயாகிலும்,  
கோலம் ஆம் என் சென்னிக்கு உன் கமலம் அன்ன குரைகழலே.

kāla cakkarattoṭu veṇ caṅkam kai ēntiṉāy,  
ñālam muṟṟum uṇṭu umiḻnta nārāyaṇaṉē eṉṟu eṉṟu,  
ōlam iṭṭu nāṉ aḻaittāl oṉṟum vārāyākilum,  
kōlam ām eṉ ceṉṉikku uṉ kamalam aṉṉa kuraikaḻalē.

**English translation of verse 4.3.6:**

Oh, Lord, holding In your hands exquisite,  
The deadly discus and the conch white!  
Oh, Nārāyaṇa, Who once ate all the worlds and then spat out!  
Many a time, Your name I did call out;  
Even if You don’t respond at all, Your lotus feet.  
With the victorious anklets on, shall my head decorate.

**Note**

In the pieceding songs of this decad, the Lord’s love for the Āḻvār was expatiated on, and now, the Āḻvār’s reciprocal love for the Lord is being talked about. The Āḻvār avers that, even if the Lord studiously kept Himself away without responding to the repeated calls from him, His feet shall always adorn his head. It might be asked how the Lord’s feet could adorn the Āḻvār’s head, even when He is away. The Āḻvār subsists only on the sweet contemplation of the Lord’s feet and when he says, as above, he is only dwelling in his thoughts.




## 4.3.7
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

குரைகழல்கள் நீட்டி மண் கொண்ட கோல வாமனா,  
குரை கழல் கைகூப்புவார்கள் கூட நின்ற மாயனே,  
விரை கொள் பூவும் நீரும்கொண்டு ஏத்தமாட்டேனேலும், உன்  
உரை கொள் சோதித் திரு உருவம் என்னது ஆவி மேலதே.

kuraikaḻalkaḷ nīṭṭi maṇ koṇṭa kōla vāmaṉā,  
kurai kaḻal kaikūppuvārkaḷ kūṭa niṉṟa māyaṉē,  
virai koḷ pūvum nīrumkoṇṭu ēttamāṭṭēṉēlum, uṉ  
urai koḷ cōtit tiru uruvam eṉṉatu āvi mēlatē.

**English translation of verse 4.3.7:**

Oh, Vāmaṉā, the handsome, Your resounding feet  
Measured the worlds; they who but once salute  
Those feet shall attain You, wondrous Sire,  
Even if I worship You not with fragrant flowers  
And water pure, Your resplendent Form, which beggars  
Description, has made my Soul subsist, what a wonder!

**Notes**

\(i\) Despite the failure of the Āḻvār to worship, with flowers and water, the Lord, who is attainable by a single salutation with joined palms, the Āḻvār’s soul has become the sole object of redemption by the Lord! The Aḷver simply thaws down at this boundless love and magnanimity of the Lord.

\(ii\) It was Vāmaṉa, transformed into Trivikrama, that measured the worlds, in just three strides, and yet, the Āḻvār says, in this song, that Vāmaṉa did the job. This is because Vāmaṉa’s bewitching beauty has such a strong hold on the Āḻvār.




## 4.3.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

என்னது ஆவி மேலையாய் ஏர் கொள் ஏழ் உலகமும்,  
துன்னி முற்றும் ஆகி நின்ற சோதி ஞான மூர்த்தியாய்,  
உன்னது என்னது ஆவியும், என்னது உன்னது ஆவியும்  
இன்ன வண்ணமே நின்றாய் என்று உரைக்க வல்லேனே?

eṉṉatu āvi mēlaiyāy ēr koḷ ēḻ ulakamum,  
tuṉṉi muṟṟum āki niṉṟa cōti ñāṉa mūrttiyāy,  
uṉṉatu eṉṉatu āviyum, eṉṉatu uṉṉatu āviyum  
iṉṉa vaṇṇamē niṉṟāy eṉṟu uraikka vallēṉē?

**English translation of verse 4.3.8:**

With love intense for my soul, you did, in full, pervade  
The lovely worlds seven, all things are but your modes;  
Radiant knowledge personified, you have my soul in you blended  
And yours in me; how can I express this blending unique indeed?

**Notes**

\(i\) The original text lends itself to a two-fold interpretation, namely:

\(a\) Having secured my soul and thus made it subsist in the real sense, You are mighty pleased and are even inclined to feel that the purpose of Your immanence was achieved only when you got at me. This is like a whole town being besieged, for capturing just one person.

\(b\) Very keen on getting at me, You pervaded all things in their entirety, to ensure that I don’t slip off, by any means.

\(ii\) It sounds rather odd that the Lord’s Soul should be at the disposal of the Āḻvār. But the illustrious Yāmunācārya put it straight, by pointing out that there was nothing odd about this, because there is none to inhibit the Lord when, at His volition, He chooses to place Himself at the disposal of one of His subjects. When the individual Soul has to attain the Lord, the former’s ‘*Karma*’ could operate as the impediment, which has to be cut out, by His grace. In the reverse gear of the Lord subordinating Himself to the Individual, there can be no obstruction whatsoever!




## 4.3.9
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

உரைக்க வல்லேன் அல்லேன் உன் உலப்பு இல் கீர்த்தி வெள்ளத்தின்  
கரைக்கண் என்று செல்வன் நான்? காதல் மையல் ஏறினேன்,  
புரைப்பு இலாத பரம்பரனே! பொய் இலாத பரஞ்சுடரே,  
இரைத்து நல்ல மேன்மக்கள் ஏத்த யானும் ஏத்தினேன்.

uraikka vallēṉ allēṉ uṉ ulappu il kīrtti veḷḷattiṉ  
karaikkaṇ eṉṟu celvaṉ nāṉ? kātal maiyal ēṟiṉēṉ,  
puraippu ilāta paramparaṉē! poy ilāta parañcuṭarē,  
iraittu nalla mēṉmakkaḷ ētta yāṉum ēttiṉēṉ.

**English translation of verse 4.3.9:**

Oh, Lord, complete and certain are your sovereignty and splendour  
(Like unto your mingling with me); I can hardly express  
Whether at all I can find the shore of the ocean endless  
Of your connubial love; steeped in love, I do praise  
You, a little, in the foot-steps of the Celestials, good and great,  
Who your glory chant in tones that reverberate.

**Note**

The Āḻvār is well aware of his incompetence to sing the praise of the Lord of limitless glory; for the matter of that, the Celestials (Nitya Sūrīs) also fall far short, in this regard, their eminence notwithstanding. Even the Lord does not know the full extent of His glory. That being the case, the Āḻvār praises the Lord, in a state of ecstatic imbalance, lured by the roaring sound of chanting by the Celestials. After His mingling with the Āḻvār, well and truly, the Lord’s sovereignty is also complete and His splendour real.




## 4.3.10
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

யானும் ஏத்தி ஏழ் உலகும் முற்றும் ஏத்தி, பின்னையும்  
தானும் ஏத்திலும் தன்னை ஏத்த ஏத்த எங்கு எய்தும்,  
தேனும் பாலும் கன்னலும் அமுதும் ஆகித் தித்திப்ப,  
யானும் எம் பிரானையே ஏத்தினேன் யான் உய்வானே

yāṉum ētti ēḻ ulakum muṟṟum ētti, piṉṉaiyum  
tāṉum ēttilum taṉṉai ētta ētta eṅku eytum,  
tēṉum pālum kaṉṉalum amutum ākit tittippa,  
yāṉum em pirāṉaiyē ēttiṉēṉ yāṉ uyvāṉē

**English translation of verse 4.3.10:**

How can it ever exhaust His great glory  
If I sang His praise, followed by all the worlds  
And the Lord Himself? sweet unto me like honey,  
Milk and candy, subsist do I, lauding my nectarean Lord.

**Note**

The Āḻvār, blest by the Lord with divine knowledge, full and complete, sings His praise, all the worlds without distinction of high and low, knowledgeable or otherwise, extol Him and then, the Omniscient, Omnipotent Lord Himself follows suit. And yet, all of them, put together cannot exhaust His glory, even if they sang His praise for ages, notwithstanding the involvement of the Loṛd Himself in this project, because His glory is limitless. The Āḻvār, deeply conscious of the felicities showered on him by the Lord, goes on singing the glory of the Lord, sweet unto him like all things delicious put together; otherwise he just cannot subsist.




## 4.3.11
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

உய்வு உபாயம் மற்று இன்மை தேறி கண்ணன் ஒண் கழல்கள் மேல்  
செய்ய தாமரைப் பழனத் தென்னன் குருகூர்ச் சடகோபன்,  
பொய் இல் பாடல் ஆயிரத்துள் இவையும் பத்தும் வல்லார்கள்,  
வையம் மன்னி வீற்றிருந்து விண்ணும் ஆள்வர் மண்ணூடே. (2)

uyvu upāyam maṟṟu iṉmai tēṟi kaṇṇaṉ oṇ kaḻalkaḷ mēl  
ceyya tāmaraip paḻaṉat teṉṉaṉ kurukūrc caṭakōpaṉ,  
poy il pāṭal āyirattuḷ ivaiyum pattum vallārkaḷ,  
vaiyam maṉṉi vīṟṟiruntu viṇṇum āḷvar maṇṇūṭē. (2)

**English translation of verse 4.3.11:**

Those well-versed in these songs ten,  
Out of the veracious thousand composed by Caṭakōpaṉ  
Of lovely Teṉ kurukūr, with lotus ponds and fields fertile,  
Adoring the comely feet of Kaṇṇaṉ, for sheer survival,  
Will for long flourish in this abode  
And rule as well, right from here, the heavenly abode.

**Notes**

\(i\) The Āḻvār spoke about the love that subsists between him and his beloved, the Supreme Lord, in this decad, not because he could talk about it, in any appreciable measure, but for his mere survival.

\(ii\) Even as Brahma assured Sage Vālmiki, that not a word in the great Kāvya (Rāmāyaṇa) would be untrue, the Dramiḍa Veda (Tiruvāymoḻi) is of unquestionable veracity.

The truthfulness, claimed for the Sanskrit Vedas, equally holds good, in respect of the Tamil Veda.

\(iii\) Prior to his being brought into the Śrī Vaiṣṇava fold, the illustrious Preceptor, Nañcīyar (formerly known as Vedānti) was a staunch exponent of Advaita philosophy. Śrī Parāśara Bhaṭṭar conquered Vedānti in a religious disquisition, held at the latter’s home town (Melkōt in Karnataka State) and thereafter, Vedānti, turned into the ascetic Nañcīyar, got himself inducted by Bhaṭṭārya into the rapturous realm of the ‘Divya Prabhandas’. Little wonder, an intellectual giant that Nañcīyar was, he soon mastered the four thousand hymns of the Āḻvārs and imparted special lustre to the commentaries thereon. He longed to Listen to the discourses at the feet of Bhaṭṭārya but the latter passed away at the tender age of 32. Whenever Nañcīyar recited this Song, he suffered the pangs of separation from the Master, all the more.

\(iv\) Verily, the chanters of this decad would be able to grant passport to heaven, to the people of their choice, right from here, betokening their sway over heaven.
