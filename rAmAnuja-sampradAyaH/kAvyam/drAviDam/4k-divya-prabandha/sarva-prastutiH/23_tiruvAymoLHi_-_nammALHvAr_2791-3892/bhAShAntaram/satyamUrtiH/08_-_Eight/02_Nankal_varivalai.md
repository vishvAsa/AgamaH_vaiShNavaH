## 00 Intro9.2
In the last decad, the Āḻvār began to suspect that, with his coming into the world, the Lord’s reputation as the repository of many an auspicious trait and the grand ordainer of all things, was becoming extinct. The Āḻvār was, however, brought back to normal thinking by the Lord and the Āḻvār’s misgivings were cleared up in a way. But then, the external perception of the Lord’s exquisite Form and physical contact, longed for by the Saint, did not, as yet, materialise. This, therefore, gave rise to yet another doubt in the mind of the Āḻvār whether the Lord was keeping away from him on the ground that he was still not quite free from worldly desires. No doubt, the Āḻvār kept himself studiously aloof from the world and its meretritious charms, as far as he could be conscious of it. And yet, the Omniscient Lord might have found traces of worldly desires still lurking inside the Āḻvār unknown to him, and this was perhaps the reason why the Lord was holding back. The Āḻvār. therefore, thought of clearing up even this inkling of a doubt and vindicating his absolute detachment from the world and its affairs, but did not open up a direct dialogue with the Lord. Instead, he resorted to the device of informing the Lord and impressing upon  
Him through argumentation between the Nāyakī and her mates and elders, the theme of the dialogue being as follows:

The Nāyakī (Āḻvār) who got separated from the Supreme Lord after her erstwhile union with Him cannot contain herself and patiently await His return. She, therefore, darts forth, in an attempt to meet her Lord in His dwelling place in the yonder region but gets pulled up by her mates for transgression of the norms of feminine conduct and the restraint of modesty which it imposes. The mates counsel patience but it falls on deaf ears. The Nāyakī sternly declines to conform to the so-called norms of the worldlings, being on a pedestal of her own, totally dissociating herself from all things ungodly and fiercely concentrating on her Lord, with no other thought, crossing her mind.

Against this background, the key stanzas of this decad are the seventh, eighth and the eleventh.

**English translation of verse 8.2.1:**

Ye, my mates, bedecked with bangles nice,  
I wish I could in you confide and freely tell  
What unto hostile elders I feel shy to disclose,  
And yet, words I find not, my thoughts to spell;  
My Lord at Tiruvēṅkaṭam Who conducts the bird  
With hot eyes, I desired to see and ḻo! lose I did  
My complexion fine, down the wrists my bangles slid,  
With the colour off my breasts, I just became jaded.

**Notes:**

\(i\) Finding the Nāyakī off colour and debilitated, her mates enquired of her what was going wrong with her. The Nāyakī felt shy to disclose her love-sickness but her friendly mates could put her at ease. Even then, words failed her and, at long last, she gave out the genesis of her malady, as above.

\(ii\) The bangles would not rest on the wrists of the Nāyakī, grown gaunt and emaciated, while the mates had their bangles, *in tact*. Even as Lakṣmaṇa, whose grief over Sītā’s abduction, stemming from a stinging sense of unwariness on his part, was even greater than Śrī Rāma’s, steadied himself so as to be fit to serve Śrī Rāma all right, the mates here had to keep themselves fit, in order to bring the Nāyakī round, instead of lamenting along with her.

\(iii\) The elders have absolute faith in the Lord’s grace, which is bound to lead them on to the final goal without fail. They would, therefore, counsel the Nāyakī to coolly await the descent of the Lord’s grace at His sweet will, without getting jittery. This kind of advice is, however, unpalatable to the Nāyakī, who is all agog for the quick consummation of her inordinate God-love and hence, the elders are deemed by her to be hostile. And now, hostility is of two kinds, the inner and the outer, as brought out in aphorism 139 of ‘Ācārya Hṛdayam’. Those, who employ ‘means’ other than the Lord Himself to attain Him, are regarded as the external enemies while those who look upon God as the ‘Ready Means’, the ‘Siddhopāya’, and yet remain opposed to getting into a state of flutter and throbbing for quick consummation, on the ground that it militates against the creed of ‘Pāratantrya’ (exclusive dependence on the Lord), are categorised by the Nāyakī as the internal enemies.

\(iv\) *Garuḍa, the hot-eyed bird*:

Garuḍa, being hot-eyed, is, at times, favourable, and unfavourable at other times, depending upon the particular mood of the God-lover. This mighty bird could quell the ungodly with blistering looks and fly the Lord unerringly down to where the Nāyakī is eagerly awaiting His arrival. The Nāyakī would then thank Garuḍa for his good offices. The same Nāyakī would, however, speak disparagingly of the bird, when he takes away the Lord from her and leaves her sadly alone, as in her present state of ‘Viśleṣa’ (separation). This is just like the Gopis (the damsels of Virundāvan) dubbing the saintly Akrūra as the one with a cruel heart, who separated them from Kṛṣṇa and took Him to Kaṃsa’s citadel (Mathurā)—‘Akrūraḥ Krūrahrudayaḥ’.

\(v\) The Lord has some down all the way from Heaven to Mount Tiruvēṅkatam, to be beheld by us all. He has not come to the Nāyakī and so, she thought of going up to this holy centre, specially courted by Him. But these are the changes instantly wrought in her—the sliding down of the bangles, loss of complexion and all that.




## 8.2.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

**English translation of verse 8.2.2:**

Alas! I know not, in my present state of woe,  
What to say of me even unto You, my mates dear!  
Who would from me always get whatever you desire;  
Were I to see the lotus-eyed Lord, bewitching to behold.  
Who by His looks could our hearts steal, the Sovereign Lord  
Of the Celestials and us alike, I can unto me get restored  
My bangles and modesty and for this I am since long trying hard.

**Notes:**

Ever since the Lord withdrew Himself from the Nāyakī’s vision, she has been without her bangles which slid down her wrists, and the innate sense of modesty, characteristic of women under restraint. It is only when she gets the vision back again, she can hope to get back her lost possessions. It is a pity, she is still in a state of longing, with fulfilment nowhere in sight.




## 8.2.3
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

காலம் இளைக்கில் அல்லால் வினையேன் நான் இளைக்கின்றிலன் கண்டு கொள்மின்  
ஞாலம் அறியப் பழிசுமந்தேன் நல்நுதலீர்! இனி நாணித்தான்என்  
நீலமலர் நெடும்சோதிசூழ்ந்த நீண்டமுகில்வண்ணன் கண்ணன் கொண்ட

kōlavaḷaiyoṭum māmaikoḷvāṉ ettaṉaikālamum kūṭacceṉṟē?

**English translation of verse 8.2.3:**

I am in endless pursuit of Kaṇṇaṉ, my cloud-hued Lord,  
Of limitless blue, beaming far and wide, to get unto me restored,  
My bangles lovely and complexion fair; Indeed, the whole world,  
Blames me for transgression of my bounds, Ye, mates with foreheads bright.  
There’s no use my fighting shy anymore, please note;  
This sinner will persevere and me Time can never beat.

**Notes:**

Apart from the crowning trait of modesty for women, as a class, the ‘Prapanna’, who pursues the path of loving surrender to the Lord’s voluntary grace, has to await the descent of such grace at the time deemed appropriate by the Lord, with absolute faith in Him, a robust confidence. It is this very plank, the mates also stand upon and so, they try to bring round the Nāyāki. But the Nāyakī says, she has become brazen, after all the notoriety and opprobrium she has earned by dint of her sending the birds and bees as emissaries (1-4) and her attempt to come into the open and arraign the Lord for His cruel unresponsiveness (5-3). She is determined to try till the end of time and get back her bangles, the external possession, and modesty, the internal decoration, stolen away from her by the Lord of exquisite charm. This is, as it were, a challenge to the mates who advised the Nāyakī to give up her futile pursuit, right now, instead of acknowledging defeat at a later date, after a long and strenuous struggle.




## 8.2.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கூடச்சென்றேன் இனி என்கொடுக்கேன்? கோல்வளை நெஞ்சத் தொடக்கம் எல்லாம்  
பாடுஅற்றுஒழிய இழந்துவைகல் பல்வளையார்முன் பரிசுஅழிந்தேன்

āṭalpaṟavai uyarttavelpōr āḻivalavaṉai ātarittē.

**English translation of verse 8.2.4:**

Court did I Lord Māyakkūttaṉ, borne aloft by the gay bird,  
Enshrined in the western part of Teṉkuḻantai with castles tall  
And stately walls, Who the victorious disc does wield,  
And lost my bangles lovely, my mind, one and all;  
Indeed I have nothing more to lose, having lost, long back,  
My feminine bearing, in the eyes of the women wearing bangles, in bulk.

**Notes:**

\(i\) This song brings out the Āḻvār’s adoration of Māyakkūtṭaṉ, the Deity enshrined in Tenkuḷantai, popularly known as Peruṅkuḻam, near Āḻvār Tirunakari (Kurukūr), the birthplace of the Saint.

\(ii\) *Māyakkūttaṉ*: This could either refer to Lord Kṛṣṇa’s vast array of wondrous deeds, performed during the brief span of His advent over here, right in the middle of the rituals performed by the Celestials in the yonder Heaven, as part of their diurnal worship of the Lord in His transcendent Form.

or

Generally, the Lord who binds us to this body, like unto a bird’s nest and watches all the fun and frolic that follow.

\(iii\) Garuḍa flutters its wings with hilarious joy, in contemplation of the prospective outing of the Lord mounted on him.

\(iv\) When the mates chide the Nāyakī that, by her daring she stood to lose all her possessions, one by one, she replies that there is nothing more to lose, having already lost her all.




## 8.2.5
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஆழிவலவனை ஆதரிப்பும் ஆங்குஅவன் நம்மில் வரவும் எல்லாம்  
தோழியர்காள்! நம்உடையமேதான்? சொல்லுவதோ இங்கு அரியதுதான்

cūḻaluṭaiya cuṭarkoḷātit tollaiamcōti niṉaikkuṅkālē.

**English translation of verse 8.2.5:**

Ye, mates, it would hardly be proper to say things harsh  
About the Lord wielding the discus, the Primate of brilliance everlasting,  
Of ultra-mundane origin, of wondrous deeds which the devotees enthral,  
Whose glory even the most knowledgeable can’t fathom and comprehend,  
However much and however long they might try to find;  
’Tis nothing new for devotees to covet Him and for Him to respond.

**Notes:**

\(i\) Trying to convict the Nāyakī out of her own mouth, the mates advise her not to court the Lord and lose all her possessions in the process, as owned by her in the immediately preceding song. Pat comes the admonition from the Nāyakī, warning them against any possible misunderstanding of the Lord’s glory and greatness and dubbing Him as callous, hard-hearted and so on. It was not as if she was the only God-lover, subject to such fluctuations. There have been very many God-lovers before, who did covet the Lord’s presence and craved, like Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī, for incessant communion with Him and the Lord also graciously responded and mingled with the devout very freely, exhibiting many wonderful traits and deeds.

\(ii\) The statement that intellectual stalwarts too cannot comprehend the Lord, even if they should engage themselves in such pursuit for ages, might seem to come into conflict with the texts, such as, ‘Vedāhametaṃ Puruṣaṃ Mahāntaṃ’, ‘Aham vedmi Mahātmānaṃ’ etc., which claim to know God. The authority to whom these texts apply is what is called the Brahma-Jñāni or ‘Tattva vith’, the knower of Brahman, the ultimate Principle or Truth. Well, all that these eminent persons could know is that the Lord cannot be fully comprehended and His ways are inscrutable. For example, the Lord Himself has declared many a time that He would act only when Mahālakṣmī plays the recommendatory role, mediating and pleading for the supplicants at the door-step. And yet, He would also say, ‘Nāsou Puruṣakāreṇa nacāpyanyena hetunā, Kevalaṃ svecchāyaivāhaṃ prekṣa kañcit Kathācana’, that is, He could not be coaxed into redeeming His subjects by any means including the mediation of the Divine Mother and that His own will was paramount, in the matter of extending His grace. Again, He has declared, in unambiguous terms His severe displeasure in regard to the transgression of the dictates of the Scriptures, which are but His commands—‘Śrutis Śmṛtir Mamaivajña yasth āmullangya vartate, āgnāccheti Mama dhrohi Madbhaktopi na vaiṣṇavaḥ’. And yet, in Chapter IX-30 of Bhagavad Gītā, this stern warning would seem to have got totally diluted, when Lord Kṛṣṇa averred, “apicet sudurācāraḥ bhajate Mām ananya bhāk, Sādhureva samantavyaḥ Samyagvyavasito hi saḥ”, that is, “Even he, who has committed grave breaches of the codes of conduct, appropriate to the different stations in life, deserves to be placed on a par with a Saint and honoured likewise, if he meditates on Me, with selffess devotion, with no other end in view.” Did not Lord Rāma wind up the heated debate on Vibhīṣaṇa’s admission into His camp, by announcing His great creed of granting asylum to any one, who sought refuge in Him and responding, without fail, to the call of a destitute, be he friendly or a foe in the guise of a friend, and whatever be the magnitude of his sins? How then can anyone, however exalted and sagacious, claim to have known fully, the Lord and His ways? The only exception could, of course, be the chosen few unto whom the Lord has revealed Himself, *in toto*, and imparted crystal-clear knowledge, shorn of all doubts, discrepancies and deviations.

\(iii\) The Nāyakī’s hopes are kept alive because the Great One, Who baffles scrutiny and defies description, is also known to be amazingly simple, mixing freely with His ardent devotees. How then can the mates dissuade the Nāyakī from pinning her faith in His condescending love?




## 8.2.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

தொல்லையஞ்சோதி நினைக்குங்கால் என் சொல்அளவன்று இமையோர் தமக்கும்

**English translation of verse 8.2.6:**

Tell me, my mates, to whom else I shall my woes depose,  
When the resplendent Lord of prowess extra-ordinary, much beyond the grasp  
Of even Celestials, the Great one of amazing grandeur, Who does repose  
In Tirukkuṭantai amid nice gardens and fields fertile, who did grab  
My complexion fair but wouldn’t favour me with tuḷaci garland, full of fragrance.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The mates would appear to have been prodding the Nāyakī, saying that the Lord is indeed dear to attain and not the easily accessible one, as she was making out. The Nāyakī, however, effectively silences them by pointing out that it matters not whether He is near or far, seeing that He has kept her mind solely fixed on Him. And, in this state of mind, the Nāyakī sees no other way but to be a supplicant at His door-step, instead of hanging on to those with whom she has nothing to do. As a matter of fact, it would not be possible even to the exalted Celestials like Brahmā and Rudra to define the Lord’s stance with any degree of certainty. He, who is beyond reach some times, is the most easily attainable at other times, and the doubt, therefore, assails the minds of one and all, high and low, as to what the Lord would be like, at any one time. In the ‘Mokṣa Dharma’ of Mahābhārata, Brahmā said unto Rudra, that none, including them, could fathom the infinite Mind of the Lord and plumb its mysterious depths.

\(ii\) Such a Great one condescended to reveal His exquisite Form unto the Nāyakī and steal away her heart, as evidenced by the discoloration that has set in. During those moments of His union with the Nayaki, He was totally subservient to her but now that He keeps aloof of her, He would not care to give her even the tuḷaci garland worn on His person, which could, to some extent, alleviate her suffering. Even so, it behoves her to wait at His door-step only, whatever be His dispensation, good, bad or indifferent, because of the inalienable link between the two.

**English translation of verse 8.2.7:**

Ye, elders, with fragrant locks, flower-bedecked, Ye, my mates.  
His names, my Lord has made me cry out,  
As Māl, Ari, Kēcavaṉ, Nāraṇaṉ, Cīmātavaṉ, Kōvintaṉ, Vaikuṇṭaṉ, and so on,  
But of Him no trace could I see; what shall be done?  
Till the end of time, struggle shall I, on and on  
And see Him, sure and certain, let me swear,  
There’s indeed no link ‘tween you and me I am sure.

**Notes:**

\(i\) Even when the Lord keeps aloof, the subject cannot help pining for Him and uttering His sweet names, expressive of His auspicious attributes and wondrous deeds, as the sole means of subsistence. That is why Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī resent the advice tendered by her mates, not to attempt the unattainable but stay quiet. She would rather cut away from her kith and kin who can’t see eye to eye with her. (See the concluding para of the preamble to this decad) The Lord (Tirumāl) known to possess boundless love for His devotees, cannot keep away from them for long; He is Ari (Hari) the destroyer of all our sins which impede our union with Him; He is Keśava, whose dark, curly locks entrance the devotees and He should be fully aware that the Nāyakī would be musing over this sheer beauty, all the time; and then, He is Nārāyaṇā, of tender solicitude for the devotees, ‘Aśṛtavatsala’ and also ‘Mādhava’ (Cirīmātavaṉ) Who, by reason of His conjunction with the Divine Mother (Śrī), would never give up the devotees; He is Kōvintaṉ (Govinda) Who subserves those that take refuge in Him and all these qualities only go to embellish His transcendent glory as ‘Vaikuntaṉ’ residing in that super-eminent abode, known as Heaven.

\(ii\) Although the Nāyakī called out the Lord’s names lustily, yet, He was nowhere in sight. When Bharata went to the forest to meet Śrī Rāma, the former could locate the latter’s residence with the aid of the smoke that shot up in the sky from the ritual-fire. But, in the Nāyakī’, case, currently there is no trace whatever of the Lord nor any clue regarding His whereabouts.




## 8.2.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

**English translation of verse 8.2.8:**

Ye, parrots, peacocks, Koels, little Pūvai birds, my pets all,  
There’s nothing more you can from me have, my possessions, one and all,  
The Lord has from me snatched ‘tis, however, not difficult to attain hence  
Vaikuntam, Milk-ocean, Mount Añcaṉam and other holy centres,  
But these the Lord reveals not unless one sheds the last shred  
Of attachment unto things in the domain outside.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The main theme of this decad being complete eschewal of, and total dissociation from all things ungodly, this is yet another topical stanza of the decad. (See also stanza 7)

\(ii\) The pets were reared up by the Nāyakī merely as ancillary to her God-enjoyment, by way of heightening the enjoyment and now, in her present state of separation from her beloved Lord, all these birds are of no avail and the Nāyakī doesn’t hesitate to sever her connection with these unwanted pets, in the same way as she stands apart from her mates and the elders who tempt her the wrong way. A doubt might, however, arise, at this stage, how these birds, which are said to denote the great preceptors (Ācāryas), as elucidated earlier, could at all be discarded notwithstanding their exalted position as the sure Guides to Heaven. As a matter of fact, in Saint Rāmānuja’s swan-song, ‘Śaraṇāgati gadya’, he specifically includes even the preceptors in the category of persons, dear and near, excluded by him, ‘Gurūn santyajya’. The idea behind this is that one’s parents, wife, sons, relations, friends and preceptor, loved and adored, as belonging to the Lord, have also to be eschewed, if they turned out to be inimical to God-enjoyment. Vide also aphorism 153 of ‘Ācārya Hṛdayam

\(iii\) The Lord having forsaken the Nāyakī after His erstwhile union with her, He has simultaneously deprived her of her fair complexion, bangles, mind and all, which He has taken with Him to the yonder Heaven, thinking that it is much beyond the Nāyakī’s reach. But the Nāyakī is well aware that the Heaven is not that remote and unattainable, being, as a matter of fact, the destined Land, the ultimate destination of every one, which the Supersensitive Lord shall, however, make available only when the earthly desires and sensual pleasures are given up in toto and one loves Him exclusively. Mount Añcaṉam, mentioned in this song, is Mount Tiruvēṅkaṭam. This holy centre and the Milk-ocean are held on a par with Heaven.

**English translation of verse 8.2.9:**

My mates with foreheads bright, I have to lose nothing more,  
Having my feminity lost and with that, my sense of modesty  
Unto the Lord of the Celestials, with shoulders many, bright and hefty,  
Who the most exalted eludes and remains unseen but aid appear before (Bali), as the unique Vāmana, charming beyond compare,  
And did from him snatch, on the sly, all the worlds,  
Earth, Svarga and all, which He did span and pervade.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The Nāyakī averred in the preceding song that the Lord would certainly grant admission to His transcendent abode, if we unreservedly gave up attachment to all things ungodly. She was hit back by the mates, who said that ail that the Nāyakī could do was to sever her connections with them and go on losing all her possessions, one by one, but she would never gain the Lord, she longed for, at such great cost. And now, the Nāyakī says that she has nothing more to lose, having already lost her feminine bearing itself, along with modesty, its essential ingredient. She has thus lost both her priceless kingdoms, whereas the Lord restored to Indra, his lost kingdom, getting it back from Mahābali. The Nāyakī and Bali sail in the same boat, both having lost their respective kingdoms, enthralled by the Lord’s exquisite charm. Even so, Bali won everlasting fame as a great donor.

\(ii\) The Lord would not reveal Himself to those, who seek to gain His presence, by dint of their own efforts, however exalted they might be. So far as the Nāyakī is concerned, she has been enthralled by His bewitching beauty, which He revealed unto her and, in the process, He has stolen away her heart and all, even as He appeared before Mahābali, as the exquisite Vāmana and snatched away all his possessions. The shoulders and the entire frame of the Lord’s person went on expanding the moment Bali poured water into His right palm, betokening his gift unto the Lord of what was sought of him.

**English translation of verse 8.2.10:**

My mates with foreheads bright, me my mind has forsaken  
And attained the lovely feet, like unto lotus in fresh bloom,  
Of the Lord, Who does the conch and discus wield and gleam  
Like a lovely blue mountain, tall and mobile, bearing on its crown  
The effulgent Sun with multiple rays besides the silvery moon;  
What then can I do, thus dispossessed of my mind?

**Notes:**

\(i\) The elders coaxed the Nāyakī, saying that they are the persons really interested in her well-being and she was, therefore, bound to listen to their advice. But the Nāyakī felt helpless, having become totally unreceptive and impervious to advice of any kind, in the absence of her mind, which has already crossed over to the Lord and taken shelter at His lovely feet, much beyond her reach, at the moment.

\(ii\) The hefty Lord of bluish tint is like unto a gigantic blue emerald mountain, tall and lovely; His holding the radiant discus and the white conch looks like the Sun and the Moon rising on the crest of a blue mountain simultaneously, a phenomenon which can hardly be noticed, except in the person of the Lord and is thus as unique as the Lord Himself.




## 8.2.11
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

பாதம் அடைவதன் பாசத்தாலே மற்றவன்பாசங்கள் முற்றவிட்டு  
கோதில்புகழ்க்கண்ணன் தன்அடிமேல் வண்குருகூர்ச் சடகோபன்சொன்ன  
தீதில் அந்தாதிஓர் ஆயிரத்துள் இவையும்ஓர் பத்து இசையொடும் வல்லார்  
ஆதும்ஓர் தீதுஇலர்ஆகி இங்கும்அங்கும் எல்லாம் அமைவார்கள் தாமே. (2)

**English translation of verse 8.2.11:**

Those that sing tunefully these ten songs unique,  
Out of the flawless thousand, graciously, composed by Caṭakōpaṉ,  
Of Kurukūr, who to attain Lord Kaṅṅaṉ’s feet was very keen  
And adored His glory immaculate, shedding all desires, alien  
To the cherished goal, will from blemishes of all kinds be absolved  
And enjoy the best of all good things, here and abroad.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The end-stanza gives out the benefit accruing from the tuneful chanting of this decad, namely, God-enjoyment, both here and in the yonder Heaven, *completely purged of all grossness and worldly desires*. The portion underlined is the key-note of this decad. As a matter of fact, these chanters will gain unique prominence, both in this world and the yonder heaven.

\(ii\) By the immaculate glory of the Lord is meant that, by meditating upon which one cannot entertain any other desire. Should the two, however, go hand-in-hand, it shall indeed be a reflection on the self-sufficiency of the Lord’s glory for one’s exclusive enjoyment and will thus constitute a blemish. The flawlessness of this hymnal of Nammāḻvār and its exclusive excellence, rather incomparable excellence, have already been brought out at the appropriate places, and do not, therefore, need repetition.
