## 00 Intro7.2
Towards the end of the sixth centum, we saw the Āḻvār surrendering himself at the feet of the Lord at Tiruvēṅkaṭam. Finding, however, that he was still lingering in this material world, dominated by the unruly senses, he cried out his fears in the last decad. like unto a child crying out from the tiger’s jaws, facing the mother standing in front. The Lord was, no doubt, well aware of the intensity of the Āḻvār’s God-love and his deep yearning to get out of the material shackles with no further delay. And yet. He deliberately prolonged the Āḻvār’s stay in this abode and his resultant uneasiness, just to do lasting good to the world at large through him. Of course, this is like starving one’s children and entertaining the guests. Actually, the Āḻvār wrought the miracle of transforming the very duds and the deluded, given up as incorrigibles even by the Omnipotent Lord and every moment of his stay in this abode would certainly enrich the world through the scintillating hymns flowing from his lips, both by way of adoring the Lord and advising the world.

But then, the Āḻvār, in deep anguish, is once again (figuratively) transformed as the Nāyakī (Mistress), weighed down by melancholy too deep for words. The critical condition of the speechless Nāyakī and her various moods are narrated in this decad by the (Imagined) mother to Lord Raṅganātha, enshrined in Śrīraṅgam (Tamilnadu), bending over her daughter, right in the Sanctum. The mother enquires of Lord Raṅganātha, the Sole Saviour, as to what His intentions are and how exactly He would like to deal with her lovetom daughter.

Whenever Śrī Parāśara Bhaṭṭar discoursed on this decad, he would place both his palms over his head, charged with emotion, and cry, “How can we, hard-hearted people, incapable of feeling the pulse of Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī, her sentiments and yearning do justice to the words of deep love uttered by her in this decad?” How can any one indeed enter into the spirit of the Nayakī whose torrential tears were bailed out by her palms? It was like attempting to drain off the oceanic waters with a tiny leaf. c.f. Hanumān’s enquiry as soon as he met Sītā in Aśoka vana how it was that tears kept flowing from her lovely eyes like a cascade.




## 7.2.1
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கங்குலும் பகலும் கண் துயில் அறியாள் கண்ண நீர் கைகளால் இறைக்கும்,  
சங்கு சக்கரங்கள் என்று கை கூப்பும் தாமரைக் கண் என்றே தளரும்,  
எங்ஙனே தரிக்கேன் உன்னைவிட்டு என்னும் இரு நிலம் கை துழா இருக்கும்,  
செங்கயல் பாய் நீர்த் திருவரங்கத்தாய்! இவள் திறத்து என் செய்கின்றாயே? (2)

**English translation of verse 7.2.1:**

Oh, Lord, reclining in Tiruvaraṅkam where flows water in abundance;  
And the gay fish gambol, this lady knows no sleep, day and night,  
Tears in torrents from her eyes do flow and she with her palms bails them out;  
Utters she with joined palms, “Oh conch,”, “Oh discus”, “these are the lotus eyes”,  
She says and reels, all earth she gropes for her Lord from whom she can’t bear  
Being apart, what indeed do you intend doing with her?

**Notes:**

\(i\) The worldlings are steeped in sleep, both day and night, while the Celestials in Heaven have neither nights nor sleep. The Nāyakī also knows no sleep, like the Celestials. It is said that she knows no sleep instead of saying that she doesn’t sleep, because when in communion with the Lord, He wouldn’t allow her to sleep and, when away from Him, she is so disconsolate and dejected that she just can’t sleep. Either way, sleep is unknown to her.

\(ii\) Tears trickling down the cheeks copiously could be a common occurrence in the case of devout contemplation of the Lord’s auspicious traits and heroic deeds. Bailing out the tears with the Nāyakī’s palms, denotes

' the abundance of tears like the water in the river Cauvery flowing around. Reference to the fish joyfully dancing in the river waters carries with it the suggestion that even as the fish cannot stay out of water, the Nāyakī can’t stay apart from the Lord. Delirious that she is, she can still behold the Lord in His iconic Form right in front and suddenly she exclaims, “here is the conch, here ḷs the discus, here are the lotus-eyes” and so on. As one subsisting solely on Him, she can’t bear being apart from Him and she says so. Even then, she can’t find Him beside her and she runs her fingers through the whole Earth in search of Him, as if He is handy, like taking sandal paste from a porcelain cup.

\(iii\) The mother exhibits the love-smitten Nāyakī even as the Ṛṣis of Daṇḍakāraṇya showed Rāma their emaciated bodies, tortured and tormented by the Rākṣasas and enquires of Lord Raṅganātha what He proposes to do with her daughter, as the Lord’s remembrance of the individual in the light of his ultimate redemption, is the only ‘Means’ for his salvation, (see also aphorism 66 of Śrīvacanabhūṣaṇa [Śrīvacanabhūṣaṇam]).




## 7.2.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

என் செய்கின்றாய் என் தாமரைக் கண்ணா! என்னும் கண்ணீர்மல்க இருக்கும்,  
என் செய்கேன் எறிநீர்த் திருவரங்கத்தாய்? என்னும் வெவ்வுயிர்த்துஉயிர்த்து உருகும்:

**English translation of verse 7.2.2:**

“My lotus-eyed Lord, unto me what will you do?”  
Is the question by this lady put, her eyes filled with tears,  
She stands still and queries again, ‘What shall I do  
To get at you, oh, Lord of Tiruvaraṅkam with surging waters?’  
Says she, panting and breathing hot, “Come before me, my past sins,”,  
‘Oh cloud-hued Lord! is this all your mercy?’, unto this girl tense,  
Say what will happen, Oh, Lord, Who the worlds did create,  
Are and spat, spanned and did many such things, them to protect?

**Notes:**

\(i\) The Nāyakī would like to know what those massive sins committed by her, are, which stand between her and the Lord. That only shows, she is painfully conscious of the fact that she has to face the consequences of her past sins, instead of blaming the Lord. But then, the cloud-hued Lord, known for His munificence like the rain-clouds, could, in the exercise of His quality of mercy, wipe off the sins, *in toto*, and in no time.

\(ii\) Breathing hot, the Nāyakī melts under the impact of that heat as if she isn’t there to sigh anymore.

\(iii\) So great is the heat generated by her separation from the Lord that she would like to be thrown by some one into the cool waters of the river Kāvēri in Śrīraṅgam, the river Tāmraparṇi in her birth place having already become hot because of her desolation.




## 7.2.3
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வட்குஇலள் இறையும் மணிவண்ணா! என்னும் வானமே நோக்கும் மையாக்கும்,  
உட்குஉடை அசுரர் உயிர்எல்லாம் உண்ட ஒருவனே! என்னும் உள்உருகும்,

திண்கொடி மதிள்சூழ் திருவரங்கத்தாய்! இவள்திறத்து என் செய்திட்டாயே?

tiṇkoṭi matiḷcūḻ tiruvaraṅkattāy! ivaḷtiṟattu eṉ ceytiṭṭāyē?

**English translation of verse 7.2.3:**

Shaking off all reserve, this lady calls out, “Oh, Lord of sapphire hue,”  
And at the sky gazes, pining for Him unique, Who slew  
The Asuras formidable, thawing down, she prays, “Oh, Lord invisible,  
You did incarnate as Kākuttā (Rama) and Kaṇṇaṉ, make yourself visible  
Unto me now”; Oh, Lord, who in Tiruvaraṅkam does recline,  
The walled city strong, what’s it you have unto this girl done?

**Notes:**

\(i\) The mother is amazed at the complete lack of the innate modesty on the part of her love-intoxicated daughter, her calling out loudly the name of her spouse and that too, the one indicative of His bewitching Form which she ought to enjoy secretly at heart.

\(ii\) The Lord, who slew the Asuras and relieved the distress of the Devas, notoriously selfish, should certainly rush to the aid of the weaker sex, particularly those who cling to His feet under all circumstances.

\(iii\) The upaniṣads state that the Lord will exhibit His exquisite Form and splendour to the subjects of His choice. It is this that emboldens the Nāyakī to call upon Him to appear before her. The Incarnate Forms like Rāma and Kṛṣṇa could, of course, not be seen at all times, they having already gone back to the Celestium. So then, the Āḻvār wants the Lord at Tiruvaraṅkam to appear before him in His iconic Form. Actually, the tough walls of the holy place would seem to extend an invitataion to the devout to come and enjoy the Lord reclining there in His worshippable form all the time, unlike the Lord’s incarnations, the irretrievable past.

\(iv\) The mother wants to know what exactly the Lord had done to bring about this kind of infatuation in her daughter.




## 7.2.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

இட்டகால் இட்ட கையளாய் இருக்கும் எழுந்துஉலாய் மயங்கும் கை கூப்பும்,  
கட்டமே காதல்! என்று மூர்ச்சிக்கும் கடல்வண்ணா! கடியைகாண் என்னும்,  
வட்டவாய் நேமி வலங்கையா! என்னும் வந்திடாய் என்றுஎன்றே மயங்கும்,  
சிட்டனே செழுநீர்த் திருவரங்கத்தாய்! இவள்திறத்து என் சிந்தித்தாயே?

ciṭṭaṉē ceḻunīrt tiruvaraṅkattāy! ivaḷtiṟattu eṉ cintittāyē?

**English translation of verse 7.2.4:**

Sometimes this lady is motionless and she moves about, at times,  
Insensate she remains but still seen with joined palms,  
She swoons, exclaiming, “God-love is indeed hard to endure”;  
Says she, “Oh, sea-hued Lord, You are unto me much too severe”,  
Calling out many a time, Him that wields the discus round  
In His right hand, she faints when He comes not; oh, Lord immaculate.  
Reclining in fertile Tiruvaraṅkam, what is it you do for her contemplate?

**Notes:**

\(i\) The Nāyakī, intoxicated with God-love, exhibits the same behaviour as those struck by Śrī Rāma’s mighty arrows. The targets of those arrows will be severally seen fainting with pain, tortured or running about here and there in great fright. So also, the Nāyakī is at times insensate, sometimes, she moves about here and there agitated, and at other times, feels tortured by the immensity of her God-hunger still remaining unappeased. The Āḻvār, who was hitherto looking upon God-love as an end in itself, now feels it a terrible-tormenter, much beyond his capacity to endure.

\(ii\) The mother’s reference to an Immaculate God is rather ironical. She seems to suggest that, after inflicting all this pain on her daughter, He masquerades as the perfect One, like unto a Brahmin going about chanting Vedas, wearing white sacred thread and twisted Kuśā grass in the fourth finger, the very picture of a perfect Brahmin, after killing several Brahmins.

\(iii\) *Fertile Tiruvaraṅkam*: The mother chides the Lord whether He came down to that cosy place only to sleep away, unmindful of the precarious condition of her daughter and His duty towards her.




## 7.2.5
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

சிந்திக்கும் திசைக்கும் தேறும் கை கூப்பும் திருவரங் கத்துள்ளாய்! என்னும்  
வந்திக்கும், ஆங்கே மழைக் கண்ணீர் மல்க வந்திடாய் என்றுஎன்றே மயங்கும்,  
அந்திப்போது அவுணன் உடல்இடந்தானே! அலை கடல் கடைந்த ஆர்அமுதே,  
சந்தித்து உன் சரணம் சார்வதே வலித்த தையலை மையல் செய்தானே!

vantikkum, āṅkē maḻaik kaṇṇīr malka vantiṭāy eṉṟueṉṟē mayaṅkum,  
antippōtu avuṇaṉ uṭaliṭantāṉē! alai kaṭal kaṭainta āramutē,  
cantittu uṉ caraṇam cārvatē valitta taiyalai maiyal ceytāṉē!

**English translation of verse 7.2.5:**

Oh, Lord, Avuṇaṉ’s body you tore off at twilight,  
You are the Nectar insatiable that churned the ocean,  
You have the heart of this lady stolen,  
With resolve firm to join you and stay at your feet,  
Dwindles she in contemplation of her erstwhile union;  
Suddenly rallies round and with joined palms and head bent,  
She calls out, “Oh, Lord in Tiruvaraṅkam”, and tears from her eyes do rain,  
“You haven’t come, You haven’t come”, she utters and faints.

**Notes:**

\(i\) Turning the searchlight inward, the Nāyakī finds that a soul, badly caught up in the vortex of worldly life, with its terrific involvement in a recurring cycle of birth and death, was attracted by the Lord’s bewitching eyes, had the blissful union with Him for a while, only to be deserted by Him as at present. Contemplating thus, she breaks down and even then, her palms are joined in reverence, a unique feature of hers, under all circumstances.

\(ii\) Despite the Lord having taken up His abode in Tiruvaraṅkam, in His worshippable (Iconic) Form, it is indeed distressing that He hasn’t obliged the Āḻvār with His presence. Did He not assume the Form of Narasinga and keep Himself ready for emergence at the precise moment, where and when His presence would be demanded, all for the sake of the young lad, Prahlāda, son of Avuṇaṉ (Hiraṇya)?

\(iii\) *Stealing the heart of this lady*: It was just because a mere crow inflicted a slight injury son the person of His beloved consort, Śrī Rāma sent ‘Brahmāstra’, a super-missile, in hot pursuit of the little creature, literarally applying heroic remedies for petty maladies. Even so, He took great pains to enthral a petty soul like the Āḻvār’s and the latter gave away her heart unto Him, in sweet contemplation of this great gesture on His part.

\(iv\) The three successive stages of love to God, indicated in this song, are worth noting. These are *Recollection, Trance* and *Rallying—recollection* of all the past ravishments vouchsafed by the benign Lord, trance, fainting in desolation caused by such recollection in the light of the present state of non-enjoyment and *rallying*, that is, the sudden lucidity while in the trance state considered to be very dangerous indeed. The momentary lucidity in a delirious state, is akin to the sudden lighting up of consciousness in a person under the spell of death-coma or the sudden flicker of the dying light. That was the reason why Nañciyar exclaimed, with great fright, when Uyntapiḻlai, cīyar’s disciple, recited this song, “Woe unto her (Saint’s) lucidity! I am undone”.




## 7.2.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

**English translation of verse 7.2.6:**

Please say what this sinner can do unto her daughter,  
Who exclaims, “Oh, you that enticed me and stole my heart,”  
“You that worked many wonders huge,”, “Oh, Araṅkaṉ reclining amid cool waters?”  
“You of sapphire hue, with lips red, Chief of Celestials, wielding weapons hot,”  
And so on, Oh, Lord, reclining on the hooded serpent,

**Note**

The mother says unto Lord Raṅganāthā;

“My daughter keeps wondering how you stole her heart, by engendering in her enormous love, how, during your union with her, you worked many wonders such as exhibiting your loving condescension of amazing magnitude, how you enthralled her by your exquisite physical charm, your red lips and sapphire hue, how you don’t come unto her, although so very near in Tiruvaraṅkam, how your mighty weapons do not cut out her sins, if at all, they do stand between you and her and so on. Should you not be inseparable from my daughter even as you cling to your serpent-bed? How is it you relax yourself on this cosy bed, when my daughter is struggling hard, panting for you, as above? Please say what this sinner (self) witnessing the sad spectacle, can at all do to relieve my daughter’s distress”.




## 7.2.7
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

பால துன்பங்கள் இன்பங்கள் படைத்தாய்! பற்றிலார் பற்றநின்றானே,

**English translation of verse 7.2.7:**

Says my tender darling, her eyes, cool and lovely, filled with tears,  
“Oh, Distributor of weal and woe among your creatures,  
Even unto those who seek not refuge in you, you are the Protector,  
Oh, Controller of the wheel of Time, the Milk-ocean is your abode,  
Oh, sea-hued Lord, Oh, Kaṇṇā, You that in Tiruvaraṅkam do reside,  
Amid cool waters full of fish, You, my Sanctifier, and so on.

**Notes:**

The Nāyakī’s address, as above, quoted by the Mother, when analysed, would reveal her trend of thought as follows:

\(i\) My Lord, You are known to inflict miseries on the ungodly and regale the devout. Perhaps, you have excluded me from the scope of such a dispensation.

\(ii\) My Lord, You carry the credential that you extend protection even to those who do not submit themselves as such to your protection (Aśaraṇya Śaraṇyah) and yet, you torment me like this. Paradoxically, a prickly plant has been glorified as a grand tree, like unto the wish-yielding tree.

\(iii\) Oh, Lord, if you mean to say that the propitious time for my succour has not yet arrived, may I point out to you that time is at your beck and call?

\(iv\) Reference to Lord Raṅganātha, in the midst of cool waters, full of fish, points to the Nāyakī’s incapacity to stay apart from Him even as fish can’t stay out of water. And yet, can He afford to Keep away from the Nāyakī?

\(v\) “*You, my Sanctifier*!” The Lord has instilled in the Nāyakī sanctity, by way of endowing her with the firm conviction that He is her sole Saviour, a belief which remains unshaken, even in the most desperate situation.

\(vi\) *Tender darling* like unto a creeper which can thrive only when it twists round a pole, firm and fixed, like unto the Lord Himself. The mother says, her daughter is shedding tears in plenty, unable to endure her separation from the Lord. Actually, it was on account of His indefatigable efforts that He has been able to induct in her such assiduous love for Him and yet, He would not come and see for Himself, the fruits of His labour!




## 7.2.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கொழுந்து வானவர்கட்கு என்னும் குன்றுஏந்தி கோநிரை காத்தவன்! என்னும்,

**English translation of verse 7.2.8:**

Oh, Lord, reclining in Tiruvaraṅkam amid sacred waters, what shall I do  
For my daughter, like unto Tirumakaḷ, ever calling you,  
‘Oh Chief of Celestials, Oh, Lifter of Mount (Govardhan) and Protector of cows,’?  
With joined palms and tearful eyes, breathing hot she calls,  
‘Oh, dark-hued Lord,’ gazing at the sky she would ask  
How and where indeed she could for you look.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The Nāyakī mentions, side by side, the Lord’s supremacy and simplicity, so that one need not be scared of the former nor be tempted to underrate Him because of the latter;

\(ii\) The mother suggests that the Lord should be inseparably attached to her daughter even as Tirumakaḷ (Mahālakṣmī) inheres in His chest always, brooking no separation;

\(iii\) Not sighting the Lord in the direction she looks up, the Nāyakī would turn behind in the fond hope that He might take her by surpirse, and embrace her from behind.




## 7.2.9
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

என் திருமகள் சேர்மார்வனே! என்னும் என்னுடை ஆவியே! என்னும்,

teṉ tiruvaraṅkam kōyilkoṇṭāṉē! teḷikilēṉ muṭivu ivaḷtaṉakkē. (2)

**English translation of verse 7.2.9:**

Oh, Lord in Teṉtiruvaraṅkam enshrined, ‘tisn’t unto me clear  
What indeed will be the end of this lady’s inordinate longing;  
Calls she, “Oh, my Soul, bearing on Your chest Tirumakaḷ, my Mother,”  
“Oh Spouse of Dame Earth whom You lifted on Your bent tooth long,”  
“Oh, dear One unto the shepherd girl whom you once took over,  
Slaying the unruly bulls seven with the voice of thunder,”

**Notes:**

\(i\) The Nāyakī wonders how she could suffer inspite of Tirumakaḷ (Mahālakṣmī), the unfailing Intercessor between the Lord and His subjects being ever present on His winsome chest. The Lord is the soul of all souls and what is more, the Mother is always in conjunction with Him; here then is a grand setting, the soul of our soul, the super-soul being a mighty combination, highly conducive to our well-being. When Nañcīyar spelt out in one breath, without a break, the first line of this song as in the original text, (third line here), so as to yield this meaning, his preceptor, Parāśara Bhaṭṭar, the high Priest of Lord Raṅganātha, was taking food and listening to the marvellous recital by the inspired Saint. Thrilled by this manner of chanting, with the new light thrown on the text, Bhaṭṭārya stopped eating and reclined in the easy chair, wrapt in rapturous meditation.

This way of addressing God is indeed very fascinating. Tradition has it that the famous Anantāḷvān named his daughter as “My Mother, Lakṣmī” (En Tirumakaḷ) Śrī Parāśara Bhaṭṭar, reputed to be no less than the son of Lord, please consider me as but a part of the bridal outfit of Your consort, Mahālakṣmī, my Mother and also grant that I may love You as the Beloved of my Mother-(Aḷakiya Maṇavāḷa or Lovely Spouse)”.

\(ii\) The Lord can be dear to Mother Earth only if He could take care of her favourities like the Nāyakī.

\(iii\) “Having slain the seven unruly bulls with thunderous voice, for winning the hand of Goddess Nīḷā, incarnated as Nappiṉṉai, the shepherdess, Oh, Lord, you are now relaxing in Tiruvaraṅkam on your serpent-bed. How indeed do you intend to put an end to my daughter’s afflictions?”, asks the gnostic mother of Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī.

**English translation of verse 7.2.10:**

It seemed this lady panting for the Lord wouldn’t attain Him,  
‘I know not the end of my sufferings at all she did exclaim,  
“Oh, Supreme Master of the three worlds,”, “Oh Internal Controller  
Of Śiva wearing on matted locks fragrant flowers  
And Brahmā, the four-headed,” “Oh, Chief of Celestials of like form,”,  
“Oh, generous Tiruvaraṅka,” and so on, but now has she attained  
The lovely feet of the cloud-hued Lord indeed!

\(i\) The mother is mighty glad that her daughter, who was in a hopelessly desperate condition with no prospect of an early end to her sufferings, has, after all, attained the feet of Lord Raṅganātha Who is graciously reclining in Tiruvaraṅkam so as to be worshipped by all down below desirous of beholding and enjoying His exquisite Form, instead of being the close preserve of the denizens in Heaven.

\(ii\) The Celestials in Heaven are endowed with a form like unto the Lord’s own and what is more, the continual stream of joy flowing unto them from the Lord who is an inexhaustible fountain of bliss, is reflected on their person




## 7.2.11
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

முகில்வண்ணன் அடியைஅடைந்து அருள் சூடி உய்ந்தவன் மொய்புனல் பொருநல்,  
துகில்வண்ணத்தூநீர்ச் சேர்ப்பன் வண்பொழில்சூழ் வண்குருகூர்ச் சடகோபன்,  
முகில்வண்ணன் அடிமேல் சொன்னசொல்மாலை ஆயிரத்து இப்பத்தும் வல்லார்,  
முகில்வண்ண வானத்து இமையவர் சூழ இருப்பர் பேரின்ப வெள்ளத்தே (2)

mukilvaṇṇaṉ aṭiyaiaṭaintu aruḷ cūṭi uyntavaṉ moypuṉal porunal,  
tukilvaṇṇattūnīrc cērppaṉ vaṇpoḻilcūḻ vaṇkurukūrc caṭakōpaṉ,  
mukilvaṇṇaṉ aṭimēl coṉṉacolmālai āyirattu ippattum vallār,  
mukilvaṇṇa vāṉattu imaiyavar cūḻa iruppar pēriṉpa veḷḷattē (2)

**English translation of verse 7.2.11:**

Those that are well-versed in these songs ten,  
Out of the choice thousand, composed in adoration  
Of (Lord Raṅganātha) the cloud-hued Lord, by Caṭakōpaṉ  
Of fertile Kurukūr on the bank of Porunal, the river sacred,  
Who the cloud-hued Lord attained and was by His grace salved,  
Will be by Celestials surrounded in High Heaven  
And immersed in eternal joy remain.

**Note**

It is quite clear from this song that the entire hymnal, comprising a thousand songs, is in adoration of Lord Raṅganātha, enshrined in Tiruvaraṅkam (Śrīraṅgam in Tamilnadu). The invocatory song (serial number 4), cited at the beginning of this hymnal, also highlights this fact. No doubt, particular decads have been dedicated to the Lord enshrined in other pilgrim centres as well. This is like portions from the main dedication, doled out like holy food first offered to Lord Raṅganātha being divided out and distributed among the minor deities in the chapels around, as Nampiḷḷai would put it.
