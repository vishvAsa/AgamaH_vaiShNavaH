## 00 Intro6.1
We saw in the preceding centum from V-7 and onwards the Āḻvār seeking refuge in successive Pilgrim centres, at the feet of the Lord enshrined there. If the surrender at the feet of the Lord which should yield the result as a matter of course, did not meet with immediate response from the Lord, it was because He willed that the contemporary world as well as posterity should benefit through the Āḻvār’s scintillating hymns flowing from his sweet lips. It is indeed our great good fortune that the Āḻvār was not immediately lifted up to Heaven. In V-10, the Alvar prayed intensely for the acceleration of his union with the Lord and now he seeks out the Lord at Tiruvaṇvaṇṭūr, a pilgrim centre in Keralā, but is too feeble to reach that place. The next best he could do in such a forlorn state, was to acquaint the Lord with his critical condition through some one. The Āḻvār, once again, gets tran-formed as a Nāyakī and sends some birds and bees to convey her message to the Lord. The birds, with their pair of wings, typify the devout, endowed with *great knowledge* and *good conduct*, the efficient Preceptors, with a happy blending of these two essential requisites, for serving as an effective medium between Man and God.

This technique of the Āḻvār sending messages to the Lord through birds, bees etc., has already been elaborated upon, vide preamble to 1-4. There are four decads, in the whole work, where such messages are sent, the other three being I-4, VI-8 and IX-7. Whereas the message in I-4 was sent to the Lord in His ‘Vyūha’ aspect at the Milky ocean, the seat of His creative activity, the present one is held to have been addressed to the Lord in His ‘Vibhava’ or Incarnate Forms. As the message is being sent to the Lord in His ‘Arca’ (Iconic) Form at Tiruvaṇvaṇṭūr, it might be questioned how the Āḻvār is stated to have sent emissaries to the Lord in His Incarnate Forms. The clue for this can be had from the tenth stanza of this decad, where the Āḻvār specifically mentions Śrī Rāma, stationed at that pilgrim centre. Further, the message in the last of the four decads, referred to above, namely, IX 7, is addressed to the Lord in His *Arca* (Iconic) Form and there is hardly any need for duplication in this regard. In 1-4, the Āḻvār invoked the Lord’s special trait of forgiveness, while, in this decad, the accent is on His pledge, the creed of extending protection to His devotees, seeking Him ardently, vide also aphorism 156 of ‘Ācārya Hṛdayaṃ’




## 6.1.1
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வைகல் பூங் கழிவாய் வந்து மேயும் குருகினங்காள்  
செய் கொள் செந்நெல் உயர் திருவண்வண்டூர் உறையும்  
கை கொள் சக்கரத்து என் கனிவாய்ப் பெருமானைக் கண்டு  
கைகள் கூப்பி சொல்லீர் வினையாட்டியேன் காதன்மையே. (2)

vaikal pūṅ kaḻivāy vantu mēyum kurukiṉaṅkāḷ  
cey koḷ cennel uyar tiruvaṇvaṇṭūr uṟaiyum  
kai koḷ cakkarattu eṉ kaṉivāyp perumāṉaik kaṇṭu  
kaikaḷ kūppi collīr viṉaiyāṭṭiyēṉ kātaṉmaiyē. (2)

**English translation of verse 6.1.1:**

Ye herds of Heron, always seeking food in water-logged land!  
Go unto my Lord with fruit like lips and discus in hand.  
Who does for ever in Tiruvaṇvaṇṭūr reside,  
Where there are plenty of rich paddy fields;  
And convey the depth of this sinner’s love, with your hands, folded.

### Notes

\(i\) The Nāyakī describes the place to which the herons have to go and the hard hearted Lord to whom they have to report her unique love, emanating from a tender heart. The description of the destination should indeed tempt the birds, for there too, they can have plenty of food. Hard-hearted though He might be, the Nāyakī cannot lift her mind from His fascinating lips and that too, on the heels of her enjoyment of Kṛṣṇāvatāra, in the immediately preceding decad.

\(ii\) The inner meaning of this song, as brought out in aphorism 154 of ‘Ācārya Hṛdayaṃ!’ is given below:

An Ācārya (Preceptor) of spotless purity in and out, who revels in God-enjoyment in the company of his inseparable disciples and attends pious gatherings along with them, is being sought out, as an efficient medium for securing communion with the Lord.

\(iii\) The Āḻvār, who had tasted the Lord’s condescending love and amazing simplicity during those blissful moments of union with Him, is now inclined to disdain Him for His aloofness, the predominant trait of His transcendent (Paratva) aspect. This is reflected in her warning to the birds to approach the Lord with folded hands, with due regard to His might and majesty.




## 6.1.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

காதல் மென் பெடையோடு உடன் மேயும் கரு நாராய்  
வேத வேள்வி ஒலி முழங்கும் தண் திருவண்வண்டூர்  
நாதன் ஞாலம் எல்லாம் உண்ட நம் பெருமானைக் கண்டு  
பாதம் கைதொழுது பணியீர் அடியேன் திறமே.

kātal meṉ peṭaiyōṭu uṭaṉ mēyum karu nārāy  
vēta vēḷvi oli muḻaṅkum taṇ tiruvaṇvaṇṭūr  
nātaṉ ñālam ellām uṇṭa nam perumāṉaik kaṇṭu  
pātam kaitoḻutu paṇiyīr aṭiyēṉ tiṟamē.

**English translation of verse 6.1.2:**

Oh, Stork of complexion fine, move you do in search of food,  
With your beloved mate; go and report my condition, with hands folded.  
Unto my Lord, Master of the Universe, Who sustained the worlds  
During deluge and now in cool Tiruvaṇvaṇṭūr resides  
Amid vedic chantings and rituals with a flourish of trumpets loud.

### Notes

\(i\) The Nāyakī is commissioning a stork to go and reverently report her condition at the feet of the Lord who stands pledged to redeem His ardent votaries, but now remains wholly absorbed in the vedic chantings and rituals put through with great eclat in Tiruvaṇvaṇṭūr by its pious brahmins. It is said of Śrī Rāma that He would be present wherever vedic chantings and ritualistic proceedings were going on.

\(ii\) It is noteworthy that the Nāyakī advises her emissary to prostrate at the feet of the Lord. This could either reflect her attitude, already commented upon, in para (iii) of the notes below the preceding song or stress the correct code of conduct. It is no use paying obeisance without actually prostrating before the worship-worthy. The great Nañcīyar used to say: “Whenever I saw a devotee of Viṣṇu and I fell at his feet with my head touching them, it was only then, I felt as if I ate my fill and all my hunger vanished”.




## 6.1.3
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

திறங்கள் ஆகி எங்கும் செய்கள் ஊடு உழல் புள்ளினங்காள்  
சிறந்த செல்வம் மல்கு திருவண்வண்டூர் உறையும்  
கறங்கு சக்கரக் கைக் கனிவாய்ப் பெருமானைக் கண்டு  
இறங்கி நீர் தொழுது பணியீர் அடியேன் இடரே

tiṟaṅkaḷ āki eṅkum ceykaḷ ūṭu uḻal puḷḷiṉaṅkāḷ  
ciṟanta celvam malku tiruvaṇvaṇṭūr uṟaiyum  
kaṟaṅku cakkarak kaik kaṉivāyp perumāṉaik kaṇṭu  
iṟaṅki nīr toḻutu paṇiyīr aṭiyēṉ iṭarē

**English translation of verse 6.1.3:**

Ye, birds flocking together all over the flush fields,  
Go and submit at the feet of my red-lipped Lord, Who wields  
The revolving discus and in Tiruvaṇvaṇṭūr resides,  
The abode of riches in plenty, how in misery this vassal fades.

### Note

It is the natural habit of the birds to flock together and go hither and thither, in search of food but the God-infatuated Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī thinks that they are also moving about in search of God, out of consideration for her. c.f. 11-1. She tells the birds that the Lord whom they are after, resides in Tiruvaṇvaṇṭūr and advises them to go and meet Him there and, after making a low obeisance to Him, reverently report her miserable condition also. The birds ask the Nāyakī how the Lord could stay at that centre, forgetting all about her and the Nāyakī clarifies at once that it is the immense wealth of the place that has kept Him engrossed with it. whereas for her there is no greater wealth than her Lord, the ‘Śṛya śṛyaṃ’.




## 6.1.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

இடர் இல் போகம் மூழ்கி இணைந்து ஆடும் மட அன்னங்காள்!  
விடல் இல் வேத ஒலி முழங்கும் தண் திருவண்வண்டூர்  
கடலின் மேனிப்பிரான் கண்ணனை நெடுமாலைக் கண்டு  
உடலம் நைந்து ஒருத்தி உருகும் என்று உணர்த்துமினே

iṭar il pōkam mūḻki iṇaintu āṭum maṭa aṉṉaṅkāḷ!  
viṭal il vēta oli muḻaṅkum taṇ tiruvaṇvaṇṭūr  
kaṭaliṉ mēṉippirāṉ kaṇṇaṉai neṭumālaik kaṇṭu  
uṭalam naintu orutti urukum eṉṟu uṇarttumiṉē

**English translation of verse 6.1.4:**

Ye, modest swans, in joy immersed and to misery unknown!  
Go and meet the Lord Supreme, the sea-hued Benefactor great,  
Who, in cool Tiruvaṇvaṇṭūr resides, where do reverberate  
Vedic chantings and report, ‘Here’s a woman dwindling down’.

**Notes:**

Addressing the swans who always move in strength and have never, therefore, known the pangs of separation from each other, the Nāyakī asks them to go to Tiruvaṇvaṇṭūr and tell her Lord that here, at this end, is a woman languishing miserably, due to separation from Him.

The swans, immersed in joy and flocking together, denote those in incessant communion with the Lord, speaking the same language (*i.e*.) the language of rapturous devotion, as the Āḻvārs did.




## 6.1.5
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

உணர்த்தல் ஊடல் உணர்ந்து உடன் மேயும் மட அன்னங்காள்  
திணர்த்த வண்டல்கள்மேல் சங்கு சேரும் திருவண்வண்டூர்  
புணர்த்த பூந் தண் துழாய்முடி நம் பெருமானைக் கண்டு  
புணர்த்த கையினராய் அடியேனுக்கும் போற்றுமினே

uṇarttal ūṭal uṇarntu uṭaṉ mēyum maṭa aṉṉaṅkāḷ  
tiṇartta vaṇṭalkaḷmēl caṅku cērum tiruvaṇvaṇṭūr  
puṇartta pūn taṇ tuḻāymuṭi nam perumāṉaik kaṇṭu  
puṇartta kaiyiṉarāy aṭiyēṉukkum pōṟṟumiṉē

**English translation of verse 6.1.5:**

Ye, inseparable swans, against the ill-effects of separation forewarned!  
Go to our Sire, with cool tuḻacī garland on His crown adorned,  
Who resides in Tiruvaṇvaṇṭūr, on whose soft sands  
Conches converge and worship Him, on my behalf also, with folded hands.

### Notes

\(i\) Estrangement on some slight pretext, followed by reconciliation, culminating in union between the lover and the beloved, are factors which commonly characterise connubial relationship. The swans, moving always together, do not, however, have to pass through these vicissitudes.

\(ii\) The Nāyakī’s request to the swans to worship the Lord on her behalf as well and sing the song of benediction unto Him, sets the pace for those who are not fortunate enough to visit the various pilgrim centres but keenly miss the bliss. These persons request the fortunate visitors to those places to worship on their behalf also. It is not exactly worship by proxy but the expression of one’s yearning for worship.




## 6.1.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

போற்றி யான் இரந்தேன் புன்னைமேல் உறை பூங் குயில்காள்  
சேற்றில் வாளை துள்ளும் திருவண்வண்டூர் உறையும்  
ஆற்றல் ஆழி அங்கை அமரர் பெருமானைக் கண்டு  
மாற்றம் கொண்டருளீர் மையல் தீர்வது ஒருவண்ணமே

pōṟṟi yāṉ irantēṉ puṉṉaimēl uṟai pūṅ kuyilkāḷ  
cēṟṟil vāḷai tuḷḷum tiruvaṇvaṇṭūr uṟaiyum  
āṟṟal āḻi aṅkai amarar perumāṉaik kaṇṭu  
māṟṟam koṇṭaruḷīr maiyal tīrvatu oruvaṇṇamē

**English translation of verse 6.1.6:**

I pray unto ye, lovely koels, dwelling up the laurel trees,  
To meet the Lord of the Celestials, wielding the powerful discus  
Who, in Tiruvaṇvaṇṭūr resides, where revel the fishes  
In marshy lands and bring unto me heartening news.

**Note**

*Up the laurel trees*: The laurel (Puṉṉai in Tamil) tree on the west bank of the sacred tank within the precincts of the Temple of Lord Raṅganātha has come in for special mention in Śloka 49 of the first centum of ‘Śrī Raṅgarāja Stavaṃ’ of Śrī Parāśara Bhaṭṭar. It is said to have imbibed the fragrance of Tiruvāymoḻi. This goes to show that generations of devotees have sat under the shade of this ancient tree and reverently chanted Tiruvāymoḻi and delved into its inner meanings, discoursing on them. In this process, all the aroma emanating from those recitals and discourses attached itself to the tree, providing it first class nourishment too. It is very likely that the sweet-voiced birds (Koels), resting on the laurel tree, refer to these very devotees.




## 6.1.7
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஒருவண்ணம் சென்று புக்கு எனக்கு ஒன்று உரை ஒண் கிளியே  
செரு ஒண் பூம் பொழில் சூழ் செக்கர் வேலைத் திருவண்வண்டூர்  
கரு வண்ணம் செய்யவாய் செய்ய கண் செய்ய கை செய்யகால்  
செரு ஒண் சக்கரம் சங்கு அடையாளம் திருந்தக் கண்டே.

oruvaṇṇam ceṉṟu pukku eṉakku oṉṟu urai oṇ kiḷiyē  
ceru oṇ pūm poḻil cūḻ cekkar vēlait tiruvaṇvaṇṭūr  
karu vaṇṇam ceyyavāy ceyya kaṇ ceyya kai ceyyakāl  
ceru oṇ cakkaram caṅku aṭaiyāḷam tiruntak kaṇṭē.

**English translation of verse 6.1.7:**

Lovely parrot! whatever be the odds you should find your way  
To Tiruvaṇvaṇṭūr of red soil with flower gardens lovely and say  
Just one word on my behalf unto my Lord of dark hue,  
Lips, eyes, hands and feet, all red, holding the discus bright  
And the conch ins parable, spotting Him well from these clues.

**Note**

The parrot signifies the Preceptors, true and steadfast, who faithfully pass on the learning gathered by them from their masters, without deviation or distortion. The parrot is known to repeat just what it hears. The parrot in question is advised by the Nāyakī to somehow reach the intended destination turning a blind eye to the enchanting scenery *en route*, lest it should succumb to the way-side attractions. Even at that end, the emissary shall, for her sake, submit to indignity, if any, heaped on it, such as caning etc., by way of denying it access to the Sovereign Lord. By rendering service to the Nāyakī, the emissary will be the first beneficiary the immediate recipient of the Lord’s favours, much ahead of the Nāyakī herself, even as Hanumān, on his return from his pioneering visit to Laṅkā, got himself locked in Lord Rāma’s sweet embrace (paṛṣvaṅgo Hanūmataḥ), a month ahead of Sītā’s reunion with the Lord.




## 6.1.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

திருந்தக் கண்டு எனக்கு ஒன்று உரையாய் ஒண் சிறு பூவாய்  
செருந்தி ஞாழல் மகிழ் புன்னை சூழ் தண் திருவண்வண்டூர்  
பெரும் தண் தாமரைக்கண் பெரு நீள் முடி நால் தடந்தோள்  
கருந் திண் மா முகில் போல் திருமேனி அடிகளையே

tiruntak kaṇṭu eṉakku oṉṟu uraiyāy oṇ ciṟu pūvāy  
cerunti ñāḻal makiḻ puṉṉai cūḻ taṇ tiruvaṇvaṇṭūr  
perum taṇ tāmaraikkaṇ peru nīḷ muṭi nāl taṭantōḷ  
karun tiṇ mā mukil pōl tirumēṉi aṭikaḷaiyē

**English translation of verse 6.1.8:**

You lovely little Pūvāi, go and see closely you should,  
My cloud-hued Lord with lotus eyes, cool and broad,  
Huge crown and hefty shoulders four, Who does reside  
In cool Tiruvaṇvaṇṭūr, by lovely trees surrounded  
And about Him come and tell me a nice word.

### Note

Unless the emissary is a keen observer, he can’t be an effective messenger. The Nāyakī wants the little lovely bird to have a close look at the Lord in Tiruvaṇvaṇṭūr in all details and narrate to her what the little one saw. This is one way of the God-lover sustaining herself.




## 6.1.9
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அடிகள் கைதொழுது அலர்மேல் அசையும் அன்னங்காள்  
விடிவை சங்கு ஒலிக்கும் திருவண்வண்டூர் உறையும்  
கடிய மாயன் தன்னை கண்ணனை நெடுமாலைக் கண்டு  
கொடிய வல்வினையேன் திறம் கூறுமின் வேறுகொண்டே

aṭikaḷ kaitoḻutu alarmēl acaiyum aṉṉaṅkāḷ  
viṭivai caṅku olikkum tiruvaṇvaṇṭūr uṟaiyum  
kaṭiya māyaṉ taṉṉai kaṇṇaṉai neṭumālaik kaṇṭu  
koṭiya valviṉaiyēṉ tiṟam kūṟumiṉ vēṟukoṇṭē

**English translation of verse 6.1.9:**

Ye, swans, gliding gently on flowers! report you should  
About this fell sinner, in secret and with joined palms,  
At the feet of Kaṇṇaṉ, my wondrous Lord of love supreme  
Unto devotees, Who does in Tiruvaṇvaṇṭūr always reside  
Where, at day-break, sweet strains from the conch could be heard.

**Notes:**

*In Secret*:

When the Lord is alone with His consort, all the attendants having dispersed after discharging their respective duties.

*At the feet*.

Getting hold of the Lord’s feet is the surest way of evoking




## 6.1.10
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வேறுகொண்டு உம்மை யான் இரந்தேன் வெறி வண்டினங்காள்  
தேறு நீர்ப் பம்பை வடபாலைத் திருவண்வண்டூர்  
மாறு இல் போர் அரக்கன் மதிள் நீறு எழச் செற்று உகந்த  
ஏறு சேவகனார்க்கு என்னையும் உளள் என்மின்களே

vēṟukoṇṭu ummai yāṉ irantēṉ veṟi vaṇṭiṉaṅkāḷ  
tēṟu nīrp pampai vaṭapālait tiruvaṇvaṇṭūr  
māṟu il pōr arakkaṉ matiḷ nīṟu eḻac ceṟṟu ukanta  
ēṟu cēvakaṉārkku eṉṉaiyum uḷaḷ eṉmiṉkaḷē

**English translation of verse 6.1.10:**

You, sweet-smelling bees, with great respect do I entreat  
That unto Him (Lord Rāma) of valour great, Who did the ramparts rout  
Of the mighty demon and now has His abode  
In Tiruvaṇvaṇṭūr, north of river Pampai, with its waters limpid,  
You do resort and say, here languishes one of His wards.

### Note

The Nāyakī has all along been commissioning different birds to convey her message to the Lord, but now she reverently approaches the bees, even as Śrī Rāma chose Hanumān for the special assignment of handing over His ring to Sītā. The Nāyakī requests the bees to tell Śrī Rāma that He should not rest on His oars with an air of complacence that He has already done everything for Sītā and through her, for her tribe, as a whole; actually, she (Nāyakī) is languishing here, at this end, although she is also one of His many wards.




## 6.1.11
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மின் கொள் சேர் புரிநூல் குறள் ஆய் அகல் ஞாலம் கொண்ட  
வன் கள்வன் அடிமேல் குருகூர்ச் சடகோபன் சொன்ன  
பண் கொள் ஆயிரத்துள் இவை பத்தும் திருவண்வண்டூர்க்கு

iṉkoḷ pāṭal vallār mataṉar miṉṉiṭai yavarkkē (2)

**English translation of verse 6.1.11:**

Those that chant these songs ten, highly delicious,  
Which unto Tiruvaṇvaṇṭūr pertain, out of the mellifluous  
Thousand, composed by Caṭakōpaū of Kurukūr, adoring the feet  
Of the Lord, Who, as Vāmana, wearing on His person radiant.  
The sacred thread charming, took (from Bali) on the sly, the worlds.  
Will unto the Lord be dear like the lovers unto their beloveds.

### Note

The chanters of this decad will be coveted by the Lord and His devotees, the Apsarās in Heaven.
