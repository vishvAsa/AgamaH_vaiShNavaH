## 00 Intro7.5
The Āḻvār, who revelled in the last decad, recounting some of the Lord’s glorious deeds, cites some more achievements of the Lord’s glorious deeds, cites some more achievements of the Lord in this decad, much to his own delectation. At the same time, he could not help wondering how the worldlings, whose birthright it is to share this enjoyment, kept aloof and he even felt vexed with them for their callous indifference. What a pity! Oblivious of the huge treasure of gold, buried within inches right in the centre courtyard of their houses, these folks struggle elsewhere with swollen feet in search of fleeting wealth of no consequence.




## 7.5.1
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நல்பால் அயோத்தியில் வாழும் சராசரம் முற்றவும்,

pulpā mutalā puleṟumpuāti oṉṟuiṉṟiyē,  
nalpāl ayōttiyil vāḻum carācaram muṟṟavum,  
nalpālukku uyttaṉaṉ nāṉmuka ṉārpeṟṟa nāṭṭuḷē? (2)

**English translation of verse 7.5.1:**

Will those in quest of Knowledge seek to Know any but Irāmapirāṉ,  
Who did instil love great for Him even in the smallest ant  
And tiny grass in Ayōtti, the blessed city (with God-love rampant),  
Things still and mobile, with no effort on their part,  
Of all the places in this world, created by Nāṉmukaṉ?

**Notes:**

\(i\) When *Irāmapirāṉ* (Śrī Rāma) went into exile, even inanimate things got choked with grief, the trees withered away, the tanks and rivers boiled up to such an extent that none could go near them. And when He returned to Ayodhyā at the end of His exile, the trees started yielding fruits out of season, the orchards were all in full blossom, betokening the exuberance of their joy over the Lord’s home-coming. Such was the great spell of love cast upon all things, still and mobile, and all creatures in the blessed Kingdom of Ayodhā, by Lord Rāma! It has to be noted that this God-love of amazing magnitude was generated in them by the Lord’s spontaneous grace, without any effort on their part such as pursuing the paths of discipline laid down by the Śastras for cultivationg it. This aspect has been dwelt upon in aphorism 105 of ‘Ācārya Hṛdayam’ with the Author’s characteristic profundity. Even trees and animals were spell-bound, when the Lord, during His next Avatāra as Kṛṣṇa, produced sweet strains from His magic flute.

\(ii\) In his ‘Dramiḍopaniṣad tātparya Ratnāvali’ Śrī Vedānta Deśika, however, interprets this song, as referring to final emancipation of all things and beings in Ayodhya, due solely to Śrī Rāma’s voluntary grace. “Śākethe muktidhānāt”. All the other glossators, except the author of the twelve thousand grantha commentary, hold that this song highlights Lord Rāma’s extraordinary grace in investing the creatures in Ayodhyā with an abundance of God-love, matching with that of the denizens in the High Heaven. Nāṉmukaṉ (Brahmā) is the demi-urge nominated by the Supreme Lord for carrying out the function of creation. Even so, in the worlds created by him there was just one place known as Ayodhyā where all creatures, including the tiniest of beings and things like the ants and grass, were soaked exclusively in love for Lord Rāma, instead of being dependent on Brahmā, the ostensible Creator. Among the living creatures, the ant is the smallest and the grass is the tiniest among things, still and immobile. Mention of these two in this song, goes to emphasise that it is not one’s spiritual learning and deep erudition that secure the final goal of ‘Mokṣa’ but the Lord’s sweet to spontaneous grace and ‘apratiṣedha’ or non-resistance the influx of His grace, on the part of the beneficiaries. Of all places within the ambit of creation of that functionary, known as Brahmā, there is just one, called Ayodhyā where all things and beings from the highest to the lowest, subsist on God-love a passionate love for Śrī Rāma, in total replacement of the normal source of sustenance, namely, food. And, therefore, can one long to know of any but Lord Rāma who instilled such love out of His sweet, spontaneous grace?

\(iii\) Among our Pūrvācāryas (Great Preceptors), Kūrattāḻvāṉ felt that the perfections and graces of Godship were complete in His incarnation as Rāma, eclipsing the glories of all the other Avatāras of the Lord. Bhaṭṭārya, the illustrious son of the illustrious father, had also a distinct predilection for Rāmāvatāra, before whom all the other Avatāras paled into insignificance, according to him. One day, he reacted sharply to the observation made by one Ciriāttāṉ that Lord Rāma did not display the virtue of condescension (Saulabhya) to the remarkable extent displayed by Lord Kṛṣṇa by running an errand, on behalf of the Pāṇḍavas like unto a carrier-pigeon. Bhaṭṭārya stoutly defended his own position, saying: “It is not so; Rāma would have certainly been prepared to go as a messenger but there was none to bid him to carry any message”.




## 7.5.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நாட்டில் பிறந்தவர் நாரணற்கு ஆள்அன்றி ஆவரோ,  
நாட்டில் பிறந்து படாதன பட்டு மனிசர்க்காய்,  
நாட்டை நலியும் அரக்கரை நாடித் தடிந்திட்டு,  
நாட்டை அளித்துஉய்யச் செய்து நடந்தமை கேட்டுமே?

nāṭṭil piṟantavar nāraṇaṟku āḷaṉṟi āvarō,  
nāṭṭil piṟantu paṭātaṉa paṭṭu maṉicarkkāy,  
nāṭṭai naliyum arakkarai nāṭit taṭintiṭṭu,  
nāṭṭai aḷittuuyyac ceytu naṭantamai kēṭṭumē?

**English translation of verse 7.5.2:**

Will those that to the land belong (where reigns supreme  
The Lord’s glory), be the vassal of any one but (Him) Nāraṇar  
Even after knowing how He unto this wicked land came  
And suffered miseries untold for the sake of the humans,  
Tormented by the Rākṣasas, how He sought and routed them,  
Restoring peace and piety in the land and went back to the Celestium?

**Notes:**

\(i\) Śrī Rāma stayed in this land for eleven thousand years although He slew Rāvaṇa and vanquished the monstrous hordes under him in His thirty-eighth year itself. During this long period, the Kingdom of Ayodhyā became saturated with love for Him and the subjects looked upon Him as their sole sustainer. No wonder, when He went back to the Celestium, He took them all with Him.

\(ii\) In the text of this song, Rāma is referred to as Nārāyaṇa (Nāraṇaṉ) being an incarnation of the latter. After the overthrow of Rāvaṇa, Brahmā, Rudra and other Celestials assembled in outer space and sang Śrī Rāma’s praise in a chorus, when they said ‘Bhavān Nārāyaṇo Devaḥ’ etc. Brahmā requested Rāma to get back to the Celestium just then, but Rudra referred to by Vālmīki, as “Śaḍartha nayana Śrīmān” pleaded that He should deign to get back to Ayodhyā and restore happiness to His mothers, brothers and the subjects pining for Him and nurture them with His loving grace.

\(iii\) Wasn’t it His condescending love and deep concern for the sorrowing mortals, down below, sunk in deep distress, that made Him come down to this hideous land which is abhorred even by us, mortals bound by Karma, and stay in the mother’s womb for full twelve months, a couple of months more than we do? And what more? No human ever suffered like Him, His separation from Sītā, His beloved Consort, like unto the Soul remaining on one side of the ocean and the body, on the other, loss of jaṭāyu, the vulture King, extremely dear unto Him etc., etc., and yet these very men for whom He underwent all the harrowing hardships are so ungrateful as to criticise and find fault with Him at this distance of time. Even the Devas, who would not deign to step on to this loathsmoe [loathsome?] soil and receive the libations offered to them by we men and over here, only from a distance, had no compunction while requesting the Lord to come down to Earth and slay Rāvaṇa, King of Laṅkā and rout the city. So very selfish, these Devas are.




## 7.5.3
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கேட்பார்கள் கேசவன் கீர்த்திஅல்லால் மற்றும் கேட்பரோ,  
கேட்பார் செவிசுடு கீழ்மை வசைவுகளே வையும்,  
சேண்பால் பழம்பகைவன் சிசு பாலன், திருவடி  
தாள்பால் அடைந்த தன்மை அறிவாரை அறிந்துமே?

kēṭpārkaḷ kēcavaṉ kīrttiallāl maṟṟum kēṭparō,  
kēṭpār cevicuṭu kīḻmai vacaivukaḷē vaiyum,  
cēṇpāl paḻampakaivaṉ cicu pālaṉ, tiruvaṭi  
tāḷpāl aṭainta taṉmai aṟivārai aṟintumē?

**English translation of verse 7.5.3:**

Will those that yearn to listen to things great  
Listen to aught but the glory of Kēcavaṉ from those  
That know how He got restored unto His feet  
Even Śiśupāla, the age-long enemy inveterate, who railed abuses  
On Him, so vile and mean, that even those who longed  
To hear Him maligned found them unsavoury and blistering?

**Notes:**

What is there to hear but the glory of the magnanimous Lord Kṛṣṇa (Keśava) who salved even the malicious Śiśupāla, His sworn enemy, whose sole occupation it was to vituperate Him in the meanest terms, from those who have already got to know about it? Even while abusing, Śiśupāla chose Lord Kṛṣṇa as his target, keeping Him in view and mentioning His name all the time, though in bad light. The felon did so not only in one birth but in every one of his many births. And what about the intensity of his hatred for the Lord? Even those, who longed to hear the Lord maligned and hired out persons for this job, could not stand the blistering invectives of Śiśupāla. The merciful Lord perhaps took this as yet another form of recital of His names, ‘Nāma Saṅkīrtana’ and salved the age-long offender! So then, even enmity to God is preferred to friendship with Satan, seeing that Śiśupāla could obtain salvation, although he was a staunch hater of Lord Kṛṣṇa, reciting His holy names by way of malicious indictment, though coming face to face with His bejewelled Person, *the great fortune of a great enemy*! And what to say of the infiniteness of His grace, much beyond the competence of we mortals to conjecture! The Lord’s grace is all the more pronounced, seeing that Śiśupāla had, on his part, not even the remotest wish (arthitva) for salvation and it is incredible that he could ever attain it.




## 7.5.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

தன்மை அறிபவர் தாம் அவற்கு ஆள்அன்றி ஆவரோ,  
பன்மைப் படர்பொருள் ஆதும்இல்பாழ் நெடும்காலத்து,  
நன்மைப் புனல்பண்ணி நான்முகனைப்பண்ணி தன்னுள்ளே

naṉmaip puṉalpaṇṇi nāṉmukaṉaippaṇṇi taṉṉuḷḷē  
toṉmai mayakkiya tōṟṟiya cūḻalkaḷ cintittē?

**English translation of verse 7.5.4:**

Will those, that meditate on the grace galore of the Lord,  
Become the vassals of any but Him who put back the worlds  
In positions, as of old, creating the beneficent water first,  
And Brahmā, the four-headed, next, finding all things lost  
For a whole eternity, in a state of veritable naught,  
When one thing could not from another be told, in His stomach caught?

**Notes:**

We can’t but belong to the Supreme, Lord, our Sole Master, the first cause of all things, who created the worlds of differences, with their assortments as Devas, humans, birds and beasts, plants and things, still and mobile. It was indeed His grace galore that made Him sustain in His stomach all the worlds with their varied contents, without their being swept off, during the Great deluge (Mahāpralaya), a state of virtual non-existence or nothingness, pending the restoration of the old order of things in due course when He put them back in position. Is there any need then to specifically state that we can’t but belong to Him, our creator?




## 7.5.5
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

சூழல்கள் சிந்திக்கில் மாயன் கழல்அன்றி சூழ்வரோ,  
ஆழப் பெரும்புனல் தன்னுள் அழுந்திய ஞாலத்தைத்,  
தாழப் படாமல் தன் பால்ஒரு கோட்டிடைத் தான்கொண்ட,

tāḻap paṭāmal taṉ pāloru kōṭṭiṭait tāṉkoṇṭa,  
kēḻal tiruuruāyiṟṟuk kēṭṭum uṇarntumē?

**English translation of verse 7.5.5:**

Will those who seek the means to achieve their ends  
Lean on aught but the feet of the wondrous Lord,  
Having (from sages) heard and pondered how He pulled  
The Earth out from the depth of the water vast,  
As the Great Boar, on His tooth unique, well in tact?

**Notes:**

Once we get to know the Lord’s grace galore and ponder over it, the manner in which He created the worlds and later, preserved them from being swept off by the deep waters of the Deluge, does it not behove us to look upon Him as our Sole Refuge? When He forked the Earth out, effortlessly on His long tusk, bent and protruding, it looked like a blue gem, at one end of the tooth. It was indeed the Lord’s extra-ordinary grace that induced Him to assume a Form out of all proportion to the actual needs, like unto a generous host out to feed a bare forty persons, cooking for a hundred.




## 7.5.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கேட்டும் உணர்ந்தவர் கேசவற்கு ஆள்அன்றி ஆவரோ,  
வாட்டம்இலா வண்கை மாவலி வாதிக்க வாதிப்புண்டு,  
ஈட்டம்கொள் தேவர்கள் சென்றுஇரந்தார்க்கு இடர் நீக்கிய,

īṭṭamkoḷ tēvarkaḷ ceṉṟuirantārkku iṭar nīkkiya,  
kōṭṭuaṅkai vāmaṉaṉāy ceyta kūttukkaḷ kaṇṭumē?

**English translation of verse 7.5.6:**

The Devās, tormented by Māvali, the donor great with devilish pride filled,  
Did the Lord entreat to rid them of their pain extreme;  
Wonders He then performed and the donor’s pride He quelled,  
As Vāmaṉaṉ, with outstretched arms, seeking the queer kind of alms;  
Having all these from the great sages heard  
And pondered over, how can one submit to any but Kēcavaṉ, my Lord?

**Notes:**

If Māvali (Mahābali) was a peerless donor, the Lord too went to him as a peerless Seeker of alms! It was Bali’s infliction of unbearable miseries on the Devas, big and small, which made the otherwise discordant team (cutting at each other’s throat, one chopping the head of another, like unto the land-lords envious of the greatness of one another) combine together and appeal at the feet of Lord Mahāviṣṇu.




## 7.5.7
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கண்டும் தெளிந்தும் கற்றார் கண்ணற்கு ஆளன்றி ஆவரோ,  
வண்டுஉண் மலர்த்தொங்கல் மார்க்கண்டேயனுக்கு வாழும்நாள்  
இண்டைச் சடைமுடி ஈசன்உடன்கொண்டு உசாச்செல்ல,

koṇṭuaṅku taṉṉoṭum koṇṭu uṭaṉceṉṟatu uṇarntumē?

**English translation of verse 7.5.7:**

Ican, with matted locks pronounced, led the little lad,  
Mārkaṇṭēyaṉ, with lovely garland bedecked, unto the Lord,  
Who blessed the youngster with long life and unto His fold  
Admitted him; having heard all these by the great sages told,  
Will those that ponder over the Lord’s grace galore  
Adore any but Kaṇṇaṉ, with their vision clear?

**Notes:**

In the preceding song, Indra and other Devas who sought refuge in the Lord, were blessed by Him. But that is nothing when compared with His shedding grace on Mārkaṇṭēya, a votary of Śiva. Here then is yet another poof of the Lord’s infinite grace. As regards Mārkaṇṭēyā’s episode and the relative role of Śiva and Mahāviṣṇu in redeeming that great initial votary of Śiva, see the elaborate notes under IV-10-8.




## 7.5.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

செல்ல உணர்ந்தவர் செல்வன்தன் சீர்அன்றி கற்பரோ,  
எல்லை இலாத பெரும்தவத்தால் பல செய்மிறை,  
அல்லல் அமரரைச் செய்யும் இரணியன் ஆகத்தை,  
மல்லல் அரிஉருஆய் செய்த மாயம் அறிந்துமே?

cella uṇarntavar celvaṉtaṉ cīraṉṟi kaṟparō,  
ellai ilāta perumtavattāl pala ceymiṟai,  
allal amararaic ceyyum iraṇiyaṉ ākattai,  
mallal ariuruāy ceyta māyam aṟintumē?

**English translation of verse 7.5.8:**

Will those with knowledge, full and perfect,  
Learn aught but the glory great of the Lord affluent,  
Knowing how, as the gigantic Ari, He tore apart  
The body of Iraṇiyaṉ, the demon who thro’ penance immense  
Acquired enormous strength and did the Devas tease and torment?

**Notes:**

\(i\) The knowledgeable persons, whose thoughts can reach the farthest lengths, will not stop short of revelling in the Supreme Lord’s glory, His auspicious traits and wondrous deeds.

\(ii\) Hiraṇya (Iraṇiyaṉ) was very formidable indeed, armed with many a boon acquired by Him, by dint of the severest penance imaginable. But he paled into insignificance before the mighty Ari (Narasiṃha) of enormous size like unto the water collected in the hoof-mark of the cow (the shallow depression on the ground caused by the hoof of the animal) vis-a-vis the oceanic waters. Could one’s mind be turned away from a Lord shedding such astounding grace on His devotees?




## 7.5.9
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மாயம் அறிபவர் மாயவற்கு ஆள்அன்றி ஆவரோ,  
தாயம் செறும் ஒரு நூற்றுவர் மங்க ஓர்ஐவர்க்குஆய்,  
தேசம் அறிய ஓர் சாரதியாய்ச் சென்று சேனையை  
நாசம் செய்திட்டு, நடந்த நல் வார்த்தை அறிந்துமே?

tēcam aṟiya ōr cāratiyāyc ceṉṟu cēṉaiyai  
nācam ceytiṭṭu, naṭanta nal vārttai aṟintumē?

**English translation of verse 7.5.9:**

Will those well-versed with the wondrous Lord’s exploits magnificent  
Ever subserve any but Him, so loving and munificent,  
Knowing how He became world-famous as the peerless charioteer,  
For the sake of the illustrious five to whom He did cater,  
Annihilating their hundred coparceners unfriendly and did the armies shatter  
And the heartening word that He went to the Celestium thereafter?

**Notes:**

Oh, what an amazing simplicity! the Supreme Lord of the entire Universe did the mean job of driving Arjuna’s chariot and that too, in public, on the battle field. When, at his sweet will, a superior person condescends to serve a subordinate, it is usually done *in camera*, and not in public. But here is the Divine charioteer, who not only kept Himself open to public gaze in His Incarnate Form as Kṛṣṇa, but even to day stands before us, in His Iconic (worshippable)

Form as ‘Pārtha Sārathi’ (Arjuna’s charioteer) at Triplicane (Tiru-allikkēṇi) in Madras, and as Pāṇḍava Dhūta in Tamilnadu (near Madras) and also in Kāñcī (also in Tamil nadu).




## 7.5.10
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வார்த்தை அறிபவர் மாயவற்கு ஆள்அன்றி ஆவரோ,  
போர்த்த பிறப்பொடு நோயொடு மூப்பொடு இறப்புஇவை

**English translation of verse 7.5.10:**

Will those that appreciate the wholesome message  
Of the Lord’s ‘Song Celestial’ and with clarity of mind ponder  
What unto them the Lord has done, the long list of favours,  
Ridding them of the blinding cloak of birth, pestilence, old age  
And death, cutting out, (root and branch), the great disaster,  
(Of getting lost in self-enjoyment) and granting asylum secure  
At His very feet, serve aught but the wondrous Sire?

**Notes:**

\(i\) The quintessence of the Lord’s message in Bhagavad Gītā is in the ‘Carama Śloka’ (XVIII-66), that which treats of the final or the ultimate ‘Means’, the loving path of surrender unto God, taking Him as the Sole Refuge, the ‘Means’ and the ‘End’ combined. This song is virtually a commentary of that Ślokā, vide also the closing aphorism (289) of ‘Mumukṣuppaṭi’ (Lokācārya’s Manual for the seekers of Mokṣa).

\(ii\) Birth, in the midst of the worldlings with the attendant risk of becoming oblivious of one’s essential nature caught up in a mesh like the spider’s web, sickness which saps one’s energies, the sudden onslaught of old age, like a thunderbolt and the dark hand of death falling on one’s shoulders unawares, are disastrous enough. The greatest disaster of all would, however, be emancipation from the above calamities and staying in a disembodied state, lost in self-enjoyment (known as Kaivalya mokṣa) without tasting the bliss of divine service. It is indeed the greatest of all the favours showered on us by the Lord to wean us away *in toto* from courting this eternal disaster of ‘Kaivalya anubhava’ and vouchsafe unto us the blissful service at His lotus feet, in that Eternal Land (Heaven), with absolutely no risk of our slipping back to the old ways, indeed the greatest of all His benefactions before which all the rest shall pale into insignificance.




## 7.5.11
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

தெளிவுற்று வீவுஇன்றி நின்றவர்க்கு இன்பக்கதிசெய்யும்,  
தெளிவுற்ற கண்ணனைத் தென்குருகூர்ச் சடகோபன்சொல்,  
தெளிவுற்ற ஆயிரத்துள் இவை பத்தும் வல்லார், அவர்

**English translation of verse 7.5.11:**

Those that learn these songs ten  
Out of the lucid thousand composed by Caṭakōpaṉ,  
Of kurukūr, adoring the Lord, who clarity personified is,  
And bestows on His devotees, clear and steadfast, final bliss.  
Will clarity of mind attain even in this land of dismal distress.

**Notes:**

\(i\) *The lucid thousand*: Like unto the turbid water in the river becoming clear and limpid in certain areas, the vedas, confused like the gummy substance in the jack fruit sticking to the straw-like stuff covering the fruit, acquire clarity in the hands of Saint Nammāḻvār.

\(ii\) *The devotees, clear and steadfast*: Devotees with a clear conviction, like that of the Āḻvār, that the Lord is their Sole Refuge, which cannot be shaken. The clarity of knowledge is like that obtained by Arjuna who confessed to his doubts having been dispelled on hearing Lord Kṛṣṇa’s teachings. In this context, it is interesting to recall the following conversation between Nañcīyar and his illustrious disciple, Nampiḷḷai:

*Nampiḷḷai*: “Sire, did Arjuna attain the Lord or not?”

*Nañcīyar*: “It is immaterial whether Arjuna attained God or not and your question is hardly relevant. We have to pin our faith to Gītā as the Lord’s teachings without enquiring who are all the beneficiaries, even as the thirsty quench their thirst by drinking nice, cool water at sight, without caring to ascertain the names of those whose thirst has already been quenched by drinking water”.
