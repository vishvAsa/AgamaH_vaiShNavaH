## 00 Intro3.5
In the last decad, we saw the Āḻvār enjoying the Lord’s immanence in quite a marvellous way. So ecstatic and love-smitten did he become on beholding the Lord’s ‘Vibhūti’, vast and varied, immense and interesting, defying description, that he was thrown into the rapturous state of singing and dancing. One has only to witness a Saint in his moments of rapturous ravishment in union with God, moments when his whole being thrills with love and his eyes swim with the pearls of tears of delight. This also reflects the behaviour of the exalted denizens of the high heavens, who drink deep incessantly from that inexhaustible fountain of bliss, the Lord. No wonder then, Sage Nārada and other celestial bards always dance as they sing, and sing as they dance, in the immediate presence of the Lord, completely swayed by God-love of extraordinary intensity. As a matter of fact, the hands and feet as well as the other limbs, graciously dowered on us by the Lord, can prove their worth only in this way. Naturally, the Āḻvār felt disappointed, rather distressed when he found that, barring a handful, the bulk of the worldlings around was very far from such intoxicating God-love. While he is all praises for the few kindred souls, he is unsparing in his condemnation of the otherwise. This provides the theme of this decad.

In the second decad of this centum, the Āḻvār was in dire distress but the gloom was dispelled by the joy of contemplation of unremitting service unto the Lord at Tiruvēṅkaṭam, the meeting ground of the Celestials and the Earthly men. (3-3). In the fourth decad, the Āḻvār’s joy knew no bounds, as we have just seen. To the superficial observer, such alternating moods of the Āḻvār may seem objectionable in as much as they appear to come into conflict with the general principles laid down for the pursuit of the discipline, known as ‘Bhakti’. Of the seven steps leading to ‘Bhakti’, the first is ‘Viveka’ and the last two are ‘anavasāda [*anavasādaḥ*]’ (non-depression) and ‘anuddharsa [*anuddharsaḥ*]’ (non-elation). The practicians of ‘Bhakti’ are prohibited from getting unduly depressed or unduly elated. These prohibitions, however, apply only to material things of the mundane world under the impact of physical pain and pleasure, commonly experienced by the Souls in bondage. These injunctions cannot contain the ultra-mundane happiness of the Saints and other Godly men resulting from their constant communion with the Lord and joyful contemplation of His wondrous trails and deeds or their grief arising from the aloofness of the worldlings from God-thirst and God-hunger.




## 3.5.1
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மொய்ம்மாம் பூம்பொழில் பொய்கை முதலைச் சிறைப்பட்டு நின்ற,  
கைம்மாவுக்கு அருள் செய்த கார்முகில் போல்வண்ணன் கண்ணன்,  
எம்மானைச் சொல்லிப் பாடி எழுந்தும் பறந்தும் துள்ளாதார்,  
தம்மாம் கருமம் என் சொல்லீர் தண்கடல் வட்டத்து உள்ளீரே! (2)

moymmām pūmpoḻil poykai mutalaic ciṟaippaṭṭu niṉṟa,  
kaimmāvukku aruḷ ceyta kārmukil pōlvaṇṇaṉ kaṇṇaṉ,  
emmāṉaic collip pāṭi eḻuntum paṟantum tuḷḷātār,  
tammām karumam eṉ collīr taṇkaṭal vaṭṭattu uḷḷīrē! (2)

**English translation of verse 3.5.1:**

Ye, men of Earth, bound by the cool oceanic waters!  
Tell me what use there can be of those creatures  
Who sing not the glory of Kaṇṇaṉ, our cloud-hued Lord,  
Who rescued (Gajendra) the elephant that stood ensnared  
By a crocodile in the pond amid orchards dense  
And leap about and dance in gay abandon, with devotion intense.

**Notes**

\(i\) Unto him, who remains unmoved by the good turn done by the Lord to Gajendra, the pious elephant in dire distress, his very birth is a terrible waste.

\(ii\) *The pond amid dense orchards*: In the forest inhabited by Gajendra, the pious elephant, who made history in the world of devotion, all the lotus tanks had gone dry, due to scarcity of rains. This put a grievous stop to the daily offering of lotus flowers by the elephant to the Deity and as such, empty days rolled on, the elephant grew restless and went hither and thither, in search of lotus flowers. Scenting his way through, at long last, he came up to a hill-top where he sighted a lovely pond, studded with lotus flowers, surrounded by a nice cluster of gardens. In his eagerness to pluck the flowers and resume the diurnal worship, long discontinued, the elephant just lost sight of a crocodile lying across and got trapped by the fell adversary. On hearing the alarum raised by the elephant after a titanic struggle with its grim opponent, the Lord rushed to the pond, post-haste, rescued the elephant from the spacious jaws of the crocodile and caressed the wounds on its leg.

\(iii\) While discoursing on this Song, Śrī Parāśara Bhaṭṭar is said to have painfully observed, as follows:

We are here, at this end, to remain unmoved by the multifarious good done to us by the Lord and He is there, at the other end, to get concerned about every little mishap that befalls us. This sets out in sharp contrast, our callous indifference to Him and His tender solicitude for us.




## 3.5.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

தண்கடல் வட்டத்து உள்ளாரைத் தமக்கு இரையாத் தடிந்து உண்ணும்,  
திண்கழல்கால் அசுரர்க்குத் தீங்கு இழைக்கும் திருமாலைப்,  
பண்கள் தலைக்கொள்ளப் பாடி பறந்தும் குனித்தும் உழலாதார்,  
மண்கொள் உலகில் பிறப்பார் வல்வினை மோத மலைந்தே.

taṇkaṭal vaṭṭattu uḷḷārait tamakku iraiyāt taṭintu uṇṇum,  
tiṇkaḻalkāl acurarkkut tīṅku iḻaikkum tirumālaip,  
paṇkaḷ talaikkoḷḷap pāṭi paṟantum kuṉittum uḻalātār,  
maṇkoḷ ulakil piṟappār valviṉai mōta malaintē.

**English translation of verse 3.5.2:**

Those that sing not tunefully the glory  
Of Tirumāl, who does on the Asurās gory,  
That kill and eat up the denizens of this Earth,  
Bound by the oceans cool, pour all His wrath,  
Tormenting them and fail to leap about and dance in gay-abandon  
Will in this sinful world get trapped, (again and again).

**Notes**

\(i\) The Āḻvār deplores those who do not recognise the enormous good done to them by the Lord, by way of protecting them from the devilish. Failure on their part to gratefully acknowledge the Lord’s benefaction will only get them consigned to Saṃsāra, the breeding ground for sins and the resultant miseries and involvement in the dreadful cycle of birth and death.

\(ii\) By ‘Asuras’ is not meant those born in the Asura clan. As a matter of fact, the two broad classifications, indicated by Lord Kṛṣṇa in Chapter XVI-6 of Bhagavad Gītā, are ‘Devas’, the Divine and ‘Asuras’, the Devilish. Whosoever renders service to the Lord and His devotees or co-operates with those who render such service is the ‘Divine’ while those who range themselves opposite and hate God and His devotees and obstruct the service rendered to them, are the ‘Devilish’. Even Lakṣmī, who is Grace personified and knows not what it is to punish (ajñātha nigrahai [?]), is one with the Lord, in the matter of inflicting punishment on the ‘Devilish’.




## 3.5.3
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மலையை எடுத்து கல்மாரி காத்து பசுநிரை தன்னைத்,  
தொலைவு தவிர்த்த பிரானைச் சொல்லிச்சொல்லி நின்று எப்போதும்,  
தலையினோடு ஆதனம் தட்டத் தடுகுட்டமாய்ப் பறவாதார்,  
அலை கொள் நரகத்து அழுந்திக் கிடந்து உழைக்கின்ற வம்பரே.

malaiyai eṭuttu kalmāri kāttu pacunirai taṉṉait,  
tolaivu tavirtta pirāṉaic colliccolli niṉṟu eppōtum,  
talaiyiṉōṭu ātaṉam taṭṭat taṭukuṭṭamāyp paṟavātār,  
alai koḷ narakattu aḻuntik kiṭantu uḻaikkiṉṟa vamparē.

**English translation of verse 3.5.3:**

Those that do not spell, again and again,  
The glory of the Lord who held aloft the mountain  
And from the fury of stony rain saved the cattle  
And leap about for ever, upside down and in joy rattle,  
Are but duds destined to drudge in the dismal hell.

**Note**

Even remaining unresponsive to the great gesture of the Lord, His acts of grace galore and the resultant failure to laud Him and leap about with joy would be tantamount to entry into hell and these are the very persons eagerly sought after by yama’s hordes for being despatched to hell.




## 3.5.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வம்பு அவிழ் கோதைபொருட்டா மால்விடை ஏழும் அடர்த்த,  
செம்பவளத் திரள் வாயன் சிரீதரன் தொல்புகழ் பாடி,  
கும்பிடு நட்டம் இட்டு ஆடி கோகு உகட்டுண்டு உழலாதார்,  
தம்பிறப்பால் பயன் என்னே சாது சனங்களிடையே?

vampu aviḻ kōtaiporuṭṭā mālviṭai ēḻum aṭartta,

kumpiṭu naṭṭam iṭṭu āṭi kōku ukaṭṭuṇṭu uḻalātār,  
tampiṟappāl payaṉ eṉṉē cātu caṉaṅkaḷiṭaiyē?

**English translation of verse 3.5.4:**

Of what use are those born amidst the devout pure and pious,  
That sing not and jump not, running riot,  
Adoring the coral-lipped cirītaraṉ’s glory great,  
His taming of the unruly bulls seven for winning the hand  
Of the Bride (Nappiṉṉai) wearing the highly fragrant garland?

**Notes**

\(i\) The Āḻvār is vexed with those indifferent sinners, born in the midst of the ‘Sātvik Souls’ (good and pure), not losing themselves in ecstatic adoration of the glory, of Lord Kṛṣṇa who tamed, all at once, seven unruly bulls and won Nappiṉṉai, the charming bride, niece of Queen Yaśodā,

\(ii\) *Coral-lipped Cirītaraṉ*: The red lips of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, rendered all the more enchanting by His bewitching smile of victory over the unruly bulls.

\(iii\) Śrī Piḷḷaippiḷḻai, a disciple of kūrattāḻvāṉ, drew up the following contrasting picture, to illustrate the phraseology “persons born in the midst of the ‘Sātvik’ (pure and pious people), used in this song.

Near the holy tank, Candra puṣkaraṇi, within the precincts of the temple of Lord Raṅganātha in Śrīraṅgam, there is the sacred Puṉṉai tree. Under the shade of this tree, the religious Pundits used to give learned discourses to the handful of devout listeners, squeezed in the little space available in the passage around, in rapt attention. There would, of course, be no objection to a further influx of like-minded listeners, keen and receptive, adding to the congestion. But see how odd and irksome it would be, if the hefty villagers with their hairy, humpy shoulders, pot-bellies and headgears, passing along, thrust themselves in, out of sheer curiosity, and elbow the pious listeners out.




## 3.5.5
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

சாது சனத்தை நலியும் கஞ்சனைச் சாதிப்பதற்கு,  
ஆதி அம் சோதி உருவை அங்கு வைத்து இங்குப் பிறந்த,,  
வேத முதல்வனைப் பாடி வீதிகள் தோறும் துள்ளாதார்,  
ஓதி உணர்ந்தவர் முன்னா என் சவிப்பார் மனிசரே?

vēta mutalvaṉaip pāṭi vītikaḷ tōṟum tuḷḷātār,  
ōti uṇarntavar muṉṉā eṉ cavippār maṉicarē?

**English translation of verse 3.5.5:**

Not all their learning and mumblings dry will make them men,  
If they dance not in the open streets, love-smitten  
And sing not the glory of the Lord, by Vedas acclaimed  
As the foremost, who did in all that supernal splendor descend  
From the high heavens, to kill Kañcaṉ, the tyrant  
Who did the soft and pious men torment.

**[Notes](https://www.wisdomlib.org/admin/files/tiruvaymoli/abbyy_macro.php?v=book3#bookmark213)**

\(i\) In the preceding decad the Āḻvār enjoyed the Vibhūtīs collectively, being the Lord’s controlled possessions. But now he differentiates between the Lord’s subjects; he is all praises for those love-drunk and love-smitten possessing enormous God-hunger and God-thirst like himself but condemns unreservedly those who are not charged with such God-love. The Āḻvār has no hesitation in declaring the massive learning and ritualistic, prosaic exercises in mumblings and genuflections, palmed off as prayers by those in the latter category, as wholly futile.

\(ii\) The Lord’s incarnations and the herculean deeds performed by Him during those incarnations, were due to the unpardonable sins committed by Kaṃsa and other demoniac forces, by way of teasing and tormenting the pious and the pure, like Vasudeva and Devakī. Whereas the Lord is least mindful of direct affront thrown at Him, He gets furious when His devotees are offended and He will never exercise His proverbial clemency, in respect of such grievous offenders. Those who comprehend the Lord’s enormous love for His devotees cannot but throw off all their sophistication and conventional formalities and leap about and dance like mad men, in the streets, big and small, singing His great glory. It would be appropriate to mention the following anecdote, in this context.

The king built a cluster of houses for presentation to the poor. He was, however, very much averse to Vaiṣṇavites and so, he flatly declined to hand over one of the houses to Miḷakāḻvāṉ, a Vaiṣṇava, when approached by the latter for the grant. The supplicant, however, wanted to know from the king the grounds on which the grant was negatived.

The king bluntly replied:

“No doubt, you are worthy, in other respects, but as a Vaiṣṇava and a disciple of Śrī Rāmānuja, you stand disqualified.”

So great was Miḷakāḻvāṉ’s love of his religion and his great Preceptor, that he exclaimed: ‘Oh, is that so? I am mighty glad, you recognise me as a Vaiṣṇava although I thought I was not worthy of being called as one.

“So saying, he gathered up his garment, threw it up in the air and danced with joy”.




## 3.5.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மனிசரும் மற்றும் முற்றும் ஆய் மாயப் பிறவி பிறந்த,  
தனியன் பிறப்பிலி தன்னை தடங்கடல் சேர்ந்த பிரானை,  
கனியை கரும்பின் இன் சாற்றை கட்டியை தேனை அமுதை,  
முனிவு இன்றி ஏத்திக் குனிப்பார் முழுது உணர் நீர்மையினார.

maṉicarum maṟṟum muṟṟum āy māyap piṟavi piṟanta,  
taṉiyaṉ piṟappili taṉṉai taṭaṅkaṭal cērnta pirāṉai,  
kaṉiyai karumpiṉ iṉ cāṟṟai kaṭṭiyai tēṉai amutai,  
muṉivu iṉṟi ēttik kuṉippār muḻutu uṇar nīrmaiyiṉāra.

**English translation of verse 3.5.6:**

Perfect knowledge vests in those that dance  
And sing with great joy the glory of the Lord,  
The delicious fruit, candy, honey and Cane-juice,  
The nectar grand, reclining on the milk-ocean broad,  
Who, birthless though, did come down in many ways,  
Now as man, then as Deva and so on, wondrous and peerless.

**Notes**

\(i\) The Lord is birthless in the sense that He is not, by any means, involved like us, in the inevitable cycle of birth and rebirth, eking out the results of our good and bad actions. And yet, He incarnates many times and in many ways out of His own free will, assuming the form most appropriate to the particular occasion and purpose. Those who go into raptures in contemplation of these beneficent Avatāra of the highly delicious Lord, could indeed be deemed to have assimilated the quintessence of all learning.

\(ii\) *Reclining on the milk-ocean*: This refers to the ‘Vyūha’ aspect of the Lord reclining on the milky ocean, the centre of creative activity, where the Lord contem-plates the ways and means of reclaiming us all from the ocean of Saṃsāra—birth and bondage.

\(iii\) With all their massive learning, if people are not visibly moved by the Lord’s auspicious traits and do not take a deep plunge into them, they should indeed be deemed ignorant. On the other hand, those that are not conversant with any of the Śāstras but get into the region of ecstasy, entranced mentally, orally and physically, by the Lord’s auspicious traits and wondrous deeds, are virtually all-knowing.




## 3.5.7
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நீர்மை இல் நூற்றுவர் வீய ஐவர்க்கு அருள்செய்து நின்று,  
பார்மல்கு சேனை அவித்த பரஞ்சுடரை நினைந்து ஆடி  
நீர்மல்கு கண்ணினர் ஆகி நெஞ்சம் குழைந்து நையாதே,  
ஊன் மல்கி மோடு பருப்பார் உத்தமர்கட்கு என் செய்வாரே?

nīrmai il nūṟṟuvar vīya aivarkku aruḷceytu niṉṟu,  
pārmalku cēṉai avitta parañcuṭarai niṉaintu āṭi  
nīrmalku kaṇṇiṉar āki neñcam kuḻaintu naiyātē,  
ūṉ malki mōṭu paruppār uttamarkaṭku eṉ ceyvārē?

**English translation of verse 3.5.7:**

Of what use unto the devout are they  
That are fat and pot-bellied, who melt not  
In ecstasy, singing and dancing with tears of joy,  
Meditating on the resplendent Lord Supreme Who did blot  
The cruel hundred out and on (their cousins) five shed His grace  
Routing the armies and ridding Earth of unwholesome populace?

**Note**

The ‘Kauravas’ (the cruel hundred) would just not allow their five cousins, the Pāṇḍavas, to co-exist. The Lord had, therefore, to annihilate such terribly hostile cousins of the Pāṇḍavas and, in the process, He got the Earth rid of its unwholesome burden. Crores of Sādhus would, by no means, be a burden to Mother Earth to whom they are just as light as cotton, but the sinners press too heavily on her. The Āḻvār deplores the conduct of those remaining unmoved by the Lord’s enormous grace, shown to His devotees as above. These hapless men seem to have been born just to make their poor mothers suffer the pangs of labour. It is a pity such men cannot be of any use to the devout Vaiṣṇavas at whose beck and call the Lord and all His possessions ever remain. While on this subject, the following episode will be interesting and instructive:

In the court of a Cōḷa Rājā, Periya Nampi, Śrī Rāmānuja’s preceptor, had to undergo mortification owing to his refusal to subscribe to the slogan raised by the King and his men, “Śiva is the Supreme God”. Some of these men, however, wanted to claim the merit which accrues by cremating the uncared-for corpses of the destitute and rushed to the scene of death of Periya Nampi. But they shrank back, when they saw the illustrious Kūrattāḻvāṉ by the side of that great Ācārya.

Kūrattāḷvāṉ admonished them by saying,

> “You fellows can hardly find a single destitute Vaiṣṇava by cremating
> whom you seem to be in for cheap merit. You should all know that the
> Lord and all His worlds are there to subserve the Vaiṣṇavas at all
> times”.




## 3.5.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வார்புனல் அம் தண் அருவி வடதிருவேங்கடத்து எந்தை,  
பேர்பல சொல்லிப் பிதற்றி பித்தர் என்றே பிறர்கூற,  
ஊர்பல புக்கும் புகாதும் உலோகர் சிரிக்க நின்று ஆடி,  
ஆர்வம் பெருகிக் குனிப்பார் அமரர் தொழப்படுவாரே.

vārpuṉal am taṇ aruvi vaṭatiruvēṅkaṭattu entai,  
pērpala collip pitaṟṟi pittar eṉṟē piṟarkūṟa,  
ūrpala pukkum pukātum ulōkar cirikka niṉṟu āṭi,  
ārvam perukik kuṉippār amarar toḻappaṭuvārē.

**English translation of verse 3.5.8:**

Those that articulate, with yearning deep, the names many  
Of our Lord in Vaṭa Tiruvēṅkaṭam, with its fountains many  
And cool, nice cascades, pass in and out of many a town,  
Singing and dancing in ecstasy like mad men,  
By worldlings ridiculed, will be worshipped by those in heaven.

**Note**

The Āḻvār extols those who worship the Lord in His Arcā form at the various pilgrim centres, like Tiruvēṅkaṭam, despite their being steeped in ‘Saṃsāra’ in an abode notorious for its nescience. These men the Āḻvār would like to place in a category even above those exalted Souls in Heaven. Seeing that the Supreme Lord in His Arcā form wherein converge all auspicious attributes in unlimited measure, is near at hand, easily accessible, these men go into a trance and keep on singing and dancing with wild joy, moving round towns and villages, completely absorbed in devotion. While the worldlings callously look on with wonder and amusement, as they do in the case of mad men, even the Nitya Sūris, the ever-free angels in heaven, adore these devotees on Earth running riot with God-love. (The episode relating to Mīḷakāḻvāṉ, cited in the notes below III-5-5, could be recapitulated here as well.)




## 3.5.9
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அமரர் தொழப்படுவானை அனைத்து உலகுக்கும் பிரானை,  
அமர மனத்தினுள் யோகு புணர்ந்து அவன் தன்னோடு ஒன்று ஆக,  
அமரத் துணிய வல்லார்கள் ஒழிய அல்லாதவர் எல்லாம்,  
அமர நினைந்து எழுந்து ஆடி அலற்றுவதே கருமமே.

amarar toḻappaṭuvāṉai aṉaittu ulakukkum pirāṉai,  
amara maṉattiṉuḷ yōku puṇarntu avaṉ taṉṉōṭu oṉṟu āka,  
amarat tuṇiya vallārkaḷ oḻiya allātavar ellām,  
amara niṉaintu eḻuntu āṭi alaṟṟuvatē karumamē.

**English translation of verse 3.5.9:**

Leaving the perverts alone who deem themselves on a par  
With the Lord, in *Amarars*’ hearts embedded, Sovereign Master  
Of all the worlds, it behoves the rest to meditate and sing  
His glory great, moving round in ecstasy, leaping and dancing.

**Note**

It is a great pity that the ‘Kevalas’ who develop their psychic powers and feel themselves on a par with the Supreme Lord in the final state of liberation, get lost in self-enjoyment, totally oblivious of the infinitely superior bliss of Divine Service perennially enjoyed by the ‘*Amarars*’, the immortals, in the Yonder heaven. Leaving these unfortunate souls severely alone, the Āḻvār says it is the duty of all the others to deeply meditate upon the Lord’s auspicious traits, with selfless dedication, and sing His great glory all over the place, going about leaping and dancing.




## 3.5.10
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கருமமும் கரும பலனும் ஆகிய காரணன் தன்னை,  
திருமணி வண்ணனை செங்கண் மாலினை தேவபிரானை,  
ஒருமை மனத்தினுள் வைத்து உள்ளம் குழைந்து எழுந்து ஆடி,  
பெருமையும் நாணும் தவிர்ந்து பிதற்றுமின் பேதைமை தீர்ந்தே.

karumamum karuma palaṉum ākiya kāraṇaṉ taṉṉai,  
tirumaṇi vaṇṇaṉai ceṅkaṇ māliṉai tēvapirāṉai,  
orumai maṉattiṉuḷ vaittu uḷḷam kuḻaintu eḻuntu āṭi,  
perumaiyum nāṇum tavirntu pitaṟṟumiṉ pētaimai tīrntē.

**English translation of verse 3.5.10:**

Shed all your conceit, sense of shame and ignorance  
And leap about, uttering with ecstatic incoherence,  
The names of the gem-hued, red lotus-eyed Tirumāl, the Ordainer  
Of the Universe, the deeds and their fruits, Chief of Celestials,  
With a mind fixed on Him as the ‘Means’ and the ‘End’ all at once.

**Notes**

\(i\) The Lord has to be looked upon, as both the ‘Means’ and the ‘End

\(ii\) As the Internal Controller of the Individuals, He enables them to perform deeds and He confers the results, reward or punishment, as the case may be, because the deeds by themselves can’t grant rewards or inflict punishments.

\(iii\) The Saint calls upon the people to shed their ill-conceived notions, born of conceit, which preclude them from coming under the emotional sway of the Lord’s auspicious traits and the stupid sense of shame that they shall not exhibit in public their emotional upsurge and join the ranks of the illustrious devotees moving along, singing the Lord’s glory and dancing in ecstasy.




## 3.5.11
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

தீர்ந்த அடியவர் தம்மைத் திருத்திப் பணிகொள்ளவல்ல,  
ஆர்ந்த புகழ் அச்சுதனை அமரர் பிரானை எம்மானை,  
வாய்ந்த வளவயல்சூழ் தண் வளங் குருகூர்ச்சடகோபன்,  
நேர்ந்த ஓர் ஆயிரத்து இப்பத்து அருவினை நீறு செய்யுமே. (2)

tīrnta aṭiyavar tammait tiruttip paṇikoḷḷavalla,  
ārnta pukaḻ accutaṉai amarar pirāṉai emmāṉai,  
vāynta vaḷavayalcūḻ taṇ vaḷaṅ kurukūrccaṭakōpaṉ,  
nērnta ōr āyirattu ippattu aruviṉai nīṟu ceyyumē. (2)

**English translation of verse 3.5.11:**

These songs ten, out of the thousand composed  
By caṭakōpaṉ of fertile kurukūr, adoring Accutaṉ, the Lord  
Of glory great, Chief of Celestials, Protector steadfast,  
Who redeems those that unto Him stick fast,  
As sole refuge and enlists them in His service eternal,  
Will to ashes reduce all sins, however cruel.

**Note**

Failure to go into raptures, in contemplation of the Lord’s auspicious traits and wondrous deeds, sing and dance, literally dissolved in Him, would, ṇo doubt, fall under the category of ‘irredeemable’ sins. These ten songs win, however, destroy even this type of sin and keep the chanters beyond its mischief.
