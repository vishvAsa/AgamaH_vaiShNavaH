## 00 Intro7.3
The bliss of the union of the Nāyaki and Lord Raṅganātha having overflown its continents, the Lord hit upon a method whereby the enjoyment could be stabilised instead of the Nāyaki being swept off by its exuberance. He went to Tentiruppēreyil, near the Āḻvār’s birth-place, game-hunting by way of relieving the distress of the people over there from the depredations of wild animals. The Nāyaki herself equipped Him with weapons, went with Him straight to the outer gate and bid Him farewell, wishing Him success. The Lord, mounted on Garuḍa, threw a bewitching parting glance at her. But then, she couldn’t bear the separation and insisted that she would also go to Tentiruppēreyil to join her Lord, in the face of opposition from her mother, mates and other, kinsmen. The Nāyakī, bent upon going, suggests a via-media namely, if they are against her going alone, they could as well escort her to the place and leave her there with her Lord.




## 7.3.1
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வெள்ளைச் சுரிசங்கொடு ஆழி ஏந்தி தாமரைக் கண்ணன்என் நெஞ்சினூடே,  
புள்ளைக் கடாகின்றஆற்றைக் காணீர் என்சொல்லிச் சொல்லுகேன் அன்னைமீர்காள்,  
வெள்ளச் சுகம்அவன் வீற்றிருந்த வேத ஒலியும் விழா ஒலியும்,  
பிள்ளைக் குழா விளையாட்டுஒலியும் அறா திருப்பேரெயில் சேர்வன் நானே! (2)

piḷḷaik kuḻā viḷaiyāṭṭuoliyum aṟā tiruppēreyil cērvaṉ nāṉē! (2)

**English translation of verse 7.3.1:**

Ye, elders, for Tiruppēreyil I am indeed bound,  
Where Vedic chantings, festivals and joyous shouts of children resound  
With no break and the Lord, the very spate of bliss, stays;  
How can I express the glorious vision that sways  
My mind, the way the lotus- eyed Lord mounts the bird (Garuḍa)  
Holding the spiral conch white and the discus in hand,  
Which is what You people can’t comprehend?

**Notes:**

\(i\) The Nāyakī says, she can’t describe her glorious mental vision adequately. What she has said in this song, touches but a fringe of the subject.

\(ii\) The undying noise of the children at play, is the unique feature of this pilgrim centre where the children play right in front of the temple. Eager to witness the children at play, the Deity would appear to have asked Garuḍa, installed light in front, to step aside without obstructing His view. Further, the festivals, with their usual fanfare, go on in this centre in an unbroken succession; it is said that Akrūra, the great devotee of Lord Kṛṣṇā, celebrated festivals in quick succession, after he came by the fabulous “Syamantakamaṇi”, a rare gem capable of generating fabulous wealth and here is Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī, the gem of a woman and there can be no dearth of festivals, wherever she goes.




## 7.3.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நானக் கருங்குழல் தோழிமீர்காள்! அன்னையர்காள்! அயல் சேரியீர்காள்,  
நான்இத் தனிநெஞ்சம் காக்க மாட்டேன் என்வசம் அன்றுஇதுஇராப்பகல்போய்,  
தேன்மொய்த்த பூம்பொழில் தண்பணைசூழ் தென்திருப் பேரெயில் வீற்றி ருந்த,  
வானப்பிரான் மணிவண்ணன் கண்ணன் செங்கனி வாயின் திறத்ததுவே.

nāṉak karuṅkuḻal tōḻimīrkāḷ! aṉṉaiyarkāḷ! ayal cēriyīrkāḷ,  
nāṉit taṉineñcam kākka māṭṭēṉ eṉvacam aṉṟuituirāppakalpōy,  
tēṉmoytta pūmpoḻil taṇpaṇaicūḻ teṉtirup pēreyil vīṟṟi runta,  
vāṉappirāṉ maṇivaṇṇaṉ kaṇṇaṉ ceṅkaṉi vāyiṉ tiṟattatuvē.

**English translation of verse 7.3.2:**

Ye, mates with dark hair aromatic, ye, elders and neighbours,  
Gone out of hand, My mind, I can’t control; day and night,  
Ahead of me it goes and lurks in the lips, like unto red fruit,  
Of Kaṇṇaṉ, the heavenly Lord of sapphire hue, Who stays  
In Teṉtiruppēreyil with lands fertile and flower gardens full of honey bees.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The apparent incongruity of the mates appearing before the disconsolate Nāyakī with their hair nicely tended and perfumed, is reconciled by Nampiḷḷai, as follows:—

When the Nāyakī was in communion with the Lord, the flowers worn and discarded by Him would be picked up by the mates and worn by them even if they be mere shreds. The perfume therefrom is everlasting and it serves to sustain the Nāyakī, when the Lord is not beside her, as at present.

Alternately, it could be that the mates, bent upon rallying the Nāyakī round, should not themselves present a picture of dejection, with dishevelled hair. This is like Lakṣmaṇa having kept himself fit for serving Rāma, although the former’s grief was by-no-means less than that of the latter over the abduction of Sītā.

\(ii\) The worldlings cannot be weaned away from sensual pleasures even as the Nāyakī cannot be weaned away from God-head. The God-bent mind of the Nāyakī has taken a leap ahead of her and got absorbed in Him completely. There is, therefore, no question of her being brought round by any one, not even the concerted action of the mates, mother and neighbours. Instead of the mind being subordinate to her, it is now the other way round. In short, the Nāyakī, enthralled by the Lord at Tiruppēreyil, is beyond recovery, from the point of view of the worldlings to whom she is lost altogether.




## 7.3.3
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

செங்கனி வாயின் திறத்ததாயும் செஞ்சுடர் நீள்முடி தாழ்ந்ததாயும்,  
சங்கொடு சக்கரம் கண்டுஉகந்தும் தாமரைக் கண்களுக்கு அற்றுத் தீர்ந்தும்,  
திங்களும் நாளும் விழாஅறாத தென்திருப்பேரெயில் வீற்றிருந்த,  
நங்கள்பிரானுக்குஎன் நெஞ்சம் தோழீ! நாணும் நிறையும் இழந்ததுவே.

ceṅkaṉi vāyiṉ tiṟattatāyum ceñcuṭar nīḷmuṭi tāḻntatāyum,  
caṅkoṭu cakkaram kaṇṭuukantum tāmaraik kaṇkaḷukku aṟṟut tīrntum,  
tiṅkaḷum nāḷum viḻāaṟāta teṉtiruppēreyil vīṟṟirunta,  
naṅkaḷpirāṉukkueṉ neñcam tōḻī! nāṇum niṟaiyum iḻantatuvē.

**English translation of verse 7.3.3:**

Come, ye, mate, enthralled by the Lord’s fruit-like lips red,  
Enamoured of His tall resplendent crown, glowing red,  
Enticed by His conch and discus and by His lotus eyes enslaved  
My mind has unto the Lord, in Teṉtiruppēreyil enshrined,  
With its fanfare of festivals unbroken, lost its reserve and refinement.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The elders and neighbours having retreated from the scene, giving up the task of reclaiming the Nāyakī as hopeless, only the mate stays on, for further counselling. When she points out how unbecoming of the feminine rank and position the conduct of the Nāyakī is, the latter indicates in this song what indeed brought her to this pass. Actually, the Nāyakī’s mind is getting exclusively absorbed in each one of these features of the Lord, even as He pervades all things, *in toto*, inside out. It is worth recalling, in this context the anecdote of Śaubhari. Great indeed was the spiritual prowess of sage Śoubhari. One day he went to a pond and noticed the fish playing about, huddled together. This fascinated the mind of the sage, steeped in renunciation till then, to lead a married life and rear up a large family, as in the fish pond. Learning that king Māndhāthā had fifty charming princesses, all unmarried, the sage asked the king to give him one of his daughters in marriage. The King evaded the issue by asking the sage to propose to the Princesses directly so that whosoever liked him could be taken as his bride. The sage knew the trick of the King quite well and, therefore, transformed himself into a charming young man whom the Princesses vied with one another to marry. The powerful sage took on fifty forms, on account of his great tapasya, and married all of them. Similar is the intensity of the Āḻvār’s longing to enjoy the Lord, in minute details, assuming different forms.

\(ii\) The Lord is enshrined in His Iconic (Worshippable) Form for the sake of us, the bound souls lingering in this world, even as His transcendent Form in Heaven is for the enjoyment of the ‘Nityas’ (Eternal heroes) and ‘Muktas’ (Released Souls) there, the ‘Vyūha’ (Operative Form) in the Milky ocean is for those akin to ‘Muktas’ and the Incarnate Forms are for the fortunate ones, who existed in those good olden times. This being the case, how could the Nāyakī keep away from the Lord in His ‘Arca’ (iconic) form at Tiruppēreyil?




## 7.3.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

இழந்த எம்மாமைத் திறத்துப் போன என்நெஞ்சினாரும் அங்கே ஒழிந்தார்,  
உழந்து இனியாரைக் கொண்டுஎன்உசாகோ? ஓதக் கடல்ஒலி போல எங்கும்  
எழுந்தநல் வேதத்துஒலி நின்றுஓங்கு தென்திருப்பேரெயில் வீற்றிருந்த,

eḻuntanal vētattuoli niṉṟuōṅku teṉtiruppēreyil vīṟṟirunta,  
muḻaṅku caṅkakkaiyaṉ māyattuāḻntēṉ aṉṉaiyarkāḷ eṉṉai eṉmuṉintē?

**English translation of verse 7.3.4:**

Ye, elders, that doyen, my mind, sallied forth to get me back  
The lustre lost but there itself got badly stuck;  
My mind, thus lost, who shall hence my companion be  
And what shall I speak? can you indeed be angry with me,  
Seeing me immersed in the wondrous Lord Who wields  
The resounding conch and stays in Teṉtiruppēreyil, the standing seat  
Of Nalvētam, reverberating all over like the roaring sea?

**Notes:**

\(i\) The mind is accorded an exalted position by the Nāyakī and referred to, with great respect, by reasons of its being God-bent and competitive in its exuberance for God-enjoyment. Discoloration set in because of the Nāyakī’s extreme dejection, in her state of separation from the Lord. In a bold bid to restore to the Nāyakī her lost lustre, the mind went up to the Lord but alas! It got stuck up at that end, completely absorbed in Him. The Nāyakī can hardly find any company other than her own mind for giving her the much-needed solace and, she feels worse off than Sītā in captivity, where she had atleast Trijaḍā and Saramai to console her. The Nāyakī is worse off than Sītā, in the sense that the former cannot court the company of anyone, neither the sense-buried Earthlings nor the egotistic tin-gods of the upper worlds, nor the Nityas, totally absorbed in God-enjoyment in the yonder heaven and least of all, the One who keeps aloof, having robbed her of her very garment.

\(ii\) She herself is now caught up in the compelling charm of the Lord at Teṉtiruppēreyil and she keeps musing over the Lord’s fascinating features, all the time.

\(iii\) This pilgrim centre is said to be resonant with the sweet, chanting of Nalvētam (Sāmaveda)




## 7.3.5
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

முனிந்து சகடம் உதைத்து மாயப் பேய்முலைஉண்டு மருதுஇடைபோய்,

kaṉinta poḻil tiruppēreyiṟkē kālam peṟaeṉṉaik kāṭṭumiṉē

**English translation of verse 7.3.5:**

Ye, elders, what would you gain by rebuking me? lost is my feminity  
Unto Kaṇṇaṉ, who the demon in the cart-wheel kicked in fury.  
Sucked unto death the devil’s breast and crawled ‘twixt the twin trees,  
Smote a calf against the wood-apple right on the tree  
And slew both the demons; take me, with no more delay,  
To Tiruppēreyil, full of gardens nice where my Lord stays.

**Note**

The Nāyakī is lost unto Kaṇṇaṉ (Lord Kṛṣṇa), in the sense that the bonds of feminine reserve and refinement have burst in the face of her overwhelming, rather overpowering Godlove. She advises the elders not to attempt the senseless task of putting up the bund after all the water has escaped down the sluices but to take her to Tiruppēreyil and leave her there where the Lord has come, in advance, to reclaim her. This they should do quickly when she is still alive, seeing her precarious condition.




## 7.3.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

காலம் பெறஎன்னைக் காட்டுமின்கள் காதல் கடலின் மிகப் பெரிதால்,  
நீல முகில்வண்ணத்து எம்பெருமான் நிற்கும்முன்னே வந்துஎன் கைக்கும் எய்தான்,  
ஞாலத்துஅவன் வந்து வீற்றிருந்த நான்மறையாளரும் வேள்வி ஓவா,  
கோலச் செந்நெற்கள் கவரி வீசும் கூடுபுனல் திருப்பேரெயிற்கே.

ñālattuavaṉ vantu vīṟṟirunta nāṉmaṟaiyāḷarum vēḷvi ōvā,  
kōlac cenneṟkaḷ kavari vīcum kūṭupuṉal tiruppēreyiṟkē.

**English translation of verse 7.3.6:**

Ye, elders, it seems the cloud-hued Lord is in front of me  
And yet beyond my reach; alas! my love is bigger than the sea,  
Better take me quick to Tiruppēreyil, the place on Earth  
Where the Lord has come to stay, full of mirth,  
With water in plenty and paddy crops lovely, the centre great  
Where vedic scholars zealously perform sacred rites.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The elders point out that the Lord had just left on a hunting expedition with her consent and that the Nāyakī should not be so very impatient and that too, so soon. But then the Nāyakī’s consuming passion is such that she can’t brook separation from her Lord even for a short while. Her love is even more expansive than the ocean. That it is fast gathering momentum can be seen from the fact that her God-love, as set out in V-3-4, was of the size of the ocean and now it has grown bigger than the ocean. A little later, that is, in the eighth song of this decad itself, we find it surpassing the Earth, the seven peripheral oceans and the ultramundane regions, far beyond as well. In X-10-10, it swells up to such astounding dimensions as to encompass the Supreme Lord Himself, the very object of love.

\(ii\) How could the Nāyakī contain the on-rush of God-love with such rapid strides, and keep it under restraint, as advised by the elders, the more so, when the glorious vision of the blue-hued Lord is right in front, and yet baffles external perception and sensibility? The only way this love could be nurtured is to take her to Tiruppēreyil, where the Lord is in His worshippable form, in all His heavenly splendour, surrounded by profound Vedic scholars, fertile fields and lovely gardens. Even as the paddy crops are sustained by the standing columns of water, the entire landscape of that holy centre sustains the Nāyakī.




## 7.3.7
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

பேர்எயில் சூழ்கடல் தென்இலங்கை செற்றபிரான் வந்து வீற்றிருந்த,  
பேரெயிற்கே புக்குஎன்நெஞ்சம் நாடி பேர்த்து வரஎங்கும் காண மாட்டேன்,  
ஆரை இனிஇங்குஉடையம் தோழீ! என்நெஞ்சம் கூவ வல்லாரும் இல்லை,

ārai iṉikkoṇṭu eṉ cātikkiṉṟatu? eṉneñcam kaṇṭatuvē kaṇṭēṉē

**English translation of verse 7.3.7:**

My mind that went in quest of the Lord, who burnt down  
Laṅkā, across the sea, surrounded by walls gigantic,  
And now stays in Tiruppēreyil, hasn’t come back;  
Nobody else can keep me company nor is there any one  
To restore my mind unto me; here’s none who can perchance  
Do unto me a good turn and my mind I shall follow hence.

**Notes:**

\(i\) “Having seen in Tiruppēreyil, the victorious Lord who vanquished that felon, Rāvaṇa”, says the Nāyakī unto the mate, “it is no wonder, my mind doesn’t come back to me. Having lost such a great companion, there is hardly any point in my staying behind, as there is none who can take his place. Even you are in a state of extreme debility. It is, therefore, but meet that I follow suit and join my mind right where it has gone”. Did not Śrī Rāma say, in Uttara Rāmāyaṇa, when he set out for the Celestium after His long stay in this abode, that He was going the way Lakṣmaṇa had gone a little earlier? Lakṣmaṇa was the first to go and Śrī Rāma went a little later.

Śrī Nampiḷḷai would say that Hanumān visited even the inpenetrable Laṅkā, remote and inaccessible, from where none could return safely and came back with a message from Sītā but the Nāyakī’s mind could not get back from near-by Tiruppēreyil. And now, instead of sending a message to God, she has to send one to her mind. There is none to carry the message either. There is thus no remedy except her going there herself.

\(ii\) The Lord in Tiruppēreyil is said to be fresh from His victory over Rāvaṇa. But then, that was the time when Śrī Rāma’s mind was vitiated by feelings of suspicion and anger, leading to His acrimonious address to Sītā, in such harsh terms as:

> “My love is fled, for on thy fame  
> Lies the dark blot of sin and shame;  
> And thou art hateful as the light  
> That flashes in the injured sight”.

Śrī Āḷavandār (Saint Yāmunācārya), the great preceptor, was greatly piqued by this unreasonable accusation of the Mother and he said: “Surely, it isn’t my radiant Mother’s light that hurts but Rāma’s sore eye that is hurt. The mote is indeed in Rāma’s eye; Sītā is absolutely pure, bright like the pure flame that appears tainted owing to dark suspicion obscuring Rāma’s heart”.




## 7.3.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கண்டதுவே கொண்டுஎல்லாரும் கூடி கார்க்கடல் வண்ணனோடு என்திறத்துக்  
கொண்டு, அலர் தூற்றிற்றுஅது முதலாக் கொண்டஎன் காதல் உரைக்கில் தோழீ,  
மண்திணி ஞாலமும் ஏழ்கடலும் நீள்விசும்பும் கழியப் பெரிதால்,  
தெண்திரை சூழ்ந்துஅவன் வீற்றிருந்த தென்திருப்பேரெயில் சேர்வன் சென்றே

teṇtirai cūḻntuavaṉ vīṟṟirunta teṉtiruppēreyil cērvaṉ ceṉṟē

**English translation of verse 7.3.8:**

My mate, ever since the elders began to complain,  
Seeing the outer change in me, about my union  
With the Lord of oceanic hue, my love unto Him has swollen  
Beyond the Earth, its peripheral oceans seven  
And the ultra mundane regions afar; so then,  
My Lord at Tiruppēreyil I have to go and join.

**Note**

The people around could hardly know the depth of the Godlove swelling up the Nāyakī’s bosom but they could, in a way, notice it from the words she uttered, her lamentation and other external changes in her complexion, behaviour etc. Then, they started rebuking her but their remonstration produced the opposite effect, virtually serving as the rich manure for the speedy cultivation of her God-love. And now, it has grown to the astounding dimensions, set out in this song (See also the notes under V-3-4), VII-3-6 and X-10-10).




## 7.3.9
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

சேர்வன்சென்று என்னுடைத்தோழிமீர்காள்! அன்னையர்காள்! என்னைத்தேற்ற வேண்டா,  
நீர்கள் உரைக்கின்றது என்இதற்கு? நெஞ்சும் நிறைவும் எனக்குஇங்குஇல்லை,  
கார்வண்ணன் கார்க்கடல் ஞாலம் உண்ட கண்ண பிரான்வந்து வீற்றிருந்த,

ērvaḷa oṇkaḻaṉip paḻaṉa teṉtiruppēreyil mānakarē.

**English translation of verse 7.3.9:**

Ye, mates and elders, make no attempt to reclaim me,  
There’s hardly anything you can say, gone is my mind  
And my modesty too, and now for Tiruppēreyil am I bound,  
With its fields fertile, fed with water in plenty,  
Where resides Kaṇṇaṉ, my Lord of blue tint,  
Who the Sea-bound worlds did gulp.

**Note**

The Nāyakī insists upon going to Tiruppēreyil, as the mates and elders counselled her patience and infused in her hopes of an early return of her Beloved Lord. The Nāyakī is, however, in no mood to listen to such hollow inducements. As a matter of fact, stripped of her mind, which has preceded her in its flight to the Lord, she can hardly be receptive to all that they say. At any rate, she did not have that type of mind, that would respond to their advice. Further, she stands enthralled by the exquisite charm of the blue-hued Lord, the great Redeemer.




## 7.3.10
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நகரமும் நாடும் பிறவும் தேர்வேன் நாண்எனக்கு இல்லைஎன் தோழி மீர்காள்,  
சிகர மணிநெடு மாடம் நீடு தென்திருப் பேரெயில் வீற்றிருந்த,

**English translation of verse 7.3.10:**

My mates, I am not in the least shy to go forward  
To cities and villages in quest of those that look down  
Upon my love unto Makaraneṭuṅkuḻaikkātaṉ, the peerless Lord, cloud-hued,  
With discus in hand, of wondrous deeds, who got slain  
The hundred Kaurav brothers and now resides in Tiruppēreyil,  
The ancient city with its turrets tall and stately castles,  
Who since ages long did my heart steal.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The mates pointed out that the Nāyakī would, by darting forth in the manner repeatedly proposed by her, only invite public ridicule and criticism of her conduct. The Nāyakī, however, retorts that she would go forward in search of these very persons, in hall and hamlet, as it would indeed gladden her heart to be told about her union with Lord, Makarabhūṣaṇa (whose ears are bedecked with pearls), especially in her present state of separation from Him.

\(ii\) Even as the Lord manoeuvred, by stages, to get the hundred Kaurava brothers slain, He seems to have planned long, long back to steal away the Nāyakī’s heart.




## 7.3.11
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஊழிதோறுஊழி உருவும் பேரும் செய்கையும் வேறவன் வையம் காக்கும்,

**English translation of verse 7.3.11:**

Those that adore the Lord, with conch and discus fine,  
By chanting this decad which unto the Deity at Tiruppēreyil pertains,  
Out of the thousand peerless songs composed by Caṭakōpaṉ,  
Of lovely Kurukūr, extolling Accutan, the sea-hued Lord, Who takes on  
Different names and forms in different ages, to carry on  
His steadfast work of universal protection,  
Will in His eternal service be blessed to remain.

**Note**

The end-stanza brings out that those well-versed in these ten songs, will be blessed with the great good fortune of rendering eternal service unto the Lord, like unto His discus, ever alert and dutiful.
