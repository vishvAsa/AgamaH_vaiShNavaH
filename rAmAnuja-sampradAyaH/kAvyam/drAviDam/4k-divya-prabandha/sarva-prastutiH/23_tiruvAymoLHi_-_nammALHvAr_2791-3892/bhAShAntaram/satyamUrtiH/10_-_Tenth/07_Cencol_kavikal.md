## 00 Intro10.7
We saw the Āḻvār bursting with joy in the last decad. The Lord, Who stuck fast to the Āḻvār’s heart, would now want to get hold of the Āḻvār’s entire physical frame, limb by limb, like unto the flies swarming, in and around the jack-fruit. Well, what is the Lord’s fascination for this elemental body, which the gnostics (Jñānis) have no hesitation in condemning as foul and are ready to give up, any moment? The sweet aroma of spiritual awakening, emanating from the Jñāni’s body is indeed very pleasing to the Lord, Who, therefore, covets him and adores him, in that mortal frame, with all its dirt and stench, like unto the erotic lover doting on the body of his beloved, unmindful of its drawbacks. Do not the ladies wear, on their locks, the fragrant root, dug out of the earth, without shaking off the earthen particles of dust, lest it should diminish the fragrance?

In the case of the Āḻvār, the Lord bore unlimited love for him and He was even thinking in terms of lifting him up to heaven, with this very body. The Āḻvār, who got scent of this extraordinary thinking on the part of the Lord, even apprehended that the prolongation of his stay in this abode, in his material body, might be due to the misplaced affection of the Lord for his physical frame. The Āḻvār, therefore, realised the imperative need of his disabusing the Lord of his notions, in this regard. As a matter of fact, the Āḻvār is now free to dictate terms to the Lord in accordance with the latter’s ardent desire to serve the former. The Āḻvār could, therefore, advise the Lord to do certain things and desist from doing certain other things. In the latter category would fall the Lord’s contemplated move to lift the Āḻvār bodily to Heaven. Cornered thus, the Lord abandoned His over-ambitious project, submitting to the Āḻvār’s will. That the Sovereign Lord should desist from putting through His cherished desires, purely in deference to the Āḻvār’s mandatory injunction, excites the Āḻvār’s admiration of the Lord’s amazing simplicity and tender solicitude, ail the more. Literally lost in contemplation of these extraordinary traits of the Lord, the Āḻvār could regain his normal composure only after quite some length of time. Therefore it is, he puts others on their guard in this decad, lest they should also fare likewise, meditating on the Lord’s amazing simplicity and loving condescension. This is just like men who have struggled through deep waters and got ashore, cautioning others wading through the waters against the treacherous pit-falls which they would do well to avoid, thus placing before others the benefit of their own experience. Actually, the Āḻvār is warning likeminded poets, steeped in the selfless enjoyment of the Lord’s auspicious traits, not to get involved in these enthralling traits of the Lord but just skip over them, lest they should also be ensnared and get bogged down, as he did.

The Lord, who exhibited such a great predilection for the Āḻvār’s physical frame, is depicted, in this decad, as the One enshrined in Tirumāliruñcōlai (in Tamil Nāḍu). Omniscient though, the Lord’s love for the Jñāni is so deep and intense that He dotes on the physical frame of the Jñāni, which the latter detests, as foul and despicable. The Lord has to be weaned away from His misplaced blandishment of the Jñāni’s body by the latter’s stern advice to desist from it, seeing that it is made up of the elements and is full of dirt and stench and the Lord shall not, therefore, defile and desecrate the exalted Heaven by introducing therein his physical body, vide aphorism 185 of ‘Ācārya Hṛdayam’, characterising the Lord at Tirumāliruñcōlai as the one doting on the the Jñāni’s despicable body.




## 10.7.1
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வஞ்சக் கள்வன் மாமாயன் மாயக் கவியாய் வந்து என்-  
நெஞ்சும் உயிரும் உள்கலந்து நின்றார் அறியா வண்ணம் என்-

**English translation of verse 10.7.1:**

Beware, Ye poets, singing songs, sweet and chaste,  
Better be all attention, as you sing, else you can’t subsist;  
The Lord in mount Tirumāliruñcōlai is the mysterious One,  
Who does deceit and stealth practise; unto me He held on,  
Ostensibly to sing these songs but into my heart and soul  
Secretly He did dissolve and consumed them all;  
Thus displacing me, He did attain His stature full.

**Notes:**

\(i\) *Poets, sweet and chaste*: Poets composing songs in elegant diction, abounding in choice words, pregnant with meaning, are said to be sweet and if they also happen to be selfless singers of the Lord’s glory, they are chaste indeed. This combined appellation would, however, cover only a few poets of the eminence of the first three Āḻvārs (Poikai, Pēy and Pūtattāḻvār). the super poets, thrilling with spiritual joy and throbbing with God-love. To this exalted band of poets, the Āḻvār utters the warning, as in this song. Their very existence will be imperilled if they ever trod upon the plank of the Lord’s ‘Saulabhya’, simplicity galore, which will choke them down, in admiration, even to the point of losing themselves altogether. Evidently, the artist has to make sure of his existence, first and foremost, so that his art can flourish. When the art takes the form of service unto the Lord (Vācika Kaiṅkarya), it is but appropriate that the Āḻvār warns the artists in question against the danger lurking in the field. If they are to ensure steady and unremitting service unto the Lord, they should not go anywhere near the Lord’s enthralling traits of simplicity, easy accessibility and tender solicitude, which had rendered the Āḻvār insensate thrice, the period of suspended animation lasting as long as six months on each such occasion. The Āḻvār is thus planting the danger signal, in the vulnerable spot, for the guidance of the fellow-poets of his ilk.

Śrī Rāmānuja would have it, in this context, that the person to be saved is not the fellow-artist but the Lord Himself. When the Lord, in His unbounded love for the Jñāni’s physical frame, pounces upon him, if the  
Jñāni went on repelling His advances, surely, he may have to lose the Lord altogether. Actually, the Āḻvār reverently called the Lord’s attention to His trait of subserving the devotees (āśṛtapāratantarya) and, in the exercise thereof, He was made to desist from His ravishing love for the devotee’s body, frail and foul. Thus inhibited from the pursuit of His natural inclination, the Lord stood aloof from the Āḻvār who, however, got completely lost in rapturous meditation on the Lord’s remarkable docility in heeding his humble request. The Āḻvār, therefore, warns the fellowartists not to fare likewise and lose the Lord in the manner he did, but conform to His wishes and place no obstruction in His path and thus preserve Him.

\(ii\) When the Lord initially entered the Āḻvār’s heart, the latter was made to feel that He did so only to establish His supremacy over him. But then, He played His stealthy pranks by reversing the natural order of things and displaying the riotous love of the ardent lover. The pity of it is that the Āḻvār fell into His trap, notwithstanding the prior knowledge he had of the Lord, in this respect. Well, therein lies the Lord’s mystery to which all of us cannot but succumb. All that the Lord applied for, at the outset, was a little space in the heartregion of the Āḻvār, so as to produce from there songs of rare excellence and the Āḻvār readily responded to the Lord’s request, as he was himself wanting to sing such songs. But what happened! He who wanted just that space for the tip of His little finger to enter, got His head penetrated as well. Is this not stealth, pure and simple? What else is it but deceit, on His part?

[Oh, what a pity! there is such a miserable dearth of interest for these priceless gems of thought, imbedded in the Āḻvār’s glorious hymns, as unfolded by our great Ācāryas. There are hardly a few who would come forward to delve deep into this vast treasure of Divine Love and it is only to be hoped that, with the publication of the present glossary, their numbers would swell much beyond all expectations].




## 10.7.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

தானே ஆகி நிறைந்து எல்லாஉலகும் உயிரும் தானேஆய்  
தானே யான்என்பான்ஆகி தன்னைத் தானே துதித்து எனக்குத்-  
தேனே பாலே கன்னலே அமுதே திருமாலிருஞ்சோலைக்  
கோனே ஆகி நின்றொழிந்தான் என்னை முற்றும் உயிர்உண்டே.

tāṉē āki niṟaintu ellāulakum uyirum tāṉēāy  
tāṉē yāṉeṉpāṉāki taṉṉait tāṉē tutittu eṉakkut-  
tēṉē pālē kaṉṉalē amutē tirumāliruñcōlaik  
kōṉē āki niṉṟoḻintāṉ eṉṉai muṟṟum uyiruṇṭē.

**English translation of verse 10.7.2:**

Me the Lord did, in full, consume  
And now full has He become;  
The inner soul of worlds and beings, one and all  
Stands now transformed into me, I do fed,  
He lauds Himself thro’ me and sweet unto me  
Like candy and nectar, milk and honey,  
Lord of Tirumāliruñcōlai He has now become.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The Āḻvār finds that the Lord, Who mingled with him, completely displaced him and spread Himself out, in full, over the entire body of the Āḻvār; nay, He attained perfection and His sovereign stature only after this event. He could become God indeed only after the songs of His glory flowed from the sweet lips of the Āḻvār. It can be recalled that it is the Āḻvār who asserted the Supremacy of the Lord, vide II-2 and IV-10 of this hymnal.

\(ii\) The present predicament, in which the Āḻvār, basically the Lord’s vassal, is being subserved by Him, has been aptly described by the great Nampiḻlai in his unique diction, as follows: Dislodged from his normal stance, the Āḻvār gropes in vain to get at himself; all that he could discover, in the process is that he is being carried aloft over the Lord’s head.

\(iii\) The Lord is not merely the object of laudation but the very author of laudation, singing, as He does His own glory through the medium of the Āḻvār. If, in the endsong of each decad, it is said that it is Caṭakōpaṉ’s (Āḻvār’s) utterance, well, it is the Lord, Who made him say so.

\(iv\) The Lord is exceedingly delicious to the Āḻvār, but instead of his drinking deep of that insatiable nectar, the Lord forestalled him and drank him up, leaving no trace of him behind.




## 10.7.3
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

என்னை முற்றும் உயிர்உண்டு என் மாயஆக்கை இதனுள்புக்கு  
என்னை முற்றும் தானேஆய் நின்ற மாய அம்மான் சேர்  
தென்நன் திருமாலிருஞ்சோலைத் திசைகை கூப்பிச் சேர்ந்தயான்  
இன்னும் போவேனே கொலோ! என்கொல் அம்மான் திருஅருளே?

eṉṉai muṟṟum uyiruṇṭu eṉ māyaākkai itaṉuḷpukku  
eṉṉai muṟṟum tāṉēāy niṉṟa māya ammāṉ cēr  
teṉnaṉ tirumāliruñcōlait ticaikai kūppic cērntayāṉ  
iṉṉum pōvēṉē kolō! eṉkol ammāṉ tiruaruḷē?

**English translation of verse 10.7.3:**

The mysterious Sire in Tirumaliruñcōlai did my life consume in full,  
Entered He my material body and displaced me so well  
That in Him I stand transformed, heart and Soul;  
Facing south, Him I did adore with joined palms  
And His vassal have I now become,  
Shall I from here go elsewhere, leaving Him.  
What indeed is the extent of His grace supreme?

**Notes:**

\(i\) The Āḻvār re-iterates that the Lord consumed him, in full, heart and Soul, deeming it a matter of great privilege and supreme joy, as if He had attained something unattainable. Nampiḷḷai has it that the Lord’s greatness and grandeur got heightened by His contact with the Āḻvār, even as His excellence shot up, while in conjunction with Goddess Mahālakṣmī, c.f. “Yasya sā janakātmajā, aprameyaṃ hi tat tejaḥ” (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa) which says that Lord Rāma’s prowess grew up to unlimited dimensions after His union with Sītā, the daughter of King Janaka.

\(ii\) The Lord at Tirumāliruñcōlai bestowed on the Āḻvār’s physical frame boundless love, although the Āḻvār was disgustingly aware of its drawbacks and was keen, as ever, on giving it up. The Āḻvār admired the Lord whose love for him shot up to such incredible lengths, the pilgrim centre where He lovingly resided and the very direction in which it was located. Would he, therefore, think of looking beyond this favourite centre of the Lord whose hot favourite he is? It is indeed bewildering that the Lord’s love for the Āḻvār has not reached the limits of satiety, even after His mingling with him so thoroughly, displacing him, as it were, and nullifying his separate entity. The Āḻvār is aghast with wonder, at the influx of the Lord’s grace, defying description and baffling his imagination.




## 10.7.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

என்கொல் அம்மான் திருஅருள்கள்? உலகும் உயிரும் தானேயாய்  
நன்கு என் உடலம் கைவிடான் ஞாலத்தூடே நடந்து உழக்கி  
தென் கொள் திசைக்குத் திலதமாய் நின்ற திருமாலிருஞ்சோலை  
நங்கள் குன்றம் கைவிடான் நண்ணா அசுரர் நலியவே.

eṉkol ammāṉ tiruaruḷkaḷ? ulakum uyirum tāṉēyāy  
naṉku eṉ uṭalam kaiviṭāṉ ñālattūṭē naṭantu uḻakki  
teṉ koḷ ticaikkut tilatamāy niṉṟa tirumāliruñcōlai  
naṅkaḷ kuṉṟam kaiviṭāṉ naṇṇā acurar naliyavē.

**English translation of verse 10.7.4:**

What indeed is the extent of my Sire’s lovely grace!  
Unto my body He holds on with love supreme and the sacred Mount,  
Tirumāliruñ Cōlai He sticks to likewise, the crest jewel of the South,  
The Soul Supreme of all things and beings, He did traverse  
The whole Earth so as to crush the ungodly Asuras.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The text of the song, in original, refers to the Lord’s peregrination on Earth but the inner meaning thereof seems to be that, under the pretext of spanning the entire universe as Trivikrama, the Lord was actually in search of a favourite spot where He could hold uninterrupted rapport with the Āḻvār and enjoy him to His heart’s fill. Tirumāliruñcōlai was the beauty spot, thus chosen by the Lord and it is there that the Lord lavished His a ections on the Āḻvār. The Lord’s love of that place stems from the realisation of the fact that it is there that He could enjoy the Āḻvār, in the manner He did. In other words, the Lord thoroughly enjoyed the Āḻvār, body and Soul and Mount Tirumāliruñcōlai also, as the breeding ground of the Lord’s enjoyment of the Āḻvār. Incidentally, this special felicity of the Lord floored the hostile Asuras down, with envy.

\(ii\) The Sovereign Lord, above wants of any kind, is so madly in love with the Āḻvār and hankers after his material body, like unto a wayward prince lavishing his affections on a low-caste woman, literally bound to her feet. The Āḻvār euphemistically refers to the Lord’s bewilderment, as His grace, instead of curtly naming it as delusion or mental aberration.

\(iii\) As already elucidated in X-4-4, the Lord’s stay in the pilgrim centres is not an end in itself but only the means for the reclamation of His subjects, His ultimate destination being the heart-centre of the spiritually regenerated subjects.

\(iv\) *Crushing the ungodly Asuras*: This is interpreted in two ways:

(*a*) The Asuras, who prattle heresies, that is, go about shouting that the Lord is devoid of form and attributes, dwindle down with shame the moment they see the Lord in His worshippable Form in Tirumāliruñcōlai, in all His splendour.

(*b*) Those, that hitherto belittled the greatness of Saint Nammāḻvār, in terms of his parentage and all that, also shrink down with shame, when they see the Lord’s profusion of love for the Āḻvār.




## 10.7.5
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நண்ணா அசுரர் நலிவுஎய்த நல்ல அமரர் பொலிவுஎய்த  
எண்ணாதனகள் எண்ணும் நல்முனிவர் இன்பம் தலைசிறப்ப  
பண்ணார் பாடலின் கவிகள் யானாய்த் தன்னைத் தான்பாடி

paṇṇār pāṭaliṉ kavikaḷ yāṉāyt taṉṉait tāṉpāṭi  
teṉṉā eṉṉum eṉammāṉ tirumāliruñcōlaiyāṉē.

**English translation of verse 10.7.5:**

My Sire, Who into me dissolved and sang songs, sweet and chaste,  
Humming joyfully, which sealed the hostile Asuras’ fate  
But made the friendly Devas exult, which sent into raptures  
The meditative sages who keep wishing the expansion evermore,  
Of His auspicious attributes and glory great,  
Is the One who has Tirumāliruñcōlai, as His habitat.

**Notes:**

\(i\) “What a great connoisseur and how deeply interested!” exclaims the Āḻvār, when he sees the Lord who mingled with him and made him sing this great hymnal of Tiruvāymoḻi, humming with joy, as He listened to these songs.

\(ii\) The friendly Devas flourish while the Asuras, hostile and ungodly, perish, as a result of the Lord‘s incarnations. The same results are achieved by Tiruvāymoḻi also. The Lord’s devotees prosper by learning and chanting Tiruvāymoḻi while the ungodly heretics get badly exposed by this soul-stirring hymnal, cutting across their ill-conceived tenets, their false doctrines and foul rhetoric. This is best illustrated by the following episode:

Kṛmikaṇṭa, a Cōḷa king carried a crusade against Vaiṣṇavism. When his little son succeeded the felonious father, he observed, with great feeling, “Alas! what has my father done? How stupid of him to have fancied that Vaiṣṇavism could be wiped out by just demolishing a temple or two! Did he not know that, unlike the dead walls of the temple, Vaiṣṇavism is bounded by the living walls of Tiruvāymoḻi and Rāmāyaṇa, the two impregnable fortresses?”

\(iii\) At a conclave held by the sages, it was felt that there was, as yet, no hymn, which lauded adequately the Lord’s auspicious Form, attributes and cosmic wealth and that they should all pray unto the Lord to get the void duly filled up. These very sages met again after the advent of Tiruvāymoḻi. While they were jubilant that their prayers had been heard and that ‘Tiruvāymoḻi’ was the very thing they had pined for, they found that this great hymnal had covered, *in toto*, the Lord’s attributes, wealth, manifestations etc. They, therefore, wished that the Lord should have many more of these, affording scope for further laudation of them all! Here then is a grand reorientation of their intial trend of thought, which at once proclaims Tiruvāymoḻi’s greatness and grandeur as the laudatory hymnal, *par excellence*.




## 10.7.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

திருமாலிருஞ்சோலை யானேயாகி செழு மூவுலகும் தன்-

**English translation of verse 10.7.6:**

The Supreme Lord Whom even Civaṉ and Piramaṉ couldn’t attain,  
Did on them shed His grace, when they intensely adored  
His lovely feet; He did in his stomach unique sustain  
The three worlds bright, at the end of each epoch and delivered;  
That Tirumāl stands now in Tirumāliruñcōlai and is very keen  
To enlist me as His vassal, shedding on me His love supreme.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The Lord, who sustained inside His little stomach all the worlds during the deluge, now wants to sustain Himself by clinging to the Āḻvār of whom He is passionately enamoured.

\(ii\) The Lord, who is well beyond the reach of even the exalted Śiva and Brahmā, is now after the Āḻvār and it is only to get at him that He has come down to Tirumāliruñcōlai.




## 10.7.7
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

**English translation of verse 10.7.7:**

Tirumāliruñcōlai, the lovely mount, which dispels all ignorance,  
Is where stays our Lord Who is well adored with great reverence  
By the triple-eyed Sire, Piramaṉ, famed for clear intelligence,  
The Devas and their Chief and sages who steer clear of dark nescience.

**Notes:**

Seeing that Tirumāliruñcōlai is the place from where all that felicity, currently enjoyed by him, flows, the Āḻvār now adores that mountain itself, as the one that dispels ignorance and all other kindred impediments which stand between us and our destined goal. What more? It is the place coveted by the Lord who is adored by the exalted Devas, Śiva and Brahmā and enlightened sages, with deep devotion.




## 10.7.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

திருமாலிருஞ்சோலை மலையே திருப்பாற் கடலே என்தலையே

**English translation of verse 10.7.8:**

The Lord Supreme, the first cause of all things, shall not bear  
Being apart, even for a trice, from my head, held on a par  
With Mount Tirumāliruñcōlai and the Milky Ocean, my physical frame,  
Coveted by Him like the high Heaven and Mount Tiruvēṅkaṭam,  
My soul, badly mixed up with matter, my thought, word and deed.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The Āḻvār is amazed at the astounding love exhibited by the Lord unto him, rather every inch of his body, easily the aggregate of the love borne by Him for the sacred centres of front-rank eminence, like Mount Tirumāliruñcōlai, Mount Tiruvēṅkaṭam, the Milky Ocean and the High Heavens (Śrī Vaikuṇṭa). So deep and intense is the Lord’s love that He shall not brook separation from the Āḻvār’s physical frame and each anatomical part thereof, even for a split second.

\(ii\) The text of the song, as in the original, makes it out that the Lord, who lavished all His affections on each of the holy centres, referred to above, bestowed all that love on each one of the Āḻvār’s limbs exclusively. This is precisely how sage Saubhari enjoyed marital bliss with each one of his fifty wives, all at once, assuming as many forms. Each one of the fifty spouses could thus assert that her husband was in her exclusive possession and enjoyment and had nothing to do with any one else.

\(iii\) All things and beings subsist in Him, both in the primordial or the unevolved, unmanifest state as well as in the evolved, manifested condition, not being viable by themselves, otherwise than in conjunction with Him. And now, that very Lord cannot brook even a moment’s separation from the Āḻvār, as if the former subsists in the latter and cannot claim viability, on His own.




## 10.7.9
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஊழி முதல்வன் ஒருவனேஎன்னும் ஒருவன் உலகுஎல்லாம்

**English translation of verse 10.7.9:**

Lose not your hold, my mind, on Mount Tirumāliruñcōlai, Cool and lovely,  
The seat of my majestic Sire, the One and One only,  
Who did all things create, at the appropriate times,  
In sole exercise of His will, sustained and dissolved them,  
Persevering thus, may you, my mind, prosper;  
And may it please You, my Lord, to give up Your glamour  
For my body and life and see that quickly they do wither.

**Notes:**

In the seventh song of this decad, the Āḻvār adored Mount Māliruñcōlai itself, as the one from which all that bliss, currently experienced by him, flows. For that very reason, the Āḻvār now advises his mind not to relax its grip on this mascot of a mountain. On hearing the Āḻvār’s address to his mind, the Lord would appear to have addressed Himself not to give up the Āḻvār’s body, as it was in this body, out of the vast succession of bodies occupied by him, down the ages, He was able to get hold of the Āḻvār. This naturally frightens the Āḻvār who is terribly keen on the quick dissipation and disseverence of his material body. The Āḻvār, therefore, prays unto the Lord that He should no longer desire his foul body but despise it, so as to bring about the early extinction of his body and the current span of life over here. One thing is quite clear from this, namely, the Āḻvār’s prolonged existence in this abode is not due to his sins (Prārabda Karma) but due to the Lord’s overwhelming love for the Āḻvār’s physical frame, making the Āḻvār plead, as above.




## 10.7.10
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

**English translation of verse 10.7.10:**

My Lord in Tirumāliruñcōlai, You are my Saviour great,  
Become one with me; from your mysterious tangle, the agglomerate  
Of the surging senses five, the five sensory organs,  
The motor organs five, the elements five, the spirit in conjunction  
With the primordial matter, the great principle, called ‘mahān’,  
Ego and the mind, do disentangle me and deliver.

**Notes:**

\(i\) In the preceding song, the Āḻvār pleaded lustily with the Lord that He should no longer desire his foul body but despise it. But the Lord could not desist from lavishing His affections on the Āḻvār’s body. In order to remedy this state of affairs, the Āḻvār had to bring home to the Lord the unwholesome composition of his

physical body and argue his case for the discarding of this body. The Lord would not, however, easily give in; if the Āḻvār’s soul was very dear to the Lord, so was the body containing that soul. Does any one break the jar containing the costly cosmetics? Surely, the container derives its importance from the thing contained. Finding the Lord arguing along these lines, the Āḻvār had perforce to expatiate on the imperative necessity of the Lord despising his material body which, if at all any eminence could be attributed to it, is eminently fit to be discarded. This is how the Āḻvār successfully argued his case for the Lord discarding the former’s Prākṛti (material) body, right here:

“My Lord, have You not Yourself stated, in Your Song Celestial, that it is impossible for anyone to cross beyond ‘Māyā’, the ‘Prakṛti’ set up by You, which usually hinders liberation by concealing Your real nature and helps only those who have taken refuge in You? May it, therefore, please you to desist from lavishing Your affections on this prākṛtik nest, You have woven around me. I need hardly remind You that the very purpose of Your coming down here, from the high Heavens, is to bring to the fore Your special trait of subservience to Your devotees and get it stabilised. You could as well have stayed on in the yonder land, if you mean to assert Your independence even at this end, without listening to my oft-repeated request not to cling to my foul body anymore; You need not have taken the trouble to secure a foot-hold on Mount Tirumāliruñcōlai. If ‘You’ have become ‘I’ and thus established perfect identity between us, what is not palatable to me should be equally so to You. But then, You seem to be in no mood to give up Your morbid fascination for my material body. Let me now restate my case, in greater detail, so as to impress upon you the despicability of this material body, You are doting on.”

\(ii\) So saying, the Āḻvār enumerates the twenty-four principles, comprised in this material body of ours, with all its dirt and stench, but nevertheless inducing the illusory attachment to it, with its meretricious charms. In VIII-8, the Lord had impressed upon the Āḻvār, rather imparted to him the experience or realisation of the true nature of the ‘Jīva the individual soul, too subtle to be comprehended even by the enlightened yogis through strenuous mental effort. Now, it is the turn of the Āḻvār to draw the attention of the Lord to the characteristics of ‘Acit’, the inert matter, a reversal indeed of the master-disciple relationship!

**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மான்ஆங்காரம் மனம்கெட ஐவர் வன்கையர் மங்க  
தான்ஆங்கார மாய்ப்புக்கு தானே தானே ஆனானைத்  
தேனாங் காரப் பொழில்குருகூர்ச் சடகோபன் சொல்ஆயிரத்துள்  
மான்ஆங்காரத்துஇவை பத்தும் திருமாலிருஞ் சோலைமலைக்கே. (2)

tēṉāṅ kārap poḻilkurukūrc caṭakōpaṉ colāyirattuḷ  
māṉāṅkārattuivai pattum tirumāliruñ cōlaimalaikkē. (2)

**English translation of verse 10.7.11:**

These songs ten, out of the thousand composed by Caṭakōpaṉ  
Of Kurukūr, abounding in orchards lovely, which mention  
How the Lord did his body and soul lovingly enter,  
Become one with him and did his material contacts sever,  
Do unto Mount Tirumāliruñcōlai pertain.

**Notes:**

That this decad pertains to the holy centre of Tirumāliruñcōlai is evident from every song in this decad. The special significance of this fact being mentioned in this end-song can, however, be appreciated in two ways, as indicated below:

\(i\) In 11-10, the Āḻvār had referred to this holy centre, abounding in orchards, young and gay, as one of bewildering charm. The nature of the soil is such that even Nammāḻvār, endowed with knowledge, clear and perfect, by no less than the Omniscient Lord Himself, was thrown off his feet by the exquisite charm of Lord Aḻakar, enshrined in this centre and he entertained doubts whether the Lord’s glowing crown was but the upward expansion of His facial glow and the lotus seat on which He appeared to be standing was but the reflection of His dazzling feet and so on. And now, it is but the corrupting influence of that very soil that made the Lord hanker after the physical body of the Āḻvār with fantastic fascination.

\(ii\) Again, it Was due to the Lord's contact with this particular soil, that He could overcome His fascination for the Āḻvār’s material frame. The object underlying the Lord’s manifestation on this soil, in His worshippable Form as Aḻakar, is to highlight His creed of subserving His devotees. It was in pursuance of this creed that He yielded to the Āḻvār’s advice, not to caress his body any longer.

The benefit, accrued to the chanters of this decad, could be taken as the severance of the material contact with their bodies, comprising the twenty-four principles, enumerated in the tenth song, as the Āḻvār prays unto the Lord, in this decad, for such severance.
