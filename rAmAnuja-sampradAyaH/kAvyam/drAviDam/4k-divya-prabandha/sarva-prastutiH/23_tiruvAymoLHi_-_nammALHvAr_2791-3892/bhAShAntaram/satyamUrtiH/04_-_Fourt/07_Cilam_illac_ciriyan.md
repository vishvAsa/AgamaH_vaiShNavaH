## 00 Intro4.7
The Āḻvār, who was insensate in the last decad, due to the poignancy of his separation from the Lord, just regained consciousness, when the holy names of the Lord, chanted by the women around, trickled down his ears. This is like a creeper, dried up and lying low, becoming green again, when rain-drops fall on it. But then, it has only made matters worse for the Āḻvār. While in a state of coma, the patient feels no pain but when he regains consciousness, the pain becomes all the more acute. Hunger pinches a person to the marrow of his bone but luckily, sleep overtakes him. Hunger does not press its claim for the duration of his sleep but when he wakes up, the pangs of hunger are even more pronounced than before.

The Āḻvār keeps mulling how the Lord, who is a friend-in-need, capable of dispensing the appropriate remedies, could keep away from him. Unable to stand the separation, he cries out his heart so lustily that it melts down the hearts of his listeners too, as Sita did, during her captivity in Laṅkā.




## 4.7.1
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

சீலம் இல்லாச் சிறியனேலும் செய்வினையோ பெரிதால்,  
ஞாலம் உண்டாய் ஞான மூர்த்தி 'நாராயணா! என்று என்று,  
காலந்தோறும் யான் இருந்து கைதலைபூசல் இட்டால்  
கோல மேனி காண வாராய் கூவியும் கொள்ளாயே.

cīlam illāc ciṟiyaṉēlum ceyviṉaiyō peritāl,  
ñālam uṇṭāy ñāṉa mūrtti 'nārāyaṇā! eṉṟu eṉṟu,  
kālantōṟum yāṉ iruntu kaitalaipūcal iṭṭāl  
kōla mēṉi kāṇa vārāy kūviyum koḷḷāyē.

**English translation of verse 4.7.1:**

Bereft of merit, I am indeed small  
And yet, the evil in me looms large;  
Alas! respond you don’t to my lusty call  
As Nārāyaṇa, Sustainer of the worlds (during deluge),  
Knowledge incarnate, and so on, many a time, with hands lifted overhead;  
Neither do you come And let me your bewitching Form behold  
Nor do You lift me up, unto your sweet fold.

**Notes**

\(i\) Even if one did not actually do anything good, the mere thought or intention to do good things will suffice and it can yield good results. In respect of evil, however, it is only the actual commission of evil acts that is harmful and not the mere contemplation of it. And so, the Āḻvār says that he has actually perpetrated evil deeds to a very large extent and that this impedes his getting at the Lord.

\(ii\) *Knowledge incarnate*

The individual Soul also possesses knowledge but that gets perverted and puts him or her, right into the world, eking out a miserable existence, literally lame and blind. On the other hand, the Lord’s knowledge is pure and unalloyed; there is scarcely a thing He doesn’t know and nothing is beyond His capacity to do. The Individual, lame and blind, therefore, needs to be guided by the Lord. Such an obligation, on the part of the Lord, cannot be disowned by Him because He is Nārāyaṇa, in whom all things and beings subsist.

\(iii\) The Lord’s bewitching Form is intended to be seen and enjoyed by His devotees and yet, how can He stay away from the Āḻvār, like keeping a pot of nicely flavoured water out of bound, to the thirsty? The other alternative, which is only the second best, is to call him off to the heavenly abode.

\(iv\) It is noteworthy that all the five topics (Artha pañcaka) have been mentioned in this song: (1) Nārāyaṇa—the Super-Soul; (2) The small self—the Individual Soul; (3) Beckoning the Lord—The Lord is at once the ‘Means’ for attaining Him; (4) Beholding the Lord—The ‘End’ or the destined goal and (5) Large volume of evil—The impediments for the influx of the Lord’s grace.




## 4.7.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கொள்ள மாளா இன்ப வெள்ளம் கோது இல தந்திடும், என்  
வள்ளலேயோ! வையம் கொண்ட வாமனாவோ! என்று என்று,  
நள் இராவும் நன் பகலும் நான் இருந்து ஓலம் இட்டால்,  
கள்ள மாயா! உன்னை என் கண் காண வந்து ஈயாயே.

koḷḷa māḷā iṉpa veḷḷam kōtu ila tantiṭum, eṉ  
vaḷḷalēyō! vaiyam koṇṭa vāmaṉāvō! eṉṟu eṉṟu,  
naḷ irāvum naṉ pakalum nāṉ iruntu ōlam iṭṭāl,  
kaḷḷa māyā! uṉṉai eṉ kaṇ kāṇa vantu īyāyē.

**English translation of verse 4.7.2:**

Day and night, I call You out with love immense  
And ardour great, as Vāmaṉa, Who the worlds did measure,  
The Donor great, Who on revelling devotees confers  
Bliss unlimited with no reserve and Yet there’s no response  
Oh, elusive Lord, You deign not to come and feast my eyes.

**Note**

When the Āḻvār refers to the Lord as the great Donor, conferring limitless bliss, he is only recalling his own experience in IV-5, a painful contrast indeed, with the present predicament. If, as Vāmaṉa, He could beg of Bali and get back the lost territory for Indra, the self-seeker, should the Lord withhold Himself from a selfless devotee like the Āḻvār who seeks none but the Lord Himself?




## 4.7.3
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

'ஈவு இலாத தீவினைகள் எத்தனை செய்தனன்கொல்?  
தாவி வையம் கொண்ட எந்தாய்! தாமோதரா! என்று என்று  
கூவிக் கூவி நெஞ்சு உருகி கண்பனி சோர நின்றால்,  
பாவி நீ என்று ஒன்று சொல்லாய் பாவியேன் காண வந்தே.

'īvu ilāta tīviṉaikaḷ ettaṉai ceytaṉaṉkol?  
tāvi vaiyam koṇṭa entāy! tāmōtarā! eṉṟu eṉṟu  
kūvik kūvi neñcu uruki kaṇpaṉi cōra niṉṟāl,  
pāvi nī eṉṟu oṉṟu collāy pāviyēṉ kāṇa vantē.

**English translation of verse 4.7.3:**

Endless sins I should have indeed committed,  
Therefore it is, You come not before this sinner,  
At least to say so, though I call You out many times over,  
With melting heart and teaiful eyes, as my Lord,  
Who measured the worlds and Tāmōtarā, (got bound by a cord).

**Note**

The Āḻvār lustily calls out the Lord, stressing alternately His transcendent glory when He measured all the regions, high and low, in just three strides, and His amazing simplicity as the naughty child (Tāmōtarā), whose tummy was bound by a rope, as a punishment for stealing butter. It matters not to him whether the Lord calls Him a Saint or a Sinner and even if the Lord wants to despise him as a sinner, the Āḻvār would want Him to come, face to face, and say so, as he will then have the pleasure of seeing Him. Even if the Lord would not appear before the Āḻvār, the latter will be pleased if the Lord could tell, within his hearing, that he is a despicable sinner. The Āḻvār will then have the satisfaction of hearing the Lord’s voice.




## 4.7.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

'காண வந்து என் கண்முகப்பே தாமரைக்கண் பிறழ,  
ஆணி செம்பொன் மேனி எந்தாய்! நின்று அருளாய் என்று என்று,  
நாணம் இல்லாச் சிறு தகையேன் நான் இங்கு அலற்றுவது என்,  
பேணி வானோர் காணமாட்டாப் பீடு உடை அப்பனையே?

'kāṇa vantu eṉ kaṇmukappē tāmaraikkaṇ piṟaḻa,  
āṇi cempoṉ mēṉi entāy! niṉṟu aruḷāy eṉṟu eṉṟu,  
nāṇam illāc ciṟu takaiyēṉ nāṉ iṅku alaṟṟuvatu eṉ,  
pēṇi vāṉōr kāṇamāṭṭāp pīṭu uṭai appaṉaiyē?

**English translation of verse 4.7.4:**

To come up to me, shamelessly do I beckon, all the time,  
The redoubted Lord, even (Brahmā and other Devas) seeking Him  
Can hardly behold, of the hue of red gold, pure and fine,  
That this mean fellow may on His lotus eyes feast, how futile!

**Notes**

\(i\) In aspiring to behold the Supreme Lord, beyond the reach of even Brahmā and other Devas seeking Him ardently, the Āḻvār feels that he is attempting the impossible. And yet, he calls Him out all the time, because of his deep yearning.

\(ii\) The cloud-hued Lord is referred to here, as of the complexion of red gold. The comparison is not on all fours and what is intended to convey is that the Lord’s complexion is just as attractive as red gold of the highest refinement. It could also be that the gold complexion of the Divine Mother is reflected on His person, turning it also into gold colour.




## 4.7.5
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அப்பனே! அடல் ஆழியானே, ஆழ் கடலைக் கடைந்த  
துப்பனே, உன் தோள்கள் நான்கும் கண்டிடக்கூடுங்கொல்? என்று  
எப்பொழுதும் கண்ண நீர் கொண்டு ஆவி துவர்ந்து துவர்ந்து,  
இப்பொழுதே வந்திடாய் என்று ஏழையேன் நோக்குவனே.

appaṉē! aṭal āḻiyāṉē, āḻ kaṭalaik kaṭainta  
tuppaṉē, uṉ tōḷkaḷ nāṉkum kaṇṭiṭakkūṭuṅkol? eṉṟu  
eppoḻutum kaṇṇa nīr koṇṭu āvi tuvarntu tuvarntu,  
ippoḻutē vantiṭāy eṉṟu ēḻaiyēṉ nōkkuvaṉē.

**English translation of verse 4.7.5:**

Oh, Benefactor great, my potent Lord, holding the discus valiant.  
The ocean deep you did churn and delivered the nectar,  
Eager to behold your lovely shoulders four, I want  
You to come up to me right now; tears welling up for ever.  
Greedily do I look around my Soul drying up, again and again,

**Notes**

\(i\) The Āḻvār exclaims how greedy he is trying to see the Lord, inaccessible even to the exalted Brahmā and other Devas, and that too, right now. But then, he longs to see the Lord's shoulders unlike the Devas who were, all the time, looking at the ocean for the nectar to come up, foregoing the pleasure of beholding the Lord moving around with His thousand shoulders, gaily bedecked with exquisite garlands. With the prior knowledge of  
His condescending love unto Gajendra and Prahlāda, the Āḻvār is so certain of the Lord’s unfailing response that he keeps looking around for Him all the time.

\(ii\) *The greedy looks*: Here is a thrilling anecdote. Krimikaṇṭa, a cōḻa king, was a rash bigot of Śaivism. He launched a crusade of religious persecution and forcibly compelled every one to sign a bull, he had proclaimed, to the effect that there was no other God but Śiva. Kūrat-tāḻvāṉ, an intimate disciple of Śrī Rāmānuja, was also ordered to sign the declaration in the Royal court. He not only declined to do so but vindicated the supremacy of Lord Viṣṇu, quoting chapter and verse. The enraged king, however, ordered Āḻvāṉ’s eyes to be gouged but Āḻvān plucked out his eyes himself, exclaiming that the pair of eyes which had the misfortune to see the wicked king, weren’t worth having any more. When Śrī Rāmānuja got to know about this later, his heart bled at this catastrophe and he intensely longed for the restoration of Āḻvāṉ’s eye-sight. At the Master’s command, the blinded Āḻvāṉ composed hymns lauding Lord Varadaraja, enshrined in Kāñchīpuram, known as ‘Varadarāja Stava’ when the verses were read out by Āḻvāṉ to Śrī Rāmānuja, the latter rejoiced, in particular, when he came upon the twenty-second verse, and burst out, “Āḻvāṉ, when the Lord listens to this particular verse, He cannot but grant you the vision to behold Him. Well, turn this side, let me scan your face, right now”. This anecdote illustrates the firm belief of the devotees that the Lord will surely respond to such a moving submission.




## 4.7.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நோக்கி நோக்கி உன்னைக் காண்பான் யான் எனது ஆவியுள்ளே,  
நாக்கு நீள்வன் ஞானம் இல்லை நாள்தோறும் என்னுடைய,  
ஆக்கையுள்ளும் ஆவியுள்ளும் அல்ல புறத்தினுள்ளும்,  
நீக்கம் இன்றி எங்கும் நின்றாய்! நின்னை அறிந்து அறிந்தே.

nōkki nōkki uṉṉaik kāṇpāṉ yāṉ eṉatu āviyuḷḷē,  
nākku nīḷvaṉ ñāṉam illai nāḷtōṟum eṉṉuṭaiya,  
ākkaiyuḷḷum āviyuḷḷum alla puṟattiṉuḷḷum,  
nīkkam iṉṟi eṅkum niṉṟāy! niṉṉai aṟintu aṟintē.

**English translation of verse 4.7.6:**

What a fool am I to hold out my tongue (and in my heart)  
Long to behold Your form exquisite and for You look around,  
Knowing full well that You who pervade all round  
And at all times, my body, soul, limbs and other parts,  
With no exception, will not unto me Your grace impart!

**Notes:**

\(i\) *Āḻvār to the Lord*: “My Lord, You don’t make yourself visible unto poor me, despite Your pervading among other things my entire being, because You are not so inclined. This is quite evident and yet, I keep looking for You in all directions, like the innocent children aspiring for things they can’t have, holding out their tongues all the time, unable to conceal their longing. Of course, as You are aware, seeing You is an end in itself, as far as I am concerned.

\(ii\) Here is a juicy observation of Nampiḷḷai: Like unto a person having plenty of money, tied up in bundles and kept inside, still wandering about in search of money outside, with aching legs (swollen), the Āḻvār is not contented with the enjoyment of the Lord in His full complement inside him, and tires himself out, looking for Him outside!




## 4.7.7
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அறிந்து அறிந்து தேறித் தேறி யான் எனது ஆவியுள்ளே,  
நிறைந்த ஞான மூர்த்தியாயை நின்மலமாக வைத்து,  
பிறந்தும் செத்தும் நின்று இடறும் பேதைமை தீர்ந்தொழிந்தேன்  
நறுந் துழாயின் கண்ணி அம்மா! நான் உன்னைக் கண்டுகொண்டே!

aṟintu aṟintu tēṟit tēṟi yāṉ eṉatu āviyuḷḷē,  
niṟainta ñāṉa mūrttiyāyai niṉmalamāka vaittu,  
piṟantum cettum niṉṟu iṭaṟum pētaimai tīrntoḻintēṉ  
naṟun tuḻāyiṉ kaṇṇi ammā! nāṉ uṉṉaik kaṇṭukoṇṭē!

**English translation of verse 4.7.7:**

Oh, Sire, sporting the tuḷaci garland fragrant,  
(My mind) could behold You and knowing You full well  
(As the ‘Means’ and the ‘End’ combined), I do revel  
With all clarity and in my heart immaculate  
Is my nescience which gave rise to birth and death.

**Note**

*Lord to the Āḻvār*: Oh, Āḻvār, why do you vex yourself in this manner as though I have done you nothing? Can’t you recollect at least a few things you have got from Me?

*Alvar to the Lord*: My Lord, I wouldn’t fail to acknowledge the many favours you have done me. you have of course imparted to me knowledge, clear and concise, free from imperfections and blemishes of any kind, and further clarified it by impressing upon me Your transcendent glory, easy-worshippability, easy-accessibility, readiness to forgive, the pre-eminence of your ‘Arca’ (iconic manifestation) etc. With my nescience thus rooted out, I also stand rid of the terrific involvement in the cycle of birth and death. I also enjoy your vision mentally; you are perfect knowledge personified. And yet, how can ī rest contented unless I came face to face with you?




## 4.7.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கண்டுகொண்டு என் கைகள் ஆர நின் திருப்பாதங்கள்மேல்,  
எண் திசையும் உள்ள பூக்கொண்டு ஏத்தி உகந்து உகந்து,  
தொண்டரோங்கள் பாடி ஆட சூழ் கடல் ஞாலத்துள்ளே,  
வண் துழாயின் கண்ணி வேந்தே! வந்திடகில்லாயே.

kaṇṭukoṇṭu eṉ kaikaḷ āra niṉ tiruppātaṅkaḷmēl,  
eṇ ticaiyum uḷḷa pūkkoṇṭu ētti ukantu ukantu,  
toṇṭarōṅkaḷ pāṭi āṭa cūḻ kaṭal ñālattuḷḷē,  
vaṇ tuḻāyiṉ kaṇṇi vēntē! vantiṭakillāyē.

**English translation of verse 4.7.8:**

Oh, Sovereign Master, bedecked with tuḷaci garlands comely.  
Why don’t you appear before me in this very land,  
By ocean surrounded, that I can feast on Your Form lovely,  
Gather choice flowers from everywhere and with my hands  
Offer them lustily at Your holy feet and laud you in a chorus,  
Singing and dancing with delight immense?

**Note**

Having enumerated in the preceding song, the favours already received by him from the Lord, the Āḻvār now lists out what he stills needs from Him. The eyes, hitherto starved, must feast on His nectarean charm, the hands which remained idle so far, should be fully engaged in gathering flowers from all the eight directions and offering them at the feet of the Lord to his heart’s content; seeing the Lord’s delight, he and his fellow-devotees should give vent to their joy, singing and dancing. Without deferring all this enjoyment till he reaches heaven, he should be enabled to have it all, right here. When one feels enormously thirsty, the thirst needs to be quenched there and then; there is hardly any point in extending a promise to relieve the thirst some time later, at some other place. The Lord is required to present Himself before the Āḻvār, right here, in all that heavenly splendour, which is precisely what the Celestials drink deep all the time. This, he has been praying for, since long, and yet, the Lord hasn’t responded. This sums up the present plight of the Āḻvār.




## 4.7.9
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

இடகிலேன் ஒன்று அட்ட கில்லேன் ஐம்புலன் வெல்ல கில்லேன்,  
கடவன் ஆகி காலந்தோறும் பூப்பறித்து ஏத்த கில்லேன்,  
மட வல் நெஞ்சம் காதல் கூர வல்வினையேன் அயர்ப்பாய்த்,  
தடவுகின்றேன் எங்குக் காண்பன் சக்கரத்து அண்ணலையே?

iṭakilēṉ oṉṟu aṭṭa killēṉ aimpulaṉ vella killēṉ,  
kaṭavaṉ āki kālantōṟum pūppaṟittu ētta killēṉ,  
maṭa val neñcam kātal kūra valviṉaiyēṉ ayarppāyt,  
taṭavukiṉṟēṉ eṅkuk kāṇpaṉ cakkarattu aṇṇalaiyē?

**English translation of verse 4.7.9:**

Alms I gave not, nor did I allay to any extent  
The thirst of others, the senses five I kept not under restraint,  
Flowers I offered not unto the Lord at the appropriate time,  
Rash and hard-hearted, an impudent fool I am,  
Sinner heavy, I am still fondly groping thro’, to get hold  
Of the Lord, wielding the discus; Him where shall I behold?

**Notes**

The Āḻvār puts himself the question whether he, who did not pursue the disciplines of ‘Karma-yoga’ etc, had at all the ‘Means’ to get at the Lord. All the above-mentioned omissions and transgressions notwithstanding, the Āḻvār fondly hopes to get hold of the Lord, gripping the discus even as Queen Yaśodhā caught hold of Śrī Kṛṣṇa red handed while gripping (stealing) butter.




## 4.7.10
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

சக்கரத்து அண்ணலே என்று தாழ்ந்து கண்ணீர் ததும்ப,  
பக்கம் நோக்கி நின்று அலந்தேன் பாவியேன் காண்கின்றிலேன்,  
மிக்க ஞான மூர்த்தி ஆய வேத விளக்கினை என்  
தக்க ஞானக் கண்களாலே கண்டு தழுவுவனே.

cakkarattu aṇṇalē eṉṟu tāḻntu kaṇṇīr tatumpa,  
pakkam nōkki niṉṟu alantēṉ pāviyēṉ kāṇkiṉṟilēṉ,  
mikka ñāṉa mūrtti āya vēta viḷakkiṉai eṉ  
takka ñāṉak kaṇkaḷālē kaṇṭu taḻuvuvaṉē.

**English translation of verse 4.7.10:**

With tears welling up my eyes, I looked around,  
But sinner that I am, I remain worn out and frustrated;  
Behold I don’t my Sire, holding the discus and yet, in my mind,  
Him I see and embrace, fed by Knowledge appropriate,  
The One who is supreme knowledge personified, by Vedas illumined.

**Note**

If, in spite of all the efforts of the Āḻvār to see the Lord outwardly, He abstained from the Āḻvār the other alternative would be for him to forget all about the Lord and carry on as before. But then, the Lord has endowed the Āḻvār with the appropriate knowledge and is perpetually in front of his mind’s eye. Forgetting the Lord is, therefore, out of the question. And so, there are two distinct facets in the Āḻvār, namely, God-love (Prema) and knowledge (Jñāna); the former makes him intensely long for external perception of the Lord, formal worship with flowers etc, as distinguished from a mere mental rapport with the Lord, which always subsists by virtue of the Alvar’s profound knowledge (Jñāna)




## 4.7.11
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

தழுவிநின்ற காதல் தன்னால் தாமரைக் கண்ணன் தன்னை,  
குழுவு மாடத் தென் குருகூர் மாறன் சடகோபன், சொல்  
வழுவு இலாத ஒண் தமிழ்கள் ஆயிரத்துள் இப்பத்தும்,  
தழுவப் பாடி ஆட வல்லார் வைகுந்தம் ஏறுவரே.

taḻuviniṉṟa kātal taṉṉāl tāmaraik kaṇṇaṉ taṉṉai,  
kuḻuvu māṭat teṉ kurukūr māṟaṉ caṭakōpaṉ, col  
vaḻuvu ilāta oṇ tamiḻkaḷ āyirattuḷ ippattum,  
taḻuvap pāṭi āṭa vallār vaikuntam ēṟuvarē.

**English translation of verse 4.7.11:**

Those that sing with zeal and revel in these songs ten,  
Out of the thousand flawless Tamil songs bright of Caṭakōpaṉ,  
Chief of Teṉkurukūr with a cluster of castles,  
Adoring the lotus-eyed Lord with love inexhaustible,  
Will the high Heavens scale (and enjoy bliss perennial).

**Notes**

\(i\) The lotus-eyed Lord having blessed the Āḻvār, right inside his mother’s womb, the Āḻvār emerged into this world with God-love, ingrained in him.

\(ii\) The clustering of houses in Kurukūr would, *ipso facto*, denote the clustering of people, in that town. A juicy explanation for such crowding, furnished in ‘Iṭu’, is that the Lord’s advent in Kurukūr was expected any moment, in view of the Āḻvār’s inordinate longing and people clustered around him to watch the great event. There is a strong parallel to this in Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa. At the end of his long exile Śri Rāma met Sage Bharadvāja [Bharadwaja] at the latter’s āśram, enroute to Ayodhya and enquired about Bharata’s welfare. The sage replied: “Yes, all are well; anxiously awaiting your return, Bharata is spending sleepless days and nights, smeared with mud raised by torrential tears from his eyes falling on the ground”. If Bharata is in such a forlorn state, how could all be well there? What the Sage emphasises here is that the Intensity of Bharatha’s dev tion was such that it inspired robust confidence in the citizens that Śrī Rāma would hasten his home-coming and So, they had all gatheṟed, in great glee, to greet him.
