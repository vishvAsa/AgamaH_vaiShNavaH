## 00 Intro6.10
In the last decad, the Āḻvār voiced forth, in deep anguish, his inordinate longing for communion with the Lord, so as to be audible to Him, right in Heaven. And yet, there has been no response from the Lord and the Āḻvār is, therefore, in a state of extreme mental distress and physical debility. He is, however, quick to realise that the Lord stands enshrined in holy Tiruvēṅkaṭam (Andhra Pradesh), the common meeting ground of the ‘Nitya Sūrīs’ (Eternal Heroes in Heaven), the ‘Nitya Samsārīs’ (worldlings), birds and beasts. At this holy centre, the Āḻvār seeks refuge at the feet of the Lord through the good offices of the Divine Mother, inseparably poised on His winsome chest, voicing forth his sole dependence on Him. In the first nine songs of this decad, the Āḻvār dwells upon the glory and grandeur of the Lord, the Great Saviour, and, in the tenth, he surrenders at His feet, the Sole Refuge. No doubt, the Āḻvār had surrendered himself earlier also at the feet of the Lord, enshrined in other Pilgrim centres, c.f. IV-9, V-7 and V-8, but there is as much difference between those and the one currently resorted to, as between ‘Tirumantram’ and ‘Dvayam While the holy conjunction of Mahālakṣmī, the Divine Mother and the Lord is but implicit in the former, it is explicit in the latter, as in this decad, vide tenth song.




## 6.10.1
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

உலகம் உண்ட பெருவாயா! உலப்பு இல் கீர்த்தி அம்மானே,  
நிலவும் சுடர் சூழ் ஒளி மூர்த்தி! நெடியாய் அடியேன் ஆர் உயிரே,  
திலதம் உலகுக்கு ஆய் நின்ற திருவேங்கடத்து எம் பெருமானே,  
குல தொல் அடியேன் உன பாதம் கூடும் ஆறு கூறாயே.

ulakam uṇṭa peruvāyā! ulappu il kīrtti ammāṉē,  
nilavum cuṭar cūḻ oḷi mūrtti! neṭiyāy aṭiyēṉ ār uyirē,  
tilatam ulakukku āy niṉṟa tiruvēṅkaṭattu em perumāṉē,  
kula tol aṭiyēṉ uṉa pātam kūṭum āṟu kūṟāyē.

**English translation of verse 6.10.1:**

My Lord at Tiruvēṅkaṭam, the bright vermilion mark on Cosmos’ face!  
With Your mammoth mouth You gulped down the whole Universe  
And thus retrieving it, gained peerless fame;  
Of supernal form resplendent, Thou art Supreme,  
Dearest unto me, Your humble vassal from generations,  
To attain Your feet, Your grace I invoke with veneration.

### Notes

\(i\) The Āḻvār prays that he should be enabled to enjoy the beatific bliss, in close proximity to the Lord at Tiruvēṅkaṭam. The Āḻvār’s grief, in not being able to get at the Lord’s feet, calls for the same attention on His part, as the great deluge when He did sustain all the worlds, with their contents, inside His stomach. All that fame, He derived by that great gesture, will be totally nullified in case He didn’t relieve the Āḻvār’s distress.

\(ii\) The great Saviour is indeed large-mouthed, as the Āḻvār puts it. Pledged to protect the supplicants who seek refuge in Him, He goes the whole hog out and still does not feel satisfied that He has done enough for them, as in the case of Draupati—an *insatiable hunger for protecting those who seek protection*. At His bidding, enemies turn friends. A serpent, named Sumukha, sought Lord Kṛṣṇa’s refuge and protection against the fearful raids of Garuḍa, the tribal enemy of the serpent race. The Lord vouchsafed protection to Sumukha, invited Garuḍa and consigned the former to the latter’s care. Garuḍa, the inveterate enemy, had thus to lay aside his racial enmity and befriend Sumukhā; the erstwhile oppressor becomes the protector, oh, how potent is the Lord’s will!




## 6.10.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கூறாய் நீறு ஆய் நிலன் ஆகி கொடு வல் அசுரர் குலம் எல்லாம்,  
சீறா எரியும் திரு நேமி வலவா! தெய்வக் கோமானே,  
சேறார் சுனைத் தாமரை செந்தீ மலரும் திருவேங்கடத்தானே,  
ஆறா அன்பில் அடியேன் உன் அடிசேர் வண்ணம் அருளாயே.

kūṟāy nīṟu āy nilaṉ āki koṭu val acurar kulam ellām,  
cīṟā eriyum tiru nēmi valavā! teyvak kōmāṉē,  
cēṟār cuṉait tāmarai centī malarum tiruvēṅkaṭattāṉē,  
āṟā aṉpil aṭiyēṉ uṉ aṭicēr vaṇṇam aruḷāyē.

**English translation of verse 6.10.2:**

Oh, Supreme Lord, residing in Tiruvēṅkaṭam in whose cloddy ponds  
The lotus blossoms fiery red and holding in Your right hand,  
The hissing discus effulgent, which cut, burnt and razed to the ground  
Hordes of monstrous Rākṣasas, pray shed Your grace sweet  
Unto me of limitless love, to enable me to attain Your feet.

### Notes

\(i\) The Āḻvār prays unto the Lord holding the discus, the great destroyer of all enemies, to destroy his enemies also and take him unto His lovely feet, so that His stay on mount Tiruvēṅkaṭam could indeed be fruitful.

\(ii\) The Āḻvār’s God-love is an inexhaustible fountain which won’t dry up even if the ponds in Tiruvēṅkaṭam went dry; that is because all that knowledge, which blossomed into intellectual love of God, was dowered on him by the Lord Himself. (1-1-1).




## 6.10.3
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வண்ணம் மருள் கொள் அணி மேக வண்ணா! மாய அம்மானே,  
எண்ணம் புகுந்து தித்திக்கும் அமுதே! இமையோர் அதிபதியே,  
தெள் நல் அருவி மணி பொன் முத்து அலைக்கும் திருவேங்கடத்தானே,  
அண்ணலே! உன் அடிசேர அடியேற்கு ஆஆ என்னாயே!

vaṇṇam maruḷ koḷ aṇi mēka vaṇṇā! māya ammāṉē,  
eṇṇam pukuntu tittikkum amutē! imaiyōr atipatiyē,  
teḷ nal aruvi maṇi poṉ muttu alaikkum tiruvēṅkaṭattāṉē,  
aṇṇalē! uṉ aṭicēra aṭiyēṟku āā eṉṉāyē!

**English translation of verse 6.10.3:**

Oh, Lord of Celestials, beaming in Tiruvēṅkaṭam, whose cascades clear and lovely,  
Bring in rubies, gold and pearls in plenty,  
Of wondrous traits, my cloud-hued Sire! grace personified You are,  
My heart you do sweeten as you enter,  
Take pity on me and let me your feet attain, my Master!

### Note

The Lord at Tiruvēṅkaṭam is the very embodiment of grace; He, who imparted unalloyed knowledge to the Āḻvār, resulting in his single-minded devotion to the Lord, should also help him to attain His feet. This is the humble submission of the Āḻvār.




## 6.10.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஆவா வென்னாது உலகத்தை அலைக்கும் அசுரர் வாழ் நாள்மேல்,  
தீ வாய் வாளி மழை பொழிந்த சிலையா! திரு மா மகள் கேள்வா-  
தேவா சுரர்கள் முனிக்கணங்கள் விரும்பும் திருவேங்கடத்தானே,  
பூ ஆர் கழல்கள் அருவினையேன் பொருந்துமாறு புணராயே.

āvā veṉṉātu ulakattai alaikkum acurar vāḻ nāḷmēl,  
tī vāy vāḷi maḻai poḻinta cilaiyā! tiru mā makaḷ kēḷvā-  
tēvā curarkaḷ muṉikkaṇaṅkaḷ virumpum tiruvēṅkaṭattāṉē,  
pū ār kaḻalkaḷ aruviṉaiyēṉ poruntumāṟu puṇarāyē.

**English translation of verse 6.10.4:**

Oh, Tirumāmakaḻ’s Spouse Divine, residing in Tiruvēṅkaṭam,  
Adored by sages and Celestials, in strength, arrows spitting fire,  
You, great Archer, did on the unrelenting Acurar shower,  
Teach this sinner dire how to attain Your florid feet, my Sanctum.

### Notes

\(i\) The Āḻvār tells the Lord that none of the means, outlined in the Śāstras for attaining His feet, has been of any avail to him and that He should, therefore, teach him yet another way, implying thereby that, for him, the Lord should at once be the ‘Means’ and the ‘End’, the path and the goal.

A disciple of Nañcīyar caused him great mental pain by questioning the need for the act of Surrender to God (plainly indicative of something done, out of one’s own free will), if God is our only Means of salvation and there is nothing for us to do. It is a pity, the questioner did not receive the sacred truth of ‘Prapatti’, resignation to God. in good faith and failed to appreciate the spirit underlying it, namely, our free-will inclining to God’s grace is itself due to His grace. Nañcīyar regretted very much that he should have passed on to the questioner (not truly responsive) this sacred truth, handed down, as a holy legacy, through an unbroken succession of preceptors. Smiting his palm against his forehead, he retired to his private chamber, moved with pity and sorrow at the obduracy of men’s hearts in not receiving and understanding such sacred truths, in their proper perspective.

\(ii\) *Unrelenting Acurar*: The Asuras are the ungodly, who inflict miseries on their fellow-beings. The great Nañcīyar taught his disciples to distinguish the Godly from the otherwise, as follows: We may console ourselves as related to God, if our hearts are moved with compassion when any ill befalls others; if, on the other hand, we gloat over others’ miseries, surely, we are cast away from Him.




## 6.10.5
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

புணரா நின்ற மரம் ஏழ் அன்று எய்த ஒரு வில் வலவா ஓ,  
புணர் ஏய் நின்ற மரம் இரண்டின் நடுவே போன முதல்வா ஓ,  
திணர் ஆர் மேகம் எனக் களிறு சேரும் திருவேங்கடத்தானே,  
திணர் ஆர் சார்ங்கத்து உன பாதம் சேர்வது அடியேன் எந்நாளே?

puṇarā niṉṟa maram ēḻ aṉṟu eyta oru vil valavā ō,  
puṇar ēy niṉṟa maram iraṇṭiṉ naṭuvē pōṉa mutalvā ō,  
tiṇar ār mēkam eṉak kaḷiṟu cērum tiruvēṅkaṭattāṉē,  
tiṇar ār cārṅkattu uṉa pātam cērvatu aṭiyēṉ ennāḷē?

**English translation of verse 6.10.5:**

Thou art the unique Archer, Whose shaft once sped  
Thro’ the *Sal* trees seven huddled together,  
The Primate Who ‘twixt the twin (*Maruta*) trees crawled,  
And art now in Tiruvēṅkaṭam where elephants do gather,  
Akin to dense clouds; My Lord, wielding the bow mighty.  
When shall this vassal reach Thy feet doughty?

### Notes

\(i\) The Lord would appear to have told the Āḻvār that He was surely taking him to His abode in Heaven; the expectant Āḻvār is, however, not satisfied with a general assurance of this kind and insists that a date be set for the consummation.

\(ii\) It can be both ways, namely, elephants gathering like clouds and clouds gathering like elephants, in that holy mountain. The Lord, enshrined there, is Himself referred to, as the cloud adorning the crest of Veṅkaṭādri (Mount Tiruvēṅkaṭam)—“Śrī Veṅkaṭādri śikharālaya Kāḷamekhaṃ”. Saint Tirumaṅkai Āḻvār also refers to the Lord at Tiruvēṅkaṭam as the Elephant, adorning the North.

\(iii\) The mighty bow in the Lord’s hand is quite reassuring and the Āḻvār is, therefore, sanguine of attaining to His feet. All that He wants now is that the Lord should graciously specify the point of time at which he would be lifted up.




## 6.10.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

,எந்நாளே நாம் மண் அளந்த இணைத் தாமரைகள் காண்பதற்கு என்று,  
எந்நாளும் நின்று இமையோர்கள் ஏத்தி இறைஞ்சி இனம் இனமாய்,  
மெய்ந் நா மனத்தால் வழிபாடு செய்யும் திருவேங்கடத்தானே,  
மெய்ந் நான் எய்தி எந்நாள் உன் அடிக்கண் அடியேன் மேவுவதே?

,ennāḷē nām maṇ aḷanta iṇait tāmaraikaḷ kāṇpataṟku eṉṟu,  
ennāḷum niṉṟu imaiyōrkaḷ ētti iṟaiñci iṉam iṉamāy,  
meyn nā maṉattāl vaḻipāṭu ceyyum tiruvēṅkaṭattāṉē,  
meyn nāṉ eyti ennāḷ uṉ aṭikkaṇ aṭiyēṉ mēvuvatē?

**English translation of verse 6.10.6:**

Enshrined in Tiruvēṅkaṭam where do wait reverently, days on end,  
Groups of Celestials, to worship Your lotus feet, the pair that spanned  
The Universe, and meditate on You by word, deed and thought,  
Oh, Lord! when shall this vassal, in reality, attain Your feet?

### Note

There was indeed no need for the Lord to set a date for His union with the Āḻvār, as desired by him, in the preceding song; he could very well enjoy that bliss, right here, at Tiruvēṅkaṭam, where even ‘Nitya Sūrīs’ come down from Heaven and worship. And so, he would not like to miss that bliss, near at hand.




## 6.10.7
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அடியேன் மேவி அமர்கின்ற அமுதே! இமையோர் அதிபதியே,  
கொடியா அடு புள் உடையானே! கோலக் கனிவாய்ப் பெருமானே,  
செடி ஆர் வினைகள் தீர் மருந்தே! திருவேங்கடத்து எம் பெருமானே,  
நொடி ஆர் பொழுதும் உன பாதம் காண நோலாது ஆற்றேனே

aṭiyēṉ mēvi amarkiṉṟa amutē! imaiyōr atipatiyē,  
koṭiyā aṭu puḷ uṭaiyāṉē! kōlak kaṉivāyp perumāṉē,  
ceṭi ār viṉaikaḷ tīr maruntē! tiruvēṅkaṭattu em perumāṉē,  
noṭi ār poḻutum uṉa pātam kāṇa nōlātu āṟṟēṉē

**English translation of verse 6.10.7:**

You are the Nectar, by this vassal enjoyed, Oh, Lord of Celestials,  
On Your banner is Garuḍa Who the enemies burns out, for dense ills  
You are the panacea, Oh, Lord at Tiruvēṅkaṭam, Your lips attractive  
Like unto lovely fruit, I am eager to behold; I am indeed restive.  
Brooking no delay, not a trice, in worshipping Your feet,  
Although I have to my credit no special rite.

### Notes

\(i\) It is the insatiable Nectar, deeply imbedded in the mind of the Āḻvār, that he hastens to behold physically. All this flutter, on his part, is not because of any misgiving regarding the attainment of the goal but because of his inability to brook the delay in getting at it, overwhelmed by its grandeur.

\(ii\) ‘*The Nectar by this vassal enjoyed*’, is yet another addition to the long list of the Lord’s holy names, similar to the one coined by the Āḻvār earlier, ‘*The One in me mingled*’, vide II-5-2. The Nectar, enjoyed by the Āḻvār, is indeed far superior to the one said to have been enjoyed by the Devas, a mere salt extract, in comparison to the current enjoyment of the Āḻvār, and, for the matter of that, the Āḻvār’s manner of enjoyment is unique, by-no-means comparable with that of others.

\(iii\) This song (as per the text in the original) is being chanted by the devout while making offerings of dishes to the Lord, as part of worship, as ordained by Śrī Parāśara Bhaṭṭar.




## 6.10.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நோலாது ஆற்றேன் உன பாதம் காண என்று நுண் உணர்வின்,  
நீல் ஆர் கண்டத்து அம்மானும் நிறை நான்முகனும் இந்திரனும்,  
சேல் ஏய் கண்ணார் பலர் சூழ விரும்பும் திருவேங்கடத்தானே,  
மாலாய் மயக்கி அடியேன்பால் வந்தாய் போலே வாராயே.

nōlātu āṟṟēṉ uṉa pātam kāṇa eṉṟu nuṇ uṇarviṉ,  
nīl ār kaṇṭattu ammāṉum niṟai nāṉmukaṉum intiraṉum,  
cēl ēy kaṇṇār palar cūḻa virumpum tiruvēṅkaṭattāṉē,  
mālāy mayakki aṭiyēṉpāl vantāy pōlē vārāyē.

**English translation of verse 6.10.8:**

My Lord, dwelling in Tiruvēṅkaṭam, unto you do resort  
The revered blue-necked Sire (Śiva) of intelligence acute,  
Nāṉmukaṉ, of knowledge consummate, and Intiraṉ, saying that inadequate  
Is their equipment to worship Your feet and with their consorts  
Of bewitching looks, they eagerly serve You; pray do appear  
Before this dependant, as did the entrancing Kaṇṇaṉ before His parents dear.

### Note

Apprehending the possibility of the Lord keeping aloof, in view of the inadequacy, rather, absence of any equipment, worth the name, in the Āḻvār, referred to by him already, in the preceding song, he now claims parity, in this regard, with those in the higher echelons. Even the Celestials, at the top, suffer from inadequacy in this respect, despite their massive learning, acute intellect and great prowess. Still, they do come down to Tiruvēṅkaṭam, along with their consorts, to serve the Lord, with great zeal.




## 6.10.9
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வந்தாய் போலே வாராதாய்! வாராதாய் போல் வருவானே,  
செந்தாமரைக் கண் செங்கனிவாய் நால் தோள் அமுதே! எனது உயிரே,  
சிந்தாமணிகள் பகர் அல்லைப் பகல்செய் திருவேங்கடத்தானே,  
அந்தோ அடியேன் உன பாதம் அகலகில்லேன் இறையுமே.

vantāy pōlē vārātāy! vārātāy pōl varuvāṉē,  
centāmaraik kaṇ ceṅkaṉivāy nāl tōḷ amutē! eṉatu uyirē,  
cintāmaṇikaḷ pakar allaip pakalcey tiruvēṅkaṭattāṉē,  
antō aṭiyēṉ uṉa pātam akalakillēṉ iṟaiyumē.

**English translation of verse 6.10.9:**

Oh, Lord at Tiruvēṅkaṭam, where gems of unique sheen  
Make the night shine like day, You are seemingly near, yet far.  
But when (in despair), You seem afar, You draw near;  
With lotus eyes red. lips like ripe fruit, Your Form nectarean.  
With shoulders four, is unto me dearest; from Your feet,  
Alas! this humble lover cannot, for a moment, be apart.

### Notes

\(i\) The gems could refer either to those in the sacred Mount or those embedded in the Jewels on the Lord’s person.

\(ii\) The Āḻvār’s mental vision of the Lord was so full and complete that he could easily mistake it for physical perception, in three dimensions; when, out of deep yearning, he held out his arms for embracing the Lord, he would be disillusioned, rather extremely disappointed. Again, at a time, when the Āḻvār would not have the faintest hope of enjoying the Lord’s vision, the Lord would suddenly present Himself before his mind’s eye. As a matter of fact, we have witnessed such fluctuations and vicissitudes, all along.




## 6.10.10
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அகலகில்லேன் இறையும் என்று அலர்மேல் மங்கை உறை மார்பா,  
நிகர் இல் புகழாய் உலகம் மூன்று உடையாய்! என்னை ஆள்வானே,  
நிகர் இல் அமரர் முனிக்கணங்கள் விரும்பும் திருவேங்கடத்தானே,  
புகல் ஒன்று இல்லா அடியேன் உன் அடிக்கீழ் அமர்ந்து புகுந்தேனே.

akalakillēṉ iṟaiyum eṉṟu alarmēl maṅkai uṟai mārpā,  
nikar il pukaḻāy ulakam mūṉṟu uṭaiyāy! eṉṉai āḷvāṉē,  
nikar il amarar muṉikkaṇaṅkaḷ virumpum tiruvēṅkaṭattāṉē,  
pukal oṉṟu illā aṭiyēṉ uṉ aṭikkīḻ amarntu pukuntēṉē.

**English translation of verse 6.10.10:**

Oh, Resident of Tiruvēṅkaṭam, reverently sought by the peerless Amarars  
And sages in their bunches, on Your winsome chest inheres  
The Divine Mother who from a flower emerged, ever saying that  
From You she shall not for a moment be apart;  
Of incomparable glory, You are the Lord of all the three worlds,  
And at Your feet lovely, this vassal squarely takes refuge, with no other hold.

### Notes

\(i\) In the preceding nine songs, the Āḻvār described the Lord’s greatness and grandeur and also gave vent to his deep yearning to get at Him. And now, he takes refuge at the Lord’s feet, seeking the good offices of the Divine Mother, ever present on the Lord’s chest, so as to accelerate his union with the Lord. While doing so, he gives expression to his abject destitution and exclusive dependence on the Lord. It has to be noted that the Āḻvār is still seated in lotus pose, inside the hollow of the tamarined tree at Tirunakari. Of the three types of ‘Prapatti’, surrender to the Lord’s loving grace, by word, deed or thought, this one falls under the first category, ‘vācika’ (Añjali, paramā mudrā kṣipraṃ Devaprasādinī).

\(ii\) The Divine Mother, Lakṣmī, the lotus-born, is inseparably poised on the Lord’s chest and yet, why should she keep uttering the words, “From you, I shall not, for a moment, be apart”? As the saying goes, “A thing is too good to last long”. No wonder, in the exuberance of her enjoyment of the Lord’s nectarean person, the Mother is, side by side, haunted by the fear of getting dislodged from this exhilarating milieu and hence, her constant submission, as above.




## 6.10.11
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அடிக்கீழ் அமர்ந்து புகுந்து அடியீர் வாழ்மின் என்று என்று அருள்கொடுக்கும்  
படிக் கேழ் இல்லாப் பெருமானைப் பழனக் குருகூர்ச் சடகோபன்,  
முடிப்பான் சொன்ன ஆயிரத்துத் திருவேங்கடத்துக்கு இவை பத்தும்,  
பிடித்தார் பிடித்தார் வீற்றிருந்து பெரிய வானுள் நிலாவுவரே.

aṭikkīḻ amarntu pukuntu aṭiyīr vāḻmiṉ eṉṟu eṉṟu aruḷkoṭukkum

muṭippāṉ coṉṉa āyirattut tiruvēṅkaṭattukku ivai pattum,  
piṭittār piṭittār vīṟṟiruntu periya vāṉuḷ nilāvuvarē.

**English translation of verse 6.10.11:**

Those that recite or listen to these songs ten,  
Which unto holy Tiruvēṅkaṭam pertain,  
Out of the thousand sung by Kurukūr Caṭakōpaṉ,  
To cut out worldly ties, in sweet adoration  
Of the peerless Lord, Who His feet exhibits for ever,  
Exhorting the devotees to take refuge therein,  
Will in High Heaven for ever remain.

**Notes**

\(i\) The thousand songs were sung by Saint Nammāḻvār, stung by the severe fright of the worldly distractions and the mischief of the unruly senses, in order to cut out the worldly ties, vide also VI-9-9.

\(ii\) These ten songs are made over to Tiruvēṅkaṭam, out of the thousand, meant, as a whole, to adore Lord Raṅganātha, enshrined in the walled city of Śrīraṅgam.

\(iii\) The Lord at Tiruvēṅkaṭam stands in a unique pose, His right hand pointing to the dazzling feet below, to show that there and there alone lies our salvation. It is worth recalling, in this context, sloka 110 of the first centum, in Śrī Parāśara Bhaṭṭar’s Śrī Raṅgarāja Stavam, “Kirīṭaṃ Śrī Raṅge śayithuḥ........................”.

It is said that, in His reclining posture, Lord Raṅganātha is touching the crown on His head with one hand, while the other hand, stretching down to His knee, points to His lotus feet; the former proclaims His overlordship, the supreme sovereignty over Brahmā, Śiva and all else, while the latter reveals His easy accessibility, offering His lotus feet, as the sole Refuge of His devotees.




## Retrospective Summary
(6-1): *In the opening decad of this centum*, the Lord seeks out the Lord, in His worshippable Form at Tiruvaṇvaṇṭūr (in Kerala State). Being too feeble to reach that place, the Āḻvār, once again transformed as the Nāyakī, in a forlorn state, sends some birds and bees to convey her message to the Lord, in His Incarnate Form (a gathered from the tenth song of this decad), invoking His pledge to extend protection to His devotees;

(This is the second of the four decads in the whole work, where the Āḻvār (*transformed as Nāyakī*) sends emissaries to the Lord at various destinations, to convey her message to Him; the earlier one is I-4 and the later ones are VI-8 and IX-7).

(6-2): In response to the message sent, as in the opening decad, the Lord eventually presents Himself before the Nāyakī who is, however, seen, *in the second decad*, resenting His delayed appearance. With the characteristic feminine jealousy and rancour, the Nāyakī arraigns the Lord for having apparently strayed elsewhere, making love to the damsels of His special preference, and asks Him to go back to them. This is virtually a re-enactment of Kṛṣṇa-Gopīs episode of Śrīmad Bhāgavatam; the rancour of the overzealous Gopīs would obviously not last long, being but an interim facet of connubial relationship, culminating in the reunion of the all-conquering Lover and His beloveds;

(6-3): The Saint keeps musing over the superior might of the Lord, in having got him round, despite his stout resolve not to have anything to do with that malingering defaulter, any more. The Lord reveals to the Āḻvār His extraordinary capacity for achieving the impossible and reconciling the incompatibles besides the glorious Iconic Form in which He stays in Tiruviṇṇakar (in Tamil Nadu, near Tirukkuṭantai, already covered in V-8). The Āḻvār recounts his current experience, *in the third decad*;

(6-4): His erstwhile emotional break-down and exhaustion having yielded place to exhilaration, we see the Āḻvār recounting, *in the fourth decad*, the Lord’s glorious deeds and activities besides giving vent to his extraordinary joy, resulting from such recital *cum* contemplation. The Āḻvār concludes each song, in this decad, by showering on himself praises like “There is none equal to me in all the land”, “There is none above me” etc., expressions of an ecstatic mind, dissolved in God-love;

(6-5): *In the fifth decad*, the Nāyakī’s (Āḻvār’s) mates tell the elderly women around about the profusion of the Nāyakī’s love unto the Lord, enshrined in Tolaivillimaṅkalam (deep south in Tamil Nadu). The mates keep guessing whether the Nāyakī could be but Nappiṇṇai (Lord Kṛṣṇa’s favourite Consort) reborn or an Incarnation of Mother Earth, full of grace or Mahālakṣmī Herself;

(6-6): The gnostic mother speaks out, *in the sixth decad*, the desperate condition of her love-lorn daughter (Āḻvār); the manner in which the latter is dwindling down, losing, one by one, her feminine charms and embellishments. As the Nāyakī meditates on the wondrous deeds performed by the Lord in each of His various incarnations and the special traits, then exhibited by Him, she goes into raptures and her body thaws down and dwindles;

(6-7); The mother continues her narration—*in the seventh decad* also, voicing forth the Nāyakī’s extraordinary devotion to the Lord at Tirukkōḷūr (a pilgrim centre, also deep south, in Tamil Nadu), her inordinate longing for incessant communion with Him;

(6-8): The Nāyakī, who set out for the coveted Tirukkōḷūr, could not reach the place, bogged down, *en route*, due to her intense God-love; stranded half-way through, she sends messages through birds etc., *as in the eighth decad*, to the Lord in His ‘Para’ (transcendent) and ‘Antaryāmi’ (hidden form as Internal Controller of all beings), invoking His trait of ‘aikarasya’ (feeling of oneness with His devotees);

(This is the third decad of this pattern, the earlier ones being I-4 and VI-1; one more, namely, IX-7 will follow).

(6-9): His errands, as in the eighth decad, not having evoked the desired response, the Āḻvār raises, *in the ninth decad*, his own clarion call of deep yearning, reaching the very heaven, with robust faith in the fruition of his full-throated call for deliverance;

(6-10): In the ninth decad, the Āḻvār voiced forth, in deep anguish, his inordinate longing for communion with the Lord, so as to be audible to Him, right in the high Heaven. And yet, there has been no response from the Lord, reducing the Āḻvār to a state of extreme mental distress and physical debility. Heis, however, quick to realise that the Lord stays, in His worshippable Form, in holy Tiruvēṅkaṭam (Andhra Pradesh), the common meeting ground of ‘Nitya Sūrīs’ (ever-free angels in Heaven), the ‘Samsārīs’ (worldlings) on Earth, birds and beasts. *In the first nine songs of the concluding centum of this decad*, the Āḻvār dwells upon the glory and grandeur of the Lord, the great Saviour and, *in the tenth*, he seeks refuge at the feet of the Lord, through the good offices of Lakṣmī, the Divine Mother, inseparably poised on His winsome chest, voicing forth his sole dependence on Him.
