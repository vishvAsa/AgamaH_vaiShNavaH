## 00 Intro3.2
We have only to imagine the pangs of a person unable to quench his extreme thirst, notwithstanding the availability of plenty of water near at hand, just because his mouth is sealed up (like Tantalus in the Greek legend). We will then be able to appreciate the most unenviable predicament in which the Āḻvār found himself, suffering from the figurative lock-jaw. Here is the Lord in His worshiṛpable form, of insatiable beauty, near at hand, and yet, the Āḻvār is not able to comprehend and enjoy Him as well as He would like to, severely handicapped as he is, by the heavy limitations inherent in his earthly existence, tethered to this material body. No doubt, the Lord, in His unbounded mercy, has dowered on us limbs and sense-organs to impart mobility and put us on a career of gainful activity. Not stopping with this alone, He condescended to present Himself before the Subjects during His Avatāras and mixed with them freely. And yet, all these benefits do not currently fill the Āḻvār’s bill. On the other hand, he is regretting his inability to enjoy the Lord, in His ‘Arcā’ (Iconic manifestation), *in toto*, and give the fullest expression to such enjoyment. God is limitless but the Saint has his limitations although his craving is very great.

The present agony of the Āḻvār is thus due to his inability to limit the limitless, rather, the small range of the powers of his mind and the senses vis-a-vis the enjoyment of the boundless beatific vision of the Lord. It is, however, seen that, towards the end of this decad, the Lord consoles the Āḻvār by telling him that the Celestials, shorn of material contacts, are also on the same footing as the Āḻvār and they too have their limitations. The Āḻvār is, however, beckoned by the Lord to enjoy His iconic form at Tiruvēṅkaṭam, to his heart’s content. Thus consoled, the Āḻvār ends this decad on a happy note.

When Śrī Parāśara Bhaṭṭar discoursed on this song, his younger brother, Śrīrāmappiḷḷai raised the following point.

> “I find that the Āḻvār’s distress is neither due to his longing for
> the heavenly bliss, right from here, nor due to his craving for the
> enjoyment of God in His incarnations in by-gone times. His distress
> seems to have arisen after the Lord was pleased to grant him the
> enjoyment of His worshippable (Arcā) form as Aḻakar, in ‘Tirumāliruñ
> Cōlai’, when, in fact, one should have expected him to go on revelling
> in the enjoyment of the Lord, so sweet and exquisite. It is indeed
> puzzling in this context how the anguish has, at all, arisen”.

The illustrious Bhaṭṭārya elucidated, as follows:

> “The different manifestations (Para, Vyūha, Vibhava, Antaryāmi and
> Arcā) of one and the same God cannot affect His Solidarity. God is
> immense and infinite. When His beatific vision was presented to the
> Saint through the medium of Aḷakar he could enjoy it only as much as
> his limited capacity could permit, even as one visualises the vast
> ocean, only as much as the eye apprehends. Here then is the tussle
> between the Āḻvār’s limited capacity, on the one hand, and his
> enormous longing on the other, and the resultant mental agony”.




## 3.2.1
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

முந்நீர் ஞாலம் படைத்த எம் முகில் வண்ணனே,  
அந் நாள் நீ தந்த ஆக்கையின்வழி உழல்வேன்,  
வெம் நாள் நோய் வீய வினைகளை வேர் அறப் பாய்ந்து,  
எந் நாள் யான் உன்னை இனி வந்து கூடுவனே? (2)

munnīr ñālam paṭaitta em mukil vaṇṇaṉē,  
an nāḷ nī tanta ākkaiyiṉvaḻi uḻalvēṉ,  
vem nāḷ nōy vīya viṉaikaḷai vēr aṟap pāyntu,  
en nāḷ yāṉ uṉṉai iṉi vantu kūṭuvaṉē? (2)

**English translation of verse 3.2.1:**

My cloud-hued Lord, You raised this world,  
Surrounded by oceanic waters; in this body, by you dowered  
Stray do I, pursuing its (errant) ways; I know not when  
My ills will be rooted out and you I shall attain.

**Notes**  

[*Ālvār to the Lord*:]—

\(i\) “I was like a wingless bird aṇd by giving me the limbs etc., you capacitated me for a career of gainful activity. But alas! the body, so kindly dowered by you, was misused by me and I have got all miseries heaped on my head. Now that I can hardly brook any separation from you, when will my deadly sins, the impediments for my union with you, be rooted out and our union be hastened?

\(ii\) Empār is said to have lamented: “This boat of a body, dowered by you, could have been steered through to heavenly bliss but, alas! I have allowed it to be swept away by (worldly) current and capsize into the mire of sensual pleasures.

\(iii\) When Saints talk of ills (sickness and pain), it is not any kind of physical malady, such as remittent fever but the pain of separation from God.




## 3.2.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வன் மா வையம் அளந்த எம் வாமனா, நின்  
பல்மா மாயப் பல் பிறவியில் படிகின்ற யான்,  
தொல் மா வல்வினைத் தொடர்களை முதல் அரிந்து,  
நின் மா தாள் சேர்ந்து நிற்பது எஞ்ஞான்றுகொலோ?

vaṉ mā vaiyam aḷanta em vāmaṉā, niṉ  
palmā māyap pal piṟaviyil paṭikiṉṟa yāṉ,  
tol mā valviṉait toṭarkaḷai mutal arintu,  
niṉ mā tāḷ cērntu niṟpatu eññāṉṟukolō?

**English translation of verse 3.2.2:**

My Lord Vāmaṉā, You measured the Worlds, vast and strong,  
Caught up in the meshes of varied births and still lingering,  
When will my sins, hoary and violent, be rooted out  
And I remain stable at your lovely feet?

**Note**  

[*Lord to the Āḻvār*:]—

> “Well, if you couldn’t go to me, I came to you, spanned the whole
> universe, high and low, and set my feet on one and all, with no
> distinction of rich and poor, Saint or debauchee, land and water”.

[*Ālvar to the Lord*:]—

> “Sire, it is a pity, even then, I was out of your reach. In spite of
> your initial help in endowing me with a body to eke out a promising
> career, I got myself drowned in the ocean of Saṃsāra. Again, when you
> sought me out, as Vāmana, I drifted to another part of the ocean, very
> much beyond your reach and failed to avail of that golden opportunity
> of mass benefit”.




## 3.2.3
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கொல்லா மாக்கோல் கொலைசெய்து பாரதப் போர்,  
எல்லாச் சேனையும் இரு நிலத்து அவித்த எந்தாய்,  
பொல்லா ஆக்கையின் புணர்வினை அறுக்கல் அறா,  
சொல்லாய் யான் உன்னைச் சார்வது ஓர் சூழ்ச்சியே.

kollā mākkōl kolaiceytu pāratap pōr,  
ellāc cēṉaiyum iru nilattu avitta entāy,  
pollā ākkaiyiṉ puṇarviṉai aṟukkal aṟā,  
collāy yāṉ uṉṉaic cārvatu ōr cūḻcciyē.

**English translation of verse 3.2.3:**

My Master! With a (mere) non-lethal horse-whip in your hand  
You routed the armies in this vast land,  
(Earth’s wholesome burden) in Bhārat’s battle great,  
May you spell out the means for cutting out  
My contact with this fell body, difficult to cut,  
So that I do attain your lovely feet.

**Notes**

\(i\) It is sheer ignorance to hold that the great battle of Mahā Bhārata was won by the Pāṇḍavas. Actually it was Lord Kṛṣṇa, who got Mother Earth rid of her unwholesome burden, and it was indeed the purpose of His incarnation. Barring a few, on both sides (the five Pāṇḍavas, Aśvattāma, Kṛpācārya and Kṛtavarmā), all the rest were annihilated and it was all the work of Śrī Kṛṣṇā’s whip. With no other weapon in hand, the Master strategist directed and controlled the military strategy at every turn and made it possible for the Pāṇdavas to claim victory. A mere chariot driver holding the horse whip, He ostensibly was, and yet, Arjuna thoughtfully leaned on Him, fully conscious of the basic truth that, where Lord Kṛṣṇa is, there and there, success is. On the other hand. Duryodhana who had been advised by the grand old Bhīṣmācār [Bhīṣmācārya?] to seek Śrī Kṛṣṇa’s help and enlist Him on the side of the Kauravas, did make a formality of an appointment with Śrī Kṛṣṇa, but decided to give Him up, on being told that He was all alone, with no fighting force behind. The sagacious Bhīṣma regretted this fatal decision of Duryodhana and sent him back to Śrī Kṛṣṇa to extract an assurance from Him that He would not wield any weapon during the battle. The Lord readily agreed and, therefore it is, that Nammāḻvār says, in this song, that it was the mere horse-whip in the hand of the Divine Charioteer that proved so deadly.

\(ii\) The Saint laments that he had, not only missed the benefit of the Lord’s incarnation as ‘Vāmana’ but also that of Kṛṣṇāvatāra, the proximate one.




## 3.2.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

சூழ்ச்சி ஞானச் சுடர் ஒளி ஆகி, என்றும்  
ஏழ்ச்சி கேடு இன்றி எங்கணும் நிறைந்த எந்தாய்,  
தாழ்ச்சி மற்று எங்கும் தவிர்ந்து நின் தாள் இணைக்கீழ்  
வாழ்ச்சி, யான் சேரும் வகை அருளாய் வந்தே.

cūḻcci ñāṉac cuṭar oḷi āki, eṉṟum  
ēḻcci kēṭu iṉṟi eṅkaṇum niṟainta entāy,  
tāḻcci maṟṟu eṅkum tavirntu niṉ tāḷ iṇaikkīḻ  
vāḻcci, yāṉ cērum vakai aruḷāy vantē.

**English translation of verse 3.2.4:**

My Lord, your radiant knowledge surrounds  
One and all, you neither contract nor expand,  
You pervade all over, at all times; do come and tell  
How I can, thoughts other than you, dispel  
And at your lovely pair of feet dwell (and revel.)

**Note**

[*Āḻvār to the Lord*:]—

> “My Lord, let alone my failure to benefit by your Avatāras, as Vāmana
> and Kṛṣṇa. Even your Omnipresence, and omniscience, directed towards
> the uplift of your subject, has not delivered the goods in my case. It
> is now up to you to devise other ways of redeeming mt, if need be,
> through yet another incarnation, wholly for my sake.”




## 3.2.5
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வந்தாய் போலே வந்தும் என் மனத்தினை நீ,  
சிந்தாமல் செய்யாய் இதுவே இது ஆகில்,  
கொந்து ஆர் காயாவின் கொழு மலர்த் திருநிறத்த  
எந்தாய், யான் உன்னை எங்கு வந்து அணுகிற்பனே?

vantāy pōlē vantum eṉ maṉattiṉai nī,  
cintāmal ceyyāy ituvē itu ākil,  
kontu ār kāyāviṉ koḻu malart tiruniṟatta  
entāy, yāṉ uṉṉai eṅku vantu aṇukiṟpaṉē?

**English translation of verse 3.2.5:**

My Lord, like unto the bunchy flower red is your complexion grand,  
Should you persist in denying me your helping hand  
And fail to restrain my wandering mind,  
How can I, on my own, attain you indeed?  
Pray do appear before me, as you did  
(For the sake of Gajendra and Prahlāda).

**Note**

In the preceding song, the Āḻvār requested the Lord to incarnate once more for his sake. The Lord tells the Āḻvār that, as Śrī Rāma, He was in this abode for eleven thousand years and, as Śrī Kṛṣṇa, He stayed here for one hundred years. It would be pretty difficult for Him to incarnate again. The Āḻvār, however, pleads that the Lord should incarnate for his sake, at least for a few days, and if it wasn’t possible, He could at least put in His appearance, as He did for Gajendra and Prahlāda. The Āḻvār cannot brook separation from the Lord because he cannot refrain from enjoying His exquisite beauty. And by himself, he canrot reach Him and hence the request, as above.




## 3.2.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கிற்பன் கில்லேன் என்று இலன் முனம் நாளால்,  
அற்ப சாரங்கள் அவை சுவைத்து அகன்றொழிந்தேன்,  
பற்பல் ஆயிரம் உயிர் செய்த பரமா, நின்  
நற் பொன் சோதித்தாள் நணுகுவது எஞ்ஞான்றே?

kiṟpaṉ killēṉ eṉṟu ilaṉ muṉam nāḷāl,  
aṟpa cāraṅkaḷ avai cuvaittu akaṉṟoḻintēṉ,  
paṟpal āyiram uyir ceyta paramā, niṉ  
naṟ poṉ cōtittāḷ naṇukuvatu eññāṉṟē?

**English translation of verse 3.2.6:**

I did nothing good in the days of yore, nor desist from evil.  
Away from you strayed I and got absorbed,  
In pleasures petty; myriads of Souls at your sweet will  
You could animate, oh, potent Lord,  
When shall I your feet resplendent attain?

**Note**  

[*Alvar to the Lord*:]—

> “My Lord, I am guilty, both ways, not doing any good that will take me
> unto your lovely feet and at the same time, not desisting from evil,
> which puts me very much away from you. I strayed away from you, doing
> things as I liked. Seeing what you have done to myriads of souls for
> their uplift, 1 am sure I would not be asking of you too much if I
> prayed that you should redeem me and make me fit to attain your
> lustrous feet”.




## 3.2.7
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

எஞ்ஞான்றும் நாம் இருந்து இருந்து இரங்கி நெஞ்சே!  
மெய்ஞ்ஞானம் இன்றி வினை இயல் பிறப்பு அழுந்தி,  
எஞ்ஞான்றும் எங்கும் ஒழிவு அற நிறைந்து நின்ற,  
மெய்ஞ் ஞானச் சோதிக் கண்ணனை மேவுதுமே?

eññāṉṟum nām iruntu iruntu iraṅki neñcē!  
meyññāṉam iṉṟi viṉai iyal piṟappu aḻunti,  
eññāṉṟum eṅkum oḻivu aṟa niṟaintu niṉṟa,  
meyñ ñāṉac cōtik kaṇṇaṉai mēvutumē?

**English translation of verse 3.2.7:**

My mind, sunk deep in ignorance and sin  
We have been journeying thro’ births for ever;  
Shall we ever attain Kaṇṇaṉ,  
The lustrous Lord omniscient, who for ever pervades all over?

**Note**

Mention of the Lord’s resplendent feet, in the preceding song, set the Āḻvār’s mind throbbing for them and now the Āḻvār hastens to disabuse his mind, sunk deep in age-long ignorance and accumulated sins, of its ill-conceived ambition.




## 3.2.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மேவு துன்ப வினைகளை விடுத்துமிலேன்,  
ஓவுதல் இன்றி உன் கழல் வணங்கிற்றிலேன்,  
பாவு தொல் சீர்க் கண்ணா! என் பரஞ்சுடரே,  
கூவுகின்றேன் காண்பான் எங்கு எய்தக் கூவுவனே?

mēvu tuṉpa viṉaikaḷai viṭuttumilēṉ,  
ōvutal iṉṟi uṉ kaḻal vaṇaṅkiṟṟilēṉ,  
pāvu tol cīrk kaṇṇā! eṉ parañcuṭarē,  
kūvukiṉṟēṉ kāṇpāṉ eṅku eytak kūvuvaṉē?

**English translation of verse 3.2.8:**

1 didn’t extricate myself from sins that breed miseries many  
Nor did I your holy feet worship continually;  
My beloved Kaṇṇā of radiance supreme and grace in-born,  
To behold you, the all-pervading, I call you out, now and again,  
But you, where and how can I attain?

**Note**  

[*Āḻvār to the Lord*:]—

> “Sire, all along, I have been providing grist for the grinding mill of
> my senses but little did I do for my advancement. And now, I call you
> out, as if I have the necessary qualification to meet you. But you are
> everywhere, and in me too; you make me pounce upon your auspicious
> traits so natural to you that they attract even a sinner like me”.




## 3.2.9
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கூவிக் கூவிக் கொடுவினைத் தூற்றுள் நின்று  
பாவியேன் பல காலம் வழி திகைத்து அலமர்கின்றேன்,  
மேவி அன்று ஆ நிரை காத்தவன் உலகம் எல்லாம்,  
தாவிய அம்மானை எங்கு இனித் தலைப்பெய்வனே?

kūvik kūvik koṭuviṉait tūṟṟuḷ niṉṟu  
pāviyēṉ pala kālam vaḻi tikaittu alamarkiṉṟēṉ,  
mēvi aṉṟu ā nirai kāttavaṉ ulakam ellām,  
tāviya ammāṉai eṅku iṉit talaippeyvaṉē?

**English translation of verse 3.2.9:**

Caught up in worldly life dense,  
The breeding ground for dire sins,  
I missed my track and for ages groped,  
Many a time do I call my Sire, who once shepherded,  
The cows and all the worlds measured,  
Where and how shall I get Him indeed?

**Note**  

[*Āḻvār to the Lord*:]—

> “My Lord, as Śrī Kṛṣṇa, you protected the cows in the pastoral village
> of Gokula and not a drop of rain fell on them although it was pouring
> down with mad fury for a whole week. And then, when you spanned the
> entire universe, as Tṛvikrama, you set your lovely feet on one and all
> but I eluded you, even then. Having missed such a golden opportunity,
> where is the hope of salvation for me? Even so, I am not in a position
> to give you up, as it would be attempting the impossible, and I,
> therefore, keep on calling you. You will certainly hear me all right
> and respond too, by stretching out your helping hand. But then, I am
> sunk so deep that I am possibly out of your reach!”




## 3.2.10
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

தலைப்பெய் காலம் நமன்தமர் பாசம் விட்டால்,  
அலைப்பூண் உண்ணும் அவ் அல்லல் எல்லாம் அகல,  
கலைப் பல் ஞானத்து என் கண்ணனைக் கண்டுகொண்டு,  
நிலைப் பெற்று என் நெஞ்சம் பெற்றது நீடு உயிரே

talaippey kālam namaṉtamar pācam viṭṭāl,  
alaippūṇ uṇṇum av allal ellām akala,  
kalaip pal ñāṉattu eṉ kaṇṇaṉaik kaṇṭukoṇṭu,  
nilaip peṟṟu eṉ neñcam peṟṟatu nīṭu uyirē

**English translation of verse 3.2.10:**

Miseries gruesome, like unto yama’s yoke have ended,  
And seen have I kaṇṇaṉ, my beloved Lord,  
By many a sacred text comprehended;  
My mind is steady and my soul restored,  
To pristine purity, its due stature.

**Notes**

\(i\) Śrī Nampiḷḷai elucidates the context of this song, as follows:

Finding the Āḻvār in an extremely critical condition, the Lord calls upon him to enjoy His Iconic Form in Tiruvēṅkaṭaṃ and sustain himself. Thereupon, the Āḻvār feels greatly relieved and gives vent to his sense of relief, in this song.

\(ii\) Being away from the Lord is as gruesome as suffering from Yama’s yoke, the tortures inflicted by Yama’s hordes.

\(iii\) Tirukkurukaippirāṉ Piḷḷāṉ, in his commentary known as Aṟāyirappaṭi, presents the current scene of reunion of the Lord and the Saint as follows:

The Lord seems to have got frightened of His own loss of reputation when an ardent devotee, who has taken refuge at His feet, is left in the lurch, exposed to the vagaries of Yama’s assistants. C.F. Śloka 25, of Saint Yāmuna’s Stotra Ratna.




## 3.2.11
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

உயிர்கள் எல்லா உலகமும் உடையவனைக்,  
குயில் கொள் சோலைத் தென் குருகூர்ச் சடகோபன்,  
செயிர் இல் சொல் இசை மாலை ஆயிரத்துள் இப் பத்தும்,  
உயிரின்மேல் ஆக்கை ஊனிடை ஒழிவிக்குமே. (2)

uyirkaḷ ellā ulakamum uṭaiyavaṉaik,  
kuyil koḷ cōlait teṉ kurukūrc caṭakōpaṉ,  
ceyir il col icai mālai āyirattuḷ ip pattum,  
uyiriṉmēl ākkai ūṉiṭai oḻivikkumē. (2)

**English translation of verse 3.2.11:**

These songs ten, in the hymnal garland of thousand, Chaste and sweet,  
Knit by Caṭakōpaṉ of Kurukūr in whose orchards Koels go gay,  
In adoration of the Sovereign Master of all the worlds and their beings,  
Will rid (the chanters) of their fleshy shackles.

**Notes**

\(i\) The Āḻvār invests the Lord and the surroundings with his own feelings. Now that he has been put back on his feet, he sees in the Lord a special aura, and His ownership of all things and souls now becomes more pronounced, with the resuscitation of the Āḻvār himself.

\(ii\) Kurukūr is described, in this song, as a lovely place abounding in orchards, where koels sing merrily. When the Āḻvār was sunk in dejection due to separation from the Lord, the Koels had also lapsed into silence. Now that the Āḻvār is happy, these birds also sing sweet strains, as before.
