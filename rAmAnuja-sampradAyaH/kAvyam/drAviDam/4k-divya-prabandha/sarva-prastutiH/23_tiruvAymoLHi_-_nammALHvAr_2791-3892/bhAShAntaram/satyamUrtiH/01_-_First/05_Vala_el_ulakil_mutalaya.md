## 00 Intro1.5
In each of the preceding four decads, the Āḻvār has highlighted a particular trait of the Lord. These are exaltation (transcendent glory), Worship-worthiness, easy-accessibility (saulabhya) and forgiveness, respectively. In this decad, the Saint brings into focus the Lord’s condescension (sauśīlya), mixing freely with the lowliest, the crowning trait of the Lord, heading the list of sixteen traits mentioned by Śrī Vālmīki, in his poser at the very beginning of Rāmāyaṇa[^1]. Śrī Rāma’s rapport with Guhā, the hunter, and intimate association with the monkeys, Vibhīṣaṇa etc., illustrate this.

[^1]:  “konvasmin sāmprataṃ ḷoke, guṇavāṅ, kaśca vīryavān” etc., etc.

When, in response to the heart-rending, rather, heart-warming appeal of the Āḻvār, in the preceding decad, the Lord presented Himself before the Āḻvār, in all His grandeur, betokening the enormity of His grace unto the Āḻvār, one should have expected the latter to just jump in and get himself locked up in the Lord’s sweet embrace. But what did he do? The Āḻvār beheld, with bewildering amazement, the Lord, in His full splendour, in dire contrast to his own littleness, a very picture of oppressive contrast indeed, oppressive because he dared not defile and desecrate the Great One, taking undue advantage of His condescending love. And so, he attempted to run away from the Lord, a very strange behaviour for which the only possible explanation is that he just got drifted into such a mental complex at the mere thought of the Lord’s transcendent glory. Such alternating extremes of behaviour are, however, noticeable in Saint Yāmuṉa, Kūratṭāḻvāṉ and his illustrious son, Śrī Parāśara Bhaṭṭar also. As a matter of fact, the draw-backs in us serve as the foil against which the Lord’s ‘Sauśīlya’ (condescension) shines all the more.





## 1.5.1
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வள ஏழ் உலகின் முதலாய வானோர் இறையை அருவினையேன்-  
களவேழ் வெண்ணெய் தொடு உண்ட கள்வா! என்பன்; பின்னையும்  
தளவு ஏழ் முறுவல் பின்னைக்கு ஆய் வல் ஆன் ஆயர் தலைவனாய்  
இள ஏறு ஏழும் தழுவிய எந்தாய்! என்பன் நினைந்து நைந்தே.

vaḷa ēḻ ulakiṉ mutalāya vāṉōr iṟaiyai aruviṉaiyēṉ-  
kaḷavēḻ veṇṇey toṭu uṇṭa kaḷvā! eṉpaṉ; piṉṉaiyum  
taḷavu ēḻ muṟuval piṉṉaikku āy val āṉ āyar talaivaṉāy  
iḷa ēṟu ēḻum taḻuviya entāy! eṉpaṉ niṉaintu naintē.

**English translation of verse 1.5.1:**

How dare I, a deep-rooted sinner, meditate  
On the Lord of all the worlds and Heaven and narrate  
The mystery of His stealing butter and taming bulls,  
As a cow-herd boy for the hand of Piṉṉai. the damsel  
Of bewitching smile, and (pretend to) thaw down in ecstasy?

**Note**

The Āḻvār, in his present mood of self-denouncing humility, feels that he has defiled and desecrated the Supreme Lord by word, when he recounted His mysterious deeds and addressed Him as ‘My Sire’, by thought, when he meditated on Him, and by deed, when he melted down, in ecstasy, as it were, a mockery of devotion.




## 1.5.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நினைந்து நைந்து உள் கரைந்து உருகி இமையோர் பலரும் முனிவரும்  
புனைந்த கண்ணி நீர் சாந்தம் புகையோடு ஏந்தி வணங்கினால்  
நினைந்த எல்லாப் பொருள்கட்கும் வித்துஆய் முதலில் சிதையாமே  
மனம் செய் ஞானத்து உன் பெருமை மாசூணாதோ? மாயோனே!

niṉaintu naintu uḷ karaintu uruki imaiyōr palarum muṉivarum

niṉainta ellāp poruḷkaṭkum vittuāy mutalil citaiyāmē  
maṉam cey ñāṉattu uṉ perumai mācūṇātō? māyōṉē!

**English translation of verse 1.5.2:**

Oh, wonderful Lord, You are the supreme architect  
Of all things conceivable and yet immutable you are!  
Will it not from your glory great detract  
If (Brahmā and other) Devas, Sages and others  
(Your creatures all) meditate on you, thaw down and unto You offer  
Flowers, sandal paste, sacramental water and incense burn?

**Notes**

\(i\) In this stanza, the Āḻvār realises that he is unfit even to say that he has defiled the Lord, What is his title, cither way, to dabble in God-head? It is something like a person, who, by reason of his birth, is precluded from learning the Vedas, saying that he has not learnt the Vedas, as if he has failed to learn a thing he is entitled to learn. This feeling of the Āḻvār could be inferred from his present observation that even the worship offered through their triple faculties of word, deed and thought, by the exalted Devas, like Brahmā, and Sages of the eminence of Sanaka, pales into insignificance and would only detract from His great glory, as the Supreme Architect of all. It is little better than a team of ants worshipping the majestic lion.

\(ii\) Once the seed is sown, what comes up is the tree; cotton disappears, when turned into thread which again disappears, when turned into a fabric. But it redounds to the great glory of the Lord, one of His many marvels, that He remains unchanged despite His being the material cause of the entire universe. Well, What glory is there in His being worshipped by His own creatures? It would make sense only if the Lord is worshipped by persons of comparable stature but alas! there is none falling in this category.




## 1.5.3
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மா யோனிகளாய் நடை கற்ற வானோர் பலரும் முனிவரும்  
நீ யோனிகளைப் படை என்று நிறை நான்முகனைப் படைத்தவன்  
சேயோன் எல்லா அறிவுக்கும்; திசைகள் எல்லாம் திருவடியால்  
தாயோன் எல்லா எவ் உயிர்க்கும் தாயோன் தான் ஓர் உருவனே.

mā yōṉikaḷāy naṭai kaṟṟa vāṉōr palarum muṉivarum  
nī yōṉikaḷaip paṭai eṉṟu niṟai nāṉmukaṉaip paṭaittavaṉ  
cēyōṉ ellā aṟivukkum; ticaikaḷ ellām tiruvaṭiyāl  
tāyōṉ ellā ev uyirkkum tāyōṉ tāṉ ōr uruvaṉē.

**English translation of verse 1.5.3:**

He who created the profound Nāṉmukaṉ (Brahmā) and bade him create  
The exalted Vānōr (Devas), Sages and several others.  
He who is beyond comprehension, whose lovely feet  
Spanned the worlds, who unto all is like a Mother,  
Is our unique Lord (as condescending as He is great).

**Note**

Finding the Āḻvār in a state of unparalleled humility, shrinking back, the Lord draws his attention to the other mellowing aspect, namely, His loving condescension. Did He not span the entire universe with utter impartiality and set His tender feet over hill and dale, and one and all, without distinction of high and low? Contemplating this episode, the Āḻvār got into a mid-condition in which he would neither approach the Lord nor get away from Him but keep talking of the unique combination in the Lord, of exaltation and condescension, which cannot be found in any one else.




## 1.5.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

தான் ஓர் உருவே தனிவித்தாய் தன்னின் மூவர் முதலாய  
வானோர் பலரும் முனிவரும் மற்றும் மற்றும் முற்றும் ஆய்  
தான் ஓர் பெருநீர் தன்னுள்ளே தோற்றி அதனுள் கண்வளரும்  
வானோர் பெருமான் மா மாயன் வைகுந்தன் எம் பெருமானே.

tāṉ ōr uruvē taṉivittāy taṉṉiṉ mūvar mutalāya  
vāṉōr palarum muṉivarum maṟṟum maṟṟum muṟṟum āy  
tāṉ ōr perunīr taṉṉuḷḷē tōṟṟi ataṉuḷ kaṇvaḷarum  
vāṉōr perumāṉ mā māyaṉ vaikuntaṉ em perumāṉē.

**Preamble**

Finding the Āḻvār, a little less scared of the Lord’s exaltation than a little while ago, some persons asked him what exactly he was intending to do, whether to get near the Lord or get away from Him. This stanza provides the answer to this question, real or supposed.

The Āḻvār says:

> “Even if I wish to keep aloof, my Lord would not give me up. Look at
> His condescending love of amazing dimensions. The great Creator of all
> the worlds and all classes of sentient and non-sentient beings, the
> Supreme Master of all, including the celestials in the High Heaven,
> above wants of any kind, reclining on the bosom of the vast expanse of
> water in Yoga nidrā, is now tight here to claim me as His inalienable
> property”.

**English translation of verse 1.5.4:**

The Supreme Lord beside whom there was none.  
Created the first three (Brahmā, Śiva and Indra), this, that and the other,  
(Devas, Sages, men, birds, beasts and all) with no *external aid* (i) whatever  
And reposed (in Yoga nidra) on the vast expanse of water,  
He had raised; the wondrous Lord, Chief of celestials, Vaikuntaṉ, is also my *Master* (ii).

**Notes**

\(i\) The Lord is at once the *Material* (Upādāna) cause, *Operative* (nimitta) cause and *Instrumental or efficient* (Sahakāri) cause of Creation.

\(ii\) This is the key word for this stanza. The Master has come to reclaim His property (the Āḻvār) and He shall not be a party to its slipping through the fingers.




## 1.5.5
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மானேய் நோக்கி மடவாளை மார்பில் கொண்டாய்! மாதவா!  
கூனே சிதைய உண்டை வில் நிறத்தில் தெறித்தாய்! கோவிந்தா!  
வான் ஆர் சோதி மணிவண்ணா! மதுசூதா! நீ அருளாய் உன்-  
தேனே மலரும் திருப்பாதம் சேருமாறு வினையேனே.

māṉēy nōkki maṭavāḷai mārpil koṇṭāy! mātavā!

vāṉ ār cōti maṇivaṇṇā! matucūtā! nī aruḷāy uṉ-  
tēṉē malarum tiruppātam cērumāṟu viṉaiyēṉē.

**Preamble**

There are two Ways of looking at the background of this stanza. The first is: With the recession of his self-abnegating humility, the Āḻvār prays for the felicity of constant attendance on the Lord, in close proximity. The other is: Intent upon stabilising the Āḻvār’s longing for Him so that there is no slipping back again, the Lord intensifies the longing by keeping away from him for a while. Unable to stand this separation, the Āḻvār cries out his heart, invoking the Lord’s grace for reunion.

**English translation of verse 1.5.5:**

On your winsome chest, you hold doe-eyed Mother, Oh, Mātavā,  
With perfect ease, you remove *the hunch* (i) off a damsel, oh, Kōvintā,  
Your sapphire hue radiates the entire heaven, oh, *Matucūtā* (ii)  
Your *grace* (iii), this sinner invokes to reach your lotus feet, shedding honey.

**Notes**

\(i\) The underlying episode could be either the one stated here, pertaining to Kṛṣṇāvatāra or yet another pertaining to Rāmāvatāra. The former is: As Kṛṣṇa was wending His way through the main road of Mathura along with Balarāma, Tṛvakrā, the hump-backed young woman with handsome features, was passing along with a vessel containing sweet-smelling sandal paste, specially prepared by her for King Kaṃsa. Kṛṣṇa accosted her and demanded of her some of that excellent preparation. Entranced by Their bewitching looks, she gave the Divine Brothers the thick aromatic paste, with all her heart. Greatly pleased with the service, Śrī Kṛṣṇa deftly transformed her at once into a straight-backed damsel, erect and elegant.

The episode in Rāmāyaṇa relates to Śrī Rāma having hit, out of a boyish prank, the hump on the back of the hunch-backed Mantarā, the maid-servant of Queen Kaikeyī, with unerring aim and caused her great pain. She then bore her suffering silently but wreaked her vengeance on Rāma, at the crucial moment, by poisoning the mind of Kaikeyī. But then, this mischief is attributed to Govinda, that is, Kṛṣṇa in this stanza, which is apparently a misfit. There is, however, the following explanation for this in Nampiḷḷai’s ‘Īṭu’: ‘Govinda’ could also mean, ‘Protector of the Earth’, in which case, the address could fit in with Rāma, as well. Alternately, Kṛṣṇa, with so many mischievous pranks up His sleeves, could easily be made the butt for each and every frolic, whether perpetrated by Him or not, even as the saying goes, “All sins shall be heaped on Amana’s head”. And now, who is this poor Amaṇa, earning such vicarious notriety? Amaṇa or Śamaṇā is an ascetic of the jain religious order. A complaint went to the King who was a simpleton. The complaint arose from the mud wall of a Brahmin’s house giving way and killing a thief who broke into it. When the thief’s friends demanded of the Brahmin compensation, both parties appealed to the King for justice. The King asked the Brahmin to pay compensation, as the thief died because of the wet wall. The Brahmin, however, put the blame on the mason who built the Wall. The mason appeared in court and pleaded that it was all the mistake of the waterman who had poured too much water. The waterman blamed the potter who had made the pot big. The potter excused himself by putting the blame on a dancing girl, who passed along and diverted his attention while making the pot. The dancing girl, in turn, blamed the washerman, who failed to bring her clothes in time, and necessitated her visit to his house. The dhoby too trotted out an excuse that the stone on which he washed the clothes was occupied by a Śamaṇa who wouldn’t budge from it for quite a long time, and so the return of clothes to the customers was got delayed. And now, the Śamaṇa kept quiet, on account of his vow of silence and the stupid King construed this silence as admission of guilt and ordered the Śamaṇa to be hanged. Our pity rather goes to Kṛṣṇa at whose door every fault is laid, in this fashion.

\(ii\) ‘Matucūta’, the Sanskrit word being ‘Madhusūda’ means: Slayer of the demon called Madhu.

\(iii\) The grace which could condone the sin of the Āḻvār, attempting to run away from the Lord like unto the ruthless rejection of the food served at the dining table.




## 1.5.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வினையேன் வினை தீர் மருந்து ஆனாய்! விண்ணோர் தலைவா! கேசவா!

**English translation of verse 1.5.6:**

Oh, Kēcava, reigning supreme in the high Heavens  
Thou art the antidote for this sinner’s (dire) sins.  
Oh, Mātavā, of mysterious deeds! Chief of cowherds,  
The seven trees with branches many! oh, Cirītarā, Thine arrow pierced.  
Dissolve do I, recounting such other deeds of yours  
And the relative names You are pleased to bear.

**Note**

This is a song sung in the same mood as the immediately preceding song.




## 1.5.7
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அடியேன் சிறிய ஞானத்தன்; அறிதல் ஆர்க்கும் அரியானை  
கடி சேர் தண் அம் துழாய்க் கண்ணி புனைந்தான் தன்னை கண்ணனை  
செடி ஆர் ஆக்கை அடியாரைச் சேர்தல் தீர்க்கும் திருமாலை  
அடியேன் காண்பான் அலற்றுவன்; இதனின் மிக்கு ஓர் அயர்வு உண்டே?

aṭiyēṉ ciṟiya ñāṉattaṉ; aṟital ārkkum ariyāṉai

aṭiyēṉ kāṇpāṉ alaṟṟuvaṉ; itaṉiṉ mikku ōr ayarvu uṇṭē?

**English translation of verse 1.5.7:**

This humble self of meagre intellect pines to meet  
Kaṇṇaṉ, sporting tulacī garland, cool and lovely, of fragrance sweet.  
Beyond the Comprehension of one and all (however great),  
‘Tirumāl’, who, unto those that seek Him, does cut out  
Their bondage dense; is there anything more indiscreet?

**Note**

The preceding song ended on a despondent note, showing the Āḻvār sinking down, due to the poignance of separation from the Lord. The merciful Lord would not run the risk of testing him anymore, and was about to oblige him with His presence. Sensing this, however, the Āḻvār was once more weighed down by inferiority complex, egging him on to retreat again. The Āḻvār has all along vociferously condemned those who are content with mere self-enjoyment (Kaivalya) after perennial disembodiment, that is, liberation from the cycle of birth and death, which is far inferior to the bliss of constant service unto the Lord in Heaven. In the present context, however, the Āḻvār is inclined to hold that even this would be wholesome, as compared to a state of embodiment such as his, with its potentiality for such blasphemous conduct as pining for the Lord’s presence and mixing with Him, thereby defiling His sacred person. This is indeed the limit for the Āḻvār’s humility (naicya).




## 1.5.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

உண்டாய் உலகு ஏழ் முன்னமே; உமிழ்ந்து மாயையால் புக்கு  
உண்டாய் வெண்ணெய் சிறு மனிசர் உவலை ஆக்கை நிலை எய்தி  
மண் தான் சோர்ந்தது உண்டேலும் மனிசர்க்கு ஆகும் பீர் சிறிதும்-  
அண்டாவண்ணம் மண் கரைய நெய் ஊண் மருந்தோ? மாயோனே!

uṇṭāy veṇṇey ciṟu maṉicar uvalai ākkai nilai eyti  
maṇ tāṉ cōrntatu uṇṭēlum maṉicarkku ākum pīr ciṟitum-  
aṇṭāvaṇṇam maṇ karaiya ney ūṇ maruntō? māyōṉē!

**English translation of verse 1.5.8:**

Wondrous Lord, Once you ate up all the worlds seven  
And then spat them out, You then came at your volition  
Into this world, assuming the frail form of a human  
And ate all the butter (in Gokul) leaving no remnant;  
Could it be that you thus sought to dissolve the remnants  
Of mud still sticking inside and keep off indigestion.  
The fell sickness that befalls humans? (I think it wasn’t that).

**Note**

We are indeed under a deep debt of gratitude to those intellectual stalwarts, our great *Pūrvācāryas*, which we can hardly repay. Look at how they have delved in and unfolded the genesis of this song, from the way it has been worded. The Lord was bent upon having a rapport with the Āḻvār and hit upon a plan which would work well and bring round the Āḻvār, shaking off his inferiority complex. There ensued a dialogue wherein the Lord wanted to elicit from the Āḻvār the purpose of His having come down to Gokul, as a cowherd and gobbled up all the available butter. When the Āḻvār pleaded ignorance, the Lord Himself gave out that it was just an antidote against the ill-effects of the mud, if any, still sticking inside His stomach, which had once kept all the seven worlds within and thrown them out after some time. The Āḻvār could hardly swallow such a fantastic explanation, firstly, because of the heavy time-lag between the two events and secondly, because there was no reason why He should have appropriated to Himself all the butter produced in that pastoral village, if it was to be a mere medicine. The Āḻvār opined that the Lord ate up avidly all that butter because it was produced by the loving hands of His devotees, a produce which He coveted very much and would not mind taking even stealthily, when not given for the asking. Precisely here, the Āḻvār fell into the Lord’s trap. The Lord was quick to point out that the Āḻvār was dear to Him for the same reason and, by trying to keep aloof from Him, he would only join the rank and file of those who tried to keep the butter from Him.




## 1.5.9
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மாயோம் தீய அலவலைப் பெரு மா வஞ்சப் பேய் வீயத்  
தூய குழவியாய் விடப் பால் அமுதா அமுது செய்திட்ட-  
மாயன் வானோர் தனித் தலைவன் மலராள் மைந்தன் எவ் உயிர்க்கும்-  
தாயோன் தம்மான் என் அம்மான் அம்மா மூர்த்தியைச் சார்ந்தே.

tāyōṉ tammāṉ eṉ ammāṉ ammā mūrttiyaic cārntē.

**English translation of verse 1.5.9:**

The unique Lord of celestials, *Malarāḷ’s* (the lotus-born Lakṣmī’s) Consort,  
A veritable Mother (unto all) who His own Sovereign is,  
As well as mine, the typical (but wondrous) babe that killed outright  
The highly treacherous and loquacious demoness  
Whose poisonous milk He sucked as if it were nectar (amṛt [amṛta])  
Close unto the exalted one am I; may we never again be apart.

**Note**

Here is the continuation of the dialogue referred to in the preceding stanza. The Āḻvār observed that unlike the palatable butter, mixing with him, a terrible sinner, will be bitter like poison. But the Lord had a ready reply for this also. He pointed out that even the milk of the poisonous breast of Pūtaṉā, the evil-minded imposter of a mother, was sucked by Him, with great relish, as if it were nectar. So saying. He pounced upon the Āḻvār and got hold of him. The Āḻvār also responded by avowing that he will never again part from Him. The line in this song narrating that the Lord, typical of a tender babe, relished the poisonous milk tendered by Pūtaṉā like nectar, follows the text of ‘Harivaṃśa [Harivaṃśam]’.[^1]


[^1]:  ‘sthanyaṃ tat viṣa sammiśraṃ rasyamāsīth jagad guro’.




## 1.5.10
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

சார்ந்த இரு வல் வினைகளும் சரித்து மாயப் பற்று அறுத்து  
தீர்ந்து தன்பால் மனம் வைக்கத் திருத்தி வீடு திருத்துவான்  
ஆர்ந்த ஞானச் சுடர் ஆகி அகலம் கீழ் மேல் அளவு இறந்து

**English translation of verse 1.5.10:**

Of resplendent knowledge, full and flooding,  
All things, with or without form, He is pervading  
Up and down and all around; Neṭumāl (of love supreme)  
Rid me of my age-long sins of commission and omission and in Him  
Rooted my mind firmly, freed from ignorance and attachments  
And is now intent upon giving heaven a face-lift(to put me in).

**Note**

Immensely pleased with the assurance given by the Āḻvār in the previous song not to get parted from Him any more, the Lord now contemplates putting the Āḻvār in Heaven, so as to eliminate the possible risk of further separation from Him. And for this purpose, the Lord, in His unbounded love for the Āḻvār, wants to renovate even that Eternal Land, ever fresh and pure, which hardly needs touching up or a facelift, as such! Indeed, The Āḻvār feels enthralled by the Lord’s extraordinary love for him (as the word ‘Neṭumāl’ in the text connotes).




## 1.5.11

**English translation of verse 1.5.11:**

Those conversant with these songs ten,  
Out of the thousand sung by Kurukūr Caṭakōpaṉ,  
Firm recipient of the Lord’s grace, in ecstatic adoration  
Of His wondrous deeds and glorious traits, evoking the admiration  
Alike of the ‘Sweet-as-milk’ Tamil-Scholars, devotees and musicians,  
Shall for ever be free from affliction.

**Notes**

\(i\) The accent here is on the redemptive grace of the Lord, Who, by His condescending love, reclaimed the Āḻvār, thwarting his attempt to run away from Him in a frightfully unsettled state of mind.

\(ii\) These songs are of matchless grandeur and inestimable value for those who want to revel in singing sweet songs of a high order. And again, for those who want to delve into their meanings and eke out their time usefully, these songs afford unlimited scope.
