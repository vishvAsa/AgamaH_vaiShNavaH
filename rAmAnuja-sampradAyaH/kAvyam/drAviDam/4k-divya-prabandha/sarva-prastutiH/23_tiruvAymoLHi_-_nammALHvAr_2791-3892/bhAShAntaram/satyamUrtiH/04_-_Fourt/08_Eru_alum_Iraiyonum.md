## 00 Intro4.8
The Āḻvār’s passionate appeal to the Lord, in the last decad, did not yield the desired result. The Lord didn’t present Himself before the ardent devotee, and the latter, therefore, concluded that he was not in His good books. And, in this context, the Alvar felt that neither he nor his possessions deserved to exist. The very valuable Śāstraic meaning that anything, which hinders Divine Service and does not actively aid and participate in such service, deserves to be eschewed, is imparted in this decad. The Āḻvār is now in the same predicament as that of Sītā during her captivity in Laṅkā. Sītā then exclaimed that her very existence was meaningless, staying so far away from her Lord and not rescued by Him as yet. The sentiments expressed by the Āḻvār in this decad, are fully echoed by Saint Yāmuna, in Śloka 57 of his ‘Stotra Ratna’. The saint swears that he would not tolerate for a moment anything which was outside the domain of His service, be it his body, his very life, the happiness desired by all beings, the Soul and other social relations like wife, children, friends etc., and that he would want all these to get destroyed in a hundred ways, if they proved a hindrance to Divine Service.

Even in this decad, the Āḻvār continues in the feminine state, as is evident from the text of the songs referring to the Nāyakī's bangles, garments, complexion etc. Śrī Āṇṭāḷ is found even more emphatic when she says in ‘Nācciyār Tirumoḻi’ that, if her beloved Lord would not come and embrace her, she would rather pluck out her breasts from their base, and throw them at Him. The breasts, as already explained earlier, signify the emotional upsurge, divine love, too deep for words.




## 4.8.1
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஏறு ஆளும் இறையோனும் திசைமுகனும் திருமகளும்,  
கூறு ஆளும் தனி உடம்பன் குலம் குலமா அசுரர்களை,  
நீறு ஆகும்படியாக நிருமித்து படை தொட்ட,  
மாறாளன் கவராத மணி மாமை குறைவு இலமே. (2)

ēṟu āḷum iṟaiyōṉum ticaimukaṉum tirumakaḷum,  
kūṟu āḷum taṉi uṭampaṉ kulam kulamā acurarkaḷai,  
nīṟu ākumpaṭiyāka nirumittu paṭai toṭṭa,  
māṟāḷaṉ kavarāta maṇi māmai kuṟaivu ilamē. (2)

**English translation of verse 4.8.1:**

Of what use is my complexion lovely  
If it attracts not my valorous Lord,  
Who resolved to rout the Asura hordes  
And destroyed them with weapons deadly,  
On whose unique person, vast and expansive, dwell  
Ticaimukaṉ (Brahmā), Iṟaiyōṉ, whose mount is the bull  
And Tirumakaḷ (Lakṣmī) (well apart)?

**Note**

The Āḻvār highlights the Lord’s ‘*Sauśilya*’ or condescending love, allotting portions of His body, well demarcated, for the occupation of Iṟaiyōṉ (Śiva), Brahmā and Lakṣmī. And then, the Lord’s valour is talked about. By a mere resolve, He could create the entire universe and likewise, He could as well destroy all the evil forces. And yet, He incarnated, now and then, and engaged the ungodly in a personal combat and destroyed them with His mighty weapons, simply because of His intolerance of their affront to His devotees. The enemies of His devotees are regarded by Him as His opponents and He will never forgive them. If the Lord, so loving and valorous, did not come and delightfully pounce upon Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī, of what use is her lovely complexion? She too, finds no charm in a complexion which ceases to attract the Lord.




## 4.8.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மணி மாமை குறைவு இல்லா மலர்மாதர் உறை மார்பன்,  
அணி மானத் தட வரைத்தோள் அடல் ஆழித் தடக்கையன்,  
பணி மானம் பிழையாமே அடியேனைப் பணிகொண்ட,  
மணிமாயன் கவராத மட நெஞ்சால் குறைவு இலமே.

maṇi māmai kuṟaivu illā malarmātar uṟai mārpaṉ,  
aṇi māṉat taṭa varaittōḷ aṭal āḻit taṭakkaiyaṉ,  
paṇi māṉam piḻaiyāmē aṭiyēṉaip paṇikoṇṭa,  
maṇimāyaṉ kavarāta maṭa neñcāl kuṟaivu ilamē.

**English translation of verse 4.8.2:**

Even my docile mind 1 shall discard outright,  
If it attracts not my Lord of sapphire hue,  
Who did in His service enlist this vassal all right,  
Who holds the discus bright in His hand huge,  
Of shoulders, stout and strong, on whose chest  
Resides the lotus-born (Lakṣmī), of hue exquisite.

**Notes**

\(i\) It was the charming conjunction of the Lord and Lakṣmī of exquisite complexion that attracted the Āḻvār and enlisted him as their vassal. And yet, if the Lord is not attracted by his docile mind, of what use is it to him either? Nañcīyar would elucidate this, as follows: There was a time when the Nāyakī’s mind was unto her lover as delectable as high-class sandal paste vide IV-3-1. The Nāyakī’s discarding her mind in the present state is comparable to the frustrated female lover breaking the cosmetic bottle, light in front of her beloved to express her resentment over the latter’s delayed appearance.

\(ii\) Lakṣmī’s complexion is exquisite and of undiminishing charm as she dwells on His winsome chest inseparably, unlike the Āḻvār’s complexion, which suffers for want of such patronage.

\(iii\) The Āḻvār’s service, referred to, in this song, is the ‘*Vācika Kaiṅkarya*’, that is singing the Lord’s glory in these hymns. The Lord is said to have enlisted the Āḻvār, in His service, *in a punctilious manner*. Here is an instructive anecdote. In the holy monastery of Sri Rāmānuja, the Śrī Vaiṣṇavas used to be fed daily and they were served by Kiṭāmpi-Āccāṉ, a disciple of Śrī Rāmānuja. One of those days, Śrī Rāmānuja noticed Āccāṉ serving drinking water to the guests, standing sideways, a sort of indifference or lack of respect for the guests, Śrī Rāmānuja ran up to him and striking him on the back, burst out: “You dud! don’t you know that you have to serve the guests reverently, by standing in front and facing them?” Without feeling hurt, in the least, Āccāṉ gratefully acknowledged the Master’s correction, administered out of his abundant affection for the disciple and bowed unto him, reciting the appropriate line from this song as in the original text.




## 4.8.3
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மட நெஞ்சால் குறைவு இல்லா மகள்தாய்செய்து ஒரு பேய்ச்சி,  
விட நஞ்ச முலை சுவைத்த மிகு ஞானச் சிறு குழவி,  
பட நாகத்து அணைக் கிடந்த பரு வரைத் தோள் பரம்புருடன்,  
நெடுமாயன் கவராத நிறையினால் குறைவு இலமே.

maṭa neñcāl kuṟaivu illā makaḷtāyceytu oru pēycci,  
viṭa nañca mulai cuvaitta miku ñāṉac ciṟu kuḻavi,  
paṭa nākattu aṇaik kiṭanta paru varait tōḷ parampuruṭaṉ,  
neṭumāyaṉ kavarāta niṟaiyiṉāl kuṟaivu ilamē.

**English translation of verse 4.8.3:**

My sense of modesty I shall abjure if it attracts not  
The Lord Supreme, of wondrous deeds unlimited,  
Of shoulders, huge and hefty, resting on hooded serpent-bed,  
Who, as the little babe with Knowledge great, sucked the life out,  
Of the demoness that played the mother perfect  
And suckled Him with deadly poison on her breast.

**Notes**

\(i\) In the preceding song, the Nāyakī disowned her mind, on the ground that it failed to attract the Lord and become the object of His affection. And now, she is prepared to abjure her sense of modesty, which had kept her under restraint so long, thinking that the Lord would come to her of His own accord. What is the good of her modesty, after she has been discarded by the Lord who had once lavished on her all His affections?

\(ii\) *The little Babe with knowledge great*

Pūtanā, the demoness played the perfect mother and Kṛṣṇa, the Omniscient Babe also played the perfect babe, and sucked her breasts, coated with deadly poison, without the reservation usually shown to strangers and, in the bargain, sucked her life out. Thence forward, even Yaśodhā was awakened to the realisation that it was not a mere babe and began to look upon it with great awe. That is why Śrī Kṛṣṇa is referred to, in this song, as the Omniscient Babe, ‘*the little babe with great knowledge*’, even as the Lord’s devotees have been referred to elsewhere as the ‘little big men’, that is, men of great prowess moving about, in frail physical frames.

\(iii\) *The Lord Supreme (Parampuruṭaṉ*): It is only when He reclines on Ādiśeṣa, the Lord looks the Supreme Sovereign that He is, like unto the gem, well set on the foil.




## 4.8.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நிறையினால் குறைவு இல்லா நெடும் பணைத் தோள் மடப் பின்னை,  
பொறையினால் முலை அணைவான் பொரு விடை ஏழ் அடர்த்து உகந்த,  
கறையினார் துவர் உடுக்கை கடை ஆவின் கழி கோல் கைச்,  
சறையினார் கவராத தளிர் நிறத்தால் குறைவு இலமே

niṟaiyiṉāl kuṟaivu illā neṭum paṇait tōḷ maṭap piṉṉai,  
poṟaiyiṉāl mulai aṇaivāṉ poru viṭai ēḻ aṭarttu ukanta,  
kaṟaiyiṉār tuvar uṭukkai kaṭai āviṉ kaḻi kōl kaic,  
caṟaiyiṉār kavarāta taḷir niṟattāl kuṟaivu ilamē

**English translation of verse 4.8.4:**

This tender leaf-like complexion of mine  
Is by me hardly liked when it holds no attraction  
For (Kṛṣṇa), my Lord, Who His body tends not, whose cloth leathern.  
Bears many a stain, Who, with bamboo pipe and lovely whip,  
Moves about, Who tamed the unruly bulls seven, to grip  
And embrace piṇṇai with shoulders long and feminine perfection.

**Note**

The pastoral life led by the Lord, as Kṛṣṇa, the young cow-herd is vividly described in this song, in all its details. The shepherds wear cloth made of leather, when they move about in the forests tending the cows and calves, as a safeguard against brambles and bushes. The wild fruits they gather in plenty, tie them up in clothes and eat, thereby staining the clothes. They always carry with them the whip to control the cattle and the vessel made of bamboo pipe to hold milk, as and when the cows are milked. They seldom bathed, and even on the few occasions they had some sort of a bath, it was only partial. Even this semblance of a bath, Kṛṣṇa didn’t have, as he had hardly the time for it, tending, as he was, the cattle all the time. This only exemplifies His sole concern for His subjects. The word, ‘Caṟaiyiṉār’, in the text of this song, could mean either the one, not tending his body or the bell the shepherds tie round the waist the tingling sound whereof would guide the movement of the cattle following them.




## 4.8.5
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

தளிர் நிறத்தால் குறைவு இல்லாத் தனிச் சிறையில் விளப்பு உற்ற,  
கிளிமொழியாள் காரணமாக் கிளர் அரக்கன் நகர் எரித்த,  
களி மலர்த் துழாய் அலங்கல் கமழ் முடியன் கடல் ஞாலத்து,  
அளிமிக்கான் கவராத, அறிவினால் குறைவு இலமே.

taḷir niṟattāl kuṟaivu illāt taṉic ciṟaiyil viḷappu uṟṟa,  
kiḷimoḻiyāḷ kāraṇamāk kiḷar arakkaṉ nakar eritta,  
kaḷi malart tuḻāy alaṅkal kamaḻ muṭiyaṉ kaṭal ñālattu,  
aḷimikkāṉ kavarāta, aṟiviṉāl kuṟaivu ilamē.

**English translation of verse 4.8.5:**

Knowledge is of no avail unto me as well  
If it attracts not (aids not service unto) the Lord,  
Full of love, sporting on His crown tulaci garland of fragrance full,  
Shedding honey in plenty, Who the city destroyed  
Of (Rāvaṇa), the demon haughty, and rescued  
The sweet-tongued (Sītā) of peerless grace  
And exquisite complexion from her captivity unique.

**Notes:**

\(i\) *Captivity unique*: Rāmāyaṇa is said to describe the greatness of Sītā, the captive. The greatness of Sītā’s captivity in Laṅkā lies in the spontaniety with which she courted imprisonment in Laṅkā and underwent unspeakable sufferings, in order to secure the release of the numerous celestial beauties, kept in bondage by the formidable Rāvaṇa—an act of grace galore! The superficial reader who sees not the element of grace but only a Sītā, forcibly abducted by the love-smitten Rāvaṇa, completely misses the mark.

\(ii\) *Sweet-tongued Sītā*: On return from his pioneering visit to Laṅkā, Hanuman narrated to Śrī Rāma, the dialogue between him and Sītā. This sent Śrī Rāma musing over the sweet speech of Sītā and he exclaimed: ‘Madhurā Madhurālāpā.’

\(iii\) True knowledge is that which keeps one’s mind wetted to the Supreme Lord. The so-called knowledge of mundane affairs, divorced from divine consciousness, however perfect in its own right, is hardly worth its while; it is not knowledge in the real sense.




## 4.8.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அறிவினால் குறைவு இல்லா அகல் ஞாலத்தவர் அறிய,  
நெறி எல்லாம் எடுத்து உரைத்த நிறை ஞானத்து ஒருமூர்த்தி,  
குறிய மாண் உரு ஆகி கொடுங் கோளால் நிலம் கொண்ட,  
கிறி அம்மான் கவராத கிளர் ஒளியால் குறைவு இலமே.

aṟiviṉāl kuṟaivu illā akal ñālattavar aṟiya,  
neṟi ellām eṭuttu uraitta niṟai ñāṉattu orumūrtti,  
kuṟiya māṇ uru āki koṭuṅ kōḷāl nilam koṇṭa,  
kiṟi ammāṉ kavarāta kiḷar oḷiyāl kuṟaivu ilamē.

**English translation of verse 4.8.6:**

My charming beauty is unto me of no avail  
When it holds no charm unto the Lord unique, of Knowledge full,  
Who did, unto the people of this wide world, knowledge impart,  
The ways and means of attaining Him and all that,  
Who, as the midget resourceful, got land (from Bali), on the sly.

**Note**

The Lord Himself has clearly set out, in Bhagavad Gītā, the ways and means of attaining Him. Those who are not amenable to advice, He would entice by His alluring Charm and His exquisite Form, enthralling every one, as in the case of Mahā Bali. “Of what use is my comeliness if my Lord, so generous, is not attracted by it? the Āḻvār questions himself.




## 4.8.7
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கிளர் ஒளியால் குறைவு இல்லா அரி உருவாய்க் கிளர்ந்து எழுந்து,  
கிளர் ஒளிய இரணியனது அகல் மார்பம் கிழித்து உகந்த,  
வளர் ஒளிய கனல் ஆழி வலம்புரியன் மணி நீல,  
வளர் ஒளியான் கவராத வரி வளையால் குறைவு இலமே.

kiḷar oḷiyāl kuṟaivu illā ari uruvāyk kiḷarntu eḻuntu,  
kiḷar oḷiya iraṇiyaṉatu akal mārpam kiḻittu ukanta,  
vaḷar oḷiya kaṉal āḻi valampuriyaṉ maṇi nīla,  
vaḷar oḷiyāṉ kavarāta vari vaḷaiyāl kuṟaivu ilamē.

**English translation of verse 4.8.7:**

I wouldn’t need the bangles nice, disliked by the Lord,  
Lustrous like the blue gem, who the discus flamboyant holds,  
Who, as ‘Ari’ the Man-Lion of mounting radiance, emerged with rage  
And gladly split the broad chest of Iraṇiyaṉ, of prowess great.

**Notes**

\(i\) The Lord, who emerged as Narasiṃha, the effulgent Man-Lion, split into two, the powerful Hiraṇyā’s broad chest and rejoiced that He had destroyed the enemy of Prahlāda, His great devotee. The only weapons, He then used, were His sharp nails. The boons which had fortified the demon, virtually served as the feed for his gigantic strength of formidable proportions and yet it could hardly appease half the hunger of Narasiṃha’s nails. The ferocious Man-Lion’s formidable appearance with open mouth, tongue protruding over the lip, clenched fist, ready for the knock and tumultuous ejaculations, reduced Hiraṇya to the sad plight of a roasted pig and the Lord tore him off effortlessly. The discus and the other weapons of the Lord should have obviously been flaming with rage that they could not be commissioned to share the spoils in the peculiar context of slaying the demon, armed with special boons of a bewildering variety.

\(ii\) The Nāyakī laments that she hardly needs to be bedecked, when He, who came to the aid of Prahlāda, the young lad whose very father had turned terribly hostile to him, would not succour her, who also pines for His patronage. (Iṭu)




## 4.8.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வரி வளையால் குறைவு இல்லாப் பெரு முழக்கால் அடங்காரை,  
எரி அழலம் புக ஊதி இரு நிலம் முன் துயர் தவிர்த்த,  
தெரிவு அரிய சிவன் பிரமன் அமரர் கோன் பணிந்து ஏத்தும்,  
விரி புகழான் கவராத மேகலையால் குறைவு இலமே.

vari vaḷaiyāl kuṟaivu illāp peru muḻakkāl aṭaṅkārai,  
eri aḻalam puka ūti iru nilam muṉ tuyar tavirtta,  
terivu ariya civaṉ piramaṉ amarar kōṉ paṇintu ēttum,  
viri pukaḻāṉ kavarāta mēkalaiyāl kuṟaivu ilamē.

**English translation of verse 4.8.8:**

I needn’t the garments which attract not  
My Lord of fame far-flung, who rid the Earth vast  
Of its burden heavy and did in the enemies kindle  
The fire of mounting fright when He blew the conch spiral,  
Adored by Civaṉ, Piramaṉ, Amararkōṉ and other Celestials.

**Note**

When Lord Kṛṣṇa blew ‘Pāñcajanya His conch, on the battlefield, it instantly unnerved all His enemies. On the other hand, it warmed up the ardent devotees. Rukmiṇi was in such a forlorn state, after her betrothal to Śiśupāla, that she was on the very verge of collapse and it was the heartening sound from Śrī Kṛṣṇa’s conch, from an ambush nearby, that revived her. When the severed head of an illusory Rāma was exhibited before Sītā, in Aśoka Vana, it was the sound from Śrī Rāma’s bow-string on the battlefield that disillusioned her and put her at ease. Parāśara Bhaṭṭar would say that Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī naturally pined for similar relief as she was also one like Sītā and Rukmiṇi.




## 4.8.9
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மேகலையால் குறைவு இல்லா மெலிவு உற்ற அகல் அல்குல்,  
போகமகள் புகழ்த் தந்தை விறல் வாணன் புயம் துணித்து,  
நாகமிசைத் துயில்வான்போல் உலகு எல்லாம் நன்கு ஒடுங்க,  
யோகு அணைவான் கவராத உடம்பினால் குறைவு இலமே.

mēkalaiyāl kuṟaivu illā melivu uṟṟa akal alkul,  
pōkamakaḷ pukaḻt tantai viṟal vāṇaṉ puyam tuṇittu,  
nākamicait tuyilvāṉpōl ulaku ellām naṉku oṭuṅka,  
yōku aṇaivāṉ kavarāta uṭampiṉāl kuṟaivu ilamē.

**English translation of verse 4.8.9:**

We have no need for this body disliked by the Lord,  
Who seems asleep on the bosom of (Ādiśeṣa) the serpent  
But thinks out ways and means of the worlds’ betterment,  
Who the sturdy shoulders severed of Vāṇaṉ, the redoubted  
Father of (Uṣā) the young lady of supple grace  
And ravishing beauty, with plenty of garments nice.

**Note**

If Bāṇāsura’s life was spared by the Lord, it was only out of consideration for Uṣā, that she shall not be orphaned. The Nāyakī naturally feels that the Lord does not extend a similar care in her case and if her body holds out no charm for Him, it hardly deserves to be relished by her.




## 4.8.10
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

உடம்பினால் குறைவு இல்லா உயிர் பிரிந்த மலைத்துண்டம்,  
கிடந்தனபோல் துணி பலவா அசுரர் குழாம் துணித்து உகந்த,  
தடம் புனல சடைமுடியன் தனி ஒருகூறு அமர்ந்து உறையும்,  
உடம்பு உடையான் கவராத உயிரினால் குறைவு இலமே.

uṭampiṉāl kuṟaivu illā uyir pirinta malaittuṇṭam,  
kiṭantaṉapōl tuṇi palavā acurar kuḻām tuṇittu ukanta,  
taṭam puṉala caṭaimuṭiyaṉ taṉi orukūṟu amarntu uṟaiyum,  
uṭampu uṭaiyāṉ kavarāta uyiriṉāl kuṟaivu ilamē.

**English translation of verse 4.8.10:**

My Soul I can hardly love if it repels the Lord.  
Who into bits many did split the hefty Asura hordes  
And complacent fed, on whose body huge does reside  
Śiva, bearing the cool waters (of Gaṅgā) on matted locks.

**Note**

The essential nature of the Soul is to subserve the Lord but if He doesn’t like to take service from it, it just doesn’t deserve to exist. The immortality of the Soul is not to be brought in here and the point at issue confused. What is emphasised here is that things which are not linked up with God, are as good as non-existent. The Nāyakī is indeed vexed that the Lord who has allotted a portion of His body even to Śiva whose ego often times gets bloated and makes him fed that he is the Supreme, does not oblige her likewise. It is a pity that the Lord who destroyed all the evil forces out of loving condescension for the welfare of His devotees, should be indifferent to the Nāyakī, who is as good as non-existent (asat), when not sustained by His loving attention.




## 4.8.11
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

உயிரினால் குறைவு இல்லா உலகு ஏழ் தன்னுள் ஒடுக்கி,  
தயிர் வெண்ணெய் உண்டானைத், தடம் குருகூர்ச் சடகோபன்,  
செயிர் இல் சொல் இசைமாலை ஆயிரத்துள் இப்பத்தால்  
வயிரம்சேர் பிறப்பு அறுத்து வைகுந்தம் நண்ணுவரே. (2)

uyiriṉāl kuṟaivu illā ulaku ēḻ taṉṉuḷ oṭukki,

ceyir il col icaimālai āyirattuḷ ippattāl  
vayiramcēr piṟappu aṟuttu vaikuntam naṇṇuvarē. (2)

**English translation of verse 4.8.11:**

Those that chant these songs ten  
Out of the thousand, flawless and mellifluous, of Caṭakōpaṉ,  
Adoring the Lord, Who did in Him compress and sustain  
The souls innumerable and their worlds seven  
And then ate up the curds and butter (as child Divine),  
Will have their chronic cycle of birth and death ended  
And attain Vaikuṇṭam (the high heaven)

**Note**

Unlike the worshipper at the sanctum, remaining worried about the safety of the pair of sandals left by him at the temple gate, the Lord attended to His cosmic duties first, such as the sustenance of the worlds and their contents in His stomach during the deluge, and then addressed Himself to the task of eating up the curds and butter in the pastoral village of Gokula, with no let or hindrance from other quarters. Even as pregnant women get extra-nourishment, the Lord, holding in His stomach all things and beings, had all the nourishment He could have in Gokula.
