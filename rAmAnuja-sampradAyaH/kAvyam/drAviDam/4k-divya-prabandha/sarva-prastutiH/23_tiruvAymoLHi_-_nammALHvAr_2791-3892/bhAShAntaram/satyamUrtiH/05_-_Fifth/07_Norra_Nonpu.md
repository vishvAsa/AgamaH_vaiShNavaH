## 00 Intro5.7
For the nonce, the Āḻvār attempted to sustain himself by impersonating the Lord, even as the damsels of Vṛndāvan did, during that oppressive break in the middle of the rapturous ‘Rāsa Krīḍā’. But there, Lord Kṛṣṇa reappeared in an even more enchanting form than in the earlier session. But here, the Lord is still keeping Himself away from the Āḻvār, although, on the previous occasions, He obliged the Āḻvār with His appearance, mental vision of course, whenever the Āḻvār’s longing for such communion was far too intense. Pondering within himself, the Āḻvār apprehends that the Lord might either want him to adopt other means such as karma, Jñāna, Bhakti yogas or intend to give him up on the ground that he was pursuing other means, instead of looking upon Him, as the sole Means. The Āḻvār, therefore, hastens to clarify his true stand at the feet of the Lord, enshrined in Vāṉamāmalai. This pilgrim centre, also known as (irīvara Maṅkai, Cirīvara Maṅkalam and Nāṅkuṉēri, is deep south in the Tamiḻ Nādu. In each of the various pilgrim centres, the Lord displays one of His numerous auspicious traits prominently. In Vāṉamāmalai (Cirīvaramaṅkalam) shines, with extra-brilliance, the Lord’s generosity, whereby He gives out to the devotees seeking Him with single-minded devotion, His very feet as their Sole Refuge, (vide aphorism 163 of Ācārya Hṛdayam).




## 5.7.1
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நோற்ற நோன்பு இலேன் நுண் அறிவு இலேன் ஆகிலும் இனி உன்னை விட்டு  
ஒன்றும் ஆற்ற கிற்கின்றிலேன் அரவின் அணை அம்மானே  
சேற்றுத் தாமரை செந்நெல் ஊடு மலர் சிரீவரமங்கல நகர்  
வீற்றிருந்த எந்தாய்! உனக்கு மிகை அல்லேன் அங்கே.

nōṟṟa nōṉpu ilēṉ nuṇ aṟivu ilēṉ ākilum iṉi uṉṉai viṭṭu  
oṉṟum āṟṟa kiṟkiṉṟilēṉ araviṉ aṇai ammāṉē  
cēṟṟut tāmarai cennel ūṭu malar cirīvaramaṅkala nakar  
vīṟṟirunta entāy! uṉakku mikai allēṉ aṅkē.

**English translation of verse 5.7.1:**

Oh, Lord on serpent-bed, in Cirīvaramaṅkalam you graciously reside.  
Abounding in paddy fields rich where blooms lotus fine;  
Rituals I haven’t performed any, while of knowledge acute I am devoid  
And yet, even for a while, apart from you I can’t remain;  
Surely, you can’t keep me outside the scope of your protection.

### Notes

\(i\) There was a time when the Āḻvār knew neither his essential nature (Svasvarūpa) nor that of the Supreme Lord. It was but natural that he should have foregone Him while in that state; how could he be made to forego Him even now when he is quite alive to His greatness and his own lowliness? But then, he hasn’t pursued any of the well-known paths of discipline, karma yoga or Jñāna yoga or Bhakti yoga. The Āḻvār is, therefore, in the predicament of a hungry person without food, the means of appeasing his hunger. He wants the Lord, as the liberal Benefactor, to feed him looking to his enormous appetite (God-hunger) and he can’t think of any other means but the Lord Himself.

\(ii\) Reference to the Lord's serpent—bed (Ādi Śeṣa) in the opening line, is suggestive of the Āḻvār’s inordinate longing to serve the Lord, in ever so many ways, like the Ādiśeṣa. Here then is the suggestion to the Lord to enlist the Āḻvār in His service, like Ādiśeṣa.




## 5.7.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அங்குற்றேன் அல்லேன் இங்குற்றேன் அல்லேன் உன்னைக் காணும் அவாவில் வீழ்ந்து நான்  
எங்குற்றேனும் அல்லேன் இலங்கை செற்ற அம்மானே  
திங்கள் சேர் மணி மாடம் நீடு சிரீவரமங்கலநகர் உறை  
சங்கு சக்கரத்தாய்! தமியேனுக்கு அருளாயே.

aṅkuṟṟēṉ allēṉ iṅkuṟṟēṉ allēṉ uṉṉaik kāṇum avāvil vīḻntu nāṉ  
eṅkuṟṟēṉum allēṉ ilaṅkai ceṟṟa ammāṉē  
tiṅkaḷ cēr maṇi māṭam nīṭu cirīvaramaṅkalanakar uṟai  
caṅku cakkarattāy! tamiyēṉukku aruḷāyē.

**English translation of verse 5.7.2:**

Neither here nor there nor anywhere else am I,  
But to behold you, oh. Sire, Who routed Ilaṅkai! I am sunk  
In desire deep; my Lord wielding conch and discus, in Cirīvaramaṅkai,  
With spacious streets and castles, stately and shining.  
Pray do I unto you to salve this soul forlorn.

### Notes

The Āḻvār submits that he does not belong to the happy band of denizens in the high Heavens, enjoying the immortal bliss of perpetual Divine Service nor has he joined the rank and file of the worldlings, following one or the other of the several paths of discipline, calling for personal effort to attain to His feet. There is also no question of his falling in line with the latter category, at least hereafter as he stands enthralled by the Lord’s exquisite beauty and is languishing to behold Him, unable to brook separation from Him. Surely, He who routed Laṅkā and reclaimed Sītā, should have no difficulty in rooting the Āḻvār out from ‘Saṃsāra’. Could there be a better recipient of His grace than the Āḻvār who is solely dependent on it?




## 5.7.3
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கருளப் புள் கொடி சக்கரப் படை வான நாட! என் கார்முகில் வண்ணா  
பொருள் அல்லாத என்னைப் பொருளாக்கி அடிமைகொண்டாய்  
தெருள் கொள் நான்மறை வல்லவர் பலர்வாழ் சிரீவரமங்கலநகர்க்கு  
அருள்செய்து அங்கு இருந்தாய்! அறியேன் ஒரு கைம்மாறே

karuḷap puḷ koṭi cakkarap paṭai vāṉa nāṭa! eṉ kārmukil vaṇṇā  
poruḷ allāta eṉṉaip poruḷākki aṭimaikoṇṭāy  
teruḷ koḷ nāṉmaṟai vallavar palarvāḻ cirīvaramaṅkalanakarkku  
aruḷceytu aṅku iruntāy! aṟiyēṉ oru kaimmāṟē

**English translation of verse 5.7.3:**

Oh, Lord of Heaven, on Your banner is Karuḷaṉ and in Your hand  
Is the discus valiant, my cloud-hued Lord, mere chaff was I  
And yet, You Who gracefully reside in Cirīvaramaṅkai,  
Full of Vedic scholars of knowledge chaste, have turned  
This dud into Your vassal [hymning Your glory great]  
I know not how to recompense You, my Benefactor great.

### Note

In between the preceding stanza and this one, there would appear to have ensued a scintillating dialogue between the Lord and the Āḻvār. Put briefly, the Āḻvār who prayed in the last song for the bestowal on Him of the Lord’s grace, gets pulled up by Him, saying that there should be due merit in him deserving of His grace. The Āḻvār is quick to put the ball back into the Lord’s court, by pointing out that He had already enlisted him. a mere dud with no equipment whatever, in His service. Had it not been for His grace galore, the Āḻvār wouldn't be able to render the glorious service (vācika kaiṅkarya) of singing the Tiruvāymoḻi, songs, *par excellence*. And so, the Āḻvār prays unto the Lord to go on bestowing His spontaneous grace on him as before, without looking for any merit (Means) in him; in fact, he has none whatsoever, comparable to the end in view, and what little merit there is in him already, has also been implanted by Him only. Oh, how gracious is the Supreme Lord of Heaven, obliging the pious and scholarly residents of Vāṉamāmalai with His nectarean presence, in the same way He does unto the denizens of Heaven and how indeed can the Āḻvār recompense Him for His Grace galore!




## 5.7.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மாறு சேர் படை நூற்றுவர் மங்க ஓர் ஐவர்க்கு ஆய் அன்று மாயப்போர் பண்ணி  
நீறு செய்த எந்தாய்! நிலம் கீண்ட அம்மானே  
தேறு ஞானத்தர் வேத வேள்வி அறாச் சிரீவரமங்கலநகர்  
ஏறி வீற்றிருந்தாய்! உன்னை எங்கு எய்தக் கூவுவனே?

tēṟu ñāṉattar vēta vēḷvi aṟāc cirīvaramaṅkalanakar  
ēṟi vīṟṟiruntāy! uṉṉai eṅku eytak kūvuvaṉē?

**English translation of verse 5.7.4:**

The five (brothers) You befriended and had their hundred (cousins) routed,  
It was a battle of wonderful strategy, by you directed;  
My Lord, the Earth You once salvaged and now have You resorted  
To Cirīvaramaṅkalam, inhabited by men of wisdom sound,  
Where Vedic rituals go on, all the year round;  
You, where and how indeed can I attain?

### Notes

\(i\) In accordance with the Lord’s avowed creed, He looks upon all impartially, no one is His foe or His favourite on grounds of caste, culture, beauty and temperament.

And yet, the Lord completely identifies Himself with His lovers, who stand rivetted to Him in thought, word, and deed and He looks upon their enemies as His. That is how, the Kauravas (hundred brothers) who were hostile to the Pāṇḍavas (their five cousins), became His enemies.

\(ii\) It was a wonderful battle indeed where devious methods were justifiably adopted to quell the wicked opponents. The Lord is known for upholding truth and justice and yet, if He adopted devious methods for outwitting the wicked opponents, it was perfectly justified.

\(iii\) Even as the Lord condescendingly came down and took His abode in Vāṉamāmalai like the pious ones of sound knowledge, who had already settled there and mingled with them delightfully, the Āḻvār wants the Lord to take the initiative in his case also, that is, He should either come down to him or take him up to His feet, adding to the list of many favours already heaped on him.




## 5.7.5
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

எய்தக் கூவுதல் ஆவதே எனக்கு? எவ்வ தெவ்வத்துள் ஆயுமாய் நின்று  
கைதவங்கள் செய்யும் கரு மேனி அம்மானே  
செய்த வேள்வியர் வையத்தேவர் அறாச் சிரீவரமங்கலநகர்  
கைதொழ இருந்தாய் அது நானும் கண்டேனே.

eytak kūvutal āvatē eṉakku? evva tevvattuḷ āyumāy niṉṟu  
kaitavaṅkaḷ ceyyum karu mēṉi ammāṉē  
ceyta vēḷviyar vaiyattēvar aṟāc cirīvaramaṅkalanakar  
kaitoḻa iruntāy atu nāṉum kaṇṭēṉē.

**English translation of verse 5.7.5:**

Oh, dark-hued Lord, it isn’t proper that I make any effort  
To attain you; you would with the ungodly mingle and pervert  
Their minds and get their brute strength cut out;  
Adored by Brahmins who the vedic rituals have put thro,  
Reside you do in Cirīvaramaṅkalam, well, I have seen it too.

### Notes

\(i\) *The Lord to the Āḻvār*: “You cry out as if You haven’t received any benefit from me; haven’t You been shown my Iconic Form in Cirīvaramaṅkai?”

*Āḻvār to the Lord*: “Sire, I don’t deny that, but that is hardly enough for me. I do long for perennial service at Your lotus feet”.

Īśvara (God) is the ‘Svāmi’ (Master) while the Cetana (Jīva, the individual Soul) is the ‘Svuṃ’ (Property). It is this fundamental relationship that gives rise to the inescapable obligation of the Master in regard to His property, a matter of personal gain for Him indeed. It is against this back-ground that the Āḻvār points out, in this song, the impropriety of the property trying to get at the Master; it should actually be the other way round.

\(ii\) By sheer eloquence and fallacious arguments, the Lord did, as Buddha, pervert the minds of the ungodly Asuras, bent upon torturing and tormenting others, and beat them back. If these methods did not succeed, He would, in the last resort, mystify them and render them defunct by exhibiting His exquisite charm, vide detailed notes under V-10-4




## 5.7.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஏனம் ஆய் நிலம் கீண்ட என் அப்பனே! கண்ணா! என்றும் என்னை ஆளுடை  
வான நாயகனே! மணி மாணிக்கச்சுடரே  
தேன மாம்பொழில் தண் சிரீவரமங்கலத்தவர் கைதொழ உறை  
வானமாமலையே! அடியேன் தொழ வந்தருளே. (2)

tēṉa māmpoḻil taṇ cirīvaramaṅkalattavar kaitoḻa uṟai  
vāṉamāmalaiyē! aṭiyēṉ toḻa vantaruḷē. (2)

**English translation of verse 5.7.6:**

Oh, Lord Vāṉamāmalai, reside you do in cool Cirīvaramaṅkai,  
Surrounded by mango-orchards with honey in plenty,  
And adored by its residents; as the Boar huge You pulled  
The Earth out and put it back in its place, my Lord,  
Me you have enlisted as Your vassal, oh Lord of heaven,  
Radiant like gem and ruby, oh, Kaṇṇā, Pray come down  
Unto me here that this vassal may also offer Thee salutation.

### Notes

\(i\) ‘Vāṉamāmalai’ is alike the name of the Deity and the Pilgrim centre. It means, ‘mountain, sky-high’; so very imposing is the Lord’s Image there indeed and this description fits in admirably.

\(ii\) The Lord’s incarnations are referred to by the Āḻvār, only to remind the Lord of the basic idea, namely, the elevation of the souls down below. ‘Avatāra’ means descent and He comes down to push up the subjects, working like a pulley system. The resuscitation of the Earth from under the waters of the Deluge, the Lord assuming the form of a Boar for this purpose, is specially mentioned by the Āḻvār to remind the Lord that he should also be similarly rescued from the bottomless ocean of Saṃsāra (worldly life).

\(iii\) The Lord is required to walk down to the Āḻvār’s place, for the latter to enjoy His glorious gait.




## 5.7.7
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வந்தருளி என் நெஞ்சு இடம் கொண்ட வானவர் கொழுந்தே! உலகுக்கு ஓர்-  
முந்தைத் தாய் தந்தையே! முழு ஏழ் உலகும் உண்டாய்!  
செந்தொழிலவர் வேத வேள்வி அறாச் சிரீவரமங்கலநகர்

**English translation of verse 5.7.7:**

Oh, Chief of Celestials, You deigned to come and lodge  
In my heart; oh, Primate, You sustained, (during the Deluge),  
All the worlds in Your stomach and now Your limitless grace  
You do shed in Cirīvaramaṅkai where the pious ones  
Of good deeds are in vedic rituals engaged;  
Pray, despise not this vassal, my Lord.

### Notes

\(i\) In the preceding song, the Āḻvār longed to see the Lord in His Iconic Form at Vāṉamāmalai, right where he was (inside the hollow of the tamarind tree in Āḻvār Tirunakari temple). But the Lord has not responded yet, giving room for the Āḻvār’s apprehension of indifference on His part and hence he prays now that he should not be despised and denied the favour sought by him.

\(ii\) This song, where the Āḻvār gratefully acknowledges the boundless grace of the Lord of the Celestials in choosing his heart as His habitat, is said to have had a special appeal for Śrī Parāśara Bhaṭṭar. He asked his disciple, Nañcīyar, to recite this song, and, following it up himself in rapturous strain, he observed with great feeling that it was indeed very nice of Saints like Nammāḻvār to have bequeathed such verses of melting tenderness to soften our stony hearts. He added that our hearts which are no better than barren rock, rough and rugged, despite the severest course of discipliṅe and austerity, such as ‘yama’ ‘niyama’ etc, could be mellowed, tempered and liquefied, only by verses like this. Nañcīyar was never tired of relating this incident to his disciples.




## 5.7.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அகற்ற நீ வைத்த மாய வல் ஐம்புலன்களாம் அவை நன்கு அறிந்தனன்  
அகற்றி என்னையும் நீ அரும் சேற்றில் வீழ்த்திகண்டாய்  
பகல் கதிர் மணி மாடம் நீடு சிரீவரமங்கை வாணனே என்றும்-  
புகற்கு அரிய எந்தாய்! புள்ளின் வாய் பிளந்தானே!

akaṟṟa nī vaitta māya val aimpulaṉkaḷām avai naṉku aṟintaṉaṉ

pukaṟku ariya entāy! puḷḷiṉ vāy piḷantāṉē!

**English translation of verse 5.7.8:**

Well aware am 1 of the mischief of the senses five,  
You have set upon me to keep me aside  
And push me back into the fell bog of pleasures sensual.  
Oh, Lord, residing in Cirīvaramaṅkai with its castles tall,  
You are, my Sire, ever beyond reach  
(Of the ungodly), oh, you who tore off the demoniac bird’s beak!

### Note

The Āḻvār pleaded, in the preceding song, that He should not be despised by the Lord and made to drift away from Him. The Lord, who had endowed the Āḻvār with perfect knowledge of the Divine, could not, however, appreciate the basis of the Āḻvār’s complaint. The Āḻvār makes his position abundantly clear in this song. Situated as he is, in this land of nescience, open to the hazards of succumbing to the mischief of the senses, he is afraid of untoward developments, despite all the knowledge imparted to him by the Lord. The Āḻvār, therefore, prays that he be untethered from the present moorings, so as to eliminate the possible risk of contamination, even as He tore off Bakāsura’s (the demoniac bird’s) beak.




## 5.7.9
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

புள்ளின் வாய் பிளந்தாய்! மருது இடை போயினாய்! எருது ஏழ் அடர்த்த என்-  
கள்ள மாயவனே! கருமாணிக்கச் சுடரே  
தெள்ளியார் திரு நான்மறைகள் வல்லார் மலி தண் சிரீவரமங்கை  
யுள் இருந்த எந்தாய்! அருளாய் உய்யுமாறு எனக்கே.

puḷḷiṉ vāy piḷantāy! marutu iṭai pōyiṉāy! erutu ēḻ aṭartta eṉ-

teḷḷiyār tiru nāṉmaṟaikaḷ vallār mali taṇ cirīvaramaṅkai  
yuḷ irunta entāy! aruḷāy uyyumāṟu eṉakkē.

**English translation of verse 5.7.9:**

My Lord, staying in cool Cirīvaramaṅkai where do dwell  
Many a vedic scholar with knowledge sound! You tamed the bulls,  
Wondrous and tricky, the bird’s beak You did pull and quell,  
‘Tween the twin trees You crawled, oh Sire of sapphire hue!’  
Pray let me know the means of attaining You.

### Note

In the preceding song, the Āḻvār laid two charges at the Lord’s door, namely, (i) he had been kept away from the Lord and (ii) he got bogged down in the difficult terrain of samsāra. The Lord sent a feeler round, suggesting that it was due to his past sins he was in that predicament, to which this song is the rejoinder. Surely, the Āḻvār’s sins were not as tough as the evil forces referred to in this song, which the Lord destroyed effortlessly. Removal of the so-called impediment, in the case of the Āḻvār, was so very trivial that the Lord should not hesitate to cut it out and enable the Āḻvār to render service at the Lord’s feet, even as the pious Vaiṣṇavas of Vāṉamāmalai, with blemishless knowledge, do.




## 5.7.10
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஆறு எனக்கு நின் பாதமே சரண் ஆகத் தந்தொழிந்தாய் உனக்கு ஓர்கைம்  
மாறு நான் ஒன்று இலேன் எனது ஆவியும் உனதே  
சேறு கொள் கரும்பும் பெரும் செந்நெலும் மலி தண் சிரீவரமங்கை

**English translation of verse 5.7.10:**

Oh, Teyvanāyakā, You wear on Your crown tuḷaci garland of fragrance sweet  
And grace cool cirīvaramaṅkai, with paddy and sugarcane in plenty;  
As my sole refuge. You have unto me vouchsafed Your lovely feet;  
How indeed can 1 repay You for this gracious bounty?  
Even my soul is Yours and there’s nothing I can unto you offer

### Notes

\(i\) ‘Teivanāyakaṉ is the name of the Deity, enshrined in Vāṉamāmalai, meaning the overlord of all godlings, the Supreme Lord.

\(ii\) This decad began by emphasising the resourcelessness of the Āḻvār, that is, absence of any means other than the Lord Himself, (ākiñcanya). And now, in this concluding song, the Āḻvār compliments himself on the strength of his conviction that the Lord is at once the Means and the End and that the Lord’s lovely feet, the ultimate destination, constitute the Means as well, his sole refuge. Giving up the means which have śāstraic backing and desisting from the pursuit of the prescribed paths of discipline, should not, however, be construed as being tantamount to atheism or loss of faith in the sanctity of the Scriptures. The point driven home here is the Āḻvār’s robust faith and love in the Supreme Lord as the Means and the End, rolled into one, and sticking to Him exclusively. This is like Service unto the Lord taking precedence over the daily rituals enjoined by the Śāstras. No harm will accrue to the Subject by skipping over the rituals, in this particular context, even as the snake-charmer, armed with the requisite herbal antidote, inserts his hand into the viper’s mouth with impunity. Any other person, not so equipped, will meet certain death, if he ventures to take liberties with the poisonous snake; likewise, it will be grievously wrong to give up the religious pursuits enjoined by the Śāstras, when not actually engaged in Divine Service.

\(iii\) Aphorism 19 of “Ācārya hṛdayam” succinctly brings out the difference between those who pin their faith to the eight-syllabled ‘Tirumantra’, inculcating a sense of total surrender to His grace and complete subservience to the Lord as His eternal vassal and those guided by other texts. The latter category (Śāstrajñas, well-versed in Śāstras) can be likened to those trying to swim across deep waters, clinging to an inflated tube or raft with one hand and oaring with the other-a combination of the light obtained from the Śāstras with their own individual effort. The former category is like unto those seated on the cross planks of a boat (the Lord’s grace) launched into the waters, eagerly looking forward to reaching the shore, thus depending entirely on the Lord’s grace, with no effort of their own.

\(iv\) Called upon by the Lord to offer unto Him whatever the Āḻvār deems proper by way of expressing his gratitude to Him for sustaining in him such a strong conviction, the Āḻvār submits that there is nothing of his own to offer and even his soul actually belongs to Him. The Āḻvār says: “How can this insignificant self pay you back, the overlord of the exalted Devas? You are the incessant Benefactor and You are so full, above wants of any kind, that you need hardly anything from me. While there are those who care not for your favours and engage themselves in mad pursuit of food and raiment, there are also the silly brats who fancy that they have requited you for favours received at your hands”.




## 5.7.11
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

தெய்வ நாயகன் நாரணன் திரிவிக்கிரமன் அடி இணைமிசை  
கொய் கொள் பூம் பொழில் சூழ் குருகூர்ச் சடகோபன்

vaikal pāṭa vallār vāṉōrkku ārā amutē. (2)

**English translation of verse 5.7.11:**

Those that zealously chant, with no break, these songs ten.  
Which unto the Lord of Cirīvaramaṅkai pertain.  
Out of the thousand composed by Caṭakōpaṉ  
Of Kurukūr, adorned by many a flower garden,  
Adoring the feet of Tiruvikkiramaṉ, the Lord Supreme,  
Will unto Celestials be delectable like insatiable cream.

### Note

Those that enter into the spirit of these ten songs, highlighting the Lord’s boundless love for His devotees, whose reclamation is indeed His gain and His readiness to offer them His very feet, as their sole refuge (vide-V-7-10, the keysong), will indeed be highly delectable to the Nitya Sūrīs in Heaven.
