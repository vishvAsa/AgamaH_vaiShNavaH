## 00 Intro9.6
In the tenth song of the last decad, the Āḻvār’s declaration that he had joined his Lord in Heaven and that his physical frame, left behind, would also fall off in a day or two, might make one feel that it marked the end of his stay in this abobe. And yet, the Āḻvār remained inside the hollow of the sacred tamarind tree for quite some time and sang some more of these nectarean hymns. How and what indeed sustained him and kept him on, in this abode? Could it be that the Lord obliged him with His sweet vision and sustained him? No, He did not. It was only the Āḻvār’s vivid, rather, absorbing recollection of the immensity of the Lord’s love during their erstwhile union, experienced by him in VIII-7, that warmed him up. This is how the contemplation, in retrospect, of her uninterrupted and exclusive enjoyment of Lord Rāma’s sweet company and auspicious traits for twelve long years in the Palace at Ayodhyā, helped to sustain Sita, during her captivity in Laṅkā. Actually, it is the Supreme Lord, Who, as the Internal Controller, induced this kind of reminiscence and the resultant effervescence of love in the Āḻvār and got, out of him, the further songs of this illuminating hymnal.

The illustrious Nampiḷḷai would explain the prolongation of the Āḻvār’s stay in this abode even at this crucial stage, as follows:

\(i\) The Āḻvār having resolved, as it were, to sustain himself by singing a thousand hymns, as seen from the end-song of each decad, right from the beginning, the Lord is also keen that the Āḻvār keeps it up and helps him indirectly, by not snatching him away earlier;

\(ii\) The Lord’s own eagerness to listen to these thousand songs, in their entirety; and

\(iii\) It is the great good fortune of the ‘Samsārīs’, caught up in the vortex of worldly life, that the Āḻvār stays on and continues to feed them with these nectarean hymns.

It is evident that the Lord, enshrined in the pilgrim centre, called Tirukkāṭkarai (in Kerala), kindled in the Āḻvār this kind of reminiscence and made him revert to the mental state, as in VIII-7, seeing that this decad lauds the glory and greatness of that Deity.




## 9.6.1
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

உருகுமால் நெஞ்சம் உயிரின் பரமன்றி  
பெருகுமால் வேட்கையும் என்செய்கேன் தொண்டனேன்  
தெருவுஎல்லாம் காவிகமழ் திருக்காட்கரை  
மருவிய மாயன்தன் மாயம் நினைதொறே. (2)

urukumāl neñcam uyiriṉ paramaṉṟi  
perukumāl vēṭkaiyum eṉceykēṉ toṇṭaṉēṉ  
teruvuellām kāvikamaḻ tirukkāṭkarai  
maruviya māyaṉtaṉ māyam niṉaitoṟē. (2)

**English translation of verse 9.6.1:**

What can this doting vassal do, whose love knows no bounds  
Unto the mystic Lord, Who in Tirukkāṭkarai resides lovingly,  
Whose streets are perfumed with scarlet lily?  
As I do His wondrous traits contemplate, my heart thaws down

**Notes:**

The Āḻvār wants to know how to stem the on-rush of his Godlove and the resultant melting down of his heart, so as to remain steady and stable and enjoy the Lord at Tirukkāṭkarai. But this is next to impossible because he is overwhelmed by the Deity’s extra-ordinary love and condescension. The heart is the principal functionary for enjoyment and if it gives way, no enjoyment would be possible, like unto the predicament of a man, launched into a river in spate, whose rubber raft starts leaking, right at the commencement. How can the poor little thing, the Āḻvār’s soul, smaller than a spec, contain his God-love, full and flooding? The streets of the pilgrim centre are full of fragrance all over, without distinction of main roads and by-roads and lanes and if this is the case with the exterior, what to say of the interior, the Sanctum where the Deity, the very embodiment of fragrance, ‘Sarva gandaḥ’ as the scriptures put it, stays!




## 9.6.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நினைதொறும் சொல்லும்தொறும் நெஞ்சு இடிந்துஉகும்  
வினைகொள்சீர் பாடிலும் வேம்எனதுஆர்உயிர்  
சுனைகொள் பூஞ்சோலைத் தென்காட்கரைஎன்அப்பா  
நினைகிலேன் நான்உனக்கு ஆட்செய்யும் நீர்மையே.

niṉaitoṟum collumtoṟum neñcu iṭintuukum  
viṉaikoḷcīr pāṭilum vēmeṉatuāruyir  
cuṉaikoḷ pūñcōlait teṉkāṭkaraieṉappā  
niṉaikilēṉ nāṉuṉakku āṭceyyum nīrmaiyē.

**English translation of verse 9.6.2:**

Oh, Sire, residing in Teṉkāṭkarai, with many a pond and orchard fine,  
As I dote on Your traits auspicious that steal sway my sins,  
My heart gives way and when to utter Your glory I begin,  
Melts down my mind, my soul would with passion burn  
If I your praise did sing, serve You I know not how I can.

**Notes:**

The Lord’s tender solicitude for the Āḻvār, His amazing simplicity and astounding love, exhibited in VIII-7, made it appear that the Āḻvār was His sole concern and He literally doted on him. In trying to recollect, in this decad, the extra-ordinary posture of the Lord, the Āḻvār only finds that he is attempting the impossible. His mind was not equal to the task, giving way right at the beginning, like unto the embankment of the river, swept off by the flood waters, leaving no trace of its former existence. Even when the mind is not active and virtually defunct, the tongue would utter the Lord’s glory mechanically and these words, trickling down the ears to the region of the heart, would only corrode it still further and disintegrate it. How then could the Āḻvār think of serving the Lord, especially when he is struck dumb and insensate, ruminating over the Lord’s erstwhile utterance unto him, “Thee, I shall serve”, reversing the normal order of things?




## 9.6.3
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நீர்மையால் நெஞ்சம் வஞ்சித்துப் புகுந்து என்னை  
ஈர்மைசெய்து என்உயிர்ஆய் என்உயிர் உண்டான்  
சீர்மல்குசோலைத் தென்காட்கரைஎன்அப்பன்  
கார்முகில் வண்ணன்தன் கள்வம் அறிகிலேன்.

nīrmaiyāl neñcam vañcittup pukuntu eṉṉai  
īrmaiceytu eṉuyirāy eṉuyir uṇṭāṉ  
cīrmalkucōlait teṉkāṭkaraieṉappaṉ  
kārmukil vaṇṇaṉtaṉ kaḷvam aṟikilēṉ.

**English translation of verse 9.6.3:**

Methought the Lord got inside me, being my Master,  
So as to sustain me, but what was really the matter?  
Once inside, He caught me unawares and my mind did shatter  
By His simplicity galore, wanting to serve me, His vassal;  
The stealthy ways of the cloud-hued Lord, Who does dwell,  
In Teṉkāṭkarai, amid lovely gardens, I can’t tell.

**Notes:**

If only the Āḻvār had a prior knowledge of the Lord’s intention to reverse the normal gear and serve him, His born vassal, he would not have allowed Him access to the interior of his heart. Having gained entry, the Lord displayed His amazing simplicity whereby He made the Āḻvār just melt down and dwindle. Having kindled God-love in the Āḻvār, the Lord just devoured him through His all-conquering love.




## 9.6.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அறிகிலேன் தன்னுள் அனைத்துஉலகும் நிற்க  
நெறிமையால் தானும் அவற்றுள் நிற்கும் பிரான்  
வெறிகமழ்சோலைத் தென்காட்கரை என்அப்பன்  
சிறியவென்னாயிருண்ட திருஅருளே.

aṟikilēṉ taṉṉuḷ aṉaittuulakum niṟka  
neṟimaiyāl tāṉum avaṟṟuḷ niṟkum pirāṉ  
veṟikamaḻcōlait teṉkāṭkarai eṉappaṉ  
ciṟiyaveṉṉāyiruṇṭa tiruaruḷē.

**English translation of verse 9.6.4:**

The Lord Supreme does all things and beings sustain  
And in them all abides; it is beyond me to ascertain  
Why my Sire dwelling in Teṉkāṭkarai, amid fragrant gardens,  
Should on this petty soul deign to lavish His affections.

**Notes:**

It is indeed incredible that the Lord, higher than whom there is none, should pounce upon a frail being like the Āḻvār, with such avidity. As Nampiḷḷai would put it, the Āḻvār is at a loss to know whether the Lord did so out of love or He was out to kill him with His overwhelming kindness. The Lord just grabbed at the Āḻvār, saying that the latter, in his native humility, was not conscious of his greatness.




## 9.6.5
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

திருவருள் செய்பவன்போல என்னுள்புகுந்து  
உருவமும் ஆருயிரும் உடனே உண்டான்  
திருவளர்சோலைத் தென்காட்கரைஎன்அப்பன்  
கருவளர்மேனி என்கண்ணன் கள்வங்களே.

tiruvaruḷ ceypavaṉpōla eṉṉuḷpukuntu  
uruvamum āruyirum uṭaṉē uṇṭāṉ  
tiruvaḷarcōlait teṉkāṭkaraieṉappaṉ  
karuvaḷarmēṉi eṉkaṇṇaṉ kaḷvaṅkaḷē.

**English translation of verse 9.6.5:**

How stealthy indeed are the ways of the dark-hued Lord!  
Kaṇṇaṉ, my Sire, Who in Teṉkāṭkarai dwells amid lovely orchards,  
Entered my heart as if to bestow on me His grace  
And reclaim me, His vassal, but He did on me pounce,  
My body foul and soul dear alike, with delight immense,

**Notes:**

The Lord sheds His grace, according to the Āḻvār, when He takes service from him, true to his essential nature. The Āḻvār welcomed the Lord’s entry into the interior of his heart, thinking that it would help to sustain his basic stance, as His exclusive vassal from time immemorial. But what actually transpired sent him aghast. Prior to the dawn of true knowledge of his essential nature and his relationship unto the Lord, the Āḻvār mistook his body for the soul and lavished his affections on it (body). But the spiritually regenerated Āḻvār would hate it, as something foul, full of dirt, as set out in the opening song of his very first hymnal (Tiruviruttam). And yet, the Lord, in His unbounded love for the Āḻvār, took to his body also with great relish, making the Āḻvār look on Him with bewildering excitement.




## 9.6.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

என்கண்ணன் கள்வம் எனக்குச் செம்மாய்நிற்கும்  
அம்கண்ணன் உண்ட என்ஆர்உயிர்க்கோதுஇது  
புன்கண்மை எய்தி புலம்பி இராப்பகல்  
என்கண்ணன் என்று அவன்காட்கரைஏத்துமே

eṉkaṇṇaṉ kaḷvam eṉakkuc cemmāyniṟkum  
amkaṇṇaṉ uṇṭa eṉāruyirkkōtuitu  
puṉkaṇmai eyti pulampi irāppakal  
eṉkaṇṇaṉ eṉṟu avaṉkāṭkaraiēttumē

**English translation of verse 9.6.6:**

Guileless that I am, I fell an easy prey  
To the wily overtures of Kaṇṇaṉ, my Lord,  
My soul, by Him sapped, cries out His name, night and day,  
And on Kāṭkarai meditates where He does reside.

**Notes:**

The Āḻvār, who points the accusing finger at the Lord and calls Him names while in a state of desolation due to separation from Him, sinks all such thoughts, rather, forgets all about them, when the Lord presents Himself before him. Here then is the tantalising charm of the Lord. The Āḻvār took Him at His face value and thoroughly enjoyed his erstwhile union with Him. But when the Lord withdrew Himself from the Āḻvār, the latter was consigned to the bottom-most depths of dejection and felt completely sapped. And yet, he would keep ruminating over His blandishments during their erstwhile union.




## 9.6.7
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

காட்கரைஏத்தும் அதனுள் கண்ணாஎன்னும்  
வேட்கை நோய்கூர நினைந்து கரைந்துகும்  
ஆட்கொள் வான்ஒத்து என்னுயிருண்ட மாயனால்  
கோள்குறைபட்டது என்னாருயிர் கோள்உண்டே.

kāṭkaraiēttum ataṉuḷ kaṇṇāeṉṉum  
vēṭkai nōykūra niṉaintu karaintukum  
āṭkoḷ vāṉottu eṉṉuyiruṇṭa māyaṉāl  
kōḷkuṟaipaṭṭatu eṉṉāruyir kōḷuṇṭē.

**English translation of verse 9.6.7:**

The wondrous Lord did my soul consume  
After getting inside me, as if to make me His vassal,  
And yet, what little remains of my soul does proclaim  
The glory of Kāṭkarai and calls Him that therein dwells,  
Oh, my Lord Kaṇṇā, love-sick, my soul dwindles  
Recounting His ravishing love during our erstwhile union.

**Notes:**

Consumed by God-love, the Āḻvār feels that he has been fully consumed by God. Still, he keeps pining for Him and the pilgrim centre where He stands enshrined and this shows that a little bit of his partly eaten-up soul is still lingering. Wonder-struck and overwhelmed indeed is the Āḻvār, that the Omniscient Lord should dote on a frail being, like him, in this manner.




## 9.6.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கோள்உண்டான் அன்றிவந்து என்உயிர் தான்உண்டான்  
நாளும்நாள்வந்து என்னை முற்றவும் தான்உண்டான்  
காளநீர்மேகத் தென்காட்கரை என்அப்பற்கு  
ஆள்அன்றேபட்டது என்ஆர்உயிர் பட்டதே.

kōḷuṇṭāṉ aṉṟivantu eṉuyir tāṉuṇṭāṉ  
nāḷumnāḷvantu eṉṉai muṟṟavum tāṉuṇṭāṉ  
kāḷanīrmēkat teṉkāṭkarai eṉappaṟku  
āḷaṉṟēpaṭṭatu eṉāruyir paṭṭatē.

**English translation of verse 9.6.8:**

There’s indeed nothing I could unto the Lord offer  
And yet, He did out of His voluntary grace enter  
My soul and day by day consumed it, in full;  
Should my cloud-hued Lord, Who does in Kāṭkarai dwell,  
Afflict thus my soul, simply because I am His vassal?

**Notes:**

\(i\) Even as the Āḻvār experiences the marvellous communications unfolded unto him from the Lord, an inexhaustible fountain of bliss, ever fresh, the Lord enjoys the Āḻvār with a similar feeling of reciprocity. The Āḻvār says:

(*a*) The Lord lavished His affections on the Āḻvār’s soul, purely as a matter of spontaneous grace;

(*b*) The Lord enjoyed the Āḻvār with an avidity which gave one the impression that He had never before come across one, so delicious and

(*c*) The Lord got hold of the Āḻvār, out of His own free-will and sweet grace (Paragata Svīkāra), as distinguished from ‘Svagata Svīkāra (*i.e*.) the Āḻvār courting Him.

\(ii\) It might be questioned how the all-pervading Lord is said to have feasted on the Āḻvār’s soul, smaller than a spec. What the Āḻvār emphasises here is the exuberance of the Lord’s love unto the Āḻvār, which makes even his tiny little soul loom large in His eyes. It was just a frugal fare that Vidura provided for Lord Kṛṣṇa and Yet, He ate it with such great relish that it looked like a number of courses, as indicated by the plural phraseology, ‘Vidurānnādhi’, in the text.

\(iii\) What precisely does the Āḻvār refer to, when he says that his soul is afflicted? It is sheer God-enjoyment, the rapturous contemplation of His auspicious attributes, transporting the Āḻvār to the realm of ecstasy, where one can hardly remain steady and stable. It is indeed a unique experience, very different from that of the ungodly, pitted against the Lord and smitten by His unrelenting arrows; the former is the region of the mind while the latter is purely physical.




## 9.6.9
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஆருயிர் பட்டது எனதுஉயிர் பட்டது  
பேர்இதழ்த் தாமரைக்கண் கனிவாயதுஓர்  
கார்எழில் மேகத் தென்காட்கரை கோயில்கொள்,  
சீர்எழில் நால்தடம்தோள் தெய்வ வாரிக்கே.

āruyir paṭṭatu eṉatuuyir paṭṭatu  
pēritaḻt tāmaraikkaṇ kaṉivāyatuōr  
kāreḻil mēkat teṉkāṭkarai kōyilkoḷ,  
cīreḻil nāltaṭamtōḷ teyva vārikkē.

**English translation of verse 9.6.9:**

Is there yet another soul like mine, smitten by love  
Unto the Lord of charm exquisite, with shoulders four,  
Lotus eyes, large and lovely, red lips and Form of beauty galore,  
Like unto dark clouds lovely, a delectable ocean unto the gods above,  
Who has in Teṉkāṭkarai, taken up His abode?

**Notes:**

To a question, supposed to have been put to the Āḻvār, as to whether all those engrossed with the Lord’s attributes are not in the same plight as he and why he should make much ado about it, this is the Āḻvār’s reply. He avers that even the ‘Nitya Sūrīs’ in Heaven, the Eternal Angels, known for their deep absorption in the Lord’s auspicious traits and incessant communion with Him do not suffer from an infatuation of this kind. The Lord’s delicious Form has brought on this devastation of the Āḻvār’s foul, enthralled by His bewitching eyes and coral lips. The Lord is the ocean which gave birth to a host of things including the minor deities (Celestials).




## 9.6.10
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வாரிக்கொண்டு உன்னைவிழுங்குவன் காணில்' என்று  
ஆர்வுஉற்ற என்னை ஒழிய என்னில் முன்னம்  
பாரித்துத் தான்என்னை முற்றப் பருகினான்  
கார்ஒக்கும் காட்கரைஅப்பன் கடியனே.

vārikkoṇṭu uṉṉaiviḻuṅkuvaṉ kāṇil' eṉṟu  
ārvuuṟṟa eṉṉai oḻiya eṉṉil muṉṉam  
pārittut tāṉeṉṉai muṟṟap parukiṉāṉ  
kārokkum kāṭkaraiappaṉ kaṭiyaṉē.

**English translation of verse 9.6.10:**

Eager I was indeed to gather the Lord up and devour  
If Him I could only behold but my cloud-hued Sire,  
Ever alert, Who in Kāṭkarai has taken abode,  
Did consume me, in full, going we'l ahead.

**Notes:**

It can be firmly asserted that this song is indeed the very cream of the entire hymnal, yielding, as it does, the grand thesis that attainment of the individual soul is the Lord’s great gain. This incidentally sets at naught the oft-debated concept of the individual gaining the Lord and striving to that end. In the ‘Song Celestial’, Lord Kṛṣṇa said, in a tone of frustration, that the Saint who looked upon Him, as All-in-one, the great Redeemer and Sole Sustainer, was scarce indeed. The Lord was looking for one such but couldn’t get hold of any. Barely six weeks after He went to the Celestium. Nammāḻvār, answering to this description, came into this world. The Āḻvār was consumed by God-love, too deep for words. But the Lord forestalled him, being ever alert and consumed him with His all-conquering love, proving more than a match for the Āḻvār. The Lord had indeed made herculean efforts to reclaim the Āḻvār and little wonder then, that He literally pounced upon him, after having kindled in him God-love of such great magnitude.




## 9.6.11
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கடியனாய்க் கஞ்சனைக் கொன்றபிரான் தன்னை  
கொடிமதிள் தென்குருகூர்ச் சடகோபன்சொல்  
வடிவுஅமைஆயிரத்து இப்பத்தினால் சன்மம்-

vaṭivuamaiāyirattu ippattiṉāl caṉmam-  
muṭivueyti nācamkaṇṭīrkaḷ emkāṉalē (2)

**English translation of verse 9.6.11:**

These songs ten, out of the comely thousand of Kurukūr Caṭakōpaṉ,  
Adoring the Benefactor great, Who to slay Kañcaṉ did hasten,  
Will unto the chanters ensure the destruction,  
Of the mirage [of Saṃsāra] and halt the recurrence of birth.

**Notes:**

The chanters of this decad, it is claimed, will get the terrific cycle of birth and rebirth halted, by cutting out the bondage of Saṃsāra, the root-cause of the dreadful succession of lives. The family ties and sensual pleasures breed empty and worthless desires and running after them is just as futile and meaningless as trying to quench one’s thirst, mistaking the mirage for a running brook.
