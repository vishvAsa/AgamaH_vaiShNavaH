## 00 Intro1.1
[Note: This work comprises ten centums, or hundred decades, each of which is called a ‘Tiruvāymoḻi’, which means ‘Inspired utterance’ as well as ‘Divine speech’, the speech from the holy mouth of the Saint. This is a skilled poetic composition in which each stanza begins with the closing word of the previous stanza or the phonetic sound thereof. Unlike the other hymns of the ‘Divya Prabandha’, Tiruvāymoḻi is accorded the special status of being chanted only inside the temples or at homes when the Deity is seated for congregational worship, and not when the Deity is taken out in the streets in ceremonial precession.]

In the opening song, the Saint exhorts his chastened mind to adore the dazzling, distress-dispelling feet of the Lord, the Supreme Benefactor, and attain salvation. Right at the very start, and that too in the opening line itself, the Āḻvār characterises God as one with perfections, all of the nature of bliss and love, the natural repository of innumerable auspicious traits of unlimited dimensions and thus easily scores over the ‘Upaniṣad’, which made a futile attempt to gauge the immeasurable bliss of the Supreme Lord and had to acknowledge defeat.[^1]

Such a beginning is the natural corollary to the manner in which the Lord captivated the Āḻvār. It was by exhibiting His innumerable auspicious qualities that the Lord attracted the Āḻvār, and therefore it was that he began with an ardent adoration of those very qualities, literally strangling those philosophising on a God devoid of form, attributes etc. as the illustrious Kūrattāḻvāṉ would put it. Exulting over the fact that we have, on Saint Nammāḻvār’s authority, a God of attributes, which ought to silence all those who philosophise on a God devoid of attributes, Kūrattāḷvāṉ would say Viṣṇupurāṇa (VI-5-84) corroborates this: it says the Lord is the essence possessing all blissful perfections. Does not Karṇa say, in the Bhīṣmaparva of the Mahābhārata, that even if all the worlds were assembled together and they were all to praise the perfections of the great victorious Viṣṇu (born as Kṛṣṇa, son of Vasudēva, bearing the discus, conch and sword) for millions of years it would not be exhaustive? Did not Tārā tell Vāli, her husband, that, in Rāma, the noblest glories meet? Again, did not the subjects, assembled in King Daśaratha’s court, proclaim that in all the earth none possessed the excellence of Rāma who, richly blest with graces, was to their hearts very dear? In the eleventh verse of his ‘Stotra Ratna’, Saint Yāmuna describes the Lord as one possessing an infinitude of super-excellent, auspicious perfections, conformable to His divine character”.

[^1]:  yato vāco nivartante aprāpya manasāsaḥa.

It may, however, be questioned how the Āḻvār relegated himself to the lower order of submission to the Lord through an appreciation of His auspicious traits instead of being automaticaḷḷy linked up with the Lord by virtue of the inherent trait (Śeṣatva or servitude) of the Individual Soul, as His eternal servant. Actually, it is not a case of relegation, as such, and it has to be taken that all the noblest qualities that converge in the Lord constitute yet another tangible source of attraction for the individual soul. That there has been no departure from the basic stand of Master-servant relationship between the Lord and the Āḻvār is brought out clearly in the fifth centum, third Tiruvāymoḻi, fifth stanza (indicated here and elsewhere by the notation V-3-5). There, in a moment of desolation caused by the snapping of his communion with the Lord, Nammāḻvār bitterly reproaches the Lord, as extremely selfish, unsympathetic, elusive, time-serving, deceitful, unfathomable etc. and yet he finds his ‘tyrannical’ mind clinging to the Lord, as the Sole Refuge, under all circumstances. The examples of Lakṣmaṇa and Sītā can also be brought in here, to clarify the stand of the Āḻvār. According to his own admission to Hanumān when Lakṣmaṇa first met him in the mountain slope of Ṛśyamūkha parvata,[^2] Lakṣmaṇa was enthralled into serving Śrī Rāma and following him, even in exile, by the latter’s sweet qualities. This does not, however, detract from Lakṣmaṇa’s basic stance. Being an incarnation of Ādiśeṣa (first servant), Lakṣmaṇa was devoted to Rāma, right from the cradle.[^3]

[^2]:  “ahamasyāvaro bhrātā guṇair dāsyaṃ upāgataḥ”.

And in the above context, Lakṣmaṇa merely adduced yet another consideration for his constant attendance on Rāma. Service unto the Lord by virtue of the essentialnature of the individual soul (Śeṣatva), not conditioned by any extraneous consideration or inducements is, no doubt, of primary importance and all else is relegated to a secondary place. At the same time, it has to be noted that the Lord and His excellence can never remain apart. Felicitating Sītā on her fidelity to her husband (giving up the Palace and all its wealth and relatives and following Rāma into exile), Anasūyā Dēvī, wife of Sage Atri, exhorted that the husband needs to be venerated as God Himself, be he in town or wood, well or ill. Swayed by modesty, the bashful Sītā stood with down-cast eyes and spoke out: “My love for Rāma is spontaneous and yet, people are likely to construe that I love him because of his excellence, both physical and mental. It is indeed difficult for me to prove that my fidelity to Rāma has no strings attached to it and stands by itself without any external provocation or inducements, as Rāma and his excellence can never remain apart. My fidelity will remain constant even if he were the exact reverse of what he is”.

[^3]:  bālyāt prabrti susnigdha.

The philosophy of ‘Tattva’ (truth), ‘Hita’ (Path) and ‘Puruṣārtha’(goal), elucidated in this work, is presented in a summarised form, in the opening stanza itself, by indicating that ‘Tirumāl’ (Mahāviṣṇu) is the Supreme Lord, worshipping His lustrous feet, the Supreme path, and attainment of those very feet, through His redemptive grace, the highest goal. What a grand start, going straight to the subject on hand! Of the five-fold manifestations of God, namely, ‘Para’, Vyūha’, ‘Vibhava’, ‘Antaryāmi’ and Arcā this decad deals with the ‘Para’ or the transcendental Form of the Lord and the cognate activities.[^4]


[^4]:  Actually, the first two decads of this great work embrace all that has been said in all the four cantos of the ‘Brahma Sūtras’, (the Mīmāṃsaka Śāstra [mīmāṃsāśāstra], already referred to in the Introduction), elucidated in Śrī Rāmānuja’s Śrī Bhāṣya. The first six songs of the first decad cover the first Adhyāya of the Brahma sūtras, the next five songs of that decad convey the contents of the second Adhyāya of the Sūtras, the first eight songs of the second decad (Viṭumiṉ) embrace the third Adhyāya of the sūtras and the next three songs of that decad summarise the fourth and the last canto of the Sūtras. Again, decads three to hundred of Tiruvāymoḻi only elaborate what is already set out in the first two decads.







## 1.1.1
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அயர்வு அறும் அமரர்கள் அதிபதி எவன் அவன்

**English translation of verse 1.1.1:**

My mind, lift yourself up to the dazzling, *distress-dispelling* feet of the One, who is the Lord of the ever alert *Eternal Heroes*, who is the natural repository of super-excellent traits which cut out all fatigue, and who unto me vouchsafed *wisdom-love*, ridding me of *ignorance*, leaving no trace of it behind.

**Notes**

\(i\) *Distress-dispelling feet*: Tradition has it that this has a pointed reference to the comely feet of Lord Devarāja, enshrined in Śrī Hasti Śailam (Kāñcīpuram). Whereas all the other Ācāryas before Śrī Rāmānuja interpreted this phrase as “The feet that relieve the distress of the yearning votaries”, Śrī Rāmānuja held that the Lord’s feet relieve His own erstwhile distress over the sad plight of His subjects, sunk deep in the miserable mire of ‘Saṃsāra’, the dreadful cycle of birth and death, after relieving the distress of the latter.

\(ii\) *Eternal Heroes*: The ‘Nitya Sūrīs’, Ananta, Garuḍa, Viṣvaksena and other celestials, ever alert in the Lord’s intimate service in Yonder Heavens, and ever free, in the sense that they never passed through the gruelling mill of ‘Saṃsāra’ the cycle of birth and death.

\(iii\) ‘*Matinalam*’ in the original text means ‘wisdom-love’ which can be expanded as follows:

> (*a*) God granted me ‘wisdom’ as well as ‘love’.[^1]
>
> (*b*) The second interpretation ascribed to Śrī Parāśara Bhaṭṭar is:
> “God gave me loving wisdom or wisdom partaking of the nature of love
> to God, vigorous from the very root like the ‘*Karuṅkāli*’ (a heavy
> wood—*Acasia catechu*). Whereas, in the case of others, love of God is
> a growth from acts of virtue, in the case of the Āḻvārs, such love was
> induced in them by God’s spontaneous grace, and love to God, in this
> context, is none other than the heart and mind, perfectly blended and
> attuned to the loving service of God.
>
> (*c*) Queried whether Nammāḻvār was one characterised by love to God
> (bhakti) or characterised by surrender to the will of God (prapatti),
> the great preceptor, Empār, replied that the saint had surrendered his
> will entirely to God and that love to God, in his case, was merely a
> habit by which he sustained himself, very different from the
> generality of us, who, while ostensibly resigned to His will, seek
> employment, too, for obtaining food, etc. In the Saint’s case, Lord
> Kṛṣṇa was unto him everything—food, drink and every other luxury.

[^1]:  Bhakti rūpāpanna Jñāna or intellectual love of God.

\(iv\) *Rid of ignorance*: Clear-cut knowledge, absolutely free from non-apprehension (*ajñāna*) or the error of mistaking the body for the soul, wrong apprehension (*anyatha-jñāna*) or the error of owing allegiance to other than the Supreme Lord (minor deities) and ‘*viparita-jñāna*’ (mis-apprehension or inverted apprehension), the error of thinking that the individual soul is the independent master and can enjoy itself (like the *kaivalya* class) whereas it is the sole servitor of the Lord, in whom vests the inviolable right to enjoy the former—such blemishless knowledge was dowered on the saint by the Lord’s free Grace—an act of Grace galore!





## 1.1.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மனன்அகம் மலம் அற மலர்மிசை எழுதரும்  
மனன் உணர்வு அளவு இலன், பொறி உணர்வு அவை இலன்  
இனன் உணர், முழு நலம், எதிர் நிகழ் கழிவினும்

iṉaṉ uṇar, muḻu nalam, etir nikaḻ kaḻiviṉum  
iṉaṉ ilaṉ eṉaṉ uyir, mikunarai ilaṉē.

**English translation of verse 1.1.2:**

The Supreme Lord, peerless at all times, past, present and future, the embodiment of bliss and knowledge in their perfection, much beyond the grasp of the senses, cutside the ken of comprehension of even the thoroughly cleansed mind of the Yogi, He is my good soul. O my mind, lift yourself up to the dazzling, distress-dispelling feet of such a Great One.

**Notes**

\(i\) In the first stanza, it was said that there was none above the Lord. The doubt might, however, arise whether He has any equal and now it is declared that He has no equal either.

\(ii\) It might sound strange that the Lord is beyond the comprehension of even the ‘Yogi with a thoroughly cleansed mind; the fact is, even he can comprehend Him only as infinite and immeasurable, free from the limiting adjuncts of the other two entities (Tattvas), namely, ‘Jiva’ (individual soul or ‘cit’, that which perceives) and matter (‘acit’, that which does not perceive).




## 1.1.3
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

இலன் அது உடையன் இது என நினைவு அரியவன்  
நிலனிடை விசும்பிடை உருவினன் அருவினன்  
புலனொடு புலன் அலன், ஒழிவு இலன் பரந்த அந்-  
நலன் உடை ஒருவனை நணுகினம் நாமே.

ilaṉ atu uṭaiyaṉ itu eṉa niṉaivu ariyavaṉ

pulaṉoṭu pulaṉ alaṉ, oḻivu ilaṉ paranta an-  
nalaṉ uṭai oruvaṉai naṇukiṉam nāmē.

**English translation of verse 1.1.3:**

Could He be said to possess that one and not this other thing? No, He pervades, without intermission, the entire Universe, the region high up as well as those below the earth at all times; He abides in all non-sentient things (matter), having form and size as well as the formless sentient beings within them all (individual souls), and He is yet beyond the grasp of the senses. Blessed are we to have attained Him of peerless glory!

**Notes**

\(i\) The Lord was revealed in the first stanza, in His transcendental glory in the High Heavens and He is now described as the all-pervasive Internal Controller, dwelling in the heart of every one, even on this side of heaven, the land of dark nescience, for the sustenance of His ‘*līlā-vibhūti*’ or the sportive universe.

\(ii\) Notwithstanding the king’s sovereignty over the entire land, he and his royal consorts lovingly raise orchards and flower gardens as a matter of recreation, and tend them with special care. The sportive universe (*līlā vibhūti*) is a similar creation of the Lord, raised and retained at His volition.




## 1.1.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நாம் அவன் இவன் உவன், அவள் இவள் உவள் எவள்  
தாம் அவர் இவர் உவர், அது இது உது எது  
வீமவை இவை உவை, அவை நலம், தீங்கு அவை  
ஆமவை ஆயவை ஆய் நின்ற அவரே.

nām avaṉ ivaṉ uvaṉ, avaḷ ivaḷ uvaḷ evaḷ  
tām avar ivar uvar, atu itu utu etu  
vīmavai ivai uvai, avai nalam, tīṅku avai  
āmavai āyavai āy niṉṟa avarē.

**English translation of verse 1.1.4:**

We, the masculine beings over here, as well as those at a distance, near at hand and in between, the feminine species similarly situated, all things collectively seen here, there and everywhere, what can be individually pointed out as this, that and the other, the non-sentient things, good, bad, perishable and imperishable, things that were, are and will be, all these subsist in Him. (In other words, all these are sustained, directed and controlled by him).




## 1.1.5
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அவரவர் தமதமது அறிவு அறி வகைவகை  
அவரவர் இறையவர் என அடி அடைவர்கள்  
அவரவர் இறையவர் குறைவு இலர் இறையவர்  
அவரவர் விதிவழி அடைய நின்றனரே.

avaravar tamatamatu aṟivu aṟi vakaivakai  
avaravar iṟaiyavar eṉa aṭi aṭaivarkaḷ  
avaravar iṟaiyavar kuṟaivu ilar iṟaiyavar  
avaravar vitivaḻi aṭaiya niṉṟaṉarē.

**English translation of verse 1.1.5:**

Different grades of people, with varying degrees of spiritual knowledge and calibre, seek favours from minor deities (*Agni*, *Indra* etc.) whom they propitiate as their God. If those deities, in turn, bestow the boons sought by their votaries, to the extent deserved by them, it is *only through the grace of the Supreme Lord, (Śrīman Nārāyaṇa*) who stays inside these deities (as their internal *controller*) and maintains them.

**Notes**

\(i\) The śāstras proclaim that the Supreme Lord (puruṣōttama) alone is the granter of all felicities and destroyer of all evils.[^1]

\(ii\) But for the influx of the requisite power from the Supreme Lord, which maintains the minor deities in their respective positions of authority, the minor deities, by themselves, would be incapable of extending favours to their votaries and vouch-safing protection to them; if they did, all by themselves, it would indeed be just as miraculous as the earthen elephants and horses, stationed in battle array, in the precincts of the petty pagodas of demi-gods (*Śāsthā*), on the outskirts of villages and towns, actually going to battle—a veritable impossibility!

[^1]:  “na sampadam samāhare vibhatām vinivartane, samartho dhriśyate kaścit tam vinā puruottamaṃ.”





## 1.1.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நின்றனர் இருந்தனர் கிடந்தனர் திரிந்தனர்  
நின்றிலர் இருந்திலர் கிடந்திலர் திரிந்திலர்  
என்றும் ஓர் இயல்வினர் என நினைவு அரியவர்  
என்றும் ஓர் இயல்வொடு நின்ற எம் திடரே.

niṉṟaṉar iruntaṉar kiṭantaṉar tirintaṉar  
niṉṟilar iruntilar kiṭantilar tirintilar  
eṉṟum ōr iyalviṉar eṉa niṉaivu ariyavar  
eṉṟum ōr iyalvoṭu niṉṟa em tiṭarē.

**English translation of verse 1.1.6:**

We have it on the firm authority of the Vedas, that it is our Supreme Lord, who controls and sustains the different postures of standing, sitting, lying and wandering about, of one and all, as well as their abstinance therefrom, Himself being immutable (undergoing no change whatsoever) and yet beyond specific scrutiny and comprehension.

**Notes**

\(i\) In stanzas 4 and 5, the Supreme Lord was shown to be the Sole Architect and Sustainer of the created world of differences (*līlā vibhūti*) and now, in this stanza, He is declared to be the cause of motion as well as rest—‘*pravṛtti*’ as well as ‘*nivṛtti*’.

\(ii\) To a poser whether God, on Whom all our actions or motions are said to be dependent, is again required to bring our activity to rest, Empār replied in the affirmative and brought home the point by citing the example of sage Viśvāmitra, who had pushed King ‘Triśaṅku’, bodily, on to *Svarga*, arresting his fall therefrom and making him stay mid-way in the process.




## 1.1.7
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

திட விசும்பு எரி வளி நீர் நிலம் இவைமிசைப்  
படர் பொருள் முழுவதும் ஆய் அவைஅவைதொறும்  
உடல்மிசை உயிர் எனக் கரந்து எங்கும் பரந்துளன்  
சுடர் மிகு சுருதியுள் இவை உண்ட சுரனே.

uṭalmicai uyir eṉak karantu eṅkum parantuḷaṉ  
cuṭar miku curutiyuḷ ivai uṇṭa curaṉē.

**English translation of verse 1.1.7:**

The Supreme Lord, enshrined in the shining śruti (scriptures—Vedas) is the Material cause of the basic elements of ‘*ākāśa*’ (ether), air, fire, water and earth, which combined to usher in the worlds, with a vast variety of colours and forms; He pervades them all, in and out, like unto the soul inside the body and remains invisible; He contains them all inside His stomach (during the period of deluge).

**Note**

The preceding stanzas, which declare that God is all-in-all, might smack of monistic philosophy, making it out that God is the one and only entity from whom all things emanated, which are thus merely His manifestations. Now it is clarified that the Lord is apart from the non-sentient things and sentient beings and enters them all as ‘Antaryāmin’ (Internal Controller), like unto the soul inside the body, an enunciation based on no less than the authority of the scintillating Vedas. (*Herein lies the key to the Viśiṣṭādvaita philosophy*).




## 1.1.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

சுரர் அறிவு அரு நிலை விண் முதல் முழுவதும்  
வரன் முதலாய் அவை முழுது உண்ட பரபரன்  
புரம் ஒரு மூன்று எரித்து அமரர்க்கும் அறிவியந்து  
அரன் அயன் என உலகு அழித்து அமைத்து உளனே.

curar aṟivu aru nilai viṇ mutal muḻuvatum

puram oru mūṉṟu erittu amararkkum aṟiviyantu  
araṉ ayaṉ eṉa ulaku aḻittu amaittu uḷaṉē.

**English translation of verse 1.1.8:**

The Supreme Lord is beyond the comprehension of even Brahmā and other *Curar* (Devas); He is the material cause of the primordial matter, the other elements and all that exist, and safeguards them all inside His Stomach during the period of deluge; He is the one who (functioning through Śiva) destroyed the three unique flying citadels. He is the propagator of knowledge to the *Amarar* (Devas) through Brahmā; He creates the worlds and dissolves them through *Ayaṉ (Brahmā*) and *Araṉ (Śiva*) standing within them (as their Inner Self).

**Note**

It has been made out in the preceding stanzas that (1) Lord Mahāviṣṇu is the Supreme Lord, proclaimed, as such, by the Vedas and (2) He is the Soul of all that exist, controls their creation, sustentation and dissolution. All these might appear to be one-sided, displaying a marked partiality for Mahāviṣṇu, ignoring the claims of the Stalwarts like Brahmā, Rudra and other powerful Devas, who have to their credit several achievements, such as creation of the worlds and dissolution thereof, destruction of the flying citadels of the three tough demons, etc. By way of dispelling the superficial belief and knowledge that Mahāviṣṇu is but a co-functionary, on a par with Brahmā and Rudra, that Mahāviṣṇu has the limited function of sustentation only, while the other two are the sole monarchs of their respective fields of creation and dissolution, it is now stated that all the three functions vest in Mahāviṣṇu alone, who gets them discharged through the appropriate authority. Śvetāśvatāropaniṣad clarifies that Brahmā emerged from the lotus flower that blossomed on the stalk sprouting from Mahāviṣṇu’s navel and was imparted by Him, the requisite knowledge of the Vēdas to carry on the work of creation and disseminate the Vēdas to others. As regards the function of dissolution, Rudra and Yama have their own limitations which Mahāviṣṇu transcends as their Inner Self, sustaining, directing and controlling them all.




## 1.1.9
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

உளன் எனில் உளன் அவன் உருவம் இவ் உருவுகள்  
உளன் அலன் எனில், அவன் அருவம் இவ் அருவுகள்  
உளன் என இலன் என இவை குணம் உடைமையில்  
உளன் இரு தகைமையொடு ஒழிவு இலன் பரந்தே.

uḷaṉ eṉa ilaṉ eṉa ivai kuṇam uṭaimaiyil  
uḷaṉ iru takaimaiyoṭu oḻivu ilaṉ parantē.

**English translation of verse 1.1.9:**

Be it said (as *the theists say*), “He is,” or (as the *atheists say*) “He is not”, (both ways) His existence is established. He exists, at all times and in all places together with the aggregate of the formless sentient beings and the non-sentient things with shape and size, both in the gross state (embodied and therefore visible) and in the subtle state (disembodied and therefore objectively imperceptible).

**Notes**

\(i\) The theists (Vaidikas) are those; who subscribe to the authority of the Vēdas;

\(ii\) The atheists (Nāstikas) are those who deny the existence of God. Denial can and ought to be only with respect to a thing, which forms the subject of such denial. That thing should be there, at least notionally, as ‘nothing’, as such, does not warrant denial, rather needs no denial. Thus, this stanza cuts across the exponents of ‘Śunya Vāda’ or the doctrine of nothingness. The Upaniṣadic text ‘*asat vā idamagra āsīth*’ refers to the invisible subtle state (too subtle to be visible), when this world which forms Brahman’s body was gradually reabsorbed into Brahman, each constituent element being refunded into its immediate cause. The word ‘asat’ italicized in the text, does not connote a state of nothingness or non-existence but the ‘subtle’ state as distinguished from the gross or visible, manifest state.




## 1.1.10
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

பரந்த தண் பரவையுள் நீர்தொறும் பரந்துளன்  
பரந்த அண்டம் இது என: நிலம் விசும்பு ஒழிவு அறக்  
கரந்த சில் இடந்தொறும் இடம் திகழ் பொருள்தொறும்

karantu eṅkum parantuḷaṉ: ivai uṇṭa karaṉē.

**English translation of verse 1.1.10:**

The Lord pervades every little bit of the oceanic waters, cool and sprawling (and yet does not feel cramped but, on the other hand), He feels as easy there as in the expansive world outside. Either on earth or the upper regions (in the whole universe) there is no place where He is not immanent, dwelling, as He does secretly, in the heart of all things and being however minute, and in all places (imperceptible to the things and beings pervaded by Him ever firm and eternal). He is the Lord, who contains them all within Himself, during the period of deluge (in the state of dissolution).

**Notes**

\(i\) The Individual Soul, of the size of a minute speck, pervades the body it gets into, only by dint of its attributive consciousness; in the very nature of things, it cannot be co-extensive and co-expansive with the body it occupies, like God, who is omnipresent, not being conditioned by any limiting adjuncts of the other two entities, namely, spirit (Jiva) and matter.

\(ii\) The doubt as to how the Lord can pervade the inside out of the Individual Soul, of the size of a mere speck (subatomic) gets automatically resolved, seeing that the Lord, in but a juvenile form, contains all the worlds during the period of deluge—if the golden stomach, which devoured all the butter stored up by the damsels in the pastoral village of Gokul, could contain within it all the worlds as well, why should one doubt the Lord’s power of pervasion of the minutest of things, both in and out?




## 1.1.11
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கர விசும்பு எரி வளி நீர் நிலம் இவைமிசை  
வரன் நவில் திறல் வலி அளி பொறை ஆய்நின்ற  
பரன் அடிமேல் குருகூர்ச் சடகோபன் சொல்

**English translation of verse 1.1.10:**

The foregoing ten stanzas, out of the thousand, rich alike in sound and substance (matter and manner of expression), sung by Caṭakōpaṉ of Kurukūr, in adoration of the Glorious Feet of the Supreme Lord, the great Contriver and Controller of the five elements, the spatial ether, air, fire, water and earth, with their respective basic qualities of sound, force, heat, chillness and endurance, shall lead (the chanters on) to ‘Mōkṣa’ (final emancipation from the bondage of ‘Saṃsāra’, the terrific cycle of birth and death).

**Notes**

\(i\) This sets the pattern of the entire work, the last stanza of each decad indicating the benefits accruing to one who chants the songs in the decad and/or learns the meanings thereof. One might wonder how the Saint could refer to the size of the work, as comprising, thousand stanzas right at the start. Well, there are two ways of looking at it, namely,

> (*a*) as one whose knowledge was fully inspired by God, he knew that
> he would reel off a thousand stanzas; and
>
> (*b*) the poet could not sustain himself except by singing a thousand
> songs in adoration of the Lord, and thus it was a matter already
> contemplated by him, a resolution, as it were, to sing as many songs.

\(ii\) Summing up, in this stanza, the decad as a whole, the Saint has made it abundantly clear that our salvation lies in seeking refuge at the Lord’s Feet, the path of loving surrender to God being the central theme of the whole work, otherwise known as ‘*Dīrgha Śaraṇāgati*’. Actually, the first decad is the epitome of the entire hymnal, even as the first three stanzas of this, decad sum up the topic of the whole decad while the-first stanza is the quintessence of the first three stanzas and the opening Jine of the first stanza, the; brilliant summary thereof.
