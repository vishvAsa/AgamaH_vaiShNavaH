## 00 Intro3.7
Despite his earlier disappointments, it was his extraordinary fellow-feeling that egged the Āḻvār on, to address the worldlings once more, as in the last decad, pretty sure of bringing them round. Even the amazing simplicity of the Lord in His ‘Arcā’ manifestation, the sure plank, according to the Āḻvār, for weaning them, made no visible impact on the unfortunate fellows wallowing in the sty of worldly life, much to the chagrin of the Āḻvār. The Āḻvār, however, drowns his disappointment, in this decad in the blissful contemplation of service unto the Lord’s devotees, the logical conclusion of service unto the Lord, in keeping with the essential nature of the Individual soul.

In ‘Periya Tirumoḻi’ (8-10-3), Tirumaṅkai Āḻvār has declared that, as a result of learning the eight-lettered ‘Tirumantra’, he became a vassal of the devotees of the Lord, enshrined in Tirukkaṇṇapuram. Service unto the Lord’s devotees, as well, is implied in the middle part of ‘Tirumantra’, viz, ‘namaḥ’. It is held by some that service unto the Lord’s devotees is implicit in letter *A* of ‘Praṇava’ (Aum), with its discarded dative caseending, which brings into focus the soul’s dependence on the Lord; others say that the middle letter *U* of ‘Praṇava’ emphasises the exclusive dependence of the soul on the Lord and that the farthest point upto which dependence on the Lord could go, by virtue of His unbounded love for His devotees, would be the individual soul’s utter devotion to those devotees as well. This is readily borne out by our common experience in the world of human affairs also. It, however, matters not whether this particular meaning goes with the word ‘namaḥ’ or letter ‘A’ or letter ‘U’ of the Praṇava (AUM). All the same, our great preceptors have thought it fit to link this concept with the word ‘namaḥ’ which helps to discard the rags of ‘I-ness’ and ‘My-ness’, enveloping and disfiguring the individual soul.

Śatrugna provided the shining example of unflinching service marked by extraordinary devotion to Bharata, a great devotee of Śrī Rāma. Soon after the marriage of the four Princes, in Mithilā, Bharata had an invitation from his uncle, king Yudājit of Kekaya (perhaps, modern Greece) to go with him to that country. Bharata set out on the said journey, on an auspicious day, appropriate to his birth star. The inseparable Śatrugna also accompanied Bharata, out of his dutiful love for the latter, although the former had no invitation, as such, from King Yudājit nor did the day of the commencement of the journey suit his (Śatrugna’s) birth star. According to Śatrugna whose devotion to Bharata was of such a high order, there was hardly any need for all these, as he considered himself no mo re than a part and parcel of Bharata and not as a separate entity.

**Tamil text and transliteration:**

பயிலும் சுடர் ஒளி மூர்த்தியை பங்கயக் கண்ணனை,  
பயில இனிய நம் பாற்கடல் சேர்ந்த பரமனை,  
பயிலும் திரு உடையார் எவரேலும் அவர் கண்டீர்,

payilum tiru uṭaiyār evarēlum avar kaṇṭīr,  
payilum piṟappiṭai tōṟu emmai āḷum paramarē. (2)

**English translation of verse 3.7.1:**

They that are with eternal wealth of God -love endowed  
Whatever be their descent, meditating on our Lord Supreme  
Resting on the milk-ocean, the lotus-eyed, of a form  
Of solid splendour and mounting sweetness, shall hold  
Me as their vassal, in all the births to come.

**Notes**

\(i\) The Āḻvār says that all those who are steeped in the enjoyment of the Supreme Lord’s auspicious traits and enthralling form, are his masters, irrespective of their parentage. These devotees have now been accorded by the Āḻvār the position of eminence attributed earlier to the Supreme Lord alone.

\(ii\) *The lotus-eyed*: This special feature proclaims the Lord’s transcendent glory (paratva). It is indeed a form of supernal splendour that the Lord assumes, during His avatāras, so as to enthral His subjects; even if such an exquisite form fails to attract them, His lotus-eyes will do the job—the folks cannot but be entrapped by His bewitching eyes.

\(iii\) *Mounting sweetness*: Unlike the ephemeral pleasures of the world, which are alluring from a distance but prove disappointing at close quarters, the Lord, with His enchanting looks and enthralling form and a disposition of mounting sweetness, is an inexhaustible fountain of bliss.

\(iv\) *Eternal wealth of God-Love*: Those who employ the Lord as the ‘Means’ for achieving their personal ends, would drift from Him, once their ends are achieved. On the other hand, those that seek Him for His own sake, as their ‘Be-all’ and ‘End-All’, will stick unto Him for ever and there is no risk whatsoever of their getting parted from Him. Service unto the Lord, as an end in itself, is the eternal wealth referred to there. Take the case of Lakṣmaṇa who, at his volition, accompanied Śrī Rāma into exile. What wealth did the youngster carry with him? With but a spade and basket in hand, the insignia of his incessant toil in his unremitting service unto the Divine Couple, he is glorified as ‘*Lakṣmaṇo Lakṣmī sampannaḥ*’. Again, literaḷḷy hounded out by Rāvaṇa, Vibhīṣaṇa, still anchored in mid-air, sought asylum in Rāma’s camp. Vībhiṣaṇa’s admission into Rāma’s camp was hotly debated and, in this unenviable position, when Vibhīṣaṇa was neither here nor there, he was referred to, as ‘*antarikṣagatas śrīmān*’. What was the wealth in him then to be called ‘Śrīmān’ (the wealthy)? It was his robust conviction that he shall not get back to the evil-minded Rākṣasas, even if he were to be denied admission in Rāma’s camp! And then, Gajendra, the elephant, in dire distress, was referred to as ‘*Satu nāgavaraś Śrīmān*’, the wealth, in this case, being the elephant’s singleminded devotion to the Lord, utterly unmindful of his own grim struggle with the crocodile. The elephant’s one and only objective was to offer the lotus flower in his trunk to the Lord, while it was still fresh. It is such singleminded devotion to the Lord that is real wealth, everlasting.

Deeply grieved over his separation from Śrī Rāma, during the long years of the latter’s exile, Bharata would say that his grief would vanish only when Rāma wore the regal crown (as Śeṣi—Master) and he wore, the *crown of service unto Him* (as Śeṣa—the servant).

‘*Whatever be their descent*’: Here, it may be added, whatever be the extent of their learning, manner of occupation etc.

‘*In the births to come*’: Here, the Āḻvār declares that he is the vassal of the Lord’s devotees, rather than of the Lord. The Āḻvār who had earlier blamed the Lord for taking him through a gruesome succession of births, would now willingly court any number of future births out of sheer love of serving the Lord’s devotees in all those births.




## 3.7.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஆளும் பரமனை கண்ணனை ஆழிப் பிரான் தன்னை,  
தோளும் ஓர் நான்கு உடைத் தூமணி வண்ணன் எம்மான்தன்னை  
தாளும் தடக் கையும் கூப்பிப் பணியும் அவர் கண்டீர்,  
நாளும் பிறப்பிடைதோறு எம்மை ஆளுடை நாதரே.

āḷum paramaṉai kaṇṇaṉai āḻip pirāṉ taṉṉai,  
tōḷum ōr nāṉku uṭait tūmaṇi vaṇṇaṉ emmāṉtaṉṉai  
tāḷum taṭak kaiyum kūppip paṇiyum avar kaṇṭīr,  
nāḷum piṟappiṭaitōṟu emmai āḷuṭai nātarē.

**English translation of verse 3.7.2:**

They are the Masters that enslave me daily and life after life,  
Who do with joined palms and legs, prostrate  
Unto Kaṇṇaṉ, the Lord Supreme, the Benefactor great,  
Holding the discus, of the hue of blue gem immaculate,  
With peerless shoulders four, the reigning Chief.

**Notes**

\(i\) The Āḻvār affirms that those that are swayed by the Lord’s exquisite charm, in all its details, are his perennial masters.

\(ii\) *Reigning Chief*: If the Lord’s devotees are the Āḻvār’s masters, how could the Lord be called the reigning Chief? This *prima facie* contradiction is resolved by holding that the Lord’s reign over His subjects is directed towards reclaiming them and enlisting them in the service of His devotees. Right in the opening line of the first of his ten scintillating stanzas, Tiruppāṇ Āḻvār depicts this special feature of the Lord.

\(iii\) *Lord Kaṇṇaṉ*: By His devoted service unto His elder brother Balarāma, a reincarnation of Ādiśeṣa, Śrī Kṛṣṇa has demonstrated the importance of service unto devotees.

\(iv\) *The Shoulders four*: The Lord doles out the four ‘Puruṣārtas’, the ultimate values, as elected by the votaries, with His four arms, one for each. Once, when Śrī Parāśara Bhaṭṭar happened to be in Tirukkōṭṭiyūr, he was asked by Anantāḻvāṉ whether the Lord is seen in His Celestium (Heaven-Parama pada) with two arms or four arms. Bhaṭṭārya replied that the ‘Ekāyanas’ (Madhvās) hold that the Lord has only two arms while others say four. In the temple at Śrīraṅgam, the stationary image of Lord Raṅganātha, reclining on the Serpent-bed, in the Sanctum Sanctorum (Known as Periya Perumāḷ) is seen by us, with the naked eye, as having only two arms while those, with spiritual vision, see four arms and even more. Tirupppāṇāḻvār has seen Lord Raṅganātha with four arms, as set forth in his hymns (Amalaṉātipirāṉ-7). Maṇḍodari, wife of Rāvaṇa, saw the ultra-mundane form in Śrī Rāma, standing beside her fallen husband and described the former as the one beyond matter, the Sustainer, wielding the Conch, Discus and Mace. Śrī Rāma was generally seen only with two arms; Hanumān, however, alluded to many aims (*bhāhavaḥ*, Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa IV-3-14). Kṛṣṇa was seen by Vasudeva and Devakī, with four arms, right at birth, and He concealed the two extra arms, as desired by His revered father. And then, on the battlefield at Kurukṣetra, Arjuna prayed that he be allowed to see Kṛṣṇa back again with four arms instead of the thousands of arms he saw in His universal Form (Viśvarūpa) a little while ago (Bhagavad Gīṭā XI-46). In Rāmāyaṇa, Uttara Kāṇḍa 8-26, Sage Agastya addressed Śrī Rāma, as. “Thou art Nārāyaṇa, the ancient, the four-armed”. Nevertheless, one need not make a fetish of this, as four-handedness need not necessarily be a special sign of Divinity to wrest allegiance from mankind. (It is learnt that a four-handed human form is kept embalmed in Fyzabad museum near Ayodhyā. Would it become worthy of worship? No, not at all.)

\(v\) *Prostrate with joined legs and palms:*

‘*Joined legs*’ indicate immobility, ‘*ananyagatitva*’, or non-dependence on others—‘nowhere else to go’, in plain language.

‘*Joined palms*’ devote ‘*Ākiñcanya*’ or absence of any merit in the supplicant, attracting the Lord’s grace; in other words, it is only the Lord’s ‘*nirhetuka kṛpā*’, spontaneous or gratuitous grace that can deliver the goods.




## 3.7.3
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நாதனை ஞாலமும் வானமும் ஏத்தும் நறும் துழாய்ப்  
போதனை பொன் நெடும் சக்கரத்து எந்தை பிரான் தன்னை  
பாதம் பணிய வல்லாரைப் பணியும் அவர் கண்டீர்,  
ஓதும் பிறப்பிடைதோறு எம்மை ஆளுடையார்களே.

nātaṉai ñālamum vāṉamum ēttum naṟum tuḻāyp  
pōtaṉai poṉ neṭum cakkarattu entai pirāṉ taṉṉai  
pātam paṇiya vallāraip paṇiyum avar kaṇṭīr,  
ōtum piṟappiṭaitōṟu emmai āḷuṭaiyārkaḷē.

**English translation of verse 3.7.3:**

Birth after birth, they my masters shall be,  
Who prostrate at the feet of my Liege-Lord,  
Holding the golden Discus grand and wearing a garland of tuḷaci  
Of fragrance sweet, by those in Heaven and Earth adored.

**Notes**

\(i\) The Āḻvār declares that those God-lovers, who are lost in enjoyment of the Lord’s sinewy shoulders and the lovely tuḷaci garland adorning them, are his perpetual masters.

As a matter of fact, this fascinating combination of shoulder and garland attracts the denizens of Heaven and Earth alike. Even those who are out to denigrate Godhead, get enthralled by the charming tuḷaci garland on the Divine person. Where even the tuḷaci garland fails to work, the effulgent Discus, held attractively by the Lord, has an irresistible appeal.

\(ii\) The following anecdote will show how difficult it is for us to bring ourselves to adore men who, for all outward appearances, are just like other men, the common run, eating and sleeping. To discover saintliness lying hidden in the Saints, calls for more than ordinary ken of perception in the on-looker.

Śrī Piḷḷai Āttāṉ, occupant of a spiritual gadi, in apostolic succession, sought from the great Nañcīyar, instructions in ‘Dramiḍopaniṣad’ (Tiruvāymoḻi). His Holiness, however, politely suggested that Śrī Āttāṉ could as well go to Nampiḷḷai (Nañcīyar’s disciple) and enjoy a sumptuous repast at his hands. Śrī Attāṉ, however, demurred, on the ground that he may have to prostrate unto Nampiḷḷai in that case. Nañcīyar put Śrī Āttāṉ at ease, by sending for Nampiḷḷai and ordering him to give Śrī Attāṉ a course of instructions without subjecting the latter to ceremonious formalities. And so, the instructions went on, but when the present decad stressing the importance of veneration of Godly men even more than God, came up, Śrī Āttāṉ turned penitent and begged of Nampiḷḷai that he (Attāṉ) be treated thenceforward as a humble disciple and permitted to make due obeisance to the learned instructor. But Nampiḷḷai declined to act otherwise than as commanded earlier by his Master (Nañcīyar) and would not, therefore, be a party to this change-over on the part of Śrī Attāṉ. The remorseful Āttāṉ sought the intervention of Nañcīyar and submitted that he (Attāṉ) be treated thenceforward as a humble disciple, now that he has come to know of the worthiness of Godly men, the living Saints.

There is yet another anecdote to illustrate that brotherhood among men is a virtue higher than even Fatherhood of God. Two favourite disciples of Nañcīyar, Vīrappiḷḷai and Pālikai vāḷippiḷḷai, once set out on a travel on friendly terms. But when some misunderstanding arose between them they gave up talking to each other.

When Nañcīyar came to know of this, he admonished them, saying:

> “My Sons! It is difficult to comprehend one brother being offended
> against another. It only shows that wealth and lust, the cause of hate
> and anger, have not been eschewed yet or things of God have not been
> felt of great worth”.

This reprimand made them feel truly repentant and restored their former amity.




## 3.7.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

உடை ஆர்ந்த ஆடையன் கண்டிகையன் உடை நாணினன்  
புடை ஆர் பொன் நூலினன் பொன் முடியன் மற்றும் பல்கலன்,  
நடையா உடைத் திருநாரணன் தொண்டர் தொண்டர் கண்டீர்,  
இடை ஆர் பிறப்பிடைதோறு எமக்கு எம் பெருமக்களே.

uṭai ārnta āṭaiyaṉ kaṇṭikaiyaṉ uṭai nāṇiṉaṉ  
puṭai ār poṉ nūliṉaṉ poṉ muṭiyaṉ maṟṟum palkalaṉ,  
naṭaiyā uṭait tirunāraṇaṉ toṇṭar toṇṭar kaṇṭīr,  
iṭai ār piṟappiṭaitōṟu emakku em perumakkaḷē.

**English translation of verse 3.7.4:**

In every birth, without exception, they are unto us  
Far superior indeed, the vassals of the vassals  
Of Tiru Nāraṇaṉ, of charm exquisite, smartly clad  
And adorned by many a jewel, the waist band gold,  
Necklace, Sacred thread, the crown delectable  
And many more, unto Him befitting and natural.

**Note**

Here the Āḻvār avers that the vassals of the vassals of the Lord, lost in admiration of His natural beauty, imparting special lustre to the numerous jewels on His person, each one of which, from head to foot, steals the hearts of the beholders, are any day superior to him not only in this birth but in all future births also.




## 3.7.5
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

பெருமக்கள் உள்ளவர் தம் பெருமானை, அமரர்கட்கு  
அருமை ஒழிய அன்று ஆர் அமுது ஊட்டிய அப்பனை,  
பெருமை பிதற்ற வல்லாரைப் பிதற்றும் அவர் கண்டீர்,  
வருமையும் இம்மையும் நம்மை அளிக்கும் பிராக்களே.

perumakkaḷ uḷḷavar tam perumāṉai, amararkaṭku  
arumai oḻiya aṉṟu ār amutu ūṭṭiya appaṉai,  
perumai pitaṟṟa vallāraip pitaṟṟum avar kaṇṭīr,  
varumaiyum immaiyum nammai aḷikkum pirākkaḷē.

**English translation of verse 3.7.5:**

They that do with ecstatic incoherence utter  
The glory great of the Sire who once fed in full  
The Devas with ambrosia, Chief of the exalted Celestials.  
Are indeed our saviours grand, both here and hereafter.

**Notes**

\(i\) *Chief of the exaḻted Celestials*: The *Nityasūris* (ever free angels in heaven) stand on a high pedestal of their own and the Lord, as their Chief, is higher than the highest.

\(ii\) The Devas sought from the Lord the ambrosia in order to become deathless. No doubt, the Lord felt very much that the Devas should have been so short-sighted and under-evolved as to seek from Him a mere extract from the ocean instead of straightaway coveting Him, the insatiable Nectar, the inexhaustible fountain of bliss. And yet, it was some consolation for Him that they didn’t seek this favour, inferior though, from any one else. How generous of Him indeed that He took all the trouble to churn the ocean and get them what they wanted! Those that are lost in admiration of the great souls who recognise and adore this act of grace on the part of the Lord, are deemed by the Āḻvār as his benefactors, the masters, who alone can salve him, here and hereafter in this land by keeping him aloof from the Ungodly and, in the yonder heaven, by putting him on to the eternal service of Lord Śrīman Nārāyaṇa.




## 3.7.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அளிக்கும் பரமனை கண்ணனை ஆழிப் பிரான் தன்னை,  
துளிக்கும் நறும் கண்ணித் தூமணி வண்ணன் எம்மான்தன்னை,  
ஒளிக் கொண்ட சோதியை உள்ளத்துக் கொள்ளும் அவர் கண்டீர்,  
சலிப்பு இன்றி ஆண்டு எம்மைச் சன்ம சன்மாந்தரம் காப்பரே.

aḷikkum paramaṉai kaṇṇaṉai āḻip pirāṉ taṉṉai,  
tuḷikkum naṟum kaṇṇit tūmaṇi vaṇṇaṉ emmāṉtaṉṉai,  
oḷik koṇṭa cōtiyai uḷḷattuk koḷḷum avar kaṇṭīr,  
calippu iṉṟi āṇṭu emmaic caṉma caṉmāntaram kāpparē.

**English translation of verse 3.7.6:**

They shall my saviours be and govern  
In all my births, without break, that do enshrine  
In their hearts, Kaṇṇaṉ, the donor superfine,  
Of radiant form, like unto the blue gem immaculate,  
Who does the discus wield and tuḷaci garland sport,  
With fragrance full, shedding honey in plenty.

**Notes**

\(i\) *Donor superfine*: The Lord is not merely the Donor Supreme but also the Donor Superfine in that He gifts Himself away as He did during His Avatāra as Kṛṣṇa.

\(ii\) *The (beneficent) discus*: The Lord would not only give of Himself to His devotees but also give them His extraordinary weapons as He did in the case of King Ambarīṣa. The Lord’s alert discus served as the King’s bodyguard and went in hot pursuit of sage Durvāsa.

\(iii\) No doubt, the Āḻvār courted, in the opening song of this decad, future births, if he could thereby serve the Lord’s devotees without break but now, the protection extended by them unto him, referred to in this song, would be by way of safeguarding him against the pitfalls leading to rebirth.




## 3.7.7
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

சன்ம சன்மாந்தரம் காத்து அடியார்களைக் கொண்டுபோய்,  
தன்மை பெறுத்தித் தன் தாளிணைக்கீழ்க் கொள்ளும் அப்பனை,  
தொன்மை பிதற்ற வல்லாரைப் பிதற்றும் அவர் கண்டீர்,  
நன்மை பெறுத்து எம்மை நாள் உய்யக்கொள்கின்ற நம்பரே.

caṉma caṉmāntaram kāttu aṭiyārkaḷaik koṇṭupōy,  
taṉmai peṟuttit taṉ tāḷiṇaikkīḻk koḷḷum appaṉai,  
toṉmai pitaṟṟa vallāraip pitaṟṟum avar kaṇṭīr,  
naṉmai peṟuttu emmai nāḷ uyyakkoḷkiṉṟa namparē.

**English translation of verse 3.7.7:**

They are, you see. our saviours eternal, we can for our salvation  
Safely depend, that laud in profusion those vociferous  
In the praise of the Lord’s grace spontaneous,  
That cuts out His devotees’ cycle of births and does in them induce  
Knowledge true, so to enlist them in eternal service at His feet in heaven.

**Note**

The Āḻvār has been spot-lighting the Lord’s magnanimity in the last two songs, and he continues to dwell on the Lord’s generosity in this song also, by extolling those lost in admiration of this great trait of the Lord. It is the Lord’s extreme generosity that cuts out an otherwise interminable cycle of births and rebirths through which one’s ethical accounts, hopelessly unbalanced as they are, have to be settled with the ever-increasing risk of losing merit faster than acquiring it.




## 3.7.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நம்பனை ஞாலம் படைத்தவனை திரு மார்பனை,  
உம்பர் உலகினில் யார்க்கும் உணர்வு அரியான் தன்னை,  
கும்பி நரகர்கள் ஏத்துவரேலும் அவர் கண்டீர்,  
எம் பல் பிறப்பிடைதோறு எம் தொழுகுலம் தாங்களே.

nampaṉai ñālam paṭaittavaṉai tiru mārpaṉai,

kumpi narakarkaḷ ēttuvarēlum avar kaṇṭīr,  
em pal piṟappiṭaitōṟu em toḻukulam tāṅkaḷē.

**English translation of verse 3.7.8:**

Even if they be cruel sinners fit for dastardly hell,  
They are the apostles, revered in my births, one and all.  
That sing the glory of the Lord, our haven safe.  
On whose chest ‘Tiru’ (Lakṣmī) does inseparably stay,  
Who did the universe ordain but is beyond the comprehension  
Of one and all, even those in the upper region.

**Note**

The Āḻvār avers that those adoring the blissful conjunction of the Lord and the Divine Mother, are his spiritual mentors for generations, although they might be cruel sinners either fit to be condemned to the dastardly abyss, known as ‘*Kumbhīpāka* [*kumbhīpākam*]’, or even those actually drudging there. This only shows the extreme lengths to which the Āḻvār is prepared to go in his adoration of the Lord’s devotees, and it is, therefore, needless to subject it to closer scrutiny and raise doubts as to how the Āḻvār could see, from where he was, those people serving in the hell and the prospects of those suffering in hell contemplating the glory of the Lord and reciting His names and so on.




## 3.7.9
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

குலம் தாங்கு சாதிகள் நாலிலும் கீழ் இழிந்து, எத்தனை  
நலம் தான் இலாத சண்டாள சண்டாளர்கள் ஆகிலும்,  
வலம் தாங்கு சக்கரத்து அண்ணல் மணிவண்ணற்கு ஆள் என்று உள்

**English translation of verse 3.7.9:**

They are my masters who the vassals are of the vassals  
Of those that, as His loving servitors, do mingle  
With the Lord of sapphire hue, holding the discus bright,  
In right hand, albeit they are born in a down-trodden Caste,  
Worse than the Caṇṭāḷa with little or no repute.

**Notes**

\(i\) The servants of the servants of those devotees, enthralled by the bewitching beauty of the Lord holding the charming discus in hand, are said to be the Āḻvār’s masters, even though the said devotees are otherwise terribly depraved, and worse than the ‘Caṇṭāḷa’, outside the Ken of the four prescribed, time-honoured castes. While devotion to the Lord’s devotees is the Key-note of this song, there is an unfortunate tendency on the part of the superficial modern critics, with a degree of perversion, to go by the letter of the song rather than the underlying spirit. These unrelenting critics question the bonafides of those who reverently chant ‘Tiruvāymoḻi’ and yet do not put into practice the principles, the Ālvār stood for and expounded in his works, e.g. this crucial song.

\(ii\) Stanzas, such as this one, would, however, appear to spot-light the greatness of such highly evolved spiritual personalities as Tirumaḻicai Āḻvār, Tiruppāṇāḻvār, Nampāṭuvāṉ, either born as outcastes or brought up by outcastes, who yet belong to a world of their own and a new denomination known as ‘The clan of God’s servants’, which has nothing to do with the conventional caste-system and classification. Of course, devotion has to be appreciated and adored wherever it is discerned, irrespective of considerations of caste and things of that sort. This love and reference for devotees cannot, however, override the prescribed norms of conduct, appropriate to one’s caste and station in life. This song should not, therefore, be misconstrued as conferring unbridled authority for hammering down and brushing aside the mandates of the Śāstras, as restated by Lord Kṛṣṇa in His ‘Song Celestial’—(Bhagavad Gītā, XVĪ-24).




## 3.7.10
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அடி ஆர்ந்த வையம் உண்டு ஆல் இலை அன்னவசம் செய்யும,

**English translation of verse 3.7.10:**

Vassals we are of the last in the chain  
Of the vassals of the devotees of our Liege-Lord  
Who as mere babe peerless did recline  
On a fig-leaf, holding the seven worlds,  
In His stomach, which earlier He did span.

**Notes**

\(i\) The Āḻvār affirms that he is the vassal unto those that stand last in the chain of the Lord’s devotees, sure and steadfast, lost in admiration of His once spanning all the worlds in just three strides and then sustaining, in His stomach, all the worlds, during the period of deluge.

\(ii\) The worlds devoured by the Lord during the period of deluge are just those measured by Him earlier and thus come up to His feet only, that is, they are no more than the size of His feet.

\(iii\) A mere babe lying on a fig-leaf, floating on the huge expanse of water, containing within its stomach all the world, is indeed a wonderful achievement, beyond imagination, which the Supreme Lord is capable of, the unique blending of the incompatibles. Attracting the Āḻvār by this means, He becomes his Liege-Lord and, in the process, the Āḻvār wants to be at the bottommost rung of His devotees, even as He is the top-most, with none equal to or above Him. (Mukunda-mālā, śloka 27).

\(iv\) Here is an important observation of Nampiḷḷai, which has to be studied in continuation of the notes below stanza 9 of this decad.

> “Even if we are not able to translate into practice this lofty
> sentiment of the Āḻvār for obvious reasons, it will suffice if we
> delightfully contemplate on it and are thus aware that the Āḻvār
> thought on these lines”.

முடிவு, ஆரக் கற்கிற்கில் சன்மம் செய்யாமை முடியுமே. (2)

aṭi ōṅku nūṟṟuvar vīya aṉṟu aivarkku aruḷceyta-  
neṭiyōṉait, teṉ kurukūrc caṭakōpaṉ kuṟṟēvalkaḷ,  
aṭi ārnta āyirattuḷ ivai pattu avaṉ toṇṭarmēl  
muṭivu, ārak kaṟkiṟkil caṉmam ceyyāmai muṭiyumē. (2)

**English translation of verse 3.7.11:**

Those that learn, in right earnest, these songs ten,  
Which expound the glory great of the Godly men,  
Out of the chaste and elegant thousand of Caṭakōpaṉ  
Of Teṉkurukūr, composed in a spirit of dedication  
Unto the Lord who on the five (Pāṇḍavas) shed His grace  
And put an end to the hundred (cousins) viciously prosperous,  
Will have their cycle of births brought to a close.

**Notes**

\(i\) This end-stanza reveals the benefit accruing to those learning this decad without skipping over any stanza. They will not have to be reborn and caught up in the unenviable meshes of worldly life militating against service unto the Lord’s devotees.

\(ii\) The Kauravas’ advancement was at the expense of their five cousins, the Pāṇḍavas, who were, however, very dear to Lord Kṛṣṇa. The vicious hundred naturally met their doom.
