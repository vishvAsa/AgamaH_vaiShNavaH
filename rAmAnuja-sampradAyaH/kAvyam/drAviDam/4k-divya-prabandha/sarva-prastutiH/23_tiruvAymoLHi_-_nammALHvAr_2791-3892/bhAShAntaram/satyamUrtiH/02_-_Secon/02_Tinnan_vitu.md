## 00 Intro2.2
In the last decad, the Āḻvār was confined to the bottom-most depth of dejection and his yearning for the Lord baffled description. It was but meet that the Lord came and presented Himself before such an ardent devotee and saved him from collapsing altogether. It goes without saying that, when the Āḻvār came, face to face, with the Lord, all his erstwhile dejection and the resultant fatigue vanished altogether. The Āḻvār then made up his mind not to allow himself to be swept off once again, by contemplating the Lord’s trait of ‘Saulabhya’ (easy accessibility). He would rather tackle the other plank, safe and steady, namely, the Lord’s overlordship and transcendent glory and sustain himself.

No doubt, in the opening decad of the first centum also, the Āḻvār spoke about the Lord’s Supremacy and transcendent glory. But that was in a different key altogether. There it was direct postulation, as such, running parallel to the Vedic texts. Here, the Āḻvār establishes the Lord’s Supremacy through an elimination of the claims of the possible contenders for this position of Supereminence, citing the relevant anecdotes from the ‘Itihāsas’ and ‘Purāṇas.’ There it was confined solely to the ‘Para’ or transcendent state of the Lord in the High Heavens whereas here, the Supremacy of the Lord is brought out in His ‘Vibhava’ or incarnate state. Speaking about the Avatāras (Incarnations), the Lord’s wondrous deeds can bear endless repetitions, without satiety. Every time the same trait or deed is repeated, there is a freshness about it, with a new aroma.




## 2.2.1
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

திண்ணன் வீடு முதல் முழுதும் ஆய்,  
எண்ணின் மீதியன் எம் பெருமான்,  
மண்ணும் விண்ணும் எல்லாம் உடன் உண்ட, நம்  
கண்ணன் கண் அல்லது இல்லை ஓர் கண்ணே.

tiṇṇaṉ vīṭu mutal muḻutum āy,  
eṇṇiṉ mītiyaṉ em perumāṉ,  
maṇṇum viṇṇum ellām uṭaṉ uṇṭa, nam  
kaṇṇaṉ kaṇ allatu illai ōr kaṇṇē.

**English translation of verse 2.2.1:**

There is no God other than my Sire, Kaṇṇaṉ,  
(Whose traits and possessions) defy enumeration,  
The granter of ‘Mokṣa’, the supreme bliss firm and fine,  
Who at once ate up all the worlds, for their sustentation.

**Note**

The Āḻvār affirms that Lord Kṛṣṇa who enthralled him by His innumerable auspicious traits, is the Supreme Lord of the whole Universe, the granter of Mokṣa, the final bliss. During the period of deluge, He did sustain all the worlds by keeping them within His stomach and this is referred to here, as His having eaten them up. This ‘eating up’ actually connotes that the Lord sustains the worlds and their contents within His stomach with the same relish as one has for food. The minor deities, Brahmā, Rudra and others, are also among those, so sustained by the Lord. Need it be specifically said that the one who sustains is superior to those sustained?




## 2.2.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஏ பாவம் பரமே ஏழ் உலகும்,  
ஈ பாவம் செய்து அருளால் அளிப்பார் ஆர்,  
மா பாவம் விட அரற்குப் பிச்சை பெய்,  
கோபால கோளரி ஏறு அன்றியே.

ē pāvam paramē ēḻ ulakum,  
ī pāvam ceytu aruḷāl aḷippār ār,  
mā pāvam viṭa araṟkup piccai pey,  
kōpāla kōḷari ēṟu aṉṟiyē.

**English translation of verse 2.2.2:**

Who but Kōpālaṉ, the mighty Lion,  
Who unto Araṉ gave alms and from heinous sin  
Redeemed, can the seven worlds graciously sustain.  
Ridding them of all sins? What a pity, none can  
Describe His glory, well beyond enumeration!

**Notes**

\(i\) In the preceding stanza, the Āḻvār averred that there is none superior to Kōpālaṉ (Lord Kṛṣṇa). When some persons questioned the propriety of such an assertion in the face of the Vedic texts glorifying Brahmā, Rudra and other Celestials, the Āḻvār turned round and said: “Well, you had better examine the record of performance of each of them and judge for yourselves. When they all got into trouble, each in his own way, they all sought asylum in Lord Maha Viṣṇu. Could there still be any misgiving about His supremacy over all the rest?”

\(ii\) The Āḻvār feels very much vexed that, in the midst of his God-enjoyment, he should have to leave the track and tackle these deluded enquirers, wasting much precious time in explaining the much-too-obvious, the difference between a priceless gem and poor clay.

\(iii\) The ill-effects of the sins committed by us, in a trice, can hardly be liquidated even after the sufferings of ages and yet it is the Lord’s redemptive grace that grinds them to a halt.




## 2.2.3
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஏறனை பூவனை பூமகள் தன்னை,  
வேறுஇன்றி விண் தொழத் தன்னுள் வைத்து,  
மேல் தன்னை மீதிட நிமிர்ந்து மண் கொண்ட.  
மால் தனின் மிக்கும் ஓர் தேவும் உளதே.

ēṟaṉai pūvaṉai pūmakaḷ taṉṉai,  
vēṟuiṉṟi viṇ toḻat taṉṉuḷ vaittu,  
mēl taṉṉai mītiṭa nimirntu maṇ koṇṭa.  
māl taṉiṉ mikkum ōr tēvum uḷatē.

**English translation of verse 2.2.3:**

Could there be a God greater than Tirumāl, our Lord,  
Who has on His person lodged Ēraṉ (Rudra) and Pūvaṉ Brahmā  
Besides Pūmakaḷ (Lakṣmī, the lotus-born), whom the Devas  
Worship, who upwards grew and measured all the worlds?

**Notes**

\(i\) See notes below 1-3-9 regarding the positions taken up by the exalted Rudra and Brahmā, on the Lord’s person.

The Celestials adore the Lord’s condescending grace in accommodating, on His broad person, besides Śrī Mahālakṣmī, Rudra and Brahmā.

\(ii\) As Trivikrama, He encompassed all the worlds. These are convincing proofs of His supremacy over all the rest.




## 2.2.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

தேவும் எப் பொருளும் படைக்கப்,  
பூவில் நான்முகனைப் படைத்த,  
தேவன் எம் பெருமானுக்கு அல்லால்,  
பூவும் பூசனையும் தகுமே.

tēvum ep poruḷum paṭaikkap,  
pūvil nāṉmukaṉaip paṭaitta,  
tēvaṉ em perumāṉukku allāl,  
pūvum pūcaṉaiyum takumē.

**English translation of verse 2.2.4:**

Can one worship and with flowers decorate  
Any one other than ‘Emperumāṉ’ (our Supreme Lord)  
Who, the lotus-based, four-headed Brahmā, ushered.  
The Devas and the rest to create?

**Notes**

\(i\) Worship can be offered only to the Supreme Lord and being of exquisite charm, He alone is worthy of decoration.

\(ii\) Here is an interesting anecdote:

Prior to his absorption into the Vaiṣṇavite fold, Empār, the illustrious Preceptor (a cousin of Śrī Rāmānuja) was, for some time, serving in the Śivā temple at Kāḷahasti, under the appellation of “Uḷḷaṅkai Koṇarnta Nāyaṉār”. One day, when he stood perched on a tree, gathering flowers for the diurnal worship of the Deity, right underneath, Śrī Tirumalai Nampi, his uncle, was discoursing on this particular stanza to his disciples. The votary, high up on the tree, burst out with an emphatic ‘NO’, in reply to the question put in this stanza, jumped down, tore off his Rudrākṣa necklace (worn by the votaries of Rudra) and fell at the feet of the learned discourser, seeking refuge in him.




## 2.2.5
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

தகும் சீர்த் தன் தனி முதலினுள்ளே,  
மிகும் தேவும் எப் பொருளும் படைக்கத்,  
தகும் கோலத் தாமரைக் கண்ணன் எம்மான்,  
மிகும் சோதி மேல் அறிவார் எவரே.

takum cīrt taṉ taṉi mutaliṉuḷḷē,  
mikum tēvum ep poruḷum paṭaikkat,  
takum kōlat tāmaraik kaṇṇaṉ emmāṉ,  
mikum cōti mēl aṟivār evarē.

**English translation of verse 2.2.5:**

Does one Know of any other, more radiant  
Than our lovely lotus-eyed Lord, omniscient and omnipotent.  
Who, by His resolve unique, could bring into being  
The Devas, (men) and all other things?

**Note**

One of the fundamental characteristics of the Supreme Lord is ‘Puṇḍarīkākṣatva’ (i.e.) His being lotus-eyed. These tell-tale eyes will straightaway proclaim His supremacy. Enthralled by His bewitching looks, the Āḻvār swears that He is the Supreme Lord.

C.f. Śloka 12 of the hymnal gems of Yāmuna, where He queries:

> “Who but Śrīman Nārāyaṇa is the red lotus-eyed?  
> Who but He is Puruṣottama, the highest?”




## 2.2.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

எவரும் யாவையும் எல்லாப் பொருளும்,  
கவர்வு இன்றித் தன்னுள் ஒடுங்க நின்ற,  
பவர் கொள் ஞான வெள்ளச் சுடர் மூர்த்தி,  
அவர் எம் ஆழி அம் பள்ளியாரே,

evarum yāvaiyum ellāp poruḷum,  
kavarvu iṉṟit taṉṉuḷ oṭuṅka niṉṟa,  
pavar koḷ ñāṉa veḷḷac cuṭar mūrtti,  
avar em āḻi am paḷḷiyārē,

**English translation of verse 2.2.6:**

He Who, in His stomach, holds with case,  
The sentient beings, the non-sentient things and all these,  
Is the lovely Lord, of Knowledge immense;  
Dear to me, He of exquisite form lies on the *watery expanse*.

**Note**

This may refer either to the Lord reclining on the milk-ocean or on the watery expanse, during the deluge.




## 2.2.7
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

பள்ளி ஆல் இலை ஏழ் உலகும் கொள்ளும்,  
வள்ளல் வல் வயிற்றுப் பெருமான்,  
உள் உள் ஆர் அறிவார் அவன் தன்,  
கள்ள மாய மனக்கருத்தே.

paḷḷi āl ilai ēḻ ulakum koḷḷum,  
vaḷḷal val vayiṟṟup perumāṉ,  
uḷ uḷ ār aṟivār avaṉ taṉ,  
kaḷḷa māya maṉakkaruttē.

**English translation of verse 2.2.7:**

Who indeed can plumb the unfathomable mind  
Of the Lord Supreme who could hold the worlds seven  
In His stomach, big and tough,  
And repose on a tender fig-leaf?

**Note**

Only the Supreme Lord is capable of achieving the seemingly impossible, blending within Himself the incompatibles, such as holding inside His stomach all the worlds and lying as a tender babe on a fig- leaf floating on the watery expanse. None can indeed probe His mysteries and comprehend them. It can only be said that nothing is beyond Him and there lies the clue to His supremacy.




## 2.2.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கருத்தில் தேவும் எல்லாப் பொருளும்,  
வருத்தித்த மாயப் பிரான் அன்றி, யாரே  
திருத்தித் திண் நிலை மூவுலகும் தம்முள்  
இருத்திக் காக்கும் இயல்வினரே.

karuttil tēvum ellāp poruḷum,  
varuttitta māyap pirāṉ aṉṟi, yārē  
tiruttit tiṇ nilai mūvulakum tammuḷ  
iruttik kākkum iyalviṉarē.

**English translation of verse 2.2.8:**

None but Māyappirāṉ (the Benefactor great of mysterious prowess)  
Can by a mere resolve create Devas and all else.  
Who else can His natural affinity possess  
To preserve by sheer will all the three worlds?

**Note**

This cuts across the popular notion that Brahmā is the functional Deity for creation and Viṣṇu, the Deity for sustentation. Actually, Mahā Viṣṇu controls all the three functions of creation, preservation and dissolution, and Brahmā and Rudra are mere functionaries on His behalf.




## 2.2.9
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

காக்கும் இயல்வினன் கண்ண பெருமான்,  
சேர்க்கை செய்து தன் உந்தியுள்ளே,  
வாய்த்த திசைமுகன் இந்திரன் வானவர்,  
ஆக்கினான் தெய்வ உலகுகளே.

kākkum iyalviṉaṉ kaṇṇa perumāṉ,  
cērkkai ceytu taṉ untiyuḷḷē,  
vāytta ticaimukaṉ intiraṉ vāṉavar,  
ākkiṉāṉ teyva ulakukaḷē.

**English translation of verse 2.2.9:**

Lord Kaṇṇaṉ Whose nature it is to protect.  
Did (at the time of dissolution) collect  
All the worlds into His navel and then create  
Ticaimukaṉ (Brahmā), Intiraṉ and Vāṉavar (Devas) and their worlds (holy and bright).

**Notes**

\(i\) Lord Kṛṣṇa is Supreme, because He controls all the three functions of creation, sustentation and dissolution. It was to dispel the undesirable gloom and grant the coveted felicities that the Lord incarnated as Śri Kṛṣṇa.

\(ii\) At the time of dissolution, one and all, without any exception, get inside Him. This is then followed by re-creation of the worlds and that way, the cyclic process goes on, epoch after epoch.




## 2.2.10
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கள்வா எம்மையும் ஏழ் உலகும், நின்  
உள்ளே தோற்றிய இறைவ! என்று,  
வெள் ஏறன் நான்முகன் இந்திரன் வானவர்,  
புள் ஊர்தி கழல் பணிந்து ஏத்துவரே.

kaḷvā emmaiyum ēḻ ulakum, niṉ  
uḷḷē tōṟṟiya iṟaiva! eṉṟu,  
veḷ ēṟaṉ nāṉmukaṉ intiraṉ vāṉavar,  
puḷ ūrti kaḻal paṇintu ēttuvarē.

**English translation of verse 2.2.10:**

Veḷḷēṟaṉ (Rudra), Nāṉmukaṉ (Brahmā), Indra and Vāṉavar (Devas) congregate  
And worship at the feet of the Lord with that bird (Garuḍa) as His mount  
And unto Him, pray ‘Iṟaiva’ (by your resolve), you brought out  
The seven worlds and us all and yet you will hide out.  
Like a thief, your greatness and to us for favours resort”.

**Notes**

\(i\) The Celestials, including Rudra, with the white bull as bis mount, the four-headed Brahmā, Indra and others of that exalted band, seek various boons from Mahā Viṣṇu, the Supreme Lord, and their power to grant, in turn, the wishes of their votaries is thus derived from Him alone. And yet, they wish to tickle their vanity by making it appear that even the Supreme Lord seeks favour from them. It is noteworthy, Lord Kṛiṣṇa just tickled the vanity of Rudra when He sought from the latter that He be blessed with a son through His consort, Rukmiṇi. It is for this that the Lord has been referred to, in this stanza, as a thief.

\(ii\) Divya Kavi (The poet, *par excellence*), Piḷḷai Perumāḻ Ayyangār exclaims: “Oh, Lord, what a paradox that you, from whom all things emanate, are dubbed a thief for having stolen butter! Actually, we are the thieves, who think and act as if we are our own, not realising that we belong to you, the rightful owner”.




## 2.2.11
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஏத்த ஏழ் உலகும் கொண்ட கோலக்  
கூத்தனைக், குருகூர்ச் சடகோபன் சொல்,  
வாய்த்த ஆயிரத்துள் இவை பத்துடன்,  
ஏத்த வல்லவர்க்கு இல்லை ஓர் ஊனமே.

ētta ēḻ ulakum koṇṭa kōlak  
kūttaṉaik, kurukūrc caṭakōpaṉ col,  
vāytta āyirattuḷ ivai pattuṭaṉ,  
ētta vallavarkku illai ōr ūṉamē.

**English translation of verse 2.2.11:**

For those who learn and laud these songs ten,  
Out of the thousand bequeathed unto us, by Kurukūr Caṭakōpaṉ,  
In adoration of the enchanting Lord, who did span  
With ease, the worlds seven, drawbacks there will be none.

**Notes**

\(i\) Those, who learn these ten songs and enter into their spirit will be firm in their conviction that Mahā Viṣṇu is the Supreme Lord; they will thus be free from the drawbacks of (i) not looking upon Mahā Viṣṇu as the Supreme Lord and (ii) looking upon Deities other than Mahā Viṣṇu, as Supreme, For the matter of that, the solitary episode of Trivikrama, of charming beauty, measuring effortlessly all the worlds in just three strides, is enough to assert Mahā Viṣṇu’s Supremacy.

\(ii\) The Lord’s Supremacy has been set out, in this decad, under various counts, namely, destruction of the sins of devotees and ridding them of distress, being lotuseyed, friend-in-need, achieving the impossible and blending the incompatibles, laudation by the exalted celestials, Rudra, Brahmā and others, control of all the three functions of creation, sustentation and dissolution and so on.
