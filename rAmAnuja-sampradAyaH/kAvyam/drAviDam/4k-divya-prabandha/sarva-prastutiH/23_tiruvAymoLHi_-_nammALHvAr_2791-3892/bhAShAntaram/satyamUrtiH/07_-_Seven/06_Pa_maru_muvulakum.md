## 00 Intro7.6
In the last decad, the Saint’s address to the world is implicit, although the third person has been used throughout, instead of the second. No doubt, the worldlings kept aloof from God because of their exclusive absorption in sensual pleasures, totally shorn of God-love. But then, here is the Āḻvār with an enormous yearning for the Lord, of unimaginable depth and yet, he has not been able to experience the bliss of lasting communion with Him. We have of course seen him ravished by internal joy, during those delirious moments of union with the Lord (mental vision), overflowing its contents and finding expression through hymns adoring Him and extolling His great glory. In the contrary state of desertion by the Lord, he would lament loudly as in this decad, melting the stony hearts of even the ungodly. Śrī Nampiḷḷai puts it that the Āḻvār’s lamentations were so loudly vociferous that it looked as if a vast ocean rose on its feet and roared with all its might; surely it cannot but dislodge the Lord from His seat in the high Heaven and compel Him to come down to the Āḻvār and oblige him with His sweet presence.

Ācārya Ammaṅki Ammal would exclaim:

> “We can only sing and listen to this decad sung by others. We are,
> however, least competent to gauge and express, in concrete language,
> the unfathomable depth of the Āḻvār’s languishment, finding utterance
> in such soul-stirring diction”.




## 7.6.1
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

பாமரு மூவுலகும் படைத்த பற்ப நாபாவோ,  
பாமரு மூவுலகும் அளந்த பற்ப பாதாவோ,  
தாமரைக் கண்ணாவோ! தனியேன் தனிஆளாவோ,  
தாமரைக் கையாவோ! உன்னை என்றுகொல் சேர்வதுவே? (2)

pāmaru mūvulakum paṭaitta paṟpa nāpāvō,  
pāmaru mūvulakum aḷanta paṟpa pātāvō,  
tāmaraik kaṇṇāvō! taṉiyēṉ taṉiāḷāvō,  
tāmaraik kaiyāvō! uṉṉai eṉṟukol cērvatuvē? (2)

**English translation of verse 7.6.1:**

Oh, Paṟpanāpā, Who created the worlds three, vast and varied.  
Oh, Lord with lotus feet that spanned the sprawling worlds three,  
Oh, Lotus-eyed, You are the Master unique of this soul lonely;  
Oh, Lord, with lotus hands, when do I attain Your feet comely?

**Notes:**

\(i\) Paṟpanāpā (*Padmanābhā*): The Supreme Lord, the Primate, from whose navel sprouted the lotus stalk; from the lotus flower at the upward end of that stalk, emerged Brahmā who gave birth to all the rest. The navel of the Lord thus proclaims Him as the First and Foremost.: The implication of the address in the opening line is: “Oh my Sire, can You who created all things, destroy me? I am on the verge of extinction”,

\(ii\) The worlds created by the Lord were misappropriated by Mahā Bali unto himself and hence the Lord had to wrest them back from him. Thus there is reference to the spanning of the worlds by the Lord as Tṛvikrāma. The Lord set His feet then on all and sundries but now He would deny those very feet to the Āḻvār who pines for them.

\(iii\) The Āḻvār was enthralled by the Lord’s lotus eyes and thenceforward he has been subsisting on them alone. How then can the Lord withdraw from the Āḻvār his very sustenance?

\(iv\) It was with His lotus hands that Śrī Kṛṣṇa embraced Akrūra and the same hands dealt a mortal blow to Kaṇṭākarṇa. And now, the Āḻvār is not asking the Lord to embrace him as He embraced Akrūra but only wants Him to say when exactly He would lift him unto His lotus feet, even as He, as Lord Rāma, assured Bharata about His return to Ayodhyā from exile at the end of fourteen years.




## 7.6.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

என்றுகொல் சேர்வது அந்தோ அரன் நான்முகன் ஏத்தும், செய்ய  
நின் திருப்பாதத்தை யான்நிலம் நீர்எரி கால், விண்உயிர்  
என்றுஇவை தாம்முதலா முற்றுமாய் நின்ற எந்தாய்யோ,  
குன்றுஎடுத்து ஆநிரை மேய்த்து அவை காத்த எம்கூத்தாவோ!

eṉṟukol cērvatu antō araṉ nāṉmukaṉ ēttum, ceyya  
niṉ tiruppātattai yāṉnilam nīreri kāl, viṇuyir  
eṉṟuivai tāmmutalā muṟṟumāy niṉṟa entāyyō,  
kuṉṟueṭuttu ānirai mēyttu avai kātta emkūttāvō!

**English translation of verse 7.6.2:**

As the Soul You stand of land, water and fire,  
Air and space, creatures, one and all, oh, Sire,  
You tended the cows and held aloft mount (Govardhan)  
To save them, oh, pot-dancer great alas! when shall I attain  
Your lovely feet, Nāṉmukaṉ (Brahmā) and Araṉ (Śiva) adored?

**Notes:**

The Āḻvār longs for the Lord’s lovely feet, coveted by the exalted Brahmā, the demi-urge, in charge of creation and the eminent Rudra in charge of dissolution. Specially endowed that he is, the Āḻvār can of course conjure up the cosmic vision of the Lord in all things and beings, as their in-dweller but he ‘longs for the Lord’s holy feet in His specialised Form of exquisite charm.




## 7.6.3
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

காத்த எம்கூத்தாவோ! மலைஏந்திக் கல்மாரி தன்னை,  
பூத்தண் துழாய்முடியாய்! புனை கொன்றையஞ் செஞ்சடையாய்,  
வாய்த்த என் நான்முகனே! வந்துஎன் ஆர்உயிர் நீஆனால்,  
ஏத்துஅரும் கீர்த்தியினாய்! உன்னை எங்குத் தலைப்பெய்வனே?

kātta emkūttāvō! malaiēntik kalmāri taṉṉai,  
pūttaṇ tuḻāymuṭiyāy! puṉai koṉṟaiyañ ceñcaṭaiyāy,  
vāytta eṉ nāṉmukaṉē! vantueṉ āruyir nīāṉāl,  
ēttuarum kīrttiyiṉāy! uṉṉai eṅkut talaippeyvaṉē?

**English translation of verse 7.6.3:**

Oh, You Dancer great, aloft You held the mountain  
And beat off the hail storm, on Your crown is tuḷaci, cool and nice,  
Oh, Internal Controller of Śiva and Brahmā! Your glory description defies,  
You are my Soul dear, me, you do, on your own, sustain  
And Yet I know not where You I shall attain?

**Notes:**

\(i\) Indra visited his fury in the shape of a hail storm, raining stones and Lord Kṛṣṇa warded it off by holding mount Govardhan aloft like an umbrella. As Nampiḷḷai puts it in his unique way, the Lord would have lifted the ocean itself instead of the mountain and shielded the subjects, had Indra sent down watery rain instead of the stony one! The Āḻvār now asks whether the Lord will shield only a whole township and that against the fury of the elements instead of a single individual like him, pelted by the rain of sorrow, visited on him by his very existence in this world. Actually, his affliction is much more intense than the combined intensity of the sufferings of a whole township. And yet, the Āḻvār does not want the Lord to lift yet another mountain for his sake but pines only for the sight of the sinewy arms of the Lord, the lifter of Govardhan.

\(ii\) Says the Āḻvār “Oh, Lord, You are the Soul iunto me, Your body. Where is the question of the body attaining the Soul? As one exclusively dependent on You, I know of no Means but You, to attain you. Does it not follow, therefore, that You have to pick me up?”




## 7.6.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

எங்குத் தலைப்பெய்வன் நான்? எழில் மூவுலகும் நீயே,  
அங்கு உயர் முக்கண்பிரான் பிரம பெருமான் அவன்நீ,  
வெங்கதிர் வச்சிரக் கை இந்திரன் முதலாத் தெய்வம்நீ,  
கொங்குஅலர் தண்அம் துழாய்முடி என்னுடைக் கோவலனே?

eṅkut talaippeyvaṉ nāṉ? eḻil mūvulakum nīyē,  
aṅku uyar mukkaṇpirāṉ pirama perumāṉ avaṉnī,  
veṅkatir vaccirak kai intiraṉ mutalāt teyvamnī,  
koṅkualar taṇam tuḻāymuṭi eṉṉuṭaik kōvalaṉē?

**English translation of verse 7.6.4:**

The lovely worlds three You control, oh, Kōvalaṉ, wearing on Your crown,  
Tuḷaci, cool and nice, shedding honey; the triple-eyed Śiva and Brahmā, the exalted  
Are at Your disposal and so is Indra who the mace powerful wields;  
So then, how can I attain You, on my own?

**Notes:**

The Lord having revealed to the Āḻvār, His grand glory, as the great ordainer, maintaining the exalted Brahmā, Śiva and Indra, their respective estates, as the best of all good things and at the same time, His inordinate love for His devotees, it is but meet that the Āḻvār calls upon Him to cut out all his impediments and lift him unto His feet. There is no question of the Āḻvār attaining Him through his own effort. Can a rat-boned weakling be expected to lift a mountain on his back?




## 7.6.5
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

என்னுடைக் கோவலனே! என் பொல்லாக் கருமாணிக்கமே,  
உன்னுடை உந்தி மலர் உலகம் அவைமூன்றும் பரந்து,  
உன்னுடைச் சோதிவெள்ளத்து அகம்பால் உன்னைக் கண்டுகொண்டிட்டு,  
என்னுடை ஆர்உயிரார் எங்ஙனேகொல் வந்து எய்துவரே?

eṉṉuṭaik kōvalaṉē! eṉ pollāk karumāṇikkamē,  
uṉṉuṭai unti malar ulakam avaimūṉṟum parantu,  
uṉṉuṭaic cōtiveḷḷattu akampāl uṉṉaik kaṇṭukoṇṭiṭṭu,  
eṉṉuṭai āruyirār eṅṅaṉēkol vantu eytuvarē?

**English translation of verse 7.6.5:**

Oh, my beloved Kōvalaṉ, sweet unto me like virgin gem,  
How shall this cussed soul, (soaked in worldly pleasures, one and all)  
Attain You and behold Your resplendent Form,  
In the High Heaven, the land aglow, unique and eternal?

**Notes:**

The Āḻvār avers that one like him steeped in sensual pleasures cannot attain the Lord of Supreme Splendour in the High Heaven, except through His spontaneous grace. This is obviously his reply to the question supposed to have been posed unto him by the Lord, whether he should not make some effort to attain the end in view.




## 7.6.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வந்துஎய்து மாறுஅறியேன் மல்கு நீலச் சுடர்தழைப்ப,  
செஞ்சுடர்ச் சோதிகள் பூத்து ஒரு மாணிக்கம் சேர்வதுபோல்,  
அந்தரமேல் செம்பட்டோடு அடி உந்திகை மார்புகண்வாய்,  
செஞ்சுடர்ச் சோதி விடஉறை என்திரு மார்பனையே.

vantueytu māṟuaṟiyēṉ malku nīlac cuṭartaḻaippa,  
ceñcuṭarc cōtikaḷ pūttu oru māṇikkam cērvatupōl,  
antaramēl cempaṭṭōṭu aṭi untikai mārpukaṇvāy,  
ceñcuṭarc cōti viṭauṟai eṉtiru mārpaṉaiyē.

**English translation of verse 7.6.6:**

I know not how to get at my Lord  
Bearing Tiru (Lakṣmī) on the chest and reclining on Serpent bed,  
In the Milk-ocean, His body beaming blue that expands,  
His feet, navel, hands, chest, eyes and lips glowing red,  
Like unto a ruby radiating lovely rays red.

**Notes:**

Here again, the Saint repeats that he has no “Means” other than the Lord reclining in the Milk-ocean like unto a multi-coloured garment spread over the soft, somnolent serpent-bed, and that He should, therefore, admit him unto His fold in the exercise of His voluntary grace.




## 7.6.7
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

என்திரு மார்பன் தன்னை என் மலைமகள் கூறன்தன்னை,  
என்றும் என்நாமகளை அகம்பால்கொண்ட நான்முகனை,  
நின்ற சசிபதியை நிலம்கீண்டு எயில் மூன்றுஎரித்த,  
வென்று புலன்துரந்த விசும்புஆளியை காணேனோ!

eṉtiru mārpaṉ taṉṉai eṉ malaimakaḷ kūṟaṉtaṉṉai,  
eṉṟum eṉnāmakaḷai akampālkoṇṭa nāṉmukaṉai,  
niṉṟa cacipatiyai nilamkīṇṭu eyil mūṉṟueritta,  
veṉṟu pulaṉturanta vicumpuāḷiyai kāṇēṉō!

**English translation of verse 7.6.7:**

Shall I behold Him that bears on His chest, Tiru, my Mother,  
The Internal Controller of the Spouses of Malaimakaḷ, Nāmakaḷ,  
And Cacī, the Redeemer of Earth, who did help Brahmā, conquer,  
The senses, the destroyer great of the triple citadels?

**Notes:**

The Lord got Brahmā and Śiva married to their respective consorts, Malaimakaḷ (Pārvatī) and Nāmakaḷ (Sarasvati) and so also Indra to Saśi as the parent gets the sons, come of age, suitable brides. The Lord is also the Internal Controller of all including these exalted personalities. There are certain things like redemption of the Earth by the Lord Himself, assuming the gigantic form of a Boar and certain others like the destruction of the Tripurā (three citadels) and the three demoniac brothers who ruled the citadels, functioning as the Internal Controller of Rudra. Brahmā, the Demiurge had to acquire control over the senses, preparatory to his being entrusted with the task of creation.




## 7.6.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஆளியைக் காண்பரியாய் அரிகாண் நரியாய், அரக்கர்  
ஊளைஇட்டு அன்று இலங்கைகடந்து பிலம்புக்குஒளிப்ப,  
மீளியம் புள்ளைக்கடாய் விறல் மாலியைக் கொன்று, பின்னும்  
ஆள்உயர் குன்றங்கள் செய்து அடர்த்தானையும் காண்டும்கொலோ?

āḷiyaik kāṇpariyāy arikāṇ nariyāy, arakkar  
ūḷaiiṭṭu aṉṟu ilaṅkaikaṭantu pilampukkuoḷippa,  
mīḷiyam puḷḷaikkaṭāy viṟal māliyaik koṉṟu, piṉṉum  
āḷuyar kuṉṟaṅkaḷ ceytu aṭarttāṉaiyum kāṇṭumkolō?

**English translation of verse 7.6.8:**

When shall I behold my Lord Who did mount the lovely bird (Garuḍa)  
And annihilate the Asuras who from Laṅkā fled and hid  
Inside the underworld, like the horse by the Dinosaur scared.  
And the fox by the lion, slew the formidable Māli and his hordes  
Throwing up the corpses into heaps of mountains tall?

**Notes:**

The incidents, set out in chapters 5 to 8 of Rāmāyaṇa, Uttara Kāṇḍa, are alluded to in this song:

Mālyavān, Māli and Sumāli, the three sons of Śukeśa, a Rākṣasa, acquired enormous strength through terrific penance, settled in Laṅka and raised a huge population giving endless trouble to the Devas. The Devas, who sought the help of Lord Śrīman Nārāyaṇa, were vouchsafed by Him, protection. This enraged the Asuras who invaded the upper worlds, surrounded the Lord who appeared there, mounted on Garuḍa and engaged Him in a pitched battle. When Mali was slain by the Lord, his brothers Mālyavān and Sumāli encountered Him and were also beaten off. The two Asura chiefs then retreated, along with the remaining followers, into the Pāthāla (underworld) and hid themselves there. Sumāli’s daughter, named, Kaikaśi gave birth to Rāvaṇa and others.

The Āḻvār would want to know when he can enjoy the supreme bliss of beholding the Lord who can undoubtedly cut out all his foes (impediments) even as He destroyed these formidable demons. In the first two songs of this decad, the Lord has been set out as the goal, the next five songs reveal that He is also the ‘Means’ for attaining Him while in this and the next two songs, He is shown as the great Redeemer, vanquishing the forces of evil and thus cutting out all our sins.




## 7.6.9
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

காண்டும்கொலோ நெஞ்சமே! கடிய வினையே முயலும்,  
ஆண்திறல் மீளிமொய்ம்பின் அரக்கன் குலத்தைத் தடிந்து,  
மீண்டும் அவன் தம்பிக்கே விரி நீர்இலங்கைஅருளி,  
ஆண்டு தன் சோதிபுக்க அமரர் அரியேற்றினையே?

kāṇṭumkolō neñcamē! kaṭiya viṉaiyē muyalum,  
āṇtiṟal mīḷimoympiṉ arakkaṉ kulattait taṭintu,  
mīṇṭum avaṉ tampikkē viri nīrilaṅkaiaruḷi,  
āṇṭu taṉ cōtipukka amarar ariyēṟṟiṉaiyē?

**English translation of verse 7.6.9:**

My mind, shall we at all behold the Chief of Celestials,  
Who the clan routed of (Rāvaṇa) the formidable Asura bent on evil  
And on the throne of Laṅkā, the peninsular Kingdom, installed,  
(Vibhīṣaṇa), his brother, returned to Ayodhyā and there ruled  
Thousands of years and then to the Celestium returned?

**Notes:**

The Āḻvāṟ enquires of his mind whether he will be able to behold Lord Rāma in the glorious setting in Heaven, surrounded by Angels, soaked in God-love, unlike the Earth where the ungodly aimed missiles at Him.




## 7.6.10
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஏற்றுஅரும் வைகுந்தத்தை அருளும் நமக்கு, ஆயர்குலத்து  
ஈற்றுஇளம் பிள்ளைஒன்றாய்ப்புக்கு மாயங்களே இயற்றி,  
கூற்றுஇயல் கஞ்சனைக் கொன்று ஐவர்க்காய் ஆக்கொடும்சேனைதடிந்து,  
ஆற்றல் மிக்கான் பெரிய பரஞ்சோதி புக்க அரியே

ēṟṟuarum vaikuntattai aruḷum namakku, āyarkulattu  
īṟṟuiḷam piḷḷaioṉṟāyppukku māyaṅkaḷē iyaṟṟi,  
kūṟṟuiyal kañcaṉaik koṉṟu aivarkkāy ākkoṭumcēṉaitaṭintu,  
āṟṟal mikkāṉ periya parañcōti pukka ariyē

**English translation of verse 7.6.10:**

Surely, we will be granted the Heaven, difficult to attain,  
By the merciful Ari, Who entered Gokul as a Babe just born,  
Worked many a wonder ere the devilish Kañcaṉ was by Him slain,  
Got the armies of the cruel enemies routed, as a Partisan  
Of the five brothers and repaired back to the High Heaven,  
Still feeling that enough unto them hasn’t been done.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The Āḻvār is now placating his mind to which he had posed the question, as in the last song.

\(ii\) Kṛṣṇa, as a mere Babe and later, as a Boy, worked many wonders culminating in the slaying of the fiendish Kaṃsa who had tried all methods he could possibly conceive of, to do away with the Divine Child. And when Kṛṣṇa came of age, He controlled the wonderful military strategy in that great battle at Kurukṣetra and led the Pāṇḍavas to victory against the evil-minded Kauravas. Having done so much, the Lord still felt He had not done enough unto His devotees. How magnanimous of Him! And what more? Even after His return to Heaven, His fury over the demoniac Kaṃsa, Duryodhana etc., remained unabated.




## 7.6.11
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

புக்க அரிஉருஆய் அவுணன்உடல் கீண்டுஉகந்த,  
சக்கரச் செல்வன்தன்னைக் குருகூர்ச் சடகோபன் சொன்ன,  
மிக்க ஓர்ஆயிரத்துள் இவைபத்தும் வல்லார் அவரைத்,  
தொக்கு பல்லாண்டுஇசைத்து கவரி செய்வர் ஏழையரே (2)

pukka ariuruāy avuṇaṉuṭal kīṇṭuukanta,  
cakkarac celvaṉtaṉṉaik kurukūrc caṭakōpaṉ coṉṉa,  
mikka ōrāyirattuḷ ivaipattum vallār avarait,  
tokku pallāṇṭuicaittu kavari ceyvar ēḻaiyarē (2)

**English translation of verse 7.6.11:**

Those that are well-versed in these songs ten,  
Out of the illustrious thousand composed by Caṭakōpaṉ,  
Of Kurukūr, adoring Tirumāl, wielding the discus fine,  
Who, as the Man-Lion marvellous, emerged and tore open,  
Avuṇaṉ’s body, will the High Heaven attain,  
And there the damsels bright will adore them and entertain.

**Notes:**

Although the Lord did not wield the discus or, for the matter of that, any other weapon during His Avatāra as Nara-Siṃhā, it could be seen from ‘Sudarśana Śatakam’ that that the aura of Sudarśan (Discus) permeated Narasiṃha’s nails, which tore open Avuṇaṉ’s (Hiraṇya’s) body. The chanters of this decad will have a good reception in Heaven, attended upon by the Apsarās over there. See also X-9-7.
