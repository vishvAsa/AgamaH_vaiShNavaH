## 00 Intro10.4
In the preceding decad, the Āḻvār suffered the pangs of separation from the Lord, akin to those experienced by the Gopīs, even when the Lord was in their midst. Just as the Gopīs were placated by Lord Kṛṣṇa, the Āḻvār was pacified by the Lord and his fears were quelled when the Lord assured him that He would no longer get parted from him. Rid of the fear of prolongation of his bondage, the Āḻvār is now jubilant over the near prospect of his ascent to the Lord’s feet in Heaven. He, therefore, gets busy in giving the finishing touches, appropriate to this grand hymnal of unparalleled sweetness and grandeur. He has begun to realise the fruits of the devotion (Bhakti), preached by him to others, right from I-2 and onwards. It may be recalled that Rāvaṇa turned a deaf ear to Vibhīṣaṇa’s pious entreaty and advice but it only intensified the latter’s devotion which led him on to Rāma’s camp itself. This decad sets out how God is attainable through love.




## 10.4.1
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

சார்வே தவநெறிக்குத் தாமோதரன் தாள்கள்  
கார்மேக வண்ணன் கமல நயனத்தன்  
நீர்வானம் மண்எரி கால்ஆய் நின்ற நேமியான்  
பேர் வானவர்கள் பிதற்றும் பெருமையனே. (2)

cārvē tavaneṟikkut tāmōtaraṉ tāḷkaḷ  
kārmēka vaṇṇaṉ kamala nayaṉattaṉ  
nīrvāṉam maṇeri kālāy niṉṟa nēmiyāṉ  
pēr vāṉavarkaḷ pitaṟṟum perumaiyaṉē. (2)

**English translation of verse 10.4.1:**

Unto those that tread the loving path of devotion,  
Facile indeed are the lovely feet of cloud-hued Tāmōtaraṉ  
Of red lotus eyes, who does as the five elements stand,  
Who sports the discus, whose glory grand,  
The pre-eminent ones in Heaven for ever chant.

**Notes:**

The Āḻvār affirms that the lovely feet of Tāmōtaraṉ (Dāmodara, that is, Lord Kṛṣṇa, Who displays His simplicity galore, exhibiting, on His tummy, the scar caused by the rope tied round it by Mother Yaśodhā) render the pursuit of the path of loving surrender, quite facile—see also I-3-5, where the Āḻvār exhorted the worldlings to stick to the path of loving surrender, imbibing the quintessence of the Lord’s own teachings, in His “Song Celestial”, When we talk of the Lord having been tied by a rope round the tummy, during His Avatāra as Kṛṣṇa, the cow-herd boy, our bondage of Saṃsāra goes off. There is a happy blending of supremacy and simplicity in the Lord and He is, therefore, easily worshippable. The Āḻvār sets out, in this song, the Lord’s great qualities of head and heart as well as His exquisite charm. The Lord pervades all things and beings and not merely the five elements of fire, air, water, space and earth, as such.




## 10.4.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

பெருமையனே வானத்து இமையோர்க்கும் காண்டற்கு-  
அருமையனே ஆகத்தணை யாதார்க்கு என்றும்-  
திருமெய் உறைகின்ற செங்கண்மால் நாளும்-  
இருமை வினைகடிந்து இங்கு என்னைஆள்கின்றானே.

perumaiyaṉē vāṉattu imaiyōrkkum kāṇṭaṟku-  
arumaiyaṉē ākattaṇai yātārkku eṉṟum-  
tirumey uṟaikiṉṟa ceṅkaṇmāl nāḷum-  
irumai viṉaikaṭintu iṅku eṉṉaiāḷkiṉṟāṉē.

**English translation of verse 10.4.2:**

Of grandeur great that does surpass the Celestials  
In the upper worlds, the Lord is hardly visible  
To those that do not in His heart lovingly inhere;  
The lotus-eyed Lord, Who holds Tiru, for ever,  
On His person, has the fruits wiped out, right here,  
Of my acts, good and bad, and on top of that  
Enlisted me in His service, day in and day out.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The felicity, conferred by the Lord’s lovely feet on those pursuing the path of loving devotion, was pointed out, in general, in the preceding song. From this song and onwards, the Āḻvār sets out the benefits accrued to him, personally. The Lord has bestowed on the Āḻvār, right here, the felicity of divine service, that is usually attainable in Heaven alone.

\(ii\) “*Inaccessible to those who do not inhere in His heart*”

The Lord is inaccessible to those who do not bear any love for Him and are, therefore, not eager to envision Him and commune with Him. As a matter of fact, it is only to those on whom His spontaneous grace alights (Paragata svīkāra), that He becomes accessible.




## 10.4.3
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஆள்கின்றான் ஆழியான் ஆரால் குறைவுஉடையம்?  
மீள்கின்றதுஇல்லை பிறவித் துயர்கடிந்தோம்  
வாள்கெண்டை ஒண்கண் மடப்பின்னை தன்கேள்வன்  
தாள்கண்டு கொண்டு என் தலைமேல் புனைந்தேனே.

āḷkiṉṟāṉ āḻiyāṉ ārāl kuṟaivuuṭaiyam?  
mīḷkiṉṟatuillai piṟavit tuyarkaṭintōm  
vāḷkeṇṭai oṇkaṇ maṭappiṉṉai taṉkēḷvaṉ  
tāḷkaṇṭu koṇṭu eṉ talaimēl puṉaintēṉē.

**English translation of verse 10.4.3:**

The Lord, Who the discus wields, did us liberate  
From the miseries of birth, once for all; there’s none else  
Whose help we need, my head I do decorate  
With the lovely feet of the bright, fish-eyed Piṉṉai’s Spouse.

**Notes:**

The Āḻvār’s mind is now absolutely clear about the immediate prospect of his ascent to Heaven and so sanguine is he that he asserts that his age-long misery of birth and rebirth is gone and that there is no question of his getting caught up in the dreadful cycle, any more. Even so, a little later, that is, X-10-2, he pleads vehemently with the Lord for the quick consummation of their deeply-longed-for union and even goes to the extent of binding Him and His Consort (Mahā Lakṣmī) on oath, for the accomplishment of the goal in question. Questioned by the Lord Himself, in that context, regarding the propriety of the Āḻvār binding Him and the Divine Mother on oath, the Āḻvār is quick to justify his conduct because of the exuberance of his God-love and his impatience to get at Him.




## 10.4.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

தலைமேல் புனைந்தேன் சரணங்கள் ஆலின்-  
இலைமேல் துயின்றான் இமையோர் வணங்க  
மலைமேல்தான் நின்று என்மனத்துள் இருந்தானை  
நிலைபேர்க்கல்ஆகாமை நிச்சித்துஇருந்தேனே.

talaimēl puṉaintēṉ caraṇaṅkaḷ āliṉ-  
ilaimēl tuyiṉṟāṉ imaiyōr vaṇaṅka  
malaimēltāṉ niṉṟu eṉmaṉattuḷ iruntāṉai  
nilaipērkkalākāmai niccittuiruntēṉē.

**English translation of verse 10.4.4:**

Adorned have I my head with the feet of the Lord,  
Who did on a fig-leaf repose, Who is by Celestials adored,  
Right here, in Mount Tiruvēṅkaṭam, where He just stands,  
For Him to secure a berth in my mind,  
Where I am sure He now remains firmly enshrined.

**Notes:**

\(i\) the Āḻvār recounts the manner in which the Lord contrived to get Himself lodged firmly in his heart and how complacent He feels after reaching His coveted destination. The Lord, Who reposed on a tender fig-leaf over the vast expanse of water, stepped on to Mount Tiruvēṅkaṭam, the spring-board from which He jumped into the Āḻvār’s heart. When He sustained aḷḷ the worlds with their contents inside His stomach, resting on the fig-leaf, He was all alone and nobody knew the manner and extent of His benefaction. And so, He hit upon a plan by which He could demonstrate to all the worlds, His great benevolence and omnipotence, amazing simplicity and easy accessibility. It was in pursuance of this plan that He repaired to Mount Tiruvēṅkaṭam, along with the Nitya Sūrīs, the Eternal heroes in Heaven. Once this was accomplished, He moved into the Āḻvār’s heart-region and established Himself firmly therein, the ultimate destination of His long travail. Here then is the beautifully phased programme of the Lord’s journey to the Āḻvār’s heartcentre, which would have just given way under excessive joy, had the Lord stepped on to it straightway.

As a matter of fact, the Lord’s attachment to the Gnostic’s (Jñāni’s) physical form even surpasses His love for the pilgrim centres where He has condescended to shed His grace on His votaries, in ‘Arca’ (worshippable, iconic Form). This is quite understandable, seeing that the very purpose of His manifestation in ‘Arca’ Form is only to get hold of His subjects, by some means or the other. And when He gets His catch all right and it is a big haul at that, as in the case of the Āḻvār, His gratification knows no bounds. The Lord’s stay in the pilgrim centres is, therefore, not an end in itself but only a means for the reclamation of His subjects, His ultimate destination being the heart-centre of the spiritually regenerated subjects. Once the destination is reached, the means employed for reaching it get relegated to a position of secondary importance. It is then the turn of a devotee like Pēyāḻvār to request the Lord not to relax His interest in the pilgrim centres, which operate as the spring-board whence the Lord could reach His devotees, His ultimate destination. It is now a case of the Lord loving the pilgrim centres, firstly, as places adored by His devotees and secondly, out of gratitude to those centres for helping Him to reclaim His subjects, by turning them God-ward.

\(ii\) It is with such a deep yearning that the Lord is firmly ensconced in the heart-centre of the Saint. There is no question of His getting out on His own. Of course, the Āḻvār, endowed with a mind soaked in God-love, will do nothing to unsettle the Lord from His coveted position inside his heart and dislodge Him.




## 10.4.5
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நிச்சித்துஇருந்தேன் என்நெஞ்சம் கழியாமை  
கைச்சக்கரத்துஅண்ணல் கள்வம் பெரிதுஉடையன்  
மெச்சப்படான் பிறர்க்கு மெய்போலும் பொய்வல்லன்  
நச்சப்படும் நமக்கு நாகத்து அணையானே.

niccittuiruntēṉ eṉneñcam kaḻiyāmai  
kaiccakkarattuaṇṇal kaḷvam perituuṭaiyaṉ  
meccappaṭāṉ piṟarkku meypōlum poyvallaṉ  
naccappaṭum namakku nākattu aṇaiyāṉē.

**English translation of verse 10.4.5:**

Sanguine am I that the Lord stays firm in my heart,  
My Sire, holding the discus, has many a secret plan I know not.  
Disclose He shan’t to the impious His qualities great,  
True unto the devout, He shall the otherwise delude,  
He is our goal indeed, the One lying on serpent-bed.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The Āḻvār is jubilant that the Lord, Who did all that austere penance for getting at him, namely, lying on the bosom of the waters and standing on the hill-top, is now firmly entrenched in his heart. And what more? There is still so much that the Lord is intending to do for him, which he will get to know, only in due course.

\(ii\) Whereas the Lord is incessantly pouring unto His devotees, in super-abundance, marvellous communications of His divine nature and the devotees shall, all the time, discover something new, He shall conceal His great qualities of head and heart, so far as the ungodly, impious persons are concerned. While the Saint sings His glory in such a prolific manner, the deluded duds and the ungodly persons hardly possess the necessary equipment for meditating on Him or singing His glory. Though looking impartial and inclined to extend the same treatment to Arjuna and Duryodhana alike, Lord Kṛṣṇa did, in the final analysis, punish the wicked Duryodhana and reward the righteous Arjuna.

\(iii\) If the Lord rests on Ādiśeṣa, a fellow-devotee of ours and is so intimate with him, it only inspires in us hopes of the possibility of His being intimate with us, as well.




## 10.4.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நாகத்து அணையானை நாள்தோறும் ஞானத்தால்  
ஆகத்தணைப் பார்க்கு அருள்செய்யும் அம்மானை  
மாகத்து இளமதியம் சேரும் சடையானைப்  
பாகத்து வைத்தான் தன் பாதம் பணிந்தேனே.

nākattu aṇaiyāṉai nāḷtōṟum ñāṉattāl  
ākattaṇaip pārkku aruḷceyyum ammāṉai  
mākattu iḷamatiyam cērum caṭaiyāṉaip  
pākattu vaittāṉ taṉ pātam paṇintēṉē.

**English translation of verse 10.4.6:**

Blest am I to adore the feet of the Lord,  
Who keeps, on one side of His body, him that sports  
On matted locks the crescent Moon, the Sire great,  
Who sheds for ever His grace on those  
Whose knowledge blooms into love that does embrace,  
In their hearts, Him that does on serpent-bed repose.

**Notes:**

\(i\) What is emphasised here by the Āḻvār is the need for transforming one’s knowledge of God into love for Him. Knowledge of God is wisdom’s root while love of God is its ripest fruit. In His Song Celestial also, Lord Kṛṣṇa insists on loving meditation. Of-course, He sedulously nurtures the God-love of the devotees to the point of fruition. It would be futile to expect our wandering minds to get fixed on the Lord, all the time, unless His grace alights on us at His sweet volition.

\(ii\) The tender solicitude of the Lord is indicated here, by pointing out how He has assigned a part of His body to Śiva, who is donning the crescent Moon on malted locks.




## 10.4.7
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

பணிநெஞ்சே! நாளும் பரம பரம்பரனை  
பிணிஒன்றும் சாரா பிறவி கெடுத்துஆளும்  
மணிநின்ற சோதி மதுசூதன் என்அம்மான்  
அணிநின்ற செம்பொன் அடல்ஆழி யானே.

paṇineñcē! nāḷum parama paramparaṉai  
piṇioṉṟum cārā piṟavi keṭuttuāḷum  
maṇiniṉṟa cōti matucūtaṉ eṉammāṉ  
aṇiniṉṟa cempoṉ aṭalāḻi yāṉē.

**English translation of verse 10.4.7:**

Of splendour great like sapphire is Matucūtaṉ, my Sire,  
The One that wields the discus, flamboyant like gold;  
The Lord Supreme, Who the miseries of birth dispelled,  
And made me His vassal, Worship, my mind, for ever;  
That dreadful disease [of Saṃsāra] shall afflict us, no more.

**Notes:**

The Āḻvār exhorts his God-bent mind to worship for ever the Supreme Lord of exquisite charm, the great Deliverer. The Sovereign Lord will cut out all our miseries, right at the source, namely, the cycle of birth and rebirth, where one gets caught up in the whirlpool of Saṃsāra, a self-perpetuating dreadful disease. Reference to the Lord, as ‘Madhusūdha’, is significant; even as He destroyed the demons, called Madhu and Kaiṭaba, He will cut out all the impediments standing in the way of our serving Him, of exquisite charm. Blessed indeed are those that behold the Lord, holding the dazzling discus, and drink deep that nectarean charm.




## 10.4.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஆழியான் ஆழி அமரர்க்கும் அப்பாலான்  
ஊழியான் ஊழி படைத்தான் நிரைமேய்த்தான்  
பாழிஅம் தோளால் வரைஎடுத்தான் பாதங்கள்  
வாழி என்நெஞ்சே! மறவாது வாழ்கண்டாய்.

āḻiyāṉ āḻi amararkkum appālāṉ  
ūḻiyāṉ ūḻi paṭaittāṉ niraimēyttāṉ  
pāḻiam tōḷāl varaieṭuttāṉ pātaṅkaḷ  
vāḻi eṉneñcē! maṟavātu vāḻkaṇṭāy.

**English translation of verse 10.4.8:**

Inaccessible is my Lord, Who holds the discus on,  
Even to the exalted Celestials; He stayed all alone  
During the deluge great, Time and all else He did ordain,  
Cows He did tend and save by lifting mount (Govardhan)  
On His shoulder, fit and fine; may you, my mind, prosper,  
Adoring without fail His lovely feet for ever,  
Let me hail indeed this state of affairs.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The Āḻvār’s mind having responded well to his exhortation, in the preceding song, he now pats on its back and calls upon it to adore the Lord’s feet without intermission. After all the exertion put forth for achieving the end in view, it is usual for people to relax and rest on their oars, once the destination is reached. It is precisely this common failing that the Āḻvār wants his mind to guard against. He advises it to persevere in its adoration of the Lord’s lovely feet, with no break whatever.

\(ii\) He, who created myriads of things, incarnated as Kṛṣṇa in the shepherd clan, palmed off as Nanda’s son, as if He too was created like others. His tending the cows has indeed a special significance. Unable to tend themselves, the cows, as a class, would not resist the Lord’s aid and strike a divergent path, as we folks do. Verily, this is the essence of ‘Prapaṭti’ or surrender to the Lord’s grace—“Bhagavad pravṛtti virodhi svapravṛtti nivṛtti-prapatti”.




## 10.4.9
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கண்டேன் கமல மலர்ப்பாதம் காண்டலுமே  
விண்டே ஒழிந்த வினையாயின எல்லாம்  
தொண்டேசெய்து என்றும் தொழுது வழியொழுக  
பண்டே பரமன் பணித்த பணிவகையே.

kaṇṭēṉ kamala malarppātam kāṇṭalumē  
viṇṭē oḻinta viṉaiyāyiṉa ellām  
toṇṭēceytu eṉṟum toḻutu vaḻiyoḻuka  
paṇṭē paramaṉ paṇitta paṇivakaiyē.

**English translation of verse 10.4.9:**

Beheld have I the Lord’s lotus feet and the moment I saw them,  
Root and branch have all my sins been cut out and unto Him  
Deep love in me has been engendered; Him I do adore  
With no break, true to His dictates, as of old.

**Notes:**

The Āḻvār gratefully acknowledges the Lord’s spontaneous grace, which enabled him to behold His lotus feet which are not accessible even to the exalted Celestials in the upper regions, despite rigorous penance for ages. The moment he saw the Lord’s lovely feet, all his accumulated sins of ages got blotted out, *in toto*, true to His promise, “Ahaṃ tvā sarva pāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi” (Bhagavad Gītā XVIII—66). Although Lord Kṛṣṇa had said, in His ‘Song Celestial’, no more than this, the Āḻvār, endowed by the Lord himself with spiritual knowledge, full and complete, elucidates the full import of the Lord’s promise in question. He says that the word “Mokṣayiṣyāmi” does not mean mere emancipation from bondage, the dreadful cycle of birth and rebirth, but eternal service unto the Lord, as well, in keeping with the subject’s essential nature, as the Lord’s exclusive vassal.




## 10.4.10
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வகையால் மனம்ஒன்றி மாதவனை நாளும்-  
புகையால் விளக்கால் புதுமலரால் நீரால்  
திசைதோறு அமரர்கள் சென்று இறைஞ்ச நின்ற  
தகையான் சரணம் தமர்கட்குஓர் பற்றே.

ticaitōṟu amararkaḷ ceṉṟu iṟaiñca niṉṟa  
takaiyāṉ caraṇam tamarkaṭkuōr paṟṟē.

**English translation of verse 10.4.10:**

There’s no haven, so safe and sound, unto the devout,  
As the lovely feet of Mātavaṉ, our Sire, sought out  
And worshipped by the Celestials, stationed all over,  
Who, with a mind duly fixed on Him, offer, ever and anon,  
Choice flowers, water, lamp and burn incense fine.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The Āḻvār concludes this decad by empahsising that the Lord is the one and only Giver, the sole Means for all votaries, irrespective of whether they seek Him out for personal ends or employ other means to attain Him or submit themselves to His loving grace.

\(ii\) Mādhava holds on His winsome chest His coveted Bride, the Divine Mother, the great intercessor between Man and God. Although the ‘Carama Śloka’ (Bhagavad Gītā XVIII.66) does not contain any direct reference to the Lord’s conjunction with Mahā Lakṣmī, the Divine Mother, the Āḻvār would appear to have understood the word ‘Ahaṃ’, occurring in the second half of the Śloka, to refer to the Lord, in conjunction with Mahā Lakṣmī. Actually, of the three esoteric texts, ‘Tirumantra ‘Dvaya’ and ‘Carama Śloka’, the middle one alone contains a specific reference to this holy combination of the Lord and Mahālakṣmī. It should, however, be noted that ‘Carama Śloka’ is only an elaboration of ‘Dvaya’, which again elaborates ‘Tirumantra’.

**Notes:**

The chanters of this decad shall easily attain the lovely pair of feet of the Supreme Lord, whose omnipotence helps to vanquish all the enemies, the impediments that stand in the way of His ardent devotees attaining Him.
