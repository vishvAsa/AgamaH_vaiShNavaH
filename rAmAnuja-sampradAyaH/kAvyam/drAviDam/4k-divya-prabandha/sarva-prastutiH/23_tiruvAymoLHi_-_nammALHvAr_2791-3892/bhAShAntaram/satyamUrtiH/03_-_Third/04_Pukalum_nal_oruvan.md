## 00 Intro3.4
In the preceding decad, the Āḻvār was all agog to serve the Lord, at all times and in every conceivable manner, without break or blemish. Profoundly impressed by the intensity of the Āḻvār’s yearning for Divine service, the Lord very much wished to make his task easy and so threw into focus His unique faculty of omnipresence, *pervading all things, all over* and *at all times*. Coming face to face with the Lord’s immense ubiquity in various forms, the Āḻvār was in the same predicament as the one gathering the fruits dropped down the trees in a violent gale, finding it difficult to pick and choose. The phenomenon before him was so amazing and of such astounding dimensions that the Āḻvār, who resorted to singing the Lord’s glory (which is also a form of service, namely, service by word of mouth—Vācika Kaiṅkarya), just didn’t know where to begin and what to say. It is the Lord’s immanence that the Āḻvār attempted to sing about, in this decad.

One of the Lord’s several names is ‘Ananta’, the endless. He is limitless and immeasurable, not being circumscribed by space and time. The unique feature about the Supreme Lord, Mahāviṣṇu is that He is not only not circumscribed by space and time but He also abides in all, without any exception, the sentient beings and non-sentient things, one and all, constituting, as it were, His bodies. This is, in fact, the keynote of Viśiṣṭādvaita philosophy. The ‘Śarīṛa-Śarīri bhāva’. This was mentioned in passing, in the first decad of the first centum itself. And now, this is being elaborated upon, in this decad.




## 3.4.1
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

புகழும் நல் ஒருவன் என்கோ! பொரு இல் சீர்ப் பூமிஎன்கோ,  
திகழும் தண் பரவை என்கோ! தீ என்கோ! வாயு என்கோ,  
நிகழும் ஆகாசம் என்கோ! நீள் சுடர் இரண்டும் என்கோ,  
இகழ்வு இல் இவ் அனைத்தும் என்கோ கண்ணனைக் கூவும் ஆறே!

pukaḻum nal oruvaṉ eṉkō! poru il cīrp pūmieṉkō,  
tikaḻum taṇ paravai eṉkō! tī eṉkō! vāyu eṉkō,  
nikaḻum ākācam eṉkō! nīḷ cuṭar iraṇṭum eṉkō,  
ikaḻvu il iv aṉaittum eṉkō kaṇṇaṉaik kūvum āṟē!

**English translation of verse 3.4.1:**

How shall I speak of Kaṇṇaṉ, (my all-pervading Lord)?  
Shall I say, He is the one by all sacred texts adored  
Or shall I describe Him as peerless Earth or Ocean bright?  
Could I say He is fire or air or the space athwart,  
Or the Sun and the Moon, rather their aggregate?

**Note**

The Āḻvār looks on, in bewildering amazement, when the Lord presents Himself as an embodiment of the elements that have gone into the making of the universe and its multifarious contents, His auspicious qualities also shining forth, side by side. Unlike others who could see everything in its outer form only, the Āḻvār discerns the Lord in each and everything, and nothing can, therefore, be eschewed by him as being disagreeable. He sees the Lord in every thing, individually and in the aggregate. What would seem despicable in the light of one’s own association, becomes wholly agreeable, viewed in the light of their conjunction with the Lord, (aphorism 149, Acārya Hṛdayam).




## 3.4.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கூவும் ஆறு அறியமாட்டேன் குன்றங்கள் அனைத்தும் என்கோ,  
மேவு சீர் மாரி என்கோ! விளங்கு தாரகைகள் என்கோ,  
நா இயல் கலைகள் என்கோ! ஞான நல்ஆவி என்கோ,  
பாவு சீர்க் கண்ணன் எம்மான் பங்கயக் கண்ணனையே!

kūvum āṟu aṟiyamāṭṭēṉ kuṉṟaṅkaḷ aṉaittum eṉkō,  
mēvu cīr māri eṉkō! viḷaṅku tārakaikaḷ eṉkō,  
nā iyal kalaikaḷ eṉkō! ñāṉa nalāvi eṉkō,  
pāvu cīrk kaṇṇaṉ emmāṉ paṅkayak kaṇṇaṉaiyē!

**English translation of verse 3.4.2:**

I know not what to call kaṇṇaṉ, my lotus-eyed Lord,  
Of qualities great and vast, could He be called  
The aggregate of all mountains or the rains lovely  
Or the bright stars or all that learning by the tongue cultivated  
Or sweet sounds pregnant with meanings lofty?

**Notes**

\(i\) In this song, the Āḻvār sees the Lord in the several products of the various elements, referred to, in the previous song. Thus, the lotus-eyed Lord is also seen as the mountain range. It is the earth (Pṛtvi [*pṛthvī*]) that hardens into mountains, providing, in turn, stable support to the former. The rains pertain to the element known as water. Pleasant to behold, the rains provide all facilities to the denizens of the world and the rainclouds are also comparable to the Lord’s complexion.

The bright stars owe their structure, composition and luminosity to the element of fire, while all that knowledge imparted by word of mouth is rendered possible by the element called air. Transmission of sound is effected through the medium of space (ākāśa). If sound is looked upon as the body, knowledge is its soul. Sound becomes worth its while only when it conveys the right meanings and nourishes the soul with the right type of knowledge.

\(ii\) It only bespeaks the unlimited glory of the Lord and the immeasurable extent of His possessions, if even Saint Nammāḻvār, endowed with full and complete knowledge by the Supreme Lord Himself, should fumble and falter, unable to give adequate expression to the Lord’s attributes and acquisitions, His flooding fame etc.




## 3.4.3
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

பங்கயக் கண்ணன் என்கோ! பவளச் செவ்வாயன் என்கோ,  
அம் கதிர் அடியன் என்கோ! அஞ்சன வண்ணன் என்கோ,  
செங்கதிர் முடியன் என்கோ! திரு மறு மார்பன் என்கோ,  
சங்கு சக்கரத்தன் என்கோ! சாதி மாணிக்கத்தையே!

paṅkayak kaṇṇaṉ eṉkō! pavaḷac cevvāyaṉ eṉkō,  
am katir aṭiyaṉ eṉkō! añcaṉa vaṇṇaṉ eṉkō,  
ceṅkatir muṭiyaṉ eṉkō! tiru maṟu mārpaṉ eṉkō,  
caṅku cakkarattaṉ eṉkō! cāti māṇikkattaiyē!

**English translation of verse 3.4.3:**

Shall I call the rare blue gem of a Lord,  
The lotus-eyed or the coral-lipped  
Or the one with a pair of feet, lovely and bright  
Or one dark like collyrium or one that sports  
The crown dazzling red or one on whose chest  
Are ‘Tiru’ (Lakṣmī) and Maṟu (Śrīvatsa [*śrīvatsam*], the spiral spot)  
Or one that wields the conch and the discus?

**Notes**

\(i\) In the two preceding stanzas, the Āḻvār described the Lord’s universal aspect and now he describes Him, in His own exclusive form. As a matter of fact, the Āḻvār could discern the Lord in both the Universal and Individual forms with the same ease.

\(ii\) It is indeed interesting to study the sequence set out in the above stanza. The Āḻvār begins with the Lord’s lotus-eyes which shed grace on him and befriended him; next in order is the bewitching smile of the Lord which is an even greater attraction than the Lord’s entrancing looks and hence the mention of the coral lips. And now, the Subjects, attracted by the Lord’s lovely looks and captivating smile, seek refuge at His comely feet; the votaries then enjoy the charming complexion of the Lord. The Lord’s crown, indicative of His overlordship, does not, however, scare them off when they behold the Divine Mother, the grand Intercessor on the Lord’s chest. But then, this exquisite conjunction of the Divine couple induces a sense of fear, a growing apprehension in the minds of the devout regarding the safe continuance of this glorious combination but the weapons held by the Lord in His hands, the conch and the discus, dispel this fear and put them at ease.




## 3.4.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

சாதி மாணிக்கம் என்கோ! சவி கொள் பொன் முத்தம் என்கோ  
சாதி நல் வயிரம் என்கோ, தவிவு இல் சீர் விளக்கம் என்கோ,  
ஆதி அம் சோதி என்கோ! ஆதி அம் புருடன் என்கோ,  
ஆதும் இல் காலத்து எந்தை அச்சுதன் அமலனையே!

cāti māṇikkam eṉkō! cavi koḷ poṉ muttam eṉkō  
cāti nal vayiram eṉkō, tavivu il cīr viḷakkam eṉkō,  
āti am cōti eṉkō! āti am puruṭaṉ eṉkō,  
ātum il kālattu entai accutaṉ amalaṉaiyē!

**English translation of verse 3.4.4:**

Shall I say that ‘Accutan’ is my immaculate Lord  
Who fathered me, when forlorn and (ever afterwards)  
Held on to me, is the pure gem or the shining gold  
Or the ruby flashy or choice diamond or the eternal lamp  
Or the One of resplendent form or the blissful Primate?

**Notes**

\(i\) Asked by a worldling for tips as to how to remember the Supreme Lord, a knowledgeable elder queried back, “Pray, tell me how to forget God”. The Lord is everywhere, stays in all things having name and form and hence the wise men always perceive the Lord’s intimate contact and presence in each and everything. That is why the Lord has said in His ‘Song Celestial’ (10-41) whatever is of superlative eminence contains a special element of His all-conquering power. The Āḻvār, therefore, says that, with a natural, built-in Grace, bliss and beauty, God is the very best of all good things.

\(ii\) The eternal lamp that God is, He is anterior to all other luminous bodies, like Sun and Moon.

\(iii\) *Acyuta, the eternal Father*: While in a forlorn state, with no attainment whatever, on his part, to attract the Lord’s grace, the Lord, on His own, revealed to the Āḻvār the indissoluble bond subsisting between them, the inviolable ‘Father-Son’ relationship and held on to him firmly thereafter.




## 3.4.5
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அச்சுதன் அமலன் என்கோ, அடியவர் வினை கெடுக்கும்,  
நச்சும் மா மருந்தம் என்கோ! நலங் கடல் அமுதம் என்கோ,  
அச்சுவைக் கட்டி என்கோ! அறுசுவை அடிசில் என்கோ,  
நெய்ச் சுவைத் தேறல் என்கோ! கனி என்கோ! பால் என்கேனோ!

accutaṉ amalaṉ eṉkō, aṭiyavar viṉai keṭukkum,  
naccum mā maruntam eṉkō! nalaṅ kaṭal amutam eṉkō,  
accuvaik kaṭṭi eṉkō! aṟucuvai aṭicil eṉkō,  
neyc cuvait tēṟal eṉkō! kaṉi eṉkō! pāl eṉkēṉō!

**English translation of verse 3.4.5:**

Shall I my Lord, as Accutaṉ (the steadfast) call  
Or the Immaculate or high class medicine delectable  
That cuts out the devotees’ ills and evils  
Or the nectar that came up the milk ocean fine or fix  
Him as the cream delicious or the meal with tastes six  
Or the honey as tasty as ghee or fruit or milk?

**Notes**

\(i\) True to the Upaniṣadik text, depicting the Lord as very delicious, the Āḻvār presents the Lord here as all those things that are juicy and appetising.

\(ii\) *Cutting out the devotees’ ills and evils*: The expression ‘Ills and evils’ is used in a comprehensive sense, covering the effective operation of both ‘Puṇya’ and ‘Pāpa’, as the former is a golden fetter and the latter, an iron fetter and thus both are impediments, seeing that a golden fetter is, all the same, a fetter. The Lord, on His part, will not confine Himself to a life of ease and peace, in the high heavens, but come down post-haste to the rescue of His devotees, as He did in the case of Gajendra, the elephant. Again, the ills He cures are not the ordinary bodily ailments but the much worse malady of the soul. The Lord is, therefore, referred to as the delectable medicine, easy to take and absolutely harmless even if the directions for its use are given the go-by or not closely adhered to.

\(iii\) The Lord is indeed far superior to the nectar that was obtained by churning the milk ocean. The Lord, the non-satiate nectar, will make Himself available to His beloved devotees without undergoing the rigours of churning the ocean.




## 3.4.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

பால் என்கோ! நான்கு வேதப் பயன் என்கோ, சமய நீதி  
நூல் என்கோ! நுடங்கு கேள்வி இசை என்கோ! இவற்றுள் நல்ல  
மேல் என்கோ, வினையின் மிக்க பயன் என்கோ, கண்ணன் என்கோ!-  
மால் என்கோ! மாயன் என்கோ வானவர் ஆதியையே!

pāl eṉkō! nāṉku vētap payaṉ eṉkō, camaya nīti  
nūl eṉkō! nuṭaṅku kēḷvi icai eṉkō! ivaṟṟuḷ nalla  
mēl eṉkō, viṉaiyiṉ mikka payaṉ eṉkō, kaṇṇaṉ eṉkō!-  
māl eṉkō! māyaṉ eṉkō vāṉavar ātiyaiyē!

**English translation of verse 3.4.6:**

Shall I as Milk, (the Lord), foremost among celestials, call  
Or as the paramount Vedas four or the Śāstras that reveal  
The Vedic religion in proper light  
Or as the music enchanting or as one above them all  
Or as the fruits many of one’s endeavour bright  
Or as Kaṇṇaṉ, Māl (Tirumāl), Māyaṉ (the Lord of wondrous deeds and traits)?

**Notes**

\(i\) The Lord is the quintessence of the vedās, the supreme authority revealing Him. The Lord has Himself declared, in XV-15 of Bhagavad Gītā, that He alone is denoted by the Vedās, in their entirety.

The Śāstras, referred to, are the sacred texts, such as Itihāsas, Purāṇas etc, which elucidate the moot points in the Vedas and serve as an effective key or guide to the abstruse vedic texts.

\(ii\) *The wondrous Lord*: The wonder lies in that the Overlord of the Celestials serves His devotees in the humblest manner, such as running an errand, driving the chariot etc.

\(iii\) Even as a small quantity of seeds sown produces a rich harvest of grains, the Lord showers on us a plethora of benefits, out of all proportion to the magnitude of our efforts, real or feigned.




## 3.4.7
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வானவர் ஆதி என்கோ! வானவர் தெய்வம் என்கோ,  
வானவர் போகம் என்கோ! வானவர் முற்றும் என்கோ,  
ஊனம் இல் செல்வம் என்கோ! ஊனம் இல் சுவர்க்கம் என்கோ,  
ஊனம் இல் மோக்கம் என்கோ! ஒளி மணி வண்ணனையே!

vāṉavar āti eṉkō! vāṉavar teyvam eṉkō,  
vāṉavar pōkam eṉkō! vāṉavar muṟṟum eṉkō,  
ūṉam il celvam eṉkō! ūṉam il cuvarkkam eṉkō,  
ūṉam il mōkkam eṉkō! oḷi maṇi vaṇṇaṉaiyē!

**English translation of verse 3.4.7:**

Shall I call the lustrous Sire, gem-hued, as the Overlord  
Of Celestials or the God Supreme by them adored  
Or the One by them enjoyed and their all,  
Or the treasure inexhaustible or undying pleasures  
Of *Suvarkkam* (Svarga) or *mōkkam* (mokṣa), the bliss eternal?

**Notes**

\(i\) ‘*Celestials*’: This denotes, in particular, the ‘Nitya Sūris’ in Heaven to whom the Lord is the ‘Be-all’ and ‘End-all’, the Sole Sustainer.

\(ii\) *Bliss eternal*: Heaven, the Eternal Land, with its perennial scope for eternal service unto the Lord, as distinguished from the ‘Kaivalya’ type of Mokṣa or emancipation where the liberated (dis-embodied) Soul denies itself the bliss of Divine Service and gets lost in self-enjoyment.

\(iii\) While the pleasures of Svarga too, are of a limited tenure at the end of which the individual is hurled down to the Earth, the Lord is referred to in this context, as the everlasting pleasure, not time-bound.




## 3.4.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஒளி மணி வண்ணன் என்கோ! ஒருவன் என்று ஏத்த நின்ற  
நளிர் மதிச் சடையன் என்கோ! நான்முகக் கடவுள் என்கோ,  
அளி மகிழ்ந்து உலகம் எல்லாம் படைத்து அவை ஏத்த நின்ற,  
களி மலர்த் துளவன் எம்மான் கண்ணனை மாயனையே!

oḷi maṇi vaṇṇaṉ eṉkō! oruvaṉ eṉṟu ētta niṉṟa  
naḷir matic caṭaiyaṉ eṉkō! nāṉmukak kaṭavuḷ eṉkō,  
aḷi makiḻntu ulakam ellām paṭaittu avai ētta niṉṟa,  
kaḷi malart tuḷavaṉ emmāṉ kaṇṇaṉai māyaṉaiyē!

**English translation of verse 3.4.8:**

Could I call Kaṇṇaṉ, my Liege-Lord of wondrous traits and deeds,  
Sporting the floral garland of tuḷacī which honey sheds,  
Who the worlds did with delight create and is by them adored,  
As the lustrous One of sapphire hue or as Śiva, who sports  
The cool crescent Moon on matted locks and stands revered  
(By his votaries) as the God supreme or as Nāṉmukaṉ (Brahmā, the four-headed)?

**Notes**

\(i\) The Āḻvār points out here that Śiva, sporting the cool, crescent Moon on his matted locks, mistakenly revered by some as the Supreme and Brahmā, the four-headed Demi-urge, also form part of Lord Viṣṇu’s possessions.

\(ii\) ‘*Liege-Lord*’: Viṣṇu, who put the Āḻvār on the right track and thereby made him solely worship Him, without straying into the domain of worship of the lesser deities.




## 3.4.9
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கண்ணனை மாயன் தன்னை கடல் கடைந்து அமுதம் கொண்ட,  
அண்ணலை அச்சுதனை அனந்தனை அனந்தன் தன்மேல்,  
நண்ணி நன்கு உறைகின்றானை ஞாலம் உண்டு உமிழ்ந்த மாலை,  
எண்ணும் ஆறு அறியமாட்டேன், யாவையும் எவரும் தானே.

kaṇṇaṉai māyaṉ taṉṉai kaṭal kaṭaintu amutam koṇṭa,  
aṇṇalai accutaṉai aṉantaṉai aṉantaṉ taṉmēl,  
naṇṇi naṉku uṟaikiṉṟāṉai ñālam uṇṭu umiḻnta mālai,  
eṇṇum āṟu aṟiyamāṭṭēṉ, yāvaiyum evarum tāṉē.

**English translation of verse 3.4.9:**

I know not how to comprehend Kaṇṇaṉ, the wondrous Lord,  
The glorious Sire, Who the ocean churned and ambrosia delivered,  
Accutaṉ (the Protector steadfast) of glory unlimited,  
Who on Aṉantaṉ (Serpent) does repose, safe and sound,  
Tirumāl (of tender solicitude), who (during deluge) sustained  
All the worlds in His stomach and (later) spat them out;  
Indeed all things and beings He does Himself constitute.

**Note**

The Āḻvār who attempted earlier an enumeration of the Lord’s cosmic wealth, has now given it up as impossible and rests contented with a summary statement that He is the aggregate of all non-sentient things and sentient beings.

Cf. the Lord’s own declaration, in Bhagavad Gītā X-19, that there is no end to the details of things and beings under His control (the vibhūtīs).




## 3.4.10
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

யாவையும் எவரும் தானாய் அவரவர் சமயம் தோறும்,  
தோய்வு இலன் புலன் ஐந்துக்கும் சொலப்படான் உணர்வின் மூர்த்தி,  
ஆவி சேர் உயிரின் உள்ளால் ஆதும் ஓர் பற்று இலாத,  
பாவனை அதனைக் கூடில் அவனையும் கூடலாமே.

yāvaiyum evarum tāṉāy avaravar camayam tōṟum,  
tōyvu ilaṉ pulaṉ aintukkum colappaṭāṉ uṇarviṉ mūrtti,  
āvi cēr uyiriṉ uḷḷāl ātum ōr paṟṟu ilāta,  
pāvaṉai ataṉaik kūṭil avaṉaiyum kūṭalāmē.

**English translation of verse 3.4.10:**

Knowledge personified is my Lord who stays within  
All things and beings and yet does apart remain  
From their weal and woe, much beyond the ken  
Of comprehension of the senses five; appreciate you can,  
Growth and decay unto the body pertain and not the Soul within,  
Stays likewise the Lord inside the Soul (aloof from its weal and woe).

**Note**

This stanza clearly brings out the fact that the Lord who has stationed Himself inside all things and beings, is not affected by their changing fortunes, weal or woe, even as the Individual Soul occupying a particular body is not affected by the biological changes of growth and decay undergone by the body. But then, it might be argued that the Individual Soul partakes of the pain and pleasure experienced through the medium of the body and on this analogy, the Lord inside all cannot also remain unaffected by such experiences. This doubt can, however, be resolved by contrasting the manner in which the Lord and the Individual Soul got inside the body. Whereas the Individual Soul has occupied the body as the medium appropriate to his or her working out the load of Karma, the Lord gets inside the soul at His volition, for the resuscitation of the subject. The Individual is the convict serving a term of imprisonment inside the prison-house, which the body is, while the Lord is like unto the distinguished jail visitor, contemplating the ways and means of welfare and rehabilitation of the prisoners.

The above is the interpretation of Emperumāṉār (Rāmānuja); the other interpretation, namely, exclusive devotion unto the Lord (Super Soul) inside the individual Soul, will enable the latter to attain the former has been brushed aside by him as a misfit, in the present context of highlighting the immanence of the Lord, where it is imperative to bring out that the Lord pervades all things and beings without, at the same time, partaking of their character.




## 3.4.11
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கூடி வண்டு அறையும் தண் தார்க் கொண்டல் போல் வண்ணன் தன்னை  
மாடு அலர் பொழில் குருகூர் வண் சடகோபன் சொன்ன,  
பாடல் ஓர் ஆயிரத்துள் இவையும் ஓர் பத்தும் வல்லார்,  
வீடு இல போகம் எய்தி விரும்புவர் அமரர் மொய்த்தே. (2)

kūṭi vaṇṭu aṟaiyum taṇ tārk koṇṭal pōl vaṇṇaṉ taṉṉai  
māṭu alar poḻil kurukūr vaṇ caṭakōpaṉ coṉṉa,  
pāṭal ōr āyirattuḷ ivaiyum ōr pattum vallār,  
vīṭu ila pōkam eyti virumpuvar amarar moyttē. (2)

**English translation of verse 3.4.11:**

Those that are well versed in these songs ten,  
Out of the peerless thousand sung by gracious caṭakōpaṉ  
Of Kurukūr, amid blooming orchards many, in adoration  
Of the cloud-hued Lord, sporting cool tuḷaci garland,  
The gay resort of honey bees, will the heaven ascend  
And eternal service enjoy, becoming the Celestials’ favourites.

**Notes**

\(i\) *Gracious caṭakōpaṉ*: The Āḻvār’s grace lies not in his seeing the Lord, in all things and beings, but in his making us also realise it, through these songs.

\(ii\) The Nitya Sūris (Celestials in Heaven) love those that recite these ten songs. This is because of their great love and regard for the Āḻvār who possesses Divine knowledge on a par with them, despite his location down below in this land of darkness and nescience.
