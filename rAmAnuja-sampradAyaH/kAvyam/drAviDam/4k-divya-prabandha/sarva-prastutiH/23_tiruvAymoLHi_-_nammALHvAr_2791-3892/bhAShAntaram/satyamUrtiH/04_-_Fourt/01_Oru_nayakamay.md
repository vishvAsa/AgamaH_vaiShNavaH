## 00 Intro4.1
The last centum ended on a very happy note, an exuberant Āḻvār, gratefully conscious of the felicities showered on him by a loving Lord, declaring that he is above wants of any kind and free from afflictions of any kind. Just the opposite is, however, the plight of the ‘Saṃsāris’ (worldlings), and it was out of an irrepressible fellow-feeling and deep compassion that the Āḻvār tried to bring them all, on a par with him and advised them in III-9 (coṉṉāl virōtam) to give up running after the petty humans and their petty wealth. The desired response was, however, not forthcoming presumably because the men whom the Āḻvār then addressed were thinking in terms of somehow enriching themselves by waiting on the so called earthly potentates. And yet, the Āḻvār’s tender solicitude turns his attention on to them once again, and that too, so soon. In this decad, he impresses upon his addressees that, for all their mountainous labours, they get much less than a mouse, in return, the so-called wealth they acquire being after all much-too-flimsy and fleeting. So saying, the Āḻvār calls upon these straying subjects to realise the importance of holding on to the Supreme Lord as an end in itself, the wealth supreme and everlasting.

In VII-16 of Bhagavad Gītā, the Lord has referred to four types of votaries propitiating Him. These are: (1) Ārta, the sorrow stricken ones who wish to get back their lost wealth; (2) *Arthārthī*, the poor men craving for wealth and power, (3) Jijñāsu, the seeker of the self, that is, emancipation from the cycle of birth and death and enjoyment of the disembodied soul in the ultra-mundane sphere, known as ‘Kaivalya Mokṣa’ and (4) Jñāni, the gnostic, fully alive to the essential nature of the Individual Soul as the sole servitor of the Lord, seeking the Lord as the final goal and looking upon Him as the sole Means for attaining the end in view.

All the four categories of supplicants have, however, been labelled as ‘Sukṛts’ (persons with good deeds to their credit) although all but the ‘Jñānis’ would, strictly speaking, deserve to be termed as ‘Dhuṣkṛt’, craving, as they do, for the lower or inferior fruits. This is because all of them seek whatever they want from the Supreme Lord, instead of committing the further transgression of cooling their heels elsewhere, that is, at the door steps of the minor deities or the so-called earthly magnates. Of course, the Lord would no: mince matters any more, and He brings out, in un-ambiguous terms, the special greatness and glory of the ‘Jñāni’ in the three succeeding ślokas (7-17 to 19). The Jñāni, engrossed in the Lord as the highest goal, is dear to the Lord beyond words, and is looked upon by the Lord as His very self. The Āḻvār is only echoing this theme in this decad, pointing out the Superior stance of the Jñāni, which the people of the world should strive after, and deprecating the pursuit after the intransient riches and the inferior goal of ‘Kaivalya Mokṣa’.

For facility of recapitulation it may be pointed out that the Āḻvār has been similarly addressing the world, off and on, with an eye on its uplift and deliverance, vide 1-2, II-8, IIḷ-6 and III-9.




## 4.1.1
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஒரு நாயகமாய் ஓட உலகு உடன் ஆண்டவர்,  
கரு நாய் கவர்ந்த காலர் சிதைகிய பானையர்,  
பெரு நாடு காண இம்மையிலே பிச்சை தாம் கொள்வர்,  
திருநாரணன் தாள் காலம்பெறச் சிந்தித்து உய்ம்மினோ.

oru nāyakamāy ōṭa ulaku uṭaṉ āṇṭavar,  
karu nāy kavarnta kālar citaikiya pāṉaiyar,  
peru nāṭu kāṇa immaiyilē piccai tām koḷvar,  
tirunāraṇaṉ tāḷ kālampeṟac cintittu uymmiṉō.

**English translation of verse 4.1.1:**

The monarchs great who did once hold sway supreme,  
Will, under the nose of the worlds they ruled, seek alms  
With broken bowls in hand, on legs by black dogs bitten.  
Be quick, therefore, ye, men, to meditate on the feet  
Of Tirunāraṇaṉ where indeed lies your salvation.

**Notes**

\(1\) The first three lines speak about the *ephemeral* wealth while the remaining lines deal with *Eternal* wealth. That the earthly riches, whatever their magnitude, are evanescent, has been brought out by citing the well-known example of mighty monarchs being reduced, in one and the same span of life, to abject poverty, seeking alms under cover of night. Treading upon black dogs during nights, the distinguised beggars get bitten of them but desist from crying out their pain for fear of attracting public attention. But then, the earthen begging bowls drop down from their hands and the resultant noise draws huge crowds witnessing the pathetic plight of their erstwhile monarch. Oh, what a pitiable contrast between these broken earthen bowls and the decorated bowls of gold they ate from before; people who couldn’t have dreamt of coming face to face with the monarch or would have to wait for months before gaining entry into the Palace gates, could now see him right on the road, with an apology of a begging bowl held by the hand which once doled out large territories to petty princes and nobles. So then, the Āḻvār exhorts the men around to adore the feet of Śrīman Nārāyaṇa, the Donor, *par excellance* and attain salvation, the everlasting opulence of Divine Service.

This decad is in propitiation of the Deity, known as ‘Veda Nārāyaṇa’, enshrined in Toṭṭiyam Tirunārāyaṇapuram, in Musiri Taluk, Tiruchirapalli District, in Tamil Nadu. Tradition has it that, during his slay of twelve years in Tirunārāyaṇapuram (Melkōṭ), in Karnāṭaka State, Śrī Rāmānujācārya affectionately bestowed this decad unto the Deity of that pilgrim centre, going by the name ‘Tirunārāyaṇaṉ’.




## 4.1.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

உய்ம்மின் திறைகொணர்ந்து என்று உலகு ஆண்டவர், இம்மையே  
தம் இன்சுவை மடவாரைப் பிறர் கொள்ளத் தாம் விட்டு  
வெம் மின் ஒளிவெயில் கானகம் போய்க் குமைதின்பர்கள்,  
செம்மின் முடித் திருமாலை விரைந்து அடி சேர்மினோ.

uymmiṉ tiṟaikoṇarntu eṉṟu ulaku āṇṭavar, immaiyē  
tam iṉcuvai maṭavāraip piṟar koḷḷat tām viṭṭu  
vem miṉ oḷiveyil kāṉakam pōyk kumaitiṉparkaḷ,  
cemmiṉ muṭit tirumālai viraintu aṭi cērmiṉō.

**English translation of verse 4.1.2:**

Lose no time in worshipping ‘Tirumāl’, with lustrous crown,  
Seeing that the earthly overlords who did dominate for long,  
With many a minor Chief paying unto them tributes, grow forlorn,  
Losing, in this very birth, their kingdoms and consorts dear  
And eke out miserable existence in the formidable forest yonder.

**Notes**

\(i\) Even those mighty kings who held sway for long, keeping under their heels many a chieftain forced to pay them tributes, lose their vast kingdoms and become helpless spectators when the lovely damsels kept in their proud harem, are forcibly seized by others under their very nose. If this happens to the mighty overlords what to say about the lesser men and their so-called riches? The Āḻvār, therefore, calls upon his fellow-beings to worship the feet of Lord Viṣṇu (Tirumāl) and attain Him, the Eternal Wealth, the inexhaustible fountain of perennial bliss.

\(ii\) The Paṇḍavas who celebrated the ‘Rājasūya Yāga’ with great pomp and eclat, had to retire into the forest and their wife, Draupadi, was badly handled under their very nose.

\(iii\) Unto those who seek Him, the Lord is there to part with His very crown; there are His consorts to plead for us and get from the Lord His choicest favours and yet, the default lies on our past, in not hastening.




## 4.1.3
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அடி சேர் முடியினர் ஆகி அரசர்கள் தாம் தொழ,  
இடி சேர் முரசங்கள் முற்றத்து இயம்ப இருந்தவர்,  
பொடி சேர் துகளாய்ப் போவர்கள் ஆதலில் நொக்கெனக்,  
கடி சேர் துழாய்முடிக் கண்ணன் கழல்கள் நினைமினோ.

aṭi cēr muṭiyiṉar āki aracarkaḷ tām toḻa,  
iṭi cēr muracaṅkaḷ muṟṟattu iyampa iruntavar,  
poṭi cēr tukaḷāyp pōvarkaḷ ātalil nokkeṉak,  
kaṭi cēr tuḻāymuṭik kaṇṇaṉ kaḻalkaḷ niṉaimiṉō.

**English translation of verse 4.1.3:**

The earthly overlords of empires mighty, who care least  
For the kings who on them wait days on end and get lost  
In singing and dancing, the drums in the courtyards beating fast,  
Will, in no time, get ground to mere bits of dust;  
Be quick, therefore, to meditate on the feet of Kaṇṇaṉ,  
Wearing tuḷaci garland full of fragrance sweet on His Crown.

**Note**

The supercilious overlords who once took pride in despising their subordinates, will soon be reduced to a predicament wherein they will, in turn, be despised by others. From the durbar hall to the dust is not a long way cff and these men of erstwhile eminence become imperceptible non-entities, as good as the life-less dust men tread upon. The Āḻvār, therefore, advises us to spurn the ephemeral wealth of the world and switch on to the feet of the Lord wearing the sweet ṭuḷaci garland on His crown, the symbol of His undisputed sovereignty over one and all.




## 4.1.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நினைப்பான் புகில் கடல் எக்கலின் நுண்மணலில் பலர்,  
எனைத்தோர் உகங்களும் இவ் உலகு ஆண்டு கழிந்தவர்,  
மனைப்பால் மருங்கு அற மாய்தல் அல்லால் மற்றுக் கண்டிலம்,  
பனைத் தாள் மத களிறு அட்டவன் பாதம் பணிமினோ.

niṉaippāṉ pukil kaṭal ekkaliṉ nuṇmaṇalil palar,  
eṉaittōr ukaṅkaḷum iv ulaku āṇṭu kaḻintavar,  
maṉaippāl maruṅku aṟa māytal allāl maṟṟuk kaṇṭilam,  
paṉait tāḷ mata kaḷiṟu aṭṭavaṉ pātam paṇimiṉō.

**English translation of verse 4.1.4:**

The number of those that ruled for long this land  
And into oblivion passed, leaving no trace behind  
Of their erstwhile possessions and things around.  
Far exceeds the particles of the sea-sand minute;  
So then, worship the feet of the one Who slew  
(Kuvalayāpīṭa [Kuvalayāpīḍa]) the monstrous elephant in rut.

**Note**

When a mighty tree comes crashing down, it destroys quite a few things all around, as well. Likewise, when the kingdoms of the earthly Lords perished the territories around also got wiped off, the unrelenting ravage of time! The Āḻvār is emphasising the intransigence of the mundane wealth in so many ways, song after song. Side by side, he stresses the positive need for worshipping Viṣṇu, the Supreme Lord, the Eternal Wealth. During His avatāra as Kṛṣṇa, the Lord slew that monstrous elephant in rut set on Him by Kaṃsa, the felon of an uncle, by pulling out the tusks.




## 4.1.5
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

பணிமின் திருவருள் என்னும் அம் சீதப் பைம் பூம் பள்ளி,  
அணி மென் குழலார் இன்பக் கலவி அமுது உண்டார்,  
துணி முன்பு நால பல் ஏழையர் தாம் இழிப்ப செல்வர்,  
மணி மின்னு மேனி நம் மாயவன் பேர் சொல்லி வாழ்மினோ.

paṇimiṉ tiruvaruḷ eṉṉum am cītap paim pūm paḷḷi,  
aṇi meṉ kuḻalār iṉpak kalavi amutu uṇṭār,  
tuṇi muṉpu nāla pal ēḻaiyar tām iḻippa celvar,  
maṇi miṉṉu mēṉi nam māyavaṉ pēr colli vāḻmiṉō.

**English translation of verse 4.1.5:**

Sing and subsist on the holy names of our wondrous Lord,  
Shining like blue-gem, seeing that those who seek  
The bed, cool and lovely and pine for getting locked  
In the sweet embrace of the damsels sleek,  
With fine stresses of hair, become poor and under-clad,  
Going about begging, by many a woman ridiculed.

**Note**

Even the glamour of sensual pleasures wears cut soon; with energy dissipated and wealth gone, the participants cut a sorry figure, becoming the objects of ridicule by those very persons who once adored them. The material, wealth and the sensual pleasures derived therefrom, therefore, deserve to be eschewed alike. On the other hand, one should eke out one’s existence, singing the Sweet names of the Lord of innumerable auspicious traits.




## 4.1.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வாழ்ந்தார்கள் வாழ்ந்தது மாமழை மொக்குளின் மாய்ந்து மாய்ந்து,  
ஆழ்ந்தார் என்று அல்லால் அன்று முதல் இன்று அறுதியா,  
வாழ்ந்தார்கள் வாழ்ந்தே நிற்பர் என்பது இல்லை நிற்குறில்,  
ஆழ்ந்து ஆர் கடற்பள்ளி அண்ணல் அடியவர் ஆமினோ.

vāḻntārkaḷ vāḻntatu māmaḻai mokkuḷiṉ māyntu māyntu,  
āḻntār eṉṟu allāl aṉṟu mutal iṉṟu aṟutiyā,  
vāḻntārkaḷ vāḻntē niṟpar eṉpatu illai niṟkuṟil,  
āḻntu ār kaṭaṟpaḷḷi aṇṇal aṭiyavar āmiṉō.

**English translation of verse 4.1.6:**

Probing, since the beginning of time, into the lives of those  
Said to have flourished in this world in yonder days,  
You will find that they stayed not for ever  
In that state but vanished like bubbles in rain water;  
So then, if you seek life that truly lasts,  
Become the vassal of the Sire Who on the deep ocean rests.

**Note**

The earthly opulence goes on dwindling with the passage of time; from the beginning of creation up till now, it has been seen that the so-called earthly magnates, said to have flourished in this world with all that show of affluence, did not last long. They had their cups of sorrow duly served, while the riches of the mundane world buried them deep into the earth and they could thus never get off the ground to which they got themselves consigned. The Lord’s lotus feet alone can lift us up to eternal existence in its true sense. The Lord reposing on the milk-ocean is concerting ways and means of reclaiming us and it behoves us to co-operate with Him and make His task easier.




## 4.1.7
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஆம் இன் சுவை அவை ஆறோடு அடிசில் உண்டு ஆர்ந்தபின்,  
தூ மென் மொழி மடவார் இரக்கப் பின்னும் துற்றுவார்,  
ஈமின் எமக்கு ஒரு துற்று என்று இடறுவர் ஆதலின்,  
கோமின் துழாய் முடி ஆதி அம் சோதி குணங்களே.

ām iṉ cuvai avai āṟōṭu aṭicil uṇṭu ārntapiṉ,  
tū meṉ moḻi maṭavār irakkap piṉṉum tuṟṟuvār,  
īmiṉ emakku oru tuṟṟu eṉṟu iṭaṟuvar ātaliṉ,  
kōmiṉ tuḻāy muṭi āti am cōti kuṇaṅkaḷē.

**English translation of verse 4.1.7:**

Those who had a surfeit of hearty drinks  
And delicious dishes, pampered by sweet-tongued damsels,  
Will soon lose all that wealth and, at ruin’s brink,  
Go about begging for food, morsel by morsel;  
Better sing and enjoy in a chorus the renown  
Of the Lord resplendent with tuḷaci garland on His crown.

**Note**

This is yet another stanza wherein the Āḻvār brings out, in sharp contrast, the fleeting and the firm, the ephemeral and the eternal. The pompous participants in the pleasures of the world put up a poor show when their wealth is gone and health is lost, naturally forsaken by the sycophants who once paraded in their courts and pampered them. Recounting the great glory of the Lord and His auspicious traits, one can, however, enjoy the eternal bliss, with no ups and downs like its earthly counterpart, the mundane happiness.




## 4.1.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

குணம் கொள் நிறை புகழ் மன்னர் கொடைக்கடன் பூண்டிருந்து,  
இணங்கி உலகு உடன் ஆக்கிலும் ஆங்கு அவனை இல்லார்,  
மணம் கொண்ட போகத்து மன்னியும் மீள்வர்கள் மீள்வு இல்லை,  
பணம் கொள் அரவு அணையான் திருநாமம் படிமினோ.

kuṇam koḷ niṟai pukaḻ maṉṉar koṭaikkaṭaṉ pūṇṭiruntu,  
iṇaṅki ulaku uṭaṉ ākkilum āṅku avaṉai illār,  
maṇam koṇṭa pōkattu maṉṉiyum mīḷvarkaḷ mīḷvu illai,  
paṇam koḷ aravu aṇaiyāṉ tirunāmam paṭimiṉō.

**English translation of verse 4.1.8:**

Even kings, good and bounteous, with a great name,  
Who wealth immense do wield,  
Will come to grief if they propitiate not the Lord Supreme;  
Recite them, the holy names of the Lord on serpent-bed  
And wealth eternal do earn.

**Note**

Even kings of flawless fame will get dislodged from their seat of distinction, if they do not turn their minds towards God in grateful acknowledgement of His gifts. But those who laud the Lord’s glory and recite His holy names are bound to enjoy the perennial bliss of eternal service unto the Lord, even as Ādi-Śeṣa does. The Lord will also cling fast to such devotees even as He clings to Ādiśeṣa.




## 4.1.9
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

படி மன்னு பல் கலன் பற்றோடு அறுத்து ஐம்புலன் வென்று,  
செடி மன்னு காயம் செற்றார்களும் ஆங்கு அவனை இல்லார்,  
குடி மன்னும் இன் சுவர்க்கம் எய்தியும் மீள்வர்கள் மீள்வு இல்லை,  
கொடி மன்னு புள் உடை அண்ணல் கழல்கள் குறுகுமினோ.

paṭi maṉṉu pal kalaṉ paṟṟōṭu aṟuttu aimpulaṉ veṉṟu,  
ceṭi maṉṉu kāyam ceṟṟārkaḷum āṅku avaṉai illār,  
kuṭi maṉṉum iṉ cuvarkkam eytiyum mīḷvarkaḷ mīḷvu illai,  
koṭi maṉṉu puḷ uṭai aṇṇal kaḻalkaḷ kuṟukumiṉō.

**English translation of verse 4.1.9:**

Even they that do wealth hereditary renounce  
And conquer the senses five, doing hard penance,  
With aversion great for this body, gross and dense,  
Will but reach the pleasant Svarga and be hurled thence  
Back to Earth; better attain the feet of the Lord  
Who has, on His banner, that bird (Garuḍa)  
And enjoy the bliss that forever lasts.

**Note**

In the preceding stanzas, the Āḻvār deprecated the earthly pleasures. And now, he points out that the ‘Svarga’, the fairy land known for its unmixed pleasures attained through rigorous penance., abjuring the wealth and bodily pleasures over here, is not hospitable enough to provide these men asylum for all time. They are literally hurled down to Earth at the end of the allotted tenure of their stay in Svarga (Bhagavad Gītā-IX 21). If only these practicants had sought the Lord’s grace instead, they would have been better off, enjoying the bliss of eternal service unto Him in the same way as Garuḍa. the Lord’s proximate attendant, does.




## 4.1.10
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

குறுக மிக உணர்வத்தொடு நோக்கி எல்லாம்விட்ட,  
இறுகல் இறப்பு என்னும் ஞானிக்கும் அப் பயன் இல்லையேல்,  
சிறுக நினைவது ஓர் பாசம் உண்டாம் பின்னும் வீடு இல்லை,  
மறுகல் இல் ஈசனைப் பற்றி விடாவிடில் வீடு அஃதே.

kuṟuka mika uṇarvattoṭu nōkki ellāmviṭṭa,  
iṟukal iṟappu eṉṉum ñāṉikkum ap payaṉ illaiyēl,  
ciṟuka niṉaivatu ōr pācam uṇṭām piṉṉum vīṭu illai,  
maṟukal il īcaṉaip paṟṟi viṭāviṭil vīṭu aḵtē.

**English translation of verse 4.1.10:**

Even the gnostic who, thro’ many an austerity, strives  
For mere emancipation from rebirth and remains shut unto service divine,  
Shall be, by petty desires, impediments to his goal beset  
Or shall in self-enjoyment be for ever lost;  
Better seek, therefore, refuge in the immaculate Lord  
And reap the bliss supreme that does for ever last.

**Note**

The Āḻvār exhorts people to give up striving after ‘Kaivalya Mokṣa’, even though it is everlasting, unlike the limited stay in Svarga and seek, instead, the Supreme bliss of eternal service unto the Lord, as enunciated in the opening stanza of this decad. The ‘Kaivalya Niṣṭa’ subjects himself to an extremely rigorous course of mental and physical discipline in his attempt to perceive the Soul within and hold an exclusive rapport with it. In the process, he studiously eschews all other values of life and it is indeed most unfortunate that this exclusiveness even goes as far as keeping him away from God-consciousness and God-love. Thus, devoid of Divine grace, these people run the risk of not attaining their cherished goal of self-realisation, getting tainted by some petty desires lurking in remote corner of their minds during the last moments of their lives, which will put them back into the vicious cycle of birth and death as in the case of Ādi-Bharata (Jaḍabharata) who got distracted by tender solicitude for his pet deer at the crucial moment.




## 4.1.11
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அஃதே உய்யப் புகும் ஆறு என்று கண்ணன் கழல்கள் மேல்,  
கொய் பூம் பொழில்சூழ் குருகூர்ச் சடகோபன் குற்றேவல்,  
செய் கோலத்து ஆயிரம் சீர்த்தொடைப் பாடல் இவைபத்தும்,  
அஃகாமல் கற்பவர் ஆழ் துயர் போய் உய்யற்பாலரே.

aḵtē uyyap pukum āṟu eṉṟu kaṇṇaṉ kaḻalkaḷ mēl,

cey kōlattu āyiram cīrttoṭaip pāṭal ivaipattum,  
aḵkāmal kaṟpavar āḻ tuyar pōy uyyaṟpālarē.

**English translation of verse 4.1.11:**

Those that learn well these songs ten  
Out of the thousand composed by Kurukūr Caṭakōpaṉ,  
Chaste and elegant, stressing that salvation  
Lies in adoring lord Tirunāraṇaṉ’s feet and there alone,  
Will from deep distress be relieved and salvation attain.

**Notes**

\(i\) The Āḻvār ends up this decad, just as he began it, by stressing the importance of taking refuge at Śrīman Nārāyaṇa’s lotus feet which dispel our distress and elevate us unto Him.

\(ii\) *Chaste and elegant*: The chastity of Tiruvāymoḻi as a composition, lies in the fact that it has been compiled by the Āḻvār in a spirit of Divine Service with supreme dedication. Again, ‘Tiruvāymoḻi,’ as the Dramiḍa Veda, does not lag behind its Counterpart, the Sanskrit Vedas, in elegance and literary embellishments. The former has all the facets and ingredients corresponding to those of the latter.

\(iii\) *Deep distress*: The dire distress resuming from hankering after material wealth, ‘Kaivalya Mokṣa’ etc.; relief from distress would, in this context, mean abstinence from all else but exclusive devotion to the Lord.
