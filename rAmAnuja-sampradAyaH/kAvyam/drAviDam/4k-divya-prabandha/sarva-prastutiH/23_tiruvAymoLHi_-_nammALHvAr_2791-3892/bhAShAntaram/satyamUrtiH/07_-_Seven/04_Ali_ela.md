## 00 Intro7.4
Just when the Nāyakī was attempting to go to Tiruppēreyil where the Lord had gone for game-hunting, He returned victorious, like Śrī Rāma back home from exile, after vanquishing Rāvaṇa and his formidable horde of Rākṣasas. It may be recalled that Sītā locked Śrī Rāma in her sweet embrace by way of nursing wounds on His person after His remarkable victory over Kara, Dhūṣaṇa, Triśiras and the fourteen thousand Rākṣasas under them, singlehanded and in an amazingly short space of time. Even so, Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī, exceedingly jubilant over the Lord’s quick return from His victorious hunting expedition, gets locked up in His sweet embrace, by way of relieving His fatigue. In her festive mood, she also goes on recounting the Lord’s wondrous deeds and benefaction, vast and varied, as set out in this decad, exclaiming, “What a marvel!” “what a wonder!” and so on.

(Āṟāyirappaṭi Commentary)




## 7.4.1
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஆழிஎழ சங்கும் வில்லும்எழ, திசை  
வாழிஎழ தண்டும் வாளும்எழ, அண்டம்  
மோழைஎழ முடி பாதம்எழ, அப்பன்  
ஊழிஎழ உலகம் கொண்டவாறே (2)

āḻieḻa caṅkum villumeḻa, ticai  
vāḻieḻa taṇṭum vāḷumeḻa, aṇṭam  
mōḻaieḻa muṭi pātameḻa, appaṉ  
ūḻieḻa ulakam koṇṭavāṟē (2)

**English translation of verse 7.4.1:**

Oh, how wonderful! the way the Benefactor great spanned the worlds,  
The discus, first to grow tall like unto the Lord,  
Was by the conch, bow, mace and sword followed;  
Benedictory shouts from all directions went up,  
The massive globe got pierced and bubbling came up  
Peripheral waters, the Lord’s crown and feet moving up,  
And for Devas, the good days showed themselves up.

**Note**

The breath-taking expansion of the Lord as Trivikrama, spanning the entire Universe, up and below, is mentioned first. When the King embarks on a mighty undertaking, his immediate attendants vie with each other in exhibiting their eagerness to ensure its successful achievement. When Rāma set out on exile, Lakṣmaṇa was the first to step forward to accompany Him. Likewise, when the Lord started expanding upward, His discus, the principal weapon, was the first to expand, the other weapons following suit. In Śrī Nampiḷḷai’s unique way of putting things, the discus coolly stuck to the Lord’s hand so that when the Lord rose high up, it could automatically go up; actually, the amazing rapidity with which the Lord rose up made the discus sceptical of keeping pace with the Lord through its own effort and hence this device. The luminous discus shone with extra brilliance while the conch bellowed forth, striking terror in the hearts of the ungodly. The discus has always had a dominant role to play in all the Avatāras of the Lord. During His advent as Rāma, the aura of the discus permeated the bow, the same aura charged itself into the bent tooth, long and protruding, of the great Boar (varāha), into Narasiṃha’s nails and Paraśu Rāma’s axe. It was the discus that spoilt the eye of Śukrācārya, the high priest of the Asuras, assuming the shape of the twisted grass in Vāmana’s finger. Ever sharp, the alert discus would dart forth from the Lord’s hand and instantly hit the target, the Lord wishes to attack, the moment He thinks of it. (Śudarśana śatakam)  
Iṉ this marvellous expansion, the Lord’s crown and feet seemed to rise together. With the ascent of the Lord and His appendages, in this manner, the good days were also coming up for the down-trodden Devas. The entire scene is presented by the Āḻvār, as if it was a contemporaneous event televised.




## 7.4.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஆறு மலைக்கு எதிர்ந்துஓடும் ஒலி, அரவு  
ஊறு சுலாய் மலை தேய்க்கும் ஒலி, கடல்  
மாறு சுழன்று அழைக்கின்ற ஒலி, அப்பன்  
சாறுபட அமுதம்கொண்ட நான்றே.

āṟu malaikku etirntuōṭum oli, aravu  
ūṟu culāy malai tēykkum oli, kaṭal  
māṟu cuḻaṉṟu aḻaikkiṉṟa oli, appaṉ  
cāṟupaṭa amutamkoṇṭa nāṉṟē.

**English translation of verse 7.4.2:**

During the festive days when the great Sire for Devas gave  
The nectar from the ocean churned, the great noise came  
Of rivers bound for the ocean running back to the mountains,  
Of the mighty snake rustling round the gigantic mountain  
And of the oceanic water whirling round and round.

**Notes:**

When the momentous churning of the Milk-ocean took place, so great was the upheaval of the ocean that the rivers bound for the ocean were repulsed so fast that they had to swirl back to the mountains whence they sprang. And then, there was the mighty serpent, Vāsukī functioning as the rope churning the great mountain, making all the noise that the tremendous friction could produce; and to cap it all was the roaring of the oceanic water whirling with great momentum. What an astounding scene indeed! It is even more astonishing that the Āḻvār could visualise it in such graphic details at this distance of time. As already mentioned elsewhere, the Lord assumed multifarious roles in this breath-taking project.




## 7.4.3
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நான்றிலஏழ் மண்ணும் தானத்தவே, பின்னும்  
நான்றில ஏழ் மலை தானத்தவே, பின்னும்  
நான்றில ஏழ் கடல் தானத்தவே, அப்பன்  
ஊன்றி இடந்து எயிற்றில் கொண்ட நாளே.

nāṉṟilaēḻ maṇṇum tāṉattavē, piṉṉum  
nāṉṟila ēḻ malai tāṉattavē, piṉṉum  
nāṉṟila ēḻ kaṭal tāṉattavē, appaṉ  
ūṉṟi iṭantu eyiṟṟil koṇṭa nāḷē.

**English translation of verse 7.4.3:**

Oh, what a wonder! when the Lord pulled the Earth out  
With His tooth unique from under the waters deep,  
The islands seven didn’t from erstwhile positions slip,  
The mountains seven were as they had been and didn’t tilt,  
And again, the oceans seven didn’t burst and were *in tact*.

**Notes:**

The Lord incarnated as the Great Boar, slew the demon Hiraṇyākṣa (the golden-eyed) in a pitched battle, and forked the Earth, hidden by him under the waters, with His unique tooth, long and portruding. When the Lord put the Earth back in position, all its contents, namely, the seven islands, the seven mountains and seven oceans were quite *in tact*, without undergoing any change whatever. This is indeed characteristic of the Omnipotent Lord. The inhabitants also continued to jog on as before, running after food and raiment, unmindful of the herculean tasks performed by the Lord. This is yet another wonder indeed!




## 7.4.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நாளும்எழ நிலம் நீரும்எழ விண்ணும்  
கோளும்எழ எரி காலும்எழ, மலை  
தாளும்எழ சுடர் தானும்எழ, அப்பன்  
ஊளிஎழ உலகம்உண்ட ஊணே

nāḷumeḻa nilam nīrumeḻa viṇṇum  
kōḷumeḻa eri kālumeḻa, malai  
tāḷumeḻa cuṭar tāṉumeḻa, appaṉ  
ūḷieḻa ulakamuṇṭa ūṇē

**English translation of verse 7.4.4:**

Oh, how wonderful! the Lord did during deluge sustain  
In His stomach which with noise great sucked in  
The worlds seven, the sky and the planets tumbling down.  
Land and water got uprooted and Time ceased to function.  
The wind and fire, the mountains seven,  
The stars and other luminaries fell off their position.

**Notes:**

This song brings out the extraordinary situation that prevailed at the time of the deluge when all the elements, Sky and Earth, the Sun, Stars and other luminous bodies fell from their respective positions and moved into the Lord’s stomach, literally sucked in, to avoid being swept off. When the Sun, the chief indicater of time and its numerous components got dislodged, Time automatically ceased to function. Here then is a state of terrible impasse but all things are quite safe inside the Lord’s stomach. Oh, what a miracle!




## 7.4.5
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஊணுடை மல்லர் ததர்ந்த ஒலி, மன்னர்  
ஆண்உடைச் சேனை நடுங்கும் ஒலி, விண்ணுள்  
ஏண்உடைத் தேவர் வெளிப்பட்ட ஒலி, அப்பன்  
காணுடைப் பாரதம் கைஅறை போழ்தே

ūṇuṭai mallar tatarnta oli, maṉṉar  
āṇuṭaic cēṉai naṭuṅkum oli, viṇṇuḷ  
ēṇuṭait tēvar veḷippaṭṭa oli, appaṉ  
kāṇuṭaip pāratam kaiaṟai pōḻtē

**English translation of verse 7.4.5:**

When (Kṛṣṇa) my Sire did the armies assemble  
For the wondrous battle of Bhārata where did scream and tremble  
Kings and warriors great and wrestlers fat and strong, fell,  
Clashing with noise great and the exalted Celestials,  
Gathered in outer space, did with great wonder bubble.

**Notes:**

On seeing Lord Kṛṣṇa, the Divine Charioteer, ranged on the side of the Pāṇḍavas, Kings and Warriors of great prowess, arrayed opposite, screamed and trembled. The exalted Celestials came in their strength and watched from above, bubbling with reverent admiration, the wondrous battle down below, whose strategy was directed by the Lord at every turn, culminating in the victory of the Pāṇḍavas.




## 7.4.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

போழ்து மெலிந்த புன் செக்கரில், வான்திசை  
சூழும் எழுந்து உதிரப்புனலா, மலை  
கீழ்து பிளந்த சிங்கம்ஒத்ததால், அப்பன்  
ஆழ்துயர் செய்து அசுரரைக் கொல்லுமாறே.

pōḻtu melinta puṉ cekkaril, vāṉticai  
cūḻum eḻuntu utirappuṉalā, malai  
kīḻtu piḷanta ciṅkamottatāl, appaṉ  
āḻtuyar ceytu acuraraik kollumāṟē.

**English translation of verse 7.4.6:**

Oh, what a wonder! the way the demon (Hiraṇya) was by my Sire slain;  
Right at dusk, like a lion standing over a mountain lain  
Down below and cleaving it, splashing blood in all directions  
And high up in the sky, turning it all crimson.

**Notes:**

Oh, what a thrilling spectacle it was, the way Narasiṃham slew Hiraṇya, like unto one mountain cleaving another lain, down below, blood flooding all over, high and low! Isn’t it strange that the blood should flow, in all directions, including the sky, like water flooding low-lying areas?




## 7.4.7
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மாறு நிரைத்து இரைக்கும் சரங்கள், இன  
நூறு பிணம் மலை போல் புரள, கடல்  
ஆறு மடுத்து உதிரப்புனலா, அப்பன்  
நீறுபட இலங்கை செற்ற நேரே

māṟu niraittu iraikkum caraṅkaḷ, iṉa  
nūṟu piṇam malai pōl puraḷa, kaṭal  
āṟu maṭuttu utirappuṉalā, appaṉ  
nīṟupaṭa ilaṅkai ceṟṟa nērē

**English translation of verse 7.4.7:**

Hundreds of corpses (of the Rākṣasas) were felled down  
Like mountains huge, by noisy arrows darting in succession.  
Filling with blood the ocean and thence into the rivers overflown,  
This is how the great Sire (Rāma) did Laṅkā burn down.

**Notes:**

Oh, what a grand imagery! The blood of the Rākṣasas, rolling down dead in large numbers, fills the ocean and overflows into the rivers pushing the waters back. Lord Rāma’s arrows reduced Rāvaṇa’s Laṅka to ashes, a veritable grave-yard. The arrows sped in different directions, clashing with each other, roaring like the sea.




## 7.4.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நேர்சரிந்தான் கொடிக் கோழிகொண்டான், பின்னும்  
நேர்சரிந்தான் எரியும் அனலோன், பின்னும்  
நேர்சரிந்தான் முக்கண் மூர்த்திகண்டீர், அப்பன்  
நேர்சரி வாணன் திண்தோள் கொண்ட அன்றே

nērcarintāṉ koṭik kōḻikoṇṭāṉ, piṉṉum  
nērcarintāṉ eriyum aṉalōṉ, piṉṉum  
nērcarintāṉ mukkaṇ mūrttikaṇṭīr, appaṉ  
nērcari vāṇaṉ tiṇtōḷ koṇṭa aṉṟē

**English translation of verse 7.4.8:**

When Kṛṣṇa, my Sire, did chop off the mighty arms  
Of the retreating vāṇaṉ the one with peacock banner  
Had to give way and so did the one (Agni) that beams,  
The triple-eyed (Rudra) too beat a retreat, in like manner.

**Notes:**

Kṛṣṇa’s encounter with Vāṇaṉ (Bāṇāsura) and his allies has already been set out, in detail, in the notes under III-10-4. Subrahmaṇya, Son of Śiva, is referred to here as the one with peacock banner. Agni, the fire-god, flaunted all his forty-nine facets, in vain; he had to cut a sorry figure, like his compatriots, before Lord Kṛṣṇā.




## 7.4.9
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அன்றுமண் நீர்எரிகால் விண் மலைமுதல்,  
அன்று சுடர் இரண்டு பிறவும், பின்னும்  
அன்று மழை உயிர் தேவும் மற்றும், அப்பன்  
அன்று முதல் உலகம் செய்ததுமே

aṉṟumaṇ nīrerikāl viṇ malaimutal,  
aṉṟu cuṭar iraṇṭu piṟavum, piṉṉum  
aṉṟu maḻai uyir tēvum maṟṟum, appaṉ  
aṉṟu mutal ulakam ceytatumē

**English translation of verse 7.4.9:**

When the Lord first created the worlds,  
The elements five, the mountains and other things were ushered.  
All at once and so were the Sun, Moon and Stars,  
That very moment came up the clouds that shower  
Rains and the lives they sustain, all things still and mobile.  
And the minor deities, oh, what a marvel!

**Notes:**

This song could refer either to the initial creation of the worlds with their diverse contents as one of His great achievements or be treated as a follow-up of the preceding song, dealing with the subjugation of Bāṇāsura by Lord Kṛṣṇa. The Lord’s creation became worth its while, only when He subdued Bāṇāsura and quelled his hauteur galore, cropprotection does indeed form an integral part of crop-cultivation.




## 7.4.10
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மேய்நிரை கீழ்புக மாபுரள, சுனை  
வாய்நிறை நீர் பிளிறிச்சொரிய, இன  
ஆநிரை பாடி அங்கேஒடுங்க, அப்பன்  
தீமழை காத்து குன்றம் எடுத்தானே

mēynirai kīḻpuka māpuraḷa, cuṉai  
vāyniṟai nīr piḷiṟiccoriya, iṉa  
ānirai pāṭi aṅkēoṭuṅka, appaṉ  
tīmaḻai kāttu kuṉṟam eṭuttāṉē

**English translation of verse 7.4.10:**

When (Kṛṣṇa) my Sire, held the umbrella of a mountain  
And warded off (Indra’s) rain of destruction,  
The whole of Āyppāṭi, the town fertile, remained under its protection,  
The grazing cattle just moved aside and carried on,  
The beasts tumbled as the mount was held upside down  
And water from tankṣ, full to the brim, came gushing down.

**Notes:**

Here is a short and sweet picture, graphic enough, of Lord Kṛṣṇa’s mountain-lifting to protect a whole township and its cattle from the fury of Indra, which visited on them through a heavy down-pour of revengeful rains for a whole week. While the cattle grazed on undisturbed, moving a little down on the mountain slopes, the wild animals, caught unawares, tumbled down, as Śrī Kṛṣṇa held Mount Govardan upside down, like holding an umbrella. Again, the tanks on the mountain slopes, full to the brim, got inverted and the waters discharged therefrom came down with roaring noise, like unto rain-fall from numerous belts, the phenomenon of a multiplicity of rains raised in the process of shielding the township from a single rain visited by the irate Indra. How magnanimous indeed of the Lord to have patiently held aloft a mountain for a whole week and spared Indra, a votary of His (unlike the inimical Asuras), despite the wrong done by him!




## 7.4.11
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

குன்றம் எடுத்தபிரான் அடியாரொடும்,  
ஒன்றிநின்ற சடகோபன்உரைசெயல்,  
நன்றி புனைந்த ஓர்ஆயிரத்துள் இவை  
வென்றி தரும்பத்தும் மேவிக் கற்பார்க்கே (2)

kuṉṟam eṭuttapirāṉ aṭiyāroṭum,  
oṉṟiniṉṟa caṭakōpaṉuraiceyal,  
naṉṟi puṉainta ōrāyirattuḷ ivai  
veṉṟi tarumpattum mēvik kaṟpārkkē (2)

**English translation of verse 7.4.11:**

Success in many ways will these ten beneficent songs confer  
On those that learn them, out of the thousand composed  
By Caṭakōpaṉ who did unto the devotees adhere  
Of the Benefactor great, Who aloft did mount Govardan hold.

**Notes:**

The Āḻvār feels as if he is one of those who took shelter under mount Govardan, when Lord Kṛṣṇa held it aloft. It could also be interpreted as his joining the rank and file of the Śrī Vaiṣṇavas, who have sought refuge at the Lord’s feet, scared of the worldly life, like unto those in the pastoral village, who took shelter under Govardan. As Nampiḷḷai puts it, the Āḻvār feels drawn towards the Lord’s remarkable simplicity in holding aloft Govardan for a whole week and His exquisite charm in that position. And so, he gives vent to his Joy by mentally mingling with those who were then under the Lord’s protective umbrella. Surely, the chanters of this decad which sets out, one by one, the Lord’s victorious achievements, will be crowned with success in all their undertakings.
