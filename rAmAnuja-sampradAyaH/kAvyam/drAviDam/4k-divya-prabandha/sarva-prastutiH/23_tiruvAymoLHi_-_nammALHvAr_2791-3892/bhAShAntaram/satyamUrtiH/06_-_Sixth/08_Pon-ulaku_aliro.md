## 00 Intro6.8
This is yet another decad, where the Āḻvār sends messages to the Lord through birds, bees etc, the two earlier ones being I-4 and VI-1. This is the third such decad and the fourth and the last decad of this kind is IX-7, The technique, in this regard, having been already elucidated in the preamble to I-4, it would suffice if the distinguishing feature of this decad is brought out, namely, the message is now sent to the Lord in His ‘Para’ or transcendent and ‘Antaryāmi’ or hidden Form, as Internal Controller of all, as could be gathered mainly from Stanzas 4 and 5 of this decad. It may be recalled that the messages in I-4 and VI-1 were conveyed to the Lord in His ‘Vyuha’ and ‘Vibhava’ aspects, respectively.

The Nāyakī, who set out for the coveted Tirukkōḷūr, couldn’t reach the place; as apprehended by her mother, she got bogged down *en route*, due to her intense God-love and, stranded half way through, she sends the messages, as in this decad. The trait of the Lord, invoked by the Nāyakī, is ‘compassion’ as Piḷḷāṉ would put it, as could also be seen from the oft-repeated rerain of the songs, in this decad. According to Śrī Parāśara Bhaṭṭar, the Lord’s feeling of oneness with His devotees (aikarasya), His sense of identity with them, is invoked, vide the sixth stanza.




## 6.8.1
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

பொன் உலகு ஆளீரோ? புவனி முழுது ஆளீரோ?,  
நல் நலப் புள்ளினங்காள்! வினையாட்டியேன் நான் இரந்தேன்,  
முன் உலகங்கள் எல்லாம் படைத்த முகில்வண்ணன் கண்ணன்,  
என் நலம் கொண்ட பிரான் தனக்கு என் நிலைமை உரைத்தே?.

poṉ ulaku āḷīrō? puvaṉi muḻutu āḷīrō?,  
nal nalap puḷḷiṉaṅkāḷ! viṉaiyāṭṭiyēṉ nāṉ irantēṉ,  
muṉ ulakaṅkaḷ ellām paṭaitta mukilvaṇṇaṉ kaṇṇaṉ,  
eṉ nalam koṇṭa pirāṉ taṉakku eṉ nilaimai uraittē?.

**English translation of verse 6.8.1:**

Ye, birds of manners good, this sinner does entreat  
That you should unto the cloud-hued Lord, Who did create  
The worlds, the Benefactor, Who in me instilled love so great,  
Report my condition; I will then unto you grant  
The right to rule the entire Earth and Heaven grand.

### Notes

\(i\) Two special points are made out, in this song. No reward is too great for those who mediate between us and God, not even the Earth and Heaven, put together. Therefore it is, aphorism 432 of ‘Śrī Vacaṉa Bhūṣaṇa’ avers that it would be possible to recompense theĀcāryā, in an adequate measure only if there were four vibhūtīs and two Gods. The idea is that any reward, short of both the worlds (the Nitya Vibhūti or the Eternal Land and the Līlā vibhūti or the sportive Universe) and God Himself, will be inadequate and, in order to make a suitable reward, two sets of each would be necessary, an obvious impossibility.

\(ii\) Again, the Āḻvrā’s greatness is such that he has the power to grant to whomsoever he wishes, sovereignty over Earth and Heaven. God’s love for the Saints is so great that they are endowed with the Lord’s own powers, in this respect. Only a superficial observer, who is just puzzled over the Āḻvār falling at the feet of birds and bees to carry his message to the Lord, will question the Āḻvār’s competence, as above. The questioner will do well to realise that the Āḻvār has been deliberately kept on, in this world, by the munificent Lord, so as to bequeath to His devotees, the nectarean hymns to subsist on. The Lord is indeed so pliable unto the Āḻvār that He unreservedly places Himself and all His possessions at his disposal. The messages, such as those featured in this decad, are but facets of the Āḻvār’s God-love of matchless intensity.

\(iii\) Tradition has it that Aruḷāḷapperumāḷ Emperumāṉār (a disciple of Śrī Rāmānuja) made a request to Kūrattaḷvāṉ (an intimate disciple of Rāmānuja) to plead with Lord Raṅganātha to take the former to Heaven. Instances of this kind could easily be multiplied.




## 6.8.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மையமர் வாள் நெடும்கண் மங்கைமார் முன்பு என் கை இருந்து,  
நெய்யமர் இன் அடிசில் நிச்சல் பாலொடு மேவீரோ,  
கையமர் சக்கரத்து என் கனிவாய்ப் பெருமானைக் கண்டு  
மெய்யமர் காதல் சொல்லி கிளிகாள்! விரைந்து ஓடிவந்தே?

maiyamar vāḷ neṭumkaṇ maṅkaimār muṉpu eṉ kai iruntu,  
neyyamar iṉ aṭicil niccal pāloṭu mēvīrō,  
kaiyamar cakkarattu eṉ kaṉivāyp perumāṉaik kaṇṭu  
meyyamar kātal colli kiḷikāḷ! viraintu ōṭivantē?

**English translation of verse 6.8.2:**

Ye. parrots, meet you should my red-lipped Lord,  
Holding the discus and convey my desire to get locked  
In His sweet embrace; come back quick and daily take  
In my hand perched, porridge sweet, mixed with ghee and milk,  
In front of the mates with long, lovely eyes with collyrium treated.

### Note

Having offered both Heaven and Earth to her emissaries, in the last song, the Nāyakī now offers to give her very self unto them, a more precious gift, coveted by the Lord Himself and that too, not secretly, but in front of all her mates. It is noteworthy that the Nāyaki indicates beforehand how she would reward her emissaries. The accent thus ultimately rests on service unto the Lord’s devotees.




## 6.8.3
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஓடிவந்து என் குழல்மேல் ஒளிமாமலர் ஊதீரோ,  
கூடிய வண்டினங்காள்! குருநாடு உடை ஐவர்கட்கு ஆய்  
ஆடிய மா நெடும் தேர்ப்படை நீறு எழச் செற்ற பிரான்,  
சூடிய தண் துளவம் உண்ட தூமது வாய்கள் கொண்டே?

ōṭivantu eṉ kuḻalmēl oḷimāmalar ūtīrō,  
kūṭiya vaṇṭiṉaṅkāḷ! kurunāṭu uṭai aivarkaṭku āy  
āṭiya mā neṭum tērppaṭai nīṟu eḻac ceṟṟa pirāṉ,  
cūṭiya taṇ tuḷavam uṇṭa tūmatu vāykaḷ koṇṭē?

**English translation of verse 6.8.3:**

Ye, jolly swarm of bees, better go and suck the honey  
From the cool tuḷaci on the locks of my Lord,  
Who to pieces got smashed steeds fine and chariots large  
And victory won for the five of them (Pāṇḍavas), come back quickly  
And, amid the flowers bright, on my hair make merry.

**Note**

Here is a case of collective bargaining by a swarm of bees, on behalf of the Nāyakī. And when they come back with their mouths, soaked in honey from the Lord’s locks, they could jolly well play right on the Nāyakī’s head and thus indirectly feed her with the Lord’s honey.




## 6.8.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

தூமதுவாய்கள் கொண்டுவந்து என் முல்லைகள்மேல் தும்பிகாள்,  
பூ மது உண்ணச் செல்லில் வினையேனைப் பொய்செய்து அகன்ற,  
மாமதுவார் தண்துழாய்முடி வானவர் கோனைக் கண்டு,  
யாம் இதுவோ தக்கவாறு என்னவேண்டும் கண்டீர் நுங்கட்கே.

tūmatuvāykaḷ koṇṭuvantu eṉ mullaikaḷmēl tumpikāḷ,  
pū matu uṇṇac cellil viṉaiyēṉaip poyceytu akaṉṟa,  
māmatuvār taṇtuḻāymuṭi vāṉavar kōṉaik kaṇṭu,  
yām ituvō takkavāṟu eṉṉavēṇṭum kaṇṭīr nuṅkaṭkē.

**English translation of verse 6.8.4:**

Ye, beetles sweet lurking in Jasmine flowers by me reared,  
When next in search of honey you go, meet the Lord  
Of the Celestials in Heaven, sporting cool tuḷaci garland  
On His crown, Who with this sinner freely mingled,  
As in a dream and left, and say ‘tis hardly meet  
That He should unto sovereignty stick and from me depart.

### Notes

\(i\) The beetles, ever in quest of honey, are directed by the Nāyakī to the Lord in Heaven, on whose crown is honey-studded tuḷaci, garland, so as to gather the honey therefrom and incidentally tell the Lord that He should not keep aloof from her, at that distance, gloating over His transcendent glory. It is through such mediation by the God’s chosen few, His detachment from us is changed into attachment.

\(ii\) The creatures were languishing without honey, as the flowers on the Nāyakī’s locks as well as the surrounding gardens had all dried up, due to her separation from the Lord. And so, the Nāyakī directs them to the Lord in Heaven, sporting tuḷaci garlands, studded with honey.

\(iii\) Lest the Nāyakī should collapse, if ever she got scent of her impending separation from the Lord, He was telling her, during their erstwhile rapport, that He would never part from her. The Nāyakī takes the blame on herself that it is her sin that made even the truthful Lord utter lies, in this manner, during their erstwhile rapport.




## 6.8.5
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நுங்கட்கு யான் உரைக்கேன் வம்மின் யான் வளர்த்த கிளிகாள்,  
வெம் கண் புள் ஊர்ந்து வந்து வினையேனை நெஞ்சம் கவர்ந்த  
செங்கண் கருமுகிலை செய்ய வாய்ச் செழுங் கற்பகத்தை,  
எங்குச் சென்றாகிலும் கண்டு இதுவோ தக்கவாறு என்மினே.

nuṅkaṭku yāṉ uraikkēṉ vammiṉ yāṉ vaḷartta kiḷikāḷ,  
vem kaṇ puḷ ūrntu vantu viṉaiyēṉai neñcam kavarnta  
ceṅkaṇ karumukilai ceyya vāyc ceḻuṅ kaṟpakattai,  
eṅkuc ceṉṟākilum kaṇṭu ituvō takkavāṟu eṉmiṉē.

**English translation of verse 6.8.5:**

Come here, ye, my pet parrots, let me unto you tell,  
*Be it anywhere*, You have to go and meet the cloud-hued Lord,  
The lotus-eyed, the wish-yielding tree, unique, mounted on the hot-eyed bird,  
Who unto me came and stole this sinner’s heart; Him do tell,  
‘Tis not meet that He should from me be apart.

### Notes

\(i\) *Be it anywhere*: Go and ferret Him out, wherever He might be hiding, even as Hanumān solemnly resolved that he shall go to swarga [svarga] and find out Sītā even if he couldn’t locate her in Laṅkā. It is this phrase that gives the clue for the interpretation that this song deals with the ‘Antaryāmi’ (hidden or all-pervading) aspect of the Lord, as well.

\(ii\) *Unique wish—yielding tree*: What indeed makes the Lord unique, as distinguished from the legendary ‘Kaṟpaka’ tree, has been set out admirably in Īṭu commentary; The classical tree can only grant the wish of others; it has no wish of its own nor can it make over itself to others. But the Lord can and does, of His own will, give Himself over to His devotees. The Nāyakī feels that the Lord has gifted away to her both His vibhūtīs (the Eternal land and the sportive universe), in such a manner that she could, in turn, gift them away to any one of her choice.

\(iii\) The hot-eyed bird, referred to, in this song, is Garuḍa who frowns on the ungodly and blisters them with his looks.




## 6.8.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

என் மின்னு நூல் மார்வன் என் கரும் பெருமான் என் கண்ணன்,  
தன் மன்னு நீள் கழல்மேல் தண் துழாய் நமக்கு அன்றி நல்கான்,  
கல்மின்கள் என்று உம்மையான் கற்பியாவைத்த மாற்றம்சொல்லி,  
செல்மின்கள் தீவினையேன் வளர்த்த சிறு பூவைகளே!

eṉ miṉṉu nūl mārvaṉ eṉ karum perumāṉ eṉ kaṇṇaṉ,  
taṉ maṉṉu nīḷ kaḻalmēl taṇ tuḻāy namakku aṉṟi nalkāṉ,  
kalmiṉkaḷ eṉṟu ummaiyāṉ kaṟpiyāvaitta māṟṟamcolli,  
celmiṉkaḷ tīviṉaiyēṉ vaḷartta ciṟu pūvaikaḷē!

**English translation of verse 6.8.6:**

Ye, little Pūvai birds, by this feli sinner reared,  
Go unto my dark-hued Kaṇṇaṉ with shining sacred thread  
On His winsome chest which unto me He once gave,  
Sweet and docile, He will to none but us give  
The cool tuḷaci, decorating His feet long; unto Him recite  
The hymns I have taught, remembering them quite *in tact*.

### Notes

\(i\) The little Pūvai birds, commissioned by the Nāyakī to carry her message to the Supreme Lord, were naturally diffident about getting the Lord’s attention. The Nāyakī, therefore, enthuses them by saying that the Lord, who had enticed her by His sweet decorations, exquisite Form and amazing simplicity, would surely give unto His devotees, the tuḷaci worn on His feet. As a matter of fact, the sacred basil is worn by the Lord on His shoulders and chest, crown and feet and yet, the devotees specially long for the tuḷaci, worn on the Lord’s lovely feet, their safe haven. The Lord, who completely identified Himself with His devotees, would give the tuḷaci on His feet to none but them.

\(ii\) *This fell Sinner*: The Nāyakī says this, in her state of separation from the Lord, rather feels vexed at that she has to take work from her pets, instead of fondling them in the sweet company of her Lord.

\(iii\) Our great preceptors have taught the ‘Mantra Ratna’ (Dvayam) to one and all, without distinction of big and small. Likewise, the Nāyakī has taught even these little birds the truth about the Lord, how He would surely yield the tuḷaci from His feet to the aspiring devotees and that one of such great compassion could ill-afford to be away from the Nāyakī.

\(iv\) The disciples, who stood reverently at the bed-side of Saint Aruḷāḷapperumāḷ Emperumāṉār towards the fag end of his stay in this abode, found that the Saint was exercising his mind over some thing. On enquiry, they elicited, that he was meditating on how a simple bird (dove) caused grief to Lord Rāma and literally bled His heart. Vibhīṣaṇa’s admission to Śrī Rāma’s camp was hotly debated, down below, while the supplicant was anxiously poised in mid-air, having entrusted himself to His keeping. The Lord was, however, annoyed over the delay in responding to the destitute’s call, caused by such a debate and He affirmed that whosoever sought refuge in Him, be he a friend or foe, was entitled to His protection without demur. Declaring this creed, the Lord also cited the episode which won for a mere dove, deathless praise. Overcoming fear and hatred, the male dove welcomed the slayer of his mate and fed, on his own flesh, the weary fowler. Verily, this episode should have wounded the Lord’s heart sorely, when eventually He slew Rāvaṇa, who had kept Sītā in captivity. Nampiḷḷai used to give out the full import of this episode, thus: “Once we confide in the Lord and entrust ourselves to His keeping, as Vibhīṣaṇa did, this simple gesture carries us on to the very acme of spiritual eminence. After our surrender unto God, as the Sole Refuge, He puts through the process of salvation and such is His glory, perfection and grace on which we have but to implicitly rely. We don’t have to bend even a blade of grass for our salvation”.




## 6.8.7
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

பூவைகள் போல் நிறத்தன் புண்டரீகங்கள் போலும் கண்ணன்,  
யாவையும் யாவரும் ஆய் நின்ற மாயன் என் ஆழிப் பிரான்,  
மாவை வல் வாய் பிளந்த மதுசூதற்கு என் மாற்றம் சொல்லி,  
பாவைகள்! தீர்க்கிற்றிரே வினையாட்டியேன் பாசறவே.

pūvaikaḷ pōl niṟattaṉ puṇṭarīkaṅkaḷ pōlum kaṇṇaṉ,  
yāvaiyum yāvarum āy niṉṟa māyaṉ eṉ āḻip pirāṉ,  
māvai val vāy piḷanta matucūtaṟku eṉ māṟṟam colli,  
pāvaikaḷ! tīrkkiṟṟirē viṉaiyāṭṭiyēṉ pācaṟavē.

**English translation of verse 6.8.7:**

My dolls, can you my message convey  
Unto the wondrous Lord of blue tint and lotus eyes,  
Who unto me displayed His lovely discus,  
Who the forms of all things and beings acquires,  
Who slew Matu and split the mouth of a demoniac horśe,  
And this sinner’s miserable plight allay?

### Note

The Nāyakī’s plight is such that she is obliged to seek the assistance of even inanimate things like dolls; the Supreme Lord seems to be indifferent while the mobile creatures like the winged birds have their own occupations. In the last resort, she falls back upon her very playthings. The folks around question why at all she should agitate like this, when the Lord is indifferent. The Nāyakī’s answer is that she just can’t but come under His spell when she meditates on His charming complexion, bewitching eyes, auspicious traits and wondrous deeds.




## 6.8.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

பாசறவு எய்தி இன்னே வினையேன் எனை ஊழி நைவேன்?  
ஆசு அறு தூவி வெள்ளைக் குருகே! அருள்செய்து ஒருநாள்,  
மாசு அறு நீலச்சுடர்முடி வானவர் கோனைக் கண்டு,  
ஏசு அறும் நும்மை அல்லால் மறுநோக்கு இலள் பேர்த்துமற்றே.

pācaṟavu eyti iṉṉē viṉaiyēṉ eṉai ūḻi naivēṉ?  
ācu aṟu tūvi veḷḷaik kurukē! aruḷceytu orunāḷ,  
mācu aṟu nīlaccuṭarmuṭi vāṉavar kōṉaik kaṇṭu,  
ēcu aṟum nummai allāl maṟunōkku ilaḷ pērttumaṟṟē.

**English translation of verse 6.8.8:**

You, immaculate stork with flawless plumes, please spare  
A day for me, go and meet the Lord in Heaven  
With bluish locks, pure and fine, and of Him enquire  
How long this sinner should like this dwindle; tell Him, in fine  
Except His impeccable Self, refuge for me there’s none.

### Note

The Nāyakī prays to the stork, near at hand, to carry her message to the Lord of the Celestials, in Heaven and bursts into grief. She can’t articulate and spell out her woes, in detail, as both her grief and the Lord, whose separation is the cause thereof, are too deep for words.




## 6.8.9
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

பேர்த்து மற்று ஓர் களைகண் வினையாட்டியேன் நான் ஒன்று இலேன்,  
நீர்த் திரைமேல் உலவி இரை தேரும் புதா இனங்காள்  
கார்த் திரள் மா முகில் போல் கண்ணன் விண்ணவர் கோனைக் கண்டு,  
வார்த்தைகள் கொண்டு அருளி உரையீர் வைகல் வந்திருந்தே.

pērttu maṟṟu ōr kaḷaikaṇ viṉaiyāṭṭiyēṉ nāṉ oṉṟu ilēṉ,  
nīrt tiraimēl ulavi irai tērum putā iṉaṅkāḷ  
kārt tiraḷ mā mukil pōl kaṇṇaṉ viṇṇavar kōṉaik kaṇṭu,  
vārttaikaḷ koṇṭu aruḷi uraiyīr vaikal vantiruntē.

**English translation of verse 6.8.9:**

Ye, herds of herons, wading thro’ waves, in search of food,  
Other than you, this sinner has none to go and meet the Lord,  
Like unto dense rain-clouds, Chief of the Celestials  
And bring His message and recount graciously  
Unto me, sitting beside me, days on end.

### Note

These birds are commissioned by the Nāyakī to go and meet the Lord in Heaven, surrounded by Angels and regaling them (like unto rains, unleashed on the ocean instead of on the crops, withering away) and tell Him, His greatness lay not in His might and majesty in that transcendent setting but in His loving condescension unto the desolate Nāyakī who was dwindling, down below, sunk deep in dejection. And then, these birds were to bring back His message and keep recounting His words to her, sitting by her side, days on end, being the only source of sustenance for her, in the present context.




## 6.8.10
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வந்திருந்து உம்முடைய மணிச் சேவலும் நீரும் எல்லாம்,  
அந்தரம் ஒன்றும் இன்றி அலர்மேல் அசையும் அன்னங்காள்,  
என் திரு மார்வற்கு என்னை இன்னவாறு இவள் காண்மின் என்று,  
மந்திரத்து ஒன்று உணர்த்தி உரையீர் மறுமாற்றங்களே.

vantiruntu ummuṭaiya maṇic cēvalum nīrum ellām,  
antaram oṉṟum iṉṟi alarmēl acaiyum aṉṉaṅkāḷ,  
eṉ tiru mārvaṟku eṉṉai iṉṉavāṟu ivaḷ kāṇmiṉ eṉṟu,  
mantirattu oṉṟu uṇartti uraiyīr maṟumāṟṟaṅkaḷē.

**English translation of verse 6.8.10:**

Ye, swans, in front of me, gliding gaily on flowers,  
With your lovely males with no hindrance, go and tell  
The Lord bearing Tiru on His chest, when alone in His chamber,  
How I fare and unto me His reply do come and tell.

### Note

The Swans are instructed by the Nāyakī, to disclose her critical condition to the Lord, when He retires to His private chamber, on the conclusion of His Durbar, so that it can catch the attention of ‘Tiru’, Lakṣmī. the Gracious Mother, the great Intercessor between the Lord and His Subjects; The birds are to bring back the Lord’s reply, and inform the Nāyakī.




## 6.8.11
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மாற்றங்கள் ஆய்ந்துகொண்டு மதுசூத பிரான் அடிமேல்,  
நாற்றங்கொள் பூம்பொழில்சூழ் குருகூர்ச் சடகோபன் சொன்ன,  
தோற்றங்கள் ஆயிரத்துள் இவையும் ஒருபத்தும் வல்லார்  
ஊற்றின்கண் நுண் மணல்போல் உருகாநிற்பர் நீராயே.

māṟṟaṅkaḷ āyntukoṇṭu matucūta pirāṉ aṭimēl,  
nāṟṟaṅkoḷ pūmpoḻilcūḻ kurukūrc caṭakōpaṉ coṉṉa,  
tōṟṟaṅkaḷ āyirattuḷ ivaiyum orupattum vallār  
ūṟṟiṉkaṇ nuṇ maṇalpōl urukāniṟpar nīrāyē.

**English translation of verse 6.8.11:**

Those that are conversant with these songs ten.  
Out of the thousand composed in choice diction  
By Caṭakōpaṉ of Kurukūr, full of fragrant flower gardens,  
Adoring Matucūtaṉ’s lovely feet, will indeed thaw down  
Like unto the sands minute in water springs.

### Notes

\(i\) The end-song usually gives out the tangible (in concrete terms) benefit accrued by dint of learning the songs in this decad. Melting tenderness of heart is indeed a great virtue when one sees that only those with such a disposition can tread the path of Bhakti (God-love) and that is acquired by those who are conversant with this decad. Intangible though it might seem to the superficial reader, it is indeed a priceless possession worth coveting.

\(ii\) The gardens of Kurukūr are once again, in full bloom, seeing that the Nāyakī herself has derived sustenance from the certain hope that the message conveyed to the Lord in Heaven at His private chamber, will not go unheeded.
