## 00 Intro10.8
In the sixth decad of this centum, the Lord was indeed in great hurry to take the Āḻvār to Heaven but His speed got somewhat arrested, in the last decad, due to His passionate love for the Āḻvār’s physical frame as well and His resultant desire to lift him up bodily to Heaven. The Āḻvār had to do quite a bit of talking and impress upon the Lord, the non-feasibility of his ascent to Heaven, in this physical body and ultimately the Lord had to yield.

And now, when the stage is eventually set for the Āḻvār’s Heaven-bound journey, the Āḻvār intercepts and accosts the Lord as follows:

> “My Lord, how is it that You, Who are now in such great hurry to put
> me in Heaven, had coolly allowed me to drift and struggle in this land
> of dark nescience, all these days? Pray let me know what precisely are
> the underlying reasons for Your age-long indifference and Your present
> predilection.”
>
> (see the ninth song of this decad).

The Lord was quite aware that the Āḻvār, endowed by Him with knowledge full and complete, was a hard nut to crack and he could effectively counter all His arguments. He, therefore, discreetly kept silent, looking away from the Āḻvār, leaving it to the latter to conclude that it would but be futile to question the ways of the Sovereign Lord with unbridled independence. The Āḻvār was also quick to realise that the present dispensation of the Lord was but the influx of His sweet spontaneous grace, totally unrelated to the merit in him. It is this voluntary grace of the Lord that the Āḻvār dwells upon, in this decad, and rejoices.




## 10.8.1
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

திருமாலிருஞ்சோலை மலை என்றேன் என்ன  
திருமால்வந்து என்நெஞ்சு நிறையப் புகுந்தான்  
குருமா மணிஉந்து புனல் பொன்னித் தென்பால்  
திருமால்சென்று சேர்விடம் தென் திருப்பேரே. (2)

tirumāliruñcōlai malai eṉṟēṉ eṉṉa  
tirumālvantu eṉneñcu niṟaiyap pukuntāṉ  
kurumā maṇiuntu puṉal poṉṉit teṉpāl  
tirumālceṉṟu cērviṭam teṉ tiruppērē. (2)

**English translation of verse 10.8.1:**

Lovely Tiruppēr on the south bank of the river Poṉṉi,  
Whose flood waters are with costly rubies laden,  
Is the favourite resort of Tirumāl Who got into my heart  
And spread Himself out in full, when I did just articulate  
The name of Tirumāliruñcōlai, the holy Mount.

**Notes:**

The Āḻvār brings into focus, the Lord’s redemptive grace, shed on the subjects with sweet spontaniety, on the slightest pretext. There is the vicarious reward from the Lord Who treats even the casual mention, by some one, of His names and those of the pilgrim centres, without any religious fervour behind it, as a genuine exercise in chanting these names, with due reverence. The Āḻvār’s lips casually uttered the name of Mount Tirumāliruñcōlai, least aware of its special sanctity and yet, the Lord took his utterance at its face value and entered the Āḻvār’s heart. Even as water finds a small aperture enough to pass through and fill the entire area within, the cloud-hued Lord entered the Āḻvār’s body, mind and soul. So full of the Āḻvār is He now that He has literally become the Āḻvār. The Lord, who coveted the Āḻvār, to such an extent, is the One residing with Śrī Mahālakṣmī, the Divine Mother, at Tiruppēr (Appa Kuṭattāṉ) on the South bank of the river Kāvēri (also known as Poṉṉi). It is this holy conjunction of the Lord and the Divine Mother, that induced the Lord to shed His grace on the Āḻvār, in such super-abundance, overlooking the fact that his mention of the name of Mount Tirumāliruñcōlai was much-too-casual, lip-deep and no more than that.




## 10.8.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

பேரே உறைகின்ற பிரான் இன்று வந்து  
பேரேன்என்று என்நெஞ்சு நிறையப் புகுந்தான்  
கார்ஏழ் கடல்ஏழ் மலைஏழ் உலகு உண்டும்  
ஆராவயிற்றானை அடங்கப் பிடித்தேனே.

pērē uṟaikiṉṟa pirāṉ iṉṟu vantu  
pērēṉeṉṟu eṉneñcu niṟaiyap pukuntāṉ  
kārēḻ kaṭalēḻ malaiēḻ ulaku uṇṭum  
ārāvayiṟṟāṉai aṭaṅkap piṭittēṉē.

**English translation of verse 10.8.2:**

My Sire, Who does in Tiruppēr dwell, has now come  
Unto me, with delight immense and in my heart stands firm;  
His fill He hadn’t although he gulped down the clouds seven,  
The seven oceans, the seven mountains and the worlds seven,  
But now He feels full, spreading Himself out inside me.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The Supreme Lord did sustain, during the great deluge, all the worlds, with their vast contents and all beings, with no exception whatever. Even so, He did not feel full at all. This void was, of course, due to the absence of His contact with the Āḻvār and it was only to overcome this deficiency that the Lord stationed Himself along with His Divine Consort at Tiruppēr, on the south bank of the river Kāvēri, a vantage position from which He could enter the Āḻvār’s body, under the slightest pretext.

\(ii\) Even as Lakṣmī, the lotus-born, gave up the lotus flower, the seat of her birth and got Herself implanted on the Lord’s chest, repeatedly saying, “I won’t from Him be apart, even for a trice”, the Lord. Who got inside the Āḻvār’s heart, went on saying, “I won’t depart from here”, as if some one had asked Him whether He intended to stay on there or go away after a while.

\(iii\) The Lord’s entry into the Āḻvār’s body, heart and soul, gives one the impression of His full and complete pervasion of the Āḻvār but the fulness actually pertains to the Lord and it is He that has now become full.




## 10.8.3
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

பிடித்தேன் பிறவி கெடுத்தேன் பிணிசாரேன்  
மடித்தேன் மனைவாழ்க்கையுள் நிற்பதுஓர் மாயையை  
கொடிக் கோபுரமாடங்கள்சூழ் திருப்பேரான்  
அடிச்சேர்வது எனக்கு எளிதுஆயின வாறே.

piṭittēṉ piṟavi keṭuttēṉ piṇicārēṉ

koṭik kōpuramāṭaṅkaḷcūḻ tiruppērāṉ  
aṭiccērvatu eṉakku eḷituāyiṉa vāṟē.

**English translation of verse 10.8.3:**

How easily could I my Lord attain, Who dwells  
In Tiruppēr, enclosed by towers with banners aloft and castles tall!  
Firm indeed is my grip of His feet which cut out pestilence,  
My cycle of births and that elusive trap, the dark nescience.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The Āḻvār keeps musing over the manner in which the Lord has come and mingled with him, out of His spontaneous grace and wonders how the Lord became so easily accessible to him. Having got hold of the Lord’s feet, he is determined not to relax his grip over them hereafter. The benefits flowing from his attainment of the Lord’s feet are: (1) the dreadful cycle of birth and death, perpetuating his bondage, has ground to a halt; (2) with the cessation of birth, pestilence, its by-product, has also been wiped out and (3) severance of his age-long association with Māyā, the Primordial matter, which brings on the changes of state and the chain of miseries incidental thereto, keeping its victims earth-bound and sense-buried.

\(ii\) An anecdote cited, in this contest, in Īṭu Commentary, is reproduced below:

Saint Rāmānuja was having a stroll in the verandah of the mutt, just after a meal, as a constitutional exercise, but abruptly recanted without proceeding further on, as usual. This was because he was reciting this particular decad and as he dwelt on the line of this song, referring to the Āḻvār’s severance of his age-long association with ‘Māyā’ which had kept him in bondage from time immemorial, the Saint also abruptly stopped strolling on and entered the hall. Empār, the enlightened disciple, who was watching this through the small opening in the door of the hall, kept ajar, instantly sized up the situation and enquired whether the Saint was reciting, just then, this particular line and the latter affirmed it.




## 10.8.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

எளிதாயினவாறுஎன்று என்கண்கள் களிப்பக்  
களிதாகிய சிந்தையனாய்க் களிக்கின்றேன்  
கிளிதாவிய சோலைகள்சூழ் திருப்பேரான்  
தெளிதாகிய சேண்விசும்பு தருவானே.

eḷitāyiṉavāṟueṉṟu eṉkaṇkaḷ kaḷippak

kiḷitāviya cōlaikaḷcūḻ tiruppērāṉ  
teḷitākiya cēṇvicumpu taruvāṉē.

**English translation of verse 10.8.4:**

The Lord dwelling in Tiruppēr, surrounded by orchards lovely,  
The home of parrots, is on the point of bestowing on me  
The immaculate Heaven of splendour great; rejoice do my eyes  
That the high Heaven is brought by the Lord’s grace  
Within my easy reach and my mind with joy does dance.

**Notes:**

\(i\) *The home of parrots*: This refers to the lovely gardens in Tiruppēr, where parrots are perched merrily. This could also refer to the township of Tiruppēr, inhabited by truth-loving, knowledgeable persons who would parrot-like repeat what they had gathered from their preceptors, without any distortion or deviation.

\(ii\) From this land of dark nescience to the yonder land of perpetual clarity and brightness, it is indeed a far cry. And yet, the Lord, in His unbounded grace, has come forward to grant the Āḻvār, Heaven. The Āḻvār is aghast with wonder at that what would otherwise be extremely difficult of attainment is now brought by the Lord within his easy reach, indeed the Lord’s grace galore. The Āḻvār’s eyes beam with joy and so does his mind.




## 10.8.5
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வானே தருவான் எனக்காய் என்னோடுஒட்டி  
ஊன்ஏய் குரம்பை இதனுள் புகுந்து இன்று-  
தானே தடுமாற்ற வினைகள் தவிர்த்தான்  
தேனேய் பொழில் தென்திருப்பேர் நகரானே.

vāṉē taruvāṉ eṉakkāy eṉṉōṭuoṭṭi  
ūṉēy kurampai itaṉuḷ pukuntu iṉṟu-  
tāṉē taṭumāṟṟa viṉaikaḷ tavirttāṉ  
tēṉēy poḻil teṉtiruppēr nakarāṉē.

**English translation of verse 10.8.5:**

The Lord dwelling in Tiṛuppēr city, with orchards fine,  
Where honey bees hum gaily, is intent on putting me in Heaven;  
Pledged, as it were, He has unto me come, on His own  
And, entering this fleshy body of mine,  
Rid me of all impediments, the fruits of my past actions.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The Āḻvār exclaims that the Lord, enshrined in Tiruppēr, not only took a vow that He would take him to Heaven but also rid him of all impediments, the ‘Puṇya’ and ‘Pāpa’, merit and demerit respectively, the fruits of his actions, good and bad. As a matter of fact, the Lord has, all along, been very keen on taking the Āḻvār to Heaven but nevertheless kept him on, in this abode, only to get all these hymns, sung by him for the edification and enjoyment of the devotees over here. Now that this purpose of the Lord has been achieved, the Āḻvār is on the very verge of his ascent.

\(ii\) The Lord’s ardent fervour in taking the Āḻvār to Heaven is admirably elucidated here. He has taken a vow to grant the Āḻvār, the high Heaven, failing which He would forfeit His commanding position as the Lord of Heaven. This is indeed comparable with the solemn pledges the Lord had made during His incarnation as Rāma, once in regard to His crossing over to Laṅkā, through the sea, along with His army, and again, during His encounter with Rāvaṇa. The first oath was: “Adhya me maraṇam vāpi tharaṇam Sāgarasya vā” (either I get across the ocean or give up my life); the second one was: ‘Arāvaṇamarāmaṃ vā’ (either Rāvaṇa or Rāma shall cease to be).

\(iii\) No doubt, the Lord was intent upon taking the Āḻvār bodily to Heaven but He had to yield to the Āḻvār’s persistent demand to give up the idea. The next best He could do was to delve, with great delight, into the foul, fleshy body of the Āḻvār and cut out, *suo moto* (of His own accord) the ills and evils, separating the Aḻvār from Him. ‘puṇya’ (merit, accrued by dint of one’s good deeds) is but a gold fetter while ‘Pāpa’ (sin or demerit devolving from bad deeds) is an iron fetter. A gold fetter is a fetter, all the same, and thus it is as much an impediment as the iron fetter, which sin is.




## 10.8.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

திருப்பேர் நகரான் திருமாலிருஞ்சோலைப்  
பொருப்பே உறைகின்றபிரான் இன்றுவந்து  
இருப்பேன் என்று என்நெஞ்சு நிறையப் புகுந்தான்  
விருப்பே பெற்று அமுதம்உண்டு களித்தேனே.

tiruppēr nakarāṉ tirumāliruñcōlaip  
poruppē uṟaikiṉṟapirāṉ iṉṟuvantu  
iruppēṉ eṉṟu eṉneñcu niṟaiyap pukuntāṉ  
viruppē peṟṟu amutamuṇṭu kaḷittēṉē.

**English translation of verse 10.8.6:**

The Lord in Tiruppēr city, Who does also dwell  
In tirumāliruñcōlai and has many such abodes delectable, Has this day got inside me and my heart He does fill,  
Saying that there He will for ever stay; I do revel  
In His love, drinking deep of that nectar insatiable.

**Notes:**

\(i\) Many indeed arc the enchanting abodes of the Lord in His worshippable Form and yet, He has entered the Āḻvār’s heart as if He has nowhere else to go and now only He feels complacent as a ‘Kṛta Kṛtya’ (one who has discharged one’s duty thoroughly), after getting Himself lodged in the Āḻvār’s heart-region.

\(ii\) “*Has this day got inside me*”: Why this day only and not yesterday or the day before? It only shows the dawn of the Lord’s redemptive grace in having designed to come to the Āḻvār and get inside his heart, declaring that He will stay on, for ever, even as the exiled Rāma told Lakṣmaṇa in Pañcavaṭi that they would do well to set up their camp there under cover of the patronising wings of their most beloved Jaṭāyu, the vulture-king.—“Iha vatsyāmi Soumitre! sārdha methena pakṣiṇā.”

\(iii\) “*My heart, He does fill*”: No doubt, the Lord stays inside the heart of every one, as the Internal Controller of one and all, including the demoniac Kaṃsa and Śiśupāla, but His stay inside the Āḻvār’s heart makes aḷḷ the difference. The Lord’s stay inside the Āḻvār is not as a matter of routine duty, as in the case of the generality of His subjects but one bursting with joy and it is this exuberance of God’s love for him that the Āḻvār refers to here and revels in.




## 10.8.7
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

உண்டு களித்தேற்கு உம்பர்என் குறை மேலைத்-  
தொண்டு உகளித்து அந்தி தொழும் சொல்லுப் பெற்றேன்  
வண்டு களிக்கும் பொழில்சூழ் திருப்பேரான்  
கண்டு களிப்ப கண்ணுள்நின்று அகலானே.

uṇṭu kaḷittēṟku umpareṉ kuṟai mēlait-  
toṇṭu ukaḷittu anti toḻum collup peṟṟēṉ  
vaṇṭu kaḷikkum poḻilcūḻ tiruppērāṉ  
kaṇṭu kaḷippa kaṇṇuḷniṉṟu akalāṉē.

**English translation of verse 10.8.7:**

My Sire, Who dwells in Tiruppēr with its orchards fine,  
Where bees, fed on honey, go gay, stays in my view all the time,  
For my eyes to feast upon; unto me thus happily fed  
What is there in heaven to enjoy? I have tasted  
The bliss of service supreme and to its acme am I led  
Uttering the word ‘namaḥ’ to show that unto Him I belong.

**Notes:**

\(i\) Having tasted the supreme bliss of service unto the Lord, right here, by singing these love-laden songs, (Tiruvāymoḻi), the Āḻvār is led to pause and think what more could there be for him to enjoy on the yonder side of Heaven. Uttering the word ‘namaḥ’ or worship of the Lord, betokening one’s realisation of the true nature of the soul that one is the exclusive vassal of the Lord, totally dependent on and belonging to Him, is the logical culmination of the enjoyment of the bliss of Divine Service (kaiṅkarya rasa) “Nama ityeva vādhinaḥ”, Such a realisation having also dawned on the Āḻvār, what more does he need?

\(ii\) The Lord is now feasted upon continually, by the Āḻvār’s eyes which languished before, for want of this glorious vision. What is even more astounding is His firm hold on the heart of the Āḻvār. It is but natural that the Āḻvār rejoices, recounting all this felicity heaped on him by the Lord, madly in love with him.




## 10.8.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கண்ணுள் நின்று அகலான் கருத்தின்கண் பெரியன்  
எண்ணில்நுண் பொருள் ஏழ்இசையின் சுவைதானே  
வண்ணநல் மணிமாடங்கள்சூழ் திருப்பேரான்  
திண்ணம் என்மனத்துப் புகுந்தான் செறிந்துஇன்றே.

kaṇṇuḷ niṉṟu akalāṉ karuttiṉkaṇ periyaṉ

vaṇṇanal maṇimāṭaṅkaḷcūḻ tiruppērāṉ  
tiṇṇam eṉmaṉattup pukuntāṉ ceṟintuiṉṟē.

**English translation of verse 10.8.8:**

Subtle beyond the comprehension of those who seek to comprehend  
Is the Lord Supreme: the melodic essence of all music.  
The Lord now in Tiruppēr, by glittering castles bound,  
Is extra-keen on taking me to Heaven; He shan’t brook  
Being from my eyes apart and now it is certain indeed  
That He has firmly entered my mind.

**Notes:**

The Lord, too subtle to be comprehended by those who seek to comprehend Him through strenuous efforts, is now fiercely concentrating on the elaborate arrangements to be made in connection with the ensuing journey of the Āḻvār to Heaven. The Lord’s vision stands continually in front of the Āḻvār, feasting his eyes, and he is enjoying right here the blessed rapport of ‘Sadā paśyanti Sūrayaḥ’, the incessant comnunion with the Lord, on the yonder side of Heaven, the marvellous experience gone through by the denizens over there, ever fresh and exhilarating.

The Lord is subtle beyond comprehension and, in any case, none, not even the Āḻvār, can gauge and comprehend the depth of the Lord’s love unto him. The Lord’s aesthetic sense, His love for the art of music, can, at best, be summed up by saying that He is the melodic quintessence of the metrical sounds in their octaves. But then, the extent of His aesthetic delight, egging Him on to His profuse love for the Āḻvār and the manner in which He wants to exhibit it baffle all understanding.




## 10.8.9
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

இன்று என்னைப் பொருளாக்கி தன்னை என்னுள் வைத்தான்  
அன்று என்னைப் புறம்போகப் புணர்த்தது என் செய்வான்?  
குன்றுஎன்னத் திகழ்மாடங்கள்சூழ் திருப்பேரான்

kuṉṟueṉṉat tikaḻmāṭaṅkaḷcūḻ tiruppērāṉ  
oṉṟu eṉakkuaruḷceyya uṇarttaluṟṟēṉē.

**English translation of verse 10.8.9:**

On me, despised and neglected for ages, the Lord has now turned  
His attention and lodged Himself firm in my mind;  
May I ask the Lord at Tiruppēr, by solid mansions bound,  
Why indeed He had shut His eyes on me all these days  
But now sheds on me in super-abundance His grace,  
Would He deign to explain to me the one or the other?

**Notes:**

\(i\) This is the topical song of this decad. The gist of this song has already been set out in the form of a dialogue, opened by the Āḻvār with the Lord, in the preamble to this decad. When asked by his disciple, Nañcīyar, as to what reply the Lord gave to the Āḻvār, Śrī Parāśara Bhaṭṭar would appear to have said;

“The Lord has obviously no answer, as such. He, who had kept aloof from the Āḻvār all these days, putting one blame or the other at his door, now feels ashamed that he had not relcaimed him earlier, and, with His eyes fastened to the ground, He keeps scratching it with his toe.”—a graphic description indeed, which conveys vividly that the Lord’s dispensation, either way, springs from His Swātantarya (Independence, Free will), and not willing to say so to the Āḻvār, He discreetly kept silent. The position, in this regard, has been thrashed out in aphorisms 102 to 113 and 228 of ‘Ācārya Hṛdayam’. This is summarised below.

Surely, it is the Lord’s spontaneous grace that is now being shed on the Āḻvār, in super-abundance. According to his own admission, as we can cull out from his songs, the Āḻvār has not acquired any merit on his own through the pursuit of any one of the ‘Sādhana traya’, namely, Karma, Jñāna, Bhakti yogās, either in this birth or in the previous births. Right in this birth and that too, in a short time, God-love (Bhakti) of amazing dimensions, which would normally take ages of hard discipline to develop, has been generated in him by the Lord’s sweet grace. As a matter of fact, all the effort, needed for engendering ‘Bhakti’ of this magnitude in the Āḻvār, has been solely on the part of the Lord, the Indefatigable Cultivator, Who sows the seed of God-love in the subject’s mind and tills it to the point of fruition. It need not, for a moment, be doubted how the Lord’s grace could be unilateral without the effective involvement of the subjects, by way of self-effort, directed towards earning the requisite merit, the eligibility for the descent on him of the Lord’s grace. Well, even the twigs and tiny creatures of Ayodhyā went to Heaven, purely through Lord Rāma’s grace while the enchanting music of Lord Kṛṣṇa’s magic flute got even the trees and dumb creatures intoxicated with God-love. But then, it might be asked why the Lord should not extend such grace to one and all, instead of singling out the Āḻvār for the bestowal of His grace. This is tantamount to questioning the Lord’s will and wisdom, overlooking the fundamental fact that He is the Sovereign Master, absolutely independent and, therefore, free to bestow His gifts on whomsoever He pitches upon, at His sweet will and pleasure. Tradition has it that, in the good olden days, when the king of the land passed away and there was none in the regular line of succession to succeed him, the choice of the new king was made in a peculiar way. Peculiar though, it was accepted by the subjects without question. The crown eḻephant of the state would move about, holding a garland in its trunk. The person, on whom the elephant placed the garland, was crowned forthwith. Is the Sovereign Lord open to question if this elephant was not? Again, if the king lavished his affections on a particular lady, out of so many kept in his harem, none would dare to scrutinise and question why the king did so, when there were many others in his harem, equally charming, if not more.

\(ii\) Granting that the Āḻvār was not conscious of any merit in him, as such, could it be that the Lord redeemed him because of some hidden merit in him (ajñāta sukṛta) leading to vicarious reward? Well, the Āḻvār, endowed with knowledge, full and complete, clear and concise, who has thrown light on himself as well as many others through his mystic comprehension right from where he was, would certainly be conscious of the hidden merit in him, if there was any such thing at all. No doubt, the Āḻvār had a God-bent mind, soaked in God-love, but these traits of ‘Adveṣa’ (nonhatred and non-disinclination) and ‘ābhimukya’ (loving attention) towards God were not the outcome of his own merit but the work of God Himself. Did not the Āḻvār admit in II-7-8, that the Lord reconditioned his foul mind and redeemed it? Again, did he not acknowledge, in the immediately preceding song (2-7-7), that it was Vāmana, his Lord, Who ushered in him a mind, laid at His lotus feet, adoring Him all the time? It may be recalled, in this context, that Nampiḷḷai would say that it was not a case of reconditioning the Āḻvār’s mind, so as to make it God-bent, but one of providing a new mind altogether from the Lord’s strong-room, where valuables are stored up.

\(iii\) If the Āḻvār, who had strayed away, far too long, veered round and said that, by his own inclination, he lodged the Lord in his mind and that both he and his mind submitted to the Lord’s loving care, it should be realised that it was through the Lord’s strenuous and unremitting endeavours that the Āḻvār could be brought round, in this manner. The mere inclination to submit oneself to the Lord’s loving protection cannot, by any means, be regarded as the means employed for attaining Him, for, on the face of it, it is ludicrous to equate things which bear no comparison to each other. The casual utterance of the words ‘Mādhava’ and ‘Tirumāliruñcōlai’ without so much as the thought crossing one’s mind that the former is the Lord’s name and the latter, the name of a pilgrim centre very dear to Him, could no doubt come in for reward at the hands of the merciful Lord, according to His extra-liberal standards of securing the vicarious redemption of His subjects. Even so, much-too-slender that these methods are, they can hardly be regarded as the means for the attainment of the Supreme Lord. As a matter of fact, there was a time when the Lord claimed the Āḻvār as His own, and the latter repelled the former, saying that he Was his own and called upon the Lord to prove His claim by adducing the relevant evidence in support thereof. The Lord was knocked down, at every turn, by the recalcitrant subject, evidence such as the ‘Vedas’ and the utterances of the sages being dubbed partisan, one-sided and so on. When all arguments failed, the Lord had to wean round the Subject, crossing swords with Him, by exhibiting His enthralling Form. It was this exquisite charm of the Lord that induced God-love in the straying subject and made him realise and repent that he had expropriated the Lord’s property, all along, that is, looked upon his soul as belonging to him whereas it actually belonged to the Lord and thus committed a grave theft (ātmāpahāra). When all is said and done, the Lord Himself constitutes the merit (Sukṛt) for the Āḻvār’s deliverance and if the Lord’s redemptive grace did not alight on the Āḻvār, so far and it materialised only now, no other explanation can be adduced except attributing this to the Lord’s sweet, spontaneous grace, alighting, at His will, on the subjects of His choice, as the Āḻvār himself has brought out now and again. Well, it is the influx of the Lord’s grace that really matters and not the why and wherefore of it. Does any one who quenches the parching thirst, by drinking the milk of the cocanut, ever pause to examine beforehand how at all the milk got inside the cocanut?




## 10.8.10
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

உற்றேன் உகந்து பணிசெய்து உன்பாதம்-  
பெற்றேன் ஈதே இன்னம் வேண்டுவது எந்தாய்  
கற்றார் மறைவாணர்கள்சூழ் திருப்பேராற்கு  
அற்றார் அடியார் தமக்கு அல்லல் நில்லாவே. (2)

**English translation of verse 10.8.10:**

My Sire, Your lovely feet have I attained and rendered  
Loving service unto You, singing these songs; what’s now desired  
Is but the extension of this bliss; the learned ones, well-versed  
In the Vedic lore, solely devoted to you, my Lord,  
In Tiruppēr enshrined, will from grief for ever be freed.

**Notes:**

\(i\) After keeping quiet for a while, without furnishing any reply to the Āḻvār’s query as in the last song, the Lord enquired of the Āḻvār what more he needed. The Āḻvār’s reply is, as above. Having been assigned the blissful service of singing this great hymnal (Tiruvāymoḻi) there is indeed no greater felicity he could aspire. Immensely pleased with this reply, the Lord nodded His head with joy. Thereupon, the Āḻvār extolled the learned residents of Tiruppēr, rendering devoted service at the feet of the Lord enshrined there, as men well beyond the grip of grief.

\(ii\) It seems necessary, in this context, to clear the possible misconception that, by redeeming the Āḻvār, on His own, without any merit in him, the Lord laid Himself open to the charge of partiality, leading to invidious distinction, shaking the very foundation of the Śāstras and thus paving the way for emancipation of the worldlings, *en masse*, (Sarva mukti). That the Lord is above blame will be seen straightway, if due note is taken of the fact that the Lord can do precious little to those who strike a divergent path and move away from Him, all the time. It is only when the human heart sparkles with God-love, that the Lord’s advance towards man will make sense. Even so, the mere fact that one is God-bent, by virtue of the inherent nature of the Soul, endowed with intelligence, cannot impart to this attitude the stature of the ‘means’ for attaining Him, and in fact, there is no ‘means’ worth the name, comparable with the ‘end’ attained. It is a thousand pities that clarity is a far cry with quite a few people who stick to their guns with miserable obstinacy, always wanting to adduce some reason or the other, however negligible, smacking of personal effort for compelling the Lord’s grace, depriving it of the element of sweet spontaniety.




## 10.8.11
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நில்லா அல்லல் நீள்வயல்சூழ் திருப்பேர்மேல்  
நல்லார் பலர்வாழ் குருகூர்ச் சடகோபன்  
சொல்லார் தமிழ் ஆயிரத்துள் இவைபத்தும்-  
வல்லார் தொண்டர்ஆள்வது சூழ்பொன் விசும்பே. (2)

nillā allal nīḷvayalcūḻ tiruppērmēl  
nallār palarvāḻ kurukūrc caṭakōpaṉ  
collār tamiḻ āyirattuḷ ivaipattum-  
vallār toṇṭarāḷvatu cūḻpoṉ vicumpē. (2)

**English translation of verse 10.8.11:**

The devotees, well-versed in these songs ten,  
Out of the thousand composed in chaste Tamil by Caṭakōpaṉ  
Of Kurukūr, the home of many good men, in adoration  
Of the Lord at Tiruppēr, which rich fields adjoin,  
The holy centre with hardly any room for affliction,  
Will surely hold sway over the glittering Heaven.

**Notes:**

The chanters of this decad are assured not merely of their ascent to heaven but they will go there as masters and not as mere residents.
