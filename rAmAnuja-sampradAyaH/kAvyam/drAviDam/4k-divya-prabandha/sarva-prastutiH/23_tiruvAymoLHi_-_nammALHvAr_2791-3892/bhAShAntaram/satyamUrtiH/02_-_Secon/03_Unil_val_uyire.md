## 00 Intro2.3
In the first decad of this centum, we saw the Āḻvār in dire distress. Towards the end, the Lord, however, deigned to present Himself and once again, the Āḻvār is in rapturous rapport with the Lord. In this decad, he gives vent to the joy of reunion with the enchanting Lord. In strict sequence, this should have been the second decad instead of being the third. The Āḻvār’s immediate reaction, on seeing the Lord come back to him, was, however, that one of such super eminence, the overlord of the Celestials, should have at all deigned to mingle with one so low. And, therefore, he straightaway expatiated on the Lord’s transcendental glory, in the second decad.




## 2.3.1
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஊனில் வாழ் உயிரே நல்லை போ உன்னைப் பெற்று,  
வான் உளார் பெருமான் மதுசூதன் என் அம்மான்,  
தானும் யானும் எல்லாம் தன்னுள்ளே கலந்தொழிந்தோம்,  
தேனும் பாலும் நெய்யும் கன்னலும் அமுதும் ஒத்தே.

ūṉil vāḻ uyirē nallai pō uṉṉaip peṟṟu,  
vāṉ uḷār perumāṉ matucūtaṉ eṉ ammāṉ,  
tāṉum yāṉum ellām taṉṉuḷḷē kalantoḻintōm,  
tēṉum pālum neyyum kaṉṉalum amutum ottē.

**English translation of verse 2.3.1:**

Oh, ye mind, dwelling in the fleshy body,  
You are indeed good; because of you, It (this vassal)  
Could with Matucūtaṉ, my Lord, mingle, chief of Celestials  
And into Him dissolve like honey, milk, nectar and candy.

**Notes**

\(i\) In this decad, where the Āḻvār gives vent to his joy of communion with the Lord, the one he was pining for, praise is first bestowed on his forward mind which had overtaken him in its flight to God, seeking the bliss of union with Him. This is like a prince, restored back to his lost kingdom by some one, thanking that person first. The word ‘Uyir’ (soul) in the original text, by implication, refers to the mind, the principal adjunct, stirring up one’s thoughts either way.

\(ii\) The last line refers to the blend of all that is delicious and it can either be an admixture of all these delicacies or the mixture of like things only, (i.e.) honey with honey, milk with milk, nectar with nectar and so on.




## 2.3.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஒத்தார் மிக்காரை இலையாய மாமாய,  
ஒத்தாய் எப் பொருட்கும் உயிர் ஆய், என்னைப் பெற்ற-  
அத் தாய் ஆய் தந்தை ஆய் அறியாதன அறிவித்து,  
அத்தா, நீ செய்தன அடியேன் அறியேனே.

ottār mikkārai ilaiyāya māmāya,  
ottāy ep poruṭkum uyir āy, eṉṉaip peṟṟa-  
at tāy āy tantai āy aṟiyātaṉa aṟivittu,  
attā, nī ceytaṉa aṭiyēṉ aṟiyēṉē.

**English translation of verse 2.3.2:**

There’s none above you, Oh, Lord of wondrous traits!  
And none equal to you, and yet forms you’d take  
Like all others; you are the life-giver  
To one and all, the Mother that yielded me, the Father  
And Preceptor, ‘tis beyond me to list out all your favours.

**Notes**

\(i\) While patting on the back of his forward mind, in the preceding song, the Āḻvār realised that even such an evolved mind was but the Lord’s gift and, therefore, he passed on to sing the glory of God.

\(ii\) When this song was discoursed upon, by that great preceptor, Empār, the question was raised by some one in the learned assembly as to who is the first spiritual preceptor for every Individual. Some said, “The Guru who imparts the requisite spiritual knowledge”, while some others observed “It is the Śrī Vaiṣṇava who puts us on to the spiritual preceptor for acceptance”. Empār, however, clarified: “Indeed, the Lord, seated in the region of our heart, is the first Preceptor, hidden and unseen though, for it is He who, from His vantage position inside us, granted us the impulse not to resist but to yield to the good offices of the visible preceptors outside and of the helpers who put us on to such preceptors.




## 2.3.3
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அறியாக் காலத்துள்ளே அடிமைக்கண் அன்பு செய்வித்து,  
அறியா மா மாயத்து அடியேனை வைத்தாயால்,  
அறியாமைக் குறள் ஆய் நிலம் மாவலி மூவடி என்று,  
அறியாமை வஞ்சித்தாய் எனது ஆவியுள் கலந்தே.

aṟiyāk kālattuḷḷē aṭimaikkaṇ aṉpu ceyvittu,  
aṟiyā mā māyattu aṭiyēṉai vaittāyāl,  
aṟiyāmaik kuṟaḷ āy nilam māvali mūvaṭi eṉṟu,  
aṟiyāmai vañcittāy eṉatu āviyuḷ kalantē.

**English translation of verse 2.3.3:**

Wonderful ‘tis, you got into my mind,  
And in me, in (the clutches of) this mystic land,  
Still immature, did instil the desire to serve you around,  
Even as you did on the sly, obtain the land  
Of three strides from Māvali (Mahābali), as Vāmaṉa, the little lad.

**Note**

The present versification conforms to the interpretation given by Śrī Rāmānuja, duly changing the prose order of the text, as in the original, quite in keeping with the current milieu. Śrī Rāmānuja was taught the meaning of this song by his spiritual Instructor (Tirumālai Āṇṭāṉ), as follows, without any change in the prose order of the poem (as in the original text).

> “You instilled in me the desire to serve you at a time when I was
> hardly evolved and yet, you have kept me wallowing in worldly life,
> the hot-bed for ignorance, instead of promoting my God-love and
> providing the necessary incentives therefor”.

Śrī Rāmānuja had, however, no hesitation in pointing out to the learned Instructor that, put that way, it would be a reproach against the Lord and would, therefore, be a misfit in this decad, where the Āḻvār gives vent to the joy of Union with the Lord and sings His glory.




## 2.3.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

எனது ஆவியுள் கலந்த பெரு நல் உதவிக் கைம்மாறு,  
எனது ஆவி தந்தொழிந்தேன், இனி மீள்வது என்பது உண்டே,  
எனது ஆவி ஆவியும் நீ பொழில் ஏழும் உண்ட எந்தாய்,  
எனது ஆவி யார்? யான் ஆர்? தந்த நீ கொண்டாக்கினையே.

eṉatu āviyuḷ kalanta peru nal utavik kaimmāṟu,  
eṉatu āvi tantoḻintēṉ, iṉi mīḷvatu eṉpatu uṇṭē,  
eṉatu āvi āviyum nī poḻil ēḻum uṇṭa entāy,  
eṉatu āvi yār? yāṉ ār? tanta nī koṇṭākkiṉaiyē.

**English translation of verse 2.3.4:**

My Sire, Who did in your stomach sustain  
The worlds seven, you dissolved into my soul;  
For this great good, my soul I offer you, in return,  
There isn’t any going back; but what is my soul?  
Who am I? what is yours indeed, you have taken,  
You are the Giver great, the Soul of my soul.

**Notes**

For all the good done to him by the Lord, the Āḻvār wanted to recompense Him and so, he offered his soul to the Lord, adding, with extra gusto, that it was a firm offer from which he would not recant. A little introspection, however, made him realise that there is hardly anything which does not belong to God and there is, therefore, no question of surrendering the soul to the Lord to whom it rightly belongs. What is it that is being surrendered and whose was it before the surrender? To surrender to the Lord that which already belongs to Him would be tantamount to the assumption of an ill-conceived right of ownership of the thing surrendered, in derogation of the divine right of ownership.

These very sentiments were echoed by Saint Yāmuna in ślokas 52 and 53 of ‘Stotra Ratna’ (hymnal gems). Well, the dilemma in which Saint Nammāḻvār and Saint Yāmunācārya were caught up, is bound to present itself to every one of us, as long as we live in this abode. Scared by the horrors of earthly existence, one is tempted to surrender one’s soul to the Lord, as if it is one’s own and could be bartered away in this manner, and. then the correction follows, based on the realisation of one’s essential nature and the inter-relationship between Man and God. Surrendering oneself unto the keeping of the Lord, with the full awareness and awakening of one’s essential nature (svarūpa), as the Lord’s own, solely dependent on Him, stands, however, on a different footing.




## 2.3.5
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

இனி யார் ஞானங்களால் எடுக்கல் எழாத எந்தாய்,  
கனிவார் வீட்டு இன்பமே என் கடல் படா அமுதே,  
தனியேன் வாழ் முதலே பொழில் ஏழும் ஏனம் ஒன்றாய்,  
நுனி ஆர் கோட்டில் வைத்தாய் நுன பாதம் சேர்ந்தேனே.

iṉi yār ñāṉaṅkaḷāl eṭukkal eḻāta entāy,  
kaṉivār vīṭṭu iṉpamē eṉ kaṭal paṭā amutē,  
taṉiyēṉ vāḻ mutalē poḻil ēḻum ēṉam oṉṟāy,  
nuṉi ār kōṭṭil vaittāy nuṉa pātam cērntēṉē.

**English translation of verse 2.3.5:**

My Lord, mere learning, however profound, Can’t comprehend Thee,  
Unto your lovers you are the fountain of heavenly bliss;  
You are my nectar, not that stuff from the Saltish sea,  
But the very source of life for this lover peerless;  
On your pointed tusk, you lifted the worlds seven,  
As the Boar unique and so have I your feet now attained.

**Note**

The Āḻvār rejoices that he has been reclaimed by the Lord from the Ocean of Saṃsāra, even as He reclaimed the Earth from under the Oceanic waters, after slaying Hiraṇyākṣa, the golden-eyed demon.




## 2.3.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

சேர்ந்தார் தீவினைகட்கு அரு நஞ்சை திண் மதியை,  
தீர்ந்தார் தம் மனத்துப் பிரியாது அவர் உயிரைச்,  
சோர்ந்தே புகல் கொடாச் சுடரை அரக்கியை மூக்கு-  
ஈர்ந்தாயை, அடியேன் அடைந்தேன் முதல் முன்னமே.

cērntār tīviṉaikaṭku aru nañcai tiṇ matiyai,  
tīrntār tam maṉattup piriyātu avar uyiraic,  
cōrntē pukal koṭāc cuṭarai arakkiyai mūkku-  
īrntāyai, aṭiyēṉ aṭaintēṉ mutal muṉṉamē.

**English translation of verse 2.3.6:**

Unto your devotees, you vouchsafe a mind steady and bright.  
Never apart from the devout, you are their very life and beacon light.  
A deadly poison for their sins, the devil’s (Sūrpaṇakhā’s) nose you smote,  
From the earliest time this vassal is at your feet.

**Notes**

\(i\) The Āḻvār affirms that he always belonged to the Lord and rejoices, now that he is in the Lord’s company, forgetting all the pangs of the earlier separation.

\(ii\) It is said that one has to inevitably pass through the reactions of one’s past actions. But this is true only in the case of those who are not devoted to the Supreme Lord, while, in respect of the devout, He operates as a deadly poison, destroying all their sins.

\(iii\) Steadfastness of mind is indeed one of His great gifts. Here is a nice illustration.

When king Ambaṛṣa was doing *Tapas*, in devout contemplation of Lord Mahā Viṣṇu, the Lord appeared before him, disguised as Indra and insisted that the King should ask of him boons. As Indra was not the Deity the King was meditating upon, the latter resented the former’s intrusion and requested him to get away, his exalted position notwithstanding

\(iv\) When a lustrous gem is reclaimed from the slush into which it had got sunk for long, it shines again as before, as this sheen is nothing new and the lustre always belonged to it. Similar is the case with the Āḻvār who always belonged to the Lord, but stands reclaimed only now.




## 2.3.7
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

முன் நல் யாழ் பயில் நூல் நரம்பின் முதிர் சுவையே,  
பல் நலார் பயிலும் பரனே பவித்திரனே,  
கன்னலே அமுதே கார் முகிலே என் கண்ணா,  
நின் அலால் இலேன்காண் என்னை நீ குறிக்கொள்ளே.

muṉ nal yāḻ payil nūl narampiṉ mutir cuvaiyē,  
pal nalār payilum paraṉē pavittiraṉē,  
kaṉṉalē amutē kār mukilē eṉ kaṇṇā,  
niṉ alāl ilēṉkāṇ eṉṉai nī kuṟikkoḷḷē.

**English translation of verse 2.3.7:**

You are the delectable melody, chaste and matured, From the ancient lyre, and by the eminent adored;  
Oh, Lord! pure and Supreme, sweet like nectar and cane juice  
My cloud-hued Kaṇṇā! I do seek refuge  
In none but you, take note and make me yours.

**Notes**

\(i\) Notwithstanding the assertion, as in the last song, that he belonged to the Lord from time immemorial, the Āḻvār apprehends the frightful possibility of getting separated from the Lord, over again, and he, therefore, entreats Him to note that he cannot brook separation from Him Who is sweetness itself. The sweetness of music which attracts the cow, the infant and the snake alike, is proverbial, and the Lord is the very source of this sweetness.

\(ii\) That the Lord is pure needs no special mention but what is emphasised here is that He purifies worldlings like us and makes us fit to join the rank and file of the pure souls in the yonder Heavens.




## 2.3.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

குறிக்கொள் ஞானங்களால் எனை ஊழி செய் தவமும்,  
கிறிக்கொண்டு இப் பிறப்பே சில நாளில் எய்தினன் யான்,  
உறிக்கொண்ட வெண்ணெய் பால் ஒளித்து உண்ணும் அம்மான் பின்,  
நெறிக்கொண்ட நெஞ்சனாய்ப் பிறவித் துயர் கடிந்தே.

kuṟikkoḷ ñāṉaṅkaḷāl eṉai ūḻi cey tavamum,  
kiṟikkoṇṭu ip piṟappē cila nāḷil eytiṉaṉ yāṉ,  
uṟikkoṇṭa veṇṇey pāl oḷittu uṇṇum ammāṉ piṉ,  
neṟikkoṇṭa neñcaṉāyp piṟavit tuyar kaṭintē.

**English translation of verse 2.3.8:**

Right in this birth and in a short space  
Have I attained what others achieve down the ages  
Through deep penance and Knowledge intense,  
Freed from the miseries of birth, all by the grace  
Of my Lord, who stole and ate from hanging hoops  
Milk and butter, with my mind unto Him very close.

**Note**

The Āḻvār could attain the Lord right now, not by following the disciplines, rigid and rigorous, but solely by His Grace which alighted on him while contemplating the boyish pranks of the Lord, as Śrī Kṛṣṇa, eating stealthily, the milk and butter, stored up in hanging hoops, in the pastoral village of Gokula.




## 2.3.9
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கடி வார் தண் அம் துழாய்க் கண்ணன் விண்ணவர் பெருமான்,  
படி வானம் இறந்த பரமன் பவித்திரன் சீர்,  
செடி ஆர் நோய்கள் கெட படிந்து குடைந்து ஆடி,  
அடியேன் வாய்மடுத்துப் பருகிக் களித்தேனே.

kaṭi vār taṇ am tuḻāyk kaṇṇaṉ viṇṇavar perumāṉ,  
paṭi vāṉam iṟanta paramaṉ pavittiraṉ cīr,  
ceṭi ār nōykaḷ keṭa paṭintu kuṭaintu āṭi,  
aṭiyēṉ vāymaṭuttup parukik kaḷittēṉē.

**English translation of verse 2.3.9:**

Sporting the Cool tulacī garland, full of fragrance,  
Kaṇṇaṉ, Chief of Celestials, has no equal,  
Even in heaven; unto Him, pure and supreme, this vassal  
Could come close and get rid of sins, vast and dense,  
Revelling and singing profusely His traits auspicious.

**Note**

The Āḻvār rejoices that he could partake of the heavenly bliss even here, as the Lord is right with him in all His celestial grandeur, the dense sins which stood between him and the Lord having been eradicated, root and branch, by His grace. It is a case of the immaculate Lord purifying one and all falling within the purview of His sweet, spontaneous grace.




## 2.3.10
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

களிப்பும் கவர்வும் அற்று பிறப்புப் பிணி மூப்பு இறப்பு அற்று,  
ஒளிக்கொண்ட சோதியுமாய் உடன்கூடுவது என்று கொலோ,  
துளிக்கின்ற வான் இந்நிலம் சுடர் ஆழி சங்கு ஏந்தி,  
அளிக்கின்ற மாயப் பிரான் அடியார்கள் குழாங்களையே.

kaḷippum kavarvum aṟṟu piṟappup piṇi mūppu iṟappu aṟṟu,  
oḷikkoṇṭa cōtiyumāy uṭaṉkūṭuvatu eṉṟu kolō,  
tuḷikkiṉṟa vāṉ innilam cuṭar āḻi caṅku ēnti,  
aḷikkiṉṟa māyap pirāṉ aṭiyārkaḷ kuḻāṅkaḷaiyē.

**English translation of verse 2.3.10:**

Oh, when shall I enter and enjoy the holy gatherings  
Of devotees of the wondrous Lord, holding the conch and discus radiant,  
Protector of Heaven and Earth, the light that all knowledge illumines,  
Getting rid of pleasures worldly and the resultant sufferings,  
Birth and death, old age and pestilence?

**Note**

In the preceding song, the Āḻvār gave vent to his supreme joy, exclaiming that the very heavenly bliss had come to him, right here.

The Lord asked the Āḻvār whether there was anything more He could do for him.

The Āḻvār replied:

> “My Lord, there is no doubt that 1 have found Heaven on Earth. But
> then, the fear whether the present enjoyment can go on for all time
> without interruption, haunts me situated as I am, in this material
> body, with all the ailments flesh is heir to, surrounded by the
> material world, swayed by the wayward senses. And, therefore, this
> body should go and the scene shifted to the uncontaminated High
> Heavens where I could enjoy the holy company of the ‘Nityas’
> (ever-free angels) and the ‘Muktas’ (the released souls)”.




## 2.3.11
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

குழாம் கொள் பேர் அரக்கன் குலம் வீய முனிந்தவனை,  
குழாம் கொள் தென் குருகூர்ச் சடகோபன் தெரிந்து உரைத்த,  
குழாம் கொள் ஆயிரத்துள் இவை பத்தும் உடன் பாடி,  
குழாங்களாய் அடியீர் உடன் கூடிநின்று ஆடுமினே.

kuḻām koḷ pēr arakkaṉ kulam vīya muṉintavaṉai,  
kuḻām koḷ teṉ kurukūrc caṭakōpaṉ terintu uraitta,  
kuḻām koḷ āyirattuḷ ivai pattum uṭaṉ pāṭi,  
kuḻāṅkaḷāy aṭiyīr uṭaṉ kūṭiniṉṟu āṭumiṉē.

**English translation of verse 2.3.11:**

Dance, ye devotees! in a body, singing diligently, these songs ten,  
Out of the cluster of thousand learned songs of Caṭakōpaṉ,  
Chief of the apostles of Ten Kurukūr, in adoration  
Of the irate Lord, who routed the demon (Rāvaṇa) and his battalions.

**Note**

In this end-stanza, there is a departure from the usual pattern of setting out the benefits of learning and singing the ten songs in each decad. The Āḻvār emphasises the importance of these ten songs being sung in a chorus by the devotees, as an end in itself. It may also be construed that those who learn these ten songs will have the felicity of singing them in the holy company of devotees, unlike the Āḻvār, who languished for want of such an association.

It is worth repeating here the following exhortation of Nampiḷḷai, the great Preceptor:

> “Until you reach the Eternal Land, the few of you who are devoted to
> the Supreme Lord, should, during the few days of your stay in this
> abode, sink all petty differences, based on lust and lucre, and sing,
> in one voice, the Lord’s glory, for your common enjoyment and
> edification”.
