## 00 Intro9.3
In the last decad, the Āḻvār fervently prayed that the Lord be pleased to turn His sweet glances on him, grant audience to him and the denizens of all the three worlds, remaining in a seated posture, beckon him or come down to him and permit him to stroke His lovely pair of feet and so on. The Lord, however, focussed the Saint’s attention on the fundamental relationship that subsists between them, which hardly affords scope for such entreaties by him and, much less, for the grief that results from the Lord’s apparent non-compliance. The basic fact of the Lord being none other than Nārāyaṇa, in whom all things and beings inhere and who abides in all, reduces all things and beings to the abject position of mere bodies unto the Life within, that dominates, directs, and supports them. Consoled thus by the Lord, in quite a convincing manner, the Saint not only regains his composure but admires the Lord’s tender solicitude for His subjects. This decad gives expression to the Saint’s rapturous admiration of the Lord’s great concern for His creatures and loving condescension. Having set out in VIII-8, the substance of the eight-lettered, three-syllabled Tirumantra and dwelt on the deep urge for Divine Service which ‘Āya’, the dative case-ending of the word ‘Nārāyaṇāya’ in the said Mantra reveals, the Āḻvār spells out the Mantra itself, in the opening song of this decad, which declares: “Nārāyaṇaṉ is our sole Benefactor”.




## 9.3.1
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஓராயிரமாய் உலகுஏழ்அளிக்கும்  
பேராயிரம்கொண்டதுஓர் பீடுஉடையன்  
காராயின காளநல்மேனியினன்  
நாரயணன் நங்கள்பிரான்அவனே. (2)

ōrāyiramāy ulakuēḻaḷikkum  
pērāyiramkoṇṭatuōr pīṭuuṭaiyaṉ  
kārāyiṉa kāḷanalmēṉiyiṉaṉ  
nārayaṇaṉ naṅkaḷpirāṉavaṉē. (2)

**English translation of verse 9.3.1:**

Nārāyaṇaṉ is our sole Benefactor Who bears  
A thousand names and the seven worlds succours;  
Indeed, each name of the cloud-hued Lord of exquisite form  
Will the functions fulfil of a thousand names.

**Notes:**

\(i\) When it is said that the Supreme Lord bears a thousand names, “Devo nāmasahasravān”, it only means ‘many’ and not literally limited to a bare thousand. When it is said, pointing to a band of valiant warriors of established fame, that each one of them is equivalent to a thousand fighters, we don’t take this figure literally but understand that each one possesses the strength and skill of many. Even so, the Lord bears innumerable names, each of which has the potentiality of several other names and fulfils the multifarious functions of the Lord. Indeed, the holy names of the Lord are most endearing and soothing to a great degree. Koyilāyttāṉ a staunch disciple of Śrī Parāśara Bhaṭṭar had a son, named after the Ācārya, out of love for him. The son, however, passed away, plunging Koyilāyttāṉ in inconsolable grief. Bemoaning his great loss, he cast himself at the feet of the Ācārya who consoled him thus: “I know your grief is so great, because your son bore my name, which is very dear unto you. Now, I ask you not to grieve any more, for I bear that name and am alive to comfort you”, So saying, the compassionate Ācārya got an image made like himself and handed it to the bereaved disciple, to dwell upon lovingly, as a holy Souvenir.

\(ii\) The Lord’s exquisite Form helps one to see. in Him the aggregate of the excellences denoted by His numerous names and enjoy them, all at once. His Form thus impounds His names like the embankment which contains the flooding waters, preventing their erosive excursions in different directions.




## 9.3.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அவனேஅகல்ஞாலம் படைத்துஇடந்தான்  
அவனேஅஃதுஉண்டுஉமிழ்ந்தான் அளந்தான்  
அவனேஅவனும் அவனும்அவனும்  
அவனே மற்றுஎல்லாமும் அறிந்தனமே.

**English translation of verse 9.3.2:**

‘Tis He Who did ordain the spacious Universe  
And pulled it out from beneath the deep waters

‘Tis He Who the said Universe did gulp once,  
Then spat and spanned; he (Brahmā), he (Śiva) and he (Indra), He is,  
And all other things and beings, He is besides;  
[This] we learn (thro’ knowledge by Him bestowed).

**Notes:**

The Supreme Lord, as the great Ordainer of the Universe, combines in Himself all the three causes of creation, the material, the operative and the instrumental. He is also ṭhe Universal Saviour Who sustained the Universe inside His stomach, during the deluge, rescued it from the oceanic depths after encountering the formidable Hiraṇyākṣa, the golden-eyed demon and so on. The lands expropriated by the powerful Mahābali were reclaimed by the Lord by spanning all the worlds, in just three strides, and restored to the Devās. The Lord is the Internal Controller of one and all, without distinction of high and low; the original text of the song runs as “He is he, he and he....”, in the Vedic pattern of ‘*Sa* Brahmās *sa* Śivas *sa* Indras sokṣaraḥ Paramaśvarāṭ....” (Puruṣa Sūkta). The pronoun ‘He’, occurring seven times, in the original text of this song, is indicated by ‘Saḥ’ (He) occuring in the above vedic text. The exalted Brahmā, Śiva, Indra and other Celestials as well as the ordinary denizens elsewhere are all dominated by the Lord, as their Internal Controller, a fact revealed to the Āḻvār by the Lord Himself, vide I-1-1.




## 9.3.3
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அறிந்தனவேத அரும்பொருள்நூல்கள்  
அறிந்தனகொள்க அரும்பொருள்ஆதல்  
அறிந்தனர்எல்லாம் அரியைவணங்கி  
அறிந்தனர் நோய்கள்அறுக்கும்மருந்தே.

aṟintaṉakoḷka arumporuḷātal  
aṟintaṉarellām ariyaivaṇaṅki  
aṟintaṉar nōykaḷaṟukkummaruntē.

**English translation of verse 9.3.3:**

The texts, that reveal the Vedic truths abstruse, apprehend,  
The Lord as no more than One difficult to comprehend;  
The learned ones who propitiate Him do no better fare,  
They look upon Him as no more than the certain cure  
For their ills and evils; (they perceive Him not  
As the fountain source of bliss supreme and on Him dote not.)

**Notes:**

The Vedas proclaimed, “Vedāha metaṃ Puruṣaṃ Mahāntaṃ....”, that is, the Supreme Lord has been comprehended by them. But what indeed did they know except that the Lord is not easy of comprehension? The ‘Itihāsas’ (Rāmāyaṇa and Mahā-Bhārata) and the ‘Purāṇas’, which serve as the key to the study of the Vedas, fare no better. And what about the great sages like Vyāsa, Parāśara and Vālmīki? They could see in the Lord, no more than the cure for all their ills and evils—“Haraṇā Deva dukkānāṃ [Haṛṛtyabhidīyate][?]”, It is a pity, they could not delve deeper than this and revel in His exquisite Form and nectarean sweetness, as the Āḻvār Saints did.




## 9.3.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மருந்தேநங்கள் போக மகிழ்ச்சிக்குஎன்று  
பெரும்தேவர் குழாங்கள் பிதற்றும்பிரான்  
கரும்தேவன்எம்மான் கண்ணன்விண்உலகம்  
தரும்தேவனைச் சோரேல்கண்டாய்மனமே!

maruntēnaṅkaḷ pōka makiḻccikkueṉṟu  
perumtēvar kuḻāṅkaḷ pitaṟṟumpirāṉ  
karumtēvaṉemmāṉ kaṇṇaṉviṇulakam  
tarumtēvaṉaic cōrēlkaṇṭāymaṉamē!

**English translation of verse 9.3.4:**

Lose not, my mind, your hold on Kaṇṇaṉ, our dark-hued Sire,  
The Lord, Who the heavenly bliss does grant,  
Whose glory, as their elixir, the great stabiliser  
Of their bliss in heaven, the Celestials do for ever chant.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The Āḻvār exhorts his mind, as follows:

“The Lord of nectarean sweetness, unto the Celestials in Heaven, came down here as kṛṣṇa, to put us also in Heaven, in the midst of the ‘Nitya Sūrīs’ over there. Having got at such a great Benefactor, cling fast to Him and never loosen Your grip on Him”.

\(ii\) Even the Lord’s charming beauty is an impediment for service, as it steals away the hearts of the devotees, thereby tending to slacken the service. Even as the prayer for service, contained in ‘Dvaya’, the ‘Mantra Ratna’ (Gem of a Mantra), is eternal, prayer for the eradication of the obstacle to Divine service should also be eternal, for the reason that this obstacle confronts even the inhabitants of Heaven, namely, the ‘Released’ souls and the Ever-free (Nitya Sūrīs). This has been brought out, in this song, through a statement ascribed to the ‘Nitya Sūrīs’ that even they, in Heaven, get thrown off their feet by the ecstasy of the Lord’s personal charms and the marvellous communications from that inexhaustible fountain of bliss. They get cured of such temporary aberrations by the Lord Himself, Who serves as the stabilising antidote (Elixir) and puts them back on the right track, namely, self-less service unto the Lord, bereft of the last shred of selfish enjoyment and happiness of their own.




## 9.3.5
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மனமே! உன்னை வல்வினையேன்இரந்து  
கனமேசொல்லினேன் இதுசோரேல்கண்டாய்  
புனம்மேவிய பூந்தண்துழாய் அலங்கல்  
இனம்ஏதும்இலானை அடைவதுமே.

maṉamē! uṉṉai valviṉaiyēṉirantu  
kaṉamēcolliṉēṉ itucōrēlkaṇṭāy  
puṉammēviya pūntaṇtuḻāy alaṅkal  
iṉamētumilāṉai aṭaivatumē.

**English translation of verse 9.3.5:**

You, my mind, this sinner dire does entreat  
And tell in accent firm that you shall be resolute  
And attain the Lord of peerless charm, Who sports  
The lovely garland of tuḷaci, cool and fine  
That thrives so well on His charming person.

**Notes:**

Apprehending that his mind might treat his advice lightly and even brush it aside, the Āḻvār stresses again, the imperative need of its sticking to the Supreme Lord of exquisite charm, bedecked with tuḷaci garland, cool and fragrant. This is like entreating a person to drink the delicious milk. In Vaiṣṇava symbology, the holy tuḷaci wreath (Vaijayanti) is Lord Viṣṇu’s sovereign insignium, proclaiming His Universal Lordship. The great Nañcīyar would go into raptures on beholding Namperumāḷ, the mobile Deity in Śrīraṅgam. decked with tuḻaci wreaths, during the ceremonial processions. He would then recite this song which sent him into transport of joy.




## 9.3.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அடைவதும்அணியார் மலர்மங்கைதோள்  
மிடைவதும் அசுரர்க்குவெம்போர்களே  
கடைவதும் கடலுள்அமுதம் என்மனம்  
உடைவதும் அவற்கேஒருங்காகவே.

aṭaivatumaṇiyār malarmaṅkaitōḷ  
miṭaivatum acurarkkuvempōrkaḷē  
kaṭaivatum kaṭaluḷamutam eṉmaṉam  
uṭaivatum avaṟkēoruṅkākavē.

**English translation of verse 9.3.6:**

Thaws down my mind fully, steeped in contemplation  
Of the Lord’s dalliance with His bejewelled spouse, lotus-born,  
His encounters fierce with Acurars and His churning the ocean  
To grant unto Devas, ambrosia, out of deep compassion.

**Notes:**

The Āḻvār’s mind having responded to his appeal exceedingly well, he now describes its ecstatic reactions, in the course of its contemplation of the Lord’s glorious deeds and auspicious traits. The Āḻvār’s mind thaws down, as it dwells on the Lord’s tender solicitude even for the selfish and self-centred Devas and the enormous pains He had taken to churn the ocean and secure for them the ambrosia, longed for by them. According to Nampiḷḷai, it looks as if the Lord churned the Milk-ocean, just to churn the minds of devotees of the Āḻvār’s calibre and intensify their God-love.




## 9.3.7
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஆகம்சேர் நரசிங்கம்அதுஆகி ஓர்  
ஆகம்வள்உகிரால் பிளந்தான்உறை  
மாகவைகுந்தம் காண்பதற்கு என்மனம்  
ஏகம்எண்ணும் இராப்பகல்இன்றியே (2)

ākamcēr naraciṅkamatuāki ōr  
ākamvaḷukirāl piḷantāṉuṟai  
mākavaikuntam kāṇpataṟku eṉmaṉam  
ēkameṇṇum irāppakaliṉṟiyē (2)

**English translation of verse 9.3.7:**

‘Tween day and night, my mind makes no distinction,  
Yearn it does, all the time, to behold the high Heaven,  
The abode great of the Lord, Who did combine  
Man and lion in a single form and cleaved in twain,  
With nails sharp, yet another form (of Iraṇiyaṉ)

**Notes:**

\(i\) The Āḻvār says that his mind, which revelled in the contemplation of the Lord’s wondrous deeds, now longs to see the Lord in His transcendent glory, in the High Heavens.

\(ii\) It is indeed a very odd combination, outside the realm of possibility, the conjunction of Man and Lion, in a single frame. And yet, the Omnipotent Lord assumed such a Form, in His unbounded zeal for the welfare of Prahlāda, the young devotee, *par excellence*. Deeply implanted in the Āḻvār’s chastened mind, even at that distance of time, was the strange but highly delectable form of the Man-Lion (*Narasiṃha*)




## 9.3.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

இன்றிப்போக இருவினையும்கெடுத்து  
ஒன்றியாக்கைபுகாமை உய்யக்கொள்வான்  
நின்றவேங்கடம் நீள்நிலத்துஉள்ளது,  
சென்றதேவர்கள் கைதொழுவார்களே.

iṉṟippōka iruviṉaiyumkeṭuttu  
oṉṟiyākkaipukāmai uyyakkoḷvāṉ  
niṉṟavēṅkaṭam nīḷnilattuuḷḷatu,  
ceṉṟatēvarkaḷ kaitoḻuvārkaḷē.

**English translation of verse 9.3.8:**

Right in this sprawling world is the holy mount Vēṅkaṭam,  
Where stands the Lord, Who the devotees awaits and salves them,  
Clearing them of fruits, good and bad; Celestials they could be deemed,  
That unto the holy Mount repair and worship the Lord Supreme

**Notes:**

\(i\) In the preceding song, the Āḻvār longed for the vision of the Lord in Heaven but that would not be possible in this material body. The Lord, however, pointed out to the Āḻvār the possibility of his enjoying, right in this body, the Lord at Tiruvēṅkaṭam, in this very land. But the Āḻvār avers that it is only the stout-hearted Devas, who can remain stable and enjoy the Lord at Tiruvēṅkaṭam and that it would be next to impossible for men of his melting tenderness of heart, breaking down in ecstasy, eyes swimming with tears of delight and faltering legs, to steady themselves and worship Lord Veṅkaṭēśa. And so, according to the Āḻvār, Tiruvēṅkaṭam, though situated on Earth, affords little scope for worship, by one of his stance.

\(ii\) It is the Lord’s spontaneous grace that extricates the subjects from the clutches of the fruits of their good and bad actions which consign them to Svarga and hell, respectively. The one is as much an impediment as the other, to the final emancipation of the individual. The upaniṣads declare that the fruits, either way, have to be enjoyed by the individual soul, unless the Lord, in His redemptive grace, cuts them out and puts the subject in Heaven, with a clean slate, unencumbered in any way, by one thing or the other, ‘merit’ as well as ‘demerit’.




## 9.3.9
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

தொழுதுமாமலர் நீர்சுடர்தூபம்கொண்டு  
எழுதும்என்னும்இது மிகைஆதலின்  
பழுதுஇல்தொல்புகழ்ப் பாம்புஅணைப்பள்ளியாய்  
தழுவுமாறுஅறியேன் உனதாள்களே

toḻutumāmalar nīrcuṭartūpamkoṇṭu  
eḻutumeṉṉumitu mikaiātaliṉ  
paḻutuiltolpukaḻp pāmpuaṇaippaḷḷiyāy  
taḻuvumāṟuaṟiyēṉ uṉatāḷkaḷē

**English translation of verse 9.3.9:**

Oh, Lord, resting on serpent bed, ‘tis your ancient glory flawless  
That one can worship you with no effort; 1 am at a loss,  
How indeed I can your feet attain, for heavy you deem  
The ritualistic worship with flowers fine, lamp and fragrant fumes.

**Notes:**

The Lord refutes the stand taken by the Āḻvār, in the preceding song, that only Devas can possibly worship the Lord at Tiruvēṅkaṭam, by pointing out to him that even men of this world do go there and worship. But then, the Āḻvār is quick to realise that the Lord’s tender solicitude for His subjects is such that He deems even the simple service of offering flowers and sacramental water and burning incense before Him, much-too-heavy. This, the Āḻvār points out to the Lord and enquires of Him what service he could render unto Him. The Vedic text, ‘Bhūyiṣṭāṃ te namauktiṃ videma’ is interpreted, by some, as “we will utter, in plenty, the word ‘namaḥ’,” meaning that we do not belong to ourselves but exclusively to the Lord. The great Vaiṣṇava preceptors would, however, interpret it, in the light of this particular song, emphasising the Lord’s remarkable tenderness of heart and amazing solicitude for His subjects. Accordingly, the text in question is taken by them to mean: “We will utter the word ‘namaḥ’ which, according to Your extra-liberal standards, is too weighty a submission by us”. The prose order is arranged as “te bhūyiṣṭāṇṭ nama uktiṃ videma”, in order to get at this meaning. In fine, the Āḻvār says that it is well nigh impossible to render any service to the Lord, when one meditates on His remarkable tenderness of heart, which makes Him look upon even the simple offerings like flowers and water and burning incense as part of worship, as imposing a heavy burden on Him. This is indeed very true to His time-honoured fame, as One of easy worshippability.




## 9.3.10
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

தாளதாமரையான் உனதுஉந்தியான்  
வாள்கொள் நீளமழுஆளி உன்ஆகத்தான்  
ஆளராய்த்தொழுவாரும் அமரர்கள்  
நாளும் என்புகழ்கோ உனசீலமே?

vāḷkoḷ nīḷamaḻuāḷi uṉākattāṉ  
āḷarāyttoḻuvārum amararkaḷ  
nāḷum eṉpukaḻkō uṉacīlamē?

**English translation of verse 9.3.10:**

You do on your navel bear the one on lotus petal born  
While he who wields the trident, long and bright, does lean  
On your person; tender love you bear unto the Devas, who pose  
As your vassals; were I to laud your grace galore  
Till the end of time, would it exhaust your glory great?

**Notes:**

The Āḻvār is weighed down by the amazing simplicity of the Lord and His grace galore, extended even to the selfish Devas, the denizens of the upper worlds, and the self-centred Brahmā and Rudra, by holding the former right on His navel and by assigning a part of His body to the latter.

Surely, even persons, quite competent to sing the Lord’s praise, can never exhaust it, although they sing His glory for all time.




## 9.3.11
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

சீலம்எல்லைஇலான் அடிமேல் அணி  
கோலம்நீள் குருகூர்ச்சடகோபன் சொல்  
மாலைஆயிரத்துள் இவை பத்தினின்

**English translation of verse 9.3.11:**

‘Tis but natural that those somehow associated with these songs ten,  
Out of the thousand, in the hymnal garland of Kurukūr Caṭakōpān,  
Adoring the feet of the Lord of loving condescension  
And boundless compassion, do ascend the high Heaven.

**Notes:**

\(i\) This decad is in adoration of the Lord’s loving condescension which knows no limits. The Supreme Lord, higher than whom there is none, freely mingles, without any qualms, compunction or mental reservation, with the lowest of the lowly.

\(ii\) Contemplating the Lord’s grace galore, the Āḻvār also goes to the extent of asserting that even those, who are in some way, however remote, associated with these ten songs, will ascend the high Heaven, as a matter of course. It is not necessary that one should get these songs by wrote of heart or delve deep into their meanings for reaping the benefit of natural entry into Heaven, set out in this decad. It will suffice if one manages to remain in the place where these songs are sung, no matter even if one is inclined to doze about and gets actually landed in sleep. Even for such a person, Heaven becomes, as it were, the heir-loom, as Nampiḷḷai puts it, by way of driving home the benefit, spelt out in this end-song.
