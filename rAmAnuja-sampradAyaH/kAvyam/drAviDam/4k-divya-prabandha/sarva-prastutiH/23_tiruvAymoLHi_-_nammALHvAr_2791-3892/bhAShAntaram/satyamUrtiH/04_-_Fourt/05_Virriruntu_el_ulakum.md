## 00 Intro4.5
If the Āḻvār was seen in the last decad in a heavy state of depression, it was because the Lord intended it to be so. Even as hunger is the pre-requisite for consuming food, for God-enjoyment in its entirety, a consuming passion of the highest intensity, as seen in the climactic tenth decad of the tenth centum, is imperative. Meanwhile, what is happening is a course of Shock-treatment, working the Āḻvār up to the required pitch. By experiencing, alternately, the bliss of Divine presence and rapport and the cruel pangs of separation from Him, the Āḻvār’s appetite for God-enjoyment is whetted and his divine love and wisdom enriched all the time. If the Lord had stayed away from the Āḻvār altogether without obliging him with His vision, now and then, both the Lord and the world would have lost him. Apart from the afore-mentioned technique adopted by the Lord to enrich and intensify the Āḻvār’s God-love, his continued stay in this abode has enriched the world through his hymns of unparalleled excellence, a rich fare for the devotees revelling in sweet contemplation of the Lord’s auspicious traits and wondrous deeds. This is yet another purpose of the Lord in lengthening the Āḻvār’s stay in this abode. And so, we see in this decad the very antithesis of the Āḻvār’s harrowing experience in the last decad; his joy knows no bounds and leads him on to exclaim, “Could there be any want for me hereafter?”, “Is there any one equal to me in all the world?” and so on. The structure of this decad suggests that the Āḻvār is right at the peak of divine bliss and, in the opinion of Nañcīyar, this could as well have been the very last decad of this grand hymnal.

Unlike the spurious objects which misled the Āḻvār in the last decad, he now visualises the Lord’s cosmic wealth in all its facts. The Lord seems to call upon the Alvar to sing His glory to his heart’s fill, adding that His cosmic wealth can acquire special lustre only through his laudation. Accordingly, the Āḻvār sings, with cymbals in hand, and goes into raptures.




## 4.5.1
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வீற்றிருந்து ஏழ் உலகும் தனிக்கோல் செல்ல, வீவுஇல்சீர்,  
ஆற்றல் மிக்கு ஆளும் அம்மானை வெம் மா பிளந்தான் தன்னை,  
போற்றி என்றே கைகள் ஆரத் தொழுது சொல் மாலைகள்,  
ஏற்ற நோற்றேற்கு இனி என்ன குறை எழுமையுமே? (2)

vīṟṟiruntu ēḻ ulakum taṉikkōl cella, vīvuilcīr,  
āṟṟal mikku āḷum ammāṉai vem mā piḷantāṉ taṉṉai,  
pōṟṟi eṉṟē kaikaḷ ārat toḻutu col mālaikaḷ,  
ēṟṟa nōṟṟēṟku iṉi eṉṉa kuṟai eḻumaiyumē? (2)

**English translation of verse 4.5.1:**

Could there be any want for me for generations,  
Blest that I am to prostrate lustily, in benedictive adoration  
And offer besides hymnal garlands appropriate  
Unto the Lord, who the fierce horse-shaped fiend’s mouth smote  
The repository of auspicious attributes endless, seated in heaven,  
Holding sway unique over all he worlds with great serenity?

**Note**

Being in the happy position of lauding the Master of the entire universe and envisioning, right from here, the heavenly splendour, the Āḻvār feels he is above wants of any kind. For instance, in the last decad, with joined palms, the Nāyakī pointed to the mere sky as the heaven and now the void is more than filled, those hands being lustily fed by repeated salutation of the Lord in all His splendour. Supreme Sovereign though, the Lord is not a despot. He rules the worlds with quiet dignity and is exceedingly generous even as Śrī Rāma, the Lord in His incarnate Form, was at the disposal of the subjects.




## 4.5.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மைய கண்ணாள் மலர் மேல் உறைவாள் உறை மார்பினன்,  
செய்ய கோலத் தடங் கண்ணன் விண்ணோர் பெருமான் தன்னை,  
மொய்ய சொல்லால் இசைமாலைகள் ஏத்தி உள்ளப்பெற்றேன்,  
வெய்ய நோய்கள் முழுதும் வியன் ஞாலத்து வீயவே.

maiya kaṇṇāḷ malar mēl uṟaivāḷ uṟai mārpiṉaṉ,  
ceyya kōlat taṭaṅ kaṇṇaṉ viṇṇōr perumāṉ taṉṉai,  
moyya collāl icaimālaikaḷ ētti uḷḷappeṟṟēṉ,  
veyya nōykaḷ muḻutum viyaṉ ñālattu vīyavē.

**English translation of verse 4.5.2:**

Blest am I, while still in this sprawling land,  
To contemplate and laud thro’ hymnal garlands,  
Well set, the Lord of Celestials, with large eyes,  
Red and lovely, on whose chest always stays  
Lakṣmī, the lotus-born with collyrium in her eyes, well set  
And get all dire ills and evils rooted out.

**Notes**

\(i\) It is lakṣmī, the Goddess of plenty and riches, who adds lustre to the Lord’s glory by making His chest, her permanent abode. This glorious conjunction, which the Āḻvār praises, cures all ills and evils. If the Divine Mother looked at the Lord full in the face just once, the latter would feel exhilarated, cool and pleasant, as at the end of a heavy downpour. It is indeed a matter of reciprocity that Lakṣmī’s eyes are dark and the Lord’s eyes are red, the red complexion of the former having got transplanted in the eyes of the latter and the latter’s dark complexion having likewise been transposed, when they gazed at each other.

\(ii\) It is significant that there is no mention in the text, as to whose ills have been rooted out by the Āḻvār’s hymns. Evidently, it is intended to be of universal application and not parochial, benefiting the Āḻvār only, like the poor shade, thin and small, cast by the palmyrah tree.




## 4.5.3
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வீவு இல் இன்பம்மிக எல்லை நிகழ்ந்த நம் அச்சுதன்,  
வீவு இல் சீரன் மலர்க் கண்ணன் விண்ணோர் பெருமான் தன்னை,  
வீவு இல் காலம் இசைமாலைகள் ஏத்தி மேவப்பெற்றேன்,  
வீவு இல் இன்பம்மிக எல்லை நிகழ்ந்தனன் மேவியே.

vīvu il iṉpammika ellai nikaḻnta nam accutaṉ,  
vīvu il cīraṉ malark kaṇṇaṉ viṇṇōr perumāṉ taṉṉai,  
vīvu il kālam icaimālaikaḷ ētti mēvappeṟṟēṉ,  
vīvu il iṉpammika ellai nikaḻntaṉaṉ mēviyē.

**English translation of verse 4.5.3:**

Dwell do I at the very acme of bliss perennial,  
Having attained Accutan, my Lord, Chief of Celestials,  
Of limitless glory and eternal bliss, with red-lotus eyes,  
By incessant praise thro’ hymns mellifluous.

**Notes**

\(i\) The bliss that the Āḻvār experiences, as a result of singing Tiruvāymoḻi', is not merely unlimited but also supreme. Unlike the Veda Puruṣa, who attempted the impossible in trying to gauge the extent of the Lord’s bliss and had to acknowledge defeat, the Āḻvār has, right from the beginning, been declaring that the Lord is an inexhaustible fountain of bliss. And now, he finds that the bliss derived by him by singing the Lord’s praise through his scintillating hymns is also endless and supreme, there being nothing higher than this.

\(ii\) The tefl-tale lotus eyes of the Lord proclaim His Sovereignty over all the worlds. It is not as if there is none to enjoy the Lord’s charming eyes, like unto moon-shine wasted over the depopulated jungle, as we are likely to conclude, seeing the men over here turning their faces against Him; the whole lot of Celestials, the denizens in the yonder heaven, stand rivetted to these eyes, enthralled by their magic spell.




## 4.5.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மேவி நின்று தொழுவார் வினை போக மேவும் பிரான்,  
தூவி அம் புள் உடையான் அடல் ஆழி அம்மான் தன்னை,  
நா இயலால் இசைமாலைகள் ஏத்தி நண்ணப் பெற்றேன்,  
ஆவி என் ஆவியை யான் அறியேன் செய்த ஆற்றையே.

mēvi niṉṟu toḻuvār viṉai pōka mēvum pirāṉ,  
tūvi am puḷ uṭaiyāṉ aṭal āḻi ammāṉ taṉṉai,  
nā iyalāl icaimālaikaḷ ētti naṇṇap peṟṟēṉ,  
āvi eṉ āviyai yāṉ aṟiyēṉ ceyta āṟṟaiyē.

**English translation of verse 4.5.4:**

I know not how the Lord, inside my soul,  
Transformed it so as to sing His glory thro ‘hymns tuneful;  
The Supreme Benefactor that He is, He does mingle  
With those in Him absorbed and their sins destroys, one and all;  
Garuḍa, the bird with lovely plumes, is His mount  
And He holds in His hands, the discus valiant.

**Notes**

\(i\) The Lord gives Himself to those who long for Him exclusively, cutting out all other desires. All other desires gone, the sins also vanish. Oh, what a wonder, the Lord of the Eternal Heroes lavishes His bounty on a worldling like the Āḻvār, and the latter, a mere speck enjoys the bliss and beatitude, on a par with the infinite Lord, if not more!

\(ii\) The hymns come off effortlessly; the Āḻvār has only to set his tongue in motion, and there we have the mellifluous songs, sending the listeners, in all ages and climes, into raptures.




## 4.5.5
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஆற்ற நல்ல வகை காட்டும் அம்மானை, அமரர்தம்-  
ஏற்றை எல்லாப் பொருளும் விரித்தானை எம்மான் தன்னை,  
மாற்ற மாலைப் புனைந்து ஏத்தி நாளும் மகிழ்வு எய்தினேன்,  
காற்றின் முன்னம் கடுகி வினை நோய்கள் கரியவே.

āṟṟa nalla vakai kāṭṭum ammāṉai, amarartam-  
ēṟṟai ellāp poruḷum virittāṉai emmāṉ taṉṉai,  
māṟṟa mālaip puṉaintu ētti nāḷum makiḻvu eytiṉēṉ,  
kāṟṟiṉ muṉṉam kaṭuki viṉai nōykaḷ kariyavē.

**English translation of verse 4.5.5:**

Singing the praise of my Lord, Chief of Celestials,  
Who does unto His devotees, by stages, reveal  
The wholesome path of progress and knowledge sound impart,  
Thro’ hymnal garlands that do dense ills and evils cut out,  
Moving faster than wind. I feel for ever jubilant.

**Notes**

\(i\) That the Lord duly regulates the influx of His grace has been brought out at length, in the preamble to 1-9, quoting the relevant aphorism of ‘Ācārya-Hṛdayam’, which elucidates the theme admirably.

\(ii\) *The great truths*: In Bhagavad Gītā Lord Kṛṣṇa imparted to the world at large, through Arjuna, a volume of spiritual-knowledge—the distinction between the Supreme Lord and the Individual Soul (Jiva), the difference between the ‘Jīva’ and the non-sentient matter, immortality of the Soul, the Lord, as the Supreme Ordainer of all beings and things, controlling motion as well as rest, being easily attainable by devotees but difficult of attainment by others, differentiation between the Divine and the Devilish, equality in the eyes of the Lord, irrespective of caste, conduct and erudition, the path of loving surrender to His redemptive grace and all that.

\(iii\) All these benefits lavished by a loving Lord the Āḻvār could hardly repay, and hence he started lauding His great glory, which laudation assumed the form of ‘Tiruvāymoḻi’. Result: The miseries and the acts giving rise to them have all been expelled expeditiously.




## 4.5.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கரிய மேனிமிசை வெளிய நீறு சிறிதே இடும்,  
பெரிய கோலத் தடங்கண்ணன் விண்ணோர் பெருமான் தன்னை,  
உரிய சொல்லால் இசைமாலைகள் ஏத்தி உள்ளப்பெற்றேற்கு,  
அரியது உண்டோ எனக்கு இன்று தொட்டும் இனி என்றுமே?

kariya mēṉimicai veḷiya nīṟu ciṟitē iṭum,  
periya kōlat taṭaṅkaṇṇaṉ viṇṇōr perumāṉ taṉṉai,  
uriya collāl icaimālaikaḷ ētti uḷḷappeṟṟēṟku,  
ariyatu uṇṭō eṉakku iṉṟu toṭṭum iṉi eṉṟumē?

**English translation of verse 4.5.6:**

Could there be anything scarce for me, now and beyond.  
Blest that I am to praise thro’ hymnal garlands,  
In diction appropriate, the Chief of Celestials, my Lord  
Whose large eyes lovely are with collyrium gently smeared?

**Notes**

\(i\) To a question put by the Lord to the Āḻvār what he needs, pat goes the reply from him, saturated with divine bliss, that there is scarcely a thing he hasn’t got already and there would be nothing beyond attainment in the days to come. This depicts the mental state of the divine bard, in the realm of ecstasy, born of singing ‘Tiruvāymoḻi’, which stands on a pedestal of its own; It contains nothing but the praise of ‘Tirumāl’ (Lord Viṣṇu), in choice diction, true to the Āḻvār’s resolve in ‘Tiruviruttam’, the first of his four works. Indeed, he who is inspired by God Himself, becomes the most worthy instrument to praise Him; he becomes the Lord’s own poet. In his Rāmāyaṇa, Śri Vālmīki introduced quite a few extraneous anecdotes, such as the genesis of Gaṅga, birth of Kārthikeya and so on. Sage Vyāsa’s Mahābhārata also turned out to be a war-memoir, with a bewildering maze of episodes, instead of telling exclusively, the story of Nārāyaṇa, as the author had intended at the outset. Herein lies the superior merit of Tiruvāymoḻi.

\(ii\) The bewitching eyes of the Lord would certainly need no further beauty-aids and yet, there is the ceremonial application of collyrium.




## 4.5.7
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

என்றும் ஒன்று ஆகி ஒத்தாரும் மிக்கார்களும், தன் தனக்கு -  
இன்றி நின்றானை எல்லா உலகும் உடையான் தன்னை,  
குன்றம் ஒன்றால் மழை காத்த பிரானை சொல் மாலைகள்,  
நன்று சூட்டும் விதி எய்தினம் என்ன குறை நமக்கே?

eṉṟum oṉṟu āki ottārum mikkārkaḷum, taṉ taṉakku -  
iṉṟi niṉṟāṉai ellā ulakum uṭaiyāṉ taṉṉai,  
kuṉṟam oṉṟāl maḻai kātta pirāṉai col mālaikaḷ,  
naṉṟu cūṭṭum viti eytiṉam eṉṉa kuṟai namakkē?

**English translation of verse 4.5.7:**

Blest that we are to offer garlands of hymns  
Unto the Benefactor great, who repelled the rains,  
Holding the mount aloft, with none above or equal to Him,  
Sovereign master of all the worlds, who constant remains  
For ever, could there for us be any want?

**Notes**

\(i\) In the preceding song, the Āḻvār declared that he is free from wants of any kind and shall be above wants in the days to come as well. This night sound boastful but such a stance on his part is attributable to his authorship of the marvellous hymns, the Tiruvāymoḻi, which again is due to the Lord’s grace, a fact emphasised in this song.

\(ii\) The Lord is constant ard unchanging, whatever be His modes. In all His five manifestations, of ‘Para Vyūha’, ‘Vibhava’, ‘Antaryāmi’ and ‘Arcā’ the Lord has none above or equal to Him. Even so, it is in His Incarnate (Vibhava) Forms, that He excels. In fact, He excels in His trait of ‘Āśṛta-pāratantra’ (subservience to His devotees) for which His incarnations afford the maximum scope and there is hardly any equal for Him, in this respect.




## 4.5.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நமக்கும் பூவின்மிசை நங்கைக்கும் இன்பனை, ஞாலத்தார்-  
தமக்கும் வானத்தவர்க்கும் பெருமானை, தண் தாமரை-  
சுமக்கும் பாதப் பெருமானை சொல்மாலைகள் சொல்லுமாறு-  
அமைக்க வல்லேற்கு இனி யாவர் நிகர் அகல் வானத்தே?

namakkum pūviṉmicai naṅkaikkum iṉpaṉai, ñālattār-  
tamakkum vāṉattavarkkum perumāṉai, taṇ tāmarai-  
cumakkum pātap perumāṉai colmālaikaḷ collumāṟu-  
amaikka vallēṟku iṉi yāvar nikar akal vāṉattē?

**English translation of verse 4.5.8:**

Is there any one, even in the spacious heaven, equal to me  
Gifted with the capacity to compose hymns,  
Adoring the Lord, dear alike to us and the lotus-born (Lakṣmī)  
Sovereign Master of those in heaven and all other realms,  
Whose lovely feet the cool lotus bears?

**Notes**

\(i\) Seeing the Lord’s overwhelming love for him, the Āḻvār feels tempted to declare that there is none equal to him, the Lord’s poet, even in Heaven. The Lord’s love for His devotees is even greater than that borne by Him for Lakṣmi, His consort, as could be seen from the fact that we the devotees, are mentioned first, in the text of this song, Lakṣmī comes next. This is further elucidated in aphorism 122 of Ācarya Hṛdayam. This fact is also reinforced by an episode in Rāmāyaṇa. Standing on a mountain top overlooking Laṅkā, Sugrīva saw, for the first time, Rāvaṇa, on another hill-top, opposite. Swayed by the first impulse, Sugrīva leapt across and toppled down the crown of Rāvaṇa. Śri Rāma who witnessed that, gently reprimanded the Monkey-King, on his return, saying “what you have done is indeed something not expected of you. If Rāvaṇa had harmed you or humiliated you in any manner what use is there for me in reclaiming Sītā thereafter?” This clearly shows that Śri Rāma’s concern for Sugrīva was even greater than that for Sītā. Sītā would be of no consequence to Śri Rāma, once Sugrīva’s honour was compromised.

\(ii\) As already stated in III-1-1, the Lord’s feet stand poised on a lotus base. And here, the lotus is said to carry the Lord’s feet. This is because the Lord’s feet score over the lotus, in all respects-chillness, fragrance and tint. The lotus thus stands subjugated and carries its victor, the Lord’s feet.

\(iii\) The Āḻvār’s capacity to sing hymns is commendable, not because of his excellence as a poet, but because he could steady himself and sing, when called upon by the Lord to sing His praise, instead of thawing down in ecstasy. The Āḻvār’s poetic excellence is not emphasised here; actually, in the Seventh centum, ninth decad, the Āḻvār says that it is the Lord who sings His own glory, keeping the Āḻvār as but His mouthpiece.




## 4.5.9
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வானத்தும் வானத்துள் உம்பரும் மண்ணுள்ளும் மண்ணின்கீழ்த்  
தானத்தும், எண் திசையும் தவிராது நின்றான் தன்னை,  
கூனல் சங்கத் தடக்கையவனை குடம் ஆடியை  
வானக் கோனை, கவி சொல்ல வல்லேற்கு இனி மாறுஉண்டே?

vāṉattum vāṉattuḷ umparum maṇṇuḷḷum maṇṇiṉkīḻt  
tāṉattum, eṇ ticaiyum tavirātu niṉṟāṉ taṉṉai,  
kūṉal caṅkat taṭakkaiyavaṉai kuṭam āṭiyai  
vāṉak kōṉai, kavi colla vallēṟku iṉi māṟuuṇṭē?

**English translation of verse 4.5.9:**

Is there a poet on a par with me,  
Singing the glory of the Lord, pervading everywhere,  
Top, middle and bottom, all things, all over,  
Holding in His hand hefty the spiral conch lovely,  
The pot-dancer entrancing, Chief of the Celestials?

**Notes**

\(i\) The Āḻvār is the peerless poet, singing the Lord’s glory embiacing all His five aspects of ‘Para’ (transcendent), Vyūha (Operative), Vibhava (Incarnate), ‘Antaryāmi’ (Internal Controller) and ‘Arca’ (Iconic) Forms. The ‘Nityas’ (Eternal Heroes) and ‘Muktas’ (Released Souls), in Heaven, confine themselves to the transcendent glory of the Lord; Sages like Parāśara and Vyāsa recount only Lord Kṛṣṇa’s glory even as Sage Vālmīki stands rivetted to Śri Rāma’s. Sages Sanaka, Sanandana and others of that group sing the praise of the Lord as the Internal Controller. Thus Nammāḻvār, stands out as the only poet covering all the aspects of the Lord. It is also noteworthy that the Āḻvār repeatedly refers to the Lord’s inmanence, full and complete, setting at naught the controversial view held by some that the Lord’s pervasion is only partial and not complete.

\(ii\) ‘*Spiral conch*’ stands for all the Lord’s effulgent weapons, like discus, mace etc, even as ‘Pot-dancing’ stands for all the other activities of Lord Kṛṣṇa.Translation




## 4.5.10
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

உண்டும் உமிழ்ந்தும் கடந்தும் இடந்தும் கிடந்தும் நின்றும்,  
கொண்ட கோலத்தொடு வீற்றிருந்தும் மணம் கூடியும்,  
கண்ட ஆற்றால் தனதே உலகு என நின்றான் தன்னை,  
வண் தமிழ் நூற்க நோற்றேன் அடியார்க்கு இன்ப மாரியே.

uṇṭum umiḻntum kaṭantum iṭantum kiṭantum niṉṟum,  
koṇṭa kōlattoṭu vīṟṟiruntum maṇam kūṭiyum,  
kaṇṭa āṟṟāl taṉatē ulaku eṉa niṉṟāṉ taṉṉai,  
vaṇ tamiḻ nūṟka nōṟṟēṉ aṭiyārkku iṉpa māriyē.

**English translation of verse 4.5.10:**

Joy do I rain on devotees thro’ Tamil hymns fine,  
I have the fortune to compose, adoring Him, who, from time to time,  
Ate, spat, spanned and pulled out the worlds,  
Who (as Rāma) lay (on sea-front) and (victorious) stood  
(on the battlefield) and then sat for long, on the throne,  
Acts which, on the fact, proclaim Him as Sovereign Supreme.

**Notes**

\(i\) The Āḻvār feels doubly blessed, in that he not only renders service unto the Lord, by word of mouth, (Vācika Kaiṅkarya) but also regales His devotees, through his hymns. The Lord’s wondrous deeds and marvellous achievements, the Āḻvār recounts rapidly but with great ease. The Lord sustained, in His stomach, all the worlds, for the duration of the deluge and then let them out; He measured the worlds in three strides and on another occasion, retrieved the Earth from the ocean; He prostrated in front of the Indian ocean, invoking the help of the king of the ocean to bund it and cross over to Laṅkā and stood victorious, after Rāvaṇa was slain, granting audience to the Celestials, gathered in the outer space. After His return from exile Śrī Rāma ruled this land for eleven thousand years and thus graced the earth, rather held Mother Earth in His embrace. All these deeds of the Lord clearly establish His Sovereignty over the entire Universe, even as we recognise the earthly owners of lands from their various dealings, connected with the lands.

\(ii\) The Āḻvār is the joyous cloud, unleashing the rain of joy upon the Lord’s devotees through Tiruvāymoḻi.




## 4.5.11
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மாரி மாறாத தண் அம் மலை வேங்கடத்து அண்ணலை,  
வாரி மாறாத பைம் பூம் பொழில்சூழ் குருகூர் நகர்க்,  
காரி மாறன் சடகோபன் சொல் ஆயிரத்து இப் பத்தால்,  
வேரி மாறாத பூமேல் இருப்பாள் வினை தீர்க்குமே.

māri māṟāta taṇ am malai vēṅkaṭattu aṇṇalai,  
vāri māṟāta paim pūm poḻilcūḻ kurukūr nakark,  
kāri māṟaṉ caṭakōpaṉ col āyirattu ip pattāl,  
vēri māṟāta pūmēl iruppāḷ viṉai tīrkkumē.

**English translation of verse 4.5.11:**

Lakṣmī, the lotus-born, of perpetual fragrance, will help those that learn  
These songs ten, out of the thousand composed by Caṭakōpaṉ,  
Of Kurukūr, with perennial water and big gardens,  
Full of flowers lovely, lauding the Lord at Vēṅkaṭam, the mountain  
Cool and lovely, with continual rain, to get rid of all sins.

**Notes**

\(i\) There is no mention in any of the ten preceding songs, about the Lord enshrined in Tiruvēṅkaṭam, and yet, in this end-song, the Lord, in His iconic Form, has been referred to. This only shows that the emphasis rests on ‘Arca’ throughout ‘Tiruvāymoḻi’. In the eighth stanza of this decad, the amazing extent of God’s condescending love, giving precedence to the worldlings over even the Divine Mother, was alluded to. The Lord at Tiruvēṅkaṭam is the very personification of such condescending love, and He has, therefore, been referred to in this end-stanza. Continual rains in Tiruvēṅkaṭam ensure the abundance of water for all time in Kurukūr (Tirunakarī), the birth place of the Āḻvār, and because of this plentiful supply of water, the fragrance of the lotus-flower on which Lakṣmī, the Divine Mother is seated, is undiminishing. (Grand poetic imagery indeed!)

\(ii\) The text, as in the original, is misconstrued by some as placing the Divine Mother on a par with the Lord, in regard to the grant of ‘Mokṣa’. Hers is only a recommendatory role and she can only be instrumental in our attaining Mokṣa at the hands of the Lord whose indivisible and inalienable prerogative is ‘*Mokṣa pradatva*’ (grant of Mokṣa). The following is the elucidation of Śrīmān Nigamānta Deśika, in his commentary on Saint Yāmuna’s Catuś Ślokī’ in regard to this point. “It is the sole prerogative of the Lord to reward or punish the subjects, in the light of their ‘Karma’, the good and bad deeds. The Merciful Mother, however, makes admirable use of her position and privilege and gets the reward magnified and the punishment minimised through her good offices.”

The chanters of this decad are thus quite safe under the apron of the Divine Mother, the sure deliverer of the goods.
