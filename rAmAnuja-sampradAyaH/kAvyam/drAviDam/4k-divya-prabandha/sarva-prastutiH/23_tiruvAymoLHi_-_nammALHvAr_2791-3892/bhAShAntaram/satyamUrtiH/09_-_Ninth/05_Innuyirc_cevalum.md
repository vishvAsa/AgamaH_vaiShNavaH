## 00 Intro9.5
The Lord pulled the Āḻvār out of his erstwhile dejection, by reminding him of the great felicity, conferred by Him. This refers to the Āḻvār’s great role in singing these hymns for the delectation of the devout. The Āḻvār also felt gratified that it was indeed a great gift of the loving Lord and this sustained the Āḻvār for the time being, as we saw in the last decad. But then, in the eighth song of that decad, the Āḻvār referred to his having got the vision of Lord Kṛṣṇa, a by-gone Avatāra (Incarnation). This led him on to the desire for external perception of the Lord as well, without being confined to a mere mental vision. It did not, however, materialise, as the Lord was intent upon rousing theĀḻvār’s appetite for Him to still further heights, before He would eventually present Himself physically. Worn out by dejection, due to this seeming desertion by the Lord, the Āḻvār tried to divert his mind by seeking the fellowship of things around, bearing the Lord's likeness. But the very things, chosen for diversion, served only as incentives to remind the Āḻvār, all the more, about the Lord and thus torment him. The Āḻvār’s sad predicament in IV-4 is worth recalling, in this context.

In his present love-smitten mood, the Āḻvār is like unto a female-lover, separated from the Lord after their erstwhile union, trying to sustain herself in the sweet environments of a lovely garden. But there, the warbling koel and the blue peacock remind the forlorn lover of the Lord’s sweet accents and charming complexion and she at once concludes that the Lord has set these creatures on her, just to make her collapse, pining for Him. She, therefore, asks them why they are at such great pains to put an end to her life which she would as well part with, at her own volition. Even so, the Nāyakī manages to pull through, recounting, in this decad, the Lord’s auspicious traits.

Here is an interesting anecdote, revealing how fascinating this decad was for Saint Rāmānuja. Once a misunderstanding arose between him and the temple minstrel-in-chief, Āḻvār Tiruvaraṅkapperumāḷ Araiyar, resulting in the Saint’s discontinuance of his visits to the Temple of Lord Raṅganātha at Śrīraṅgam. The Araiyar, who was anxious to appease Rāmānuja, hit upon a special device whereby the Saint could be brought round and made to visit the temple. News was sent to the Saint that, on a certain day, this particular decad would be featured in the day’s service at the temple. Rāmānuja promptly attended the service and peace between him and the Araiyar was thus restored. So great was the hold, this decad had on the Saint.




## 9.5.1
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

இன்னுயிர்சேவலும் நீரும் கூவிக்கொண்டு இங்கு எத்தனை  
என்னுயிர் நோவ மிழற்றேல்மின் குயில் பேடைகாள்  
என்னுயிர்க் கண்ணபிரானை நீர் வரக்கூவுகிலீர்

**English translation of verse 9.5.1:**

Ye, female Koel-birds, do not my soul torment,  
Cooing around here along with your mates dear;  
Lord Kaṇṇan, dear unto me like life, You bid not  
To come and meet me and yet, why are you in great flutter,  
To sap my life and unto Him hand it out?

**Notes:**

Seeing the female Koel-birds, in the company of their male counterparts, is enough to torment the forlorn lover, that Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī is. If, on the top of this, these birds, well-mated, start cooing their love-notes as well, it would indeed be the farthest limit of forbearance for the desolate Nāyakī. Well, it might be argued that it is not the fault of these birds that they keep cooing, being in their native element. But then, the Nāyakī’s grievance is that these birds, given to cooing in sweet accents, did not oblige her by calling out her bosom Lord to come and join her. Verily, these birds are out to sap her life which the Nāyakī is prepared to give up of her own accord and she, therefore, feels that the birds need not make such a mighty effort, to accomplish their object. What they do is like applying heroic remedies for petty maladies, such as breaking an egg with a club.




## 9.5.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

இத்தனை வேண்டுவதுஅன்றுஅந்தோ! அன்றில் பேடைகாள்  
எத்தனை நீரும் நும்சேவலும் கரைந்துஏங்குதிர்  
வித்தகன் கோவிந்தன் மெய்யன்அல்லன் ஒருவர்க்கும்  
அத்தனைஆம் இனி என்உயிர் அவன்கையதே.

vittakaṉ kōvintaṉ meyyaṉallaṉ oruvarkkum  
attaṉaiām iṉi eṉuyir avaṉkaiyatē.

**English translation of verse 9.5.2:**

Ye, Aṉṟil birds, is it at all meet  
That you should with your male partners mate,  
Right in front of me and warble my life out?  
Alas! Kōvintaṉ, the mystic Lord isn’t true to any one,  
My life is in His keeping and help I need from none.

**Notes:**

The Koel-birds kept silent, in response to the Nāyakī’s appeal. Meanwhile, the Krauñca (Aṉṟil) birds started warbling along with their inseparable male partners. The Nāyakī chides them, saying that neither the female nor the male is any better than the Koel-birds and wants to know why they are all out to kill her. The birds tried to beat back the Nāyakī’s admonition by pointing out that she should not make all this fuss over her temporary separation from the Lord, seeing that He covets her company so much that He could not bear being away from her for long. In her present state of deep dejection, the Nāyakī is in no mood be believe that the Lord is most easily accessible unto the devout and beyond the reach of others. She reshapes the slogan and avers that He is true to none and is hardly the Universal Saviour, He is believed to be. And yet, He is so enigmatic that He can neither be clung to, as the Saviour nor be given up, as being antagonistic. Either way, her life is in His keeping and, therefore, she does not need the help of these birds or, for the matter of that, of any one else. Actually, the Lord’s dispensation, in any form, is always welcome to His true devotees, who have realised their essential nature, as His exclusive vassals, solely dependent on Him. Lord Kṛṣṇa’s proverbial mendacity is as wholesome to them as Lord Rāma’s classical veracity, both being beneficial.




## 9.5.3
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அவன்கையதே எனதுஆர்உயிர் அன்றில் பேடைகாள்  
எவன்சொல்லி நீர்குடைந்துஆடுதிர் புடைசூழவே  
தவம்செய்தில்லா வினையாட்டியேன் உயிர் இங்குஉண்டோ

evaṉcolli niṟṟum numēṅku kūkkural kēṭṭumē.

**English translation of verse 9.5.3:**

Know Ye not, Oh, female Aṉṟil birds,  
My life is entirely in His hands;  
Why do you unto your mates talk love  
Within my hearing and pull poor me down?  
My life is well on the point of ebbing out,  
Alas! the felicity this sinner lacks of keeping it *intact*.  
Can I at all subsist even after hearing your love-notes?

**Notes:**

The female Krauñca (Aṉṟil) birds, flirting with their males, present a picture entirely different from that of the Nāyakī, sunk deep in dejection. It is only when these birds tasted the bitter fruit of separation from their mates, they would realise the sad plight of the Nāyakī and sympathise with her. It is indeed much more than she can bear, these birds making merry, right in front of her. What is worse, unlike the Lord who wouldn’t mind His separation from the Nāyakī, for a while, the Nāyakī has not been endowed with the capacity to put up with even such momentary desertion by her beloved Lord and remain complacent. The Nāyakī feels that her life is ebbing out and that these birds, warbling their love-notes, are hell-bent to take her life out, not knowing that her life is in His hands. Did not the Āḻvār observe, in IV-3-8, “Oh, Lord, You made my soul Yours and Yours mine”?




## 9.5.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கூக்குரல்கேட்டும் நம்கண்ணன் மாயன் வெளிப்படான்  
மேல்கிளை கொள்ளேல்மின் நீரும் சேவலும் கோழிகாள்  
வாக்கும்மனமும் கருமமும் நமக்குஆங்கதே

ākkaiyum āviyum antaram niṉṟuuḻalumē

**English translation of verse 9.5.4:**

Ye, parrots, even Your amorous shouts  
Haven’t unto me brought Kaṇṇaṉ, our mystic Lord,  
Why then do you still coo so loud from that height?  
My word, deed and thought are beside Him sheltered  
But left in the lurch, my body and soul struggle a lot.

**Notes:**

The Nāyakī wonders why the amorous shouts of these merry birds, which could be heard all over, did not stir up her Lord’s emotions, in the same way as she reacted. She admonishes the parrots not to warble any more, in such high pitch and torment her, seeing that their cooings had not evoked the Lord’s response. The parrots would not, however, obey the Nāyakī and persisted in shouting. Apprehending that these birds were bent upon teasing her, the Nāyakī disclosed to them that her triple faculties of speech, thought and action had already fled over to the Lord and that the birds would, therefore, do well to shift their scene of activity to where her Lord was. The parrots could not swallow this statement of the Nāyakī, seeing that she was actually talking to them. The Nāyakī clarified that her body and soul were just tottering at this end and that she didn’t exist, in the real sense.




## 9.5.5
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அந்தரம் நின்றுஉழல்கின்ற யானுடைப் பூவைகாள்  
நும்திறத்துஏதும் இடைஇல்லை குழறேல்மினோ  
இந்திரஞாலங்கள் காட்டி இவ்ஏழ்உலகும் கொண்ட

nam tirumārpaṉ namāvi uṇṇa naṉkueṇṇiṉāṉ.

**English translation of verse 9.5.5:**

My pet Pūvai birds, You don’t have to sing and torment me,  
For the Lord, Who on His chest holds Tiru (Mahālakṣmī)  
Has indeed planned well ahead to finish me off,  
Even as He did the seven worlds get hold of,  
Playing many a wily trick (on Mahābali).

**Notes:**

The Nāyakī points out to her pet birds, the futility of their attempts to torment her, as she already stands tormented by her beloved Lord, well set on the path of ending her altogether. In her present state of discomfiture, the  
Nāyakī puts some strange construction on the Lord bearing Mahālakṣmī, His principal Spouse, on His broad chest. This was just to lull the Nāyakī into a sense of false security, by an outward display of His connubial affections. Likewise, she lashes at the Lord, as a downright strategist who seized all the worlds from Mahābali, on the sly. Did He not extend false hopes to her of ever-lasting companionship, during His erstwhile union with her? If this was the ruse, set up by no less than the omnipotent Lord to finish off the Nāyakī, should He need the help of any one else and much less, the help of these tiny birds, to accomplish His task?




## 9.5.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நன்குஎண்ணி நான்வளர்த்த சிறுகிளிப்பைதலே  
இன்குரல் நீ மிழற்றேல் என்ஆர்உயிர்க் காகுத்தன்

niṉceyya vāyokkum vāyaṉ kaṇṇaṉkai kāliṉaṉ  
niṉpacumcāma niṟattaṉ kūṭṭuṇṭu nīṅkiṉāṉ.

**English translation of verse 9.5.6:**

Methought you would unto my aid come in times of need.  
And so, my tiny little parrot, You I did lovingly tend;  
Sing no more, in my presence, in your tone sweet and remind  
Me of Kākuttaṉ, dear as life, of a complexion like yours,  
Whose lips are like unto your beak red, whose eyes,  
Hands and feet resemble yours, who was in my embrace locked  
But has now from me fled, oh, how wicked!

**Notes:**

The young parrot, lovingly tended by the Nāyakī and taught by her to spell out the Lord’s names, prattles the Lord’s names in the Nāyakī’s hearing. Poor little thing, it does not know that it hardly suits her, in her present state of mental agony due to her separation from the Lord. Actually, the Lord’s names, mouthed by the faithful parrot, just pierce the Nāyakī, like sharp spears, as Nampiḷḷai would put it. The Nāyakī chicks the parrot for inflicting such agony on her, like unto the young one attempting to kill the mother. It would, of course, be a different story altogether if the parrot performed likewise when the saint is in the blessed state of communion with the Lord.




## 9.5.7
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கூட்டுண்டு நீங்கிய கோலத்தாமரைக் கண்செவ்வாய்  
வாட்டம்இல்என் கருமாணிக்கம் கண்ணன் மாயன்போல்  
கோட்டிய வில்லொடு மின்னும் மேகக்குழாங்கள்காள்  
காட்டேல்மின் நும்உரு என்உயிர்க்கு அதுகாலனே.

kāṭṭēlmiṉ numuru eṉuyirkku atukālaṉē.

**English translation of verse 9.5.7:**

Ye bunches of clouds with lightning streaks that gleam  
Like silvery bows, well bent! show me not your form,  
Which unto my life is like Kālaṉ,the angel of Death, one dreads,  
For you bear the likeness of Kaṇṇaṉ, my mystic Lord,  
Who after His erstwhile union with me has fled,  
Whose sapphire hue, lotus eyes and lips red  
Are, however, in my thoughts for ever.

**Notes:**

\(i\) When the silvery lightning cleaves the bosom of the dark clouds, one cannot but recollect the exquisite form of Lord Kṛṣṇa of Sapphire hue, bedecked with dazzling ornaments. The Nāyakī, therefore, asks the clouds not to present themselves to her, as it would prove fatal to her.

\(ii\) During their erstwhile union, when the Nāyakī and the Lord were locked in tight embrace, it looked as if they would never get parted. But then, the Lord deserted her and, in the process, He stood to gain. Already known for His exquisite charm, each one of His limbs, shone with even greater lustre after His union with the Nāyakī. On the other hand, the Nāyakī fared miserably. The Lord’s desertion has affected her mind and body so much, that the bangles would not rest on her wrists, grown terribly thin, and her natural complexion has faded out alarmingly, decoloration having set in.




## 9.5.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

உயிர்க்குஅது காலன்என்று உம்மை யான்இரந்தேற்குநீர்  
குயில் பைதல்காள் கண்ணன் நாமமே குழறிக்கொன்றீர்  
தயிர்ப்பழஞ்சோற்றொடு பால்அடிசிலும் தந்து சொல்

payiṟṟiya nalvaḷamūṭṭiṉīr paṇpuuṭaiyīrē!

**English translation of verse 9.5.8:**

Ye, young Koel-birds, I did entreat you not to utter  
The name of Kaṇṇaṉ and put me in a flutter,  
And yet, His name You spell and me You do slaughter;  
Well, this is how you return my kindness, you I did feed  
With curd and rice, cold and cooked with milk, I did also teach  
How to utter the Lord’s name; how nice of you indeed!

**Notes:**

In her present state of desolation, the Nāyakī is in no mood to listen to the Lord’s name being chanted by any one and much less, her own pet birds, particularly, the name of Lord Kṛṣṇa. The Nāyakī reared up the birds with curd, rice and milk and taught them also how to utter the Lord’s names, Rāma, Kṛṣṇa and so on. A little while ago, the Nāyakī had asked these birds not to utter the name of kṛṣṇa, so dear to her and yet, very bitter in her present state. The name of Rāma, the elixir of life, the Redeemer of even the dead was, however, permitted by her, as it would help to sustain her and pull through. The birds, however, pronounced only Kṛṣṇa’s name, with a vengeance, the Nāyakī could hardly make out and it is this that she calls massacre, pure and simple. The Nāyakī naturally feels vexed that these birds, on whom she had lavished a lot of affection and attention, should now do her a bad turn.




## 9.5.9
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

பண்புடை வண்டொடு தும்பிகாள் பண்மிழற்றேல்மின்

**English translation of verse 9.5.9:**

Ye, humming bees and beetles, Your tone, though sweet,  
Is unto me agonising like the spear, driven into the wound straight,;  
Right-minded that you are, You shall sing no more;  
Of eyes, large and lovely, like the blooming lotus in the pond,  
Kaṇṇaṉ, my Lord, did my life snatch and abscond.

**Notes:**

Fed well on the honey gathered from the flowers in bloom, the sonorous bees hum nicely and it would indeed be a treat to the Nāyakī if she were in the company of her beloved Lord. But now, He is not merely away from her but has also stolen away her heart, by exhibiting His exquisite charm, particularly, His large and lovely eyes like unto the lotus, in fullbloom, in a big pond full of cool water. The Nāyakī finds the humming of the bees quite agonising, in her present state, and appeals to their good sense to desist from humming.




## 9.5.10
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

எழநண்ணி நாமும் நம்வானநாடனோடு ஒன்றினோம்  
பழன நல்நாரைக் குழாங்கள்காள் பயின்றுஎன்இனி

**English translation of verse 9.5.10:**

Ye, herds of herons, roaming in water-logged fields,  
There’s no use your conspiring against me any more;  
Joined have I my Lord in Heaven, having given up this abode,  
This body with jewels bedecked will stay here no more,  
May this land prosper and enjoy lasting happiness, all over!

**Notes:**

\(i\) Seeing a band of herons moving about, the Nāyakī felt that they had assembled together just to hatch a conspiracy against her, with a view to ending her life. She, however, hastened to tell them that there was hardly any need for it, as she had already gained access to the high Heaven. Questioned by the herons as to how she could make such a daring statement, while still in this abode, the Nāyakī enlightens them by asserting that her soul had already ascended Heaven and what they were beholding was only her body which too would fall off, in a day or two.

\(ii\) The last line of this song has been interpreted in three different ways by the great Ācāryas: (*a*) According to Saint Yāmunācārya, the great souls, bound for Heaven, would bless, on the eve of their ascent, the people over here, with all joy and prosperity. The Āḻvār just followed in their footsteps, when he made this benedictory statement.

(*b*) Saint Rāmānujācārya, however, thought that the Āḻvār only wished that the worldlings should be spared all the miseries and vicissitudes, gone through by him, soaked in God-love. Ironically speaking, the Āḻvār wished the men of this world, all joy, by keeping their hands off God-love.

(*c*) Parāśara Bhaṭṭārya opined that the people around were moved to pity, on seeing the Āḻvār’s sad plight and very much wished that the Lord be pleased to hasten his delivery. But the Āḻvār retorted and told them that they need not commiserate with him any more, as he was at the fag end of his heaven-ward journey, the consummation of his God-love being near at hand and wished them all joy.




## 9.5.11
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

**English translation of verse 9.5.11:**

Listeners, in all three worlds, of these songs nine plus one,  
Out of the thousand of Kurukūr Caṭakōpaṉ,  
Adoring the Lord, Who the eternal bliss confers, pervading all over,  
And did on him His grace sweet shower,  
That he might His praise sing till the end of eternity.  
Will surely thaw down, however hard-hearted they might be.

**Notes:**

It may be recalled that, in the end song of VI-8 also, the benefit accrued by dint of chanting that decad was said to be the acquisition of the rare virtue of melting tenderness of heart, making it thaw down like the minute sands in water springs. It is indeed the Lord’s grace galore that enables His devotees to sing His inexhaustible glory for aḷl time. Even among these ten songs, the tenth stands on a special footing and is of unique grandeur. That is why the text of this song refers to the ten stanzas, in this decad, as the sum of nine and one, bringing out the grandeur of one stanza *vis-a-vis* the other nine. In the first nine songs, we saw the Nāyakī struggling to sustain herself through her association with things and creatures bearing the Lord’s likeness, while in the tenth, she felt as though life was extinct and what remained was the mere body, ready to fall off.
