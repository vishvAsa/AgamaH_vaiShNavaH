## 00 Intro10.6
As the great Nampiḷḷai would put it, in his inimitable diction, the stage has now been reached when the Lord is in hot pursuit of the Āḻvār. The position hitherto, commencing from the opening song of the Āḻvār’s first hymnal (Tiruviruttam) was, however, just the reverse, that is, the Āḻvār was seeking out the Lord and pursuing Him doggedly. The Āḻvār, who was the supplicant before, is now vigorously sought after by the Lord Whose love for the great savant knows no bounds, vide the 3rd song of this decad, which highlights the speed with which the Lord wishes to take the Āḻvār, to the heavenly abode. In the exuberance of His love for the Āḻvār, the Lord would even think in terms of lifting him bodily to heaven. The Āḻvār had to plead with the Lord to give up His overambitious project and he advised Him not to defile the sanctity of Heaven by introducing therein his physical body. What is even more astounding is the Lord’s extreme fascination for the Āḻvār’s physical body, the last of the staggering number of bodies, tenanted by him, that led Him on to seek the Āḻvār’s permission to enjoy his body, limb by limb. For this purpose, the Lord would assume a number of Forms, as He did during the famous ‘*RĀSAKRĪḌĀ*’ dance with the damsels of Vrindāvan and again, when He married sixteen thousand pretty ladies and led the life of a typical householder with each one of them, all at once, in the holy island of Dvāraka, a township raised by Lord Kṛṣṇa Himself from the bed of the Sea.

If we probed a little into the relative stance of the Āḻvār and the Lord, it can easily be discovered that the Āḻvār’s yearning for the Lord dwindles down to insignificant proportions, as compared to the all-conquering love, which the Lord bears for him. Actually, this has already been succinctly brought out in IX-6-10. Well, if the Lord bore such inordinate love for the Āḻvār, defying description, and still kept him on in this abode, it was only in the larger interests of mankind, as a whole, their uplift through the Āḻvār’s scintillating, soul-stirring songs. Now that this purpose has been achieved, the Lord can no longer resist the deep urge in Him to expedite the Āḻvār’s uplift to Heaven. As a matter of fact, the Lord is already well on the move, having come to nearby Tiruvāṭṭāṟu, the vantage point for lifting the Āḻvār to Heaven. Of course, the Lord could as well confer on the Āḻvār, heavenly bliss, right here, but, in the very nature of things, this land of dark nescience is not the place for the Lord’s uninterrupted enjoyment of the Āḻvār. Even so, He would want the Āḻvār to command Him to take him to Heaven. In other words, He wishes to confer on him heavenly bliss and beatitude, in a spirit of service unto the Āḻvār and not as a matter of grace.

The Āḻvār is, however, not the one who would make any gesture of the kind which militates against his creed of complete self-abnegation, resulting from his total dependence on the Lord Whose will is paramount. Put in a nutshell, the position is like this:

> *Lord to Āḻvār*: “Oh, Āḻvār, won’t you beckon Me to take you on to the
> heavenly abode?”

The Āḻvār ponders within himself: “How amazing and how incredible that the Sovereign Lord seeks my permission and wants to play a subordinate role! Shall I not meet my fellow-men and talk to them about this and make them also appreciate and admire the Lord’s simplicity galore and tender solicitude? But then, these fellows are hardly available to me for sharing my wonderful experience, immersed, as they are, in wordly pleasures. And how about the Lord? Shall I not pour out my mind to the Lord Himself, expatiating on this wonderful gesture of His? Alas! He too is heavily pre-occupied, fiercely concentrating on how best He can expedite my ascent to heaven. Let me, in the last resort, open up a dialogue with my own God-bent mind and impress upon it the amazing simplicity of the Supreme Lord, the immensity of the love borne by Him unto me and the resultant benefits accrued to me”.

In short, the Āḻvār had hitherto looked upon the Lord, as the sole ordainer, of unbridled independence, but now he realises that the Lord is but the abject servant of His devotees and gives vent to his hearty appreciation of the Lord’s tender solicitude and amazing simplicity.




## 10.6.1
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அருள்பெறுவார் அடியார் தம் அடியனேற்கு ஆழியான்-  
அருள்தருவான் அமைகின்றான் அதுநமது விதிவகையே  
இருள்தருமா ஞாலத்துள் இனிப்பிறவி யான்வேண்டேன்  
மருள்ஒழி நீமடநெஞ்சே! வாட்டாற்றான் அடிவணங்கே. (2)

aruḷpeṟuvār aṭiyār tam aṭiyaṉēṟku āḻiyāṉ-  
aruḷtaruvāṉ amaikiṉṟāṉ atunamatu vitivakaiyē  
iruḷtarumā ñālattuḷ iṉippiṟavi yāṉvēṇṭēṉ  
maruḷoḻi nīmaṭaneñcē! vāṭṭāṟṟāṉ aṭivaṇaṅkē. (2)

**English translation of verse 10.6.1:**

The Lord, Who does the discus wield, graciously insists  
On salving me, the vassal of His devotees, who on His grace subsist;  
He would want me to order Him about! I shan’t desire  
Birth in this land of dark nescience any more,  
The feet of the Lord at Tiruvāṭṭāṟu, do adore  
And yield not, Oh, fickle mind, to the thought, that allures,  
Of enjoying the Supreme Lord, right from here.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The Āḻvār cajoles his mind to revel, along with him, in the enjoyment of the Lord’s glorious trait of loving condescension, in the following terms:

> “Don’t you see that the Lord is all agog to confer on me the supreme
> bliss, and that too, at my dictation? Oh, what a trait and how
> glorious! There is none over here with whom I can share my jubilation
> over this wonderful trait of the Lord. Would you, therefore, come
> along with me to the Eternal Land (Heaven) where we can appropriately
> share this exulation with the exalted and enlightened denizens over
> there? The Lord wants to get hold of me as firmly as He wields the
> lovely discus. In other words, He shall give me up only if He gave up
> the valiant discus. Actually, He sheds on me the aggregate of the love
> He bears unto the discus and other exalted members of that holy band,
> known as Eternal Heroes (Nitya Sūrīs). Well, do you know how this has
> come about? Surely, I could not have been chosen as the recipient of
> His super-abundant love and overwhelming grace, had I invoked His
> grace directly instead of being the humble vassal that I am of the one
> that stands last in the chain of His devotees”.

The last sentence of the above monologue obviously reflects the theme already set out by the Āḻvār in VIII-10 and here then is the point of time at which that bears fruit. The Āḻvār’s mind was, however, quick to retort, saying “Well, You were, all the time, keenly awaiting the influx of the Lord’s grace and now that it is forthcoming, You are the blessed recipient thereof, all right. What then is the special feature, you are trying to import into it now?”

And now is the turn of the Āḻvār to make the brilliant exposition, as follows:

No doubt, God Himself is eager to grant salvation to the subjects, unsolicited, as becomes His high office (Godship) and yet, He chooses to see the soul spontaneously fly to Him for embracement. This is like the bridegroom, throbbing with love for his bride, waiting, all the same, till the bride herself did make the first movement and fly to him, the pleasure thus getting enhanced on both sides. This is precisely the meaning of God waiting and the soul moving towards Him. Mysterious indeed is the way of God in the exercise of His grace, and He suffers the creatures’ complacence in believing that they deserved the Lord’s grace by their own acts of merit. Lakṣmaṇa, who was all agog to render service unto Rāma and Sītā in every conceivable manner and followed them into exile, indicated to Rāma, just before the commencement of the exile, the inordinate longing on his (Lakṣmaṇa’s) part to serve the Divine Couple, in a concrete manner.

He addressed Rāma thus:

> “You shall with Your Videhan Spouse  
> Recline upon the mountain’s brows;  
> Be mine the toil, be mine to keep  
> Watch over You both, awake or asleep”.

When the three of them actually reached the forest, Lakṣmaṇa recollected that he was but Rāma’s vassal and had to do his bidding; Lakṣmaṇa, therefore, petitioned to Rāma to grant the necessary permission before he (Lakṣmaṇa) would stir into action. Even then, Rāma tried to keep Himself in the background and said:

> “Let a spot he chosen, pleasant and pure Where waters gleam and trees
> are fair”.

This did not, however, satisfy Lakṣmaṇa, despite his pledge to render every kind of service (ahaṃ sarvam Kariṣyāmi) and he prayed unto Rama, ‘Kriyatāmiti mām vadha’:

> “Select yourself some pleasant spot, Be mine the care to rear the
> cot”.

And now, the Āḻvār tells his mind,

> “How amazing is this indeed! the Lord addresses me in such terms as
> Lakṣmaṇa did unto Rāma and wants me to command Him and take service
> from Him. He wants me to order Him to take me to Heaven and indicate
> the elaborate arrangements to be made by Him *en route*, such as
> setting up banners, buntings and festoons, holding over my head the
> parasol, to the accompaniment of music from pipes and drums, the Lord
> Himself leading the way, with torch in hand, proclaiming that I, His
> Lord, was coming behind, heralded by the holy band of chanters of
> Divya Prabandha and so on”.

How the Lord hesitated to exercise His own will in the matter of taking the Āḻvār to Heaven without a specific directive from him, is succinctly brought out in Iṭu commentary which, for its sheer brilliance, deserves to be reproduced here, *in toto*. Nampiḷḷai puts it that his Master, Nañcīyar directly heard his Guru, Parāśara Bhaṭṭar, elucidate the point at issue, by expatiating on Śloka 42 of Aḷavandār’s ‘Stotra Ratna’ (hymnal gems) (Tathānujānantamudhāra vīkṣaṇaiḥ), as follows:

Senāpathi is the Archangel and premier chamberlain to God. Dressed in his stately robes, he carries the fan (the sign and privilege of royalty) and holds the baton (symbol of authority). Vast indeed is the privilege he enjoys at the hands of the Lord; unbid, he can enter the private chambers where the Lord and His Divine Consorts are in the gay abandon of their love. The Lord would not take offence at His hoary Chamberlain’s sudden entry into His private chambers. On the other hand, He would even feel more delighted in bis company, relegating His sport with the Divine Consorts to a secondary place. Far from being embarrassed by the sudden entry of the Minister, without prior notice or summons, the Divine Consorts just suspend their free disport and are all attention from the throne which they share with the Lord. The Minister, who is by-no-means unaware of the delicate situation, tarries not longer than absolutely needed for the transaction of the State business and puts before the Lord, in as few and select terms as possible, proposals relating to the Cosmic administration, such as the transfers and appointments of Brahmās (the Demi-urges in charge of each Cosmic egg, comprising fourteen worlds) etc. The Lord at once signifies His approval of all such proposals unquestioningly, literally signing the sanctions with sweet looks. He would say, “Sire, as you have proposed, so be it”.

As Bhaṭṭārya was expounding the profound secrets of God’s love unto His trusted lieutenants, as embodied in the śloka in question, he fell into praroxysms of joy, in the company of Kiṭāmpi-Āccāṉ (the bodyguard disciple of Śrī Rāmānujācārya) and others who were present in that assembly. Āccāṉ was Bhaṭṭārya’s co-student and so great indeed was their mutual affection that Iḷaiyāḻvāṉ, a disciple of Āccāṉ queried the Master as to how he happened to love and follow Bhaṭṭārya, much more than Bhaṭṭārya’s own disciples did.

Āccāṉ replied:

> “Son, you don't seem to be aware of what took place, the other day;
> placing a book in Bhaṭṭārya’s hands, Śrī Rāmānuja led him before Lord
> Raṅganātha and there, outside the Holy Bar, made him recite a Śloka;
> looking round, Śrī Rāmānuja called upon all his disciples, assembled
> there, to hold Bhaṭṭārya on a par with himself, and bestow on him love
> and regard in an equal measure.”

\(ii\) “*I shan’t desire birth in this land of darkness and nescience any more*”. Thus does the Āḻvār clarify his present stand to his mind which questioned him whether, in the light of the Lord’s subservient mood, he would go his own way and enjoy the Lord, right here, or yield to His wish and permit Him to lift him up to the heavenly abode. As a matter of fact, the Āḻvār’s mind was quite aware of the earlier attitude of the Āḻvār and his special fascination for the several pilgrim centres in this abode, where the Lord is manifest in His worshippable iconic Form, displaying, at each such centre, a particular aspect and special attribute to be meditated upon. The Āḻvār now impresses upon his mind that, while his love for these centres remains unabated, he nevertheless dreaded this soil, because of its corrupting influence on even that exalted band of Eternal Heroes (Nitya Sūrīs), if ever they came down here. Nay, the Earth’s contamination would extend even to their Chief. Well, did it spare even one of the eminence of Prahlāda? Further, although Nammāḻvār and the other Āḻvārs came into this world, at their own volition, for the redemption and uplift of mankind, as set forth in the Śloka: “Kritātiṣu narā Rājan......... Kalau iccanthi sambhavam” of Śrī Bhāgavada, yet he would not wish to stay in this abode any more, having already rendered the service expected of him, namely, singing these hymns, thereby rendering ‘Kali’ (the evil forces of the current yuga) ineffective.

True, there was a time when the Āḻvār stuck fast to centres like Tiruvāraṉviḷai and would have voted for everlasting stay there in preference to going up to Heaven. But now, he has been completely disillusioned and will no longer like to walk on the double-edged razor that life is, in this material body made up of the five elements and in this land of dark nescience, with its endless potentialities for mischief and incalculable damage to his spiritual progress. If that were so, addressing his mind currently to adore the Lord, enshrined at Tiruvāṭṭāṟu would appear to be rather misleading but it is not so. The Lord has come to this centre only to expedite the Āḻvār’s ascent to Heaven and it, therefore, behoves the Āḻvār to cooperate with the Lord and facilitate His work. Adoration of the Lord, in this particular context, would, therefore, mean that the Āḻvār should fall in line with the Lord, whose presence in Tiruvāṭṭāṟu forms part of His project of lifting the Āḻvār up to the high Heavens.




## 10.6.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வாட்டாற்றான் அடிவணங்கி மாஞாலப் பிறப்புஅறுப்பான்  
கேட்டாயே மடநெஞ்சே! கேசவன் எம் பெருமானைப்  
பாட்டுஆய பலபாடி பழவினைகள் பற்றுஅறுத்து

nāṭṭārōṭu iyalvuoḻintu nāraṇaṉai naṇṇiṉamē.

**English translation of verse 10.6.2:**

Many indeed are the favours on us conferred;  
Better take note, my docile mind, our contacts were severed  
With the world around and gone are our age-long sins,  
To cut our moorings with this land of dark nescience,  
Thro’ many a song we did laud Kēcavaṉ, our Lord,  
The lovely feet of our Sire in Tiruvāṭṭāṟu, we adored  
And Nāraṇaṉ, Our Liege-Lord, we have attained.

**Notes:**

This song is but a continuation of the Āḻvār’s dialogue with his mind, Questioned by the mind as to why the Āḻvār gloated over the grace of the Lord, as if it was something extra-ordinary, instead of looking upon it merely as the Lord’s response, rather belated, to the request made by him, right from the opening song of his very first hymnal, namely, Tiruviruttam, the Āḻvār disabuses it of its wrong notions, Well, the Āḻvār had merely prayed for deliverance from this foul body, purged of all his grossness, while what actually materialised, due to the influx of the Lord’s extraordinary grace, is, as listed in this song, namely, eradication of his age-long sins, lauding the Lord through a spate of songs, comprised in his four hymnals, severance of contacts with the worldlings and attainment of Lord Śrīman Nārāyaṇa. The Āḻvār would want his mind to take due note of all these and acknowledge the immensity of the Lord’s bounty. By exhibiting the enthralling charm of His locks of hair, the Lord attracted the Āḻvār and the latter poured out his heart unto Him through many a scintillating song. Was it not the Lord’s unique grace which made the Āḻvār laud Him, instead of falling in line with his fellow-beings, in this land, rampant with rant and adulation, glorifying the frail humans, with all their dirt and devilry? The sycophants themselves are fully aware of the unworthiness of the men they adore and yet they indulge in such unpardonable white lies, all for the sake of petty gains and eking out their livelihood. And what more? To the list of favours conferred on the Āḻvār has also been added his complete severance from the men around, steeped miserably in the erroneous notions of ‘I-ness’ and ‘My-ness’. And then, the finale comes, namely, the attainment of the Eternal Friend and Relation, the Supreme Lord—Śrīman Nārāyaṇa, to the rigid and total exclusion of those parasites, the artificial, earthly relations.




## 10.6.3
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நண்ணினம் நாராயணனை நாமங்கள் பலசொல்லி  
மண்உலகில் வளம்மிக்க வாட்டாற்றான் வந்துஇன்று  
விண்உலகம் தருவானாய் விரைகின்றான் விதிவகையே  
எண்ணின வாறுகா இக்கருமங்கள் என்நெஞ்சே!

viṇulakam taruvāṉāy viraikiṉṟāṉ vitivakaiyē  
eṇṇiṉa vāṟukā ikkarumaṅkaḷ eṉneñcē!

**English translation of verse 10.6.3:**

Nārāyaṇa, our Benefactor great, we have attained,  
Chanting many a holy name of His, my friendly mind,  
The benign qualities of my Lord beam forth in this land,  
And stationed in Tiruvāṭṭāṟu, He awaits my command  
To grant me the Heaven and that too, with great speed;  
Well, these deeds of His do my expectations far exceed!

**Notes:**

\(i\) The Āḻvār’s joyous rapport with his mind continues. He is amazed at the Lord’s overwhelming grace, far exceeding all his earlier expectations.

\(ii\) As the Āḻvār contemplated on the manifestations of the Lord, in His worshippable Form at the various pilgrim centres, he was particularly impressed by a special auspicious attribute, graciously displayed by the Lord in each centre and this was naturally meditated upon by Him. The illustrious author of ‘Ācārya Hṛdayam’ has indeed high-lighted this aspect. In aphorism 184 of the said work, it has been brought out that the Lord at Tiruvāṭṭāṟu has been presented to us by Nammāḻvār, as one who subserves His devotees, even while conferring on them the heavenly bliss. Oh, what a gift and in what manner served! As Nampiḷḷai puts it, in his soul-stirring diction, it is not as if the Lord just accommodates the Āḻvār, in that Eternal Land peopled by the Celestials, and puts him as one more denizen of the exalted Heaven; the Lord simply gifts away the entire Heaven to the Āḻvār. What is more, He deems it a matter of great condescension, on the part of the Āḻvār, if he accepted the gift. The Lord’s anxiety, in this context, arises from the fact that He is in no mood to just lift the Āḻvār along but He would do so only at the Āḻvār’s own bidding, indicating the manner in which he should be conducted by the Lord and assigning Him quite a few tasks to be performed *en route*.

Well, seeing that the creature is but the Creator’s great gain, the latter’s anxiety to reclaim the former, seeking his willing co-operation is quite understandable. Again, in the work-a-day world, when we seek the good offices of some one for the accomplishment of a particular task, we find that his actual performance falls far short of our expectations and so, we have to do our own bit also. But that is not the case with the Lord whose bounty surpasses even our dreamy expectations.




## 10.6.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

என்நெஞ்சத்து உள்இருந்து இங்கு இரும்தமிழ்நூல்இவைமொழிந்து  
வல்நெஞ்சத்து இரணியனை மார்வு இடந்த வாட்டாற்றான்

**English translation of verse 10.6.4:**

Note, Ye, my sweet mind, the Lord, in Tiruvāṭṭāṟu enshrined,  
Tore into twain Iraṇyaṉ’s heart of steel and, in the war  
Of Mahābhārata, took up arms for Pāṇṭavas’ sake, a terror  
He was unto the kings ranged opposite; firmly fixed in my mind,  
These fine songs were by Him sung and heaps He on me evermore  
Favours fresh, indeed an act of grace galore!

**Notes:**

\(i\) The great Ordainer that the Supreme Lord is, He has been depicted in songs one and three of this decad, as the ordained, carrying out the dictates of the Āḻvār or at least wanting to do so. The present song dispels the doubt, possibly entertained by some persons as to whether the Sovereign Lord would ever descend to such depths and play a subservient role. Did not the Lord keep Himself ready all over the place, as Narasiṅga, so as to respond immediately to the call of His young devotee, Prahlāda? And then, He served the Pāṇṭavas in ever so many ways and did the meanest of jobs, such as running errands, driving Arjuna’s chariot and so on.

\(ii\) The Āḻvār’s mind, steeped, for ages, in sensual pleasures, was taken possession of. by the Lord, at the appropriate moment, and there He established Himself firmly lest He should be denied re-entry into the Āḻvārs mind, once He got out of it. Well, what was all this herculean effort for, on the part of the Lord? Here is the answer: It was from this vantage point that the Lord sang ‘Tiruvāymoḻi’, these songs, *par excellence*, chaste and elegant, syntactically perfect, setting the pace for future grammarians to emulate and enjoy. The authorship of ‘Tiruvāymoḻi’ is thus clearly ascribed to the Lord Himself.

\(iii\) Lord Kṛṣṇa controlled and conducted the military strategy of the great war of Mahābhāratha, at every turn. Once, it so happened that the horses of the Pāṇḍava army were almost dying of thirst and there was no water near at hand. The Lord, who could divine the presence of water even in rocky soil, drew forth plentiful supply of water from the bosom of the earth and retrieved what seemed to be a forlorn situation beyond remedy. Naturally, the Lord’s presence on the battlefield, as a partisan of the Pāṇḍavas, ever ready to surmount difficulties of whatever magnitude, struck terror in the hearts of the kings ranged on the side of the Kauravas, and they sank down, with diffidence.

**English translation of verse 10.6.5:**

I am on my heavenly ascent and the Lord enshrined  
In Tiruvāṭṭaṟu is here to guide me *en route*, as of yore ordained,  
Laugh down, my mind, the world that hitherto kept you bound;  
Implanted on my head are the feet, well adorned  
By the honey-studded tuḻaci flower, of the Lord,  
Who roams about on His lovely mount, the Garuḍa.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The Āḻvār is indeed very jubilant over the immediate prospect of his ascent to Heaven through that exalted and exhilarating route, known as ‘Arcirādi mārga He sees in the Lord at Tiruvāṭṭāṟu, his keen escort, on his Heaven-bound journey. As a matter of fact, the Āḻvār has still not got off the ground and yet, so sanguine is he of his ascent to Heaven that he feels that he is already well on the way.

\(ii\) The Āḻvār points out to his mind that the Lord has placed His good offices at his disposal, during his ensuing journey through the stellar route, true to His assurance of yore, ‘Mokṣayiṣyāmi Māśucaḥ’ (Bhagavad Gītā XVIII.66). The mind wishes to know what precisely the Āḻvār expects of it, at this crucial juncture and the Āḻvār wants it to scornfully laugh at the hellish existence he had hitherto eked out, wallowing in the stye of worldly life, miserably bound down to home and hearth. The original text of this song specifically says that the Āḻvār called upon his mind to laugh at ‘hell’ but it need not be literally taken so, as life over here, entailing the ungodly pursuit, the scramble for food and raiment, is just as bad as hell. It is a disdainful laughter of dissociation from ‘Saṃsāra which had kept the Āḻvār in its unrelenting grip, for ages. Piḷḷai Aḻakiya Maṇavāḷa Perumāḷ Araiyar, who was confined to sick-bed for quite some length of time, received one day the temple honours, the garland worn by Lord Raṅganātha and the head-gear, sent to his residence, signifying the Lord’s benedictive send-off of the ailing devotee to Heaven. Thereupon, the savant recited this song and called upon his mind to laugh down his malady.

But then, it might be asked whether the Āḻvār should not have done all this jeering at ‘Saṃsāra’, his erstwhile comrade of ages, from the yonder side of Heaven, instead of doing it, while he is still in this land. Well, the Āḻvār has not the slightest doubt about his impending ascent to Heaven and actually, he has before him the glorious vision of the Lord sporting the honey-studded tuḻaci garlands, mounted on Garuḍa. The Āḻvār is indeed amazed at that he bears on his head the feet of the Lord, although He is mounted aloft, on Garuḍa’s hefty back.

**English translation of verse 10.6.6:**

The lovely pair of feet of my lotus-eyed Sire,  
I wear on my head, stays He in my heart for ever,  
My Lord, Who unto me His glory did reveal,  
Reclines on serpent-couch amid castles tall,  
In Tiruvāṭṭāṟu; the valorous feet we did attain  
Of the Lord by Whom the monstrous elephant was slain.

**Notes:**

\(i\) Once again, the Āḻvār enumerates the favours heaped on him by the benign Lord. Having set His lovely pair of feet on the Āḻvār’s head, the Lord casts on him glances, cool and sweet, from His lotus eyes. And then, He stands firmly in the Āḻvār’s heart, rivetted, as it were. Questioned by his disciples, as to how the Lord could simultaneously stand on the Āḻvār’s head, cast His sweet glances on him and stay inside his heart, Nampiḷḷai cited the example of Sage Saubhari who assumed fifty different forms to enjoy conjugal bliss with his fifty wives. The Lord should have likewise assumed a number of forms to enjoy the Āḻvār in different ways, all at once.

\(ii\) Describing the Lord at Tiruvāṭṭāṟu, as reclining on the serpent couch, the Āḻvār would appear to picture in his mind the stepping on to the Lord’s lap, right on His serpent couch in the yonder heaven, by the ‘Muktā’ (Released Soul), as the Upaniṣads make out.

\(iii\) The slaying of Kuvalayāpīḍam, the formidable elephant in must set upon Lord Kṛṣṇa by the tyrannical Kaṃsa, by the Lord pulling out its tusks, signifies the riddance by the Lord of all ills and evils, the impediments in the way of the Āḻvār attaining Him.

**English translation of verse 10.6.7:**

The valorous feet I did attain of Kovintaṉ Who has His abode  
In me, the sweet aroma does thus my body exude  
Of the tuḷaci, with fragrance intense, at the lotus feet of the Lord  
In Tiruvāṭṭāṟu, the crest jewel of the South, with Castles tall,  
Surrounded by the Sea whose waves in numbers swell.

**Notes:**

In the preceding song, the Āḻvār said that he had attained the Lord’s valorous feet and now he repeats it authoritatively, adducing the evidence to prove his statement. The Āḻvār’s body smells sweet, exuding the fragrance of tuḻaci and this would be possible only if he came in close contact with the Lord at whose lotus feet there is the tuḻaci, with its profusion of perfume c.f. VIII-9-10, where the Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī’s (Āḻvār transformed figuratively into a female lover) mate conclusively proves to the elders around, the union of the Nāyakī with the Lord, enshrined in Kuṭṭanāṭṭu Tiruppuliyūr, from the fragrance of tuḷaci emanating from her body.




## 10.6.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மெய்ந்நின்று கமழ்துளவ விரைஏறு திருமுடியன்  
கைந்நின்ற சக்கரத்தன் கருதும்இடம் பொருதுபுனல்  
மைந்நின்ற வரைபோலும் திருஉருவ வாட்டாற்றாற்கு  
எந்நன்றி செய்தேனா என்நெஞ்சில் திகழ்வதுவே?

meynniṉṟu kamaḻtuḷava viraiēṟu tirumuṭiyaṉ  
kainniṉṟa cakkarattaṉ karutumiṭam porutupuṉal  
mainniṉṟa varaipōlum tiruuruva vāṭṭāṟṟāṟku  
ennaṉṟi ceytēṉā eṉneñcil tikaḻvatuvē?

**English translation of verse 10.6.8:**

Oh, what is the merit in me, that in my heart beams the Lord  
Who stays in Tiruvāṭṭāṟu, like unto a mountain of emerald,  
Wearing on His crown, tuḷaci, full of fragrance that ever lasts  
On my person, Who the warring discus wields that darts  
At the target the Lord intends and gets back as victor smart?

**Notes:**

\(i\) There was hardly any merit in him as far as the Āḻvār could scan and yet the Lord has chosen to shower on him a plethora of benefits. No wonder then, the Āḻvār is amazed at the overwhelming grace of the Lord, bestowed on him with sweet spontaniety.

\(ii\) The text, in this song, describing the pervasive fragrance of the tuḻaci garland worn by the Lord, lends itself to more than one interpretation. It could mean that the sweet fragrance of the tuḻaci, worn on the Lord’s crown, permeates the entire body of the Āḻvār by virtue of the Lord’s entry into his heart. It could also mean that the aroma of the tuḷaci migrated upwards from the Lord’s body and stuck to His crown.

It is indeed interesting that the Lord’s discus performs its job with push-button precision; when the thought of punishing an adversary just crosses the Lord’s mind, it is as good as pressing the button, signalling to the discus the target in question. The discus darts with lightning speed, hits the target, all right and gets back to the Lord.

\(iii\) Unable to discover any good in him even by extra-liberal standards, not even anything bearing the semblance thereof, the Āḻvār is aghast with wonder at the Lord’s great gesture.




## 10.6.9
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

திகழ்கின்ற திருமார்பில் திருமங்கை தன்னோடும்  
திகழ்கின்ற திருமாலார் சேர்விடம்தண் வாட்டாறு  
புகழ்நின்ற புள்ஊர்தி போர்அரக்கர் குலம்கெடுத்தான்  
இகழ்வுஇன்றி என்நெஞ்சத்து எப்பொழுதும் பிரியானே.

tikaḻkiṉṟa tirumārpil tirumaṅkai taṉṉōṭum  
tikaḻkiṉṟa tirumālār cērviṭamtaṇ vāṭṭāṟu  
pukaḻniṉṟa puḷūrti pōrarakkar kulamkeṭuttāṉ  
ikaḻvuiṉṟi eṉneñcattu eppoḻutum piriyāṉē.

**English translation of verse 10.6.9:**

How is it, Tirumāl on Whose resplendent chest does Tirumaṅkai beam,  
Who dwells in cool Tiruvāṭṭāṟu, Who plies the bird of standing fame,  
As His vehicle, Who the militant Asuras did blast,  
Stays forever in my despicable heart, with no disgust?

**Notes:**

\(i\) Surely, it is the farthest limit up to which the Lord’s love for His devotees could go; the Lord has chosen to stay firmly and, for ever, in the Āḻvār’s despicable heart, without the slightest disgust or uneasiness.

\(ii\) The Lord, Who has got lodged on His winsome chest Lakṣmī, the Goddess of affluence, stays in cool Tiru-vāṭṭāṟu, with Garuḍa, famed as the very embodiment of Vedas, as His favourite mount. And yet, one of such peerless eminence has chosen to stay, firm and fast, in the Āḻvār’s heart, as if He has nowhere else to go, rather, does not like to go anywhere else. What is at the bottom of this massive love of the Lord? Well, this is what is exercising the Āḻvār’s mind at the moment.




## 10.6.10
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

பிரியாதுஆட் செய்என்று பிறப்புஅறுத்து ஆள் அறக்கொண்டான்  
அரியாகி இரணியனை ஆகம்கீண்டான் அன்று  
பெரியார்க்கு ஆட்பட்டக்கால் பெறாதபயன் பெறுமாறு  
வரிவாள் வாய்அரவுஅணைமேல் வாட்டாற்றான் காட்டினனே.

piriyātuāṭ ceyeṉṟu piṟappuaṟuttu āḷ aṟakkoṇṭāṉ  
ariyāki iraṇiyaṉai ākamkīṇṭāṉ aṉṟu  
periyārkku āṭpaṭṭakkāl peṟātapayaṉ peṟumāṟu  
varivāḷ vāyaravuaṇaimēl vāṭṭāṟṟāṉ kāṭṭiṉaṉē.

**English translation of verse 10.6.10:**

Blest am I with unremitting service unto the Lord,  
Cut out from worldly bondage; my Sire who tore to shreds  
Iraṇiyaṉ’s body as Ari of yore and does on serpent-bed  
Now relax at Tiruvāṭṭāṟu, has indeed demonstrated  
That by His sweet grace do accrue unattainable gains  
Unto those that remain as vassals of the great ones.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The Āḻvār’s great gains, far exceeding even the dreamiest of his expectations are: The Lord’s own utterance from His coral lips, inviting the Āḻvār to render unto Him unremitting service in close proximity and actually taking service from him; He has also halted the dreadful cycle of birth and death. Gains of this magnitude cannot be secured by one’s own efforts, however long and strenuous and only the Lord’s spontaneous grace, totally unrelated to one’s merit, can shower such immense benefits which the text of the song, as in the original, terms as the *attainment of unattainable gains*. And now, the Āḻvār even goes to the length of bringing within the purview cf this special category of gains, each one of the Lord’s past incarnations, as Ari [Naraśiṅga (Man-Lion) etc.] as if they were all directed towards salving the Āḻvār and catering to his exclusive enjoyment.

\(ii\) It has been clearly elucidated in the episode of Kṣatrabandhu, occurring in ‘Viṣṇudharma’, how those blest by the ‘Mahātmās’, the great ones, are doled out rich benefits of rare magnitude. These mighty donors are not weighed down by considerations of either the pettiness of their recipients or the greatness of the benefits granted to them. In other words, these great souls do not shrink back and withhold their bounty, looking at the rich, intrinsic value of their gifts vis-a-vis the poor stature of the donees. As a matter of fact, even Prahlāda did not enjoy the proud privilege, conferred by the Lord on the Āḻvār, of singing ‘Tiruvāymoḻi’. Little wonder then, the Āḻvār deems it an unattainable gain attained by him, a rare piece of service, graciously assigned to him by the Lord.




## 10.6.11
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

காட்டித்தன் கனைகழல்கள் கடுநரகம் புகல்ஒழித்த  
வாட்டாற்று எம்பெருமானை வளங்குருகூர்ச் சடகோபன்  
பாட்டாய தமிழ்மாலை ஆயிரத்துள் இப்பத்தும்-  
கேட்டு ஆரார் வானவர்கள் செவிக்குஇனிய செஞ்சொல்லே. (2)

kāṭṭittaṉ kaṉaikaḻalkaḷ kaṭunarakam pukaloḻitta  
vāṭṭāṟṟu emperumāṉai vaḷaṅkurukūrc caṭakōpaṉ  
pāṭṭāya tamiḻmālai āyirattuḷ ippattum-  
kēṭṭu ārār vāṉavarkaḷ cevikkuiṉiya ceñcollē. (2)

**English translation of verse 10.6.11:**

These songs ten, out of the thousand,  
Composed by Caṭakōpaṉ, in chaste Tamil, the hymnal garland,  
Adoring the Lord at Tiruvāṭṭāṟu, Who did graciously reveal  
His lovely pair of feet and rid him of [Saṃsāra] the cruel hell,  
Will unto the ears of the Celestials be a treat insatiable.

**Notes:**

\(i\) This end-song, which usually details the benefits accrued to the chanters of the songs, in this decad, says that these songs will feast the ears of the Celestials, in Heaven sumptuously and that they will never feel satiated. On the face of it, this sounds like a departure from the general pattern of the end-songs of the other decads. But it is not so. What is actually meant to be conveyed by this song is that the chanters of this decad will surely go to Heaven and there again recite these ten songs, much to the delectation of the ‘Nityas’ (Eternal heroes) and ‘Muktas’ (released souls) over there, who would want to hear these songs, over and over again, without satiety.

\(ii\) Unlike Tonṭaraṭippoṭi Āḻvār, who concludes his ‘Tirumālai’, the hymnal garland comprising forty-five songs, referring to them, in all humility, as petty and immature, Nammāḻvār speaks of Tiruvāymoḻi, in such glorious terms as ‘Ceñcol’ (choice diction, sweet and chaste), a grand treat indeed, even to the exalted denizens of the Eternal Land who go into raptures the very moment these songs fall on their ears. The Āḻvār is but the mouth-piece of the Lord, Who sang these songs through His chosen medium. So sweet and scintillating are these songs that they throw the very medium into raptures. In this particular decad, the Lord enshrined in Tiruvāṭṭāṟu is depicted as the Grand Deliverer, ready to take the Āḻvār to Heaven, ridding him of the earthly bondage and all that goes with it. Even the chanters of this decad are assured of heavenly ascent and when they reach Heaven, those on the yonder side curiously enquire as to what is going on on earth. The new-comers would naturally refer to Saint Nammāḻvār and his glorious hymns as of outstanding interest, whereupon the heavenly denizens would insist upon listening to these hymns sung by the former. And now, the ball is set in motion and the recital goes on, over and over again, pressed ever more by the incessant demands of the rapturous audience.
