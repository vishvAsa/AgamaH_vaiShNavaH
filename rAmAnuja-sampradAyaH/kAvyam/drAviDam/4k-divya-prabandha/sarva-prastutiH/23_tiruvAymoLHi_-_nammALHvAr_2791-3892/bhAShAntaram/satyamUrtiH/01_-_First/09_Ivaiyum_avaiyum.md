## 00 Intro1.9
If the Lord’s flow of grace unto the hitherto starved Soul were to be full and flooding, all of a sudden, the Subject cannot stand it and will just get swept off his feet. It is a matter of common knowledge how babes are fed through a graded course, beginning with breast milk, a little gruel some time later, and then, small bits of rice and so on. If, out of misplaced love, a parent fed the young one straightaway on adult scale-rice, curry and all that—the result would be disastrous. As in the case of food, in the matter of imparting education also, one goes step by step. Little wonder then, the omniscient Lord regulates the influx of His grace in such a manner that the recipient is able to stomach it all right.

As is oft repeated in these pages, the Lord’s grace is the sole means for attaining Him and yet, against the above background, the Āḻvār was not straightaway conferred the final bliss right at the beginning when he prayed to the Lord (opening song of Tiruviruttam) for the termination of existence in his foul body. The Āḻvār had to pass through a course of shock treatment, experiencing alternately the bliss of Divine presence and union and the cruel pangs of separation, whetting his appetite and enriching his Divine love and wisdom all the time. Before wearing a heavy ornament in the ear which is pretty delicate, one has to gradually prepare the ground by enlarging the ear-hole by stages, first inserting a small piece of string, then a thin metallic ring or chip and so on. Again, one who has been on a month’s fast, either due to sickness or as a matter of penance, has to restart taking food only by stages, rice ground into a paste being smeared on the body, oral administration of gruel of low consistency, so on and so forth. The Lord, according to the Āḻvār’s own admission in this decad as well as 1V-5-5, unfolds unto the Āḻvār His glorious traits and deeds by stages, consistent with his capacity for in-take. (See aphorism 115 of Ācārya Hṛdayam). It would indeed be too much for the Āḻvār to bear if he were conferred, all at once, bliss enjoyed by the Eternal Angels in the Lord’s close proximity in Heaven. No doubt, the Lord covets the Āḻvār’s body, being the last of the series of bodies donned by him, in which the Lord has now been able to reclaim him. And yet He would not straightaway jump into the crown of his head, much as He would like to. If He did so, it would doubtless bring about the sudden collapse of the Āḻvār, like unto the pauper from birth, who suddenly comes by a sizable treasure, succumbing to the shock. He would first get near the Āḻvār, stand close to him, get into his hip, thence move upwards, to the region of his heart from there, step on to the shoulder, enter his tongue, peep through his eyes, pause for a while on the forehead and then reach the head, His ultimate destination. It is this trait of a well-regulated flow of the Lord’s grace that the Āḻvār admires and brings out in this decad.




## 1.9.1
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

இவையும் அவையும் உவையும் இவரும் அவரும் உவரும்,  
எவையும் எவரும் தன்னுளே ஆகியும் ஆக்கியும் காக்கும்,  
அவையுள் தனிமுதல் எம்மான் கண்ண பிரான் என் அமுதம்,  
சுவையன் திருவின் மணாளன் என்னுடைச் சூழல் உளானே.

ivaiyum avaiyum uvaiyum ivarum avarum uvarum,  
evaiyum evarum taṉṉuḷē ākiyum ākkiyum kākkum,  
avaiyuḷ taṉimutal emmāṉ kaṇṇa pirāṉ eṉ amutam,  
cuvaiyaṉ tiruviṉ maṇāḷaṉ eṉṉuṭaic cūḻal uḷāṉē.

**English translation of verse 1.9.1:**

Around me is my Liege-Loṟd, my ambrosia.  
The great Lover, Tiru’s (Mahālakṣmī’s) Consort, Kaṇṇaṉ,  
The sole cause and Internal Controller, pervading all beings all over,  
(Both Sentient and non-sentient) and sustaining them all within Him.




## 1.9.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

சூழல் பலபல வல்லான் தொல்லை அம் காலத்து உலகைக்  
கேழல் ஒன்று ஆகி இடந்த கேசவன் என்னுடை அம்மான்,  
வேழ மருப்பை ஒசித்தான் விண்ணவர்க்கு எண்ணல் அரியான்  
ஆழ நெடுங் கடல் சேர்ந்தான் அவன் என் அருகவிலானே.

cūḻal palapala vallāṉ tollai am kālattu ulakaik  
kēḻal oṉṟu āki iṭanta kēcavaṉ eṉṉuṭai ammāṉ,  
vēḻa maruppai ocittāṉ viṇṇavarkku eṇṇal ariyāṉ  
āḻa neṭuṅ kaṭal cērntāṉ avaṉ eṉ arukavilāṉē.

**English translation of verse 1.9.2:**

Near me is my Lord of many descents, Who, as a peerless Boar,  
Once retrieved the Earth from the ocean; Killed He a tusker,  
As Kēcavaṉ, smashing its tusks; much beyond the comprehension  
Of Viṇṇavar (Devas), He reclined on the deep and vast ocean.

**Note**

There are two different episodes about the Earth having been picked out of the ocean.

\(a\) Hiraṇyākṣa, the demon with golden eyes, had rolled up the Earth like a mat, tucked under his arm-pit and then hid himself inside the oceanic waters. Lord Viṣṇu, at the request of the Devas, incarnated as a Boar with a gigantic tusk, bent and protruding, chased the demon under the waters and forked the Earth out on the unique tusk.

\(b\) At the end of the last epoch, Known as ‘Pādma Kalpa’ (the current one is Śveta Varāha Kalpa) Lord Śrīman Nārāyaṇa assumed the form of the Primordial Boar with the unique tusk, long and bent, and retrieved the Earth which had gone inside the watery expanse of the deluge.




## 1.9.3
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அருகல் இலாய பெரும் சீர் அமரர்கள் ஆதி முதல்வன்,  
கருகிய நீல நன் மேனி வண்ணன் செந்தாமரைக் கண்ணன்,  
பொரு சிறைப் புள் உவந்து ஏறும் பூமகளார் தனிக் கேள்வன்,  
ஒருகதியின் சுவை தந்திட்டு ஒழிவு இலன் என்னோடு உடனே

arukal ilāya perum cīr amararkaḷ āti mutalvaṉ,  
karukiya nīla naṉ mēṉi vaṇṇaṉ centāmaraik kaṇṇaṉ,  
poru ciṟaip puḷ uvantu ēṟum pūmakaḷār taṉik kēḷvaṉ,  
orukatiyiṉ cuvai tantiṭṭu oḻivu ilaṉ eṉṉōṭu uṭaṉē

**English translation of verse 1.9.3:**

Of auspicious qualities, undiminishing and eternal,  
Of sapphire hue, the Primal Lord of the Celestials,  
Of red-lotus eyes, with the bird (Garuḍa) as His vehicle, of hefty wings  
Pūmakaḷār’s (lotus-born Lakṣmī’s peerless Consort stays)  
Inside me, regaling me in a number of ways.

**Note**

It is a rich and varied fare that the Lord serves to the Āḻvār, having taken possession of him and shifted unto his body which now constitutes the seat of His entire cosmic activities.

The Lord exhibits:

\(a\) His auspicious qualities, eternal and unlimited;  
(b) His Overlordship of the Celestials in Heaven;  
(c) His exquisite form of sapphire hue;  
(d) His bewitching looks emanating from the red-lotus eyes, full of grace;  
(e) Garuḍā, His mighty vehicle, with tough plumes;  
(f) His Lordship of ‘Śrī’, the Divine Mother, the Goddess of affluence.

These correspond to the six rasas (appetisers) which enter our dishes, forming a well-integrated meal.




## 1.9.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

உடன் அமர் காதல் மகளிர் திருமகள் மண்மகள் ஆயர்-  
மட மகள் என்று இவர் மூவர் ஆளும் உலகமும் மூன்றே,  
உடன் அவை ஒக்க விழுங்கி ஆல் இலைச் சேர்ந்தவன் எம்மான்,  
கடல் மலி மாயப் பெருமான் கண்ணன் என் ஒக்கலையானே.

uṭaṉ amar kātal makaḷir tirumakaḷ maṇmakaḷ āyar-  
maṭa makaḷ eṉṟu ivar mūvar āḷum ulakamum mūṉṟē,  
uṭaṉ avai okka viḻuṅki āl ilaic cērntavaṉ emmāṉ,  
kaṭal mali māyap perumāṉ kaṇṇaṉ eṉ okkalaiyāṉē.

**English translation of verse 1.9.4:**

My Lord’s favourite spouses three  
Are Tirumakaḷ, Maṇmakaḷ, Āyarmaṭamakaḷ; the worlds three  
He rules over, He ate them up simultaneously  
And on a fig-leaf, during deluge, lay;  
Of wondrous deeds and glory, bigger than ocean,  
Kaṇṇaṉ, my Liege-Lord is on my hip seated now.

**Notes**

\(i\) The Universal Lord sits on the hip of the Āḻvār even as He sat on the hip of Yaśōda, during His Avatāra, as Śrī Kṛṣṇa.

\(ii\) The three worlds referred to are the Svarga, up above, the Underworld, down below (Pāthāla) and the Earth, in between. The three Spouses of the Lord in His transcendental setting are: Śrī (Tirumakaḷ), Bhū (Maṇmakaḷ) and Nīla (Āyar maṭa makaḷ).




## 1.9.5
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஒக்கலை வைத்து முலைப் பால் உண் என்று தந்திட வாங்கிச்,  
செக்கம் செக அன்று அவள்பால் உயிர் செக உண்ட பெருமான்,  
நக்க பிரானோடு அயனும் இந்திரனும் முதலாக,  
ஒக்கவும் தோற்றிய ஈசன் மாயன் என் நெஞ்சின் உளானே.

okkalai vaittu mulaip pāl uṇ eṉṟu tantiṭa vāṅkic,  
cekkam ceka aṉṟu avaḷpāl uyir ceka uṇṭa perumāṉ,  
nakka pirāṉōṭu ayaṉum intiraṉum mutalāka,  
okkavum tōṟṟiya īcaṉ māyaṉ eṉ neñciṉ uḷāṉē.

**English translation of verse 1.9.5:**

The Supreme Lord Who created one and all—  
Ayaṉ (Brahmā), Nakkapirāṉ (Rudra), Intiraṉ (Indra) and others of wondrous traits  
And deeds-Who, sitting on the hip of that devil,  
(Pūtanā), Sucked her breast and life alike, stays now in my heart




## 1.9.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மாயன் என் நெஞ்சின் உள்ளான் மற்றும் எவர்க்கும் அதுவே,  
காயமும் சீவனும் தானே காலும் எரியும் அவனே,  
சேயன் அணியன் எவர்க்கும் சிந்தைக்கும் கோசரம் அல்லன்,  
தூயன் துயக்கன் மயக்கன் என்னுடைத் தோளிணையானே.

māyaṉ eṉ neñciṉ uḷḷāṉ maṟṟum evarkkum atuvē,  
kāyamum cīvaṉum tāṉē kālum eriyum avaṉē,  
cēyaṉ aṇiyaṉ evarkkum cintaikkum kōcaram allaṉ,  
tūyaṉ tuyakkaṉ mayakkaṉ eṉṉuṭait tōḷiṇaiyāṉē.

**English translation of verse 1.9.6:**

Ha! right in my heart is Māyaṉ (the wonderful Lord),  
As in the case of none else; body and soul, wind and fire,  
He at once is; near (unto some) and yet far (unto others).  
Beyond mental reach of one and all is my impeccable Lord,  
(Unto the unfortunate sceptics), elusive and confounding,  
He is now on my shoulders firmly mounted.

**Notes**

\(i\) The Supreme Lord controls the bodies of the different species of beings and the Souls inside them, the elements and all. Easily accessible to the devout who depend solely on His voluntary grace, He is beyond the comprehension of those who seek to know Him through their own efforts. Of easy grasp by the recipients of His grace, He is elusive unto others, who, by dint of their Kārmik influence, either doubt His very existence or comprehend Him the wrong way, as one on a par with other minor deities, as one without form and attributes, so on and so forth.

\(ii\) Speaking about clarity and copfusion, precision and prevarication, in the above context, it is worth mentioning the following incident by way of illustrating that devotion and conviction go hand in hand and where devotion is wanting, there doubt, ignorance and bewilderment prevail.

\(iii\) Among the many listeners of Śrī Parāśara Bhaṭṭar’s scintillating discourses, there was a learned Pandit whom Bhaṭṭar, however, treated with no more than the barest ordinary courtesy. On the other hand, there was an aged Śrī Vaiṣṇava without any academic learning, whom Bhaṭṭar received with great respect and attention. A third party who felt puzzled over this marked disparity in treatment, and that too, in the reverse order, reverently approached Bhaṭṭar and prayed for clarification. Bhaṭṭar coolly replied, “You may come tomorrow as usual and watch. The parties in question will also come and I will tell you what it is”. The morning came, the Pandit first came and paid obeisance to Bhaṭṭar who, however, received him as usual with ordinary politeness; the third party was also with them by now, when Bhaṭṭar asked the learned Pandit: “Whom have you settled in your mind as the ‘Paratattva’ (ultimate Truth)?” The Pandit went about it, in a ponderous manner, full of doubts and uncertainty, quoting certain texts in favour of the Supremacy of Brahmā (who is but the demi-urge, the appointed agent for creation), some in favour of the overlordship of the All-pervading Viṣṇu and some others, establishing the Sovereign sway of Rudra (the appointed agent for destruction). Ultimately, he wound up by betraying his helplessness that, in the face of these conflicting texts, it would not be possible to arrive at any conclusion. At this stage, the aforesaid elderly person also arrived. Receiving him with great reverence, Bhaṭṭar asked: “Pray, who to you is the Ultimate Truth?” Pat came the reply, with pin-point precision: “I know of none other than Lord Śrīman Nārāyaṇa, whom you discourse about, all these days; I also know of no other truth than what you preach to us daily, namely, Śrī Rāmānuja is my sole Saviour, the Means as well as the End of my salvation”. Turning to the questioner of the previous day (third party) Bhaṭṭar said “I do hope You are now convinced that my attention to the elderly person is not misplaced. Now say, to whom I should bend”. Need it be added that the questioner was fully satisfied?




## 1.9.7
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

தோள் இணை மேலும் நன் மார்பின் மேலும் சுடர் முடி மேலும்,  
தாள் இணை மேலும் புனைந்த தண் அம் துழாய் உடை அம்மான்  
கேள் இணை ஒன்றும் இலாதான் கிளரும் சுடர் ஒளி மூர்த்தி,  
நாள் அணைந்து ஒன்றும் அகலான் என்னுடை நாவின் உளானே.

tōḷ iṇai mēlum naṉ mārpiṉ mēlum cuṭar muṭi mēlum,  
tāḷ iṇai mēlum puṉainta taṇ am tuḻāy uṭai ammāṉ  
kēḷ iṇai oṉṟum ilātāṉ kiḷarum cuṭar oḷi mūrtti,  
nāḷ aṇaintu oṉṟum akalāṉ eṉṉuṭai nāviṉ uḷāṉē.

**English translation of verse 1.9.7:**

With His shoulders, winsome chest, the lustrous crown  
And feet, by tulacī, cool and nice, gaily adorned,  
The peerless Lord of mounting radiance and glowing renown,  
Tightens His hold on me, day by day, and now rests He in my tongue.

**Notes**

\(i\) Even as the wife bedecks and beautifies herself to excite the special fascination of her husband, the Lord bedecks Himself with tulacī, which holds out special fascination for the Āḻvār and mingles with him.

\(ii\) The sequence of decoration indicated in the stanza is appreciated by Śrī Parāśara Bhaṭṭar in his own inimitable way, as follows:

> It is but meet, the great Warrior that the Lord is, He decorates first
> of all His sinewy shoulders bearing His weapons, namely, Conch and
> Discus; next comes the winsome chest, the seat of the Divine Mother,
> needing decoration for Her exhilaration; the crown comes thereafter
> only and the rest goes to the Lord’s feet, always coveted by the
> devotees, where their salvation lies.

\(iii\) *Peerless Lord*: That the Lord is of incomparable excellence is brought out succinctly, later on, in III-1-2, the comparisons with lotus, gold etc., touching only a fringe of the subject. The things with which the Lord is compared actually suffer in comparison and lag far behind Him, rather pale into insignificance.




## 1.9.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நாவினுள் நின்று மலரும் ஞானக் கலைகளுக்கு எல்லாம்,  
ஆவியும் ஆக்கையும் தானே அழிப்போடு அளிப்பவன் தானே,  
பூ இயல் நால் தடம் தோளன் பொரு படை ஆழி சங்கு ஏந்தும்,  
காவி நன் மேனிக் கமலக் கண்ணன் என் கண்ணின் உளானே.

nāviṉuḷ niṉṟu malarum ñāṉak kalaikaḷukku ellām,  
āviyum ākkaiyum tāṉē aḻippōṭu aḷippavaṉ tāṉē,  
pū iyal nāl taṭam tōḷaṉ poru paṭai āḻi caṅku ēntum,  
kāvi naṉ mēṉik kamalak kaṇṇaṉ eṉ kaṇṇiṉ uḷāṉē.

**English translation of verse 1.9.8:**

The arts, one and all, blossoming from the tongue,  
Their body (sound) and soul (meaning),  
Their exit and entrance are by Him Controlled.  
Conch and Discus, His lovely shoulders four do sport.  
The lotus-eyed of bewitching charm has my eyes entered.

**Notes**

\(i\) Certain branches of knowledge become extinct due to lack of propagation, due again to lack of interest or adequate intelligence to grasp them and various other causes; the Lord allows them to die out and gets them resuscitated, as and when He deems it necessary.

\(ii\) Cf. IV-2 and 3 of Bhagavad Gītā where Lord Kṛṣṇa says that the Karma Yoga, explained by Him long back to Vivaswat, by him to Manu, and by Manu to Ikṣvāku, was lost through long lapse of time and the same Yoga was again being taught by the Lord to Arjuna (at the appropriate time).




## 1.9.9
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கமலக் கண்ணன் என் கண்ணின் உள்ளான் காண்பன் அவன் கண்களாலே,  
அமலங்கள் ஆக விழிக்கும் ஐம்புலனும் அவன் மூர்த்தி,  
கமலத்து அயன் நம்பி தன்னைக் கண்ணுதலானொடும் தோற்றி  
அமலத் தெய்வத்தொடு உலகம் ஆக்கி என் நெற்றி உளானே.

kamalak kaṇṇaṉ eṉ kaṇṇiṉ uḷḷāṉ kāṇpaṉ avaṉ kaṇkaḷālē,  
amalaṅkaḷ āka viḻikkum aimpulaṉum avaṉ mūrtti,  
kamalattu ayaṉ nampi taṉṉaik kaṇṇutalāṉoṭum tōṟṟi  
amalat teyvattoṭu ulakam ākki eṉ neṟṟi uḷāṉē.

**English translation of verse 1.9.9:**

The lotus-eyed Lord, right in my eyes,  
Could by me be seen through His eyes,  
Which destroyed my nescience and made.  
All my senses five subserve Him; He made  
The lotus-based Ayaṉ (Brahmā), Rudra, on whose forehead  
Is an extra eye, other Devas and rest of the worlds,  
(He of such eminence) is now right on my forehead.

**Note**

The Lord, hitherto not visible, could now be seen in all His grandeur and enjoyed by the Āḻvār, not only through his eyes but all his other senses as well. This was possible only due to the Lord’s redemptive grace, shed in super-abundance through His benevolent looks. Finding that the Āḻvār could assimilate this grand experience, the Lord next passed on to the Āḻvār’s forehead on the penultimate lap of His Journey to the Āḻvār’s crown.




## 1.9.10
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நெற்றியுள் நின்று என்னை ஆளும் நிரை மலர்ப் பாதங்கள் சூடிக்,  
கற்றைத் துழாய் முடிக் கோலக் கண்ண பிரானைத் தொழுவார்,  
ஒற்றைப் பிறை அணிந்தானும் நான்முகனும் இந்திரனும்,  
மற்றை அமரரும் எல்லாம் வந்து எனது உச்சியுளானே.

neṟṟiyuḷ niṉṟu eṉṉai āḷum nirai malarp pātaṅkaḷ cūṭik,  
kaṟṟait tuḻāy muṭik kōlak kaṇṇa pirāṉait toḻuvār,  
oṟṟaip piṟai aṇintāṉum nāṉmukaṉum intiraṉum,  
maṟṟai amararum ellām vantu eṉatu ucciyuḷāṉē.

**English translation of verse 1.9.10:**

The lotus feet of the Lord, wearing round bands of tuḷacī dense,  
Resting on my forehead, are worshipped and worn on their heads,  
By the wearer of crescent Moon (Śiva), Nānmukaṉ (Brahmā), Intiraṉ (Indra)  
And all other Amarar (Devas); Such an eminent One  
Shot up from my forehead, right into my head.

**Notes**

\(i\) Even the exalted Śiva, Brahmā, Indra and other Devas have to queue up, seeking the appropriate time for the propitiation of the Lord. But He, in turn, has got into the Āḻvār’s head, seeking the most appropriate time for it.

\(ii\) In the first line of this stanza (original text) reference has been made to the Lord‘s pair of lotus feet, planted on the Āḻvār’s forehead, and these feet were worshipped by Śiva, Brahmā, Indra and other Devas and borne on their heads. This points to the insignia or the caste-mark worn by Śrī Vaiṣṇavites and from the wording of the stanza, it could be assumed that the Āḻvār bore, on his forehead, the Lord’s pair of feet with a lotus base and not a single foot alone, as a section of Śrī Vaiṣṇavites has chosen to depict.




## 1.9.11
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

உச்சியுள்ளே நிற்கும் தேவதேவற்குக் கண்ண பிரானுக்கு,  
இச்சையுள் செல்ல உணர்த்தி வண் குருகூர்ச் சடகோபன்,  
இச் சொன்ன ஆயிரத்துள்ளே இவையும் ஓர் பத்து எம்பிராற்கு,  
நிச்சலும் விண்ணப்பம் செய்ய நீள் கழல் சென்னி பொருமே.

ucciyuḷḷē niṟkum tēvatēvaṟkuk kaṇṇa pirāṉukku,  
iccaiyuḷ cella uṇartti vaṇ kurukūrc caṭakōpaṉ,  
ic coṉṉa āyirattuḷḷē ivaiyum ōr pattu empirāṟku,  
niccalum viṇṇappam ceyya nīḷ kaḻal ceṉṉi porumē.

**English translation of verse 1.9.11:**

The Lord’s longish feet will for ever crown  
The heads of those who (but once) recite these songs ten,  
Out of the thousand sung by Caṭakōpaṉ of Kurukūr, narrating  
Just as he experienced, how Kaṇṇapirāṉ, the Supreme Lord,  
migrated from one limb of his to another and alighted on his crown.

**Note**

The Supreme Lord, adorning the heads of the exalted Devas, coveted the Āḻvār’s head so much that He got into it by stages, and there being no higher place to step into, the Lord stays on there. In other words, the Āḻvār’s head is the new abode of the Lord. This is indeed the limit for the Lord’s loving condescension (Sauśīlya)! Here then is the mystic realisation that God loves His Subjects in the same way they pine for union with Him.
