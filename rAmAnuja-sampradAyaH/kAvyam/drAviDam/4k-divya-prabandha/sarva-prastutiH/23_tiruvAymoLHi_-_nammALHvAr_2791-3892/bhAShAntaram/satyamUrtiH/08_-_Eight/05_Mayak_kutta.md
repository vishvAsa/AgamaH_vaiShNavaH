## 00 Intro9.5
In the third decad of this centum, the Āḻvār grew apprehensive of the safety of the Lord of exquisite charm, moving along in this wicked land alone and unattended. The Āḻvār could, however, regain his composure, shaking off the fear in question, on the assurance given by the Lord, vide VIII-3-10. The following decad revealed an Āḻvār, fully relieved of his erstwhile fears, but the intense mental enjoyment of the Lord’s regal Form, enchanting every inch, resorted to by the Āḻvār in VIII-4-7, once again resulted in a deep yearning, an insatiable longing for external perception of the Lord’s Form, as envisioned by him and getting locked in His sweet embrace. Non-fulfilment of his longing has consigned the Āḻvār to the bottom-most depths of dejection, the like of which has not been witnessed in the earlier decade. He cries out, like unto one bodily trapped in a forest fire and his limbs appear to be even more worn out than their owner. The Saint beckons the Lord to appear before him in all His regal splendour, wearing His crown, tall and majestic and moving along, like the exhilarating rain-cloud, the rising Sun, so on and so forth. The Lord did not, however, respond and so, this decad ends on a despondent note, the Āḻvār being led to believe that he would just pass away, immured in grief.




## 8.5.1
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மாயக்கூத்தா!வாமனா! வினையேன்கண்ணா! கண்கைகால்  
தூயசெய்ய மலர்களா சோதிச்செவ்வாய் முகிழதா  
சாயல்சாமத் திருமேனி தண்பாசடையா தாமரைநீள்  
வாசத்தடம்போல் வருவானே! ஒருநாள் காண வாராயே.

māyakkūttā!vāmaṉā! viṉaiyēṉkaṇṇā! kaṇkaikāl  
tūyaceyya malarkaḷā cōticcevvāy mukiḻatā  
cāyalcāmat tirumēṉi taṇpācaṭaiyā tāmarainīḷ  
vācattaṭampōl varuvāṉē! orunāḷ kāṇa vārāyē.

**English translation of verse 8.5.1:**

Wondrous Lord, Oh, Vāmaṉā, oh, Kaṇṇā beyond this sinner’s reach!  
With eyes, hands and feet like red lotus in fresh bloom,  
Lips, red and radiant, cool, green, leaf-like complexion, You seem,  
As You walk along, a huge lotus pond in motion, full of fragrance!  
May it please You to appear before me, for a day at least.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The Āḻvār’s request to the Lord is that He should appear before him like a lotus pond, the mere sight of which quenches one’s deep thirst. The Lord’s eyes, hands and feet look like red lotus flowers in bloom. His coral lips with bewitching smiles resemble the lovely lily and His emerald form looks like the green pond with lotus leaves. This completes the picture of the lotus pond, envisaged by the Āḻvār. c.f. ‘Karacaraṇa Saroje......... *Haṛsarasi*’—(Mukunda Mālā)

\(ii\) What precisely egged the Āḻvār on to such a longing has also been indicated in this song. As he was comtemplating the Lord’s incarnation as the bewitching Vāmaṉa, at Indra’s behest, the Āḻvār longed that He should also present such an exquisite Form to him. If the Lord’s incarnation as Vāmaṉa was for the sake of Indra, His incarnation as Kṛṣṇa was only to torment the Āḻvār, by going back to the Celestium, just six weeks before his coming into this abode, like unto a dainty dish hitting against the teeth and falling to the ground without getting inside the mouth to be chewed with great relish. That is why the Āḻvār calls Kṛṣṇa, as the one beyond his (sinner’s) reach.




## 8.5.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

'காணவாராய்' என்றுஎன்று கண்ணும்வாயும் துவர்ந்து அடியேன்  
நாணி நல்நாட்டு அலமந்தால் இரங்கி ஒருநாள் நீஅந்தோ  
காணவாராய்! கருநாயிறுஉதிக்கும் கருமாமாணிக்க  
நாள்நல்மலைபோல் சுடர்ச்சோதி முடிசேர் சென்னி அம்மானே!

'kāṇavārāy' eṉṟueṉṟu kaṇṇumvāyum tuvarntu aṭiyēṉ  
nāṇi nalnāṭṭu alamantāl iraṅki orunāḷ nīantō  
kāṇavārāy! karunāyiṟuutikkum karumāmāṇikka  
nāḷnalmalaipōl cuṭarccōti muṭicēr ceṉṉi ammāṉē!

**English translation of verse 8.5.2:**

Many a time did I call you out, with dried up eyes  
And lips parched up, that You do before me appear  
Like unto a dark, rising Sun, shedding the lustre rare,  
Like the saphire grand, sporting Your radiant crown, neatly poised  
On locks beaming like a lovely mountain, just sprung up;  
Alas! for me to behold but once, You don’t turn up,  
Stricken with shame, fatigued do I on this good Earth languish.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The eyes have become dry and worn out, looking for the Lord in all directions, hoping that He might come from any direction; the lips have become parched up, by calling Him out frequently. The Āḻvār’s stinging shame is due to the Lord not turning up, even though he had not called him for trivial personal gains but merely for the pleasure of beholding Him. This might make the worldlings look at him askance, in a derisive spirit, that it is such an unresponsive Lord, he is madly after. The expression ‘Good Earth’ could either be in the ironical sense, indicating its notriety indirectly, or might mean, as Piḷḷān would put it, that the Earth is really a good place for all but the Āḻvār, inasmuch as all others presumably enjoy the Lord, quietly as could be iṉferred from their not calling Him out, as the Āḻvār does. It seems the Āḻvār is the solitary soul, left without such enjoyment and, therefore, crying out, as he has been doing.

\(ii\) The Sun, rising over the emerald mount, appears to be dark and the Lord’s person is like an emerald mountain and hence, the imagery.




## 8.5.3
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

'முடிசேர் சென்னி அம்மா! நின்மொய்பூம்தாமத் தண்துழாய்க்  
கடிசேர் கண்ணிப் பெருமானே!' என்றுஎன்று ஏங்கி அழுதக்கால்  
படிசேர்மகரக் குழைகளும் பவளவாயும் நால்தோளும்  
துடிசேர் இடையும் அமைந்தது ஓர் தூநீர் முகில்போல் தோன்றாயே.

'muṭicēr ceṉṉi ammā! niṉmoypūmtāmat taṇtuḻāyk  
kaṭicēr kaṇṇip perumāṉē!' eṉṟueṉṟu ēṅki aḻutakkāl  
paṭicērmakarak kuḻaikaḷum pavaḷavāyum nāltōḷum  
tuṭicēr iṭaiyum amaintatu ōr tūnīr mukilpōl tōṉṟāyē.

**English translation of verse 8.5.3:**

Time and again, did I in deep anguish call You out,  
Oh, Sire, donning on Your lovely locks the majestic crown,  
Oh, Lord, wearing the tulaci garland, pretty and fragrant;  
But You wouldn’t before me appear and exhibit Your pearl pendants,  
Which Your Form exquisite befit, coral lips, shoulders four,  
Thin waist and Your complexion like rain-cloud bearing water clear.

**Notes:**

The Āḻvār has been crying himself hoarse, pining for the external perception of the Lord’s enchanting Form and enjoying it in all it details. When, due to constant clamouring, his voice gets choked, it should indeed compel the Lord to come down at once and see what has gone wrong with the yearning devotee. And yet, He has not turned up, making the Āḻvār suspect whether He is beyond his ear-shot.




## 8.5.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

தூநீர் முகில்போல் தோன்றும் நின்சுடர்கொள் வடிவும் கனிவாயும்  
தேநீர்க்கமலக் கண்களும் வந்து என்சிந்தை நிறைந்தவா  
மாநீர்வெள்ளிமலை தன்மேல் வண்கார் நீல முகில்போல  
தூநீர்க்கடலுள் துயில்வானே! எந்தாய்! சொல்லமாட்டேனே.

tūnīr mukilpōl tōṉṟum niṉcuṭarkoḷ vaṭivum kaṉivāyum  
tēnīrkkamalak kaṇkaḷum vantu eṉcintai niṟaintavā  
mānīrveḷḷimalai taṉmēl vaṇkār nīla mukilpōla  
tūnīrkkaṭaluḷ tuyilvāṉē! entāy! collamāṭṭēṉē.

**English translation of verse 8.5.4:**

My Sire, reposing in the Milk-ocean on serpent-bed,  
Like unto the dark rain-cloud on the crest of silvery mount.  
Embedded in deep waters! describe I can’t  
How my thoughts are filled with Your Form radiant.  
Like the rain-cloud bearing water clear, lips red  
And eyes lovely, akin to lotus which sweet water holds.

**Notes:**

\(i\) This song and the next, striking a jubilant note, the exact opposite of what is revealed by the other songs in this decad, are indeed ironically couched. The Āḻvār really feels vexed that the Lord’s sweet and enchanting Form torments his thoughts, in the absence of the external enjoyment, longed for, by him.

\(ii\) Here is indeed a grand poetic imagery. The cloud-hued Lord resting on Ādi-Śeṣa, the white serpent, in the Milk-ocean, is likened to the transparent water-laden cloud on the crest of a white mountain embedded in the deep oceanic waters. Not only this enchanting Form but the lovely eyes and the fruit-like lips appear before the Āḻvār and each one of these tempts the Āḻvār to enjoy them separately and thus torments him.




## 8.5.5
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

சொல்லமாட்டேன் அடியேன் உன்துளங்குசோதித் திருப்பாதம்  
எல்லைஇல் சீர்இள நாயிறு இரண்டுபோல் என்உள்ளவா!  
அல்லல் என்னும் இருள்சேர்தற்கு உபாயம் என்னே? ஆழிசூழ்  
மல்லை ஞாலம் முழுதுஉண்ட மாநீர்க் கொண்டல் வண்ணனே!

collamāṭṭēṉ aṭiyēṉ uṉtuḷaṅkucōtit tiruppātam  
ellaiil cīriḷa nāyiṟu iraṇṭupōl eṉuḷḷavā!  
allal eṉṉum iruḷcērtaṟku upāyam eṉṉē? āḻicūḻ  
mallai ñālam muḻutuuṇṭa mānīrk koṇṭal vaṇṇaṉē!

**English translation of verse 8.5.5:**

Oh, Lord, You are like unto a water-laden cloud,  
The worlds, by oceans surrounded, You did in Your stomach hold,  
The radiance within me, shed by Your dazzling feet superfine,  
Like unto a pair of rising Suns, I just can’t define,  
Say then, how I can the affliction dark, of forgetfulness, attain.

**Notes:**

*Āḻvār to the Lord*:

“My Lord, Your enchanting Form is tormenting my mind without respite; I can survive only if I forget all about this. I can, however, never forget this and I, therefore, pray unto You, my great benefactor, to suggest ways and means of forgetting You altogether”.

*Lord*: “Āḻvār, You haven’t gained my physical presence as yet. It should, therefore, be possible for you to forget me easily”.

*Āḻvār*: “Oh, Sire, have I not told You already (in I-10-10) that I can never more forget You, firmly lodged in my heart? Having cut out my nescience, *in toto*, through Your redemptive grace, Your dazzling feet are in my mind firmly implanted. It is up to You now to solve this riddle and find out some means by which I can forget You and be spared all this misery”.

So then, here is a peculiar problem for the frustrated Āḻvār who can’t have the external enjoyment, intensely longed for by him and is yet continually tormented by the radiance of the Lord’s dazzling feet, shining in his head. The Āḻvār prays unto the Lord to put out this light and induce darkness that can make him forget Him altogether. In Nampiḷḷai’s Īṭu commentary, two interpretations have been set out:

According to Parāśara Bhaṭṭar, the Āḻvār prays unto the Lord:

> “If You are intent upon tormenting me by withholding from me Your
> physical presence, better induce in me the dark nescience, rather
> suggest how I can acquire it”.

Ācārya Ammaṅki Ammāl would say: “With Your dazzling feet illumining my mind all the time, there is no room whatever for nescience, the distressing darkness; if such darkness could, however, be induced in me, I can safely align myself with the worldlings and run after food and raiment like them, forgetting You altogether.”




## 8.5.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

'கொண்டல் வண்ணா! குடக்கூத்தா! வினையேன் கண்ணா! கண்ணா என்  
அண்டவாணா!' என்றுஎன்னை ஆளக் கூப்பிட்டுஅழைத்தக்கால்  
விண்தன்மேல்தான் மண்மேல்தான் விரிநீர்க் கடல்தான் மற்றுத்தான்  
தொண்டனேன் உன்கழல்காண ஒருநாள்வந்து தோன்றாயே.

'koṇṭal vaṇṇā! kuṭakkūttā! viṉaiyēṉ kaṇṇā! kaṇṇā eṉ  
aṇṭavāṇā!' eṉṟueṉṉai āḷak kūppiṭṭuaḻaittakkāl  
viṇtaṉmēltāṉ maṇmēltāṉ virinīrk kaṭaltāṉ maṟṟuttāṉ  
toṇṭaṉēṉ uṉkaḻalkāṇa orunāḷvantu tōṉṟāyē.

**English translation of verse 8.5.6:**

Oh, cloud-hued Lord, Oh, Pot-dancer, when this sinner calls You out,  
Oh, Kaṇṇā, Oh, Kaṇṇā, Oh, heavenly Lord, so that You may enlist  
Me, in your service, even for a day You appear not  
Before this vassal either from Heaven, Earth or oceanic waters vast  
Or from wherever You might be, omnipresent that You are.  
For me to behold your lovely feet.

**Notes:**

Where there is a will, there is a way. The Āḻvār feels poignantly why the Lord, who could, if He so wills, come from anywhere, does not present Himself before him. He could manifest Himself right from the space above, come down from Heaven in all that transcendent splendour, from the Earth where He had already incarnated as Rāma and Kṛṣṇa or from the vast ocean, the Vyūha, the seat of all His creative activities, or from any of the Pilgrim centres, in His Iconic manifestation or from anywhere else, being all-pervasive, in every post and pillar. The Lord’s feet constitute the Āḻvār’s source of subsistence and it is only to behold them and render service at those very feet that the Āḻvār is inviting the Lord to appear before him, at least one day.




## 8.5.7
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வந்து தோன்றாய்அன்றேல் உன் வையம்தாய மலர்அடிக்கீழ்  
முந்தி வந்து யான்நிற்ப முகப்பே கூவிப் பணிக்கொள்ளாய்  
செந்தண்கமலக் கண்கைகால் சிவந்தவாய்ஓர் கருநாயிறு  
அந்தம் இல்லாக் கதிர்பரப்பி அலர்ந்ததுஒக்கும் அம்மானே!

vantu tōṉṟāyaṉṟēl uṉ vaiyamtāya malaraṭikkīḻ  
munti vantu yāṉniṟpa mukappē kūvip paṇikkoḷḷāy  
centaṇkamalak kaṇkaikāl civantavāyōr karunāyiṟu  
antam illāk katirparappi alarntatuokkum ammāṉē!

**English translation of verse 8.5.7:**

Oh, radiant Lord, like unto the endless rays of a black Sun,  
With eyes like lotus, cool and red, hands, feet and lips, all red,  
Even if You appear not before me, pray, lift me on  
To Your lotus feet, which did span all the worlds  
And from this vassal service do command.

**Notes:**

The Āḻvār is granting the Lord the option either to come down here so that he may behold Him or if, in the light of His grandeur and the pettiness of the supplicant, He doesn’t deign to come, He would do well to take him over to that end (Heaven). There, the Āḻvār would not only behold the Lord and have his heart’s fill but he would also want the Lord to take service from him, so that he could render unstinting service at the Lord’s feet which spanned the worlds and, in the process, stepped on the heads of one and all, without distinction of high and low, Vaśiṣṭa or caṇḍāla. The Lord’s enchanting beauty has made the Āḻvār pine for Him and like the fish out of water, he can’t bear being apart from Him any longer and hence, this kind of insistence on his part.




## 8.5.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஒக்கும் அம்மான் உருவம்என்று உள்ளம் குழைந்து நாள்நாளும்  
தொக்க மேகப் பல்குழாங்கள் காணும்தோறும் தொலைவன்நான்  
தக்க ஐவர் தமக்காய்அன்று ஈர்ஐம்பதின்மர் தாள்சாயப்  
புக்கநல்தேர்த் தனிப்பாகா! வாராய் இதுவோ பொருத்தமே?

okkum ammāṉ uruvameṉṟu uḷḷam kuḻaintu nāḷnāḷum  
tokka mēkap palkuḻāṅkaḷ kāṇumtōṟum tolaivaṉnāṉ  
takka aivar tamakkāyaṉṟu īraimpatiṉmar tāḷcāyap  
pukkanaltērt taṉippākā! vārāy ituvō poruttamē?

**English translation of verse 8.5.8:**

Every time I see the gathering clouds, I am by Your memory stung,  
My Lord, Your fame as the devotee’s henchman is far flung,  
As [Arujuna’s] charioteer unique, You led to victory the worthy five,  
Their hundred cousins crumbling down yet down you don’t dive  
And regale me [in that very Form],  
Is this how You do unto Your fame conform?

**Notes:**

Here is the Āḻvār who sees in the rain-clouds, gathered up above, the Lord’s likeness and is haunted by His memory, unlike the worldlings who would think of such clouds only in terms of the rainfall and the bumper crop. Even the Pāṇḍavas, on whose behalf the Lord underwent immense hardships and did even the menial service of driving Arjuna’s chariot, were not of the grand calibre of the Āḻvār. And yet, the Lord known for His readiness to serve His devotees, does not deign to appear before the Āḻvār and satisfy his craving to behold Him and feast his eyes on His insatiable beauty. The Āḻvār’s poser, as in this song, would seem to raise grave doubts about the veracity of the great epic of Mahā Bhārata, the wondrous deeds performed by the Lord and His breath-taking activities on behalf of His devotees, establishing His fame as a partisan of His devotees. Could it be mere propaganda, carried on, through His hirelings, the sages?




## 8.5.9
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

'இதுவோ பொருத்தம்? மின்ஆழிப் படையாய்! ஏறும் இரும்சிறைப்புள்  
அதுவே கொடியா உயர்த்தானே!' என்றுஎன்று ஏங்கி அழுதக்கால்  
எதுவேயாகக் கருதுங்கொல் இம்மாஞாலம் பொறைதீர்ப்பான்  
மதுவார் சோலை உத்தர மதுரைப் பிறந்த மாயனே?

'ituvō poruttam? miṉāḻip paṭaiyāy! ēṟum irumciṟaippuḷ  
atuvē koṭiyā uyarttāṉē!' eṉṟueṉṟu ēṅki aḻutakkāl  
etuvēyākak karutuṅkol immāñālam poṟaitīrppāṉ  
matuvār cōlai uttara maturaip piṟanta māyaṉē?

**English translation of verse 8.5.9:**

Oh, wielder of the effulgent discus, that mighty weapon!  
On Your banner is that bird, Your carrier with large plumes.  
How indeed your callousness can unto Your fame conform,  
Often do 1 ask myself and keep sobbing; what is at all the intention,  
I can hardly guess, of the wondrous Lord, Who was born  
In Uttaramaturai (Mathurā), abounding in orchards fine.

**Notes:**

The Āḻvār is now revolving within his mind, what the Lord of wondrous deeds and auspicious traits, who, during His incarnation as Kṛṣṇa, took birth at Mathurā (in Uttara Pradesh) might be intending to do with him. Let alone what He did for the Pāṇḍavas, as against the Kauravas, how indeed does He mingle with Garuḍa, who (as Āḷavantār puts it, in Śloka 41 of his Stotra Ratna) is said to fulfil several rolas, as servant, friend, vehicle (carrier), seat, banner, canopy and fan! Does the Lord really take all this service from Garuḍa or does He keep him also at a distance, as is the case with the Āḻvār? If the Lord so wills, He could come down to the Āḻvār, mounted on Garuḍa. Perhaps, even Garuḍa is not pressed into service, by the Lord, these days! And then, the discus could have jolly well been commissioned by the Lord, to cut out all those impediments, which operate as a bar to the Āḻvār’s union with Him and yet, if He has not done so, that only means. His relationship with the discus is no better than that which subsists between Him and the Āḻvār.

The Āḻvār is now left a-guessing what precisely the Lord’s intentions might be, with regard to him.




## 8.5.10
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

பிறந்தமாயா! பாரதம்பொருதமாயா! நீஇன்னே  
சிறந்தகால் தீநீர்வான் மண்பிறவும்ஆய பெருமானே  
கறந்த பாலுள் நெய்யேபோல் இவற்றுள்எங்கும் கண்டுகொள்  
இறந்து நின்ற பெருமாயா! உன்னை எங்கே காண்கேனே?

piṟantamāyā! pāratamporutamāyā! nīiṉṉē  
ciṟantakāl tīnīrvāṉ maṇpiṟavumāya perumāṉē  
kaṟanta pāluḷ neyyēpōl ivaṟṟuḷeṅkum kaṇṭukoḷ  
iṟantu niṉṟa perumāyā! uṉṉai eṅkē kāṇkēṉē?

**English translation of verse 8.5.10:**

Wondrous indeed are Your incarnations, oh, Lord,  
Many a wonder You did, during the battle of Bhārata, perform,  
The famous elements five and all things from them derived  
Are unto You, the bodies many; like ghee, latent in milk fresh drawn.  
You do in all things mysteriously abide; where can I find you indeed?

**Notes:**

\(i\) No doubt, the Lord exhibited His amazing simplicity during the Incarnations, betokening His loving condescension. But the Āḻvār, born at a later time, missed them all. Again, the Lord is said to abide in all beings and things and yet, He cannot be see with the naked eye. Where then could the Lord be seen is the question put by the Āḻvār in this song. He is really worried whether he would just pass away without realising his desire to come face to face with the Lord.

\(ii\) The Lord’s incarnation itself is a matter of great wonder, the birthless Being born, of course, at His sweet will and then His mingling with the rest, with no reservation. The wonders performed by Him, during His incarnation as Kṛṣṇa, were many indeed and, in particular, those bearing on the course and conduct of the great battle of Mahā Bhārata were: Taking up arms, at one stage, contrary to His earlier pledge not to wield any weapon, conversion of day into night, spotting out the vital centres of life, the vulnerable spot in the enemy attacking which would prove fatal, so on and so forth.

\(iii\) How could it be asserted that the Invisible Lord resides in all creatures and things? The Upaniṣad provides the answer: “ghrutamiva payasi nigūḍaṃ”. The milk is churned into butter, which again is melted into ghee. But none can, on the face of it, perceive the presence of ghee in milk. And so does the Lord abide unseen in all that exists.




## 8.5.11
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

'எங்கேகாண்கேன் ஈன்துழாய் அம்மான்தன்னை யான்?' என்றுஎன்று

**English translation of verse 8.5.11:**

Those that are conversant with these songs ten,  
Out of the thousand elegant songs of Kurukūr Caṭakōpaṉ,  
Who did pine for the Lord, wearing tulaci garland superfine,  
And with melting tenderness cry out where indeed he could behold Him,  
Will, right here and now, enjoy with no intermission bliss supreme.

**Notes:**

The end-song avers that those that learn this decad will Me steeped in God-enjoyment, day and night, right in this word and, in this very birth, without undergoing the hardships and the vicissitudes which the Āḻvār had to pass through. The Lord will, on His part, make amends for His remissness in not responding to the Āḻvār’s invitation, as in the opening song of this decad, to come and take service from him, by duly requiting the chanters of this decad. Unto these persons, He will rush up and shower on them divine bliss without intermission.
