## 00 Intro9.8
In the fifth decad of this centum (Māyak kūttā), the Āḻvār’s yearning was too deep for words. The Lord responded with even greater avidity and the two of them got wrapt up in mutual delight. The Āḻvār gave vent to his jubilation in the last decad, and even so, in the eighth song of that decad, he referred to himself as a frail being, with whom the great Lord of unlimited prowess has chosen to mingle freely and stay on. The Āḻvār’s frightful sense of his own pettiness, in contra-distinction to the Lord’s grandeur of limitless dimensions, which was rearing up its head now and then, was studiously kept under effective check by the Lord who was apprehensive of the Āḻvār’s tendency to shrink back from Him on this score. The Lord, who noticed, with great concern, a revival of this trend in the Āḻvār, wished to cut it out, there and then, root and branch. The Lord wanted to quell the Āḻvār’s notion of the soul’s pettiness by revealing to him its real grandeur. But then, the soul, like unto a mere glow-worm, may not hold out any appeal to the Āḻvār, profoundly struck by the Lord’s exquisite charm. The other alternative for the Lord was to exhibit the grandeur of the Āḻvār‘s soul along with that of His own. The Lord accordingly revealed to the Āḻvār, His charm first and then the grandeur of the Āḻvār’s soul, in its relation of liegeship to the Sovereign Lord, as delectable unto Him as His ornaments. And so, in this decad, the Āḻvār dwells on the intrinsic beauty of the soul, as the exclusive vassal of the Lord, as revealed by the Lord Himself.

**English translation of verse 8.8.1:**

The cloud-hued Lord of grandeur unique, with eyes, red and wide,  
Reddened lips, teeth sparkling white, imposing pearl pendants,  
Beaming crown, shoulders four, curvate bow, lovely conch, the sword,  
The mace and discus majestic, stands, inside this vassal, resplendent.

**Notes:**

\(i\) In this song, the Āḻvār goes into raptures on beholding the Lord’s exquisite Form displaying the rare charm acquired by Him on His union with the Āḻvār. In VIII-5-2, the Āḻvār was with eyes fully dried and lips parched up, when he beseeched the Lord to oblige him with His sweet presence. The Lord too had undergone such modifications then and He was also off colour and lack-lustre like the Āḻvār! It was only when His union with the Āḻvār materialised, that He regained His original complexion and composure, heightened by the extra lustre imparted by the exuberance of His joy in the coveted company of the Āḻvār. The Āḻvār, who took due note of this marvellous reciprocity on the part of the Lord, got choked down to a trance state, as he meditated on the Lord’s amazing simplicity and boundless love for him. This was the third and the last spell of suspended animation, passed through by the Āḻvār, who was struck dumb and insensate every time he contemplated the Supreme Lord’s extreme simplicity in bringing Himself down on a par with His devotees and some times, even relegating Himself lower still. Every time, this trance-state lasted six months, as seen from aphorism 58 of ‘Ācārya Hṛdayam’ and Śrī Maṇavāḷa Māmuṉi‘s glossary thereon; the two earlier stages pertain to I-3-1 and V-10-1.

\(ii\) The description of the Lord and His mighty weapons, (which in the eyes of the Āḻvār loom, more as lovely jewels decorating the Lord) is that of the rejuvenated Lord, on His getting lodged in the Āḻvār’s heart. This could also fit in with line 2 of Śrīman Nāthamuni’s śloka, ‘Yadgosahaśraṃ apahanti..........’, in adoration of Saint Nammāḻvār, as per the former’s yogic comprehension. There it has been said that the Bakula-flowered (Narcissus) Nammāḻvār is the Sun, beaming through the thousand rays of Tiruvāymoḻi, where Lord Śrīman Nārāyaṇa resides, wielding His discus and conch and surrounded by His entire retinue, the region adored by the Brahmins learned in the Śrutis, the cynosure of the Celestials. (See also Introduction).

\(iii\) What the Āḻvār envisaged within him was like unto what meets one’s eyes when a box full of sparkling diamonds is thrown open.

**English translation of verse 8.8.2:**

The One, who does within me (His vassal) dwell,  
Stays in this body, as well, being the Inner Soul  
Of the worlds, one and all and the regions beyond, as well;  
Of fragrance unique and sweet like flawless honey is His bliss perennial,  
Higher than the highest, none can His modes fathom,  
He is the One, of knowledge supreme.

**Notes:**

The Āḻvār has high-lighted, in this song, ‘śeṣatva’ or exclusive service to the Lord, as the essential attirubute of the individual soul. Instead of saying that the Lord, Who pervades all things all over the worlds and the regions beyond (the external multiplicity of layers), stays within him and his body, he says, the Lord stays in this vassal (aṭiyēṉ) and the body (uṭal) as well. *The Āḻvār has thus identified his soul, as the servant (vassal) of the Lord, thereby bringing to the fore, the ‘Śeṣatva’ (servanthood) attribute of the Soul*. Although the word ‘aṭiyēṉ’ (self) occurs in various other songs of the Āḻvār and even in the very first song of his first hymnal (Tiruviruttam), it has connoted, in all other places, the embodied soul and not the soul, as such.

Of the two principal attributes of the Individual soul, namely, ‘Jñātṛtva’ (bliss of wisdom or knowledge) and ‘śeṣatva’ (service to the Lord), why should the latter alone be taken as the essential attribute of the soul, in preference to the former? This has been examined at great length in aphorism 73 of ‘Śrīvacana Bhūṣaṇam’. It is reproduced below.

If ‘Jñātṛtva’ is held to be the sole attribute of the soṇṭ, this is also the attribute of the Lord and hence it is necessary to bring out the distinguishing feature of the individual soul. If, on the other hand, ‘Śeṣatva’ is held to be the sole attribute of the soul, this attribute is applicable to ‘Acit’ (non-sentient matter), as well, and it cannot, therefore, be the distinguishing feature of the soul. And so, both the attributes of the ‘Jīva’ (soul), namely, ‘Jñātṛtva’ and ‘Śeṣatva’ are attracted. We now come back to the question, as to which of these two should be considered the essential attribute of the soul. Could it be ‘Jñātṛtva’, which stamps out the soul from the unintelligent matter or ‘Śeṣatva’ which differentiates ‘Jīva’ from ‘Īśvara’ (Lord)? ‘Śeṣatva’ or service unto the Lord, being that which sustains the individual soul and makes it thrive, this attribute naturally comes to the fore, relegating the other attribute to the back-ground. The assumption of ‘Jñātṛtva as the essential attribute of the ‘Jīva’, would place it on a par with the Lord and this smacks of ‘Advaita’ or non-difference between the two entities. This is effectively quelled by the ‘Śeṣatva’ aspect of the ‘Jīva’. When this topic came up for discussion in Saint Rāmānuja’s holy court of religious discussions, the Saint, although perfectly informed in the maṭṭer, wished to get it expounded by his Guru, Tirukkōṭṭiyūr Nampi. Kūrattāḻvāṉ, the illustrious disciple of Saint Rāmānuja, was sent, all the way to Tirukkottiyur to learn from Nampi the truth, in this regard. Even after waiting on Nampi for six long months, Āḻvān could not obtain from the great-preceptor, any hint. But, when he sought Nampi’s permist sion to return to Srīrangam, the latter condescended, at long last, to pin-point the truth admirably, by pointing out: “Son, don’t you know that Saint Nammāḻvār, inspired and endowed by the Lord Himself with perfect knowledge, has said ‘*Atiyēṉ uḷḷāṉ*’ (*the opening words of this song*)?” Grasping at once the implication of this, Āḻvāṉ exclaimed with joy, “Good Sire, I am indeed blessed, I have known the truth” and returned to his Master at Srirangam. The exact import of these two words has already been set out in sub para above.

**English translation of verse 8.8.3:**

To get at the overlord of the celestials of knowledge profound,  
I did His grace invoke, impounding Him in my thoughtful desires;  
Even this act of mine was by His sweet grace ordained,  
Getting inside me thus, He did make me wholly averse  
To the earthly moorings, body and soul, pleasures sensual  
And allied knowledge; He did unto me fully reveal  
The essential nature of the soul, as His exclusive vassal,  
Who can’t, apart from Him, remain viable.

**Notes:**

By His spontaneous grace, the Supreme Lord made the Āḻvār God-bent and also revealed unto him, the true nature of his Soul, in order to stabilise his God-love, to the exclusion of everything else. The true nature of the Soul, as belonging to the Lord, as His exclusive vassal, and remaining but His mode, His very body, was disclosed to the Āvḻār so that he shall not shrink back from Him, any longer.




## 8.8.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

யானும் தானாய் ஒழிந்தானை யாதும் எவர்க்கும் முன்னோனை

**English translation of verse 8.8.4:**

Realised have the one unto whom I stand indissolubly bound;  
My soul, which does thro’ my body, spirit and intellect extend,  
Is His body, delectable unto Him like honey, milk, candy and nectar,  
To things and beings, one and all, He is anterior,  
The Primate unique, who did the Trinity compose and stand  
Alongside Civaṉ and Piramaṉ, whose functions He ordained.

**Notes:**

The Lord has now made the Āḻvār aware of the fact that his soul is indeed extremely delectable to Him. No doubt, all things and beings, with different forms and names, were ushered in by Him alone, and yet, in the process, He pursued different modes of operation. The ungodly and those not bent towards Him were created solely in the light of their past actions; Brahmā, Rudra and other Devas, hankering after wealth and power, were assigned positions where they could wield such power and command wealth; in the case of the Āḻvār, however, He demonstrated unto him the fact of his soul being exclusively His, highly enjoyed by Him, thereby making him realise that he is not apart from Him, being but His body, an attribute to Him, as whiteness is to a white wall or white cloth. Prior to the dawn of this knowledge, the individual relished the soul as his own and now he relishes the soul as the Lord’s, even as the Lord lavishes his affections on it as His attribute.

**English translation of verse 8.8.5:**

The subtle beauty of the Soul, eternal and intelligent, the Lord’s attribute,  
None can comprehend, in terms concrete, as this or that  
And much less visualise;’tis indeed very much apart  
From matter and does its components, one by one, excel;  
One can’t with things material compare and tell,  
’Tis good or bad and yet He did reveal  
Unto me, in its true perspective, my soul.

**Notes:**

In the opening song of this hymnal (1-1-1), the Āḻvār acknowledged the fact that he had been graciously endowed. by the Lord with knowledge, full and complete. Knowledge of his soul, its characteristics, special features and interrelation with the Lord etc., would have doubtless been imparted to him then, as part of the vast range of that knowledge. The emphasis, however, rested on God-love (matinalam) and all that knowledge acquired by the Āḻvār got rooted in it. (Bhaktirūpāpanna Jñāna). The Āḻvār did not, therefore, turn his attention to the study of his soul, as such, a mere firefly, compared with the splendour of the Supreme Lord. It has, however, become necessary now for the Lord to impress upon the Āḻvār the grandeur of his soul and its glorious impact on Him, in the particular context, explained in the preamble to this decad. The Lord has now condescended to exhibit the soul as His mode, that is, one related to Him, as the predicate is to the subject or attribute

is to substance. Even the wisest and the best informed individuals, with the most strenuous mental effort (yoga) or psychic meditation, cannot perceive this wonderful entity, the soul (Ātmā) not comparable with the external objects, with form and content, discerned by the senses. The soul transcends the several vestures veiling it, which could be grouped as ‘body’ (annamaya) or as the senses, ‘prāṇa’ or the vital spirit (Prāṇamaya) or ‘manas’ (manomaya), the mind, or ‘buddhi’, the will. Not falling within the mischief of the modifications and corruptions to which all these are subject, the soul is very subtle and distinct from any of these, not cognisable as ‘good’ or ‘bad’, being outside the purview of sense-knowledge.

Neither by speech nor by any process of thought would it be possible to disclose the true nature of the soul in its entirety, even by those who have made great advance in spiritual knowledge. c.f. what the Lord said to Arjuna in Bhagavad Gītā.—

> “To know, to see and to enter into the true nature of the soul is
> difficult”.

The soul is thus, by itself, a unique entity (truth), characterised by its own special attributes of intelligence (jñāna) and bliss (ānanda).

As the illustrious Ācārya Empār would put it, in the preceding songs, the soul was referred to as an appendage to the Lord, His dependent, an attribute (viśeṣaṇa), the Lord being the substance (viśeṣya); in the four songs commencing from this one, the soul is dealt with as a singular entity, characterised by its own attributes of intelligence (jñāna) and bliss (ānanda).




## 8.8.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நன்றாய் ஞானம் கடந்துபோய் நல்இந்திரியம் எல்லாம் ஈர்த்து

**English translation of verse 8.8.6:**

If one can the cruel senses discard, going well beyond.  
The sense-objects and the sprawling domain of matter transcend,  
Discern the soul as a distinct entity and its true natu e comprehend.  
Abjure, with all one’s heart, the fruits of actions, good and bad,  
There and there lies the realisation of the soul from bondage freed.

**Notes:**

The Āḻvār sets out here the enormous effort needed for the perception of one’s soul, dissociated from its material moorings, through the Yogic practices, aimed at the conquest of the senses etc. The practicant has to discern, first of all, the soul as a separate entity, apart from the inert natter with which it is intricately wound up, like oil in seeds, fire in wood etc. The next step will be to get oneself weaned away from the sensual pleasures, the Prakṛti or matter-oriented desires, which are little better than one aspiring for a rich harvest in a vast desert area, a huge waste land, non-cultivable and, therefore, lying fallow. Even after giving up the inert matter as unavailing, the acts giving rise to the fruits, know as ‘Puṇya’ and ‘Papa’ will get one stuck up in worldly life. Therefore, these should also be given up with no chance of their revival, by striking at the roots and cutting out the age-long propensities and the odours driven underground. The soul, thus released from bondage, could, unless the practicant was short-sighted, merely looking upon such emancipation as the final goal, be steeped in the eternal service of the Lord without let or hindrance, the destined goal. The other alternative will be to get lost in self-enjoyment, the disembodied soul enjoying itself, without turning its attention on the service of the Lord. Of course, this alternative which the Āḻvār has elsewhere, in this hymnal, referred to as a great disaster, is indeed farthest from his mind.




## 8.8.7
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அதுவே வீடு வீடு பேற்று இன்பம்தானும் அதுதேறி  
எதுவே தானும் பற்றுஇன்றி யாதும் இலிகள்ஆகிற்கில்  
அதுவே வீடு வீடு பேற்று இன்பம்தானும் அதுதேறாது  
'எதுவே வீடு ஏது இன்பம்?' என்று எய்த்தார் எய்த்தார் எய்த்தாரே.

atuvē vīṭu vīṭu pēṟṟu iṉpamtāṉum atutēṟātu  
'etuvē vīṭu ētu iṉpam?' eṉṟu eyttār eyttār eyttārē.

**English translation of verse 8.8.7:**

The vision thus gained, of the soul, the Lord’s attribute,  
Freed from worldly desires and material contacts, does constitute  
True emancipation and the bliss which from it accrues;  
Those, who are about this not clear and get confused,  
Will for ever remain so, “asking what is heaven and heavenly bliss?”

**Notes:**

The Āḻvār affirms that this and this alone (the *modus operandi*, indicated in the preceding song) is the way to achieve self-realisation and the bliss resulting therefrom. Attempts made, in any other manner, will not fructify. It is only through a total abandonment of all desires passing in one’s mind, except the desire for the ‘Ātman’ (Self, forming the Lord’s attribute), with no chances of their sprouting again, one is said to be steady in the knowledge of the Self (Bhagavad Gītā II.55). With a mind steadied in this manner, the vision of the soul is acquired and such an acquisition is, however, worthless, if it does not hinge upon the service of the Lord, in keeping with the essential nature of the soul.

**English translation of verse 8.8.8:**

One has indeed to steer clear of all temptations,  
The spurt of desires and fix the mind, in great devotion,  
On the Lord during those lingering, last moments  
Of one’s life, when friends and relations gather around and lament,  
Wailing aloud, “oh, he is gone! he is gone! he is gone!”  
With their minds agitated, like unto madmen.

**Notes:**

The Āḻvār stresses here the importance of meditation on the Lord, with absolute calm and clarity, during the last moments of one’s life, when the whole scene is so tense and bewildering, what with the wanton wailing of the relatives and friends and the terrible off-chance of a sudden spurt of all suppressed desires and unrealised ambitions. It is noteworthy that even stanzas four to eight of this decad, which deal with the characteristics of the ‘Jīva’ (Individual Soul) are rooted in the ‘Śeṣatva’ (servanthood) aspect of the soul. The Āḻvār is indeed grateful to the Lord for such revelation.




## 8.8.9
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கூடிற்றாகில் நல்உறைப்பு கூடாமையைக் கூடினால்

**English translation of verse 8.8.9:**

It will be good, no doubt, if there can be a blend  
Of the soul with the Super-Soul but it will be a notion blind,  
That the soul could itself become the Lord with the flying bird  
On His banner, oh, what a grotesque misfit indeed!  
Pity! there exist such perverts gross, at all times, who wallow  
In family ties, with all fanciful notions of the final goal.

**Notes:**

\(i\) Meditation of the Lord during the last moments of one’s life, emphasised by the Āḻvār in the preceding song, stresses incidentally the basic difference between the two entities, namely, the ‘Jīva’ (individual soul) and ‘Paramātmā’ (īśvara, the Supreme Lord). Unfortunately, there are perverts, extant in this world at all times, who propagate fanciful notions that the individual soul, rid of nescience, becomes ‘Brahman’ and thereafter, there is but a single entity, namely, ‘Brahman’, the other entity, the ‘Jīva’ having ceased to exist, as such. The Āḻvār now condemns such heresies.

\(ii\) If the impossible happens, that is, the incompatibles blending into one, as in the fanciful event of the individual soul and the Super-Soul (the Supreme Lord) blending into a single entity, the Āḻvār wonders what a grotesque and preposterous misfit it would turn out to be. The individual soul can then be the Master of Garuḍa, the Eternal Hero and fly on him. But this cannot be, flying on Garuḍa being the sole prerogative of the Lord. It is indeed a pity that there have been in the past, there are at present and there will be in the future, persons expounding such heretical doctrines according to their individual fancies.

**English translation of verse 8.8.10:**

Unto His devotees He can never cease to be and does always subsist  
While, unto others, He is not, though He does always exist;  
Such a unique Lord does in my heart now subsist,  
And in me knowledge clear prevails, with no fluctuation  
Like the Moon waxing and waning, darkness and sunshine.

**Notes:**

The Āḻvār rejoices that the Lord, who enthralled him by exhibiting His auspicious traits, exquisite beauty and cosmic wealth, has now entered his heart, dispelling all doubts and discrepancies to which the perverts succumb and infusing in him knowledge, steady and sound, unlike the fluctuating fortunes of the Sun and the Moon. The solar day is followed by the dark night while the Moon waxes for some time and then wanes. The Āḻvār’s knowledge of the Divine is, however, not subject to such fluctuations, rise and fall.

**English translation of verse 8.8.11:**

The Lord of sapphire hue will bless and under His feet retain  
The chanters of these songs ten out of the unique thousand of Caṭakōpaṉ,  
Blest by Tirumāl (Lord Supreme), Who inside Ayaṉ and Civaṉ, stays,  
As their Internal Controller, infuses knowledge, firm and sound, and takes  
His devotees unto His victorious feet, with lovely anklets of gold bedecked.

**Notes:**

All knowledge that militates against God-love and God-enjoyment will be rooted out and unalloyed knowledge of the Divine infused in the chanters of this decad by the Supreme Lord who discharges the triple functions of creation, sustentation and dissolution, the first and last being got done by Brahmā and Rudra, Himself standing within them as their Internal Controller. What more? They shall be lifted by Him unto His lovely feet, without being allowed to bow unto others and fall at their feet.
