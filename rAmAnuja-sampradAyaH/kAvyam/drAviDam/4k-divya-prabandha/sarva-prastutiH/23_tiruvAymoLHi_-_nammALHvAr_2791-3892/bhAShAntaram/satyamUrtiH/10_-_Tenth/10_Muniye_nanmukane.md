## 00 Intro10.10
It was indeed a rude jolt to the Āḻvār, who was shocked into a sense of stark reality, when he opened his eyes and found that he was still seated where he was, namely, the hollow inside the trunk of the tamarind tree, in the precincts of Lord Ādinātha’s temple in Āḻvār Tirunakari. It now transpired to him that his ascent to heaven, through the exhilarating ‘Arcirādi mārga’, the honours lavished on him by the various agencies all along the route and at the destination, his stay in the midst of the ‘Nityās’ and ‘Muktās’ in the gem-set hall, where the Lord and His Divine Consort were holding Durbar, all these, expatiated on by him in the preceding decad, were but the figments of his imagination, a mere mental comprehension and nothing more. Eaten up by the cruel pangs of frustration at that he is still lingering in the unenviable mesh of ‘Prakṛti’ (matter), the Āḻvār now cries out his heart unto the Lord, in a manner that is bound to melt even those utterly devoid of tenderness of heart. Oh, what a pity! the Lord, who is fully aware of the Āḻvār’s utter helplessness and sole dependence on Him, has chosen to keep him still tethered to the material body. Like unto the suckling, tormented by deep thirst and pinching hunger, despite the parents being near at hand, crying out lustily, the Āḻvār calls out the Lord. Voicing forth his deep yearning with the utmost effort, like the full-throated call for relief from one engulfed by wild fire, the Āḻvār compels the immediate attention and succour of the Lord. It would indeed be well-nigh impossible for the Lord, at this stage, to stick to His seat in Heaven anymore, without responding to the ardent call of a devotee of the calibre of Nammāḻvār.

Weighed down by a gnawing sense of guilt, the merciful Lord, of remarkable tenderness of heart, felt even more depressed than the Āḻvār himself. And so, the Lord and His Divine Consort rushed down, mounted on Garuḍa, flying at supersonic speed. The Lord cut out the Āḻvār’s material contacts *in toto* and led him to the transcendental sanctum (Śrī Vaikuṇṭa). And there, in the high Heaven, the ultimate destination of the yearning soṇṭ, the Āḻvār entered the august gathering of the great devotees of Lord Vaikuntanāthaṉ and mingled freely with them, the joyous intercourse with this holy band in the exalted land, pined for by him since long, thus becoming an accomplished fact. According to the Āḻvār’s own admission, in this decad, vide stanza 10, the Lord’s love for him outgrew his own and made it dwindle down to naught. The Āḻvār’s love for the Lord progressed by stages, as one can perceive, going through the entire gamut of this grand hymnal and currently, it hat attained its full stature (Parama Bhakti), outstripping all else, assuming supra-cosmic proportions, even to the extent of enveloping the Lord Himself. The Lord, however, forestalled the Āḻvār, enveloped his ‘avā’ (deep love) and thereby held him in His sweet embrace. In the concluding stanza of this decad, which is also the grand finale of this great hymnal, the Āḻvār gives vent to his sense of completion and fulfilment, saying that he has reached the ultimate destination, all the impediments having been eradicated, root and branch.

The Supreme Lord, Śrīman Nārāyaṇa is the Subject sung about in this hymnal which, in the Āḻvār’s own words, is styled as ‘avāvil antāti’, a species of prosody, charged with ‘Bhakti’, in which the closing word of each song is the opening word of the next one. Saint Śaṭhakopa, the Lord’s own poet, endowed by Him with divine knowledge, full and perfect, clear and concise, is the grand author of this glorious hymnal. The Āḻvār’s advent in this world was indeed on a par with that of the Lord, both being due to the great, good fortune of the meritorious ‘sādhius’, the devout, immersed in incessant contemplation of the divine.

**English translation of verse 10.10.1:**

Oh, Lord of fruit-like reddish lips and lotus eyes, You are the sage,  
Contemplating the ways of creation; Internal Controller of all, You stay  
Inside the four-headed Brahmā and Rudra, the triple-eyed; Your Form exquisite,  
Like virgin sapphire, You did unto me exhibit  
And covertly won me over, dear unto me exclusively like life,  
You have on my head alighted and I shan’t let You go off;  
Play not your wily pranks on me, in love with you, so deep.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The Āḻvār pleads lustily that the Lord should no longer keep him in bondage, after having spontaneously induced in him God-love and God-hunger of this magnitude. The Lord is addressed, in this song, as the Sage (Muni), Who contemplates and conceives the projects pertaining to the creation of the Universe, its sustenance and dissolution and gets the work of creation and dissolution, discharged by Brahmā and Rudra respectively, permeating their souls as the Internal Controller. There is absolutely no question of parity among Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Rudra and, at any rate, the Āḻvār would be the last person to think in terms of such parity and, much less, throw the slightest hint or suggestion to this effect, seeing that he has already expounded indubitably the supremacy of Lord Viṣṇu, in I-1, II-2 and IV-10. If the Lord has been addressed in this song (as per the original text) as, “Oh, four-headed Brahmā,” “Oh, triple-eyed Rudrā,” it only connotes the body-soul relationship of the Lord and His subjects, the entire Universe and all beings therein constituting, as it were, His bodies, Himself pervading them all, as the Inner Controller, the Super Soul, c.f. also VI-9-1 where the Āḻvār has referred to the Lord as pervading the five elements, Sun and Moon, Śiva and Brahmā, as the Inner Controller of them all.

\(ii\) The Lord’s ‘Viśvarūpa’ (Universal Form) apart, the Āḻvār dotes on His unique Form (Divya Maṅgala Vigraha) of exquisite charm. It is by exhibiting this enchanting Form that the Lord enticed the Āḻvār and made him God-bent, a great gesture of spontaneous grace, bestowed on the Āḻvār, unasked and unsolicited, at a time when he was least inclined towards God. And now, the Āḻvār, so transformed, cannot subsist without Him and he will have nothing to do with the worldlings either, in whose wretched company he was wallowing all along. He would, therefore, be neither here nor there, if the Lord too gave him up, after having kindled in him God-love of such astounding proportions that he is seen to possess.

\(iii\) “*I shan't let You go off*”: “Ofcourse, *not at this stage*, when You have weaned me away from my erstwhile plight as a ‘Samsāri’, earth-bound and sense-buried and, on the top of such reclamation, made me partake of the supreme bliss of intimate intercourse with you. Well, you have also been pleased to bring within my comprehension the heavenly bliss and the exhilarating route leading to Heaven. You shall not give me up, any more.” The Āḻvār thus compels and binds the Lord, by reason of his inordinate longing for Him and His inescapable obligation to redeem him. c.f. Bharatā’s behaviour in Citrakūṭ, in an all-out effort to induce Śrī Rāma to curtail his exile and go back to Ayodhyā, to take over the reins of the kingdom.




## 10.10.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வாசம்செய் பூங்குழலாள் திருஆணை நின்ஆணை கண்டாய்

**English translation of verse 10.10.2:**

On oath do I put Your Consort Divine,  
That perfect lady whose locks emit fragrance fine,  
Like unto the garland You do on Your lovely chest don;  
I put You also on oath, You did court me on Your own  
And mingled with me freely as if You and I were one;  
Play You shan’t Your wily pranks on me any more  
But call me up to Your lovely feet, delaying no more.

**Notes:**

There was no immediate response to the Āḻvār’s call, as in the last song. And so, he repeats that the Lord should not side-track him and keep him in bondage, as hitherto, on one pretext or another. The Āḻvār’s yearning is so deep that he even binds the Lord and His consort, the Divine Mother, irresistibly upon oath, to fulfil his longing, too deep for words. When the Lord turned round and called the Āḻvār’s attention to the impropriety of his binding Him on oath, cutting at the root his essential nature of total dependence on Him as His exclusive vassal, the Āḻvār justifies his stance quite well: The Lord mingled freely with him and loved him even more than His Consort, Mahā-lakṣmī, completely identifying Himself with him. The up-surge of love unto Him, thus generated in the Āḻvār, grew intense beyond words and it was the exuberance of this love that induced the Āḻvār to move to such incredible lengths for sheer survival through speedy restoration to Him.




## 10.10.3
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கூவிக்கொள்ளாய் வந்துஅந்தோ! என்பொல்லாக் கருமாணிக்கமே!  
ஆவிக்குஓர் பற்றுக்கொம்பு நின்அலால் அறிகின்றி லேன்யான்  
மேவித்தொழும் பிரமன் சிவன் இந்திரன் ஆதிக்குஎல்லாம்

**English translation of verse 10.10.3:**

Oh, my Lord, sweet like virgin sapphire, from Your navel did sprout  
The lotus stalk that gave rise to Piramaṉ and thro’ him,  
Civaṉ, Intiraṉ and all else, Who are unto you devout,  
And there are the exalted Celestials in Heaven and unto them  
Very dear You are; prop unto my life I see not  
Any but You. May You, alas! call me up to Your lotus feet.

**Notes:**

\(i\) Like unto the thirsty who cry out, “water! water!”, the Āḻvār, who is God-thirsty, repeats his call for the Lord’s succour. Notwithstanding the exuberance of his love for God, it is hardly meet that he should rush unto Him on his own, nor would it redound to the credit of the Lord, if the Āḻvār did so. Therefore it is, the Āḻvār insists that the Lord should come and take him on to the heavenly abode. Of course, the Lord could take His own time and lift the Āḻvār up, in due course and there would have been no question of the Āḻvār being so importunate, urging for quick consummation in the manner he is now doing, if only the Lord had not exhibited to the Āḻvār His intoxicating beauty and His immaculate Form of exquisite charm and sent the Āḻvār mad with love unto Him. Even as a creeper needs a prop to nestle around for its very growth and subsistence, the Āḻvār seeks to cuddle round the Lord for sheer survival. Did not Lakṣmaṇa tell Rāma, “neither I nor Sītā can subsist, when apart from You”? ‘naca Sītā tvayāhīnā.........”—Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, II-53-31.

\(ii\) When the Lord turned round and queried whether the Āḻvār had any merit in him, commensurate with the gain aspired for by him, the Āḻvār pointed out that even Brahmā and other Celestials, in the higher echelons, were totally dependent on His grace for whatever they wished to accomplish and that the Lord should not, therefore, expect or look for any merit in him. Actually, the Āḻvār is one better than that exalted band, as the latter would not even acknowledge and declare, as the Āḻvār does, that there is no prop for them other than the Lord.




## 10.10.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

உம்பர்அம்தண் பாழேஓ! அதனுள்மிசை நீயேஓ

**English translation of verse 10.10.4:**

My Lord, You are the Controller great of one and all,  
The primordial matter and the myriads of souls lodged therein,  
The spatial ether, the radiant fire and other elements as well,  
The cosmic egg which holds Piramaṉ, Araṉ and others within,  
The sage You are, Who did create the Devas, the humans  
And the other species, keeping in mind their past actions;  
To salve me You did come forward, on Your own  
But still you do keep me here, lingering on.

**Notes:**

\(i\) In a vacant piece of land one can raise any crop according to one’s predilection, and so, in the vast vacant land of Primordial Matter (Mūla Prakṛti) can be sown multifarious seeds, yielding a vast variety of crops of enjoyment as well as emancipation, that either bind the souls, the tenants tilling the soil, or work up to their release from such bondage.

\(ii\) Unto the Lord, the Universal Controller, the Matter, the elements emanating therefrom, the different species of beings inhabiting the created worlds with their colourful varieties, all these constitute, as it were, His bodies, and He is the Super-Soul, pervading them all.

\(iii\) So far as the Āḻvār is concerned, he is fully aware, against the background, set forth above, that the Lord is very keen to salve him and yet, he is indeed puzzled why he is still kept on, in this abode. “Does it not smack of indifference on Your part?” the Āḻvār is now asking the Lord.




## 10.10.5
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

போரவிட்டிட்டு என்னை நீபுறம்போக்கலுற்றால் பின்னையான்-

ārapparuka eṉakku ārāamutuāṉāyē.

**English translation of verse 10.10.5:**

You are unto me the nectar insatiable,  
That does fully quench my God-thirst abnormal,  
Like the red-hot iron having its fill, jolly well,  
When dipped in water and yet if You, my Lord,  
Gave me up and kept me aside, [in sensual pleasures buried,]  
What can this frail being achieve and by what means?  
Alas! what am I and what is mine?

**Notes:**

\(i\) The Āḻvār deplores his sad plight; he feels that he has been woefully despised by the Lord, despite His role as the great Universal Protector and His omnipotence, reducing him to the unenviable predicament in which he finds himself nowhere. Neglected by the Lord, the Āḻvār betrays his utter helplessness, neither he nor any one else can help him. And so, he feels done up.

\(ii\) Even as the red-hot iron, dipped in water, drinks all that water, needed to cool it down effectively, the Lord exhibited His exquisite charm to the Āḻvār, so as to entice his soul and consume it, in full.




## 10.10.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

எனக்கு ஆராஅமுதாய் எனதுஆவியை இன்உயிரை  
மனக்குஆராமை மன்னி உண்டிட்டாய் இனிஉண்டொழியாய்  
புனக்காயாநிறத்த புண்டரீகக்கண் செங்கனிவாய்

**English translation of verse 10.10.6:**

Oh, Lord of lily hue, lotus eyes and reddish lips beautiful!  
Dear unto the lotus-born Divine Mother, matching You so well,  
Unto me You are love incarnate, the nectar insatiable,  
You did consume alike my material body and soul delectable  
And still feel that You didn’t have Your heart’s fill,  
You have perforce to consume what remains of me still.

**Notes:**

\(i\) If the Lord loved His Consort, Mahālakṣmī intensely, He was the very personification of love unto the Āḻvār. That being the case, the Āḻvār rightly points out to the Lord that He can ill-afford to despise him now.

\(ii\) Unlike the nectar that was once churned from the Milkocean and distributed to the Devas, the Āḻvār enjoys the Lord’s nectarean charm, in an ever increasing measure, it being ever fesh [fresh?] and inexhaustible. What a grand setting indeed! The lotus-born Mahālakṣmi, a perfect match unto the Lord of exquisite charm, of the complexion of the lily in fresh bloom, the eyes resembling the red lotus flower, just blossomed, and the lips, radiant like the red fruit. The Divine Mother is “Bhagavan Nārāyaṇa abhimatānurūpa”, as stated by Śrī Rāmānuja in the opening line of ‘Śaraṇāgathi Gadya’. She is both ‘Abhimatha’ (dear) and ‘Anurūpa’ (a good match) unto Lord Nārāyaṇa.

\(iii\) The Lord’s fascination for the Āḻvār did not stop with his soul but extended to his physical body, as well. Even so, there was no satiety for Him and seeing this, the Āḻvār would urge Him to go the whole hog out and consume him, in full, without throwing him out, half way through.




## 10.10.7
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கோல மலர்ப்பாவைக்கு அன்புஆகிய என் அன்பேயோ  
நீலவரை இரண்டு பிறைகவ்வி நிமிர்ந்தது ஒப்ப  
கோல வராகம்ஒன்றாய் நிலம்கோட்டிடைக் கொண்ட எந்தாய்

nīlak kaṭalkaṭaintāy! uṉṉaipeṟṟu iṉip pōkkuvaṉō? (2)

**English translation of verse 10.10.7:**

Loved am I by You, Oh, Lord, as the one dear  
Unto Your Consort, Lakṣmī, the lotus-born;  
You did pull the Earth out, on Your tusks, oh, Sire,  
As the blissful Boar unique, like a sapphire mountain  
Rising up, gripping two Moons,; the ocean blue You did churn,  
Once having gained You, shall I now let you slip down?

**Notes:**

\(i\) It is a simple, yet irresistible argument, advanced by the Āḻvār. He said: “My Lord, what a mighty exploit You undertook, assuming the form of a great boar with gigantic tusks, protruding miles long, for reclaiming Mother Earth from the deep waters of the deluge! Again, You did chum the very ocean for getting at my other Mother, Mahālakṣmī, the lotus-born. They are exceedingly dear to You and likewise, I am dear unto them. Therefore it is, You are dear to me and it was no mean effort on Your part to get at me, sunk deep in the ocean of Saṃsāra, a mighty effort, comparable with your aforesaid exploits. Once bound to You, in this manner, I am indeed very secure; neither You can shake me off nor I can let you slip off”.

\(ii\) *The Lord’s advent as the Blissful Boar*. In Tiruviruttam, the first of the four hymnals of the Āḻvār, he banks upon the grace of ‘Varāha Mūrthi’, the Lord’s incarnation as the Blissful Boar and ends up by reinforcing this point. It is but appropriate that he should revert to this, as he concludes ‘Tiruvāymoḻi’, the last of his hymnals. The Earth having got submerged under the deep waters of the great deluge, the Lord pulled it out on His tusks; and here is a grand poetic imagery. The Lord, in the form of the magnificent Boar, with two protruding tusks gleaming white, rising from beneath the waters, picking up Mother Earth, is compared to a sapphire mountain rising up, gripping two Moons. While the Lord is compared to a Sapphire mountain and His two white protruding tusks are compared to two Moons, there is no mention of the Earth mounted on the Lord’s teeth, as it just faded out of sight in that moon-shine (the gleaming tusks).

\(iii\) *Churning the blue ocean*: No doubt, it was the Milkocean that was churned but it is referred to, by the Āḻvār, as the blue ocean, due to the blue shade cast on it by the Lord of bluish hue. c.f. śloka 45 of Śrī Parāśara Bhaṭṭar’s “Śrī Raṅgarāja Sthavaṃ” (apipaṇipathi bhāvāth......) wherein the illustrious author describes the dome (vimāna), just above the Sanctum Sanctorum where Lord Raṅganātha reposes on serpent-bed. Although the dome is white, symbolising, as it does, Ādi-Śeṣa of white complexion, yet it gleams splendidly, says the author, like the blue sea, because of the upward dispersal of the rays of bluish tint from the Lord’s resplendent form of sapphire hue, down below.




## 10.10.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

**English translation of verse 10.10.8:**

You are the Architect of acts good and bad, the souls indulge,  
You are also the Inner Controller of the souls steeped in bondage;  
Pleasure and pain, for acts good and bad, You deal out,  
The Three worlds, the dense bush of Samsāṛa, You did create,  
None can see You but yet the bush dense You permeate;  
The Redeemer great, You did in me kindle love for You,  
My Prop unique You are, how indeed can I leave You?

**Notes:**

\(i\) “How can the body outlive the soul, supporting it from within?” queries the Āḻvār. If, at the moment, the Āḻvār is soaked in God-love and he looks upon God as his Sole Sustainer, it is due entirely to the special efforts made by the Lord since long, directed towards the Āḻvār’s redemption. When the Āḻvār declares that he cannot let go the Lord, after having been united to Him so intimately, he means to say that he shall not subsist without Him and his very survival is, therefore, contingent upon his union with Him.

\(ii\) The main purpose of this song would appear to be to bring home to the Lord that He is all in all, the Great Redeemer and Sole Sustainer of all beings and that He should not, therefore, look for any merit, as such, in the Āḻvār, to compel His attention and warrant the influx of His grace.

**English translation of verse 10.10.9:**

Oh, Lord, You are the triple cause that did usher  
The worlds three and all things therein; You pervade all over,  
Things and beings, one and all, You control the primordial matter,  
As the Primate unique; the sentient beings eternal that enter  
The material habitat and direct, with their pervasive power of intelligence,  
You ordain; the Causeless Cause unique! to behold the effulgence  
Of Your Form unique in Heaven, when do I Your feet attain?

**Notes:**

\(i\) Transforming Himself, as He does, into the worlds of forms and names, the Lord is the *Material* Cause of the Universe, just like clay for pot, cotton for cloth and so on. The Lord is also the *instrumental cause* like potter for the pots, weaver for the cloth etc. When the period of the great ‘Pralaya’ (deluge) draws to its close, the Lord, at His sweet volition and ‘Saṅkalpa’, the wishful thinking, “May I become manifold!”, separates into its constituent elements, the whole mass of the enjoying souls and their objects of enjoyment, remembering distinctly the constitution of the worlds prior to ‘praḷaya’. The Lord is, therefore, the *operative cause* as well, His jñāna (knowledge), Śakti (power) etc., being analogous to the potter’s wheel and staff, the weaver’s woof, bobbins, treadle etc. By His transformation into the world of men and matter is meant His immanence, as the Internal Controller of all, revealing the underlying unity of Brahman, qualified by the sentient beings and non-sentient things. He is thus the ‘Viśeṣya’, the substance present in all things, qualified by the ‘Viśeṣaṇa’ or attributes, namely, the sentient beings and non-sentient things. Whatever exists remains what it is, only because of His conjunction and so, ‘Cit’ (what perceives—the sentient being) and ‘Acit’ (what does not perceive—the non-sentient matter) constitute, as it were, the body of Brahman, who is the Super-Soul, pervading all over, things and beings, one and all.

\(ii\) While one can conceive, with respect to the external world of men and matter, the universal aspect of God-head, the Lord’s Viśvarūpa or Universal Form, the phenomenon behind the phenomenal world (the one behind the many, the hidden power behind the visible world of objects), the Āḻvārs, on their part, cannot remain content with a mere notional realisation of the Lord, as the all-pervading Force. They all pine for the Lord’s special Form, extra-ordinary indeed, His effulgent Form in the high Heaven, like a mount of emerald with sinewy arms, shoulders four, silken robes, the dazzling crown proclaiming His overlordship, lotus eyes, coral lips and so on, in the sweet company of His Divine Consort (Mahālakṣmī), surrounded by millions of ‘Muktas’ (Releasted Souls) and ‘Nityas’ (Ever free), in constant attendance on the Divine Couple, c.f. IV-9-10.

You did appease, in full, enclosing me in Your sweet embrace.

**Notes:**

It was the exuberance of the Āḻvār’s love unto God that egged him on to the extreme length of binding Him upon oath, in the name of His Consort, Śrī Mahālakṣmī, vide second song of this decad. The Lord could not but respond immediately to the ardent call of the Āḻvār, saturated with God-love. And so, He did hasten to the devotee and held him in tight embrace. This was the only way the Lord could avoid being engulfed by the Āḻvār’s love for Him, which had. by now. developed to such an enormous extent like whirlwind that it assumed supra-cosmic proportions, transcending all the three entities or principles, namely, matter (Acit), soul (Cit, the Jiva) and Īśvara (the Supreme Lord, the Inner Controller of one and all, the great Ordainer). Finding that the Lord had forestalled him and proved more than a match for him by shedding on him His love, far more intense than even his own, and thus setting him at rest, the Āḻvār gratefully acknowledges the Lord’s great gesture.

It is quite an ordinary principle, amply borne out by our everyday experience, that our longing for a particular object, however intense, ceases simultaneously with its fulfilment. In other words, the moment the object of our heart is achieved, the yearning therefor is set at naught—“Iccāyā viṣaya siddhyā nāśah”. For example, the thirst is quenched by drinking water and hunger vanishes when one is fed. And so, one way of interpreting this song would be, that the Āḻvār’s longing for the Lord, deep and intense beyond words though, ceased when he attained Him. There is yet another interpretation, far more interesting, rather, edifying. It is not as if the Āḻvār’s love, which had gathered momentum down the years, had been set at naught altogether but it dwindled down to negligible proportions, when compared with the Lord’s astounding love for him, as revealed in the finale of this great saga of Divine Love.

The Āḻvār’s love, which was fast encompassing all the three Principles like the forest fire of menacing proportions, pales into insignificance, having regard to the magnitude and intensity of the love now exhibited to him by the Lord, which is comparable to Śrī Rāma’s patronising and parental love to Bharata, on their reunion at the end of ṭhe long exile. Bharata was lifted by Rama unto his lap and held in sweet embrace, like unto the fond father fondling the child, restored to him after years of separation.

Exalted among those born are they, well-versed in these songs ten,  
Out of the thousand skilfully composed by Kurukūr Caṭakōpaṉ.  
Which mark the finale, the great consummation  
Of this God-love, too deep for words, his blissful union  
With Ari, the Redeemer great, the Internal Controller  
Of Ayaṉ and Araṉ, called out by him with remarkable ardour.

**Notes:**

\(i\) And now, we have come to the very end of this prolific hymnal, with its scintillating profusion of God-love (Bhakti) in the ascending scale of ‘Para Bhakti ‘Para jñāna and ‘Parama Bhakti’. Well, ‘Para Bhakti’ is confined to the four corners of mental experience and exhilaration, whetted by the alternation of delirious enjoyment of blissful rapport with the Lord (Saṃśleṣa) and bottom-most depths of dejection, desolation and despondency, due to the temporary withdrawal of the glorious vision of the Lord from the mind’s canvas (Viśleṣa). The Āḻvār was in this first stage only, right up to the end of the eighth decad of this centum. The next stage of ‘Para jñāna’ is denoted by the devotee’s love unto God, overflowing its erstwhile continent of mere mental comprehension, with an irresistible urge for external perception of the divine, in the manner longed for by the devotee; this stage was attained by the Āḻvār only in the preceding decad (10-9). And here, in this decad, we see the Āḻvār in the final stage, known as ‘Parama Bhakti’, the culmination, rather, consummation of his ‘Para Bhakti when he just cannot exist without the attainment of the glorious end in view, as set out by him in the ninth song of this decad (see the 2nd sub para of the notes thereunder). The Tamil phraseology, “Muṭinta avā”, in the original text of this song, is the exact equivalent of ‘Parama Bhakti’. As usual, this end-song also sets out the benefit accruing to the chanters of this decad, namely, they will be deemed by the devout, plunged in divine consciousness, as on a par with the denizens in Heaven, the ‘Nityas’ and ‘Muktas’, though born in this land of dark nescience. Only the materially-minded worldlings, earth-bound and sense-buried will look upon these chanters as mere fellow-travellers.

\(ii\) In I-4-6, where the Āḻvār (Paraṅkuśa Nāyakī) sent some birds as her emissaries to the Lord in a fit of desperation, she referred to the Lord as ‘aruḷāta nīr’ (You, Who wouldn’t shed your grace). Well, that was long, long ago, in the early stages of evolution of the Āḻvār’s God-love. And now, the same Lord is referred to, by the same Āḻvār as ‘Avāvaṟaccūḻ Aṟi’ (Hari, the great Deliverer whose all-conquering love has encompassed his own love for Him, of ultra-cosmic magnitude and made it dwindle down to naught and thus pale into insignificance). The Āḻvār called out the Lord lustily, addressing Him not only as ‘Hari’ but also as ‘Hai an’ and ‘Ayan the last two denoting, *prima facie*, Śiva and Brahmā, respectively, but actually, referring to the Supreme Lord, Mahā Viṣṇu, the In-Dweller, the internal Controller of Śiva, Brahmā and all else in the entire Universe, including the high Heaven. As a matter of fact, the Āḻvār has thus provided the clue to the proper appreciation of the Upaniṣadic texts, such as, “Sarvaṃ Kalvidhaṃ Brahmā”, “Ayidhatātmayaṃ idhaṃ sarvaṃ” etc., against the background of “Śarīra Śarīri bhāva”, body-soul relationship, dealt with, *in extenso*, in the foregoing notes, at the appropriate places).

\(iii\) Crying out unto the Lord lustily, soaked in God-love, the Āḻvār got all his erstwhile impediments, ills and evils, the outcome of the accumulated mass of his age-long sins, eradicated, root and branch, by the devastating love shed on him by the Supreme Lord and attained Him in that Eternal Land of endless bliss, the Lord Himself being the inexhaustible fountain source of all that bliss. The thousand and odd songs, comprised in this grand hymnal, flowed like a fountain from the love-laden heart of the Saint, the rapturous outpourings, *par excellence*, by-no-means comparable to the poetry of the mundane poets whose chief aim is to amass wealth and power, acquire name and fame, prostituting their poetic talents, in the ignominious process. As a matter of fact, there have been umpteen poets after the Āḻvār and their poems, one and all, are no more than the bellowing of the roaring sea, as compared to this hymnal (Tiruvāymoḻi) of the Āḻvār, whose songs were dictated by his God-love galore. Figuratively speaking, his God-love was the great teacher who made the Āḻvār reel out these thousand and odd songs, one after the other in succession, neatly juxtaposed.

In his inimitable diction, Aḻakiya Maṇavāḷa Perumāḷ Nāyaṉār describes, in aphorism 188 of ‘Ācārya Hṛdayam’, how Tiruvāymoḻi, this grand hymnal came into being. The knowledge, full and complete, clear and concise, imparted to the Āḻvār by the Lord Himself (See I-1-1), blossomed by His sweet grace into ‘Para Bhakti’ (intellectual love of God) which, in turn, developed into ‘Para Jñāna’ and ‘Parama Bhakti’ in the ascending order, as set out in the foregoing notes. So then, the Āḻvār can be likened to a lake, full of water, which successively turned into milk (Para Bhakti), ghee (Para Jñāna) and nectar (Parama Bhakti) and ultimately burst and inundated the outlying area, all around, the bund being unable to contain the upsurge and bombardment of its precious contents. And yet, there is this difference between the lake proper and the Āḻvār, figuratively referred to as the lake. Whereas the lake that breached would cause havoc to the adjoining roads, trees, villages and townships falling within the scope of the mischief of the gushing waters, the Āḻvār-lake, about to burst, was compassionate enough to prevent a similar devastation of the area around. These thousand and odd songs flowed through the lips of the Āḻvār, forming, as it were, the lake-bund. Into these songs, facile words and sweet phrases, competing with each other for participation in the glorious service unto mankind, at large, as intended by the Lord, slipped, as it were, into their proper places, according to the Āḻvār’s own admission. Thus, it was the ncctarean love for God, welling up the Āḻvār’s bosom, that overflowed its continent into these rapturous songs, numbering more than one thousand, the great treasure of divine love. It was not as if the Āḻvār sat in a quiet corner and composed these songs, with a set determination to do so. But it Was the upsurge of his devotion unto God, which forced him, as it Were, to deliver these songs (Avāvilantāti).




## Retrospective Summary
(10-1): With the clear awareness that the day of his promised ascent to heaven was near at hand, the Āḻvār set about preparing for his onward journey. Finding the Lord in His worshippable Form at Tirumōkūr, as the super-abundant Benefactor with profound knowledge and prowess, capable of steering through all obstacles on the way, the Āḻvār got hold of Him, as the unfailing Escort, during his onward march to the yonder Heaven. Apart from the Lord’s attainments, His bewitching beauty is enough to make the Āḻvār follow Him, enjoying His exquisite Form, all along. Such a Lord is lauded by the Āḻvār, *in the opening decad of this centum*, through appropriate songs, set in choice diction;

(10-2): *In the second decad*, the Āḻvār sings the glory of the Lord, enshrined at Tiruvaṉantapuram (Kerala State) and longs for the felicity of divine service unto the Lord. As we go on, we will find the Āḻvār calling successively at the holy centres of Tiruvāṭṭaṟu, Tirumāliruñcōlai, Tiruppēr and adoring the Lord, enshrined in those places. Having been assured of his ascent to Heaven, at the end of the current span of life, vide IX-10-5, Saint Nammāḻvār quite well knew that the day of his ascent was near at hand. That is why, he has actively embarked on a programme of leave-taking;

(10-3): The Āḻvār’s aspiration for divine service at Tiruvaṉantapuram-as in the preceding decad, did not materialise. So deep was his sense of frustration that it led him to suspect the frightful possibility of the Lord prolonging his stay in this abode. *In the third decad*, the Āḻvār, however, expresses his apprehension in an indirect way, cloaking his own misgivings by referring to those entertained by the shepherdesses of Bṛndāvana. These damsels started nagging Kṛṣṇa, the naughty cow-herd boy, even in the early hours of the morning, the pre-dawn period. The cool breeze is blowing, the koels have started cooing, the peacocks are strutting about and the herds of cows and calves are seen spread out, all over the place. So great is Kṛṣṇa’s loving care for the cattle that He would surely follow and tend them, relegating to the background His concern for the Gopīs who cannot, however, brook separation from Him even for a short while. Greatly agitated over the certainty of His departure from their midst on this particular morning also, as usual, they start experiencing the pangs of separation, even when He is still by their side. One of them would lustily plead with Him that He shall not leave them and go out into the fields, firstly, because they cannot bear being apart from Him for a whole day which actually looms like ages in their aching minds, and secondly, because of the lurking danger to His life, at the hands of Kaṃsa’s evil spies and agents, who keep on masquerading in one form or another, all over the place. This decad, however, ends on a jubilant note, with a sense of clarity induced by the Lord’s assurance to the Gopīs that He shall not depart from their midst. The Āḻvār’s misgivings also stand cleared up, a clarity induced by the Lord Himself.

(If our eminent preceptors referred to IX-9, as ‘Evening brawl’, they did label this *decad as* “ Morning squabble”).

(10-4): His erstwhile fears having been quelled, the jubilant Āḻvār gets busy in giving the finishing touches appropriate to this grand hymnal of unparalleled sweetness and grandeur. *In the fourth decad*, the Āḻvār sets out the benefits accruing to those pursuing the path of loving devotion unto the Lord besides recounting the benefits showered on him by the Lord, how the Lord contrived to get Himself lodged firmly in the Āḻvār’s heart, how complacent He feels after reaching that coveted destination and so on.

(10-5): Overwhelmingly conscious of the almost immediate prospect of his ascent to Heaven, the Āḻvār tenders his parting advice to the world *in the fifth decad*, the very last in the series of lectures delivered by him for the edification and elevation of the earth-bound, sense-buried men of the world. In this swan-song of the Āḻvār, he calls upon the worldly men to chant Lord Nārāyaṇa’s holy names and serve Him, in conjunction with Mahalakṣmī, the Divine Mother, by word (singing), deed (offering choice flowers) and thought (loving meditation).

(10-6): *In the sixth decad*, the Saint highlights the speed with which the Lord wishes to take him to the heavenly abode. Whereas the Āḻvār was hitherto seeking out the Lord and pursuing Him doggedly, the Lord is now in hot pursuit of the Āḻvār. In the exuberance of His love for the Āḻvār, the Lord would even think in terms of lifting him bodily to Heaven and seek the Saint’s permission therefor. How amazing and how incredible that the Sovereign Lord should seek the Āḻvār’s permission and want to play the subordinate role! Not finding any one else with whom the Āḻvār could share this wonderful experience of his, he opens up a dialogue with his own God- bent mind and gives vent to his hearty appreciation of the Lord’s tender solicitude and amazing simplicity, in this decad.

(10-7): From his present vantage position, the Āḻvār could prevail upon the Lord to give up His over-ambitious project of lifting the former up to Heaven, with this very body made up of the elements, the ‘prākṛtik’ nest. That the sovereign Lord should desist from putting through His cherished desire, purely in deference to the Āḻvār’s injunction, excites the Āḻvār’s admiration of the Lord’s amazing simplicity and tender solicitude, all the more. Literally lost in the contemplation of these extra-ordinary traits of the Lord, th‘e Āḻvār could regain his normal composure only after quite some time. Therefore it is, the Āḻvār warns like-minded poets, steeped in the enjoyment of the Lord’s auspicious traits, not to get involved in these enthralling traits of the Lord but just skip over them lest they should also get bogged down, as he did. The Lord, who exhibited such a great predilection for the Āḻvār’s physical frame, is depicted, *in the seventh decad*, as the One enshrined in Tirumāliruñcōlai (Tamiḻ Nāḍu). The Lord is said to have lavished on the Āḻvār’s material body, the aggregate of the love, borne by Him for the sacred centres of front-rank eminence like Mount Tirumāliruñcōlai, Mount Tiruvēṅkaṭam, the Milk-*ocean and* Sri Vaikunta, the High Heavens.

(10-8): With the stage, now well-set for his Heaven-bound journey, the Āḻvār accosts the Lord and seeks His explanation for His age-long indifference, allowing him to drift so long in this land of dark nescience, in dire contrast to His present hurry to put him in Heaven. The Āḻvār, however, quickly realises that the present dispensation of the Lord is but the influx of His spontaneous grace, totally unrelated to the merit in him. It is this voluntary grace of the Lord that the Āḻvār dwells upon, *in the eighth decad*, and rejoices.

(10-9): The Lord should have felt embarrassed by the rather inconvenient question put to Him by the Āḻvār, in the preceding decad. He, therefore, tried skilfully to tide over this unenviable situation, by bringing within the Āḻvār’s mental comprehension the entire panorama of his ascent to Heaven. The clouds and the oceans roared like an orchestra, heralding the Āḻvār’s ascent to Heaven and the inhabitants of all the seven islands, bestowed on him their choicest offerings. The sweet music and the fanfare of trumpets etc., from the land of the Kinnaras, Gandharvas and Garuḍas in the upper regions, hailing the Āḻvār’s ascent to Heaven, were made to fall on his ears; the chanks and bugles sounded all over, beautiful damsels with spear-shaped eyes sang in chorus the Āḻvār’s glory. The Maruth Gaṇas and Aṣṭa vasus kept chanting the laudatory hymns continually. The upward journey to Heaven through the exhilarating route, known as Arcirādi Gati, the propitiation of the Āḻvār by the Angels, *enroute*, the Āḻvār’s entry into Heaven and the grand ovation accorded to him by the denizens on the yonder side, his access to the gem-set hall, where Lord Mahāviṣṇu holds His ceremonial Durbar, duly conducted by the guides nominated for the purpose, and attainment of the Lord’s feet, all these were experienced mentally by the Āḻvār and voiced forth by him, *in the penultimate decad*, in an impersonal manner. He just depicts how, as a class, the devotees of the Supreme Lord, Śrīmān Nārāyaṇa are on their ascent to Heaven through this exalted route, exclusively ear-marked for them, greeted all along the route and received with special honours by the denizens of the upper regions, showering praises on the new-comers, so on and so forth.

(10-10): It was indeed a rude jolt to the Āḻvār, who was shocked into a sense of stark reality, when he opened his eyes and found that all that exhilarating experience, expatiated on, by him in the preceding decad, was a mere mental comprehension and nothing more. Eaten up by the cruel pangs of frustration at that he is still lingering in the unenviable mesh of ‘prakṛti’ (matter), the Āḻvār voices forth his deep yearning with the utmost effort, like the full-throated call for relief from one engulfed by wild fire. Weighed down by a gnawing sense of guilt, the merciful Lord of remarkable tenderness of heart, felt even more depressed than the Āḻvār himself. And so, the Lord and His Divine Consort rushed down, mounted on Garuḍa, flying at supersonic speed. The Lord cut out the Āḻvār’s material contacts, *in toto*, and led him to the transcendental abode (Śrī vaikuṇṭam). There, in the high Heaven, the ultimate destination of the yearning soul, the Āḻvār entered the august gathering of the great devotees of Lord Vaikuṇṭanātha and mingled freely with them, the joyous intercourse with the holy band in that exalted land, pined for by him since long, thus becoming an accomplished fact. According to the Āḻvār’s own admission in the penultimate song of *this concluding decad*, the Lord’s love for him outgrew his own and made it dwindle down to naught. The Āḻvār’s love progressed, by stages, as one can perceive, going through the entire gamut of this grand hymnal and currently, it has attained its full stature (Parama Bhakti), outstripping all else, assuming supra-cosmic proportions, even to the extent of enveloping the Lord Himself. The Lord, however, forestalled the Āḻvār, enveloped his ‘avā’ (deep love) and thereby held him, in His sweet embrace. In the concluding stanza of this decad, which is also the grand finale of this great hymnal, the Āḻvār gives vent to his sense of completion and fulfilment, saying that he has reached the ultimate destination, all the impediments having been eradicated, root and branch. Thus ends the ‘Avāvilantāti’, a special species of prosody, charged with ‘Bhakti’, in which the closing word of each song is the opening word of the next one.
