## 00 Intro1.7
Easy worshippability apart, the Lord should also be adorable.. We see around quite a few persons whom it is easy to please but we don’t like to court as there is nothing attractive or prepossessing in them. This decad shows that the Lord is highly adorable because of His extraordinary sweetness. As Nampiḷḷai would have it, the Lord is adorable to such an extent that He grows envious of His devotees and wants to adore them, in turn, having Himself tasted the sweetness of adoration. In śloka ‘manujatva tiroitena.........’ of Pādukā Sahaśram, Śrī Vedānta Deśika observes that, unlike the previous Avatāras when the Lord came all alone, He assumed four forms when He came down as Śrī Rāma and the three younger brothers. The purpose behind this was to adore His own pair of sandals which have a high reputation of their own. This He did in His other form as Bharata. Had Rāma come alone, He couldn’t have achieved this purpose.




## 1.7.1
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

பிறவித்துயர் அற ஞானத்துள் நின்று.  
துறவிச் சுடர் விளக்கம் தலைப்பெய்வார்,  
அறவனை ஆழிப்படை அந்தணனை,  
மறவியை இன்றி மனத்து வைப்பாரே.

piṟavittuyar aṟa ñāṉattuḷ niṉṟu.  
tuṟavic cuṭar viḷakkam talaippeyvār,  
aṟavaṉai āḻippaṭai antaṇaṉai,  
maṟaviyai iṉṟi maṉattu vaippārē.

**English translation of verse 1.7.1:**

(Oh, what a pity!) the Lord, gracious and immaculate, Sporting the effulgent discus, is tenaciously sought By those votaries wanting no more than to liberate Themselves from the miseries of birth and death and get lost in a state of ‘Self-enjoyment’ (of the Soul in its free state).

**Note**

Oh, what a pity! After ail the rigours of their disciplines, the ‘*Kevalas*’ rest contented with mere liberation from the cycle of birth and death, followed by⁴ ātmāvalokana’ (i.e.) enjoyment of their own selves in the disembodied state. The tragedy of it is heightened by the fact that they invoked the Lord’s grace for attaining this state but failed to be enthralled by His exquisite charm. The Āḻvār detests these people for this tragic failure resulting in their foregoing, for ever, the superior bliss of service unto the Lord. No doubt, in 1-5-7, the Āḻvār would appear to have had a word of praise for the ‘*Kevaḻas*’ but that was in a different context. It may be recalled that the Āḻvār, then stung by a gnawing apprehension of his abject lowliness, felt that possession of a body was fraught with the serious risk of his contaminating and defiling the Lord by mixing with Him and that a disembodied state of existence, as in the case of the ‘Kevalas would, therefore, be quite welcome, being the lesser of the two evils.




## 1.7.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வைப்பாம் மருந்து ஆம் அடியரை வல்வினைத்  
துப்பாம் புலன் ஐந்தும் துஞ்சக்கொடான் அவன்,  
எப்பால் எவர்க்கும் நலத்தால் உயர்ந்து உயர்ந்து,  
அப்பாலவன் எங்கள் ஆயர் கொழுந்தே.

vaippām maruntu ām aṭiyarai valviṉait  
tuppām pulaṉ aintum tuñcakkoṭāṉ avaṉ,  
eppāl evarkkum nalattāl uyarntu uyarntu,  
appālavaṉ eṅkaḷ āyar koḻuntē.

**English translation of verse 1.7.2:**

The Lord is, unto His devotees, the treasure fine  
And the unfailing drug; unto the senses five  
He shan’t make them succumb; of towering bliss,  
He’s above one and all, in all places,  
Beyond speech and thought and yet He’s (our Gopāla), the shepherd chief!

**Note**

Having decried and detested, in the preceding stanza, the ‘*Kevalas*’ seeking from the gracious Lord the inferior stature of *Kaivalya*, the Āḻvār now depicts the Lord in relation to those who seek Him as the goal, to the exclusion of everything else. Towering above all, beyond speech and comprehension, He still condescended to come down here as Gopālakṛṣṇa, of amazing simplicity.




## 1.7.3
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஆயர் கொழுந்தாய் அவரால் புடையுண்ணும்,  
மாயப் பிரானை என் மாணிக்கச் சோதியை,  
தூய அமுதைப் பருகிப் பருகி, என்-  
மாயப் பிறவி மயர்வு அறுத்தேனே.

āyar koḻuntāy avarāl puṭaiyuṇṇum,  
māyap pirāṉai eṉ māṇikkac cōtiyai,  
tūya amutaip parukip paruki, eṉ-  
māyap piṟavi mayarvu aṟuttēṉē.

**English translation of verse 1.7.3:**

I drank and drank, without intermission, the nectar pure,  
The dazzling gem, the mystic Lord of wondrous deeds,  
(Gopāla) the shepherd chief, bound and beaten by cowherds  
(For theft of butter) and got my nescience, matter-born, severed.

**Notes**

\(i\) Speaking about Gopālakṛṣṇa, in the last song, the Āḻvār had before him the entire panorama of His mysterious deeds and by merely meditating on them, he got all his accumulated nescience, born of age-long material contacts, eradicated in *toto*, root and branch.

\(ii\) In the by-gone days, the Devas got nectar subject to various conditions. Even so, it is by no means comparable to the Āḻvār’s uninhibited and unrestricted Divine experience, drinking deep of that pure nectar which cleansed him thoroughly and rooted out his age-long sins sheathed in ignorance.




## 1.7.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மயர்வு அற என் மனத்தே மன்னினான் தன்னை,  
உயர்வினையே தரும் ஒண் சுடர்க் கற்றையை,  
அயர்வு இல் அமரர்கள், ஆதிக் கொழுந்தை, என்  
இசைவினை என் சொல்லி யான் விடுவேனோ?

mayarvu aṟa eṉ maṉattē maṉṉiṉāṉ taṉṉai,  
uyarviṉaiyē tarum oṇ cuṭark kaṟṟaiyai,  
ayarvu il amararkaḷ, ātik koḻuntai, eṉ  
icaiviṉai eṉ colli yāṉ viṭuvēṉō?

**English translation of verse 1.7.4:**

Oh! what pretext can I find, from Him to part,  
The first Lord of Celestials ever alert,  
**A** beautiful bundle of brilliance, heaping on me continually,  
Torrents of knowledge and wisdom, who brought me  
Round and to root out my ignorance lodged in me firmly?

**Notes**

\(i\) In the preceding song, the Āḻvār acknowledged the Lord’s benevolence in rooting out all his ignorance. This is exactly what he had prayed for in his supplication to the Lord in the very first song of his first work (Tiruviruttam). Having achieved his purpose, can the Āḻvār now afford to forget the Lord? No, having removed all the vestiges of ignorance in the Āḻvār, the Lord continually resides in his mind, shutting out effectively the further growth of nescience in him. And what more? He is continually heaping upon the Āḻvār torrents of wisdom (Jñāna) and love (Bhakti). A beautiful bundle of brilliance, He is also the first Lord of the ‘Nitya Sūrīs’ (Eternal Heroes). How can the Āḻvār get himself divested of One, so great and so charming, ever inducing in him a passionate desire to be very close to Him? Thus, nothing is wanting on the Lord’s side to admit of a divorce from Him. If at all one wishes to throw odium on such a loving Lord, it can only be a sin-contrived dodge, like the one in the following anecdote:

\(ii\) A peasant boy who visited his father-in-law, was asked by the latter to help him to work a water-lift. The two of them started the work early in the morning and the boy who was high up on the lift, naturally felt tired when it was past mid-day. The father-in-law did not, however, have the courtesy to give the young son-in-law the much-needed relief. There upon, the latter, in sheer exasperation, spat on the back of the elder, just to provoke him. “How cool!” exclaimed the elder and went on with the work. The boy sharply jumped down, saying, “Better get hold of one who will spit on you hot!”




## 1.7.5
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

விடுவேனோ? என் விளக்கை என் ஆவியை,  
நடுவே வந்து உய்யக் கொள்கின்ற நாதனை,  
தொடுவே செய்து இள ஆய்ச்சியர் கண்ணினுள்,  
விடவே செய்து விழிக்கும் பிரானையே.

viṭuvēṉō? eṉ viḷakkai eṉ āviyai,  
naṭuvē vantu uyyak koḷkiṉṟa nātaṉai,  
toṭuvē ceytu iḷa āycciyar kaṇṇiṉuḷ,  
viṭavē ceytu viḻikkum pirāṉaiyē.

**English translation of verse 1.7.5:**

The amorous Lord who, by His sweet looks,  
Enticed away the young damsels (of Gokula)  
Is my Soul, the beacon light, Who unto me reveals  
All things; how can I from Him separation brook,  
My Saviour grand who did on me alight, all on a sudden?

**Note**

The damsels of Gokula would even spurn Heaven, but not give up the inseparable company of Śrī Kṛṣṇa. The Lord having enthralled the Āḻvār likewise, there is no question of his giving Him up.




## 1.7.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

பிரான் பெரு நிலம் கீண்டவன், பின்னும்  
விராய் மலர்த் துழாய் வேய்ந்த முடியன்,  
மராமரம் எய்த மாயவன், என்னுள்  
இரான் எனில் பின்னை யான் ஒட்டுவேனோ?

pirāṉ peru nilam kīṇṭavaṉ, piṉṉum  
virāy malart tuḻāy vēynta muṭiyaṉ,  
marāmaram eyta māyavaṉ, eṉṉuḷ  
irāṉ eṉil piṉṉai yāṉ oṭṭuvēṉō?

**English translation of verse 1.7.6:**

1 low can I at all survive, if the Benefactor great  
Who once retrieved the Earth from the ocean,  
On whose crown is the tulacī garland of aroma sweet,  
The wonder-Lord whose arrow sped thro’ the trees seven,  
Should desert me and stay not in my heart?

**Note**

This is the Āḻvār’s reply to a question supposed to have been put to him as to what he would do, in case the Lord forsook him once again. The Āḻvār rules out such a contingency, seeing that the Lord is a self-less Benefactor like Sandal paste, flower, southerly breeze and the Moon, catering to the happiness of others, seeking nothing in return. Surely, the Āḻvār would not be a willing party to the separation and he just can’t survive in such an eventuality. As a matter of fact, the Āḻvār cannot bring himself to believe that the Lord would at all leave him and go without his permission. Did He not, as Śrī Rāma, go even to the extent of clearing up the misgivings in the mind of Sugrīva about His ability to vanquish Vāli and infusing the requisite confidence? Could such a one desert the Āḻvār, who has firm faith in Him?




## 1.7.7
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

யான் ஒட்டி என்னுள் இருத்துவன் என்றிலன்,  
தான் ஒட்டி வந்து என் தனி நெஞ்சை வஞ்சித்து,  
ஊன் ஒட்டி நின்று என் உயிரில் கலந்து, இயல்  
வான் ஒட்டுமோ? இனி என்னை நெகிழ்க்கவே.

yāṉ oṭṭi eṉṉuḷ iruttuvaṉ eṉṟilaṉ,  
tāṉ oṭṭi vantu eṉ taṉi neñcai vañcittu,  
ūṉ oṭṭi niṉṟu eṉ uyiril kalantu, iyal  
vāṉ oṭṭumō? iṉi eṉṉai nekiḻkkavē.

**English translation of verse 1.7.7:**

In my mind I lodged Him not, on my own;  
Pledged to get in, the Lord did, on His own,  
Enter my mind imperious, unsought,  
Stuck avidly to my body and soul and wrought  
A silent change in me, drawing me unto Him, so well.  
To part from me hence, will such a One agree at all?

**Notes**

\(i\) The Lord entered the Āḻvār’s mind, pledged, as it were, to do so. This would show that the Āḻvār took no initiative in the matter. On the other hand, self-reliant and imperious that he was, he stood aloof, very much away from Him. But once a determined Lord took possession of the Āḻvār, the latter came under His magic spell, just like the miser who yielded to the resolute beggar, in the anecdote cited below.

\(ii\) There was a Brāhman who was an abject miser; another was on his way to this man’s house to get a breakfast. People on the way told the latter that the man he was going to, was the most sordid wretch who would not give food to any one. Undaunted, the beggar sought out the miser and begged for food, showing his great need. The miser was adamant in refusing food but ṭhe beggar would not leave him. The miser had to yield at last and when he asked the beggar to produce his eating plate, the latter opened his garment and showed it. The miser grumbled and exclaimed “He who intends cutting another’s throat, certainly brings ṭhe sword with him”. So saying, he couldn’t help handing over to the persevering, rather provoking beggar, a little bit of rice and sauce to get rid of him.




## 1.7.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

என்னை நெகிழ்க்கிலும் என்னுடை நன் நெஞ்சம்-  
தன்னை, அகல்விக்கத் தானும் கில்லான் இனி,  
பின்னை நெடும் பணைத் தோள் மகிழ் பீடு உடை,  
முன்னை அமரர் முழுமுதல் தானே.

eṉṉai nekiḻkkilum eṉṉuṭai naṉ neñcam-  
taṉṉai, akalvikkat tāṉum killāṉ iṉi,  
piṉṉai neṭum paṇait tōḷ makiḻ pīṭu uṭai,  
muṉṉai amarar muḻumutal tāṉē.

**English translation of verse 1.7.8:**

With his sinewy shoulders in Piṉṉai nestled,  
The joyous Lord Who unto the hoary Celestials  
Is all in all, cannot from Him separate, with all His might,  
My chastened mind, in Him entwined so well, albeit He.  
His grip on me, loosens and makes me stay apart.

**Note**

The Āḻvār avers that history will not repeat itself. Even if the Almighty Lord, in His unbridled independence, tried His utmost to keep the Āḻvār away, He wouldn’t succeed in putting aside his chastened mind, inseparably steeped in Him. This robust confidence has indeed the solid backing of Piṉṉai (Goddess Nappinna) the unfailing Intercessor through whose good offices the Āḻvār courted the Lord.




## 1.7.9
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அமரர் முழுமுதல் ஆகிய ஆதியை,  
அமரர்க்கு அமுது ஈந்த ஆயர் கொழுந்தை,  
அமர அழும்பத் துழாவி என் ஆவி,  
அமரத் தழுவிற்று இனி அகலும்மோ.

amarar muḻumutal ākiya ātiyai,  
amararkku amutu īnta āyar koḻuntai,  
amara aḻumpat tuḻāvi eṉ āvi,  
amarat taḻuviṟṟu iṉi akalummō.

**English translation of verse 1.7.9:**

The Primate Who unto Celestials is the fountain source  
Of all felicities, Who unto *Amarar* (Devas) delivered ambrosia,  
The Chief of the cowherds got into my soul, in tight embrace,  
With pleasure immense; Could He from me be apart anymore?

**Note**

Unto the Devas, who wanted ‘Amṛt’ (ambrosia), the mere extract from the ocean and not the Lord Himself, He gave the Amṛt; He, however, gave Himself to the Cowherds in whose midst He was born, because they wanted Him, the real ‘Amṛt’ and not that artificial stuff. The Āḻvār’s soul got steeped in Him to such an extent and in such a manner that the one couldn’t be told from the other and hence there was no question of separation, as if they were two different entities,




## 1.7.10
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அகலில் அகலும் அணுகில் அணுகும்,  
புகலும் அரியன் பொரு அல்லன் எம்மான்,  
நிகர் இல் அவன் புகழ் பாடி இளைப்பு இலம்,  
பகலும் இரவும் படிந்து குடைந்தே.

akalil akalum aṇukil aṇukum,  
pukalum ariyaṉ poru allaṉ emmāṉ,  
nikar il avaṉ pukaḻ pāṭi iḷaippu ilam,  
pakalum iravum paṭintu kuṭaintē.

**English translation of verse 1.7.10:**

Apart from them who from Him keep apart,  
Close to them who unto Him get close,  
Beyond approach (to the ungodly) but easy of access  
(To devotees); entranced do I sing His glory peerless,  
Day and night and never feel satiate.

**Note**

In the immense struggle between the Lord on the one side and the worldlings on the other, the latter, swayed by the stronger pull of earthly pleasures, stray away from Him. Indeed, the Lord grieves over this state of affairs. Unto those who seek Him exclusively, He responds so well that it is said, when man walks towards God, He runs towards him. When man ascends to the foot-stool of God, He enters the soul of man. Inexhaustible are His auspicious qualities and therefore it is that we can never reach the end and feel satiated in singing His praise.




## 1.7.11
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

குடைந்து வண்டு உண்ணும் துழாய் முடியானை,  
அடைந்த தென் குருகூர்ச் சடகோபன்,  
மிடைந்த சொல் தொடை ஆயிரத்து இப்பத்து,  
உடைந்து நோய்களை ஓடுவிக்குமே.

kuṭaintu vaṇṭu uṇṇum tuḻāy muṭiyāṉai,  
aṭainta teṉ kurukūrc caṭakōpaṉ,  
miṭainta col toṭai āyirattu ippattu,  
uṭaintu nōykaḷai ōṭuvikkumē.

**English translation of verse 1.7.11:**

These songs ten, out of the well-knit thousand.  
Composed by Caṭakōpaṉ of Teṉkurukūr, in worship bound  
To the Lord, wearing on His crown tulacī garland,  
Whose honey the swarming bees partake, will all our ill disband.
