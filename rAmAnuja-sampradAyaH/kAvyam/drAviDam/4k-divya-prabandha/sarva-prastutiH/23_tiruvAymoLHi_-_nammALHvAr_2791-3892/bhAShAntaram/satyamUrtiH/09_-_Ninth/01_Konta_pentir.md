## 00 Intro9.1
In the last decad (8-10), the Āḻvār had revealed to us the quintessence of his creed, namely, looking upon the Lord’s devotees as his ‘Be-all’ and ‘End-all ‘All-in-one the sole means for attaining ‘Mokṣa’ (Salvation). The Saint is further elaborating it, in this decad. in a manner highly delectable to the devotees, in whom he has taken refuge. The superficial reader might think that this decad strikes a note different from that of the immediately preceding decad inasmuch as the Āḻvār now looks upon the Lord as the aggregate of all conceivable kinship, one can claim. There is, however, no incompatibility between these two decads, the current one being but an elaboration of the theme, set out in the last decad. Even as ‘Bhagavad śeṣatva’, that is, service unto the Lord culminates in ‘Bhāgavata śeṣatva’, that is, service unto His devotees, the latter, in its natural sequence, steps into the domain of the former. It is indeed a matter of common knowledge that our love to a specified individual extends up to all those intimately connected with him or her. Likewise, love unto the godly men is automatically carried over to all those closely associated with them and the love so generated reverts to the Lord, as the one loved and revered by the devotees. In Śloka 51 of ‘Śrīguṇaratna Kośam’ of Śrī Parāśara Bhaṭṭar, the illustrious author declares his love unto Lord Raṅganātha, as one stemming from his being the Spouse of Goddess Śrī Raṅga Nāyakī (Śrī Mahālakṣmī). And then, reciprocally, the Upaniṣad reveals its predilection for the Divine Mother, in view of Her being the Consort of the Supreme Lord, the great Ordainer of the universe—‘Asyeśānā Jagato Viṣṇupatnī’? Surely, there is no contradiction between these two versions, as they are mutually inclusive and not exclusive.

This decad copiously illustrates, in a telling manner, the utter futility of our hanging on to the earthly relations and all else except the Supreme Lord. Who alone is our Eternal Saviour and Sole Sustainer, under all circumstances. The miserable hollowness of the ephemeral bonds of the earthly relations and associates, the veritable parasites, is exposed in all its nakedness. Actually, this is but an elaboration of what the Āḻvār had already stated in V-1-8, wherein he pointed out that the Lord is the sum-total of all the happiness derived by the worldly men through glittering wealth, dazzling damsels, dutiful sons, doting parents and so on. It is this decad that set the pace for the great Piḻḻai Lokācāryā’s theme that none but the Lord is our Protector, set out in aphorism 39 of Mumukṣuppaḍi and further elaborated by him, in his esoteric treatise, known as ‘Prapanna Paṛtrāṇam’.

This decad is deemed to be in benedictive adoration of Mathurā, in Uttara Pradesh, in view of the frequent reference, in this decad, to that holy centre.




## 9.1.1
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

**English translation of verse 9.1.1:**

Neither the wife by you acquired nor the sons unto you born  
Nor your other relations and friends shall for you entertain  
Love other than that rooted in lucre; lies indeed your salvation  
In being the vassal of the Benefactor great, Who gulped down  
Things, one and all, that lay in all the ten directions.

**Notes:**

\(i\) Addressing the men of this world, the Saint impresses upon them that they need hardly deceive themselves by lavishing their misplaced affections on the earthly relations, who are not of real consequence and that they will do well to lean, instead, on the Supreme Lord, in view of the inviolable, eternal bond between them and Him. The Āḻvār does not mince matters and points out that one’s wife and children are but goods purchased. So much of the man’s heart twines round these goods that he would not mind turning his aged parents out, into the streets, in beggar’s rags.

Regarding the acquisition of a wife, the following story, related by an eminent discourser, is indeed very interesting and instructive:

A brahmin youth ran about here and there, begging for money with which he could buy a wife. In the course of his wanderings, he reached a big city, where, unfortunately, he fell seriously ill. He had, no doubt, collected a few hundreds of rupees which served to boost up his hopes of soon getting a lady to his side. But the sickness gained ground and the poor fellow was on his death-bed, writhing in agony. When the sympathetic neighbours gathered round him and enquired of him what ailed him, he cried out: “What a pity! 1 have not been blessed with a beautiful young woman, draped in finery, standing by my pillow and cooling my burning brow with her sweet tears, at this dying moment.”

\(ii\) That the Lord is our Eternal Relation and unfailing Protector is brought out by the manner in which He sustained, unasked and unsolicited, all things and beings, in His stomach, during the Deluge, so that they may not be swept off by the terrific waters. Our salvation, sure and certain, therefore, lies in the recognition of our essential nature, namely, being at the sole disposal of the Supreme Lord, as His exclusive vassal.




## 9.1.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

துணையும் சார்வும்ஆகுவார்போல் சுற்றத்தவர்பிறரும்  
அணையவந்த ஆக்கம்உண்டேல் அட்டைகள்போல் சுவைப்பர்  
கணைஒன்றாலே ஏழ்மரமும் எய்த எம்கார்முகிலைப்

kaṇaioṉṟālē ēḻmaramum eyta emkārmukilaip  
puṇaieṉṟuuyyap pōkalallāl illaikaṇṭīrporuḷē.

**English translation of verse 9.1.2:**

The earthly kinsmen and others are after your money and yet pretend  
To be your benefactors, safe and sincere, and you they befriend  
Only to suck you out like leeches as long as they choose;  
Better take refuge in our cloud-hued Lord, Who did pierce  
With but a single shaft the trees seven; ‘tis no use,  
Take note, pinning your faith on others.

**Notes:**

\(i\) (The earthly relations flock, in strength, to those enjoying wealth and opulence, just to grab whatever they can. These are veritable parasites, putting on the garb of well-wishers and benefactors and are least dependable. On the other hand, the Lord succours even those who are sceptical and entertain doubts about His strength and dispensation. Sugrīva’s attitude towards Lord Rāma, even after He had promised to relieve the distress of the former by slaying Vali, the powerful monkey king, is the pointer. Sugrīva’s doubts about Śrī Rāma’s ability to vanquish the formidable Vāli were dispelled only after He ably demonstrated His strength and skill by (1) Kicking off, to an enormous distance, the skeleton of Dundubi, the Rākṣasa, slain by Vāli, after a long and grim struggle and (2) sending a powerful shaft which pierced the Seven *Sāl* trees and the seven worlds beyond and ultimately returned to the Lord’s quiver, as proof-positive of His enormous strength, more than a match indeed for Vāli, despite the latter’s colossal strength. It should also be noted that the Lord seeks nothing in return, like unto the benevolent rain-clouds unleashing water all over. Therefore it is, He is referred to here, as the cloud-hued.

\(ii\) Again, look at the multifarious ways in which Lord Kṛṣṇa stood beside the Pandavas and Droupati, through thick and thin and protected them at every turn. The lesson to be learnt, from all these, is that the Lord is our sole support and leaning on Him is always productive of immense good while dependence on others can only breed miseries.




## 9.1.3

aruḷkoḷ āḷāy uyyalallāl illaikaṇṭīraraṇē.

**English translation of verse 9.1.3:**

When men behold money in your hands, you they hail and court  
And secure one thing or the other ere from you they depart;  
However, none in pity will unto you come  
When chill penury casts on you its terrific gloom;  
There’s indeed no other way for your salvation  
Except the grace of the Lord Who, in North Maturai, was born  
To quell the Asuras, who did on all inflict pain.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The worldly men are essentially selfish and they befriend only those who possess money and lavish praises on them. The latter easily succumb to these sycophants and are misled into believing that they are all genuine well-wishers, with no personal ends in view. The confidence-tricksters will then have no hesitation in fleecing the wealthy men, cheating them, right and left, all the time, and deserting them altogether, once their money is drained off.

\(ii\) It is with supercilious disdain that the world looks on poverty. Piḷḷai Tirunaraiyūr Araiyar used to relate thus: A man grew rich with the help of a friend who, however, became poor in the process. The latter invited the former for dinner, on a certain occasion. The rich man would not, however, condescend to respond nor even care to enquire of the welfare of the poor man, lest, by doing so, he might (1) suffer in the estimation of the world, as having kinship with a poor man and (2) let the poor man rise in the estimation of the world, as one favoured by a rich friend. In dire contrast to this, the supreme Lord readily responds to the call of the destitute. All that one needs to do is to invoke His redemptive grace and not to shrink away from it, as and when it descends. It is, therefore, no use hankering after lesser persons, for protection; by doing so, one would be asking for trouble, like unto the little babe wanting to touch fire, mistaking it for a red seed (used for weighment of Gold).




## 9.1.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அரணம்ஆவர் அற்றகாலைக்கு என்றென்று அமைக்கப்பட்டார்  
இரணம்கொண்ட தெப்பர்ஆவர் இன்றியிட்டாலும் அஃதே

caraṇeṉṟuuyyap pōkalallāl illaikaṇṭīr catirē.

**English translation of verse 9.1.4:**

The men we court and pamper, after reflection deep,  
As our certain saviours, in times of dire need,  
Are helpless themselves and will thus betray us indeed;  
’Tis no use talking about these ungratefuls, we will do well instead,  
To turn our thougpts on the glory great of the One,  
In North Maturai born, for our salvation lies therein alone.

**Notes:**

\(i\) Even those, who are currently well off, apprehend the possibility of lean days overtaking them and, therefore, lean, right from now, on some one in whom they have great confidence. But that very person, looked upon as their prospective saviour and pampered heavily, miserably lets them down, at the crucial moment. In Taittirīya Saṃhitā, First Kāṇḍa, fifth praśna, it is said that, in an encounter with the Asuras, the Devas once attained victory. Apprehending, however, the probability of their suffering defeat, in their next encounter with the Asuras, the Devas deposited with ‘Agni’ (Fire-God) their choicest wealth, as a stand-by, to fall back upon, during those dark days of defeat. The Fire-God, however, appropriated all that wealth unto himself and deserted them. Actually, those persons who are chosen as our prospective guardians and unto whom we entrust all our precious hoardings, knock them off, as if it was but a repayment of the debt we owed them earlier. Even assuming that the person, in whom we pin such a robust faith, is one of great integrity and, therefore, highly dependable, it is just possible that he suddenly passes away and leaves us in the lurch, at the crucial moment, dreaded by us so much.

\(ii\) Did not Śrī Rāma chide Lakṣmaṇa that the latter would do well to recount Bharatā’s greatness, any length of time, much to his (Rāma’s) delectation but desist from indulging in a tirade against Kaikeyi? Even so, the Āḻvār says that we will do well to meditate on the great qualities of the Lord, instead of wasting our breath in denouncing the ungrateful men of the world. There is no greater good than such sweet contemplation of the Lord, who bestows on us, the eternal reward of Heaven for the mere submission of ours to Him, “I belong to You, I am Yours”. On the other hand, the result achieved by hanging on to others will hardly be commensurate with the effort put in by the supplicant.




## 9.1.5
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

சதுரம்என்று தம்மைத்தாமே சம்மதித்து இன்மொழியார்  
மதுரபோகம் துற்றவரே வைகிமற்றுஒன்றுஉறுவர்  
அதிர்கொள்செய்கை அசுரர்மங்க வடமதுரைப்பிறந்தாற்கு

atirkoḷceykai acurarmaṅka vaṭamaturaippiṟantāṟku  
etirkoḷāḷāy uyyalallāl illaikaṇṭīr iṉpamē.

**English translation of verse 9.1.5:**

Alas! they that did of their ability boast and revel  
In dalliance with the sweet-tongued damsels,  
Will some time be by them put to shame and ridicule;  
There’s no greater bliss indeed than being the loving vassal  
Of the Lord Who, in North Maturai, was born to quell  
The fell Asuras who did perpetrate deeds abominable.

**Notes:**

\(i\) With their youthful vigour and wealth drained off, the erstwhile heroes, the dynamic centre of attraction for the voluptuous women of rare beauty, fade out miserably. And yet, these men try, in vain, to trade on their past reputation and are beaten back and unrelentingly repelled by those very women on whom they had lavished their love and lucre. The necessity for alluding to the inconstancy of these base women arises from the fact that, in this decad, the Āḻvār not only impresses the need for our giving up dependence on all our earthly relations and clinging to the Lord instead, but also brings home the grim truth that the world is steeped in ingratitude and is thus prone to spurn the erstwhile donors and benefactors. All these lead to the logical compulsion of our pinning our faith solely in Him, Who will stand by us, under all circumstances and salve us. The bliss, derived from God-love, is not only far superior to that sought in the company of the fair ladies but also everlasting.

\(ii\) As Nampiḷḷai puts it, all that we have to do to win the love of God is not to repel the influx of His sweet grace, as and when it descends on us. On hearing that Śrī Kṛṣṇa would be visiting Hastinapur [Hastinapura] shortly, as an emissary of the Pāṇḍavas, King Dhṛtarāṣṭra did some loud thinking, as follows: “Kṛṣṇa, the partisan of the Pāṇḍavas will be going over here shortly, to mediate on their behalf. Let us try to square him up, by giving him land and gold.” The pious Sañjaya, however, cut to size the hapless old king and disabused him of his wrong notions about Lord Kṛṣṇa, by saying: “All that Kṛṣṇa would need and care for is the simple courtesy normally extended to an ordinary sojourner, namely, cool water for washing the weary feet and kind words of enquiry. Anything else, you might like to offer Him. should be out of an innate love for Him and not by way of winning Him over; in the latter case, He would just spurn it all”.

\(iii\) The so-called earthly pleasures are always tinged with sorrow, like unto a man right on the gallows, about to be hanged, quenching his thirst and feeling satisfied or like shelter from the gruelling heat of the Sun, in the shade cast by the outstretched hood of an infuriated cobra. On the other hand, the bliss enjoyed, in the service of the Supreme Lord, is unalloyed, an end in itself, fraught with felicity.




## 9.1.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

இல்லைகண்டீர் இன்பம்அந்தோ! உள்ளது நினையாதே  
தொல்லையார்கள் எத்தனைவர் தோன்றிக் கழிந்தொழிந்தார்?  
மல்லை மூதூர் வடமதுரைப்பிறந்தவன் வண்புகழே

colliuyyap pōkalallāl maṟṟoṉṟuillaicurukkē.

**English translation of verse 9.1.6:**

Many men of yore had just come and gone,  
Oblivious of the true goal eternal, alas! happiness there’s none,  
In this world, take note; lies indeed our salvation  
In singing the glory great of the Lord, Who was born  
In North Maturai, rich and hoary; this is the truth plain.  
Which, in no other way, one can explain.

**Notes:**

The Āḻvār deplores the fate of myriads of men who have come into this world and passed out, without realising the eternal values of life and the everlasting happiness resulting therefrom. What a pity! these men failed to discover that there is no real happiness over here and that the Supreme Lord alone can bestow real and lasting happiness through our loving and intimate service unto Him.

The Saint, therefore, exhorts the men of the contemporary world not to follow in the footsteps of those men of the past and get bogged down, but attain salvation by singing the great glory of Lord Kṛṣṇa who was born in North Mathura—the holy city, hallowed by the advent of Lord Vāmana and Lord Kṛṣṇa and by virtue of its having been the capital of Śatrughna, the Youngest brother of Śrī Rāma.




## 9.1.7
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மற்றொன்றுஇல்லை சுருங்கச்சொன்னோம் மாநிலத்துஎவ்உயிர்க்கும்

kuṟṟamilcīr kaṟṟuvaikal vāḻtalkaṇṭīrkuṇamē.

**English translation of verse 9.1.7:**

Let me, in brief, tell ye, men of this sprawling world!  
There’s no means for your salvation except to learn and abide  
In contemplation of the flawless traits of Kṛṣṇa, our Lord,  
Who, in North Maturai, was born;’tis indeed meritorious  
And would suffice, no need there is for practices, tiresome and tedious.

**Notes:**

The Āḻvār now expounds the easy worshippabiḷity of the Lord and the sweetness that flows from worshipping Him. All those, in this abode of ours, surrounded by the oceanic waters, are eligible to partake of the Āḻvār’s advice and reap the rich reward. The importance of looking upon the Lord as the ‘Ready Means’ (siddhopāya), the Means and the End combined, is being emphasised here, when the Āḻvār asks the people to desist from any other path of discipline, entailing tedious ritualistic observances. As true knowledge of the inter-relation between Man and God will, by itself, lead to salvation (Jñānān Mokṣaḥ), mere mental awareness of the Lord’s role as our sole Benefactor, with an inherent obligation to protect His feeble subjects at this end, will suffice. But then, it might be asked whether it would be faulty, rather superfluous, to sing the Lord’s glory, as enjoined in this song. No, it is not at all faulty insofar as this laudation is an end in itself and not done as a means for attaining Him, in a spirit of bargaining.

The Saint exhorts the temporal beings to do nothing more than recite the Lord’s names, which calls for no special effort, entailing fatigue. It may be recalled, in this context, how that great God-lover, Prahlāda invited his school-mates to ejaculate God’s names effortlessly, as follows:

> “Oh, Lord Supreme,” by morn, “Oh, Kṛṣṇa,”, at noon and “Oh, Govindā,”,
> in the evening.




## 9.1.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வாழ்தல்கண்டீர் குணம்இது அந்தோ! மாயவன் அடிபரவிப்

வாழ்துணையா வடமதுரைப்பிறந்தவன் வண்புகழே

vīḻtuṇaiyāp pōmitaṉil yātumillaimikkatē.

**English translation of verse 9.1.8:**

Alas! how ignorant of the art of living are men indeed!  
No greater felicity there is unto the blemishless ones that think  
Of living, in the real sense, than lovingly meditate and sing  
The glory great of the One, born in North Maturai, the wondrous Lord.

**Notes:**

\(i\) This is one of the several stanzas of the ‘Divya Prabandhas’ that lend support to Saint Rāmānuja’s elucidation, in the ‘Antarādhikaraṇa’ of his Śrī Bhāṣya, of the main purpose of the Lord’s incarnations. Although the triple functions of succouring the Saintly, vanquishing the wicked and re-establishment of the moral order of things could have as well been achieved by the mere ‘Saṅkalpa’ (resolve) of the Omnipotent Lord, the first part, namely, protection of the pious ones couldn’t have been put through effectively, except by the Lord’s actual descent into their midst. The great qualities of head and heart, freely displayed by the Lord during His Avatārs, sustain the Godly men down the ages, immersed in the sweet contemplation thereof, long after the Avatār was concluded and the Lord returned to the Celestium. This, in essence, is what ‘Sādhu paritrāṇam’ (protection of the pious ones) does connote. The age-long sins of appalling magnitude can get liquidated only through the contemplation of the Lord’s auspicious traits and wondrous deeds.

\(ii\) The great Nampiḷḷai puts it that the Āḻvār deplores the callous indifference of the worldly men whom he has to invite, rather beg, to drink deep of the great delicacy that the Lord is, like unto hiring out people to come and taste the sweet sugarcane.

\(iii\) “The blemishless ones”, mentioned in this song, are those who abide in the Lord, all the time, reading and writing about Him, listening to the pious ones and talking to them, resulting in mutual enlightenment and entertainment. This is in contradistinction to those who employ the reading, writing and talking about the Lord’s great glory, as a means for eking out their material existence in luxurious style, literally pawning away God for the enjoyment of worldly pleasures and earning their livelihood, as Parāśara Bhaṭṭārya would say.




## 9.1.9
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

யாதும்இல்லை மிக்குஅதனில் என்றுஎன்று அதுகருதி  
காதுசெய்வான் கூதைசெய்து கடைமுறை வாழ்க்கையும்போம்  
மாதுகிலின் கொடிக்கொள்மாட வடமதுரைப்பிறந்த  
தாதுசேர்தோள் கண்ணன் அல்லால் இல்லை கண்டீர் சரணே.

mātukiliṉ koṭikkoḷmāṭa vaṭamaturaippiṟanta  
tātucērtōḷ kaṇṇaṉ allāl illai kaṇṭīr caraṇē.

**English translation of verse 9.1.9:**

Things mundane, one might deem quite often,  
As the goal supreme, but alas! it would dwindle down,  
Like unto earlobes, disfigured with holes wide open,  
By those seeking to decorate them; haven there’s none  
But Kaṇṇaṉ, whose shoulders are bedecked with garlands fine,  
Who, in North Maturai, with banners atop the castles, was born.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The Saint warns those seeking protection in any one other than the Supreme Lord, that they are in for deterioration, instead of going up the scale and that they would, in the bargain, get dislodged even from the old order of things. These men will, therefore, do well to seek refuge in the Supreme Lord, the unfailing Protector. This position is brought home vividly by citing the example of those, with charming ear-lobes, disfiguring them in the name of decorating themselves with gold ear-rings by piercing therein elongated holes. In his unique diction, Nampiḷḷai, the great glossator, puts it that even the so-called enjoyment of family life, bristling with progeny and the resultant din and tussle, will decline, when people seek the protection of any other than the Supreme Lord who, as Lord Kṛṣṇa, was born in North Mathura; they will thus be in an unenviable position, neither here nor there.

\(ii\) Yet another interpretation of this song, given in the commentary of Tirukkurukaippirāṉ Piḷḷāṉ, is as follows: Those that endeavour to attain ‘Kaivalya mokṣa ‘(i.e.) enjoyment of the Self, in its disembodied state, freed from the cycle of birth and death, treating it as the Supreme goal, instead of God-enjoyment, stand to lose even the ḷittḻe enjoyment they had in family life. The analogy of disfiguring the ear-lobes, in the name of decorating them, holds good here also.




## 9.1.10
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கண்ணன் அல்லால் இல்லைகண்டீர் சரண்அதுநிற்கவந்து

**English translation of verse 9.1.10:**

The Lord was in North Maturai born as Kaṇṇaṉ,  
To establish the truth that none but He is our haven sure  
And to rid Mother Earth of her terrific burden;  
You and what yours you deem, at His feet do offer  
And salvation attain; there‘s no need to waver,  
For there’s hardly a thing that unto Him doesn’t belong.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The Gītā Śloka, “Paritrāṇāya Sādhūnām......” has been interpreted by our Ācāryas differently, at different places, but it should not be misconstrued that they are at variance with one another. Actually, these are the different facets of the central theme, namely, the Lord is the ‘Ready Means’ (Siddhopāya) around whom revolves the triple functions of His Avatāras, namely, *Sustenance of the Righteous, suppression of the unrighteous* and *stabilisation of the moral order of things*. Saint Rāmānuja has held that the sole purpose of the Lord’s advent on Earth is to succour the ‘Sādhus’ (Godly men), relegating the other two components to a secondary place, as they could as well be achieved by the Lord’s mere resolve, thus dispensing with the need for His incarnation. But then, there is an aphorism in ‘Śrīvacana Bhūṣaṇam’ which quotes Nañcīyar, as attributing the herculean tasks performed by the Lord during His Avatāras to His intolerance of the insults by the wicked ones on His devotees. In the eighth song of this very decad, ‘Sādhu paritrāṇam’ was emphasised as the main purpose of the Lord’s Avatāras. In this song, however, ridding the Earth of its unwholesome burden (destroying the wicked) has been adduced as the purpose of the Lord’s advent as Śrī Kṛṣṇa. This brings into focus the aspect of extinction of the wicked ones. Actually, this aspect is but a natural corollary to ‘Sādhu paritrāṇam which comprises both the fulfilment of the thing, wished for. and elimination of the obnoxious. Further, the third aspect of the Avatāra is re-establishment of the moral order of things, which had declined alarmingly, prior to the Lord’s advent. But the Lord, Whose purpose it was to resuscitate ‘Dharma’ and put it back on stable footing, did call upon Arjuna to give up altogether the pursuit of Dharma (Gita XVIII.66). This adds a new dimension to the Lord’s purpose of setting up ‘Dharma’. What He is after is to make us pin all our faith in Him, the ‘Siddha Dharma’, ‘Kṛṣṇam dharmaṃ sanātanam’, ‘Rāmo Vigrahavān dharmaḥ’.

\(ii\) There’s no need to waver, in regard to the submission unto the Lord of yourself and your so-called possessions, whether a particular thing belongs to you or to Him. There is hardly a thing which does not vest in Him, which you can call your own.

**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கண்ணன் அல்லால் இல்லைகண்டீர் சரண்அதுநிற்கவந்து  
மண்ணின் பாரம் நீக்குதற்கே வடமதுரைப்பிறந்தான்  
திண்ணமாநும் உடைமை உண்டேல் அவன்அடி சேர்த்துஉய்ம்மினோ  
எண்ணவேண்டா நும்மதுஆதும் அவன்அன்றிமற்றுஇல்லையே.

kaṇṇaṉ allāl illaikaṇṭīr caraṇatuniṟkavantu  
maṇṇiṉ pāram nīkkutaṟkē vaṭamaturaippiṟantāṉ  
tiṇṇamānum uṭaimai uṇṭēl avaṉaṭi cērttuuymmiṉō  
eṇṇavēṇṭā nummatuātum avaṉaṉṟimaṟṟuillaiyē.

**English translation of verse 9.1.10:**

The Lord was in North Maturai born as Kaṇṇaṉ,  
To establish the truth that none but He is our haven sure  
And to rid Mother Earth of her terrific burden;  
You and what yours you deem, at His feet do offer  
And salvation attain; there‘s no need to waver,  
For there’s hardly a thing that unto Him doesn’t belong.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The Gītā Śloka, “Paritrāṇāya Sādhūnām......” has been interpreted by our Ācāryas differently, at different places, but it should not be misconstrued that they are at variance with one another. Actually, these are the different facets of the central theme, namely, the Lord is the ‘Ready Means’ (Siddhopāya) around whom revolves the triple functions of His Avatāras, namely, *Sustenance of the Righteous, suppression of the unrighteous* and *stabilisation of the moral order of things*. Saint Rāmānuja has held that the sole purpose of the Lord’s advent on Earth is to succour the ‘Sādhus’ (Godly men), relegating the other two components to a secondary place, as they could as well be achieved by the Lord’s mere resolve, thus dispensing with the need for His incarnation. But then, there is an aphorism in ‘Śrīvacana Bhūṣaṇam’ which quotes Nañcīyar, as attributing the herculean tasks performed by the Lord during His Avatāras to His intolerance of the insults by the wicked ones on His devotees. In the eighth song of this very decad, ‘Sādhu paritrāṇam’ was emphasised as the main purpose of the Lord’s Avatāras. In this song, however, ridding the Earth of its unwholesome burden (destroying the wicked) has been adduced as the purpose of the Lord’s advent as Śrī Kṛṣṇa. This brings into focus the aspect of extinction of the wicked ones. Actually, this aspect is but a natural corollary to ‘Sādhu paritrāṇam which comprises both the fulfilment of the thing, wished for. and elimination of the obnoxious. Further, the third aspect of the Avatāra is re-establishment of the moral order of things, which had declined alarmingly, prior to the Lord’s advent. But the Lord, Whose purpose it was to resuscitate ‘Dharma’ and put it back on stable footing, did call upon Arjuna to give up altogether the pursuit of Dharma (Gita XVIII.66). This adds a new dimension to the Lord’s purpose of setting up ‘Dharma’. What He is after is to make us pin all our faith in Him, the ‘Siddha Dharma’, ‘Kṛṣṇam dharmaṃ sanātanam’, ‘Rāmo Vigrahavān dharmaḥ’.

**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஆதும்இல்லை மற்றுஅவனில் என்றுஅதுவே துணிந்து  
தாதுசேர்தோள் கண்ணனைக் குருகூர்ச்சடகோபன்சொன்ன  
தீதுஇலாத ஒண்தமிழ்கள் இவைஆயிரத்துள் இப்பத்தும்  
ஓதவல்லபிராக்கள் நம்மை ஆளுடையார்கள் பண்டே. (2)

ōtavallapirākkaḷ nammai āḷuṭaiyārkaḷ paṇṭē. (2)

**English translation of verse 9.1.11:**

The benefactors great, well-versed in these songs ten,  
Out of the impeccable thousand, in chaste Tamil, of Caṭakōpaṉ  
Of Kurukūr, Who did his unflinching faith pin  
Solely on Lord Kaṇṇan, with garland bedecked,  
Are unto him and others of his ilk Masters, since long back.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The great ones, who learn and chant this decad, are said \\to attract unto them, as their vassals, the Lord’s devotees like the Āḻvār, right from the moment these chanters acquired the physical frames which eventually led them on to the study and recital of this decad.

\(ii\) It is the Āḻvār’s firm faith in the Supreme Lord, as the ‘Means’ and the ‘End’, that manifested itself as this d cad, where he declares that Lord Kṛṣṇa is all. This robust faith in Him was, in turn, induced by the Lord’s exquisite Form, His sinewy shoulders sporting the lovely tuḷaci garland.

\(iii\) The impeccability of this hymnal has already been stressed upon, in several places. Unlike Rāmāyaṇa and Mahābhārata, which introduce several extraneous matters as well, Tiruvāymoḻi dwells exclusively on the Supreme Lord.
