## 00 Intro2.6
As set out, in the last decad, the Āḻvār is experiencing the Supreme bliss of Union with the Lord, like Heaven transplanted right here. And what about the Lord? In the supreme joy of His union with the Āḻvār, the Lord, is exploring new avenues of regaling him as well as those associated with him. What a fine reciprocity?

In II-3, the Āḻvār pined, for the company of the Lord’s devotees and now the Lord’s love for the Āḻvār extends to his devotees as well. But at the same time. He also apprehends the possibility of the Āḻvār slipping back to his old ways and shrinking away from Him, overwhelmed by His transcendent glory. The Āḻvār feels the Lord’s pulse all right and hastens to assure Him that he would not give up his Lord on any account and that his present grip on Him is very tight indeed.

Śrī Nampiḷḷai likens the Lord’s apprehension, referred to above, to Śrī Rāma’s apprehension whether the extremely happy days, he and Śīta [Sītā] had in Citrakūṭ [Citrakūṭa] in each other’s delightful company, would at all go on for all time, being too good to last long.




## 2.6.1
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வைகுந்தா மணிவண்ணனே என் பொல்லாத் திருக்குறளா என்னுள் மன்னி,  
வைகும் வைகல் தோறும் அமுது ஆய வான் ஏறே,  
செய் குந்தா அரும் தீமை உன் அடியார்க்குத் தீர்த்து அசுரர்க்குத் தீமைகள்-  
செய் குந்தா உன்னை நான் பிடித்தேன் கொள் சிக்கெனவே..

vaikuntā maṇivaṇṇaṉē eṉ pollāt tirukkuṟaḷā eṉṉuḷ maṉṉi,  
vaikum vaikal tōṟum amutu āya vāṉ ēṟē,  
cey kuntā arum tīmai uṉ aṭiyārkkut tīrttu acurarkkut tīmaikaḷ-  
cey kuntā uṉṉai nāṉ piṭittēṉ koḷ cikkeṉavē..

**English translation of verse 2.6.1:**

Of sapphire hue, oh, Vaikunta! (Lord of Heaven)  
My lovely midget (Vāmana)! in my heart, steadfast you remain.  
Oh, Chief of celestials! unto me You are nectarean,  
Every fleeting moment; You redeem Your devotees’ dire sins  
And to the Acuras You just pass them on.  
Kuntā (Immaculate Lord)! firm unto You I hold on, please note.

**Notes**

\(i\) In the last decad, even while enjoying the bliss of the Lord’s union with him, the Āḻvār referred to himself as worthless (2-5-5) and as being lowly without limit, even as there is no limit to the Lord’s greatness (2-5-8). Naturally, expressions such as these roused the suspicion of the Lord that the Āḻvār, whose company He covets so much, might once again be caught up in a vein of abject humility and want to run away from Him. But the Āḻvār assures an agitated Lord that He could trust him, when he says that he won’t think of leaving Him at all. Here is a picture, in the reverse order, if one recalls a similar assurance held out by Lord Kṛṣṇa to an agitated Arjuna. (Gītā XVIII-66).

\(ii\) Reference to Vāmana, in the second line of this stanza, is given a beautiful turn by Nampiḷḷai. Vāmana Mūrti’s charming personality and wonderful comportment, baffling description, were lost on all else except the Āḻvār, who was enthralled by these qualities of the Lord and could get Him lodged in his heart. This was indeed a great loss to Indra, who was mindful of his only gain merely, the return of his lost kingdom and to Mahābali, whose only concern was to maintain his reputation as a great donor. There was absolutely no question of the others then on the scene, the ungodly Śukrācārya, who was made to lose his eye, and Namuṣi, who was hurled, high up in the sky, having been attracted by Vāmana’s enthralling charm. The sole beneficiary is, therefore, Nammāḻvār, in whom such a charming Lord now stands enshrined.

\(iii\) The grip of the Āḻvār on the Lord is said to be so tight that even the Lord cannot shake him off, if He wished to do so.




## 2.6.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

சிக்கெனச் சிறிது ஓர் இடமும் புறப்படாத் தன்னுள்ளே, உலகுகள்  
ஒக்கவே விழுங்கிப் புகுந்தான் புகுந்ததற்பின்,  
மிக்க ஞான வெள்ளச் சுடர் விளக்குஆய் துளக்கு அற்று அமுதம் ஆய், எங்கும்  
பக்கம் நோக்கு அறியான் என் பைந்தாமரைக் கண்ணனே.

cikkeṉac ciṟitu ōr iṭamum puṟappaṭāt taṉṉuḷḷē, ulakukaḷ  
okkavē viḻuṅkip pukuntāṉ pukuntataṟpiṉ,  
mikka ñāṉa veḷḷac cuṭar viḷakkuāy tuḷakku aṟṟu amutam āy, eṅkum  
pakkam nōkku aṟiyāṉ eṉ paintāmaraik kaṇṇaṉē.

**English translation of verse 2.6.2:**

With all the worlds in His stomach, neatly compressed  
(And all His regal duties, duly disposed)  
The resolute Lord has got inside me and thus transposed,  
His radiant Knowledge, in spate, shines forth like the lamp bright;  
Feeling firm and secure, with the assurance from me got,  
My nectar, the lotus-eyed Lord, sees not This side or that (and is in me so rapt).

**Notes**

\(i\) In the original text of this stanza, mention has been made of the Lord having gulped down all the worlds and kept them secure in His stomach, before entering the Āḻvār’s body. What the poet intends to say is that the Lord attended not only to this particular duty but all His other regal duties, as well, so that, once He enters the Āḻvār’s body, His rapport with the Āḻvār may go on undisturbed, unlike the worshipper, ostensibly in front of the Deity in the Sanctum Sanctorum, but anxious, all the time, about the safety of the pair of new Sandals, left by him at the temple gate.

\(ii\) The Knowledge of the Omniscient Lord is said to have acquired new dimensions after His entering the Āḻvār’s body and thus shines with extra brilliance.

And then, so completely rapt and engrossed with the Āḻvār is the Lord that He wouldn’t turn His attention elsewhere, not even when Lakṣmī, the Lord’s favourite spouse, puts her fair arms round His neck and draws Him extremely close to her breast. The following anecdote is very apt and can easily drive home the point.

\(iii\) On being informed by his preceptor, Maṇakkāl Nampi (Śrī Rāma Miśra), that one Kurukaikkāval Appaṉ had a Yogic secret to communicate, Āḷavantār (Yāmuna) journeyed all the way to Kaṅkaikoṇṭa-Cōḻapuram, to meet the said Yogi. As Appaṉ was seated, deeply engrossed in Yoga, facing a wall, Aḷavantār dared not disturb the Yogi and kept himself behind, at some distance. Lo! Appaṉ suddenly turned round and enquired whether some one belonging to the ‘Coṭṭai’ clan was standing behind. While humbly introducing himself as one of the said pedigree, Āḷavantār begged the Yogi to disclose how the presence of one staying well behind was at all perceived. Appaṉ revealed that, while holding a rapport with him, the Lord would not allow Himself to be disturbed by any one including His alluring and most-beloved spouse, Lakṣmī, and yet, pressing his neck, the Lord turned round, thrice or four times, in the hind direction. The Yogi was well aware that such an extra-ordinary preference was shown by the Lord only to members of the ‘Coṭṭai’ family and hence his enquiry, as above. Āḷavntār was the grandson of Śrīmaṉ Nāthamuṉi of ‘Coṭṭai’ pedigree (the family name). This shows that next to Nammāḻvār, affection of such great magnitude was lavished by the Lord, only on Śrīmaṉ Nāthamuṉi and his descendants.




## 2.6.3
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

தாமரைக் கண்ணனை விண்ணோர் பரவும் தலைமகனை, துழாய் விரைப்  
பூ மருவு கண்ணி எம் பிரானை பொன்மலையை,  
நாம் மருவி நன்கு ஏத்தி உள்ளி வணங்கி நாம் மகிழ்ந்து ஆட, நாவு அலர்  
பா மருவி நிற்கத் தந்த பான்மையே வள்ளலே.

tāmaraik kaṇṇaṉai viṇṇōr paravum talaimakaṉai, tuḻāy viraip  
pū maruvu kaṇṇi em pirāṉai poṉmalaiyai,  
nām maruvi naṉku ētti uḷḷi vaṇaṅki nām makiḻntu āṭa, nāvu alar  
pā maruvi niṟkat tanta pāṉmaiyē vaḷḷalē.

**English translation of verse 2.6.3:**

Adored by the Celestials, the lotus-eyed Lord,  
My benefactor great wearing the tulacī garland.  
Knit with fragrant flowers, a veritable mountain of gold.  
Him even we could well extol, singing thro’ songs, by us composed,  
And dancing in ecstasy, meditate and worship, how generous of Him indeed!.

**Notes**

\(i\) Entranced by the sweet glances from His lotus eyes, the celestials keep singing His glory, all the time. It was indeed very generous of the Lord, as the Āḻvār would put it, that He could likewise enable even him, so low, to meditate on Him and compose songs in His praise and sing besides revealing to him, out of His own free will and grace, His exquisite beauty, bedecked with tulacī garland, ever cool, ever lovely and ever fragrant.

\(ii\) Reference to the Lord, as a mountain of gold, shows that He is firmly established inside the Āḻvār, firm as a rock.




## 2.6.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வள்ளலே மதுசூதனா என் மரகத மலையே, உனை நினைந்து,  
எள்கல் தந்த எந்தாய் உன்னை எங்ஙனம் விடுகேன்,?  
வெள்ளமே புரை நின் புகழ் குடைந்து ஆடிப்பாடி களித்து உகந்து உகந்து  
உள்ள நோய்கள் எல்லாம் துரந்து உய்ந்து போந்திருந்தே.

vaḷḷalē matucūtaṉā eṉ marakata malaiyē, uṉai niṉaintu,  
eḷkal tanta entāy uṉṉai eṅṅaṉam viṭukēṉ,?  
veḷḷamē purai niṉ pukaḻ kuṭaintu āṭippāṭi kaḷittu ukantu ukantu  
uḷḷa nōykaḷ ellām turantu uyntu pōntiruntē.

**English translation of verse 2.6.4:**

My generous Lord! Matucūtaṉā! my delectable emerald Mount!  
My Sire! unto me You granted a mind, in you engrossed,  
Immersed in Your oceanic traits singing in merriment  
Your glory great and dancing; from all ills and evils released,  
You I have attained, how shall I give you up indeed?

**Note**

In the preceding song, the Āḻvār was again harping on his lowliness while acknowledging the many favours done to him by the Lord. Naturally, such expressions of the Āḻvār’s abject humility make the Lord ill at ease but the Āḻvār hastens to assure Him that, as the recipient of His spontaneous grace in the form of multifarious favours, he shall not give up the Lord, on any account. These favours include, of course, the removal of many an impediment in the way of their union, not the least of which is the Āḻvār’s inferiority complex, even as the Lord slew the demon, Madhu. All the erstwhile miseries and shortcomings of the Āḻvār stand drowned in the rapturous enjoyment, currently going on, singing and dancing in great merriment. There is, therefore, no question of his giving up such a generous Lord.




## 2.6.5
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

உய்ந்து போந்து என் உலப்பு இலாத வெம் தீவினைகளை நாசம் செய்து உனது  
அந்தம் இல் அடிமை அடைந்தேன் விடுவேனோ,?  
ஐந்து பைந்தலை ஆடு அரவு அணை மேவிப் பாற்கடல் யோக நித்திரை,  
சிந்தை செய்த எந்தாய் உன்னைச் சிந்தை செய்து செய்தே.

uyntu pōntu eṉ ulappu ilāta vem tīviṉaikaḷai nācam ceytu uṉatu  
antam il aṭimai aṭaintēṉ viṭuvēṉō,?  
aintu paintalai āṭu aravu aṇai mēvip pāṟkaṭal yōka nittirai,  
cintai ceyta entāy uṉṉaic cintai ceytu ceytē.

**English translation of verse 2.6.5:**

My Sire! in thoughts of universal welfare absorbed,  
You rest in the milky ocean, on Your five-hooded serpent-bed;  
Meditating on You, ever and anon, I stand delivered  
From my endless sins deadly and now in your perennial service ushered  
Will I from you ever try to get severed?

**Notes**

\(i\) Totally absorbed, that he is, in the daily service of the Lord, the Āḻvār avers that there is no question of his giving Him up.

\(ii\) Adīśeṣa (First servant) on whom the Lord rests in ‘Yoga Nidrā’, the highest form of psychic activity or self-activisation, is steeped in the enjoyment of perennial service unto the Lord, in many ways. Through each of his five heads, he gives vent to his joy, like the river in spate branching off into canals. Even as those under the influence of liquor dance about, Ādi-Śeṣa, intoxicated with God-love, gives expression to it by making his heads (hoods) dance with joy.




## 2.6.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

உன்னைச் சிந்தை செய்து செய்து, உன் நெடு மா மொழி இசைபாடி ஆடி என்  
முன்னைத் தீவினைகள் முழு வேர் அரிந்தனன் யான்,  
உன்னைச் சிந்தையினால் இகழ்ந்த இரணியன் அகல் மார்வம் கீண்ட என்  
முன்னைக் கோளரியே முடியாதது என் எனக்கே.

uṉṉaic cintai ceytu ceytu, uṉ neṭu mā moḻi icaipāṭi āṭi eṉ  
muṉṉait tīviṉaikaḷ muḻu vēr arintaṉaṉ yāṉ,  
uṉṉaic cintaiyiṉāl ikaḻnta iraṇiyaṉ akal mārvam kīṇṭa eṉ  
muṉṉaik kōḷariyē muṭiyātatu eṉ eṉakkē.

**English translation of verse 2.6.6:**

Mighty Narasiṅka! my primordial Lord!  
You split the broad chest of Iraṇiyaṉ, the demon,  
Who inwardly despised you but here am I, fully delivered  
From my age-long sins meditating on you, ever and anon,  
Dancing and singing sweetly your glory great  
Is there at all anything, this vassal of Yours cannot get?

**Notes**

Lord: Oh, Āḻvār! is there anything more 1 can do for you?

Āḻvār: Sire! what is there I haven’t got from you? My age-long sins have been rooted out, with a mind solely rivetted in you, I go on singing your great glory and dance in ecstasy. What more do I need?

The Lord is more keen to reward people than to punish them. Even if one’s praise of Him is only lip-deep, the Lord generously takes it at its face value, without probing deeper and exposing the hollowness. His omniscience and omnipotence notwithstanding. On the other hand, when one throws affront at Him, He does not straightaway punish without probing whether the offence was really meant or only casual. That is why Lord Narasiṅka explored Hiraṇya kaśipu, limb by limb, joint by joint, whether there was in him any love lurking for Him anywhere inside the demon. Unfortunately, there was none and the demon had to be vanquished.




## 2.6.7
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

முடியாதது என் எனக்கேல் இனி? முழு ஏழ் உலகும் உண்டான் உகந்து வந்து  
அடியேன் உட்புகுந்தான் அகல்வானும் அல்லன் இனி,  
செடி ஆர் நோய்கள் எல்லாம் துரந்து எமர் கீழ் மேல் எழு பிறப்பும்,  
விடியா வெம் நரகத்து என்றும் சேர்தல் மாறினரே.

muṭiyātatu eṉ eṉakkēl iṉi? muḻu ēḻ ulakum uṇṭāṉ ukantu vantu  
aṭiyēṉ uṭpukuntāṉ akalvāṉum allaṉ iṉi,  
ceṭi ār nōykaḷ ellām turantu emar kīḻ mēl eḻu piṟappum,  
viṭiyā vem narakattu eṉṟum cērtal māṟiṉarē.

**English translation of verse 2.6.7:**

What is there, this vassal cannot henceforth attain?  
The Lord, who gulped down all the worlds seven,  
Entered my mind with great relish, never again  
To part from me; those unto me connected for generations,  
Seven above and seven below, will from their sins dense  
Be freed, and never again shall they enter the cruel abyss, bottomless.

**Notes**

\(i\) The bottomless (endless) abyss or eternal hell, referred to here, is the ‘Saṃsāra’, the stye of worldly life, in which the worldlings are wallowing, caught up in its interminable labyrinth.

\(ii\) In the preceding song, the Āḻvār declared that there was nothing he could not attain. When asked by some persons whether he had got everything, the Āḻvār affirmed that the Lord’s benevolent grace did ṇot stop with him alone but extended to all those connected with him, the preceding and succeeding generations alike—that being the case, what mote would he need?




## 2.6.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மாறிமாறிப் பல பிறப்பும் பிறந்து அடியை அடைந்து உள்ளம் தேறி  
ஈறு இல் இன்பத்து இரு வெள்ளம் யான் மூழ்கினன்,  
பாறிப் பாறி அசுரர் தம் பல் குழாங்கள் நீறு எழ, பாய் பறவை ஒன்று  
ஏறி வீற்றிருந்தாய் உன்னை என்னுள் நீக்கேல் எந்தாய்.

māṟimāṟip pala piṟappum piṟantu aṭiyai aṭaintu uḷḷam tēṟi  
īṟu il iṉpattu iru veḷḷam yāṉ mūḻkiṉaṉ,  
pāṟip pāṟi acurar tam pal kuḻāṅkaḷ nīṟu eḻa, pāy paṟavai oṉṟu  
ēṟi vīṟṟiruntāy uṉṉai eṉṉuḷ nīkkēl entāy.

**English translation of verse 2.6.8:**

Passed I thro’ several gates of birth.  
From time to time and now at your lovely feet,  
With a mind, pure and chaste,  
Immersed am I in the bottomless ocean of mirth.  
Mounted on that bird unique, leaping afar, my Sire,  
Routing the Asura hordes! pray leave me never.

**Notes**

\(i\) Reference to the unique bird (Garuḍa) here is very significant. Even as the Lord presses Garuḍa into service, all the time and never gets parted from him, the Āḻvār prays that the Lord should take service from him for all time, keeping him in close proximity.

\(ii\) What is it that the Āḻvār did, to attain the feet of the Lord? “Absolutely nothing” is the answer. He went on, taking birth after birth, till one day, the Lord’s spontaneous grace alighted on him and took him to His vicinity, like unto the twig in the mid-ocean getting washed ashore, by successive waves.




## 2.6.9
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

எந்தாய்! தண் திருவேங்கடத்துள் நின்றாய் இலங்கை செற்றாய், மராமரம்  
பைந்தாள் ஏழ் உருவ ஒரு வாளி கோத்த வில்லா,  
கொந்து ஆர் தண் அம் துழாயினாய் அமுதே உன்னை என்னுள்ளே குழைத்த எம்  
மைந்தா, வான் ஏறே இனி எங்குப் போகின்றதே?

entāy! taṇ tiruvēṅkaṭattuḷ niṉṟāy ilaṅkai ceṟṟāy, marāmaram  
paintāḷ ēḻ uruva oru vāḷi kōtta villā,  
kontu ār taṇ am tuḻāyiṉāy amutē uṉṉai eṉṉuḷḷē kuḻaitta em  
maintā, vāṉ ēṟē iṉi eṅkup pōkiṉṟatē?

**English translation of verse 2.6.9:**

My Lord! gracing Tiruvēṅkaṭam, you stand on the cool mountain,  
You routed Laṅkā, pierce you did the tough trees seven  
With a single arrow, lovely tulacī garland, bushy and cool  
You sport, my Nectar! into me dissolved, you, my darling!  
Chief of Celestials!  
Is there anywhere You can get away hence?

**Note**

[Āḻvār to the Lord:]—

> “Unto me, who was steeped in ignorance, you revealed yourself and your
> excellence and worked me upto the present pitch, wheṇ I just cannot
> exist without you. Will it be just and proper for you to get parted
> from me, at this stage? As a matter of fact, you stepped on Mount
> Tiruvēṅkaṭam, only to get held of this vassal. Even as you routed
> Rāvaṇa and his Laṅkā, you eradicated my conceit and arrogance. Even as
> you instilled confidence in Sugrīva, before slaying his brother, Vāli,
> by piercing the cluster of seven ‘sāl’ trees, with a single arrow, you
> whetted my love for you by exhibiting your auspicious traits. Having
> mingled with me, *in toto*, without reservation of any kind, how can
> you at all get parted from me hereafter and where else will you go?”

The fact of the matter is that the blending of the two is so perfect that they are no longer two separate entities but just a single entity.




## 2.6.10
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

போகின்ற காலங்கள் போய காலங்கள் போகு காலங்கள் தாய் தந்தை உயிர்-  
ஆகின்றாய் உன்னை நான் அடைந்தேன் விடுவேனோ?  
பாகின்ற தொல் புகழ் மூவுலகுக்கும் நாதனே! பரமா, தண் வேங்கடம்  
மேகின்றாய் தண் துழாய் விரை நாறு கண்ணியனே.

**English translation of verse 2.6.10:**

Having got you, shall I ever leave you, the Super-eminent?  
Lord of all the three worlds, you grace Tiruvēṅkaṭam, the cool mount.  
Cool tulacī garland of fragrance sweet you do sport,  
Of eternal fame, far-reaching, You are unto me dear  
As Father, Mother and Soul, at all times, past, present and future.

**Notes**

\(i\) *Lord to the Āḻvār*:

> “Well, you are asking me, not to leave you. But my anxiety is about
> you, whether you might once again run away from me, struck down, by
> your feeling of lowliness. Please, therefore, assure me that you will
> not leave me and go”.

*Āḻvār to the Lord*: Reply as in the stanza, above.

\(ii\) A doubt might be raised how the Āḻvār could talk about the benefits he would be receiving, in future, as well. Well, the Lord is the Sole Benefactor, at all times, past, present and future. After all, the present is itself, the future of the past and will, in turn, become the past of the future. Time-sequence makes no difference at all. the Lord being the constant Benefactor, at all times.




## 2.6.11
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கண்ணித் தண் அம் துழாய் முடிக் கமலத் தடம் பெருங் கண்ணனைப், புகழ்  
நண்ணி தென் குருகூர்ச் சடகோபன் மாறன் சொன்ன,  
எண்ணில் சோர்வு இல் அந்தாதி ஆயிரத்துள் இவையும் ஓர் பத்து இசையொடும்,  
பண்ணில் பாட வல்லார் அவர் கேசவன் தமரே.

paṇṇil pāṭa vallār avar kēcavaṉ tamarē.

**English translation of verse 2.6.11:**

Those that sing tunefully these songs ten,  
Out of the thousand composed by Kurukūr Caṭakōpaṉ  
Scion of Māṟaṉ, singing the glory of the Lord, with large lotus-eyes,  
Wearing on His crown the tulacī garland, cool and nice  
Will join the rank and file of Kēcavaṉ’s (the Lord’s) devotees.

**Note**

The glory of the Lord, referred to here, in particular, is His boundless love (vyāmoha) for His devotees, like that shown unto the Āḻvār. To become His devotee, one has only to sing these ten songs, tunefully. Caste, creed and colour shall not stand in his/her way.
