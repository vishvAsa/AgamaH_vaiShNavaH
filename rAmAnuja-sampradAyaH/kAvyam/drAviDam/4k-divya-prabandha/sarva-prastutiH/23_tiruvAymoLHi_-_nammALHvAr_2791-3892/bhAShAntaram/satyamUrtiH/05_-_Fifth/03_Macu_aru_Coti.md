## 00 Intro5.3
The Āḻvār now reverts to the state that obtained in IV-8 and is all agog to get united with the Lord. Non-fulfilment of his intense longing, however, induces him to contemplate the drastic step of coming into the open and carrying his tale of woe to the public at large so that the unresponsive Lord could be arraigned at the bar of public opinion and the union with Him got accelerated. It might be recalled that Śrī Rāma who had invoked the King of the oceans, got furious, when the latter didn’t turn up, and bade Lakṣmaṇa to bring unto Him the bow, so that the entire ocean could be dried up for the monkey battalions to walk through to the other shore. The frustrated Āḻvār is also likewise poised to negative God-head altogether, if the union longed for, so intensely, by him cannot materialise, there and then.

It can now be easily inferred that the Āḻvār is once again in the ‘Nāyakī’ state, that is, the forlorn female lover, weighed down by the intensity of God-love, unable to brook separation from her Beloved, any longer. In Tamil literature, there is what is called the ‘maṭal’, the episode of the hero going a-hunting and casually meeting the heroine who happens to be alone, having got accidentally separated from her maids when they were all playing about, picking up flowers etc. The hero and the heroine exchange erotic glances and part. The heroine whose heart has been stolen away by the hero, draws a sketch of him and keeps on gazing at it, days on end; she languishes without food, does not tend her person, scratches her body with the teeth of a palmyrah stem and runs about with dishevelled hair, bitterly complaining to the on-lookers that she has been badly let down by a heartless fellow and things of that sort. Moved by the piteous condition of the forlorn lady, the people would intervene to hasten the union of the hero and the heroine to the hero himself would rush in, terrified by the slander heaped on his head, and take the lady. The third alternative would, of course, be for the lady to seek relief through death (suicide). The underlying sentiment is thus ardent love, egging the desperate lover on, to a public declaration of such love, sometimes culminating in the tragic act of self-immolation. ‘Tolkāppiyam’, the ancient Tamil work, seems to confine this to the males only, the mad lovers riding to death, through the Streets, on the toothed edge of a palmyrah stem, as if on a horse. But, in the North, females were also permitted to have recourse to ‘maṭal’ (e.g.) Sītā, Vegavati, Vāsavadattāi, Umā, Uṣā, Ulūpikā etc.

The Āḻvār’s contemplated move is indeed extraordinary, the more so when he is in the vanguard of ‘Prapannas’ who are not to invoke any means other than God Himself and put to the imperative necessity of catering to His sole delight. Nevertheless, it cannot be criticised as improper; it is the exuberance of such love-intoxicated super-personalities that made them overshoot their mark. The Āḻvārs were no doubt endowed with supreme knowledge by the Lord Himself and they could, therefore, be expected to be above criticism. But their knowledge was not the dry-as-dust stock but one transformed into intellectual love of God. In the exuberance of such love they were thrown into a state of mental imbalance (Bhakti pāravaśya) and acts performed in such a state are indeed praiseworthy and, surely, these are not comparable with the transgressions committed by the common people due to immaturity and ignorance in a relatively unevolved state, still under the grip of nescience. The Āḻvār’s mental attitude is but an inevitable facet of God-love, seeking quick consummation by the Lord. It is worth contrasting the Nāyakī’s present stance with that in IV-8. Whereas she was then prepared to abjure herself and her possessions if they could not be engaged in the Lord’s service, she is now out to destroy Him and His cosmic wealth if He would not make Himself pliable to her. The mate could no longer keep the Nāyakī under sobering restraint and the latter was determined to destroy God-bead even at the cost of her own destruction. The Lord could no longer afford to be a passive witness to this state of affairs and, therefore, He presented Himself to the Nāyakī and thus redeemed her and Himself.




## 5.3.1
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மாசு அறு சோதி என் செய்ய வாய் மணிக்குன்றத்தை  
ஆசு அறு சீலனை ஆதி மூர்த்தியை நாடியே  
பாசறவு எய்தி அறிவு இழந்து எனை நாளையம்?  
ஏசு அறும் ஊரவர் கவ்வை தோழீ என் செய்யுமே?

mācu aṟu cōti eṉ ceyya vāy maṇikkuṉṟattai  
ācu aṟu cīlaṉai āti mūrttiyai nāṭiyē  
pācaṟavu eyti aṟivu iḻantu eṉai nāḷaiyam?  
ēcu aṟum ūravar kavvai tōḻī eṉ ceyyumē?

**English translation of verse 5.3.1:**

You know, my mate, my awareness is lost  
And my lustre gone since long, in quest  
Of the primordial Lord of splendour unalloyed and coral lips,  
The mount of emerald, of loving condescension with no lapse;  
How then will the rebuke of slanderous folks affect me?

### Notes

\(i\) The mates of Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī, who had prior knowledge of her contemplated move, dissuaded her, in a low whisper, from going ahead with it, lest the people around should reproach her for her aggressive stance. The Nāyakī was, however, not in the least worried about public opinion; as a matter of fact, she had become impervious to it long back. The Nāyakī stood on a pedestal of her own and the magnitude of her privation from God, of Supreme eminence, was not comparable with any known to the common man of the world. Hence her reactions were also bound to differ widely from those of the worldlings in regard to their individual privations.

\(ii\) The Āḻvār was no doubt endowed by the Lord with knowledge, full and complete. But, intoxicated by God-love, the Nāyakī had long ago lost her mental equipoise; else, would she fall at the feet of bees and birds and beg of them to carry her message to God?




## 5.3.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

என் செய்யும் ஊரவர் கவ்வை தோழீ இனி நம்மை  
என் செய்ய தாமரைக் கண்ணன் என்னை நிறை கொண்டான்  
முன் செய்ய மாமை இழந்து மேனி மெலிவு எய்தி  
என் செய்ய வாயும் கருங்கண்ணும் பயப்பு ஊர்ந்தவே.

eṉ ceyyum ūravar kavvai tōḻī iṉi nammai  
eṉ ceyya tāmaraik kaṇṇaṉ eṉṉai niṟai koṇṭāṉ  
muṉ ceyya māmai iḻantu mēṉi melivu eyti  
eṉ ceyya vāyum karuṅkaṇṇum payappu ūrntavē.

**English translation of verse 5.3.2:**

My Lord with red-lotus eyes robbed me of my modesty.  
With my complexion gone, my body is thinning down,  
The hue of my red lips and eyes black is also going down  
What indeed is the reproof of these folks unto me?

**Note**

Queried by her mates as to how she could afford to ignore public opinion and be indifferent to it, the Nāyakī says that she is well past that stage, having lost all sense of awareness of the world long ago, when the Supreme Lord of exquisite charm stole away her heart. Pining for Him, she has thinned down alarmingly and is terribly off-colour. When she recounts these disquieting changes, it is not by way of stating her own loss; these were the things which had once attracted the Lord and the loss is, therefore, His and not hers.




## 5.3.3
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஊர்ந்த சகடம் உதைத்த பாதத்தன் பேய்முலை-  
சார்ந்து சுவைத்த செவ்வாயன் என்னை நிறை கொண்டான்  
பேர்ந்தும் பெயர்ந்தும் அவனோடு அன்றி ஓர் சொல் இலேன்  
தீர்ந்த என் தோழீ! என் செய்யும் ஊரவர் கவ்வையே?

ūrnta cakaṭam utaitta pātattaṉ pēymulai-  
cārntu cuvaitta cevvāyaṉ eṉṉai niṟai koṇṭāṉ  
pērntum peyarntum avaṉōṭu aṉṟi ōr col ilēṉ  
tīrnta eṉ tōḻī! eṉ ceyyum ūravar kavvaiyē?

**English translation of verse 5.3.3:**

My seasoned mate, now and again, I keep talking of none  
But the coral-lipped Lord who sucked the life out of the demon  
And unto pieces kicked the devilish wheel; He robbed me  
Of my traits feminine and now what is it to me,  
The rebuke of these slanderous folks around?

### Note

Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī enlightens her mate by saying that the Lord kicked the demon who entered the cart-wheel, to a thousand pieces, and sucked the demoness who feigned as the good mother, unto death, only to attract her and steal her heart away. It was earlier assumed by the mate that these incidents formed part of the general scheme of annihilation of the Lord’s enemies set upon Him by Kaṃsa.

The Nāyakī feels tortured and tormented, due to her separation from the Lord. The mate whose role it is to put the Nāyakī on to her beloved, now questions the Nāyakī’s wisdom in being soaked in God-love despite her pangs of separation from the Lord and suggests that she might as well turn her attention on other things and get over her misery. But the Nāyakī asserts that her thoughts are always rivetted to Him and consequently, her conversation has to necessarily revolve round Him. This gladdens the heart of the mate, quite in keeping with her true role and she hugs the Nāyaki to her bosom, in appreciation of the Nāyakī’s steadfast love to God. It is against this background that the Nāyakī addresses her mate as the seasoned one. This is like Sītā’s appreciation of Hanumān, after her initial doubts about his bonafides were dispelled.




## 5.3.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஊரவர் கவ்வை எரு இட்டு அன்னை சொல் நீர் படுத்து  
ஈர நெல் வித்தி முளைத்த நெஞ்சப் பெருஞ் செய்யுள்  
பேர் அமர் காதல் கடல் புரைய விளைவித்த  
கார் அமர் மேனி நம் கண்ணன் தோழீ! கடியனே

ūravar kavvai eru iṭṭu aṉṉai col nīr paṭuttu  
īra nel vitti muḷaitta neñcap peruñ ceyyuḷ  
pēr amar kātal kaṭal puraiya viḷaivitta  
kār amar mēṉi nam kaṇṇaṉ tōḻī! kaṭiyaṉē

**English translation of verse 5.3.4:**

Kaṉṉaṉ, my cloud-hued Lord, has indeed done me so much;  
The rebukes of the folks around He made the manure rich,  
My mother’s sobering counsel, the channel of irrigation  
And sowed He the seed of devotion that raised the crop rich.  
Of God-love, in the spacious field of my heart, big as the ocean;  
Could such a one, my mate, be dubbed cruel devoid of compassion!

### Notes

\(i\) *Mate to the Nāyakī*: “I don’t mind your being indifferent to public opinion, if the Lord were at least with you, but now, you are neither here nor there. Why not give up the Lord who seems to treat you as of no consequence?”.

*Nāyakī to the Mate*: “Is it you speaking like this? How can I at all blame the Lord Who has kindled in me the undying flame of love? Smitten I am, no doubt, by the reproof of these folks, on one side and the poignance of my separation from the Lord on the other. But, don’t you see that my mind dwells not on any but Him, under all circumstances?”

\(ii\) This song indicates the manner in which God-love of such magnitude was generated in the Nāyakī. The earthlings tried to nip her God-love right in the bud but their admonitions only intensified her love and thus proved a blessing in disguise. The constant attention of her mother and her wholesome counsel tended and nurtured this God-love in the Nāyakī, like unto a steady flow of water irrigating the fields. Having created such a fertile background, the Lord, as an indefatigable cultivator, sowed the seed of devotion in the Nayakī’s heart and there sprouted the rich crop of God-love, sustained further by the vision of His exquisite Form, like unto the rain-cloud. The precise manner in which the Lord reclaims the sense-buried Soul and eventually takes it on to His exalted abode has been admirably set out in aphorism 104 of Ācārya Hṛdayam.




## 5.3.5
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கடியன் கொடியன் நெடிய மால் உலகம் கொண்ட-  
அடியன் அறிவு அரு மேனி மாயத்தன் ஆகிலும்-  
கொடிய என் நெஞ்சம் அவன் என்றே கிடக்கும் எல்லே  
துடி கொள் இடை மடத் தோழீ! அன்னை என் செய்யுமே?

kaṭiyaṉ koṭiyaṉ neṭiya māl ulakam koṇṭa-  
aṭiyaṉ aṟivu aru mēṉi māyattaṉ ākilum-  
koṭiya eṉ neñcam avaṉ eṉṟē kiṭakkum ellē  
tuṭi koḷ iṭai maṭat tōḻī! aṉṉai eṉ ceyyumē?

**English translation of verse 5.3.5:**

Agile and alert or cruelly indifferent could be the Lord,  
Big beyond comprehension, His feet measured the worlds,  
His form bewitching puts one in a daze and yet  
My stubborn mind clings to Him alone, my thin-waisted, modest mate!  
How can mother over me prevail [if you can’t]?

### Notes

\(i\) The Nāyakī reinforces her stand vis-a-vis the Lord, as set out in the preceding song, by stating that she would adore the Lord even if He were to be a callous despot, bereft of good qualities, and that it was, therefore, no use trying to draw her away from the Lord. Be it a matter of recounting the auspicious traits of the Lord or of cataloguing His oppressive methods and tactics as listed in this song, the Nāyakī was indeed far more competent than the mate. This is because it is the Nāyakī and not the mate who has alternately tasted the bliss of union with the Lord and suffered the pangs of separation from Him.

\(ii\) If it suited His purpose, He could do a thing with the utmost speed and pounce upon the Subject, lulling the latter into a sense of false security that the union would last for ever; He would also not hesitate to leave the Subject in great distress by snapping Himself suddenly. Bent upon getting back the Kingdom lost by Indra, the Lord would leave no space for Bali and send him to the depths of the underworld. Knowing these oppressive tactics of the Lord as well as she did, the Nāyakī would nevertheless cling fast to Him. Drawbacks though these might be, still they are His drawbacks and the Lord’s contact with them is enough to make the Nāyakī feel attracted to them. The emphasis is on the Lord’s contact, as such and not the nature or quality of the contact c.f. aphorisms 108 to 110 of ‘Śrī Vacana Bhūṣaṇa’. Were it not disinterested love of God, love for its own sake, as distinguished from love induced by the Lord’s auspicious traits, there should be an end of such love during those moments when the devotee feels frustrated and thinks that God is bereft of all those endearing qualities, he pined for. The Lord might be anything, selfish, time-serving, elusive and so on, but He shall be the sole refuge of the Āḻvār, under all circumstances. In Periya Tirumoḻi, XI-8-7 Tirumaṅkai Āḻvār also picturesquely brings home the inalienability of the ‘Master-Servant’ relationship between God and Man, whatever be the vicissitudes. Addressing the Lord, he says: “My Lord! you are generally known to be sweet as sugar-cane; even if you turn bitter like the margosa fruit, I, Your eternal servant, will covet nothing else but Your comely feet, like unto the caterpillar, bred on margosa leaf, eating nothing but that.”

\(iii\) It is worth recalling, in this context what transpired between Anasūya Devi, wife of Sage Atri, and Sītā. Felicitating Sītā on her fidelity to her husband (giving up the palace and all its wealth and relatives and following Śrī Rāma into exile) Anasūya Devi exhorted that the husband needs to be venerated as God Himself, be he in town or wood, well or ill. Swayed by modesty, the bashful Sītā stood with down-cast eyes and spoke out: “It is indeed difficult for one to prove that my fidelity to Rāma stands by itself without any external provocations or inducements, as Rāma and his excellence can never remain apart. My fidelity will remain constant even if he were the exact reverse of what he is”.




## 5.3.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அன்னை என் செய்யில் என்? ஊர் என் சொல்லில் என்? தோழிமீர்  
என்னை இனி உமக்கு ஆசை இல்லை அகப்பட்டேன்  
முன்னை அமரர் முதல்வன் வண் துவராபதி-  
மன்னன் மணிவண்ணன் வாசுதேவன் வலையுளே.

aṉṉai eṉ ceyyil eṉ? ūr eṉ collil eṉ? tōḻimīr  
eṉṉai iṉi umakku ācai illai akappaṭṭēṉ  
muṉṉai amarar mutalvaṉ vaṇ tuvarāpati-  
maṉṉaṉ maṇivaṇṇaṉ vācutēvaṉ valaiyuḷē.

**English translation of verse 5.3.6:**

It matters not, my mate, what the mother says  
Or the folks around, leave me alone, will you?  
Ensnared am I by Vācutēvan of sapphire hue  
Prince of Tuvārakai, the city beautiful, chief of ‘*Nityas*’.

### Notes

\(i\) *Nityas*—the ‘Nitya Sūrīs’ or the Eternal Heroes, the ever-free angels in heaven.

\(ii\) Finding the Nāyakī implacable, her mates tried to impress upon her that, by her conduct, she would only imperil the life of her mother and it would be a terrible loss, all round—the Lord hasn’t come to her, her mother would die and the folks around would heap abuses on her. But the Nāyakī tells them that, entranced as she is by the bewitching looks of Lord Kṛṣṇa, Prince of Dvārakā, all the above considerations would be of no avail and that they would do well not to pin their hopes on her any more. Actually, she has lost alike her vision and heart unto her Lord.




## 5.3.7
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வலையுள் அகப்படுத்து என்னை நல் நெஞ்சம் கூவிக்கொண்டு  
அலை கடல் பள்ளி அம்மானை ஆழிப்பிரான் தன்னை  
கலை கொள் அகல் அல்குல் தோழீ! நம் கண்களால் கண்டு  
தலையில் வணங்கவும் ஆம் கொலோ? தையலார் முன்பே.

valaiyuḷ akappaṭuttu eṉṉai nal neñcam kūvikkoṇṭu  
alai kaṭal paḷḷi ammāṉai āḻippirāṉ taṉṉai  
kalai koḷ akal alkul tōḻī! nam kaṇkaḷāl kaṇṭu  
talaiyil vaṇaṅkavum ām kolō? taiyalār muṉpē.

**English translation of verse 5.3.7:**

My lovely mate, well-clad, shall we with our eyes behold  
The Lord who ensnared me and away with my good heart fled  
And rested on the surging ocean, the Benefactor, who the discus wields  
And bow unto Him, well in front of these (rebuking) ladies?

**Notes:**

\(i\) The Nāyakī longs for the Lord’s presence so as to enable her to fall at His feet, right in front of the slanderous folks and silence them. These folks were slandering the Lord as faithless to the Nāyakī and the latter as foolishly sticking on to Him.

\(ii\) When Kūrathaḻvāṉ discoursed on this song in a place called Rājēntracōḻaṉ, a centenarian got up, shaking from head to foot and reverently queried whether it would be appropriate for the Nāyakī to bow unto her lover. The illustrious discourser quoted Sītā’s conduct in this regard as the precedent. She told Hanumān when he took leave of her in Aśokavana at Laṅkā; “Pray, tell Śrī Rāma, corn to protect the entire world, that I prostrate unto Him”. Sundara Kāṇḍa XXXVIII 53.

The Sandals got separated from Rāma and went north. Sītā was separated from Him, later on, and she went south. Whereas the sandals, installed on the throne ruled over a whole Kingdom, Sītā was a miserable captive in Laṅkā, tormented and tortured by the seven hundred and odd Rākṣasīs. Sītā must have pondered within herself and realised that this disparity was due to the contact of the Sandals with Śrī Rāma’s feet and the absence of such contact, in her case. Therefore it is that she now tells Hanumān, the Ācārya, that she prostrates at the feet of her Lord, albeit from that distance.




## 5.3.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

பேய் முலை உண்டு சகடம் பாய்ந்து மருது இடை-  
போய் முதல் சாய்த்து புள் வாய் பிளந்து களிறு அட்ட  
தூ முறுவல் தொண்டைவாய்ப் பிரானை எந் நாள்கொலோ  
யாம் உறுகின்றது தோழீ! அன்னையர் நாணவே?

pēy mulai uṇṭu cakaṭam pāyntu marutu iṭai-  
pōy mutal cāyttu puḷ vāy piḷantu kaḷiṟu aṭṭa  
tū muṟuval toṇṭaivāyp pirāṉai en nāḷkolō  
yām uṟukiṉṟatu tōḻī! aṉṉaiyar nāṇavē?

**English translation of verse 5.3.8:**

When shall we attain, my mate, the coral-lipped Lord,  
Of smiles pure, who the demon’s breast sucked, crawled  
‘Tween the twin trees and uprooted, unto pieces smashed  
The wheel, cleaved the bird’s beak and the elephant slammed,  
So that these elders do their heads hang ir shame?

### Note

The Nāyakī enumerates the deeds of Lord Kṛṣṇa, directed towards the annihilation of the evil forces, the opponents of the devotees. If such a great Benefactor could come and join her, it would put to shame the elders who were all bereft of good qualities, condemning Him as heartless, faithless and so on. It needs to be specially noted that the Lord’s appearance is sought, in this song, by the Nāyaki, not for her embrace but to vindicate her Lord’s glory in the eyes of the elders as the One who is not only quite responsive but also remorseful. Did He not, as Śrī Rāma, rush to the Ṛṣis of Daṇḍakāraṇya, to enquire their needs and place His services at their disposal and apologise to them profusely, finding that they had already come a few steps forward to exhibit their sufferings at the hands of the Rākṣasas?




## 5.3.9
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நாணும் நிறையும் கவர்ந்து என்னை நல் நெஞ்சம் கூவிக்கொண்டு  
சேண் உயர் வானத்து இருக்கும் தேவ பிரான் தன்னை  
ஆணை என் தோழீ! உலகுதோறு அலர் தூற்றி ஆம்-  
கோணைகள் செய்து குதிரியாய் மடல் ஊர்துமே.

nāṇum niṟaiyum kavarntu eṉṉai nal neñcam kūvikkoṇṭu  
cēṇ uyar vāṉattu irukkum tēva pirāṉ taṉṉai  
āṇai eṉ tōḻī! ulakutōṟu alar tūṟṟi ām-  
kōṇaikaḷ ceytu kutiriyāy maṭal ūrtumē.

**English translation of verse 5.3.9:**

Oh, mate, be sure, I shall unto *maṭal* resort, getting out of hand  
And arraign, in every way and in all lands,  
The Chief of the Celestials, Who my good mind stole  
Besides my shyness and modesty and stays now in the heaven tall.

### Note

in the seventh song of this decad. the Nāyakī had complained that the Lord had stolen her heart and fled with it to the milk-ocean. Apprehending that the Nāyakī might get at Him even there, He seems to have since gone to the high heavens, so as to be out of her reach. But the Nāyakī is now determined to get out of her shell and ferret Him out wherever He might go and expose Him thoroughly all over the land.




## 5.3.10
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

யாம் மடல் ஊர்ந்தும் எம் ஆழி அங்கைப் பிரான் உடை  
தூ மடல் தண் அம் துழாய் மலர் கொண்டு சூடுவோம்  
ஆம் மடம் இன்றி தெருவுதோறு அயல் தையலார்  
நா மடங்காப் பழி தூற்றி நாடும் இரைக்கவே.

yām maṭal ūrntum em āḻi aṅkaip pirāṉ uṭai  
tū maṭal taṇ am tuḻāy malar koṇṭu cūṭuvōm  
ām maṭam iṉṟi teruvutōṟu ayal taiyalār  
nā maṭaṅkāp paḻi tūṟṟi nāṭum iraikkavē.

**English translation of verse 5.3.10:**

Shaking off all reserve, street after street shall I enter  
And make women in all the worlds shout beside me and clamour,  
In sheer sympathy for me, having recourse to *maṭal*,  
And from the Lord, wielding the discus lovely, procure  
And wear the tuḷaci garland, cool and lovely, with petals pure.

### Note

If the Nāyakī contemplates such a drastic move, totally repugnant to her essential nature, it is because of the exuberance of her God-love and the resultant intolerance of delayed consummation. This aspect has already been dealt with, *in extenso*, in the preamble to this decad. At the end of all these hectic activities, all that the Nāyakī aspires for is the Lord’s tuḷaci garland, that sacred basil. The Nāyakī still hopes that, frightened by this harrowing state of her darting forth, with ‘*Maṭal*’ (the tooth-edged branch of the palmy-rah tree) in hand, the Lord would rush forward, with discus in hand, and placate her by bedecking her with the tuḷaci garland worn on His person; if, however, He did not turn up, it would mean, she threatens, the end of them both as in a holocaust.




## 5.3.11
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

இரைக்கும் கருங் கடல் வண்ணன் கண்ண பிரான் தன்னை  
விரைக் கொள் பொழில் குருகூர்ச் சடகோபன் சொன்ன  
நிரைக் கொள் அந்தாதி ஓர் ஆயிரத்துள் இப்பத்தும்  
உரைக்க வல்லார்க்கு வைகுந்தம் ஆகும் தம் ஊர் எல்லாம் (2)

iraikkum karuṅ kaṭal vaṇṇaṉ kaṇṇa pirāṉ taṉṉai  
viraik koḷ poḻil kurukūrc caṭakōpaṉ coṉṉa  
niraik koḷ antāti ōr āyirattuḷ ippattum  
uraikka vallārkku vaikuntam ākum tam ūr ellām (2)

**English translation of verse 5.3.11:**

Those that chant these songs ten,  
Out of the thousand, chaste and elegant, of Caṭakōpaṉ,  
From Kurukūr, abounding in orchards, full of fragrance,  
Adoring Lord Kaṇṇaṉ, of the hue of the roaring ocean.  
Will heavenly bliss enjoy right at their residence.

### Notes

\(i\) The Lord will court those that recite these ten songs and remain inseparably united with them. Where the Lord is there is Heaven and thus the chanters of this Tiruvāy-moḻi (decad) get the Heaven transported unto them.

\(ii\) “*Roaring ocean*”—The ocean is in a state of upheaval, the bottom of the sea throwing the sands right up to the surface in violent agitation, like unto the king of the ocean who appeared before Rāma trembling, when the latter threatened to drive a shaft into the bosom of the sea and dry it up altogether. The Lord was in the same predicament as the King of the ocean when the Nāyaki threatened Him with dire consequences.
