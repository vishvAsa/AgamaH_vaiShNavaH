## 00 Intro6.3
In VI-1, the Saint sent messages to Lord Rāma at Tiruvaṇvaṇṭūr but He responded, rather late. This made the Nāyakī furious and she enacted, in the preceding decad, all that tussle, which ensued between Śrī Kṛṣṇa and the Gopīs. Ultimately, the Lord proved victorious, as seen in VI-2-10, and the reunion between Him and the Saint materialised. The Saint now keeps musing over the superior might of the Lord, in having weaned him round, despite his stout resolve not to have anything to do with that malingering defaulter any more. The Lord reveals to the Āḻvār His extraordinary capacity for achieving the impossible besides the glorious Iconic Form in which He stays in Tiruviṇṇakar (In Tamil-nadu, near Tirukkuṭantai, covered by V-8). The Āḻvār recounts this experience, in the current decad.




## 6.3.1
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நல்குரவும் செல்வும் நரகும் சுவர்க்கமும் ஆய்  
வெல்பகையும் நட்பும் விடமும் அமுதமும் ஆய்  
பல்வகையும் பரந்த பெருமான் என்னை ஆள்வானை  
செல்வம் மல்குகுடித் திருவிண்ணகர்க் கண்டேனே. (2)

nalkuravum celvum narakum cuvarkkamum āy  
velpakaiyum naṭpum viṭamum amutamum āy  
palvakaiyum paranta perumāṉ eṉṉai āḷvāṉai  
celvam malkukuṭit tiruviṇṇakark kaṇṭēṉē. (2)

**English translation of verse 6.3.1:**

Seen have I in Tiruviṇṇakar, with riches filled,  
My Liege-Lord, Who does encompass in His universe vast.  
Pelf and penury, hell and Svarga, love and hatred,  
Poison and nectar and many such opposites.

### Notes

\(i\) The Āḻvār says that he has seen in Tiruviṇṇakar, the the Lord who composes within Himself all the incompatibles. It is He who kept kucela poor initially, then made him rich and again pushed him into penury. It is He that puts some people in the luxurious and delightful Svarga and consigns some others to the dismal hell; He engenders in us hatred as well as love for Him, the one who hates Him is made to love Him and vice versa. For example, the inveterate Kanṭā-karṇa became friendly to the Lord whereas Śīmālika who was an intimate friend of His, got his head severed by the Lord’s discus. It is the Lord who gave Śiva poison and nectar to the Devās; He is like poison unto some and like nectar unto others. Actually, those that look upon everything as forming part of the Lord’s immense possessions, vast and varied, will acquire perfect mental equanimity, making no distinction between these opposite pairs, neither elated by the one nor depressed by the other.

\(ii\) The Lord, enshrined in this pilgrim centre (Tiruviṇṇakar), is called by the Āḻvār as ‘Oppili Appaṉ’, the peerless Sire, vide the ninth-song, while the Purāṇik tradition carries the Lord’s name as “*Uppili Appaṉ*”, *salt-free* dishes being offered to Him during the diurnal worship.




## 6.3.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கண்ட இன்பம் துன்பம் கலக்கங்களும் தேற்றமும் ஆய்  
தண்டமும் தண்மையும் தழலும் நிழலும் ஆய்  
கண்டுகோடற்கு அரிய பெருமான் என்னை ஆள்வான் ஊர்  
தெண் திரைப் புனல்சூழ் திருவிண்ணகர் நல் நகரே

kaṇṭa iṉpam tuṉpam kalakkaṅkaḷum tēṟṟamum āy  
taṇṭamum taṇmaiyum taḻalum niḻalum āy  
kaṇṭukōṭaṟku ariya perumāṉ eṉṉai āḷvāṉ ūr  
teṇ tiraip puṉalcūḻ tiruviṇṇakar nal nakarē

**English translation of verse 6.3.2:**

Tiruviṇṇakar, the lovely city the limpid waters surround,  
Is where my Lord stays, whose possessions vast none can comprehend;  
He is at once pleasure and pain, one sees around,  
Clarity and confusion, fury and favour, blistering heat and cool shade.

### Note

This is just a follow-up of the theme mooted in the preceding song, the blending in Him of the opposites. Sensual pleasures, hankered after by many, are studiously eschewed by those blessed by Him, as a serious impediment in the way of attaining Him. Again, there are the book-worms, who despite their immense reading do not have clear ideas, suffering as they do from lack of proper assimilation and the Lord’s grace which helps such assimilation. The unlettered score easily over the so-called scholars and, by the grace of their Preceptors, enjoy absolute clarity of thought and understanding. This has already been illustrated in the notes under I-9-6. In respect of the impious and ungodly (Asuras), the Lord is fast and furious and is in no mood to forgive them, while, at the same time, He swears by His devotees, that they are above mistakes and even if they commit mistakes, according to others, He takes them all in good light, saying that they have done well. The climate, with its components of heat and cold, is also controlled by the Lord. Look at the Saints who see heat in cold when the Lord does not commune with them and cold in heat when in His company. In fact, there is nothing in the Lord’s Universe, which is not worthy of love, so far as Saints are concerned, in view of their universal outlook, making them see God everywhere. Two devotees, by name, Cēṉāpati tācar and Nallār travelled together to the Holy hill of Tirupati. On the way, Tācar beat the bushes with a stick to clear the way. This brought forth a sharp rebuke from Nallār who asked: “Comrade, why do you punish God’s bush which has not stood in the way of your desires (wealth and lust)?”




## 6.3.3
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நகரமும் நாடுகளும் ஞானமும் மூடமும் ஆய்  
நிகர் இல் சூழ் சுடர் ஆய் இருள் ஆய் நிலன் ஆய் விசும்பு ஆய்  
சிகர மாடங்கள் சூழ் திருவிண்ணகர் சேர்ந்த பிரான்  
புகர் கொள் கீர்த்தி அல்லால் இல்லை யாவர்க்கும் புண்ணியமே.

nakaramum nāṭukaḷum ñāṉamum mūṭamum āy  
nikar il cūḻ cuṭar āy iruḷ āy nilaṉ āy vicumpu āy  
cikara māṭaṅkaḷ cūḻ tiruviṇṇakar cērnta pirāṉ  
pukar koḷ kīrtti allāl illai yāvarkkum puṇṇiyamē.

**English translation of verse 6.3.3:**

For one and all, salvation lies only in the glowing grace  
Of the Lord in Tiruviṇṇakar, with its towering mansions,  
Who is at once hall and hamlet, intelligence and ignorance;  
The sky and Earth, pitched darkness and peerless brilliance.

### Note

There are some, enjoying the luxuries of life in big cities with extra amenities while there are others, toiling hard and eking out a miserable existence in the villages with no amenities whatsoever. Well, these are all controlled and regulated by the Lord. The correct perception of things, with due intelligence as well as misconception resulting from ignorance, light and darkness, the concrete Earth and the nebulous Sky, all these are directed by the Lord who resides in Tiruviṇṇakar, in His ‘Arca’ (iconic) Form, wherein converge all His excellences in a perfect measure. It is here, in this land of darkness and nescience, that His auspicious qualities shine all the more, unlike the Heaven where it is just like a lamp burning in broad day-light.




## 6.3.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

புண்ணியம் பாவம் புணர்ச்சி பிரிவு என்று இவை ஆய்  
எண்ணம் ஆய் மறப்பு ஆய் உண்மை ஆய் இன்மை ஆய் அல்லன் ஆய்  
திண்ண மாடங்கள் சூழ் திருவிண்ணகர் சேர்ந்த பிரான்  
கண்ணன் இன் அருளே கண்டுகொள்மின்கள் கைதவமே

puṇṇiyam pāvam puṇarcci pirivu eṉṟu ivai āy  
eṇṇam āy maṟappu āy uṇmai āy iṉmai āy allaṉ āy  
tiṇṇa māṭaṅkaḷ cūḻ tiruviṇṇakar cērnta pirāṉ  
kaṇṇaṉ iṉ aruḷē kaṇṭukoḷmiṉkaḷ kaitavamē

**English translation of verse 6.3.4:**

Know, Ye, ‘tis all the sweet, spontaneous grace of Kaṇṇaṉ, enshrined  
In Tiruviṇṇakar, with its solid mansions. Who in Him combines  
Merit and demerit, solidarity and segregation,  
Remembrance and forgetfulness, truth and falsehood and yet remains  
To all these unattached; should this solid truth are one-question?

### Notes

\(i\) ‘Puṇya’, giving rise to happiness and ‘Pāpa’ leading to misery, the corresponding pleasure of enjoying the coveted things and pain of privation from them, are directed and regulated by the Supreme Lord.

\(ii\) Again, remembrance and forgetfulness, the truth revealing His existence and the falsehood denying it, are also controlled by him, as the Internal Controller of one and all and yet, He remains unattached to either of these opposites. This is the supreme truth and its veracity hardly needs questioning.




## 6.3.5
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கைதவம் செம்மை கருமை வெளுமையும் ஆய்  
மெய் பொய் இளமை முதுமை புதுமை பழமையும் ஆய்  
செய்த திண் மதிள் சூழ் திருவிண்ணகர் சேர்ந்த பிரான்  
பெய்த காவு கண்டீர் பெரும் தேவு உடை மூவுலகே

kaitavam cemmai karumai veḷumaiyum āy  
mey poy iḷamai mutumai putumai paḻamaiyum āy  
ceyta tiṇ matiḷ cūḻ tiruviṇṇakar cērnta pirāṉ  
peyta kāvu kaṇṭīr perum tēvu uṭai mūvulakē

**English translation of verse 6.3.5:**

The triple worlds where reside the exalted Devas (Brahmā and others)  
Are but the orchards raised by the benevolent Lord in Tiruviṇṇakar,  
With its ramparts, robust and lovely, who directs  
Truth and falsehood, the sneaky and the erect,  
The young and the old, old and new, black and white.

**Notes:**

\(i\) From Brahmā down to the smallest insect, all are His wards, without distinction of high and low. Some are forthright and straightforward while there are others who are nothing but crooked and who can never be erect in word, deed or thought. Well, all these are controlled by the Supreme Lord who also combines in Himself these contrary traits. For instance, as Kṛṣṇa, the cowherd boy. He would search for His missing calf inside the butter pots while, as Śrī Rāma, He wouldn’t mind speaking out the bare truth even to a demoness like Sūrpanakhā who met Him at Pañcavaṭi and enquired about Him.

\(ii\) *Black and white*: The Lord incarnated as Balarāma, of white Complexion and as Kṛṣṇa, of black complexion. When they moved, side by side, it looked as if a black mountain followed a white mountain.

\(ii\) *Truth and falsehood*: As Śrī Rāma, the Lord was the great apostle of truth while, as Śrī Kṛṣṇa, He was a bundle of apparent contradictions, truthful unto the devout and the opposite of it to the otherwise.

\(iv\) *The young and the old*: The ageless Lord incarnated as a Babe, still retaining His stature as the Primate, the oldest of all (Purāṇa Puruṣa).

\(v\) *Old and New*: Ageless and hence old He, no doubt, is but, all the same, He retains the youthful freshness, exhilarating beyond measure.




## 6.3.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மூவுலகங்களும் ஆய் அல்லன் ஆய் உகப்பு ஆய் முனிவு ஆய்  
பூவில் வாழ் மகள் ஆய் தவ்வை ஆய் புகழ் ஆய் பழி ஆய்  
தேவர் மேவித் தொழும் திருவிண்ணகர் சேர்ந்த பிரான்  
பாவியேன் மனத்தே உறைகின்ற பரஞ்சுடரே.

mūvulakaṅkaḷum āy allaṉ āy ukappu āy muṉivu āy  
pūvil vāḻ makaḷ āy tavvai āy pukaḻ āy paḻi āy  
tēvar mēvit toḻum tiruviṇṇakar cērnta pirāṉ  
pāviyēṉ maṉattē uṟaikiṉṟa parañcuṭarē.

**English translation of verse 6.3.6:**

The resplendent Lord Supreme Who, in this sinner’s mind resides  
And in Him combines the eternal Heaven and the ephemeral worlds,  
Likes and dislikes, the Goddess of affluence and her number opposite;  
Fame and opprobrium, stays in Tiruviṇṇakar, the Celestials’ resort favourite.

### Notes

\(i\) The three worlds, with their strange admixture of Satva, Rajas and Tamas, with their inhabitants, bound down by their actions, past and present, liable to dissolution, as well as the Eternal Land (Heaven) in contra-distinction to the Sportive Universe, referred to above, are controlled by the Supreme Lord.

\(ii\) A thing, liked by some, is disliked by some others; the same person might like a thing at one time and dislike it at another. Some are affluent, being the recipients of Lakṣmī’s grace, while others are oppressed by chill penury, due to the lack of such grace. Some are praise worthy while there are others who are condemned as despicable. All these are controlled by the Lord; while He is extolled by the devout, He is condemned by the demoniac.

\(iii\) The Saint calls himself a sinner, recollecting how, in the earlier decad, he had the cheek, the impudence to shut the door against the Lord, when He presented Himself.




## 6.3.7
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

பரம் சுடர் உடம்பு ஆய் அழுக்குப் பதித்த உடம்பு ஆய்  
கரந்தும் தோன்றியும் நின்றும் கைதவங்கள் செய்தும் விண்ணோர்-  
சிரங்களால் வணங்கும் திருவிண்ணகர் சேர்ந்த பிரான்  
வரம் கொள் பாதம் அல்லால் இல்லை யாவர்க்கும் வன் சரணே.

param cuṭar uṭampu āy aḻukkup patitta uṭampu āy  
karantum tōṉṟiyum niṉṟum kaitavaṅkaḷ ceytum viṇṇōr-  
ciraṅkaḷāl vaṇaṅkum tiruviṇṇakar cērnta pirāṉ  
varam koḷ pātam allāl illai yāvarkkum vaṉ caraṇē.

**English translation of verse 6.3.7:**

Refuge, safe and sound, for each and every one,  
There’s naught but the glorious feet of the puzzling Lord,  
Who’s both the mundane and the ultra-mundane, hidden and open,  
And stays in Tiruviṇṇakar where Devas come and bow their heads.

### Notes

The entire Universe is the Lord’s body. He also possesses His own unique form (Divya maṅgala vigraha), the aprākṛta (ultra mundane) and *Śuddha Satva* (impeccable purity).

He sustains all things and beings, hidden inside them as their Internal Controller; He also comes out in the open as Śrī Rāma and Kṛṣṇa. He is transparent to the devotees and hidden to the rest. His feet confer all boons and will not give up the devotees even if the Lord and His Divine Consort Who is grace personified, do give up (a contingency which will, in the very nature of things, never occur). Hence, the Lord’s feet constitute the life refuge for one and all, from the exalted Brahmā down to the meanest creature.




## 6.3.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வன்சரண் சுரர்க்கு ஆய் அசுரர்க்கு வெம் கூற்றமும் ஆய்  
தன்சரண் நிழற்கீழ் உலகம் வைத்தும் வையாதும்  
தென்சரண் திசைக்குத் திருவிண்ணகர் சேர்ந்த பிரான்  
என்சரண் என் கண்ணன் என்னை ஆளுடை என் அப்பனே

vaṉcaraṇ curarkku āy acurarkku vem kūṟṟamum āy  
taṉcaraṇ niḻaṟkīḻ ulakam vaittum vaiyātum  
teṉcaraṇ ticaikkut tiruviṇṇakar cērnta pirāṉ  
eṉcaraṇ eṉ kaṇṇaṉ eṉṉai āḷuṭai eṉ appaṉē

**English translation of verse 6.3.8:**

In Tiruviṇṇakar, the Refuge of the southerly direction, stays  
Kaṇṇaṉ, my Liege-Lord, my sole Refuge, the Devas haven safe,  
The deadly opponent of the Asuras, Who caresses under His feet  
And shelters the devout and leaves others in scorching heat.

### Notes

\(i\) The Lord is known to be absolutely impartial and yet, whenever the Devas are tormented by the Asuras, the former seek refuge in Him and He engages Himself in a pitched battle against the Asuras and vanquishes them. There is, however, no inconsistency, if looked at in the manner indicated below.

\(ii\) In the tanks dug by charitable men, one man allays his thirst, while another drowns himself of death. The lamp is there to shed light during nights and make our movements easy. But then, the winged ants rush in and die. The Lord, by Himself, is not overzealous in protecting the Devas or hell-bent to put down the Asuras but none can help the latter category if they court destruction, as in the instances cited here.

\(iii\) Unto those, who seek Him as the Sole Refuge, He grants cool shelter and makes them forgot all their erstwhile miseries. On the other hand, those who stray away from Him and run after the sensual pleasures, like unto trying to quench one’s thirst by swallowing the blazing flame or reposing under the shade cast by the swinging hood of the Cobra, are left severely alone, to wither away.




## 6.3.9
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

என் அப்பன் எனக்கு ஆய் இகுள் ஆய் என்னைப் பெற்றவள் ஆய்  
பொன் அப்பன் மணி அப்பன் முத்து அப்பன் அன் அப்பனும் ஆய்  
மின்னப் பொன் மதிள் சூழ் திருவிண்ணகர் சேர்ந்த அப்பன்  
தன் ஒப்பார் இல் அப்பன் தந்தனன் தன தாள் நிழலே. (2)

eṉ appaṉ eṉakku āy ikuḷ āy eṉṉaip peṟṟavaḷ āy  
poṉ appaṉ maṇi appaṉ muttu appaṉ aṉ appaṉum āy  
miṉṉap poṉ matiḷ cūḻ tiruviṇṇakar cērnta appaṉ  
taṉ oppār il appaṉ tantaṉaṉ taṉa tāḷ niḻalē. (2)

**English translation of verse 6.3.9:**

The peerless Lord Who unto me is Father, Mate and Mother,  
All combined, my Sire, like gold, ruby and pearl put together,  
Stays in Tiruviṇṇakar with its golden ramparts all around,  
Me, He has under the cool shade of His feet grounded.

### Notes

\(i\) The great Sages have proclaimed: “Vāsudeva tharucchāyā nāthi śīthā na gharmadhā...,” that is, the shade of Vāsudeva, the gigantic tree, is most soothing and refreshing, it prevents entry into hell and is, therefore, worth getting into. Such a shade has been granted to Saint Nammāḻvār by the Lord of His own accord in His spontaneous Grace. This great benefaction of the Lord is being extolled by the Saint in this song. By the shade of the Lord is actually meant service unto Him in His immediate presence.

\(ii\) In the world around, the Father is distinct from the Mother and the Mother is distinct from the Mate. The combination of all these different functionaries in one and the same person, is not possible except in God Who is unique in all respects. So also, Gold serves a certain purpose, the ruby serves yet another purpose and the peari, a third, but one can secure all these benefits from the Lord alone, who is ‘All in one’.




## 6.3.10
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நிழல் வெய்யில் சிறுமை பெருமை குறுமை நெடுமையும் ஆய்  
சுழல்வன நிற்பன மற்றும் ஆய் அவை அல்லனும் ஆய்  
மழலை வாய் வண்டு வாழ் திருவிண்ணகர் மன்னு பிரான்  
கழல்கள் அன்றி மற்றோர் களைகண் இலம் காண்மின்களே

niḻal veyyil ciṟumai perumai kuṟumai neṭumaiyum āy  
cuḻalvaṉa niṟpaṉa maṟṟum āy avai allaṉum āy  
maḻalai vāy vaṇṭu vāḻ tiruviṇṇakar maṉṉu pirāṉ  
kaḻalkaḷ aṉṟi maṟṟōr kaḷaikaṇ ilam kāṇmiṉkaḷē

**English translation of verse 6.3.10:**

Take it on oath, Saviour we have none but the feet  
Of the Lord, who resides in Tiruviṇṇakar where go gay  
The lisping bees, Who is at once, short and tall, shade and heat,  
Things still and mobile and all else but to them attached, in no way.

### Notes

In every centum of this great work, there is a decad which is addressed by the Saint to the world at large, wherein he preaches the Supremacy of God, His amazing simplicity etc. So then, this is the crucial decad in this centum, conveying the golden message to the people that the feet of the Lord, enshrined in Tiruviṇṇakar constitute our sole Refuge.

The Lord is said to combine in Him all these contraries, the cool shade and the scorching heat, the smallest and the biggest, still, mobile and what not, as the entire universe, the created worlds with their vast varieties, constitutes His body and yet, He will not partake of these qualities.




## 6.3.11
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

காண்மின்கள் உலகீர்! என்று கண்முகப்பே நிமிர்ந்த  
தாள் இணையன் தன்னைக் குருகூர்ச் சடகோபன் சொன்ன  
ஆணை ஆயிரத்துத் திருவிண்ணகர்ப் பத்தும் வல்லார்  
கோணை இன்றி விண்ணோர்க்கு என்றும் ஆவர் குரவர்களே. (2)

kāṇmiṉkaḷ ulakīr! eṉṟu kaṇmukappē nimirnta  
tāḷ iṇaiyaṉ taṉṉaik kurukūrc caṭakōpaṉ coṉṉa  
āṇai āyirattut tiruviṇṇakarp pattum vallār  
kōṇai iṉṟi viṇṇōrkku eṉṟum āvar kuravarkaḷē. (2)

**English translation of verse 6.3.11:**

Those that are well-versed in these songs ten, out of the thousand,  
Composed by Caṭakōpaṉ of Kurukūr, at the Lord’s command,  
Pointing to the worldlings, right in front, the Lord’s towering feet,  
Will for unreserved admiration by the Celestials become fit

### Notes

\(i\) The Dramiḍa (Tamil) Vedas, like the Sanskrit Vedas convey the Lord’s command—‘Śrutis Smṛtir mamaivājñā.’

\(ii\) Those that are well-versed in these ten songs will compel the unreserved admiration of the ‘Nitya Sūrīs’ (the Ever-free Angels) in Heaven and command their respect, that even these people, dwelling in the dark land of nescience, are enjoying the Lord so well.
