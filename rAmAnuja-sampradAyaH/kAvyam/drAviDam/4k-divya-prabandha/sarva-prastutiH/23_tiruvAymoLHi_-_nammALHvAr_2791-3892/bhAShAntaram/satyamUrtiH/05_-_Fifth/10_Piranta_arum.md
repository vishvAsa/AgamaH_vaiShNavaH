## 00 Intro5.10
Unable to reach the holy place of Tiruvallavāḻ, the Āḻvār contemplated the Lord enshrined there, from the outskirts of the holy city, as we saw in the last decad. The Saint thought, he would sustain himself by meditating on Lord Govinda’s (Kṛṣṇa’s) auspicious traits but it made him thaw down. And so, he prays unto the Lord in this decad to grant him at least the stamina to contemplate His glory and sustain himself, even if He would not oblige him with His company. For this purpose, he turns to the Lord in His Incarnate Form (Vibhava), having failed to realise his longing for communion with the Lord in His Area (iconic) Form, in successive pilgrim centres.

On the face of it, the Āḻvār would appear to be moving in the reverse gear. The Lord’s Area (Workshippable) Form is intended to overcome the formidable handicaps and obstacles that confront one in worshipping Him in any of His other aspects of ‘Para’, ‘Vyūha’, Vibhava’ and ‘Antaryāmi’. And yet, the Alvar has recourse to the Lord’s Incarnations, overlooking the time-lag, for the simple reason that the devotees could mingle with the Lord freely, converse and embrace during His Avatāras, unlike the ‘Arca’ where such exchanges are not possible, resulting in the Āḻvār’s frustration. Even among the Incarnations it is noteworthy that all the Āḻvārs had a partiality for Kṛṣṇa. The illustrious Parāśara Bhaṭṭar explained this special preference, as follows:

The grief caused by one’s bereavement loses its intensity with the passage of time, while the pangs are very acute when it is fresh. To the Āḻvārs, Kṛṣṇāvatāra was the nearest in point of time and hence, their lamentations. In the case of Saint Nammāḻvār, in particular, he missed the Kṛṣṇāvatāra by a bare six weeks. Tradition has it that he came into this world just forty three days after Lord Kṛṣṇa’s ascension to the Celestium. The Āḻvār cursed himself as a sinner, born six weeks late, missing the Kṛṣṇāvatāra like unto a delicious dish hitting the teeth and falling to the ground, while attempting to eat it. It was as if Kṛṣṇa had left the pastoral township of Tiruvāyppāṭi by the North gate even as the Āḻvār was entering the place by the South gate.




## 5.10.1
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

பிறந்த ஆறும் வளர்ந்த ஆறும் பெரிய பாரதம் கைசெய்து ஐவர்க்குத்-  
திறங்கள் காட்டியிட்டுச் செய்து போன மாயங்களும்  
நிறம் தன் ஊடு புக்கு எனது ஆவியை நின்று நின்று உருக்கி உண்கின்ற இச்-  
சிறந்தவான் சுடரே! உன்னை என்றுகொல் சேர்வதுவே! (2)

niṟam taṉ ūṭu pukku eṉatu āviyai niṉṟu niṉṟu urukki uṇkiṉṟa ic-  
ciṟantavāṉ cuṭarē! uṉṉai eṉṟukol cērvatuvē! (2)

**English translation of verse 5.10.1:**

Oh, Lord of radiance beyond measure, The manner of Your birth,  
The manner You grew up, Your wondrous military strategy  
In the great battle of Bhārata leading the five to victory,  
And Your return to Celestium thereafter, all these, taking one’s breath,  
Get into the vital region of my heart, sapping my soul  
All the time; when indeed will You be joined by this vassal?

### Note

After briefly touching upon the Lord’s Avatāra as Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the Āḻvār deplores his inability to remain steady and recount His wonderful deeds, as they send him into a trance, touching as they do the inner core of his being. As a matter of fact, even as he contemplated the manner of the Lord’s birth as Kṛṣṇa, entering the mother’s womb as we, bound souls do, he fell into a trance which lasted six months. This song did not, therefore, progress beyond the opening phrase, ‘the manner of Your birth’ (as in the original text), for six months. Then again, he was struck by the way Kṛṣṇa grew up, how He was shifted from the place of birth the same night and brought up by a different set of parents, under cover, the odds and ends He had to contend against, right from infancy, the many miracles He wrought in the battle that ensued between the Pāṇḍavas and Kauravas, after His peace-parleys proved abortive, His functioning as Arujuna’s charioteer and so on. Briefly put, in the inimitable language of Īṭu, the way Kaṇṇaṉ grew up was precisely the way the inimical ones were made to eat the dust and the friendly ones drank deep of His nectarean charm (a continual feast for their eyes), gobbling up ghee and other milk products stored up in the pastoral township of Tiruvāyppāṭi (Gokula).




## 5.10.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வதுவை வார்த்தையுள் ஏறு பாய்ந்ததும் மாய மாவினை வாய் பிளந்ததும்  
மதுவை வார் குழலார் குரவை பிணைந்த குழகும்  
அது இது உது என்னலாவன அல்ல என்னை உன் செய்கை நைவிக்கும்  
முது வைய முதல்வா! உன்னை என்று தலைப்பெய்வனே?

vatuvai vārttaiyuḷ ēṟu pāyntatum māya māviṉai vāy piḷantatum  
matuvai vār kuḻalār kuravai piṇainta kuḻakum  
atu itu utu eṉṉalāvaṉa alla eṉṉai uṉ ceykai naivikkum  
mutu vaiya mutalvā! uṉṉai eṉṟu talaippeyvaṉē?

**English translation of verse 5.10.2:**

Oh, Primate, your wondrous deeds do description baffle  
And make me thaw down; pounce you did upon the bulls  
When the talk of your wedding (Nappiṉṉai) was on,  
The mouth of the treacherous fiend, horse-shaped, you tore open,  
Dance you did merrily in the sweet company  
Of those damsels whose locks shed plenty of honey;  
When can I your lovely feet attain?

### Note

The moment the challenging task of taming the seven unruly bulls, all at once, was set up as a pre-condition by the fair Nappiṉṉai’s father for winning her hand, Kṛṣṇa dashed forward and pounced upon the animals, killing them all. Again, when Kṛṣṇa was in the company of the Gopis, a demon in the disguise of a horse came running fiercely to trample upon Him, but, with perfect case, He tore open the longish mouth of the treacherous horse and put an end to it. And then, there was the classical ‘Rāsa Krīḍa’ in which Kṛṣṇa assumed many forms and stood beside each Gopi, vide detailed notes given earlier about this *wonderful wonder of wonders*. There is hardly any need to single out any one of His many deeds. Each and every one of His deeds sends the Āḻvār into raptures and sweeps him off his feet. And so, he prays that he may at least have the requisite stamina to sustain and steady himself, recount the Lord’s glory and revel in it without breaking down.




## 5.10.3
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

பெய்யும் பூங் குழல் பேய் முலை உண்ட பிள்ளைத் தேற்றமும் பேர்ந்து ஓர் சாடு இறச்-

**English translation of verse 5.10.3:**

The innocent looks on Your infant face as You sucked  
The devil’s breast, the juvenile valour of Your foot red that kicked  
The demon in the wheel, the fright You displayed with tears  
In Your lotus eyes, when, before You, Your mother did appear  
With stick in hand, to question You about stealing butter,  
All these now do I in my mind envision, making it melt down!

### Notes

\(i\) The infant looks of the Babe reveal His innocence, the inability to distinguish between the real mother and the Imposter.

\(ii\) The Babe had pinching hunger and cried for the mother’s breast-milk, casually kicking the cart-wheel. But then, what a mighty kick it was and, that too, just from one foot of the tender Babe! The wheel broke into bits and with it, the demon who had taken possession of it-Juvenile valour indeed!




## 5.10.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கள்ள வேடத்தைக் கொண்டு போய் புரம்புக்க ஆறும் கலந்து அசுரரை-

**English translation of verse 5.10.4:**

The form dubious You assumed (as Buddha) oh Lord!  
And entry into the citadels three manoeuvred.  
Mingling freely with the Asuras, their outlook You altered  
And got them annihilated; (Śiva), with Gangā on matted locks  
In close unison with You, I behold and in my mind locked  
Are all these, making my soul just melt down.

### Notes

\(i\) The Āḻvār characterises the advent of Buddha as a mask put on by Lord Viṣṇu, in order to sow the seeds of doubt, dissension and heresy among the Asuras (who were very powerful, by dint of their rigorous rituals, but most unscrupulous and destructive), with a view to reducing their prowess and strength and getting them annihilated thereby. The story of Buddha, as recorded in the third Aṃśa of Śrī Viṣṇu Purāṇa, is as follows:

Once upon a time, the Asuras invoked Śiva by their rigorous austerities and when he appeared before them and enquired of them what they wished to have, they asked for three cities, invulnerable to attack from any source. While granting their wish, Śiva warned that the cities should always move in the air without touching each other and if ever they chanced to collide, great misfortune would befall them. The three cities, one made of iron, another of silver and the third of gold, came into existence forthwith. Living in these flying citadels, the demons waged war against the Devas and the Brahmins who offered libations to the latter. Deprived of the sacrificial offerings from the Brahmins, the strength of the Devas dwindled and they fell an easy prey to the Asuras. When requested by the Devas to destroy the Asuras who posted themselves with their flying citadels at all places where sacrifices were performed, molested and slew the performers, Śiva declined to fell the three, he himself had planted, even if it be poisonous. Thereafter, the Devas went with their tale of woe to Viṣṇu, resting on the Milky ocean and begged of Him to destroy the demons. Queried by the Lord whether the Devas and the Brahmins could not, with their combined might, destroy the demons, the Devas clarified that the Asuras were invincible because they too performed rites and rituals and sacrifices and gained strength, all the time.

Assuring the Devas that He would destroy the demons, the Lord proceeded to the cities of the demons, disguised as an aged Buddha (wise man), carrying a book under his arm and wearing a twisted Kuśā grass round his finger, ring-like. He preached to them morals in a telling manner, and they had nc hesitation in adopting Him as their mentor (wise counsellor). When they began performing some Yāga (ceremonies), Buddha accosted them: “What are these sticks for?” Pat came the reply, “For offering into the fire”, evoking the observation from Buddha that it was better to be born a grass-eating cow than a stick-eating fire. Likewise, Buddha enquired the purpose for which huge stocks of food had been kept in the venue of the Yāga. When He was told that it was all meant to be offered to the Gods, He spoke derisively that it would be nice to do so if they could satisfy the hunger of a traveller by feeding some one at home. Buddha asked next why the goats were kept there and elicited the reply that the omentum extracted from the animals would be offered to the Gods. Buddha remarked, “Oh, ḷ see, butchers seem to be the righteous people then!” By means of such preachings, Buddha succeeded in cajoling the demons and with their faith in the sacrifices and their efficacy shaken, they gave them up altogether. They even began to revile Śiva, their great benefactor, and this reached his ears through Buddha. The irate Śiva resolved to destroy the ungrateful demons. In the battle that ensued, the Earth became the chariot, the sun and Moon, its wheels, the four vedas were the horses, Brahmā, the charioteer, Mahā-Meru, the mountain was used as the bow and Ādiśeṣa, the bow-string. Thus equipped, the vile demons were exterminated by Śiva. The old order of things was restored whereby the Devas and the Brahmins could live in peace, the latter providing the former with their usual sacrificial offerings.

The authoritative texts (Mahā Bhārata, Karṇa parva) declare ‘Viṣṇurātmā Bhagavato bhavasyāmita tejasaḥ’ and true to this, Śiva could conquer the demons only through Lord Viṣṇu, his Internal Controller. This is precisely what the Āḻvār intends to convey when he refers to Śiva standing in close unison with the Lord. This Buddha should not, however, be confounded with Śāṅkhya Muni (Gautama), born about 2,500 years ago.

\(ii\) Read also the arguments, Sage Jābāli advanced in Rāmāyaṇa (11-108), to induce Śrī Rāma to get back to the Kingdom, giving up the exile imposed on Him by His father. Śrī Rāma had, however, no hesitation in castigating the sage for his specious advice, wide apart from Dharma, about which Śrī Rāma had a very clear conception.

\(iii\) The accord of Śiva with Viṣṇu, referred to here, denotes the intimate relationship between the two, as Body and Soul respectively, the latter being the ‘Antarātmā’ or the Inner Soul of the former. It is worth recalling, in this connection, the dialogue between Kūratāḻvāṉ and king Krimikaṇṭa cōla in the Royal Court. When the king insisted that Kūratāḻvāṉ should subscribe to the bull that Śiva is the Supreme Truth, Āḻvāṉ pointed out, quoting chapter and verse, that Śiva derived all the power he had only from the Paramount Lord of the Cosmos, Viṣṇu. Āḻvāṉ would not sign the order, as commanded by the King and chose to submit himself to the inquisitorial torture of the bigoted king. (“Blessed are they that suffer persecution for the sake of justice, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven”.—*Bible*)

**Tamil text and transliteration:**

உண்ண வானவர் கோனுக்கு ஆயர் ஒருப்படுத்த அடிசில் உண்டதும்  
வண்ண மால் வரையை எடுத்து மழை காத்தலும்

**English translation of verse 5.10.5:**

Like wax set on fire, my mind does melt  
Whenever I meditate on the Lord’s wondrous deeds  
How He consumed all the food by the cowherds set  
Unto Devas’ chief, how He did the rains repel,  
Holding the lovely mount aloft, how, in the days of old,  
He did the worlds create, ate and spat, spanned and pulled  
Them out of the waters deep and did (Mother Earth) wed.

### Note

The Āḻvār says that his mind thaws down in contemplation of the Lord’s wondrous deeds, those performed for the general weal of the Universe, as well as specially directed towards the amelioration of His ardent devotees.




## 5.10.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நின்ற ஆறும் இருந்த ஆறும்/ கிடந்த ஆறும் நினைப்பு அரியன  
ஒன்று அலா உருவு ஆய் அருவு ஆய நின் மாயங்கள்  
நின்று நின்று நினைக்கின்றேன் உன்னை எங்ஙனம் நினைகிற்பன் பாவியேற்கு-

**English translation of verse 5.10.6:**

### Translation

The manner in which You stood in one place, sat in another. And reposed in yet another, these and several other  
Wonders indefinable are indeed beyond my mind’s reach,  
Ponder do I over them little by little; You, I beseech,  
Oh, resplendent Lord, Who the worlds once gulped down,  
To grant this sinner, strength to meditate without wearing down

### Note

\(i\) The places where the Lord stood, sat and reposed, not having been specified in this Song, the Ācāryas take delight in interpreting this in a number of ways, as elucidated below:

> I Standing
>
> (*Incarnate Forms*)
>
> Śrī Rāma *standing* at the entrance to Laṅka with bow in hand;  
> The victorious Rāma *standing* with bow in hand after slaying Vāli;  
> Śrī Kṛṣṇa *standing*, holding mount Govardhan aloft;  
> Śrī Kṛṣṇa *standing* inside the cradle, holding on to the side-rods;
>
> (*Iconic Form*)
>
> Standing
>
> In Mount *Tiruveṅkaṭam. Ūrakam, Śrī Vaikuṇṭa [Vaikunṭam]* etc.
>
> II\. Sitting
>
> (*Incarnate Forms*)
>
> Śrī Rāma *sitting* in *citrakūṭ* and other places; Śrī Kṛṣṇa *sitting*
> in the cradle, unable to stand any longer.
>
> (*Transcendent Form*)
>
> *Sitting* in the High Heavens on the Serpent-Couch.
>
> (*Iconic Form*)
>
> Sitting in *Pāṭakaṃ, Varakuṇamaṅkai* etc.;
>
> III\. Reposing
>
> \(i\) *Incarnate Forms*
>
> Śrī Rāma. *reposing*, in front of the ocean;  
> Śrī Kṛṣṇa *reposing* on the laps of the Gopīs, just before the
> commencement of Rāsakrīḍā;  
> Śrī Kṛṣṇa reposing in the cradle, as a tender Babe,
>
> \(ii\) *Vyūḥa*
>
> The Lord *reposing* in the Milky-ocean. in Yoga Niddhrā;
>
> \(iii\) *Iconic Form*
>
> *Reposing* in *Tiruvekkā, Puḷiṅkuṭi, Tirukkuṭanta.
> Śrīraṅgaṃ-Anantaśayanam* etc.

\(ii\) Although the Incarnations took place long ago, it should still be possible to meditate on them even at this distance of time. But the wondrous deeds of the Lord are too numerous to be narrated, with any degree of cogency and precision and, in the case of the Āḻvār, he is unable to study himself and recount them without wearing down. And hence, the prayer, as in this song.

\(iii\) The Lord’s wondrous deeds and the different postures assumed by Him at various centres, have been mentioned here by the Āḻvār, only to stress His gracious response to the devotees who give their hearts to Him. It would, therefore, be relevant to cite the following anecdote to illustrate the manner and extent of the Lord’s approach to us, when we will but take one step towards Him.

A certain devotee, proficient in singing, came all the way to Śrīraṅgam from the far north, longing to worship Lord Raṅganātha. When he went to the temple, it was the concluding day of a certain festival. Āḻvār Tiruvaraṅkapperumāḷ Araiyar, the Temple Bard, chanted a hymn of Tonṭaraṭippoṭi Āḻvār before Lord Raṅganātha with great feeling and literally coaxed the Lord's pleasure. The Lord was highly pleased with His Minstrel and seemed readily inclined to do the latter’s bidding. At this ripe moment, the Araiyar introduced the devout visitor from the North, who had covered, on foot, more than two thousand miles, and prayed for the Lord’s condescension to honour the visitor with a special recognition of his great devotion unto Him. The Lord immediately responded by walking four paces of a rod length each (uyyāra naṭai) in the hands of His holy bearers, from the laurel tree in the cloisters of the temple. Addressing the Holy choir, the Lord enquired: “Come, Ye, holy chanters, tell us whether what we have done is adequate to the pains taken by this northern supplicant of ours”. Here then is the tradition highlighting the truth that, when man ascends to the God’s foot-stool, God descends to the soul of man.




## 5.10.7
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஒண் சுடரோடு இருளுமாய் நின்ற ஆறும் உண்மையோடு இன்மையாய் வந்து என்-  
கண் கொளாவகை நீ கரந்து என்னைச் செய்கின்றன  
எண் கொள் சிந்தையுள் நைகின்றேன் என் கரிய மாணிக்கமே! என் கண்கட்குத்-  
திண் கொள்ள ஒரு நாள் அருளாய் உன் திரு உருவே.

tiṇ koḷḷa oru nāḷ aruḷāy uṉ tiru uruvē.

**English translation of verse 5.10.7:**

My Lord of sapphire hue, with all radiance You shine  
In my heart and yet, outside You aren’t seen.  
And ‘tis darkness indeed; ‘tween such contradictions torn,  
I ponder which is true and which is false and dwindle;  
Once in a way let me see Your Form tangible.

### Note

The Āḻvār prays unto the Lord who has blest him with perpetual light inside, the glorious mental vision of the Divine, to make Himself perceptible to the external senses as well, at least once in a way. The Lord does exist for the devout and sheds light on them while He does not exist so far as the sceptical unbelievers are concerned and nonexistence of God is but synonymous with darkness or blindness. For the conflicting individuals these contradictions do exist.




## 5.10.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

திரு உருவு கிடந்த ஆறும் கொப்பூழ்ச் செந்தாமரைமேல் திசைமுகன்-  
கருவுள் வீற்றிருந்து படைத்திட்ட கருமங்களும்  
பொரு இல் உன் தனி நாயகம் அவை கேட்கும்தோறும் என் நெஞ்சம் நின்று நெக்கு  
அருவி சோரும் கண்ணீர் என் செய்கேன் அடியேனே!

aruvi cōrum kaṇṇīr eṉ ceykēṉ aṭiyēṉē!

**English translation of verse 5.10.8:**

Your exquisite form in repose (on the Milk-ocean),  
The emergence, from the lotus stalk on your navel, of (Brahmā) Ticaimukaṉ,  
For the creation of the worlds, pervaded by you as Internal Controller,  
All these proclaiming your glory peerless, I hear (the Vedantins utter),  
My mind melting down in ecstasy and into torrential tears  
Do my eyes break; oh, how can this vassal hold up?

**Note**

The Āḻvār is simply overwhelmed by the Lord’s transcendent glory and, in an unsteady frame of mind charged with great emotion, he is unable to do any sustained thinking, clear and cogent.




## 5.10.9
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அடியை மூன்றை இரந்த ஆறும் அங்கே நின்று ஆழ் கடலும் மண்ணும் விண்ணும்-  
முடிய ஈர் அடியால் முடித்துக்கொண்ட முக்கியமும்  
நொடியுமாறு அவை கேட்கும்தோறும் என் நெஞ்சம் நின் தனக்கே கரைந்து உகும்  
கொடிய வல்வினையேன் உன்னை என்றுகொல் கூடுவதே?

**English translation of verse 5.10.9:**

Your great glory by the devout recounted, I do hear.  
How You (from Bali) sought land of three strides.  
The unique valour with which You did cover  
The Earth, the ocean deep and the Heaven, in two strides  
And my mind, in You absorbed, thaws down; sinner heavy  
That I am, when will ḷ on You meditate, calm and steady?




## 5.10.10
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கூடி நீரைக் கடைந்த ஆறும் அமுதம் தேவர் உண்ண அசுரரை-  
வீடும் வண்ணங்களே செய்து போன வித்தகமும்  
ஊடு புக்கு எனது ஆவியை உருக்கி உண்டிடுகின்ற நின் தன்னை-  
நாடும் வண்ணம் சொல்லாய் நச்சு நாகு அணையானே!

ūṭu pukku eṉatu āviyai urukki uṇṭiṭukiṉṟa niṉ taṉṉai-  
nāṭum vaṇṇam collāy naccu nāku aṇaiyāṉē!

**English translation of verse 5.10.10:**

Oh, Lord on serpent-bed, the way You churned the Milky ocean,  
In conjunction with Devas and Asuras but gave the nectar  
To Devas alone, keeping Asuras away, deep into my Soul enters  
This scheming wonder of yours and waters it down;  
Say how I can Your glory contemplate without breaking down.

### Note

The fickle-minded Asuras gave up their bid for the nectar that came from the Milky ocean, when they beheld Lord Viṣṇu’s Mohinī Avatāra of ravishing feminine charm and ran after the strange Visitor. Contemplating this wonderful sequence of events, the Āḻvār thaws down in wonderment and prays that he should be enabled to meditate on Him with that steadiness with which Ādiśeṣa serves Him. Reference to the Lord’s serpent-bed is thus quite significant.




## 5.10.11
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நாகு அணைமிசை நம் பிரான் சரணே சரண் நமக்கு என்று நாள்தொறும்-  
ஏக சிந்தையனாய்க் குருகூர்ச் சடகோபன் மாறன்  
ஆக நூற்ற அந்தாதி ஆயிரத்துள் இவையும் ஓர் பத்தும் வல்லார்  
மாக வைகுந்தத்து மகிழ்வு எய்துவர் வைகலுமே.

āka nūṟṟa antāti āyirattuḷ ivaiyum ōr pattum vallār  
māka vaikuntattu makiḻvu eytuvar vaikalumē.

**English translation of verse 5.10.11:**

Those that chant these songs ten  
Out of the thousand composed by Caṭakōpaṉ  
Of Kurukūr for his edification, with singular devotion  
Unto to the Lord on Serpent-bed, whom he looked upon  
As his sole refuge, will enjoy bliss eternal in high heaven.

### Note

Ādiśeṣa, the Lord's couch *cum* bed will not allow the Lord to give up the supplicants and therefore it is that the Āḻvār seeks to take advantage of this favourable combination.




## Retrospective Summary
(5-1): The Āḻvār draws the searchlight inward, to discover the root-cause of the extraordinary grace showered on him by the Lord, whereby he could not merely stand apart from the worldlings, without wallowing as one of them but also advise and correct them. Finding, however, that, even for a mere show of piety, devoid of genuine love for him, the Lord has condescended to open up the flood-gates of His grace on him, without caring in the least to go beneath the skin and expose his hollowness, the Āḻvār just marvels, *in the opening decad of this Centum*, at the Lord’s overwhelming grace and gives vent to his wonderment;

(5-2): The Āḻvār having weaned the people from propitiating minor deities, through his splended exposition of the supremacy of Mahāviṣṇu in IV-10, this abode has now become a land of bliss, hardly distinguishable from Heaven. A golden era has thus been ushered in here, attracting ever the denizens of the upper worlds to this land, to behold and admire this new state of affairs. It is such an exhilarating milieu that the Alvar hails, *in the second decad*, besides envisioning the advent of Tirumaṅkai Āḻvār and Saint Rāmānuja, in the days to come, the veritable destroyers of the ungodly forces of Kaliyuga;

(5-3): Reverting to the ‘Nāyaki’ state, which obtained during the three consecutive decads (6 to 8) of the fourth Centum, the Āḻvār is seen, *in the third decad*, all agog to get united with the Lord or at least procure from Him the tuḷaci garland and wear it on her locks. Non-fulfilment of her intense longing, however, induces her to contemplate the drastic step of embarking on what is known as ‘Maṭal’ in Tamil literature, that is, coming into the open and carrying her tale of woe to the public at large, so that the cruelly unresponsive Lord could be arraigned at the bar of public opinion and the union with Him got accelerated.

(5-4): In order to put through the proceedings, contemplated in the preceding decad, the Nāyakī has to, first of all, draw a sketch of her lover (the accused), for public exhibition. But it is pitch dark and she cannot draw the picture. It is an unusually long night, dark and dewy. The whole world is fast asleep and the Nāyakī has no company. Against this background, the Nāyakī is seen, *in the fourth decad*, having recourse to the contemplation of the Lord’s auspicious traits, soothing her aching heart;

(5-5): *The fifth decad* is sung by the Āḻvār, while still in the feminine state. The Sun having risen, at long last, the Nāyakī could enjoy, in her mind’s eye, the glorious vision of the Lord, in His Iconic Form at Tirukkuṟuṅkuṭi (also known as Vaiṣṇava Vāmana Kṣetra). The elders, who tried to bring the Nāyakī round, by admonishing her, are hit back by her, questioning the propriety of their admonishing one whose heart stands rivetted to the exquisite Form of the Lord at Tirukkuṟuṅkuṭi;

(5-6): The gnostic mother finds Parāṅkuśa Nāyaki (Āḻvār), seated like a discourser, with the fingers in an instructional pose and declaring that she had created the whole world, that she would become the world herself and so on. Queried by her kinsmen, the bewildered mother says that the Nāyakī is perhaps possessed by the Supreme Lord, who is the Inner Self of all beings. Every song *in the sixth decad* is in two distinct parts, namely, the narration of the Nāyakī’s God-vision (Man identified with God), followed by the mother’s suggestion that it is perhaps God who has taken possession of the Nāyakī, that speaks through her;

(5-7): The Lord is still keeping Himself away from the Āḻvār, although, on previous occasions, He obliged the Āḻvār with His presence (mental vision of course), whenever the Āḻvār’s longing for such communion was far-too-intense. Pondering within himself, the Āḻvār apprehends that the Lord might either want him to adopt other means, such as ‘Karma Yoga’, ‘Jñāna Yoga’, and ‘Bhakti Yoga’, or intend to give him up on the ground that he was pursuing other means, instead of looking upon Him as the Sole Means. *In the seventh decad*, the Āḻvār, therefore, hastens to clarify his true stand in this regard, at the feet of the Lord enshrined in Vāṉamāmalai, also known as Cirīvaramaṅkalanakar, deep south in Tamil Nāḍu;

(5-8): In the seventh decad, the Āḻvār fell, like an uprooted tree, at the feet of the Lord enshrined in Vāṉamāmalai and sought refuge and yet, he was not favoured with the Lord’s presence. The Alvar, therefore, turns his attention, *in the eighth decad*, to the Lord gracing Tirukkuṭantai (Kumba-kōṇam in Tamil Nāḍu), hoping that He might be intending to grant him audience at that centre. The Āḻvār is contemplating, with all the fervour at his command, the enchanting prospect of the Lord casting sweet glances at him, conversing with him and gathering him up to his bosom in sweet embrace. The Āḻvār has, however, met with disappointment once again and he ends this decad on a despondent note, exclaiming that he just does not know how many more pilgrim centres he has still to knock at in this manner.

(5-9): *In the ninth decad*, we see a frustrated Āḻvār turning his attention on yet another pilgrim centre, named Tiruvallavāḻ (in Kerala), his coveted union with the Lord at Tirukkuṭantai, not having materialised. Even so, he could not get there, being obsessed with the fragrance wafted across from there, the lovely breeze, the musical drone of the bees humming in the orchards over there, the Vedic chantings, etc. Thus stranded, the Āḻvār assumes the state of Nāyakī and speaks out her infatuation to her mates; (Of course, it is all mental experience and no physical movement, as such, is involved.)

(5-10): *In the concluding decad of this Centum*, the Āḻvār prays unto the Lord to grant him at least the stamina to contemplate His glory and sustain himself, even if He would not oblige him with his company. Having failed to realise his longing for communion with the Lord in His Iconic Form, in successive pilgrim centres, the Alvar turns to the Lord in His incarnate Form, overlooking the time-lag for the simple reason that the devotees could freely mingle with the Lord, during His Incarnations, converse and embrace, unlike the ‘Arca’ (iconic manifestation), where such exchanges are not possible. Even among the Lord’s many incarnations, the Āḻvār has a partiality for the proximate Kṛṣṇāvatār, the manner in which He was born and the way He grew up, touching the inner core of his being and sending him unto a trance.
