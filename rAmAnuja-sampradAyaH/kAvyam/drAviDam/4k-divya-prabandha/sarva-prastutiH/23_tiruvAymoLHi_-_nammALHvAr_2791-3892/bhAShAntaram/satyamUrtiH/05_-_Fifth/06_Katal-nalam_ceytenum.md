## 00 Intro5.6
The Mother finds Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī, seated like a discourser, with the fingers in an instructional pose and declaring that it is she that created the whole world, that she would become the world herself and so on. The bewildered mother, when queried by her kinsmen says that the Nāyakī is perhaps possessed by the Supreme Lord who is the Inner Self of all beings. Every song in this decad is in two distinct parts, namely, the narration of the Nāyakī’s God-vision (man identified with God), followed by the Mother's suggestion that it is perhaps God who has taken possession of the Nāyakī, that speaks through her. There is of course, a parallel for this kind of behaviour of the Nāyakī in Śrī Viṣṇu Purāṇa, V-13-23. In the midst of that rapturous balldance, the classical ‘Rāsakrīḍā’, Lord Kṛṣṇa suddenly withdrew Himself from the Gopīs of Vṛndāvan, who were literally bursting with joy in the company of the Divine cowherd boy, who danced in between every two girls, assuming ubiquity to the extent needed. The Lord’s sudden disappearance was motivated by His desire to stabilise the Gopīs’ God-enjoyment, which was at its highest ebb at that crucial moment, much beyond their capacity to bear. Some time later, He appeared in their midst back again, assuming afar more enchanting Form than before, as if to make amends for the pangs of separation inflicted on them. But what happened to the Gopīs during this interval? They were sunk deep in dejection, expressed by them in immortal songs, known as ‘Gopikā-Gītā’, Some of the Gopīs also resorted to the technique of impersonation of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, so as to sustain themselves, as brought out in the Śloka of Śrī Viṣṇu Purāṇa, referred to above. There was a Gopī claiming to be none other than Kṛṣṇa and calling upon her mates to verify the truth of her statement from her gait.

Another asserted that she was Kṛṣṇa and started playing on the flute; yet another, posing as Kṛṣṇa, addressed a Gopī as:

> “You, deadly snake, stay, or I will kill you”.

That other Gopī deigned to play the role of Kāliyaṉ, the snake, so that she could be smeared with the dust from the feet of Kṛṣṇa (the Gopī simulating Kṛṣṇa). With appropriate gesticulations and a great deal of gusto, a Gopī feigning as Kṛṣṇa, performed feats such as holding Mount Govardhan aloft, slaying of Dhenukāsura and so on. By such means, these Gopis managed to sustain themselves without succumbing to the pangs of separation from Śrī Kṛṣṇa. There is also the example set by Śrī Āṇṭāḷ through her immortal “Tiruppāvai”, the daughter of a high class Brahmin (Viṣṇucitta) adopting, by inclination, the pastoral life of the shepherds and becoming one of them. This provides, therefore, the key to this decad.

**English translation of verse 5.6.1:**

Says my daughter of this sea-bound world,  
‘Tis she that this world did create,  
And all the world she would permeate;  
It was she that took (from Bali) all the worlds.  
She it was that pulled the world out and held  
In her stomach (during deluge) all the worlds;  
Unto You worldlings, what can 1 say about this?  
She is by the Lord Supreme possessed, perhaps.

**Notes:**

\(i\) It is God that created the entire Universe. The relevant expressions in ‘Chāndogya Upaniṣad’ are ‘Sadeva’ ‘Ekameva’ and ‘advitīyam’, indicative of the fact that the Lord combines in Himself all the three causes of creation, namely, the ‘Upādhāna’ (material cause) ‘Sahakāri’ (Operative cause) and ‘Nimitta’ (Instrumental cause). The fact that the Lord is the sole cause of creation is underlined by the Nāyakī’s statement that it is She (God, manifest in her) that created the sea-bound worlds.

Apart from the Lord combining in Himself the triple causes of creation, yet another unique feature is that He is not apart from the things created. He resides in all things and beings, having name and form. The different names denoting them all, refer to Him as well, He being the Inner Soul of all. This is indeed unique, as, in the work-a-day world, the names of the creator and the things created are distinct. In the terse language of Vedanta, this special feature is known as ‘aparyavasāna vṛtti’ and this is what the Nāyakī emphasises. Having created the world, she also becomes the world, the thing created) by permeating the whole of it.

\(ii\) The mother wonders how her daughter, a staunch exponent of ‘Viśiṣṭādvaita the triune monism, says things smacking of absolute monism (advaita) and apprehends that the Nāyakī, perhaps, stands possessed by the Lord Himself and, therefore, speaks in this strain, The kinsmen who expected the mother to be more specific in her diagnosis of the Nāyakī’s malady, are cut to size, when she says that her daughter is in such a highly evolved state of God-love, on a par with the exalted ever-free angels of Heaven, that her actions and utterances are much beyond the grasp of the worldlings who were utter strangers to such ennobling experience of God-love and God-enjoyment.

**English translation of verse 5.6.2:**

On learning’s threshold is my daughter and yet she says,  
All branches of learning she had mastered, she is  
Learning itself, all learning by her was set up,  
She puts an end to it all and just stores it up  
Inside her, she is the quintessence of all learning;  
Evidently, she is by the Lord possessed, whom all learning  
Reflects, what can I tell you, at the bottom of learning?

### Notes

\(i\) The Lord is the embodiment of all learning, the aggregate of the Vedas; He disseminates particular branches of learning at the appropriate moments; He is the final arbiter of the true meanings of the texts and at the time of dissolution of the worlds, He stores up all learning in His mind. Indeed, the object of all learning is to know Him.

\(ii\) *Mastered all learning*: Transposed as Kṛṣṇa, that the Nāyakī is, this could refer to the mastery attained by Śrī Kṛṣṇa within a marvellously short period of sixty-four days, as the pupil of Sāndīpini.

**English translation of verse 5.6.3:**

Says my daughter with insight clear,  
The visible elements, the Earth, Wind and Water.  
Sky and Fire she is; seems she possessed indeed  
By the sea-hued Lord, what can I tell you, of this world?

### Note

The mother tells the kinsmen that, unlike them all, with a narrow vision, confined to the things seen around, her daughter (Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī) has a cosmic vision. New visions of beauty shine before the eyes of a Saint. He alone can see and enjoy the viśvarūpa (Universal form) of the Lord. He hears the unheard melodies and enjoys divine scents, unfelt on the Earth, and soars into an ampler ether, diviner air. The Nāyakī, deputising as God, says that she is everything, the elements and all, with the clear knowledge that the elements are subject to His control and are ordained by Him.

**English translation of verse 5.6.4:**

Says this tender girl with lips like red fruit,  
‘Tis she that dominates all acts, past, present and future.  
And she ‘tis that creates the authors of those acts.  
And again, ‘tis she that enjoys their fruits,  
It seems, the Lord of red lotus eyes has into her got;  
Of her, what indeed can I tell you, an innocent lot?

### Note

The Lord is referred to as the enjoyer of the fruits of all actions which He controls, both the performance and the performers, c.f. śloka IX-24, Bhagavad Gītā, where the Lord has said that it is He that is propitiated by the various acts, rites and rituals. The Nāyakī, possessed by God, speaks as though she is God. Not having the faintest idea of this strange malady, the poor, innocent kinsfolk foolishly insist upon having more and more details.

**English translation of verse 5.6.5:**

Declares my darling, ‘tis she that justly governs the worlds.  
She ‘tis that lifted effortlessly mount (Govardan),  
Slew the Asuras many unerringly and churned safely the milk-ocean,  
Controlled once the military strategy and victory for the five (Pāṇḍavas) secured;  
She seems, possessed by the sea-hued Lord of unremitting attention  
Unto His devotees; to you. bent upon having all the information,  
Oh, worldlings, What can 1 say of her that is beyond reclamation?

### Note

All these deeds performed by the Supreme Lord, from time to time, the Nāyakī, possessed by Him, attributes to herself. How can the worldlings standing ashore comprehend the mysticism of the Nāyakī (Āḻvār), sunk deep in the ocean of Divine consciousness?

**English translation of verse 5.6.6:**

### Translation

My spear-eyed daughter avers, ‘tis she that lifted  
Mount (Govardana) with bamboos profuse, slew the bulls seven,  
She is the Cowherd-Chief that tended the calves many  
And a multitude of cows: seems possessed by the Lord,  
Chief of Celestials; unto you, the spear-eyed dames,  
What can I say about my daughter, thus transformed?

### Note

The Supreme Lord, Chief of the ‘Nitya Sūrīs’ in Heaven, having taken possession of the Nāyakī, she identifies herself with His incarnation as Śrī Kṛṣṇa, as set out above. As a little lad, Kṛṣṇa tended the calves, literally played with them, as one of them and when He came of age, He grazed the cows, a vast multitude, like unto the change-over from, ‘Brahmacarya’ (bachelorhood) to the next stage of ‘Grahasta’ (householder).

**English translation of verse 5.6.7:**

What indeed can 1 tell you, my kinsmen?  
Says my little one, with vision clear, relatives she has none  
And yet, all are related to her, she makes relations  
And ‘tis she that destroys them too, she is all-in-one  
Unto those that seek her, heart and soul; seems taken in  
By the wondrous Lord whom by mere self-effort none can attain?

### Notes

\(i\) The Lord can be said to have no relations, in the sense that the individual souls either stray away from Him and run after minor deities or those that seek Him are not quite conscious of their true inter-relationship. In any case, none has ever attained Him through self-effort alone, without His co-operative grace.

\(ii\) All are related to the Lord, as they are all His subjects for whom He has great concern and He helps them all, unseen, even though they may not be conscious of this. Even if the subjects propitiate minor deities, He is the ultimate object of adoration, being the Internal Controller of those deities as well.

\(iii\) The Lord makes relatives in the sense that He attracts the subjects unto Him by exhibiting His charms. He also puts aside those, who are. by dint of their Karma, oblivious of their relationship with Him and are inclined towards minor deities. This is just as bad as destroying their relationship with Him. In a sense, the Lord can also be taken to destroy His devotees, exclusively related to Him, by making them solely absorbed in His beauty, traits and deeds and destroying their sense of individuality. Thus, they get literally lost in Him.

\(iv\) The Lord is ‘All-in-one’ and constitutes every conceivable relationship unto those that look upon Him, as the Sole Sustainer, (c.f. Śloka 5 of Stotra Ratna of Saint Yāmuna, where he adores Saint Nammāḻvār, in this manner.)




## 5.6.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

**English translation of verse 5.6.8:**

How nice is my tendril-like darling’s speech!  
What can I tell You worldlings that insist I should about her tell?  
Claims she to be Mukkaṭpirāṉ (Śiva) who, some proclaim,  
Is the Lord Supreme, as well as Ticaimukaṉ of great fame,  
The exalted devas and their eminent chief besides the Sages  
Of great renown; Could it be that she stands  
Possessed by the redoubted Lord, cloud-hued?

### Note

What the Nāyakī brings out here is that the Supreme Lord is the Internal Controller of all, including Śiva, Ticaimukaṉ (Brahmā), Indra and other celebrities. They just constitute His bodies, in the same way as all other beings and things.

**English translation of verse 5.6.9:**

Unto you, importunate worldlings, what can I say  
About the antics lovely of this sinner’s daughter, like unto a creeper?  
Aloof she stands from (the subjects’) evil acts, she says  
While in evil acts persist (those that do her displeasure incur),  
Again, she it is that cures the (devotees’) fell sins and passes  
Them on to (their opponents) others, ‘tis she that reduced to ashes  
The felon’s Laṅkā; is she by Him possessed who bears  
The bird tough (unto His opponents) on His banner?

### Note

The sentient and non-sentient beings are the Lord’s bodies. He is thus the ‘Viśeṣya’ or Substance present in all these bodies, known as the ‘Viśeṣaṇa’, the attributes or modes of the Lord. While the attributes undergo transformations, such as growth and decay, enjoyment and misery, the ‘Viśeṣya’ undergoes no changes and is ‘nirvikāra’. While the ‘Jīva’ or the individual Soul experiences alternately, weal and woe, the Lord inside the ‘Jīva’ remains unattached to the fruits of the actions of the Jīva. While the body, the outer cloak of the ‘Jīva’, is imposed on the latter by dint of its past ‘Karma’ (acts), the Lord enters the Jīva, as a matter of grace, not bound by the compulsions of a pre-determined factor. Creation actually means that He makes the non-sentient things undergo the changes of state and endows the individual souls with bodies and senseorgans, thus providing the necessary scope for expansioṇ of their knowledge. The disparities in the created beings, some being happy and others sorrowful, will not, however, render the Lord guilty of partiality and cruelty. The inequalities are the direct results of the actions of the individuals, and their sufferings are intended to chasten them and cure their ills through a cleansing process.

**English translation of verse 5.6.10:**

Says my daughter, she is the cuvarkkam lovely, the dismal hell  
And heavenly bliss (mōkkam); the souls with bodies many, at her disposal  
She has; the Primordial Force, she also is, with its wonderful potential;  
Perhaps, she is by the lovely cloud-hued Lord possessed;  
What can I tell unto you people squatting here so well,  
About my daughter whose locks are with lovely garland bedecked?

### Notes

\(i\) The Lord dominates every thing, the Svarga, the Hell and the Heaven. The gnostic, whose goal is God, attaches little importance to the Svarga, as, in his eyes, it is no better than hell, the one being a golden fetter and the other, an iron fetter. And yet, the worldlings are enamoured of the pleasures of Svarga and perform austere penances for gaining access to it. It is only from their angle of vision, the Svarga has been qualified by the epithet, lovely, here.

\(ii\) The ‘Mūla-Prakṛti, or the Primordial Force works wonders but even that can function only at the Lord’s will. Hence, the Nāyakī, possessed by the Lord, says that she is the Mūla-Prakṛti also.




## 5.6.11
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கூந்தல் மலர் மங்கைக்கும் மண் மடந்தைக்கும் குல ஆயர் கொழுந்துக்கும் கேள்வன் தன்னை  
வாய்ந்த வழுதி வள நாடன் மன்னு- குருகூர்ச் சடகோபன் குற்றேவல் செய்து  
ஆய்ந்த தமிழ் மாலை ஆயிரத்துள்- இவையும் ஓர் பத்தும் வல்லார் உலகில்-  
ஏந்து பெரும் செல்வத்தராய்த் திருமால்- அடியார்களைப் பூசிக்க நோற்றார்களே. (2)

**English translation of verse 5.6.11:**

Those that are well-versed in these songs ten,  
Out of the thousand composed by Kurukūr Caṭakōpaṉ,  
In intimate service of the Consort of (Lakṣmī) the lotus-born  
With locks lovely, Dame Earth and (Nappiṉṉai) cream of shepherd clan,  
Will, in this world, be blest with the huge wealth of devotion  
Unto Tirumāl’s votaries, for their due propitiation.

### Notes

\(i\) Worship of the Lord’s devotees is even more meritorious than worship of the Lord and it is rendered possible only through the Lord’s special grace. The influx of the Lord’s grace in this regard, is assured to the chanters of this decad.

\(ii\) Lakṣmī, the unfailing intercessor between Man and God, unleashes her irresistible physical charms on the Lord, when, in His unbridled independence, He turns a deaf ear to her entreaty to admit unto His fold, the contrite supplicant at His door-step. By virtue of her privileged position, as His beloved spouse, she casts a bewitching spell on Him; enthralled by her ravishing beauty. He then carries out Her dictates in full. The lovely locks of the Divine Mother of extraordinary fragrance play a very important part indeed, in this context. Hence, the reference to the Divine Mother’s lovely locks, in this song.
