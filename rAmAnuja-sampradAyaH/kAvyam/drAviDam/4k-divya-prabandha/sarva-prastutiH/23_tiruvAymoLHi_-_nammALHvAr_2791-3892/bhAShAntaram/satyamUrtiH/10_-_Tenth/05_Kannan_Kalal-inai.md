## 00 Intro10.5
It was out of deep compassion of unique dimensions that Saint Nammāḻvār did, in the midst of his mystic experience, *par excellence*, turn his attention on the people around, from time to time, in order to turn them God-ward. No doubt, he found them distressingly unresponsive and at one stage (*vide* stanza 25 of “Periya Tiruvantāti”, the third of Nammāḻvār’s four hymnals), he observed that it would be next to impossible to wean away the worldlings, the incorrigibles and make them God-bent. And yet, so great was his tender solicitude that he went on exhorting them to realise the utter futility of worldly possessions and sensual pleasures and take refuge at the lovely feet of the Supreme Lord, Śrīman Nārāyaṇa, the surest and the easiest way of securing release from the bondage of ‘Saṃsāra We could see this great gesture of the Āḻvār, in every centum of this grand hymnal, from I-2 onwards. This is, however, the last decad in which he tenders advice to the world around and a little hence, we will see him marching to heaven through the exalted and exhilarating route, known as the ‘Arcirādhi mārga’, the route of great distinction, earmarked for the released souls, heaven-bound. It is characteristic of the magnanimous elders of great eminence to say a few golden words, on the eve of their exit from this world, by way of parting advice to the near and dear ones around. The Āḻvār, who is overwhelmingly conscious of the Lord’s eagerness to lift him up to His Heavenly abode and the almost immediate prospect of his ascent to Heaven, tenders such parting advice in this decad, the very last of the series of lectures, delivered by him, for the edification and elevation of the earth-bound, sense-buried men of the world, c.f. Vibhīṣaṇa’s advice to Rāvaṇa, even while leaving Laṅkā, bound for Lord Rāma’s Camp—“na naśyanthaṃ upekṣeyam pradīptam śaraṇam yadhā” (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, VI.16.22).

The advice conveyed, in this swan-song of the Āḻvār, is short and sweet, the quintessence of ‘Tirumantra’ and ‘Dvaya’, calling upon the worldly men to chant Lord Nārāyaṇa’s holy name and serve Him, in conjunction with Mahālakṣmī, the Divine Mother, by word (singing), deed (offering choice flowers) and thought (loving meditation), vide aphorism 228 of Ācārya Hṛdayam).




## 10.5.1
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கண்ணன் கழல்இணை நண்ணும் மனம்உடையீர்  
எண்ணும் திருநாமம் திண்ணம் நாரணமே. (2)

kaṇṇaṉ kaḻaliṇai naṇṇum maṉamuṭaiyīr  
eṇṇum tirunāmam tiṇṇam nāraṇamē. (2)

**English translation of verse 10.5.1:**

Nāraṇam [Nāraṇa] is the holy name You have to meditate upon;  
Besides this, let me affirm, there’s none to reckon,  
Take note, Ye, men, yearning for the lovely pair of feet  
Of Kaṇṇaṉ, our Lord, [Who is easily accessible to the devout].

**Notes:**

In 1-2-10, the Āḻvār taught his fellow-beings how to pray, by giving out the substance of the eight-syllabled ‘Tirumantra’. The Subject of this ‘Mantra’ is none other than the Supreme Lord, Nārāyaṇa (used, in short form, as Nāraṇam), the abode of countless souls, of vast excellence and an inexhaustible fountain of bliss. That Nārāyaṇa is the sole Refuge unto those who are desirous of attaining Him, is now re-iterated by the Āḻvār in his valedictory address to the world, at large. No other qualification is needed than the yearning to attain the Lord’s lovely pair of feet, for chanting this holy name of His, the great Mantra. As a matter of fact, even the highest degree of attainments, one can have with the utmost exertion, will by-no-means be commensurate with the end in view, namely, enjoyment of heavenly bliss in that Eternal Land whence there is no returning. So then, the only qualification, if at all, is the earnest desire, on the part of the votary, to achieve this highest goal and the one, thus qualified, becomes eligible to chant the holy name, Nārāyaṇa, which delivers the goods, all right. Even so, the Lord is referred to, as Kṛṣṇa in this song, so as to attract the subjects by virtue of His amazing simplicity, instead of scaring them away by emphasising His Supremacy and Sovereignty over the entire universe, His overlordship.




## 10.5.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நாரணன் எம்மான் பாரணங்காளன்  
வாரணம் தொலைத்த காரணன் தானே.

nāraṇaṉ emmāṉ pāraṇaṅkāḷaṉ  
vāraṇam tolaitta kāraṇaṉ tāṉē.

**English translation of verse 10.5.2:**

Nāraṇaṉ, Our Sire, is Mother Earth’s loving Spouse,  
The One Who did ordain this vast Universe,  
Who destroyed the gigantic elephant  
Set upon Him by Kaṃsa, the great tyrant.

**Notes:**

The Āḻvār is now elaborating the meaning of the word ‘Nārāyaṇa used in a shortened form as ‘Nāraṇan’, in the preceding song. Mother Earth (Bhū Devī) is one of the three principal Consorts of Lord Nārāyaṇa and reference to Bhū Devī, in this song can be taken to include the two other Consorts as well, ‘Śrī’ and ‘Nīḷā’ Devis, in the Celestial setting. “Our Sire” would denote the ‘Lord’s sovereignty over the ‘Līlā Vibhūti’, the Sportive Universe, in which we all live. That means, the Lord is depicted as the Sovereign Master of both the ‘Nitya’ (eternal) and ‘Līlā’ (sportive) Vibhūtīs (worlds).

‘Tirumantra’ comprises three words, namely, ‘*Aum*’ (Praṇava) ‘*Namaḥ*’ and ‘Nārāyaṇāya’. Of the three letters, comprised in the first word, the first letter ‘A’ denotes the Lord Himself, the originator of the whole universe and the protector of all. ‘A’ is the very first of all letters and could thus symbolise the origin of the Universe, namely, the Lord and this is clearly brought out in this song. Derived, as it is, from the root ‘Ava rakṣaṇe’, ‘A’ means Protector and here again, it could appropriately denote the Lord, Who is the Protector of all. But then, when the Lord extends protection, the immediate presence of Mahālakṣmī, the Lord’s Divine Consort, is absolutely necessary and, in this context, her association with the letter ‘A’ as a protecting force, is to be thought of. Although the Lord is surely capable of protecting His subjects, all by Himself, yet the Sāstras say that He bestows such benevolent protection in the company of His consort, Mahālakṣmī Who is grace personified. “Lakṣmyā saha Hṛṣīkeśo Devyā Kāruṇyarūpayā, rakṣakas saiva sidhānte Vedāntepi ca gīyate” etc. This is just to eliminate the possible risk of the Supreme Lord being alienated from His subjects, on account of the innumerable lapses of the latter. Therefore, the letter ‘A’ has to denote Lord Nārāyaṇa, in close conjunction with Mahālakṣmī. That is why this conjunction is referred to, in this song.

The twin aspects of protection, extended by the Lord to His Subjects, are removal of all undesirable things and fulfilment of aspirations, as applied to individuals. The slaying of the formidable elephant, Kuvalayāpiṭam, referred to in this song, indicates how the Lord removes the evils, the impediments.




## 10.5.3
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

தானே உலகுஎல்லாம் தானே படைத்துஇடந்து  
தானே உண்டுஉமிழ்ந்து தானே ஆள்வானே.

tāṉē ulakuellām tāṉē paṭaittuiṭantu  
tāṉē uṇṭuumiḻntu tāṉē āḷvāṉē.

**English translation of verse 10.5.3:**

‘Tis He (Nārāyaṇa), Who does the whole universe pervade,  
Who did create it all with no external aid,  
Who did in His stomach sustain all the worlds  
And then spat them out; ‘tis He who did once again  
Lift the Earth from deep waters, everything He does ordain.

**Notes:**

The meaning of the word, ‘Nārāyaṇa’, is expounded further, particularly, the role of the Lord, as the Protector of one and all. The entire universe constitutes His very body and as such, He is bound to sustain His body. He is the sole Architect of the Universe, combining in Himself the triple causes of creation, the *Material*, the *Operative* and the *Instrumental* causes. Creation of the Universe, dowering myriads of souls with the appropriate bodies, the vehicles of expression or the media of evolution, is by itself the Lord’s act of grace galore. On the top of that, He sustains all the worlds, with their massive contents of things and beings, inside His stomach during the deluge and thus saves them all from being swept off and dismembered by the whirling waters of terrific depth and width. And then, He spits them back into their erstwhile positions, quite *in tact*. The several facets of the Lord’s universal protection are thus indicated.




## 10.5.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஆள்வான் ஆழிநீர்க் கோள்வாய் அரவுஅணையான்  
தாள்வாய் மலர்இட்டு நாள்வாய் நாடீரே.

āḷvāṉ āḻinīrk kōḷvāy aravuaṇaiyāṉ  
tāḷvāy malariṭṭu nāḷvāy nāṭīrē.

**English translation of verse 10.5.4:**

Reclining on the serpent, strong and smart,  
The Lord holds sway over the Universe vast;  
Him may You adore, all the time,  
Placing at His lovely feet flowers fine.

**Notes:**

‘Āya’, the dative ending of the last word of Tirumantra, that is, ‘Nārāyaṇāya’ reveals the deep urge of the subject to render service unto the Lord in every conceivable manner, like that of ‘Ādiśesa’ (first servant), rather the factotum who serves the Lord in a number of ways, as umbrella, throne, footwear, bed etc., etc. Therefore it is, that the Āḻvār calls upon the worldlings to render service unto the Lord, in keeping with the above elucidation of the meaning of the word ‘Nārāyaṇāya’.

The Lord reclines on Ādiśesa, in the Milk ocean, the seat of His creative activity, well within the ear-shot of the appeal of ardent devotees, so as to fulfil His role, as the Universal Protector. He is also easily worshippable, with whatever flowers the votary can get hold of.




## 10.5.5
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நாடீர் நாள்தோறும் வாடா மலர்கொண்டு  
பாடீர் அவன்நாமம் வீடே பெறலாமே.

nāṭīr nāḷtōṟum vāṭā malarkoṇṭu  
pāṭīr avaṉnāmam vīṭē peṟalāmē.

**English translation of verse 10.5.5:**

Attain you shall emancipation  
If you worship the Lord daily  
With fresh flowers and sing gaily  
His holy names, set to nice tunes.

**Notes:**

When one renders service unto the Lord, in keeping with one’s essential nature, as the exclusive vassal of the Lord, solely dependent on Him, one is sure to attain Heaven, the final emancipation from the terrific cycle of birth and death and eternal service unto the Lord in Heaven, in close proximity. The worship of the Lord has to go on, all the time, even as one satiates one’s hunger by taking food with regular frequency. It is not mere spelling out the Lord’s names that the Āḻvār speaks of here but singing the names tunefully.




## 10.5.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மேயான் வேங்கடம் காயாமலர் வண்ணன்  
பேயார் முலைஉண்ட வாயான் மாதவனே. (2)

mēyāṉ vēṅkaṭam kāyāmalar vaṇṇaṉ  
pēyār mulaiuṇṭa vāyāṉ mātavaṉē. (2)

**English translation of verse 10.5.6:**

Mātavaṉ, of the lovely complexion of lily flower,  
Who did the devil’s (Pūthanā’s) breasts gather  
And suck them out to death, is the one  
Who in (Mount) Vēṅkaṭam stays on.

**Notes:**

In the preceding song, the Āḻvār had asked the men around, to seek out the Supreme Lord and worship Him daily with flowers and sing His glorious names. And now, he tells them that the Lord is not that cold, icy abstract thing, formless and invisible, as some would say, but is easily accessible, atop Mount Tiruvēṅkaṭam, exhibiting His resplendent Form of exquisite charm. As already elucidated by the Āḻvār in X-4-4, the Lord takes up position in pilgrim centres like Mount Tiruvēṅkaṭam, only to step on to the heart-region of His devotees. The Lord enthrals the votaries through His (worshippable) Iconic Form of extraordinary charm. As Nampiḷḷai puts it, *even a tiny twig will come under the magic spell of this charm and cannot resist the urge to serve Him*, an urge, deep and irresistible and a mere twig though, it just cannot exist without serving Him. What is even more attractive is the wholesome conjunction of the Lord with the Divine Mother, as Mādhava, bearing Māhalakṣmī on His winsome chest, a highly profitable combination from the point of view of emancipation of the errant supplicants, with countless transgressions.




## 10.5.7
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மாதவன் என்றுஎன்று ஓத வல்லீரேல்  
தீதுஒன்றும் அடையா ஏதம் சாராவே.

mātavaṉ eṉṟueṉṟu ōta vallīrēl  
tītuoṉṟum aṭaiyā ētam cārāvē.

**English translation of verse 10.5.7:**

Past sins shall not affect you at all  
Nor shall sins taint you, in future, as well,  
If that name, ‘Mātavaṉ’ you’d but spell

**Notes:**

\(i\) Remarkable indeed is the magnitude of the Āḻvār’s compassion for the fellow-beings. Here is the Āḻvār’s recipe for those who are unable to seek out the Lord, in His worshippable image Form, and worship Him daily with choice flowers either at Tiruvēṅkaṭam or any other pilgrim centre. It will suffice if they chant ‘Dvaya’, the gem of a mantra, a couplet, the first part of which enjoins that the individual soul should seek refuge at the lotus feet of the Lord through the mediation of Mahālakṣmī while the second stipulates that service unto them both, in a state of conjunction, should be prayed for. Again, spelling the name, ‘Mādhava’, denoting this holy combination, need not be of one’s own longing to pronounce it; it would be enough if some one chanted it and these people merely followed suit.

\(ii\) The holy name (Tirumantra) will, by itself, confer on its chanters salvation, and ‘Dvaya’, the gem of a mantra, would likewise procure salvation for those who utter it. Well, in that name, ‘Mādhava’, there is a combination of both ‘Tirumantra’ and ‘Dvaya’, with redoubled efficiency, keeping the votaries above all sins, past, present and future.




## 10.5.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

சாரா ஏதங்கள் நீரார் முகில்வண்ணன்  
பேர் ஆர் ஓதுவார் ஆரார் அமரரே.

cārā ētaṅkaḷ nīrār mukilvaṇṇaṉ  
pēr ār ōtuvār ārār amararē.

**English translation of verse 10.5.8:**

Those that chant the holy names of the cloud-hued Lord,  
Whatever might be their descent and deeds,  
Shall well be beyond the reach of evil  
And be on a par with the redoubted Celestials.

**Notes:**

That there is no restriction whatsoever, conditioning one’s eligibility to chant the Lord’s names, is clearly brought out, in this song. Whosoever chants the holy names of the Lord, of enchanting complexion, shall not only be beyond the reach of evil of any kind but shall also be on a par with the exalted Celestials. The mere sight of the cloud-hued Lord is so exhilarating that it cannot but tempt the beholders to utter His holy names, over and over again. Irrespective of their parentage and occupation, those that recite the Lord’s glorious names acquire a stature equal to that of the Celestials who subsist solely on divine service.




## 10.5.9
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அமரர்க்கு அரியானை தமர்கட்கு எளியானை  
அமரத் தொழுவார்கட்கு அமரா வினைகளே.

amararkku ariyāṉai tamarkaṭku eḷiyāṉai  
amarat toḻuvārkaṭku amarā viṉaikaḷē.

**English translation of verse 10.5.9:**

They that are in God-love soaked and adore  
The Lord Supreme, beyond the reach of even Brahmā and others,  
But unto the devout easily accessible,  
Are indeed out of reach of ills and evils.

**Notes:**

The Lord is, no doubt, the Great Giver, rather the one and only Giver and there is no gift beyond Him. He is known as ‘Arthidhārtha paridhāna dhīkṣitha’. The ‘Ithihāsas’ and Purāṇas contain frequent references to the Lord’s benevolence unto the Devas vis-a-vis the Asuras, on whom the Lord inflicts sufferings. The Āḻvār has also alluded to this fact, quite often, in this hymnal itself. And yet, the Lord makes Himself scarce, that is, He does not reveal His glory and grandeur to the Devas, their exaltation notwithstanding, because they are only self-seekers, always wanting the Lord to cater to their selfish ends. Even Brahmā, who emerged from the lotus flower which sprouted from the Lord’s navel, couldn’t cash in that unique position of advantage and perceive the Lord’s prowess, His greatness and grandeur, to any appreciable extent. On the other hand, the Lord is easily accessible to the devout, whose love unto Him is one of purity and virginity, with no strings attached. Love rendered to God for God’s sake, culminating in benediction or glorification of God, carries with it the highest reward, namely, the possession of God Himself. This fact is brought home, in this song.




## 10.5.10
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வினைவல் இருள்என்னும் முனைகள் வெருவிப்போம்  
சுனை நல் மலர்இட்டு நினைமின் நெடியானே.

viṉaival iruḷeṉṉum muṉaikaḷ veruvippōm  
cuṉai nal malariṭṭu niṉaimiṉ neṭiyāṉē.

**English translation of verse 10.5.10:**

Sins in their multitude and nescience dense,  
Shall, in sheer fright, clear out,  
When you on the Lord Supreme meditate  
And worship Him with nice flowers, fresh from ponds.

**Notes:**

\(i\) While the first song of this decad is in elucidation of ‘Tirumantra’ and the seventh deals with ‘Dvaya’, the ‘Mantra Ratna’ the later songs of this decad have a bearing on ‘*CARAMA ŚLOKA*’ (Bhagavad Gita XVIII-66), wherein Lord Kṛṣṇa assured Arjuna of release from all sins (Sarva pāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi).

\(ii\) The Āḻvār calls upon people to worship the Lord with flowers, easily procured from ponds, and even if this slight effort is not possible, they will do well to just meditate on the Lord Who keeps thinking of His subjects all the time and leads them on to exalted positions (Ahaṃ smarāmi Madbhaktaṃ nayāmi paramāṃ gathiṃ).




## 10.5.11
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நெடியான் அருள் சூடும் படியான் சடகோபன்  
நொடி ஆயிரத்துஇப்பத்து அடியார்க்கு அருள்பேறே (2)

neṭiyāṉ aruḷ cūṭum paṭiyāṉ caṭakōpaṉ  
noṭi āyirattuippattu aṭiyārkku aruḷpēṟē (2)

**English translation of verse 10.5.11:**

These songs ten, out of the thousand of Caṭakōpaṉ,  
Who basks in the grand sun-shine  
Of the grace galore of the Lord Supreme,  
Will put the chanters on a par with him.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The Āḻvār ends up this decad by stating that the chanters of these ten songs will be blest, like him, with the Lord’s spontaneous grace, in super-abundance.

\(ii\) Rāmāyaṇa, the great Ithihāsa, took birth in the grace of the four-headed Brahmā who is anything but steady, while ‘Viṣṇu Purāṇa’, the ‘Purāṇa-Rātna is the outcome of the benedictive grace of ‘Puḷasthya [Pulastya] one of the four disciples of Śiva of tāmasik temperament and habits. On the other hand, Tiruvāymoḻi flowed from the loving grace of Lord Mahā Viṣṇu, the Puruṣottama of unalloyed purity. Herein lies the overwhelming superiority of Tiruvāymoḻi over Rāmāyaṇa, the epic of top-ranking excellence and Viṣṇupurāṇa which occupies the pride of place among the Purāṇas.

\(iii\) The Āḻvār could himself declare that he was the recipient of the Lord’s grace galore, because he was quite conscious of its great impact on him.
