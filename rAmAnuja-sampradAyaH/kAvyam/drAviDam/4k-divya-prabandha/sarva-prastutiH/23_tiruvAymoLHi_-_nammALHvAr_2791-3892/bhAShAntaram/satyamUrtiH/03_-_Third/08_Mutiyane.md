## 00 Intro3.8
While trying to sustain himself by recounting the glory of the Bhāgavatas (Lord’s devotees), as in the last decad, the Lord’s glorious traits and wondrous deeds were also dwelt upon, side by side, in each stanza of that decad, in view of the irresistible appeal of the latter. It may also be recalled that, in III-6-10 we could notice the Āḻvār’s deep anxiety to behold the Lord’s pair of legs dangling down the chariot on the battlefield at Kurukṣetra. And now, the other sense-organs of the Āḻvār compete with the eyes in the enjoyment of God. Each one of the Āḻvār’s senses, limbs and faculties, would appear to have acquired intelligence, the stature of sentient beings, on a par with the Āḻvār’s soul, with the result that there is the competitive exuberance on the part of the Āḻvār and his anatomical parts, come to life and capacitated for independent action, to get at the Lord individually and in the quickest possible manner and time. And, what is even more exciting is, each faculty aspires to transcend its functional limitations, resulting in an overlapping of functions as well. The hands would want to praise the Lord, the ears would long to drink deep of His nectarcan charm, the eyes would like to offer Him fruits and flowers, so on and so forth. Each sense yearning for the delight experienced by the other senses, is a very extraordinary state of affairs indeed! Does not the snake which does not have ears, as such, see and hear through the eyes only, the eyes performing the dual function of seeing and hearing, though not simultaneously? Again, the up-grading of the senses and limbs to the stature of sentient beings can only be compared to the Āḻvār being described, now and then, as melting down or getting dried up or cut into pieces, although the soul is beyond the mischief of the elements, cannot be burnt out by fire or drenched by water, or dried up by air or cleaved by weapons—vide Bhagavad Gītā 11-23 and 24.

The Āḻvār’s plight, in this decad, is like that of the members of a family in a famine-stricken area, who try to snatch the little food that is available from each other’s mouth, each one of them, driven to extreme hunger, being mindful of his or her own appeasement. And here, the Āḻvār’s senses, limbs and other faculties are vying with him, like unto the members of the famished family in question, for the appeasement of their own God-hunger and Godthirst. The Saint’s yearning for the Lord’s beatific vision is of such great depth that every moment of separation from the Beloved seems an age. His cry of anguish in this decad, melting even stony hearts has to be appreciated against this background.




## 3.8.1
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

முடியானே! மூவுலகும் தொழுது ஏத்தும் சீர்  
அடியானே, ஆழ் கடலைக் கடைந்தாய்! புள் ஊர்  
கொடியானே, கொண்டல் வண்ணா! அண்டத்து உம்பரில்  
நெடியானே!, என்று கிடக்கும் என் நெஞ்சமே. (2)

muṭiyāṉē! mūvulakum toḻutu ēttum cīr  
aṭiyāṉē, āḻ kaṭalaik kaṭaintāy! puḷ ūr  
koṭiyāṉē, koṇṭal vaṇṇā! aṇṭattu umparil  
neṭiyāṉē!, eṉṟu kiṭakkum eṉ neñcamē. (2)

**English translation of verse 3.8.1:**

My mind thaws down, calling you, my Lord!  
As wearer of the crown regal, possessor  
Of the feet by all the three worlds adored,  
Churner of the deep sea, having on Your banner  
The bird (Garuḍa), that also conveys You, cloud-hued.  
Super-eminent among heaven’s denizens and so on.

**Note**

The Āḻvār longs for the physical presence of the Lord whose resplendent crown proclaims His overlordship of the entire universe. Knowing full well that He can’t be seen unless He deigns to come and present Himself, the Āḻvār’s mind is, all the same, very much agitated, meditating on the various features and aspects of the Lord. The dovetailing of thoughts, as presented in this song, is indeed very interesting. Right from the crown on the Lord’s head proclaiming His sovereignty, the Āḻvār comes down to His lovely pair of feet, fit to be adored by one and all, high and low, good and bad, without distinction. Unto those who adore His feet the Lord gives His whole body, in between, with which He performs many wonderful, breath-taking deeds for their sake. And for those, who are unable to come and worship His feet, He moves about on His unique vehicle, namely winged-bird, Garuḍa, the very embodiment of the Vedas and grants them ‘darśan’. The blue-hued Lord, on His golden mount, the Garuḍa, affords a pleasant and attractive contrast in colours and the whole contour is exhilarating. Garuḍa, holding in his palms the feet of the Lord, proclaims the supremacy of the Lord, setting at naught the doubts of the Vedic scholars, confounded by the conflicting texts, some propounding the supremacy of Brahmā, the four-headed, some pointing to the supremacy of Śiva, a third set proclaiming the overlordship of Śrīmān Nārāyaṇa and so on. These conflicting claims could, no doubt, be resolved by a careful study and Śrīmān Nārāyaṇa’s supremacy established, beyond doubt. But here is Garuḍa, with the Lord mounted on his shoulders and holding in his palms His feet, the sole Refuge of one and all, simplifying ouṛ job and driving home the Lord’s supremacy.




## 3.8.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நெஞ்சமே! நீள் நகர் ஆக இருந்த என்  
தஞ்சனே, தண் இலங்கைக்கு இறையைச் செற்ற  
நஞ்சனே, ஞாலம் கொள்வான் குறள் ஆகிய  
வஞ்சனே, என்னும் எப்போதும், என் வாசகமே

neñcamē! nīḷ nakar āka irunta eṉ  
tañcaṉē, taṇ ilaṅkaikku iṟaiyaic ceṟṟa  
nañcaṉē, ñālam koḷvāṉ kuṟaḷ ākiya  
vañcaṉē, eṉṉum eppōtum, eṉ vācakamē

**English translation of verse 3.8.2:**

My tongue always keeps uttering Your names, my Lord!  
As my sole Refuge, in my mind firmly lodged,  
As if it were a citadel big, the poison deadly  
That destroyed Rāvaṇa, Chief of cool Laṅkā, the midget  
(Vāmana) Who, on the sly, got hold of the worlds (from Bali).

**Notes**

\(i\) The Āḻvār’s tongue prays unto the Lord.

> “Sire, even as you have condescended to get into the Āḻvār’s mind,
> pray, get into me, as well, so that I keep on uttering your names. I
> do hope the Āḻvār’s mind has no monopolistic hold on you”.

\(ii\) *My sole Refuge*: The Āḻvār’s tongue is well aware of the fact that it is the Āḻvār’s mind that has sought refuge in the Lord who, in turn, has come into it and stays there as if it is a huge citadel. And now, the tongue gives expression to this fact, regretting very much that the Earthlings do not address the Lord likewise. The pangs suffered by the Āḻvār are in respect of his separation from the Lord driving him in frantic search of the Lord, seeking the help of even inanimate things like mountains and oceans in the process. On the other hand, the pangs undergone by even Riṣīs of the eminence of Vaśiṣṭa and Vyāsa were due to their separation from their sons, as brought out vividly by the Purāṇas.

\(iii\) Mahābali was not destroyed like Rāvaṇa and the Supreme Lord even went to the former seeking alms, because he had the merit of being a great donor. The Āḻvār’s tongue which began by describing the Lord’s prowess as Śrī Rāma, is now completely absorbed in the Lord’s diplomacy as Vāmana.




## 3.8.3
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வாசகமே ஏத்த அருள் செய்யும் வானவர் தம்-  
நாயகனே, நாள் இளம் திங்களைக் கோள் விடுத்து,  
வேய் அகம் பால் வெண்ணெய் தொடு உண்ட ஆன் ஆயர்-  
தாயவனே, என்று தடவும் என் கைகளே.

vācakamē ētta aruḷ ceyyum vāṉavar tam-  
nāyakaṉē, nāḷ iḷam tiṅkaḷaik kōḷ viṭuttu,  
vēy akam pāl veṇṇey toṭu uṇṭa āṉ āyar-  
tāyavaṉē, eṉṟu taṭavum eṉ kaikaḷē.

**English translation of verse 3.8.3:**

My hands grope for you, the Celestials’ overlord,  
The one by my tongue solely lauded,  
Who, as the cow-herd (Kṛṣṇa) ale butter sweet,  
Stolen from the houses, bamboo-built,  
In the beam of light by your teeth lit,  
Sparkling like the rising Moon bright.

**Notes**

\(i\) The hands longing to experience the bliss, hitherto enjoyed solely by the tongue, addressed the Lord:

> “Oh, Lord of the Celestials! the Āḻvār’s tongue praises you as well as
> the Celestials do. Why has this special favour been extended by you to
> the tongue alone and what is it that precludes you from making us also
> taste that bliss?”

\(ii\) Kṛṣṇa, the dark lad, broke into the dark interior of the houses built of bamboo in the pastoral village of Gokula, to steal the butter stored up in huge pots. Groping His way through in rhe dark, when He felt, by the touch of His hands, the presence of the pots, He would feel gratified and smile. His pearl-white teeth, sparkling with the extra-brilliance of the full Moon just released from an eclipse, would then illumine the place, helping Him to get at the butter and eat it up.




## 3.8.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கைகளால் ஆரத் தொழுது தொழுது உன்னை,  
வைகலும் மாத்திரைப் போதும் ஓர் வீடு இன்றி,  
பை கொள் பாம்பு ஏறி உறை பரனே, உன்னை  
மெய்கொள்ளக் காண( விரும்பும் என் கண்களே.

kaikaḷāl ārat toḻutu toḻutu uṉṉai,  
vaikalum māttiraip pōtum ōr vīṭu iṉṟi,  
pai koḷ pāmpu ēṟi uṟai paraṉē, uṉṉai  
meykoḷḷak kāṇa( virumpum eṉ kaṇkaḷē.

**English translation of verse 3.8.4:**

Oh, Supreme Lord, resting on hooded Serpent,  
My eyes long for the pleasure of my hands  
Which have their fill of salutation unto you and besides  
Wish to behold truly your form exquisite, with no respite.

**Notes**

\(i\) The Āḻvār’s eyes pine for the experience of the hands besides their own. They long to enjoy the bliss of worshipping the Lord, thus performing the function of the hands. They also wish to truly (physically) behold His sweet Form, as distinguished from mere mental perception so that He can be touched and embraced.

\(ii\) That portion of this stanza (original) which deals with the intense worship of the Lord by the hands (repeatedly), is construed by a section of Śrī Vaiṣṇavas as stressing the necessity for worshipping the Lord several times over, as against the creed of many others, to prostrate, at a time, only once. The latter avoid the overtone or semblance of self-effort for the propitiation of the Lord, which militates against the basic principle of ‘Prapatti’ or loving surrender to the Lord’s sweet grace. References to this very topic of worship elsewhere in ‘Tiruvāymoḻi’ (2-10-9 and 1X-3-9), go to reinforce the latter code of discipline.




## 3.8.5
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கண்களால் காண வருங்கொல்? என்று ஆசையால்,  
மண் கொண்ட வாமனன் ஏற மகிழ்ந்து செல்,  
பண் கொண்ட புள்ளின் சிறகு ஒலி பாவித்து,  
திண் கொள்ள ஓர்க்கும் கிடந்து என் செவிகளே.

kaṇkaḷāl kāṇa varuṅkol? eṉṟu ācaiyāl,  
maṇ koṇṭa vāmaṉaṉ ēṟa makiḻntu cel,  
paṇ koṇṭa puḷḷiṉ ciṟaku oli pāvittu,  
tiṇ koḷḷa ōrkkum kiṭantu eṉ cevikaḷē.

**English translation of verse 3.8.5:**

My ears long to see Vāmaṉaṉ (the Lord),  
Who (from Bali) got hold of the land,  
Moving on His merry mount, (Garuḍa)  
And intently hear the sweet sound.  
Of the tuneful wings of that bird.

**Notes**

\(i\) The Āḻvār’s ears long both to see and hear and, therefore, drew up a picture, as above. The Lord moving on His merry mount, Garuḍa, must be seen by the ears which should also listen to the sweet strains emanating from the wings of that angelic bird, in flight, like unto the tuneful Sāma Veda (Bṛhat and Rantra Sāma).

\(ii\) As Vāmana or Tṛvikrama [Tṛvikrama], the Lord did not press into service His standing vehicle, Garuḍa and yet, what is intended to convey here is that the Lord would fly, here and there, to reclaim His straying possessions.

\(iii\) *Intently hear*: Hearing the music of the wings of Garuḍa to the exclusion of everything else, not even the Lord or His mount. Even as the Āḻvār is now seen engrossed in the music of the wings of Garuḍa, Rukmiṇi was thrilled and enraptured by the sound from Śrī Kṛṣṇa’s conch (Pāñcajanya), at the crucial moment near about the Devī’s temple where she was anxiously awaiting Him, the great Rescuer. And then, when Sītā was tortured into believing that Rāma was dead. Rāvaṇa holding out before her the severed head of an illusory Rāma the heartening sound came to her from Śrī Rāma’s bow, right from the sea-shore, and enabled her to see through the dirty game of Rāvaṇa.




## 3.8.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

செவிகளால் ஆர நின் கீர்த்திக் கனி என்னும்  
கவிகளே காலப் பண் தேன் உறைப்பத் துற்று,  
புவியின்மேல் பொன் நெடும் சக்கரத்து உன்னையே.  
அவிவு இன்றி ஆதரிக்கும் எனது ஆவியே.

cevikaḷāl āra niṉ kīrttik kaṉi eṉṉum  
kavikaḷē kālap paṇ tēṉ uṟaippat tuṟṟu,  
puviyiṉmēl poṉ neṭum cakkarattu uṉṉaiyē.  
avivu iṉṟi ātarikkum eṉatu āviyē.

**English translation of verse 3.8.6:**

My spirit yearns to have its ears filled, oh Lord,  
With songs that do your glory laud.  
Sweet as fruits soaked in the honey of tunes appropriate  
And enjoy on Earth with no respite,  
Your form effulgent, wielding the discus large and exquisite.

**Notes**

\(i\) The Āḻvār’s spirit either wants to grow ears or be transformed into ears to feast sumptuously on the songs singing the great glory of the Lord, the delicious fruits rendered sweeter, soaked and saturated with honey. If the songs are like unto fruits the tunes in which they are sung, sweeten them like honey.

\(ii\) Hearing such melodies as Sāma Veda and beholding the Lord with His effulgent discus are experiences pertaining to Heaven and yet, the Āḻvār aspires for them, right here, on Earth.




## 3.8.7
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஆவியே! ஆர் அமுதே! என்னை ஆளுடைத்,  
தூவி அம் புள் உடையாய்! சுடர் நேமியாய்,  
பாவியேன் நெஞ்சம் புலம்பப் பலகாலும்,  
கூவியும் காணப்பெறேன் உன கோலமே.

āviyē! ār amutē! eṉṉai āḷuṭait,  
tūvi am puḷ uṭaiyāy! cuṭar nēmiyāy,  
pāviyēṉ neñcam pulampap palakālum,  
kūviyum kāṇappeṟēṉ uṉa kōlamē.

**English translation of verse 3.8.7:**

You are my very Soul, the nectar dear,  
(Garuḍa), the bird with lovely plumes, my redeemer,  
Is your glorious mount, You are the wielder  
Of the discus resplendent, Your form exquisite,  
This sinner couldn’t behold, as yet,  
Tho’ many a time, my anguished mind called you out.

**Notes**

\(i\) From this stanza onwards, the Āḻvār narrates his own woes and wants. Hitherto, those of his senses were described. This is like the king narrating the miseries of his subjects first and then talking about his own.

\(ii\) It is difficult to live apart from one’s life. The Lord is not only dear to the Āḻvār like his own life but is also extremely delicious, the rare Nectar.

\(iii\) Once the mind is bent towards God and steeped in enjoying Him, there is no question of the woes still sticking on. Perhaps such benefits accruing to other minds are denied to the Āḻvār’s mind because of his heavy sins, according to him. While it would suffice if He is called but once, in this case, by calling Him out repeatedly, the Āḻvār has contravened his essential nature (Svarūpa) and yet, the Lord has not materialised, a double loss indeed!




## 3.8.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கோலமே! தாமரைக் கண்ணது ஓர் அஞ்சன  
நீலமே, நின்று எனது ஆவியை ஈர்கின்ற  
சீலமே, சென்று செல்லாதன முன் நிலாம்  
காலமே, உன்னை எந் நாள் கண்டுகொள்வனே?

kōlamē! tāmaraik kaṇṇatu ōr añcaṉa  
nīlamē, niṉṟu eṉatu āviyai īrkiṉṟa  
cīlamē, ceṉṟu cellātaṉa muṉ nilām  
kālamē, uṉṉai en nāḷ kaṇṭukoḷvaṉē?

**English translation of verse 3.8.8:**

Being lotus-eyed, with the unique complexion  
Of a dark-blue mountain,  
You are sheer beauty, Oh, Lord, Your loving condescension  
Has my soul ensnared; Time you do ordain,  
Past, present and future, you when can I attain?

**Notes**

\(i\) To the complaint made by the Āḻvār in the preceding song regarding the non-appearance of the Lord despite repeated calls, the Lord would appear to have observed that the Āḻvār should wait till the appropriate time for the bestowal of His grace. But the Āḻvār is quick to point out that ‘Time’ is also at the Lord’s beck and call and He is the sole Controller of ‘Time’, made up of the past, the present and the future and that the plea of time-factor cannot, therefore, hold water.

\(ii\) The Lord is not merely beautiful but is beauty itself. And it is not beauty alone but beauty and goodness combined. It is the persevering goodness on the part of the Lord that has enabled the Āḻvār to cling to Him, overcoming his natural tendency to run away from Him, for fear of defiling Him.

\(iii\) *When can I attain you?* The Āḻvār prays to the Lord to specify the point of time at which he can behold and enjoy His physical presence, evert as Śrī Rāma told Bharata that, on the completion of fourteen years, they will get together again.




## 3.8.9
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கொள்வன் நான் மாவலி மூவடி தா என்ற  
கள்வனே, கஞ்சனை வஞ்சித்து வாணனை  
உள் வன்மை தீர, ஓர் ஆயிரம் தோள் துணித்த  
புள் வல்லாய், உன்னை எஞ்ஞான்று பொருந்துவனே?

koḷvaṉ nāṉ māvali mūvaṭi tā eṉṟa  
kaḷvaṉē, kañcaṉai vañcittu vāṇaṉai  
uḷ vaṉmai tīra, ōr āyiram tōḷ tuṇitta  
puḷ vallāy, uṉṉai eññāṉṟu poruntuvaṉē?

**English translation of verse 3.8.9:**

Oh Lord, flying the bird (Garuḍa)!  
You did, on the sly, from Māvali demand  
Three strides of land;  
Kañcaṉ’s plans treacherous you foiled,  
Vāṇaṉ’s mental attitude you dispelled  
And lopped his arms thousand;  
When do I get unto you bound?

**Notes**

\(i\) Indra, Chief of the Devas was dispossessed of his Kingdom by Māvali (Mahā Bali), the Asura Chief. The former prayed to Lord Viṣṇu for the restoration of the lost Kingdom. But then, Mahā Bali was a generous donor, although he belonged to the Asura clan. So, the Lord had to adopt the peculiar method of seeking alms from Bali for getting back the lost domain. Not being conversant with the art of begging, the Lord, came down as Vāmana, the little lad, addressed Bali, by name, instead of the adulatory form of address, usually resorted to, by seasoned beggars. Bali didn’t mind it so much, seeing that the supplicant was but a lad, but when the demand, made by the lad, was just three paces of land, the pompous donor didn’t take it seriously. Looking at the indifference of Bali to the seemingly paltry demand, Vāmanamūrti reiterated His demand and compelled Bali’s attention.

\(ii\) Kañcaṉ (Kaṃsa) kept himself in the background and hit upon many a treacherous plan to kill Śrī Kṛṣṇa. The felon of an uncle would not indulge in a frontal attack on Kṛṣṇa, the nephew, and was hoping that one or the other of the several agencies energised by him would be able to kill Kṛṣṇa, so that he (Kaṃsa) might bemoan, in public, the loss of his nephew.

Alas! all his plans were thwarted by the Divine Lad, who vanquished the formidable array of His opponents and finally slew Kaṃsa himself.

\(iii\) Vāṇaṉ (Bāṇāsura), an avowed enemy of Lord Viṣṇu, was, however, an ardent votary of minor deities. The Lord, appeared before him, mounted on Garuḍa, disabused him (Bāṇāsura) of his heretical notion of God-head and revealed His supremacy, chopping off his thousand arms, like felling trees in the forest. See also detailed notes under III-10-4.




## 3.8.10
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

பொருந்திய மா மருதின் இடை போய எம்  
பெருந்தகாய், உன் கழல் காணிய பேதுற்று,  
வருந்திநான் வாசகமாலை கொண்டு உன்னையே  
இருந்து இருந்து எத்தனை காலம் புலம்புவனே?

poruntiya mā marutiṉ iṭai pōya em  
peruntakāy, uṉ kaḻal kāṇiya pētuṟṟu,  
varuntināṉ vācakamālai koṇṭu uṉṉaiyē  
iruntu iruntu ettaṉai kālam pulampuvaṉē?

**English translation of verse 3.8.10:**

My bounteous Lord, the ‘maruta’ trees huge, You broke,  
Crawling in between; how long shall I cry out, without break,  
Unto you, words of anguish, flowing like a wreath,  
Eager in the extreme to behold your lovely feet!

**Note**

Sage Nārada saw Nalakūpar and Maṇigrīva [Maṇigṛva], sons of Kubera, the Deity of Wealth, bathing in the river naked, and cursed them to become mere trees. Tied to a mortar by Queen Yaśodhā [Yasodha], as a punishment for His many pranks, Kṛṣṇa crawled on and hit the trees in question. The trees fell down and broke, releasing the regenerated Gandharvas from within. Sage Parāśara, who chronicled this episode in his Viṣṇupurāṇa, admired Śrī Kṛṣṇa’s lotus eyes, in this context. The Āḻvār’s mind is, however, steeped, as usual, in the feet of the crawling Lad.




## 3.8.11
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

புலம்பு சீர்ப் பூமி அளந்த பெருமானை,  
நலம்கொள்சீர் நன் குருகூர்ச் சடகோபன், சொல்  
வலம் கொண்ட ஆயிரத்துள் இவையும் ஓர் பத்து,  
இலங்குவான் யாவரும் ஏறுவர் சொன்னாலே. (2)

pulampu cīrp pūmi aḷanta perumāṉai,  
nalamkoḷcīr naṉ kurukūrc caṭakōpaṉ, col  
valam koṇṭa āyirattuḷ ivaiyum ōr pattu,  
ilaṅkuvāṉ yāvarum ēṟuvar coṉṉālē. (2)

**English translation of verse 3.8.11:**

Those that recite these songs ten,  
Out of the thousand of great literary excellence,  
Composed by the richly endowed Kurukūr Caṭakōpaṉ,  
In adoration of the munificent Lord who spanned the Universe,  
Will, one and all, ascend the resplendent heaven.

**Note**

As the Āḻvār aspired for heavenly bliss in this decad those that recite these ten stanzas are also assured of their ascent to heaven.
