## 00 Intro5.4
In order to put through the proceedings contemplated by the Nāyakī in the preceding decad, she has to first of all draw a sketch of her lover (the accused) for public exhibition and arraignment. But it is pitch dark and she can’t draw the picture. It seems as if the Lord is afraid of being exposed by the Nāyakī and has deliberately induced darkness of such intensity, The whole world is fast asleep, and she has no company. In such a milieu, she has recourse to the contemplation ofthe Lord’s auspicious traits, soothing indeed unto her aching heart.




## 5.4.1
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஊர் எல்லாம் துஞ்சி உலகு எல்லாம் நள் இருள் ஆய்  
நீர் எல்லாம் தேறி ஓர் நீள் இரவு ஆய் நீண்டதால்  
பார் எல்லாம் உண்ட நம் பாம்பு அணையான் வாரானால்  
ஆர் எல்லே! வல்வினையேன் ஆவி காப்பார் இனியே? (2)

ūr ellām tuñci ulaku ellām naḷ iruḷ āy  
nīr ellām tēṟi ōr nīḷ iravu āy nīṇṭatāl  
pār ellām uṇṭa nam pāmpu aṇaiyāṉ vārāṉāl  
ār ellē! valviṉaiyēṉ āvi kāppār iṉiyē? (2)

**English translation of verse 5.4.1:**

The town is asleep and the world in darkness plunged,  
Very, very quiet, the land and water have become;  
Alas! ‘tis one long night, the Lord on serpent-bed.  
Who once ate up the worlds, unto me doesn’t come;  
Who will save the life of this terrible sinner indeed?

**Note**

The Nāyakī laments that the benevolent Lord, who sustained all the worlds with their contents, in His stomach and protected them during the deluge, does not come to her aid in her present state of distress. The slanderous folks whose gossips actually fostered her God-love are fast asleep and so is the rest of the world. The Nāyakī cannot move about either because it is one long night, even longer than the longish[^1] nights of the Devas and visibility is next to nil. Further, there is none awake except her lone self.

[^1]:  Whereas ‘Time’ stands still in the self-luminous region, known as the ‘High Heaven ', and it is all day and no night (darkness-tamas), the day of the ‘Devas’ in the lower reaches of the upper worlds is as long as one year of ours, six months (mid-January to mid-July-Uttarāyana) constituting a day for them and the remaining six months (mid-July to mid-January—Dakṣiṇāyana) their night.





## 5.4.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஆவி காப்பார் இனி யார்? ஆழ் கடல் மண் விண் மூடி  
மா விகாரம் ஆய் ஓர் வல் இரவு ஆய் நீண்டதால்  
காவி சேர் வண்ணன் என் கண்ணனும் வாரானால்  
பாவியேன் நெஞ்சமே! நீயும் பாங்கு அல்லையே?.

āvi kāppār iṉi yār? āḻ kaṭal maṇ viṇ mūṭi  
mā vikāram āy ōr val iravu āy nīṇṭatāl  
kāvi cēr vaṇṇaṉ eṉ kaṇṇaṉum vārāṉāl  
pāviyēṉ neñcamē! nīyum pāṅku allaiyē?.

**English translation of verse 5.4.2:**

Who will save my life hereafter?  
You, this sinner’s mind, aren’t friendly either;  
Alas! tis one long, grim night that hides  
The deep sea, the land and the sky; Kaṇṇaṉ, my Lord  
Of blue tint, *my sole Refuge* doesn’t unto me come.

### Note

In the middle of the famous ‘Rāsa Krīḍa’, when Kṛṣṇa danced with the Gopīs, the damsels of Vrindāvan, He disappeared for a while, and the Gopīs were thrown on tenter hooks. But then, Kṛṣṇa reappeared and made amends for His sudden withdrawal by assuming the form, *par excellence*, far more exquisite than in the earlier session. The Nāyakī too probably expected the Lord to present Himself before her likewise, but this expectation didn’t materialise. Hence, this lamentation.




## 5.4.3
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நீயும் பாங்கு அல்லைகாண் நெஞ்சமே நீள் இரவும்  
ஓயும் பொழுது இன்றி ஊழி ஆய் நீண்டதால்  
காயும் கடும் சிலை என் காகுத்தன் வாரானால்  
மாயும் வகை அறியேன் வல்வினையேன் பெண் பிறந்தே

nīyum pāṅku allaikāṇ neñcamē nīḷ iravum  
ōyum poḻutu iṉṟi ūḻi āy nīṇṭatāl  
kāyum kaṭum cilai eṉ kākuttaṉ vārāṉāl  
māyum vakai aṟiyēṉ valviṉaiyēṉ peṇ piṟantē

**English translation of verse 5.4.3:**

You too, my mind, do not with me co-operate;  
Like unto eternity does the longish night further elongate;  
Kākuttaṉ, whose stern bow does the enemies annihilate,  
Appears not before me; this fell sinner knows not  
How to end this life, born a woman, alas! what’s my lot?

### Note

The Nāyakī is in the same predicament as Sītā during her captivity in Laṅkā. Sītā lamented that there was none in that hostile land who could help her with poison or a sharp knife to end her miserable life. There at least, Sītā could hear the heartening sound from Śrī Rāma’s (Kākuttaṉ’s) bow in the nearby battlefield, which disillusioned her and set her mind at ease, when Rāvaṇa produced the illusory head of Rāma and wanted her to believe that Rāma had been killed and his head severed. And now, Rāma does not come and present Himself before the Nāyakī. Her own mind, the principal accessory, does not subserve her, the darksome night, interminably long, aggravates her misery and above all, a woman that she is, with no independence, she is not free to die at will, by putting an end to her life.




## 5.4.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

பெண் பிறந்தார் எய்தும் பெரும் துயர் காண்கிலேன் என்று  
ஒண் சுடரோன் வாராது ஒளித்தான் இம்மண்அளந்த-  
கண் பெரிய செவ்வாய் எம் கார் ஏறு வாரானால்  
எண் பெரிய சிந்தைநோய் தீர்ப்பார் ஆர் என்னையே?

peṇ piṟantār eytum perum tuyar kāṇkilēṉ eṉṟu  
oṇ cuṭarōṉ vārātu oḷittāṉ immaṇaḷanta-  
kaṇ periya cevvāy em kār ēṟu vārāṉāl  
eṇ periya cintainōy tīrppār ār eṉṉaiyē?

**English translation of verse 5.4.4:**

Methinks the Sun from me hides and declines to see  
A woman in such great distress; my cloud-hued Lord,  
Trim as the bull, with eyes wide and lips red,  
Who the worlds spanned, comes not unto me;  
Alas! who can indeed cure me of my cruel mental malady?

### Note

The sun’s diurnal course is put through, regularly, at the Lord’s command and he dare not disobey. And yet, he would not come out, for fear of seeing the Nāyakī in such great distress. At the same time, he is afraid of being hunted out by the Lord’s emissaries and, therefore, keeps hiding somewhere beyond their reach. This has resulted in prolongation of the night. Well, Sun or no Sun, why should the Lord who had enthralled the Nāyakī and kept her madly in love with him, keep Himself away from her? This makes the Nāyakī dread the frightful prospect of having to linger for ever with her mental malady for which there seems to be no cure.




## 5.4.5
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஆர் என்னை ஆராய்வார்? அன்னையரும் தோழியரும்  
'நீர் என்னே?' என்னாதே நீள் இரவும் துஞ்சுவரால்  
கார் அன்ன மேனி நம் கண்ணனும் வாரானால்  
பேர் என்னை மாயாதால் வல்வினையேன் பின் நின்றே.

ār eṉṉai ārāyvār? aṉṉaiyarum tōḻiyarum  
'nīr eṉṉē?' eṉṉātē nīḷ iravum tuñcuvarāl  
kār aṉṉa mēṉi nam kaṇṇaṉum vārāṉāl  
pēr eṉṉai māyātāl valviṉaiyēṉ piṉ niṉṟē.

**English translation of verse 5.4.5:**

The unrelenting elders and mates sleep thro’ the long night;  
Alas! our cloud-hued Kaṇṇaṉ too appears net before me,  
Thus there’s none to stand by and think of me  
And yet, my name shall stay on, all right.  
Although this fell sinner be dead and gone.

### Note

Oh, how enchanting is this God-sickness! The Āḻvār who keeps scanning the whole scene, laments that there is none to think of him. What is even more exciting is his own statement that his name will outlive him. How true! the entire vaiṣṇavite world rests on him. But there the Nāyakī means to say that, on the one hand, the mates and the elders sleep on with no thought of her, while, on the other, the cloud-hued Lord is withholding Himself. And, therefore, she finds herself left alone and even if she dies, as she would very much like to, her name would still stay behind, making it impossible to close the pages of history upon her. It is noteworthy that the Āḻvār bears the name of the Lord’s feet (Śaṭakopa) where all of us rest our heads.




## 5.4.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

பின்நின்று காதல் நோய் நெஞ்சம் பெரிது அடுமால்  
முன்நின்று இரா ஊழி கண் புதைய மூடிற்றால்  
மன் நின்ற சக்கரத்து எம் மாயவனும் வாரானால்  
இந் நின்ற நீள் ஆவி காப்பார் ஆர் இவ் இடத்தே?

piṉniṉṟu kātal nōy neñcam peritu aṭumāl  
muṉniṉṟu irā ūḻi kaṇ putaiya mūṭiṟṟāl  
maṉ niṉṟa cakkarattu em māyavaṉum vārāṉāl  
in niṉṟa nīḷ āvi kāppār ār iv iṭattē?

**English translation of verse 5.4.6:**

This love-sickness which from behind eggs me on,  
Does my mind consume; alas! this age-long night, right in front,  
Blinds my eyes, my wondrous Lord who the inseparable discus holds on,  
Comes not; who then can unto my lingering life protection grant?

### Notes

\(i\) It is a strange sickness that afflicts the Nāyakī. This Godsickness or God-love keeps on pushing her from behind and will, she says, pursue her even on the yonder side of death, unlike the earthly kind of sickness, which holds sway only as long as there is life.

\(ii\) While the night makes for physical blindness, God-love screens her mind’s eye. It is a pity, the darkness prevents the Nāyakī from beholding her Lord, if He were at all to present Himself before her at that hour.




## 5.4.7
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

காப்பார் ஆர் இவ் இடத்து? கங்கு இருளின் நுண் துளி ஆய்  
சேண் பாலது ஊழி ஆய் செல்கின்ற கங்குல்வாய்த்  
தூப் பால வெண்சங்கு சக்கரத்தன் தோன்றானால்  
தீப் பால வல்வினையேன் தெய்வங்காள்! என் செய்கேனோ?

kāppār ār iv iṭattu? kaṅku iruḷiṉ nuṇ tuḷi āy  
cēṇ pālatu ūḻi āy celkiṉṟa kaṅkulvāyt  
tūp pāla veṇcaṅku cakkarattaṉ tōṉṟāṉāl  
tīp pāla valviṉaiyēṉ teyvaṅkāḷ! eṉ ceykēṉō?

**English translation of verse 5.4.7:**

The Lord, donning the discus and the conch, white and immaculate,  
Appears not before me, this night, dark and dewy;  
Who indeed can protect me, in this state?  
Oh, godlings, what can this dreadful sinner do?

### Notes

\(i\) When the whole world is plunged in protracted darkness the Nāyakī finds the godlings awake and, in a spirit of companionship, the wakeful Nāyakī cries out her woe to the wakeful deities and perhaps enlists their sympathy.

\(ii\) The Nāyakī who had earlier been proclaiming from the house-top that the Lord is the Sole Protector and we, His Subjects, are His exclusive vassals solely dependent on Him, now looks at the ‘Jīva’ (Soul), in isolation, and feels tormented, saying “how am I to be protected?”




## 5.4.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

தெய்வங்காள்! என் செய்கேன்? ஓர் இரவு ஏழ் ஊழி ஆய்  
மெய் வந்து நின்று எனது ஆவி மெலிவிக்கும்,  
கைவந்த சக்கரத்து என் கண்ணனும் வாரானால்  
தைவந்த தண் தென்றல் வெம் சுடரில் தான் அடுமே

teyvaṅkāḷ! eṉ ceykēṉ? ōr iravu ēḻ ūḻi āy  
mey vantu niṉṟu eṉatu āvi melivikkum,  
kaivanta cakkarattu eṉ kaṇṇaṉum vārāṉāl  
taivanta taṇ teṉṟal vem cuṭaril tāṉ aṭumē

**English translation of verse 5.4.8:**

Oh, godlings, what can I do? ages, a single night does loom,  
To torment my life, it has, in flesh and blood, come;  
Even Kaṇṇaṉ, my Lord, who the Discus always wields  
Comes not; so then the cool and soothing southerly breeze  
Blisters me worse than the fire well ablaze.

### Note

The Nāyakī is already emaciated due to separation from her Lord; the dark night of extra-ordinary duration now exploits her weakness by inflicting on her countless miseries. In her present state, even the cool, southerly breeze is far from soothing; actually, it produces the diametrically opposite effect. The night seems to assume, with a vengeance, several forms, (even as Sage Saubhari did for the enjoyment of pleasures with his numerous wives), to torment the Nāyakī in ever so many ways. In the olden days, when a person was pilloried in public for criminal offence, he would break down but the authority would nevertheless go on with the punishment, after providing due nourishment for his revival such as butter-milk etc.




## 5.4.9
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வெம் சுடரில் தான் அடுமால் வீங்கு இருளின் நுண் துளி ஆய்  
அம் சுடர வெய்யோன் அணி நெடும் தேர் தோன்றாதால்  
செஞ் சுடர்த் தாமரைக்கண் செல்வனும் வாரானால்  
நெஞ்சு இடர் தீர்ப்பார் இனியார்? நின்று உருகுகின்றேனே!

vem cuṭaril tāṉ aṭumāl vīṅku iruḷiṉ nuṇ tuḷi āy  
am cuṭara veyyōṉ aṇi neṭum tēr tōṉṟātāl  
ceñ cuṭart tāmaraikkaṇ celvaṉum vārāṉāl  
neñcu iṭar tīrppār iṉiyār? niṉṟu urukukiṉṟēṉē!

**English translation of verse 5.4.9:**

The darksome night with minute dew beset  
Is unto me hotter than fire; alas! nowheie in sight  
Is Sun’s chariot, large and lovely or the opulent Lord bright.  
Of red-lotus eyes; my heart does all the time melt.  
Who will indeed my mind’s ache dispel in such a state?

### Note

The night is very oppressive and the Nāyakī is sinking deep in dejection. There is, however, no hope of relief yet; neither the Sun has come out nor even the Lord whom an ardent devotee of the calibre of the Nāyakī could reasonably expect in such moments of distress. Indeed, the Lord is the Sun that never sets and He illumines the entire universe Heaven downwards. The rising of the Sun would but be the dawn heralding the appearance of that Great Sun, the Lord. But then, the night is tormenting the Nāyakī, through its accomplice, the blistering dew, like unto Mārīca, pressed into service by the nefarious Rāvaṇa.




## 5.4.10
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நின்று உருகுகின்றேனே போல நெடு வானம்  
சென்று உருகி நுண் துளி ஆய் செல்கின்ற கங்குல்வாய்  
அன்று ஒருகால் வையம் அளந்த பிரான் வாரான் என்று  
ஒன்று ஒருகால் சொல்லாது உலகோ உறங்குமே

niṉṟu urukukiṉṟēṉē pōla neṭu vāṉam  
ceṉṟu uruki nuṇ tuḷi āy celkiṉṟa kaṅkulvāy  
aṉṟu orukāl vaiyam aḷanta pirāṉ vārāṉ eṉṟu  
oṉṟu orukāl collātu ulakō uṟaṅkumē

**English translation of verse 5.4.10:**

Alas! the world had into deep slumber gone.  
In this dark night, the minute dew drops down the sky broad,  
Like poor me, the sky too seems to melt down;  
There’s none to tell me but once that the Lord  
Who spanned the worlds once upon a time,  
Would not unto me care to come.

### Notes

\(i\) The Nāyakī thinks that the dew drops come from the sky, melting down, in distress, like her c.f. similar sentiments expressed by the Nāyakī in II-I ante.

\(ii\) It would be some consolation for her, if there was yet another soul, awake like her, to sustain her by recounting the Lord’s wondrous deeds as Trivikrama or tell her that she needn’t expect the Lord whose habit it was to keep away like this. In the latter case, the moment the Nāyakī was disabused of her fond hopes, her life would be extinct.




## 5.4.11
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

உறங்குவான் போல் யோகுசெய்த பெருமானை  
சிறந்த பொழில் சூழ் குருகூர்ச் சடகோபன் சொல்  
நிறம் கிளர்ந்த அந்தாதி ஆயிரத்துள் இப்பத்தால்  
இறந்து போய் வைகுந்தம் சேராவாறு எங்ஙனேயோ?

uṟaṅkuvāṉ pōl yōkuceyta perumāṉai  
ciṟanta poḻil cūḻ kurukūrc caṭakōpaṉ col  
niṟam kiḷarnta antāti āyirattuḷ ippattāl  
iṟantu pōy vaikuntam cērāvāṟu eṅṅaṉēyō?

**English translation of verse 5.4.11:**

How can those that recite these songs ten  
Out of the tuneful thousand, composed by Caṭakōpaṉ  
Of Kurukūr, surrounded by orchards lovely.  
Adoring the Lord who is asleep apparently  
But thinks out ways for His Subjects to thrive,  
Fail to enter Heaven at the end of their lives?

### Note

The Nāyakī had said, in the preceding song, that the whole world was asleep, suggesting that even the Lord had gone to sleep. The Lord was, however, quick to point out to the Āḻvār that He was not asleep but was only contemplating the manner in which He should present Himself to the Āḻvār and regale him. Thus informed, the Āḻvār could sustain himself and so also, the very township of Kurukūr, as could be inferred from the reference to its orchards, gay and lovely. Those that are conversant with this decad are bound to reach at the end of the present span of life, the high heaven, the land of perennial light, presided over by the Lord, the perpetual Sun.
