## 00 Intro1.10
In this decad, the Lord‘s voluntary or spontaneous grace is prominently brought out and extolled by the Āḻvār. Some Ācāryas, however, hold that the Āḻvār gives vent to his boundless joy resulting from the Lord‘s contact with him, limb by limb, mentioned in the preceding decad. The remarkable approach of Śrī Parāśara Bhaṭṭar, that intellectual giant of extraordinary divine fervour to this decad is as follows:

In the preceding decad, the Supreme Lord was shown to have finally got on to the Āḻvār’s head. Could there be any mystic experience more exalted than this? It was now up to the Lord to keep it up without once again snatching Himself away from the Āḻvār. That apart, the highest bliss, thus conferred by the Lord on the Āḻvār, led him on, to an introspection as to how he came by it. A thread-bare analysis of his own attainments reveals that he has none whatsoever and, at best, it could be said that he was God-bent and free from hatred for Him. Can it be said that a lemon fruit has secured a Kingdom, simply because a subject reverently placed a lemon fruit at the feet of a munificent King and got a liberal gift of territory, at the King’s pleasure? It is absolutely impossible, rather, it would be preposterous to correlate the slender means of the Individual, as good as non-existent, with the ‘End’, of mighty dimensions, as in the example cited above. Verily, the Lord is the root-cause even for the little merit, if any, acquired by the Individual, down the ages, as the latter was dowered with body and limbs, and put on a career of useful activity, only by Him. And so, the present ecstatic experience of the Āḻvār is traceable only to the Lord’s redemptive grace and, little wonder, the Āḻvār thaws down in grateful acknowledgement of the Lord’s benefaction, totally unrelated to the merit in him.

It will be seen from the above exposition that Bhaṭṭar lays emphasis on the Lord’s redemptive grace besides sharing the view of the other Acāryas, so far as the Āḻvār’s ecstatic experience is concerned.




## 1.10.1
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

பொருமா நீள் படை ஆழி சங்கத்தொடு,  
திருமா நீள் கழல் ஏழ் உலகும் தொழ,  
ஒரு மாணிக் குறள் ஆகி, நிமிர்ந்த, அக்  
கரு மாணிக்கம் என் கண்ணுளது ஆகுமே.

porumā nīḷ paṭai āḻi caṅkattoṭu,  
tirumā nīḷ kaḻal ēḻ ulakum toḻa,  
oru māṇik kuṟaḷ āki, nimirnta, ak  
karu māṇikkam eṉ kaṇṇuḷatu ākumē.

**English translation of verse 1.10.1:**

The peerless Vamāna bearing the martial conch and discus,  
The majestic weapons, Whose feet, long and lovely,  
All the seven worlds worshipped, as He grew into space,  
That blue-gem of a Lord is unto me visible!

**Note**

Even in his dreams, Mahābali had not conjured up the vision of the charming Lord presenting Himself before him, in all His grandeur and asking for a gift. Likewise, the Āḻvār had not the remotest idea that the Lord would ever come to him and reveal His exquisite charm to his naked eyes. No wonder then, he goes into raptures over the Lord’s spontaneous grace. This is indeed the key stanza for this decad.




## 1.10.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கண்ணுள்ளே நிற்கும் காதன்மையால் தொழில்,  
எண்ணிலும் வரும் என் இனி வேண்டுவம்?  
மண்ணும் நீரும் எரியும் நல் வாயுவும்  
விண்ணும் ஆய் விரியும் எம் பிரானையே.

kaṇṇuḷḷē niṟkum kātaṉmaiyāl toḻil,  
eṇṇilum varum eṉ iṉi vēṇṭuvam?  
maṇṇum nīrum eriyum nal vāyuvum  
viṇṇum āy viriyum em pirāṉaiyē.

**English translation of verse 1.10.2:**

My Lord hath as His body the elements five  
And as the sprawling Universe expands; worshipped with love  
He makes Himself visible, nay, for the mere count.  
What more does one (for salvation) want?

**Notes**

\(i\) It is by no means surprising that the Lord Who is bound by the deep love of the devotees, always keeps Himself in their vicinity. But the Āḻvār now touches upon the Lord’s overwhelming generosity in presenting Himself even to those who utter the number twenty-six, in the course of casual enumeration. The non-sentient body has 24 ingredients, such as Mind, senses, tanmātrās etc; the sentient soul which takes possession of the body and directs it, is the 25th tattva (principle) and the Lord is the 26th tattva, controlling, as He does, both the body and the Soul which constitute, as it were, His bodies. This explains the significance of number 26, denoting the Lord.

\(ii\) The Āḻvār exclaims: “When the Lord can be got at even by casual enumeration, what more do we need for our salvation?” By this, he means that God’s grace is the sole means of salvation and nothing is needed on our part. There are no special conditions supporting His grace which operates unasked and unaided. What is wanted is non-resistance or nonrejection when Grace is offered. When it was pointed out to the great Ācārya, Nampiḷḷai, by one of his disciples, named, Vēlveṭṭippiḷḷai that Śrī Rāma offered Śaraṇāgati to the king of the oceans, facing east and observing other ritualistic formalities, the learned Preceptor elucidated that it was done so by Śrī Rāma as a matter of course, in keeping with his orthodox background and not as something mandatory. As a matter of fact, Śrī Rāma resorted to the said ‘Śaraṇā-gati’ only on the advice of Vibhīṣaṇa who, however, did not have a single dip in the ocean before he sought asylum at the feet of Śrī Rāma. The lesson to be learnt from this contrasting picture is that ‘Śaraṇāgati’ (surrender to the Lord’s loving grace) could be performed iṇ any manner, with or without a bath, the one who hasn’t had his bath already, not being under any compulsion to take a bath and, conversely, the one who has had his bath already, need not defile himself by way of emulating the former.




## 1.10.3
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

எம்பிரானை எந்தை தந்தை தந்தைக்கும்-  
தம்பிரானை, தண் தாமரைக் கண்ணனை,  
கொம்பு அராவு நுண் நேர் இடை மார்பனை,  
எம்பிரானைத் தொழாய் மட நெஞ்சமே.

empirāṉai entai tantai tantaikkum-  
tampirāṉai, taṇ tāmaraik kaṇṇaṉai,  
kompu arāvu nuṇ nēr iṭai mārpaṉai,  
empirāṉait toḻāy maṭa neñcamē.

**English translation of verse 1.10.3:**

My docile mind! bow unto the Benefactor great  
Of our entire clan, the lotus-eyed Lord,  
Shedding cool grace, bearing on His winsome chest,  
The Mother Divine, lovely and thin-waisted.

**Note**

The Lord’s tender solicitude for the devotees, overlooking their countless transgressions, springs from His close contact with the Divine Mother who is the very personification of grace.




## 1.10.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நெஞ்சமே நல்லை நல்லை உன்னைப் பெற்றால்-  
என் செய்யோம்? இனி என்ன குறைவினம்?  
மைந்தனை மலராள் மணவாளனைத்,  
துஞ்சும்போதும் விடாது தொடர்கண்டாய்.

neñcamē nallai nallai uṉṉaip peṟṟāl-  
eṉ ceyyōm? iṉi eṉṉa kuṟaiviṉam?  
maintaṉai malarāḷ maṇavāḷaṉait,  
tuñcumpōtum viṭātu toṭarkaṇṭāy.

**English translation of verse 1.10.4:**

Well done, my mind! what is there  
We can’t secure when you are here?  
Well, is there anything we would want anymore?  
Malarāḷ’s (Lotus-born Lakṣmī’s) Consort, ever young,  
Leave not, even if you find me straying.

**Note**

The Āḻvār’s mind exhorted by him in the preceding stanza to worship the Lord, responded so well that he now pats it on its back and prays that it shall cling to the Lord under all circumstances. The Āḻvār apprehends the off-chance of his shrinking back from the Lord once again, when his own humility haunts him, in dire contrast to the Lord’s overwhelming superiority. Right now, the Āḻvār counsels his mind, never to get parted from the Lord, whatever might be his own vicissitudes,




## 1.10.5
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கண்டாயே நெஞ்சே கருமங்கள் வாய்க்கின்று, ஓர்  
எண் தானும் இன்றியே வந்து இயலுமாறு,  
உண்டானை உலகு ஏழும் ஓர் மூவடி  
கொண்டானைக், கண்டுகொண்டனை நீயுமே.

kaṇṭāyē neñcē karumaṅkaḷ vāykkiṉṟu, ōr  
eṇ tāṉum iṉṟiyē vantu iyalumāṟu,  
uṇṭāṉai ulaku ēḻum ōr mūvaṭi  
koṇṭāṉaik, kaṇṭukoṇṭaṉai nīyumē.

**English translation of verse 1.10.5:**

Haven’t you seen, my mind! how things occur,  
With no pre-thoughts in us? did the worlds seven  
Know that the Lord would, during deluge, sustain  
Them all? Who knew that the Lord would measure  
The worlds in three strides and set His feet on them?  
Well, did you ever know that you would see Him?

**Note**

The Lord extends His grace out of His own sweet will, unasked and un-premeditated by us. It is this spontaneous grace of the Lord that Bhaṭṭar has emphasised all along in this decad.




## 1.10.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நீயும் நானும் இந் நேர்நிற்கில், மேல்மற்றோர்.  
நோயும் சார்கொடான் நெஞ்சமே சொன்னேன்,  
தாயும் தந்தையும் ஆய் இவ் உலகினில்,  
வாயும் ஈசன் மணிவண்ணன் எந்தையே.

nīyum nāṉum in nērniṟkil, mēlmaṟṟōr.  
nōyum cārkoṭāṉ neñcamē coṉṉēṉ,  
tāyum tantaiyum āy iv ulakiṉil,  
vāyum īcaṉ maṇivaṇṇaṉ entaiyē.

**English translation of verse 1.10.6:**

My mind! if you and J continue in this state,  
Our sapphire—hued Lord, Master of all,  
Who is our Father and Mother as well,  
Will rid us of all ills, kt me truly state.

**Note**

Addressing his mind, the Āḻvār says: “Our eternal Lord Who endears Himself to us like the Mother, whose love is proverbial, chastises like the Father, bent upon reforming us, revealed His resplendent form like unto a sapphire and enthralled me. If you and 1 persevere in this state, the Lord will see to it that we enjoy this perennial bliss for all time, keeping away all ills and evils”.




## 1.10.7
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

எந்தையே என்றும் எம் பெருமான் என்றும்,  
சிந்தையுள் வைப்பன் சொல்லுவன் பாவியேன்,  
எந்தை எம் பெருமான் என்று வானவர்,  
சிந்தையுள் வைத்துச் சொல்லும் செல்வனையே.

entaiyē eṉṟum em perumāṉ eṉṟum,  
cintaiyuḷ vaippaṉ colluvaṉ pāviyēṉ,  
entai em perumāṉ eṉṟu vāṉavar,  
cintaiyuḷ vaittuc collum celvaṉaiyē.

**English translation of verse 1.10.7:**

The Sovereign Lord, the Celestials contemplate  
And sing His glory as their Progenitor (Primate);  
How dare I, a sinner, likewise meditate  
And call Him my Father, my Master and all that?

**Note**

The Scriptures warn that one shall not utter anything ominous (inauspicious), Jest it should actually come to pass. In the fourth stanza of this decad, the Āḻvār, while exhorting his mind, apprehended the frightful possibility of his moving away from the Lord, haunted by his own lowliness. And here we find him suffering from that obsession again and so soon!




## 1.10.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

செல்வ நாரணன் என்ற சொல் கேட்டலும்,  
மல்கும் கண்பனி நாடுவன் மாயமே,  
அல்லும் நன்பகலும் இடைவீடு இன்றி,  
நல்கி என்னை விடான் நம்பி நம்பியே.

celva nāraṇaṉ eṉṟa col kēṭṭalum,  
malkum kaṇpaṉi nāṭuvaṉ māyamē,  
allum naṉpakalum iṭaivīṭu iṉṟi,  
nalki eṉṉai viṭāṉ nampi nampiyē.

**English translation of verse 1.10.8:**

‘Celvanāraṇaṉ,’ the word uttered by some one.  
Heard I, and lo! with tears my eyes did run;  
Searched I whither He is gone, oh, what a marvel!  
Thro’ friendly days and nights with no interval.  
The perfect Lord, full of grace, tries to win  
My love and elects with me ever to remain.

**Note**

“How unworthy and unbecoming,” the Āḻvār rattled, “would be the union of one so vile and abject like me and the Supreme Lord, pure and exalted beyond words!” And so, he fled away and hid himself behind a ruined wall, in a remote corner, with little or no scope of hearing and talking about God-head. Thus he would forget all about God and, as a further precaution against possible detection and intrusion on his privacy, he even put a veil over his head. But what happened? A wayfarer, with a heavy headload, rested a while there, after unburdening himself. While discharging the load, he ejaculated ‘Śrīman Nārāyaṉa [Nārāyaṇa]’! in a relaxing mood. The moment this magic word struck the ears of the Āḻvār, he got himself transformed into the ecstatic state, described in this stanza, as above. The Saint was indeed most agreeably surprised that the Lord should shed on him His grace and affection in such super-abundance and reclaim him despite his determination to forget all about Him, for fear of tainting Him. Oh, what a grip the Lord has over His chosen subjects!




## 1.10.9
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நம்பியை தென் குறுங்குடி நின்ற, அச்  
செம்பொனே திகழும் திரு மூர்த்தியை,  
உம்பர் வானவர் ஆதி அம் சோதியை,  
எம் பிரானை என் சொல்லி மறப்பனோ?

nampiyai teṉ kuṟuṅkuṭi niṉṟa, ac  
cempoṉē tikaḻum tiru mūrttiyai,  
umpar vāṉavar āti am cōtiyai,  
em pirāṉai eṉ colli maṟappaṉō?

**English translation of verse 1.10.9:**

On what pretext shall 1 forget my Lord of dazzling charm.  
The Progenitor of the exalted denizens of heaven,  
The perfect Lord Who, in Tentirukkuṟuṅkuṭi stands  
With an exquisite Form that does like red gold gleam?

**Notes**

\(i\) Asked whether he would not forget the Lord like the worldlings and go in pursuit of food and raiment, the Āḻvār says, he just does not know how and on what grounds he can forget the Lord. By exhibiting His exquisite charm in His Arcā form at Tirukkuṟuṅkuṭi (deep down, in Tamil Nadu), He enthralled the Āḻvār. How then could he forget Him? Could it be on the ground that He is not perfect, that He is not near at hand, that His form is not attractive, that He is not exalted, that He does not extend any benefits? No, none of these grounds will hold good, as could be seen from this stanza.

\(ii\) The Lord, in His Arcā (Iconic) form in Tirukkuṟuṅkuṭi, is referred to as the perfect one in whom all the auspicious qualities converge in a perfect measure. No doubt, the qualities of saulabhya (easy accessibility), Sauśīlya (condescension), Vātsalya (tender solicitude) etc. are also displayed by the Lord in His ‘Para’ or transcendent form in the High Heavens. But, in that land of perfect bliss and perpetual splendour, these qualities can be hardly perceptible in such a marked degree as they are in this land of darkness, delusion and despair. There is all the difference between a light burning in broad day light and the one shining forth in a dark room. (Iṭu)




## 1.10.10
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மறப்பும் ஞானமும் நான் ஒன்று உணர்ந்திலன்,  
மறக்கும் என்று செந்தாமரைக் கண்ணொடு,  
மறப்பு அற என் உள்ளே மன்னினான் தன்னை,  
மறப்பனோ? இனி யான் என் மணியையே.

maṟappum ñāṉamum nāṉ oṉṟu uṇarntilaṉ,  
maṟakkum eṉṟu centāmaraik kaṇṇoṭu,  
maṟappu aṟa eṉ uḷḷē maṉṉiṉāṉ taṉṉai,  
maṟappaṉō? iṉi yāṉ eṉ maṇiyaiyē.

**English translation of verse 1.10.10:**

I know not what it is to feel or forget  
And yet, the Lord, with red-lotus-eyes, does apprehend  
That I’ll forget Him and, as one forewarned,  
He has lodged Himself firm in my heart;  
The gem of a Lord, shall I any more forget?

**Notes**

\(i\) The Āḻvār feels that he is incapable of thinking and there is, therefore, no question of his forgetting either. The Lord is, however, anxious that the knowledge now dawned on the Āḻvār as a result of His union with him, should remain intact, leaving ṇo more scope for his sliding down or slipping off. He has, therefore, lodged Himself firmly inside the Āḻvār, casting His benevolent glances on him.

\(ii\) Who will cast away a priceless gem when it comes to one’s hand, instead of treasuring it and enjoying it all the time?




## 1.10.11
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மணியை வானவர் கண்ணனை தன்னது ஓர்-  
அணியை, தென் குருகூர்ச் சடகோபன், சொல்  
பணிசெய் ஆயிரத்துள் இவை பத்துடன்,  
தணிவிலர் கற்பரேல், கல்வி வாயுமே.

maṇiyai vāṉavar kaṇṇaṉai taṉṉatu ōr-  
aṇiyai, teṉ kurukūrc caṭakōpaṉ, col  
paṇicey āyirattuḷ ivai pattuṭaṉ,  
taṇivilar kaṟparēl, kalvi vāyumē.

**English translation of verse 1.10.11:**

Those that learn with zeal and thirst insatiable these songs ten,  
Out of the thousand sung by Tenkurukūr Caṭakōpaṉ,  
As a matter of service unto the Lord of sapphire hue,  
Himself a jewel unique, overlord of the Celestials,  
Will with knowledge divine be filled.

**Notes**

\(i\) In accordance with the text of the song, those that learn these ten songs will have their fill of knowledge. The ultimate aim of knowledge is Divine Service and so, this knowledge should blossom into service.

\(ii\) The blue-gem is likened to the Lord in a number of ways. In it, there is a happy blending, as in the case of the supreme Lord, of ‘Paratva’ and ‘Saulabhya’, the two extremes of paramountcy and simplicity. With all its high intrinsic value, the gem can be easily carried, tied at one end of the garment”.

\(iii\) It is common knowledge that jewels beautify the wearer. In the case of the Lord, however. He beautifies the jewels worn by Him and He is Himself the most attractive of all jewels.




## Retrospective Summary
(1-1): Right in the opening line of the first song of the first decad, Saint Nammāḻvār characterises God as one with perfections, ail of the nature of inexhaustible bliss and love, the natural repository of innumerable auspicious traits of unlimited dimensions. The Āḻvār gratefully revels in the blissful knowledge of the Supreme Lord, shorn of all doubts, discrepancies and deviations, dowered on him by the Lord Himself, in the exercise of His spontaneous grace and exhorts his mind to take refuge in the Lord’s distress-dispelling, dazzling feet, being the sure and certain means of salvation. The Lord’s greatness and transcedent glory, elucidated in the *opening decad* have been briefly set out below. He is at once the Material Cause as well as the Operative Cause and Instrumental Cause of all life and being; He is the one and only Giver either directly or through other minor deities, whose favours their respective votaries seek; He is all-pervading like the Soul inside the body;

(1-2): Far from being selfish and self-centred, the Āḻvār wishes to share with his fellow beings, wallowing in the stye of wordly life, all that knowledge graciously dowered on him by the Lord. He, therefore, exhorts them, *in the second decad*, to give up the elusive and obnoxious pleasures of worldly life, disengage themselves from the erroneous notions of ‘I’ and ‘Mine’ and dedicate themselves to the appreciation of the limitless wealth and splendour of the Supreme Lord, thereby reaping the rich harvest of eternal bliss and beatitude. True renunciation is of the mind, as distinguished from mere bodily replacements, such as living a secluded life in a remote forest. In this, his first address to the fellow-beings, the Āḻvār also teaches them how and where to pray, by giving out the substance of the eight-syllabled ‘Tirumantra’—Aunt Namo (Nārāyaṇāya);

(1-3): Lest his addressees in the preceding decad be scared of the Lord’s sovereignty as the Supreme Master of the whole universe, the Āḻvār puts them at ease by depicting, *in the third decad*, the Lord’s disarming simplicity and His easy-accessibility (Saulabhya) and emphasising that, to those who turn their minds unto Him, He is easily accessible but difficult of attainment by others;

(1-4): *In the fourth decad*, the Āḻvār is seen transformed (figuratively of course) as a ‘Nāyakī’ (female lover) pining for immediate union with the Supreme Lord and sending some birds, as her emissaries, to the Lord reclining on the ‘Milk-ocean’, the seat of the Lord’s creative activity, invoking His trait of forgiveness (aparāda sahatva). (The winged birds typify the efficient preceptors, possessed of the mighty wings of knowledge (Jñāna) and conduct (anuṣṭāna), a happy blending of both. (This is the first of four such decads in the entire hymnal, the other three being VI-I, VI-8 and IX-7.)

(1-5): The Saint brings into focus, the Lord’s trait of loving condescension (Sauśīlya) or mixing freely with the lowliest, *in the fifth decad*; the Lord, bent upon having a rapport with the Āḻvār, shakes off the latter’s inferiority complex inducing him, quite often, to retreat from the Lord for fear of defiling One, so exalted.

(1-6): The Lord’s ‘Svārādhatva’ (easy worshippability) is emphasised *in the sixth decad*; the outward offerings may be trifles but, in God’s eyes, they carry much weight, when offered in humility, with loving devotion;

(1-7): Easy-worshippability apart, the Lord is highly adorable because of His extraordinary sweetness; this is highlighted by the Āḻvār, *in the seventh decad*;

(1-8): *in the eighth decad*, the Āḻvār brings to the fore, the Lord’s trait of uprightness (ārjava or rujuḥ) His transparence in word, deed and thought, free from sophistry, duplicity, mental reservation, mischievous distortion, etc.;

(1-9): The Omniscient Lord regulates the influx of His grace in such a manner that the recipient is able to stomach it all right. *In the ninth decad*, as well as the fifth decad of the fourth centum, according to the Āḻvār’s own admission, the Lord unfolds unto him, His glorious traits and wondrous deeds, only by stages, consistent with his capacity for in-take (Sātmia bhoga pradatva). Being the last of the staggering series of bodies donned by the Āḻvār, in which alone the Lord could reclaim him, He naturally covets his body. And yet, He would not jump straightaway into the crown of the Āḻvār’s head; He would first stand close to him, get into his hip and thence move upwards, limb by limb. Had the Lord not adopted this process of gradual occupation of the Āḻvār’s body, the latter would have just collapsed, like unto a pauper from birth, who suddenly comes by a sizeable treasure;

(1-10): *In the concluding) decad of this centum*, the Lord’s voluntary or Spontaneous grace (nirhetuka kṛpā) is brought out prominently and extolled by the Āḻvār who also gives vent to his boundless joy resulting from the Lord’s contact with him, limb by limb, as set out in the ninth decad.
