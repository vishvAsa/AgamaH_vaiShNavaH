## 00 Intro9.7
The bliss enjoyed by the Āḻvār in this decad, stands on a pedestal of its own. It can even be asserted that there is no comparable decad in the whole hymnal.

When one pauses and ponders which indeed is the greater of the two pulls, namely, the Lord’s effort to get at the Āḻvār and the Āḻvār’s desire to get at Him, it will be seen that the Lord exerts the greater, naturally, the stronger pull, His desire to get at the subject, His coveted belonging, being supreme. Did He not declare, in His ‘Song Celestial’, that the gnostic, who knows Him truly, is undoubtedly responsible for His very existence and that it is very hard to find a truly discerning devotee who looks upon Him as everything, the highest goal, the Sole Means, Father, Mother, Friend. Refuge, Resting place etc.? It is, therefore, abundantly clear that the Lord considers it His greatest gain to reclaim a Jīva (individual soul) and, to this end, He goes on preparing the ground, all the time. His intense longing to get at the individual Soul is virtually the copper plate, establishing His right of ownership over the subject, sought to be reclaimed. And, therefore, the Lord mingles with the Āḻvār with such an inordinate longing. Noticing this, the Āḻvār realises with a stinging sense of shame that he had tried to reverse the role by begging of the Lord for his redemption overlooking the fact that it was the Lord who was all along been the supplicant for the Āḻvār’s love unto Hirn. The Āḻvār acknowledges in this decad with great feeling the enormous love bestowed by the Lord on the individual Soul, as the indefatigable cultivator of God-love in the latter.




## 8.7.1
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

இருத்தும் வியந்து என்னைத் தன் பொன்அடிக்கீழ் என்று  
அருத்தித்து எனைத்துஓர் பலநாள் அழைத்தேற்கு  
பொருத்தம்உடை வாமனன்தான் புகுந்து என்தன்

iruttum viyantu eṉṉait taṉ poṉaṭikkīḻ eṉṟu

poruttamuṭai vāmaṉaṉtāṉ pukuntu eṉtaṉ

**English translation of verse 8.7.1:**

Vāmaṉaṉ, my Lord, Whose grace I invoked, days on end,  
To lift me unto His golden feet, has, I find,  
Been very Keen Himself to get hold of me and now come  
Right inside me, looking at me, all the time.

**Notes:**

The Āḻvār was beseeching the Lord all along, panting and craving for Him, to come and reign in his heart. This was indeed superfluous for the Lord is even more enamoured of the Āḻvār and He has, all the time, been looking forward to getting hold of the Āḻvār and being firmly lodged in his heart. And now, He has got inside the Āḻvār and He keeps looking at him with doting love, like unto a father who keeps looking at his beloved son, just recovered from a dire disease generally known to be fatal. As a matter of fact, the Āḻvār has survived the deep yearning of his, in VIII-5 (Māyakkūttā) to which he could have as well succumbed. Even as the Lord, as Vāmana, sought out Mahābali and snatched away his possessions, the Lord sought the Āḻvār and took over from him, his deep longing, and with a longing of even greater intensity, He took hold of the Āḻvār and got inside him.




## 8.7.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

இருந்தான் கண்டுகொண்டு எனதுஏழை நெஞ்சுஆளும்  
திருந்தாத ஓர்ஐவரைத் தேய்ந்துஅறமன்னி  
பெரும்தாள் களிற்றுக்கு அருள்செய்த பெருமான்  
தரும்தான் அருள்தான் இனியான் அறியேனே. (2)

iruntāṉ kaṇṭukoṇṭu eṉatuēḻai neñcuāḷum  
tiruntāta ōraivarait tēyntuaṟamaṉṉi  
perumtāḷ kaḷiṟṟukku aruḷceyta perumāṉ  
tarumtāṉ aruḷtāṉ iṉiyāṉ aṟiyēṉē. (2)

**English translation of verse 8.7.2:**

The Lord’s grace unto the elephant, with feet large,  
Does in my eyes no longer loom large,  
For standing within me, firmly lodged,  
He has worn down to naught the cruel senses five,  
Which had kept my fickle mind in their grip tight  
And He now keeps gazing at me, all the time.

**Notes:**

What the Lord did unto the Āḻvār was to destroy his formidable opponents, the five senses and wean him away from their mischief by exhibiting His charming beauty.

In the case of Gajendra, the elephant, it was, no doubt, a long and grim struggle but it was just an encounter with a single crocodile, as against the five crocodiles, the five formidable senses, the Āḻvār was pitted against. And then, the venue was a mere pond in the case of Gajendra, whereas it was the vast ocean of Saṃsāra in which the Āḻvār was caught up. Again, Gajendra’s struggle with the crocodile lasted a bare thousand years, while the Āḻvār’s grim battle with life went right through a staggering past. Further, the Lord has got right inside the Āḻvār and keeps on looking at him with the same avidity with which a pauper from generations, keeps gazing at his new-found treasure. It has been said in Rāmāyaṇa that, after Śrī Rāma befriended Sugrīva, the monkey king, the two of them used to sit gazing at each other with insatiable joy, days on end. There at least, it was a sort of mutual pact, what could be termed as complimentary roles. In the case of the Lord’s help to the Āḻvār, however, it was all one-sided with no obligation on the Āḻvār. All these go to enhance the Lord’s grace unto the Āḻvār mani-fold and make the Lord’s succour of Gajendra, the elephant, pale into insignificance.




## 8.7.3
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அருள்தான் இனியான் அறியேன் அவன்என்உள்  
இருள்தான்அற வீற்றிருந்தான் இதுஅல்லால்  
பொருள் தான்எனில் மூவுலகும் பொருளல்ல  
மருள்தான் ஈதோ? மாயமயக்கு மயக்கே.

aruḷtāṉ iṉiyāṉ aṟiyēṉ avaṉeṉuḷ  
iruḷtāṉaṟa vīṟṟiruntāṉ ituallāl  
poruḷ tāṉeṉil mūvulakum poruḷalla  
maruḷtāṉ ītō? māyamayakku mayakkē.

**English translation of verse 8.7.3:**

Indeed, I know of no grace but that of the Lord.  
Who does inside me stay, dispelling the darkness within;  
It seems I am unto Him the sole concern,  
He values not so much even His overlordship of the three worlds.  
Is it yet another mystery of His or a mere illusion?

**Notes:**

Overwhelmed by the immensity of the Lord’s love unto him, the Āḻvār feels it to be too good to be true and even suspects that it might be just an illusion.

In the preceding song, the Āḻvār deemed it an incomparable act of grace galore, on the part of the Lord to have subjugated his unrelenting senses and destroyed them. But now, he says even that dwindles down before the loving condescension with which He has got Himself lodged in the Āḻvār’s heart, dispelling its erstwhile darkness. What is more, the Lord’s condescension is full and complete, seeing that, in His boundless love for the Āḻvār, He has relegated even His overlordship of the Universe to a secondary place. In his unique diction, Nampiḻḷai puts it, that the Āḻvār says here “Alas! the Lord had kept me in a state of bewilderment all along, caught up in the vortex of ‘Prakṛti’ (Māyā) and now again. He keeps me bewildered by His extra-ordinary love unto me.”




## 8.7.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மாயமயக்கு மயக்கான் என்னை வஞ்சித்து  
ஆயன் அமரர்க்கு அரிஏறு எனதுஅம்மான்  
தூய சுடர்ச்சோதி தனதுஎன்னுள் வைத்தான்  
தேசம் திகழும் தன்திருவருள் செய்தே.

māyamayakku mayakkāṉ eṉṉai vañcittu  
āyaṉ amararkku ariēṟu eṉatuammāṉ  
tūya cuṭarccōti taṉatueṉṉuḷ vaittāṉ  
tēcam tikaḻum taṉtiruvaruḷ ceytē.

**English translation of verse 8.7.4:**

The Divine Cowherd of limitless glory, even Celestials can’t comprehend,  
Has unto me displayed His grace galore of universal fame,  
His resplendent Form immaculate, He has in my heart planted firm,  
A solid reality this is and not an illusion, as I did apprehend.

**Notes:**

The Āḻvār is now quite clear in his mind, that the Lord is really regaling in his heart and avers that it is a matter beyond doubt. As a matter of fact, in His unbounded love for the Āḻvār, the immaculate Lord has set His dazzling feet, dispelling darkness and distress, inside the Āḻvār, keeping all the worlds spell-bound by this act of grace galore. Surely, He would not play ducks and drakes with His devotees and bewilder them, as He did in the case of the ungodly Duryodhana and others of his ilk.




## 8.7.5
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

திகழும்தன் திருவருள் செய்து உலகத்தார்-  
புகழும் புகழ் தானதுகாட்டித் தந்து என்உள்-  
திகழும் மணிக்குன்றம்ஒன்றே ஒத்துநின்றான்  
புகழும் புகழ் மற்றுஎனக்கும் ஓர்பொருளே?

tikaḻumtaṉ tiruvaruḷ ceytu ulakattār-  
pukaḻum pukaḻ tāṉatukāṭṭit tantu eṉuḷ-  
tikaḻum maṇikkuṉṟamoṉṟē ottuniṉṟāṉ  
pukaḻum pukaḻ maṟṟueṉakkum ōrporuḷē?

**English translation of verse 8.7.5:**

Nothing more praiseworthy do I deem than the grace radiant,  
Shed by the Lord, gleaming inside me like an emerald mount  
And revealing to me the praises of the inhabitants  
Of the worlds, heaped on Him, on this account.

**Notes:**

“Is there indeed anything more praise-worthy than this superabundant grace of the Lord in standing within me firmly, gleaming like an emerald mount?”, asks the Āḻvār, Again, this grace is twice-blest, in that the Lord feels exultant over the bestowal of His grace on the Āḻvār and the latter is also bubbling with jubilation over his being the object of the Lord’s extra-ordinary love. And yet another phase, the third one is the chorus of praise sung by all the worlds for this act of grace galore on the part of the Lord and what is even more impressive is the revelation of this fact to the Āḻvār by the Lord Himself.




## 8.7.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

பொருள்மற்றுஎனக்கும் ஓர்பொருள்தன்னில் சீர்க்கத்  
தருமேல் பின்னையார்க்குஅவன் தன்னைக் கொடுக்கும்?  
கருமாணிக்கக் குன்றத்துத் தாமரைபோல்  
திருமார்பு கால்கண்கை செவ்வாய் உந்தியானே.

poruḷmaṟṟueṉakkum ōrporuḷtaṉṉil cīrkkat  
tarumēl piṉṉaiyārkkuavaṉ taṉṉaik koṭukkum?  
karumāṇikkak kuṉṟattut tāmaraipōl  
tirumārpu kālkaṇkai cevvāy untiyāṉē.

**English translation of verse 8.7.6:**

If the Lord, whose winsome chest and other limbs  
Do a cluster of lotus flowers blooming on emerald mount resemble,  
Were on me to bestow lesser gains, short of He Himself,  
Is there at all any other to whom He will give of Himself?

**Notes:**

\(i\) There are two broad groups of the Lord’s votaries, namely, those who ask of Him boons like acquisition of wealth, freedom from rebirth and so on, while those in the other group seek none but the Lord Himself. The Āḻvār falls in the latter group, no doubt, and yet, if the Lord has given Himself unto the Āḻvār, it is because of His inordinate love for the Āḻvār and not because there are no other like-minded votaries in that group.

\(ii\) The enchanting description of the Lord’s exquisite charm, as set out, in detail, in the original text of this song, does not stem so much from the Lord’s natural charm as from the extra lustre and grandeur imparted to His whole Form, limb by limb, by His union with the Āḻvār.

\(iii\) Reference to the lotus flowers blooming on the crest of an emerald mount is a grand piece of poetic imagery, flight of poetic fancy.




## 8.7.7
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

செவ்வாய்உந்தி வெண்பல் சுடர்க்குழை தம்மோடு  
எவ்வாய்ச் சுடரும் தம்மில்முன்வளாய்க் கொள்ள  
செவ்வாய் முறுவலோடு எனதுஉள்ளத்துஇருந்த  
அவ்வாயன்றி யான் அறியேன் மற்றுஅருளே.

cevvāyunti veṇpal cuṭarkkuḻai tammōṭu  
evvāyc cuṭarum tammilmuṉvaḷāyk koḷḷa  
cevvāy muṟuvalōṭu eṉatuuḷḷattuirunta  
avvāyaṉṟi yāṉ aṟiyēṉ maṟṟuaruḷē.

**English translation of verse 8.7.7:**

The Lord’s mouth red, the navel, the teeth sparkling white,  
The earlobes with pearls bedecked and all other limbs bright  
Do vie with each other to attract me all right,  
But I can think of nothing but the grace of the Lord Who stays  
In my heart with beaming smile which on His red lips plays.

**Notes:**

Although the Lord’s limbs vie with each other in casting their fascinating spell on the Āḻvār in whose heart the Lord is now lodged, His bewitching smiles, revealing His great delight in mingling with the Āḻvār, are said to attract him most. Consequently, his mind is solely fixed on these ravishing smiles and the Lord’s unique grace. Like unto the flower in fresh bloom, the Lord’s radiant smile illumines His entire Form, limb by limb.




## 8.7.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அறியேன் மற்றருள் என்னைஆளும் பிரானார்  
வெறிதே அருள்செய்வர் செய்வார்கட்கு உகந்து  
சிறியேனுடைச் சிந்தையுள் மூவுலகும் தன்  
நெறியா வயிற்றில்கொண்டு நின்றொழிந்தாரே.

aṟiyēṉ maṟṟaruḷ eṉṉaiāḷum pirāṉār  
veṟitē aruḷceyvar ceyvārkaṭku ukantu  
ciṟiyēṉuṭaic cintaiyuḷ mūvulakum taṉ  
neṟiyā vayiṟṟilkoṇṭu niṉṟoḻintārē.

**English translation of verse 8.7.8:**

I know of no other benefaction but the stay of the Lord.  
Within my frail heart, keeping in His stomach all the three worlds,  
Well *in tact*; unto those of His choice, He, who has me enthralled,  
Does His grace solely extend, out of His own accord.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The Āḻvār expatiates on the Lord’s sweet, spontaneous grace (nirhetuka kṛpā) inasmuch as the grace, with which He has now flooded him, is itself a matter of such voluntary grace. The Lord of the universe has shifted the venue of His vast governance to the heart-region of the Āḻvār. What else is this but the Lord’s spontaneous grace and is there at all any need to adduce any other example? In this song, the Āḻvār thus pin points the Lord’s spontaneous grace, extolling the Lord as one, who sheds His voluntary grace on those whom He singles out for such favours and has thus chosen to get Himself firmly lodged in the Āḻvār’s mind. While the Āḻvār looks upon himself, as the lowliest of the lowly, the Lord regards him as one far more precious than all the worlds put together.

\(ii\) In the hymns of the Āḻvār where the Lord’s grace is expounded there might appear to be mutual contradictions in some places to the superficial reader, but a critical and cogent study will remove such doubts. This position has been thrashed out in aphorisms 393 and 394 of “Śrīvacana Bhūṣaṇam”; the reader is invited to study either the original text or the English rendering thereof by the author of this work.




## 8.7.9
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வயிற்றில் கொண்டு நின்றொழிந்தாரும் எவரும்  
வயிற்றில் கொண்டு நின்று ஒருமூவுலகும் தம்  
வயிற்றில் கொண்டு நின்றவண்ணம் நின்றமாலை  
வயிற்றில் கொண்டு மன்னவைத்தேன் மதியாலே.

vayiṟṟil koṇṭu niṉṟoḻintārum evarum  
vayiṟṟil koṇṭu niṉṟu orumūvulakum tam  
vayiṟṟil koṇṭu niṉṟavaṇṇam niṉṟamālai  
vayiṟṟil koṇṭu maṉṉavaittēṉ matiyālē.

**English translation of verse 8.7.9:**

The Lord, Who, in His stomach, holds with no effort,  
The earthly rulers who, in their stomachs, keep their subjects,  
The exalted Celestials and the worlds three,  
I have consented to get firmly inside me.

**Notes**

\(i\) To a question, doggedly put to him, suggesting that there ought to be some merit in him for the Lord to bestow on him His grace, of such a magnitude, the Alvar says that the only merit in him is his passive quiescence or mere non-resistance to the influx of His grace. To those sticklers, who have a fad for bargaining and would, therefore, insist upon making the influx of the Lord’s grace contingent upon some kind of initiative in us, the Āḻvār’s own utterances should serve as the eye-opener. Even this consent to the Lord’s reclamation is induced by the Lord’s grace. Therefore it is, this hymnal is replete with expressions like: “Oh, Sire, You have lifted me unto Your holy feet, after duy moulding and reconditioning my mind, so as not to stifle your effort to redeem me”. See also the elucidation in aphorism 110 of ‘Ācārya Hṛdayam’.

\(ii\) By the earthly kings holding, in their stomachs, their subjects, is meant the protection extended by the former to the latter like unto the mother feeding the babe inside her womb. The Lord’s retention, in His stomach, of the exalted Celestials and all the worlds with their contents, also denotes His role, as the universal Protector, a function which He discharges through a mere fraction of His resolve.




## 8.7.10
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வைத்தேன் மதியால் எனதுஉள்ளத்துஅகத்தே  
எய்த்தே ஒழிவேன்அல்லேன் என்றும் எப்போதும்  
மொய்த்துஏய்திரை மோது தண்பாற் கடலுளால்  
பைத்துஏய் சுடர்ப்பாம்பணை நம்பரனையே

vaittēṉ matiyāl eṉatuuḷḷattuakattē  
eyttē oḻivēṉallēṉ eṉṟum eppōtum  
moyttuēytirai mōtu taṇpāṟ kaṭaluḷāl  
paittuēy cuṭarppāmpaṇai namparaṉaiyē

**English translation of verse 8.7.10:**

The Lord, who has the hooded serpent bright,  
As His somnolent bed on the cool, milk ocean,  
With surging waters, I have got fixed in my heart,  
Suffer shall I no more from pangs of separation.

**Notes:**

Mere passive quiescence on the part of the Āḻvār has resulted in the Lord entering him, with all His retinue. Naturally, this has infused in the Āḻvār robust confidence that he shall no more suffer from the pangs of separation from the Lord.




## 8.7.11
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

சுடர்ப்பாம்பணை நம்பரனை திருமாலை  
அடிச்சேர்வகை வண்குருகூர்ச் சடகோபன்  
முடிப்பான் சொன்னஆயிரத்து இப்பத்தும் சன்மம்  
விடத் தேய்ந்தற நோக்கும் தன்கண்கள் சிவந்தே (2)

cuṭarppāmpaṇai namparaṉai tirumālai  
aṭiccērvakai vaṇkurukūrc caṭakōpaṉ  
muṭippāṉ coṉṉaāyirattu ippattum caṉmam  
viṭat tēyntaṟa nōkkum taṉkaṇkaḷ civantē (2)

**English translation of verse 8.7.11:**

These songs ten, out of the thousand of Kurukur Caṭakōpaṉ,  
Whose natural bent it is to adore, ever and anon,  
The feet of Tirumāl, Who does on the radiant serpent recline,  
Aimed at the complete severence of his moorings earthly,  
Will grind to a halt the chanṭers’cycle of birth and rebirth,  
Looking on it [as it were] with red eyes [spitting deadly poison].

**Notes**

\(i\) As stated in what is known as ‘Paryaṅka Vidyā’, in the Upaniṣad, the Lord, seated on the serpent cushion, along with Mahāḻakṣmī in that glorious setting, grants audience to the ‘Muktas’ (Released Souls) on their reaching Heaven. This very setting is alluded to in the opening line of this song as in the original, in keeping with the benefit accruing to the chanters of this decad as set out in this song, namely, release from the bondage of Saṃsāra and the terrific cycle of birth and rebirth. These ten songs, by themselves, deliver the goods, looking as it were, at the worldly ties of the chanters of these songs, with red eyes, spitting poison, so as to effectively destroy these ties and put the chanters in Heaven.

\(ii\) The Āḻvār’s ultimate goal is the Lord’s pair of feet where he longs to render incessant service, rather than the heavenly bliss, as such.
