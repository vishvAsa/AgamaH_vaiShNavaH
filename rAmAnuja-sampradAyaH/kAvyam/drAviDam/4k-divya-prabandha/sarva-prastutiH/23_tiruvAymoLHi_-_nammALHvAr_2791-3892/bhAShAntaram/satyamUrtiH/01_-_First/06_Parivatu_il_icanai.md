## 00 Intro1.6
Following the pattern, hitherto noticed, of bringing to the fore a particular auspicious trait of the Lord in each decad (Tiruvāymoḻi), ‘Swārādatva’ (i.e.) easy worshippability of the Lord is emphasised in this decad. Unlike the minor deities whom it is very hard to propitiate, what with the sacrifice of goats and hens and other such harsh demands on their votaries, the Lord is pleased with whatever is offered to Him lovingly, with pious will. Being above wants of any kind, it is unthinkable that He would want from us any offering at all. God sets greater value upon the devotion of the heart than the material value of outward offerings. He hates hypocrisy and estimates the sincerity of the soul. In His song Celestial, He has affirmed: ‘Whoever offers Me in faith and love, a leaf (as Draupati [Draupadi] did), a flower (as Gajendra did), a fruit (as Sabhari did), water poured forth (as Ambariṣā did), that offering I accept, lovingly made with pious will. Things, easy of procurement for all, including the poorest of the poor, offered, not for expiation of sins or securing other ends but considering giving to Me as an end in itself and out of sheer inability to exist without making a lovegift to Me are indeed acceptable. In the absence of the devotee’s inability to offer anything for eating, I consume even the leaves and flowers offered. Vidura gave me plantain skins and Kuchela gave me but poor beaten rice and yet, I devoured them all with great avidity, like a famished fellow”.

The outward offerings may be trifles but, in God’s eye, they carry much weight, when offered in humility and devotion. Once some Princes had a desire to offer campaka flower to Lord Jagannatha at Pūri, knowing that it is His favourite flower. On going to the flower market, they found that all but a single flower had already been sold out. Each one of the Princes was keen on buying it and offered competitive price. One of them staked his entire fortune, bought the flower and offered it to the Lord. That night, God appeared in the Prince’s dream and said, “The debt of thy flower is very heavy. I cannot bear its weight”, thus showing His gracious acceptance of the sincerely made offering. As already stated, the Lord is above wants of any kind, and yet He greedily grabs at the selfless service rendered unto Him by the devotees disinterestedly, as an end in itself. In this decad, the Āḻvār enjoys and extols this great trait of the Lord.




## 1.6.1
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

பரிவது இல் ஈசனைப் பாடி விரிவது மேவல் உறுவீர்!  
பிரிவகை இன்றி நல் நீர் தூய் புரிவதுவும் புகை பூவே.

parivatu il īcaṉaip pāṭi virivatu mēval uṟuvīr!  
pirivakai iṉṟi nal nīr tūy purivatuvum pukai pūvē.

**English translation of verse 1.6.1:**

Ye zealous seekers of salvation, rise to your full stature,  
Singing the praise of our griefless God;  
Serve Him with water pure, seeking no personal good,  
Burn incense before Him and flowers do offer.

**Notes**

\(i\) This song is addressed to the seekers of salvation who should naturally rise to their full stature through complete expansion, rather, realisation of their true or essential nature.

\(ii\) Being the repository of innumerable auspicious traits, a veritable fountain of inexhaustible bliss, the Lord is naturally free from grief of any kind, on His own. But then, He grieves over the woes of His countless subjects and this trait of commisseration with the miseries of others, with a complete sense of identity and deep compassion for them, is indeed praiseworthy. Actually, this heads the list of many good qualities noticed in Śrī Rāma by the Citizens of Ayodhyā and enumerated by them in King Daśaratha’s court. Even so, the question is asked, why the Almighty Lord who can jolly well quell all our miseries in no time, should grieve for us, as we weaklings do, merely expressing our grief over the miseries of others, being incapable of giving them any kind of relief. This erroneous impression can be set at naught if we take into account our own every day experience, the parents feeling distressed over the sufferings of the young ones, notwithstanding the active steps taken by the former promptly to administer the requisite relief to the latter. Draupati, in dire distress, was no doubt prevented from getting disrobed due to the plentiful supply of clothes arranged for by Lord Kṛṣṇa, and yet, He cried out His heart, lamenting that He remained a debtor unto Draupati, having failed to be present at the scene of the dastardly occurence and worse still, having failed to avert the incident altogether. When Gajendra, the elephant raised a piteous alarm for succour at the end of a titanic struggle with its mighty opponent, the crocodile, the Lord went post-haste to the scene of distress and retrieved the elephant. All the same, the Lord very much repented that He had not rushed to Gajendrā’s aid much earlier.

\(iii\) Serving the Lord who is but our Father, should by-no-means be difficult, seeing that the son need have no qualms nor be fastidious and fretsome, in regard to the food served to his own father, by virtue of the natural bonds of Kinship and mutual concern. Discoursing on this song, Śrī Parāśara Bhaṭṭar pointed out that the text of the song bears cut that no flower is taboo, and in the name of burning incense, as part of worship, even waste wooden chips from the carpenter’s chisel could be burnt and smoke raised therefrom. There is no specification, as such, regarding the flower to be offered and the incense to be burnt. When his stalwart disciple, Nañcīyar, observed that there is a śāstraic injunction against the use of the flower, known in Samskṛit as ‘Kar ḍakārika’, for the Lord’s worship, Bhaṭṭārya elucidated that the injunction in question is solely weighted in favour of the worshipper, to eliminate the risk involved in plucking this flower from its thorny plant.




## 1.6.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மதுவார் தண் அம் துழாயான் முது வேத முதலவனுக்கு  
எதுவே? என்பணி? என்னாது அதுவே ஆள் செய்யும் ஈடே

matuvār taṇ am tuḻāyāṉ mutu vēta mutalavaṉukku  
etuvē? eṉpaṇi? eṉṉātu atuvē āḷ ceyyum īṭē

**English translation of verse 1.6.2:**

“What service is there, and that too, for poor me,  
Appropriate to the Primate, the colossal Lord, by Vedas revealed,  
Wearer of nice, cool, ‘tulacī’ garland, shedding honey?”  
If one doesn’t think so (and shrink), by him is the Lord well served indeed.

**Notes**

\(i\) Having ruled out, in the preceding song, the restriction regarding the thing to be offered to the Lord, the Āḻvār now stresses the fact that there is also no restriction regarding the persons eligible to serve Him. If one does not shrink back from the Lord’s service, in bewildering amazement that there is hardly any service that can be rendered, appropriate to the colossal stature of the Lord and, that too, by one with serious limitations, it is as good as having served the Lord. In other words, there is hardly any scope for such a feeling of aloofness.

\(ii\) Even a faded garland coming in contact with the Lord’s person will become fresh again and shed copious quantities of honey. That being so, the devotee need not have any qualms in regard to the offerings to be made.

\(iii\) As Bādarāyaṇa (*Sage Vyāsa*) has pointed out in his ‘Brahma Sūtra,’[^1] the Lord can be known only through the authority of the Vedas, as distinguished from Ocular and inferential knowledge. The Supreme Lord is revealed by the Vedas, as the first and foremost.

[^1]:  ‘Śāstra Yōnitvāt’.





## 1.6.3
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஈடும் எடுப்பும் இல் ஈசன் மாடு விடாது என் மனனே  
பாடும் என் நா அவன் பாடல் ஆடும் என் அங்கம் அணங்கே.

īṭum eṭuppum il īcaṉ māṭu viṭātu eṉ maṉaṉē  
pāṭum eṉ nā avaṉ pāṭal āṭum eṉ aṅkam aṇaṅkē.

**English translation of verse 1.6.3:**

My mind can never be away from Īcaṉ (Lord Supreme),  
Who makes no distinction ‘tween high and low;  
My tongue His glory sings at all times  
While my body danceth in ecstatic glow.

**Notes**

\(i\) The Lord does not extend special favours by reason of one’s high parentage, calibre and conduct, nor does He give up those of low descent, meagre intellect and poor conduct. He is absolutely impartial. †Prahlāda and Vibhīṣaṇa of Asura and Rākṣasa clan, respectively, were among His beneficiaries. If the other Asuras and Rākṣasas came to grief the fault was not with the Lord. It is like a few persons falling, now and then, into the tank dug up for the common good of all and killing themselves.

\(ii\) It is noteworthy that the Āḻvār stands rivetted to the Lord by word, deed and thought.




## 1.6.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அணங்கு என ஆடும் என் அங்கம் வணங்கி வழிபடும் ஈசன்  
பிணங்கி அமரர் பிதற்றும் குணங்கெழு கொள்கையினானே

aṇaṅku eṉa āṭum eṉ aṅkam vaṇaṅki vaḻipaṭum īcaṉ  
piṇaṅki amarar pitaṟṟum kuṇaṅkeḻu koḷkaiyiṉāṉē

**English translation of verse 1.6.4:**

Īcaṉ (the Lord) I venerate, dancing in gay abandon,  
Is the natural repository of many an auspicious trait,  
Leaving the celestials in the high Heaven,  
Entranced and engaged in endless debate.

**Note**

As the Lord said in Bhagavad-Gītā, His lover’s thoughts are rivetted to Him, their lives are nestled in Him and their conversation is solely about Him, full of mutual enlightenment and entertainment. The debate, referred to, in this Song, could arise from the adoration of the Lord by the Celestials, from different angles, one group talking about the Lord’s transcendent glory and the other about His easy accessibility and loving condescension. The Āḻvār marvels at that even his faculties vie with the experience of that exalted band in heaven.




## 1.6.5
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கொள்கை கொளாமை இலாதான் எள்கல் இராகம் இலாதான்  
விள்கை விள்ளாமை விரும்பி உள் கலந்தார்க்கு ஓர் அமுதே.

koḷkai koḷāmai ilātāṉ eḷkal irākam ilātāṉ  
viḷkai viḷḷāmai virumpi uḷ kalantārkku ōr amutē.

**English translation of verse 1.6.5:**

Not given to likes and dislikes, acceptance or rejection,  
Of (service from) devotees, looking to their attainments alone,  
A nectar of incomparable excellence, the Lord is  
Unto those that with Him do mingle, giving up all else.

**Note**

In the preceding song, the Āḻvār presented to us the Lord as One, who would welcome to His benevolent fold every one, without distinction of high and low, seeking His protection. And now, we are told that the Lord is free from likes and dislikes and is, therefore, not prone to extend preferential treatment to some and be indifferent to others on the basis of their individual attainments, while enlisting them in His service. All that He looks for is whether these devotees arc steadfast in their devotion, true to their essential nature of being the objects of His sole enjoyment (ananya bhōgyatva) or merely seek from Him the fulfilment of their own personal desires, the odds and ends. While the latter class seeking the lesser fruits get what they want and also get parted from the Lord in the bargain, to the former class who stand rivetted to, and nestled, in Him, He is a veritable nectar of incomparable excellence, ever fresh and insatiable.




## 1.6.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அமுதம் அமரர்கட்கு ஈந்த நிமிர் சுடர் ஆழி நெடுமால்  
அமுதிலும் ஆற்ற இனியன் நிமிர் திரை நீள் கடலானே.

amutam amararkaṭku īnta nimir cuṭar āḻi neṭumāl  
amutilum āṟṟa iṉiyaṉ nimir tirai nīḷ kaṭalāṉē.

**English translation of verse 1.6.6:**

Of limitless glory, Neṭumāl, holding the discus  
Of mounting radiance and reclining on the spacious  
Milk-Ocean of surging waves, is more appetising indeed  
Than the ambrosia which unto Amarars (Devas) He once delivered.

**Note**

The Āḻvār has nothing but contemptuous pity for the Devas who sought the ‘amṛt’ obtained by churning the Milk-Ocean, instead of the far more delicious Lord holding the effulgent discus, enchanting beyond words. Although the Āḻvār’s contempt for the Devas is not explicit from the text of the song, the episode of delivering the “amṛt” to the Devas, referred to, in the first line of the song, pales into insignificance before the Lord’s own nectarean presence and exquisite charm enjoyed by the Āḻvār in the second line of the song and thus indirectly exhibits the Devas at a disadvantage. The Āḻvār has given yet another name to the Lord, namely, ‘*One who is more appetising than ambrosia* Nampi Tiruvaḻutināṭu Tācar remarked that the Devas were no better than the bovine species, not looking up and beholding the exquisite charm of the Lord churning and moving around with His thousand sinewy shoulders and the beautiful garlands adorning them. Instead, they were gazing at the ocean, with their heads bent down, content with a mere extract from the salt-water, what a pity!




## 1.6.7
நீள் கடல் சூழ் இலங்கைக் கோன் தோள்கள் தலை துணிசெய்தான்  
தாள்கள் தலையில் வணங்கி நாள்கள் தலைக்கழிமின்னே.

nīḷ kaṭal cūḻ ilaṅkaik kōṉ tōḷkaḷ talai tuṇiceytāṉ  
tāḷkaḷ talaiyil vaṇaṅki nāḷkaḷ talaikkaḻimiṉṉē.

**English translation of verse 1.6.7:**

If you bow unto Him Who Smote  
The heads and shoulders of the King  
Of Laṅkā, with the long sea as its moat,  
The ocean of time, it helps crossing.




## 1.6.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கழிமின் தொண்டீர்கள் கழித்துத் தொழுமின் அவனை தொழுதால்  
வழி நின்ற வல்வினை மாள்வித்து அழிவின்றி ஆக்கம் தருமே.

kaḻimiṉ toṇṭīrkaḷ kaḻittut toḻumiṉ avaṉai toḻutāl  
vaḻi niṉṟa valviṉai māḷvittu aḻiviṉṟi ākkam tarumē.

**English translation of verse 1.6.8:**

Ye, servants of God, sever your contacts  
With all things ungodly and serve the Lord;  
Your age-long, sturdy sins, the Lord will cut out  
And grant you eternal bliss and beatitude.




## 1.6.9
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

தரும அரும் பயன் ஆய திருமகளார் தனிக் கேள்வன்  
பெருமை உடைய பிரானார் இருமை வினை கடிவாரே.

taruma arum payaṉ āya tirumakaḷār taṉik kēḷvaṉ  
perumai uṭaiya pirāṉār irumai viṉai kaṭivārē.

**English translation of verse 1.6.9:**

The bliss very dear, Tirumakaḷ’s unique Spouse confers,  
The Benefactor great (in her gloricus company) full of grace,  
The fruits of actions, good and bad, He severs,  
(The impediments to the free flow of His grace).

**Notes**

\(i\) Tirumakaḷ, (Goddess Mahālakṣmī) is the very embodiment of grace.[^1] Her perpetual presence by the side of the Lord is intended to prepare the ground for the supplication by the individual souls, at all times, without any restriction whatsoever. Although the Lord is the ultimate giver and deliverer, yet He invariably acts only when Mahālakṣmī plays the recommendatory role, mediating and pleading for erring souls.

[^1]:  ‘lakṣmyā saha hṛśīkeśo devyā kāruṇya rūpayā’ (Śrī Pāñcarātra.)

\(ii\) For the attainment of final bliss, both merit (Puṇya) and demerit (Pāpa or Sins) are impediments. As Śrī Vedānta Deśika has put it, in his ‘Varadarāja pañcāsat’, the former is a golden fetter while the latter is tin iron fetter. A golden fetter is still a fetter and thus both ‘Puṇya’ and ‘Pāpa’ impede one’s advancement to the final goal. Hence the need to cut out both, an act of grace galore, on the part of Lakṣmī-Kānta (the gracious Consort of Goddess Mahālakṣmī).





## 1.6.10
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கடிவார் தீய வினைகள் நொடியாரும் அளவைக்கண்  
கொடியா அடு புள் உயர்த்த வடிவு ஆர் மாதவனாரே.

kaṭivār tīya viṉaikaḷ noṭiyārum aḷavaikkaṇ  
koṭiyā aṭu puḷ uyartta vaṭivu ār mātavaṉārē.

**English translation of verse 1.6.10:**

Mātavaṉ, of exquisite Form,  
On whose banner is Garuḍa the bird,  
Destroyer of enemies, will, in no time,  
Root out the fell sins (we dread).

**Note**

What is emphasised here is the utmost speed with which Mādhava, the Lord, in conjunction with the Divine Mother, roots out all the evils in us. And what more? The Lord extends to the Soul, reclaimed just then, the same affinity as He holds for the pre-eminent Garuḍa, the ‘Ever-free angel—Nitya Sūri’. The reclamation is put through in a trice through the instrumentality of Śrī Mahālakṣmī, who urges: “My Lord, here is the supplicant at your door-step, tossed between birth on one side, and death on the other, and smitten, in between, by maladies, both mental and physical; please bestow your grace and redeem him, turning a blind eye to all his sins; else, you may have to write off the entire ‘*Līlā Vibhūti*’ (Sportive universe)”,




## 1.6.11
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மாதவன்பால் சடகோபன் தீது அவம் இன்றி உரைத்த  
ஏதம் இல் ஆயிரத்து இப் பத்து ஓத வல்லார் பிறவாரே.

mātavaṉpāl caṭakōpaṉ tītu avam iṉṟi uraitta  
ētam il āyirattu ip pattu ōta vallār piṟavārē.

**English translation of verse 1.6.11:**

Those initiated in these songs ten,  
Out of the thousand flawless songs of Caṭakōpaṉ,  
Adoring Mātavaṉ as One above the twin faults  
(Of aloofness and abandonment), will from rebirth be freed for ever.

**Note**

It might be apprehended that the Lord is open to the twin faults of (1) Keeping Himself aloof from us with an air of indifference because of His exaltation, and (2) abandoning us, looking to our truck-loads of vices. The Āḻvār avers, in this decad, that the Lord is above these faults, thereby emphasising His easy worshippability.
