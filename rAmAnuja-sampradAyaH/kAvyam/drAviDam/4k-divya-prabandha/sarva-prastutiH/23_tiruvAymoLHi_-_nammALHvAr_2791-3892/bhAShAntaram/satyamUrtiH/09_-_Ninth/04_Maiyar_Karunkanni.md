## 00 Intro9.4
The ‘Śāstras’ (Scriptural texts) proclaim, on the one hand, that the Supreme Lord is One of unbridled independence, and on the other, depict Him as an embodiment of innumerable auspicious traits. The latter get submerged when the former holds sway. But when the Lord’s independence gets subdued through the irresistible spell cast by Mahā Lakṣmī’s personal magnetism and the persuasive eloquence of Her pleadings, the auspicious qualities denoted by His name, ‘Nārāyaṉa’, become pronounced. These are: Tender solicitude (Vātsalya), Sovereignty (Svāmitva), Loving condescension (Sauśīlya), Easy accessibility (Saulabhya), knowledge (Jñāna) and Power or Energy (Śakti). Fully aware that the Lord does possess, *inter alia*, the trait of loving condescension and that the Divine Mother is the fountain source of inspiration for the influx of this grand trait, the Āḻvār naturally grieved, all the more, over his erstwhile plight of separation from the Lord, despite his inordinate longing for incessant communion with Him. The Āḻvār pined for the on-coming of the Lord, in the manner He rushed to the rescue of Gajendra, the pious elephant in dire distress and sprang forth from the pillar to shed His unique grace on Prahlādha, the young devotee. The Lord, on His part, was keen to maintain His reputation as the Repository of all auspicious qualities and presented Himself to the Āḻvār; if He did not respond to the Āḻvār’s call even now, despite His deep yearning, all that is claimed for Him by the Scriptures would be of no more than academic value, mere words, high-sounding like the roaring of the sea. Overjoyed by the Lord’s presence (mental vision), the Āḻvār ends up this decad by giving vent ro his gratitude for the Lord having pressed him into service and got these hymns, sung by him, for the edification of the pious. “What a bliss and that too, bestowed on a single individual!” is how the Āḻvār revolves in his mind.




## 9.4.1
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மையார்கருங்கண்ணி கமல மலர்மேல்  
செய்யாள் திருமார்வினில்சேர் திருமாலே  
வெய்யார்சுடர்ஆழி சுரிசங்கம்ஏந்தும்  
கையா உன்னைக்காணக் கருதும் என்கண்ணே. (2)

maiyārkaruṅkaṇṇi kamala malarmēl  
ceyyāḷ tirumārviṉilcēr tirumālē  
veyyārcuṭarāḻi curicaṅkamēntum  
kaiyā uṉṉaikkāṇak karutum eṉkaṇṇē. (2)

**English translation of verse 9.4.1:**

Oh, Lord holding the Conch lovely and the dazzling discus hot.  
Long do my eyes to behold You; on Your winsome chest,  
You bear, oh, Tirumāl, (Lakṣmī) the lotus-born of complexion red,  
Whose dark eyes are with collyrium neatly dressed.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The Āḻvār longs to behold the grand assembly of the Divine Mother of exquisite charm and the powerful conch and discus on the Lord’s person, the former on His broad chest and the latter in His lovely hands.

\(ii\) *The Divine Consort with coḻlyrium-dressed eyes*:

It is imperative that Mahā Lakṣmī, the eternal Spouse of the Supreme Lord, the great intercessor between man and God, should always be in Conjunction with the Lord. The Divine Mother’s presence, beside the Lord, is necessary when the subject submits to His protection, so as to make him shed all fear of punishment at the hands of the strict and unrelenting judge and secure His succour, sure and certain, through the Mother’s recommendatory role. If, in the exercise of unbridled independence, the Lord, however, turned a deaf ear to the Mother’s entreaty, the beloved Spouse that she is, she unleashes her irresistible physical charms and casts a bewitching spell on Him; enthralled by her ravishing beauty, He then carries out her dictates, in full. Again, after the subject’s admission to the Lord’s sweet fold, the Mother’s presence is essential, so as to enable the subject to render the coveted service unto the Divine Couple. The enthralling charm of the Mother’s eyes being thus the main source of his sustenance, the Āḻvār naturally dwells on the beauty of Her eyes, right at the beginning of this song (as in the original text). The Mother’s dark eyes have a natural, built-in grace of their own and hardly need any make-up, by way of dressing them with collyrium, which is but an auspicious formality, gone through, as a matter-of-course.

\(iii\) *Lakṣmī, the lotus-born of red complexion*: Emerging from the red lotus, the Divine Mother acquires its colour as well—“Padme sthitām padma varṇām”, as the Śrī-Sūkta says. The lotus-born Lakṣmī found even the lotus petals, known for their softness, a little too hard for her tender feet and chose to get herself lodged on the Lord’s winsome chest. It is indeed a case of mutual attraction, the Lord succumbing to the Mother’s charms and the latter, in turn, getting intoxicated by the Lord’s exquisite Form. As Nampiḷḷai would put it, the Mother feels drawn to the lovely conch and discus, gracefully held by the Lord, in His hands, even as the Lord is attracted by the lotus flower held by the Mother.

\(iv\) Instead of saying straightaway that he pines for the Lord’s presence in sweet conjunction with the Divine Mother and the lovely weapons, the Āḻvār says that his eyes long to behold Him. This is like the hungry beggar pleading for the appeasement of his child’s hunger first.




## 9.4.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கண்ணேஉன்னைக் காணக்கருதி என்நெஞ்சம்  
எண்ணேகொண்ட சிந்தையதாய் நின்றுஇயம்பும்  
விண்ணோர் முனிவர்க்கு என்றும் காண்புஅரியாயை  
நண்ணாது ஒழியேன் என்று நான் அழைப்பனே

kaṇṇēuṉṉaik kāṇakkaruti eṉneñcam  
eṇṇēkoṇṭa cintaiyatāy niṉṟuiyampum  
viṇṇōr muṉivarkku eṉṟum kāṇpuariyāyai  
naṇṇātu oḻiyēṉ eṉṟu nāṉ aḻaippaṉē

**English translation of verse 9.4.2:**

Many a thought thinks my revolving mind,  
Eager to behold You, virtually my pair of eyes;  
I beckon You, even celestials and sages can’t visualise,  
For, to attain You, I am fully deteimined.

**Notes:**

\(i\) Having pointed out the longing of his eyes in the preceding song the Āḻvār now recounts the manner in which he and his mind yearn to get at the Lord. The Lord has been described as the Āḻvār’s pair of eyes. This follows the Vedic text, “Cakṣucca dhraṣṭavyañca Nārāyaṇaḥ”, declaring the Lord as the eyes; even as the eyes help us to see all things around, the Lord helps us to behold Him without whose loving grace, none can have so much as a glimpse of Him. When the Āḻvār says that his mind longs to look at the Lord, it only means that his eyes, confederate with his mind, long to see Him. The eyes, by themselves, cannot see a thing, even though they may be wide open, when the mind is pre-occupied with something else; hence, the necessity of the mind’s active conjunction with the eyes. In the case of the worldlings (Samsārīs), the mind and the eyes will be steeped in sensual pleasures. But here is the Āḻvār whose mind and eyes stand rivetted to the Lord, in the manner Lord Kṛṣṇa set out in His Song Celestial, “Yasyāṃ jāgrati bhūtāni Sā niśā paśyato muneḥ” (Gītā II.69).

\(ii\) The many thoughts pondered over by the Āḻvār’s mind are but the different ways or facets of God-enjoyment, as set out by Saint Rāmānuja in ‘Śrī Vaikuṇṭha Gadya”, in the string of Ślokas from ‘Kadhā ahaṃ’, up to ‘āsām vartayitvā’. The Alvar’s mind cries out and thus discharges the function of the tongue as well.

\(iii\) True it is, that the Lord is not easily attainable even by Brahmā and other Celestials and sages of the eminence of Sanaka, Sanandana etc. And yet, the Āḻvār is intent upon gaining access to the Lord, who could certainly break all precedents and get within the Āḻvār’s reach, even as He had dowered on him, out of His spontaneous grace, perfect knowledge, shorn of doubt, despair, discrepancies and deviations.




## 9.4.3
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அழைக்கின்ற அடிநாயேன் நாய்கூழை வாலால்  
குழைக்கின்றது போல என்உள்ளம் குழையும்  
மழைக்கு அன்றுகுன்றம் எடுத்து ஆநிரைகாத்தாய்.  
பிழைக்கின்றதுஅருள்என்று பேதுறுவனே

aḻaikkiṉṟa aṭināyēṉ nāykūḻai vālāl  
kuḻaikkiṉṟatu pōla eṉuḷḷam kuḻaiyum  
maḻaikku aṉṟukuṉṟam eṭuttu āniraikāttāy.  
piḻaikkiṉṟatuaruḷeṉṟu pētuṟuvaṉē

**English translation of verse 9.4.3:**

The mind of this base fellow, lying low and calling You out.  
Whirls like unto the dog eagerly twisting its tail short;  
You held once, oh Lord. Mount (Govardhan) aloft  
And spared the cattle, the fury of the rains;  
Me Your grace evades and this my mind does pain.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The Āḻvār feels agitated why the Lord, who sheds His grace on all yearning votaries, should withhold it from him alone, in spite of his inordinate longing for incessant communion with Him.

\(ii\) The Āḻvār submits that he is fully aware of his humble stature and yet, devoured by inordinate God-love, he keeps calling Him, like unto a dog trying hard to express its feelings to its master by twisting its tail. Pity unto the dog, with a short tail, which cannot function in this regard as effectively as a tail of better length! The Āḻvār feels that he too is in the same predicament as the dog with a dwarf tail, unable to express adequately his pangs of separation from the Lord. To a question, supposed to have been put to him by the Lord, as to why he aspires for Him without the requisite means and equipment, the Āḻvār rejoins that He has to shed on him His redemptive grace, in the same way as He shielded the cattle and shepherds from the terrific rains, unleashed by Indra, by holding aloft Mount Govardhan.




## 9.4.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

உறுவது இதுஎன்று உனக்கு ஆள்பட்டு நின்கண்  
பெறுவது எதுகொல்என்று பேதையேன் நெஞ்சம்  
மறுகல்செய்யும் வானவர் தானவர்க்கு என்றும்  
அறிவதுஅரிய அரியாய அம்மானே!

uṟuvatu itueṉṟu uṉakku āḷpaṭṭu niṉkaṇ  
peṟuvatu etukoleṉṟu pētaiyēṉ neñcam  
maṟukalceyyum vāṉavar tāṉavarkku eṉṟum  
aṟivatuariya ariyāya ammāṉē!

**English translation of verse 9.4.4:**

Oh, Lord Ari, none can ever aver what you are,  
This vassal knows not what for him is in store,  
Whether he will attain and serve You for ever  
Or be caught in the vortex of worldly life,  
My ignorant mind is indeed in a state of strife.

**Notes:**

\(i\) When one submits to the Lord’s protection, true to one’s essential nature of exclusive dependence on the Lord one has indeed to resign oneself to His good grace and benign will, without casting doubts of any kind on His dispensation. It should indeed be left to the Lord’s sweet will and discretion to deal with us in any manner He deems fit and feasible. And yet, the Āḻvār feels agitated whether the Lord would at all be pleased to bless him with eternal service unto Him in close proximity or still keep him on, in the bondage of ‘Saṃsāra’. The Āḻvār’s misery is all the more poignant, he being right in the vanguard of ‘Prapannas’, whose firm conviction it is, that the Lord is their Sole Sustainer on whom they are totally dependent. It is the exuberance of God-love, which induces such frightful misgivings in the Āḻvār, despite his firm faith in the Lord and his awareness of this *prima facie* contradiction, between conviction and conduct, only goes to augment his misery.

\(ii\) When questioned by the Lord as to why he allowed himself to be haunted by such fears, the Āḻvār observes that neither he Devas nor the Asuras could comprehend His true nature and manner of dispensation and it was just possible that the Lord had put bin also on the same footing.




## 9.4.5
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அரியாய அம்மானை அமரர் பிரானை  
பெரியானை பிரமனை முன்படைத்தானை  
வரிவாள் அரவின்அணைப் பள்ளிகொள்கின்ற  
கரியான்கழல் காணக் கருதும் கருத்தே.

ariyāya ammāṉai amarar pirāṉai  
periyāṉai piramaṉai muṉpaṭaittāṉai  
varivāḷ araviṉaṇaip paḷḷikoḷkiṉṟa  
kariyāṉkaḻal kāṇak karutum karuttē.

**English translation of verse 9.4.5:**

Long do I, in my thoughts, to behold the feet of the dark-hued Lord,  
Who does on the somnolent serpent-bed lovely repose, the benevolent Overlord  
Of the Celestials, the Lord Supreme, the Sire great,  
Who does His devotees’ opponents quell, Who did create  
Piramaṉ (Brahmā, the four-headed), first and foremost.

**Notes:**

That the Lord is most easily accessible to the devout and much beyond the reach of others has been highlighted by the Āḻvār himself, in I-3. This has now been pointed out to the Āḻvār by the Lord, who confesses to His easy-accessibility and enquires of the Āḻvār what precisely he wanted from Him. The Āḻvār wants nothing more than beholding the Lord’s lovely pair of feet, against the exquisite background of His serpent-bed and his enticing Form, like unto a dark emerald in sweet repose.




## 9.4.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கருத்தே உன்னைக் காணக்கருதி என்நெஞ்சத்து  
இருத்தாக இருத்தினேன் தேவர்கட்குஎல்லாம்  
விருத்தா விளங்கும் சுடர்ச்சோதி உயரத்து  
ஒருத்தா உன்னைஉள்ளும் என்உள்ளம் உகந்தே

karuttē uṉṉaik kāṇakkaruti eṉneñcattu  
iruttāka iruttiṉēṉ tēvarkaṭkuellām  
viruttā viḷaṅkum cuṭarccōti uyarattu  
oruttā uṉṉaiuḷḷum eṉuḷḷam ukantē

**English translation of verse 9.4.6:**

You are my very thought, oh, Lord, to behold You, I am determined  
And so, You I have planted firmly in my mind;  
Up above the Celestials You do soar, you remain  
With splendour unique, high up in the effulgent Heaven  
Ever do my thoughts in You abide, in sweet contemplation.

**Notes:**

The Lord having entered the Āḻvār’s mind, in response to his entreaties in the five preceding songs, the Āḻvār now says that he has, for ever, impounded in his mind the Lord who is higher than the highest. He looks upon the Lord as his very thought sticking fast unto Him.




## 9.4.7
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

உகந்தேஉன்னை உள்ளும் என்உள்ளத்து அகம்பால்  
அகம்தான் அமர்ந்தே இடம்கொண்ட அமலா  
மிகும்தானவன் மார்வுஅகலம் இருகூறா  
நகந்தாய் நரசிங்கம்அதுஆய உருவே!

ukantēuṉṉai uḷḷum eṉuḷḷattu akampāl  
akamtāṉ amarntē iṭamkoṇṭa amalā  
mikumtāṉavaṉ mārvuakalam irukūṟā  
nakantāy naraciṅkamatuāya uruvē!

**English translation of verse 9.4.7:**

Oh, immaculate Lord, In me seated firm, You remain,  
Your potent nails tore the haughty demon’s broad chest in twain,  
Oh, Naraciṅka, revels indeed the inner core of my heart  
In the enjoyment of You, my Lord, so sweet.

**Notes:**

The Āḻvār feels gratified that the Lord has responded to his call even as He did, in the case of Prahlādā to cater to whose ardent wish, He emerged as Man-Lion, right from inside a pillar and cleaved the haughty Hiraṇya’s body into parts. In his present state of exultation, the Āḻvār drowns all his past miseries due to separation from the Lord, nor is he apprehensive of the dreadful prospect of yet another spell of separation from Him. The present enjoyment is so full and complete that it does not admit of brooding over the past desolation or dreading a gloomy future.




## 9.4.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

உருவாகிய ஆறுசமயங்கட்குஎல்லாம்  
பொருவாகி நின்றான் அவன் எல்லாப்பொருட்கும்  
அருவாகிய ஆதியை தேவர்கட்குஎல்லாம்  
கருவாகிய கண்ணனை கண்டுகொண்டேனே.

uruvākiya āṟucamayaṅkaṭkuellām  
poruvāki niṉṟāṉ avaṉ ellāpporuṭkum  
aruvākiya ātiyai tēvarkaṭkuellām  
karuvākiya kaṇṇaṉai kaṇṭukoṇṭēṉē.

**English translation of verse 9.4.8:**

Perceive and enjoy do I Kaṇṇaṉ, the Primate,  
The sole Sustainer of all lives, the Progenitor great,  
Of the Devas, well beyond the mischief of the heresies  
Of the six alien systems of philosophy.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The omnipotent Lord can surely preserve Himself from the onslaught of the heretical doctrines like those of Cārvākas, Jains, Buddhists, Vaiśeṣikas, Śāṅkhyas and Pāśupadhas, denying His very existence. These systems do not admit the authority of the Vedas.

\(ii\) The Lord is the great Ordainer, being the first Cause of all things and the sole Sustainer of all souls, as their Internal Controller, residing in all things and beings.

\(iii\) The love-intoxicated Āḻvār could envisage Lord Kṛṣṇa, a by-gone Avatāra, as if he was a contemporary of His. The impious like Śiśupāla could not, however, perceive the Lord in His true Form, even though the Lord, in His incarnate Form, was in their midst.




## 9.4.9
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கண்டுகொண்டு என்கண்இணை ஆரக்களித்து  
பண்டைவினையாயின பற்றோடுஅறுத்து  
தொண்டர்க்கு அமுதுஉண்ணச் சொல்மாலைகள் சொன்னேன்  
அண்டத்துஅமரர் பெருமான்! அடியேனே.

kaṇṭukoṇṭu eṉkaṇiṇai ārakkaḷittu  
paṇṭaiviṉaiyāyiṉa paṟṟōṭuaṟuttu  
toṇṭarkku amutuuṇṇac colmālaikaḷ coṉṉēṉ  
aṇṭattuamarar perumāṉ! aṭiyēṉē.

**English translation of verse 9.4.9:**

Lustily do my eyes feast on the Form exquisite,  
Of the Chief of the Celestials in Heaven, who did eradicate  
My age-long ills and evils and made me His vassal;  
Blessed am I to feed the devout with this nectarean hymnal.

**Notes:**

Not stopping with enjoying the Lord himself, the Āḻvār extends the delight to others around and to posterity through generations. Indeed, this confers on him a greater joy than that resulting from the severance of his age-long sins and the glorious vision of the Lord. Many indeed are the poets of this world but none has declared the intention in composing the poems, in the manner the Āḻvār has done, in this song. Tiruvāymoḻi has been graciously composed by the Saint in order to nourish the Lord’s devotees with the nectarean sweetness of its contents. The opening word “Bhaktāmṛtam”, the ambrosia for God-lovers, in the opening invocatory śloka, composed by Śrīman Nāthamuni, is derived from this song, based on the Āḻvār’s intention, as set out, in this song.




## 9.4.10
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அடியான் இவன்என்று எனக்குஆர்அருள்செய்யும்  
நெடியானை நிறைபுகழ் அம்சிறைப் புள்ளின்  
கொடியானை குன்றாமல் உலகம்அளந்த  
அடியானை அடைந்து அடியேன் உய்ந்தவாறே

aṭiyāṉ ivaṉeṉṟu eṉakkuāraruḷceyyum  
neṭiyāṉai niṟaipukaḻ amciṟaip puḷḷiṉ  
koṭiyāṉai kuṉṟāmal ulakamaḷanta  
aṭiyāṉai aṭaintu aṭiyēṉ uyntavāṟē

**English translation of verse 9.4.10:**

Oh, what a bliss this vassal has attained!  
The Lord, who the worlds, with no exception, spanned.  
On Whose banner is the bird, of large fame and lovely plumes,  
Has lavished on me, as His vassal dear, His grace supreme.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The Āḻvār proclaims with great joy that the Lord has lavished on him His grace galore, looking upon him as His vassal. Here is a suggestion that, although he is not a true servant as such of the Lord, He has deigned to look upon him as one and, on that score, lavished all His affections on him. Delving into the inner core of the meaning yielded by the original text of this song, Nampiḷḷai would say, the Lord’s bounty, which is commensurate with His own greatness, is for His own delectation and does not, in the least, depend upon the stature of the recipient, high or low. Did not the Lord set His lovely pair of feet on one and all, without distinction of high or low, unasked and unsolicited, during His advent as Tṛvikrama?

\(ii\) It is noteworthy, in this context, that the subject fares better as the Lord's servant (vassal) than as His child. Whereas children inherit but a portion of the father’s property, the servants become the sole objects of the master’s strong affections. Further, the former is but a material gain whereas the latter is spiritual in its content. When Piḷḷai Akalaṅka Brahma Rāyar, the disciple of Kūrattāḷvāṉ, offended, unwittingly though, Parāśara Bhaṭṭar, the Guru’s son, the latter left Śrīraṅgam for Tirukkōṭṭiyūr. Rāyar naturally felt uneasy over this turn of events; in his great anxiety for conciliation with Bhaṭṭārya, Rāyar sought the good offices of one ‘Irukai mata vāraṇaṉ’, an intimate servant of Bhaṭṭārya, for mediation and despatched him to Tirukkōṭṭiyūr on a peace-mission. With his coaxing eloquence and personal magnetism, the servant, a mere weaver, by caste, so very dear to Lord Raṅganātha and Bhaṭṭārya alike, brought about the change of heart in Bhaṭṭārya who deigned to forgive Rāyar. When observers exḷaimed that it is only an exemplary servant, who could accomplish such a difficult task, Bhaṭṭārya responded, saying that Vāraṇaṉ was, by his very nature, a born-servant, who could conquer all. So great is the efficacy of service and it is little wonder then that the Lord values it most and lavishes His affections on the devout servants.




## 9.4.11
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஆறாமதயானை அடர்த்தவன்தன்னை  
சேறுஆர்வயல் தென்குருகூர்ச் சடகோபன்  
நூறேசொன்ன ஓர்ஆயிரத்துள் இப்பத்தும்  
ஏறேதரும் வானவர்தம் இன்உயிர்க்கே (2)

āṟāmatayāṉai aṭarttavaṉtaṉṉai  
cēṟuārvayal teṉkurukūrc caṭakōpaṉ  
nūṟēcoṉṉa ōrāyirattuḷ ippattum  
ēṟētarum vāṉavartam iṉuyirkkē (2)

**English translation of verse 9.4.11:**

These songs ten, out of the ten hundreds, sung by Caṭakōpaṉ,  
Of Kurukūr with fields fertile, adoring the great one,  
Who the elephant in perpetual must had slain,  
Will lead the chanters, on to the Lord Supreme,  
The chief of the Celestials, unto them very sweet.

**Notes:**

\(i\) This decad is said to have the power to put the chanters on to the Supreme Lord, the beloved Chief of the ‘Nityas’ (Eternal Heroes in Heaven).

\(ii\) Even as the Lord slew the elephant in interminable must, He will destroy our sins of appalling magnitude.

\(iii\) The fields of Kurukūr provide its inhabitants with copious food while the Āḻvār, the great ṛavant of the place, feeds sumptuously, the ‘Mumukṣus’, the seekers of salvation, all over.

\(iv\) Even as every decad brings into focus a central topic or theme, every Centum stresses a particular aspect of God-head. See aphorism 215 of ‘Ācārya Hṛdayam’.
