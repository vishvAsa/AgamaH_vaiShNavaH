## 00 Intro9.9
Our great preceptors used to call this decad, as the ‘Evening brawl’ and the third decad in the next (tenth) centum, as the ‘Morning squabble’. In the latter decad, the Āḻvār enters the vein of the Gopis, the damsels of Virundāvaṉ, who quarrelled with Kṛṣṇa early in the morning when he was about to take the cattle to the pastures for grazing, dissuading him from going to the outlying fields, in view of their inability to brook separation from him for a whole day, not to speak of the lurking danger from Kaṃsa’s spies and evil agents. In this decad. the Āḻvār experiences the pangs of separation, undergone by the Gopīs during those evenings, when Kṛṣṇa was a little late in returning home after tending the grazing cattle, by day. On certain evenings, Kṛṣṇa would return at the head of the cattle, sounding the bugle, while, on other days. He would allow the cattle to go ahead and walk behind them. Well, during those evenings, when Kṛṣṇa did not make His appearance first but chose to walk behind the cattle, even that little prolongation of Kṛṣṇa’s absence upset the Gopīs who suffered the anguish of an age. The Āḻvār is found in this decad. experiencing, singly, the pangs experienced by all of them in the above context.

It is evening when the cool southerly breeze wafts the sweet fragrance of the Jasmine, in full bloom and the lovely Moon is up in the Sky. Then there is the roaring of the sea, the tuneful cooing of the warbling birds, the distant sound of the bugle and a host of other things which make that part of the day highly delectable. But all these normal instruments of happiness affect the frustrated Āḻvār adversely, as he could not gain access to Tirunāvāy, much as he longed for. All these remind him of the Lord, making his separation from Him, all the more poignant. A striking parallel to this can be found in Sītā during her captivity in Laṅkā, surrounded by an uncouth band of Rākṣasīs, tormenting and torturing her. What was it she had longed for while following Lord Rāma into exile and what was it she got herself landed in? Well, She thought that she could have her Lord all unto herself, without the distractions of the Palace where he would have had to divide his time among so many parents, subjects, ministers and so on. But she found herself in the gruesome predicament of a captive on whom miseries of aḷl kinds were unleashed by those unrelenting monsters, set upon her by Rāvaṇa, their king. She was even driven to the very edge of the extreme step of strangling herself with her long locks of hair.

Nampi Tiruvaraṅka Nārāyaṇa Tācar, a disciple of Nampiḷḷai attended the latter‘s discourses of Tiruvāymoḻi. One day, Tācar happened to meet Peṟṟi, a disciple of Nañcīyar, the preceptor of Nampiḻḷai. Asked about the particular decad. currently discoursed upon delightfully by Nampiḷḷai, Tācar told Peṟṟi, “Today, the learned lecturer completed the decad commencing with the words ‘Arukkum viṉai’ (9-8); tomorrow we shall listen to the discourse on the next decad, known as the evening brawl.”

When Emperumāṉār (Śrī Rāmānuja) was studying this decad under Tirumālai Āṇṭāṉ, the latter said, Āḷavantār used to say that the Āḻvār suffered as much as all the cowherdesses of Virundāvan did suffer in one night, due to Lord Kṛṣṇa’s desertion of them”, “No”, interrupted Emperumāṉār, “Sire, please say that he suffered all those pangs in the space of an evening, as a whole night is too long a period to keep him alive despite the pangs of separation from the Lord”. Indeed, a moment’s absence from God is an age of pangs to the love-lorn Saints; time seems stretched into an eternity and, during such moments, the very objects which cater to one’s pleasures seem to be the instruments of torture, wantonly designed to aggravate their sufferings.

**English translation of verse 9.9.1:**

Alas! the jasmine scent, the southerly breeze does waft,  
Cuts me across like the unrelenting shaft;  
Ha! the tuneful singing of the birds does my ears pierce,  
The evening Sun just sends me into a trance  
While the pretty clouds, by the crimson sky lit, hack me to pieces;  
Pity, I know not where I can resort  
And survive the lingering memory of my Lord  
Who did my breasts and shoulders in tight embrace hold.  
The shepherd Chief, like unto a lion, with blooming lotus eyes.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The Āḻvār gets into the vein of a Gopī whose pangs of separation from Kṛṣṇa, particularly in view of his delayed home-coming, were aggravated by the cool evening breeze, the setting Sun, crescent sky etc., individually and collectively. What is normally soothing and pleasurable acquires a different complexion altogether and turns out to be a veritable instrument of torture to the lover in a state of desolation. There are quite a few Ślokas in the first Sarga of Kiṣkindhā Kāṇḍa (Rāmāyaṇa), pitched in the same key as this decad.

\(ii\) The approach of night-fall only heightens the gloom, as even that little distraction of mind afforded by the sight of things around, by day, is no longer possible when one is locked up in darkness. The crescent sky and the clouds, seen in that setting, vividly remind the Nāyakī of the exquisite form of the Lord, limb by limb; what then are the chances of her survival through forgetting her erstwhile union with Him?




## 9.9.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

புகலிடம் அறிகிலம் தமியம்ஆலோ! புலம்புறு மணிதென்றல் ஆம்பலாலோ  
பகலடுமாலைவண் சாந்தமாலோ! பஞ்சமம் முல்லைதண் வாடையாலோ

**English translation of verse 9.9.2:**

Alas! where is the place ḷ can, in seclusion, live?  
The tinkling of the cattle bells, the sounding of the bugle  
And the southerly breeze, that unto me blows, are oppressive;  
The evening that marks the end of day, the sweet sandal,  
The cooing of the birds, the jasmine scent and the cool breeze,  
I can hardly tell how all these do my life squeeze;  
How can I my life preserve when the wondrous cowherd turns not,  
The Benefactor great, Who the worlds did ordain, ate and spat,  
Deadly unto the fell Asuras on the battle-front?

**Notes:**

Well, all those things that regaled the Nāyakī when in the company of her Lord, now oppress her. The Lord, who extends protection to His subjects, in ever so many ways, having withdrawn Himself from Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī, she hardly knows how she can at all hold her life.




## 9.9.3
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

இனிஇருந்து என்உயிர் காக்குமாறென் இணைமுலை நமுக நுண்இடை நுடங்க

paṉiirumkuḻalkaḷum nāṉku tōḷum pāviyēṉ maṉattē niṉṟuīrumālō!

**English translation of verse 9.9.3:**

Is there at all any means for me to hold my life on?  
My wondrous Lord Kaṇṇaṉ, the peerless cub, the thief, has gone,  
Having with me mingled so well, in great grief did He land  
Me with sagging breasts and waist overworked; this sinner’s mind  
Is haunted, alas! by His lotus eyes and coral lips,  
Lovely locks, long and cool and shoulders four.

**Notes:**

Apart from the physical objects around, such as the southerly breeze, fragrance of flowers etc., tormenting the Nāyakī, the Lord’s exquisite Form also comes to her mind’s eye, limb by limb, and oppresses her. Should He, who now keeps aloof, unmindful of her, have at all come and mingled with her and that too. in the manner He did? Poor Nāyakī, she cannot endure her separation from Him, through forgetting Him, because of His inseparable charm, haunting her mental vision all the time.




## 9.9.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

பாவியேன் மனத்தே நின்றுஈருமாலோ! வாடை தண்வாடை வெவ்வாயாலோ  
மேவுதண்மதியம் வெம்மதியமாலோ! மென்மலர்ப்பள்ளி வெம்பள்ளியாலோ

tūviam puḷuṭait teyva vaṇṭututainta empeṇmaiam pūitutālō  
āviyiṉ paramalla vakaikaḷālō! yāmuṭai neñcamum tuṇaiaṉṟuālō!

**English translation of verse 9.9.4:**

Alas! the Lord’s lingering Form does my mind haunt and split.  
Ha! the cool southerly breeze does fire on me spit.  
The gentle rays of the lovable Moon do heat emit,  
What! the flower bed, soft and somnolent, has turned hot!  
The flower of my feminity has been sucked and sapped  
By the Divine Bee, the Lord Supreme Who is equipped  
With Garuḍa, the hefty bird with plumes large as His vehicle,  
Indeed, all these are hard to endure for my poor soul,  
My mind too, my companion of yore, is now of no avail.

**Notes:**

It would be hardly appropriate for an young lady to give vent to expressions of this kind, openly complaining of her amorous lot. But then, the Nāyakī does not mince matters; she makes no secret of the fact that her feminity is no longer *intact*, having been thrown out of gear by her erstwhile union with the Lord. The Divine bee (Lord) has sucked the flower of her feminity and sapped it. Even the other alternative to external perception, namely, mental comprehension and rapport is not possible, the mind having also become defunct.




## 9.9.5
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

யாமுடை நெஞ்சமும் துணைஅன்றுஆலோ! ஆ புகுமாலையும் ஆகின்றுஆலோ,  
யாமுடை ஆயன்தன் மனம் கல்ஆலோ! அவனுடைத் தீம்குழல் ஈரும்ஆலோ  
யாமுடைத் துணைஎன்னும் தோழிமாரும் எம்மில் முன்அவனுக்கு மாய்வர்ஆலோ

yāmuṭai āruyir kākkumāṟueṉ? avaṉuṭai aruḷ peṟumpōtu aritē.

**English translation of verse 9.9.5:**

Alas! my mind is unto me of no avail,  
‘Tis evening and the cows are due back home;  
Should Gopāl’s enchanting flute tempt my heart and steal  
While His heart turns into a veritable stone?  
Pity! ere me, my mates are in distress great  
Weighed down by my sorry state;  
How can I preserve my life dear  
When His grace unto me is so dear?

**Notes:**

\(i\) If, as the Nāyakī puts it, her beloved Lord has become stonyhearted, she could as well take due note of it and give up pining for Him. But she couldn’t, having been attracted by the sweet strains from His magic flute, conveying, as it were, His pleadings. As Nampiḷḷai would have it, Kṛṣṇa, the Divine shepherd was trotting out excuses, such as, “I am sorry, I had to go after the cattle and even so. I am late in coming home; pity, 1 have been unavoidably detained and so on”. All these were conveyed by Him through the flute, which naturally put the Nāyakī back into the picture.

\(ii\) The Nāyakī’s frightful loneliness, making her despair of her survival, is vividly brought out in this song; her mind is of no avail and she lacks the soothing company of her mates who have broken down already, unable to witness her dire distress.




## 9.9.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அவனுடைஅருள் பெறும்போது அரிதால் அவ்அருள்அல்லன அருளும் அல்ல  
அவன்அருள் பெறுமளவு ஆவிநில்லாது அடுபகல் மாலையும் நெஞ்சும் காணேன்  
சிவனொடு பிரமன் வண் திருமடந்தை சேர்திருஆகம் எம்ஆவிஈரும்  
எவன் இனிப்புகும்இடம்? எவன் செய்கேனோ? ஆருக்குஎன் சொல்லுகேன் அன்னைமீர்காள்!

avaṉuṭaiaruḷ peṟumpōtu aritāl avaruḷallaṉa aruḷum alla  
avaṉaruḷ peṟumaḷavu āvinillātu aṭupakal mālaiyum neñcum kāṇēṉ  
civaṉoṭu piramaṉ vaṇ tirumaṭantai cērtiruākam emāviīrum  
evaṉ iṉippukumiṭam? evaṉ ceykēṉō? ārukkueṉ collukēṉ aṉṉaimīrkāḷ!

**English translation of verse 9.9.6:**

His is indeed the only grace, Him to attain,  
And yet, it is so dear; my life I can’t hold on  
Till I do His grace obtain, the evening is on,  
Marking the day’s end, pity, I am left alone,  
My mind, my companion in solitude, I do miss,  
My Lord holds Civaṉ, Piramaṉ and Tirumaṭantai, all at once,  
On His lovely person and thus my soul enthrals;  
Ye, elders, what shall I do, where do I shelter take  
And to whom shall I my appeal make?

**Notes:**

“How is it”, the Nāyakī revolves in her mind, “the Lord, Who was anxiously looking out, for some one to be the recipient of His grace, has made it scarce, in my case?” Well, cannot one look up to some one else, for such grace? No, there is no grace but His and yet, the Saint cannot patiently await its descent in due course; his yearning soul can hardly be sustained except by the rapid influx of the Lord’s grace. “What a pity!”, the saint vexes himself, “I can’t have what these blokes, Kāpāli (Śiva, holding the skull in hand) and Kantar (Brahmā) could have easy access to”, referring to the allotment of space on His very person by the Lord for them. While the Lord’s navel is the seat of Brahmā, Tirumaṭantai (Lakṣmī) is inseparably poised on the Lord’s winsome chest and Śiva takes shelter in the space allotted on the right side of the Lord’s body, in times of grave emergency, as a measure of safety.




## 9.9.7
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஆருக்குஎன் சொல்லுகேன்? அன்னைமீர்காள்! ஆர்உயிர் அளவுஅன்று இக்கூர்தண்வாடை  
கார்ஒக்கும்மேனி நம்கண்ணன் கள்வம் கவர்ந்த அத்தனிநெஞ்சம் அவன்கண் அஃதே

pōruṟṟavāṭaitaṇ mallikaippūp putumaṇammukantukoṇṭu eṟiyumālō!

**English translation of verse 9.9.7:**

Kaṇṇaṉ, my cloud-hued Lord did my mind steal  
And in Him does it abide; the incense with fragrance filled.  
The music of the lyre, the cooing of the Koel, the sandal cool.  
The southerly breeze did all gather together and these are pitted  
Against poor me, along with the fragrance of jasmine, in fresh bloom;  
Ye, elders, unto whom shall 1 complain?  
The biting blast does my soul torment.

**Notes:**

The elderly ladies around derive comfort from the very things which oppress the Nāyakī, as if they have all conspired together to torment her. How then can they feel her pulse and sympathise with her? Verily, they just cannot follow the language of the Saint, soaked in God-love.




## 9.9.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

புதுமணம் முகந்துகொண்டு எறியும்ஆலோ! பொங்குஇளவாடை புன்செக்கர்ஆலோ  
அதுமணந்துஅகன்றநம் கண்ணன்கள்வம் கண்ணனில் கொடிது இனிஅதனில்உம்பர்

matumaṇa mallikai mantakkōvai vaṇpacumcāntiṉil pañcamamvaittu  
atumaṇantu iṉaruḷ āycciyarkkē ūtum attīmkuḻaṟkē uyyēṉnāṉ!

**English translation of verse 9.9.8:**

The chill blast does pierce me with increasing intensity  
And alas! it brings with it fragrance in its virginity,  
The crescent sky does its quota of misery add,  
Even more cruel than Kaṇṇaṉ are His covert deeds,  
The jasmine flowers, with honey and fragrance studded  
Do waft their gentle smell, the sandal, cool and nice,  
And the sweet amorous notes which Kaṇṇaṉ’s flute plays  
Unto the shepherd damsels, all these my life do flay.

**Notes:**

A series of things oppress the Nāyakī in her present state of desolation, as stated above. While the memory of her erstwhile union with the Lord haunts her and makes her feel that His deeds are even more cruel than Himself, the enchanting melody of His flute is the last straw to break her back. The last-mentioned alone is enough to take her life out.




## 9.9.9
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஊதும் அத்தீம்குழற்கே உய்யேன்நான்! அதுமொழிந்துஇடை இடைதன் செய்கோலத்

**English translation of verse 9.9.9:**

I can’t but succumb to the haunting melody of that pipe  
That does His amorous advances convey, now and then;  
His tell-tale eyes do His message speak with unique get-up,  
His tuneful songs do glances throw and His deep concern  
For girls with aching heart, His face reveals,  
The songs He sings, anxious to put them at ease,  
We hardly know; alas! evening has come  
But the wondrous one is yet to come.

**Notes:**

It is the enchanting melody of Kṛṣṇa’s flute, interspersed with significant statements, now and then, that disarms the Gopīs and makes them resile from the determined stand previously taken by them, not to mix with Him any longer. The Lord speaks through His eyes and sees through His tuneful songs. He is wondrous, in the sense, that even those, who were averse to Him, while in a state of desolation due to separation from Him, would feel remorseful for their erstwhile unrelenting attitude towards Him, when He eventually comes and mingles with them. So freely does He mingle with His devotees and, in the process, exhibit amazing simplicity.

**English translation of verse 9.9.10:**

Ha! evening has arrived but not my Lord; the comely cows mingle  
With the hefty bulls and their bells do tinkle,  
Alas! the sweet music of the flute is tantalizing, the bees do gather  
Honey from the white jasmine and many other flowers  
And diving deep into them do hum, the roaring sea rends the air;  
And now, how can I survive these that against me do conspire?

**Notes:**

Kṛṣṇa has not returned home at the appointed time; meanwhile quite a number of things oppress the Gopīs to such an extent that their mere survival becomes a problem.

**English translation of verse 9.9.11:**

Ye, devout workers, chant with delight over here, these songs ten,  
Out of the thousand composed, in sweet adoration  
Of the Lord Who the worlds ate up and then spat, by Caṭakōpaṉ  
Of Kurukūr Who did separation from Him lament,  
As did the bejewelled shepherdesses, one evening,  
Unable to brook separation from Kaṇṇaṉ, and salvation attain,  
Worshipping Tirumāl, [the Lord] mentioned therein

**Notes:**

This end-song reveals the benefit of chanting this decad, wherein the Āḻvār suffers the pangs of separation like unto those gone through by the Gopīs (damsels of Virundāvan [Vṛndāvana]) at dusk, unable to put up with the delayed appearance of Kṛṣṇa. The chanters of this decad are assured of salvation, namely, eternal service at the feet of the Lord, without their suffering the pangs of separation from the Lord, as in the case of the Gopīs and the Āḻvār.
