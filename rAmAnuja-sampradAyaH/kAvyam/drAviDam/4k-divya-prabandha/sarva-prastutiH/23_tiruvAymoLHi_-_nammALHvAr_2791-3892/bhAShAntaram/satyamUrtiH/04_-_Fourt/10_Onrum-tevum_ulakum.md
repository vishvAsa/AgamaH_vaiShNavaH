## 00 Intro4.10
The Āḻvār expressed his abhorrence of the ways of the world and lustily pleaded with the Lord, in the last decad, that he be removed at once from this infernal land. And yet, the Lord did not take him away but contrived to pacify him by exhibiting to him the heavenly splendour, right here, and to keep him on here. The Lord’s idea in doing so was to propagate, in this confounded world, the true knowledge about God-head, through the Āḻvār’s hymns, *par-excellence*, shorn of doubts, discrepancies and deviations. The Āḻvār seems to have taken due note of the Lord’s intentions; he preaches, in this decad, the Supremacy of Śrīmān Nārāyaṇa (Viṣṇu) and tries to disabuse the people of their mistaken notions in this regard and wean them away from the propitiation of other deities. Of course, the Āḻvār has already dwelt on the Supremacy of Lord Viṣṇu, in I-1 and II-2, based on His ‘Para’ (transcendent) and ‘Vibhava’ (incarnate) aspects, respectively. And now, he establishes the Lord’s Supremacy in His ‘Arca’ (iconic) aspect and, for this purpose, he concentrates on the Lord, enshrined in Kurukūr itself, as He bears the name, ‘Ādinātha’, the First Lord or Progenitor and it comes in handy to establish His Supremacy.

The Supreme Lord should obviously be the first cause of all things and beings. Who this One is can, however, be ascertained only from the Scriptures. Even without such a study, the Lord, in His ‘*Arca*’ (Idol) Form, compels attention and makes one instinctively cognise Him, as the causeless Cause, the Primordial Lord. Some might say that Brhamā, Viṣṇu and Śiva are all, on a par, of equal eminence. Some others might hold that there is yet another Power, superior to these three, which should be revered as the Supreme. In stanza 72 of his ‘Peria Tiruvantāti’, the Āḻvār corrects these misconceptions and avers that the lotus stalk which sprouted from the navel of Śrīman Nārāyaṇa (Viṣṇu), tells the true story. From this stalk emerged the four-headed Brahmā from whom Śiva, the five-headed, appeared and Śiva, in turn, gave rise to the six-headed Subramaṇya and so on, resulting in the many heads we see in the world.

In Chāndogya Upaniṣad, the text, ‘*Sadeva Somya idamagra āsīth*’ indicates ‘sat’ as the first Cause. In another Upaniṣad, the first Cause is indicated by the word ‘Ātmā’, in the text ‘*Ātma vā ayameka evāgra āsīth*’, while yet another upaniṣad employs the word ‘Brahmā’ to indicate this, in the text ‘*Brahmā vā idamekamevāgra āsīth*!’ While, in the above texts, the First Cause or the Ordainer of the Universe has been referred to, in such general terms as ‘*sat*’, ‘*Ātmā*’ and ‘*Brahmā*’, the text in Mahopaniṣad pin-points this Supreme Authority as Nārāyaṇa—‘*Ekohavai Nārāyaṇa āsīth na Brahmā neśānaḥ*’, that is, Nārāyaṇa was the only one then, when

Brahma, Īśāna and others were in the unevolved, subtle state. The Lord, Whose Supremacy is thus established only after such a herculean task as delving into the different texts of Vedāntas, is, however, easily accessible in Tirunakari (Kurukūr). The Āḻvār, therefore, calls upon people to worship the Lord in His iconic Form, right here, and be redeemed, instead of going adrift, running after lesser deities. Thus, this decad shakes off the stupor of the votaries of the minor deities and exhorts them to concentrate on the Supreme Lord, the one and only God.

There are very many persons, in this world, who are quite conversant with the scriptural texts in all their ramifications and yet, do not have a clear conviction as to who exactly is the Supreme Lord to whom they should owe undivided allegiance. These people, therefore, waver and bow unto a number of deities. The followers of Śrī Rāmānujācārya, however, stand out in dire contrast to these so-called learned men, and have unflinching faith in the Supremacy of Viṣṇu (Śrīman Nārāyaṇa), although they may not have any academic learning, as such, to their credit. This is, of course, due to the grace galore of Saint Nammāḻvār in bequeathing this decad to posterity, as Empār would put it. An illustration of this robust faith is given below.

Tripura Devi, the wife of Rājā Akaḷāṅkanāṭṭāḻvāṉ, in the holy fold of Śrī Rāmānuja’s faith, would not worship the idols of the minor Gods, although she was not quite literate. When asked to quote the authority supporting her conviction, the queen replied: “I know no authority other than the dictates of Śrī Rāmānuja, my Saviour. Should he command me so I would certainly worship even the deity guarding the north-east (Īśānya) point of the Compass, where our waste-water pots are kept”.




## 4.10.1
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஒன்றும் தேவும் உலகும் உயிரும் மற்றும் யாதும் இல்லா  
அன்று, நான்முகன் தன்னொடு தேவர் உலகோடு உயிர் படைத்தான்,  
குன்றம்போல் மணிமாடம் நீடு திருக்குருகூர் அதனுள்,  
நின்ற ஆதிப்பிரான் நிற்க மற்றைத் தெய்வம் நாடுதிரே. (2)

oṉṟum tēvum ulakum uyirum maṟṟum yātum illā  
aṉṟu, nāṉmukaṉ taṉṉoṭu tēvar ulakōṭu uyir paṭaittāṉ,  
kuṉṟampōl maṇimāṭam nīṭu tirukkurukūr ataṉuḷ,  
niṉṟa ātippirāṉ niṟka maṟṟait teyvam nāṭutirē. (2)

**English translation of verse 4.10.1:**

Ye, folks, why do you run after ether deities,  
When in holy Kurukūr with towering castles  
Is our Lord Āḻippirāṉ, unto one and all visible,  
The Progenitor who created Brahmā and other Celestials,  
The worlds, men and animals, when there was none of these?

**Notes**

\(i\) The Āḻvār deplores the fate of those who fail to worship Lord Ādinātha (Ātippirāṉ), the Supreme God, making Himself easily accessible to all, in Tirunakari (Kurukūr) and go past Him, in quest of lesser deities. This is just as absurd as a thirsty fellow trying hard to dig a well on the bank of Gaṅgā river, in order to quench his thirst, instead of drinking handfuls of the flowing water of Gaṅgā.

\(ii\) Creation is just the refunding into the gross state and assortment of the different entities as Devas, humans, etc., from the erstwhile subtle or unevolved state, when they could be hardly distinguished from inert matter and were as good as non-existent. (Īṭu)




## 4.10.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நாடி நீர் வணங்கும் தெய்வமும் உம்மையும் முன்படைத்தான்,  
வீடு இல் சீர்ப்புகழ் ஆதிப்பிரான் அவன் மேவி உறைகோயில்,  
மாட மாளிகை சூழ்ந்து அழகு ஆய திருக்குருகூர் அதனைப்  
பாடி ஆடி பரவிச் செல்மின்கள் பல் உலகீர்! பரந்தே.

nāṭi nīr vaṇaṅkum teyvamum ummaiyum muṉpaṭaittāṉ,  
vīṭu il cīrppukaḻ ātippirāṉ avaṉ mēvi uṟaikōyil,  
māṭa māḷikai cūḻntu aḻaku āya tirukkurukūr ataṉaip  
pāṭi āṭi paravic celmiṉkaḷ pal ulakīr! parantē.

**English translation of verse 4.10.2:**

Ye, men of this diverse world, move about all over,  
Dancing and singing the praise of lovely Kurukūr,  
By stately mansions surrounded, where lovingly resides  
Lord ‘Ātippirāṉ’ of traits, auspicious and abiding,  
Who created both you and the deities you revere.

**Notes**

\(i\) In this song, the Āḻvār exhorts the people of all sorts to converge into Tirunakari (Kurukūr) from different directions in great jubilation, dancing and singing the praise of that pilgrim centre, even as people congregate in a festive mood at Srirangam during the ‘big festival’ (Paṅkuṉi uttaram celebrations). The emphasis has now shifted from the Lord to the pilgrim centre where He lovingly resides and even the different routes leading thereto. The Lord loves the pilgrim centres on Earth even better than His stay in Heaven, where His heart always pines for the teeming millions of His straying subjects down below. Such an attitude is His crowning trait and it does not alter the fact that Heaven is a land of unalloyed bliss. In the midst of all that bliss. His heart leaps towards the weaker sections elsewhere, because of His tender solicitude.

\(ii\) It is Lord Viṣṇu, the Supreme, that ushered in all the subjects, classified under different denominations and so, worshipping the lesser deities amounts to the worship of one section of the Lord’s subjects, by another. The Āḻvār deprecates the men of this world running after these deities, searching for them, instead of searching for the Supreme Lord, as enjoined by the Scriptures, ‘*Sonveṣṭavyaḥ*’.

\(iii\) The Universal Father is the only Lord and all the others are His vassals. Whoever arrogate to themselves independence are veritable thieves. The lesser gods also are such thieves in as much as they gulp down the sacrificial food which should legitimately go to the Lord and when the sacrificers seek them with prayers for boons, they run away like thieves. These gods only rob from the sacrificers what is God’s own and they have nothing which they can call their own and grant.




## 4.10.3
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

பரந்த தெய்வமும் பல் உலகும் படைத்து அன்று உடனே விழுங்கி,  
கரந்து உமிழ்ந்து கடந்து இடந்தது கண்டும் தெளியகில்லீர்,  
சிரங்களால் அமரர் வணங்கும் திருக்குருகூர் அதனுள்,  
பரன் திறம் அன்றி பல் உலகீர்! தெய்வம் மற்று இல்லை பேசுமினே!

paranta teyvamum pal ulakum paṭaittu aṉṟu uṭaṉē viḻuṅki,  
karantu umiḻntu kaṭantu iṭantatu kaṇṭum teḷiyakillīr,  
ciraṅkaḷāl amarar vaṇaṅkum tirukkurukūr ataṉuḷ,  
paraṉ tiṟam aṉṟi pal ulakīr! teyvam maṟṟu illai pēcumiṉē!

**English translation of verse 4.10.3:**

There’s no God other than the One who did create  
The Universe vast, Devas and other denominations,  
Kept them all within Him (during deluge) and then spat,  
Who spanned the worlds in strides three and from the ocean  
Pulled the Earth out; how is it you aren’t clear yet,  
Ye. men of this diverse world, You’d better speak out  
If there is another beside the One by Devas revered  
In lovely Kurukūr, bowing low their heads.

**Note:**

The herculean tasks performed by the Lord Who created the worlds to protect them on different occasions, should be sufficient to dispel all doubts regarding His Supremacy. And yet, the worldlings are not clear-sighted, a distressing state of affairs indeed, according to the Āḻvār, the more so, when those very deities whom these people adore, come and worship the Lord in Kurukūr.




## 4.10.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

பேச நின்ற சிவனுக்கும் பிரமன் தனக்கும் பிறர்க்கும்  
நாயகன் அவனே, கபால நல் மோக்கத்துக் கண்டுகொண்மின்,  
தேச மாமதிள் சூழ்ந்து அழகு ஆய திருக்குருகூர் அதனுள்,  
ஈசன்பால் ஓர் அவம் பறைதல் என் ஆவது இலிங்கியர்க்கே?

pēca niṉṟa civaṉukkum piramaṉ taṉakkum piṟarkkum  
nāyakaṉ avaṉē, kapāla nal mōkkattuk kaṇṭukoṇmiṉ,  
tēca māmatiḷ cūḻntu aḻaku āya tirukkurukūr ataṉuḷ,  
īcaṉpāl ōr avam paṟaital eṉ āvatu iliṅkiyarkkē?

**English translation of verse 4.10.4:**

What use is it to the votaries of Iliṅkam, who take  
Their stand (on mere inference) and heresies talk  
About the Lord, in lovely Kurukūr enshrined,  
With smart and stately walls around?  
Learn, ye men, who talk of Civaṉ as God Supreme,  
From the way the skull in his hand was redeemed  
That He (Nārāyaṇa) is unto him, Brahmā and others, the Lord Supreme

**Notes:**

\(i\) Those who determine the Supremacy of God, purely on the basis of inference, as well as those who assert the Supremacy of Śiva (*Iliṅkam*) and Brahmā, are disabused of their wrong notions by this song. Basing their stand on certain texts, in isolation, some people affirm the Supremacy of Śiva and some others look upon Brahmā, as the Supreme. There are, however, various other texts establishing the Supremacy of Viṣṇu, Relying on these numerous texts, Saint Nammāḻvār has clarified the position here and asserted the overlordship of Viṣṇu.

\(ii\) The five-headed Siva, born of the five-headed Brahmā, abhorred the similarity between him and his sire and, in an uncontrollable moment, plucked out one of Brahmā’s heads, by way of removing the vexatious parity. The skull of the Father, however, stuck fast to the Son’s palm. On the advice of the Sages and Devas, Śiva went a-begging. The skull would not drop out, unless it was filled with the alms and unfortunately, it was never full. It was only when he went to Badri-nāth and appealed to Lord Nārāyaṇa that He gave alms, uttering the word ‘akṣaya [*akṣayaṃ*]’ (plenty) and instantly, the skull got completely filled up and dropped out of Śiva’s palm. Surely, neither the chopper nor the chopped could be the Supreme God.




## 4.10.5
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

இலிங்கத்து இட்ட புராணத்தீரும் சமணரும் சாக்கியரும்  
வலிந்து வாது செய்வீர்களும் மற்றும் நும் தெய்வமும் ஆகிநின்றான்  
மலிந்து செந்நெல் கவரி வீசும் திருக்குருகூர் அதனுள்,  
பொலிந்து நின்ற பிரான் கண்டீர் ஒன்றும் பொய் இல்லை போற்றுமினே. (2)

iliṅkattu iṭṭa purāṇattīrum camaṇarum cākkiyarum  
valintu vātu ceyvīrkaḷum maṟṟum num teyvamum ākiniṉṟāṉ  
malintu cennel kavari vīcum tirukkurukūr ataṉuḷ,  
polintu niṉṟa pirāṉ kaṇṭīr oṉṟum poy illai pōṟṟumiṉē. (2)

**English translation of verse 4.10.5:**

Ye, hardened perverts, led away by stories about Iliṅkam,  
Jains, Buddhists, heretics, one and all! you see, the Lord Supreme,  
Internal Controller of you and your deities, Polintuniṉṟapirāṉ does gleam  
In Tirukkurukūr with paddy fields rich, better worship Him,  
There isn’t any untruth whatever in what I proclaim.

**Notes**

\(i\) Addressing the aliens and heretics, the Āḻvār sums up beautifully the quintessence of the vedic texts and purāṇik teachings, other than those pertaining to the ‘Rājasik’ and ‘tāmasik’ varieties. He affirms that his addressees and the deities they revere (Agni, Śiva, Brahmā etc), are all controlled by Lord Viṣṇu, as the Supreme Controller, seated inside one and all. Unlike ‘Liṅga Purāṇa’ and other Purāṇas, which treat of the origin and prowess of particular deities and are prone, in the particular context, to exaggerate the importance of those demi-gods, Śri Viṣṇu Purāṇa says, in reply to a general question as to who is the Supreme God who brings into being all things and lives and finally dissolves them, that Viṣṇu controls all the three functions of creation, sustentation and dissolution. And this Supreme Lord, the Āḻvār now points out, is right here in Kurukūr, in His Area (iconic) manifestation, wherein all His superlative excellences converge in a perfect measure as His name, ‘Polintu niṉṟa pirāṉ’ connotes. This being the dark land of nescience, His great qualities shine here far better than in Heaven, where it is all day and no night, that is, all light and no darkness.

The Āḻvār avers that what he says is perfectly true, as there is no need for him to import greatness to the Lord Who is greatness itself unlike the demi-gods who need special boosting to prop them up.




## 4.10.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

போற்றி மற்று ஓர் தெய்வம் பேணப் புறத்திட்டு உம்மை இன்னே  
தேற்றி வைத்தது எல்லீரும் வீடு பெற்றால் உலகு இல்லை என்றே,  
சேற்றில் செந்நெல் கமலம் ஓங்கு திருக்குருகூர் அதனுள்,  
ஆற்ற வல்லவன் மாயம் கண்டீர் அது அறிந்து அறிந்து ஓடுமினே.

pōṟṟi maṟṟu ōr teyvam pēṇap puṟattiṭṭu ummai iṉṉē  
tēṟṟi vaittatu ellīrum vīṭu peṟṟāl ulaku illai eṉṟē,  
cēṟṟil cennel kamalam ōṅku tirukkurukūr ataṉuḷ,  
āṟṟa vallavaṉ māyam kaṇṭīr atu aṟintu aṟintu ōṭumiṉē.

**English translation of verse 4.10.6:**

Know, ye, men adoring the lesser deities,  
‘Tis your past *Karma* that has kept you in this state,  
Away from the goal of emancipation, under śāstraic restraint;  
Better realise you can this ocean of *māya* ford  
Only if you can get hold of the Almighty Lord  
Who resides in Tirukkurukūr with fields fertile and lotus ponds fine,  
And knowing this, do unto His feet hasten.

**Note**

To a question supposed to have been put to the Āḻvār by the votaries of minor deities, as to why Śrīman Nārāyaṇa, declared by him, in so many ways as the Supreme Lord, did not bend them towards Him, instead of allowing them to drift in the manner they were doing, adoring the lesser gods, this song provides the answer. It is because of the heavy sins committed by them in the past that they have been tied down to their present lot of worshipping lesser deities, with the result that their emancipation from the dreadful cycle of birth and death and attaining Heaven have also been put off. Their hopes of redemption, therefore lie only in taking refuge at the feet of the Supreme Lord in His worshippable Form in Kurukūr. c.f. the Lord’s statement in Bhagavad Gītā, (7-14) that only those who take refuge in Him, cross beyond this ‘māyā’, [prakriti][?] which helps their liberation instead of hindering it by concealing His real nature, as it does, in the case of the non-seekers of His grace.




## 4.10.7
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஓடி ஓடி பல பிறப்பும் பிறந்து மற்று ஓர் தெய்வம்,  
பாடி ஆடிப் பணிந்து பல்படிகால் வழி ஏறிக் கண்டீர்,  
கூடி வானவர் ஏத்த நின்ற திருக்குருகூர் அதனுள்,  
ஆடு புள் கொடி ஆதி மூர்த்திக்கு அடிமைபுகுவதுவே

ōṭi ōṭi pala piṟappum piṟantu maṟṟu ōr teyvam,  
pāṭi āṭip paṇintu palpaṭikāl vaḻi ēṟik kaṇṭīr,  
kūṭi vāṉavar ētta niṉṟa tirukkurukūr ataṉuḷ,  
āṭu puḷ koṭi āti mūrttikku aṭimaipukuvatuvē

**English translation of verse 4.10.7:**

Serve you did for ages and in many ways,  
The lesser gods, passing thro’ several gates of birth,  
Well have you seen the extent of their so-called grace;  
Better seek refuge at the feet of Lord Ātināta,  
With the bird (Garuḍa) on His banner, enshrined in Kurukūr,  
For Devas, in their strength, to come and revere.

**Notes**

\(i\) The text, “brahmāṇaṃ śitikaṇṭañ ca yās cānyā devatāḥ smṛtāḥ, pratibuddhā na sevante yasmāt parimitaṃ phalam” says that knowledgeable persons do not worship Brahmā, Śiva and other lesser deities, as the benefits derived thereby are much-too-slender and limited. The Āḻvār, therefore, exhorts people to seek refuge in Lord Ātinātha, in lovely Kurukūr. The very fact that these people have been worshipping the god-lings in myriads of ways through countless births and have still not been able to get rid of the dreadful cycle of birth and rebirth, shows that these deities could do precious little for their emancipation. What is even more noteworthy is that those very deities throng round the Lord, enshrined in Kurukūr and sing His praise to their hearts’ content.

\(ii\) Actually, these deities derive all their power from Lord Viṣṇu, the Supreme Lord, see also 1-1-5; again, in spite of their internal bickerings, these deities join together in the face of a common danger and propitiate the Lord, in a body. The Āḻvār, therefore, advises his addressees to seek refuge at the Lord’s feet with immovable faith. In his scintillating commentary, Nam-piḷlai cites, as examples of such robust faith, king Ambarīṣa and Saint Tirumaḻicai Āḻvār.

In order to test Ambarīṣa’s steadfastness the Lord appeared before the King, disguised as Indra, mounted on Airāvata, the white elephant (which again was but Garuḍa, the Lord’s mount, in disguise) and offered to grant him boons.

Pat came the King’s admonition, as follows:

> “Who are you and what is this insect you have brought with you? Don’t
> you know that I am votary of Lord viṣṇu from whom all of you derive
> your position and authority. Surely, I am not the one who would pay
> homage to strollers like you, passing along the streets. May it please
> you to depart from here”.

Saint Tirumaḻicai Āḻvār (BC 4202) was sitting with his legs stretched, stitching his torn-out garments, when Śiva and Pārvati passed by. The Āḻvār’s nonchalance, unmindful of the presence of the exalted couple, provoked Pārvati and, at her insistence, an indignant Śiva demanded the Āḻvār’s explanation for his disrespectful behaviour. Calm and unruffled, the Āḻvār queried whether the distinguished visitor could grant him salvation (mokṣa) but the latter said, “No, it is beyond my jurisdiction; it can be attained only by resorting to Viṣṇu”. The considerate Āḻvār, thereupon asked Śiva whether he could postpone the death of creatures, at least by a day. On his betraying his helplessness once again, the Āḻvār jeeringly asked the visitor to decree that the thread, the former was holding, did follow the needle as he was sewing. Unable to brook this insult, Śiva opened up the third eye on his forehead but the Saint overpowered it by pointing to the innumerable such eyes in his leg.

\(iii\) There is yet another anecdote, cited in Īṭu commentary, to illustrate the certainty of salvation through oneness of faith in the Supreme Lord.

When Śrī Parāśara Bhaṭṭar was once reading that portion of Viṣṇu Purāṇa, dealing with the life of the meritorious King Yayāti whom Indra conspired to pull down apprehensive of the usurpation of his own position, two of the listeners, Piḻḷai Viḻupparaiyar and Appāṉ Tiruvaḷuntur Araiyar asked the learned discourser about the chief lesson to be learnt from the life-story of king Yayāti. Bhaṭṭarya elucidated: “Here is the lesson; the lesser gods, when propitiated, grant men their desires, but, side by side, envy rankles in the hearts of the former over the latter’s mounting stature and they seek an opportunity to pull the votaries down, to prevent their drawing level with those very gods. On the other hand, Lord Viṣṇu looks upon His creatures’ happiness as His own and He can never be swayed by such base passions as the lesser gods. One should not, therefore, resort to lesser gods but place all one’s faith in the Supreme Lord”.

\(iv\) Bhaṭṭārya also cited the example of Lord Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa serving Sage Viśvāmitra as his humble servants. On being questioned at this stage how the Yādhavas came to grief, in spite of their close association with Lord Kṛṣṇa, Bhattārya pointed out that the Yādhavas had to share the fate they did, because of their irreclaimable ways, although Lord Kṛṣṇa did His very best for them, such as bringing from Kubera, the God of wealth, Treasures such as ‘Śaṅka nidhi’ and ‘Padma nidhi’. Further, they looked upon Kṛṣṇa, not as God but as a mere kinsman, companion and so on, an ephemeral passing relationship which automatically lapsed at the end of their lives.




## 4.10.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

புக்கு அடிமையினால் தன்னைக் கண்ட மார்க்கண்டேயன் அவனை  
நக்க பிரானும் அன்று உய்யக்கொண்டது நாராயணன் அருளே  
கொக்கு அலர் தடம் தாழை வேலித் திருக்குருகூர் அதனுள்

kokku alar taṭam tāḻai vēlit tirukkurukūr ataṉuḷ  
mikka ātippirāṉ niṟka maṟṟait teyvam viḷamputirē

**English translation of verse 4.10.8:**

‘Tis the grace of Nārāyaṇaṉ Whom Nakkapirāṉ (Śiva) did invoke  
That succoured Mārkkaṇṭēyaṉ (from Yama’s yoke)  
And made the latter peep into His stomach and have a look  
(At Śiva) inside; the Lord Supreme now stands enshrined  
As Ātippirāṉ, in Kurukūr with lovely hedges, white as the crane;  
Why then do you at all about other deities mention?

**Note**

Some persons would appear to have objected to the Āḻvār under-rating Śiva, despite his fame as Mārkaṇṭēya’s Saviour, who successfully resisted Yama’s attempt to take away the devotee’s life, at the tender age of sixteen. The Āḻvār now disabuses them of their wrong notions about that episode by giving them the correct perspective in this regard. Sage Mṛkaṇḍu’s ardent prayers for the grant of a son were heard by Brahmā who, however, asked the Sage to opt for either a son, deformed and devilish, with a long life or one brilliant and beautiful, but short-lived, his term of life not extending beyond sixteen years. The Sage having indicated his preference to a son of the latter category, he was gifted with the gem of a son, Mārkaṇḍeya. As the little lad was approaching the end of his brief tenure of life, the parents were throbbing with painful anguish. The young one, however, placated them by asserting that he could surely overcome the ordeal through the good offices of Śiva whom he worshipping intensely. At the zero hour, when the boy completed sixteen years of age, Yama’s hordes came down to snatch him away but the aura of his piety for Śiva was such that they could not get anywhere near him. They went and reported this strange phenomenon to their boss who sent his Minister Kālaṉ who fared no better. The infuriated Yama himself came and threw his life-snatching cord along, which, however, encircled the idol of Śiva also, Mārkaṇḍeya was then embracing tight. Śiva meditated on Śrīman Nārāyaṇa and with His grace, he emerged forth from inside the idol, kicked yama out and blessed Mārkaṇḍeya with perpetual life and perennial youth. Although the superficial reader takes it that it was Śiva who rescued Mārkaṇḍeya from Yama’s clutches, the truth of the matter is that it was Śrīman Nārāyaṇa, as the Supreme Lord and Internal Controller of Śiva, among others, who did the job, as narrated by Mārkaṇḍeya himself to Yudhiṣṭira, (see Maha Bhārata, Āraṇya Parva, chapter 192[^1] that he (Mārkaṇḍeya) sought refuge in Śrīman Nārāyaṇa. This is also corroborated by the eighth chapter of the twelfth Skanda of Śrī Bhāgavata which clearly says[^2] that by propitiating Śrīman Nārāyaṇa, Mārkaṇḍeya defied Yama and conquered death.

[^1]:  Pitrubhaktosi Viprarṣe! māñcaiva śaraṇaṃ gataḥ.

[^2]:  Ārādhayan Hṛṣīkeṣam jigye mṛtyuṃ sudurjayam.

As a matter of fact, Śiva who was immensely pleased with Mārkaṇḍeya’s devotion, wanted to reward him suitably and, therefore, put him on to Śrīman Nārāyaṇa, Whom he (Śiva) himself was worshipping. Mārkaṇḍeya, blessed with immortality, prayed intensely to Śrīman Nārāyaṇa that he might be allowed to witness the Deluge (Mahāpralaya). Swimming across the vast expanse of water, he could not merely have access to the Lord reclining, as a mere babe, on a tender fig-leaf afloat but he was also allowed to peep inside the Lord’s stomach. Seeing inside the Lord’s stomach, one and all, including Śiva, whom he had been worshipping for long, Mārkaṇḍeya had no longer any doubts about Śrīman Nārāyaṇa’s Supremacy. He took refuge in Him and was admitted by the Lord unto His fold.

And measure the glory of ‘Āḻippirāṉ’ the Primordial Lord,  
Who, in fertile Kurukūr, cool and lovely, has His abode;  
Better keep Him for ever in your mind firmly lodged  
If you are keen on your salvation indeed.

**Note**

The aliens are those who do not admit the authority of the Vedas and the Śāstras expounding them. The six systems of such aliens are: ‘Śākhya’ (Buddhists), ‘Ulukya [Ulūkya?]’ (Cārvākas), ‘Kṣapaṇa’ (Jains), ‘Akṣapāda’ (Naiyāyikas), ‘Kapila’ and ‘Patañjali’. And then, there are those perverts or heretics who admit the authority of the Vedas but not in their entirety. They also misinterpret the texts and say that God has no form and no attributes, reducing Him to the position of a vast wilderness, mere icy abstract, cold and colourless. Both the aliens and the heretics are thus bungling in their own ways. These people cannot, therefore, comprehend the Lord’s cosmic wealth and gauge the extent of His glory, which is unfathomable and unlimited.




## 4.10.10
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

உறுவது ஆவது எத்தேவும் எவ் உலகங்களும் மற்றும்தன்பால்,  
மறு இல் மூர்த்தியோடு ஒத்து இத்தனையும் நின்றவண்ணம் நிற்கவே,  
செறுவில் செந்நெல் கரும்பொடு ஓங்கு திருக்குருகூர் அதனுள்  
குறிய மாண் உரு ஆகிய நீள் குடக் கூத்தனுக்கு ஆள் செய்வதே.

uṟuvatu āvatu ettēvum ev ulakaṅkaḷum maṟṟumtaṉpāl,  
maṟu il mūrttiyōṭu ottu ittaṉaiyum niṉṟavaṇṇam niṟkavē,  
ceṟuvil cennel karumpoṭu ōṅku tirukkurukūr ataṉuḷ  
kuṟiya māṇ uru ākiya nīḷ kuṭak kūttaṉukku āḷ ceyvatē.

**English translation of verse 4.10.10:**

‘Tis but meet that you should serve the immaculate Lord  
Whose bodies, the Devas all, the worlds many and all else are,  
Who did as the celebrated midget (Vāmana) descend  
As well as (Kaṇṇaṉ), the pot-dancer grand  
And now in Tirukkurukūr, in full splendour stands,  
Amid bumper sugarcane crops and rich paddy fields.

**Note**

Indra, Candra, Kubera and all other Devas as well as all the worlds, with their contents, sentient and non-sentient, are like unto the Lord’s bodies, directed, controlled and supported by Him. That Lord resides in Kurukūr (Āḻvār-Tirunakari), in unabated splendour. The Āḻvār, therefore, calls upon people to come and worship this Lord, going by the name of ‘Ātinātan’ standing firmly in Kurukūr and get redeemed.




## 4.10.11
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஆள் செய்து ஆழிப் பிரானைச் சேர்ந்தவன் வண் குருகூர்நகரான்  
நாள் கமழ் மகிழ் மாலை மார்பினன் மாறன் சடகோபன்,  
வேட்கையால் சொன்ன பாடல் ஆயிரத்துள் இப்பத்தும் வல்லார்,  
மீட்சி இன்றி வைகுந்த மாநகர் மற்றது கையதுவே. (2)

āḷ ceytu āḻip pirāṉaic cērntavaṉ vaṇ kurukūrnakarāṉ  
nāḷ kamaḻ makiḻ mālai mārpiṉaṉ māṟaṉ caṭakōpaṉ,  
vēṭkaiyāl coṉṉa pāṭal āyirattuḷ ippattum vallār,  
mīṭci iṉṟi vaikunta mānakar maṟṟatu kaiyatuvē. (2)

**English translation of verse 4.10.11:**

Those that can recite these songs ten,  
Out of the thousand sung with deep devotion  
By Kurukūr Caṭakōpaṉ, wearing on his chest,  
The fragrant narcissus garland and blest  
By the Lord donning the discus, to render Him service grand.  
By turning unto God the wayward worldlings,  
Are assured of the eternal Kingdom in Heaven.

**Notes:**

\(i\) In the original text of this song, it has been said that the Āḻvār attained the Lord donning the discus, through service. The finale is, however, yet to come and he has to wait till X-10. The service rendered by the Āḻvār by hymning the Lord’s peerless glory and clearly establishing His Supremacy, in this decad, is unique. The votaries of the minor gods have been weaned away, *en masse*, through the Āḻvār’s grand exposition, in this decad and all of them have become ardent followers of Viṣṇu, a great feat indeed, not achieved even by the Almighty Lord.

\(ii\) Saint Nammāḻvār, known in Sanskrit parlance as Vaku-lābharaṇa, is said to have been wearing the narcissus garland with perennial fragrance. Śrī Vedānta Deśika has said in his ‘Yatirāja-Saptathi’ that the fragrance of the narcissus permeates ‘Tiruvāymoḻi’(Dramiḍa Veda) as well, whereas such an exhilarating fragrance cannot be found in the Sanskrit Vedas which are indeed the poorer for it.




## Retrospective Summary
(4-1): The Āḻvār’s tender solicitude and irrepressible fellow-feeling induce him to turn his attention to the world once again and that too, so soon after his repulsion in UI-9. *In the opening decad of this Centum*, the straying subjects are called upon by him to eschew the so-called material wealth, much-too-flimsy and fleeting, and realise the importance of holding on to the Supreme Lord, the wealth Supreme and everlasting, unlike the earthly monarchs who once held supreme away, being ground to mere bits of dust and reduced to abject beggary in one and the same span of life;

(4-2): The Āḻvār’s advice, as in the first decad, to an unresponsive world has only served to excite his own God-love to such an extent that he longs for the ‘tuḷaci’ (basil leaves) worn on the Lord’s feet, during His Avatāras, in the days gone-by and feels frustrated due to the immediate non-fulfilment of his aspiration by the Lord. The Āḻvār becomes insensate, like a female forsaken by her lover after their erstwhile union and the gnostic mother steps in to describe the critical condition of her daughter (Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī), as *in the second decad*. It is, however, clear from the end-song of this decad that the Lord did, at last, oblige the Āḻvār and regale him;

(4-3): Time being at the beck and call of the Supreme Lord, He could certainly fulfil the aspiration of the Āḻvār, as in the second decad, and regale Him. *In the third decad*, a fully satisfied Āḻvār gives expression to his immense joy over the unique blending of his soul with the Lord, with perfect reciprocity of connubial love;

(4-4): Apprehending that overwhelming divine ecstasy, as in the third decad, might jeopardise the Āḻvār’s very existence, the Lord reduced the tempo a little, just to stabilise the Āḻvār’s God-enjoyment. Even this upsets the Āḻvār, whom we see, *in the fourth decad*, transformed once again, as the Nāyakī (female lover), in a state of heavy depression. She runs after the objects bearing the likeness of the Lord in one respect or another but disenchantment, on nearer approach, makes her sweat with disappointment and wither down. The gnostic mother steps in and relates the pitiable condition of her love-smitten daughter and the words she utters. The merciful Lord, however, presents Himself before the Āḻvār towards the end of this decad and puts the Āḻvār back on his feet.

(4-5): Visualising, right from where he is, the Lord’s cosmic wealth and splendour, the Āḻvār sings, *in the fifth decad*, with cymbals in hand, the Lord’s glory to his heart’s fill and goes into raptures. It seems as though the Lord had called upon the Āḻvār to sing His glory so that it can acquire special lustre through his laudation. (*The spiritual vicissitudes of the Āḻvār, alternating between satiate and disconsolate states are studiously engineered by the Lord, in order to enrich and intensify the Āḻvār’s God-love and stabilise his God-enjoyment, by stages*);

(4-6): *In the sixth decad*, we see the Āḻvār, once again consigned to the bottom-most depths of dejection, transformed (figuratively) as a Nāyakī, insensate and thus unable to speak out her woes, the Lord having once more withdrawn Himself from the Āḻvār’s mental vision. It is the Nāyakī’s mate, who speaks out in this decad, extremely critical that she is of the wrong steps taken by the elders around, such as propitiation of minor deities with meat and liquor, to cure the Nāyakī of her strange malady, misled by a female gipsy whom they had approached for divining the cause of the malady. The recipe strongly suggested by the mate who vehemently condemned the activities of the elders, is that the holy names of Lord Viṣṇu be uttered in the Nāyakī’s hearing besides sprinkling on her the dust collected from the feet of the Lord’s pious devotees;

(4-7): As the holy names of the Lord trickled down his ears, the Āḻvār regained consciousness but kept pondering how the Lord, the friend-in-need, capable of dispensing the appropriate remedies, could keep away from him. Unable to stand the separation from the Lord, the Āḻvār cries out his heart, *in the seventh decad*, so lustily that it melts down even the stony hearts of his listeners:

(4-8): Continuing in the feminine state, the frustrated Āḻvār laments *in the eighth decad*, that neither he nor his possessions (bangles, garments, complexion etc.) deserved to exist, so long as he was not in the good books of the Lord, as evidenced by the absence of response to his passionate appeal, as in the seventh decad;

(4-9); *In the ninth decad*, the Āḻvār displays his intolerance of living in the midst of the worldlings, with their stupid pursuits, straying away from Him, with the serious risk of his straying back into the domain of the sensual pleasures, under the cruel impact of the five senses and the domineering senseorgans. As in the case of salvation, the Āḻvār has to depend upon the Lord even for this kind of dissolution and hence his dialogue with the Lord, as in this decad, to get him removed from the wretched surroundings;

(4-10); Having already dwelt on the Supremacy of Lord Viṣṇu, in His ‘Para’ (transcendent) and ‘Vibhava’ (Incarnate) aspects, in I-I and II-2 respectively, the Āḻvār proceeds, *in the concluding decad oj this centum*, to establish His supremacy, in His Area (Iconic) manifestation, as well. For this purpose, the Āḻvār concentrates on Lord Ātinātha, the First Lord or Progenitor, enshrined in Kurukūr, the Āḻvār’s birth-place, whose exquisite Form compels attention and makes one instinctively cognise Him as the Supreme Lord, the causeless Cause, the Primordial One. The Āḻvār calls upon people to worship the Lord in His iconic Form, right here and be redeemed of their age-long sins, instead of going adrift, running after lesser deities. Thus, this decad shakes off the stupor of the votaries of the minor deities and exhorts them to concentrate on the Supreme God, the one and only God.
