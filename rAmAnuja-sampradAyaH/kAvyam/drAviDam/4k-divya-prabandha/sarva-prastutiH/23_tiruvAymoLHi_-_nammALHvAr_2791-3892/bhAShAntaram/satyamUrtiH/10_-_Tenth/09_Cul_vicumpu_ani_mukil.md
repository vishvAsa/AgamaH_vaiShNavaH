## 00 Intro10.9
In the last decad, the Āḻvār had put the Lord, a very inconvenient question and thereby put Him in quite an embarrassing predicament. Shorn of all quibblings, the Lord would have had to say, in reply, that it was in the exercise of His unbridled independence that He had kept the Āḻvār, deep down in the mire of Saṃsāra for ages, and now, invoking the self-same trait of His, He has been pleased to extend all the favours, currently enjoyed by the Āḻvār. It would, however, be hardly appropriate for Him to say so, especially at this crucial juncture. For Him, it was now a veritable battle of wits and He skilfully tried to tide over this unenviable situation, rather, cover it up by calling upon the clouds and the oceans to roar like an orchestra, heralding the Āḻvār’s ascent to Heaven and the inhabitants of all the seven islands to bestow on him their choicest offerings. This is how the errant priest, officiating at marriage ceremonies, covers up his inadvertent mistakes in regard to the recital of the Mantras, that is, mixing up the wrong texts pertaining to the funeral obsequies, in between. On such occasions, which might, of course, be few and far between, the clever priest covers his awkwardness by vociferously commanding the piper and the drummer to play their notes in a crescendo, thereby drowning his egregious blunder in that babel.

The sweet music and the fanfare of trumpets etc., from the land of the Kinnaras, the Gandharvas and the Garuḍas in the upper regions, hailing the Āḻvār’s ascent to Heaven, are made to fall on the ears of the Āḻvār; the chanks and bugles sound all over, beautiful damsels with spear-shaped eyes sing in chorus the Āḻvār’s glory and the ‘Maruth Gaṇas’ and the ‘Aṣṭa Vasus’ keep chanting the ‘Stotras’, the laudatory hymns continually. The upward journey of the Āḻvār to Heaven through the famous “Arcirādi Mārga”, the propitiation of the Āḻvār by the Angels, *en route*, the Āḻvār’s entry into Heaven and the grand ovation accorded to him by the denizens on the yonder side, his access to the gem-set hall where Lord Mahāviṣṇu holds His ceremonial Durbar, duly conducted by the guides nominated for the purpose, and attainment of the Lord’s lotus feet—the whole panorama is brought by the Lord within the Āḻvār’s mental comprehension. The Āḻvār voices forth his experience, in this decad, in an esoteric manner, making it appear that the devotees of the Supreme Lord Śrīman Nārāyaṇa, Who ascended Heaven through this exalted route exclusively earmarked for them, were greeted all along the route and received with special honours by the denizens of the upper regions, showering praises on the new-comers, so on and so forth. It could also be deduced that the Āḻvār thereby intended to infuse confidence in the Śrī Vaiṣṇavas, the ardent devotees of Lord Mahā-Viṣṇu, that they too shall surely attain the bliss, currently experienced by the Āḻvār.




## 10.9.1
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

சூழ்விசும் பணிமுகில் தூரியம் முழக்கின  
ஆழ்கடல் அலைதிரைக் கைஎடுத்து ஆடின  
ஏழ்பொழிலும் வளம்ஏந்திய என்அப்பன்

ēḻpoḻilum vaḷamēntiya eṉappaṉ  
vāḻpukaḻ nāraṇaṉ tamaraik kaṇṭuukantē. (2)

**English translation of verse 10.9.1:**

The comely clouds in the sprawling sky did music roar,  
The surging waves of the deep seas danced with joy, gifts rare,  
The inhabitants of the islands seven did in their hands bear,  
To greet with great joy, the on-coming devotees of my Sire  
The beneficent Nāraṇaṉ of undying fame.

**Notes:**

\(i\) This song describes the ecstatic manner in which even the inanimate clouds, which decorate the sprawling sky and the surging waves of the deep seas, came forward to greet the devotees of Lord Śrīman Nārāyaṇa of undying fame, during their ascent to the high Heavens. All the seven islands wore a festive appearance and their inhabitants, one and all, held, in their hands, their choicest gifts to be offered to these Heaven-bound souls.

\(ii\) What a grand poetic imagery! When the clouds sang, the waves of the seas danced in accompaniment. It was all spontaneous, not made to order. When the Prince moves round, it is but meet that all those owing allegiance to the king should gieet the royal visitor.




## 10.9.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நாரணன் தமரைக் கண்டுஉகந்து நல்நீர்முகில்  
பூரண பொன்குடம் பூரித்தது உயர்விண்ணில்  
நீரணி கடல்கள் நின்றுஆர்த்தன நெடுவரைத்-  
தோரணம் நிரைத்து எங்கும் தொழுதனர்உலகே.

nāraṇaṉ tamaraik kaṇṭuukantu nalnīrmukil

nīraṇi kaṭalkaḷ niṉṟuārttaṉa neṭuvarait-  
tōraṇam niraittu eṅkum toḻutaṉarulakē.

**English translation of verse 10.9.2:**

Up in the sky, the joyous clouds, laden with water fine,  
Received with honour great, Lord Nārāyaṇa’s votaries,  
Presenting unto them gold vessels containing water,  
With coconut laid on top, the deep waters of the oceans  
Did standing ovation give while the denizens  
Of all the worlds set up festive banners, long and tall.

**Notes:**

Not satisfied with mere roaring with joy, as set out in the last song, the clouds present the ceremonial ‘Pūrṇa Kumba’ (vessel containing water, having coconut as the lid) to the distinguished sojourners; likewise, the oceanic waves, that danced, keep on expressing their joy. The denizens of the upper worlds vie with each other in setting up mammoth banners and buntings for greeting the Lord’s votaries, during their ascent to heaven.




## 10.9.3
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

தொழுதனர் உலகர்கள் தூபநல் மலர்மழை-  
பொழிவனர் பூமிஅன்று அளந்தவன் தமர்முன்னே  
எழுமின்என்று இருமருங்குஇசைத்தனர் முனிவர்கள்

eḻumiṉeṉṟu irumaruṅkuicaittaṉar muṉivarkaḷ  
vaḻiitu vaikuntarkku eṉṟu vantu etirē.

**English translation of verse 10.9.3:**

Unto the devotees of the Lord Who once spanned the worlds,  
The denizens of the upper worlds did incense burn and showered  
Flowers fine; the sages did their silence break and adored  
These marchers to Heaven, welcoming them all the way; arrayed  
On both sides, they did these dignitaries duly escort.

**Notes:**

There are certain upper worlds, charged with the special responsibility of guiding and conducting the released souls in their onward march to heaven. Those denizens are shown here as revering the new-comers by burning incense before them and showering on them choice flowers of outstanding fragrance. Even the sages came forward, breaking their normal vow of silence, to welcome these Heaven-bound souls and escort them.




## 10.9.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

எதிர்எதிர் இமையவர் இருப்பிடம் வகுத்தனர்  
கதிரவர்அவரவர் கைந்நிரை காட்டினர்  
அதிர்குரல் முரசங்கள் அலைகடல் முழக்குஒத்த  
மதுவிரி துழாய்முடி மாதவன் தமர்க்கே.

etiretir imaiyavar iruppiṭam vakuttaṉar  
katiravaravaravar kainnirai kāṭṭiṉar  
atirkural muracaṅkaḷ alaikaṭal muḻakkuotta  
matuviri tuḻāymuṭi mātavaṉ tamarkkē.

**English translation of verse 10.9.4:**

The Celestials marched ahead of the devotees of Mātavaṉ  
Who does on His crown wear honey-studded tuḷaci garland,  
And put up inns to lodge *en route* these souls Heaven-bound;  
The twelve Katiravars and other escorts took them along,  
Showing things around, the drums they played, bellowing  
Like the roaring of the seas with surging waves.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The Devas in the upper regions, are said to manifest their great joy over the heavenly ascent of the devotees of Mādhava, by playing music, *en route*, and putting up nice halting camps in enchanting surroundings, where the distinguished marchers might possibly alight and relax themselves. Even if these special camps, studiously set up by the Devas in their eagerness to serve the Heaven-bound souls, are not eventually used by the latter, the former will have the immense satisfaction of having discharged their duty, in keeping with their essential nature. There is no element of exaggeration in this, as will be borne out by those

of us who are aware of the fact that pots of money are lavished on the face-lift of buildings and thoroughfares. which our top state-dignitaries are likely to pass through, just one after-noon. It has also turned out, in a few cases, that the V.I.P. for whose approbation or at least the avoidance of his or her displeasure, lakhs of rupees were spent overnight towards repairs and renovation of roads, erection of buntings and festoons, etc., *en route*, did not visit the place at all, due either to the cancellation of the proposed visit or last minute changes entailing the adoption of a different route altogether.

\(ii\) In his famous Īṭu Commentary, Nampiḷḷai deplores how these very Śrī Vaiṣṇvas, who are given such V.I.P. treatment by the denizens of the upper worlds, are, during their stay in this abode, despised and neglected by men over here. Well, the Śrī Vaiṣṇavas have nothing to worry. On the other hand, they shall rejoice if they were put down by those who hated them merely on the ground of their being the worshippers of Lord Viṣṇu, as the episode of Miḷakāḻvāṉ, already set out in the notes below III-5-5 and reproduced here as well, will show.

A certain Rājā, a rabid opponent of Vaiṣṇavism, built a number of houses for being gifted away to the poor. When Miḷakāḻvāṉ approached the Rājā for the grant of one of these houses to him, the Rājā flatly declined. When asked by the supplicant the grounds on which he was refused the hospitality, the Rājā made no secret of his aversion for Vaiṣṇavāites and broke out: “No doubt, You are worthy in other respects, but as a Śrī Vaiṣṇava and a disciple of Śrī Rāmānuja, You stand disqualified.”

So great was Miḷakāḻvāṉ’s love of his religion and his great preceptor that he exclaimed:

“Oh, is that so? I am mighty glad, you recognise me as a Vaiṣṇava, although I thought I was not worthy of being called one”, So saying, he gathered up his garment, threw it up in the air and danced in sheer joy. This goes to show that the frowns of men, over here, are of no consequence to those souls, consumed by the fire of divine love. Did not the unrelenting repulsion of Vibhīṣaṇa, as the family traitor by the irate Rāvaṇa, prove a great blessing to the former?




## 10.9.5
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மாதவன் தமர்என்று வாசலில் வானவர்  
போதுமின் எமதுஇடம் புகுதுக என்றலும்  
கீதங்கள் பாடினர் கின்னரர் கெருடர்கள்  
வேதநல் வாயவர் வேள்விஉள் மடுத்தே.

mātavaṉ tamareṉṟu vācalil vāṉavar  
pōtumiṉ ematuiṭam pukutuka eṉṟalum  
kītaṅkaḷ pāṭiṉar kiṉṉarar keruṭarkaḷ  
vētanal vāyavar vēḷviuḷ maṭuttē.

**English translation of verse 10.9.5:**

The Celestials did in the outer space assemble and revere  
The great marchers to Heaven, saying “Here they are,  
The devotees of Mātavaṉ” and welcomed them to their places;  
The Vedic scholars of the upper worlds did unto them release  
And bestow the benefits earned by their rites and rituals,  
While the Kinnaras and Karuṭas sang many a song.

**Notes:**

The Celestials came out into the open to greet the devotees of Lord Mādhava Who bears Śrī Mahālakṣmī on His chest, as the favourite wards of the Divine Mother. The distinguished marchers to Heaven were accorded a warm reception by the Celestials who invited the former to visit their places and accept their hospitality. The Vedic Scholars of the upper worlds deemed it a great privilege to bestow on these marchers, the benefits, accrued by dint of their own Vedic rices and rituals. The Kinnaras and Garuḍas, famous as singers in their respective lands, also sang songs to greet the great marchers. May be that the Heaven-bound ‘Released souls’, pining whole-heartedly for the attainment of the Lord in Heaven, are bereft of any kind of desire for such entertainments. Nevertheless, the denizens of the respective order in the upper regions, would at once deem it their great privilege and duty to entertain these distinguished men, passing along.




## 10.9.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வேள்விஉள் மடுத்தலும் விரைகமழ் நறும்புகை  
காளங்கள் வலம்புரி கலந்துஎங்கும் இசைத்தனர்  
ஆள்மின்கள் வானகம் ஆழியான் தமர் என்று  
வாள்ஒண் கண்மடந்தையர் வாழ்த்தினர் மகிழ்ந்தே.

vēḷviuḷ maṭuttalum viraikamaḻ naṟumpukai

āḷmiṉkaḷ vāṉakam āḻiyāṉ tamar eṉṟu  
vāḷoṇ kaṇmaṭantaiyar vāḻttiṉar makiḻntē.

**English translation of verse 10.9.6:**

The fruits of their Vedic rites the savants did offer,  
The lovely smoke from the incense sweet spread all over;  
Chanks and bugles sounded lustily, the damsels, bright-eyed,  
Hailed the marchers, and unto them, in joyous accents, said,  
“Ye, devotees of our Lord Who does the discus wield.  
Sway over this country of ours may you hold.”

**Notes:**

The bright-eyed ‘Apsaras’, the sweet damsels in the upper regions, cast their cool glances on the Lord’s devotees, passing along; Overcome by spontaneous joy, these ladies welcomed the distinguished travellers with the same warmth with which the elders would greet the home-coming of an youngster who had strayed away in distant lands quite long. Nampiḷḷai would just melt down in ecstasy over the Lord’s redemptive grace which elevates even the erstwhile sinners, steeped in vice, to such a commanding position as to be adored by the rank and file of those in the top-most order of eminence.




## 10.9.7
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மடந்தையர் வாழ்த்தலும் மருதரும் வசுக்களும்  
தொடர்ந்து எங்கும் தோத்திரம் சொல்லினர் தொடுகடல்-  
கிடந்த எம்கேசவன் கிளர்ஒளி மணிமுடி  
குடந்தை எம்கோவலன் குடிஅடி யார்க்கே

maṭantaiyar vāḻttalum marutarum vacukkaḷum  
toṭarntu eṅkum tōttiram colliṉar toṭukaṭal-  
kiṭanta emkēcavaṉ kiḷaroḷi maṇimuṭi  
kuṭantai emkōvalaṉ kuṭiaṭi yārkkē

**English translation of verse 10.9.7:**

When the ladies sang the glory of these great marchers  
Who did from generations serve Kēcavaṉ, our Sire,  
Who did repose on the ocean unfathomable and now reclines  
In Kuṭantai sporting the gleaming gem-set crown,  
The ‘Marutars’ and ‘Vacus’ did their glory laud  
And kept following them as far as they could.

**Notes:**

\(i\) Not satisfied with what they did, in their respective areas, unto the distinguished marchers to Heaven, the ‘Maruth Gaṇas’ and ‘Aṣṭa Vasus’ went beyond their territorial limits, as far as they could, singing all the time the glory of these great souls on their upward journey. As a matter of fact, even these Devas, reputed for their rapid movements with immense speed, could not keep pace with the holy band on their heavenly ascent, as they were speeding fast towards the Lord in Heaven, Who would not brook separation from them, any longer.

\(ii\) The Heaven-bound Śrī Vaiṣṇavas are adored and revered by the people *en route*, as the hereditary vassals of the Lord, enshrined in Tirukkuṭantai (Kumbakōṇam in Tamil Nādu), the ‘Insatiable Nectar’. So great was Nammāḻvār’s fascination for this holy centre where the Lord reclines on the serpent-bed, out of loving condescension that he could not lift his mind off it, even at this crucial stage. Tirumaṅkai Āḻvār, who closely followed in the foot-steps of Nammāḻvār, also began and wound up his grand hymnals by referring to the holy Tirukkuṭantai.




## 10.9.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

குடிஅடியார் இவர் கோவிந்தன் தனக்குஎன்று  
முடிஉடை வானவர் முறைமுறை எதிர்கொள்ள  
கொடிஅணி நெடுமதிள் கோபுரம் குறுகினர்  
வடிவுஉடை மாதவன் வைகுந்தம் புகவே.

kuṭiaṭiyār ivar kōvintaṉ taṉakkueṉṟu  
muṭiuṭai vāṉavar muṟaimuṟai etirkoḷḷa  
koṭiaṇi neṭumatiḷ kōpuram kuṟukiṉar  
vaṭivuuṭai mātavaṉ vaikuntam pukavē.

**English translation of verse 10.9.8:**

The crowned denizens of Heaven spared no pains  
And came forward to welcome these devotees, from generations,  
Of Lord Kōvintaṉ, when they did the main entrance gain  
Of ‘Vaikuntam the abode of Mātavaṉ of form exquisite,  
Bound by stately walls which lovely banners decorate.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The ‘Nityas’, in Heaven, now come forward, in their strength, to greet the devotees from Earth, of Lord Govinda, who were enthralled by His amazing simplicity and loving condescension, during His advent on Earth. The venue where the two groups meet is just outside the main entrance to Heaven (Śrī Vaikuṇṭa). It may be noted that, while the previous song reflected the Lord’s glory in His ‘Arcā’ (iconic) manifestation, this song highlights the Lord’s trait of amazing simplicity, freely exhibited by Him during His ‘Vibhava’ (incarnate) state on Earth, the only place where this great trait of His could shine most.

\(ii\) The Lord (Śrīman Nārāyaṇa), ‘Nityas’ (Eternal Heroes) and ‘Muktas’ (Released Souls) are all decorated with crowns. But there is a difference; the Lord’s crown betokens His sovereignty, His role as the Protector of one and all, while the crowns of others are their badges of śeṣatva (servant-hood) or dedicated service unto the Lord.

\(iii\) The Heaven wears a festive look, with festoons and banners, hung across and lovely wall-decorations. Even the exceedingly charming Lord and the Divine Mother shine with special lustre, at the sight of these spiritually regenerated souls, reclaimed at long last. It is said that, when Vasudeva and Devakī saw Kṛṣṇa after Kaṃsa was slain, they looked years younger, overwhelmed with joy. King Daśaratha felt rejuvenated whenever he saw or thought of Rāma. Actually, the king gave expression to this sentiment, in the course of his lusty pleadings with the unrelenting Kaikeyi not to insist upon Rāma being sent into exile. (Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa 11.12.103).




## 10.9.9
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வைகுந்தம் புகுதலும் வாசலில் வானவர்  
வைகுந்தன் தமர்எமர் எமதுஇடம் புகுதஎன்று  
வைகுந்தத்து அமரரும் முனிவரும் வியந்தனர்  
வைகுந்தம் புகுவது மண்ணவர் விதியே.

vaikuntam pukutalum vācalil vāṉavar  
vaikuntaṉ tamaremar ematuiṭam pukutaeṉṟu  
vaikuntattu amararum muṉivarum viyantaṉar  
vaikuntam pukuvatu maṇṇavar vitiyē.

**English translation of verse 10.9.9:**

The eternal angels did in front of the gates of Heaven wait  
And with joy immense greeted these marchers great,  
Saying unto them, “May you, our masters, devotees of the Lord  
Of Vaikunta take over our duties and our positions hold”;  
The Celestials, in the perpetual service of the Lord engaged.  
And the sages, in meditation steeped, deemed it their privilege  
That men from Earth should go all the way to Heaven.

**Notes:**

Tirumaṅkai Āḻvār was so steeped in the enjoyment of the Lord in His Arcā (Iconic) manifestation in the ‘Līlā Vibhūthi’ (Sportive Universe), easily worshipped in His image form of exquisite charm, that he even ridiculed the idea of men aspiring for Heaven, like unto the senseless pursuit after the flying crow, letting go the rabbit on hand. And so, there lies the special charm in this abode of ours. It is this aspect that made the denizens in Heaven wonder how the men from Earth did at all go over to Heaven and if they did, it Was only due to the former’s great, good fortune. While this is how the Celestials, engaged in the perpetual service of the Lord in that heavenly setting, and the sages, absorbed in the contemplation of His innumerable auspicious traits, reacted to the entry into Heaven of the new-comers, the ‘Nityas’, the Eternal Angels, holding key positions in the governance over there, invited the newcomers to take their places straightaway. For example, senāpathi, the Premier Chamberlain to the Lord, would hand over his baton, the symbol of his vast authority, a gracious gesture indeed! This was because the new-comers were looked upon, by them al), as their very masters, the hot-favourites, the vassals of Vaikunṭanātha [Vaikuṇṭhanātha] (Lord of Heaven), in deep love with Him. These new-comers and the denizens, already in Heaven, thrive alike on divine service and it is this very service that is being offered now by the latter to the former.




## 10.9.10
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

விதிவகை புகுந்தனர்என்று நல்வேதியர்  
பதியினில் பாங்கினில் பாதங்கள் கழுவினர்  
நிதியும் நல்சுண்ணமும் நிறைகுட விளக்கமும்  
மதிமுக மடந்தையர் ஏந்தினர் வந்தே.

matimuka maṭantaiyar ēntiṉar vantē.

**English translation of verse 10.9.10:**

The eternal angels, by the sacred vedas adored, did deem  
It their fortune great that these men have to Heaven come,  
And so, they did receive them with honours great  
And with due ceremonies washed their feet;  
Came forward the damsels bright whose faces did like the moon shine,  
In their pretty hands, they held the Lord’s foot-rest fine,  
The vermilion powder which is on the devotees’ fore-heads worn,  
Vessels, full of water with coconut lids, and lamps auspicious.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The ‘Nitya Sūrīs’, the Eternal Angels, who never passed through the gruelling mill of Saṃsāra and are, therefore, known as⁴ aspriṣṭa Samsārīs’, honour the ‘Released Souls’ just entering Heaven on such a grand scale, without the slightest tinge of superiority complex. What makes them admire the new entrants and honour them, by enthroning them and washing their feet, is the fact that these men come from the land of dark nescience, affording very little scope for God-love and yet they are steeped in selfless love of God, too deep for words, and thus have an edge over the ‘Nityās’ themselves. If the ‘Nityās’ are pure and uncontaminated, it is by-no-means surprising for there is hardly any risk of contamination in Heaven, where they have been all along. On the other hand, it is indeed praiseworthy that those on Earth, situated as they are, should ever be able to turn their attention God-ward and, much less, love Him solely for His sake, with no strings attached.

\(ii\) The faces of the damsels in Heaven brighten up, all the more, due to sheer joy at the sight of these new-comers, like unto the jubilant mother, regaled by the home-coming of the way-Ward son who had strayed, for long, in distant lands.

**English translation of verse 10.9.11:**

Those that can recite these songs ten,  
Out of the thousand Veda-oriented songs of Caṭakōpaṉ  
Of Kurukūr, abounding in many a flower garden fine,  
Recounting his enjoyment in Heaven of beatific bliss eternal,  
In the company of the devotees great, in the gem-set hall,  
Greeted by the Lord Supreme and the Divine Mother,  
Will become sages, steeped in the Divine, for ever.

**Notes:**

\(i\) This end-song sets out the benefit, accruing to the chanters of this decad, as being their elevation on a par with the sages in the high Heaven, immersed in incessant contemplation of the auspicious attributes of the Lord.

\(ii\) Oh, what a glorious ascent! How exciting, exhilarating and entertaining is this special Heaven-bound route, exclusively earmarked for the ardent devotees of Lord Mahāviṣṇu! And there, at the other end, what a glorious reception by the Celestials, *en masse*, headed by their Chief, the Lord Himself, accompanied by the Divine Mother! And then, sitting in the grand gemset hall of Heaven, of incomparable excellence, in that august assembly, presided over by the Lord and the Divine Mother sharing His throne, is indeed the very acme of that inexhaustible bliss and beatitude.

Well, the Āḻvār has, at long last, achieved what he had pined for, all along, namely, the enjoyment of the Lord in Heaven, in the holy company of the great ones.

\(iii\) The Āḻvār has now entered the second stage, namely, ‘Para Jñāna’, in the ascending scale of God-love, which falls into the three distinct compartments of ‘Para Bhakti’, ‘Para Jñāna’ and ‘Parama Bhakti The first of these three stages became pronounced when the Supreme Lord, with lotus eyes, got into the Āḻvār’s eyes, (1-9-8) and thus blessed the Āḻvār with His glorious vision. This ‘Para Bhakti’ gathered momentum and got intensified to its farthest limit in X-8-7, where the Āḻvār referred to the Lord’s continuous stay in his full view, for his eyes to feast upon. The intensity of divine love, surging within, is such that it seeks to break its bounds and launch into external perception and enjoyment of the Lord, the grand vision, outstripping the narrow limits of mental comprehension (Darśana). And now, this glorious darśan, given expression to, by the Āḻvār, by way of referring to his blissful participation in the grand galaxy of the ‘Nityas’ and ‘Muktas’ in Heaven, the eternal land of inexhaustible bliss, marks the second stage of his Godlove, namely ‘Para Jñāna’, in full swing (vide aphorisms 230 and 231 of Ācārya Hṛdayam).

\(iv\) *The bliss eternal*: The eternal land (Heaven) is the abode of unalloyed bliss interminable, the diametrically opposite of Earth, the harrowing abode of endless misery and nothing but that. The so-called enjoyment, resorted to and indulged in, by the folks over here is nothing but misery under the cloak of enjoyment, pain in the garb of pleasure. When King Pāṇḍu aimed an arrow at a deer, the dying deer exclaimed: “A Rṣi that I am, my wife and I could snatch just a little time for sexual enjoyment and we disguised ourselves as deers, for this purpose. And this rare moment, one in a thousand, alas! You didn’t allow us to avail of. So, this is life!”
