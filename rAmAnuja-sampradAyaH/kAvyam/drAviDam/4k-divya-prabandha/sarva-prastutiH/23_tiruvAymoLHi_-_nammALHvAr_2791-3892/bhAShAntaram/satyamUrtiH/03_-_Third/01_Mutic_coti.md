## 00 Intro3.1
In the end-stanza of the preceding decad, the Āḻvār had referred to himself as one possessed of a clear vision, absolutely free from doubt and despair, discrepancies and deviations. But in the very next song, that is, the first song of this decad, he seeks clarification of certain doubts and thus betrays his ignorance. Well, ignorance is of four different kinds, namely (1) *Non-comprehension*. (2) *comprehension, halfway beset with doubts*, (3) *miscomprehension and* (4) *lapse of memory resulting in not remembering a thing previously known*. In the present case, the Āḻvār is assailed by doubts and yet, it transcends the above types of ignorance to which those still relatively unevolved and in the grip of nescience resulting from Karma, are susceptible. Here it is the bewitching splendour of Lord Aḻakar which defies description and baffles correct and complete comprehension. Enthralled by the charming personality of the Lord, the Āḻvār enquires of the Lord, “Sire, has the effulgence of your face expanded itself upwards into the dazzling crown and Your dazzling feet likewise expanded into the lotus seat on which they are poised?” It is the exuberance of their God-love, too deep for words, that throws the Āḻvārs into an ecstatic state of mental imbalance and this only redounds to their glory.

The Āḻvār who expounded the glory of Mount ‘Māliruñcōlai’ in the last decad, now proceeds to drink deep of the nectarean charm and enthralling beauty of Lord Aḻakar (The Beautiful), enshrined there.




## 3.1.1
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

முடிச்சோதியாய் உனது முகச் சோதி மலர்ந்ததுவோ,  
அடிச்சோதி நீநின்ற தாமரையாய் அலர்ந்ததுவோ,  
படிச்சோதி ஆடையொடும் பல் கலனாய், நின்பைம்பொன்  
கடிச்சோதி கலந்ததுவோ? திருமாலே! கட்டுரையே. (2)

muṭiccōtiyāy uṉatu mukac cōti malarntatuvō,  
aṭiccōti nīniṉṟa tāmaraiyāy alarntatuvō,  
paṭiccōti āṭaiyoṭum pal kalaṉāy, niṉpaimpoṉ  
kaṭiccōti kalantatuvō? tirumālē! kaṭṭuraiyē. (2)

**English translation of verse 3.1.1:**

May you clarify, oh, Tirumāl, if your crown aglow  
Is but the upward expansion of your facial glow,  
Your lotus seat, but the reflection of you- dazzling feet  
And the many jewels on Your person and silken garment,  
But the reflection of the glow on your waist radiant.

**Note**

The above poser of the Āḻvār is the result of his observation of the Lord’s bewitching chaim, in His iconic manifestation as Aḻakar, in conjunction with the jewels adorning Him, so well matched that the Āḻvār sees the crown as but an upward expansion of the effulgence on the Lord’s face. At the other end, the lotus seat on which the Lord’s feet are poised seems to be but a reflection of the effulgence on the Lord’s feet. Perhaps, there are no Jewels as such and the jewels that are seen are but a manifestation of the brilliant complexion of the Lord’s body and the flowing silken robe is, likewise, the reflection of the lustre around the Lord’s waist. In short, it is the Lord’s native charm and brilliance that pervade all round and give the beholder the impression that the Lord is bedecked with numerous Jewels and donning the silken robes. Even the ‘Nityās’, the ever-free angels in heaven, share this stunning experience with the Āḻvār who thus moves in good company. Indeed it is not too much to say that the Lord Himself is not aware of the precise extent of His charm and prowess.




## 3.1.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கட்டுரைக்கில் தாமரை நின் கண் பாதம் கை ஒவ்வா,  
சுட்டு உரைத்த நன்பொன் உன் திருமேனி ஒளி ஒவ்வாது,  
ஒட்டு உரைத்து இவ் உலகு உன்னைப் புகழ்வு எல்லாம் பெரும்பாலும்,  
பட்டுரையாய் புற்கு என்றே காட்டுமால் பரஞ்சோதீ!

kaṭṭuraikkil tāmarai niṉ kaṇ pātam kai ovvā,  
cuṭṭu uraitta naṉpoṉ uṉ tirumēṉi oḷi ovvātu,  
oṭṭu uraittu iv ulaku uṉṉaip pukaḻvu ellām perumpālum,  
paṭṭuraiyāy puṟku eṉṟē kāṭṭumāl parañcōtī!

**English translation of verse 3.1.2:**

My resplendent Lord, if one described your charm exquisite,  
The lotus flower will into your eyes, hands and feet,  
Bear no comparison, the lustrous gold cannot compete  
With your complexion grand and all the eulogy  
On you heaped by men of this world, on the analogy  
Of things worldly, will be mere words, insipid and foggy.

**Note**

The Lord’s exquisite charm can best be enjoyed only by drinking it in, with one’s eyes and mind. Words are but poor substitutes, and the comparisons, simiḷies and analogies indulged in by us, worldlings, are much too-feebḷe and faulty too, and cannot, therefore, describe the Lord’s exquisite features effectively.




## 3.1.3
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

பரஞ்சோதி! நீ பரமாய் நின் இகழ்ந்து பின், மற்று ஓர்  
பரம் சோதி இன்மையின் படி ஓவி நிகழ்கின்ற,  
பரஞ்சோதி நின்னுள்ளே படர் உலகம் படைத்த, எம்  
பரஞ்சோதி கோவிந்தா! பண்பு உரைக்கமாட்டேனே.

parañcōti! nī paramāy niṉ ikaḻntu piṉ, maṟṟu ōr  
param cōti iṉmaiyiṉ paṭi ōvi nikaḻkiṉṟa,  
parañcōti niṉṉuḷḷē paṭar ulakam paṭaitta, em  
parañcōti kōvintā! paṇpu uraikkamāṭṭēṉē.

**English translation of verse 3.1.3:**

Oh, Lord of splendour supreme, with none so resplendent,  
Comparison you transcend, by Your resolve radiant,  
You did the sprawling universe create,  
Oh, Kōvintā of rare brilliance, describe I can’t Your attributes.

**Note**

*Lord to the Alvār*: “Āḻvār, I agree that the worldlings cannot praise Me adequately. But you should be able to do full justice, having been endowed by Me with knowledge, full and flooding”.

*Alvār to the Lord*: “My Lord, none in any clime can make pretensions to your unrivalled splendour. Having, by a mere resolve, created the entire Universe, you are beyond the ken of comprehension of any one. At the same time, your *Saulabhya* (easy accessibility) is astounding. Even if one could find the summit of your transcendent glory, it is well nigh impossible to sound the depth of your amazing simplicity as Govinda (Kōvinta, in Tamil) and touch the floor space. The former can be talked about while it is pretty difficult even to ponder in one’s mind about the latter and much less talk about it”.




## 3.1.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மாட்டாதே ஆகிலும் இம் மலர் தலை மாஞாலம், நின்  
மாட்டு ஆய மலர்புரையும் திருவுருவம் மனம் வைக்க  
மாட்டாத பலசமய மதி கொடுத்தாய், மலர்த்துழாய்  
மாட்டேநீ மனம் வைத்தாய் மாஞாலம் வருந்தாதே?

māṭṭātē ākilum im malar talai māñālam, niṉ  
māṭṭu āya malarpuraiyum tiruvuruvam maṉam vaikka  
māṭṭāta palacamaya mati koṭuttāy, malarttuḻāy  
māṭṭēnī maṉam vaittāy māñālam varuntātē?

**English translation of verse 3.1.4:**

The sprawling world which did from your navel sprout,  
Thinks not your glory and your form exquisite  
(And worse still), many a religion is extant,  
Preaching heretical doctrines, the mind errant  
You gave them and yet if you are solely intent  
On enjoying the fragrance from your ṭuḷaci garland,  
Won’t it be a grievous loss for this world indeed?

**Notes**

\(i\) Brahmā, the demi-urge, emerged from the lotus stalk on the Lord’s navel and created all the worlds; hence the worlds are said to have come up from the Lord’s navel.

\(ii\) No doubt, in the preceding song, the Āḻvār confessed to his inability to describe the Lord’s attributes and yet it is Lord Aḻakar’s extraordinary beauty that eggs him on, to speak out his mind, deploring, at the same time, the aloofness of the world from the Lord, so sweet and exquisite. People have already no taste for Godhead and it is grievous enough. Further deterioration sets in, when diverse religions expound mutually contradictory and incompatible tenets and doctrines. The Āḻvār says that the Lord gave rise to all this hotch-potch in as much as He didn’t correct the minds of those going the wrong way. If, in a grievous situation like this, the Lord is complacent enough and his attention gets fixed on the sweet fragrance and freshness of His tuḷaci garland, instead of being harnessed to the reclamation of the errant Subject, there is indeed no hope of redemption for this world. This observation of the Āḻvār arises from his enjoyment of Lord Aḻakar’s exquisite beauty and the feeling of sorrow that the world around is unmindful of the Lord, so sweet and exquisite, because of the above factors. There is also the grand poetic imagery, the poet bringing out that Lord Aḻakar’s charm is so alluring that it ensnares Him as well and makes him oblivious of the imperative need to correct the world from going the wrong way under the unwholesome impact of heretical doctrines, propounded by perverts.




## 3.1.5
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வருந்தாத அரும்தவத்த மலர் கதிரின் சுடர் உடம்பு ஆய்,  
வருந்தாத ஞானம் ஆய் வரம்பு இன்றி முழுது இயன்றாய்,  
வரும் காலம் நிகழ் காலம் கழி காலம் ஆய், உலகை  
ஒருங்காக அளிப்பாய் சீர் எங்கு உலக்க ஓதுவனே?

varuntāta arumtavatta malar katiriṉ cuṭar uṭampu āy,  
varuntāta ñāṉam āy varampu iṉṟi muḻutu iyaṉṟāy,  
varum kālam nikaḻ kālam kaḻi kālam āy, ulakai  
oruṅkāka aḷippāy cīr eṅku ulakka ōtuvaṉē?

**English translation of verse 3.1.5:**

Your resplendent form you assume at your volition sweet,  
The result perhaps of your devotees’ penance great;  
Knowledge supreme is yours with no effort,  
Pervading without limits, the worlds you duly protect,  
Time is at your beck and call, past, present  
And future, how can I, your attributes fully relate?

**Note**

The preceding stanza (3-1-4) stands in isolation; in the midst of his enjoyment of Lord Aḻakar, the Āḻvār’s heart leapt towards the straying humanity and deplored their failure, rather their inability to feast on the exquisite charm of Aḻakar. This song has, therefore, to be studied in continuation of the third stanza where the Āḻvār had said” Oh, Kovindā, how can I describe your attributes?” The Lord rebuts the Āḻvār’s plea of inability, despite his supreme knowledge. Here then is the Āḻvār’s elucidation of his limitations, despite all that massive knowledge, dowered on him by the Lord whose glory, however, knows no bounds and cannot, therefore, be fully comprehended and expressed by any one. As a matter of fact, complete enumeration of the Lord’s glory, His auspicious traits etc, would be possible, only if they remained encompassed by known limits.




## 3.1.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஓதுவார் ஓத்து எல்லாம் எவ் உலகத்து எவ் எவையும்,  
சாதுவாய் நின் புகழின் தகை அல்லால் பிறிது இல்லை,  
போது வாழ் புனம் துழாய் முடியினாய், பூவின்மேல்  
மாது வாழ் மார்பினாய்! என் சொல்லி யான் வாழ்த்துவனே?

ōtuvār ōttu ellām ev ulakattu ev evaiyum,  
cātuvāy niṉ pukaḻiṉ takai allāl piṟitu illai,  
pōtu vāḻ puṉam tuḻāy muṭiyiṉāy, pūviṉmēl  
mātu vāḻ mārpiṉāy! eṉ colli yāṉ vāḻttuvaṉē?

**English translation of verse 3.1.6:**

My Lord, wearing on your crown tuḷaci garland,  
Set with *choice* flowers and holding on your lovely chest  
Mātu (Lakṣmī), the lotus-born! the scriptures and sacred texts.  
In the entire land, out to praise you, lag far behind,  
How indeed I can praise you occurs not to my mind.

**Note**

All the scriptures and sacred texts can only make an attempt to sing the Lord’s praise; none of these can, however, sing His glory, *in toto*. These praises are like unto the rain drops falling on the surface of the oceanic waters without, however, swelling them up. The faculty of speech dowered on us by the Lord is indeed put to proper use when we sing His glory, however poor our capacity may be. If the tongue is, however, put to any other use, it gets defiled like rain drops falling on mud becoming muddy, unlike those falling into the ocean remaining in tact.




## 3.1.7
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வாழ்த்துவார் பலர் ஆக நின்னுள்ளே நான்முகனை,  
மூழ்த்த நீர் உலகு எல்லாம் படை என்று முதல் படைத்தாய்  
கேழ்த்த சீர் அரன் முதலாக் கிளர் தெய்வமாய்க் கிளர்ந்து,  
சூழ்த்து அமரர் துதித்தால் உன் தொல் புகழ் மாசூணாதே?

vāḻttuvār palar āka niṉṉuḷḷē nāṉmukaṉai,  
mūḻtta nīr ulaku ellām paṭai eṉṟu mutal paṭaittāy  
kēḻtta cīr araṉ mutalāk kiḷar teyvamāyk kiḷarntu,  
cūḻttu amarar tutittāl uṉ tol pukaḻ mācūṇātē?

**English translation of verse 3.1.7:**

First and foremost, Nāṉmukaṉ (Brahmā) You did, by your resolve, raise  
And bade him create the worlds many, out of the deep waters;  
If Araṉ (Śiva) of prowess great and other devas who pose  
As the gods potent, your creatures all, were to sing your praise,  
Would it not your ancient glory efface?

**Note**

What does it matter how many sing the Lord’s glory and how powerful and knowledgeable they are? None can indeed be more articulate than the Vedas and even they can have only a sense of participation in a scheme of recital of the Lord’s glory, as distinguished from a sense of due fulfilment. Even the exalted Śiva, known for His extra ordinary wisdom, is no exception and fares no better. The measure of the Lord’s glory is as unlimited as the capacity of even the most knowledgeable of His subjects to sing His glory is miserably limited and pales into insignificance. Any attempt on their part to exhaustively sing His glory is thus an affront to His hoary fame.




## 3.1.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மாசூணாச் சுடர் உடம்புஆய் மலராது குவியாது,  
மாசூணா ஞானம் ஆய் முழுதும் ஆய் முழுது இயன்றாய்,  
மாசூணா வான் கோலத்து அமரர் கோன் வழிப்பட்டால்,  
மாசூணா உனபாத மலர்ச் சோதி மழுங்காதே?

mācūṇāc cuṭar uṭampuāy malarātu kuviyātu,  
mācūṇā ñāṉam āy muḻutum āy muḻutu iyaṉṟāy,  
mācūṇā vāṉ kōlattu amarar kōṉ vaḻippaṭṭāl,  
mācūṇā uṉapāta malarc cōti maḻuṅkātē?

**English translation of verse 3.1.8:**

Oh Lord of radiant person, immaculate!  
Your knowledge flawless, full and complete,  
Neither expands nor contracts,  
All things you control and in you they subsist;  
Wouldn’t the splendour diminish of your blemishless lotus feet  
Even if Brahmā, the impeccable chief sang your glory to his utmost?

**Note**

Even if Brahmā who is relatively superior to Śiva, attempted to sing the Lord’s glory, the result would be just the same.




## 3.1.9
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மழுங்காத வைந் நுதிய சக்கர நல் வலத்தையாய்,  
தொழும் காதல் களிறு அளிப்பான் புள் ஊர்ந்து தோன்றினையே,  
மழுங்காத ஞானமே படை ஆக மலர் உலகில்  
தொழும்பாயார்க்கு அளித்தால் உன் சுடர்ச் சோதி மறையாதே?

maḻuṅkāta vain nutiya cakkara nal valattaiyāy,  
toḻum kātal kaḷiṟu aḷippāṉ puḷ ūrntu tōṉṟiṉaiyē,  
maḻuṅkāta ñāṉamē paṭai āka malar ulakil  
toḻumpāyārkku aḷittāl uṉ cuṭarc cōti maṟaiyātē?

**English translation of verse 3.1.9:**

(It was but meet that) you went and rescued  
The elephant, passionately intent on worshipping you,  
Mounted on that bird (Garuḍa) and wielding the discus ever acute;  
(If instead), by mere resolve, ever alert, you did succour  
Your devotees in this wide world, all over,  
On your splendour great, it would indeed be a slur.

**Notes**

\(i\) The omnipotent Lord could, by a mere resolve, create this vast and wonderful universe. He can likewise achieve all things, by a mere resolve from His heavenly abode, without moving about. And then, He has such powerful weapons as the discus, ever sharp, which can be commissioned at any time, anywhere. And yet, when Gajendra the pious elephant, engaged in a titanic struggle with a crocodile, raised an alarum inviting the Lord’s help, the Lord rushed to the pond, mounted on Garuḍa, without merely commissioning the discus to do the job. In fact, He had no other option. The elephant entered the lotus pond, plucked a lotus flower to be offered to the Supreme Lord, Nārāyaṇa, and, in the process, got caught by a crocodile. In the long and grim struggle that ensued, the elephant got terribly emaciated and yet, his sole concern was to offer the flower to the Lord and hence, the alarum raised by him.

Unto the Lord who presented Himself before the elephant, the latter declared:

> “Oh, Slayer of Madhu, I was not in the least worried about this mortal
> frame, bound to decay some day, but my sole concern was to worship you
> and offer this lotus flower in my trunk (hand) at your golden feet”.

How can the aspiration of such an ardent devotee be fulfilled by the Lord, *in absentia*, by the mere exercise of His ‘*Saṅkalpa*’ (resolve) from where He is seated, like pressing a button afar, with all its mechanical efficiency? This brings us on to the purpose of the Lord’s Avatārs, main and secondary.

\(ii\) There are three components in the Lord’s motive behind His incarnations, viz,

\(i\) *Paritrāṇāya Sādhūnāṃ*—Sādhu paritrāṇaṃ or protection of the righteous;

\(ii\) *Vināśāya ca duṣkrtām*—Duṣṭa nigraha or vanquishing the evil-doers,

\(iii\) *Dharma Samstāpanārthāya*—resuscitation and establishment of dharma, (moral standards).

\(iii\) A little probe into this will reveal that (1) above, is the main purpose and that the other two are merely auxiliary thereto or the ingredients thereof. Even so, would it be necessary for the Lord to assume a special form and incarnate without merely contemplating, “May the righteous prosper and the evil forces die out?”

No, this won’t do, the Lord has to necessarily come down to meet the aspirations, the deep yearnings of the devout. What is, “*Sādhu paritrāṇam*’ after all? It is nothing but the fulfilment of the aspirations of the devout and the cutting out of things disliked by them. He cannot resist their deepest urges and inclinations, such as drinking in, with their naked eyes, the Lord’s nectarean beauty, an irresistible longing to embrace Him bodily and so on. It is during such contacts, that the Lord’s auspicious traits shine forth and it is only the contemplation of these traits, down the ages, long after He has gone back to the Celestium, that sustains the Sādhus (the devout), down to the present day and this, in essence, is the “*Sādhu paritrāṇaṃ*”.




## 3.1.10
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மறை ஆய நால் வேதத்துள் நின்ற மலர்ச் சுடரே,  
முறையால் இவ் உலகு எல்லாம் படைத்து இடந்து உண்டு உமிழ்ந்து அளந்தா,ய்  
பிறை ஏறு சடையானும் நான்முகனும் இந்திரனும்  
இறை ஆதல் அறிந்து ஏத்த வீற்றிருத்தல் இது வியப்பே?

maṟai āya nāl vētattuḷ niṉṟa malarc cuṭarē,

piṟai ēṟu caṭaiyāṉum nāṉmukaṉum intiraṉum  
iṟai ātal aṟintu ētta vīṟṟiruttal itu viyappē?

**English translation of verse 3.1.10:**

My lustrous Lord, enshrined you are in the Vedas four  
Which (unto aliens and heretics) reveal you not,  
The worlds you did create, picked them out from deep waters,  
Ate them up (during the deluge) and then spat them out,  
You spanned them too; seen thus as the Supreme Master,  
\|If you are worshipped by Śiva who does sport  
The crescent Moon on matted locks, Nāṉmukaṉ (Brahmā, the four-headed)  
And Intira, is it really any wonder indeed?

**Note**

Brahmā was created by the Lord and all the rest created by Brahmā. And then, it is the Lord who redeemed the worlds from underneath the Oceanic waters, sustained them inside His stomach during the period of deluge and put them back, in position, later on. He also spanned all the worlds in just three strides. It is, therefore, hardly any matter for wonder that His Supremacy is readily realised by those super-eminent personalities created by the Lord Himself, Brahmā, Śiva and Intira, and He is worshipped by them all. Nor can the Lord feel flattered by such worship by His own creatures, a mockery of worship, like unto a person setting his foot on the head of a doll of his, decorated by him and pompously declaring that the latter worshipped him.




## 3.1.11
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வியப்பாய வியப்புஇல்லா மெய்ஞ் ஞான வேதியனைச்,  
சயப்புகழார் பலர் வாழும் தடம் குருகூர்ச் சடகோபன்,  
துயக்கு இன்றித் தொழுது உரைத்த ஆயிரத்துள் இப்பத்தும்,  
உயக்கொண்டு பிறப்பு அறுக்கும் ஒலி முந்நீர் ஞாலத்தே.

**English translation of verse 3.1.11:**

This decad, out of the thousand, crystal-clear,  
Composed by Caṭakōpaṉ of Kurukūr, the mighty abode  
Of men of spiritual fame, in adoration of the Lord,  
By Vedas truly revealed, above all known wonders,  
Will from rebirth rid men of this world, bound by roaring waters.

**Notes**

\(i\) The Lord is a marvel unto Himself. What appears to be a matter of wonder for us, with limited intellect and meagre perception, is by-no-means wonderful for Him, who is the All-powerful Lord of the entire Universe. If some one presented to another as many as four cows at a time, it would indeed be a matter for surprise but if Lord Rāma gifted away thousands of cows to a poor brahmin (Tṛjaḍar) on the eve of setting out in exile, as we read in Chapter 32 of Ayodhyā Kāṇḍa of Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, it looks quite natural and there is nothing odd about it.

\(ii\) The chanters of this decad will get elevated from the bottom-most depths, as good as non-existent, to the highest heights.
