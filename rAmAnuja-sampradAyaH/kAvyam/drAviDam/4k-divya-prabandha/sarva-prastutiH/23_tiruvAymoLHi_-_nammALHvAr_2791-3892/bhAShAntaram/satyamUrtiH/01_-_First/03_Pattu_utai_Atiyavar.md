## 00 Intro1.3
In the first decad of this centum, the Āḻvār spoke of the Super-eminent glory of the Lord and, in the very next decad, he exhorted the worldlings to turn their minds God-ward and get absorbed in Him, with whole-hearted devotion. But then, they felt that they were no better than the man, lame of both hands, being required to mount an elephant. Now, in this decad, the Āḻvār puts them at ease by depicting the disarming simplicity of the Lord, like unto an elephant making itself so pliable as to enable even such a lame man to mount it easily. Speaking about the Supreme Lord’s easy accessibility (saulabhya), the Aḻvār at once conjures up the vision of His being tied down to a mere pounder, when He, as Kṛṣṇa, the cowherd boy, got caught in the act of stealing butter—the very antithesis of His transcendent glory as the consort of Śrī Mahā Lakṣmī, residing on His winsome chest. Oh, what a contrast and what an amazing simplicity, which literally struck the poet dumb, nay, sent him into a deep trance, lasting six months! Here is an episode of episodes, melting down the hearts of the true devotees into running rivulets. As Śrī Vedānta Dēśika says, in his rapturous composition ‘Yādavābhyudaya mere contemplation of this episode leads to our release from bondage.




## 1.3.1
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

பத்து உடை அடியவர்க்கு எளியவன்; பிறர்களுக்கு அரிய  
வித்தகன் மலர்மகள் விரும்பும் நம் அரும்பெறல் அடிகள்  
மத்து உறு கடை வெண்ணெய் களவினில் உரவிடை யாப்புண்டு  
எத்திறம், உரலினோடு இணைந்திருந்து ஏங்கிய எளியவே!

pattu uṭai aṭiyavarkku eḷiyavaṉ; piṟarkaḷukku ariya  
vittakaṉ malarmakaḷ virumpum nam arumpeṟal aṭikaḷ  
mattu uṟu kaṭai veṇṇey kaḷaviṉil uraviṭai yāppuṇṭu  
ettiṟam, uraliṉōṭu iṇaintiruntu ēṅkiya eḷiyavē!

**English translation of verse 1.3.1:**

Those who unto Him turn their minds, in utter devotion, He is easily accessible but is the Mystic, difficult of attainment by others. (Oh, what a wonder, as a mere infant, fondled by Yaśōdā and other damsels of Gōkul, he could vanquish the demoniac *Pūthanā*, *Śakaṭāśura* and a host of others!) Eagerly sought Malarmakaḷ (*Śrī Mahālakṣmī*), who emerged from the soft lotus flower and yet did not take to it kindly but took her abode on the broad and winsome chest of the Lord), what a marvel, our Lord, difficult to attain, was seen reduced to the abject position of a weeping child, fastened by the chest to a pounder (by *Yaśōdā*, as a punishment) for stealing butter off the churning rod—a paragon of simplicity galore!

**Note**

The Āḻvār is said to have gone into a trance for as many as six months, contemplating the amazing simplicity of the Supreme Lord, as brought out in this stanza.




## 1.3.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

எளிவரும் இயல்வினன் நிலை வரம்பு இல பல பிறப்பாய்  
ஒளிவரும் முழு நலம் முதல் இல கேடு இல வீடு ஆம்  
தெளிதரும் நிலைமையது ஒழிவு இலன் முழுவதும்; இறையோன்  
அளிவரும் அருளினோடு அகத்தனன் புறத்தனன் அமைந்தே.

eḷivarum iyalviṉaṉ nilai varampu ila pala piṟappāy  
oḷivarum muḻu nalam mutal ila kēṭu ila vīṭu ām  
teḷitarum nilaimaiyatu oḻivu ilaṉ muḻuvatum; iṟaiyōṉ  
aḷivarum aruḷiṉōṭu akattaṉaṉ puṟattaṉaṉ amaintē.

**English translation of verse 1.3.2:**

[Preamble:]—Tradition has it that Śrī Matura Kavi and several other savants, who had the great good fortune of listening to ‘Tiruvāymoḻi’ from the sacred lips of the Āḻvār, gathered round the insensate Āḻvār and eagerly awaited his return to his senses. It was after the lapse of a period of six months, that the Āḻvār recovered himself, took up the thread where he had left it and proceeded to expatiate on the Lord’s aforesaid ‘Saulabhya’ (easy accessibility) by saying that He is simplicity itself (simplicity personified).

**Translation**

The Lord is the very personification of simplicity, which helps all His numerous auspicious qualities, without beginning or end, shine forth; having made innumerable descents without restriction of manner of birth and place of descent, it is always the Lord’s prerogative to grant that cleansed and clarified state (known as ‘*Mokṣa*’). Shedding, with sweet spontaniety, His unlimited grace unto the devotees (and doing even odd jobs for them) He is beyond the reach of others (the inimical).




## 1.3.3
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அமைவு உடை அறநெறி முழுவதும் உயர்வு அற உயர்ந்து  
அமைவு உடை முதல் கெடல் ஒடிவு இடை அற நிலம் அது ஆம்  
அமைவு உடை அமரரும் யாவையும் யாவரும் தான் ஆம்  
அமைவு உடை நாரணன் மாயையை அறிபவர் யாரே?

amaivu uṭai aṟaneṟi muḻuvatum uyarvu aṟa uyarntu  
amaivu uṭai mutal keṭal oṭivu iṭai aṟa nilam atu ām  
amaivu uṭai amararum yāvaiyum yāvarum tāṉ ām  
amaivu uṭai nāraṇaṉ māyaiyai aṟipavar yārē?

**English translation of verse 1.3.3:**

Who indeed can comprehend the wonderful secret of the descents (*Avatāras*) of (Lord) Nāraṇaṉ, the appropriate abode of all sentient beings including the ‘Amaras’ (the exalted Brahmā and other celestials) of outstanding eminence by virtue of their moral attainments of a high degree and mental perfection, as well as the non-sentient things?

**Note**

None can indeed comprehend this divine secret, neither the ever-free, eternal angels (*Nitya Sūrīs*) in the yonder Heaven, totally immersed in the enjoyment of the Lord, in that transcendent setting nor the worldlings, engrossed in their pursuit after food and raiment nor even the *Āḻvārs*, although blest by the Lord with perfect knowledge, as they just get entranced by the mere contemplation of the Lord’s astounding simplicity and thaw down.




## 1.3.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

யாரும் ஓர் நிலைமையன் என அறிவு அரிய எம் பெருமான்  
யாரும் ஓர் நிலைமையன் என அறிவு எளிய எம் பெருமான்  
பேரும் ஓர் ஆயிரம் பிறபல உடைய எம் பெருமான்  
பேரும் ஓர் உருவமும் உளது இல்லை இலது இல்லை பிணக்கே.

yārum ōr nilaimaiyaṉ eṉa aṟivu ariya em perumāṉ  
yārum ōr nilaimaiyaṉ eṉa aṟivu eḷiya em perumāṉ  
pērum ōr āyiram piṟapala uṭaiya em perumāṉ  
pērum ōr uruvamum uḷatu illai ilatu illai piṇakkē.

**English translation of verse 1.3.4:**

Our Sire, bearing a thousand (innumerable) names and (the) forms (appropriate thereto) can be comprehended, as such, (by the devotees, however meagre, their intelect and poor, their parentage); (on the other hand) the ungodly who bear no love for Him cannot comprehend His names and forms (however exalted be their knowledge and parentage); (And so), there is a perennial debate (between these two sets of people) one group affirming that the Lord goes by several names and forms and the other group asserting that He has none of these.




## 1.3.5
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

பிணக்கற அறுவகைச் சமயமும் நெறி உள்ளி உரைத்த  
கணக்கு அறு நலத்தனன் அந்தம் இல் ஆதி அம் பகவன்  
வணக்கு உடைத் தவநெறி வழிநின்று புறநெறி களைகட்டு  
உணக்குமின், பசை அற! அவனுடை உணர்வுகொண்டு உணர்ந்தே.

piṇakkaṟa aṟuvakaic camayamum neṟi uḷḷi uraitta  
kaṇakku aṟu nalattaṉaṉ antam il āti am pakavaṉ  
vaṇakku uṭait tavaneṟi vaḻiniṉṟu puṟaneṟi kaḷaikaṭṭu  
uṇakkumiṉ, pacai aṟa! avaṉuṭai uṇarvukoṇṭu uṇarntē.

**English translation of verse 1.3.5:**

The eternal Lord, the lovely Primate possessing the Six principal attributes of *knowledge, strength, sovereignty, valour, power* and *splendour*) has set at naught the *six heretical philosophical doctrines* (*Śāṅkhya, Yoga, Kaṇāta [Kaṇada], Bouddha (Bauddha), Jaina* and *Pāśupada*) by setting forth the cream of the Vedic teachings in His ‘Song celestial’ (*Gītā*). Imbibing the quintessence of those teachings, stick to the path of loving surrender to His Sweet grace (*Prapatti mārgā*) to the exclusion of all the other paths of discipline, drying up, at the same time, the erstwhile springs of bodily pleasures *in toto* (not merely through non-indulgence in them but through a positive aversion thereto).

**Note**

As regards the concrete manner of worshipping the Supreme Lord, the Āḻvār, calls upon the fellow beings to tread the path of ‘Bhakti’ (God-love of melting tenderness of heart) indicated by the Lord Himself in His ‘Song Celestial’.




## 1.3.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

உணர்ந்து உணர்ந்து இழிந்து அகன்று உயர்ந்து உரு வியந்த இந் நிலைமை  
உணர்ந்து உணர்ந்து உணரிலும் இறைநிலை உணர்வு அரிது உயிர்காள்!  
உணர்ந்து உணர்ந்து உரைத்து உரைத்து அரி அயன் அரன் என்னும் இவரை  
உணர்ந்து உணர்ந்து உரைத்து உரைத்து இறைஞ்சுமின் மனப்பட்டது ஒன்றே.

uṇarntu uṇarntu iḻintu akaṉṟu uyarntu uru viyanta in nilaimai  
uṇarntu uṇarntu uṇarilum iṟainilai uṇarvu aritu uyirkāḷ!  
uṇarntu uṇarntu uraittu uraittu ari ayaṉ araṉ eṉṉum ivarai  
uṇarntu uṇarntu uraittu uraittu iṟaiñcumiṉ maṉappaṭṭatu oṉṟē.

**English translation of verse 1.3.6:**

[Preamble:]—*Worldlings to the Āḻvār*: “Oh, Saint, to us with limited knowledge, the Trinity, standing in a row, *Brahmā, Viṣṇu* and *Rudra*, appear to be all of the same stature. Pray, enlighten us, as to whether it is actually so or one of them is Superior to the other two or there is yet another Power superior to all the three, so that we may worship that Supreme Authority”.

The Āḻvār’s reply is as in this stanza, vide gist given below:

**Translation**

“For the *Jīvātmā* (individual Soul, with its innate intelligence and keen perception pervading far and wide), it is possible to know its own inherent nature and quality through a rigorous process of enquiry, intuition and contemplation. But a similar perception by the Individual Soul, of Iṟainilai (the Divine Nature, Īśvara Svarūpa) is hardly possible. (And yet) ye folks, better study intensely and dispassionately (the authoritative texts highlighting) the individual traits and course of conduct of *Ari* (Nārāyaṇa, *Ayaṉ* (Brahmā) and *Araṉ* (Rudra) and (in the process) fix your mind firmly on the one who impresses you as the Supreme Lord and worship Him (by reciting His names and the relative Mantras) with deep devotion. (Such a study will easily reveal that *Nārāyaṇa* is the Supreme, the Internal Controller of all, including *Brahmā* and *Rudra*, that He is wholly ‘*Sātvik*’ while *Brahmā* and *Rudra* have a blend of ‘*Rājasik*’ and ‘*tāmasik*’ traits, He is the great Ordainer and the others are the ordained, so on and so forth).




## 1.3.7
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஒன்று எனப் பல என அறிவு அரும்வடிவினுள் நின்ற  
நன்று எழில் நாரணன் நான்முகன் அரன் என்னும் இவரை  
ஒன்ற நும் மனத்து வைத்து உள்ளி நும் இரு பசை அறுத்து  
நன்று என நலம் செய்வது அவனிடை நம்முடை நாளே.

oṉṟu eṉap pala eṉa aṟivu arumvaṭiviṉuḷ niṉṟa  
naṉṟu eḻil nāraṇaṉ nāṉmukaṉ araṉ eṉṉum ivarai  
oṉṟa num maṉattu vaittu uḷḷi num iru pacai aṟuttu  
naṉṟu eṉa nalam ceyvatu avaṉiṭai nammuṭai nāḷē.

**English translation of verse 1.3.7:**

May you ponder in your mind, dispassionately, over the relative merits of the Gods. Nāraṇaṉ beaming through His auspicious attributes, firm and fine, Nāṉmukaṉ (the four-headed *Brahmā*) and *Araṉ* (*Rudra*), who look so much alike that it is difficult to comprehend whether they are one or many; may you also investigate (with the help of authoritative texts) and discern that there is but one God (and that is *Nārāyaṇa*, the Super-Soul residing in all, including *Brahmā* and *Rudra*); with this discovery you will do well to give up your allegiance to the other two (Brahmā and *Rudra*) as God and attach yourselves firmly to *Nārāyaṇa* (as the one and only God) during your life-time.




## 1.3.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நாளும் நின்று அடு நம பழமை அம் கொடுவினை உடனே  
மாளும் ஓர் குறைவு இல்லை; மனன் அகம் மலம் அறக் கழுவி  
நாளும் நம் திரு உடை அடிகள் தம் நலம் கழல் வணங்கி  
மாளும் ஓர் இடத்திலும் வணக்கொடு மாள்வது வலமே.

nāḷum niṉṟu aṭu nama paḻamai am koṭuviṉai uṭaṉē  
māḷum ōr kuṟaivu illai; maṉaṉ akam malam aṟak kaḻuvi  
nāḷum nam tiru uṭai aṭikaḷ tam nalam kaḻal vaṇaṅki  
māḷum ōr iṭattilum vaṇakkoṭu māḷvatu valamē.

**English translation of verse 1.3.8:**

If we cleanse our minds of the dirt (of misconceived notion of parity among the ‘*Thiru-Murties*’, *Brahmā*, *Viṣṇu* and *Śiva*) through that bleaching agent, called wisdom, and worship daily at the felicitous feet of our Lord, the gracious consort of *Tiru (Śrī Mahālakṣmī*), all our past sins which had been tormenting us so far will die out at once, and we will be free from wants of any kind. (It is never too late to switch on to the Lord thus.) better repose on His lap, even while dying.

**Notes**

\(i\) To a question supposed to have been put to the Āḻvār by his interlocutors, whether their accumulated, age-long sins will not operate as a serious impediment to their worshipping the Lord, this stanza provides the answer. No doubt, the Śāstras proclaim.[^1] that one cannot but taste the fruits of one’s actions; in other words, the sins can be liquidated only by the compulsory process of undergoing the prescribed sufferings. That is all right, so far as the potentiality of the reactions of one’s own past Karma goes. But that can be no bar to the operation of the Lord’s mighty grace, full and flooding, washing away all sins the moment one surrenders to Him, in the gracious presence of Mahālakṣmī, the Divine Mother. If past Karma is like the fire that burns out things, the Lord’s grace is like the water that puts out fire.

[^1]:  ‘nābhuktaṃ kṣayate karma’.

\(ii\) Again, assuming that the worldlings further pleaded that time has run out already, and they have very little time left in the present span, the Aḷvār says that it is never too late; even if a decrepit old man dies, leaning forward on bis stick, the Lord will be gracious enough to take it as an act of obeisance to Him. The Aḷvār stresses that it is better to bow unto Him, at least during the last moments of one’s life, unlike Rāvaṇa whose creed was[^2] not to bow unto any one till his death, and even while dying.

[^2]:  ‘na nameyam tu kasyacit’.






## 1.3.9
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வலத்தனன் திரிபுரம் எரித்தவன், இடம்பெறத் துந்தித்  
தலத்து எழு திசைமுகன் படைத்த நல் உலகமும் தானும்  
புலப்பட பின்னும் தன் உலகத்தில் அகத்தனன் தானே  
சொலப் புகில் இவை பின்னும் வயிற்று உள; இவை அவன் துயக்கே.

valattaṉaṉ tiripuram erittavaṉ, iṭampeṟat tuntit  
talattu eḻu ticaimukaṉ paṭaitta nal ulakamum tāṉum  
pulappaṭa piṉṉum taṉ ulakattil akattaṉaṉ tāṉē  
colap pukil ivai piṉṉum vayiṟṟu uḷa; ivai avaṉ tuyakkē.

**English translation of verse 1.3.9:**

His (Lord Mahā Viṣṇu’s) navel is the seat of *Ticai mukaṉ* (Brahmā), the creator of many a lovely world, while (*Rudra*) the (Ostensible) destroyer of the three (flying) citadels (and their demoniac chiefs) propitiates the Lord and gets allotted some space to the right, on His (the Lord’s) broad, winsome chest (as a place of shelter, in any emergency). He (The Lord) also makes Himself visible to one and all, in the respective worlds (during *His Āvatāras*).

In a manner of talking, these (great qualities of the Lord are innumerable, but) arc kept in His stomach (undisclosed, far outnumbering those disclosed to us already); these are His enigmatic ways indeed.




## 1.3.10
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

துயக்கு அறு மதியில் நல் ஞானத்துள் அமரரைத் துயக்கும்  
மயக்கு உடை மாயைகள் வானிலும் பெரியன வல்லன்  
புயல் கரு நிறத்தனன்; பெரு நிலங் கடந்த நல் அடிப் போது  
அயர்ப்பிலன் அலற்றுவன் தழுவுவன் வணங்குவன் அமர்ந்தே.

tuyakku aṟu matiyil nal ñāṉattuḷ amararait tuyakkum  
mayakku uṭai māyaikaḷ vāṉilum periyaṉa vallaṉ  
puyal karu niṟattaṉaṉ; peru nilaṅ kaṭanta nal aṭip pōtu  
ayarppilaṉ alaṟṟuvaṉ taḻuvuvaṉ vaṇaṅkuvaṉ amarntē.

**English translation of verse 1.3.10:**

If aberrations are noticeable (now and then) in the mental attitudes of even those Amarars (*Celestials*) noted for clarity of knowledge and understanding) (like *Indra* and the ‘Nitya Sūrīs’, the ever free angels like *Garuḍa*), towards the supreme Lord, that is because the wonders (of His incarnation) exceed the bounds of the expansive sky and thus (easily) baffle them all. (Be that, as it may) I (on my part) shall unremittingly bow before the lovely feet of the cloud-hued Lord, which spanned the entire universe, embrace and extol them, with a mind wholly detached from all else.

**Notes**

\(i\) Speaking about the mental aberrations of even those exalted personages, here are two typical anecdotes: There was a time when the Devas were uprooted from their homes and their women folks were kidnapped by the Asuras. During His Avatāra, as Lord Kṛṣṇa, the Lord fought out the demons and restored the home and hearth to the Devas. While returning from that expedition, Śrī Kṛṣṇa took with Him a flower plant, plucked out from Indra’s garden, to be planted in His palace down below. The ungrateful Indra would, however, not tolerate it and, armed with his mace, he went in hot pursuit of the Lord to snatch the plant from Him.

\(ii\) And then, during the same Kṛṣṇāvatāra, Garuḍā came down to Earth in pursuit of a snake which, however, sought asylum in Lord Kṛṣṇa. Naturally, the Lord refused to release the snake when demanded by *Garuḍa*, and the latter made no secret of his resentment and uttered such harsh words as: “Is this the reward for my having carried you and your consorts on my shoulders all these years?”




## 1.3.11
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அமரர்கள் தொழுது எழ அலை கடல் கடைந்தவன் தன்னை  
அமர் பொழில் வளங் குருகூர்ச் சடகோபன் குற்றேவல்கள்  
அமர் சுவை ஆயிரத்து அவற்றினுள் இவை பத்தும் வல்லார்  
அமரரோடு உயர்வில் சென்று அறுவர் தம் பிறவி அம் சிறையே.

amararkaḷ toḻutu eḻa alai kaṭal kaṭaintavaṉ taṉṉai

amararōṭu uyarvil ceṉṟu aṟuvar tam piṟavi am ciṟaiyē.

**English translation of verse 1.3.11:**

Those that are conversant with these ten songs, out of the thousand sung sweetly, as a piece of Divine Service, by Caṭakōpaṉ of Kurukūr, rich and resourceful, in adoration of the one (Supreme Lord) that churned the milk-ocean with its surging waves, exciting the warm admiration and deep reverence of the (otherwise self-centred) *Amarars* (*Devas*) will get released from the firm and formidable grip of (the cycle of) births and join the holy band of the *Amarars* (the celestials) in the High Heavens.
