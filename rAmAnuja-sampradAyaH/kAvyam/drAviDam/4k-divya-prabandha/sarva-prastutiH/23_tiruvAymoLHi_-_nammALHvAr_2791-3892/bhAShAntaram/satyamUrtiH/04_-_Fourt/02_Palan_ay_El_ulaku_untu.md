## 00 Intro4.2
In the eighth decad of the third centum, the Āḻvār and his sense-organs intensely longed for the enjoyment of Ged, in a spirit of competitive exuberance. In the three succeeding decads, this God-hunger was temporarily displaced, partly by the Āḻvār’s preoccupation with his fellow-beings and partly by his joyous recounting of the various benefits conferred on him by the bounteous Lord. And now, in this decad, the Āḻvār’s God-hunger has lifted up its head once again, the recoiling, as it were, of the Āḻvār’s advice to the worḻdlingson the Āḻvār himself. Well, this is precisely what happened when Vibhīṣaṇa advised Rāvaṇa. Vibhīṣaṇa’s advice, as we all know, fell on deaf eats but, at the same time, it led to Vibhīṣaṇa himself getting into Śrī Rāma’s camp. And then, take the case of Prahlāda. The little lad's advice to an unresponsive and uncompromising fiend of a father (Hiṟaṇya) only tended to enrich the former’s God-love. The Āḻvār’s God-love having been excited, he longs for the Lord’s vision, as during His Avatāras, in the days gone-by. So deep is his longing that the frustration resulting from its non-fulfilment renders the Āḻvār insensate, like a female forsaken by her lover after their erstwhile union. The mother steps in, once again, to describe the critical condition of her daughter, the Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī.

It is worth recalling, in this context, how Bhīmasena prayed to Hanumān, when the former met the latter several thousands of years after Śrī Rāma had gone back to the Celestium, that Hanumān be pleased to exhibit the gigantic form he had assumed while flying across the ocean to get into Laṅkā. Well, Bhīmasena was nor that ludicrous sort to ask for the impossible. Actually, he was well aware cf. Hanumān’s great prowess and his ability to meet the demand in question. Likewise, the Āḻvār was also quite conscious of the Lord’s capacity to take him through back periods, cutting across even the proverbially irretrievable past. This knowledge of the Āḻvār, coupled with his irrepressible longing to enjoy the Lord’s past Avatāras, could very well form the background for this decad.




## 4.2.1
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

பாலன் ஆய் ஏழ் உலகு உண்டு பரிவு இன்றி,  
ஆல் இலை அன்னவசம் செய்யும் அண்ணலார்,  
தாள் இணைமேல் அணி தண் அம் துழாய் என்றே  
மாலுமால், வல்வினையேன் மட வல்லியே. (2)

pālaṉ āy ēḻ ulaku uṇṭu parivu iṉṟi,  
āl ilai aṉṉavacam ceyyum aṇṇalār,  
tāḷ iṇaimēl aṇi taṇ am tuḻāy eṉṟē  
mālumāl, valviṉaiyēṉ maṭa valliyē. (2)

**English translation of verse 4.2.1:**

Alas! this fell sinner’s tender daughter, like unto a creeper young  
Is madly in love with the Lord and keeps pining  
For the tuḷaci garland, cool and nice, on His feet worn,  
When He, as a babe, held in His stomach, the worlds seven,  
With no effort, reposing on a fig-leaf thin.

**Note**

“It is amazing”, the Mother exclaims, “that my daughter should pine, at this distance of time, for the tuḷaci garland worn on the Lord’s feet when He contained, in His stomach, all the worlds and reposed, as a tender babe, on a fig-leaf, floating on the vast expanse of water. Had the Lord gulped down the worlds as an adult, it might not agitate my daughter’s mind so much. She is indeed worried that He should have done it, as a mere babe, even as children are generally prone to gulp down the mouth whatever comes handy. And then, I can understand her mouth constantly uttering the words, tuḷaci, cool and lovely, at the feet of the Lord’ confounded that she is with deep love but she longs to have it, right now. If a person comprehends as fire the lustre shed by a gem, should the heat of this imaginary fire be also felt? How strange is my daughter’s stance indeed!”




## 4.2.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வல்லி சேர் நுண் இடை ஆய்ச்சியர் தம்மொடும்,  
கொல்லைமை செய்து குரவை பிணைந்தவர்,  
நல் அடிமேல் அணி நாறு துழாய் என்றே  
சொல்லுமால், சூழ் வினையாட்டியேன் பாவையே.

valli cēr nuṇ iṭai āycciyar tammoṭum,  
kollaimai ceytu kuravai piṇaintavar,  
nal aṭimēl aṇi nāṟu tuḻāy eṉṟē  
collumāl, cūḻ viṉaiyāṭṭiyēṉ pāvaiyē.

**English translation of verse 4.2.2:**

Ha! the statuesque daughter of this sinner dire  
Always pines for the tuḷaci fragrant, worn on the lovely feet  
Of the Lord who (as Kṛṣṇa) did around Him gather  
The thin-waisted shepherdesses and on them unleash  
Many a wily prank and with them merrily danced.

**Note**

It was a glorious night, the night of nights, when the classical dance, known as ‘Rāsa Krīḍā’, in Sanskrit and ‘Kuravai’, in Tamil, took place in Vrindāvan. Śrī Kṛṣṇa, assuming several forms, enchanting beyond description, danced in between one Gopi and another, His hands being locked up with theirs. Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī now pines for the fragrant tuḷaci worn by the Lord on His feet at that time, being a legitimate aspirant, comparable to the Gopis in question. Perhaps, the gnostic mother had pointed out to the Nāyakī that her pining for the tuḷaci garland worn by the Lord during the great deluge as a measure of universal protection, in a remote past, was not merely out of date but also out of place.




## 4.2.3
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

பா இயல் வேத நல் மாலை பல கொண்டு,  
தேவர்கள் மா முனிவர் இறைஞ்ச நின்ற  
சேவடிமேல் அணி செம் பொன் துழாய் என்றே  
கூவுமால், கோள் வினையாட்டியேன் கோதையே.

pā iyal vēta nal mālai pala koṇṭu,  
tēvarkaḷ mā muṉivar iṟaiñca niṉṟa  
cēvaṭimēl aṇi cem poṉ tuḻāy eṉṟē  
kūvumāl, kōḷ viṉaiyāṭṭiyēṉ kōtaiyē.

**English translation of verse 4.2.3:**

This dire sinner’s daughter, with locks lovely,  
Pines for the pretty tuḷaci, like red-gold, at the Lord’s feet comely,  
(That spanned the worlds), adored by Devas and Sages great,  
Chanting the Vedas, set in metres appropriate.  
Like unto many a garland exquisite.

**Note**

The Nāyakī covets the tuḷaci, worn at the feet of the Lord, when He spanned the Universe long, long ago and the great Sages and Devas worshipped Him with beautiful garlands, namely, the sweet metrical compositions of the Vedas. The Mother is indeed surprised that her lovely daughter of ravishing beauty, the garland coveted by the Lord Hīmself, should cover yet another garland.




## 4.2.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கோது இல வண்புகழ் கொண்டு சமயிகள்,  
பேதங்கள் சொல்லிப் பிதற்றும் பிரான்பரன்,  
பாதங்கள் மேல் அணி பைம் பொன் துழாய் என்றே  
ஓதுமால், ஊழ்வினையேன் தடந் தோளியே.

kōtu ila vaṇpukaḻ koṇṭu camayikaḷ,  
pētaṅkaḷ collip pitaṟṟum pirāṉparaṉ,  
pātaṅkaḷ mēl aṇi paim poṉ tuḻāy eṉṟē  
ōtumāl, ūḻviṉaiyēṉ taṭan tōḷiyē.

**English translation of verse 4.2.4:**

Ha! this terrific sinner’s daughter, with shoulders fair,  
Craves for the tuḷaci, pretty like Gold, fresh and pure,  
That decorates the feet of the Supreme Lord in heaven.  
Whose traits flawless are debated upon  
By the votaries over there with great fascination.

**Notes**

\(i\) The debate by the distinguished denizens of Heaven arises from the fact that one section feels attracted by the Lord’s transcendent glory (Paratva) while another is drawn towards His ‘Saulabhya’, simplicity galore. Each section adores the Lord from its own angle. A trait is said to be flawless only when the person who contemplates it is wholly immersed in it without being led on to any other trait. The Lord’s traits are flawless in the sense that each one of them is of unlimited dimensions and one can get immersed in, rather, rivetted to it, for all time.

\(ii\) The mother having pointed out that the Lord’s incarnate forms belonged to the irretrievable past, like the rivers, once in spate, having gone dry, the Nāyaki would be satisfied if she could at least get hold of the tuḷaci garland from the Lord, in His transcendental abode.




## 4.2.5
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

தோளி சேர் பின்னை பொருட்டு எருது ஏழ் தழீஇக்  
கோளியார் கோவலனார் குடக் கூத்தனார்,  
தாள் இணைமேல் அணி தண் அம் துழாய் என்றே  
நாளும்நாள், நைகின்றதால் என்தன் மாதரே

tōḷi cēr piṉṉai poruṭṭu erutu ēḻ taḻīik  
kōḷiyār kōvalaṉār kuṭak kūttaṉār,  
tāḷ iṇaimēl aṇi taṇ am tuḻāy eṉṟē  
nāḷumnāḷ, naikiṉṟatāl eṉtaṉ mātarē

**English translation of verse 4.2.5:**

Alas! day by day, my daughter keeps withering down,  
Pining for the tuḷaci, cool and lovely, on His feet worn  
By Kōvalaṉ, the Pot-dancer, who pounced upon the bulls seven,  
To win the hand of Piṉṉai, the pretty bride, with shoulders fine.

**Note**

Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī is said to be withering away, in contemplation of the tuḷaci worn by Kōvalaṉ (Gopāla Kṛṣṇa) when He tamed the seven unruly bulls to secure the hand of Nappiṉṉai, the charming niece of Queen Yaśodhā. If the gnostic mother could not get for the Nāyakī, the tuḷaci garland worn by the Lord in the heavenly abode, she would want to know why she cannot have the tuḷaci from the feet of Śrī Kṛṣṇa who encountered the seven unruly bulls for the sake of one like her.




## 4.2.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மாதர் மா மண்மடந்தைபொருட்டு ஏனம் ஆய்,  
ஆதி அம் காலத்து அகல் இடம் கீண்டவர்,  
பாதங்கள்மேல் அணி பைம் பொன் துழாய் என்றே  
ஓதுமால், எய்தினள் என் தன் மடந்தையே.

mātar mā maṇmaṭantaiporuṭṭu ēṉam āy,  
āti am kālattu akal iṭam kīṇṭavar,  
pātaṅkaḷmēl aṇi paim poṉ tuḻāy eṉṟē  
ōtumāl, eytiṉaḷ eṉ taṉ maṭantaiyē.

**English translation of verse 4.2.6:**

My young daughter stands entranced by the tuḷaci, superfine.  
Which did the lovely feet of the Great Boar adorn,  
Who the Earth pulled out in a distant past,  
From deep waters to placate Mother Earth of charm exquisite.

**Note**

The Mother says that her daughter goes into raptures over the tuḷaci worn at the feet of the Lord who assumed even the form of a beast and reclaimed the earth from beneath the deep waters for the sake of just another lady, namely, Dame Earth.




## 4.2.7
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மடந்தையை வண் கமலத் திருமாதினை,  
தடம் கொள் தார் மார்பினில் வைத்தவர் தாளின்மேல்,  
வடம் கொள் பூம் தண் அம் துழாய்மலர்க்கே இவள்  
மடங்குமால் வாள் நுதலீர்!! என் மடக்கொம்பே.

maṭantaiyai vaṇ kamalat tirumātiṉai,  
taṭam koḷ tār mārpiṉil vaittavar tāḷiṉmēl,  
vaṭam koḷ pūm taṇ am tuḻāymalarkkē ivaḷ  
maṭaṅkumāl vāḷ nutalīr!! eṉ maṭakkompē.

**English translation of verse 4.2.7:**

Ye, damsels with foreheads bright! here’s my daughter,  
Like unto the creeper young, madly after  
The tuḷaci garland, cool and lovely, closely knit,  
At the feet of the Lord who lodged on His broad chest,  
With garland, bedecked (Lakṣmī), the lotus-born,  
The lady, young and lovely (when He did the ocean chum).

**Note**

Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī’s mind leaps back to the churning of the Milk-ocean, when Lakṣmī emerged and got herself lodged on the Lord’s chest. Following the usual pattern, the Nāyakī is after the tuḷaci worn by the Lord on His feet at that time.




## 4.2.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கொம்பு போல் சீதைபொருட்டு இலங்கை நகர்  
அம்பு எரி உய்த்தவர் தாள் இணைமேல் அணி,  
வம்பு அவிழ் தண் அம் துழாய் மலர்க்கே இவள்-  
நம்புமால், நான் இதற்கு என்செய்கேன் நங்கைமீர்!

kompu pōl cītaiporuṭṭu ilaṅkai nakar  
ampu eri uyttavar tāḷ iṇaimēl aṇi,  
vampu aviḻ taṇ am tuḻāy malarkkē ivaḷ-  
nampumāl, nāṉ itaṟku eṉceykēṉ naṅkaimīr!

**English translation of verse 4.2.8:**

Ye, young ladies, what can I do for my daughter  
Who does for the fragrant tuḷaci, cool and lovely, aspire,  
Worn at the feet of Rāma whose arrows spat fire  
On Laṅkā to reclaim Cītai, like unto the comely creeper?

**Note**

The creeper is but a part of the tree and Sītā, the lovely creeper is thus part of the tree, namely, Rāma (like unto the gem and its lustre, the Sun and its sheen).




## 4.2.9
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நங்கைமீர்! நீரும் ஓர் பெண் பெற்று நல்கினீர்,  
எங்ஙனே சொல்லுகேன் யான் பெற்ற ஏழையை,  
சங்கு என்னும் சக்கரம் என்னும் துழாய் என்னும்,  
இங்ஙனே சொல்லும் இராப் பகல் என்செய்கேன்?

naṅkaimīr! nīrum ōr peṇ peṟṟu nalkiṉīr,  
eṅṅaṉē collukēṉ yāṉ peṟṟa ēḻaiyai,  
caṅku eṉṉum cakkaram eṉṉum tuḻāy eṉṉum,  
iṅṅaṉē collum irāp pakal eṉceykēṉ?

**English translation of verse 4.2.9:**

Ye, ladies, you too have reared up daughters,  
But what to say of mine, this odd thing of a daughter?  
Day and night, she keeps mentioning the Lord’s conch,  
The discus and tuḷaci; what can I do for her, as such?

**Note**

Addressing her mates, the Mother points out the difference between their daughters and hers. Deeply engrossed with God-love, Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī’s speech is halting; not being sufficiently articulate, she spells out, at long intervals, the words ‘conch’, ‘discus’ and ‘tuḷaci’.




## 4.2.10
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

என் செய்கேன்? என்னுடைப் பேதை என் கோமளம்,  
என் சொல்லும் என் வசமும் அல்லள் நங்கைமீர்,  
மின் செய் பூண் மார்பினன் கண்ணன் கழல் துழாய்,  
பொன் செய்பூண் மென்முலைக்கு என்று மெலியுமே

eṉ ceykēṉ? eṉṉuṭaip pētai eṉ kōmaḷam,  
eṉ collum eṉ vacamum allaḷ naṅkaimīr,  
miṉ cey pūṇ mārpiṉaṉ kaṇṇaṉ kaḻal tuḻāy,  
poṉ ceypūṇ meṉmulaikku eṉṟu meliyumē

**English translation of verse 4.2.10:**

Ye, ladies, what shall I do with my daughter?  
She listens not to me, being immature and tender,  
Well beyond control, poor thing, she is getting thinner,  
Wanting to decorate her fond but languishing breast  
With tuḷaci worn on the feet of Kaṇṇaṉ on whose chest,  
Broad and bedecked, the jewels gleam bright.

**Note**

The ladies, to whom the Mother complains, turn round and ask her whether she could not counsel her daughter suitably and keep her under restraint. The Mother regrets that her daughter has gone out of hand, being enthralled by the charming personality of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, bedecked with lustrous jewels. Unable to secure the tuḷaci, worn on His feet, with which Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī wants to decorate her emaciated but all the more attractive breast, she is thinning down and the Mother just does not know how to deal with a daughter like this, infatuated with God-love, too deep for words. The Mother cannot punish the daughter because she is not merely immature but much-too-tender to stand the punishment. Bringing the God-intoxicated daughter round to the commonplace standards through routine advice, is also out of the question.




## 4.2.11
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மெலியும் நோய் தீர்க்கும் நம் கண்ணன் கழல்கள்மேல்,  
மலி புகழ் வண் குருகூர்ச் சடகோபன் சொல்,  
ஒலி புகழ் ஆயிரத்து இப்பத்தும் வல்லவர்  
மலி புகழ் வானவர்க்கு ஆவர் நல் கோவையே. (2)

meliyum nōy tīrkkum nam kaṇṇaṉ kaḻalkaḷmēl,  
mali pukaḻ vaṇ kurukūrc caṭakōpaṉ col,  
oli pukaḻ āyirattu ippattum vallavar  
mali pukaḻ vāṉavarkku āvar nal kōvaiyē. (2)

**English translation of verse 4.2.11:**

Those that can recite these songs ten  
Out of the thousand glorious songs of Kurukūr Caṭakōpaṉ,  
Of established fame, adoring the feet of Kaṇṇaṉ,  
The cure certain for the wasting malady of separation from Him,  
Will on a par be with the celestials in heaven, of great fame.

**Note**

This end-stanza spells out the benefit accruing to those who are conversant with the ten preceding stanzas. The scholars will enjoy parity with the ‘Nitya Sūris’, the Ever-free angels in heaven. As the Āḻvār who pined for the tuḷaci at the feet of the Lord all along now describes those very feet as the cure for the malady of separation from Him, it is clear that the Lord has again obliged the Āḻvār with His beaming presence and regaled him, even as Lord Kṛṣṇa regaled the Gopīs, after a spell of separation from them.
