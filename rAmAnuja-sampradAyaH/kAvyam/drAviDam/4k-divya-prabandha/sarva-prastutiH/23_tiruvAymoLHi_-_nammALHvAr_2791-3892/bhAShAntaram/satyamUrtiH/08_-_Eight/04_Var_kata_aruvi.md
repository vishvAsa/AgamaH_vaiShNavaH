## 00 Intro9.4
The Lord’s presence, in this dark land, alone and unaided, excited the reasonable fear of the Āḻvār that the worldlings would approach Him only to achieve their own selfish ends, with little or no care or love for Him. No doubt, the Lord allayed the Āḻvār’s fears, as we saw towards the end of the last decad. Still, the Lord has a lingering doubt that, in the exuberance of the Āḻvār’s love for Him, he might once again entertain similar fears about His safety and feel agitated. And so. He wanted to dispel the Āḻvār’s fears, with no chance whatever of their revival and revealed unto him His invulnerable abode in Tirucceṅkuṉṟūr Tirucciṟṟāṟu (in present Kerala State), out of bounds to the ungodly, attended by the mighty band of three thousand Vedic scholars, full of devotion. As a further precaution, the Lord also exhibited unto the Āḻvār, His wondrous deeds revealing His extra-ordinary strength and valour. With his fears thus eradicated *in toto*, the Āḻvār could whole-heartedly enjoy in this decad the Lord’s exquisite beauty.

A striking parallel to this can be found in Lord Rāma’s exhortation to Sugrīva, the monkey king, by way of dispelling his fears regarding Vibhīṣaṇa’s admission into their camp. In the heated debate that was going on, opposition to the grant of asylum to Vibhīṣaṇa was mounting high. Interveningin the debate, the Lord asserted, *inter alia*, that He could, if He liked, destroy the Rākṣasas all the world over (not merely those in Laṅkā) with the mere tip of His thumb. This was enough to root out Sugrīva’s fears about the possible ill-effects of granting asylum to Vibhīṣaṇa, come down from Rāvaṇa’s Laṅkā.

The reassured Sugrīva, the erstwhile leader of the opposition in the debate that preceded, exclaimed:

> “Oh, Rāma, You have a thorough mastery over the subtleties of Dharma;
> as the Protector of the entire universe, your creed is to instil
> happiness in one and all and it is indeed praiseworthy. I am now quite
> clear in my mind about the bonafides of Vibhīṣaṇa and it is but meet
> that I myself go up to him, anchored in the mid-air, and bring him
> here.”

While Śrī Rāma quelled the fears of Sugrīva and others in His camp by a mere utterance, as above, Lord Kṛṣṇa set at naught the grim fears of the on-lookers through actual demonstration of His immense strength, making mincemeat of the monstrous wrestlers, set up by Kaṃsa, in no time.

**Tamil text and transliteration:**

**English translation of verse 8.4.1:**

Tirucceṅkuṉṟūr Tirucciṟṟāṟu is unto us the fearless haven,  
Where resides the victorious cowherd young (Kṛṣṇa) who pulled down  
Kañcaṉ from the floor above and slew, having already slain  
The wrestlers at the palace gate and the elephant terrific.  
Like unto a mountain in must, pulling out its tusks,  
The twin peaks and the mahout as well, making the armed kings around run back.

**Notes:**

The valour, exhibited by the Lord unto the Āḻvār, permeates this very song, as seen from its martial tempo. Kuvalayāpīṭa, the huge elephant, in must, stationed right at the entrance to Kaṃsa’s palace, is compared to a mountain with its cascades and the tusks of the elephant, the mountain peaks. The Divine cowherd boy slew the elephant effortlessly and killed the mahout also.

The rest is self-explanatory and yet, it is interesting to note down here what Ācārya Ammaṅki Ammāl said about the Lord’s decapitation of Kaṃsa.

> “The Lord makes, at His pleasure, a king of a man and invests him with
> a crown and other insignia of royalty; but when it pleases Him to
> unmake the King, he is deprived, first, o all his royal emblems, and,
> thus stripped, the erstwhile King becomes a mere pigmy of a man and he
> is then punished as he might deserve.”

It was a frustrated and terribly frightened Kaṃsa, who had taken shelter in the first floor of his palace, who was pounced upon by young Kṛṣṇa who shot up to where the felon of an uncle was hiding. The Divine lad pulled Kaṃsa down, by the locks and broke him up like an earthen pot, still wet.

**English translation of verse 8.4.2:**

Saviour have I none but the Primate, my very life,  
Residingin fertile Tirucceṅkuṉṟūr Tirucciṟṟāṟu, our haven safe,  
The overlord of the Celestials, our Nectar, who takes on,  
For the creation of the sprawling worlds, their sustentation  
And dissolution, the triple forms appropriate.

**Notes:**

In the preceding song, the Lord displayed His valour and now He reveals His nectarean sweetness. When the Āḻvār refers to Him, as ‘our Nectar’, instead of “My Nectar’, it only bespeaks his universal love and catholicity, his deep concern for us all, who have the great, good fortune to be connected with him. the Progenitor of the clan of ‘Prapannas’, vide also II-7. The Lord discharges the functions of creation and dissolution, standing within Brahmā and Rudra, as their Internal Controller, while He Himself looks after the function of ‘Protection’ of the whole Universe. Such a one stays permanently in Tirucciṟṟāru in His Iconic Form, (Unlike His Incarnate Forms as Rāma and Kṛṣṇa, of limited duration, in by-gone days), the safe haven of the Āḻvār and all those associated with him.

**English translation of verse 8.4.3:**

The Lord is the Master of the Celestials and me alike;  
From beneath the waters deep, the wide Earth He pulled along;  
His is the glory of destroying, in a trice, my dire sins age-long  
And making me His vassal; embedded in my thoughts, as my sole refuge,  
Are the feet of my Lord, Who does on the west bank reside  
Of Tiruccheṅkuṉṟūr Tirucciṟṟāṟu, the beaming jewel of the south.

**Notes:**

The Lord is the Master of the exalted Celestials and that proclaims His Supremacy; but then, He is also the Master of the Āḻvār, the lowliest of the lowly and this brings out His amazing simplicity. The Lord could enlist the Āḻvār as His vassal, by revealing unto him His great prowess as the Sustainer and Redeemer of the universe, during and after the deluge, respectively; the Āḻvār, therefore, seeks refuge at His feet and his mind cannot turn towards any one else.

**English translation of verse 8.4.4:**

Refuge have I none but the pair of feet of my Lord,  
Who stays in Tirucciṟṟāṟu with orchards, fine and fertile,  
In all His true splendour, the Benefactor great, Who did unto me reveal  
His emerald Form lovely, Vāmana, my Sire, Who grew big and spread  
All the worlds over, who the bellowing ocean once churned.

**Notes:**

\(i\) If, as a tender Babe, the Lord could hold in His stomach all the worlds, where was the need for Him to grow big and span all the worlds in three strides, instead of doing it in His diminutive Form as Vāmana, with which He had demanded the gift of land from Bali? The great Nampiḻḷai has a ready answer, admirable as usual. The expansion of the Lord’s Form into Tṛvikrama, was due to the exuberance of His joy in having accomplished the mission for which He incarnated.

\(ii\) Whenever the episode of the churning of the ocean is alluded to, the Āḻvār invariably feels why the Lord, of remarkable tenderness, should have under taken all the trouble, when there were large numbers of Devas and Asuras, rugged enough, for the job. Actually, those guys, with all their complement, were not equal to the task and the Lord had to assume two different forms and join both the groups, so as to put His own shoulders to the wheel and deliver the goods.

\(iii\) The Lord of such great prowess has manifested Himself in all His pristine splendour in the Iconic Form in which He stays at Tirucceṅkuṉṟūr Tirucciṟṟāṟu, so that every one could recognise Him as the Supreme Lord.

**English translation of verse 8.4.5:**

True’tis, the Lord enshrined in temples elsewhere isn’t different  
From the One in Tirucceṅkuṉṟūr Tirucciṟṟāṟu enshrined and yet  
My mind abides not, in any other;’tis indeed my haven safe,  
Where there are castles, tall and elegant and the fumes fragrant  
Shoot from the ritual fire and darken the firmament.

**Notes:**

\(i\) While conceding the fact that the Lord, enshrined in Tirucciṟṟāṟu, also graces many other pilgrim centres, the Āḻvār says that his mind stands rivetted to this particular centre. This is like Hanumān having abjured even the Heaven and preferred to stay in this abode itself, saying, “Bhāvo nānyatra gacchati”.

\(ii\) The rituals performed by the Brahmins of this sacred place were not for securing any selfish ends and thus ‘niṣkāmya’ done, not with an eye on results, but as an end in itself. Even if there was a motive behind, it could be only by way of warding off the evil forces, the ungodly, so that no harm shall befall the Deity. This is, by-no-means, objectionable, as Nampiḷḷai would say. Even the great Rāmānuja had recourse to special rituals, using spells and incantations invoking Lord Veṅkaṭeśvara of Holy Tirupati, for cutting out the seemingly interminable life of that felon, the cruel Cola king, Kṛmikaṇṭha (worm-necked) whose religious persecution had forced that Saint to stay away from Sri-raṅgam for eleven long years. After a lapse of two or three days, a stinking smell, like that of singed hair, emanated from the sacrificial fire, whereupon Saint Rāmānuja stopped the ceremony, guessing that the heretical Cōḷa must be dead. The same day, a doorkeeper of Cōḷa poked the king in the neck with a staff, causing a loathsome stinking sore, full of vermin and the King gave up his ghost.

**English translation of verse 8.4.6:**

My haven safe, my sole Sustainer, the All-in-one unto Celestials,  
He, who can’t gauge His own disposition (unfathomable),  
He, who does on the ocean vast repose, I could envision  
In Tirucceṅkuṉṟūṟ Tirucciṟṟāṟu, abounding in solid mansions  
And Brahmins numbering three thousand, potent like the mighty Civaṉ,  
And Ayaṉ, in whose whose hearts the Lord stands enshrined.

**Notes:**

\(i\) It may be recalled that, as already mentioned in the preamble to this decad, the Lord pacified the Āḻvār and disarmed him of his fears, by pointing out to him this very setting. The Lord is safe and sound in this pilgrim centre, surrounded by three thousand brahmins who are as potent as Brahmā and Śivā and could as well discharge the functions assigned by the Lord to those exalted functionaries, c.f. Śloka 20 of Āḷavantār’s Stotra Ratna—

> “tvadāśritānaam jagadudbhavasthiti, praṇāsa saṃsāra vimocanadayaḥ
> bhavanti leela,”

Which means:

> “The creation, preservation and dissolution of the universe, release
> from family bondage etc., constitute the sporting activities of Your
> devotees themselves”.

\(ii\) These Brahmins, immersed in devout contemplation of the Lord’s numerous auspicious traits, are ever alert to the impending danger, studiously safeguarding the Deity of their hearts. They are on a par with Sage Bharadvāja, who was apprehensive of the safety of Śrī Rāma and party in exile, during the interval between their first meeting with him and their subsequent return after vanquishing Rāvaṇa.

**English translation of verse 8.4.7:**

Lodged in my heart for ever is the Lord, I envision,  
In Tirucciṟṟāṟu with red lotus-eyes, coral lips and feet red,  
Red palms, the navel lovely, bearing the lotus red,  
The chest red, bearing (Lakṣmi) the lotus-born,  
Silken robes red, the crown red, the lovely jewels and gleaming weapons.

**Notes:**

The Āḻvār goes into the details of the Lord’s exquisite charm—the eyes, broad and bewitching, like the red lotus in fresh bloom, the stabilising smile, that is, the Lord’s smile from His coral lips which stabilises the attraction held out by His gracious looks unto the votaries, the lovely feet at which the votaries, enthralled by the Lord’s scintillating smiles, seek refuge, the hands that gather up and embrace those seeking refuge at His feet, the navel, the seat of all creation, the centre of eternal attraction and enjoyment, the winsome chest bearing the Divine Mother, the great intercessor, who could wean away even the ungodly and make them God-bent, the matching robes, the feardispelling crown proclaiming the Lord’s sovereignty and the beneficent weapons. With this intense enjoyment of the  
Lord’s regal Form, inch by inch, could there at all be any room for any kind of fear in the Āḻvār’s mind?




## 8.4.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

**English translation of verse 8.4.8:**

The Lord sparkling in my heart, Who in holy Tirucciṟṟāṟu resides,  
Adored by the vedic scholars, brahmins bright, from all sides,  
The shelter safe unto exalted Devas but deadly unto Asura hordes,  
The great Sire, who creates, sustains and dissolves the three worlds,  
Him I hardly know how unto my heart’s fill I can laud.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The exaltation of the Devas results from their ability to grant the boons, sought by their respective votaries. Even these luminaries seek refuge in the Supreme Lord in times of dire need and danger. Did not the Lord save Prajāpati (Brahmā) from a calamity like the spoliation of the vedas and Paśupati (Śiva) from the sin of patricide and molestation by demons, besides conferring on them several other benefits? At the same time, the Lord is worse than deadly to the ungodly Asuras, who give endless trouble to Devas.

\(ii\) The Āḻvār cannot resist the urge to praise the Lord of such great glory but, at the same time, he does not know how to laud Him, the precise manner in which he could sing the Lord’s praise. At best, he can only say, in general terms, that the Lord controls the triple functions of creation, sustentation and dissolution of the three worlds and so on.




## 8.4.9

**English translation of verse 8.4.9:**

The Lord, Who lovingly stays in Tirucciṟṟāṟu where do reside  
The Brahmins, known alike for their piety and generosity, richly endowed  
With knowledge sharp and power immense and in worship well engaged,  
Is the One, Who, creation, sustentation and dissolution, controls,  
Who, Brahmā and Śiva. directs, as their Internal Controller  
And staying in between them protects the Universe, pervades every one  
And things, one and all;’tis indeed no exaggeration.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The Āḻvār avers that the Lord, enshrined in holy Tirucceṅkuṉṟūr Tirucciṟṟāṟu is the One, who controls all creatures from Brahmā down to the tiny insect and directs them through the different stages of creation, sustenance and dissolution, like unto the Soul directing and supporting the body.

\(ii\) This song also highlights the manifold glory of the Brahmins residing in this holy centre, whose attainments place them on a par with the Lord Himself. The Āḻvār, finds it really heartening that there are a good many of them, attending on the Lord unremittingly, with great devotion.

**English translation of verse 8.4.10:**

The worthy Master, the Lover great of His votaries all,  
The great Granter of boons by them sought, one and all,  
Who resides in fertile Tirucciṟṟāṟu, the home and hearth  
Of the three thousand brahmins and Vaiṣṇavas, the Devas on Earth,  
The wondrous Lord I have attained, who dwells within  
The triple-eyed Sire (Śiva) and (Brahmā) Nāṉmukaṉ.

**Notes:**

The Supreme Lord, Mahā Viṣṇu alone deserves the appellation, ‘Master’. His supremacy notwithstanding, He has made Himself visible and easily accessible to one and all, staying in the holy Tirucceṅkuṉṟūr Tirucciṟṟāṟu. The Āḻvār says, he has attained the Great Master, right here. The Lord is the one and only Giver, a liberal Donor, who exults in lavishing His bounty on all those who seek favours from Him.

**English translation of verse 8.4.11:**

These ten songs out of the thousand of Kurukūr Caṭakōpaṉ,  
Adoring the Lord, highly delicious, like honey, milk and canejuice,  
Who in His stomach did all the worlds sustain,  
The wondrous Lord, who did on the cool lotus, from His navel, produce  
The exalted Brahmā, will their chanters lift unto Heaven  
And engage them in the eternal service of the Lord,  
The mysterious cycle of birth and rebirth, no more to dread.

**Notes:**

\(i\) Release from family bondage, that is, end of the great saga of worldly life and attainment of the final bliss of eternal service unto the Lord in Heaven are the benefits of chanting this decad. Attainment of the heavenly bliss automatically results in the severance of worldly ties, like unto the prince, languishing in prison, being crowned as soon as the king dies, (so as to avoid the land going without a monarch even for a while), followed by the removal of his fetters.

\(ii\) The Āḻvār grew apprehensive of the Lord’s safety because of His extra-ordinary sweetness, like unto honey, milk and cane-juice and this fear got dispelled by the recollection of the Lord’s unique prowess in sustaining all the worlds, during the deluge.
