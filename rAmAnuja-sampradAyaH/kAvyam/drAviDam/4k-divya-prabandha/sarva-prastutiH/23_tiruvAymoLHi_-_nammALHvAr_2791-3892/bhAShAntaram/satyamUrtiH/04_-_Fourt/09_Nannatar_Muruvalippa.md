## 00 Intro4.9
In the last decad, the Āḻvār got terribly vexed with himself and his possessions and wanted to give up his body, life, that and the other. But, even for this kind of dissolution, he had to depend upon the Lord’s help, as in the case of salvation. And so, he prays to the Lord to finish him off altogether. The Āḻvār’s ardour in this respect is remarkable. His longing to get out of this world is due to (1) frequent interruptions in communion with the Lord and the resultant pangs of separation, (2) intolerance of contacts with the worldlings, straying away from Him and (3) the cruel impact of the five senses and the domineering sense-organs, with the serious risk of his straying back into the domain of the sensual pleasures.

In the last decad, we saw the Āḻvār’s pangs of separation from the Lord; in VII-1, he dwells upon the cruel impact of the sense, while, in this decad, he displays his intolerance of living in the midst of the worldlings.

It would indeed be some consolation if the Āḻvār who had the misfortune of not being able to see God, lived at least in the midst of those who were not averse to seeing Him. But even this bit of solace, the Āḻvār felt, he was being denied, having to live in the midst of the worldlings, watching their scramble for food and raiment and their stupid pursuits after sensual pleasures, farther away from God. How then could he tolerate this agonising state of affairs? Did not Tirumaṅkai Āḻvār declare that he shall not think, even for a moment, about those who do not meditate on the Lord reclining on the seashore at the pilgrim centre, called ‘Kaṭaṉmallai’ in the Bay of Bengal? Conveying the same sentiment, in a slightly different manner, that Āḻvār also said that sweet were the moments when he didn’t think of those miserable humans who would not cherish in their hearts the Lord enshrined at Tirukkaṇṇamaṅkai and bear His lovely feet on their heads. Vibhīṣaṇa abandoned Laṅkā and flew towards Rāma’s camp on the other shore, determined to get out of the territory of Rāvaṇa, the heinous offender, whatever be the prospects of his (vibhīṣaṇa) admission into Rāma’s camp. Saint Nammāḻvār would likewise want to get out of this wretched abode but even this could be got done only at the Lord’s volition. Therefore it is, he appeals to Him, in this decad, in such moving terms as, ‘pray, deign to take me unto Your feet expeditiously’, ‘Pray, hasten my death that I may unto Your feet attain’, “when will you clear me out of this fortress and lift me unto Your feet in Heaven?” etc. Life in the midst of blazing fire is indeed preferable to staying in the company of the sinners who just do not know what it is to think of God.

The genesis of this decad is appreciated by Empār and Kūrattāḻvāṉ in two different ways. According to Empār, it is like this: The Āḻvār prays unto the Lord, “My Lord, I could, in a way, put up with my grief due to my separation from you. But it is very much beyond me to bear the misery of staying in the midst of the worldlings who do not reckon with you at all, and wallow in sex and sensuality; you would, therefore, do well to put an end to this kind of misery which can neither be cured nor endured and take me out of this abode”.

Kūrattāḻvāṉ’s elucidation is, however, as follows: The Āḻvār’s attention turned on the world around in search of like-minded persons with whom he could share his grief due to separation from  
God and secure some relief. But he found them all steeped in sensual pleasures, as intensely as he himself was in the realm of God-love and God enjoyment. This was, according to the Āḻvār, far more calamitous than his own privation and he, therefore, forgot his own misery, like unto a person stung by a scorpion not minding his own agony so much, when he sees another in greater distress, smitten by a sword. The Āḻvār, therefore, enters into a dialogue with the Lord and pleads for the redemption of the worldlings but the Lord asks the Āḻvār not to worry about them who are sense-buried, totally oblivious of Him and leave them to their fate. Thereupon, the Āḻvār insists that he should no longer be kept in their midst. The Lord, however, consoled the Āḻvār by pointing out to him that he was already on a pedestal of his own, unattached to the world. As a further concession, by way of curing the Āḻvār’s grief caused by his looking at the world, the Lord revealed to him the glorious setting in Heaven where He is seen along with the Divine Mother, Lakṣmī, surrounded by the exalted Celestials. Beholding this heavenly splendour with great joy, the Āḻvār ends this decad on a jubilant note. Such an approach is only indicative of the melting tenderness of heart of Kūrattāḷvāṉ and his extraordinary solicitude for fellow-beings. It is said that once he saw, as he was passing along, a frog in the jaws of a snake, croaking piteously in agony. He sighed, “Alas! to whom does this frog appeal and who will hear it and come to its rescue?” and fainted.




## 4.9.1
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நண்ணாதார் முறுவலிப்ப நல் உற்றார் கரைந்து ஏங்க,  
எண் ஆராத் துயர் விளைக்கும் இவை என்ன உலகு இயற்கை?,  
கண்ணாளா! கடல் கடைந்தாய்! உன கழற்கே வரும் பரிசு,  
தண்ணாவாது அடியேனைப் பணி கண்டாய் சாமாறே. (2)

naṇṇātār muṟuvalippa nal uṟṟār karaintu ēṅka,  
eṇ ārāt tuyar viḷaikkum ivai eṉṉa ulaku iyaṟkai?,  
kaṇṇāḷā! kaṭal kaṭaintāy! uṉa kaḻaṟkē varum paricu,  
taṇṇāvātu aṭiyēṉaip paṇi kaṇṭāy cāmāṟē. (2)

**English translation of verse 4.9.1:**

Oh, what a world is this, which countless miseries breeds,  
Where over one’s privations, friends and relations do grieve  
While the hostile ones do with joy immense chuckle!  
Oh, merciful Lord who did the milk-ocean churn,  
Pray hasten my end so that I do your feet attain.

**Notes:**

The Āḻvār lays before the Lord two options, namely, curing the miseries of the worldlings or terminating his stay over here. It is a fantastic world, without a correct perspective of good and bad things. When calamities befall a person, his friends and relations bemoan his lot while his foes rejoice, as if there is a festivity in their homes. This is indeed too much for the Āḻvār to bear.

The Āḻvār seems to suggest to the Lord who undertook all that trouble to churn the milk-ocean and deliver the nectar unto the selfish Devas, that He could also mend the ways of the world and cure them of their miseries. The Lord said, there was nothing He could do in the case of the worldlings who did not reckon with Him at all, and struck a divergent path. So then, the Āḻvār is pressing the other alternative, namely, cutting out the tenure of his stay here, like unto the one caught up in forest fire looking for water and shelter, the immediate needs.




## 4.9.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

சாம் ஆறும் கெடும் ஆறும் தமர் உற்றார் தலைத்தலைப்பெய்து,  
ஏமாறிக் கிடந்து அலற்றும் இவை என்ன உலகு இயற்கை?,  
ஆம் ஆறு ஒன்று அறியேன் நான் அரவு அணையாய்! அம்மானே,  
கூமாறே விரைகண்டாய் அடியேனை குறிக்கொண்டே.

cām āṟum keṭum āṟum tamar uṟṟār talaittalaippeytu,  
ēmāṟik kiṭantu alaṟṟum ivai eṉṉa ulaku iyaṟkai?,  
ām āṟu oṉṟu aṟiyēṉ nāṉ aravu aṇaiyāy! ammāṉē,  
kūmāṟē viraikaṇṭāy aṭiyēṉai kuṟikkoṇṭē.

**English translation of verse 4.9.2:**

My Sire, resting on serpent-bed, I shudder  
How I can out of this mesh escape unhurt,  
Pray call me quick unto your lovely feet;  
Oh, what a world this is! death befalls all of a sudden  
And people are beset with miseries umpteen,  
Grief-stricken, the near ones do their lots bemoan,  
Falling on each other, indeed a pathetic scene.

**Notes**

\(i\) The material world taints people to an alarming extent. They plan ahead for a long stay here but death suddenly overtakes them like the thunderbolt. They set much store by their so called possessions, and sink into grief, when they get dispossessed due to loss by fire, theft etc. They are so miserably addicted to lucre as to look upon their dear money as even more valuable than life. They look upon their earthly relations as all-in-all and when they pass away, they cry out their hearts. Apprehending that continued stay in such a world might taint him also, the Āḻvār lustily pleads with the Lord to arrange for his early exist from this abode. In this land of nescience, the Āḻvār is probably the solitary Soul crying out for such emancipation, and the Āḻvār wants the Lord to take special note of it.

\(ii\) A striking illustration has been given in Īṭu, depicting the worldly men’s morbid love of lucre. A man, accused of treason, had his legs and hands lopped off under the King’s orders. However, when his friends came to condole with him in his dire misfortune, he took the initiative and asked them to congratulate him, rather than condole with him, for having been let off so lightly without being called upon to part with a portion of his dear money. The compassionate hearts of Saints like Nammāḻvār naturally deplore the fate of such men who pin all their faith on lucre, totally oblivious of God.




## 4.9.3
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கொண்டாட்டும் குலம் புனைவும் தமர் உற்றார் விழு நிதியும்,  
வண்டு ஆர் பூங் குழலாளும், மனை ஒழிய உயிர் மாய்தல்,  
கண்டு ஆற்றேன் உலகு இயற்கை கடல்வண்ணா! அடியேனைப்  
பண்டேபோல் கருதாது உன் அடிக்கே கூய்ப் பணிக்கொள்ளே.

koṇṭāṭṭum kulam puṉaivum tamar uṟṟār viḻu nitiyum,  
vaṇṭu ār pūṅ kuḻalāḷum, maṉai oḻiya uyir māytal,  
kaṇṭu āṟṟēṉ ulaku iyaṟkai kaṭalvaṇṇā! aṭiyēṉaip  
paṇṭēpōl karutātu uṉ aṭikkē kūyp paṇikkoḷḷē.

**English translation of verse 4.9.3:**

My Lord of oceanic hue, think not of this vassal as before,  
Lift me up that I may serve right at your feet,  
Endure I can’t the trends of the world, any more;  
Unto name and fame shoot up people overnight, these upstarts  
Acquire home and hearth, the bride fair and all that.  
But leaving them all behind, life suddenly departs.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The Ācāryas who have delved deep into the śāstras and acquired a keen insight of Vedanta, the spiritual domain, are no less keen in their observation of the mechanics of the mundane world, as revealed by the commentary on this song. A fellow who was nobody till yesterday, suddenly comes by a few chips and gets boosted by people around, waiting for a suitable opportunity to grab from him. The fellow of obscure origin and humble parentage, having risen to fortune, becomes vain and starts masquerading as one of high descent, under the cloak of his new-found wealth. Relations who would not acknowledge him earlier, throng round him now and openly parade their kinship with him. Fathers who would not even look at him and much less consider him as eligible for the hand of their daughters, now vie with each other in netting him. Our hero who has now amassed money which generally accumulates like the dried leaves dropped from the trees during autumn, also thinks it worthwhile to marry, although he is well beyond the borders of youth. The poor girl, his partner, still in her teens, falls an easy prey to the prying eyes of the greedy youngsters around. The home is jolly well there, built by our hero for him and his wife to live in privacy, but, leaving all these behind, he gives up his ghost one day all of a sudden. Oh, how pathetic! The Āḻvār doesn’t want to stay in this abode any more, watching such harrowing scenes.

\(ii\) *Think not of this vassal as before*. As one Ciṟṟāḷkoṇṭār would put it, the Saint wants the Lord to note that his present appeal is not on a par with his earlier ones, being the offshoot of his mental agony over the calamitous ways of the world and the Lord should not, therefore, ignore his call even as people are prone to ignore the continual tittle-tattles of the newt (wall-lizard).




## 4.9.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கொள் என்று கிளர்ந்து எழுந்த பெரும் செல்வம் நெருப்பு ஆக,  
கொள் என்று தமம் மூடும் இவை என்ன உலகு இயற்கை?  
வள்ளலே! மணிவண்ணா! உன கழற்கே வரும்பரிசு,  
வள்ளல் செய்து அடியேனை உனது அருளால் வாங்காயே.

koḷ eṉṟu kiḷarntu eḻunta perum celvam neruppu āka,  
koḷ eṉṟu tamam mūṭum ivai eṉṉa ulaku iyaṟkai?  
vaḷḷalē! maṇivaṇṇā! uṉa kaḻaṟkē varumparicu,  
vaḷḷal ceytu aṭiyēṉai uṉatu aruḷāl vāṅkāyē.

**English translation of verse 4.9.4:**

Bounteous Lord of sapphire hue, may Your benevolent grace  
On me alight and lift me up to Your feet!  
How impudent is this world, in nescience steeped,  
Madly after the riches elusive, which only gut  
The whole lot like the fire well ablaze!

**Notes:**

\(i\) Material wealth is a virtual man-killer, being open to the hazards of theft, arson and even murder, not to speak of the rank jealousy it kindles in the have-nots, friends and the relations and the disastrous results that follow. In short, the so-called earthly riches literally burn down the wielders, like fire which burns out whatever it gets hold of. The worldlings are fully aware of the potential harm of the riches and yet, truly characteristic of the ‘tamas’, darkness that envelops their minds, they do not profit by this knowledge but madly run after the mundane wealth and perish. Persistence in mistakes without profiting by the experience of their own and others is a fundamental characteristic of ‘tamas’ which dominates these unwary people, who would tumble, during nights, into the very pits which they had clearly seen by day.

\(ii\) It is indeed His unbounded generosity, that the Lord presents His exquisite Form of Sapphire hue!




## 4.9.5
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வாங்கு நீர் மலர் உலகில் நிற்பனவும் திரிவனவும்,  
ஆங்கு உயிர்கள் பிறப்பு இறப்புப் பிணி மூப்பால் தகர்ப்புண்ணும்,  
ஈங்கு இதன்மேல் வெம் நரகம் இவை என்ன உலகு இயற்கை?  
வாங்கு எனை நீ மணிவண்ணா! அடியேனை மறுக்கேலே.

vāṅku nīr malar ulakil niṟpaṉavum tirivaṉavum,  
āṅku uyirkaḷ piṟappu iṟappup piṇi mūppāl takarppuṇṇum,  
īṅku itaṉmēl vem narakam ivai eṉṉa ulaku iyaṟkai?  
vāṅku eṉai nī maṇivaṇṇā! aṭiyēṉai maṟukkēlē.

**English translation of verse 4.9.5:**

Confound not this vassal, oh, gem-hued Lord,  
Pray take me out of this sprawling world,  
Which from the waters emerged, where all creatures.

Static and mobile, are seen screaming,  
Ground by the wheel of birth, death, old age  
And pestilence and going hence to hell to drudge.

**Notes**

\(i\) *Āḻvār to the Lord*: “Sire, are you keeping me on in this abode, just to witness and realise the harrowing depth of the sufferings of the worldlings, tossed up between birth on one side, and death, on the other, and old age and pestilence, in between? and then there are the postmortem sufferings in hell, far more severe. I pray Thee not to stir up my feelings any more, but to take me unto Thy feet without any further delay.”

\(ii\) The frequent reference to the Gem hued Lord in these songs, emphasises the fact that the Āḻvār was weaned from the world, only when he came under the magic spell of His exquisite Form.




## 4.9.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மறுக்கி வல் வலைப்படுத்தி குமைத்திட்டு கொன்று உண்பர்,  
அறப்பொருளை அறிந்து ஓரார் இவை என்ன உலகு இயற்கை?  
வெறித் துளவ முடியானே! வினையேனை உனக்கு அடிமை-  
அறக்கொண்டாய், இனி என் ஆர் அமுதே! கூயருளாயே.

maṟukki val valaippaṭutti kumaittiṭṭu koṉṟu uṇpar,  
aṟapporuḷai aṟintu ōrār ivai eṉṉa ulaku iyaṟkai?  
veṟit tuḷava muṭiyāṉē! viṉaiyēṉai uṉakku aṭimai-  
aṟakkoṇṭāy, iṉi eṉ ār amutē! kūyaruḷāyē.

**English translation of verse 4.9.6:**

Oh, Lord, wearing on Your crown tuḷaci garland fragrant,  
My perfect Nectar, You have as Your vassal enlisted  
This sinner great and now I pray that You grant  
Me a lift and clear me out of this place I detest,  
Where men live by torturing others, immorality running rampant.

**Note**

It is indeed remarkable that Saint Nammāḻvār, seated in the hollow of a tamarind tree inside the temple, could televise, as it were, the happenings in the world around and lament, “oh, the ways of the world!” He deplores the unfair means by which people hoard lucre, throwing morals to the winds. Here is a typical example of the nefarious means by which people stuff their stomachs.

A poor, harmless soul, having a little bit of money, went to a village, thinking that he could live there in peace. The headman of the village, however, frightened the new-comer by telling him that the people around suspected him and might even harm him. Put in dread, the simple fellow succumbed to the artifice of the headman and entrusted all money and land to the latter’s custody. Lest the poor victim should, later on, make bold to demand his money and land, the headman got a document executed in his favour for a loan, not actually paid, and interest was made to accumulate thereon. Not stopping with all these machinations, the headman feared exposure of his infamy sometime or the other and, therefore, contrived to murder the poor fellow and thus did away with him altogether.

Little wonder then, the Saint deplored and detested such surroundings and longed to get away.




## 4.9.7
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஆயே! இவ் உலகத்து நிற்பனவும் திரிவனவும்  
நீயே மற்று ஒரு பொருளும் இன்றி நீ நின்றமையால்,  
நோயே மூப்பு இறப்பு பிறப்பு பிணியே என்று இவை ஒழிய,  
கூயேகொள் அடியேனை கொடு உலகம் காட்டேலே.

āyē! iv ulakattu niṟpaṉavum tirivaṉavum  
nīyē maṟṟu oru poruḷum iṉṟi nī niṉṟamaiyāl,  
nōyē mūppu iṟappu piṟappu piṇiyē eṉṟu ivai oḻiya,  
kūyēkoḷ aṭiyēṉai koṭu ulakam kāṭṭēlē.

**English translation of verse 4.9.7:**

My Lord, all things in this world,  
Still or mobile, are by you controlled;  
I pray that this vassal be not shown  
This wicked world but be shorn  
Of birth, death, old age and pestilence  
And lifted up to Your feet in high heavens.

**Notes**

\(i\) *Lord to the Āḻvār*: Why don’t you try to get what you aspire for, without my interference?

\(ii\) *Āḻvār to the Lord*: Sire, not a tiny twig can move without Your aid. Having segregated me from the rest, as a legitimate aspirant for entry into heaven, why don’t you release me from this world and make me a ‘Mukta’, the released soul in heaven, which You intend me to be?




## 4.9.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

காட்டி நீ கரந்து உமிழும் நிலம் நீர் தீ விசும்பு கால்,  
ஈட்டி நீ வைத்து அமைத்த இமையோர் வாழ் தனி முட்டைக்,  
கோட்டையினில் கழித்து என்னை உன் கொழும் சோதி உயரத்துக்,  
கூட்டு அரிய திருவடிக்கள் எஞ்ஞான்று கூட்டுதியே?

kāṭṭi nī karantu umiḻum nilam nīr tī vicumpu kāl,  
īṭṭi nī vaittu amaitta imaiyōr vāḻ taṉi muṭṭaik,  
kōṭṭaiyiṉil kaḻittu eṉṉai uṉ koḻum cōti uyarattuk,  
kūṭṭu ariya tiruvaṭikkaḷ eññāṉṟu kūṭṭutiyē?

**English translation of verse 4.9.8:**

My Lord, when will You take me unto Your feet  
In the resplendent heaven, difficult to attain,  
Pulling me out of this fortress the cosmic egg You did ordain  
Out of the elements five, which for a time shone  
Then got inside Your stomach and was then let out?

**Notes:**

\(i\) The Lord tells the Āḻvār that He would certainly fulfil the Āḻvār’s desire. The Āḻvār, however, wants to know when exactly He would do it. The Lord has to set a date for the Āḻvār’s entry into heaven, even as Bharata was assured of Śrī Rāma’s return from exile at the end of fourteen years.

\(ii\) Piḻḻai Tirunarayūr Araiyar is said to have observed that the net woven around each individual soul by the Almighty Lord, in the light of past Karma, has to be disentangled by Him alone, seeing that we are much-too-feeble and cannot disentangle even a bird’s nest. It is a matter of common knowledge that the intricately woven bird’s nest is neatly disentangled by the bird itself and man can, at best only destroy it, if ever he attempted to disentangle the nest. And so, He alone can undo this bondage of ours, and that He will do, when we clasp His holy feet.




## 4.9.9
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கூட்டுதி நின் குரை கழல்கள் இமையோரும் தொழாவகைசெய்து,  
ஆட்டுதி நீ அரவு அணையாய்! அடியேனும் அஃது அறிவன்,  
வேட்கை எல்லாம் விடுத்து என்னை உன் திருவடியே சுமந்து உழலக்,  
கூட்டு அரிய திருவடிக்கள் கூட்டினை நான் கண்டேனே.

kūṭṭuti niṉ kurai kaḻalkaḷ imaiyōrum toḻāvakaiceytu,

vēṭkai ellām viṭuttu eṉṉai uṉ tiruvaṭiyē cumantu uḻalak,  
kūṭṭu ariya tiruvaṭikkaḷ kūṭṭiṉai nāṉ kaṇṭēṉē.

**English translation of verse 4.9.9:**

Oh, Lord on serpent-bed, this vassal too knows your ways,  
That unto your jingling feet you lift (those by you favoured)  
While even (the exalted) Devas you just keep away;  
Perceive do I, my craze for pleasures sensual you have destroyed  
And me, unto your feet difficult to attain, you now admit  
That I may on my head bear them and roam about.

**Notes**

\(i\) The Lord having revealed to the Āḻvār the glorious setting in Heaven, he rejoices.

\(ii\) Śrī Rāma gave to Bharata only a pair of wooden sandals. But the Lord has now made it possible for the Āḻvār to bear His very feet on his head, and move about. The Āḻvār’s joy, therefore, knows no bounds. The observations made by the Āḻvār, in this song, about the Lord’s ways are not based on hear-say but on his personal experience.




## 4.9.10
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கண்டு கேட்டு உற்று மோந்து உண்டு உழலும் ஐங்கருவி  
கண்ட இன்பம், தெரிவு அரிய அளவு இல்லாச் சிற்றின்பம்,  
ஒண் தொடியாள் திருமகளும் நீயுமே நிலாநிற்ப,  
கண்ட சதிர் கண்டொழிந்தேன் அடைந்தேன் உன் திருவடியே.

kaṇṭu kēṭṭu uṟṟu mōntu uṇṭu uḻalum aiṅkaruvi  
kaṇṭa iṉpam, terivu ariya aḷavu illāc ciṟṟiṉpam,  
oṇ toṭiyāḷ tirumakaḷum nīyumē nilāniṟpa,  
kaṇṭa catir kaṇṭoḻintēṉ aṭaintēṉ uṉ tiruvaṭiyē.

**English translation of verse 4.9.10:**

I beheld you, my Lord, in the glorious company  
Of Tirumakaḷ, wearing on her wrist bangles lovely  
And I abjured the pleasures lowly  
Of the sense-organs five besides the Kaivalya state  
Of bliss limitless, yet inferior and attained your feet.

**Notes**

\(i\) Besides the Lord and Lakṣmī, the Divine Consort, there are millions of ‘Muktas’ (Released Souls) and ‘Nityas’ (Eternal Heroes) in Heaven, in constant attendance on the Divine Couple. Reference to the Lord and the Divine Mother only, in this song, goes to show that all the other denizens of Heaven literally merge in the patronising love of the Divine Couple and do not require to be mentioned separately.

\(ii\) The bangles rest well on the wrists of the Divine Mother, as She is inseparably planted on His winsome chest, unlike the lady-love, separated from her love, who thins down alarmingly and her wrists cannot, therefore, keep the bangles on. Beholding the Lord, in conjunction with the Divine Mother, the Āḻvār naturally pines for uninterrupted bliss of service unto the Couple, eschewing all else on both sides-the sensual pleasures over here and the limitless self-enjoyment (Kaivalya) on the yonder side.




## 4.9.11
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

திருவடியை நாரணனை கேசவனை பரஞ்சுடரை,  
திருவடி சேர்வது கருதி செழுங் குருகூர்ச் சடகோபன்,  
திருவடிமேல் உரைத்த தமிழ் ஆயிரத்துள் இப்பத்தும்,  
திருவடியே அடைவிக்கும் திருவடி சேர்ந்து ஒன்றுமினே. (2)

tiruvaṭiyai nāraṇaṉai kēcavaṉai parañcuṭarai,

tiruvaṭimēl uraitta tamiḻ āyirattuḷ ippattum,  
tiruvaṭiyē aṭaivikkum tiruvaṭi cērntu oṉṟumiṉē. (2)

**English translation of verse 4.9.11:**

These songs ten out of the thousand of Caṭakōpaṉ  
Of fertile Kurukūr, adoring the lovely feet of Nāraṇaṉ,  
The Lord Supreme, Kēcavaṉ, of splendour supreme,  
In order to gain these feet, will lead the chanters on,  
To those very feet; steadfast unto those feet do therefore remain.

**Note**

The Āḻvār exhorts the people of this world to keep on chanting this decad, as long as they stay in this abode, as that will ensure their attaining His feet in Heaven. Throughout this decad, the Āḻvār longed for the feet of the Lord and by merely chanting this decad. one can attain those very feet in Heaven and render uninterrupted service.
