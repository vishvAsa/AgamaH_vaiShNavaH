## 00 Intro1.4
The Sublime and the Sensual have always co-existed in both the worlds-the mundane and the spiritual. There is, however, a fundamental difference in their inter-relationship, in the respective spheres. In the material world, the two are mutually exclusive, being diametrically opposed to each other. In the spiritual world, that which, in the language of aesthetics, is termed as ‘*Śṛṅgār*’, is nothing but the psychological imperative for man’s consciousness moving towards Him (Super-Soul) of ravishing beauty (as *Bhāgavatā* bears out), just the very inversion of the skin-deep, carnal variety of lust, stamping out the human lover-beloved union. If the love-smitten Parāṅkuśa (Nammāḻvār, who was like unto a goad wearing round his spiritual antagonists through his scintillating hymns and making the Lord Himself pliable, enraptured by his sweet, love-laden hymns) turns out to be a female, expressing herself now as Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī (God-lover), then as the Mother, the intuitive gnostic friend of the love-lorn daughter trying to keep the latter under sobering restraint and sometimes as the soothing Mate, it is but the natural corollary to his boundless love for God and the deep yearning, beyond words, for the Divine presence and lasting union. Actually, the Lord is the only Male or Husband (*Loka bhartā*), the ‘*Puruṣottama*’ the *Kṣetrajña*’ and all the Individual souls arc but marks of the feminine, the *Kṣetras*’ (Location),, the female centres of the creative activity of God. It is indeed quite some consolation that the lover-beloved theme is familiar ground for the worldlings and now, without adopting the austere Vedic approach, the Āḻvār would only want them to shift the base and turn the whole drama God-ward and be wholly absorbed in ‘*Daiva Rasa*’ (spiritual love), the ‘*Brahmānubhava*’. Even as the female anatomy plays a key role in the earthly variety of love, in the spiritual world, ‘*Para Bhakti*’, ‘*Para Jñāna*’ and ‘*Parama Bhakti*’, in the ascending scale of God-love, too deep for words, symbolise the breast of the God-lover, swelling up with God-love.

Songs attributed to the Mother and the Mate are all sung by the Āḻvār only. The Mate is the cementing force joining the lover and the Beloved; this Mate is only symbolic of the sense of fusion and belonging, the inalienable relationship of Master and Servant, between God and Man, inculcated by “*Praṇava*” (*Aum*) in ‘*Tirumantra*’. The Mother plays the role of ‘*Namaḥ*’ in the said *Mantra* which puts an embargo on the Individual soul indulging in egoistic self-effort to attain God-head, instead of awaiting the descent of His grace. Thus, she prevents the love-intoxicated Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī from trespassing, that is, breaking all norms of correct feminine conduct, and keeps her under restraint. In this decad, where the Āḻvār is seen transformed as ‘Nāyakī’ (female lover), some birds are sent by her as emissaries to the Lord. This is the first of the four decads in the whole work, where messages are sent by the Āḻvār to the Lord, the other three being VI-1, VI-8 and IX-7. The winged birds typify the efficient preceptors possessed of the mighty wings, a happy blending of knowledge and conduct. This technique of the Āḻvār has been adopted by the subsequent poets as well. C. F. Kālidāsa’s ‘*Meghadūta*’ and Vedānta Deśika’s ‘*Haṃsa Sandeśa*’.

Parāśara Bhaṭṭar would exclaim:

> “The monkeys shot into fame with the advent of Śrī Rāma who employed
> Hanumān as His chosen emissary to Rāvaṇa’s court; likewise the the
> Āḻvārs have made the winged birds famous by commissioning them to
> carry messages to their Beloved God”.

The messages in the four decads, referred to above, were all despatched by the Āḻvār to the Lord but to different destinations, namely, (1) *Vyūha* or the milk-ocean, the seat of the Lord’s creative activity, (ii) the *Vibhava* or the Lord’s incarnate forms, (iii) ‘*Paratva*’ (transcendent) and ‘*Antaryāmi*’ (Internal Controller of all) and (iv) *Arcā* (Iconic manifestaion), in the chronological order. The Āḻvār is now in the same plight as Śakuntalā, left behind in the hermitage, after her initial meeting and union with King Duṣyanta and hence the necessity for this message invoking the Lord’s special trait of forgiveness, by way of overlooking the drawbacks noticed by the Lord in the Āḻvār during their erstwhile union.

And to end this preamble precisely as it was begun, here is an interesting anecdote. When the great Preceptor, Nañcīyar was discoursing on this Tiruvāymoḻi, one of his listeners abruptly left the place, murmuring that the discourse had assumed the complexion of a sensualist’s love-conversation. In the first three decads, the saint had expounded Divinity as the Exalted, the worship-worthy and the Easily-accessible.

The listener in question appreciated these and observed:

> “Here is a grand theme, worthy of acceptance by the world-weary, and
> so long as it treats of the Almighty in His sublime character I am
> bound to listen to it, as a sensible man ought to”.

But, as soon as the Saint changed the Divine discourse into the form of love to God, love treated by analogies taken from the experience of mankind in this world, specially in its relation as Lover and the Beloved, Mistress and Spouse and so on, the disciple turned away from it, thinking that this kind of treatment was a shock to good taste, outrage to his wisdom and a violence to his common-sense. Nañcīyar couldn’t but deplore the failure of this unfortunate listener to see, in it, the explanation of the mysterious Divine Love (Bhakti), contained in the Commandment of the *Bṛhadāraṇyaka upaniṣad* (*Maitreyi Brāhmaṇa*, 44) to the effect that the Lord is to be lovingly, intensely meditated upon.




## 1.4.1
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அம்சிறைய மட நாராய்! அளியத்தாய்! நீயும் நின்  
அம்சிறைய சேவலுமாய் ஆஆ என்று எனக்கு அருளி  
வெம்சிறைப் புள் உயர்த்தார்க்கு என் விடு தூதாய்ச் சென்றக்கால்

**English translation of verse 1.4.1:**

Ye young, sympathetic Stork, with pretty plumes, taking pity on poor me, go with your male partner and deliver my message to the Lord on whose banner Is (Garuḍa) that bird with formidable plumes; If perchance He puts you in prison tough, what does it matter if you were to suffer on my behalf?

**Notes**

\(i\) The white wading birds, stork, crane and heron employed by the Āḻvār as emissaries to God, signify the preceptors, absolutely pure, in and out, standing four-square against the temptations of worldly life, just like these birds with tremendous staying powers, taking up firm positions in the watersheds, coolly resisting the onslaught of the waves.[^1]

\(ii\) It may be noted that the help of the male stork is solicited through the female, following the imperative need for seeking the Lord through the good offices of the Divine Mother, the grand Intercessor between God and man.

[^1]:  Aphorism 154, Ācārya hṛdayam.

\(iii\) Putting the birds in prison should not be taken literally and, in fact, it is most unlikely that the Lord would ever do so, It would indeed be worse than putting them in the toughest prison if He just remained cold and indifferent and would not even look at them, an experience comparable with that of the Princes not getting fed when hunger pinches them.





## 1.4.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

என் செய்ய தாமரைக்கண் பெருமானார்க்கு என் தூதாய்  
என் செய்யும் உரைத்தக்கால்? இனக் குயில்காள் நீர் அலிரே?  
முன் செய்த முழுவினையால் திருவடிக்கீழ்க் குற்றேவல்  
முன் செய்ய முயலாதேன் அகல்வதுவோ? விதியினமே.

eṉ ceyya tāmaraikkaṇ perumāṉārkku eṉ tūtāy  
eṉ ceyyum uraittakkāl? iṉak kuyilkāḷ nīr alirē?  
muṉ ceyta muḻuviṉaiyāl tiruvaṭikkīḻk kuṟṟēval  
muṉ ceyya muyalātēṉ akalvatuvō? vitiyiṉamē.

**Preamble:**

The love-intoxicated Āḻvār beckoned the stork pair, in the preceding stanza, to carry a message to the Lord but the contents of the message are now revealed by him to a band of Kōels, This kind of confusion only reveals the intensity of the Āḻvār’s God-love, the ecstatic imbalance of mind.

**English translation of verse 1.4.2:**

Oh, ye happy band of Kōels, what will unto ye happen If you conveyed my message to my lotus-eyed Lord? Well, aren’t you the familiar lot? should it be decreed That I, who, from His service, did all these days abstain because of my past sins, be still kept away from His feet?

**Notes**

\(i\) There are many points of comparison between the Kōels and the Ācāryas (preceptors).[^1]

\(ii\) Here is an interesting anecdote to drive home the point that our accumulated sins cannot be washed off by our own efforts and that it is only the Lord’s spontaneous grace that can cut the gordian knot and absolve us. Kōḷari Āḻvān and Teṟkāḷvāṉ, two residents of the famous pilgrim centre, Tirukkōṭṭiyūr, in the South, met on an auspicious day, at a bathing ghat. The former demanded of the latter to wash off his sins by taking a dip in the sacred tank. Sharp came the rejoinder from the latter: “Think not, friend, that mv sins will be washed merely by dipping in these waters once or twice. Unless the grace of Lord Saumya Nārāyaṇa (the presiding Deity of the place) descends on me and the discus in His hand destroys all my sins, all my personal exertions will be of no avail.” Śrī Parāśara Bhaṭṭar, who happened to overhear the conversation was thence forward well impressed with Teṟkāḻvāṉ about whom he had no high opinion before, on a mere superficial estimate.

[^1]:  See aphorism 153 of Ācārya Hṛdayam, wherein other birds such as parrots, peacocks have also been brought in.





## 1.4.3
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

விதியினால் பெடை மணக்கும் மென்நடைய அன்னங்காள்!  
மதியினால் குறள் மாணாய் உலகு இரந்த கள்வர்க்கு  
மதியிலேன் வல் வினையே மாளாதோ? என்று ஒருத்தி  
மதி எல்லாம் உள் கலங்கி மயங்குமால் என்னீரே!

matiyilēṉ val viṉaiyē māḷātō? eṉṟu orutti  
mati ellām uḷ kalaṅki mayaṅkumāl eṉṉīrē!

**English translation of verse 1.4.3:**

You lucky pair of swans, with gentle gait, go and tell Him who, as the midget (Vāmaṉa), covertly got a donation of the worlds, that here lies one, whose sins are inexhaustible, in a terrible state of mental imbalance.

**Notes**

\(i\) *Lucky pair of swans or lucky Āḻvār?*

It is not so much the felicity of the swans that they remain duly mated, enjoying conjugal bliss, as the luck of the Āḻvār himself. But for their lucky state of existence they would not have been available now for employment by the Āḻvār. Although Śrī Rāma was bemoaning his separation from Sītā, he felt greatly relieved after he got Sugrīva restored to his wife and Kingdom. Even so, the Āḻvār deems himself lucky to see the swans in a happy state.

\(ii\) The swans are briefed by the Āḻvār to tell the Lord that the sins of the Āḻvār are inexhaustible and that His redemptive grace alone can deliver the goods, in case the Lord insisted that the Āḻvār should first liquidate his sins and then only join Him.

\(iii\) *Third line*: ‘*here lies one*’: It is hardly necessary to disclose the name of this one by way of identification for the Lord jolly well knew His victim as none other than poor Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī, reduced to this critical state by their erstwhile union—




## 1.4.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

என் நீர்மை கண்டு இரங்கி இது தகாது என்னாத  
என் நீல முகில் வண்ணற்கு என் சொல்லி யான் சொல்லுகேனோ?  
நன் நீர்மை இனி அவர்கண் தங்காது என்று ஒரு வாய்ச்சொல்  
நன் நீல மகன்றில்காள்! நல்குதிரோ? நல்கீரோ?

eṉ nīrmai kaṇṭu iraṅki itu takātu eṉṉāta  
eṉ nīla mukil vaṇṇaṟku eṉ colli yāṉ collukēṉō?  
naṉ nīrmai iṉi avarkaṇ taṅkātu eṉṟu oru vāyccol  
naṉ nīla makaṉṟilkāḷ! nalkutirō? nalkīrō?

**Preamble:**

Seeing that Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī was commissioning several birds, a few blue-tinted Aṉṟil (Cakravāka) birds approached her. as if to enquire whether they could also be of service to her. But the dejected lover that she was, she was struck down by the futility of sending a message to the Lord who remained aloof despite an intimate knowledge of her plight, her inordinate love for Him, during their erstwhile union and failed to see the injustice of the present separation. And yet, she asked the blue birds to apprise her blue-hued Lord of her precarious condition, with little or no chance of survival.

**English translation of verse 1.4.4:**

Ye Aṉṟil birds of sapphire hue!  
Tell Him I am about to die, will you?  
What have I to tell my cloud-hued Lord,  
Who relents not, having seen how I fared  
(During our union), and sees not, on his part  
‘Tis most unjust, from me to depart?

**Note**

When Sri Parāśara Bhaṭṭar was discoursing on this song, a Tamil Scholar contended that the expression, “having seen my plight”, in the first line (original text) should be ‘having heard of my plight’. His doubt was how, when they had already been locked in the joy of union, could God, one of the pair, see the signs of pain of the other, after separation. To this, Bhaṭṭar replied: “Don’t you know what the Tamil Savant Tiruvaḷḷuvar has said? The lady-love lay in tight embrace with her lover but, now and then, they got a little unlocked while turning on their sides; this slight distance between them was enough to make her lose the colour on her skin, a decolouration resulting from the gloom of separation! Again, in the poems of ‘*Kuṟuntokai*’ it has been said, whereever, wherever the lover touched, there, there, a flush of colour arose; wherever, wherever the touch had ceased, there, there, the colour sank. The scholar could at once realise that the message in question only reminds the Lord of what He had Himself noticed during His erstwhile union with Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī.




## 1.4.5
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நல்கித் தான் காத்து அளிக்கும் பொழில் ஏழும்; வினையேற்கே  
நல்கத் தான் ஆகாதோ? நாரணனைக் கண்டக்கால்  
மல்கு நீர்ப் புனல் படப்பை இரை தேர் வண் சிறு குருகே!  
மல்கு நீர்க் கண்ணேற்கு ஓர் வாசகம் கொண்டு அருளாயே.

nalkit tāṉ kāttu aḷikkum poḻil ēḻum; viṉaiyēṟkē  
nalkat tāṉ ākātō? nāraṇaṉaik kaṇṭakkāl  
malku nīrp puṉal paṭappai irai tēr vaṇ ciṟu kurukē!  
malku nīrk kaṇṇēṟku ōr vācakam koṇṭu aruḷāyē.

**Preamble**

Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī begs of a heron to convey the following message to her beloved Lord:

> “It matters not if I rot here, away from Him. But He is Nārāyaṇa who,
> by the very implication of that name, resides in all beings and
> sustains them all, unsought and unsolicited, with no exception
> whatsoever. Even the solitary exclusion of myself from the scope of
> His benevolent protection will jeopardise His position of eminence,
> His very name. It behoves Him, therefore, to avert this calamity.”

**English translation of verse 1.4.5:**

Ye little lovely heron, seeking food in water-logged flower gardens,  
When you behold Nāraṇaṉ, the sole sustainer of the worlds seven,  
Will you deign to tell Him that here is one,  
With tearful eyes, a sinner He can’t throw down,  
And bring back any reply He chooses to send on?

**Notes**

\(i\) *Line* 4: *With tearful eyes*: Tears welling up and filling the eyes of the Āḻvār would, as it were, serve as an identification mark for him, whether in a state of separation from or union with the Lord. In the former case it would be tears of grief and in the latter, tears of Joy.

\(ii\) When a doubt was expressed as to how the Saints, soaked in God-love, could address the senseless birds to carry messages to God, the illustrious Nampiḷḷai replied: In affairs of love to God, even storks and stones can serve as messengers, albeit the party at the other end is as exalted as Sītā, the crown jewel of Janaka’s clan. On one occasion, Parāśara Bhaṭṭar was informed of the death of a low-caste devotee in such ordinary language as “he has breathed his last.” Bhaṭṭar at once admonished his informant and said that the news should have been worded as: “He bade farewell here to go and join the ranks of the celestials in Heaven.” He added that caste is of no account, when good men go to God and so also, when messengers are for God, they may be even stones and plants, not to talk of the animate birds.

\(iii\) *Line* 4: ‘*a sinner He cannot throw down*’: “Having roused my appetite for Him, where there was none before, could He now give me up on account of my past sins? Could He who, as Nārāyaṇa, extends protection to one and all (universal), give up His chosen ones like me? Have I sinned to the extent of making even the oceanic water go dry as it is being pumped out?




## 1.4.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அருளாத நீர் அருளி அவர் ஆவி துவராமுன்  
அருள் ஆழிப் புட்கடவீர் அவர் வீதி ஒருநாள் என்று  
அருள் ஆழி அம்மானைக் கண்டக்கால் இது சொல்லி  
அருள் ஆழி வரி வண்டே! யாமும் என் பிழைத்தோமே?

aruḷāta nīr aruḷi avar āvi tuvarāmuṉ  
aruḷ āḻip puṭkaṭavīr avar vīti orunāḷ eṉṟu  
aruḷ āḻi ammāṉaik kaṇṭakkāl itu colli  
aruḷ āḻi vari vaṇṭē! yāmum eṉ piḻaittōmē?

**English translation of verse 1.4.6:**

You bee, with lovely hoops! if you meet my gracious Lord,  
Pray tell Him, although He didn’t relent thus far, He should  
His grace on me shed, ere life from me departs,  
And just pass some day through this street,  
Mounting the gracious bird (Garuḍa); I shall then steal  
A glance at Him. Oh! what is my fault  
(That He against me His heart should steel)?

**Note**

In the preceding stanza, the Lord was advised against imperilling His position as Nārāyaṇa. On second thoughts, the Āḻvār now apprehends the frightful possibility of the Lord staying away from him, choosing the lesser of the two evils, the greater one being contamination by the Āḻvār. Here then is a compromise formula—the Lord, being an ocean of grace, will certainly shed His grace on the Āḻvār also, the sooner the better, that is, ere his life ebbs out; even the simple gesture of His passing through the street where the Āḻvār lives, not often, but just one day, will do. The gracious Garuḍa could certainly oblige the Āḻvār and bring the Lord over here on his shoulders. This was precisely the message conveyed by Sītā to Śrī Rāma through Hanumān. Here is also a painful contrast, Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī, separated from her beloved Lord, undergoing all the pangs of mental torture experienced by Śrī Rāma after the abduction of Sītā. The Āḻvār now ruminates and keeps guessing whether his languishing like this without enduring his lot patiently, would be adjudged as his fault. But then, he would also recollect that Śrī Rāma fared no better when apart from Sīta.




## 1.4.7
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

என்பு இழை கோப்பது போலப் பனி வாடை ஈர்கின்றது  
என் பிழையே நினைந்தருளி அருளாத திருமாலார்க்கு  
என் பிழைத்தாள் திருவடியின் தகவினுக்கு என்று ஒரு வாய்ச்சொல்  
என்பிழைக்கும்? இளங் கிளியே! யான் வளர்த்த நீ அலையே?

eṉpu iḻai kōppatu pōlap paṉi vāṭai īrkiṉṟatu  
eṉ piḻaiyē niṉaintaruḷi aruḷāta tirumālārkku  
eṉ piḻaittāḷ tiruvaṭiyiṉ takaviṉukku eṉṟu oru vāyccol  
eṉpiḻaikkum? iḷaṅ kiḷiyē! yāṉ vaḷartta nī alaiyē?

**English translation of verse 1.4.7:**

Here am I, tormented by the spine-chilling blast.  
Ye young parrot, ain’t you the one I reared.  
What’ll go wrong with you, if you went and enquired  
Of ‘Tirumāl’, who looks solely on my faults  
And sheds not His grace on me, what is precisely  
My fault that admits not His clemency?

**Note**

This is the key stanza of this decad. The messages sent in this decad, keep in the forefront the Lord’s noble trait of forgiveness (aparādha sahatvaṃ). If the Lord is not prepared to concede even the simple request (as in the preceding stanza) of some day passing through the street where the Āḻvār lives, alienated by his shortcomings, the question is now asked, what has happened to His accredited trait of forgiveness, His boundless grace, avidly gorging all our sins. In the inimitable language of ‘Iṭu’ the Āḻvār queries, “My Lord, have I obstructed the influx of your sweet grace, through over-indulgence in genuflections and circumambu-lations?”




## 1.4.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நீயலையே ? சிறு பூவாய்! நெடுமாலார்க்கு என் தூதாய்  
நோய் எனது நுவல் என்ன, நுவலாதே இருந்தொழிந்தாய்  
சாயலொடு மணி மாமை தளர்ந்தேன் நான் இனி உனது-  
வாய் அலகில் இன் அடிசில் வைப்பாரை நாடாயே.

nīyalaiyē ? ciṟu pūvāy! neṭumālārkku eṉ tūtāy  
nōy eṉatu nuval eṉṉa, nuvalātē iruntoḻintāy  
cāyaloṭu maṇi māmai taḷarntēṉ nāṉ iṉi uṉatu-  
vāy alakil iṉ aṭicil vaippārai nāṭāyē.

**English translation of verse 1.4.8:**

Young Pūvāy, you didn’t respond to my appeal  
That you should unto Neṭumāl (my Lord) go and reveal  
My pangs of separation, but quietly lingered on;  
And now that I am sinking, my hue and grace gone,  
You shall depart hence and seek those who, thy bill.  
With tiny bits of delicious food can fill.

**Notes**

\(i\) ‘Pūvai’ is a nice-looking, tiny bird.

\(ii\) Here is a thrilling anecdote. With declining health, Peria Tirumalai Nampi, one of the five Preceptors of Śrī Rāmānuja, became too feeble to offer the diurnal worship to the household Deity-Lord Kṛṣṇa, given the pet name of ‘*The little one dancing for butter*’. And so, one day, drawing aside the drapery that hung before the Deity, he prostrated and recited the last two lines of this particular song (as in the original text), the gist of which has been given above, in the last three lines.




## 1.4.9
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நாடாத மலர் நாடி நாள்தோறும் நாரணன் தன்  
வாடாத மலர் அடிக்கீழ் வைக்கவே வகுக்கின்று  
வீடாடி வீற்றிருத்தல் வினை அற்றது என் செய்வதோ?  
ஊடாடு பனி வாடாய்! உரைத்து ஈராய் எனது உடலே.

nāṭāta malar nāṭi nāḷtōṟum nāraṇaṉ taṉ  
vāṭāta malar aṭikkīḻ vaikkavē vakukkiṉṟu  
vīṭāṭi vīṟṟiruttal viṉai aṟṟatu eṉ ceyvatō?  
ūṭāṭu paṉi vāṭāy! uraittu īrāy eṉatu uṭalē.

**English translation of verse 1.4.9:**

You biting blast, ever on the move, enquire of Nāraṇaṉ, my Lord,  
Why (my limbs) for diurnal service at His floral feet ordained,  
Are this felicity denied and in melancholy steeped;  
If from Him, no favourable reply you obtain.  
Better (come and) split my body into twain.

**Notes**

\(i\) The chill blast, inflicting severe pain on Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī, like unto the king’s executioners torturing the subjects found guilty of high treason, is addressed by her as follows:

> “You see me deep down in dejection, due to long separation from my
> Lord and it is my grievous misfortune that, in such a state, I abstain
> from the stipulated daily service, such as gathering choice flowers
> and placing them reverently at the ever-fresh lotus feet of the Lord,
> etc. You had better go and ask Him how this has come to pass. If,
> however, He feels disinclined to take service from me, I beg of you,
> taking your feet in my hands, to finish me off altogether and thus put
> an end to this insipid and futile existence”.

\(ii\) The wind is the chief sustainer of life and appropriately symbolises the Ācārya (Preceptor).




## 1.4.10
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

உடல் ஆழிப் பிறப்பு வீடு உயிர் முதலா முற்றுமாய்க்  
கடல் ஆழி நீர் தோற்றி அதனுள்ளே கண்வளரும்  
அடல் ஆழி அம்மானைக் கண்டக்கால் இது சொல்லி  
விடல் ஆழி மட நெஞ்சே! வினையோம் ஒன்றாம் அளவே.

uṭal āḻip piṟappu vīṭu uyir mutalā muṟṟumāyk

aṭal āḻi ammāṉaik kaṇṭakkāl itu colli  
viṭal āḻi maṭa neñcē! viṉaiyōm oṉṟām aḷavē.

**English translation of verse 1.4.10:**

Oh, my fickle mind, ‘tis our birthright to serve the Lord,  
Go to Him, holding the bright discus and reclining in the deep sea,  
The Architect of all created worlds, and let Him see  
Our sad plight; leave Him not till unto Him we get restored.

**Note**

When the details of service unto the Lord were spelt out by the Āḻvār in the preceding stanza, his mind, bent upon such service, was about to slip out of the body. It is held by some that the Āḻvār requested his mind not to get parted till stability with the Lord was attained. Being, however, a decad where the Āḻvār sends errands, it would be more appropriate to say that he sent his mind also on such an errand, briefing it not to leave the Lord till He eventually deigns to get restored to the Āḻvār.




## 1.4.11
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அளவு இயன்ற ஏழ் உலகத்தவர் பெருமான் கண்ணனை  
வள வயல் சூழ் வண் குருகூர்ச் சடகோபன் வாய்ந்து உரைத்த  
அளவு இயன்ற அந்தாதி ஆயிரத்துள் இப் பத்தின்  
வள உரையால் பெறலாகும் வான் ஓங்கு பெரு வளமே. (2)

aḷavu iyaṉṟa ēḻ ulakattavar perumāṉ kaṇṇaṉai

aḷavu iyaṉṟa antāti āyirattuḷ ip pattiṉ  
vaḷa uraiyāl peṟalākum vāṉ ōṅku peru vaḷamē. (2)

**English translation of verse 1.4.11:**

Those that just recite these sweet songs ten  
Out of the metrically perfect thousand, lovingly composed by Caṭakōpaṉ,  
Chief of rich and fertile Kurukūr, in adoration  
Of Kaṇṇaṉ, Lord of the denizens of the worlds seven,  
Will attain the Supreme bliss of service in Heaven.

**Notes**

\(i\) In the preceding decad, expatiating on the Supreme Lord’s easy accessibility, the Saint wanted to abide in the proximate Kṛṣṇa avatāra but failure to achieve it led him to send errands to the Lord in this decad. Having seen the intensity of the love of Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī and her yearning for Divine presence, too deep for words, as revealed in the preceding ten stanzas, the Lord could not stay back any longer, except at the risk of the Āḻvār being lost to this world altogether. The fact that the Lord has been restored to the Saint can be inferred from the very tenor of this stanza, where the Lord is being extolled as the Chief of all the worlds, thus presenting His overlordship and easy-accessibility, side by side.

\(ii\) Even the mere recital of the text of these stanzas, without so much as delving into their spirit and meaning, will, it is claimed, shoot one up, from the bottom-most depths of worldly existence to the highest state of Service unto the Lord in the High Heavens.
