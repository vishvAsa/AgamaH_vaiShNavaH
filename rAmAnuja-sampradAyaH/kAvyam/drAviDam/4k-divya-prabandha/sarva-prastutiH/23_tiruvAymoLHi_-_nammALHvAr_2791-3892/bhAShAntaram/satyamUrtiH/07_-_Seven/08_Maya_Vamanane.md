## 00 Intro7.8
In the last decad, the Alvar felt tormented by the mental vision of the Lord’s limbs, one after the other, rousing his appetite for God-enjoyment all the more. The Lord would not, however, fulfil the Āḻvār’s aspiration even now and is obviously waiting for the appropriate moment of consummation. The Āḻvār knows the Lord’s mind all right but still he is egged on by the exuberance of his God-love to crave for immediate union. So great was his ardour that non-fulfilment thereof should have normally resulted in his immediate extinction. He was, however, still kept alive, much to his surprise and he enquired of the Lord how exactly He enacted this wonder. “Well,” said the Lord “this is not the only wonder wrought by Me, better behold My kaleidoscopic cosmic wealth”. The Lord thus exhibited unto the Āḻvār many wonders, as against just one on which he sought elucidation. Overawed by the amazing magnitude of the Lord’s wealth and wonders, even as sage Akrūra beheld with dismay the Divine Brothers (Balarāma and Kṛṣṇa) inside the running water of river Yamunā, as well as on the river bank, the Āḻvār voices forth in this decad, his mental reactions to the wonderful phenomena in front of him. It might be recalled that the Lord had displayed unto the Āḻvār His cosmic wealth and splendour earlier also in III-4 and VI-3. In III-4, however, the Āḻvār just didn’t know where to begin and what to say, unable to express himself with any degree of precision; in VI-3, the Lord revealed His extra-ordinary capacity to/achieve the impossible and compose, with perfect ease, the incompatibles, the opposites, within His fold. And now, we see an over-awed Āḻvār attempting to describe the wonderful phenomena before him and seeking clarification from the Lord in respect of the bewildering complexities, baffling intellectual comprehension.




## 7.8.1
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மாயா! வாமனனே! மதுசூதா நீ அருளாய்,  
தீயாய் நீர் ஆய் நிலன் ஆய் விசும்பு ஆய் கால் ஆய்,  
தாயாய் தந்தையாய் மக்களாய் மற்றுமாய் முற்றுமாய்,  
நீயாய் நீ நின்றவாறு இவை என்ன நியாயங்களே! (2)

māyā! vāmaṉaṉē! matucūtā nī aruḷāy,  
tīyāy nīr āy nilaṉ āy vicumpu āy kāl āy,  
tāyāy tantaiyāy makkaḷāy maṟṟumāy muṟṟumāy,  
nīyāy nī niṉṟavāṟu ivai eṉṉa niyāyaṅkaḷē! (2)

**English translation of verse 7.8.1:**

Pray, reveal unto me Your facets many, oh, Vāmaṉā!  
My wondrous Lord, You slew the demons, (Madhu and Kaiṭabha),  
You are the elements five and of us all, the mother, the father  
And the progeny too and all else one can, by name, utter,  
As well as those one can’t utter; I can’t comprehened how You are  
Your Form unique and also stand in all things everywhere!

**Notes:**

Many indeed are the wonders performed by the Lord. As Vāmana, the Midget, He went to Mahābali, as soon as He emerged, compelled his attention, got the donation of land of three strides, expanded Himself and spanned the entire universe; He crushed to death, the demons Madhu and Kaitabha under His thigh; He is at once fire and water, father and mother and their progeny as well, a unique position, none else can hold. Fire cannot be water and water cannot be fire; mother is different from father and the children are altogether separate entities. Well, all these pertain to His attribute of being all-pervading, His cosmic or universal form. And yet, the Āḻvār could enjoy, with perfect mental equanimity the Lord’s resplendent personal Form, as in Heaven, the perennial spring of nectar which the denizens over there drink deep all the time, as well as His universal Form, permeating all things, all over. This is because His immanence is a matter of superb wonder which keeps the Saint aghast.




## 7.8.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அங்கண் மலர்த் தண் துழாய்முடி அச்சுதனே! அருளாய்,  
திங்களும் ஞாயிறும் ஆய் செழும் பல் சுடர் ஆய் இருள் ஆய்,  
பொங்கு பொழி மழை ஆய் புகழ் ஆய் பழி ஆய் பின்னும்நீ,  
வெங்கண்வெங் கூற்றமும் ஆம் இவை என்ன விசித்திரமே!

aṅkaṇ malart taṇ tuḻāymuṭi accutaṉē! aruḷāy,  
tiṅkaḷum ñāyiṟum āy ceḻum pal cuṭar āy iruḷ āy,  
poṅku poḻi maḻai āy pukaḻ āy paḻi āy piṉṉumnī,  
veṅkaṇveṅ kūṟṟamum ām ivai eṉṉa vicittiramē!

**English translation of verse 7.8.2:**

Oh, Accuta, wearing on Your lovely locks tuḷacī garland cool,  
With honey-studded flowers, pray let me know what the wonder is,  
That You are the Sun, the Moon, the bright stars in broad expanse,  
And darkness too, the rains torrential, fame and ill-fame as well,  
And then, the unrelenting Death with cruel eyes.

**Notes:**

\(i\) Towards the end of the last song, the Āḻvār contemplated the Lord’s exquisite personal Form. That has led him on to the description of the tuḷacī-bedecked locks of the Lord in this song.

\(ii\) The Sun generates enervating heat while the Moon spreads its radiance, cool and refreshing; the stars and planets affect people both ways, for good and bad; darkness, the antithesis of light, provides a facile cover for the lewd and the thief; the rains help to raise the crops to feed the lives of creatures; the Lord directs and controls all these and He is also the much-sought-after praise as well as the disdainful opprobrium; when the people in different worlds, commit unpardonable moral transgressions, He functions, as the unrelenting Agent of dissolution of the universe, being Yama’s Yama. ‘Mṛtyu’ (Yama, the deity of death) is like unto the pickles in the eating plate. The pickles, with their appetising flavour and agreeable taste, serve as elective media for consuming food with great relish and ultimately, what remains of the pickles in the plate, is also consumed. Yama, functioning as the Lord’s appointed agent for dissolution, is also consumed by the Lord likewise, at the end of each Epoch, marked by the great Deluge. The upaniṣads say: “Mṛtyur yasya upasecanaṃ”. The Āḻvār seeks clarification from the Lord how He could at once be all these things notwithstanding their mutual incompatibility.






## 7.8.3
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

சித்திரத் தேர் வலவா! திருச் சக்கரத்தாய்! அருளாய்,  
எத்தனை ஓர் உகமும் அவை ஆய் அவற்றுள் இயலும்,  
ஒத்த ஓண் பல் பொருள்கள் உலப்பு இல்லன ஆய் வியவு ஆய்,  
வித்தகத்தாய் நிற்றி நீ இவை என்ன விடமங்களே!

cittirat tēr valavā! tiruc cakkarattāy! aruḷāy,  
ettaṉai ōr ukamum avai āy avaṟṟuḷ iyalum,  
otta ōṇ pal poruḷkaḷ ulappu illaṉa āy viyavu āy,  
vittakattāy niṟṟi nī ivai eṉṉa viṭamaṅkaḷē!

**English translation of verse 7.8.3:**

Do unto me reveal, oh, marvellous Charioteer,  
Wielding the discus lovely, the great wonder You are,  
Holding the cycle of Yugas and their occurrences internal,  
The lovely things, vast and varied, all under Your control.

**Notes:**

The thing mentioned last in the preceding song was ‘dissolution’. Speaking about dissolution, the Āḻvār would seem to have been reminded about the riddance by Lord Kṛṣṇa, of the entire mass of unwholesome burden on Mother Earth, through the annihilation of the armies in the great battle at Kurukṣetra. It is well known to every Student of Mahā-Bhārata that Lord Kṛṣṇā was the pivotal Figure around whom the whole thing revolved. The great Bhīṣma was heard to say that he would have routed the Pāṇḍavas and their soldiers, with just one arrow, but for Lord Kṛṣṇa functioning as Arjuna’s Charioteer, plying it in an amazing manner. When Arjuna’s horses were paralysed with thirst, the divine Charioteer could perform the miracle of getting water from the depth of the barren soil, by sending a shaft deep inside. Seeing this miracle, the monarchs, ranged opposite, sank down to the bottom-most depth of despair. And then, the Lord’s discus could shut out the evening Sun and induct artificial sun-set, which lulled Jayadratha, the brother-in-law of Duryodhana into a sense of false security and made him fall an easy prey to Arjuna’s revengeful arrow. Arjuna had sworn that he would avenge the death of his son, Abhimanyu, by killing his slayer, Jayadratha before sun-set that day. Mistaking the artificial sun-set induced by Kṛṣṇa by holding His discus aloft and shutting the Sun out for the real one, Jayadratha came out of his hiding place, feeling quite safe, when the Lord suddenly withdrew the discus and the sun shone again, making it easy for Arjuna to kill the enemy instantly. As regards this episode, there could arise a legitimate doubt, how the discus which is itself million times more radiant than the Sun. could, by merely shutting out the Sun, introduce darkness—‘Śudharśanaṃ Bhāskara Koṭi tulyaṃ’. Well, this is yet another miracle of Lord Kṛṣṇa.

The cycle of Yugas has been going on and each yuga is characterised by a special feature, which is its key or dominant note. And then, the created world of staggering diversity and strange incompatibility is held together by the wondrous Lord betokening His Omnipotence. The Āḻvār cannot but marvel at this.




## 7.8.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கள் அவிழ் தாமரைக்கண் கண்ணனே! எனக்கு ஒன்று அருளாய்,  
உள்ளதும் இல்லதும் ஆய் உலப்பு இல்லன ஆய் வியவு ஆய்,  
வெள்ளத் தடம் கடலுள் விட நாகு அணைமேல் மருவி,  
உள்ளப் பல் யோகு செய்தி இவை என்ன உபாயங்களே!

kaḷ aviḻ tāmaraikkaṇ kaṇṇaṉē! eṉakku oṉṟu aruḷāy,  
uḷḷatum illatum āy ulappu illaṉa āy viyavu āy,  
veḷḷat taṭam kaṭaluḷ viṭa nāku aṇaimēl maruvi,  
uḷḷap pal yōku ceyti ivai eṉṉa upāyaṅkaḷē!

**English translation of verse 7.8.4:**

Oh, Kaṇṇā, the lotus-eyed, pray clarify a thing unto me not clear,  
The Master Supreme of all things and beings that You are—  
The non-changing Individuals in many an assorted grade  
And the ever-changing things, vast and varied; in the Milk-ocean broad;  
You keep pondering, reposing on Your pcisonous-serpent bed;  
What are the plans up Your sleeves indeed?

**Notes:**

\(i\) The Āḻvār seems to question the Lord whether even He has to indulge in this kind of contemplation, despite His omni- science and omnipotence and seeks clarification from Him as to what precisely He means to hit upon, as a result of such deep thinking in a state of Yoga-nidhrā (the highest form of activity).

\(ii\) The sentient beings (the Jīvas) do not change at all, only the material outer cloak, the body changes; on the other hand, the non-sentient things are ephemeral, in the sense that they undergo frequent changes of state. The Lord is the great ordainer of both the species. Innumerable indeed are the Jivas, each one with its own propensities, accumulated wisdom and load of ‘Karma’ (deeds good and bad), unless the Jiva is God-bent, the Lord cannot possibly pull it up and naturally He keeps pondering over the ways and means of resuscitation of the Jivas.




## 7.8.5
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

பாசங்கள் நீக்கி என்னை உனக்கே அறக் கொண்டிட்டு, நீ  
வாச மலர்த் தண் துழாய்முடி மாயவனே! அருளாய்,  
காயமும் சீவனும் ஆய் கழிவு ஆய் பிறப்பு ஆய் பின்னும்நீ,  
மாயங்கள் செய்துவைத்தி இவை என்ன மயக்குக்களே!

pācaṅkaḷ nīkki eṉṉai uṉakkē aṟak koṇṭiṭṭu, nī  
vāca malart taṇ tuḻāymuṭi māyavaṉē! aruḷāy,  
kāyamum cīvaṉum āy kaḻivu āy piṟappu āy piṉṉumnī,  
māyaṅkaḷ ceytuvaitti ivai eṉṉa mayakkukkaḷē!

**English translation of verse 7.8.5:**

My wondrous Lord, wearing tuḷaci, cool and fragrant, on Your locks fine!  
You rid me of all things unwholesome and made me Your vassal  
The body that binds and the bound souls, their growth and decline  
Are all by You controlled and yet, You have kept me still  
In this body foul, what glamour You find in it, please tell.

**Notes:**

This is the key-song, providing the preamble for this decad. The Saint asks the Lord to elucidate the riddle of His keeping him, in this material body, in mundane surroundings, even after weaning him away from the worldly things and engendering in him inordinate God-love, brooking no further delay in its consummation. With all this special equipment provided unto him by the Lord Himself, the Āḻvār felt sanguine that the Lord had admitted him into His sweet fold. Prolongation of his stay in this abode of dark nescience, however, makes him doubt the Lord’s intentions and hence the clarification now sought.




## 7.8.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மயக்கா! வாமனனே! மதி ஆம் வண்ணம் ஒன்று அருளாய்,  
அயர்ப்பு ஆய் தேற்றமும் ஆய் அழல் ஆய் குளிர் ஆய் வியவு ஆய்,  
வியப்பு ஆய் வென்றிகள் ஆய் வினை ஆய் பயன் ஆய் பின்னும்நீ,  
துயக்கு ஆய் நீ நின்றவாறு இவை என்ன துயரங்களே!

mayakkā! vāmaṉaṉē! mati ām vaṇṇam oṉṟu aruḷāy,  
ayarppu āy tēṟṟamum āy aḻal āy kuḷir āy viyavu āy,  
viyappu āy veṉṟikaḷ āy viṉai āy payaṉ āy piṉṉumnī,  
tuyakku āy nī niṉṟavāṟu ivai eṉṉa tuyaraṅkaḷē!

**English translation of verse 7.8.6:**

Pray vouchsafe unto me clarity, oh, Vāmaṉa, of bewitching beauty,  
The individuals caught up in the vortex of varying experiences,  
Heat and cold, wonder and the wonderful, confusion and clarity  
Victory and defeat, act good and bad and their consequences.  
Are all by You ordained; but then, immense are the sorrows  
Caused unto Your Subjects by such (sporting) activities of Yours.

**Notes:**

The Saint enquires of the Lord whether He would keep even His votaries, unto Him solely devoted, bewildered like the demoniac Mahābali. May be, it is all part of His līlā (Sport) but what a lot of distress it brings on His subjects!




## 7.8.7
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

துயரங்கள் செய்யும் கண்ணா! சுடர் நீள் முடியாய் அருளாய்,  
துயரம் செய் மானங்கள் ஆய் மதன் ஆகி உகவைகள் ஆய்,  
துயரம் செய் காமங்கள் ஆய் துலை ஆய் நிலை ஆய் நடை ஆய்,  
துயரங்கள் செய்துவைத்தி இவை என்ன சுண்டாயங்களே.

tuyaraṅkaḷ ceyyum kaṇṇā! cuṭar nīḷ muṭiyāy aruḷāy,  
tuyaram cey māṉaṅkaḷ āy mataṉ āki ukavaikaḷ āy,  
tuyaram cey kāmaṅkaḷ āy tulai āy nilai āy naṭai āy,  
tuyaraṅkaḷ ceytuvaitti ivai eṉṉa cuṇṭāyaṅkaḷē.

**English translation of verse 7.8.7:**

Oh, Kaṇṇā, sporting the radiant crown, putting me in g eat distress,  
You set the temptations many and unwholesome desires,  
Elation and lust breeding miseries, before all beings, stationary and mobile,  
Pray let me know why You indulge in such sports vile.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The Lord, proclaimed by the upaniṣads as an inexhaustible fountain of bliss, is addressed by the Saint, in this song, as the Inflictor of miseries. The fact of the matter is that, on visualising the Lord sporting the resplendent crown, the Saint’s longing for communion with Him has been intensified and he feels miserable. This is but the language of the Saints, in such moments of desolation.

\(ii\) The unwholesome desires are those directed towards the enjoyment of sensual pleasures, straying away from God-head and remaining self-centred ‘Sohaṃ’ while the wholesome desires are those centred round God and His devotees (Dāsohaṃ); the former breeds miseries while the latter is blissful.




## 7.8.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

என்ன சுண்டாயங்களால் நின்றிட்டாய் என்னை ஆளும் கண்ணா,  
இன்னது ஓர் தன்மையை என்று உன்னை யாவர்க்கும் தேற்றரியை,  
முன்னிய மூவுலகும் அவை ஆய் அவற்றைப் படைத்து,  
பின்னும் உள்ளாய்! புறத்தாய்! இவை என்ன இயற்கைகளே!

eṉṉa cuṇṭāyaṅkaḷāl niṉṟiṭṭāy eṉṉai āḷum kaṇṇā,  
iṉṉatu ōr taṉmaiyai eṉṟu uṉṉai yāvarkkum tēṟṟariyai,  
muṉṉiya mūvulakum avai āy avaṟṟaip paṭaittu,  
piṉṉum uḷḷāy! puṟattāy! ivai eṉṉa iyaṟkaikaḷē!

**English translation of verse 7.8.8:**

How sportive indeed You are, oh, Kaṇṇā, my Master,  
None can comprehend how and what You are;  
You are the Controller of the worlds three and their Creator,  
And You also pervade them all, in and out, oh, what a power!

**Notes:**

\(i\) The Lord’s sports are many and inscrutable. Even the wisest and the most exalted can hardly plumb the depths of His mysteries, His disposition and dispensation.

\(ii\) The Vedas proclaim that the Lord’s immanence is full and complete, in and out, even inside the minutest object of sub-atomic size, which, of course, baffles intellectual comprehension.




## 7.8.9
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

என்ன இயற்கைகளால் எங்ஙனே நின்றிட்டாய் என் கண்ணா?,  
துன்னு கரசரணம் முதலாக எல்லா உறுப்பும்,  
உன்னு சுவை ஒளி ஊறு ஒலி நாற்றம் முற்றும்நீயே,  
உன்னை உணரவுறில் உலப்பு இல்லை நுணுக்கங்களே.

eṉṉa iyaṟkaikaḷāl eṅṅaṉē niṉṟiṭṭāy eṉ kaṇṇā?,  
tuṉṉu karacaraṇam mutalāka ellā uṟuppum,  
uṉṉu cuvai oḷi ūṟu oli nāṟṟam muṟṟumnīyē,  
uṉṉai uṇaravuṟil ulappu illai nuṇukkaṅkaḷē.

**English translation of verse 7.8.9:**

Oh, Kaṇṇā, my Lord, when one defines You, there’s no end  
To Your intricacies, the mode and manner in which You stand,  
The senses five You control, taste, light and sound,  
Touch and smell to enjoying which the various organs contend.

**Notes:**

The intricate glory of the Lord with its innumerable facets defies description and baffles scrutiny. The deeds performed by the vast multitude of His subjects, with the help of the bodies and limbs dowered on them by Lord, the senses five and their subtle bases, the elements from which they emanate, all these are directed and controlled by the Lord, standing within all things and beings; There is no end to such intricacies.




## 7.8.10
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

இல்லை நுணுக்கங்களே இதனில் பிறிது என்னும் வண்ணம்  
தொல்லை நல் நூலில் சொன்ன உருவும் அருவும் நீயே:  
அல்லித் துழாய் அலங்கல் அணி மார்ப என் அச்சுதனே,  
வல்லது ஓர் வண்ணம் சொன்னால் அதுவே உனக்கு ஆம்வண்ணமே.

illai nuṇukkaṅkaḷē itaṉil piṟitu eṉṉum vaṇṇam  
tollai nal nūlil coṉṉa uruvum aruvum nīyē:  
allit tuḻāy alaṅkal aṇi mārpa eṉ accutaṉē,  
vallatu ōr vaṇṇam coṉṉāl atuvē uṉakku āmvaṇṇamē.

**English translation of verse 7.8.10:**

My Lord, Accyuta, sporting on Your lovely chest a garland of tuḷaci and lotus!  
You inhere in shapely things non-sentient and sentient beings formless,  
(Both in the subtle and gross states), as revealed by Vedas, hoary and immaculate;  
Yet You are just what Your devotees comprehend of You and contemplate.

**Notes:**

Both in the unmanifest (subtle) state and the manifest (gross) state, the Lord is in conjunction with the formless individual souls and the shapely non-sentient things. This is revealed by the Vedas, hoary and authentic. He is also visualised by the Saint, in His unique Form, bedecked with flowers and bejewelled, wielding conch and discus. Even the wisest sages and the most exalted Devas can touch only a fringe of His glory, attributes and cosmic wealth. And yet, the Lord thinks, He is no more than what His devotees comprehend of Him and meditate upon, for He loves them so well.




## 7.8.11
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஆம் வண்ணம் இன்னது ஒன்று என்று அறிவது அரிய அரியை,  
ஆம் வண்ணத்தால் குருகூர்ச் சடகோபன் அறிந்து உரைத்த  
ஆம் வண்ண ஒண் தமிழ்கள் இவை ஆயிரத்துள் இப்பத்தும்,  
ஆம் வண்ணத்தால் உரைப்பார் அமைந்தார் தமக்கு என்றைக்குமே. (2)

ām vaṇṇam iṉṉatu oṉṟu eṉṟu aṟivatu ariya ariyai,  
ām vaṇṇattāl kurukūrc caṭakōpaṉ aṟintu uraitta  
ām vaṇṇa oṇ tamiḻkaḷ ivai āyirattuḷ ippattum,  
ām vaṇṇattāl uraippār amaintār tamakku eṉṟaikkumē. (2)

**English translation of verse 7.8.11:**

Those who chant, as best as they can, these songs ten  
Out of the thousand elegant Tamil songs of Kurukūr Caṭakōpaṉ,  
Revealing the Lord, difficult to comprehend but by him well discerned,  
Will for ever enjoy undiminished, the bliss divine.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The Scriptural texts contain many apparent discrepancies, one text seeming to contradict or be at variance with another and only the devout, blessed by the Lord Himself with clarity of vision and understanding, as in the case of Saint Nāmmāḻvār, can reconcile these apparent discrepancies and get at the Spiritual truths, in their correct perspective, shorn of all doubts, deviations and discrepancies.

\(ii\) Those that recite this decad will enjoy the Āḻvār’s grace and be thus assured of an unbroken enjoyment of eternal Divine bliss, without being put to the necessity of direct supplication to the Lord. As Nampiḷḷai puts it, these chanters do not have to drink water off the Lord’s sleeves.
