## 00 Intro2.7
In the seventh stanza of the last decad, the Āḻvār had mentioned that the Lord’s benevolent grace did not stop with him alone but overflowed its continents and extended to all those connected with him in the preceding and succeeding generations as well. Overwhelmed by this extraordinary benevolence of the Lord the Āḻvār expatiates on it in this decad.

Of the numerous auspicious traits of the Lord extension of His love and care not only to His devotees but all those associated with them, is indeed exemplary.

After Rāvaṇa was slain by Śrī Rāma, Vibhīṣaṇa was called upon to perform the funeral rites of his brother. But then Vibhīṣaṇa demurred, saying that he would not do any such thing for such a great sinner as Rāvaṇa. Śrī Rāma (the very personification of Grace) had, however, no bitterness towards Rāvaṇa and all the bitterness was only on the part of Rāvaṇa, an one-sided affair! Now that Rāvaṇa was dead he would no longer repel Śrī Rāma’s good offices, that is, if Vibhīṣaṇa performed the funeral rites at Śrī Rāma‘s bidding. If Vibhīṣaṇa still demurred and declined to act, Śrī Rāma would do it himself; if Vibhīṣaṇa was a brother unto Rāma, so was Rāvaṇa, as Vibhīṣaṇa’s brother. There are several other instances where the Lord extended the area of His benevolence, bringing within its purview all those associated with His devotees. This is being illustrated in this Tiruvāymoḻi.

The Lord’s twelve principal names, Keśava, Nārāyaṇa etc., are dealt with in these stanzas, in the same order in which these names are recited by the devotees in the course of their diurnal prayers. There are, therefore, 13 stanzas in this decad (12+1 end-song), as against the usual 11 stanzas (10+1 end-stanza).




## 2.7.1
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கேசவன் தமர் கீழ் மேல் எமர் ஏழ் எழு பிறப்பும்,  
மா சதிர் இது பெற்று நம்முடை வாழ்வு வாய்க்கின்றவா,  
ஈசன் என் கருமாணிக்கம் என் செங்கோலக் கண்ணன் விண்ணோர்  
நாயகன், எம் பிரான் எம்மான் நாராயணனாலே.

kēcavaṉ tamar kīḻ mēl emar ēḻ eḻu piṟappum,  
mā catir itu peṟṟu nammuṭai vāḻvu vāykkiṉṟavā,  
īcaṉ eṉ karumāṇikkam eṉ ceṅkōlak kaṇṇaṉ viṇṇōr  
nāyakaṉ, em pirāṉ emmāṉ nārāyaṇaṉālē.

**English translation of verse 2.7.1:**

My delectable blue gem, Master of all,  
Of red-lotus-eyes lovely, Chief of the Celestials,  
Nārāyaṇaṉ, my Lord and Benefactor has elevated  
As *Kēcavā’s* (His) devotees, ail with me associated,  
Seven generations, up and down, how grand  
Is the growth of our spiritual wealth indeed!

**Notes**

\(i\) ‘Kēcava’ yields three meanings, viz,:

> (*a*) One with lovely locks of hair,  
> (*b*) Slayer of Keśi, the demon—Śrī Kṛṣṇa and  
> (*c*) Progenitor of Brahmā and Śiva.

\(ii\) Reference to seven generations, up and down, follows the trend in the Vedic texts.

\(iii\) The spiritual growth resulting from the Lord’s spontaneous grace is indeed astounding; the progress made by our own efforts will but be tiny in comparison.




## 2.7.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நாரணன் முழு ஏழ் உலகுக்கும் நாதன் வேத மயன்,  
காரணம் கிரிசை கருமம் இவை முதல்வன் எந்தை,  
சீர் அணங்கு அமரர் பிறர் பலரும் தொழுது ஏத்த நின்று,  
வாரணத்தை மருப்பு ஒசித்த பிரான் என் மாதவனே.

nāraṇaṉ muḻu ēḻ ulakukkum nātaṉ vēta mayaṉ,  
kāraṇam kiricai karumam ivai mutalvaṉ entai,  
cīr aṇaṅku amarar piṟar palarum toḻutu ētta niṉṟu,  
vāraṇattai maruppu ocitta pirāṉ eṉ mātavaṉē.

**English translation of verse 2.7.2:**

Nāraṇaṉ, the Supreme support of all the worlds,  
Does ordain everything, Cause, effect and action; the Vedas He pervades,  
And is by the exalted Celestials and all else adored;  
Mātavaṇ, who the giant tusker slew, is my beneficent Lord.

**Notes**

\(i\) ‘Nārāyaṇa’, as a Bahuvrīhi compound, brings out the meaning that the Lord is the In-dweller of all things and creatures having name and form:

\(ii\) The Tatpuruṣa compound of the word reveals the Lord as sustaining the whole universe.

\(iii\) ‘*Nāra*’ treats of the objects pervaded by the Lord; One aspect of ‘*ayana*’ spotlights the Lord as the ‘Means’ and another aspect reveals Him as the ‘End’ as well.

\(iv\) Of the two meanings got at above, one emphasises the Lord’s transcendence (paratva) and the other. His Saulabhya (Easy accessibility), vindicated principally through His Avatāras and the connected deeds.




## 2.7.3
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மாதவன் என்றதே கொண்டு என்னை இனி இப்பால் பட்டது,  
யாது அவங்களும் சேர்கொடேன் என்று என்னுள் புகுந்து இருந்து,  
தீது அவம் கெடுக்கும் அமுதம் செந்தாமரைக் கண் குன்றம்,  
கோது அவம் இல் என் கன்னல் கட்டி எம்மான் என் கோவிந்தனே.

mātavaṉ eṉṟatē koṇṭu eṉṉai iṉi ippāl paṭṭatu,  
yātu avaṅkaḷum cērkoṭēṉ eṉṟu eṉṉuḷ pukuntu iruntu,  
tītu avam keṭukkum amutam centāmaraik kaṇ kuṉṟam,  
kōtu avam il eṉ kaṉṉal kaṭṭi emmāṉ eṉ kōvintaṉē.

**English translation of verse 2.7.3:**

‘Mātavaṉ’ is a name by me casually uttered,  
And yet, Kōvintaṉ my Lord, has inside me entered,  
Ridding me of evils, one and all, the lotus-eyed Lord,  
My nectar, Candy flawless, stands like a rock (firm and solid).

**Notes**

\(i\) ‘Madhava’ is the Lord’s name, most intimately associated with the Mother, Lakṣmī, meaning the ‘Consort of Mā’ and, for this reason, most endearing to Him. Śrī Parāśara Bhaṭṭar tells Goddess Raṅganāyakī, enshrined in Śrīraṅgam, that the Lord is dear to the devotees because of Her association with Him (śloka 51 of Śrī guṇaratnakośam [Guṇaratnakośa])

In aphorism 111 of ‘Ācārya Hṛdayam’, the learned author high-lights the Lord’s extra-liberal standards by which He gives us credit for what is known as ‘*ajñāta sukṛta*’ (hidden or unknown merit), such as a casual mention of the word ‘Madhava’ by some one, being treated by the Lord as a pious recital of His name; a mechanical naming of the sacred mountain in the South, known as ‘Tirumāliruñcōḷai malai, as devout remembrance of the sacred pilgrim centre and so on.

\(ii\) Having eradicated all the sins of the Āḻvār, root and branch, the Lord is jubilant, a fact reflected in His effulgent Person. The Lord is free from the twin flaws of (ḷ) expecting anything in return from His beneficiaries and (2) doing good to the devotees for their sake instead of for His own benefit. The candy which we know of, is exposed to two kinds of flaws, namely, use of faulty ingredients and faulty preparation. But the Lord is a flawless candy, which attracted the Āḻvār and kept him wholly absorbed in it.

\(iii\) ‘*Govinda, my Lord*’—The Āḻvār thinks that the Lord incarnated as Kṛṣṇa, (Govinda), only to enthrall him.




## 2.7.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கோவிந்தன் குடக் கூத்தன் கோவலன் என்று என்றே குனித்துத்  
தேவும் தன்னையும் பாடி ஆடத் திருத்தி என்னைக் கொண்டு என்  
பாவம் தன்னையும் பாறக் கைத்து எமர் ஏழ் எழு பிறப்பும்,  
மேவும் தன்மையம் ஆக்கினான் வல்லன் எம்பிரான் விட்டுவே.

kōvintaṉ kuṭak kūttaṉ kōvalaṉ eṉṟu eṉṟē kuṉittut  
tēvum taṉṉaiyum pāṭi āṭat tirutti eṉṉaik koṇṭu eṉ  
pāvam taṉṉaiyum pāṟak kaittu emar ēḻ eḻu piṟappum,  
mēvum taṉmaiyam ākkiṉāṉ vallaṉ empirāṉ viṭṭuvē.

**English translation of verse 2.7.4:**

Kōvintaṉ, the pot-dancer, cowherd, the Supreme Lord,  
So do I His glory sing and dance, by Him enthralled  
And blest, my sins were chased out and those  
With me connected for generations, recipients of His grace,  
He has made; how potent is Viṣṇu, my benefactor great.

**Notes**

\(i\) The Āḻvār is lost in admiration of the immense prowess of Lord Viṣṇu, in redeeming him and placing him on a par with the Evcr-free angels in Heaven (*Nitya Sūrīs*), a literal transformation of a base metal into gold. All his sins destroyed, he has been endowed with a mind steeped in the hilarious enjoyment of the Lord’s glory. His amazing simplicity (*Saulabhya*) as Govinda and His transcendence (*Paratva*), side by side. And what more? All those connected with him, Seven generations, back and forth, have been blest likewise. They have been rendered worthy of His grace, looking upon Him as the Sole Refuge, true *to their essential nature*. Sage Vaśiṣṭa who accompanied Bharata to Chitrakūṭa to persuade Śrī Rāma to get back to Ayodhyā, told Śrī Rāma: ‘ātmānaṃ nāti vartetā’ This literally means ‘Don’t exceed yourself’. Some interpret ‘ātmānaṃ’ as Bharata, dear to Rāma like his own life. Śrī Parāśara Bhaṭṭar, however, interprets it as ‘Don’t exceed or give up your essential nature of doing the bidding of your devotees (āṣṛta pāratantriya)’.

\(ii\) ‘Govinda’ has been repeated twice in Śrī Viṣṇu Sahasranāma, yielding two different meanings, viz. (i) The recipient of praise and (2) The redeemer of the Earth (hidden by an Asura). The better known meaning is one possessing cows. Śrī Kṛṣṇa was coronated as ‘Govinda’ by Devendra, after the former’s glorious protection and preservation of the pastoral life of the whole community *in tact*, by holding aloft Mount Govardhana for a whole week. This is indeed a unique wealth acquired by the Lord, come down to Earth, which cannot be had even in the Eternal Land,. Śrī Vaikuṇṭha.

\(iii\) *Pot-dancing*: Even as the affluent Brahmins resort to the performance of ‘Yāgas’, the Shepherds, in affluence, indulge in sports like pot-dance-with pots piled one over the other, on the head and both the shoulders. The dancers will throw up pots alternately using both hands, without disturbing the equilibrium of the piled-up pots. Lord Kṛṣṇa, as a member of the cowherd community, naturally participated in all such sports and revelled, rather excelled!.




## 2.7.5
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

விட்டு இலங்கு செஞ்சோதித் தாமரை பாதம் கைகள் கண்கள,  
விட்டு இலங்கு கருஞ்சுடர் மலையே திரு உடம்பு,  
விட்டு இலங்கு மதியம் சீர் சங்கு சக்கரம் பரிதி,  
விட்டு இலங்கு முடி அம்மான் மதுசூதனன் தனக்கே.

viṭṭu ilaṅku ceñcōtit tāmarai pātam kaikaḷ kaṇkaḷa,  
viṭṭu ilaṅku karuñcuṭar malaiyē tiru uṭampu,  
viṭṭu ilaṅku matiyam cīr caṅku cakkaram pariti,  
viṭṭu ilaṅku muṭi ammāṉ matucūtaṉaṉ taṉakkē.

**English translation of verse 2.7.5:**

Sporting the majestic crown, exceedingly bright,  
My lord, Matucūtaṉ’s eyes, hands and feet are very smart.  
Like the lotus, red and broad; His body like blue mount Shines,  
His Conch is like the Moon bright and His discus, a veritable Sun.

**Note**

Tirumāḻai Āṇṭāṉ told Rāmānuja that this song reveals how the Āḻvār was attracted to the Lord through the display of His exquisite personal charms and ascribed this interpretation to his Master, Śrī Āḷavantār (Yāmuṉa) Śrī Rāmānuja was unusually quiet and when asked by the Instructor whether he had nothing to say against, as he very often did, Śrī Rāmānuja signified his approval through his broad, bewitching smile. But Śrī Parāśara Bhaṭṭar would put it differently and say, “The song reveals the extra brilliance displayed by the Lord’s person after making the Āḻvār and his associates His own”. Whereas the former interpretation makes the Lord’s personal charms the cause or instrument for wearing away the Āḻvār and bringing him into the Lord’s fold, the latter shows it as the effect, the result of bringing the Āḻvār and his association unto the Lord's fold.




## 2.7.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மதுசூதனை அன்றி மற்று இலேன் என்று எத்தாலும் கருமம் இன்றி,  
துதி சூழ்ந்த பாடல்கள் பாடி ஆட நின்று ஊழி ஊழிதொறும்,  
எதிர் சூழல் புக்கு எனைத்தோர் பிறப்பும் எனக்கே அருள்கள் செய்ய,  
விதி சூழ்ந்ததால் எனக்கேல் அம்மான் திரிவிக்கிரமனையே.

matucūtaṉai aṉṟi maṟṟu ilēṉ eṉṟu ettālum karumam iṉṟi,  
tuti cūḻnta pāṭalkaḷ pāṭi āṭa niṉṟu ūḻi ūḻitoṟum,  
etir cūḻal pukku eṉaittōr piṟappum eṉakkē aruḷkaḷ ceyya,  
viti cūḻntatāl eṉakkēl ammāṉ tirivikkiramaṉaiyē.

**English translation of verse 2.7.6:**

In none but Matucūtan do I take refuge,  
On and on I sing, as an end in itself, hymns of His glory;  
This is because of Tirivikkiramaṉ’s grace extraordinary,  
Who took births alongside, to set me right, down the ages.

**Note**

The Āḻvār has passed through a staggering cycle of births. The Lord also incarnated every time, in order to get hold of the Āḻvār, but only now He could get hold of him and bring him up to the required standard. A pertinent question is asked at this stage as to why the Omnipotent Lord should not have grabbed at the Āḻvār straightaway if He was so keen on getting at him, instead of following such a tedious and time-absorbing process. No doubt, the Lord could have adopted the short-cut, suggested above, in His unbridled independence, for there is none to question Him. But an unreserved and unqualified amnesty would result in wholesale emancipation, *en masse*, which would cut across the very foundation of the Śāstras. The Lord is, therefore, on the look-out for some pretext or the other to reclaim the Subject through His extra-liberal standards. With this object, He also incarnated every time the Āḻvār was born but failed in His mission all along. Now, at long last, He has succeeded.

We can take it that this song reveals either the Lord’s extreme grace or the Āḻvār’s extreme humility.




## 2.7.7
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

திரிவிக்கிரமன் செந்தாமரைக் கண் எம்மான் என் செங்கனி வாய்  
உருவில் பொலிந்த வெள்ளைப் பளிங்கு நிறத்தனன் என்று என்று, உள்ளி  
பரவிப் பணிந்து பல் ஊழி ஊழி நின் பாத பங்கயமே,  
மருவித் தொழும் மனமே தந்தாய் வல்லைகாண் என் வாமனனே

tirivikkiramaṉ centāmaraik kaṇ emmāṉ eṉ ceṅkaṉi vāy  
uruvil polinta veḷḷaip paḷiṅku niṟattaṉaṉ eṉṟu eṉṟu, uḷḷi  
paravip paṇintu pal ūḻi ūḻi niṉ pāta paṅkayamē,  
maruvit toḻum maṉamē tantāy vallaikāṇ eṉ vāmaṉaṉē

**English translation of verse 2.7.7:**

Vāmaṉaṉ, my Lord, in just three strides you measured  
The whole universe, as Tirivikkiramaṉ and in me ushered  
A mind rivetted to your lotus feet, days on end adoring you,  
My red lotus-eyed Master with sparkling teeth, how capable of you!

**Notes**

\(1\) *Āḻvār to the Lord*: How capable of you, how gracious! you have endowed me with a mind which adores You and sings your glory all the time as an end in itself.

\(2\) Śrī Nampiḻḻai has it that it was not a case of reconditioning the Āḻvār’s mind so as to make it God-bent but one of fitting him with a new mind altogehter, one picked out from the Lord’s strong room where valuables are stored up.




## 2.7.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வாமனன் என் மரகத வண்ணன் தாமரைக் கண்ணினன்-  
காமனைப் பயந்தாய், என்று என்று உன் கழல் பாடியே பணிந்து,  
தூ மனத்தனனாய்ப் பிறவித் துழதி நீங்க, என்னைத்  
தீ மனம் கெடுத்தாய் உனக்கு என் செய்கேன்? என் சிரீதரனே.

vāmaṉaṉ eṉ marakata vaṇṇaṉ tāmaraik kaṇṇiṉaṉ-  
kāmaṉaip payantāy, eṉṟu eṉṟu uṉ kaḻal pāṭiyē paṇintu,  
tū maṉattaṉaṉāyp piṟavit tuḻati nīṅka, eṉṉait  
tī maṉam keṭuttāy uṉakku eṉ ceykēṉ? eṉ cirītaraṉē.

**English translation of verse 2.7.8:**

Oh, Citītaraṉ, My Lord, You redeemed my foul mind  
And rid me of life’s miseries, and now with a mind pure,  
I worship Your feet, Sing and adore you as the Sire  
Of Kāmaṉ, Vāmaṉaṉ, my lotus-eyed Lord, the emerald mount  
And so on; (this great good of Yours) how can I recompense?

**Notes**

\(i\) The Lord is referred to as the Father of Kāmaṉ (Manmatha), because He begot through Rukmiṇī Devī, a Son by name Pradhyumna of exquisite beauty, said to be an ‘Aṃśa’ or incarnation of Manmatha, the minor-deity inducing amorous love.

\(ii\) What was the Āḻvār’s mind like before it was redeemed? Śrī Nampiḷḷai says that it was hardly fit for reconditioning, as such, erratic like the one going in for ambrosia as well as poison, feeling attracted towards God as well as the petty pleasures of the sensual world. The Lord’s grace has now operated in two ways, namely, bestowal of a mind solely rivetted to the Lord’s lotus feet after throwing away the *erstwhile mind*, damned beyond redemption.




## 2.7.9
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

சிரீதரன் செய்ய தாமரைக் கண்ணன் என்று என்று இராப்பகல் வாய்  
வெரீஇ, அலமந்து கண்கள் நீர் மல்கி வெவ்வுயிர்த்து உயிர்த்து,  
மரீஇய தீவினை மாள இன்பம் வளர வைகல் வைகல்  
இரீஇ உன்னை என்னுள் வைத்தனை என் இருடீகேசனே.

cirītaraṉ ceyya tāmaraik kaṇṇaṉ eṉṟu eṉṟu irāppakal vāy  
verīi, alamantu kaṇkaḷ nīr malki vevvuyirttu uyirttu,  
marīiya tīviṉai māḷa iṉpam vaḷara vaikal vaikal  
irīi uṉṉai eṉṉuḷ vaittaṉai eṉ iruṭīkēcaṉē.

**English translation of verse 2.7.9:**

My (Lord) Iruṭīkēcaṉ, how gracious of You indeed!  
Lodged in me, every moment my joy you expand.  
Having rid me of all my erstwhile sins dense;  
Day and night, with hot tears in my rolling eyes,  
I kept crying, Oh. Cirītaraṉ, Oh, lotus-eyed,

**Note**

*Āḻvār to the Lord*:

> “I was crying out for you all the time, with tears welling up my eyes,
> breathing hot, but all my erstwhile miseries you have now irrevocably
> cut out so that I go on enjoying you, and my joy grows by leaps and
> bounds every moment”.

Well, this is the interpretation, current from the days of Śrī Parāśara Bhaṭṭar who gave out this meaning. The earlier preceptors held that the Lord cut out the dense sins of the Āḻvār and made him cry out in ecstasy the Lord’s names with tearful eyes, day and night, breathing hot, besides promoting this God-love of his every moment.




## 2.7.10
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

இருடீகேசன் எம் பிரான் இலங்கை அரக்கர் குலம்,  
முருடு தீர்த்த பிரான் எம்மான் அமரர் பெம்மான் என்று என்று,  
தெருடியாகில் நெஞ்சே வணங்கு திண்ணம் அறி அறிந்து,  
மருடியேலும் விடேல் கண்டாய் நம்பி பற்பநாபனையே.

iruṭīkēcaṉ em pirāṉ ilaṅkai arakkar kulam,

teruṭiyākil neñcē vaṇaṅku tiṇṇam aṟi aṟintu,  
maruṭiyēlum viṭēl kaṇṭāy nampi paṟpanāpaṉaiyē.

**English translation of verse 2.7.10:**

My mind, if in you there’s any clarity left,  
Worship my Lord, Iruṭikēcaṉ, Chief of celestials aloft;  
Know for certain and act, He is our Benefactor great,  
Who rid Laṅkā of its tough Rākśasa [Rākṣasa] clan,  
Shrink not from Him still, unto Paṟpanāpaṉ, the perfect, hold on.

**Notes**

\(i\) By addressing his mind in this manner the Āḻvār was only disclosing to the Lord his firm hold on Him.

\(ii\) Slaying the ten-headed Rāvaṇa is on a par with the redemption of the Āḻvār’s mind which, aided by the five motororgans and five sense-organs, was holding fiendish sway over him, launched into the Sea of Saṃsāra. Śrī Nampiḻḷai likens the bestowal, on the Āḻvār, of a Godbent mind free from the devilish clutches of the senses in lieu of his erstwhile foul mind, to the destruction of Rāvaṇa and installation of Vibhīṣaṇa on the throne of Laṅkā.

\(iii\) The Āḻvār says unto his mind:

> “How can you, my mind, get out of the ken of Padmanābha, the perfect
> Lord with all auspicious attributes, and come to grief? The Lord is
> perfect in every respect, Yon know. His attributes, His form exquisite
> and His benefaction unto us”.




## 2.7.11
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

பற்பநாபன் உயர்வு அற உயரும் பெரும் திறலோன்,  
எற்பரன் என்னை ஆக்கிக் கொண்டு எனக்கே தன்னைத் தந்த  
கற்பகம், என் அமுதம் கார் முகில் போலும் வேங்கட நல்  
வெற்பன், விசும்போர் பிரான் எந்தை தாமோதரனே.

veṟpaṉ, vicumpōr pirāṉ entai tāmōtaraṉē.

**English translation of verse 2.7.11:**

On Paṟpanāpaṉ’s navel sprouted the lotus  
Whence ail worlds came, of matchless prowess,  
And in me wholly absorbed. He is the ‘*Kaṛpaka*’ tree.  
That yielded me and then gave itself unto me;  
Chief of Celestials, Vēṅkaṭam is His favourite abode, He’s my nectar,  
The cloud-hued Lord, Tāmōtaraṉ is my loving Master,

**Notes**

\(i\) The Āḻvār says that the Supreme Lord, with none above Him, is also the humblest; having made the Āḻvār His vassal, the Lord is wholly absorbed in him, making it appear that He knows no one else.

\(ii\) The ‘*Kaṛpaka*’ tree is the legendary wish-yielding tree. Even as there is a vast gulf between the Lord’s attributes and the comparable material in each case, the Lord, taken as the ‘*Kaṛpaka*’ tree, differs from it in the following essential respects:

> (*a*) the supplicant is also the Lord’s creation;  
> (*b*) the Supplicant gets absorbed in the Lord;  
> (*c*) the supplicant gets not only all that he wants but gets the Lord
> Himself, who is thus the extraordinary tree, giving itself to the
> Seeker; and  
> (*d*) the Lord Himself becomes the object of enjoyment by His
> devotees.




## 2.7.12
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

தாமோதரனை தனி முதல்வனை ஞாலம் உண்டவனை,  
ஆமோ தரம் அறிய ஒருவர்க்கு? என்றே தொழும் அவர்கள்,  
தாமோதரன் உரு ஆகிய சிவற்கும் திசைமுகற்கும்,  
ஆமோ தரம் அறிய எம்மானை என் ஆழி வண்ணனையே.

tāmōtaraṉ uru ākiya civaṟkum ticaimukaṟkum,  
āmō taram aṟiya emmāṉai eṉ āḻi vaṇṇaṉaiyē.

**English translation of verse 2.7.12:**

Tāmōtaraṉ, my peerless, primordial Lord,  
Of oceanic hue, who devoured all the worlds,  
Even exalted Ticaimukaṉ (Brahmā) and Civaṉ cannot scan and comprehend,  
Though on His person they stay and worship Him  
And venture to think that they can His glory fathom.

**Note**

The Lord cannot be comprehended through one’s own effort by any one, including the exalted Brahmā and Śiva, although they stay right on His body and are inclined to be presumptuous, venturing to attempt the impossible. But He is fully comprehended by the Āḻvār and devotees like him to whom the Lord has, on His own, vouchsafed all that knowledge, clear and concise, full and complete. The Lord who is the causeless cause, the Progenitor of the entire Universe, combines in Him the triple aspects unknown to many, namely, (1) He is the vassal of His devotees, (2) He is the originator of the Universe and (3) the friend-in-need, succouring one and all, in times of distress. Even the Āḻvār cannot fully comprehend the many favours done to him by the Lord, although one so great, had disclosed to the Āḻvār, so low, the vast array of His oceanic traits, like compressing an ocean inside the tiny mustard,




## 2.7.13
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வண்ண மா மணிச் சோதியை அமரர் தலைமகனை,  
கண்ணனை நெடுமாலைத் தென் குருகூர்ச் சடகோபன்,  
பண்ணிய தமிழ் மாலை ஆயிரத்துள் இவை பன்னிரண்டும்,  
பண்ணில் பன்னிரு நாமப் பாட்டு அண்ணல் தாள் அணைவிக்குமே.

paṇṇiya tamiḻ mālai āyirattuḷ ivai paṉṉiraṇṭum,  
paṇṇil paṉṉiru nāmap pāṭṭu aṇṇal tāḷ aṇaivikkumē.

**English translation of verse 2.7.13:**

These tuneful songs on the Lord’s twelve names, numbering a dozen,  
Out of the thousand Tamil hymns yielded by Teṉkurukūr Caṭakōpaṉ,  
Setting out the love, intense and unlimited, of Kaṇṇaṉ,  
Lustrous like the blue gem grand, Chief of *Amarars* (celestials)  
(Unto His devotees), will unto the Sire’s feet bind (the chanters).

**Note**

In this end-stanza, the Lord’s love, intense and unlimited, for His devotees is emphasised. This provides the impetus for the Lord looking upon His devotees as His sole objects of enjoyment. Contact with this decad (Tiruvāymoḻi) is enough to render one, such a beloved devotee of Lord Kēcavaṉ.
