## 00 Intro6.7
The mother continues her narration, in this decad also. She lay beside her love-lorn daughter, soothing her, as best as could be done. But suddenly, the mother groped the bed next to hers and discovered that her daughter was not in it. The former searched for the latter, high and low, but in vain. The mother was, however, well aware of her daughter’s exuberance of love for the Lord, enshrined at Tirukkōḷūr and, therefore, rightly concluded that the Nāyakī should have gone there. The Nāyakī’s extraordinary devotion to that pilgrim centre is now voiced forth by the mother. Actually, the Āḻvār’s longing for incessant communion with the Lord at Tirukkōḷūr finds expression, in this decad, the mother functioning as but the mouthpiece.




## 6.7.1
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

உண்ணும் சோறு பருகும்நீர் தின்னும் வெற்றிலையும் எல்லாம்  
கண்ணன், எம்பெருமான் என்று என்றே கண்கள் நீர்மல்கி,  
மண்ணினுள் அவன்சீர் வளம் மிக்கவன் ஊர் வினவி,  
திண்ணம் என் இளமான் புகும் ஊர் திருக்கோளூரே.

uṇṇum cōṟu parukumnīr tiṉṉum veṟṟilaiyum ellām  
kaṇṇaṉ, emperumāṉ eṉṟu eṉṟē kaṇkaḷ nīrmalki,  
maṇṇiṉuḷ avaṉcīr vaḷam mikkavaṉ ūr viṉavi,  
tiṇṇam eṉ iḷamāṉ pukum ūr tirukkōḷūrē.

**English translation of verse 6.7.1:**

‘Tis certain that my daughter like unto the doe young,  
Who, with tears welling up her eyes, always keeps saying,  
Kaṇṇaṉ is unto her the food of the hungry, beverage of the thirsty  
And the betel chewed for pleasure, has, after due enquiry.  
Gone to Tirukkōḷūr where resides the Lord, grand and majestic.

### Notes

\(i\) The famous author of ‘Ācārya Hṛdayam’ has succinctly brought out the superior excellence of the Āḻvār vis-a-vis the Ṛṣis. Whereas the Ṛṣis subsisted on the forest produce, such as roots, fruits etc, Lord Kṛṣṇa was the sole Sustainer for Nammāḻvār, the very food needed for appeasing hunger, the water required for quenching thirst and the betels one chews for pleasure, the one and only source catering to his God-hunger, God-thirst and Godlove. The Āḻvār was ‘Kṛṣṇa tṛṣṇā tatva’, the very personification of God-love. Unto him, Vāsudeva was all, “Vāsudevas sarvamiti”, The gnostic mother was, therefore, quite sure that her daughter of such a disposition would have found her way, after due enquiry, to Tirukkōḻūr, the place where the Lord exhibits the exuberance of His wealth and auspicious qualities, in super-abundance.

\(ii\) An interesting question was posed by Āḷavantār (Saint Yāmunācārya) to his audience, as to which of the two, Saint Nammāḻvār who looked upon God as his food etc., or Saint Tirumaṅkai Āḻvār who exclaimed that the Lord had stolen away his soul, they had to be more apprehensive about. They observed. “We have indeed to fear more, the former’s precipitate flight, alone and unaided, to the shrine at Tirukkōḷūr, than for the latter who is already in the company of the Lord at Tiruvāli. no matter how the union came about, stealth or otherwise. Our sympathies are naturally with Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī, on her lone journey, in quest of the Lord of her heart”, The great master, however, thought otherwise: according to him, there was the fear of Tirumaṅkai Āḻvār and the Lord getting into a state of delirium on account of their rapturous reciprocation of ravishing love, a state of inebriation or stupor, such as the addicts of dōtura-narcotic fall into. The plight of Saint Tirumaṅkai Āḻvār, drowned in love, therefore, excited their fear more than that of Saint Nammāḻvār who was yet lonely and self-conscious, full of ardent expectation of meeting his beloved Lord.

\(iii\) The eyes of the Saints, soaked in God-love, swim with pearls of tears of delight. As Mahābhārata puts it, even God-Science, such as Upanishads, is remote from the ambrosia of Lord Hari’s narratives, if it fails to melt the heart, wet the eye and thrill the frame. Nañcīyar used to say: “Thrice did I go over the treatise of Tiruvāymoḻi with Tirunaraiyūr Araiyar but none of the teachings did affect and melt my heart so much as when I actually witnessed him once, when explaining a passage, transported into the region of ecstasy, with tears rolling down the cheek”,

\(iv\) A native of Tirukkōḷūr left the holy land and employed himself elsewhere, tilling the land. Anaṉtāḻvān, a great devotee, who happened to see him, enquired where he came from. On learning that the man hailed from Tirukkōḻūr, Anantāḻvāṉ grew furious and exclaimed that one could as well graze a couple of asses, staying in that holy land and eke out one's livelihood, rather than forsake the land of eternal living where the Eternal Master stays, in all His splendour. Similarly, when Saint Rāmānuja was proceeding to Tirukkōḷūr, he saw a woman coming from the opposite direction and elicited from her that she was actually coming from holy Tirukkōḷūr. The Saint exclaimed, in great surprise “What, is it at all possible for those who have once taken their abode in that holy place to leave it?”

\(v\) Tirukkōḷūr is one of the eighteen pilgrim centres of Pāṇḍiya nādu. It is also the birthplace of Maturakavi Āḻvār.




## 6.7.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஊரும் நாடும் உலகமும் தன்னைப்போல் அவனுடைய  
பேரும் தார்களுமே பிதற்ற கற்பு வான் இடறி,  
சேரும் நல் வளம்சேர் பழனத் திருக்கோளூர்க்கே,  
போரும் கொல் உரையீர் கொடியேன் கொடி பூவைகளே!

ūrum nāṭum ulakamum taṉṉaippōl avaṉuṭaiya  
pērum tārkaḷumē pitaṟṟa kaṟpu vāṉ iṭaṟi,  
cērum nal vaḷamcēr paḻaṉat tirukkōḷūrkkē,  
pōrum kol uraiyīr koṭiyēṉ koṭi pūvaikaḷē!

**English translation of verse 6.7.2:**

Ye, Pūvai birds, this sinner’s daughter, who makes  
The whole world, hall and hamlet, prattle like herself the Lord’s names  
And His insignia, breaking the bounds of modesty, has it seems  
Reached Tirukkōḷūr, rich and fertile; will you unto me utter  
If she would at least for your sake come back here?

### Notes

\(i\) The mother enquiries of the little pūvai birds, the playmates of Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī, whether she would come back, at least for their sake. She is so dazed that she is not conscious of the fact that she can’t expect a reply from the speechless birds.

\(ii\) The mother is at a loss to understand why her daughter should at all go elsewhere, in search of the Godly, having herself induced God-consciousness in one and all, in her native place itself, where every one keeps uttering the Lord’s holy names and attributes like her. It is noteworthy that, to saints, the utterance of the holy name of God is so preciously sweet that they imagine, the whole world sings forth like themselves. The world is indeed acceptable to them when they invest it with their own divine sentiments and see God everywhere; otherwise, it becomes detestable, just like the Kingdom of Ayodhya itself, detested by Bharata, when Rāma was not there. Śrī Nampiḷḷai puts it that the mother questions the necessity for the Nāyakī going all the way to Tirukkōḷūr, while she could as well enjoy all that felicity in her native surroundings, the mutual enlightenment and entertainment in the domain of God-love, in the company of kindred souls.




## 6.7.3
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

பூவை பைங்கிளிகள் பந்து தூதை பூம் புட்டில்கள்,  
யாவையும் திருமால் திருநாமங்களே கூவி எழும், என்  
பாவை போய் இனித் தண் பழனத் திருக்கோளூர்க்கே,  
கோவை வாய் துடிப்ப மழைக்கண்ணொடு என் செய்யும்கொலோ?

pūvai paiṅkiḷikaḷ pantu tūtai pūm puṭṭilkaḷ,  
yāvaiyum tirumāl tirunāmaṅkaḷē kūvi eḻum, eṉ  
pāvai pōy iṉit taṇ paḻaṉat tirukkōḷūrkkē,  
kōvai vāy tuṭippa maḻaikkaṇṇoṭu eṉ ceyyumkolō?

**English translation of verse 6.7.3:**

All that joy one derives from the articles of sport,  
The ball, flower basket, cooking pots, little birds and parrots,  
In singing the Lord's holy names my daughter would have,  
And yet, 1 know not how she would actually fare  
In Tirukkōḷūr. cool and fertile, with trembling lips red and tearful eyes.

**Note**

The mother says: “Even in her childhood days, when one could expect her to play with toys, my daughter revelled in singing the Lord’s holy names. It is not as if she was devoid of the means of sustenance and had to go elsewhere, in search of it. I don’t know why she has at all gone to Tiruk kōḷūr”,




## 6.7.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கொல்லை என்பர்கொலோ குணம் மிக்கனள் என்பர்கொலோ,  
சில்லை வாய்ப் பெண்டுகள் அயல் சேரி உள்ளாரும் எல்லே,  
செல்வம் மல்கி அவன்கிடந்த திருக்கோளூர்க்கே,  
மேல் இடை நுடங்க இளமான் செல்ல மேவினளே.

kollai eṉparkolō kuṇam mikkaṉaḷ eṉparkolō,  
cillai vāyp peṇṭukaḷ ayal cēri uḷḷārum ellē,  
celvam malki avaṉkiṭanta tirukkōḷūrkkē,  
mēl iṭai nuṭaṅka iḷamāṉ cella mēviṉaḷē.

**English translation of verse 6.7.4:**

My daughter, like unto the doe young, has her mind made up  
To go to plentiful Tirukkōḷūr where reclines the Lord,  
Straining her waist thin; I know not whether the local gossips  
And neighbouring women will praise her as Godly  
Or condemn her as immodest and unruly.

### Note

There are two ways of looking at the Nāyakī’s behaviour. Those who have unflinching faith in salvation through the Lord’s redemptive grace and await the descent of such grace on them, in due course, would certainly not countenance the Nāyakī running about, courting the Lord, while those, who are all agog for the quick consummation, the acceleration of the union with the Lord, cutting short the interval, would surely applaud the Nāyakī’s flaming love and ardour. Thus there is scope for condemnation as well as felicitation of the Nāyakī, by the women of the village and those in the neighbouring village, giving rise to the mother’s speculation, as above.




## 6.7.5
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மேவி நைந்து நைந்து விளையாடலுறாள் என் சிறுத்-  
தேவிபோய், இனித்தன் திருமால் திருக்கோளூரில்,  
பூ இயல் பொழிலும் தடமும் அவன் கோயிலும் கண்டு,  
ஆவி உள் குளிர எங்ஙனே உகக்கும்கொல் இன்றே?

mēvi naintu naintu viḷaiyāṭaluṟāḷ eṉ ciṟut-  
tēvipōy, iṉittaṉ tirumāl tirukkōḷūril,  
pū iyal poḻilum taṭamum avaṉ kōyilum kaṇṭu,  
āvi uḷ kuḷira eṅṅaṉē ukakkumkol iṉṟē?

**English translation of verse 6.7.5:**

My little angelic daughter, in God-head engrossed, has thinned down  
And from recreation refrains, she has from here gone  
To her Lord unique in Tirukkōḷūr and to her heart’s fill,  
Enjoy she shall, the orchids fine, the tanks and the temple;  
What a pity, watch I can’t how indeed she regales!

### Note

Even during childhood, the Nāyakī’s sole pastime was to sing the holy names of the Lord while her playmates would want to indulge in routine recreation. And now, she has gone to the famous pilgrim centre, Tirukkōḷūr, abounding in lovely scenery, warming up her heart. The manner of her enjoyment will indeed be unique but the mother feels that she is not by the side of her daughter to watch her jubilation.




## 6.7.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

இன்று எனக்கு உதவாது அகன்ற இளமான் இனிப்போய்,  
தென் திசைத் திலதம் அனைய திருக்கோளூர்க்கே  
சென்று, தன் திருமால் திருக்கண்ணும் செவ்வாயும் கண்டு,  
நின்று நின்று நையும் நெடும் கண்கள் பனி மல்கவே.

iṉṟu eṉakku utavātu akaṉṟa iḷamāṉ iṉippōy,  
teṉ ticait tilatam aṉaiya tirukkōḷūrkkē  
ceṉṟu, taṉ tirumāl tirukkaṇṇum cevvāyum kaṇṭu,  
niṉṟu niṉṟu naiyum neṭum kaṇkaḷ paṉi malkavē.

**English translation of verse 6.7.6:**

My doe-like daughter is unto me of no avail,  
She has left me and gone to Tirukkōḷūr, the jewel  
Of the South and there she would just dwindle,  
Gazing at the Lord’s lovely eyes and lips red,  
With tears of joy swelling up her eyes broad.

### Note

This song is but a follow-up of the preceding song, describing the manner of the Nāyakī’s rejoicing, at the other end.




## 6.7.7
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மல்கு நீர்க் கண்ணொடு மையல் உற்ற மனத்தினளாய்,  
அல்லும் நன் பகலும் நெடுமால் என்று அழைத்து இனிப்போய்,  
செல்வம் மல்கி அவன் கிடந்த திருக்கோளுர்க்கே,  
ஒல்கி ஒல்கி நடந்து எங்ஙனே புகும்கொல் ஒசிந்தே?

malku nīrk kaṇṇoṭu maiyal uṟṟa maṉattiṉaḷāy,  
allum naṉ pakalum neṭumāl eṉṟu aḻaittu iṉippōy,  
celvam malki avaṉ kiṭanta tirukkōḷurkkē,  
olki olki naṭantu eṅṅaṉē pukumkol ocintē?

**English translation of verse 6.7.7:**

I wonder how my daughter, weak and tired,  
With tears brimming the eyes and by deep love fired  
For the Lord of her heart, beckoning Him, day and night,  
Could trudge her way to Tirukōḷūr, all right.

### Note

The mother has now begun to suspect whether her daughter, weighed down by God-love, could have at all trudged along, to Tirukkōḷūr without getting bogged down on the way.




## 6.7.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஒசிந்த நுண் இடைமேல் கையை வைத்து நொந்து நொந்து,  
கசிந்த நெஞ்சினளாய் கண்ண நீர் துளும்பச் செல்லும்கொல்,  
ஒசிந்த ஒண் மலராள் கொழுநன் திருக்கோளூர்க்கே,  
கசிந்த நெஞ்சினளாய் எம்மை நீத்த எம் காரிகையே?

ocinta nuṇ iṭaimēl kaiyai vaittu nontu nontu,  
kacinta neñciṉaḷāy kaṇṇa nīr tuḷumpac cellumkol,  
ocinta oṇ malarāḷ koḻunaṉ tirukkōḷūrkkē,  
kacinta neñciṉaḷāy emmai nītta em kārikaiyē?

**English translation of verse 6.7.8:**

With a mind, soaked in love, unto Tirukkōḷūr drawn,  
Where resides the Spouse of Lakṣmī, the lotus-born,  
My pretty daughter has forsaken me and gone;  
Holding her waist, thin and emaciated, in great pain,  
With tearful eyes, could she have to her destination gone?

### Note

The mother thinks that the Nāyakī should have forsaken the former and gone to the Lord at Tirukkōḷūr, to worship the holy conjunction of the Lord and the Divine Mother (Lakṣmī), banking on Her support, sure and sweet. At the same time, the mother also apprehends whether the frail daughter could at all stand the strain of the journey to that place and make it all right.




## 6.7.9
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

காரியம் நல்லனகள் அவை காணில் என் கண்ணனுக்கு என்று,  
ஈரியாய் இருப்பாள் இது எல்லாம் கிடக்க இனிப் போய்,  
சேரி பல் பழி தூஉய் இரைப்ப திருக்கோளூர்க்கே,  
நேரிழை நடந்தாள் எம்மை ஒன்றும் நினைந்திலளே.

kāriyam nallaṉakaḷ avai kāṇil eṉ kaṇṇaṉukku eṉṟu,  
īriyāy iruppāḷ itu ellām kiṭakka iṉip pōy,  
cēri pal paḻi tūuy iraippa tirukkōḷūrkkē,  
nēriḻai naṭantāḷ emmai oṉṟum niṉaintilaḷē.

**English translation of verse 6.7.9:**

My bejewelled daughter with her love-laden heart  
Would all things good, unto her Kaṇṇaṉ set apart;  
Leaving all the wealth over here she has set out  
Towards Tirukkōḷūr; the folks here will come out  
With all sorts of scandals against her but she minds not  
All that and unto her we really matter not.

### Note

Whereas the worldlings would want all good things for themselves and their sons and daughters, Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī would, in the exuberance of her love for Lord Kṛṣṇa, insist that all good things be earmarked for His use. With such great wealth of God-love in her, where was the need for her to go anywhere else? This is what agitates the mind of the mother; rather, she feels impoverished without the Nāyakī and pines for the latter’s attention. As a matter of fact, one’s own children become worthy of reverence and worship, when they become God’s own. Saint Tirumaṅkai Āḻvār said in Periya Tirumoḻi, VII-2-9, “How can I look upon the (Spiritual) son, who goes to worship the Lord at Tirukaṇṇapuram, as my (bodily) son?”. Indeed, worthiness makes no distinction between father and son, preceptor and disciple. It is said that one Ammuṇiyāḻvār used to prostrate unto his own disciple, being fully conscious of the latter’s spiritual greatness, demanding such reverence. One day, the great Nañcīyar led his disciple, Nampiḷḷai, to the holy assembly, where the former loudly acclaimed the greatness of the latter.




## 6.7.10
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நினைக்கிலேன் தெய்வங்காள் நெடும் கண் இளமான் இனிப்போய்  
அனைத்து உலகும் உடைய அரவிந்தலோசனனைத்,  
தினைத்தனையும் விடாள் அவன் சேர் திருக்கோளூர்க்கே,  
மனைக்கு வான் பழியும் நினையாள் செல்ல வைத்தனளே.

niṉaikkilēṉ teyvaṅkāḷ neṭum kaṇ iḷamāṉ iṉippōy  
aṉaittu ulakum uṭaiya aravintalōcaṉaṉait,  
tiṉaittaṉaiyum viṭāḷ avaṉ cēr tirukkōḷūrkkē,  
maṉaikku vāṉ paḻiyum niṉaiyāḷ cella vaittaṉaḷē.

**English translation of verse 6.7.10:**

Oh, gods, my broad-eyed daughter, like the doe young, has gone  
To the lotus-eyed Lord Supreme, in Tirukkōḷūr, all of a sudden.  
With no thought of infamy on her family heaped and gazes  
At Him there, all the time, I am indeed in a maze.

### Note

Unable to brook separation from her daughter, the mother feels that the Nāyakī has been away from her, for quite a long time. It was indeed high time, she had come back but then the mother visualises the possibility of the Nāyakī getting absorbed in the exquisite charm of the lotus-eyed Lord (Aravintalōcaṉa) standing in front of the Deity, all the time, with no intermission. In such a frame of mind, there was no question of her being worried about what others might say about her abnormal behaviour and how it would affect the reputation of the family, as a whole. The mother addressed the Celestials in the upper regions, as if to enlist their sympathy.




## 6.7.11
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வைத்த மா நிதியாம் மதுசூதனையே அலற்றி,  
கொத்து அலர் பொழில்சூழ் குருகூர்ச் சடகோபன் சொன்ன,  
பத்து நூற்றுள் இப்பத்து அவன்சேர் திருக்கோளூர்க்கே,  
சித்தம் வைத்து உரைப்பார் திகழ் பொன் உலகு ஆள்வாரே.

vaitta mā nitiyām matucūtaṉaiyē alaṟṟi,  
kottu alar poḻilcūḻ kurukūrc caṭakōpaṉ coṉṉa,  
pattu nūṟṟuḷ ippattu avaṉcēr tirukkōḷūrkkē,  
cittam vaittu uraippār tikaḻ poṉ ulaku āḷvārē.

**English translation of verse 6.7.11:**

Those that chant these songs ten, with devotion to Tirukkōḷūr,  
Out of the thousand composed by Caṭakōpaṉ of Kurukūr,  
With flower gardens in fine array all round, in adoration of Matucūtaṉ,  
The accumulated Treasure supreme, will over the Eternal Land, reign.

### Note

The Lord, as the Treasure supreme, can be freely drawn upon, by one and all, without any fear of extinction, being an inexhaustible fountain of bliss. The chanters of this decad will have none of the difficulties the Āḻvār faced, such as the confrontation between Mother and daughter; on the other hand, they can hold perfect sway over Heaven.
