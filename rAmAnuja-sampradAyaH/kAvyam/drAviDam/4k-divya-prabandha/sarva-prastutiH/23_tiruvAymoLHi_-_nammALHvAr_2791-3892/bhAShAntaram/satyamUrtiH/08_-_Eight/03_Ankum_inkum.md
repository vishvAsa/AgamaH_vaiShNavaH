## 8.3.1
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அங்கும் இங்கும் வானவர் தானவர் யாவரும்  
எங்கும் இனையைஎன்று உன்னைஅறியகிலாதுஅலற்றி  
அங்கம்சேரும் பூமகள் மண்மகள் ஆய்மகள்  
சங்குசக்கரக் கையவன் என்பர் சரணமே. (2)

aṅkum iṅkum vāṉavar tāṉavar yāvarum  
eṅkum iṉaiyaieṉṟu uṉṉaiaṟiyakilātualaṟṟi  
aṅkamcērum pūmakaḷ maṇmakaḷ āymakaḷ  
caṅkucakkarak kaiyavaṉ eṉpar caraṇamē. (2)

**English translation of verse 8.3.1:**

The Vāṉavar, Tāṉavar and all else, here, there and everywhere,  
Can hardly comprehend You but reckon You, in their own way.  
Merely as their Saviour, in times of need,  
The one, who the conch and discus wields  
And does on His person the triple Consorts Divine hold.

**Notes:**

The highest love to God is love rendered for God’s sake, love culminating in benediction or glorification of God. Love, so disinterestedly rendered, is love of purity and virginity and, under its influence, what is uppermost in the mind of the devotee is the Lord’s remarkable tenderness (Saukumārya) and bewitching beauty and he grows apprehensive of the Lord’s safety and seeks His well-being. This is what the Ālvār would expect of every votary of the Lord but, on a close scrutiny, he was shocked to find the votaries in all ranks, the Devas known to be friendly to God, the Asuras, inimical to the Devas and the humans falling under numerous categories, one and all of them, praying to the Lord only for making good all their deficiencies and bestowing on them the felicity they lack. None of them is found to bear any love to God for God’s sake, in the manner indicated at the outset. The glorious setting in which the Divine consorts are borne on the Lord’s winsome chest and the manner in which the white conch and the radiant discus are gracefully held in His hands should make the true God-lover enjoy them all and become, in turn, apprehensive of the Lord’s safety, ever alert to the possible danger to the Lord’s person, with a view to averting it. But these self-seekers look upon this very setting as conducive to their own well-being, to bestow choice gifts on them through the mediation of the Goddesses and protect them, with the discus and other weapons, whenever they are in trouble: The Āḻvār just abhors all such selfish persons seeking transient riches and expresses his abhorrence in this song, couched as an address to the Lord Himself.




## 00 Intro9.3
It was indeed a grand poetic imagery of the Āḻvār, conjuring up the vision of the Lord, as an emerald mountain, tall and lovely, moving along, bearing on its crest the radiant Sun and the silvery Moon all at once vide VIII-2-10. The Āḻvār could not lift his mind off this spectacular grandeur and, at the same time, this made him apprehensive of the safety of the Lord, so charming, who in this exquisite Form, moves about alone and unattended in this wicked world peopled by the ungodly and the selfish. The Āḻvār, felt vexed that there was none else to share his anxiety in this regard. While the Celestials in Heaven are soaked in ‘Brahmānubhava’, drinking deep of that perennial nectarean spring, namely, the Lord in that glorious transcendent setting, the worldlings are engrossed with sensual pleasures, Brahmā and other Devas would not hesitate to secure their selfish ends involving the Lord in battling against the ungodly Asurās and making Him the target of the arrows of the hostile hordes. When the Saint voiced forth his fear, as above, the Lord set him at ease, by pointing out that there was hardly any room for such fears, surrounded as He always is by the ‘Nityās’, ‘Muktās’ and the devout seekers of salvation. The Āḻvār then regains his composure, rid of his erstwhile fears. The initial disquietude is reflected in the third song of this decad and its clearance is revealed in the tenth song.




## 8.3.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

சரணமாகிய நான்மறை நூல்களும் சாராதே  
மரணம் தோற்றம் வான்பிணி மூப்புஎன்றுஇவை மாய்த்தோம்  
கரணப்பல்படை பற்றறஓடும் கனல்ஆழி  
அரணத்திண் படைஏந்திய ஈசற்கு ஆளாயே.

caraṇamākiya nāṉmaṟai nūlkaḷum cārātē  
maraṇam tōṟṟam vāṉpiṇi mūppueṉṟuivai māyttōm  
karaṇappalpaṭai paṟṟaṟaōṭum kaṉalāḻi  
araṇattiṇ paṭaiēntiya īcaṟku āḷāyē.

**English translation of verse 8.3.2:**

Alas! even those, who abjure the path the Vedas four prescribe  
For acquiring riches, have their final goal circumscribed  
By mere freedom from birth and death, pestilence and old age  
And do not get themselves in service engaged  
Of the Lord who the grand galaxy of protective weapons wields.

**Notes:**

In the preceding song, the Saint condemned those who hanker after the transient riches, instead of getting soley absorbed in God-love. And now, he speaks disparagingly of the ‘Kevalas’, those whose final goal is limited to mere emancipation from the terrific cycle of birth and death and remain-ling thereafter in disembodied state, lost for ever in that stupid self-enjoyment, thereby denying themselves the Supreme bliss of serving the Lord in Heaven in that glorious setting. It is a great pity, these persons are not alive to their essential nature (Svarūpa), as the exclusive vassals of the Lord, bound to serve Him exclusively. And so, the Āḻvār can hardly muster strength for the service of the Lord either from the ranks of the seekers of the so-called ‘riches’ or those of the ‘Kevalas’.




## 8.3.3
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஆளும் ஆளார் ஆழியும் சங்கும் சுமப்பார்தாம்  
வாளும் வில்லும் கொண்டு பின் செல்வார் மற்றுஇல்லை  
தாளும் தோளும் கைகளைஆரத் தொழக்காணேன்  
நாளும் நாளும் நாடுவன் அடியேன் ஞாலத்தே

āḷum āḷār āḻiyum caṅkum cumappārtām  
vāḷum villum koṇṭu piṉ celvār maṟṟuillai  
tāḷum tōḷum kaikaḷaiārat toḻakkāṇēṉ  
nāḷum nāḷum nāṭuvaṉ aṭiyēṉ ñālattē

**English translation of verse 8.3.3:**

Alas! there’s none to attend on my Lord,  
The conch and discus He Himself bears,  
I see none following Him. carrying His bow and sword;  
There’s none to admire His lovely feet and sinewy shoulders  
And worship Him to heart’s fill and so, I do fear  
His safety in this wicked world and Him I wish to follow.

**Notes:**

\(i\) In the last two songs, the Āḻvār deplored his own loneliness, there being none to join him in whole-hearted and self-less service of the Lord. And now, he feels for the Lord’s loneliness, there being no camp-follower to carry His weapons and attend on Him, with utter devotion, swayed by His exquisite charm.

\(ii\) The Āḻvār feels agitated, seeing that the Supreme Lord of the entire universe has not employed any one to attend on Him; deeply touched by His tenderness (saukumārya), the Āḻvār feels that the conch and discus might impose a great burden on Him and that He should, therefore, employ some one to carry them. Well, even if, as some would put it, the conch and the discus are the Lord’s insignia and have to be necessarily borne by Him, why should not some one be pressed into service for carrying His sword and bow? As a matter of fact, during His incarnation as Śrī Rāma, there was Lakṣmaṇa to carry the bow and arrows and serve Him in every conceivable manner. But now, in His Iconic Form, there is no such attendant and this depresses the Āḻvār, a great deal.

\(iii\) The Lord’s majestic gait and His imposing shoulders are indeed so charming that one can’t but pray that nothing untoward happened and marred the beauty, *par excellence*. And yet, the Āḻvār finds none in this wicked world, attracted to the Lord in this manner. That is why his fears are aggravated and this is particularly relevant in the context of the Lord’s iconic manifestation in this notorious world of miscreants like Rāvaṇa, Kaṃsa and Duryodhana, each with his own machinations for harming the Lord during His avatāras as Rāma and Kṛṣṇa.




## 8.3.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஞாலம் போனகம்பற்றி ஓர்முற்றா உருஆகி  
ஆலம்பேர்இலை அன்னவசம்செய்யும் அம்மானே  
காலம்பேர்வதுஓர் கார்இருள் ஊழி ஒத்துஉளதால் உன்

ñālam pōṉakampaṟṟi ōrmuṟṟā uruāki  
ālampērilai aṉṉavacamceyyum ammāṉē  
kālampērvatuōr kāriruḷ ūḻi ottuuḷatāl uṉ  
kōlamkāreḻil kāṇaluṟṟu āḻum koṭiyēṟkē

**English translation of verse 8.3.4:**

Oh, Sire, as a tender babe, You did on a fig-leaf repose,  
Bearing in Your stomach the entire Universe;  
Feast I would on Your Form exquisite like unto a rain-cloud,  
And when this Sinner is from it precluded,  
A split-second seems an age like unto the longish night.

**Notes:**

The Lord allays the fears of the Āḻvār by pointing out to him, His role as the Protector of the whole Universe and reminding him of how He sustained all the worlds with their numerous contents, right inside His stomach, during the deluge. Instead of allaying the Āḻvār’s fears, this episode only stirred up his thoughts in yet another direction, like unto a doting mother. On a vast expanse of water floats a tender fig-leaf on which reposes a tender babe and this babe holds in its stomach all the seven worlds with their massive contents. How incongruous and hence how frightful, the whole setting is! The Āḻvār can think of this babe only in terms of the turbulent One that slept in Yaśodhā’s cradle, after getting fed by her. Whether it was the result of immaturity, the work of a mere babe, the Āḻvār kept wondering. Could not the Lord have assumed a gigantic Form, sprawling far and wide on an equally spacious platform, so as not to frighten God-lovers of the calibre of the Āḻvār? His boundless love unto the Lord makes him lose all perspective of time-sequence and the Lord’s omnipotence itself, reducing Him to the abject position of a mere ward, under his loving protection. The Āḻvār’s anxiety is whether the Divine Babe lying on a tender leaf, alone and unaided, might slip into the deep waters; at least there was Yaśodhā keeping constant vigil when He slept in the cradle, but now there is none beside the Babe (īṭu).




## 8.3.5
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கொடியார்மாடக் கோளூர்அகத்தும் புளியங்குடியும்  
மடியாதுஇன்னே நீதுயில்மேவி மகிழ்ந்ததுதான்  
அடியார் அல்லல்தவிர்த்த அசைவோ? அன்றேல் இப்  
படிதான் நீண்டுதாவிய அசைவோ? பணியாயே.

koṭiyārmāṭak kōḷūrakattum puḷiyaṅkuṭiyum  
maṭiyātuiṉṉē nītuyilmēvi makiḻntatutāṉ  
aṭiyār allaltavirtta acaivō? aṉṟēl ip  
paṭitāṉ nīṇṭutāviya acaivō? paṇiyāyē.

**English translation of verse 8.3.5:**

How is it, my Lord, You lovingly repose and turn not this side or that,  
In kōḷūr and Puḷiṅkuṭi where banners play on castles smart?  
Is it due to the fatigue caused (during Your avatāras)  
When you did many a feat perform to alleviate  
Your devotees’ sufferings or the one that did result  
From the long strides you took to span the world immense?  
Which it is, may You unto me disclose.

**Notes:**

\(i\) Seeing the Āḻvār’s disquietitude over His lying alone on a tender leaf during the deluge, the Lord hastens to reveal unto him a different setting altogether, pertaining to His Iconic Form where He is attended upon by the votaries in their full complement. Mention of just two pilgrim centres, in this song, should be taken as covering the numerous other pilgrim centres where the Lord is reposing on His serpent-bed, such as Śrīraṅgam, Tirumeyyam, Kaṭanmallai, Tiruppēr, Aṉpil, Tiruvekhā etc.

\(ii\) The banners are displayed on house tops in the pilgrim centres, as a measure of decoration. But, in the eyes of the Āḻvār, this looms as a potential danger, helping the ungodly to easily locate this centre and invade it, intent upon harming the Lord enshrined there. Actually, the Āḻvār would want the Lord to remain out of reach of the devilish folks, even as Lord Kṛṣṇa grew up as a babe and then as a boy, in studious seclusion, fearing Kaṃsa’s machinations.

\(iii\) The Lord, in His perfect Iconic Form, is seen reposing in the aforementioned pilgrim centres, since long, all for the sake of redeeming His straying Subjects over here. It is indeed noteworthy, rather praiseworthy that He has not changed His posture even once, by turning right or left and yet, for all this immense hardship undergone by Him, none seems to appreciate it. If the Lord has not got up in sheer disgust and gone back to the Celestium, it is because of His fond hope that, some day, some devotees might turn up and appreciate His great gesture.;

\(iv\) The Lord appears to be relaxing after all the labours undertaken by Him on behalf of Indra, spanning, on the very day of His emergence as Vāmana, all the worlds, high and low, setting His tender feet on hill and dale. The Āḻvār enquires of the Lord whether He would not permit him to massage His shoulders or the feet, whichever needed relief from pain.




## 8.3.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

பணியாஅமரர் பணிவும் பண்பும் தாமேஆம்  
அணியார் ஆழியும் சங்கமும் ஏந்தும் அவர் காண்மின்  
தணியா வெம்நோய் உலகில் தவிர்ப்பான் திருநீல  
மணியார்மேனியோடு என்மனம் சூழவருவாரே.

paṇiyāamarar paṇivum paṇpum tāmēām  
aṇiyār āḻiyum caṅkamum ēntum avar kāṇmiṉ  
taṇiyā vemnōy ulakil tavirppāṉ tirunīla  
maṇiyārmēṉiyōṭu eṉmaṉam cūḻavaruvārē.

**English translation of verse 8.3.6:**

The Supreme Lord, served and adored by the Celestials in Heaven.  
Who know no Master other than He. has into this world come down,  
Wielding the conch and discus, like unto lovely jewels,  
Displaying His Form exquisite of saphire hue, the panacea for all ills;  
Bewildered is my mind whether any evil shall on Him befall.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The Lord’s exquisite charm is such as to excite the fear, (needless, of course, in that holy Land of the Celestials in Heaven) in regard to His safety. As elucidated, time and again, such an attitude stems from the inordinate love borne by them for the Lord whose rare charm and effulgence, just like all good things loved and longed for, excite, rightly or wrongly, fears regarding their durability. Such being the case, it is no wonder, the Āḻvār grew apprehensive of the safety of the Lord, who has come down, in all His splendour, to this dark land of dirt and devilry.

\(ii\) The Celestials, referred to, in the first line of this song, are the ‘Nitya Sūrīs’, the ever-free angles in heaven, as distinguished from the ‘Muktas’, the souls that reached heaven, after emancipation from the bondage of birth and rebirth, that dreadful cyclic operation. Unlike the latter, the former have the unique distinction of never having prostituted and defiled their head and tongue by bowing before the unworthy and singing their praise.




## 8.3.7
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வருவார் செல்வார் வண்பரிசாரத்து இருந்த என்  
திருவாழ்மார்வற்கு என்திறம் சொல்லார் செய்வதுஎன்  
உருவார் சக்கரம் சங்குசுமந்து இங்குஉம்மோடு  
ஒருபாடுஉழல்வான் ஓர்அடியானும் உளன்என்றே.

varuvār celvār vaṇparicārattu irunta eṉ  
tiruvāḻmārvaṟku eṉtiṟam collār ceyvatueṉ  
uruvār cakkaram caṅkucumantu iṅkuummōṭu  
orupāṭuuḻalvāṉ ōraṭiyāṉum uḷaṉeṉṟē.

**English translation of verse 8.3.7:**

Alas! those passing in and out of Vaṇparicāram, where resides my Lord  
Bearing Tiru (Lakṣmī) on His winsome chest, tell Him not.  
Here is a vassal ready to get close to Him and roam behind,  
Carrying His discus and conch lovely, keeping one end.

**Notes:**

The Āḻvār, seated inside of the hollow of the sacred tamarind tree in Tirunakari, pines for the service of the Lord in nearby Tiruvaṇparicāram. He fancies that the passersby are all moving to and from Tiruvaṇparicāram, only to tell the Lord over there about him and his ardour to serve Him, looking upon Him as his all (Vāsudevassarvamiti), and bring him back the message from that end. But, unfortunately, none goes near him and he concludes, with a galling sense of disappointment, that none of these persons has functioned in the manner he expected. By offering to keep up one end, the Āḻvār is only filling up a gap, the other end being always kept up by Lakṣmaṇa, ever in the Lord’s service.




## 8.3.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

என்றே என்னை உன்ஏர்ஆர்கோலத்திருந்து அடிக்கீழ்  
நின்றே ஆட்செய்ய நீகொண்டருள நினைப்பதுதான்  
குன்றுஏழ் பார்ஏழ் சூழ்கடல்ஞாலம் முழுஏழும்  
நின்றே தாவிய நீள்கழல் ஆழித் திருமாலே!

eṉṟē eṉṉai uṉērārkōlattiruntu aṭikkīḻ  
niṉṟē āṭceyya nīkoṇṭaruḷa niṉaippatutāṉ  
kuṉṟuēḻ pārēḻ cūḻkaṭalñālam muḻuēḻum  
niṉṟē tāviya nīḷkaḻal āḻit tirumālē!

**English translation of verse 8.3.8:**

Oh, Tirumāl, wielding the discus, when will You deem me fit  
To get a lift unto your extremely lovely feet  
And serve You firm and steadfast, for ever?  
Merely standing on Your feet tall, you did cover  
The worlds seven, islands seven, mountains seven and the oceans round about.

**Notes:**

Seeing that there is none to plead with the Lord on his behalf, the Āḻvār himself now enquires of the Lord what exactly His intentions are in the matter of taking service from him. The Āḻvār sees in front of him the Lord, full of love, ready to concede his wish and yet, the Āḻvār can brook no further delay. He impresses upon the Lord his rapturous love unto His ornamental feet, so very alluring that He cannot bear being apart from Him, any longer. The Āḻvār longs to render selfless service unto the Lord, with single-minded devotion and with no break, remaining by His side always. The Lord, however, keeps silent and this makes the Āḻvār suspect whether the Lord insists on the necessary attainment in him to warrant such an aspiration. Reference to the Lord measuring all the worlds, setting his feet on all and sundries, is, therefore, significant. Did He not set His feet on one and all, high and low, unsolicited, caring least for their attainments? As a matter of fact, the Āḻvār is bound to serve the Lord, out of gratitude for His condescending to come all the way to Tiruvaṇparicāram. It further behoves him to go the whole hog out to serve the Lord and get Him fully relaxed after His arduous spanning of the worlds, setting His tender feet over hill and dale, full of rubbles and brambles. And yet, the initiative for this should come from the Lord and the Āḻvār is eagerly awaiting the day when He would invite him to do His bidding.




## 8.3.9
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

திருமால் நான்முகன் செஞ்சடையான் என்றுஇவர்கள் எம்  
பெருமான் தன்மையை யார் அறிகிற்பார்? பேசிஎன்  
ஒருமாமுதல்வா! ஊழிப்பிரான் என்னை ஆளுடைக்  
கருமாமேனியன்! என்பன் என்காதல் கலக்கவே.

tirumāl nāṉmukaṉ ceñcaṭaiyāṉ eṉṟuivarkaḷ em  
perumāṉ taṉmaiyai yār aṟikiṟpār? pēcieṉ  
orumāmutalvā! ūḻippirāṉ eṉṉai āḷuṭaik  
karumāmēṉiyaṉ! eṉpaṉ eṉkātal kalakkavē.

**English translation of verse 8.3.9:**

Tirumāl, can either Nānmukaṉ or the one with matted locks red  
Comprehend Your tenderness?’tis indeed no good  
Talking about this; with a mind by deep love confounded,  
I keep saying, You are the Primate unique, my Lord,  
Time and all else are by You controlled  
And so on, by Your exquisite Form of bluish tint enthralled.

**Notes:**

On the Āḻvār being told by the Lord that there is hardly any room for the fears entertained by him regarding His safety, when the four-headed Brahmā and a host of other Devas were there to attend on Him, the Āḻvār rebuts this position. He points out that they are not the persons to appreciate Him, in terms of His remarkable tenderness and bewitching Form, being mere self-centred boon-seekers. Even he (Āḻvār), soaked in God-love, could only touch a fringe of the Lord's tenderness of Form and keep on uttering a few things over and over again, in the exuberance of love for Him and do nothing more. Neither the self-seeking Devas nor the love-intoxicated Āḻvār is, therefore, up to the mark in the matter of expressing solicitude for the Lord’s well-being.




## 8.3.10
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கலக்கம் இல்லா நல்தவமுனிவர் கரைகண்டோர்  
துளக்கம் இல்லா வானவர் எல்லாம் தொழுவார்கள்  
மலக்கம் எய்த மாகடல்தன்னைக் கடைந்தானை  
உலக்க நாம் புகழ்கிற்பது என்செய்வது உரையீரே.

kalakkam illā naltavamuṉivar karaikaṇṭōr  
tuḷakkam illā vāṉavar ellām toḻuvārkaḷ  
malakkam eyta mākaṭaltaṉṉaik kaṭaintāṉai  
ulakka nām pukaḻkiṟpatu eṉceyvatu uraiyīrē.

**English translation of verse 8.3.10:**

There are the sages great with perfect clarity of mind,  
The released Souls and Eternal Heroes of Heaven to attend  
And dote on the Lord, who the mighty ocean churned;  
Say then, if we frail beings can at all comprehend  
His glory great, seeing that unto it there is no end.

**Notes:**

It was only when the Lord finally brought home the fact, quite reassuring, that He was carefully attended upon by the most eminent sages like Sanaka, Nandana and others, the ‘Muktas’, released from the bondage of samsāra and the ‘Nityas’, the Eternal Heroes in Heaven, and, above all, His own prowess unlimited, the Āḻvār’s fears were set at naught. But then, it might be asked whether this was not already known to the Āḻvār, endowed by the Lord with perfect knowledge. The love-intoxicated Āḻvār just didn’t know when and what could be the source of his anxiety about the Lord’s well-being and when and how such anxiety would get cleared, as the illustrious Nampiḷḷai would put it.




## 8.3.11
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

உரையா வெம்நோய்தவிர அருள் நீள்முடியானை  
வரையார்மாடம் மன்னு குருகூர்ச் சடகோபன்  
உரையேய் சொல்தொடை ஓர்ஆயிரத்துள் இப்பத்தும்  
நிரையே வல்லார் நீடு உலகத்துப் பிறவாரே. (2)

uraiyā vemnōytavira aruḷ nīḷmuṭiyāṉai  
varaiyārmāṭam maṉṉu kurukūrc caṭakōpaṉ  
uraiyēy coltoṭai ōrāyirattuḷ ippattum  
niraiyē vallār nīṭu ulakattup piṟavārē. (2)

**English translation of verse 8.3.11:**

Those that learn well these songs ten,  
Out of the thousand divine songs of Caṭakōpaṉ,  
Hailing from Kurukūr with its castles tall,  
In adoration of the Lord wearing the crown tall.  
Who did his parlous fears about Him quell,  
Will never in this sprawling world be reborn.

**Notes:**

The benefit accruing from learning well this decad as set out above, is self-explanatory. It is, of course, not mere freedom from rebirth in this wretched land where there is none who would feel concerned about the Lord’s safety and well-being but also eternal enjoyment in Heaven where the whole lot of them are dedicated to the Lord’s well-being. As regards the reference in this song to the tall crown of the Sovereign Lord, here is a juicy interpretation furnished by a preceptor, named, Ammaṅki Ammāl:

“The Lord would appear to have nodded His crowned head, by way of assuring the Āḻvār about fulfilling his desire.” The fulfilment of the Āḻvār’s desire in this context, would mean exhibiting unto him the band of devotees who would attend on the Lord and do His behest, such as following Him, carrying His bow and arrows etc., thereby curing him of his erstwhile fears regarding the Lord’s loneliness, unaided and unattended.
