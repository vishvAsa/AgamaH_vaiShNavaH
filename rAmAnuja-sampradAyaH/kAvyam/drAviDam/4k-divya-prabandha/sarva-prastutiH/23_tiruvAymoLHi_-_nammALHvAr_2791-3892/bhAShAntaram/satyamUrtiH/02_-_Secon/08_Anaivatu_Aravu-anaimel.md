## 00 Intro2.8
In the last decad, the Āḻvār was overwhelmed by the Lord’s extraordinary benevolence which did not stop with him aloṇe but overflowed its continents and extended to those connected with him, seven generations, back and forth. In other words, the heavenly bliss enjoyed by the ‘*Nityās*’ in Heaven could be shared by him and his associates, right here. In his boundless compassion for the suffering humanity, caught up in the vortex of worldly life and sensual pleasures, the Āḻvār would naturally like to seize this golden opportunity and get the area of benevolence extended, by getting the ‘*Samsārīs*’ (worldlings) also associated with him as fellow-devotees. And so, he turns round and advises them to get into the Divine fold, seeing that the Lord is the one and only granter of Mokṣa, the final bliss, ridding them of the terrific involvement in worldly life, with its dreadful cycle of birth and death. It may be recalled that, once before, vide 1-2, the Āḻvār addressed the fellowbeings with whom he wished to share all that exalted knowledge about the Divine order, imparted to him by a self-revealing God.

The earlier Ācāryas had held that, in this decad, the Āḻvār propagates the Lord’s Supremacy. But Śrī Parāśara Bhaṭṭar was inclined to think that the Lord’s prowess of granting ‘Mokṣa’ is being talked about in this decad. As a matter of fact, the Lord’s Supremacy has been dealt with in this very centum, in the Second decad, and there is no need to repeat it here so soon. Further, this decad is replete with expressions relating to the grant of Mokṣa. In any case, it makes no difference either way, as God-head (‘*Īśvaratva*) and the prerogative of granting Mokṣa (*Mokṣa-pradatva*) go hand in hand, vested solely in the Supreme Lord.

Towards the end of this decad, as can be seen from stanza ten, the Āḻvār, however, feels frustrated by the unresponsive world around, jogging on in just the same way as before, all his advice having fallen on deaf ears, like the advice tendered by Mālyavāṉ and others to Rāvaṇa. The Āḻvār would, therefore, profitably revert to the enjoyment of the Lord as before, which got interrupted for a while because of his misplaced sympathy for those around, totally impervious to his wholesome advice. At the same time, it was no mean consolation for him. that; in the process, he escaped getting contaminated by them and becoming one of them, Great indeed is his jubilation that he could still retain, *in fact*, the priceless wealth of God-love and God-enjoyment, like that of a person who clears a dacoit-infested area without being robbed and molested.




## 2.8.1
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அணைவது அரவு அணைமேல் பூம்பாவை ஆகம்  
புணர்வது, இருவர் அவர் முதலும் தானே,  
இணைவன் ஆம் எப் பொருட்கும் வீடு முதல் ஆம்,  
புணைவன் பிறவிக்கடல் நீந்துவார்க்கே.

aṇaivatu aravu aṇaimēl pūmpāvai ākam  
puṇarvatu, iruvar avar mutalum tāṉē,  
iṇaivaṉ ām ep poruṭkum vīṭu mutal ām,  
puṇaivaṉ piṟavikkaṭal nīntuvārkkē.

**English translation of verse 2.8.1:**

The Supreme Lord who does on serpent-bed repose  
And hold Pūmpāvai (Lakṣmī, the lotus-born) in embrace  
Is Progenitor of them both (Brahmā and Śiva); He freely descends  
Among all and sundry, Granter of Mokṣa, the raft (sure and certain)  
He is, to swim across (Saṃsāra) the difficult and dreadful ocean.

**Notes**

\(i\) This stanza is an epitome of the contents of this decad.

\(ii\) The first two lines of the stanza bring out the setting in the Eternal land of absolute bliss (*Nitya Vibhūti*). So far as the “*Līlā Vibhūti* (Sportive Universe) is concerned, the Lord is depicted as the originator of one and all, including those two calling for special attention, the exalted Brahmā and Rudra and yet He incarnates among all and sundries, as if He is of their own species and mingles with them freely.

Being the granter of Mokṣa, He is the raft, safe and sound, to get hold of for those who are keen on crossing the ocean of ‘Saṃsāra’ with its terrific involvement in the cycle of birth and death and seek His help, finding that, by themselves, they can hardly cross this ocean, vast and deep.




## 2.8.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நீந்தும் துயர்ப் பிறவி உட்பட மற்று எவ் எவையும்,  
நீந்தும் துயர் இல்லா வீடு முதல் ஆம்,  
பூந் தண் புனல் பொய்கை யானை இடர் கடிந்த,  
பூந் தண் துழாய் என் தனி நாயகன் புணர்ப்பே.

nīntum tuyarp piṟavi uṭpaṭa maṟṟu ev evaiyum,  
nīntum tuyar illā vīṭu mutal ām,  
pūn taṇ puṉal poykai yāṉai iṭar kaṭinta,  
pūn taṇ tuḻāy eṉ taṉi nāyakaṉ puṇarppē.

**English translation of verse 2.8.2:**

Contact with my unique Lord, wearing tulacī garland Cool and nice, the Redeemer of the elephant, In great distress, in the cool and lovely pond, Will help to ford “Saṃsāra”, the dreadful ocean, The breeder of all ills and attain the blissful heaven.

**Notes**

\(i\) In this stanza, the Āḻvār says that the Lord, as such, is not necessary for the attainment of Mokṣa and some kind of contact with Him will suffice. Such a contact will help one both ways, namely, obtaining relief from the otherwise incurable maladies of birth etc, and attaining the ‘Eternal Land’ of absolute bliss without the slightest tinge of sorrow.

\(ii\) Swimming across the ocean of *Saṃsāra* is a never-ending process; if the ocean is interminably vast, the swimming also is interminably long, a perennial process. It is only the Lord’s redemptive grace flowing through contact with Him, in some form, that will cut the gordian knot and take one out of this otherwise unfordable ocean.




## 2.8.3
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

புணர்க்கும் அயன் ஆம் அழிக்கும் அரன் ஆம்,  
புணர்த்த தன் உந்தியொடு ஆகத்து மன்னி,  
புணர்த்த திருஆகித் தன் மார்வில் தான்சேர்,  
புணர்ப்பன் பெரும் புணர்ப்பு எங்கும் புலனே.

puṇarkkum ayaṉ ām aḻikkum araṉ ām,  
puṇartta taṉ untiyoṭu ākattu maṉṉi,  
puṇartta tiruākit taṉ mārvil tāṉcēr,  
puṇarppaṉ perum puṇarppu eṅkum pulaṉē.

**English translation of verse 2.8.3:**

The Lord is (also) ‘Ayaṉ’ who from His ṇavei emerged  
And created the worlds, on His person duly lodged,  
And ‘Araṉ’, the destroyer too; on His winsome chest  
There’s Tiru; perceptible indeed are His herculean tasks many.

**Note**

The Supreme Lord not only discharges the functions of ‘Ayaṉ’ (Brahmā), the Creator and ‘Araṉ’ (Śiva), the destroyer, standing within them as their Internal Controller but also assigns specific portions of His body for their occupation. And then, there is ‘Tiru’ (Lakṣmī), inseparably lodged on His winsome chest. And then, He reposes on the vast expanse of water, contemplating the ensuing creation of the universe. The herculean deeds performed by Him through




## 2.8.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

புலன் ஐந்து மேயும் பொறி ஐந்தும் நீங்கி,  
நலம் அந்தம் இல்லது ஓர் நாடு புகுவீர்,  
அலமந்து வீய அசுரரைச் செற்றான்,  
பலம் முந்து சீரில் படிமின் ஒவாதே.

pulaṉ aintu mēyum poṟi aintum nīṅki,  
nalam antam illatu ōr nāṭu pukuvīr,  
alamantu vīya acuraraic ceṟṟāṉ,  
palam muntu cīril paṭimiṉ ovātē.

**English translation of verse 2.8.4:**

Those of you who the interplay want to quell,  
Of the senses and sense-objects, so as to enter  
The Eternal Land of perfect bliss, will do well  
To enjoy the traits auspicious of the Lord, for ever;  
How He tortured and slew the Asuras, think it over.

**Notes**

\(i\) Here is the Āḻvār’s recipe for discarding the sensual pleasures, petty and transient, and entering the Eternal Land of perfect bliss;

> “Be steeped in the enjoyment of His auspicious traits for ever”,

\(ii\) Unlike several other processes which are difficult and tiresome in the initial stages and are pleasurable only in the final stages of fruition, contemplation of the Lord’s auspicious traits is an ecstatic experience, right from the beginning. It is also noteworthy that there are no inhibitions and injunctions restricting such enjoyment to certain days only or parts of the day as in the case of sea-bath etc.

\(iii\) This abode of ours is the harrowing land of eternal miseries whereas the Heaven is just the opposite—the Eternal Land of absolute bliss. The Āḻvār does not subscribe to the doctrine of philosophy which conceives of ‘Mokṣa’, as but the mere disembodiment of the soul on emancipation from the cycle of births and deaths. His concept of ‘Mokṣa’ is the eternal joy of constant service unto the Lord, in the yonder heaven, with no tinge of the erstwhile sorrows, partaking of the bliss of unlimited dimensions, fresh and exquisite, every moment, flowing from the Lord who is an inexhaustible fountain of bliss.

\(iv\) The Lord will destroy our sins and remove all impediment\* in the way of our union with Him, even as He tormented and destroyed the Asuras.




## 2.8.5
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஓவாத் துயர்ப் பிறவி உட்பட மற்று எவ் எவையும்,  
மூவாத் தனி முதலாய் மூவுலகும் காவலோன்,  
மா ஆகி ஆமை ஆய் மீன் ஆகி மானிடம் ஆம்,  
தேவாதி தேவ பெருமான் என் தீர்த்தனே.

ōvāt tuyarp piṟavi uṭpaṭa maṟṟu ev evaiyum,  
mūvāt taṉi mutalāy mūvulakum kāvalōṉ,  
mā āki āmai āy mīṉ āki māṉiṭam ām,  
tēvāti tēva perumāṉ eṉ tīrttaṉē.

**English translation of verse 2.8.5:**

The Supreme Lord, the causeless cause of the flowing universe,  
Its creation, sustentation and destruction, Chief of the Celestials,  
My Tīrttaṉ (Who sanctified me) did come down as a Horse,  
Tortoise, Fish and Man, and protected the worlds, one and all.

**Note**

The routine of the Universe falling under the three major compartments of creation, preservation and dissolution, goes on uninterruptedly because of the ever-alert and omnipotent Lord who directs and controls them all. No doubt, He dowered on all of us, limbs and sense-organs to put us on a career of gainful activity with a view to attaining Him, but even if we stray away from Him He is such an indefatigable cultivator who doesn’t lose heart when the yield is low or next to nothing, but goes on with His cultivation, hoping for better days. That is why He takes all the trouble to incarnate in various forms and goes on with His work of resuscitation.




## 2.8.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

தீர்த்தன் உலகு அளந்த சேவடிமேல் பூந்தாமம்,  
சேர்த்தி அவையே சிவன் முடிமேல் தான் கண்டு,  
பார்த்தன் தெளிந்தொழிந்த பைந்துழாயான் பெருமை,  
பேர்த்தும் ஒருவரால் பேசக் கிடந்ததே?

tīrttaṉ ulaku aḷanta cēvaṭimēl pūntāmam,  
cērtti avaiyē civaṉ muṭimēl tāṉ kaṇṭu,  
pārttaṉ teḷintoḻinta paintuḻāyāṉ perumai,  
pērttum oruvarāl pēcak kiṭantatē?

**English translation of verse 2.8.6:**

Is there any need at all for others to deliberate  
The glory of (Lord Kṛṣṇa) wearing tulacī garland, Tīrttaṉ (The Immaculate),  
At whose lovely feet which spanned the Universe, Pārttaṉ placed a garland  
And saw it (a little later) on Śiva’s head, getting clarity of mind?

**Note**

In the battle against the “Kauravas Arjuṉa needed the weapon known as ‘Pāśupada astra’ which could be had from Śiva after due propitiation. The compassionate Kṛṣṇa, however, told Arjuṉa the short-cut whereby he could offer at the former’s feet the garland intended for Paśupati (Śiva). Arjuṉa did accordingly and that very night, Śiva appeared in Arjuṉa’s dream, wearing that very same garland on the head and presented the weapon in question. Reference has been made, in this song, to the spanning of the whole Universe by the Lord as it was then that Brahmā washed the Lord’s feet to the accompaniment of Vedic chantings, and the sacred water that flowed down the Lord’s feet was held by Śiva on his head (Nāṉmukaṉ Tiruvantāti-9). Is there at all any need to dispute the self-evident glory of Lord Kṛṣṇa?




## 2.8.7
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கிடந்து இருந்து நின்று அளந்து கேழல் ஆய் கீழ்ப் புக்கு  
இடந்திடும், தன்னுள் கரக்கும் உமிழும்,  
தடம் பெருந் தோள் ஆரத் தழுவும் பார் என்னும்  
மடந்தையை, மால் செய்கின்ற, மால் ஆர் காண்பாரே?

kiṭantu iruntu niṉṟu aḷantu kēḻal āy kīḻp pukku  
iṭantiṭum, taṉṉuḷ karakkum umiḻum,  
taṭam perun tōḷ ārat taḻuvum pār eṉṉum  
maṭantaiyai, māl ceykiṉṟa, māl ār kāṇpārē?

**English translation of verse 2.8.7:**

Lying, sitting and standing, measuring the worlds,  
Getting into the waters deep and lifting up the Earth,  
As the Boar gigantic, holding with Him all the worlds  
And then spitting them out, embracing dame Earth  
On His broad shoulders complacent, who can comprehend His love for Mother earth?

**Notes**

\(i\) Many indeed are the wondrous deeds of the Lord, done out of His great love for Mother Earth, the Sportive universe (*Līlā vibhūti*).

\(ii\) *Lying, sitting and standing*:

There are several ways of appreciating these postures of the Lord. These are set out below:

> \(a\) *Reclining* on the Milk-ocean, the centre of creative activity,
> surrounded by the band of celestials;  
> *Sitting* on the serpent couch in the High Heaven;  
> *Standing* firm on Mount Tirūvēṅkaṭam, His favourite resort.
>
> (*c) Lying* prostrate in front of the Ocean, Śrī Rāma’s supplication
> to the king of the ocean;  
> *Sitting* (Staying) in the Āśramas of the Mahaṛṣīs during His exile;  
> *Standing* victorious at the gates of Laṅkā after slaying Rāvaṇa (may
> also refer to Śrī Rāma standing victorious after slaying vāli).
>
> \(c\) *Lying* in the pilgrim centre known as Puḷiṅkuṭi.  
> *Sitting* in the pilgrim centre known as Varakuṇamaṅkai.  
> *Standing* in the pilgrim centre known as *Śrīvaikuṇṭam*.
>
> \(a\) above refers to the Lord’s transcendent glory;  
> (b) above refers to the Lord’s ‘Saulabhya’ (easy accessibility) in His
> Incarnate form,  
> (c) refers to the Lord’s iconic manifestation in these different
> postures in the respective pilgrim centres. See also notes under
> V-10-6.




## 2.8.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

காண்பார் ஆர்? எம் ஈசன் கண்ணனை என்காணுமாறு,?  
ஊண் பேசில் எல்லா உலகும் ஓர் துற்று ஆற்றா,  
சேணபாலவீடோ உயிரோ மற்று எப் பொருட்கும்,  
ஏண் பாலும் சோரான் பரந்து உளன் ஆம் எங்குமே.

kāṇpār ār? em īcaṉ kaṇṇaṉai eṉkāṇumāṟu,?  
ūṇ pēcil ellā ulakum ōr tuṟṟu āṟṟā,  
cēṇapālavīṭō uyirō maṟṟu ep poruṭkum,  
ēṇ pālum cōrāṉ parantu uḷaṉ ām eṅkumē.

**English translation of verse 2.8.8:**

Who can comprehend Kaṇṇaṉ, my Lord  
Or get at the know-how? hardly a morsel  
Of His food can all the worlds be, His abode  
Is high above the worlds, Inner Controller of all.  
Indeed He pervades all over  
With no exception whatever.

**Notes**

\(i\) It is indeed impossible for any one to gauge the full extent of the Lord’s glory; even the exalted ones who are endowed with the capacity to delve into it, are not equal to the task. They too could touch only a fringe of it, just a peep, and no more.

\(ii\) All along, reference was made to the Lord containing within His stomach, eating up all the worlds, during the period of deluge, making it appear to be a herculean task of gigantic magnitude. Now, it will be seen that all the worlds put together hardly constitute a morsel of food for the Lord, a mere fleebite [flea-bite].




## 2.8.9
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

எங்கும் உளன் கண்ணன் என்ற மகனைக் காய்ந்து,  
இங்கு இல்லையால் என்று இரணியன் தூண் புடைப்ப,  
அங்கு அப்பொழுதே அவன் வீயத் தோன்றிய, என்  
சிங்கப் பிரான் பெருமை ஆராயும் சீர்மைத்தே?

eṅkum uḷaṉ kaṇṇaṉ eṉṟa makaṉaik kāyntu,  
iṅku illaiyāl eṉṟu iraṇiyaṉ tūṇ puṭaippa,  
aṅku appoḻutē avaṉ vīyat tōṉṟiya, eṉ  
ciṅkap pirāṉ perumai ārāyum cīrmaittē?

**English translation of verse 2.8.9:**

The son affirmed, ‘Kaṇṇaṉ is everywhere  
Shouted back irate Iraṇiyaṉ, “If he be not here?”  
And slapped the pillar hard; there and then  
The Lord appeared and killed the demon;  
Indeed, my Naraciṅka’s glory is beyond deliberation.

**Notes**

\(i\) In the preceding Song, the Lord’s immanence was referred to. Perhaps, it didn’t carry conviction with quite a few persons who doubted whether the Lord could pervade all over, in and out. This song is evidently addressed to those persons, warning them not to follow in the foot-steps of Hiraṇya and come to grief.

\(ii\) Hiraṇya slapped, with his own hand, a pillar built under his own supervision. There was, therefore, hardly any question of magic or sleight of hand which produced the furious Narasiṅga, right from the bosom of that very pillar, from the very spot on which Hiraṇya slapped that very moment. The points to be pondered over in this context are: Had the Lord not appeared from the crucial spot tapped by Hiraṇya or if His appearance had been delayed by even a split second, His immanence at all places and at all times would be open to question. His omnipresence having been established, His omnipotence needs to be demonstrated. If it is said that Narasiṅga was born, He was not born in the generally accepted sense of impregnation, birth, growth and all that. He jumped out of the ripped-open pillar, as a full- grown adult, a peculiar combination of Man and Lion, more than a match for the formidable Hiraṇya. Strange indeed were the boons conferred on Hiraṇya by Brahmā—the devil was not to meet with death at the hands of a male, female or a hermophrodite, neither by Gods nor by man or beast or any of the five elements, neither by day nor by night, neither in space nor on the ground, neither inside the house nor outside, so on and so forth. The Strange Visitor who sprang forth engaged Hiraṇya, in a *hand to hand fight*, dragged him on to the *door-step*, laid him on His *lap* and tore open his bowels with the *finger nails* (spear-like claws), at *dusk*. Hiraṇya, the seemingly impregnable fortress, armed in a thousand and one ways against every conceivable source of danger, crashed, at long last, before the superior might of the Omnipotent Lord. The words in italics, as above, will show that none of the boons granted to Hiraṇya was violated.




## 2.8.10
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

சீர்மை கொள் வீடு சுவர்க்கம் நரகு ஈறா,  
ஈர்மை கொள் தேவர் நடுவா மற்று எப் பொருட்கும்,  
வேர் முதல் ஆய் வித்து ஆய் பரந்து தனி நின்ற,  
கார் முகில் போல் வண்ணன் என் கண்ணனை நான் கண்டேனே.

cīrmai koḷ vīṭu cuvarkkam naraku īṟā,  
īrmai koḷ tēvar naṭuvā maṟṟu ep poruṭkum,  
vēr mutal āy vittu āy parantu taṉi niṉṟa,  
kār mukil pōl vaṇṇaṉ eṉ kaṇṇaṉai nāṉ kaṇṭēṉē.

**English translation of verse 2.8.10:**

Seen have I kaṇṇaṉ, my cloud-hued Lord, of unique excellence,  
All pervading, He is the triple cause of all existence,  
Ushering in the exalted Heaven, Svarg and hell, the respective denizens,  
The kind-hearted Devas and all else.

**Notes**

\(i\) As already mentioned in the preamble to this decad, the Āḻvār finds, at this stage, the people around, most unresponsive, all his advice having fallen on deaf ears. Frustrated though, he is still happy that he didn’t get contaminated by them and become one of them, very much like clearing a dacoit-infested area without getting robbed or molested.

\(ii\) The Lord combines in Himself all the three causes of existence, the *material* (upādāna) *Instrumental* (Sahakāri) and the *operative* (nimitta) causes. For making pots, mud is the material cause, the potter’s wheel and staff, the Instrumental cause, and the Potter is the operative cause. So far as the creation of this world is concerned, all the three causes vest in the Lord, yet another unique feature of the Lord. Apart from this universal aspect, the Lord regales the denizens of the high heaven with the exquisite charm of His transcendent Form, and He has now chosen to present Himself unto the Āḻvār as the charming Kṛṣṇa. Great indeed is the Āḻvār’s joy.




## 2.8.11
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கண் தலங்கள் செய்ய கரு மேனி அம்மானை,  
வண்டு அலம்பும் சோலை வழுதி வள நாடன்,  
பண் தலையில் சொன்ன தமிழ் ஆயிரத்து இப் பத்தும் வலார்,

**English translation of verse 2.8.11:**

Those that learn these songs ten  
Out of the thousand composed in choice tunes,  
By (Caṭakōpaṉ), Chief of Vaḻutināṭu, abounding in fertile orchards,  
Where go gay honey bees in their swarms,  
Adoring the black-hued, large lotus-eyed Lord,  
Will in high Heaven flourish and partake of bliss supreme.

**Note**

The chanters of this decad will shoot up from the harrowing depths of worldly existence to an exalted position in heaven, keeping at their beck and call, the denizens over there.
