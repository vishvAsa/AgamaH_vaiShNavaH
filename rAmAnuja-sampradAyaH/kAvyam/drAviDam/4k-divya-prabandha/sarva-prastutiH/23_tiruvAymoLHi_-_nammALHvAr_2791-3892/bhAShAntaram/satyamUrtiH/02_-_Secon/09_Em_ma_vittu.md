## 00 Intro2.9
This decad pinpoints the concept of ‘*Puriṣārtha*’ the ultimate value of the final goal of every individual. In the preceding decad, frequent references were made by the Āḻvār to the Eternal Land of absolute bliss. On hearing these, the Lord thought He would rather put the Āḻvār in Heaven if that was all His desire and accordingly told him, “Well, you can have the Mokṣa, as desired”, It is now and here that the position gets crystallised. The Āḻvār revolves in his mind and concludes that any thing granted by the Lord, by way of catering to his desire instead of His own, is not worth having, and even heaven attained this way, would be little better than hell. The real ‘*Puruṣārtḥa*’, or ultimate value lies in whatever is bestowed by the Lord out of His own free grace and liking.

And so, the Āḻvār speaks out his mind, as follows:

> “My Lord, it makes absolutely no difference to me whether 1 am in
> heaven as the partaker of the endless bliss there or in the state of
> *Kaivaḻya*, lost in self-enjoyment or get consigned to the gloomy
> abyss, if it is all your sweet will and dispensation. On the other
> hand, I will not hesitate to decline even the gift of heaven, if it is
> bestowed on me just for my gratification. And so, may it please you to
> so ordain my goal as to make it coincide solely with your desire”.

Here is a clear enunciation of the paramountcy of the Lord’s will, in total subjugation of the egoistic compulsions of the Individual. It is indeed very hard to find the Subject who can appreciate and fall in line with the Āḻvār’s lofty train of thought, totally bereft of egoistic impulses and putting his whole weight on the Lord. It was for this very reason that Empār, the great preceptor, is said to have screened his audience and closed the gates of the lecture hall before discoursing on this decad.




## 2.9.1
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

எம்மாவீட்டுத் திறமும் செப்பம், நின்  
செம்மா பாடபற்புத் தலைசேர்த்து ஒல்லை,-  
கைம்மா துன்பம் கடிந்த பிரானே,  
அம்மா அடியேன் வேண்டுவது ஈதே.

emmāvīṭṭut tiṟamum ceppam, niṉ  
cemmā pāṭapaṟput talaicērttu ollai,-  
kaimmā tuṉpam kaṭinta pirāṉē,  
ammā aṭiyēṉ vēṇṭuvatu ītē.

**English translation of verse 2.9.1:**

You relieved the distress of an elephant, benevolent Lord!  
If you’d only soon set your grand lotus feet red  
On my head, the topic of high heaven I shall not moot,  
Sire, this is all I pray for, nothing more do I want.

**Note**

Right in the beginning of this song, the Āḻvār makes his position abundantly clear. He shall no longer mention about the high heaven, be it a matter of assuming a form like unto that of God (Sārūpya), staying in the same area as the seat of the Lord’s kingdom in heaven (sālokya) etc. All that he needs is that the Lord should set His lovely pair of red lotus feet on his head.




## 2.9.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஈதே யான் உன்னைக் கொள்வது எஞ்ஞான்றும், என்  
மை தோய் சோதி மணிவண்ண எந்தாய்,  
எய்தா நின் கழல் யான் எய்த, ஞானக்  
கைதா காலக் கழிவு செய்யேலே.

ītē yāṉ uṉṉaik koḷvatu eññāṉṟum, eṉ  
mai tōy cōti maṇivaṇṇa entāy,  
eytā niṉ kaḻal yāṉ eyta, ñāṉak  
kaitā kālak kaḻivu ceyyēlē.

**English translation of verse 2.9.2:**

My lovely Lord, lustrous like the dark blue gem,  
All that I pray unto you now and at all times.  
Is that you do lend me the hand of wisdom,  
To reach your feet, difficult to attain, with no loss of time.

**Notes**

\(i\) In the preceding song, the Āḻvār had categorically stated that he wanted nothing more than the Lord’s lovely pair of lotus feet being set firmly on his head. And yet, the Lord tempts the Āḻvār and asks him whether he would want anything more. The Āḻvār, however, stands his ground, all right and reaffirms that he wants nothing else.

*Lord*: Well, how long will you persevere in this attitude?” *Āḻvār*: “As long as you and I exist”.

*Lord*: “What made you so steadfast?”

*Āḻvār*: “Your exquisite charm”.

*Lord*: “And what should I do now?”

*Āḻvār*: “Pray, deign to make this vassal, your sole dependent, get at your lovely pair of feet, difficult to attain”.

\(ii\) About the lending of the hand of wisdom, here is an anecdote, very instructive.

Mutaliyāṇṭāṉ and Empār were colleagues and co-disciples of Śrī Rāmānuja. During a fairly long spell of absence of the former from Śrīraṅgam, a disciple of his stayed with Empār. One of those days, quite a few disciples of Empār were administered by him the five-fold sacraments enjoined for Śrī Vaiṣṇavas. The aforesaid disciple of Mutaliyāṇṭāṉ also got the sacraments from Empār along with the others. To an enquiry by Empār, whether the disciple in question had spiritual relationship with any other Preceptor, the answer was assuring enough and indicated that there was no other spiritual mentor. But then, when Mutaliyāṇṭāṉ returned to Śrīraṅgam, this particular disciple went back to him, and served him as before. When Empār got to know of this, he hurried to Mutaliyāṇṭāṉ and expressed regret for the administration of the Sacraments to the disciple in question during Āṇṭāṉ’s absence from the station. But Āṇṭāṉ’s magnanimity put Empār at ease, in no time. The former observed: “If two persons stretch out their hands to one fallen into a well, it is so much the easier both for the riser and the raisers”. The helping hand, in this case, refers to the spiritual knowledge imparted by both the preceptors.




## 2.9.3
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

செய்யேல் தீவினை என்று அருள் செய்யும், என்  
கை ஆர் சக்கரக் கண்ண பிரானே,  
ஐ ஆர் கண்டம் அடைக்கிலும் நின் கழல்  
எய்யாது ஏத்த, அருள்செய் எனக்கே.

ceyyēl tīviṉai eṉṟu aruḷ ceyyum, eṉ  
kai ār cakkarak kaṇṇa pirāṉē,  
ai ār kaṇṭam aṭaikkilum niṉ kaḻal  
eyyātu ētta, aruḷcey eṉakkē.

**English translation of verse 2.9.3:**

Kaṇṇā, my benefactor, wielding the discus bright,  
‘Tis your grace that I from evil deeds desist;  
Bless me that I shall adore, without respite,  
Your comely feet even when phlegm chokes my throat tight.

**Note**

Alvar to the Lord:

> “I pray not for relief from sufferings but for a mind rivetted to your
> feet at all times, even in those dark moments when the throat gets
> choked by phlegm”.

C.f. the 12th Jitante śloka (recited at the conclusion of the worship of the household Deity)

Which means:

> “Whatever calamities might befall me, let not my mind be apart from
> you; this would be enough to salve me”. (2-9-4)




## 2.9.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

எனக்கே ஆட்செய் எக்காலத்தும் என்று, என்  
மனக்கே வந்து இடைவீடு இன்றி மன்னி,  
தனக்கே ஆக எனைக் கொள்ளும் ஈதே,  
எனக்கே கண்ணனை யான் கொள் சிறப்பே.

eṉakkē āṭcey ekkālattum eṉṟu, eṉ  
maṉakkē vantu iṭaivīṭu iṉṟi maṉṉi,  
taṉakkē āka eṉaik koḷḷum ītē,  
eṉakkē kaṇṇaṉai yāṉ koḷ ciṟappē.

**English translation of verse 2.9.4:**

The greatest good I desire from Kaṇṇaṉ, my Lord,  
True to my essential nature, is that command He shall,  
That I serve Him wholly and at all times, and own He shall  
Me as His exclusive vassal, in my mind firmly lodged.

**Notes**

\(i\) This song is the quintessence of this decad, determining, as it does, the greatest good for the individual soul, in keeping with its essential nature, namely, abject dependence on the Lord as His exclusive vassal for all time. For abiding in such a state without the slightest aberration at any time, the Āḻvār seeks the Lord‘s Grace.

\(ii\) Śrī Nampiḷḷai appreciates this decad as the most outstanding, of all the hundred decads (Tiruvāymoḻis) and even so, this song is the best, in this decad, That is because the Āḻvār prays unto the Lord that He should stay inside him, firm and for ever, and take from him service, service exclusively unto Him and at all times, rendered solely for His pleasure, eschewing the slightest tinge of personal egoism, absolutely selfless like the Moon, Southerly breeze, sandal paste and water.

\(iii\) In the learned assembly presided over by Empār, Piḷḷai Tirunarayūr Arayar enquired why the Āḻvār, endowed with full and complete knowledge, clear and concise, should at all make a request of this kind to the Lord, instead of resigning himself wholly to His grace, leaving Him to do whatever He liked. While agreeing with the Arayar that it was a pertinent question, Empār elucidated that it was the innate charm of the destined goal, namely, selfless service unto the Lord for His exclusive enjoyment that drew the Āḻvār out in this manner and made him long for it, even as the Divine Mother, inseparably poised on the Lord’s winsome chest, keeps on saying, “I shall not get parted from my Lord even for a trice”.




## 2.9.5
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

சிறப்பில் வீடு சுவர்க்கம் நரகம்,  
இறப்பில் எய்துக எய்தற்க, யானும்  
பிறப்பு இல் பல் பிறவிப் பெருமானை,  
மறப்பு ஒன்று இன்றி என்றும் மகிழ்வனே.

ciṟappil vīṭu cuvarkkam narakam,  
iṟappil eytuka eytaṟka, yāṉum  
piṟappu il pal piṟavip perumāṉai,  
maṟappu oṉṟu iṉṟi eṉṟum makiḻvaṉē.

**English translation of verse 2.9.5:**

Let me or let me not go, after death,  
To the renowned heaven, the svarga or the hell.  
But may I meditate upon the Lord, Who, though free from birth,  
Chooses to take many a birth, in an unbroken spell,  
Forgetting Him at no time and thus be full of mirth.

**Note**

The Āḻvār’s sole concern is to remain steeped for ever in the enjoyment of the Lord’s wondrous deeds and auspicious traits, displayed during the numerous incarnations taken at His sweet volition.




## 2.9.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மகிழ் கொள் தெய்வம் உலோகம் அலோகம்,  
மகிழ் கொள் சோதி மலர்ந்த அம்மானே,  
மகிழ் கொள் சிந்தை சொல் செய்கை கொண்டு, என்றும்  
மகிழ்வுற்று உன்னை வணங்க வாராயே.

makiḻ koḷ teyvam ulōkam alōkam,  
makiḻ koḷ cōti malarnta ammāṉē,  
makiḻ koḷ cintai col ceykai koṇṭu, eṉṟum  
makiḻvuṟṟu uṉṉai vaṇaṅka vārāyē.

**English translation of verse 2.9.6:**

Oh, Lord, from You blossomed the mirthful Moon and the Sun resplendent,  
The blissful Celestials, mankind with Knowledge radiant,  
The fauna and flora with no such radiance, pray appear before me  
That I may worship you ever, by word, deed and thought gaily.

**Note**

Āḻvār to the Lord: My Lord, you made the celestials, full of bliss, the mankind, radiant with knowledge, the luminous Sun aṇd Moon as well as the non-sentient beings, devoid of knowledge. You, who could create this Kaleidoscopic Universe, can surely make me enjoy you wholly, by word, deed and thought and, for this purpose, you should be before me, at all times.




## 2.9.7
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வாராய் உன் திருப் பாத மலர்க்கீழ்ப்,  
பேராதே யான் வந்து அடையும்படி  
தாராதாய், உன்னை என்னுள் வைப்பில் என்றும்  
ஆராதாய், எனக்கு என்றும் எக்காலே.

vārāy uṉ tirup pāta malarkkīḻp,  
pērātē yāṉ vantu aṭaiyumpaṭi  
tārātāy, uṉṉai eṉṉuḷ vaippil eṉṟum  
ārātāy, eṉakku eṉṟum ekkālē.

**English translation of verse 2.9.7:**

Oh, Lord, You haven’t granted me the favour  
Of attaining your lotus feet for ever;  
However long I wrap You in my mind, non-satiate you are,  
Pray appear before me, for my eyes to feast for ever.

**Note**

The Āḻvār feels that, having whetted his God-thirst and God-hunger, it was but meet that the Lord should appear before him for his eyes to continually drink deep of His nectarean beauty.




## 2.9.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

எக்காலத்து எந்தையாய் என்னுள் மன்னில், மற்று  
எக் காலத்திலும் யாதொன்றும் வேண்டேன்,  
மிக்கார் வேத விமலர் விழுங்கும், என்  
அக்காரக் கனியே உன்னை யானே.

ekkālattu entaiyāy eṉṉuḷ maṉṉil, maṟṟu  
ek kālattilum yātoṉṟum vēṇṭēṉ,  
mikkār vēta vimalar viḻuṅkum, eṉ  
akkārak kaṉiyē uṉṉai yāṉē.

**English translation of verse 2.9.8:**

You, Vedic scholars of rank and repute do (with love) devour,  
Oh, my candy- fruit, my eternal Master,  
If you shall my mind enter and stay there, firm and secure,  
Never shall I from you seek any other favour, (be sure).

**Notes**

\(i\) Rock-candy is a delicious product of cane-juice and it is the Āḻvār’s figment of imagination that conceives of the Lord being as delicious as the fruit of the imaginary Rock-candy tree, (akkārakkaṉi is the term used in the original text of this song, to denote this imaginary fruit of an imaginary tree).

\(ii\) The versification, as above, conforms to the interpretation of this song (original) by ‘Emperumāṉār’ (Rāmānuja). Śrī Āḷavantār (Yāmuṉa) would, however, appear to have interpreted this song, as follows:

> “My Lord, if you would only enter my heart, as my Sovereign Master,
> even if it be for a split second, I shall not seek from you any
> favour, at any other time, not even this very favour now sought”.




## 2.9.9
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

யானே என்னை அறியகிலாதே,  
யானே என் தனதே என்று இருந்தேன்,  
யானே நீ என் உடைமையும் நீயே,  
வானே ஏத்தும் எம் வானவர் ஏறே

yāṉē eṉṉai aṟiyakilātē,  
yāṉē eṉ taṉatē eṉṟu iruntēṉ,  
yāṉē nī eṉ uṭaimaiyum nīyē,  
vāṉē ēttum em vāṉavar ēṟē

**English translation of verse 2.9.9:**

Oh, my Lord, by the entire heaven adored!  
Chief of Celestials, Fancied I, in ignorance bred,  
I my master was and all things mine own;  
But now do I realise, all are yours, I and mine.

**Note**

The Lord had done His best, down the ages, to reclaim the Āḻvār but the latter was striking a divergent path all the time, not knowing his essential nature and relationship with God. Prior to his reclamation, the Āḻvār was like unto a Prince, fallen into the hands of a hunter and brought up like the hunter’s son in strange environments, totally alien to his native surroundings. But now true knowledge has dawned on him and he is in a position to advise the people around to disengage themselves from the erroneous notions of ‘I’ and ‘Mine’ and be rooted in the Lord, whose exclusive vassals they are, solely dependent on Him.




## 2.9.10
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஏறேல் ஏழும் வென்று ஏர் கொள் இலங்கையை,  
நீறே செய்த நெடுஞ் சுடர்ச் சோதி,  
தேறேல் என்னை உன் பொன் அடி சேர்த்து ஒல்லை-  
வேறே போக எஞ்ஞான்றும் விடலே.

ēṟēl ēḻum veṉṟu ēr koḷ ilaṅkaiyai,  
nīṟē ceyta neṭuñ cuṭarc cōti,  
tēṟēl eṉṉai uṉ poṉ aṭi cērttu ollai-  
vēṟē pōka eññāṉṟum viṭalē.

**English translation of verse 2.9.10:**

My resplendent Lord; you tamed the seven bulls unruly  
And routed Laṅkā, the city beautiful; trust me not,  
Better take me quick to your golden feet  
And never allow me to slip back to things worldly.

**Note**

*Lord*:

> “Āḻvār, I suppose you are quite safe now and have nothing more to
> fear.”

*Āḻvār*:

> “Sire, you can’t be too certain about me, still in this material body,
> and in these frightful surroundings. Situated as I am, the possibility
> of my going astray and slipping back to old ways cannot be ruled out.
> I cannot, therefore, feel safe unless and until I am laid at your feet
> firmly. To get at me, you can of course root out the impediments even
> as you tamed the unruly bulls and destroyed Laṅkā, to get at Nappiṇṇai
> and Sita respectively.”




## 2.9.11
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

விடல் இல் சக்கரத்து அண்ணலை மேவல்  
விடல் இல் வண் குருகூர்ச் சடகோபன்,  
கெடல் இல் ஆயிரத்துள் இவை பத்தும்,  
கெடல் இல் வீடு செய்யும் கிளர்வார்க்கே.

viṭal il cakkarattu aṇṇalai mēval  
viṭal il vaṇ kurukūrc caṭakōpaṉ,  
keṭal il āyirattuḷ ivai pattum,  
keṭal il vīṭu ceyyum kiḷarvārkkē.

**English translation of verse 2.9.11:**

These songs ten, out of the thousand immortal songs  
Of Kurukūr Caṭakōpaṉ, ever close to the Lord,  
Who the discus inseparable holds, will unto those that sing  
Them ardently, bestow heavenly bliss, from all ills freed.

**Notes**

\(i\) These ten stanzas will confer on those who recite them heavenly bliss. It need not be questioned how these songs could, by themselves, grant Mokṣa, which is the sole prerogative of the Supreme Lord. What is intended to be conveyed by this end-song is that the recital of these ten songs will gladden the Lord and, as a consequence thereof, His gift of Mokṣa will follow. C.f. IV-5-11 where the lotus-born Lakṣmī is said to confer Mokṣa on those who recite the ten stanzas in that decad. Actually, the Lord is the sole Granter of Mokṣa but He grants it only through the instrumentality of Śrī Lakṣmī, as the Grand Intercessor between Man and God and her recommendatory role plays a very vital part in the ascent of Man to the foot-stool of God.

\(ii\) In the last song, the Āḻvār had requested the Lord not to let him slip back to his old ways. The Lord assured the Āḻvār that he need have no misgivings whatsoever and added that it was not for giving up devotees like him that He was carrying in His hand the discus all the time. By implication, He could hold on to His devotee as firmly as He held the discus.
