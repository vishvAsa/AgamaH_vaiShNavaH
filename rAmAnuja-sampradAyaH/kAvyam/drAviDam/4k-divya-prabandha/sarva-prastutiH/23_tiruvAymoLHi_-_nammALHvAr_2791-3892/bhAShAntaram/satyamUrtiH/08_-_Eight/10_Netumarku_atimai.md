## 00 Intro9.10
The subject’s exclusive dependence on the Supreme Lord was emphasised in the last decad. But then, dependence on the Lord could extend upto the Lord’s devotees as well by virtue of His unbounded love for them. This is like our wearing on our heads, the holy sandals of the Lord and swallowing the water obtained by giving them a sacramental bath. Did not Tirumaṅkai Āḻvār declare in VIII-10-3 of his ‘Periya Tirumoḻi’ that, as a result of learning the eight-syllabled Tirumantra, he became a vassal of the devotees of the Lord, enshrined in Tirukkaṇṇapuram? Service unto the Lord’s devotees, the logical culmination of service to the Lord (which is implied in the word ‘namaḥ’, occurring in Tirumantra), is dealt with, in this decad. Actually, the end-song of the last decad has already set the pace for this decad. No doubt, the essential nature of the soul, with special emphasis on servanthood (śeṣatva), as the Lord’s vassal, extending upto the Lord’s devotees, was set out, as far back as III-7 ‘Payilum Cuṭaroḷi’. We, however, see in this decad, the Āḻvār intensely longing for the fulfilment of such service, constituting the final goal. Being the liege unto the Lord’s favourite apostles and Saints on Earth is deemd to be a greater virtue, carrying to greater value than direct allegiance to the Lord Himself. In ‘Īṭu’, mention has been made of an anecdote, shedding copious light on this topic.

Ammuṉi Āḻvāṉ, a disciple of Śrī Parāśara Bhaṭṭar was greeted, as follows, by the illustrious master, on the former’s return to Srirangam from his sojourn in the Hoysala country (Mysore):

> “Son, we learn with great pleasure about the service you have
> rendered, during your sojourn in those parts, to the Śrī Vaiṣṇavas,
> over there. In keeping with your spirit of service unto the Lord’s
> devotees, you richly deserve a discourse from me on ‘Netumāṟkaṭimai’,
> the decad of Tiruvāymoḻi, bearing on this very aspect.”

The Āḻvār ends up this decad by praying unto the Lord, that this passionate longing of his to serve the Lord’s devotees should endure till the end of time and it should also be instilled in all those associated with him, generation after generation.

**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நெடுமாற்குஅடிமை செய்வேன்போல் அவனைக் கருத வஞ்சித்து

viṭumāṟueṉpatueṉ? antō! viyaṉ mūvulaku peṟiṉumē?. (2)

**English translation of verse 8.10.1:**

If even the mere thought of simulating service unto the Lord,  
Who for His devotees bears love immense, could truly rid  
Me of all my cruel sins, unknown to me, can this sinner great  
Give up service unto His devotees, at their lovely feet?  
Need I say, except this, I would reject outright all else  
Be it even a gift unto me of all the worlds immense?

**Notes:**

If the mere wish of the Āḻvār, with hardly any semblance of sincerity to serve the Lord, could surely blot out all his deadly sins, that very moment, without his being aware of the whole process how much more beneficial could whole-hearted devotion to His apostles be? This is how the Āḻvār revolved, in his mind, seeing that the Lord bears inordinate love for His devotees and service unto His devotees would, therefore surely please Him much more than direct service unto Him. If the Āḻvār were to choose between service unto the Lord’s devotees on the one hand, and possession of the combined wealth of all the three worlds devolving on him as an unconditional gift on the other, he would not set his eye on the latter but firmly stick to the former; the latter stands no comparison whatever with the former.




## 8.10.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வியன் மூவுலகு பெறினும்போய் தானே தானே ஆனாலும்  
புயல் மேகம்போல் திருமேனிஅம்மான் புனைபூம் கழல்அடிக்கீழ்ச்  
சயமே அடிமை தலைநின்றார் திருத்தாள் வணங்கி இம்மையே

cayamē aṭimai talainiṉṟār tiruttāḷ vaṇaṅki immaiyē  
payaṉē iṉpam yāṉpeṟṟatu uṟumō pāviyēṉukkē?

**English translation of verse 8.10.2:**

Neither sovereignty over the sprawling worlds three  
Nor enjoyment of one’s self, freed from bondage, can equal the bliss,  
This sinner has attained, of adoring the feet lovely  
Of the self-less devotees in the vanguard of service  
Unto the cloud-hued Lord bedecked with lovely flowers and anklet victorious.

**Notes:**

\(i\) Even the combined gift of vast wealth and the ‘Kaivalya’ state of perennial freedom from bodily ties, cannot equalise the bliss of service at the holy feet of the self-less apostles of the Lord, His hot favourites.

\(ii\) The self-enjoyment, referred to, in the second line, is the ‘Kaivalya’ state, denoted by the phrase in the first line of the original text of this song, “self becoming self”. The self in family bondage, cannot enjoy itself, having to be in the midst of the family members, sharing their weal and woe. If it attained Heaven and partook of the bliss of eternal service unto the Lord, it has to be in the company of the glorious attendants over there and once again, there is no scope for solitary enjoyment of one’s own self. And so, the phrase in question could denote only the ‘Kaivalya’ experience or enjoyment of itself by the emancipated soul, in disembodied state. Although this is an eternal state, the Āḻvār would not regard it as the ultimate value (Puruṣārta) worth coveting, rather, he shuns it all along.




## 8.10.3
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

உறுமோ பாவியேனுக்கு இவ்உலகம் மூன்றும் உடன்நிறைய  
சிறுமாமேனி நிமிர்த்த என்செந்தாமரைக்கண் திருக்குறளன்  
நறுமாவிரைநாள் மலர்அடிக்கீழ்ப் புகுதல் அன்றி அவன்அடியார்  
சிறுமா மனிசராய் என்னைஆண்டார் இங்கே திரியவே.

naṟumāviraināḷ malaraṭikkīḻp pukutal aṉṟi avaṉaṭiyār  
ciṟumā maṉicarāy eṉṉaiāṇṭār iṅkē tiriyavē.

**English translation of verse 8.10.3:**

Would it be appropriate if I did attain  
The lotus feet, of fragrance sweet, of the lotus-eyed Lord,  
Who did His midget form expand and pervade  
The worlds three, all at once, seeing that there remain  
In this abode, His devotees great, the ‘*little-big*’ men,  
Who did redeem me, and my mind I can’t turn  
On anything but unremitting service unto them?

**Notes:**

\(i\) Having abjured wealth and ‘Kaivalya Mokṣa’ in the two preceding songs, the Āḻvār now asserts that even service unto the Supreme Lord has to be given the go-by, overwhelmed, as he is, by service unto the ‘*little-big*’ men (as in the original text), over here, which is virtually an enlargement of service unto God. The ‘little-big men’, an apparent contradiction in terms, refers to the great apostles of profound knowledge but with frail bodies, who move about, in this harrowing world, and propagate the gospel of God-love. Here is an interesting anecdote, in elucidation of this extraordinary phrase. When Kūratāḻvāṉ was reciting this stanza within the hearing of his son Parāśara Bhaṭṭar, the latter, a mere boy, was curious to know how the diametrically opposite qualities of littleness and bigness could inhere in one and the same individual. When the young lad sought of his erudite father, clarification in this regard, the latter appreciated the query but expressed his inability to illustrate the position in the light of the Vedic truths, which could not be inculcated in the boy, at that stage, when he had not yet had the spiritual initiation through ‘upanayana’, the sacred investiture ceremony. The learned father, however, found it handy to bring home to the boy the import of the expression in question through concrete examples of the great devotees, profound scholars like Ciriyāccāṉ, Mutaliyāṇṭāṉ, Empār Aruḷāḷapperumāḷ Emperumāṉār etc., possessing frail bodies.

\(ii\) It might be recalled that the Āḻvār was earlier under the irresistible spell cast by the enthralling beauty of Lord Vāmanā but now he switches on to the service of the devotees subjugated by Vāmana’s exquisite charm.




## 8.10.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

இங்கே திரிந்தேற்கு இழுக்குஉற்றுஎன்! இருமாநிலம் முன்உண்டுஉமிழ்ந்த  
செங்கோலத்த பவளவாய்ச் செந்தாமரைக்கண் என்அம்மான்  
பொங்குஏழ் புகழ்கள் வாயவாய் புலன்கொள் வடிவு என்மனத்ததாய்

aṅkuēy malarkaḷ kaiyavāy vaḻipaṭṭuōṭa aruḷilē?

**English translation of verse 8.10.4:**

What would be wrong indeed, if I abjured heaven  
And stayed on, in this abode, my tongue spelt out  
The radiant glory of the lotus-eyed Lord with lovely lips, who gulped down  
All the worlds once and then spat them out,  
I did in my heart implant His form exquisite  
And my hands worshipped Him with choice flowers,  
In the foot-steps of His devotees of great fervour?

**Notes:**

It is but meet that the ‘carama parva niṣṭā’, that is, one who adores the Lord’s devotees much to the delight of the Lord, should adore Him also for the gratification of the devotees. Matura Kavi Āḻvār, who knew no God other than Parāṅkuśa (Nammāḻvār), said, in the third stanza of ‘Kaṇṇiṇuṇ Ciṟuttāmpu,’, that there was nothing wrong in his adoring the cloud-hued Lord, for the delectation of Nammāḻvār, His staunch devotee. That song of his would appear to have been inspired only by this song of his master. The Āḻvār’s tongue, which should sing the glory of the Lord’s devotees, now sings His praise; his mind, where the devotees are to be enshrined, now holds the Lord and his hands which should offer flowers at the feet of the great apostles of the Lord, now place those flowers at His lovely feet. This does not, however, constitute any deviation from his arrowed stance of being the vassal of His devotees (Bhāgavata śeṣatva). Verily, it. is but an extension of that, directed towards the pleasure of those devotees themselves, c.f. Śatrugna’s devotion to Śrī Rāma, as but a corollary to the former’s devotion to Bharata, by-on-means detracting from it. See also the elucidation in aphorism 127 of ‘Acārya Hṛdayam’.




## 8.10.5
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வழிபட்டுஓட அருள்பெற்று மாயன் கோல மலர்அடிக்கீழ்ச்  
சுழிபட்டுஓடும் சுடர்ச்சோதி வெள்ளத்து இன்புற்றுஇருந்தாலும்

moḻipaṭṭuōṭum kaviamutam nukarcci uṟumō muḻutumē?

**English translation of verse 8.10.5:**

Were I blest by the wondrous Lord to render service eternal  
At His lotus feet lovely, in the yonder land supernal,  
With its whirling splendour in spate and rejoice, would it at all equal  
The rapturous rapport with the devout,  
Singing in their holy company, the songs nectarean that sprout.  
From the sweet contemplation of the Lord’s qualities great,  
Albeit possession of the meanest of bodies is my lot?

**Notes:**

The Āḻvār is gradually working up the unique bliss of service unto the Lord’s apostles and Saints and holding a rapport with them, before which even the bliss of eternal service in the yonder Heaven, resplendent with the stream of whirling radiance at the lotus feet of the Lord of transcendent glory, pales into insignificance. In the earlier songs, possession of the wealth of all the three worlds and self-enjoyment in a disembodied state after final emancipation from bodily bondage, have been discarded as insignificant nothing, in comparison with the glory of service unto the Lord’s devotees. The Āḻvār does not mind acquiring the meanest of bodies if that would not hamper the joy of his experiencing the Lord’s glory and transmitting it in the form of sweet songs to be sung in the company of the holy men over here. Feeding the devotees with such songs, providing real nourishment to them, is an important facet of service unṭo the devotees. It is, therefore, very appropriate that this aspect finds mention in this decad.




## 8.10.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நுகர்ச்சி உறுமோ மூவுலகின் வீடு பேறு தன்கேழ்இல்  
புகர்ச்செம்முகத்த களிறுஅட்ட பொன்ஆழிக்கை என்அம்மான்  
நிகர்ச் செம்பங்கி எரிவிழிகள் நீண்ட அசுரர் உயிர்எல்லாம்

takarttuuṇṭuuḻalum puḷpākaṉ periya taṉimāp pukaḻē?

**English translation of verse 8.10.6:**

Will the prowess great, astounding cosmic wealth and sovereignty  
Of the Lord, my Sire, sporting the ring lovely  
And flying (Garuḍa) the bird, smart and lively,  
Who slew the majestic elephant peerless, red with rage,  
And did the red-haired Asuras hefty, with fiery eyes, flay,  
Stand any comparison with the supreme bliss  
Of contemplation of the vast array of His attributes peerless?

**Notes:**

This song is but a follow-up of the immediately preceding song, amplifying the idea conveyed therein. The bliss of contemplation of the Lord’s peerless glory, finding expression through such scintillating hymns, is indeed an experience so great that, before it, even the Lord’s own happiness resulting from His Sovereignty and might, cosmic wealth etc., pales into insignificance.




## 8.10.7
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

தனிமாப் புகழே எஞ்ஞான்றும் நிற்கும் படியாத் தான்தோன்றி  
முனிமாப் பிரம முதல்வித்தாய் உலகம் மூன்றும் முளைப்பித்த  
தனிமாத் தெய்வத் தளிர்அடிக்கீழ்ப் புகுதல் அன்றி அவன்அடியார்

taṉimāt teyvat taḷiraṭikkīḻp pukutal aṉṟi avaṉaṭiyār  
naṉimāk kalavi iṉpamē nāḷum vāykka naṅkaṭkē

**English translation of verse 8.10.7:**

May we the supreme bliss of communion enjoy, for ever,  
With the devout, setting aside even the rapport with the Lord Supreme,  
Of peerless glory, the first cause of one and all, Who did usher  
By a mere resolve, all the worlds of incomparable fame,  
That shall, true to vedic dictum, endure the test of time!

**Notes:**

\(i\) Here is a case of the Āḻvār wanting to reach the farthest limit of God-enjoyment, culminating in rapturous rapport with His devotees (these virtually taking the place of God) and abiding in it, for all time.

\(ii\) The Lord’s peerless glory referred to here, is His extraordinary grace in thinking of resuscitation of the Universe, lying dormant in a subtle state, without distinction of name and form and putting it back on its feet,. Himself being the triple cause (material, operative and instrumental) for such an evolution. The chief merit of this creation is the opportunity it provides unto the creatures to exhibit their gratitude unto their Creator, the great Benefactor, by seeking His lotus feet, as their sole refuge. In the present context, the Āḻvār’s ultimate goal, however, extends up to the devout who thus seek refuge at the Lord’s lovely feet and it is the incessant communion with these Vaiṣṇavas (Lord’s ardent devotees) that the Āḻvār avidly longs for.




## 8.10.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நாளும் வாய்க்க நங்கட்கு நளிர்நீர்க் கடலைப் படைத்து தன்  
தாளும் தோளும் முடிகளும் சமன் இலாத பலபரப்பி  
நீளும் படர்பூங் கற்பகக்காவும் நிறைபல்நாயிற்றின்

**English translation of verse 8.10.8:**

May we for ever behold the assembly grand, of the apostles great,  
Of the Lord, who lay on the cool oceanic waters He did create,  
With outstretched feet, shoulders and crowns, many and matchless,  
Like unto an emerald mount, abounding in crawling orchids  
And gardens fine, beaming with the radiance of Suns in myriads.

**Notes:**

Nothing more is needed, the Āḻvār now says, than even the mere sight of the grand congregation of the Lord’s self-less devotees, steeped in the enjoyment of His enchanting Form, as described herein. Creating, first of all, the vast expanse of water, the Lord lay on it with perfect ease, stretching out His numerous feet, shoulders and crowns, like unto an emerald mount abounding in lovely orchards in repose.




## 8.10.9
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

தமர்கள் கூட்ட வல்வினையை நாசம் செய்யும் சதுமூர்த்தி

**English translation of verse 8.10.9:**

May this vassal, left alone amidst the worldlings, be blest  
With the bliss of service unto the vassal, who stands last  
In the grand chain of the blemishless devotees of the Lord,  
Who did unto Manmata, perennial youth and exquisite charm impart,  
Who the militant weapons, conch, discus, sword, bow etcetera does wield  
And, with His might unique, rids the enemies tough of His holy band.

**Notes**

\(i\) The Lord destroys *en masse* the entire band of those tough enemies of His devotees. It could also mean destruction of the obstacles confronting the band of devotees as a group or the destruction of the cluster of evils, as and when they crop up.

\(ii\) Even the proverbial youth and handsomeness of Manmata, the deity reputed to be a paragon of beauty, are imparted unto him by the Lord, who is ‘Manmata Manmata’.

\(iii\) Three types of devotees have been mentioned in stanzas 2, 9 and 10 of this decad. In the category of those *exemplary devotees to whom service of the Lord is an end in itself*, alluded to in the 2nd stanza, falls Bharata; in the category of *blemishless devotees who are absolutely selfless*, mentioned in this song, is included Śatrughna, while, in the next category of the *inseparable devotees* who can’t brook separation from the Lord, Lakṣmaṇa is right in the vanguard. Likewise, he, Āḻvār and his associates stand on a pedestal of their own, well apart from the mad pursuits of the worldlings.




## 8.10.10
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

**English translation of verse 8.10.10:**

Those that stand last in the chain of the devotees inseparable,  
Of the Lord of the lovely tint of lily blue, with shoulders four,  
Who wields the discus bright, are unto me, my Masters sure;  
May the desire keen to serve them wholly and for ever,  
On me devolve and pass on to my clan, as a whole.

**Note**

The Āḻvār is very keen that such an ardent desire to serve the one that stands last in the long chain of the Lord’s ardent devotees, should not stop with him alone but trickle down to those connected with him, generation after generation. The inseparable devotees, referred to, are those like Lakṣmaṇa, who longed to serve Lord Rāma, day and night, without respite, in all possible ways. (See also notes under VIII-10-9).




## 8.10.11

**English translation of verse 8.10.11:**

Those that are well-versed in these songs ten,  
Out of the thousand uttered by Kurukūr Caṭakōpaṉ,  
Adoring the Lord with lotus eyes, large and lovely, who pervades  
All the three worlds with wholesome creeds,  
Will as householders flourish, with fervour great,  
To serve unremittingly the Lord’s devotees aright.

**Notes**

\(i\) The Āḻvār invests all the three worlds with his remarkable fervour to serve the Lord’s devotees, which has become,as it were, a creed with him. This is the wholesome creed with which he invests all the worlds also. As Śrī Nampiḷḷai puts it, the worlds settled down to orderly thinking, good conduct and behaviour, only after the Āḻvār sang this decad (Tiruvāymoḻi).

\(ii\) Far from getting vexed with the Āḻvār for his by-passing Him and getting into the domain of ‘Bhāgavata-śeṣatva’ (Service to His devotees), the Lord gazes at him in great wonderment, seeing that he pines for this creed of his to trickle down to his futur generations also. In the process, the Lord’s eyes get widened further still, making them even more attractive than before and inviting the Āḻvār to take due note of it and give expression thereto in this end-song.

\(iii\) The benefit accruing to the chanters of this decad, as set out in this end-song, sounds rather queer. To get consigned to the life of a house-holder would seem like getting into some thing the Āḻvār has been abhorring all along, and detests in the very next decad (IX-I). The point to be emphasised here is, however, the merit attaching to ‘Gṛhastāśrama’, life as a virtuous householder, ably supported by members having the common objective of serving the devout with unremitting zeal and sincerity, such as that of Kūrathāḻvāṉ, Aṉaṉtāḻvaṉ and other savants. It is only family life which does not conform to this ideal, that needs to be condemned and eschewed. In ‘Īṭu’ there is, as usual, a juicy anecdote to reinforce the wholesome aspect of family life. The great Ācārya, Śrī Rāmānuja, set out on a pilgrimage to ‘Aṉaṉtacayaṉam’ (Trivandrum in Kerala State), accompanied by a large number of disciples. On the way, they halted at the residence of Celva Nampi, an ardent devotee of remarkable excellence, (vide also the 11th stanza of Periyāḻvār’s Tiruppallāṇṭu) at Tirukkoṭṭiyūr. Although Nampi was out of station, at that time, his equally devoted wife lavishly entertained Śrī Rāmānuja and his huge entourage, overjoyed at the voluntary arrival of so many ‘Bhāgavatas’ (devotees), all at once, an act of grace galore on their part. The household granary which was full of paddy, recently harvested, was pounded into rice, *in toto*, with great jubilation and all that rice was consumed by the venerable guests. On Celva Nampi’s return home, he found the granary absolutely empty. Without the slightest disquietude, the perfect hostess, his wife was, she asssured Nampi that their granary in Heaven should indeed be full. Let it be noted that this is the kind of household that has been vouchsafed by the benign Āḻvār to the chanters of this decad.

Toṇṭaṉūr Nampi, Eccān and a few other great savarts are also said to have dedicated their lives to the service of the devout (Bhāgavatas).




## Retrospective Summary
(8-1): In the concluding decad of the Seventh Centum, we saw how the Āḻvār was longing for the immense pleasure of singing these hymns (Tiruvāymoḻi) before the Divine Couple at Tiruvāraṉviḷai and rendering unto Them, other kinds of service, as well. But then, the project did not get off the ground and non-fulfilment of his cherished desire made the Āḻvār grow sceptical of the Lord’s *bona fides and attributes*, mainly. His traits of loving condescension and ability to concede the wishes of His devotees. And so, we see him giving expression to his misgivings, *in the opening decad of this Centum*. Apprehending, however, that the Āḻvār, sunk in despair, under the delusion that all His auspicious traits have dried up, might collapse altogether, the Lord set at naught his doubts by calling upon him to ponder over all that He had done for him, so far and assuring him of the due fulfilment of whatever He intended to do further for him. Thus consoled, the Āḻvār feels elevated from his erstwhile depression;

(8-2): Although the Āḻvār’s misgivings were cleared up, in the last decad, he was still not happy because of his inability to achieve the external perception of the Lord’s exquisite charm and physical contact, ṭonged for, by him. This gave rise to yet another doubt in his mind, whether the Omniscient Lord still discovered in him traces of worldly desires and was, therefore, holding back. And so, the Āḻvār vindicates, *in the second decad*, his absolute detachment from all things ungodly, fiercely concentrating on the Lord, with no other thought crossing his mind. But then, he does this, not by means of a direct dialogue with the Lord but through argumentation between him, turned as Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī and the mates and elders;

(8-3): The Āḻvār could not lift his mind off the vision of the Lord’s exquisite Form of spectacular grandeur, conjured up by him in VIII-2-10 and, therefore, he voices forth *in the third decad* his apprehension of the safety of the Lord who moves about, in all His heavenly splendour, alone and unaided in this wicked world, peopled by the ungodly and the selfish. In the exuberance of his God-love, the Āḻvār loses perspective of the sequence of time; he would like to move about as the Lord’s camp-follower, carrying His bows and arrows; he is anxious that the turbulent child, who slept in the cradle under Yaśodhā’s nose and is now reposing, as a tender Babe, containing all the worlds in His stomach, on a tender fig-leaf, over the vast expanse of water, with none to attend on Him, should not fall asleep and slip down, into the deep waters; seeing the Lord, in His Iconic manifestation, in a reclining posture in quite a few pilgrim Centres, the Āḻvār thinks that He is relaxing Himself after His strenuous endeavours, such as spanning all the worlds, setting His tender feet over hill and dale, rubbles and brambles etc, and offers to massage His shoulders and feet. Above all, he feels vexed, with his loneliness, not finding yet another, in the whole world, sharing his anxiety in this regard. Towards the end of the decad, we find that the Lord has set the Āḻvār at ease, by convincing him that there was hardly any room for such fears and made him regain his composure, cured of his erstwhile fears;

(8-4): Apprehending that the Āḻvār might, in the exuberance of his God-love, once again entertain fears similar to those voiced forth by him, in the third decad, the Lord wanted to dispel the Āḻvār’s fears, with no chance whatever of their revival. He, therefore, revealed to the Āḻvār, His invulnerable abode in Tirucceṅkuṉṟūr Tirucciṟṟāṟu (Kerala State), out of bounds to the ungodly, attended by the mighty band of three thousand Vedic scholars, full of devotion. As a further precaution, the Lord also exhibited to the Alvār, His wondrous deeds, revealing His extra-ordinary prowess and valour. With his fears thus totally eradicated, the Āḻvār could whole-heartedly enjoy *in the fourth decad* the Lord’s exquisite beauty;

(8-5): The intense mental enjoyment of the Lord’s regal Form, enchanting, every inch, resorted to, by the Āḻvār, in the seventh song of the fourth decad, once again resulted in a deep yearning, an insatiable longing for external perception of the Lord’s Form, as envisioned by him and getting locked in His sweet embrace. Non-fulfilment of his longing has consigned the Āḻvār to the bottom-most depths of dejection, the like of which has not been witnessed, in the earlier decads. He cried out his misery, *in the fifth decad*, like unto one bodily trapped in a forest fire and his limbs appear to be even more worn out than their owner. The Saint beckons the Lord to appear before him, in all His splendour, wearing His crown, tall and majestic and moving along, like the exhilarating rain-cloud, the rising Sun, so on and so forth. The Lord did not, however, respond and so, this decad ends on a despondent note, the Āḻvār being led to believe that he would pass away, immured in grief;

(8-6): Stung by a deep sense of remorse over His laxity in not responding to the Āḻvār’s invitation, the Lord pondered over the steps to be taken by Him to placate the Āḻvār. But then, if He straightaway presented Himself before the Āḻvār, in his present state of mind, he would just collapse due to excessive joy. It was, therefore, expedient that the Āḻvār’s enjoyment of the Lord should be induced by stages, so as to be stable, without anything untoward happening. The Lord, therefore, stationed Himself in Tirukkaṭittāṉam (a pilgrim centre in Kerala State), so as to enable the Āḻvār to go over there and mingle with Him freely. The Āḻvār, who got scent of it, felt elated over the Lord’s overwhelming love for him and gave vent to his resultant joy *in the sixth decad-*,

(8-7): The Lord’s desire to get at the subject, His coveted belonging, is very much more than that of the Āḻvār to get hold of Him. The Lord, therefore, mingles with the Alvār, with such an inordinate longing that the Āḻvār realises, with a stinging sense of shame, that he had tried to reverse the role, by begging of the Lord for his redemption, overlooking the fact that it was the Lord who was all along the supplicant for the Āḻvār’s love unto Him. It is an exceedingly grateful Āḻvār that acknowledges *in the seventh decad*, with great feeling, the enormous love bestowed by the Lord on the individual soul, as the indefatigable cultivator of God-love, in the latter. The bliss enjoyed by the Āḻvār, in this context, stands on a pedestal of its own and it can even be asserted that there is no comparable decad in the entire hymnal;

(8-8): No doubt, the Āḻvār gave vent to his great jubilation, in the seventh decad and even so, in the eighth song of that decad, he referred to himself as a frail being with whom the great Lord of unlimited prowess has chosen to mingle freely and stay on. The Lord noticed, with great concern, the revival of the earlier tendency of the Āḻvār to shrink back from Him, with a frightful sense of his own pettiness, in contra-distinction to the Lord’s grandeur of unlimited dimensions. Therefore, He wanted to quell the Āḻvār’s notion of the Soul’s pettiness by revealing to him its real grandeur. But then, the soul, like unto a mere fire-fly, may not hold out any appeal to the Āḻvār, profoundly struck by the Lord’s exquisite charm. The Lord, therefore, revealed to the Āḻvār, His charm first, and then, the grandeur of the Āḻvār’s soul, in its relation of liegeship to the Sovereign Lord, as delectable unto Him as His ornaments. And so, *in the eighth decad*, the Āḻvār dwells on the intrinsic beauty of the soul, as the exclusive vassal of the Lord, as revealed by the Lord Himself;

(8-9): Seeing that Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī (Āḻvār) has come off marriageable age, the parents make known to the folks, in the town, their intention to get her married to an eligible bachelor. The Nāyakī is, however, fiercely steeped in the Supreme Lord and, as a matter of fact, she has already had secret contacts with the Lord, enshrined in Kuṭṭanāṭṭu Tiruppuliyūr (Kerala State), of which her parents were not aware. The mate, who enjoys the Nāyakī’s confidence, however, knew about it from her speech and comportment but she was afraid of inviting the wrath of the elders, if she publicised the truth about the Nāyakī. At the same time, she did not want that the elders should go ahead, with their plans and so, as a *via-media*, the mate makes it appear that she has just got to know about the Nāyakī’s affair with the Lord, at the aforesaid pilgrim centre. The mate further impresses upon the elders that, in view of this development, it would no longer be feasible for them to pursue their former plans. This brings to the fore, the Nāyakī’s inalienability from the Lord to whom she stands solely dedicated, as the object of His exclusive enjoyment. Thus the essential nature of the soul, as set out in the eighth decad, gets crystallised still further, *in the ninth decad*.

(This is the last of the three decads, in the entire hymnal, put in the mouth of Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī’s mate, the earlier ones being IV-6 and VI-5).

(8-10): The subject’s exclusive dependence on the Supreme Lord was emphasised in the preceding decad. And now, service unto the Lord’s devotees, the logical culmination of service to the Lord, is dealt with, *in the concluding Centum of this decad*. No doubt, the essential nature of the soul, with special emphasis on the concept of servanthood (Śeṣatva), as the Lord’s vassal, extending up to His devotees, was already set out in III-7 (Payilum Cuṭaroḷi). We, however, see, in this decad, the Āḻvār intensely longing for the fulfilment of such service, constituting the final goal. Being the liege, unto the Lord’s favourite apostles and Saints on Earth, is deemed to be a greater virtue, carrying a greater value than direct allegiance to the Lord Himself.
