## 00 Intro9.6
The Āḻvār’s yearning, in the last decad, was indeed too deep for words. At the same time, it has to be stressed that, if the Jñāni loves God dearly, He loves the Jñāni even more. And so, the Lord’s love for the Āḻvār also defies description. Stung by a deep sense of remorse over His laxity in not responding to the Āḻvār’s invitation, the Lord pondered over the step to be taken by Him to placate the Āḻvār. But then, if He straightaway presented Himself before the Āḻvār, in his present state of mind, he would just collapse, due to excessive joy. It was, therefore, expedient that the Āḻvār’s enjoyment of the Lord should be induced by stages, so as to be stable, without anything untoward happening. This was precisely the reason why Śrī Rāma despatched Hanumān first to meet Bharata and convey to him the news of His return from exile soon. It was only a day later, after availing of Sage Bharadvāja’s hospitality en route, that Rama met Bharata who was meanwhile getting ready to receive the elder, back home from His long exile. Lord Kṛṣṇa likewise adopted the ‘go-slow’ tactics by making a night-halt outside Hastināpur and going to the citadel, only the next day. Meanwhile, news had reached the ardent devotees like Vidhura, of the impending visit of the Lord on His famous errand to Dhṛtarāṣṭra’s court. But for this phased programme, excessive joy due to the sudden arrival of Lord Kṛṣṇa would have upset those devotees and thrown them into a state of mental imbalance. In this particular case, the Lord who wished the Āḻvār to come and mingle with Him freely, stationed Himself at the pilgrim centre, known as Tirukkaṭittāṉam (in Kerala State). The Āḻvār, who got scent of it, felt greatly elated over the Lord’s overwhelming love for him. He gives vent to his resultant joy, in this decad.




## 8.6.1
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

எல்லியும் காலையும் தன்னை நினைந்துஎழ  
நல்ல அருள்கள் நமக்கேதந்து அருள்செய்வான்  
அல்லிஅம் தண்ணம்துழாய் முடிஅப்பன்ஊர்  
செல்வர்கள் வாழும் திருக்கடித் தானமே (2)

elliyum kālaiyum taṉṉai niṉaintueḻa  
nalla aruḷkaḷ namakkētantu aruḷceyvāṉ  
alliam taṇṇamtuḻāy muṭiappaṉūr  
celvarkaḷ vāḻum tirukkaṭit tāṉamē (2)

**English translation of verse 8.6.1:**

Tirukkaṭittāṉam, where reside the devotees rich, is the place  
Where my Lord sporting tulaci garland cool and lovely, on His crown, stays,  
And salves us, shedding on us solely His extra-ordinary grace  
And making us meditate on Him always [day and night].

**Notes:**

\(i\) The Āḻvār is indeed overwhelmed by the Lord’s spontaneous grace. Well, he doesn’t take it on a *quid-pro-quo* basis, that is, he does not look at this influx of the Lord’s extra-ordinary grace, making him meditate on Him day and night, as compensation for the grief he experienced in the last decad, but as one shed on him for the Lord’s own pleasure and exultation, at His sweet will. What more? The Āḻvār feels that the Lord has not shed on any one else, not even the ‘Nityas’ in Heaven, grace of this magnitude. It is indeed most gratifying to the Āḻvār that the Lord presents Himself in Tirukkaṭittāṉam, wearing the tulaci garland, pretty and fragrant, as longed for by him in the third song of the last decad.

\(ii\) *Rich devotees*: The text of the song, as in the original refers to this pilgrim centre, as one inhabited by rich persons. The richness, alluded to here, is, however, not of the material kind but the ‘*Kaiṅkarya Śrī*’ like that of Lakṣmaṇa who served Lord Rāma in all possible ways and was thus extremely rich in divine service. Real affluence lies in eternal service to the Lord.




## 8.6.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

திருக்கடித் தானமும் என்னுடையச் சிந்தையும்  
ஒருக்கடுத்துஉள்ளே உறையும்பிரான் கண்டீர்  
செருக்கடுத்துஅன்று திகைத்த அரக்கரை  
உருக்கெடவாளி பொழிந்த ஒருவனே.

tirukkaṭit tāṉamum eṉṉuṭaiyac cintaiyum  
orukkaṭuttuuḷḷē uṟaiyumpirāṉ kaṇṭīr  
cerukkaṭuttuaṉṟu tikaitta arakkarai  
urukkeṭavāḷi poḻinta oruvaṉē.

**English translation of verse 8.6.2:**

The Lord, who lovingly resides in Tirukkaṭittāṉam and my heart alike,  
Is none but the Warrior great, Who arrows did rain  
On the Asuras, who, filled with pride, had grown  
Violent and war-mad, and destroyed them, in bulk.

**Notes:**

The Āḻvār acknowledges the Lord’s great gesture in quelling the Asuras, symbolic of the clearing up of all the evil forces in him, the impediments that stood in the way of the Lord reclaiming him and thereafter, stepping on to Tirukkaṭittāṉam, the spring-board, whence He was to land right in the Āḻvār’s heart, His ultimate destination. The Lord’s attachment to the Jñāni’s physical form even surpasses His love for the pilgrim centres, where He has condescended to shed His grace on the votaries in His ‘Arca’ Form. This is quite understandable, seeing that the very purpose of His manifestation in ‘Arca’ Form, is only to get hold of His subjects, by some means or the other. And when He gets His catch all right, and a big haul at that, His gratification knows no bounds. The Lord’s stay in the pilgrim centres is thus not an end in itself but only a means for the reclamation of His subjects, His ultimate destination being the heart-centre of the subjects, spiritually regenerated through His redemptive grace. Once the destination is reached, the means employed for reaching it get relegated to a place of secondary importance. It is then the turn of a devotee like Pēy Āḻvār to request the Lord not to relax His interest in the pilgrim centres which operate as the springboard whence the Lord could reach His devotees. It is now a case of the Lord loving the pilgrim centres, firstly, as places adored by His devotees, and secondly, out of gratitude to those centres for helping Him to reclaim the subjects, by making them God-bent (See aphorisms 169-174 of Śrī Vacana Bhūṣaṇam).;




## 8.6.3
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஒருவர் இருவர் ஓர் மூவர்என நின்று  
உருவுகரந்து உள்ளும்தோறும் தித்திப்பான்  
திருஅமர் மார்வன் திருக்கடித்தானத்தை  
மருவிஉறைகின்ற மாயப்பிரானே.

oruvar iruvar ōr mūvareṉa niṉṟu  
uruvukarantu uḷḷumtōṟum tittippāṉ  
tiruamar mārvaṉ tirukkaṭittāṉattai  
maruviuṟaikiṉṟa māyappirāṉē.

**English translation of verse 8.6.3:**

The Warrior Great, Who did arrows on Asuras rain  
Was seen first as one, then as two and three later on,  
And at one time hardly visible; this wondrous Benefactor great,  
Who bears Tiru (Lakṣmī) on His chest, does in Tirukkaṭittāṉam lovingly stay  
And is indeed very sweet to contemplate.

**Notes:**

\(i\) This song does not stand by itself, being but a follow-up of the preceding song. The warrior, referred to, is Śrī Rāma. When Rāvaṇa unleashed his special Reserve forces (Mūlabala [Mūlabalam]), after the valiant Rākṣasas had vanished, one by one, into the jaws of death, the manner in which this extra-ordinary situation, which struck unspeakable terror in the minds of the Devas, was handled by Śrī Rāma, is alluded to here. The battle was as spectacular as it was terrific and Vālmīki was simply thrilled by the uncanny and superhuman effort, displayed by Sri Rama. In śloka 22 of chapter 94 of Yuddha Kāṇḍa, it has been said that Rāma was hardly visible and yet, one could see the enormous extent of destruction wrought by Him. This only reveals the marvellous agility with which He went gyrating around, routing the enemy forces. A little further down, in śloka 27, it has been stated that thousands of Rāmas were seen in action. Again, in the latter half of the same śloka, it has been stated that Rāma alone and none else could be seen on the battlefield. It was indeed a wonderful wonder of wonders the way the Lord encountered the enemies who were not only powerful but also very elusive.

\(ii\) The Lord exhibits even greater love towards the Āḻvār than that bestowed on the Divine Consort, borne on His very chest, the simple reason that he is Her ward. Again, the Lord loves Tirukkaṭittāṉam, only because it is adored by the Āḻvār. This has already been set out, at length, in the notes below the second song. Yet, it is mentioned here, only to reveal the Āḻvār’s immense jubilation, as he meditates on this aspect.




## 8.6.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மாயப்பிரான் எனவல்வினை மாய்ந்துஅற  
நேசத்தினால் நெஞ்சம் நாடு குடிகொண்டான்  
தேசத்துஅமரர் திருக்கடித்தானத்தை  
வாசப்பொழில்மன்னு கோயில்கொண்டானே.

māyappirāṉ eṉavalviṉai māyntuaṟa  
nēcattiṉāl neñcam nāṭu kuṭikoṇṭāṉ  
tēcattuamarar tirukkaṭittāṉattai  
vācappoḻilmaṉṉu kōyilkoṇṭāṉē.

**English translation of verse 8.6.4:**

The wondrous Lord, Who, in Tirukkaṭittāṉam, stands enshrined,  
Abounding in orchards, full of fragrance, the lovely resort  
Of even the Celestials bright, has lovingly sought  
The kingdom of my heart, to get my dire sins ruined.

**Notes:**

Whereas the Lord gives ‘dharśan [darśana]’ to the votaries in the pilgrim centres only during stated hours, mostly by day, He stays for ever, in the heart of the Āḻvār, coveted by Him a great deal. This very thought, coupled with the realisation of the fact that the Lord has chosen to grace Tirukkaṭittāṇam, only to please him, has heightened the Āḻvār’s joy.




## 8.6.5
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கோயில் கொண்டான்தன் திருக்கடித் தானத்தை  
கோயில்கொண்டான் அதனோடும் என்நெஞ்சகம்;  
கோயில்கொள் தெய்வம்எல்லாம் தொழ வைகுந்தம்  
கோயில்கொண்ட குடக்கூத்த அம்மானே.

kōyil koṇṭāṉtaṉ tirukkaṭit tāṉattai  
kōyilkoṇṭāṉ ataṉōṭum eṉneñcakam;  
kōyilkoḷ teyvamellām toḻa vaikuntam  
kōyilkoṇṭa kuṭakkūtta ammāṉē.

**English translation of verse 8.6.5:**

The Lord Who is by the exalted Celestials adored,  
Who has the high Heavens as His abode,  
Who (as Kṛṣṇa) did the wondrous pot-dance perform  
Is the One Who made Tirukkaṭittāṉam His home,  
And has, along with that home, moved now into my heart,  
Making it His new habitat.

**Notes**

\(i\) As already elucidated, Tirukkaṭittāṉam was but the stepping stone, the spring-board whence the Lord could get into the Āḻvār‘s heart. The Lord initially thought of entering the Āḻvār’s heart, all alone, without His retinue and all that. But then, He changed His mind and entered the Alvar’s heart along with that pilgrim centre itself c.f. Periyāḻvār Tirumoḻi V-2-10, where Peryāḻvār says that the Lord resorted unto his body with His entire retinue, the serpent-bed, the Milk-ocean and the Divine Consort and rested on the cool crest of the ocean, to grant him the necessary protection.

\(ii\) The Lord incarnated as Kṛṣṇa, among the cowherds and performed the pot-dance; to get over the resultant fatigue, He released Himself at Tirukkaṭittāṉam and thence shifted to the Āḻvār’s heart, along with that pilgrim centre.




## 8.6.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கூத்தஅம்மான் கொடியேன்இடர் முற்றவும்  
மாய்த்தஅம்மான் மதுசூத அம்மான்உறை  
பூத்தபொழில்தண் திருக்கடித் தானத்தை  
ஏத்தநில்லா குறிக்கொள்மின் இடரே.

kūttaammāṉ koṭiyēṉiṭar muṟṟavum  
māyttaammāṉ matucūta ammāṉuṟai  
pūttapoḻiltaṇ tirukkaṭit tāṉattai  
ēttanillā kuṟikkoḷmiṉ iṭarē.

**English translation of verse 8.6.6:**

Tirukkaṭittāṉam, the holy centre, cool and nice, amid orchards, in full bloom,  
Where resides my Lord of wondrous deeds, Matucūtaṉ, my Sire,  
Who did, in full, destroy the miseries of this sinner dire,  
Will set at naught our miseries, one and all, be sure,  
The moment we adore it, with love supreme.

**Notes:**

Lest the preceding song should give some the impression that the pilgrim centre, known as Tirukkaṭittāṉam, has ceased to exist as such, having entered the Āḻvār’s heart, *en masse* the Āḻvār now calls upon his fellow-beings to worship the holy centre. As already elaborated upon in the notes below the second song of this decad, the pilgrim centres acquire importance, firstly, as places adored by the Lord’s devotees and hence loved by the Lord as well, and secondly, as the centres of attraction helping the Lord to reclaim His subjects, by making them God-bent and hence gratefully loved by the Lord.




## 8.6.7
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கொண்டமின் இடர்கெட உள்ளத்து கோவிந்தன்  
மண்விண் முழுதும் அளந்தஒண்தாமரை  
மண்ணவர் தாம்தொழ வானவர் தாம்வந்து  
நண்ணு திருக்கடித்தான நகரே

koṇṭamiṉ iṭarkeṭa uḷḷattu kōvintaṉ  
maṇviṇ muḻutum aḷantaoṇtāmarai  
maṇṇavar tāmtoḻa vāṉavar tāmvantu  
naṇṇu tirukkaṭittāṉa nakarē

**English translation of verse 8.6.7:**

Set your mind on Tirukkaṭittāṉam, the holy city,  
Where the people of this land worship the lotus feet lovely,  
Of Kōvintaṇ, which, the earth and the regions above, did measure wholly,  
And the denizens of heaven also come down and adore,  
So that all your miseries do instantly disappear.

**Notes:**

\(i\) In the preceding song, the Āḻvār exhorted the worldlings to worship this pilgrim centre but here he says it would suffice if they just think of the place.

\(ii\) Even as Heaven is the land of the Nityas (Eternal Heroes), the pilgrim centres on Earth belong to us, the earthlings, as Nampiḷḷai would put it. It should indeed be a matter of deep wonder to the exalted ‘Nityas’ in Heaven, with profound knowledge, how the Great Lord abides in the midst of the worldlings over here, steeped in dark nescience and is easily accessible to them, an act of grace galore, denoting His amazing simplicity, the very antithesis of Heavenly grandeur and majesty (Paratva or transcendent glory). And so, it is a case of the ‘Nityas’ coming down here to have a taste of His amazing simplicity, even as those over here go up to Heaven to witness and enjoy His transcendent glory.




## 8.6.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

தான நகர்கள் தலைச்சிறந்து எங்கெங்கும்  
வான்இந் நிலம்கடல் முற்றும் எம்மாயற்கே  
ஆனவிடத்தும் என் நெஞ்சும் திருக்கடித்  
தான நகரும் தனதாயப் பதியே.

tāṉa nakarkaḷ talaicciṟantu eṅkeṅkum  
vāṉin nilamkaṭal muṟṟum emmāyaṟkē  
āṉaviṭattum eṉ neñcum tirukkaṭit  
tāṉa nakarum taṉatāyap patiyē.

**English translation of verse 8.6.8:**

This earth, the yonder Heaven, the Milk-ocean and other habitats  
Are, no doubt, elegant and exhilarating, which my Lord befit  
And yet, Tirukkaṭittāṉam, the holy city and my heart  
Are just the ones, the Lord has chosen as His favourite spots.

**Note**

There are innumerable delectable centres here, there (Heaven) and elsewhere, which could regale the Lord. Still, Tirukkaṭittāṉam and the Āḻvār’s heart are the only two regions, which the Lord feels compelled to enjoy and esteem, as devolving on Him as a matter of right.




## 8.6.9
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

தாயப்பதிகள் தலைச்சிறந்து எங்கெங்கும்  
மாயத்தினால் மன்னி வீற்றிருந்தான்உறை  
தேசத்துஅமரர் திருக்கடித்தானத்துள்  
ஆயர்க்குஅதிபதி அற்புதன்தானே.

tāyappatikaḷ talaicciṟantu eṅkeṅkum  
māyattiṉāl maṉṉi vīṟṟiruntāṉuṟai  
tēcattuamarar tirukkaṭittāṉattuḷ  
āyarkkuatipati aṟputaṉtāṉē.

**English translation of verse 8.6.9:**

Tirukkaṭittāṉam, the loving resort of even Celestials bright,  
Is where the wondrous Chief of cowherds (Kaṇṇaṉ) alights,  
With pleasure immense, looking upon it as the best  
Of the pilgrim centres that do all over exist.

**Notes:**

All pilgrim centers, without distinction of big and small are sacred indeed, and yet, the Lord covets Tirukkaṭittāṉam most, being the centre which enabled Him to gain access to the Āḻvār by exhibiting to the latter His grandeur as well as grace galore, His amazing simplicity.




## 8.6.10
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அற்புதன் நாராயணன் அரி வாமனன்  
நிற்பது மேவி இருப்பது என்நெஞ்சகம்  
நல்புகழ் வேதியர் நான்மறை நின்றுஅதிர்  
கற்பகச் சோலைத் திருக்கடித் தானமே. (2)

aṟputaṉ nārāyaṇaṉ ari vāmaṉaṉ  
niṟpatu mēvi iruppatu eṉneñcakam  
nalpukaḻ vētiyar nāṉmaṟai niṉṟuatir  
kaṟpakac cōlait tirukkaṭit tāṉamē. (2)

**English translation of verse 8.6.10:**

’Tis only to stay lovingly in my heart, His ultimate abode,  
Nārāyaṇan, Who is also Ari and Vāmaṉaṉ, the wondrous Lord,  
Stands in Tirukkaṭittāṉam, with lovely orchards,  
Where the celebrated brahmins reside,  
Chanting the Vedas four, for ever and aloud.

**Notes:**

In order to gain access to the Āḻvār, the Lord came down to Tirukkaṭittāṉam and stood there. Once He got on to His destination, the Āḻvār’s heart-centre, He would stay there only all the time.




## 8.6.11
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

சோலைத் திருக்கடித்தானத்து உறைதிரு  
மாலை மதிள்குருகூர்ச் சடகோபன் சொல்  
பாலோடு அமுதுஅன்ன ஆயிரத்து இப்பத்தும்  
மேலை வைகுந்தத்து இருத்தும் வியந்தே. (2)

cōlait tirukkaṭittāṉattu uṟaitiru  
mālai matiḷkurukūrc caṭakōpaṉ col  
pālōṭu amutuaṉṉa āyirattu ippattum  
mēlai vaikuntattu iruttum viyantē. (2)

**English translation of verse 8.6.11:**

These songs ten, out of the thousand delicious songs,  
Gracefully composed by Kurukūr Caṭakōpaṉ, adoring  
The Lord Who resides in Tirukkaṭittāṉam, abounding  
In orchards many, will the chanters thereof elevate  
Unto the exalted Heaven with delight great.

**Notes:**

\(i\) These ten songs will, by themselves, elevate their chanters to the high Heavens, on the ground that the Lord shall not brook separation from them even for a trice. This, of course, means that the Lord will be greatly delighted to hear these songs and, in the exuberance of His joy, instantly lift the chanters up to His heavenly abode.

\(ii\) The songs relate the glory of the great Lord and their author is no less than His most beloved Saint Nam-māḻvār. The text, in the original, says that these songs are delicious like the milk porridge (rice boiled in milk and neatly spiced); the Lord constitutes the milk and the Āḻvār’s songs, the other ingredients, put together—a delightful combination of diction and subject-matter and manner of expression.
