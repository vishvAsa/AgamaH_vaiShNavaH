## 00 Intro3.9
\(1\) Among the myriads of the Lord’s Creatures the human form is a rare gift of the Lord. Even so, the human form, thus dowered, has to be free from physical and mental handicaps. Even then, acquisition of a high degree of learning is rare and rarer still is the capacity for writing Verses. And then again, this extremely rare gift of verse-making has to be put to proper use but, more often than not, this talent is prostituted for the poet’s selfish ends, by indulging in praise of the petty humans, as, for example, the Sanskrit work, entitled ‘Pratāpa Rudrīyam [Rudṛyaṃ]’. The Āḻvār naturally deplores such misguided poets and advises them to give up their low base and elevate themselves to their legitimate stature, as the Lord’s bards, soaring high, singing exclusively His great glory, in beautiful, meTical compositions. The Āḻvār mostly bemoans his separation from the Lord during those moments when communion with Him gets snapped, for one reason or another. But now and then, he turns his attention on the worldlings around, moved by their sad plight. In this decad, he exhorts the poets to harness their literary excellence to useful purpose by singing the many auspicious traits and wondrous deeds of the Lord and not to go the wrong way, eulogising the frail humans.

\(2\) The Āḻvār had addressed the worldlings earlier too, but with little success. In stanza 25 of his ‘Periya Tiruvantāti he exclaimed, in sheer disgust, that it was impossible to correct the worldlings and that he would, therefore, leave them severely alone, free to do whatever they liked. But then, his fellow-feeling asserts itself; his deep compassion for the suffering humanity wallowing in worldly life, was such that he just could not be indifferent to them and abandon them to their fate. That is why he turned his attention on them, now and then, in the midst of his own mystic experiences, alternating between union with and separation from God.

The reasons prompting the Āḻvār to exhort the worldlings are three-fold, namely,

> \(i\) the inter-relationship between Man and God is the same as that
> between God and the denizens of the high heaven and yet, while those
> in heaven partake of that perennial bliss emanating from the Lord, all
> the time, the worldlings are straying away from Him, bogged down in
> the difficult and miserable terrain of worldly life. The fundamental
> relationship between them and God, therefore, needs to be impressed
> upon the worldlings so that they may also be turned towards God;
>
> \(ii\) The Āḻvār’s inability to stand the sight of the suffering
> humanity caught up in the unenviable meshes of worldly life and
>
> \(iii\) The Āḻvār’s tender solicitude for the Earthlings overflows its
> continent and seeks to sustain itself by reclaiming even those given
> up by the Almighty Lord, as ‘Incorrigibles’. (See aphorism 203 of
> Ācārya Hṛdayam).

\(3\) In the realm of God-love, the lovers’ thoughts are always rivetted to Him, their lives are nestled in Him and they sustain themselves through mutual joy and enlightenment derived by talking about His great glory and listening to it by turns. The Āḻvār turns round in search of such enlightened company but he is sadly disappointed. He advises the men around, hoping to bring them round to his way of thinking, but finds that his advice has once again fallen on deaf eats. He, however, ends up this decad on a complacent note, satisfied with his own role as God’s poet, unlike the Earthlings who misuse their poetic talents.




## 3.9.1
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

சொன்னால் விரோதம் இது ஆகிலும் சொல்லுவான் கேண்மினோ,  
என் நாவில் இன்கவி யான் ஒருவர்க்கும் கொடுக்கிலேன்,  
தென்னா தெனா என்று வண்டு முரல் திருவேங்கடத்து,  
என் ஆனை என் அப்பன் எம் பெருமான் உளனாகவே.

coṉṉāl virōtam itu ākilum colluvāṉ kēṇmiṉō,  
eṉ nāvil iṉkavi yāṉ oruvarkkum koṭukkilēṉ,  
teṉṉā teṉā eṉṟu vaṇṭu mural tiruvēṅkaṭattu,  
eṉ āṉai eṉ appaṉ em perumāṉ uḷaṉākavē.

**English translation of verse 3.9.1:**

Listen, Ye, men, let me my mind speak out  
Although it may not by you be liked;  
The songs sweet that from my tongue sprout  
Laud none but my Liege-Lord  
At Tiruvēṅkaṭam, by humming bees swarmed,  
My Benefactor great, majestic like elephant;  
Waste I shan’t on anyone else my poetic talent.

**Notes**

\(i\) The Āḻvār does not straightaway say what he intends to preach, in this decad. He begins by stating his own case, namely, that his tongue shall sing exclusively the glory of the Lord at Tiruvēṅkaṭam. the holy Mount and its fauna and flora. The individual Soul is as good as non-existent, when it does not turn its thoughts on God and sustain itself by singing His glory. But, here is an extraordinary situation, the Lord stationing Himself in near-by Tiruvēṅkaṭan in order to sustain Himself through the songs sung by the Āḻvār. There is, therefore, no question of the Āḻvār turning his attention on any one else and, by saying so, he wants the men of the world to emulate him and follow in his foot-steps.

\(ii\) The Āḻvār is quite aware that calling upon the worldlings to desist from praising the frail humans, the so-called earthly Lords, will not be palatable to these short-sighted folks, as that would mean depriving them of the odds and ends, the petty favours they may otherwise obtain. Nevertheless, he advises them, unable to stand the sight of their suffering, like unto the advice tendered by

\(i\) Sītā, the Divine Mother to the demoniac Rāvaṇa, (ii) Prahlāda unto Hiraṇya and the fellow—pupils and (iii) Vibhīṣaṇa unto a terribly hostile Rāvaṇa.




## 3.9.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

உளனாகவே எண்ணி தன்னை ஒன்றாக தன் செல்வத்தை  
வளனா மதிக்கும் இம் மானிடத்தைக் கவி பாடி என்,  
குளன் ஆர் கழனிசூழ் கண்ணன் குறுங்குடி மெய்ம்மையே,  
உளனாய எந்தையை எந்தை பெம்மானை ஒழியவே?

uḷaṉākavē eṇṇi taṉṉai oṉṟāka taṉ celvattai  
vaḷaṉā matikkum im māṉiṭattaik kavi pāṭi eṉ,  
kuḷaṉ ār kaḻaṉicūḻ kaṇṇaṉ kuṟuṅkuṭi meymmaiyē,  
uḷaṉāya entaiyai entai pemmāṉai oḻiyavē?

**English translation of verse 3.9.2:**

What use is there in composing hymns  
In praise of these frail humans  
Who think no end of themselves and their wealth ephemeral.  
Without lauding my benefactor great, the Lord eternal,  
Truly abiding in Kuṟuṅkuṭi, with many a pond and fields fertile?

**Notes**

\(i\) The Lord’s wealth and His auspicious traits are unlimited, in dire contrast to the petty wealth possessed, for a short while, by the mortals who still think no end of themselves and their so-called possessions. It provokes the righteous indignation of the Āḻvār when he finds people running after the petty men and their equally petty wealth, as good as non-existent, without turning their minds on God (near at hand, full of auspicious traits) and singing His glory.

\(ii\) (*a*) *What to do*: The Lord Who stays in Heaven in His transcendental Form, Who reclines on the milkocean in His ‘Vyūha’ aspect, Who incarnated as Śrī Rāma, Kṛṣṇa and so on, who resides in His Iconic Form in Pilgrim centres like Kuṟuṅkuṭi, is alone praiseworthy and, therefore, the few of us gifted with poetic talents should compose hymns singing the Lord’s glory, His countless auspicious traits and wcndṛous deeds, cosmic wealth of unlimited dimensions etc.

(*b) What not to do*: Don’t debase your poetic talent by composing poems glorifying the insignificant humans, importing merits where there is none and overlooking all their faults although they are too numerous to be ignored. Here is an interesting anecdote: A wealthy man, named, Cōḷa Brahmarāya, wrote out a commentary on ‘Tiruvāymoḻi’ and gave it to Nañcīyar for perusal and writing out the Foreword. The Saint did not, however, like to get involved in this, lest he should have to point out the mistakes and incur the displeasure of the glossator. He, therefore, passed it on to his disciple, Nampiḷḷai, who discreetly gave it back to the author after some time, complimenting him, more as a matter of formality, on his close adherence to Saint Nammāḻvār’s philosophy. Thereupon, Cōḷa Brahmarāya felt unduly elated and went even to the extent of rating himself above Nammāḻvār on the ground that, with his superior talents, he was able to write out the commentary in the midst of the multifarious duties his high position demanded of him, while Nammāḻvār had nothing else to do when he composed ‘Tiruvāymoḻi’. This brings to the fore the vanity of people who easily lose their heads, the more so, when they are surrounded by sycophants indulging in fulsome flattery.

\(iii\) ‘*Kuṟuṅkuṭi*’, a pilgrim centre, in the deep south in Tamil Nadu, is also known as ‘Vaiṣṇava Vāmana Kṣetra’. It was due to the grace of the Lord enshrined here that Nammāḻvār was born.




## 3.9.3
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஒழிவு ஒன்று இல்லாத பல் ஊழிதோறு ஊழி நிலாவப், போம்  
வழியைத் தரும் நங்கள் வானவர் ஈசனை நிற்கப் போய்,  
கழிய மிக நல்லவான் கவி கொண்டு புலவீர்காள்,  
இழியக் கருதி ஓர் மானிடம் பாடல் என் ஆவதே.

oḻivu oṉṟu illāta pal ūḻitōṟu ūḻi nilāvap, pōm  
vaḻiyait tarum naṅkaḷ vāṉavar īcaṉai niṟkap pōy,  
kaḻiya mika nallavāṉ kavi koṇṭu pulavīrkāḷ,  
iḻiyak karuti ōr māṉiṭam pāṭal eṉ āvatē.

**English translation of verse 3.9.3:**

Ye, men of learning, What do you gain at all  
By lauding the petty humans thro’ songs superfine,  
Shutting your eyes to the glory of the Overlord of Celestials,  
Who shall unto you vouchsafe everlasting service divine?

**Notes**

\(i\) In his address to the poets of the world, the Āḻvār appeals to their good sense and discriminative faculty, to discern for themselves that the Supreme Lord, served and adored by the whole lot of them in the high heavens, the repository of innumerable auspicious qualities, is alone praiseworthy and one can praise Him till the end of time and still cannot exhaust His glory. And to these who adore Him He vouchsafes the eternal bliss of serving Him. Again poetry comes into its own only when it lauds His glory and not when it is profaned by making it the medium for eulogising the worthless humans.

\(ii\) And now, look at the other picture, dark and dismal. The so-called big men of the Earth these poets run after, get scent of the latter’s approach and run away from them for fear of having to bestow gifts. And then, the poets overshoot the mark and make even people very much amenable to flattery suspect that they ate either being fooled or the cap does not fit them. In this absurd chase for illusory gains, petty and ephemeral, the poets, far from edifying themselves, descend to the bottom-most depths of depravity, just the opposite of what they intend to achieve, all because they have chosen the wrong theme for their poems notwithstanding their literary excellence.




## 3.9.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

என் ஆவது எத்தனை நாளைக்குப் போதும் புலவீர்காள்,  
மன்னா மனிசரைப் பாடிப் படைக்கும் பெரும் பொருள்?,  
மின் ஆர் மணிமுடி விண்ணவர் தாதையைப் பாடினால்,  
தன்னாகவே கொண்டு சன்மம் செய்யாமையும் கொள்ளுமே.

eṉ āvatu ettaṉai nāḷaikkup pōtum pulavīrkāḷ,  
maṉṉā maṉicaraip pāṭip paṭaikkum perum poruḷ?,  
miṉ ār maṇimuṭi viṇṇavar tātaiyaip pāṭiṉāl,  
taṉṉākavē koṇṭu caṉmam ceyyāmaiyum koḷḷumē.

**English translation of verse 3.9.4:**

Ye, poets, how long can the wealth immense you obtain,  
By singing the praise of the mortals sustain  
You all? better sing the glory of the Lord Supreme,  
Wearing the crown resplendent set with gems,  
The Devas’ Sovereign; He will take you unto His fold,  
Besides, you will from further births be freed.

**Note**

To the question put by the Āḻvār what the Earthly poets would gain by praising the petty humans, the poets say that their patrons do give them gifts, in appreciation of their composition. The Āḻvār, however, questions them again and asks them how long the wealth, they so obtain, will last. As a matter of fact, it takes the scholar quite some time to write out a book or compose a poem in adoration of these mortals and just when he sets out to meet the prospective donor, the shocking news comes of the latter having passed away. Even otherwise, the poets themselves do not live to enjoy the fruits of their labour and if they live long the gifts bestowed on them by the earthly patrons do not last long. Is it not therefore clear that the scholars should shift their base and concentrate on the glory of the Lord of the ‘Nityā Sūris’ (Eternal Heroes) in Heaven? The Lord, the one and only Giver, there being no gift beyond Him. will bestow on the hymnographers the choicest gift of eternal service unto Him and cut out the material body to sustain which they went about praising the frail mortals. The Lord has the unique reputation of elevating the subjects on a par with Him—the great giver with no restraint!




## 3.9.5
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கொள்ளும் பயன் இல்லை குப்பை கிளர்த்தன்ன செல்வத்தை,  
வள்ளல் புகழ்ந்து நும் வாய்மை இழக்கும் புலவீர்காள்,  
கொள்ளக் குறைவு இலன் வேண்டிற்று எல்லாம் தரும் கோது இல், என்  
வள்ளல் மணிவண்ணன் தன்னைக் கவி சொல்ல வம்மினோ.

koḷḷum payaṉ illai kuppai kiḷarttaṉṉa celvattai,  
vaḷḷal pukaḻntu num vāymai iḻakkum pulavīrkāḷ,  
koḷḷak kuṟaivu ilaṉ vēṇṭiṟṟu ellām tarum kōtu il, eṉ  
vaḷḷal maṇivaṇṇaṉ taṉṉaik kavi colla vammiṉō.

**English translation of verse 3.9.5:**

Ye. scholars, that do your tongue defile  
In eulogy of the fellow-beings frail  
Whose wealth is little better than a mound of filth!  
Come and compose songs lauding the one, fully worth  
All the praise you bestow on Him,  
My Lord flawless, like unto blue gem,  
The benefactor great, the donor supreme.

**Notes**

\(i\) It is indeed, a deplorable exercise in futility to compose songs glorifying the fellow-beings who, far from being praise-worthy, will only have their many drawbacks exposed in the process, like unto the scrutiny of the contents of the dust-bin. Apart from not getting anything tangible and everlasting, from their mis-directed efforts, the poets lose their veracity by indulging in fulsome flattery. Thus, while there is no positive gain, there is indeed a positive loss.

\(ii\) *Flawless*: The Lord whose wealth is unlimited, is a flawless Giver, giving in plenty, without expecting anything in return. In His gifts there is no constraint; they are not merely abundant but exuberant.




## 3.9.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வம்மின் புலவீர்! நும் மெய் வருத்திக் கைசெய்து உய்ம்மினோ,  
இம் மன் உலகினில் செல்வர் இப்போது இல்லை நோக்கினோம்,  
நும் இன் கவி கொண்டு நும் நும் இட்டா தெய்வம் ஏத்தினால்,  
செம் மின் சுடர் முடி என் திருமாலுக்குச் சேருமே.

vammiṉ pulavīr! num mey varuttik kaiceytu uymmiṉō,  
im maṉ ulakiṉil celvar ippōtu illai nōkkiṉōm,  
num iṉ kavi koṇṭu num num iṭṭā teyvam ēttiṉāl,  
cem miṉ cuṭar muṭi eṉ tirumālukkuc cērumē.

**English translation of verse 3.9.6:**

Come, ye, potts, give up eulogising the humans,  
There’s none in this land big, as I now examine,  
Wealthy enough to reward you well for your hymns;  
‘Tis but meet, you shall, by the sweat of your brow, earn;  
If you praise the deity of your heart, even then,  
Those promises shall reach my Tirumāl, with lustrous crown.

**Notes**

\(i\) *Come, Ye, poets*: The Āḻvār beckons the poets in the same way as a person invites persons caught up in a forest fire to come and have a dip in a pond full of water, cool and deep. The poets, however, submit that they have

to eke out their livelihood by lauding the humans. The Āḻvār emphasises that they should not debase their talents and they might as well earn by physical labour. But then, the poets, not accustomed to bodily exertion, make out that composing poems was the easier of the two and that they should, therefore, be allowed to pursue their normal avocation. The Āḻvār does not, however, mince matters and tightly points out that there is none in this world wealthy enough to reward their talents suitably and that they should not undetsell themselves.

\(ii\) *If you praise the Deity of your heart*: If you say that even if there be no wealthy person among the humans, Indra and other Devas could be considered wealthy and you would, therefore, compose poems singing their glory, well, whatever praise you heap on them will actually reach ‘Tirumāl’ (Lord Viṣṇu), as their Internal Controller, rather, it will be more appropriate to Him, being the one really praiseworthy. And, therefore, you had better praise the Supreme Lord, straightaway, instead of passing through intermediaries.




## 3.9.7
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

சேரும் கொடை புகழ் எல்லை இலானை, ஓர் ஆயிரம்  
பேரும் உடைய பிரானை அல்லால் மற்று யான் கிலேன்,  
மாரி அனைய கை மால் வரை ஒக்கும் திண் தோள் என்று,  
பாரில் ஓர் பற்றையைப் பச்சைப் பசும் பொய்கள் பேசவே.

cērum koṭai pukaḻ ellai ilāṉai, ōr āyiram  
pērum uṭaiya pirāṉai allāl maṟṟu yāṉ kilēṉ,  
māri aṉaiya kai māl varai okkum tiṇ tōḷ eṉṟu,  
pāril ōr paṟṟaiyaip paccaip pacum poykaḷ pēcavē.

**English translation of verse 3.9.7:**

Utter I Can’t damned white lies that project  
The duds on Earth as the cloud munificent  
And glorify their shoulders as mountains great;  
Praise I can only my gracious Lord of glory unlimited,  
Bearing a thousand names, my benefactor great.

**Notes**

\(i\) In the preceding songs, the Āḻvār addressed the world around but his advice fell on deaf cars, as before. In sheer disgust he withdraws unto himself, satisfied that he could get back from the earthly poets, uncontaminated, like unto a person clearing a dacoit-infested area, without getting robbed.

\(ii\) *Thousand names*: Doesn’t mean exactly thousand. Actually, it connotes innumerable names, even as His glory is inexhaustible.

\(iii\) *While lies*: Abominable lies, without the slightest tinge of truth.




## 3.9.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வேயின் மலிபுரை தோளி பின்னைக்கு மணாளனை,  
ஆய பெரும்புகழ் எல்லை இலாதன பாடிப்போய்,  
காயம் கழித்து அவன் தாள் இணைக்கீழ்ப் புகும் காதலன்,  
மாய மனிசரை என் சொல்ல வல்லேன் என் வாய்கொண்டே?

vēyiṉ malipurai tōḷi piṉṉaikku maṇāḷaṉai,  
āya perumpukaḻ ellai ilātaṉa pāṭippōy,  
kāyam kaḻittu avaṉ tāḷ iṇaikkīḻp pukum kātalaṉ,  
māya maṉicarai eṉ colla vallēṉ eṉ vāykoṇṭē?

**English translation of verse 3.9.8:**

With passion deep to sing the limitless glory of the consort  
Of Piṉṉai with shoulders pretty, for a long, long time  
And then discard my body and attain His lovely feet,  
Shall my tongue praise, at all, men in mundane moorings?

**Notes**

\(i\) Even as the Lord cut out the impediments in the way of attaining the charming Nappiṉṉai, He destroyed all the obstacles confronting the Āḻvār in attaining Him. When, at last, the material body is shaken off, the Āḻvār will acquire non-physical (*ultra*-mundane) body and serve the Lord, staying at His feet all the time. How could such a one ever think of singing the praise of the miserable mortals caught up in the mesh of mundane life?

\(ii\) The Lord's glory is unlimited and it can bear any amount of lauding for any length of time. Such being the case, there is hardly any scope for turning one’s attention on others. Even if the Āḻvār be inclined to sing the praise of others, his tongue would not be a party to it.




## 3.9.9
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வாய்கொண்டு மானிடம் பாடவந்த கவியேன் அல்லேன்.  
ஆய்கொண்ட சீர்வள்ளல் ஆழிப் பிரான் எனக்கே உளன்,  
சாய் கொண்ட இம்மையும் சாதித்து வானவர் நாட்டையும்,  
நீ கண்டுகொள் என்று வீடும் தரும் நின்றுநின்றே!

vāykoṇṭu māṉiṭam pāṭavanta kaviyēṉ allēṉ.  
āykoṇṭa cīrvaḷḷal āḻip pirāṉ eṉakkē uḷaṉ,  
cāy koṇṭa immaiyum cātittu vāṉavar nāṭṭaiyum,  
nī kaṇṭukoḷ eṉṟu vīṭum tarum niṉṟuniṉṟē!

**English translation of verse 3.9.9:**

I am not the poet born to extol the frail humans,  
My tongue shall praise only the Lord holding the discus,  
The Donor great, full of qualities auspicious,  
Who presents Himself here in iconic Form delicious  
And grants heavenly bliss in due course.

**Notes**

\(i\) The Āḻvār will not sing the praise of any but the extremely generous Lord. Although several Sages and Saints including the other Āḻvārs have sung the Lord’s glory, Nammāḻvār’s poems are hymns with a difference, of peerless excellence.

\(ii\) Although the Āḻvār has expressed his abhorrence of this hairowing abode with its evil propensities, in several places, earlier, he does not mind eking cut his stay here, because of the Lord’s living presence, right here, in His iconic Form, a bliss which compares favourable with, rather excels, heavenly bliss. As a matter of fact, the Āḻvār asked the Lord in stanza 53 of ‘Periya Tituvantāti’ whether the heavenly bliss which He grants, is by-any-means superior to the sweet contemplation of His infinite glory.

\(iii\) *In due course*: Nampiḷḷai is of the view that the heavenly bliss is granted by the Lord duly regulated with regard to the capacity of the recipient, just like a person who has been on a month-long fast, breaking the fast by stages before he resumes the normal in-take of food. This theme has already been elaborated upon, in the preamble to 1-9. Other commentators have, however, interpreted the corresponding phrase in the original text of this stanza as ‘In due course’, that is, at the appropriate time.




## 3.9.10
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நின்றுநின்று பல நாள் உய்க்கும் இவ் உடல் நீங்கிப்போய்,  
சென்று சென்று ஆகிலும் கண்டு சன்மம் கழிப்பான் எண்ணி,  
ஒன்றிஒன்றி உலகம் படைத்தான் கவி ஆயினேற்கு,  
என்றும் என்றும் இனி மற்றொருவர் கவி ஏற்குமே?

niṉṟuniṉṟu pala nāḷ uykkum iv uṭal nīṅkippōy,  
ceṉṟu ceṉṟu ākilum kaṇṭu caṉmam kaḻippāṉ eṇṇi,  
oṉṟioṉṟi ulakam paṭaittāṉ kavi āyiṉēṟku,  
eṉṟum eṉṟum iṉi maṟṟoruvar kavi ēṟkumē?

**English translation of verse 3.9.10:**

Would it be appropriate if I, the poet of the zealous Lord  
Who with the creation of the worlds goes on, full of hopes  
That His subjects will some day (sooner or later) give up  
The age-long shackles of the material body and attain Him,  
Sang the glory of any one else, any more?

**Notes**

\(i\) At a time when the individual soul was lying defunct, just as inert as the non-sentient matter, devoid of the capacity to lament or enjoy, it was the Lord’s boundless grace that put the Souls back on their feet, by endowing them with body, limbsand sense-organs, foreking out their progress. Against this background, the Āḻvār queries how the limbs, designed for the Lord’s service, can be put to any other use.

\(ii\) In the ancient farm of ‘Saṃsārā’, the Lord, as an indefatigable and time-honoured Cultivator, has been raising crop after crop (world after world) hoping for a richer harvest of ‘Bhakti’ (devotion) every time. There are four different routes taken by the Souls when they depart from the material bodies, namely, (1) garbhagathi, (2) yāmyagathi, (3) Dhūmagathi and (4) Arcirādi gathi. Although the Lord looks forward to the subjects attaining Him through the last-mentioned ascent of ‘Arcirādi gathi’, they ate mostly moving away from Him, through the other routes. But that does not deter Him and He gets on with His work of creation, hoping for better results, some day, sooner or later. The Āḻvār says that the Lord’s unremitting labour has yielded the desired fruit, at least in his case, inasmuch as he has become the Lord’s poet, singing exclusively His glory.




## 3.9.11
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஏற்கும் பெரும்புகழ் வானவர் ஈசன் கண்ணன் தனக்கு,  
ஏற்கும் பெரும்புகழ் வண் குருகூர்ச் சடகோபன் சொல்,  
ஏற்கும் பெரும்புகழ் ஆயிரத்துள் இவையும் ஓர் பத்து,  
ஏற்கும் பெரும்புகழ் சொல்ல வல்லார்க்கு இல்லை சன்மமே.

ēṟkum perumpukaḻ āyirattuḷ ivaiyum ōr pattu,  
ēṟkum perumpukaḻ colla vallārkku illai caṉmamē.

**English translation of verse 3.9.11:**

Those that recite these praiseworthy songs ten,  
Out of the praiseworthy thousand uttered  
By the praiseworthy Kurukūr Caṭakōpaṉ,  
Adoring Kaṇṇaṉ, the praiseworthy Lord,  
Chief of the Celestials, will from births be freed.

**Notes**

\(i\) Those that recite these ten stanzas will not run the risk of being born again and hankering after the earthly patrons, lauding them.

\(ii\) The Lord is praiseworthy, as the Supreme Master of all the worlds.

The Āḻvār is praiseworthy, as the Lord’s poet, an appellation which fits him admirably;

Tiruvāymoḻi is praiseworthy, as the ‘Dramiḍa Veda’, truly reflecting the Lord like a mirror and this decad is praiseworthy, in as much as it enjoins upon every one to preserve, *in tact*, the essential nature (svarūpa) by singing exclusively the Lord’s glory and prohibiting the profanation of the tongue and the poetic talent, in singing the praise of others.
