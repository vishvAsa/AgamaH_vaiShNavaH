## 00 Intro3.6
In the preceding decad, the Āḻvār extolled the devotees thrown into a state of ecstasy, enraptured by the contemplation of the Lord’s wondrous deeds and auspicious traits, moving about, all the time singing and dancing. In the same breath he spoke disparagingly of those who do not exhibit this kind of behaviour but remain callously indifferent, unmoved by and impervious to the glory of the Lord. But then, the Āḻvār, known for his deep compassion and love for the fellow-beings, wished to bring round even those in the latter category and impress, in their mind, the Lord’s extraordinary trait of tender solicitude and easy accessibility. No doubt, the Āḻvār had already expatiated on this in 1-3, but that was in terms of the Lord’s incarnations (Vibhava aspect). And now, in this decad, the Āḻvār expounds the Lord’s ‘Saulabhya’ easy accessibility in His Iconic Form which is not only the most easily accessible but also the very embodiment of every known and conceivable good quality in a perfect measure, a complete enumeration whereof would be beyond the capacity of the omniscient Lord Himself. Verily, the Lord’s Arcā (Iconic) manifestation is the very acme, the farthest limit of His wonderful trait of ‘Saulabhya’. Nampiḷḷai likens the Āḻvār’s great gesture to that of Sītā, the captive in Laṅkā, who tendered wholesome advice to the lustful Rāvaṇa who desired to have promiscuous relation with the Divine Mother, mistaking her for a mere woman. Even as the Āḻvār made no secret of his vexation, in the last decad, of callous indifference and aloofness of men devoid of God-love, Sītā too got vexed with Rāvaṇa’s amorous advances and the dearth of wholesome counsellors in the land, who could bring round this fiend of a fellow, terribly love-smitten. But, being grace personified, she herself counselled him to befriend Rāma and avoid a gruesome death.

The ninth song is the crucial one high-lighting the theme of this decad.




## 3.6.1
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

செய்ய தாமரைக் கண்ணன் ஆய் உலகு ஏழும் உண்ட அவன் கண்டீர்,  
வையம் வானம் மனிசர் தெய்வம் மற்றும் மற்றும் மற்றும் முற்றும் ஆய்,  
செய்யசூழ் சுடர் ஞானம் ஆய் வெளிப் பட்டு இவை படைத்தான் பின்னும்  
மொய்கொள் சோதியோடு ஆயினான் ஒரு மூவர் ஆகிய மூர்த்தியே. (2)

**English translation of verse 3.6.1:**

Know ye, ‘tis the red lotus-eyed Lord, Who did once contain  
In His stomach, the worlds seven  
And created this Earth, the upper regions, the humans,  
Devas, beasts, plants and all else thro’ His knowledge radiant;  
He has His abode in the heaven resplendent  
And carries out (the triple functions), standing as the Trinity.

**Notes**

\(i\) The opening stanza deals with the Lord’s ‘Paratva’, the transcendental glory, although this decad is intended to spotlight the Lord’s ‘Saulabhya’, or easy accessibility. Indeed, the Lord’s ‘Paratva’ serves as a foil against which His astounding simplicity becomes even more pronounced and amazing and hence the Āḻvār begins with this complementary role of the Lord.

\(ii\) The red lotus-eyes proclaim the Lord’s supremacy. *c.f*. tasya yathā kapyāsam puṇḍarīkaṃ evaṃ akṣiṇī, (Chāndogyopaniṣad). The Lord’s eyes, highlight His Supremacy, as far as His form is concerned; likewise among His many attributes, ‘pralayāpatsakhatva’ or sustenance of the worlds with their variegated contents inside His stomach during the ‘pralaya’ (deluge), brings into focus His Supremacy over all the rest, the ‘Container’ *vis-a-vis* the ‘Contained’.

\(iii\) Of the triple functions of creation, sustentation and dissolution, the middle one is attended to by the Lord Himself, standing as Viṣṇu, while the other two functions are carried out by Him through Brahmā and Śiva respectively, as their Internal Controller. Whereas Brahmā and Śiva were produced by the Lord, Viṣṇu, standing in between, as a member of the Trinity, is the Lord Himself Who has none above, to create Him. In the cycle of cause and effect, if we go back from effect to cause of all things and beings, we will ultimately be left with the Lord who is His own cause, the Causeless Cause.




## 3.6.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மூவர் ஆகிய மூர்த்தியை முதல் மூவர்க்கும் முதல்வன் தன்னை,  
சாவம் உள்ளன நீக்குவானை தடங் கடல் கிடந்தான் தன்னை,  
தேவ தேவனை தென் இலங்கை எரி எழச் செற்ற வில்லியை,  
பாவ நாசனை பங்கயத்தடங் கண்ணனைப் பரவுமினோ.

mūvar ākiya mūrttiyai mutal mūvarkkum mutalvaṉ taṉṉai,  
cāvam uḷḷaṉa nīkkuvāṉai taṭaṅ kaṭal kiṭantāṉ taṉṉai,  
tēva tēvaṉai teṉ ilaṅkai eri eḻac ceṟṟa villiyai,  
pāva nācaṉai paṅkayattaṭaṅ kaṇṇaṉaip paravumiṉō.

**English translation of verse 3.6.2:**

Sing the glory of the immaculate Lord,  
With large lotus-eyes, who set Laṅkā ablaze and destroyed  
The enemies with His bow valiant, Chief of Celestials,  
Destroyer of sins, who the Devas’ distress dispels.  
Foremost among the first three, He does the Trinity compose  
And on the broad milky oceaṇ repose.

**Notes**

\(i\) On being told about the Lord’s transcendent glory, as in the preceding song, the Āḻvār was questioned by his listeners as to how they could at all propitiate such an exalted overlord. The Āḻvār, however, puts them at ease by pointing out in this song, the Lord’s simplicity in His incarnate Form as Rāma.

\(ii\) “*First and foremost, Who the Trinity composes*”: Please see note (iii), in the preceding song. Lord Viṣṇu’s supremacy over Brahmā and Śiva is further pointed out here, in that He dispels their distress and among those thus relieved could be added Indra and other Devas. In order to eliminate the possible confusion by including Viṣṇu as a member of the Trinity and making others look upon Him, mistakenly of course, as on a par with the other two, namely, Brahmā and Śiva, the trinity could be taken, within the meaning of this song, to comprise Brahmā, Śiva and Indra. Even otherwise, it may be pointed out that unlike the other two, namely, Brahmā and Śiva, Viṣṇu, standing in between, is His own cause (the Causeless Cause) as well as the Cause of the other two.

\(iii\) “*Set fire to Laṇkā*”: Rāma’s peerless bow played a lot of havoc and set fire to Rāvaṇa’s Laṅkā which ‘Agni’, the fire-God, as one of the several elemental forces, Rāvaṇa had kept under strict control, dared not enter before.

\(iv\) “*Destroyer of sins*”: As Sage Agastya put it, the mere sight of Rāma, the immaculate Lord, with bow in hand, will destroy all our sins.




## 3.6.3
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

பரவி வானவர் ஏத்த நின்ற பரமனை பரஞ்சோதியை,  
குரவை கோத்த குழகனை மணி வண்ணனை குடக் கூத்தனை,  
அரவம் ஏறி அலை கடல் அமரும் துயில்கொண்ட அண்ணலை,  
இரவும் நன் பகலும் விடாது என்றும் ஏத்துதல் மனம் வைம்மினோ.

paravi vāṉavar ētta niṉṟa paramaṉai parañcōtiyai,  
kuravai kōtta kuḻakaṉai maṇi vaṇṇaṉai kuṭak kūttaṉai,  
aravam ēṟi alai kaṭal amarum tuyilkoṇṭa aṇṇalai,  
iravum naṉ pakalum viṭātu eṉṟum ēttutal maṉam vaimmiṉō.

**English translation of verse 3.6.3:**

Day and night, without break, sing the glory of the supreme Lord,  
Set your mind on Him, by Devas profusely lauded,  
Who did (with Gopīs) tastefully dance, hand in hand,  
Of superlative splendour, the Pot-dancer of the complexion  
Of blue gem, reposing on His serpent-bed, in the surging ocean.

**Notes**

\(i\) And now, the Āḻvār introduces his audience to the Lord’s Avatāra as Kṛṣṇa, of unsurpassed simplicity and calls upon the folks to set their minds firmly on Him who cannot but be loved because of His loving condescension, tender solicitude, unique charm, adorability and a host of other auspicious attributes.

Tradition has it that Mother Earth bitterly complained to Brahmā about the atrocious burden she had to carry, with demoniac forces like Kaṃsa and Śiśupāla let loose on Earth. Brahmā and other Devas then made a bee-line to the Lord who was reclining on His serpent-bed in the milky ocean and petitioned to Him. Thereupon, the Lord came down as Kṛṣṇa and His task duly done, He went back to the Milky-ocean and rested on Ādiśeṣa, as before.

\(ii\) *The dance with the Gopīs*: It was a classical autumn night in the bright fortnight, the unique night of unparalleled excellence when the marvel of a dance, the immortal ‘Rāsa Krīḍā’, took place. ‘Śrī Kṛṣṇa played’ on His inimitable flute, sending out sweet strains of music in all directions with their irresistible appeal to the young damsels of the pastoral village. They all left their homes, defying obstruction from the elders and converged towaids the magic flautist. And then ensued the marvel of marvels, the wonderful wonder of wonders, the circular dance in which the ubiquitous Kṛṣṇa made Himself so very pliable as to be seen in between one Gopī and another, multiplying Himself in this fashion. Oh, how astounding that the Overlord of the Celestials in heaven should come down to Earth and mingle so freely with the shepherd-folks and be quite at home with them! And to those who missed witnessing this grand spectacle, He would exhibit His physical charm right at the cross-roads as the skilful Pot-dancer.




## 3.6.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வைம்மின் நும் மனத்து என்று யான் உரைக்கின்ற மாயவன் சீர்மையை  
எம்மனோர்கள் உரைப்பது என்? அது நிற்க நாள்தொறும், வானவர்  
தம்மை ஆளும் அவனும் நான்முகனும் சடைமுடி அண்ணலும்,  
செம்மையால் அவன் பாத பங்கயம் சிந்தித்து ஏத்தித் திரிவரே.

cemmaiyāl avaṉ pāta paṅkayam cintittu ēttit tirivarē.

**English translation of verse 3.6.4:**

Let alone my telling you about the wondrous Lord,  
Calling upon you to set on Him your mind,  
His glory and goodness are such that Indra, the Devas’ overlord,  
Nāṉmukaṉ (Brahmā) and Śiva of matted locks reverently contemplate  
And are in the worship of His lotus feet for ever engaged.

**Note**

The Āḻvār tells his listeners: “Apart from people of my ilk dinning into your ears the Lord’s easy accessibility and his many other auspicious traits, I want you to note how Indra, Brahmā and Śiva, worshipped by many as their God, themselves keep meditating all the time on Lord Viṣṇu’s glory and goodness and worship His lotus feet. If the supreme Lord has made Himself so pliable even to the self-seekers for facility of their worship, what more need I tell you about His easy accessibility and easy worshippability by those whose minds are rivetted on Him, as an end in itself?”




## 3.6.5
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

திரியும் காற்றோடு அகல் விசும்பு திணிந்த மண் கிடந்த கடல்,  
எரியும் தீயோடு இரு சுடர் தெய்வம், மற்றும் மற்றும் முற்றும் ஆய்,  
கரிய மேனியன் செய்ய தாமரைக் கண்ணன் கண்ணன் விண்ணோர் இறை,  
சுரியும் பல் கருங் குஞ்சி எங்கள் சுடர் முடி அண்ணல் தோற்றமே.

**English translation of verse 3.6.5:**

The red lotus-eyed Kaṇṇaṉ of bluish hue, Chief of Celestials,  
With dark curly locks, wearing the radiant crown,  
Is manifest in the elements five, Sun and Moon,  
Devas, humans and other species, one and all.

**Note**

The Āḻvār speaks here of both the universal (lines 3 and 4) and the exclusive Individual (lines 1 and 2) Forms of the Lord, as visualised by him. (Aṟāyirappaṭi).




## 3.6.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

தோற்றம் கேடு அவை இல்லவன் உடையான் அவன் ஒரு மூர்த்தியாய்,  
சீற்றத்தோடு அருள் பெற்றவன் அடிக்கீழ்ப் புகநின்ற செங்கண்மால்,  
நாற்றம் தோற்றம் சுவை ஒலி உறல் ஆகி நின்ற, எம் வானவர்

**English translation of verse 3.6.6:**

At no time shall I seek refuge in any one,  
Other than my red lotus-eyed Lord, full of love For his devotees  
Who is unto me all the senses five.  
The subtle matter of smell, colour, taste, touch and sound;  
Chief of Celestials, free from birth and death,  
He owns us all mortals; the peerless one (Naraciṅka) full of fury He was  
And yet stood at His feet (Prahlāda) the recipient of His grace.

**Notes**

\(i\) The Āḻvār avers that He belongs to none but Naraciñka, the incarnate Form of the Lord, who exhibited boundless love for Prahlāda. To the question put to Śrī Rāmānuja, how the little lad, Prahlāda, could at all approach the ferocious Naraciṅka, when He was pouring His unmitigated wrath on Hhaṇya, the great Ācārya replied in a homely way that eveṅ while the lion attacks the elephant, the lion cub could jolly well suck milk from the mother’s teats.

\(ii\) The eyes of the Lord could be red, both ways, that is, due to the wrath of Naraciṅka for Hiraṇya or due to His tender love for Prahlāda.

\(iii\) The five senses, namely, smell, sight, taste, sound and touch, which are differently experienced by the worldlings with reference to the external objects of the visible world, are all experienced in the Lord Himself by the Āḻvār, like unto the ‘Nitya Sūris’ (ever-free angels) in Heaven. These senses have a meaning for them only in relation to God-enjoyment.




## 3.6.7
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

எழுமைக்கும் எனது ஆவிக்கு இன்அமுதத்தினை எனது ஆர் உயிர்,  
கெழுமிய கதிர்ச் சோதியை மணிவண்ணனை குடக் கூத்தனை,  
விழுமிய அமரர் முனிவர் விழுங்கும் கன்னல் கனியினை,  
தொழுமின் தூய மனத்தர் ஆய் இறையும் நில்லா துயரங்களே.

eḻumaikkum eṉatu āvikku iṉamutattiṉai eṉatu ār uyir,  
keḻumiya katirc cōtiyai maṇivaṇṇaṉai kuṭak kūttaṉai,  
viḻumiya amarar muṉivar viḻuṅkum kaṉṉal kaṉiyiṉai,  
toḻumiṉ tūya maṉattar āy iṟaiyum nillā tuyaraṅkaḷē.

**English translation of verse 3.6.7:**

If, with a mind clean, you worship the Lord,  
The candy fruit, by Sages and Devas devoured,  
My soul’s eternal nectar, of sapphire hue, the beacon-light in my dear soul, absorbed,  
The pot-dancer, You will from miseries be completely absolved.

**Notes**

\(i\) The Āḻvār exhorts his listeners to shake off their fear of an unapproachable, distant Lord, by emphasising His easy-accessibility and enormous love for His devotees. There was indeed a time, when he too was afraid of mingling with the Lord, lest he should defile Him, but now, freed from such a complex, he is in grand communion with the Lord and his tempo goes up all the time beaming with God-love.

\(ii\) The cleanliness of mind, referred to here, is freedom from doubt and despair, fear and fright, in the matter of worshipping the highly adorable Lord of loving condescension, which tend to lead one astray into the domain of sensual pleasures. Shorn of all such doubts and fears, the Āḻvār exhorts people to attach themselves solely to the Lord seeking no personal gains, and thus get absolved of all their sins.




## 3.6.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

துயரமே தரு துன்ப இன்ப வினைகள் ஆய் அவை அல்லன் ஆய்,  
உயர நின்றது ஓர் சோதி ஆய் உலகு ஏழும் உண்டு உமிழ்ந்தான் தன்னை,  
அயர வாங்கும் நமன் தமர்க்கு அரு நஞ்சினை அச்சுதன் தன்னை,  
தயரதற்கு மகன் தன்னை அன்றி மற்று இலேன் தஞ்சமாகவே.

tuyaramē taru tuṉpa iṉpa viṉaikaḷ āy avai allaṉ āy,  
uyara niṉṟatu ōr cōti āy ulaku ēḻum uṇṭu umiḻntāṉ taṉṉai,  
ayara vāṅkum namaṉ tamarkku aru nañciṉai accutaṉ taṉṉai,  
tayarataṟku makaṉ taṉṉai aṉṟi maṟṟu ilēṉ tañcamākavē.

**English translation of verse 3.6.8:**

I seek refuge in none but Tayarataṉ’s Son,  
Accutaṉ (the Protector steadfast), the deadly poison  
Unto Namaṉ’s cruel hordes, Who the worlds seven  
Did once sustain and later spat them out  
The heavenly light of splendour unique, dealing out,  
Rewards and punishments for acts, good and bad  
And yet by them, by no means affected.

**Notes**

\(i\) The Āḻvār declares his firm faith in Śrī Rāma (who incarnated as King Daśaratha’s son) as his sole Refuge, in order to infuse in others a similar interest in the Lord.

\(ii\) As the upaniṣads put it, the so-called rewards for good acts also operate as impediments for entry into Heaven and are thus no better then punishments undergone for bad acts. The best thing, therefore, is to look upon the Lord as the sole Refuge, the ‘Means’ and the ‘End’ rolled into one, instead of aspiring for the fruits of one’s actions.

\(iii\) *Daśaratha’s son*: The Lord was born as Rāma, Son of King Daśaratha, totally subservient to the father, subject to any kind of treatment at the latter’s will. The king would now say that he is gifting away the kingdom to Rāma and a little hence ask him to go into exile!

\(iv\) Speaking about taking refuge at the feet of the Lord, there are some passages in the Īṭu commentary, which are very interesting and instructive. The Image of Kṛṣṇa, the child, fond of eating butter, was worshipped by Śrī Rāmānuja, as the household God. One day, a disciple handed over to the Preceptor an Image of Śrī Rāma. Thereupon the Ācārya exclaimed; “Oh, He who did not impose the condition of seeking Him as sole Refuge, has come”. What was conveyed here by the great Preceptor was that Śrī Rāma was satisfied if one sought asylum in Him but once, saying that he belonged to Him. On the other hand, Śrī Kṛṣṇa laid down, “Resort to me as your sole Refuge”, as a spiritual rule, so to say. The statement that no more than affectionate yielding or non-opposition when the Lord’s grace is offered is needed as the price for salvation, only signifies the infinite mercy and readiness to reclaim, on the part of the Lord, as the great Redeemer of the straying Subjects. If, however, one started enumerating the positive qualifications on the part of the Individual to deserve the Lord’s grace, one has to begin with ‘implicit trust in, and abandonment to God’ (mahāviśvāsa), which again is very difficult of attainment indeed. If a traveller on a long seavoyage could trust himself to a mere floating wood (ship) and supplement it with a storage of food and water for six months, all inanimate things, should we not have some such confidence at least in God as our Means of salvation, that is, crossing the much bigger ocean of Saṃsāra?




## 3.6.9
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

தஞ்சம் ஆகிய தந்தை தாயொடு தானும் ஆய் அவை அல்லன் ஆய்,  
எஞ்சல் இல் அமரர் குலமுதல் மூவர் தம்முள்ளும் ஆதியை,  
அஞ்சி நீர் உலகத்துள்ளீர்கள்! அவன் இவன் என்று கூழேன்மின்,  
நெஞ்சினால் நினைப்பான் எவன் அவன் ஆகும் நீள் கடல் வண்ணனே.

tañcam ākiya tantai tāyoṭu tāṉum āy avai allaṉ āy,  
eñcal il amarar kulamutal mūvar tammuḷḷum ātiyai,  
añci nīr ulakattuḷḷīrkaḷ! avaṉ ivaṉ eṉṟu kūḻēṉmiṉ,  
neñciṉāl niṉaippāṉ evaṉ avaṉ ākum nīḷ kaṭal vaṇṇaṉē.

**English translation of verse 3.6.9:**

Ye, men of the world, be not scared (of the supremacy)  
Of our Lord, Chief of the Celestials, foremost of the three,  
He is the Father benign, Mother and much more, you see,  
Be not agitated whether He is other than the one in Image Form  
(You behold here); be sure, the Lord of oceanic hue does assume  
Whatever form you in your mind lovingly conceive of Him.

**Notes**

\(i\) The worldlings, addressed by the Āḻvār, expressed their difficulty in worshipping the Lord currently, either in His transcendent form or in His incarnate forms as Rāma or Kṛṣṇa. The Āḻvār puts them at ease by telling them now that the Lord is easily worshippable in any form they like, without any loss or diminution of His divine prowess and that they can, therefore, worship Him easily in His ‘Arcā’ (image) Form. This song is thus the key note of this decad and all the preceding eight songs have only served as a preamble.

\(ii\) As we see among our earthly relations, the mother is different from the father. The Lord is, however, our eternal Father as well as Mother and has an individuality of His own, being very different from the earthly parents. The earthly parents have their own limitations and are not also always dependable, their own interests superseding those of the progeny. Instances of parents giving up their young ones under certain circumstances are not wanting. Further, it is our Karma that binds us to our earthly parents and this artificial link gets automatically severed with the severance of our own bonds of Karma, our relationship with the Lord is, however, eternal, being inalienable.

Further, there is scarcely a relationship which the Lord cannot assume, in regard to His subjects, being All-in-one, Father, Mother and all other conceivable relations put together.




## 3.6.10
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கடல்வண்ணன் கண்ணன் விண்ணவர் கருமாணிக்கம் எனது ஆர் உயிர்  
படஅரவின் அணைக்கிடந்த பரஞ்சுடர் பண்டு நூற்றுவர்,

**English translation of verse 3.6.10:**

When shall I behold the victorious feet of my Lord,  
‘Kaṇṇaṉ’ of oceanic hue, by those in Heaven adored,  
Like unto a blue gem, the supreme light, my Soul dear,  
Reclining on hooded serpent, unto the five (Pāṇḍavas) dear,  
Who drove Arjuna’s chariot and did the armies annihilate,  
Slaying the hundred (Kauravas) in the war of Mahābhāraṭa?

**Note**

Having expounded the Lord’s easy-accessibility (Saulabhya) in all His manifestations, right up to the ‘Arcā’ (Iconic Form) the Āḻvār is now deeply absorbed in the Lord’s incarnate form as Kṛṣṇa, because it was in this Avatāra that he caught the first glimpses of the Lord’s amazing simplicity and went into a trance state, lasting several months. Picturing in his mind Kṛṣṇa, the Charioteer holding the whip and the reins, with the hair on his uncrowned bare head covered by the dust from the battlefield and a pair of legs dangling from the chariot, the Āḻvār hears (fanciful, of course) ṭhe tingling sound of the ornaments worn on those legs and this is enough to stir up in him a strong desire to behold the Lord’s exquisite Form.




## 3.6.11
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கண்கள் காண்டற்கு அரியன் ஆய் கருத்துக்கு நன்றும் எளியன் ஆய்,  
மண்கொள் ஞாலத்து உயிர்க்கு எல்லாம் அருள் செய்யும் வானவர் ஈசனை,

paṇkoḷ āyirattu ippattāl pattar ākak kūṭum payilumiṉē. (2)

**English translation of verse 3.6.11:**

Learn these songs ten out of the thousand tunefully composed  
By Caṭakōpaṉ of Vaḻutināṭu, the doyen of fertile Kurukūr,  
In adoration of the Supreme Lord, difficult to behold  
But easy to meditate, Who sheds His grace galore  
(Making Himself visible to one and all in this world,  
In His Image Form); you will also become devotees pure.

**Notes**

\(i\) *Difficult to behold but easy to meditate*: The Āḻvār does not enjoy the physical presence of the Lord and, therefore, regretfully observes that the Lord is difficult to behold. Out of sight but not out of mind, as his forward mind keeps meditating on Him. As a matter of fact, throughout this work, the Āḻvār’s union with the Lord only connotes his mental comprehension of the Lord’s vision, almost on a par with His physical presence and the Āḻvār’s separation from the Lord arises when he longs for the external perception of the Lord as well and his intuitive inner vision gets cut out in the bargain.

\(ii\) Chanting this decad, which highlights the Lord’s amazingly easy-accessibility in His manifestation, will, by itself, engender God-love, Even as people will start a ‘Treasure hunt’ digging the ground deep, at the place where the sign-board “Here lies a treasure, buried” is put up, the Āḻvār expects people, in quest of God-love to chant this decad.
