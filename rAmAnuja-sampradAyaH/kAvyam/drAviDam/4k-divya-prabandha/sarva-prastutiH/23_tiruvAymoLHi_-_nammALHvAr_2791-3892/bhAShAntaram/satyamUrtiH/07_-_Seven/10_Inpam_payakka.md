## 00 Intro7.10
In the last decad, the Āḻvār, who thought in terms of repaying the Lord’s kindness in choosing him, of all persons, for the sacred mission of singing ‘Tiruvāymoḻi’, was bewildered on finding nothing, he could offer unto the Lord, for there wasn’t anything he could call his own and the Lord, who is above wants of any kind, would need anything from him either. The merciful Lord would not, however, keep a devotee of such a high order in a state of mental torture. And so, He told the Āḻvār that he too would be given a chance to fulfil his desire by singing this hymnal in the pilgrim centre, called ‘Tiruvāṟaṉviḷai’ (Kerala State), unto Him and His Divine Consorts, much to Their delectation. It may be recalled, at this stage, that Śrī Rāma listened to His own story, Rāmāyaṇa, sung by Kuśa and Lava, the Divine lads, His own progeny. Even so, it was not on all fours with the assignment currently given to the Āḻvār by the Lord. There Śrī Rāma was alone when He granted audience to the young minstrels, having got separated from Sītā, the Divine Mother, whose story, (Sītāyāścaritam mahat) Rāmāyaṇa virtually is. But here, the Lord in His Iconic form, is looking forward to the ecstatic experience of listening to the rapturous songs of Tiruvāymoḻi, sung by the love-intoxicated Āḻvār, in the company of His Divine Consorts. The Āḻvār leaps with joy, finding that the Lord not only got the hymns sung by him but was also intent upon listening to his chanting them. How gracious of Him indeed! The Āḻvār, therefore, attempts to render the service assigned to him, at Tiruvāṟaṉviḷai in this decad, looking upon that holy place as his final goal, to the exclusion of all else, even as Hanumān said ‘Bhāvonānyatragacchati’, thereby expressing his stout determination not to forsake this land trodden upon by Lord Rāma and go elsewhere, not even the much-coveted Heaven. As a matter of fact, God would have nothing of our own and there is nothing we can call our own either. All that He expects from us, in return for all that He does, is to do His bidding and this is taken by Him as adequate expression of our gratitude.




## 7.10.1
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

இன்பம் பயக்க எழில் மலர் மாதரும் தானும் இவ் ஏழ் உலகை,  
இன்பம் பயக்க இனிது உடன் வீற்றிருந்து ஆள்கின்ற எங்கள் பிரான்,  
அன்புற்று அமர்ந்து உறைகின்ற அணி பொழில் சூழ் திருவாறன்விளை,  
அன்புற்று அமர்ந்து வலஞ்செய்து கைதொழும் நாள்களும் ஆகும்கொலோ! (2)

iṉpam payakka eḻil malar mātarum tāṉum iv ēḻ ulakai,  
iṉpam payakka iṉitu uṭaṉ vīṟṟiruntu āḷkiṉṟa eṅkaḷ pirāṉ,  
aṉpuṟṟu amarntu uṟaikiṉṟa aṇi poḻil cūḻ tiruvāṟaṉviḷai,  
aṉpuṟṟu amarntu valañceytu kaitoḻum nāḷkaḷum ākumkolō! (2)

**English translation of verse 7.10.1:**

Will the good days draw near when I can lovingly go round,  
Tiruvāṟaṉviḷai which fine gardens surround,  
And worship my Sire who happily rules all the worlds,  
And now stays there in the gay company of Lakṣmī, the lotus-born?

**Notes:**

\(i\) The Lord has indeed chosen an enchanting place from where He and His consort could enjoy listening to Tiruvāymoḻi recital by Saint Nammāḻvār. The Āḻvār is eagerly looking forward to his visit to this pilgrim centre.

\(ii\) Happy indeed is the blissful union of the Divine Couple and happy indeed are the subjects who behold this holy conjunction; on seeing the happiness of the subjects, the pleasure of the Divine couple gets enhanced like unto the mother happily watching the babe sucking milk from her breast.

\(iii\) When Śrī Rāma took leave of Queen Kauśalyā while setting out on exile, the venerable mother wished that that very day could also be the day of His return from exile, if at all he had to go. Likewise the Āḻvār pines for quick consummation of his desire to reach this holy centre.




## 7.10.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஆகும்கொல் ஐயம் ஒன்று இன்றி அகல் இடம் முற்றவும் ஈர் அடியே  
ஆகும்பரிசு நிமிர்ந்த திருக்குறள் அப்பன் அமர்ந்து உறையும்  
மாகம் திகழ் கொடி மாடங்கள் நீடு மதிள் திருவாறன்விளை,  
மாகந்த நீர்கொண்டு தூவி வலஞ்செய்து கைதொழக் கூடும்கொலோ!

ākumkol aiyam oṉṟu iṉṟi akal iṭam muṟṟavum īr aṭiyē

mākam tikaḻ koṭi māṭaṅkaḷ nīṭu matiḷ tiruvāṟaṉviḷai,  
mākanta nīrkoṇṭu tūvi valañceytu kaitoḻak kūṭumkolō!

**English translation of verse 7.10.2:**

Sprinkling water richly perfumed, shall I go round  
And worship at Tiruvāṟaṉviḷai, the walled city with castles tall  
And banners aloft, where stays lovingly my Sire, Vāmaṉaṉ, Who spanned  
In two strides, with no misgivings whatever, the worlds one and all?

**Notes:**

\(i\) Even now, the devout pilgrims visiting this centre besmear the temple walls with sweet-smelling sandal paste, echoing the sentiments of the Āḻvār as disclosed by this song.

\(ii\) Did not Śatrugna sprinkle ice-cold water all the way from Nandigrām to the Āśram of Sage Bharadvāja, to greet Śrī Rāma’s home-coming?




## 7.10.3
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கூடும் கொல் வைகலும் கோவிந்தனை மதுசூதனை கோளரியை,  
ஆடும் பறவைமிசைக் கண்டு கைதொழுது அன்றி அவன் உறையும்,  
பாடும் பெரும் புகழ் நான்மறை வேள்வி ஐந்து ஆறு அங்கம் பன்னினர் வாழ்,  
நீடு பொழில் திருவாறன்விளை தொழ வாய்க்கும்கொல் நிச்சலுமே!

kūṭum kol vaikalum kōvintaṉai matucūtaṉai kōḷariyai,  
āṭum paṟavaimicaik kaṇṭu kaitoḻutu aṉṟi avaṉ uṟaiyum,  
pāṭum perum pukaḻ nāṉmaṟai vēḷvi aintu āṟu aṅkam paṉṉiṉar vāḻ,  
nīṭu poḻil tiruvāṟaṉviḷai toḻa vāykkumkol niccalumē!

**English translation of verse 7.10.3:**

Shall I be so blest that I keep adoring for ever  
Tiruvāṟaṉviḻai, with its gardens big, where reside scholars.  
Performing the rituals five, chanting aloud the Vedas four and well-versed  
In their six adjuncts and worship the buoyant Hari, mounted on the victorious bird (Guaruḍa)  
Kōvintaṉ, Matucūtaṉ, my Lord, who the demons slew?  
When indeed will my longing deep be put through?

**Notes:**

Even as the Āḻvār adores the seat of the Lord and the devout over there more than the Lord Himself, the Lord reciprocated by adoring Kurukūr, the birth place of the Āḻvār. Therefore it was that He was speeding towards Kurukūr, mounted on Garuḍa. They have now met halfway at Tiruvāṟaṉviḷai. The Āḻvār enjoys the Lord at this holy centre as Kōvinta, the ardent Lover of the devout and as Hari and Matucūtaṉ, the Destroyer of the enemies of His devotees.




## 7.10.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வாய்க்கும்கொல் நிச்சலும் எப்பொழுதும் மனத்து ஈங்கு நினைக்கப்பெற  
வாய்க்கும் கரும்பும் பெரும் செந்நெலும் வயல் சூழ் திருவாறன்விளை,  
வாய்க்கும் பெரும் புகழ் மூவுலகு ஈசன் வடமதுரைப் பிறந்த,  
வாய்க்கும் மணி நிறக் கண்ண பிரான் தன் மலர் அடிப்போதுகளே.

vāykkumkol niccalum eppoḻutum maṉattu īṅku niṉaikkappeṟa

vāykkum perum pukaḻ mūvulaku īcaṉ vaṭamaturaip piṟanta,  
vāykkum maṇi niṟak kaṇṇa pirāṉ taṉ malar aṭippōtukaḷē.

**English translation of verse 7.10.4:**

When shall I the felicity acquire and without break contemplate  
The blooming lotus feet of Kaṇṇa, my Sire of saphire hue delectable,  
Who in Vaṭamaturai was born, the Supreme Lord of glory great,  
Residing in Tiruvāṟaṉviḷai with sugar-canes stout, paddy crops rich and fields fertile?

**Notes:**

\(i\) The Āḻvār pines for perpetual contemplation of the lotus feet of the Lord enshrined in Tiruvāṟaṉviḷai, from where he is, even if it be not possible for him to go over there. This contemplation is to run on, all the time, unlike the daily rituals like ‘Agnihotra’ which are confined to certain parts of the day only.

\(ii\) There is a Jitantā śloka, recited at the end of the daily worship of the Lord, which brings out that the mere longing to serve the Lord, right in this mortal body, is rated by the devotee higher than his ascent to Heaven and occupying an exalted position there.

\(ii\) Here is an interesting anecdote:

Iḷayāṟṟukkuṭi Nampi, a great devotee used to go to the temple at Śrīraṅgam [Śrīraṅga] during the festivals only, and kept on musing, with great delight, the proceedings of the last festival, till he attended the next festival. With declining age, the centenarian-devotee could not be present on the opening day of a festival, a fact, which the Deity took special note of and exclaimed “We doubt very much whether this is at all our festival when we don’t find our beloved Iḷayāṟṟukkuṭi Nampi around!” When the devotee presented himself with great dffiiculty on the sixth day of the festival, the Lord felt greatly pleased and enquired, “Nampi what can we do for you!” Nampi replied: “Sire this body dowered by you has done its job so far and now its mobility stands impaired”. “Well, said the Lord”, “if your body has dwindled, better stay with us”, Nampi breathed his last by the time the Deity left the temple gate for the ceremonial procession.




## 7.10.5
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மலர் அடிப்போதுகள் என் நெஞ்சத்து எப்பொழுதும் இருத்தி வணங்க,  
பலர் அடியார் முன்பு அருளிய பாம்பு அணை அப்பன் அமர்ந்து உறையும்,  
மலரின் மணி நெடு மாடங்கள் நீடு மதிள் திருவாறன்விளை,  
உலகம் மலி புகழ் பாட நம்மேல் வினை ஒன்றும் நில்லாகெடுமே.

malar aṭippōtukaḷ eṉ neñcattu eppoḻutum irutti vaṇaṅka,  
palar aṭiyār muṉpu aruḷiya pāmpu aṇai appaṉ amarntu uṟaiyum,  
malariṉ maṇi neṭu māṭaṅkaḷ nīṭu matiḷ tiruvāṟaṉviḷai,  
ulakam mali pukaḻ pāṭa nammēl viṉai oṉṟum nillākeṭumē.

**English translation of verse 7.10.5:**

The moment we sing the glory great, spread far and wide.  
Of the high-walled Tiruvāṟaṉviḷai where flowers abound,  
The castles tall beam and the Lord reposes on serpent-bed,  
Whose lotus feet lovely are for ever implanted in my mind,  
Who chose me over many others and His grace on me shed  
And made me wholly adore Him, all our sins will vanish indeed.

**Notes:**

The Āḻvār says, the Lord has shed His special grace on him, even as Śrī Rāma lavished special graces on Hanumān. See also notes under VII-9-6 in regard to the preferential treatment extended by the Lord to Nammāḻvār. Here is a fitting anecdote to illustrate how implicit faith in one’s masters works miracles.

A Cōla king, named Kṛmikaṇṭha [Krimikaṇṭha] (the worm-necked) launched a crusade on Vaiṣṇavism, determined to break the images of Viṣṇu in the temples all over. On his, however, being warned by his advisers of the disaster that would befall him, if specially consecrated idols like those of Lord Raṅganātha were demolished, the King hit upon a safeguard, namely, the appointment of a competent sorcerer, who would, by special incantations, render the images efféte, destroying their spiritual power. The sorcerer would make himself invisible by applying to his eyes a magical collyrium and then enter the Sanctoria of the Viṣṇu temples, extract the power from the idols enshrined there and then throw them into the sea. Greatly depressed by this turn of events and apprehending the calamitous repercussions of such an unholy project, Saint Rāmānuja had serious consultations with his Guru, Periya Nampi.

Periya Nampi decided that he shall pace round the periphery of the holy temple of Śrīraṅgam, thereby providing a cordon of protection and asked whether Śrī Rāmānuja could send a disciple to go with the great Master, literally as his shadow, with no thought of the self, as a separate entity. Śrī Rāmānuja very well knew that he had one such disciple, fully conforming to the specification of the master, in Kūrattāḻvāṉ and yet, he warted the choice to be made by the master himself. Śrī Rāmānuja, therefore, told his master, “Sire, I wonder whether there is any one answering to your description, a camp follower, who hardly feels that he is following another”. Periya Nampi was, however, quick to point out, “Well, Kūrattāḻvāṉ is surely one such. Let him be detailed for this service”.

Even as Kūrattāḻvaṉ was spotted out by the master, out of so many, the Lord pitched upon Nammāḻvār for shedding on him the divine grace!




## 7.10.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஒன்றும் நில்லா கெடும் முற்றவும் தீவினை உள்ளித் தொழுமின் தொண்டீர்,  
அன்று அங்கு அமர் வென்று உருப்பிணி நங்கை அணி நெடும் தோள் புணர்ந்தான்,  
என்றும் எப்போதும் என் நெஞ்சம் துதிப்ப உள்ளே இருக்கின்ற பிரான்,  
நின்ற அணி திருவாறன்விளை என்னும் நீள் நகரம் அதுவே.

eṉṟum eppōtum eṉ neñcam tutippa uḷḷē irukkiṉṟa pirāṉ,  
niṉṟa aṇi tiruvāṟaṉviḷai eṉṉum nīḷ nakaram atuvē.

**English translation of verse 7.10.6:**

Ye, votaries, all your dire sins will get destroyed  
If you could with reverence meditate on the city great,  
The lovely Tiruvāṟaṉviḷai, where resides the Lord,  
Who once came off with flying colours in a skirmish and caught  
Uruppiṇi, the damsel, bejewelled and enchanting, in embrace tight  
And is in my mind firm, for me always to contemplate.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The Āḻvār beckons the Lord’s votaries to just meditate on holy Tiruvāṟaṉviḷai to get all their ills and evils eradicated, *in totto*. We can, at best, wipe off only an infinitesimal fraction of our sins, through our own efforts, but the Lord’: grace will wipe them off in full.

\(ii\) Uruppiṇi (Rukmiṇi), an incarnation of Māhalakṣmī, was the only daughter of Bhīṣmaka, king of Kuṇṭinam. She had five brothers. When she came of marriagable age, Śrī Kṛṣṇa went and sought out her hand but her brother Rukmaṇ opposed it. Intending that she should be married to Śiśupāla, he arranged for her Svayamvara, when several kings would assemble, from whom the bride could choose the one most eligible. But Rukmiṇi was so resolute that she would marry none but Kṛṣṇa and emboldened by this determination, she even sent a secret epistle to Kṛṣṇa, inviting him to come down at the appropriate moment and take her away some how, from those devils. Śrī Kṛṣṇa accordingly got hold of Rukmiṇi at the crucial moment, and drove her away openly. Śiśupāla and other kings, mustered by Rukman, who encountered Śrī Kṛṣṇa, were beaten off. The infuriated Rukmaṇ, however, pounced upon Kṛṣṇa, bent upon slaying Him and his life was spared by the Lord, at the special request of Rukimiṇi and, poor fellow, he was let off with mere disfigurement. (Śrīmad Bhāgavatam)




## 7.10.7
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நீள் நகரம் அதுவே மலர்ச் சோலைகள் சூழ் திருவாறன்விளை,  
நீள் நகரத்து உறைகின்ற பிரான் நெடுமால் கண்ணன் விண்ணவர்கோன்  
வாணபுரம் புக்கு முக்கண் பிரானைத் தொலைய வெம் போர்கள் செய்து.,  
வாணனை ஆயிரம் தோள் துணித்தான் சரண் அன்றி மற்று ஒன்று இலமே.

vāṇaṉai āyiram tōḷ tuṇittāṉ caraṇ aṉṟi maṟṟu oṉṟu ilamē.

**English translation of verse 7.10.7:**

Tiruvāṟaṉviḷai, the citadel huge, abounding in flower gardens,  
Is our destination and our Sole Refuge is the Benefactor great,  
Of love unlimited, Who lovingly resides there, Chief of the denizens  
Of Heaven, Lord Kaṇṇaṉ, Who Vāṇaṉ’s thousand arms did smite,  
Waging the battle fierce in his citadel, putting the tripled Rudra askance.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The Āḻvār considers this pilgrim centre, as his ultimate destination, even the High Heavens being relegated to a lower status and the Lord enshrined here, who vanquished the formidable foes, as his Sole Refuge. For details of Lord Kṛṣṇa’s encounter with Bāṇāsura and his great allies, see notes under III-10-4.

\(ii\) No doubt, the heaven is the land of eternal bliss, the land whence there is no returning. And yet, Tiruvāṟanviḷai is so enchanting that even the Lord looks upon it on a par with heaven.




## 7.10.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அன்றி மற்று ஒன்று இலம் நின்சரணே! என்று அகல் இரும் பொய்கையின்வாய்,  
நின்று தன் நீள் கழல் ஏத்திய ஆனையின் நெஞ்சு இடர் தீர்த்த பிரான்,  
சென்று அங்கு இனிது உறைகின்ற செழும் பொழில் சூழ் திருவாறன்விளை,  
ஒன்றி வலஞ்செய்ய ஒன்றுமோ? தீவினை உள்ளத்தின் சார்வு அல்லவே.

aṉṟi maṟṟu oṉṟu ilam niṉcaraṇē! eṉṟu akal irum poykaiyiṉvāy,

oṉṟi valañceyya oṉṟumō? tīviṉai uḷḷattiṉ cārvu allavē.

**English translation of verse 7.10.8:**

Were it possible to visit and go round  
Tiruvāṟaṇviḷai, by lovely gardens surrounded.  
Where lovingly resides the Lord, Who the deep distress relieved  
Of the Elephant in the pond huge, who his faith did pin  
On His lovely feet, squeeze we can from our hearts all sins.

**Notes:**

The Lord, who rid Gajendra, the pious elephant, of dire distress, and now stays in Tiruvāṟaṉviḷai, will certainly cure us of all ills and evils. With its leg right in the jaws of the tough crocodile, the elephant was engaged in a titanic struggle for years, trying to extricate himself from the monster. When this self-effort, grim and long, proved not only abortive but turned out to be a hindrance to the influx of the Lord’s grace, the great devotee that the elephant was, he looked upon the Lord as the Sole Saviour and deliverance followed. The elephant was not in the least bothered about its own emaciation and eventual dissolution but its sole concern was to offer the lotus flower plucked by it, at such a heavy cost and still held in its trunk, at the feet of the Supreme Lord. What distressed the elephant even more, was his deep concern that the Lord’s reputation as the Sole Saviour should not get tarnished by His not coming down to his rescue. It is precisely this, that has been referred to in this song, as the deep distress of the elephant. And so, the Lord feels benefited by the elephant, helping Him to redeem His reputation as the Sole Saviour of His subjects. This great trait of Lord Mahāviṣṇu of identifying Himself as the recipient of a favour when He is actually conferring one on His devotees and feeling distressed over the miseries of His subjects even more than they do, is inherited by His devotees. A true Vaiṣṇava (a votary of Lord Viṣṇu) is, therefore, one who possessed this remarkable trait.




## 7.10.9
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

தீவினை உள்ளத்தின் சார்வு அல்ல ஆகி தெளி விசும்பு ஏறலுற்றால்,  
நாவினுள்ளும் உள்ளத்துள்ளும் அமைந்த தொழிலினுள்ளும் நவின்று,  
யாவரும் வந்து வணங்கும் பொழில் திருவாறன்விளை அதனை,  
மேவி வலஞ்செய்து கைதொழக் கூடும்கொல் என்னும் என் சிந்தனையே.

yāvarum vantu vaṇaṅkum poḻil tiruvāṟaṉviḷai ataṉai,  
mēvi valañceytu kaitoḻak kūṭumkol eṉṉum eṉ cintaṉaiyē.

**English translation of verse 7.10.9:**

With a mind thoroughly cleansed, rid of all sins,  
I could perhaps reach Heaven and yet, in my thoughts do I pine  
For lovely Tiruvāṟaṉviḷai where the pious with thorough discipline  
Of word, deed and thought congregate and worship; I wish I would remain  
In that holy centre, circumambulate and worship with joined palms.

**Notes:**

The Āḻvār’s desire to reach this pilgrim centre is so great that even the high Heaven recedes to the background. Therefore, his thoughts are wholly centred on whether he would at all be able to reach that centre, stay firmly there and go round the place with great piety. Not only that, he feels that this holy centre is so very enchanting that is is bound to attract even the denizens of Heaven.




## 7.10.10
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

சிந்தை மற்றொன்றின் திறத்தது அல்லாத்தன்மை தேவபிரான் அறியும்,  
சிந்தையினால் செய்வ தான் அறியாதன மாயங்கள் ஒன்றும் இல்லை,  
சிந்தையினால் சொல்லினால் செய்கையால் நிலத்தேவர் குழுவணங்கும்,  
சிந்தை மகிழ் திருவாறன்விளை உறை தீர்த்தனுக்கு அற்ற பின்னே.

cintai maṟṟoṉṟiṉ tiṟattatu allāttaṉmai tēvapirāṉ aṟiyum,

cintaiyiṉāl colliṉāl ceykaiyāl nilattēvar kuḻuvaṇaṅkum,  
cintai makiḻ tiruvāṟaṉviḷai uṟai tīrttaṉukku aṟṟa piṉṉē.

**English translation of verse 7.10.10:**

There’s hardly a thought that crosses one’s mind,  
The omniscient Lord cannot comprehend;  
Surely, He knows that I think not of aught  
But the Lord immaculate. Who remains enshrined  
In Tiruvāṟaṉviḷai, that exilaṛates one’s heart.  
Worshipped by the devout thro’ word, deed and thought.

**Notes:**

This song provides the reply to the question supposed to have been put to him as to what he would do in case the Lord forced him into Heaven, which he had been demanding from Him quite often before. The Lord, being all-knowing, He is well aware that the Āḻvār’s mind now stands rivetted to Tiruvāṟaṉviḷai which has taken precedence over everything else, including the Heaven. Further, He is known to grant the boon prayed for by the subject, (Purusārta). That being the case, there is absolutely no risk of the Lord granting him anything other than that desired by him, even Heaven falling in the excluded category in this particular context. It is noteworthy that the Āḻvār does not even mouth the word. ‘Heaven’ and says, in general terms, that he does not think of anything else but the holy centre of Tiruvāṟaṉviḷai.




## 7.10.11
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

தீர்த்தனுக்கு அற்றபின் மற்று ஓர் சரண் இல்லை என்று எண்ணி தீர்த்தனுக்கே  
தீர்த்த மனத்தனன் ஆகி செழுங் குருகூர்ச் சடகோபன் சொன்ன,  
தீர்த்தங்கள் ஆயிரத்துள் இவை பத்தும் வல்லார்களைத், தேவர் வைகல்  
தீர்த்தங்களே என்று பூசித்து நல்கி உரைப்பர் தம் தேவியர்க்கே. (2)

**English translation of verse 7.10.11:**

Unto their spouses shall ever say the Celestials in Heaven,  
That those well-versed in these songs ten  
Out of the immaculate thousand of Kurukūr Caṭakōpaṉ,  
Dedicated to the immaculate Lord, as the sole Means  
Are indeed very pure, entitled to great reverence.

**Notes:**

\(i\) It has been given out here, as the benefit accruing to those chanting this decad, that the Eternal Heroes (Nitya Sūrīs), in Heaven, shall honour them a great deal and refer to them as of great sanctity, while talking to their spouses at the height of their joy born of their blemishless service unto Lord Vaikuṇṭanātha (the transcendent Lord in Heaven, in His ‘Para’ aspect). It is then that they feel inclined to divulge the secrets to their dear ones, even as the redoubted saint Rāmānuja divulged to those, eagerly assembled in front, the purport of the ‘Carama Śloka’, notwithstanding the oath of secrecy administered to him by his master, Goṣṭipūrṇar. Garuḍa has two wives, by name, Rudrā and Sukīrti while the wife of Śenāpathi (Cēṉai Mutaliyār) is Sūtravati. These pre-eminent ‘Nityās’ would always speak in superlative terms about the chanters of this decad.

\(ii\) *The Lord immaculate*: Himself of impeccable purity, He is also the great Sanctifier, Who renders His votaries also absolutely pure. River Gaṅgā got sanctified by the touch of His feet and Śiva, in turn, got sanctified by holding Gangā on his matted locks.

\(iii\) *Immaculate thousand*: All the songs in this great hymnal are like unto as many sacred waters.




## Retrospective Summary
(7-1): *In the opening decad*, the Āḻvār follows up the trend of thought, as in VI-9-9, where he dreaded the mischief of the senses and the frightful possibility of his going astray in the event of the prolongation of his stay in this abode. If the Āḻvār dreads in this manner, despite his having taken a deep plunge into the ocean of divine consciousness, it is because this land is notorious for its corrupting influence, bringing within its dirty pale even the ‘Nitya Sūrīs’, the proximate attendants of the Lord in Heaven, should they *ever happen* to step on to this soil;

(7-2): The Āḻvār, whose stay in this abode is being pṛolongued by the Lord, despite his protestation, is once again (figuratively) transformed as the Nāyakī (Mistress), weighed down by melancholy too deep for words. The critical condition of the Nāyakī and her various moods are narrated *in the second decad* by the gnostic mother to Lord Raṅganātha, enshrined in Śrīraṅgam (Tamil Nadu), bending over her daughter, right in the Sanctum. The mother enquires of the Lord, the Sole Saviour, as to what His intentions are and how exactly He would like to deal with her love-lorn daughter. This decad, however, ends on a happy note, the mother being mighty glad that her daughter has, after all, attained the benign feet of Lord Raṅganātha;

(7-3): The bliss of the union of the Nāyakī and Lord Raṅganātha having overflown its continents, the Lord hits upon a method whereby the God-enjoyment of the Nāyakī could be stabilised, instead of her being swept off by it. The Lord goes to Teṉtiruppēreyil (near the Āḻvār’s birth place) on a hunting expedition, by way of relieving the distress of the people over there from the depredations of wild animals. Although the Nāyakī herself equipped Him with weapons and bid Him farewell, wishing Him success, yet she is all agog to go there herself, unable to brook separation from her Lord even for a short while. *In the third decad*, we see the Nāyakī insisting that she shall go, in the face of stiff opposition from her mother, mates and other kinsfolk. At best, she would allow them to escort her and leave her with the Lord, even if they cannot allow her to go alone;

(7-4): Just when the Nāyakī was attempting to go to Tiruppēreyil where the Lord had gone for game-hunting, he returned victorious. Exceedingly jubilant over the Lord’s quick return from the victorious expedition, Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī gets locked up in His sweet embrace, by way of relieving His fatigue (mental experience of course). In his current festive mood, the Āḻvār recounts *in the fourth decad* the Lord’s wondrous deeds and benefaction, vast and varied, exclaiming, “What a marvel!” “What a wonder!” and so on.

(7-5): *In the fifth decad*, the Āḻvār cites some more achievements of the Lord, much to his own delectation. At the same time, he could not help wondering how the worldlings whose birthright it is to share this enjoyment. kept aloof from God and he even felt vexed with them for their callous indifference to Him, in the face of His numerous deeds, good and great, bringing to the fore His benevolent dispensations and loving condescension, (Although it is all worded in the third person, this decad is indeed yet another address of the Āḻvār to the *wordly me*).

(7-6): Despite his enormous yearning, of unimaginable depth, the Āḻvār has not been able to experience the bliss of lasting communion with the Lord. Alternating between ravishing joy and deep dejection, as seen all along, the Āḻvār, in his present disconsolate state laments loudly, *in the sixth decad*, so as to melt even the stony hearts of the ungodly. In the first two songs of this decad, the Lord has been set out as the goal, the next five songs reveal Him as also the ‘Means’ for attaining Him while the three following songs highlight Him as the Great Redeemer, destroying the ungodly and salving the devout through His voluntary grace, cutting out all their impediments (sins).

(V1I-7): In response to the soul-stirring utterances of the Āḻvār, as in the sixth decad, the Lord enabled him to comprehend (mentally of course) His exquisite Form, limb by limb. Led away by the Lord’s charming beauty, the Āḻvār aims at external perception and physical enjoyment of the Lord’s enchanting Form, with outstretched hands but feels frustrated, when the experience longed for, is denied to him. The Āḻvār, once again transformed (figuratively) as Nāyakī, hits back the prodding mates and elders, overwhelmed by the Lord’s bewitching beauty. But it is a note of stinging regret that runs through the *entire seventh decad* as the Nāyaki could not envision the Lord’s Form as a whole, but perceive only one limb at a time, whetting her appetite all the more for the enjoyment of the Lord’s Form, in its entirety;

(7-8): Cut out from the worldly moorings and with God-love welling up his boson, by leaps and bounds, the Āḻvār craves for immediate union with the Lord. So great is the Āḻvār’s ardour that non-realisation of his inordinate longing should have normally resulted in his collapse and extinction. It is, therefore, a matter of great wonder for him that he is still kept alive in this narrowing abode, with all its susceptibilities. When asked by him to elucidate this wonder wrought by the Lord, he exhibits unto the Āḻvār, many more wonders—His kaleidoscopic cosmic wealth. Thereupon, the Āḻvār voices forth *in the eighth decad* his mental reactions to the wonderful phenomena in front of him, besides seeking clarification from the Lord, in regard to the many bewildering complexities, baffling intellectual *comprehension*;

(7-9): Perplexed over the prolongation of his stay in this cussed land with its sordid surroundings, the Āḻvār elicits from the Lord his intention tn this regard. The Āḻvār is informed that he has been kept in this abode in order to get from him, the soul-stirring hymns of unparalleled sweetness, for the edification and enjoyment of Himself and His devotees. Overawed by the Lord’s tender solicitude and loving condescension, in choosing him for this assignment, in preference to the eminent sages like Vyāsa, Parāśara and Vālmīki and the sweet singing divine bards, *par excellence*, the first three Āḻvārs, the Āḻvār gratefully acknowledges *in the ninth decad* the Lord’s great gesture, perplexed a great deal over his inability to recompense the Lord, A there was hardly anything he could call his own;

(7-10): The Lord has indeed chosen an enchanting place, namely, Tiruvāṟaṉviḷai (Kerala State) from where He and His dear Consort (Mahālakṣmī) could enjoy listening to Tiruvāymoḻi recital by Saint Nammāḻvār. The Āḻvār, whom we saw, in the ninth decad, remaining perplexed over his inability to recompense the Lord for the extraordinary grace shed by Him, was, therefore, given a chance to fulfil his heart’s desire, by singing this great hymnal unto Him and His Consort, in that holy centre, much to Their dictation.—And so, *in the concluding decad of this Centum*, the Āḻvār attempts to render the service graciously assigned to him by the Lord. So great is his desire to reach this fascinating pilgrim centre, looking upon it as his ultimate destination, relegating even the high Heaven to the background.
