## 00 Intro10.2
In this decad, the Āḻvār lauds the glory of the Lord, in His worshippable form at Tiruvaṉantapuram (in Kerala State). As we go on, we will find the Āḻvār calling successively at the holy centres of Tiruvāṭṭāṟu, Tirumāliruñcōlai, Tiruppēr and adoring the Lord enshrined in those places. A similar treatment is noticeable in the case of Tirumaṅkai Āḻvār also. He is found calling on the Lords of many holy places, all of them in a single decad of the tenth Centum (X-l) of his grand apocalypse (Periya Tirumoḻi). When asked by Nañcīyar to elucidate this visiting spree on the part of that Āḻvār, Bhaṭṭārya brought home the import, in a very telling manner. He said: “Don’t you know, Son, when a girl is given in marriage, there comes a time when she has to leave her parental roof for that of her husband and that it is but natural that she then goes about visiting her relations and friends at this end, to take leave of them. So does the Āḻvār, as the time for departing to Heaven draws near; on the eve of his departure from this abode, he takes leave of the Lord in His worshippable form, at the various shrines over here, who did, as a matter of fact, instil and enrich his love for God in Heaven.”

Having been assured of his ascent to Heaven at the end of the current span of life, (9-10-5), Saint Nammāḻvār quite well knew that the day of his ascent was near at hand. And that is why he has actively embarked on a programme of leave-taking.




## 10.2.1
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

**English translation of verse 10.2.1:**

Right this day shall we enter holy Aṉantapuram  
In whose ponds and ḷḷelds fertile do merry bees hum.  
Where the Lord reposes lovingly on His serpent-bed;  
Your entry into the holy city, Yama’s agents dare not impede,  
Though they are known to torment continually; if we do but utter  
The holy name, ‘Kēcava’, all our sins shall forthwith disappear.

**Notes:**

\(i\) There could possibly be quite a few things, standing in the way of one’s entry into the holy city of Aṉantapuram, (Tiruvaṉantapuram, the capital of Kerala State) which the Āḻvār now longs to laud and enjoy. But then, the Lord’s names are handy enough to dispel the sins of the chanters of these names and thus remove all the impediments in the way of their achieving the desired objective. Among the several meanings, conveyed by the holy name ‘Keśava’, the one which would be most apt in the present context, is: the destroyer of the horse-shaped fiend, named Keśi, set up by King Kaṃsa to kill Kṛṣṇa, the Divine Child. ‘Keśi’, the demon, typifies enemies in general and the mere mention of the name of the Lord, denoting His destruction of just one enemy, that is, Keśi, is enough to destroy all our enemies, that is all our sins, that stand between us and the Lord. Did not the single offender (Rāvaṇa) bring on the destruction of his entire race? It needn’t, for a moment, be doubted whether the sins already committed could at all be wiped off, in this manner, without the sinners getting into the clutches of Yama's hordes, determined to put the former through the tortures of hell. Well, here is the magic,, namely, spelling the word “Keśava”, which at once keeps Yama’s agents out of bounds and there is no question of their coming anywhere near us. Here is a single remedy, the panacea for all ills and evils, unlike the scriptural prescription of different methods of atonement of different types of sins.

\(ii\) Yama is, no doubt, the agent appointed by God for punishing the law-breakers, the laws being the Śāstras, with their decrees and injunctions. But those, who are engaged in the service of the Lord in His worshippable form, wrapt in ecstatic contemplation of the Lord exquisitely manifest in His image, will certainly be out of the purview of Yama’s punishment, if they departed from the punctual and rigid observance of the Śāstraic routine. This was clearly elucidated by the illustrious Bhaṭṭārya. one evening when Lord Raṅganātha was moving by the river-side, during one of the annual festivals, entailing excursions outside the holy city of Araṅkam. When a few of the Brahmin attendants expressed their intention to retire for performing the evening prayer (Sandhyāvandhana), Bhaṭṭārya observed:

“Brothers, in our present occupation, namely, absorbing attention to our Sovereign Lord Himself, of exquisite charm, visibly present here, if we skip the religious routine, just this evening, know that we are occupied with the Law-Giver Himself. Surely, Yama will not construe this as a transgression and accuse us as lawbreakers, liable for punishment. Supposing a king holds court to hear reports of the financial working of the various departments of his kingdom and, in the course of hearing, adverse mention is made of a favourite of the king. If the king orders the reporter to skip over that particular item and pass on to the next, will the reporter thenceforward dare to revert to that item, deliberately skipped over by the king, and point the accusing finger at the king’s favourite? When we are here, busy with the king directly, what other business can draw us away from Him? All ordinary law is set aside before the Lord Who is the highest Law Himself”.




## 10.2.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

இன்றுபோய்ப் புகுதிராகில் எழுமையும் ஏதம்சாரா  
குன்றுநேர் மாடம்மாடே குருந்துசேர் செருந்திபுன்னை  
மன்றலர் பொழில் அனந்தபுரநகர் மாயன்நாமம்

maṉṟalar poḻil aṉantapuranakar māyaṉnāmam  
oṉṟumōr āyiramām uḷḷuvārkku umparūrē

**English translation of verse 10.2.2:**

Sins shall not get near you for generations,  
If You’d this day get into Aṉantapuram with gardens fine,  
Holding stately trees and castles tall, rising like mountains;  
A single name of the Lord, enshrined there, is as potent  
As a thousand names and for those, who that name do chant,  
That holy Centre becomes the very Heaven indeed.

**Notes:**

\(i\) “The name of the Lord at Aṉantapuram shall by itself extend unto you protection, on all fronts. If you’d only get into that holy centre, sins shall not come near you, not only now but in all successive births”, this is how the Āḻvār exhorts the people around. The mere mention of the name of the Lord, enshrined there, will transform that place into Heaven. Yet another way of interpreting the text of this song is that one need not even go to Aṉantapuram, as such, but one is assured of heavenly ascent, by merely spelling out the name of the Lord enshrined there, a name that is potent enough to fulfil the functions of the other names, as well.

\(ii\) “*Castles rising like mountains*”—Unlike the ordinary run of man-kind, given to hurrying, those soaked in God-love move about leisurely, enjoying the sight of the high mansions, turrets and towers lining the streets of pilgrim centres, drinking them in, as it were, with their eyes, in rapturous admiration.




## 10.2.3
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஊரும்புள் கொடியும் அஃதே உலகுஎல்லாம் உண்டுஉமிழ்ந்தான்  
சேரும் தண்அனந்தபுரம் சிக்கெனப் புகுதிராகில்

**English translation of verse 10.2.3:**

If You’d only reach Aṉantapuram, cool and lovely, with a mind firm,  
Where dwells our Lord Who has Garuḍa as His vehicle  
And banner too, Who once ate up the worlds, one and all,  
And then spat them out, let me unto you affirm,  
You will be rid of all your ills and evils,  
Better utter any one of His thousand names.

**Notes:**

“Any one of the Lord’s thousand (innumerable) names is potent enough to destroy all evils. So then, chant but one such name and get rid of all your sins”, exhorts the Āḻvār. The votaries are asked to enter the holy city of Aṉantapuram with firm determination and get their sins destroyed. On reaching the place, no difficult task is set unto them by the Āḻvār; they are required to do nothing more than chant just one of the many holy names of the Lord, the great Deliverer.




## 10.2.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

பேசுமின் கூசம்இன்றி பெரியநீர் வேலைசூழ்ந்து  
வாசமே கமழும் சோலை வயலணிஅனந்தபுரம்  
நேசம்செய்து உறைகின்றானை நெறிமையால் மலர்கள்தூவி  
பூசனை செய்கின்றார்கள் புண்ணியம் செய்தவாறே.

pēcumiṉ kūcamiṉṟi periyanīr vēlaicūḻntu

nēcamceytu uṟaikiṉṟāṉai neṟimaiyāl malarkaḷtūvi  
pūcaṉai ceykiṉṟārkaḷ puṇṇiyam ceytavāṟē.

**English translation of verse 10.2.4:**

Speak out, with no mental reserve,  
What indeed is the penance performed  
By those that worship, with choice flowers,  
The Lord, who delightfully dwells in Aṉantapuram, well adorned  
By fields fertile and gardens full of fragrance sweet  
And surrounded by the oceanic waters vast.

**Notes:**

The Āḻvār extols those that have the good fortune to worship the Lord at Tiruvaṉantapuram whose gardens are so full of fragrance that it more than offsets the possible stench of the sea around. It is by-no-means surprising that the denizens of the High Heavens, marked by spotless purity and overwhelming devotion to the Lord, worship Him there, in that transcendent setting, with punctilious care and attention. It would, however, be most surprising, rather praiseworthy, if, in this land of dark nescience, quite a few resorted to the worship of the Lord, like unto lotus blooming in the hearth, fed by fire to the brim.




## 10.2.5
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

புண்ணியம் செய்து நல்ல புனலொடு மலர்கள்தூவி  
எண்ணுமின் எந்தைநாமம் இப்பிறப்புஅறுக்கும் அப்பால்  
திண்ணம்நாம் அறியச்சொன்னோம் செறிபொழில் அனந்தபுரத்து  
அண்ணலார் கமலபாதம் அணுகுவார் அமரர்ஆவார்

puṇṇiyam ceytu nalla puṉaloṭu malarkaḷtūvi  
eṇṇumiṉ entaināmam ippiṟappuaṟukkum appāl  
tiṇṇamnām aṟiyaccoṉṉōm ceṟipoḻil aṉantapurattu  
aṇṇalār kamalapātam aṇukuvār amararāvār

**English translation of verse 10.2.5:**

Meditate on the holy names of our Lord  
And unto Him offer with devotion supreme,  
Water, pure and simple, and flowers fine, to get rid  
Of this fell bondage of Saṃsāra; let me affirm,  
Those that get near the lotus feet of our Sire  
At Aṉantapuram, with many a garden fine,  
Are as good as the Eternal Angels in Heaven.

**Notes:**

The Āḻvār exhorts the people to approach the Lord at Aṉantapuram and adore His lotus feet, affirming that, by so doing, they will rise to the stature of the ‘Nitya Sūrīs’ in Heaven. By sacramental water for the Lord’s worship is meant only water, pure and simple, and not the one spiced and flavoured with cloves and cardamoms, the emphasis being on the easy worshippability of the Lord. Mere meditation on the holy names of the Lord will grind to a halt the dreadful cycle of birth and death. There is also no restriction whatsoever, in regard to the persons eligible to indulge in meditation. All that is needed is the mere desire to spell out the Lord’s holy names. There is scarcely a felicity which the recital of the holy names does not confer and he, who seeks separate means to enable him to recite the Lord’s names, is as ludicrous as the one attempting to cleanse himself in a petty pool of brackish water, preparatory to having a dip in the holy Ganga, as the illustrious Bhaṭṭārya would put it. When a man stumbles on the road, at once he cries out “Ammā!” To cry so, is any qualification needed? No; even so, no special qualification is needed to recite the Lord’s holy names.




## 10.2.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அமரராய்த் திரிகின்றார்கட்கு ஆதிசேர் அனந்தபுரத்து  
அமரர்கோன் அர்ச்சிக்கின்று அங்குஅகப்பணி செய்வர் விண்ணோர்  
நமர்களோ! சொல்லக்கேள்மின் நாமும்போய் நணுகவேண்டும்

amararkōṉ arccikkiṉṟu aṅkuakappaṇi ceyvar viṇṇōr  
namarkaḷō! collakkēḷmiṉ nāmumpōy naṇukavēṇṭum  
kumaraṉār tātai tuṉpam tuṭaitta kōvintaṉārē

**English translation of verse 10.2.6:**

Worship the Lord, Who the distress did dispel  
Of Kumaraṉ's sire, Chief of the Immortals chuckling with pride,  
Who in holy Aṉantapuram does lovingly dwell,  
Sēṉāpathi Āḻvāṉ, as the head of the Celestials, does lead  
And him others from Heaven do ably support;  
Ye, my men, listen to what f state,  
We too shall that holy band join and adore the Lord.

**Notes:**

\(i\) Holy Aṉantapuram is to be coveted even more than Heaven, inasmuch as the former attracts even the exalted denizens of Heaven who move down from those dizzy heights and serve the Lord enshrined here. Here then is a pilgrim centre, where parity is enjoyed by the ‘Nitya Sūrīs’ of Heaven and the ‘Nitya Samsārīs’, down here. The Lord’s face, navel and feet are seen through three separate doors of the Sanctum, catering to three different categories of worshippers, namely, (1) the band of Celestials headed by Sēṉāpathi Āḻvāṉ to whom the Lord reveals His face through the doorway at one end, (2) Brahmā and other Devas who catch sight of the Lord’s navel region through the passage in the middle and (3) people of this world, who worship the Lord’s lovely pair of feet through the doorway at the other end. vide aphorism 183 of ‘Ācārya Hṛdayam’. As a matter of fact, Sēṉāpathi Āḻvāṉ, who has been assigned the portfolio of administration of the Universe, has to necessarily look at the Lord’s face and obtain His approval for the proposals submitted by him, either by word of mouth or merely by His gestures and looks. Again, Brahmā, who emerged from the Lord’s navel, sees the Lord’s navel region at Aṉantapuram through the middle gate. We, worldlings, seeking refuge at the Lord’s feet, see His feet through the end-gate.

\(ii\) Surely, the Lord, Who dispels the distress of even Śiva, the father of Subrahmaṇya and the other Devas, full of egotism, will certainly deliver us, the selfless lovers.




## 10.2.7
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

துடைத்த கோவிந்தனாரே உலகுஉயிர் தேவும்மற்றும்  
படைத்த எம்பரமமூர்த்தி பாம்பணைப் பள்ளிகொண்டான்

maṭaittalai vāḷaipāyum vayalaṇiaṉantapuram  
kaṭaittalai cīykkappeṟṟāl kaṭuviṉai kaḷaiyalāmē

**English translation of verse 10.2.7:**

Your deadly sins will get dissolved if you’d resort  
To Aṉantapuram. which fields fertile do adorn,  
And clean up the door-step of the temple where reclines  
On serpent-bed, the Lord Supreme who dissolved the worlds  
And then put them back into the respective folds.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The Āḻvār affirms that those, who render service unto the Lord reclining at Tiru-Aṉantapuram, will get rid of their age-long sins, however deadly they might be. Of the several kinds of service, prominence is given to cleaning up the temple gates and keeping the temple front, bright and tidy.

\(ii\) The wiping off of the worlds, that is, the Lord’s act of dissolution or destruction of the Sportive Universe, ‘Līlā Vibhūti’ is mentioned first and then the creation. This is because Vedāntas speak of dissolution first. As a matter of fact, the ‘Saṃsāra’ or the cycle of birth and rebirth is much-too-old and its beginning is just not known. The dissolution is but eating up all the worlds, with their contents and sustaining them all, inside the Lord’s stomach, from being swept off by the whirling waters of the Deluge. Creation is but spitting them out, at the end of the Deluge and putting things back in their respective folds.




## 10.2.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கடுவினை களையலாகும் காமனைப் பயந்தகாளை

**English translation of verse 10.2.8:**

Go and behold, my men! the lovely pair of feet of our Lord,  
The mighty Sire of Kāman, Who has pretty Ānantapuram as His abode,  
Who does on a Cobra with many a hood recline;  
That you may be rid of your deadly sins,  
I do, unto you all, make this known.

**Notes:**

\(i\) Saint Nammāḻvār exhorts the pious Vaiṣṇavas around, to proceed to holy Aṉantapuram and behold the lovely feet of the Lord, reclining there on serpent-couch. The form, this exhortation assumes, is noteworthy; even as people are proceeding towards the holy centre, their deadly sins fall off, this is how the Āḻvār puts it.

\(ii\) Here is an interesting anecdote; Maṇakkāl Nampi, the preceptor of Āḷavantār (Yāmunācārya) had taught the distinguished disciple all but Yoga Śastra, which was deliberately left over, to be taught by a great Yogi, by name Kurukaikkāvalappaṉ. When Āḷavantār approached the Yogi in question for learning from him the Yogic secrets, the latter fixed up a date on which Āḷavantār was to meet the preceptor again and start receiving instructions in Yoga. The appointed date was duly noted in a small scrap of paper and it was kept by Āḷavantār in safe custody. But then, the ‘Tirumoḷi’ and ‘Tiruvāymoḻi’ festivals, each of ten days’ duration, went on at a stretch in Śrīraṅgam, with the special service of the Arayar, the temple minstrel, in the holy presence of Lord Raṅganātha. Āḻavantār was an active participant, being at the head of the distinguished gathering of listeners. When this particular song was recited with great emphasis by the Arayar, facing Āḻavantār, the latter reacted so well that he at once set out for Aṉantapuram along with his disciples. As Nampiḷḷai would put it, Āḷavantār reacted, as above, because that was the surest way of securing contact, rather, becoming associated with Nammāḻvār, within the meaning of the phrase “My men” (Namarkaḷ), occurring in this song. Well, one of those days, when he was staying in holy Aṉantapuram worshipping Lord Padmanābha, Āḷavantār recollected that he was to meet Kurukaikkāvalappaṉ, the Yoga instructor and looked up the chit, in his custody. It so happened that it was the very day on which he had to meet the Yogi and Āḷavantār heaved a sigh of grief, saying, “What a pity! I have not got a special vehicle to transport me just now!”




## 10.2.9
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நாம் உமக்கு அறியச்சொன்ன நாள்களும் நணியஆன

**English translation of verse 10.2.9:**

The days, I spoke to you about, are drawing near,  
Here’s Aṉantapuram, You see, with orchards fine, our haven safe,  
Do go there with choice flowers and incense pure  
For Lord Vāmana’s worship and meditate; Your sins will fall off  
By themselves, I am quite sure.

**Notes:**

The Āḻvār has already stated, vide IX-10-5, that he will reach the Heaven, the destined Land, at the end of the current span of life, as vouchsafed to him by the Lord at Tirukkaṇṇapuram. He now reverts to that and says that the crucial day of his departure from this world is drawing near and invites the worldlings to listen to his advice and prosper. Once he departs from this world, who else is there to tender such wholesome advice and even if there be yet another, who will listen to him? This is precisely how Lord Kṛṣṇa advised Yudhiṣṭira to go and receive instructions in the intricacies of morality and ethical values, at the feet of Bhīṣmācār, who lay on his death-bed made up of arrows, awaiting the dawn of Uttarāyaṇa for giving up his mortal coil.

Lord Kṛṣṇa, though an Avatāra Himself, exhorted Yudhiṣṭira to learn all truths from Bhīsma. The Lord is Truth itself and yet. He would go unheard by the commonalty; at any rate, He may not be heard as well as they listen to the Truth-seers (Tatva Darśīs). That is why He told Arjuna, vide Bhagavad Gītā, IV-34, “By prostrations, by fair questioning and by reverential service to Truth-seeing Saints, learn, for they shall teach you wisdom”. As a matter of fact, all spiritual teaching has value only when it proceeds from recognised authority. One Pariñai Appar used to quote Parāśara Bhaṭṭar’s observation in this regard, as follows: “Unless the custodian of an article is a person of worth, the article loses value, both in the hands of the giver and the taker.”




## 10.2.10
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

**English translation of verse 10.2.10:**

All your sins will go off, on their own, when you utter  
The name ‘Mātavaṉ’; undying fame shall in them vest that offer  
With ardour great, fine sandal paste, lamp and incense and gather  
Lotus flowers nice, for the diurnal worship of the Lord  
At holy Aṉantapuram, the city bounded by walls of solid gold.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The name, ‘Mātavaṉ’, (Mādhava) denotes the Lord, in conjunction with Mahālakṣmī, the Divine Mother and it is but natural that all our miseries die off, when we ejaculate the Lord’s name, betokening this highly benevolent combination of our eternal Father and Mother.

\(ii\) Serving the Lord with due ceremonies and worshipping Him uninterruptedly, free from distractions, in the High Heavens, is by-no-means a matter of surprise, because that is the land of unalloyed bliss and beatitude, rid of all impediments to the continual meditation and worship of the Lord. Unlike the denizens of the High Heavens, who hold an unbroken rapport with the Lord, the inexhaustible fountain of bliss, here, in this land of darkness and nescience, with its numerous distractions, if there are at least some who procure, with great care and devotion, choice materials with which to worship the Lord in His worshippable Form, it is indeed a matter for great surprise; surely, these are men of undying fame, indeed.




## 10.2.11
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அந்தம்இல் புகழ் அனந்தபுர நகர் ஆதிதன்னைக்

**English translation of verse 10.2.11:**

Those that can recite these songs ten,  
Out of the thousand composed by Caṭakōpaṉ  
Of Kurukūr, with orchids fine, adoring the Lord of everlasting fame,  
Who has His abode in lovely Aṉantapuram,  
Shall attain Heaven at the end of the current span  
And there be entertained by the damsels fine  
With bamboo-like arms, bedecked with jewels nice.

**Notes:**

\(i\) In the preceding song, the Āḻvār extolled those who worship the Lord at Aṉantapuram, as men of undying fame; now, he is referring to the Lord as of undying fame. Ever as the pious men of this world have surpassed the fame of the denizens of Heaven, the Lord, in His worshippable Form in this abode, excels His own transcendent glory in the High Heaven. Whereas all those, in the high Heaven, have the true knowledge of their essential nature as the Lord’s exclusive vassals, totally dependent on Him, here, in this abode, there are myriads of men straying away from God, oblivious of their true relationship with Him. Does it not, therefore, redound to His great glory, right here, when He tries to wean away the errant mortals, gone astray? But for His tender solicitude and redemptive grace, these poor souls would be drifting farther and farther away from Him.

\(ii\) What is alluded to, in this end-song, as the benefit accruing from the recital of this decad, is not the sensual pleasure enjoyable by the chanters on their attaining Heaven through the ‘Apsaras’, the lovely damsels over there. Indeed, there is no touch of carnality, the skin-deep variety of entertainment, in that blissful land and the entertainment offered by these damsels who play host to the new-comers to Heaven, is the same as that referred to later in X-9-6, 7 and 10,
