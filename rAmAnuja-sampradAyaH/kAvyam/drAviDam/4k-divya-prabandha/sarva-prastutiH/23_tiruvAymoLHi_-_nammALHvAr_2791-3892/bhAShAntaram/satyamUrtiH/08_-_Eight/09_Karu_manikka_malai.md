## 00 Intro9.9
This decad is spelt out by a mate of Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī (Āḻvār, figuratively turned into a female lover). In the entire hymnal, there are three decads of this type and this is the last of the series, the two earlier ones being IV-6 and VI-5. In IV-6, the mate advised the elders, gathered around Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī, who were treading the mis-guided path of invoking minor deities to cure the Nāyakī’s malady, to desist from their wrong methods and smear the Nāyakī’s body with the dust from the feet of Śrī Vaiṣṇavas. In VI-5, it may be recalled, the mates pointed out to the elders, the futility of their trying to extricate the Nāyakī, completely absorbed in the Deity at Tolaivillimaṅkalam, having committed the initial mistake of taking her to that pilgrim centre and then brought her face to face with the Deity there.

The background of this decad is, as follows:

Seeing that Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī (Āḻvār) has come of marriageable age, the parents make known to the folks in the town their intention to get her married to an eligible bachelor. Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī is, however, fiercely steeped in the Supreme Lord. As a matter of fact, she has already had secret contacts with the Lord, enshrined in Kuṭṭanāṭṭu Tiruppuliyūr (Kerala State), of which her parents were not aware. The mate, who enjoys the Nāyakī’s confidence, however, knew about it from the change wrought in the Nāyakī’s person and the manner of her talking, but she was afraid of inviting the wrath of the elders upon herself, in case she publicised the truth about the Nāyakī. At the same time, if the truth was not revealed to the elders, they might go ahead with the unwholesome project of getting the Nāyakī married off locally to some one and embarrass poor Nāyakī who might keep reticent out of shyness. Caught thus, in the horns of a dilemma, the mate hits upon a via-media to tide over the situation. The mate makes it appear that she has just got to know about the Nāyaki’s affair with the Lord at Kuṭṭanāṭṭu. Tiruppuliyūr and points out to the elders that, in view of this development, it would no longer be feasible for them to pursue their former plans. This brings to the fore the Nāyakī’s inalienability from the Lord to whom she stands totally dedicated as the object of His exclusive enjoyment. Thus, the essential nature of the soul, as set out in the last decad, gets crystallised still further in this decad.

It deserves to be noted that, enlightened by the Lord about the soul’s grandeur as His vassal, highly delectable to Him, the Āḻvār is mighty jubilant, to the point of being turned into the feminine state (Nāyakī). The Āḻvār, thus transformed, highlights the current mood of the Nāyakī, her total dedication to the Lord as His exclusive vassal in the esoteric sense, adopting the theme as above. In fact, this is the solitary decad in the entire hymnal, where the Nāyakī gives vent to her joy, indirectly though. In all other decads reflecting the Nāyakī stance, she is in a state of extreme discomfiture due to the immediate non-fulfilment of her particular longing.

**Tamil text and transliteration:**

**English translation of verse 8.9.1:**

She utters not anything but the holy names  
Of the wondrous Lord, difficult to attain, Who remains  
In Kuṭṭanāṭṭu Tiruppuliyur, abounding in fields fertile,  
Like unto lush forests which with large lotus flowers bristle,  
Blooming over the crest of a mount of dark ruby, His lips lovely,  
Chest, eyes, hands, feet, navel and robes, being red, one and all;  
Ye, elders, I know not what I can do for her, at all.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The mate says that the Nāyakī cannot fix her mind on anything else, having been enthralled by the exquisite beauty of the Lord enshrined in Tiruppuliyūr in Kuṭṭanāṭu (present Kerala State) and she keeps on uttering His names alone. This pilgrim centre is one of the thirteen centres, sung by the Āḻvārs, in Kerala State. There is another pilgrim centre bearing the same name in the territory comprised in the former Cōlā Kingdom (now Tamil Nāḍu), called Cōla Nāṭṭu Tiruppuliyūr. The pilgrim centre covered by this decad, is, therefore, distinctly mentioned as Kuṭṭanāṭṭu Tiruppuliyūr.

\(ii\) There is nothing like a dark ruby, ruby being only red. And yet, the Āḻvār has used this expression, as poetic imagery, to project the picture of the Lord of bluish complexion, of generous dimensions, whose chest bearing the Divine Mother (Mahālakṣmī), lips, hands, navel, feet and silken robes are all red. This exquisite charm would indeed be beyond the purview of our enjoyment but for His coming and staying in ‘Arca’ (iconic) manifestation, out of condescending love, induced by Mahālakṣmī, the Divine Consort.




## 8.9.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அன்னைமீர் இதற்கு என்செய்கேன்? அணிமேருவின் மீதுஉலவும்  
துன்னுசூழ் சுடர் ஞாயிறும் அன்றியும் பல்சுடர்களும்போல்

miṉṉu nīḷmuṭiāram palkalaṉ tāṉuṭai emperumāṉ  
puṉṉaiam poḻilcūḻ tiruppuliyūr pukaḻumivaḷē.

**English translation of verse 8.9.2:**

Ye, elders, What can I do, if this lady stands lost in admiration  
Of Tiruppuliyūr, abounding in lovely gardens, where remains  
The Lord with the crown resplendent, garland and jewels many  
Beaming like the glorious sun that on lovely mount Mēru rises  
And the grand galaxy of stars luminous?

**Notes:**

The mate goes on repeating, “what can I do for this lady’s condition?” just to impress upon the elders that she was not a party to this involvement of the Nāyakī and that it was a sudden development, of which neither she nor they had any inkling. Besides uttering the Lord’s holy names, the Nāyakī is said to be all praises for Tiruppuliyūr which abounds in fertile fields and lovely gardens. She could also describe in detail, the Lord’s beaming person, His crown, garland and jewels shining like the grand assembly of all luminous bodies; surely, this throws sufficient light on her intimate contact with the Deity over there.




## 8.9.3
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

புகழும் இவள்நின்று இராப்பகல் பொருநீர்க்கடல் தீப்பட்டு எங்கும்  
திகழும்எரியொடு செல்வதுஒப்ப செழும்கதிர்ஆழிமுதல்  
புகழும் பொருபடை ஏந்தி போர்புக்கு அசுரரைப் பொன்றுவித்தான்

pukaḻum porupaṭai ēnti pōrpukku acuraraip poṉṟuvittāṉ  
tikaḻum maṇineṭu māṭamnīṭu tiruppuliyūr vaḷamē.

**English translation of verse 8.9.3:**

This lady keeps praising the grandeur, day and night,  
Of Tiruppuliyūr, where stand castles tall in lustrous array,  
And stays the Lord wielding lovely weapons such as the discus bright.  
Who to battle went, like the surging sea set ablaze,  
Moving along with flames around, and did the Asuras rout.

**Notes:**

Here is another grand poetic imagery, the Lord of bluish tint entering the battlefield, wielding the dazzling discus and other weapons of rare excellence, being likened to the blue sea set ablaze, moving about with flames all around. Even as Sītā locked herself up in the sweet embrace of the great warrior, Śrī Rāma, the Vīra Rāghava Who stood victorious in front of her, after vanquishing, single-handed, the entire horde of Rākṣasas in [janaṣāna][?], numbering as many as fourteen thousand, in an amazingly short period, Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī is now all admiration for the warrior in Tiruppuliyūr and keeps on recounting His great prowess. This gives yet another clue to the mate about the Nāyakī’s engrossment with that Deity. Even as Sītā lavished all her affections on Ayodhyā, in preference to Mithila, her birthplace, the Āḻvār is all praises for Tiruppuliyūr, giving Tirunakari, his birthplace the go-by.




## 8.9.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஊர்வளம்கிளர் சோலையும் கரும்பும் பெரும்செந்நெலும் சூழ்ந்து  
ஏர்வளம்கிளர் தண்பணைக் குட்டநாட்டுத் திருப்புலியூர்  
சீர்வளம்கிளர் மூவுலகுஉண்டுஉமிழ் தேவபிரான்

cīrvaḷamkiḷar mūvulakuuṇṭuumiḻ tēvapirāṉ  
pērvaḷamkiḷarntaṉṟip pēccuilaḷ iṉṟu ippuṉaiiḻaiyē.

**English translation of verse 8.9.4:**

This dame with jewels bedecked, these days,  
Recounts, with no respite, the holy names,  
That bespeak the glory great of the Lord Who gulped down,  
And spat the worlds three, Who stays,  
In Kuṭṭanāṭṭu Tiruppuliyūr, full of lovely gardens,  
And rich crops of sugarcane and paddy, amid fields fertile.

**Notes:**

Lost in admiration of the enchanting environments of Tiruppuliyūr, the Nāyakī goes on describing its fauna and flora, the rich fields with extensive cultivation and all that with great delight. And then, she goes into raptures over the role of the Deity there, as the great Protector of the entire universe and talks about it, days on end, in a manner very much out of the ordinary run. As she speaks on with great zest, she brightens up and looks exceedingly charming, as if she is bedecked with jewels. The mate is led to conclude from the Nāyakī’s speech and comportment that she has had contacts with the Deity at Tiruppuliyūr.




## 8.9.5
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

புனைஇழைகள் அணிவும் ஆடைஉடையும் புதுக்கணிப்பும்

சுனையினுள் தடம்தாமரை மலரும் தண் திருப்புலியூர்

muṉaivaṉ mūvulakuāḷi appaṉ tiruaruḷ mūḻkiṉaḷē.

**English translation of verse 8.9.5:**

The way this lady bedecks herself and dresses up  
And the amorous glow on her if one pauses to look up,  
One can discern,’ tis beyond comprehension [in terms earthly],  
Bathed she must have been in the grace lovely,  
Of the Sovereign Master of all the worlds, reigning supreme  
In cool Tiruppuliyūr in whose ponds lotus flowers are in full bloom.

**Notes:**

The mate is gradually getting into the thick of the subject, by way of adducing incontrovertible evidence of the Nāyakī’s involvement with the Deity at Tiruppuliyūr, in order to convince the Nāyakḻ’s mother, still bent upon binding her daughter to the earthly home and heart'. The mate’s initial suspicion about the Nāyakī’s intimacy with the Deity at Tiruppuliyūr gets confirmed on three counts, namely, (i) the manner in which the jewels are worn by the Nāyakī at present, differs from that in which they were worn before, revealing the fact of their having been interferred with by some one else, removed and put back on her person; (2) her clothes also bear evidence of similar interference, and (3) the wholesome change in her complexion and comportment like unto the parched-up-land getting flushed with a copious supply of water, turning it lush and green. These are, as the mate puts it to the Nāyakī’s mother, unmistakable indications of the Nāyakī’s love affair with the Lord, which the mother should also take due note of. It is indeed impossible to reclaim the Nāyakī, drowned in the ocean of the Lord’s grace.




## 8.9.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

திருஅருள் மூழ்கி வைகலும் செழுநீர்நிறக் கண்ணபிரான்  
திருஅருள்களும் சேர்ந்தமைக்கு அடையாளம் திருந்தஉள  
திருஅருள் அருளால் அவன் சென்று சேர்தண் திருப்புலியூர்  
திருஅருள் கமுகுஒண் பழத்தது மெல்லியல் செவ்விதழே

tiruaruḷ mūḻki vaikalum ceḻunīrniṟak kaṇṇapirāṉ  
tiruaruḷkaḷum cērntamaikku aṭaiyāḷam tiruntauḷa  
tiruaruḷ aruḷāl avaṉ ceṉṟu cērtaṇ tiruppuliyūr  
tiruaruḷ kamukuoṇ paḻattatu melliyal cevvitaḻē

**English translation of verse 8.9.6:**

This lady’s lips are glowing red like the arecanut fruit,  
Which by the Lord’s grace thrives in cool Tiruppuliyūr, His favourite resort;  
This is a sure sign indeed that she remains immersed for ever  
In the sweet grace of Kaṇṇapirāṉ of oceanic colour.

**Notes:**

The arecanut trees in Tiruppuliyūr do not thrive on water but are fed by His grace. If the Nāyakī’s lips are also red like the arecanut fruits of that place, it only shows that she is also the recipient of His sweet grace. According to her mate, there are very many indications of her revelling in His grace, since long. Her reddened lips, with a special glow, not so pronounced before, the aftermath of her union with the Lord, put the whole matter beyond all doubt.




## 8.9.7
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மெல்இலைச் செல்வவண் கொடிப்புல்க வீங்குஇளம்தாள்கமுகின்

**English translation of verse 8.9.7:**

It seems this young lady has attained the bounteous feet  
Of the Lord in cool Tiruppuliyūr where plays the southerly breeze  
Amid cocoanut groves and ripe bunches of plantains waft fragrance sweet  
And lovely betel creepers nestle the mature, sturdy arecanut trees.

**Notes:**

“Even the inanimate things of Tiruppuliyūr live in close amity, moving hand in gloves; in such a glorious setting, the Nāyakī would appear to have mingled with the presiding Deity of the place and got on very well with Him,” says the mate unto the elders.




## 8.9.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மடவரல் அன்னைமீர்கட்கு என்சொல்லிச் சொல்லுகேன்? மல்லைச்செல்வ  
வடமொழி மறைவாணர் வேள்வியுள் நெய்அழல்வான் புகைபோய்த்

paṭaaravuaṇaiyāṉ taṉnāmam allāl paravāḷ ivaḷē.

**English translation of verse 8.9.8:**

What shall I tell you, elders, about the felicity of this damsel?  
She utters not anything but the holy names of the Lord,  
Who does on hooded serpent recline in Tiruppuliyūr cool,  
Whence the fumes of the ritualistic fire lit by Vedic scholars grand,  
Fed by ghee, right up to the sky, ascend  
And envelop the home of the celestials in the region beyond.

**Notes:**

\(i\) “The Nāyakī would appear to have been attracted by the vedic rites and rituals, in full swing, in Tiruppuliyūr and gone in union with the presiding Deity of the place.” says the mate. The mate is not in a position to say anything more about the Nāyakī. Could it be said that the Nāyakī was subservient to her mate or that the mate was also a party to the excesses committed by the Nāyakī or that the Nāyakī defied her mate and got out of hand? No, none of these and the mate could do nothing better than writhing her hands disconcertingly. It is indeed surprising that the Nāyakī should describe, without any reserve, the very bed she shared with her Lord, overlooking the fact that her mate was standing beside.

\(ii\) It is noteworthy that the Āḻvār, who is the author of the Tamil vedas, got attracted by the rituals performed according to the Sanskrit Vedas. These rituals of the Sanskrit Vedas propitiate the Lord, in His ‘Antaryāmi’ aspect, residing in all things and beings as the Internal Controller but not visible to the naked eye. The hymns of the Tamil vedas aim at service unto the Lord, in His ‘Arca’ or worshippable Form, being sung in front of Him, to His great delectation.

**English translation of verse 8.9.9:**

This young lady sings, day and night, nothing but the glory  
Of Tiruppuliyūr where bloom bright lotus flowers in sweet array,  
In huge ponds with crocodiles infested and the chantings sweet  
Of the vedic brahmins, like unto the roaring of the sea, reverberate,  
The cloud-hued Lord Kaṇṇapiāṉ’s favourite seat,  
Surrounded by fields many of fertility great.

**Notes:**

The Nāyakī speaks of nothing but Tiruppuliyūr, the exquisite form of the Lord enshrined there, the vedic chantings of the devotees over there and the lush fields and luscious fruits in plentiful supply. The mate avers that this clearly points to the Nāyakī’s involvement with the Deity over there.




## 8.9.10
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அன்றி மற்றோர் உபாயம்என் இவள்அம்தண் துழாய்கமழ்தல்

**English translation of verse 8.9.10:**

The aroma of tuḷaci, cool and nice, on this lady reveals  
Her contact gracious with the wondrous Lord in that crest jewel  
Of southerly direction, Tiruppuliyūr, where stand castles tall  
In cluster grand; what other reason can I, for this, tell?

**Notes:**

The mate now adduces yet another evidence which conclusively establishes the fact of the Nāyakī’s contact with the Lord at Tiruppuliyūr. The fragrance of tulaci, the Nāyakī’s person exudes, is the tell-tale, betraying her contact with the Lord, who wears the aromatic tuḻaci garland on His crown, chest and shoulders. “Could there at all be any other reason for this special aroma on the Nāyakī’s person?”, the Mate emphatically asks.




## 8.9.11
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நேர்பட்ட நிறை மூவுலகுக்கும் நாயகன் தன்அடிமை

**English translation of verse 8.9.11:**

Those that are well-versed in these songs ten  
Out of the choice thousand composed by Caṭakōpaṉ,  
The vassal of the vassal of the Sovereign Master’s vassals’ vassal,  
Will for His loving service become truly eligible.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The chanters of this decad are assured of the attainment of the final goal, namely, eternal service unto the Lord. The Āḻvār describes himself as the vassal unto him that stands last in the long chain of the Lord’s devotees, steepep [steeped?] in His loving service. Evidently, this sets the pace for the decad, that immediately follows, highlighting service unto the Lords’ devotees as the highest goal.

\(ii\) It has to be noted that this song refers to the Lord, the Sovereign Master of the entire universe, the essential nature of the individual ṣoul as the humblest servant of the devout, the excellence and potentiality of the hymnal expounding the Lord’s greatness and the ultimate benefit devolving on the chanters of this decad.
