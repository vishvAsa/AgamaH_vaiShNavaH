## 00 Intro4.6
In the last decad, the Āḻvār was seen at the acme of divine bliss, bubbling with joy and fully satisfied. The Lord has, however, since withdrawn Himself from the Āḻvār’s mental vision and he is now consigned to the bottom-most depths of dejection, transformed once again as a ‘Nāyakī’, unable to speak out her woe. It is her mate that speaks, in this decad. Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī is thinning down alarmingly, in her present state of extreme desolation. The elderly women around who notice this with great concern, seek the help of the professional sooth-sayer (a female gipsy) for divining the cause of the Nayaki’s malady and suggesting the remedies therefor. On being told by the gipsy that the Nāyakī is under the spell of a minor (inferior) deity, these women proceed to propitiate that deity with the customary offerings of meat, liquor etc, as advised by the concerned priest. This only aggravates the mental agony of the Nāyakī and, at this stage, her mate, who knows the real cause of the Nāyakī’s malady, is critical of the steps taken by the womenfolk and vehemently condemns them. Thus, this decad brings out the Āḻvār’s singular devotion to Lord Viṣṇu and his total abhorrence, rather intolerance of anything which smacks of allegiance to the minor deities.

It is indeed puzzling that such a traumatic experience should at all overtake the Āḻvār, just after what we had seen of him in the last decad. If one searches for any link between these two consecutive decads and attempts to explain the violent fluctuations in the Āḻvār’s fortunes, lack of coherence seems to be the only coherence, as Empār would put it, ‘asaṅgathireva saṅgathiḥ’. Of course, ‘asaṅgathi’ could mean either lack of coherence or disunion (i.e.) Separation from the Lord (viśleṣa). As a matter of fact, the vicissitudes in the mystic experiences of the Āḻvār, alternating between the satiate and disconsolate states of mind, constitute the chief feature of ‘Tiruvāymoḻi’. The Lord’s purpose in bringing about such contrasting situations has already been elucidated, time and again.




## 4.6.1
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

தீர்ப்பாரை யாம் இனி எங்ஙனம் நாடுதும் அன்னைமீர்,  
ஓர்ப்பால் இவ் ஒள் நுதல் உற்ற நல் நோய் இது தேறினோம்,  
போர்ப்பாகு தான் செய்து அன்று ஐவரை வெல்வித்த, மாயப்போர்த்  
தேர்ப்பாகனார்க்கு இவள் சிந்தை துழாய்த் திசைக்கின்றதே?

tīrppārai yām iṉi eṅṅaṉam nāṭutum aṉṉaimīr,  
ōrppāl iv oḷ nutal uṟṟa nal nōy itu tēṟiṉōm,  
pōrppāku tāṉ ceytu aṉṟu aivarai velvitta, māyappōrt  
tērppākaṉārkku ivaḷ cintai tuḻāyt ticaikkiṉṟatē?

**English translation of verse 4.6.1:**

Ye, Elders, where shall we seek hence, the one that can cure  
The malady of this young one, with forehead bright?  
A delightful sickness of Spirit ‘tis, I am sure,  
She her mind has lost in Him that drove the chariot  
In the wondrous battle and victory for the (Pāṇḍavas) five did secure.

**Note**

Face is the index of the mind. The agony of those killed by arrows or drowned in water is writ large on their faces. The unique sickness of spiritual character, the Nāyakī is suffering from, is reflected on her forehead The glow on her forehead helps to diagnose her malady as one that can be cured only by the Lord who inducted it, by stealing away her heart. Far from finding a cure for this, it is but meet that every one should aspire to acquire this kind of sickness and develop it. The Nāyakī felt entranced by the Lord’s overwhelming love for His devotees, doing all odd jobs, such as driving their chariots, running errands on their behalf and so on. The present malady is the result of such an infatuation. Actually, this reflects the mood of all the Āḻvārs, steeped in God-love, in sharp contrast with Rṣis, noted for clarity of mind, unperturbed by the sentimental God-love, God-hunger and things of that sort.




## 4.6.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

திசைக்கின்றதே இவள் நோய் இது மிக்க பெருந் தெய்வம்,  
இசைப்பு இன்றி நீர் அணங்கு ஆடும் இளந் தெய்வம் அன்று இது,  
திசைப்பு இன்றியே சங்கு சக்கரம் என்று இவள் கேட்க, நீர்  
இசைக்கிற்றிராகில் நன்றே இல் பெறும் இது காண்மினே.

ticaikkiṉṟatē ivaḷ nōy itu mikka perun teyvam,  
icaippu iṉṟi nīr aṇaṅku āṭum iḷan teyvam aṉṟu itu,  
ticaippu iṉṟiyē caṅku cakkaram eṉṟu ivaḷ kēṭka, nīr  
icaikkiṟṟirākil naṉṟē il peṟum itu kāṇmiṉē.

**English translation of verse 4.6.2:**

Ye, mothers, confounded, do not go the wrong way and propitiate  
The minor deity, You should know it is inappropriate;  
This young lady’s sickness is induced by the Supreme Lord.  
Better utter the words’ conch’ and ‘discus’, so as to be heard  
By her and you will then see it does her real good.

**Notes**

\(i\) The mate clarifies to the bewildered womenfolk, going the wrong way by propitiating the inferior deity, that the Nāyakī is not under the spell of any but the Supreme Lord and the cure for her malady, therefore, lies in their singing His glory, in a chorus, within her hearing. In fact, nothing but this will enter the Nāyakī’s ears.

\(ii\) Here is an anecdote. One Āyccimakaṉ, a pious nonbrahmin was sick and lying unconscious. As he was a great devotee of Lord Raṅganātha, Śrī Parāśara Bhaṭṭar went to see him and whispered into his ears, “Lord Raṅganātha (Aḻakiya Maṇavāḷa Perumāḷ) is the sole refuge”. This at once brought the patient back to his senses and he went on repeating these words, till the end.

\(iii\) There is yet another anecdote to drive home the fact that minor deities dare not approach the devotees of Lord Mahā Viṣṇu and much less make use of their belongings, for self-propitiation. One of the land-tenants of Piḷḷai uraṅkāvilli tācar, a great devotee of Lord Viṣṇu, was tormented by the village deity known as Aiyaṉār. For the appeasement of its wrath, the deity demanded that it be offered milk and fruits, be smeared with scented sandal paste, be nicely dressed and bedecked and then be taken out in a ceremonial procession in a litter with umbrellas held over its head. The villagers borrowed all these things from their master, the Tācar, and put through the procession, as demanded by the deity. But what was the result? The tortures of the tormented tenant were only redoubled. Queried by the villagers about its strange behaviour, the deity gave out: “You fellows have brought me the articles belonging to Tācar; under his umbrella, I feel blistered by the Sun, the sandal paste burns me out like fire, his ornaments hang on me like heavy fetters and so, I shall surely take this man’s life.”




## 4.6.3
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

இது காண்மின் அன்னைமீர்! இக் கட்டுவிச்சி சொல் கொண்டு, நீர்  
எதுவானும் செய்து அங்கு ஓர் கள்ளும் இறைச்சியும் தூவேன்மின்,  
மது வார் துழாய்முடி மாயப் பிரான் கழல் வாழ்த்தினால்,  
அதுவே இவள் உற்ற நோய்க்கும் அரு மருந்து ஆகுமே.

itu kāṇmiṉ aṉṉaimīr! ik kaṭṭuvicci col koṇṭu, nīr  
etuvāṉum ceytu aṅku ōr kaḷḷum iṟaicciyum tūvēṉmiṉ,  
matu vār tuḻāymuṭi māyap pirāṉ kaḻal vāḻttiṉāl,  
atuvē ivaḷ uṟṟa nōykkum aru maruntu ākumē.

**English translation of verse 4.6.3:**

Look here, ye, elders, try the recipe I suggest.  
Listen not to this gipsy, you’d better desist  
From offering meat and liquor; if you would but laud  
The feet of the wondrous Lord with tuḷaci garland.  
Studded with honey, on His crown, the sure remedy  
It will be for this young lady’s unique malady.

**Note**

The mate appeals to the good sense of the elderly ladies, not to be led astray by the queer nostrums of the gipsy, the votary of a deity of a very low order, and defile the sacred precincts of Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī with such unsavoury things like meat and liquor, totally repugnant to her breeding. She also stresses the importance of singing the Lord’s praise, as a sure and certain remedy for curing the Nāyakī of her malady, induced by the Lord Himself.




## 4.6.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மருந்து ஆகும் என்று அங்கு ஓர் மாய வலவை சொல் கொண்டு, நீர்  
கருஞ் சோறும் மற்றைச் செஞ்சோறும் களன் இழைத்து என் பயன்?  
ஒருங்காகவே உலகு ஏழும் விழுங்கி உமிழ்ந்திட்ட,  
பெருந்தேவன் பேர் சொல்லகிற்கில் இவளைப் பெறுதிரே.

maruntu ākum eṉṟu aṅku ōr māya valavai col koṇṭu, nīr  
karuñ cōṟum maṟṟaic ceñcōṟum kaḷaṉ iḻaittu eṉ payaṉ?  
oruṅkākavē ulaku ēḻum viḻuṅki umiḻntiṭṭa,  
peruntēvaṉ pēr collakiṟkil ivaḷaip peṟutirē.

**English translation of verse 4.6.4:**

Ye, ladies, what use is there, applying remedies queer,  
Leaving lumps of cooked rice, black and red,  
At the junction of cross-roads, by a quack misled?  
For this Nāyakī’s revival, better chant within her hearing,  
The holy names of the Lord Supreme,  
Who ate The worlds seven (during deluge) and then spat out.

**Note**

Once again, the importance of chanting the Lord’s holy names, proclaiming His glory, is emphasised by the mate besides repeating the warning, not to be led astray by the quacks.




## 4.6.5
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

இவளைப் பெறும்பரிசு இவ் அணங்கு ஆடுதல் அன்று அந்தோ,  
குவளைத் தடங் கண்ணும் கோவைச் செவ்வாயும் பயந்தனள்,  
கவளக் கடாக் களிறு அட்ட பிரான் திருநாமத்தால்,  
தவளப் பொடிக்கொண்டு நீர்இட்டிடுமின் தணியுமே.

ivaḷaip peṟumparicu iv aṇaṅku āṭutal aṉṟu antō,  
kuvaḷait taṭaṅ kaṇṇum kōvaic cevvāyum payantaṉaḷ,  
kavaḷak kaṭāk kaḷiṟu aṭṭa pirāṉ tirunāmattāl,  
tavaḷap poṭikkoṇṭu nīriṭṭiṭumiṉ taṇiyumē.

**English translation of verse 4.6.5:**

Ye, folks, this Nāyakī is terribly off colour,  
Alas! the methods you adopt can’t save her;  
Singing the names of the Lord who slew the tusker  
In must, let the dust from the feet of devotees pure  
Be on her strewn, there’s no remedy, so sure.

**Notes**

Finding that the methods, adopted by the elderly women around, worsen the condition of Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī, her mate lustily pleads with them to give up all their unwholesome activities and follow the certain remedy suggested by her. All that needs to be done is to scatter on the Nāyakī’s person, the dust collected from the feet of the devotees, pious and pure, to the accompaniment of the chanting of the names of the Supreme Lord. To preserve the Nāyakī is to preserve the Lord Himself, as the Lord thrives and subsists on her nourishing looks.

Two separate remedies, namely, chanting the names of the Lord within the Nāyakī’s hearing and smearing her with the dust off the feet of Śrī Vaiṣṇavas, have been prescribed for warding off the twin evils of contact with inferior deities and contact with those who have dealings with those deities, respectively.




## 4.6.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

தணியும் பொழுது இல்லை நீர் அணங்கு ஆடுதிர் அன்னைமீர்,  
பிணியும் ஒழிகின்றது இல்லை பெருகும் இது அல்லால்,  
மணியின் அணிநிற மாயன் தமர் அடி நீறுகொண்டு  
அணிய முயலின் மற்று இல்லை கண்டீர் இவ் அணங்குக்கே.

taṇiyum poḻutu illai nīr aṇaṅku āṭutir aṉṉaimīr,  
piṇiyum oḻikiṉṟatu illai perukum itu allāl,  
maṇiyiṉ aṇiniṟa māyaṉ tamar aṭi nīṟukoṇṭu  
aṇiya muyaliṉ maṟṟu illai kaṇṭīr iv aṇaṅkukkē.

**English translation of verse 4.6.6:**

Ye, mothers, pity it is, in wrong methods you persist,  
It does only aggravate the malady; I insist  
That you on this young lady smear the dust  
Off the feet of devotees of the Lord Who excels  
The blue gem rare; no other remedy can work so well.

**Notes**

\(i\) The elders pay no heed to the advice of the mate and persist in propitiating the inferior deity, which only aggravates the malady of the Nāyakī. An exasperated mate now asks them to stop their activities forthwith and smear the Nāyakī with the dust from the feet of Śrī Vaiṣṇavas. When the women plead that it is beyond them to collect the dust in question, the mate advises them to think of it, at least, as even the mere thought of doing so will cure the Nāyakī. Resolving to do the right thing and giving up the wrong things are two of the six pre-conditions for ‘Prapatti’ or loving surrender to the Lord’s grace, as laid down in ‘Śrī Pāñcarātra’. Whereas even the mere resolve to do what is right is enough, the evil or wrong things have to be necessarily given up. And so, the elderly women are asked to give up their unwholesome activities and just contemplate the right step, namely, smearing Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī with the dust off the devotees’ feet.

\(ii\) Here is an anecdote to prove the efficacy of the dust from the holy feet of devotees, by way of removing the contamination from inferior deities. Two devout followers of Śrī Rāmānuja accompanied Akaḻaṅka nāṭṭāḷvāṉ, a prince, while going to some place. On the way, the Prince pointed to a jain temple with images of lion in front, and jokingly asked his followers to prostrate, saying that it was their favourite Viṣṇu temple. It was dark and they couldn’t clearly make out which temple it was but they took the Prince at his word and reverently prostrated in front of the temple. When, however, a little later, they came to know that it was a jain temple, the shock was too great for them and they fainted. It was only when Piḷḷai-uraṅkāvilli Tācar, a very intimate disciple of Śrī Rāmānuja, arrived on the spot and smeared them with the dust from his feet, that they recovered their consciousness and got up. (The greatness of Tācar has already been alluded to, in the notes under IV-6-2).

\(iii\) Once, when Nañcīyar and his disciples were assembled in an enclosure, near the holy pavilion inside the temple of Lord Raṅganātha, this very theme of smearing the dust of holy men on the God-sick came up for discussion. One of the disciples wished to be enlightened as to how the foot-dust of the holy men is prescribed as the cure for a malady induced by the Lord Himself, instead of the very cause (the Lord) being also looked upon as the cure for the God-afflicted. The illustrious Preceptor elucidated that there are two distinct stages, namely, initial recovery through first-aid and then the Sovereign remedy. If buttermilk, the antidote for fits is not ready at hand, ginger-powder is applied to the patient’s nostrils, as a preliminary measure. The sprinkling of the dust of the holy men corresponds to the application of ginger-powder to the patient’s nostrils and when the patient recovers his breath somewhat, then the butter milk, the sovereign remedy, the beatific vision of Lord Kṛṣṇa (the Divine Charioteer, longed for, vide IV-6-1) will be administered.




## 4.6.7
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அணங்குக்கு அரு மருந்து என்று அங்கு ஓர் ஆடும் கள்ளும் பராய்  
துணங்கை எறிந்து நும் தோள் குலைக்கப்படும் அன்னைமீர்,  
உணங்கல் கெடக் கழுதை உதடு ஆட்டம் கண்டு என் பயன்?  
வணங்கீர்கள் மாயப் பிரான் தமர் வேதம் வல்லாரையே.

aṇaṅkukku aru maruntu eṉṟu aṅku ōr āṭum kaḷḷum parāy  
tuṇaṅkai eṟintu num tōḷ kulaikkappaṭum aṉṉaimīr,  
uṇaṅkal keṭak kaḻutai utaṭu āṭṭam kaṇṭu eṉ payaṉ?  
vaṇaṅkīrkaḷ māyap pirāṉ tamar vētam vallāraiyē.

**English translation of verse 4.6.7:**

Ye, elders, you think it is a cure rare and dear,  
For this young lady’s sickness when you offer  
Unto the inferior deity, sheep and liquor and, in distress, witness  
Men with trembling shoulders in awkward dance;  
Could you the moving lips of a donkey keep admiring  
As it eats up the paddy, spread out for drying?  
Better worship Vedic scholars, the holy men of the wondrous Lord.

**Notes:**

\(i\) The mate disconcertingly asks the elders what exactly they mean by persisting in all that tom-foolery, at the expense of Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī. What they do is like admiring the movement of the lips of a donkey noted for its ugliness, as it eats up the boiled paddy spread out in the open for sun-drying, unmindful of the loss of paddy. She advises them to worship the holy men who realise that Lord Śrīman Nārāyaṇa is the Supreme God and revere Him. There and there alone lies the cure for this God-sickness.

\(ii\) The mate feels distressed that the women-folk should indulge in such futile exercises, ill-conceived and disastrous, notwithstanding their special religious background and their ingrained belief that a single salutation by them would be deemed by the Lord, too heavy a burden imposed on Him.




## 4.6.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வேதம் வல்லார்களைக் கொண்டு விண்ணோர் பெருமான் திருப்-  
பாதம் பணிந்து, இவள் நோய் இது தீர்த்துக் கொள்ளாது போய்  
ஏதம் பறைந்து அல்ல செய்து கள் ஊடு கலாய்த் தூய்,  
கீதம் முழவு இட்டு நீர் அணங்கு ஆடுதல் கீழ்மையே.

vētam vallārkaḷaik koṇṭu viṇṇōr perumāṉ tirup-  
pātam paṇintu, ivaḷ nōy itu tīrttuk koḷḷātu pōy  
ētam paṟaintu alla ceytu kaḷ ūṭu kalāyt tūy,  
kītam muḻavu iṭṭu nīr aṇaṅku āṭutal kīḻmaiyē.

**English translation of verse 4.6.8:**

What you do, ye, mothers, is derogatory indeed,  
Speaking words unseemly, with a liberal use of liquor  
Amidst drum-beats propitiating the deity inferior,  
Instead of worshipping the feet of the Supreme Lord,  
Chief of Celestials, thro’ the good offices of Vedic Scholars,  
To cure the sickness of this young lady, the remedy sure.

**Notes**

\(i\) The mate advises the womenfolk to desist from the propitiation of minor deities and adore instead the feet of the Supreme Lord through the good offices of the Vedic Scholars, the Lord’s devotees, and get Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī cured of her God-sickness.

The direct approach to the Lord is hazardous like mounting an elephant in the absence of its keeper. That is why it has been ordained that the supplicant should be ushered in by the Lord’s devotees. It is noteworthy that Vibhīṣaṇa sought asylum in Rāma’s camp, only through his appeal to the monkeys around and Sugrīva also got at Śrī Rāma only through Hanumān.

\(ii\) In the preceding song (4-6-7), the holy men were required to be worshipped, while in this song, the Lord is required to be worshipped through the mediation of the holy men. This apparent discrepancy is reconciled by Nampiḷḷai, as follows: “There is, of course, no need to worship anyone other than the pious Śrī Vaiṣṇavas. And yet, it is extremely difficult to shake off the complex of fellowship and look upon other humans, like ourselves, as the Supreme and revere them with unflinching devotion. Hence, the next best, namely, looking upon them as efficient mediators for presenting us to the Lord, is recommended”.

\(iii\) The unseemly words are those uttered by the priest or other oracle of the inferior deity, getting into a trance, possessed by the deity. The mate warns the elders that the wrong tactics adopted by them will be a slur on their progeny as well and pull them down.




## 4.6.9
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

கீழ்மையினால் அங்கு ஓர் கீழ்மகன் இட்ட முழவின் கீழ்,  
நாழ்மை பல சொல்லி நீர் அணங்கு ஆடும் பொய் காண்கிலேன்,  
ஏழ்மைப் பிறப்புக்கும் சேமம் இந் நோய்க்கும் ஈதே மருந்து,  
ஊழ்மையில் கண்ணபிரான் கழல் வாழ்த்துமின் உன்னித்தே.

kīḻmaiyiṉāl aṅku ōr kīḻmakaṉ iṭṭa muḻaviṉ kīḻ,  
nāḻmai pala colli nīr aṇaṅku āṭum poy kāṇkilēṉ,  
ēḻmaip piṟappukkum cēmam in nōykkum ītē maruntu,  
ūḻmaiyil kaṇṇapirāṉ kaḻal vāḻttumiṉ uṉṉittē.

**English translation of verse 4.6.9:**

Ye, womenfolk, witness I can’t your activities base,  
The dirty concert of a mean fellow and hear the rotten words  
By him uttered; meditate on Kaṇṇaṉ’s feet and praise  
His glory; for generations it will do you good,  
It will cure this lady’s sickness besides.

**Note:**

While condemning the base activities indulged by the womenfolk, the mate advises them to meditate on Lord Kṛṣṇa’s feet and sing His glory, as this will operate both ways, that is, it will stand them in good stead for generations to come besides curing Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī of her God-sickness. This is like those harvesting jute making bundles of it with jute itself, unlike the paddy stalks, for tying which one has to look for some other material, a string or rope.




## 4.6.10
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

உன்னித்து மற்று ஒரு தெய்வம் தொழாஅள் அவனை அல்லால்,  
நும் இச்சை சொல்லி நும் தோள் குலைக்கப்படும் அன்னைமீர்,  
மன்னப்படும் மறைவாணனை வண் துவராபதி-  
மன்னனை, ஏத்துமின் ஏத்துதலும் தொழுது ஆடுமே.

uṉṉittu maṟṟu oru teyvam toḻāaḷ avaṉai allāl,  
num iccai colli num tōḷ kulaikkappaṭum aṉṉaimīr,  
maṉṉappaṭum maṟaivāṇaṉai vaṇ tuvarāpati-  
maṉṉaṉai, ēttumiṉ ēttutalum toḻutu āṭumē.

**English translation of verse 4.6.10:**

Mother, You mouth base words at will  
And in awkward dance your shoulders tremble;  
None but the Lord Supreme this lady will deem  
Fit for worship, You’ll therefore do well to hymn  
In praise of the lovely Prince of Tuvarāpati, by scriptures adored  
And revive this lady, make her dance and go gay galore.

**Notes**

\(i\) The mate insists that the womenfolk should take due note of the Nāyakī’s unbounded love for Lord Kṛṣṇa, the Prince of Dvārakā and remould their activities suitably. “What fun is it, tending the nose for an injury in the knee?”

\(ii\) Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī has never worshipped any one but the Supreme Lord, not even as a tender child. The crescent moon is usually worshipped by young children but Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī didn’t do that, even at that tender age.

\(iii\) The mate vehemently deprecates the elderly women’s mis-directed activities, ill-fitting and totally unbecoming of the clan to which they belong. By indulging in these activities, they harm themselves as well as the cause they intend to serve, namely, relieving Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī of her sickness. On the other hand, if they praised the Prince of Dvārakā, it will elevate them and also revive the Nāyakī, making her get up and dance with Joy.




## 4.6.11
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

தொழுது ஆடி தூ மணி வண்ணனுக்கு ஆட்செய்து நோய் தீர்ந்த  
வழுவாத தொல்புகழ் வண் குருகூர்ச் சடகோபன், சொல்  
வழுவாத ஆயிரத்துள் இவை பத்து வெறிகளும்,  
தொழுது ஆடிப் பாடவல்லார் துக்க சீலம் இலர்களே.

toḻutu āṭi tū maṇi vaṇṇaṉukku āṭceytu nōy tīrnta  
vaḻuvāta tolpukaḻ vaṇ kurukūrc caṭakōpaṉ, col  
vaḻuvāta āyirattuḷ ivai pattu veṟikaḷum,  
toḻutu āṭip pāṭavallār tukka cīlam ilarkaḷē.

**English translation of verse 4.6.11:**

They will of miseries be rid that recite, adoring and dancing.  
These songs ten, deprecating those that go about appeasing  
Minor deities, out of the flawless thousand of Caṭakōpaṉ,  
Chief of lovely Kurukūr, of flawless fame in-born,  
Who danced in adoration of the lovely Lord, gem-hued  
And serving Him, with devotion great, got his sickness cured.

**Notes**

\(i\) This decad has clearly brought out the Āḻvār’s unflinching and exclusive devotion to Lord Viṣṇu (Śrīman Nārāyaṇa), of sapphire hue and his intolerance of those who stray into the domain of worship of the minor deities The elderly women listened to the mate’s advice, at long last, and by adoring the Supreme Lord and dancing, in a body, singing His praise, they did help the Nāyakī regain her consciousness. It is not as if she got a cure as such, much less a complete cure. Actually, it is an incurable malady, not being of the ordinary run. This God-sickness lasts as long as the Soul exists and the Soul never dies.

\(ii\) This end-song confers the boon of relief from all miseries, particularly, the pangs of misery of separation from the Lord, like those undergone by the Āḻvār, on all those who recite these ten songs, with great devotion. The chanters will not run the miserable risk of contamination by straying into the domain of worship of minor deities.
