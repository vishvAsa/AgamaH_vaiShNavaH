## 00 Intro1.2
The transcendental glory of the Supreme Lord, His Supremacy as the material cause as well as the efficient cause and final cause of all life and being, the fact of His being the one and only Giver, either directly or through other minor deities, whose favours their respective votaries seek. His lustrous Feet being the sure and certain means of salvation for one and all, all these having been revealed to the Saint by the Lord Himself, the Saint revelled in this blissful knowledge, in the preceding Tiruvāymoḻi. Far from being selfish and self-centred, he wanted to share all this knowledge with his fellow beings, as a matter of mutual joy and enlightenment. But, alas! he found them all steeped in worldly life, just the very reverse of what he was. And yet, He would not lose heart. Banking on their inherent capacity to discriminate between good and bad things, he now exhorts them to give up the elusive and obnoxious pleasures of worldly life, disengage themselves from the erroneous notions of ‘I’ and ‘Mine’ and dedicate themselves to the apprehension of the limitless wealth and splendour of the Supreme Lord and reap the rich harvest of eternal bliss and beatitude. In this decad, the Āḻvār also teaches that true renunciation is of the mind, as distinguished from mere bodily displacements, such as fleeing away from the haunts of men and living a secluded life in a forest. No place is safe and impregnable to the invasion of temptations which could molest the mind, as seen from the examples of Ādi-Bharata (Jaḍa-Bharata) and Śaubhari.

The Āḻvār exhorts, in the third stanza of this decad, as follows:

> “Pluck out the disease of ‘I-ness’ and ‘My-ness’, right from the roots
> and join the Lord”.

Renunciation, therefore, lies in disengaging one’s mind from the erroneous notions of ‘I’ and ‘Mine’ and surrendering oneself, *in toto*, to the will of God. Examples of such mental renunciation are found in King Janaka and Saint Kulacēkara, Did not the former say, unaffected by the illusory fire inducted by Sage Śuka, “mithilāyāṃ pradagdhāyāṃ na me kiñcitpradahyate?”[1]

Kulacēkara Āḻvār sang, in his ‘Perumāḷ Tirumoḻi, IV decad:

***Stanza* 5:**

> “This realm, with all its wealth, I abjure,  
> Riding the elephant in rut, frightful to behold;  
> The blessing of being a shrub, I implore,  
> At lovely Tiruvēṅkaṭam, abode of my Liege, Lord”.

***Stanza* 7:**

> “Little do I value being a King of Kings, all that name and fame,  
> Holding sway under a single parasol, white as the full moon;  
> Instead, ‘tis my earnest will that I should, as a jungle stream.  
> Course through Tirumalai with its honey-studded flower gardens”.




## 1.2.1
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

வீடுமின் முற்றவும் வீடு செய்து உம் உயிர்  
வீடு உடையானிடை வீடு செய்ம்மினே.

vīṭumiṉ muṟṟavum vīṭu ceytu um uyir  
vīṭu uṭaiyāṉiṭai vīṭu ceymmiṉē.

**English translation of verse 1.2.1:**

Give up, *in toto*, [all that militates against holding a rapport with God] and giving up thus, surrender yourself unto (Him) the Custodian [the great Ordainer and Granter] of Heaven.

**Notes**

\(i\) Śrīman Nārāyaṇa is the Granter of Heaven, and yet the Āḻvār has not straightaway revealed that Holy Name, just to set the mind (of the listener) on to enquire, that is, stimulate spiritual investigation. Actually, the revelation comes in the tenth stanza.

\(ii\) What is emphasised in this stanza is the sacrifice of the worldly appetites to the surpassing love and beauty of God, the supreme preference to God, as against the adulteration of the senses towards earthly disposition-

If giving up has been mentioned first and surrender to the Lord next, one has to appreciate this sequence in the context of a child holding by the hand a live snake, and the elders around crying out: “*Drop it* down, *drop it* down, it is a snake!” Another example would be a passer-by, seeing a house on fire, exhorts the inmates of the house, “*Come out, come out*, your house is on fire”. The emphasis thus rests on that which is to be eschewed, it being obnoxious, the very antithesis of the Lord to whom we owe undivided allegiance.




## 1.2.2
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

மின்னின் நிலை இல மன் உயிர் ஆக்கைகள்  
என்னும் இடத்து இறை உன்னுமின் நீரே.

miṉṉiṉ nilai ila maṉ uyir ākkaikaḷ  
eṉṉum iṭattu iṟai uṉṉumiṉ nīrē.

**English translation of verse 1.2.2:**

You will do well to pause for a while and discover for your selves that the bodies the souls get into [and look upon as the media for the enjoyment of sensual pleasures] last no more than the (fleeting) lightning.




## 1.2.3
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

நீர் நுமது என்று இவை வேர்முதல் மாய்த்து இறை  
சேர்மின் உயிர்க்கு அதன் நேர் நிறை இல்லே.

nīr numatu eṉṟu ivai vērmutal māyttu iṟai  
cērmiṉ uyirkku ataṉ nēr niṟai illē.

**English translation of verse 1.2.3:**

Cutting out, root and branch, all sense of ‘You’ and ‘Yours’ join the Lord; there is nothing as good as that for the Souls [there can be no greater felicity than that].

**Note**

It would indeed be difficult to enumerate the thousand and odd things to be eschewed and discarded. And so, the poet just tackles the root causes of all the evils, which have to be eradicated *in toto*. Instead of wording as ‘I’ and ‘Mine the Āḻvār has cautiously put it in the second person, as ‘You’ and ‘Yours in this stanza, lest the very things he abhors and advises others to eradicate should corrupt him even at the mere mention thereof, in the first person—the risk of getting his tongue blistered, avoided.




## 1.2.4
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

இல்லதும் உள்ளதும் அல்லது அவன் உரு  
எல்லை இல் அந் நலம் புல்கு பற்று அற்றே.

illatum uḷḷatum allatu avaṉ uru  
ellai il an nalam pulku paṟṟu aṟṟē.

**English translation of verse 1.2.4:**

Renouncing all else, seek Him (*īśvara*) of *limitless* bliss, very different from the [seemingly] non-existent [fleeting and everchanging] material things and the ever-existing (non-changing) sentient beings [with their limiting adjuncts].

**Note**

An inexhaustible fountain of bliss that the Lord is, one has to attach oneself to such a fountain, only through a complete severance of attachment to the ephemeral and illusory worldly pleasures and distractions, with uncompromising rigidity; hence, this advice of the Āḻvār to the fellow-beings.




## 1.2.5
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அற்றது பற்று எனில் உற்றது வீடு உயிர்  
செற்ற அது மன் உறில் அற்று இறை பற்றே.

aṟṟatu paṟṟu eṉil uṟṟatu vīṭu uyir  
ceṟṟa atu maṉ uṟil aṟṟu iṟai paṟṟē.

**English translation of verse 1.2.5:**

Freed from worldly attachments, the Soul attains emancipation [from the erstwhile bondage]; however, shunning that [menacing state of self-enjoyment, known as *kaivalya mokṣa*], seek firmly the [bliss of eternal service to the Supreme] Lord, with exclusive devotion unto Him.

**Note**

Mere liberation from bondage resulting in a state of the lustrous soul getting lost in self-enjoyment (*kaivalya mokṣa*) is yet another hurdle, very menacing indeed, to be got over, being a serious impediment to the far superior and blissful experience of service unto the Lord on the yonder side of heaven, this ‘*kaivalya*’ state also deserves to be shunned and discarded.




## 1.2.6
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

பற்று இலன் ஈசனும் முற்றவும் நின்றனன்  
பற்று இலையாய் அவன் முற்றில் அடங்கே.

paṟṟu ilaṉ īcaṉum muṟṟavum niṉṟaṉaṉ  
paṟṟu ilaiyāy avaṉ muṟṟil aṭaṅkē.

**English translation of verse 1.2.6:**

*Īcaṉ* (the Supreme Lord), being solely attached to His devotees, He is ‘All-in-One’ (everything) unto them. And so, [ye worldlings]! hold on to Him and get absorbed in serving Him exclusively.

**Note**

Thinking that the worldlings (whom the Āḻvār addresses) might have their own misgivings about the easy accessibility of the Supreme Lord, Whom they are being asked to court and venerate, the doubt is being cleared in this stanza. Side by side with overlordship there is in Him the astounding quality of amazing simplicity, which predominates and makes it appear that this is His natural trait, and the other quality of Supremacy is super-imposed, rather serving as a foil against which the former shines all the more.




## 1.2.7
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

அடங்கு எழில் சம்பத்து அடங்கக் கண்டு ஈசன்  
அடங்கு எழில் அஃது என்று அடங்குக உள்ளே.

aṭaṅku eḻil campattu aṭaṅkak kaṇṭu īcaṉ  
aṭaṅku eḻil aḵtu eṉṟu aṭaṅkuka uḷḷē.

**English translation of verse 1.2.7:**

Realise that all this exceedingly enchanting cosmic wealth, you behold, is that of *Īcaṉ* [and that you are but a part of that]; [with this sense of belonging] it behoves you to blend yourself into it.

**Notes**

\(i\) No doubt, it was duly emphasised in the preceding stanzas that the Lord’s native simplicity is far more pronounced than His overlordship, might and majesty. But the very thought of His majesty puts us, the insignificant tiny little beings nowhere, just like a bit of straw drifting on the bosom of the mighty ocean, being borne back to the shore by the curling waves. But all this fear would vanish when we realise that we form part of His possessions and are thus rightfully entitled to approach Him, in love, without fear of such vast distance existing between Him and us, as between the ocean and the straw.

\(ii\) The miraculous change wrought by this sense of belonging has been happily illustrated by that great Preceptor, Nañcīyar, as follows:

> (*a*) A merchant went overseas for trading leaving his wife behind in
> an advanced state of pregnancy. A son was born to them and grew up
> nicely. Years rolled on and yet the merchant did not come back home.
> There was an exhibition in a neighbouring place at which the little
> boy took up a stall and sold his wares. Just then, the aforesaid
> merchant also returned from abroad and took up a neighbouring stall.
> There arose a quarrel, one of those days, over the encroachment of
> goods in their booths and when it grew violent a passer-by, who knew
> them both, pointed out that the elderly merchant was quarreḷḷing with
> his own son. Hostilities ceased immediately and gave place to mutual
> remorse, with the happy *reunion* of father and son.
>
> (*b*) It was a lovely garden and the Prince had a great mind to enter
> it. But then, he was afraid of trespassing into somebody’s garden and,
> therefore, stood hesitatingly at the entrance. However, as soon as
> some one said, “This garden belongs to your father, the King”, all
> fear vanished and he dashed inside, roamed about and enjoyed to his
> heart’s content. So does our fear to approach the Almighty vanish as
> soon as we realise that we are His children, the natural objects of
> His boundless love.




## 1.2.8
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

உள்ளம் உரை செயல் உள்ள இம் மூன்றையும்  
உள்ளிக் கெடுத்து இறை உள்ளில் ஒடுங்கே.

uḷḷam urai ceyal uḷḷa im mūṉṟaiyum  
uḷḷik keṭuttu iṟai uḷḷil oṭuṅkē.

**English translation of verse 1.2.8:**

With true awareness that the triple faculties of mental apprehension, speech and bodily actions, already at your command, are meant to be solely dedicated to *Irai* (the Lord), place them at His exclusive service, duly divested of all their erstwhile misplaced attachments and inhibitions.




## 1.2.9
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

ஒடுங்க அவன்கண் ஒடுங்கலும் எல்லாம்  
விடும் பின்னும் ஆக்கை விடும்பொழுது எண்ணே.

oṭuṅka avaṉkaṇ oṭuṅkalum ellām  
viṭum piṉṉum ākkai viṭumpoḻutu eṇṇē.

**English translation of verse 1.2.9:**

Once you (realise your true relationship with God, He, as the Proprietor and you, as His property and) dedicate yourself to Him (with this awakening), all your sins (which kept you away from Him, so long) will cease; (once the cause ceases, the effect, namely, the body which tethers you will automatically cease) await then, the day when the physical body falls off.

**Note**

As soon as the body drops off, salvation, sure and certain, waits at the door of one who entrusts oneself to the Lord’s keeping, with the spiritual awakening, as above.




## 1.2.10
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

எண் பெருக்கு அந் நலத்து ஒண் பொருள் ஈறு இல  
வண் புகழ் நாரணன் திண் கழல் சேரே.

eṇ perukku an nalattu oṇ poruḷ īṟu ila  
vaṇ pukaḻ nāraṇaṉ tiṇ kaḻal cērē.

**English translation of verse 1.2.10:**

Seek ye, the mighty feet (the sure haven of all) of Nāraṇaṉ, who is, at once, the abode of countless souls of vast excellence and an inexhaustible fountain of bliss, the repository of innumerable auspicious attributes.

**Notes**

\(i\) The Āḻvār concludes this, his first address to the fellow-beings, by teaching them how to pray, that is, by giving out the substance of the eight-lettered ‘Tirumantra’, as above.

\(ii\) Kūratṭāḻvāṉ, who was teaching Tiruvāymoḻi to his two sons, Bhaṭṭar and Śrīrāmappiḷḷai, stopped short when he came to this stanza, explanatory of the holy prayer (Tirumantra), which had to be taught by their constituted Guru, Śrī Empār, residing in the same street, just a few houses off.

Āḻvāṉ ordered the two youngsters to go to their Guru and learn the meaning of this stanza. Just as they were leaving, he called them back, saying:

> “Stay! life is precarious and uncertain and one does not know who may
> live and who may die the next moment. You may, therefore, hear (the
> esoteric meaning of this verse) from myself.” He then proceeded to
> explain to them the purport of this stanza which has a direct bearing
> on ‘Tirumantra’. This only goes to emphasize that not a moment should
> be lost in learning the Science that will lead us to God, the more so,
> when human life is precarious and uncertain.




## 1.2.11
**Tamil text and transliteration:**

சேர்த்தடத் தென் குரு கூர்ச் சடகோபன் சொல்  
சீர்த் தொடை ஆயிரத்து ஓர்த்த இப்பத்தே.

cērttaṭat teṉ kuru kūrc caṭakōpaṉ col  
cīrt toṭai āyirattu ōrtta ippattē.

**English translation of verse 1.2.10:**

These ten stanzas, out of the thousand, sung in accurate metrical composition, by Caṭakōpaṉ of Tirunakari, with lovely ponds, convey his well-thought-out message (for the uplift and emancipation of mankind).
