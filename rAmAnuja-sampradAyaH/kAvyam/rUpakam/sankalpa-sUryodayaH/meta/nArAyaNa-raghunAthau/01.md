Nati. -My Lord! Surely the troupe of actors hasten, who are as much subject to thy control, as thy limbs, hands, legs, eyes, etc. are, the moment thou thinkest of them. By the way, I have one thing to ask of thee -What is the name and nature of the play about to be staged?

and of 
true nature of Jivatman' that will appreciate the singular plot of this Drama, where, the good and bad aspects of Jiva personate their respective presiding deities, and constitute the diverse characters (consequent). 
1. This striking performance will appeal even to men worldly disposed, for as much as it aboundeth in, (the demonstration of) the emotion of Heroism, evidenced in the conquest of Māhāmōha3 by Vivēka,-in the emotion of Mercy by the attitude of the Lord, in the emotion of Peace by the attitude of the Jiva seeking for salvation. 
Words fail me to adequately convey the singular significance of this Drama. Countless are the conches in the ocean, but 
not one of them can be the Conch Pāncha-

Let those ordinary rubies of little lustre which deceive the simple world remain in the mansions of the rich; of what avail are these ?-think of this for a while; could any even among the oldest rubies stand comparison, with that ruby which illumineth the Mole Srivatsa Vishnu's breast and which acteth as a mirror to Sri Lakshini's sports ?

The matter to be mentioned presently 
is the rarer feature of this Drama :--- 
1. The name of the Conch worn as a Weapon in the 
hand of Vishṇu.

The implied meaning of verse (10) is :— Wordly dramas seduce the minds of simpletons who cannot discriminate the main essentials of a scientific drama, but this is a rare drama (spiritual) which baffles all comparison with other dramas. 
Such as the Syamantaka-a ruby for which Lord Krishna fought hard with Jāmbavān, Srí Rāma's Bear-Chieftain. For fuller particulars, read Syamantaka-Upākhyāna, Canto X, Sri Bhagavata.

The plot of this Drama is so arranged as to discriminate the good from the bad. It is wrought by a a playwright of high altruistic temperament, whose mastery of the Upanishads is well renowned, the special object set in view being the salvation of mankind. 
Nati. My Lord! Whose opus is this Drama ? This audience doth evince sympathy for us, begot by its sense of high veneration held for this self-same dramaturgist! 
Sutradhara. My Love! 
My Love! Didst thou not hear

I. A large number of Advaiti Pandits from the North of India hailed once to Srirangam and challenged 
the 
Vaishyava savants there that they must either conquer them in controversy or embrace their creed. In fear and anxiety the Vaishyavas of Srirangam sent word to Venkatanatha at Kānchi (Conjeevarani), who, responding, came all the way to Srirangam and in Lord Ranganatha's temple defeated the Advaitins, after seven days' disputation. A full report of this disputation is collected and shaped into a book called Ṣatadūshani. Lord Ranganatha, immensely pleased at the great abilities of our Venkatanātha addressed him thus:- 
Well are 
we pleased that thou hast put down thy opponents and established the Ramanuja-Siddhanta which alone describes our nature truly. From now thou shalt be known in the world by our own title "Sri Vedantacharya." (See Biographical sketch.)

reply to the first of your two questions". Thinkest thou this Author is one who hath merely restrained the actions of his senses and who hath merely fixed his mind intently on the enjoyment of the Supreme Being? If so, I shall just tell thee the following 
1.  If the Muse, worthy of the galaxy of the sages, Manu, Vyasa and Vālmiki, fragrant with ambrosia, desireth herself to grace a person, who could stay her? Will any stop the Ganga which falleth on the matted hair of Siva, as arid as the Vindhya Mount, if she falleth, of her own accord, on a lame person? I shall now answer the second question.

The two questions are:-1. How could language used for philosophic researches be made to suit a dramatic production? 2. How could language used for vehement disputations with opponents fit in for a dramatic production?

¡Nati.--(With_joy). 
What my Lord sayeth 
is right, but how to 
account for the 
embodiment of the Emotion of Peace in this Drama when the Masters of the Histrionic Art maintain that there is no such thing as that emotion ? 
Sutradhara.-(contemptuously.) 
Lady! Them, then, I do not consider as connoisseurs of the Histrionic Art. 
1.  Methinks that they hold the opinion. that the Emotion of Peace could not be enacted, perhaps because of the difficulty to find in this world an audience to appreciate that emotion. 
Further :- 
1.  The Erotic Emotion pampereth the ways of the wicked; the Emotion of 
20 
Valour breedeth mutual contempt; the Emotion of Wonder bordereth on the grotesque; the other Emotions are paltry enough. But Peace alone then by elimination is the Emotion that allayeth the agony of the mind. 
Nati. This superior Emotion (Peace) is of the experience of great sages, such as, Sanaka, Sanandaua and others. Still how could this Emotion, the essence of which is Yoga which is attainable only by the control of the sense-group, he represented in a drama, fit alone to be witnessed by philistines?

Lord Ranga appeared before Prajapati in His Praṇavākāra-Vimāna and Prajapati was worshipping Him for several years in Satyalōka, when the latter presented Him to Ikshvāku, the progenitor of the race of Sri Rāma, through his son Manu. Sri Rama made a present of this, his family deity, Ranga to Vibhishana, who then set out for Lanka, with the desire of installing Lord Ranga there for his worship, but lo! when he reached the present isle of Srirangam between the two branches of the Kaveri, Ranga was SO enamoured of the shady groves and green verdure of the isle that he took His abode there and declined to accompany Vibhishana any further. Such is the sanctity of Srirangam, the place where this drama was first staged. (“Srīranga-Mahatmyam" will give fuller particulars.)

1.  It is this Kāma that reduced the manliness of Mahēsvara by just one-half, that chastiseth those who scoff at Passion, the Third End of life. Facing us cometh this flower-weaponed Kāma, leaning his throbbing arm on Rati who walketh with an amorous, sportive gait. 
Therefore we shall withdraw quickly and conceal ourselves from this mortal world, where Cupid's festivals are in full swing and in tune with the current season, and deliberate what should be done later.

True! I shall inaugurate thy great festival, which bringeth victory to our great King Mahāmōha and driveth Vivēka

Look there:- 
1.  In spring do sport lustful lovers, who have the bees hovering over the blossomed blue lilies worn on their tufts, who hold in their arms golden-syringes and who have disordered forelocks which are besmeared with saffron-paste drenched by water driblets, diffusing the fragrance of musk, emanating from the leathersprinklers, pressed by damsels' hands. 
Kama. Very well, Vasanta! This is in our favor. This vile Vivēka is in every way vanquished almost, for, this great festival is begun in the regions bordering the Kāveri, before which the places of diversion in Svarga1 pale. 
1.  Here we see the Kaveri, which aboun-

Rati.-My Lord! This great festival lacketh its usual eclat, for, troubled is my mind at the thought that for some inexplicable reason the invincible and persevering Viveka is the enemy of our Lord Mahāmōla ! 
Kama.-Ah, thou simpleton! Ah, thou life of Kama thon presiding deity of damsels ! How is it that when thou shouldst rejoice at the gain of a mighty foe, thou with fickleness natural to women, praisest the

Look here:- 
1.  Was not even Siva, of the mighty Mēru1-bow, with fire-shafts accompanied by high-wind, for a moment unable to transgress the mandates of me, whose hand holdeth the charining sugarcane-bow, and whose flower-shafts are fixed in the beemade bow-string? 
Vasanta. - Madam! True! Take this not for a joke. The musquito can never the elephant's foe be, or perhaps, ignorant thou art of the world's ways.

Kama.-Ah, timid lady! Enough of thy 
excessive doubts. Thou seemest to be deceived by the simple fools devoted to our enemies, and so dost not understand the greatness of thy own party. 
Look for a while on the victorious weapons known in all the worlds three, of thy beloved, the conqueror of the universe! 38. Is not my premier bow the matchless frame of damsels, whose slender waist doth not exceed my wrist-hold, whose constant beauty is the bow-string, and whose earreaching and daintily curved eyes are the beautiful shafts ? 
Further- 
1.  If the melodious names of the sweet prattling damsels be but heard, it driveth all demeanour to a distance; good-bye it biddeth to peace of mind; modesty, it doth destroy; dispassion, it doth exterminate; what else will it not do? 
Vasanta.--Surely, this is a proposition a fortiori. Even the casual mention or hearing of38 
a woman's name causeth mental distraction, 
1.  Let alone the fact that the thought of women and their glances, prattles, etc, in an admiring spirit, driveth dispassion away to a distance. The thought of them, even in a carping spirit, doth surely drive dispassion away. 
Besides- 
1.  The attempt to restrain the mind, full of passion and wandering in the various woodlands of the senses, purely by one's own effort', is as impossible as that of trying to bind the Airāvata2 with a lotus-fibre. 
Rati. My lord! Thou shalt so ply thy prowess as to evade the ken of the great yogis', who are able to break the strong old illusion that body and soul are identical.

Rati. My Lord! Thy greatness is well known to me, but I am distressed, like the plantain (tree) shaken in a heavy gale, to think when and what may befall us, through the force of our ever-persevering, farsighted foe, strong to command and counsel alike, favored by God, and aided by several co-operators, such as Yama,2 Niyama, etc. Well known it is that the

Ah, thou simplteton and sweet prattler ! 
Where is the scope for wisdom in the presence of me-thy beloved, whose flower-shafts fixed on the humming bee bowstring, have the universe for their target, and who is ever confident of victory? 
By what means can salvation be 
(possibly) secured (while I am) ? Indeed the slenderness of thy waist is perhaps not evident in thy mind!

The heaviness of thy breasts hath (evidently) obsessed thy brain (or mind) as well, or, perhaps thou art no exception. to thoughtless talk, characteristic of charming women!

Look here! 
1.  Incited by me, Krodha' shall create infinite ignorance; this shall bring about failure of memory, which in turn shall obstruct the influence of intellect on Jiva; Jiva, bereft of intellect, shall fall into abysmal darkness and perish there. When it doth so matter, what shall stupid Vivēka do? 
Therefore Vivēka's ministers, Sama," Dama and others, shall never withstand the overwhelming might of our phalanx. By himself, invincible is Mahāmōha, whose left foot is planted on the diadems of all Dōvas and Asuras. A hyena is no equal to the Lion, the lord of beasts !

On seeing Urvaṣi (¿.e., born of thigh), the nymphs went away, seeing their efforts fell fruitless against Nārāyaṇa. 
43 
I have one thing more to ask of thee, not 
known to me yet. 
Kama. What is that? 
Rati.--What is the cause of the enmity, as 
between the lion and the 
elephant, 
between Viveka and his party on the one side, and Mahāmōha and his party on the other? 
Kama. Love mine! Thou shalt hear about this 
from the very beginning. 
1. 
2.  The chaste lady named Buddhi' lived with Jiva, in the abode of Mulaprakriti." and was ever devoted to him. She brought forth three sets of progeny from the triquality-bounded Jiva, each at a time, with a quality preponderating. The first of these is the set, Vivēka and his bandthe haters of worldly enjoyments, the second and third set is the joint family of Raga and Moha' combined. 
Intellect 2. The root cause of nature composed and Tomas 
of the attributes, Satva, Kajas 
(Goodness, Passion and Inertia.) 
1. Attachment. 4. Illusion. 
44 
In this triple family, Vivēka and Mahāmōha were respectively installed, as suzerain lords, by subjects akin to them in disposition. 
1.  Of these, the wedded wife of Moha is Durmati, with an eye ever adverse to Mōksha, and the devoted wife of Vivēka is Sumati, with an eye ever adverse to sense-lusts. 
2 
Rati. And then? 
Kama. Like the clan of Rakshasas co-operating with Asuras, Rāga and others, having passion, as their dominant trait fulfil the function of ministers to Mahāmōha, born. of the race of Tamas and the Lord Paramount of Samsara. The race of Vivēka, born of Satva, lacketh a large following and claimeth but few votaries in the world. Our progenitor Jiva, though by nature neutral, is now, through the influence of his wedded wife Buddhi, just at this moment inclined towards us, and this, the 
1. Evil mind. 2. Good mind. 
2. 
45 
ever wicked Viveka and his band brook not. Like the man of polemies defeating his own argument, not realising its weakness, these, unmindful of their own ruin, long to deprive Jiva of his temporal joys, along with us, who desire to advance those joys. They impute iniquities to Prakriti so long enjoyed by our progenitor Jiva and have so far, by some unknown means, succeeded in creating in him an aversion for the same, and they attempt to makehim embark on a long never-to-return journey'. In this, Viveka and his brood illustrate the action of the most wicked Sugriva and Vibhīshana, the respective lords of the Monkey and Rakshasa races who deserted" their own kith and kin. Difficult it is to describe the state of Jiva, 
Archirādimārga. 
1. The allusion here is to Sugriva deserting his brother Vālin, and Vibhishana his brother Ravaya, the two joining the side of Sri Rama and thus bringing about the destruction of their brothers. For fuller particulars, vide RamāyaṇaKishkindha, and Yuddha, Kandas. 
46 
at the time when Viveka maketh such an 
attempt. 
1.  Owing to the vile Viveka and his party, born-blind is this Jiva in discerning others' faults; foremost among the dumb in censuring others; stone-deaf in hearing others censured practically effeminate in enticing others' wives : ignorant in influencing others; and abashed even to behold others. 
Therefore it is that we desire to exterminate them, rupturing all fraternity. We oppose them with the aid of Pravritti' Dharma, and they oppose us with the aid of Nivritti Dharma. Their clan, having Satva for its essence, shall soon be overpowered by ours, like the glow-worm by the sun's rays.

After all, the sons despoil the father of his joys otherwise why would brothers plot each other's ruin ? 
My Lord! Is not peace that averteth abhorrent war possible between them and ye? 
Kama. Ah, simpleton! Peace is impossible 
under any circumstances whatsoever. 
1.  The virtuous and the vicious offend each other merely by the difference in their respective inherent qualities. How can even the lapse of myriads of Kalpas" bring about a reconcilation between the two ?

diametrically opposed to each other. 
If 
we two meet in one and the same subject, oh, sweet lady!, we either finish them or be finished. 
Even for parley, peace is impossible with our enemies-the votaries of Nārāyana, and us-the votaries of Artha and Kāma. Even if, perchance, peace be brought about by some effort extraordinary, our King Mahamōha, expert in destroying all enemies, shall brook it not. Myself, a matchless warrior, shall never subscribe to it. (The keenest hunger of) a tiger shall never (drive it to) feed on grass. 
Rati.-How have those exterminators of the race plotted to destroy mighty warriors such as ye? 
Kama. Ah, timid lady! 
This state-secret 
ought not to be divulged, particularly to 
women. 
Rati.-(Taking Kama by the hand). Dear 
Lord! Oath on me, oath on thy dear friend Vasanta, thou shalt disclose the state-secret in all its integrity (to me).

How to disclose it here? Hard, indeed, are the undetermined ways of Providence to surmount ! 
1.  (Alowl). Friend, Kama! The plot of the enemies' of Mahāmōha, capable only of rearing castles in the air, shall now be exposed by us-their enemies. 
Kama. If so, hear me speak. There is NivrittiDharma promoted by several perverse doctrines, disavowal of selfness in Karmas etc, all propounded by Vivéka-the foremost of fools, and practised by some austere philosophers plodding in the barren field of Upanishads and longing to exterminate our race by witchery. It is said that when Jiva is thus intent on NivrittiDharma, great mishaps befall him such as blindness, deafness, impotence, lameness, dumbness etc, in (the event of) discerning the fault of others. By way of revenge that selfsame Fiend of Nivritti-Dharma is going to prevail on Jiva to bring about a re-union with Buddhi. Therefore, out

But this sinful (brood) Vivēka and others, jealous of the joy of our race, play at games that tend to extinguish both the races, under the very nose of Jiva; blunt indeed are they of their wits as not to perceive their own ruin thereby. These ignorant people shall not, by any means, be successful in their enterprise.

We also strive to bring about eternal bliss to Jiva after liberating him from all miseries and even then keep our race sapient under the influence of (Jiva's) Buddhī. 
Do not the Upanishads proclaim thus ?:-

and the accident passing, the object springing back to its original quality. Similarly, this eternal Samsāra enshroudeth Jíva,' through the influence of eternal nescience, yclept Karma, and releaseth him the moment it vanisheth. 
Sumati.-True indeed! But how is it the all-benevolent Lord of Sri, hath so long neglected Jíva tormented by unbearable manifold miseries ? 
King.-Hast thou not heard that Jiva who biddeth for Samsara, by the bonds of nescience (Eternal Karma) was bidden away by the Almighty for the very reason that He bid for Samsāra and that the self same Almighty will extricate him on an opportunity lending itself?

Sumati.-Aryaputra! Ever doth the mind of the Devas and the sages waver as to the knowledge of the exact relationship between the soul and the Lord High. But thou fixest thy mind on Sri-Nārāyana alone. How? King.-Queen mine! This decision is dependent 
on the Upanishads, interpreted by (the key of) several Smritis, Purānas and Upabrihmanas. The harmony subsisting between the Vēdas, the Brahmanas and Nārāyana is well known. 
1.  The truth to be searched is Vishnu (ie., Nārāyana) alone. The authorities are the Vedas alone. The True-perceivers are the Sātvica Brāhmanas alone. Thus judged are that these three do constitute a harmonious group. What use then of the other (lesser) deities who are but worms* by comparison? 
2. Those which exegetise the matter briefly touched 
upon in the Srutis.

The saying of the great sages is to the effect-"the way by which the great ones. have gone 
is the best way."

Parisara,'-the real perceiver of truth 
1. Once during boyhood Parāsara, learning that his father had been consumed by a Rakshasa incited by Visvamitra, wanted to perform a sacrifice to exterminate all the Rakshasas. Vasishta intervened and requested Parāsara to desist from his desire to kill other Rakshasas who were quite innocent in the matter of the death of his father and then Parāsara stopped his sacrifice. Hearing this glad tidings, sage Pulastya came to the scene and feeling glad that his descendants were saved from a tragical death, blessed our Parāsara with the boon that he alone would perceive the true God. Vasishṭa also blessed him that the boon of Pulastya should prove true. Parasara has himself mentioned this in Vishnupurana. ef प्रदिशतु भगवानशेषपुंसां हरिरपजन्मजरादिकां समृद्धिम् ॥ colophon of the Vishṇu-purāṇa.... -

that pertaineth to the Supreme God, who prayeth for Moksha's eternal bliss, to come to all mankind,-bliss exempt from all pangs of birth, dotage and death,-himself supporteth our view, and this is quite enough. 
Sumati.-Aryaputra? This statement of thine doth not admit of a further rejoinder. I beseech thee to present to Jíva, in a nut-shell, the quintessence of all the Vēdānta. He is in earnest to arrive at truth, but is now perplexed in Vedāntic searchings demanding several substantial supports. 
King.—Well conceived. I shall meet thy desire.
