THEN ENTER DAMBHA AND KUHANA. 
Dambha.-Halloo! Kuhanā! my dutiful wife ! I want thee. For, thou art my co-partner, by none unpolluted, as was Tārā' owned by Brihaspati, and Ahalya owned by Gautama. Thou wouldst not brook even a moment's separation from me. 
1. Tara, the wife of Brihaspati was seduced by 
Chandra, under the pretext of discipleship. 
The 
Drama of Tārā Sasanka is too well known to be 
reproduced here in extenso. 
1. Ahalya, the wife of Gautama was seduced by Indra. The latter, enraged at this seduction, cursed his wife and transformed her to a stone. She continued in this stony state till Sri Rama gave her back her former form by the touch of his feet, on his way to Mithila. 
249 
Kuhana.-Thou, the best of Brahmanas, hast expressed correctly. And yet I blush at the illustrations cited. Thou, my master, shouldst have said: "As Arundhati' owned by Vasishta." Whenever I am courted by thieves, gamblers, village headmen, royal ministers, heretics and such others, I resort to them, taking them, quotha, for thyself! 
Dambha.-(Smiling). Therefore thou art the best of chaste women in all the worlds. My Agnihotra' and other sacred fires, even if interrupted, are kept burning by theemy sacrificial wife, by fires, brought from some place or other, when my Gārhapatya fire is extinguished. 
1. Arundhati, the wife of Vasishta, is reputed to be one of the unquestionably chaste ladies ever known. 
A ceremony performed daily, both morn and eve, wherein the housewife has to look to the unbroken continuance of Fire, all through her life 
1. One of the three kinds of sacred fires pertaining 
to married life. 
250 
My Sthālipāka' ceremony is similarly never interrupted, as thou concealest even thy menstrual course. Similarly again the Vaisvadeva and Pitriyajnya ceremonies are never interrupted. Where then is the occasion for expiation ? 
Kuhana.-Hush! 
Heaven forbid !! There is need for substitution, only when there happeneth interruption to Fire. In our home, interruption to Fire is a thing yet unheard of, for, our ever-pleased Lares et Penātes guard our Fires perpetually. Similarly, concealment of the periodical course shall be necessary, only if that monthly sickness ever appear at all. The same Lares et Penātes delay its happening, should it chance to appear during the parvas. 
Dambha.-Well, Kuhanā! Indeed, thou art 
1. A ceremony done with grain as the chief ingredient before the fire and completed on the full-moon day. 
2. A ceremony done with oblations to fire after 
the daily midday worship. 
1. Ceremonies relating to departed souls. 
2. Full-moon days when Sthālipaka is performed.251 
Much I esteem 
my co-partner in life. thee, as thou dost maintain my Brahmanism, thou-my sacrificial wife-the lawfully wedded wife of a great Srōtriya'. Always thou observest the Dvādasi2 vow, after sumptuously feeding me, who is ever pinched by hunger and thirst, even on Harivasaras days, privately and well thou showest thine vow to others, by ostensibly wandering from door to door under the pretext of gathering materials therefor. I shall now however unfold thee a secret. 
There now exist some Asuras, who have hid goodbye to all Dharmas, putting on the garb of ascetics, maintaining arguments tending to Māyā, seeming, as they

are, Kali-yuga itself incarnate. Thou shalt, at no time, leave my presence, seeing that these Asuras desire to entice thee, as Rāvana' and Arjuna once did. None but thou shalt even for a moment serve me, the best of Brahmanas. 
just now, 
Queen Durmati hath, requested me to practise some witchcraft on Vivēka, the desperado, who broodeth over some evil or other (to use) against our king Mahāmōha, the Lord paramount of all pleasures, both mundane and srargic. It is as follows:- 
"Well, boy Dambha! Thou who spoilest all the Dharmas of the universe 
shalt exterminate Viveka". 
Averse as I am ever to desires, out of extreme civility, believing in the sages' dictum-"There is no sin in exorcising

Kunana. - Fie ! Fie !! Alas! How witchcraft could be practised against Vivēka, the master of the quintessence of all the Sāstras, well protected by his cabinet ministers Sama, Dama, and others? They say that witchcraft practised in such a case recoileth on, and bringeth evil to, the practiser himself. 
Dambha.-Ab, silly Brahmani! What speakest

1. After conquering the whole surface of the earth, Parasurama, in all humility entreated me to accept the same as a present. I, treating the universe no better than a straw, rejected the offer. Lords of the immortals, surprisingly gratified at my glory, desired to give me Searga and Moksha, but rich in serenity, I rejected this offer as well. 
Kuhana.--(Musing). 
Never mind. Is the 
255 
sorcery, that thy distinguished self proposest to practise against Vivēka and in which thou requirest my co-operation, of the type of Syna' or of any other kind? 
Dambha. -Ah! great Srōtriya's lawful wife! 
I just tell thee the secret of secrets, known only to my most dutiful disciples. Tell this not even to thy companions, Trishna and others. The proposed witchcraft is not specially prescribed like Syēna'. 
But:- 
1. All that is ordained as virtuous by the Srutiand Smritis, but when done at my instance, do wholly act as sorcery against Vivēka. 
Kuhana.Well conceived, but who is it that initiated thee in this mystery of injury to others? 
Dambha. Pah, simpleton! To me who knoweth everything, who is the initiator? All who fancy themselves erudite only resort to me and get their doubts cleared. 
1. A particular form of sorcery 
256 
Albeit, I have taken one by the name of Garva, the disdainer of all worthy people, 
and one in the liking of all, who is the propounder of Mahāmōha's cult, as a mere witness in this affair. Awaiting his arrival, I sit with all materials ready on this seat of Kusā grass, spread by the sages seven, in this siddha hermitage, purified nine times over. 
Kuhana.Well done. The success of the enter- 
prise shall equally be fruitful. 
Dambha. (Gesturing omen). My guardian angel Kuhanā! My right eye throbbeth and this surely doth indicate the encounter with a friend-Looking in front). 
Who is yon great soul that descendeth to this mortal world and approacheth towards this hermitage with a form whose burning brilliance blindfoldeth the onlookers ?

tied firm a parchment inscribed with an oath). 
Darpa. - Incited by king Mahāmōha to condemn the best men, far and wide, I have wandered, just to discern the differences existing in the different worlds, and I have but now descended from Satyaloka' to this middle world, after thoroughly surveying all the quarters, up to the Chakravāla Mountain. Worshipped by the guardians of the Points of Space headed by Indra, I wear this ruby-garland, a present given to me by the Ocean3, the relative of the Vanquisher of the demons Madhu and Kaitabha, the Ocean, the donor to the Dévas of the great presents, the cow, the wine, the nectar, the Moon, the Pārijāta, the Kaustubha, the Chintamani,-the Ocean,

(Musing and laughing sardonically). 
Strange is this world's folly! Those, whom even to think as equals to my servants is ridiculous, fondly fancy themselves to be my equals and betters! 
1. In this world, men, whose minds shine with Vodic knowledge, the grammarians, those from all doubts in the Kalpa-sūtras free, again those toiled hard in the Vedāngas, and others well-versed in astronomy, others again who have mastered the verdict of Nirukti, and those strong in the three"

Mimāmsas, and yet others who ever plod in the vast fields of Nyaya,-all have been routed by me. 
(Gazing at the sky). 
Ah, fool! askest thou whence and how I got all this learning? 
(Clapping the hands and laughing). 
1. Who but Providence endowed the swan with the power of distinguishing milk from water? Tell me how long it took Agastya 
stya | to learn, to swallow the ocean deep. 
But mind not this superiority of knowledge, known all over the universe. Even as regards good antecedents and conduct, I am matchless. 
1. For, well known is my race in this world, for having given up the performance of even a single sacrifice, since the time of its first progenitor, for want of a suitable sacrificial priest to preside at the ceremony! Who knoweth my super-eminent, unrestrained penance, which 
260 
the 
beggars all description and which is not understandable by any,-penance, cardinal doctrine of which is that the senses should not be subjected to pain? 
1. Many are my disciples in this world who are known as Atheists and Heretics, quite competent to hide even the great Mēru',-under the very nose of the Devas, -through their artful arguments, striking and hypocritic! Aye, they would make us believe that the whole world is mad, deaf, lame and blind! 
2. If they do not do so, of what good are their arguments based on experience but which would not shut the mouths of the opponents? The whole universe I shall bring under my sway, bymeans of diverse frauds,-Mani, Mantra, Medicine! 
(What sayeth another?) "Sayest thou that when arguments based on Praminas are firmly established, why

(Frowning and hissing). Thou meanest of Brahmanas behold! Do the believers in Pramānas decline to believe in the black color of the sky which is borne out by Observation? 
1.  Enough of the Six2 schools of Philosophy, founded by the ancient Kānāda and others,-schools which are authorities only to those who believe in them ! What fixity is there when these schools, conflicting with each other, deny the main doctrine that God is only one? Let therefore the followers of my creed, perpetuate my doctrines, ratiocinatively and easily arrived at, and with but two or three determinate steps of reasoning, holding its own irrefutably.

These ar

2. One named Mandanamisra was defeated in a disputation by Sankara, the disciple of Bhattacharya, and true to his wager, the former embraced the faith of the latter and compiled a work named Surésvara Vartika Message from the Lord of the Immortals". The cardinal points in his theory are that Vijnana alone is real and everything else is unreal and that Charvaka faith alone is true and that the Vedas are false.

gether the mutually conflicting doctrines of Jina, Buddha, Brihaspati, etc, with deadly differences among themselves and tantaliseth credulous minds (not versed in Sāstras). 
These countries, infested by barbarians, who are no better than goats, beasts and birds, deserve not even a look from me. In these countries those who do not know even the alphabet carry big books under their arm-pits, and with heavy eyebrows put on the airs of erudite persons. Ah! deceived I am by my sight, directed to a distance ! 
1.  Enough of beholding these who prattle all manner of nonsense, conceited with their little knowledge, disregarding their own hierarchy of preceptors, ignorant of either Svarga or Moksha, fancying themselves as erudite, (their only virtue being the frequent dance' of their fingers) and 
2. The implication is that the erudition of these men lies only in their frequent movement of their fingers, thus posing as if they were learned men.

acting as ministers to foolish kings. 
(Looking to the North). Yonder some one cometh, facing the South, either from Kasmira, or Jalandhara. I shall just ascertain from him how my wives fare? Ah! good Brahmana! "Knowest thou the present plight of my wives Irshā, and Asūyā, who have set out to go round the Mēru mountain, under the leading of Durmati ?" 
(Then listening). 
"What! Savest thou that they are imprisoned in the depths of Nivritti Dharma, by Sumati's deceitful companions Maitri', Karuna, Muditā," and Upēkshā'" ? (With anger). Ah, this devil of a sinful Brahmana speaketh untruth. Ah thou mischievous bastard Srōtriga! Thou Brahma-Rakshasa! 
How could this mishap befall my

Are not yon countries in the midland regions between the great rivers the Ganga and the Yamunā? Who is here, though gifted with boons by Brahma and Siva, that will understand my doctrine, full of diverse theories which would baffle even those who profess the knowledge of Brihaspati? Much less he who could controvert, criticise or support my doctrine! These great cities are topsyturvied by the barbarian kings of the West, invited by our sovereign Mahāmōha to shut off the doors to Móksha. Here moveth about some Dāmbhika-Chakravarti?!

1.  This universe, drained of all its wealth, is duped by audacions cheats, who revel at night-time secretly in lecherous lust, which is augmented by the drink of wine at the special Sautrumani sacrifice of amorous sexual enjoyment with harlots, but who, at break of day, put on diverse deceptive appearances.

In these villages:- 
1.  The Samskaras are mere merrymaking festivities; Sandhya is performed only for diversion's sake; Savitri is ever interrupted by gossip; voiding of excrement is a mere show; thus is this universe topsy-turvied by the force of this Kali age, which acteth in harmony with king Mōha and which setteth forth the doctrine of the Alepakas.

Further:- 
1.  All these wander from street to street and thrive by usury, full of deceitful words. They never examine the (capacity of their) students, but merely make them chant the Vēdas like parrots, themselves not knowing the meaning and thrive in mere 
appearances. 
(Looking in another direction). 
These, looking like liberated men, painted in a picture, observe the vow of silence, sitting in the corner of a dilapidated convent. (Discerning carefully). Ha, Ha! They feign the performance of 
1. ef. Sruti: जातपुत्रः कृष्णकेशोऽमीनादधीते ॥ 2. See n. 2. p. 249.2 
271 
Pranayama, seeming, as if they have ceased living, holding their noses by their right hands, the fingers of which are fully covered with long Kusa grass. 
(Clapping the hands). 
1.  Ye great men follow the vow of silence through sheer want of ability to talk; ye esteem each other, as no body else care for ye; ye resort to alms, having no other go and ye follow the celibacy of a horse in harness, for a long time.

The act of restraining the breath with the utter- 
ance of Gāyatri. 
A horse ever tied and used could not enjoy its mate and so becomes a perpetual celibate for all practical purposes, though not of its own accord, but out of necessity. The insinuation here is that the particular persons referred to are celibates from necessity and not of free will. 
272 
men, not proficient in the war of words, not conversant in the course of logic,men prone to all manner of vows not authorised,-men not rid of the influence of vanity, and not known for high talents! 
(Casting the look in another direction). 
These are men who cover their whole chest with the holy-thread, not containable in a fist-hold, who hold the japa-garlands in their hands, and who frequently touch their hands. eyes, legs, etc, chanting hymns as they do so. They stretch their clothes, antelope's skin, Kusa grass, etc. as seats and sit on them near the high ways resorted to by caravans of way-farers. going on holy pilgrimages, Alas! Look at these great Yogis' strange aversion to desire; they cannot but laugh themselves in their own sleeves!

1.  The Dambhikas', really proud by their mindand sense-control, of their fonduet, meditation and absence of greed, After all, fail to approach even by a millionth part the pride of those Dambhikas', who feign to pose as men, bereft of all pride.

The killing of a woman is not sanctioned by the Hindu Sastras. Tataka being a giantess, her slaughter was instigated by Visvamitra as she caused great havoc to the sacrifices of great sages. 
1. Unfairness is attributed as Rama laid himself in 
ambush to kill Valin instead of striking him direct face to face. The controversy between Sri Rama and Valin hereon is dwelt at length in the Kishkindha Kanda of Sri Ramayana. 
1. Sri Rama had to face the tremendous odds of Khara's hosts of 14,000 men in Janasthāua and in the heat of the raging battle, he, ever known not to flinch even a step in all his valiant fights, had to retrace by a single step, overwhelmed by the might of the opposed forces(vide Aranyakanda of Sri Ramayana).

Thy success in Yoga is unquestionable. Thou seeniest to be quie affable. I therefore wish to know particularly thine residence, lineage, race, etc. 
Asuya.--Charming man! Thou askest me somnething unfit to be told by those belonging to the ascetic order. Without prostrating To me, how is it that thou standest like a sacrificial post?

Asuya. If so, in this hermitage, there is the allDharma-knowing sage. Through him, we shall have our conflict of duties cleared. 
Darpa.--I shall try to accommodate thy wish in the matter, but let that alone for a while. I have something else in my mind.

Asuya. I also fancy thee as having been seen 
by me before. But never mind this controversy now. I wish to prescribe some expiatory rite for thee, who simply wearest white clothes and standest like a lamppost, without prostrating to my noble self, whose feet is worshipped frequently at every ceremony, by even the foremost of ascetics, who take me for their superior

Could ye possibly be even the shadow of our likeness, having forms, self-luminious and splendrously bright as the Sun ? "Drop into perdition" is all that you deserve. Alas!

some self-styled Pandits, seem to preach a something unreal, but this creed of Brihaspati is no sooner advocated, than they (the Vedas) lose all their force and stand stupified in silence. 
Could even myriad reflected images of the Sun form themselves into a real Sun ? 
Durmati. -Aryaputra! Before this paramount faith propounded by Brihaspati, what is Mukti, what is enjoyment and what is God? 
Mahamoha. Just hearken. 
1.  The dissolution of body is Mukti; superb sexual pleasure is enjoyment; and damsels giving this pleasure and adorned with youth are the gods. 
And so it is, my queen, who knoweth the truth of truths! These, thy questions, have been replied to in consonance with Experience. 
The grace of these visible gods is the one thing to be sought after, for conquering our foe in the person of Viveka.301 
Durmeti.-May thou receive the grace of these damsels-living gods, and fit to be conversel with. But how is it possible to conquer Vivēka, through their grace? Mahamoha. Thus surely 
1.  The Yoga of even the men, intent on deep penance,-men who have mastered all the Vedas and who have restrained the senses outer and inner, the picture in the shape of slender-waisted damsels, painted on the walls-Imagination, even without the aid of the artist's brush, shall undo. 
The Vedantins state that even those dear to the Supreme Lord on account of their aversion to sense-enjoyments refrain not from pleasures but indulge in diverse pleasures, eating, drinking, sporting with women, riding on carriages, etc, and this is the great virtue (of our faith). Indeed none would fly from the fear of the scorpion to the mouth of the dragon.

These are the evil counsels of the ruiner of our race, Viveka. All wary then, we must cover the whole universe with vice, in such a way that there could be no opportunity for Vivēka. Vice alone is virtue for us, who are intent on preserving our race. The Ithasins' aver :-Virtue and Vice alternate according to individual situations." Viveka, by himself not very strong, thus reduced to straits, shall easily surrender. After all, what is this Vivēka ? It is certainly no hard task for the sickle to cut the herb,
