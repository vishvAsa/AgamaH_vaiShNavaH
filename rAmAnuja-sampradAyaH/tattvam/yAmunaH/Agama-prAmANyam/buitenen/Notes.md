[132]: Then, one may suppose, the child would not so readily associate the birth ceremony with the previous com. mueniation.

[133]: supra §36.

[134]: The things-meant or denoted by the word, [135]: Yamuna's argument is that the injunctive, etc. termina tions of the verb denote the injunction as their thingmeant (padartha); but what makes this injunction 136

'meaningful' is not that it is an injunction, but that it is connected with someone who is qualified to accept the injunction, e.g., in the injunction soargakāmo jajeta. The injunctive yajua has no meaning or purpose unless there is a "desire for heaven;" the meaning of the injunction thus is connected with the consequence of this desire of heaven, namely, that somebody who has this desire is prepared to do something about it.

[136]: ardhajarati is a half-old woman; the ardhajaraliyanyāya is used to indicate that the opponent wants to have it both ways and that consequently his argument, like a half-old and half-young woman, is useless either way.

[137]: Misra's text here has pady api prartly anu papattisamadhigamaniyaiva Sabdaŝaktis "the denoting power of language is to be known only through the impossibility of operation," which makes no sense. The reading must be corrupt, in anu papatti we may find a corruption of yulpatti, in pracrtti perhaps a corruption of kāryārthe or kāryārtha-. I read conjecturally karyar the vyutpatti. samadhigamaniyaiva, which gives the required sense.

[138]: This holds for those statements which are not verifiable by other means of knowledge, for if they are verifiable, they are no incans of knowledge in their own right.

[139]: read na hi kriyakārye vyut pannaḥ sthāji karyam.

[141]: [140]: athayi; the Prabhakara view is that the karya has a lasting efficacy beyond the inevitably transient action it involves; for the karya must remain in order to effect the fruit of the action at any time after the completion of the action. Yamuna objects that we cannot have two altogether different denoting powers in langauge, one to convey a transitory thing, another to convey a non-transitory thing. The only possible explanation is that of laktand "figurative usage," which remains related to the mukhjā "principal usage." But he will deny the entire construction (67).

137 [142]: This is the Pribhikara view, which holds that in the injunction nijaga seargakāmo yajeta the sadhya (object to be realized) is not sparge, but the entire niyoga (cf. Prakarapapañcika, p. 190), so that the statement of the injunction would become the means (sadhana) to realize that sadhya, sc. the injunction.

[143]: Cr. Prakaraṇapañcikā p. 182.

[144]: Nothing can become a fact (siddha) as long as it is still to be made a fact (sadhya) by a factualizing" means (sadhana); thus as long as it is related with such a means it cannot be a fact.

[145]: This is the principle of ekarakyata: a statement can contain only one injunction, otherwise there is aakyabheda: what should be one sentence is split up into two.

[146]: Quotations not identified; but for the argument, see Prakarapapañcikā, p 183 f [147]: No specific fruits are attached to nitya rites.

[148]: mahatmya, which corresponds to pradhanya, pradhānatā 149. BA Up. 5.6.1.

[150]: Not to be found in the major Upanisads.

[158]: supra § 36.

[159]: This must refer to the śruti sa yo ha voi tat param veda น brahma veda brahma bhavati (quoted Ramanuja, Vedārthasarngraha, 91), which I have been unable to locate.

[160]: Taitt Up. 2.1.1. brahmatid apnoti param.

138

[161]: This must refer to Taitt Up. 2.1.1 so'fnute sarpan kāmān saha brahmaṇā vipaściṭā, but sa samagaḥ is obscure, unless one may regard it as a corruption of vipafcitā.

[162]: Partial quotations from Taitt Up. 2.1.1, Mund Up. and an unidentified source.

[172]: cf. Varaha Pur., 72.4, which reads padrate in b.

[173]: cf. Varaha Pur. 7026 na tasmat parato devo bhavita na bhavisyati. It is clear from several quotations from this Purana that Yamuna's text had different readings, not all of them better.

[232]: this speaks to 108, that the independent cognition cancels the dependent cognition, if there is conflict between them. Yamuna makes the point that this is not invariably true; that neither dependence nor independence is a cause of invalidation, sapeksanira peksatve is a dual and requires the correction of karanam into kārane, If my understanding of the text is correct.

[233]: namely, because it requires another cognition in order to be denied.

[234]: namely, in the example of the burning lamp: is it the same flame that burns at six o'clock and at seven o'clock? We don't see the flame change or be succeeded by another flame. Only inference shows that since there is a different amount of oil in the lamp at different times, it is different oil that is burning as a flame, so that the flame is really different. The sense perception is of the varying amounts of oil.

142 [235]: The Naiyayikas.

[236]: Since Brahma is the creator of the world, he can know whether there were Vedas or not before creation; by taking away Brahma's memory, God in His omnipotence could start the myth of the preterpersonal origin of the Veda..

[249]: Quotations not identified; the groups enumerated are shüdras, and yet by Vedic injunction have to observe, ie., to accept, the few Vedic injunctions addressed to them. Do they by their acceptance invalidate these injunctions?

[253]: supra § 15.

143 [254]: ie., is the same name used for several groups or only one? 255. The argument is: if S is P, then P is not therefore S.

The example is 'parvato 'gnimin dhumavattvāt if we interchange S and P, we get parvato dhumavin agnimattvåt, but this is not true, for though there is no fireless smoke, there is smokeless fire. Similarly here: the fifth may be a sitvata or a vaidya vratya, but being the fifth does not make the sitvata a vaidya vratya, [256]: In the Manu quotation supra § 15.

257, explained below, § 130.

[268]: For the word means etymologically "maker of chariots, carts."" [269]: not identified.

[270]: By refusing to accept a rudhi meaning the authority of the Vedic statements concerning all the features of the sacrifice made by the now disqualified chariot-maker would be lost, and the authority of the statement that caste names may designate more than one caste would also be lost.

[286]: If he does not believe that God is present in the effigie, the offerings are obviously not used and cannot be characterized as left-overs. The priest's avoidance of them would simply amount to sinful waste.
