THEN ENTER KAMA AND VASANTA. 
Kama.Friend Vasanta ! 
1. Sugar-cane so tender for my bow, 
yon flowers for my shafts, 
Bee-swarm humming sweet harp's 
melody for my bow-string, 
Fair sex, timid and weak, for my 
battalion ; all these true. 
With these aids tender, of my own 
will, prosper I-the conquerer 
of the Trident-wearer.1 
Further :- 
1. With missiles and shafts, by thee 
2. Siva. 
granted,

And with thee for my help ever 
See how Móha great wieldeth, 
unfailing, 
The universe under one umbrella.1 
Vasanta.-What sayest thou? Thou art Kama 
indeed! 
3. Through prescribed and proscribed 
Karmas with their senses performed, Longing for some results, the 
savants awakened, 
To thee of infinite marvel, impute they, Their deeds, saying "Kama did 
them and Manyu' did them". 
1. With Siva and others, thy sportive 
battles thou didst have, 
Thy free diversion-resorts are Deva- 
chief's mansions, 
Thy pleasure-park is this sea-girt 
earth, 
Ah Madana! How to describe thee, the 
splendour's ocean? 
1. The meaning is that the whole world is under 
Mōha's Lord paramountcy

Well-known it is that the origin of Sumanas1 is thyself universe delighteth in thee; thou art indeed the foremost of the thrice-two seasons: Jótis2 entirely doth depend on thee: Madhava where Sri' doth dwell, bearing Pankaja, is all thy own and Kama is thy minister. What other better season is there that can match with thee? 
Besides :- 
1. Thou art the Fire named Vasanta ; this Malaya zephyr is thy charioteer: Asóka

and other flowers, thy Hames; bee-swarms,. the array of smoke; nectar-born moon, the feeding fluid; therefore the tree of Virakti' of the Creator, Siva and others, is burnt away by thee, who hast wiped away even the name of Santi.2 
Vasanta. - Great warrior and 
fish-bannered 
Kama ! The greatness of persons like myself is entirely of thy making. 
For:- 
1. The seasons, of whom I am the chief, are the artists granting thee thy diverse weapons. The Moon and the Sun betoken thy time of victory and rest.* 
Kama. Enough of this abundancy of mutual belanding! State business should first be attended to. 
Vasanta. I shall act, my friend! as thou dost bid. Of one bent of mind as we are, the duty of enkindling the sentiment of

providing all the ways and means of sexual love in Jiva. now engaged in the practice of Yoga, shall be mine exclusively, and that of thine the wherewithal' to provide suitable objects of love. 
Kama.-Comrade! I shall act up to thy wishes. Jiva, whose meditation of the blessed Lord is but recent, could easily be turned away, by holding up before him the allurements of ephemeral pleasures, accustomed to which he has been all along. Is there not this Brahman (for him, viz,)-the fair-eyed damsels, themselves the end and aim of all ambition, visible indeed to the eye of all Beings, the Devas, the Asuras, the Siddhas, the Gandharvas, the Vidyadharas," the Kinnara, the Kimpurushās and the Mānushas-all?

212 
Think not that this is improper :- 
1. Why could not the damsels, who minister to the exquisite of pleasures and who are the cause of the procreation of the universe, be called Brahman, in so far as they do possess the Brahman's attributes'? Vasanta. Friend! This, thine opinion, is borne out by chapter and verse in the Upanishads, for quoth. they (Upanishads) that damsels alone are the Brahman. say that Brahman is a male is but a complimentary twaddle. 
2. Youthful maidens' sidelooks bashful 
To 
and lovely, 
And their amorous tricks (or play), 
adorned most in their unadorned 
simplicity, 
Even the best Yogis, captivate, 
Even Eternal Brahman-a hundred- 
rejecting!

मोक्षप्रदत्वं = Grant of salvation; जगत्कारणत्वं creative 
cause of the Universe. 
1. स्त्रियो हि ब्रह्मोतवा पुमान् । 
213 
Kama.--(With joy) Dear Vasanta! What thou 
sayest is true indeed. 
For :- 
1.  This assemblage of celestial nymphs, whose looks make one mistake them for ranks of arrows, shall now, under my commands, go a-dancing and anon capture Jiva, albeit so intent on attaining Peace beyond works (ie. Brahman). 
Vasanta. Flower-shafted friend! So long as the fair sex is under thy dispensation, our mission is as good as fulfilled. 
Now:- 
1.  With ears made merry by the honey of melodious music, with eyes carried away by rapturous dance and with heart enslaved by diverse emotions erotic, the mind' of Yogis can never decline from the bevy of blooming damsels. 
Kama. (Pondering and with a sardonic smile) 
1 Resolve not to give up Yoga. 
214 
1.  Should, disregarding me, Vivekaprond in the company of Vyavasaya' and others, would yet fight with me, he himself should bring about the fate of Saubhari2, captivated by a hundred damsels. 
Vasanta. No wonder! For, renowned indeed 
are thy valorous deeds! 
1.  The merry she cuckoos, (as if they were)-the musical instruments of Panara, Vēnu. Vina, etc.-ever sing the valor of thee, blossom-bowed Cupid, that hath the bow-string made up of the swarm of bees, delirious with the drink of honey, flowing from the blossoming Kalpaka blooms that make thy bow!

A sage named Saubhari, while penancing in the midst of water, beheld a fish, surrounded by its offspring. Enamoured of this, he gave up the penance, himself longing to enjoy a similar happiness and married the hundred daughters of Māndhāta for the purpose. (See Vishnu Purana). A kind of musical instrument. 
1. Flute. 
2. Harp. 
215 
Hence thou needst use not much effort 
to accomplish such a simple task. 
1.  Bend not in vain thy bow whose flower-shafts never yet missed their aim; fill not thy bow-string with the lovely flower-arrows. Friend! Even at the mere sight of thy weapons-the flowers-brought by me into existence and laid in reserve by hundreds in thy quiver-the trees' branches, quiver indeed shall Vivēka. 
Kama. - This sort of mild enthusiasm will not 
do in the matter of a mighty foe. 
For: 
1.  Doth not the sun rise with a full thousand rays to dispel the darkness which could (though) be dissipated even by a little light? 
2.  Set aside the story of fight for have 
not the poets chronicled that indescribable misfortunes have attended persons who allowed themselves to be slighted. even 
Ji 
216 
in a small measure, as in (stories of) gambling' and verbal debates2. 
Vasanta.-How is it that thou, though holding the whole universe under thy grip, underrate thy own greatness and anticipate the slightest slight from any person what- 
soever ? 
A thousand locusts cannot screen the thousand-rayed sun! 
1.  So long as thy army is active, with its infantry-the charming beauty of lovely women, its cavalry-their amorous gait, its elephant-division-delirium from draughts of wine, and its chariot-division-sexual enjoyment, who with any regard for Yoga can ever remain alive? 
Now the Jiva hath not yet scaled upto the high pinnacle of Yoga. Such being the case, why for no reason doubtest thou that we shall not achieve our object! 
1. Vide the chronicle of Dharmaputra and Nala. 
Hi 
Sisupala. 
217 
For it is found :- 
1.  That the Jiva, aware as he is of the pit-falls of Samsāra, doth still long for the same; though he speaketh of the attainment of Brahman, still he doth hanker after mundane prosperity; though he yearneth for the Ocean of Joy, he doth at the same time shamelessly shrink. Therefore the Yoga of the Jiva in such a dilemma, could with very little effort be frustrated. 
Kama. Thou seemest to hint that the best opportunity to slay the Jiva is this,-while asleep. 
1.  Most opportune therefore is this time for me to exhaust all (my) weapons on the Jiva who hath not yet completed his Yoga, -like Arjuna attacking Karna, when the latter felt abashed at seeing his chariot slightly sunk in earth! 
Vasanta. Very well. If thou dost so, thy 
efforts shall sure with success be crowned 
1 Vide Karua parva of Mahabharata 
218 
1.  The person, who hath solely set his heart on tumbling into the mire of Yoga, that could not dry by ever so many sins, owing to Virakti's fraudulent ways, shall yet have all his Nirrēda' and conceit shaken out by the blows of thy weapons all and he shall again hanker after diverse delights, to which Rudra, etc, are addict. 
2.  
Breaths there the Yogi with soul so 
dead against desire who longeth not for the pretty prattle of women,-pretty-made by smiles,-halting accents and sensuous feastings, the prattle, serving as it were, for the triumphal flag of our victorious army, what by Malaya wind and the moon-light, what by jasmine and the hum of bees and such composed? 
Kame. Friend! A simpleton surely is Viveka, inasmuchas he trieth to effect for the Jiva, who is such a victim to physical and mental infirmities,-the success of Yoga. But it shall be as futile as crossing by swimming the high seas, as flitting 
1. Detachment. 
219 
across the blue vault of heaven, as drinking at the mirage, and as taking a bath on earth. 
Further :- 
1.  Vivēka, intent on liberating the Jíva, and-who is rolling dissipate in revelry and delirious with draughts of sensedelights-knoweth not (it seems) the worth of the amorous sports of celestial courtesans, their charms resembling honey, dripping from nectar-soaked grapes. 
Just mark here the two horns of the dilemma :- 
1.  If, through the power of discrimination, a person, in whom the power of aversion fto worldly pleasures) hath just dawned, doth fret at me, how could he possibly be said to have subdued Anger (Krodha)? If (however) on the other hand he casteth away anger, how could he be said to have shunned me (Kāma)? Vain therefore is the twaddle of fools who speak of the subdual of (both) Anger and Desire! 
220 
(Then enter Krōdha dressed in a horrid guise.) 
Krodha-(Approaching in haste). 
Hail my 
friend! Hail, my blossom-bowed Kāma!the vanquisher of Vivēka by movements unhindered! Who is this partisan of Vivēka who prattleth in vain about the subdual of Anger and Desire? 
(Walking round horridly and with a loud laugh). 
1.  How is it possible here to speak of Viveka, when I-the Vanguard of several arch-chiefs, dancing on the horrid stage of war-am here, I, whose followers, the Asuras, raise feverish panic in the bosoms of Deva-damsels, whose (Devadamsels') sandal-paste, put on to cool heat, anon drieth up? 
Kama.--Welcome, my good friend Krodha, the foremost among charioteers and ever ferocious towards my enemies! Thou hast come in right time, intent on helping me, when I have been deeply deliberating221 
as to how I should fulfil my master's mission. Thou hast under thy sway the great Mahēsvara and others, who (ever so much may) exercise self-control. Hurrah! Our great king hath conquered! 
Further :- 
1.  When vanity hath vanquished, when I (Kāma) have stopped havoc, when Mōha hath ceased enthusiasm, when the forest of sin hath burnt away, yet thou, alone of all, fed by the manifold kinds of fuel, say of a particle of contempt, art capable of disrupting Yoga for the Supreme Brahman! 
Vasanta. Surely this meeting of Kāma with thee (Krodha) doth resemble the conjunction of wind with fire! With materials, all so ready, why should we tarry any further? Success surely followeth in the wake of enthusiasm. Methinks success will crown us, if we only adopt the plan (of nocturnal slaughter) advocated by our dear friend. Kāma. 
1. Siva. 
222 
For:- 
1.  Let fawn-eyed celestial damsels,with their glances dancing like the bees that form Kāma's sugar-cane bow-string-with lovely breasts bending that make them be mistaken for the ruby-creepers' flower bunches, guarded by Kama's demireps,walk round the Jiva, who is absorbed in 
Virakti. 
Kama.Friend! The best of seasons, Vasanta, remindeth us opportunely of what we should do. With Kródha marching in front, heading the celestial-courtesanbattalions, I shall follow, with the string firmly braced to my bow; and thou shalt follow at my heels, guarding the flanks, with all wistfulness, vigilant all round. 
(All march as described above) 
Vasanta. Oh Kāma and Kródha-the foremost in Mahāmóha's army! Hear my advice. This is the occasion to despoil Yoga that is about to be begun, by nocturnal slaughter. For yon riseth the moon lustrous, 
225 
making the oceans four swell. Behold now in our front the rising moon-beamsharbingers, as it were, of the emerging moon-the lover of the blue-lotus tank and the servant of the moon-faced young damsels, marching in thy front. 
1.  Yon moon-beams, as they are, 
milky sea's swell, 
From the whale's mouth, drunk 
and emitted, lovely as dame Night's 
amorous smile, 
Shining as white sandal-paste mixed 
with camphor white, 
Feast the eyes onlooking the East, as 
if drenching them in ambrosia cool. 
Besides :- 
1.  Behold you Udaya Mountain's 
splendour, doubled by the rising 
Moon's lustre, 
Seemning, as it were, an elephant with conch-docked ears and with flowing 
ichor color! 
224 
Krodha. -Ah dear destroyer of demon Sambhara1! In troth Vasanta but spake the fact. 
Now:- 
1.  The damsel moonlight, shining as the rising Milky Ocean, doth beget in the direction East, the daughter-peerless Loveliness who maketh blue-lotuses blossom. Behold the waxing night when lovely stars do twinkle and when the tress-like Darkness, seemeth, as it were, somewhat dishevelled by the throes of childbirth ! 
Kams. All regard is indeed due to my friend -the Lord of the galaxy of stars, who is armed with weapons, mighty to dispel pitch-darkness and who doth adorn the plaited hair of Siva. 
1.  This Moon, the shedder of lovely moonlight, the wishing-gem of the anguish

of the love-lorn She-Chakravāka, the instructor of Kāma-Sāstra, the mirthmaker of the triple-world, the vouchsafer of delight on the blue-lotus tank, doth dissipate steadily the darkness that hath held possession of all the directions. 
Further:- 
1.  You noon-beams, distilled from its rise from Vishnupāda, making the twinkling stars look like piles of foam, rising from the Udaya mountain and resembling celestial Gangā, doth give variegated colors to the Yamuna-like darkness. Friend Kródha! Behold the plenitude of my help! 
2.  You Lover of the stars is my loved friend; moon-light is my mate; Vasanta, who equippeth me with flowery weapons in abundance, is my relative esteem-worthy: in the event of danger, thou, O Kródha of irresistible force! art my protector. Who

then with any regard for life shall stand before me, armed with my bow of bloons ? 
Krodha.Friend! When fortune favors, what 
all to us shall favorable not be? 
Further :- 
1.  How to call a person desireless, wher he doth desire to conquer thee (Kāma)? If he doth not desire to shun thee, he is certainly not devoid of desire, inasmuck as thou desertest him not. 
Kama.-Enough of this procrastination, which 
is but the thief of time. This Jiva whohath entered on Yoga shall now be approached by us. 
(All do accordingly). 
Vasanta. --Behold this Jiva, who hath just embarked on Yoga, by Viveka directed, the latter doing all things opportunely for Jiva who is absorbed in meditation on the twin-feet of the Supreme Lord, renouncing all his attachment for sense-dictates. 
227 
1.  The Jiva peruseth the purānas1 which speak about the terrors of hell and yet falleth frequently into sloth: be perceiveth the soul as distinct from the body and at the same time tendeth the body with all care; he longeth deliverance from the ocean of sorrow and yet hankereth after sense-lusts. Pining 
thus, in a double life, he seemeth as if rocking in a swing! 
Kama. Friend Kródha! Vasanta hinteth that Jiva hath not yet attained the stage of profound meditation. Our help-mate Vishaya-rasand, ever (busy) begetting eternal and marvellous effects-a perennial stream-is unassailable even by those who have subdued the enemies-the senses external and internal":

1.  Even granting that Jiva transgresseth the ocean of samsara in secrecy (thus) engendering a longing for salvation and that he indulgeth in pleasing parleys with Yógis, even then, the mind, vestured by garments woven by evil propensities manifold, such as egotism, loseth anon its equilibrium. 
Vasanta. Terror of the enemy host thou art (sure)! Beware also of another matter. Even though one hath dissociated from society, self-esteem alone is enough to violate one's Yoga. It is for this self-same reason that Samvarta, Jada-bharata, Vidura and others, rightly understanding the moral of Hiranyagarbha's text', courted public contumely, serving as sin-remover and led a life as if of madmen. Therefore before the Jiva might arrive at this state of contumely-courting, let Kródha seize him swift, using contumely itself as the medium.

The implication is that Jamadagni lost his life through Kartavirya, as he (the age) became a victim to anger apparently through a snake and not through Anger (Krodha) seizing him directly.

Jíva who hath thoroughly renounced the world?

Who dare resist the force of the darkness of Kródha, more powerful than sleep, swoon and death-agony, effacing all established distinctions of castes and ideas of high and low and resembling the dark billows of Yamunā, overflowing its banks, swelled by downpours of coveys of clouds (gathering) at the time of the great cataclysm?

These kings of the earth, ever so firmly greedy for even a particle of a sod of this mean earthy earth, distract themselves; the lords of the immortals do ever tremble with fear, lest their position be coveted by anyone somewhere performing penance; even the ascetics who have renounced the world are not free from the weakness of censuring a person extolled by another. The whole universe is therefore under the influence of Durmati's maids Asúya' and Irshā.2 
2. Envy. 
3. Malice,241 
4.  Persons, seized by the demon of insatiable greed, trot though all the Quarters Ten; make the surface of the earth disturbed; sing the praises of the rich; volunteer menial service to others; cross the high seas with ships and wage vain 
wars. 
Vasanta.-Ah! long live thee, Mahāmóha's prime 
minister! What obstacles shall there be for thee-the promoter of the Second End of life, so liked by all minds alike, owing to its susceptibility (as means) for enjoyment, the End, proclaimed in Arthasistra,' that is so patronised by multitudes of kings, the end that is the Incarnation of wealth itself, so well co-operated by Trishna? 
1.  The End of life named Wealth (Artha) patronised by the votaries of Kamasastra" and begotten by means fair or foul, as may the tides of time determine, is entirely of thy making, what of earning. of hoarding and of refusing to the needy!

Ye shall heed this my proposal. How shall w we capture a person clothed in the unassailable armour of wisdom viz., Viveka? 
Kama. Friend! It is thus that I have made up my mind:-I shall advance in front; ye three shall, placing Trishnā in the centre, follow me and protect both the flanks and the rear. With such unassailable squadron as we are, the baffling of Viveka's efforts, bent upon ruining his own clan, shall be a fait accompli 
(All range themselves accordingly and walk five or six paces). 
Kama.(Waring his flowery bow fixed with sharts in haste). Behold ye, the target secured for the darts of my bow,-dartsnice and sharp, now braced to the string. 
1.  
Look here how yon person, espousing the way of surrender, realiseth his own self, by singular Yoga-practices, is steady by his senses multitudinous being restrained, breath controlled and weaned (from the worlds), 
243 
treading the way of Nivritti (renunciation). 
Vasanta.-(Looking carefully) 
attention we must now be. 
Heigho! all 
1.  Here museth Vivēka over some secret, helped by Sumati, and all secluded, after retrieving the Jiva from the Ocean of Maya', so as to make him reach Paramapada. 
Krodha (Knitting his eyebrows). Ah Vasanta ! Let the wicked Vivēka deliberate what he may. but the Jiva shall never defeat our designs, led (as we are) by Kāma in the 
van. 
1.  The self-born Kāma, who eateth up the wealth of faultless Yoga, catcheth witless beings, sporting themselves in the Samsara-sea, boisterous with mighty billows, by his hook of sense-enjoyment, making them thus his condiment. 
2. See n. 6, p. 72.

4. 
Fish to wit (e soul in Samsara are. like fish. 
caught by lust). 
244 
Behold the quaint meditative mood of the Jiva! 
1.  The Yogi, construing knowledge of the True Self as the mansion, blessed attribute-groups-his ornaments, meditation--his sexual enjoyment, secluded habit of austerity-his love-prattle, resorteth to his seraglio of Upanishads, shutting himself off from all the world. Thus doth he enjoy the moods of Love under the pretext of Peace. 
Vasanta.--(Aside). 
Enough of these vain hopes. These are mere castles in the air. 
(Aloud). Friend! In the presence of a mighty foe, of what avail are these bragging words ? 
Lobha. -Friend Vasanta! My wife Trishna hath to be consoled as she is afraid of the enemies' tumult. 
(Looking at Trishnā). Charmed looking Trishna! Fear not the foe, howsoever mighty, so long as thou art in the midst of 
245 
this great warrior-squadron. 
Trishna. So long as thou, esteemed by all the Dēvas and the A suras, art alive, I am ever free from fear. 
Kama.-(Looking round with fear). Now we 
must retrace our steps. 
1.  For, Viveka, with his natural strength of unfailing knowledge, with wondrous walk, well equipped with the firm armour of forbearance and contentment, appeareth before us, seated in the chariot of Pranava sent by Brahman, and he disperseth our squadron. 
(All fear). 
1.  If one of ye three, 
peradventure, 
meet with danger, surely Mahāmōha whose very life is in the lives of those devoted to him, shall himself put an end to kis life. Instantaneously shall his wife Durmati commit Sat. Therefore retreat from 
1. Army.

the presence of Vivēka is at this juncture most advisable. 
Lebba.--Fight we must not here, without our king. He himself will decide what yet 
remaineth to be done. 
Krodha.-(With disgust). 
But so far what have 
we done for our king's business? 
Lobha. Friend! 
1.  The march of time, with the high speed of the sun's car revolving fast, can not be impeded by the impact of a gust of wind from the opposite direction. The wise won't shut the door after the horse is stolen. Therefore it is better for us now to think how best we may tide over our future troubles. 
Therefore, in this affair, we must first protect our lives. For, it is said that one must protect oneself by every means in his power. 
Kama.--Our Lōbha, who knoweth the ways of 
the world, giveth us advice most apt. 
247 
1.  It is not meet that we, who wanted to adopt the policy of night-slaughter till now, should fall into the great abysmal pit of angry Viveka. Now shall Mahamoha himself strive to defeat our foe in action, himself leading Dambha' with his wife Kuhana and Garva3 with his wife Asūyā1 etc. 
Therefore we shall now disperse in different directions, for, they say that to save oneself he should forego the world. (Thus saying exeunt all).
