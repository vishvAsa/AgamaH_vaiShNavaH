title = "०२ Praiseworthy Contribution to Philosophical Literature"

+++
Bhagawadpad Shri Ramanujacharyaji resided for 12 years in Melkote (Karnataka) and propagated the Vishishtadwait Philosophy. He reestablished Melkote as the centre of Sanskrit and Vedant learning. Academy of Sanskrit research is established in this pious and religious town Melkote in 1978, with a view to remove the darkness of ignorance by lighting the torch of spiritual knowledge. 

In this Academy students, really desirous of higher education of Sanskrit are welcome. Shashtri Nirmaldasji of Shri Swaminarayan Gurukul, Rajkot got the opportunity of getting higher knowledge of Sanskrit in this Academy. Over and above other scholarly Pandits, Pandit Ratnam Mahamahopadhyay K. S. Vardacharyaji, who has been honoured by the Award given by the President of India, was deeply yet lucidly explaining the principles of Vishistadwait Philosophy, pointing out the various characteristics of Jiv, Jagat and Brahman giving many relevant references. 

Sadhu Nirmaldasji was highly impressed by the above clearcut and explanatory lectures of Shri Vardacharyaji and so he requested him that if a commentray on Vishishtadwait is written by him and published, it will be very useful. Further he also informed me and Sadguruvarya Shashtri Swami Madhavpriyadasji regarding the above commentry. 

Bhagwan Shri Swaminarayan has also clearly stated in the Shikshapatri that, faferera "Our doctrine of philosophy is Vishishtadwait. So we very willingly and voluntarily offered to sponsor all the expenses of printing and binding of Tattvamuktakalapa of Srimad Vedantadesika with Commentary Sarvankasha, if it is published. 

After this Pandit Ratnam Vardacharyaji has finalised the commentary working day and night and today we are highly pleased that it is published. This philosophical commentary will be highly useful not only to the students of higher Sanskrit study but also to all the persons interested in the philosophy. 

This commentary is the most valuable and praiseworthy historical contribution to the Philosophical Sanskrit Literature, for which Pandit Ratnam K. S. Vardacharyaji will be ever remembered. May Bhagwan Shri Swaminarayan bestow healthy and long life to Shri Vardacharyaji and more strength for the spread of Vedantik and spiritual knowledge.

जहदा 2 लेवडा, लुम्बिनी नवलपरासी, नेपाल 

We are happy to place this great work in the hands of our esteemed readers. Panditaratnam Mahamahopadhyaya K.S.Varadacharya, the author of the new commentary "Sarvankasha" offered the final draft of this work at the holy feet of Lord Tirunarayana at Melkote on the occasion of his 80th birthday celebrations. A sense of contentment and fulfillment felt by the author by this humble act delayed the action of finalising the presentation of this work to the readers. Anyhow by the grace and blessings of the Lord Tirunarayana this work has been able to see the light of the day. 

While studying the numerous ancient texts of our sastra the author was perplexed to find that while there were commentaries (Bhasyas) for the Nyaya, Vyakarana and Purvamimamsa sastras which were universally accepted, there was no evidence of an existence of such a single Bhasya authored by a Maharishi for Vedanta sutras. The author feels that perhaps that such a Bhasya existed and was lost due to the appearance of the cyclone of Vijnanavada of the Buddhist, which swept away the major aspects of Vedanta Philosophy. Hence the Acharyas who appeared later had no choice but to author commentaries (Bhasyas) on the Brahmasutras suitable to the times that they were in. Perhaps this was the reason for not having a universally accepted commentary for the Brahmasutras that is precisely in line with the real intentions of the author of the Brahmasutras. 

As a first step to remedy such a situation the author has tried to bring out a commentary for the purview of the impartial truth loving scholars of today. This does not mean that the author is presenting an entirely a new commentary of the Brahmasutras of Bhagavan Badarayana. For such a need does not exist, as there is not much of a controversy or difference of opinion in connection with a large portion of the Brahmasutras. The major controversy lies only with regard to the sutras associated with the form and the relationship between the three main factors namely Jiva, Jagat and the Brahman. If one were to reconcile these, controversies all the problems disappear by themselves. 

The author having this aim in view took up "Tattvamuktakalapa", which mainly deals with the form and the relationship between Jiva, Jagat and Brahman and has tried to present a commentary which will resolve the difference of opinion that exists between the different commentaries of today on the Brahmasutras.

Hence the author feels that this commentary may not be in line with the commonly accepted Visistadvaitic commentaries on "Tattvamuktakalapa". That is why the author has named this introduction as "Satyanveshana" (a quest for truth). If providence wills the author proposes to pen at least one more work onto delineate clearly the hidden truths of the sastras. 

Many scholars have assisted in bringing out this work. In the beginning, Vedantacharya Sastri Sadhu Satya Prasad Das and his associate Sadhus, Vidwan V. Sowmya- narayanan, Vidwan B.V. Ramapriya and others were associated with this work. Later on, Vidwan S.Krishnan, Sri K.V. Ramapriya M.A., Vidwan M.A. Alwar and Chi. Ananth took active interest and have been instrumental in bringing out this work. 

Vedantacharya Sastri Sadhu Satya Prasad Dasji Swami, belonging to Sri Swaminarayan Mandir, Bhuj, Kucth, Gujarat, has donated a computer and other accessories. The entire printing and binding cost has been taken care of by Vedantacharya Sastri Sadhu Nirmal Dasji Swami, belonging to Sri Swaminarayan Gurukul, Rajkot, Gujarat. We gratefully acknowledge their contributions and pray to the Almighty Lord that He bestow a long life, health and prosperity on all these persons associated with the publication of this mammoth work.
