In the world of everyday life (a king sometimes uses his dependents and ornaments to serve the purposes of those who are dear to him like his sons, wives etc.) and in the Vedas, it is declared that all the gods make their offerings to the devotee. Even so, the Lord of Lakṣmī  uses sentient beings and non-sentient things to serve for ever the purposes of those who have won His regard, because He is independent and is their Master. So, for us whose minds have been disciplined by the teaching of such as the prince of sannayasins (viz. Śrī Rāmānuja), the service of the Lord extends as far as the service of those who are dear to Him (Bhāgavatas).

REASONS FOR RENDERING SERVICE

TO BHĀGAVATĀS :

If it is asked here how it can be stated that the service of Bhagavān extends up to the service of His devotees (the Bhāgavatas), the answer is as follows:- It has been said in the Vedartha Sangraha: "He is the śeṣa whose svarūpa or essential nature is such as is chosen on account of the desire to promote the glory of another and that another is the śeṣī." So in regard to the Supreme Ruler of all, the Jīva   who is the śeṣa is bound to promote His glory. That glory will depend on the nature of the śeṣa, whether it be sentient or non-sentient. It may be asked, "What is the glory that the jīva is capable of conferring on the Supreme Being? With his body and the like, he can confer only such glory as non-sentient things do. So this service is common to him and acit. The special glory that he can be the cause of promoting must be by means of his intelligence or chaitanya.[^55] When the jīva acts against the spirit of the śāstras, Iśvara, who is the Ruler and the Dispenser of punishment, enjoys only the delight or delectation of līlā and thus attains atisaya glory. It has been said: " Bhagavān, 'who has all beings as His body, rejoices when a jīva does what is good and does not rejoice when the action is evil." When a man acts in accordance with the stāstras, he gives thereby delight to the Lord and thus does not let his generosity and other qualities run to waste, but promotes the glory of the Lord so that He extols him as in the words :-"All these are, indeed, generous". In the same way as the muktas (released souls) and the nityas (the sūris ) promote the glory of the Lord by direct perception of the Lord's will and by acting in such a way as to give Him bhoga or enjoyment, the prapannas, too, can give rise to a special kind of bhoga or enjoyment to the Lord and thus promote His glory as stated in the following śloka :-"When shall I*always be Thy servant, look upon Thee as my Master and in this way give Thee delight?". The prapanna learns the Lord's will from the śāstras (though not directly ) and renders service to the Lord.

[^55]: In the sentences that follow, the author points out the different ways in which different kinds of people (including those who violate his commands ) promote His glory as His śeṣas.

THE LORD IS PLEASED AT THE SERVICE RENDERED

TO HIS DEVOTEES :

When a man gives rise to Iśvara's līlā rasa by actions opposed to the śāstras, it will end in his ruin. If, in the state of bondage, he acts according to the Lord's will as revealed in the śāstras and, in the state of mokṣa , by direct perception of the Lord's will, he will not only promote the Lord's līlā rasa and bhoga but incidentally attain his own desired objects. When the Jīva   acts on any occasion consciously, since his desired fruit, incidental though it be, has to come from the will of the lord, the latter has to be ascertained from the s'astras which disclose that the service rendered to His devotees is most delightful to him.

The following authoritative texts may be studied in this connection: "Of all forms of homage, the homage paid to Viṣṇu  is the best, but superior even to this, is the excellent homage or adoration offered to Viṣṇu's devotees", "I have great affection to those who are devoted to my devotees. Therefore should one render devout service to them." "Devotion to me is of eight forms: (1) love to my devotees without any thought of their faults; (2) rejoicing at the adoration offered to me by another; (3) delight in listening to stories concerning me; (4) a change in the voice, in the eyes and in the body, while listening to such stories; (5) trying to offer adoration to me; (6) freedom from hypocrisy in one's relations with me; (7) meditation of me at all times; (8) and not considering me as one from whom worldly benefits can be bad - if bhakti (which is of these eight forms) is found in a mleccha, he should be respected as the best of Brahmins endowed with jñāna and bhakti; he is a real sannyāsi, he is a wise man and he may be taught (the scriptures) and from him one may learn the truth. He is fit to be adored even like myself.", "They are my bhaktas or devotees who do not show devotion to any other deity, who love those that are devoted to me and that have sought me as their upāya", "I offer adoration also to those who offer adoration to that yajna varāha, who is of boundless splendour", "By *seeking the protection of those who seek the Lord as their refuge and by rendering service to him who is devoted to the devotee, that is (in turn) devoted to the devotee of the Lord - by doing so, men are released from all their sins."

When we study these passages, (it becomes clear) that, of all forms of service which a śeṣa of the Lord may render, that rendered to the Bhāgavatas is the most important and is the most pleasing to the Lord, in the same way as the fondling of the prince is most pleasing to the king.

In this matter, if we examine the path of the pramāṇas, Iśvara, who has the Bhāgavata as His body, is the object of worship as is declared in the śloka : "Those who worship the pitṛs, the gods, the Brahmins and Agni -- they worship only the Lord who is the inner self of all creatures". If, on the other hand, we consider the thought of the Prakari who says "He is dear to me also" and who is ever at the disposal of the man that is exclusively devoted to Him on account of His love for him, as has been said in the śloka  : "Among them the jnānī is my very self" the Lord would be pleased at the service rendered to the Bhāgavata, as if it were service rendered (directly) to His own inner self and not as that done to His body.

In addition to its causing pleasure to the śeṣī, the relationship of the jīva to Iśvara as His śeṣa is also mediately through the Bhāgavata. Therefore his service to the Lord may also be mediate through the Bhāgavata. This may be explained as follows:

सह सद्वारकञ्च स्याच्छेषित्वं परमात्मनः ॥ ३६-अ  ॥

To the Supreme Being who is always with Lakṣmī  and who looks upon His devotees as His very self, the attribute of being a seshī may be both by being a seshi along with Lakṣmī  and by being a śeṣī  mediately through the devotees". (That is, those who look upon themselves as śeṣas to His devotees are, mediately through these devotees, śeṣas to the Lord Himself). A king who is independent and who takes a pleasure in acting as he pleases places the ornaments and garlands worn by himself round the necks of his servants and of his elephants and horses. (Tiruppapalvar says):-- "The Lord who is spotless and who has made me the servant of His servants". (So does Nārada  say): "I, Nārada , have come here with an eager longing to see you. To men like me, O Brahmin, those who are bhaktas of the Lord are masters" and again (Tirumaṅgai Alvar says ); - "I will not remain in the company of those who think there is any other deity deserving of adoration than Thee; also what I have accepted with delight is the duty of serving Thy devotees". According to these passages, since the jīva is absolutely subject to the will of the Lord and since the service of the śeṣa is due also to those who are favourites of the Lord, our being a śeṣa to the Lord extends even to the Bhāgavatas and should last as long as the self lasts. Our being śeṣas to Bhāgavatas arises from their being devotees to the Lord and pertains to our essential nature. It arises also from their qualities and knowledge, which cause a desire in us to serve them. (As Lakṣmaṇa says) "I am his younger brother (by birth); I have become his servant by his qualities". (That this relationship of being a śeṣa is due both to our essential nature and to (our admiration for) their wisdom and character) is also indicated (respectively in the two phrases(1) "bhaktas of the lord and to "men like me" (in the speech of Nārada  quoted above). Perialvar, the (great) commentator of Kalpa sūtras stated (in this connection):- "These who are the servants of Bhāgavatas and who utter the names of Bhagavān are entitled even to sell us". This is the purport of the middle world in Tirumantra, namely, namo: na mama (not for me). If we reflect on this purport, our being śeṣa to the Lord is both mediate (through the Bhāgavatas) and immediate (direct to Him). Accordingly, the service that should be rendered by the śeṣa is also (both ) mediate and direct. Therefore it is the farthest limit of the service of the prapanna to perform, as much as it lies in his power, service to the Bhāgavata, since it is part of the duty of one who is śeṣa to Bhagavān. So this outermost region of service to Bhāgavatas should be kept properly cultivated so that it may not become fallow land full of weeds.

. As stated in the following ślokas in Pauṣkara samhita, "It is not wrong for a wedded wife to honour her husband and to honour his servants, whether in his presence or in his absence."

and "Among the Lord's retinue are two classes: those that are dear to him and worthy of His trust and those who are not. To the former class belong the nityas, the muktas and the Bhagavatās.

To the latter class belong Brahma and the other gods who are subject to the sway of past karma. The seeker after mukti should not adore the latter;" the devotee who is exclusively attached to the Lord and whose dharma resembles that of a chaste wife would therefore do well to act according to the will of his Lord. Since the relationship of śeṣa to Bhāgavatas arises from no other cause than the knowledge of our being śeṣa only to the Lord and to no other, this service to Bhāgavatas is not improper, (because it does not arise from other causes like the desire for wealth or power ).

BHAGAVATĀS ARE ŚEṢAS TO ONE ANOTHER:

If it is asked whether this relationship of being śeṣa to Bhagavatās is due to one's nature or whether it is adventitious (due to upādhi), the answer is, that it is both natural and adventitious. In as much as it lasts as long as the self lasts and will continue also in the state of mokṣa, it may be called natural.

Does not Koorattalvan say) :-"When shall I join the eternal suris who are always eager to be śeṣas to one another " (This relationship of a śeṣa will continue even after release from bondage). It may be said to be adventitious also (due to upādhi or conditions), as it arises from a knowledge of one's relationship to Bhagavān.

If so, it may be asked, "If both are Bhāgavatas, would it not be inconsistent that they should be both śeṣa and śeshī to each other?" The answer is as follows:- There is nothing inconsistent in this, as it is possible for the same person to render help to another and also to receive help from him. (In the performance of a sacrifice), the sacrificer who performs it for the sake of some gain or benefit (phala) is the śeṣī but when he is considered as the doer of the sacrifice, he is śeṣa in relation to the sacrifice.

So also when each of the two Bhāgavatas is bent on promoting the glory (atisaya) of the other, without either of them expecting that glory, they become śeṣas by their being the cause of the promotion of the glory of the other; they are also śeṣī s inasmuch as they are the recipients of the glory (atisaya), though they themselves may not desire it. Since they have been directed by Iśvara's will to promote each other's glory, the relationship of being śeṣa to Bhāgavatas is, in the case of both, based on śāstraic authority.

The relationship of being a servant (dása) to Bhagavān and Bhāgavatas owing to an appreciation of their qualities or character adds to one's delight or enjoyment and promotes one's own exaltation. In this, Iśvara, by His omnipotence and His will which accompanies it, enables all Bhāgavatas to become śeṣī s. Taking their desire also along with His own will, Iśvara makes them śeṣas to Bhāgavatas. Since both the Bhāgavatas stand in the relation of śeṣī s to each other as having been fit to be directed by the Master to do His will, both of them attain their true and essential nature (svarūpa). They attain the ultimate limit of their puruṣārtha or goal of life, since they attain the relationship of being śeṣas, which they are eager to have and also the privilege of rendering service to the Bhāgavata which follows from it. Since Iśvara delights in having directed them to become śeṣas and śeshīs to each other, Iśvara attains the state of being an Iśvara or ruler and of being an enjoyer. Since they realise clearly that this relationship of being śeṣas and śeṣīs to each other contributes to the enjoyment (bhoga) of Iśvara, they attain the faultless and ultimate limit of puruṣārtha By those who have done what should be done (prapannas), who understand this subtle truth and are convinced of it, the grace of devotees who are exclusively and supremely attached to the Lord will be desired as an end in itself - devotees who are free from the following stains : the desire for transgressing the Lord's commands, excess of doubt, connection with other deities, enjoyment depending on one's own effort and enjoyment for one's own self.

We that accept the code of conduct prescribed by the Lord, whose auspicious qualities fill, with astonishment, Bhāgavatas who have understood the meaning of the Vedas - We conduct ourselves in such a way that we do not deviate from the righteous path ordained in the eternal Vedas in rendering service to His good devotees with extreme reverence to them.

With our words which emit a fragrance that would be eagerly desired by the lotus which arose in the pond of the Lord's navel, we do not beg of the Lord the pleasures of this world and of svarga which are like straw nor kaivalya nor even mokṣa . We only pray that we should have the grace of the pure and firm-minded Bhāgavatas, who are like the chaste wives in the royal harem, for their grace is like the dawn which beralds the day of the splendour of mokṣa ,
