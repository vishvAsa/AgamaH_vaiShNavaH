Having **laid**, on Mukunda, the responsibility for his protection  
and become free from sin like those **released** from saṁsāra,  
the prapanna **walks** along the path laid down in the śāstras until his release from bondage,

and since the path has been **ordained** for us by the command of the Omnipotent Lord  
and since, **by straying** from that path,  
he will immediately **bring**, on himself and on others, ills of various kinds.

To the man who is in this world full of the darkness of ignorance,  
the śāstra is required as a lamp (to show the path that he should take).  
So the service that he is to render  
should be according to the śāstra;  
in matters where the śāstra gives an option or alternatives,  
he may follow his own discretion.

"If a man has become a prapanna, the salvation of his soul or self is the responsibility of Bhagavān, and he himself has nothing to do with it. If he thinks that he has anything to do with it, his surrender of responsibility (prapatti or ātma samarpaṇam) must have been false or insincere. The maintenance of the body depends upon his past karma, and he should not feel anxious about it. If he feels anxious about it, he is a sceptic or nāstika. Therefore neither in regard to his spiritual welfare nor in regard to his bodily welfare, has he anything more to do. If so, it may be asked whether the man might go about doing whatever he liked with his three kinds of organs, mind, speech and body. The answer is that doing so is not in keeping with his svarūpa or essential nature. It is true that he has nothing (more) to do with regard to the upāya or means, but he should direct these viz., mind, speech and body to the rendering of service which is the goal of his existence. There are five kinds of service which he can render for the rest of his life: (1) to study the Bhāṣya and to spread the knowledge obtained therefrom; (2) if the man is not qualified for it, to study the writings of the Alvars and spread their knowledge; (3) if the man is not competent to do it (i.e.) No. (2), to serve in holy temples sanctified (by the Alvars), by cooking food, by making chandanam, by lighting lamps and by weaving garlands (for use in the temples ); (4) if not competent to do (3), to meditate on the meaning of Dvaya; (5) if not competent to do (4), to seek the good will of some Śrī Vaiṣṇava who is well disposed to him and would look upon him as his follower and spend his life with him,

PITFALLS IN THE PATH OF THE PRAPANNA:

The man who is qualified to live in this way has to avoid pitfalls in front of him by behaving carefully in three matters. "They concern - (1) those who are suitable or favourable (anukula) (2) those who are unsuitable or unfavourable (pratikūla) and (3) those who are neither the one nor the other. The suitable are Śrī Vaiṣṇavas, the unsuitable are those that are the enemies of Bhagavān; those who are neither the one nor the other are those in saṁsāra. The prapanna will rejoice at the sight of the suitable (anukula) as at chandana, flowers and the like and as at moonlight and the southern breeze and (other) beloved objects. At the sight of the unsuitable (pratiküla), he will be full of dread as at the sight of the serpent and the fire. At the sight of those who are neither of these two, he will behave as at the sight of wood or stone and treat them (with indifference), as if they were straw. If they are agreeable, he should impart the knowledge of truth to them ; otherwise, he should pity their sad fate. It is the inclination for wealth and sensual pleasure that stands in the way of such behaviour. If, owing to the desire for wealth and sense pleasures, a man should treat a Śrī Vaiṣṇava with disregard or contempt, he would provoke the wrath of Bhagavān in the same way as a man who treats the prince with disrespect in the presence of the king would provoke the king's anger. If, owing to the desire for wealth and sense pleasures, a man should remain subservient to those who are unsuitable, he would provoke disgust in the mind of Bhagavān in the same way as a queen who, while her lord is an emperor, begs alms of the mean and unworthy would provoke disgust in the king's mind. If a man should treat with respect those who are neither the one nor the other, the Lord would have no regard for him, as his knowledge serves no useful purpose like that of one who cannot distinguish between a gem and a piece of stone",

ŚRĪ RĀMĀNUJA'S ADVICE EXPLAINED:

Io connection with this code of conduct prescribed by Śrī Rāmānuja for the prapanna, we have to remember that the pursuit of wealth and sense pleasures which are against dharma have already been prohibited altogether (for all including non prapannas) as in the following śloka s:- "One should not, in any circumstances and even in critical times, accept any gifts, not even a cowrie, from an unchaste woman, a eunuch, an outcast (patita) or an enemy." "They are dear to me. they who are born blind to the imperfections of others, who are eunuchs in regard to the wives of other men and who are dumb in the matter of censuring others." So the injunction contained in the Bhāṣyakāra's words (really) means that even in regard to the acquisition of wealth and sense-pleasures which are not opposed to dharma, the prapanna should not deviate from his proper state in regard to these three classes of persons, the suitable, the unsuitable and those who are neither of these two. That those who are suitable should not be treated with disregard is declared in Śāṇḍilya smṛti (4-86). “A householder does not like one who treats his son with disregard; so also Bhagavān does not like those who do not treat his bhaktas with due respect." That those who are unsuitable should not be associated with, is declared in the Mahābhārata   : “Those who hate Keśava, the Supreme Being, and cannot, meditate on Him - to them and to those who associate with them with respect, there will be no benefit at all from bathing in the holy waters". So also it is said: "One should not associate with fools, with those who are addicted to sin, with those who are cruel by nature, and with those who criticise adversely the śāstras of Bhagavān (Pāñcarātra). Association with them will put an end to bhakti". That those who are neither the one nor the other should be treated like straw is well known from ślokas like the following:- "O men of the world, from this day onwards, you are what you are and we are what we are. You are in quest of wealth and sense pleasures; we are in quest of Nārāyaṇa.  (So) there cannot be any companionship between you and us. We are the servants of the Lord; you are the slaves of the senses". The words that the prapanna should walk warily (lest he should fall into pitfalls) indicate that the (five) services ordained as essential by the Bhāṣyakāra (in his words quoted above) stand in the same category as services like Sandhyāvandana which can be learnt only from the śāstras and that, for that reason, these five, too, should be done in accordance with the injunctions prescribed in the śāstras, in order that they may become real and proper services. It may be asked: ("How can his (Śrī Rāmānuja's) words be interpreted to include also those rites and duties that are prescribed in the śāstras and that these five services which he has specifically mentioned should also be done according to the śāstras?") The answer is that it is clear from the Bhāṣyakara's words "If he should go about doing as he likes, it would be against his svarūpa or essential nature." As Aḷavandār puts it, "Whatever agrees not with the śāstras is Āsuric in nature; those sections that are opposed to the śāstras are inconsistent with his Nature which is godly". Further it has been said by the Lord who is entitled to our service - "The śruti and the smṛtis are indeed my commands. He who transgresses them violates my commands. He does injury to me. Though he may be devoted to me he should not be called a Vaiṣṇava". Śrī Rāmānuja's meaning is that, since the Master has also made this declaration, the prapanna should serve in accordance with the śāstras as long as he lives in the body. In his Gītārtha Sangraha Aḷavandār says : - "From the karmas pertaining to one's varṇa and āśrama to bhakti yoga, one should perform everything, directed by love alone (of the Lord). One should give up the notion that these are upāyas or means (for attaining one's ends). One should place the upāya without fear on God; (i.e) one should realise that Bhagavān is alone the upāya)". It is obvious that 'by love alone' excludes the notion that it is an upāya owing to the word 'alone' and this idea is elaborated in "having given up the notion that these are upāyas or means". It is true that the love (of the Lord) is indicated as having a wonderful power of inspiring one to service prescribed in the śāstra. But in the words "from the karmas pertaining to one's varṇa and āśrama", it is shown that the nature of these karmas has to be ascertained only from the śāstras.

This ordinance imposed by the śāstras is well known from the following ślokas in the chapter on prapatti : " In order that there may be no violation of dharma, for the protection of the family, for keeping ignorant men in the right path by setting them an example, for the preservation of the moral law as defined in the śāstras, for my (Lakṣmī 's ) satisfaction and for the satisfaction of the Lord armed with Sarnga who is the God of all gods, the prapanna who is wise should aot even think of transgressing the ordinances of the Veda". The evil that would result from the transgression is described immediately afterwards as follows : “Even a king's favourite, who, because it serves no purpose of his own, destroys the bund of a river dug by the king's orders, which is of great use to the world, is beautiful in itself and causes abundance of crops, - even he will be impaled for having done so ; So also though he may be dear, the man who violates the ordinances of the Vedas is no favourite of mine inasmuch as he violates my commands.” If, having offended the Lord, the prapanna does not seek pardon, it will produce, before he attains mukti, some evil or other in accordance with his specific qualification.

That apart, there is no greater hell (for the prapanna) than the displeasure caused to Bhagavān. This displeasure of Bhagavān will disappear if he obtains pardon. (As the Gita says) Iśvara, by His very nature, is full of love to all. So till His displeasure disappears, it will give the prapanna excruciating pain. If the man has no such pain, his devotion to the Master and his desire for rendering service after mokṣa  have to be doubted.

Since this violation of the Lord's command is opposed to the Lord's pleasure which is our final goal as stated in the śloka  : "When shall I, Thy servant, look upon Thee alone as my Master and give Thee delight by rendering service ?" the observance of the ordinances of the śāstras has to be understood in those places in the three mysteries (mantras) where the removal of obstacles is referred to. In the case of those who have not completed their adoption of prapatti the upāya, the observance of these ordinances will remove the hindrances or obstacles to the completion of prapatti and win for them the grace of the Lord. In the case of those whose adoption of the upāya is complete, it will win the favour of the Lord by removing the causes that might bring about His displeasure (in future).

The paths indicated in the śāstras deal with acts or rites of two kinds: obligatory and permissive. The former have to be done for avoiding the Lord's punishment and the latter for obtaining the respective benefits.

Even when a permissible act is performed, if there is violation of the prescribed method, it becomes an offence or violation of the command. Therefore transgression of the rule prescribed in the śastra is nowhere countenanced.

When the same rite is prescribed both for avoiding a transgression and for obtaining a benefit - in that rite, there is a mingling  of competency (adhikāra) according to scholars. When the same karma or rite is prescribed as nitya (obligatory) and also kamya (for the sake of a benefit), the act or rite performed for the specific benefit will serve (also) as the performance of the nitya (by that single performance).

In rites (karmas or services) prescribed for the attainment of certain benefits, the benefit will not be obtained, when the service is not performed, but there is no transgression. Such is the opinion of competent scholars.

By following the four Vedas (and the Smṛtis and other śāstras) in which the Supreme Being who measured the three worlds with His feet has ordained what is right and what is wrong, we have attained the state of service similar to that of the eternal sūris who are full of the love (of God). To us who live in the dark night (of saṁsāra), there is no other light than that of this moon (viz. the śāstras) to dispel the darkness that grows denser and denser at every step.

The wise man learns what is in accordance with the will of the Ruler who is the originator of the Universe [may mean also 'the Primaeval Ruler'] ; from the śrutis ; from the Smṛtis ; and from the traditional practice of elders ; from the promptings of his own reason in the case of the man with a pure heart; from good resolutions not departing from dharma; and also the traditional practice of the family, of the charana

[ the acharas which pertain to the respective veda to which the man belongs.] and of the country. Sometimes he tries to understand the Lord's will from the commands of those who are competent to direct him and also from omens, signs, dreams and the like.
