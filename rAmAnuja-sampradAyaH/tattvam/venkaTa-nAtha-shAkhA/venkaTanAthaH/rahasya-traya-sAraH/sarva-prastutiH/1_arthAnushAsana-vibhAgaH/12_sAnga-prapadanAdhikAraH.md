When a desired object is incapable of attainment by oneself and by other upāyas,  
prapatti is the placing of the responsibility or burden of securing it in somebody who is capable of doing so  
with a request or supplication.  
It is declared to be the specific thought such as (the following):  

> "This object should be accomplished (for me) by you  
without my making any effort of my own hereafter."

THE NATURE OF THE AṅGĪ:

In this upāya ( consisting of angł and aṅgas ) to be adopted by the seeker after mokṣa , the angī is the surrender of one's self or ātmā with a clear understanding, neither in the prapatti nor in the fruit thereof, one has any independence; it should be in the same way as one would surrender a jewel belonging to another to that person himself to be kept safe by him and to be worn by him.

That is ;--- one should realise that, in relation to the Lord of all who appears in the base and the suffix of the first letter in the praṇava (i.e.) a which means Iśvara and the suffix of the dative or fourth case which has been dropped (i.e.) aya (for the Lord of all) as the protector of all and the śeṣī  of all, one has no interest or connection at all in the activity of protecting one-self or those related to one-self and also in what results from the protection of oneself and those related to oneself, either as depending upon one self or as bringing about some results for oneself. It is the specific form of thought that one is śeṣa to the Lord and is entirely dependent upon the Lord - in this, the most important feature is surrendering the responsibility of protection (bharanyāsa) to the Lord.

## THE MANNER IN WHICH BHARANYĀSA SHOULD BE PERFORMED:

The manner in which this form of mental realisation contained in the injunction "One should surrender one's self to me" should be effected is as follows:- The person should realise this within himself: viz., "I am absolutely dependent (upon the Lord); I am His śeṣa and exist only for Him. My śeṣatva does not belong to anybody else and has no dependence on anybody else. Therefore Iśvara who is the śeṣī  and who is independent should protect me for the fulfilment of His own purposes. As is said in the śloka  : "Even myself or ātmā does not belong to me; (if a man should consider what does not belong to him as his, he could consider the whole earth as his )'; my soul does not belong to me, it does not belong to anyone else (than Bhagavān), I do not belong to myself, nor can I say that any thing belongs to me unconditionally. As stated in the śloka  -" The embodied being who is like a lump of clay and is entirely dependent on the Lord) is not able to protect himself; how can he protect others ?', I am incapable of protecting myself and those who are said to be mine, independently (of the Lord) or for the sake of myself as the main person interested in it." Just as the wise Uparicharvasu always felt that his soul, his kingdom, his wealth, his wife, and his vehicles were all for Bhagavān, we should also say, "I and what is mine are His. The responsibility of protecting these is also that of the Lord who is the universal Protector" for it is said : " the surrender of the responsibility for one's self and of what is one's is called atmanikṣepa." " There is no one other than Bhagavān who is capable of affording protection ". The fruit of this protection should also be considered primarily His, for it has been said, "Ātmanikṣep consists (also) in giving up all relationship to the fruit resulting from His protection and surrendering it (viz the fruit) to Keśava "who is the chief beneficiary".

</details>

To all seekers of mokṣa  (whether bhaktas or prapannas), the surrender of one's svarūpa or self and the rest (i.e) the fruit in common. To one who has no other upāya ((i.e.) prapannā) and is therefore akinchand, the surrender of the responsibility of protection (bharanyása ) is an additional aṅgī. To all prapannas, whatever may be the object desired by them, the surrender of the responsibility is cominon. To those prapannas who are desirous of (only) mokṣa , the surrender of one's self or svarūpa and also of the fruit arising therefrom is an additional (requirement).

IŚVARA IS THE PRINCIPAL BENEFICIARY :

If it is asked how, when the Jīva   who performs prapatti as the upāya for the sake of some gain or fruit is the person interested in the fruit, Iśvara becomes the chief beneficiary, the answer is as follows:-Iśvara becomes the chief beneficiary, because, just like the modifications of acit or matter, the benefits (purushārthas) granted by Him to cit (jīva) are pleasing to Him. Being the śeṣī  of all, He is the chief beneficiary. To a man of cultivated tastes, who is not in need of anything, the delight in melting dolls made of metals and shaping them into ornaments and wearing them in admiration of their beauty is not different (in kind) from the delight enjoyed by him in keeping a sentient being like a parrot in a cage and feeding it with milk and seeing it fly according to His pleasure.

Therefore, ātmasamarpanam (the surrendering of the self to the Lord for protection) means here the realisation of the self as existing solely for the purpose of the Saviour and that to such an extent that the self feels no further responsibility, whatever, for its own protection and this should be accompanied by the knowledge that the fruits of such surrender are not one's own. The purport of the śloka  in Aḷavandār's Stotra (52)

“वपुरादिषु योऽपि कोऽपि वा गुणतोऽसानि यथा तथाविधः । तदयं तव पादपद्मयोरहमद्यैव मया समर्पितः”(आळवन्दार् स्तोत्रम् 52.)

which says "Whatever I may be in the body, the senses and the like, and whatever may be the qualities of my Nature, I who know that I am Thy śeṣa hereby surrender myself at this very moment at thy two lotus-like feet" -- the purport of this śloka  is as follows:

If a man has (somehow) come into possession of a cloth bag with the king's seal on it, he would return the bag (to the king), even though he does not know for certain the nature and character of the gem contained within it, in the hope that the king would take it back. So also even those who have not the intelligence to know, with perfect clearness, the nature, character and state of the soul as distinguished from the body may surrender their self or soul with the little knowledge that they possess. If they do so, even for that much, Bhagavān will be prepared to remit the punishment for the theft consisting in making away with one's self (i. e. claiming it as one's own) from beginningless time. This idea contained in the śāstras is what (Aḷavandār) has in mind. In the next *śloka  (53)[^53] it might appear as if he revoked the surrender (made before); but its meaning is only this : Even when a person is bent on surrendering his self without a knowledge of such things as the nature of his self, if he surrenders it with the notion that it is his own, like the presentation to a king of something belonging to oneself, it would not completely put an end to the crime of having stolen one's self. It does not mean that Aḷavandār considered his self surrender made in śloka  52 in accordance with the injunctions contained in the śāstras, as having been made in ignorance.

[^53]: “मम नाथ यदस्ति योऽस्म्यहं सकलं तद्धि तवैव माधव । नियतस्वमिति प्रबुद्धधीरथवा किन्नु समर्पयामि ते॥ आळवन्दार् स्तोत्रम्-५३

However O lord, what can I surrender to Thee, O Madhava, when I know that I and whatever belongs to me are always thine. As I have nothing of my own, I have nothing to surrender, I am only giving Thee what belongs to Thee",

So from these two śloka s, it is clear that the essence of the śāstras which primarily prescribe bharasamarpaṇam as in the words of Aḷavandār (60) "The responsibility of protecting me is also Thine", consists in saying "na mama “It is not mine" and getting rid of the feeling of one's connection (with everything), though one may not have a true and discriminatory knowledge about such things as the essential nature of the self.

## THE MEANING OF THE AÑGĪ IN DVAYAM :

Thus in the first part of the Dvaya which deals with the upāya or means, the surrender to the Lord of the responsibility (for one's protection) accompanied by the thought that one is śeṣa to the Lord and exists only for Him is to be understood in connection with the verb (prapadye) joined with the word śaranam which treats of the upāya preceded by supreme faith ( mahavisvāsa ) and which contains within it, in an implicit form, the supplication for protection.

Thus (from what has been said in this chapter and in the foregoing chapters), although these six (the five aṅgas and the angī) may be understood separately, while considering, in detail, the meaning of each part of the sentence, yet they constitute only a single mental act while understanding the whole sentence, just like the understanding of other sentences having several parts. Therefore, in accordance with the śastras, this principal action with its aṅgas is performed only once.

## PRAPATTI IS A MOMENTARY ACTION.

An archer's action in discharging an arrow for hitting a target may be constituted of several separate acts (like observing the object, taking the aim and discharging the arrow) and yet it is all accomplished in a single moment. Similar is the act of surrendering (to the Lord) the responsibility of (one's) protection. This is evident from the śruti  itself. (The śruti  says, "* Praṇava (aum) is the bow: the soul or self is the arrow; it must be discharged at Brahman, which is the target, with great care and with keen concentration ").

That this surrender of the responsibility of protection (bharasamarpana) should be chiefly thought of while uttering the mantras of prapatti is clearly stated as follows in Satyaki tantra by the Saviour Himself, who undertakes the responsibility: "With this mantra one should surrender one's self to me. The one who has surrendered to me the responsibility of doing what should be done will become one who has done one's duty."

## A BRIEF STATEMENT OF WHAT BHARASAMARPAṆA IS:

In (the performance of) this (angī), the conclusion regarding the adoption of this upāya with its aṅgas is as follows:- it consists in the act of surrendering the responsibility for the protection of one's self preceded by the following:--the giving up of the thought that one is the doer (for it is the Lord that does everything), the giving up of the thought of 'mine' (that there is anything belonging to oneself), the giving up of the fruit of the action, the giving ap of the thought that he himself adopts the means for obtaining that fruit; these must be accompanied by anukūlya saṅkalpa, pratikulyavarjana and the rest and, likewise, reverent bowing down to the succession of gurus and with the utterance of Dvaya. The surrender of the responsibility for the protection of one's self carries with it implicitly the surrender of one's Svarūpa or self and the fruit or gain arising from it. The giving up of the thought that one is the doer will result from the realisation of one's entire dependance on the Lord throughout the existence of the soul. This will make one know that this doership has been vouchsafed to one by the Lord Himself.

The giving up of the thought of "MINE' (mama) and of the fruit (of prapatti) will arise from the knowledge that one, as well as what belongs to one, exists, by one's very nature, solely for the fulfilment of the purposes of Bhagavān alone.

The giving up of the upāya for attaining the fruit (mokṣa ) will result from a knowledge that the prapatti performed by a man for winning the grace of the Saviour cannot directly and immediately be the cause of the main fruit, namely, mokṣa , that

prapatti is non-sentient and, therefore, incapable of possessing the will to grant the fruit and that only Iśvara is the upāya for this fruit (mokṣa ). Since Bhagavān who, out of the love natural to Him, has been the primaeval cause of everything from the time of giving the man the body and the senses to the time of his uttering the Dvaya-since Bhagavān is possessed of the will accompanied by the desire to show His grace and is the immediate and direct cause (of the final fruit, viz. mokṣa ) and since he also stands Himself in the place of the prescribed upāya in the case of the man who is incapable of (adopting) other upāyas, He alone is the upāya for the fruit. The authority for this conclusion is the nature of the object, (namely, Bhagavān) as understood from the śāstra which reveals the Person who has that nature and this authority cannot be challenged by reason.

## NADATHUR AMMĀL'S SUMMARY OF THE MEANING OF PRAPATTI :

The following is a summary of the performance of prapatti with its aṅgas as given by Śrī Nadathur Ammal:

"I have been wandering in saṁsāra by doing, from beginning less time, what is displeasing to Thee. From this day onwards, I will do what is pleasing (to Thee). I will not do what will displease (Thee). I have no capital with which to attain Thee, I have made up my mind to seek only Thee as the upāya. Be Thou my upāya! Hereafter, either in the removal of what is evil or in the attainment of what is good, I have no further responsibility from now onwards". In this the determination to do what is pleasing and abstinence from what is displeasing have to be stated only once as accessories or aṅgas to the upāya. His acting later in accordance with this determination to do what is pleasing etc. will be the result or fruit of the upāya and will last as long as his self lasts. If, in accordance with the words of Śrī Ammal, we take the avoidance of what is displeasing as meaning only the determination to avoid what is displeasing, it is evident that it has to be made only once (i.c at the time of prapatti). It is true that it has been said :-"I have dissociated myself from sins which cast one into saṁsāra." (But it may be explained in this way :-) The avoidance of what is displeasing may meen either having no connection (at all) with it (i.e.) giving it up or the determination to avoid it. In either case, this is, at the first instant, an aṅga and the actual avoidance is the result or fruit of prapatti which follows afterwards. This holds good also in regard to visvāsa or faith.

Doing what is pleasing (to the Lord) and avoiding what is displeasing (in one's life after prapatti) are the result of meritorious deeds done in the past, and also the determination made at the time of performing prapatti.

Therefore wise are they who perform prapatti in order to render faultless service during their life-time and to attain mokṣa  after casting off the body resulting from prārabdha karma,

Our princely ācārya s, who wear the crown of proficiency in the Vedas, have placed us for protection under the feet of the Lord, who, from beginningless time, has resolved, in His great compassion, to save us; they have done so in order that there may be no further responsibility in ourselves (for our protection), by saying to us, "Do not forget the truth that the Lord, who is the soul of the world, will protect you who are related to Him as śeṣa (existing solely for His purposes),"

The horse, the chariot and the charioteer -- the end of the Vedas (the Upaniṣads) shows that the three tattvas, cit, acit, and Iśvara are related to one another respectively like the three mentioned above and have always had varied activities in accordance with their respective nature. In connection with these activities, all the three are of the nature of being the (material) causes; two, cit and Iśvara, are of the nature of doers, and one (1.) Iśvara is alone independent (of all others). Therefore the jīva, the responsibility for whose protection has been undertaken by Iśvara who is the Master, is carefree and has no further responsibility of his own in the matter of his protection.
