## karuNAkara - Introduction 

### 1 EDITOR'S EPIPHYTE

Swamy Desika (1268 AD-1368AD) blessed us with a series of works captioned "Rahasyams ie; Secrets." These are in Manipravala medium i.e. in a mixture of Sanskrit and Tamil. Many of these works are short treatises on the philosophy of Sri Ramanuja. and are grouped under the title Minor Secrets (Chillarai Rahasyams.) These are meant for the disciples in inner circle. 

As they are in an alloy of Tamil and Sanskrit, disciples not knowing Tamil are handicapped to enjoy them in full. Sri Villur Nadadoor Sundararya Mahadesika (born in 1828 A.D.) fitted Sanskrit terms for the Tamil words in them and transformed them into pure Sanskrit works. He also translated pure Tamil Verses in them into simple Sanskrit slokas. 

This is almost like an authentic Sanskrit Commentary protecting the original intact. Authentic because the author Sri Villur Nadadoor Sundararya Mahadesika was one of the close disciples of Sri Navalpakkam Annayarya Mahadesika (born in 1789 A.D.) who did penance in Mahabalipuram and had the darshan of Lord Lakshmee Hayagreeva. It is most accurate also because of the caliber of the author on whom was conferred the title of Mahamahopadhyaya by the Queen of British Empire that was ruling our land then. 

Sri Villur Nadadoor Sundararya Mahadesika has himself explained the object of his taking up this assignment in his introduction to the volume containing Sanskrit version of sixteen minor secrets published by him in grantha in the year 1878 AD .The introduction reads thus:- …

#### English Translation
The original of Swamy Desika and its Sanskrit version by Sri Villur Nadadoor Sundararya Mahadesika for Sampradaya Parisuddhi - first of the sixteen secrets with an English Translation by "yours truly" is now being brought out by Sri Nadadoor Ammal Trust. 

This publication has been sponsored by Shri U. Ve Srirangam (Villur ) Nadadoor S.Venkatachari & brothers and is being published on the eve of the centenary of Shri U.Ve Srirangam (Villur) Nadadoor S.Srinivasachariar being celebrated on 19-09-2009. 

Shri U.Ve Srirangam (Villur) Nadadoor S.Srinivasachariar is the second son of Sri Sundaracharya. Sri Sundararya Mahadesika was the younger brother of Sri Sundaracharyar's father. 

Sri Villur Nadadoor Venkatasesharya Mahadesika (1855 A.D. -1934 AD) "yours truly's" grand father was one of the cousin brothers of Sri Sundararya Mahadesika and was his main disciple. 

Sri U.ve. Villur Nadadoor Asukavisarvabhouma Srinidhi Swamy (1913 A.D-2001A.D) recipient of certificate of honor from Rashtrapathi in 1986 was the son and disciple of Sri Villur Nadadoor Venkatasesharya Mahadesika. 

"Yours truly" is one of the sons and disciples of Sri U. ve. Villur Nadadoor Asukavisarvabhouma Srinidhi Swamy. 

With the above connection as the only prop, "yours truly" has ventured the English Translation of Sampradaya Parisuddhi accepting the assignment given by Sri Nadadoor Ammal Trust. 

Sampradaya Parisuddhi can be translated in English as "Purity of lineage". Evidently Swamy Desika composed this to dispel the doubts in the minds of the "not so sure" ones on credibility of our Spiritual lineage. Swamy Desika resolves apparent contradictions and conflicts in the preaching and practice in our spiritual lineage that make it appear polluted and establishes our lineage as blemishless.

### 2. STUCTURE OF SAMPRADAYA PARISUDDHI 
Following are discussed in this work: 

1. Necessity of learning the nuances of one's religion and philosophy by approaching a duly qualified preceptor in the lineage. 
2. What makes a lineage immaculate?
3. What should be the basis for the classification of preaching as “public (open) and private (secret)?
4. Is there any quarrel among the scriptures of our lineage?
5. Is there any quarrel between preaching and practice in our religion? 
6. How was the message of Vedanta spread in earlier Yugas?
7. Nammazhwar becoming the origin for our spiritual lineage in the beginning of this Yuga. Acceptability of this to the scriptures.
8. No contradiction in the various interpretations given to
   Ashtaksharam
9. Explaining the Five Fundamentals (Artha Panchakam) in three different ways does not mean contradiction
10. Why Dwayam is called so? Resolving apparent conflicts in its 
various explanations 
11. Sorting out superficial conflicts in the explanations of Charama Sloka. 

[[6]]
 
I would request the readers to enjoy this book with this background in mind.  

I request I may be forgiven for slips in my assignment of preparing the English Version and editing the texts 

I thank Sri U.Ve. Villur Nadadoor S.Seshadri Swamy,Managing Trustee of Sri Nadadoor Ammal Trust for giving this opportunity to me. My thanks are also due to Sri U.Ve.Vidwan Dr. Yamunacharyar for his preparing the Sanskrit text in Devanagari Script from Grantha Scripts and Sri Murali of Versatile Printers for neat execution of this work.

Opening Tamil Verse-An Executive Summary of Sampradaya Parisuddhi! 
The consort of Lakshmee - who is worshipped by the eternally emancipated accompanying Him in His heavenly abode blessed us with a mind that is firmly attached to the matchless lineage of the learned and virtuous preceptors possessing factual knowledge and kindness. Because of this, we are in the path that takes us to Him. He showers mercy on us treading in this path as if it were His responsibility to eradicate our sorrow concomitant with birth and feels happy. We are, therefore, surely in an enviable status.

[[9]]
 
सदाचार्य सम्प्रदायेन अध्यात्मशास्त्रार्थविशेषनिर्णयः कार्यइत्येतदुपनिषत्सु उपब्रह्मणेषु च प्रसिद्धम् । 
1. It is clear from Upanishads and the texts explaining them, that analysis of the concepts of the scriptures to arrive at the appropriate conclusions should be on the basis of the lineage of the virtuous preceptors. 
“ 
"" 
2. சாஸ்த்ரார்த்த நிரூபணம் பண்ணுமி டத்தில் சக்தியில்லாதவர்களுக்கு "உபதேலாத்தரிம் புத்வா” என்கிற படியே சாஸ்த்ரஜ்ஞ ஸம்ப்ரதாயமாத்ரமும் அபேக்ஷிதார்த்த நிர்ணாயகமாம்.

2. There are those not possessing the capacity to analyze the scriptures. Just following the preaching of the learned preceptors would serve the purpose for them. There are texts saying “After realizing Hari on the basis of preaching....." and many others akin to them in support of this stand. 
3. ஸத்ஸம்ப்ரதயாய ரஹிதமான சாஸ்த்ரத்தால் அர்த்தநிர்ணயம் துஷ்கரம்; ஸுகரந்தானாகிலும் உபயுக்தமாகாது. 
सत्सम्प्रदायरहितेन शास्त्रनिर्णयो दुष्करः । अथ सुकरोऽप्युपयुक्तते न भवति । 
3. Even for those capable of analysis, it is not easy to arrive at appropriate conclusions without the support of the 
[[10]]
 
lineage of the virtuous preceptors. Even if it were easy, such analysis will not be useful. 
4. அத்யந்தம் அதீந்த்ரிய விஷயத்தில் சாஸ்த்ர மூலமல்லாத ஸம்ப்ரதாயமும் ஸம்ப் ரதிபந்ந சாஸ்த்ர விருத்தமான ஸம்ப்ரதாயமும் ப்ரம-விப்ரலம்ப-ஸம்பா வாநையுண்டாகையால் பாஹ்ய துல்யமாகையாலே அவிச்வஸநீயம்.

4. In matters far beyond the reach of our faculties, neither the lineage without back up of the scriptures nor the lineage not in harmony with the scriptures is acceptable because of the possibility of deviation and delusion. They will be as unreliable as the lineage foreign to the Vedas. 
5. பரஸ்பர விருத்தமாக ஸதஸ்யமும் ரஹஸ்யமும் என்று சொல்லுமவையிரண்டும் ஸ்வவாக்கியத்தாலே பாதிதங்களாம். திரளிலே சொல்லுமவை ஸதஸ்யம். சில அர்த்தங்களை ஏகாந்தத்தில் சொல்ல விதிக்கையாலே அவற்றை ரஹஸ்யமென்கிறது.

5.a. There a few who preach some concepts in public labeling them "Public" and preach a few other contradicting them in private labeling them "Secret". Such concepts get nullified by the mutual contradiction by the very own words of such preachers. 
[[11]]
 
5.b. It is laid down, that even ofthe concepts preached in Public, deeper aspects of the same, not in any way contradicting the utterances made in public, have to be presented to selected disciples in privacy only. Such aspects of the concepts alone are worth to be termed "Secrets" 
6. ப்ரஜாபதிவாக்யம் முற்பட அஸுரேந்த்ரனான விரோசனை மோஹிப்பிக்கைக்காகச் சொல்லப்பட்டு, பிற்பட தேவேந்த்ரனைப் பர்வக்ரமத்தாலே பரிசுத்த ஆத்ம விஷயத்திலே ப்ரதிஷ்டிதபுத்தியாக்குகிறது. 
प्रजापतिवाक्यं तावत् प्रथममसुरेन्द्रं विरोचनं विमोहयितुं प्रवृत्तं, अनन्तरं देवेन्द्रं पर्वक्रमेण परिशुद्धात्मविषये प्रतिष्ठितबुद्धि கங் 
6. It is seen in Chandyogya Upanishad that Brahma taught Virochana, leader of Asuras and Indra, leader of Devas, who had gone to him to know what is soul. Brahma preached to both in such a fashion that the preaching identified soul as nothing different from body. Virochana believed the same and spread it among his friends. Indra had however his doubts .He stayed back and sought clarifications from Brahma. Then Brahma taught him the true aspects of Soul. Does not this amount to contradiction between Public and Private preaching? 
No.Brahma wanted to eliminate the unfit student and teach the fit one step by step so that he got clear idea of the Soul embedded in his mind. 
7. உபகோஸல வைச்வாநராதி வித்யை களிலே முற்பட வேத்யோபாதேயங்களைப் பற்ற ஏகதேயோப- தேயம் க்ரமேண சேஷபூரணார்த்தம். 
[[12]]
 
उपकोसलवैश्वनरादिविद्यासु प्रथमं वेद्योपादेशेष्वेक- देशोपदेशः क्रमेण शेषपूरणार्थः । 
7. In Upakosala Vidya and Vaiswanara Vidya, means of meditation of Supreme Soul also, preaching of a portion first and then detailing the same is to present the concepts step by step. 
8. ஸர்வவேச்வரன் தானும் தான் உபதேசித்த ஜ்ஞானத்தைப் பின்னையும் 'தத் வித்த்தி ப்ரணிாபாதேந பரிப்ரஸ்னேந ஸேவயா" என்று பல ஞாநிகள் பக்கலிலே கேட்க விதித்தானிறே!. 
सर्वेश्वरोऽपि स्वोपदिष्टं ज्ञानं पुनरपि "तद्विद्धि प्रणिपातेन" इत्यादिना बहूनां ज्ञानिनां सकाशे पृष्टुं व्यदधाद्धि ! 
8. Even Lord Krishna in Geetha advised Arjuna to seek further clarification from the wise by prostrating before them! 9. இப்படிகளால் ஸம்ப்ரதிபந்நசாஸ்த்ர விரோத- மின்றிக்கே சாஸ்த்ரமூலத்வஸம்ப்ரதிபத்தியுண்டான ஸம்ப்ரதாயமே உபஜீவ்யம். 
एभिः प्रकारैः सम्प्रतिपन्नशास्त्रविरोधं विना शास्त्रमूलत्व- सम्प्रतिपत्तिमान् सम्प्रदाय उपजीव्यः । 
9. From the above, it can be seen that the lineage which has the back-up of Scriptures and which does not contradict the scriptures alone will have to be resorted to. 
10. இப்படிப்பட்ட ஸத்ஸம்ப்ரதாயத்தில் தோற்றும் விரோதம் தத்வவிஷயமாகில் தாத்பர்யபேதத்தாலே விரோதசாந்தி யுண்டாம், அநுஷ்டாநவிஷயமாகில் 
[[13]]
 
அநுகுணமாக வ்யவஸ்திதாவ்யவஸ்தித ப்ரக்ரியை யாலே விகல்பம். 
सत्सम्प्रदायेऽवभासमानविरोधः तत्त्व विषयश्चेत् तात्पर्यभेदेन विरोधशान्तिः सम्भवेत्। अनुष्ठानविषयश्चेत् तत्तद्विषयानुगुणं व्यवस्थिताव्यवस्थितप्रक्रियया विकल्पो भवति । 
10. If there were apparent contradictions in explaining certain concepts the quarrel can be eradicated by difference in focus;If it were in performance, the same can be resorted by accepting that there are always alternative methods. 
11. 
ந்யாஸ உபாஸநங்களிலே அதிகாரி பேதத்தை-யிட்டு வ்யவஸ்திதவிகல்பமென்று பார்க் கிலும் பல-ஸாம்யத்தையிட்டுத் துல்யவிகல்பமென்று பார்க்கிலும் விரோ தமில்லை. 
न्यास - उपासनयोः अधिकारिभेदमाश्रित्य व्यवस्थित- विकल्प इत्युक्तेः, फलसाम्यमाश्रित्य तुल्यविकल्प इत्युक्तेश्च न fatu: 11 
11. Bhakti Yoga and Saranagathi are the two means for Salvation.Some say they are fixed alternatives.Some say they are freelexible alternatives.How can both of these be reconciled? 
Simple! They are fixed alternatives in the sense each is adopted by the seekers of fixed nature. Those not capable of performing Bhakti Yoga adopt Saranagathi. 
At the same time both get the same fruits. Viwed from this angle they are flexible alternatives! 
12. ஸர்வலோக ஹிதமான அத்யாத்ம - சாஸ்த்ர ஸம்ப்ரதாயத்திற்கு ப்ரதமப்ரவர்த்தகன் ஸர்வேச்வரன். 
[[14]]
 
सर्वलोक हितस्य अध्यात्मशास्त्रसम्प्रदायस्य प्रथमप्रवर्तकः सर्वेश्वरः । 
12. Spiritual lineage aims at universal welfare. The Lord of the universe is the first founder of the lineage. 
13. மற்றுள்ளாரெல்லரும் அவன் தானேயாதல் சேதநாந்தர முகத்தாலேயாதல் மயர்வற மதிநலமருள, ப்ரவர்திப்பிக்கிறவர்கள். 
अन्ये सर्वेऽपि तेन स्वतो वा चेतनान्तरमुखेन वा अज्ञानं विनाश्य ज्ञानभक्ती दत्वानुगृहीताः प्रवर्तयन्ति । 
13. All others further the lineage with eradication of ignorance and provision of the duo of wisdom and devotion either directly or through any other soul by Him only. 
14. இப்படி அனஸூயாதிகுணயுக்தராய் "ப்ரணிபத்யாபிவாத்ய ச" இத்யாதிகளிற்படியே ஸம்யக்உபஸந்நரான அதிகாரிகளைப் பற்ற யதார்த்த- தர்பபிகளாய் யதாத்ருஷ்ட-அர்த்வாதிகளான வ்யாஸ- போதாயநாதிகளாலே யதாதிகாரம் ப்ரவர்திதமான வேதாந்த ஸம்ப்ரதாயத்திற்கு இந்த யுகாரம்பத்திலே ப்ரஹ்மமநத்த்யாதிகளுக்குப் பின்பு நம்மாழ்வார் ப்ரவர்தகரானார்.

14. Vysa, Bodhayana and other similar personalities had the vision that was factual and were instructing others without 
[[15]]
 
any deviation from the factual aspects in their vision. The Vedic lineage was furthered by them through their instructions according to the qualifications to those having virtues like absence of malice and approaching them properly as Maitreya approached Parasara falling and prostrating at his feet while seeking sermons from him. Saint Satakopa (Nammazhwar) became the propagator of this Vedic lineage in the dawn of this yuga after the period of Brahmanandi and others. 
15. ப்ராப்யம் ஞானம் "ப்ராஹ்மணாத் க்ஷத்ரி- யாத்வா வைஸ்யாத் சூத்ராச்சாபி நீசாதபீக்ஷ்ணம்" இத்யாதி ப்ரமாண பலத்தாலே மிக்க வேதியர் வேதத்தினுட்பொருள் நிற்கப்பாடி என்னெஞ்சுள் நிறுத்தினான்” என்கிறது உபபந்நம். 
" प्राप्यं ज्ञानं ब्रह्मणात् क्षत्रियात् वैश्याच्छूद्राच्चाभि नीचादभीक्ष्णम्" इत्यादि प्रमाणबलेन ( प्रमाणतम- वेदविद् गूढार्थान् सुस्थिरान्भाषया कृत्वा मच्चिन्तान्ते स्थापयामास) इत्यादि मधुरकविगाथो (धो) प्रपन्ना । 
15. Satakopa (Nammazhwar) was from the Labor Community and so not qualified to spread the vedic concepts through instructions. Is this not a pollution of the lineage? No. It is laid down in scriptures that knowledge may be obtained from members belonging to any of the priestly, military, business, labor or even still lower communities frequently without any reservation. Hence the declaration of Madhurakavi, a Brahmin that Satakopa (Nammazhwar) couched Vedic Concepts - the most authoritative kept well protected by those with knowledge of Vedas -in Tamil in such a way that they stood firm in his mind is in order. 
[[16]]
 
16. வேதாந்தார்த்தவைத்ய ஹேதுவாகையாலே பாஷாந்தரமும் உபஜீவ்யம். 
वेदान्तार्थवैशद्यहेतुत्वात् भाषान्तरमप्युपजीव्यम् । 
16. Sanskrit is the language of Gods. Hence it was the medium of instruction in the Vedic lineage. Satakopa (Nammazhwar) used the medium of Tamil as declared by Madhurakavi his disciple and quoted. Is not this a deviation from and pollution in our lineage? No. Use of any medium as long as it helps to understand the Vedic concepts clearly in one's mind is in order. 
17. தர்மவ்யாத துலாதாராதி வ்ருத்தாந்தங்- களையும் இங்கே அநுஸந்திப்பது. 
धर्मव्याध, तुलाधारादिवृत्तान्तोऽत्रानु सन्धेयः । 
17. Anecdotes of Dharmavyadha a butcher Tuladhara a grocery-vendor and similar personalities belonging to lower communities being approached by even learned Brahmins to get clarification of their doubts have been narrated in Mahabhartha. It would be appropriate to recall them at this point. Hence Madhurakavi a Brahmin approaching "Satakopa (Nammazhwar) a non-brahmin seeking spiritual knowledge is not a deviation. 
፡፡ 
18. "ஸூத்ரயோநாவஹம் ஜாதோ நாதோந்- யத்வதுமுத்ஸஹ” என்கிறது விஷய பேதத்தாலே பரிஹ்ருதம். 
"शूद्रयोनावहं जातो नातोऽन्यद्वक्तुमुत्सहे" इत्येतद्विषयभेदेन 
परिहृतम् । 
[[17]]
18. There is another incidence narrated in the same Mahabharatha. Vidura clears many mundane doubts of Dhritarashtra. When it comes to spiritual matters Vidura declares that as he was born to a lady from labor community, he was not willing to deal on that subject. He calls Sanatsujatha a saint to give sermon on that to Dhritarashtra. So one should take that knowledge other than the spiritual alone can be obtained from any body. 
No. Vidura could arrange a Brahmin preceptor to Dhritarashtra. When no such preceptor could be accessed thre is nothing wrong in getting the knowledge from the knowledgeable irrespective of his community or state.(That is why Ramanuja even after becoming a Sanyasin continued his study under Mahapoorna Goshteepoorna etc; who were still Grahasthas-living with their wives and so considered to be lower in state than a Sanyasin. Brahmatantra Swamy à Sanyasin continued his studies under Swamy Desika, who was a Grahastha only. Vazhuttur Swamy and two other Sanyasins studied under Sri Gopala Desika a grahastha) 
Thus there is no contradiction in the messages obtained from the anecdotes of Dharmavyadha Tuladhara and Vidura in Mahabharatha and that of Madhurakavi .The situations are 
different. 
19. மதுரகவி முதலான ஸம்ப்ரதாய பரம்பரையாலும், ப்ராதுர்பாவவிசேஷத்தாலும் நாதமுனிகளுக்கு ஆழ்வார் ஆசார்யரானார். இவரை ப்ரபந்ந ஸந்தாந கூடஸ்த்- தராமையாலே ஆளவந்தார்"ஆத்யஸ்ய ந: குலபதே: என்று அருளிச்செய்தார்.

एतत्परम्परया प्रादुर्भावविशेषेणच नाथमुनेः शठकोप सूरिराचार्योऽभवत् । इमं प्रपन्नसंतानकूटस्थतया यामुनाचार्यः 
[[11]]
19. Nathamuni meditated on Satakopa (Nammazhwar) chanting Kanninunsiruttambu -the eleven versus in Tamil composed by Madhurakavi learning them from a scion of Madhurakavi.Thus he had a contact with Satakopa (Nammazhwar) through the linege of Madhurakavi. Pleased by his meditation Satakopa (Nammazhwar) appeared before Nathamuni, gave him the four thousand Tamil Verses of all the twelve Azhwars and instructions in spiritual science including in the system of Surrender at His feet for emancipation. Thus Satakopa (Nammazhwar) became Nathamuni's Guru. 
Thus Satakopa (Nammazhwar) became the origin for all performing surrender at His feet for emancipation. That is why Alavandar, grandson of Natahamuni, decared Satakopa (Nammazhwar)as the founder of dynasty of those performing surrender at His feet for Salvation.

20. It is seen from the narrations available to us that Nathamuni himelf did not initiate his grandson Alavandar but had directed his disciples and their disciples to do so as and when Alavandar evinced interest. Why did he advise so? There are three messages for us in this advice of Sri Nathamuni. They are: 
1. Sons, grandsons and similar others connected with one's preceptor are to be preferred while transferring knowledge, 
2. Those senior to one in the spiritual lineage are to also to be respected like the preceptors themselves and 
3. Knowledge transferred to a disciple without his longing for the same may not stay fixed in the disciple's mind.

21. It has been narrated that Sri Manakkal Nambi, grand disciple of Sri Nathmuni, was offering for long green leaves to the chef of Sri Alavandar who had become a chieftain at an early age and so not easily accessible to him to get his attention.And when he got the attention of Sri Alavandar he created interest in him and then initiated him.Is it proper for a preceptor to take such crazy steps.? 
Sri Manakkal Nambi's actions are in order only and they demonstrate the following: 
1. One should do some little service to even the blood 
-descendants of his preceptors 
2. One should execute the orders of the preceptors 
without undue delay. 
3. One may, depending on prevailing times, initiate a disciple without prolonged testing by gradual and repeated instructions.

22. Well. But it is seen that Sri Alavandar started his prayer-songs by paying homage to Sri Nathamuni his grand preceptor only (not mentioning his direct and immediate preceptor Sri Manakkal Nambi). He also took asylum at the feet of the Lord quoting his connection to Sri Nathamuni as the later's grandson again not mentioning his connection wih his immediate preceptor Sri Manakkal Nambi. Is this not improper on the part of Sri Alavandar as a disciple? 
No. It is proper only. Because 
(1) Paying homage to Sri Nathamuni and quoating his connection will certainly please Sri Manakkal Nambi. After all one's aim in paying homage to his preceptor is to please him only. 
(2) Sri Alavandar got the connection of Sri Manakkal Nambi and the wealth of knowledge only because of his birth in Sri Nathamuni's family.So Sri Alavandar wanted to show his gratitude to Sri Nathamuni. 
tie (3) Grand preceptors and their preceptors are also to be 
respected with gratitude like immediate preceptor.

24. It is narrated that Sri Periya Nambi a fully equipped and complete personality therefore called by the name Poorna accepted Sri Ramanuja as his disciple at the command of Sri Alavandar, his preceptor. Then he directed Sri Ramanuja to learn meanings of secret Mantras from Sri Thirukkottiyur Nambi a fellow student of his. Similarly he directed Sri Ramanuja to study Thiruvaimozhi from Sri Thirumalai Andan another class-mate of his. He advised Sri Ramanuja to get sermons and advice from One Sri Azhwar Thiruvarangapperumal Arayar another of his classmates also. Is it proper on the part of a complete personality like him to shunt his disciple from pillar to post like this? And also Does it not make a dent on the single minded devotion of a personality like Sri Ramanuja? 
No. It is laid down in the scriptures that one should obtain knowledge from many and in various modes. There are statements in the epics made by eminent characters that they had approached many knowledgeble elders and worshipped them. Sage Suka was deputed to study under Janaka by Veda Vyasa his father cum preceptor. Going by all these,Sri Peria Nambi deputed Sri Ramanuja to other teachers with the intention of sharpening the disciple in many ways. Hence Sri Peria Nambi's deputing Ramanuja to other teachers is therefore, in order only.

25. Sri Ramanuja was a personality alert ever to tread in the path of the noble. Tradition has it that even when he was too old to follow the religious codes he did not bud an inch and he followed the codes to the letter and spirit till his last btreath. His having approached other teachers chosen by his principal preceptor also to obtain additional knowledge at his command only goes to illustrates the spirit of the scriptures that one should gather wisdom from other sources acceptable to his principal preceptor as per the directions of the principal preceptor.

28. OK. Let this be in order. But under such circumstances how should one treat the persons giving additional input? 
When many persons teach to one single student to register firmly in his mind the main aspects already learnt by him from a preceptor, the student has to respect them also as his preceptors. For it has been laid down in the scriptures thus:- 
One may teach a minor or major aspect. Even he has to be respected as preceptor for help has been provided by him to enhance knowledge.

31. Let it be so. But there are instances of one getting introduced to a preceptor through some good persons. And there are the authors from whose writings ie; literature one gets additional inputs in the spiritual field. How should one treat them? 
[[27]]
Those who introduced one to the main preceptor and those who had helped indirectly through literature on spiritual matters are also to be revered with gratitude..

[[28]]
 
it not amount to division among you and is it not a blur to your Sampradaya?

36. This appears to be over simplification. There are distinct differences while performing religious rites. How then can one deny division among the followers of the disciples of Sri Ramanuja and the consequent blur? 
Differences in the way of performing religious rites can be due to the atmospheric conditions of one's place of dwelling (as in the biting winter of Badari and single season of summer in Tamilnadu ), times and the individual's physical conditions like age, health etc. The scriptures based on which the rites are being performed have accepted such differences. That does not amount to division and blur at all.

37. You are saying so. But there are the ones who claim that there is difference and their preceptors who were also the disciples of Sri Ramanuja had taught them so. How then can one accept your view? 
Such claims from those who are not well informed are based on their own whims and fancies. They will recoil on themselves. Their attributing those to their elders is akin to those who accused Sage Mandavya with burglary just because the burglars ran into his hermitage to hide when police chased them.

38 & 39. There appears to be different ways of interpreting even the basic mantra the eight lettered 
[[30]]
 
Ashtakshara among the followers of the disciples of Sri Ramanuja.There are three words in this Mantra. Some say while chanting the Ashtakshara one should visualize the three words combined to present the five essentials to be understood by each Sri Vaishnava aspiring Salvation. These are 
(1) Brahman -the Lord -the goal to be reached. 
(2) The sentient self aspiring to reach Him. 
(3) The barrier between the two. 
(4) The means to thrash the barrier between the two and 
(5) The fruits the self enjoys after reaching Him. 
These are grouped as Artha Panchaka. 
Some others say one should visualize Artha Panchaka in the very first word of the mantra which is simply one lettered while chanting the Ashtakshara. 
There are again three letters lurking latent in the single lettered first word. 
Some say one should visualize Artha Panchaka in the very first letter of the first word while chanting the Ashtakshara. 
Are not these contradictory and indicative of division among you?aval 
No. They are not contradictory. They are only contrary. The interpretations of the words in Ashtakshara, taking Ashtakshara as a sentence etc;-all have sprung form the original source of interpretation i.e.; the science of etymology, subsequent elaborations based on it in Pancharatra Agama and the other scriptures of elders. 
[[31]]
 
Accordingly visualizing the five essentials directly from the word's capacity or by circumstance or context can not be treated contradictory. One should visualize the five essentials while chanting the Ashtakshara is the basis. In this, there is only one opinion! 
40. இப்படி ப்ரதம த்விதீய அக்ஷரங்களாலே ஆர்த்தமாகவாதல் ஸாப்தமாகவாதல் Uரண்ய ஸஹதர்ம-சாரினீ ப்ரதிபாதநம் பண்ணு மதுவும் அவ்வோ வாக்ய-விசேஷமூலம். 
एवं प्रथमद्वितीयाक्षराभ्यां आर्थं शाब्दं वा शरण्य सहधर्मचारिणी प्रतिपादनमपि तत्तद्वाक्यविशेषमूलम् । 
40. Some of the Acharyas in the school of Ramanuja have said that the first letter latent in the first single lettered word of Ashtakshara describes, Goddess Lakshmee, Consort of the Lord, and asylum for all, as per the context. Some others have said that the second letter latent in the single lettered first word of Ashtakshara describes Her directly as it is Her name. Is not this a contradiction? 
No. As explained earlier these two views are from the scriptures and are contrary to each other only. 
41.

अवधारणमर्थसिद्धम् । 
[[32]]
[[11]]
 
41. In your hurry to prove there is no contradiction you accepted the second hidden letter in the single lettered first word of Ashtakshara describing Goddess Lakshmee is in order. If that were so, will the interpretation that the second letter latent in the single lettered first word of Ashtakshara confirms the souls described by the third latent letter are meant exclusively for the glory of the Lord described by the first latent letter not be lost? 
No. In that case the power of context of description of the divine couple in the first two hidden letters itself will provide the confirmation of exclusiveness. 
42. இந்த அவதாரணத்தாலே ஸ்ரீர ஆத்ம பாவம் ஸித்திக்கிறதென்பார்க்கு சேஷத்வ அயோகவ்யவச் சேதத்திலே தாத்பர்யம் கொள்ளலாம். 
अनेनावधारणेन शरीरात्मभावः सिद्धयतीति वक्तारः शेषात्वायोगव्ययच्छेदे तात्पर्यं स्वीकुर्वन्तु । 
42. How then will you reconcile with the interpretation of some that the confirmation of exclusiveness describes the soul and body relationship between the Lord and the soul? 
The essence of the soul and body relationship is that the body is meant only for the glorification of its soul. If you view from this angle you can appreciate there is no quarrel between the two interpretations.

"मकारार्थो जीवः" इत्यादि प्रकारेण तृतीयाक्षरं जीवजातसर्वपरं इत्यङ्गीकुर्वद्भिरपि स्वानुसन्धानमार्थमिति वक्तव्यम्। 
43. Some have held that the third letter in the first word refers to all that come under the category of sentiments. In that case the chanting person's visualizing his self while chanting the mantra will be lost. How to reconcile this?. 
Simple. As the chanter is also one among the sentiments default derives his existence for the glory of the Lord. 
44.

44. The same Acharyas have also laid down specifically that while chanting the Astakshara one should visualize his very existence is for Him. In this visualization the chanter is loosing sight of the fact that all the souls are for Him. How can you reconcile with us? 
The visualization in that instance will have to be that like him the chanter all souls have same aspect of existence. for His glorification. 
45. பகவத்சேஷத்வம் தோற்றுமிடல்லாம். பாகவத சேஷத்வ பர்யந்தமாக அநுஸந்திக்க ப்ராப்தமாயிருக்க ஒளசித்ய-அதிபயத்தாலே மத்யமபதத்திலே இத்தை அநுஸந்திக்குமது உபபந்நம்.

भगवच्छे षत्वप्रत्यायकस्थले सर्वत्र भागवतशेषत्व- पर्यन्तानुसन्धाने प्राप्तेऽपि औचित्यातिशयेन मध्यमपदे तदनुसन्धानं उपपन्नम् । 
45. The fact that the soul is meant for the glorification of the Lord is concomitant with the fact that soul is meant for the glory of His devotees too. That is why it has been laid out that whenever one visualizes the soul's existence for the service of the Lord he should visualize his existence for the service of devotees too. But some have said that the aspect of souls being meant for the devotees should be contemplated while chanting the second word of Ashtakshara .Is not this contradiction? 
Though the concepts are concomitant stressing the aspect of the existence of the soul for the glorification of His devotees while chanting the second word appears more appropriate. For in this word the souls' existence only for Him and not for its self is established. "Being His" means being "His devotees"" also, for then only being His will be beyond any doubt. Hence the appropriateness of the visualization of the chanter being for His devotee's while chanting the second word.

प्रमाणानुगुणवाक्यार्थविवक्षाभेदेनोक्ते । 
46. It is seen there are two datives - affixes in the Ashtakshara. The first affix is hidden and is on the first of 
[[35]]
 
three letters amalgamating in to the single letter forming first of the three words of Ashtakshara. This first affix hidden over the first letter in the first word, it is told, informs that the souls represented by the third letter are only for the glory of Narayana represented by the first letter. 
The second dative- affix is at the end of the third word of Ashtakshara. It is explicit as the word Narayana is. This dative-affix is also explained as stressing the existence of Souls only for His sake. Does not this amount to grinding the ground? 
To avoid this criticism, some others are putting forth another approach running thus:-. The first affix describes the soul defining it as the object meant for His glorification. When the soul realizes this, it would automatically perform surrender at His feet to get it in to its natural state of serving Him without any interruption in His eternal abode. This aspect is spelt in the second word of Ashtakshara. This will lead, without failure, the soul to His eternal abode where it will be serving and glorifying Him forever. This stage is presented by the second dative -affix. 
Is it fair to give the same dative affix two different interpretations in the first and third words of the same Ashtakshara? 
The first objection of grinding the ground will not arise at all, if one realizes reiterating is a necessity when the concept is not easy to comprehend. 
The second objection that different interpretations are given for the same affix in the same text is also untenable for the followers of the disciples of Ramanuja have not given these independently. They are given so in the texts of authority themselves.

47. We find the word “Srimannarayana” being uttered in the first and second parts of Dwaya Mantra. It is being told by the preceptors of your system that the term "Srimannarayana" in the first part describes Goddess Lakshmee and Her Consort Narayana as having a particular set of virtues and the same term in the second part describe them possessing another set of virtues. Is this not twisting the text? 
No. It is not so. For ease of comprehension and based on need of the context focus is made on certain set of virtues of the divine couple. It does not mean they are devoid of the other sets of virtues. They are still there. But the focus is not on them in that context. 
The first part of Dwaya Mantra presents the divine couple as the Means for salvation. The second part presents the divine couple as the target of service ie; the fruit enjoyed by the emancipated. Accordingly they are to be contemplated with focus on their virtues that establish them as means and fruits respectively.

48. It is seen that in the first part of Dwaya Mantra focusing the means for salvation the uttering is "I take as asylum the feet of Srimannarayana". In the final instruction of the Lord in Geetha acclaimed as Charama Sloka, the uttering is "one should take the Lord (Srimannarayana) Himself as asylum”. Does it not appear that there are two different means that are already available (1) the feet of Srimannarayana and (2) the Lord (Srimanarayana) Himself? Is not this contradicting with the declaration that the Lord (Srimanarayana) alone is the means already available to the aspirer of Salvation? 
If the feet were the means to be taken in addition to Srimannarayana like the devotion or surrender unto Him, then will not the declaration that either devotion or surrender unto Him alone is the means to be performed by the aspirant for emancipation also get contradicted? 
No. Asylum unto His feet means asylum unto Him only as feet cannot be comprehended without Him and is a figurative expression and the argument is by taking the literal meaning. This answers the second query as feet not in anyway does not substitute the devotion or surrender whose performance alone will please Him and make Him condone our sins like on performance of apex expiation.

49. There is the word "Namaha" in the tail end of Dwaya. This also is the second word in Ashtakshara. While explaining the meaning of Ashtakshara the followers of the disciples of Ramanuja have explained it to mean surrender. While explaining the same word it is interpreted as to mean eradication the feelings of "I "and "Mine" Or attitude of doing things for self's happiness. Is it proper to give different meanings for the same word? 
Texts of Authority like Ahirbudhnya Samhita etc; have listed various meanings for the word "Namaha". What is wrong if the meaning appropriate to the context is taken from the above for the same word to understand the mantras in their proper perspective?

39. 
 
considered as a means for emancipation. You are saying the Lord will not give salvation without surrender. Is not this a major difference among the followers of the disciples of Ramanuja? 
No. There is no difference. Both of us say the same. There are two aspects in the means for Salvation. One is the already existing one. i.e.; ready-made means that is the Lord. Srimannarayana. The other is surrender to be performed by the aspirant for Salvation. The ready-made part of the means, Lord Srimanarayana grants salvation pleased by performance of Surrender. So one cannot take surrender as a "privilege" but needs to appreciate that it is only a means for pleasing the Lord. Srimannarayana alone grants salvation. (It is of course a different matter that surrender to Him will never fail to please Him). To stress this aspect only, some followers of the disciples of Ramanuja have said, "He alone is the means for Salvation" They have gone to the extent of declaring surrender as no means for salvation. These are statements to emphasis His importance as means and are hyperbolic only.

51. In Dwayamantra, which is the mantra used to perform surrender at His feet for emancipation, the chanter utters, “I 
[[40]]
 
perform surrender at the feet of Srimannarayana. The verb in the sentence is in the present tense. From this it appears performance of surrender can never become a past event ie; performance of surrender is a continuous act. 
But the followers of the disciples of Ramnuja hold that Surrender for emancipation has to be performed only once. Is not this a contradiction with the utterance in the mantra? 
No. The scriptures introducing surrender lay down that surrender is to be done only once. Sri Rama it is reported in Ramayana the treatise on Surrender therefore called Saranagati Veda by Sage Valmeeki that He would protect all those performing surrender to Him once. Lord Krishna also advises Surrender but does not specify the number of times it should be performed. So it has to be only once. Going by all these it is clear that the present tense in the Mantra indicates the sole occasion of performance of Surrender.

52. But how do you explain some from your own school taking the stand that surrender has to be repeated as daily routine till one's last breath? 
They are to be understood to insist on the tension free living chanting the Dwaya Mantra without any interruption understanding its meaning as per the directives of Lord

Ranganatha to Sri Ramanuja as recorded by Sri Ramanuja in his Saranagati Gadyam. 
53. ந்யாஸ: பஞ்ஜாங்க ஸம்யுக்த: என்று சொன்ன ப்ரபத்தி அங்கங்களிலே சிலர் கதிபயாநாதரம் பண்ணுமது அங்கியுனுடைய வைபவார்த்தம். 
न्यासः पञ्चाङ्ग सम्युक्तः इत्याद्युक्तप्रपत्त्यङ्गेषु केषाञ्चित् कतिपयानादरोऽपि अङ्गिनः वैभावार्थ: । 
53. We are told surrender has following five components: 1. Determination to do only those things that are 
acceptable to the Lord. 
2. Discontinuing those that are against His 
commandments. 
3. Beleiving firmly that the Lord would protect. 4. Choosing Him as Protection. 
5. Realising that one has no other alternative. 
We find there are certain statements from some of the followers of Sri Ramanuja that ignore some of the components. Does this not amount to contradiction? 
No. Their aim is to show the greatness of Surrender the whole in comparison to its parts. Is not Team more important than its Members?

[[42]]
 
54. We also come across statements from some focusing only on a few of the five. Is not this contradiction? 
No. Some components do play a more important role than others. Accordingly they get attention.

चरमश्लोके विधीयमानप्रपत्तेः सर्वफलसाधनतया तां अङ्गभूतां स्वतन्त्रां व्याकुर्वतां भाष्यगद्यादीनां न विरोधः । 
55. It is found Ramanuja interprets in His Commentary to Bhagawad Geeta the Charama Sloka of Lord Krishna in Bhagawad Geeta as prescription for performing surrender as an auxiliary to and component of Bhakti Yoga the means for pleasing Him to get emancipation thus making us to understand that Surrender is only an indirect means to Salvation. He interprets the same Charama Sloka as prescription of Surrender as direct means to Salvation. Is not this Contradiction? 
No. Surrender is a panacea. It can be prescribed therefore as direct or auxiliary means to emancipation. 
56. ஸர்வ தர்ம சப்தத்தில் ஸங்குசிதவ்ருத் திகளைக் கொண்ளுமவர்களுக்குப் பரபக்ஷத்திற் போலே ஸர்வ தர்ம ஸ்வரூபத்யாகவிதி விவக்ஷை யில்லாமையாலே ஸ்வதந்த்ராஞானுபாலன விரோத மில்லை.

[[43]]
 
56. There are three words in the first quarter of Charama Sloka. Literally they mean "Having given up all the means prescribed for uplifting the self.... These go with "You take asylum unto me and only me."Some of the followers of Sri Ramanuja say the term "All" here means the three Yogas Karma, Gnana and Bhakti. Thus they shrink the area of operation of the word "All" in the means prescribed for uplifting the self. Some others say that the term "All" means all the chores laid down in His commandments in the form of Vedas and their auxiliary texts and also the three Yogas. Is not this contradiction? 
No. "Giving up all the chores laid down" in the second interpretation means giving up the idea that they are auxiliary to Surrender for Surrender does not need any components other than its own five to be effective. It does not mean stopping of doing them. Our Acharyas have never given them up but they perform them as they are laid down in His commandments. But they are clear in their mind to have given them up as components for making surrender effective. In the first interpretation "giving up the three Yogas" means giving up the feeling that one can perform them well because of the realistion that they are beyond one's capacity. It can thus be seen that "giving up" is a mental process in both interpretations .It goes to strengthen the realistion of the limitations of the seeker. Thus in the ultimate analysis they are in the same spirit and there is no quarrel. 
And nowhere have both recommended giving up the chores as others foreign to Ramanuja's school have done. And so there is no iota of truth in the comment that the Acharyas are suggesting giving up the chores themselves thus confronting with the commandments of the Lord.

57. It is found that the various interpretations by different preceptors in your system amount to a list of six meanings for the words "parityajya" and "ekam" appearing in Chramasloka. Why should there be such a craze for giving so many interpretations? No. The interpretations are in the authentic texts themselves and are not the making of the preceptors. And so there is no question of any craze to give more and more of interpretations. 
58. அவற்றில் புநருக்தி வராதபடி அநுஸந்திக்குமதே வேண்டுவது.

58. In the process of giving many an interpretation we find some interpretations overlapping and resulting in repetition. There also appears to be contradiction between some of the interpretations. Does not this amount to confused approach in your system?, 
One is free to choose the interpretations appealing to him avoiding repetition. Contradictions being apparent can be resolved with deeper study.

59. The Lord is referred to as the object of surrender in objective case by the word "maam". While explaining this he Acharyas have been saying this term describes the Lord with the qualities like easy accessibility etc. Lord the liberator is referred to in the nominal case also in the second half. While explaining this, Acharyas have been saying that this term refers to Him as possessing supremacy that gives Him the powers to achieve what all He wants. The Lord being the same in both occasions is it proper to say He is with some virtues and void of some virtues at the same time? 
One performing surrender with virtues making Him the object worthy for surrender and getting confidence that surrender at His feet will not fail for He is one with all necessary powers. In no way does it mean that He is void of some virtues at any time.

[[46]]
60. Charamasloka came with Arjuna as its target. Lord instructed him to perform surrender and confirmed that He would liberate him. How is it can it be made applicable to all? 
It is true it targeted Arjuna originally. But going by its spirit it is evident that it is applicable to all seeking asylum at His feet.

61. There is assurance of the Lord in Charamasloka that He will liberate those seeking asylum at His feet from all sins. Some followers of the disciples of Ramanuja interpret that the term includes even those sins committed by the refugee even wantonly after taking asylum. Does not this conflict with the Vedic Injunction that the seeker is to retire from all sins committed wantonly and only those done without being aware of the same will not affect him? 
No. There is no confliction at all. They have interpreted thus keeping in mind the fact that the Lord is ready to eradicate even those sins the refugee might commit wantonly after taking asylum if refugee were to seek pardon for them by taking asylum again for that specific purpose. 
62. "மோஷயிஷ்யாமி" என்கிற ஸங்கல் பத்தின் பலம் ப்ராரப்த கர்மாவஸாநத்திலே என்றவர்களுக்கும்,

62. There is the assurance of the Lord in Charamasloka that He would liberate the refugee from all the sins that stand in his way to get liberation. Some followers of the disciples of Ramanuja have interpreted that this liberation will take place only at the end of karmas that have started giving their fruits before the refugee's taking asylum. Some others say that the time of liberation will be the ones chosen by the refugee. Is not this a contradiction? 
No. The time for departure to His abode chosen by the refugee depends on the level of his sensitization on the pains associated with life in the worlds other than His eternal abode. If the refugee wants immediate liberation, surrender with the power it posses in pleasing the Lord will destroy the balance of those sins that have started their operation. If the refugee wants the liberation at the end of the present body then surrender will destroy by its power that portion of the balance of the sins that have started to give fruits but would have continued to operate in births after the fall of the body if the refugee had not taken asylum. Liberation is only at the end of all the sins that have started to give fruits but the end can be as per the choice of the refugee. For surrender has the power to destroy the remaining portions of sins that have started to give fruits depending on the intensity of the desire of the 
[[48]]
 
refugee to get liberated .It can thus be seen that there is no contradiction between the statements that liberation will be only at the end of sins that have started to bear fruits and that liberation will be at the time chosen by the refugee.

63. Lord concludes the Charamasloka in Bhagavadgeeta saying "Do Not Worry". The "worry" here is being explained as Arjuna's worry on account of his inability to take up the path of Bhakthi Yoga to attain emancipation because by its nature Bhakthi Yoga is long, demanding and difficult assignment. Alternatively surrender simple, short and non- demanding was prescribed to remove his worry. This appears to be out of phase with the original text. Arjuna refused to carry on with the war against his kith and kin because of his worry on the war being inappropriate. Lord started His sermon to remove this worry of Arjuna. And so the sermon would naturally to conclude referring to removal of this worry. Is it proper to interpret the "worry" differently? 
A proper study of the text will show that this worry on account of the war resulting in killing the kith and kin was removed by the Lord by explaining to Arjuna that he would 
[[49]]
 
not be killing their souls as they are eternal. Arjuna was not to miss the war because it offered him a good platform to perform Karma Yoga ultimately leading to Bhakthi Yoga. In the process various topics came up for discussion. During the discussion the Lord made reference to the division among men based on the nature of Devas and Asuras. Arjuna got worried whether the Lord would classify him as Deva or Asura.Noting this Lord said "You belong to the category of Devas. Do not worry."Would you like to interpret the word worry here to still mean the initial worry of killing his own kith and kin? You will not because the worry now was on different context. Similarly the worry referred to in Charamasloka is of different nature matching the context.

64. Thus the purity of lineage of ours has been presented in brief by us by resolving various apparent contradictions that are mutual and in their sequence in the presentation of the three parameters: - The Elements (again divided in to three:- The Lord, the soul and the other matter), means for liberation and fruits to be attained by those means as laid down by Upanishads.

It is said in Mahabharatha that "one should gather the good words of the men of wisdom and the good deeds of theirs for following live without tension, like the poor ones that collect grains scattered here and there in the fields for preparing their food". One should keep this advice in mind at this juncture.

65. The Lord, consort of Goddesses of Lakshmee, churned the (Milky) ocean, gathered nectar and distributed the same (to Devas). Our preceptors have shown His feet to us. Appreciating their stand as the best we have accepted them and are following them. 
Our Spiritual lineage has come down from the Lord, the all- knowing & omniscient (who is in the know of every aspect of every thing that existed, exists or will come to exist) to our preceptors blessed by him and so duly qualified. This work establishes that this lineage is unpolluted,

immaculate and is beyond any internal contradiction. And dispels all the doubts that crop up in and confuse our minds. Hence the title "Sampradaya Parisuddhi “(Purity of our Lineage) suits it.
