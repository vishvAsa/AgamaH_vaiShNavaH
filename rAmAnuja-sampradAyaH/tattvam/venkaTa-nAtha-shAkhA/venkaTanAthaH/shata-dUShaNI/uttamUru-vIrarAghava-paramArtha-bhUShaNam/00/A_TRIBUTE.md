+++
When information was received that 'Satabhushani' was published in refutation of the arguments of Sri Vedanta Desika in his ''Sata Dooshani" against the Advaita doctrine, there was generally a stir among the Vaishnavites, who considered it a challenge to their doctrine and Sampradaya and they resolved that a reply should be given. They entrusted the task into the capable hands of Sriman Uttamur Veeraraghavacharya Swami. Subscriptions were also collected. When the work was some way through its progress was retarded by want of sufficient financial assistance, and so an appeal was made to Sri Van SathakopaSri Vedanta Desika Yatindra Maha Desika, (present Alagiya Singar) of Sri Ahobila Mutt. The response was ready and quick and a cheque for Rs.5,000/was received, which eased the situation considerably and helped to the completion of the work. The Visishtadvaitic world is extremely grateful to His Holiness Sri Alagiasingar for his great love of learning and his generous patronage.
