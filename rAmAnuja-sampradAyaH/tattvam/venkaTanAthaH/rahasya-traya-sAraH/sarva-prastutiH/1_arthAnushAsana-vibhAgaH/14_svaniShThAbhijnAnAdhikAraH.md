To a man whose understanding is firmly and properly fixed on (a knowledge of) his essential nature, on the upāya adopted by him, viz. prapatti and on the ultimate aim of life (puruṣārtha), a recognition that he is steadily fixed in this state gives more delight (even) than his approaching mokṣa . For by the might of this knowledge, he is able, with a disciplined mind, to close up the chasms lying before him (as obstacles) which are deep and hard to fill and which are as immense as the sky,

I. Signs or marks regarding niṣṭhā in Svarūpa

How can a man know that he has firm faith or niṣṭhā (in regard to the knowledge of svarūpa?) The answer is as follows: (1) when he is treated with such things as contumely by others, he would be free from sorrow or depression owing to the knowledge that these faults pertaining to the body and the like (ugliness, low birth etc) have no connection (at all) with his essential nature, (2) It has been said:-"When one man' reviles another, the sin of the reviled person passes on to the reviler". So towards these fools that are to receive his sin by their derisive talk, he (the prapanna) should feel overwhelming compassion as stated in such śloka s as the following - "If other created beings harbour enmity and show hatred, the wise man pities them saying, "How wrapped up they are in great delusion!" and "One should very much pity the fool who does evil to himself by violating the śāstras and straying from the right path and who is, therefore, like firewood destined for the flames of hell.” The prapanna

would feel grateful to these revilers as being benefactors who remind him, by their censure, of faults which have been described in Aḷavandār's *śloka [  "How can I ever cross the sea of Sorrow and render service at Thy feet - I who have transgressed all the regulations of the śāstra s who am mean, fickle-minded, cavious, ungrateful, arrogant, lustful, deceitful, wicked and sinful?" ] and in such verses as those of Tirumaṅgai Alvar ["Born into this life, I fell into deep anguish of mind. I mingled with young women thinking it was greatly to be desired, until at last I realised that salvation consists only in the utterance of the name 'Nārāyaṇa”.] as fit to be reflected on in connection with oneself. (4) The prapanna (who has the niṣṭhā in svarūpa) would understand that all souls are dependent on Bhagavān owing to their essential nature, that all jīvas (kṣetrajnas) are under the sway of past karma and that these revilers of his (therefore) revile him by the prompting of Iśvara, who is independent and is the śeṣī  of all and who enjoys the līlā which follows from past karma in the relations between him and his revilers. He would therefore feel no aversion to them: (5) He would rejoice that his past sins which have begun to operate in this life are now being worked out in part. If he has these marks or characteristics as clarified in the explanation of the meaning of the first word (praṇava) and the middle word na mama (namo) in the Mūlamantra, the prapanna may consider that he has realised his difference from acit or matter, that he possesses knowledge which will enable him to act beneficially towards all beings, that he feels his being destitute of upāyas of any kind, that he knows his existing solely for the fulfilment of the purposes of Bhagavān and is entirely dependent on him and should therefore do what is pleasing to the Lord, who, by His very nature, is impartial, who rewards (or punishes), each according to his karma, and who is the independent śeṣī for whom all else exist and that he understands that his good can arise only from the will of another (i.e.) the Lord, as has been pointed out in the s'loka; “Where am I who am so full of evil thoughts? Where is the possibility of my seeking what is good to me? Therefore, O Thou, that controllest the gods! Direct me to do whatever is good for me, O Madhava!"

II THE NISHTĀ CONCERNING UPĀYA :

If, in him, these features that follow are found, the man who has performed prapatti may infer that he is in the proper state in relation to the knowledge concerning the upāya (1) He under. stands that, for him, there is no protection from himself or from others and that Iśvara is his only Protector : (2) Though he is confronted with causes of fear even to the extent of death, he does not bewail his state and feels satisfied as at the approach of what is desirable, for it has been said: "People are 'generally afraid of Death because they have not done what they should have done ; those who have done what they should do expect Death as if he were a welcome guest" (3) He has the perfect confidence of having found a Saviour. Sītā Devi taught this by her example. "The beautiful Sītā, resting on the arm of ŚrīRāma, was not afraid at the sight of the elephant, the lion or the tiger (when she was with him in the forest)" She said to Ravana:-O Thou '(Rākṣasa) with ten heads that deservest to be reduced to ashes! because I have not obtained ŚrīRāma's permission and because I have to cherish my tapas as a pativrată (a wife devoted to her husband), I do not burn thee to ashes by the flame (of my chastity) and likewise, "if Rāma who can destroy the forces of his enemies fills Lanka with his arrows and take me away from here, it will be in keeping with his character." In respect of the object for which he has made bharanyāsa, the prapanna is without any (further) effort of his own (to save himself). In that matter, he realises that the removal of what is evil and the attainment of what is good are in the Lord's hands alone. If he has these features, it may be inferred that he is steadfastly fixed in the upāya which he has sought and which is the means of obtaining all the benefits desired by him, which is prescribed as an upāya in the first half of the Carama śloka , which is to be thought of in the first part of Dvaya and which is implicit also in the middle word of Tirumantra (namo).

III THE NISHTĀ CONCERNING PURUSHĀRTHA:

It has been said:-- "Of the three, your birth, continuance and perishing, why should you be anxious only about your continuance? In the same way as birth and death come of themselves (without any choice being left to you), your continuance in life also will not depend on anything done by you" and again: "The goddess of Lakṣmī comes, of her own accord, to one who does not exert himself in any way. Another man who makes efforts does not obtain even the food (he wants). This is in accordance with past karma". The prapanna whose understanding is firmly fixed in the purushūrtha would not feel anxious in relation to such things as the maintenance of the body.which are directed by Iśvara in accordance with particular acts of past karma that have begun to operate in this life. He would reflect that, even if he grieved or felt anxious about these things, nothing would happen except according to the will of God, as stated in the following passages:- "Though he flies in the air, or enters the lower world, called Rasatala, or wanders about the whole earth, a man will not obtain what is not ordained for him" and again, “Whatever work is done in the world is work done by me. So others propose but I dispose." When things not forbidden in the śāstras come to him without any seeking of his and by the will of God, the prapanna realises that the debt which has resulted from past karma that has begun to operate is now being discharged. Therefore he enjoys them without trying to avoid them. For it has been said in Parāsaragita and elsewhere - "House-bolders should receive whatever comes to them without any exertion on their part. As regards their dharmas, on the other hand, it is my opinion that they should, in all possible ways, exert themselves

and fulfil them”, and so also, “The wise man should not be anxious about his food. He should think only of his dharma. Man's food comes to him along with his birtb." Like-wise it has been stated in Ajagaropakhyāna :-"I do not avoid enjoyments which come to me of themselves and which are also in keeping with (my) dharma nor do I seek any enjoyment which can be had only with painful effort."

The prapanna who has attained niṣṭhā in puruṣārtha has neither pleasure nor pain, when he meets with or fails to get objects usually desired other than mokṣa , as taught in the following śloka s :-"When one of these two, pleasure and pain, arrives, one should not feel delighted on seeing pleasure nor feel sorrow when one sees pain", and "The man who meditates on the feet of the Lord is not elated at the possession of wealth, nor does he feel dispirited when what he possesses is lost." He has, on the other hand, a great longing for service to the Lord which is suited to his essential nature and which is the supreme aim of his life. This urgent longing for the object to be gained will make him cry out as in Aḷavandār's Stotram und in Śrī Rāmānuja's Gadya, "When, when shall I see, face to face, Bhagavān Nārāyaṇa ? When shall I press his two lotus-like feet on my head?" When such conduct and feeling are seen in the prapanna, it may be inferred that his mind is firmly fixed in regard to the supreme and infinite goal of existence which is indicated, as (an infinitesimal part of) the sea is by the finger, in the dative Nārāyanāya in Tirumantra, in the dative Nārāyanāya and in the word namas in Dvaya and in the sentence "I shall release thee from all sins" in Carama śloka ,

Thus by observing these signs in himself, the man may realise that he is well established in the state of a true prapanna in regard to his essential Nature (svarūpa), his upāya and his supreme aim (puruṣārtha) as stated in the śloka I am a self, not a body; I am the śeṣa who exists only for Lord; I have no possessions of my own; I have sought His protection with the desire to render service to Him" and as understood also from Tirumantra and the like. To the prapanna who has seen in himself these signs, there will be no causes of fear confronting him other than offence to those who know Brahman, which might occur (as a possibility) on account of his living in the midst of enemies (the body and the senses), nor sources of delight other than the service which suits his essential nature. This may be seen in the case of Sītā devi of whom it is said, "Sītā does not look at these Rākṣasis; she does not look at these trees full of flowers and fruits. Her heart is fixed on one alone and she sees only ŚrīRāma". If by chance, these (other causes of fear and sources of delight) come before him, he will have neither fear nor delight.

Those who have become well-established in their knowledge of the three things shown in the Tirumantra (namely, svarūpa, upāya, and puruṣārtha) will never agree to do what is improper and will do only what is proper. They are really wise men who find, in themselves, these attitudes and actions and they may be called eternal sūris living on the earth.

In the interval between this life of worldly enjoyment and life after mokṣa  - ( an interval) which may be compared to a mingling of the state of sleep and the waking state ---some destiny has placed prapannas for a time and they pass the rest of their lives wearing, on their heads, the garland of their nishtă in regard to tattva, upāya, and puruṣārtha, which has been vouchsafed to them by the Lord.
