GS answers previously unanswered criticisms on Ramanuja by referring solely to pre Ramanujan texts.

E.g. the popular meme is that Ramanuja misunderstood/ misrepresented Advaita. Since R never refers to an advaitic opinion by criticising an author, it is easy to claim so.

GS quotes in detail every instance of Ramanuja's representation of Advaita by researching pre Ramanuja text alone.
