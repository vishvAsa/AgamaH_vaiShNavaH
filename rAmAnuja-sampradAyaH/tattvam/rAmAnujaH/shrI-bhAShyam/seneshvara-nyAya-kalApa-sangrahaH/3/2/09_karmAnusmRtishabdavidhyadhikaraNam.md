3.2.3 कर्मानुस्मृतिशब्दविध्यधिकरणम् It is contended : it is only a different soul that emerges from the state of deep sleep because the one who has attained Brahman in the deep sleep state becomes rid of all Karma-s. This contention is wrong. It is because the soul has to experience the fruits of Karma done by it before it attains knowledge. Further, there is the experience of the identity of personality before and after such sleep. Again, there is the श्रुति text 'whatsoever these creatures are here, whether a tiger or a lion or a wolf or a bear that they become again' छान्द् Up., VI.ix.3). From these it is known that the self same soul returns after deep sleep.
