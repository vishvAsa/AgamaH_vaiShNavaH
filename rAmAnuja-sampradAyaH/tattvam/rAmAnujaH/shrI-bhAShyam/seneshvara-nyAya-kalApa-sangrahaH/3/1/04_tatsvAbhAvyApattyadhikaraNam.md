3.1.4 तत्स्वाभाव्यापत्त्यधिकरणम् The श्रुति text speaks of the descent of the soul from the moon - world, through ether, air, smoke, cloud and rain. Prior to this text the individual soul is spoken as having a body in the moon - world. In the same way, it is contended that while descending from that world; the soul must be understood as having ether, etc., as his body. This view is, however wrong. The soul had a body in the moon - world to enjoy the fruit of his actions and that he has no such experience while getting through ether, etc., The statement that 'he becomes ether' is only to show that the soul is so subtle, that he could never be distinguished from ether.
