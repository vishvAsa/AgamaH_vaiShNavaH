3.1.5 नातिचिराधिकरणम् The doubt is raised as to whether the soul in its descent while passing through the various stages remains in these stages for long or passes on to the subsequent stages quickly. It is said that the soul passes through the various stages upto the earth quickly as the श्रुति states about the later stages as to hard to escape from. Notes : 1. 'Thence he is born as rice and corn, herbs and trees, sesame and beans. From there the escape is beset with many difficulties'. छान्द् Up., V.x.6.
