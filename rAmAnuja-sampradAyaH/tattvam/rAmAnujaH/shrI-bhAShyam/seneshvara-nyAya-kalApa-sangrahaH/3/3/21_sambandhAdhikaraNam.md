3.3.7 सम्बन्धाधिकरणम् The prima facie view is : in the बृहदारण्यक it is stated that Truth is Brahman. 'That which is Truth is the Sun' - the person in the solar - orb and the person in the right eye. The text further mentions two secret names of Brahman - aham and ahar. The obejct of meditation is one and hence these names are to be combined. This view is not correct. The obejcts of meditations are different on account of difference in their substrata. In one case Brahman is to be meditated as being present in the solar - orb and in another it is to be meditated upon as being present in the right eye. And the names - ahar and aham are respectively applied to Brahman as present in the solar - orb and to Brahman as present in eye. Notes : 1. V.v.1 - 2.
