3.3.12 साम्परायाधिकरणम् The prima facie view is : the man of realization is said to abandon the effects of the good and evil deeds after he crosses the river विरजा by proceeding in the path of Gods in some texts and at the time of leaving the body here itself in some other texts. Hence a part of the deeds is left behind at the time of death and remainder of deeds on the path to the world of Brahman. This view is wrong. It must be held that the man of realization gets rid of all the deeds at the time when the self separates from the body. This is to be admitted on the basis of the श्रुति text आएओर् him there is delay only so long as he is not freed; then he will be blessed'. Notes : 1. कौष् Up., I.4. 2. छान्द् Up., VIII.xiii.1. 3. छान्द् Up., VI.xiv.2. Even if all the deeds are abandoned, the man of realization can proceed in the path of Gods on the strength of his meditation upon Brahman. The नौशीतकी text cited must be answered thus : He shakes off his good and evil deeds (I.4) and having reached the path of Gods he comes to the river विरजा and cross it.
