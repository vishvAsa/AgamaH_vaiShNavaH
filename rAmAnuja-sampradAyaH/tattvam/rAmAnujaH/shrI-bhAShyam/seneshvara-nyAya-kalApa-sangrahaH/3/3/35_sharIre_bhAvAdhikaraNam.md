3.3.21 शरीरे भावाधिकरणम् The soul, it is argued in the पूर्वपक्ष (on the authority of the ब्रह्मसूत्र I.iv.6) should meditate upon itself as the agent, knower, enjoyer as it possesses the physical body. This argument is wrong, because one should meditate upon the Supreme Brahman as having the soul as His body - the soul having eight qualities such as freedom from evil, etc., as the latter is to be attained on the basis of the maxim that 'one attains that state which he meditate upon'.
