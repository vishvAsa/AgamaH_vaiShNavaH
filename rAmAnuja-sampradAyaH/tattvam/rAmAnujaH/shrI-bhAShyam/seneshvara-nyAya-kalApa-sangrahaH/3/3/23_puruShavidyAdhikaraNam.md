3.3.9 पुरुषविद्याधिकरणम् The prima facie view is : in the छान्दोग्य and in the तैत्तिरीय meditations on Brahman are enjoined. And the two are one and the same. This view is not correct. Although the two meditations are referred to by the same name - पुरुसविद्या yet they are different as the attribute mentioned in one meditation is not mentioned in the other. The तैत्तिरीय text does not mention the parts of sacrifice mentioned in the छान्दोग्य for the purpose of meditation. The छान्दोग्य text does not make any reference to the three libations which the तैत्तिरीय mentions. (Hence the two injunctions are different). Notes : 1. III. xvi. 1. 2. नारायनाणुवाक 51.
