किञ्चिन्नारभ्योक्तेः द्युव्याप्तः संभृतिश्च वीर्याणाम् ।  
सर्वास्विति तु न यस्मात् द्युव्याप्तिर्नाल्पदेशसंग्राह्या ।। 28 ।।

3.3.8 संभृत्यधिकरणम् The prima facie view is : In the तैत्तिरीय text and in the supplementary text of the राणायनीय-s it is said that Brahman pervades the highest ether and supptros all powers. These attributes are not mentioned with reference to any special meditation. Hence these are to be included in all meditations. This view is not correct. It is because the attribute of pervading the entire ether can not be included in the meditation on Brahman as abiding in a small place like the heart. (Hence these attributes are to be taken as meant for the glorification of the obejct of meditation). Notes : 1. Taitt. ब्राह्मण II.iv.7,10.
