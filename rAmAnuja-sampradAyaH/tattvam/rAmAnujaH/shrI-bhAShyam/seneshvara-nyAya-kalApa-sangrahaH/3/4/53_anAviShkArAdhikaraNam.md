3.4.13 अनाविष्काराधिकरणम् The prima facie view is : in the बृहदारण्यक text (cited in the previous verse) it is said that the one who is devoted to meditation upon Brahman must conduct himself like a child. Since the state of child - hood can not be enjoined here what is enjoined is that the one devoted to meditation can adopt the actions of the child such as its capricious eating and moving. This view is wrong. it is because the कठोपनिषद् passage (II.24) One who has not turned away from evil conduct . . . who is distrected . . . can not attain Brahman through meditation' states that capricious eating and moving are impediments to the pursuit of meditation. Hence it can not be the sense of the expression - बाल्येन तिष्ठासेत् The meaning of the latter, however, is that the one who meditates upon Brahman should not reveal his ancestry, pride, etc. Notes : 1. The meaning of the expression बाल्येन तिष्ठासेत् is pursuit of manana only. But taking into account the meaning that could be had in ordinary experience, namely pursuit of child - like state, the question is raised and answered in this section.
