3.4.7 सर्वान्नानुमत्यधिकरणम् The prima facie view is : the छान्दोग्य text states 'in the case of the knower of प्राण there is nothing whatever that is not food'. From this it is known that there is permission to eat all foods to one who is devoted to the meditative worship on प्राण This view is not tenable. It is because eating of all foods by the knowers of Brahman who are endowed with surpassing powers is permissable only when there is danger to life. In the same way permission is accorded to eat all foods to one who is devoted to the प्राण विद्या only when there is danger to life. Notes : 1. छान्द् Up., V.ii.1.
