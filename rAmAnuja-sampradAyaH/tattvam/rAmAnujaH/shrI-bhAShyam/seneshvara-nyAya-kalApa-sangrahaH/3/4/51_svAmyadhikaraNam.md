3.4.11 स्वाम्यधिकरणम् The prima facie view is : meditation upon the उद्गीथ which is connected with sacrifice as its subsidiary is to be pursued by the sacrificer as the latter experiences the fruit of it. This view is wrong. It is because like any other subsidiary to the sacrifice, meditation upon the उद्गीथ too, in view of its being connected with sacrifice, must be pursued by the priests.
