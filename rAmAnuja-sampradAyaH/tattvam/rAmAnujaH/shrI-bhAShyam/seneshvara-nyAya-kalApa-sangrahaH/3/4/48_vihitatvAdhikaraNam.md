3.4.8 विहितत्वाधिकरणम् Sacrifices, etc., which are subsidiary to the meditation of Brahman can not be the duties of mere आश्रम-s. It is because, in that case, sacrifices, etc., are to be viewed as related to release which is permanent and to heaven, etc., which are not permanent. so far the prima facie view. This contention is wrong. It is because sacrificial rites are to be performed as life - long obligation and also as subsidiaries to knowledge on the authority of the श्रुति texts. Notes : (i) ईशावास्योपनिषद् 2 (ii) बृह् Up., IV. iv.22.
