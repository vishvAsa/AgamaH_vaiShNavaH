4.2.10 निशाधिकरणम्  
दिवा मृतस्यैव परोपसत्तिः विगर्हितत्वान्मरणस्य रात्रौ ।  
न स्यादिदं बन्धककर्महानात् विद्याबलात् तां वदति श्रुतिश्च ।। 24 ।।

4.2.10 निशाधिकरणम् The prima facie view is : only the soul which departs from the physical body during day time can attain the Supreme Brahman, as death at night is censured in the श्रुति text 'Day - time, the bright fort - night and the northern course of the sun, these are favourable for those about to die; the contrary times are unfavourable'. This view is wrong. In the case of the one who meditates upon Brahman, the attainment of Brahman is established on the strength of the power of meditation although he may die at night. And the श्रुति text 'For him the delay is only as long as he is not freed from the body, then he will be united' confirms the view that in the case of the knower of Brahman attainment of Brahman is established irrespective of his departure from this world either during day or night.
