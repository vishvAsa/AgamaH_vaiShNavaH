4.2.8 तदोकोधिकरणम् The prima facie view is : in the कठोपनिषद् text it is stated that the meditator while relinquishing the physical body which has hundred and one veins नाडी-s) passes through the artery in the crown of the head. Others depart through different veins. It is impossible to identify the artery crown of the head at the time of departure among several other veins as they are so subtle and hence there can be no specification in regard to the departure. This view is not correct. It is because the meditator can identify that particular vein (by which he would depart) by the result of meditation he had pursued before departure and by the grace of the Supreme Lord. Notes : 1. II.vi.16.
