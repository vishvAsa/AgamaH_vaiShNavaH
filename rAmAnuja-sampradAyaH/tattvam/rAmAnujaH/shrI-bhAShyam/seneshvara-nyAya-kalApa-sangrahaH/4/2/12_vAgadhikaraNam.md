4.2.1 वागधिकरणम् The prima facie view is : in the श्रुति text - वाङ् मनसि सम्पद्यते - it is stated that when a person departs from here it is only the function of speech that merges in mind and not of the sense of speech because the latter does not have mind as its material cause. This view is not correct. It is because the function of speech also does not have mind as its material cause. When it is stated in the उपनिषद् that the sense of speech merges in mind what is meant is that the sense of speech comes to be associated with mind. Notes : 1. छान्द् Up., VI.viii.6.
