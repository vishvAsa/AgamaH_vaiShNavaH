4.4.5 अभावाधिकरणम् The question arises as to whether the released soul remains free from body or without a body, since the छान्दोग्य text states that pleasure and pain do not touch him when he is free from the body. It is known that the released soul remain without a body. Since the same text in another context states that the released soul remains as one or three fold or five fold or seven fold, it is known that the released soul is associated with a body which he has taken out of his own will. The conclusive view is that there is no fixed position that the released soul must remain in either of the two forms. He could exist in two ways : with or without the body. On the basis of the two texts cited above by his own will the released soul can remain with or without the body. Notes : 1. VIII.xii.1. 2. VII.xxvi.2.
