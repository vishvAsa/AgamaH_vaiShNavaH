4.1.10 अग्निहोत्राद्यधिकरणम् The prima facie view is : since there are texts that proclaim that the results of the deeds performed prior to the attainment of the mature state of meditation will be destroyed and of those performed after the attainment of the above state will not cling to the soul, one need not perform any ritual - act relating to one`s stage and class of life. This is not correct. On the basis of the श्रुति text : 'Men of spiritual birth seek to realize Brahman by the study of the Veda-s and by the performance of sacrifices, etc.,' and on the basis of the inherent strength of actions to make meditation perfect, one must perform one`s allotted duties.
