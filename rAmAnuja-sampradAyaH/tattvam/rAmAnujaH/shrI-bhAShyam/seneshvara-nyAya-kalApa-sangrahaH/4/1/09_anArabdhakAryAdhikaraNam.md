4.1.9 अनारब्धकार्याधिकरणम् The prima facie view is : in the case of the one who has attained the mature state of meditation, all good and evil deeds done before and after the attainment of that state will be destroyed irrespective of whether they are fructified or not. This contention is wrong. It is because the fructified deeds will remain without being annihilated. The श्रुति text too states that the delay in regard to the attainment of liberation is due to the absence of separation from the physical body. Notes : 1. छान्द् Up., VI.xiv.2.
