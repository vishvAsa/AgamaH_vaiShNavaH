2.1.7 इतरव्यपदेशाधिकरणम् The prima facie view is : 'the texts - tat tvam asi and the like convey that the soul is identical with Brahman; And the soul will not create the world full of miseries. who will desire to have misery for oneself? Hence Brahman with the soul can not be viewed as the creator of the world'. This view is not sound. It is because the text 'There are two birds in the body of which one experiences the fruits of actions while the other remains as a witness' श्वेत् Up., III.i.1), declares the difference between the soul and Brahman. The texts that declare non - difference between the two declare the fact that Brahman has the soul as Its body and It is its inner-self.
