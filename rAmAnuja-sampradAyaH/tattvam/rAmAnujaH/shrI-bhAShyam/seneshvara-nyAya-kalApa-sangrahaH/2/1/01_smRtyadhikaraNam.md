2.1.1 स्मृत्यधिकरणम् The contention that Brahman can not be considered to be the cause of the world as such a view is contradictory to the स्मृति text of sage Kapila - the text that substantiates the teaching of स्मृति is wrong in view of the fact that there would then arise contradiction with other स्मृति texts (that speak of Brahman as the cause of the world). Further the rejection of the doctrine that Brahman is the cause of the world would result in the defect of leaving no scope for some other स्मृति-s.
