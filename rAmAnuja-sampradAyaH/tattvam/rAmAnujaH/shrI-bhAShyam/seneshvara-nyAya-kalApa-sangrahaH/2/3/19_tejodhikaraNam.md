2.3.2 तेजोधिकरणम् Brahman can not be the direct cause of the effects. The effects such as पृथिवी etc., are declared to originate from their immediately preceding elements. Thus fire originated from air, fire produced water and water created the earth.1 Hence Brahman could not be maintained to be the cause of all. This view is not tenable; for, every element is declared to be created directly from Brahman, as it is Brahman itself which remains as each element, having everything as His body. Notes : 1. Taitt. Up., I.2. 2. बृह् Up., V.vii.
