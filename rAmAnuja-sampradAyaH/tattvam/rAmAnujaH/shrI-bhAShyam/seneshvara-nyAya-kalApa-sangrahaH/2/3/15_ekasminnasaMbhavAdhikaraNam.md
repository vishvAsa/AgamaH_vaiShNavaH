2.2.6 एकस्मिन्नसंभवाधिकरणम् Every obejct in the world can be said to have all features, namely, as existence, non - existence, difference and non - difference, permanence and impermanence, etc.1 This view too is unsound. Difference, non - difference, etc., which are opposed to each other can not exist in one and the same substratum. 2 Notes : 1. Every obejct undergoes transformation and this is technically known as पर्याय Because of this transformative nature every obejct can be said to be different, non - different, etc. 2. Cf: BS. II.ii.33.
