2.2.4 उपलब्ध्यधिकरणम् The prima facie view is : An obejct is nothing but the variation of knowledge and there is no dispute in regard to this. This view is unsound. It is because there is always the manifestation of knowledge as having a locus and a content. Notes : The विज्ञानवाद school of Buddhism is of the view that it is only knowledge or mental state which is momentary that appears as obejct. In fact there is nothing apart from knowledge. This view is rejected on the ground that the notion of knowledge would be complete only when there is the manifestation of knowledge, its substratum and its content.
