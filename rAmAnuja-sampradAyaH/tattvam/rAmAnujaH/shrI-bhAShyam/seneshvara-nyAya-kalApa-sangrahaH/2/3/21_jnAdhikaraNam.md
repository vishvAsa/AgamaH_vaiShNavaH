2.3.4 ज्ञाधिकरणम् The साङ्ख्य-s contend that the individual soul can not be said to be the substratum of knowledge because he is declared to be of the nature of knowledge, and, also knowledge is absent during the state of deep sleep. The न्याय - वैशेशिक on the other hand, holds that the self is essentially insentient and sentience is an extraneous feature of it. Neither of the two views finds scriptural sanction for the श्रुति declares him to be both of the form of knowledge and also as possessor of knowledge.1 He is designated as ज्ञान as knowledge forms his essence; and absence of knowledge during deep-sleep is because of its remaining un - manifest and not because it is totally effaced. Notes : 1. BS. II. iii. 29.
