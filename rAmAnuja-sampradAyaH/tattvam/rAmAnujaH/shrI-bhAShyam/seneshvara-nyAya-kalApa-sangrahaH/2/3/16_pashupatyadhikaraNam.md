2.2.7 पशुपत्यधिकरणम् The system of पाशुपत could be considered as a valid one as it has been approved by the sages and, Lord शिव is spoken of as omniscient. This system too is not acceptable, because it is in contradiction with the vedic statements and शिव is spoken as परावर that is, as lower in status to the Supreme Reality, namely, Brahman. (Moreover (He Lord शिव is subject to कर्म only). Notes : 1. BS. II.ii.38.
