2.3.6 परायत्ताधिकरणम् The prima - facie view is : the agency of the individual soul, is independent of the Lord as then alone the scriptural injunctions would become meaningful. It is only for those who are independent scriptural injunctions could be addressed. This view is not correct. The scriptures clearly declare that the agency of the individual soul is dependent upon the Supreme Lord. The Lord being his inner controller1 is merely a witness for the good or the bad result to the individual soul. There can be no violation of scriptures then, in this regard and this is reasonable. Notes : 1. बृह् Up., V.vii.22.
