2.2.2 महद्दीर्घाधिकरणम् The न्याय school admits that God is the efficient cause of the world; and the souls are many. Yet this school is not sound. It is because there can not arise any effect from atoms which are partless and which do not have any material shape. Further the effect is admitted to be distinct from the cause. Notes : In ordinary experience, we find that the characteristics of a cause pervades the effect. And this would be possible only when there is identity between a cause and an effect. Further, the so - called cause according to the न्याय school is atom which is partless. In ordinary experience however, we notice that a cause is composed of parts.
