2.2.5 सर्वथानुपपत्त्यधिकरणम्  
नित्योत्पत्तिप्रसङ्गात् अविकृतभवनं नाम नैवोपपन्नं नैवावस्थानहानेः   
विकृतभवनमप्यश्नुते युक्तिमत्ताम् ।  
तस्मात्तुच्छात् प्रभूतं भुवनम् इति न सद्वस्तुनः कस्यचित्स्यात्  
भावाभावव्यवस्था तदितरविषये तेन तुच्छत्वहानिः ।। 19 ।।

2.2.5 सर्वथानुपपत्त्यधिकरणम् The prime facie view is : the origination of an effect from a cause without the latter undergoing any change is not reasonable in view of the unwelcome position of the origination of an effect always. The view that an effect arises from absence as not reasonable in view of the fact that the effect must be viewed as absence only. Hence the world has come into existence from void. This view is wrong : It is because existence and non - existence are only the modes of an existent entity. Hence the view that void is the source of the world is not correct. Notes : An object which is comprehended as being existent has the feature of existence; and, an obejct which is comprehended as being non - existent has the feature of non - existence. Existence and non - existence are only the modes of an existent entity.
