1.2.1 सर्वत्रप्रसिद्ध्यधिकरणम् Having raised the doubt that it is only जीव or the soul that is the efficient cause of the world through its past merits and demirts, and the word आत्मन् in the उपनिषदिc texts refer to जीव only as they convey it to be of minute size and as having small abode, the author of the सूत्र-s rejects it on the grounds that the qualities well - known to denote Brahman are set forth with reference to the cause of the world and that the qualities mentioned are applicable only to Brahman and that the स्मृति text declares Brahman to be the cause of the world.
