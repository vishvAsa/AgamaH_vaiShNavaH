1.1.4 समन्वयाधिकरणम् Having raised the doubt as to the validity of the उपनिषद्-s in respect of Brahman - the existent entity on the ground that the knowledge of Brahman admitted to arise from them, does not prompt one towards activity or restrain one from committing an interdicted action, the author of the सूत्र-s has rejected the doubt by establishing that Brahman which is the self of all - beings is the one that an aspirant seeks after1. Notes : 1. The पूर्वमीमांसा school argues that sentences such as "He who desires heaven shall perform ज्योतिष्टोम sacrifice","ज्योतिष्टोमेन स्वर्गकामो यजेत"and "A man of spiritual birth should not be killed", ' ब्राह्मणो न हन्तव्यः ' acquire validity by giving rise to the cognition that prompts one to activity or restrains one from certain act. The knowledge of Brahman arising from the उपनिषदिc texts neither prompts one towards activity nor restrains him from some act. Hence the उपनिषदिc texts are not valid. This contention is answered by saying that Brahman is known from the उपनिषद्-s as of the nature of Bliss. He who experiences such a bliss has attained the highest human end. Thus the उपनिषदिc texts by conveying something which is of Supreme value to the soul are valid in respect of Brahman. 1.1.4 समन्वयाधिकरणम् On these four aphorisms, the author of the सूत्र-s has rejected on the basis of reasoning the prima facie suppositions. 1. the words of the उपनिषद्-s cannot signify Brahman - the existent entity; 2. Brahman can not be defined; 3. It is revealed by other means of knowledge; and, 4. the inquiry is of no value1. Notes : 1. See तत्त्वटीका काञ्ची edn., p.9
