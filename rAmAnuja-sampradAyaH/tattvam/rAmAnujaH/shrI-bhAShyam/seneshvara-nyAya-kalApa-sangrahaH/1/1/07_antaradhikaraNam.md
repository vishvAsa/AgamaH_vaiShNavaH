1.1.7 अन्तरधिकरणम् Since the person who is said to exist in the midst of the solar - orb is said to have a body, there arises the doubt that person must be only an individual soul with supra - normal powers. The author of the Brahma - सूत्र-s has dispelled this doubt by pointing out that that person is Supreme Brahman only in view of references to him as possessing the qualities of the Supreme Being like lordship over the world, etc1. Notes : 1. The import of the छान्दोग्य (I.vi.6) text "now that radiano person who is seen within the solar - orb" - अथ य एषोऽन्तरादित्ये हिरण्मयः पुरुषो दृश्यते । etc., is discussed here. The person that is referred to as being present in the solar - orb is the Supreme Being because the उपनिषद् (छान्द् Up., VIII.i.5) एष आत्माऽपहतपाप्मा विजरः विमृत्युर्विशोको विजिघत्सोऽपिपासः सत्यकामःt सत्यसंकल्पः । later attributes qualities like being the creator of the Universe, etc., the qualities that apply only to the Supreme Being with reference to that person.
