1.1.2 जन्माद्यधिकरणम् The characteristics, namely, the origin, etc., of the world can not define Brahman, as there arises the unwelcome position of these signifying more than one Brahman. They can not be accidental features of Brahman too, as Brahman is not known from any other source. This section rejects this objection by stating that the characteristics can define Brahman and also indicate it1. Notes : 1. The import of the तैत्तिरीय text [III.1] "यतो वा इमानि भूतानि जायन्ते, येन जातानि जीवन्ति, यत् प्रयन्त्यभिसंविशन्ति - तद्विजिज्ञासस्व, तद्ब्रह्म । That from which these things originate, by which they are sustained after their origination and into which they lapse back at the time of dissolution - seek to know that'; That is Brahman is discussed in this अधिकरण The characteristics such as the origin of the world, etc., are not contradictory to each other as they have reference to different times of origination, sustenance and dissolution. And also they could convey one and the same Brahman. This is analogous to the defining of the person Devadatta with the characteristics of being tall, fair - looking, etc., wherein the characteristics are not contradictory to each other. It comes to this : the characteristics of being the origin of the world, etc., can define Brahman. Further one can have the idea of Brahman from the etymological derivation of the work - Brahman as one having बृहत्वात् बृंहणत्वात् supra - normal greatness and power of growth. Thus we have an idea of Brahman prior to the functioning of the तैत्तिरीय text cited above. so the characteristics such as the origin, etc., of the world can indicate Brahman by serving as its accidental features. Therefore knowledge of Brahman through these characteristics is possible.
