1.1.5 ईक्षत्यधिकरणम् It is said: thinking on the part of sat is only figurative as it is conveyed in the sentence that occurs in the context1 - where thinking is used in a figurative sense. Since it is so, प्रधान is the cause of the world. The author of the सूत्र-s rejects this view on the ground that the word 'thinking' is used in the primary sense, as sat with reference to which thinking is attributed is referred to as the self (of श्वेतकेतु)2. Notes : 1. The छान्दोग्य text 'That fire thought' तत्तेज ऐक्षत (VI.ii.3) is referred to here. 2. The prima facie view that the cause of the world that is referred to in the तैत्तिरीय text (III.1) is not Brahman, but is only प्रकृति which is inert is rejected here. The cause of the world is referred to by the term sat in the छान्दोग्य text 'Sat alone was there at the beginning' सदेव सोम्येदमग्र आसीत् (VI.ii.1). The same text then states later 'It (sat) contemplated' तदैक्षत । And the activity of contemplation is not possible in the case of an inert entity like प्रधान It might be thought that "thinking" is used in a secondary sense with regard to sat and so sat may be viewed as प्रकृति - the inert principle. It can not be so because sat is referred to later in the छान्दोग्य text (VI.viii.7) ऐतदात्म्यमिदं सर्वम् । तत् सत्यम् । स आत्मा । तत्त्वमसि श्वेतकेतो । as the self of श्वेतकेतु and an inert principle can not be the self of श्वेतकेतु - an intelligent being.
