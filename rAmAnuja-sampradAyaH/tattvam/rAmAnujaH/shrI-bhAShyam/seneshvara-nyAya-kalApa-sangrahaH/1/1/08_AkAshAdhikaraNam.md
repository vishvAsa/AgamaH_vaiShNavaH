1.1.8 आकाशाधिकरणम् AND प्राणाधिकरणम् The doubt that आकाश or प्राण in view of their being specifically mentioned may be thought of as the cause of the world is removed by the author of the सूत्र by pointing out that आकाश and प्राण referred to signifying the Supreme Being in view of the fact that they are stated to be the final goal to be attained by all souls. Notes : 1. The import of the छान्दोग्य text (I.ix.i) "all beings take their rise from आकाश only and dissolve in it" - सर्वाणि ह वा इमानि भूतान्याकाशादेव समुत्पद्यन्ते; आकाशं प्रत्यस्तं यन्ति; and that of another text of the same उपनिषद् (I.ii.4) "all these beings merge in प्राण alone and from प्राण they rise" are discussed here. The words आकाश and प्राण denote the Supreme Being and not the elemental ether and the vital air. It is because the छान्दोग्य texts आकाश is their ultimate resort" (I.ix.2) and "all beings merge in प्राण (I.ii.5) mention that आकाश and प्राण are the ultimate resort of all beings including sentient souls. Neither the elemental ether nor the vital air can be the final goal to be attained by the souls.
