1.4.3 संख्योपसंग्रहाधिकरणम् The contention that in the बृहदारण्यक text (IV.iv.7) 'that in which the पञ्च पञ्चजनाः - five of the quintuplet and space are placed, that very self I regard as the immortal Brahman', there is a clear mention of number of things (that can be enumerated as twenty - five) which corresponds to the साङ्ख्य categories, does not hold good. It is because the five of the quintuplet is stated to remain in Brahman1. Further the साङ्ख्य categories being diverse do not have five common qualities to form five groups (Hence the expression पञ्च पञ्चजनाः does not refer to the साङ्ख्य categories). Just as the seven ऋषि-s constitute the group called sapta सप्तर्षि-s2, in the same way the quintuplet constitutes the group called पञ्च पञ्चजनाः् Notes : 1. The साङ्ख्य however, admits that the categories are independent of the पुरुष 2. This does not mean seven times seven that is fortynine ऋषि-s, but simply seven ऋषि-s constituting the group called सप्तर्षि-s. 3. जननाच्च जनाः, वेदान्तदीप I.iv.12. The five are : vital force, eye, ear, food and mind.
