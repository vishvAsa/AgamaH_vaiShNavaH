1.3.2 भूमाधिकरणम् सनत्कुमार while instructing नारद about the nature of the soul begins with Name that goes highest and higher and ends with soul or प्राण1. It is, therefore, argued that the word भूमन् too used in a subsequent section2 refers to the soul only. It is said that it is not so. It is because the soul or प्राण is said to be an अतिवादिन् or one who makes a statement surpassing previous statements3. In a subsequent section4 it is said 'But he really is an अतिवादिन् who has realized the Truth'. स वा एष एवं पश्यन् एवं मन्वान एवं विजानन् अतिवादी भवति । And the latter is distinguished from the earlier one which is the soul. The nature of the Truth is described as भूमान् or infinite bliss5. Notes : 1. छान्द् Up., VII, i.3. 2. छान्द् Up., VII.xxii.22. 2. According to the पूर्वपक्षिन् there is no break from the topic dealing with the soul. 3. छान्द् Up., VII.xv, 15. 4. Vide : VII.xvi, 1. 5. Vide : VII.xxiii, 1. There is thus a break from the topic dealing with the soul.
