1.3.6 प्रमिताधिकरणम् It is argued that the one who is referred to in the उपनिषद्1 as of the size of a thumb is the soul only as the latter is well - known to be so in the text - 'The ruler of the body, the sense - organs2, etc. This view is wrong. It is because the same text which speaks of the person of the size of a thumb is declared, as the Lord of past and future. This rulership is not possible in the case of the soul.
