1.3.8 मध्वधिकरणम् The contention that Gods such as Vasu and others are not entitled to pursue meditative worships designated as Madhu, etc.1, in view of the fact that they themselves are the objects of such meditations and the fruits of such meditations they already have is wrong because they could meditate on Supreme Brahman with a view to retain their present positions in the next cycle. Notes : 1. In Madhu - vidya one has to meditate on Sun - God. And it is not possible for the Sun - God to pursue such a meditation. Further the result of such meditation is the attainment of the position of Sun - God which the latter is occupying already. Hence Gods are not entitled for certain meditations. This is the prima facie view. The सिद्धान्त view is that the obejct of meditation by Sun - God is Supreme Brahman and the fruit of such meditation is not the attainment of the state of Sun - God but the continuance of the latter in the next cycle too.
