### १ PREFACE
THE Vedantasara is an easy and concise commentary on the Brahmasutras of Badarāyaṇa who is believed to be identical with Vyasa, the famous author of the Mahābhārata. The Vedantasara was written by Bhagavad Ramanuja (1017 to 1137 A.D.) in accordance with the views of the Vis'iṣṭadvaita school of Vedanta. Sri Ramanuja was born at Sriperumbudur near Kāñici- puram as the son of Kes'avasomayājin and Bhudevi. He was the pupil of Mahāpūrṇa and younger con- temporary of Sri Yamunācārya of Srirangam. His other works are: S'ribhāṣya, Bhagavadgitābhāṣya, Vedarthasaṁgraha, Vedāntadipa, Gadyatraya and Nityagrantha. Regarding the complete biography of Sri Ramanuja, the attention of the readers is drawn to the Rāmānujacampu of Rāmānujācārya, published in the Madras Govt. Oriental MS. Series No. 6. His doctrine and teaching have been fully dealt with by Prof. P. N. Srinivasacarya in his book entitled The Philosophy of Vis'iṣṭadvaita' published in the Adyar Library Series No. 39. This system was first expound- ed by Sri Nathamuni, was developed to a great extent by Srl Yamunācārya through his works and was well preserved by Sri Ramanuja through his works like the 
vi 
Sribhāṣya, and Vedarthasaṁgraha, after refuting the contrary views of the opponents. 
Perhaps this edition of the Vedantasara with English translation is unique in its kind and I believe it will render great and valuable service to the research scholars in their comparative and critical study of the Vedanta philosophy.

V. KRISHNAMACHARYAINTRODUCTION 
AFTER completing the course of study of the Vedas, the student should perform the rituals mentioned therein. There are rules prescribed for the proper performance of them. But in the Vedas proper, these rules are not mentioned at all. Therefore the student has to go to other works for them. Consequently certain subsidiary works on the rules of inter- pretation were composed by the sages and the earliest of these works was the Mimämsäsutras of Jaimini. 
But these Sutras were very short statements and they could be interpreted in different ways; consequently a number of commentators arose. They interpreted these Sūtras differently. The performance of the rituals mentioned therein. grant only limited and transitory results. Hence these vedic scholars went in search of other systems that could give the unlimited and everlasting results. 
Bādarayana is the author of the Brahmasutras. He has stated therein, on the authority of the Upanisads, that the knowledge of the Brahman leads to everlasting benefits. Badarāyaṇa mentions the names of Asmarathya, Auḍulomi, Badari and Kasakṛtsna to show that they also were the writers on the subject before him. 
Certain occidental writers have placed the Sutra period in the second century B. C. Their one object seems to have been to show to the world that the Indians copied everything 
ix 
from the Greek literature. But the Indian writers have not mentioned the date of their composition in any of their works. Hence it is not possible to determine exactly when these. Sūtras were composed. But the general impression is that Bādarāyaṇa, who is no other than Vyasa, lived about 3101 B. C. i.e. the beginning of the Kali age. 
These Sutras, as already stated, are short and cryptic statements. They can be interpreted in any way as the commentators liked. Hence they had a number of cominen. tators, namely, S'ri S'amkara, Rāmānuja, Pūrṇaprjña, Bhās- kara, Nimbarka, Vallabha and others. Each of these commentators interpreted the Sutras in his own way different from the others. At times, a Sutra was split into two by certain commentators or some of the Sutras are missing in certain commentaries. 
Sri Ramanuja has contributed nine works in Sanskrit on the Visiṣṭādvaita philosophy. None of his Tamil works is available so far. The Sanskrit works are (1) Vedāntasära, (2) Vedāntadipa, (3) S'ri-Bhāṣya (4) Gītābhāṣya, (5) Vedär- thasamgraha, (6) S'araṇāgatigadya, (7) Vaikunthagadya, (8) S'ri-rangagadya and (9) Nityagrantha. Of these, the S'ri- Bhāṣya is an elaborate commentary on the Brahmasutras of Bādarāyaṇa. Vedāntasära is a very concise commentary on the same and Vedantadipa is a commentary in between these two. 
In the introduction to his Vedāntadīþa S'rī Rāmānuja summarises the teachings of Vedanta to the following effect: Of the three ultimate entities known to philosophy, the intelligent individual soul is essentially different from the non- intelligent matter and the Supreme Brahman. The essential differences thus existing between matter, soul and the Brahman, are intrinsic and natural. God, who is the same 
as the Supreme Brahman, is the material and efficient cause of the universe; and the universe, which is made up of matter and soul, is the effect produced by Him. Matter and soul form the body of God, and this body is capable of existing in a subtle, as well as in a gross condition. God with his subtle body constitutes the universe in His casual condition; and with His gross body, He forms the created universe itself. The individual souls enter into matter and thereby make it live. Similarly God enters into matter and soul and give them their powers and their specific characters. The universe without God is exactly analogous to matter without soul and in the world, as we know it, all things are what they are, because God has penetrated into them and rules and guides them all from within, so much so that all things are representatives of Him and all words denote Him in the 
main. 
Sri Ramanuja has based his commentaries on the following works: (1) Divyaprabandha of Sri S'aṭhakota; (2) Siddhitraya (3) Aganıaprāmāṇya and (4) Stotraratna of Sri Yamuna; and (5) Nyayatativa and (6) Yogarahasya of Sri Nathamuni. Of these the Divyaprabandha is written in Tamil and the rest are all written in Sanskrit. Further 
S'ri Nathmuni's works are not available now. 
Certain special features can be noted in S'ri Rāmānuja's works. Of all the Sanskrit commentators of the Brahmasutra, Ramanuja is unique in one respect and that is this namely he proved the relation between the Brahman on one side and the souls and matter on the other, in the form of soul and body (S'arira-sariribhāvu) so that all the scriptural texts on the Bheda and Abheda between them, could be sensibly interpreted. In support of this view he mentions Bodhāyana, Dramiḍa, Guha, and Ţanka and others, who had lived before 
xi 
him and who had written treatises on the Brahmasutras. He also states in S'ri-Bhasya that he has followed their teachings in this work. 
Sri Ramanuja has held that the twelve chapters of Purva- mimāṁsa, four chapters of Samkarsakāṇḍa and the four chapters of the Brahmasutras constitute one system of philosophy. In support of this view, he has quoted the passage from Bodhāyana thus : " संहितमेतच्छारीरकं जैमिनीयेन षोडशलक्षणेनेति mecheafafa: "'. 
The authors of these three works are different persons, but these constitute one main work, as they deal with one subject. Jaimini begins his work with Atha (then). The Brahmasūtras also begin with Atha. By this, it is not correct to hold that they are different works. Even in Jaimini's Mimämsäsütras different chapters begin with the word Atha. 
According to S'rī Rāmānuja, Bhaktiyoga is the means for the realisation of the Self and the attainment of Mokşa which constitutes eternal Bliss. It is synonymous with Upasana (meditation). That Bhakti (devotion) results wholly from Viveka (discrimination), Vimoka (freedom), Abhyāsa (practice), Kriya (work), Kalyāṇa (auspiciousness), Anava- sada (absence of weakness), and Anuddharṣa (absence of excessive merriment); because it is only so possible, and because also there is scriptural authority to that effect. 
Who then is this Brohman? S'rī Rāmānuja defines Him thus: By the word Brahman is denoted the Highest Person who is, by nature, devoid of all evils and is possessed of a host of auspicious qualities, which are innumerable and unsurpass able in excellence. For, everywhere in the contexts the word Brahman is seen to have been derived from the association of Brhattva (greatness) and whatever greatness is, by nature. as well as by qualities, unsurpassable in excellence, that is its 
xii 
primary and natural meaning. And He who possesses such greatness, is alone the Lord of all. Hence the word Brahman is primarily used to signify Him alone. In cases where, on account of the association of a modicum of that quality, other things than the Lord are meant by the word Brahman, it must have been used in a secondary sense; because it is improper to postulate a variety of meanings for it, as it is improper in the case also of the word, Bhagavat. He is the Supreme Self known as Nārāyaṇa whose abode is Sri Vaikuntha and whose consort is S'ri or Maha-Lakṣmi. 
The Brahmasutras consist of four Adhyayas (chapters) and each of the four chapters consists of four Pādas (parts). The first chapter is called the Samantayādhyāya and it determines that the Brahman is the cause of creation, sustenance and destruction of the universe. The second chapter is called the Avirodhadhyaya and it removes any inconsistency that may arise for such determination. It estab- lishes firmly what the first chapter has done. The third chapter is called Sadhanadhyāya and it mentions the means for attaining the Brahman. The last chapter is called Phaladh. yaya and it treats of the results obtained from that means. In the scheme of things, the first two chapters are quite distinct from the last two chapters. 
The Vedintasütra begins with this benedictory verse: 
'I bow unto Visnu who has for his body all the sentient and the nonsentient beings, who is the Self of all objects, who is associated with the Goddess S'ri; who is the Ocean of Bliss untainted with impurity'. 
By this we learn that the Supreme Being according to Sri Rāmānuja is Visņu who has for his body all the sentient and the non-sentient beings. It is also clear that the sentient. beings, the non-sentient things and the Lord are distinct fromxviii 
The next four Sutras state thus: On the passing of the works, the individual self returns to the world with a remainder of the works, whose fruit he has not enjoyed. 
The next ten Sutras state thus: Those who have done meritorious works, (Punya karmans), reach the moon. But those who have done non-meritorious works (Papa-karmans) do not go to the moon. 
The next Sutra states thus: The individual self on his return journey from the moon passes through the ether, the wind, the smoke and the cloud in an order. Then he comes 
into the earth in the form of rain. 
The first six Sutras of the second part of the third chapter state thus: The objects seen in the dreams are real and not created by the individual selves: but they are the creations of the Highest Self. 
The next two Sutras state thus: 'In the deep state of sleep, it is stated that the individual selves sleep in the Nāḍīs and also in pericardium. When they awake they do not know that they have slept on the Brahman.' The next Sūtra states thus: 'The same person, (who was in a deep state of sleep) rises from sleep; because there are the works for which the person of defective knowledge has to undergo retribution; because also there is the remembrance. 
The next fifteen Sūtras state thus: 'No mistake arises in he Highest Brahman, even if He remains as an immanent Self in all the four states, such as the waking state etc. In the scriptures and in the Smṛtis it is stated that Highest Brahman possesses twofold characteristics, namely, the absence of inauspicious qualities and the presence of all auspicious ones. Sins do cling to the individual selves. The individual selves and the Highest Self are encased in a body; yet their differential characteristics are stated in the scriptures. 
xix 
The third and fourth parts of the third chapter deal with various Brahmavidyas which lead men to Mokşa and other aspirations according to their wishes. 
IV Adhyāya. The first two Sutras of the first part of the fourth chapter states thus: 'The knowing that is useful for the attainment of the final release, has to be repeated more than once.' Bhagavān S'rī Kṛṣṇa states thus: Worship Me, with a devotion, directed to nothing else. Whose minds are fixed on Me I lift them before long etc.' (Bhag. Gi. 12-7). The next Sutra states thus: The meditation should be on the Highest Self who is the Self of the individual selves. The next Sutra state thus: The Highest Self should not be apprehended in the symbol of the mind etc. 
" 
He then states thus: Meditation has to be made every- day till death; because the scriptures say so. The next Sutra states thus: When the meditation on the Brahman is begun the earlier sins do not cling to him; because those meditations. have that power. The next Sutra states thus: 'As regards the wise, the ordinary good deeds obstruct the attainment of final release. But as they grant undesierd fruits, they either do nothing to the selves or become destroyed. After death they do not yield any results. The next Sutra states thus: 'The good and evil deeds performed before the acquisition of knowledge, become destroyed without granting any fruits. The texts say that they last till death. 
The next three Sutras state: Agnihotra etc. are the works to be performed by the Asramin. The life of an Asramin is only intended for the acquisition of knowledge. The good and bad deeds do not cling to a person, who has obtained the knowledge on the Brahman. Further the works done with knowledge cause obstruction to the grant of the fruits after death. The last Sutra states thus: 'Having 
XX 
destroyed by enjoyment the two kinds of deeds, the self reaches the Brahman'. 
The first two Sutras of the second part state thus: 'The organ of speech and other sense-organs stop working at the time of death. Hence it is right to say that the sense-organs combine with the mind at death. 
The next Sutra states: At death the mind is combined with the breath (Prāṇa) and the Prana with the self. 
Then it is stated thus: The wise and the unwise follow the same path till they reach the path of light, etc. The Brahman could be reached only by traversing the path of light. A subtle body persists even after death. 
Then the Sutras state thus: The Highest Person remains within the heart of the individual selves. Through His grace the door of the heart becomes illuminated. Then he leaves the body through the Susumna Nadi on his head'. 
4 
The next Sutra states thus: The wise go upwards through the rays. These rays remain at night also. In the winter season they are covered with snow. The next Sutra states thus: 'Even those, who die at night, reach the Brahman. The man must perform his duty, as long as he is encased in the body. The works, which have begun to produce the results, die with the body. They do not stand in the way of attainment of the Brahman. 
The next two Sutras state thus: The wise reach the Brahman even if they die during the southern progress of the sun. The Yogins remember both the paths and they will not be deluded by doubt. 
C 
The third part begins: The wise traverse by the path of right etc'. 
The next two Sutras state thus: The presiding deities of light etc. who are directed by the Highest Person are 
xxi 
conductors of the wise. After lightning, the self reaches the Brahman. The next ten Sutras state thus: Bādari thinks that those who meditate on the effected Brahman (i.e. Hiranyagarbha) traverse the path of light etc. Because the self that reaches Hiranyagarbha does not come back to the world; because when the world of Hiranyagarbha passes away, then the selves go with their ruler to the Highest. Jaimini thinks that the Highest alone should be meditated upon always. Bādarayana states that those who meditate upon the Brahman traverse the path of light etc. Some meditate upon the Brahman as the Self of their selves. While others meditate on their selves as having the Brahman for the Self. 
The first three Sutras of the fourth part state thus: 'The self reveals itself in all his glory when he reaches the Highest.' The next Sūtra states thus: The released self experi- ences the Highest, who is his Self, as one with him.' 
The next three Sutras state thus: Jaimini thinks that the nature like that of the Brahman, such as free from sin, mani- fests itself in the individual Self. Audulomi thinks that his very nature is intelligence. But Badarāyaṇa opines that he possesses both of them mentioned above. 
The next two Sutras state thus: 'The Highest Person, while in a sportive mood, is born as the son of Vasudeva and Dasaratha by His mere wills. In the same manner the released soul, who is included in the sportive activity of the Highest Brahman, can have father, etc. in the world through his will. But the released Self is not subject to Karman at anytime. 
The next seven Sutras state thus: Bādari holds that released Self does not possess a body and the sense-organs. Jaimini opines that he becomes manifold with the help of the body and sense-organs. But Bādarāyaṇa thinks that he possesses both these characteristics. The released Self does 
xxii 
not possess bodies, that are his own creation. He enjoys the sport, created by the Highest Person. The Self enjoys every- thing by entering all as in the case of the lamp. The Self remains in one place. But he experiences everything through knowledge that acts as his light. 
The next five Sutras state thus: The released self possesses the character of the Highest Person except creation, sustenance, and destruction of the world. 
The last Sutra states thus: The released self does not come back again to the world. 
Sri Ramanuja postulates Personal God. He defines the Brahman thus: By the word, Brahman, is denoted the Highest Person, who is, by nature, devoid of all evil, and is possessed of hosts of auspicious qualities, which are innumer- able and unsurpassable in excellence. He accepts a world that is real, as is opposed to the world of illusion of the Advaitins. Of the means of attainment be accepts the Bhakti and Prapatti wherein the Lord is considered both as a means and the object of attainment. Only he attains the Lord whom He elects with grace. This is the truth of this system. 
In concluding I wish to offer my heart felt thanks to Rao Bahadur K. V. Rangaswami Ayyangar, at whose instance I translated into English the text of the Vedantasära and to Vaidyaratna G. Srinivasa Murti Director Adyar Library for undertaking to publish this work in the Adyar Library Series. My special thanks are also due to Pandit V. Krishnamacharya of the Adyar Library for revising the translation and editing it with the text. He also has added some necessary notes and a valuable introduction in Sanskrit. I request the general public to pardon me for any short comings that they may find in the work.

Then therefore the inquiry into the Brahman. 
Here the word, then is used in the sense of coming there- after; because it is followed by the word therefore. The word, therefore, is used in the sense of causation of that which has been concluded previously. What has been concluded pre- viously, is understood to be the knowledge of ritualistic works; because the inquiry into the Brahman, which is desired to be commenced here, happens to be a portion of the inquiry into the meaning of the Vedas. Indeed, for the person, who has completed his study of the Vedas, the first duty is to make an inquiry into the ritualistic works, as the Vedas commence to deal with them in the beginning. Hence it is stated "Then therefore the inquiry into the Dharma " ( Mim. 1. 1. 1). Taking the topic of Dharma separately, it is determined in the series of Sutras ending with "The priestly function must be common for all the castes as all are able to do it” (Mim. 12-4-40) that

To him (i.e. to such a pupil) who with tranquil mind and restrained senses has thus approached, that wise person (the guru) should speak of the knowledge about the Brahman by which he (the pupil) can know the ever-existing and indestructible Puruşa (person)' (Mund. 1-2-12 & 13). Here the Brahmana is one, who is en- gaged in the study of the Vedas. The word Karmacitān means ' gained through the works'. The word worlds (lokān) means to imply those worlds that are destructible by nature as the

deities worshipped are destructible'. He should determine. thus on inquiry into Karman-'The Highest Person who is eternal can not be attainable by works'. He (i.e. the pupil) then acquires distaste in all worldly objects. To know That (Brahman) he should approach the preceptor alone with fuel in hand. The word, ' srotriya' means, one who is learned in the Vedas up to the end'. The words 'who has a steady footing in the Brahman' mean 'One who has appre- hended the true nature of the Highest Person'. Then he (the preceptor) should speak of the knowledge of the Brahman to him (the pupil) who approached him properly, with which knowledge the pupil can know the Eternal Highest Person. The perfect tense in the word Provaca should be taken to mean the injunction, because of the construction The pupil should approach the preceptor alone and the learned preceptor should teach him'. More over, the teaching by the preceptor is not known ordained otherwise. The perfect tense is ordained in the sense of injunction by the rule—— In Veda, the aorist, imperfect and perfect tenses are used in other senses also ' ( Pān. 3-4-6 ).

(The Brahman is He) from whom (proceed) the creation, etc. of this Universe. 
The scriptural text is this- From whom all these beings are born; by whom, when born, they are all preserved and to whom they go back when they perish-do you desire to know that well, that is the Brahman' (Tait. III-1-1). The meaning of the Sūtra is thus - The Vedic text declares that it is the Brahman, from whom proceed the creation, the sustenance and the destruction of the world- this world is a mixture of various sentient and non- sentient beings whose enjoyment of the pleasure and pain, has been settled. In this Sutra, the word, 'from whom' is used in the ablative case to mean the causality in general; because it is applied in common to the creation, sustenance, and destruction (of the universe). His causal- ity in production includes his being the efficient cause. as well as the material cause. It is so, because the Vedic statement ' From whom etc. is common to both.

To the question-how is it? the reply is this-There is a clear reference to Him as being the cause of the creation, etc. (of the world ) in the expression ' from whom etc. ' as if He were a well-known celebrated Being. His celebrity in- cludes the twofold causation said above. (Consider) the text ' Existence alone, my dear boy, this was in the beginning one only, without a second. . . . It thought ' May I become many and be born'. It created Tejas' (Chānd. VI-2-1 & 3). Here the expression 'Existence alone this was in the begnning one only' proves that He is the material cause. ( of the Universe). The expression ' without a second ' refutes a different substratum. Hence it becomes known that the Brah- man, who is denoted by the word 'existence' is both the efficient cause and the material cause (of the Universe). It is known also from the scriptual text "It thought ' May I become many and be born" that He did resolve to assume many variegated forms of sentient and non-sentient beings and then He did create (the Universe). Therefore the expression 'from whom' is used in the scripture with the ablative case in this sense of causality in general,८

In this text (Brahmasutra) itself the fact that the Brahman is both the material cause and the efficient cause (of the Universe) has been objected on the ground of logical con- tradiction and of the specific statement in the Vedic text, viz. "The magician created the Universe from this" (S'vet. IV-1-9 ) and subsequently maintained after refuting the objection in the Sutras I-4-23 to 26. 
How then does the Brahman-who is omniscient and omnipotent, who wills the truth and who has discarded all things unworthy to be of human pursuit as He himself being not tainted with evil-create the Universe, which is a mixture of various wonderful sentient and non-sentient beings? The author of the Sutras1 himself will raise this objection and answer it. He raises the objection in Sūtras II-1-8 and II-1-21 and answers it in Sutras II-1-9 and II-1-22. 
The individual self is declared to be distinct from the Brahman in the series of scriptural texts and smṛti passages stated below :-

'The destructible is the Pradhana or Prakṛti; the immortal and the indestructible is the Hara (i.e. the individual self) and the Lord alone rules over the destructible Prakṛti and the individual self' (S've. I-10). 
The enjoying soul is said Hara because he takes the non- sentient things for his enjoyment.

• These are two Puruşas in the world, the destruc- tible and the indestructible. The destructible represents all beings, while the indestructible is said to be the unchanging one' (Bh. Gītā XV-16 ). But other than these, is the Highest Puruşa called the Supreme Soul, who as the eternal Lord, supports the three worlds, having entered them. ( Bh. Gita XV-17 ).

Because I transcend the destructible beings and am also higher than the indestructible Jiva, am I celebrated in the world and in the Veda as the Supreme Person ( Bh. Gita XV - 18 ) . 
The Brahman is Superior than and distinct from the individual self, who experiences distress and sorrow which are not fit to be the scope of human pursuit. The Brahman has for His body the individual selves and He is their Self. This fact has been established by hundreds of scriptural passages such as (a ) “ Remaining in the self + has the self as His body" (Madhy-) and (b) "He is the inner self of all beings; He is devoid of all pains; He is the Divine Lord; He is the only one God Nārāyaṇa (Sub. VII). Though the embodied soul assumes the state of an effect, yet he is not tainted with evils of the effect, because the good and bad attri- butes are restricted in each case. There are illustrative exam- ples for this. Therefore the Brahman is not tainted with evils. Hence there is no absurdity in the passages of Vedānta. This has been asserted in Sūtra 2-1-9. The illustrative example is

this :-- The self, that has a body, is denoted by various words, such as god, man etc. It assumes the various states of child-hood, youth, old age, etc. Yet the child-hood, youth, old age etc. are the faults that are attached to the body. They do not touch the self. In the same way the pleasure etc. that are closely attached to the self, do not touch the body. Therefore, the Brahman, both in the states of effect and cause, has the individual souls as His body and is the Self of those individual souls. Therefore the Brahman is denoted by the word, denoting the individual soul. Then it is right to state that the word, soul applies to the Brahman, because the Brahman and the individual selves co-exist in the same grammatical equa- tion. In order to reason this fact, two other schools that have to be refuted have been stated in Sutras I-4-20 and 21 and the Siddhānta views of reasoning are advanced in sūtra I-4-22. In the scriptural text, 'Having created it, He entered into it; having entered into it, He became the sentient and the

non-sentient beings. ' ( Tait. II-6-1), it is seen that He remains in the position of the Self to all individual selves. Hence, the Brahman is denoted by the word, denoting the individual soul. It is also stated that He is mentioned as being co- extensive in the same grammatical equation with the individual soul. The inequalities in creation as god, men, etc. are caused by the Karmans done by the individual selves. This is' asserted in Sūtra, II-1-34. The individual souls and the stream of Karmans that is attached to them, have not a beginning. This is asserted in Sutra 2-1-35. That they have not a beginning has been established in the following scriptural texts, "The Eternal among eternals, the Intelligent among the intelligents" (S've. VI-13). "The two, namely, the Intelligent and non-intelligent' (S've. I-9). Though they have not a beginning, yet at the time of the deluge i.e. Pralaya, the sentient and the non-sentient beings, that assume the form of the enjoyer and the enjoyed can not be distinguished by the distinct names and forms. The Sutrakāra has himself stated that the stress of oneness of the Brahman is reasonable. The scriptural text quoted here is this-" Indeed the Self alone was in the beginning and nothing else " ( Ait. 1. I-1 ).२]

That the self is eternal and not produced has been proved in Sutra II-3-18. That knowledge is the essential character- istic of the self has been proved in Sūtra I1-3-19. That the self is atomic in size has been proved in Sutra II-3-20. The self, who is the knower, has been mentioned by the term knowl- edge; because he has knowledge, as his essential attribute and because also he has to be defined and investigated by the means of the attribute, knowledge. This has been stated in Sutras 11-3-29 & 30. In the Sūtra II 3-32 are stated the defects that arise in the schools that accept knowledge as the self, that accept the knowledge produced by other means as the self and that accept the self as being present everywhere. That the self is the doer of good and bad works and not Prakrti has been stated in Sūtras II-3-33 to 39.

Therefore, it is to be granted that the self is a portion of the Brahman, so that the two statements mentioned above will not contradict each other.

The individual souls which are portions of the Brahman, have their own inherent characteristics; but the Brahman, of whom the individuals souls are portions, does not possess those characteristics because the things and their attributes are always found to be distinct from each other in regard to their natural state and inherent characteristics. Thus no contradiction arises in what is stated in Sutras II-3-33 and 40. That the individual souls are portions of the Brahman in the same way as luminosity, etc. is stated by Parasara and others- 
( 1 ) ' The fire remains in one place; but its light spreads all round. In this way, all the worlds are the manifestations of the power of the Brahman' (Visņu I - 22-56).

Otherwise, if it is viewed that the individual souls become a portion of the Brahman due to a certain limiting conditions, that are either of a true or of untrue nature all the faults, intended to be set aside by the Vedanta texts do attach themselves to the Brahman. This has been stated 
in Sutra II-3-49. and so on. 
Therefore, the Brahman has always as his body all the sen- tient and non-sentient beings and is the Self of all those beings. The Brahman is in the state of cause at that time, when His body constitutes the sentient and non-sentient beings without distinct names and froms. He is in the state of effect at that time, when His body constitutes the sentient and non-sentient beings with distinct names and forms. Though the sentient and the non-sentient beings are the body of the Brahman ; yet the sentient and the non-sentient beings, who form the body of the Brahman, do undergo changes and are the seat of the evils. Even then, the Brahman who is the Self of these objects, is the ocean of auspicious qualities, such as knowledge, bliss, etc. which are innumerable, unsurpassable

universe. 
Consider the scriptural text-Existence alone, my dear boy, this word was in the beginning one only, without a second. It thought may I become many and be born' (Chand. VI- 2-1 ). The meaning of this text is this — That Brahman has always all the sentient and the non-sentient beings as the body has been proved by the following scriptural texts- 
( 1 ) ' He, whose body is the self' (Mādh. Brāhmana). (2) 'He, whose body is the indestructible one, He, whose body is the earth, He, whose hody is the Avyakta, He is the inner Self of all beings; He is devoid of sins, He is the Divine Lord, He is the One Nārāyaṇa' (Sub. VII - 1).

It in the beginning i.e. at the time of the deluge, remained only one having as Its body all the sentient and non-sentient beings in a subtle form, and did not manifest Itself as having a distinct name and form. The Brahman Himself who is omniscient and omnipotent, remained without a second, not requiring any other efficient 
cause. 
The meaning of the scriptural text, 'It thought-May I become many and be born' (Chānd. VI- 2-1 ) is this - The Brahman remained only one having as His body, all the sentient and non-sentient beings, that had neither name nor form in their subtle state. It thought of becoming many by assuming a gross form, that has a distinct name and form. The words, ' May become ' and ' Be born indicate respectively the distributive and aggregate forms of creation. All Vedāntins accept this doctrine viz-At the time of deluge, the intelligent and the non-intelligent beings do assume a subtle and indes- cribable difference from the Highest Person. Other Vedantins also accept the difference between them produced by ignorance. or limiting conditions as beginningless. Here the peculiarity is this: In the other schools the Brahman becomes ignorant and is associated with limiting conditions. This is opposed

That (viz. the fact that the scriptures form alto- gether the source of the knowledge relating to the Brahman) results, however, from (His constituting) the true purport (of the scripture ). 
His constituting the true purport of the scripture is the same as His being the object of human pursuit. Though the function of the proof, known as scripture, ends in determining the object of human pursuit ; Yet the Brahman, who is experi- enced equally by Himself and others in His natural state, in His peculiar characteristics and in His great splendour, is of unsurpassed bliss and this is intended to be denoted by the S'astra. Therefore it is quite right that Brahman could be proved by the S'astra. Thus there is no any defect.

time He is in the form of the universe, as He is its material cause also. This fact has to be determined by the Sastras only as the inferential reasoning is incapable of proving it. He is the highest object of human pursuit; because His essential characteristic constitutes the unsurpassable bliss. Therefore the Vedantas surely teach about Him. This fact has been firmly established before. Then in the rest of this Pāda it is stated that as the Prakrti and the individual selves are not fit to be mentioned as the cause of the world. The Vedantas teach about the Brahman only, who is omniscient, who possesses a true will, who is hostile to all evils such as ignorance etc. and who is the ocean of innumerable noble qualities. 
Of these, the author first states that the Prakṛti could not be mentioned in the Vedanta as the cause of the world.

Because the predicative root, Iks is used (in connection with the activity of what constitutes the cause of the world) that which is not in the scope of the scripture alone (viz. the Pradhana or Prakrtı,) is not (referred to in the scriptural passage relating to the cause of the world).

The meaning is that the Pra- dhāna, is not apprehended by the Vedanta. Why? Because the root Iks (to see, i.e. to think) is used. That is because the root, Iks is used in the scriptural passage 'It thought May I become manifold and be born (Chānd. VI- 2-3 ) to denote the activity of the universal cause; closely related to what is stated in the text, 'Existence alone, my dear boy, was in the beginning, one only without a second ' (Chānd.

In fact as regards fire etc. also the power of seeing is not to be explained in a figurative sense, because the words fire etc. denote the Brahman only who has them as His body. All these objects are distinguishable as having a name and form; because the Brahman has entered them, through the individual souls which constitute His body. It is because there is the statement, 'Indeed entering in the form of the individual self, I evolve the differentiation of names and forms' (Chānd. VI-3-2). The intelligent and the non-intelligent substances are separately stated in the text Having created it, He entered the same; Having entered it, He became Sat and Tyat ( intelligent and non-intelligent ), describable and not describ- able, the support and supported, the animate and inanimate, the truth and untruth.

Consider the school that accepts Brahman, who is different from the Pradhana, to be the cause of the world.

is; when any person is known to be asleep, he is then in union with the Sat. He withdraws into his Self. There- fore they say, he sleeps; because he is absorbed into His Self (ie into the Brahman )' (Chānd. VI- 8-1 ) - declares that the individual self, who is asleep and is in union with the Sat, has withdrawn himself to his Self. Hence it is known that what is denoted by the word Sat, is an object other than the Pradhana. The expression,' Has withdrawn. himself to his Self' means becomes merged or absorbed into his Self. 
It is declared in the scriptural passage relating to the differentiation of names and forms, that the Brahman Himself, who has the intelligent and non-intellegent beings for His body and forms their selves, is denoted by the word self which ordinarily means the individual self. By means of the statement, 'He is then in union with the Sat; He with- draws into his Self' (Chand. VI-8-1), it is taught that the Brahman, who is denoted by the word mentioning jiva, is free from any association with names and forms at the time of deep sleep also, as He is at the time of universal

To the same effect, it is stated in a similar context elsewhere that, owing to his (i.e. the individual self) not being associated with names and forms, he is embraced by Him who is omniscient; and consequently it is said. that, when he is embraced by the omniscient Self, he does not know anything that is external or internal' (Brh. IV-3-21). Indeed till his final release the individual. soul is associated with names and forms; and it is, therefore, there is born in him the knowledge of objects other than himself. At the time of deep sleep he certainly gives up names and forms, and is embraced by the Sat (i.e. by the Brahman); and again in waking state, he becomes associated with names and forms and becomes possessed with various names and forms. This is clearly stated in other scriptural passages, namely,' When he (i.e. the individual self) is deeply asleep, he sees no dreams whatsoever, and he be- comes one wholly with the Prāna (Brahman ) . ' (Kaus. II. 30 ) . 'From that Self, the Prāṇās (i.e. Jīvas) proceed towards their own places' (Kaus. II-34 ). To the same effect is the

Therefore that the cause of the universe is the Brahman who is all-knowing Highest person and distinct from the inanimate Pradhana, stands firmly.

। 
That, which is denoted by the term Anandamaya ( is the Brahman); because there is (in the context), the repetition of various grades (of bliss which culminate in the Anandamaya or the Highest Bliss). 
No doubt the individual self, that possesses intelligence and that is different from the Pradhana, has the power of seeing; yet the individual self, neither in the state of bondage nor in the state of final release, can be the cause of the universe. The scriptural text beginning with 'From the same self, the spatial ether came into existence' and ending with 'Different from this Vijñānamaya, is the Inner-Self Ananda- maya (Tait. II-1-1) declares that the Anandamaya men- tioned as the cause of the universe, is the all-knowing Highest

Self, who is other than the individual soul. Why? Because of the repetition. Because there is repetition of the bliss in various grades which culminates in the Anandamaya and which (bliss) forms the summits of unsurpassable condition. This Anandamaya of the unsurpassable condition is repeat- edly mentioned in the text, for meditation The hundred- fold of the bliss of Prajapati is equal to the single bliss of the Brahman (Tait. II-8-4), 'Wherefrom speeches together with the mind return not having reached it. He who knows the. Brahman's bliss fears not from anything' (Tait. II-3-8). 
14. Vikarasabdanneti cenna pracuryat 
It may be said that owing to there being the affix (Maya) significant of modification, (the Anandamaya is) not (the Brahman); but it is not (right to say ) so because that (affix Maya) signifies abundance. 
The affix Mayat means modification in the context 'That this person is Annarasamaya (i.e. the modification of

the essence of food)' (Tait. II-1-3). Therefore, the term Anandamaya also means the modification of bliss. Hence Anandamaya is not the Highest Self, that does not undergo modification. It is not so. Because there is contradiction of the purport, the affix Mayat is understood to mean here 'abundance'. The scriptural text 'From that very same Self, the spatial ether came into existence' (Tait. II-1-1) refers to the Self, that does not undergo modification. The notion that the affix Mayat denotes modification, has been given up already in the case of Prāṇamaya. Following this argu- ment, it should be accepted that the Anandamaya is only the Highest person; because there is an abundance of bliss in Him.

Because also this Ānandamaya is declared (in the contex) to be the cause of that (which forms the bliss of the individual selves).

be doubted that the term Vijñānamaya means mere intellect on the ground that the Vijñanamaya is mentioned as mere intellect in the text' Vijñāna (intellect) performs the sacrifice' (Tait. II-5-1). The Sutrakāra himself will clear this doubt in Sutra II-3-35. In the seriptural text The intellect per- forms the sacrifice (Tait. II-5-1), the word intellect denotes the individual self who is the agent of the sacrifice. If the word, Vijñāna means intellect alone and not the individual self, then the reading of the text would be in a different way; because intellect is only an instrument of action.

It should not be doubted that the Anandamaya, who is the cause of the world, omniscient and blissful is understood to be an individual self endowed with extraordinary merits and not the Supreme Self, because he is said to have a body.

I-6-6). Why? Because His attributes are declared in the context. The attributes of the Highest Person, who is other than the individual self, are (a) His unlimited Lordship over all the worlds and all the desires (b) His not being under the influence of Karman. The scriptural authorities are- He is the lord of all the worlds

That knowledge, etc. are His attributes is clearly seen in the scriptural texts- (1) The Brahman is the Reality, Knowledge' (Tait. II-1-1). ( 2 ) ' He, who knows all and understands all ' ( Mund. I-1-9 ). (3) His supreme power is declared, as varied and natural as well as His activity with knowledge and strength,' (Svet. VI- 8). That He has a divine form peculiar to Him- self has been stated in the scriptural text,' He is of sun-like lustre and altogether beyond darkness' ( Tait. Ar. III-13-1 ) .

Then in the next sentence 'His form is artificial and is assumed to bless His devotees because He displays His sovereign power he (the Vakyakāra) introduces for refutation the view that His form must be a phase of effect or it must be illusory. Then (he himself) replies thus-' His form is indeed beyond the reach of the sense-organs; because it is mentioned to be perceived by Antahkarana (or inner sense.'

It cannot be apprehended by the eye; but could be apprehended through the mind, which must be free from impurity, by one, who has resorted to a different means of attaining Him'.

scripture describes things as they are. This is also because in a different context, it is stated about the Universal witness thus--' The form of this person is like a saffron coloured robe ( Br. II-3-6 ) I know this great Person of sun-like lustre ' (Tait-Ār. III-12-7). This passage also is found in the work Vākya. The phrase He is the Golden Person is to be explained on the similarity of colour of both, like in the case of the expression ' moon-face'. Dramida himself, has com - mented upon the passage thus - The affix, mayat, is not used in the sense of modification; because the Self is not pro- duced'. Thus the Vedanta texts determine the Brahman, who is other than the Pradhana and the individual self. He has unlimited omniscience (Vipas'cittva), whose natural characteristic is unsurpassed bliss, who possesses a divine form that is peculiar to Him, and not made of matter He is the Highest Person and the cause of the world. Thus there is not any defect.

That He is above all the Vedas is stated in the scriptural text, He, who dwelling within all the Vedas, etc.' That He is above all sacrifices is stated in the text, 'He, who dwelling within all the sacrifices.' All these texts are found in Antaryämi- brāhmana. The Subālopanisad passage, beginning with ' who is moving within the earth' and proceeding who is moving within Ayakta, who is moving within Aksara (imperish- able), who is moving within Mytyu ( death), whose body is Mṛtyu, whom Mrtyu does not know. This is the Internal Self of all beings. This is free from all sins. He is the Divine Lord, He is the one Nārāyana' (Subā. VII - 1 ) points

For the same reason (which has been given in the case of Akasa), He, who is denoted by the word Prāṇa (also in the context is the Brahman).

Consider the texts, 'All these beings are, indeed, born out of the Ākāsa; they go unto the Akasa at the end'. (Chānd. 1-9-1). All these beings, indeed, enter into the Prāna and are evolved out of the Prāna' (Chānd. I - 11-5).

' 
The doubt, that arises here, is this :- These passages distinctly specify with the terms Akāsa and Prāṇa, the universal cause mentioned in the text 'Existence alone, my dear boy, was in the beginning' with general term Sat. Here the terms Akasa and Prana denote the popular ether (one of the five elements) and Jiva functioning with co-operation of vital breath of air. The doubt is cleared thus-In the texts quoted above the words Ha vai (indeed) point out that the reason for accepting the object as the universal cause is well-known. Therefore the cause denoted by the terms Ākāsa and Prāņa must be the Highest Person who is distinct from the popular ether and vital air. Here what is well known is this-The Highest Person is the cause of the world. He became many as a result of His will. He possesses unsurpassed bliss. He grants bliss to the self.

He is other than the Vijñānamaya (the individual self). He causes fear and non-fear to the whole world. He is the Lord of all worlds. He is the Lord of all desires. He is free from all evils. He possesses a divine form, that is peculiar to Him. His eyes resemble the lotus, that blossoms forth, when it is in contact with the rays of the sun. He is all- knowing and He possesses a true will. He is the Lord of the Lord of sense-organs. Therefore, it is right to conclude that the words, Akasa and Prana refer to Him as the cause of the world.

Therefore, the popular Jyotis ( light), alone is to be taken as the cause of the creation, etc. of the world.

If it be so doubted, the reply is this-It is true that in this passage nothing is seen to prove contradiction with the supposition. Yet, in the same context, the passage - All beings make up His one foot; His three feet represent the immortal beings in the Highest Heaven' (Chand. III-12-6) occurs wherein all beings are declared to form the foot of this Highest Person who is in relation to the

And, in the teaching that this Jyotis is one with the digestive heat of the stomach, there is nothing wrong; because the oneness is enjoined for the purpose of meditation for attaining the desired result. The Highest Person is the only cause of the world. He possesses an extraordinary devine colour, that is peculiar to Him and not a modification of the Prakṛti. He possesses a divine form. He is beyond darkness (i.e. Prākṛta world). He has unsurpassed lustre. Hence it is right to say that He who is denoted by the word Jyotis, lives on the back of all the worlds, on the back of everything and also in all the higher worlds than which there is no higher.

In a former passage in the same context, the metre known as the Gayatri is mentioned in the statement 'The Gayatri, indeed, is all this' (Chand. III-12-1). Therefore. the Highest Person should not be taken to have been meant in the passages quoted above. To this question we say This is not SO. It is taught there that the Highest Person is to be meditated upon as similar to Gayatri. The conclusion is that it is impossible for that which is merely a metre to be in the form of all beings. Elsewhere, also a word, which ordinarily denotes a metre, is used to denote other thing in consequence of its similarity with it. Vide the passage beginning with- Now these five and the other five' and ending with ' this same is virāj' (Chānd. IV-3-8).

28. Upades'abhedanneti cennobhayasminnapyavirodhat 
If it be said that, on account of there being a difference between the teachings (given in the context, what is denoted by the word Jyotis) is not the Brahman; it cannot be right to say so; because even in both those teachings there is nothing that is contradictory of each other. 
In a former passage in the same context, namely, 'His three immortal feet are in the Highest Heaven' (Chand. III-12-6), the Highest Person has been pointed out clearly. Here in the scriptural text, 'That jyotis which is beyond the Highest Heaven' (Chand. III-13-7), what is denoted by the oblative case is the light that is related to the Highest Heaven. Hence what is described in the former passage cannot be recognised in this subsequent passage. It is not so;

because there is nothing contradicory in the two statements. For an analogous example there is this instance- The hawk is on the top of the tree' and 'The hawk is above the top. of the tree'. Therefore the purport in both the passages is that He is beyond the Highest Heaven.

That which is denoted by the word Prana (is the Brahman); because it is understood in the context. 
The scriptural text is this:-'Indeed, I am the Prāṇa and the omniscient self; worship and meditate on me as life and immortality" (Kaus. III-2). The doubt that arises. here is this-The above mentioned text teaches that Indra who is known as Jīva (individual soul), is the object of man's meditation which would give him the Mokṣa, most beneficial one. He (Indra ) alone is the cause of the world; because the meditation on universal cause alone is the means of Mokṣa. The scriptural text in support of this is this-

'So long as he is not freed from the body, so long there is delay ; then he will reach the Brahman ' (Chānd. VI- 14-2). 
To this doubt, the reply is this-This Being, who is denoted by the word, Indra mentioned in grammatical equation with the word Prana is the Highest Self characterised above and other than the individual Self. Why? Because it is so understood in the sequal. The particular character- istics of the Highest Self, such as Ananda (bliss ), Ajara ( undecaying ) and Amyta ( immortal) are found in the Being, who is denoted by the words, Indra and Prāņa. This is mentioned in the scriptural passage, 'That same Prāņa is the omniscient self who is bliss, undecaying and immortal' (Kaus. III-9).

In the beginning of the topic there is the statement, ' Know me alone' (Kaus. III - 1 ). Here Indra is denoted as an individual self; because there are statements of attributes such as killing Vṛtra, etc.' The conclusion should also be in consonance with this statement. This is not

because there is in the context the mention of a multitude of attributes belonging to the Self. The phrase the attributes belonging to the self' means the attributes of the Highest Self'. From the beginning to the end of the sentence, it is seen that he who is denoted by the word, Indra, possesses many attributes belonging to the Highest self. The scriptural statements made in the outset, namely, ‘You yourself choose for me that boon, which you think most. beneficial to man' (Kaus. III-1 ) starts with the worship, that is most beneficial to man. That this worship is of the Highest Self is proved in the text, 'Thus knowing Him one becomes immortal here. There is no other path" (Puruşa Sukta 20 ). Similarly, the Supreme Self is the impeller of all activities, in accordance with the passage He Himself induces him to do good work whom He wishes to lead beyond these worlds, etc." (Kaus. III-8).

All the words denote the Highest Self; because the scriptures state that He transforms Himself into a gross being having name and form. In order to make one remember this, the Highest Self is mentioned here by the word, Indra. Vāmadeva and others whe realised this truth of the scriptures state accordingly.

If it be said, that on account of the characteristics of the individual self and of the principal vital air being mentioned in the context, there is no reference to the Brahman here at all, it is replied that it cannot be (right to say) so; because the worship of the Brahman has a three-fold nature; because this three-fold nature of His worship is taken for granted; and because here (ie. in the present context also) that (same kind of worship) may be appropriately referred to. 
C 
The characteristics of the individual self are mentioned in the scriptural texts - I killed the three-headed Tvāstra. ' (Kaus. III-1 ). In the same text are given the characteristics of the vital wind As long as the Prana dwells in this body, so long surely there is life' (Kaus. I1I-2). Therefore it is presumed that the Brahman is not meant here. It is not so. The words referring to the individual self and Prana denote the Highest Self; because the worship of the Brahman has a three-fold nature. In another context also it is meant to serve the object of teaching of

In the following passages, Having entered it, He became the Sat and the tyat' and 'while being the unchangeable one ( Satya) and the changeable one, He has nevertheless remained true to His own nature' (Tait.

The scriptural statement, Departing hence, I shall attain Him' (Chand. III-14-4) denotes the Brahman as the object to be attained and the individual self as the agent who attains. Therefore, the object to be attained is the Brahman, who is other than the individual self.

The scriptural text, 'He is my Self within the heart and smaller than a grain of rice ' ( Chānd. III-14-3) declares the being as dwelling within the minute abode. He is also de- signated as having a minute size. Hence he is not the Highest one. It is not so. He has been so designated only

He is not the individual self, because of the difference mentioned in the text' He is different from him (Jiva) who is different from Akṣara' (Mund. II-1-2). Here the word Akṣara means the Pradhana. The individual self is different from the Pradhana. The Brahman is different from the individual self. Or the scriptural text quoted above may be interpreted thus, taking the two words viz. Akṣarāt and Paratah in grammatical equation (Sāmānādhikaraṇya)— The Lord is different from the Akşara, the 25th entity i.e. the individual self who is altogether distinct from the Pradhāna and its modifications.

I-7), the word, Agni is used. in the same grammatical equation with the word Vaisvānara, he is the abode of the Präṇāhuti (oblation to prana. i.e. vital air) and there is the scriptural text, Abiding within the person'. (S'ata. Br. 10-6-1-11) Hence he is not the Highest Self. To this objection, this is answer. It is not so; because it is taught that He has to be meditated upon as having the fire of the stomach, as His body. Moreover the fire in the stomach cannot have the three worlds, as its body. The scrip- tural text of the Vajasaneyins, 'This is the Agni Vaisvānara same as the Puruşa' (S'ata. Br. 10-6-1-11) teaches that the Vaisvānara is the Person. The word, Person, without any limiting conditions attached to it, applies only to the Lord Nārāyaṇa, the Highest Self. This is said clearly in the text, beginning with The thousand-headed God' and ending with, 'All this universe is the Person,' (Tait. II-II-1).

The word ' Agni directly refers to the Highest Self, as He takes the foremost part among gods. Therefore, Acarya Jaimini opines that nothing is contradicted here.

the sacrificial altar etc. So that the Praṇahuti (oblation to Prāṇa) which forms a helpful part of the Vidya (medi- tation) may serve the purpose of Agnihotra. This is the opinion of Jaimini. The scriptural text in support of this view is this He who offers the Agnihotra knowing it thus' (Chand. V-24-2). These views are acceptable. The names of Acaryas are mentioned as a mark of respect. 
33. Amananti cainamasmin 
Moreover, they record Him in this. 
They recite the following scriptural text, Viz. 'The brightly shining heaven is the head of the Self' (Chand. V-18-2) and opine that the Highest Self should be meditated in the body of the devotee at the time of Praṇāhuti (the offering of the oblation to Prāṇa). The conclusion is that the head etc. of the devotee is the head etc. of the Highest Self.

1. Dhyubhvadyayatanaṁ Svasabdat 
The abode of heaven, earth etc. (is the Highest Self), on account of (the use of) the term that refers to Him. 
In the Scriptural text-'In whom the heaven, the earth and the sky are woven' (Mund. II-2-5), it is stated that He is the abode or support of heaven, etc. Here the Highest Self is so meant, because in the same text the word, ātman (Self) is used viz.—' Know Him alone as the one Self ' ( Mund. II-2-5 ) . The aspect of being the Self without any condition, has to be applied only to the Highest-Person. This fact has been supported by the scriptural text 'He is the Setu (bridge) to१]

Immortality' (Mund. II-2-5). The scriptural text, 'Becoming many' (Mund. II-2-6 ) does not exclude Him as possessing the characteristics of the Highest Self. The S'ruti passage Though unborn, He is born as many' (Tait. Ar. III-13-1 ) teaches that He is not born due to His past actions; but He is born as and when He desires, on account of the love that He bears towards His dependants. 
2. Muktopasrpyavyapadesacca 
And on account of His being declared that to Him the released souls have to resort. 
'Then, the knower shaking off good and evil and free from stains, attains the highest equality' (Mund. III-1-3). ' So the knower being freed from name and form, goes to the Heavenly Person, who is higher than the high' (Mund. III-2-8). Here it is declared that He is to be attained by those, who are freed from good and evil as well as name and form. Hence the Highest Person is to be taken as referred to here.

It is not the Anumāna (Pradhana), on account of absence of words denoting it; and so also it is not the bearer of the Pranas (i.e. the individual self).

The meaning is this : - Just as this is not the Pradhāna, because there are no words in the context to indicate it, so also this is not the bearer of the Pranas (i.e. the individual self). 
4. Bhedavyapadesat 
On account of the declaration of difference. 
The Highest Person is meant here, because He is men- tioned as different from the individual self. This is proved in the text, 'The individual self being influenced by the impotent Prakṛti, becomes ignorant and feels sorry. When he sees the other, the Lord, pleased well and His greatness then becomes relieved from grief,' (Mund. III-1-2).

Hence, the Highest Self is referred to in the context.

The scriptures state- The pleasure alone is to be inquired into' (Chand. VII-22). 'The Bhuman alone is pleasure' (Chānd. VII-23). Then it narrates the nature of the Bhūman thus 'Where one sees nothing else, hears nothing else, knows nothing else, that is the Bhūman' (Chānd. VI1-24). That is called Bhuman, while experiencing which pleasure one does not see anything else as pleasure, does not hear anything else as pleasure and does not know anything else as pleasure; because there is the scriptural text, 'But where one sees something else, hears something else, knows something else, that is the little' (Chānd. VII - 24 ). In the Mahā- Bhārata it is stated thus —— The celestial heavenly chariots moving unrestrained, halls, the pleasure grove of various kinds and the lotus-pools of crystal water-All these, Oh dear, are hells when compared with that abode of the Highest Self' (S'ā. 196-4). But he is Ativädin who makes a supreme declaration by the means of the Truth' (Chand. III-16). The fact that he is Ativâdin

could be reasonably maintained only on the acceptance of this fact. The Ativadin (i.e. one, who speaks on High) is one, who is the object of his devotion, speaks of it as highly beneficial to man. The word Bhuman, that is the counter term of the 'little' speaks of the abundance of pleasure, possessed by Him as stated above. What is denoted by the word Bhuman, is the Highest Self; because the Bhuman is said greater than the individual self. The word, Sam- prasāda occuring in the Sutra means the individual self. The scriptural text is this- Then this is the (Samprasāda) individual self' (Chānd VIII-3-4 ). Consider the text, 'But he is an Ativadin, who makes a supreme declaration by means of the Truth' (Chand. III-16). What is taught here is the Person, who is different from and higher than the individual self, who is denoted by the word Prāna.

'Oh Blessed Sir, In whom does He rest? He rests in His own greatness' (Chānd. VII - 24 ). From the above mentioned and other scriptures, the attributes, such as (1) resting in His own greatness ( 2 ) being the cause of the creation, etc. of the universe and ( 3 ) being the Self of all objects, are ascertained as belonging to the Highest Person. Hence the word Bhuman, refers to the Highest Person.

The Indestructible (is the Brahman), on account of His supporting that which is the end of Ambara (ether). 
The scriptural text says thus-O Gārgi, Brāhmaṇas call that Indestructible ( Aksara ). It is not gross, not of atomic size' (Brh. 3-8-8). Here what is denoted by the term 'Indestructible' is the Highest Brahman, because He is said to be the support of that which is the end (or the place of merging) of ether. The scriptural passage beginning with '0 Gargi, which is above the sky' (Brh. 3-8-7 ) mentions the

Akasa as the support of all changable things. It is again. questioned In whome is this Akasa woven crosswise and lengthwise ? ' (Byh. 3-8-7 ). In answering the above question the text This is the Indestructible (Akşara)' (Brh. 3-8-8) says that the Aksara is the support of that which is the end of Ambara (ether) contained with wind. The purport of the whole topic is this. The Akasa which is said to be the support of all changable things is identical with the Pradhana or Avyakta, the primitive cause and merging place of Ambara (the ether) pregnant with wind. The Aksara (Indestructible one) which is said to be the support of the Pradhana is the Supreme Brahman. 
10. Sa ca prasasanat 
And this (supporting springs) from command. 
Such kind of support is said to have sprung from the supreme command, in the text, Oh! Gārgi ! In the supreme command of the Indestructible, etc.' (Brh. 3-8-9 ). Hence this Indestructible cannot be the individual self as well.

Here are mentioned the attributes, that are peculiar to the Highest Self. It is also because in the scriptural text, 'The wise sages. know that' (Pras'.

In the subsequent passage, the subtle ether is said to be the support of all the worlds and hence to be of huge size. It is also subsequently said that the city mentioned above is identical with the Brahman who is Truth and that in the subtle ether which is Brahman-city there are several desires (desirable attributes). Then there are inquiries as to what is this subtle ether and what are those desirable attributes. Then the following passage in answer begins with That is the Self, free from evil' and ends with ' whose wishes and purposes come true' (Chānd. 8-1-5). Here the subtle ether is the Highest Self. The desirable attributes are His freedom from evil etc. 
In the passage 'Within that is a small space. What is within that, should be searched for' (Chand. 8-1-1) the subtle ether and the contents thereof are clearly mentioned to be searched for. This fact has been clearly indicated in the scriptural text 'Those who reach the Highest Place by meditating upon Him and His true qualities' (Chand. 8-1-6).प्रथमाध्याये तृतीयः पादः

' Just so, all these people go to this Brahman-world everyday, but they do not know Him' (Chand. VIII-3-2). This scriptural text says that every day all the people not knowing Him, move above the subtle ether i.e. they rest on Him. The word, Brahma-loka is used in the same grammatical equation with the Akasa of the subtle form. The above mentioned two facts help in determining that the subtle ether mentioned here, refers to the Highest Brahman. In the following scriptural statements also it is seen that all people take rest on the Highest Self. 'All these worlds take rest on Him ' ( Kath. II-6-1 ). The people take rest on the Highest Indestructible' (Tait. II-1-3). The word 'Brahma-loka' is used to mean the Highest Person in the scriptural passage 'This is Brahma-loka' (Bṛh. IV-3-33). We need not go for any other external reference to prove this fact;

Certainly, what is referred to in the context is the individual self, as he undergoes the states of wake- fulness, dream, and deep sleep etc. It is not so. The state- ment relates to the individual self of whom the true nature has become manifest. The qualities, such as 'freedom from evil, etc.' are concealed by the association of the bodies, that are the products of Karman ( past actions ). When subse- quently they (i.e. the released souls) reach the Highest Light, then, their true nature manifest themselves and they possess the qualities, such as, 'freedom from evil etc.' Such an individual self is mentioned in the text mentioned above. But the Akäsa of the subtle form is mentioned as an ocean of many auspicious qualities, that could not be ever hidden. Hence, the word, ākāsa, does not refer to the individual self.

'The individual self, having left this body reaches the Highest Light and regains his own form' (Chānd VIII - 3-4 ). The above mentioned text states that the individual self regains his own nature when he reaches the Daharākāsa (the subtle ether). Thus the text refers to the Jiva, only for the purpose of explaining the power of the Highest Self in granting the individual self his essential nature.

If it be said that the scriptures declare that He is small; this objection has been replied already. 
This is not the Highest Self, because the scriptures state that He occupies a small place and that by nature He is very small. Here the reply has been given already-' Because the Brahman has to be meditated upon in that manner, and because in the same passage the Brahman is said to be like ether ' (Sutra . I-2-7 ).

The illustrious Badarāyaṇa thinks thus-Even the gods, who are above men, meditate upon that Brahman, because they also are regarded as suppliants. Such a thing is possible for them, as they do not lose the memory of the knowledge, that they have acquired formerly. In the Mantras and Arthavādas of the Veda, the deities are praised as possess- ed with body. In order to justify the same, the existence of the body of gods should be accepted on the authority of the same Vedic passages.

Suppose the gods have bodies. Then the individual god cannot be present at the same time in all places. Hence, there arises the contradiction as regards the ritual works. It is not so; because it is seen that Saubhari and others have 
assumed several bodies at the same time.

If it be said (that a contradiction will occur) with regard to the words (i.e. scriptural statements); we say no, since beings originate from them (as appears) from perception and inference. 
A contradiction will occur in the scriptural statements. Because the bodies of Indra and other gods are effected with several parts, they are not permanent. The Vedic words denot- ing Indra, etc. are totally devoid of meaning during the periods, which preceed the origination of Indra etc. or follow on their destruction. And also the Veda itself will be non-eternal. It is not so. The gods Indra etc. are created by the creator with the guidance given by the Vedic words Indra etc. The words, Indra, etc. do not mean any particular individual. But, as in the case of the words cow etc., they represent a class and species that bear the same form. Suppose the previous Indra is destroyed, then the four-faced Brahman remembers the particular form of Indra, etc. of former time and then

The Vedic scriptural authority is this- The creator created the Sat and Asat (the existent and non-existent things) by the guidance of Veda' (Tait. Br. II-6-2.) He said Bhil. Then he created the earth ' (Tait. Br. II-2-4).

(Tait. Sam. 5-2-3). Yet the Vedas, which are full of Mantras, etc. retain their eternity. He the creator remembers with the help of the words of the Vedas Visvamitra and others of the former time, who are capable of repeating the Mantras without teaching. Then he creates the persons having the same name and ability, who could recite the same Mantras assigned to them. This happens after the Naimittika Pralaya. These persons reveal the very Mantras etc. without any fault. Thus it is established that the Vedas are eternal and that the various persons mentioned therein are the authors of the various Mantras. 
How could then the eternity of the Vedas be established, when the Vedas and the creator are destroyed in the material deluge (i.e. Prākṛta Pralaya)? The Sūtrakāra answers this question thus:

Then He hands over to the creator the Vedas, which he remembers in the same order as it was before. It is known from S'ruti and Smrti passages that the first creator created the world in the same form as it was before. The S'ruti passages are these 'The creator Brahman created the sun and the moon as they were before' (Tait. II-1-38) He who created the creator in olden time and gave the Vedas to Him' (S'vet.

Jaimini maintains that Vasu and other divine beings are not entitled to practise Madhu and other meditations (Vidyas) on account of the impossibility. 
In the Madhu and other meditations, Vasu and other gods are to be meditated and they have to be attained, by resorting to those meditations. These gods cannot practise these meditations; because they cannot play at the same time the role of the agent and the object of the same meditation. More over Vasus cannot be the object of desire; because they are Vasus already. Therefore Jaimini maintains that, as they have not the necessary qualifications, they cannot resort to Madhuvidyā etc.

Therefore, what is to be meditated upon there, is the Brahman in both the states of cause and effect.

The preceptor calls the disciple as 'S'udra' at the time of imparting the knowledge of the Brahman as seen in the scrip- tural text, 'You have brought these, Oh S'ūdra' (Chănd. IV-2- 5). It is here indicated that grief arose in the disciple, as he did not possess the knowledge of the Brahman. The word, ' S'adra' etymologically means, one who grieves'. It does not mean him who belongs to the S'udra caste. Why? It is because of hearing a disrespectful speech. The phrase, ' on hearing a disrespectful speech about himself' means— on account of hearing a disrespectful speech about himself, who did not possess the knowledge of the Brahman. In consequence of that, he approached the preceptor. The word, 'hi' used here refers to the cause that led Jānasruti to approach the preceptor. He was called S'udra, not on account his being born in that community. Therefore, it becomes. clear that those, who are born in S'ūdra caste, are not entitled to practise the Brahmavidyā.

APPENDIX TO THE PRAMITADHIKARAŅA 
Having concluded the intervening topic, the Sutrakāra continues the topic on hand-

(Kath. II-3-2). The whole world including Agni, Vāyu, Surya, Indra and so on, trembles from great fear of Him, who is of the size of the thumb and who is denoted by the word, Prāņu, as if the weapon Vajra is raised against it. There- fore the Person of the size of the thumb is determined to be the Highest Person. 
41. Jyotirdarsanat 
On account of the brilliance being seen (used in the text). 
C 
The same context begins with, 'The sun does not shine there' and ends with, By his brilliance all this shines '. (Kath. II-2-15). Here what is denoted by the word, brilliance is the unsurpassable Light. Hence, the Person of the size of the thumb is the Highest Self.

'The Ether is the evolver of names and forms. He who is without these names and forms is Brahman,' (Chånd. VIII-14-1). This ākāsa is the Highest Person, who is other than the pure self mentioned in the context, by the scriptural text, Having shaken off the body,' (Chånd. VIII-13-1) It is because He is designated as the evolver of names and forms and unconnected with them. He is also mentioned as endowed with the above-said attributes and immortality.

On account of differences in deep sleep and departing. 
'Embraced by the intelligent Self, he knows nothing that is without or within ' ( Bh. IV-3-21). 'Mounted by the intelligent Self' (Brh. IV-3-35). Thus it is seen that in the states of deep sleep and departing, the individual

self is ignorant of the external and internal world. But here the distinction manifests itself because the Highest Self is said to be intelligent. Hence this Highest Self is different from the individual self. 
44. Patyadisabdebhyal 
And on account of the use of the words, 'Lord' and so on. 
The embracing intelligent Self is designated upon by the terms, Lord, etc. Hence He is other than the indi- vidual self. Subsequently this scriptural text occurs, 'He is the Lord of all, the overlord of all and the Ruler of all', (Brh. IV-4-22). The doubt about the identity of the individual self with the Brahman will be set aside in the Sūtra I-4-22 explaining the oneness due to the fact that He is the Self of these individual selves that are His body.

In the scriptural text belonging to some of the Vedic seers (ie. Kathas) the Pradhāna, that could be proved by inference, is stated to be the cause of the world. The text is this- Beyond Mahat is the Avyakta (or unmanifest Prakrti ( Kath. I-3-11 ). It is not so. The scriptural text,

There the body which is mentioned as chariot should be taken as meant by the word Avyakta. Consider the text,' Higher than the senses are their objects etc.' (Kath. I-3-10). Here the objects are mentioned as higher in the matter of control. The subsequent passage, viz. The intelligent should supprss his speech and mind' (Kath. 1-3-13 ) teaches the same thing.

2. Sukşmam tu tadarhatvat 
But the subtle is the body; on account of its capacity. 
The Avyakta (i.e. the unevolved Prakṛti), that is of subtle state, assumes the state of the body, and is capable of entering into activities. Therefore the word, Avyakta, denotes the body. 
If the things that are mentioned metaphorically are meant here, then why is it stated thus, 'Higher than the Avyakta is the Person (Kath. I-3-11 ) ? The Sūtrakāra says in reply thus-११८

Matter in its subtle state subserves an end, on account of its dependence on Him (viz. the Supreme Person). 
The individual selves and the body etc. are dependent on the Highest Person. Hence they serve the purpose of helping for the perfection of the meditation. Indeed the Highest Person, being Inner Ruler, directs all the individual selves, etc. for the meditation. Hence He is one of the means of the meditation and occupies the foremost place of those that must be brought under influence. He is also reachable by the meditators. The scripture states thus, He occupies the highest place. He is the Highest course (Kath. I-3-11).

And on account of the absence of statement of its being an object of knowledge. 
There are no statements to prove that the Avyakta (i.e. unevolved Prakṛti) is an object of knowledge. Hence it cannot be the Avyakta of Kapila's School.

If it be said that the scriptural text beginning with 'It is without sound, without touch' and ending with 'knowing it.' (Kath. 1-3-15) declares that Avyakta is the object of knowledge, it is not so. The intelligent Self is referred to in the scriptural text 'Knowing Him' who is read in the context of the passage That Highest place of Visnu' (Kath. 1-3-9 ).

It cannot be said, that on conside- ration of the derivative meaning, viz. the absence of birth, the Prakṛti alone is understood here, because in this context, the word Aja has not been used in any particular sense, as in the case of the word Camasa used in the text, The Camasa with downward mouth' ( Bh. II-2-3). Here the word Camasa, is used in a special sense. The scriptural text in support of this is this - It is the head' (Brh. I1-2-3).

The Taittiriyas read in their text that the Aja had the Brahman for its cause. The text begins with 'smaller than the small, greater than the great, etc. ' ( Tait. 11-10-1) and ends with, From Him the seas and the mountains etc. ( Tait. 11-10-3). This proves that everything is born from the Brahman and has the Brahman for its self. In the context of the elucidation of this truth they read the text — The unborn one etc. ' ( Tait II-10-5). Therefore it is decided that Brahman is the cause of the Prakṛti, because of the remembrance of the teaching mentioned above.

The creation of the Prakrti has been taught in the text, The Lord of wonderful power created this universe out of this' (S'vet. IV-9). Therefore no contradiction arises in Pradhana's being unborn and also

At the time of creation they take name and form and hence they are caused by the Brahman. Consider the following example-In the Madhuvidya it is stated that the sun, at the time of creation, assumes the state of 'honey ' and also the state of effect, as he becomes the seat of those objects, that are pleasing to the taste of Vasu, etc. At the time of deluge, he assumes a subtle form, that cannot be indicated as 'honey' and he does not assume the state of effect. The scriptural texts in support of this are- 
(a ) ' Verily the Sun, is the honey of the gods ' (Chand, III-1-1). 
" 
(b) He does not rise, neither does He set. He remains alone in the middle' (Chand. I11-11-1).

'He, on whom the five Five-things etc.' (Brh. IV-4-17).

The words, 'On Him indicate that He is the support of that Prakṛti and is different from that Prakṛti. He belongs to a different category over and above the twenty-five categories. The objects denoted by the words, ‘ He' and ' āhāsa' are different from the twenty- five varieties ct Prakrti. The word ' even ' used in ' from the mention of the number even' indicates that the number twenty-five is not meant here. The word ' Pañcajana' denotes a class of things known by the name of Pañcajana. Pāņini states-The words denoting direction and number are compounded with nouns provided the compound-word denotes the name of a thing' ( Pānini, II-1-50).

In the text of the Kānrds, the words, food of the food ' are not used. But they begin with the statement, 'Him the gods worship as the light of the lights' (Brh. IV-4-16). Here the word, 'light' used in the context along with the five five-things refers to the sense-organs. The words The light of lights' mean the Brahman who is the Illumi- uator of illuminators. Then the words, 'the five five-things' are introduced. Hence, by the word, 'Pañcajana' we understand the five organs.

Then, indeed, this remained undifferentiated' (Byh. I-4-7). Here the special character- istics of the cause are not apprehended. But the special characteristics of the cause are apprehended in the scriptural text, 'The Self alone was in the beginning. ' It thought, ' may I creat the worlds' (Ait. I-1 ).

In the scriptural texts, 'He enjoys with the individual selves (Kaus. III - 44 ) and Then with this Prāna alone, he becomes one' (Kaus. III-39), the Highest is not referred to ; because there are stated only the distinguishing characteristics of the individual selves and Prāņa. This objection has already been answered in the chapter dealing with the Pratardanavidya. In consideration of the context, it has

That the individual selves are other than the body has been stated in the scriptural text, 'They two, approached the person, who was asleep' (Brh. II- 1 - 15 ). This statement is intended to teach that the Highest Self is other than the individual selves. This fact has been proved by the question and answer found in other scriptural text. The question is this — ' Where, O Bālāki, did this person sleep ?' (Kaus. III- 35 ) The answer – Then he becomes one with this Prāna' (Kaus. III-39). This answer bears the same idea

The Brahman is the material cause also on account of this truth not being in conflict with the proposition under discussion and the illustrative example. 
The Highest Brahman is also the material cause of the world. He is not the instrumental cause alone. The scriptural text says thus-'You are proud. Did you ever ask about the Ruler (i.e.Adesa) by hearing whom the unheard becomes heard?' (Chānd. VI-1-3). It means By the knowledge of Him, who is the Ruler, all this world of sentient and non-sentient beings

The above mentioned truth should be accepted so that the said proposition and the example may not be contradicted. The word Adesa used in the text. denotes the Ruler; because it means Him by whom the world is ruled over. Thus the word, Adesa, means the Ruling Person.

24. Abhidhyopadesacca 
Because also of the statement of His thought. 
" 
He thought may I become many' (Chānd. VI-2.3). This scriptural text proves that the Person, who possesses the character of thinking and who is the instrumental cause, transformd Himself into the form of the world, consisting of various sentient and non-sentient beings through His will. Hence, it is known that He is the material cause also of the world.

How can this contradiction be averted? The author of the Sutras answers this question thus-

It is so owing to the modification. 
No contradiction arises, as the scriptural text here teaches the modification. The Highest Person in the causal state has as His body the sentient and non-sentient beings in a subtle state, that cannot be distinguished with distinct name and form. He wills then that the sentient and non-sentient beings, that are His body, should have distinct names and forms. Then He separates from Himself all the sentient and non-sentient beings, that constitute His body in a subtle state. The scriptural authority is this He desired May I become. many' (Tait. 1-2-6-2 ) ' He created all this' (Tait. I-2-6-2). He entered the sentient and non-sentient beings that constitute His

There is the desire to look into other texts for support in order to determine the meaning of the Vedanta passages. Accordingly Vedānta passages, by the support of the Kapila- Smrti, must determine the Prakyti to be the cause of the

It is true that the Vedic texts require Smrti works for support *; however when there are many other Smrti works agreeable to the Vedic texts, the Smyti that is opposed to the Veda, cannot be considered as the work for support. 
But Kapila, the greatest of the sages, does not accept that doctrine of the other Smytis. How then is it right to say that other Smytis are the works of support? The answer is this-

The world possesses the character of undergoing the changes of states. It is ignorant and the seat of evils which are not fit to be in the scope of desire of men. Hence on account of the difference of character, the world cannot be the effect of the Brahman.

From these texts it is seen that the earth, etc., had certain functions which were possible only for those, endowed with knowledge. However it should be explained that the functions were of the presiding divinities, because the word, divinities, is used in the text to qualify them, 'Alas! Let me enter these three divinities' (Chānd. VI-3-2). The divinities that preside over the

On account of similar consequences in absorption, the Vedanta texts would be inappropriate. 
As the Brahman and the world constitute one substance, it happens, that the Brahman, like the world, must undergo modification during the absorption of the world in Him. Therefore all the Vedantic texts become inappropriate. 
9. Natu, drstantabhavat 
Not so; as there are parallel instances. 
It is not so. That the Brahman has, as his body, all the sentient and non-sentient beings has been proved in the scriptural texts, ' To whom the self is the body' (Bl. V-7-22 Mādhya) To whom the Avyakta (the unevolved matter) is he body' (Sub. 7). There are instances to show that good and bad qualities exclusively belong to Him and His body, while He remains in the state of both the cause and the effect. The illustrative example is this:-'The man, in whose body

is encased the individual self, undergoes the changes of childhood, youth, and old age etc.' The childhood, youth etc. are the characteristics of the body. The pleasure, knowledge, etc. stick on to the self alone. In the same way the ignorance, different modifications etc. belong to the sentient and non- sentient beings, that constitute His body. The Brahman, who is the self of these sentient and non-sentient beings, is faultless and all-knowing. He does not undergo changes and possesses true will.

And on account of objections to one's own view, (i.e. of the Samkhya system). 
The Vedantic view alone has to be accepted, as there are faults in the Samkhya view that accepts the Pradhana as the cause of the creation etc. of the world. In the school, that accepts Pradhana to be the cause of the creation, etc. of the world, it is stated thus-The Pradhana undergoes changes in the presence of the Purusa, who always remain immutable'.

The argument, namely, 'The Pradhana is the cause of the creation, etc. of the world' is based on wrong reasoning. The reasoning has not been firmly founded on good basis. Hence, the Pradhana should not be held as the cause of the creation etc. of the world.

If it is desired that the Brahman should be the corporeal Self, because all the sentient and the non-sentient beings constitute His body, then it happens that the Brahman enjoys pleasure and pain, just as the individual self; and because He has a body, there should not be any distinction. between the individual self and the Highest Self. It is not so. The Brahman is surely distinct from the individual self, as He possesses a host of auspicious qualities bereft of in- auspicious ones. The experience of unliked things is not due to the connection with the body; but it is due to the fact of being dependant on others. In the world it is seen that the ruler, who is independent, has a body, but does not enjoy the fruits of the violation of his orders as his dependants are compelled to undergo the punishment.

The non-difference of the world from that Brah- man follows from the scriptural statement that begins with the word, Arambana. 
The world which is caused by the Brahman is not different from its cause Brahman. This has been understood by the scriptural text dealing with His assumption of various modifications and having different names for the sake of worldly transactions through the verbal references. The scriptural texts quoted as authority here are-' A clod of clay undergoes changes by assuming different names for the worldly activities through the verbal references; Yet clod of clay only is true' (Chand. VI-1-4.) ' Existence alone, my dear, was in the beginning one only without a second." "It thought, may I become many' (Chānd. VI- 2-1 ). All things that exist have Him as the Self ; ' and That thou art, Oh S'vetaketu'," (Chand. VI-8-7).

The effect exists in the cause. Hence, it is not different from the cause. That the pot or plate had at a former moment the shape of a clod of clay is generally experienced. Therefore pot, etc. are apprehended to be the modifications of a clod of clay.

If it be said, 'not so, on account of the designation of the effect as non-existent, (i.e. Asat)', we reply, not so; on account of such designation being due to another attribute, as appears from the supplementary passage, from reasoning and from another verbal testimony. 
The effect has been designated as a non-existent being at that time, in the scriptural text, ' In the beginning, truly, there

was not anything whatever ' ( Tait. Br. II - 2 - 8). Therefore the effect does not exist in the cause. If such an objection arises, we say - It is not so. The designation as a non- existent being is due to the fact that the thing was with different attribute, namely, with a subtle state which is opposed to a gross state.' Why? It is so apprehended from the supplementary text, That Non-existent formed the resolve, 'may I be' (Tuit Br. II-28 ). Indeed the resolve can be made by that, which is extant. The reasoning also proves that the designation as non-existent is due to the association with a different attribute'. Indeed the substance, namely, The clod of clay, that is known to have an existence always, is designated a non-existent being etc. The illustrative example is this-The pot undergoes the changes and assumes the positive states, such as a clod of clay, the pot and the pieces of pot, that are mutually opposed to each other. By this reason it is generally said that 'This pot was in existence in a former time; it exists in the present time and it shall exist in a future time'. Other scriptural texts in support of this view are, 'Verily this was then un- differentiated' (Bh. 1-4-7) etc.

But on account of the scriptureal authority it is not so; because the Brahman's nature could be appre- hended only by the verbal testimony. 
This objection does not happen as scriptures have been accepted to be the proofs. The nature of the Brahman can be proved only by the means of scriptures. The Brahman is distinct from other objects that could be established by other proofs. Therefore no contradiction arises, if the Brahman is possessed with powers unseen in other objects. Therefore the result is this:-'The Brahman is full in every way of all qualities both in the causal state and in the state of effect.' This is just as the Jati (class) of those who accept it as a separate category, is full in each of the cows with broken horn or hornless.१५८

In the part of the Brahman there is neither the inequality nor the cruelty; on account of the conside- ration of something; for so the scriptures declare. 
While creating the gods and others of different status in life, He is neither partial nor cruel by temperament. The inequality in creation by the Highest Self is due to the Karmans or deeds of the individual selves. This is seen in the scriptural text thus He, who does good work, becomes good; he, who does evil work, becomes evil' (Brh. IV-4-5).

One-ness is apprehended in the scriptural text, 'Existence alone, my dear, was in the beginning ; One only' (Chānd. VI-2-1). At that time, the individual selves were not extant. Hence the Karmans or deeds do not attach themselves to the individual selves. It is not so; as the individual selves have not a beginning, the stream of their deeds also have not a beginning. This is reasonable. The individual selves have not a beginning; yet the scriptural text that states the non-difference, only establishes the non-distinction due to the absence of the name and form. The text is this 'Verily at that time this world was undifferentiated. It became differentiated just by name and form' (Bh. 1-4-7). The view said above is in harmony with this text.

All those attributes, that are impossible in the Pradhana and the atoms, are found in the Brahman; because He is apprehended as being distinct from all other objects. All His powers are proved in the scriptures. Hence, it is established that the Brahman only is the cause of the creation, etc. of the world.

1. Racananupapattesca nanumanam pravṛttesca 
The Anumana (Pradhana) is not the cause of the creation, etc. of the world, on account of the impossi. bility of construction and on account of activity. 
The construction of chariots, mansions, etc. cannot be accomplished by the non-sentient beings, such as wood etc. without being employed by a person, who knows how to do them. And they could be made when they are employed by the person, who knows how to do them. Hence the Pradhana, that is non-sentient being, that could be proved by the inference only and that is not guided by an intelligent person cannot be the cause of the creation, etc. of the world.

If it be said like milk or water; there also the in- telligent guides. 
The milk and the water are not guided by an intelligent person, when they undergo the changes of curds etc. Same is the case with the Pradhana also. The answer is thus-Even in this case the reason of refutation is the same as stated already; because these milk and water also are included in the minor term.

And because from the independence of the Pradha- na, there would be never the reverse of the creation of the world. 
The Pradhana is not the cause of the creation, etc. of the world; otherwise the creation would take place always, as the guidance of the intellegent is not at all required.

Not like grass, etc.; because it does not happen in >ther cases. 
It is not right to say that the Pradhana is the cause of the reation, etc. of the world in the same way as grass, etc. are apable of being modified as the milk when they are eaten by he cows; because in the case of bulls, etc., such a transfor• nation is not seen.

And on account of the impossibility of the prominence with relationship as prominent and sub- ordinate. 
The origination of the world results from a certain relation between the three Gunas as principal and subordinate which depends upon the relative inferiority and superiority. But, as in the Pralaya state, the three Gunas are in a state of equipoise, none of them is superior or inferior to the others. Hence, the creation, of the world would not take place.

And if the inference be made in a different way, the result remains unchanged, on account of the Pradhana being destitute of the power of knowing. 
The expression, Being destitute of the power of know- ing' means, ' Being devoid of the power of an intelligent '. Suppose Pradhana is inferred by some reasoning different from the one so far refuted by us, even then, as it is devoid of the power of knowing the difficulties such as the impossi bility of construction, etc. mentioned in Sutra II-2-1, do firmly stand. 
8. Abhyupagamepyarthabhavat 
On account of the absence of a purpose, even if it be admitted, it should not be inferred.

Completely unintelligible are the views of that school, which hold the doctrine that the Tryanuka which is big and long is formed from the Dvyaṇukas (shorts) and Paramāņus (atoms)." As a rule the parts, that possess six sides, begin the formation of a bigger object in combination. The atoms have no parts. Hence, they cannot have sides. Things such as atoms, that are brought together without any regard to their sides cannot produce a big object.

It is impossible to accept that first motion can originate in the atoms. Therefore the conjunction of two or more atoms is impossible to accept. Though there may be required the maturity of the Adrsta (ie the unseen principle) in the indivi- dual selves, even then, the oceasional motion, that is caused by the Adṛṣṭa, cannot have its origin in the atoms. Suppose the maturity is not required, then the motion should have been pro- duced in the atoms even before. In fact, maturity is not newly produced as a certain attribute in Adṛṣṭa. When regarded as commandments, particular actions yield particular results. Then at that particular time the individual selves attain that fruit. This is called as a maturation. When no particular time is fixed for such fruits, the maturation is the state of being not obstructed by more powerful deeds. Adṛṣṭa has the nature of granting the results, that are dependant upon the nature of the actions. Hence, maturity does not find a fixed place in all the individual selves at the same time; because the various actions grant various results at various times. The Lord can not be proved by the inference. Hence,

The views of the Vaisesikas are also untenable, on account of the acknowledgment of Samavaya; because Samavāya also like the Jāti (class) and Guna ( qualities), requires something else, to prove the fact of its being inseparably connected. From this there arises the fallacy of regressus in infinitum.

And as there are defects in both the cases. 
Suppose the atoms have no colour, because otherwise. they become non-eternal, then the principle ' The properties of the effect are due to the properties of the cause' will have to be abandoned. If they have colour, they must be non-eternal. Therefore the whole argument is untenable; because faults do arise in both the cases.

Not non-existence ; on account of cognition. 
The views held by other school i.e., of Yogacăra, which hold that there are no objects apart from the knowledge, are not correct. What is apprehended in the notion, 'I know the pot, is the thing (pot) that is an object of the knowledge held by the knower. Therefore it is not possible to say that there is no separate thing. The special charactaristic of the cognition is only the capacity of production of the idea. in men with reference to particular objects. 
28. Vaidharmyacca na svapnadivat 
And on account of difference of nature, the waking state is not like dream. 
The knowledge found in waking state is not of unreal nature like the dream; because there is difference in their

Not so, on account of the impossibility in one. 
The views of the Arhat or Jina, are not tenable, because it is not possible for an object to assume simultaneously the states of existence and non-existence, permanence and non- permanence, and separateness and non-separateness. It is also impossible to accept that a substance undergoes different states (Paryayas) simultaneously, because the states such as lumpness, potness, and the state of broken pieces etc. which are said to be the objects of the cognition of existence. and non-existence, are mutually contradictory. The earth, etc. undergo the states of pot, plate, etc. in different parts. It is not possible to apprehend in the same substance, imperman- ence and its opposing nature namely, permanence, because

And on account of the stability of the final size, and the resulting permanency of both, there is no speciality.

The final size' means the size that exists in the state of release'. The self then remains with the same size always which is his natural size. Therefore the self and his size must both be eternal and the soul must be of the same size even in his former stages. Hence it will happen that if the soul is of the size of the various bodies, then he must be imperfect in those bodies.

The activity of the individual selves with the rulership over the organs and body is due to the effect of their past good and bad deeds and is for the sake of enjoyment of pleasure and pain.

Consider the statement - ' From Vāsudeva, there origi- nates the individual self, called Samkarsana'. Here Sam- karṣaṇa and others are said to be Vasudeva whose essential characteristic is knowledge, and who is the origin of the world. Then there can be no refutation of the authoritativeness of the doctrine, that set forth this truth. That the Supreme Brahman Vasudeva takes the incarnation on His own will, is said in the scriptural text. He is unborn ; Yet is born as many' (Tait. Ar. III-13-1). The words, Jiva etc. denote Samkarsana and others, who are encased in those particular bodies.

The spatial ether is not produced on account of the non-hearing of its production. 
The spatial ether is not generated, because there are not heard the scriptural statements on its production. It is not possible to hear from the scriptures the origination of it which has no parts, just as in the case of the self. 
2. Asti tu 
But there is hearing about the production of the spatial ether,

It is heard that the spatial ether is a product. Indeed, the very same scriptural text, which treats of the objects, that are beyond the congnizance of the sense-organs declares that the spatial ether is a product- The Spatial ether is produced from the self' (Tait. II-1-2) But the individual self is known not produced because the scriptural statement 'He is not born' (Kath. I-2-18). 
3. Gauṇyasambhavacchabdacca 
The scriptural text here, has a secondary mean- ing, on account of the impossibility and of the verbal authority. 
Fire is mentioned as the first product in the text, 'It sent forth fire' (Chānd. VI- 2-3 ). Hence, the text, 'The spatial ether is produced' (Tait. II-1-2), is to be taken in the secondary sense. It is so also because there is the text, 'The wind and the spatial ether. This is Immortal' (Bṛh. II-3-3).

4. Syaccaikasya Brahmasabdavat 
A word may be used in different senses, as in the case of the word, Brahman. 
The word, Sambhuta is used in a secondary sense with. reference to the spatial ether, and in its original sense with reference to other objects. This discrimination is quite possible when the same word is referred to in a further text, just as in the case of the word which is actually uttered in other place. Consider the following for instance-The word, Brahman, is used in the secondary sense in the text, ' From Him is born this Brahman, name, form and food' ( Mund. I - 10 ) . Here the word Brahman denotes the Prakṛti in the secondary sense. But in other text it is used in the primary sense; vide 'The Brahman swells on His thought' (Mund. I-9). 
This view is refuted thus-

The proposition, mentioned in the scriptural text, ' By hearing on whom, the unheard becomes heard' is this' The knowledge of one produces the knowledge of all'. This proposition is not discarded, because the spatial ether etc. are the effects produced by the Brahman and they are not different from Him. 
6. Sabdebhyah 
This follows from other texts. 
The scriptural text, namely, 'The ether is produced ' makes one understand that the spatial ether is created. This statement cannot be over-ridden by the absense of the word ' Akāsa' in the text, He produced the fire', which declares that the fire was the first among the creatures.

The effects that are said to have been produced with the mediation of the ether etc. are produced directly by the Brahman. To establish this truth, the Sutrakāra raises the following objections to answer- 
10. Tejotastathahyaha 
Fire is produced thence, for thus the scripture declares. 
The fire is originated from the wind alone and not directly from the Braman, because the scriptural text states thus—' From wind the fire is produced' (Tait. I-2-1-2).

But He is the cause of the creation, etc. of the world; because there are indicative marks namely His contemplation. 
There is the expression in the phrases, 'The fire thought' (Chānd. VI-2-3) and ' The water, thought ' (Chānd. VI- 2-4 ) which resemble more or less the other text' That thought may I become many and furnish the token of the universal cause i.e. Highest Self. This text proves that the Highest Self is the direct cause of the creation, etc. of the world; because He has fire etc. as His body and is denoted by the words fire etc.

The order of succession in a different form is stated in the scriptural text, 'From Him is produced the vital wind, the spatial ether, wind, fire and water' (Kath. II. 1-3).

That between the vital wind (Prāṇa) and elements are produced the sense-organs and mind, is taught in the text-

Therefore this text also states the creation in certain order with mediation. It is not so; because the statement, 'From Him is produced' (Mund.

But the terms which are connected with the things movable and immovable, i.e. denoting those things, are non-secondary (i.e. of primary denotative power, with regard to the Brahman); since their denotative power is effected by the being of that Brahman. 
Those terms which are connected with things movable and immovable, i.e. the terms denoting those things, refer to the Brahman in the non-secondary sense, i.e. in the primary sense. According to the scriptural text 'Let me enter as the soul and separate out name and form' (Chānd. VI. 3- 2 ) the Brahman enters all the things as their soul and gives them separate names and forms. But the people ignorant of this, use the words in a portion of their full meaning.

' etcetera' are apprehended the class, quality and body, that are always known as adjectives. The adjectival attributes form the portions of the objects. Yet no contra- diction arises, in regard to the difference in the essential nature and charactertistics between the objects and their adjectives. The scriptural text says thus- He remains in the selves and has the selves for His body' (Bh. III-7-II Mādhy). 
46. Smaranti ca 
And the Smrti texts declare thus. 
Parasara and others declare that the world consisting of sentient and non-sentient beings is the part of the Brahman and this is similar to the case of the light. The Smrti texts are these The fire is stationed in a place, but its light spreads all round. Thus is the whole world which is the power of the Brahman' (Vis. Pu. I - 22-56 ). All those are Hari's body' (Vis. Pu. 1-22-38 ). All those are His body ' (Vis. Pu. 1-22-86).

Permission and prohibition result from the connec tion with the body, as in the case of the fire etc. 
Though all the individual selves form the part of the Brahman, the permission and exclusion of some of them regard- ing the study of the vedas etc., are possible; because they are ordained in consideration of the connection of each individual self with a distinct body of Brahmana etc. This discrimination is similar to the case of the fire in the S'rotriya's house or in the cremation ground.

And on account of the separateness of each self in each body, there is no confusion.

Should it be said that this is possible owing to the difference of place; we deny this on account of the inclusion of all places in it. 
Suppose it is stated that this is possible, as the Brahman's particular place due to a limiting condition becomes the individual self. It is not so; when the limiting adjuncts move about, all the places of the Brahman become the subject of limitation.

PRĀŅOTPATTYADHIKARANA 1 
1. Tatha Pranal 
Thus the Pranas (sense-organs) also are not created. 
The individual selves are not created; because there are scriptural texts to prove that they are not produced and they are eternal. Same is the case with the sense-organs also. It is taught in the scriptures that, at the time of the Pralaya (the deluge), the Prāņas did exist. The scriptural text is this--' The non-being ( Asat) alone was in the beginning. Those sages in the beginning were, indeed, the Asat (i.e.

It is not so. 
2. Gounyasambhavat tatprakchrutesca 
The plural number is to be considered in a secondary sense; because it cannot be in the primary sense and since the Highest Self alone is declared to have an existence before the creation. 
There are scriptural texts to show that the Highest Self alone was in existence before creation. The words 'sages' and 'Pranas' refer to the Highest Self only. Because He cannot be designated with a word in plural number, in the scriptural statement the plural number is to be considered as used instead of the singular number in a secondary sense.

On account of the speech having for its antecedent the creation. 
The objects, other than the Highest Self, could be designated by names, only after the creation of the fire etc, by the Highest Self. Therefore at that time, the word, Prana cannot refer to the sense-organs.

They are seven on account of the mentioning of movement and of specification. 
The sense-organs are only seven in number. 'The seven Prānās come forth from Him ' ( Mund. II-1-8 ). ' When the five senses of knowledge stand still together with the mind and when the Buddhi does not move' (Kath. II-3-10 ). From the above mentioned scriptural texts it is understood that only the seven senses move with the individual selves and

But the hands, etc. are also the organs; since they also assist the self when he abides in the body. There- fore it is not so. 
Hands, etc. are also organs; because they also assist the self, when he abides in the body. Therefore the organs are not seven only; but they are eleven. The scriptural statement is this- Ten are these organs in person and Atman is the eleventh ( Brh. III-9-4 ) . ' The organs are ten and one' (Bhag. Gi. XIII-5). Buddhi, etc. are different functions of the Manas (mind). The scriptures mention the movement of the seven sense-organs and specify them. This is due to the fact, that they are prominent among the group. '

By the best' we have to understand the Prana (vital wind) with its fivefold function. This also is created. This is mentioned separately again here, so that this may be dealt with in the next Sutra also.

Prāņa is neither the mere wind nor its function ; on account of its being stated separately. 
The Prana, that has five functions, is neither mere wind nor its mere functions; because it is taught separately in the scriptural text 'From Him are produced Prāna, ether and wind' (Mund. II-1-3).२२८

But it is like the eye, etc., on account of being mentioned along with them and for other reasons. 
The Prana is distinct from the mere wind; but it is not an element completely different from it, like fire, etc. The wind itself has taken the form, that is useful in sustaining the body and is helpful for the functions of the individual selves, like the eye, etc.; because it is mentioned in the scriptural text along with the eye, etc. It is also equally help- ing the individual selves, like the eye etc. and is important among them.

With the exception of the best, they are the sense- organs; because they are so designated.

The scriptural text, that states that the Prana is created different from the sense-organs is this- From Him is originated Prāna, mind and all the sense organs' (Mund. II-1-3). It is also thus because the functions of the Prana do not stop, even when the sense-organs cease to function. Hence the sense-organs and the Prana possess distinct characteristics.

But the assignment of the names and forms be- longs to Him, who does Trivrtkaraṇa (combining the three elements); on account of the scriptural teaching. 
The assignment of the names and forms such as gods etc. belongs to the Highest Self alone, who has for His body the four-faced god (the creator ) ; and not to the four-faced god himself. This is so because the scriptural text teaches that the assignment of the names and forms was made by the same who did the Trivṛtkarana (combining the three elements). The scriptural text is this- Let me differentiate names and forms and let me make each of them as combination of the three elements ' ( Chānd. VI-3-2 ). But the four-faced god cannot do himself the Trivṛtkarana. First is created the egg- shaped universe out of fire, water, and food combined together. Subsequently the four-faced god is created. The Smrti text is this 'That egg-shaped universe of golden colour८]

Flesh etc. are of earthy nature; in the case of the other two, it has to be considered according to the

Otherwise the flesh and the mind (Manas) which are smaller in size than the excavated matters, must have 
the character of fire and water. the statements, Food taken is formed into three ' (Chānd. VI-5-1); because the earth alone is said to become into the three (i.e. the food, water, and fire). It also contradicts the statement, ' Oh beloved, ! The mind is Annamaya (the modification,

There he becomes embraced with the water that becomes modified into the body of the nature of Amṛta (deathlessness) and becomes subservient to the gods. There he enjoys the fruits of his actions along with the gods. When his Karmans are practically exhausted he becomes born again in the world of Karman, as Brāhmaṇa, etc. along with a portion of his unspent Karmans which effects.

As the texts, when the speech of the dead goes into fire' (Bh. III. 2-13) etc. declare that when a person dies, his organs go into fire, etc. Hence they do not accompany the individual selves. This question is not correct. Here the words, speech etc., have the secondary meaning, namely the divinities (Agni etc.) who preside over them; because the text continues to sayThe hairs of the body enter into the herbs'. (Brh. III. 2-13). The hairs do not enter with the visible form into the herbs.

If it is said that water alone is understood by the question and answer in this context and not the individual selves, that are embraced by the subtle rudimentary elements; we say it is not so; because in a subsequent passage of the text is men- tioned the route taken by those selves who perform the sacrifices etc. The text is this-'But those who in the village perform sacrifices, dig wells, etc. and grant gifts' (Chānd. V. 10-3). There is another scriptural text 'By that oblation he becomes King Soma' (Chand. V. 4-2). Here that, who is denoted by the word ' water ' connected with the fire of Dyuloka (the heavens),

is mentioned as becoming the King Soma. The same that has assumed the state of King Soma is recognised in the scriptural text 'King Soma' (Chand. V. 10-4). Therefore by the word, water, is meant the individual self, who is embraced with the water and has it for his body. This is what is understood in the scriptural texts.

' He becomes Soma King ; Him the gods eat ' (Chānd. V. 10-4). Here the eating by the gods of the self who has become as King Soma, must be taken metaphorically.

Accord- ingly it has been stated in the text 'He is like an animal for the gods,' (Brh. 1-4-10). This statement reveals that he is the means of enjoyment of the gods. The following૨]

Smrti text also says that the realizers of the Self and the non- realizers of the Self are means of enjoyment of the Highest Person and of the gods respectively-Those, who worship the gods go unto the gods and those, who worship Me, go unto Me' (Bha. Gi. VII. 23- 7 ) .

On the exhaustion of the Karmans, the selves descend with a remainder of Karman, according to the Vedic texts and Smrtis. The descent is by the same route of the ascent and also not so. 
It is understood by the scriptures and the Smṛtis that on the exhaustion of Karmans, the self returns to this world with a remainder of the Karman whose fruits he has not enjoyed. The scriptural text is this — Those, whose deeds are good, are born in good families' (Chand. V. 10-7). The Smrti texts

9. Caraṇaditi cenna, tadupalakṣaṇārtheti Karṣṇājiniḥ 
Should it be said that it is not so on account of the term Caraṇa; not so, since Carana connotes the Karman also: thus Karşṇajini thinks. 
The word, Carana, occurring in the passage Those, whose deeds are good' does not mean the remainder of Karman, because it is generally used in the sense of Smartācāra (i.e., general conduct, described in the Smṛtis). Therefore the self is not followed by the remainder of his Karman. This is not so. In the scriptural text the term Carana connotes the remainder of Karman also; because the pleasure and grief are the result of such Karman only.

No purpose is served as there is no use of the conduct mentioned in the Smṛtis. It is not so; because all the good works are dependent on the conduct. Because it is stated thus - ' He, who does not worship Sandhyā, is always impure, and he is unfit for any religious work'. This is the view of Kārsnājini.

SAMDHYADHIKARANA 1 
1. Samdhye ststiraha hi 
In sleep, the scriptures state, there is creation. 
" 
The word 'sandhya' means 'sleep'. The creation mentioned in the text, Then he creats chariots, horses, roads, etc. (Brh. IV. 3-10) is effected by the individual self. It is so, because the following scriptural text declares the individual self, the experiencer of the dream, as the creator of what he sees in the sleep-' He creats the tanks and streams, as he is the creator ' (Brh. IV. 3-10).

And some state that the individual self is the creator and the objects of creation are the sons etc. 
The followers of some S'äkhä state, in their text, that the individual self is the creator of the objects experienced in dreams. The text is this — He is the person, who is awake among those that sleep and he is creating various Kāmas (desired objects)', (Kath. II. 2-8). What are meant by the word Kāmas here are the sons etc. that are desired; because in the previous passage it is stated thus-Ask for all Kāmas according to your wish'. It is explained further thus' Choose sons and grandsons living for hundred years' (Kath. I. 1-23). 3. Mayamatram tu, kartsnyenanabhivyaktasvarupatvat

True will etc. are the natural characteristics of the individual selves; however, these do not manifest themselves completely when the men are under the influence. of Samsăra. Therefore the creation in dreams is not possible for the selves by their true will. The scriptural texts 'He is the creator' (Bh. IV-3-10 ) and 'The person is creating ' (Kath. II. 2-8), do not refer to the individual selves, because there is the following scriptural text in the same context, 'On Him all the worlds do rest and no one exceeds Him' (Kath. II-2-8).

The characteristics of the individual selves become concealed on account of the will of the Highest; because the individual selves have committed a series of wrongs, that has not a beginning. On account of the wrongs committed by the individual selves, the Lord's will continues. Indeed, the bond - age and liberation of the self do follow His will. The scriptural authorities are these- Then there is fear for him ' ( Tait. I- 2-7). Then he becomes free from fear ' ( Tait. I-2-7 ). 
5. Dehayogad va sopi 
And that is due to the connection with the body. 
The concealment of the natural characteristics of the 
selves at the time of the creation is due to their connection with Acit (the non-sentient Prakrti ), that has assumed the form of the bodies of men, gods, etc. At the time of the Pralaya (the deluge ), the concealment is due to their con- nection with Acit (Prakṛti) that has assumed a subtle state which cannot be distinguished in name and form.

No imperfection arises in the Highest Self, even though He remains as an inner Ruler in the selves during the four states, such as the waking, etc. In the scriptures and in the Smṛtis it is heard that the Highest Self possesses the two fold characteristics, namely, the total absence of all the im- perfections and the possession of all good qualities. The texts are - He is free from evil and possesses true will' (Chānd. VIII-1-5). 'Without any stain' (S'vet. 6-19). 'He, who under- stands all and knows all' (Mund. I-1-9). 'He, in nature, is full of all the auspicious qualities' (Vish. Pu. VI- 5-84). Where all evils, sufferings etc. do not exist ' ( Vish. Pu. VI- 5-85).

Should it be said on account of different states, the imperfections cling to Him; it is not so, because with reference to each of the states, the texts say that the evils are not in Him. 
The imperfections do cling to the individual selves, though they are in nature devoid of those imperfections; because the selves are connected with different bodies. In the same way the imperfections cling to the Highest Self also, as He is connected with bodies as stated in the text, 'whose body is the earth' (Bņh. V-7-3) and so on. It is not so. As regards the state- ment, — whose body is the earth', there is the counter-statement, ' He is Your Self, the inner controller and the immortal ' ( Bh. III-7-3). This statement reveals that He is devoid of imperfections.

; 
The scriptural text, Truth, knowledge, etc.' (Tait. 1-2-1-1 ) is not devoid of meaning. Hence Brahman poss- esses the characteristic of knowledge, as He is self-luminous by nature. So also Brahman possesses the two-fold charac- teristics, namely, ' being devoid of evils' and ' being possessed of good qualities'; because the following countless scriptural texts are not devoid of meaning-' He is devoid of evils' (Svet. VI. 19). He, who understands all and knows all (Mund. 1. 10). His supreme power is revealed, indeed, as varied and natural. And so are His knowledge, strength and activity' (Svet. VI. 8).

'He is the Great and Supreme Lord of the lords' (S'vet. VI. 7) etc. The Smrti text is this, – ' He, who knows Me unborn, beginningless etc.' (Bhag. Gi. X. 3).

Or the word 'Darsanat' may be interpreted in different way as recorded in the scriptural text.

The horse by shaking the body gives up some of the solid substances i.e. hairs that are natural to it and constitute part of its body. But the self once did evil works which though perished in a moment, created displeasure to the Lord. The Lord began to give him pains that were effected by His displeasure. But these pains could be got rid of through His grace produced by affection caused by the meditation. Hence non-attachment of evils is what is thought of here. 
Here the following objection arises-The Brahman does not possess the two-fold characteristics; because His having attributes has been denied in the scriptural text, 'Then this is the injunction, namely 'not that, not that ' ( Bh. II. 3-6 ).

By the proof of perception is apprehended the Brahman only, who is merely sat ( existence ). All the rest are illusory. This is the meaning of the statement, of denial 'Not that, not that'. (Byh. II. 3-6 ). To this objection the reply is this- 22. Tadavyaktamaha hi 
That (Brahman) is unmanifested; for, so the scripture declares. 
The essential nature of the Brahman cannot be mani- fested by any of the proofs. The scriptural texts state thus-

Hence (Brahman is characterised) with endless qualities; thus His characteristics hold good. 
In the Brahman are established the endless auspicious qualities taught in the scriptural text, 'There are two-fold forms of the Brahman' (Brh. II-3-1). That being the case the Brahman invariably possesses the two-fold characteristics.

The individual selves are of the nature of adjectives to the Brahman like the light, class, quality and body are to the respective objects.

VII. 25- 2 ). As regards the other two alternatives, it is not possible to set aside the faults, that happen to be in the Brahman, It has been proved in the scriptural texts, that the sentient and the non-sentient beings have the character of adjectives; because they are considered as the body of the Brahman To whom the

PARADHIKARANA 7 
In the Sūtras 1-1-2 to III-2-29, the Supreme Brahman is stated to be the primeval cause of the universe. Now a doubt arises due to some erroneous reasonings that there is some thing higher than this Brahman. This doubt has been introduced in the Sutra- 
30. Paramatah setunmanasambandhabheda-

There is something higher than this, on account of the designations of the bridge, measure, connection and difference.

The scriptures teach that (a) He is the bridge, (b) He is to be crossed, (c) He is measured, (d) He leads men for attainment of the bliss. The scriptures are 'Now the Self is the bridge' (Chand.

Highest except this Self that is mentioned in the words 'not that' (Brh. II-3-6).

Accordingly the following scripture says- Now, the Self is the bridge and support, in order to prevent confusion in these worlds' (Chand. VIII-4-1). The Brahman alone, who is the instrumental cause and the material cause of the world is to be attained as the Highest object. This is stated in the scriptural text beginning with: 'All this world is the Brahman. He is its creator, destroyer and protector. He is thus to be meditated upon with a calm mind' (Chānd. III-14-1 ) and ending with ' I shall reach Him after departing hence' (Chand. III-14-4). The expression 'He has to be crossed' means ' He has to be reached'.

Except Him there is no other Highest Person, because there is the denial of a highest person other than Him in the scriptural text, 'Except whom there is nothing highest and excedpt whom there is nothing smallest or largest ' (Shvet. III-9-7 ) . But there is another text, 'Tato yaduttarataram' (S'vet. III-10-7). The meaning of this text is this — There is none Higest except the Puruşatattva (the Reality of the Supreme Person). Therefore the same Reality that is referred to in the beginning of the context, is described in the concluding portion of the context thus 'He is without form and without evil. Those, who know Him, become Immortal. The others suffer pain' (S'vet. III-10). Thus has been concluded with reason. The proposition that was made in the beginning is this, Having known Him thus, the self reaches something beyond death. There is no other path' (Svet. III-8). Other- wise there will be contradiction to what is stated in the beginning.

What is understood from all Vedanta texts is one, on account of there being no difference in injunc- tions, etc. 
Each of the Upasanas (meditations) Dahara etc., though taught in different texts, is one and the same; because the injunctions, such as 'should know, should meditate', the results, the forms and the names are common. This is similar to the case of the works ordained in Vedic texts.

If it be said that the Vidyas are not one on account of different mentioning; we deny this, since it is even in one. 
The Vidyas are not one; because the same matter repeated in the texts without difference, proves the object of injunction to be different. It is not so. No difference is apprehended in the object of injunctions; because the same Vidya could be repeated in different S'akhas for the benefit of different cognising agents.

In the work called, Samācāra it has been stated thus- 'This has been commented upon by the Vedavrata' (i.e., the vow of the study of Vedas). The word, Brahman, used in the expression Brahmavidya, refers to the Vedas. S'irovrata belongs to them only (Atharvanikas, ) just as the Savahoma. Hence there is nothing to indicate that they are different Vidyās.

If it be said that there is difference in the Vidyas on account of the statements; we say no, on account of non-difference. 
The meditation on the Udgitha viewed as Präṇa, is ordained in the text of the Bṛhadaranyaka and Chandogya Upanisads resulting in the defeat of the enemy. Having re- tained in the heart, the view namely, The Udgithavidyās men - tioned in the two Upanisads are one and the same, the Purva- paksin (the objector) puts forth his view as if held by the Sidhantin. The meditation on the Udgitha viewed as Prāņa in the Bṛhadaranyakopaniṣad has as its object that which is the agent in the act of singing it out. In another text (i.e., Chando- gyopanisad), it has as its object, that which is the object of singing. This has been so understood in the following scriptu- ral texts, 'Then they spoke to Prāņa of the mouth-Please sing that for us. Saying ' So be it' this Prāna sang loudly.' (Brh. 1-3-7). The statement in the Brhadaranyakopanisad shows that the Udgithavidya has as its object that which is the agent

The Udgitha is considered as having as its object, that which is the object of action of singing and it is so stated in the Chandogyopaniṣad thus- 'They meditated upon Udgitha, that is viewed as Prāna of the mouth' (Chānd. 1-2-7). Thus it is stated in the objection that the Vidyas mentioned in the two Upanisads are quite different from each other. The answer is - It is not so ; because they have a common beginning. In one text it is stated thus 'Let us overcome the Asuras at the sacrifices by means of the Udgitha' (Byh. I-3-1 ). In another text also this line occurs-The gods took the Udgitha, thinking they would, with that, overcome the Asuras' (Chand. 1-2-1 ) .

the Udgitha is said to be the object of the meditation in the text - ' Let him meditate on the syllable Om' as Udgitha' (Chand 1-1-1 ). Brhadāranyakopanisad begins with the passage, 'Let us overcome the Asuras at the sacrifice by means of the Udgitha' (Brh. I-3-1). Here the meditation refers to the whole of the Udgitha as the object. Hence these Vidyas are considered to be different from each other due the difference in their forms. As regards the meditation on the Udgitha, in the text of the same S'akha, the Highest Self is viewed as of golden colour and He is also viewed differently as possessing the attributes of being higher than the high. 
8. Samjñatas'cet taduktamasti tu tadapi 
If it be said so on account of the common term; that also is there. 
If the Vidyas mentioned in the two texts are held only one, as they possess the common term of Udgitha, the common term persists, even where the object of injunction differs. Take for instance the term 'Agnihotra', which applies to

because it is the cause for the existence of the sense-organs, such as speech, etc., and for their functions. In the two texts, namely Chandogya and Bṛhadaranyaka it is stated that the quality of being the richest is mentioned as belonging to Prāṇa, though it really pertains to the speech. But this is not stated in Kauşitaki text. However there is no difference between the Prāṇavidyas taught in all the three texts, because the Prāņa is said to possess the quality of being the oldest in all these texts with the same reasonings. Therefore the quality of being the richest also must be included in the Prāṇavidyā mentioned in the Kausitaki text.

Here the qualities, such as, having joy for His head as per the text ' Verily Joy is His head' (Tait.

I, II-6-2) that reveal the Lord's will to become many. It is like in the case of the word Atman (Self) found in the text ‘This world was before, only one ātman' (Self).

If it be said, the word, ātman (Self) is used in connection with other objects also, we say, it is deter- mined that He alone is referred to in other contexts also.

To this objection the answer is this. It has been ascertained from the scriptural text, 'From the Highest Self originates the spatial ether' ( Tait. 1-2-1-2) that Prānamaya refers to the Highest Self. Thus the Highest Self alone is determined to have been meant here.

The Acamana (sipping of water) has been stated thus- Therefore, having known this in this manner, one should sip water before and after the meals. This makes Prāņa not naked'.

This is not so; on account of the difference. 
This is not correct. The Vidyas are different; because there is difference in the places with which the Brahman is said to be connected, the places being the orb of the sun and the right eye. Therefore each name is restricted in regard to each place.

And for the same reason the two virtues namely the holding together the powers and pervading the spatial ether, do not apply to all Vidyas. 
'Gathered together are these greatest powers, in the Brahman. The Greatest Brahman in the beginning pervaded the sky (Tait. Br. II-4-7-10). In the Greatest Brahman are seen together all these powers. The Brahman pervaded the sky. These attributes are not stated with reference to any special meditation. However they cannot be included in all meditations. Therefore the quality of pervading the sky is connected with such meditation in which the place other than small is mentioned. In this text His holding of the powers is mentioned along with the pervasion of the spatial ether. Hence this quality also is applicable only in that 
case.

There is also difference in respect of the fruits. In the Taittiriyaka text the self of the meditator is mentioned as Yajamāna (the agent of the sacrifice). The evenings, mornings and middays are mentioned as the three Savanas (libations). The fruit is the attainment of the greatness of the Brahman. In this

intended for the meditation by the wise. The statement getting rid of them means both the getting rid of them and also their reaching other places. The word, 'getting rid of ' means leaving' and the word, ' reaching ' means 'entry'. It is right to hold that when the leaving alone or the entry alone is mentioned, both of them are intended. It is not right to hold the alternative course of them. The statement of the entry is only supplement to what is stated in the words 'getting rid of '. This is because it declares the places to which the good and evil works, got rid of by the wise, are transferred. Hence it follows that one should be the supplement to the other. In one place this statement occurs- The Kusas relating to the tree'. This is supplemented by another statement occurring in a different place, namely, The Kusās relating to the Udambara tree'. The statement, 'The metres of the gods and Asuras' has the supplementary text, 'The metres of the gods are prior.' The clause,He begins with gold the Stotra of the Sodasin

The statement, 'All the priests join in the singing' has for its supplementary statement, 'The Adhvaryu priest does not sing.' (Tait. Sam. Vi-3-1).

Therefore it is stated thus-One statement will supplement another as the alternative course is not proper' (Pür. Mi. X-8-15).

At death the Punya and Papa Karmans leave the person: because there is nothing to be enjoyed there- after. For, thus certain texts declare. 
That there will be getting rid of the good and bad deeds. at the time of death is stated in the text, 'Shaking off the sins as a horse his hairs, and shaking off the body' (Chānd. Vill-13-1 ). In a different Stākhā, the giving up of the good and the bad deeds on the way has been stated thus, The self

reaches the river Viraja and shakes off his good and bad deeds' (Kaus. I-37). Though it has been stated so differently, it should be meditated upon only at the time of death. After the separation from the body, the self ought not to enjoy pleasure or pain, without attaining the Brahman. Accordingly in another S'akhā it is stated that the self reaches the Brahman immediately after the death. The relevant passage is this- *For him there is delay only so long as he is not freed from the body; then he will reach the Brahman' (Chand. VI. 14-2 ) . 
28. Chandata Ubhayavirodhat 
As it is desired; on account of there being no contradiction of either. 
There are scriptural statements to prove that the good and evil deeds leave the self at the time of death. There are also statements to show that the Brahman ought to be attained immediately after death. There should be no contradiction between these two statements. Therefore the scriptural statement,' He gives up good and evil deeds' (Kauş. I-37) has

Then the following objection is put- 
29. Gaterarthavatvamubhayatha ; anyatha hi virodah 
There is a meaning in the soul's going, only on the two-fold hypothesis; for otherwise there is contradic- tion. 
The scriptural text referring to the journey through the path of gods, will be sensible only when the leaving of the deeds is accepted to take place on two different occasions. Otherwise if it is considered to take place at the time of death, then all his deeds must perish at that time. Then as he has no body, he cannot proceed by any path. Hence there will be contradic- tion regarding the journey, as stated in the scriptural texts.

That assumption is justified; on account of per- ception of the things, that are caused by that. This is as in ordinary experience. 
At the time of the separation from the body, all his deeds become destroyed. Yet it is possible for him to proceed through the path; because those, who meditate. upon the Brahman, can achieve their objects even without deeds, as stated in the scriptural text. 'He becomes a self-ruler, he moves about in all worlds according to his will' (Chänd. VII-25-2). This is just as in the world, those, who serve the kings obtain all their desires, that could not be got by other persons.

There is no restriction, in regard to the path since all have to go on that. Thus there is non-contradiction of scriptural texts and Smrtis. 
In the texts dealing with the meditations such as Upa kosala, it has been stated that those who meditate upon the Brahman as stated therein, proceed along the path of light, etc.

But there is no restriction that those alone who meditate upon the Brahman as stated in those Vidyas attain the Brahman by that path and hence they alone should meditate on that path. But all the meditators engaged in various Vidyas also attain the Brahman, and go by that path. Then only the contradiction between the teachings of the scriptures and the Smṛtis can be averted. The scriptural text mentioned in the Pañcagnividya (i.e., the meditation on the five fires) is this Those, who in the forest meditate on faith and truth, they reach the path of light'. (Brh. VI-2-15). Smṛti text is this—'Fire, light, day, the bright fortnight etc. ' (Bhag. Gi. VIII-24).

The conceptions of the Imperishable, have to be included in all the meditations; on account of the sameness of the object of meditation and of the possibility of the meditation, as in the case of those belonging to the Upasad. This has been thus stated

The scriptural texts begin with, 'This is indeed Imperi. shable' (Bh. III-8-8), 'Then the higher knowledge is that whereby that Imperishable is apprehended' (Mund. I-1-5) and end respectively with, 'It is neither gross nor minute, neither short nor long, it is not red' (Bh. III-8-8), ' That which is not visible and not knowable' (Mund. I-1-6). Here in the Paravidyas (the higher meditations) all the attributes of the Imperishable Brahman ( such as ), neither gross nor visible etc. have to be included; because the Brahman, the possessor of these attributes, is apprehended to be a single object. And because without these attributes, it is not possible to meditate upon Him, as distinct from all other objects. The characteris- tics that distinguish the Brahman from the individual souls, are the bliss etc. that do not tolerate the connection with evils. In- deed it is natural that the Gunas (subordinates) are in harmony with the Pradhāna ( principal ).

That following this argument, it could not be objected that all the attributes stated in different Vidyas, have to be included in all the Vidyas, is proved in the following Sutra- 
34. Iyadamananat 
Only so much qualities have to be included for the sake of meditation. 
The word ' Amanana ' means 'the consecrated meditation.' Only so much of the qualities have to be included in all meditations, as are useful in distinguishing the Brahman from other objects.

The question put by Uşasta about the self (in Brh. III- 4-1) refers to the individual self to whom the aggregate form of material things belongs. Otherwise the object mentioned in the reply 'The self is he, who breathes through the vital wind (i.e., Prāṇa)' could not be differentiated from the one, mentioned in the reply given to the question of Kahola, as freed from hunger thirst etc. It is not so. In both the places the questions are in only one form, namely, 'The Self, who is the inner self of all' (Brh.III-4-1). Hence in both the places the Highest Self is referred to. Causing the breath and the absence of thirst and hunger mentioned in the reply could be justified only in the Highest self. That the Highest self is the cause of breathing, has been mentioned in the text,' who could breathe and live if there were not this blissful Ākāsa (Brahman)?' (Tait. I-2-7). As in the case of the Sadvidya, the repeated questions and answers refer to the same object (Brahman).

He approaches his relatives as and when he likes as stated in the text, 'He moves about there eating, playing and enjoying' (Chand. VIII-12-2). This is the fruit of his attainment of the final release. It is not the fruit connected with Samsara. Therefore the Vidya covering His qualities is also the Paravidya.

There is no necessity of undertaking of the medita- tion on the Udgitha; because it is so seen in the scriptures. The non-obstruction is the separate fruit for it. 
It is not necessary that the meditation on the Udgitha should be adopted in the sacrifices, as in the case of the Godohana (milk-pail), because even those, who do not meditate on the Udgitha are seen to perform the sacri- fices. The scriptural text in support of this view is this. 'Therefore those who meditate on this and those who do not meditate on this both perform the sacrifices' (Chānd. I-1-10). The present tense is used in the text, 'That which is performed with the knowledge, will have powerful effect ( Chand. I-1-10).

Just as in the case of the offerings. This has been. explained. 
In the Daharavidyā, there is the mention of the medita- tion on the Brahman, as possessed of attributes, such as 'being devoid of evil, etc.' There will be the repetition of the medita- tions on the Brahman when He is viewed to possess various qualities one after another; because in each case He is con- sidered to be varied on account of the connection with each of the qualities. This case is analogous to that of the sacrifical offerings. There is the text, 'He is to offer a Puroḍāsa to Indra the ruler, etc.' (Tait. Sam. II-3-6). The essential nature of Indra changes, as his attributes are mentioned one

The word, Nārāyana, occurs in the text, ' The thousand- headed God etc.' (Tait. II-11-1). This is not a specification. of the object of the meditation of the Daharavidyā alone mentioned therein. It has to be taken as a specification of the objects of all the Vidyas mentioned in different texts; because there are many statements containing particular significances in favour of this decision. Indeed, these state- ments while referring the objects of the meditations with the words Akṣara, S'ambhu, S'iva, Supreme Brahman etc. specify that these objects are nothing but Nārāyaṇa.

In the text, 'Built of mind, built of speech, built of Prāņa' (Agnirahasya of Vājasaneyins), are mentioned the metaphorical representations of the fire. These have to be connected with the sacrifices, which are of the nature

And on account of the transfer. 
The text' Of these each one is as great as the previous one (Madh. S'. Br. 10-4-1-3) transfers the power of the fire seated in the altar of bricks, to the fire of mind. Therefore the fire of mind, etc. become auxiliaries to the sacrificial performances.

These fires of the mind etc. belong to the class of meditation only. The meaning is that these fires are auxili- aries to the sacrifices of meditation. They are determined to be of meditation, as there is in them the metaphorical representation of fires as stated in the text 'Indeed, they are verily made of thought' (Madh. S'. Br. 10-4-1-12). They have been determined in that way in order to reveal that they belong to the class of meditation, as they are connected with the sacrifice of meditation.

The statement of the things connected with the sacrifice is seen in the text, ' By the mind the sacrificial cups have been taken' (Madh. S'. Br. 10-4-1-3). There are also scriptural texts to show that there are sacrifices of meditation- 'By thought alone are they made' (Madh. S'. B. 10-4- 1-12 ).

different from the sacrifice of action as in the case of medita- tions Daharavidyä etc. It is seen that the injunctions are meant in the texts that are Anuvada-'He, who does it through the knowledge' (Chānd I-1-10). This has been stated in Piūr. Mim. Si. III-5-21.

The text' Each of these fires has the same effect as seen in that' (Madh. S'. Br. 10-4-1-3) says that whatever fruit is obtained by the means of the fire of the brick-made altar, the same can be obtained by the means of them. It means whatever fruit the fire of brick-made altar can give through the sacrificial action, the same fruit can be got by the means of each of these fires through the sacrifice of the meditation. It does not mean that each of them occupies the

And by the subsequent text is proved that the word is used in such a meaning. But on account of plurality of the auxiliaries it is found in that context. 
The subsequent Brāhmaṇa text also proves that the passages relating to the fire of mind, etc., refer to the sacrifice of the meditation only. The text reads thus, 'This fire is this world and the water around it is the sea (Mädh. S'. Br. 10-4-2-1). From this, it appears that what is enjoined here is the meditation with a special result of its own. In the Agnirahasya, under the section of ' sacrificial rites', is included the portion dealing with the fires of mind, etc., as many auxiliaries have to be applied to them from that context,

Some state that He has to be meditated upon as the Self of the meditator in his meditating stage, on account of the existence of the meditating soul within the body. 
When meditating, the self remains within the body and has the character of being the doer and the enjoyer. Therefore some think that in all the meditations upon the Highest, the Highest Self has to be meditated upon as being the self of those embodied souls.

Brahman as stated in the text, 'He, who meditates upon Him, Immeasurable, the leader of all men (Vaisvānara ), as con - nected with these places, eats ( enjoys) the food (namely the Brahman) in all the worlds, etc.' (Chand. V-18-1). Here is mentioned the meditation on Him with the aggregate form with the limbs, such as head etc. Suppose there is the meditation on Him with each of the limbs separately. Then there will be only the limited enjoyment. Therefore in order to have unlimited enjoyment, He should be meditated up on in the aggregate form, because this course only is reasonable and the enjoyment on the Brahman has been declared in that case only. But the statement of the fruit on the meditation on the limbs separately, is as in the case of the performance of the sacrifices as stated in the text- When a son is born, one should offer on twelve potsherds to Vaisvanara ', and again a separate fruit is stated thus 'There is an offering on eight potsherds,' (Tait. Sam. II-2-5). The scriptural text points out the greatness of the meditation on the aggregate form of the Brahman. The meditation on the limbs has been mentioned in the text, 'Oh! King! the possessor of the auspicious qualities ( the Bhagavan), I meditate upon Him as heavens' (Chānd.

The meditations are different; because they are called by different names etc. 
In Sadvidya, Bhumavidya, etc., the Brahman alone is to be meditated upon and the fruit thereof is His attainment alone. But these Vidyas are different from each other; because the modes of the chief object (Brahman) of meditations are distinct from each other. That the modes are different has been determined by their denotation by different words etc. This topic was once dealt with in the Purvakāṇḍa of the Mimämsä with reference to the sacrifices, yet it is dealt with again here to dispel the mistaken idea of certain groups of philosophers namely, that the Vedanta texts do not enjoin the knowledge (meditation).

The illustrious Badarāyaṇa thinks that the cardinal benefit of life results from knowledge. The scriptural authorities are these: 'The knower of the Brahman reaches the Highest' (Tait. 1-2-1). He, who knows Him set down. in the secret abode, enjoys in the highest heaven, all desires as well as the Brahman' (Tait. I-2-1 ) .

2. S'eşatvat puruṣārthavado yathanyeṣviti Jaiminiḥ 
On account of its being subordinate, the state- ment of the benefit in its case is only Arthavada as in other cases ; so Jaimini thinks. 
In the text, 'That thou art ' (Chānd. VI- 8-7) the agent of the action is apprehended to be Brahman, on account of the grammatical equation (Sāmānādhikarṇya). The knowledge. on him is subservient to the works performed, so far as it produces certain consecration in the agent. The texts, that mention the fruits of the knowledge are only Arthavādās, ( exaggeration) as in the case of the sacrificial things, etc. 
3. Acaradarsanat 
On account of such Acara (practice) being seen. 
Asvapati Kekaya, the knower of the Brahman, said, ' Verily, O illustrious ones, I am about to perform a sacrifice ' (Chand. V-11-5). Hence it is seen in this and other scriptural texts that the conduct of those, who know the Brahman, is

4. Tacchrutek 
It is so, on account of that being stated in the scriptures. 
The knowledge is an auxiliary part of the works as it has to be utilised for the performance of works. This is stated in the text, ' whatever one does, with knowledge' (Chānd. 1-1-10). The meaning of this text is this - Whatever one does, he does with knowledge. Or it means -— That work, which one does with knowledge, is more powerful. 
5. Samanvarambhanat 
On account of taking hold together. 
The knowledge is an auxiliary part of works; because both are seen to go together in one person, as stated in the text, Then both knowledge and work take hold of him' (Byh. VI-4-4).

The view of the Badarāyaṇa, is this-Knowledge is not an auxiliary part of works, 'But the cardinal benefit of life is the result produced by knowledge.' Because the teaching is that the knowledge of One, who is other than the individual self, is to be obtained. How could this be? Because in the following scriptural text, the Highest One is mentioned to be known - ' May I become many ' (Chānd. VI-2-3. ). He is the cause, He is the Lord of the lords of the senses (i. e., the individual selves), (S've. I. 19).

Of him, who has made merely the verbal study of the Veda.

It is already stated that the study of the Veda means injunction on the to refer to the mere textual recitation. Or granting that the study of the Vedas includes knowing the meaning also, the knowledge, that is different from knowing the meaning of the Vedas, is stated to be one of the meditations to be repeated again and again.

The text, that mentions the meditation on the Udgitha, as the best of the essences, cannot mean an injunction. This is similar to the text, The ladle (Juhi ) is the earth, the Ahavaniya is the heavenly world'. Udgitha has been men- tioned as a constituent element of works. Then to state that as the best of essences is mere glorification on the Udgitha and is not an injunction, as in the case of the text, 'The ladle, etc.' It is not so, because there is no injunc tion of the Udgitha in the context as in the case of the ladle. Hence the meditation as the best of essences is to be taken an injunction as it is not establishad by any other proof.

These works are the same in their essential nature. Yet they are performed with different views. Hence no contradiction arises. 
35. Anabhibhavam ca darsayati 
And scriptures declare knowledge not be over- powered by works. 
All evil works, that stand in the way of the rise of know- ledge, are removed. This is stated in the text, ' By works of sacred duty, he drives away evil deeds' (Tait II-50). Thus the text shows that the works have to be performed so that the knowledge is not over-powered, by evil deeds.

In the Sūtras II-1-22 & III-4-8 is explained that the Brahman, is other than the individual Self. Even then the person, engaged in the meditation should meditate upon Him as, 'I am the Brahman'. Because the wise of olden times ack- nowledged thus-' Then I am, indeed, thou, holy divinity and thou art me'. Thus the devotees acknowledged Him as their Self.

In the usage, 'I am the man' the word 'man' which naturally indicates the human body refers to the self and the thought arrived at from the word finally takes the self as the object, because the body is always an adjunct to the self.

Only those good and evil deeds performed before the acquisition of knowledge perish, the effects of which have not begun to operate; because of the texts-' For him there is delay only as long as he is not delivered from the body' (Chand. VI- 14-2 ) say that they last till death.

Consider the texts His sons get a share of properties'. 'His evil deeds cling to his enemy. His good-deeds attach themselves to his friends'. Some good works, other than the Agnihotra etc. are performed from time immemorial. They are obstructed from granting fruits by other works of greater strength. The strong works obstruct also the grant of fruits, such as rain, food, life and health etc., of the subsequent works. Hence the scriptural texts mentioned above refer to these both kinds of deeds.

Speech reaches the mind, on account of this being seen and of scriptural statement. 
The scriptural statement is this : 'O dear, when a man departs from hence, his speech is combined with mind' (Chānd. VI-8-6 ). Suppose a person departs from this world. In his case the organ of speech stops working even before his mind ceases to function. Hence it is right to say that speech reaches the with mind.

It is common before the beginning of the way; and the immortality (is that which is obtained) without having burned. 
● 
Both the knower and the other follow the common route till the path begins with light, etc. because the scripture says that the knower reaches the Brahman by traversing the path of light etc. When all desires, which once dwelt in his heart are undone, then the mortal becomes immortal, then he obtains the Brahman' (Kath. II-3-14). Here the statements, such as the immortality and the attainment of the Brahman refer to the starting of meditation without breaking the connection, that the self bears to the body and the sense organs.

A subtle body persists even after his departure from the gross body; otherwise he cannot traverse by the path. A subtle body is accepted not only by this reason but also because the other proofs, are observed in the scriptures such as the conversation with the moon etc. that establish the ex- istence of a subtle body after departure.

" 
He, who has no desire, his Prāņas do not pass forth ' (Brh. IV-4-6). That means the Pranas do not leave the wise. Hence the wise attain the Brahman here alone. This is not so. The wise, that leave the gross body, pass through the path of light, etc. and for that purpose the Prāņas do not leave him. Hence it is stated thus 'His Pranas do not pass forth' (Brh, IV -4-6). This fact has been clearly stated in the version of the Madyandinas thus: But of him, who has no desire, who is free from desire, whose desire is satisfied, whose desire is the self only, the Präņas do not pass forth.' ( Bh. IV -4-6).

meditation on other than those said above. Badarāyaṇa thinks, that the light etc., lead them who know the five-fold fires and meditate upon the Highest Self following the latter class of the meditations said above. The contradiction with the statements made in all the Upanishadic passages arise, when the object of meditation is taken to be the effected Brahman or the Highest Self alone. If the object of meditation is taken to be the effected Brahman then the scriptural texts, 'They lead to the Brahman'. (Chand. IV-15-6). and 'Having reached the Highest Light' (Chand. VIII-3-4) will oppose this view. If the Highest Self alone is held to be the object of meditation, then the text, 'Those, who know this (i.e., as stated in the Pañcagnividya) and those too who in the forest medi- tate with faith upon the Truth, go to light ' (Byh. VI-2-15 ) will oppose the view. If the object of meditation is held to be the effected Brahman then the law of Tatkratu will also be contra- dicted. It is stated in the scriptures that those, who traverse through the path of light, etc., reach the Brahman and do not come back. The knowers of the five fires meditate on the self bereft of the Prakṛti, and having for his Self the Brahman as stated in the text, 'He, who remains in the self' (Brh. III-7-22

And scripture declares the difference. 
The meditation on the effected Brahman grants fruits in limited places and limited times, that are different from the attainment of the Brahman. This is stated in the text, 'He, who meditates upon name as Brahman, for him there is movement as he wishes as far as name extends' (Chand. VII-1-5).

On the self, on reaching the Highest Self, there is manifestation; as we infer from the word, 'own'. 
'Thus that serene self, having risen from the body and having reached the Highest Light, becomes manifest in his own form' (Chând. VIII-12-2). This scriptural text states that the self has been already in possession of his essential nature and it has been concealed by the beginningless Karman. When he reaches the Highest Light, it manifests itself; because thus has been stated in the scriptural text by the specific words, 'With his own form'.

The essential nature of the self has been already in him. But this nature including 'unlimited knowledge ' etc., manifests itself only in Mukti because he is freed from bondage of Karman at that stage. The promise made in the text. 'I will explain further to you' (Chand. VIII-9-3) is to explain that, whose concealment in the waking state etc. has been removed. 
3. Atma prakaraņat 
The self; on account of the subject matter." 
It is understood from the context that the scriptural text 'I will explain this further to you' (Chānd VIII-9-3) refers to the self as endowed with good qualities such as freedom from evil. The text mentioned above begins to describe thus

By meditating upon Him in the way mentioned. in the Brahma-Sutras IV-1-3 His essential nature is to be ex- perienced only in that form. The object of meditation is only what is established by the scriptures-' He who dwells within the self, of whom the self is the body' 'That thou art ' (Chand. VI-8-7) etc.

Jaimini thinks that a nature like that of the Brahman, manifests itself on the self; on account of the declaration etc. 
A nature like that of the Brahman, consisting of the qualities such as 'Freedom from evils' manifests itself in the individual self. These are the qualities of the Brahman; Yet they belong to the individual self also. This has been under- stood from the declaration found in the text, 'The self is free from evils etc.' (Chand. VIII-7-1). Same thing has been stated in the text, ' He is eating, playing, rejoicing' (Chand. VIII-12-3). This is the view of Jaimini.

Even it is thus; on account of the declaration of the existence of former qualities, Badarayana holds absence of contradiction. 
It has been understood that the mass of knowledge is the nature of the individual self. Yet the former qualities, such as ' Freedom from evils' etc. are apprehended in him. This is stated in the text, ' The self is free from evils.' (Chānd VIII - 7- 1). The two groups of natures apprehended in the two texts are not contradictory each other. Therefore of these two forms one does not exclude the other. Therefore the illustrious Bāda. rāyaṇa thinks there is a collection of both the natures in the self.

There are texts to show that, as and when he desires, he can have body or not. The analogous case is the twelve-days' sacrifice, which according to the texts, belongs either to the Sattra or the Ahina class of sacrifices.

'True will'. He does not possess the character of being the cause in the creation etc., of the world. From the context, it is apprehended that the Highest Brahman alone possesses the power of the creation etc., of the world. The text begins with From Him are born all these beings' and concludes ' That is the Brahman' (Tait. I-2-1 ). Moreover in texts dealing with creation, etc., the Released self does not find a place. The Released self possesses greatness, that has not been concealed by anything. He experiences the Brah- man in His complete nature, possessed of unsurpassed bliss. The creation etc., conducted by the Brahman are only the sport for Him. This has been stated in the Brahma- sutra II-1-33.

If it be said that this is not so; on account of the scriptual text; not so, because it refers to the state of him who resides within the spheres of those entrusted with special duties.

This is the teaching of the text: 'He moves through these worlds, eating what he desires, and assuming any shape. what he desires' (Tait. 1-10-5). Hence the Released self creates the worlds. It is not so; because they are the pleasures of those who are in the region of Hiranyagarbha etc., who are entrusted with special duties. Indeed the text does not say that he controls those worlds. 
19. Vikaravarti ca tathahi sthitimaha 
The Released self experiences the Unchangeable one; the scriptures state his condition thus. 
His pleasure consists of only the enjoyment of the Brahman in His real and entire nature, that does not undergo any changes. His condition has been stated in the text thus: 'Bliss indeed is He; having obtained that Bliss, he becomes blissful' (Tait. I-7-1).

This fact has been stated in the texts of S'ruti and Smṛti 'From this Self mentioned above, verily, the spatial ether came into existence' (Tait. 1-2-2 ). Oh! Gärgi ! verily, under the ruling of this Imperishable One' (Bh. 1II-8-9). There is also the Smrti. 'I am the source of all; everything proceeds from Me' (Bhag. Gi. X-8). 
21. Bhogamātrasamyalingacca 
And on account of the indication, namely, 'equality in enjoyment only '. 
'He enjoys all desires and the omniscient Brahman' (Tait. I-2-2). This scriptural text says that the Released self is equal to the Highest Self, only in so far as enjoyment of the true nature of the Brahman. 
22. Anavrttih sabdat anavrtih sabdat 
No returning; according to the scriptures. No returning; according to the scriptures. 
Consider the scriptural text 'He, who lives thus all theचतुर्थाध्याये चतुर्थ पादः

life through, reaches the world of the Brahman and he does not return' (Chand. VIII-15-1). The Released self becomes free from all, that has concealed his true nature. 
The host of qualities such as, 'Freedom from sin' manifests themselves in him. He experiences the Highest Brahman, who is unsurpassable Bliss. He does not return again to this world. This has been so determined. Thus the entire truth of the 
doctrine is perfect and faultless. 
THUS ENDS THE 4TH PADA OF THE 4TH ADHYĀYA.
