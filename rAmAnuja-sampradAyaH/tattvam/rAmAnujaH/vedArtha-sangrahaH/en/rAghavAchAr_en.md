3. The following defence may be put forward by the purva-paksin: In the section under  consideration, in the commencement itself, the sole reality of the cause is propounded  through the declaration of that one knowledge from which all knowledge is said to follow.  It is further shown that the cause alone is real and that all its modifications are  unreal, through the illustrations of clay and its products. It is then asserted of that Brahman,  the real, that it is undifferentiated, as it is without any other entity either generically the  same or different. The idea is embodied in the statement, ‘Being alone was this in the  beginning, one only, without a second (Chan. 6:2:1)’. Passages, found in other parts of  the scripture, which determine the exact nature of Brahman affirm that ‘Brahman is real,  knowledge and infinite (Tai. 2:1)’ and that it is ‘without parts’, ‘actionless’, ‘flawless’,  ‘attributeless’, ‘consciousness’, ‘bliss’, etc., and thus teach that the sole nature of Brahman  is to be contrary to all differentiating determinations. The terms signifying the unitary  essence are not tautologous on that account. Even though the entity is absolutely one, the  several terms serve to demarcate it as opposed to all pluralizing characterizations. Thus all  terms have significance. 
4. We reply that this interpretation is inadmissible. The knowledge of the one cannot lead  to the knowledge of all, on this interpretation, as all the entities to be known, being unreal,  simply do not exist or the identity of the real and the unreal will follow by implication. On  the contrary, if all the entities are real only by virtue of being included in the one (or being  embodiments of the one) the knowledge of the ‘one’ will lead to the knowledge of all. 
To discuss the whole section — the question that Uddalaka puts to Shvetaketu is this: ‘You  are arrogant. Did you inquire into that law? (Chan. 6:1:3)’. The question means, ‘You  dissemble perfection. Did you seek to learn from those teachers concerning that law also?’  The term ‘law’ signifies here him by whom the law is ordained. Law literally 
12 
means ‘command’. In that case the conception here would cohere with the passage,  ‘Owing to the command of the Imperishable, the sun and the moon stand apart sustained  (Brh. Ar. 5:8:9)’. So runs the words of Manu (12: 122) also when be says, ‘The one who  commands all’ etc. Even this section itself propounds first the idea that Brahman is the  material cause of the universe by the phrase ‘one only’ and then excludes another efficient  cause by the expression ‘without a second’. Therefore the whole question may be  interpreted thus: Have you enquired into that principle which is the commanding spirit as  well as the material cause of the world, by hearing of which, by thinking of which and by  understanding which, everything that was not heard of before, not thought of before and  not understood before, comes to be heard of, thought of and understood ? 
1. The inner idea is this: Have you learnt about Brahman which is the primeval cause of the  processes like creation, maintenance and destruction of the entire universe and which is the  ocean of limitless perfections like omniscience and realized desires and will that gets  realized ? The father keeping in his mind the thought that cause itself assuming manifold  configurations comes to be known as the effect and that Brahman being the sole cause of  all, the knowledge of Brahman in its causal aspect possessing as its body the sentient and  non-sentient entities in their subtle unmanifest condition, includes the knowledge of the  universe in the state of the effect, asks the son about that ‘Whereby the unheard of  becomes heard of, the unthought of becomes thought of, and the misunderstood becomes  understood? (Chan. 6:1:3)’. The son not intuiting the idea at the back of his father’s  mind that all that exists proceeds from a single cause thinks that among different  existences, the knowledge of one existence cannot lead to the knowledge of another  existence. Hence he inquires, ‘How can there be such a law, Sir? (Chan.  6:1:3)’. Questioned thus the father proceeds to demonstrate the preliminary principle of the  identity of cause and effect, a matter of common experience. While he does so his  purpose is to expound ultimately his inner idea, operative in his discourse from the very  beginning. That idea may be set forth as follows: The highest Brahman is purity, bliss and  knowledge in substance. Its grandeur is inconceivable. It is resplendent with countless  auspicious attributes, like the will that irresistibly realizes itself, in surpassing perfection. It  is immutable in nature. Still, out of its causal state, in which the sentient and non-sentient  beings from its body in their Subtle condition, undifferentiated in name and form,  it, through its own will, passes In sheer sport into the state of the effect, by one of its  aspects, and comes to possess the limitless and diversified world of moving and non moving beings as its own configuration. With this idea in his mind be proceeds  to propound how knowledge of Brahman leads to knowledge of ,ill. As a preliminary step  in exposition, he demonstrates the identity of cause and effect, a principle quite obvious  to common experience. For that purpose he has taken this instance, ‘Even as, by knowing  the lump of clay, all that is made of clay is known and “by speech, the modification and  name are brought about and only as clay is it real” (Chan. 6:1:.4.)’. The meaning is this:  The same substance, clay, in a part of itself, becomes modified into a multitude of forms  and conditions and acquires a multitude of names for serving different practical purposes.  Even then these different products, being nothing other than particular forms of clay, the  original substance, clay itself exists in these several conditions. The products are not  entities other than clay. Then it is pointed out that by knowing the lump of clay, all  its varied configurations like pots and pans are known. Then the son, not knowing that  Brahman alone is the cause of the entire cosmos, asks, ‘May your blessed self, instruct me  about that matter (Chan. 6:1:7)’. Then the father instructing that the omniscient and  omnipotent Brahman is the cause of all, lays down, ‘Being alone, this was in the  beginning, one only, without a second (Chan.. 6:2:1)’.
13 
1.  In this proposition the term ‘this’ signifies the world. The expression ‘in the beginning’  signifies the time prior to creation. At that time the world was one with Being. But the  world is one with being even after creation. Therefore it is pointed out that the world was  one with Being then in the sense that it was without distinctions of names and forms. ‘This  is signified by the expression ‘one only’. The fact that Being is the material cause of the  world is thereby enunciated. Then the possibility of another entity being the  intelligent operative cause is repudiated by the term ‘advitiya’ meaning ‘one without a  second’. By these elaborations is the idea now revealed, which was in the heart of the  teacher from the beginning as cryptically indicated in the opening statement, ‘Did you  learn that law, by which, that which is not heard of, becomes heard of’ etc..— the idea of  the great law-giver being the material cause of’ the world. This idea is further explained.  The Being itself, the material and efficient cause of the world, thought, ‘Let me be many,  let me multiply (Chan. 6:2:3)’. The entity described as Being is the highest Brahman, all knowing, all-powerful and has its will realizing itself unfailingly. Though all its des ‘res  are eternally realized, it willed, for purposes of sport, ‘Let me be many’, assuming the form  of the world, consisting of the wondrously varied and limitless entities both sentient and  non-sentient. For that purpose It thought, ‘Let me multiply’; out of a part of itself  it acquired the elements like ether. Then that highest Deity named Being deliberated thus,  ‘I will enter these three deities as atman, the jiva and differentiate names and forms (Chan.  6:3: 2)’. Here the expressions ‘atman, the jiva’ bring out the idea that the jiva or individual  self has Brahman as its soul. Thus it is brought out explicitly that all that is non-sentient  attains the status of an entity because of the entry into it of the individual Self having  Brahman as its inner atman and that only as such do the non-sentient entities acquire  names and forms. 
2.  The matter stands this way: —The individual self constitutes a mode of Brahman being  its body. Hence it is ensouled by Brahman. The fact that the individual is the body of  Brahman is set forth in another passage of the Veda, ‘Whose body the atman is (Su. 6)’.  The physical forms like the heavenly and human bodies, are the modes of individual souls  being bodies. Therefore all these forms have Brahman as their ultimate self. Therefore all  terms like gods, men, yaksa, demon, beast, bird, tree, creeper, wood, stone, grass, jar and  cloth, which have denotative power, formed of roots and suffixes, signify the objects which  they name in ordinary parlance and through them they signify the individual  selves embodied in them and through this second signification, their significance develops  further till it culminates in Brahman, the highest Self dwelling as the inner controller of all  individual selves. Thus all terms are denotative of this totality. 
3.  Thus, the section of the Upanishad under consideration develops in details the thought  that the entire universe of sentient and non-sentient entities has Being as its material cause,  its efficient cause, its ground, its controller and its Lord to which it is instrumental in value.  This is done in the passage commencing with the text, ‘All these creatures have Being as  their source, abide in Being and are based on Being (Chan. 6:8: 4-6)’. Secondly it proceeds  through the principle of causality to the thought that the only truth about the universe is  that it is animated by Brahman: ‘All this is ensouled by this (Being). That is the truth  (Chan. 6:8: 6)’. He is the self of the whole world and the whole world constitutes his body.  Hence the section proceeds to the thought that the entity signified by the term ‘thou’ is  Brahman itself having the individual self as its mode. The universal principle enunciated  that all entities are ensouled by Brahman is applied to a particular self (Shvetaketu) and the  particular conclusion is drawn there from. 
4.  The crux of the matter is this: ‘All this is ensouled by this’. By the term, ‘All this’ the  world of finite spirits and matter is signified and the fact of the world being ensouled by 
14 
this atman is affirmed. The character of having Brahman as the inner soul is predicated of  the subject, namely, the world. Now this fact of Brahman being the soul of the world must  be exactly elucidated. There are two alternatives: Does it mean that Brahman is the self of  the world in terms of the relation of soul and body? Or is the world, identical in substance  with Brahman? If the alternative that the world is identical with Brahman in substance  is admitted, the attributes of Brahman, like the will that realizes itself unfailingly, asserted  in the opening section itself, ‘It thought, “Let me be many” (Chan. 6:2: 3)’ get  nullified. The second alternative of immanence as soul in the body, is specially made out in  other passages of the scripture, ‘He has entered into all creatures, he is the ruler of all  creatures and he is the self of all (Tait. Ar.. 3:24)’. It means: He has entered into all  creatures as their soul, being their ruler; therefore he is the self of all creatures and all  creatures constitute his body. Thus Brahman being the self of all is definitely explained.  There is another passage also to the same effect: ‘He who dwells in the atman, who is in  the atman, whom ;atman does not know, whose body the atman is, who rules the atman,  know him, as your atman, the inner ruler, immortal (Brh. Ar. Ma. 5:7:22)’. Even in this  very section, ‘The atman, the jiva (Chan. 6:3:2)’ the same idea is elucidated as set forth  before. Therefore all the sentient beings and non-sentient objects being the body of  Brahman, Brahman having all entities as its body, as its modes, is itself the  subject denoted by all terms. Hence in the proposition embodying co-ordinate predication  asserting identity between ‘That’ and ‘Thou’, Brahman itself, with the jiva as its mode,  having the ‘jiva as its body, is spoken of. 
1.  The meaning implied in such a manner of speaking is this: He the individual self, who  was cognised previously as the controlling principle in the body, is just constitutive of the body of the highest Self and so is his mode. His existence reaches up to the  highest Self. Therefore the term ‘Thou’ denotes the inner ruler qualified by the individual  self as his mode. The Vedanta text, ‘As this atman, the jiva, entering, I will differentiate  names and forms (Chan. 6:3:2)’, makes it clear that the individual self embodied as he is,  can have his individual name only by virtue of Brahman being his indwelling soul. Hence  both the terms ‘That’ and ‘Thou’ signify only Brahman. The term ‘That’ refers to  Brahman, the cause of the world, the abode of all (perfections, the faultless and the  immutable. The term ‘Thou’ refers to the same Brahman, the inner ruler in all  individual selves, qualified by the jiva along with its body as its mode. Thus the two have  different connotations and denote the same Brahman. The perfection, immutability,  possession of all auspicious attributes and the causality in relation to the world are not  denied of Brahman. 
2.  Men, unacquainted with Vedanta, do not see that all things and all individual selves  have Brahman as their self. They think that all terms exhaust their significance  by signifying the various objects by themselves, which objects are in reality a part and not  the whole of the meaning of terms. Now by the study of Vedanta, they understand that all  such objects are the effects of Brahman, that Brahman is the inner ruler of them all and that  they are animated by Brahman as their very soul. Therefore they come to under- stand that  all terms signify Brahman itself having as its modes the entities, to which latter alone the  terms are applied in common usage. 
3.  ‘In that case’, it may be objected, ‘the significance of term like cow in relation to what  they normally denote in standard usage will stand negated’. Our reply is that no such  results follow. All terms are denotative of the highest Self, which is qualified by inanimate  nature and individual selves. This is what is urged in the text, ‘I will differentiate names  and forms (Chan. 6:3:2)’. In this matter ordinary people, while putting language to use,  imagine that the denotation of terms is exhausted by their reference to the various 
15 
empirical objects they signify. But this is just a part of the range of the denotation that  really belongs to terms. This restriction of the denotative significance is due to the fact that  the principal part of the objective meaning of the term, namely the highest Self, transcends  ordinary modes of cognition like perception. The study of Vedanta completes the  understanding of the significance of terms (and does not cancel that significance as 
alleged). 
1.  Thus all Vedic terms denote their respective referents in such a way that the denotation  stretches up to the highest Self. The highest Brahman brought forth the various beings of  the world as before and took out the terms of the Vedas and applied them as before as  names to those beings, which have their being in Brahman. Manu says, ‘In the  beginning He created the names of all actions and the different configurations even  according to the words of the Veda (1:21)’. Configuration (samsthana) means form.  Bhagavan Parashara says, ‘In the beginning he set forth names, forms and duties of  beings like the gods through the words of the Vedas themselves (Vi. Pu. 1, V, 63)’. The  Vedas also declare, ‘The Creator fashioned the sun and the moon as before’. It means that  he fashioned entities like the sun is before and determined their names as before. 
2.  Thus the identity between the world and Brahman is explained. On this ground that all  is known when the ‘one’ is known is accounted for. Since all entities are real only as the  effects of Brahman and as ensouled by Brahman, it has been said, ‘That is true’. In no  other ways are they real. Just as, in the illustration of clay and its products, the products are  real only as of the nature of clay, even so the world is real only as sustained by the  indwelling Brahman. 
3.  The propositions determinative of the nature of Brahman, determine it as being devoid  of imperfections and as full of auspicious attributes. Even if they are interpreted as  determining Brahman through the negation of all else, that very negation must be based on  positive grounds in the nature of Brahman. As these positive grounds of negation 
characterize Brahman, it is impossible to uphold that Brahman is without differentiating  characteristics. 
1.  ‘But’, it maybe said, ‘as it is laid down that Brahman is pure knowledge, we must  admit that it is undifferentiated knowledge’. We reply that such a conclusion does not  follow. Terms signifying attributes definitive of the substantiative nature of an entity  denote the substantive nature also through the connotation of such definitive attributes.  This is so in the analogous cases of terms like ‘cow’. The author of the Sutras (2:3:29-30)  holds, ‘As it is the essential attribute, the substance itself is designated thus, as in the case  of the omniscient one’, and ‘There is no flaw in this procedure, as the attribute is co 
terminus with the substance’. Through the attribute of knowledge, the substantive nature is  also determined and mere knowledge is not Brahman. ‘How is this construed? It may be  asked. It is so construed because there is the passage, ‘He who is all-knower and all cognisor (Mun. 2:2:7)’ making out that Brahman is a knower. There are hundreds of  passages holding this position like the following: — “Transcendent and manifold power of  his is sung in the scripture and also his inherent knowledge, strength and activity (Sve.  4:4:17)’ and ‘By what means can you know the knower? (Brh. Ar. 4:4:14)’. Further,  knowledge is only an attribute and an attribute merely by itself cannot constitute an entity.  Therefore, the terms like, ‘Real, Knowledge’ denote Brahman as characterized by the  attributes they connote.16 
1.  In the case of the terms ‘That and ‘Thou” to hold that both terms signify the  undifferentiated substratum through the elimination of the distinctive connotations of  ‘That’ and ‘Thou’ is to reject their principal significance. 
2.  (Objection): Since unity of import is assured, there is no error in resorting to secondary  meaning. Such is the case in the proposition, ‘This is he, that Devadatta’. Here by the word  ‘He’ a person associated with a different time and place is meant. By the word ‘This’ a  person associated with the present time and the immediate vicinity of the speaker is meant.  The identity of the two persons is conveyed by the proposition of co-ordinate predication.  Since the same person cannot be conceived simultaneously as being present in  two contradictory points of space and time, both the terms signify only the substantive  personality of the man and the sameness of the person is brought out. 
3.  (Reply): This account of the situation is wrong. There is not even the slightest recourse  to secondary meaning in the case of the proposition, ‘This is he, that Devadatta’. This is  due to the fact that there is no contradiction in the primary meaning. The same individual  can, without any contradiction, be associated with actions in the past and the present.  Presence at a different place is an event of the past. Presence in the immediate vicinity is  an event of the present. Therefore there is no contradiction involved in positing the identity  of the individual associated with activities of the past and present. The association with  two different locations in space is free from contradiction on account of the difference in  the time of such association. Even if the secondary meaning is adopted, both the terms  should not be understood in that implied manner, because adoption of secondary meaning  for one of the terms would resolve the contradiction. And we have urged that there is no  secondary meaning whatever in the instance under discussion. The absence of  the secondary meaning follows from the fact that no contradiction is involved in the  association of an entity with a different point in space at a past instant and its association  with another point at the present instant. 
4.  Thus even here, in the case of the aphorism, ‘That thou art’, Brahman the cause of the  universe, being the self of the jiva, as its inner ruler, involves no contradiction whatever. It  is Such unification of the import of terms in their natural significance that is brought out in  co-ordinate predication (samanadhikaranya). The reference to the identity of the pure  substratum, through the rejection of the natural significance of the co-ordinate terms, is not  the meaning of co-ordinate predication. The experts on such matters define it thus: ‘The  signification of an identical entity by several terms which are applied to that entity on  different grounds is co-ordinate predication’. Our explanation of this instance entirely  fulfils that principle. The identical import of terms taken in their natural signification is  brought out by us. 
5.  Moreover, it is incorrect to construe the concluding proposition in a way that would  stultify the initial declaration. The initial declaration is, ‘It thought “Let me be  many” (Chan. 6:2:3)’ etc. It affirms that Brahman’s will is unfailingly realized and that it is  the sole cause of the world. The opposite view will make Brahman the locus of  nescience etc., and such imperfections as liability to nescience would flagrantly contradict  the initial assertion of perfections. 
6.  Further, to proceed to a more general consideration, verbal testimony owes its  authoritativeness to being made up of words and sentences corresponding to various  referents of’ the words and their specific inter-relations. Hence verbal testimony of this  nature can never communicate knowledge of an undifferentiated entity. Therefore verbal  testimony cannot furnish the proof for such an entity. Even terms like ‘undifferentiated’ 
17 
deny of the subject of discourse characteristics belonging to other entities and the subject  would then be conceived as characterized by other characteristics. If they function otherwise, they impart no information whatever. Even a single word constituted of its root  and affix embodies several determinate constituents of meaning and a sentence conveys the  combination of such determinate meanings as it is a combination of words with  determinate meanings. 
1.  It may be objected as follows: Now, we do not hold that scripture is a means for  knowing about the undifferentiated and self-luminous Reality. The Reality being self evident does not stand in need of any proof. The scriptural statements only serve to negate  the differentiations like being the subject, object or process of knowing, which  differentiations eclipses the self-luminous principle. When all such eclipsing  differentiations are eliminated, the pure Reality, unconditioned and self-revealing, abides  by its own right. 
2.  (Reply): This contention cannot stand. By what term is that reality indicated while  negating the differentiations of it? It cannot be said that it is indicated by the term ‘Pure  Knowledge’, for even that term points to a differentiated reality That term contains within  itself both a root and affix and thereby has a determinate import. It represents by its root  ‘jña’ a particular activity (of the mind), which is related to an object and belongs to a  subject. The process of knowing differentiates itself from all other activities. All this  reference to a subject and object and difference from other operations is embodied in the  meaning of the root ‘jña’ (to know) itself. The affix points out the other particulars like  gender and number. Even if knowledge is self-evident, it must be self-evident as such, as  being of this determinate nature. Otherwise it is in no way evident. Further, the self-evident  character of knowledge is proved on the ground that it is the cause of the revelation of  other things. 
3.  Moreover, if the entire nature of Brahman shines by itself always, it would be  impossible that the properties of anything else could be superimposed on it. Surely  when the nature of the rope is fully apprehended, the snake cannot be superimposed on it.  It is precisely for this reason that you postulate a nescience, that is supposed to conceal  the real. It is for this reason again, it should be held that scriptural knowledge destructive  of the world-illusion, must be about that part of Brahman which is concealed. Otherwise it  cannot destroy the illusion. Indeed the ‘snakeness’, superimposed on the rope can be  eliminated only by the apprehension of its ‘ropeness’, which latter aspect is over and  above that aspect of rope which was apprehended even through the illusion. If you admit  some one differentiating attribute characterizing pure knowledge and admit that this  attribute is connoted by the word standing for Brahman, the logical consequence would be  that Brahman characterized by all the attributes, affirmed by all the scriptural texts, must  be admitted. Therefore, for those who go by proofs, there is no proof for an  undifferentiated reality. 
4.  Even in the case of indeterminate perception, an object distinguished by characteristics  is apprehended. Otherwise in determinate perception the recognition of the characteristics  previously observed (in the indeterminate perception) would not occur as in the perceptual  judgement, ‘This is he’. The characteristics like ‘cowness’ are of the nature of the structure  (form) of the objects. In the state of indeterminate perception also, objects are apprehended  as characterised by their structures as in the perceptual judgement, ‘This of this character’.  In the second and later apprehensions the commonness of the same form to other objects is  cognised. The second and latter perceptions are designated determinate, because in them  the possession of the same structure as their characteristic by many objects is grasped. For 
18 
the same reason, the view maintaining both the difference and the identity of things, and  thus positing the (self-contradictory) twofoldness of reality stands rejected as  untenable. Structure being the mode of a substance, is different from its Substantive  essence. Because it is a mode, it does not exist independently of its substantive substratum.  Because it is a mode, it is not cognised independently of the substance of which it is the  mode. For these reasons, the twofold character is unity and difference cannot be affirmed  of reality. 
1.  And again those who assert that Reality is un- differentiated and that particular  characterizations eclipsing the self-luminous Reality are eliminated by scriptural texts must  point out what such eliminating texts are. 
(Objection): ‘On speech depend changes and names, but clay alone is true (Cha. 6:1:4)’ is  what is stated. It means that modifications and names have no basis except mere words;  and what is indicated there as the cause, is the only Reality and all else is unreal. 
1.  (Reply): If this be said, we urge that such an explanation is unreasonable. As the  knowledge of the ‘one’ is declared to lead to the knowledge of ‘all’, the pupil questions the  possibility of the knowledge of one entity leading to the knowledge of others. In reply it is  maintained by the teacher that I f one substance itself takes on, through actual  modifications, a plurality of real forms, then the knowing of that one substance leads to the  knowledge of its modifications, for though they have forms different from the causal form, 
there is continuity of substantive essence. For explaining this principle, the illustration  under discussion is offered. It denies no differentiation as alleged. The text means  as follows: “Through Speech” means through practical use commencing with verbal  reference. ‘Arambhana’ means association. The clay having the form of a lump has a  different name and different uses. The same clay having the form of a pot etc., for instance,  has different names and different uses. Even then the same clay-substance takes different  names, different forms and serves different purposes. Thus the substance, clay, is real all  through. Thus the possibility of knowing one thing by knowing another is exemplified.  That this passage negates nothing has already been explained. 
1.  If you were to argue that the proposition, ‘By which that which was not heard of,  becomes heard of (Chan. 6:1: 3)’ etc., means that everything other than Brahman is unreal,  we urge in reply that, in that case, the illustration of clay and its modification (Chan. 6:1:4)  would not serve to establish that purport. That clay-products like a jar are unreal, like the  snake-in-the-rope, is not a point that is obvious and well-known to Svetaketu through any  other valid source of knowledge and reasoning. If it be said, ‘Even that point is sought to  be established in this proposition’, we say that it cannot be the case for if so, reference to  the illustration as a previously well-established matter would be impossible. 
2.  (Objection): But, by the two terms of exclusive emphasis in the phrases, ‘Being alone’  and ‘One only’ and by the expression, ‘Without a second’ all entities other than pure Being  both of the same kind as well as of a different kind are repudiated. 
(Reply): The reply to this is that the matter is not so. That the same substance is the cause  in one state and is the effect in another state and that by the understanding of that substance  in its causal state, we understand it as existing in another state also owing to the continuity  of substance are the principles that are explained to Svetaketu with illustrations. Then the  fundamental truth that Brahman is the cause of all, altogether unknown to Svetaketu,  is introduced in the words, ‘Being itself, this was in the beginning’.
19 
1.  It means, ‘This, in the beginning, was Being itself’. The words, ‘In the beginning’  signify a particular period of time, and the term ‘was’ signifies a particular mode of  activity consisting of fusion with Being implying that the world has Being as its  substantive essence. The words ‘One only’ signify that differentiations of names and forms  were non-existent then. When these ideas are clearly laid down, it becomes manifest that  the world has ‘Being’ as its material cause. In other cases of causation, the material cause  requires an efficient cause other than itself. But in this case of cosmic causation the  omniscient Brahman, being unique, transcendent and being distinguished from everything  else, there is no contradiction involved in its being omnipotent. The words ‘without a  second’ affirm the absence of another intelligent cause. This wholly follows from the  omnipotence of Brahman. Some texts state first that Brahman is the material cause and  then add that the efficient cause is also Brahman itself. To this class of texts belongs the  present passage. 
2.  Other texts begin with the statement that Brahman is the efficient cause and then raise  the question as to how it can be the material cause also and develop the answer  that Brahman, being omnipotent, can be the material cause also and all other accessory  causes as well. The following passage (Rig. 10:6:13:4) is an instance in point: ‘What was  the wood, what was the tree, from which they shaped the heaven and earth? You wise  ones, search in your minds; where on fie stood, supporting the worlds? Brahman was the  wood, Brahman the tree from which they shaped heaven and earth; you, wise ones, I tell  you, he stood on Brahman, supporting the worlds’. The oneness of the material and  efficient cause is questioned on the ground of the common conception of causation and is  supported in answer, on the ground of the uniqueness and uncommon power of Brahman. 
3.  Therefore in the very statement, ‘Being alone, this was in the beginning (Chan. 6:2:1)’  several differentiations are affirmed in relation to Brahman by phrases like ‘in  the beginning’. There is not a single word whatever which negates distinctions as you  desire. ‘In the beginning’ implies the existence of a specific time. ‘Was’ implies a specific  mode of action. The attribute of being the material cause and the attribute of being the  efficient cause are also ascribed to Brahman. The denial of the dualism of material and  efficient causes brings in the all-accomplishing power of Brahman — Thus differentiations  are posited in thousands, which are not matters of previous knowledge. 
4.  The passage propounds areal causal relation between Brahman and the world. Precisely  for this reason it undertakes to refute the view that the effect does not pre-exist in the  cause. To this effect is the section starting from, ‘Non- being alone this was in the  beginning (Chan. 6:2:2)’. It goes on, ‘How can that be? If the effect, it is urged in criticism,  does not pre-exist in its cause, its origination amounts to causeless origination. It asks,  ‘How can Being originate from Non-being?’ That which originates from Non- being must  be of the nature of Non-being, even as a product of clay is of the nature of clay. The  origination of something that is already existent means just its passage into a new state in  order to make a new use possible. 
5.  The position concerning causation out of the previous existence of the effect can be  explained as follows: The same causal substance is called effect by passing into a different  state. On this basis the knowledge of ‘one’ leading to the knowledge of ‘all’ was  elucidated. That account of one knowledge leading to all knowledge is objected to by  the theory of causation on which the effect does not pre-exist as I lie cause. That theory  may be put thus: Out of the efficient, material and instrumental causes, a new substance, a  new composite entity, other than all the causal factors comes into being. The entity that  constitutes the effect is, in consequence, different from the entity constituting the 
20 
cause. Hence the knowledge of cause can, in no way, render the effects known. How can  the novel composite entity be repudiated ? In reply to this it may be said that the  causal substance (or substances) undergoes a change or enters into a new state of being  according to all theories including the present theory asserting the origination of a new  substance. This passage of the causal substance into a new state can itself account for the  three factors, the unity of the effect, its bearing a new name and its capacity to serve a new  purpose and such other factors to account for which the origination of a new entity is  posited. And also no new substance is observed in the effect, over and above, the  constitutive elements in a new state of being. For these reasons, it is maintained that the  cause itself passing into a new state of being constitutes the effect. 
1.  (Objection): Now this is not the purport of the (Upanishad) discussion. The idea of the  origination of a new substance in causation is repudiated just to establish that all illusion  rests upon the substratum of reality. The only reality, pure consciousness, enmeshed in  nescience appears falsely as the world. The reality of the primordial cause must  be presupposed as furnishing the substratum for that nescience. it is for this purpose that  the origination of the previously non-existent is disproved in the passage. 
(Reply): This way of construing the text is not correct. The theory of the origination of an  effect from its own previous existence becomes relevant to and its consideration is  directly necessitated by the initial proposition about the knowledge of the one issuing in  the knowledge of all and the illustrations offered in support. 
1.  On your theory it is Impossible to maintain that an illusion rests on a real basis. If a  thinker admits that a sentient being is subject to real defects, and that its liability to defects  is real, then only can he account for the fact of illusion, the real defects producing the  perception of unreal phenomena. But for a philosopher, according to whom the defects are  unreal and the ‘liability to defects is also unreal, it should not be impossible to admit an  illusion on a fictitious basis as well. Therefore you cannot rule out the possibility of  illusion resting on a fictitious substratum. 
2.  Coming to those passages in the Scriptures which aim at determining the nature of  Brahman, the direction of interpretation has already been laid down. The definitive  sentences like ‘Brahman is real, knowledge and infinite (Tai. 2:2)’ and ‘Brahman is bliss  (Tai. 3:6)’ following the principle of co-ordinate predication, define Brahmin as  characterized by plurality of qualities. There is no contradiction involved in the procedure.  Brahman characterized by all the qualities is thus presented. If it be said that negation is  conveyed in many ways as in the declaration, ‘Then, therefore, the instruction is, “Not so,  not so” (Brh. Ar. 4:3:6)’ we urge that what exactly is negated here must be determined. If it  is pointed out that the whole universe consisting of forms and formless principles as  enumerated in the sentence, ‘There are two aspects of Brahman that with form and that  without, form (Brh. Ar. 4:3:1)’ is negated here by the instruction ‘Not so, not so’, we  contend that this is an unreasonable method of interpretation. After imparting the  knowledge that all that, which from the normal empirical point of view is not known as an  aspect of Brahman, constitutes an aspect of Brahman, to go on to negate It is surely a very  unreasonable method of discourse. The rule is that ‘it is better to avoid mire from a  distance than to wash it off after staining oneself with it’. 
3.  Then, what is the import of this negative proposition ? The author of the Vedanta Sutras (3:2:22) himself furnishes the interpretation: ‘That the aforesaid principles exhaust  the forms of Brahman is what is denied, just because the passage goes on to speak of the  further glories of Brahman.’ The further text of the Shruti is ‘Then its name is “The real21 
of the reals”, for life-principles are real and this is more real than life-principles (Brh. Ar.  4:3:6)’. Thus further attributes are praised in the subsequent portions of the text. Therefore  the text, ‘Not so, not so’ fundamentally means that Brahman is not confined to the aspects  enumerated. Thus the finitude of Brahman is what is denied in the text in question. 
1.  If it be said that the dictum, ‘There is no plurality here (Brh. Ar. 6:4:19)’ and many  other texts repudiate plurality, we explain as follows — The text adduced is followed  immediately in the same discourse of the Upanishad by the glorification of the ‘Ruler of  all, the Lord of all (Brh. Ar. 6:4:22)’. The subsequent texts assert that Brahman’s will  comes true and that Brahman is the Lord of all. The truth is that the supreme ruler has all  sentient and non-sentient entities as his body and has them as his modes. He is the sole lord  of all existence. Plurality of existence as not sustained and ensouled by Brahman is  repudiated in this passage. It is this plurality, antithetical to the assertion of the absolute  supremacy of the highest Self that is denied. So this denial of plurality does not meet the  requirements of your position. All texts of this character follow this fundamental principle.  Nowhere, therefore, do we meet with a scriptural utterance that repudiates all  differentiations. 
2.  Further you hold that pure undifferentiated knowledge is Brahman and having its  essential nature veiled by the veiling nescience, it observes pluralities within itself.  Now this is an untenable doctrine. Veiling means elimination of light. As you do not admit  an attributive light distinct from the substantive nature of Brahman, and as you hold that  the substantive nature of Brahman is this light of knowledge, the postulated elimination of  light would be the destruction of the substantive nature of Brahman. If it be said, ‘Light  here means knowledge. Knowledge is eternal. The light of knowledge is veiled by  nescience, we say in reply that these are contentions indicative of immaturity of thought. If  the light is concealed by nescience, this concealment should take one of these two forms: It  must obstruct the generation of light or it must annihilate the existing light. Since you do  not admit that this light is subject to processes like generation, the concealment posited can  be nothing but annihilation. When you assert that it is eternal and immutable and it abides  as such, you are saying In effect that though nescience is there, nothing is concealed in  Brahman. In the same breath you say that Brahman observes plurality. Surely a doctrine  like this cannot be submitted to the scrutiny of those who know. 
3.  (Objection): But you too must hold that the essential nature of the Atman is  consciousness. Atman is self-luminous. To account for its wrong identification with  the body, the concealment of the essential nature must be postulated. If the nature of an  entity stands revealed, it is impossible that characteristics that do not belong to it can  be wrongly attributed to it. Therefore, the difficulty, you urge against us, faces you also.  Indeed the position is far worse for you. Since we maintain that there is only one self,  the unaccountability urged, attaches to our account of that one single entity. As you uphold  the existence of an infinite number of selves, you have to face this charge of  unaccountability in your account of all those infinite number of entities. 
4.  (Reply): Our thesis about the Reality and the ways of knowing can be formulated n this  way: The supreme Brahman is by its inherent nature antithetical to all imperfections. Its  substantive nature consists solely of infinite knowledge and bliss. It is an ocean of exalted  attributes which are natural to it and are all-surpassing in their excellence. Its glories are  boundless and not tainted by mutations in time, time which is the operative principle  of change in the form of origination, subsistence and destruction and consists of limitless  number of units, like seconds, minutes, hours up to vast epochs. Brahman has as the  instruments of its mighty sport and as forming its own parts an infinite number of 
22 
individual souls bound as well as free and also the physical universe, which latter has the  power of passing through evolutions marvellous and boundless. Brahman is the inner ruler  of the finite selves and the non-sentient nature. They form its body. It owns them as its  modes. Such supreme Brahman is the reality to be known. The Veda, Rik. Yajus, Saman  and Atharvan, branching forth thousand- fold, beginningless and endless in its unbroken  tradition, embodying the ultimate truth, is the basis of philosophical knowledge. This, in all  its three sections, namely, injunctions, explanations and hymns, is supported and  interpreted by the Itihasas, Puranas, and Dharma Shastras, composed by the great sages,  like Bhagavan Dvaipayana, Parashara, Valmiki, Manu, Yajñavalkya, Gautama and  Apastamba, who have attained the direct vision of the supreme Brahman. This body of  transcendent knowledge, interpreted and augmented in the supplementary sacred texts of  these perfect sages, is the final authority. Can there be any insuperable difficulty for us,  possessed of this magnificent conception of knowledge and reality? 
1.  Bhagavan Dvaipayana says in the Mahabharata:— ‘He who knows me, the birthless,  and beginningless One, the supreme Lord of the worlds (Gita, 10:3)’ and ‘There are  two persons in the world, the perishable and the imperishable. All creatures are the  perishable Purusha. The immutable One is the imperishable Purusha. The Purusha who is  other than and far surpassing these two is called the supreme Atman. He fills the three  worlds and sustains them. He is the everlasting Godhead, (Gita, 15:26)’. ‘Time is subdued  there by him. Time is not the master there. All these are places of punishment in contrast to  the blessed region of the highest Atman’ and ‘All this, beginning from the unmanifested  to the particular objects in creation, is subject to mutation and growth. Let all this be  understood as the perishable embodiment of Hari’s cosmic play (Bha. Moksha,  25:9)’. ‘Krishna is the beginning and the end of all the worlds. The entire universe of  animate and inanimate existences is for his sake (Bha. Sabha, 38: 23)’. The terms ‘for his  sake’ mean that it has value only in being instrumental to him. 
2.  Bhagavan Parashara also says: ‘Maitreya, the name “Bhagavat” is applied to the pure  One of infinite glory, to the supreme Brahman, who is the cause of all causes (Vi,  6:5:72)’ ‘The word “Bhagavat” signifies knowledge, power of action, sustaining strength,  sovereignty (in rule), energy and radiance. It signifies these perfections in their entirety and  also the total exclusion of evil attributes (Vi, 6:5:79)’. ‘Thus the great name “Bhagavat”  denotes Vasudeva, the highest Brahman. It applies to none else. It also carries the  significance of the word “adorable”. Its application to the highest One, Vasudeva, is direct  and primary. When it is used for any one else, it is used in a secondary sense (Vi,  6:5:75)’. ‘Such is the ultimate ideal called “Vishnu”. It is pure, real, omnipresent, and  imperishable. It transcends all evil (Vi. Pu. 1:22:53)’. ‘Time consisting of durational units  like kala and muhurta, has no power of affecting his glory with change (Vi, 1:2: 84)’.  ‘Look at him, sporting like a boy (Vi, 1:2:18)’. 
3.  Manu also voices forth the same truth: ‘He is the supreme law-giver for all. He is  subtler than the subtlest (M.S.22:122)’. Yajñavalkya also says: ‘The individual spirit  attains the highest purity through the knowledge of God (34)’. Apastamba has it thus: ‘All  pranis are the puh of this One, the in dweller in all caverns (20:4)’. Puh means ‘city’. That  means body. ‘Pranis’ means creatures which are material configurations ensouled by  individual selves. 
4.  (Objection): But what is the use of all this flourish? Our criticism remains unanswered. (Reply): The answer follows. For us who hold this conception of Brahman and the Veda,  the criticism has no force. Consciousness, we maintain, though an inherent attribute of the  individual is subject to real contraction and expansion by the force of karma. Thus the 
23 
difficulty urged is eliminated. For you, consciousness is the substantive nature of the self  and not its attribute. You do not admit either contraction or expansion. In our account,  concealing factors like karma, bring about the non-origination of the spread of  consciousness. If the nature of nescience is to veil, nescience, the agency that veils, must  be, as urged before, destructive of the essential nature of consciousness itself. According to  us karma, in the form of nescience, brings about the contraction of the consciousness that  is an eternal attribute of the substantive nature of the atman. By virtue of this contraction  arises the wrong attitude to the self, taking it for gods, men, or any other empirical  creature. 
1.  This position has been laid down thus: ‘The third power is nescience called karma. By  this, the all-penetrating power of the individual knower is over-powered. Hence it becomes  subject to the persistent afflictions of samsara. Concealed by nescience, the power, called  the individual knower, exists in all creatures in various grades (Vi. Pu. 6:7:61—63)’. Thus  the scripture points out that nescience, called karma, causes the contraction and expansion  of the consciousness which forms a natural attribute of the individual self. 
2.  (Objection): This principle of concealing nescience has been postulated for two  reasons: Some sacred texts posit it and the teaching of identity between the jiva and  Brahman necessitates it. It has been maintained that this nescience veils the nature of  Brahman. 
(Reply): Now, we argue that this nescience is also phenomenal and unreal. Just as the  manifold world being unreal, can become an object of perception only owing to a defect,  namely this nescience, this nescience also, being equally phenomenal, presupposes a defect  to account for its becoming an object of perception. Therefore nescience itself cannot be  considered the fundamental and original defect, at the root of all illusion. Thus you will be  driven to regard Brahman itself as the root of all illusions. Even if nescience is considered  beginningless, since it can be beginningless only as phenomenal and as such, only as an  object of the perception of Brahman, and since you do not admit a real, non-phenomenal  defects as its root, Brahman itself must be the source of the illusory perception of  nescience. Brahman being eternal, it follows that there can be no liberation. 
1.  The foregoing refutes by implication the following also: Only one body is animated by  a jiva. The other bodies are not so inhabited by jivas, as in the case of bodies seen in  dreams. In dream, the body of the dreamer alone is ensouled. The many bodies that one  observes n dreams are not ensouled. This one jiva of the dreamer fictitiously imagines the  other jivas and their bodies as existing. Therefore all (other) jivas are unreal. 
2.  Really on your hypothesis, Brahman fictitiously sets up in imagination individuation  and all bodies, both of which are other than its essential nature. Even in a single  body, since the body and likewise the individuation of the jiva in it, are unreal, all bodies  are unreal and the individuation of the jiva in all of them is unreal. This being the case,  there is no meaning in attaching any speciality to a single body and the individuation of the  self in relation to it. In our account of the matter, the dreamer’s body and the existence of  the self in it, are not sublated in the waking state. The other bodies seen in dream and the  individual souls embodied in them are sublated in the waking state. Therefore the latter are  all unreal and the dreamer’s body and soul are real. Herein lies the distinction. 
3.  Further, how is nescience eliminated? What is the nature of the elimination? These  questions should be discussed.
24 
(Objection): The unitive knowledge is the means for putting an end to nescience. The  nature of that elimination of nescience lies in its being antithetical to the  ‘indefinable’ nescience and its effects. 
1.  (Reply): If this be your view, the following objection arises. To be antithetical to the  ‘Indefinable’ is to be definable. The ‘definable’ must be either existent or non- existent or  both. There is no fourth alternative. If this ‘definable’ termination of nescience is admitted  to be other than Brahman, nescience (being the cause of the perception of everything other  than Brahman) remains un-eliminated. If Brahman itself is this elimination of nescience,  the former being eternally real, this elimination must also be held to have existed eternally.  Thus the elimination of nescience remains an accomplished fact prior to the rise of the  knowledge of Vedanta. In consequence your philosophy holding that the unitive  knowledge eliminates nescience and that the absence of the knowledge constitutes bondage  stands nullified. 
2.  And again, the knowledge effecting the elimination of nescience is also, on your  theory, a particular form of nescience. Through what means is that specific form  of nescience removed? ‘This knowledge eliminating nescience, eliminates all  differentiations first and then, being momentary, disappears by itself without any other  cause bringing about its disappearance. There are instances of self-annihilation in nature,  like forest-fire and poison administered to expel poison’. This argument is not open to you.  This knowledge causing the termination of nescience is conceived by you as being other  than Brahman. As such, its nature and the events connected with it like its origination and  annihilation have only phenomenal existence. Therefore, the nescience, that consists in  bringing about the perception of this phenomenal event, namely, the annihilation of the  eliminating knowledge, continues to exist. You have to provide for the factor  that eliminates the nescience which consists in the perception of the self-annihilation of the  knowledge that brings about the elimination of cosmic nescience. In the case of forest-fire  etc., what disappears continues to exist in states other than the previous one and this  continuance in and through a chain of states obtains necessarily. 
3.  And now let us turn to the knower involved in the knowledge that negates everything  other than Brahman, which is of the nature of pure consciousness. Is that knower the ego  that emerges from the fictitious subject-object superimposition? That would be untenable,  for that ego falls within the area of the object of negation and therefore cannot be the  subject of negation. If it be said that the knower is Brahman itself, then the question arises  whether that knowership of Brahman is real or superimposed. If it is superimposed, then  this superimposition and the nescience at the bottom of the superimposition, remain falling  outside the scope of the negating knowledge. If another means is posited for the negation  of that superimposition and the nescience that is its basis, that means also must be  knowledge and must therefore involve the three factors, knower, knowledge and the  known. Further discussion about this new knowledge, which is inevitable, lands the  argument in infinite regress. All knowledge, bereft of these three factors, loses the  character of being knowledge. All knowledge is the apprehension of an object by a subject.  Any knowledge that is not of this nature would be incapable of eliminating nescience, even  as the consciousness constitutive of Brahman’s nature — being devoid of this nature — is  not capable of eliminating illusion. If you admit that the non-phenomenal nature of  Brahman itself is to be the knower, you are accepting our theory itself. 
4.  The proposition that the knowledge that eliminates nescience and its effects and the  knowership of the knower in that knowledge are also included in the body of what  is eliminated sounds ridiculous like the proposition that ‘Everything other than the floor 
25 
was cut by Devadatta and therefore in that process of cutting, the action of cutting, and the  fact of Devadatta being a cutter, were also included in the body o f what was cut’. 
1.  Now, what is the source of this knowledge of unity, which eliminates plurality? If it be  answered that Shruti is the source, there is a difficulty. Shruti is different from  Brahman and like everything else different from Brahman, it is a fabrication of nescience  and therefore cannot give rise to the knowledge that negates the world. To explain: The  illusion of snake generated by the deficiencies of the perceptual system, cannot be  cancelled, by another cognition of the form, ‘This is a rope and not a snake’, if that  cognition owes its own origin to similar deficiencies of the perceptual system. When there  is fear proceeding from the illusion of snake, the speech of another person, who is himself  the victim of an illusion and who is known to be such a victim, even if he were to say,  ‘This is no snake, it is just a rope’, can remove neither the first illusory cognition nor the  fear born of it. This applies to the present case, because to the competent student at the  very time of his learning the Shruti, the Shruti is known to be different from the pure  Brahman and hence to be a production by illusion. 
2.  It also follows as the knowledge that is to eliminate the cosmic illusion, the knower in  that knowledge and the source of that knowledge, namely, the scriptures, are all different  from Brahman and therefore liable to negation, the sublation of the world would be unreal  and the world, the contradictory of the sublation, must be treated as real. The man seen in  the dream may report one’s son’s death in the dream and his words being false, the son  would be alive of necessity. And again, the passage like ‘That thou art’ are powerless to  sublate the world, for they are products of illusion, just as the speech of the deluded man,  known as such, seeking to correct the illusory cognition of the snake by another is  powerless to effect the correction. 
3.  But, it may be argued, ‘supposing a man is experiencing some terror in a dream. The  terror will surely disappear, if in the same dream, the dreamer were to get the knowledge  that the terror-causing experience was a mere dream. Even so is the situation here’. The  explanation cannot be sustained. If in the same dream one were to get a further knowledge  that the knowledge that removed the terror was itself a dream, the original terror will return  and continue. Thus the explanation does not improve the position. The basis of the  objection is the fact that even during the learning of the scriptures, it is being learnt by  the student that the scriptures are also illusory like dreams. 
4.  A further point is made by you: Though the scriptures are fabrications of illusion and  therefore unreal, the content of the scriptures, ‘Pure Being’, happening to be unsublated in  later experience, they do impart the knowledge that ‘Brahman is absolute existence, one  without a second, (Chan. 6:2:1)’. This is also illogical. The doctrine upholding ‘shunya’ 
(nothingness or the void) as the ultimate, furnishes the sublation of the content of the  scriptures as described by you. You cannot urge that the doctrine of ‘shunya’ originates from error, for the sacred texts also like, ‘Brahman is absolute existence, one  without a second’ are products of error according to your own view. The distinction lies in  the fact that only the assertion of ‘shunya’ is free from subsequent sublation. The  upholders of the doctrine of ‘shunya’ and those who deny the reality of everything other  than Brahman have no right to philosophy; for they both refuse to admit the reality of the  sources of knowledge, on which, they base their systems. This has been pointed out by the  revered teachers: ‘The philosophers of “shunya” have no right to dialectics, because they  have no means of knowledge.’26 
1.  By what means of knowledge is it established that the world revealed by perception is  unreal? If it is contended that perception is tainted by a defective origin and that  its deliverances can be accounted for without admitting their truth, while the sacred  scripture is flawless in origin and its deliverances cannot be accounted for except by the  admission of their truth and therefore scriptural knowledge can sublate perception, it is  necessary for the completion of the argument to specify the exact defect that falsifies  perceptual experience which presents to us the world of measureless multiplicity. You  describe the defect as the beginningless pluralistic predilection. But alas ! the sacred  scripture also, on your hypothesis, suffers from the same defect. Since the radical defect is  common, it is impossible that one of the two, scripture and perception, can bring about the  sublation of the other. 
2.  Our own method of adjusting the claims of these sources of knowledge is free from  these inconsistencies. Perception is the apprehension of elements like ether and air and  their products possessing properties like touch and sound and existing in forms like that of  men, animals and other objects. The theme of scriptures comprehends principles  not determinable by perception. They are the nature of Brahman, characterized by infinite  attributes, like omniscience, the pervasive immanence in all as their ultimate self and  absolute reality, the various modes of worship of Brahman like devout meditation, the  attainment of Brahman and the attainment of the summum bonum, following that  meditation and issuing out of the grace of Brahman and the particular methods  of suppressing and eliminating the root of all evil, which consists in going contrary to  Brahman. 
3.  The thinkers who hold that the scripture is superior to other means of knowledge, on  the ground of innumerable excellences like its enjoying unbroken continuity of  tradition, without beginning and end are obliged, logically, to admit the veracity of  perception. The theory under discussion is inherently weak, being a vicious view  proceeding from unsound logic. It is further assailed by hundreds of Vedic declarations. As  its critical examination conducted so far is quite ample, we conclude its refutation. 
4.  The second view admits no entities besides Brahman and the limiting adjunct. Hence  the limiting adjunct must operate on Brahman itself. All the imperfection arising out of the  operation of the limiting adjunct must affect Brahman itself, as they arise within it. In  consequence, the texts speaking of Brahman being free from sin and other imperfections,  get nullified. 
5.  (Objection): It may be argued that the universal space is different from space  conditioned by a jar, because the latter is limited. There is thus a difference  between universal space and the limited space contained in a jar. The merits or defects  pertaining to the limited space do not affect the universal space. Even so is the case in the  present context. The imperfections belong to the individual self, whose distinction from all  else is determined by the limiting adjunct. The unconditioned Brahman is free from  these imperfections. 
(Reply): We answer that the explanation is not correct — Space being part less and non composite, cannot be divided. The limiting conditions like the jar cannot break it up  into parts. Therefore the universal space itself is in conjunction with the conditions like the  jar. Similarly Brahman being invisible, the limiting conditions must condition  Brahman itself.
27 
1.  If you maintain that the part of space conditioned by the jar is distinct from other parts  of space, a fresh difficulty crops up. The universal space is one and the jar is not fixed to  any one part of it. If the jar is moved, it conditions different parts of space at successive  moments without any fixities of conjunction to or separation from any part of space. On  the same principle, the limiting machinery, the cause of bondage, when in motion must  come in conjunction with different parts of Brahman without any fixity of association.  These parts are ex-hypothesi mutually distinct. The upshot of this is the implication that the  limiting condition is actually in conjunction with Brahman invariably, not with any  particular part thereof and that every moment, when the limiting physical machinery of the  body is in motion, there must be spontaneous release and bondage respectively for the part  of Brahman from which the machinery moves and the part of Brahman to which it moves. 
2.  (Objection): The impartite space itself is the organ of hearing; but still the organ of  hearing is a well-determined part of space and not the whole space indefinitely. On  the same principle the phenomenon of individuation can be explained. 
(Reply): If this be said, we do not accept the explanation. Space by itself is not the organ of  hearing. Only that part of space, which is conjoined with the region of the ear which is  influenced by a particular kind of air, constitutes the organ of hearing. Even if there is no  fixity of conjunction between any part of space and the region of the ear, there is no  difficulty in accounting for the location of the organ of hearing in a particular part of space.  Just as space, without any fixity of points of contact, comes in conjunction with  the moving organisms, Brahman’s parts also must be conceived as coming in conjunction  with the moving limiting adjuncts without any definiteness and fixity of one to one  conjunction. 
1.  The phenomenon of specific location of the organ of hearing in space has been  explained, assuming for the sake of the argument, the theory that space becomes the organ  of hearing. But, as a matter of fact, space (or ether) does not constitute the organ of  hearing. The Vedic view is that the eleven senses are the products of the vaikarika 
(sattvika) ahankara. It has been so enunciated by Bhagavan Parashara:— ‘Some say that  the senses are taijasa (products of rajasika ahankara). But in reality, the ten senses and the  mind, the eleventh sense, are vaikarika’. The meaning of the verse is as follows: There are  three kinds of ahankaras — vaikarika, taijasa and bhutadi. They are sattvika, rajasik and  tamasik respectively. Elements like space (akasha) are produced by bhutadi ahankara in  the order of creation. A prima facie view holds that the eleven senses are produced by  taijasa. But the correct view, upheld by the author, is that the eleven senses are products of  vaikarika ahankara. By the term ‘devas’ in the text the senses are meant. That the  senses, which are the products of the vaikarika ahankara, are satisfied and nourished by  the elements like akasha (and are not produced by them) is laid down in the Mahabharata. 
1.  Even if the senses are the products of the elements, there is no difficulty in accounting  for the determinate localization of the senses, just as there is no difficulty with regard to  bodies, also products of the elements. But Brahman indivisible, non-composite and  changeless, becomes, on this theory, subject to the evil of conjunction with an  infinite number of limiting conditions without any determinate localization of effects.  There is no way of escaping this consequence. The theory is only for the consumption of  the believers and can withstand no open-minded inquiry. The wise, learned in the  philosophical sciences, do not have any esteem for it. 
2.  This school admits that the substantive nature of Brahman is liable to mutation. The  Vedic affirmations of the immutability and perfections of the ultimate are thereby negated. 
28 
If it be said that only the shakti or power of Brahman undergoes change, we ask what this  shakti is. Is shakti a modification of Brahman? Or is it something indefinable but  not different from Brahman? Both these definitions would inevitably imply the mutability  of Brahman in its substantive nature. 
1.  The third standpoint also maintains that there is both identity and difference between  Brahman and the jiva. The position is similar to that of the sage Saubhari, said to have  been embodied in several bodies simultaneously. It is also similar to that of God in relation  to his multiplicity of incarnations. In that case, the evils attaching to the individual selves  would affect the supreme Self itself. The explanation of the school is that God himself, in  his own essential nature exists as the individual selves of the various species— gods, men,  animals and plants and so on. Thus is the universal selfhood of God explained. But the  various uses to which the many products of one lump of clay are put are really the uses of  clay-substance itself. In the same way the joys and sorrows that happen to individual selves  would all be joys and sorrows of God himself. 
2.  (Objection): That part of the substance, clay, which has not been used for making any  of the articles like jar, remains unconnected with the effects of those products of clay. In  the same way the part of God not involved in the formation of the individual selves like those of gods and men, remains in his uncompromising majesty, omniscient and full of  auspicious attributes like having his will always fulfilled. 
(Reply): We admit your explanation and urge the consequence of that explanation, that the  same God is full of perfection in one part of his being and in another part he is equally full  of imperfections. Both are equally parts of God. 
1.  If you say that the two parts of God are distinct and that there is no overlapping, we  ask, ‘What is the gain thereby?’ When the same person is eternally miserable in one part,  his being happy in a different part, cannot raise him to the status of the supreme Godhead.  Suppose one, Devadatta, has one of his arms bedecked with superfine jewels and perfumed  and anointed with sandal paste, while the other arm is hammered and placed in deadly  flames. Such is the predicament of God in this theory. In the final estimate, this theory of  identity and difference is more unholy than even the view that ascribes nescience to  Brahman; for the unlimited sorrow of transmigratory existence is taken as real and that 
transmigratory existence will never cease as an infinite number of individual selves are  posited. 
1.  If you were to say that the jiva-part is different from the other part which is God, you  are adopting our own way of thought. This error results from your taking the identity  taught in the Upanishads as identity of essential substance. If that identity is interpreted in  terms of the relation of body and soul, between the individual self and the supreme Spirit,  there is absolutely no error. Not merely is there no error, but there is also the merit of fully  elucidating the great attributes of God involved in his sustaining the entire universe as its  Ruler. And further, the passages embodying co-ordinate predication are taken in their  direct and primary import. 
2.  Further, an entity cannot have, as already stated identity-cum-difference because of the  essential self-contradictoriness of such a character. If a jar is different from a piece of  cloth, it means that the piece of cloth does not exist in the jar. If it is identical with it, the  piece of cloth must exist in the jar. Such being the nature of the case, the same entity, at  the same time, in the same point of space, being the locus of both the existence and non 
existence of another entity, is a sheer contradiction. It is said that the two entities are one 
29 
by virtue of the same universal inherent in both of them and different by virtue of their  individuality, as individuals. Even on that supposition the contradiction is not removed. If  the universal ‘cowness’ is identical with the individual cows like the one without horns and  the one with broken horns, then the cow without horns must be one with the cow with  broken horns. And again, if the universal ‘cowness’ is both identical with and different  from the individuals, contradiction is inevitable, for, in so far as the universal is the same  as the individuals, the cow with broken horns and the one without horns must be one and  the same and in so far as the universal is different from the individuals, the two must be  different like a horse and a buffalo. 
1.  Features of objects like the universal are the configurations of those objects and their  modes. The objects and their modes are distinct as categories, and the mode does not exist  apart from the object of which it is the mode. Nor is the mode cognised independent of the  object. The configuration is inherent in several objects as their mode. These are  considerations already enunciated. When we judge of any entity as ‘This is that one’, the  sameness of the mode characterizing many objects is the basis, as in the judgement, ‘This  one is also a person holding a staff’. The mode of a substance consisting of features like  the universal is described as the distinguishing character of the substance. It is  the possession of such a mode that furnishes the ground for the proposition, ‘This object is  different’. Such a mode, supplying the ground for differentiating the entity in which it  inheres from other entities, differentiates itself also from all else. It is capable of this  twofold function of differentiation, just as consciousness is revelatory of the objects of  consciousness and is also self-revelatory. It is for this reason that theories holding that  ‘perception is the apprehension of pure being and perception is not the apprehension of  difference’ stand refuted. They are untenable because in perception there is the  apprehension of an entity only as characterized by its configuration consisting of features  like its universal and the same configuration becomes the ground of the subsequent  differentiation of the entity from others on the part of the cognisor in the light of his  subsequent acquaintance with other entities. The error of imputing mutation to the  substantive nature of Brahman has already been exposed. 
2.  ‘He, who dwells in the earth, who is in the earth, whom the earth does not know, whose  body the earth is and who rules the earth from within, he is thy atman, the inner controller  immortal (Brh. Ar. 5:7: 3)’, ‘He who dwells in the self, who is in the self, whom the self  does not know, whose body the self is and who rules the self from within, he is thy atman,  the inner controller the immortal (Brh. Ar. 5:7:22). ‘He who moves within the earth, whose  body the earth is, whom the earth does not know’ etc. and ‘He who moves within the  imperishable, whose body the imperishable is, whom the imperishable does not know, he  who moves within death, whose body death is, whom death does not know, he is the inner  Self of all beings, free from all imperfections, the Divine, the sole God, Narayana (Su. 7)’,  ‘There are two birds always together, two friends; they live on the same tree; of them, one  tastes sweet pippala fruit and the other not eating, shines (Mu. 3:1:1)’, ‘The Self of all, who  has entered into all, the Lord of all created beings (Tait. Ar.. 3: 21)’, ‘Having created that,  it entered into it, having entered it, it became the living and the non-living; .... aye! having  become the real and the unreal, it remained the real (Tai. 2: 6)’, ‘Entering, as this atman,  the jiva .... (Chan. 6:3: 2)’, ‘Comprehending the Self and the directing Supreme, as  different, he gains the grace of the Supreme and attains immortality (Sve. 1;12)’, ‘Having  comprehended the experiencer of pleasures and pains, the objects of his experience and the  directing Supreme, the whole of this threefold Brahman is described by me (Sve. 1;25)’,  ‘The one eternal Spirit who fulfils the desires of the many eternal selves (Sve 2:5:13)’, ‘He  is the Master of primordial nature and of the individual selves. He is the Lord of qualities  (Sve. 6: 33)’, ‘There are two unborn ones, one of them is ignorant and the other knows, 
30 
one is the Lord and the other is the ruled (Sve. 1:17)’; such Shruti texts abound in  hundreds. There are supporting supplementary texts also with the same purport: ‘The  whole universe is thy body; your stability has become the earth (Ra. 6:120:26)’, ‘In all  cases of creation, whatever may be the created being and whoever may be the creator,  ultimately all that is responsible for the creation is the body of Hari (Vi. Pu. 1:20:38)’, ‘I  am the atman, O Arjuna, as dwelling in the hearts of all (Gita, 10:20)’, ‘1 am established in  the hearts of all. From me emanate remembrance, knowledge and ratiocination  (Gita, 15:15)’; such are the words of the sages, like Valmiki, Parashara and Dvaipayana,  who are the best among the knowers of the Vedas. From both the Vedas and the words of  the sages, emerges the following teaching: The supreme Brahman is the self of all. The  sentient and non-sentient entities constitute its body. The body is an entity and has being  only by virtue of its being the mode of the soul of which it is the body. The body and soul,  though characterized by different attributes do not get mixed up. From all this follows the  central teaching that Brahman, with all the non- sentient and sentient entities as its modes,  is the ultimate. The scriptures declare this glory of Brahman by saying that Brahman has  the whole universe as its body. They also identify Brahman and the world in the manner of  co-ordinate predication, which bears in this connection direct and primary meaning. 
1.  Co-ordinate predication is the application of two terms to a single entity through  connotation of its two modes. On our view co-ordinate predication is given its straight  and primary significance. To explain: In the passage affirming identity ‘That thou art’, the  term ‘that’ signifies Brahman, as the cause of the world, as the abode of all perfections. By  the term ‘thou’ also, denotative of the individual self, Brahman itself is signified as the  inner ruler of the jiva, as possessed of it as its body, as existing within the jiva as its self  and as possessing the jiva as its mode. On all other theories, two glaring errors ensue,  namely, that of giving up the governing principle of co-ordination and of ascribing evil to  Brahman itself. 
2.  When we say, ‘Brahman exists thus’, the term ‘thus’ signifies the mode in which the  subject, Brahman, exists. Now the universe of sentient and non-sentient entities, in both its  gross and subtle states, forms the meaning of the term ‘thus’ as it forms the mode of  Brahman. It is only from this standpoint that the passage, ‘Let me become many, let  me grow forth (Chan. 6:2:3)’ becomes meaningful. Ishvara exists as the cause and as the  effect, assuming diversity of forms. The sentient and non-sentient entities constitute those  forms. 
3.  (Objection): ‘But only the generic character (universal) and attributes are seen to be  modes of things and to constitute the meaning of the term ‘thus’. No substance  ever becomes such a mode and the meaning of the term ‘thus’. Therefore, substances,  capable of independent existence, cannot be the meaning of the term ‘thus’ in relation to  Ishvara; nor can they be his modes’. 
(Reply): Even substances like a staff or ear-ring can become modes of other substances as  implied in terms ‘dandin’ (man holding a staff) and ‘kundalin’ (man wearing ear- rings). 
1.  (Objection): The cases instanced are different from the one under consideration. When  a substance itself is a mode of another substance, an affix indicative of possession is used  (indicative of the meaning of ‘having’) as in the examples of staff-bearer and ear-ring wearer. Therefore the individual selves and physical entities, being substances, cannot be  mere modes of Ishvara, like ‘cowness’ in relation to a cow and the terms standing for them  cannot signify God (without the aforesaid affix) as it is contended.31 
(Reply): The terms, cow, horse, man and god signify substances, brought about by specific  combination of basic material elements. They are material products and substances. So  both in empirical usage and Vedic usage, the terms used for them are put in apposition  with terms representing the souls embodied in them, as they are just modes of  those individual selves. We say, ‘Devadatta, owing to particular merit is born a man,  Yajñadatta, owing to sinful actions in the past, is born a cow, another soul, owing to  excessive merit, is born a god’. Thus the bodies being the modes of the souls, the terms  representing the bodies are equated with those signifying the souls and are treated as  standing for the souls themselves. 
1.  The central principle is this: Whatever exists only as an attribute of a substance — be it  a generic character or a quality or a substance itself, there being no speciality attached to  any category in this matter — that being inseparable from that substance, as its mode only,  can be designated as one with that substance. But if a substance, capable of independent  being, comes to from a mode of another substance contingently at only some points of  space and time, the term signifying the modal substance can signify the basic substance  through the use of the possessive affix. Thus all substances, sentient and non-sentient, have  reality and being only as constituting the body and thus as forming the modes of Ishvara  Ishvara. Ishvara, having them as his mode, is designated by the terms denotative of them.  Thus the co-ordinate propositions are quite appropriate. All this has been already  expounded in the course of the interpretation of the passage dealing with the differentiation  of names and forms. 
2.  Therefore, Brahman itself is the effect as it exists having for its mode the  configurations consisting of Prakriti, individual selves, mahat, ahankara, tanmatra,  elements, senses and the product of these, the cosmic sphere of Brahma, made up of the  fourteen worlds, and the varied forms of being like gods, men and animals, and plants.  The knowledge of Brahman in its causal state leads to the knowledge of all. The idea of the  knowledge of the ‘one’ leading to the knowledge of all, becomes, thereby, perfectly  intelligible. Through a consideration of the principles like causation, the great truth that  Brahman is the self of all, as all sentient and non- sentient entities are its modes, is  propounded. 
3.  (Objection): It has been maintained by you that highest Brahman is not subject to  modification in its substantive nature; otherwise the sacred texts proclaiming that  highest Brahman as changeless and flawless are contradicted. In the same breath, it is  maintained by you that the Supreme person is the material cause of the universe in  accordance with the aphorism, ‘It is the material cause, on account of the  opening declaration and the illustrations cited (B.S. 1:4:24)’, on the authority of the  Upanishad declaration of one knowledge leading to all knowledge and the illustrations of  clay and its products etc., cited. To be a material cause is to be subject to modification.  How can these two conflicting assertion be both true ? 
4.  (Reply): (Brahman) inclusive Of individual selves and the universe is maintained to be  the cause as a whole. If Ishvara is admitted to transform himself into the individual self, the  aphorism, ‘The self is not originated, because the scripture denies origination of the self  and also because the scriptural texts speak of the eternity of the self (B.S. 12:3:19)’ is  contradicted. The ascription of partiality and cruelty to Ishvara is repudiated on the ground  of the beginninglessness of the individual selves and the responsibility of their karma for  the inequalities and sufferings of individuals. The aphorisms connected with this issue are,  ‘Partiality and cruelty are not to be ascribed to Brahman, because of the dependence on  karma’, and ‘If it be said, “There is no karma, as there was no differentiation” we deny that 
32 
supposition on the ground of begininglessness; it is reasonable and so found in actuality  (B.S. 2;1:35-36)’. It is also pointed out that if the individual self were to be non-eternal,  there would be actions, unproductive of fruits and experiences of fruits of action, uncaused  by action. 
1.  In the same way the texts state that Prakriti is also beginningless: ‘There is one who is  unborn, has red, white and black colours and gives birth to many creations similar in form.  One “unborn one” abides with her, happy in her company and another “unborn one”  abandons her having experienced the pleasures and pains she could give (Sve. 4:5)’ This  passage points out the unoriginated existence of both the finite selves and nature. ‘From  that the magician fashions the entire world and another is imprisoned in the magic; know  Prakriti to be Maya, the wielder of Maya is the great Lord (Sve. 4:9-10)’. It is pointed out  here that Prakriti is subject to change in its essential being. ‘The cow, without a beginning  and end, is the creatrix fashioning all beings’. 
2.  The Smrtis also say, ‘Know that Prakriti and Purusha are both beginningless (Gita,  13:19),. ‘The earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intellect and ego, these eight constitute a  distinct Prakriti of mine. This is my inferior Prakriti. There is a superior Prakriti of mine.  That, know thou, O Arjuna, is of the nature of the jivas, by which this world is  sustained (Gita, 7:4)’, ‘Utilizing my own Prakriti, I release them into being again and  again (Gita, 9:8)’, ‘Supervised by me the supreme supervising power, Prakriti brings forth  the world of moving and non-moving beings (Gita, 9:10)’. 
3.  Now Prakriti also constitutes the body of Ishvara. Therefore, the term ‘Prakriti’ denotes Ishvara, who is the inner self of Prakriti and has Prakriti as his mode. The term  ‘Purusha’ also denotes Ishvara, who is the inner self of the Purusha and has Purusha as  his mode. Therefore, Ishvara is the indwelling self of the modification of Prakriti as well  as Purusha. This truth is recorded thus: ‘The manifested nature is Vishnu. Even so the  unmanifested nature is Vishnu. The individual self is Vishnu. Time is Vishnu (Vi. Pu.  1:2:18)’ and ‘He, the supreme Lord is the agitator as well as the agitated (Vi. Pu.  1:2:31)’. Thus in the supreme Self, characterized by Prakriti as his mode, there is change  in the aspect of the mode consisting of Prakriti, and changelessness in the substantive  aspect, in which the mode is inherent. In the same way, in the highest Self, characterized  by the individual self as his mode, there are imperfections in, the aspect of the mode  consisting of the individual self, while in the substantive aspect, in which, the mode is  inherent, he is the ruler, free from flaws, the abode of all auspicious attributes and has a  will that unfailingly realizes itself. Thus it is the supreme Lord, that exists in the causal  state and again it is he, that exists in the state of the effect, as the world, of which the  material cause is the supreme Lord himself. In this manner the identity between cause  and effect is to be comprehended and thus all utterances of the sacred scriptures are  rendered free of contradiction. 
4.  Brahman is in the causal state, when its body consists of the individual selves and  physical nature, in their subtle condition not distinguishable by differentiations of name  and form. The passage of the world to this phase of existence is what is termed  ‘dissolution’. Brahman, having as its body, the individual selves and nature, in their  gross manifested condition distinguished by differentiations of names and forms is in the  state of the effect. The assumption of this manifestation and grossness of aspect is  described as ‘creation’. So says Bhagavan Parashara: ‘He is the cause of the effects, the  unoriginated pradhana and Purusha (Vi. Pu. 1:9:37),.
33 
1.  Therefore, terms denotative of primordial nature and individual selves, in all their  states of being, are denotative, in the primary sense itself, of the highest Self, of  which Prakriti and Purusha are the modes and which exists having them as its modes. So  do terms denoting bodies denote the individual selves indwelling in them. Terms like gods  and men, denoting the varied physical bodies, signify in their primary signification, the  individual selves, of which the bodies form modes and forming modes of which they  possess existence. So the sentient and non-sentient beings forming bodies of the Supreme  and thus acquiring their existential status as the modes of the Supreme, all terms denotative  of them are denotative of the Supreme in their principal signification. 
2.  This is the fundamental relationship between the Supreme and the universe of  individual selves and physical entities. It is the relationship of soul and body, the  inseparable relationship of the supporter and the supported, that of the controller and the  controlled, and that of the principal entity and the subsidiary entity. That which takes  possession of another entity entirely as the latter’s support, controller and principal, is  called the soul of that latter entity. That which, in its entirety, depends upon, is controlled  by and subserves another and is therefore its inseparable mode, is called the body of the  latter. Such is the relation between the individual self and its body. Such being the  relationship, the supreme Self, having all as its body, is denoted by all terms. 
3.  So declare the Vedas with massive unanimity: ‘That Goal which all the Vedas reveal  (Ka. 2:95)’ and ‘That in which all the Vedas become one (Tait. Ar.. 3:11)’. The meaning of  all the Vedas becoming one is that all the Vedas are unanimous in their import as that ‘one’  is their purport. The one God existing in the many (Tait. Ar..3:14)’ and ‘The gods do not  comprehend Him, who is verily with them (Tait. Ar..3:11)’; here the word ‘gods’ means  the senses. The senses including the mind of all beings like gods and men, do not  comprehend him, who is verily with them, being the inner ruler and the very soul of all the  beings like gods and men. 
4.  Similar is the drift of the Puranas: ‘We bow down in obeisance to that, in which all  words are eternally established (Vi. Pu. 1:14:3)’. In the entity signified are the  words established truly. ‘The prior cause of all effects, the best significance of words  (Jitante stotra, 7)’ and ‘I am the one theme of all the Vedas (Gita, 15:95)’; All words  signify the inner ruler characterized by the individual souls, along with their bodies. Indeed  the Vedanta text has it, ‘Entering these three deities, as the atman, the jiva, I will  differentiate names and forms’. 
5.  So are the words of Manu: ‘Let one know the controller of all, subtler than the subtlest,  of the radiance of gold, the supreme Person, who is comprehended by the intelligence  operative in dream (M.S.12:122)’. The various descriptions mean as follows. ‘The  controller of all’ means one who has entered into all beings as their inner ruler and thus  controls them all. ‘Subtler than the subtlest’ means that the individuals are subtle as they  pervade all the non-sentient existence and he pervading even the individual selves  is subtler than they. ‘Of the radiance of gold’ means that he has the colour of the sun. ‘To  be comprehended by the intelligence operative in dream’ means that intelligence, like that  in dream-consciousness, can comprehend him. That means that meditation which has  developed the vividness of the clearest perception, is the instrument for attaining him.  ‘Thus some say he is Agni, others say he is Prajapati, others again say that he is Indra,  while some others say he is Prana. Others say that he is the eternal Brahman (Ma. 12:123)’.  ‘Some’ means the Vedic passages. The meaning of the whole text is that like the term  ‘Eternal Brahman’ all the terms like Agni also signify the supreme Brahman only, on the  principle formulated, because, as the controller and self of all, he abides within all. Other 
34 
Smrti texts carry the same purport like in following: ‘Those who worship the manes, gods,  Brahmins along with their sacred fire, worship indeed Vishnu himself, who is the inner self  of all beings (Daksa)’. The terms like manes, gods, Brahmins and fire signify the entities  so named in ordinary discourse and through them ultimately name Vishnu himself who is  the inner soul of all beings. 
1.  The heart of the whole Shastra is this: The individual selves are essentially of the  nature of pure knowledge, devoid of restriction and limitation. They get covered up  by nescience in the shape of karma. The consequence is that the scope and breadth of their  knowledge is curtailed in accordance with their karma. They get embodied in  the multifarious varieties of bodies from Brahma down to the lowest species. The  knowledge is limited in accordance with their specific embodiment. They are deluded  into identification with their bodies. In accordance with them they become subject to joys  and sorrows, which, in essence constitute what is termed ‘the river of  transmigratory existence’. For these individual selves, so lost in samsara, there is no way  of emancipation, other than surrender to the supreme Lord. For the purpose of inculcating  that sole way of emancipation, the first truth to be taught by the Shastra is that the  individual selves are not intrinsically divided into several kinds, like gods, men, etc., and  that they are fundamentally alike and are equal in having knowledge as their essential  nature, The essential nature of the individual self is such that it is wholly subservient and  instrumental to God and therefore God is its inner self. The nature of the supreme Being is  unique, on account of his absolute perfection and absolute antithesis to everything that is  evil. God is the ocean of countless, infinitely excellent attributes. The Shastras further  assert that all sentient and non-sentient entities are sustained and operated by the supreme  Being. Therefore, the Supreme is the ultimate self of all. They teach meditation along with  its accessory conditions as the means for attaining him. 
2.   That these are the quintessential principles may be substantiated: ‘The self is filled  with nirvana; and is filled with knowledge and is pure. Sorrow, ignorance and impurity are  the properties of matter and not of the self (Vi. Pu. 7:7:22)’. The latter are contingent,  having been brought about by karma, which is due to association with matter. They are not  due to the inherent characteristics of the self. By the method of difference, they are stated  to be the properties of matter. 
3.   ‘The wise look upon as equal one blessed with knowledge and humility, a mere  brahmin, a cow, an elephant, a dog and an outcaste (Gita, 5:18)1. The wise are those who  can distinguish the essential nature of the self even though it is associated with any of the  varied kinds of bodies, like the heavenly, human, animal and plant. They are enlightened  about the nature of the self, as transcending the varied and specialized modifications of  material nature. They discern the equal nature of all selves, embodied in the most unequal  and dissimilar material forms. Therefore they are said to have the vision of equality. 
4.   It is further said, ‘Those whose minds are established in equality, have overcome  bondage even while here. The Brahman is stainless and equal. Therefore they  are established in Brahman (Gita, 5:19)’; ‘stainless’ means freed from the stain that  consists in being associated with the various material forms. All selves, existing in their  intrinsic and original character, have only knowledge of the nature of nirvana as their  essential form and therefore are equal. 
5.   Further, the individual self, so constituted, is wholly subservient to the Lord and is  controlled by him and has him as its sole support. This idea has been expressed by  Shruti, Smrti, Itihasa and Purana through the description of the individual self as the body 
35 
of Brahman and through statements affirming the identity of the individual self and  Brahman. All this has been explained before. 
1.   ‘This Maya of mine, characterised by the qualities of sattva, rajas and tamas, being  divine, cannot be crossed. Those who surrender to me only are the ones that cross  this Maya (Gita, 7:14); the individual self, of the character described above, knows no  emancipation from this bondage, of the nature of association with physical forms  characterized by the various qualities which has been brought about by karma, except by  surrender to the Supreme. The Shruti also says, ‘There is no other way for this goal  (Pu.Suk. 17)’. 
2.   ‘By me, of the imperceptible form, is all this permeated. All beings have their being in  me and I do not have my being in them. And again, they do not have their being in me. See  this transcendent power of mine, the power of Ishvara (Gita, 9:4-5)’; as the Supreme has  all powers, its control of the cosmos is surpassingly wondrous. The text says, ‘Controlling  all this universe by a mere part of myself I abide (Gita, 10:42)’. The meaning of this is, ‘I  have entered this infinitely variegated and wondrous universe as its inner self by an  infinitesimal part of myself and control all by mere will. In this form I abide, possessed of  infinite and immense glory, an ocean of exalted attributes and an unsurpassed wonder’. 
3.   The mystery of the Divine is further praised, ‘Who can comprehend that  incomprehensible form of Brahman, which being one, is many and being many, is one’.  God is one as the ruler of the universe. But he enters into all spiritual and physical entities  as their inner self, appropriates them as his wondrous forms and modes and causes  wondrous activities. Thus he flourishes in a plurality of forms. Having thus entered into  this wondrous and manifold universe by an infinitesimal part of himself as its inner soul  and controlling it all, though God stands in a plurality of forms, he remains absolutely one,  the repository of infinite and surpassingly perfect attributes, the Lord of lords, the highest  Brahman, the supreme Person, Narayana; Narayana, who is the supreme marvel, who is  like the blue cloud, with eyes wide and pure like the petals of lotus, and with the radiance  of a thousand suns. He dwells in the transcendent realm as spoken of in the Vedic  passages, ‘Who knows him as treasured in the cavern of the highest sky (Tai. 1, 4)’ and ‘In  that imperishable and highest sky’. 
4.   No entity, other than Brahman, endowed with one type of nature, capable of  performing one type of activity and having one particular type of form, can possess  another type of form, another type of nature and another type of capacity. Only the  supreme Brahman, even though it is a single reality, has all natures and capacities, being  unique and altogether different from every other entity. Though it is one only, it has  wondrous, infinite and manifold forms, and again by reason of its infinite, unlimited and  mysterious powers it is of one form. This is not a self-contradiction in Brahman. Because it  is similar to others, in being an entity, we ought not to regard it a self-contradiction in  Brahman to have diversity of forms, powers and qualities as well as unity of being. 
5.   This has been stated by Bhagavan Parashara in the following verses: ‘O the best of  ascetics! the powers of all beings, incomprehensible to thought, like the power of creation,  belong to Brahman. All such powers belong to it, even as heat belongs to fire (Vi. Pu.  1:3:2-3)’. The significance of the statement is this: Among the varied kinds of beings  like fire and water, a power observed in one cannot be inferred as belonging to another  category of things. The powers like heat and light, though not observed in water, do belong  to fire, a substance of a different kind. Even so, Brahman which is unique and different  from all other entities in kind, ought not to be conceived as limited in its powers, forms36 
and qualities on the misapplied principle of analogy. Therefore, Brahman has wondrously  manifold and infinite powers. (Akrura exclaims), ‘O Krishna, I am united with thee,  the infinite Spirit, whose form this immensely marvellous universe is, and who in thyself  art the grandest marvel (Vi. Pu. 5:19:7)’. This insight is the outcome of a devoted  application to the study of the manifold and boundless Shrutis and the commentaries  thereon adopted by the great teachers. 
1.   There are several types of Shruti passages speaking of the creation and dissolution of  the universe by Brahman, proceeding in rigorous order, involving a multitude of  entities, subject to infinite modifications. All these matters relating to creation and  dissolution are beyond the bounds of other sources of knowledge. 
2.   There is one group of texts which describes Brahman as attributeless and as of the  nature of knowledge like the following: ‘Free from imperfection’, ‘free from  evil’, ‘Knowledge’, ‘bliss’, ‘changeless’, ‘partless’, ‘actionless’, ‘full of peace’ and  ‘attributeless’. 
3.   There is another type of texts which denies plurality. The following serve as  illustrations: ‘There is no plurality here. He goes from death to death, who sees  plurality here (Brh. Ar. 4:4:19)’; ‘Where everything becomes the atman, there, what is  there to be seen? And by what means can anything be seen? There, what is there to be  known? And by what means can anything be known? (Brh. Ar. 4:5:15)’. 
4.   There is another class of Shrutis which denies of Brahman everything that is cognised  as evil in the world and predicates of it infinite and surpassing auspicious attributes,  omniscience, omnipotence, the authorship of the differentiations of all names and forms  and the attribute of being the support of all. They are exemplified by the following: ‘He,  who knows all, who cognises all and whose penance consists of knowledge (Mu. 1:1:9)’;  ‘The intelligent one created all forms, gave names and remained proclaiming them all  (Pu.Suk., 16)’; ‘From this luminous Person are all moments born (M.B. 2:5)’; ‘He is free  from sin, old age, death, sorrow, hunger, and thirst. He has all desires fulfilled and his will  comes true (Chan. 8:8:1)’. 
5.   There is, again, another variety of Shruti: ‘All this is indeed Brahman, as all arises  from, subsists in and dissolves into Brahman (Chan. 6:14:1)’: ‘All this is ensouled by this  (Chan. 6:7:7)’; ‘Being one he is spread manifold (Tait. Ar.. 6:3)’. These describe the world  created by Brahman in all its multiplicity and at the same time affirm its oneness. 
6.   The following texts maintain that Brahman is distinct from all, that all else is  subordinate to him, while he is their supreme ruler and that all entities are subsidiary  to him, while he is their master: ‘Knowing the self and the directing one as different (Sve.  1;12)’; ‘Comprehending the experiencer, the experienced and the directing one (Sve.  1;25)’; ‘The Lord of creatures desired, “Let me bring forth creatures”;’ ‘The master of the  universe, the Lord of souls, ever-existent, the holy and the imperishable (M.B. 11);’ 
‘Him, who is the great Sovereign of sovereigns, the ultimate God of gods (Sve. 6:13);’ ‘He  in whose control everything is, and who rules all (Brh. Ar. 6:4:22).’ 
1.   Lastly, there are Shruti texts like the following which declare that Brahman is the self  of all other entities and that all of them constitute his body: “Having entered within, he  rules and is the soul of all (Tait. Ar.. 3:29)’ ‘He is your Atman, the inner controller  immortal (Brh. Ar. 5:7:3);’ ‘He, whose body the earth is, whose body the waters are,  whose body fire is, whose body the unmanifest is, whose body the imperishable is, whose 
37 
body death is, whose body the individual self is (Su. 7)’. The interpretation of the  various types of texts must be such that they are not made to contradict among themselves  in their contents; and not a single text should be so interpreted as to be divested of its  primary and fundamental significance. Such is the exposition developed herein. 
1.   The texts of the Shruti declaring ‘changelessness’ are taken in their primary import,  because modification in the substantive nature of Brahman has been denied.  The propositions affirming Brahman to be ‘attributeless’ are given a determinate import as  negating of Brahman the properties pertaining to matter and imperfections. The texts  denying plurality, have their affirmations supported and sustained, through the conception  that the whole universe, formed of sentient and non-sentient entities, constitutes the body  and mode of Brahman and that Brahman alone exists as the self of all and has everything  as its mode. The passages speaking of Brahman ‘as different from all, as the Lord, as the  supreme ruler, as the ocean of perfections, as having all desires fulfilled and as having a  will that comes true’ have been sustained by the admission of the affirmed attributes  as ultimately real. The texts describing Brahman as sheer ‘knowledge’ and ‘bliss’ have  their principal import thoroughly maintained. The supreme Brahman, the unique, the  abode of all excellences, the ruler of all, the principal entity to which all are subsidiary, the  supporting ground of all, the ground of creation, maintenance and destruction, the faultless  and the immutable and the soul of all — has as its defining attribute, knowledge of the  form of bliss, antithetical to all impurity; and being self-luminous, its substantive  nature also is knowledge itself. This is the significance of the declarations that Brahman is  sheer bliss and knowledge. The passages proclaiming unity have a well-established  significance. Through the conception of Brahman and the world as constituting soul and  body, identification, urged by co-ordinate predication, is brought out in the primary  manner and thus the concept of ultimate unity is made to stand secure. 
2.   It may be asked, ‘What is your final position? Do you uphold unity or plurality or  both unity and plurality? Which of these three forms the substance of the Vedanta on your  interpretation?’ We reply that we uphold all the three as they are all affirmed in the Veda.  We uphold unity because Brahman alone exists, with all other entities as its modes. We  uphold both unity and plurality, as the one Brahman itself, has all the spiritual and physical  substances as its modes and thus exists qualified by a plurality. We uphold plurality as the  three categories, sentient selves and non- sentient existents and the supremo Lord, are  mutually distinct in their substantive nature and attributes and there is no mutual  transposition of their characteristics. 
3.   ‘But’, it may be said in objection, ‘Only knowledge of unity is put forward as the  means of attaining the summum bonum, the final liberation, in the passages, “That thou  art, Svetaketu” and “Only as long as he is not liberated”. The position is not as you  construe it. Here is a passage speaking of this matter, ‘Knowing the self and the directing  power as distinct, and thereby favoured by that power be attains immortality (Sve. 1;12)’.  This is the meaning of the passage: Having known the self and the inner controller as  distinct and by virtue of this knowledge of distinction, he attains immortality, graciously  favoured by the supreme Self. Thus the direct means for the achievement of immortality is  laid down to be the understanding of the difference between the individual self and the  supreme controller. 
4.   (Objection): As this passage is in conflict with the monistic passages, it must be  construed as not giving us the knowledge of reality but only as inculcating the method of  attaining the phenomenal Brahman qualified by attributes.
38 
(Reply): If this view be urged, we ask, ‘Why should not the contrary be the proper course  of interpretation, especially in view of fact that the direct way leading to immortality is  explicitly laid down in this passage ?’ 
1.   The proper approach to the whole situation would be to discern and extract a  reconciling principle, when there are two (seemingly) contradictory pronouncements,  possessing equal authority as sacred texts. If we are asked how our understanding of the  texts establishes reconciliation, we reply thus: We maintain in the first place, that  Brahman is the inner ruler and of this inner ruler, the individual self is a mode, being his  body. Thus by the term ‘thou’ only the highest Brahman, characterized by the individual  self as his mode is designated and denoted. This truth must be apprehended as such without  any qualification. This is the meaning of the text ‘That thou art’. In the second place,  the highest Self is other than the individual self, in which the Supreme abides as the inmost  self. As the Supreme is devoid of all imperfections and is characterized by countless  and surpassing attributes of excellence, this ‘otherness’ in relation to the individual self is a  verity. That this difference must be contemplated upon is the purport of the second  passage. This has been set forth already many times. 
2.   The distinctions, whose knowledge is inculcated, are outlined in the passage,  ‘Comprehending the experiencer, the objects of experience and the directing power, all  this threefold Brahman is expounded (Sve. 1;12)’. All objects of experience are insentient,  real and are always subject to modification. These qualities of physical nature must  be discriminated. The individual self who enjoys and suffers has pure and unlimited  knowledge and bliss as his inherent character. But his inherent character of knowledge  and bliss sometimes expands and sometimes contracts in a multiplicity of ways  conditioned by nescience, taking shape as the stream of beginningless karma.  Consequently there is association with physical nature, described previously as ‘the  objects of experience’. The emancipation of the individual self is effected by the  meditation on the supreme Self. These are the distinctive facts concerning the individual  self. Brahman exists as the inner ruler of the non-sentient realm of ‘the objects of  experience’ and of the individual self, the ‘experiencer’, both possessing the aforesaid  characteristics. Brahman exists in its own intrinsic form, radiant with its own infinite  perfections. These three forms of its existence are to be understood. The passage in  question inculcates discriminating knowledge of the three entities and the three forms in  which Brahman exists. 
3.   The great ancient teachers dealing with the meditation on ‘sat’ (advocated in the  Chandogya Upanishad), in relation to which meditation, the dictum ‘That thou art’ occurs,  have maintained in their commentaries that Brahman, the subject-matter of the meditation  is characterized by excellences of attributes and that the fruit of that meditation is the  attainment of Brahman as abounding in attributes. The Vakyakara says, ‘It is as qualified  by attributes that Brahman is attained, for the meditation on Brahman is also as qualified’.  Dramidacarya, who advocated choice of meditations, explains the principle as follows:  ‘The seeker meditating on ‘sat’ does not pursue meditatively the attributes to the exclusion  of the Deity. But still he meditates on the Deity as inclusive of attributes and as such, the  Deity attained is also possessed of attributes’. ‘The seeker meditating on “sat” ‘ means one  who is devoted to the meditation prescribed and elaborated in the section of  Chandogya known as sadvidya. ‘Does not pursue meditatively the attributes to the  exclusion of the Deity’ means that even though the devotee of the meditation on ‘sat’ does  not dwell on the auspicious qualities like ‘freedom from sin’ apart from the Deity unlike  the devotee of the meditation on dahara’ (i.e., subtle ethereal space in the heart), he does  meditate on the Deity as inclusive of attributes. All the glorious attributes of Brahman are 
39 
inherent in its substantive nature and even when only some inherent and unique attributes,  like being the cause of the world, are taken up for meditation along with the Deity, in  reality, the Deity is meditated upon as characterized by all the inherent excellences of  attributes. Therefore the Brahman to be reached by this meditation on sat’ also, is Brahman  with attributes. Therefore either of these two types of meditation, sadvidya or daharavidya 
can be chosen for cultivation.

2.   (Objection): The following criticism may be raised: Now, you have held that all  creatures are governed by the Supreme and that the Supreme is the inner controller of all.  If that is the case, there appears to be no one to whom the scriptural injunctions and  prohibitions could apply. Only be, who is capable of doing or abstaining from actions  by initiative of his own intelligence, can be subject to the injunction of ‘ought’ and to the  prohibition of ‘ought not’. Such a personality is ruled out in your scheme. The  supreme Self is held to be the directing spirit in relation to all activity and is said to cause  action to be done. Such is the way in which his cosmic control is conceived. Further,  sacred texts say, ‘He gets good actions done by those whom he wants to lift up and gets  evil actions done by those whom he wants to cast down (Kau. 3;9)’. By thus getting  actions, good and bad, performed the godhead would be responsible for cruelty. 
3.   (Reply): We answer this criticism as follows: The supreme Being endows all sentient  beings with the power of thought and power of action. Thus the general equipment needed  for the performance as well as the non- performance of actions is furnished by him. Then  in order to manage the situation, he becomes the support and basis of all, enters into all  beings and governs from within by his approbation of acts of individual will. He abides as  the fundamental Sheshin’ of all, all the individuals being subsidiary to him. The individual,  thus equipped with all the requisite powers and facilities, endowed with the power of  initiative, engages in actions and abstinence from action by his own spontaneity of will.  The Supreme Being, witnessing his activity, remains unconcerned. Thus the whole  situation is intelligible. God’s causing good and bad actions to be performed is not  universal in relation to all moral agents. It is a situation that obtains in certain determinate  circumstances. If an individual by himself is engaged in the pursuit of what is most in  accordance with the will of God, God being pleased with him, confers upon him  spontaneously a holy disposition of will and intellect and actuates him in the right and holy  direction. If, on the other hand, an individual is pursuing what is most contrary to the  divine will, the Lord gives him evil intellect and will and actuates him to proceed along  evil lines. 
4.   The Lord has stated these principles: ‘To those, who seek union with me always, and  are devoted to me, I give with love, the power of wisdom, by which they attain unto me.  And 1, dwelling in their hearts, am moved by compassion and therefore destroy their  darkness of soul born of ignorance by lighting the luminous lamp of their knowledge. But I  cast again and again into unholy births, into samsara, those who hate me, who are hard 
hearted, who are wicked and are the worst of men (Gita, 10:10-11 & 16:19)’. 
1.   Now this supreme Brahman, the supreme Person is to be attained. The pathway  through which he is to be attained is as follows: By an accumulation of the greatest merit,  the sins of the past gathered through all past lives, are destroyed. A person, whose sins are  thus destroyed through great merit, seeks refuge at the feet of the supreme Person. Such  self-surrender begets an inclination towards Mm. Then the aspirant acquires knowledge of  reality from the scriptures aided by the instruction of holy teachers. Then by a steady effort 
40 
he develops in an ever increasing measure the qualities of soul, like the control of the  mind, the control of senses, austerity, purity, forgiveness,  straightforwardness, discrimination as to what is to be feared and not feared, mercy and  non-violence. He is devoted to the performance of the nitya and naimittika duties  pertaining to his varna and ashrama, and avoids actions prohibited, such a course  of conduct being conceived as the worship of the supreme Person. He offers his all and his  very self at the lotus-like feet of the supreme Person. Actuated by loving devotion to him,  he offers perpetual praise and obeisance, engages in perpetual remembrance of him, bows  down before him in adoration perpetually, exerts himself always in the god ward direction,  always sings his glories, always listens to the exalted accounts of his perfections, speaks  perpetually of those perfections, meditates upon him continuously, ceaselessly worships  him and dedicates himself once for all to him. The supreme Person, who is overflowing  with compassion, being pleased with such love, showers his grace on the aspirant, which  destroys all his inner darkness. Bhakti develops in such a devotee towards the supreme  Person, which is valued for its own sake, which is uninterrupted, which is an  absolute delight in itself and which is meditation that has taken on the character of the most  vivid and immediate vision. Through such Bhakti is the Supreme attained. 
1.   The great teacher, Bhagavan Yamunacarya says, ‘He is attainable through the  pathway of Bhakti, which is an end in itself and ceaseless and succeeds the double training  of the inward parts (Siddhi-traya)’. ‘The double training of the inward parts’ means the  culture of the inner sense by the discipline of jñana and karma. The Shruti also says, ‘One  who knows vidya and avidya together, crosses death through avidya! and attains  immortality through vidya (Isa. 11)’. Here the word avidya signifies what is other than  vidya, namely, the duties pertaining to one’s station in life, like varna and ashrama. By the  term vidya is meant meditation that has developed into Bhakti. It has been said,  ‘Resting on knowledge, he performed many sacrifices, with a view to overcoming death by  means of avidya! and reach the vidya of Brahman (Vi. Pu. 6:6:12)’. Further the Shruti say:  ‘Knowing him, one becomes immortal here. There is no other way to that goal (Pu.Suk.  17);’ ‘Those who know this one, become immortal (M.B. 1, 10);’ ‘One who knows  Brahman, attains the Highest (Tai. 11, 1);’ ‘He who knows Brahman, becomes Brahman  (Mu. 3:2:9).’ In all these and similar cases the term ‘Knowledge’ (vedana) signifies  meditation (dhyana). Knowledge is to be so understood because coherence with such texts  as ‘He is to be meditated upon (Brh. 6:5: 6)’ must be maintained. 
2.   That meditation is further defined by the text, ‘This atman is not attained by the  reflection on the sacred texts, by the exercise of intelligence or by excessive learning of the  texts. By him, whom this atman chooses, is he attained. To such a chosen one, the atman  reveals his form’. (Mu. 3:2:3 & Ka. 1:2:22)’. This determination of the character of  meditation lays down that only meditation of the form of Bhakti leads to the attainment of  Brahman and the efficiency of mere meditation is denied by the phrase, ‘Not by the  exercise of intelligence’. To explain: When the seeker after emancipation, established in  the knowledge prescribed in the Vedanta of the form of meditation, develops  within himself all-absorbing and all-surpassing love for that meditation itself, just at that  very point of time is the supreme Person attained by him. The words of the Lord are to  this effect: ‘That supreme Purusha, Partha, is attainable by undivided Bhakti (Gita, 8;22);’  ‘1, of this nature, Arjuna, am such that by undivided Bhakti one is able to understand me,  to have a vision of me and to merge into me (Gita, 11:54);’ ‘By Bhakti one truly  understands me, as to what I am and the full expanse of my being. Then, by the same  means, knowing me he enters into me (Gita, 18:53)’. Here the sentence ‘Then, by the same  means, knowing me, he enters into me’ means that a person after understanding  through Bhakti, enters into the Supreme through Bhakti itself. Bhakti is that particular kind41 
of knowledge, which is a state that elicits absolute love towards itself, which is an end in  itself, and eliminates the desire for everything else. One blessed with such Bhakti attains  the fitness to be chosen by the supreme Self. By him is the Supreme attained. This is the  significance of the Shruti under discussion. 
1.   This particular kind of knowledge of the nature of the highest Bhakti, is brought about  only by Bhakti yoga already delineated, which grows by continuous practice, and is  assisted by karma which follows jñana. Bhagavan Parashara says, ‘A man, who performs  the duties of his varna and ashrama, can worship the supreme Person, Vishnu; no  other way pleases him (Vi. Pu. 2:8:9)’. The highest Brahman, the supreme Person,  incarnated on earth for the uplift of the whole world, has himself ordained, ‘Listen, how a  man devoted to his own duties can attain realization. By worshipping the Lord, from whom  proceed all beings and by whom all this is pervaded, through such duties as are  appropriate to oneself, one attains realization (Gita, 18:45-46)’. Thus the Supreme is  attainable only through Bhakti, which is the fruition of the spiritual development  described. 
2.   The philosophical approach developed herein is one that has been presented by the  Vedas, whose import has been clearly revealed by the ancient commentaries on the  Vedas and Vedanta and has been unanimously adopted by the great ones like Bhagavan  Bodhayana, Tanka, Dramida, Guhadeva, Kapardin and Bharuci. By this, the extra 
Vedic schools of thought like those of Carvaka, Sakya, Aulukya, Aksapada, Ksapanaka,  Kapila and Patanjali along with the schools of some followers of the Vedas whose vision is  perverted, are refuted. 
1.   That even the followers of the Vedas, who take a wrong view of things, are to be  judged on a footing of equality with the non-Vedic thinkers has been laid down by Manu  himself. He says, ‘The smritis that are non-Vedic and the views that are perverse, are  futile, being established in tamas (XII, 96)’. Only those who have sattva 
uncontaminated by rajas and tamas as their innate propensity have a taste for the Vedas  and an understanding of the real contents of the Vedas. Matsya-Purana accords with this  proposition: ‘There are four categories — the mixed, the sattvik, the rajasik and the  tamasik’. Some epochs of Brahma are mixed, some are dominantly sattvika, some are  dominantly rajasik and some dominantly tamas. After this classification of epochs, it  is stated that Brahma dominated by the predominant quality of each epoch, proclaims the  greatness of principles that correspond in quality to the epoch in question and to his own  dominant propensity in that epoch. ‘in the various Puranas produced in the past by Brahma,  deities have been praised corresponding to the dominant qualities of the epoch of  production (Matsya)’. The principle is more specifically laid down (in the following  verses): ‘In the epochs of tamas the greatness of Agni and Shiva is praised. In the epochs  of rajas the greater greatness of Brahma is praised (Matsya. LIII, 68);’ ‘Then in the epochs  of sattva the still greater greatness of Hari is praised. Those who reach realization in them  attain the highest goal (Matsya. LIII, 67);’ ‘In the mixed epochs the greatness of Sarasvati  and manes is praised (Matsya. LIII, 69).’ 
1.   The idea of the foregoing is this: Brahma is the first individual self (in the realm of  samsara). Therefore even in him, some days sattva, some days rajas, and some days tamas preponderate. The Lord has said, ‘There is no creature either on earth or in heaven among  the gods, which is free from these material properties (Gita, 18:40)’. The Vedic text ‘He,  who first creates Brahma and imparts the Vedas to him (Sve. 6:35) ‘implies that Brahma is  a creature, and is subordinated to the commandments of the scriptures and therefore is an  individual self in bondage. Further, it is to be understood, that in case there is a conflict 
42 
between the Puranas that have been composed by Brahma on the days in which sattva preponderates and the Puranas that have been composed by him on other days, the Puranas  composed on the days of sattva are true and the others in conflict with them and composed  on other days are untrue. This principle of evaluation has been formulated by Brahma,  himself, when established in and devoted to sattva. The effects of the three qualities have  been enumerated and classified by the Lord himself: ‘Sattva originates knowledge, rajas originates covetousness and tamas originates inadvertence, delusion and ignorance (Gita,  14:17);  
“O Partha, do thou understand that buddhi is sattvika, which discerns action and  non-action, what is to be done and what is not to be done, what is to be feared  and what is not to be feared, and bondage and emancipation. That buddhi is  rajas through which dharma and adharma, actions to be done and actions not to  be done are not cognised in the correct manner. That buddhi is tamasa, which  being enveloped in darkness takes adharma for dharma and in general takes  everything, for its exact opposite (Gita, 18:30-32)’.  
The author of each of the Puranas, first of all gathered from Brahma himself all  the materials that should go into the particular Purana and then transmitted that body of  information through his composition. Accordingly it has been stated, ‘I will tell you, as  Brahma, told, in reply to the questions put to him by the great sages like Daksa (Vi. Pu.  1:2:8)’. (This is the governing principle of evaluation in connection with the Puranas). It  may be asked, how we ought to proceed when we are confronted with conflicting passages  of the Vedas, which are not personal compositions. Our reply is that the conflict can be  eliminated by the determination of the total import of the texts, as already demonstrated. 
1.   (Objection): But there appears to be a discrepancy in the purport of the following  texts: ‘Establishing the prana along with the senses on the highest Self, at the end of  the Nada, in the mind, let one meditate on Isana. Let the seeker reflect that all these, these  gods, Brahma, Vishnu, Rudra and Indra, are all subject to birth and so they are not the  cause. But the cause is to be meditated upon. Sambhu, the overlord of all, to whom belongs  universal sovereignty, must be meditated upon in the centre of the akasha (Atharva.);’  
‘He, other than whom there is none that is great, subtle or big, stands firm like  a tree in the heaven and he stands alone. By that Purusha is all this filled. That  which is superior to him (tatah) and is formless and stainless is Bhagavan  Shiva, whose are all the faces, heads and necks, who abides, in all hearts and  who pervades all and has gone into all. Knowing him they attain immortality  while others sink in sorrow. (Sve. 3: 9-11);’  
‘In that darkness, which was neither day nor night, in which there was neither  being nor non-being, only Shiva remained. He is imperishable, is great beyond  the sun, and from him did all the ancient wisdom flow (Sve. 4:18)’.  
But at the same time the Shruti says, as previously propounded, Narayana is the supreme  Brahman (M.B.)’. How can these two sets of texts be free from mutual contradiction? 
1.   (Reply): This is a very trivial issue. The truth may be summed up in these words: The  entire body of the Vedas, amplified by the words of the best of the knowers of the Vedas  and the canons of interpretation, declares that Hari is the cause of the origin etc. of this  universe. To explain: On the authority of the aphorism  
‘That from which the creation etc. of this universe proceed is Brahman (Brh. Ar. 1, 1,  2)’ and the text 
43 
‘That from which all these creatures are born ‘ that in which they all subsist and that into  which they all enter, enquire into that and that is Brahman (Tai. 111, 2)’, we make out that  cause of the creation etc. of the world is Brahman. We have to study it only in the sections  which deal with the subject-matter of creation and dissolution. The text ‘Being only,  without a second (Cha. VI, ii, 1)’ declares that the ultimate cause, described therein as  ‘Being’ is Brahman by virtue of its being the material cause, efficient cause and the inner  controller of the world. The same entity is spoken of in another section and is designated  ‘Brahman’, as ‘All this was Brahman, Brahman only, in the beginning (Brh. Ar. 3:4;10)’.  By this we are made to understand that the principle described as ‘sat’ is Brahman. The  same truth is conveyed in another branch of the text, ‘All this was atman only in the  beginning and nothing else was there (Ai. 1)’. This brings out that atman itself was  described in the other two sections as ‘sat’ and ‘Brahman’. Similarly in another text it is  said, ‘Only Narayana existed, neither Brahma, nor Isana, nor the sky and earth  (Mahopanisad, 1, 1)’. The culminating inference is that Narayana himself has been  described in the other sections by the terms ‘sat’, ‘Brahman’ and ‘atman’ all of which are  applied to the ultimate cause. 
1.   Further, the text commencing with ‘In the centre of the sea the wise men intuit him’,  goes on to say, ‘none grasps him above, none horizontally, none in the centre; none rules  over him. His glory is indeed great. His form does not get sighted. None sees him with his  eyes. He is grasped by the wise with the heart and the mind. Those who know him become  immortal (M.B.)’. Thus his greatness beyond all else is declared and that there can be  anything greater than him is denied by the sentence, ‘None rules over him’. Then the  direction ‘Here the hymn commencing with “Born out of the waters” and eight rks  commencing with “Hiranya- garbha” must be recited’ connects the passages with the hymn  to Purusha. That hymn has as its theme the supreme Purusha. The supreme Purusha is  revealed to be Narayana by the text, ‘The goddess Hri and the goddess Lakshmi are  the two consorts (Pu.Suk. 24)’. 
2.   This truth is elaborately elucidated in the section called Narayana Anuvaka (in Maha narayana-upanishad). It commences with ‘Thousand-headed god’ and proceeds to the text,  ‘He is Brahma, be is Siva, he is Indra, he is Aksara, He is the highest Svarat’. In the  various branches of the scriptures’. purporting to describe the supreme Reality,  these terms, ‘Aksara, Siva, Sambhu, Parabrahman Paramjyoti, Paratattva, Parayana, and  Paramatman’ are applied to that Reality. Now this section applies all those terms to  Narayana on the ground, that the attributes which those terms connote, are all found in  Narayana. It also asserts that all entities other than Narayana depend upon him, are  pervaded, supported and controlled by him, are subsidiary to him in value and have him as  their self. It further treats Brahma and Shiva as equal to Indra and other minor deities and  thus ascribes to them the status of the glory of Narayana. This section aims solely at the  determinate enunciation of the supreme Being. Nothing else is enjoined in it. The other  scriptural sections like the one starting with the sentence ‘The knower of Brahman attains  the Highest (Tai. 11, 1)’ prescribes meditation etc. on the supreme Brahman, enunciated in  this section. 
3.   Therefore the text beginning with ‘Establishing pranas along with the senses on the  highest Self (Atharva)’ etc. inculcates that all effects like prana and the senses must be  drawn back to their fundamental cause, the highest Self and that the same highest Self, the  Lord of all, must be meditated upon. Thus the meditation on Narayana himself, the  supreme Brahman, is prescribed in the text. That he is the sovereign of all is brought out in  the passages, ‘The Master of the universe’ and ‘There is no ruler over him’. Therefore the  injunction, ‘Sambhu, the overlord of all, to whom belongs universal sovereignty, must be 
44 
meditated upon in the centre of the akasha (Atharva.)’ just advocates meditation on  Narayana who is the ultimate cause and is designated ‘Shambhu’. The basis for this  interpretation is that the text opens with the question, ‘On what should one meditate ?’ and  offers the answer, ‘The cause is to be meditated upon’ affirming thereby the unworthiness  of the effects to be made the objects of meditation and the exclusive worthiness of the  cause to be the object of meditation. Now, the section, Narayana-Anuvaka, wholly  devoted to determining the ultimate cause, makes it clear that Narayana is the ultimate 
cause and that he is called Sambhu To put an interpretation on the present passage  inculcating meditation on the cause, contrary to Narayana Anuvaka which specifies  that cause would be wholly unreasonable. 
1.   The sentence ‘That which is superior to him (tatah) (Sve. 3: 10)’ has been construed  as positing an entity higher than the Purusha. That construction is ruled out by the  following consideration of the text. In the text ‘He, other than whom there is none that is  great, subtle or big (Sve. 3: 9)’ the clause ‘other than whom there is none that is  great’. means that there is no principle other than this which has any kind of greatness. In  the same passage, ‘subtlety’ means minuteness and ‘bigness’ means the supremacy over  all. Denial of the subtlety and bigness of everything else means that, as this entity is all  pervading and all-controlling, there is no entity beside it which is either subtle or big. The  clause ‘Other than whom there is none that is subtle or big’ denies the possibility of any  entity other than the Purusha being great and so, nothing can be higher than Purusha. This  consideration rules out the supposition in question of an entity higher than the Purusha.  
2.   Then what is the purport of the passage in question? The discourse runs thus: In the  beginning of the section it is said, ‘Knowing only him, one passes beyond death. There is  no other way (Sve. 6:15)’. The knowledge of the Purusha is stated to be the means for  immortality and nothing else is said to lead to that goal. Then beginning with ‘Other  than whom there is none that is great (Sve. 3: 9)’ and ending with ‘By that Purusha is all  this filled (Sve. 3: 10) the discourse explains the greatness of the Purusha beyond all else.  Then the text ‘Tatah yaduttarataram’ occurs. It means: Because the Reality, the Purusha,  is great beyond all else, therefore (tatah) that same great Purusha, which is formless and  stainless, is such that those who know it become immortal and others sink into sorrow.  Thus knowledge of that Purusha is the road to immortality and nothing else is. The  opening declaration is brought to a reasoned conclusion. On any other interpretation, the  (two) opening propositions would be nullified. And again, as this Purusha is pure, texts  like ‘Eternal Shiva, imperishable (M.B.)’ describe him as Shiva. In the present text also  Shiva signifies the Purusha. In the further sentence, ‘This Purusha is the great Lord, the  initiator of sattva (Sve. 3:12)’ the ground for designating him ‘Shiva’ is stated. On the  same principle other passages like ‘There was no being or non-being, Shiva alone existed  (Sve. 4:18)’ must be explained. 
3.   Again, in this section of the Upanishad, which speaks of the Purusha, as one ‘over  whom no one rules’ meaning that it is impossible even to imagine any other being either as  equal or superior to the Purusha, and as ‘subtler than the subtlest’, he, the Purusha is  further on described as the supreme Godhead as he is denoted by the letter ‘A’ which is the  root of the pranava, which in its turn is the seed of the Vedas, being the foundation as well  as the fruition of the Vedas; and the meditation on him is advocated as dwelling in the  akasha in the centre of the subtle lotus of the heart. 
4.   Its explanation is as follows: The root of all the Vedas is said to be pranava, the sacred  syllable ‘Aum’. The root of pranava is the sacred letter ‘A’. The whole of the Veda, being  the modification of pranava, is resolved into pranava, its cause. Pranava, the modification 
45 
of the letter ‘A’, is resolved into its cause ‘A’. He who is named by that ‘A’ which is the  root of pranava, is the supreme God. The root of all names is ‘A’ and the root of all  entities, that bear those names, is Narayana. This Narayana, who is the root of all entities  named by the expression which is the root of all names, is the supreme God. 
1.   The Lord says, “I am the beginning and the end of the whole universe (Gita, 7: 6)”,  ‘There is nothing else higher apart from Myself (Gita, 7:7)’ and ‘I am the letter “A” among  the letters (Gita, 10: 33)’. The Shruti also lays down, “A” is the designation of Brahman”,  and ‘All speech is “A” ‘. All speech evolves out of ‘A’ and all entities constituting the  subject-matter of all speech evolves out of Brahman. Therefore, as Brahman is affirmed to  be the meaning of ‘A’, Narayana whose name ‘A’ is, is determined to be the Supreme. 
2.   Of that Narayana, transcendent supremacy is predicated in the Narayana-Anuvaka,  commencing with ‘Thousand-headed God’, which anuvaka has as its sole purport the  determinate characterization and exposition of the ultimate reality. The supreme principle  is what is so determined by this section, which has no other function than such  determination. Other sections whose purport is other than this determination, may  designate the ultimate principle in other ways, through other terms. The Sutra-kara, in  the aphorism ‘The instruction is from the standpoint of the Shastra as in the case of  Vamadeva (B.S. 1, 1, 31)’, conveys the decision, that what is named by other names in  sections not devoted to the determination of the supreme principle must be taken as one  with the principle, which is specifically designated and determined in this section with the  sole purport of such specific designation and determination. 
3.   If this ultimate principle is sometimes referred to as Brahma or Siva, it does not prove  that the deities Brahma and Shiva, are the highest reality. That possibility is ruled out in the  section, which equates them with Indra etc. and thus assigns to them status of the glories of  the ultimate principle, Narayana. The exegetical situation is similar to the other, well 
established practice (in Vedanta) of not taking the physical akasha and prana as the highest  principle, just on the ground that some scriptural sections refer to the highest principle as  akasha and prana. 
1.   A further objection is raised by the opponent in connection with the section dealing  with the meditation on Brahman, as seated in the heart: ‘Then in this city of Brahman there  is the mansion of the subtle lotus. In this abides the subtle akasha. What is in that akasha  must be searched out, must be investigated (Chan. 8:1:2)’. Here the term akasha stands for  the material cause of the world and some other specific principle that dwells in it is held  out as the goal of search and investigation. This akasha is said to evolve names and forms  and in the hymn on the Purusha, Purusha is declared to be the architect of names and  forms. In the present section, therefore, a principle, other than the Purusha, the latter  being named akasha here, is represented as the object of meditation. 
2.   Now, this objection could emanate only from those who have not studied the Vedas  and not met seers who have comprehended the Vedas. We judge so because the sacred text  itself answers the objection and also the commentator, Vakyakara. To the question, ‘What  is in that subtle, inner akasha which has to be searched out and investigated? (Chan. 8:1:  2)’ the answer is provided by the sacred text: ‘As extensive as this outer akasha is that 
inner akasha in the heart (Chan. 8:1:3)’. This brings out that the inner akasha by which the  supreme Person is meant is of infinite immensity and is the cause and ground of the  whole universe. Further the statement ‘In it are treasured the desires (Chan. 8:1: 5)’  explains that the eightfold perfection of attributes like freedom from sin, the power of  fulfilling all desires and will, are treasured in that supreme Person named the ‘inner46 
akasha’. Thus, just as the supreme Person is to be meditated upon, the eightfold attributes  of’ the supreme Person are also to be made objects of distinct meditation. When the Shruti  says, ‘What is in that is to be searched out, to be investigated (Chan. 8:1: 1)’, it is  this meditation on the attributes that is commended. Thus all objections are answered by  the sacred text itself. 
1.   The substance of the answer to the question ‘What is in that, which has to be searched  out, to be investigated?’ Is that in Brahman (represented here as the subtle space in the  lotus of the heart) are found existing the perfect attributes like being the creator, the  ground, the controller and the master of the whole world and the freedom from  imperfections. The Vakyakara expresses himself to the same effect: “What is in that”  means the desires’. By desires are meant what are desired. What are desired are the  excellences of attributes, like the absence of imperfection. 
2.   The passage may be summed up in these words: The supreme Brahman which is  designated here as ‘the subtle space’ is that reality, whose play unfolds itself as the  creation, maintenance, and dissolution of the entire cosmos. To that reality belong the  eightfold qualitative perfections like the total impossibility of sin and sorrow. Both these  — the substantive being of Brahman and its glorious perfections — are to be searched out  and investigated. There are concordant texts like the one which says, ‘To those who  understand here the atman and his eternal excellences, will accrue freedom in all the  worlds (Chan. 8:1: 6)’. 
3.   In some passages directing the seeker to meditate upon the cause of the universe  Vishnu, specifically determined as the highest reality in sections meant exclusively for  the specific determination of the highest reality, is himself included and enumerated among  the effects. That inclusion and enumeration among the effects of that ultimate cause itself  is to be understood in terms of the descent of the cause into the realm of the effects, as a  matter of voluntary ingression, in pure sport, for fulfilling its own effects-series and to  accomplish the good of the world. The supreme Lord did become the younger brother of  Indra, thereby fulfilling the realm of the gods. He voluntarily descended to the  mundane world and became the son of Dasaratha, thereby fulfilling the dynasty of the solar  kings. The same Lord took birth in Vasudeva’s household voluntarily for removing the  burden on earth, thereby fulfilling the Lunar Dynasty. In the sections devoted specifically  to the topic of the creation and dissolution of world, Narayana alone is represented as the  ultimate cause, as previously elucidated. 
4.   In the Upanishad called Atharvangiras, Rudra expatiates upon his universal greatness  and glory. That has to be understood as a speech grounded on the fact of Brahman entering  into all beings as their soul. The text itself clarifies the whole position by saying, ‘He  entered the inmost recess’. The law governing the right interpretation of all such texts has  been laid down by the author of the Sutras, ‘The instruction is from the standpoint of the  Shastras as in the case of Vamadeva (1, i, 31)’. 
5.   Even Prahlada proclaims, ‘As the infinite one is all-pervading, I am he, all things arise  out of me and they all dwell In me, the primeval one (Vi. Pu. 1:19:85),. Here the basis for  such a proclamation is given clearly by the clause, ‘As the infinite one is all-pervading’. As  the highest Self pervades all beings, sentient and non-sentient, and as they form his body,  all terms denote him, whose body all these entities are. Therefore the term ‘1’ signifies the  Paramatman of whom the individual self is a mode.
47 
1.   It is for this reason that the Vakyakara holds, ‘One should grasp it as one’s own  atman, for all emanates from it’, and thus advocates the meditation on Brahman as the  ‘ego’. All entities—individual selves and physical forms— both in unmanifested and  manifested states are constitutive of the body of the highest Self. So it is that itself which  exists as cause and effect. He alone is thus embodied in all conditions. The Vakyakara  brings out the reason in the words, ‘For all emanates from it’. The Sutrakara has  formulated the idea in the Sutra, ‘The seekers meditate on him as the self and the scriptures  teach him as the self (4:1:3)’. 
1.53. In the Mahabharata Brahma addressed these words to Rudra: ‘Your inner self, my  inner self, and the inner self of all embodied beings is the supreme Lord,  Narayana (Moksha. 179:4)’. The supreme Lord Narayana exists as the inner self of Rudra,  Brahma and all other embodied beings. And in the same work these further passages are  found: ‘Vishnu is the atman of the blessed Bhava, possessing unlimited energy. He  withstood therefore the touch of that bow-string (Karna. 35: 50).’ Again, these two are the  best of the celestials. They are born of favour and anger. They are shown the way by him  and bring about creation and destruction (Mokhsa. 169:19)’. It means that Narayana,  who dwells in them as their inner soul, shows them the way and thus they, Brahma and  Rudra, become the creator and destroyer respectively. 
1.   Those who posit that the material cause and the efficient cause are different entities,  are outside the pale of the Vedas. They would be flagrantly contradicting the  Sutras framed by the knower of Vedas; as, ‘That from which the origin etc. of the world  proceed (B.S. 1, 1, 2)’ and ‘it is the material cause in accordance with the opening  declaration and the Illustrations advanced (B.S. 1:4: 23)’. All the aggregates of Shruti  passages also would negate that position; such as, ‘Being alone, all this was in the  beginning, one only, without a second (Chan. 6:2:1)’; ‘Brahman is the forest and  Brahman is the tree, out of which they fashioned the earth and the sky. He stood on  Brahman, sustaining the world. (Tai. Brahmana, 2:8:9)’; ‘All moments of time, originated  from the Purusha. with the brilliance of lightning (M.B.)’; ‘No one rules over him, his  fame is indeed great (M.B. )’; ‘There is no plurality here (Brh. Ar. 6:4:19)’; ‘He is the  controller of all, the Lord of all (Brh. Ar. 6:4:22)’; ‘Purusha is all this, whatever is past and  whatever is future. He is the Lord of immortality. There is no other way to the Goal  (Pu.Suk. 2-4)’. 
2.   Passing on to Itihasas (Epics) and Puranas, in the sections relating to the creation and  destruction of the universe, an identical conclusion is reached on the question of the  ultimate godhead. These questions are raised in the Mahabharata: ‘Whence is the creation  of this world of moving and non- moving entities? Whither does it go at dissolution?  Instruct me in this matter O Sire (Moksha. 181:1)’. They are answered by the grandfather,  Bhisma: Narayana, whose form the universe is, is the infinite self, the eternal one (Moksha.  181:12)’ and ‘The sages, the manes, the gods, the great elements, the minerals, and in  short, this whole universe, consisting of moving and non-moving entities originates from 
Narayana (Anu. 229)’. 
1.   The Vishnu-Purana has been unanimously adopted by all the great sages, from the  East, West, North and South, as an all-sufficient authority for the ascertainment of all  righteous conduct and Reality. On the authority of the aphorism, ‘Whence the origin etc. of  this (B.S. 1:1: 2)’, Brahman is understood to be the cause of creation etc. of the  universe. Now, the Purana in question, opens with a clear statement of the question as to  what constitutes the source of the creation etc. of the universe and proceeds to answer,  ‘From Vishnu is all this born (Vi. Pu. 1:1:31)’. All agree on the point that such a procedure 
48 
proves that the work has as its sole purpose the exposition of the specific character of  Brahman. In the same text we have the statement, ‘She, who has been named Prakriti by  me, has both a manifest form and unmanifest form. Both she and the Purusha (individual  self) dissolve in the Paramatman. Paramatman is the supporting ground of all and is the  supreme godhead. He is sung in the Veda, as well as Vedanta, as Vishnu (Vi. Pu. 6:4: 39)’.  In all the Vedas and Upanishads, he is sung as the ultimate cause through all modes of  expression. 
1.   Even as among all the srutis, the Narayana-anuvaka, has as its sole aim the specific  determination of nature of Brahman, Vishnu-Purana is also a work solely devoted to  that particular end. It opens with these questions (Vi. Pu. 1:1: 4-5): ‘O Knower of dharma,  I desire to hear from you how this world was and how it will be in future. By what is this  world filled ? Whence are these moving and non-moving beings? By what is it brought to  dissolution and into what does it dissolve?’ The question in essence is ‘What is Brahman?’  The answer making a decisive declaration of the nature of Brahman follows. ‘The universe  originates from Vishnu and exists in him. He is its maintainer and controller. He is the  world. He is greater than the greatest. He is supreme. He is the Paramatman. He dwells in  the selves. He is beyond all characterizations in terms of form, colour, etc. He is  beyond decay and cessation, beyond modification, increase and characterizations in terms  of forms, colour, etc. He is beyond birth. He can be described only as the ‘Ever-existent’.  He dwells in all and all things dwell in him. Therefore the wise name him ‘Vasudeva’. He  is the supreme Brahman, eternal, unborn, imperishable and undecaying. He is always of  the self-same form, free from evil, and thus pure. He is all this and has both this manifested  and unmanifested as his form. And also he exists as the individual spirit and time (Vi. Pu.  2:1:1-14). He transcends, O Sage, the character of all material elements, all mutations and  all qualities of nature, which are essentially imperfections. He is beyond all obscuration of ignorance. He is the soul of all and by him was spread out whatever is contained in the  universe. He is of the nature of all auspicious attributes. By a tiny fragment of his  power the aggregates of beings are lifted up. He assumes by his own desire a multiplicity  of bodies. Thus he accomplishes the good of the whole world. He is a mass of only  excellences like radiance, power, rulership, omniscience, vigour and strength. He is greater  than the greatest. Not one of the imperfections like affliction ever approach him. He is  the sovereign of the high and low. He is the Lord. He has the sum total of all subtle entities  as his form. The gross universe is also his form. He is of the unmanifested form and  manifested form. He is the Lord of all. He sees all. He knows all. He is all-powerful. He is  the supreme God. That by which this pure, taintless, transcendent, faultless and undivided  and sole reality is cognised, perceived and realized, is the only knowledge. All other  processes of cogitation are mere ignorance (Vi. Pu. 6:5: 83-87)’. Thus the (Vishnu Purana) exhibits itself as meant solely for the declaration of the determinate identity of the  supreme Brahman. 
2.   All other Puranas with other aims must be interpreted consistently with this Purana.  That they have other aims is discerned in the manner of their commencement. Whatever is  found in them, altogether inconsistent with this Purana must be set aside as being of the  nature of tamas. 
3.   (Objection): But in this Purana, the equality in status of the three deities Brahma,  Vishnu and Shiva is put forth. ‘That same Bhagavan Janardana assumes three  names, Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva, by virtue of the three functions of creation,  maintenance and destruction (Vi. Pu. 1:2:66)’. 
(Reply): If this be said, we answer that such is not the case. The unity of Janardana, who is  referred to by the expression ‘the same Janardana’ with the whole universe commencing 
49 
with Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva is asserted here. What was stated previously in the  proposition, ‘He is the world (Vi. Pu. 1:1: 31)’ is expanded thus: ‘The same Lord as creator  creates himself, as Vishnu protects all that is to be protected and as destroyer, he  withdraws into himself (Vi. Pu. 1:2: 67)’. Both the creator and the created, the destroyer  and the destroyed are together taken up and the unity of all with Vishnu is proclaimed. The  creator and the destroyer are treated as of the same status as the created existence and  the objects of destruction, in the matter of being the manifestations of Janardana. When it  is said that Janardana assumes three names and forms as Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva (Vi.  Pu. 1:2:66), because the terms Janardana and Vishnu are synonyms, the Lord, whose  manifestation all things are, is said to enter into the realm of his own manifestations and  become included among his own glories. This is an act of his own choice and constitutes  his own play. 
1.   This Position is further developed: ‘The earth, the waters, fire, the air, the space, all  the senses, the mind and the individual self and in short the world as a whole, is be. He is  the soul of all beings, and the universe is his form, as he is imperishable. The processes  like creation that happen to entities are for his sake. He is the creature and he is the author  of creation. He protects, withdraws and is what is protected. Vishnu, the excellent one, the  beneficent one, the adorable one, is of universal form as he assumes states like that of  Brahma. (Vi. Pu. 1:2: 68-70)’. 
2.   Here the oneness of all with him is asserted. The question would arise as to how he,  free from evil and change and abounding in all auspicious excellences, could be one  with the world which is mixed up with evil. The position is explained in the text itself, ‘He  is the soul of all beings. He has the universe as his form, as he is imperishable (Vi. Pu. 1:2:  68)’ The text first states that the same Vishnu, who is supreme Brahman, the Sovereign of  sovereigns, is the world. Then it adds the reason for that conclusion by saying, ‘He is  the soul of all beings, and the universe is his form, as lie is imperishable’. It means that be  is the soul of all beings, and has the universe as his form, because he is  imperishable. Further on the same truth is stated, ‘All that is the body of Hari (Vi. Pu.  1:22:38)’. The fundamental idea is that though Vishnu, the supreme Brahman is  imperishable, there is nothing contradictory in his being one with the universe in the  sense of having it as his body. The distinctive characteristics of the body and soul remain  unmodified. 
3.   And this supreme Vishnu descends by His own choice into the created world and  becomes one among the dependent creatures like gods, animals and men beginning with  Brahma,. This descent among the creatures on the status of equality with them is for  making himself accessible to them in order to facilitate their coming to him for support.  This conception of avatar has already been expounded. In the sixth chapter of Vishnu 
Purana dealing with question of the proper object of meditation, which should be at once  holy as well as accessible, the whole position is clarified. There it is pointed out that beings  like Brahma are associated with the three inner efforts (i.e., karma-bhavana, brahma bhavana and both) and therefore are subject to karma. It is established there that the  supreme Vasudeva, the highest Brahman, descends in his own form, by his own choice, for  working out the good of the world, into the world of beings like gods and men.  Mahabharata says that his body is not physical, even in incarnations. ‘The body of this  supreme Self is not a structure compounded of physical elements’. 
1.   The Shruti also says, ‘The birthless One takes many births. The wise ones  comprehend his birth (Pu.Suk. 21)’. Brahma and other individual selves, being subject to  karma, are compelled to take birth in physical bodies, Structure compounded of physical 
50 
elements, in accordance with their karma. This is inevitable for them, even if they were to  be unwilling to be reincarnated. But in the case of the Lord, whose will perfectly fulfils  itself, and is the controller of all, there is no evil birth of this nature. On the contrary, by his  own desire, in his own supremely holy form, he takes many births among gods, men, etc.  for the purpose of effecting the good of the world. Though he does not take births other 
than the good, out of the infinity of his auspicious qualities, he takes ‘many births’ i.e.,  multiplicity of births. ‘The wise ones’ i.e. the supremely intelligent ones comprehend  (this). 
1.   The Sutrakara, first of all, declares that Brahman is the material and efficient cause of  the world ]in the aphorisms, ‘That from which the origin etc. of this world proceed (B.S.  1:1: 2)’ and ‘He is the material cause also, in accordance with the opening declaration and  the illustrations advanced B.S., 1:4:23)’. He formulates the prima facie view that there is  some principle transcending and surpassing the highest Brahman, the supreme Person so  defined, in the following aphorism: ‘There is something higher than that; on account of the  designation of bridge, measure, connection and difference (B.S. 3:2:30)’. Then he himself  refutes that view in the following aphorisms: ‘But on account of resemblance (B.S. 3:2:  31)’. ‘It subserves the purpose of thought; as in the case of feet (B.S. 3:2: 32)’, ‘Owing to  difference of place as in the case of light and so on (B.S. 3:2: 33)’, ‘And on account of  possibility (B.S. 3:2: 34),’ ‘Thus, from the denial of anything else (B.S. 3:2: 35),’  ‘The omnipresence (possessed) by that, (understood) from the declaration of extent (B.S.  3:2: 36).’ 
2.   So also in the scripture from Manu we learn as follows: ‘The impeller of darkness  (mula-Prakriti) manifested (Ma. 1, 6);’ ‘Desirous of creating the creatures (Ma. 1, 7);’ ‘He  first created the waters and scattered over them the potency (Ma. 1, 8);’ ‘There Brahma  took birth (Ma. 1, 9).’ The birth of Brahma is thus narrated. That makes it clear that  Brahma, is an individual self. Further on the distinct designations of the supreme Person,  the creator, and of Brahma, the creature projected by him are given: ‘They were his abode  in the beginning. So he is known as “Narayana” (Ma. 1, 10);’ ‘That person, who was  projected by him, is known as “Brahma” in the world (Ma. 1, 11)’. 
3.   Similarly Vishnu-Purana, by maintaining that the gods like Hiranyagarbha, being  associated with the three bhavanas and hence being impure, are not fit to be taken as the  ‘holy supports’ for meditation, works out the conclusion that they are mere individual  selves. 
4.   Another view (concerning the correct interpretation of the Vedas) has been upheld by  some thinkers. Their main contention is this: The whole body of the Vedas consisting of  injunctions, explanations and hymns must be expounded as conveying ideas as to what is  to be done .by way of action. It is impossible to apprehend the meaning of words except in  connection with action. Action springs from the consciousness of something to be  accomplished. Therefore words have only the idea of something to be accomplished as  their meaning. From this it follows that nothing that is an accomplished reality can be  revealed by verbal testimony. 
5.   We reply as follows: That the meaning of words must be grasped only in the context  of sentences including action is not an absolute rule. It is being insisted upon by the  opponent as if it were a royal order. As a matter of fact it is very easy to make out that  words have power of denoting existing entities. Suppose a person tells another person by  means of gesture that the latter must tell Devadatta that ‘the staff is to be found in the inner  apartment’. Accordingly the second person proceeds to Devadatta and communicates to51 
him the message not by gestures but by actual words. A fourth person is witnessing the  whole proceeding from the first gesture-communication of the first person to the second  person and latter’s discharge of his commission. We have to suppose him to be ignorant of  the meaning of the words to start with and he has all along watched the proceeding like a  dumb person. He understands the significance of the gestures of the first man and hears the  words of the second man addressed to Devadatta. He apprehends that the meaning  conveyed through the first person’s gestures is the meaning of the words spoken by the  second, ‘The staff is to be found in the inner apartment’. What is the difficulty in  understanding the existential import of words here ? 
1.   (The way children learn language is this). The child is trained gradually by the parents  and elders by being shown persons and things and by the utterance at the same time of  words like ‘This is father’, ‘This is mother’, ‘This is uncle’, ‘This is a man’, ‘This is the  moon’ and ‘This is a serpent’. This the elders do gradually and frequently.  Afterwards whenever the child hears those words again, its mind recalls the meanings. It  also makes out that things and persons were pointed out and the words were uttered,  because the words are naturally the names of those persons and things, especially as there  is no other possible relation between those words and things and as no particular  convention is known to have been made by any individual to that effect. Thus gradually  realizing and again receiving training from elders, it learns the meaning of all words. It  itself begins to use language. It is thus that words acquire their determinate denotations,  and groups of words come to represent particular relations of facts. Thus the regulation that  all words acquire meaning in the context of action and imperatives has no foundation. 
2.   Therefore, as language is quite capable of conveying information about accomplished  facts, all the texts of the Upanishads impart knowledge about Brahman, the cause of the  universe and the repository of all excellences, as previously interpreted. 
3.   Further, let us even admit that all words convey ideas of what is to be accomplished.  Vedanta texts inculcate action in the form of meditation and actually teach all else in  enunciation of what accrues as a result of such meditation to persons on whom the  injunction to meditate is imposed as an aid to meditations to be performed. This is so in  the case of the injunction to sacrifice, which injunction is coupled with the information  concerning heaven as an abode free from sorrow. This is so in the case of the injunction of  night- sacrifice, to which is added the positive information about the great status that  accrues to the performer of the said sacrifice. The prohibition of threatening a Brahmin  is conveyed along with the definite positive information about the means-and-end  relationship subsisting between the non- observance of that prohibition and the imposition  of the penalty of a fine of one hundred gold pieces. 
4.   To explain: in the text, ‘One who knows Brahman attains the Highest (Tai. 1)’ the  attainment of Brahman is promised as the fruition, accruing to one who fulfils  the injunction to meditate on Brahman. It means that one who is desirous of the Highest,  must seek to know Brahman. Brahman is presented here as that which is to be attained. Its  nature and characteristics are all described existentially, as supplementary to the action of  meditation enjoined. Included in that body of existential knowledge, are the truths that  Brahman is the creator of the world, the destroyer of it, the ground of the world, the inner  soul of it and all the other truths both previously mentioned and unmentioned. Thus even  as subsidiary to the imperative prescribing meditation, all the existential propositions of the  Vedanta, retain validity and significance. Therefore, the contents of texts, be they hymns or  explanations, get, established as subsidiary to injunctions provided they are special  (apurva) to them and are free from contradiction.
52 
1.   The commentary of Dramida concurs with this standpoint: Commencing with the  reference to the Shruti, ‘The debt is born’, it states, ‘Though the sentence is a praise of  sacrificial offering it cannot praise, if false’. The meaning of the comment is this: All the  explanatory (i.e., laudatory) portions of the Vedas praise the virtues of the sacrifices, with  the full complement of their limbs, the sacrifices being acts of worship offered to gods.  They also praise the virtues of the gods so worshipped. The virtues praised are such that  they are not open to ordinary means of knowledge. The explanations praise the virtues of  the sacrifices and gods a thousandfold. The purpose of such praise is to create the idea of  the worthiness of the religious action prescribed. If the virtues extolled do not actually  exist, the idea of the worthiness of the said action will not ensue. So the explanatory  passages, if they have to succeed in creating the idea of the worthiness of the actions  prescribed, must, of necessity, affirm and teach the reality of the virtues praised. On  these lines the truth of all hymns and laudatory explanations gets proved. 
2.   Now, those who hold. that the meaning of words lies in what ought to be done must  surely offer a definition of ‘What ought to be done’. You may define that which is to be  accomplished as ‘What follows an act and is aimed at by it’. In that case we ask for the  meaning of ‘being aimed at’. You may add, ‘That for the sake of which the act is  undertaken is the meaning of being aimed at by the action’. Then what is the meaning of  ‘being that for the sake of which an act is undertaken’, the act being something a man  does? You may further reply by saying, ‘That is being aimed at by an act, for the sake of  the attainment of which an agent performs an act’. Then on that clarification, ‘to be aimed  at by an act’ means precisely ‘to be desired’. 
3.   You may develop your explanation this way: ‘What is desired has two forms. In the  first place, it is an object of desire. In the second place, it is what prompts effort on the part  of the agent. This latter is the meaning of “being aimed at by an act”.’ Now we say, that  this labour of explanation, proceeding, as it does from an undue attachment to your own  theory, is Indeed futile. Our argument is this: By this property of ‘prompting effort’ can  be meant only ‘the impossibility of what is conceived as an object of desire coming into  existence, without the agent’s effort to bring it about’. It is this consciousness (of the  unattainability of an object of desire without one’s own exertion) that starts all action.  Those who know the truth on this matter describe the process as follows: After the  origination of desire, if the agent understands that the object of desire cannot come  into existence without his own volitional effort, he develops the desire to act. Then the man  acts. Therefore, there is no meaning in anything being aimed at by an act, other than this  one of the absolute dependence of the emergence into existence of an object of desire on  the effort of the agent. 
4.   A further attempt at the clarification of ‘being aimed at by action’ maybe made. ‘An  object is desired because it is agreeable. To be agreeable is to be aimed at by action’. We  dismiss the explanation. Pleasure is what is agreeable. Pain is what is disagreeable.  Therefore nothing other than pleasure can be agreeable. You may object by saying that  the removal of pain, which removal is different from pleasure, is also found to be  agreeable. It is not so, we reply. That which is agreeable to the self is pleasure. That which  is disagreeable is pain. This is the difference between pleasure and pain. Pleasure which is  agreeable to the self, comes to be desired. Pain which is disagreeable to the self, comes to  be disliked. Therefore, as the conjunction with pain is unendurable, its elimination also  comes to be desired. Therefore, as there is similarity in being desired, the elimination of  pain is also wrongly conceived as agreeable.
53 
1.   To explain: Man, enmeshed in matter, experiences three states, that of conjunction  with the agreeable, conjunction with the disagreeable and that of existence in his own  natural condition. Therefore, the elimination of the conjunction with the agreeable and that  of the conjunction with the disagreeable would be the self’s natural state. Therefore, if  there is conjunction with the disagreeable, the elimination of that conjunction, even though  it is merely a natural state, becomes an object of desire. Since there is similarity by virtue  of being an object of desire, this elimination of the conjunction with pain is wrongly taken  to be agreeable. Therefore, as to be agreeable is to be a pleasure, honest thinkers consider  the view that the obligation is agreeable in nature as ridiculous. 
2.   Further, the obligation is considered an obligation and as abiding and transcendent  precisely on the ground that it brings into being an object of desire. In the injunction,  ‘Let one, desirous of heaven, perform a sacrifice (Ya. 2:1:5)’, 6 the import transcends the  mere action, because it is determined to be the means of attaining heaven on account of the  syntactically juxtaposed expression ‘desirous of heaven’. It is not right to maintain, as is  done by the opponent, that in the injunction ‘Let him sacrifice’, the element that gets  first apprehended in an independent manner by the person to whom the injunction is  addressed as the matter of intrinsic importance, is the element of obligation that he  should sacrifice and that, afterwards, as a derivative thought, the idea of its being  conducive to the attainment of heaven is brought in for purposes of causing the fulfilment  of the obligation, as the words referring to the desire for heaven are juxtaposed. This  account of the injunctive proposition is not right; as a matter of fact, when the agent hears  the verb “sacrifice’ the action that is the meaning of the verb-root presents itself as one that  a person can perform. On account of the juxtaposition of the phrase referring to desire  for heaven, something over and above just that meaning of the verb-root, as constituting an  obligation, permanent and transcendent, presents itself to the mind of the person to whom  the injunction is addressed. All that apprehension of the obligatoriness of the action  proposed and so on follows definitely from the idea that its observance is the means to the  attainment of heaven. The common understanding that the potential form of the verb etc.  enjoin an obligation whose fulfilment is a means to the attainment of heaven, and which  obligation in its inherent nature is interwoven with the words ‘desirous of heaven’ in  meaning is simply rejected without any basis by the opponent’s explanation. 
3.   To explain: Each word presents its meaning as fit to be connected with the meanings  of the other words of the sentence in which it is used. This gets understood immediately  after hearing the sentence which is a combination of words whose meanings form one  inter-related system of meanings. Now, in the present case, this fitness of the meaning of  the verb ‘sacrifice’ to enter into relationship with the meanings of other words lies in the  sacrifice being instrumental to the attainment of heaven. Therefore, just as mere action is  superseded and we have ,in obligation instead, the independence and intrinsic nature of the  meaning of the verb ‘sacrifice’ must also be abandoned in view of the contradiction  resulting otherwise. This is the reason why, in the expression ‘Village on the Ganga’, the  term. Ganga must be so understood as to mean something on which there can be a village.  Just because, to start with, the term ‘Ganga’, means the river Ganga, the meaning of the  term ‘Ganga’, in the expression ‘Village on the Ganga’ cannot be water, if the meaning of’  the term is to be fitted into the sense of the whole expression. Even so, here, in the  sentence ‘Let one, desirous of heaven, sacrifice’ even if the verb ‘sacrifice’ recalls mere  obligation or something to be done as soon as heard as an independent non-instrumental  element, when the total and integrated import of the proposition is apprehended, the  obligation cannot remain an unrelated and non-instrumental element.
54 
1.   It is also not true what has been admitted for the sake of argument that on hearing a  term that signifies something to be done, we apprehend that something as an independent  and non-instrumental obligation. At the time of understanding an obligation, actions like  bringing a cow, being troublesome, cannot acquire the character of obligatoriness to the  consciousness of the subject, unless the, action is presented as a means to an object of  desire. Thus the dictum, ‘An obligation is that which is agreeable’ violates  universal understanding. The person who holds that an obligation is agreeable to the person  to whom it is addressed is going against his own personal experience as well. In the case  of the injunction, ‘One, desirous of rain, should sacrifice with kariri’, that obligation,  instrumental to causing rain, can on no account be experienced as agreeable in itself  apart from its declared relationship to rain. Even if in this life, the causation of rain is  uncertain, that very uncertainty constitutes it an obligation (of a transcendent character). In  that latter case, there is clearly no experience of the agreeable, the same as pleasure. Thus  the meaning of ‘being aimed at’ cannot be seen to be anything different from  the attainability through effort and the fact of being desired. 
2.   A new definition of ‘being aimed at by the act’ may be offered as that ‘to which other  things are subsidiary’. If that be the definition, these two expressions ‘being that to which  others are subsidiary’ and ‘that which is subsidiary to another’ need definition. If you  define ‘the subsidiary’ as that which is the correlative of what is to be done and  the principal element as that which is the correlative of the subsidiary, from these  definitions, it is evident that you define the principal element as ‘that which is to be  done’. But it is precisely this factor described as ‘what is to be done’ whose definition is  sought. The subsidiary may be sought to be defined in another way: ‘That which is  invariably subsumed under an effort aiming at a purpose beyond itself is the subsidiary’.  But the question as to what this ‘aiming at a purpose beyond itself’ is, comes up for  consideration. It is in fact this idea of being aimed at as a purpose that is necessitating all  this discussion. ‘To be aimed at as a purpose is to be desired and to be possible.’ That may  be your definition. What is the meaning of being ‘desired’? ‘To be desired’, you may reply,  ‘is to be the purpose of effort’. Now the purpose of effort is the purpose for realizing which  an agent puts forth effort. We have already determined the nature of this purpose, as  meaning an object of’ desire, depending on the effort of the agent to come into being. 
3.   The real and universal definition of Shesha and Sheshin (the subsidiary and the  principal) must be enunciated as follows: That whose nature lies solely in being valued  through a desire to contribute a special excellence to another entity is the Shesha. The other  is the sheshin (i.e., that to which the subsidiary contributes: special excellence). Out of a  desire to produce the fruit of sacrifice, both the sacrifice and the volitional exertion for the  sake of sacrifice, come to be undertaken. The accessories of sacrifice come to be  attended to, out of the desire to accomplish the sacrifice. Similarly, in the case of servants  their nature lies only in being valued on account of the desire to contribute something  special to the master. Similarly all entities, sentient and non-sentient, eternal and non eternal, have as their sole nature, the character of being valued through a desire to make  some special contribution to the Supreme. Hence all entities are described as subsidiary to  him. He is the principal entity, the Lord of all, the Sheshin. The Shruti say, ‘He is the  controller of all, the Lord of all (Brh. Ar. 6:4:22)’, ‘The master of the universe (M.B.)’ etc.  Therefore the definition, “That which is attainable through effort and is the principal is the  meaning of “what is to be accomplished” ‘ is one that can charm only the credulous  followers. 
4.   Moreover, what ground is there for taking words like ‘desirous of heaven’ in a  sentence like ‘He, who is desirous of heaven, should sacrifice’ as qualifying the subject of 
55 
the injunction and not the agent of the sacrifice? In the injunction, the mood etc. of the  verb indicate the agent of the action proposed (who must be specifically characterised by  some term), and the clause. ‘He, who is desirous of heaven’ supplies the required  qualification of the agent. Taking it as a qualification of the subject of injunction and not of  the agent of action is in contradiction to the principles of the science of language. You may  argue, ‘The person with whom heaven is the end, cannot be made the agent of an action,  not instrumental to the securing of heaven’2. We answer, ‘He cannot also be, for the same  reason, made the subject of the injunction’. Therefore it is to be construed decisively that  the sacrifice is a means to the securing of heaven. The scripture connects him with the  sacrifice as the agent, and therefore, we understand that the prescribed action must be the  means for the desired end of securing heaven. When it is said, “One desirous of a meal,  must go to Devadatta’s house”, the man desirous of a meal is brought into connection  with the action of going to Devadatta’s house as the agent of that action, and therefore, we  understand, even if it was not understood before, that going to Devadatta’s house is  the means of securing a meal. Such is the case in the present instance also. 
1.   Further, one who is associated in the injunction with one action, as its agent, should  not be, in interpretation, associated with another action as the agent of the latter. You are  taking the man, spoken of in the sentence as the agent of sacrifice, and making him the  agent of the mental act of accepting the injunction imposed. You can only understand the  subject of injunction as the agent to whom the mental act of accepting an injunction is  presented as the act he has to perform. It has been so explained: ‘He is the subject of an  injunction, who cognises an imperative as pertaining to himself’. If you say that being an  agent of cognition is conducive to being an agent of sacrifice, we urge the following  application of your procedure. If the injunction ‘Let Devadatta cook’ is heard, Devadatta  is associated in the sentence with cooking as its agent. If Devadatta goes somewhere for  purposes of cooking, that going is conducive to his cooking. Therefore, the  sentence enjoins upon Devadatta the action of going. The unreasonableness of such  construction is evident. 
2.   Further, what makes you resort to an unseen potency (apurva), an abiding entity,  supposed to be designated by the potential mood of the verbs in the injunctive  propositions? If it be said, ‘Otherwise the juxtaposed phrase “desirous of heaven” would  lose all meaning’, we ask, ‘What is the difficulty that makes it lose all meaning?’ 
(Objection): The man desirous of heaven is a person, the attainment of heaven by whom is  the end desired. This attainment is an event that has to take place in future, at a point of  time other than the present point of time. Action of the form of sacrifice etc. is an  instantaneously perishing phenomenon. Such a perishing event of the present cannot bring  about the attainment of heaven at a future point of time. 
(Reply): If this be said, we answer, this is an impossibility that could strike only those who  have not had even the faintest idea of the philosophy of the Vedas. Those who understand  the Vedas maintain that the supreme Lord, Bhagavan Narayana, being worshipped through  the various religious performances, rewards the worshippers with the objects they desire. 
1.   So says the, teacher, Dramida, foremost among the knowers of the Veda: ‘Desirous of  fruits, they seek to please (the supreme) Atman. He being pleased, confers the fruits. This   
2 Though most of the printed editions have the reading svarga-sadhana, we have adopted the reading  ‘asvarga-sadhana based upon the commentary of Sudarshanasuri which reads as follows svarga-kamasya asvarga-sadhane krtrtvanvyo ghatate iti”.56 
is the order of things proclaimed in the scriptures’. He means the following: Out of a desire  for the attainment of fruits, men seek to worship, through actions like yaga, dana and  homa, the supreme Self, Bhagavan Vasudeva, through the deities like Indra, in whom be  dwells as the inner ruler and therefore bears ail the designations like “Indra”. He being so  worshipped gives them the fruits they desire. 
1.   So does the Shruti also declare: ‘The hub of the universe bears all ista and purta, done  before and being done now (Maha).’ By ‘ishta and purta’ are meant actions enjoined by  the Vedas and Smritis. ‘He bears all that’ means that the Supreme Self accepts all  performances, enjoined by the Vedas and Smrtis, ordinarily thought of as associated  with the deities like Indra and Agni, as he dwells in all deities as their inner soul. He is  called the ‘hub of the universe’ as lie is the supporter of the world full of all kinds of  beings like Brahmanas and kshatriyas, by sustaining them through granting the various  objects of their desire, when worshipped by them through their varied acts of worship. The  Shruti also says that the supreme Self himself is named by the designations of all deities  because lie is the inner soul of all deities like Agni and Vayu. ‘That is Agni, that is Vayu,  that is Surya and that is Chandamas (Maha)’. 
2.   The Lord also says, ‘Whatever form any devotee may desire to worship with earnest  faith, I will myself bring about in him immovable faith. towards that deity of his choice.  He, possessed of that faith, worship that deity and from that deity receives boons which, I  myself, give unto him (Gita, 7: 21-22)’. ‘Whatever form (tanu)’ means the various deities,  who are in reality his bodies, as the Lord dwells in them as their inner controller. ‘.1 am  indeed the one who enjoys all sacrifices and I am also their master (Gita, 9:24);’ being  ‘their master’ means that he is the giver of all fruits. Again the scripture say:— ‘Acyuta,  Thou art the embodiment of all gods and art worshipped always through sacrifices (Vi. Pu.  5:20:97);’ ‘Thou art, O Lord, worshipped by those who are devoted to their dharma;  they cross this Maya wholly and attain release of soul (Vi. Pu. 5:30:16)’. 
3.   Thus in all the Vedas, along with the Itihasas (Epics) and Puranas, we learn that all  religious acts are of the nature of the worship of the supreme Lord. He, the supreme  Person so worshipped through them, grants all the desired fruits. This truth is everywhere  explained. 
4.   All the Shruti declares that the omniscient, omnipotent, supreme Lord, Bhagavan  accepts and enjoys all sacred acts like sacrifice, charity and oblation in fire prescribed in  the Vedas, being the inner controller of all deities like Indra and confers on the  worshippers all the fruits of those acts; for instance, ‘Where the catur-hotrs get  connected to the deities (Tait. Ar.. 3: 21)’. Catur-hotrs means sacrifices. ‘Where’ means in  Paramatma, who abides in the deities as the inner ruler; the sacrifices get connected to the  deities in him. In other words, the deities like Indra etc. are brought into relationship with  sacrifices, by the fact that they are the bodies of the supreme Self who dwells in them as  the inner ruler. The Lord also says, ‘Know me as the recipient of all sacrifices and  penances and the great Lord of the worlds (Gita, V, 29)’. Therefore, all religious acts are of  the nature or worship offered to the supreme Person indwelling in all deities like Indra as  their inner ruler. It is lie that grants all objects of all desire. Such being the case, what  utility is there in positing an unseen power (apurva), which is far removed from the  signification of terms as the direct meaning of terms or as a postulate to account for the  fruition of karma ? 
5.   In that case, what meaning is to be attached to the imperative mood of verbs (like  ‘sacrifice’ as in the injunction, ‘Let him sacrifice’) ? The root of the verb, ‘yaj’ means the 
57 
worship of gods. The imperative mood etc. signify that the act signified by the verb-root is  such that it can be performed by the agent. There is clearly no difficulty. The affixes,  referring to the agent, point out the specific ways in which the action referred to by the  verb-root, is related to the activity of the agent. The other affixes tell the tense etc. The  imperative mood etc., point out that act is something that can be accomplished by the  agent. 
1.   Further, the injunctive propositions enjoin a certain course of action upon the person  desirous of a certain result and the same propositions affirm that the Course of’  action enjoined is worship to be offered to deities, and the deities bring about the  realization of the desired end. For example, we have this text, ‘Let him, who is desirous of  prosperity, offer a white animal to Vayu; for Vayu is the swiftest god, The man thus  approaches Vayu with his proper share and Vayu leads him to prosperity (Tai. Samhita,  2:1:1)’. In this instant we see nothing rendering the realization of the end impossible.  Therefore it is unreasonable to suppose that the idea of the action enjoined being the means  to the realization of the end is a later construction of thought built up for completing the  injunction. The idea that the sacrifices etc. are the means for the attainment of ends is  taught by the proposition itself and there is no need for any subsequent construction for  completing the injunctive proposition. 
2.   In the proscriptive injunction, ‘Therefore a brahmin should not be threatened (Mi.  3:4:17)’, the rest of the sentence itself makes know that the prohibited act of threatening a  brahmin leads to the fine of a hundred pieces of gold, and since this idea of the means-end  relation between threatening a brahmin and the fine is contributory to the proscriptive  injunction, it is accepted. In the other case of a man desirous of heaven being enjoined to  perform a sacrifice, why should you resort to the supposition of a subsequent construction  of the idea of sacrifice being the means of the attainment of heaven, with a view to  completing the proposition when in fact the rest or the proposition itself explicitly  lays down that the sacrifice leads to heaven? Why do you disregard the explicitly stated  content of the proposition and posit a supplementary construction of the idea of this means end relationship? It is said that a person placed his treasure of gold in the inner apartment  of his house and went about begging of the poor and miserable for a handful of  grains. Exactly similar is your attitude. 
3.   The causation of the penalty of a hundred pieces of gold is also not through any  unseen power. Persons who perform. actions enjoined in the scriptures, those who fail  to perform such, and those who indulge in prohibited actions, all these come to have  happiness or misery as the case may be, through the favour or disfavour of the Supreme.  The scriptures voice forth this principle: ‘it is he that causes joy (Tai. 2: 7); ‘then he attains  fearlessness (Tai. 2:7),’ ‘Then there is fear for him (Tai. 2: 7);’ ‘Through fear of him the  wind blows, through fear of him the sun rises, through fear of him Agni and Indra obey  and Mytyu, the fifth, speeds along (Tai. 2:8);’ ‘By the command of this imperishable One,  O Gargi, the sun and the moon stand sustained (Brh. Ar. III, viii, 9);’ ‘By the command of  this imperishable One, O Gargi, men (dependent on gifts) praise those that give, the gods,  (dependent on sacrifice), praise the sacrificer, and the manes, dependent on darvihoma,  praise it (Brh. Ar. 3:8: 9)’. 
4.   The Dramida-bhasya also says, ‘By his orders, the wind blows, the rivers flow and the  seas, bounded by him, swell and rise, as if intoxicated’. (Further, the bhashya continues),  ‘These worlds, governed by his will, stand without failing and without bursting up. The  Bhagavan, seeing one who abides by his commands, promotes out of compassion his  progress seeing that he is a man of knowledge and capable in action.’
58 
1.   The seekers who, after acquiring an understanding of the real nature of the supreme  Person, devote themselves to the performance of the correct modes of action like  the meditation on him, will attain through his grace all joys up to the very attainment of  him and perfect freedom from fear. Those, who, on the other hand, do not acquire  that knowledge and do not devote themselves to the performance of the correct modes of  action, like the meditation on him, and in fact,, indulge in actions prohibited, will, through  his disfavour, have as their lot measureless sorrow and fear, resulting from the non 
attainment of him. 
1.   The Lord says, ‘Perform the action that is ordained. Action is superior to non-action  (Gita, 3:8)’. Commencing in this manner he enjoins all actions, preceded by knowledge, as  worthy of performance and then goes on to say, ‘Surrendering all actions unto me (Gita,  111, 30)’ explaining thereby how all these actions are constitutive of the worship of him  and how all the individual selves are subject to his control. He then commends those who  conform to his commands and reproves the contrary as follows:  
‘Those, who always following this view of mine in their life, with earnest faith  and without envy are released from karma. But, O Arjuna, those who are  envious and do not follow this teaching of mine, know them to be devoid of all  knowledge, senseless and lost (Gita, 3: 31-32)’.  
Then, again, he proceeds to point out that the persons, who do not abide by his commands,  are included in the category of the demoniac in nature, and are heirs to a low destiny:  
‘I cast, again and again, those worst of men, who hate me and who are hard hearted and who are unholy, into demoniac births. Having taken demoniac  births and being deluded in birth after birth, they fail to attain me and sink into  great degradation (Gita, 16:19-20)’. 
 He says that those who follow his commands are heirs to everlasting life:  
‘Even though constantly performing all actions, he who has come under my  shelter, will attain through my grace, the good, ever-lasting and entire (Gita,  18: 56)’.  
In the section discussing deities, exaggerated accounts of the self- sufficing efficacy of  sacred works are given, to ward off the attitude of lack of faith concerning works in the  minds of people, who have not yet learnt the Vedanta, the purpose being that they may  have earnest faith at least in sacred works as such. But the true theory of those who know  the Vedas is that the two systems, (karma-mimamsa and jñana-mimamsa) form a single  body of knowledge. 
1.   The texts of the Vedas define the substantive nature or this Narayana, the supreme  Brahman, as infinite knowledge, infinite bliss and infinite purity. They also sing of  his unsurpassed, perfect and Countless holy attributes like knowledge, power, sovereignty,  strength, vigour and radiance. They describe him as one by whose will all other entities,  both sentient and non-sentient, are sustained in their very being and controlled in all their  activities. Similarly there are thousands of Vedic verses which describe him as follows:  His divine form is wholly agreeable and appropriate to him; many kinds of numberless and  infinitely auspicious ornament adorn him, suiting him eminently; he bears  numberless, wondrous weapons, suited to his prowess; his divine consort is agreeable and  stated to him in her essential nature, form, beauty, glory, sovereignty, compassion and  unsurpassed greatness; he is served by (divine) accessories of service and numberless  (divine) servants, who are suited to him and are endowed with holy knowledge and power  of action and countless other virtues; his boundless and magnificent divine abode 
59 
containing all objects and means of delight suited to him, is indescribable and  inconceivable; all these are eternal and perfect. 
1.   The texts are as follows: ‘I know this great Purusha, who is of the colour of the sun,  and is beyond all darkness (Pu.Suk. 20);’ ‘He, who dwells within the Sun, having a form  as if made of gold .... has eyes like the lotus just opening at sunrise (Chan. I, vi, 8);’ ‘In the  space of the heart resides this Purusha, abounding in mind, immortal and resplendent (Tai.  1:6: 1)’. ‘Abounding in mind’ means that he can be apprehended only by a pure mind. ‘All  moments originated from the Purusha, brilliant like lightning (Maha 1, 2)’. The meaning is  that the Purusha has the colour of lightning. 
2.   ‘Luminous like a streak of lightning enclosing a blue cloud (M.B.).’ This means that  the subject spoken of is like a streak of lightning enclosing a blue cloud. The sentence as a  whole means as follows: The flame burning in the space in the centre of the lotus of the  heart has within it the supreme Self whose radiant colour is like that of a blue cloud.  Therefore that flame bears resemblance to a streak of lightning enclosing a blue cloud. 
3.   ‘Abounding in mind, having for his body prana, luminous in form, with desires and  will that always fulfil themselves, pure in nature like akasha, creating all as his own work,  having all objects of desire, all fragrances and all tastes, he has taken possession of all this  (universe), speechless and disinterested (Chan. 3:14:2);’ ‘His raiment is saffron-coloured  (Brh. Ar. 4:3:6)’ etc. 
4.   ‘The Queen of this world is the consort of Vishnu (Ya. 4:4: 12, 57);’ ‘Hri and Laksmi  are his consorts (Pu.Suk. 24);’ ‘The highest abode of Vishnu, the enlightened seers always  see (Ya. 6: 5);’ ‘He who lives beyond this rajas (Ya. 2:2:12);’ ‘That one, unmanifested,  infinite, the totality of the universe, the primeval one, lives beyond tamas’ (M.B.); ‘He  who knows that which is treasured in the cavern, in the highest heavens (.Tai. 2:1);’ ‘He  who is the Lord of this is in the highest heavens Rig. 10:129: 7);’ ‘He is in the highest  imperishable heavens. He indeed is all this, all that is past, that’ will be in future and that is  present. (M.B.)’. Thus hundreds of Shruti passages specifically embody these truths. 
5.   The statement, ‘The enlightened seers always see the supreme abode of Vishnu’  meaning that the supreme abode of the Brahman is always seen by the enlightened seers,  implies that ‘ there are some endowed with complete knowledge, who always see. The  sentence may be construed either as, ‘Those who are enlightened seers, always see’, or  as ‘Those who always see are enlightened seers. 
6.   (Objection): Now, on either interpretation, the proposition is taken as embodying two  different assertions. That is not a correct view, as every proposition must embody a single  assertion. 
(Reply): As all the contents of the proposition are not established otherwise than by this  proposition, we have to interpret it as affirming the transcendent realm, as characterised by  all else, which the proposition itself puts forward. (Such an interpretation is not uncommon  in Vedic exegesis) For instance, it is said, ‘Its attributes are affirmed as there is no division  in affirmation, provided they are not taken over from other sections (Mi. 1:4:9)’. In the  injunction concerning ‘agneya’ ritual of the nature of ‘astakapala’ the ritual is enjoined,  with all the particulars, specifically mentioned only by the injunction itself. The ritual in  the specifically characterized mode, is prescribed. Similar is the situation in this passage  which asserts the existence of the supreme abode of Vishnu as being perpetually seen by  the enlightened seers. There is no contradiction in the method of interpretation adopted.
60 
1.   The followers of the Vedas maintain that the hymns, that are accessory to ritual  action, describing the action under performance, of both the stotra and Sastra types of  hymns, and those which are for sacred repetition, whether they belong to the relevant  section of the Vedas or are taken from elsewhere, do actually teach all that they affirm, like  the brahmana portions, provided what they affirm is not contradictory and is not given to  us elsewhere. The texts throwing light on the act enjoined, subserve the purpose of the  injunction itself, by describing the particulars about the deities etc., the particulars being  free from contradiction and newly presented by the texts themselves under consideration. 
2.   The present passage cannot be taken as referring to the liberated souls, for they do not  always see the transcendent realm. Nor can it refer to the stream of liberated souls, for the  Shruti maintaining that each individual seer always sees, would then be contradicted. We  have already proved that the contents of even hymns and laudatory explanations, that are  subordinate to the injunctions of sacred obligations, ought to be taken as revelatory of  existent realities. A fortiori the import of directly existential passages, like the present one,  can, without any contradiction, be taken as objectively veridical. 
3.   (Objection): But the terms ‘The supreme abode of Vishnu’ need not be taken as  referring to any realm. The very nature of Vishnu is represented as the supreme abode. No  distinction is made between Vishnu and his realm in texts like, ‘The highest abode called  Vishnu, free from all evil (Vi, 1:12: 53)’. 
(Reply): This is not the correct position. The texts, ‘He who lives beyond this rajas (Ya.  2:2:12)’, ‘In that imperishable highest heavens’, ‘He, who is the lord of this, in the highest  heavens (Rig. 10: 129:7)’ and ‘He who knows that one treasured in the cavern, in the  highest heavens (Tai. 2:1)’ definitely proclaim the existence of the highest abode. The very  description of it as Vishnu’s abode points to the realm as different from Vishnu. Even in  the text adduced, the qualification ‘The highest abode called Vishnu’ proves that there is  another highest abode, not one in substance with Vishnu. It is this abode that is described  as being always seen by the enlightened seers. 
1.   The whole matter may be elucidated as follows:— In some texts, the highest abode is  designated by the term ‘parama-pada’, in some, the nature of the individual self freed from  matter, and in some, the very nature of the Bhagavan is designated ‘parama-pada’. The  text ‘parama-pada of Vishnu’ illustrates the usage in relation to the highest abode. The  text ‘His attributeless and great “parama-pada” undergoes threefold modification, owing  to the action of the three attributes of matter, at the periods of creation, maintenance and  destruction (Vi. Pu. I, 23:41)’ clearly speaks of the nature of the individual self freed from  matter. The text ‘Free from evil, that parama-pada, called Vishnu (Vi. Pu. I,22:53)’ is  speaking of the nature of Bhagavan. Now, all these three, (the highest realm, the pure  status of the individual and the Lord) are the supreme ideals to be attained. Hence they are  described as ‘parama-pada’. 
2.   ‘How can all the three be supreme ideals, the summum bonum?’ If this be asked, we  answer thus: The Lord is primarily the supreme ideal to be attained, and therefore he is the  ‘parama-pada’. The other two are included as constituent factors in the attainment of the  Bhagavan. Hence they are designated ‘parama-pada’. The realization by the individual  self of its real nature, through emancipation from the bondage of karma is included in the  attainment of the Supreme. The text, ‘These eternal perfections are veiled by evil (Chan.  8:3:1)’ intimates that the auspicious attributes of the Bhagavan are veiled from the view of  the individual self by its own karma. If it be asked how it is known that the individual’s61 
karma is the evil that conceals the Supreme, we cite the following textual authority:  ‘There is the third power, sattva, called karma, by which power, the all-penetrating power  of the individual self is covered up, and thus covered up, the individual gets enmeshed in  all the persisting afflictions of bondage (Vi. Pu. 7:61-62)’. Even the ascent to the highest  abode is included as a factor in the attainment of the Bhagavan. 
1.   In the passage, ‘He who lives beyond this rajas (Ya 2:2:12)’, the term ‘rajas’ signifies  nature that abounds in the three qualities of sattva, rajas and tamas. This extension of  meaning follows from the fact that pure rajas does not exist by itself. The passage,  therefore, asserts that he exists in the abode, that transcends the natural realm of  three qualities. From this it is understood that Vishnu’s abode is beyond objects  characterized by the three qualities, forming the objects of experience of the individual  selves. Again in the passage, ‘I know this great Person, resplendent like the sun, beyond  tamas (Pu.Suk. 20)’, the word ‘tamas’ signifies the empirical nature distinguished by the  three qualities. This extension of meaning also follows from the principle that pure tamas cannot exist by itself and the statement has oneness of import with the previous one  speaking of the abode beyond rajas. The present text means, ‘I know this great  Person, resplendent like the sun, beyond tamas’. 
2.   Again in the two texts, ‘Brahman is real, knowledge and infinite, and he who knows this as treasured in the cavern, in the highest heavens (Tai. 2:1)’ and ‘In that  imperishable highest heavens (M.B.)’, that realm is characterized as immutable and is  designated the highest heavens. By the phrase ‘imperishable highest heavens’, the  imperishable character of that realm is affirmed and hence it cannot be any perishable  region like the orb of the sun. The description, therefore, of it as the highest heavens  cannot apply to such perishing situations. 
3.   In the same way, in the texts ‘Where the a ancient sadhyas and the devas are (Pu.Suk.  18)’ and ‘Where the firstborn, primordial rsis are (Ya. 2:60)’ the perfect seers are spoken  of. The passage ‘The seers of intelligence, given to praise and of unfailing knowledge  flourish glorifying that supreme abode of Vishnu’, also speaks of the same matter. It means  that there are seers of supreme intelligence, devoted to praise, whose understanding never  fails and that they always sing of the glories of this abode of Vishnu and thus flourish. 
4.   Now this abode and seers of timeless vision are included in the being of the Supreme,  even as his attributes like knowledge and power are; and these, like the attributes, are  incorporated in text, ‘Being alone, this was in the beginning (Chan. 6:2:1)’ as forming an  element in the being of Brahman. They are taken as included in the significance of the  term, ‘Being alone, one without a second’, for ultimately they constitute a part of the  glorious attributes of the supreme Brahman. In the passage, ‘Being alone, this was in the  beginning’ the term ‘this’ denoted the individual selves governed by karma and the objects  of their experience. In the text, ‘The enlightened seers always see (Ya. 6: 5)’, these being  timeless seers, are shown to be not included among the individual selves governed by  karma. 
5.   In the passage, ‘That is the self, free from sin, ageless, deathless, griefless, free from  hunger and thirst, whose desires are satya and whose will is satya’, beginning with the first  epithet, ‘free from sin’ up to ‘free from thirst’, the evil characteristics of Prakriti with its  threefold properties, its products and the individual selves caught up in Prakriti— all the  three forming instruments of his cosmic play— are denied of Brahman. Then the term  ‘satyakama’ occurs. The term signifies that entities which are objects and instruments  of divine joy are eternal. Satyakama is one whose desires are real. Desire (kama) means 
62 
whatever is desired. Whatever entities are desired by the supreme Brahman as objects  and instruments of his joy are said to be satya i.e., eternal. The instruments of his cosmic  play, though real, being cognisable through valid means of cognition, are subject to change  and therefore are not abiding. In contrast to them, these objects and instruments of divine  (nitya) joy are abiding. The term ‘satya’ connotes this abiding nature of these entities. 
1.   The epithet ‘satya-sankalpa’ brings out the idea that, even though these objects and  instruments of divine joy are eternal, unsurpassed and limitless, other entities, creations  new and measureless, are brought into existence by his mere will. The term ‘satya sankalpa’ serves to enunciate that these objects and instruments of divine joy (nitya)  and divine play (lila) sentient and non-sentient, unchanging and changing, have their  nature, existence, activities and differentiations, sustained and controlled by the will of  the Supreme. 
2.   The Itihasas (Epics) and Puranas, works seeking to augment the Vedas, embody the  same truth: Sri Ramayana undertakes to augment the Vedas as evidenced by the  opening, ‘The master, seeing those two brilliant pupils, well established in the Vedas, took  them up for purposes of reinforcing the Vedas (Balakanda, 4: 6)’. Sri Ramayana goes on:  ‘It is clear that this is the great yogin, the supreme Self, the primordial One. He is without a  beginning, middle and end. He greatly surpasses whatever is great. He is beyond tamas. He  is the creator. He wears the conch, the discus and the mace. There is Srivatsa-mark on his  chest and goddess Sri eternally belongs to him. He is unconquerable, eternal  and everlasting (Yuddhakanda, 114: 14-15).’ And again, ‘The various arrows of many  kinds and the bow, assumed personal forms and followed Sri Rama, the descendent of  Kakutstha (Uttarakanda, 109:2)’. ‘He, even as embodied, passed into the realm of Vishnu,  with all his followers (Uttarakanda, 110:12)’. 
3.   Sri-Vishnu-Purana says: ‘O King, that majestic form of Vishnu is different. It  transcends all the forms of the universe. In that transcendent form are established all  the powers (Vi. Pu. 7:70). That is the Brahman in form, O great one; Hari has, as contained  in himself, all individual selves that are perfect (Vi. Pu. 1:22: 63). This Sri, the Mother of  the universe, is eternal and knows no separation from Vishnu. Even as Vishnu is all 
pervading, she is all-pervading (Vi. Pu. I,8:17). When he becomes a deva, she assumes the  deva- form., When he becomes a man, she too becomes a human being. She makes her  form conform to the form of Vishnu (Vi. Pu. 1:9:145). Those who are yogins, who  meditate on Brahman always and whose devotion is undivided, attain to the supreme  abode, which the enlightened seers always see (Vi. Pu. 1:6:38). Time, consisting of kala,  muhurta, etc., cannot cause modification in that glorious manifestation (Vi. Pu. 4:1: 84)’ 
1.   The Mahabharata says: “O Lord, go thou to that celestial, ageless, immeasurable,  incomprehensible and primordial realm, knowable through the scriptures; by taking births  in epoch after epoch in thy transcendent form, protect us, thy self-surrendering devotees.  There, time is not the master, rather it is subdued there’. 
2.   That the supreme Brahman has a transcendent form is established by the Sutrakara in  the Sutra: ‘The one proclaimed as dwelling in the sun and the eye is he, as his attributes are  proclaimed (B.S. 1:1:21)’. (The Sutra contends that he, whose form is praised in the text  under discussion, is the ultimate Brahman himself.) 
3.   His lustre is that of a fine mountain of molten gold — He has the splendour of a  hundred thousand suns. His pure eyes have the beauty of the petals of a lotus, just  unfolding under the rays of the sun and crowning a rich stalk, that has sprung up in deep 
63 
waters. His brows and forehead and nose are charming. His coral-like lips radiate a pure  smile. His cheeks are tender and radiant. His neck is lovely like a conch. His exquisitely  tender ear-lobes are almost touching his high shoulders. His arms are well-developed,  round and long. His beautiful and roseate palms are adorned with fingers of the same hue.  His waist is slender and chest broad. All parts of his person are proportionate and  symmetrical. The divine harmony of his features beggars all description. His complexion is  effulgent. His lovely feet are like full-blown lotuses. His gold-hued raiment eminently  suits His person. He is adorned by pure, divine and infinitely marvellous ornaments like  kirita, kundala, hara, kaustubha, keyura, kataka, nupura, and udara-bandhana. He is  also bedecked with the conch, discus, mace, sword, bow, Srivatsa and vanamala. He has  captivated the eyes and hearts of all by his Surpassingly sublime beauty. The nectar of his  pervasive loveliness fills and overflows all existence, sentient and non-sentient. His eternal  and inconceivable youthfulness is infinitely marvellous. He has the delicate freshness of  smiling blossoms. The endless expanse of the universe is perfumed by his holy fragrance.  He shines in his supreme majesty he envelopes the three worlds. He looks at his  devotees with a look of compassion, love and sweetness. This supreme Person, seen within  the sun is the ultimate one who sports, through the creation, maintenance and dissolution of  the whole world, who is antithetical to all evil, who is an ocean I of all auspicious  attributes and who stands unique above all other entities. He is the supreme Brahman, the  highest Self, Narayana. 
1.   This is supported by the following: ‘The one proclaimed as dwelling in the sun and,  the eye is he, as his attributes are proclaimed (B.S. 1:1:21);’ ‘He is the Lord of all the  worlds and all objects of desire;’ ‘He rises beyond all sins (Chan. 1:6:7)’. To him belong  the attributes enunciated in the following texts: ‘He is the ruler of all, the Lord of all, (Brh.  Ar. 4:4: 22);’ and the text commencing with ‘He is free from sin and ageless’ and  concluding with ‘His will fulfils itself without fail (Chan. 8:1:5)’. ‘Narayana is great  beyond the universe, he is eternal, he is all; he is Hari (M.B.);’ ‘The lord of the universe  and the individual selves (Maha,).’ 
2.   The Vakyakara clearly states this: ‘The text, “The Purusha of the golden form is  seen” is speaking of the omniscient one, the inmost soul of all; for the texts speak of him as  being the Lord of the worlds and desires and as transcending the sins’. He himself  repudiates the suggestion that the form is temporal. He takes note of the objection, ‘The  form may be artificial being assumed to favour the individual self, as it is possible for the  omnipotent Lord to assume such forms’. This prima-facie, view means that the form is  taken by the supreme Purusha for favouring graciously those who meditate on him. He  answers, ‘But His form is real and super sensuous, because the Shrutis state that it  Is perceptible to the inner eye’. His meaning is that just as knowledge etc. are taken as  inherent attributes of the supreme Brahman, because they are so stated in the scriptures,  this form also described as inherent to the supreme Brahman, must be so taken. 
3.   The Bhasyakara (Dramidacarya) comments as follows: ‘Inherent and natural is the  form of the creator. But it is not perceptible to the eye. It is perceptible only to the purified  mind equipped with the other spiritual means. The Vedic text lays down, “He is not  apprehended through the eye. He is not within the reach of speech. But he is apprehended  through a pure mind (Mu. 3: 8)”. The form of the Deity inherently formless is not taught in  the Shastra. The Shastra verily speaks the truth. There is the evidence of other sections:  “His raiment is saffron-coloured (Brh. Ar. 4:3:6)” and “I know this great Purusha resplendent like the sun transcending all darkness (Pu.Suk. 20)”.,
64 
1.   The Vakyakara says: ‘The Supreme is spoken of as of golden form (Hiranmaya)” on  the ground of likeness of lustre, as in the case of the expression, “moon-faced”.’ ‘The  Bhasyakara also says: ‘The maya suffix does not signify that the Purusha is a modification  of gold, for the atman is not a product. 
2.   Just as, on the strength of the holy texts asserting the infinite auspicious attributes of  Brahman like jñana, the supreme Brahman is admitted to be characterized by countless  hosts of auspicious attributes, on the strength of the same holy texts like the one which  describes him as ‘Purusha resplendent like the sun’, the supreme Purusha, Narayana,  must be admitted as possessing the most auspicious and sublime form, at once pleasing to  him and worthy of him. Similarly on the basis of texts like ‘The Queen of this world (Ya.  4:7:39)’, ‘Hri and Laksmi are your consorts (Pu.Suk. 24)’, ‘The enlightened seers always  see’, ‘He is beyond tamas (Pu.Suk. 20)’, and ‘He lives beyond this rajas’, which speak of  his divine consorts, servants and abode, they are to be admitted as realities. As ‘the  Bhasyakara observes, ‘The Shastra verily speaks the truth’. 
3.   The matter stands this way: Just as, on the authority of texts like ‘Brahman is real,  knowledge and infinite (Tai. 2:I)’, the substantive nature of the supreme Self is recognised  as unique, transcending all else, being opposed to all evil, of the nature of absolute  bliss and infinite, even so, on the authority of texts like ‘He knows all, cognises all  (Mun.2:2:7)’, ‘His supreme manifold power and his inherent knowledge, strength and  activity are spoken of in the Vedas (Sve. 6:7)’ and ‘.He is luminous and all ‘things  shine after him, the luminous one. Through his radiance does all this shine (Ka. 2:5:15)’,  Brahman is to be recognised as distinguished by unsurpassed and countless excellences  which are his unique attributes; similarly, on the authority of texts like “The Purusha resplendent like the sun’, his (divine) form, (eternal) devotees and (transcendent) abode,  which are unique and indescribable, must be recognized. 
4.   If the Vedas are the sources of valid knowledge, they truly teach all that is contained  in the injunctions, explanations and hymns, provided they transcend other sources of  knowledge and are free from contradiction. The truth of the Vedas is affirmed in the  aphorism, ‘The relation of words to facts is natural (Mim. 1:1:7)’. Just as fire and water  do naturally possess their properties like heat, just as the senses like sight and hearing are  naturally productive or particular kinds of cognition. the words also have a natural power  of imparting knowledge. 
5.   It is not reasonable to maintain that the signifying power of words is due to arbitrary  conventions set up by men as in the case of gesture. This is proved by the fact that there is  unbroken continuity of linguistic tradition from begininngless past, and there is no  historical knowledge regarding the founding of such fresh and arbitrary conventions.  Wherever there is such setting up of conventions, there is either direct or indirect  knowledge bearing on the initiation of such conventions. The significance of all  terms cannot be construed on the analogy of proper names like ‘Devadatta’. In relation to  the latter type of words, there is either direct or indirect information on the fixing of  such names. In the case of terms like ‘cow’ there is an unbroken tradition of usage from  beginningless past and yet, there is no knowledge of any definite foundation of arbitrary  symbolism. Hence, as fire etc., have their inherent properties like heat, and as the particular  sense-organs originate cognition about particular aspects of nature, we are obliged to  acknowledge that the power of words to signify is natural. 
6.   It may be asked in objection, why there is a necessity to learn the connection of  particular words with particular meanings, if their power of giving information is natural 
65 
and Inherent, on the analogy of sense-organs. We reply that the necessity arises as in the  case of the inferential mark (middle term). The smoke originates the thought of fire only  through the understanding of the connection between smoke and fire. Even so a term  originates thought of a particular object only through the understanding its connection with  its proper meaning. ‘If so’, it may be said:— “words being nothing but inferential marks of  meanings, apprehension originating from verbal testimony is merely a species of  inference’. We answer that the case is not so. The words are related to things as signifiers  to the signified. The relation of smoke to fire etc., is relation of another type. It is through  knowledge of that relationship that words have the power of originating knowledge. 
1.   Thus, the relationship between words and their meaning being understood, then power  to cause the thought of things must be admitted to be natural as there s unbroken tradition  of usage from immemorial past and yet there is no knowledge of the foundation of any  arbitrary symbolism. Thus the power of words to convey meaning being natural, groups of  words, conveying particular combinations of such meanings, are described as sentences.  All cases in which the words are uttered in the order arranged by human intelligence are  called ‘personal’. Those cases are always said to be impersonal and constitutive of the  Vedas in which the order of words in utterance is governed by the Culture born of a prior  recitation. 
2.   This is what is meant by the impersonal character and eternality of the Vedas. This  impersonal character and eternality may be defined in the following manner: A body  of’ words is said to possess impersonal character and eternality, if their order of utterance  conforms to a pre-established order and proceeds from a remembrance of that order, which  arises from the culture shaped by the prior practice of utterance in the same order. This  order is being maintained by the tradition of recitation. The group of words, so preserved  in a fixed order, constitute the Vedas divided into Rik, Yajus. Sama, Atharvana, containing  an endless number of branches. The Vedic statements have three forms — vidhi (injunction.) — arthavada (explanatory passage commending the prescribed action or  condemning the prohibited action) and mantra (hymns). Now through all these divisions,  branches and forms, the Vedas in their totality teach us the nature of Narayana, the  supreme Brahman, the mode of worshipping him and the purposes whose fulfilment is  brought about by him as a result of such worship. Even as the supreme Person is eternal,  the system of words embodying the knowledge concerning him, his worship and the fruits  accruing there from, is eternal. 
3.   As the Vedas are endless and as their import is unfathomable, profound, great sages,  commissioned by the Supreme Being, recollect the import of the Vedas and compose in  epoch after epoch the Dharma-Shastras, Itihasas (Epics) , and Puranas, rooted in the  vidhi’s, arthavadas and mantras, for the welfare of the whole world. 
4.   Even words used in ordinary linguistic practice, have been taken out of the huge mass  of Vedic utterances and are used in their various meanings in accordance with previous  usage and flow of tradition. If it is asked, ‘If all words are Vedic words, why are there  separate definitions of the Vedic sense and ordinary sense of words?’ the explanation is  that when words are used in the pre-established Vedic order, they carry their original  significance, and when they are used in a different order, they bear other meanings. There  is no flaw in the procedure whatever. 
5.   Thus the Vedas, along with the auxiliary disciplines, Supported by the Itihasas (Epics)  , Puranas and dharma-Shastras, impart knowledge about the supreme Brahman. The  Brahman knowable through the Vedas is Narayana, who is antithetical to all evil,66 
transcendent and unique. In his substantive nature, he is infinite knowledge and bliss. He is  an ocean of countless hosts of auspicious attributes, inherent and unlimited in their  excellence. All sentient and non-sentient entities, have their nature, existence, activities  and mutual differences controlled by his will. His supreme glory is infinite and beyond  thought in its nature and attributes. He has as the means of his sport, the entire universe,  consisting of multitudinous kinds of countless sentient and non-sentient entities. 
1.   Brahman himself, qualified by all entities as his modes, constituting his body, is  signified by all terms in these and similar texts, which are applied to him by way of co ordinate predication: ‘All this verily is Brahman (Chan. 3:14:1 ), ‘All this is ensouled by  this .... That thou art, O, Svetaketu (Chan. VI, viii, 7);’ ‘Some name him Agni, others name  him Marut, others again speak of him as Prajapati. Some others name him Indra. Some  others consider him as Prana, and others describe him as the eternal Brahman (Ma. 12:  123);’ ‘All fires, all lights, all the three worlds, all the divine rulers of worlds, all the  Vedas, all the three sacred files and all the five oblations — all these are the son of  Devaki alone (Bha.);’ ‘Thou art the sacrifice, the sacred vasatkara and the holy syllable  “Aum”. Thou art the destroyer of foes (Ra. Yuddhakanda, 120: 20);’ ‘Thou were in the  ancient times the Vasu, called Rtadhama, among the Vasus. Thou art Prajapati (Ra.  Yuddhakanda, 120:7);”The whole universe is thy body. The earth is thy power of stability.  Agni is thy anger, Soma is thy grace, thou art endowed with Srivatsa- mark (Ra.  Yuddhakanda, 120:26);’ ‘The fires are Vishnu. The worlds are Vishnu. The forests are  Vishnu. The mountains and quarters are Vishnu. The rivers and seas are Vishnu. He is all,  O Brahmin all that is and all that is not (Vi. Pu. 6:5:72)’. 
2.   The supreme Brahman, whose will becomes irresistibly realized, resolved by himself  to take up many modes and thought, ‘Let me become many’. In him were submerged  the great elements in their subtle form, comprising the sum total of non-sentient nature.  The aggregate of individual selves was also submerged in him. The Supreme brought them  to manifestation through differentiation. Out of the subtle elements he created the great  gross elements. He caused the individual selves to enter them as principles of their  animation, He then brought into being the whole of this gross world out of those elements,  animated by the conscious principles, through mutual permutations and  combinations. Then the supreme Brahman entered into all those entities as their ultimate  soul. Thus he exists in the state of effect as the supreme Self with all existence constituting  his body. He exists characterized by these as his modes. 
3.   The great elements in their primeval subtle condition constitute what is called  Prakriti. The sum total of individual selves is called Purusha. These two, Prakriti and Purusha, as they are constitutive of the body of the Supreme, are his modes. Thus the  Paramatman, himself, with them as his modes, is designated by the terms ‘Prakriti’ and  ‘Purusha’. All that has been so far elaborated on this matter, is brought out clearly even in  this single passage: ‘He desired, “Let me be many ; having created that, he entered into  that, having entered that, he became the unchanging and the changing, the defined and the  undefined, the supporter and the supported, the sentient and the non-sentient. Remaining  the real, he became the real and the unreal (Tai. 2:6)’. 
4.   The means for the attainment of Brahman is para- Bhakti, which is of the nature of  meditation that has become an object of supreme attachment (to the meditator) and  has acquired the vividness of clearest perception. This para- Bhakti is to be attained  through the pathway of devotion, which in its turn is aided by one’s performance of his  duties after a due understanding of the nature of reality through the scripture. The term  Bhakti signifies a particular kind of love. (priti). Love is a particular kind of cognition.
67 
1.   ‘But love is the same thing as joy. Joy, as understood in the world, is something that  results from cognition and is other than cognition’. If this objection be raised, we answer  that the truth is not so. The cognition which said to result in joy, is itself that joy. 
2.   To Explain: Cognition of objects is common to all the three types of experiences — joy, pain and emotional neutrality. Cognition, which depends upon its objective content for  its specific quality, acquires the aforesaid qualities (of joy or pain or the neutral state) as  determined by its objective content. The cognition of that object — the cognition qualified  by which object is said to lead to joy — is itself the joy in question. Nothing other than this  cognition can be discerned in the experience of joy. By this cognition itself the experience  of joy is accounted for. 
3.   Entities other than Brahman can be objects of such cognitions of the nature of joy  only to a finite extent and for limited duration. But Brahman is such that cognising of  him is an infinite and abiding joy. It is for this reason that the Shruti says, ‘Brahman is  bliss (Tai. 2:6)’. Since the form of cognition as joy is determined by its object, Brahman  itself is joy. 
4.   This has been so stated in the sacred text, ‘He is rasa; attaining this rasa, the cognisor  becomes blissful (Tai. 2:7)’. It means that, as Brahman is joy, the person who .attains  Brahman becomes joyous. The supreme Purusha is unsurpassed and infinite joy by himself  and in himself. He becomes the joy of another also, as his nature as joy is absolute and  universal. When Brahman becomes the object of one’s contemplation, he (the meditator)  becomes blissful. 
5.   Thus the supreme Brahman is the ocean of infinite and unsurpassed excellences of  attributes. He transcends all evil. The expanse of his glory is boundless. He abounds  in surpassing condescension, maternal compassion and supreme beauty. He is the principal  entity (Sheshin). The individual self is subservient to him. If a seeker meditates on the  Supreme with a full consciousness of this relationship (between the Lord and himself) as  the principal entity and subsidiary entity, and if the supreme Brahman so meditated upon  becomes an object of supreme love to the devotee, then he himself effectuates the  devotee’s god-realization. 
6.   (Objection): ‘It is maintained that absolute subordination is the highest joy for the  soul. This is opposed to the understanding of the whole world. All sentient beings have  independence as the highest object of desire. Dependence is extremely painful. Smrti also  says, ‘All dependence on others is painful. All self-dependence is happiness (Ma. 4: 160)’  and again, ‘Service is a dog’s life. Therefore one should give it up (Ma. 4: 6)’. 
7.   (Reply): This is the attitude of those who have failed to comprehend the nature of the  self as different from the body, and is due to their mistaken attachment to the body as the  self. To explain: The body is the individual locus of the attributes like the generic character  connoted by terms like man, god, etc., and is taken to be an independent entity.  The individual self caught up in the transmigratory circle of existence looks upon the body  as ‘1’. The conception of value is determined by the conception of the self. The individual  selves looking upon themselves as lions, tigers, bears, men, yakshas, raksasas, pishacas,  gods, demons, females and males, have corresponding and mutually separate conceptions  of what is to be desired and what is to be avoided. These various conceptions of value are  mutually contradictory. Therefore, the whole position is cleared up and explained on the 
68 
principle that what an individual pursues as a desirable end depends upon what he  conceives himself to be. 
1.   In reality the nature of the self is that it is different from the body, that it is of the  nature of consciousness and that in its essence it is subsidiary to the Supreme. When the  individual forms a true conception of himself, he pursues ends that accord with that  conception. That the nature of the self is consciousness is stated by the Smriti text, ‘The  self is full of knowledge and is pure (Vi. Pu. 6:8:22)’. The Shruti texts like ‘He is the Lord  of the universe (M.B.)’, propound that the individual self’s nature is to be subservient to  the supreme Self. Therefore it is to be understood that, as the conception of oneself as lion  or tiger is due to the misapprehension of the self arising from karma, even so is the  conception oneself as self-dependent. 
2.   Therefore, the value of everything, other than the supreme Person, is due only to  karma. Hence they are trivial and transitory. Only the supreme Person is intrinsically  of’ the nature of joy. Hence only the joy in him is infinite and abiding. The Shruti says,  ‘Brahman is bliss, Brahman is akasha’ (Chan. 4:10:5)’, ‘Brahman is bliss (Tai. 3:6)’ and  ‘Brahman is real, knowledge and infinite (Tai. 2:1)’. 
3.   Bhagavan Parashara has set forth in the following verses how everything other than  Brahman lacks intrinsic power to bring joy’ and whatever joy we happen to derive from  them is therefore transient, being determined by karma:— ‘O Brahmin, by hell and heaven  only demerit and merit are meant (Vi. Pu. 2:6:44). The same object causes pain,  pleasure, envy and anger. Therefore, how can these features like causing, pleasure etc. be  the essentia1 nature of the object? (Vi. Pu. 2:6: 45) How can the causation of pleasure or  pain be the universal and necessary nature of any object? The only universal and necessary  factor in the causation of pleasure and pain is the determination by karma. This is the idea. 
4.   After thus determining the variability and relativity of the nature of empirical sources  of- pleasure and pain in relation to different individuals, he goes on to show that empirical  objects do not behave consistently even in relation to a single person: ‘The same object,  which please at one time, comes to cause pain at another time; the same causes anger at  one time and at a later moment brings about tranquillity (Vi. Pu. 2:6:46). There is nothing  that is pleasant in its inherent nature and nothing that is painful in itself (Vi. Pu. 2:6:47)’. It  thus gets explained that all objects are pleasurable or painful through the force of karma  and not through their intrinsic nature and therefore on the liquidation of the determining  karma, the particular effects by way of pleasure and pain disappear. 
5.   The statement ‘All dependence is painful’ simply means that dependence on anything  or anyone other than the supreme Person is painful, because there is no relationship of the  principal entity and the subsidiary between anyone other than Brahman and oneself.  ‘Service is a dog’s life’ also means that service of one who is unworthy of service is  dog’s life. The following text says that the only one that ought to be served by all who are  enlightened about the fundamental nature of the self, is the highest Purusha: ‘He is to be  served by people in all stages or life. He alone is to be served by all.’ The Lord says:— 
‘He who serves me, following the path of undivided Bhakti, transcends these  qualities (of Prakriti) and will attain self-realization (Gita 14: 26)’. 
1.   It has already been elucidated that It is only this service of the form of Bhakti that is  spoken of as knowledge in the texts, ‘One who knows Brahman attains the Highest (Tai.  2:1)’, ‘He who knows him becomes immortal here (Pu.Suk. 20)’ and ‘He who knows Brahman becomes Brahman (Mu.3:2:9)’. In the other text qualifying this knowledge, ‘This 
69 
atman is attained by one, whom he chooses’, the clause, ‘whom he chooses’ conveys the  idea of the seeker becoming an object of choice to the Bhagavan. He comes to be  chosen, who is the object of greatest love. He becomes the object of greatest love to the  Lord in whom has arisen supreme love for the Lord. The Bhagavan says,  
‘I am ineffably dear to the man of knowledge and he is also dear to me (Gita, 7:  17)’. 
 Therefore in reality, only knowledge that is of the nature of supreme Bhakti is the means  for attaining the Bhagavan. 
1.   Bhagavan Dvaipayana has enunciated this truth in the Moksa-dharma and has thereby  furnished a commentary on the whole of the Upanishads. He says:— ‘His form does  not fall within the range of perception. No one sees him with his eyes. He, whose mind has  been brought to the state of samadhi by determined effort, sees him who is of the nature of  knowledge, through Bhakti’. The meaning is that one who by determined effort fixes his  whole mind on the supreme Purusha, sees him through Bhakti. Here ‘seeing’ means  direct perception, and ‘direct perception’ means attainment. It is thus that the passage  would be one in meaning with the Lord’s declaration,  
‘I am attainable only through undivided Bhakti (Gita, 11:54)’.  
Bhakti, therefore is only a special form of knowledge. thus the explanation is complete and  satisfactory. 
This work, Vedanta-sangraha, has been composed in the hope that there are persons who  are gifted with discriminative insight into what is essential and non-essential, who are  endowed with breadth of vision and openness of mind and who are solely guided by the  pramanas.
