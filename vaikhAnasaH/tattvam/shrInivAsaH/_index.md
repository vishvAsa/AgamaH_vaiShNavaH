> 
> One of them met Ramanujacharya on tirumala. This is there on official records. Name is also mentioned in temple inscriptions (forgit exact panel number) .  
> 
> However same name also pops up in 14-15 centuries also. So 2 different people under same moniker ( maybe more than 2). 
> 
> But apparently sreenivasa makin couldnt complete writing an elaborate commentary on……. ( forgot what specific topic it was) so 2-3 people finished it. One of them is also named after him.
