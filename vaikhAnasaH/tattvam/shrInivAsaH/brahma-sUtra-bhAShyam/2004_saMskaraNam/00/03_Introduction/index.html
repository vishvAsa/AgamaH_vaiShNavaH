  <meta property="og:description" content="Prof. S.K. RAMACHANDRA RAO Included in the celebrated Vedantic triad known as Prasthanatraya is the Sutra-compendium (called variously Vedanta- sutras, Sariraka sutras, Sariraka-mimamsa-sutras, Brahma-sutras, Vaiyasika-sutras and Uttara-mimamsa-sutras), ascribed to Badarayana or Vyasa (son of Parasara, hence Parasarya), the other two being the Upanishads (properly called the Vedanta) and the Bhagavad Gita. The Sutra-text is described as Nyaya-prasthana, as it tries to examine the existence and nature of Brahman vis a vis the world in a rational context, with arguments and counter-arguments, with doubts raised and cleared, and with suggestions for a final and incontrovertible conclusion (the sutra’s main function being to suggest conclusions, ‘suchanat-sutram’). It seeks to present a cogent, consistent and intellectually edifying account of the Upanishadic philosophy (hence called Vedanta-sutras), and its merit consists in the analytical spirit and the methodological approach of inquiry and examination (which the expression, mimamsa, really means). It is aphoristic in nature (sutra-style), and the text consists of short, cryptic and suggestive groups of words. The well-known definition of the sutra is that it contains but few words (alpaksharam), which are unambiguous (asandigdham), and suggestive of a world of meanings (saravad visvato-mukham). However, the rigorous economy of the words, coupled with the highly suggestive character of the arrangement of the words, has resulted in a variety of interpretations. While the nature of the literary structure of the Sutra-compendium as containing a large number of topics or adhikaranas arranged in four chapters or adhyayas, each having four sections (or padas) is universally accepted, the number of aphorisms and topics are not unanimously given by the commentators on the text. The earliest commentator is Samkara (632-644 A.D.), whose approach to the Sutra has been described as unqualified non-dualism (nirviseshadvaita). It must be remembered that Badarayana was not 10 the only Sutra-kara, although his work it is that has survived till this day. He himself has mentioned the names and views of some of the earlier sutra-karas, like Asmarathya, Kasakrtsna, Audulomi, Badari and Jaimini (not the author of the Purvamimamsa-sutra). The differences among the commentators may be due to the survival of the views of these earlier sutra-karas. Samkara, for instance, upholds the views of Kasartsna. Samkara who hailed from South India takes the text of Badarayana as consisting of 555 aphorisms, (sutras) and 191 topics (adhikaranas). Bhaskara, who came after him (around 1000 A.D), and interpreted the text as favouring the Aupadhika Bhedabheda (conditional dualism and non-dualism) view, took the text as consisting of 534 sutras and 140 adhikaranas, For Ramanuja (1017- 1150) whose Sri-bhashya on the text favoured the Visishtadvaita (qualified non-dualism) view, the text had 545 sutras and 140 adhikaranas. Anandatirtha (1238-1317), whose commentary on the text is known as Brahma sutra-bhashya, projected the Dvaita (pluralism and realism) view on the text, which according to him consists of 534 sutras and 123 adhikaranas. These three viewpoints (excluding Bhaskara’s) are widely prevalent in the country to this day, and they have been explained by numerous glosses and annotations over the years. Among other commentaries on the text may be mentioned the vedanta-parijata of Nimbarka (around 1250 A.D.) of Central India, whose text consists of 549 sutras and 161 adhikaranas and who favoured the Dvaitadvaita viewpoint; the Saiva-bhashya of Srikantha (around 1270 A.D.) from Kashmir, who interpreted the text (of 544 sutras and 182 adhikaranas) in the Saiva-visishtadvaita context; the Srikara-bhashya of Sripati (around 1400 A.D.) who favoured the Sakti-Visishtadvaita View point; the Anubhashya of Vallabha (around 1500 A.D.) of Gujarat, which takes the text as consisting of 554 sutras and 171 adhikaranas and as favouring the Suddhadvaita viewpoint; the Vijnanamrta-bhashya of Vijnana-bhikshu (around 1600 A.D.), projecting the Avibhagadvaita view; and the Govinda-bhashya of Baladeva (around 1725) supporting the Achintya-bhedabheda doctrine. While these commentaries have come down to us, there are many which have been lost. Among the references available, we find that Yadavaprakasa, who lived after Bhaskara and before Ramanuja (or rather during Ramanuja’s days)11 had written a commentary, now no longer extant, upholding the view of Svabhavikabhedabheda (natural dualism and non-dualism), modifying Bhaskara’s view. A commentary that is little known but is of great importance is called Lakshmi-visishtadvaita (of Sri-visishtadvaita) - bhashya prepared by Srinivasa-makhin (Srinivasa-dikshita, Srinivasadhvari) of the Vaikhanasa tradition, which is the hoary antiquity. The name ‘Visishtadvaita’ was brought into vogue by the work of Ramanuja- charya (1017-1150), who however called his own commentary on the Sariraka-sutras Sri-bhashya. The expression ‘visishta’ (meaning “qualified”) associated with ‘advaita’ (the one, without a second as the sole reality) refers here to the Brahman having the sentient and insentient orders of existence as his own body (chidachid-prakara). We do not find the expression Visishtadvaita in Atri’s Samurtarchadhikarana or Bhrgu’s Prakirnadhikara as signifying the Vaikhanasa viewpoint. Srinivasa-mukhin specifies that the Brahman (Narayana) is invariably associated with Lakshmi, and that it is in this sense that he is ‘visishta’. Thus Ramanuja’s Visishtadvaita, is not the same as the Vaikhanasa Visishtadvaita which Srinivasa- makhin expounded, as it is commonly misconceived. The Vaikhanasa viewpoint had been prevailing from very ancient times, and even the Alwars were acquainted with it, long before the days of Ramanuja. It is not unlikely therefore that Ramanuja was to some extent influenced by the Vaikhanasa approach to divinity and Deity. This may explain the similarity of ideas that we find in Sribhashya and Lakshmi-visishtadvaita-bhashya. It is not to be construed that the latter borrowed from the former. The differences in the approaches are too conspicuous to be ignored. They will be indicated later. Ilattur Sundara-raja-Bhattacharya, who claims to be a student of Srinivasa-makhin (’natir me yam gurave’ stu tasmai’, 41), has written a short biogrophical account of his master, entitled ‘Srinivasa-dikshitendra-charitram’. He mentions here that Srinivasa- makhin was born in 4030 of the Kali-era (’trimsad-uttara-chatuhsah- asregha-vyatiteshu’), corresponding to about 1030 A.D. This would make him a junior contemporary of Ramanuja. The book also makes a specific reference to Srinivasa- makhin being earlier to Venkata- 12 natha who is celebrated as ‘Vedanta-Desika’ (b.1268). Srinivasa- makhin also had this title, as also ‘Sarvaranta-svatantra’ in common with Venkata-natha. According to the book, Srinivasa-makhin was the son of Govindacharya who was the chief priest of the hilt-shrine of Vengadam, the presentday Tirumala-Tirupati in Andhra Pradesh. The boy was invested with the sacred thread when he was five years old, and brought before the Venkatesvara image in the sanctum to begin his hereditary vocation as priest. He filled this position is later life with great devotion. It is probable that Ramanuja visited the shrine when Govindacharya was the priest, and that the two met. Srinivasa-makhin was unusually talented, and distinguished himself as a versatile scholar, poet and writer. He wrote many books, more than 25, all in Sanskrit to highlight the significance of the Vaikhanasa community to the religious traditions of the country. His works explain and vindicate the Vaikhanasa point of view regarding Siddhanta as well as Sampradaya. He was honoured widely. But he continued to serve as priest in the shrine of Venkatesvara all his life. Among his works, of particular interest to us here are his commentary on the Sariraka-sutra (Vedanta-sutra), a gloss an Paramatmikopanishad and an independent work called Uttamabrahma-vidya-sara. Sundara-raja’s biographical account also mentions that Srinivasa-makhin wrote a commentary on Valmiki Ramayana another on the Vaikhanasa-sutra, and some independent books like Tithinirnaya, Srauta-vishaya-prayaschitta and Vaikhanasa-mahima-manjari. He was also a staunch votary of Karmakanda, having performed all the prescribed paka-yajnas, havir- yajnas and soma-yaga. It was threfore that he was called ‘makhin’ (dikshita, adhvari). The work that is published now is his commentary (bhashya) on Badarayana’s Vedanta-sutra (Sariraka-sutra). The colophon to this work entitled Sri-visishtadvaita-bhashya reads: इति श्रीवेङ्कटेशपादाब्जसपर्यारत सर्वतन्त्रस्वतन्त्र श्रीर्वैखानसावतंस वेदान्तदेशिक श्रीनिवासमखीन्द्र विरचिते श्रीविशिष्टाद्वैतभाष्ये चतुर्थाध्यायस्य चतुर्थः पादः अध्यायश्च समाप्तः । शस्त्रं च समाप्तम् ॥ The alternate name for this work is Lakshmi-visishtadvaita- bhashya or more properly Sri-Vaikhanasiya- Lakshmi-Visishtadvaita- bhashya. There is a fairly elaborate gloss on this commentarial work 13 prepared by his disciple, Illattur Sundara-raja-Bhattacharya. This is known as Nigama-chuda-darpana (“The mirror to the crest-jewel of the Vedic corpus”). It ends with a devotional note : तेनास्मद् गुरूणा कृतस्य कृतिना प्रख्यातसत्कीर्तिना । भाष्यस्याशयमस्मि किं स्फुटयितुं सर्वं क्षमो मन्दधीः ॥ The glossator explains the concluding words of the commentator (इदं सर्व समञ्जसं प्रीयतां वेङ्कटेश- ॥) thus : इदं भाष्यं परजिगीषया प्रयोजनान्तरापेक्षया न कृतम् । किन्तु श्रीवैखानस कुलदैवत श्रीवेङ्कटेशप्रीत्या एव यथा परम्परारब्धविदितं भावः ॥ And the final conclusion of the commentator, quoting Marichi, भगवान्मरीचिराह श्रीशास्त्रे ज्ञानकाण्डे समूर्तार्चनमेव कारयेन्नान्यथा परमपदप्राप्तिरिति ॥ भगवान् बादरायणः प्राह भारते -’ सुरूपां प्रतिमां’ इत्यारभ्य ‘विशत्यपास्तदोषस्तु तामेव ब्रह्मरुपिणीम्॥’ इति । ‘तमेव चार्चयन्नित्यं भक्त्या पुरूषमव्ययम् ।’ इत्यारभ्य ‘सर्वदुः खातिगो भवेत् ॥’ इति इदं सर्वं समञ्जसम्॥ has been explained by the glossator. समूर्तार्चनमेवेति तदेव परमोपाय इत्यर्थः । एतच्छास्त्रकार एव भगवान् । पाराशर्यः. भगवत्समाराधनं मुक्त्युपायमुक्तवान् । अतोऽत्र न शङ्का कार्येत्यभिप्रायः । जन्मादिनिखिलदुःखनिवृत्तः इत्यर्थम् । उक्तेष्वर्थेषु न किञ्चिदप्यप्रमाणम् । अतः सर्वमभ्यर्हितमित्यर्थः ॥ This brings out in bold relief the purpose of this commentary. It is to highlight the indispensable value of iconic worship (samurta archana), which is traditionally regarded as the crown of jnana-kanda, both as a religious practice and as a spiritual expedient. The commentator and the glossator attempt to defend this position valiantly by bringing together a large mass of Vedic passages (mostly from the Upanishads) in support. The commentator quotes extensively from Paramatmikopanishad (on which text also he was written a commentary) and from Marichi’s Vimanarchana kalpa. The commentarial style closely follows the Purva-mimamsa methodology of pointing out the subject-matter (vishaya), raising doubts (visaya), suggesting prima facie arguments (purva-paksha), rebutting them with counter-arguments and establishing the correct position (siddhanta or raddhanta), and explaining the connection between topics (sangati). 14 The Bhashya opens with an invocatory varse dedicated to the commentator’s tutellary deity (kuladaiva), who is also the chosen deity for service (ishtadaiva), Venkatesvara of the Vengadam hill- shrine: निरुपमगुणसिन्धुर्नित्यलक्ष्मी समेतो निखिलनिगमवेद्यो निस्तुलो वेङ्कटेशः । निजचरणसमर्चासक्तभक्तौघरक्षी निवसतु हृदये मे स्वाङ्घ्रिभक्तिं वितन्वन् ॥ It may be remembered that Ramanuja also offers the invocatory prayer to the same deity (called here Srinivasa) at the commencement of his Sribhashya. The two prayers are very similar in intent, and emphasize the Lord’s role as the protector of all beings, his knowability through scriptures, and the incomparable value of devotion (bhakti). Srinivasa-makhin’s verse, however, adds an important detail, distinguishing the Vaikhanasa approach from other approaches; that the deity is ever associated with Lakshmi (’nitya Lakshmisametah’). This is what distinguishes this visishtadvaita (‘qualified Brahman’) from Ramanuja’s Visishtadvaita (which refers to Brahman as being qualified by Chetana and achetana, ‘chi-achid- visishta’, as his body), The supreme reality in the Vaikhanasa *approach is Brahman (Vishnu or Narayana), who contains within himself inseparably the element of Lakshmi. लक्ष्मीविशिष्टः नारायणः अद्वैत यत्र मते तल्लक्ष्मीविशिष्टाद्वैतम् ॥ The advaita here is non-difference between Narayana and Lakshmi. It is sometimes wrongly construed that the Vaikhanasa doctrine is borrowed from the Visishtadvaita of Ramanuja. Here is what Sundara-raja has to say on this point: अनेकचिद् विबुधा मन्यन्ते सर्वमस्मदीयमतम् श्रीरामानुजदृष्टान्न भिद्यतेऽत्रेति तच्च नात्युचितम् ॥ १ ॥ श्री श्रीनिवासगुरवो वैलक्षण्यं ततः पृथग्रन्थैः । वैखानसस्य विशदं कथयन्त्येव स्वतश्च महिमानम् ॥ २ ॥ भक्तिं परं हि मन्यते मोक्षोपायं महान्स यतिराजः । विखना भगवान्प्राह च भक्त्या वरमस्य पूजनं परमम् ॥ ३ ॥ ब्रूते तथैव भगवान्मोक्षोपायं स्फुटं मरीचिश्च । सिद्धान्तयति हि तद्वच्छुद्धात्मा श्रीनिवास- मखिराजः ॥ ४ ॥ कथयति यतिकुलराजो न पाञ्चरात्रे त्रयीविरोध इति । अध्वरिराजोऽस्माकं सध्वनि तत्राह तद्विरोधं हि ॥ १ ॥ । 1 Two points of difference have been noted here: (1) While for Ramanuja devotion (bhakti) is sufficient means for salvation, the Veikhanasa-satra insists that worship with devotion (pujana, 15 archana, samradhana) is that means; (2) For Ramanuja, the division of Agama known as Pancharatra is valid, while for the Vaikhanasa system it is not. It must be noted that the concept of Lakshmi, accepted in Visishtadvaita, is typically the Panchartra view, whereas the idea of Lakshmi in Lakshmi-visishtadvaita relies heavily on Paramatmikopanishat. Lakshmi in the chid-achid-visishta-advaita frame-work, is for practical purposes, and in line with Lakshmi- tantra, an independent deity with her own purushakaratva, upayatva and upeyatva (the akara-traya); she becomes owned by Vishnu, out of her own will: स्वतः श्रीः स्त्वं विष्णोः स्वमसि । as Parasara-bhatta describes and Vishnu become relevant only as the spouse of Vishnu : भवती सम्बन्धदृष्टया हरिं पश्येम । (ef Srigunaratnakosa and Kuresa’s Sri stava). Infact, Vishnu creates the world only at Lakshmi’s suggestion, which is binding on him: यस्या वीक्ष्य मुखं तदिङ्गितपराधीनो विधत्तेऽखिलं क्रीडेयं खलु । In the Vaikhanasa framework, Vishnu (more often called Narayana) is supreme, not dependent on Lakshmi in any detail or in any manner. She is, however, inseparably united with him and whatever is the attribute of Narayana (like the power to create, to pervade everywhere, being comprended in isvara-koti, and having all things and beings as her body), Lakshmi shares in it. In fact, one cannot think of Narayana without Lakshmi. The supreme reality is unitary, it is Lakshmi-narayana. In this sense, he is described as Lakshmi-visishta-advaita. I give below the English translation of excerpts from Rompicherla Parthasarathi-bhattar’s Sanskrit commentary on Marichi’s Ananda-samhita (chapter 15, PP: 267 cf., Vaikhanasa- granthamala series, 12, Igavari-palem, 1924) to illustrate the Vaikhanasa view of Lakshmi as viseshya of Narayana. “The Bhashyakara (viz. Srinivasa-makhin) has opined that Lakshmi who is the mother of the universe must be the first object of 16 our devotion, for she is the purushakara, and then Narayana alone as associated with Lakshmi must be worshipped. Marichi’s Vimanarchana-kalpa (jnana-kanda) says that Lakhmi is the extraordinary power (vibhuti) of Vishnu, eternal, devoid of origin or end, altogether beyond our means of knowing, in perfect accordance of Vishnu’s will, of the nature of immutable and immaculate bliss: she is energy (sakti) of the nature of primordial substance (mula- prakrti). She is the supreme power of Vishnu, whom the scriptures define as satyam, jnanam and anantam. She is called Sri, for she is resorted to as the refuge by all creatures. She can be known only on scriptural authority (sruti). She assumes all forms that Vishnu assumes, in accordance with Vishnu’s will. Vishnu’s all-pervasiveness is shared by her. They are indistinguishable like the power and the person who has that power. As Vishnu-purana says: त्वयेदं विष्णुना चाम्ब जगद्व्याप्तं चराचरम् ॥ Therefore the first tattva is Narayana as qualified by Lakshmi : ततो लक्ष्मीविशिष्टस्यैव परमपुरुषस्य प्रथमत्त्वभावः सम्पद्यते । They are related like prakrti and purusha, maya and mayin; no distinction can be made between them. In fact, the Lord himself assumes the feminine form as Sri, and is ever qualified by it. His power of creation is calle prakrti, for it is said: जगदुत्पादिका शक्तिस्तव प्रकृतिरिष्यते ॥ That is why in Vishnusahasra-nama, Vishnu is himself called Lakshmi and Sri.” That is why in the Vaikhasana approach, the conclusion is that it is only Narayana as inseparably associated with Lakshmi that is the protector लक्ष्म्या विशिष्ट एव पुरुषोत्तमः शरण्य इति परमो सिद्धान्तः ॥ When Narayana is resorted to as his refuge by the devotee, it is only as Lakshmi-narayana. Lakshmi represents the Lord’s compassion. लक्ष्म्या सह हृषीकेशो देव्या कारुण्यरूपया । रक्षकः सर्वसिद्धान्ते वेदान्तेषु च गीयते ॥ 17 If Narayana is ‘Isvara’, Lakshmi, is his ‘aisvarya’. The glossator Sundara-raja concludes his work summing up the purpose with which the Sariraka-sutras were compiled: एतच्छास्रकार एव भगवान् पाराशर्यः भगवत्समाराधनं मुक्त्युपायमुक्तवान् । अतोऽत्र न शङ्का कार्येत्यभिप्रायः । उक्तेष्वर्येषु न किञ्चिदप्यप्रमाणम् । अतः सर्वमभ्यर्हमित्यर्थः ॥ This is the most significant detail of the Vaikhanasa approach: The insistence on worship (iconic in nature) as the sole means of salvation. This is in sharp difference to other approaches, like Advaita which commends jnana (knowledge), Visishtadvaita which highlights the role of Bhakti (devotion), and Dvaita which suggests a judicious combination of both. While the Vaikhanasa outlook as crystallized in Lakshmi Visishtadvaita, recognizes the utility of both jnana and bhakti in leading us towards liberation, it holds actual worship as the culmination of jnana as well of bhakti. It relies on the Upanishadic passage (Mundaka): आत्मक्रीडा आत्मरतिः क्रियावानेष ब्रह्मविदां वरिष्ठः ॥ One who realizes Brahman through knowledge is Brahma- vit, and the one who realized Brahman through devotion is superior to Brahma-vit; he is Brahmavid-vara. But one engages himself in action (viz. worship) is the highest among the knowers of Brahman. He sports with Brahman who is his own self, by making iconic representation of the Brahman and offering worship to it (atma-krida). he dwells in the Brahman in loving devotion and adoration (atma- rati). The expression ‘kriya’ here refers to the worship facilitated by devotion (bhakti-sahakrta-bhagavad-aradhana). However, worship (aradhana, upasana) is different from devotion (bhakti, prapatti). क्रिया जपामूर्ताराधनसमूर्ताराधनक्रिया । (recitation of God’s name; worship in fire; worship through; which is devoid of fixed form, also called ‘huta’, fire-rituals; and iconic worship). Worship is the best form of brahma-vidya, where the word ‘vidya’ (literally meaning knowledge) means only the worship of God. विद्याशब्देन भगवदाराधनमेवोच्यते ॥ It is superior to knowing, and also to devotion. Hence it is called ‘uttama-brahma-vidya’ (the title of an independent work by Srinivasa-makhin). Its superiority (uttamatva) is also indicated when the four forms of worship are considered: (1) mental (manasika, viz. 18 japa), (2) fire rituals like agni- hotra; (3) iconic worship (bimbara- dhana); (4) and contemplation on Brahman beyond from (abimba- pujana). The mental worship and fire-rituals (huta) become capable of yielding fruits only when iconic worship is resorted either at the beginning or at the end. It is only after iconic worship, contemplation on the formless Brahman is possible. The four forms of worship may be practised in isolation (svatantryena) or together (samuchchita). Brahman has two aspects, as Srinivasa-makhin explains : with form (sakala) and without form (nishkala), as Marichi points out in the Yoga-Kanda of the Vimanarchanakalpa. ‘With form’ means having identifiable details or organs, manifested in the objects or transactional existence, and therefore knowable. ‘Without form’ is beyond the pale of our normal experience. Both, however, are ’natural’ (‘ubhayam api svabhavikam’). Even as fire is hidden unseen in fuel, oil in the sesame-seed, or juice in the fruit, but comes out in manifest form when the fuel is lit. sesame-seed is pressed, or the fruit is squeezed. The understanding of Brahman as having both these aspects is true knowledge (jnana); सम्यक्ज्ञानं नाम भगवतः निष्कलसकलस्वरूपविभागाराधन प्रकारादि ज्ञानम्॥ It is for the sake of worship that the formless and all-pervasive Brahman assumes specific iconic form as a result of special mental effort of the devotee (bhavana-viseshat), and having so assumed the form, he fulfils the longings of the devotees. तत्र परब्रह्मणः स्वभावः निष्कलः सकलश्च । निष्कलत्वं निरवयत्वम्। सकलत्वं सावयवत्वम् । एतदुभयमपि तस्य स्वाभाविकमित्यर्थः । नीरूपस्य सर्वव्यापकस्य विष्णोः साकारतयाऽविर्भावः ।… भावनाविशेषात् सकलः भवति । सकलस्वरूप एव स्वोपासकानामभीष्टं कुरुते ॥ It is only after worshipping Vishnu in both these forms, one after the other, that the devotee will accomplish his union (yoga) with Vishnu. Srinivasa-makhin in his Jijnasadhikarana-bhashya explains Marichi’s view thus : अस्मिन्नेव जन्मनि मोक्षकाङ्क्षिणां अनुष्ठेयप्रकारमाह- सगुणे ब्रह्मणि बुद्धिं निवेश्य पश्चान्निर्गुणमाश्रित्य इति । अयमर्थः । सगुणे सावयवे । ब्रह्मणि प्रतिमारूपे परमपुरुषे बुद्धिं भक्तिरुपाम् । निवेश्य तद्रूपं दृष्ट्वा तद्रतमानसः सन् । परं ब्रह्मैव एवं स्वरूपं जातमिति निश्चिन्वन् । पश्चात् । निर्गुणं निरवयम् ओङ्कारगम्यं अव्यक्तं ब्रह्म । आश्रित्य मनः प्रापय्य तद्रूपः ध्यात्वा । नित्यं आमोक्षान्तम् । एवं मोक्षे यत्नं उद्योगं कुर्यात् । तस्य योगिनः इह जन्मन्येव मोक्षो भवेत् ॥ 19 Two steps of worship are indicated here: (1) an intensely devotional approach to the iconic form of a personal deity; and (2) contemplation upon the Brahman as devoid of attributes or forms. The two are not sequentially prescribed. They must be resorted to simultaneously, According to Srinivasa-makhin: भगवदाराधन-निर्गुणाश्रयण मोक्षयत्नानां न सक्रमिकत्वम्। किन्तु यौगपद्यमेव faf That is why that the devotee even in the first step is asked not only to fix his mind steadily on the iconic form, but must convince himself that the Brahman himself, although devoid of form, has assumed this particular form for the sake of the devotee. This procedure of contemplating on the iconic form of Vishnu by the devotee turning his entire mind in that direction, and also holding on to the formless aspect, devoid of all qualities, but capable of being apprehended by the pranava (om) and thus making the mind wholly tranquil, must be considered in the light of Marichi’s prescription (patala, 89): अथातो ध्यानं वक्ष्ये, परमात्मनो जीवात्मना चिन्तनं ध्यानम् । निष्कलं सकलमिति तद् द्विविधम् । निष्कलं देवैरपि अनभिलक्ष्यम् अदृश्यं स्यात् । सकलं द्विविधं निर्गुणं सगुणं चेति । निर्गुणं निष्कलस्वभावः परमात्मनोऽन्यन्न किञ्चिदस्तीति । काष्टेऽग्निरिव सर्वं व्याप्य आकाशोपमः सर्वेषां आत्मगुहायां निहितः अन्तर्बहिश्च संस्थितो दृश्यादृश्य स्थूलसूक्ष्मोऽत्यच्छोऽप्रमेयो निरुद्योगोऽचिन्त्यो निष्कलः ॥ This leads us on to a consideration of the final goal that the Sariraka-mimamsa-sutra holds before us, as interpreted by Srinivasa- makhin in his Lakshmi-Visishtadvaita-bhashya. The purpose of all spritual enterprise is moksha, liberation from the cycle of birth and death, emancipation from phenomenal fetters. According to Marichi (patala 80), moksha is getting released from all latent impressions leading us to be fettered by transmigration. संसारबन्धनवासनान्मुक्तिः मोक्षः । This has a negative aspect, release from phenomenal constraints (samsara-mukti), and also a positive aspect, abinding in or with Brahman (brahmana sahasthitih). The second aspect is contingent upon the first, for as Srinivasa-makhin points out संसारमुक्तस्यैव ब्रह्मणा सहस्थितिः ॥ Jnana and Bhakti are helpful in accomplishing the first aspect, the elimination of ignorance (avidya) 20 and tendeny to return to the world (maya), whereas Aradhana will secure the second, for it has been said (Marichi, patala 80 ) : तदाराधनेन संसारार्णवनिमग्नो जीवात्मा परमात्मानं नारायणं पश्यति । सोऽप्यपुनरावृत्तिकं दिव्यलोकं प्रापयति । पश्चात् कृतकृत्यो भवति ॥ That Srinivasa-makhin explains jnana concerning Brahman (brahma-jnana) does not consist merely of the knowledge of scriptural import (vedanta-vakyartha-jnana ), but it is of the nature of worship; scriptural knowledge assuming the form of devotion only when knowledge takes the form of worship (upasanatmaka-jnana), avidya (nescience that binds us to the phenomenal fetters) is removed (avidya-nivrtti ). Jnana should naturally be transformed as Bhakti, if avidya is to be removed. But this does not secure salvation. For that purpose to be fulfilled, Bhakti should be reinforced by actual worship. यतो भक्तिमात्ररूपं उपासनं केवलं अविद्यानिवृित्तये भवति । तत्सहित भगवदाराधनं तु भगवत्पदप्राप्तौ अव्यवहितोपाय इति निश्चीयते । तथाह भगवान् मरीचिः भक्त्या भगवन्तं श्रीमन्नारायणमर्चयेत् । तद्विष्णोः परमं पदं गच्छतीति विज्ञायते’ इति ॥ शरीरत्व The Vaikhanasa view is that Jnana and Bhakti are intended only to supplement Aradhana; they are only ancillaries to worship. In the words of the glossator: भक्तिज्ञानयोः आराधनस्य च परस्परं उपस्कार्योपस्कारकभावसम्बन्धः । तेन भक्तिज्ञाने आराधनस्य अङ्गभूते ॥ The positive aspect of moksha consists of four divine planes of released existence for the devotee : (1) Salokya (obtainment of bliss of the first degree, amoda ), ( 2 ) Samipya (obtainment of the bliss of the higher degree, pramoda), (3) Sarupya (obtainment of still higher form of bliss known as sammoda) and ( 4 ) Sayujya (or Vaikuntha). There is this gradation of bliss (ananda-taratamya) in moksha. The devotees who work through devotion and knowledge (bhakti and jnana) become eligible to reach the first three planes. However, the final plane is obtained only by those who worship with devotion and knowledge. भक्त्यादिभिरुपासकानां आमोदादि लोकप्राप्तिः । वैकुण्ठप्राप्तिस्तु ज्ञानभक्ति सहकृतं आराधनं कुर्वतामेव ॥21 The four divine planes are reached by those who resort to worship of Brahman with form (sakalopasana), whereas those who take to the worship of the formless Brahman (nishkalopasana) get merged with Brahman, inseparably and irrevocably (atyantika-laya in Brahman). Srinivasa-makhin notes that there are many definitions for the word ‘moksha’ or liberation. (cf Jijnasadhikarana). He cites Marichi’s definition that it is release from transmigration (‘samaran muktih’). The glossator points out that Nrsimha-vajapeyi in his commentary on Vaikhanasa-sutra has another definition : ever abiding with Brahman in the form of supreme bliss: परमानन्दस्वरूपेण ब्रह्मणा सहात्यन्तावस्थानमेव मोक्षः ॥ This can happen only when one gets released from the phenomenal fetters. Thus ‘samsara-mukti’ is synonymous with ‘brahmana saha sthitih’. -6- Lakshmi-visishtadvaita-bhashya has thus many novel ideas to contribute to the general Vedantic thought. It provides valuable visighats into Siddhanta and Sampradaya, in sharp contrast to many other bhashyas. The text puts iconic worship and temple-culture on sound theoretical foundation. The main theses of this work may now be recapituated and summarized: (1) Tattva (tasya bhavahtattvam) primarily refers to the supreme Brahman (also called Narayana) as the cause of all the universe (sarva-jagat-karana). This is always associated with Lakshmi as power and compassion; and it is only thus that Godhead must be approached : लक्ष्मीविशिष्ट एवैकः प्रपत्तव्य इहोदितः ॥ (2) It (Lakshmi-Narayana) is itself the instrumental cause (nimitta-karana) as well as the material cause (upadana-karana) of the universe जगदुपादानत्वं निमित्तत्वं च एकस्य ब्रह्मण एवावगम्यते ॥ जगत्सिसृक्षोः ब्रह्मणः उपादानत्वम् ॥ The cause of the universe is known by the word Brahman. जगत्कारणं ब्रह्मशब्देन निर्दिश्यते ॥ 22 (3) Brahman is both sakala and nishkala (with form and without form); both are natural to Brahman. And there is nothing other than this. परब्रह्मणः स्वभाव- निष्कलः सकलश्च । अतोऽन्यन्न किञ्चिदस्ति ॥ (4) Brahman is distinct from the universe in which he abides as the inner principle even as butter in milk, oil in the sesame seed, fragrance in the flower, juice in the fruit, or fire in fuel. Pervading inside and outside of all things, Brahman is like formless and subtle sky. जगद्ब्रह्मणोः भेदोऽस्ति इत्याशयः प्रतिपादितः । क्षीरे सर्पिः तिले तैलं पुष्पे गन्धः फले रसः काष्ठे अग्निरिवान्तर्बहिश्च तत्सर्वं व्याप्याकाशोपमः ॥ (5) The souls as knowers of Brahman are different from the Brahman who is known by the souls. परमात्मनः जीवात्मानः भिन्ना इत्याशयो व्यञ्जिातो भवति । ज्ञेयाद्वस्तुनो ज्ञातुर्भिन्न इत्यस्यावश्याभ्युगन्तव्यात् ॥ (6) The universe which consists of living beings and non-living things is the body of Brahman. परमात्मनः चिदचिद्रूपशरीरविशिष्टत्वम् ॥ (7) The Brahman is eternal, immutable, all-powerful and the veritable abode of all endless and unsurpassed auspicious attributes. नित्यनिरतिशयानन्तकल्याणगुणाकरत्वं प्रत्यपादि ॥ (8) Knowledge (jnana ) of Brahman does not end with understanding the scriptural import; it must flower into devotion (bhakti) and only then the nescience (avidya) which is the source of phenomenal existence is removed. Only intense application to realizing Brahman (upasana) can be called knowledge, which will remove nescience. ब्रह्मज्ञानमिति न केवलं वेदान्तवाक्यार्थज्ञानम्। किन्तु तन्मूल भगवभ्दक्तिरूपो- पासनात्मकमिति ज्ञायते । वाक्यार्थज्ञानमात्रेण अविद्यानिवृत्तिश्च न भवति । परं तु तन्मूलकोपासनात्मकज्ञानेन अविद्यानिवृत्तिर्भवति ॥ (9) One who seeks liberation must worship the Godhead, accompanied by jnana and bhakti. 23 ज्ञानभक्तिभ्यामरहितेन मुमुक्षुणा मोक्षान्तं समाराधनरूपभगवदुपासनं कार्यमिति प्रत्यपादि ॥ (10) Devotion is important, although by itself is cannot lead to the ultimate goal. It is only worship that can thus lead the devotee to liberation. But devotion becomes important only when it is accompanied by knowledge. ज्ञानेन सहकृतभक्तेः एव प्राधान्यम् ॥ (11) Bhakti together with jnana is related to worship as an aid, limb or part thereof भक्तिज्ञानयोः आराधनस्य च परस्परं उपस्कार्योपस्कारकभाव सम्बन्धम्। तेन भक्तिज्ञाने आराधनस्य अङ्गभूते ॥ (12) Complete and wholesome knowledge consists in understanding the sakala and nishkala aspects of Brahman, and worshipping the Godhead in both aspects. सम्यक्ज्ञानं नाम भगवतः निष्कल सकल स्वरूपविभागाराधनम् ॥ (13) Liberation is freedom from the fetters of phenomenal existence संसारबन्धनान्मुक्तिः मोक्षः ॥ It is not merely nagative in nature. It also means ever abiding with Brahman in a state of supreme and everlasting bliss. परमानन्दस्वरूपेण ब्रह्मणा सहात्यन्तावस्थानमेव मोक्षः ॥ (14) Worship of the Godhead is the one and the only means for obtaining such liberation. भगवदाराधनस्य एकोपायत्वं, भगवन्तं नाऽन्यथा प्राप्नोतीति विज्ञायते ॥ (15) By worship of the sakala aspect of the Godhead, one obtains the four planes of liberation : salokya (obtainment of amoda), samipya (promoda) sarupya (sammoda) and sayujya (vaikuntha). The first three planes are reached by worship done with devotion, while the final plane is reached by worship done with devotion reinforced by knowledge. There is thus a gradation of bliss in liberation (ananda- taratamya) : आमोद प्रमोद सम्मोदवैकुण्ठभेदेन चतुर्धा स्थिताः भगवल्लोकाः । भक्त्यादिभिरुपासकानां आमोदादिप्राप्तिः स्यात् । वैकुण्ठप्रप्तिस्तु ज्ञानभक्ति सहकृतं आराधनं कुर्वतामेव ॥ 24 By worshipping the Nishkala aspect, one gets finally and indistinguishably dissolved in Brahman. निष्कलोपासनेन ब्रह्मणि आत्यन्तिकलयः ॥ (16) Liberation is characterized by eternal bliss, and it is ever- satisfying, as if one has partaken of ambrosia; it is abiding ever with the supreme Spirit; it means entry into the supreme light, and it is an experience without a break of the highest quarter of Vishnu- तच्च नित्यानन्दं अमृतरसपानवत् सदा तृप्तिकरं, परमात्मनो नित्यनिषेवणं, परञ्ज्योतिः प्रवेशनम् । ‘तद्विष्णोः परमं पदं सदा पश्यन्ति सूरयः, इति श्रुतिः ॥ (17) By worship is here meant only iconic worship. आराधनमिह समूर्तार्चनमेव विवक्षितम् ॥ Installing an image of Vishnu at home or in the temple and worshipping it in the Vedic mode. गृहे देवायतने वा वैदिकमार्गेण पूजनं तदर्चनम् ॥ (18) Liberation in this very life is made possible by first resorting to iconic worship, and following it up with the worship of Nishkala-Brahman. अस्मिन् जन्मन्येव मोक्षकाङ्क्षिणां अनुष्ठानप्रकारमाह ।">

  <meta itemprop="description" content="Prof. S.K. RAMACHANDRA RAO Included in the celebrated Vedantic triad known as Prasthanatraya is the Sutra-compendium (called variously Vedanta- sutras, Sariraka sutras, Sariraka-mimamsa-sutras, Brahma-sutras, Vaiyasika-sutras and Uttara-mimamsa-sutras), ascribed to Badarayana or Vyasa (son of Parasara, hence Parasarya), the other two being the Upanishads (properly called the Vedanta) and the Bhagavad Gita. The Sutra-text is described as Nyaya-prasthana, as it tries to examine the existence and nature of Brahman vis a vis the world in a rational context, with arguments and counter-arguments, with doubts raised and cleared, and with suggestions for a final and incontrovertible conclusion (the sutra’s main function being to suggest conclusions, ‘suchanat-sutram’). It seeks to present a cogent, consistent and intellectually edifying account of the Upanishadic philosophy (hence called Vedanta-sutras), and its merit consists in the analytical spirit and the methodological approach of inquiry and examination (which the expression, mimamsa, really means). It is aphoristic in nature (sutra-style), and the text consists of short, cryptic and suggestive groups of words. The well-known definition of the sutra is that it contains but few words (alpaksharam), which are unambiguous (asandigdham), and suggestive of a world of meanings (saravad visvato-mukham). However, the rigorous economy of the words, coupled with the highly suggestive character of the arrangement of the words, has resulted in a variety of interpretations. While the nature of the literary structure of the Sutra-compendium as containing a large number of topics or adhikaranas arranged in four chapters or adhyayas, each having four sections (or padas) is universally accepted, the number of aphorisms and topics are not unanimously given by the commentators on the text. The earliest commentator is Samkara (632-644 A.D.), whose approach to the Sutra has been described as unqualified non-dualism (nirviseshadvaita). It must be remembered that Badarayana was not 10 the only Sutra-kara, although his work it is that has survived till this day. He himself has mentioned the names and views of some of the earlier sutra-karas, like Asmarathya, Kasakrtsna, Audulomi, Badari and Jaimini (not the author of the Purvamimamsa-sutra). The differences among the commentators may be due to the survival of the views of these earlier sutra-karas. Samkara, for instance, upholds the views of Kasartsna. Samkara who hailed from South India takes the text of Badarayana as consisting of 555 aphorisms, (sutras) and 191 topics (adhikaranas). Bhaskara, who came after him (around 1000 A.D), and interpreted the text as favouring the Aupadhika Bhedabheda (conditional dualism and non-dualism) view, took the text as consisting of 534 sutras and 140 adhikaranas, For Ramanuja (1017- 1150) whose Sri-bhashya on the text favoured the Visishtadvaita (qualified non-dualism) view, the text had 545 sutras and 140 adhikaranas. Anandatirtha (1238-1317), whose commentary on the text is known as Brahma sutra-bhashya, projected the Dvaita (pluralism and realism) view on the text, which according to him consists of 534 sutras and 123 adhikaranas. These three viewpoints (excluding Bhaskara’s) are widely prevalent in the country to this day, and they have been explained by numerous glosses and annotations over the years. Among other commentaries on the text may be mentioned the vedanta-parijata of Nimbarka (around 1250 A.D.) of Central India, whose text consists of 549 sutras and 161 adhikaranas and who favoured the Dvaitadvaita viewpoint; the Saiva-bhashya of Srikantha (around 1270 A.D.) from Kashmir, who interpreted the text (of 544 sutras and 182 adhikaranas) in the Saiva-visishtadvaita context; the Srikara-bhashya of Sripati (around 1400 A.D.) who favoured the Sakti-Visishtadvaita View point; the Anubhashya of Vallabha (around 1500 A.D.) of Gujarat, which takes the text as consisting of 554 sutras and 171 adhikaranas and as favouring the Suddhadvaita viewpoint; the Vijnanamrta-bhashya of Vijnana-bhikshu (around 1600 A.D.), projecting the Avibhagadvaita view; and the Govinda-bhashya of Baladeva (around 1725) supporting the Achintya-bhedabheda doctrine. While these commentaries have come down to us, there are many which have been lost. Among the references available, we find that Yadavaprakasa, who lived after Bhaskara and before Ramanuja (or rather during Ramanuja’s days)11 had written a commentary, now no longer extant, upholding the view of Svabhavikabhedabheda (natural dualism and non-dualism), modifying Bhaskara’s view. A commentary that is little known but is of great importance is called Lakshmi-visishtadvaita (of Sri-visishtadvaita) - bhashya prepared by Srinivasa-makhin (Srinivasa-dikshita, Srinivasadhvari) of the Vaikhanasa tradition, which is the hoary antiquity. The name ‘Visishtadvaita’ was brought into vogue by the work of Ramanuja- charya (1017-1150), who however called his own commentary on the Sariraka-sutras Sri-bhashya. The expression ‘visishta’ (meaning “qualified”) associated with ‘advaita’ (the one, without a second as the sole reality) refers here to the Brahman having the sentient and insentient orders of existence as his own body (chidachid-prakara). We do not find the expression Visishtadvaita in Atri’s Samurtarchadhikarana or Bhrgu’s Prakirnadhikara as signifying the Vaikhanasa viewpoint. Srinivasa-mukhin specifies that the Brahman (Narayana) is invariably associated with Lakshmi, and that it is in this sense that he is ‘visishta’. Thus Ramanuja’s Visishtadvaita, is not the same as the Vaikhanasa Visishtadvaita which Srinivasa- makhin expounded, as it is commonly misconceived. The Vaikhanasa viewpoint had been prevailing from very ancient times, and even the Alwars were acquainted with it, long before the days of Ramanuja. It is not unlikely therefore that Ramanuja was to some extent influenced by the Vaikhanasa approach to divinity and Deity. This may explain the similarity of ideas that we find in Sribhashya and Lakshmi-visishtadvaita-bhashya. It is not to be construed that the latter borrowed from the former. The differences in the approaches are too conspicuous to be ignored. They will be indicated later. Ilattur Sundara-raja-Bhattacharya, who claims to be a student of Srinivasa-makhin (’natir me yam gurave’ stu tasmai’, 41), has written a short biogrophical account of his master, entitled ‘Srinivasa-dikshitendra-charitram’. He mentions here that Srinivasa- makhin was born in 4030 of the Kali-era (’trimsad-uttara-chatuhsah- asregha-vyatiteshu’), corresponding to about 1030 A.D. This would make him a junior contemporary of Ramanuja. The book also makes a specific reference to Srinivasa- makhin being earlier to Venkata- 12 natha who is celebrated as ‘Vedanta-Desika’ (b.1268). Srinivasa- makhin also had this title, as also ‘Sarvaranta-svatantra’ in common with Venkata-natha. According to the book, Srinivasa-makhin was the son of Govindacharya who was the chief priest of the hilt-shrine of Vengadam, the presentday Tirumala-Tirupati in Andhra Pradesh. The boy was invested with the sacred thread when he was five years old, and brought before the Venkatesvara image in the sanctum to begin his hereditary vocation as priest. He filled this position is later life with great devotion. It is probable that Ramanuja visited the shrine when Govindacharya was the priest, and that the two met. Srinivasa-makhin was unusually talented, and distinguished himself as a versatile scholar, poet and writer. He wrote many books, more than 25, all in Sanskrit to highlight the significance of the Vaikhanasa community to the religious traditions of the country. His works explain and vindicate the Vaikhanasa point of view regarding Siddhanta as well as Sampradaya. He was honoured widely. But he continued to serve as priest in the shrine of Venkatesvara all his life. Among his works, of particular interest to us here are his commentary on the Sariraka-sutra (Vedanta-sutra), a gloss an Paramatmikopanishad and an independent work called Uttamabrahma-vidya-sara. Sundara-raja’s biographical account also mentions that Srinivasa-makhin wrote a commentary on Valmiki Ramayana another on the Vaikhanasa-sutra, and some independent books like Tithinirnaya, Srauta-vishaya-prayaschitta and Vaikhanasa-mahima-manjari. He was also a staunch votary of Karmakanda, having performed all the prescribed paka-yajnas, havir- yajnas and soma-yaga. It was threfore that he was called ‘makhin’ (dikshita, adhvari). The work that is published now is his commentary (bhashya) on Badarayana’s Vedanta-sutra (Sariraka-sutra). The colophon to this work entitled Sri-visishtadvaita-bhashya reads: इति श्रीवेङ्कटेशपादाब्जसपर्यारत सर्वतन्त्रस्वतन्त्र श्रीर्वैखानसावतंस वेदान्तदेशिक श्रीनिवासमखीन्द्र विरचिते श्रीविशिष्टाद्वैतभाष्ये चतुर्थाध्यायस्य चतुर्थः पादः अध्यायश्च समाप्तः । शस्त्रं च समाप्तम् ॥ The alternate name for this work is Lakshmi-visishtadvaita- bhashya or more properly Sri-Vaikhanasiya- Lakshmi-Visishtadvaita- bhashya. There is a fairly elaborate gloss on this commentarial work 13 prepared by his disciple, Illattur Sundara-raja-Bhattacharya. This is known as Nigama-chuda-darpana (“The mirror to the crest-jewel of the Vedic corpus”). It ends with a devotional note : तेनास्मद् गुरूणा कृतस्य कृतिना प्रख्यातसत्कीर्तिना । भाष्यस्याशयमस्मि किं स्फुटयितुं सर्वं क्षमो मन्दधीः ॥ The glossator explains the concluding words of the commentator (इदं सर्व समञ्जसं प्रीयतां वेङ्कटेश- ॥) thus : इदं भाष्यं परजिगीषया प्रयोजनान्तरापेक्षया न कृतम् । किन्तु श्रीवैखानस कुलदैवत श्रीवेङ्कटेशप्रीत्या एव यथा परम्परारब्धविदितं भावः ॥ And the final conclusion of the commentator, quoting Marichi, भगवान्मरीचिराह श्रीशास्त्रे ज्ञानकाण्डे समूर्तार्चनमेव कारयेन्नान्यथा परमपदप्राप्तिरिति ॥ भगवान् बादरायणः प्राह भारते -’ सुरूपां प्रतिमां’ इत्यारभ्य ‘विशत्यपास्तदोषस्तु तामेव ब्रह्मरुपिणीम्॥’ इति । ‘तमेव चार्चयन्नित्यं भक्त्या पुरूषमव्ययम् ।’ इत्यारभ्य ‘सर्वदुः खातिगो भवेत् ॥’ इति इदं सर्वं समञ्जसम्॥ has been explained by the glossator. समूर्तार्चनमेवेति तदेव परमोपाय इत्यर्थः । एतच्छास्त्रकार एव भगवान् । पाराशर्यः. भगवत्समाराधनं मुक्त्युपायमुक्तवान् । अतोऽत्र न शङ्का कार्येत्यभिप्रायः । जन्मादिनिखिलदुःखनिवृत्तः इत्यर्थम् । उक्तेष्वर्थेषु न किञ्चिदप्यप्रमाणम् । अतः सर्वमभ्यर्हितमित्यर्थः ॥ This brings out in bold relief the purpose of this commentary. It is to highlight the indispensable value of iconic worship (samurta archana), which is traditionally regarded as the crown of jnana-kanda, both as a religious practice and as a spiritual expedient. The commentator and the glossator attempt to defend this position valiantly by bringing together a large mass of Vedic passages (mostly from the Upanishads) in support. The commentator quotes extensively from Paramatmikopanishad (on which text also he was written a commentary) and from Marichi’s Vimanarchana kalpa. The commentarial style closely follows the Purva-mimamsa methodology of pointing out the subject-matter (vishaya), raising doubts (visaya), suggesting prima facie arguments (purva-paksha), rebutting them with counter-arguments and establishing the correct position (siddhanta or raddhanta), and explaining the connection between topics (sangati). 14 The Bhashya opens with an invocatory varse dedicated to the commentator’s tutellary deity (kuladaiva), who is also the chosen deity for service (ishtadaiva), Venkatesvara of the Vengadam hill- shrine: निरुपमगुणसिन्धुर्नित्यलक्ष्मी समेतो निखिलनिगमवेद्यो निस्तुलो वेङ्कटेशः । निजचरणसमर्चासक्तभक्तौघरक्षी निवसतु हृदये मे स्वाङ्घ्रिभक्तिं वितन्वन् ॥ It may be remembered that Ramanuja also offers the invocatory prayer to the same deity (called here Srinivasa) at the commencement of his Sribhashya. The two prayers are very similar in intent, and emphasize the Lord’s role as the protector of all beings, his knowability through scriptures, and the incomparable value of devotion (bhakti). Srinivasa-makhin’s verse, however, adds an important detail, distinguishing the Vaikhanasa approach from other approaches; that the deity is ever associated with Lakshmi (’nitya Lakshmisametah’). This is what distinguishes this visishtadvaita (‘qualified Brahman’) from Ramanuja’s Visishtadvaita (which refers to Brahman as being qualified by Chetana and achetana, ‘chi-achid- visishta’, as his body), The supreme reality in the Vaikhanasa *approach is Brahman (Vishnu or Narayana), who contains within himself inseparably the element of Lakshmi. लक्ष्मीविशिष्टः नारायणः अद्वैत यत्र मते तल्लक्ष्मीविशिष्टाद्वैतम् ॥ The advaita here is non-difference between Narayana and Lakshmi. It is sometimes wrongly construed that the Vaikhanasa doctrine is borrowed from the Visishtadvaita of Ramanuja. Here is what Sundara-raja has to say on this point: अनेकचिद् विबुधा मन्यन्ते सर्वमस्मदीयमतम् श्रीरामानुजदृष्टान्न भिद्यतेऽत्रेति तच्च नात्युचितम् ॥ १ ॥ श्री श्रीनिवासगुरवो वैलक्षण्यं ततः पृथग्रन्थैः । वैखानसस्य विशदं कथयन्त्येव स्वतश्च महिमानम् ॥ २ ॥ भक्तिं परं हि मन्यते मोक्षोपायं महान्स यतिराजः । विखना भगवान्प्राह च भक्त्या वरमस्य पूजनं परमम् ॥ ३ ॥ ब्रूते तथैव भगवान्मोक्षोपायं स्फुटं मरीचिश्च । सिद्धान्तयति हि तद्वच्छुद्धात्मा श्रीनिवास- मखिराजः ॥ ४ ॥ कथयति यतिकुलराजो न पाञ्चरात्रे त्रयीविरोध इति । अध्वरिराजोऽस्माकं सध्वनि तत्राह तद्विरोधं हि ॥ १ ॥ । 1 Two points of difference have been noted here: (1) While for Ramanuja devotion (bhakti) is sufficient means for salvation, the Veikhanasa-satra insists that worship with devotion (pujana, 15 archana, samradhana) is that means; (2) For Ramanuja, the division of Agama known as Pancharatra is valid, while for the Vaikhanasa system it is not. It must be noted that the concept of Lakshmi, accepted in Visishtadvaita, is typically the Panchartra view, whereas the idea of Lakshmi in Lakshmi-visishtadvaita relies heavily on Paramatmikopanishat. Lakshmi in the chid-achid-visishta-advaita frame-work, is for practical purposes, and in line with Lakshmi- tantra, an independent deity with her own purushakaratva, upayatva and upeyatva (the akara-traya); she becomes owned by Vishnu, out of her own will: स्वतः श्रीः स्त्वं विष्णोः स्वमसि । as Parasara-bhatta describes and Vishnu become relevant only as the spouse of Vishnu : भवती सम्बन्धदृष्टया हरिं पश्येम । (ef Srigunaratnakosa and Kuresa’s Sri stava). Infact, Vishnu creates the world only at Lakshmi’s suggestion, which is binding on him: यस्या वीक्ष्य मुखं तदिङ्गितपराधीनो विधत्तेऽखिलं क्रीडेयं खलु । In the Vaikhanasa framework, Vishnu (more often called Narayana) is supreme, not dependent on Lakshmi in any detail or in any manner. She is, however, inseparably united with him and whatever is the attribute of Narayana (like the power to create, to pervade everywhere, being comprended in isvara-koti, and having all things and beings as her body), Lakshmi shares in it. In fact, one cannot think of Narayana without Lakshmi. The supreme reality is unitary, it is Lakshmi-narayana. In this sense, he is described as Lakshmi-visishta-advaita. I give below the English translation of excerpts from Rompicherla Parthasarathi-bhattar’s Sanskrit commentary on Marichi’s Ananda-samhita (chapter 15, PP: 267 cf., Vaikhanasa- granthamala series, 12, Igavari-palem, 1924) to illustrate the Vaikhanasa view of Lakshmi as viseshya of Narayana. “The Bhashyakara (viz. Srinivasa-makhin) has opined that Lakshmi who is the mother of the universe must be the first object of 16 our devotion, for she is the purushakara, and then Narayana alone as associated with Lakshmi must be worshipped. Marichi’s Vimanarchana-kalpa (jnana-kanda) says that Lakhmi is the extraordinary power (vibhuti) of Vishnu, eternal, devoid of origin or end, altogether beyond our means of knowing, in perfect accordance of Vishnu’s will, of the nature of immutable and immaculate bliss: she is energy (sakti) of the nature of primordial substance (mula- prakrti). She is the supreme power of Vishnu, whom the scriptures define as satyam, jnanam and anantam. She is called Sri, for she is resorted to as the refuge by all creatures. She can be known only on scriptural authority (sruti). She assumes all forms that Vishnu assumes, in accordance with Vishnu’s will. Vishnu’s all-pervasiveness is shared by her. They are indistinguishable like the power and the person who has that power. As Vishnu-purana says: त्वयेदं विष्णुना चाम्ब जगद्व्याप्तं चराचरम् ॥ Therefore the first tattva is Narayana as qualified by Lakshmi : ततो लक्ष्मीविशिष्टस्यैव परमपुरुषस्य प्रथमत्त्वभावः सम्पद्यते । They are related like prakrti and purusha, maya and mayin; no distinction can be made between them. In fact, the Lord himself assumes the feminine form as Sri, and is ever qualified by it. His power of creation is calle prakrti, for it is said: जगदुत्पादिका शक्तिस्तव प्रकृतिरिष्यते ॥ That is why in Vishnusahasra-nama, Vishnu is himself called Lakshmi and Sri.” That is why in the Vaikhasana approach, the conclusion is that it is only Narayana as inseparably associated with Lakshmi that is the protector लक्ष्म्या विशिष्ट एव पुरुषोत्तमः शरण्य इति परमो सिद्धान्तः ॥ When Narayana is resorted to as his refuge by the devotee, it is only as Lakshmi-narayana. Lakshmi represents the Lord’s compassion. लक्ष्म्या सह हृषीकेशो देव्या कारुण्यरूपया । रक्षकः सर्वसिद्धान्ते वेदान्तेषु च गीयते ॥ 17 If Narayana is ‘Isvara’, Lakshmi, is his ‘aisvarya’. The glossator Sundara-raja concludes his work summing up the purpose with which the Sariraka-sutras were compiled: एतच्छास्रकार एव भगवान् पाराशर्यः भगवत्समाराधनं मुक्त्युपायमुक्तवान् । अतोऽत्र न शङ्का कार्येत्यभिप्रायः । उक्तेष्वर्येषु न किञ्चिदप्यप्रमाणम् । अतः सर्वमभ्यर्हमित्यर्थः ॥ This is the most significant detail of the Vaikhanasa approach: The insistence on worship (iconic in nature) as the sole means of salvation. This is in sharp difference to other approaches, like Advaita which commends jnana (knowledge), Visishtadvaita which highlights the role of Bhakti (devotion), and Dvaita which suggests a judicious combination of both. While the Vaikhanasa outlook as crystallized in Lakshmi Visishtadvaita, recognizes the utility of both jnana and bhakti in leading us towards liberation, it holds actual worship as the culmination of jnana as well of bhakti. It relies on the Upanishadic passage (Mundaka): आत्मक्रीडा आत्मरतिः क्रियावानेष ब्रह्मविदां वरिष्ठः ॥ One who realizes Brahman through knowledge is Brahma- vit, and the one who realized Brahman through devotion is superior to Brahma-vit; he is Brahmavid-vara. But one engages himself in action (viz. worship) is the highest among the knowers of Brahman. He sports with Brahman who is his own self, by making iconic representation of the Brahman and offering worship to it (atma-krida). he dwells in the Brahman in loving devotion and adoration (atma- rati). The expression ‘kriya’ here refers to the worship facilitated by devotion (bhakti-sahakrta-bhagavad-aradhana). However, worship (aradhana, upasana) is different from devotion (bhakti, prapatti). क्रिया जपामूर्ताराधनसमूर्ताराधनक्रिया । (recitation of God’s name; worship in fire; worship through; which is devoid of fixed form, also called ‘huta’, fire-rituals; and iconic worship). Worship is the best form of brahma-vidya, where the word ‘vidya’ (literally meaning knowledge) means only the worship of God. विद्याशब्देन भगवदाराधनमेवोच्यते ॥ It is superior to knowing, and also to devotion. Hence it is called ‘uttama-brahma-vidya’ (the title of an independent work by Srinivasa-makhin). Its superiority (uttamatva) is also indicated when the four forms of worship are considered: (1) mental (manasika, viz. 18 japa), (2) fire rituals like agni- hotra; (3) iconic worship (bimbara- dhana); (4) and contemplation on Brahman beyond from (abimba- pujana). The mental worship and fire-rituals (huta) become capable of yielding fruits only when iconic worship is resorted either at the beginning or at the end. It is only after iconic worship, contemplation on the formless Brahman is possible. The four forms of worship may be practised in isolation (svatantryena) or together (samuchchita). Brahman has two aspects, as Srinivasa-makhin explains : with form (sakala) and without form (nishkala), as Marichi points out in the Yoga-Kanda of the Vimanarchanakalpa. ‘With form’ means having identifiable details or organs, manifested in the objects or transactional existence, and therefore knowable. ‘Without form’ is beyond the pale of our normal experience. Both, however, are ’natural’ (‘ubhayam api svabhavikam’). Even as fire is hidden unseen in fuel, oil in the sesame-seed, or juice in the fruit, but comes out in manifest form when the fuel is lit. sesame-seed is pressed, or the fruit is squeezed. The understanding of Brahman as having both these aspects is true knowledge (jnana); सम्यक्ज्ञानं नाम भगवतः निष्कलसकलस्वरूपविभागाराधन प्रकारादि ज्ञानम्॥ It is for the sake of worship that the formless and all-pervasive Brahman assumes specific iconic form as a result of special mental effort of the devotee (bhavana-viseshat), and having so assumed the form, he fulfils the longings of the devotees. तत्र परब्रह्मणः स्वभावः निष्कलः सकलश्च । निष्कलत्वं निरवयत्वम्। सकलत्वं सावयवत्वम् । एतदुभयमपि तस्य स्वाभाविकमित्यर्थः । नीरूपस्य सर्वव्यापकस्य विष्णोः साकारतयाऽविर्भावः ।… भावनाविशेषात् सकलः भवति । सकलस्वरूप एव स्वोपासकानामभीष्टं कुरुते ॥ It is only after worshipping Vishnu in both these forms, one after the other, that the devotee will accomplish his union (yoga) with Vishnu. Srinivasa-makhin in his Jijnasadhikarana-bhashya explains Marichi’s view thus : अस्मिन्नेव जन्मनि मोक्षकाङ्क्षिणां अनुष्ठेयप्रकारमाह- सगुणे ब्रह्मणि बुद्धिं निवेश्य पश्चान्निर्गुणमाश्रित्य इति । अयमर्थः । सगुणे सावयवे । ब्रह्मणि प्रतिमारूपे परमपुरुषे बुद्धिं भक्तिरुपाम् । निवेश्य तद्रूपं दृष्ट्वा तद्रतमानसः सन् । परं ब्रह्मैव एवं स्वरूपं जातमिति निश्चिन्वन् । पश्चात् । निर्गुणं निरवयम् ओङ्कारगम्यं अव्यक्तं ब्रह्म । आश्रित्य मनः प्रापय्य तद्रूपः ध्यात्वा । नित्यं आमोक्षान्तम् । एवं मोक्षे यत्नं उद्योगं कुर्यात् । तस्य योगिनः इह जन्मन्येव मोक्षो भवेत् ॥ 19 Two steps of worship are indicated here: (1) an intensely devotional approach to the iconic form of a personal deity; and (2) contemplation upon the Brahman as devoid of attributes or forms. The two are not sequentially prescribed. They must be resorted to simultaneously, According to Srinivasa-makhin: भगवदाराधन-निर्गुणाश्रयण मोक्षयत्नानां न सक्रमिकत्वम्। किन्तु यौगपद्यमेव faf That is why that the devotee even in the first step is asked not only to fix his mind steadily on the iconic form, but must convince himself that the Brahman himself, although devoid of form, has assumed this particular form for the sake of the devotee. This procedure of contemplating on the iconic form of Vishnu by the devotee turning his entire mind in that direction, and also holding on to the formless aspect, devoid of all qualities, but capable of being apprehended by the pranava (om) and thus making the mind wholly tranquil, must be considered in the light of Marichi’s prescription (patala, 89): अथातो ध्यानं वक्ष्ये, परमात्मनो जीवात्मना चिन्तनं ध्यानम् । निष्कलं सकलमिति तद् द्विविधम् । निष्कलं देवैरपि अनभिलक्ष्यम् अदृश्यं स्यात् । सकलं द्विविधं निर्गुणं सगुणं चेति । निर्गुणं निष्कलस्वभावः परमात्मनोऽन्यन्न किञ्चिदस्तीति । काष्टेऽग्निरिव सर्वं व्याप्य आकाशोपमः सर्वेषां आत्मगुहायां निहितः अन्तर्बहिश्च संस्थितो दृश्यादृश्य स्थूलसूक्ष्मोऽत्यच्छोऽप्रमेयो निरुद्योगोऽचिन्त्यो निष्कलः ॥ This leads us on to a consideration of the final goal that the Sariraka-mimamsa-sutra holds before us, as interpreted by Srinivasa- makhin in his Lakshmi-Visishtadvaita-bhashya. The purpose of all spritual enterprise is moksha, liberation from the cycle of birth and death, emancipation from phenomenal fetters. According to Marichi (patala 80), moksha is getting released from all latent impressions leading us to be fettered by transmigration. संसारबन्धनवासनान्मुक्तिः मोक्षः । This has a negative aspect, release from phenomenal constraints (samsara-mukti), and also a positive aspect, abinding in or with Brahman (brahmana sahasthitih). The second aspect is contingent upon the first, for as Srinivasa-makhin points out संसारमुक्तस्यैव ब्रह्मणा सहस्थितिः ॥ Jnana and Bhakti are helpful in accomplishing the first aspect, the elimination of ignorance (avidya) 20 and tendeny to return to the world (maya), whereas Aradhana will secure the second, for it has been said (Marichi, patala 80 ) : तदाराधनेन संसारार्णवनिमग्नो जीवात्मा परमात्मानं नारायणं पश्यति । सोऽप्यपुनरावृत्तिकं दिव्यलोकं प्रापयति । पश्चात् कृतकृत्यो भवति ॥ That Srinivasa-makhin explains jnana concerning Brahman (brahma-jnana) does not consist merely of the knowledge of scriptural import (vedanta-vakyartha-jnana ), but it is of the nature of worship; scriptural knowledge assuming the form of devotion only when knowledge takes the form of worship (upasanatmaka-jnana), avidya (nescience that binds us to the phenomenal fetters) is removed (avidya-nivrtti ). Jnana should naturally be transformed as Bhakti, if avidya is to be removed. But this does not secure salvation. For that purpose to be fulfilled, Bhakti should be reinforced by actual worship. यतो भक्तिमात्ररूपं उपासनं केवलं अविद्यानिवृित्तये भवति । तत्सहित भगवदाराधनं तु भगवत्पदप्राप्तौ अव्यवहितोपाय इति निश्चीयते । तथाह भगवान् मरीचिः भक्त्या भगवन्तं श्रीमन्नारायणमर्चयेत् । तद्विष्णोः परमं पदं गच्छतीति विज्ञायते’ इति ॥ शरीरत्व The Vaikhanasa view is that Jnana and Bhakti are intended only to supplement Aradhana; they are only ancillaries to worship. In the words of the glossator: भक्तिज्ञानयोः आराधनस्य च परस्परं उपस्कार्योपस्कारकभावसम्बन्धः । तेन भक्तिज्ञाने आराधनस्य अङ्गभूते ॥ The positive aspect of moksha consists of four divine planes of released existence for the devotee : (1) Salokya (obtainment of bliss of the first degree, amoda ), ( 2 ) Samipya (obtainment of the bliss of the higher degree, pramoda), (3) Sarupya (obtainment of still higher form of bliss known as sammoda) and ( 4 ) Sayujya (or Vaikuntha). There is this gradation of bliss (ananda-taratamya) in moksha. The devotees who work through devotion and knowledge (bhakti and jnana) become eligible to reach the first three planes. However, the final plane is obtained only by those who worship with devotion and knowledge. भक्त्यादिभिरुपासकानां आमोदादि लोकप्राप्तिः । वैकुण्ठप्राप्तिस्तु ज्ञानभक्ति सहकृतं आराधनं कुर्वतामेव ॥21 The four divine planes are reached by those who resort to worship of Brahman with form (sakalopasana), whereas those who take to the worship of the formless Brahman (nishkalopasana) get merged with Brahman, inseparably and irrevocably (atyantika-laya in Brahman). Srinivasa-makhin notes that there are many definitions for the word ‘moksha’ or liberation. (cf Jijnasadhikarana). He cites Marichi’s definition that it is release from transmigration (‘samaran muktih’). The glossator points out that Nrsimha-vajapeyi in his commentary on Vaikhanasa-sutra has another definition : ever abiding with Brahman in the form of supreme bliss: परमानन्दस्वरूपेण ब्रह्मणा सहात्यन्तावस्थानमेव मोक्षः ॥ This can happen only when one gets released from the phenomenal fetters. Thus ‘samsara-mukti’ is synonymous with ‘brahmana saha sthitih’. -6- Lakshmi-visishtadvaita-bhashya has thus many novel ideas to contribute to the general Vedantic thought. It provides valuable visighats into Siddhanta and Sampradaya, in sharp contrast to many other bhashyas. The text puts iconic worship and temple-culture on sound theoretical foundation. The main theses of this work may now be recapituated and summarized: (1) Tattva (tasya bhavahtattvam) primarily refers to the supreme Brahman (also called Narayana) as the cause of all the universe (sarva-jagat-karana). This is always associated with Lakshmi as power and compassion; and it is only thus that Godhead must be approached : लक्ष्मीविशिष्ट एवैकः प्रपत्तव्य इहोदितः ॥ (2) It (Lakshmi-Narayana) is itself the instrumental cause (nimitta-karana) as well as the material cause (upadana-karana) of the universe जगदुपादानत्वं निमित्तत्वं च एकस्य ब्रह्मण एवावगम्यते ॥ जगत्सिसृक्षोः ब्रह्मणः उपादानत्वम् ॥ The cause of the universe is known by the word Brahman. जगत्कारणं ब्रह्मशब्देन निर्दिश्यते ॥ 22 (3) Brahman is both sakala and nishkala (with form and without form); both are natural to Brahman. And there is nothing other than this. परब्रह्मणः स्वभाव- निष्कलः सकलश्च । अतोऽन्यन्न किञ्चिदस्ति ॥ (4) Brahman is distinct from the universe in which he abides as the inner principle even as butter in milk, oil in the sesame seed, fragrance in the flower, juice in the fruit, or fire in fuel. Pervading inside and outside of all things, Brahman is like formless and subtle sky. जगद्ब्रह्मणोः भेदोऽस्ति इत्याशयः प्रतिपादितः । क्षीरे सर्पिः तिले तैलं पुष्पे गन्धः फले रसः काष्ठे अग्निरिवान्तर्बहिश्च तत्सर्वं व्याप्याकाशोपमः ॥ (5) The souls as knowers of Brahman are different from the Brahman who is known by the souls. परमात्मनः जीवात्मानः भिन्ना इत्याशयो व्यञ्जिातो भवति । ज्ञेयाद्वस्तुनो ज्ञातुर्भिन्न इत्यस्यावश्याभ्युगन्तव्यात् ॥ (6) The universe which consists of living beings and non-living things is the body of Brahman. परमात्मनः चिदचिद्रूपशरीरविशिष्टत्वम् ॥ (7) The Brahman is eternal, immutable, all-powerful and the veritable abode of all endless and unsurpassed auspicious attributes. नित्यनिरतिशयानन्तकल्याणगुणाकरत्वं प्रत्यपादि ॥ (8) Knowledge (jnana ) of Brahman does not end with understanding the scriptural import; it must flower into devotion (bhakti) and only then the nescience (avidya) which is the source of phenomenal existence is removed. Only intense application to realizing Brahman (upasana) can be called knowledge, which will remove nescience. ब्रह्मज्ञानमिति न केवलं वेदान्तवाक्यार्थज्ञानम्। किन्तु तन्मूल भगवभ्दक्तिरूपो- पासनात्मकमिति ज्ञायते । वाक्यार्थज्ञानमात्रेण अविद्यानिवृत्तिश्च न भवति । परं तु तन्मूलकोपासनात्मकज्ञानेन अविद्यानिवृत्तिर्भवति ॥ (9) One who seeks liberation must worship the Godhead, accompanied by jnana and bhakti. 23 ज्ञानभक्तिभ्यामरहितेन मुमुक्षुणा मोक्षान्तं समाराधनरूपभगवदुपासनं कार्यमिति प्रत्यपादि ॥ (10) Devotion is important, although by itself is cannot lead to the ultimate goal. It is only worship that can thus lead the devotee to liberation. But devotion becomes important only when it is accompanied by knowledge. ज्ञानेन सहकृतभक्तेः एव प्राधान्यम् ॥ (11) Bhakti together with jnana is related to worship as an aid, limb or part thereof भक्तिज्ञानयोः आराधनस्य च परस्परं उपस्कार्योपस्कारकभाव सम्बन्धम्। तेन भक्तिज्ञाने आराधनस्य अङ्गभूते ॥ (12) Complete and wholesome knowledge consists in understanding the sakala and nishkala aspects of Brahman, and worshipping the Godhead in both aspects. सम्यक्ज्ञानं नाम भगवतः निष्कल सकल स्वरूपविभागाराधनम् ॥ (13) Liberation is freedom from the fetters of phenomenal existence संसारबन्धनान्मुक्तिः मोक्षः ॥ It is not merely nagative in nature. It also means ever abiding with Brahman in a state of supreme and everlasting bliss. परमानन्दस्वरूपेण ब्रह्मणा सहात्यन्तावस्थानमेव मोक्षः ॥ (14) Worship of the Godhead is the one and the only means for obtaining such liberation. भगवदाराधनस्य एकोपायत्वं, भगवन्तं नाऽन्यथा प्राप्नोतीति विज्ञायते ॥ (15) By worship of the sakala aspect of the Godhead, one obtains the four planes of liberation : salokya (obtainment of amoda), samipya (promoda) sarupya (sammoda) and sayujya (vaikuntha). The first three planes are reached by worship done with devotion, while the final plane is reached by worship done with devotion reinforced by knowledge. There is thus a gradation of bliss in liberation (ananda- taratamya) : आमोद प्रमोद सम्मोदवैकुण्ठभेदेन चतुर्धा स्थिताः भगवल्लोकाः । भक्त्यादिभिरुपासकानां आमोदादिप्राप्तिः स्यात् । वैकुण्ठप्रप्तिस्तु ज्ञानभक्ति सहकृतं आराधनं कुर्वतामेव ॥ 24 By worshipping the Nishkala aspect, one gets finally and indistinguishably dissolved in Brahman. निष्कलोपासनेन ब्रह्मणि आत्यन्तिकलयः ॥ (16) Liberation is characterized by eternal bliss, and it is ever- satisfying, as if one has partaken of ambrosia; it is abiding ever with the supreme Spirit; it means entry into the supreme light, and it is an experience without a break of the highest quarter of Vishnu- तच्च नित्यानन्दं अमृतरसपानवत् सदा तृप्तिकरं, परमात्मनो नित्यनिषेवणं, परञ्ज्योतिः प्रवेशनम् । ‘तद्विष्णोः परमं पदं सदा पश्यन्ति सूरयः, इति श्रुतिः ॥ (17) By worship is here meant only iconic worship. आराधनमिह समूर्तार्चनमेव विवक्षितम् ॥ Installing an image of Vishnu at home or in the temple and worshipping it in the Vedic mode. गृहे देवायतने वा वैदिकमार्गेण पूजनं तदर्चनम् ॥ (18) Liberation in this very life is made possible by first resorting to iconic worship, and following it up with the worship of Nishkala-Brahman. अस्मिन् जन्मन्येव मोक्षकाङ्क्षिणां अनुष्ठानप्रकारमाह ।">

  <meta name="twitter:title" content="०३ Introduction">
  <meta name="twitter:description" content="Prof. S.K. RAMACHANDRA RAO Included in the celebrated Vedantic triad known as Prasthanatraya is the Sutra-compendium (called variously Vedanta- sutras, Sariraka sutras, Sariraka-mimamsa-sutras, Brahma-sutras, Vaiyasika-sutras and Uttara-mimamsa-sutras), ascribed to Badarayana or Vyasa (son of Parasara, hence Parasarya), the other two being the Upanishads (properly called the Vedanta) and the Bhagavad Gita. The Sutra-text is described as Nyaya-prasthana, as it tries to examine the existence and nature of Brahman vis a vis the world in a rational context, with arguments and counter-arguments, with doubts raised and cleared, and with suggestions for a final and incontrovertible conclusion (the sutra’s main function being to suggest conclusions, ‘suchanat-sutram’). It seeks to present a cogent, consistent and intellectually edifying account of the Upanishadic philosophy (hence called Vedanta-sutras), and its merit consists in the analytical spirit and the methodological approach of inquiry and examination (which the expression, mimamsa, really means). It is aphoristic in nature (sutra-style), and the text consists of short, cryptic and suggestive groups of words. The well-known definition of the sutra is that it contains but few words (alpaksharam), which are unambiguous (asandigdham), and suggestive of a world of meanings (saravad visvato-mukham). However, the rigorous economy of the words, coupled with the highly suggestive character of the arrangement of the words, has resulted in a variety of interpretations. While the nature of the literary structure of the Sutra-compendium as containing a large number of topics or adhikaranas arranged in four chapters or adhyayas, each having four sections (or padas) is universally accepted, the number of aphorisms and topics are not unanimously given by the commentators on the text. The earliest commentator is Samkara (632-644 A.D.), whose approach to the Sutra has been described as unqualified non-dualism (nirviseshadvaita). It must be remembered that Badarayana was not 10 the only Sutra-kara, although his work it is that has survived till this day. He himself has mentioned the names and views of some of the earlier sutra-karas, like Asmarathya, Kasakrtsna, Audulomi, Badari and Jaimini (not the author of the Purvamimamsa-sutra). The differences among the commentators may be due to the survival of the views of these earlier sutra-karas. Samkara, for instance, upholds the views of Kasartsna. Samkara who hailed from South India takes the text of Badarayana as consisting of 555 aphorisms, (sutras) and 191 topics (adhikaranas). Bhaskara, who came after him (around 1000 A.D), and interpreted the text as favouring the Aupadhika Bhedabheda (conditional dualism and non-dualism) view, took the text as consisting of 534 sutras and 140 adhikaranas, For Ramanuja (1017- 1150) whose Sri-bhashya on the text favoured the Visishtadvaita (qualified non-dualism) view, the text had 545 sutras and 140 adhikaranas. Anandatirtha (1238-1317), whose commentary on the text is known as Brahma sutra-bhashya, projected the Dvaita (pluralism and realism) view on the text, which according to him consists of 534 sutras and 123 adhikaranas. These three viewpoints (excluding Bhaskara’s) are widely prevalent in the country to this day, and they have been explained by numerous glosses and annotations over the years. Among other commentaries on the text may be mentioned the vedanta-parijata of Nimbarka (around 1250 A.D.) of Central India, whose text consists of 549 sutras and 161 adhikaranas and who favoured the Dvaitadvaita viewpoint; the Saiva-bhashya of Srikantha (around 1270 A.D.) from Kashmir, who interpreted the text (of 544 sutras and 182 adhikaranas) in the Saiva-visishtadvaita context; the Srikara-bhashya of Sripati (around 1400 A.D.) who favoured the Sakti-Visishtadvaita View point; the Anubhashya of Vallabha (around 1500 A.D.) of Gujarat, which takes the text as consisting of 554 sutras and 171 adhikaranas and as favouring the Suddhadvaita viewpoint; the Vijnanamrta-bhashya of Vijnana-bhikshu (around 1600 A.D.), projecting the Avibhagadvaita view; and the Govinda-bhashya of Baladeva (around 1725) supporting the Achintya-bhedabheda doctrine. While these commentaries have come down to us, there are many which have been lost. Among the references available, we find that Yadavaprakasa, who lived after Bhaskara and before Ramanuja (or rather during Ramanuja’s days)11 had written a commentary, now no longer extant, upholding the view of Svabhavikabhedabheda (natural dualism and non-dualism), modifying Bhaskara’s view. A commentary that is little known but is of great importance is called Lakshmi-visishtadvaita (of Sri-visishtadvaita) - bhashya prepared by Srinivasa-makhin (Srinivasa-dikshita, Srinivasadhvari) of the Vaikhanasa tradition, which is the hoary antiquity. The name ‘Visishtadvaita’ was brought into vogue by the work of Ramanuja- charya (1017-1150), who however called his own commentary on the Sariraka-sutras Sri-bhashya. The expression ‘visishta’ (meaning “qualified”) associated with ‘advaita’ (the one, without a second as the sole reality) refers here to the Brahman having the sentient and insentient orders of existence as his own body (chidachid-prakara). We do not find the expression Visishtadvaita in Atri’s Samurtarchadhikarana or Bhrgu’s Prakirnadhikara as signifying the Vaikhanasa viewpoint. Srinivasa-mukhin specifies that the Brahman (Narayana) is invariably associated with Lakshmi, and that it is in this sense that he is ‘visishta’. Thus Ramanuja’s Visishtadvaita, is not the same as the Vaikhanasa Visishtadvaita which Srinivasa- makhin expounded, as it is commonly misconceived. The Vaikhanasa viewpoint had been prevailing from very ancient times, and even the Alwars were acquainted with it, long before the days of Ramanuja. It is not unlikely therefore that Ramanuja was to some extent influenced by the Vaikhanasa approach to divinity and Deity. This may explain the similarity of ideas that we find in Sribhashya and Lakshmi-visishtadvaita-bhashya. It is not to be construed that the latter borrowed from the former. The differences in the approaches are too conspicuous to be ignored. They will be indicated later. Ilattur Sundara-raja-Bhattacharya, who claims to be a student of Srinivasa-makhin (’natir me yam gurave’ stu tasmai’, 41), has written a short biogrophical account of his master, entitled ‘Srinivasa-dikshitendra-charitram’. He mentions here that Srinivasa- makhin was born in 4030 of the Kali-era (’trimsad-uttara-chatuhsah- asregha-vyatiteshu’), corresponding to about 1030 A.D. This would make him a junior contemporary of Ramanuja. The book also makes a specific reference to Srinivasa- makhin being earlier to Venkata- 12 natha who is celebrated as ‘Vedanta-Desika’ (b.1268). Srinivasa- makhin also had this title, as also ‘Sarvaranta-svatantra’ in common with Venkata-natha. According to the book, Srinivasa-makhin was the son of Govindacharya who was the chief priest of the hilt-shrine of Vengadam, the presentday Tirumala-Tirupati in Andhra Pradesh. The boy was invested with the sacred thread when he was five years old, and brought before the Venkatesvara image in the sanctum to begin his hereditary vocation as priest. He filled this position is later life with great devotion. It is probable that Ramanuja visited the shrine when Govindacharya was the priest, and that the two met. Srinivasa-makhin was unusually talented, and distinguished himself as a versatile scholar, poet and writer. He wrote many books, more than 25, all in Sanskrit to highlight the significance of the Vaikhanasa community to the religious traditions of the country. His works explain and vindicate the Vaikhanasa point of view regarding Siddhanta as well as Sampradaya. He was honoured widely. But he continued to serve as priest in the shrine of Venkatesvara all his life. Among his works, of particular interest to us here are his commentary on the Sariraka-sutra (Vedanta-sutra), a gloss an Paramatmikopanishad and an independent work called Uttamabrahma-vidya-sara. Sundara-raja’s biographical account also mentions that Srinivasa-makhin wrote a commentary on Valmiki Ramayana another on the Vaikhanasa-sutra, and some independent books like Tithinirnaya, Srauta-vishaya-prayaschitta and Vaikhanasa-mahima-manjari. He was also a staunch votary of Karmakanda, having performed all the prescribed paka-yajnas, havir- yajnas and soma-yaga. It was threfore that he was called ‘makhin’ (dikshita, adhvari). The work that is published now is his commentary (bhashya) on Badarayana’s Vedanta-sutra (Sariraka-sutra). The colophon to this work entitled Sri-visishtadvaita-bhashya reads: इति श्रीवेङ्कटेशपादाब्जसपर्यारत सर्वतन्त्रस्वतन्त्र श्रीर्वैखानसावतंस वेदान्तदेशिक श्रीनिवासमखीन्द्र विरचिते श्रीविशिष्टाद्वैतभाष्ये चतुर्थाध्यायस्य चतुर्थः पादः अध्यायश्च समाप्तः । शस्त्रं च समाप्तम् ॥ The alternate name for this work is Lakshmi-visishtadvaita- bhashya or more properly Sri-Vaikhanasiya- Lakshmi-Visishtadvaita- bhashya. There is a fairly elaborate gloss on this commentarial work 13 prepared by his disciple, Illattur Sundara-raja-Bhattacharya. This is known as Nigama-chuda-darpana (“The mirror to the crest-jewel of the Vedic corpus”). It ends with a devotional note : तेनास्मद् गुरूणा कृतस्य कृतिना प्रख्यातसत्कीर्तिना । भाष्यस्याशयमस्मि किं स्फुटयितुं सर्वं क्षमो मन्दधीः ॥ The glossator explains the concluding words of the commentator (इदं सर्व समञ्जसं प्रीयतां वेङ्कटेश- ॥) thus : इदं भाष्यं परजिगीषया प्रयोजनान्तरापेक्षया न कृतम् । किन्तु श्रीवैखानस कुलदैवत श्रीवेङ्कटेशप्रीत्या एव यथा परम्परारब्धविदितं भावः ॥ And the final conclusion of the commentator, quoting Marichi, भगवान्मरीचिराह श्रीशास्त्रे ज्ञानकाण्डे समूर्तार्चनमेव कारयेन्नान्यथा परमपदप्राप्तिरिति ॥ भगवान् बादरायणः प्राह भारते -’ सुरूपां प्रतिमां’ इत्यारभ्य ‘विशत्यपास्तदोषस्तु तामेव ब्रह्मरुपिणीम्॥’ इति । ‘तमेव चार्चयन्नित्यं भक्त्या पुरूषमव्ययम् ।’ इत्यारभ्य ‘सर्वदुः खातिगो भवेत् ॥’ इति इदं सर्वं समञ्जसम्॥ has been explained by the glossator. समूर्तार्चनमेवेति तदेव परमोपाय इत्यर्थः । एतच्छास्त्रकार एव भगवान् । पाराशर्यः. भगवत्समाराधनं मुक्त्युपायमुक्तवान् । अतोऽत्र न शङ्का कार्येत्यभिप्रायः । जन्मादिनिखिलदुःखनिवृत्तः इत्यर्थम् । उक्तेष्वर्थेषु न किञ्चिदप्यप्रमाणम् । अतः सर्वमभ्यर्हितमित्यर्थः ॥ This brings out in bold relief the purpose of this commentary. It is to highlight the indispensable value of iconic worship (samurta archana), which is traditionally regarded as the crown of jnana-kanda, both as a religious practice and as a spiritual expedient. The commentator and the glossator attempt to defend this position valiantly by bringing together a large mass of Vedic passages (mostly from the Upanishads) in support. The commentator quotes extensively from Paramatmikopanishad (on which text also he was written a commentary) and from Marichi’s Vimanarchana kalpa. The commentarial style closely follows the Purva-mimamsa methodology of pointing out the subject-matter (vishaya), raising doubts (visaya), suggesting prima facie arguments (purva-paksha), rebutting them with counter-arguments and establishing the correct position (siddhanta or raddhanta), and explaining the connection between topics (sangati). 14 The Bhashya opens with an invocatory varse dedicated to the commentator’s tutellary deity (kuladaiva), who is also the chosen deity for service (ishtadaiva), Venkatesvara of the Vengadam hill- shrine: निरुपमगुणसिन्धुर्नित्यलक्ष्मी समेतो निखिलनिगमवेद्यो निस्तुलो वेङ्कटेशः । निजचरणसमर्चासक्तभक्तौघरक्षी निवसतु हृदये मे स्वाङ्घ्रिभक्तिं वितन्वन् ॥ It may be remembered that Ramanuja also offers the invocatory prayer to the same deity (called here Srinivasa) at the commencement of his Sribhashya. The two prayers are very similar in intent, and emphasize the Lord’s role as the protector of all beings, his knowability through scriptures, and the incomparable value of devotion (bhakti). Srinivasa-makhin’s verse, however, adds an important detail, distinguishing the Vaikhanasa approach from other approaches; that the deity is ever associated with Lakshmi (’nitya Lakshmisametah’). This is what distinguishes this visishtadvaita (‘qualified Brahman’) from Ramanuja’s Visishtadvaita (which refers to Brahman as being qualified by Chetana and achetana, ‘chi-achid- visishta’, as his body), The supreme reality in the Vaikhanasa *approach is Brahman (Vishnu or Narayana), who contains within himself inseparably the element of Lakshmi. लक्ष्मीविशिष्टः नारायणः अद्वैत यत्र मते तल्लक्ष्मीविशिष्टाद्वैतम् ॥ The advaita here is non-difference between Narayana and Lakshmi. It is sometimes wrongly construed that the Vaikhanasa doctrine is borrowed from the Visishtadvaita of Ramanuja. Here is what Sundara-raja has to say on this point: अनेकचिद् विबुधा मन्यन्ते सर्वमस्मदीयमतम् श्रीरामानुजदृष्टान्न भिद्यतेऽत्रेति तच्च नात्युचितम् ॥ १ ॥ श्री श्रीनिवासगुरवो वैलक्षण्यं ततः पृथग्रन्थैः । वैखानसस्य विशदं कथयन्त्येव स्वतश्च महिमानम् ॥ २ ॥ भक्तिं परं हि मन्यते मोक्षोपायं महान्स यतिराजः । विखना भगवान्प्राह च भक्त्या वरमस्य पूजनं परमम् ॥ ३ ॥ ब्रूते तथैव भगवान्मोक्षोपायं स्फुटं मरीचिश्च । सिद्धान्तयति हि तद्वच्छुद्धात्मा श्रीनिवास- मखिराजः ॥ ४ ॥ कथयति यतिकुलराजो न पाञ्चरात्रे त्रयीविरोध इति । अध्वरिराजोऽस्माकं सध्वनि तत्राह तद्विरोधं हि ॥ १ ॥ । 1 Two points of difference have been noted here: (1) While for Ramanuja devotion (bhakti) is sufficient means for salvation, the Veikhanasa-satra insists that worship with devotion (pujana, 15 archana, samradhana) is that means; (2) For Ramanuja, the division of Agama known as Pancharatra is valid, while for the Vaikhanasa system it is not. It must be noted that the concept of Lakshmi, accepted in Visishtadvaita, is typically the Panchartra view, whereas the idea of Lakshmi in Lakshmi-visishtadvaita relies heavily on Paramatmikopanishat. Lakshmi in the chid-achid-visishta-advaita frame-work, is for practical purposes, and in line with Lakshmi- tantra, an independent deity with her own purushakaratva, upayatva and upeyatva (the akara-traya); she becomes owned by Vishnu, out of her own will: स्वतः श्रीः स्त्वं विष्णोः स्वमसि । as Parasara-bhatta describes and Vishnu become relevant only as the spouse of Vishnu : भवती सम्बन्धदृष्टया हरिं पश्येम । (ef Srigunaratnakosa and Kuresa’s Sri stava). Infact, Vishnu creates the world only at Lakshmi’s suggestion, which is binding on him: यस्या वीक्ष्य मुखं तदिङ्गितपराधीनो विधत्तेऽखिलं क्रीडेयं खलु । In the Vaikhanasa framework, Vishnu (more often called Narayana) is supreme, not dependent on Lakshmi in any detail or in any manner. She is, however, inseparably united with him and whatever is the attribute of Narayana (like the power to create, to pervade everywhere, being comprended in isvara-koti, and having all things and beings as her body), Lakshmi shares in it. In fact, one cannot think of Narayana without Lakshmi. The supreme reality is unitary, it is Lakshmi-narayana. In this sense, he is described as Lakshmi-visishta-advaita. I give below the English translation of excerpts from Rompicherla Parthasarathi-bhattar’s Sanskrit commentary on Marichi’s Ananda-samhita (chapter 15, PP: 267 cf., Vaikhanasa- granthamala series, 12, Igavari-palem, 1924) to illustrate the Vaikhanasa view of Lakshmi as viseshya of Narayana. “The Bhashyakara (viz. Srinivasa-makhin) has opined that Lakshmi who is the mother of the universe must be the first object of 16 our devotion, for she is the purushakara, and then Narayana alone as associated with Lakshmi must be worshipped. Marichi’s Vimanarchana-kalpa (jnana-kanda) says that Lakhmi is the extraordinary power (vibhuti) of Vishnu, eternal, devoid of origin or end, altogether beyond our means of knowing, in perfect accordance of Vishnu’s will, of the nature of immutable and immaculate bliss: she is energy (sakti) of the nature of primordial substance (mula- prakrti). She is the supreme power of Vishnu, whom the scriptures define as satyam, jnanam and anantam. She is called Sri, for she is resorted to as the refuge by all creatures. She can be known only on scriptural authority (sruti). She assumes all forms that Vishnu assumes, in accordance with Vishnu’s will. Vishnu’s all-pervasiveness is shared by her. They are indistinguishable like the power and the person who has that power. As Vishnu-purana says: त्वयेदं विष्णुना चाम्ब जगद्व्याप्तं चराचरम् ॥ Therefore the first tattva is Narayana as qualified by Lakshmi : ततो लक्ष्मीविशिष्टस्यैव परमपुरुषस्य प्रथमत्त्वभावः सम्पद्यते । They are related like prakrti and purusha, maya and mayin; no distinction can be made between them. In fact, the Lord himself assumes the feminine form as Sri, and is ever qualified by it. His power of creation is calle prakrti, for it is said: जगदुत्पादिका शक्तिस्तव प्रकृतिरिष्यते ॥ That is why in Vishnusahasra-nama, Vishnu is himself called Lakshmi and Sri.” That is why in the Vaikhasana approach, the conclusion is that it is only Narayana as inseparably associated with Lakshmi that is the protector लक्ष्म्या विशिष्ट एव पुरुषोत्तमः शरण्य इति परमो सिद्धान्तः ॥ When Narayana is resorted to as his refuge by the devotee, it is only as Lakshmi-narayana. Lakshmi represents the Lord’s compassion. लक्ष्म्या सह हृषीकेशो देव्या कारुण्यरूपया । रक्षकः सर्वसिद्धान्ते वेदान्तेषु च गीयते ॥ 17 If Narayana is ‘Isvara’, Lakshmi, is his ‘aisvarya’. The glossator Sundara-raja concludes his work summing up the purpose with which the Sariraka-sutras were compiled: एतच्छास्रकार एव भगवान् पाराशर्यः भगवत्समाराधनं मुक्त्युपायमुक्तवान् । अतोऽत्र न शङ्का कार्येत्यभिप्रायः । उक्तेष्वर्येषु न किञ्चिदप्यप्रमाणम् । अतः सर्वमभ्यर्हमित्यर्थः ॥ This is the most significant detail of the Vaikhanasa approach: The insistence on worship (iconic in nature) as the sole means of salvation. This is in sharp difference to other approaches, like Advaita which commends jnana (knowledge), Visishtadvaita which highlights the role of Bhakti (devotion), and Dvaita which suggests a judicious combination of both. While the Vaikhanasa outlook as crystallized in Lakshmi Visishtadvaita, recognizes the utility of both jnana and bhakti in leading us towards liberation, it holds actual worship as the culmination of jnana as well of bhakti. It relies on the Upanishadic passage (Mundaka): आत्मक्रीडा आत्मरतिः क्रियावानेष ब्रह्मविदां वरिष्ठः ॥ One who realizes Brahman through knowledge is Brahma- vit, and the one who realized Brahman through devotion is superior to Brahma-vit; he is Brahmavid-vara. But one engages himself in action (viz. worship) is the highest among the knowers of Brahman. He sports with Brahman who is his own self, by making iconic representation of the Brahman and offering worship to it (atma-krida). he dwells in the Brahman in loving devotion and adoration (atma- rati). The expression ‘kriya’ here refers to the worship facilitated by devotion (bhakti-sahakrta-bhagavad-aradhana). However, worship (aradhana, upasana) is different from devotion (bhakti, prapatti). क्रिया जपामूर्ताराधनसमूर्ताराधनक्रिया । (recitation of God’s name; worship in fire; worship through; which is devoid of fixed form, also called ‘huta’, fire-rituals; and iconic worship). Worship is the best form of brahma-vidya, where the word ‘vidya’ (literally meaning knowledge) means only the worship of God. विद्याशब्देन भगवदाराधनमेवोच्यते ॥ It is superior to knowing, and also to devotion. Hence it is called ‘uttama-brahma-vidya’ (the title of an independent work by Srinivasa-makhin). Its superiority (uttamatva) is also indicated when the four forms of worship are considered: (1) mental (manasika, viz. 18 japa), (2) fire rituals like agni- hotra; (3) iconic worship (bimbara- dhana); (4) and contemplation on Brahman beyond from (abimba- pujana). The mental worship and fire-rituals (huta) become capable of yielding fruits only when iconic worship is resorted either at the beginning or at the end. It is only after iconic worship, contemplation on the formless Brahman is possible. The four forms of worship may be practised in isolation (svatantryena) or together (samuchchita). Brahman has two aspects, as Srinivasa-makhin explains : with form (sakala) and without form (nishkala), as Marichi points out in the Yoga-Kanda of the Vimanarchanakalpa. ‘With form’ means having identifiable details or organs, manifested in the objects or transactional existence, and therefore knowable. ‘Without form’ is beyond the pale of our normal experience. Both, however, are ’natural’ (‘ubhayam api svabhavikam’). Even as fire is hidden unseen in fuel, oil in the sesame-seed, or juice in the fruit, but comes out in manifest form when the fuel is lit. sesame-seed is pressed, or the fruit is squeezed. The understanding of Brahman as having both these aspects is true knowledge (jnana); सम्यक्ज्ञानं नाम भगवतः निष्कलसकलस्वरूपविभागाराधन प्रकारादि ज्ञानम्॥ It is for the sake of worship that the formless and all-pervasive Brahman assumes specific iconic form as a result of special mental effort of the devotee (bhavana-viseshat), and having so assumed the form, he fulfils the longings of the devotees. तत्र परब्रह्मणः स्वभावः निष्कलः सकलश्च । निष्कलत्वं निरवयत्वम्। सकलत्वं सावयवत्वम् । एतदुभयमपि तस्य स्वाभाविकमित्यर्थः । नीरूपस्य सर्वव्यापकस्य विष्णोः साकारतयाऽविर्भावः ।… भावनाविशेषात् सकलः भवति । सकलस्वरूप एव स्वोपासकानामभीष्टं कुरुते ॥ It is only after worshipping Vishnu in both these forms, one after the other, that the devotee will accomplish his union (yoga) with Vishnu. Srinivasa-makhin in his Jijnasadhikarana-bhashya explains Marichi’s view thus : अस्मिन्नेव जन्मनि मोक्षकाङ्क्षिणां अनुष्ठेयप्रकारमाह- सगुणे ब्रह्मणि बुद्धिं निवेश्य पश्चान्निर्गुणमाश्रित्य इति । अयमर्थः । सगुणे सावयवे । ब्रह्मणि प्रतिमारूपे परमपुरुषे बुद्धिं भक्तिरुपाम् । निवेश्य तद्रूपं दृष्ट्वा तद्रतमानसः सन् । परं ब्रह्मैव एवं स्वरूपं जातमिति निश्चिन्वन् । पश्चात् । निर्गुणं निरवयम् ओङ्कारगम्यं अव्यक्तं ब्रह्म । आश्रित्य मनः प्रापय्य तद्रूपः ध्यात्वा । नित्यं आमोक्षान्तम् । एवं मोक्षे यत्नं उद्योगं कुर्यात् । तस्य योगिनः इह जन्मन्येव मोक्षो भवेत् ॥ 19 Two steps of worship are indicated here: (1) an intensely devotional approach to the iconic form of a personal deity; and (2) contemplation upon the Brahman as devoid of attributes or forms. The two are not sequentially prescribed. They must be resorted to simultaneously, According to Srinivasa-makhin: भगवदाराधन-निर्गुणाश्रयण मोक्षयत्नानां न सक्रमिकत्वम्। किन्तु यौगपद्यमेव faf That is why that the devotee even in the first step is asked not only to fix his mind steadily on the iconic form, but must convince himself that the Brahman himself, although devoid of form, has assumed this particular form for the sake of the devotee. This procedure of contemplating on the iconic form of Vishnu by the devotee turning his entire mind in that direction, and also holding on to the formless aspect, devoid of all qualities, but capable of being apprehended by the pranava (om) and thus making the mind wholly tranquil, must be considered in the light of Marichi’s prescription (patala, 89): अथातो ध्यानं वक्ष्ये, परमात्मनो जीवात्मना चिन्तनं ध्यानम् । निष्कलं सकलमिति तद् द्विविधम् । निष्कलं देवैरपि अनभिलक्ष्यम् अदृश्यं स्यात् । सकलं द्विविधं निर्गुणं सगुणं चेति । निर्गुणं निष्कलस्वभावः परमात्मनोऽन्यन्न किञ्चिदस्तीति । काष्टेऽग्निरिव सर्वं व्याप्य आकाशोपमः सर्वेषां आत्मगुहायां निहितः अन्तर्बहिश्च संस्थितो दृश्यादृश्य स्थूलसूक्ष्मोऽत्यच्छोऽप्रमेयो निरुद्योगोऽचिन्त्यो निष्कलः ॥ This leads us on to a consideration of the final goal that the Sariraka-mimamsa-sutra holds before us, as interpreted by Srinivasa- makhin in his Lakshmi-Visishtadvaita-bhashya. The purpose of all spritual enterprise is moksha, liberation from the cycle of birth and death, emancipation from phenomenal fetters. According to Marichi (patala 80), moksha is getting released from all latent impressions leading us to be fettered by transmigration. संसारबन्धनवासनान्मुक्तिः मोक्षः । This has a negative aspect, release from phenomenal constraints (samsara-mukti), and also a positive aspect, abinding in or with Brahman (brahmana sahasthitih). The second aspect is contingent upon the first, for as Srinivasa-makhin points out संसारमुक्तस्यैव ब्रह्मणा सहस्थितिः ॥ Jnana and Bhakti are helpful in accomplishing the first aspect, the elimination of ignorance (avidya) 20 and tendeny to return to the world (maya), whereas Aradhana will secure the second, for it has been said (Marichi, patala 80 ) : तदाराधनेन संसारार्णवनिमग्नो जीवात्मा परमात्मानं नारायणं पश्यति । सोऽप्यपुनरावृत्तिकं दिव्यलोकं प्रापयति । पश्चात् कृतकृत्यो भवति ॥ That Srinivasa-makhin explains jnana concerning Brahman (brahma-jnana) does not consist merely of the knowledge of scriptural import (vedanta-vakyartha-jnana ), but it is of the nature of worship; scriptural knowledge assuming the form of devotion only when knowledge takes the form of worship (upasanatmaka-jnana), avidya (nescience that binds us to the phenomenal fetters) is removed (avidya-nivrtti ). Jnana should naturally be transformed as Bhakti, if avidya is to be removed. But this does not secure salvation. For that purpose to be fulfilled, Bhakti should be reinforced by actual worship. यतो भक्तिमात्ररूपं उपासनं केवलं अविद्यानिवृित्तये भवति । तत्सहित भगवदाराधनं तु भगवत्पदप्राप्तौ अव्यवहितोपाय इति निश्चीयते । तथाह भगवान् मरीचिः भक्त्या भगवन्तं श्रीमन्नारायणमर्चयेत् । तद्विष्णोः परमं पदं गच्छतीति विज्ञायते’ इति ॥ शरीरत्व The Vaikhanasa view is that Jnana and Bhakti are intended only to supplement Aradhana; they are only ancillaries to worship. In the words of the glossator: भक्तिज्ञानयोः आराधनस्य च परस्परं उपस्कार्योपस्कारकभावसम्बन्धः । तेन भक्तिज्ञाने आराधनस्य अङ्गभूते ॥ The positive aspect of moksha consists of four divine planes of released existence for the devotee : (1) Salokya (obtainment of bliss of the first degree, amoda ), ( 2 ) Samipya (obtainment of the bliss of the higher degree, pramoda), (3) Sarupya (obtainment of still higher form of bliss known as sammoda) and ( 4 ) Sayujya (or Vaikuntha). There is this gradation of bliss (ananda-taratamya) in moksha. The devotees who work through devotion and knowledge (bhakti and jnana) become eligible to reach the first three planes. However, the final plane is obtained only by those who worship with devotion and knowledge. भक्त्यादिभिरुपासकानां आमोदादि लोकप्राप्तिः । वैकुण्ठप्राप्तिस्तु ज्ञानभक्ति सहकृतं आराधनं कुर्वतामेव ॥21 The four divine planes are reached by those who resort to worship of Brahman with form (sakalopasana), whereas those who take to the worship of the formless Brahman (nishkalopasana) get merged with Brahman, inseparably and irrevocably (atyantika-laya in Brahman). Srinivasa-makhin notes that there are many definitions for the word ‘moksha’ or liberation. (cf Jijnasadhikarana). He cites Marichi’s definition that it is release from transmigration (‘samaran muktih’). The glossator points out that Nrsimha-vajapeyi in his commentary on Vaikhanasa-sutra has another definition : ever abiding with Brahman in the form of supreme bliss: परमानन्दस्वरूपेण ब्रह्मणा सहात्यन्तावस्थानमेव मोक्षः ॥ This can happen only when one gets released from the phenomenal fetters. Thus ‘samsara-mukti’ is synonymous with ‘brahmana saha sthitih’. -6- Lakshmi-visishtadvaita-bhashya has thus many novel ideas to contribute to the general Vedantic thought. It provides valuable visighats into Siddhanta and Sampradaya, in sharp contrast to many other bhashyas. The text puts iconic worship and temple-culture on sound theoretical foundation. The main theses of this work may now be recapituated and summarized: (1) Tattva (tasya bhavahtattvam) primarily refers to the supreme Brahman (also called Narayana) as the cause of all the universe (sarva-jagat-karana). This is always associated with Lakshmi as power and compassion; and it is only thus that Godhead must be approached : लक्ष्मीविशिष्ट एवैकः प्रपत्तव्य इहोदितः ॥ (2) It (Lakshmi-Narayana) is itself the instrumental cause (nimitta-karana) as well as the material cause (upadana-karana) of the universe जगदुपादानत्वं निमित्तत्वं च एकस्य ब्रह्मण एवावगम्यते ॥ जगत्सिसृक्षोः ब्रह्मणः उपादानत्वम् ॥ The cause of the universe is known by the word Brahman. जगत्कारणं ब्रह्मशब्देन निर्दिश्यते ॥ 22 (3) Brahman is both sakala and nishkala (with form and without form); both are natural to Brahman. And there is nothing other than this. परब्रह्मणः स्वभाव- निष्कलः सकलश्च । अतोऽन्यन्न किञ्चिदस्ति ॥ (4) Brahman is distinct from the universe in which he abides as the inner principle even as butter in milk, oil in the sesame seed, fragrance in the flower, juice in the fruit, or fire in fuel. Pervading inside and outside of all things, Brahman is like formless and subtle sky. जगद्ब्रह्मणोः भेदोऽस्ति इत्याशयः प्रतिपादितः । क्षीरे सर्पिः तिले तैलं पुष्पे गन्धः फले रसः काष्ठे अग्निरिवान्तर्बहिश्च तत्सर्वं व्याप्याकाशोपमः ॥ (5) The souls as knowers of Brahman are different from the Brahman who is known by the souls. परमात्मनः जीवात्मानः भिन्ना इत्याशयो व्यञ्जिातो भवति । ज्ञेयाद्वस्तुनो ज्ञातुर्भिन्न इत्यस्यावश्याभ्युगन्तव्यात् ॥ (6) The universe which consists of living beings and non-living things is the body of Brahman. परमात्मनः चिदचिद्रूपशरीरविशिष्टत्वम् ॥ (7) The Brahman is eternal, immutable, all-powerful and the veritable abode of all endless and unsurpassed auspicious attributes. नित्यनिरतिशयानन्तकल्याणगुणाकरत्वं प्रत्यपादि ॥ (8) Knowledge (jnana ) of Brahman does not end with understanding the scriptural import; it must flower into devotion (bhakti) and only then the nescience (avidya) which is the source of phenomenal existence is removed. Only intense application to realizing Brahman (upasana) can be called knowledge, which will remove nescience. ब्रह्मज्ञानमिति न केवलं वेदान्तवाक्यार्थज्ञानम्। किन्तु तन्मूल भगवभ्दक्तिरूपो- पासनात्मकमिति ज्ञायते । वाक्यार्थज्ञानमात्रेण अविद्यानिवृत्तिश्च न भवति । परं तु तन्मूलकोपासनात्मकज्ञानेन अविद्यानिवृत्तिर्भवति ॥ (9) One who seeks liberation must worship the Godhead, accompanied by jnana and bhakti. 23 ज्ञानभक्तिभ्यामरहितेन मुमुक्षुणा मोक्षान्तं समाराधनरूपभगवदुपासनं कार्यमिति प्रत्यपादि ॥ (10) Devotion is important, although by itself is cannot lead to the ultimate goal. It is only worship that can thus lead the devotee to liberation. But devotion becomes important only when it is accompanied by knowledge. ज्ञानेन सहकृतभक्तेः एव प्राधान्यम् ॥ (11) Bhakti together with jnana is related to worship as an aid, limb or part thereof भक्तिज्ञानयोः आराधनस्य च परस्परं उपस्कार्योपस्कारकभाव सम्बन्धम्। तेन भक्तिज्ञाने आराधनस्य अङ्गभूते ॥ (12) Complete and wholesome knowledge consists in understanding the sakala and nishkala aspects of Brahman, and worshipping the Godhead in both aspects. सम्यक्ज्ञानं नाम भगवतः निष्कल सकल स्वरूपविभागाराधनम् ॥ (13) Liberation is freedom from the fetters of phenomenal existence संसारबन्धनान्मुक्तिः मोक्षः ॥ It is not merely nagative in nature. It also means ever abiding with Brahman in a state of supreme and everlasting bliss. परमानन्दस्वरूपेण ब्रह्मणा सहात्यन्तावस्थानमेव मोक्षः ॥ (14) Worship of the Godhead is the one and the only means for obtaining such liberation. भगवदाराधनस्य एकोपायत्वं, भगवन्तं नाऽन्यथा प्राप्नोतीति विज्ञायते ॥ (15) By worship of the sakala aspect of the Godhead, one obtains the four planes of liberation : salokya (obtainment of amoda), samipya (promoda) sarupya (sammoda) and sayujya (vaikuntha). The first three planes are reached by worship done with devotion, while the final plane is reached by worship done with devotion reinforced by knowledge. There is thus a gradation of bliss in liberation (ananda- taratamya) : आमोद प्रमोद सम्मोदवैकुण्ठभेदेन चतुर्धा स्थिताः भगवल्लोकाः । भक्त्यादिभिरुपासकानां आमोदादिप्राप्तिः स्यात् । वैकुण्ठप्रप्तिस्तु ज्ञानभक्ति सहकृतं आराधनं कुर्वतामेव ॥ 24 By worshipping the Nishkala aspect, one gets finally and indistinguishably dissolved in Brahman. निष्कलोपासनेन ब्रह्मणि आत्यन्तिकलयः ॥ (16) Liberation is characterized by eternal bliss, and it is ever- satisfying, as if one has partaken of ambrosia; it is abiding ever with the supreme Spirit; it means entry into the supreme light, and it is an experience without a break of the highest quarter of Vishnu- तच्च नित्यानन्दं अमृतरसपानवत् सदा तृप्तिकरं, परमात्मनो नित्यनिषेवणं, परञ्ज्योतिः प्रवेशनम् । ‘तद्विष्णोः परमं पदं सदा पश्यन्ति सूरयः, इति श्रुतिः ॥ (17) By worship is here meant only iconic worship. आराधनमिह समूर्तार्चनमेव विवक्षितम् ॥ Installing an image of Vishnu at home or in the temple and worshipping it in the Vedic mode. गृहे देवायतने वा वैदिकमार्गेण पूजनं तदर्चनम् ॥ (18) Liberation in this very life is made possible by first resorting to iconic worship, and following it up with the worship of Nishkala-Brahman. अस्मिन् जन्मन्येव मोक्षकाङ्क्षिणां अनुष्ठानप्रकारमाह ।">

  <p>Prof. S.K. RAMACHANDRA RAO
Included in the celebrated Vedantic triad known as Prasthanatraya is the Sutra-compendium (called variously Vedanta- sutras, Sariraka sutras, Sariraka-mimamsa-sutras, Brahma-sutras, Vaiyasika-sutras and Uttara-mimamsa-sutras), ascribed to Badarayana or Vyasa (son of Parasara, hence Parasarya), the other two being the Upanishads (properly called the Vedanta) and the Bhagavad Gita. The Sutra-text is described as Nyaya-prasthana, as it tries to examine the existence and nature of Brahman vis a vis the world in a rational context, with arguments and counter-arguments, with doubts raised and cleared, and with suggestions for a final and incontrovertible conclusion (the sutra&rsquo;s main function being to suggest conclusions, &lsquo;suchanat-sutram&rsquo;). It seeks to present a cogent, consistent and intellectually edifying account of the Upanishadic philosophy (hence called Vedanta-sutras), and its merit consists in the analytical spirit and the methodological approach of inquiry and examination (which the expression, mimamsa, really means).
It is aphoristic in nature (sutra-style), and the text consists of short, cryptic and suggestive groups of words. The well-known definition of the sutra is that it contains but few words (alpaksharam), which are unambiguous (asandigdham), and suggestive of a world of meanings (saravad visvato-mukham). However, the rigorous economy of the words, coupled with the highly suggestive character of the arrangement of the words, has resulted in a variety of interpretations. While the nature of the literary structure of the Sutra-compendium as containing a large number of topics or adhikaranas arranged in four chapters or adhyayas, each having four sections (or padas) is universally accepted, the number of aphorisms and topics are not unanimously given by the commentators on the text.
The earliest commentator is Samkara (632-644 A.D.), whose approach to the Sutra has been described as unqualified non-dualism (nirviseshadvaita). It must be remembered that Badarayana was not
10
the only Sutra-kara, although his work it is that has survived till this day. He himself has mentioned the names and views of some of the earlier sutra-karas, like Asmarathya, Kasakrtsna, Audulomi, Badari and Jaimini (not the author of the Purvamimamsa-sutra). The differences among the commentators may be due to the survival of the views of these earlier sutra-karas. Samkara, for instance, upholds the views of Kasartsna.
Samkara who hailed from South India takes the text of Badarayana as consisting of 555 aphorisms, (sutras) and 191 topics (adhikaranas). Bhaskara, who came after him (around 1000 A.D), and interpreted the text as favouring the Aupadhika Bhedabheda (conditional dualism and non-dualism) view, took the text as consisting of 534 sutras and 140 adhikaranas, For Ramanuja (1017- 1150) whose Sri-bhashya on the text favoured the Visishtadvaita (qualified non-dualism) view, the text had 545 sutras and 140 adhikaranas. Anandatirtha (1238-1317), whose commentary on the text is known as Brahma sutra-bhashya, projected the Dvaita (pluralism and realism) view on the text, which according to him consists of 534 sutras and 123 adhikaranas.
These three viewpoints (excluding Bhaskara&rsquo;s) are widely prevalent in the country to this day, and they have been explained by numerous glosses and annotations over the years. Among other commentaries on the text may be mentioned the vedanta-parijata of Nimbarka (around 1250 A.D.) of Central India, whose text consists of 549 sutras and 161 adhikaranas and who favoured the Dvaitadvaita viewpoint; the Saiva-bhashya of Srikantha (around 1270 A.D.) from Kashmir, who interpreted the text (of 544 sutras and 182 adhikaranas) in the Saiva-visishtadvaita context; the Srikara-bhashya of Sripati (around 1400 A.D.) who favoured the Sakti-Visishtadvaita View point; the Anubhashya of Vallabha (around 1500 A.D.) of Gujarat, which takes the text as consisting of 554 sutras and 171 adhikaranas and as favouring the Suddhadvaita viewpoint; the Vijnanamrta-bhashya of Vijnana-bhikshu (around 1600 A.D.), projecting the Avibhagadvaita view; and the Govinda-bhashya of Baladeva (around 1725) supporting the Achintya-bhedabheda doctrine. While these commentaries have come down to us, there are many which have been lost. Among the references available, we find that Yadavaprakasa, who lived after Bhaskara and before Ramanuja (or rather during Ramanuja&rsquo;s days)11
had written a commentary, now no longer extant, upholding the view of Svabhavikabhedabheda (natural dualism and non-dualism), modifying Bhaskara&rsquo;s view.
A commentary that is little known but is of great importance is called Lakshmi-visishtadvaita (of Sri-visishtadvaita) - bhashya prepared by Srinivasa-makhin (Srinivasa-dikshita, Srinivasadhvari) of the Vaikhanasa tradition, which is the hoary antiquity. The name &lsquo;Visishtadvaita&rsquo; was brought into vogue by the work of Ramanuja- charya (1017-1150), who however called his own commentary on the Sariraka-sutras Sri-bhashya. The expression &lsquo;visishta&rsquo; (meaning &ldquo;qualified&rdquo;) associated with &lsquo;advaita&rsquo; (the one, without a second as the sole reality) refers here to the Brahman having the sentient and insentient orders of existence as his own body (chidachid-prakara).
We do not find the expression Visishtadvaita in Atri&rsquo;s Samurtarchadhikarana or Bhrgu&rsquo;s Prakirnadhikara as signifying the Vaikhanasa viewpoint. Srinivasa-mukhin specifies that the Brahman (Narayana) is invariably associated with Lakshmi, and that it is in this sense that he is &lsquo;visishta&rsquo;. Thus Ramanuja&rsquo;s Visishtadvaita, is not the same as the Vaikhanasa Visishtadvaita which Srinivasa- makhin expounded, as it is commonly misconceived.
The Vaikhanasa viewpoint had been prevailing from very ancient times, and even the Alwars were acquainted with it, long before the days of Ramanuja. It is not unlikely therefore that Ramanuja was to some extent influenced by the Vaikhanasa approach to divinity and Deity. This may explain the similarity of ideas that we find in Sribhashya and Lakshmi-visishtadvaita-bhashya. It is not to be construed that the latter borrowed from the former. The differences in the approaches are too conspicuous to be ignored. They will be indicated later.
Ilattur Sundara-raja-Bhattacharya, who claims to be a student of Srinivasa-makhin (&rsquo;natir me yam gurave&rsquo; stu tasmai&rsquo;, 41), has written a short biogrophical account of his master, entitled &lsquo;Srinivasa-dikshitendra-charitram&rsquo;. He mentions here that Srinivasa- makhin was born in 4030 of the Kali-era (&rsquo;trimsad-uttara-chatuhsah- asregha-vyatiteshu&rsquo;), corresponding to about 1030 A.D. This would make him a junior contemporary of Ramanuja. The book also makes a specific reference to Srinivasa- makhin being earlier to Venkata-
12
natha who is celebrated as &lsquo;Vedanta-Desika&rsquo; (b.1268). Srinivasa- makhin also had this title, as also &lsquo;Sarvaranta-svatantra&rsquo; in common with Venkata-natha. According to the book, Srinivasa-makhin was the son of Govindacharya who was the chief priest of the hilt-shrine of Vengadam, the presentday Tirumala-Tirupati in Andhra Pradesh. The boy was invested with the sacred thread when he was five years old, and brought before the Venkatesvara image in the sanctum to begin his hereditary vocation as priest. He filled this position is later life with great devotion. It is probable that Ramanuja visited the shrine when Govindacharya was the priest, and that the two met.
Srinivasa-makhin was unusually talented, and distinguished himself as a versatile scholar, poet and writer. He wrote many books, more than 25, all in Sanskrit to highlight the significance of the Vaikhanasa community to the religious traditions of the country. His works explain and vindicate the Vaikhanasa point of view regarding Siddhanta as well as Sampradaya. He was honoured widely. But he continued to serve as priest in the shrine of Venkatesvara all his life.
Among his works, of particular interest to us here are his commentary on the Sariraka-sutra (Vedanta-sutra), a gloss an Paramatmikopanishad and an independent work called Uttamabrahma-vidya-sara. Sundara-raja&rsquo;s biographical account also mentions that Srinivasa-makhin wrote a commentary on Valmiki Ramayana another on the Vaikhanasa-sutra, and some independent books like Tithinirnaya, Srauta-vishaya-prayaschitta and Vaikhanasa-mahima-manjari. He was also a staunch votary of Karmakanda, having performed all the prescribed paka-yajnas, havir- yajnas and soma-yaga. It was threfore that he was called &lsquo;makhin&rsquo; (dikshita, adhvari).
The work that is published now is his commentary (bhashya) on Badarayana&rsquo;s Vedanta-sutra (Sariraka-sutra). The colophon to this work entitled Sri-visishtadvaita-bhashya reads:
इति श्रीवेङ्कटेशपादाब्जसपर्यारत सर्वतन्त्रस्वतन्त्र श्रीर्वैखानसावतंस वेदान्तदेशिक श्रीनिवासमखीन्द्र विरचिते श्रीविशिष्टाद्वैतभाष्ये चतुर्थाध्यायस्य चतुर्थः पादः अध्यायश्च समाप्तः । शस्त्रं च समाप्तम् ॥
The alternate name for this work is Lakshmi-visishtadvaita- bhashya or more properly Sri-Vaikhanasiya- Lakshmi-Visishtadvaita- bhashya. There is a fairly elaborate gloss on this commentarial work
13
prepared by his disciple, Illattur Sundara-raja-Bhattacharya. This is known as Nigama-chuda-darpana (&ldquo;The mirror to the crest-jewel of the Vedic corpus&rdquo;). It ends with a devotional note :
तेनास्मद् गुरूणा कृतस्य कृतिना प्रख्यातसत्कीर्तिना । भाष्यस्याशयमस्मि किं स्फुटयितुं सर्वं क्षमो मन्दधीः ॥
The glossator explains the concluding words of the commentator (इदं सर्व समञ्जसं प्रीयतां वेङ्कटेश- ॥) thus :
इदं भाष्यं परजिगीषया प्रयोजनान्तरापेक्षया न कृतम् । किन्तु श्रीवैखानस कुलदैवत श्रीवेङ्कटेशप्रीत्या एव यथा परम्परारब्धविदितं भावः ॥
And the final conclusion of the commentator, quoting Marichi, भगवान्मरीचिराह श्रीशास्त्रे ज्ञानकाण्डे समूर्तार्चनमेव कारयेन्नान्यथा परमपदप्राप्तिरिति ॥ भगवान् बादरायणः प्राह भारते -&rsquo; सुरूपां प्रतिमां&rsquo; इत्यारभ्य &lsquo;विशत्यपास्तदोषस्तु तामेव ब्रह्मरुपिणीम्॥&rsquo; इति । ‘तमेव चार्चयन्नित्यं भक्त्या पुरूषमव्ययम् ।&rsquo; इत्यारभ्य &lsquo;सर्वदुः खातिगो भवेत् ॥&rsquo; इति इदं सर्वं समञ्जसम्॥
has been explained by the glossator.
समूर्तार्चनमेवेति तदेव परमोपाय इत्यर्थः । एतच्छास्त्रकार एव भगवान् । पाराशर्यः. भगवत्समाराधनं मुक्त्युपायमुक्तवान् । अतोऽत्र न शङ्का कार्येत्यभिप्रायः । जन्मादिनिखिलदुःखनिवृत्तः इत्यर्थम् । उक्तेष्वर्थेषु न किञ्चिदप्यप्रमाणम् । अतः सर्वमभ्यर्हितमित्यर्थः ॥
This brings out in bold relief the purpose of this commentary. It is to highlight the indispensable value of iconic worship (samurta archana), which is traditionally regarded as the crown of jnana-kanda, both as a religious practice and as a spiritual expedient. The commentator and the glossator attempt to defend this position valiantly by bringing together a large mass of Vedic passages (mostly from the Upanishads) in support. The commentator quotes extensively from Paramatmikopanishad (on which text also he was written a commentary) and from Marichi&rsquo;s Vimanarchana kalpa. The commentarial style closely follows the Purva-mimamsa methodology of pointing out the subject-matter (vishaya), raising doubts (visaya), suggesting prima facie arguments (purva-paksha), rebutting them with counter-arguments and establishing the correct position (siddhanta or raddhanta), and explaining the connection between topics (sangati).
14
The Bhashya opens with an invocatory varse dedicated to the commentator&rsquo;s tutellary deity (kuladaiva), who is also the chosen deity for service (ishtadaiva), Venkatesvara of the Vengadam hill- shrine:
निरुपमगुणसिन्धुर्नित्यलक्ष्मी समेतो निखिलनिगमवेद्यो निस्तुलो वेङ्कटेशः । निजचरणसमर्चासक्तभक्तौघरक्षी निवसतु हृदये मे स्वाङ्घ्रिभक्तिं वितन्वन् ॥
It may be remembered that Ramanuja also offers the invocatory prayer to the same deity (called here Srinivasa) at the commencement of his Sribhashya. The two prayers are very similar in intent, and emphasize the Lord&rsquo;s role as the protector of all beings, his knowability through scriptures, and the incomparable value of devotion (bhakti). Srinivasa-makhin&rsquo;s verse, however, adds an important detail, distinguishing the Vaikhanasa approach from other approaches; that the deity is ever associated with Lakshmi (&rsquo;nitya Lakshmisametah&rsquo;). This is what distinguishes this visishtadvaita (&lsquo;qualified Brahman&rsquo;) from Ramanuja&rsquo;s Visishtadvaita (which refers to Brahman as being qualified by Chetana and achetana, &lsquo;chi-achid- visishta&rsquo;, as his body), The supreme reality in the Vaikhanasa *approach is Brahman (Vishnu or Narayana), who contains within
himself inseparably the element of Lakshmi.
लक्ष्मीविशिष्टः नारायणः अद्वैत यत्र मते तल्लक्ष्मीविशिष्टाद्वैतम् ॥
The advaita here is non-difference between Narayana and
Lakshmi.
It is sometimes wrongly construed that the Vaikhanasa doctrine is borrowed from the Visishtadvaita of Ramanuja. Here is what Sundara-raja has to say on this point:
अनेकचिद् विबुधा मन्यन्ते सर्वमस्मदीयमतम् श्रीरामानुजदृष्टान्न भिद्यतेऽत्रेति तच्च नात्युचितम् ॥ १ ॥ श्री श्रीनिवासगुरवो वैलक्षण्यं ततः पृथग्रन्थैः । वैखानसस्य विशदं कथयन्त्येव स्वतश्च महिमानम् ॥ २ ॥ भक्तिं परं हि मन्यते मोक्षोपायं महान्स यतिराजः । विखना भगवान्प्राह च भक्त्या वरमस्य पूजनं परमम् ॥ ३ ॥ ब्रूते तथैव भगवान्मोक्षोपायं स्फुटं मरीचिश्च । सिद्धान्तयति हि तद्वच्छुद्धात्मा श्रीनिवास- मखिराजः ॥ ४ ॥ कथयति यतिकुलराजो न पाञ्चरात्रे त्रयीविरोध इति । अध्वरिराजोऽस्माकं सध्वनि तत्राह तद्विरोधं हि ॥ १ ॥
।

Two points of difference have been noted here: (1) While for Ramanuja devotion (bhakti) is sufficient means for salvation, the Veikhanasa-satra insists that worship with devotion (pujana,
15
archana, samradhana) is that means; (2) For Ramanuja, the division of Agama known as Pancharatra is valid, while for the Vaikhanasa system it is not. It must be noted that the concept of Lakshmi, accepted in Visishtadvaita, is typically the Panchartra view, whereas the idea of Lakshmi in Lakshmi-visishtadvaita relies heavily on Paramatmikopanishat. Lakshmi in the chid-achid-visishta-advaita frame-work, is for practical purposes, and in line with Lakshmi- tantra, an independent deity with her own purushakaratva, upayatva and upeyatva (the akara-traya); she becomes owned by Vishnu, out of her own will:
स्वतः श्रीः स्त्वं विष्णोः स्वमसि ।
as Parasara-bhatta describes and Vishnu become relevant only as the spouse of Vishnu :
भवती सम्बन्धदृष्टया हरिं पश्येम ।
(ef Srigunaratnakosa and Kuresa&rsquo;s Sri stava).
Infact, Vishnu creates the world only at Lakshmi&rsquo;s suggestion, which is binding on him:
यस्या वीक्ष्य मुखं तदिङ्गितपराधीनो
विधत्तेऽखिलं क्रीडेयं खलु ।
In the Vaikhanasa framework, Vishnu (more often called Narayana) is supreme, not dependent on Lakshmi in any detail or in any manner. She is, however, inseparably united with him and whatever is the attribute of Narayana (like the power to create, to pervade everywhere, being comprended in isvara-koti, and having all things and beings as her body), Lakshmi shares in it. In fact, one cannot think of Narayana without Lakshmi. The supreme reality is unitary, it is Lakshmi-narayana. In this sense, he is described as Lakshmi-visishta-advaita.
I give below the English translation of excerpts from Rompicherla Parthasarathi-bhattar&rsquo;s Sanskrit commentary on Marichi&rsquo;s Ananda-samhita (chapter 15, PP: 267 cf., Vaikhanasa- granthamala series, 12, Igavari-palem, 1924) to illustrate the Vaikhanasa view of Lakshmi as viseshya of Narayana.
&ldquo;The Bhashyakara (viz. Srinivasa-makhin) has opined that Lakshmi who is the mother of the universe must be the first object of
16
our devotion, for she is the purushakara, and then Narayana alone as associated with Lakshmi must be worshipped. Marichi&rsquo;s Vimanarchana-kalpa (jnana-kanda) says that Lakhmi is the extraordinary power (vibhuti) of Vishnu, eternal, devoid of origin or end, altogether beyond our means of knowing, in perfect accordance of Vishnu&rsquo;s will, of the nature of immutable and immaculate bliss: she is energy (sakti) of the nature of primordial substance (mula- prakrti). She is the supreme power of Vishnu, whom the scriptures define as satyam, jnanam and anantam. She is called Sri, for she is resorted to as the refuge by all creatures. She can be known only on scriptural authority (sruti). She assumes all forms that Vishnu assumes, in accordance with Vishnu&rsquo;s will. Vishnu&rsquo;s all-pervasiveness is shared by her. They are indistinguishable like the power and the person who has that power. As Vishnu-purana says:
त्वयेदं विष्णुना चाम्ब जगद्व्याप्तं चराचरम् ॥
Therefore the first tattva is Narayana as qualified by Lakshmi : ततो लक्ष्मीविशिष्टस्यैव परमपुरुषस्य प्रथमत्त्वभावः सम्पद्यते ।
They are related like prakrti and purusha, maya and mayin; no distinction can be made between them. In fact, the Lord himself assumes the feminine form as Sri, and is ever qualified by it. His power of creation is calle prakrti, for it is said:
जगदुत्पादिका शक्तिस्तव प्रकृतिरिष्यते ॥
That is why in Vishnusahasra-nama, Vishnu is himself called Lakshmi and Sri.&rdquo;
That is why in the Vaikhasana approach, the conclusion is that it is only Narayana as inseparably associated with Lakshmi that is the protector
लक्ष्म्या विशिष्ट एव पुरुषोत्तमः शरण्य इति परमो सिद्धान्तः ॥
When Narayana is resorted to as his refuge by the devotee, it is only as Lakshmi-narayana. Lakshmi represents the Lord&rsquo;s compassion.
लक्ष्म्या सह हृषीकेशो देव्या कारुण्यरूपया ।
रक्षकः सर्वसिद्धान्ते वेदान्तेषु च गीयते ॥
17
If Narayana is &lsquo;Isvara&rsquo;, Lakshmi, is his &lsquo;aisvarya&rsquo;.
The glossator Sundara-raja concludes his work summing up the purpose with which the Sariraka-sutras were compiled: एतच्छास्रकार एव भगवान् पाराशर्यः भगवत्समाराधनं मुक्त्युपायमुक्तवान् । अतोऽत्र न शङ्का कार्येत्यभिप्रायः । उक्तेष्वर्येषु न किञ्चिदप्यप्रमाणम् । अतः सर्वमभ्यर्हमित्यर्थः ॥ This is the most significant detail of the Vaikhanasa approach: The insistence on worship (iconic in nature) as the sole means of salvation. This is in sharp difference to other approaches, like Advaita which commends jnana (knowledge), Visishtadvaita which highlights the role of Bhakti (devotion), and Dvaita which suggests a judicious combination of both. While the Vaikhanasa outlook as crystallized in Lakshmi Visishtadvaita, recognizes the utility of both jnana and bhakti in leading us towards liberation, it holds actual worship as the culmination of jnana as well of bhakti. It relies on the Upanishadic passage (Mundaka):
आत्मक्रीडा आत्मरतिः क्रियावानेष ब्रह्मविदां वरिष्ठः ॥
One who realizes Brahman through knowledge is Brahma- vit, and the one who realized Brahman through devotion is superior to Brahma-vit; he is Brahmavid-vara. But one engages himself in action (viz. worship) is the highest among the knowers of Brahman. He sports with Brahman who is his own self, by making iconic representation of the Brahman and offering worship to it (atma-krida). he dwells in the Brahman in loving devotion and adoration (atma- rati). The expression &lsquo;kriya&rsquo; here refers to the worship facilitated by devotion (bhakti-sahakrta-bhagavad-aradhana). However, worship (aradhana, upasana) is different from devotion (bhakti, prapatti).
क्रिया जपामूर्ताराधनसमूर्ताराधनक्रिया । (recitation of God&rsquo;s name; worship in fire; worship through; which is devoid of fixed form, also called &lsquo;huta&rsquo;, fire-rituals; and iconic worship).
Worship is the best form of brahma-vidya, where the word &lsquo;vidya&rsquo; (literally meaning knowledge) means only the worship of God.
विद्याशब्देन भगवदाराधनमेवोच्यते ॥
It is superior to knowing, and also to devotion. Hence it is called &lsquo;uttama-brahma-vidya&rsquo; (the title of an independent work by Srinivasa-makhin). Its superiority (uttamatva) is also indicated when the four forms of worship are considered: (1) mental (manasika, viz.
18
japa), (2) fire rituals like agni- hotra; (3) iconic worship (bimbara- dhana); (4) and contemplation on Brahman beyond from (abimba- pujana). The mental worship and fire-rituals (huta) become capable of yielding fruits only when iconic worship is resorted either at the beginning or at the end. It is only after iconic worship, contemplation on the formless Brahman is possible. The four forms of worship may be practised in isolation (svatantryena) or together (samuchchita).
Brahman has two aspects, as Srinivasa-makhin explains : with form (sakala) and without form (nishkala), as Marichi points out in the Yoga-Kanda of the Vimanarchanakalpa. &lsquo;With form&rsquo; means having identifiable details or organs, manifested in the objects or transactional existence, and therefore knowable. &lsquo;Without form&rsquo; is beyond the pale of our normal experience. Both, however, are &rsquo;natural&rsquo; (&lsquo;ubhayam api svabhavikam&rsquo;). Even as fire is hidden unseen in fuel, oil in the sesame-seed, or juice in the fruit, but comes out in manifest form when the fuel is lit. sesame-seed is pressed, or the fruit is squeezed. The understanding of Brahman as having both these aspects is true knowledge (jnana);
सम्यक्ज्ञानं नाम भगवतः निष्कलसकलस्वरूपविभागाराधन प्रकारादि ज्ञानम्॥
It is for the sake of worship that the formless and all-pervasive Brahman assumes specific iconic form as a result of special mental effort of the devotee (bhavana-viseshat), and having so assumed the form, he fulfils the longings of the devotees.
तत्र परब्रह्मणः स्वभावः निष्कलः सकलश्च । निष्कलत्वं निरवयत्वम्। सकलत्वं सावयवत्वम् । एतदुभयमपि तस्य स्वाभाविकमित्यर्थः । नीरूपस्य सर्वव्यापकस्य विष्णोः साकारतयाऽविर्भावः ।&hellip; भावनाविशेषात् सकलः भवति । सकलस्वरूप एव स्वोपासकानामभीष्टं कुरुते ॥
It is only after worshipping Vishnu in both these forms, one after the other, that the devotee will accomplish his union (yoga) with Vishnu. Srinivasa-makhin in his Jijnasadhikarana-bhashya explains Marichi&rsquo;s view thus :
अस्मिन्नेव जन्मनि मोक्षकाङ्क्षिणां अनुष्ठेयप्रकारमाह- सगुणे ब्रह्मणि बुद्धिं निवेश्य पश्चान्निर्गुणमाश्रित्य इति । अयमर्थः । सगुणे सावयवे । ब्रह्मणि प्रतिमारूपे परमपुरुषे बुद्धिं भक्तिरुपाम् । निवेश्य तद्रूपं दृष्ट्वा तद्रतमानसः सन् । परं ब्रह्मैव एवं स्वरूपं जातमिति निश्चिन्वन् । पश्चात् । निर्गुणं निरवयम् ओङ्कारगम्यं अव्यक्तं ब्रह्म । आश्रित्य मनः प्रापय्य तद्रूपः ध्यात्वा । नित्यं आमोक्षान्तम् । एवं मोक्षे यत्नं उद्योगं कुर्यात् । तस्य योगिनः इह जन्मन्येव मोक्षो भवेत् ॥
19
Two steps of worship are indicated here: (1) an intensely devotional approach to the iconic form of a personal deity; and (2) contemplation upon the Brahman as devoid of attributes or forms. The two are not sequentially prescribed. They must be resorted to simultaneously, According to Srinivasa-makhin:
भगवदाराधन-निर्गुणाश्रयण मोक्षयत्नानां न सक्रमिकत्वम्। किन्तु यौगपद्यमेव faf That is why that the devotee even in the first step is asked not only to fix his mind steadily on the iconic form, but must convince himself that the Brahman himself, although devoid of form, has assumed this particular form for the sake of the devotee.
This procedure of contemplating on the iconic form of Vishnu by the devotee turning his entire mind in that direction, and also holding on to the formless aspect, devoid of all qualities, but capable of being apprehended by the pranava (om) and thus making the mind wholly tranquil, must be considered in the light of Marichi&rsquo;s prescription (patala, 89):
अथातो ध्यानं वक्ष्ये, परमात्मनो जीवात्मना चिन्तनं ध्यानम् । निष्कलं सकलमिति तद् द्विविधम् । निष्कलं देवैरपि अनभिलक्ष्यम् अदृश्यं स्यात् । सकलं द्विविधं निर्गुणं सगुणं चेति । निर्गुणं निष्कलस्वभावः परमात्मनोऽन्यन्न किञ्चिदस्तीति । काष्टेऽग्निरिव सर्वं व्याप्य आकाशोपमः सर्वेषां आत्मगुहायां निहितः अन्तर्बहिश्च संस्थितो दृश्यादृश्य स्थूलसूक्ष्मोऽत्यच्छोऽप्रमेयो निरुद्योगोऽचिन्त्यो निष्कलः ॥
This leads us on to a consideration of the final goal that the Sariraka-mimamsa-sutra holds before us, as interpreted by Srinivasa- makhin in his Lakshmi-Visishtadvaita-bhashya. The purpose of all spritual enterprise is moksha, liberation from the cycle of birth and death, emancipation from phenomenal fetters. According to Marichi (patala 80), moksha is getting released from all latent impressions leading us to be fettered by transmigration.
संसारबन्धनवासनान्मुक्तिः मोक्षः ।
This has a negative aspect, release from phenomenal constraints (samsara-mukti), and also a positive aspect, abinding in or with Brahman (brahmana sahasthitih). The second aspect is contingent upon the first, for as Srinivasa-makhin points out संसारमुक्तस्यैव ब्रह्मणा सहस्थितिः ॥ Jnana and Bhakti are helpful in accomplishing the first aspect, the elimination of ignorance (avidya)
20
and tendeny to return to the world (maya), whereas Aradhana will secure the second, for it has been said (Marichi, patala 80 ) :
तदाराधनेन संसारार्णवनिमग्नो जीवात्मा परमात्मानं नारायणं पश्यति । सोऽप्यपुनरावृत्तिकं दिव्यलोकं प्रापयति । पश्चात् कृतकृत्यो भवति ॥
That Srinivasa-makhin explains jnana concerning Brahman (brahma-jnana) does not consist merely of the knowledge of scriptural import (vedanta-vakyartha-jnana ), but it is of the nature of worship; scriptural knowledge assuming the form of devotion only when knowledge takes the form of worship (upasanatmaka-jnana), avidya (nescience that binds us to the phenomenal fetters) is removed (avidya-nivrtti ). Jnana should naturally be transformed as Bhakti, if avidya is to be removed. But this does not secure salvation. For that purpose to be fulfilled, Bhakti should be reinforced by actual worship.
यतो भक्तिमात्ररूपं उपासनं केवलं अविद्यानिवृित्तये भवति । तत्सहित भगवदाराधनं तु भगवत्पदप्राप्तौ अव्यवहितोपाय इति निश्चीयते । तथाह भगवान् मरीचिः भक्त्या भगवन्तं श्रीमन्नारायणमर्चयेत् । तद्विष्णोः परमं पदं गच्छतीति विज्ञायते&rsquo; इति ॥
शरीरत्व
The Vaikhanasa view is that Jnana and Bhakti are intended only to supplement Aradhana; they are only ancillaries to worship. In the words of the glossator:
भक्तिज्ञानयोः आराधनस्य च परस्परं उपस्कार्योपस्कारकभावसम्बन्धः । तेन भक्तिज्ञाने आराधनस्य अङ्गभूते ॥
The positive aspect of moksha consists of four divine planes of released existence for the devotee : (1) Salokya (obtainment of bliss of the first degree, amoda ), ( 2 ) Samipya (obtainment of the bliss of the higher degree, pramoda), (3) Sarupya (obtainment of still higher form of bliss known as sammoda) and ( 4 ) Sayujya (or Vaikuntha). There is this gradation of bliss (ananda-taratamya) in moksha. The devotees who work through devotion and knowledge (bhakti and jnana) become eligible to reach the first three planes. However, the final plane is obtained only by those who worship with devotion and knowledge.
भक्त्यादिभिरुपासकानां आमोदादि लोकप्राप्तिः ।
वैकुण्ठप्राप्तिस्तु ज्ञानभक्ति सहकृतं आराधनं कुर्वतामेव ॥21
The four divine planes are reached by those who resort to worship of Brahman with form (sakalopasana), whereas those who take to the worship of the formless Brahman (nishkalopasana) get merged with Brahman, inseparably and irrevocably (atyantika-laya in Brahman).
Srinivasa-makhin notes that there are many definitions for the word &lsquo;moksha&rsquo; or liberation. (cf Jijnasadhikarana). He cites Marichi&rsquo;s definition that it is release from transmigration (&lsquo;samaran muktih&rsquo;). The glossator points out that Nrsimha-vajapeyi in his commentary on Vaikhanasa-sutra has another definition : ever abiding with Brahman in the form of supreme bliss:
परमानन्दस्वरूपेण ब्रह्मणा
सहात्यन्तावस्थानमेव मोक्षः ॥
This can happen only when one gets released from the phenomenal fetters. Thus &lsquo;samsara-mukti&rsquo; is synonymous with &lsquo;brahmana saha sthitih&rsquo;.

Lakshmi-visishtadvaita-bhashya has thus many novel ideas to contribute to the general Vedantic thought. It provides valuable visighats into Siddhanta and Sampradaya, in sharp contrast to many other bhashyas. The text puts iconic worship and temple-culture on sound theoretical foundation. The main theses of this work may now be recapituated and summarized:
(1) Tattva (tasya bhavahtattvam) primarily refers to the supreme Brahman (also called Narayana) as the cause of all the universe (sarva-jagat-karana). This is always associated with Lakshmi as power and compassion; and it is only thus that Godhead must be approached : लक्ष्मीविशिष्ट एवैकः प्रपत्तव्य इहोदितः ॥
(2) It (Lakshmi-Narayana) is itself the instrumental cause (nimitta-karana) as well as the material cause (upadana-karana) of the universe
जगदुपादानत्वं निमित्तत्वं च एकस्य ब्रह्मण एवावगम्यते ॥
जगत्सिसृक्षोः ब्रह्मणः उपादानत्वम् ॥
The cause of the universe is known by the word Brahman.
जगत्कारणं ब्रह्मशब्देन निर्दिश्यते ॥
22
(3) Brahman is both sakala and nishkala (with form and without form); both are natural to Brahman. And there is nothing other than this.
परब्रह्मणः स्वभाव- निष्कलः सकलश्च । अतोऽन्यन्न किञ्चिदस्ति ॥
(4) Brahman is distinct from the universe in which he abides as the inner principle even as butter in milk, oil in the sesame seed, fragrance in the flower, juice in the fruit, or fire in fuel. Pervading inside and outside of all things, Brahman is like formless and subtle sky.
जगद्ब्रह्मणोः भेदोऽस्ति इत्याशयः प्रतिपादितः । क्षीरे सर्पिः तिले तैलं पुष्पे गन्धः फले रसः काष्ठे अग्निरिवान्तर्बहिश्च तत्सर्वं व्याप्याकाशोपमः ॥
(5) The souls as knowers of Brahman are different from the Brahman who is known by the souls.
परमात्मनः जीवात्मानः भिन्ना इत्याशयो व्यञ्जिातो भवति । ज्ञेयाद्वस्तुनो ज्ञातुर्भिन्न इत्यस्यावश्याभ्युगन्तव्यात् ॥
(6) The universe which consists of living beings and non-living things is the body of Brahman.
परमात्मनः चिदचिद्रूपशरीरविशिष्टत्वम् ॥
(7) The Brahman is eternal, immutable, all-powerful and the veritable abode of all endless and unsurpassed auspicious attributes. नित्यनिरतिशयानन्तकल्याणगुणाकरत्वं प्रत्यपादि ॥
(8) Knowledge (jnana ) of Brahman does not end with understanding the scriptural import; it must flower into devotion (bhakti) and only then the nescience (avidya) which is the source of phenomenal existence is removed. Only intense application to realizing Brahman (upasana) can be called knowledge, which will remove nescience.
ब्रह्मज्ञानमिति न केवलं वेदान्तवाक्यार्थज्ञानम्। किन्तु तन्मूल भगवभ्दक्तिरूपो- पासनात्मकमिति ज्ञायते । वाक्यार्थज्ञानमात्रेण अविद्यानिवृत्तिश्च न भवति । परं तु तन्मूलकोपासनात्मकज्ञानेन अविद्यानिवृत्तिर्भवति ॥
(9) One who seeks liberation must worship the Godhead, accompanied by jnana and bhakti.
23
ज्ञानभक्तिभ्यामरहितेन मुमुक्षुणा मोक्षान्तं समाराधनरूपभगवदुपासनं कार्यमिति प्रत्यपादि ॥
(10) Devotion is important, although by itself is cannot lead to the ultimate goal. It is only worship that can thus lead the devotee to liberation. But devotion becomes important only when it is accompanied by knowledge.
ज्ञानेन सहकृतभक्तेः एव प्राधान्यम् ॥
(11) Bhakti together with jnana is related to worship as an aid, limb or part thereof
भक्तिज्ञानयोः आराधनस्य च परस्परं उपस्कार्योपस्कारकभाव सम्बन्धम्। तेन भक्तिज्ञाने आराधनस्य अङ्गभूते ॥
(12) Complete and wholesome knowledge consists in understanding the sakala and nishkala aspects of Brahman, and worshipping the Godhead in both aspects.
सम्यक्ज्ञानं नाम भगवतः निष्कल सकल स्वरूपविभागाराधनम् ॥
(13) Liberation is freedom from the fetters of phenomenal
existence
संसारबन्धनान्मुक्तिः मोक्षः ॥
It is not merely nagative in nature. It also means ever abiding with Brahman in a state of supreme and everlasting bliss.
परमानन्दस्वरूपेण ब्रह्मणा सहात्यन्तावस्थानमेव मोक्षः ॥
(14) Worship of the Godhead is the one and the only means for obtaining such liberation.
भगवदाराधनस्य एकोपायत्वं, भगवन्तं नाऽन्यथा प्राप्नोतीति विज्ञायते ॥
(15) By worship of the sakala aspect of the Godhead, one obtains the four planes of liberation : salokya (obtainment of amoda), samipya (promoda) sarupya (sammoda) and sayujya (vaikuntha). The first three planes are reached by worship done with devotion, while the final plane is reached by worship done with devotion reinforced by knowledge. There is thus a gradation of bliss in liberation (ananda- taratamya) :
आमोद प्रमोद सम्मोदवैकुण्ठभेदेन चतुर्धा स्थिताः भगवल्लोकाः । भक्त्यादिभिरुपासकानां आमोदादिप्राप्तिः स्यात् । वैकुण्ठप्रप्तिस्तु ज्ञानभक्ति सहकृतं आराधनं कुर्वतामेव ॥
24
By worshipping the Nishkala aspect, one gets finally and indistinguishably dissolved in Brahman.
निष्कलोपासनेन ब्रह्मणि आत्यन्तिकलयः ॥
(16) Liberation is characterized by eternal bliss, and it is ever- satisfying, as if one has partaken of ambrosia; it is abiding ever with the supreme Spirit; it means entry into the supreme light, and it is an experience without a break of the highest quarter of Vishnu-
तच्च नित्यानन्दं अमृतरसपानवत् सदा तृप्तिकरं, परमात्मनो नित्यनिषेवणं, परञ्ज्योतिः प्रवेशनम् । &lsquo;तद्विष्णोः परमं पदं सदा पश्यन्ति सूरयः, इति श्रुतिः ॥
(17) By worship is here meant only iconic worship.
आराधनमिह समूर्तार्चनमेव विवक्षितम् ॥
Installing an image of Vishnu at home or in the temple and worshipping it in the Vedic mode.
गृहे देवायतने वा वैदिकमार्गेण पूजनं तदर्चनम् ॥
(18) Liberation in this very life is made possible by first resorting to iconic worship, and following it up with the worship of Nishkala-Brahman.
अस्मिन् जन्मन्येव मोक्षकाङ्क्षिणां अनुष्ठानप्रकारमाह ।</p>
