VAIKHÃNASA ÃGAMA 
The Worship of Vishnu is being done according to Vaikhanasa Agama in several places. The worship of Lord Venkateswara at Tirumala is according to Vaikhanasa Agama. Sage Vikhanasa is the founder of this system and the agama is called in his name as Vaikhanasa Agama. 
The Vaikhanasa-agama is distin- guished from other Agama divisions by its absolute, unqualified and acknowledged affiliation to the vedic tradition. The Vaikhanasa scripture has come down to us principally in the writings of four sages of antiquity, who are reputed to have obtained it from the divine-sage Vikhanasa himself, i.c. Bhrugu, Atri, Marichi and Kasyapa. Sage Vikhanasa had written a separate and claborate Kalpa Sutra and Srauta Sutra texts. 
Out of 30 Agama texts written by these four sages only 9 texts are available now. T.T.Devasthanams has published eight texts out of these books.
