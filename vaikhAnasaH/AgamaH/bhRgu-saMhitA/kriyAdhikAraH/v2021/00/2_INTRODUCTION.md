The present work of Kriyadhikara of Bhrgu is the fourth
of the Samhitas of the Vaikhanasa Agama to be published by
the Oriental  Institute. With this the Institute would have
published the four Samhitas of the four Vaikhanasa Rsis -
Marici, Atri, Kasyapa and Bhrgu. Of these that by the last
named appears to be the most comprehensive and so the
most important. Although the general contents of all the
Samhitas are on the whole identical, still there are minor
details some of which will find a place in one while others
in the others. A comprehensive conspectus of the contents
of the four Samhitas so far published by the Institute will be
included in the proposed Introduction to Vaikhanasa
Literature in English. This introduction has been promised
in my Introduction to the Jnanakanda of Kasyapa which was
published in 1948 but owing to preoccupations I have not
been able to redeem my promise upto now. God willing, I
hope to present it to the public in the near future.
I consider Bhrugu as the most important of Vaikhanasa
authors because while the others contented themselves with
writing an elaborate account of the Kriya portion of the
Agama, leaving the Carya to be learnt from the Vaikhanasa
Kalpa Sutra, our author not only treated of the Kriya portion
but wrote an elaborate account of Carya also in the so called
Manusmrti. This fact is borne out by the many points of
contact between this Smrti and the Vaikhanasa literature.
More about this in my introduction to the Vaikhanasa
literature but I am referring to the point here to show the
importance of the present Samhita.

Now that four of the important Samhitas have been
published by the Institute, it will hereafter take up the
publication of important commentaries and Manuals relating
to the School.
I am indebted to Mr. R. Parthasarathi Bhattachar, the
editor of this work, for the trouble he has taken in settling
the text of the Samhita and in securing a number of
manuscripts from his friends for the purpose. An account
of the material used in preparing the edition is given by him
in his Sanskrit Introduction.
