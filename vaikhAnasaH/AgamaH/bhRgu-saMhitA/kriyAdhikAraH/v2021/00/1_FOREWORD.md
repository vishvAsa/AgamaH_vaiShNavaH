It is my pleasant privilege to announce the fifth edition of
“KRIYADHIKARA” which is widely read by the Pandits of
Vaikhanasa Agama and followed in the temples where the tradition
of Vaikhanasa is in vogue.
This book was published first in 1953 under the editorship of
“Vaikaranapancanana” Sri R. Parthasarathi Bhattacarya, recipient
of President Award.  Subsequently it was reprinted in 1981, 1998
and 2018.
“KRIYADHIKARA” is the creation of sage Bhrugu who is
instrumental for the incarnation of Sri Maha Vishnu as Sri
Venkateswara of Seven Hills. This book which is also known as
Bhrugu Samhita covers the entire spectrum of rites ranging from
“Karshana” (digging the earth) to “Prathishta” (placing the idol) in
39 chapters.
I record my thanks to Prof. S. Sudarsana Sarma, Vice-
Chancellor of TTD Sponsored S.V. Vedic University and his team
for taking the pains of editing the book and preparing the press
copy.  I believe that also this edition will be received well by the
Pandits and Archakas of Vaikhanasa Agama as the previous ones.
