The credit for having ushered the first publication of one

Vaikhanasa Literature goes to Sriman Raghupati Bhattacharya

familiarly famous as Sri Vasudeva Bhattacharya of

Konerirajapuram, Tanjore. He had printed and published the

Vaikhanasa Smartasutra and the Smarta part of Vaikhanasa

Mantra prasna in Granthakshara in Kumbhakonam in the year

1910.

The veteran scholar and Agama pandit Sriman Pandita

Vallipuram Raghunatha Chakravarti Bhattacharya and the

famous M.M.Vyakarana Setumadhavacharya edited

Vimanarcana Kalpa of Marici and published it under

T.T.Devasthanams auspices in the regime of Vicaranakartas

in 1926. At the same time it was published by the Vaikhanasa

Granthamala of Egavaripalem in Telugu Script in 1927. Later

the eminent scholar M.M. Sri T.Ganapati Sastri published the

works Vaikhanasa Dharma Prasna and Marici Vimanarcana

Kalpa in the Sanskrit series edited by the Government of

Travancore in 1935. For various reasons Marici alone was

imperfectly edited without proper care regarding the readings

and that too incompletely. Though some publications are

complete in respect of furnishing the mere material they do not

give satisfaciton with regard to correctness of the readings and

proper get up. It has become absolutely necessary to revise it

critically after perusing the different sources available and the

alternate Samhitas with full commentary and with English

translation. A little later two brilliant scholars Sri Vallipuram

Raghunatha Chakravarthi Bhattacharya \(above mentioned\) and


viii

Sri M. Ramakrishna Kavi, M.A., author of Bharata Kosa together

supervised the publication of Samurtarcanadhikaranam of Atri,

another Vaikhanasa Samitha under the auspices of T.T.

Devasthanams, Tirupati in 1943 and I had the opportunity of

lending my Vidyanilayam manuscripts for the purpose.

Subsequently the Travancore Government expressed their

intention of publishing the Khiladhikaram of Bhrgu and in

pursuance of it had a manuscript copy of the work prepared

with the aid of various copies available in their library. It was

sent to me for necessary critical revision with standardised

readings where different texts in evidence. To fulfil the task

assigned to me at the time I had consulted the following originals

with the help of scholars and proposed the correct texts for

publication.

1.The palm leaf manuscript \(incomplete\) available in

S.V.U.O.R. Institute, Tirupati.

2.The palm leaf manuscript with Sri Uttanur Pandita Arcakam

Narasimhacharya of Uttanur.

3.The palm leaf and paper manuscripts in the Sri Vaikhanasa

Vidyanilayam, Akulamannadu.

4.The palm leaf manuscript with Pandita Sri Konnur Sundara

Bhashya Bhattacharya of Villivakkam.

5.The paper manuscript of Sri Arcakam Peddinti Srinivasa

Dikshitulu garu, Tirupati.

6.The palm leaf manuscript available with Arcakam Sri

Soumya murthi Bhattacharya of Tirukkottiyur.

Under the impression that the said work by them. Would

be published duly edited the publication of Jnanakandam

\(Kasyapa Samhita\) and Bhrgu Samhita \(Kriyadhikaram\) was

undertaken and brought out by me under the auspices of the

T.T.Devasthanams in 1948. Subsequently there was

correspondence with the Curator of the Travancore Library

regarding the publication of Khiladhikaram with no fruitful result.

Finally learning that they had dropped the idea of such a

publication altogether, I, with the good offices of the

T.T.Devasthanams had taken up that task while I was reader in

S.V.U.O.R. Institute. At that time I had the chance of consulting

an original and old palm leaf manuscript furnished by the sons

of Agama pandita late Sri Arcakam Alagasingara Bhattacharya

of Nagamangalam. Mysore State and a transcribed paper copy

of palm leaf manuscript from Adyar library got by Sri V.M.

Narasimhan, B.A., B.E., M.I.E., M.R. San.I.\(Lon\) the famous

architect of South India, Triplicane. Taking Travancore

manuscript collection as the basic text, I had consulted the

above two texts for endorsing the readings and other materials

or research value and got the edition revised. But due to change

over of the Sri Venkateswara Oriental Research Institute to the

S.V.University, I had to retire from service under age rules and

consequently the work and the publication was delayed.

However, the manuscript prepared by me was handed over to

the University with the fond hope of its being published under

University auspices. But there the copy lay idle for some time.

The T.T. Devasthanams realising that the efforts bestowed on

the work should not go in vain without recognition, obtained the

permission of the University for the publicaiton of the work under

my supervision. The editing was begun in 1959. Due to paucity

of different versions the work being a rare one dealing with


x

material of intircate and complex nature, there had been difficulty

felt at times regarding the perfection of the readings. The correct

readings at certain stages were arrived at by greater mental

strain. Yet the matter peresented here confirms mostly to the

Nagamangalam version with necessary fixation of readings

wherever needed bearing in mind the contextual topics. In this

venture some project, I had in good measure the advice of my

friend Sri Vedantam Jagannathacharyulu Garu, the T.T.D.

Asthana Vidwan and erudite scholar in tarka and vedanta. I take

this oppurtunity of expressing my gratitude to him.

In the Vaikhanasa Bhagavachastra which is derived from

the entire Vedic tradition \(agama\), including both the Purva and

Uttara portions, the nature of God is interesting. God is

allpervasive, full of infinite attributes and is beyond all the faults

of the world and transcending all. He is capable of being

worshipped both in the amurta or formless manner as well as

the formed \(murta\). God is the supreme personality and has

five statuses. They are the Supreme transcendent Vishnu, and

the Vyuhas comprising Purusa, Satya, Acyuta and Aniruddha,

the Vibhava forms of the innumerable avataras he had taken

for the restoration of dharma of which the ten are the most

well-known, the Harda form of immanent resident in the hearts

of all as their inner ruler immortal, and the Arca form which is in

the idols or icons in temples. These icons are all descents of

the Supreme Visnu though some of them ar Svayamvyakta,

self-manifested as Sri Venkateswara on the Tirumal Hill, some

of them are Rishi formed, some others by devas and by men .

The Vaikhanasa sastra shows that from earliest times iconic

worship \(the substance of Uttara bhaga\) went followed by the

Yajna forms of worship \(which form the substance of the


xi

teaching of the Vedic Purva bhaga\) and therefore it is not a

later innovation. All these five statuses of Vishnu are one only

and are helpful to the final realisation and attainment of the

Highest State of Vishnu’s world which is he goal of all souls.

‘भक्त्या भगवन्तं नारायणमर्चयेत्तद्विष्णोः परमं पदं गच्छतीति विज्ञायते

\(श्रीवैखानससूत्रे ४ प्रश्नः\)

Vaikhanasa Sastra also speaks of the individual souls as

seeking God. But due to beginningless ignorance or avidya,

some souls are caught up in the bondage and are unable to

know God and even lose their own natue. Such souls could

attain freedom from avidya by worshipping the Archa form of

Vishnu, known as Narayan with devotion as prescribed by the

Vaikhanasa Sastra. By worshipping with devotion Narayana,

one attains the highest place of Vishnu says the Sastra.

God in the Vaikhanasa Sastra must be considered as the

self of the individual devotee and the world - sariri. Thus He is

sarvasariri. The individual souls are of atomic size and

conscient and subservient to God. The bond souls have to

realise this selfhood of God through devotional worship

according to the sastra and gain freedom. Thus the liberated

ones form a group of souls and there are said to be some souls

which have always been free from this bondage known as

Nityas. The individual souls through worship attain the highest

worlds and attain Salokya, Samipya, Sarupya and Saujya and

gain the supreme felicity of serving the Divine \(nitya Kainkarya\).

Of course those who attain this highest abode of Vishnu do not

return to the world of rebirth and sorrow.

विज्ञायते’ । \(तत्त्वज्ञानोपदेशपटले मरीचिः ।\)

In general the Vaikhanasa philosophy of God and the souls

conforms naturally to the Upanishadic philosophy expounded

by Sri Ramanuja. For Ramanuja tried to show how Narayana

is the supreme object for our devotion, through whom alone

we can attain the Highest purushartha of Vishnu, Brahma

sannidhya and Kainkarya, who is spokesn of as the Sariri \(Self\)

of whom the universe and the souls are body \(sarira\), and

showed that semusibhakti is most important for the worship of

the Area form of God Srinivasa.

To conclude, I feel great pleasure in expressing my heartfelt

gratitude to the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams Board of

Trustees and to the eminent Executive Officer, Sri C. Anna Rao,

B.A., for having given me this opportunity of bringing out a rare


xiii

work attractive in such a manner. I owe much to the owners of

manuscripts consulted by me as aforesaid, for placing their

originals with me. My gratitude is also in great measure due to

the Superintendent and the staff of T.T.D.Press who got the

work completed neatly and properly. I crave in indulgence of

the scholars if any mistakes have crept into this work.
