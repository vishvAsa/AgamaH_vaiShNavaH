Tirupati

“Khilādhikāraḥ” is a valuable work of sage Bhṛgu. This

book contains lot of information right from ploughing the land and

construction of the temple. Important features of Vaikhanasagama

like construction of the temple, consecrations, installations, the idols,

various sub-rituals are vividly explained. As a result, this book is

highly useful to the followers of Vaikhanasagama which is adapted

in Srivari Temple of Triumala.

“Khilādhikāraḥ” was first edited by the veteran scholar

Sriman Rompicherla Parthasarathi Bhattacharya and was published

by TTD in 1961. The second and third editions appeared

respectively in 1997 and 2018. I am happy to announce the fourth

edition of this highly demanded book. The responsibility of editing

and preparing the blemishless press copy was given to S.V. Vedic

University. I record my sincere thanks to Prof. S. Sudarsana Sarma,

Vice-Chancellor and his team of scholars for their successful

contribution. Praying the lord of Seven Hills to bless us to serve him

better, I present the fourth Edition of “Khilādhikāraḥ” to the

intelligentsia.
