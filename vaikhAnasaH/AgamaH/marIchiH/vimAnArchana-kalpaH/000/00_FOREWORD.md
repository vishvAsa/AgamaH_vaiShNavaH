Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams have been preserving and propagating the tradition of Vaikhanasa Agama. It is well known that this Agama is followed in Srivari Temple in Tirumala. Simultaneously, the TTD has been bringing out the literature related to Vaikhanasa Sampradaya and presently I am very happy to announce the publication of the much required “Vimanarchana Kalpa”. This book, composed by Maharshi ‘Marichi’ in 101chapters \(Patalas\) serves the purpose of a manual to perform various rites in the temple and hence occupies a unique place in Vaikhanasa literature. “Vimanarchana Kalpa” was published by TTD, first, in 1998. The demand for this book has been so high that all the copies got exhausted within no time. At our request Prof. S. Sudarsana Sarma, Vice- Chancellor, S.V. Vedic University, assisted by a team of scholars took all necessary care to prepare a fresh press copy and we are happy to publish this book, hoping that the scholars will be benefitted by the second edition.
