There is an outer perimeter , which has a silver lined doorway leading to the inner part of the temple ( Vendi Vakili or silver corridor) . 

This leads to the inner temple, which is gilded over by gold ( Bangaru vimanam). The inner temple has a courtyard called Tirumaamani mandapam, or Mahamani mandapam, which is gilded all over by gold plates. This courtyard has Garudalwar, and the 2 dwarapalakas ( Jaya and Vijaya ) , and the Main bell, and Hundi of the temple. 

Beyond this courtyard are 3 rooms, after which room number 4 is the main Garbhalayam .

Cameras are NOT allowed beyond the silver threshold in the temple. All the video footage we see, is of events which occur outside the silver threshold only. Any photos beyond it are either old ones or secretly captured and restricted.

## mUla-bera unphotographed
real Mulavirat of Tirumala has never been photographed. 

### Video
Video depiction is also fake. eg. one shot in Vijaya vAhinI studios set in chennai.

Differences - 

1. the real mulavirat is much taller
2. there are NO DOORS to the innermost sanctum ( removed 200 years ago)
3. the arch ( prabhavali or makara thoranam) has a stone base till the knee level. it is not full metal as shown there. its also a more 3d structure, and not a flat sheet like one.
4. bhoga Srinivasa ( kautuka beram) is missing from the appropriate position ( Jeeva sthanam) in the garbhalaya.

[This video](https://youtu.be/piP86vYD6a0?si=9xMSf4QGY_NvKgZb) is from a documentary called Venkateswara Vaibhavam , released in 1970. 



## Gag order
TTD has placed strict orders, and no information pertaining to the sanctum sanctorum is supposed to leak outside. Due to all the political problems, and the recent setbacks they faced, the archakas have been reclusive, and slow to share any information.
