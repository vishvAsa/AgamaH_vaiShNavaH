+++

Among the Pallavas only one later king, viz., Ko-Vijaya-Dantivikrama-Varman is represented by two epigraphs from Tiruchanur, which give his regnal year 51 which approximates to 830 A.D. (219-T.T. and 223-G.T.). In the later inscriptions the date is missing. But both the inscriptions register the record of a gift of gold for a perpetual lamp in the temple. 

The contemporary of Parantaka II, Sundara Chola, Ko-Parthivendra-varman, who probably belonged to the family of the Pallavas who were dispossessed of their kingdom of Tondamandalam by Aditya I, had a certain Kadava subordinate under him, by name Sakti-Vitankan. His queen Samavai was the donor of two records of the temple. The queen is said to be the daughter of a Pallavappergadaiyar. The Kadava chief Sakti-Vitankan had some sort of relationship to Danti-Saktı-Vitanki ahas Lokamahadevi one of the queens of Rajaraja I. 

Queen Samavai presented to Manavalapperumal many costly jewels like tirumudi, malas, udarabandham, tirumarai-pattikaı, bahuvalayam, tirucha- chandam, vadiyal, karaı, padachayalam and prabha. She also arranged for the daily offering of a plate of cooked rice and holy bath on the occasion of the two ayana-Samkrantis and the two vishnusamkrantis. The celebration of the Purattasi festival for nine days, beginning with ankurarpanam, the day of the Chitra star, and another festival of two days duration before it, was also instituted. (18-T.T.). Samavai also gifted land for the expenses of a festival to be conducted twice a day for seven days prior to Mukkoti- dvadasi for Manavalapperumal. (19-T.T.).
