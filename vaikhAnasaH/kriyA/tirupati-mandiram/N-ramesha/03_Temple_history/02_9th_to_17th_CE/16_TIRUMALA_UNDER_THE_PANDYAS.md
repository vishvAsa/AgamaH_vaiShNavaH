Only one Pandya king is represented by few inscriptions recorded in prasasti in Sanskrit which pertain to Jatavarman Sundara-Pandya I. 

His prasasti as given in No. 175-T.T. represents him as the ornament of the lunar-race (Somakula-tilaka), the ruler of the town of Madhura (Madhurapuri Madhava), the destroyer of the family of the Keralas (Keralavamsa-nirmulana), the second Rama in shattering Lankapuri (Lankapuri-luthana-dvitiya-Rama), the thunderbolt to the mountain which is the Chola family (Cholakulasaila- kulisa), one who put to flight the Karnata king (Karnataraja-vidravana), the destroyer of the forts of the several enemy kings(Vividharipu-durga-mardana,) , the kindler of the fire to the forest which is Vira-Gandagopala (Vira-Ganda- gopala-vipina-davadahana), the lord of Kanchi the best of cities (Kanchipura- varadhisvara), the tiger to the deer which is Ganapati (Ganapati-harina-sardula), the establisher of the suppliant kings (Pranata-raja-pratishthapaka), the lord paramount over the maharajas and adhirajas (Maharajadhiraja-paramesvara) and the sovereign over the three worlds (Tribhuvanachakravarti). He is therein called Sri Sundara-Pandyadevapperumal. There are several other records of this king in Tirumala Temple (127, 140, 164, 172, 175, 230, 241 T.T. and 11 G.T.) though they have no other useful information.
