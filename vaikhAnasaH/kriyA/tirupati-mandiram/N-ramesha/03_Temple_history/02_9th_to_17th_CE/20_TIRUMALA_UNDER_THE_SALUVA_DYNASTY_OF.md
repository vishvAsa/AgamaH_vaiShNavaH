title = "20 TIRUMALA UNDER THE SALUVA DYNASTY OF VIJAYANAGAR"
+++

Even during the last years of Devaraya II, the Saluvas appear to have been rising to power. Saluva Peri-Mallayadeva Maharaja, son of Errakampaya- deva Maharaja, comes to notice from No. 13-TT. dated in Saka 1368, Kshaya (10-10-1446 A.D.). 

No. 100-TT. dated in Saka 1364, Dundubhi, registers the payment of 3000 honnu as kanike for the God by Tippada Nageya-Nayakkar, son of Muddiya-Nayara. Probably he was a general (Nayaka) under Devaraya II and belonged to the Vijayanagara forces stationed at Chandragiri. 

Srigiri, who presented a golden pattam (No. 99-TT.) in the cyclic year Sadharana corresponding to the Saka year 1352, expressed by “the eyes (2), the arrows (5), Rama (3), and the Moon (1),” (1-7-1430 A.D.), must be identical with Srigiri-Bhupala, surnamed Pratapa Devaraya, the son of Vijaya and the younger brother of Devaraya II “who witnessed the elephant-hunt ”

(Ep. Ind., Vol. VIII, page 306; and Mad. Ep. rep. for 1905-06, page 82). He is said to have been ruling over the Marakatanagara-pranta, somewhere in the North Arcot district, in Saka year 1346 (Ar. Sur. Rep. for 1907-08, page 248, foot-note 5). 

Only one date is available for Mallikarjuna, viz., Saka 1371, Sukla (4-3-1450 A.D.) (No. 199-GT.), which is about the second year of his reign. This record registers the sale of a house and house-site by two Srivaishnavas of Tirupati in favour of one Rajamalikam Chennappa Udaiyar belonging to the Niyogi sect of Brahmanas and residing in Chandragirı. Probably this Chennappa Udaiyar was a state official engaged in offering garlands of flowers to the kings and nobles on auspicious and ceremonious occasions (raja malikam). 

Tirupati and Chandragiri which are only seven miles apart, the latter being situated to the south-west of the former, are stated in this epigraph to have been comprised in the two different sub-districts of the Tiruvenkatakottam, Tirupati being in the Tirukkudavur-nadu and Chandragiri in the Vaikunda-valanadu (Vaikuntha-valanadu).
