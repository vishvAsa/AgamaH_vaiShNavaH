+++

The ruling line of the Aravidu family commenced with Tirumala, who acquired power as the chief minister of Sadasivaraya in 1565 A.D. after the death of his elder brother Aliya-Ramaraya in the battle of Talikota, ascended the Vijayanagara throne ten years later in about 1575 A.D. having at the same time changed his capital to Penugonda. His was a brief reign lasting for two or three years during which his second son Srirangaraya or Ranga II ruled as co-regent with him. His Unjal-mantapam, generally called the Tirumalaraya-mantapam, with its exquisitely sculptured high pillars bearing the figures of a warrior riding a horse standing erect over an elephant with

another elephant higher up, stands in tact to this day as a memorial of his service in the temple, and forms the seat of the asthanam of the processional image of Sri Venkatesvara during the annual Brahmotsavams in the temple. 

Srirangadeva Maharaya II: The next reign, that is, that of Srirangadeva Maharaya, is represented by half a dozen inscriptions ranging in date between Saka 1501 (1579 A.D.) and Saka 1508 (1586 A.D.). 

Venkatapatiraya, generally known as Venkata I, is represented in the temple by about a dozen inscriptions extending in date from Saka 1514 (1592 A.D.) to Saka 1538 (1616 A.D.). He was the fourth son of Tirumala and the youngest brother of Sriranga II. From a record from Markapur in the Kurnool district, he is seen to have been a subordinate of Sadasivaraya in Saka 1489 (1567 A.D.). In two epigraphs from the Salem and North Arcot districts he is stated to be referred by his title alone, viz., “ Viravasantaraya" (Ar. Sur. Rep. for 1911-12, page 187). During the reign of his father Tirumala and his elder brother Sriranga II, he governed the Chandragiri-rajya as its viceroy, as indicated in the Telugu-kavya Vasucharitramu (Canto I, Introduction, verse 81) and in No. 185 of 1922 dated in Saka 1494, Angirasa, Ashada (9-7-1572 A.D.) during the reign of Sriranga, and next held charge of the Udayagiri, Kondavidu, and other outlying hill fortresses. He had married five queens out of whom Krishnamamba or Krishnajiamman mentioned in No. 97 - T.T. was one. 

His coronation was performed by Ettur Tirumalai Kumara-Tatacharya, who was his family priest as mentioned in No. 671 - T.T. of Saka 1505, falling into the reign of Sriranga II. 

Kumara-Venkatapatirayadeva Maharaya known from the temple by two records Nos. 328 and 63 - G.T. dated respectively in Saka 1553 (1631 A.D.) and Saka 1557 (1636 A.D.). This Kumara-Venkata, also known as Peda-Venkata II, was the son of Ranga IV who was a son of Aliya-Ramaraja. He was chosen crown-prince along with his successor Ranga VI by Rama IV in Saka 1544 (1622 A.D.). He is stated to have been crowned king in Saka 1552 (1630 A.D.) by Tirumala Tatacharya. 

No. 328 - G.T. registers the provision made by a certain Ramachandrayya for offerings for Sri Venkatesa and Sri Govindaraja in Saka 1553, Prajotpatti, Kanya (29-9-1631 A.D.), and the construction of a mantapam by him to the west of the Matham of the Ilian-Kelvi-Jiyar on the south side of the street adjoining the Sannidhi-vidhi to the south. He excavated afresh the irrigation channel in Varadarajapuram which was at the time in disrepair. No. 63 – G.T. 

79

also refers to the excavation of an old damaged irrigation channel in the tiruvidaiyattam village Avilali by Alagarayyangar of Srivatsa-gotra, Apastamba- sutra and Yajus-sakha, and his gift of some lands therein. The measuring rod of 32 feet is mentioned in it. 

Srirangadeva Maharaya, generally known as Ranga VI, was the son of Pina-Venkata III, the younger brother of king Venkata II. He was crown- prince during the reigns of both Rama IV and Venkata II and ascended the Karnata throne on 29th October 1642 A.D. His reign lasted for a period of about 23 years upto Saka 1587 (1665 A.D.). During his reign, the Sultans of Golconda and Bijapur invaded the Karnata kingdom and conquered it and "the able general Mir Zumla finally became its Nawab. King Ranga fled southwards and found refuge with one of his subordinates, a chief of Keladi" (Ar. Sur. Rep. for 1911-12, page 193). 

Srirangaraya is represented in the temple by two epigraphs of which only one is dated, viz, Saka 1560, Bahudhanya, Mithuna (15-6-638 A. D.). On this date a certain Brahmana of the Kasyapa-gotra and Apastamba-sutra, born under the ascendency of the star Mula, provided for offerings costing 95 rekhai for which he made over to the temple two irrigation channels, from one of which was derived 160 patti of paddy, as measured with the Kadamaikkal (No. 5 - G.T.). The other channel is said to have been situated in Maniyak- konpattu, one of the villages comprised in the Tiruvidai-yattam-Ul-Mandalam. The second inscription No. 436 - T.T. merely records the eternal obeisance of a certain Ramudu of Tirupati, a servant of Srirangaraja, at the feet on Raghunatha 

Two later inscriptions, one dated in the cyclic year Rudhirodgari (1683 A.D.) and another in Saka year 1606, Raktakshi (1684 A D.), do not mention the reigning king, but they are referable to the reign of Venkata IV, the successor of Ranga VI (Ep. Ind., Vol. XVI, page 91). These two epigraphs, together with a third No. 290 - G.T., are written in Telugu, which was the main local language of this area No. 291 G.T. dated in Rudhirodgarı, Vaisakha (Saka 1605-16.5.1683 A.D.), registers the Ubhayam (service) of a certain Timma, son of Tuvarani Konda Pandita and the obeisance of his younger brother, while No. 290 - G.T. merely registers, as an extract, the Ubhayam of Rajasri Siddaluri Ramajı-Madarasu-Pantulungaru No 263 T.T of 

Saka 1606, Raktakshi, Chaitra (—20-3-1684 A.D.), records the gift of a Kanthe (necklace) of pure gold valued at 575 srirangaraya-varahas as the capital for offerings for Tiruvengalanathasvami and Varahasvamı, following those of Maharajasri Shubabanuja-Pantulu by Rajasri Sivaraja-Ramachandra-
