Subsequently the administration by the Mutt came to an end in 1933 when the Committee system of management replaced the Vicharana Karta Mahants. Later on by the Hindu Religious Endowments Act of 1951 and the Andhra Pradesh Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Act of 1966, were enacted, made the administration of the temple had been handed over to a Board of Trustees representing all shades of public opinion. In 1979 the Tirumala Tirupathi Devasthanam bill was passed, under which the management of the temple became autononous with a committee of management and also a Board. This self contained legislation has enabled the administration of the temple to be run on efficient lines. 

Thus, the epigraphs of Tirupati Temple constitute the main source of our knowledge of the history of the Temple. Coupled with the literary evidence upto 9th century A.D., the history of the Temple could be viewed together from the beginnings of the Christian era upto modern times.
