title = "10 TIRUMALA IN NAMMALVAR"
+++

Next after the early Alvars comes Nammalvar who is generally regarded by the Vaishnava Tradition as the best and greatest of them all. His works have come to be regarded as a faithful rendering of all that is of value in the teaching of the Veda. The Tiruvaymoli of Nammalvar is generally regarded as being a rendering of the Veda in Tamil. The earliest Tamils seem to have made a distinction between the Veda and Upanishads by calling the first as Vaymoli and the second as Marai though the latter term has now become more or less fashionable for the entire Vedic literature. 

Nammalvar may be regarded as belonging to the period later than the first early Alvars and contemporary to the later group ending with Tirumangai Alvar. The first three Alvars have composed poems in Venba metre in Tamil whereas the fourth has also about 120 stanzas in Viruttam. 

Unlike the early Alvars, Nammalvar's references to Tirumala are of a character to meet the requirements of a literary artist. He devotes ten poems of the Tiruvaymoli to Tirumala itself, and makes explicit reference to the great shrine there. There are one or two other groups of ten verses where references to Tirumala are not direct but there is substantial evidence that he had only this temple in mind. 

There are seven references to Tirumala in the Tiruviruttam of this same Alvar. They are more or less of the form of address where he apostrophizes some of the flower gardens as being of the country of Tirupati, or of Tirupati which has beautiful gems all round the hill glowing in day light. The Tiruvasiriyam and the Periya Tiruvandadi do not contain any direct references to Tirumala as such, but stanza seven of the latter contains a reference to Lakshmi being on the chest of Vishnu, which is the exact meaning of the term Srinivasa, the name of the God at Tirumala.
