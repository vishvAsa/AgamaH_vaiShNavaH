title = "06 BHUTAM ALVAR"
+++

Bhutam Alvar refers to Vengadam in eight places or stanzas directly. The first reference is in stanza 25 where the Lord is described as standing on the Hill at Tirumala. In stanzas 33, 45 and 46 there are general references to Tirumala and Vishnu. In stanza 70 reference is made to a number of Vishnu shrines, and in stanzas 72 and 75 also similar references are made. Stanza 28 equates the deity presiding in Vengadam to the deity presiding in Srirangam. 

So it comes out clearly that *Bhutam *Alvar, no less than Poygai Alvar, was devoted to Tirumala as a Vishnu shrine to which he was extremely devoted. There are stanzas in this centum which could be picked out detailing the ordinary norms of worship of all the Vaishnavas. One feature in particular has to be noted in respect of this Alvar, which is also a common feature in others, that the best form of worship is the orthodox vedic way; but it is recognised simultaneously that it is not actually possible for all It certainly is the best for those who can do it; but, for those who cannot, other forms of worship are prescribed as equally efficient in saving power; and, among these, the most efficient is the mere recital of the name of Lord as equally capable of saving all of us.
