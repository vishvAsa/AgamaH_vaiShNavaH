title = "11 OTHER ALVARS"
+++

From Nammalvar onwards, we have a group of seven Alvars who are later in time and these also make a reference to Tirumala in their literature. 

Particular mention must be made of Nacchiyar Tirumoli of Andal who is generally worshipped in Vaishnavite temples and also of Alvar Kulasekhara who was a ruler of the Chera country. Coming to Tirumangai Alvar who is probably the latest Alvar, we have a dozen references to the God of Vengadam in his works.

We may therefore conclude that to the Alvars whose period of life may be held to extend from the Sangam period from the 3rd century after Christ to the 8th century A.D. When Tirumangai Alvar flourished, there has been a continuous tradition that there is a shrine called Vengadam dedicated to Vishnu. These literary references from known historical times up to the 8th century A.D. clearly refer to Tirumala as a sacred place. From the 8th century A.D., we have epigraphical references to Tirumala.
