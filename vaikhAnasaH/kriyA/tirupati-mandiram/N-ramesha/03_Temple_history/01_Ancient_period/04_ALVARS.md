The Prabandha Four Thousand,' the ancient Vaishnava piece of literature, is a collection of 4000 stanzas of Tamil poetry celebrating the 108 places of worship sacred to Lord Vishnu. These poems are attributed by tradition to a certain number of devotees, generally counted as twelve and called as Alvars. This literature throws considerable light on the early history of Tirumala. The whole body of this literature can be said to refer roughly to the five centuries from 300 to 800 A.D. Three of these are known as the first Alvars, described as the singers in classical Tamil (Sen Tamil) by Tirumangai Alvar, viz., Poygai alvar, Bhutam alvar and Pey alvar. One other alvar who follows viz., Tirumalisai alvar is also generally counted as one of the early alvars. 

From the internal evidence of their works, it is possible to come to some fairly definite conclusions with regard to their period of activity, and this, in itself, would throw a flood of light upon the history of a shrine like Tirumala, not to mention other general questions, such as the rise of the cult of Bhakti, and of the school of Vaishnava worship generally known as the Pancharatra, or Agamaic worship more generally. This latter class of literature lays down the norms of the life of a devotee, and prescribes the various forms in which worship should be conducted by differing classes of people, with a view to achieving the ends of existence here, and attaining to a permanent place hereafter.
