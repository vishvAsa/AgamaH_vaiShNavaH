title = "03 TIRUPATI AND TIRUMALA NOT REFERRED TO AS HOLY SHRINE"
+++

It is interesting to note that in these ancient references, a number of authors of eminence, refer to Vengadam and give details of features which were regarded in those days as characteristics of the hill and the region surrounding it, but no specific reference to the great shrine which now dominates the entire area is given. Reference has already been made to poem 61 of Mamulanar, in which the celebration of the festivals is clearly referred to. This leads to the unmistakable inference about the existence of the temple there and the series of festivals connected with it. During the period of the Sangam literature therefore the importance is more to the sanctity of the hill, rather than to the temple, and the temple as such, had not yet taken over the importance which the hill had in this early age. 

However, references from Sangam literature to this area make clear three points. Firstly Tirupati is Vengadam and it lay in the borderland between the Tamil and Telugu speaking people. Secondly the language to the north of the hill was different. Thirdly the country was forest country, with elephants roaming about, and it was ruled by a chieftain by name Pulli ruling over a people who are described as Kalvar, possibly with a variant form as Kalvas and he subsequently seems to have come under the authority of a chieftain Tiraiyan, with his capital at Vengadam, and with perhaps an alternative capital at Pavattiri, a little further north.
