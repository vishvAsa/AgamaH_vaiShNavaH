title = "08 TIRUMALA IN SILAPPADHIKARAM"
+++

The Tamil classic Silappadhikaram, the author of which was not a Hindu refers in his work to Tirumala as a place of Vishnu shrine. Ilango Adigal, the author of this work describes Venkatesa on the Hill in the following terms in Book XI, lines 41 to 51:- 


        *"High on Vengadam's towering crest,  \
with flowing streams in flood,  \
Betwixt the effulgent glory, of shining Sun and Moon,  \
Like unto a blue cloud in lightning dres’st  \
In all the brilliance of rainbow dight,  \
The Red-eyed great One, majestic stands  \
In dress of flowery brilliance with garland bright,  \
One lotus hand with fearsome disc adorned,  \
and milk white conch (the other held)." *

The above description is put into the mouth of a brahman pilgrim, a native resident of Mangadu in Malainadu. This pilgrim was on his journey across the Pandya country and was staying for the night in the outer groves of the Chola capital, Uraiyur. During the course of this journey he meets Kovalan, the hero of Silappadhikaram, and during his talks the pilgrim mentions the Pandyan territory and says that he was going on a pilgrimage to visit the Vishnu shrine of Srirangam and Vengadam. The reference to Tirumala comes in this context. 

It is clear from this statement that the shrine at Tirumala was considered in those ancient days as a very holy vaishnava centre. The terms in which the Vishnu shrine both at Srirangam and Tirumala, and the one at Tirumal Irumsolai are referred to, give clear evidence that the shrine at Tirumala had the reputation of being a famous Vishnu shrine, and that its reputation had reached so far out as the West Coast that people from there were in the habit of going on a pilgrimage to Tirumala as they do even now as one of the holy Vaishnava centres. A statement like that from an author who makes the statement no doubt in poetry, and in the course of a romantic epic, proves the general position that the temple at Tirumala was by common repute a temple dedicated to Vishnu.
