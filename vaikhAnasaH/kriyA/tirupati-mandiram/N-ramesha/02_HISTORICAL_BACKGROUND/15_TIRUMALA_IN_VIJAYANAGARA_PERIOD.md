title = "15 TIRUMALA IN VIJAYANAGARA PERIOD"
+++

Tondamandalam was included in the kingdom of Vijayanagara from  the time of its foundation and continued as part of it till the time of its fall.  The period of the rule of the Sangama, Saluva, Tuluva and Aravidu dynasties  of Vijayanagara constitutes the most brilliant epoch in the history of the  Tirumala-Tirupati region and of its temples.  

*The Sangama Dynasty*:-The earliest record of this dynasty found in  this region belongs to the time of Harihara I, the second ruler (1355-1377).  One important event of the time which is not known from the inscriptions  but is mentioned in the Koyil-Olugu is the removal of the processional image  of Ranganatha from Triumala to Srirangam. Kumara Kamparaya, a  Vijayanagara prince, led an expedition against the Muslim Sultan of Madura  and put an end to his rule. Gopanna, a brahman general of this prince,  got this image re-installed at Srirangam in 1371 A.D. The idol was taken  to Ginjee and kept there for some time and then finally restored to the Ranganatha temple. In all probability, it was removed from Tirumala in or about  1368 A.D. The next ruler, Harihara II, is mentioned in an inscription from  Tirumala.  

Devaraya II (1406-1447), the greatest ruler of the Sangama dynasty,  was a great devotee of Sri Venkatesvara. He visited the temple and worshipped  the god in November, 1428 A.D. and made a substantial gift for the restoration  of Vedaparayanam in the Tirumala temple.  

Mallikarjuna, the last king of the Sangama family, is represented in the  records from bo,th Tirumala and Tirupati. Other important penons thst  figure in this region are Saluva Gopayya, Saluva Tumnaraja, Saluva Parvata raja, Saluva Tripurantaka, Kampayadeva, Saluva Erramaraja, Tammayadeva  Coda and Vallabhayadeva. Saluva Narasimha, who was the generalissimo  and the de-facto ruler during the last days of the Sangama dynasty, was a  great benefactor of the Tirumala and Tirupati temples. His institution of  the Anna-unjal-Tirunal in the temple of Sri Venkatesvara in a mantapa  specially constructed for the purpose was a valuable benefaction.  

*Saluva Dynasty*:-Saluva Narasimba set his master aside and usurped  the throne of V1jayanagara. As the sovereign he installed an image of god  Lakshminarasimha by the side of the pathway leading up the lull. (II-82).  

*Tuluva Dynasty*:-The temple of Sri Venkatesvara reached the acme of  its glory in the reign of the illustrious emperor, Krishnadevaraya of the Tuluva  or third dynasty of Vijayanagara (1509-1529). Sri Venkatesvara was the  patron deity of this monarch. On every important occasion the Raya visited  Tirumala and obtained the blessings of the god. His first visit to the temple  was on 10th February, 1513. Inscriptions record other visits of this monarch  in 1513, 1514, 1515, 1517, 1518 and 1521 to the temple, each of which resulted  in substantial and valuable presents being made to Sri Venkatesvara.  

Krishnadevaraya was succeeded by his brother, Achyutaraya (1S29-1543).  Achyuta was confined to the palace at Chandragiri during the period of his  brother's rule. Immediately after the death of Krishnaraya, he came to Tirumala and had himself crowned there, being bathed with water poured  out of the conch held in the hand of Sri Venkatesvara. He too was a great  devotee of this god. The emperor visited Tirumala in 1533 A.D. accompanied  by his queen, Varadaji and son, Kumara-Venkatadri, and presented many  valuable jewels to the god. He presented some more costly jewels on another  occasion. On 26th December 1535, he instituted a special festival,  named the Lakshmidevi festival, for Sri Venkatesvara and his consort,  Alarmelmanga.  

Sadasivaraya succeeded Achyutaraya. He seems to have visited Tirumala  on two occasions. He came here onc:.e on 3rd February, 1554 and again  in July of the same year and made some gifts to the temple. The rarity of  his visits and comparative poverty of his gifts is due to the fact that he was  dominated by Aliya Ramaraya and was therefore a virtual back number  though for some time he was kept up as the sovereign. Later, Ramaraya  was the real ruler and Sadasiva had to languish in prison.  

*Aravidu dynasty:-*Aliya Ramaraya. who usurped the throne of Vijayanagara casting Sadasiva into prison, played high politics with the contemporary  Sultans of the Deccan and exasperated them with his arrogance and ill-treatment.  

The Sultans combined their armies and invaded the Vijayanagara empire.  Ramaraya opposed them between two villages, named Rakkasi and Tangadi,  in 1565 A.D. In the battle that ensued Ramaraya was killed by an accidental  shot and the ViJayanagara armies were routed.  

Tirumala crowned himself, assuming the title Tirumalaraya, and thus  began the rule of the Aravidu family in 1570 A.D. His name is associated  with part of the Unjal-mantapam, known as the Tirumalaraya-mantapam  in the Sri Venkatesvara temple at Tirumala. Muslim attacks started even  during the short rule of Tirumalaraya. The armies of Bijapur attacked  Anegondi, Adoni and Penugonda but Tirumala, following the policy of  Ramaraya, played the Sultans against each other and averted danger.  

Sriranga I (1572-1585) succeeded him. Six inscriptions of this ruler's time are found in the temples of Tirumala and Tirupati. All of them register  gifts made by private individuals.  

Venkatapati (1585-1614) was the next ruler. He was the governor of  Chandragiri during the two preceding reigns and was also in additional charge  of Udayagiri and Kondavidu. After his accession, he shifted the capital  from Penugonda to Chandragiri. He was a great devotee of Sri Venkatesvara  and set up in the temple at Tirumala statues of himself, his father, Tirumala  and mother, Vengalamba. This monarch is mentioned in fourteen inscriptions  from Tirumala and Tirupati.
