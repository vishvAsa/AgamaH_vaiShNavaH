THE palaeolithic age, in which man fashioned his tools and weapons  by chipping hard stones of convenient size and shape, is represented by the  highly developed Acheulian handaxes discovered at Tirupati, Sitarampeta,  Ellampalle, Mekalavandlapalle, Piler and Ghattu. The Mesolithic (Middle  Stone) age, which was essentially a continuation of the one mentioned above,  is represented by the quartzite tools found at Agraharam, Arayandlapalle,  Chintaparti, Maratavandlapalle and Tirupati. Remains of the neolithic  age have not yet been unearthed.
