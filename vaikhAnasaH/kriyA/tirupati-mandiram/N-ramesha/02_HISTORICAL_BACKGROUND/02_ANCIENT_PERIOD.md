(1. The Mauryas and 2. The Satavahanas:)  

Between the prehistoric and the earliest historical period there is a wide  gap. No direct evidence relating to the early history of Tirumala has so  far come to light. However, the political history of the area, like the other  districts, commences with the Mauryas who extended their sway to the south  after overthrowing the Nandas. After the decline of the Mauryan empire,  the territory, constituting the present Chittoor district, came under the control  of the Satavahanas whose rule lasted for more than four centuries.
