+++

The association of the Cholas with the district of Chittoor continued  for some decades. The rule of Kulottunga III (A.D. 1178-1218) was by no  means weak and he succeeded, in the midst of many troubles, in maintaining  the integrity of the kingdom. The Sambuvarayas, the Kadavarayas, the  Chedirayas and the Yadavarayas constituted the four clans of powerful  feudatories in the region comprising portions of Chittoor and Chcngleput  and the two Arcot districts. The number of feudatories, mentioned in the  inscriptions of Kulottunga's reign, shows how rapidly conditions were changing  for the worse. The reign of his successor, Rajaraja III (A.D. 1216-1260)  was a period of continuous trouble. His inscriptions dated up to the twenty ninth regnal year are found in Chittoor and other neighbouring districts.  This implies that the hegemony of the Cholas continued to be recognised  over the whole of Chittoor in his time. During the reign of the last Chola  ruler, Rajendra III (A.D. 1246-1279), the hold of the Cholas over this district  appears to have weakened, for a number of inscriptions of the Telugu-Pallava  chief Vijayagandagopala come to light. It is generally presumed that  Vijayagandagopala and Kopperunjinga, an ally of the Pandyas shared  Tondamandalam between themselves, the former taking the northern half  and the latter the southern half.
