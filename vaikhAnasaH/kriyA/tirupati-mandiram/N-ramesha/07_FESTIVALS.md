FESTIVALS IN TIRUMALA TEMPLE 


## (i) Introduction. 

THE Tirumala temple is famous from earliest times for the festivals conducted on the hill. Those festivals continue with increasing popularity even up to the present day. 

In ancient days under royal patronage the temple had received gifts and endowments primarily for the worship of the Lord and secondarily for augmenting the grandeur and attraction of the temple and increasing its popularity by means of elaborate festivals and profuse food offerings. Even the construction of spacious and artistic mantapams and imposing prakarams and gopurams were intended only for this purpose. 

The festivals in the temples may be classified into two broad divisions, namely, the basic festivals connected with the ritual of temple worship and which are enjoined by the Sastras and agamas, and auxiliary or secondary festivals according to the nature of this establishment, endowment by devotees etc. The basic festivals are compulsorily being enjoined by the Agamas and the Sastras to be observed at fixed times of the Calendar to coincide with some astronomical data and the omission of which would be considered to be most inauspicious. In fact in many temples, restitution of these festivals once suspended would call for special Suddhi rites. The most popular festival of Tirumala which is known as Brahmotsavam' belongs to this category of basic festivals. 

The secondary or auxiliary types of festivals are individual festivals connected with some incident in the traditional legends about the particular idol in worship in that temple, or they may be connected with some divine incidents about the avatara or incarnation of God etc. Such a festival at Tirumala would be the *tirupallieluchchi' that is the Dhanurmasa festival. Similar would be the festivals that are conducted on the days which coincide with the Nakshatra or birth asterisms of many of the deities. The subsidiary festivals generally would have been instituted by wealthy patrons or by royalty to seek divine grace or to obtain religious merit. Endowments were usually made by them with specific provisions that the proceeds of the endowments should be used for conducting the festivals on the days specified by them. These days generally would be the nakshatra days of the person making the endowment or that of his religious guru or King, or any other relation or some friend. 

In Tirumala temple also the above type of festivals are also celebrated. 


## (ii) The Brahmotsava festival. 

The Brahmotsava festival at Tirumala is the most popular festival drawing huge crowds. This is a basic festival enjoined by the Sastras. The festival bear the name * Brahmotsava ' to commemorate the first Utsavam of the Lord of Tirumala which was conducted by Brahma, the Lord of Creation as per Varaha Purana. This Utsavam is conducted according to the injunctions of the Sastras. 

Prior to 966 A.D., perhaps only one Brahmotsavam was conducted at Tirumala. In 966 A.D., The Pallava Queen Samavai who arranged for the installation of the Bhoga Srinivasa Murthy idol in the temple, made provisions to conduct two Brahmotsava festivals, one in Purattasi month and the other during the Mukkoti Dvadasi period. Thus two Brahmotsavas were being performed from the 10th Century A.D. The same Queen also presented a number of jewels and ornaments including a Kiritam or crown and arranged for endowments for the conduct of the festivals with a procession for the Bhoga Srinivasa Murthy for a few days immediately preceding the main festival as well as during the main festival itself in the month of Purattasi commencing on the day of Chittirai and lasting for nine days. In the same year the same Queen made a further provision for another festival for the same silver idol with two processions each day for seven days prior to Margazhi Tiru Dvadasi that is the Mukkoti Dvadasi. To meet the expenses of these, the Queen endo-wed certain lands to the temples and enjoined on the administrators called the Stanattars to take care to see that no tax was levied on the land granted by her. 

The Chola records make no mention of any of these festivals but a later epigraph enables us to gauge from the increase in quantity and variety of food offerings about the increase in the number and magnitude of the festivals of the temples. Some of the minor feudatories like the Gandagopalas, the Yadavarayas, with Kadavarayas and the Sambhuvarians made gifts and grants to the temple for the perpetuation of nityadeepa and nitya naivedya as well as utsavams for the deities. Thus we find from the evidence of the epigraphs that about 1300 A.D. in addition to the two Brahmotsavams observed in the 10th Century in the months of Purattasi and Margazhi, similar festivals were also performed in the month of Adi at Tirumala for the Lord (189 T. T.), besides the original namely, the festival in Vaikhasi held at Tirupati (111– G.T.). The second festival in Adi was instituted by the Queen of Viranarasimha Yadavaraya, in his 30th regnal year To meet the expenses the Queen granted half the village of 'Paindapalli' of which the other half had already been granted. Besides this she had a four-sided wooden ratha constructed for the deity during the festival, and the expenses for decoration and repairs to this ratha also were ordered by her to be met from the same endowments. The temple administrators were also empowered by her to utilise any unspent balance of the endowment to the repairs of the temple as well. Thus by about the 14th Century A.D. a festival known as Tirukodi Tirunal' or * Brahmotsavam' was conducted three times a year at Tirumala and two times a year at Tirupati. From epigraph 102-T.T. we learn that there were more festivals than one though the precise nature and number of them are not known. 

At the time of Harihara II we learn that this King instituted a fresh festival in the month of masi at Tirumala through the agency of Mullai Tiruvenkata Jeer. The expenses were to be met from the income of the village Pungodu which was endowed by him to the temple (61 and 103-T.T.). From a critical study of the epigraph we can find that as times went on these festivals rose by the middle of the 16th Century to ten a year and they were probably distributed among the ten months of the year with the exception of Vaikasi and Ani in which two festivals were conducted at Tirupati for Sri Govindaraja. 

The Brahmotsavam was celebrated for a period of twelve days counted from the day of ankurarpana (sowing of seeds) of nine kinds of seeds in earthenn vessels to the day of Vidayarru, or the day of preparations for relaxation after the exertions of the temple servants for twelve days during the festival. Each day after the procession was over, the Utsavamurthi was taken away into the temple to a mantapa, installed there in an asthana or an assembly, and was offered the special naivedya provided for the occasion by the devotees. Similar asthanams were also arranged by the devotees to be conducted in the mantapams built in their flower gardens, round the temple to which the Utsavamurthi was taken during the course of the procession before returning to the temple. In fact the asthana formed a feature not only in the brah- motsavam but in other festivals also. 

Till some decades ago the temple conducted four Brahmotsava festivals in a year; the first in purattasi month, the second on the Rathasaptami day, the Third on the Kausika Ekadasi day in the Kartika month and the fourth on Vaikunta Ekadasi or Mukkoti Ekadasi day. The festivals are conducted for several days. The festival during the Rathasapthami period is considered to be an arsha utsava, while that on the Kausika Dvadasi day is considered to be a rakshasic one. The most important of these is the purattasi month Utsavam generally conducted in September-October. The utsavam commences on the day when Sravana Nakshatra is prominent. At present only this festival is conducted. 

On the day before the Sravana star day (thithi) Ankurarpanam is done by sowing 'navadhanya' seeds for germination in specially decorated new pots called 'Palikas.' This is supposed to form part of the propitiatory offerings to the Nityasuris or celestials in the temple. A 'Poorna Kumbham' is also installed in the yagasala. 

The festival actually commences on the first day with the Dhvajarohanam ---a ceremony in which the Lord's flag with the Garuda emblem is flown on a flag staff erected next to the Dhvajastambham. Everyday the Utsavam for the Lord is conducted with splendour, along with homas etc., as per rituals laid down. The Lord's Utsava Vigraham (with or without his consorts Sridevi and Bhudevi) is also taken in procession twice-once in the day time and again in the night time with the appropriate Vahanam. The Vahanams for the processions at night on the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth and tenth days are the Pedda Sesha Vahanam, Hamsa, Simha, Punya Koti Vimanam, Garuda. Elephant, Chandra-Prabha, Aswa, Ivory Palanquin, and Tirucchi Vahanams, respectively. 

The important festival days are the fifth, eighth and eleventh days. The morning procession of the Lord on the 7th day with Surya Prabha Vahanam is also worth seeing. 

156 

The Utsavam on the night of the fifth day is called the Garuda Seva or Garudotsavam. On this day the processional deity alone is taken in procession on the Garuda; the consorts of the Lord are not seated by his side on the Vahanam as usual. On this day, the Lord is given Uyyala Seva" in the evening. This Uyyala Seva or 'Seva in the Swing' takes place in the open area near the Dhvajastambham. The processional deity comes out of the temple in a tiruchi and the poles of the tirucchi are fixed to chain (fixed to the ceiling) with rings attached to them and the whole is swung to and fro during the Swing or Uyyala Seva. During this Asthanam or durbar, songs are sung and Vedic hymns etc. chanted. 

The deity is then taken and installed on the Garuda vehicle. The Makara- kanti ornament and the Lakshmiharam on the Mula-vigraham are then brought and used for the decoration of the Lord on the Garuda vehicle. The vahanam is then taken in procession around the east, west, north and south Mada streets of Tirumalai. The Lord has the usual paraphernalia during this procession such as Chatra, Chamara, Mangala Vadyas, recital of the holy books etc. 

The car festival takes place on the eighth day. This 'Rathotsavam ' attracts the largest crowd during the Brahmotvasam festival days. The Utsavamurthi along with the consorts is brought on to the temple car early in the morning. The Lord in the temple car and the temple car are then gaily decorated; the temple chariot is then taken round the streets of Tirumala. 

On the eleventh day of the festival, the processional deity is taken on a Tirucchi Vahanam to the Swami Pushkarini. The Chakram of the Lord (also called Chakrattalvar) then gets a bath in the Swami Pushkarini. At the same time, the devotees of the Lord also plunge into the Swami Pushkarini. A bath at this time in the Swami Pushkarini is considered to be very holy and merit-giving. The Brahmotsavam comes to an end with this snana or bathing of the Lord in the Pushkarani. 


## (iii) The Adhyayanotsavam. 

From epigraphs we learn that in Tirumala this festival commences ten days prior to the Mukkoti Ekadasi and continues for a period of about 20 days. During this festival the Utsavamurthis are taken out in a procession to the chanting of the Nalayira Prabandham or the hymns of the Srivaishnava Alvars, composed for the benefit of the people not well versed in Sanskrit. The festival was divided into two parts, the earlier 10 days being known as' Pahalpattu' and the later 10 days as 'Irapattu,' which commenced with the Vaikunta Ekadasi or Mukkoti Ekadasi. During the adhyayanotsavam also the devotees provide for naivedyam to the Lord as during the Brahmotsavam. 

The adhyayanotsavam was celebrated for Sri Govindaraja temple and Sri Kodandarama temple in Tirupati also. For five alvars they were observed for a period of 12 days and on the Sattumurai day special offerings were arranged to be made to Lord Venkatesvara first and were then brought down to Tirupati for being offered to Alvars. 

The earliest reference to this festival occurs about 1400 A.D. and the latest by 1635 A.D. 

In olden days one adhyayanotsavam was also performed in front of Sri Ramanuja for twelve days in the month of Chittirai. The Kalyana Manta- pam was utilised for this purpose for housing the Utsavamurthi. The Utsavamurthi Malayappan is to this day kept in the Kalyana Mantapam during the Brahmotsava and Adhyayanotsavam periods. 


## (iv) Pavitrotsavam. 

Many of the annual festivals of the Tirumala temple, for which endowments were made in the past as found in the epigraphs are being continued until this day. But in the case of Pavitrotsavam also for which many references are found in ancient inscriptions, the festival was conspicuous by its absence till 1962 when it was revived. The reason for its discontinuance and why it was given up are not known. 

As its very name implies, this essentially a purificatory ceremony. It is an annual festival. Its object is the expiation of the sins of commission and omission done in the daily worship and other religious rites performed in the temples. 

This purificatory festival is conducted on Sravana Shuddha Dasami day. The festival lasts for four days. This festival was first instituted at Tirumala by Saluva Malliah deva Raja in 1463 A.D. during the time of Saluva Narasimha. (157-TT). This was a completely new festival introduced for the first time and hence full detailed information relating to the ceremony lasting for a period of five days (actually six days if we include the preliminaries of sowing the seeds on the night preceding) is available. The festival comprises also of the recitation of Vedas and the reading of the Puranas during these five days for which the persons employed were especially remunerated. 

The festival being held and introduced for the first time in 1463, A.D., it may be of interest to find the details given in the epigraphs about this. An inscrip-tion is found on the north wall of the verandah in the first prakara of Tirumala Temple and the details are as follows:-- 

May there be prosperity! On Wednesday combined with (the star) Rohini, being the 10th lunar day of the bright fortnight of the Makara month in the Subhanu year, current with the Saka year 1385, the Sthanattar of Tirumalai executed the following silasasanam in favour of Sriman Maha-mandalesvara Medinimiarraganda Kattari-saluva Mallayadeva-Maharaja, son of Saluva Errakampayadeva Maharaja, viz........... 

and for the items of expenditure to be incurred in connection with the celeb- ration of the Tirupavitratirunal, in your name, for five days in in the bright for- tnight of the Avani month, so as to commence with the ankurarpanam sowing the nine kinds of seeds in small earthen pots en the night of the dasami (tenth lunar day), to decorate the Tirumamani-mantapam (the front mantapam adjoining the sanctum) on the Ekadasi day and then seat on the dvadasi day Malaikuniyaninra-Perumal and Nachchimar in the Tirumamani-mantapam, after putting on the pavitram (sanctified thread round the head, neck, waist etc.) and taking Him in procession through the streets, viz., 

103 panam for the somakumbham (water pot), pratimai (images) and yagnopavitam (sacred cord), 

10 panam for the acharya's hasta matra and karna matra (ornaments for the hand and the ears), 

12 panam for dakshina (gift of money), pasu (gift of a cow), kshetram (gift of land) and suvarnam (gift of gold), 

40 panam for the panchasayanam (five articles of bedding) comprising the ratnakambali (carpet), mettai (bed), mayiliraku (peacock's feathers), krishnajinam (deer skin), and pattuchchelai (silk cloth), 

5 panam for the Purana-bhattar and the Brahmans chanting the Vedas; 

10 panam for the dakshina for the above individuals; 

31 panam for the nila-varnam (dyer of the blue colour) for dying (and supplying) red, black and green thread making up the panchavarna-nul (thread of five colours); 

panam for the yellow coloured thread; 

7 panam for the kusavar (potters) for the supply for kumbhakuda (big pot), palikai and other earthen vessels; and... 

8 panam for the achari (smith) to furnish the parvatam (plank with the image of the deity painted on it) and makaratornam (ornamental arch-shaped wooden frame) with two crocodiles represented on it forming the doorway in the function; 

The total coming to 1981 panam 

There are in all only four inscriptions two from Tirumala temple and two from Tirupati temple belonging to the 15th century which mention this festival. There are no other references to it at a later date. It really inexplicable as to how and whẹn such an important purificatory ceremony came to be discontinued in the annual festivals of the temples, the more so, as it is found that it has been performed with all zeal and grandeur in the other important Vaishnava temples like Kanchi, Srirangam etc. 

This festival has been resuscitated in the temple in recent years from 1962 onwards and is now conducted for four days starting from Sravana Shuddha Dasami day. 


## (v) Sankranti. 

The Sankranti festival corresponds to the movement of the sun in the heavens. Of these, the Makara Sankranti and Karkataka Sankranti corres- ponding to the Uttarayana and Dakshinayana Punyakalas are specially observed universally. Vishu Sankrantis corresponding to the vernal and autumnal equinoxes are less important. Still all these occasions together with amavasya days are considered to be very holy ones, and hence these have been observed in the temples also. 

Many devotees have made endowments for special worship during these days. The first such endowment belongs to queen Samavai of 966 A.D. (18-TT) where she has made an endowment for worship on two ayana Sankrantis and the two vishu Sankrantis. Ever since this, during centuries endowments for special worship by the devotees have been increasing on the Sankranti days. In one case, we have the full and the new moon days on which occur the Soma Surya grahanam which are called Vishesha divasamgal as distinct from tingal-divasamgal which regularly occur in a routine manner every month. 

160 

Our special interest would be the Adi-Ayana in the administrative arrange- ments of the temple since this formed the new accounting year of the temple when the old registers were discarded and new registers of accounts commenced to be written on. The Adi-Ayana is consequently mentioned in these epigraphs with reference to this function as in the expressions: 

tiru andeluitu idum podu (66-GT) 

tiruvandeluttu satti arulum podu (195 GT) 

tiruvandeluttitta-taruvayile (58-G.T.) 

etc. etc. 

(vi) Vasantotsavam am Grishmotsavam. 

The Lord of the universe is conceived by man in his own image and hence the Lord partakes also of the man's festivals like Vasantotsavam (Spring festival), Grishmotsavam (summer festival), Unja! Tirunal (swinging festival) and the tiruppali-odam-tirunal (the floating festival). 

During spring season or Vasanta ritu in the month of Vaikashi the Brahmotsavam of Sri Govindaraja of Tirupati is celebrated, on the 6th day of which the Vasantotsavam is celebrated with a procession of the Lord during the main streets. Nowadays, there is a function in the evening and special chandanam is distributed. From epigraphs we learn that a large quantity of chandanam was used for the festival in the past. Hence this distribution of sandalwood paste would appear to be an ancient custom. 

Since Vasantotsavam is coupled with Brahmotsavam and occurs on the 6th day of the Brahmotsavam, this utsavam also got doubled as the Brahmotsavam was increased to two in the 13th century, till the middle of the 16th century, when two more Brahmotsavam were instituted when this also got automatically increased. A similar auxiliary Vasantotsavam was arranged for the last two days of the Kodai-tirunal during the reign of Krishnadevaraya (311-TT). 

Besides this auxiliary Vasantotsavam, there seems to have been celebrated another Vasantotsavam as a main festival by itself, lasting for three days in the month of Chittirai, from the day of the star Chittirai, ¿.e., Chitra, which would coincide with the purnima or the full-moon day (No. 105-G.T.). During the time of Achyutaraya, a fresh Vasantotsavam was started in Saka 1460, Vilambi, by one Periya-Solai, son of an accountant in the temple at Tirumala, by instituting a fund of 3000 narpanam (No. 345-G.T.) The preliminary rite of ankurarpanam (sowing the nine kinds of seeds) was required to be done on the day of Uttirattadi or Uttarabhadra star in the month of Panguni and the Sattumurai (the last) day was to fall on the day of Kartikai or Krittika star such that the tirunal was celebrated for a period of four days. 

Since these festivals were not primary and obligatory ones, they could be increased and modified to any extent to which the devotees desired and consequently we find variation in them. 


## (vii) Kodai-Tirunal. 

The Kodai-tirunal was a summer festival, just as Vasantotsavam was one pertaining to the spring season. It was celebrated for a period of twenty days divided into two halves. It was conducted both at Tirumala for Sri Malaiyappan (the processional image of Sri Venkatesvara), His two divine consorts and Senai Mudaliyar (No. 311-T.T.) and in Tirupati for Sri Govinda- raja (Nos. 105-G.T., 277 and 281-T.T.). No. 251-G.T., dated in Saka 1454, Khara, records a Kodai festival for Sri Periya-Raghunathan, i.e., Sri Kodanda- Rama, during the month of Ani. 

This festival is mentioned for the first time in an incomplete epigraph found on the west wall of the mukkoti pradakshinam. It is in the 17th regnal year of an unknown king, and it makes provision for a donation of 400 panams, the interest from which is intended to be used for this festival. The inscription, paleographically, would be of the 12th or 13th century A.D. 

This festival was also being performed during the administration of the temple by the Mahants. It is not being performed at present. 


## (viii) Anna Unjal Tirunal. 

Besides these Vasanta and Kodai festivals, there is also the Anna-unjal (swan-shaped swing) tirunal, and the Tiruppali-odam-tirunal (floating festival) conducted for the processional images. The Anna-unjal festival was started in the Tirumala temple by Saluva Narasimha in Saka 1395, Vijaya, and was stipulated to be celebrated for a period of five days virtually, but actually for seven days (No. 197 T.T.). It was essential to commence this festival with the ankurarpanam, as in the case of the Vasantotsavam, on the night preceding the main days of the festival, which was fixed to be done on the sixth day of the bright fortnight in the month of Chittirai. All articles required for the bath, worship, offerings and procession were enumerated seriatim, as well as the rites of homam, punyaham and antya-homam at the end of the fifth day. Special offerings on a grand scale were provided for both day and night. 

For the expenses of these and other items, Saluva Narasimha granted the village of Dammarapatti in Kalavai-parru, a sub-division of Padaividu-rajya, 

Not only was this Unjal-utsavam separately instituted as a main festival, but it was annexed to the Kodai-tirunal on its tenth day, and further arranged as a one day's function on the Sankramam (i.e., the Makara-sankramam or the winter-solstice day) by Saluva Narasimha himself, on the above occasion, the total unjal days aggregating to nine (No. 197-T.T.). 

The Unjal festival, when once it was established in the Tirumala temple by Saluva Narasimha for Sri Malaiyappa, became a desideratum in Tirupati in the case of Sri Govindaraja. Consequently in Saka 1430 Appa-Pillai, son of Karavattipuliyalvar of the Koundinya-gotra and Apastamba-sutra, a resident of Mahipalakulakalachcheri, a part of Rajendrasola-chaturvedi-mangalam alias Sriman-Uttaramerur, instituted a Unjal-tirunal for Sri Govindaraja, commencing with the ankurarpanam on the day of the Chitra star occurring in the month of Adi and closing with the Sattumurai on the day of Uttarashada (No. 265-G.T.). The festival therefore lasted for 8 days and adequate provision, was made for its regular conduct through the supply of all the necessary articles and services which were also remunerated. 

This festival is not being conducted in the temple at present. 


## (ix) Tiruppali-odam-Tirunal. 

Inscription No. 197-T.T., which records the institution of the Unjal festival at Tirumala by Saluva Narasimha, mentions that a Tiruppaliodattiruna. (floating festival) was also conducted as the dharmam of Saluva Narasimha, and that provision was made for offering four appa-padi on the occasion. 

References to the swinging and the floating festivals occur in later records. Nos. 271-T.T. dated in Saka 1426 and 97-G.T. dated in Saka 1445 state that the Unjal festival was celebrated for a period of five days, in the two temples. But the references to the Tiruppaliodam point out to a one day's festival as in Nos. 281-T.T. and 256-G.T., while in No. 97-G.T. it is said to form a day's function, being affixed to the Kodai festival on its 10th day, and in No. 83- T.T., dated in Saka 1445, Vijaya, it is stated that the Jalakridai-tiruppalio- dattirunal was to be conducted for nine days in the Achyutarayar-Koneri. As the agamas do not specify any dates for these festivals, they came to be celebrated at the convenience of the founders. 

163 


## (x) Jayanti festivals. 

Another source of accretion to the festivals in temples is furnished by the provision made for celebrating the birth day or the birth-asterism of several deities. The Jayantis of the different avataras, such as Sri Ramanavami, Sri Krishnashtami, Sri Narasimhajayanti etc., are observed annually on parti- cular days, while, in the case of the presiding deities of the several temples, the birth-asterism is of greater moment, and on the day on which it occur. each month, special worship is provided; such as the days of the stars Sravanam in the case of Sri Venkatesvara (No. 33-T.T.), Punarvasu for Sri Rama (No. 280-T.T.,) Uttara for Sri Govindaraja (No. 47-G,T.), Rohini for Sri Krishna (No. 47-G.T.), etc. 

Closely akin to the above are those festivals in temples which were instituted by devotees for conducting special worship to the deities on each anniversary day of the birth-asterism of certain great men, such as the alvars (saints), acharyas (spiritual teachers), kings, princes, and ruling chiefs, and rich men and other devoted persons who were anxious about invoking the blessings of the Almighty upon them on the particular day each year for a long and prosperous life. Special worship including food-offerings and processions were arranged on these occasions. 

Besides, certain other days, such as the Tai-Amavasya, Ani-Amavasya, Dipavali, Kartikai, Yugadi, Maha-Navami, Ratha-Saptami, etc., which are held sacred by the Hindu public, were also made festive occasions on which the deities were propitiated with offerings and taken out on some vehicles in procession. 

(xi) Kalyana Utsavam. 

The Kalyanotsavam is usually performed in the Kalyana Mantapam or the Tirumala Nayaka Mantapam. In this Utsavam the marriage of Sri Malayappan with his brides Sri Devi and Bhudevi is performed. This is an impressive ceremony and begins with the Panchamurthi Puja following the Vaikhanasa Agama rituals. The marriage is done with Mangala Sutra Dharana according to Vedic rites. The 'thalambralu' ceremony is also performed as in regular marriages. The Nachchiyars and the Lord are then garlanded. 

This is purely an arjitham festival i.e., one which is conducted on payment of the scheduled fees. The donor is honoured at the end with a vastram from the temple. All the devotees present at the temple are given a dakshina of few paise along with the Lord's * Akshatalu.' 

164 

FESTIVALS IN TIRUMALA TEMPLE 

No inscription however gives any details of the marriage festival until we reach the year 1546 A.D. In that year Tallapakam Tirumala Ayyangar conceived the idea of celebrating a marriage festival of five days for Malayappan on the lines of a Hindu marriage. The festival was celebrated in the month of Panguni at a cost of 500 ghatti Varahas. As the Kalyana mantapam was not then in existence, the festival was conducted in the Tirumamani mantapam. The details given in the epigraph (No. 669-T. T.) are as follows. 

On the first day there was the preliminary function of Sadyonkura Ankurarpanam. Soma pratima, Brahma pratima, etc., were consecrated for the ceremony. Then Malaikuniya ninra perumal and the two Nachchimars (Bhudevi and Neela Devi) were given Tirumanjanam or bath of rose water in the Tirumamani mantapam. This was followed by a procession through the streets. On return the bridegroom was seated on a Unjal or swing plank in front of the Tirumamani mantapam and the Nachchimars were seated one on a Chataka pakshi vahanam and the other on a Hamsa Vahanam. Garlands were exchanged between the bridegroom and the two brides in the same way as in the case of a Hindu marriage. The Nachchimars were next placed on either side of Malaikuniya ninra perumal on the swing plank. Their feet were washed with milk and harti pancha varna pidi1were offered to them. In the Abhijit lagnam, the Deities were removed to the Tirumamani mantapam and all the articles required for the muhurta homam were brought. These consisted chiefly of clothes for the Nachchimars, Sandal paste and Sambhavana for putting on the Tirukkappunaan (consecrated string round the wrist?) and a cloth to serve as a screen between the bridegroom and the brides. 

(xii) Ratha Sapthami Festival. 

This is a well known festival celebrated at sun rise on the Magha Suddha Saptami tithi. It is considered a Visesha Divasam which is generally celebrated in all Vishnu temples. It is first mentioned in an inscription of the year 1564. This is probably because no endowment was made for it till 1564 A.D.(No. 376– G. T.) 

In the year 1538 A.D. one Tiruvanantalvar Kuppayyan made an endow. ment of 700 panams from the income of which a Ratha Saptami festival was to be celebrated for Sri Govindarajaswami on the Sukla Saptami day in the month of Tai. On this occasion there was a Tirumanjanam and procession in Suryaprabha along with Nachchimar and Senai mudaliar. 

165 

THE TIRUMALA TEMPLE 

In Tirumala, it does not appear from the inscriptions that this festival was celebrated before 1564 A.D. In that year however one Karnikkar Appalayyar made an endowment of the village of Sengalleru in Gandi- kkottai sirmai yielding an annual income of 150 Rekkai pon. Out of this a sum of 34 R.P. and 5 panams were to be spent for the celebration of a Ratha Saptami festival in Tirumala. This festival is described in detail in the inscription as follows. 

On the night before the festival, sumptuous food offerings were made to Periya Perumal. At day break on the day of the festival, Brahma Senapati was propitiated with Bali offerings. Then Tiruvalialvan (Chakrattalvar) went round the streets and bali offerings were made at the right corners of the village (points of the compass). Homam was next performed in the temple and Tirumanjanam was given to Malai ninra perumal and the Nachchimars. The latter were then taken in procession in Suryaprabha vahanam through the streets. After returning to the Tirumamani Mantapam, Churnabhishekam was done. Tiruvali alvan was next taken to Sri Varahaswami temple where Tirtha (bathing in the Swami pushkarini) was offered by Tiruvalialvan, There was also a night procession on Vaikunta Vimanam and food offerings. It will be noticed that this festival in Tirumala was conducted on a grander scale than in Tirupati, although in the latter place the festival had an earlier start. 

The present day celebration of the festival in Tirumala is more elaborate. The daily Tiruvaradhanam of Periya Perumal is completed before day break and before the Utsavamurthi is taken out for the Suryaprabha procession. After the street procession with the Deity mounted in Suryaprabha is over, three more processions take place with the Deity mounted on the small Sesha Vahanam, Garuda Vahanam and Hanumanta Vahanam. It is only after completing these processions that Tiruvali alvan goes to Sri Varahaswami temple and offers Tirthavari. The second Archana and Naivedyam of Periya Perumal take place after the Tirthavari. Thereafter while the pilgrims are having darsan of the Periya Perumal, the Utsava Murti goes again in procession mounted successively on the Sarva Bhupala Vahanam, Kalpavriksha Vahanam and Chandraprabha. Thus seven processions on seven vahanams take place before sunset. It is not possible to state when these developments took place. 

(xiii) Lakshmi Devi Mahotsavam. 

The festival was first instituted by Achutaraya Maharayar in the year 1535 A.D. It was intended to celebrate the union of Tiruvengadamudaiyan with Alarmelmangai Nachchiyar as stated in the inscription (No. 54),

FESTIVALS IN TIRUMALA TEMPLE 

The festival was to commence with Ankurarpanam (seed sowing ceremony) in Uttirattadi Nakshatram and to end with Sathumurai in Rohini nakshatram (six days in all). In the post-script, the name Lakshmidevi Mahotsavam is given to the festival. The cost of celebrating the festival was 300 rekhai pon This expenditure was to be borne by the King by assigning the Uttarayam income of Kondavidu Simai every year. 

All the customary rituals connected with a five day festival with the exception of flag hoisting and Tirthavari, were provided for. Pratimas (or images in gold) of Brahma, Soma, Sesha and others for the Brahma mandalam and Lakshmi were made and installed. The special features were the daily recital of Sri Sukta, Kalpa mantram, Lakshmi Sahasra namam and Lakshmi Gayatri japam. Homam was also performed daily and for this havis payasa charu and various kinds of foods were provided. Dakshina was given to the Acharya, the Ritviks and to those who recited the Vedas and read the Puranas, Some sumangalis (married women) were also given dakshina and clothes. There was procession every day and food offerings were made in the seven mantapams constructed to commemorate the names of Achyutaraya, Varadaji- amman and their sons. The festival continued to be celebrated till the year 1562 A.D. and endowments were made for food offerings on the festival days by Aravidu Tirumalarajayya and Sottai Tirumalai nambi Srinivasa Ayyangar. Thereafter we lose sight of the festival. 

In Tirupati also, a similar festival was celebrated from about 1537 A.D. (No. 258-G.T.). But it seems to have been a one day festival on the Suklapaksha navami day before the Vijayadasami. 

(xiv) Pallavotsavam. 

This festival was instituted in 1545 A.D., by Sriman Mahamandalesvarar Vittalesvara Maharaja, son of Araviti Bukkaraja Ramaraja Timmarajayya He made a grant of three villages with an aggregate annual income of 1000 rekhai pon for various purposes. Out of this amount 492 R.P. was to be expended for the celebration of Pallavotsavam. was arranged to be celebrated in the month of Vaikasi so as to have the Sattumurai in Rohini Nakshatra which was the janma nakshatra of the donor. The festival commenced in the same manner as the other festivals with Ankurarpana sthapana, Tirumanjanam, Homam, Pancha havis, Namarchana, the recital of Vedas and the Tamil Prabandhams and the reading of Puranas. There were asthanams, naivedyam in asthanams, procession of the Utsavamurti with the Nachchimars round the streets, returning to the bed chamber etc.

THE TIRUMALA TEMPLE 

For the performance of homam at the time of the ankurarpanam the usual images,-Sesha and Jayadi images, Brahma, garuda, eight varuna images, the images of the nine planets and one for the stars--were duly made and installed. Acharya and Ritviks were engaged and paid. It is seen that the festival continued to be celebrated till 1562 A. D. (No. 428-G.T.) an other donors also made endowments for food offerings on the five days of the festival. 

(xv) Phalotsavam. 

This five days festival was not the same as Pallavotsavam. It is really a festival of fruits. Sottai Tirumalainambi Srinivasa Ayyangar made this festival from one of the items of his endowment of the grant of Periya Ekkalur village in Gutti Sirmai. It was celebrated on the same lines as the other festivals. It commenced with ankurarpanam; all the usual images were made and installed. Homams were offered every day. There were the Acharya, the Ritviks, the recital of Namarchana, the reading of Tiruvenkatamahatmyam and the recital of Vedas and Prabandhas, etc. The Muhurtam, or auspicious moment for commencing the festival was fixed by an astrologer. But its distinguishing feature was the offering of large quantities of fruits, wild as well as cultivated ones, to the deity and their free distribution to the members of the congregation. Mangoes, jack fruits, coconuts, wood apples, the two varieties of jambu fruits, kilikkirinji fruits, kommadi madalam fruits, kama- mattam, muralam, palai and plantain fruits were offered and distributed. In this manner the total number of fruits offered every day amounted to 1200. During the festival, the Tirumanjanam of the Utsavar and Nachchimar took place in the Ulagamundan flower garden mantapam. The festival was celebrated for five days in the Tamil month of Masi; the ankurarpanam started in the Punarvasu nakshatram and the Sathumurai în the Puram nakshatram. There is also an endowment for food offerings in connection with this festival in 1562 A.D. 

(xvi) Visesha Tirunal and tingal divasàms during 

ages in Tirumala. 

Epigraphs which are our main source of information give us valuable information about the details of the festivals conducted in the temple 

No. 633-T.T. and No. 428-G.T. give full and complete details about the several festivals conducted on different dates for Lord Venkatesvara at Tirumala as follows:- 

168 

FESTIVALS IN TIRUMALA TEMPLE 

10 Brahmotsavam running for 14 days each with the processional Images seated on each of the 14 days în the unja-mantapam constructed by Tirumalaraya opposite to the Dhvajastambham (flag-staff) in the Sampangi-Pradakshinam, the second circumambulatory passage, as a renovation and enlargement of Saluva Narasimha's mantapam: 

The Anna-Unjal tirunal (lightly swinging on the swan - shaped sea-saw of the three processional Images) for 5 days, instituted by Saluva Narasimha in 1473 (No. 197-T.T.); 

The Pavitrotsavam (purificatory ceremonial festival) for 5 days (înstituted by Saluva Mallayadeva Maharaja in 1464 (No. 157 – T.T.). 

The Sahasra-nama-archana festival (actually Ashtottara-Sahasra- nama, 1008 appellations through the utterance of which Venkatesvara is invoked in worship), to run for 5 days; Nowadays these 1008 names are recited during the forenoon Archana worship with flowers and tulasi, every day; and probably in the 16th century it was not in practice, and only Ashtottara-sata-nama, 108 names, were recited; hence a new festival with 1008 names recitation was perhaps inaugurated then). 

The Sahasra-Kalasa-Abhishekam festival for I day only (the ceremonial ablutions of the processional images with water filled in 1008 small silver vessels). This is an Arjita festtival now, i.e., conducted by the temple only on payment of the prescribed fee by any devotee, and not one performed as a routine by the temple. The fee for it is now Rs. 2,500'- No. 428-G.T. provided an offering to Venkatatturaivar(Ugra-Srinivasa) on this day. 

The Adhyayanotsavam for 25 days in Margali month with the recitation of several parts of the Tamil-Prabandham; 

The Vasantotsavam, the spring festival for 5 days, instituted by Tirumalarajayya; 

The Damana-arohana-Vasantotsavam with the covering of the bodies of the Images with the sweet-smelling damana herbs, for 5 days in Ani; 

The Unjal festival for 9 days; 

The Pendli-tirunal or Vaivahikotsavam, marriage festival for 5 days (instituted by Tallapaka Tiruvenkatanatha alias Chinnanna in 1546 (No. 669- T. T.), 

169 


        The Lakshmidevi festival for 5 days. 


        The Kodai-tirunal, summer festival, for 20 days; 


        The float festival for 9 days; 


        The Pallavotsavam for 5 days; 


        The Phalotsavam for 3 days; 


        The Adhyayanotsavam for Udaiyavar (Ramanuja) for 6 days; 

These 15 festivals, other than the 10 Brahmotsavams, are termed Visesha- Tirunal, special or extra festivals. 

There are tingal-divasam (monthly days) occurring in each month of the year, on which special worship and offerings were arranged for the different deities:- 

12 Masa-Sankramams, monthly solstices, the first days of the 12 Tamil months; 

13 Amavasyas (new-moon days); 

13 Paurnamis (full-moon days); 

25 Dasamis (10th lunar days of the bright and dark fortnights). 

25 Ekadasis (11th lunar days of both the fortnights); 

25 Dvadasis (12th lunar days of the two fortnights); 

13 days of each of the stars such as Rohini, Mrigasirsha, Punarvasu, Pushyami, Uttara-Phalguni, Mula, Purvashadha, Uttarashadha, and Sravanam. 

Likewise there are visesha-divasam, single religious and festivity days in the year, on which worship and offerings were provided to the deities, such as Sri-Jayanti, Uri-Adi, Utthana-Dvadasi, Arpasi-Purvashadha, Dipavali, Kartikai, Makara-Sankramam, Padiyavettai, Tai-Pusam, Tannir-amudu, Ugadi, Sri Rama Navami, Vaikasi-Visakha and Masi-Makha. 

Besides these days, some devotees made provision for offerings and special worship and even for a festival and procession on the days of their own birth-stars. 

Tingal divasams are certain special days of monthly occurrence and are either certain tithis of the bright or dark fortnight, or are days of certain nakshatrams occurring every month. For purposes of celebrating festivals the tithi or nakshatram is determined by the same rules as for Vratams. Visesha divasams are days in which a tithi or nakshatra in a particular month occurs. They commemorate the birth asterism of alvars or acharyas, the avatara nakshatra (day of manifestation) of the incarnations of Vishnu or days commemorating great events. 

The earliest mention of Visesha divasam occurs in an inscription of the year 1308 A.D. In this inscription it is stated that Snapana Tirumanjanam was performed for Tiruvengadam Udaiyan on the days of Kaisika Tirudvadasi, Margali, Tirudvadasi, Sankramanam and Chittirai Vishu. Subsequently in an inscription of the year 1488 A. D. (No. 142-G. T.) the monthly occurrence of the birth asterisms of certain acharyas and others are referred to as Tingal divasams. 

Among Visesha divasams the following are mentioned in the inscription- Adiayanam, Arpisi Vishu, Makra Sankramanam, and Chittirai Vishu; Sri- ayanti, Mahanavami, Tirukkartigai, Kanu, Tiruppudiyadu, Tai Amavasya Panguni, Uttiram, Vaikhasi Visakham, and days of solar and lunar eclipse. On these days Tirumanjanam was offered. These appear to be in consonance with present day classification also. In 1504 A.D.(No. 271-T.T)we find that some more days were added. These are Arpisi Puradam (the birth asterism of Senai Mudaliar), Ani Puradam, Ani Pusam, Sri Rama Navami and Vastana Purnami. 

A fairly comprehensive list appears in an inscription of the year 1562 A.D which gives full details as follows:-

            Grand Total 12 

The number of days of visesha Tirunals was 204, of Tingal divasams 217; and of Visesha divasams 12 days. The total of all these is 433 days in a year of 365 days. There should therefore have been many overlappings. 

The visesha divasams as devised in 1819 A.D. when the East India Company took over the temple, as seen from archival record were (1) Anivara-Asth- anam (the commencement of Adi month) with food offering of 114 seers rice (2) Varalakshmi Vratam (a new item) (3) Sravana-Pournami; (4) Gokulashtami (not Sri Jayanti) (5) Utla festival (for Ugadi) (6) Vinayaka Chaturthi (a new festival) (7) Anantha Chaturdasi (a new festival) (8) Dipavali Asthanam

From the above list it will be seen that many visesha festivals were classified as visesha divasams and that eight new festivals were added most of the" latter' showing a distinét non-vaishnava influence in the administration of the temple. The taşdik provision for food offerings on these days was also reduced considerably, 

The present day arrangement is as follows:-
