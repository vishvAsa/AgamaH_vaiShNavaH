The idol of the Lord, a Vaishnavaite or Saivaite one. 

There has been a persistent controversy going on, whether the image of the Lord at Tirumala is a manifestation of Vishnu or Siva. There is also a view that it represents Subramanya and another extreme view that the idol represents Shakti. These are questions which time and again agitate the minds of devotees and pilgrims who intensely believe in the sanctity of this great temple. It is therefore necessary that this should be examined in detail and settled once and for all. 


## An examination whether the idol of the Lord is a Saivite idol. 

In support of the school that the image of the Lord is that of Siva, the following reasons are generally adduced. 

(a) The Lord's Makuta or crown which is more than 20 inches high, is richly adorned with flowing locks of hair or Jata Juta with some of the locks of curly hair resting on the shoulders. 

(b) The arms have armlets with finger-like projections which appear to be Nagabhushanam and a Naga is depicted as coiled around the Lord's right arm. 

(c) The puja is done in the temple with bilva leaves which are used only in the archana to Lord Siva. 

(d) There is a crescent mark on the head of the Lord which also indicates that the idol is that of Lord Siva. 

(e) The Lord is in the centre of the Garbha griha, and therefore it is a Saivite murti. 

(ƒ) A crystal Lingam is present in the Tirumala temple which proves that the temple was in ancient days a Saivite one and later converted to Vaishnava worship after the reforms in the temple like nityarchana, etc, by Sri Ramanuja. 

The above views are totally untenable. 

In the first place it is incorrect to state that the Lord's makuta has a jatajuta which resembles that of the image of Lord Siva. The main characteristics of the Dhruva Bera of Sri Venkatesvara are as follows: 

(i) Sri Devi on the right breast seated on the Sri Vatsa. 

(ii) The scars on the shoulders. 

(iii) Free and easy posture of the two upper hands into which Sankham and Chakram have subsequently been placed. 

(iv) The varada posture of the lower right hand and the Katyavalambita posture i.e., holding the hand inner to the left of him of the lower left hand. 

It must be admitted that the varada posture i.e., the palm and the fingers pointing downwards is not associated with any of the agama forms of stanakamurti. As already explained above, the idol of the Lord is Svayambhu or self-maintaining or if any rational interpretation of the agama texts is to be given, the idol must have been made at a time when the agamic texts were not codified and hence this must be one of the most ancient idols of the Country The palm and the fingers of the idol are open and point downwards to the right foot significantly reminding a devotee of the Supreme grace of the Lord to grant all boons to the worshippers who seek refuge at the feet of the Lord. This seems to have a bearing on the boon granted unasked to Mahabali by the Lord. Nammaivar makes a reference to this episode. Sri Alavandar, the great Vaishnava saint in his stotraratnam also praises the Lord and prays that the Lord's feet should be placed on his head. In the Trivikrama pose of Lord Vishnu, he points to his right foot, to ask Bali as to what he has to offer, after all the entire universe had been measured up by the Lord in two steps. At that stage, Mahabali who had nothing else to offer offered his head, and Trivikrama bestowed on Mahabali the highest boon which a human soul could ask or aspire for viz., absorption into the holy feet of the Lord. This seems to be the explanation of the Varada posture of the idol at the time when the agamic texts were not codified. 

The position in the fingers and specially that of the thumb of the left hand in the hip and the thigh suggests that the Kodanda bow of Srirama which was deemed to have passed inside of the thumb should be maintained in a steady position. 

Another important feature of the idol is the *pralambasutra *and the katisutra, the former the sacred thread or Yagnopavitam and the latter the string round the loin called in Telugu, *molatadu.' They characterise Sri Vishnu alone. 

That the idol is undoubtedly that of Vishnu and not of Siva can be inferred from the following: 

(a) The Kaustubha hanging centrally in the Chest is a characteristic of Sri Vishnu. This is also described in the ancient Tamil classic Silappadhikaram, and this is as old as the early Christian eras. 

(b) According to the agamic rules a Kautuka bera should be an exact representation of the Dhruva Bera. A close examination of the Kautuka Bera of Tirumala will establish that it is undoubtedly that of Lord Vishnu only. 

(c) Factually, there is nothing like a Nagabharanam, on the form of the idol of Dhruvamurti. The gold ornament or plating worn on the arm is a subsequent present made by devotees. Naga or adisesha is invariably associated with Vishnu and the mantrapushpam which is daily recited in the temple makes reference to this. 

(d) There is also factually, no jata on the head of the idol of the murti of the Lord. There is also no Srichakram or yantra on the kiritam of the Idol. 

(e) Even Acharya purushas do not enjoy the privilege of closely inspecting the Druva Bera. So far as one could observe the idol from Kulasekhara padi to which only entrance is given to a devotee, and based on the evidence of the most observant archakas over a number of years, it can be factually ascertained that there is no serpant anywhere in the garbha griha, not to speak of its total absence of the body of the Deity. Somehow a misrepresentation has been created for long that this exists on the body of the idol, and this misrepresentation still persists though factually it is incorrect and inaccurate. 

(ƒ) The so called simhalalata is only an ordinary ornamentation jewel including those which cover the crucial parts of the parts of the idols of the Lord and his consort. What exists on the idol is only a rough delineation which can by no account be associated with the face of a lion. This kind of ornamentation can be seen on many idols. 

(g) The nagabharana is not an ornament integral with the body of the Lord and it connotes nothing in particular. The naga is one of the nityas ever present with Vishnu. 

(h) Bilva leaf with which puja is done is not exclusive to Saivite worship alone. It can be used as one of the eight punya pushpas even in the worship of Lord Vishnu. 

The following authorities prove the fact:- 

(i) Padmasamhita 12th Adhyaya (Charyapada) 

(ii) Brigu Samhita 

Both the agamas recommend the use of the bilva in the worship of Vishnu. Hence there is no special significance about the bilva leaf being used in the worship leading to an inference that the idol at any time was that of Lord Siva. On the other hand the fact that it is not used along with tulasi leaves so sacred to Vaishnava worship is a pointer that the bilva is used along with eight punya pushpas acceptable to Lord Vishnu. 

(i) The Agamic rules for the installation of stanaka asina or sayanamurti of Vishnu clearly lay down that the Dhruva bera should occupy the daivic seat. The image of the Lord is precisely in this seat. There is thus no force in saying that because the Lord is in the centre of the Garbha Griha it should be a saivite one. 

(j) The place of Yogalakshmi and Sri Vatsam on the idol of the Lord follow the exact rules given in Bhrigu Samhita, Lakshmi Kalpam, according to which Lakshmi should be in the upper portion of the right breast above the Srivatsam. The markings of Srivatsam depend on the rupam or form of the particular murti and there is no fixed rule about it. Broadly speaking Srivatsam represents the Mula prakriti and Lakshmi, the Abhishtana Devata, and the position of Lakshmi on the idol of the Lord closely follows this. 

(k) So far as one could see there is no crystal Lingam anywhere in the Tirumala temple. Sometimes Sri Vidyaranya is said to have mentioned this. Sri Vidyaranya was a contemporary of Vedanta Desika who lived about 14th Century A.D. The temple has nearly 600 years of history of recorded inscriptions before that date and nowhere has a crystal Lingam been mentioned. 

(l) About the association of Kapila, which is represented by the Kapileswara temple situated at the foot of the Hills, also, no signi- ficance need be attached since Kapila, Bhrigu, Ganesa, Durga, Siva and Brahma are all upadevatas in a Vaishnava temple according the Vaishnava agamas, 

(m) The outlet from the Gomukham, the height of the garbha griha etc., are all sometimes mentioned as proof of its being a saivite temple. These are all based on misconceptions as the architecture of the temple has evolved through many centuries. 

Actually there is an outlet on the gomukha of the garbha griha and for various reasons it has not been working. The height of the garbha griħa is a distinct and different proportion of the height of the murti and this rule has been closely observed in this case. Similarly the height of the dhruva bera pitha is consistently proportionate to the bhuvanga or height of the entrance. 

It can therefore be conclusively stated that the idol of the Lord can by no standards be mistaken for that of Lord Siva, either now or at any earlier time. 


## An examination whether the idol of the Lord is a Sakti idol 

Sometimes it is stated that the temple was originally that of a Goddess and the idol represents  Durga or some sort of Sakti. The reasons adduced for this view are as follows: 

(a) The temple is called by North Indians as Balaji temple and since Durga is known as Bala the idol of the Lord must be Durga or Sakti. 

(b) Tirumala Hill is called Meruchakram which is in the form of Devi or Sakthi. 

(c) Galigopuram is known as Kali Gopuram, and hence is a gopuram to Kali or Sakthi. 

(d) On the top of the central vimana a couchant lion which is the vehicle and the emblem of the Sakti is seen. 

(e) The 'drapery' of the Lord which is called in Tamil Ulchattu ' is very long and resembles a sari and hence this proves the Deity as a Goddess viz., Durga or Sakti. 

(ƒ) Sandal paste is used in worship which also indicates the idol is that of Goddess. 

(g) Turmeric which is a peculiarity feminine cosmetic is used in the abhisheka. Also certain types of offerings to the Lord show that it is more consistent to hold that the idol is that of Durga or Sakti at any rate at an early date. 

(h) A verse in Devi Bhagavatam describes the Lord as Sri Venkateswari, the only deity of Kali yuga. 

(i) The abhishekam of the mula vigraha is done only on Fridays, which is a mangala snana day prescribed for women. 

(j) Thomalaseva is called Bhagavati aradhana and hence the worship is really that of Sakti. 

(k) Sri Sukta mantras are recited during the abhisheka of the Lord which again proves a saktheya type of worship. 

The above reasons which are generally used as proof that the idol of the Lord is that of Durga of Sakti do not bear any close scrutiny. 

They are untenable for the following reasons: 

(a) above: The fact that North Indians call the Lord as Balaji is of very recent origin as can be seen from the inscriptions of the temple. There is no mention of the word 'Balaji' anywhere in any inscription or any literary reference to the temple before the 17th Century A.D. In fact, North Indians commenced going to Tirupati only from the days of Shivaji č.e., in the middle of the 17th century A.D. and hence the North Indians' description of the Lord can have no bearing whatsoever on the antiquity of the temple. 

Alternatively Sri Vishnu is closely associated with the Krishnavatara where Lord Krishna is shown as an infant. In the Bhagavata the words “*Tamadbhutam Balakamambujekshanam*” occurs in describing the darshan which Sri Krishna gave to his father soon after his birth. It is possible that the word Balaji may be derived not from Bala, which is a synonym for Durga, but from Balaka which is the name in the Bhagavata to Krishnavatara with which this temple is closely associated. 

In any case no serious reliance could be placed on this argument since North Indian influx to the temple is only of very recent origin, and till the time of the Vijayanagara period, we have no information that the temple used to attract pilgrims of the North in such numbers as now. 

(b) above: The range of the Hills has always been called Vengadam. Even the name of Seshachalam is of recent origin. Hence the shape of Meruchakram which is in the form of Devi has no relevance to the Hill which is always known as Vengadam and the Lord as Venkatachalapati. 

(c) above: There is clear epigraphical evidence that the galigopuram itself was constructed only in 1628 A.D. by a Sri Vaishnava by name Matla Anantaraja whose name is also given in the inscription. The builder is a well known Srivaishnava and it is inconceivable that he would have built in a Vaishnava Temple of the 17th Century, a gopura for Kali. This argument has no basis whatsoever. 

(d) above: The temple vimana has a small lion which is also used as an emblem for Sakti. The lion symbol however is not exclusively used only as a Sakti symbol. Both the Vaikhanasa and Pancharatra agamas which govern a Vaishnava temple, clearly lay down that either a lion or a garuda may be placed on the corners. The Bhrigu Samhita (Vimana Devata) makes this clear. 

The Agamic rules require that not only on the top of the Vimana, but also on the top of the mandapas either a lion or the garuda should be placed. Normally a lion is selected to overcome the enemies of the area, when the location of the temple is such where recurrent invasions are expected; if a temple is situated in a secluded and remote corner, then garuda is used for mainly spiritual and cultural ends. 

It is known to us from the epigraphs of the temple that the vimana as it stands at present was built by Vira Narasinga Yadavaraya of the 13th Century A.D. The silpis of that king had the option to choose either a lion or a garuda. They had apparently chosen the lion, as the patron king being Viranarasingaraya, had the name of the lion in his own name. 

Even if Ganesa and Durga had been placed somewhere they would not go against the agamic rules of a Vaishnava temple, since in our temple complexes all the Gods are recognised as parivara devatas. Hence the presence or absence of one particular God or emblem here and there, is in no way a pointer to the type of the idol. 

(e) above: The “Ulchattu” is no doubt very long. Here again a careful study of the epigraphs reveals that the 'Ulchattu' is of very recent origin only. It is long on account of the number of heavy ornaments and ayudhas with which the idol is decorated. The idol is an object of reverent and devout worship and the utmost care is to be taken to see that the ornaments do not scratch the idol. Thick padding cloth is required for this, and a long Ulchattu is therefore needed to serve only this utilitarian end. It has nothing to do with the idol being that of the Lord or the Lord's consort. If one could extend this argument, one could also say that a ten cubit dhoti, which is worn by a man on an auspicious occasion, is proof that a man is a woman! 

(f) above: Here again a careful study and perusal of the epigraphs of the temple would prove that the sandal has been included only from the 15th Century A.D. from the Vijayanagara period. Before that date it is absent. Perfumed sandal paste adorns Sridevi on the chest by night and the two billas are also placed at the feet of the Dhruva bera. Vishnu is traditionally called in Hindu pantheon as alankara priya as Siva is abhisheka priya, and the gandha or the sandal smell is sacred to Lord. Sandal paste can be offered to men and women as an auspicious mark and there is nothing feminine about it. 

(g) above: Factually ́turmeric bath is not given to Lord Srinivasa on Fridays. Saffron paste is added to the water. For the Snapana Tirumanjanam of all Vishnu Murtis, turmeric is one of the ingredients. This is nothing particular to this temple. Neither vada or payasam is offered to the deity after the bath. Poli is offered during the second bell. Even this custom is of recent origin and has no antiquity behind it. 

(h) above: The Devi Bhagavatam describes the Lord as Sri Venkatesvari as every god has a Sakthi aspect. It has no other significance. 

(i) above: It is seen from the agamas that there is always need for a smaller idol viz., the Bhogamurthy other than the Dhruva bera since in the Dhruva bera paryanka asana or abhisheka etc., are impracticable. 

The Friday abhishekam appears to be an ancient custom as is seen from the epigraphs. The Bhogamurti is generally installed in temples so that the abhishekam could be performed to it instead of the Dhruva bera. It is possible that when the Bhoga Srinivasa or the Manvalapperumal was consecrated here the abhishekam for the Dhruva bera was performed since it was a historic occasion in the history of the temple. As it happened to be a Friday, on all subsequent Fridays, a custom has been established by which the Dhruvamurti is given a ceremonial abhishekam. This practice of Friday abhishekam therefore quite consistent that the idol of the Lord being that of Vishnu and seems to be connected with the nityarchana vidhi necessitated at the time of the installation of the Bhoga Srinivasamurthy, in the 9th Century A.D. 

(j) above: Thomala seva is derived as a corrupt form from the Tamil word 'Thodutta malai' which means flowers that have been put together into a garland. This type of the decoration of Dhruva bera is customary in the temple and the expression Thomala seva is intended only to call the pilgrims' special attention to the flower decoration which takes place at the end of the puja. Garlands in the temple are made in several pieces, each piece being of a particular size so that the decoration could be done without waste of time, and in a grand manner. The term bhagavati aradhana of which there does not seem to be any authority, even if it exists could only be a corrupt form for bhagavad aradhana which clearly means the worship of the Lord only. 

(k) above: It has already been mentioned that the idol is Swayambhu or a self-manifested one. The Lord here combines within himself all the aspects of all deities. Hence not only Srisukta is recited but also Purusha-sukta and also three other suktas. 

The fact that the Srisukta figures as one of the five suktas recited during abhisheka, of which the purusha sukta is the first, is therefore no proof to suppose that the idol was at any time that of Sakti. 

It is thus clear that the idol of the Lord could never have been at any time conceived as the representation of the Goddess. 

Conversely it can be stated that all the characteristic features of a Sakti idol viz., full breasts, etc., and other peculiarities common to an idol of the Goddess are totally absent in this. There can therefore be no doubt whatsoever that the idol could never have been worshipped at any time as that of Sakti. 

(c) An examination whether the idol can be of Subramanya. 

It is also suggested that the temple could be that of Subramanya mainly for the reason that the 'pushkarini' is being called as 'swami pushkarini ' and swami is an abbreviation for Kumaraswami. 

This is really no argument since the term 'swami' need not necessarily apply only to Kumaraswami which is the name of the Lord Subramanya. The term 'swami pushkarini' can also be interpreted as the swami of all pushkarinis f.e., the best of all the holy tirthas. Also the tirthas associated with Kumaraswami are never known as ‘pushkarini,' but only as Kumaradara. We have the authority of the Varaha purana which states that the 'Swami Pushkarini' is a tank which Vishnu brought down to earth from Vaikunta. Moreover, all the puranas state that Skanda came to worship Vishnu at Tirumala and it is inconceivable that a God that came to worship could be deified as the presiding god. Moreover the Lord's image has only four arms and one face whereas Skanda normally has six faces and twelve hands. This identification is totally not correct. 

From the detailed examination of all the above points it can be seen that the idol is and has been all along a Vaishnava idol only, 

Before the 8th Century A.D., we have the literary evidence of the mystic outpourings of the Alvars. All these sayings of the Alvars invariably refer to Vishnu alone and there are many instances and quotations in the alvars' compositions where it could be conclusively established that throughout the ages the idol has been recognised as that of Lord Vishnu. 

It must be made clear here that the external manifestation of the Lord at Tirumala is only that of Lord Vishnu, but He being a sarvabhutantaratma, can be worshipped and is being worshipped as Siva by Saivites, as Skanda by those who worship Subramanyaswami, as Divine Mother by those who worship Devi or Sakti. The Lord of Tirumala is not a mere sectarian God, though the outward form is undoubtedly that of Lord Vishnu only. He is Vishnu, Siva, Rudra, Brahma, Maheswari, Mahakali Mahalkshmi, Mahasaraswati,Skanda, or any other form to any devotee who conceives of the Lord in that aspect. All the upacharas or the services rendered to this idol are in effect rendered to the eternal Lord. This is the real secret of the Lord of Seven Hills.
