Tradition of a self-manifested idol: 

The Dhruvabera of Lord Venkatesvara and the complementary bronzes, with the Utsava murtis of Sri Rama and Sri Krishna make up the pantheon of Tirumala. Tradition has it that the Dhruvabera of Lord Venkatesvara was not wrought by the hand of man and that the supreme Lord manifested himself in a form which could easily be comprehended by human beings. Thus we have Nammalvar's assurances that param has come down to Tirumala from his Divya Loka out of his own choice for our spiritual benefit. All the earlier alvars have also stated that the devas headed by Brahma daily worship Sri Venkatesvara on this hill as we do even now. Sri Ramanuja the great Vaishnava teacher in his mangalasloka of his great work “Sribhashya " lays stress on the great solace of the Lord for the salvation of mankind, and equals Brahma with Srinivasa. Hence traditional belief is that, Sri Venkatesvara is the self-manifested Brahman who came to Tirumala for our salvation.
