The type of idol of Lord Venkatesvara as per Vaikhanasá agama: 

The idol of Lord Venkatesvara at Tirumala is clearly seen to be a standing one which makes it fall only under the sthanaka type. Hence a sthanaka image, according to the agamas, can be of the Yoga, Bhoga, Vira or Abhicharika type, each of which would have three sub-types namely Uttama, Madhyama and Adhama murtis. Hence the image of the Lord of Tirumala could fall only under one of the above twelve divisions. 

The details of an image of any of the above twelve types mentioned according to the Marichasamhita are detailed here in a tabular form.

With the above details we can now try to pinpoint the type of the image of the Lord according to the Agamic rules. 

Since the Lord is situated on a hill and in a forest where there was no village or fortresses in the earliest days, it should be either a Yoga Adhama sthanaka or Abhicharika sthanaka or Vira Adhama sthanaka murti. It is not likely to have been a Bhoga murti in those days. Since the temple has only one murti, it is an Adhama type. 

The Yoga Adhama sthanaka type should have four hands with the two upper hands having the Chakra and Sankha, right lower hand in Abhaya while the left lower hand should be in the Katyavalambita posture. The presence of Sri Devi on the chest is not mentioned in the Agamas. In the idol of the Lord Sri Devi is carved on the right breast as an integral part of the image and not one subsequently invested as a detachable addition. As against this rule the lower right hand of the idol of the Lord is in the Varda Hastha and not in Abhaya Hastha while the Sankha and Chakra on the two upper arms are detachable and are not integral with the image. The image is therefore,  according to the agamic rules, not a Yoga Adhama sthanaka murti. 

An Abhicharika sthanaka murti , whether Uttama, Madhyama or Adhama, might have two or four hands but without any of the divine weapons. The posture of the hands whether Abhaya, Varada or Katyavalambita, is not laid down in the Agamas. Hence the image of the Lord could be of the Abhicharika sthanaka type but for certain other disabilities. The Abhicharika murti should have a shrunken chin, lean angas, that is, the hands, legs and body are to be shown as lean and it should also have upturned eyes exhibiting *thamoguna*. The idol of the Lord at Tirumala is however an extremely lovely figure, having well formed and well proportioned angas and with all the divine ornaments associated with the description of paravasudeva and with Sri Devi, the eternal mother as an integral part of the image. The image is therefore obviously not an Abhicharika sthanaka, whether of the Uttama, Madhyama or Adhama sub-divisions. 

The Vira type of image should have a Sankha and Chakra permanently and Sri Devi is not mentioned as part of the idol. Though the posture in the lower arms namely Varada or Abhaya is not specified, the presence of Sri Devi and Sankha and Chakra not being an integral part of the image, rule out this possibility also. As regards the Bhoga type of image, here also the Sankha and Chakra should be permanent and Sri Devi and Bhu Devi should both be permanently on the breast. The other hand should also be in the Katyavalambita simhakarana posture which is not seen in the image of the Lord. The only ingredient specified in this type of the image is the Varada hastha position of the right lower arm. 

Except that the Lord is Shyama or dark in colour and has four arms of which two are with detachable weapons, the application of the agamic rules establishes that the idol of Sri Venkatesvara does not fall under any of the types which the Agamas prescribe for installing a Dhruva murti. 

It only remains now to examine whether the Lord conforms to the type of the Parabrahma or Para Vasudeva. 

Different Samhitas describe Him differently in His Divyaloka. A short one given in Bhrigu Samhita (33rd Adhyaya) shows that He has four hands, is invested with the five weapons or ayudhas; the two halves of His body are symmetrical and beautifully shaped; that he wears all the divya abharanas (jewellery); that Sri Devi ever abides in His Form and that He is full of all the Kalyana gunas and wanting in none, and that He shines with His six gunas (Shadguna). This description is not a detailed one. The weapons (divya ayudhas) are not in Sri Venkateswara's hands. The mention of the Shadgunas is worth noting. The Pancharatra Agamas describe Para Vasudeva in different terms, mostly as being seated on Ananta, the Divine Serpent. They are all out of place for a consideration of the problem here. 

In the seventh chapter, sixth amsa of Vishnupurana there is a description given of the Murta Rupa of Vishnu for purposes of meditation. Four stages of meditation are mentioned. In the lowest the Murti is meditated upon as having all the weapons, all the bhushanas (ornaments) and with eight or four hands. In the next higher stage the meditation is upon the Murti, dropping out the divine weapons; in the next higher even the bhushanas or ornaments are also left out. In the next higher only the principal angas such as body, two hands etc., are presumed to be seen. This description states that the Murti has a Prasanna (spotless and brilliant) face, beautiful eyes shaped like the petal of the lotus flower, beautiful temples, broad fore-head, Kundalas (ear ornaments hanging down the even earlobes), the kantham (or neck) shaped like the right-handed Sankham (Chank), broad chest with Sri Devi seated on the Srivatsa marks, Udara (or belly) in three folds as it were, a deep seated navel, long hands eight or four in number, well knit and symmetrically shaped thighs, spotless pitambara clothing with ornaments such as Kiritam (crown), Haram (necklace) Keyuram (shoulder ornaments), Katakam etc., rings on the fingers and toes. The ayudhams (weapons 'in his hands) are Sarngam (bow), Sankham (conch), Gada (mace), Khadgam (sword), Chakram (disc). Akshamala (garland of beads) is in the sixth hand; of the remaining two hands one is in the Abhaya posture and the other in Varada posture. When only four hands are meditated upon Sankham, Chakram, Gada and the lotus flower adorn them. The above description in full is of the form for the lowest stage of meditation. This description does not apply to the form of Sri Venkatesvara. In the next higher stage all the weapons are left out and the four hands would therefore be free. All the bhushanamas or ornaments however remain on the Murti. This description would apply to the Murti form of Sri Venkatesvara in a general way. The lower hands have however a definite posture, the right Varada and the left Katyavalambita and corresponds to a Murti for meditation in the second stage. The idol of the Lord at Tirumala does not correspond to these rules also. 

From a detailed examination of the agamic rules, one can therefore only come to any of the two following conclusions. 


    (a) The idol of the Lord at Tirumala was conceived and executed at a time before the Agamas were codified and came into being, or 


    (b) The image is a class by itself and from the earliest days, has been so conceived and made by the sculptor, as to drive home the point that the Lord is self-manifest or Swayambhu.
