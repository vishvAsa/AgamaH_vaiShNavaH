DETAILS OF DAILY RITUALS IN TIRUMALA TEMPLE


## I. Introduction. 

THE dominant Hindu ritualistic thinking is that an idol of God is really only a limited expression of the one inexpressible Supreme Brahman. The *Purusha Sukta* declares that God has a thousand heads (Sahasra Sirsha Purusha). There is therefore no limit to the many different varieties or forms used to represent different aspects of that Higher Infinite which is ultimately formless. It is to focus, concentrate and lead the devotee's mind, by slow stages to the realisation of the infinite, that, in many sanctuaries and temples, worship and prayers are done, through well laid down principles of puja. Puja and temple worship act as powerful spiritual forces to raise a limited individual slowly to the realisation of the Godhead that is in him. 

Lord Krishna classifies those who came to him into four main divisions:---- 

(i) those in distress; 

(ii) those desirous of worldly gains; 

(iii) those seeking spiritual knowledge and understanding; and 

(iv) those who have already attained a high degree of spiritual wisdom 

Each of these categories also come to Sri Venkatesvara, the Lord of Seven Hills. His task is to give each what each asks for. The Lord's blessings are poured out on all men equally, but anyone could only receive according to his evolution and according to his position on the ladder of spiritual attainment. The rays of the glory of the Lord fall equally on all who are directly in its way. But if someone is behind an obstacle or in a room he will receive only a part of the illumination. 

Puja or daily worship if done according to the prescribed agamic rules is conducive to cultivating a higher spiritual yearning, which is like coming out from the confinement of the room into the glory of the sun's full rays. The Lord considers all as worthy of His help. He sheds his blessings on all, but it is the devotees' own limitations that condition what he receives. If his present need is for bodily health or material prosperity, that is what he gets. Those in the higher grades who are open to the Lord's full illumination get what they aspire for. Though they are fewer in numbers than the others, still such persons do exist. When one comes into contact with them one meets them with great joy and with a rare feeling of upliftment. It is for this gradual evolution from our material and earthly needs, through spiritual satisfaction, to a state of utter needlessness, when we can just bask in the glory of the Lord, for its own sake, that the agamic disciplines of puja and puja- vidhana are laid down. 


## II. The agama aspects of worship. 

The worship in Tirumala temple is done strictly according to the Vaikhanasa agama. According to the Bhavisthyottara purana, Vaikhanasa Rishi is said to have admired the playful lilas of Lord Krishna in Dwapara Yuga and did Tapascharya to obtain darshan of Lord Krishna. The legend goes that Lord Krishna appeared before him and instructed him to worship the Lord as Srinivasa who manifested himself in a hill on Venkatachala and that one Rangadasa will help him to locate and worship the Lord. Vaikhanasa Rishi then proceeded to Tirumala and is said to have found the Lord with the help of Rangadasa and worshipped him. Thus Vaikhanasa Rishi, according to the legend, is the first person to worship the Lord at Tirumala. Hence in the temple to this day, worship is conducted according to the Vaikhanasa agama. 

The Vaikhanasa agama recommends puja six times a day at the following times namely:- 


        (i) Pratyusha (arunodaya). 


        (ii) Prabhata (pratahkala). 


        (iii) Madhyanna (noon). 


        (iv) Aparanha (afternoon). 


        (v) Sayankala (evening sandhi time); and 


        (vi) Nisi (ardhayama or midnight). 

There is no evidence that puja six times a day as prescribed above was ever done in Tirumala. Kulasekhara Alvar in Tirumoli 1-7 states that worship six times a day was carried on in Sriranga, but there is no such mention about Tirumala. At present except during the month of Margasira no puja is performed in the temple before day break; nor is puja done early in the morning soon after sunrise. The madhyanna puja roughly corresponds to the present thomalaseva and the archana when the first bell is rung. The aparanha puja roughly corresponds to the second archana and the second bell in the temple. Even this is done only in an abridged manner. The Sayankala puja is strictly a private function for the archakas etc., and the Nisi puja is said to correspond to the ekantaseva which is really no prescribed puja at all. 

We can infer from the epigraphical records of the temple that though the Vaikhanasa form of worship has been in vogue from ancient times, there was no strict observance of the Shadkala puja here. For example the early inscriptions of the Samavai, the Pallava Queen in 966 A.D. where she had consecrated the silver idol of Bhoga Srinivasa mentions only an offering of four nalis of food per day. This quantity of food would perhaps be sufficient for only one puja when the food would have been cooked as Havis and offered to the Lord. We have no evidence of the epigraphs for the performance ever of the Shadkala puja. There is one epigraph of 1434 A.D. of Tirukkalindridasan where an arunodayakala puja was instituted by him, but this was also limited strictly to the period of Dakshinayana kala. Thus both from epigraphical records and from present practice, it would appear that though the temple has been following the Vaikhanasa agama rituals of worship, strictly speaking the Shadkala puja which is an essential aspect of Vaikhanasa agama has not been followed here. 

The Vaikhanasa agama says that the Shadkala puja is intended for the material welfare of the devotees. The Ushakalapuja promotes the increase of one's progeny and also of the cattle; Prathakalapuja leads to intensified japa and homa; the Madhyannapuja increases prosperity and promotes the enlargement of the kingdom; the Aparanhapuja brings about the destruction of evil doers; the Sayankalapuja leads to greater and increased agricultural production; and the Nisipuja increases the cattle wealth of the country. 

The agamas themselves seem to have realised that strict adherence to the shadkala puja may not be possible or practicable for various reasons, and have prescribed that either shadkala puja or trikalapuja or dvikala puja or ekakalapuja should be performed to the Lord, 

The Pancharatra agama liberalises this further than the Vaikhanasa agama and gives discretion to the temple to perform one, two, three, four, five, six or even twelve pujas according to the finances and the organising ability of the devotees. 

In Tirumala at present there are only really three pujas, the one in the morning in conjunction with what is known as thomalaseva which is open to the public, another abridged puja in the afternoon, and the third puja at night which is strictly a private one in which the archakas, the paricharakas and the acharya purushas of the temple only take part. 

The routine puja in the Tirumala temple is no doubt laid down according to the tenets of the Vaikhanasa agama, but there are some small deviations which were necessitated due to exigencies of circumstances. Strictly speaking the Vaikhanasa orthodox ritual prescribes that there is no room for puja for one who is not born in the Vaikhanasa agama and if practical considerations made necessary the participation of anyone else, he is called a devalaka. In the Tirumala temple the paricharaka is a sanyasi and the mantrapushpa is performed by the acharya purusha. Strictly speaking therefore these could not be considered to be born in the Vaikhanasa doctrine, but as devotees of the Lord they do participate in the puja. 


## III. Details of the routine daily puja and their times. 

(N.B. The following description is the practice followed in the temple till a couple of years or so ago. From 1-3-79 the T. T. D. have changed the hours of the sevas so that they may all be finished before 6 A. M. to enable devotees to have free darshan uninterruptedly from 6 A. M. to midnight. The rates for the arjita sevas are also changed.) 

(i) 4 a.m. to 4-30 a.m. (altered to 3 a. m. to 3-30 a. m, from 1-3-79 only in summer). Suprabhatham:— 

During this time the *Suprabhatam, stotram, prapatti,* and '*mangalasasana*' are recited. A descendant of Tallapakam Annamacharya sings a few of the Sankirtanas. 

Sri Venkateswara Suprabhatam consists of four items viz., 

(a) *Suprabhatam *(waking the Lord from the sleep) consisting of twenty nine slokas, 

(b) *Stotra *(hymns to the Lord) consisting of eleven slokas, 

(c) *Prapatti *(surrender to the Lord) consisting of sixteen stanzas and 

(d) *Mangalasasana *(a prayer of the Lord's glory) consisting of fourteen stanzas, thus making altogether a total seventy slokas. 

In the *Suprabhatam *the first verse is addressed to Sri Rama son of Kausalya, the second to Govinda and Kamalapati, the third and fourth to Sri Lakshmi and the next 24 slokas to Lord Venkatesa, praised variously as Venkatachalapati, Seshachalapati Srinivasa, Seshadrivibhu etc., etc. The last and the 29th stanza exhorts the devotee to aspire to 'paramartha' and 'moksha.' 

In the *Stotra *the devotee earnestly addresses the Lord surrendering his all to Him and entreats His protection. The tenth sloka is a beautiful one where the devotee submits that having come from a long distance to worship at the Lord's feet he might be blessed by the Lord even though his visits are infrequent due to his own limitations, and that he might receive the Lord's blessings in full. 

In the *Prapatti *or surrender, the first sloka is a prayerful adoration to Sri Lakshmi, the Supreme Mother who showers her grace on account of her eternal vastalya and entreats her as Bhagavati. The next 15 verses are in exquisite words and phrases of unparalleled grandeur and simplicity, where the devotee, with the complete annihilation of his ego, surrenders himself and his all, at the feet of the Lord. It would appear that the initial invocation to Sri Lakshmi is to invoke the supreme Mother's intervention before surrender to the Lord, as a child moves for the favour of the father through the mother, This idea is also contained in the 16th and the last stanza of the Prapatti. 

The other verses of the *Prapatti *seek the glory of the holy feet of the Lord which have been declared by the Rig veda as the most exalted state of attain- ment, and which the Lord himself in the Dhruva Bera seems to point out by his hand even as Parthasarathi did to Arjuna. 

In the *Mangalasasana *there is a moving verse viz., verse 9, where the Lord is supposed to indicate his own feet with his own hand as the sole refuge of all human beings. The devotee is enjoined to hope to be present at the behest of the Lord for all times, and to lose his limited soul in the eternal grace of the Lord. In fact this is the general experience of many a devotee who comes with devotion and utter surrender to the Lord. So tremendous is the divine charm of the beauty of the prasanna mangala murti of the Lord and His Excellence, that one forgets one's ego in the presence of the Lord. 

The Suprabhatam is sung before the Bangaru Vakili after which the Bhoga Srinivasamurthy who was laid to bed in the Sayana mantapa is shifted again to the Garbha griha. Navanitha harati is offered to the Lord and a mixture of cow's milk, butter and sugar is offered to the Lord. The mixture of milk, butter and sugar is then given as prasadam to the devotees who have come for Sarvadarsanam of the Lord. 

The composer of the Suprabhatam is supposed to be the Prativadibhayan- karam Annan who 's said to have flourished during the closing years of Sri Vedantadesika. 

Epigraphs do not give us any evidence as to how the morning was welcomed in the temple before the 15th Century. There is an epigraph of 1430 A.D. in which Sri Devaraya Maharaya made arrangements for the recitation of the Vedas; similarly there is no evidence to show that Tallapaka Prabandham was recited in the temple before 1476 A. D. The tamil prabhandham tirupallieluchchi, which corresponds to the Sanskrit Suprabhatam is not now sung during the Suprabhatam, but later at the commencement of the thomala- seva only. Epigraphs disclose that 1434 A.D. was the first year when an Arunodaya Sandhi offering was made to the Lord. 

At present it can only be surmised that before the beginning of the 15th Century, the morning ritual of the temple was only one of silent prayer. 

(ii) 4-30 a.m. to 5-30 a.m. 

Visvarupa Sarva Darsanam, (altered to 3-30 am. to 4-30 a.m. from 1-3-79 in summer). 

The Suprabhatam is followed by Visvarupa Sarva Darshanam when all pilgrims waiting outside the temple are allowed to have free Darshan of the Lord. From 1-3-79 this is made an arjita or paid darshan, for those who purchase special darshan tickets of Rs. 25/- each. 

There is a tradition in the temple that Brahma conducts worship every day to Lord Vishnu since the Lord self manifested himself there on the Hill and Brahma along with the Devas is said to have been doing puja there by every night for the spiritual benefit of all. Till today before the doors of the Garbha griha are finally closed, five gold cups (called vattils) of full and cleaned water with the spices required for puja as per agamas added to them, and with the other puja articles, are left at the feet of the Lord. Brahma is supposed to come and do the puja here at night. 

The tirtham left in the vessels overnight are distributed to the devotees as prasadam. This is said to be the tirtham of the puja performed by Brahma and other devas at night. This Seva is called Sarva Darshanam to show that 

this is free for all on all days except on Friday morning. 

(iii) 5-30 a.m. to 6 a.m. Suddhi. (altered to 4-30 a.m. to 5 a.m. from 1-3-79 in summer). 

After Visvarupa Darsanam is finished the screen is placed in position at the Bangaru Vakili and suddhi is done in the sanctum sanctorum when all the previous flower decoration of the Dhruva Murti are removed and the vessels required for the puja are also cleaned. All the flowers except those which are required to adorn Vishvaksena as per agamic rules are thrown into a well so that they cannot be used by any other human being. Technically this is known as Nirmalaya Sodhana. Flowers are now thrown into the well constructed by Rangadasa in the Sampangi Pradakshinam. 

In the meantime water for the puja comes from the Akasa ganga water falls, the right to bring which rests with the family of one Tirumala Nambi; the pradhana acharya purusha of the Tirumala temple. It is this akasa ganga water that is used for the forenoon puja, the evening puja and this water is also used for the Brahma aradhana after the temple gates are closed for the night. The Vaikhanasa Samhita lays down that the puja water should be brought on the back of an elephant to dance and music. The Marichi samhita does not mention this. In the Tirumala temple at present water is brought in procession only on the days of the Brahmotsavam and even then water which is so brought is not used for the puja, but only what is brought on the head of a devotee to the temple. 

(iv) 6 a.m. to 7 a.m. Thomala Seva (Arjitam). (altered to 5 a.m. to 6 a.m. from 1-3-79 in summer). 

Arjitam means darshan or seva to the Lord on a payment of a fee to the temple. In this seva are included presence during the bath to the Bhogamurti, worship and decoration of the Lord with flower garlands through recitation of the prabhandam. Admission to this seva is by payment of a fee of Rs. 200/- i.e. the fee for amantranotsavam. 

The word 'Thomala' apparently is a contraction for the Tamil word 'Thoduttamalai,' which means a garland of strung flowers. The flower garlands are made in several pieces so as to facilitate the decoration being done in a spectacular manner. 

During the Thomalaseva water is offered to the Lord for his daily needs. Abhishekam is done to the gold covers which adorn the Mula vigraham as well as to Bhoga Srinivasa. The abhiseka is accompanied by the chantings of hymns. The Lord is then decorated with beautiful large strung flower garlands from which the name of Tomalaseva is derived. 

The nityarchana then begins with the akasa ganga water being consecrated ritually and with some prescribed herbs and other articles mixed with it. The puja or archana is then done in the following manner to the Lord. 

(a) Mantrasan 

During this the Lord is offered water for arghya, padya and achamana. 

(b) Snanasana: Sinoe abhishekam everyday to Dhruva Beram is not pos- sible, it is done only to the Kautuka Beram. The gold kavacham of the holy feet of the Dhruva murti are removed in a separate set and the abhishekam is also done to them daily. A large number of saligra- mams also is given abhishekam. The Bhoga Srinivasamurti or Kautuka Beram is detached from his jivasthana and placed in a special abhishekam seat called snapana pitham. A light clothing is provided and the abhishekam according to the rituals is done, accompanied by vedic hymns. Oil is also applied and then removed by tamarind paste and water. Then abhishekam is again done with gokshira, chandana, haridrodaka, each abhishekam, being followed immediately by a suddhodaka snana. Finally a gandhodaka snana is given and the abhisehkam is closed with suddhodaka snana again. The Kautuka Beram is then dried with cloth, pushpanjali is done, and then it is restored to his Jivastana. After prokshana to the Dhruva Beram the golden link between the two is restored and pushpanyasa is done to the main Lord. All this is done between the chanting of the proper mantras. 

(c) Pushpanyasa: This is offering of flower worship to the Devas in the first, second and third avarana starting from the purusha in the east. This is done to the three avarana devas, and then for Markan- deya, Brahma and Siva. Then the offer is to be done to the Dwara- devas, Dwarapalas, Vimanapalas etc. The door step of the Garbha-

WORSHIP AT TIRUMALA TEMPLE 

griha is then cleaned with water and archana is done. At present this does not appear to be done in Tirumala. 

The agamic rule is that the nyasa for an absent deva should be deposited at the feet of the Lord. In Tirumala temple since there is no other idol represented in the Garbha Griha all the flowers are deposited at the feet of the Lord only. Since all the flowers to all the devatas is laid upon the feet of the Lord, tulasi which is laid along with others is not offered as prasadams to the devotees. 

(d) Alankarasana: In this, asana, vastra, bhushana and uttariya are put on. Then the urdhva pundra mark is applied with refined camphor and the Yagnopavita, the sacred thread is next put on. The practice of using camphor and musk for these seems to have commenced only from about 1465 A.D. as seen from the epigraphs. 

(v) 7-00 a.m. to 7-30 a.m. Koluvu (altered to 6 a.m. to 6-30 a.m. from 1-3-79 in summer) 

During this Koluvu or Darbar the idol of Koluvu Srinivasamurthy is brought out and is seated in a silverplated chair with a canopy of a gilded umbrella in the Tirumamanimantapam. This umbrella is said to be a present by the Maharaja of Mysore. Koluvu Srinivasa Murthy is then offered a mixture of fried ginger seeds and jaggery and then the income of the temple for the previous day is read out to the Lord followed by the reading of the almanac or panchangam of the previous day, the current day,and the next day. 

Normally the alankarasana itself is the darbar held in the Garbha griha, but in this temple it is done in the mukhamandapa called Tirumamanimantapa, Technically this is known as matradana where some rice, ginger, betal nuts are to be given as ration to the archakas. 

There is no reference to this function nor to Koluvu Srinivasamurthy in any of the inscriptions. It is not known since when this ritual started in the temple. 

(vi) 7.30 a.m.-8-30 a.m. Sahasranamarchana (Arjitha) (altered to 6-30 a.m. to 7-30 a.m. from 1-3-79 in summer) 

This is also an arjitha seva for which admission can be had by payment of Rs. 200/- ie fee for amantranotsava 

135 

THE TIRUMALA TEMPLE 

During the Sahasranamarchana the recital of the Lord's name is done, and general blessings are invoked in the names and the gotras of the ticket holders. There is a custom in the temple by which a lumpsum payment or an annual compounded fee is paid to enable this to be performed regu- larly. In other temples separate archanas are done for each worshipper, but in Tirumala the names are read out after a single sahasranamarchana is done. 

The Sahasranamarchana here is Sri Venkateswara Sahasranamarchana and can be appropriate only to the Tirumala temple while the usual Vishnu Sahasranama common to all vaishnava temples is more commonly known. There is one inscription of 1518 A.D. which first mentions this Sahasranamar- chana. 

Sri Virapratapa-Virɛ Achyutaraya once performed this archana personally asking the archakas to read out the names of the Lord. 

(vi) 8-30 a.m. to 9-00 a.m. Naivedya or the First Bell. (altered to 7-30 a.m. to 8 a.m. from 1-3-79 in summer). 

(a) Naivedya. 

The first bell announces the offering of food as naivedya to the Lord by ringing the two big bells followed by Sattumurai through the recitation of the prabandham by the Jiyangar or his assistants and the Vaishnava Acharya- purushas. This is followed by the distribution of matras or dadhyodana among them. 

The ringing of the bells and the naivedyam is popularly called the first bell of the temple. While the food is offered as naivedya to the Lord only the archakas are present and the Bangaru Vakili doors are closed. During this time the cooked food is brought in the mantapa in large gangalams of exact sizes, called solai or half solai measures. Food offerings are also made to Vishvaksena, Garuda and the nityasuries during this time. 

An attempt was made in recent years to introduce madhuparkam, but local sentiment was so high that this was soon given up. 

Though according to the agamic rules a homa is performed after the naivedya three times a day or atleast in connection with the morning puja, it is not being performed in the Tirumala temple.

(6) Yatrasana. 

For offering bali to all the 'devatas in the prakaram of the temple, the Baliberam or Koluvu Srinivasa should be taken out to the accompaniment of music, chants etc. In Tirumala however, such a function does not appear to have been conducted. The archaka and the paricharaka in this temple go round the vimana pradakshinam and offer Bali to Vishvaksena, Garuda, Dwaja and Yudadhipa and deposit the balance of the bali in the stones placed between the Balipitam and the Dwajasthambam. 

(c) Sattumurai. 

The term 'Sattumurai' means the recitation of Tamil prabandham of the alvars in the manner prescribed. The Nalayira prabandham as prescribed is recited now when only Sri Vaishnavas are allowed to be present. The Srivaishnavas headed by the Jeer alone go into the garbha griha after the archakas return from the offering of Bali. Portions of the prabandham are read out commencing with the patrams and ending with 'Vazhi tirunamam' The tirtham, chandanam and prasadam are then distributed to all present in the order of preference. 

This custom is not mentioned in any of the inscriptions though an epigraph of 1476 A.D. mentions the Sattumurai of the alvars and not of the Lord. Even then the recital of the prabandham took place in Sri Ramanuja's shrine and not in the Garbha Griha. The Sattumurai function wherever it is performed is generally considered an exclusive right of the Sri Vaishnavas. The Tomalaseva ends with the Sattumurai. 

(viii) 9-00 a.m. to 1-00 p.m.-Sarvadarsanam. (altered to 8 a.m. to midnight from 1-3-79 with an interval of an hour at noon and an hour at night for puja). 

During this time free sarva darsanam of the Lord is allowed to all pilgrims. In recent years the rush for darsan has become so great that one can have Darsan of the Lord only for a second or two and that too only in a constantly moving queue. 

(ix) 12-00 noon to 1-00 p.m. Aparanhapuja or Second Bell. 

Naivedyam for a second time is now offered followed by a second archana with 108 names only. This is wholly a private one, and the Lord's astothara- nama from the Varahapurana is now repeated. 

137 

During this naivedyam the food offerings (cherupulu) and other catables (panyarams or pallu) paid for by the devotees are offered to the Lord. This is an arjitha seva where the prasadam is paid for, by the devotee and after some quantity is taken away for the temple, the balance is given to the grihasta or the donor. 

After the second bell is rung, the first half of the day's ritual worship of the temple is presumed to be over and the box containing the payments made by the pilgrims within the temple is brought over to the parapattidar i.e., the officer incharge of the temple treasury and the doors are closed. 

(x) 1.00 p.m. to 8.00 p.m. Sarvadarsanam 

In recent years due to heavy rush of Pilgrims, Sarvadarsanam is allowed soon after naivedyam is over. 

(xi) 8-00 p.m. to 9 p.m. Ratripuja. 

The Ratripuja is done at night to the Lord. This is similar to the morning Tomalaseva. This is strictly a private puja and none, but those who have religious duty to perform, are allowed to be present. 

Ardhajamapuja or last function for the night is known as the ardhajama or the nisi puja. This is a private one and is meant for offering sweet, payasam, etc. 

(xii) 9 p.m. to 12 midnight Fee Sarvadarshan is given again.  \
Now Suddhi is again done at the temple. 

(xiii) 12 midnight to 12-30 a.m. Ekantaseva.  \
Ekanta Seva or Pavalimpuseva. 

This is an arjita seva to which admission is given by ticket on a fee of Rs.200/-i.e. amantranotsavam. The Bhoga Srinivasa,except during the Margasira month, is laid down on the Vuyyalu hung by silver chains hanging from a beam in the mukhamantapam from which it derives its name of Sayana mantapam. This is also called Ekantaseva. At this time, milk, fruits, almond nuts etc., are offered to the Lord and a portion is distributed to the pilgrims. Two billas of perfumed chandanam are placed at the feet of the Dhruva Murti after removing the kavacham covering the feet. Half a Billa is also placed on the chest of Bhoga Srinivasa, a quarter for alarmelmangai on the chest of the Dhruva murthi. Another quarter is also left for the night puja by Brahma. 

138 

Tarikonda Venkamamba's barati in a plate inlaid with one of the Dasavatarams each day with pearls brought by a descendent of the family is waved before the Lord after offering milk and a few pieces of cashew nuts. During this function songs are also sung. The descendent of Tallapaka poets also sings sankirtanam of Tallapaka. 

This seva is done to Bhoga Srinivasamurti for 11 months in a year while in the Dhanurmasa or Margali month the idol of Sri Krishna receives it. 

It is during this seva that the silver cups filled with water are placed for worship by Brahma and half the phalam and chandanam are also kept there. 

An inscription of 1513 A.D. in the temple records, that Chinnaji Devi and Tirumala Devi, the two queens of Krishnadeva Raya presented each, a gold cup weighing 374 tukams for offering milk during this seva. Obul nayaka Ramanayaka, a general of Krishna Devaraya also presented 200 cows in 1514 A.D. for preparing paledu kulambu for the Ardhajama seva as per another epigraph. 

This is the normal routine puja in the temple every day. However variations are made on Thursdays and Fridays to correspond to the special puja peculiar to that day. 


### (xiv) Thursday Pulangiseva. 

After the mid-day puja on Thursday the Lord is dressed only in dhoti and uttariyam. The Kasturi is also removed leaving only a thin mark. In the evening after suddhi is performed the flowers are brought for decorating the murti. The body of the Lord is now dressed in an ordinary dovati. This process is called sadalimpu or sallimpu which means lossening or removing. 

After evening puja and naivedyam offering of panakam and split green- gram, a laced velvet gown is put on the Lord and the body is decorated fully with garlands of flowers extending from the crown to the feet. This decoration exclusively with flowers is called 'Pulangi seva.' This is an arjita seva, admission to which is given on payment of a fee. 

After this is over the Ekanta seva takes place at about 10-30 p.m. following the usual routine. 

It is not known from the epigraphs as to when and why this arrangement was first introduced. There is a reference in Silappadikaram, the early Tamil classic to 'puvadaiyil polindu tonriya.' The Tamil word ' Puvadai' is literally a translation of the Telugu word 'Pulangi' and hence we can ascertain that by about 8th century this Pulangi seva was in vogue. 

139 

THE TIRUMALA TEMPLE 

Perhaps the reason for this is purely a pragmatic one namely the difficulty of having to remove the clothing ornaments etc., on the Lord on Friday before the elaborate Abhishekam is done. 


### (xv) Friday Abhishekam. 

Abhishekam to the Lord is done only on Fridays. On Friday early morning after Suprabhatam chanting, while Tomalaseva and Archana are conducted privately, everything is made ready for Lord's abhishekam by powdering pachchakarpuram, mixing wetted saffron paste, pressing musk with a few drops of civet oil into a small paste by preparing chandanam, and by extracting civet oil, all of which are collected in suitable silver cups and taken in procession to the accompaniment of music round the sanctum through the Vimana pradakshanam. 

A ball-like paste of civet oil mixed with camphor is placed at the feet of the Lord. After this the Tirumanjanam abhishekam is made to the mula vigraham. This function takes about an hour or an hour and half with chanting of the mantras. The abhishekam is done to the chanting of purusha sukta, narayana sukta, sri sukta, bhu sukta, nila sukta and the prabhandams. The abhisehakam starts with suddhodakam and then alternates with milk, watered chandanam etc. The saffron water flowing down His body is collected in big silver cups. Then the body of the Lord is dried up and civet oil is lightly smeared from crown to feet. A small quantity of the refined camphor powder and the white namam in urdhva pundra with two patches is put on with a powder sprinkling on the face together with the intermediate tapering line of musk. Then abhishekam to the gold image of Sri Lakshmi hanging in a gold chain of the chest is done with chanting of Sri Suktam. At the end of this harati is done. Then the white namam is thickened and broadened; and the Lord is dressed in Pitambaram bedecked fully with valuable jewels and ornaments. 

It would appear that the custom of Friday abhishekam to the Lord started with the consecration of the Bhoga Srinivasa Murty whose abhishekam might have happened to fall on a Friday and the custom somehow continues that the Dhruva Murti gets Abhishekam on Friday. 

The use of punugu or civet was first introduced by Devaraya in 1429 A.D. as per an inscription. From an endowment of 1496 A.D. by Kandadai Appachi Anna Ayyangar we learn that punugu kappu was applied every alternate Friday. An inscription of 1506 A.D. tells us that the application of Ponugu 

140 

kappu was for the abhishekam of the Dhruva Murti only, and that Alarmel Mangai Nachchiyar was having only abhishekam. This is also the current practice. 

That the Friday abhishekam became the usual weekly routine is clear from an inscription of Krishna Deva Raya of 1517 A.D. who set apart the sunkam of 1000 varahas for Punugu kapu on every 8th day. This makes it clear that the Tirumanjanam was on a weekly Friday. 

There is an interesting inscription of 1583 A D. by one Ettur Tirumalai Kumara Tatacharya in which an endowment for abhishekam gives the following details: 

Gambhura 4 Kudira (one kudira=210 varaham weight)  \
Civet bags: 200  \
Saffron: 30 pana weight.  \
White cloth 1 (selai)  \
Kasturi and Turmeric paste did not figure in that list. 

At present the articles used for the abhishekam are:- 


        Gambhara 		3 ½  kacha seers. 


        Civet 		7 ½  bags kacha seers or 1 visas. 


        Saffron 		1 ¼  kacha seer or 36 tolas. 


        Kasturi musk 	3 kacha seers. 


        Turmeric musk 	 ¼ kacha seer. 

The first use of turmeric paste is seen from an inscription of 1465 A.D. of Kandadai Ramanuja Ayyangar. In 1583 A.D. Sri Kumara Tatachari did not provide turmeric paste perhaps the high quantity of saffron powder making up for this. 

Pachcha Karpuram or Tirumankappu is mentioned as early as 1380 A.D. where it is said to have been used in an inscription to Utsava Murti. Kasturi is also used in this. 

Tiruman kappu is put on soon after abhishekam is over. After this is done the decoration of the Dhruva murti takes place. 


### (xvi) Sripadarenu: 

A portion of the paste of the refined camphor mixed with civet oil called Sripadarenu is distributed to the hereditary persons doing service and small quantities is also given to the grihastas also.

THE TIRUMALA TEMPLE 

The practice of pressing camphor on the chin of the Lord is related to a tradition. A bhakta stated to be Anantalvar, a disciple of Ramanuja, under- took to excavate the tank, now known as alvar tank, together with his wife. He observed a young person moving only small clods of earth, and being angry, he struck at his chin. When later he went to the temple to worship, he found blood oozing from the Lord's chin, felt remorse for his needless act, brought some drug and applied it to Lord's chin. It is because of this that refined camphor is now said to be pressed to the Lord's chin after his ablution on Friday. 

Sripadarenu is well kneaded by hand by the Jiyangar and is divided according to hierarchy. A small quantity is also given to the pilgrims, called kainidi ie., what is left in the hands as prasadam. 


### (xvii) Tirumanjana Tirtham. 

The abhisheka tirtham from the body of the Lord with little refined camhpor and saffron is also distributed. Small quantities are given to pilgrims following Sarvadarshan. It is also given to grihastas along with small pieces of dried chandanam, Sripadarenu and panyarams to be taken home by them where they celebrate their pilgrimage by distributing tirtham and panyarams to their friends and relatives. 

The first water is also usually taken by the archakas and the Jeer and others. This is highly valued. Along with the Tirumanjanam Tirtham, a small quantity of sweet-meat called poli is sent down to Tirupati for distribution to the officers of the Devasthanams and others. 

On Fridays, after the sarvadarsanam, Tomalaseva and the archana in the night are performed followed by food offerings, the Ekantaseva is done. 

This closes the daily routine nityarchana in the temple.

## (xix) Mention of daily puja in the Epigraphs of Tirumala during the ages. 

A critical study of the epigraphs of the Tirumala Temple gives us information about the details of the daily routine puja that were performed in the Tirumala temple during the ages. Many of these ancient rituals have now ceased to be performed but some are continuing. A few of them are listed below:- 

(a) Nityadipam and Nityanaivedyam. 

(b) Sandhis and Food offerings. 

(c) Vedaparayanam. 

(d) Abhishekam. 

(e) Nityadipam and Nityanaivedyam. 

The Pallava inscription No. 219-G.T., dated in the 51st year of the reign of Ko-Vijaya-Dantivikramavarman, (corresponding roughly to 830 A.D.), the earliest in date in the collection, records an arrangement made for keeping a lamp burning before a processional image newly installed in the shrine of Tiruvenkatattu-Emperumanadigal. 

The Chola records register donations and gifts intended for nanda-vilakku (lamp-lighting) or for aradhanam (food-offerings). A fragmentary record (No. 232—G.T.), dated in the 29th Year of Madiraikonda Ko-Parakesari- varman alias Parantaka I, registers an arrangement made by Kodungoluran of Malai-nadu with the sabhai of Tiruchchokunur (Tiruchanur) by which the sabhai undertook to keep a lighted lamp. Another epigraph (No. 234— G.T.), dated in the 10th year of the same king's reign, registers a similar deposit for lamplighting. In the reign of Rajaraja I, one Arulakki alias Rajaraja- Muvendavelan paid 40 kalanju of gold into the temple-treasury for main- taining a lamp (Nos. 212 to 216 G.T.). The epigraph No. 20-T.T., dated in the reign of Sri Koppatrakesari-panmar alias Sri Rajendra-Choladeva, records a provision made for lamp-lighting. Besides, it gives us some interest- ing information regarding state-supervision over temples in those times. It was brought to the notice of Adhikari (royal officer) Korramangalam-udaiyan that the assembly of Tirumundiyam which undertook to light 24 lamps at Tirumala had failed in the discharge of their trust by discontinuing 22 and maintaining only 2 lights. The Adhikari enquired into the matter, became convinced of the neglect on the part of the assembly, and ordered the conti- nuance of the entire service through the managers of the temple. It is inci- dentally mentioned that all articles required for the daily food-offerings were transmitted from Tirupati every day to Tirumala, and also that the Tiru- mundiyam sabhaiyar had a certain service (Paricharakam) to render to the temple for which at the time a sum of 3 Pon was standing to their credit. 

During the 13th century we find ample provision made by devotees both for nitya-dipam (lamp-lighting) and for nitya-naivedyam (food-offerings). We also observe that, in place of the then prevailing practice of paying 40 kalanju of gold usually for a lamp, cows were presented to the temple to serve the purpose. Nos. 101, 118 and 176–T.T. and 112 and 113-G.T. belonging to the reign of Tribhuvana-chakravartigal Sri Vira-Narasimha Yadavaraya, and Nos. 73, 111 and 173-T.T. belonging to the reign of Tribhuvana-chakra- vartigal Vijaya-Gandagopaladeva, illustrates the above procedure regarding arrangements for the service of lamp-lighting through donations of gold and silver coin or through gifts of cows. 

In the Vijayanagara period, food-offerings took precedence over lamp- lighting and in certain cases presentation of cows was preferred to payment of gold, since, besides yielding ghee for the lamps, they served the additional purpose of offering the dairy products to the deities. No. 92-T.T. is a Sanskrit verse recounting in general terms the charities of Amatyasekhara Mallanna (chief minister under Devaraya I and Devaraya II of the First dynasty) in the matter of naivedyam and nitya-dipam for Sri Venkatesvara. 

No. 70-T.T. of the time of Saluva Narasimha records a gift in Saka 1390 ( 28-2-1469 A.D.) by Kandadai Ramanujayyangar, a zealous and influential Vaishnava preceptor, of 40 cows to the temple for supplying curds for preparing dadhyodanam (food mixed with curds) to be offered to Sri Venkatesvara daily. 

No. 59-T.T. is a somewhat peculiar record. Instead of the usual gift of lamps that we meet with in other inscriptions, we find here an arrangement made by Koneri and Ulagalandavelan, head-men (kartar) of Sattukudi- Marudur, a village in the sub-division of Narayanapurapparru in the Chandra- giri-rajya, by which they deputed in Saka 1384 ( 1462 A.D. ), for the merit of Saluva Narasimha, certain persons, being residents of the above village of whom four are mentioned by name, for the service of lighting lamps (tiruvilakkukkudi) in the temple of Tiruvenkatamudaiyan, and directed them to render service to the temple in perpetuity through their descendants. These persons were enjoined also to measure out two marakkals of ghee every year with the measure called Chalukya-Narayanan-kal as they used to do till then and obtain the certificate issued by the Jiyar under his signature. 


### (b) Sandhis (Food-Offerings). 

As noted already, during the Vijayanagara period, food-offerings came to be extensively provided for by the devotees in preference to lights which were observed to have been put up in the presence of the deities during the earlier centuries. This course was so universally adopted that the offerings were arranged not only for special occasions but for each day and on different occasions in the course of the day. Thus the quantity of holy food offered each time as well as the number of times it was offered to the deities increased so much that this particular duty must have entailed much labour and time and demanded the services of a large number of cooks. In addition to this large quantity of holy food offered each day, certain worshippers desired to have offered occasionally big heaps of cooked rice measuring about 200 marak- kals, styled Tiruppavadai (Nos. 54, 197 and 253-T.T. and 151—G.T.). 

The time for offering naivedyam in any quantity and variety each day at present occurs usually at the end of each of the three series of functions in the course of the worship of the deity (trikala-puja) for the day, commencing early in the morning and closing early in the night. But, in the past, it would appear that the deities were propitiated with food-offerings, on more than these three occasions, as at the beginning or end of each function during the interval forming the sandhi (juncture) between two succeeding functions. This term sandhi which occurs in the epigraphs must have originally indicated the juncture forming a short interval of time between two succeeding puja functions when offerings were made to the deities, but latterly it came to signify in the expressions, sandhi-muppadu (thirty units of cooked rice), pagal-sandhi (day-offerings), etc. In the inscriptions we meet with a number of them commencing with the udayakalam, sirukalam or arunodayakalam (the early hours of the morning) and closing with the ardhayaman (the early hours of the night), Even at the present time, in the course of the daily worship there can be observed a certain number of individual functions making up the series of ceremonial, such as the rites of waking up the deity in the morning with the chanting of hymns (suprabhatham) and offering of sugar and butter,then deco- rating Him with flowers (tomalaseva), next holding a levee or darbar (koluvu) when the temple purohita reads the panchangam (almanac) for the day and the temple-accountant presents an account of the income and expenditure of the temple, both grain and cash, of the preceding day; and then worship through invocation of the 1008 appellations of Sri Venkatesvara (Sahasranama- archana), and lastly offering of cooked, seasoned and sweetened food (maha- naivedyam), as the final rite in the series. It is thus possible to arrange for offerings for the deity either before beginning or after completing an individual rite in the series, and we infer from the several offerings provided for each day by the devotees, both high and low, that in the past this possibility was in vogue. Of these, three occasions can be definitely known, as the udaya- kalam (early hours of the morning) when the deity is offered light food, tiruvadi- vilakkina-poludu (the time when the Holy-Feet are washed) which is a special rite in the tomala-seva, or decoration with flowers, and ardhayamam (early hours of the night), while the others are not clear. 

Sitakaragandan-sandhi (No. 195-T.T.) is the earliest in the date belonging to the Vijayanagara times that we meet with, for this institution. Immadi- Rahuttarayan Singaya-Dannayakkan, a general under Tiruvenkatanatha Yadavaraya, gave to the temple, as a tiruvidaiyattam, Singana-nallur alias Pongalur in Illattu-nadu, which had been previously bestowed upon him as a sarvamanya by Tiruvenkatanatha Yadavaraya. 

Bukkarayan-sandhi is mentioned as the primary one during which, along with the tirupponakam (cooked rice mixed with green gram, ghee, etc.,) to be offered as originally stipulated, koyil-kelvi Emperumanar-jiyar, manager of Pankayachchelli-tirunandavanam at Tirumala and the head of a religious institution at Tirumala and Tirupati, arranged Saka 1367 for offering to Sri Venkatesvara two tirupponakam daily (No. 106-T.T.). And Periya- perumal-jiyar arranged likewise in Saka 1380 for two tirupponakams daily (No. 47-T.T.). No.23-T.T. which is dated in 1372 mentions Rayar-sandhi. 

Krishnaraya's provision for offerings as well as that of Achyutaraya are not explicitly recorded but they are referred to in the provision made by Varadajidevi-amman, queen of Achyutaraya, and are given precedence over the latter while being offered (No. 49-T.T.). Ramarajayyanavasaram mentioned in No. 82-T.T. probably indicates the offerings made by Aliya- Ramaraya in Saka 1470 during the reign of Sadasivaraya. 


### (c) Vedaparayanam. 

The recitation of the Vedas forms a component part of the functions connected with the temple so much so that its absence would be considered to portend evil and would therefore be viewed with dismay and alarm. Such a state existed temporarily in the life-history of the temple at Tirumala, sometime during the earlier half of the 15th century, but measures were adopted for its rehabilitation during the reign of Devaraya II of the First Vijayanagara dynasty. It is stated in his epigraph that grandeur existed in all services rendered for Sri Venkatesvara except in the case of the Vedaparayanam which service ceased to be performed for sometime and that this defect was taken to the notice of the royal officer Devanna-Udaiyar by Alagappiranar alias Tirukkalikanridasar with the request that it might be revived and continued for the merit of Deva- raya Maharayar. Twenty-four Mahajanam (learned Brahmanas) of Siddhakuttai alias Srinivasapuram were engaged for chanting the Vedas in the presence of Sri Venkatesvara. The king approved of the arrangement and was pleased to grant the half-share belonging to the Raja-Bhandaram (king's treasury) in the village of Siddhakuttai alias Srinivasapuram in Kottala-sthalam situated in Vaikunda- valanadu, as shrotriyam, for the purpose. The grant of half the village secured by Alagappiranar Tirukkalikanridasar was made over to the twenty-four Brahmanas. But these Brahmanas, feeling that this half share was insufficient to maintain them, petitioned the Sthanattar for the grant of the other half also of the village which was owned by the Sri-Bhandaram (temple-treasury), The temple authorities could not alienate their half-share, it being probably an endowment to the temple for a specific purpose, and they therefore devised a plan by which, while the temple could account for the produce from its half-share of the village and maintain the trust for whose conduct its managers were made responsible, the services of the twenty-four Brahmanas engaged for the Vedaparayanam might be firmly and permanently secured by allowing them a full living. Here again this device was effected by Tirukkalikanridasar. 

It appears that the annual yield from the village of Srinivasapuram for the share of the temple was 200 panam and, if this share of the temple in the village had to be parted with, this 200 panam had somehow to be made good. The villagers of all the full devadana villages belonging to the temple situated in the Tirukkudavur-nadu and Vaikunda-valanadu were called upon to contribute their mite so that the full sum of 200 panam could be made up. The villagers agreed to this contribution, solemnly vowing with libations of gold and water on the Utthanadvadasi day in the cyclic year Pramadicha corresponding to Saka 1355 to pay their share collectively for each village into the temple-treasury commencing from the same year, towards the conduct of the Vedaparayanam. On the strength of this agreement executed by the villagers represented by the Periyanattu-velan and the Ur-kanakku or the velan of each individual tiruvidaiyattam village, the Sthanattar of the temple were emboldened, their scruples and restraints being set at rest, to grant the half-share of the temple in the village of Srinivasapuram to the twenty-four Maha-Brahmanas reciting the Vedas and thus gain a double object. No doubt the technical flaw arising from their alienation of property endowed for maintaining the original charity was sought to be obviated through these devices, but whatever kind of compensation might have been effected, the alienation must have been a breach of trust. But perhaps it weighed lightly against the heavy pressure of the necessity and urgency for the renewal of the Vedaparayanam service in the temple. 

Prior to the execution of the above agreement by the villagers, it appears that a temporary interim device was also adopted, It was to lease out the half-share of the village on Srotriya-Kuttakai to Tirukkalikanri-dasar who on the one hand paid the lease amount into the temple-treasury and on the other permitted the Brahmanas to reap the benefit from the half village. This was only preliminary to the final stage of complete alienation and prior to obtaining the consent of the villagers. 

There are references to Vedaparayanam at a later date, i.e., during the time of the Second Vijayanagara dynasty, and we may take it that, after Saka 1355 when it was revived by Devaraya II, there has not been any break in its continuity down to this day, and that it has added, as it was expected to do, to the glory and sanctity of the temple which is stated to have enjoyed all other Vaibhogamgal. 

Besides Vedaparayanam, we meet with arrangements for the reading of Puranams also on certain sacred days. In a record of the 16th century (No. 3- G.T.) We note that on the day of kaisika-dvaðasi (ie., the 12th day of the bright half of the Telugu month of Kartikam) Ananta-vrata-puranam was read, perhaps in Sri Govindaraja's temple at Tirupati. Similarly an inscription (No. 253-T.T.), dated in Saka 1413, records an arrangement made for the reading of Tiruvenkata-mahatmyam by Pasindi Venkatatturaivanjiyar Ramanujayyan, the donor in the above record, on a day in the month of Margali. 


### (d) Abhishekam, 

A few records mention a daily Tirumanjanam or abhishekam for Sri Venkatesvara at Tirumala and for Sri Govindaraja at Tirupati. The earliest reference occurs in No. 4-T.T. dated in Saka 1386, when Kandadai Ramanujayyangar arranged, as his serive (Kainkaryam) for the Alagappiranar-tiruman- janam conducted daily for Sri Venkatesvara, for the supply of perfumery to the temple through his Ekaki (Le., unmarried) disciples of the Sattada- Srivaishnava sect. The perfumery consisted of meditta-sattuppadi or chandanam (sandal-paste), manjal-kappu (turmeric), melli-kappu (musk) and karpura-kappu or pachchakarpuram (refined camphor); and along with these a small cloth and betel-leaves and nuts were supplied by them. 

This Alagappiranar-tirumanjanam comes to notice also in No. 163-T.T. dated in Saka 1406, wherein Kandadai Ramanujayyangar is again the donor. This epigraph, besides furnishing the above information regarding the holy bath for Sri Venkatesvara daily, records a further provision for a daily bath for Sri Govindaraja at Tirupati known'as Tirumagaludanvaruvar-tirumanjanam and for food-offerings known as Sri Kulasekhara-perumal tiruvaradhanam- Camphor for waving before the deities is the additional article of supply required to be made for the two temples at the time of bath, while for Sri Govindaraja's temple was to be issued a parivattam (cloth) also. The significance of this inscription consists in the mention of the village Gundi-pundi which was granted by Saluva Narasimha for the support of the Ramanuja-kutam, and in the authorisation of the utilisation of a part of its income for the expenses of the tirumanjanam, whereas in the earlier one (No. 4-T.T.) no mention is made of the village and the articles of perfumery were only required to be supplied from the Ramanuja-kutam. 

Through the other record (No. 187-T.T.) Tirukkalikanridasar Alagap- piranar provided for the supply of meditta pulugu-kappu for the deity's face (tirumukha-mandalam) each day for six months, together with sandal-paste (meditta-sattuppadi) and camphor for waving a light (alatti or arati). 

This is the first mention we get of pulugu-kappu and here it is stated that it was arranged to be done every-day for six months. The next reference to it occurs in No. 336-T.T. dated in Saka 1418, wherein Kandadai Appach- chiyar-Anna provided on the Friday occurring once in 15 days which happened to be the day of pulugu-kappu murai for Sri Venkatesvara, for the recitation of the Ula, a species of poem, in praise of Kandadai Ramanujayyangar and for the offering of two atirasappadi for the deity at the time of anointment with pulugukappu. The expressions of the record indicate that the pulugu- kappu function had been carried on for some time past and that men had become familiarised to it by that time. 

There is a function, extant in the temple routine on Fridays, which is denominated punugukapu during which the Tirumeni, the holy body of the idol including the face, is smeared with civet-oil and then the Tiruman-kappu, the vertical white Vaishnavait mark in two thick patches, is formed with fine dust of refined camphor, together with an intermediate black one of musk. Further, in the present-day vocabulary of the temple, punugukapu includes not only the civet-oil and camphor but also musk and saffron, the former being used for putting on the middle mark Kasturi-tilakam on the forehead, and the latter for making up the sandal-paste besides being one of the articles of perfumery for the abhishekam. It is therefore probable that the two terms pulugu-kappu and punugu-kapu are mere variants and that the former com- prised of the same four articles as the latter now does, namely punugu (civet) pachcha-karpuram (refined camphor), kasturi (musk) and kumkumapuvvu or kesari (saffron).
