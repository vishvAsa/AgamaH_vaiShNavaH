Among the common *Lacertilia *(Lizards) mention may be made of the  Monitor lizard (*Varanus griseus*: Telugu-Udumu). Geckos(*Hemidactylus frenatus*-Telugu-Nalkisi) and wall-lizards as well as the common garden  lizard (*Calotes versicolor* : Telugu-Tondaki) are the usual sights.  

Among the tortoises, mention may be made of the soft shelled tortoise and the common tortoise which occur not only in rivers and streams but  also in numerous wells and ponds. The starred Tortoise (*Testudo elegans*)  is also found in the tract. It is a land-dweller and seeks the shelter of rocks  where on account of its pattern it blends well with the bouldery surface.  

A variety of fish are also found in the several rivers, streams, reservoirs  and tanks in the district.
