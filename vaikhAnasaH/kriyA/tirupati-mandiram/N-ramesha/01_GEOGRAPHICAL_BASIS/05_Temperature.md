The annual temperature ranges from 18° to 42° C. The period from about  the middle of November to the middle of February is the coolest part of the  year. In December when the mean temperature is the lowest, the mean  daily maximum temperature is 25.3°C (77.5°F) and the mean daily minimum  is 15.4°C (59.7°F). After February the temperature begins to rise rapidly.  April and May are the hottest months with a mean daily maximum  temperature of 34.5°C (94.6°F). The nights are slightly hotter in May than  in April, the mean daily minimum in May being 23.9°C (75.0°F). Thunder  showers which occur on some days during the afternoon of April and May  bring welcome relief. With the onset of the SouthWest monsoon by about  the first week of June, day temperature decreases a little and the weather  in the whole of the south west and post monsoon season is more agreeable  than in the summer season. Night temperature decreases after October.
