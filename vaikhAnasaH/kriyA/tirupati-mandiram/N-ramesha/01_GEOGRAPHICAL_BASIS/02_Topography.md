The physical geography of Tirumala, like its social economy, typifies  the interaction of the Tamil and Telugu cultures of South India. The dominant  topographical feature of Tirumala is the secluded hill top on which the temple  is built. As a matter of fact this has been referred to in the following words  used in Silappadhikaram:  

" Venkadamennum Enguyar Malaiyath thuchimimisai"  

This notion that the Lord was named as " Uchchiyilninran" (He who  stands on the summit) appears to have persisted as a legacy of the tradition  till the middle of the 13th Century. The realisation that the temple was  actually on a much lower level than its surroundings became more general  in later days.  

The temple rises to 3,426 feet. A little further near the Jabali Tirtham  the level is 3177 feet. To the East the hill rises from about 2250 ft. to 2750 ft.;  to the South to 2920 ft. and in the South west the Narayanagiri rises to 3,620 ft.  

The western parts of the Chittoor district in which Tirumala is situated  form the rugged eastern scarps of the Mysore Plateau with Gneissic rocks.  Eastwards of the plateau are numerous clusters of detached hills some of  considerable size and elevation. In the eastern parts of the area, the Cuddapah  geological formations occur. The southern end of the Veligondas, the  Tirumala hills including the Mamandur valley forests, contain a succession  of shales, quartzites etc. The tremendous lines of scarp and often vertical  cliffs seen in the Seshachalam range of hills give a peculiar and grand character  to the local landscape
