Among the gneissic hills, iron ore of Dharwarian age in the form of  hematite is found in considerable quantities and is in some places, exported.  The product is poor in quality and the percentage of iron is less than 60%,  Steatite barytes, gold and lead are found in small quantities in the area. Copper  mines, once profitably worked in the Kalahasti Zamindari, have long been  abandoned.
