+++

The annual rainfall is between 34 and 35 inches. The rainfall during  the monsoon period from June to September constitutes only 44% of the  annual normal rainfall. During May there is some significant amount of  rainfall mostly in the form of thunder showers. During the post monsoon  season as much as 35 % of the annual rainfall is received. The period from  August to November is the chief rainy season, October being the rainiest  month. The variation in the rainfall from year to year is very large.  

The valleys of the tract on the whole are fairly healthy. In the Tirupati  range the climate is very unhealthy, and till recently a residence of even a  few days ensured an attack of malaria fever.  

The rainfall is rather precarious in Chittoor District where Tirumala is located and the district is constantly subject to drought and famine. Most  of the precipitation occurs in the North-East monsoon while it is less in the South-West monsoon. The western taluks of Vayalpad, Madanapalli, Punganur,  Palamaner and Kuppam are the worst taluks constantly subject to famine.  Whenever there are depressions in the Bay of Bengal nearer to Madras  coast, the district gets good rain under their influence.
