SEVEN PHASES IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE TIRUMALA TEMPLE 


## 1. Introduction. 

The word 'Tirumala' means only the holy hill. Thus any hill may be called 'Tirumala' and the temple on it could also be known as 'Tirumala Temple. But in normal practice, the most sacred of all hill temples viz., the temple of Lord Venkatesvara on the Vengadam hills is only known as Tirumala Temple. 

It is impossible to determine the date of construction of this temple. There is no direct evidence to help us in this connection, and any attempt must therefore be based wholly upon inference from circumstantial evidence. 

The architectural development of the temple can however be broadly traced from a study of the various structures and the inscriptions in the temple. A stylistic comparison of many of the architectural features of the temple would also give us some general idea about how the construction of the temple and its various structures progressed through the ages. This evidence could in many cases be supplemented and also corrected by epigraphical evidence, since many pious devotees from emperors to ordinary temple servants had made donations to keep the sacred temple in good order and these give us valuable data on contemporary conditions. In some cases the repairs carried out were very extensive and several additions, alterations and renovations consistent with the prevailing customs and needs of the time have been made, The temple as we view it today is the end product of all such renovations.

At the moment the temple does not present much, of ancient architectural features in its structures. A cursory examination of the architecture of the temple suggests that except for some pieces here and there which are in late Chola style, the rest are in Vijayanagara style of architecture, and many are in very modern styles. A study of the architectural development of the Tirumala Temple based upon literary evidence, stylistic comparisons of individual architectural features, and inscriptional evidence has not upto now been undertaken in a consistant and methodical manner. An attempt is made here to do it. 


## II. Introduction to temple architecture with reference to Agamic rules 


### (a) Agamas and Vyuha theory. 

Before studying the development of the construction of Tirumala temple, it may be useful to have a broad idea of the agamic rules for the construction of temples. Temples in general are intended for the external worship of the Deity as conceived by the ancients. These were consecrated for worship in conformity with the procedure laid down in the Samhitas. The Samhitas are numerous; some expound the tenets of the Vaikhanasa Agama and some others the tenets of the Pancharatra Agama. 

The images of the Dhruva Murti are generally made by the Silpis or sculptors well versed in the Agamic rules for the manufacture of such icons. Some temples have murtis whose origin is not traceable. Some others have been installed by Siddhas or Rishis or Devas or some are said to be Swayamvakta where the Lord manifests himself out of his infinite grace. 

The Agamic rules or the Agama Samhitas lay down procedures for the construction of the temples which are to be built by man and in which murti worship is to be carried on. The Agamas for Vaishnavite worship are two, the Vaikhanasa and the Pancharatra. Each claims for itself greater integrity, sanctity and superiority. To a modern reader the points of agreement in both the systems are so numerous that the differences would appear to be not of very great significance, in as much as the great Acharya Purushas have accorded equal recognition to both. 

The fundamental postulate accepted in Hinduism which is intended to be translated in temple construction and worship is the principle of the evolution of the one Infinite into the varied forms of the manifested world, and the stages by which man in his ignorance can remove these shackles and slowly ascend to his original level of divine consciousness. In this process such well known concepts like Nishkala Brahma, Sakala Brahma, Saguna Brahma etc., are all defined and codified. The ultimate goal of the individual is to free himself from association with the endless cycle of births and deaths and attain a state of eternal communion with the Paramatman. The four ways of reaching this goal are Japa, Homa, Dhyana and Archana. This broad approach is the basic method in its external form to temple construc- tion and worship. 

There are two other concepts to be noticed here namely the Vyuha avatara' and the Vibhava avatara' Vishnu. In the first step of the Vyuha avatara the one infinite Paramatman brings forth into existence, a huge anda or what is technically called ' a golden egg,' which is sub-divided into four further grades called amoda, pramoda, samoda and vaikunta lokas. The jivas are expected to enter from amoda loka to vaikunta loka and to the jiva, Vishnu the Paramatman appears in each of the Lokas, as a graded Deity called Vishnu, Maha-Vishnu, Sada-Vishnu and Sarvavyapi Narayana. The perceptible forms of these amsas (which are intended for image worship) are technically known as Purusha, Satya, Achyuta and Aniruddha. These are called the Vyuha forms of Vishnu and they are four in number, and these have a well defined niche in any temple for worship. In the Agamas besides these four, as many as twentyfour further sub-vyuhas are defined. Each of these has an idol and a specific place to be installed and worshipped in the construction of a temple. 

The Vibhava Avatara on the other hand, is the concept of the Paramatman manifesting himself in human and other forms in order to show the correct path of rectitude to the devotees. Popularly the Vibhava Avatara are said to be ten or the well known Dasavataras-Mathsya, Kurma, Varaha, Vamana, Rama, Balarama, Krishna, etc. The images of these Vyuha avataras are also to be worshipped in the temples. 

The Vyuhamurthis and also other deities like Brahma, Sankara, Indra and other Devas have all their respective allotted [places assigned to them in the architectural design of the temple, as defined in the Agamas. 

In the Pancharatra theory these vyuhas are accepted but forms are not derived from four Brahmagunas accepted in Vaikhanasa but from another set of six gunas. Apart from this all the vyuha stages are acceptable to both the two Agamas, the difference being only the priority to be given to each. 

In the Vaikhanasa agama the purusha is placed on the south side of the east face of the Garbhagriha facing the east, the satya in the south wall, achyuta in the west wall and aniruddha in the north wall. The Pancharatra places the vyuha vasudeva on the east where the Vaikhanasa agama puts the purusha, and in the south will be placed sankarshana and so on in a reverse order of divinity. Thus commencing from the east the Vaikhanasa agama places the vyuhas in the clockwise ascending order of divinity while the Pancharatra places their vyuhas in the descending order. 


### (b) Different types of agamic temples. 

In the design of the temples the agamas follow closely the description given in the puranas. There have been a number of classifications of the temples like the vertical type, the trimurthi type and the dvimurthi type etc., etc. The agamas contemplate different extensive designs, the ideal temple consisting of 12 tiers. Such temples are extremely rare and have been mentioned mostly only in the texts 


### (c) The Eka murthi temple. 

This type is the commonest one now available and has served the test of times. In this type the representation of the vyuhamurthis and some of the Vibhava forms are in vogue. Brahma, Rudra, Markandeya and Brigu are installed in the Garbhagriha as parivara devatas, though in course of time the representation of Brahma and Rudra images was given up. 


### (d) Nava-Shat-Pancha murti alayam. 

Temples of this type may be built in three tiers or two tiers or on the ground floor alone. The overall dimensions of the building would range from nine hastams square to sixty one hastams square in arithmetical progression of two hastams to each side. Thus each side of the square would be 9, 11, 13, 15 to 61 hastams. There could therefore be twenty seven sizes of temples. Temples of a size less than 9 hastams side are also permitted. But they would be so small that kanuka berams for all the nine, six or even five murtis could not conveniently be given accommodation. So they will have to be placed in alcoves in the garbhagriham (abhyantaram) walls. 

The walls of the garbhagriham are called ‘abhyantara bhitti' and the outer walls are called 'bahya bhitti,' both being Sanskrit words for the inner and outer walls. There will be a doorway left in the middle of the cast inner wall and four doorways in the middle of each of the four outer walls. Each side of the garbhagriham will be three hastams; wall thickness one hastam and the width of the corridor round it one hastam. This allocation holds good whether the temple has three or two tiers or is only a ground floor structure. The compound wall is called 'bahya kudyam.' The corridor space left between the abhyantaram and the bahya bhitti walls is called * alindram.* 

If the temple is built in three tiers it is called a Tritala alayam; if in two tiers, Dvitalam and if only on the ground floor it is called Eka-talam. 


### (e) Tritala Nava murti alayam. 

In this type the centrally situated twnety five squares, (which is the same thing as saying the space allotted for the garbhagriham and the abhyantaram walls) will be left vacant without any murti being placed therein. On the other hand the ground floor would be built substantially so as to act as a sound foundation and basement for the second and the third tiers. On all the four sides of the alindram (or corridor) the vyuha murtis will be installed -Purusha in the east wing, Satya in the south wing, Achyuta in the west wing and Aniruddha in the north wing. There will be a flight of steps leading to the second tier. The bahya bhitti walls will have large openings in each wing and be provided with jalakam (or trellis pattern bay window) so that the murtis installed in the alindram could be seen from the mukha mantapam in front of each. 


### (ƒ) Dvitala alayam. 

In this type the Adi murti Vishnu would be installed in the ground floor (adha stalam) in the middle space (nine small squares) in bhoga asana posture, In the alindram surrounding the garbhagriham the Vyuha murtis would be installed as described already with this difference that Purusha Murti would be to the south of the east door way of the garbhagriham abutting the abbyantaram wall. All will face outwards. In the second tier, in the central space will be installed the yoga sayana murti. 


### (g) Pancha Murti alayam-dvitalam. 

Adi murti Vishnu would be installed in the second tier. On the ground floor Purusha, Satya, Achyuta and Aniruddha as before on the four sides obtained, either by blocking up the central nine squares alone or the central twenty five squares. All the murtis would face outwards. If it is found difficult to have separate Vimanams over each of the Dhruva Murtis, the Eka tala temple might be provided with a single Vimanam so as to cover the entire space occupied by all the Murtis. 


### (h) Eka tala Eka Vimana Nava-Shad Pancha Murti alayam. 

The type is a cheap alternative and could be constructed so as to be less than 9 hastams square, if so desired. The sides would be divided into nine equal parts each way so as to give 81 equal small squares. Or each side might be divided into 11 equal parts, resulting in the formation of 121 equal small squares. In either case the central 25 squares will be allotted for the garbha- griham and the abhyantaram walls. According to the second method the alindram would get 56 squares and bahir bhithi 40 squares. In other words the garbha griham will be three units square, the abhyantaram wall and the bahir bhithi one unit thick and the alindram would get a little more space. The Adi murti and the Vyuha murtis would be installed as before. Narayana, would be near the south west end of the south face of the alindram; Nrisimha near the North West end of the west face and Varaha near the North West end of the north face 


### (i) Eka tala Ekamurti alayam. 

The Eka tala Eka murti alayam is not only confined to a single floor but is also dedicated to the worship of a single Dhruva Murti and its Kautuka Beram. Its Vimanam covers only the garbha griham. A simple design of a skeleton temple (Ekatala Eka Murti) of the current type will have the garbha griham and the mukha mantapam, which is its ante-chamber as an integral structure up to the roof. The Vimanam would cover only the garbha griham, its walls and the terrce. Mukha mantapam will have only the terraced roof. The width of the mukha mantapam would be about the same as that of the garbha griham; but its length would be such that the area of its floor space equals the area of the Vimanam at its base. When the murti to be installed is in the standing or sitting posture the garbha griham would be square in shape. The floor space (and therefore one side of this square space) is usually calculated after deciding on the area of the base of the vimana (which determines the height or the vimanam also). The rule of thumb practice is to make the area of the garbha griham 1/3, 2/4, 3/5, 4/7, 5/9 or 6/11th part of the base area of the Vimanam. In the design of the Nava Shat Pancha murti alayam (Eka tala Eka Vimanam) the rule was much cruder still. There will be an open space left at the terrace level on all the sides of these two structures (excepting on the front side) which space is called antaralam. This open space separates the two structures from the corridor which surrounds them on all sides. This corridor is called the ' antarmandalam.' The antar- mandalam corresponds to the alindram of the Nava Shat Pancha murti alayam. The roof of the antarmandalam is carried on walls on the outer side and on a row of stone pillars on the inner side on the three sides excepting the front. The slope of the terrace would be outwards. On the front side the antarmandalam widens into an ardha mantapam or snapana mantapam and is also called vesaram. Right below the antaralam opening and at the ground level there will be a fairly wide cutstone drain running round the three sides. The drainage water from the garbha griham will find its way into this drain by an outlet in the north wall of the garbha griham having a carved face, like the face and mouth of a cow and therefore called gomukham. The rain water flowing down the Vimanam will also fall into this drain All the drainage water will be led into the Pushkarini or the holy tank which is usually situated on the north side of the temple and near the outer-most prakaram or compound wall. No part of the roof of the corridor (antar- mandalam) will rest on or have contact with the garbha griham walls. On the front side the corridor roof would rest on the east wall of the mukha mantapam. 

It will be seen that the garbha griham, the mukha mantapam antar- mandalam have doorways placed centrally on the east side only. Attached to the east face of the antarmandalam will be an asthana mantapam used for festival purposes. This mantapam would be an open cut stone structure carried on 16, 32, or 64 pillars. 

It is usual to have the shrine of Garuda (the Divine Eagle) in the middle of the eastern fringe of the above mantapam. The Dhvajastambham and Balipitham would be to the east of this Shrine. There are however alternative sites assigned for these which will be explained later. 

The walls of the antarmandalam are also known as the first avaranam or prakaram walls. There will be a fairly wide quadrangular open space running round these walls and the asthana mantapam. This space is enclosed by another set of quadrangular walls (massive and high) known as the second prakaram or avaranam walls. There will be one wide and high opening on the cast wall, corresponding to the doorways in the garbha griham, mukha mantapam and the first avaranam but very much higher and wider giving an imposing appearance. The roof will be surmounted by a gopuram. The opening is usually called a mukhadvaram. Very many temples are content with having this second avaranam, its mukhadvaram and gopuram. A few have another set of quadrangular walls, mukhadvaram and gopuram with the open space between the second wall and this one made much wider than the second avaranam space. 

These three avaranams play an important part in the daily rituals of worship. Important Devas and Devatas are presumed to occupy their allotted places therein. Although at one time they were represented by images it is not the practice now. 


### (j) The Garbhagriha Padavinyasa, 

The division of the floor space of the garbha griham into four zones, cach outer zone surrounding the next inner one is called in the language of the Agamas, Garbhagriha Pada Vinyasam. This division is made so that the images in the garbha griham may be arranged in the order which the Agamas prescribe. If the temple is consecrated for installing a Dhruva Murti and a Kautuka Beram the division will be in one way; if there is no Kautuka Beram and a Dhruva Murti alone is installed and worshipped the division is effected in a different manner. The four zones are named thus. The central zone is called Brahmyam; the one which surrounds it is called Daivikam; the third zone which surrounds the Daivikam is called Manusham; the outermost one is called Paisacham. The import of these terms is so patent that no lengthy explanation is necessary. If the temple has in the garbha griham a Dhruva Murti and its Kautuka Beram, the Kautukam should be installed in the central zone called Barhmyam. Most part of the daily archana will be to the Kautuka Beram and through it to the Dhruva Murti. If the temple was consecrated without the Kautukam, then the Dhruva Murti would occupy the Brahmyam space. All archana would be done to the Dhruva Murti directly. 

The Murti should be located on the pitham which consists of four planks (Dharmam, Jnanam, Aiswaryam and Vairagyam) bound together by three glittering bands called Trimekhala running round the four sides and spaced at equal intervals. On the pitham and under the murti is the eight or sixteen petal Padmam. 


### (k) The other Devatas. 

In the more ancient temples these images could be seen even now. But in recent constructions they are omitted. During the daily puja however they have to be thought of and nyasa flowers in their name deposited between the feet of the Dhruva murti. These devas are of two classes. Some are presumed to be present at all times and under all conditions. Others are permitted to be present when the Dhruva Murti is in certain Sthitis; such as Yoga, Bhoga and Vira. 

Dvara devas, dvarapalas, Vimana palas, Vishvaksena, Sri Bhutam and Garuda will always be in their respective places. They are anapayins. Brahma, Sankara, Markandeya, and Bhrigu will not be present in certain Sthitis. But during the daily puja they are treated as being present and nyasam is done for them and the flower placed between the feet of the Dhruva murti. Their names and the place they occupy will now be given. 

Vishvaksena:-He is as it were the commander-in-chief of the divine forces or, Vishnu ganas. His place is at the north-east corner of the north side of the first avaranam close to the foot of the Vimanam facing south. He is agni colour, wears yellow (pita) clothes; has all Vishnu's abharanams excepting Srivatsam and Yagnopavita; has two hands; wears flower garlands; holds sakti dandam; Jayapati; Srunga ketu. 

There are several types of Vimanams, three of which are Santika, the Paushtika and the Jayada types. Enumeration of the several types would interest only those who study the architectural side of the temple, and will therefore be omitted here. The more common type has a square base and is in height, about 1 to 2 times the side of the base. It may consist of two, three or more tiers. Images made in stucco are usually set up on the four faces in each tier and at the angular points. The neck portion between one tier and the next one above are also adorned with images. 

The agamas also lay extensive detailed rules for the placement of the dvitiya avaranas and the tritiya avarana devatas and places for the devatas of the 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th avaranas and dvarapalas also where such extensive temples have been built. 

It is possible to make out a chart showing the devas, dvarapalas in the avaranas whatever be their number and the precise place allotted to the several images according to the avaranas. This will be of interest to a serious student of agamas. The Tirumala temple broadly follows the above injuctions of the agamas, 


### III. First phase on the construction of the Tirumala temple (An open mandapa). 

Legends have it that the Tirumala Temple was originally built by a King called Tondaman who was the younger brother of Akasa Raja of the lunar race. The Akasa Raja found Goddess Padmavati in a lotus and brought here up and ultimately got her married to Lord Srinivasa. Very soon after the marriage Akasa Raja died and his brother Tondaman and son Vasudana fought for the throne. Lord Srinivasa, the son-in-law of the family interfered in the dispute, and divided the kingdom between the two disputants, the Tondaman getting Tondaimandalam and Vasudana getting Narayanavanam. This king Tondaman was in his earlier birth the famous devotee Rangadasa whose story is found in the Brahmandapurana. So in continuation of the previous birth, the Lord commanded Tondaman to build a fine temple for the residence of the Lord. Tondaman constructed this temple and this is the Tirumala Temple of the Lord Venkatesa. The above is a legendary story connected with the construction of the Temple. 

It is the universal belief that Vengadam with the Lord Venkatesa has existed from times immemorial and that the Deity is a self-created or a 'Svayambhu' one. 

The term * Vengadam ' meaning the name of the hill is found in the ancient Tamil grammar Tolkappiyam composed about the 1st Century A.D. Mamular, the Sangam poet of the 2nd Century A.D. also calls the hill by the same name and gives a vivid description of the fairs and festivals held there. These two do not specifically mention the temple. The famous Tamil classic 'Silappadhikaram' of the 1st Century A.D. makes a clear reference to the Deity and the Hill. 

The Vaishnavite Alvars who flourished during the later Pallava period say by the 8th Century A.D. have sung innumerable poems in praise of the main Vishnu shrines of South India. They have sung songs about the image of the Lord located at Vengadam but do not refer specifically to the temple. All the Alvars except Thondaradippodi, have sung in praise of the Deity and the hill. Descriptions of the temples and their prakaras in other sacred places like Srirangam, Kanchi etc., are found in the Nalayira Divya Prabandham but not about Tirumala. Alvars like Kulasekhara Alvar and Tirumangai- mannan, while describing Srirangam refer to the extent of the temple and its prakaras; but when singing about Vengadam they praise in ecstatic terms only the Deity and the hill but only casually if at all mention the existence of a temple there. Thus upto 8th Century A.D., there is no evidence what- soever about the temple or its technical features as such. 

The earliest inscriptional evidence available to us about the temple is found on a slab at the Vahana mantapa at Tirumala and is now preserved in a platform in the same temple. This fragmentary inscription mentions that a son named Bhupala was born to the victorious Vijayaditya, who bore the burden of the earth like Sarika birds being born on the earth. The simili of a Sarika bird's birth to a crowned prince is not only inapt but also inept. It is generally believed that this inscription commemorates the birth of king Vijayatiya, son of the Bana ruler Manali Banaraya who from other historical evidence is known to us as having lived around about 790 A.D. 

The inscribed stone on which the above epigraph is found is a loose one not forming part of the temple. It is therefore extremely doubtful whether it could be said that this formed part of the architecture of the Tirumala temple temple at the close of the 8th Century A.D. 


### IV. Second phase of the construction of the Tirumala temple 

(A rudimentary enclosure). 

The above facts would indicate that there is no evidence that there was at all a temple as such to Lord Venkatesa till the end of the 8th Century though the image might have stood for all to see and worship from a very long time, in an open mantapa. 

The above inference would gain support and strength from the following deductions that could reasonably be drawn from the evidence of the hymns of the Alvars. 

One of the Alvars Tirumalisi Alvar has clearly stated that the Lord Venkatesa could be seen from all sides and from anywhere. This statement taken literally would clearly indicate that the image of the Tiruvengadamudayan or Sri Venkatesvara could be seen from anywhere only because it was located in an open mantapa without any enclosures. On the other hand Kulasekhara Alvar expressly mentions that one of his ambitions in his life is to be born again and again as a padi or a pedestal, before the Lord, so that he could always enjoy having the ecstatic darshan of the graceful looks of the Lord. This statement would indicate that when Kulasekhara Alvar composed this song, there were enclosing structures around the image, since a padi or pedestal would be impossible without some kind of enclosure. 

Depending on the above statements, we could perhaps conclude, that originally the image of Lord Venkatesa stood on a pedestal in an open mantapa, and that an enclosing temple or Garbha griha was built between the times of Tirumalisi Alvar and Kulasekhara Alvar. Generally the accepted dates of the Alvars is about the 8th Century A.D. Hence it is possible to conjecture that round about the 8th Century A.D. there must have been a small temple to the Deity probably made of bricks. This is fully supported by our general knowledge of the evolution of temple architecture, since in South India architecture came into vogue only with the Vishnukundins, and the structural temples came into practice only in the later part of the 8th Century A.D. 

It is therefore impossible to arrive at any other conclusion than that by the 8th Century A.D. The Tirumala Temple had gone through two stages of temple construction viz., an open mandapa and a small enclosure between the times of Tirumalisi and Kulasekhara alvars. 


### V. The third phase of the construction of the Tirumala Temple. 

(A regular Garbha and Antarala). 

From the 8th Century A.D. to the 10th Century A.D. At an unknown date a regular temple with a regular Garbha griħa and probably an antarala came into being. There is clear epigraphical evidence to prove this. On the north wall in the 1st prakara of the Tirumala temple is found the famous inscription of Samavai alias Kadavan Perundevi, queen of Sakti Vitankan, who, in the 14th year of the reign of Koppatra Mahendra Panmar I arranged for the daily propitiation (nimandam) with 4 nali of cooked rice (tiruvamudu, and one perpetual lamp (nandavilakku), for the conduct of ablutions (tirumanjanam) on the two Ayana-Sankranti and the two Vishu-Sankranti (days) and for the celebration of the Purattasi festival wherein to conduct a festival for two days before the commencement of the (main) festival and to conduct the (main) festival for nine days beginning with the seed-sowing (tirumulai-yatti) on the day of Chittirai (star), for the Manavalapperumal (image) made of silver and installed in the Tiruvilankoyil after performing special worship for the God presiding over the sacred Venkata Hill and after presenting for the consecrated silver image : 

(1) 1 crown (tirumudi) containing 23 diamonds, 16 big pearls, 2 big central rubies and 3 cut rubies, in all 5 rubies. 

(2) 2 ornaments (of the shape of the) makara and 1 pair of coral koppu for the two holy ears. 

(3) 4 strings (malai) for the holy neck into which are set 14 diamonds, rubies, 11 big pearls and many (small red pearls), 

(4) 1 belt (udarabandhanam) of gold. 

(5) 1 girdle (tiruvarai-pattikai) with 4 rubies, 

(6) 2 circular ornaments for the arms (bahuvalayam), 

(7) 4 bracelets (tiruchchandam) set with 2 cut rubies, 

(8) 4 circular ornaments (valaiyal) for the holy neck, 

(9) 2 solid anklets (karai) for the holy feet,  \
being ornaments made of gold set with precious stones, corals and pearls, totalling 52 articles; 

(10) 2 anklets with belts (padachayalam) and 1 luminous disc (prabha) of silver set with 1 big central ruby; the gold used in making these articles being 47 kalanju; 

and the land given to this Manavalapperumal, for whom all these (ornaments) were presented and ablutions were also conducted and who was consecrated, comprises the pieces of land purchased from the Sabhaiyar of Tiruchchukanur situated in the Tirukkudavur-nadu in Sri Venkata-kottam and from Lakshmana. nambi residing in the Matham and for which was also paid money to the God Tiruvilankoyil-Perumal and which was made tax-free; the piece of land purchased from the Sabhaiyar; the pieces of land known as Nandi-erippatti, Nadupputtai, Lakshmananambi-adaikonda-nilam (land held by Lakshmana- nambi), Madhusudan-aviyarai and Purushottaman-patti, aggregating to 3 putti of land; measured with the kadikkai-kol (measuring pole) and reckoned to be 3000 kuli as equated with the rod of 16 spans; and this land has been purchased after paying the purchase money to the Sabhaiyar and to the deity, and made tax-free and presented to serve for the propitiation of Manavalapperumal. 

The above detailed inscription clearly shows the existence of a regular temple with the Utsava murthi at this time, the temple being called Tiruvilan Kovil. The consecration of an utsava murthi suggests the existence of an antarala. 

Other epigraphic evidence in the temple also support this view. The eight inscriptions (218,219,220,223,229,232,233,234-G.T.) giving details about the Hill temple are found at Tiruchanur temple. The earliest of them is dated 826 A.D. This tells us about the existence of a proxy (second Murti) Tiruvengadathupperumanadigal also known as Tiruvilankoilperuman, in the Tiruvilankoil at Tiruchanur. A second inscription (of the time of the reign of Vijaya Aditya, about 870 A.D.) informs us of the existence of a third Murti, apart from the Mula Bera and His proxy, Tiru- mantrasalai Perumanadigal. Tirumantra Salai is the temple or the place where the converts to Sri Vaishnavite faith were initiated into Tirumantram. The third interesting inscription, in the time of Chola King, Parantaka 1 (945 A.D.) gives details about the burning of a perpetual lamp in front of Tiruvengadam temple. Tiruvilankoil and Tirumantra-Salai at Tiruchanur are not mentioned later than 1000 A.D. 

For a long time after the construction of the Snapana Mandapa, there was no activity till the weakness of Chola power gave room for the local Yadava rulers and others to assert independence. In the latter part of the eleventh century, after the death of Sri Ramanuja (after 1150 A.D.), the development of the temple commenced and continued even to 15th and 16th centuries. It is the later Yadava rulers who were largely responsible for making the temple big and also sound in finance. When we examine the inscriptions on the Hill, they yield several interesting details regarding the construction of the various mandapas and gopuras. 

The history of the temple upto this time would then be somewhat as follows: 

Finding the Hill very inaccessible to devotees, a Tiruvilankoil to house the representative or rather the proxy of the Hill Deity was built in the Tiruchanur temple about the year 826 A.D. and an icon was consecrated in it to satisfy the cravings of the devotees to worship the Mula-Murti on the Hills with all the ecstacy in which the Alvars have sung Him. Another Murti was also installed at Tiruchanur about 870 A.D. Soon after that, Sri Parasaresvara temple, now in utter ruins and attached to the Tiruttani Devasthanam temples became prominent, supported by the ruling Chola prince. So, to avoid sectarian faction, the then leader of Sri Vaishnavite community thought it safe to transfer the worship of the Tiruvengadam God to His rightful place on the Hill. This happened when Sri Alavandar and his grandson Tirumalai-Nambi were alive-about 960 A.D. When Sri Ramanuja (born in 1017 A.D.) saw a small temple on an inaccessible Hill, he at once planned to enlarge it. Besides, at this time, the Chola king ordered the image of Govindaraja at Chidambaram to be thrown into the sea. That icon was brought by Sri Ramanuja to lower Tirupati. It was installed in a separate shrine erected inside Sri Parthasarathi temple now called Sri Govinda- raja Perumal temple. Then lower Tirupati was made to serve as a base to commence the upward pilgrimueg. Thus, the history of the Hill temple commencing from the Tirucnahar temple shifted to lower Tirupati and from there to the Hill. 


### (vi) Examination of the Architectural features of the Garbha griha. 

For a detailed study of the architectural growth of the temple one has to start from the Garbha griha or the sanctum sanctorum cover the Mukkoti Pradakshinam, the first circumambulatory passage, then the second prakara or the outer pradakshinam. The architectural features noticed on the various structures help us to study broadly the architectural development of the temple. 

At present the Garbha griha has an Ardhamantapa (now called as Sayana- mantapa), and an Antarala (now called as Ramar medai) which form the first unit of the inner prakara. 

Both the Garbha griha and the Ardhamantapa are square in shape, the measurement of the garbha griha being 12'-9' and that of the Aradhana being 13'-9'. The Antarala measures 10'-6" by 12′-9′′. 

The architectural peculiarities in the above are listed below: 

(a) When their measurements are taken and checked, it is found that  their walls are 7 ½  feet thick. But the wall thickness of the Snapana Mandapa built in front of the Antarala and the outer walls of the Mukkoti Pradakshina measure only 4' 6”, which itself is high. Usually 3' 3" thickness is met with in temples of this kind. 

(b) The building of two pials on North and South sides of the Antarala- Mandapa. Probably the door-ways in them were blocked up and pials were built to hide the new work. 

(c) The absence of a Gomukhi in the Garbha Griba. 

(d) Few original Inscriptions prior to 12th century seen on the outer walls 

(e) The architectural features noticed on the outer walls, in cornices roshtams, stambha varis and bases. These peculiarities, to some extent, guide us to follow the architectural growth of this unit. 

Some explanation has to be found for the above peculiarities, and especially for the nearly 8’ thickness of the walls of the garbha griha. The probabilities are discussed below. 

236 


### (vii) The fourth phase of the construction of the Tirumala temple, 

(The Garbhagriha assumes the present form and vimana is built). 

The old Silpis used for their measurements the old bandam, hastam and manangulam which are the traditional units of measurement. Usually the thickness of the walls were in the units of a hastam or a half or a quarter and sometimes 1/8th hastam also were used. Traditionally 24 manangulams made up one hastam. In many temples as in those at Kanchipuram, the precise length of the hastam is actually engraved on the walls of the temple. 

According to the old Silpa texts, the sanctum sanctorum had its size determined so as to be proportionate to the size and the posture of the Dhruva Beram. For a murti of the standing posture, with no other murti on the side, the agamas lay down that the Garbha griha may be in the form of a square called Ekatala or a single plot. The dimensions of the side of the square would depend on the height of the Dhruva Beram of the Lord. The hastam is usually the length of a hand and will vary from one sculptor to another. From the dimensions of the Garbha griha of Lord Venkatesvara, the hastam used by the Silpi for this temple would measure 17" in length. 

Thus the inner measurement of the Garbha griha being 12′ 6′′, comes to a 9 hastams square. In fact, this is the largest size mentioned in the agamas, and had apparently been adopted for this temple as the idol of the Lord is very high and as this is an Ekamurti temple. 

The agama rules also lay down elaborate instructions about the thickness of the walls of the Garbha griha. The thickness bears a constant proportion which the inside floor space of the Garbha griha should bear to the base of the proposed Vimanam, which the walls have to carry. Normally the proportion would be ½ , ⅓ rd, ⅗ th, 4/7 th, 5/9th, 6/11th etc., etc. In other words the proportion varied between half and 1/3rd. 

The area of the base of the Garbha griħa being (12′-9′′), and since on an average, the proportion of the area of the Garbha griha to base of the Vimana is ½ , the area of the Vimana could only be 2×(12′-9′′)<sup>2</sup>(ie., 324sq. feet. The side of the Vimana square, which will be equal to the length of the wall of the Garbha Griha and twice the thickness of the surrounding wall, would be the square root of 324 or 18'. Deducting from this 12' 9", which is the inner length of the Garbha Griha, we have twice the thickness of the walls as 5' 3" or the thickness of each wall of the Garbha griha would be 314” or slightly more than 2} feet. The thickness could thus have only less than two hastams as per the measurement laid down in the Silpa texts. 

237 

At the moment the overall thickness of the wall is 7′ 9′′ a little over 5 hastams. 

The above mathematical calculation clearly proves that there are two walls enclosing the Garbha griha an inner one being the original wall of the thickness of 2 hastams, and the second wall slightly of about 3 hastams in thickness so that at the moment, the wall gives us a thickness of five hastams, 

The present thickness of the walls viz.,5 hastams might be made up either of the second wall closely embracing the inner wall or withan air space of say about 6" left between the two walls. Soundings from the walls of Mukkoti Pradakshina would indicate that there is actually an air space between the two walls. Such a space is also known to agamic text as antarmandalam or antaralam. 

Hence it is clear that sometime later than the date of Samavai ie., later than 10th century, the temple has undergone a fourth phase with the walls of the Garbha Griha doubled up. It is possible to approximately arrive at the date of this. 

In one inscription which is well-known and which is found on the north wall of the 1st prakara of the Tirumala temple (No. 17—T.T.)there is mention of extensive renovations of the temple which is mentioned as ' Kovil Alvarukku Kovilukku Kovil Seyya' that is for the construction of a temple to the temple of Kovil alvar. The full text of the inscription is as follows:- 

Hail, Prosperity! On the 20th day in the mouth of Arpasi in the 40th year of the reign of Nayanar Vira-Narasingadeva Yadavarayar, on the receipt of the order of Nayapar by the Sthanattar (to the effect) that, at the time of the commencement by Tiruppullanidasar, one of the Desantaris, of the renovation of the shrine of Koyilalvar, the old inscriptions engraved on the central shrine built in the past shall be re-engraved at the north corner on the outer side of the first prakara, and the Sthanattar having, in pursuance of the order, directed their re-engraving, this is the document so re-engraved on Friday combined with Uttiradam, being the 22nd day of the Chittirai month in the same year of reign, to wit, 

In the 16th year of the reign of Ko-Vira-Rajarajendra-Panmar, “who,~~ while (his) heart rejoiced, that, like the goddess of fortune, the goddess of the great earth had become his wife,-in his life of growing strength, during which, having been pleased to destroy the ships (at) Kandalur-Salai, he conquered by his army, which was victorious in great battles,” Vengainadu, Tulappadi (Nulamba-padi), Ganga-padi, Kadigai-vili (Tadigai-vali), Kudamalainadu,, Kollapuram (Kollam) and Kalingam,-"deprived the Seliyas of their splendour while (he) was resplendent (to such a degree) that (he) was worthy to be worshipped every where,” 

The pattam (ornamental plate for the forehead) presented by the chief queen of him (the king)who slept (died) at the Golden Hall and the daughter of the Cheramanar (Chera king) is 52 kalanju of gold weighed by the kudri naikkal and contains 6 rubies, 4 diamonds and 28 pearls. This pattam Parantakadevi-amman presented to Tiruvenkatadevar. 

Among Srivaishnavas the term Kovil alvar is a well understood one. It stands for a wooden structure of the usual type having a small room and a small mantapa of the same height of the room. 

Hence somewhere during the renovation period between the 12th and 13th century A.D.a second wall was built round the first wall perhaps to take the weight of the Vimanam which must have been constructed only then while at the same time the Mukkoti Prakaram was also enclosed on all the four sides to make it the first avarana. 

From other inscriptions of the temple it is seen that Sundara Pandya gold gilded the Kalasa on the Vimana and that Viranarasingaraya who was a feudatory chief of the Pandya king for sometime and who afterwards became an independent king himself, performed the tulabhara, and weighed himself against gold and made use of that gold to make the temple shine like a *Suragirt of the Devas.' Thus during this period of the 13th century A.D. big renovation works had taken place and the whole vimana was made and gold gilded, and the outer walls of the temple were also constructed to take the weight of the vimana, leaving the mukkoti pradakshina as the first avarana of the temple. 


### (viii) The fifth phase of the construction of the Tirumala temple-the closure of Ramar medai. 

We find that this first favaraam or pradakshinam deliberately built was soon closed. Two inscriptions on the south face of the south wall of the Ramar Medal go to show that this closure would have taken place some- time after '1262 A.D. when Sundara Pandya placed a gold gilt kalasam on top of the Vimanam and when in all likelihood Vira Narasinga Yadavaraya made a gold gilt copper sheet covering, to the vimanam. The two inscriptions referred to above,  relate to one Vijayaganda Gopala, a Telugu Pallava chieftain who was one of undara Pandya's adherents just like Vira Narasinga. The date usually assigned to him as a ruler is 1250-1285 A.D. But his political life should have commenced much earlier. There are fragmentary inscriptions on the inner face of the Mukkoti pradakshinam walls which go to show that some of his gifts were made before the construction of the new temple and of the new prakaram walls. Of the two inscriptions which are on the south wall of the Ramar Madai one is a complete inscription and was pre sumably inscribed after that wall of the Ramar Medai was constructed. It extols Vijayaganda Gopala for his charitable disposition and states that every living being was benefited by him and that every one was grateful to him. The other inscription is an incomplete one and even fragmentary. The queen of Vijayaganda by name Devarasiyar presented cows for the perpetual lighting of three lamps in Sri Venkatesvara's temple. 

When an incomplete inscription of this type is seen on a new wall of a later date the inference would be that the stone was originally in some other place and was subsequently taken out and set in its present place. It would originally have been on the South wall of the new prakaram at its junction with the east wall. To form the Ramar Medai that end would have been cut open and the stones removed in the process used for the Ramar Medaiwall. The inscribed stone might have got mutilated in the process of removal and re-setting. The surmise therefore is that the Ramar Medai was formed sometime between 1262 and 1285 A.D. The eastern end of the south and the north prakaram walls would thus have been opened out while walling up the Ramar Medai. Although the formation of the Ramar Medai blocked up the eastern wing, the other three sides of the pradakshinam were perhaps open to the public for some years. The doors and the walls which now completely seal the pradakshinam are of later date and are not in keeping with the other parts of the structure. 

The reason as to why the Ramar Medai was closed cannot now be stated with complete certainty. Either it might have been done for the purposes of safety or it might have been deliberately done to frustrate any attempt to instal murthis in the niches of the Mukkoti pradakshina as a Kovil for two additional murthis, since perhaps after the religious reforms brought about Ramanuja, people might have been overanxious to prevent the Pancharatras by forming a chaturmurti alaya in the temple by putting up Pancharatra images on the outer faces of the south west and north walls of the Garbha griha. 

240 

SEVEN PHASES IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE TIRUMALA TEMPLE 

In inscription (No. 17-T.T.) the old temple is called the Koyil alvar and the renovation work is called Koyil or temple. The latter was meant to serve as a temple to house the former, which even now is called Koyilalvars. 

The old temple had a covered corridor surrounding it on all sides, with an open or covered antaralam to permit rain water from the vimanam or roof to flow into the drain below surrounding the walls. These had to be demolished to make room for the foundations and walls of the new structure. The old prakaram walls should have been demolished before the foundations for the new temple were laid. The inscription does not speak of the old prakaram walls nor does it state in clear terms that new praka- ram walls were built. It says that certain old inscriptions which were on the walls of the old temple and true copies of which were already taken (before building the new temple walls) should be reengraved on the outer face of the north wall of the first prakaram. That there were the old pra- karam walls together with pradakshinam could easily be understood from the very large number of stones showing fragmentary and incomplete inscriptions which have been built into the inner face of the walls of the new pradakshinam and also the roughly dressed bald round stone columns used in the new pradakshinam. These columns do not go well with the architect- ural beauty and finish of the new temple walls. The inner faces of the new prakaram walls containing fragmentary inscriptions on the roughly dressed faces of the old stones present a sorry contrast to the walls of the new temple. The portion of the old temple from which these stones could have come should be the old prakaram. The new pradakshinam along with its prakaram walls is also called a temple in the inscription "Kovilalvarukku Kovil" (a temple for the temple of the Koyilalvar). It is unusual to call the first pradakshinam a temple. A temple usually contains an image for worship. So we must presume that this new pradakshinam was designed to hold within it one or more images for worship. The design of the outer face of the new Garbhagriham walls and the closure of the antaralam space in the roof of the pradakshinam support this view. A look at the south wall will show that a niche is sculptured centrally in the body of the wall. There are similar nicheson the western and northern walls also. There was (and probably still is) oneon the cast wall also, a little to the south of the doorway. This has been covered up by one of the thick walls subsequently formed which enclose the Ramar Medai. The space enclosed by these two bits of walls on the south and north sides formed the eastern wing of the new pradakshinam. This was however subsequently walled up. These niches form an essential feature 

16 

241 

THE TIRUMALA TEMPLE 

of the design of garbhagrihams according to the Vaikhanasa as well as the Pancharatra agamas. The Vaikhanasas attach greater importance to them. In fact they would have had three more niches at corners on the south, west and north faces to install deities in all these. It is with a view to preventing rain water from dripping upon and beating against the images that the antaralam or open space in the terrace was closed, leaving only small openings to admit a little light. 


### (ix) Sixth phase of the construction of Tirumala temple--and construction of Tirumamani mandapa. 

This is a 16 pillared mukha mandapa built in front of the Snapana mandapa and is the eastern most mandapa in front of the garbhagriha. This 16-pillared mandapa was built by one Mallanna alias Madhava Dasa of Chandragiri in Saka 1339 corresponds to 1417 A.D. An inscription near the Yaga sala specifically mentions this. 

Thus this is a mandapa built in the early Vijayanagara style. It is now called Mukha mandapa and serves as Asthana mandapa. Its pillars have flower-like corbels. The mandapa with its pillars and stylistic corbels and kodugus and sculptures is an elegant example of the early Vijayanagar style. 


### (x) Seventh phase of the construction of Tirumala temple (Garuda temple). 

At the eastern end of the Tirumamani mandapa is a small shrine to Garuda. A close examination of this shrine shows that it is a later addition in the mandapa being a structure standing in the end centre span of the mandapa and projec- ting a little outside from the front plinth line. This shrine of garuda is a very crude modern addition and must have been built very late long after the erection of the Tirumamani mandapa when the festivals got multiplied. 


### (xi) Other structures of Tirumala temple. 


#### (a) Madil-P-Patti Mandapas etc. 

The above four structures of the main shrine enclose the Vimana Pradakshina with big madil (compound) walls. The East wall is pierced to take the inner Gopura. The South, West and North madil walls have Madil-p patti Mandapas (Mandapas erected attached to and in front of Madil walls), structures like the Kalyana Mandapa and shrines like those to Sri Ramanuja. All these are in late Vijayanagar and modern styles. Except the Kalyana Mandapa, others are not worthy of note from the architectural view point. Their modern nature is evident from the style of the various pillars and their capitals and also from the scores of sculptures engraved on pillars based on several non-Agamic mythological anecdotes. The thick pillar with a warrior riding on a Yali on its base, Pushpabodhikai (flower capital) on top, several small figures and Kumbha-Pancharam sculptured on it, compel one to place the Kalyana mandapa in Vijayanagar period, before 1600 A.D. and after 1300 A.D. 

There are three important shrines in this prakara-shrines to Varadaraja, Ramanuja, and Narasimha. In the first shrine, the outer walls are in late Chola style. The earliest inscription on them is dated as 16th regnal year of Sri Ranganatha Yadavaraya. Tradition claims that this shrine was specially built to house temporarily Sri Varadaraja, the famous utsava deity from Kanchi, during Malik Kafur's invasion of the South. Regarding Ramanuja's shrine, its position clearly indicates that it must have been a later addition. It abuts a little into the north side prakara. Its architectural features, lion base pillars and highly ornamental kodungai are of Vijayanagar type. The carliest inscription on its walls is of the year 1476. We know well that Sri Ramanuja was very much associated with the Hill temple and that he did much to enhance its fame. At Tirumala, the next place to Sri Venkatesvara is given to Ramanuja. So, when a temple was built for him at lower Tirupati about 1200 A.D. it is probable that a shrine or an icon of his must have existed in the Hill temple also. Tradition claims that the shrines to Sri Ramanuja at Tirumala and Tirupati were constructed more or less in the same period. It is believed that a statue of Ramanuja was modelled in his presence at his 45th year and came to be installed at the Hill soon after his death, as ordered by Sri Venkatesvara Himself. The Guruparampara tells us that soon after his death Pillai-Tirumalai Nambi installed one image of Ramanuja in the shrine of Tiruvengadamudaiyan. Hence till the construction of the shrine, the icon might have been placed along with others in Sri Venkatesvara's shrine itself, as there could not be independent puja for any other deity except to Sri Venkatesvara. The shrine to Narasimha too is said to have been constructed to house either Sholangipuram or Ahobilam utsava deity. But it does not look so. This shrine is a make-shift arrangement and forms part and parcel of the madil-p-patti mandapa. 

(b) Inner Gopura. 

There are several fragmentary inscriptions on its base. The earliest of them narrates the pledge of Venkatatturaivar to carry on the Nandavanam, 

243 

THE TIRUMALA TEMPLE 

Amudu Padi and Sattupadi Kainkaryams and it is dated about 1150 A.D. Among the complete detailed inscriptions, the earliest is 1220 A.D. But we know that the temple was largely renovated in about 1250 A.D. So it can be said with some certainty that the gopura must have been completed somewhere in 1250 A.D. The style of the sculptural works on it too agrees with the above date. 

(c) Dhvaja-stambha Mandapa. 

This is a simple pillared mandapa to house the holy Stambha and the Balipitha. Like in several big temples, both are located in the outer prakara. It is quite likely that first the Dhavaja-stambha and Balipitha were in the inner prakara and that when the Tirumamani Mandapa was erected in 1417 A.D., both were got shifted to the present position. There is not much of architecture in the mandapa. It is in late Vijayanagar style. Reference to inscriptions support the same. In the inscription (No. 18-T.T.) we hear of the consecration of a silver Murti, a representative of Sri Venkatesvara, for processional purposes. The Pallava queen who installed the icon, also arranged for the conduct of festivals in the month of Purattasi and Margali by purchasing and granting lands. Thus even so early as the 10th century, we understand that the original annual festival was celebrated in the month of Purattasi. This festival is usually known as Brahmotsavam, since it was originally instituted and conducted by Brahma according to the Venkatachala-Mahatmyam. From the inscription (No. 189-T.T.) we learn that in addition to the above two Brahmotsavams observed in the 10th century one such festival was established in the month of Adi by about 1300 A.D. Coming to Vijayanagar times we find that Harihara II instituted another such festival in the month of Masi. As time advanced, we learn that before the middle of the 16th century, they became ten, distributed among ten months with the exception of Vaikasi and Ani. For performing Brahmotsavam Dhvaja- Stambha and Balipitha are necessary. So both must have existed from very early times, from the 10th century onwards, if not earlier. First they must have been in the inner Prakara when the temple was small. When Tirumamani Mandapa was constructed, both must have got shifted to the present location to suit the festivals and endowments that got multiplied demanding more space and elaborate arrangements. 

(d) Tirumalaraya Mandapa. 

Its finely carved high pillars with warriors riding on horses etc., remind one of similar mandapas at Srirangam, Madurai and Sriperumbudur. They 

244 

SEVEN PHASES IN THE CONSTRUCITON OF THE TIRUMALA TEMPLE 

are all late Vijayanagar types. This Mandapa is said to have been constructed by Saluva Narasimha in the middle of the 15th century for celebrating the Anna Unjal Tirunal instituted by him in the year 1473 A.D. The structure was subsequently extended in the 16th century by Srirangaraja Tirumalaraja. This is confirmed by the presence of heavy complex pillars with very elaborate floral designs on them supporting high terrace and placed on high basement, a common feature in post-Vijayanagar period. 

(e) Four small mandapas at four corners. 

The simple four-pillared mandapas at the four corners were constructed by Saluva Narasimha (1470 A.D.) in his name and in the name of his wife and two sons. 

(ƒ) Pratima mandapa. 

In this mandapa we see a number of statues including that of Sri Krishna- devaraya with his two queens. It is a simple sixteen-pillared mandapa. It is modern. Elsewhere we find that such mandapas were erected only after 16th century when festivals became numerous and attracted huge crowd. 

(g) Ranga mandapa. 

This seems to be the earliest mandapa in this prakara. There is an abandoned shrine inside this big mandapa. It is believed that during the time of muslim invasion of the South, 1310-1360, the utsava deity of Srirangam was brought and temporarily installed in the shrine. It is said to have been constructed by Sriranganatha Yadavaraya, the local ruler, to accommodate Sri Ranganatha in the small shrine and the refugees who followed Him, in the spacious mandapa. Its high basement, massive single pillars with heavy capitals place it in early Vijayanagar period. 

(h) Outer Gopura. 

On its vyala-vari, in three places we see prominently the Pandyan emblem. The stambhas and the kodungai are in late Chola style with pushpa bodhikai and kudu with yali head. We have no inscription giving its exact date of construction. The earliest inscription on it is of the time of Yadavaraya Viranarasimha, 1217 A.D. Chronologically, the next inscription is dated 1260 A.D. But the most interesting one, though fragmentary, is the one in the first tier which refers to Sundara Pandya, 1251-1275. Hence, it can be 

245 

THE TIRUMALA TEMPLE 

said that during the time of Sundara Pandya, it must have been renovated completely. The presence of the Ranga Mandapa having the two outer madil walls for its two sides points out that the outer madil must have existed prior to 1320 A.D. Later, we learn that Saluva Narasimha endowed the village of Durgasamudram for the purpose of constructing and repairing gopuras in about the year 1472-1482. So, at this time this gopura, as we see now, must have come out full-fledged. 

(xii) Seven steps of temple construction. 

An examination of the epigraphical evidence shows that very many Chola rulers constructed or repaired extensive portions of the Tirumala temple. The Pandya Kings and the Bhallalas placed their entire royal treasury at the feet of the Lord. The Vijayanagar emperors who were great devotees, made extensive donations to Lord Venkatesvara. The Matli family who ruled these parts as late as the 18th century also contributed to the glory of the temple. 

Architectually speaking, the Tirumala temple would appear to have been developed in the following seven phases:---- 

(a) A standing murthi in an open mandapa from very early days perhaps 

from the first or second century A.D. 

(b) A small garbhagriha and ardha mandapa built between the days of Tirumalisai Alvar and Kula Sekhar Alvar since the former speaks of the Lord being visible from all the sides and the latter speaks of a padi or step in which he prays to be born again and again, and a padi is impossible without an enclosing structure. 

(c) (i) A regular temple with the garbhagriha and ardha mandapa at the time of Samavai, the Pallava queen, since she consecrated the utsava murthi. 

(ii) The garbhagriha, Sayanamandapa and the Mukkoti Pradakshina with the Ramar medai portion being open in existence by about 9th or 10th centuries A.D. when perhaps the temple was known as Kovil Alvar. 

(ii) The existence of the Saapana mandapa in the 10th century A.D. when the temple was known as Tiruvilan Kovil. 

246 

SEVEN PHASES IN THE CONSTRUCTION Of the tirumALA TEMPLE 

(d) Extensive renovation during the time of Yadavaraya of 13th century ,when both he and the Pandyan kings gold plated the vimana. At this stage or in an earlier stage the walls of the garbhagriha were widened and the vimana was built and gold gilded. 

(e) Closure of the Ramar medai perhaps as a measure of safety or more probably to prevent the Pancharatra type of worship being performed at any time in the temple. 

(ƒ) The construction of Tirumamani mandapa is, in 1417 A.D. by Madhavadasa, 

(g) The modern Garuda shrine and the other mandapas in the architecture of the late Vijayanagar period. 

Thus from a standing Lord with an open mandapą to a small closed structure, to extensive renovations by Yadavaraya and construction and gold plating of the vimanam by him and Pandyas, and through further and extensive mandapas being built in Vijayanagara days, the temple has grown enormously in popularity and sanctity. 

But the architectural development has not grown on any pre-arranged or pre-chalked out plan but took place according to the choice of the donors and according to the circumstances prevailing in each century. 

There is one peculiar feature in the modern Tirumala temple. In the present Aina Mahal where the Unjal utsavam is done, there is no inscriptions to show the name of the mandapa or the donor or the purpose for which it was originally built. All other mandapas could be dated either by the donor or the purpose for which they were constructed. From architectural features, it would appear that this was in the nature of a Yagasala originally but at present it has been converted to an Unjal mandapa. 

(xiii) Summary of Conclusions. 

To conclude, the Šri Venkatēšvara temple at Tirupati has a hoary antiquity. Šiļappadikāram of 3rd-4th-7th century A.D., refers to the standing figure of Vishnu on the high hill in the Vengadam hill range. The type of structure in which the image is enshrined is not however mentioned. Probably it was a free standing image mounted on a base in a ŝilä prākāra similar to Šankarshana Väsudēva of Nagari in Rajasthan. Subsequently it must have been enshrined in a garbhagriha with an entrance and a door step as we find mentioned in Tirumangai-Alvår hymns sung in praise of Lord Venkatesvara at Tiruvēngadam 

247 

THE TIRUMALA TEMPLE 

$ 

It is quite likely that this shrine was on plan a rectangular shrine of seven feet with either a šālakāra ŝikhara or an ēkatala-vimāna. 

The present central shrine on plan now consists of a mukha-maṇḍapa- Rāmar-mēdai, sayana-maṇḍapa, antarāļa and garbhagṛiha. The adhisthāna consists of the mouldings, upāna, kampa, padma, jagati, kampa, fluted kumuda, kantha with galapadas, kapota and vēdika. The näsika decoration on the kapota and the adhisṭhāna mouldings are beautifully carved. 

The bhitti has closely spaced pilasters, dēvakōshļas and kumbha-pañjaras. The pilasters have square bases and the shaft is either of octagonal or circular variety. Tall lasuna, tadi, kumbha, padma and phalaka-the crowning parts of the pilaster are well separated and sharply chiselled. The pushpa bodhika capital is noteworthy. The kumbha pañjara in its form is developed. The fluted kumbha at the base, the highly faceted shrine model above, and the over- flowing flowery patterns from the vase, are exquisitely carved. The prastara in its valabhi moulding carries haṁsamāla. The kapota is a highly projected and overhanging one. Its underside is decorated with rafters and drops recalling wood work. 

These features present a fully developed architectural decoration-meant to be seen and enjoyed by the visitors to the shrine, and not to be kept closed from their eyes. This has been closed from the view of the visitor by some at a later date who constructed a pillared mandapa-and a plain screen wall all around. These pillars longitudinally to the shrine covering garbhagṛiha sayana mandapa and Rāmar-Mɛdai. On the left side as we go into the shrine there is only one row of pillars while on the right there are two rows of pillars. These are erected on a raised platform which runs around the temple structure. The original drain that took away the rain water and the cistern in which the abhishēka water is collected was allowed to remain in their original position. The pillars are circular in section and have corbels with tenon and are typical of the Chōla phase. The ceiling is made of slabs covering the part of the eves of the shrine complex. 

The epigraphical evidence available at Tirupati and elsewhere provides us with an interesting piece of  data about the development of this shrine complex. The history of this shrine between c. 600-1200 A. D. is not clear. The Tiruchänür inscription (219-G.T.) of Dantivarman Pallava in 51st regnal year registers the benefactions to Tiruchānür temple and also refers to the temple of the Vengadam hill. Another inscription dated in the 14th year of Köppătra- Mahendrapanmar, refers to a gift made by one Sāmavai alias Kādavaṇ Perundēvi, daughter of Pallavappërkaḍaiyär and queen of Sattivitañkaņ alias

SEVEN PHASES IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE TIRUMALA TEMPLE 

Ŝri Kādupattigal to the god Perumāņaḍiga) who was pleased to be at Sri Venkadam. This prince has been identified with the Kō-Pārthivëndravarman, : contemporary of Parântaka II Sundarachõļa (c.A.D. 956–970). Scholars are divided about the identification of the above Köppätra Mahendravarman. While one set of scholars identify him with Ko Parthivēndravarman, the present author on the basis of imperial titles given to him, is inclined to identify him with Mahendravarman Pallava (600-630 A.D.) son of Simhavishnu. If this identification is accepted it establishes the existence of the shrine during the period of the imperial pallavas. An important epigraph in the history of Tirumala temple belongs to the time of Vira Narasingadēva Yādavarāya. The main shrine of Ŝri Venkatēšvara's temple was renovated in the 40th regnal year of Vira Narasinga Yadavarāya (A.D. 1245) and all the earlier inscriptions on the temple walls were re-engraved on the north wall after the repairs. 

Probably the garbhagṛiha, antarāla, sayana-maṇḍapa were built during this period. The garbhagṛiha was enlarged which externally now measures about 24 ft. The enlarged fabric was needed to construct the ānanda vimäna which now stands on the garbhagriha. In the subsequent periods when Vijayanagar rose to prominence in South India, the shrine received regular and large scale benefactions. Numerous structures were added to suit the needs of the age. Two successive pradakshinas were provided. 

Today there is a closed passage which runs around the sanctum called as vaikuntha pradakshṇa which is kept open only on vaikuṇṭha ēkādaši day in the year. Who was the author of this addition to the temple complex. When did he do it, and why did he do it. Since the garbhagṛiha with all the artistic embellishments was intended to be open for view it could not be the work of Yadavarayas who enlarged and improved the shrine. Since we find inscriptions of Krishṇa Rāya on the outer wall of the mukha maṇḍupa— which are partly covered by the Vaikuņţha pradakshiņa the same must post date the Krishṇaraya's reign. To the present author it appears to be the work of influential important Vaishnava Āchāryas during the post-Krishṇa Rāyas period particularly under Achyuta and Sadāŝiva who favoured Vaishnavism. During this period Vaishnavism became the dominant creed and influence of Tätä- charyas was at its highest. It is quite likely that in order to highlight the supremacy of Vishņu for whom the Vaikuntha Ēkādasi is the most sacrep parvadina they might have introduced this new custom of allowing the pilgrims in the inner circuit of Vaikuntha-pradakshiņa by enclosing the Sanctum with a plain wall.
