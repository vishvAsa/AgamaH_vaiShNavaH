TIRUMALA IN LITERATURE AND SONG


## Section I: Tamil Literature. 


### (i) General. 

The shrine of Lord Sri Venkatesvara on the Tirumala Hills is generally known as Vengadam or Triuvengadam (Tiru-beautiful) and the Lord Sri Venkatesvara as 'Vengadathan' or 'Tiruvengadathan.' From the earliest days of Tamil Literature up to the present day Vengadam and its Lord occupy a prominent place in Tamil literary works and His praises are sung. Further, the Tirupati Hills formed a land-mark in the topography of South India and are mentioned as the limit upto which Tamil was spoken, the place where all cultural streams of India met. 


### (ii) Academic period. 

Tolkappiam, the earliest complete Tamil work extant, whose date is considered by scholars to be anterior to Panini, the Sanskrit grammarian, gives the extent to which Tamil is spoken as:~ 

வடவேங்கடந் தென்குமரி யாயிடைத் 

தமிழ் கூறு நல்லகம். 

"The good land of the Tamil language which lies between the northern Vengadam and the Southern Kumari (Cape Comorin).” 

This shows that Tirumala is known to South India from the earliest days of the Christian era. 

201 


### (iii) Classic period. 

In the classic period of Tamil Literature when the Sangam works like Pathupattu and Purananuru and the great epics like Silappathikaram and Manimegalai were composed, we find mention of Vengadam in the epic Silappathikaram. This work is generally attributed to the second century A.D., and is considered slightly posterior to Sangam works. Some scholars conclude from chronological evidence that this epic should have been composed in the eighth century A.D. Be that as it may, we find the Tirupati Hills distinctly called as நெடியோன் குன்றம் (Vishnu's Hill) in this epic and its Lord is sung thus:- 

வீங்குநீ ரருவி வேங்கட மென்னு மோங்கயர் மலையத் துச்சி மீமிசை விரிகதிர் ஞாயிறுந் திங்களும் விளங்கி யிருமருங் கோங்கிய விடைநிலைத் தானத்து மின்னுக்கோடி யுடுத்து விளங்குவிற் பூண்டு நன்னிற மேக நின்றது போலப் 

பகையணங் காழியும் பால்வெண் சங்கமுந் தகைபெறு தாமரைக் கையி னேந்தி  \
நலங்கிள ரார மார்பிற் பூண்டு  \
பொலம் பூ வாடையிற் பொலிந்து தோன்றிய  \
செங்க ணெடியோ னிந்த வண்ணமும். 

(Silappathikaram, Kadukankathaï, 41-51.) 

"(On the summit of the Vengadam decked with torrents on either side and radiant with the effulgent rays, as it were, of the sun and the moon, Lord Vishnu (நெடியோன்) of lotus eyes is in a standing posture adorned with brilliant cloth of gold round his loins and a beautiful garland on His breast bearing in His lotus-like palms, His invincible discus and milk-white conch. He is like a black cloud with lightning and rain-bow). " 

Srirangam, Tirupati and Tirumalkunram are the three other great shrines described in this book and Vengadam has been given more space than the other two. 

This also proves that Tirumala was considered to be a holy place during the centuries of the classic period. 

202 


### (iv) Hymnal period. 

From the classic period we pass on to the hymnal period of Tamil Literature when hymns like Nalayira Prabandham and Thevaram were sung by the Vaishnavite Alvars and Saivite Nayanmars. Vengadam and its Lord find numerous references in the work of Nalayira Prabandham which is a collection of four thousand hymns sung by the famous twelve Vaishnavite Alvars of South India in praise of Vishnu and His Avatars. Of the twelve Alvars only two Mathura-kavi and Tondaradipodi have not sung of Tirupati. The hymns of the remaining ten Alvars have reference to Venkadam and its Lord. 

Poigai Alvar, Pudattu Alvar and Peyalvar, are the three Alvars who were born in Tondai Nadu, the country adjacent to Tirupati including the present districts of North Arcot and Chingleput, and are believed to have been contemporaneous. Their dates cannot be fixed with any degree of accuracy but considering that they are called முதலாழ்வார்கள் the first Alvars, and from internal evidence of their hymns, we will not be far from historical truth if we put them to about seventh century A.D. Each of these Alvars has contributed one hundred stanzas to the Nalayira Prabandham and Poigai Alvar mentions Vengadam in nine out of his one hundred stanzas. Vengadam is considered to be one of the four great shrines by this Alvar, the other three being Vinnagaram, Venka and Koval. According to this Alvar it is Vengadam that enlightens the gods, it is Vengadam that learned brahmins worship and its Lord is the Lord of the four Vedas. 

Puthattu Alvar has eight stanzas on Vengadam in his century of verses in the Nalayira Prabandham. This Alvar says that Vengadam is the highest object to be desired and the Lord of Vengadam is the Lord of the Vedas, the God of gods. 

Peyalvar's contributions of Vengadam are as many as fifteen stanzas and the word 'Tirumalai ' is used for the first time by this Alvar in his stanzas 63 and 75. 

This Alvar says that the sanctity of Vengadam is equal to if not more than that of Vaikuntha ' and Parkadal (Ocean of Milk). Lord of Vengadam is described as the Supreme Lord thus:- 

இறையாய் நிலனாகி எண்திசையும் தானாய்  \
மறையாய் மறைப்பொருளாய்வானாய் - பிறைவாய்ந்த வெள்ளத்தருவி விளங்கொலிநீர் வேங்கடத்தான் 

1. ST 6T Á Ôg, er Gerr 2.er sir. 

(Peyalvar, Iyarpah 39). 

"(Vengadathan who lives on the Hill where a number of streams of sparkling water flow in a meandering course as the first phase of the moon is the Lord, He is the universe, He is the eight cardinal points, He is the four Vedas and their essence, He is the being that is seated in the heart of all beings)." 

Thirumalisai Alvar who can be safely placed chronologically immediately after these Alvars has sung Lord Venkatesvara in both his poems Tiruchanda Viruttam and Nanmugan Tiruvandadi. The high veneration in which Vengadam was held in those days can be learnt from the following hymn:- 

வேங்கடமே விண்ணோர் தொழுவதும் மெய்ம்மையால் வேங்கடமே மெய்வினை நோய்தீர்ப்பதுவும் -- வேங்கடமே தானவரை வீழத் தன்னாழிப் படை தொட்டு 

வானவரைக் காப்பாள் மலை. 

(Nanmugan Tiruvandadi, 48) 

"(It is Vengadam that Devas worship. In truth it is Vengadam that frees us from all sins and diseases. Vengadam is the mountain of our Lord who has defeated the Danavas with his discus and saved the Devas)." 

Tiruppanalvar has also been sung of the Lord though he has contributed only a hymn of ten stanzas (my co ou oog ogs) to the Nalayira- prabandham. Vengadam and Srirangam are the only two shrines celebrated by this Alvar in his hymns. 

Tirumangai Alvar, one of the most learned of the alvars, is one who has contributed the greatest number of stanzas to the Nalayiram. He has as many as 64 stanzas in honour of Vengadam and its Lord. He has recorded the military achievements of Nandivarman Pallavamalla in his hymns, who lived in 8th Century A.D. Therefore, Tirumangai Alvar must have flourished in the middle of the eighth century A.D. This Alvar's hymn headed ‘gr@wsjme 6)wṁ pó' expresses the highest philosophical truth and in this the Lord is requested in all earnestness to save the Alvar from this worldly bondage. To translate the stanza:- 

"(Till now I was fed up with the thoughts of my mother, father, wife, children and relatives. Oh! Lord of Vengadam, covered with beautiful gardens 

204 

TIRUMALA IN LITERATURE AND SONG 

full of flowers, I have come to you being animated with the desire of seeing you. Pray, accept me and shower divine grace on me).” 

↓ 

Kulasekara Alvar, the royal saint, has contributed 105 stanzas to the Nalayiram of which eleven are on Tiruvengadam. This alvar is also said to have lived round about 9th Century A.D. His poem on Vengadam headed eerGorgy' is exceedingly moving and of a very high literary merit. Here the Alvar expresses his desire to be born on Tirupati Hills as a bird or a beast, a fish or a tree, or be a stream or stone, a post or a statue in preference to all earthly riches and kingdoms, Lord Vengadavan is venerated as one who could free human beings from all sins; to be at least a step on the sacred hills is devoutly prayed for thus:- 

"Oh! Tirumal who is capable of freeing me from all sins, Universal Lord, Lord of Vengadam! I would like to be feasting at the sight of your coral-like lips even if I could get the form of a stone-step in front of your temple at whose doors your devotees, gods and celestial nymphs crowd to worship you". 

Periyalvar, a native of Srivilliputtur, in the extreme south of the peninsula has celebrated sixteen Vaishnavite shrines in his contribution of 473 stanzas to the Nalayira Prabandham and Vengadam is one of the shrines. The age of this Alvar is not definitely known but from the style of his poems and the use of a large number of Sanskrit words we can take him to be later in time than Tirumangai Alvar. Lord of Vengadam is the truth of the Vedas and by Him this Alvar has been freed from all sins and has attained the Supreme Bliss. 

Andal, the only lady Vaishnavite saint, who is reputed to be the daughter of Periyalvar, has sixteen stanzas on Vengadam in her total contribution of 173 stanzas to the 4000. Her poem on Vengadam headed விண்ணில் wrùyCo' is in the form of an address to the cloud asking it to be her messenger to convey to the Lord of Vengadam her deep love and reverence for Him and her request to have her wedded to Him. Here is a reminiscence of Kalidasa's Meghaduta. 

Nammalvar, another saint of Pandiya nadu, whose contributions to the Nalayiram are copious and next only to those of Tirumangai Alvar has sung the praises of Vengadam and its Lord in as many as fifty-four stanzas. Though :ccording to the orthodox tradition this Alvar flourished in the beginning of Kaliyuga (3102 B.C.). still it is believed that this Alvar should have flourished in the first half of the tenth century A.D. The Lord of Vengada is described as, 

205

THE TIRUMALA TEMPLE 

*#godis' (Supreme Lord) and the hill as one that will give Moksha ̧ It is also significant that it is only this Alvar who addresses the Lord of Vengadam as the Lord of Alarmelmangai (அலர்மேல்மங்கையுறை மார்பா) Probably the temple at Thiruchanoor, near Tirupati, attained prominence somewhere about this period. 

(v) Epic period. 

From the hymnal age we enter the epic period of Tamil literature. The outstanding work of this period is Kamba Ramayanam. According to orthodox tradition Kamba Ramayanam was completed in the year 885 A.D. (Salivahana Saka 807). But there is a good deal of literary evidence to show that Kamba- nattalvar was a contemporary of the Chola king, Kulottunga II and of Prataparudra 1 of Warangal. From epigraphic evidence the date of these kings is fixed in the twelfth century A.D. Hence, present-day scholars consider that Kamba Ramayanam also would have been composed in the twelfth century A.D. Vengadam and its sanctity are described in Kamba Ramayanam, Kishkindha Kandam, ‘Nadavitta Padalam,' stanzas 26, 27 and 28 thus ;---- 

"(Commanding his armies under different leaders to proceed in different directions in search of Sita, Sugriva says to Hanuman You will reach the cool Vengada Hill which is overgrown with forests full of bee-hives, which limits the boundary between the northern and the southern language, which contains the Truth enshrined in the Four Vedas and all the Sastras, which is the abode of all good deeds and which stands out as the eternal Satya. We have to worship the holy men that are on the Vengada hills even from here, holy men who do good deeds without any idea of reward, who have freed themselves from all Karma both good and bad, who look on riches and poverty alike and who have attained the highest bliss. The sacred Vengada Hill contains many rivers where a number of true brahmins bathe and has many Asramas where live a number of holy men of great tapas and of deep knowledge of the Vedas and hoary Sastras; cloud-topped slopes of the hill abound in precious stones and on this hill all animals, naturally inimical, sleep together forgetting their feuds, lured to sleep by the sweet music of Kinnara Vadya of the fair celestial maidens.)" 

It may be mentioned that in the corresponding place in the Ramayana of Valmiki, Venkatachala does not find any reference at all. 

The foregoing extracts from the Tamil classics will give a general idea of the nature of the Deity on the Vengadam Hills and the hoary sanctity attached 

206 

TIRUMALA IN LITERATURE AND SONG 

to them. Veneration has been bestowed on the hill and its Lord from the dawn of History. 

SECTION II: SANSKRIT LITERATURE. 

Vishvagunadarsa Champu. 

This is a champu kavya in Sanskrit composed by Venkatadhvari son of Raghunatha dikshita and Sitamba. He was a native of Kanchi. This book is a champu written in a form of dialogue between two gandharvas Krisanu and Vishvavasu. The theme of the book is about different sacred temples and places in the country from Badari to Setu. The theme is developed by a novel technique by which Krisanu criticises every person and kshetra and Vishvavasu answers them thus presenting before the reader all aspects of the subject. 

During the course of their pilgrimage from Badari to Setu they are said to have visited Seshachala and the Tirumala temple and there is a section in this kavya which refers to the temple and its practices, 

Vishvavasu enjoins upon his colleague Krisanu to pray and surrender to the Lord and gives an account of the praises of Venkatachala who is a resident of the sacred hill, as the Lord of Lakshmi who showers grace on all her devotees. Vishvavasu, carries his description of the Tirumala temple, by saying that Lord Vishnu found the temple to be a better place to reside than Vaikunta and therefore left it and took his permanent abode here in this hill with Lakshmi. The Lord is praised by him as the essence of all vedas, who is nearest to the heart of the devotees, and an incarnation of Lord Krishna of the dynasty of Yadavas. 

Krisanu retorts to the above adulation that the Lord is an usurer, who extorts with full interest, all the donations promised by a devotee, to avert any disaster, and that the Lord once sought some one in the forest for a few drops of water to quench his thirst and carried earth when somebody was digging a tank. Krisanu feels that such a person should not be praised by the men learned in the Vedas. 

In reply to this so-called criticism Visvavasu gives a graphic description of the great qualities of the Lord. He again praises the Lord and compares him to Lord Krishna who gave immense riches to Kuchela in exchange for a handful of beaten rice. The hill is said to resemble Srirama and this hill 

207 

THE TIRUMALA TEMPLE 

is also said to have several caves or guhas even as Lord Rama had a guba as a follower. Just as Rama was the source of the solar race, this hill was the source of the growth of the brilliant bamboos and like Rama being surrounded by his brothers, this hill is also surrounded by peaks. The Seshachala hill is said to contain hillocks, the word 'pada ' used here having double meaning viz. both feet and hillocks. 

In this way this Champu gives a graphic description of the temple and the Lord as it was known in the 16th Century. 

SECTION III: TELUGU LITERATURE. 

(i) Krishnadevaraya. 

Krishnadevaraya of the great Vijayanagar empire makes a reference of Lord Venkatesvara in his work "Amuktamalyada." He was a great devotee of Lord Venkatesvara and visited Tirumala temple as much as seven times, and paid his respects to the Lord and presented invaluable jewellery and ornaments. He was also responsible for granting 30,000 varahas of gold for plating the Ananda Divya Vimana over the Garbhagriha of the Lord. Sri Krishnadevaraya is popularly known as "Sri Venkatagiri Vallabha Seva Paratantra Raya." His great work Amuktamalyada" was composed in 1516 A.D. while the emperor was camping at Vijayawada enroute to Srikakulam when Andhra Jalajaksha appeared in a dream to him, and directed him to compose a work to be dedicated to Lord Venkatesvara who is identical with Andhra Jalajaksha himself. The word * Amuktamalyada" means offering a garland of flowers to the Lord after wearing it oneself which is found in the legends of that great Vaishnavite saint Andal, also called as Sudi Koduththa Nachchiyar." 

66 

The book deals with the lives of Godadevi or Andal and her foster-father Vishnuchitta. This is a book which is full of the episodes of saints and other legends found in the Puranas and expounds the basic philosophy of Vishistadvaita. This book is dedicated to Lord Venkatesvara of Tirumala and contains much information about the contemporary beliefs and practices of Sri Vaishnavites of that period. 

56 

(ii) Chayapati. 

Chintalapalli Chayapati was another author who dedicated his Telugu Raghavabhyudayamu to Lord Venkatesvara. 

The author belonged to a family of scholars and poets of the Devarakonda Velama Court, and at the invitation of Venkata Reddy of Boravelli wrote the poem dedicated to Lord Venkatesvara. He was a Telangana poet of the 18th Century who wrote at the instance of the Rajas of Boravelli which later got merged in the Gadwal Samsthanam of Old Nizam's State. 

Sri Venkatesvara Laghu Kritulu. 

The Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams Oriental Institute has compiled 19 Satakams and Stavams in praise for Lord Venkatesvara, from the manuscripts in its possession. These were edited by Veturi Prabhakara Sastry. A few of them are noted below:- 

(a) Venkatachala Vihara Satakam. 

This work describes graphically the misery of the people during the general massacre and pillage of Tirupati and Tirumala by the Muslim armies of the Nawab of Golconda in the 3rd quarter of the 17th Century. 

(b) Venkatachala dhama Taravali. 

This is perhaps a nindastuti which expresses regrets that Venkatesa the Lord of the universe should eat food made of unpounded rice and should stretch out his hands to receive even an uncurrent coin when Lakshmi the goddess of wealth shines on his chest. The poet expresses his innate devotion by obliquely referring to the practices of the temple. 

(c) Pankajata Bhavandesa Satakam. 

This manuscript describes the ten Avataras of Lord Venkatesa and concludes by saying that he would appear again as Kalki at the end of Kaliyuga. This makes a reference also to the Lord's Kirita, Kundala, Kaustubha, Ratnahara and permanent residence of Goddess Alamelumanga on his chest. 

(d) The Venkatesvara Panchaka. 

In this there is a reference to the upright Namam of the Lord. There is a unique reference in this work to the black hair of the Lord. 

(e) Venkatachalapati Satakam. 

The author states here that he had a vision of the Lord's Shankha and Chakra and tasted the Pulukapu Tirtha and prasada. The author gives poetic expression in this work to his total surrender to the grace of the Lord.

(f) Venkata-Nagadhyaksha-Satakanı. 

This is also a collection of verses and complains that the Lord is bereft of all mercy and is very busy in the collection of kasus from villagers and hence apparently has no time to respond to the call of the devotees. The poet gives expression to his inner expression that the spot of the temple is Vaikunta itself and ends with a graphic description of the Shankha and Chakra of the Lord and describes the holy feet of the Lord as radiating animadi asta- siddhis. 

(g) Sri Venkatesvara Kalyana, 

This is a reference to the Puranic story of Bhrigu Maharishi where the Rishi is supposed to kick the three murtis Siva, Vishnu, and Brahma with his right foot, to find out who is supreme. Sri Lakshmi resided in the chest of Lord Vishnu and on experiencing the kick, she ran away to Kollapuram and on Vishnu's beseeching her, promised to join him at Venkatagiri after proceeding to the lotus pond at Tiruchanur where she was known as Alamelumanga. 

Venkamamba's Works. 

The author Venkamamba had intense devotion to Lord Venkatesvara and on being forced to matrimony by her father, she forsook family life and devoted herself entirely to the service of the Lord. The author notes her father's name as Kanala Krishnayya and mother as Mangamba of Vashishta gotra belonging to Nandavara community. Her husband was Injeti Venka- chalapati and hence her surname came to be Injeti. 

The author probably lived in the second half of the 18th Century and the first half of the 19th Century. She took to intense yoga and practiced meditation in "Tumburukona" amidst the thick forest about ten miles to the north of the Tirumala temple. It is generally believed that she had visions of the Lord. Her Samadhi still stands in a garden on the north side of the north street in Tirumala. She offered a mutyala hara in a silver plate embedded with pearls in the form of one of the dasavataras each night to Bhoga Srinivasa Murti. This is referred to in the Kankairya Patti prepared by the English East India Company in Fasli 1230 or 1890 A.D. 

She composed the following works on the Lord. 


#### Matrusri Tarigonda Venkamamba Kritulu. 

(a) Satakamulu: 

(i) Tarkonda Nrisimha Satakamu.  \
	(ii) Srikrishnamanjari (Krishna Satakamu).

A few are noted below: 

(a) Sri Rama Parinayamu 

This is a dvipada kavya by Venkamamba describing the marriage of Lord Venkatesa and Lakshmidevi interspersed with local episodes. 

(b) Sri Krishna Manjari 

This contains 137 couplets by Venkamamba and begins each one with an invocation of Lord Venkatesa whom she considers to be an incarnation of Lord Krishna. The author says a perusal of this poem is equal to chanting the name of Krishna. This is a simple, lucid and pleasing work, and mentions that Lord Krishna taught her the supreme principle of utter surrender of her Atma to the Lord without bothering anything about other dharmas etc. 

211 

THE TIRUMALA TEMPLE 

(v) Yerra Pragada Kavi 

This author lived in the 14th Century and was known as Shambhudasa and Prabandha Parmesvara 

19 

He completed the unfinished portion of Aranya parva of the famous Telugu Mahabharata which was composed by Nannaya Bhatta and Tikkana Somayaji. He composed "Narasimha purana 

dedicated to Lord Nara- simhaswamy of Ahobilam. In the last few stanzas of this work, the poet states that Sankhyas, Yogis, Saivas and Pancharatras and others worship the same Narasimhaswamy in different forms and names. In one of his verses he makes a reference to Lord Venkatapati and makes a complete surrender of his soul to the Lord of the universe. 

(vi) Chadalavada Mallayya kavi 

In his 50th stanza of the 3rd canto of his “Vipra Narayana Charitra " the poet describes the rising sun as the absolute Brahma which different people worship in different forms. In this also there is implicit reference to Lord Venkatachalapati. 

(vii) Tallapaka Annamacharya 

This famous composer who is credited with having composed nearly 32,000 Sakirtanams to Lord Venkatesvara has also written a book called "Venkatesvara Sataka." This is an interesting book depicting the episodes pertaining to the Consort of the Lord namely Goddess Alamelumanga. 

He closes the work with a fervent prayer that he the poet is an unfortunate person, leading a hard life and seeking refuge at the holy feet of Goddess Alamelumanga, and that he yearns for her merciful looks, and worships her with the full bloomed fowers of words. 

(viii) Pedda Tirumalachary: 

Pedda Tirumalacharya the son of Annamacharya translated into easy Telugu verses in dvipada metre the suprabhata and designated it as 

** Sri Venkateswara Prabhata Stava." This is intended to awake the Lord in the morning and to receive the adoration of his devotees. The Lord is said to have lived in the reigns of the Vijayanagara king Krishnadevaraya, Achyuta- raya and Sadasiva Raya. A peculiar and unique remark is made in this work that Krishnadevaraya did not evince any special favours towards the Lord but that Achyutaraya and Sadasivaraya patronised Him and granted Him villages etc. 

212 

TIRUMALA IN LITERATURE AND SONG 

(ix) Revamuri Venkatarya: 

Annamacharya has by his second wife Akkamba a daughter by name Tirumalamba, who married Revanuri Tirumala Kondaraya. Their son was Revanuri Venkatarya who lived in the 16th Century and wrote the Telugu poem called "Sripada Renu Mahatmya' In this work the author praises the divine qualities of the Sripadarenu and entreats the Lord to bless him always with the renu so that he may get divine inspiration for his poetry. The Lord is said to have taken the form of Dhanavantri to cure diseases and the poet attributes to the Sripadarenu the power of curing dumbness, deafness, ignorance and stammering. The poet describes it as an efficient cause in all the avataras of Lord Vishnu and states that the Sripadarenu was the source of the great success of Annamacharya otherwise known as “ Sankirtanacharya.” 

"" 

(x) Kakamani Murtikavi: 

This poet who lived in the 16th Century dedicated his work “ Rajavahana Vijaya to Lord Venkatesvara. In dedication the poet euphemistically says that he is marrying his Kavya Kanya to Archavatava of the Lord of Venkatachala, and in the course of this description, praises the Lord in exquisite verse as Timmappa a shortened form for Tirumala Appa. An interesting statement in this work is that pilgrims from Kataka, Kalyana, and Delhi regions resort to Tirumala for Brahmotsavam of Venkatesvara. He concludes his work with a fervent prayer that there is no other god as magnanimous as Venkatesa the Lord of Seshachala in bestowing gifts on all his devotees. 

(xi) Siddhiraju Timmaraju: 

Siddhiraju Timmaraju was the governor of Kondavidu. He was a nephew of Aliya Ramaraya of the Aravidu dynasty. He composed a poem “ Parmayogi vilasa" and dedicated it to the Lord of Mangalagiri. In a sisamalika metre stanza, he refers to Lord Venkatesvara's tranquil pose, his left hand resting on his hip, his golden ornament, his right varadahasta pointing to his feet as the sole refuge of the afflicted, his merciful looks, his strings of pearls and his lustrous Tirita, Shankha and Chakra. 

(xii) Tarigoppula Mallan: 

This poet, a native of Chandragiri, wrote the poem ‘Chandrabhanu Charitam,' in which he describes the journey of crores of pilgrims who came to worship Venkatesa with cheeks pierced with wire, locking their mouth, 

213 

THE TIRUMALA TEMPLE 

and rolling their bodies on the floor in angapradakshina. He gives a graphic description of the Govindaraja temple and the difficulties of the pilgrims who ascend the hills with great difficulty. 

(xiii) Pingali Suranarya: 

He was a protege of Krishnaraja of Nandyala. In the second canto of his work Manikandhara," the disciple of Narada said to have made an intensive pilgrimage and reached Venkatesvara temple at the end. He then gives a graphic description of the temple as it must have looked in the 16th Century when the poet composed his work. After spending three days and nights on the Venkata hill, the pilgrim described his descent down the hills and his going to Kanchi. 

(xiv) Sreshtaluri Venkatarya: 

This poet has written a Telugu kavya in dvipada metre entitled “Srinivasa Vilasa Sevadhi." A condensation of this was published by the T.T.D. in 1954. 

In this work the list of the nine tirthas in the Swamy Pushkarini is given as follows:-- 

(a) Varaha tirtham at the north west corner. 

(b) Kubera (dhanada) tirtham on the north side.

Tallapaka Annamacharya was the earliest known musician who composed songs in praise of Lord Venkatesvara. His grand-son has written that his grand-father had composed upwards of 32,000 sankirtanas. In the 1920s from a small cell sealed with loose stones in the Vimana pradakshina of the Tirumala temple about 2590 copper plates were recovered each having three sankirtanas engraved on either side. The rest of the Sankirtanams are lost. Some are said to be in Ahobila Narasimha Swamy temple and some in Srirangam temple but they have not been traced up to now. 

He was a Telugu Nandavara born in 1408 A.D. and lived up to a ripe old age till 1503 A.D. Annamacharya's songs on Lord Venkatesa are so well known that they need no elaborate description.

TIRUMALA IN LITERATURE AND SONG 

He lived in the early years of the 16th Century. According to tradition Purandaradasa is said to have come to Tirumala on hearing the fame of Annamacharya. Tradition has it that on the occasion of their meeting each other, they jointly composed a song which, though, it is the same song, is differently addressed to the respective deities of the composers, with Trivenkata- nayaka being invoked by Annamacharya and Purandaradasa invoking Lord Vithala by prefixing his own name to the name of the god as his special ensign of the authorship of the song. 

During this visit, Purandaradasa is said to have composed some poems in honour of Lord Venkatesa some of which are as follows:- 

(a) “Kande Kande Svamiya bedi konde," in which he praises Lord Venkatesvara as resplendent like a crore of suns. This song is in Mukhari raga and Madhyatala.

(c) In a third song in Navaroj raga and Adi tala entitled Nambide Ninna padava Venkataramana nambide nina padava," he prayed to Lord Venkatesa as the lifter of the Mandara hill, and requested him to lead him (the devotee) in the right path since the devotee had totally trusted only the lotus feet of the Lord.
