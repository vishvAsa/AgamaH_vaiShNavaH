THE EPIGRAPHS OF TIRUMALA TEMPLE. 


## I. Introduction. 

Tirumala temple like others in our country bears on its walls several epigraphs of various kings, queens, generals, other royal benefactors and common men who made gifts and endowments to the temple. These are of considerable interest, not only to scholars of history, to rebuild the political, social and economic history of the area, but also to those, who desire to know something of the ancient and time honoured institutions, endowments, administrative arrangement for management etc.,of the temples of our country. These inscriptions of the Tirumala temple, along with others from the neighbouring and ancilliary temples in lower Tirupathi and Tiruchanur, making a total of well over a thousand, furnish a continuous and authentic record of the transactions of the temple and the neighbouring area for the last seven or eight centuries. 

The systematic collection, decipherment, analysis, and publication of the epigraphs of the temple has been due, wholly to the untiring efforts of Sri Mahant Prayagdasji who was the Vicharanakarta of the Tirumala temple in 1920, and also of the then Dewan Peshkar Sri Doraiswamiah garu who later retired as a Deputy Collector in the old Madras State. Dr. F.W. Thomas of the India Office Library, and the late Rao Bahadur H.Krishna Sastry, a wellknown epigraphist of India, chose for this work Sri Sadhu Subramanya Sastry who was given adequate epigraphical training. Sri S.Subramanya Sastry took up this work in 1922 and in the course of the next ten years or so, copied the inscriptions on the walls of the temples of Tirumala, Tirupati and Tiruchanur, and also compiled an invaluable epigraphical report in two parts, 

276 

the first relating to the routine of the temple and its administration, and the second'about the political history of the area. The epigraphs have been published in original along with English introductory notes in six volumes over a period of years by the Tirumala- Tirupati Devasthanam. The Devasthanam has thus done very valuable pioneering work in the field of proper epigraphical collection and publication of the inscriptions found on the walls of the temple. 


## 2. Total Number of Epigraphs. 

There were in all 1180 inscriptions secured by Sri S.Subramanya Sastry. 236 of these belong to the times Pallavas, Cholas, Pandyas and the 1st Vijaya- nagar kings. There are 169 inscriptions of the period of Saluva Narasimha Raya, 229 of Sri Krishnadeva Raya, 251 of Sri Achyuta Raya, 147of Sadasiva- Raya and 135 of the Kings of Aravidu dynasty. The rest of the 13 inscrip- tions are miscellaneous ones. 

During the same period between 1920 and 1930 the copper plate epigraphs of the famous Tallapaka poets containing sankirtanas and other poetical works, were also discovered from a closed small room in the northern wall of the Vimana pradakshina of the temple. These are inscribed on big copper plates. The composition of the Tallapaka poets are of two kinds viz., minor poetical works in Telugu mostly on grammar, ethics etc., and the Sankirtanas, viz., Sringara sankirtanas, Adhyatma sankirtanas and Vairagya sankirtanas. Some of the minor poems, and some of the sankirtanas have been edited and have been brought out by the Devasthanam. It is however a matter of deep regret that inspite of the fact that these were discovered more than 50 years ago, systematic attempts at complete and critical edition of these invaluable records is yet to see the light of the day. These copper plates of sankirtanas were known to have existed from a long time ago. Robert Sewell the famous indologist, was told of the existence of "two cartloads of copper sasanas" during the time of his enquiry in the epigraphs of South India. It is expected that if these are fully edited critically and published, they would add a great deal to our general knowledge of those times. 

Of the 1180 and odd inscriptions which were copied between 1920 and 1930, 640 are from Sri Venkatesvara temple at Tirumala, 340 from Sri Govindaraja- swamy temple at Tirupati and the remaining are from other small temples. 

There are still about a 100 or more epigraphs in Tirumala temple which are yet to be copied and deciphered. This awaits the labours of future epi- graphists and historians. Here also with all the modern facilities for research 

277 

available now,. it is a great pity that the Tirumala-Tirupati Devasthanam has  not been able to complete this work.


## 3. State of Preservation of The Epigraphs. 

The copper plate inscriptions of the Tallapaka poets are in an excellent state of preservation. These copper plates are unlike the normal copper plate of inscriptions to which historians as accustomed and are far larger and measure 30* × 20′′ or 40′′ × 30′′. The characters are in the 14th, 15th century Telugu and reading the epigraphs is a comparatively easy affair. 

The epigraphs on stone belonging to the pre-Vijayanagar period are mostly fragmentary, incomplete, or damaged to such an extent, that they do not yield any information except a few disconnected syllables or words. This is mainly due to the frequent renovations carried on in the prakara walls and other structures in the temples, and especially due to large-scale remodelling done in the 13th Century A.D. to which reference has been made. Of particular interest in this connection would be the injunction of Sri Vira Narasimha Yadavaraya a feudatory chief of the 13th Century, communicated to the Sthanattars or the managers of the temple in the 40th year of his reign, while issuing orders on the petition of one Tiruppullanidasar for renovating the central shrine of Sri Venkatesvara, that they should invariably copy out the older inscriptions as they were found originally engraved on the particular parts to be repaired or rebuilt, and re-engrave them in their orginal position on the completion of the work. This clearly shows that the ancient Kings were fully aware of the importance of these inscriptions. Their respect and care for preserving these, might have been motivated more by the religious sanctity of the endowments, than by a desire for the preservation of historical records. At present, our knowledge of the existence of four Chola records in Tirumala temple is due to this order of Sri Vira Narasimha Yadavaraya and this shows that during those times, historical inscriptions were ordered to be re-engraved by royal mandate. However this is only an exception, and irreparable damage has been caused to the earlier epigraphs time and again during the repairs and renovations of the temple, with the result that a number of them are now either incomplete or merely fragmentary. 


## 4. THE TALLAPAKA COPPER PLATES. 

Besides the stone inscriptions about 3000 copper plates containing on the aggregate about 16000 devotional songs in the sankirtana style and other literary 

278 

THE EPIGRAPHS OF TIRUMALA TEMPLE 

pieces in Telugu composed by the group of the three poets of the Tallapaka family who flourished in the 16th Century A.D. under the patronage of the Vijayanagar kings of the second dynasty, and who were the hereditary musi- cians of the temple, were also discovered as stated above and also deciphered by Sri Sadhu Subramanya Sastry, the T.T.D. epigraphist. The grandson Chinna Tirumalacharya of Tallapaka Annamacharya in his poetical work "Annamacharya Charitamu" has mentioned that his grand-father Annama- charya composed 32,000 sankirtanas on Venkatesa. The copper plates dis- covered in 1920 s in the temple, had three sankirtanas engraved on each side of the copper plate and the copper plates were engraved on both sides. The total number of copper plates being exactly 2,590, at the rate of six sankirtanas per copper plate, the total number of discovered sankirtanas should come to 15,540. The correct total figure is 16582. Of these the compositions of Annamacharya are about 14,400, those of his son Pedda Tirumalacharya 1062, and of his grandson Chinna Tirumalacharya 1,120. 

Enquiries have revealed that these copper plates were transported to Tirupati and were then deciphered by Sri Sadhu Subramanya Sastry. His readings were made in manuscript. These manuscripts were then taken over to the Devasthanam press Office which was then located at Madras. The work was carried on by Pandit V. Vijayaraghavachary, who succeeded Sri Sadhu Subramanya Sastry. After sometime the Madras Officer was trans- ferred to another building, and the press manager while transporting the press and all other things, does not seem to have realised the importance of the paper manuscripts in which these sankiratanas were deciphered and these have been burnt as junk. Later on late Pandit Veturi Prabhakara Sastry who joined the Devasthanam Oriental Institute, has redeciphered these. He has done only a very small negligible portion-a few thousands out of the 16000 odd sankirtanas. Only very few have so for been printed. It is a great pity that the original decipherments prepared by Sri Sadhu Subramanya Sastry and his successor Pandit V. Vijayaraghavachary came to be burnt while the press office was shifted from Madras to Tirupati through sheer ignorance. The Tirumala-Tirupati Devasthanam, as a continuing body has to seriously take up the critical decipherment, edition and publication of these sankirtanas which are valuable not only for Telugu literature but also as a treasure of the legacy of Carnatic musiology of the medieval times. 


## 5. RANGE OF DATES OF THE EPIGRAPHS. 

The dates of the above-said stone records range from the 51st year of the reign of Ko-Vijaya-Dantivikrama Varman of the Pallava line (No.219-G.T.) 

279 

THE TIRUMALA TEMPLE 

(about-830) A.D.) when a certain Ulagapperumanar of Solanur in Sola-nadu instituted the service of a nanda-vilakku, i.e., burning a lamp, down to the Kaliyuga year 5010, Kilaka(1909 A.D.) (No. 242-T.T.), when gilded kalasm was fixed over the vimanam of Sri Venkatesvara's Shrine at Tirumala during the regime of the then Vicharanakarta of the Devasthanams, His Holiness Sri Mahant Prayagadasji of Sri Hatiramji Matham, by his brother-disciple, the late Adhikari at Tirumala, Bavaji Ramalakshmanadasji. Though the records cover a period of nearly 11 centuries, they are not fully representative of all the South Indian dynasties, for there is a disproportionately large number of inscriptions belonging to the Vijayanagara period, while the earlier dynasties are represented very scantily and the post-Vijayanagara times by scarcely any. 


## 6. LANGUAGE OF THE INSCRIPTIONS. 

Except a few, almost all the epigraphs are in the Tamil language and alphabet interspersed with Grantha characters and only about 50 are in Telugu and Kanarese. Of the period prior to the time of Krishnaraya, we have only a single Telugu inscription (No.237-T.T.) of Saluva Mangideva Maharaya dated in Saka 1281 and two Kanarese inscriptions, one of Virapratapa-Devaraya Maharaya (No. 188-T.T.) dated in Saka 1351, and one of Saluva Narasimha (No. 8-G.T.) dated in Saka 1389. All the gifts of Krishnaraya and his two queens and one of Achutaraya are recorded in the three languages Telugu, Kannada and Tamil in their respective alphabets, while a copy of one of the above relating to Krishnaraya composed in Kannada language is engraved in the Nandi-Nagari characters. After Achyutaraya there is a conspicuous absence of both Telugu and Kannada in the inscriptions with the exception of the local chief Malti Anantarajayya (No. 269–G.T.) in Telugu of the Saka year 1550 and one in Kannada of Saka 1606 (No.263--T.T.) 


## 7. BROAD CONTENTS OF THE INSCRIPTIONS. 

Epigraphs of the pre-Vijayanagara times generally record services of lighting lamps in the presence of the different deities or elsewhere,in the evening or through-out day and night. For this purpose the donors paid a certain sum of money into the temple-treasury to carry on the service. In a few instances, they purchased cows and presented them to the temple. In later times certain donors adopted this latter course, when they arranged for offerings of milk and curds or offerings of food mixed with them. We find that ghee alone was used for all lamps inside the temple and this practice still continues at Tirumala. 

280 

Besides gifts of lamps, we meet with also gifts of lands, jewels and money. Kings, chiefs and rich persons contributed their quota of offerings and endow- ments. The later inscriptions record provision for nitya-naivedyam (daily food-offerings) and for several festivals, processions and asthanams in the temples for the different deities. To this end gifts of lands and villages as well as of money and gold were made to the temples. Money and gold thus deposited were only in a few cases lent out at interest, but usually they were invested in the devadana (grant to God) villages belonging to the temple through the excavation of fresh irrigation sources or renewal of the existing ones which were in disrepair at the time. Some cases occur in which waste and uncultivated land in the devandana villages was brought under the plough and adequate water-supply provided by the donors at their own cost, and, in return for this service, the temple was required to arrange for food-offerings to the deities in their name. Likewise, in the devadana villages in which sufficient irriga- tion facilities were lacking and from which, therefore, full benefit could not be derived, certain devoteee undertook the excavation of tanks, lakes and channels and thus provided for more extensive cultivation; and as a mark of recognition of such services the temple bound itself to perpetuate their memory by institu- ting in their name some charities, such as naivadyam (offering food) to the deities from the enhanced yield obtained from these villages and distributing the offered food among the devotees assembling in the temple to receive it. 

A number of flower gardens comes to notice as having been formed through private individual efforts with flowerplants and trees reared and subsequently handed over to the temple for the utilisation of the flowers in the decoration of the deities daily and on occasions of processions in festivals. We find several Ramanuja-kutams or feeding-houses instituted both at Tirumala, and Tirupati, large number of them having been located at Tirumala, providing for the free boarding of the numerous pilgrims visiting the temple from all parts of the country almost throughout the year, and, more so, on the occasion of festivals. 

A few inscriptions register sales of houses and of house-sites to the temple. It cannot be now surmised under what circumstances they were purchased and for what purpose. One epigraph records the demarcation of the boundary line between Tirupati and Avilali, about a mile to the south of the former, both being devadana villages. 


## 8. ROYAL BENEFACTORS. 

The inscriptions clearly indicate that the temples of Sri Venkatesvara at Tirumala and Sri Govindaraja at Tirupati enjoyed the partonage of sovereigns 

281 

THE TIRUMALA TEMPLE 

and chiefs who richly endowed them. Among this class of benefactors stand out most prominently:- 

(i) The queen of Parantaka II Sundara-Chola, "the King who slept at the Golden-Hall", and daughter of Cheraman. Who presented to Sri Venkatesvara a pattam or plate for the forehead, set with precious stones, in the 16th year of the reign of Rajaraja I (equivalent to 1001 A.D.) (No. 17-T.T.) 

(ii) A Pallava queen, by name Samavai, who presented a kiritam (diadem), a necklace of four strings and other ornaments for the hands, waist and feet of Sri Venkatesvara, and consecrated a silver image of His under the appella- tion of Manavalapperumal, provided for processions for this image and endowed the temple with lands in Tiruchchukanur (Tiruchanur), sometime in the third-quarter of the 10th century, (Nos. 18 and 19—T.T.). 

(iii) Jatavarman Sundara-Pandya I (1250 to 1275 A.D.) who placed a glided kalasam over the vimanam of Sri Venkatesvara's shrine. 

(iv) The queen of Vira-Narasimha Yadavaraya,a Chola subordinate of the 13th century, who instituted a fresh Brahmotsavam in the Tamil month of Ani for Sri Govindaraja, in addition to the primary one held in Vaikasi,con- structed a four-faced car and made a gift of half the village of Paindappalli meeting the expenses of the newly started festival and for effecting repairs to the temple from the balance, if any. 

(v) Tiruvenkatanatha Yadavaraya, a subordinate of the last Hoysala king Vira-Vallala III, who granted, in the thirties of the 14th century, two villages to the temple as sarvamanya (tax-free) for propitiating the deity daily with food- offerings. 

(vi) Saluva Mangideva Maharaja does not appear to have been keen about enriching the temples either in the form of lands or money. His fancy was for splendour and magnificence as testified to by his covering the vimanam or the tower over the central shrine at Tirumala with gilded copper-plate, and placing a gilded kalasam over it in Saka 1281. This must certainly have been an expensive undertaking, and the temple should have presented, as he desired, a noble appearance, enthralling the minds of the pilgrims by its beauty. 

(vii) Devaraya II merited extensive divine grace through the help he rendered towards the revival of the Vedaparayanam in Sri Venkatesvara's shrine at Tirumala in Saka 1355. He had already granted three villages to the temple in Saka 1351 as the usual royal benefaction. 

282 

THE EPIGRAPHS OF TIRUMALA TEMPLE 

(viii) Saluva Narasimha's devotion flowed in the usual channel of making gifts of villages in the several parts of the kingdom between the Saks years 1378 and 1410. 

(ix) Krishnaraya not only presented diadems and ornaments set with precious stones, and gold and silver vessels, both for the Mula-Murti (the chief deity), viz., Sri Venkatesa, and the Utsava-Murtis (the processional images), but also endowed the temple with villages in the districts of Chandragiri, Udayagiri and Penugonda. His two queens Tirumaladevi and Chinnadevi were present with him during almost all his visits to Tirumala and they shared with him the credit for the gifts and grants which were made by him between Saka 1434 and 1442. 

(x) Varadajidevi-amman, the queen of Achyutaraya, comes next. She granted six villages to the temple so as to serve for the propitiation of Sri Venkatesvara. 

(xi) Matli Kumara-Anantarajayya is the latest of the royal benefactors. An inscription of his enumerates his variegated charities at several centres of pilgrimage, among which Tirupati figures as the recipient of three golden asva (horse), gaja (elephant) and samarabhupala (chariot) vahanams (vehicles); one padma-pitham (lotus-shaped seat), one ratna-kiritam (gem-set crown), one naivedya-bhajanam (plate or dish for offering food), one unnata-keli- mantapam (a lofty porch for pleasure-swinging for the deities), one sopana- marga (flight of steps on the side of the front hill), and one agra (top or front) gopura (tower): all these services rendered in the name of Sri Venkatesvara; two golden elephant and horse vehicles for Sri Govindaraja; and the charity of one anna-satram (free feeding-house) at the Alvar-tirtha at the foot of the front hill and another on the way up the same hill. 

9. NITYA DIPAM AND NITYA NAIVEDYAM. 

Many of the epigraphs record arrangements made for lighting a nitya dipam or keeping a nanda vilakku burning before the Lord. Some made arrangements for endowments from which naivedyam or food offerings were to be made to the Lord. 219-G.T. of the 51st year of the reign of the Pallava king Dantivikrama varman of circa 830 A.D. is the earliest inscription which records an arrangement for keeping a lamp burning before the utsava murti. The Chola records also register donations and gifts intended for nanda vilakku or for aradhana (food offerings). In the Vijayanagar period food offerings took precedence over lamp lighting, and in certain cases, presentation 

283 

THE TIRUMALA TEMPLE 

of cows was preferred to presentation of gold since cows served the additional purpose of yielding ghee also in addition to the offering of the dairy products to the Lord. No. 92-T.T. records the gift of Amatyasekhara Mallanna who was the Chief Minister both under Devarya I and II in the matter of naivedyam and nityadipam to Sri Venkatesa. 

The most prominent instance of such a gift of cows occurs in the case of Sriman Mahanayankacharya (chief-commander) Periya-Oala-Nayakkar Rama-Nayakkar who served as a general under king Vira-Narasimha, the elder brother of Krishnaraya, and under Krishnaraya also, He presented 100 cows in Saka 1426(=1504 A.C.) for burning a lamp (No. 305 T.T.); 50 cows a second time in Saka 1434 (=1512 A. C.) for another lamp (No. 312-T T.); and finally 200 cows in Saka 1435(=1514 A.C.) (No. 306-T.T.)for the supply of dairy products daily for one nali of Paledukulambu (i.e., thick-boiled milk with the cream formed over it) for being offered to the deity. 

No 59-T.T.is a somewhat peculiar record. Instead of the usual gift of lamps that we meet with in other inscriptions, we find here an arrangement made by Koneri and Ulagalandavelan, head-men (kartar) of Sattukudi- Marudur, a village in the sub-division of Narayanapurapparru in the Chandra- giri-rajya, by which they deputed in Saka 1384 (1462 A.C.), for the merit of Saluva Narasimha, certain persons, being residents of the above village of whom four are mentioned by name, for the service of lighting lamps (tiru- vilakkukkudi) in the temple of Tiruvenkatamudaiyan, and directed them to ren- der service to the temple in perpetuity through their descendants. These were also enjoined to measure out two marakkals of ghee every year with the measure called chalukya-Narayanan-kal, as they used to do till then, and obtain the certificate issued by the Jiyar under his signature. It would appear that these men had to deliver two marakkals of ghee to the temple in Tirupati by virtue of some previous agreement or contract, probably for some favour received by them in the form of loan of cows belonging to the temple or for some other reason which is not explicitly stated in the record; and this deli- very of ghee of two marakkals was declared to be imperative on them not- withstanding their prospective service in the temple at Tirumala. Neither is any reason given for the deputation of these men for lighting service in the Tirumala temple. Perhaps by the middle of the 14th century the duty of lighting the lamps presented liberally by the devotees had become very onerous and impossible of being fulfilled in the usual way by the then existing staff and consequently necessitated the appointment of additional hands to discharge it adequately. 

284 

THE EPIGRAPHS OF TIRUMALA TEMPLE 

10. Sandhi offerings (Food offerings). 

During the Vijayanagar period food offerings came to be extensively provided for by the devotees. These were known as Sandhi offerings and were given at the end of each puja commencing early in the morning and closing early in the night. These offerings were so extensive that in some cases they came to be called after the donor, like Bukkaraya Sandhi, Nara- simharaya sandhi, etc. 

Sitakaragandan-sandhi (No. 195-T.T.) is the earliest in date belonging to the pre-Vijayanagara times that we meet with, for whose institution Immadi- Rahuttarayan Singaya-Dannayakkan, a general under Tiruvenkatanatha Yadavaraya, gave to the temple, as a tiruvidaiyattam, Singana-nallur alias Pongalur in Illattur-nadu which had been previously bestowed upon him as a sarvamanya by Tiruvenkatanatha Yadavaraya. 

1 

Bukkarayan-sandhi is mentioned as the primary one during which, along with the tirupponakam (cooked rice mixed with green gram, ghee, etc.,) to be offered as originally stipulated, koyil-kelvi Emperumanar-Jiyar, manager of Pankayachchelli-tirunandavanam at Tirumala and the head of a religious institution at Tirumala and Tirupati, arranged in Saka 1367 for offering for Sri Venkatesvara two tirupponakam daily (No. 106-T.T.). And Periya- perumal jiyar arranged likewise in Saka 1380 for two tirupponakam daily (No. 47—T.T.). No. 23—T.T. which is dated in Saka 1372 mentions Rayar- sandhi. We note from No. 3-T.T. that Saluva Narasimha provided in Saka 1378 for an offering of rajanna-tirupponakam during the udayakala- sandhi and granted as sarvamanya the village of Alipuram; and again in Saka 1389, he gave five villages, four of which are mentioned to have been situated in the Chandragiri-rajya and the fifth in the Padaividu-sirmai, in order to serve for sandhi-muppadu, i.e., thirty units of cooked food (No. 66– T.T.). In Saka 1395, Saluva Narasimha instituted the dolotsavam for five days and provided for offerings of food during the night sandhi named after his mother Mallayamman. No. 46-T.T. dated in Saka 1393 and No. 188 -G.T. dated in Saka 1397 mention Narasimharaya-sandhi which perhaps indicates the thirty sandhis noted above. 

11. Vedaparayana, 

Recitation of vedas in the temples is considered to be an essential part of the temple services. Vedaparayana in Tirumala temple was standardized properly by Devaraya II of the first Vijayanagar dynasty. The epigraphs state that Vedaparayana went out of vogue in the Tirumala temple and that 

285 

THE TIRUMALA TEMPLE 

this defect was taken to the notice of the royal officer Devanna Udaiyar by Alagappiranar also called Thirukkalikandridasar, with a request that this may be revived and continued for the benefit of the Devaraya maharaya. Twenty four mahajanas or learned brahmins of Siddhakuttai also called as Srinivasapuram, were engaged in chanting the vedas in the presence of the Lord. 

The king approved of the arrangement and was pleased to grant the half-share belonging to the Raja Bhandaram (king's treasury) in the village of Siddhakuttai alias Srinivasapuram in Kottala-sthalam situated in Vaikunda-- valanadu, as srotriyam, for the purpose. The grant of half the village secured by Alagappiranar Tirukkalikanridasar was made over to the twenty-four Brahmanas. But these Brahmanas, feeling that this half share was insufficient to maintain them, petitioned the Sthanattar for the grant of the other half also of the village which was owned by the Sri-Bhandaram (temple-treasury). The temple authorities could not alienate their half-share, it being probably an endowment to the temple for a specific purpose, and they therefore devised a plan by which, while the temple could account for the produce from its half-share of the village and maintain the trust for whose conduct its managers were made responsible, the services of the twenty-four Brahmanas engaged for the Vedaparayanam might be firmly and permanently secured by allowing them a full living. Here again this device was effected by Tirukkalikanridasar. 

It appears that the annual yield from the village of Srinivasapuram for the share of the temple was 200 panam and, if this share of the temple in the village had to be parted with this 200 panam had somehow to be made good, The villagers of all the full devadana villages belonging to the temple situated in the Tirukkudavur-nadu and Vaikunda-valanady were called upon to contribute their mite so that the full sum of 200 panam could be made up. The villagers agreed to this contribution, solemnly vowing with libations of gold and water on the Usthanadvadasi day in the cyclic year Pramadicha corresponding to Saka 1355 to pay their share collectively for each village into the temple-treasury, commencing from the same year, towards the conduct of the Vedaparayanam. On the strength of this agreement executed by the villagers represented by the Periyanattu-velan and the Ur-kanakku or the velan of each individual tiruvidaiyattam village, the Sthanattar of the temple were emboldened, their scruples and restraints being set at rest, to grant the half-share of the temple in the village of Srinivasapuram to the twenty- four Maha Brahmanar reciting the Vedas and thus gain a double object. No doubt the technical flaw arising from their alienation of property endowed for maintaining the original charity was desired to be obviated through these 

286 

THE EPIGRAPHS OF TIRUMALA TEMPLE 

devices, but whatever kind of compensation might have been effected, the alienation must have been a breach of trust, But perhaps it weighed lightly against the heavy pressure of the necessity and urgency for the renewal of the Vedaparayanam service in the temple. 

Prior to the execution of the above agreement by the villagers, it appears that a temporary interim device was also adopted. It was to lease out the half-share of the village on Srotriya-Kuttakai to Tirukkalikanridasar who on the one hand paid the lease amount into the temple-treasury and on the other permitted the Brahmanas to reap the benefit from the balf village. This was only preliminary to the final stage of complete alienation and prior to obtaining the consent of the villagers. 

Even though the full village of Srinivasapuram comprising the two half shares of Raja-Bhandaram and Sri-Bhandaram was now granted to the twenty- four Mahajanam of the same place, yet all of them were not required to render the service simultaneously. It was stipulated that only two of them should daily recite the Vedas in the presence of Sri Venkatesvara and conduct the Vedaparayanam. It is therefore likely that they were given discretion to divide themselves into 12 sets of 2, each set chanting the Vedas in a particular month during the year in turn. 

There are references to Vedaparayanam at a later date, i.e., during the time of the Second Vijayanagara dynasty, and we may take it that, after Saka 1355 when it was revived by Devaraya II, there has not been any break in its continuity down to this day, and that it has added, as it was expected to do, to the glory and sanctity of the temple which is stated to have enjoyed all other Vaibhogamgal. 

Besides Vedaparayanam, we meet with arrangements for the reading of Puranams on certain sacred days. In a record of the 16th century (No. 3—— G.T.) we note that on the day of kaisikadvadasi (i.e., the 12th day of the bright half of the Telugu month of Kartikam) Ananta-vrata-puranam was read, perhaps in Sri Govindaraja's temple at Tirupati. Similarly an inscription (No. 253-—T.T.), dated in Saka 1413, records an arrangement made for the reading of Tiruvenkata-mahatmyam by Pasindi Venkatatturaivanjiyar Ramanujayyar, the donor in the above record, on a day in the month of Margali. 

12. Abhishekam. 

The epigraphs also give us extensive details about Tirumanjanam or abhishekam for the Lord at Tirumala. 

287 

THE TIRUMALA TEMPLE 

+ 

The earliest reference occurs in No. 4-T.T. dated in Saka 1386, when Kandadai Ramanujayyangar arranged, as his service (Kainkaryam) for the Alagappiranar-tirumanjanam conducted daily for Sri Venkatesvara, for the supply of perfumery to the temple through his Ekaki (i.e., unmarried) disciples of the Sattada-Srivaishnava sect. The perfumery consisted of meditta- sattuppadi or Ghandanam (sandal-paste) manjal-kappu (turmeric), nelli-kappu (emblic myrobalan), kasturi-kappu (musk) and karpura-kappu or pachcha- karpuram (refined camphor); and along with these a small cloth and betel- leaves and nuts were supplied by them. 

The Sattada-Ekaki-Srivaishnavas were enjoined by their guru to be present for the tirumanjanam and look to its proper conduct daily. On its completion, after an honourable mention of their guru's name, the disciples were bidden to bring back to him 4 betel-leaves and 4 nuts. 

Through another record (No. 187–T.T.) Tirukkalikanridasar Alagappira- nar provided for the supply of meditta pulugu-kappu for the deity's face (tirumukhamandalam) each day for six months, together with sandal-paste (meditta-sattuppadi) and camphor for waving a light (alatti or arati). 

This is the first mention we get of pulugu-kappu and here it is stated that it was arranged to be done every-day for six months. The next reference to it occurs in No. 336--T.T. dated in Saka 1418, wherein Kandadai Appachchiyar-Anna provided on the Friday occurring once in 15 days which happened to be the day of pulugu-kappu-murai for Sri Venkatesvara, for the recitation of the Ula, a species of poem in praise of Kandadai Ramanujay- yangar and for the offering of two atirasappadi for the deity at the time of anointment with pulugu-kappu. The expressions of the record indicate that the pulugu-kappu function had been carried on for some time past and that men had become familiarised to it by that time. Again in Saka 1427 (No. 276-T.T.) this same fortnightly anointment on every second Friday becomes the occasion for offering one nayaka-taligai and one appapadi to the deity as the service of Dharmapuram Sittamu Setti, one of the nagarattar of Narasingarayapuram, a suburb of Tirupati. But the time for offering was fixed immediately after Alarmelmangai-Nachchiyar, i.e., “Vakshasthala- Lakshmi" supported on His chest by Sri Venkatesvara, received the tiru- manjanam. 

Thus we find the rite of pulugu-kappu first arranged apparently in Saka 1356 to form an item of the daily routine, passing by about Saka 1418 into a special fortnightly function combined with the bath on alternate Fridays. This does not, however, preclude the possibility of its daily course. For 

288 

THE EPIGRAPHS OF TIRUMALA TEMPLE 

now-a-days there is the occasion of a daily bath comprised within the rites of the tomalaseva in the forenoon, when the Bhoga-Murti, represented by a silver image, receives the bath. The original provision might have been of this nature, intended for Sri Venkatesvara, the Mula-Murti, but actually utilised for the Bhoga-Murti. 

In about three decades from Saka 1427, the date of the second record (No. 276-T.T.) mentioning the observance of the pulugu-kappu-murai in the Tirumala temple on alternate Fridays, we find that the fortnightly function had been converted by Saka 1456 (No. 331-T.T.) not only into a weekly one held on each of the 53 Fridays in the year, but also a monthly one conducted on each of the 13 days of Mrigasirsham star occurring in the year, this being the asterism under which king Achyutaraya Maharaya was born. Bhandaram Apparasar's son, Siru-Timmayyar, had effected this augmentation. Thus the original 26 or 27 pulugu-kappu-murai days had been extended by Siru- Timmayyar so as to aggregate to 66 days comprising both the intervening Fridays till then left out and other thirteen days of Mrigasirsham star sanctified by the birth of the Vijayanagara king under its ascendency. 

13. Utsavams. 

Under royal patronage the temple had received gifts and endowments to serve for the primary needs of worship of the deities, and the next concern of the worshippers and the devotees was with regard to the augmentation of the grandeur of the temples in the matter of the worship of the deities by means of elaborate festivals and plentiful food-offerings, and in the matter of construction of spacious and artistic mantapams and imposing prakarams and gopurams. 

The festivals in the temples may be classified into the fundamental, the auxilliary and the secondary ones, according to the nature of their institution. The fundamental festivals are obligatory, being enjoined by the sastras and agamas to be observed at fixed times, and their omission would be considered inauspicious while their restitution would call for special preliminary purifi- catory rites. To this class belongs the Brahmotsavam. The auxiliary festivals have their origin in the traditional divine life of the deity or in the incarnations of Vishnu on earth. Such are the tiruppalli-eluchchi- i.e., Margali or the Dhanurmasa festival and those conducted on the days of the birth-asterism of the deities. The secondary ones are of a subsidiary character and were instituted by devotees with a view to gain religious merit and invoke the blessings of the almighty on the days fixed for them. These are usually the days of the birth--asterism of the donor, his religious preceptor, liege-lord or other relation or friend.

THE TIRUMALA TEMPLE 

As to festivals, the earliest epigraph in the collection from Tiruchanur, No. 219-G.T. dated in the 51st year of the reign of the Pallava king Ko- Vijaya-Dantivikramavarman (equivalant to 830 A.D.), records a deposit of 40 kalanju of gold by Ulagapperumanar of Solanur in Solanadu with the assembly at Tiruchchukanur (Tiruchanur) for the purpose of keeping a lamp before the processional image newly installed in the shrine of Tiruvenkatattu- Emperuman-Adigal. Here occurs the earliest mention of the installation of a processional image. 

64 

The Chola records, so far available, make no mention of festivals, but the later ones enable us to discern the simultaneous increase in the quantity and variety of food-offerings with the number and magnitude of the festivals. This is the period of time, when on the decline of the ancient Hindu kingdoms of the South, there arose into prominence, in the middle region, certain political aspirants, such as the Gandagopalas, the Yadavarayas, the Kadavarayas and the Sambuvarayas, who apparently endeavoured to carve out independent kingdoms and claimed universal sway" over the land. These families of chieftains had, in their glorious days, rendered their share of service to the temples at Tirumala and Tirupati, directly, or otherwise, by means of gifts and grants, for the perpetuation of nitya-dipam and nitya-naivedyam, as well as utsavams for the deities, so much so that by about 1300 A.D., we find that, in addition to the two Brahmotsavams observed in the 10th century to have been celebrated in the months of Purattasi and Margali, similar festivals were established in the month of Adi at Tirumala for Sri Venkatesvara. (No. 189-T.T.). 

Coming to the Vijayanagara period, we note that Harihara II instituted a fresh festival in Masi at Tirumala through the agency of Mullai Tiruvenkata Jiyar, and the income of the village of Pungodu appears to have been dedicated by him for its expenses (Nos. 61 and 103-T.T.). The other references to festivals are not quite definite about their number and their time (cf. Nos. 61 and 340-T.T.). But, as time advanced, we find that before the middle of the 16th century, they rose at Tirumala to ten and these were probably distributed among the ten months of the year, with the exception of Vaikasi and Ani which witnessed two festivals in Tirupati for Sri Govindaraja. 

The earliest reference to Adhyayanotsavam occurs about 1400 A.D. and the latest is in 1635 A.D. It is still observed in all these temples at the present day. 

290 

THE EPIGRAPHS OF TIRUMALA TEMPLE 

Pavitrotsavam was first instituted in Tirumala at the instance of Saluva Mallayadeva Maharaja in Saka 1385 (1463 A.D.) during the time of Saluva Narasimha (No. 157-T.T.). It being a new institution we are happily supplied with full details of the rites and functions pertaining to the ceremony lasting virtually for a period of 5 days, but actually for 6 days including the preliminaries of seed-sowing on the night preceeding. The ceremonial comprised also the recitation of the Vedas and the reading of the Puranas during these five days for which the Brahmana reciters and readers were remunerated. 

When the queen of Vira-Narasimha Yadavaraya, a Chola feudatory of the 13th century, instituted a second Brahmotsavam in the month of Ani for Sri Govindaraja (No. 111–G.T.), the Vasantotsavam day became doubled, and this number appears to have remained constant until the middle of the 16th Century when 2 more Brahmotsavams were instituted. A similar auxiliary Vasantotsavam was arranged for the last 2 days of the Kodai festival by Karanika Basavarasar in Saka 1437, Yuva, during the reign of Krishnaraya. (No. 311-T.T.). 

The Kodai-tirunal was a summer festival, just as Vasantotsavam was one pertaining to the spring season.` It was celebrated for a period of 20 days divided into two halves. It was conducted both at Tirumala for Sri Malaiyap- pan (the processional image of Sri Venkatesvara), His two divine consorts and Senai-Mudaliyar (No. 311-T.T.), and in Tirupati for Sri Govindaraja (Nos. 105-G.T., 277 and 281-T.T.). No. 251-G.T., dated in Saka 1454, Khara, records a Kodai festival for Sri Periya-Raghunathan, i.e., Sri Kodanda- Rama, during the month of Ani. 

Besides these Vasanta and Kodai festivals, we also meet with the Anna- unjal-(swan-shaped swing) tirunal, and the Tiruppali-odam-tirunal (floating festival) conducted for the processional images. The Anna-unjal festival was started in the Tirumala temple by Saluva Narasimha in Saka 1395, Vijaya, and was stipulated to be celebrated for a period of 5 days virtually, but actually for 7 days (No. 197—T.T.), 

The inscription No. 197–T.T., which records the institution of the Unjal festival at Tirumala by Saluva Narasimha, mentions that a Tiruppaliodattirunal (floating festival) was also conducted as the dharmam of Saluva Narasimha, and that provision was made for offering 4 appa-padi on the occasion. 

References to the swinging and the floating festivals occur in later records. Nos. 271-T.T. dated in Saka 1426 and 97-G.T, dated in Saka 1445 state that the Unjal festival was celebrated for a period of 5 days in the two temples. 

291 

THE TIRUMALA TEMPLE 

But the references to the Tiruppaliodam point out to a one day's festival as in Nos. 281-T.T. and 256–G.T., while in No. 97-G.T. It is said to form a day's function, being affixed to the Kodai festival on its 10th day, and in No. 83-T.T., dated in Saka 1455, Vijaya, it is stated that the Jalakridai- tiruppaliodattirunal was to be conducted for 9 days in the Achyutarayar- 

Koneri. 

Closely akin to the above are those festivals in temples which were instituted by devotees for conducting special worship to the deities, on each anniversary day of the birth-asterism of certain great men, such as the alvars (saints), acharyas (spiritual teachers), kings, princes, and ruling chiefs, and rich men and other devoted persons who were anxious about invoking the blessings of the Almighty upon them on the particular day each year for a long and prosperous life. Special worship including food-offerings and processions were arranged on these occasions 

Besides, certain other days, such as the. Tai-Amavasya, Ani-Amavasya, Dipavali, Kartikai, Yugadi, Maha-Navami, Ratha-Saptami, etc., which are held sacred by the Hindu public, were also made festive occasions on which the deities were propitiated with offerings and taken out on some vehicles in procession. 

14. Vahanams. 

The inscriptions give numerous references to festivals in the temples, but, in all but those that are dated in the 16th century, we have no information as to the Vahanam or vehicle used on each day of the procession of the deities through the streets during the Brahmotsavams. The epigraphs dated during the reigns of Achyutaraya and Sadasivaraya mention the names of about half a dozen vehicles and further indicate that the same vehicle was used for procession on different days. Nos. 269 and 270-G.T. record a present of two sets of golden elephant and horse vehicles, a set apiece to the two temples of Sri Venkatesvara and Sri Govindaraja, by Matla Kumara Anantarajayya, We also hear of other vehicles, such as Nampiran or Tiruchchi; (No. 66–G.T.), and Hamsa-vahanam (swan) and Ghatakapakshi-vahanam (the Indian or black cuckoo). As in the other cases, information is lacking as regards the days when they were employed. These Vahanams served their purpose not only during Brahmotsavams, but during all other festivals in which processions were conducted, as, for example, the employment of the Surya-prabha-vahanam on the Ratha-Saptami day (No. 321–G.T.). 

292 

THE EPIGRAPHS OF TIRUMALA TEMPLE 

15. Nandavanas or Flower Gardens. 

A number of devotees felt the inadequacy of the supply of flowers for Sri Venkatesvara, which was a prime requisite for a deity's decoration in the course of the daily worship as well as during festivals. The devotees realised the difficulties of constant supply and set themselves to form gardens and cultivate plants and place the produce at the disposal of the temple. Each garden was in charge of a manager who usually supervised it and took work from the gardeners. The workers were generally paid from 3 to 6 panam each month for their labour, while the manager, it would appear, held an honorary charge. 

Frequently these devotees built mantapams in their flower-gardens and in some cases deposited sums of money or transferred the possession of the gardens together with the mantapams to the temple-treasury, which was under obligation ever after to take up and discharge the services to the temple in the name of the donor and also undertake to pay the jivitam (monthly salary) of the gardeners, or issue a quantity of the offered food each day to them for cultivating the flower-garden so as to facilitate the perennial supply of flowers and herbs. It seems very likely that these gardens were in many cases cultivated by Sattada-Srivaishnavas who are even at the present day under the name of Dasa-Nambis carrying on the service of making flowers garlands in the Tirupati temple (Nos. 197 and 200-T.T.). Though instances of the cultivation of flower-gardens occur from about 1300 A.D. (125—G.T.) onwards, the numerous cases of forming gardens referred to in the inscriptions of the latter part of the 14th and the earlier part of the 15th centuries indicate the inadequacy of the supply of flowers, in spite of scores of well maintained gardens dedicated to the temples. In No. 243-T.T., we note that the Tiruppanipillai, i.e., the officer in charge of Public works pertaining to the temple, took up the responsibility for supplying garlands of flowers to the deity on behalf of Mukhappalam Nagama-Nayaka, a general under Saluva Narasimharaya Maharaya-Udaiyar for whose merit Nagama-Nayaka instituted the service, and transferred the possession of the village of Tiradampadi, his fief, to the temple as Tiruvidaiyattam-Tiruppanipuram. The temple managers accepting the responsibility for the supply of flowers on behalf of a donor and the grant of a village for the purpose form the peculiar features of the record. 

Of the different kinds of flowers grown in the gardens and in ponds, Senkalunir, i.e., the red lotus, appears from its special mention and from the arrangements made for its cultivation in ponds. (Nos. 125-G.T. 

293 

THE TIRUMALA TEMPLE 

and 53 and 153-T.T.) to have been held in high esteem. In the flower- gardens were also cultivated aromatic herbs, such as maru (maruvam), damana (davanam) and tulasi (the sacred basil) (No. 56, A-T.T.) which were required for the worship of the deities daily. 

16, Devadana Villages and Lands. 

The high esteem in which these temples were held and the solicitous care with which they were looked after by the Hindu kings and their officers are sufficiently indicated by the services and charities they instituted in them and the presents, gifts and endowments they made towards their permanent conduct. The endowments mostly took the form of lands and villages which were granted in many cases as sarvamanya. More than a hundred and fifty villages thus endowed come to notice, the majority of them being situated within the Chandragirirajya in the Tirukkudavurnadu and Vaikunda valanadu, two sub-districts comprised within the major district of Tiruvenkatakottam. In the pre-Vijayanagar days, the temple seems to have come into possession of only a few villages, but the major portion of its endowments belong to the Vijayanagara period. The great number of services and charities instituted during the Vijayanagara times in the form of nitya-naivedyam (daily food- offerings) to the deities, tirunal (festivals) with processions and offerings, tirunals (festivals) with procesions and offerings, nandavanams (flower-gardens), mantapams and gopurams, Ramanuja-kutams, etc., necessitated adequate provision being made for their regular and permanent conduct and preserva- tion, and the only means by which this could be effected was through an endow- ment of land or village which not only formed a permanent property but also yielded a permanent annual income through which the objects of the donors could be fulfilled. 

The earliest gift of land, so far known, was that of some seven thousand kuli of land in Tiruchchukanur made by the Pallava queen Samavai who purchased it as a number of plots from the Sabhaiyar of the place and other private owners and granted the whole to the temple for meeting the charges for propitiating daily the image of Manavalapperumal and of the two festivals instituted by her for this image (Nos. 18 and 19 T.T.). 

Under the auspices of some of the powerful local chiefs of the 13th and 14th centuries, viz., the Gandagopalas and the Yadavarayas, several gifts of land were made from time to time. Vijaya-Gandagopala's reign witnessed at least one instance of such a gift (No. 127—G.T.). The Yadavarayas evinced deep interest for the temple and endowed it with lands and villages. During 

294 

THE EPIGRAPHS OF TIRUMALA TEMPLE 

the reign of Tirukkalattideva Yadavaraya entitled Prabhuta-rajasraya, Chandra- kula- tilaka, Chalukya-Narayana, Srimadbhujabala, etc., the village of Kudavur in which certain plots of land were previously in the possession and enjoyment of the temple, become a full devadana village on the recommendation of the assembly at Avilali of the request of the Sthanattar (No. 170-T.T.). Vira- Rakshasa Yadavaraya's service consisted in the grant of some land in Tirukku- kudavur-nadu made with the object of offering food to Sri Venkatesvara (No. 293-T.T.). In the 30th year of the reign of Vira-Narasinga Yadavaraya, his queen granted half of the village of Paindapalli, of which the other half was already a davadanam, with the remission of the taxes thereon, so as to .neet the expenses of the festival which she newly started for Sri Govindaraja in the month of Ani (No. 111-G.T.) 

Coming to the Vijayanagara period, we notice that Harihara III assigned in Saka 1310, the cyclic year Prabhava, the revenues of the village of Pungodu for the conduct of a festival to commence from the same year in the Tirumala temple during the month of Masi. The village was not given over to the temple but remained in the hands of one Mullai Tiruvenkata Jiyar who paid into the temple-treasury during the year 100 panam being the income from the village (No. 103 and 61-T.T.) By Saka 1355 falling within the reign of Devaraya II, the temple came into possession of half the village of Siddhakuttai alias Srinivasapuram, a few miles to the west of Tirupati, and in that year conferred it upon the 24 Mahajanam or learned men of that place who were engaged to recite every day in the presence of Sri Venkatesvara the Vedas which had ceased to be chanted for some time past (No.s 89, 149,161 and 162-T.T.) Already in Saka 1351, Devaraya II had endowed the temple with three villages to serve for certain offerings which he ordered to be made to Sri Venkatesvara in his own name, while his minister Mallana provided for increased irrigation sources in two devadana villages and thus added to the income of the temple No. 187-T.T.). 

Among the Vijayanagara rulers Saluva Narasimha is the greatest of the benefactors to the temple. Saluva Narasimha's endowments comprise the following villages:- 

1. Alipuram granted as Sarvamanya 2. Agaram or Brahmana-agarharam 

Murukkambattu 

3. Vanjippakkam, Mallimalai, Serulakkur 

and Bhimapuram, 4 villages situated in Kilaippadainadu in the Chandragiri- rajya and Vilai mankondan in Padaivittu- sirmai 

4.

THE TIRUMALA TEMPLE 

Of these, Durgasamudram was subsequently converted from a devadana village into a tiruppani-puram, i.e., a village supporting the public works, to wit, the construction of gopurams and mantapams at Tirumala and Tirupati. 

The next royal personage of account is Krishnadevaraya. Like Saluva Narasimha, he too had great devotion to Sri Venkatesa whom he regarded as his Patron-God, displayed through gifts of villages, jewels and vessels, besides offerings of 30,000 pagodas of gold, during his frequent visits to this holy shrine. The villages which he endowed in conjunction with his two queens, Tirumaladevi and Chinnaji devi, comprise half the village of Kadaikkuttanpadi in Ulmandalam, and Tallapakam, Mudiyur, Pirati- Kulattur, Darattur, Chatrapadi and Turiayur in Pura-Mandalam. 

In the reign of Achyutaraya, his queen Varadajideviamman granted in Saka 1436 six villages to the temple, viz., Chinna-Madappulur and Muttukur in Gandikota-sima; Poliva, Valli and Mangamur in the Kondavi-sima; and Paindapalli and Narayanapurapparru. Achyutaraya's general Virappannan gave lands and villages, and also presented money on several occasions for the merit of the kings, as, c.g., Pachikalapadu in Gandikota-sima in Saka 1458. Gollapall was the gift of Yandalur-Venkatadriayyan, son of Tirumala-Josyar. 

In the reign of Sadasivaraya, the temple was the recipient of more than half a dozen villages from his subordinates, though no direct gift of his is available. In this reign, Aliya- Ramaraya's gift of Paduppattu probably served as a stimulus to others from Sadasiva's Mahapradhana. In Saka 1479, the Raja of Travancore granted half the village of Kulayapattam on the bank of Tamraparni river, for the merit of Vitthalarajayyan (No. 147~G.T.) In the reign of Venkatapatiraya, his general Hanumayyar alias Annamgar endowed the temple in Saka 1528 for the merit of king Venkatapatiraya and his queen Krishnaji-amman with Annamgar-palaiyam wherein the excavation of three irrigation channels had been provided by him. 

The permanent conduct of the several festivals and rites established in the temples depended on the facilities for irrigation provided in the villages endowed for the purpose and therefore the greater the attention paid to these facilities the greater the security of the festival. It was therefore the concern of the donor as well as of the authorities of the temple to look to the irrigation sources in the villages and keep them in constant repair. This indirectly benefited the cultivator of the soil who could not single-handed create these improve- ments by himself but would gladly endeavour to extend his helping hand to them, and thus it tended to his prosperity as well, besides that of the temples 

296 

THE EPIGRAPHS OF TIRUMALA TEMPLE 

Thanks to the precepts of the Sastras and Agamas for the institution of festivals and rites in temples, and thanks to the devoted followers of these injunctions who established them and provided for their permanent conduct through endowments of villages and lands and created irrigation facilities therein, not only the needs of the temples had been supplied and their prosperity ensured through these means directly, but the cultivators of the soil had also been benefited indirectly and impetus given to intensive cultivation tending to the economic prosperity of the people in general and to the political stability of the Hindu State.

17. SOPANA MARGA OR FLIGHT OF STEPS. 

A long Telugu stanza in the Sisamalika metre, composed of 41 lines and engraved separately in Telugu, Tamil and Grantha characters on the walls of a small shrine dedicated to Sri Venkatesvara at the foot of the hill alongside of the pathway leading uphill, recounts in glowing terms deeds of valour and acts of piety performed by Matla Kumara-Ananta, son of Matla Tiruvengala- natha and Chennamamba. His charitable services at Tirupati, among others by which he pleased God Venkatachalapati, comprise the Sopana-marga and Agra-gopura. Most probably this Sopana-marga refers to the flight of stone-steps forming the pathway comencing from the foot of the hill usually called Alipiri (i.e. Adipadi, the bottom or lowest step) and extending on the side of the hill in a zigzag course upto the small tower commonly known as the Gali-gopuram (i.e. air-tower or towar-on-high) which stands on the summit of the front hill prominently visible on the plain country for a distance of about 8 to 10 miles. And the Agra-gopura is in all likelihood this Gali-gopuram, This flight of stone-steps is at the present time the only passage leading uphill to Tirumala from Tirupati. We may therefore take the expression Sopana- marga to convey the idea of an original formation of the pathway on the side of the front hill alone upto the Gali-gopuram by Matla Anantaraja. It is said that in earlier times the pathway from Tirupati lay by the side of the Kapila- tirtham up the hill and over it as far as the Gali-gopuram. Matla Anantaraja's work therefore seems to have been the formation of the present pathway from Alipiri, instead of from Kapila-tirtham. Probably both the new and the old pathways upto the Gali-gopuram were used by the pilgrims for some time later and subsequently the present one became the only passage, while the older one was altogether given up. The flight of steps must have been provided in or before Saka 1550 in which year this inscription is dated. It cannot be taken that a new pathway was laid throughout the whole length upto the temple above, for we are sure that such a path existed already and a good number of devotees went up to Tirumala and worshipped the deity. 

297 

THE TIRUMALA TEMPLE 

Further we have in No. 53 –T.T. dated in Saka 1387, i.e., more than a century and a half earlier, a reference to another flight of steps in the mile of the course reaching to Tirumala called molankal-murippan-padi (i.e., steps paining the knee in their ascent, or mokala-metlu as they are called in Telugu meaning, steps of the height of the knee-knee-high steps) commencing from the deep gorge. As such there is no doubt as to the existence of a kind of pathway with flights of steps at different levels on the sides of the several hills forming the Tirumala or the Holy-Hill. 

18. THANNIR - PANDAL (WATER-SHEDS) 

Water-sheds are an absolute necessity both in Tirupati and on the way to Tirumala, where there is a lack of adequate supply of fresh water easily available to the pilgrim population visting the place. We have a reference to a water-shed in a record of the 14th century (No. 195–T.T.) in which dis- cretion was allowed to the managers of the temple to utilise any balance, left after meeting certain specific charges from the endowment concerned, for the institution of a water-shed, a flower-garden and other acts of charity at Tirumala in the name of the donor, Singaya Dannayakkar. In No. 53-T.T. Saluva Parvataraja, son of Saluvaraja, provided for the maintenance of a water-shed which he established in the mulankal-murippan mantapam built by him on the way to Tirumala and also for the execution of repairs to the mantapam, both of them being placed under the supervision of one Goppayyan. During the time of festivals special arrangements were required to be made for supplying water in sufficiently large quantities to the devotees flocking to the place on those occasions. A typical arrangement comes to our notice in No. 142-G.T. wherein the donor, a temple-accountant by name Vighne- swara Sriraman, provided for the payment from the temple-treasury of 3 panam monthly as salary for the permanent man who supplied water from the water- shed together with the issue of a portion of the food offered to the deity and a special payment of 40 panam as wages for the persons temporarily engaged for distributing water at the water-shed during the 10 days of the purattasi tirunal. Srinivasan, the son of another temple-accountant Tiruvenkata- mudiyan, deposited in Saka 1446 in the temple-treasury 700 panam which was required to be invested for increasing the irrigation sources in the devadana villages and, from the produce yielded thereby, the temple authorities bound themselves to maintain a water-shed in the mantapam built in a garden near Sri Govindaraja's temple, paying 6 panam as salary for the water-man and supplying ginger, etc., for flavouring the water, as also oil for the lamp to be kept lighted in the mantapam, and mud pots for distributing water, to- gether with the execution of repairs to the said mantapam (No.109—G.T.). 

298 

THE EPIGRAPHS OF TIRumala temMPLE 

A water shed was located at some spot on the way in the course of the "Short-ascent", Sirettam (Chittekkudu in Telugu), by Sriman Mahamanda- lesvara Timmaraja Salakaraja in Saka 1455 for the maintenance of which he paid 600 panam into the temple-treasury and made the temple authorities responsible for it .(No. 262-G.T.) 

19. RAMANUJA KUTAM OR FEEDING HOUSES. 

It has been the practice in this temple to distribute a portion of the offered food freely among devotees as His prasadam, and a number of donors had stipulated for such distribution being effected from out of the offerings they made to the deity. A number of epigraphs have this arrangement for dis- tribution embodied in them, the responsibility for being placed with and taken up by the Sthanattar, i.e., managers of the temple. 

The earliest reference to feeding occurs in No. 220 G.T. belonging to the earlier part of the 10th century, wherein the donor Irungolakkon alias Gunavan Aparajitan arranged for the daily issue of two vattil of Prasadam to two Brahmanas. A later arrangement occurs in No.195-T.T. a record of the 14th century, in which the duty of feeding 32 Srivaishnavas in the Sitakara- gandanmatham was laid upon the temple-managers who were authorised by Singaya-Dannayaka, the donor, to utilise a portion of the produce from Singananallur alias Pongalur, situated in flatur-nadu, a sarvamanya village granted for the purpose. 

The original credit for instituting separate Ramanujkutam for free feeding house with an organization of its own, quite unconnected with the authorities of the temple, belongs to Saluva Narasimhadeva Maharaya, son of Saluva Gundadeva Maharaja, who built Ramanujakutams both at Tirumala and at Tirupati and placed them under the management of Kandadai Ramanujay- yangar. The exact date of their institution is not explicitly mentioned, but innumerable reference to them abound, dating from Saka 1378 corresponding to the cyclic year Dhatu to the year Chitrabhanu corresponding probably to Saka 1444. The one at Tirumala was located in the Sannidhi street, while the other in Tirupati was probably within the temple premises. 

The next instance of a Ramanujakutam is the one referred to as having been established by Periya-Obala-Nayakar who made over to it his share, as donor of the one nali of the Paledu-Kulambu offered to Sri Venkatesvara daily during the Ardhayamam or the early hours of the night (No. 386–T.T. dated in Saka 1435).

THE TIRUMALA TEMPLE 

From the references made in Nos. 201, 202 and 203—T.T. it appears that king Krishnaraya also instituted for the Brahmanas a Satram at Tirumala for which his two queens and himself provided for the delivery of their respec- tive shares of the food and puddings arranged to be offered to God Tiruvenkata- of their visit to the temple while returning to his capital at Vijayanagara after having vanquished Prataparudra Gajapati, pursued him as far as Kondavidu and also captured Udayagiri. There is a further reference made to this Satram in No.246--T.T. dated in Saka 1445, but this time it was not for adding to its receipts. 

In Saka 1438 (180-T.T.) Ellappa-Nayaka endowed the temple with three villages for the purpose of offering 8 tirupponakam daily to Sri Venkatesa, for the merit of king Krishnaraya; but as regards the distribution of the offered food he permitted the Sthanattar to utilise it for the Ramanujakutam, probably that of Saluva Narasimha. This Ellappa-nayaka is again mentioned in a fragmentary record (No. 291-T.T.) as making a gift for some Satram being different from the above Ramanujakutam. 

Rayasam Kondamarasayya, son of Timmarasayyangar, also established a Satram at Tirumala which was granted a fourth of the donor's quarter share from the 16 tirupponakam and other edibles arranged by him in Saka 1441 to be offered daily to the deity (No. 77—T.T.) 

A fragmentary record (No.317—T.T.) mentions Achyutaraya Maharayar's Satram, Achyutaraya-puram and Achyuta-perumal. We know from other records that Achyutaraya-puram formed a suburb of Tirupati and it is quite likely that the Satram of Achyutaraya was situated in that particular suburb to the north of Tirupati. 

Matla Kumara-Anantaraja is seen to have been a great benefactor, for his charities were not only varied and extensive but also took different forms on different occasions at several holy places (Nos.269 and 270-G.T.). Among them the institution of Anna-satrams feeding-houses in several places situated on the way from Ramesvaram to the Himalayas for the convenience of the pilgrims on foot formed a particular kind of meritorious service rendered by him. 

Thus the increase of festivals attracted greater number of pilgrims for whose gratification further additions were being made from time to time and for whose convenience facilities as regards boarding and lodging are seen to have been arranged by the rulers themselves primarily, though it might have been done at the instance of some of the prominent Vaishnava preceptors

THE EPIGRAPHS OF TIRUMALA TEMPLE 

and devotees of Sri Venkatesvara. And these meritorious services have con- tributed to enhance the original fame and insure the continued prosperity of the temples. 

20. TEMPLES, THEIR EXTENSION AND REPAIRS. 

The epigraphs are the main source for our information about extensions and repairs of the main temple. 

The case of a Tiruvilankoyil (Balalayam) Karmarchanai (special worship) followed by the consecration of a silver image designated Manavala-Perumal (the Beautiful God) comes to notice from epígraphs Nos. 18 and 19 T.T. which are both of them dated in the 14th year of the reign of Koppatra-Mahendra- Panmar. 

In Saka 1339 a Mukhamantapam was added to the central shrine at Tirumala, the entire building from the central shrine at Tirumala, the entire building from the stone besement (kuradu) upto the roof and bent caves (stupi) and crest including the Madhavadasar-Tirumutti-nalandal foming the charity of the minister Mallanna or Sri Madhavadasar of Chandragiri, and it was designated Tirumahamani-mantapam (No. 88-T.T.). 

In Saka 1404 the Sthanattar undertook the construction of a mantapam along with gopurams for the merit of Saluva Narasimha. Its situation is not mentioned, but it is likely that it was somewhere at Tirumala. Saluva Nara- simha is further credited with the construction of mantapams on the bank of the Tirukkoneri and one in the midst of it, the Niralimantapam or Vasanta- mantapam as it is called in No. 54-T.T., which served on occasions of the floating festival. Two other mantapams come to notice from No. 266—T.T- and they are called Periya-tirumantapam and Tiruvenkatanathan-mantapam. 

No. 248-T.T. mentions another gopuram at Tirumala whose construction had been undertaken by the Sthanattar some time prior to Saka 1404, for the merit of Saluva Narasimha who confirmed in that year his previous grant of Durgasamudram in Kudavur-nadu made previously in the cyclic year Nandana on the Utthana-dvadasi day, corresponding to Saka 1394 (13—10—1472 A.D.). This village was dedicated as Tiruppanipuram and was registered in the name of and held by the Pillaitiruppani-Bhandarattar who were authorised to utilise its income for the construction of the gopurams at Tirumala and Tirupati as well as the Narasimharaya-mantpam which they had undertaken. The Agra-gopura mentioned in Nos. 269 and 270- G.T. as the work of Matla Kumara-Anantaraja denotes_the_tower on the summit of the front hill, commonly known as the Gali-gopuram.) 

301 

THE TIRUMALA TEMPLE 

Saluva Mangideva Maharaja is recorded in Nos. 237 and 238–T.T. dated in Saka 1281 (corresponding to the 6th of July 1352 A.D.) to have covered the Vimanam or the tower of the central shrine with gilded plate and to have also placed a gilded Kalasam over it, so as to enhance the grandeur of the temple. In course of time the Kalasam wore out and a fresh one was fixed in the Kaliyuga year 5010 (1909 A.D.) (No. 242-T.T.) by the late Bavaji Rama -lakshmanadasji, a brother-disciple of the present Vicharanakarta of the Devasthanams. 

The prominent towers in Tirupati are the work of Matla Kumara-Ananta- raja. The Periya-tirugopuram, referred to in No. 22-G.T. as the place where the stationary image of Chakrattalvar was installed, different from 

the big tower standing about 200 yards to the east of the temple premises. This latter big gopuram bears an inscription in Telugu of Matla Anantaraja recording its construction by him for the merit of his father and mother whose figures are carved with names below them on the left side (Nos. 281 and 282 -G.T.). Another tower, now commonly called the Kotta-gopuram (the new tower) bears on its inner side a Telugu inscription stating that it was constructed by Matla Anantaraja. This is the second tower from the foot of the hill, past the bigger ruined tower just at the foot. 

21. JIYAR MATHAM. 

The head of a local Matham, established in Tirupati and Tirumala, and generally known as the Jiyar-matham and Jiyyangar-matham, has long bean a functionary of the temple. The earliest person that we meet with is Mullai Tiruvenkata Jiyar who, as the agent of Harihara II of the First Vijayanagara dynasty, arranged for the celebration of the Masi-tirunal in Saka 1309 (=1387 A.D.) in the king's name through the payment of 100 panam derived from the village of Pungodu granted by Harihara for the purpose (No. 103– T.T.). Mullai Tiruvenkata Jiyar's dates range from Saka 1309 to 1314, and he is mentioned as the manager of the Arisanalayan-nandavanam (flower- garden) (Nos. 57 and 43-T.T.). One of his successors, viz., Emperu- manar Jiyar, with dates Saka 1367 to 1415, is seen to have been styled Koyil- Kelvi, a functionary whose assent to the conduct of the religious functions in the temple was imperative, and he was the supervisor of the Pankayach- chelli-nandavanam (Nos. 106, 48, 15 and 369-T.T. and 190 and 411–G.T.). His service in the temple extended over a period of 50 years from about 1445 to 1493 A.D. His immediate successor was Ramanuja Jiyar, the manager of the Pankayachchelli-nandavanam (No. 333-T.T. of Saka 1414, Ananda, 

302 

THE EPIGRAPHS OF TIRUMALA' TEMPLE 

equivalent to 2nd April 1494 A.D.). He was succeeded by Anusundhanam Tiruvenkata Jiyar of the Tiruvenkatanathan-nandavanam with dates Saka 1426 to 1442 (1504 to 1520 A.D.) falling into the reign of Krishnaraya. In some of the records he also appears as the manager of the Perarulalan-nandavanam. 

In No. 292-G.T. he is styled Periya Koyil-kelvi and this implies the exis- tence of another Koyil-kelvi as his junior. In the Saka year 1442, current with Vikrama, he was succeeded by Koyil-Kelvi Ramanuja Jiyar, the manager of the Pankayachchelli-nandavanam, who was entitled Srimat Vedamarga--pra- tishthapancharya and Paramahamsa-parivrajakacharya. His two records Nos. 15-G.T. and 598-T.T. are dated respectively in Saka 1442 and 1449 during the reign of Krishnaraya. The successor of this Ramanuja Jiyar was Vada-Tiruvenkata Jiyar of the Pankayachchelli-nandavanam, represented by No.472-T.T. dated in Saka 1457, Manmatha(=7—7-1535 A.D.). During the same year he was succeeded by Koyil-kelvi Yatiraja Jiyar who looked after the [perarulalan-nandavanam and also the perarulalan-matham (Nos.324 G.T. and 389 and 410-T.T.), and this Yatiraja Jiyar continued as the head of the matham for about six or seven years upto Saka 1463, Plava (=1541 A.D.) He is stated to have been the disciple of Algaiyamanavala Jiyar. The headship of the matham passed to Vanamamalai Jiyar, the head of the Alagiyamanavalan- matham and he occupied it for about half a dozen years from Saka 1463 to 1468 (=1541 to 1546 A.D.)(Nos. 509 and 402-T.T.). This Vanamamalai Jiyar was the disciple of Ramanuja Jiyar, possibly the Koyil-kelvi Ramanuja Jiyar of the Pankayachchelli-nandavanam noticed above. In No. 402- T. T. of Saka 1468 his name appears as Vanamalai Ramanuja Jiyar, in accordence with the practice obtaining in this matham of suffixing "Ramanuja” to the personal name of its head. Annan-Ramanuja" Jiyar who in Saka 1515, Vijaya (=17—1—1954A.D.), made a gift of the village of Timmanayakapuram in Kondavidu-sima and excavated an irrigation channel in the village of Tottalam sirmai (probably the Tottalam village in the Vellore taluk of the same district) (No. 413-G.T.). 

An insight into the origin of this matham is afforded No. 354-T.T.dated in the 3rd year of the reign of Sriranganatha Yadavaraya. It appears that a religious order known as the Siyars, who were Desantaris, i.e., immigrants from another locality, was attached to these Nandavanams and mathams and that one of them known as the Jiyar was vested with the management of these establishments. At the time of the record a certain Siyan and the Jiyar had handed over these mathams and nandavanams latter thereby acquired the right to their management. But it was, however, stipulated that the Siyan might reside in the matham till the end of the life of the Jiyar and that after 

303 

THE TIRUMALA TEMPLE 

him the properties should revert to the Dannayakkar, i.e., Singaya-Dannayakkar whereupon the Sthanattar should appoint a Desantari for service in the temple of Tiruvenkatamudaiyan. It is also recorded that, according to an old docu- ment engraved on stone which laid down the Desantari's custom, the newly appointed Jiyar had to pay a sum of 400 panam into the Sri-Bhandaram as capital towards offerings, for his being enabled to utilise the living settled for him. 

This matham at Tirumala in which the Desantaris were allowed to reside and to which the Arisanalayan-nandavanam and the Vansatha-kopan-nanda- vanam were attached, as noticed from No. 354- T.T., is probably the same matham that is mentioned in Nos. 434 and 676-T.T. as having been constructed by Sriman Mahapradhani Immadi-Rahuttarayan Singaya-Dannayakkan Sitakaragandan. The date of No 354, viz., the 3rd year of Sriranganatha Yadavaraya, corresponded to Saka 1260, Bahudhanya (=1338–39 A.D.), the first year of his reign being reckoned to have commenced in Saka 1258, Dhatu (1336-37 A.D.). 

Generally these Jiyars gave a visible expression to their piety and religio- sity through the increase they brought about in the matter of festivals in the temples by means of endowments either in the form of lands and villages or in cash. Their modern representatives are still attached to the temple of Sri Venkatesa and claim to belong to the direct line of disciples from Udaiyavar- Ramanuja, the great Srivaishnava acharya. This local matham is also stated to be the earliest one, as having been personally established by Sri Ramanuja in Saka 980, Hevalambi (~1057-58 A.D.), at Tirumala in front of the Anjaneya shrine. The Parampara maintained in it seems to repeat the names Tiruvenkata Jiyar, Sathakopa Jiyar and Sriranga-Ramanuja Jiyar, 

Two other members of the list may also be identified, viz., our Mullaj Tiruvenkata Jiyar and his successor Emperumanar Jiyar with Tiruvenkata- Ramanuja Jiyar and Emperumanar Jiyar mentioned in the list of the matham as the fourth and fifth Jiyars in succession to Sri Ramanuja. In the line of succession made out from the epigraphs of our collection may be noticed Vanamamalai Jiyar, the founder of the Vanamamalai or Totadri-matham in the Tinnevelly district. Tradition speaks of him that he first accepted the asramam of the sanyasi at Tirupati, evidently at the hands of Ramanuja Jiyar, sometime head of the local matham during the reign of Krishnaraya, moved to the south for a while, founded a new matham named after himself at Srivara- mangai or the modern Nanguneri, returned to Tirupati after a time and spent his last days in the service of this temple. This is borne out by the long interval 

304 

THE EPIGRAPHS OF- TIRUMALA TEMPLE 

of over two decades that elapsed between the headship of the guru Ramanuja Jiyar during the Saka years 1442 to 1449 (=1520 to 1527 A.D.) and that of the disciple Vanamamalai Jiyar in the years Saka 1463 and 1468 (=1541 and 1546 A.D. )during the reign of Sadasivaraya. Though the founder of the Vanamamalai-matham originally belonged to this local Jiyar-matham, no connection exists between them at present and they are now two independent units.
