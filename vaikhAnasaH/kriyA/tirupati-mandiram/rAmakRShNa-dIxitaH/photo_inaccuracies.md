The numbers signifies the major differences between the svayamvyakta salagrama divya archa murthy at Tirumala Hill Shrine and the above picture, which is claimed to be the original one shot in 1955! 

(These differences what I meant are regarding physical appearance. It is not to be mistaken) 

Tirumala Hill Shrine needs no introduction, the abode of Lord Venkateswara, which is extolled by the ancient Rigveda 10.155.1. In the Hill Shrine, all ancient practices are observed with strict adherence, beyond any doubt. The direct evidence is the glory and divinity of our Lord, where each and every one of us might have innumerable divine experiences with the Mahatyam of Lord Srinivasa. 

Vaikhanasa Agama explains that the reason for the divinity in the Archa Murthy is due to three points,  
The way of Righteous life lead by the Archakas,  
The rules (Yama, Niyama etc.,) followed by Archakas which are binding on them by ancient scriptures and 
thirdly, the power of Archavatara Murthy inside the Garbhagriham, 

but at Tirumala the Lord is self manifested by his own will and HE appeared on the earth, only to save his devotees from the ill effects of Kali Yuga. 

Never in the history of Tirumala temple, does the Archa Murthy roopam of Lord is photographed by either Britishers or any other TTD Officials. Whatever pictures that are being circulated in general are just replicas of the self manifested murthy at Tirumala. Photography was strictly prohibited near the Sanctum, now and then and the claims of the original photographs of Srivaru are not true. "Only two times Lord's Dhruva Beram is photographed." It is totally FALSE and as a member of the ancient Vaikhanasa Archaka Community of Tirumala, also having been associated with Lord Srinivasa for, generations to generations, over 5000 years, I can authoritatively reiterate that Photography is NOT permitted then and now under any circumstances. THIS IS THE REAL TRUTH. 

Then coming to the below Photograph, which is being popularly circulated as an Original Photograph is originally from a Studio Set made to picturise the Mahatyam of Lord Venkateswara. Now, I wish to present some of the differences, that one can find in the present photograph and the Svayam vyakta Divya Archa Murthy of Srivaru inside Sanctum, to create an awareness among all the devotees of Srivaru. 

## DIFFERENCES with Description 

1. Doors of the Sanctum - 
   In the Photo, we can see two big doors fixed for Srivari Garbhagriham. But in actuality there are no doors at present which were removed, due to many of reasons (Rahasyams cannot be revealed), over 200 years before approximately. So here in the photo, which claims original, the doors are wrongly shown. 
2. Hanging Lamps 
   In the Photo, we can find two big lamps hanging on both the sides. These hanging lamps are not part of the original sanctum before 1982. In the tenure of Sri PVRK Prasad, to enhance the lighting inside sanctum for better vision of Lord's Archa Rupam, the additional lamps are introduced, in due consultation with the then Vaikhanasa Archakas. Before that the light inside Garbhalayam, is from the two big Akhanda Deepams, situated diagonally facing the Mulavirat, on both the sides. Also the lamps design is quite different from the one that is shown in the Photo here. 
3. The Wall of the Garbhalayam behind Mulavirat Koil Alwar Tirumanjanam is an ancient ritual meant for cleaning the Tirumala Temple completely from the Sanctum to the Mahadwaram, before 4 main festivals of the temple. It was usually performed on a Tuesday, before the upcoming festivals like Ugadi Asthanam (March/April), Anivara Asthanam (July), Brahmotsavams (September/October), Vaikunta Ekadasi (December/January). Tuesday is selected because during this festival, Darsan remain closed from 5:30 AM to 12 Noon due to overall cleaning process. Since the temple is closed for such a long duration, the day is selected as Tuesday as on Tuesday, being a week day, the Pilgrim influx is minimum. During this festval, after thoroughly wiping the walls of the Sanctum, a Herbal Paste (A mixture of 6 herbs) is applied to the walls of the sanctum and after applying this naste the color of the walls are seen in pale orange color. But here in the Photo the Wall is clearly visible and it is seen black in color which is not true. 
4. Kantabharanam - Necklace  
   In the Photo, we can see a prominent gold necklace called 'Chinna Kanti'. In actuality, this Chinna Kanti, is not visible with such a clarity. And also there is no gap between Jewel and neck of the Archa bimbam. In actuality, the beautiful neck of the Lord is clearly visible for Darsan. Also many of 
4. Kantabharanam - Necklace 
   In the Photo, we can see a prominent gold necklace called 'Chinna Kanti'. In actuality, this Chinna Kanti, is not visible with such a clarity. And also there is no gap between Jewel and neck of the Archa bimbam. In actuality, the beautiful neck of the Lord is clearly visible for Darsan. Also many of the abharanams are of recent origin, to be precise after 1960's. 
5. The Vastram behind Lord's Mulavirat (Pink)
   There is a vastram seen in the photo to the back of Mulaberam. Here at Tirumala, during the Samarpana to Mulavirat, there is no practice of adorning a vastram at the back of Mulavirat as in the Utsava Muthy Samarpana. The practice of Alankaram, that we follow, during Samarpana on Fridays, is the standard procedure set by our ancestors, which is minimum 300-400 years old. 
6. Makara Thoranam  
   Design of the Makara Thoranam, which is depicted in the photo doesnot matches the Makara Thoranam originally situated in Srivari Garbhagriham. It has many intricate carvings with beautiful design and bends, consecrated in the year 20-03-1946, during Asta Bandhana Maha Samprokshanam. The photo depicts depicts something moulded with plaster of paris which doesnot matches the beauty of Srivari Makara Thoranam. Also the bottom part of the Makara Thoranam is not a gold one and is not visible to devotees, due to the two Simhasanams, covering the view of the bottom part of the Makara Thoranam. 
7. The Pedestal lamps on both the sides  
   The two big Akhanda Deepams as already stated are not visible as they are situated inside the sanctum. There is no practice of placing pedestal akhanda deepams infront of the Lord, as depicted in the Photo. 
8. The tall Patadgraha Patra  
   To offer Worship to Lord Venkateswara, Gold Utensils Pancha Patra are used inside sanctum. Here in the picture we can see Patadgraha Patra, placed in wrong spot and even the design is not matching with the original one. There is also no Peetam for this Patra. 
9. Bhoga Srinivasa Murthy  
   Bhoga Srinivasa Murthy is called 'kaUtuka bEram' in Vaikhanasa Agama. Bhoga Srinivasa is a Silver icon presented to Tirumala temple in the year 614 A.D. by the Pallava Princess Samavai Perundevi. Here in the photo the photo doesnot matches the Makara Thoranam originally situated in Srivari Garbhagriham. It has many intricate carvings with beautiful design and bends, consecrated in the year 20-03-1946, during Asta Bandhana Maha Samprokshanam. The photo depicts depicts something moulded with plaster of paris which doesnot matches the beauty of Srivari Makara Thoranam. Also the bottom part of the Makara Thoranam is not a gold one and is not visible to devotees, due to the two Simhasanams, covering the view of the bottom part of the Makara Thoranam. 
7. The Pedestal lamps on both the sides   
   The two big Akhanda Deepams as already stated are not visible as they are situated inside the sanctum. There is no practice of placing pedestal akhanda deepams infront of the Lord, as depicted in the Photo. 
8. The tall Patadgraha Patra   
   To offer Worship to Lord Venkateswara, Gold Utensils. Pancha Patra are used inside sanctum. Here in the picture we can see Patadgraha Patra, placed in wrong spot and even the design is not matching with the original one. There is also no Peetam for this Patra. 
9. Bhoga Srinivasa Murthy   
   Bhoga Srinivasa Murthy is called 'kaUtuka bEram' in Vaikhanasa Agama. Bhoga Srinivasa is a Silver icon presented to Tirumala temple in the year 614 A.D. by the Pallava Princess Samavai Perundevi. Here in the photo, the icon of Bhoga Srinivasa is wrongly placed to the extreme left of Mulavirat, where as actually He is placed in the Simhasanam meant, always maintaining the contact with Mulaberam as prescribed in Agamas. Also if you zoomin the image, there is no vastram seen on the Tirumeni of Bhoga Srinivasa, which is wrongly depicted. 
10. Tulasi Patra Haram and the other Harams.  
    Here in the Photo, the Tulasi Patra Haram (A gold garland of 108 Tulasi Leaves) and the other harams like Lakshmi Haram are depicted very prominently, and also with big sized leaves and pendants, which is not the case inside Sanctum. They are found on the holy Tirumeni of Lord Srinivasa, with wonderful design. If this socalled original photo is such an ancient one shot by Britishers, then most of these Abharanams are of recent origin, except for Lakshmi Haram.
