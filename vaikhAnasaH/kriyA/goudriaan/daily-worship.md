## INTRODUCTION

The Vaikhānasas are a group of South Indian Vişnuite Brahmans who are traditionally engaged in conducting worship in temples. Various temples in Tamilnad and Andhra Pradesh had (or have) their worship organized according to the Vaikhānasa method and with officiants belonging to the Vaikhanasa sect.[^1]

[^1]:
     M. Seshagiri Shastri, Report on a search for Sanskrit and Tamil manuse pts, vol. 2 (for the years 1893-94) (Madras, 1899), p. 9; Farquhar, Outine of the religious literature of India (London, 1920), p. 181f., 321 (cited by W. Eggers, Das Dharmasūtra der Vaikhānasas, Thesis Göttingen, 1929, p. 15).

The fact is noteworthy that the Vaikhanasa sect can trace its origin up to a period in which the Vedic religion of sacrifice still occupied the main position in Brāhmanic circles of India. Thus it is not surprising that the traditions of the sect show a great number of ancient (often, Vedic) elements, persistently preserved also in later periods when other ideas and cult methods had arisen. This is not to say, however, that the Vaikhanasas had not the bulk of their philosophy and ritual in common with other Vişnuite, and sometimes also Šivaite, circles.[^2]

[^2]:
     The philosophical ideas of the Vaikhānasas in the main resemble those of the Śrīvaişnavas (R. Parthasarathi Bhattacharya, in the Introduction to Bhrgu, Kriyā dhikāra). The ritual of the Śrīvaişnavas also shows many points of resemblance. See the description by K. Rangachari, The Sri Vaishnava Brahmans (Madras, 1931). An accurate description of South Indian Śaiva ritual is found in the work of C. G. Diehl, Instrument and Purpose (Lund, 1956). Two other important studies in the field are: R. V. Joshi, Le rituel de la dévotion Krsnaite (Pondichéry, 1959), and Fausta Nowotny, "Das Pūjāvidhinirūpaṇa des Trimalla", Indo-Iranian Journal, Vol. 1 (1957), pp. 109-154.-It should be emphasized here that the present study only aims at a comparative presentation of the ritual of the Vaikhānasas, and thus is limited.

The present study attempts to provide a survey of the central aspect of Vaikhanasa tradition: the daily worship of Vişnu in the temple. The Vaikhanasa temple cult is explained in the first place by the hand-books written, according to tradition[^3], by the four seers Atri, Bhrgu, Kāśyapa, and Marici. These handbooks, which may date back about a millennium or more, all give a detailed description of daily worship to be performed by the *arcaka *or temple priest. But these are not the only literary sources for the subject-matter. Firstly, a more simple, shorter, and certainly older description of domestic worship is found in the* Vaikhanasa Grhyasūtra *4,12. To this chapter, several scholars have directed their attention[^4]. By a mutual comparison the dependence of the four handbooks on the method given in this chapter becomes clear. On the other hand, room should be left for the possibility that temple worship in a manner similar to that described in the four handbooks existed already in the time of the *Vaikhanasa Grhyasūtra.* The chapter in this *Sūtra*, then, could have been epitomized from it and given a place in this Vedic text, because the house worship of images was accepted earlier by orthodox Brahmans than the temple worship. For house worship, the *Atri Samhita* (one of the four handbooks), ch. 81, gives a description very similar to that in the* Vaikhanasa Grhyasútra*. Thus the domestic worship enjoined by the Sūtra remained in vogue for a long time afterwards.

     E.g., Marici, Vimānārcanākalpa, ch. 97.

     W. Caland, in the translation of the Vaikhanasa Grhyasútra ( = Bibl. Indica, 251) (Calcutta, 1929);
     P. N. U. Harting, Selections from the *Baudhāyana Grhyaparisiṣṭasūtra*, Thesis Utrecht (1922), 
    Appendix 1; P. V. Kane, *History of Dharmaśāstra,* Vol. II, Part 2 (Poona, 1941), p. 901.

After the period of these handbooks (Samhitās) named after the four seers, later authorities writing sometimes under their own names sometimes under the name of one of the four seers, but always professing themselves to belong to the tradition of one of the four Samhitas, continued to write on the subject. They changed the sequence of the details of the ritual, systematized and introduced new elements. These innovations are laid down in monographs and commentaries like the *Arcanakhanda *and the *Arcanasārasamgraha*; they are the basis for daily worship in Vaikhanasa temples as performed up till the present day. They might be compared with the Śivaite *paddhatis *of *Aghoraśivācārya*, *Somaśambhu *and others; perhaps they have originated in the same period or from the same period on (I express myself very carefully).

In the following pages, I shall mainly restrict myself to the above-mentioned *Samhitās *of the four seers, and try to give a systematic, comparative study of their rules about temple worship.

These Samhitās are chiefly represented by the following texts (with the abbreviations used in this study):

I.* Atrisamhitā:** Samūrtārcaṇādhikaraṇa,*** ch. 40, ed. P. Raghunath Chakravarti Bhattacharya and M. Ramakrishna Kavi (= Śrī Venkatesvara Oriental Series, no. 6) (Tirupati, 1943) = A.

II. *Bhrgusamhitā:*

(**a)* Khilādhikāra*,** ch. 20, ed. R. Pārthasarathi Bhattacharya (Tirupati, 1961) = BKh. This text is by no means, as its title seems to imply, an "appendix", but a full-fledged handbook of Vaikhānasa ritual, and probably older than the *Kriyādhikāra *from the same school, because it is repeatedly quoted in the *Kriyādhikāra* (and also in the *Yajñādhikāra*).

(**b) *Kriyādhikāra***, ch. 9, ed. R. Pārthasarathi Bhattacharya (= Śrī Venkatesvara Oriental Series, No. 40) (Tirupati, 1953) = BK.

(**c) *Yajñādhikāra*,** ch. 32, ed. D. Rangacharya (= *Śrīvaikhanasagranthamālā*, No. 19) (Akulamannādu, 1931) = BY. This work is shorter and of less value than the other two of Bhrgu.

III.* Kāśyapasamhitā,* represented by ***Kāśyapajñānakāṇḍa* **(in prose), chs. 69 and 70, ed. R. Pārthasārathi Bhattacharya (= Śrī Venkatesvara Oriental Series, No. 12) (Tirupati, 1948) = K. Translation into English by T. Goudriaan, Kāśyapa's Book of Wisdom (= Disputationes Rhenotrajectinae, Vol. 10) (The Hague, 1965).

IV. *Marīcisamhitā*, represented by ***Vimānārcanakalpa*** (in prose), ch. 41 (Vaikhānasagranthamālā, No. 15) (1927) (in Telugu characters) = M. The same work was edited under the title* Vaikhānāsāgama* by K. Sambasiva Sastri (= *Trivandrum Sanskrit Series*, No. 121) (in Devanāgarī characters) = MD. (This edition has little value because it was done from only one, defective and deviating manuscript. The chapter on daily worship is found here as ch. 43.)

Thus, the Samhitās are represented in this survey by six texts: one from the schools of Atri, Kāśyapa, and Marīci, and three from the schools of Bhrgu. Except the works of Kāśyapa and Marīci, all are in* śloka* metre. These are, however, not the only ones ascribed to these seers. Thus, according to tradition[^5]Atri also wrote *Pūrva*- and *Uttaratantra*. I was, however, unable to consult them.

[^5]:
     Nṛsimha Vājapeyin, a Vaikhānasa author on ritual matters, cited by K. S. Sastri in the preface to the edition of Marīci, *Vaikhānāsāgama*, p. III.

Another text, the ***Prakīrņādhikāra ***ascribed to Bhrgu (see below), shows clear signs of being of a later date than the others.

Other sources:

Older: ***Vaikhānasa Grhyasūtra*** 4,12 (ed. W. Caland,* Vaikhānasa smārtasūtram (= Bibliotheca Indica)* (Calcutta, 1927) = V. This text was translated by the editor in the same series (Calcutta 1929).

Younger: (a) Bhrgu, ***Prakirnādhikāra,*** ch. 18 (ed. M. Ramakrishna Kavi, Madras, 1929) = BP.

(b) Kāśyapa,** *Arcanākhaṇḍa*,** a monograph on daily worship belonging to the school of Kāśyapa (MS. No. R 1606b in the Government Oriental MSS. Library of Madras; copy in the Utrecht University Library) = KA.

(c) "Bhatta",** *Arcanāsārasamgraha***, a commentary on the preceding work (MS. No. 1608a in the Government Oriental MSS. Library in Madras; copy in Utrecht University Library; Telugu characters) = KAV.

(d) Keśava,** *Arcanānavanīta***, a commentary on the Soprābhyāyī, a monograph on daily worship by Nṛsimha Vājapeyin. The *Arcanānavanīta *(= AN) has been edited as No. 18 of the Vaikhānasagranthamālā. For the present study a manuscript copy was used, which is preserved in the Utrecht University Library (Telugu characters). The *Arcanānavanīta *seems to belong to the school of Marīci, because Nṛsimha Vājapeyin in his *Pratiṣṭhāvidhidarpaṇam *calls Marīci his guru.

In all these sources, the sequence in which the elements of the ritual follow each other is not exactly the same. In the main, the sequence as given by Bhrgu has been followed, because this, in a few cases, means an easier arrangement.

The last source to be mentioned here is of a special character : ***Vaikhānasamantrapraśnam *(*daivikacatuṣṭayam*)**, ch. 8, 13 ff. (edited as No. 14 in the *Vaikhānāsagranthamālā*, 1926) (= VMP). 

In this work, all the formulas needed in the temple ritual are given in full when employed for the first time; and *pratikena *(by means of the first two or three words) when they recur for the second, third time etc. The chapters 1-4 of this work (which is also called *Vaikhānasasamhitā*) contains the formulas for the *Vaikhānasa Gṛhyasūtra*[^6]. The chapters 5-8 are intended to accompany the temple ritual as described in the handbooks. About the place of the *Mantrapraśna *in the tradition of daily worship something more will be said at the end of this article (p. 210).

[^6]:
      See W. Caland, "On the sacred books of the Vaikhānasas", Communications of the Royal Academy of Sciences, Division of Literature, Vol. 65 (Amsterdam, 1928), pp. 3 and 15; the same, translation of the *Vaikhānasa Smārtasūtra,* p. XI.

The complete vaikhanasa mantra prashna is called Prashnashtakam , comprising 8 prashnas. The *daivika chatustayam* , is only the last 4 ( 5-8 prashnas), and not the full complete work.  \
*Vaikhanasa Mantraprasnashtakam* is considered as the veda mantra samhita of this sampradaya.

The course of daily worship is divided in the present study into ninety two elements. Within it, the following main stages may be discerned, after the announcement and the daily observances of the priest before entering the temple (0 and 1):

A. Entering the temple (2-10)

B. Assistants' duties (fetching water etc.) (11-23)

C. Meditation or personal preparation of the priest (24-33)

D. Bathing the image (34-41)

E. Preparations, and worship of minor deities (42-47)

F. Invocation of Viṣṇu (48-56)

G. Worship of Vişņu (57-92).

In order to reach a really encompassing view of the daily worship according to the Samhitās, a partial repetition of some notes given in my thesis Kāśyapa's Book of Wisdom is unavoidable[^7].

### 00 Introductory

0.  Nearly all authorities agree in calling the daily worship arcanā or arcanam, sometimes nityārcanam. BK and a manuscript of A say *nitya pūjā*.

0.1 According to BK and BKh, there are two kinds of worship, *sākāra *and *nirākāra*, i.e. with and without an image of God. The nirākāra method means worship on a *sthaṇḍila *(altar of grains), in water, in the heart, or in the sun's orb. The articles of worship are prepared and given in the mind only. But *sākāra* worship is better, because (reason given by BKh) it is the cause of success in this life and the hereafter. It is lovely to the eye, mind and heart. It shows God constantly before one's eyes and stimulates intense devotion.[^8] 

[^8]:
     The same subject is found in a few sources also in ch. 1.

    *sarvādhāraṃ sanātanamaprameyamacintyaṃ nirguṇaṃ niṣkalaṃ,  \
kṣīre sarpiḥ, tile tailaṃ, puṣpe gandhaṃ, phale rasaṃ, kāṣṭhe agnimiva  \
sarvavyāpinaṃ paramātmānaṃ manasā saṅkalpya āvāhayet ||*

    *-*śrīvaikhānasa marīci vimānārcanākalpaṃ-31st paṭalaṃ

Sākāra worship is performed by two methods:

*nitya *(regular) and *naimittika *(on special occasions, such as calamities). This chapter concerns nitya only.

0.1.1 BK: Six times (*sandhi*) a day worship is performed. Of these, three are called upasandhi (minor occasions). Worship performed during these three is called *adhikāra*. "Special worship" (*viśeşārcanam*) is characterized by *ankurarpaṇam*[^9]* *at the beginning.

[^9]:
     This ceremony is usually treated in a separate chapter in the handbooks (e.g., Kāśyapa Jñānakāṇḍa, ch. 59).

0.1.2 BKh: *kāmya *worship (free act of worship done as an act of faith) is performed at special auspicious times. It takes place at noon. BK calls it *śraddhabhaktikriyā*.

0.2 The images (*bera* or *bimba*.[^10]) A, BK, BKh: there are three (movable) images. The kautuka or main movable image is the object of usual worship. Its place is in the centre. The *autsava *("festival image") is on its left (northern) side. The *snapana *("bathing image"), also called *ārca*, is on its right (southern) side. BK adds: the last two may be placed in a corner of the inner hall of the temple (*garbhālaya*) or in the front hall (*mukhamandapa*) or in the courtyard (antarāla). A, BK: if these three images cannot be created for financial or other reasons, worship may then be directed to the kautuka only.

[^10]:
     The word bera is mostly applied to the immovable image (dhruvabera), the word bimba to the movable image (kautukabimba). See below, 

0.2.1 According to BK, a special balibera ("image for tributes") may be placed to the north of the autsava.

0.2.2 The kautuka is used for regular worship. The autsava is used for the festival (utsava), but also for kāmya worship. The snapana is used, both for bathing, and for the appeasement of calamities (naimittikarcanam, BKh), and for the five-days-festival devoted especially to Vişņu.

0.2.3 Besides the images aforementioned, there is also the dhruva ("immovable") image of Vişņu (A, BK, BKh). BK: the dhruva should not be worshipped with flowers, water and unguents. There is a special method of worship for the immovable image (dhruvarcanam); this method is given by BK after the discussion of *nityārcanam*.[^11] The dhruva image represents the indivisible (nişkala), primeval aspect of Vişņu. Its worship is called abstract (anālamba) and only produces results in the hereafter. Its worship is thus only destined for those without karma. The kautuka image represents Vişņu's divisible (sakala) aspect; it is concrete (salamba), qualified (saguņa) and thus preferable.

[^11]:
     BK 9, 223-228; BP 19.

0.3 There is an analogy between Vedic fire worship and image worship (A, BK). BK: just as there are five fires and five prāņas (breaths), in the same way there are five images *(dhruva, kautuka, autsava, snapana, bali*). The three main fires are to be connected with the *dhruva, autsava, *and *bali *images. The *dhruva *= the *aupasana *fire. A says that after one's initiation, one may perform temple worship as well as fire worship.

0.4 The officiants are fully discussed in BP. The *ācārya *or *guru *("teacher") has the supervision of the rituals and invokes God to be present. He protects and teaches the dharma. The *arcaka *("worshipping priest") performs the actual worship. The *paricārakāh *("assistants") assist him. Some of them sweep, some light the lamps, others clean the dishes, fetch water, strew flowers, prepare incense, carry the materials, cook the grain offering, etc. All officiants must be *Vaikhānasas*. A non-Vaikhānasa is a *devalaka *and excluded from all worship. An assistant may be of another denomination, in case of necessity. The *yajamāna *("organizer, sponsor") must have undergone a *dikṣā *according to the Agamas. He should follow the *ācārya's *directions. He should support the temple worship and the maintenance of the temple building by destining the yield of certain plots of land to this end (*vrttikalpanam*).[^12]

[^12]:
     The Kāśyapa Jñānakāṇḍa treats this subject in ch. 21. See the translation, p. 80, n. 9. Information on the historical side may be found in: S. K. Aiyangar, A history of Tirupati, Vol. II (Madras, 1941), pp. 26f., 68, 148, 400f.; K. K. Pillay, The Sucindram temple (Madras, 1953), p. 275.

### 01 DAILY ACTIONS 

of the priest before going to the temple. Not in V, which only commences at 7. All other texts give some directions for certain regular actions to be performed before temple worship begins. These actions are indispensible for the *arcaka*.[^13]

[^13]:
     AN even devotes about twenty pages to the morning observances of a priest. These rules have very much in common with those of the Śrī Vaiṣṇava Brahmans reproduced by Rangachari, op. cit., pp. 48ff. There is in this aspect even only a small difference between Vaiṣṇava and Śaiva traditions (Diehl, op. cit., p. 86).

1.1 After rising at the hour of Brahma, the priest should meditate on the Lord *Nārāyaṇa *(BK, BP, BY). BK adds practically: he thinks of the kind of worship he is going to do and of the material he needs for it. AN, p. 6 says: he should praise the Lord of the world with songs (*samkirtayet*). This source cites a certain *Śaunaka*, who says that one should meditate on Hari while rising, on *Keśava *while walking and on *Govinda *while eating.[^14]

[^14]:
     The word samkirtayet points to the religious lyrical songs known all over India from the Middle Ages onwards (for the Vişnuites of South India especially those composed by the Ālvārs in the eighth or ninth century and collected by Nāthamuni in the Divyaprabandham).

1.2 He bathes (all main sources). BP adds: he puts on two clean garments, applies the *urdhvapundra*[^15](Vişnuite mark on the forehead), muttering the names *Keśava *etc. He should wear a garland, two strainers, a tulasi flower, and other ornaments (thus also KA).

[^15]:
     See APPENDIX-I , Urdhvapundra dharanam

    1.3 He sips water (K, M).[^16]

[^16]:
     SEE APPENDIX-II Achamanam

    1.4 He worships the fire (BKh, K).

    1.5 He regales gods, seers, and Fathers (tarpanam) (K, M).

    1.6 He performs *prāṇāyāma *(A, M).

    1.7 He mutters the *savitri *(A, BK, M).

    1.8 He performs the *sandhya *ceremony (A, one Ms.; BK, BP, BY, M).

1.9 He performs *brahmayajña *(muttering of hymns and formulas) (BK, BKh, K, M). BP specifies: he mutters the *mahāmantra*(?) and the *arunam*(?).

1.10 He studies sacred literature (A, BKh, K). BKh: he recites from the Vedas and the (Vaikhanasa) *atmasūkta *(see Appendix-III).

1.11 Of course, the utensils for worship should also be collected (A).

1.12 Now the daily routine in the temple can begin. The following description applies to morning worship after daybreak (prātar). At noon and in the evening (and sometimes at minor times of the day) worship takes place in the same manner, unless other directions are given.

हरिः ॐ! अथ विष्णोर्नित्यार्चनाविधिं व्याख्यास्यामः । 

अर्चको नित्यकर्माणि च कृत्वा षडक्षरेण पद्माक्षतुळसीदामानिधारयन् 'ॐ विष्णवे नमः*’ केशवादिद्वादश नामभिरूर्ध्वपुड्डाणि द्वादशकुर्यातोत्तरीयोष्ठीषाङ्गुळीयक उभयपवित्रं धारयन् 'प्रतद्विष्णु' रिति देवालयं द्विः प्रदक्षिणीकृत्य ॥

## Entering the temple

### 2 CIRCUMAMBULATION (pradakşiṇa). 

A circumambulation of the temple is to be made by the priest before he enters. While doing thus, he should say the mantra *pra tad viṣṇuḥ॑ stavate*.[^17]All authorities agree about this mantra, but while A, BK and K say that it should accompany the circumambulation proper, BKh, BY and M ordain that it should be uttered while the priest goes towards the temple or enters the temple precincts (the last in BKh); after that, he should perform the circumambulation (according to BKh with* ato devā)*.

[^17]:
      RV. 1,154,2; TBr. 2,4,3,4 etc.; VMP 8.1.12.6 (pratikena).

    ॐ प्रतद्विष्णुः॑ स्तव ते वी॒र्याय मृ॒गो न भी॒मः कु॑च॒रो गि॑रि॒ष्ठाः ।

    यस्यो॒रुषु॑ त्रि॒षु वि॒क्रम॑णे ष्वधि॑क्षि॒यंति॒ भुव॑नानि॒विश्वा᳚ ॥

2.1 BP: the priest should perform *nyāsa *on his arms and hands.

2.2 An interesting remark is made by BY: one should not enter the area of the temple's shadow without a special commission. Thus, this prohibition is not valid on the occasion of the pradakṣiņa (BP). AN, p. 29, says the same, and also that Vişņu dwells in the shadow of his image and his temple: *sadā sannihito viṣṇuḥ chāyāyor dhāmaberayoḥ / chāyātillanghanam naiva kuryād ālayaberayoḥ / pradakṣiņavidhāv etal langhanam tu na doṣakṛt.*

2.3 BP: an even number of circumambulations should be made, otherwise the ceremony will be subject to evil influences (*ābhicārika*). After an odd number of circumambulations, one should look towards the rising sun and mutter twelve sūktas.

2.4 BKh: make a bow to the temple and say:* vimānam prapadye *"I revere the temple". BY mentions the bow, without the words.

विमानं॒ प्रप॑द्ये । देवा॑वासं॒ प्रप॑द्ये । विष्णु॑मयं॒  प्रप॑द्ये  । वैकु॑ण्ठोद्भवं॒ प्रप॑द्ये ॥

2.5 BY: the result of the pradakṣina is indescribable even by Brahmā.                   AN: the sins committed in this life and in former lives are destroyed with every step of the circumambulation.

### 3 A BOW TO THE DOORKEEPER. 

The images of the lesser deities which serve as doorkeepers are standing beside the temple doors. The bow is only for their leader.       A, BKh, K mention his name as Maṇika. AN, p. 29: although there are more doorkeepers, Maṇika only is saluted, because he is the most important of them and holds the keys. The formula said is *maṇikam prapadye*, read in full by VMP: *maṇikam prapadye mahābalam prapadye vimalam prapadye dvārapālakam prapadye	 *"I revere Maṇika, I revere him who has great strength, I revere the spotless one, I revere the door-keeper."[^18]

[^18]:
     VMP 8,12.

मणिकं॒ प्रप॑द्ये । महाबलं॒ प्रप॑द्ये । विमलं॒ प्रप॑द्ये । द्वार॑पालकं॒ प्रप॑द्ये ॥

### 4 THE PRIEST TAKES UP THE KEY 

of the door of the temple (not in M). The formula is* nirastam rakṣaḥ.* VMP 8,12 *nirastam rakṣo nirasto ghaśamśo nirastā aratayah sasomā devā rakṣadhvam *"Thrown down is the demon, thrown down is the wicked element, thrown down are the greedy powers; oh gods, together with Soma, be protective."[^19]

[^19]:
     Cf. i.a. PS. 6,16. Of the last words (sasomā etc.), no trace is found in the Vedic examples of the formula.

    निरस्त॒ꣳ रक्षो॒ निर॑स्तो॒घश॑ꣳसो निर॑स्ता॒ अरा॑तय: । ससोमा॑ देवा॑ र॑क्षध्वम् ॥

### 5 HE APPLIES THE KEY TO THE DOOR-PANEL 

(M: he touches the door- panel with the key, saying nirastam). The formula generally given is: *hiranyapāṇim*. VMP 8,13 (p. 81) *hiranyapāṇim ūtaye savitaram upahvaye | sa cettā devatā padam* "I invoke hither the golden-handed Savitar for help; that deity is the knower of the place."[^20]

[^20]:
     18 RV. 1,22,5; TS. 1,4,25,1 etc. The formula may be applied here because Savitar's presence is needed to set working the cosmic scene represented by the ritual. Savitar knows the padam. This word probably has been interpreted as Vişnu's third step or "highest abode", paramam padam, which is represented by the temple.

    हिर॑ण्यपाणिमू॒तये॑ सवि॒तार॒मुप॑ ह्वये । स चेत्ता॑ दे॒वता॑ प॒दम् ॥

### 6 HE OPENS THE DOOR. 

The formula accompanying this action is: divam vivrņotu (only M prescribes hiranyapāṇim, see 5). VMP 8,13: *divam vivṛṇotu divi svargam pihitadvāram vivṛṇotu | divy antarikṣe devat- anām sapsarogam abhidarśayatam *"he must open the sky, the heaven in the sky, the door of which is closed, he must open; in the sky he must show the atmosphere of the gods, together with the throng of heavenly nymphs".[^21]

[^21]:
     As was already seen in n. 11, the temple is considered as God's abode in heaven. It is the *axis mundi *by which contact with the celestial regions is possible. It is not clear what idea must be connected with the word *antarikṣe *"in the intermediate space between earth and heaven, atmosphere" and why it should come in just here, after heaven has already been mentioned. The meaning may be some such thing as "heavenly dwelling".

    दि॒वं विवृ॑णोतु दि॒विस्व॒र्गं पि॑हितद्वा॒रं विवृ॑णोतु । 

    दिव्य॒न्त॒रि॑क्षे देवतानाꣳ साप्सरोगणमभि दर्शयताम् ॥

6.1 After the door has been opened, the priest enters. BY and M prescribe here the formula* divam vivrnotu* (which thus occurs twice in succession in BY). The formula is more in its place with the preceding situation.

### 7 HE LOOKS TO GOD'S FACE[^22] 

[^22]:
      Beside the better known belief in the "evil eye", there is also the "auspicious eye" of the deity, which is able to bestow good things. In *Saundaryalahari*, vs. 56 (ed. W. N. Brown), the poet asks the Great Goddess to bathe him in the glance of Her eye, by which he becomes rich and which causes no loss to the Goddess Herself.

(A, BK, BKh, K) AND MAKES A BOW (V+ all main sources, except K). Most authorities, including V, give the mantra *ato deva* etc.[^23] BK and M say: "with the formula belonging to Visņu", probably having the same litany in mind.

[^23]:
     A frequent litany in praise of Vişnu. It consists of the six verses RV. 1,22,16-21; VMP 6,1,1-6.

    ॐ अतो᳚दे॒वा अ॑वंतुनो॒ यतो॒ विष्णु᳚र्विचक्र॒मे । पृ॒थि॒व्यास्स॒प्त धाम॑भि: ॥

    इ॒दं विष्णु॒ र्विच॑क्रमे । त्रे॒धा निद॑धे प॒दं । स मू॑ढमस्यपा॒ग्ꣳ सु॒रे ॥

    त्रीणि॑ प॒दा वि च॑क्रमे॒ विष्णु॑र्गो॒पा अदा᳚भ्यः । ततो॒ धर्मा॑णि धा॒रय॒न् ॥

    विष्णोः॒ कर्मा॑णि पश्यत॒ यतो᳚ व्र॒तानि॑ पस्प॒शे । इंद्र॑स्य॒ युज्यः॒ सखा॒ ॥

    तद्विष्णोः᳚ पर॒मं प॒दग्ꣳ सदा॑ पश्यंति सू॒रयः॑ । दि॒वी॑व॒ चक्षु॒ रात॑त॒ग॒ꣳ ॥

    तद्विप्रा᳚सो विप॒न्यवो᳚जा गृ॒वां सस्समिं᳚धते । विष्णो॒र्य त्प॑र॒मं प॒दग्ꣳ ॥

*oṃ atodevā avantuno yato viṣṇurvicakrame | pṛthivyāssapta dhāmabhiḥ ||*

*idaṃ viṣṇurvicakrame | tredhā nidadhe padaṃ | sa mūḍhamasyapāgṃ sure ||*

*trīṇi padā vi cakrame viṣṇurgopā adābhyaḥ | tato dharmāṇi dhārayan ||*

*viṣṇoḥ karmāṇi paśyata yato vratāni paspaśe | indrasya yujyaḥ sakhā ||*

*tadviṣṇoḥ paramaṃ padagṃ sadā paśyaṃti sūrayaḥ | divīva cakṣurātatagṃ ||*

*tadviprāso vipanyavo jā gṛvāṃ sassamindhate | viṣṇoryat paramaṃ padagṃ ||*

### 8 HE CLASPS HIS HANDS THRICE. 

All sources agree on this point. The purpose of the ceremony must be that evil powers and influences should flee. This is also clear from the formula pronounced: samyantu ghorāņi. VMP: *samyantu ghorani śamyantu pāpâni śamyantu itayaḥ śubhāni vardhantam vardhantam subhani* "frightening elements must be pacified, evil elements must be pacified, diseases must be pacified, auspicious elements must increase, increase must the auspicious elements".[^24] — M and BP give this element after 10.

[^24]:
      In the Gṛhyasūtra, the formula is said while water is poured thrice; it may be as sumed that the three successive actions are done while the three parts of the formula beginning with samyantu are said. After the evils have been repelled thrice, the good powers must be set in motion with the last words, which are repeated by means of a chiasm.

    शाम्य॒न्तु घो॑राणि शाम्य॒न्तु पा॑पानि शाम्य॒न्तु ई॑तय: । 

    शुभानि वर्धन्ताम् वर्धताम् शुभानि ॥

*śubhāni vardhantām vardhatām śubhāni ॥*

### 9 GOD IS AWOKEN WITH A BOW. 

The fact that Vişnu is awake is mentioned by BK only. All the other sources say only that the priest should perform a bow to God. BY and M use the verb *prārthayate* "to ask for permission". This is more in consonance with the mantra given by all:* bhagavato balena* (BK *balamantra*). VMP 8,13 *bhagavato balena bhagavato viryena bhagavatas tejasā bhagavatah karmanā bhagavatánugrhito bhagavatanu dkyato bhagavantam dhyårvä bhagavatkarma karişyāmi | tad bhagavân anumanyatam *"By the strength of the Lord, by His heroism, by His energy, by His activity, blessed by Him, meditated upon by Him, meditating upon Him, I will perform His work. The Lord must consent with this intention.”[^25]

[^25]:
      The same formula is used by the Srivaisnavas: Rangachari, op. cit. (see n. 2), p. 135.

    ॐ ॐ ॐ भगव॒तो बले॑न भगव॒तो वी॒र्ये॑ण भगव॒तस् तेज॑सा भगव॒त: कर्म॑णा 

    भगव॒तानुगृहीतो भगवतानुध्यातो भगवन्तं ध्यात्वा भगवत् कर्म करिष्यामि । 

    तद् भगवान् अनुमन्यताम् ॥

### 10 THE LAMPS ARE KINDLED 

(Only in K, M, BP). M and BP have this element before 8. BP is most clear because it lays down that the priest should call an assistant and tell him to light the lamps. M and KA mention as the mantra to be said at this stage: *uddipyasva*. VMP 8,13* uddipyasva jätavedo (a)paghnan nirytim mama pašamś ca mahyam dvaha jivanam ca diso daśa*[^26]* *"flame up, Oh Jätavedas, striking away my destruction; and call flocks of cattle hither to me, and life all over the ten directions of the sky". - MD gives another mantra: *śubhra jyotih*. This is taken from a further stage in the ritual, cf. 65. 

[^26]:
      TAr. 10,1,4, etc. 

    ॐ उद्दी᳚प्यस्व जातवेदोप॒ग्नन्निऋ॑तिं॒ मम॑ । 

    प॒शूग्ꣳ श्च॒मह्य॒माव॑ह॒ जीव॑नञ्च॒ दिशो॑ दिश ॥

10.1 At this point, BP gives further rules about the preparation of the materials needed. Then a number of ceremonies are prescribed which occur later according to the main *samhitás *(thus e.g., wiping, smearing with cowdung, cleaning the vessels). KA in the same way has brought a change in the sequence in the following elements, and introduced some new features. For the sake of brevity and clarity they are not enlarged upon here.

## Assistants' duties (fetching water etc.) 

### 11 AN ASSISTANT (OR DISCIPLE) TAKES A POT. 

The assistant (*paricaraka*) is called *śişya *(disciple) by BY and K. He should have bathed himself (A, BY) and bowed to the Lord (BY). The mantra which he says while taking the pot is* duhatam divam*. VMP 8,13 *duhatam divam indras savitemam duhatám medinim / tad ubhayam prajānam niritaye nirudvegaya* "Indra must milk heaven, Savitar must milk this earth; both these acts are for freedom from calamities and freedom from disturbance for the creatures."[^27]

[^27]:
     Usually, the word *nirudvega* is a *bahuvrihi * compound and means: "free of disturbances". 

दु॒ह॒तान्दिवं॒ इन्द्र॑स्सविते॒माम् दु॑ह॒तां मे॒दिनी᳚म् । 

तद्॒ उभयं॑ प्रजा॒नां निरी॑तये॒ निरु॑द्वेगाय ॥

###  12 HE FILLS THE POT WITH WATER. 

A river, a pond or a pure well are unanimously allowed in this sequence as sources for the water. The mantra, also given unanimously, is *adyam abhighṇāmi.* VMP:* adyam abhigrhnami naram abhigrimami amptam abhigrhnami toyam abhigylmämi | satridivam yo 'bhūt sa brahmamio yam abhigphṇāmi *"I take the primeval One, I take the primeval Water, I take the water of life, I take the water; he who enclosed in his origin the three parts of the universe, he whom I take is an inherent part of Brahman." - The mantra is not completely clear, but as the main point it appears that the water is addressed here in the male singular as a power which is the origin of creation and which possesses eternal life. Instead of this mantra, according to BP, also the *gayatri *is permissible. 

आद्य्म् अभिगृह्णामि । नारं अभिगृह्णामि । तोयं अभिगृह्णामि । अमृतं अभिगृह्णामि । 

सत्रिदिवम् याऽभूत्सा ब्राह्यम्यं तोयं अभिगृह्णामि ॥

*ādym abhigṛhṇāmi । nāraṃ abhigṛhṇāmi । toyaṃ abhigṛhṇāmi । amṛtaṃ abhigṛhṇāmi । *

*satridivam yā'bhūtsā brāhyamyaṃ toyaṃ abhigṛhṇāmi ॥*

    ॐ भूर्भुव॒: सुव॑: । तथ्स॑वि॒तुर्वरे᳚ण्यं॒ भर्गो॑ दे॒वस्य॑ धीमहि । धियो॒ यो न॑: प्रचो॒दया᳚त् ॥ 

    12.1 BP: meditate on the water as being the Ganges. 

    इ॒मं मे॑ गंगे यमुने सरस्वति॒ शुतु॑द्रि॒ स्तोमं॑ सचता॒ परु॒ष्ण्या ।

    अ॒सि॒क्न्या म॑रुद्वृधे वि॒तस्त॒यार्जी॑कीये शृणु॒ह्या सु॒षोम॑या ॥

    12.2 BK: the water should not be taken in the neighbourhood of an outcast's dwelling. 

12.3 K and KA have a peculiar prescription: if no river, pond or well is available, he should stand worshipping to the northeast:* naditatäkakü pánám alabhe purvasyottaram upatistheta*. We expect: if no river is available (in the vicinity), he should take water from a pond or well (standing facing the northeast). This is actually said by M. The other texts lack the prescription about the direction in which the assistant should stand while filling the pot with water. 

नदीतटाककूपानाम् अलाभे पूर्वस्योत्तरं उत्तिष्ठेता ॥

*nadītaṭākakūpānām alābhe pūrvasyottaraṃ uttiṣṭhetā ॥*

### 13 HE BRINGS THE POT TO THE TEMPLE. 

The pot is covered with a cloth (BK, KA) or linen (BP), and the assistant puts it on his head (BKh, K) or takes it in his arms (BKh). BP and KA give the alternative of putting it on an elephant's back. This elephant is thought to represent or to carry Indra, as appears from the mantra chosen (prescribed only by VMP and KA): *arvañcam indram (amuto havamahe yo gojid dhanajid aśvajid yab imam me yafham vihave juşasva asya kurmo harivo medinim tva.)*[^28]* *" We call Indra hither from beyond; he is the winner of cows, money and horses; enjoy this sacrifice of mine notwithstanding the various invocations of others; we make for you, Oh Possessor of bay horses, its earth (ready." 

[^28]:
     R.V. 10,128,1; 7B. 2,4,3,2, etc.

    अ॒र्वाञ्च॒मिन्द्र॑म॒मुतो॑ हवामहे । यो गो॒जिद्॑ ध॒नजिद्॑ अश्व॒जिद्य: । 

     इ॒मं नो॑ य॒ज्ञं वि॑ह॒वे जु॑षस्व । अ॒स्य कु॑र्मो हरिवो मे॒दिनं॑ त्वा ॥

    13.1 Then a circumambulation is made around the temple, accompanied by all kinds of music. 

### 14 HE PUTS DOWN THE POT IN THE TEMPLE. 

This is done with the formula* somam rájánam varuņam agnim anvárabhamahe adityân vişnun süryam* *brahmaņam ca bṛhaspatim* "[^29]  We hold fast from behind king Soma, Varuņa, Agni, the Adityas, Visņu, Sürya, Brahma and Bṛhaspati." According to BY and M, the mantra is already said while the assistant enters the temple. 

[^29]:
     T.S.. I,7,10,3 etc. Although this formula was originally directed to a great number of gods, it is here especially devoted to Soma. In K, chs. 45 and 67, it accompanies the deposit of objects in the north, Soma's region. Thus the mantra can be applied to holy water. In K, ch. 40, it is said while the roots of a tree are sprinkled. 

सोम॒ꣳ॒ राजा॑नं॒ वरु॑णम॒ग्निम॒न्वार॑भामहे । 

आ॒दि॒त्यान् वि॑ष्णु॒ꣳ॒ सूर्यं॑ ब्र॒ह्माणं॑ च॒ बृह॒स्पति᳚म् ॥

*ā॒di॒tyān viṣṇu॒ꣳ॒ sūryaṃ॑ brahmāṇaṃ॑ ca॒ bṛhaspati᳚m ॥*

14.1 The pot is put down on an adorned tripod (BP), in the bathing hall (BK) or inner hall (BP), to the north or somewhat to the northeast (of the main image) (BKh). 

14.2 A difference now occurs in the sequence of elements described hereafter. A and K here interrupt the discussion of the assistants' duties for the description of the meditation of the main priest himself, which he probably performs while the assistants are away fetching water. In K, meditation is described even before 14. VMP, M, BY and BK insert the meditation after 19, at a point when only a few assistants' duties are left. BKh, in its description, takes the meditation for granted; only BP first gives all the assistants' duties, and only then records the activities of the ācārya. For practical reasons, this order is followed here. 

### 15 HE (the assistant) STRAINS THE WATER. 

Mantra: *dharāsu saptasu ca manasesu sarassaritsu paripūritsu / apo 'bhigrhṇan pratipadayisye grhṇamis*[^30]* dhattam suciram susarma* “Taking water from the seven streams and the Manasa waters, from ponds and rivers well filled, I shall procure them; I take (them), and He must give due protection for a good long time.” [^31]The straining is done with a bundle of kuśa grass or a garment. 

[^30]:
     VMP reads grnomi ( = grnämi "I praise"); Mysore MS,* ranobhi*.

[^31]:
     VMP on Gṛhyasūtra 1,6 (translation by Caland, p. 13).

ॐ धा॒रा॒सु॒ स॒प्त॒सु च मा॑नसे॒षु सरस्सरित्सु परिपू॑रिते॒षु । 

अपोऽभिगृह्णान् प्रतिपा॑दयि॒ष्ये गृणोमि धत्ताꣳ सुचिर॑ꣳ सुश॒र्मा ॥

*oṃ dhārāsu saptasu ca mānaseṣu sarassaritsu paripūriteṣu । *

*apo'bhigṛhṇān pratipādayiṣye gṛṇomi dhattāꣳ suciraꣳ suśarmā ॥*

### 16 HE CENSES WITH PERFUMES 

….AND SPEAKS A FORMULA OVER THE WATER. The perfumes are not mentioned in A, K and BKh. The perfumes mentioned are *elā *(cardamom), *usīra *and other substances. According to BP, the assistant gives the perfumes to the priest, who then throws them into the water. The formula uttered now is:* “idam apaś śivās śivatamāś śāntāś śāntatamāś śubhāś śubhatamāś pūtāh pūtatamāh / puṇyāh punyatamā medhyā medhyatamā amṛtā amṛtarasāh / pūtā brahmapavitreņa pūtāś sāryasya raśmibhih” “* Here are waters which are auspicious, very auspicious, safe, very safe, agreeable, very agreeable, pure, very pure, blessing, very blessing, clean, very clean; the waters of life, which posses the vigour of  the waters of life; purified by the purifier which is Brahman, purified by the sun's rays.”[^32]

[^32]:
      VMP on *Grhyasutra *1,3 (translation by Caland, p. 6, n. 7). Cf. Baudhayana Grhya parisistasutra 2,13 (ed. Harting, see Introduction, n. 4): imã apah (säntah, MS. D) siváh sivatamah pütüb patatama medkyä mediyatama argeyäs tä jurantäre prati grhyanları prutigphpätu bhagaván mahāvisyur visyave namah and Vimarsini, commen tary on Narayana's *Tantrosamuccaya*, 7, 27ff. (a work on temple worship hailing from Kerala): ima apah sind zanta jabhay Judáší ca nirmalah parantė ištakiś caiva pet zaryaiya raśmibhi 

    इ॒दं आप॑श्शि॒वा: शि॒वत॑मा, शा॒न्ता: शा॒न्तत॑मा॒ शुभा॒: शुभ॑तमा: ।

     पू॒ता ब्र॑ह्म प॒वित्रे॑ण पू॒ता सूर्य॑स्य र॒श्मिभि॑: ॥

16.1 BP here suggests holding a *punyaha *ceremony according to the (*Vaikhanasa) Sutra. *[^33]

[^33]:
     SEE APPENDIX-VI

### 17 HE WIPES THE INTERIOR OF THE TEMPLE. 

He does so with a "wiper" (marjani). The wiper has Jyestha as its presiding deity (AN, p. 30). All agree about the formula:* avadhutam rakso 'vadhuta ardtayah /  ava- dhutas so 'sti yo 'sman dresti yam ca vayam dvisma* "[^34]  Wiped away is the demon, wiped away are the greedy ones, wiped away is he who hates us, and whom we hate." During wiping, dust-clouds should be avoided. 

[^34]:
     VMP 8,14; TS. 1,1,5,1 etc.

    अव॑धूत॒ꣳ॒ रक्षो अव॑धूता॒ अरा॑तय: । अव॑धूत॒ꣳसो᳚स्तु॒यो᳚ स्मान् द्वेष्टि॒ यं च॑ व॒यं द्वि॒ष्म: ॥

### 18 HE SMEARS WITH COWDUNG 

AND SPRINKLES WITH COWS' URINE.K, BK: he smears, then sprinkles. A, BY: he sprinkles, then smears. M combines both actions by way of a chiasmus. BY: he should smear cow dung over a piece of the floor in the shape of a half moon and around the pedestal for the *bhutas *(demons) for the distance of an oxhide. BKh: sprinkle all utensils, inside and outside. The mantra used is* asasu saptasu*. VMP 8,14* ásásu saptasv api kamjare kha*[^35] *apas*[^36]* samagras samudavahami somagnisuryamrtapuskarinam apas samavahya puras karisye *" “In the seven directions, also..., I invoke all waters hither / having invoked the waters from the lotus ponds filled with the waters of life, I shall put before me (for protection) Soma, Agni, and Surya.” Or: "... having invoked Soma, Agni, Surya and the waters from the lotus ponds filled with the waters of life, I shall place them in front of me (for protection)." 

[^35]:
      KAV (which also records these formulas in full): kham, 

[^36]:
     A nominative plural instead of the accusative plural apas. 

    आशासु सप्तस्वपि क॑म्जरे॒ खा॒ आप॑स् सम॒ग्रा स्स॑मु॒दाव॑हामी ॥

    सोमाग्नि सूर्यामृतपु॑ष्करी॒णा॒ माप॑स्समा॒वाह्य॒पुर॑स्करिष्ये  । 

### 19 HE CLEANS THE VESSELS 

with the formula *a må vajasya*. This is not found in A and K. The formula is as follows: *à ma vėjasya prasavo Jagamyad à dyäväppthivi viśvasambhú | à mà gantam pitară matură ca maso mo amrtaya gamyat*[^37] "May the instigation of generative power come to me, to me heaven and earth beneficent to all; to me should come my father and my mother; the moon must come to me for freedom from death." KA mentions for this element the mantra* śuci vo havya *(BP also mentions it, during a sprinkling of the materials):* śuci vo havya marutas śucīnām śucim hinomy adhvaram śucibhyaḥ | stena satyam ṛtasapa dyăn śucijanmānaś śucayaḥ pāvakāḥ .*[^38]* *"I send pure offerings to you, Oh Maruts, because you are pure; I set a pure sacrificial ceremony in motion for you who are pure; by means of *rta*, may truly those come who respect *rta*, those who are pure by birth, who are pure and purifying." 

[^37]:
     TS. 1,7,8; VMP on Grhyasatra 4,4; etc.

19.1 The offerings are ordered to be cooked (A, M, BY). One of the assistants specializes in cooking (cf. 0.4). 

19.2 M, BK, BY, BMP now proceed to discuss the meditation of the priest described in group C (see also 14.2). 

### 20 HE REMOVES *nirmalya*. 

*Nirmalya *are the flowers left over on the pedestal from the worship of the preceding day. This element is mentioned unanimously, even by V (in V it is the first thing to be done after 7). Before removal, the flowers are cleaned (K) with the formula *naśyanti jagatam*, mentioned by K, BK, BP; VMP 8, 16* naśyanti jagatam Itayo nirastah paravasus saha papmana *"the diseases of the world are destroyed, thrown away is the force which keeps off wealth, together with the evil". 

    नश्यन्ति जगतं इति देवस्य निर्माल्यं संशोध्य ॥ 

नश्य॑न्ति जग॑ता मी॒तयो॒ निर॑स्त: परा॒वसु॑ स: पा॒प्मना॑᳚ ॥

*naśyanti jagataṃ iti devasya nirmālyaṃ saṃśodhya ॥  *

20.1 The removal is done from the east, clockwise, to the northeast. It is accompanied by the mantra *aham evedam* (A, K, BKh, BP). VMP 8, 16 *aham evedam kariṣyāmi vibhoh kartum nidhāsyati | kariṣyāmy atra yat kañcit tan me devo 'numanyatām* "I will do this for the Lord; [He] will appoint me to do it; everything which I shall do here, that the God must concede me." M, BY prescribe* pūtas tasya*, which however belongs to 21. 

    अ॒हंमे॒वेदनं क॑रिश्यामि वि॒भो: क॒र्तुं नि॑धास्यति ।

    क॑रिष्या॒ म्यत्र॒ यत्कञ्चि॒त् तन्मे॑ दे॒वोऽनु॑मन्यताम् ॥

### 21 HE CLEANS THE PLACES OF WORSHIP 

(*vedi*) WITH WATER. Mentioned by all, including V. The mantra is* pūtas tasya* (A, K, BK, BKh): *pūtas tasya pare bhuvanasya madhye | nakasya prsthe mahato mahīyān*[^39]" "the pure one, out of the reach of this world and yet inside it; at the back of the firmament, greater than the great". In addition to this mantra, V and M prescribe the *vyahṛti*. VMP mentions here the *viṣṇugāyatri: tatpuruṣāya vidmahe mahādevāya dhimahi | tan no vişnuḥ pracodayāt*[^40]" "we strive for Tatpurușa, we meditate for Mahadeva, thus Viṣņu may impel us." BP clarifies the use of this mantra: it should be said while the pedestal of the immovable image is cleaned, while the mantra *pütas tasya* is destined for the movable image. 

[^39]:
     According to the reading of KAV on KA 4. I could not find the mantra in VMP. 

[^40]:
     TĀR. 10,1,5 etc.goudriaan wrote the wrong gayatri

*oṃ bhū: । oṃ bhuva: । oṃꣳ suva: ॥*

### 22 HE LAYS FLOWERS AT VISŅU'S FEET, 

uttering the names of the Pañca- mürti or Five Manifestations: Visnu, Puruşa, Satya, Acyuta, and Aniruddha, all in the dative and ending with *namah*. The authorities also prescribe the *visnugayatri .*

    ॐ ना॒रा॒य॒णाय॑ वि॒द्महे॑ वासुदे॒वाय॑ धीमहि । तन्नो॑ विष्णु: प्रचो॒दया॑᳚त् ॥ 

    विष्ण॑वे॒ नम॑: । पुरु॑षाय॒ नम॑: । स॒त्याय॒ नम॑: । अच्यु॑ताय॒ नम॑: । अनिरु॑द्धाय॒ नम॑:॥

### 23 HE WORSHIPS VISVAKSENA WITH THE REMNANTS (*nirmalya*). 

During this, Vişvaksena is to be addressed with his *mürtimantras* or manifestation names: Visvaksena, Sänta, Hara and Amita. This element is prescribed by all authorities except V, although K remarks that the tradition is due to Bhrgu.

    विष्व॑क्सेनं॒ प्रप॑द्ये । शान्तं॒ प्रप॑द्ये । हरं॒ प्रप॑द्ये । अमितं॒ प्रप॑द्ये ॥

 23.1 According to M and BY, he should also worship other attendant deities with the remnants. According to BKh, the *nirmalyas* of the other images are laid in the first courtyard with the words: * bhaktānām pāpanāśarthaṃ dadāmi *"I give them for destruction of the devotees' evil." BP: other remains may be thrown into the water at a pure spot. 

 भक्तानाम् पापनाशर्थं ददामि ॥

* bhaktānām pāpanāśarthaṃ dadāmi ॥*

23.2 BP and KA now discuss the preparation of the vessels and the invocation of the presiding deities. Cf. below, 48. These texts, and also AN, p. 40, lay stress on the fact that a bell should be rung during worship and that musical instruments should be played: this causes the gods to appear and the demons to go away; and Hari is a lover of sweet music (AN). 

    आगमार्धन्तु देवानाम् गमनार्धन्तु रक्षसाम् । 

    घन्टा नादम् करोमद्य देवाराधन कर्मणि ॥

## Meditation (Brahmanyäsa)

 Before worship of the Universal Lord is possible, it is necessary that the human and the divine should be brought into contact with each other. To this end, the worshipper should leave the ordinary, human level of consciousness and enlarge it into cosmic size. He should become Visnu Himself (BY 20 *atmânam bhavayed dharim*). Besides, the utensils are to be hallowed with divine names (see 48), so that the whole ritual will become a cosmic process, in which Vişnu Näräyaņa by His divine will power sets all other powers in motion. The other deities are His attendants, all fit to do their own duty. The worshipper as the Divinity Itself, is purified in the highest degree by this process of identifying himself with God as Brahman (Brahman is a purifier and stabilizer) and collects an enormous amount of power into himself. By steady performance of this ritual, the life-process on earth will go on steadily (and an interruption would have bad results, as the texts regularly warn; see e.g. K, ch. 1). 

In the description of the meditation, an evolution is to be clearly observed in the Vaikhānasa texts. V has no place at all for it; A mentions only the elements 24, 30 and 33, and superficially at that; K gives a few more lines; M, BK and BY give about the same as K, but their order is more systematic (BKh leaves out the meditation altogether, silently referring to another source); the later monographs (KA, KAV, BP, AN) have added considerably to the prescriptions given by the handbooks. 

The method of enlargement of consciousness given by the handbooks focuses, as its name, *Brahmanyasa*, indicates, on the assignment of Brahman to the body by means of concentration of the mind, accompanied by formulas and gestures. The method as such seems to be unique.[^41] The mantras used are not found elsewhere (except the *viṣṇugayatri*). They emphasize identity, partly with Vișņu, partly with Brahman and the other gods. 

[^41]:
      Its elements recall the şaḍanganyasa as performed by the Srivaishnavas (Ranga- chari, op. cit., p. 134), but are not identical with it, because they use other mantras and contain other actions also. KA and KAV added a *şaḍanganyasa *immediately after the *Brahmanyasa*.

The later monographs preserved this meditation, but added a number of observances of "Tantric" character; observances which are found abundantly in Sivaite and Päñcarātra Agamas, and which seem to have been accepted only reluctantly within the temple ritual of the orthodox Vaikhānasa sect. The Vaikhānasas, in fact, always exerted themselves to maintain Vedic ways of worship, and remained doing so even after the exigencies of time were obeyed by incorporation of the new viewpoints about identification with the Supreme. The handbooks with their *Brahmanyasa *already show a modest preamble to these new cult methods; their way of presentation must be seen as important for the history of Hindu liturgy. 

The new elements described by the monographs are i.a. *pīṭharcanā*, *prāṇāyāma, bhūtaśuddhi *(purification of the elements, in combination with burning the evil in the body), *prāṇapratiṣṭhā *(establishment of life- breath, i.e. of the divine body), *mātṛkānyāsa *(assignment of the mystical alphabet). All these elements are paralleled in Päñcarātra, Sivaite and Tantric sources and are performed up till now. The present description restricts itself to the *Brahmanyasa *of the handbooks.

### 24 THE PRIEST TOUCHES HIS HEART. 

The Brahman or suprapersonal unity of the cosmos is fixed in the heart, whence it protects the performer. The accompanying formula, according to VMP 8,14 *brahma brahmântardimā brahma pūtântarātmā brahmani brahmaniştho brahmagupto gupto 'ham asmi *"[I am] the Brahman, my inner Self is Brahman, the Brahman, my inner Self is pure; I exist in Brahman, abiding in Brahman, protected by Brahman, protected." To this, KAV adds the words: hṛdayāya namaḥ "honour, to the heart".

    ॐ ब्रह्म ब्रह्मा᳚न्तरा॒त्मा ब्रह्मपूता᳚न्तरा॒त्मा ब्रह्म॑णि॒ ब्रह्म॑नि॒ष्ठो ब्रह्म॑गु॒प्तो॑ गु॒प्तो॑ऽहम॑स्मि ॥ हृदयाय नम: ॥

24.1 BK: during *Brahmaṇyāsa *the priest sits in the lotus or brahman posture, with folded hands, bearing the *ūrdhvapundra *(Vișnuite mark on the forehead), upper garment, headdress, and ornaments. He should also bear a strainer (*pavitram*). BY: he should bow for the presiding deities of the Vişnuite marks (Keśava etc.) and assign the alphabet "as before" (no hint which place is referred to). This is a reference to the *matṛkānyāsa*, cf. the remarks above. 

### 25 HE TOUCHES HIS HEAD. 

The head is identified with heaven: *dyaur dyaur asi sarva ime prāṇās sthānava asan* (VMP 8,15) "you are the heaven, the heaven; all my life-breaths may be firm". KAV adds* sirase svāhā *"to the head, svāhā". The function of the *prāṇas *is probably that they have to stabilize the priest in his role as the *axis mundi*. 

    द्यौर्द्यौर॑सि॒ सर्व॑ इ॒मे प्रा॒णास्था॒नव॑ आसन् ॥ शिरसे स्वाहा ॥ शिखे उद्वर्तयामि ।

### 26 HE TOUCHES HIS TUFT OF HAIR,

 and brings there the world of the gods with the following mantra (VMP 8,15): *śikhe udvartayāmi savedās samantrās sarpās sasomā devāḥ parivartayantam* "O hair-tuft, I cause to ascend; the gods, together with the Vedas, the mantras, the seers and Soma, should wind themselves around." KAV adds:* sikhāyai vauşat *"to the hair-tuft, *vauşat*". 

    स वेदा᳚ स्समन्त्रा॒ स्सार्षा॒ स्ससोमा॑ दे॒वा: प॑रिव॒र्तय॑न्ताम् । शिखायै वषट् ॥

### 27 HE MAKES ARMOUR (*kavacam*) AROUND HIMSELF.

 Instead of *kavacam*, K and BK use the word rakṣā, "protection". This protection may be seen as an early instance of the *digbandhas *"obstructions of the regions of the compass", which are so well-known in Hindu ritual. The protection is effected by means of the formula* devānām ayudhaiḥ paribādhayāmi brahmaņo mantrair īśasyojasā bhṛgūnām angirasam tapasā sarvum ātanomi *(VMP 8,15) "I ward off by means of the weapons of the gods; by the formulas of Brahman, the overpowering force of Iśa, the asceticism of the Bhṛgus and Angirases I penetrate everything." KAV adds the words: *kavacāya hum* "to the armour, *hum*". There is no information about the gesture accompanying the mantra. According to Rangachari, The *Śrī Vaisnava Brahmans* (Madras, 1931), p. 134, the priest touches his shoulders. 

    दे॒वाना॑म् आयु॒धै: परि॑बाधयामि ॥ ब्रह्म॑णो॒ मन्त्रै॒रीश॒स्तेज॑सा॒ ॥ कवचाय हुम् ॥

    भृगू॑णा॒म् अङ्गि॑रसां॒ तप॑सा॒ सर्व॒मात॑नोमि ॥ नेत्रत्रयाय वौषट् ॥

27.1 An addition made by KA and BP: the priest constitutes a weapon (*astram*, KA), armour (*kavacam*, KAV) or obstruction of the regions of the sky (*dasadigbandha*, BP) by means of the *viṣṇugāyatri*. This element is clearly of a secondary character, as is shown also by the unoriginality of the mantra concerned. It is brought in here very probably under the influence of Saiva ritual (cf. Fausta Nowotny, "Das Pūjāvidhinirūpaņa des Trimalla",* Indo-Iranian *Journal, I, 1957, p. 115). After the *viṣṇugayatri*, KAV adds:* astrāya phat* "to the weapon, phat". 

    ॐ ना॒रा॒य॒णाय॑ वि॒द्महे॑ वासु॒देवाय॑ धीमहि । तन्नो॑ विष्णु: प्रचो॒दया᳚त् ॥ अस्त्राय फट् ॥

27.2 KA and KAV add another digbandha (called thus by KAV), accompanied by the vyāhṛti: *om bhûr bhuvas suvar om*. 

    ॥ ॐ भू: भुव: सुव: ॐ॥ इति दिग्बन्ध: ॥ 

*॥ oṃ bhū: bhuva: suva: oṃ॥ iti digbandha: ॥ *

### 28 HE MEDITATES ON THE DISC AND CONCH OF VISŅU 

AS BEING BORNE BY HIM IN HIS RIGHT AND LEFT HANDS. He does so by making the mudras of the disc *Sudarsana *and the conch (*sankha*) (thus M; according to BY, he should meditate (*smaret*) on these attributes of Vişnu as being in his hands). This element is accompanied by the words* sudarśanam abhigṛhṇāmi* "I take [the disc] Sudarśana" and *ravipam abhigṛhṇāmi *"I take the protector of (?) the sun" respectively (VMP 8,15). [^42]

[^42]:
     The assignment of the attributes of Viṣṇu to the priest's hands also in Rangachari, op. cit., p. 140, but with other formulas.

    सु॒द॒र्श॒न म॒भिगृ॑ह्णामि ॥ रवि॑पा म॒भिगृ॑ह्णामि ॥

28.1 Only BY suggests also meditation on other weapons, in order to protect oneself, as follows: the bow in front, the lance to the right, the mace behind, the sword to the left, the disc(?) above, Vāsuki (the King of serpents) below, and other weapons (*astrani*) in the intermediate directions. With the right hand one should make a sign of preservation with the words* viṣṇus tvām rakṣatu *"Visnu should protect you". 

### 29 HE ASSIGNS SUN AND MOON TO HIS EYES.

 This is done, according to BP, by means of their diagrams (*mandala*). The sun is assigned to the right eye with the formula *sūryo 'si sūryāntarātmā cakṣur asi sarvam asi sarvam dhehi *"You are the sun, whose inner Self is the sun; you are the eye, you are everything, establish everything." The moon is assigned to the left eye with the words *candro 'si yajño 'si yajñāyādhānam asi yajñāsya ghosad asi *"You are the moon, you are the sacrifice, you are the kindling of the sacred fire done for the sacrifice, you are the cow-seat of the sacrifice" (VMP 8,16). 

    सूर्यो॑ऽसि॒ सूर्या᳚न्तरा॒त्मा चक्षु॑रसि॒ सर्व॑मसि॒ सर्वं॑ देहि ॥ Touch R eye

    चन्द्रो॑सि य॒ज्ञो॑सि य॒ज्ञाया॒धान॑मसि य॒ज्ञस्य॑ घो॒शद॑सि ॥ Touch L eye

### 30 HE FIXES THE PRIMEVAL SYLLABLE (*adibija*) ON HIS HEART. 

This is the syllable a according to A, M and BK. A, who gives only little details of the *Brahmanyása*, is on this point more instructive than the others: "the syllable *a *is the base of all the letters in the alphabet, just as Näräyaņa is the base of all the gods". This records an early stage of sound-symbolism. A and BK add that the syllable* a *should be surrounded by a number of *om*-syllables. 

30.1 A says: he should utter the formula* sam no vată* for appeasement, before starting worship. Two manuscripts of A, however, omit this remark. 

### 31 HE ASSIGNS A DIAGRAM (*mandala*) OF SUN AND MOON 

TO HIS RIGHT AND LEFT HAND-PALMS. This element is not in A, BK, BP. Its occurrence here is somewhat problematic with respect to 29, where sun and moon were assigned to the eyes. Is this due to a blend of two traditions? It might be significant that the element is mentioned in KA, but not in its commentary KAV. – BY again says that he should meditate (*smaret*) on the diagrams of sun and moon, while K and M, in practically identical words, speak about "assign" (*nyaset*). A formula is not given; again a token of the abnormal character of this element. 

### 32 HE WORSHIPS IN HIS FINGERS THEIR PRESIDENG DEITIES. 

This is called *karanyāsa *by BP.[^43] The five presiding deities of the fingers are: Abhuranya,[^44]Vidhi, Yajña, Brahmä, and Devendra. [^45]

[^43]:
     In AN, p. 50, the alphabet is assigned to the hands.

[^44]:
     BK: *adbhuranyam*; VMP, BP: *abhuranyam*. Apastamba Srautasutra 1,9,9: *abhuranya*. Cf. Caland, Altindischer Ahnencult (Leiden, 1893), p. 193. 

[^45]:
     BY: Indra, but variant reading: Devendra. In the *Grhyasutra *1,2, there are other names for the presiding deities of the fingers: Agni, Vayu, Prajapati, Sürya and Indra. Yajña is called Yajhanga by VMP. 

1. आभु॑रण्यं॒ अङ्गुष्टाभ्यां नम: ।		*ābhu̍raṇya̱ṃ aṅguṣṭābhyāṃ nama: .*
2. विधिं॑ तर्जनीभ्यां नम: ।			*vidhi̍ṃ tarjanībhyāṃ nama: .*
3. य॒ज्ञं मध्यमाभ्यां नम: ।			*ya̱jñaṃ madhyamābhyāṃ nama: .*
4. ब्र॒ह्माणं॑ अनामिकाभ्यां नम: ।		*bra̱hmāṇa̍ṃ anāmikābhyāṃ nama: .*
5. देवे॒न्द्रम्  कनिष्टिकाभ्यां नम: ॥		*deve̱ndram  kaniṣṭikābhyāṃ nama: ..*

### 33 HE MEDITATIS ON BRAHMA.

(Thus the texts, in the masculine.) This element is given by all authorities. BP says: *Brahmanyása *is done in the heart. The formula said now is:* antar asminn ime lokā antar viśvam idam jagat | brahmatva bhūtānām jyestham tena ko 'rhati spardhitum *"within Him are these worlds, within Him is this whole creation; for Brahmä is the most ancient Principle of living beings;  who is able to compete with Him?[^46] 

[^46]:
     VMP 8,16; TBr. 2,8,8,9. 

    अ॒न्तर॑स्मिन्नि॒मे लो॒का: अ॒न्तर्विश्व॑मि॒दं जग॑त् । 

    ब्रह्मै॒व भू॒तानां॒ ज्येष्ठ᳚म् । तेन॒ को॑ऽर्हति॒ स्पर्धि॑तुम् ॥

*a̱ntara̍sminni̱me lo̱kā: a̱ntarviśva̍mi̱daṃ jaga̍t .  \
brahmai̱va bhū̱tānā̱ṃ jyeṣṭha̎m . tena̱ ko̍'rhati̱ spardhi̍tum ..*

33.1 BY alone gives the following important remark: with the words *antar asminn* etc. (the first half of the sloka) he should touch his lower arms; with *brahmaiva *etc. (the second half) he creates that deity by meditation (*bhavayet*). 

## Bathing the image 

In the description given by the handbooks the movable image is bathed and cleaned now, before the Lord is invoked into it. This order is found also in the description of the Saiva ritual by Diehl. There *Lingaśuddhi *"cleaning the Linga" occurs as element 30 on p. 115, where it precedes the invocation of the God. K, ch. 73: this bathing (*abhiseka*) is done in the morning only. The bath of the image during the *püja *(68), is done also at other times. In the ritual of bathing of the Vaikhanasas two remarkable tendencies are to be observed: (1) The ritual, which is not found described in V, grows more intricate. This is already seen in the *Bhrgu Samhita*: both BK and BKh (remarkably enough, not BY) discuss the bathing ceremony more elaborately than the others. Yet these two do not agree at all with each other; the new elements they give tend to differ from each other and are found in different places. The elaboration is continued by VMP, BP and the monographs in a manner deviating from both BK and BKh. (2) In BP and the monographs the sequence of the ceremonies has been changed; the bathing there is done within the cadre of the *püja *only. Thus it comes after the invocation of Visņu and after the Lord has been worshipped already with some rites combined under the word *mantrasana*. The bathing is in these texts, called *snanāsana *"bathing-seat". This sequence is found also in Rangachari's descrip- tion (The *Sri Vaisnava Brahmans*, p. 148). In a sense this change is perfectly comprehensible. After the priest has made himself fit for worship by identifying himself with God, the thing to be expected now, in the first place, is that the worship will be inaugurated by His invocation. The question is if the modification in the order of the elements is due to a revision made by the Vaikhanasas of their own accord or under the influence of the Päñcarätrins or Śrī Vaisnavas. 

### 34 HOMAGE IS PAID TO THE LORD WITH A BOW. 

All authorities give on this point the formula* bhüh prapadye*. VMP 8,17 *bhûh prapadye bhuvah prapadye suvah prupudye bhür bhuvas suvaḥ prapadye *| *virajamanam tam ajam prapadye tejomayam tejasām apy agamyam / sarvätmanam tamasah parabhūtam bhūtyű viévam pati yas tum prapadye / visnum prapadye puruşam prapadye satyam prapadye acyutam prapadye aniruddham prapadye *"bhüh, I surrender myself; bhuvah I surrender myself; suvah, I surrender myself; bhur bhuvas suvar, I surrender myself; I surrender myself to that illustrious and unborn One, Who is lustre, but inaccessible to other lustres; the Self of all, existing beyond the reach of darkness; He Who protects everything through His expansive power, to Him I surrender myself. I surrender myself to Visnu, Purusa (the Primeval Person), Satya (the True One), Acyuta (the Steadfast One), and Aniruddha (the Unobstructed One). " [^47]

[^47]:
     The last five names are those of the Five Manifestations of Vişnu; a theological concept held by the Vaikhanasas. See *Kasyapa Jnänakända*, chs. 77 and 78. 

    भूः प्रप॑द्ये॒ भुव॒: प्रप॑द्ये॒ स्वः॑ प्रप॑द्ये॒ भूर्भूव॒स्स्वः॑ प्रप॑द्ये॒ ॥

    वि॒राज॑मान॒म् तं॑ अजं॒ प्रप॑द्ये । तेजो॑मयं॒ तेज॑सा॒ मप्य॒गम्य॒ꣳ॒ ।

    सर्वा॒त्मानम्॒ तम॑स॒: पार॑भूतं भू॒त्या वि॒श्वं पा॑ति॒ यस्तं प्रप॑द्ये ॥

    विष्णुं॒ प्रप॑द्ये । पुरुषं॒ प्रप॑द्ये । सत्यं॒ प्रप॑द्ये । अच्युतं॒ प्रप॑द्ये । अनिरुद्धं॒ प्रप॑द्ये ॥

### 35 THE MOVABLE IMAGE IS TAKEN FROM ITS PEDESTAL 

with the formula param ramhan, which is found in VMP 8,17 as follows:* param ramha ästhäsye garudam ramha ästhäzye garutmantam ramha ästhāzye sarvam sarvaramho vaispavam aham ästhäsye *"I shall attain the highest speed, I shall attain the speed of Garuda, I shall attain the speed of Garutmant ; I shall attain complete and absolute speed proper to Vişnu." It is noticeable that this formula speaks about an identification of the executor(s) of the act (probably assistants) with Garuda, the mount of Vişņu. The same identification is found in K, ch. 71, when the assistant or pupil is made to bear the bali gift. See also 87.1. M and BY give no formula here and the formula *param ramhah* on the next element. 

    परं॑ रंह॒ आस्था᳚स्ये गारु॑डं रंह॒ आस्था᳚स्ये॒ गारुत्मं॑तं॒ रंह॒ आस्था᳚स्ये । 

    सर्वं॑ सर्वरंहो॑ वैष्णवम॑हं॒ आस्था᳚स्ये ॥

### 36 THE MOVABLE IMAGE 15 ESTABLISHED ON THE BATHING PEDESTAL. 

The mantra is* pra tad vişnih stavate viryeņa mẹgo na bhimah kucaro giristhäb yasyoruşu trişu vikramapesu adhi kşiyanti bhuvananí viśva* [^48]"Vişnu is thus praised for His heroism; [He is] like a fear-inspiring animal roaming about, abiding in the mountains; in His broad three paces all creatures are living." 

[^48]:
     RV. 1,154,2; TBr. 2,4,3,1; etc. 

    प्र तद्विष्णुः॑ स्तवते वी॒र्या’य मृ॒गो न भी॒मः कु॑च॒रो गि॑रि॒ष्ठाः ।

    यस्यो॒रुषु॑ त्रि॒षु वि॒क्रम॑णेष्वधिक्षि॒यंति॒ भुव॑नानि॒ विश्वा॑ ॥

    अ॒स्त्वा॒स॒नं शु॑भं लो॒के बृ॒सी शुद्ध॑स्तपोमयम् । तप॑श्चायुस्त॑था यो॒ग म॒स्तु ते॑ पर॒मं प॒दम् ॥

36.1 The bathing pedestal is located to the north (BKh), to the north- east (BY) or to the north or east (M) of the main temple; in the first courtyard (M). BY: the two goddesses, Śrī and Bhūmi, should accompany the Lord. KAV in its description of the worship consistently gives the formulas destined for these two goddesses. 

36.2 Now some prescriptions are found in BK and BKh (and also in VMP) which do not occur in the other handbooks. Most of them are taken from the *püja *further on. At first Vişnu is welcomed to His new seat. This appears from the mantr*a viśvädkdkänam janana* (see 58) given here by VMP. It is found also in BP. VMP however adds a note by the editor, that the formulas *viśvādhikānām janana* etc. are found in some manuscripts only after the invocation. This accords not only with Marici, as the editor says, but also with the *Samhitas *of Atri and Käśyapa.

    वि॒श्वा॒दि॒कानां॒ जन॑नादि॒कर्त्रे॒ धात्रे॒ तपो॑ यज्ञ॒ सुवे॑द मू॒र्ते । 

    सु॒स्वा॒ग॒तं यत्र॑ तु॒ (तं) तत्र॒ यस्मा॒त् तत् ते॒ पदग्ꣳ॑ सू॒रिभि॒स् स्वाग॑तन्ते ॥

36.3 God's permission is asked with *mano 'bhimanta* (VMP, BP). See 59.

    म॒नो॒भि॒म॒न्ता मान॑वसु॒द्धर्मा॒ यन्॒ मातरं॒ वच॑सो॒ मान॑सेषु ।

    अ॒मो॒घो॒मो॒घं प्रति॑वेद वेद॒ (वेद्य) स्वकं॒ जना॑ना॒म् अनुमन्यतां इदम् ॥

36.4 God's feet are washed with* trini pada* (BK, BP, VMP). See 60.

    त्रीणि॑ प॒दा वि च॑क्रमे॒ विष्णु॑र्गो॒पा अदा᳚भ्यः । ततो॒ धर्मा॑णि धा॒रय॒न् ॥

36.5 Water for rinsing the mouth is given (BK, BP, VMP). See 61.

    शं नो॑ दे॒वीर॒भिष्ट॑य॒ आपो॑ भवंतु पी॒तये॑ । शं योर॒भि स्र॑वंतु नः ॥

*śám no devī́rabhíṣṭaya ā́po bhavantu pītáye ǀ śám yórabhí sravantu naḥ ǁ*

36.6 The image's teeth are brushed (BK, BKh, VMP), with the formula *annadyaya *(given by VMP only *pratikena*).

अ॒न्नाद्या॑य॒ व्यू॑हध्वमं दीर्घा॒यु र॒हम॑न्ना॒दो भू॑यासम् ॥ \

36.7 Its tongue is cleaned (BKh, VMP) with* idam brahma punimahe brahma punatu* "here we purify Brahman; Brahman should purify".

    तेन॑मे त॒प तेन॑मे ज्व॒लतेन॑मे दीदिहि॒ याव॑द्दे॒वा: ।

    इ॒दं ब्रह्म॑ पुनीमहे ब्र॒ह्म पु॑नातु ॥

36.8 Its mouth is washed (BKh, VMP) with* yan me garbhe*: *yan me garbhe vasatah papam ugram yaj jayamanasya ca kim ca dairghyam / papam jatasya yasya bhuvi vartino me tasya tat pavamanibhir aham punami /* "the frightful evil done by me when dwelling in the womb; the protracted evil done by me while I was born; the evil done by me when I was born and lived on earth, that I purify by purifying [words]."[^49]

[^49]:
     Cf. RVkh. 9,67,7.

    यन्मे॒ गर्भे॒: वस॑त: पा॒पमु॒ग्रं  य॑ज्जाय (यज्ञाय) मान स्यच॒ किंच॑ दै॒र्घ्यम् ।

	पा॒पं  जा॒तस्य॒ यस्य॒ भुवि॒वर्त॑तो मे॒ तस्य॒ तत्पा॑वमा॒नीभिर॒हम् पु॑नामि ॥

    36.9 Water for rinsing the mouth is given (BK, BKh, VMP) with* yoge yoge*. Cf. 61.

योगे॑योगे त॒वस्त॑रं॒ वाजे॑वाजे हवामहे । सखा॑य॒ इंद्र॑मू॒तये᳚ ॥ पूतस्तस्य पारे ॥ \

    36.10 A mirror is shown to the image, with *devasya tva *(BK).

दे॒वस्य॑ त्वा सवि॒तुः प्र॑स॒वे । अ॒श्विनो॑र्बा॒हुभ्या॑म् । पू॒ष्णो हस्ता॑भ्या॒ प्रति॑गृह्णामि ।  \

36.11 Mouth perfume is given with *vicakrame *(BK, BKh, VMP). See 86.

इ॒दं विष्णु॒ र्विच॑क्रमे । त्रे॒धा निद॑धे प॒दं । स मू॑ढमस्यपा॒ग्ꣳ सु॒रे ॥ \
*idaṃ viṣṇurvicakrame | tredhā nidadhe padaṃ | sa mūḍhamasyapāgṃ sure ||*

36.12 Again, water for rinsing the mouth (BKh).

36.13 The image is rubbed with a rubbing cloth (*plotam*) or fine garment (BKh). This is done probably with the formula *mitras suparnah*, which is given at this point *pratikena *by VMP. See 41, 69.

36.14 The image is clothed with a garment and an upper garment (BKh, VMP) with the formulas* tejovat* and *somasya tanur *(see 70 and 71).

36.15 Sesamum oil is taken, Soma worshipped in it (BK), the image is anointed with it (BK); the hair is cleaned with it with both hands (BKh). Formula: ato deva etc. (VMP).

36.16 Bind the locks of the image (BKh) and put a wreath on its head (BK, BKh). This is accompanied by tad visnoh paramam padam etc. (vs. 5 of ato deva; VMP).

36.17 Smear sesamum oil on the image's body with the *visnugayatri *(BKh, BP, VMP). According to BK, the image is rubbed from head to foot with perfumes or with beans or tali rice grains.

36.18 The image is fanned by means of *talavrnta *fans, with *vayu pari *(BKh, VMP). The mantra is vs. 5 of the litany to the Earth beginning with the words *medini devi *(VMP 6,10) and is read in full:* vayu pari jalasayani svayandhara saty andhopari medini / soparidhattamgaya svaha*. The language of this litany is in an unclear and high-flown style.

36.19 Place the image on an elevated spot made of rice grains (BK, BKh) with the formula *pra tad vişnu* (not found in this place in VMP). 

36.20 Fill five pitchers with water and unguents, adorn the image with perfumes and flowers, and lay down stalks of grass, unhusked grains and coconut leaves, after honouring their presiding deities (BKh). No mantras recorded. 

36.21 Again give water for the feet (BK, BKh).

 36.22 Again give water for rinsing the mouth (BK, BKh). 

37 THE IMAGE IS CLEANED (with mango leaves, BK, BKh). This is laid down by all the handbooks except BY. BP: the whole body is cleaned with mango, *khaṇḍaśikā*, and *śarkarā *(pounded gravel or candied sugar). The act is accompanied by the formula *parilikhitam rakṣaḥ parilikhitā aratayaḥ parilikhitas so 'stu yo 'smän dveşti yam ca vayam dvişmah* (VMP 8,18) "encircled is the demon, encircled are the greedy powers; encircled must be he who hates us and he whom we hate[^50]"." M gives* ise tvā ūrje tvā,* the first formula of the *Taittiriya Samhită*; it is mentioned by A as an alternative for 38 and 39 combined. 

[^50]:
     T.S. 1,2,5,1. 

    परि॑लिखित॒ꣳ॒ रक्ष: परि॑लिखिता॒ अरा॑त॒य: । 

    परि॑लिखित॒ स्सो᳚स्तु॒ यो᳚स्मान् द्वेष्टि॒यञ्च॑व॒यं द्वि॒ष्म: ॥

37.1 BP alone now gives directions for cleaning the image further with various kinds of unguents and bathing it with hot water. 

### 38 THE IMAGE IS BATHED WITH PURE WATER, 

while the following formula is recited: *variṣ catasras sadṛśaḥ kavinām patyuḥ pratyāvaritākṣaraṁ ca | bhūyo bhūtyai bhuvanasya puştyai snayitayaḥ sangatanī snāpayām*i (VMP 5,25) "four waters, equal to inspired singers[^51], turning back to their lord, came to flow; for further welfare and prosperity of the world they are washing; I wash Him who is brought into contact [with them]". 

[^51]:
     pratyāvarita translated as if pratyavartita were written in the original.

    वारी॒श्चत॑स्र स्स॒दृश॑: कवी॒नां प्र॑त्यु: प्र॒त्याव॑रिता क्ष॒दंश्च॑ । 

    भू॒यो॒ भू॒त्यै भुव॑नस्य॒ पुष्ट्यै॒ स्नायी॑तय॒ स्संग॑तं स्नपयामि ॥

### 39 THE IMAGE IS SPRINKLED WITH SWEET MILK (K, BKh, BP)

 OR WITH WATER MIXED WITH FLOWERS (A, BK). This is done with the formula *namo varuṇaś śuddho 'ham asmi śuddho brahmavīro harir yathā śuddhaḥ pañca bhūtās tathā śuddhaś śuddho "ham asmi | brahmaham asmi harir asmi rāṭ rāṭo'smi bhavam bhavāmahe* (VMP 8,18f.) "honour, I am Varuņa the pure, a pure hero of Brahman, pure like Hari, as pure as the Five Elements, pure am I; I am Brahman, I am Hari, I am the Ruler of rulers, we are Bhava (?)." 

    नमो॒वरु॑ण श्शु॒द्धशु॒द्द्धो॑हम॑स्मि । 

	शु॒द्धोब्रह्म॑ वी॒रोहरि॒र्यथा॑ शु॒द्धपञ्च॑ भूता॒ स्तथा॑ शु॒द्धाश्शु॒द्धो॑ऽहम॑स्मि ॥ 

	ब्रह्मा॒ऽहम॑स्मि॒ हरि॑रस्मि ई॒शई॒शो᳚ऽस्मि भवं॒ भवा॑महे ॥

39.1 BK now ordains that the image should be rubbed with turmeric and washed again with pure water; after water for rinsing the mouth, it should be clothed with two garments and a sacred thread, and then it should receive worship with eight attendances. No parallels are given by others on this point; but after 40, BP gives some elements which resemble those mentioned by BK here.

### 40 THE IMAGE IS BATHED WITH FRAGRANT WATER. 

The formula which is said during the act is not to be found in M and BY. It runs as follows, according to VMP 8,19:* bhür anilayā bhūtayā bhūtayd parişiñcămi bhuvas suşumnaya pranavatyä parişiñcāmi | svar amrtavatyä jyotişmatyä ca parişiñcāmi *"bhür, I sprinkle around by the Anilä and by the Bhütä; *bhuvah*, I sprinkle around by the Susumna and the Pränavati; *svah*, I sprinkle around by the Amrtavati and the Jyotişmati." The fact may attract attention that this mantra mentions some of the *nadis *or mythical veins in the body, a subject on which Šäkta and Tantric authorities have elaborated so much.

    भूर॒निल॑ या॒ भूत॑या॒ भूत॑या॒ परि॑षिंचामि॒ । 

    भुव॑स्सु षु॒म्नया॑ प्रा॒णव॑त्या॒ परि॑षिंचामि ॥ 

    स्व॑र॒मृत॑वत्य॒ जोति॑ष्म त्याच॒ परि॑षिंचामि ॥ 

    भू॒यो॒ भू॒त्यै भुव॑नस्य॒ पुष्ट्यै॒ स्नायी॑तय॒ स्संग॑तं स्नपयामि ॥

40.1 BKh now ordains a nearly complete *pûja*: God should obtain clothing, incense, a lamp, fruits etc. and a bathing with pitchers. For the next stage the priest prepares himself by performing a *punyaha*, the assignment of the alphabet, saying the penetrative mantra (*vyapaka*; nothing said about its nature), doing the stabilizing assignment (*sthitinyasa*; not explained further), meditating, and pronouncing some mantras dedicated to Visnu. Then he again bathes the image in water.

40.2 BKh proceeds by briefly describing the ceremony of placing a lamp called *nirajana*. The materials needed, besides a lamp dedicated to Šri (*śrīdīpa*-), are rice grains, coconut leaves, a wick drenched in clarified butter, fragrant water, etc. The priest should make a circumambulation of the temple thrice with the lamp in his hands. The "treasures" conch and lotus should also be carried along. The image and the treasures should be bathed four times, after which the ablution is done with pure water. The description is short and not very clear. BK alludes to the nirajana after 42 in a verse put between brackets by the editor. More about the *nirajana *is told by BP in 79.15, immediately before *havis*.

40.3 VMP gives on this point (8,19) a number of mantras, but they have little or no correspondence with the acts found in BKh. In the first place there is a mysterious occurrence of the mantra* tâm savitur varenyasa* etc., given in full.[^52] Its ritual application is unclear. Then follow the mantras *sinivāli *(destined for a bath with turmeric powder), *mitras suparnah* (for rubbing the image with a cloth),* tejovat sava* (for a garment),and further mantras for adorning the image in one manuscript; then *viṣṇor nu kam, ya akṛntan, agnim dūtam, pavitram te, trīņi pada, śam no devīḥ, tad vişnoḥ, tad viprāsaḥ, paro mātraya, viṣṇoḥ karmaņi, śam no devīḥ, sahasraśīrṣa *(the *Puruṣasūkta*), *nārāyaṇāya vidmahe* (the *Viṣṇu gāyatrī*), *trīņi pada, śam no devīḥ,* and* śubhrā jyotiḥ*. All these mantras belong to certain elements of the *pūjā *(see 60 ff.). The tendency has been to work out the bathing ceremony as a complete ceremonial worship by means of the actions described below in 57ff. 

[^52]:
     TS. 4,6,5,4a; etc,

    ताग्ंस॑वि॒तु र्वरे᳚ण्यस्य चि॒त्रामा॒ऽहंवृ॑णे सुम॒तिं वि॒श्वज॑न्याम् ।

अ॒ग्निमी॑ळे पु॒रोहि॑तं य॒ज्ञस्य॑ दे॒वमृ॒त्विजं॑ । होता॑रं रत्न॒धात॑मं ॥ \

### 41 THE IMAGE IS RUBBED WITH A PIECE OF CLOTH (*plotam*).

 This is given by all authorities, but the formula concerned is found only in BKh, BP and VMP. It runs: *mitras suparnaś candra indro 'thu rudras tvaṣṭā viṣṇus savitā gopatis tvam tvam viṣṇur bhūtāni tu trāsi daityās tvayā vṛtam jagad ulbeva garbhaḥ *"You are Mitra, Garuda, the Moon, Indra, Rudra, Tvaṣṭar, Viṣṇu, Savitr, the Herdsman; You, as Viṣṇu, terrify (?) the demons and daityas; by You the world is enveloped as an embryo by its membrane." This verse serves as vs. 12 of the litany beginning with *ekākṣaram*.[^53] 

[^53]:
     Edited as Ekākṣarapanṣipad in Sāmānya Vedānta Upaniṣad (Adyar, 1921), pp. 106 110. *Ekakshara Suktam in VMP* . *see Appendix-III Ekakshara Suktam*

मि॒त्र: सुप॒र्णश्चन्द्र॒ इन्द्रो॑ रु॒द्रस्त्वष्टा॒ विष्णु॑: सवि॒ता गोप॑ति॒स्त्वम् । \
	त्वं विष्णु॑र्भू॒तानि॑ त॒ त्रासि॒ दैत्यां॒-स्त्वया॑वृतं॒ जग॒दुल्बे॑नग॒र्भ: ॥१२॥ \
*mitraḥ suparṇaś candra indro rudras tvaṣṭā viṣṇuḥ savitā gopatis tvam | \
tvaṃ viṣṇur bhūtāni ta trāsi daityān-tvayāvṛtaṃ jagad ulbena garbhaḥ || 12 ||*

41.1 BK and BP: the image should be given another garment, water for the feet and water for rinsing the mouth. These actions partly coincide with the mantras given by VMP on 40.3. 

## Some preparations; worship of Attendant Deities 

The movable image is now prepared for receiving the presence of the Lord Himself, i.a. by connecting it with the immovable image. Around the images a great number of minor deities are thought to be present; these are all honoured with flowers. Worship is also directed to all the other deities residing in various parts of the temple. In KA and KAV (but not in the other monographs) the worship with flowers has been transferred to a later stage, during the worship of Viṣṇu. 

### 42 THE IMAGE IS AGAIN ESTABLISHED ON THE SPOT DESTINED FOR WORSHIP. 

All authorities have this accompanied by the mantra *bhūr asi bhūḥ*. VMP 8,20 gives its complete text: *bhūr asi bhūḥ pratiṣṭhityai bhuvo 'si bhuvaḥ pratiṣṭhityai suvar asi suvaḥ pratiṣṭhityai bhūr bhuvas suvar asi suvaḥ pratiṣṭhityai | sānandas sarveṣām antarātmā bhava pūtaḥ pūtāntarātmā bhava punyah punyântaratma bhava brahma brahmantaratma bhava | vişnum pratiṣṭhāpayāmi *"You are the earth; *bhūḥ*, for stability; You are intermediate space; *bhuvah*, for stability; You are heaven; *suvah*, for stability...; be the joyous Inner Self of all; be pure, a pure Inner Self; be blessing, the blessing Inner Self; be Brahman, the Brahman which is the Inner Self; I install Vişnu."

    भूर॑सि॒ भू: प्रति॑ष्टित्यै । भुवो॑ऽसि॒ भुव॒: प्रति॑ष्टित्यै । सुव॑र् असि॒ सुव॒: प्रति॑ष्टित्यै । 

    भू: भुव॒: सुव॑रसि॒ सुव॒: प्रति॑ष्टित्यै ॥

    सा॒न॒न्द: सर्वे॑षां अन्तरा॒त्मा भ॑व पू॒त: पूता᳚न्तरा॒त्मा भ॑व 

    पु॒ण्य: पुण्या᳚न्तरा॒त्मा भ॑व ब्र॒ह्मा᳚न्तरा॒त्मा भ॑व ॥

    ॐ विष्णुं प्रति॑ष्टापया॒मि । पुरुषं॒ प्रति॑ष्ठापयामि । सत्यं॒ प्रति॑ष्ठापयामि । अच्युतं॒ प्रति॑ष्ठापयामि । अनिरुद्धं॒ प्रति॑ष्ठापयामि ॥

42.1 M says: if possible, the image should be bathed using the method of the bathing ceremony. This may be a reference to the acts as described under 36.1 ff., 39.1, or 40.3. BK remarks that, if one is unable to do the bathing mentioned before, one might make use of a mirror and bathe the reflection of the image; thus said Sätätapa. No further injunctions given. 

42.2 BK.: the goddesses should not be forgotten. If one is unable to bathe the two goddesses regularly, this should be done on their festive days only.

### 43 THE IMAGE IS NOW CLOTHED AND ADORNED. 

For the mantras to be used, see 70f. BK provides more injunctions than the others, i.a. *nirajana*, royal honours, song and dance, music.

### 44 THE PRIEST FILLS THE *pranidhi *VESSEL 

with water mixed with kusa blades and unhusked rice. This should only be accompanied by the sound *om*. The prasidhi vessel (called prapira outside the Vaikhanasa ritual) is a typically Vedic feature in this worship. In Vedic ritual it is filled before the ceremony proper and then put away without being used directly. Here its water is used for the invocation of Vişnu; see 55. The *pranidhi *vessel is omitted by BY and M, probably because it was self- evident to them.

### 45 THE SITE OF THE IMMOVABLE IMAGE IS SPRINKLED

 (BK; with the water from the pranidhi vessel). This is accompanied by the *gayatri *(and not, as M says, by the *Vişnugayatri*).

### 46 A CONNECTING CORD IS LAID BETWEEN THE IMMOVABLE AND THE MOVABLE IMAGE. 

This cord is made of kuśa blades. The mantra used is the following (VMP 8,21): *samyuktam etat kzurate 'kaaram tu vyaktāvyaktam bhavate viśvam asmat | aniśa ātma badhyate bhoktṛbhāvād jäätvä devam mucyate sarvapāpaih *"here the imperishable is connected with the perishable; everything, revealed and unrevealed, originates from Him; the Self, when not autonomous, is bound by its position as an enjoyer; knowing God, it is released of all evils".

    स॒म्यु॒क्तमे॒ तत् क्ष॒रते᳚ऽ क्षरन्तु व्य॒क्तावय्क्तं॒ भव॑ते॒  विश्व॑म॒स्मात् ।

    अनी॑श आ॒त्मा बध्य॑ते भोक्तृ॒ भा॒वाद् ज्ञात्वा दे॒वं मुच्य॑ते सर्वपा॒पै᳚: ॥

46.1 BY, AN say: the blades of the cord are laid down with the tips in an eastern direction if the door is in the east or west; in a northern direction, if the door is in the north or south. BK, however, remarks that the blades should have the tips pointing in the direction of the movable image. The minor images and the images of the goddesses should also be connected in this way (BK). 

46.2 About the meaning of the act, BK and AN say this: one should imagine the temple of Visņu to be a lotus, consisting of four parts: water, mud, stalk, and flower. The temple is explained to be the water; the immovable image is the mud; the cord connecting the immovable and movable images is the stalk, and the movable image is the flower. This explanation goes to the heart of the matter: the lotus is the symbol of the unfolding of reality from the primeval source, which is Vişnu in His indivisible aspect, made concrete in the immovable image. The temple cult is a mystical representation of existence as originating from God, developing itself, and returning to God. The same is shown by the mantra in more or less philosophical language: all existence originates from the Imperishable. But existence also means a delusion of the Self. The Self should strive after knowledge of its Source in order to annihilate the delusion. - AN mentions the presiding deities of the cord: Brahma in the tips of the blades, Vişņu in their knots, and Rudra in the rest. These three gods, as the Trimürti, are responsible for the origination, preservation and destruction of existence. AN, p. 58, adds that thus as it were a staircase is made for the Lord when He is to descend from the immovable image.

###  47 THE DEITIES ARE HONOURED, GENERALLY WITH A GIFT OF FLOWERS. 

This is prescribed by all Vaikhānasa authorities on temple worship. The deities in question are partly thought to be present in the neighbourhood of the images of Vişņu, partly represented by images in other places in the temple. Some texts, notably those of the* Bhrgu Samhita*, speak of the first group as if there were real images also for them. These texts also prescribe worship for them by means of eight or eleven attendances. The names of the deities constitute an interesting list of aspects and appearances of Vişņu, often quite different from the well-known canonized ones. 

47.1 In the first place, a flower is laid down between the feet of the immovable image. This is accompanied by *vişnave namah *"honour to Visņu". The flowers are also given to the other deities while their name is pronounced in the dative, followed by the word *namah*. 

47.2 Around the immovable image, in the four main directions, beginning in the east, for the Four Manifestations: Puruṣa, Satya, Acyuta and Aniruddha. 

ॐ पुरुषाय नमः ।ॐ सत्याय नमः । ॐ अच्युताय नमः । ॐ अनिरुद्धाय नमः ।

47.3 Between these in the intermediate directions, from the southeast to the northeast, clockwise: for Kapila, Yajña, Nārāyaṇa and Puṇya.

ॐ कपिलाय नमः। ॐ यज्ञाय नमः। ॐ नारायणाय नमः। ॐ पुण्याय नमः। 

 47.4 On a second circle, in the main directions: for the Incarnations Varaha (the Boar), Narasimha (the Man-Lion), Vamana (the Dwarf), and Trivikrama (the Giant Who takes three steps).

 ॐ वाराहाय नमः ।ॐ नारसिंहाय नमः । ॐ वामनाय नमः । ॐ त्रिविक्रमाय नमः। 

 47.5 In the intermediate directions: for Subhadra, Iśitātman, Sarvo- dvaha, and Sarvavidyeśvara respectively. 

ॐ सुभद्राय नमः । ॐ ईशितात्मने नमः । ॐ सर्वोद्वहाय नमः । ॐ सर्वविद्येश्वराय नमः ।

47.6 On a third circle: for the Lokapālas or presiding deities of the regions of the sky: Indra in the east, Agni in the southeast, Yama in the south, Nirrti in the southwest, Varuna in the west, Vayu in the northwest, Kubera in the north, and Iśana in the northeast. According to M, this should be done only when the immovable image of Vişnu has been made in a standing position. 

ॐ इन्दाय नमः । ॐ यमाय नमः । ॐ वरुणाय नमः । ॐ कुबेराय नमः ।

ॐ अग्नये नमः। ॐ निर्ऋतये नमः। ॐ वायवे नमः। ॐ ईशानाय नमः ।

47.7 For the goddesses also. For Śrī with her names Śrī, Dhrti, Pavitri and Pramodāyini. For Bhumi (the Earth) with her names Hariņi, Pauṣṇi, Kṣoṇī and Mahi. The goddesses are not mentioned at this place by A and K. 

 ॐ श्रियै नमः । ॐ धृत्यैनमः ।ॐ पवित्र्यै नमः । ॐ प्रमोददायिन्यैनमः ।

ॐ हरिण्यै नमः । ॐ पौप्ट्यै नमः । ॐ क्षोण्यै नमः ।  ॐ मह्यै नमः । 

47.7.1 BK only: also for the Avatāras (Incarnations), placed in a circle. This is clearly a later addition, made in order to include the canonized number of ten Incarnations in the Vaikhanasa system. For the places of the Avatāras within a circle, see also K, ch. 37. 

47.8 Around the movable image, flowers are laid down, clockwise, beginning in the east, for Subhadra, Hayātmaka, Ramadeva (A, KA, KAV: Vāmadeva) and Puṇyadeva in the main directions, and for Sarva, Sukhavaha, Samvaha and Suvaha in the intermediate directions.

 ॐ सुभद्राय नमः। ॐ हयात्मकाय नमः । ॐ वामदेवाय नमः। ॐ पुण्यदेवाय नमः ।

ॐ सर्वाय नमः ।ॐ सुखावहाय नमः । ॐ संवहाय नमः ।ॐ सुवहाय नमः ।

 47.9 On the edges of the pedestal (BK: under the pedestal; BK, one manuscript: as bearers of the pedestal), beginning this time in the west, for Śiva, Viśva, Mitra and Atri. They are thought to face the outward direction (thus to stand with their backs towards the image). VMP: their names are said in the accusative, followed by *prapadye *"I surrender myself to".

 ॐ मित्रं प्रपद्ये । ॐ अत्रिं प्रपद्ये । ॐ शिवं प्रपद्ये । ॐ विश्वं प्रपद्ये॥ 

ॐ सनातनं प्रपद्ये। ॐ सनन्दनं प्रपद्ये । ॐ सनत्कुमारं प्रपद्ये। ॐ सनकं प्रपद्ये ।

 47.10 Between these in the intermediate directions, beginning in the northwest: for Sanatkumāra, Sanaka, Sanatana and Sanandana. These are the famous four Rṣis of the post-Vedic revelation.

 	47.11 On a third circle around the movable image, again for the Lokapālas: Indra etc. This doctrine is not found in A, and in K, M and BY only in one manuscript. The editor of VMP, however, mentions this as Marici's doctrine.

ॐ इन्द्राय नमः ।ॐ यमाय नमः ।ॐ वरुणाय नमः । ॐ कुबेराय नमः । 

ॐ अग्नये नमः ।ॐ निर्ऋतये नमः । ॐ वायवे नमः । ॐ ईशानाय नमः ।

47.12 BKh, BP: again, for Śrī and Bhūmi. 

47.13 Worship of Mārkaṇḍeya and Bhṛgu. Of these two devotees of Viṣṇu, Mārkaṇḍeya stands to the right and Bhṛgu to the left of the movable image. They face towards Viṣṇu. The images of these and of the following deities are expected to be really present.

दक्षिणे- ॐ मार्कंडेयं प्रपद्ये । उत्तरे - ॐ भृगुं प्रपद्ये । 

 47.14 Worship of Brahma and Īśa (addressed as Gaṅgādhara by VMP). Their images stand against the wall, on a line with, and looking towards, the movable image. According to K, they should be worshipped up to the guest's gifts (*arghya*). A makes no reference to Brahma and Īśa.

भित्तिपार्श्वे दक्षिणे- ॐ ब्रह्माणं प्रपद्ये । उत्तरे - ॐ गंगाधरं प्रपद्ये ।

 47.15 Worship of the deities of the door. These are six in number. Their positions are allotted by A as follows: Dhātar to the south of the door, facing the north; Vidhātar to the north of the door, facing the south[^54]; Bhuvanga (the Threshold) below the door, facing upwards. Pataṅga (the Flying One) above the door, facing downwards. Patira, facing the north; Varaṇa (this name is often spelt as Varuṇa), facing the south. 

[^54]:
     For Dhātar and Vidhātar in this milieu, cf. also Nowotny (see n. 2), p. 115. 

BK, BKh, BY: this is the assistants' work. The deities should be worshipped up to the presentation of *arghya*. — K does not mention the deities of the door. 

दक्षिणे- ॐ धात्रे नमः । उत्तरे- ॐ विधात्रे नमः । अधः- ॐ भुवंगाय नमः । ऊर्वे- ॐ पतङ्गाय नमः । दक्षिणकवाटे- ॐ पतिराय नमः । उत्तरकवाटे- ॐ वरणाय नमः ।

दक्षिणद्वारदेशे- ॐ मणिकाय नमः । उत्तरद्वारदेशे-  ॐ संध्यायै नमः ।

47.16 Worship of the doorkeepers. These personages stand two by two beside the doors. At the first door (from within): Māṇika and his wife Sandhyā. At the second door: Tāpasa and Siddhida, or Viṣṇu's Disc and Conch. At the third door: Kiṣkindha and Tīrtha.

47.17 Worship of the so-called Anapayins: Śrībhūta on the stairway of the temple, facing outwards; Garuḍa to the east of Śrībhūta, facing the Lord; then successively eastwards, the Disc, the Banner, the Conch, the Rod Yūthādhipa and the Lotus Akṣahantar. After these, worship of Viśvaksena, whose place is to the north of the temple. — M mentions only Śrībhūta, Garuḍa and Viśvaksena. A mentions only Śrībhūta and Garuḍa. K does not mention them at all. 

47.18 Worship of the guardians of the temple: Nyakṣa in the east, Vivasvān in the south, Mitra in the west, and Kṣattar in the north. They are mentioned explicitly at this place only by VMP, but are alluded to also by others. 

47.19 Worship of the guardians of the regions: Indra etc. A, M pre- scribe their worship at this place without mentioning their names; in VMP this prescription is found in some manuscripts and ascribed by its editor to a doctrine of Marīci.

 47.20 The following is added by KA and BP: the priest again enters the temple and washes the door with *bhûr anilayā *(cf. 40). Then he lays three flowers in this way: to the right (of the image), saying: "for Dharma"; in the middle, saying: "for Jñāna"; to the left, saying: "for *Aiśvarya*".[^55] Besides, one should worship to the left of all the doors Śānta "the Pacified One" (Viśvaksena) for protection.

[^55]:
     These divine qualities usually occur in the number four, by addition of *vairagya *"equanimity". Although *vairagya *is found indeed in K, ch. 35, the occurrence of only three terms here may be a hint of the fact that the first three are original, while *vairagya *has been added later.

47.21 BY gives a division of the attendant gods. They are twofold: those who are desirous of pūjā and those who are desirous of *bali*. In the morning worship, both these groups should be worshipped; on the other occasions, it is sufficient to serve those who long for *bali*.

## Invocation of Viṣṇu (Āvāhana)

### 48 PREPARATION OF THE VESSELS AND OTHER MATERIALS.

 This subject is handled best by BKh. The vessels were already said to be cleaned in 19. They are called "conches" (*śaṅkha*-) by some authorities (A, BK, BKh). There are four of them: one for the invocation (the *pranidhi *proper); it is placed to the right; one for water for Viṣṇu's feet; one for water to sip (*ācamana*), and one for bathing. The four vessels are placed successively to the north of each other. They are filled with water mixed with flowers, kuśa grass, grains, and perfumes.

48.1 Besides these, there are five vessels for guests' gifts (*arghya*), to be made of different kinds of metal (M). Arghya consists of eight elements: pure water, water mixed with kuśa grass, *siddhārtha *(white mustard), sesamum, rice grains, husked and roasted grains, sweet milk and curds (K, BKh). BY refers for the discussion of the vessels to BKh.

48.2 The other utensils and materials are specified by KA as follows: flowers, perfumes (aloe, costus, *uśīra*), incense, lamps, ghee, sesamum oil (the last two for the lamps), a parasol, a yak's tail, a fan, a mirror, pots, lamps for protection during the dark, and all kinds of musical instruments.

48.3 Each kind of material has its presiding deity. One should meditate on them as bearing the material in question (BK) and worship them (this worship is to be done by assistants). The presiding deities are i.a. (as given by AN, p. 36): Soma of the vessels, Varuṇa of the water, Dharma of the seat, the Earth of the perfume, Bṛhaspati of the incense, Śrī of the lamp, the Sun of the guests' gifts, Vāyu of the whisk, Sāmaveda of the songs.

### 49 A SCREEN IS PLACED BETWEEN THE IMAGE AND THE OUTSIDE.

 This screen (called yavanika by some) is placed across the doorway. It is made preferably of linen (BP). The act is done in order that persons who are unworthy will not see the worship while it is being performed. Such persons are; outcastes, spoilers of the Veda, heretics, those afflicted with infirmities or diseases, those who are under the rules of a *diksa *(BY), those who have incurred great guilt, and women. 

### 50 THE PRIEST'S WAY OF SITTING DURING THE INVOCATION.

 The priest sits on God's right hand, facing the east or north, kneeling on one knee, or in the pose called *svastika*[^56]. He sits on a cushion called *kurmasana *or *kurmavistara *(tortoise seat). This object is made of leaves, preferably from the *bilva *or *aśvattha*, two *hastas *long and wide, and six *angulas *high (BK). Its form may be round, square, or shaped like a tortoise (AN). 

[^56]:
     The svastika pose is described thus by AN, p. 43: janurvor antare samyak kritvā pādatale ubhe | rjukāyes samasinas svastikāsanam ucyate "the svastika pose is formed by sitting with the body upright, and placing the soles of the feet tightly between knees and thighs".

### 51 THE PRIEST RECITES THE *Atmaśukta *

or "hymn of the Self". This is a rather obscure, but highly interesting hymn in nine verses, found only in the books of the Vaikhānasas (VMP 5,49). It stresses the identity of the reciter's body with the cosmos, mainly by an identification of each limb of that body with constituents of the cosmos. See Appendix-IV Atmasūkta. 

### 52 THE PRIEST MEDITATES ON THE DIVISIBLE HIGHEST SELF 

(*sakalaparamatma*). BK and BKh say: meditation on Visnu. This meditation should be regarded as a necessary completion of the concentration on Brahman (identical with Visnu's indivisible, *nişkala*, aspect) performed before (group C). God will now be requested to make a further step towards the human world by taking up His abode in the movable image, in His divisible aspect. Thus the world, represented by the priest, will be able to converse with Him. The priest now concentrates on Visnu as being golden of colour, with red mouth and red eyes, wearing a garment with the colour of a parrot's feathers, with four arms, and wearing all kinds of ornaments. This meditation is not described with a verse in *kavya *style, as is often the case in the *Agamas *and *Tantras*, but in regular slokas (these slokas resemble each other very much in those handbooks which are written in sloka). The element is old: it is found in similar wordings already in V, where it is the first act after 21. In KA this meditation is found immediately after the preparation of the priest described in group C, together with many additions.

    ॐ सुवर्ण वर्णं रक्तास्यं रक्तनेत्रं पाणिपादम् सुखोद्वहं ।

### 53 ASSIGNMENT (*nyasa*) OF THE *vyährti *ON THE MOVABLE IMAGE.

 The three parts of the* vyahrti, suvar, bhuvar,* and *bhur*, containing the essence of heaven, atmosphere and earth respectively, are fixed on the image's head, navel and feet (by means of a gesture).

यकारं पादयोरं तरे पीठे विन्यस्य अं नम: ।

अकारं हृदये तं प्रणवेन वेष्ट यित्वा ॐ नम: ।

हृदये प्रणवेन आदिबीजाक्षरं च ॐ ‘अं’ 

पाद मध्ये पीठे यकारं विनस्य यं 

53.1 KAV gives particulars about the formula's parts and their concrete shape (they bear i.a. a sword, rod and flower respectively in their hands). One should meditate on these figures.

### 54 ASSIGNMENT OF THE PRIMEVAL SYLLABLE ON THE IMAGE'S HEART AND OF THE SYLLABLE *ya *BETWEEN ITS FEET.

 This is described by all handbooks except V. The primeval syllable (*adibija*) is the syllable *a*. This is argued by A: see 30. A also adds that the syllable *om* may also be called the primeval syllable (*bījāksara*), because it is the beginning of all the Vedas.

54.1 BK: the syllable *a* has the colour of smoke, has two arms, a red garment, and the lustre of a *kadamba* flower. Meditate also on the deity of the syllable a: Visņu, enclosed by the Vaibhava Sakti (Expansive Energy), with four arms, supreme, bearing conch and disc, and wearing a yellow garment. BKh: meditate on Visņu's Sakti. A mentions Visņu's Sakti in the next element.

Bhrigu Samhita, Kriyadhikara, 54.2

अकारं धूम्रवर्णं च द्विभुजं रक्तवाससम् । कदम्बपुष्पवर्णाभं ध्यायेद्वागीश्वरीं पराम् ॥

*akāraṃ dhūmravarṇaṃ ca dvibhujaṃ raktavāsasam |  \
kadambapuṣpavarṇābhaṃ dhyāyedvāgīśvarīṃ parām ||*

Meaning: "One should meditate on the syllable a (akāraṃ) as having a smoky color (dhūmravarṇaṃ), two arms (dvibhujaṃ), and a red garment (raktavāsasam), with the radiant lustre of a kadamba flower (kadambapuṣpavarṇābhaṃ); this is the form of the supreme Vagishvari (Goddess of Speech, Sarasvati)."

Verse 2: Deity of the Syllable

This verse describes the presiding deity who resides within the syllable a.

Source: Bhrigu Samhita, Kriyadhikara, 54.3

विष्णुमक्षरदेवं च वैभव्या शक्त्याऽऽवृतम् ।चतुर्भुजं परं पीतवस्त्रं शङ्खचक्रधारिणम् ॥

*viṣṇumakṣaradevaṃ ca vaibhavyā śaktyā''vṛtam |  \
caturbhujaṃ paraṃ pītavastraṃ śaṅkhacakradhāriṇam ||*

Meaning: "(Within that akāra, one should meditate on) Vishnu, the deity of the syllable (viṣṇumakṣaradevaṃ), who is enveloped by the Vaibhavi Shakti. He is supreme, with four arms (caturbhujaṃ paraṃ), wears a yellow garment (pītavastraṃ), and is the bearer of the conch and discus (śaṅkhacakradhāriṇam)."

54.2 According to most sources, the syllable a should be surrounded with *praṇavas*. The same is prescribed by A for the priest on 30.

54.3 About the syllable *ya*, BK says that it should be meditated upon as Vayu embodied. The syllable should be assigned also to the pedestal. Nothing is explained about this syllable by the other authors.

### 55 THE PRIEST LIFTS UP THE *pranidhi *VESSEL AND INVOKES VIṢŅU INTO IT, 

out of the immovable image. BKh alone says that the *Sakti *should be imagined (*sankalpa*) and placed into the *pranidhi*. BP: Hari has the *praṇava *(the syllable *om*) as His nature, is unmanifest and His appearance is of divine beauty. The invocation from the immovable image into the pranidhi is done just as one lamp is kindled from another. —- A: the priest should take the *pranidhi *vessel with the left hand and with the right hand make a gesture symbolizing the arrival of Visņu into it. K: The priest should lift up the *pranidhi *vessel with hands and face directed upwards.

### 56 VISŅU IS INVOKED FROM THE *pranidhi *VESSEL INTO THE MOVABLE IMAGE. 

This is done by means of a blade or bundle of *kuśa *grass. The water is made, with the help of the grass, to trickle down on the image's head. In the meanwhile the priest says: "I invoke Vişņu, I invoke Puruşa, I invoke Satya, I invoke Acyuta, I invoke Aniruddha", in the main directions, beginning in the east, clockwise (cf. 47.2).---- Already before these words (VMP, A, M) two mantras are addressed to Vişņu*: idam vişnur*[^57] and* ayatu bhagavan*. VMP 8,21: *ayatu bhagavan purusas saganas sasainyas saśrisahāyas saha devatābhir anumanyatam *"the Lord, the Primeval Man should come, accompanied by His retinue, by His army, by Śrī and His attendants; together with the gods He should consent".

[^57]:
     Verse 2 of ato deva etc. (see 7). 

    इ॒दं विष्णु॒र्वि च॑क्रमे त्रे॒धा नि द॑धे प॒दं ।समू॑ळ्हमस्य पांसु॒रे ॥

    आयातु भगवान् पुरुष: सगण: ससैन्य: सश्रीर्सहाय: स: देवताभिर् अनुमन्यताम् ॥

    यस्तु गरुड रधो नित्यं ऋषिभिश्चानुगामिनं तमजं पुण्डरीकाक्षं भगवन्तम् ओम् ॥

*āyātu bhagavān puruṣa: sagaṇa: sasainya: saśrīrsahāya: sa: devatābhir anumanyatām ॥ yastu garuḍa radho nityaṃ ṛṣibhiścānugāminaṃ tamajaṃ puṇḍarīkākṣaṃ bhagavantam om ॥*

    विष्णुं॒ आवा॑हयामि । पुरुष॒मावा॑हयामि । सत्य॒मावा॑हयामि । अच्युत॒मावा॑हयामि । अनिरुद्ध॒मावा॑हयामि ।

*viṣṇuṃ॒ āvā॑hayāmi । puruṣa॒māvā॑hayāmi । satya॒māvā॑hayāmi । acyuta॒māvā॑hayāmi । aniruddha॒māvā॑hayāmi ।*

 56.1 At this point, KAV introduces the doctrine of the kalah or power particles so well known in Saiva and Śrīvaisņava ritual and theology. For reasons of space this will not be discussed here. 

56.2 AN, p. 64: when Vişņu has been invoked into the movable image, yet he remains present in the immovable image, just as a lamp keeps on burning also when other lamps have been kindled from it. Vişņu is caused to flame up in the image by means of the mantra, just as a fire in the fire-pit is 'caused to flame up by the wind. The invocation should be in- toned with devotion (bhakti); then Vişņu will descend into the movable image out of compassion for His devotees (for the last doctrine AN refers to Atri). 

56.3 Also the goddesses Śri and Hariņi (the Earth) and the minor images (festival image etc.) are enlivened by invocation (cf. 56.1, where they have been connected with Visqu's immovable image). KAV gives formulas for these acts, and also for the worship of the two goddesses (the present discussion is restricted to Vişņu himself). M, BK: according to some authorities, the invocation into the minor images is unnecessary during daily worship. It can be done in the cases when they are expressly needed.

56.4 KA: the presence of God is brought over into the kautuka image for 1/6 part (of its completeness as present in the immovable image); into the utsava image for 1/7 part; into the bathing image for 1/8 part; into the the bali image for 1/10 part; into the pedestal for 1/12 part. 

## Worship of  Vişņu 

The daily worship of Vişņu is performed, according to the handbooks, in the form of a *puja *ceremony of thirty-two attendances, during which Vişņu is received and honoured as a royal guest, together with a homa or fire offering (81) and a bali or tribute (82). It is present in its elementary form already in V. Of the handbooks, BKh and especially BK add a number of new elements. The number is further increased in the later monographs such as KA and BP. Another characteristic of these works is that they sometimes also modify the sequence of the elements and thus have abandoned the structure of the *pūjā *system as described in the handbooks. Instead, they divide the *pūjā *into a number of *āsanas *(seats), on which the God is entertained at different places and in different ways. Thus, KA knows the *mantrasana, snānāsana, alamkārāsana, bhojyāsana, homa, yātrāsana*, while KAV adds the *paryankāsana *at the end. In some places, KA has restored the order of elements as found in V, which had been departed from in the handbooks. Each action is performed at the end of or during the mantra said for it. During each attendance a bell should be rung (A, BK), otherwise the demons take the merit of the *pūjā *(BK). AN specifies four kinds of attendances: the object presented may be visible, touchable, audible or edible. These are specified further.

### MANTRASANA 

#### 57 PREPARATION OF A SEAT FOR VIṢŅU.

 This is found in V also. The seat is prepared with *kuśa *grass stalks or flowers. Its place is on the edge of the pedestal (A, B, M).[^59] Two formulas are mentioned: at first,* pra tad viṣṇu*[^60] (prescribed by all except BKh and BY). The second formula, *astv asanam*, is post-Vedic, not mentioned in V, but prescribed by all others: *astv asanam śubham loke bhrśaśuddham tapomayam tapai cayus tatha yogam astu te paramam padam *"a beautiful seat should exist for You in the world, most pure, consisting of ascetical energy; ascetical energy, longevity, and yoga should be yours, and also the highest abode". -M adds: the priest should meditate on God as seating Himself on the seat, thinking: "there You should seat yourself".

[^59]:
     This might seem an unnecessary act, because Vişņu is already present in the image. The preparation of the seat of grass is, however, a continuance of the usage of the Veda. 

[^60]:
     See 2

    प्र तद्विष्णुः॑ स्तवते वी॒र्या॑य मृ॒गो न भी॒मः कु॑च॒रो गि॑रि॒ष्ठाः ।

    यस्यो॒रुषु॑ त्रि॒षु वि॒क्रम॑णेष्वधिक्षि॒यंति॒ भुव॑नानि॒ विश्वा॑ ॥२॥

	तप॑श्चायुस्त॑था यो॒ग म॒स्तु ते॑ पर॒मं प॒दम् ॥ \

57.1 For all the attendances, KAV gives also the formulas for the worship of the goddesses, Śrī and Bhūmi; for Śrī they are taken from the* Śrīsūkta*[^61] (RVKhila 5,87) and for Bhūmi mostly from the litany found in TS. 1,3,5,1. Also Viṣṇu's minor images may be attended to (M, BKh on 79).

[^61]:
      See Appendix-, Sri Suktam

#### 58 WELCOME IS SAID TO VIṢŅU 

by means of the formula *viśvādhikānām jananadikartre dhatre tapoyajñasuvedamūrte survāgatam yatra tu tatra yasmat tat te padam sūribhis svāgatam te* (VMP 8,18). This is a good specimen of Vaikhānasa poetic style. Even if the endings of -*kartre* and *dhatre *in the first half are considered as corruptions of the vocatives -*kartar* and *dhatar*, the whole verse does not abound in clarity. What might have been meant is this: "O Creator of all excellent ones (-*adika* = adhika-?), O primeval Creator, O Institutor, O Personification of ascetical energy, sacrifice, and the excellent Veda; that place is yours, from which a cordial welcome is given to You by the officiants." The element is non- existent in V and K.A. 

    वि॒श्वा॒दि॒कानां॒ जन॑नादि॒कर्त्रे॒ धात्रे॒ तपो॑ यज्ञ॒ सुवे॑द मू॒र्ते । 

    सु॒स्वा॒ग॒तं यत्र॑ तु॒ (तं) तत्र॒ यस्मा॒त् तत् ते॒ पदग्ꣳ॑ सू॒रिभि॒स् स्वाग॑तन्ते ॥

#### 59 VIṢŅU'S PERMISSION IS ASKED. 

Not in V, KA. The formula said is* mano 'bhimantă mānavas sudharmā yan mataram vacaso manasesu / amoghamoghum prativedavedas svakarm janānām anumanyatām idam* (VMP 8,18). This mantra, in which sound-play has a prominent role, is so obscure, that a translation is not ventured on here. The last words show that indeed permission is requested. 

    म॒नो॒भि॒म॒न्ता मान॑वसु॒द्धर्मा॒ यन्॒ मातरं॒ वच॑सो॒ मान॑सेषु ।

    अ॒मो॒घो॒मो॒घं प्रति॑वेद वेद॒ (वेद्य) स्वकं॒ जना॑ना॒म् अनुमन्यतां इदम् ॥

#### 60 WATER FOR WASHING THE FEET IS OFFERED. 

This is also prescribed by V. Two formulas are said:* trini padā*[^62] and* indro 'bhimantă manavo vayavaś cápas samagra abhito yasya dadyāt viṣṇo imān vaiṣṇavāms tarpayāmi prasida devādhika tejasainam* (VMP 8,30) "Indra gives his consent, the Manus and the Vāyus, that he (the priest?) will place all waters around him, who... O Viṣṇu, I satisfy these Viṣṇuite beings; O Foremost of the gods, be gracious to him (the priest?) by Your energy." This second formula is not found in V. 

[^62]:
     Vs. 3 of ato deva etc. (see 7).

    विष्णो॑ इ॒मान् वै᳚ष्ण॒वाग्ं स्त॑र्पयामि॒ प्रसी॑द दे॒वाधि॑क॒तेज॑ सैनम् ॥

60.1 A, K, BK, BKh say, that the water for the feet should be touched beforehand with the formula* tvam stri*. VMP 8,30* tvam stri tvam pumān asi tvam deva kumāra idam nadah kumāri | tvam jirnar tvam gacchasi tvam jato nīvāsir viśvatomukhaḥ* "You are woman, You are man, You, O God, are here a young man and (nadi?) there a young lady; You are the decrepit (one), you go...; You might take Your abode (in this water? the form *nīvāsir *is quite irregular), possessing faces on all sides."

60.2 Only KA(V) now prescribes guest's gifts, accompanied by the formulas ā ma vājasya and trir devāh. See 66.

#### 61 WATER FOR RINSING THE MOUTH OFFERED. 

This water is brought to the image's right hand by means of stalks of kuśa grass. The act is mentioned also by V, together with the formula sam no devīḥ, given likewise by all others. [^63]

[^63]:
      RV. 10,9,4; AV. (Paipp.) 1,1,1; TBr. 1,2,1,1; etc. 

    शं नो॑ दे॒वीर॒भिष्ट॑य॒ आपो॑ भवंतु पी॒तये॑ । शं योर॒भि स्र॑वंतु नः ॥

*śám no devī́rabhíṣṭaya ā́po bhavantu pītáye ǀ śám yórabhí sravantu naḥ ǁ*

61.1 To the Four Manifestations, this water is given with the formulas *apo hi stha, yoge yoge, samane vṛkşe* and *pavitram te.*[^64]

[^64]:
     Respectively: RV. 10,9,1, TBr. 3,9,7,5 etc. (see 68); TS. 4,1,2,d etc.; *Śveṭāśvaṭara Upanisad *4,7 etc.; RV. 9,83,1, TĀP. 1,11,1 etc. M, after el. 79, says that all objects should be given to Vişņu with the recitation of His *mūrtimantras *(i.e. the names of the Five Manifestations). When offering in this way, the worshipper should imagine that everything is fivefold.

#### 62 FLOWERS ARE OFFERED. 

Prescribed by V and all others. They all mention here the formula *tad viṣṇoḥ paramam padam*.[^65] Only V does not give the second formula:* imāḥ sumanasaś śreṣṭhā divyapuşpadhivāsitāḥ / pūtā brahmapavitreņa pūtās sūryasya raśmibhiḥ* "Here are excellent flowers, fumigated by divine flowers; purified by the purifier which is Brahman, purified by the sun's rays." [^66]According to BK, the flowers are put on the image's head, while those for the Four Manifestations are laid on the pedestal.

    तद्विष्णोः᳚ पर॒मं प॒दग्ꣳ सदा॑ पश्यंति सू॒रयः॑ । दि॒वी॑व॒ चक्षु॒ रात॑त॒ग॒ꣳ ॥

62.1 BP: worship Hari with the (twelve) names Keśava etc., or with 108 names, or with 1008, or with an endless number, for Hari has an endless number of names.[^67]

[^67]:
     SEE APPENDIX-II

62.2 After 61, V continues with the bath (68). KA now continues with mouth-perfume (86), after which the five attendances of *mantrāsanam *are considered to be closed. It proceeds, like V, with the bath, here called *snānāsanam*. After the bath, comes the dressing up etc. of the image, combined with the elements 63ff. into the *alamkārāsanam*.

#### 63 PERFUMES ARE OFFERED

 and the part of the image above the navel is rubbed with them (A, M, BKh). Given by all, including V. There are two formulas of which V again mentions only the first: *tad viprāsaḥ.*[^68] The second one runs as follows (VMP 8,30):* ime gandhās surabhino divya- gandhadhivāsitāḥ / pūtā brahmapavitreņa pūtās sūryasya raśmibhiḥ* "here are perfumes, fragrant and fumigated by divine perfumes ..." etc., just as the verse for the flowers in 62.

#### 64 INCENSE IS OFFERED.

 For this act three formulas are found in the tradition. The first, *paro mātrayā*,[^69] is prescribed by V and all others except BK and BKh. The second is found in all the handbooks except BY, but not in V. VMP does not mention it either on this point. In KAV it is given in full: *bṛhaspatir devānām imam yajñam bṛhato me dadatu | bṛhaspativitaye*[^70]* *"Bṛhaspati must grant me this sacrifice from the solid principle; for the feast of Bṛhaspati." Bṛhaspati in fact is the presiding deity of the incense (48.3). The third formula,* ime dhūpāḥ,* is found only in M, KA and VMP 8,31. It is an exact replica of* ime gandhāḥ* cited in 63.

#### 65 A LAMP IS PUT BESIDE THE IMAGE. 

Given by all including V. There are two formulas: *vişnoh karmaṇi*[^71]* *"see the works of Vişnu..." (this one mentioned also by V) and *śubhrā jyotiḥ* (VMP 5,25): *śubhrā jyotis ca devānām tejaś ca satataprabhaḥ prabhāskaro mahātejā dīpo 'yam prati- gṛhṇītām*. The most likely translation seems to be: "accept this shining lamp of great lustre; it is the auspicious light of the gods and fiery energy of eternal lustre". This involves the use of *jyotis *as a feminine (always neuter) and of *tejas *as a masculine (always neuter). The second difficulty has been avoided by KAV, where the mantra is found also. Pāda b is read there as* tejaś ca satatam prabho* "... and eternal lustre (of the gods), O Lord!"

66.2 All handbooks except BK and BY say that the* arghya* should be touched beforehand with the formula* agnir indra*. This mantra is not found in VMP on this point. It is rather corrupt and peculiar to the Vaikhānasas.[^75]

66.3 BP: of all attendances, arghya is most dear to Hari. It should be prepared in the method of the *madhuparka *mixture (see also No. 48.1).

####  67 FOR THE SECOND TIME, WATER FOR RINSING THE MOUTH. 

Prescribed by all including V. The formula is as above (61).

*śám no devī́rabhíṣṭaya ā́po bhavantu pītáye ǀ śám yórabhí sravantu naḥ ǁ*

#### 68 THE IMAGE IS BATHED. 

Prescribed by all including V. The formula used is *iṣe tvā ūrje tvā*.[^76] M and BY however mention the formula* apo hi sthā*:[^77] *āpo hi sthā mayobhuvas tā na ūrje dadhātana mahe raṇāya cakṣase *"O Waters, You are indeed refreshing, give us the faculty for strength, in order that we behold great joy."

    तस्मा॒ अर॑ङ्गमाम व: यस्य॒ क्षया॑य॒ जिन्व॑थ । आपो॑ ज॒नय॑था च न: ॥

68.1 KA has added in its description a number of attendances during this bathing; thus shoes are put in front of the image, its teeth are cleaned, its tongue is cleaned (then KAV: its mouth is washed), it is smeared with sesamum oil, and rubbed with various fragrant products. These acts are accompanied by Vedic mantras. Cf. also 36.6-36.15.

68.2 KA: the bathing can be done with the *puruṣasūkta*. Here we see influence from other schools, where this Hymn to the Primeval Man (RV. 10,90) may be used for this ceremony or for other parts of the *pūjā*. The *puruṣasūkta *is given *pratikena *also by VMP.

68.3 A detailed description of the bathing outside the cadre of the pūjā is found above (34-41).

#### 69 THE IMAGE IS RUBBED WITH A PIECE OF CLOTH. ( *plota vastram*)

Prescribed by all ex- cept V. The formula used is* mitras suparṇaḥ* (see 41).

69.1 Here begins the *alaṁkārasanam *according to KA. See 62.2.

### Alaṁkārasanam

#### 70 THE IMAGE IS CLOTHED WITH A GARMENT. 

Prescribed by all including V. The formula used is *tejovat savas* (VMP syāvas)* savituḥ prasave 'śvinor bāhubhyām pūṣṇo hastābhyām paridadhami* (VMP 8,32) "Instigation combined with energy; at the instigation of God Savitar, by the arms of the Aśvins, by the hands of Pūṣan I put around." This is a Vaikhānasa variant of *devasya tvā savituḥ prasave *etc., well known in various variations in the Veda (see the *Vedic Concordance *s.v.).

    तेजो॒ वत्स्या॑व स्सवि॒तु: प्र॑स॒वे᳚ऽश्विनो᳚र् ब॒हुभ्यां᳚ पू॒ष्णो हस्ता᳚भ्यां ॥

#### 71 THE IMAGE OBTAINS AN UPPER GARMENT. 

The formula is *somasya tanūr asi tanuvam me pāhi | sā ma tanūr āviśa śivā me tanūr āviśa* "you are Soma's body, protect my body; that body – enter me; an auspicious body – enter me."[^79]

The formula is* bhūto bhūteṣu carati pravispas sa bhūtānām adhipatir babhūva tasya mṛtyau carati rājasūyam sa rājā rājyam anumanyatam idam *"the Being goes around, having entered into living beings; for Him, death (*mṛtyuḥ*, reading of AV 4,8,1) performs the *rājasūya *ceremony; that King should give His consent to this kingdom."[^80] Viṣṇu is indeed to be honoured as the universal King.

73.1 It is to be noted that this ceremony of clothing and adorning is akin to the acts which are to be performed by the Veda student who returns home after finishing his studies; cf. *Vaikhānasa Gṛhyasūtra* 2,13, end, and also 2,14, where also the formulas of 68, 70 and 71 occur.

73.2 M, BY: if no ornaments are available, God may be adorned with flowers only. One should then meditate on the respective ornaments as being applied to the image.

    प्र॒भा॒ऽस्करो महा ते॒जा॒ दी॒पो यं॑ प्रति॒गृह्य॑ताम् ॥ 

*śubhrā jyotiś ca devānāṃ tejaś ca satata-prabhaḥ  \
prabhās-karo mahā-tejā ‘yaṃ pratigṛhyātām*

79.1 M, BK, BY prescribe now, for the fourth time, a gift of water for rinsing the mouth.

79.2 Now follow a number of attendances called by BK *rājavigrahāḥ *"royal honours". During these, Viṣṇu's glorification as heavenly King is executed in detail. The elements are found in only one handbook, BK, and further in BP and KA. Also AN mentions them, but this text only elucidates some aspects (mainly the material) of the ritual. VMP gives a few mantras which also presuppose some of these acts. The information found in all these sources is however rather different. Only a cursory view is taken below. 

79.3 Guests' gifts are offered to Vişņu and the Manifestations (KA, VMP). See 66. 

79.4 A sunshade is held above the image (BK, BP, KA) with the formula* somam rājānam* (KA). For the formula, see 14. 

सोम॒ꣳ॒ राजा॑नं॒ वरु॑णम॒ग्निम॒न्वार॑भामहे । 

आ॒दि॒त्यान् वि॑ष्णु॒ꣳ॒ सूर्यं॑ ब्र॒ह्माणं॑ च॒ बृह॒स्पति᳚म् ॥

*ā॒di॒tyān viṣṇu॒ꣳ॒ sūryaṃ॑ brahmāṇaṃ॑ ca॒ bṛhaspati᳚m ॥*

79.5 A fan is used for fanning the image (BK, BP, KA). This is done with the formula* marutaḥ paramātmā* (KA). This mantra is found in VMP not at this place but in 6,20: *marutaḥ paramātmā paramā gatiḥ param brahma param yogam paramātmānam manye ajaram yo 'gnir aham annam* "I am sure that fire is the Highest Self of the Marut (Wind), its highest Resort, the highest Brahman, the highest Yoga; the highest Self, eternally young and vigorous; I am food." If this translation is correct, fire, and in second instance wind, are seen as active operators in the process of existence, resorting in Brahman; the worshipper sees him- self as passive in the eternal process of production and consumption. One might compare the famous *annasūkta*. [^82]

[^82]:
     See Appendix-V

    म॒रुत॑: पर॑मा॒त्मा पर॑मा ग॒ति: परं॒ ब्रह्म॒ परं योगं᳚ 

    प॒रमा॒त्मानं॑ मन्ये अ॒जरं॒ यो॑᳚ऽग्निर॒हमन्नं॑ वा॒यवे॒ स्वाहा॑᳚ ॥

79.6 A mirror is held before the image (BK, BP, KA). Formula:* devasya tvā *(KA). Cf. 70.

दे॒वस्य॑ त्वा सवि॒तुः प्र॑स॒वे । अ॒श्विनो॑र्बा॒हुभ्या॑म् । पू॒ष्णो हस्ता॑भ्या॒ प्रति॑गृह्णामि । 

 79.7 A whisk (*vyajana*-) is moved in front of the image (BK, BP). 

79.8 Next comes a preliminary gift of grains (*mātrādānam*, BP). It is described differently and not very clearly in BP and KA. The gift consists of rice-grains in the quantity of a *droṇa *("bucket") or half or a quarter of that, mixed up with sesamum and fruits. The *mātrā *gift is shown before- hand to God while the formula *somam rājānam* is said (BK, BP, AN; also VMP gives this formula here). According to KA, the image's right hand should be made to touch it. Then it should be given to the *ācārya *or *arcaka*, who should be considered as being Hari (AN). This last remark shows that the *mātrādāna *is essentially thought to be a gift by the *yajamāna *(organizer or sponsor of the sacrifice or temple worship). BP goes somewhat deeper into this matter: the *yajamāna *should hand this gift over to the worshipping priest, who is a Vaikhānasa. If he takes it for his own family, he is a robber of Hari's share. It is called by the Śāstras a fault to enjoy the products destined for God. But this fault is not reckoned as such to the Vaikhānasa, thanks to God's grace. The *mātrā *gift is made while reciting the formula* ghṛtāt pari*, given by VMP here by means of the first words only. The mantra is very obscure (see *Vaikhānasa Gṛhyasūtra, *trans. Caland, p. 16, n. 8). The *arcaka *accepts the gift, saying *devasya tvā.* - It is interesting that BP once calls the *mātrā *gift by the word *dakṣiṇā*.[^83]

[^83]:
     For the dakṣiṇā in the Vedas, see J. C. Heesterman, "Reflections on the significance of the dakṣiṇā", Indo-Iranian Journal, III (1959), pp. 241-258. The dakṣiṇā occurs also in the present survey as 89.

79.9 A bow is made to the image while the priest says the first mantras from the four Vedas (BP, VMP).

79.10 KA prescribes a gift of all kinds of fruits and desserts accompanied by the formula* a vata vāhi bheṣajam.*[^84]

[^84]:
     AV. 10,137,3; TBr. 2,4,1,7; etc.

79.11 Mouth-perfume (*mukhavāsa*) with the formula *vicakrame*[^85]* *(KA).

[^85]:
     See 86.

79.12 Flowers are offered (BP, KA).

79.13 Recitation of sacred texts from the Veda (BK). This text inserts a verse between brackets which ordains recitation also from the Purāṇas and hymns in regional languages (bhāṣābhedaiḥ). KA: recitation with parts from the Vedas, Purāṇas, Mīmāṃsā and stotras (post-Vedic hymns of praise); to this list KAV adds the *Paramātmikopaniṣad *(VMP 7).

79.14 Song, dance and music are performed for God's entertainment (KA, BP).

79.15 The ceremony called nīrājana (see also 40.2) is prescribed by BP. A lamp is put down in front of the image; Varāha, Narasiṃha, Vāmana and Trivikrama are invoked on its sides; Lakṣmī in the lamp itself, Śrī in the wick, Bhava (Rudra) in the smoke. The lamp is sprinkled and worshipped with perfumes, flowers etc. Then it is taken with the formula śubhrā jyotiḥ (see 65), and led thrice clockwise around Hari. A pupil or dancing-girl puts it, with the accompaniment of music, in front of the temple on the way of approach "behind *Yūthādhipa*" (see 47.17). Beholding this lamp grants success, a long life and lustre (*śrī*) to the public and children to women.

### Bhojyasanam

#### 80 A COOKED OFFERING (havis) IS PREPARED AND GIVEN TO THE IMAGE. 

About this important act (*havis* must be considered the God's main meal), V only says: "one should give havis with the formula* tad asya* *priyam*". The others give details of the method of preparation. KA says that the *bhojyāsana *"eating seat" should be prepared. The cooking should take place in the cooking hall (*pācanālaya*) which is located in one of the courtyards (AN). There are six kinds of *havis*, according to the kinds of grains used for it and their mixture (K, ch. 75; AN, p. 78).

80.1 A honeydish (*madhuparka*) is given first (BK, BP, KA). This mixture is prepared with the help of ghee, honey, sweet milk, curds, molasses etc.; or with curds only (BK). According to BK, the formula employed here is* agnim iſe*[^86], but BP, KA and also VMP mention* yan madhuno madhavyam*, given in full at this place by KAV only:* yan madhuno madhavyam paramam annadyam viryam tenäham madhuno madhavyena paramenánnädyena viryeṇa paramo 'nnādo 'sani tejase tvā śriyai yaśase balāyānnādyāya prāśnāmi *[^87]"May I be the supreme Eater of food by means of that which is sweeter than honey, the supreme food and heroism; I eat you for fiery energy, lustre, glory, strength and food." 

[^86]:
     RV. 1,1,1. 

[^87]:
     See M. Bloomfield, A Vedic Concordance, p. 763, where a number of variants are given. 

80.2 Water for rinsing the mouth (BP, KA). 

80.3 A site is prepared by smearing with cowdung. This is prescribed by all. This site (*mandalam*) is quadrangular (BP, KA). The act is accompanied by the formula *athava nitam paramam pavitram suraſ aviryad itam astu rakṣaḥ | ayantu devān pitṛbhir vidhatte asmin sthale sannidhidattalipte* (thus KAV) "now the supreme purifier has been brought down; by the heroism of the Lord of the gods the demons have to flee away; the gods together with the ancestors, should come on to this place which has been prepared for them and smeared around" (thus presumably). 

80.4 The vessels are taken and cleaned (this has been done during the preceding worship; see 19), and their presiding deity, the Sun, is wor- shipped in them by means of his five names or "manifestation formulas" (*mürtimantra*): Aditya, Bhaskara, Sürya, Märtända, and Vivasvăn. The vessels are heated by means of ghee with* devasya tvā *and put down on the besmeared site. 

ॐ आदित्यं आवाहयामि । ॐ भास्करं आवाहयामि । ॐ सूर्यं आवाहयामि । ॐ मार्ताण्डं आवाहयामि ।	 ॐ विवस्वन्तं आवाहयामि ।

 ॐ आदित्यं प्रपद्ये । ॐ भास्करं प्रपद्ये । ॐ सूर्यं प्रपद्ये । ॐ मार्ताण्डं प्रपद्ये । ॐ विवस्वतं प्रपद्ये ॥

*oṃ ādityaṃ āvāhayāmi । oṃ bhāskaraṃ āvāhayāmi । oṃ sūryaṃ āvāhayāmi । oṃ mārtāṇḍaṃ āvāhayāmi । oṃ vivasvantaṃ āvāhayāmi ।*

* oṃ ādityaṃ prapadye । oṃ bhāskaraṃ prapadye । oṃ sūryaṃ prapadye । oṃ mārtāṇḍaṃ prapadye । oṃ vivasvataṃ prapadye ॥*

80.5 The *havis *is put into the vessels, but a quarter of it may be left in the *sthalī *or cooking-pot. It may be given to the attendants or used as a *bali *(A). The formula used is *amṛtopastaraṇam asi* "you are the sub- stratum for nectar" (in the Veda used for the sipping of water before taking food). 

॥ अमृतमस्तु । अमृतोपस्तरणमसि ॥

80.6 Spices, fruits, desserts, molasses etc. are added with the gayatri: tat savitur etc. Only BP says: with the* Viṣṇugāyatri: nārāyaṇāya vidmahe* etc.

ॐ ना॒रा॒य॒णाय॑ वि॒द्महे॑ वासु॒देवाय॑ धीमहि । तन्नो॑ विष्णु: प्रचो॒दया᳚त् ॥

80.7 The havis is touched and the *annasūkta *"Hymn to the Food"[^88] [^89] is recited. According to BP, the *surabhimudrā *is shown.

     Check Appendix-V

80.8 Clarified butter is added, preferably from a red cow (BKh), and mixed with fruits and curds (A). The formula used is: *yat te sušime hṛdayam divi candramasi sthitam / tasyāmṛtatvasyeśāno maham pautra- makham rudam*[^90] " Oh You with the hair well-parted, the immortal nature which is in Your heart, in heaven and in the moon, may I be ruler over it in order that I need not deplore the (missing) sacrifice of my grandsons."

[^90]:
     Given completely by KAV in this place. Cf. the Vedic Concordance, p. 739. 

 80.9 A flower is laid on the *havis *after the ghee has been poured upon it (BKh, BY, BP). BP: the formula of eight syllables (*Om namo narayaṇāya*) is said. 

80.10 The vessel(s) is (are) sprinkled with pure water. This is accompanied by the syllable *om*. 

80.11 At last the *havis *is offered to Visņu with two formulas: at first,* tad asya priyam abhi patho aśyam nara yatra devayavo madanti / uru-kramasya sa hi bandhur ittha vişnoh pade parame madhva utsah*[^91] "may I attain that beloved protectorate of His, where the men who strive for the God are exulting; for that is truly the source of honey, the companion of the broad-striding Vişņu in His highest step". The second formula is: *subhūs svayambhūḥ prathamam antar mahaty arṇave dadhe ha garbham tviyam yato jātah prajāpatik* "the well-born One, the spontaneously- born One, as the first in the great (primeval) flood, placed the embryo in proper time, from whence Prajapati has been born".[^92]" It is difficult to see what is the connection of the last formula with the act in question. Very probably, the subhūs svayambhūḥ of the mantra has been identified with Vişņu-Nārāyaṇa, who is said to be in a lying position above the waters (thus the traditional etymology of the name Nārāyaṇa).[^93] 

[^91]:
     AV. 1,154,5; TBr. 2,4,6,2; etc. Curiously enough, KAV gives the formula in its Rgvedic reading and not in that of the TBr. 

[^92]:
     VS. 23,63; KAV on KA 6; etc. BP: this formula is recited when a cake (apupa) is offered. Nothing about the composition of this cake is prescribed. 

[^93]:
     Thus AN, p. 11; the etymology is known also to the Purāṇas. Cf. also J. Gonda, Aspects of early Visnuism (Utrecht, 1954), p. 15.

    तद॑स्य प्रि॒य म॒भि पाथो॑ अश्याम्॒ नरो॒ यत्र॑ देव॒ यवो॒ मद॑न्ति ।

*tádasya priyámabhí pā́tho aśyām náro yátra devayávo mádanti ǀ*

*urukramásya sá hí bándhuritthā́ víṣṇoḥ padé paramé mádhva útsaḥ ǁ 5 ॥*

80.12 Havis is given also to the Four Manifestations: rice boiled in milk (*payasa*) to Purușa, with *hiraṇyagarbhah*; a mixture of rice and sesamum (*kṛśara*; *tilaudana*, BK) to Satya, with* iha puştim*; a mixture of rice and molasses etc. (*gaulya*) to Acyuta, with *samāvavarti*; and a barley- dish (*yāvaka*) to Aniruddha with* tat trīṇy eșa*.[^94] Havis may also be given to the minor images of Vişņu, to the two goddesses, Brahmā and Īśa, the two seers, etc. 

[^94]:
      About the exact composition of these mixtures, K gives some information in ch. 75. The formulas mentioned are resp. RV. 10,121,1 (VMP 6,13); VSK 8,2,5a (VMP 8,34 pratikena); TBr. 2, 6,6,5 (VMP 8,34 pratikena); and VMP 6,34. Instead of the last one, K. prescribes trīņi padā (VMP 6,1,3), and VMP mentions kayā naś citrā (RV. 4,31,1; see el. 66.1).

80.13 BP now mentions a few actions like presentation of water for rinsing the mouth, a handful of flowers, betel. 

#### 81 OBLATIONS ARE MADE INTO THE FIRE (homa). 

A calls this element *mūrtihoma*, KA: *nityahoma*. In the strict sense, this fire offering is an interruption in the regular *pūjā *pattern. It is of quite another nature and originates in the Vedic system of worship. Yet it has been retained in nearly all pūjā ceremonies of a certain size, even in Śāktism and Tantrism. —-The *homa *is performed in a small sacrificial hall (*yagaśālā*) to the south of the temple. The firepit is of the type called *aupasana *or *sabhyā*. The oblation consists of a porridge (*caru*) with clarified butter mixed with it. The details of the ceremony are to be carried out according to the description in* Vaikhānasa gṛhya Sūtra *1,9 ff. Some of these details are found in KA and KAV. Of all the handbooks, BKh gives a few more particulars than the others. BY refers expressly to BKh for more information. — In this survey, the full details of the fire-offering cannot be discussed. Suffice it to say, that oblations are brought to a number of deities and to Viṣṇu last. The oblations to Viṣṇu are accompanied by the litany* ato devā *etc. and by the Lord's manifestation formulas. The attendant deities should not be forgotten (K: *homa *should be directed to all deities residing in the temple).

81.1 When the oblations have been completed, A adds yet a prescription: the officiant should once again sprinkle around the fire and worship it. In one manuscript of A this is stated with more precision: he should worship the sun, and then the fire, saying the *Vaiśvānarasūkta*. BKh: worship fire and sun. This is all that is to be found in the handbooks, and thus the contents of the "worship of the sun" remain somewhat mysterious.[^95]

[^95]:
     KAV gives a rule that the sun should be worshipped with the formula ad wayam (RV. 1,50,10; etc.).

81.2 After *homa*, the fire should be caused to enter again into the firewood and laid upon a non-sacred fire (*laukikāgni*), presumably the temple kitchen (M). BK: if possible, keep the fire burning. Thus also BP, who adds: "if this is impossible, cause the fire to ascend into the firewood or into yourself". The ash may be used to make a Viṣṇuite mark on the forehead (KA).

81.3 A remarkable point is that the *homa *is not found in the worship of Viṣṇu described by V. Thus there has taken place a secondary combination of the *homa *and the *pūjā *into one ritual of worship. It should be noted however that in other early descriptions of *pūjā *the worship of the deity in the *pūjā *method is sometimes found included within a *homa*, and thus is, so to speak, only a variety of a regular fire offering: at first the fire is prepared in the Vedic way, then the ceremonies of the pūjā are performed and at last the fire offering is completed.[^96]

[^96]:
     Thus e.g. in the Baudhāyane Parisisțasūtra, 3,7f.; cf. Harting, op. cit. (see Intro- duction, n. 4), p. XVIII. 

#### 82 A TRIBUTE (bali) IS BROUGHT TO THE MINOR DEITIES. 

This is the element which is often called *nityotsava *(daily festival). BP and KA call it *yātrāsana*- "procession seat". It is mentioned by all handbooks (not by V), but the most extensive discussions are found in BP and KA. K, however, dedicates a special chapter (ch. 71) to the matter. In the main, the course of this attendance is as follows: the officiating priest (BKh: the *guru*) and one or more assistants go with the tribute around the temple and then to the pedestal where the *balī *is to be laid down. The priest himself carries water, the assistant(s) the *bali *(the assistant bearing the bali is to symbolize Garuda, cf. K, ch. 71). The elements of the *bali *offering are these (BKh, M); water, flowers, perfumes, incense, lamp, balī, water. Or, in an easier variety: water, flowers, balī, water. The assistants acquit themselves of this task. 

82.1 The *balī *is given to all the deities residing in the temple, or to some of them, in accordance with the means available. The remaining part of the bali is laid on the pedestal of the demons. 

82.2 The *bali *to Vişņu will be offered presently (87). BP and KA describe the *yātrāsana *as one whole, which is a systematization of the rather vague treatment of the handbooks. 

82.3 The priest now washes his feet, rinses his mouth, and again enters the temple. 

#### 83 DRINKING-WATER IS OFFERED TO VIŞNU. 

Prescribed by all including V. The formula said is* idam vişnur... *[^97]

[^97]:
     Verse 2 of * ato devā* etc. (so 7).

#### 84 THE FOOD OFFERED IS TAKEN AWAY AND THE SITE AND PEDESTAL ARE CLEANED. 

This is of course the duty of an assistant. No formula is required. 

#### 85 WATER FOR RINSING THE MOUTH IS OFFERED TO VIŞŅU (4). 

Also V mentions this element. The handbooks give no formula. Only KA prescribes *yoge yoge, *for which see 61.1.

#### 86 MOUTH-PERFUME OFFERED TO VISŅU. 

This element is also mentioned by V. The ingredients used for mouth-perfume are mainly cardamon, betel, clove and camphor. BY: these ingredients should be wrapped in a piece of cloth beforehand and kept for a night. About the formula to be used the instructions are divided. V, A, M, KA and BK give vicakrame; A, K, BKh, BY give *ghṛtāt pari. *[^98]

[^98]:
     Resp. RV. 7,100,4 (TBr. 2,4,3,5); Vaikhānasa Gṛhyasūtra 1,7 (see 79.8). 

#### 87 THE balī IS OFFERED TO VIṢŅU. 

With the tribute for Viṣṇu also a circumambulation is made around the temple. If the worship is organized on a larger scale, a special bali image destined for the purpose joins the procession. BP says that the balī image should be adorned, put on a cart with the formula *rathāntaram *(which one?), and honoured with royal insignia. Once again we emphasize that the ceremonies of 82 and 87 are treated as one whole in the younger sources. 

87.1 K, in ch. 71, gives further information about the details of the ceremony and its symbolism. The balī is to be shaped like a lotus and Viṣṇu should be considered as present in it. Brahmā is the presiding deity of the cooked food of which the tribute consists. The assistant who bears the tribute is Garuḍa. The description by K, however detailed, makes no mention of the bali image and thus the conclusion lies to hand that it was not yet known to K. In 0.2.1, it has been seen that of the handbooks BK only mentioned it expressly while summing up the images. 

#### 88 A BOW IS MADE IN FRONT OF THE IMAGE. 

This bow should be done in five varieties, explained by K in ch. 73. The bow should be accompanied by the *viṣṇusūkta: viṣṇor nu kam* etc.[^99] A prescribes* ato devā* etc. 

[^99]:
     RV. 1,154. 

#### 89 THE SACRIFICIAL GIFT (*dakṣiṇā*) IS MADE. 

The handbooks do not fail to mention this element here, but are all rather vague about its exact nature. The *dakṣiṇā *usually consists of gold, jewels, or mouth-perfume (K, M). It is probably due to the officiating priest and should he given by the person on whose behalf and by whose sponsorship the worship in question is performed. 

90 VIṢŅU IS TO BE PRAISED. 

V, the oldest source, says here that the officiant should meditate on God as the personal manifestation of the sacrifice (none of the younger sources repeat or paraphrase this remark) and praise Him with the *puruṣasūkta*.[^100] The *puruṣasūkta *is mentioned unanimously also by the others as a hymn of praise. A, BKh, BP and KA also mention the *viṣṇusūkta*[^101]* *and M and BP the litany *ekākṣara*[^102]* *etc. (VMP 8,38). BKh also mentions* ato devā* etc. (VMP 6,1). VMP mentions the *viṣṇusūkta *and the *puruṣasūkta*, both *pratikena*. BP in addition makes mention of the *viṣṇugāyatrī*, the three *vyāpakamantrah *(which?), and "other mantras and sūktas directed to Viṣṇu". 

[^100]:
     RV. 10,90.

[^101]:
     See note 91. 

[^102]:
     See Appendix III Ekakshara suktam

90.1 KA: now the priest should show to God an ornamental lamp, saying *arcata prarcata. *[^103]

[^103]:
     RV. 8,69,8. Not in VMP in this place.

91 A HANDFUL OF FLOWERS (puṣpāñjali) IS OFFERED TO THE IMAGE. This last element of worship is found also in V. The worshipper says the formulas of eight and twelve syllables: *om namo nārāyaṇāya* and* om namo bhagavate vāsudevāya*; "Om, honour to Nārāyaṇa"; "Om, honour to the Lord Vāsudeva". According to K. and BK, he might say the* viṣṇu-gāyatrī*. Interesting is, that A and BK mention the words* namo brahmaṇe *"honour to Brahman". 

91.1 VMP is the only source which mentions the following verse said in order to take leave of the God in the evening: *arcitas suṣuṣṭutaś cāp suparṇagaruḍadhvaja / cakrapāṇe mahābāho yatheṣṭam vasa om namaḥ* "Oh great-armed One, Who wields the disc in Your hand, Whose banner contains the eagle Garuḍa, being worshipped and duly praised abide here, enjoying Yourself; *om*, honour." 

92 THE DOOR OF THE TEMPLE IS CLOSED and the morning worship is brought to its end. The closing of the door should be accompanied by the formula *sūryas tvā purastāt pātu *"the Sun should protect You in front" (VMP 8,35). 

92.1 In some sources now follow some directions about special features of the worship at noon and in the evening. Thus in the evening the image should not be bathed (K, BK); removal of *nirmalya *only takes place in the morning (BKh). The most important addition in the evening ritual is the preparation of God's resting-place (*śayanāsanam*). As its details are only given by BP, KA and AN, it will not be considered here. - KAV even adds a description of the *paryaṅkāsanam*, "palanquin". 

92.2 The handbooks indeed mention the rule that after the last worship of the day God should be led again into the immovable image. 

92.3 Some other minor regulations are left out of the present description. 

## RETROSPECT

In conclusion it seems desirable to make a few observations of a more general character about the method of worship described here. 

The first conclusion may be that the temple worship described in the handbooks of Atri, Bhrgu, Kāśyapa and Marici is essentially based on the domestic worship found in the* Vaikhānasagṛhyasūtra*. There are many additions, and in some cases the order of the elements has been changed, but these are for the main part due to the more elaborate character of the worship in the temple and not to fundamental changes in outlook. In the worship proper, the *pūjā *directed to Vişņu (57ff.), the number of attendances has been increased to a total of thirty-two, but one is still able to recognize the original character of this pūjā: the invocation and reception of a divine guest and his entertainment. (For some further observations on the original character of the pūjā, one may be referred to Fausta Nowotny, in* Indo-Iranian Journal*, I, 1957, p. 110f.)

 The conservative character of the Vaikhānasa method of worship can also be observed by considering the evidence of some "negative" features. Thus it was seen in group C (24ff.), that the personal preparation of the priest in which he identifies himself with Visņu in order to do the divine work, is, in the handbooks, of a rather restricted but original nature. The younger commentaries and monographs devote a much greater place to the practices of nyasa, syllable mysticism, etc., in accordance with Pāñcarātra and Śaiva systems.

A second "negative" feature in Vaikhānasa pūjā is the absence of any sign of the manasapūjā (mental worship), also called *antaryāga*- which is emphasized so often by the authorities on *pūjā*, e.g. by the Śrī Vaisnavas (Rangachari, *The* *Śrī Vaishnava Brāhmaṇs*, Madras, 1931, pp. 141 ff.), the Pāñcarātrins (e.g.* Lakṣmī Tantra*, ch. 36), the Śaivas (e.g.* Linga Purāṇa* 2, 23f.), and the Tantrists (e.g. Avalon, Principles of Tantra, pp. 1144ff.). True, the Vaikhānasa *arcaka *should meditate on the deity; and the handbooks of Bhṛgu (BKh and BK) even mention the worship of God in the heart (see 0.1), but this mental worship with attendances etc. just as in actual worship is not emphasized at all by the older Vaikhānasa sources. Of the younger monographs, AN devotes about one page to it (pp. 54f.).

An important difference with the *pūjā *of Tantric character edited and commented upon by F. Nowotny, op. cit., is that God is not thought to come out of the heart of the worshipper and to enter again into it after the worship has ended. The Vaikhānasa authorities only mention the invocation of God's presence out of the immovable image into the movable image (by means of an intermediate stage, see 55), and at the end of the day again the dismissal of the divine presence into the immovable image. There is certainly a connection between this method of invocation and the absence of emphasis on mental worship. 

A very original feature of the Vaikhänasa method is the nature of the formulas used. The number and importance of the mantras taken from the *Yajurveda *and the *Rgveda *is very great with respect to other *püja *systems. The short utterances and syllables (*bijaksara*) so well known from Tantric and other descriptions of *pujä*, are nearly entirely absent (but they have been introduced in great numbers by the younger sources such as KA in group C). But the most remarkable fact is that many of these mantras used by the Vaikhanasas are totally unknown anywhere else. In this survey there are 38 of them, spread over the whole ceremony (esp. in 24ff., 33ff., 38ff., 56ff. and the Appendix) but still many more destined for other uses than daily worship exist. They have been collected by the Vaikhanasas and edited under the name *Vaikhanasamantraprašna *(VMP, see Introduction), together with the Vedic mantras used by them. 

A few words must be said here about the nature of this *Mantraprasna *or *Mantrasamhită*. It consists of eight chapters, the first four of which contain the mantras necessary for domestic worship; there it is nearly completely in accordance with the *Grhyasutra*. The last four chapters, called *daivikacatustayam *in the edition, are meant to accompany temple worship as described by a handbook. The question which handbook cannot be answered by a comparison with the respective descriptions of the daily worship as above. In fact it appears that the VMP sometimes shows an order of mantras which is found in none of the handbooks (40.3), sometimes gives formulas for attendances found at the place in question only in the younger sources (e.g. 36.3, 79.3, 79.9) or even formulas not found in the sources at all (40.3). In the great digressions found in 36 and 79 VMP tends to agree with those sources which have these digressions; they must be characterized as later additions. This all leads to the conclusion that the VMP cannot be considered as old, in any case in its redaction not as old as the oldest handbooks; this notwithstanding the fact that it has been provided throughout with accentuation in the Vedic method. Of course it contains materials of a respectable age, but the redaction of the VMP as known nowadays might be fairly recent. One has also to reckon here with additions made in the various manu scripts (see, e.g., 36.2), a fact which may also have been of some influence in the handbooks themselves, where from time to time verses have been put between brackets by the editors. It is possible that the redaction of the last four chapters of VMP took place much later than that of the first four destined for domestic worship. A thorough investigation of the whole Mantrapraśna will be necessary before a more reliable characterization can be given.

For similar reasons, it is difficult to try to place the handbooks themselves in chronological order: to arrive at reliable data the whole of these handbooks will have to be taken into account. Yet something may be said here with a fair degree of certainty. The texts belonging to the *Bhrgu Samhita* (BKh, BK, BY and BP) will have to be considered as secondary with respect to the other texts (A, K and M). BP instantly gives signs of its lateness by its number of additions and the younger and more systematic character of its treatment. But also BKh and BK show such additions with respect to A, K and M. Thus for example, they give a much more elaborate description of the bathing (36.2ff., 39.1, 40.1 and 2, 43); they add new elements in the pajd (especially BK is very detailed about the royal honours in 79.2ff.). In 47, they conceive the images of some minor deities near the image of Visnu as really present; BK presupposes a special halibera to be used for circumambulations around the temple (0.2.1, 0.3; cf. 87); in 54.1, only BK mentions the deities of the syllable a. BKh presupposes the *matrkanyasa*, *vyapaka *etc. in 40.1.

The signs of BY's lateness are of a different character, but they exist none the less. This text gives an interesting addition about meditation on Vişnu's weapons in 28.1. An argument of a more radical nature is, how ever, that in many places BY shows a striking dependence on the version given by M (e.g., in 40, 44, 68, 73.2). This dependence often even takes the character of similarity in wordings (a fact which of course cannot emerge from this survey which does not cite the sources directly). This similarity is clearly visible notwithstanding the fact that M is written in prose and BY in šlokas.

Because the handbook of Atri is written in slokas, it is possible to make a more precise investigation into the possible similarities between A and the texts ascribed to Bhrgu, which are all in slokas. Such a comparison reveals eloquent facts. BKh, ch. 20, has no less than 82 padas (one fourth ślokas) in common with A, ch. 40; and BK, ch. 9, has 39 pådas in common with A, ch. 40. The identity between BK, ch. 9 and BKh, ch. 20, amounts to 51 pādas. BY and BP, however, show a relatively great degree of individuality with respect to BK, BKh, A and each other. Very often the texts follow the device of changing one word in a pada or śloka (often only a small word like *ca*, *tu*, or a change of indicative into optative etc.; such padas have been treated as identical with each other in the figures given above). 

In all the cases where identity with A exists it is, in my opinion, most probable that A represents the original; in the case of the identity of BK and BKh, the latter might contain the original, because it is sometimes cited by name by BK. The chapter on daily worship can lead to the assumption that A is the oldest of the handbooks (see its treatment of group Ci in a few places K gives the impression of paraphrasing it), but nothing certain can be said after an examination of only this limited subject.

 In general, the Vaikhanasa method of performing devout temple worship in the description of the older handbooks can be characterized as elaborate, yet original and conservative; a real influx of new traditions, together with changes in the system, began in the descriptions of the school of Bhrgu, and continued in the monographs of the other schools (KA, KAV, AN). These new traditions show the influence of the Pan carātra and Śrīvaisnava schools, and of ideas fully developed in a Saiva and Šakta milieu; but at the same time the old traditions were maintained, as is shown by the fact that KA and KAV introduce a few other formulas from the Veda and in the order of the pūjā sometimes again rely on the description found in the Grhyasūtra.

###  Atmasūktam 

The hymn given below in the original and in translation is to be found in 51 of the ritual discussed above. Its function is to enlarge the worshipper's consciousness into cosmic size, so that he may be able to identify himself with the Lord Whom he is going to worship. This is done by identifying the parts of his own body with aspects of Vișnu (vss. 2,3), physical phenomena (vss. 4-7) and Vedic deities (vss. 6-8). Also the role of the Vedic seers is of importance (Kapila in vs. 2, Bhrgu in vs. 6, others in vss. 6 and 9). 

The language is of an archaizing character, sometimes rather obscure. Vaikhānasa formulas often purposely use obscure or archaic expressions, thus enhancing their sacred character. The Vaikhanasas accept this as a feature of the ärșa style used by their seers. The tendency is augmented by the fact that the hymn has been provided in the VMP with accent notation (the whole VMP is written with Vedic accent). The accent is not always correctly placed according to Vedic standards. Thus, in vs. 2, udāna has been left without an accent while syūr has one; in vs. 5, syur has an accent while ye has not. The accents have been omitted below. 

The language itself has taken over some Vedic features (e.g. the sub- junctive asan "they be") but the general impression is that of a post- Vedic poem. This is easily proved by post-Vedic words such as saratam (vs. 4), bhujaga (5) and śrutismrti (7), and further by the mention of some Incarnations of Vişnu. 

The metre is fundamentally trişțubh, but sometimes it is difficult to recognize this, e.g. in vss. 6 and 7. Vs. 6a is apparently a half-śloka. 

The source is in the first place VMP 5,49. The hymn is found also in KAV on KA 3, but in a less correct way and probably taken over directly from VMP.

[1] The Self of the self, the Highest and Inner Self, the Inner Self of the Earth; He, the Primeval Self, is our Inner Self; He envelopes everything, maintains the whole; He, Whose merit reveals itself, is our Chief.

[2] As the outward breath, He is guidance; as the upward breath, He is the Primeval Boar[^104] Who grants boons; and as the circulating breath, He is the concrete accumulation of ascetic power, Kapila, prince of hermits; and our downward breath is Hayasirsa.

[^104]:
     The Primeval Boar is one of the types of the images of the Boar incarnation of Visnu. See c.g. Kάλγαρα Αλώπαλάγμα, ch. 79.

[3] Because He, the Imperishable, devours everything completely, [even] Śrt together with Her vigour, He is my digestive breath. Because He constantly smites the demoniacal power my intelligence is Brahmä, the Protector, the Ruler.[^105]

[^105]:
     It is unclear if Brahma is meant here to be the one who smites the demoniscal power one should think preferably of another Incarnation of Vişnu, such as Nara-simha, gopa išvarað might have to be combined as if the reading were gopelvaras "the Lord of cowherds", ie. Visou-Krsta. A case of an archaizing hiatus?

[4] And my heroism is Savitar, the ingredients [of my body) in liquid state, the moon; the [live] elements [constitute] the living beings, the demons included;

my head should be the sky, my belly the intermediate space; my feet have grown [to a size] like the earth; I am the Ruler.

 [5] And further, my bones should be called the mountains, and my hairs are the serpents who live in heaven; the two who have the form of the eyes are the foremost of Pṛthu and Prāņi (?); my blood is the liquid element: the complete quantity of water. 

[6] Let the rivers be my sinews; my heart should be Bhṛgu; all the other hermits should be my limbs; my mouth is formed by the Vedas, Sarasvatī is my tongue; the Maruts are my teeth and oracular revelation is my epiglottis.

[7] Mitra and Varuṇa are my testicles, Prajāpati my sexual organ; the Vedas my entrails, my... are Revelation and Tradition; the rain is my sweat, the ocean is my bladder, the gold is my faeces. 

[8] The Gāyatrī verse called Sāvitrī is the boundary, the sacrificial ground (?); He (Viṣṇu) has entered into the pure lotus of my heart, in His divisible aspect, accompanied by Lakṣmī, with His body full of splendour; everything that is meritorious in me should be His foundation. [^106]

[^106]:
     The word adhiṣṭhāna means also "basement of a temple". The heart functions here as the temple for Viṣṇu.

[9] May I be the Self of all the gods, of all the hermits, the concretization of ascetical power and merit in this world.
