title = "+07 Worship of Vişņu"
+++

The daily worship of Vişņu is performed, according to the handbooks, in the form of a *puja *ceremony of thirty-two attendances, during which Vişņu is received and honoured as a royal guest, together with a homa or fire offering (81) and a bali or tribute (82). It is present in its elementary form already in V. Of the handbooks, BKh and especially BK add a number of new elements. The number is further increased in the later monographs such as KA and BP. Another characteristic of these works is that they sometimes also modify the sequence of the elements and thus have abandoned the structure of the *pūjā *system as described in the handbooks. Instead, they divide the *pūjā *into a number of *āsanas *(seats), on which the God is entertained at different places and in different ways. Thus, KA knows the *mantrasana, snānāsana, alamkārāsana, bhojyāsana, homa, yātrāsana*, while KAV adds the *paryankāsana *at the end. In some places, KA has restored the order of elements as found in V, which had been departed from in the handbooks. Each action is performed at the end of or during the mantra said for it. During each attendance a bell should be rung (A, BK), otherwise the demons take the merit of the *pūjā *(BK). AN specifies four kinds of attendances: the object presented may be visible, touchable, audible or edible. These are specified further.
