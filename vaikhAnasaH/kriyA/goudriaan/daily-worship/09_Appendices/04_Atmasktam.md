The hymn given below in the original and in translation is to be found in 51 of the ritual discussed above. Its function is to enlarge the worshipper's consciousness into cosmic size, so that he may be able to identify himself with the Lord Whom he is going to worship. This is done by identifying the parts of his own body with aspects of Vișnu (vss. 2,3), physical phenomena (vss. 4-7) and Vedic deities (vss. 6-8). Also the role of the Vedic seers is of importance (Kapila in vs. 2, Bhrgu in vs. 6, others in vss. 6 and 9). 

The language is of an archaizing character, sometimes rather obscure. Vaikhānasa formulas often purposely use obscure or archaic expressions, thus enhancing their sacred character. The Vaikhanasas accept this as a feature of the ärșa style used by their seers. The tendency is augmented by the fact that the hymn has been provided in the VMP with accent notation (the whole VMP is written with Vedic accent). The accent is not always correctly placed according to Vedic standards. Thus, in vs. 2, udāna has been left without an accent while syūr has one; in vs. 5, syur has an accent while ye has not. The accents have been omitted below. 

The language itself has taken over some Vedic features (e.g. the sub- junctive asan "they be") but the general impression is that of a post- Vedic poem. This is easily proved by post-Vedic words such as saratam (vs. 4), bhujaga (5) and śrutismrti (7), and further by the mention of some Incarnations of Vişnu. 

The metre is fundamentally trişțubh, but sometimes it is difficult to recognize this, e.g. in vss. 6 and 7. Vs. 6a is apparently a half-śloka. 

The source is in the first place VMP 5,49. The hymn is found also in KAV on KA 3, but in a less correct way and probably taken over directly from VMP.

[1] The Self of the self, the Highest and Inner Self, the Inner Self of the Earth; He, the Primeval Self, is our Inner Self; He envelopes everything, maintains the whole; He, Whose merit reveals itself, is our Chief.

[2] As the outward breath, He is guidance; as the upward breath, He is the Primeval Boar[^104] Who grants boons; and as the circulating breath, He is the concrete accumulation of ascetic power, Kapila, prince of hermits; and our downward breath is Hayasirsa.

[^104]:
     The Primeval Boar is one of the types of the images of the Boar incarnation of Visnu. See c.g. Kάλγαρα Αλώπαλάγμα, ch. 79.

[3] Because He, the Imperishable, devours everything completely, [even] Śrt together with Her vigour, He is my digestive breath. Because He constantly smites the demoniacal power my intelligence is Brahmä, the Protector, the Ruler.[^105]

[^105]:
     It is unclear if Brahma is meant here to be the one who smites the demoniscal power one should think preferably of another Incarnation of Vişnu, such as Nara-simha, gopa išvarað might have to be combined as if the reading were gopelvaras "the Lord of cowherds", ie. Visou-Krsta. A case of an archaizing hiatus?

[4] And my heroism is Savitar, the ingredients [of my body) in liquid state, the moon; the [live] elements [constitute] the living beings, the demons included;

my head should be the sky, my belly the intermediate space; my feet have grown [to a size] like the earth; I am the Ruler.

 [5] And further, my bones should be called the mountains, and my hairs are the serpents who live in heaven; the two who have the form of the eyes are the foremost of Pṛthu and Prāņi (?); my blood is the liquid element: the complete quantity of water. 

[6] Let the rivers be my sinews; my heart should be Bhṛgu; all the other hermits should be my limbs; my mouth is formed by the Vedas, Sarasvatī is my tongue; the Maruts are my teeth and oracular revelation is my epiglottis.

[7] Mitra and Varuṇa are my testicles, Prajāpati my sexual organ; the Vedas my entrails, my... are Revelation and Tradition; the rain is my sweat, the ocean is my bladder, the gold is my faeces. 

[8] The Gāyatrī verse called Sāvitrī is the boundary, the sacrificial ground (?); He (Viṣṇu) has entered into the pure lotus of my heart, in His divisible aspect, accompanied by Lakṣmī, with His body full of splendour; everything that is meritorious in me should be His foundation. [^106]

[^106]:
     The word adhiṣṭhāna means also "basement of a temple". The heart functions here as the temple for Viṣṇu.

[9] May I be the Self of all the gods, of all the hermits, the concretization of ascetical power and merit in this world.
