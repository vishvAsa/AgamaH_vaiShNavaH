There is an outer perimeter , which has a silver lined doorway leading to the inner part of the temple ( Vendi Vakili or silver corridor) . 

This leads to the inner temple, which is gilded over by gold ( Bangaru vimanam). The inner temple has a courtyard called Tirumaamani mandapam, or Mahamani mandapam, which is gilded all over by gold plates. This courtyard has Garudalwar, and the 2 dwarapalakas ( Jaya and Vijaya ) , and the Main bell, and Hundi of the temple. 

Beyond this courtyard are 3 rooms, after which room number 4 is the main Garbhalayam .

Cameras are NOT allowed beyond the silver threshold in the temple. All the video footage we see, is of events which occur outside the silver threshold only. Any photos beyond it are either old ones or secretly captured and restricted.
