title = "Not shiva"
+++

As far as i know , based on every book i have read, and what i saw with my own eyes a few months ago , from just outside the Kulasekhara paDi ( the last threshold) , i can say these things.


## NO NAGABHARANAS
There ARE NO NAGABHARANAS etched on the murthy. There are armlets, which have vertical spires , called saptaagni shikha on the arms .   
(The nagabharaNas commonly seen are merely external ornaments.)

These are clearly visible on a Thursday darshanam, when the gold ornaments are removed and the original shila svarupam can be seen.

## jaTA
(Based on what i have been told) he has beautiful locks of hair, till his shoulders . this is not any different from any other Vishnu murthy.  the confusion among people comes from similar sounding words. JATA JUTA and JATA MAKUTA.

- jata juta is matted hair locks.
- but JATA MAKUTA is a matted hair crown . 

the lord does NOT have a jata makuta,  
but a ATI-Uttama KIREETA MAKUTA, or a regal crown , for an Emperor.  
His crown is called a Venu Karanabha crown ( or a tall conical bamboo shoot like crown).

## vaikhAnasa archanA
The archakas, of 4 families have serving him for 1900 years , as far as we know.  even today,  the hereditary archakas are still serving him.   

If he is Lord shiva, why would they worship him with vaikhanasa methods ?

## Ancient references
This is from Silappadhikaram, one of the most ancient Tamil Sangam literature works . the writer was a Jain - ILango Adigal . a clear vivid description of the deity atop the Vemgadam hill is given in it . see below

Silappadhikaram,  Book XI, lines 41 to 51:- 

> "High on Vengadam's towering crest,   
with flowing streams in flood,   
Betwixt the effulgent glory, of shining Sun and Moon,  
Like unto a blue cloud in lightning dres’st  
In all the brilliance of rainbow dight,   
The Red-eyed great One, majestic stands  
In dress of flowery brilliance with garland bright,  
One lotus hand with fearsome disc adorned,  
and milk white conch (the other held)."
