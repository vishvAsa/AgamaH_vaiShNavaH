## Overview
There are 6 books primarily written on the temple, published by TTD. 

- 3 books have false information due to the authors being biased towards smartha /shaiva sects 
- 3 are vaishnava aligned. 
  - of them , 1 is written by a disciple of kanchi kamakoti peetham, but he strongly disavows the shaiva viewpoint. He is Dr N Ramesan. Dr N ramesan, was a phd in archeology, and also an IAS. He was the executive officer of TTD, and later the chairman of TTD.  Even though it's not the best book info wise, it is important because of him adhering to the truth and not succumbing to his matham’s theology. 
  - 1 is by a sri vaishnava, so vaishnava aligned .(TKT Veeraraghavacharya )
  - 1 is by a madhva , but its considered the most authofitative book , above all.  (Prof SKR rao)

Sadly, people who have intimate knowledge if the temple, have written false information.


## Fakers
Sri Sadhu subramanya Shastry, was the epigraphist of the temple, and worked on recording every stone inscription in the temple. He started the modern day rumors of “shiva” in the temple by his book.
