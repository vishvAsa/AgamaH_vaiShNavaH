From temple to transcendence: The Philosophical Foundations of Moksha in Vaikhānasa Tradition

**Ramakrishna Ganjam**

## Abstract
This article presents a detailed exploration of the doctrine of mokṣa (liberation) as propounded in the Vaikhānasa tradition, drawing extensively from the Vaikhānasa Kalpasūtra, the Ānanda Samhitā, and authoritative Upaniṣadic sources. It emphasizes the dual understanding of the Supreme Being as both *saguṇa* (with attributes) and *nirguṇa* (without attributes), illustrating how meditation on the personal form of Viṣṇu (*saguṇa* brahman) leads to realization of the formless Absolute (*nirguṇa* brahman).

The article further elucidates how daily *vigraha* (idol) worship—both in homes and temples—is not merely ritualistic but grounded in the Vedic *yajña* system and enriched by profound philosophical insight. 

The role of the *arcaka* (priest) Is redefined not only as a ritual performer but as a teacher who guides devotees in understanding the deeper principles of Viṣṇu devotion, *karma, ātma*, and *prakṛti*. 

By interpreting scriptural passages from sages such as Kaśyapa and Marīci, the study highlights that the path to liberation in the Vaikhānasa system is universal in scope, intellectually robust, and spiritually inclusive— providing a living bridge between Vedic wisdom and contemporary religious practice.

## Introduction
The ultimate aim of all Vedic disciplines is to lead human beings toward a life filled with bliss (*ānandamaya jīvana*). By articulating the fourfold goals of life—Dharma, Artha, Kāma, and Mokṣa—the Vedic wisdom offers a meaningful framework for human existence and gradually guides the seeker toward eternal bliss (*śāśvata ānanda-svarūpa*).

Though infinitesimal in the vast cosmic expanse, humanity is uniquely endowed with the intellectual capacity to comprehend the fundamental rhythms of the universe and to respond meaningfully to them. Those initiated into the path of Vedic learning would hardly deny that the contemplative and meditative practices outlined in the Upaniṣads have enabled humanity to understand the deeper truths of existence.

With the expansion of human societies and the influence of diverse historical and cultural contexts, various paths toward liberation (mokṣa) have emerged. Yet, upon closer reflection, one finds a striking unity underlying these paths. The aspiration for a blissful and liberated life has given rise to a multitude of philosophical reflections and doctrinal interpretations.

Diverse modes of living, forms of worship, and doctrinal traditions emerged throughout India. However, only those traditions grounded in sound philosophy, logical coherence, a harmonious relationship with nature, and compassion toward fellow beings have flourished on this sacred land. Among them, the Vaikhānasa tradition stands as a sublime and enduring spiritual path.

## The Vaikhānasa Tradition and Its Geographical Spread
The Vaikhānasa *Sampradāya* represents a devout community that adheres to the *Kalpasūtra* composed by the sage Vikhanasa. This tradition practices the life-cycle rituals (*saṁskāras*) beginning with *niṣeka* in accordance with the prescriptions of the *sūtra*, and upholds a *dhārmic* mode of life centered around the worship of Lord Viṣṇu as the Supreme Deity (*Parama Daiva*). Both at home and in temples, Vaikhānasa adherents engage in the ritualistic worship [[P243]] (ārādhana) of the *divya-maṅgala vigraha*—the auspicious, sacral image of Viṣṇu—regarding it as the direct embodiment of the divine.

The philosophical foundation of the tradition is rooted in *Lakṣmī-viśiṣṭādvaita siddhānta*, and its ultimate goal is the attainment of *mokṣa* (liberation). The originator of this tradition is revered as Śrī Vikhanasa Mahāmuni, who is believed by followers to be a divine emanation (*aṁśa*) of Viṣṇu Himself. His four eminent disciples—Bhrgu, Marīci, Atri, and Kaśyapa—are honoured as great sages who disseminated the teachings of Vikhanasa to the world.

Built upon the foundational truths of the Vedas and the Upaniṣads, and upheld through rational philosophical inquiry, the Vaikhānasa tradition stands as a highly evolved and spiritually profound system of thought and practice. It is widely acknowledged in the southern regions of India—Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, and Kerala—where numerous Vaikhānasa priests, motivated by the noble intent of universal welfare (*loka-kṣema*), continue to perform the sacred rituals of Viṣṇu worship in temples dedicated to Him.

## Vaikhānasa Perspective on Liberation (Mokṣa) and Scriptural Foundations

In this article, I intend to elaborate on the concept of *mokṣa* as expounded in the Vaikhānasa scriptures. Drawing from the contemplative methodologies prescribed in the Upaniṣads—particularly in the *Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad*—the Vaikhānasa tradition has formulated a coherent and spiritually elevating path to liberation.

### Upaniṣads
The following *mantras* from the Upaniṣads are foundational to the Vaikhānasa understanding of *mokṣa*, and their interpretive meanings form the doctrinal base of this tradition:

> यतो वीरः कर्मणि  
> सुदक्षो युक्तग्राव जायते देवकामः । 1 [^244_1]

> The Supreme Being, who is valorous and skillful in blessing His devotees, incarnates joyfully in a suitable stone form as part of His divine sport.

[^244_1]: Uttamabramha vidya sara, 2 adhikara.

> अजायमानो बहुधा विजायते ।2 [^244_2]

> Though unborn, He manifests in many diverse forms.

[^244_2]: Purusasuktham

> अग्निर्वै देवानाम् अवमः विष्णुः परमः।

> Among the deities, Agni is considered the lowest, while Viṣṇu is the highest.

> उपासते पुरुषं ये ह्य् आकामास्  
> ते शुक्रम् एतद् अतिवर्तन्ति धीराः।

> Those who worship the Supreme Person without desires transcend birth and attain immortality.

> तस्मादात्मस्थमरचयेत् भूतिकामः।

> If you desire the wealth called *mokṣa*, then you should worship the one who resides within your own self.

> हृदा मनीषा मनसा अभिक्लृप्तो  
> य एष आत्मा विदुः अमृतास्ते भवन्ति।

> One who realizes that the worship of the sacred form of Viṣṇu is the essence of the teachings of the Śruti, Smṛti, and the Vaikhānasa tradition becomes immortal.

> आत्मक्रीडा आत्मरतिः क्रियावान् एष ब्रह्मविदां वरिष्ठः। [^244_3]

[^244_3]: Muṇḍakopaniṣat, 3, 1.

> One who has internal devotion to the Supreme Being and externally offers loving worship to His *divya maṅgala vigraha* (idol) becomes the most exalted among the knowers of Brahman.


These Upaniṣadic revelations collectively reflect the universal vision of *mokṣa* offered by the Vaikhānasa tradition. The structure of temple worship is conceived as an extension of the *yajñic* framework prescribed in the Vedas.

In this context, Sage Atri declares

> “अतः परं प्रवक्ष्यामि  
> प्रतिष्ठाविधिमुत्तमम्।  
> देवार्चनं द्विधा प्रोक्तं  
> अमूर्तञ्च समूर्तकम्।  
> अमूर्तं गार्हपत्यादि  
> सर्वाग्निषु हुतं स्मृतम्।  
> तस्याधानादिकं सर्वं  
> सूत्रे विखनसोदितम्।  
> तत्सूत्रोक्तविधानेन  
> सर्वमाघारपूर्वकम्।  
> अस्मिन्कर्मणि तच्छिष्टं  
> होमकर्म समाचरेत्।  
> 
> समूर्तमालये बिम्बे  
> नित्यं विधिवदर्चनम्।  
> अग्न्याधानं प्रतिष्ठा स्याद्  
> इष्टिः पर्वार्चनादिका।  
> यागश् चावभृथान्तस् स्याद्  
> उत्सवस् तद्विधानतः।  
> विष्णोरेतत् समूर्तं यः  
> पूजनं भक्तितश्चरेत्।  
> अतीन्द्रियं स गच्छेत् तद्  
> अक्षयं परमं पदम्॥“4 [^244_4]

These verses clearly classify the worship of the Supreme Being into two modes: *Amūrta* (formless), referring to sacrificial offerings in fire such as *gārhapatya*, and *Samūrta* (with form), denoting the ritual worship of the *vigraha* (idol) of the deity in a temple. Among the two, *samūrtārcanā—vigraha* (idol) worship—is regarded as superior.

[^244_4]: Samūrtārcanādhikaraņam, Adhyāya 27.

The *pratiṣṭhā* (installation) of the deity in temples is equated with *agnyādheya*, the first of the Vedic *śrauta yajñas*. The five sacred fires (*pañcāgni*) of Vedic rituals correspond to the five *bherīs* in temples; *iṣṭis* are represented as *parvārchanās*; *yāgas* as *utsavas*; and the *avabhṛtha* (ritual bath) of *yajñas* in the concluding celebrations of temple festivals.

Thus, Sage Atri illuminates the idea that temple worship, as outlined in the Vaikhānasa scriptures, is not a deviation from Vedic sacrifice but its legitimate and spiritually potent counterpart, established upon scriptural foundations.

Moreover, unlike Vedic *yagnas* which are restricted to specific patrons (*yajamānas*), the system of worship proposed by the Vaikhānasa sages aims at universal welfare (*loka-kṣema*), offering the fruits of *mokṣa* to all sincere devotees. That such a gracious doctrine could have emerged only through the blessings of the great sages is beyond dispute.

## On the Formless and Form-Based Worship in the Vaikhānasa Tradition
For followers of this *śāstra*, the primary duty lies in meditating upon the formless reality of the Supreme Being, invoking Him into a form, and performing daily *ārādhanā* (worship) through the *vigraha* (idol). This is not merely ritualistic action but an act rooted in deep spiritual understanding and devotional commitment.
[[P244]]

> "अथ विष्णोर्देवेशस्य  
> प्रतिष्ठाविधिं व्याख्यास्ये ।  
> सोऽव्ययः सर्वव्याप्य आकाशोपमः,  
> निष्कलः, परमात्मा  
> ज्ञानेन भक्त्या च युक्तस्य अन्तः सन्निहितो भवति।  
> 
> "आत्मा गुहायां निहितोऽस्य जन्तोः" इति श्रुतिः।  
> तस्माद् भक्तिमता तेन  
> सकलं संकल्प्य  
> भक्त्या मन्त्रैश्च प्रतिष्ठापिते बिम्बे  
> भक्तानुकम्पया सकलः तद्बिम्बे समाविष्टः  
> देवः प्रतिष्ठितो भवेत्। 
> 
> अव्यक्तं शाश्वतम् अनादिमध्यान्तम् अतीन्द्रियं  
> देवैर् अप्य् अनभिलक्ष्यं यद् वैष्णवं पदं  
> तत्र प्राप्ति-फलं तद्-अर्चनं,  
> तस्य मूलं प्रतिष्ठा । “5 [^245_5]

In these profound statements, Sage Kaśyapa compares the Supreme Reality to space—unbounded, formless, eternal. This *Paramātma*, though devoid of form (*niṣkala*), becomes accessible through the integrated path of *jñāna* (knowledge) and *bhakti* (devotion). 

Through meditative visualization and Vedic *mantras*, the Lord becomes established in the *vigraha* (idol), allowing devotees to engage in tangible worship. 

Hence, the Vaikhānasa *śāstra* does not limit the notion of *brahma* to the icon of Viṣṇu with four arms, conch, and discus alone. It emphasizes that the Supreme Being encompasses both *niṣkala* (formless) and *sakala* (with form) aspects.

[^245_5]: Kaśyapa Jñānakāņda, Adhyāya 29.

This dual nature is further illustrated in the Vimānārcana Kalpa of Sage Marīci

> “तस्य भावस् तत्त्वम् इति  
> तस्य पर-ब्रह्मणः परमात्मनो नारायणस्य भावः  
> 'तत्त्वं नारायणः पर' इति श्रुतिः।  
> तद्-अवगमनं ज्ञानं तद्-विदः ब्रह्म-विदः।  
> तस्मात् "परमात्मा ज्ञेयः, जीवात्मा ज्ञाता, श्रुतयो ज्ञानम्"  
> इति ब्रह्मवादिनो वदन्ति।  
> 
> तद् ब्रह्मणो निष्कलस् सकलश् च स्वभावः।  
> निष्कल-परमात्मनो ऽन्यन् न किञ्चिद् अस्तीति  
> क्षीरे सर्पिः, तिले तैलं, पुष्पे गन्धः, फले रसः, काष्ठे अग्निर् इव  
> अन्तर् बहिश् च तत् सर्वं व्याप्य +आकाशोपमः  
> 
> > 'अन्तर् बहिश् च तत् सर्वं  
> व्याप्य नारायणस् स्थितः' 
> 
> इति 
> 
> > 'आकाश-शरीरं ब्रह्म' 
> 
> इति।  
> अशरीरः शरीरेषु व्याप्य तिष्ठति,  
> 
> > 'अणोर् अणीयान् महतो महीयान्  
> आत्मा गुहायां निहितो ऽस्य जन्तोर्' 
> 
> इति श्रुतिः।  
> तस्माद् हृदय-कमलान्तराकाशोपलब्ध-वैश्वानर-शिखायां  
> त्रिगुणात्मको विष्णुः परमात्मा तिष्ठति।  
> 
> > 'तस्याः शिखाया-मध्ये परमात्मा व्यवस्थितः।  
> स ब्रह्मा स शिव' 
> 
> इति श्रुतिः।  
> एवं निष्कलम् इति विज्ञायते। “

These *śruti*-based declarations expand on the *niṣkala* nature of *Paramātma*, explaining that just as ghee is latent in milk, fragrance in a flower, or fire in wood, the Supreme permeates everything—subtle and gross. Thus, the term "*tattva*" itself is synonymous with Viṣṇu.

> अथ सकलः  
> काष्ठे अग्निर् मथनात् ज्वलन्न् इव  
> निष्कलात्मको विष्णुः  
> ध्यान-मथनेन भक्त्या सङ्कल्पनात् सकलो भवति।  
> तस्माद् अग्नेर् विस्फुलिङ्गा इव  
> ब्रह्मेशानादि-देवतारूपैर् भिन्नत्वात्  
> कुलाल-चक्रस्थ-मृदो घट-शरावादि-भेद(दा) इव  
> यद्-यद्-रूपं मनसा भावितं  
> तत्-तद्-रूपो भूत्वा विष्णुः प्रकाशते। [^245_6]

That said,  
when the all-pervading Viṣṇu principle is churned through meditative concentration (*dhyāna mathana*),  
it reveals itself in perceivable forms.  

> The same formless Viṣṇu thus becomes manifest to the inner eye of the devotee,  
and is installed in the *divya maṅgala vigraha* (idol) made of stone or metal for worship.

[^245_6]: Vimanarchana kalpa, 82 patalaha.

This is the essence of *sākāra ārādhana*—form-based worship. Accordingly, the *āgamic* system asserts that those engaged in worship must possess profound *Vedānta jñāna*, mastery over the disciplines of *aṣṭāṅga yoga*, the ability to hold the *Paramātma* in their mind with unwavering devotion, and a disciplined understanding of Vedic *mantras*.
Hence, performing the duties of a temple priest (*arcaka*) is not merely a task of adorning the *vigraha* (idol). It is the practical application of a deeply contemplative path prescribed in the Upaniṣads—a path that unites knowledge, devotion, and divine service (*kaimkarya*).

## Vaikhānasa View of Mokṣa: Synthesizing Vedic and Āgamic Insights
The concept of the *saguṇa-nirguṇa tattva*—the dual nature of the Supreme as both with and without attributes—is not confined to the temple-centered rituals of the Āgamas alone. It finds a prominent place in the *Kalpasūtra* of the Vaikhānasa tradition, which offers a comprehensive exposition of Vedic life.

### The Vaikhānasa Kalpasūtra states
> "अथाऽग्नौ नित्यहोमान्ते विष्णोर्नित्यार्चा सर्वदेवार्चा भवति। अग्निर्वै देवानामवमः विष्णुः परमः तदन्दरेण सर्वा अन्यादेवताः इति ब्राह्मणम्। तस्मद्गहे परमं विष्णुं प्रतिष्ठाप्य सायं प्रातर्होमान्ते अर्चयति । यज्ञेषु विहीनं तत्सम्पूर्ण भवद्विजातिरतन्द्रितो नित्यं गृहे देवायतने वा भक्त्या भगवन्तं नारायणमर्चयेत्। तद्विष्णोः परमं पदं गच्छतीति विज्ञायते । “7 [^245_7]

These statements clearly affirm that *mokṣa* may be attained by worshipping Viṣṇu daily in the *vigraha* (idol) form installed in one's home, especially after completing daily *yajñas* such as *vaiśvadeva*. This interpretation aligns with the deeper meaning of the Brāhmaṇa portions of the Vedas.
[^245_7]: Vaikhanasa kalpa sutram, 4 prashna.

Even without performing elaborate temple worship, a Vaikhānasa *brāhmaṇa*—by living according to the *Kalpasūtra* and adhering to the principles of *varṇāśrama dharma*—can attain *mokṣa* through regular worship of Viṣṇu at home. For this reason, worship of Viṣṇu is also enjoined even for those in the *sannyāsa āśrama*.

### The Kalpasūtra further declares
> “सगुणे ब्रह्मणि बुद्धिं निवेश्य पश्चान्निर्गुणं ब्रह्माश्रित्य मोक्षे नित्यं यत्नं कुर्यादिति विज्ञायते । "

This verse indicates a structured path to liberation in this very life. According to this principle:
“*सगुणे ब्रह्मणि बुद्धिं निवेश्य*” – The aspirant must first fix the mind on the *saguṇa*, personal form of Brahman—Lord Viṣṇu. One should visualize His auspicious features: the conch and discus, the crown, curly hair, necklace, Kaustubha gem, Śrīvatsa mark, a face radiant like the full moon, lotus-like eyes, yellow garments, and a crystal-pure body. This divine form of Nārāyaṇa should be held firmly in meditative focus.
“*निर्गुणं ब्रह्माश्रित्य*” – Subsequently, the aspirant should ascend from the *saguṇa* form into the contemplation of *nirguṇa* Brahman—the radiant, formless, stainless, infinite, all-pervasive Absolute; accessible through the Omkāra, beyond all qualities, unknowable by ordinary means, and of the nature of supreme bliss.

### The yogin who follows this path can attain mokṣa in this very life
That said, the Vaikhānasa community adopts temple worship (*ālaya-ārādhanā*) not merely for personal liberation but as a collective effort for the upliftment of all devotees.
[[P245]]
The *Ānanda Saṁhitā*, a revered Vaikhānasa text attributed to Sage Marīci, clearly enjoins that all devotees—irrespective of caste—are eligible to receive Viṣṇu *dīkṣā* from a qualified *ācārya*. The compassionate role of the teacher is emphasized as one who rescues the disciple from the ocean of *saṁsāra* and initiates him into the path of *bhakti* and *mokṣa* through the formal ritual of consecration, marked by the imprinting of the Śaṅkha and Cakra on the arms of the disciple. The text declares:

> आचार्यश्शिष्यं आहूय ब्राह्मणं क्षत्रियं तथा । वैश्यं वापि तथा शूद्रं मा भैषीरिति च ब्रुवन्॥
संसारार्णवमग्नं त्वामुद्धरिष्याम्यसंशयः । इत्युक्त्वा श्रीपतिं ध्यान्य नित्यार्चनविधानतः ॥
श्रीपतिं सम्यगभ्यर्च्य जप्त्वा गुरुपरंपराम् । मां रक्षसि यथा स्वामिन् मामकं रक्षसादरम् ॥
एवं श्रियःपतिं प्रार्थ्य शङ्खचक्रे प्रगृह्य वै । मृच्छन्दनादिकैर्लिप्तं कृत्वा तन्मन्त्रमुच्चरन्।
भुजद्वयेऽपि शिष्यस्य सोङ्कयेद्भक्तवत्सलः । अन्तेवासी हरेश्चक्रं धारयामि इति संवदेत्।।
तथैव च हरेः शङ्खं धारयामि समीरयेत् । हरिं सम्यक्समभ्यर्च्य पूर्वोक्तेन विधानतः॥
हरेश्चक्रं हरेः शङ्खं धारयामि विमुक्तये । इत्युक्त्वा सहसोत्थाय गुरूं नत्वाभिवन्द्य च ॥
कृतार्थोऽहं कृतार्थोऽहं कृतार्थोऽहं न संशयः । इति वदेत्॥

These verses beautifully illustrate the solemn process of Viṣṇu *dīkṣā*. The *ācārya* must approach the devotee—whether *brāhmaṇa*, *kṣatriya*, *vaiśya*, or *śūdra*—with words of reassurance (“*mā bhaiṣīḥ*”) and compassion, declaring:
"I shall rescue you without doubt from the ocean of *saṁsāra*.”
After invoking and worshipping Śrīpati (Viṣṇu) with devotion, and meditating upon the guru lineage (*guru-paramparā*), the *ācārya* imprints the Śaṅkha and Cakra upon the disciple's arms using sacred materials such as mud and sandalwood paste, while chanting the corresponding *mantras*.

The disciple is then instructed to declare:
> "अन्तेवासी हरेश्चक्रं धारयामि"
“तथैव च हरेः शङ्खं धारयामि”

—Symbolizing his formal affiliation to the Lord.
Ultimately, the devotee rises, bows to the *ācārya*, and proclaims with full conviction:

> "कृतार्थोऽहं कृतार्थोऽहं कृतार्थोऽहं न संशयः "8 [^246_8]

("I am fulfilled, I am fulfilled, I am fulfilled—without any doubt.")
[^246_8]: Ananda samhitha, 11 adhyaya.

According to this text, the devotee who approaches the temple must first be initiated into Viṣṇu-*dīkṣā*. Thereafter, the priest is to instruct the devotee in the dual nature of the Supreme (*sakala-niṣkala*), the nature of *prakṛti*, the essential identity of the individual *ātma*, and the doctrine of *karma*. Following this, the devotee is gifted a *vigraha* (idol) for daily worship, and encouraged to lead a life of *dharma* while gradually cultivating an understanding of *mokṣa*.
In this way, the methods of *upāsanā* prescribed in the Upaniṣads are made accessible to the lay devotee through the efforts of the Vaikhānasa temple priest. These duties are enjoined upon *arcakas* by the very *śāstra* they follow.
Moreover, several of the subtle doubts and spiritual inquiries arising in the process of practice are addressed in detail in treatises such as the *Uttama Brahma Vidyāsāra*. Therefore, the teachings and procedures of the Vaikhānasa tradition are clearly rooted in Upaniṣadic authority, strengthened by rational inquiry, and proven suitable for practice. They possess the power to bring spiritual welfare (*śreyas*) to all of humanity.

## Conclusion
The Vaikhānasa tradition, deeply rooted in the authority of the Vedas and the contemplative vision of the Upaniṣads, offers a holistic and spiritually inclusive pathway to *mokṣa*. By harmonizing the worship of the *vigraha* (idol) with the internal realization of the formless *Paramātma*, it integrates the *saguṇa* and *nirguṇa* aspects of the divine in a unique doctrinal synthesis. The methodical practices outlined in the *Kalpasūtra*, supported by the insights of sages such as Kaśyapa and Marīci, reveal that *mokṣa* is not merely a posthumous attainment reserved for ascetics or elite ritualists, but a state of liberation accessible to every sincere seeker through devotion (*bhakti*), disciplined living, and scripturally guided worship.
In this light, the role of the Vaikhānasa *arcaka* is not confined to temple rituals but extends into spiritual instruction, guiding devotees in the path of *upāsanā* with philosophical clarity and devotional compassion. The legacy of this tradition—preserved in texts like the *Uttama Brahma Vidyāsāra*—demonstrates that the path to liberation, though ancient in origin, remains eternally relevant, universally accessible, and profoundly transformative.
